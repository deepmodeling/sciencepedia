The metric $d$ is the shortest path distance. The source measure is $\\mu = \\delta_{o}$, a Dirac mass at the junction point $o$. The target measure is $\\nu = \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{y_{1}} + \\frac{2}{3}\\delta_{y_{2}}$, a weighted sum of Dirac masses at the two other endpoints of the graph, where $d(o, y_{1}) = 2$ and $d(o, y_{2}) = 3$. The cost function is $c(x, y) = d(x, y)^{2}$.\n\n1. Infeasibility of the Monge Formulation\n\nThe Monge problem seeks a measurable map $T: X \\to X$ that minimizes the transport cost $\\int_{X} c(x, T(x))\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(x)$, subject to the pushforward constraint $T_{\\#}\\mu = \\nu$. Let us analyze this constraint. The source measure is $\\mu = \\delta_{o}$. The pushforward measure $T_{\\#}\\mu$ is defined by its action on any Borel set $A \\subseteq X$:\n$$ (T_{\\#}\\mu)(A) = \\mu(T^{-1}(A)) = \\delta_{o}(T^{-1}(A)) $$\nBy the definition of the Dirac measure, $\\delta_{o}(S)$ is equal to $1$ if $o \\in S$ and $0$ otherwise. Therefore:\n$$ (T_{\\#}\\mu)(A) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } o \\in T^{-1}(A) \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } o \\notin T^{-1}(A) \\end{cases} $$\nThe condition $o \\in T^{-1}(A)$ is equivalent to $T(o) \\in A$. This implies that the pushforward measure $T_{\\#}\\mu$ is a Dirac measure concentrated at the single point $T(o) \\in X$. That is, $T_{\\#}\\mu = \\delta_{T(o)}$.\n\nThe pushforward constraint $T_{\\#}\\mu = \\nu$ thus becomes:\n$$ \\delta_{T(o)} = \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{y_{1}} + \\frac{2}{3}\\delta_{y_{2}} $$\nThis equation asserts an equality of two measures. For this equality to hold, the measures must agree on all measurable sets. Let us test this for the singleton set $\\{y_{1}\\}$.\nThe measure on the left-hand side gives $\\delta_{T(o)}(\\{y_{1}\\})$, which can only take the value $1$ (if $T(o) = y_{1}$) or $0$ (if $T(o) \\neq y_{1}$).\nThe measure on the right-hand side gives:\n$$ \\nu(\\{y_{1}\\}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{y_{1}} + \\frac{2}{3}\\delta_{y_{2}}\\right)(\\{y_{1}\\}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{y_{1}}(\\{y_{1}\\}) + \\frac{2}{3}\\delta_{y_{2}}(\\{y_{1}\\}) = \\frac{1}{3}(1) + \\frac{2}{3}(0) = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThus, the equality would require $\\delta_{T(o)}(\\{y_{1}\\}) = \\frac{1}{3}$. This is a contradiction, as a Dirac measure of a set can only be $0$ or $1$. The core of the issue is that a map $T$ sends the point $o$ to a single point $T(o)$, so it cannot \"split\" the mass of $\\delta_o$ to be distributed over the two distinct points $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$. Consequently, no such transport map $T$ exists, and the Monge problem is infeasible as it has no admissible solutions.\n\n2. Optimal Kantorovich Coupling\n\nThe Kantorovich problem seeks a probability measure $\\pi$ on the product space $X \\times X$, called a coupling, that has $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ as its marginals and minimizes the total cost $\\int_{X \\times X} c(x, y)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\pi(x, y)$. A coupling $\\pi$ is admissible if for all Borel sets $A, B \\subseteq X$:\n$$ \\pi(A \\times X) = \\mu(A) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\pi(X \\times B) = \\nu(B) $$\nLet's apply the first marginal constraint with $\\mu = \\delta_{o}$. For any Borel set $A \\subseteq X$ such that $o \\notin A$, we have $\\mu(A) = \\delta_{o}(A) = 0$. The constraint implies $\\pi(A \\times X) = 0$. This forces the support of the measure $\\pi$ to be a subset of $\\{o\\} \\times X$. In other words, any admissible coupling $\\pi$ must be of the form $\\pi = \\delta_{o} \\otimes \\rho$ for some probability measure $\\rho$ on $X$.\n\nNow we apply the second marginal constraint. For any Borel set $B \\subseteq X$:\n$$ \\pi(X \\times B) = (\\delta_{o} \\otimes \\rho)(X \\times B) = \\delta_{o}(X) \\rho(B) = (1) \\rho(B) = \\rho(B) $$\nThe constraint $\\pi(X \\times B) = \\nu(B)$ requires that $\\rho(B) = \\nu(B)$ for all Borel sets $B$. This uniquely determines the measure $\\rho$ to be $\\nu$.\nTherefore, there exists only one admissible coupling that satisfies both marginal conditions:\n$$ \\pi = \\delta_{o} \\otimes \\nu $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nu$:\n$$ \\pi = \\delta_{o} \\otimes \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{y_{1}} + \\frac{2}{3}\\delta_{y_{2}}\\right) $$\nBy the bilinearity of the tensor product of measures, this is:\n$$ \\pi = \\frac{1}{3}(\\delta_{o} \\otimes \\delta_{y_{1}}) + \\frac{2}{3}(\\delta_{o} \\otimes \\delta_{y_{2}}) $$\nThis measure can be identified with a measure on $X \\times X$ as $\\pi = \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{(o, y_{1})} + \\frac{2}{3}\\delta_{(o, y_{2})}$, where $\\delta_{(a,b)}$ a Dirac mass at the point $(a,b) \\in X \\times X$.\n\nSince there is only a single admissible coupling $\\pi$, the set of all admissible couplings $\\Pi(\\mu, \\nu)$ is a singleton. The minimization of the cost functional over a singleton set is trivially achieved by the sole element of that set. Thus, this unique coupling $\\pi = \\delta_{o} \\otimes \\nu$ is the optimal Kantorovich coupling. The failure of the Monge formulation alongside the existence of a unique Kantorovich coupling is characteristic of problems involving mass splitting. This situation underscores why the Kantorovich relaxation is essential. Theories like curvature-dimension CD(K,N) often provide conditions for the existence of an optimal transport *map* (a Monge solution), but these typically require the source measure to be absolutely continuous with respect to the reference measure $m$ and the space to be non-branching—conditions which are clearly violated in this problem setup.\n\n3. Computation of the Optimal Cost\n\nThe optimal Kantorovich cost is the value of the transport cost functional evaluated for the optimal coupling $\\pi$.\n$$ \\text{Cost} = \\int_{X \\times X} c(x, y)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\pi(x, y) = \\int_{X \\times X} d(x, y)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\pi(x, y) $$\nSubstituting the optimal coupling $\\pi = \\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{(o, y_{1})} + \\frac{2}{3}\\delta_{(o, y_{2})}$:\n$$ \\text{Cost} = \\int_{X \\times X} d(x, y)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{(o, y_{1})} + \\frac{2}{3}\\delta_{(o, y_{2})}\\right) $$\nBy the linearity of integration:\n$$ \\text{Cost} = \\frac{1}{3}\\int_{X \\times X} d(x, y)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\delta_{(o, y_{1})} + \\frac{2}{3}\\int_{X \\times X} d(x, y)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\delta_{(o, y_{2})} $$\nThe integral of a function $f(p)$ against a Dirac measure $\\delta_{p_0}$ is $f(p_0)$. Applying this rule:\n$$ \\text{Cost} = \\frac{1}{3}d(o, y_{1})^{2} + \\frac{2}{3}d(o, y_{2})^{2} $$\nThe problem provides the distances $d(o, y_{1}) = 2$ and $d(o, y_{2}) = 3$. Substituting these values:\n$$ \\text{Cost} = \\frac{1}{3}(2)^{2} + \\frac{2}{3}(3)^{2} = \\frac{1}{3}(4) + \\frac{2}{3}(9) = \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{18}{3} = \\frac{22}{3} $$\nThe optimal Kantorovich cost is $\\frac{22}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{22}{3}}\n$$", "id": "3032195"}, {"introduction": "With the foundational framework in place, we now turn to a concrete calculation of the Wasserstein distance and the construction of a geodesic in the space of probability measures.

We use the standard product rules from multivariable calculus:\n- Gradient of a product: $\\nabla(fg) = f\\nabla g + g\\nabla f$.\n- Laplacian of a product: $\\Delta(fg) = \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla(fg) = \\nabla \\cdot (f\\nabla g + g\\nabla f) = (\\nabla f \\cdot \\nabla g + f\\Delta g) + (\\nabla g \\cdot \\nabla f + g\\Delta f) = f\\Delta g + g\\Delta f + 2\\langle\\nabla f, \\nabla g\\rangle$.\n\nNow, we compute $L(fg)$:\n$$\nL(fg) = \\Delta(fg) - \\langle x, \\nabla(fg) \\rangle = \\big( f\\Delta g + g\\Delta f + 2\\langle\\nabla f, \\nabla g\\rangle \\big) - \\langle x, f\\nabla g + g\\nabla f \\rangle\n$$\n$$\nL(fg) = f\\Delta g + g\\Delta f + 2\\langle\\nabla f, \\nabla g\\rangle - f\\langle x, \\nabla g \\rangle - g\\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle\n$$\nNext, we expand the terms $f\\,Lg$ and $g\\,Lf$:\n$$\nf\\,Lg = f(\\Delta g - \\langle x, \\nabla g \\rangle) = f\\Delta g - f\\langle x, \\nabla g \\rangle\n$$\n$$\ng\\,Lf = g(\\Delta f - \\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle) = g\\Delta f - g\\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle\n$$\nWe substitute these expressions back into the definition of $\\Gamma(f,g)$:\n$$\n2\\,\\Gamma(f,g) = \\big( f\\Delta g + g\\Delta f + 2\\langle\\nabla f, \\nabla g\\rangle - f\\langle x, \\nabla g \\rangle - g\\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle \\big) - \\big(f\\Delta g - f\\langle x, \\nabla g \\rangle\\big) - \\big(g\\Delta f - g\\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle\\big)\n$$\nThe terms $f\\Delta g$, $g\\Delta f$, $f\\langle x, \\nabla g \\rangle$, and $g\\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle$ all cancel out, leaving:\n$$\n2\\,\\Gamma(f,g) = 2\\langle\\nabla f, \\nabla g\\rangle\n$$\nThus, the explicit formula for the carré du champ is:\n$$\n\\Gamma(f,g) = \\langle\\nabla f, \\nabla g\\rangle\n$$\nAnd for $g=f$, we have $\\Gamma(f) \\coloneqq \\Gamma(f,f)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(f) = \\langle\\nabla f, \\nabla f\\rangle = |\\nabla f|^2\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the iterated carré du champ operator $\\Gamma_2(f)$. By definition,\n$$\n\\Gamma_2(f) \\coloneqq \\frac{1}{2}\\big(L\\,\\Gamma(f) - 2\\,\\Gamma(f, L f)\\big)\n$$\nWe compute the two terms separately. First, $L\\,\\Gamma(f) = L(|\\nabla f|^2)$.\nWe need the gradient and Laplacian of $|\\nabla f|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\partial_i f)^2$. The $k$-th component of the gradient is:\n$$\n(\\nabla|\\nabla f|^2)_k = \\partial_k \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\partial_i f)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n 2(\\partial_i f)(\\partial_{ki} f) = 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n H_{ki}(f) (\\partial_i f)\n$$\nwhere $H(f)$ is the Hessian matrix of $f$, with entries $H_{ij}(f) = \\partial_{ij} f$. In vector notation, this is $\\nabla(|\\nabla f|^2) = 2 H(f) \\nabla f$.\nThe Laplacian is the divergence of the gradient:\n$$\n\\Delta(|\\nabla f|^2) = \\nabla \\cdot (2 H(f) \\nabla f) = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\partial_k \\left( 2 \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\partial_i f)(\\partial_{ki} f) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= 2 \\sum_{k,i=1}^n \\left( (\\partial_{ki} f)(\\partial_{ki} f) + (\\partial_i f)(\\partial_{kki} f) \\right)\n$$\nThe first term is $2\\sum_{k,i}(\\partial_{ki}f)^2 = 2|H(f)|_{HS}^2$, where $|\\cdot|_{HS}$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. The second term, by interchanging order of summation and differentiation (Clairaut's theorem for smooth functions), is $2\\sum_{i}(\\partial_i f) \\partial_i (\\sum_k \\partial_{kk}f) = 2\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) \\rangle$.\nSo, $\\Delta(|\\nabla f|^2) = 2|H(f)|_{HS}^2 + 2\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) \\rangle$.\nNow we can write $L(\\Gamma(f))$:\n$$\nL(\\Gamma(f)) = L(|\\nabla f|^2) = \\Delta(|\\nabla f|^2) - \\langle x, \\nabla(|\\nabla f|^2) \\rangle = 2|H(f)|_{HS}^2 + 2\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) \\rangle - \\langle x, 2 H(f) \\nabla f \\rangle\n$$\nThe second term we need for $\\Gamma_2(f)$ is $\\Gamma(f, L f)$. Using our formula $\\Gamma(f,g) = \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla g \\rangle$, we have:\n$$\n\\Gamma(f, L f) = \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(L f) \\rangle\n$$\nWe compute $\\nabla(Lf) = \\nabla(\\Delta f - \\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle) = \\nabla(\\Delta f) - \\nabla(\\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle)$.\nThe $k$-th component of $\\nabla(\\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle)$ is $\\partial_k(\\sum_j x_j \\partial_j f) = \\sum_j (\\delta_{kj}\\partial_j f + x_j \\partial_{kj} f) = \\partial_k f + \\sum_j x_j H_{kj}(f)$. In vector form, $\\nabla(\\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle) = \\nabla f + H(f)x$.\nSo, $\\nabla(Lf) = \\nabla(\\Delta f) - \\nabla f - H(f)x$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Gamma(f, L f)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(f, L f) = \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) - \\nabla f - H(f)x \\rangle = \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) \\rangle - |\\nabla f|^2 - \\langle \\nabla f, H(f)x \\rangle\n$$\nNow we assemble $\\Gamma_2(f)$:\n$$\n2\\Gamma_2(f) = L(\\Gamma(f)) - 2\\Gamma(f, L f)\n$$\n$$\n= \\left( 2|H(f)|_{HS}^2 + 2\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) \\rangle - 2\\langle x, H(f) \\nabla f \\rangle \\right) - 2\\left( \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) \\rangle - |\\nabla f|^2 - \\langle \\nabla f, H(f)x \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nSince the Hessian matrix $H(f)$ is symmetric, $\\langle x, H(f) \\nabla f \\rangle = \\langle H(f)x, \\nabla f \\rangle = \\langle \\nabla f, H(f)x \\rangle$. Thus, these terms cancel. The terms involving $\\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) \\rangle$ also cancel.\n$$\n2\\Gamma_2(f) = 2|H(f)|_{HS}^2 - (-2|\\nabla f|^2) = 2|H(f)|_{HS}^2 + 2|\\nabla f|^2\n$$\nThe explicit formula for the iterated carré du champ is:\n$$\n\\Gamma_2(f) = |H(f)|_{HS}^2 + |\\nabla f|^2\n$$\nFinally, we determine the optimal parameters $K$ and $N$ for the CD(K,N) condition, which is the pointwise inequality:\n$$\n\\Gamma_2(f) \\ge K\\,\\Gamma(f) + \\frac{1}{N}\\,(L f)^2\n$$\nSubstituting our computed expressions:\n$$\n|H(f)|_{HS}^2 + |\\nabla f|^2 \\ge K\\,|\\nabla f|^2 + \\frac{1}{N}\\,(L f)^2\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the inequality that must hold for all smooth functions $f$ at all points $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$\n(1-K)|\\nabla f|^2 + |H(f)|_{HS}^2 - \\frac{1}{N}\\,(L f)^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nTo find the sharpest parameters, we test this inequality with specific functions. Consider a non-constant linear function $f(x) = \\langle a, x \\rangle$ for a fixed non-zero vector $a \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. For this function, we compute:\n- $\\nabla f = a$, so $|\\nabla f|^2 = |a|^2$.\n- $H(f) = 0$, the zero matrix, so $|H(f)|_{HS}^2 = 0$.\n- $\\Delta f = 0$.\n- $L f = \\Delta f - \\langle x, \\nabla f \\rangle = 0 - \\langle x, a \\rangle = -\\langle x, a \\rangle$.\n\nSubstituting these into the inequality gives:\n$$\n(1-K)|a|^2 + 0 - \\frac{1}{N}\\,(-\\langle x, a \\rangle)^2 \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\n(1-K)|a|^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{N}\\,\\langle x, a \\rangle^2\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. The left-hand side is a constant for a given $f$. The right-hand side, however, depends on $x$. Since $a \\neq 0$, the term $\\langle x, a \\rangle^2$ is unbounded as $|x| \\to \\infty$. Given that $N \\in (n, \\infty]$, $1/N$ is non-negative. If $N$ were finite, $1/N > 0$, and the right-hand side could be made arbitrarily large, which would violate the inequality. Thus, for the inequality to hold for all $x$, we must have the coefficient of the $x$-dependent term equal to zero. This implies $1/N = 0$, so we must have $N=\\infty$. This is the \"smallest\" value in the allowed set $(n, \\infty]$ that can satisfy the condition.\n\nWith $N=\\infty$, the term $\\frac{1}{N}(Lf)^2$ vanishes, and the inequality simplifies to:\n$$\n(1-K)|\\nabla f|^2 + |H(f)|_{HS}^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nThis must hold for all smooth functions $f$. Using our test function $f(x)=\\langle a, x \\rangle$ again, for which $|\\nabla f|^2=|a|^2$ and $H(f)=0$, the inequality becomes:\n$$\n(1-K)|a|^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nSince this must be true for any choice of vector $a \\neq 0$, we must have the coefficient $(1-K) \\ge 0$, which implies $K \\le 1$. To find the largest possible curvature lower bound, we take the supremum, which is $K=1$.\n\nWe now verify if the pair $(K,N)=(1, \\infty)$ satisfies the condition for all smooth functions $f$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\n(1-1)|\\nabla f|^2 + |H(f)|_{HS}^2 \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\n|H(f)|_{HS}^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nThe Hilbert-Schmidt norm squared of the Hessian matrix is given by $|H(f)|_{HS}^2 = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n (\\partial_{ij}f)^2$. As a sum of squares of real numbers, this quantity is always non-negative. Therefore, the condition is satisfied for all smooth functions $f$.\n\nThe largest value for $K$ is $1$ and the corresponding smallest value for $N \\in (n, \\infty]$ is $\\infty$. The pair is $(K,N) = (1, \\infty)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & \\infty\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3032188"}]}
