Do not round your answer.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The objects under consideration, the $n$-spheres with their standard geodesic distances, are canonical in Riemannian and metric geometry. The question asks for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between these two metric spaces, a well-defined quantity.\n\nLet the two metric spaces be $X = (S^n, d_1)$ and $Y = (S^n, d_R)$. Here, $S^n$ is the standard $n$-dimensional sphere, $d_1$ is its intrinsic geodesic distance when its radius is $1$, and $d_R$ is its intrinsic geodesic distance when its radius is $R > 0$.\n\nThe geodesic distance between any two points $p_1, p_2$ on a sphere of radius $\\rho$ is given by $\\rho \\cdot \\theta(p_1, p_2)$, where $\\theta(p_1, p_2)$ is the great-circle angle between them, with $\\theta(p_1, p_2) \\in [0, \\pi]$.\nThus, for our spaces $X$ and $Y$, the distances are:\n$$d_1(p_1, p_2) = 1 \\cdot \\theta(p_1, p_2) = \\theta(p_1, p_2)$$\n$$d_R(p_1, p_2) = R \\cdot \\theta(p_1, p_2)$$\n\nThe Gromov-Hausdorff distance, $d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X, Y)$, between two compact metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ is defined as:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\inf_{C} \\operatorname{dis}(C)$$\nwhere the infimum is taken over all correspondences $C \\subseteq X \\times Y$. A correspondence is a relation such that its projections onto $X$ and $Y$ are surjective. The quantity $\\operatorname{dis}(C)$ is the distortion of the correspondence $C$, defined as:\n$$\\operatorname{dis}(C) = \\sup \\left\\{ |d_X(x_1, x_2) - d_Y(y_1, y_2)| \\mid (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2) \\in C \\right\\}$$\n\nWe can find a sharp value for $d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X, Y)$ by establishing matching upper and lower bounds.\n\n**1. Upper Bound**\n\nSince the underlying topological space for both metric spaces is $S^n$, we can consider the most natural correspondence: the identity map. Let $C_{\\mathrm{id}} = \\{ (p, p) \\mid p \\in S^n \\}$. This is a valid correspondence (in fact, a bijection). We calculate its distortion:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{dis}(C_{\\mathrm{id}}) &= \\sup_{p_1, p_2 \\in S^n} |d_1(p_1, p_2) - d_R(p_1, p_2)| \\\\\n&= \\sup_{p_1, p_2 \\in S^n} |\\theta(p_1, p_2) - R \\cdot \\theta(p_1, p_2)| \\\\\n&= \\sup_{p_1, p_2 \\in S^n} |1-R| \\cdot \\theta(p_1, p_2) \\\\\n&= |1-R| \\sup_{p_1, p_2 \\in S^n} \\theta(p_1, p_2)\n\\end{align*}\nThe maximum angle between any two points on a sphere is $\\pi$, a value achieved for any pair of antipodal points. Therefore:\n$$\\sup_{p_1, p_2 \\in S^n} \\theta(p_1, p_2) = \\pi$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the distortion gives:\n$$\\operatorname{dis}(C_{\\mathrm{id}}) = \\pi |1-R| = \\pi |R-1|$$\nBy the definition of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, using this specific correspondence provides an upper bound:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{GH}}((S^n, d_1), (S^n, d_R)) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{dis}(C_{\\mathrm{id}}) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} |R-1|$$\n\n**2. Lower Bound**\n\nA fundamental property of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is that for any two compact metric spaces $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$, it is bounded below by half the absolute difference of their diameters:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{GH}}(X, Y) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} |\\operatorname{diam}(X) - \\operatorname{diam}(Y)|$$\nThe diameter of a metric space is the supremum of the distances between any two of its points.\nFor our space $X = (S^n, d_1)$:\n$$\\operatorname{diam}(X) = \\sup_{p_1, p_2 \\in S^n} d_1(p_1, p_2) = \\sup_{p_1, p_2 \\in S^n} \\theta(p_1, p_2) = \\pi$$\nFor our space $Y = (S^n, d_R)$:\n$$\\operatorname{diam}(Y) = \\sup_{p_1, p_2 \\in S^n} d_R(p_1, p_2) = \\sup_{p_1, p_2 \\in S^n} R \\cdot \\theta(p_1, p_2) = R\\pi$$\nApplying the diameter inequality, we get the lower bound:\n\\begin{align*}\nd_{\\mathrm{GH}}((S^n, d_1), (S^n, d_R)) &\\ge \\frac{1}{2} |\\operatorname{diam}(X) - \\operatorname{diam}(Y)| \\\\\n&\\ge \\frac{1}{2} |\\pi - R\\pi| \\\\\n&\\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} |1-R| \\\\\n&\\ge \\frac{\\pi}{2} |R-1|\n\\end{align*}\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nWe have established the following inequality:\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{2} |R-1| \\le d_{\\mathrm{GH}}((S^n, d_1), (S^n, d_R)) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2} |R-1|$$\nThis forces the Gromov-Hausdorff distance to be exactly equal to this value. The fact that the upper bound derived from the identity correspondence matches the general lower bound derived from the diameters implies that the identity correspondence is an optimal one for this pair of spaces.\n\nTherefore, the sharp closed-form expression for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance is:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{GH}}((S^n, d_1), (S^n, d_R)) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} |R-1|$$\nThis result holds for any dimension $n \\ge 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}|R-1|}$$", "id": "3026660"}, {"introduction": "Ricci limit spaces are often singular, and their local structure is modeled by tangent cones, which are themselves metric cones.

As $r_i \\to 0$, the torus becomes progressively thinner in the direction of the second coordinate, collapsing onto the circle corresponding to the first coordinate.
