It is a space of constant sectional curvature $K$. The sectional curvature is related to the radius $r$ by $K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$.\n\nFor a Riemannian manifold of dimension $n$ with constant sectional curvature $K$, its Ricci curvature tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g} = (n-1) K g\n$$\nSubstituting $K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$ for the sphere $S^n(r)$, we obtain its Ricci tensor:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g} = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} g\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g}$ into the soliton equation:\n$$\n\\frac{n-1}{r^2} g + \\nabla^{2}f = \\lambda g\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to isolate the Hessian of the potential function $f$, $\\nabla^{2}f$:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2}f = \\lambda g - \\frac{n-1}{r^2} g = \\left(\\lambda - \\frac{n-1}{r^2}\\right) g\n$$\nLet us define a constant $C = \\lambda - \\frac{n-1}{r^2}$. The equation for the potential function $f$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2}f = C g\n$$\nThis equation imposes a strong constraint on the function $f$ on the manifold $S^n(r)$. To determine the nature of $f$ and the value of $C$, we can take the trace of this tensor equation with respect to the metric $g$.\n\nThe trace of the Hessian, $\\mathrm{tr}_{g}(\\nabla^{2}f)$, is the Laplacian of $f$, which we denote by $\\Delta f$. So, $\\mathrm{tr}_{g}(\\nabla^{2}f) = \\Delta f$.\nThe trace of the metric tensor, $\\mathrm{tr}_{g}(g) = g^{ij}g_{ij}$, is equal to the dimension of the manifold, which is $n$.\nTaking the trace of both sides of $\\nabla^{2}f = C g$, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta f = C n\n$$\nThe manifold $S^n(r)$ is a compact manifold without boundary. A fundamental result from differential geometry, a consequence of the Divergence Theorem (also known as Green's identity), states that for any smooth function $h$ on a compact manifold $M$ without boundary, the integral of its Laplacian over the manifold is zero:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\Delta h \\, dV_g = 0\n$$\nApplying this result to our function $f$ on $S^n(r)$, we must have:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n(r)} \\Delta f \\, dV_g = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta f = nC$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n(r)} nC \\, dV_g = nC \\int_{S^n(r)} dV_g = nC \\cdot \\mathrm{Vol}(S^n(r)) = 0\n$$\nThe dimension $n$ is at least $2$, and the volume of the sphere, $\\mathrm{Vol}(S^n(r))$, is strictly positive. Therefore, the only way for this equation to hold is if the constant $C$ is zero:\n$$\nC = 0\n$$\nThis implies that $\\nabla^{2}f = 0$. The Hessian of $f$ is the zero tensor.\nThis has a further implication for the function $f$ on a compact manifold. Taking the trace, we again have $\\Delta f = 0$. Using Green's first identity:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n(r)} |\\nabla f|^2 \\, dV_g = - \\int_{S^n(r)} f (\\Delta f) \\, dV_g\n$$\nSince $\\Delta f = 0$, the integral on the right-hand side is zero. Thus:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n(r)} |\\nabla f|^2 \\, dV_g = 0\n$$\nThe integrand $|\\nabla f|^2$ is the squared norm of the gradient of $f$, and it is everywhere non-negative. For its integral over the manifold to be zero, the integrand must be identically zero. Therefore, $|\\nabla f|^2 = 0$ everywhere on $S^n(r)$, which implies that the gradient vector field $\\nabla f$ is the zero vector field. A function whose gradient is zero everywhere on a connected manifold must be a constant function.\n\nSo, we have determined that the potential function $f$ must be a constant function, i.e., $f(x) = f_0$ for some $f_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Any constant function is a valid potential. For simplicity, we can choose $f=0$.\n\nWith $f$ being a constant function, its Hessian $\\nabla^2 f$ is identically zero. We can now substitute this back into the soliton equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}_{g} + 0 = \\lambda g \\implies \\mathrm{Ric}_{g} = \\lambda g\n$$\nThis shows that the sphere, when considered as a trivial gradient soliton (with constant potential), must be an Einstein manifold, which we already know to be true. The soliton constant $\\lambda$ is simply the Einstein constant.\n\nUsing our established expression for the Ricci tensor of the sphere, $\\mathrm{Ric}_{g} = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} g$, we can equate the two expressions:\n$$\n\\lambda g = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} g\n$$\nThis equality must hold for the non-degenerate tensor $g$, which allows us to conclude:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{n-1}{r^2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a gradient *shrinking* Ricci soliton, which requires $\\lambda > 0$. Given the constraints $n \\ge 2$ and $r>0$:\n- If $n=2$, $\\lambda = \\frac{2-1}{r^2} = \\frac{1}{r^2} > 0$.\n- If $n > 2$, $n-1 > 1$, so $\\lambda = \\frac{n-1}{r^2} > 0$.\nIn all cases for $n \\ge 2$, the constant $\\lambda$ is positive.\n\nThus, a valid potential function is any constant function, $f=f_0$. With this choice, the sphere $S^n(r)$ becomes a gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with soliton constant $\\lambda = \\frac{n-1}{r^2}$.

Since the metric is the Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{E}}$ for all time $s \\in [0, \\tau]$, the scalar curvature $R(\\gamma(s), s)$ is identically zero. The metric $g(s)$ in the norm is also $g_{\\mathrm{E}}$. Therefore, the functional simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\gamma) = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\sqrt{s}\\,\\big|\\gamma'(s)\\big|_{g_{\\mathrm{E}}}^{2}\\,ds\n$$\nWe need to find the infimum of this functional over all paths $\\gamma:[0,\\tau] \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\\gamma(0) = o = 0$ and $\\gamma(\\tau) = x$. This is a problem in the calculus of variations. The Lagrangian is $L(s, \\gamma, \\gamma') = \\sqrt{s} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\dot{\\gamma}^i(s))^2$. The Euler-Lagrange equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\gamma}^i}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\gamma^i} = 0\n$$\nSince $L$ does not depend on $\\gamma^i$, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\gamma^i} = 0$.

The volume measure $d\\mu_{g(\\tau)}(x)$ is simply the standard Lebesgue measure $dx$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ since $g(\\tau) = g_{\\mathrm{E}}$.\n$$\n\\widetilde{V}(\\tau) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} (4\\pi \\tau)^{-n/2}\\,\\exp\\!\\big(-l(x,\\tau)\\big)\\,dx\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $l(x,\\tau)$:\n$$\n\\widetilde{V}(\\tau) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} (4\\pi \\tau)^{-n/2}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4\\tau}\\right)\\,dx\n$$\nThis is a standard multi-dimensional Gaussian integral. The integrand is the heat kernel for the heat equation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We can evaluate it by separating the variables $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, so $|x|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$ and $dx = dx_1 \\dots dx_n$.\n$$\n\\widetilde{V}(\\tau) = (4\\pi \\tau)^{-n/2} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{4\\tau}\\right) dx_1 \\dots dx_n\n$$\n$$\n\\widetilde{V}(\\tau) = (4\\pi \\tau)^{-n/2} \\prod_{i=1}^n \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_i^2}{4\\tau}\\right) dx_i\n$$\nWe use the standard Gaussian integral formula $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ay^2} dy = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$. Here, $a = \\frac{1}{4\\tau}$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_i^2}{4\\tau}\\right) dx_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{1/(4\\tau)}} = \\sqrt{4\\pi\\tau}\n$$\nThe product of $n$ such identical integrals is $(\\sqrt{4\\pi\\tau})^n = (4\\pi\\tau)^{n/2}$.\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\widetilde{V}(\\tau)$:\n$$\n\\widetilde{V}(\\tau) = (4\\pi \\tau)^{-n/2} \\cdot (4\\pi\\tau)^{n/2} = 1\n$$\nThe value of the reduced volume $\\widetilde{V}(\\tau)$ is $1$ for all $\\tau > 0$. This demonstrates that it is constant in $\\tau$, and its constant value is $1$. This result is consistent with the general theory of reduced volume for shrinking Ricci solitons.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3006926"}]}
