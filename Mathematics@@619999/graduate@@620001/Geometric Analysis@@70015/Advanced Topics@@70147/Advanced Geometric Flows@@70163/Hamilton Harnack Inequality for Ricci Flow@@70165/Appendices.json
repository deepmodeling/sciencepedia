The rate of change of the metric is given by the Ricci flow equation, $\\partial_{t} g_{ij} = -2 R_{ij}$. We can thus identify the variation tensor field $h_{ij}$ with $\\partial_t g_{ij}$. So we set $h_{ij} = -2 R_{ij}$.\n\nThe problem provides the first variation formula for the scalar curvature $R$ under a metric variation $h_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\delta R = -\\langle \\mathrm{Ric}, h \\rangle + \\nabla^{i} \\nabla^{j} h_{ij} - \\Delta(\\mathrm{tr}\\, h)\n$$\nHere, $\\delta R$ represents the change in $R$ corresponding to the variation $h$, which in our case is the time derivative $\\partial_t R$. Let's substitute $h_{ij} = -2 R_{ij}$ into this formula and analyze each term.\n\n1.  **First term:** $-\\langle \\mathrm{Ric}, h \\rangle$\n    The inner product is $\\langle \\mathrm{Ric}, h \\rangle = g^{ik}g^{jl}R_{ij}h_{kl} = R^{kl}h_{kl}$.\n    Substituting $h_{kl} = -2 R_{kl}$:\n    $$\n    -\\langle \\mathrm{Ric}, -2\\mathrm{Ric} \\rangle = 2 \\langle \\mathrm{Ric}, \\mathrm{Ric} \\rangle = 2 R^{kl} R_{kl} = 2 |\\mathrm{Ric}|^2\n    $$\n    This is one of the terms in the target equation.\n\n2.  **Second term:** $\\nabla^{i} \\nabla^{j} h_{ij}$\n    Substituting $h_{ij} = -2 R_{ij}$:\n    $$\n    \\nabla^{i} \\nabla^{j} (-2 R_{ij}) = -2 \\nabla^{i} \\nabla^{j} R_{ij}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Third term:** $-\\Delta(\\mathrm{tr}\\, h)$\n    First, we compute the trace of $h_{ij}$:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{tr}(h) = g^{ij} h_{ij} = g^{ij} (-2 R_{ij}) = -2 g^{ij} R_{ij} = -2 R\n    $$\n    Now, we apply the negative Laplacian:\n    $$\n    -\\Delta(\\mathrm{tr}(h)) = -\\Delta(-2 R) = 2 \\Delta R\n    $$\n\nCombining these three terms, we obtain an expression for the time evolution of the scalar curvature:\n$$\n\\partial_t R = 2 |\\mathrm{Ric}|^2 - 2 \\nabla^{i} \\nabla^{j} R_{ij} + 2 \\Delta R\n$$\nTo match this with the target form $\\partial_{t} R = c\\, \\Delta R + 2\\, |\\mathrm{Ric}|^{2}$, we must simplify the term $-2 \\nabla^{i} \\nabla^{j} R_{ij}$.\n\n**Step 3: Simplification using the Bianchi Identity**\n\nThe problem provides the contracted second Bianchi identity:\n$$\n\\nabla^{i} R_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_{j} R\n$$\nLet's take the divergence of this identity by applying $\\nabla^j$ (which is $g^{jk}\\nabla_k$):\n$$\n\\nabla^j (\\nabla^i R_{ij}) = \\nabla^j \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla_j R\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} g^{jk} \\nabla_j \\nabla_k R = \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta R\n$$\nWe now have an expression for $\\nabla^j (\\nabla^i R_{ij})$. The term in our evolution equation is $\\nabla^i \\nabla^j R_{ij}$. In general, covariant derivatives do not commute. We must check if $\\nabla^i \\nabla^j R_{ij} = \\nabla^j (\\nabla^i R_{ij})$.\n\nThe commutator of double covariant derivatives acting on a $(0,2)$-tensor $T_{ij}$ is given by the Ricci identity:\n$$\n(\\nabla_a \\nabla_b - \\nabla_b \\nabla_a) T_{ij} = R^p_{\\,iab} T_{pj} + R^p_{\\,jab} T_{ip}\n$$\nThe sign conventions for the Riemann tensor $R^p_{\\,iab}$ are consistent with the problem statement. We want to compute the commutator $[\\nabla^i, \\nabla^j]R_{ij} = g^{ia} g^{jb} (\\nabla_a \\nabla_b - \\nabla_b \\nabla_a) R_{ij}$.\n$$\ng^{ia} g^{jb} (\\nabla_a \\nabla_b - \\nabla_b \\nabla_a) R_{ij} = g^{ia} g^{jb} (R^p_{\\,iab} R_{pj} + R^p_{\\,jab} R_{ip})\n$$\nLet's evaluate the two terms separately:\n*   First term: $g^{ia} g^{jb} R^p_{\\,iab} R_{pj} = g^{jb} (g^{ia}R^p_{\\,iab}) R_{pj}$. The contracted Riemann tensor $g^{ia} R^p_{\\,iab} = R^{pa}_{\\ \\ ab}$ is, by definition of the Ricci tensor ($R_{kb} = R^a_{\\,kab}$), equal to $R^p_b$. So, this term becomes $g^{jb} R^p_b R_{pj} = R^{jp} R_{pj} = |\\mathrm{Ric}|^2$.\n*   Second term: $g^{ia} g^{jb} R^p_{\\,jab} R_{ip} = g^{ia} (g^{jb}R^p_{\\,jab}) R_{ip}$. The contraction $g^{jb}R^p_{\\,jab} = R^{p\\ b}_{\\ \\ ab}$. Using the symmetries of the Riemann tensor, $R^{p\\ b}_{\\ \\ ab} = g^{pk} g^{bl} R_{klab} = g^{pk} g^{bl} (-R_{klba}) = -g^{pk} R^l_{\\,kla} = -R^p_a$. So, this term becomes $g^{ia} (-R^p_a) R_{ip} = -R^{pi} R_{ip} = -|\\mathrm{Ric}|^2$.\n\nThe sum of these two terms is $|\\mathrm{Ric}|^2 - |\\mathrm{Ric}|^2 = 0$. Therefore, the commutator is zero:\n$$\n\\nabla^i \\nabla^j R_{ij} - \\nabla^j \\nabla^i R_{ij} = 0 \\implies \\nabla^i \\nabla^j R_{ij} = \\nabla^j \\nabla^i R_{ij}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for this specific double contraction, the order of covariant differentiation does not matter. Thus, we can write:\n$$\n\\nabla^i \\nabla^j R_{ij} = \\nabla^j (\\nabla^i R_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta R\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Final Result**\n\nNow substitute this result back into our evolution equation for $R$:\n$$\n\\partial_t R = 2 |\\mathrm{Ric}|^2 - 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta R\\right) + 2 \\Delta R\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_t R = 2 |\\mathrm{Ric}|^2 - \\Delta R + 2 \\Delta R\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_t R = \\Delta R + 2 |\\mathrm{Ric}|^2\n$$\nComparing this to the target form $\\partial_{t} R = c\\, \\Delta R + 2\\, |\\mathrm{Ric}|^{2}$, we can identify the coefficient $c$.\n$$\nc = 1\n$$\nThe coefficient is a dimensionless real number, $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3029386"}, {"introduction": "Abstract inequalities in geometry gain their power from how they behave on concrete examples.

Taking the time derivative, we get:\n$$ \\partial_t g_{ij}(t) = \\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} (g_0)_{ij} $$\nNext, we determine the Ricci tensor of $g(t)$. The metric $g(t)$ is a round metric. Let its constant sectional curvature at time $t$ be $k(t)$. Under a homothetic scaling of the metric $g(t) = \\lambda(t) g_0$, the sectional curvature scales as $k(t) = k_0 / \\lambda(t)$.\nUsing the provided identity for a round metric, the Ricci tensor of $g(t)$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = (n-1)k(t)g(t) = (n-1) \\frac{k_0}{\\lambda(t)} (\\lambda(t)g_0) = (n-1)k_0 g_0 $$\nNow, we substitute these expressions for the left-hand side and right-hand side into the Ricci flow equation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} g_0 = -2 (n-1)k_0 g_0 $$\nFor this tensor equation to hold, the scalar coefficients must be equal, which gives a differential equation for $\\lambda(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = -2(n-1)k_0 $$\nWe integrate this ODE with respect to $t$. The initial condition $g(0) = g_0$ implies $\\lambda(0) g_0 = g_0$, so $\\lambda(0)=1$.\n$$ \\int_1^{\\lambda(t)} d\\lambda' = \\int_0^t -2(n-1)k_0 dt' $$\n$$ \\lambda(t) - 1 = -2(n-1)k_0 t $$\n$$ \\lambda(t) = 1 - 2(n-1)k_0 t $$\nThe scalar curvature $R(t)$ of the metric $g(t)$ is given by the identity $R(t) = n(n-1)k(t)$.

The inequality simplifies to:\n$$ \\partial_{t} R + 2 R_{ij} V^{i} V^{j} + \\frac{2}{t}\\, R \\geq 0 $$\nIn more invariant notation, this is $\\partial_{t} R + 2 \\operatorname{Ric}(V,V) + \\frac{2}{t}\\, R \\geq 0$.\nThe problem asks for a choice of the tangent vector $V$ that minimizes the Harnack quantity (the left-hand side of the inequality) at each space-time point. The terms $\\partial_{t} R$ and $\\frac{2}{t} R$ depend only on time $t$, not on the vector $V$ at a point. Therefore, minimizing the Harnack quantity is equivalent to minimizing the term $2\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V)$.\nThe Ricci tensor is $\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = (n-1)k(t)g(t)$. Since $k_0 > 0$ and the flow exists for $\\lambda(t) = 1 - 2(n-1)k_0 t > 0$, the sectional curvature $k(t) = k_0/\\lambda(t)$ is strictly positive. Thus, the tensor $(n-1)k(t)g(t)$ is positive definite.\nThe quadratic form $\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V) = (n-1)k(t)g(t)(V,V) = (n-1)k(t)|V|^2_{g(t)}$ is minimized if and only if $|V|_{g(t)}$ is minimized. The minimum value is $0$, which is achieved uniquely when $V$ is the zero vector, $V=0$.\nTherefore, the \"suitable\" choice of $V$ is the zero vector.\nThe problem defines \"sharp\" in this context as the case where the left-hand side equals the infimum over all $V$. Since $\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V) \\geq 0$ for all $V$, the infimum of the Harnack quantity is $\\partial_{t} R + \\frac{2}{t} R$, and this value is attained precisely when $\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V)=0$, i.e., for $V=0$. Thus, the choice $V=0$ makes the inequality \"sharp\" in the sense specified.\n\n#### **Part 3: The Pair $(R(t), \\operatorname{Ric}(V,V))$**\nWe are asked to compute $\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V)$ for our chosen $V=0$. First, we find the general expression for $\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V)$ in terms of $R(t)$ and the norm of $V$.\nWe know $\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = (n-1)k(t)g(t)$ and $R(t) = n(n-1)k(t)$. From the second identity, we can express the sectional curvature as $k(t) = \\frac{R(t)}{n(n-1)}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the Ricci tensor:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = (n-1)\\left(\\frac{R(t)}{n(n-1)}\\right) g(t) = \\frac{R(t)}{n} g(t) $$\nThen, the quadratic form $\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V)$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}(V,V) = g^{ij}(\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)))_{ik} V^k V_j = \\left(\\frac{R(t)}{n}g(t)\\right)(V,V) = \\frac{R(t)}{n} |V|^2_{g(t)} $$\nFor the chosen vector $V=0$, its norm $|V|_{g(t)}$ is $0$.

With the metric component $dz^2$, the vector field $\\partial_z$ is a unit vector field, so we can set $V = \\partial_z$.\n\nWe compute each term in the expression for $\\mathcal{H}(V)$:\n1.  **Scalar Curvature $R$ and its time derivative $\\partial_t R$**: The scalar curvature of a product manifold is the sum of the scalar curvatures of its factors. The scalar curvature of $(\\mathbb{R}, dz^2)$ is $0$. For the spherical factor with metric $g_S(t)$, which is a sphere of radius $r(t)$, fact (i) gives its scalar curvature as $R_S(t) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{r(t)^2}$. Therefore, the total scalar curvature is:\n    $$\n    R(t) = R_S(t) + 0 = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{r(t)^2}\n    $$\n    Substituting the expression for $r(t)^2$:\n    $$\n    R(t) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{-2(n-2)t} = -\\frac{n-1}{2t}\n    $$\n    The time derivative is:\n    $$\n    \\partial_{t} R = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(-\\frac{n-1}{2} t^{-1}\\right) = -\\frac{n-1}{2} (-1) t^{-2} = \\frac{n-1}{2t^2}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Gradient term $2\\langle \\nabla R, V \\rangle$**: The scalar curvature $R(t) = -\\frac{n-1}{2t}$ is a function of time only and is spatially constant. Its spatial gradient $\\nabla R$ is therefore identically zero. This implies:\n    $$\n    2\\langle \\nabla R, V \\rangle = 0\n    $$\n\n3.  **Ricci term $2\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V)$**: We have $V=\\partial_z$. We need to evaluate $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\partial_z, \\partial_z)$. As derived earlier, the Ricci tensor of the product metric is $\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = (n-2)g_{S^{n-1}}$. This tensor has components only in the directions tangent to the $S^{n-1}$ factor. The component in the direction of the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor is zero. This is also stated as fact (ii) in the problem. Hence:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Ric}(V,V) = \\operatorname{Ric}(\\partial_z, \\partial_z) = 0\n    $$\n    Therefore, the term $2\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V)$ is also zero.\n\nCombining these terms, the Harnack quantity is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}(V) = \\partial_{t} R + 2 \\langle \\nabla R, V \\rangle + 2 \\operatorname{Ric}(V,V) = \\frac{n-1}{2t^2} + 0 + 0 = \\frac{n-1}{2t^2}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for $\\mathcal{H}(V)$.\n\nFinally, we address the question of sharpness. Hamilton's trace Harnack inequality states that for a Ricci flow on a manifold with a non-negative curvature operator, $\\mathcal{H}(V) \\ge 0$. The product manifold $S^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ has a non-negative curvature operator for $n \\ge 3$, so the inequality applies. The inequality is said to be \"sharp\" if equality holds, i.e., if $\\mathcal{H}(V) = 0$ for some non-zero vector $V$.\nFor the vector $V$ tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor, we found $\\mathcal{H}(V) = \\frac{n-1}{2t^2}$. Since we assume $n \\ge 3$ and consider $t0$, we have $n-1 > 0$ and $t^2 > 0$. Thus, $\\mathcal{H}(V)$ is strictly positive.\nBecause $\\mathcal{H}(V) > 0$, the Harnack inequality is not an equality. We conclude that for this ancient solution, the trace Harnack inequality is not sharp along directions tangent to the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n-1}{2t^2}}$$", "id": "3029427"}]}
