First, we must compute the Laplacian of the squared norm of its differential, $\\Delta_g(|du|^2)$. Second, we must justify why the target curvature term in the associated Bochner identity vanishes.\n\nLet the source manifold be the $m$-dimensional flat torus $(T^m, g)$, where $T^m = \\mathbb{R}^m / \\mathbb{Z}^m$ and $g$ is the standard flat metric induced from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^m$. In the standard coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^m)$, the metric tensor is given by $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, and its inverse is $g^{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nLet the target manifold be the $n$-dimensional flat torus $(T^n, h)$, where $T^n = \\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $h$ is the standard flat metric induced from the Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. In the standard coordinates $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$, the metric tensor is given by $h_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$.\n\nThe map $u: T^m \\to T^n$ is induced by the affine map $u(x) = Ax + b$ on the universal covers, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, $A \\in \\operatorname{Mat}_{n \\times m}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a matrix with integer entries, and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a constant vector. The components of the map are $u^\\alpha(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^m A_{\\alpha i} x^i + b^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nFirst, we compute $\\Delta_g(|du|^2)$. We begin by calculating the differential $du$ and its squared norm $|du|^2$.\nThe differential $du$ is a section of the bundle $T^*T^m \\otimes u^*(TT^n)$. In the standard local coordinates, its components are given by the partial derivatives of the map $u$:\n$$ (du)_i^\\alpha = \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i} $$\nFor the given affine map, we have:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^m A_{\\alpha j} x^j + b^\\alpha \\right) = A_{\\alpha i} $$\nThe components of the differential are the constant entries of the matrix $A$.\n\nThe pointwise Hilbert-Schmidt norm squared of the differential, $|du|^2$, is defined as the trace of the pullback of the target metric, which in local coordinates is given by:\n$$ |du|^2 = g^{ij} h_{\\alpha\\beta} \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial u^\\beta}{\\partial x^j} $$\nUsing the summation convention, we substitute the components of our metrics and differential:\n$$ |du|^2 = \\delta_{ij} \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta} (A_{\\alpha i}) (A_{\\beta j}) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n (A_{\\alpha i})^2 $$\nThis expression is the sum of the squares of all the entries of the matrix $A$. It is a constant value, independent of the point $x \\in T^m$. Let us denote this constant by $C = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n (A_{\\alpha i})^2$.\n\nNext, we compute the action of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_g$ on the function $|du|^2=C$. The Laplace-Beltrami operator on a function $f$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is given in local coordinates by:\n$$ \\Delta_g f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j} \\right) $$\nFor the flat torus $(T^m, g)$, we have $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, so $\\det(g) = 1$ and $g^{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. The formula simplifies to the standard Euclidean Laplacian:\n$$ \\Delta_g f = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{(\\partial x^i)^2} $$\nWe apply this operator to the function $|du|^2 = C$. Since $C$ is a constant, its partial derivatives of any order are zero.\n$$ \\Delta_g(|du|^2) = \\Delta_g(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{(\\partial x^i)^2} = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}(0) = 0 $$\nThus, the first part of the problem yields the result $\\Delta_g(|du|^2) = 0$.\n\nSecond, we must justify from first principles why the curvature contribution from the target manifold $T^n$ vanishes in the Bochner identity. The Bochner identity for a harmonic map $u: (M,g) \\to (N,h)$ relates the Laplacian of the energy density to several terms, including one that depends on the Riemann curvature tensor of the target manifold, $R^N$. This term is typically of the form $-\\operatorname{tr}_g \\langle R^N(du(\\cdot), du(\\cdot))du(\\cdot), du(\\cdot) \\rangle_h$. For this term to vanish, it is sufficient that the Riemann curvature tensor $R^N$ is identically zero.\n\nWe will show that $(T^n,h)$ is a flat manifold, i.e., $R^N \\equiv 0$.\nThe components of the Riemann curvature tensor are given in local coordinates by:\n$$ R^\\delta_{\\ \\alpha\\beta\\gamma} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^\\delta_{\\alpha\\gamma}}{\\partial y^\\beta} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial y^\\gamma} + \\Gamma^\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\gamma} \\Gamma^\\delta_{\\epsilon\\beta} - \\Gamma^\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta} \\Gamma^\\delta_{\\epsilon\\gamma} $$\nwhere $\\Gamma^\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection associated with the metric $h$. The Christoffel symbols are defined by:\n$$ \\Gamma^\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2} h^{\\gamma\\delta} \\left( \\frac{\\partial h_{\\delta\\alpha}}{\\partial y^\\beta} + \\frac{\\partial h_{\\delta\\beta}}{\\partial y^\\alpha} - \\frac{\\partial h_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial y^\\delta} \\right) $$\nThe target manifold is the flat torus $T^n$ with the standard metric $h = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^n dy_\\alpha^2$. In the standard coordinate system $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$, the components of the metric tensor are constant: $h_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$.\nConsequently, all partial derivatives of the metric components are zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h_{\\alpha\\beta}}{\\partial y^\\gamma} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\} $$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, we find that they are all identically zero:\n$$ \\Gamma^\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\frac{1}{2} h^{\\gamma\\delta} (0 + 0 - 0) = 0 $$\nNow, substituting $\\Gamma^\\gamma_{\\alpha\\beta} = 0$ into the formula for the Riemann curvature tensor, all terms vanish:\n$$ R^\\delta_{\\ \\alpha\\beta\\gamma} = 0 - 0 + 0 - 0 = 0 $$\nSince all components of the Riemann curvature tensor of the target manifold $(T^n, h)$ are zero, the tensor itself is identically zero ($R^N \\equiv 0$). A manifold with a zero Riemann curvature tensor is called a flat manifold. Any expression constructed from this tensor, such as the target curvature term in the Bochner identity, must therefore be zero.

A key consequence is that their Christoffel symbols are zero in standard Cartesian coordinates. Let $F: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3$ be a lift of the map $f$ to the universal covers. The harmonic map equation simplifies dramatically to:\n$$ \\Delta F^\\gamma = 0 \\quad \\text{for } \\gamma = 1, 2, 3 $$\nThis means each component of the lift $F$ must be a harmonic function on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe homotopy class of $f$ is determined by the matrix $A$.

A general harmonic function on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can have logarithmic growth, but the quasi-periodicity constraint restricts the form of the solution.
