We can proceed with a solution.\n\nThe goal is to find the singular extinction time $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ for a solution to the unnormalized Ricci flow on a closed Einstein manifold with positive Einstein constant. The solution is assumed to take the homogeneous form $g(t)=\\rho(t)\\,g_{0}$, where $g_{0}$ is the initial metric.\n\nThe Ricci flow equation is given by\n$$ \\partial_{t} g(t)=-2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}\\left(g(t)\\right) $$\nThe initial condition is $g(0)=g_{0}$, and the ansatz for the solution is $g(t)=\\rho(t)\\,g_{0}$ for some scalar function of time $\\rho(t)$.\n\nFirst, we substitute the ansatz into the left-hand side (LHS) of the Ricci flow equation. Since $g_{0}$ is a fixed metric tensor field independent of time, the time derivative only acts on the scalar factor $\\rho(t)$.\n$$ \\text{LHS} = \\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left(\\rho(t)\\,g_{0}\\right) = \\left(\\partial_{t}\\rho(t)\\right)g_{0} $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation. This requires understanding how the Ricci tensor behaves under a constant scaling of the metric. Let $\\tilde{g} = c\\,g$ where $c$ is a positive constant. We need to relate $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\tilde{g})$ to $\\operatorname{Ric}(g)$. In local coordinates, the components of the metric tensors are related by $\\tilde{g}_{ij} = c\\,g_{ij}$, and the components of their inverses are related by $\\tilde{g}^{ij} = c^{-1}g^{ij}$. The Christoffel symbols of the connection are given by\n$$ \\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^{k} = \\frac{1}{2}\\tilde{g}^{kl}\\left(\\partial_{i}\\tilde{g}_{jl} + \\partial_{j}\\tilde{g}_{il} - \\partial_{l}\\tilde{g}_{ij}\\right) $$\nSince $c$ is a constant, its partial derivatives are zero. Substituting $\\tilde{g}_{ij} = c\\,g_{ij}$ yields:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^{k} = \\frac{1}{2}c^{-1}g^{kl}\\left(c\\,\\partial_{i}g_{jl} + c\\,\\partial_{j}g_{il} - c\\,\\partial_{l}g_{ij}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}g^{kl}\\left(\\partial_{i}g_{jl} + \\partial_{j}g_{il} - \\partial_{l}g_{ij}\\right) = \\Gamma_{ij}^{k} $$\nThe Christoffel symbols are invariant under constant scaling of the metric. The components of the Riemann curvature tensor of type $(1,3)$ are defined in terms of the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives:\n$$ \\tilde{R}_{ijk}^{l} = \\partial_{j}\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ik}^{l} - \\partial_{i}\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{jk}^{l} + \\tilde{\\Gamma}_{jp}^{l}\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ik}^{p} - \\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ip}^{l}\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{jk}^{p} $$\nSince $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^{k} = \\Gamma_{ij}^{k}$, it follows immediately that the components are also invariant: $\\tilde{R}_{ijk}^{l} = R_{ijk}^{l}$.\nThe Ricci tensor components are obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor: $\\tilde{R}_{ik} = \\tilde{R}_{ijk}^{j}$. As the Riemann tensor components are invariant, so are the Ricci tensor components:\n$$ \\tilde{R}_{ik} = R_{ijk}^{j} = R_{ik} $$\nThis means that in any coordinate system, the components of $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\tilde{g})$ are identical to the components of $\\operatorname{Ric}(g)$. This implies that the tensor fields themselves are equal: $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\tilde{g}) = \\operatorname{Ric}(g)$.\n\nApplying this result to our problem, for any fixed time $t$, the scalar factor $\\rho(t)$ is a constant with respect to spatial variables. Thus, we have the relation:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\operatorname{Ric}\\left(\\rho(t)\\,g_{0}\\right) = \\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0}) $$\nNow we can write the RHS of the Ricci flow equation as:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = -2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = -2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0}) $$\nThe problem states that the initial metric $g_0$ is Einstein with a positive Einstein constant $\\lambda > 0$, meaning it satisfies the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}(g_{0}) = \\lambda g_{0}$. Substituting this into the RHS gives:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = -2\\,\\left(\\lambda g_{0}\\right) = (-2\\lambda) g_{0} $$\nNow we equate the LHS and RHS:\n$$ \\left(\\partial_{t}\\rho(t)\\right)g_{0} = (-2\\lambda) g_{0} $$\nSince $g_{0}$ is a metric, it is a non-degenerate tensor field. Therefore, we can equate the scalar coefficients, which yields the ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $\\rho(t)$:\n$$ \\partial_{t}\\rho(t) = -2\\lambda $$\nTo solve this ODE, we need an initial condition for $\\rho(t)$. From the problem statement, $g(0) = g_{0}$. From the ansatz, $g(0) = \\rho(0)g_{0}$. Comparing these two, we find $\\rho(0)g_{0} = g_{0}$, which implies $\\rho(0)=1$.\n\nWe now solve the initial value problem:\n$$ \\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = -2\\lambda, \\quad \\rho(0)=1 $$\nIntegrating the ODE with respect to $t$ gives:\n$$ \\rho(t) = \\int (-2\\lambda) dt = -2\\lambda t + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Using the initial condition $\\rho(0)=1$:\n$$ \\rho(0) = -2\\lambda(0) + C = 1 \\implies C=1 $$\nSo, the solution for the scale factor is:\n$$ \\rho(t) = 1 - 2\\lambda t $$\nThe singular (extinction) time $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is the time at which the metric becomes singular. For the ansatz $g(t) = \\rho(t)g_{0}$, this corresponds to the time when the scaling factor $\\rho(t)$ becomes zero, causing the manifold to collapse homothetically to a point (i.e., its volume vanishes). We find $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ by setting $\\rho(T_{\\mathrm{ext}}) = 0$:\n$$ 1 - 2\\lambda T_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0 $$\nSolving for $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, we get:\n$$ 2\\lambda T_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 1 $$\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} $$\nSince we are given that $\\lambda > 0$, the extinction time $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is a positive and finite value, which is characteristic for Ricci flow on manifolds with positive Ricci curvature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2\\lambda}}$$", "id": "3033472"}, {"introduction": "Understanding that singularities form is only the first step; classifying their nature is a central goal in the study of Ricci flow.
