Qualitative Prediction and Final Ratio**\n\nThe IMCF speed is inversely proportional to the mean curvature, $v=1/H$. Regions with lower mean curvature (which are \"flatter\") will move outward faster than regions with higher mean curvature (which are \"sharper\"). The flow tends to make the surface more spherical over time.\n- To compare the speeds $v(p)$ and $v(q)$, we compare the mean curvatures $H(p)$ and $H(q)$.\n- The region near the pole $p=(0,0,c)$ moves faster if $v(p) > v(q)$, which is equivalent to $H(p) < H(q)$. This inequality is $c\\left(\\frac{1}{a^2} + \\frac{1}{b^2}\\right) < a\\left(\\frac{1}{b^2} + \\frac{1}{c^2}\\right)$. The outcome depends on the relative values of $a,b,c$.\n- For a prolate (cigar-shaped) ellipsoid with $c > a=b$, the pole $p$ is a \"sharp\" point with high curvature, so $H(p)$ is large and $v(p)$ is small. The equator is \"fatter\", has lower curvature, and hence moves faster.\n- For an oblate (pancake-shaped) ellipsoid with $c < a=b$, the pole $p$ is on a \"flat\" region with low curvature, so $H(p)$ is small and $v(p)$ is large. The equator is \"sharper\", has higher curvature, and moves slower.\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio of the initial IMCF speeds:\n$$ \\frac{v(p)}{v(q)} = \\frac{\\frac{a^2b^2}{c(a^2+b^2)}}{\\frac{b^2c^2}{a(b^2+c^2)}} = \\frac{a^2b^2}{c(a^2+b^2)} \\cdot \\frac{a(b^2+c^2)}{b^2c^2} $$\nSimplifying by canceling the $b^2$ term:\n$$ \\frac{v(p)}{v(q)} = \\frac{a^3(b^2+c^2)}{c^3(a^2+b^2)} $$\nThis expression gives the ratio of the initial expansion speeds under IMCF at the specified pole and equatorial point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{a^{3}(b^{2}+c^{2})}{c^{3}(a^{2}+b^{2})}}$$", "id": "3031194"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates the qualitative intuition gained from the ellipsoid example into a rigorous quantitative analysis.

The dot product is $X \\cdot \\nu \\approx R(1+u)\\theta \\cdot (\\theta - \\nabla_{S^{n-1}}u) = R(1+u)$, since $\\theta$ is orthogonal to tangent vectors like $\\nabla_{S^{n-1}}u$. So, to first order, the rescaling term is $\\frac{X \\cdot \\nu}{R} \\approx \\frac{R(1+u)}{R} = 1+u$.\n\nCombining the linearized terms into the evolution equation for $u$:\n$$ \\partial_{\\tau} u = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n-1}\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}u + u\\right) - (1+u) $$\n$$ \\partial_{\\tau} u = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}u $$\nThis is the linearized evolution equation for the normalized perturbation.\n\n**3. Spectral Analysis and Decay Rate**\n\nWe decompose the perturbation $u(\\theta, \\tau)$ into spherical harmonics $Y_{\\ell}(\\theta)$, which are eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{n-1}$. For a single mode of degree $\\ell$, we write $u(\\theta,\\tau) = c_{\\ell}(\\tau)Y_{\\ell}(\\theta)$. The eigenvalue equation is $\\Delta_{S^{n-1}} Y_{\\ell} = -\\ell(\\ell+n-2)Y_{\\ell}$.\n\nSubstituting the single mode into the linearized PDE:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}\\left(c_{\\ell}(\\tau)Y_{\\ell}(\\theta)\\right) = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}\\left(c_{\\ell}(\\tau)Y_{\\ell}(\\theta)\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{dc_{\\ell}}{d\\tau} Y_{\\ell}(\\theta) = \\frac{c_{\\ell}(\\tau)}{n-1} \\left(-\\ell(\\ell+n-2)Y_{\\ell}(\\theta)\\right) $$\nThis yields an ODE for the amplitude $c_{\\ell}(\\tau)$:\n$$ \\frac{dc_{\\ell}}{d\\tau} = -\\frac{\\ell(\\ell+n-2)}{n-1} c_{\\ell}(\\tau) $$\nThe solution is $c_{\\ell}(\\tau) = c_{\\ell}(0)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ell(\\ell+n-2)}{n-1}\\tau\\right)$.\n\nThe exponential decay rate $\\lambda_{\\ell}$ is the coefficient of $\\tau$ in the exponent. Therefore:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\ell} = \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+n-2)}{n-1} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\ell(\\ell+n-2)}{n-1}}$$", "id": "3031203"}]}
