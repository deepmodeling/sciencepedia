The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the extinction time $T$ of a round $n$-sphere $S^{n}$ evolving under Mean Curvature Flow (MCF) in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The initial sphere at time $t=0$ has radius $R(0) = R_{0}$.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the sphere and the isotropic nature of the mean curvature, the evolving hypersurface $M_{t}$ remains a sphere for all $t \\in [0, T)$. Let its radius at time $t$ be $R(t)$. We can place the center of the sphere at the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ without loss of generality.\n\nA point on the sphere at time $t$ is represented by a position vector $x(t)$. The length of this vector is the radius of the sphere: $|x(t)| = R(t)$. The outward unit normal vector $\\nu(t)$ at the point $x(t)$ is given by $\\nu(t) = \\frac{x(t)}{|x(t)|} = \\frac{x(t)}{R(t)}$.\n\nThe problem provides the evolution law for MCF:\n$$ \\partial_{t} x = -H \\nu $$\nWe are also given that the mean curvature $H$ of a sphere of radius $R(t)$ is:\n$$ H = \\frac{n}{R(t)} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $H$ and $\\nu$ into the MCF equation, we get:\n$$ \\partial_{t} x = -\\left(\\frac{n}{R(t)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{x}{R(t)}\\right) = -\\frac{n}{R(t)^{2}} x $$\nNow, consider the time derivative of the position vector $x(t)$ from another perspective. The direction of a point on the shrinking sphere remains constant, so we can write $x(t) = R(t) \\hat{u}$, where $\\hat{u}$ is a constant unit vector. Differentiating with respect to time $t$ gives:\n$$ \\partial_{t} x = \\frac{d}{dt}(R(t) \\hat{u}) = \\frac{dR}{dt} \\hat{u} $$\nSince $\\hat{u} = \\frac{x(t)}{R(t)}$, we can write:\n$$ \\partial_{t} x = \\left(\\frac{dR}{dt}\\right) \\frac{x}{R(t)} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\partial_{t} x$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{dR}{dt}\\right) \\frac{x}{R(t)} = -\\frac{n}{R(t)^{2}} x $$\nFor any point $x \\neq 0$ on the sphere, we can cancel the vector $x$ and one factor of $R(t)^{-1}$ from both sides, which yields an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the radius $R(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{n}{R} $$\nThis is a separable ODE. We can rewrite it as:\n$$ R \\, dR = -n \\, dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$. The corresponding radius evolves from its initial value $R(0) = R_{0}$ to $R(t)$.\n$$ \\int_{R_{0}}^{R(t)} R' \\, dR' = \\int_{0}^{t} -n \\, dt' $$\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{(R')^{2}}{2} \\right]_{R_{0}}^{R(t)} = [-nt']_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\frac{R(t)^{2}}{2} - \\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{2} = -n(t - 0) $$\n$$ R(t)^{2} - R_{0}^{2} = -2nt $$\nSolving for $R(t)^{2}$:\n$$ R(t)^{2} = R_{0}^{2} - 2nt $$\nThus, the radius of the sphere at time $t$ is:\n$$ R(t) = \\sqrt{R_{0}^{2} - 2nt} $$\nThe flow develops a singularity and becomes extinct at the time $T$ when the radius collapses to zero, i.e., $R(T) = 0$. We set $R(T) = 0$ in the equation for the radius:\n$$ 0 = \\sqrt{R_{0}^{2} - 2nT} $$\nSquaring both sides and solving for $T$:\n$$ 0 = R_{0}^{2} - 2nT $$\n$$ 2nT = R_{0}^{2} $$\n$$ T = \\frac{R_{0}^{2}}{2n} $$\nThis is the extinction time for the sphere under Mean Curvature Flow.

The two principal curvatures at any point on this surface are the meridional curvature, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mer}}$, and the azimuthal curvature, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{azi}}$.\n\nFor a curve in the $rz$-plane given by $r(z)$, the meridional curvature is the curvature of this generating curve.

The sign is chosen such that the curvature of a convex profile (like a sphere) is positive.\n\nThe azimuthal curvature is the curvature of the circle of latitude at a given $z$. This circle has radius $r(z,t)$ and lies in a plane orthogonal to the $z$-axis. Its curvature, projected onto the surface normal, is given by:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{azi}}(z,t) = \\frac{1}{r \\left(1 + r_{z}^{2}\\right)^{1/2}}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the mean curvature $H$ is the sum of the principal curvatures:\n$$\nH(z,t) = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{mer}}(z,t) + \\kappa_{\\mathrm{azi}}(z,t) = \\frac{-r_{zz}}{\\left(1 + r_{z}^{2}\\right)^{3/2}} + \\frac{1}{r \\left(1 + r_{z}^{2}\\right)^{1/2}}\n$$\n\nThe surface evolves by Mean Curvature Flow, $\\partial_{t} X = -H \\nu$, where $\\nu$ is the outward unit normal vector.

To find the governing equation for $a(t)$, we evaluate the PDE at $z=0$. The problem states that the neck at $z=0$ is a point of symmetry, which implies that the tangent to the generating curve is horizontal at the neck for all times $t$ before the pinch. Mathematically, this means $r_{z}(0,t) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting $z=0$ and $r_z(0,t)=0$ into the evolution PDE, we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{d a(t)}{d t} = \\frac{r_{zz}(0,t)}{1 + 0^{2}} - \\frac{1}{r(0,t)}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d a}{d t} = r_{zz}(0,t) - \\frac{1}{a(t)}\n$$\nThis is an exact equation, but it is not yet a closed ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $a(t)$ because of the term $r_{zz}(0,t)$, which describes the axial curvature of the neck.\n\nHere, we apply the slender-neck assumption. We are given a length scale $L$ such that at $t=0$, $r_{zz}(0,0) \\sim L^{-1}$ and $r_0 \\ll L$. This implies that the initial meridional curvature at the neck, $r_{zz}(0,0)$, is much smaller in magnitude than the initial azimuthal curvature, $1/r(0,0)=1/r_0$, since $L^{-1} \\ll r_{0}^{-1}$.\nIt is a standard result in the analysis of MCF that for such a slender neck, the neck profile evolves much more slowly than the neck radius contracts. As $a(t)$ decreases, the azimuthal curvature term $-1/a(t)$ grows and becomes even more dominant over the meridional curvature term $r_{zz}(0,t)$, which is assumed to remain bounded. Therefore, to leading order, the evolution of the neck is governed by the azimuthal curvature alone. This is equivalent to modeling the neck locally as a shrinking cylinder.\n\nThe leading-order ODE for $a(t)$ is thus obtained by neglecting the $r_{zz}(0,t)$ term:\n$$\n\\frac{d a}{d t} = -\\frac{1}{a}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ODE.

We will use singular homology with integer coefficients, $H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, and the Betti numbers are defined as $b_k(X) = \\mathrm{rank}(H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Betti numbers of the initial surface, $M_{0}$.\nThe problem states that $M_{0}$ is a smooth, compact, embedded surface in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ which is diffeomorphic to the $2$-sphere, $S^{2}$. A diffeomorphism is a homotopy equivalence, and singular homology is a homotopy invariant.

The initial surface $M_{0}$ is a single connected object, so $b_0(M_0)=1$. The surgery procedure severs the connection between the two caps, resulting in two disjoint surfaces. Thus, $M_{T}^{\\mathrm{surg}}$ has two connected components, and $b_0(M_T^{\\mathrm{surg}})=2$. The change $\\Delta b_{0} = 1$ directly reflects this splitting of one component into two by eliminating the connecting neck.\n- The Betti number $b_{1}$ counts the number of independent, non-bounding $1$-cycles (topological \"holes\" or \"handles\"). The initial surface $M_0 \\cong S^2$ is simply connected and has no such holes, so $b_1(M_0)=0$. The final components are also spheres, which are simply connected, so $b_1(M_T^{\\mathrm{surg}})=0$. The surgery does not create any handles, so $\\Delta b_1=0$.\n- The Betti number $b_{2}$ for a closed, orientable surface in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ counts the number of enclosed volumes or \"voids\". The initial surface $M_{0}$ encloses a single volume, so $b_2(M_0)=1$. The post-surgery surface consists of two disjoint spheres, each enclosing its own separate volume. Thus, there are two enclosed voids, and $b_2(M_T^{\\mathrm{surg}})=2$. The change $\\Delta b_{2}=1$ corresponds to the creation of a second, distinct enclosed region as a consequence of the surface splitting into two.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3033531"}]}
