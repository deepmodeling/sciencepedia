It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of mean curvature flow, well-posed with a clear initial condition and symmetry assumption, and formulated with objective, precise mathematical language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the evolution equation for the radius of a sphere under mean curvature flow, its solution, the extinction time, and a verification of consistency with the Brakke formulation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Ordinary Differential Equation for $R(t)$**\n\nThe evolution of the hypersurface is described by the level set equation:\n$$\n\\phi_{t} = |\\nabla \\phi|\\,\\mathrm{div}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\phi}{|\\nabla \\phi|}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\phi(x,t)=0$ defines the hypersurface at time $t$. The normal velocity of the interface in the direction of the normal $\\nu = \\frac{\\nabla\\phi}{|\\nabla\\phi|}$ is $v_n = -\\frac{\\phi_t}{|\\nabla\\phi|}$. The mean curvature of the level set is given by $H_{\\text{level}} = \\mathrm{div}(\\frac{\\nabla\\phi}{|\\nabla\\phi|})$. Thus, the level set equation implies $v_n = -H_{\\text{level}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the normal velocity equals the mean curvature. This implies a specific choice of sign convention for the mean curvature. Let us define the mean curvature $H$ of a hypersurface to be positive for convex shapes like spheres, using the inward normal. Let the hypersurface be given by a level set $F(x)=0$. With the inward unit normal $\\nu_{\\text{in}}$, the mean curvature is $H = -\\mathrm{div}(\\nu_{\\text{in}})$. If we choose $F$ such that $\\nabla F$ points inward, then $\\nu_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{\\nabla F}{|\\nabla F|}$, and $H = -\\mathrm{div}(\\frac{\\nabla F}{|\\nabla F|})$. The condition \"normal velocity equals mean curvature\" means the surface moves inward with speed $H$. For a shrinking sphere of radius $R(t)$, the inward speed is $-\\frac{dR}{dt}$. Thus, we must have $-\\frac{dR}{dt}=H$.\n\nLet us define the level set function $\\phi(x,t)$ to be consistent with this convention. We choose a function whose gradient points inward, for example:\n$$\n\\phi(x, t) = R(t) - |x|\n$$\nwhere $|x|$ denotes the Euclidean norm in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The zero level set $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : \\phi(x,t)=0\\}$ is precisely the sphere $S^n(R(t))$ of radius $R(t)$. Let $r = |x|$.\n\nWe compute the terms of the level set PDE for this choice of $\\phi$:\nThe partial derivative with respect to time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\phi_t = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(R(t) - r) = \\frac{dR}{dt}\n$$\nThe spatial gradient $\\nabla \\phi$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla\\phi = \\nabla(R(t) - |x|) = -\\nabla|x| = -\\frac{x}{|x|}\n$$\nThis vector field points radially inward. Its magnitude is:\n$$\n|\\nabla\\phi| = \\left|-\\frac{x}{|x|}\\right| = 1 \\quad (\\text{for } x \\neq 0)\n$$\nThe unit normal vector is $\\frac{\\nabla\\phi}{|\\nabla\\phi|} = -\\frac{x}{|x|}$.\nThe divergence term in the PDE is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{div}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\nabla \\phi}{|\\nabla \\phi|}\\right) = \\mathrm{div}\\!\\left(-\\frac{x}{|x|}\\right) = -\\mathrm{div}\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{r}\\right)\n$$\nThe divergence of the radial unit vector field $\\frac{x}{r}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is a standard result:\n$$\n\\mathrm{div}\\!\\left(\\frac{x}{r}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} \\left(\\frac{x_i}{r}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \\left(\\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{x_i^2}{r^3}\\right) = \\frac{n+1}{r} - \\frac{\\sum x_i^2}{r^3} = \\frac{n+1}{r} - \\frac{r^2}{r^3} = \\frac{n}{r}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the level set equation:\n$$\n\\phi_t = |\\nabla\\phi| \\mathrm{div}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\nabla\\phi}{|\\nabla\\phi|}\\right) \\implies \\frac{dR}{dt} = (1) \\left(-\\frac{n}{r}\\right) = -\\frac{n}{r}\n$$\nThis equation must hold on the zero level set, where $r = |x| = R(t)$. Thus, we obtain the ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the evolution of the radius $R(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{n}{R(t)}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Solution of the ODE and Determination of the Extinction Time**\n\nThe derived ODE is a separable first-order differential equation:\n$$\nR(t)\\frac{dR}{dt} = -n\n$$\nWe integrate both sides with respect to $t$. Let the integration run from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} R(t')\\frac{dR}{dt'} dt' = \\int_{0}^{t} -n \\, dt'\n$$\nThe left side can be evaluated by a change of variables to $R$:\n$$\n\\int_{R(0)}^{R(t)} R \\, dR = [-nt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{1}{2}R^2\\right]_{R_0}^{R(t)} = -nt\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}R(t)^2 - \\frac{1}{2}R_0^2 = -nt\n$$\nSolving for $R(t)^2$:\n$$\nR(t)^2 = R_0^2 - 2nt\n$$\nSince the radius must be non-negative, we take the positive square root:\n$$\nR(t) = \\sqrt{R_0^2 - 2nt}\n$$\nThis solution is valid for $t \\ge 0$ as long as the term inside the square root is non-negative.\n\nThe extinction time, $T$, is the time at which the radius shrinks to zero, i.e., $R(T)=0$.\n$$\n0 = \\sqrt{R_0^2 - 2nT}\n$$\n$$\nR_0^2 - 2nT = 0\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{R_0^2}{2n}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Verification with the Brakke Formulation**\n\nThe Brakke formulation of mean curvature flow provides a weak definition of the flow for rectifiable varifolds. For a smooth evolution, the Brakke inequality becomes an equality relating the rate of change of area to the integral of the squared mean curvature. In its differential form, for a test function $\\varphi$ defined on the evolving surface $S_t$, this relationship is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{S_t} \\varphi \\, d\\mathcal{H}^n = \\int_{S_t} \\left( \\Delta_{S_t}\\varphi - \\varphi|\\vec{H}|^2 + \\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial t} \\right) d\\mathcal{H}^n\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{S_t}$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S_t$ and $\\vec{H}$ is the mean curvature vector.\n\nThe problem asks to verify this for the constant test function $\\varphi(x,t) \\equiv 1$. For this choice, $\\Delta_{S_t}\\varphi = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial t} = 0$. The equality simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\int_{S_t} 1 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^n = -\\int_{S_t} |\\vec{H}|^2 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^n\n$$\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is the rate of change of the area of the surface. The area of an $n$-sphere of radius $R(t)$ is $A(t) = \\omega_n R(t)^n$, where $\\omega_n$ is the area of the unit $n$-sphere.\n$$\n\\text{LHS} = \\frac{d}{dt}A(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\omega_n R(t)^n) = \\omega_n n R(t)^{n-1} \\frac{dR}{dt}\n$$\nUsing our result from the level set formulation, $\\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{n}{R(t)}$:\n$$\n\\text{LHS} = \\omega_n n R(t)^{n-1} \\left(-\\frac{n}{R(t)}\\right) = -n^2 \\omega_n R(t)^{n-2}\n$$\nThe right-hand side (RHS) involves the scalar mean curvature $H = |\\vec{H}|$. For a sphere of radius $R(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, the mean curvature is constant across the surface and is given by $H = \\frac{n}{R(t)}$.\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = -\\int_{S^n(R(t))} \\left(\\frac{n}{R(t)}\\right)^2 d\\mathcal{H}^n = -\\left(\\frac{n}{R(t)}\\right)^2 \\int_{S^n(R(t))} 1 \\, d\\mathcal{H}^n\n$$\n$$\n\\text{RHS} = -\\frac{n^2}{R(t)^2} A(t) = -\\frac{n^2}{R(t)^2} \\left(\\omega_n R(t)^n\\right) = -n^2 \\omega_n R(t)^{n-2}\n$$\nWe see that LHS = RHS. This confirms that the evolution $R(t)=\\sqrt{R_0^2-2nt}$ gives an evolution by mean curvature that is a \"strong\" Brakke flow, for which the inequality becomes an equality. The right-hand side, $-n^2 \\omega_n R(t)^{n-2}$, is indeed expressed in terms of $R(t)$ and the mean curvature $H(t) = \\frac{n}{R(t)}$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the expression for $R(t)$ and the extinction time $T$.\n$$\nR(t) = \\sqrt{R_0^2 - 2nt}\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{R_0^2}{2n}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sqrt{R_0^2 - 2nt} & \\frac{R_0^2}{2n}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3031786"}, {"introduction": "While many surfaces shrink to a point under mean curvature flow, a special class of solutions evolves by simply rescaling in time.

We need to express the derivatives of $u$ with respect to $x$ and $t$ in terms of derivatives of $w$ with respect to $z$ and properties of the distance function $d$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the time derivative of $u$:\n$$\nu_t = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} w(z) = \\frac{dw}{dz} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = w'(z) \\frac{d_t}{\\varepsilon}.\n$$\nThe quantity $-d_t$ represents the normal velocity of the level set of $d$ passing through point $x$. Near the interface $\\Gamma(t)$ (where $d=0$), this velocity is approximately the interface velocity $v_n$. By convention, $v_n = -d_t$. Thus,\n$$\nu_t = -w'(z) \\frac{v_n}{\\varepsilon}.\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the spatial derivatives. The gradient of $u$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla u = \\nabla w(z) = w'(z) \\nabla z = w'(z) \\frac{\\nabla d}{\\varepsilon}.\n$$\nThe Laplacian of $u$ is found by taking the divergence of the gradient:\n$$\n\\Delta u = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla u) = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( w'(z) \\frac{\\nabla d}{\\varepsilon} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left( (\\nabla w'(z)) \\cdot \\nabla d + w'(z) (\\Delta d) \\right).\n$$\nThe gradient of $w'(z)$ is $\\nabla w'(z) = w''(z)\\nabla z = w''(z)\\frac{\\nabla d}{\\varepsilon}$. Substituting this in, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta u = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left( \\left( w''(z)\\frac{\\nabla d}{\\varepsilon} \\right) \\cdot \\nabla d + w'(z) (\\Delta d) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2} w''(z) |\\nabla d|^2 + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} w'(z) \\Delta d.\n$$\nWe use the fundamental properties of the signed distance function $d(x,t)$: in a tubular neighborhood of the interface $\\Gamma(t)$, $|\\nabla d|=1$. Also, for points $x$ close to $\\Gamma(t)$ (i.e., for small $d$), the Laplacian $\\Delta d$ is well-approximated by the mean curvature $\\kappa$ of the interface. Specifically, $\\Delta d(x) = \\kappa(p(x)) + O(d)$, where $p(x)$ is the projection of $x$ onto $\\Gamma(t)$. Since the transition layer has thickness $O(\\varepsilon)$, we have $d = \\varepsilon z$, so the approximation $\\Delta d \\approx \\kappa$ is valid at the order of approximation we are interested in.\nWith these properties, the Laplacian simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta u \\approx \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2} w''(z) + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} w'(z) \\kappa.\n$$\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for $u_t$ and $\\Delta u$ into the Allen-Cahn equation, $u_{t} = \\Delta u - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^{2}}\\,f(u)$:\n$$\n-w'(z) \\frac{v_n}{\\varepsilon} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2} w''(z) + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} w'(z) \\kappa \\right) - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2} f(w(z)).\n$$\nTo analyze this equation, we clear the denominators by multiplying by $\\varepsilon^2$:\n$$\n-\\varepsilon v_n w'(z) = w''(z) + \\varepsilon \\kappa w'(z) - f(w(z)).\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the governing equation for the profile $w(z)$ in the inner layer:\n$$\nw''(z) - f(w(z)) + \\varepsilon (v_n + \\kappa) w'(z) = 0.\n$$\n\nThis is a perturbed ordinary differential equation. We proceed by seeking a solution in the form of a power series in $\\varepsilon$: $w(z) = w_0(z) + \\varepsilon w_1(z) + O(\\varepsilon^2)$.\n\n**1. Leading-order profile $w_0(z)$**\n\nBy collecting terms of order $\\varepsilon^0$, we obtain the leading-order equation for the profile $w_0(z)$:\n$$\nw_0''(z) - f(w_0(z)) = 0.\n$$\nWith $f(u) = u^3 - u$, this is $w_0''(z) - w_0(z)^3 + w_0(z) = 0$. We need to find the heteroclinic solution connecting the stable states $w_0(-\\infty)=-1$ and $w_0(+\\infty)=+1$.\nThis is a conservative system for which the first integral of motion can be found by multiplying by $w_0'$ and integrating with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\int w_0''w_0' dz - \\int (w_0^3-w_0)w_0' dz = C_0.\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(w_0'(z))^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{4}w_0^4 - \\frac{1}{2}w_0^2\\right) = C_0.\n$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is the potential $F(w_0) = \\frac{1}{4}(w_0^2-1)^2$ up to a constant. Specifically, $F(w_0) = \\frac{1}{4}w_0^4 - \\frac{1}{2}w_0^2 + \\frac{1}{4}$. The equation is $\\frac{1}{2}(w_0')^2 - F(w_0) = E$, where $E$ is a constant energy. The boundary conditions are $w_0(\\pm\\infty) = \\pm 1$ and $w_0'(\\pm\\infty)=0$. At $w_0=\\pm 1$, $F(\\pm 1)=0$. Thus, the energy of the heteroclinic orbit must be $E=0$.\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(w_0'(z))^2 = F(w_0) = \\frac{1}{4}(w_0^2-1)^2.\n$$\n$$\nw_0'(z) = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (w_0^2-1).\n$$\nFor a solution to increase from $-1$ to $+1$, we must have $w_0'(z) > 0$. Since $w_0 \\in (-1,1)$ in the transition, $w_0^2-1 < 0$. We must therefore choose the negative sign:\n$$\n\\frac{dw_0}{dz} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (w_0^2-1) = \\frac{1-w_0^2}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dw_0}{1-w_0^2} = \\frac{dz}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n$$\nIntegrating both sides gives $\\text{arctanh}(w_0) = \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}} + C_1$. Setting the interface at $z=0$ to correspond to $w_0(0)=0$ implies the integration constant is $C_1=0$.\nThe unique, odd, increasing heteroclinic solution is:\n$$\nw_0(z) = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right).\n$$\n\n**2. Interfacial velocity $v_n$**\n\nTo find the velocity law, we proceed to the next order in the expansion. We substitute $w(z) = w_0(z) + \\varepsilon w_1(z) + \\dots$ into the full inner equation:\n$$\n(w_0''+\\varepsilon w_1'') - f(w_0+\\varepsilon w_1) + \\varepsilon(v_n+\\kappa)(w_0'+\\varepsilon w_1') = 0.\n$$\nUsing a Taylor expansion for $f(w_0+\\varepsilon w_1) = f(w_0) + \\varepsilon w_1 f'(w_0) + O(\\varepsilon^2)$ and collecting terms of order $\\varepsilon^1$, we get:\n$$\nw_1''(z) - f'(w_0(z)) w_1(z) + (v_n + \\kappa) w_0'(z) = 0.\n$$\nThis is a linear inhomogeneous differential equation for the first-order correction $w_1(z)$. Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the linear operator $\\mathcal{L}[\\phi] = \\phi'' - f'(w_0)\\phi$. The equation for $w_1$ is $\\mathcal{L}[w_1] = -(v_n+\\kappa)w_0'$.\nFor this equation to have a bounded solution for $w_1$, the Fredholm alternative requires the right-hand side to be orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint operator $\\mathcal{L}^\\dagger$. The operator $\\mathcal{L}$ is self-adjoint, so we consider its own null space. To find the null space, we look for solutions to $\\mathcal{L}[\\phi]=0$. Differentiating the leading-order equation $w_0''-f(w_0)=0$ with respect to $z$ yields $w_0''' - f'(w_0)w_0' = 0$, which is exactly $\\mathcal{L}[w_0']=0$. Thus, $w_0'(z)$ is a non-trivial element of the null space of $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\nThe solvability condition is therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( -(v_n + \\kappa) w_0'(z) \\right) w_0'(z) \\, dz = 0.\n$$\n$$\n-(v_n + \\kappa) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (w_0'(z))^2 \\, dz = 0.\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (w_0'(z))^2 dz$ is strictly positive because $w_0'(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\text{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$ is non-negative and not identically zero.\nTherefore, for the equation to hold, the prefactor must be zero:\n$$\nv_n + \\kappa = 0.\n$$\nThis yields the relationship between the normal velocity and the mean curvature:\n$$\nv_n = -\\kappa.\n$$\nThis is the classic Allen-Cahn-to-mean-curvature-flow limit. The negative sign, combined with the stated conventions ($\\kappa>0$ for a sphere, $v_n>0$ for outward motion), correctly implies that convex shapes shrink under the flow.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) & -\\kappa \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3031792"}]}
