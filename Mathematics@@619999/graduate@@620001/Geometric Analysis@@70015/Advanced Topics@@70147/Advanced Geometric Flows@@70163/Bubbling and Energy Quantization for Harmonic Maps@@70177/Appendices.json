We will address these tasks sequentially, building upon the provided definitions and principles.\n\nFirst, we derive a lower bound for the Dirichlet energy $E(u)$ in terms of the topological degree $\\deg(u)$. The energy is defined as\n$$\nE(u) := \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{S^{2}}|du|^{2}\\,dA_{g}.\n$$\nAt each point $x \\in S^2$, the squared Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the differential $du_x$ is given by the sum of the squares of its singular values, $|du|^2 = \\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2$. Substituting this into the energy definition, we have\n$$\nE(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{S^{2}} (\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2) \\,dA_{g}.\n$$\nThe problem provides the elementary inequality $\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2 \\geq 2\\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2}$, which is a direct consequence of $(\\sigma_1 - \\sigma_2)^2 \\ge 0$. Applying this inequality to the integrand, we obtain a lower bound for the energy:\n$$\nE(u) \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{S^{2}} 2\\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2} \\,dA_{g} = \\int_{S^{2}} \\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2} \\,dA_{g}.\n$$\nThe product of the singular values is the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant of the map, $|\\text{Jac}(u)| = \\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2}$. Therefore,\n$$\nE(u) \\geq \\int_{S^{2}} |\\text{Jac}(u)| \\,dA_{g}.\n$$\nNext, we relate this integral to the topological degree of the map $u$. The degree is defined as\n$$\n\\deg(u) := \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int_{S^{2}}u^{*}\\omega,\n$$\nwhere $u^*\\omega$ is the pullback of the area form $\\omega$ from the target $S^2$ to the domain $S^2$. By the definition of the Jacobian, the pullback of the area form relates to the area element of the domain by $u^*\\omega = \\text{Jac}(u) \\, dA_g$. Substituting this into the degree formula gives\n$$\n\\deg(u) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int_{S^{2}} \\text{Jac}(u) \\,dA_{g}.\n$$\nThis implies that the integral of the Jacobian is directly proportional to the degree:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{2}} \\text{Jac}(u) \\,dA_{g} = 4\\pi \\deg(u).\n$$\nWe can now relate the energy to the degree. We use the standard integral inequality $|\\int f| \\leq \\int |f|$, applied to the function $f = \\text{Jac}(u)$:\n$$\n\\left| \\int_{S^{2}} \\text{Jac}(u) \\,dA_{g} \\right| \\leq \\int_{S^{2}} |\\text{Jac}(u)| \\,dA_{g}.\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the integral of the Jacobian, we get\n$$\n|4\\pi \\deg(u)| \\leq \\int_{S^{2}} |\\text{Jac}(u)| \\,dA_{g},\n$$\nwhich simplifies to $4\\pi |\\deg(u)| \\leq \\int_{S^{2}} |\\text{Jac}(u)| \\,dA_{g}$.\nCombining this with our previous inequality for the energy, $E(u) \\geq \\int_{S^{2}} |\\text{Jac}(u)| \\,dA_{g}$, we arrive at the desired lower bound for the energy:\n$$\nE(u) \\geq 4\\pi |\\deg(u)|.\n$$\n\nSecond, we specialize this bound to the case of a weakly conformal map $u$ and identify when equality is achieved. A map is weakly conformal if its singular values are equal almost everywhere, i.e., $\\sigma_1(x) = \\sigma_2(x)$ for almost every $x \\in S^2$.\nFor such a map, the inequality $\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2 \\geq 2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2$ becomes an equality almost everywhere. This means the first inequality in our derivation becomes an equality:\n$$\nE(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{S^{2}} (\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2) \\,dA_{g} = \\int_{S^{2}} \\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2} \\,dA_{g} = \\int_{S^{2}} |\\text{Jac}(u)| \\,dA_{g}.\n$$\nThe final bound $E(u) \\geq 4\\pi |\\deg(u)|$ becomes an equality, $E(u) = 4\\pi |\\deg(u)|$, if and only if the second inequality in the derivation, $\\int_{S^{2}} |\\text{Jac}(u)| \\,dA_{g} \\geq | \\int_{S^{2}} \\text{Jac}(u) \\,dA_{g} |$, is also an equality. This occurs if and only if the integrand $\\text{Jac}(u)$ has a fixed sign (i.e., is either non-negative or non-positive) almost everywhere on $S^2$. A non-negative Jacobian corresponds to an orientation-preserving map, while a non-positive Jacobian corresponds to an orientation-reversing map.\nTherefore, for a weakly conformal map $u$, the energy achieves the lower bound $E(u) = 4\\pi |\\deg(u)|$ if and only if $u$ is either orientation-preserving almost everywhere or orientation-reversing almost everywhere. The provided example of Möbius transformations, which are orientation-preserving conformal maps of degree $1$, fits this characterization, and their energy is indeed $4\\pi$.\n\nThird, we determine the smallest positive energy of a nontrivial harmonic two-sphere bubble. A \"harmonic two-sphere bubble\" is understood to be a non-constant harmonic map $u_{\\text{bubble}}: S^2 \\to S^2$. A fundamental result in the theory of harmonic maps states that any harmonic map from a $2$-dimensional domain, such as $S^2$, is weakly conformal. Furthermore, harmonic maps from $S^2$ to $S^2$ are known to be conformal, which means they are either holomorphic or anti-holomorphic when $S^2$ is identified with the Riemann sphere. Consequently, they are either orientation-preserving or orientation-reversing.\nThis means that for any such bubble map $u_{\\text{bubble}}$, the condition for equality in the energy bound is satisfied. Thus, its energy is given precisely by\n$$\nE(u_{\\text{bubble}}) = 4\\pi |\\deg(u_{\\text{bubble}})|.\n$$\nThe topological degree of a continuous map between closed, oriented manifolds like $S^2$ must be an integer, so $\\deg(u_{\\text{bubble}}) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The bubble is \"nontrivial,\" meaning it is not a constant map. A theorem by Eells and Wood states that a harmonic map from $S^2$ to $S^2$ with degree zero must be constant. Since our bubble is non-constant, its degree must be a non-zero integer: $\\deg(u_{\\text{bubble}}) \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nTo find the smallest positive energy, we must find the minimum possible value of $E(u_{\\text{bubble}}) = 4\\pi |\\deg(u_{\\text{bubble}})|$ under this condition. The smallest positive value that $|\\deg(u_{\\text{bubble}})|$ can take is $1$.\nTherefore, the smallest positive energy that a nontrivial harmonic two-sphere bubble can carry is\n$$\nE_{\\min} = 4\\pi \\times 1 = 4\\pi.\n$$\nThe sequence $u_{\\lambda} = \\Phi_\\lambda$ given in the problem serves to illustrate that this energy quantum is physically realized in the bubbling phenomenon. Each map $u_\\lambda$ is an orientation-preserving conformal automorphism of degree $1$. By our analysis, its energy is exactly $E(u_{\\lambda}) = 4\\pi(1) = 4\\pi$. As $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, the sequence of maps $u_\\lambda$ converges (pointwise away from the south pole) to a constant map, which has zero energy. The energy of the sequence, $4\\pi$, does not vanish but instead concentrates at a single point, forming a \"bubble\" whose energy content is precisely the difference $\\lim_{\\lambda \\to \\infty} E(u_\\lambda) - E(u_\\infty) = 4\\pi - 0 = 4\\pi$. This confirms that $4\\pi$ is not just a theoretical minimum but the fundamental quantum of energy for such bubbles.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi}\n$$"}, {"introduction": "Abstract principles become truly clear when seen in concrete action.

Justification of Harmonicity**\n\nA map between Riemannian manifolds is harmonic if it is a critical point of the Dirichlet energy. For a map from a $2$-dimensional domain, conformality is a sufficient condition for harmonicity. We show that $U_{\\lambda}$ is a conformal map from $(\\mathbb{R}^{2}, g_{\\text{Euc}})$ to $(\\mathbb{S}^{2}, g_{\\mathbb{S}^2})$.\n\nLet $x = (x_1, x_2)$ and $r^2 = |x|^2$. The components of $U_{\\lambda}$ are $U^1 = \\frac{2\\lambda x_1}{\\lambda^2+r^2}$, $U^2 = \\frac{2\\lambda x_2}{\\lambda^2+r^2}$, and $U^3 = \\frac{r^2-\\lambda^2}{\\lambda^2+r^2}$. We compute the partial derivatives with respect to $x_1$ and $x_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{2\\lambda}{(\\lambda^2+r^2)^2} \\left( \\lambda^2+x_2^2-x_1^2, -2x_1x_2, 2\\lambda x_1 \\right),\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{2\\lambda}{(\\lambda^2+r^2)^2} \\left( -2x_1x_2, \\lambda^2+x_1^2-x_2^2, 2\\lambda x_2 \\right).\n$$\nTo check for conformality, we compute the components of the pullback metric $g_{ij} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}}{\\partial x_i}, \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}}{\\partial x_j} \\right\\rangle$.\nA direct calculation shows:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}}{\\partial x_1}\\right|^2 = \\frac{4\\lambda^2}{(\\lambda^2+r^2)^4} \\left[ (\\lambda^2+x_2^2-x_1^2)^2 + 4x_1^2x_2^2 + 4\\lambda^2x_1^2 \\right] = \\frac{4\\lambda^2}{(\\lambda^2+r^2)^4} (\\lambda^2+r^2)^2 = \\frac{4\\lambda^2}{(\\lambda^2+r^2)^2}.\n$$\nBy symmetry, $\\left|\\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}}{\\partial x_2}\\right|^2 = \\frac{4\\lambda^2}{(\\lambda^2+r^2)^2}$.\nFor the off-diagonal term:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial U_{\\lambda}}{\\partial x_2} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{4\\lambda^2}{(\\lambda^2+r^2)^2} \\left[ -2x_1x_2(\\lambda^2+x_2^2-x_1^2) -2x_1x_2(\\lambda^2+x_1^2-x_2^2) + 4\\lambda^2x_1x_2 \\right] = 0.\n$$\nThus, the pullback metric is $U_{\\lambda}^*g_{\\mathbb{S}^2} = \\frac{4\\lambda^2}{(\\lambda^2+|x|^2)^2} g_{\\text{Euc}}$. Since the pullback metric is a scalar multiple of the Euclidean metric, the map $U_{\\lambda}$ is conformal. As any conformal map from a $2$-dimensional domain is harmonic, $U_{\\lambda}$ is a harmonic map on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Consequently, its restriction $u_k = U_{\\lambda_k}|_{B_1(0)}$ is harmonic on $B_1(0)$ for each $k$.\n\n**2. Computation of Energy and its Limit**\n\nThe Dirichlet energy density of $u_k$ is $e(u_k) = \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla u_k|^2$. Since $u_k$ is conformal, this is given by the conformal factor of the pullback metric:\n$$\ne(u_k)(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\left|\\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_1}\\right|^2 + \\left|\\frac{\\partial u_k}{\\partial x_2}\\right|^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4\\lambda_k^2}{(\\lambda_k^2+|x|^2)^2} + \\frac{4\\lambda_k^2}{(\\lambda_k^2+|x|^2)^2} \\right) = \\frac{4\\lambda_k^2}{(\\lambda_k^2+|x|^2)^2}.\n$$\nThe total energy on $B_1(0)$ is $\\mu_k(B_1(0)) = \\int_{B_1(0)} e(u_k) dx$. We switch to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $|x|=r$ and $dx = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$.\n$$\n\\mu_k(B_1(0)) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^1 \\frac{4\\lambda_k^2}{(\\lambda_k^2+r^2)^2} r\\,dr\\,d\\theta = 2\\pi \\int_0^1 \\frac{4\\lambda_k^2 r}{(\\lambda_k^2+r^2)^2} dr.\n$$\nWe use the substitution $s = \\lambda_k^2+r^2$, so $ds = 2r\\,dr$. The limits of integration become $s=\\lambda_k^2$ for $r=0$ and $s=\\lambda_k^2+1$ for $r=1$.\n$$\n\\mu_k(B_1(0)) = 2\\pi \\int_{\\lambda_k^2}^{\\lambda_k^2+1} \\frac{2\\lambda_k^2}{s^2} ds = 4\\pi\\lambda_k^2 \\left[-\\frac{1}{s}\\right]_{\\lambda_k^2}^{\\lambda_k^2+1} = 4\\pi\\lambda_k^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda_k^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_k^2+1} \\right).\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_k(B_1(0)) = 4\\pi\\lambda_k^2 \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_k^2+1-\\lambda_k^2}{\\lambda_k^2(\\lambda_k^2+1)} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda_k^2+1}.\n$$\nAs $k\\to\\infty$, $\\lambda_k = \\exp(-k) \\to 0$. Therefore, the limit of the total energy is:\n$$\n\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\mu_k(B_1(0)) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda_k^2+1} = 4\\pi.\n$$\n\n**3. Weak Limit and Defect Measure**\n\nFirst, we determine the pointwise limit of $u_k(x)$ as $k \\to \\infty$. For any fixed $x \\in B_1(0) \\setminus \\{0\\}$, we have $|x|>0$. Since $\\lambda_k \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} u_k(x) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\left(\\frac{2\\lambda_k x_{1}}{\\lambda_k^{2} + |x|^{2}},\\, \\frac{2\\lambda_k x_{2}}{\\lambda_k^{2} + |x|^{2}},\\, \\frac{|x|^{2} - \\lambda_k^{2}}{\\lambda_k^{2} + |x|^{2}}\\right) = \\left(0, 0, \\frac{|x|^2}{|x|^2}\\right) = (0,0,1).\n$$\nThis is the North Pole $N$ of $\\mathbb{S}^2$. At $x=0$, $u_k(0) = (0,0,-1)$, the South Pole. The pointwise limit is discontinuous. The sequence $\\{u_k\\}$ is bounded in $H^1(B_1(0))$ since its energy is bounded. The weak limit $u$ in $H^1$ must be the constant map $u(x) = (0,0,1)$ for almost every $x \\in B_1(0)$. Being a constant map, its energy density is $e(u) = \\frac{1}{2}|\\nabla u|^2 = 0$.\n\nThe defect measure $\\nu$ is defined by the weak convergence $\\mu_k \\rightharpoonup e(u)dx + \\nu$. According to small-energy $\\varepsilon$-regularity theory for harmonic maps, if the energy on a ball is sufficiently small, the map is regular inside a smaller concentric ball. For any point $x_0 \\in B_1(0) \\setminus \\{0\\}$, we can find a small ball $B_r(x_0)$ not containing the origin. The energy of $u_k$ on this ball is:\n$$\n\\int_{B_r(x_0)} e(u_k) dx = \\int_{B_r(x_0)} \\frac{4\\lambda_k^2}{(\\lambda_k^2+|x|^2)^2} dx.\n$$\nSince $0 \\notin B_r(x_0)$, there exists $\\delta>0$ such that $|x| \\ge \\delta$ for all $x \\in B_r(x_0)$. Thus, the integrand is bounded by $4\\lambda_k^2/\\delta^4$, and the integral goes to $0$ as $k \\to \\infty$. This implies that for any compact set $K \\subset B_1(0)\\setminus\\{0\\}$, $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\int_K e(u_k)dx = 0$. This means the energy measure $\\mu_k$ converges weakly to $0$ away from the origin. Consequently, the defect measure $\\nu$ must be supported at the origin, i.e., $\\text{supp}(\\nu) \\subseteq \\{0\\}$.\n\n**4. Total Mass of the Defect Measure and Comparison**\n\nThe total mass of $\\nu$ on $B_1(0)$ can be found using the definition of weak convergence of measures with the test function $\\phi(x) = 1$.\n$$\n\\nu(B_1(0)) = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\mu_k(B_1(0)) - \\int_{B_1(0)} e(u) dx.\n$$\nFrom our previous calculations, we have $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\mu_k(B_1(0)) = 4\\pi$ and $\\int_{B_1(0)} e(u) dx = 0$.\nTherefore, the total mass of the defect measure is:\n$$\n\\nu(B_1(0)) = 4\\pi - 0 = 4\\pi.\n$$\nThis phenomenon is known as energy quantization. The \"lost\" energy in the weak limit concentrates at the singularity and equals the energy of a \"bubble\". A bubble corresponds to a non-constant harmonic map from $\\mathbb{S}^2$ to $\\mathbb{S}^2$. The map $U_\\lambda(x)$ is, up to composition with an isometry, the inverse stereographic projection of a scaled coordinate, which conformally maps $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cup \\{\\infty\\} \\cong \\mathbb{S}^2$ to $\\mathbb{S}^2$. The degree of this map is $1$ (or $-1$ depending on orientation conventions). The energy of a harmonic map $f: \\mathbb{S}^2 \\to \\mathbb{S}^2$ is given by $E(f)=4\\pi|\\deg(f)|$. For a degree-$1$ map, the energy is $4\\pi$. Our result $\\nu(B_1(0)) = 4\\pi$ confirms that the energy lost in the bubbling process is precisely the energy of a single, degree-$1$ harmonic sphere.\n\nThe question asks for the exact value of the total mass $\\nu(B_1(0))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi}\n$$"}, {"introduction": "Bubbling phenomena can involve more complex topological structures, leading to energy quanta that are multiples of the fundamental value.

The Dirichlet energy of a map $u$ over a region $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{B}_{1}$ is given by\n$$\nE(u;\\Omega) = \\int_{\\Omega} |\\nabla u|^{2} \\, dx.\n$$\nFor a sequence of stationary harmonic maps $u_{k}$ with uniformly bounded energies, the energy densities $|\\nabla u_{k}|^{2} \\, dx$ define Radon measures $\\mu_{k}$. By standard compactness and lower semicontinuity, there exists a subsequence (not relabeled) such that $\\mu_{k} \\rightharpoonup \\mu$ weakly as measures. The weak limit splits as\n$$\n\\mu = |\\nabla u|^{2} \\, dx + \\nu,\n$$\nwhere $\\nu$ is a nonnegative Radon measure capturing the energy lost in concentration phenomena (bubbles). Because $u_{k} \\to u$ smoothly away from the origin and the only concentration point is $0$, it follows that $\\operatorname{supp}(\\nu) \\subset \\{0\\}$, hence $\\nu = c \\, \\delta_{0}$ for some $c \\ge 0$. Our task is to determine the exact value of $c$.\n\nA fundamental tool is the monotonicity formula for stationary harmonic maps. For a stationary harmonic map $w : \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathcal{N}$ (with $\\mathcal{N}$ a Riemannian manifold), the function\n$$\n\\Theta_{w}(x,r) := r^{2-n} \\int_{B_{r}(x)} |\\nabla w|^{2} \\, dx\n$$\nis monotonically nondecreasing in $r$, and satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\Theta_{w}(x,r) = 2 r^{1-n} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(x)} |\\partial_{r} w|^{2} \\, d\\sigma \\ge 0.\n$$\nIn our two-dimensional case ($n=2$), the monotonicity quantity simplifies to\n$$\n\\Theta_{w}(x,r) = \\int_{B_{r}(x)} |\\nabla w|^{2} \\, dx,\n$$\nwhich is monotone nondecreasing in $r$ because\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\Theta_{w}(x,r) = 2 r^{-1} \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(x)} |\\partial_{r} w|^{2} \\, d\\sigma \\ge 0.\n$$\nApplying this to each $u_{k}$ centered at $x=0$, we have the monotone functions\n$$\n\\Theta_{k}(r) := \\int_{B_{r}} |\\nabla u_{k}|^{2} \\, dx.\n$$\nThe weak convergence of $\\mu_{k}$ to $\\mu$ implies that for each fixed $r \\in (0,1)$,\n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\Theta_{k}(r) = \\mu(B_{r}) = \\int_{B_{r}} |\\nabla u|^{2} \\, dx + \\nu(B_{r}).\n$$\nAs $\\operatorname{supp}(\\nu) \\subset \\{0\\}$, we have $\\nu(B_{r}) = \\nu(\\{0\\})$ for all $r>0$, hence the limit is\n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\Theta_{k}(r) = \\int_{B_{r}} |\\nabla u|^{2} \\, dx + c,\n$$\nwith $c = \\nu(\\{0\\})$ independent of $r$. The monotonicity in $r$ persists in the limit, and in particular taking $r \\downarrow 0$ yields\n$$\n\\lim_{r \\downarrow 0} \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\int_{B_{r}} |\\nabla u_{k}|^{2} \\, dx\n= \\lim_{r \\downarrow 0} \\left( \\int_{B_{r}} |\\nabla u|^{2} \\, dx + c \\right)\n= c,\n$$\nbecause the removable singularity theorem for harmonic maps in two dimensions implies $u$ extends harmonically across $0$ and hence $\\int_{B_{r}} |\\nabla u|^{2} \\, dx \\to 0$ as $r \\downarrow 0$. The extension at $0$ is unique (by uniqueness of harmonic extensions under fixed boundary data on circles shrinking to $0$ and energy minimality), so no additional diffuse energy arises at the point.\n\nThus, $c$ is precisely the total energy concentrating at the origin at the small scales. To identify $c$, we use the given blow-up information: there exists $r_{k} \\to 0$ such that the rescaled maps $v_{k}(y) := u_{k}(r_{k} y)$ converge in $W^{1,2}_{\\mathrm{loc}}(\\mathbb{R}^{2},\\mathbb{S}^{2})$ and smoothly away from $0$ to a nontrivial harmonic sphere $\\omega : \\mathbb{S}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{S}^{2}$, which is the holomorphic rational map of degree $2$ induced by $z \\mapsto z^{2}$. The rescaling preserves the two-dimensional energy on balls in the sense that for fixed $R>0$,\n$$\n\\int_{B_{R}} |\\nabla v_{k}|^{2} \\, dy = \\int_{B_{R r_{k}}} |\\nabla u_{k}|^{2} \\, dx.\n$$\nPassing to the limit $k \\to \\infty$, then sending $R \\to \\infty$, and using that $v_{k} \\to \\omega$ and $\\omega$ extends to a smooth map on the conformal compactification $\\mathbb{S}^{2}$, we identify the entire concentrated energy as the energy of the bubble:\n$$\nc = E(\\omega;\\mathbb{S}^{2}).\n$$\n\nIt remains to compute $E(\\omega;\\mathbb{S}^{2})$. A foundational fact in the theory of harmonic maps between Riemann surfaces is that holomorphic (or anti-holomorphic) maps are harmonic and conformal, and their Dirichlet energy equals $4\\pi$ times the topological degree. Specifically, if $\\omega : \\mathbb{S}^{2} \\to \\mathbb{S}^{2}$ is holomorphic of degree $d \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (with respect to the standard complex structures compatible with the round metrics), then\n$$\nE(\\omega;\\mathbb{S}^{2}) = 4\\pi d.\n$$\nIn our case, $\\omega$ is induced by $z \\mapsto z^{2}$ on the Riemann sphere, hence $\\deg(\\omega) = 2$ and therefore\n$$\nE(\\omega;\\mathbb{S}^{2}) = 4\\pi \\cdot 2 = 8\\pi.\n$$\nConsequently, the defect measure is\n$$\n\\nu = 8\\pi \\, \\delta_{0},\n$$\nand the requested coefficient is\n$$\nc = 8\\pi.\n$$\n\nThis computation is directly linked to the monotonicity formula: the monotone quantity $\\Theta_{k}(r)$ converges to $\\int_{B_{r}} |\\nabla u|^{2} \\, dx + c$, and its jump as $r \\downarrow 0$ is exactly the bubble energy, which the blow-up analysis identifies as $E(\\omega) = 8\\pi$. The removable singularity and uniqueness guarantee that the weak limit map $u$ contributes no additional point mass at $0$, isolating the defect measure entirely to the bubble and fixing its coefficient.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8\\pi}$$"}]}
