First, we compute the left-hand side (LHS), which is the time derivative of the metric tensor:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left( r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}} \\right)\n$$\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is independent of time, the derivative acts only on the scalar function $r(t)^{2}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\left( \\frac{d}{dt}r(t)^{2} \\right) g_{\\mathrm{can}} = \\left( 2\\,r(t)\\,\\frac{dr}{dt} \\right) g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nLet us denote $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ by $r'(t)$. The LHS is then:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = 2\\,r(t)\\,r'(t)\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the right-hand side (RHS) of the Ricci flow equation. The problem provides the formula for the Ricci tensor of a round $3$-sphere with metric $g$ and radius $r$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g) = \\frac{2}{r^{2}}\\,g\n$$\nIn our case, the metric at time $t$ is $g(t)$ and the radius is $r(t)$. Therefore, the Ricci tensor at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\frac{2}{r(t)^{2}}\\,g(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $g(t) = r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ into this formula, we get:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\frac{2}{r(t)^{2}}\\,(r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = 2\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nNow, the RHS of the Ricci flow equation is $-2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))$:\n$$\n-2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = -2\\,(2\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = -4\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS, we have:\n$$\n2\\,r(t)\\,r'(t)\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}} = -4\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is a non-degenerate metric tensor, we can equate the scalar coefficients on both sides:\n$$\n2\\,r(t)\\,r'(t) = -4\n$$\nThis simplifies to the following ordinary differential equation for the radius $r(t)$:\n$$\nr(t)\\,\\frac{dr}{dt} = -2\n$$\n\nThis is a separable first-order ODE. We can write it as:\n$$\nr\\,dr = -2\\,dt\n$$\nTo find the solution $r(t)$, we integrate both sides.

This condition gives a relationship between $s$ and $r$:\n$$\n2\\pi^2 r^3 = 8\\pi^2 r^2 s\n$$\nDividing by $2\\pi^2 r^2$ (since $r > 0$), we get:\n$$\nr = 4s \\quad \\text{or} \\quad s = \\frac{r}{4}\n$$\nUnder this normalization, $V_1 = V_2$, and consequently $\\ln(V_1) = \\ln(V_2)$.\n\nNow we compute the difference $\\Delta\\mu(\\tau)$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu(\\tau) = \\mu(S^3(r), \\tau) - \\mu(S^2(r) \\times S^1(s), \\tau)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu(\\tau) = \\left( \\tau \\frac{6}{r^2} + \\ln(V_1) - \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(4\\pi\\tau) - 3 \\right) - \\left( \\tau \\frac{2}{r^2} + \\ln(V_2) - \\frac{3}{2}\\ln(4\\pi\\tau) - 3 \\right)\n$$\nThe terms involving $\\ln(4\\pi\\tau)$ and the constant $-3$ cancel out.\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu(\\tau) = \\tau \\frac{6}{r^2} - \\tau \\frac{2}{r^2} + \\ln(V_1) - \\ln(V_2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu(\\tau) = \\tau \\left( \\frac{6-2}{r^2} \\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\nApplying the equal-volume condition $V_1 = V_2$, the logarithmic term becomes $\\ln(1) = 0$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu(\\tau) = \\tau \\frac{4}{r^2}\n$$\nThis expression is the exact difference in the $\\mu$-entropies for any $\\tau > 0$ under the given conditions. The question asks for the leading-order small-$\\tau$ asymptotic.
