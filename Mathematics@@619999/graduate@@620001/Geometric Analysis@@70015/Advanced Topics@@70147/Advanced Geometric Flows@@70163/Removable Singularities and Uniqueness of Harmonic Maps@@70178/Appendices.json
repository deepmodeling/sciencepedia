A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is systematically constructed by following the three tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Construction of the Energy Minimizer and Computation of its Energy**\n\nThe minimizer of the Dirichlet energy functional on $\\Omega_{R}$ with the specified boundary conditions is the unique solution to the Laplace equation $\\Delta v = 0$ on $\\Omega_R$. Due to the spherical symmetry of the domain $\\Omega_{R}$ and the boundary data, the solution $v_{R}$ must be a radial function. We express it as $v_{R}(\\mathbf{x}) = u(|\\mathbf{x}|) = u(\\rho)$, where $\\rho = |\\mathbf{x}|$ is the radial coordinate.\n\nIn $n$-dimensional spherical coordinates, the Laplacian of a radial function $u(\\rho)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta u = u''(\\rho) + \\frac{n-1}{\\rho}u'(\\rho)\n$$\nSetting $\\Delta u = 0$ yields a second-order ordinary differential equation for $u(\\rho)$:\n$$\nu''(\\rho) + \\frac{n-1}{\\rho}u'(\\rho) = 0\n$$\nThis equation is separable. Letting $w(\\rho) = u'(\\rho)$, we have $w'(\\rho) = -\\frac{n-1}{\\rho}w(\\rho)$. The solution is $w(\\rho) = C_{1}\\rho^{-(n-1)}$. Integrating $u'(\\rho) = w(\\rho)$ gives, for $n \\geq 3$:\n$$\nu(\\rho) = \\int C_{1}\\rho^{-(n-1)} \\, d\\rho = C_{1} \\frac{\\rho^{2-n}}{2-n} + C_{2}\n$$\nWe can write the general solution as $u(\\rho) = A\\rho^{2-n} + B$. The constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by the boundary conditions:\n1.  $u(r) = 1 \\implies Ar^{2-n} + B = 1$\n2.  $u(R) = 0 \\implies AR^{2-n} + B = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, $B = -AR^{2-n}$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$\nA(r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}) = 1 \\implies A = \\frac{1}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}}\n$$\nThus, $B = -\\frac{R^{2-n}}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}}$. The energy-minimizing function is:\n$$\nv_{R}(\\mathbf{x}) = u(\\rho) = \\frac{\\rho^{2-n} - R^{2-n}}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}} \\quad \\text{for } \\rho = |\\mathbf{x}| \\in [r, R]\n$$\nThe corresponding Dirichlet energy is $E(v_{R}) = \\int_{\\Omega_{R}} |\\nabla v_{R}|^{2} \\, dx$. We use Green's first identity:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_{R}} |\\nabla v_{R}|^{2} \\, dx = - \\int_{\\Omega_{R}} v_{R} \\Delta v_{R} \\, dx + \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_{R}} v_{R} \\frac{\\partial v_{R}}{\\partial \\nu} \\, dS\n$$\nSince $\\Delta v_{R} = 0$ in $\\Omega_{R}$, the volume integral vanishes. The boundary $\\partial \\Omega_{R}$ consists of two components: $\\partial B_{R}(0)$ and $\\partial B_{r}(0)$.\n$$\nE(v_{R}) = \\int_{\\partial B_{R}(0)} v_{R} \\frac{\\partial v_{R}}{\\partial \\nu} \\, dS + \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(0)} v_{R} \\frac{\\partial v_{R}}{\\partial \\nu} \\, dS\n$$\nOn $\\partial B_{R}(0)$, we have $v_{R} = 0$, so the first integral is zero. On $\\partial B_{r}(0)$, we have $v_{R} = 1$. The outward unit normal vector to $\\Omega_{R}$ on this boundary is $\\nu = -\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{r}$. The gradient of $v_R$ is $\\nabla v_{R} = u'(\\rho) \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\rho}$. The normal derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v_{R}}{\\partial \\nu} = \\nabla v_{R} \\cdot \\nu = u'(r) \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{r} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{r}\\right) = -u'(r)\n$$\nWe compute $u'(\\rho) = A(2-n)\\rho^{1-n} = \\frac{(2-n)\\rho^{1-n}}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}}$. At $\\rho=r$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v_{R}}{\\partial \\nu} = -u'(r) = -\\frac{(2-n)r^{1-n}}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}} = \\frac{(n-2)r^{1-n}}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}}\n$$\nThe integrand is constant over the sphere $\\partial B_{r}(0)$. The surface area of $\\partial B_{r}(0)$ is $\\omega_{n-1}r^{n-1}$. The energy is:\n$$\nE(v_{R}) = \\int_{\\partial B_{r}(0)} (1) \\left(\\frac{(n-2)r^{1-n}}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}}\\right) \\, dS = \\left(\\frac{(n-2)r^{1-n}}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}}\\right) (\\omega_{n-1}r^{n-1})\n$$\n$$\nE(v_{R}) = \\frac{\\omega_{n-1}(n-2)}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}}\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Capacity**\n\nThe Newtonian capacity of the ball $B_{r}(0)$ is obtained by taking the limit of the energy as $R \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cap}(B_{r}(0)) = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} E(v_{R}) = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\omega_{n-1}(n-2)}{r^{2-n} - R^{2-n}}\n$$\nSince $n \\geq 3$, the exponent $2-n$ is negative. Therefore, as $R \\to \\infty$, $R^{2-n} \\to 0$. The limit becomes:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cap}(B_{r}(0)) = \\frac{\\omega_{n-1}(n-2)}{r^{2-n}} = \\omega_{n-1}(n-2)r^{n-2}\n$$\n\n**3. Limit of the Scale-Invariant Normalized Capacity**\n\nThe final task is to compute the limit of the scale-invariant quantity $r^{2-n} \\operatorname{Cap}(B_{r}(0))$ as $r \\to 0^{+}$. Using the expression for the capacity derived in the previous step:\n$$\nr^{2-n} \\operatorname{Cap}(B_{r}(0)) = r^{2-n} \\left(\\omega_{n-1}(n-2)r^{n-2}\\right)\n$$\nThe terms involving $r$ cancel:\n$$\nr^{2-n} r^{n-2} = r^{(2-n) + (n-2)} = r^{0} = 1\n$$\nThis leaves a constant value that is independent of $r$:\n$$\nr^{2-n} \\operatorname{Cap}(B_{r}(0)) = \\omega_{n-1}(n-2)\n$$\nSince the expression is constant, its limit as $r \\to 0^{+}$ is simply the constant itself.\n$$\n\\lim_{r \\to 0^{+}} r^{2-n} \\operatorname{Cap}(B_{r}(0)) = \\omega_{n-1}(n-2)\n$$\nThis constant represents the capacity of the unit ball, $\\operatorname{Cap}(B_{1}(0))$, and characterizes the fundamental energy scale associated with a point singularity in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for harmonic functions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\omega_{n-1}(n-2)}$$", "id": "3033199"}, {"introduction": "With the tool of capacity to measure energy concentration, we now turn to a cornerstone example where a singularity persists despite the map having finite total energy.

For $x \\in B^3 \\setminus \\{0\\}$, the map $u$ is smooth. We compute its Laplacian, $\\Delta u$. The components are $u_i(x) = x_i|x|^{-1}$.

First, we compute the distributional Laplacian of $u$. The map $u(x)$ defines a distribution on $B^3$ as it belongs to $L^p_{loc}(B^3)$ for any $p  \\infty$. We use the product rule for distributions, where $u_i = x_i |x|^{-1}$. $x_i$ is a smooth function. The distributional Laplacian of $|x|^{-1}$ is given as $\\Delta(|x|^{-1}) = -4\\pi \\delta_0$.\n$$\n\\Delta u_i = \\Delta(x_i |x|^{-1}) = x_i \\Delta(|x|^{-1}) + |x|^{-1}\\Delta(x_i) + 2\\nabla x_i \\cdot \\nabla(|x|^{-1})\n$$\nThe second term is zero. For the first term, we evaluate the distribution $x_i \\delta_0$. For any test function $\\phi \\in C_c^\\infty(B^3)$, $\\langle x_i \\delta_0, \\phi \\rangle = \\langle \\delta_0, x_i \\phi \\rangle = (x_i \\phi)(0) = 0 \\cdot \\phi(0) = 0$. So, $x_i \\delta_0 = 0$.\nThe third term is $2 e_i \\cdot \\nabla(|x|^{-1})$. The gradient $\\nabla(|x|^{-1}) = -x/|x|^3$ is a locally integrable function in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ since $|-x/|x|^3| = 1/|x|^2$ and $\\int_{B_1} |x|^{-2} dx = 4\\pi$. So it defines a regular distribution. The product with $e_i$ is $-2x_i/|x|^3$.\nSo, the distributional Laplacian is:\n$$\n\\Delta u_i = 0 + 0 - \\frac{2x_i}{|x|^3} = -\\frac{2x_i}{|x|^3}\n$$\nThe distributional Laplacian $\\Delta u$ is represented by the locally integrable function $x \\mapsto -2x/|x|^3$.\nNow we evaluate the distributional tension field $\\tau(u) = \\Delta u + |\\nabla u|^2 u$. The term $|\\nabla u|^2 u = (2/|x|^2)(x/|x|) = 2x/|x|^3$ is also a locally integrable function, and thus defines a distribution.\nAdding the distributions:\n$$\n\\tau(u) = \\left(-\\frac{2x}{|x|^3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2x}{|x|^3}\\right) = 0\n$$\nWe conclude that, based on the provided extrinsic formula and distributional identity, the tension field $\\tau(u)$ vanishes as a distribution on $B^3$.\n\nPart 3: Non-extendibility of the map $u$\n\nWe argue by contradiction. Assume that the map $u: B^3 \\setminus \\{0\\} \\to S^2$ can be extended to a smooth (or even continuous) map $\\tilde{u}: B^3 \\to S^2$.\nConsider the restriction of the original map $u$ to a sphere $S_r = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : |x| = r\\}$ for any $r \\in (0,1)$. This restriction is a map $u|_{S_r}: S_r \\to S^2$. By identifying the sphere $S_r$ with the standard unit sphere $S^2$ via the homothety $x \\mapsto x/r$, the map $u|_{S_r}$ becomes the identity map from $S^2$ to $S^2$, since $u(x) = x/|x| = x/r$ for $x \\in S_r$.\nThe topological degree of the identity map from $S^2$ to itself is $1$. Thus, $\\text{deg}(u|_{S_r}) = 1$.\n\nIf the extension $\\tilde{u}: B^3 \\to S^2$ exists, then its restriction to the boundary $\\partial B_r = S_r$ must be our map $u|_{S_r}$. But a map on the boundary of a ball ($S_r$) that extends to the interior of the ball ($B_r$) must be null-homotopic.\nA fundamental theorem of topology states that a map from $S^2$ to $S^2$ is null-homotopic if and only if its topological degree is zero.\nWe have found that $\\text{deg}(u|_{S_r}) = 1$, which is not zero. This contradicts the conclusion that $u|_{S_r}$ must be null-homotopic.\nTherefore, our initial assumption must be false. The map $u(x)=x/|x|$ cannot be extended smoothly or continuously to include the point $x=0$.

It presents a well-known example demonstrating the failure of uniqueness for the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps into a target manifold with positive sectional curvature, the $2$-sphere $S^2$. All provided definitions, equations, and context are standard and mathematically sound.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in analyzing the solutions to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps from the unit disk $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ to the standard $2$-sphere $S^2$, with boundary data $g(\\theta) = (\\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta, 0)$ parametrizing the equator. The problem introduces the equivariant ansatz $u_\\pm(r,\\theta) = \\big( \\sin \\alpha(r) \\cos \\theta, \\, \\sin \\alpha(r) \\sin \\theta, \\, \\pm \\cos \\alpha(r) \\big)$, which reduces the harmonic map PDE to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the profile function $\\alpha(r)$:\n$$\n\\alpha''(r) + \\frac{1}{r} \\alpha'(r) - \\frac{\\sin \\alpha(r) \\cos \\alpha(r)}{r^2} = 0\n$$\nThe boundary condition $u_\\pm|_{\\partial D} = g$ translates to $\\alpha(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. To obtain a regular map on the full disk $D$, the image of the circle of radius $r$ must shrink to a point as $r \\to 0$. This requires $\\alpha(r) \\to k\\pi$ for some integer $k$ as $r \\to 0$.\n\nA known family of solutions to this ODE is $\\alpha(r) = 2 \\arctan(cr)$ for a constant $c$. The boundary condition $\\alpha(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ implies $2\\arctan(c) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which gives $\\arctan(c) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$, so $c=1$. Thus, a particular solution is $\\alpha(r) = 2 \\arctan(r)$. This solution is smooth on $[0,1]$ and satisfies $\\alpha(0)=0$.\n\nLet's define a map $u_1$ using this $\\alpha(r)$ and the positive sign in the ansatz:\n$u_1(r,\\theta) = (\\sin(2\\arctan r)\\cos\\theta, \\sin(2\\arctan r)\\sin\\theta, \\cos(2\\arctan r))$.\nUsing the identities $\\sin(2x) = \\frac{2\\tan x}{1+\\tan^2 x}$ and $\\cos(2x) = \\frac{1-\\tan^2 x}{1+\\tan^2 x}$ with $x=\\arctan r$, we get\n$$\nu_1(r,\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{2r}{1+r^2}\\cos\\theta, \\frac{2r}{1+r^2}\\sin\\theta, \\frac{1-r^2}{1+r^2} \\right).\n$$\nThis map is defined on $D\\setminus\\{0\\}$ but extends smoothly to $r=0$, where $u_1(0) = (0,0,1)$, the north pole of $S^2$. This is a smooth harmonic map on all of $D$.\n\nThe ODE has a symmetry: if $\\alpha(r)$ is a solution, then $\\tilde{\\alpha}(r) = \\pi - \\alpha(r)$ is also a solution.\n$$\n\\tilde{\\alpha}''(r) + \\frac{1}{r}\\tilde{\\alpha}'(r) - \\frac{\\sin\\tilde{\\alpha}\\cos\\tilde{\\alpha}}{r^2} = -\\alpha'' - \\frac{1}{r}\\alpha' - \\frac{\\sin(\\pi-\\alpha)\\cos(\\pi-\\alpha)}{r^2} = -\\left(\\alpha''+\\frac{1}{r}\\alpha'\\right) - \\frac{\\sin\\alpha(-\\cos\\alpha)}{r^2} = 0.\n$$\nFor $\\alpha(r) = 2\\arctan(r)$, the second solution is $\\tilde{\\alpha}(r) = \\pi - 2\\arctan(r)$. This solution satisfies the boundary condition $\\tilde{\\alpha}(1) = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and has the behavior $\\tilde{\\alpha}(r) \\to \\pi$ as $r \\to 0$.\nLet us define a map $u_2$ using $\\tilde{\\alpha}(r)$ and the positive sign in the ansatz:\n$u_2(r,\\theta) = (\\sin(\\tilde{\\alpha})\\cos\\theta, \\sin(\\tilde{\\alpha})\\sin\\theta, \\cos(\\tilde{\\alpha})) = (\\sin(\\alpha)\\cos\\theta, \\sin(\\alpha)\\sin\\theta, -\\cos(\\alpha))$.\nSo, $u_2(r,\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{2r}{1+r^2}\\cos\\theta, \\frac{2r}{1+r^2}\\sin\\theta, -\\frac{1-r^2}{1+r^2} \\right)$.\nThis map also extends smoothly to $r=0$, where $u_2(0) = (0,0,-1)$, the south pole. Note that $u_1$ corresponds to the map $u_+$ in the problem statement (with $\\alpha(r)=2\\arctan r$) and $u_2$ corresponds to $u_-$. Both are distinct smooth harmonic maps on $D$ with the same boundary values.\n\nThe Dirichlet energy for these maps is given by $E = \\pi \\int_0^1 \\left( (\\alpha')^2 + \\frac{\\sin^2 \\alpha}{r^2} \\right) r \\, dr$. For $\\alpha(r) = 2 \\arctan(r)$, we have $\\alpha'(r) = \\frac{2}{1+r^2}$ and $\\sin \\alpha(r) = \\frac{2r}{1+r^2}$.\n$$\nE = \\pi \\int_0^1 \\left( \\left(\\frac{2}{1+r^2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\left(\\frac{2r}{1+r^2}\\right)^2 \\right) r \\, dr = \\pi \\int_0^1 \\left( \\frac{4}{(1+r^2)^2} + \\frac{4}{(1+r^2)^2} \\right) r \\, dr\n$$\n$$\nE = 8\\pi \\int_0^1 \\frac{r}{(1+r^2)^2} dr = 4\\pi \\left[ -\\frac{1}{1+r^2} \\right]_0^1 = 4\\pi \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} - (-1) \\right) = 2\\pi.\n$$\nThe energy is finite. The energy for $u_2$ is the same since $(\\tilde{\\alpha}')^2 = (\\alpha')^2$ and $\\sin^2\\tilde{\\alpha} = \\sin^2\\alpha$.\n\nWith this background, we evaluate the options.\n\n**A. There exists a smooth function $\\alpha$ solving the above ordinary differential equation with $\\alpha(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\alpha(0) = 0$, such that $u_+$ is harmonic on $D \\setminus \\{0\\}$ and extends harmonically across $r=0$. Moreover $\\tilde{\\alpha}(r) = \\pi - \\alpha(r)$ produces $u_-$, which shares the same Dirichlet boundary data $g$ but is a distinct harmonic map on $D$.**\nOur analysis confirms this. The function $\\alpha(r) = 2 \\arctan(r)$ is a smooth solution to the ODE with $\\alpha(1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $\\alpha(0) = 0$. Using this $\\alpha$, the map $u_+$ from the ansatz is harmonic on $D \\setminus \\{0\\}$ and extends to a smooth harmonic map on $D$ (our $u_1$). The function $\\tilde{\\alpha}(r) = \\pi - \\alpha(r)$ is also a solution to the ODE. It generates a map (our $u_2$, which is identical to the map $u_-$ from the ansatz defined with $\\alpha$) which is harmonic, distinct from $u_1$, and shares the same boundary data. This statement is a correct description of the construction of the two solutions.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. In the standard uniqueness proof valid for targets of non-positive curvature, the step that fails for the round sphere $S^2$ is the subharmonicity of $x \\mapsto \\frac{1}{2} d_{S^2}(u(x),v(x))^2$; on $S^2$ the Hessian of the squared distance loses convexity when the pointwise distance exceeds $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so the maximum principle cannot force $u \\equiv v$.**\nThis statement accurately describes the theoretical reason for the failure of uniqueness. For two harmonic maps $u,v$ into a manifold $N$, the function $\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{2}d_N(u(x),v(x))^2$ has $\\Delta \\phi \\ge 0$ (i.e., $\\phi$ is subharmonic) if $N$ has non-positive sectional curvature. The maximum principle then forces $\\phi\\equiv 0$ if $u=v$ on the boundary, implying $u \\equiv v$. For a positively curved target like $S^2$ (with sectional curvature $K=+1$), the Bochner formula for $\\Delta \\phi$ includes a negative term depending on $K$, and $\\phi$ is no longer guaranteed to be subharmonic. The convexity of the squared distance function $p \\mapsto d(q,p)^2$ on $S^2$ fails for distances greater than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. In our explicit example, the distance between $u_+(0)$ and $u_-(0)$ is $\\pi$, far exceeding this threshold.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The maps $u_\\pm$ have infinite Dirichlet energy near $r=0$, so the removable singularity theorem for harmonic maps from two-dimensional domains cannot be applied; they cannot be extended harmonically across $r=0$.**\nThis statement is false. As calculated above, the Dirichlet energy of both maps $u_+$ and $u_-$ (corresponding to the solutions $\\alpha$ and $\\tilde{\\alpha}$) is finite, $E=2\\pi$. Because the energy is finite, the removable singularity theorem for harmonic maps from a 2D domain does apply, guaranteeing the existence of smooth harmonic extensions to the full disk $D$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If both images are contained in a geodesic ball of radius strictly less than $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in $S^2$, then the subharmonicity argument recovers uniqueness; in particular, for equator boundary data $g$, uniqueness holds.**\nThe first part of the statement is a correct theorem from the theory of harmonic maps (due to Hildebrandt, Kaul, and Widman). However, the conclusion \"in particular, for equator boundary data $g$, uniqueness holds\" is false. The boundary data $g$ is the equator of $S^2$, which is a great circle. Any geodesic ball containing the equator must have a radius of at least $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Therefore, the condition for the uniqueness theorem is not met. Indeed, we have explicitly constructed two distinct solutions, $u_+$ and $u_-$, whose images are the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively (geodesic balls of radius $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$), demonstrating the failure of uniqueness for this boundary data.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The failure of uniqueness in this example is caused by the curvature of the domain $D$; on a flat disk, the Laplace operator does not satisfy a maximum principle strong enough to imply uniqueness.**\nThis statement is false. The domain $D$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and is considered flat (zero curvature). The failure of uniqueness is fundamentally due to the positive curvature of the target manifold $S^2$, as explained in the analysis of option B. The standard Laplacian on the flat domain $D$ satisfies a strong maximum principle; the issue is not the principle itself, but the inability to prove that the function $\\frac{1}{2}d^2(u,v)$ is subharmonic.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. Although initially defined on the punctured disk $D \\setminus \\{0\\}$, each of $u_\\pm$ has finite Dirichlet energy and, by the removable singularity theorem for harmonic maps from two-dimensional domains, extends smoothly to a harmonic map on $D$; thus there are two distinct harmonic extensions realizing the same Dirichlet boundary data $g$ into $S^2$.**\nThis statement is an entirely correct summary of the situation. As we calculated, the energy is $E=2\\pi$, which is finite. The removable singularity theorem (e.g., Sacks-Uhlenbeck) for harmonic maps from a 2D domain states that a finite-energy harmonic map on a punctured disk extends to a smooth harmonic map over the puncture. Applying this to $u_+$ and $u_-$ (defined via $\\alpha(r) = 2\\arctan r$), we conclude they both extend to smooth harmonic maps on $D$. These extensions are distinct ($u_+(0) \\neq u_-(0)$) and satisfy the same boundary condition.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABF}$$", "id": "3033221"}]}
