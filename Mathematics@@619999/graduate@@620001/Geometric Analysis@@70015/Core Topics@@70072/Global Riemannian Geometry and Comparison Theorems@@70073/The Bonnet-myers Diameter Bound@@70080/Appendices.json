The derivation proceeds in two steps as requested.\n\n**Part 1: The normalized case with $k=1$**\n\nWe are given a complete, connected Riemannian manifold $\\left(M^{n},g\\right)$ of dimension $n \\geq 2$ with Ricci curvature satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g}\\left(v,v\\right) \\geq \\left(n-1\\right)g\\left(v,v\\right)$ for all tangent vectors $v \\in TM$.

To show $\\operatorname{diam}\\left(M,g\\right) \\le \\pi$, it suffices to show that $L \\le \\pi$ for any such geodesic.\n\nWe argue by contradiction. Assume that $L > \\pi$. Since $\\gamma$ is a minimizing geodesic, the second variation of the arc length functional must be non-negative for any proper variation of $\\gamma$. The second variation is given by the index form $I(V, V)$, where $V$ is a piecewise smooth vector field along $\\gamma$ such that $V(0) = 0$ and $V(L) = 0$. The formula for the index form is:\n$$ I\\left(V, V\\right) = \\int_0^L \\left( g\\left(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V, \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V\\right) - g\\left(R\\left(V, \\dot{\\gamma}\\right)\\dot{\\gamma}, V\\right) \\right) dt $$\nwhere $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor. If we can construct a vector field $V$ satisfying the boundary conditions for which $I(V,V)  0$, we will have a contradiction, proving that our assumption $L > \\pi$ is false.\n\nLet $\\{E_i(t)\\}_{i=1}^{n-1}$ be a set of $n-1$ vector fields that form a parallel orthonormal frame for the orthogonal complement of $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ in $T_{\\gamma(t)}M$.

Since $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = 1$. The bound becomes $\\operatorname{Ric}_g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\ge n-1$. Inserting this into the integral gives an upper bound for the sum:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} I\\left(V_i, V_i\\right) \\le \\int_0^L \\left( (n-1)\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) - (n-1)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) \\right) dt $$\n$$ = (n-1) \\int_0^L \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) - \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) \\right) dt $$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the standard results $\\int_0^L \\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) dt = \\frac{L}{2}$ and $\\int_0^L \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{L}\\right) dt = \\frac{L}{2}$.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} I\\left(V_i, V_i\\right) \\le (n-1) \\left( \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\frac{L}{2} - \\frac{L}{2} \\right) = \\frac{(n-1)L}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} - 1 \\right) $$\nNow, recall our initial assumption: $L > \\pi$. This implies $L^2 > \\pi^2$, and so $\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2}  1$. Consequently, the term $\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{L^2} - 1\\right)$ is negative. Since $n \\ge 2$ and $L>0$, the entire expression is negative:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} I\\left(V_i, V_i\\right)  0 $$\nIf the sum of these terms is negative, at least one of the terms must be negative. That is, there exists some $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ such that $I(V_j, V_j)  0$. This contradicts the fact that $\\gamma$ is a length-minimizing geodesic, for which the second variation must be non-negative for all proper variations.\nTherefore, the assumption $L > \\pi$ must be false. We conclude that $L \\le \\pi$ for any minimizing geodesic. Since the diameter is the supremum of lengths of minimizing geodesics, $\\operatorname{diam}(M,g) \\le \\pi$.\n\n**Part 2: The general case with $k>0$**\n\nNow we consider the general case where $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g}\\left(v,v\\right) \\geq \\left(n-1\\right)k\\,g\\left(v,v\\right)$ for some constant $k>0$. We will rescale the metric $g$ to a new metric $g'$ to normalize the curvature bound, apply the result from Part 1, and then transfer the result back to the original metric $g$.\n\nLet $g' = \\alpha g$ for a constant $\\alpha > 0$ to be determined. We must analyze how the geometric quantities transform.\nThe Christoffel symbols are invariant under a constant scaling of the metric. This is because $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ij}^l = \\frac{1}{2} (g')^{lk} (\\partial_i g'_{jk} + \\partial_j g'_{ik} - \\partial_k g'_{ij}) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\frac{1}{\\alpha}g^{lk}) (\\alpha \\partial_i g_{jk} + \\alpha \\partial_j g_{ik} - \\alpha \\partial_k g_{ij}) = \\Gamma_{ij}^l$.\n\nSince the Riemann curvature tensor $R^l{}_{ijk}$ (type (1,3)) depends only on the Christoffel symbols and their derivatives, its components are invariant under this scaling: $R'^l{}_{ijk} = R^l{}_{ijk}$.\nThe Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$ (type (0,2)) components are given by the contraction $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = R^l{}_{ilj}$. Thus, the components of the Ricci tensor are also invariant under scaling: $\\operatorname{Ric}'_{ij} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the Ricci curvature as a quadratic form on tangent vectors. For a vector $v$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_{g'}(v,v) = \\operatorname{Ric}'_{ij}v^iv^j = \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}v^iv^j = \\operatorname{Ric}_g(v,v) $$\nHowever, the metric itself scales:\n$$ g'(v,v) = g'_{ij}v^iv^j = \\alpha g_{ij}v^iv^j = \\alpha g(v,v) $$\nWe are given the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g}\\left(v,v\\right) \\geq \\left(n-1\\right)k\\,g\\left(v,v\\right)$. We want to choose $\\alpha$ such that the new metric $g'$ satisfies the normalized condition $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g'}\\left(v,v\\right) \\geq \\left(n-1\\right) \\cdot 1 \\cdot g'\\left(v,v\\right)$.\nSubstituting our findings:\n$$ \\operatorname{Ric}_{g'}(v,v) = \\operatorname{Ric}_{g}(v,v) \\ge (n-1)k \\, g(v,v) $$\nWe need this to be greater than or equal to $(n-1)g'(v,v) = (n-1)\\alpha g(v,v)$. This requires:\n$$ (n-1)k \\, g(v,v) \\ge (n-1)\\alpha g(v,v) $$\nfor the comparison to hold. To make the bound tight and normalized (i.e., with constant $1$), we should have equality between the lower bounds:\n$$ (n-1)k \\, g(v,v) = (n-1)\\alpha g(v,v) $$\nThis implies we must choose $\\alpha = k$. So, the correctly scaled metric is $g' = k g$. With this choice, $(M, g')$ is a complete, connected Riemannian manifold satisfying $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g'} \\ge (n-1)g'$, which are the hypotheses of Part 1.\n\nThe length of a curve $\\gamma$ with respect to $g'$ is\n$$ L_{g'}(\\gamma) = \\int \\sqrt{g'(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})} dt = \\int \\sqrt{k g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})} dt = \\sqrt{k} \\int \\sqrt{g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})} dt = \\sqrt{k} L_g(\\gamma) $$\nSince distance is the infimum of curve lengths, the distances scale accordingly: $d_{g'}(p,q) = \\sqrt{k} d_g(p,q)$.\nConsequently, the diameters are related by $\\operatorname{diam}(M, g') = \\sqrt{k} \\operatorname{diam}(M, g)$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we know that for the manifold $(M, g')$, the diameter is bounded:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(M, g') \\le \\pi $$\nSubstituting the relation between the diameters:\n$$ \\sqrt{k} \\operatorname{diam}(M, g) \\le \\pi $$\nSince $k>0$, we can solve for the diameter with respect to the original metric $g$:\n$$ \\operatorname{diam}(M, g) \\le \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\nThis is the celebrated Bonnet-Myers diameter bound. This bound is known to be sharp; for instance, the $n$-sphere of radius $R=1/\\sqrt{k}$ has constant Ricci curvature $(n-1)k$ and diameter $\\pi R = \\pi/\\sqrt{k}$. Thus, this is the strongest possible upper bound.\nThe final expression for the upper bound on the diameter as a function of $k$ is $\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}}$$", "id": "3034293"}, {"introduction": "Having established the theorem, a natural question is whether the bound is sharp.

Verification of Smoothness**\n\nTo verify that the metric $g_k$ is smooth on the entire manifold $M^n$, including the poles $P_S$ and $P_N$, we must check the behavior of the warping function $f_k(t)$ at the endpoints of the interval $I$.\n\nA metric of the form $g=dt^2 + f(t)^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$ on $[0, a) \\times S^{n-1}$ extends smoothly to a metric on the $n$-disk $D^n$ (by collapsing the boundary $\\{0\\} \\times S^{n-1}$ to the origin) if and only if $f$ is a smooth function on $[0, a)$ satisfying:\n(i) $f(t) > 0$ for $t \\in (0, a)$,\n(ii) $f(0) = 0$,\n(iii) $f'(0) = 1$,\n(iv) all even-order derivatives of $f$ vanish at $t=0$, i.e., $f^{(2j)}(0)=0$ for all integers $j \\ge 0$. This is equivalent to $f$ being the restriction of a smooth, odd function defined on $(-a, a)$.\n\nLet's check these conditions for $f_k(t)$ at $t=0$.\nThe function $f_k(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$ is smooth for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n(i) For $t \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}})$, we have $\\sqrt{k}t \\in (0, \\pi)$, so $\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t) > 0$, and thus $f_k(t)>0$.\n(ii) $f_k(0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(0) = 0$.\n(iii) The first derivative is $f_k'(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} \\cdot \\sqrt{k}\\cos(\\sqrt{k}t) = \\cos(\\sqrt{k}t)$. At $t=0$, $f_k'(0) = \\cos(0) = 1$.\n(iv) The higher-order derivatives are $f_k^{(m)}(t) = k^{(m-1)/2} \\sin(\\sqrt{k}t + \\frac{(m-1)\\pi}{2})$ or similar forms. More easily, we see that $f_k''(t) = -\\sqrt{k}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$. In general, the even derivatives $f_k^{(2j)}(t)$ will be proportional to $\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$, while odd derivatives $f_k^{(2j+1)}(t)$ will be proportional to $\\cos(\\sqrt{k}t)$. Therefore, $f_k^{(2j)}(0)$ is always proportional to $\\sin(0) = 0$.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied at $t=0$, so the metric is smooth across the south pole $P_S$.\n\nNow, let's examine the north pole $P_N$ at $t = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$. We introduce a new coordinate $\\tau = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} - t$. As $t \\to \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$, we have $\\tau \\to 0^+$. The interval for $\\tau$ is $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}]$.\nIn terms of $\\tau$, the metric becomes $g_k = d\\tau^2 + f_k(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}-\\tau)^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$. Let's define a new warping function $\\tilde{f}_k(\\tau) = f_k(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}-\\tau)$.\n$$\n\\tilde{f}_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin\\left(\\sqrt{k}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}-\\tau\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\pi - \\sqrt{k}\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}\\tau)\n$$\nThis is exactly the same functional form as $f_k(t)$. Thus, $\\tilde{f}_k(\\tau)$ satisfies the same smoothness conditions at $\\tau=0$ as $f_k(t)$ does at $t=0$. The metric is therefore also smooth across the north pole $P_N$.\nThis completes the verification that $(M^n, g_k)$ is a smooth Riemannian manifold.\n\n**2. Computation of Ricci Curvature**\n\nWe will compute the sectional curvatures of $(M^n, g_k)$ first. For a warped product $I \\times_f S^{n-1}$, the sectional curvatures are given by two formulas.\nLet $X = \\partial_t$ be the unit vector field tangent to the base interval $I$. Let $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^{n-1}$ be a local orthonormal frame for the fiber $(S^{n-1}, g_{S^{n-1}})$. Then $\\{\\partial_t, \\frac{1}{f_k(t)}E_1, \\dots, \\frac{1}{f_k(t)}E_{n-1}\\}$ is a local orthonormal frame for $(M^n, g_k)$.\n\n(a) For a plane spanned by a vector tangent to the base and a vector tangent to the fiber, e.g., $\\partial_t$ and $\\frac{1}{f_k}E_i$, the sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK(\\partial_t, \\frac{1}{f_k}E_i) = -\\frac{f_k''(t)}{f_k(t)}\n$$\nWe compute the second derivative of $f_k(t)$:\n$f_k'(t) = \\cos(\\sqrt{k}t)$, and $f_k''(t) = -\\sqrt{k}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$.\nThis gives $f_k''(t) = -k \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)\\right) = -k f_k(t)$.\nSo, $\\frac{f_k''(t)}{f_k(t)} = -k$.\nThe sectional curvature is $K(\\partial_t, \\frac{1}{f_k}E_i) = -(-k) = k$.\n\n(b) For a plane spanned by two vectors tangent to the fiber, e.g., $\\frac{1}{f_k}E_i$ and $\\frac{1}{f_k}E_j$ for $i \\ne j$, the sectional curvature is:\n$$\nK(\\frac{1}{f_k}E_i, \\frac{1}{f_k}E_j) = \\frac{K_{\\text{fiber}} - (f_k'(t))^2}{f_k(t)^2}\n$$\nwhere $K_{\\text{fiber}}$ is the sectional curvature of the fiber. The fiber is the unit $(n-1)$-sphere, which has constant sectional curvature $K_{S^{n-1}} = 1$.\nUsing $f_k'(t) = \\cos(\\sqrt{k}t)$ and $f_k(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)$, we get:\n$$\nK(\\frac{1}{f_k}E_i, \\frac{1}{f_k}E_j) = \\frac{1 - \\cos^2(\\sqrt{k}t)}{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\sin(\\sqrt{k}t)\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sin^2(\\sqrt{k}t)}{\\frac{1}{k}\\sin^2(\\sqrt{k}t)} = k\n$$\nSince all sectional curvatures are constant and equal to $k$, $(M^n, g_k)$ is a space of constant curvature $k$.\nFor a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Ricci tensor is given by $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)K g$. In our case, $K=k$, so\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_k} = (n-1)k g_k\n$$\nThis shows that $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_k}\\ge (n-1)k g_k$ is satisfied (as an equality).\n\n**3. Computation of Diameter**\n\nThe diameter of a Riemannian manifold is the supremum of the geodesic distance over all pairs of points.\nLet $P_S$ and $P_N$ be the south and north poles of $M^n$, corresponding to $t=0$ and $t=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$, respectively. Let's compute the distance between them along a meridian. A meridian is a curve $\\gamma(t) = (t, \\sigma_0)$, where $\\sigma_0 \\in S^{n-1}$ is a fixed point. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\partial_t$.\nThe length of this curve is:\n$$\nL(\\gamma) = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/\\sqrt{k}} \\sqrt{g_k(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/\\sqrt{k}} \\sqrt{g_k(\\partial_t, \\partial_t)} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/\\sqrt{k}} \\sqrt{1} dt = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nThese meridional curves are geodesics. This can be seen from the fact that the Christoffel symbol component $\\Gamma_{tt}^k$ for the coordinate system $(t,\\sigma_1,...,\\sigma_{n-1})$ is zero.\nSo, the geodesic distance between $P_S$ and $P_N$ is $d(P_S, P_N) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$.

This exercise deepens your understanding by contrasting this case with other flat, yet compact, manifolds. [@problem_id:3034308]", "problem": "Let $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ denote Euclidean space with its standard flat Riemannian metric, so that the Ricci curvature satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$. Recall the following fundamental notions: for a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, the geodesic distance $d_g(x,y)$ between points $x,y\\in M$ is the infimum of lengths of piecewise smooth curves joining $x$ to $y$, and the diameter is $\\operatorname{diam}(M,g):=\\sup\\{d_g(x,y):x,y\\in M\\}$. The Hopf–Rinow theorem asserts that metric completeness is equivalent to geodesic completeness and to the compactness of closed metric balls. The Bonnet–Myers theorem asserts that a uniform strictly positive lower bound on the Ricci curvature, of the form $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge (n-1)k$ with $k0$, forces compactness and a finite upper bound on the diameter. Select all statements that correctly explain why $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ has infinite diameter and how this illustrates the necessity of strict positivity $k0$ in the Bonnet–Myers hypothesis.\n\nA. In $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ one has $d_{g_0}(x,y)=\\|x-y\\|$, so for any $R0$ there exist points $x,y$ with $d_{g_0}(x,y)=R$. Hence $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)=\\infty$. This shows that without a strictly positive lower bound on $\\operatorname{Ric}$ one cannot conclude a finite diameter.\n\nB.

Euclidean space is complete and has Ricci curvature $\\operatorname{Ric} \\equiv 0$, which satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge (n-1)k$ for $k=0$ but not for any $k>0$.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n**A. In $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ one has $d_{g_0}(x,y)=\\|x-y\\|$, so for any $R>0$ there exist points $x,y$ with $d_{g_0}(x,y)=R$. Hence $\\operatorname{diam}(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)=\\infty$. This shows that without a strictly positive lower bound on $\\operatorname{Ric}$ one cannot conclude a finite diameter.**\nThis statement is correct. The geodesic distance in Euclidean space is the standard Euclidean norm of the vector difference. Since we can find points arbitrarily far apart (e.g., the origin and a point on a sphere of radius $R$), the supremum of distances is infinite. As $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_0)$ satisfies $\\operatorname{Ric} \\ge 0$ but has an infinite diameter, it serves as a counterexample to any version of the Bonnet-Myers theorem that would try to relax the condition from $k>0$ to $k \\ge 0$.\n\n**B.

Euclidean space $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ is \"flat,\" meaning its sectional curvature is identically zero for all 2-planes at all points. The premise that $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ necessitates negative sectional curvature is false.\n\n**C. By the Hopf–Rinow theorem, geodesic completeness implies compactness of the manifold. Since $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ is geodesically complete, it must be compact, and hence it has finite diameter. The claim of infinite diameter therefore contradicts Hopf–Rinow.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It misrepresents the Hopf-Rinow theorem. The theorem states that a connected Riemannian manifold is complete if and only if every closed and bounded subset is compact. It does not state that the entire manifold is compact. $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_0)$ is a standard example of a manifold that is complete but not compact.\n\n**D. The failure of strict positivity is essential: there exist complete Riemannian manifolds with $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$ and infinite diameter, and $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ is a basic example.

It correctly identifies $(\\mathbb{R}^n,g_0)$ as an example of a manifold with $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$ and infinite diameter. Crucially, it contrasts this with another class of manifolds, flat tori, which also have $\\operatorname{Ric}\\equiv 0$ but are compact and have finite diameter. This comparison demonstrates that the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}\\ge 0$ alone is insufficient to determine whether the diameter is finite or infinite. Therefore, the strict inequality $k>0$ is the essential part of the hypothesis that forces the diameter to be finite.\n\n**E.

The Bonnet-Myers theorem applies only when the Ricci curvature is bounded below by a *strictly positive* constant, i.e., for $k>0$. The theorem makes no prediction for the case $k=0$.
