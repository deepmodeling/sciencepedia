A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to compute the scalar integral $B = \\int_{\\partial M} \\langle T,\\nu\\otimes X\\rangle\\, d\\sigma_{h}$. We are also asked to identify the pointwise value of the integrand on the boundary $\\partial M$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the integrand $\\langle T,\\nu\\otimes X\\rangle$. The Frobenius inner product of two $(1,1)$-tensors $A$ and $B$ is given by $\\langle A, B \\rangle = \\mathrm{tr}(A^T B)$, where $A^T$ is the metric adjoint of $A$. In an orthonormal basis, this corresponds to the sum of the products of their components. Let's work with the trace definition.\n\nThe tensor $T$ is the identity endomorphism, so for any vector field $Y$, $T(Y)=Y$. The identity endomorphism is self-adjoint, so $T^T=T=\\mathrm{Id}$.\nThe tensor $\\nu \\otimes X$ is the endomorphism that maps a vector $Y$ to $(\\nu \\otimes X)(Y) = g(X, Y)\\nu$.\n\nThe integrand is therefore $\\langle T, \\nu \\otimes X \\rangle = \\mathrm{tr}(T^T (\\nu \\otimes X)) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathrm{Id} (\\nu \\otimes X)) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\nu \\otimes X)$.\nThe trace of a tensor of the form $u \\otimes v$ (where $u$ is a vector and $v$ is a covector) is the contraction $v(u)$. Here, the covector is the one metrically dual to $X$, so the trace is $g(\\nu, X)$.\nThus, the integrand is $\\langle T, \\nu \\otimes X \\rangle = g(\\nu, X)$.\n\nThe problem asks to identify this boundary contribution pointwise. On the boundary $\\partial M = S^1$, a point $p$ has coordinates such that $|p|=1$. The position vector is $X(p) = p$. The outward-pointing unit normal vector field $\\nu$ at $p \\in S^1$ is also given by the position vector, so $\\nu(p) = p/|p| = p$.\nTherefore, pointwise on $\\partial M$, the integrand is:\n$$\ng(\\nu(p), X(p)) = g(p, p) = |p|^2 = 1^2 = 1\n$$\nThis is the pointwise value of the boundary contribution.\n\nWith this, the integral becomes $B = \\int_{\\partial M} 1 \\, d\\sigma_{h}$, which is simply the total arclength of the boundary $\\partial M = S^1$. The unit circle has radius $1$, so its circumference is $2\\pi r = 2\\pi(1) = 2\\pi$. Thus, $B=2\\pi$.\n\nHowever, the problem's constraints strongly suggest a derivation using the divergence of a tensor, avoiding a \"pre-packaged\" formula. This requires us to relate the boundary integral to an integral over the interior $M$ from first principles. The foundational theorem is the divergence theorem for a vector field $Y$ on $M$:\n$$\n\\int_{M} (\\mathrm{div}\\,Y) \\,d\\mu_g = \\int_{\\partial M} g(Y, \\nu) \\,d\\sigma_h\n$$\nTo connect this to the given tensors, we construct a suitable vector field from $T$ and $X$. A natural choice is $Y = T(X)$. Substituting $Y=T(X)$ into the divergence theorem gives:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\mathrm{div}(T(X)) \\,d\\mu_g = \\int_{\\partial M} g(T(X), \\nu) \\,d\\sigma_h\n$$\nWe now analyze the terms of this identity. The divergence of $T(X)$ can be expanded using the product rule for the covariant derivative $\\nabla$ (associated with the Levi-Civita connection of $g$). In index notation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{div}(T(X)) = \\nabla_i (T(X))^i = \\nabla_i (T^i_j X^j) = (\\nabla_i T^i_j) X^j + T^i_j (\\nabla_i X^j)\n$$\nThe first term, $(\\nabla_i T^i_j) X^j$, is the contraction of the divergence of $T$ (defined as the 1-form with components $(\\mathrm{div}\\,T)_j = \\nabla_i T^i_j$) with the vector field $X$.\nThe second term, $T^i_j (\\nabla_i X^j)$, can be identified as the Frobenius inner product $\\langle T, (\\nabla X)^T \\rangle = \\mathrm{tr}(T (\\nabla X))$, where $\\nabla X$ is the $(1,1)$-tensor field with components $(\\nabla X)^j_i = \\nabla_i X^j$.\n\nLet's apply this to the specific tensor $T=\\mathrm{Id}$ and vector field $X(p)=p$.\n$T$ is the identity, so its components in any chart are $T^i_j = \\delta^i_j$. Since the metric is compatible with the connection ($\\nabla g = 0$), the covariant derivative of the Kronecker delta is zero: $\\nabla_k \\delta^i_j=0$.\nThus, $(\\mathrm{div}\\,T)_j = \\nabla_i \\delta^i_j = 0$. The first term in the expansion of $\\mathrm{div}(T(X))$ vanishes.\nThe second term becomes $\\delta^i_j (\\nabla_i X^j) = \\nabla_i X^i = \\mathrm{div}(X)$.\nSo, for $T=\\mathrm{Id}$, we have $\\mathrm{div}(T(X)) = \\mathrm{div}(X)$.\n\nThe divergence theorem for $Y=T(X)=X$ therefore reads:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\mathrm{div}(X) \\,d\\mu_g = \\int_{\\partial M} g(X, \\nu) \\,d\\sigma_h\n$$\nThe integral we want to compute is $B = \\int_{\\partial M} g(\\nu, X) \\, d\\sigma_h$. Since the metric $g$ is symmetric, $g(\\nu, X) = g(X, \\nu)$, so our desired integral $B$ is precisely the right-hand side of this equation.\n\nTo find $B$, we can compute the left-hand side. We need to find $\\mathrm{div}(X)$. The vector field is $X(p)=p$. In standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, x^2)$ for $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we have $X = x^1 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^1} + x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^2}$, so $X^i = x^i$.\nThe metric $g$ is the flat Euclidean metric, so the Christoffel symbols are zero, and the covariant derivatives are just the partial derivatives, $\\nabla_i = \\partial_i$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{div}(X) = \\nabla_i X^i = \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\frac{\\partial X^i}{\\partial x^i} = \\frac{\\partial x^1}{\\partial x^1} + \\frac{\\partial x^2}{\\partial x^2} = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nThe divergence of the position vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the constant $2$.\n\nNow we compute the integral over the manifold $M$:\n$$\n\\int_{M} \\mathrm{div}(X) \\,d\\mu_g = \\int_{M} 2 \\,d\\mu_g = 2 \\int_{M} d\\mu_g = 2 \\cdot (\\text{Area of } M)\n$$\nThe manifold $M$ is the closed unit disk of radius $r=1$. Its area is $\\pi r^2 = \\pi(1)^2 = \\pi$.\nTherefore, the integral is $2\\pi$.\n\nEquating the sides of the divergence theorem, we have:\n$$\nB = \\int_{\\partial M} g(\\nu, X) \\,d\\sigma_h = \\int_{M} \\mathrm{div}(X) \\,d\\mu_g = 2\\pi\n$$\nThis confirms the result obtained by direct evaluation of the boundary integral. The derivation follows the constraints of the problem by building the argument from the foundational divergence theorem for vector fields.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address each in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the geodesic curvature $k_g$.\n\nLet $M$ be the upper hemisphere of the unit $2$-sphere $S^2$, defined by $S^2 = \\{ (x,y,z) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 : x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1 \\}$ and $M = \\{ (x,y,z) \\in S^2 : z \\ge 0 \\}$. The boundary $\\partial M$ is the equator, a circle $C = \\{ (x,y,z) \\in S^2 : z = 0 \\}$. $M$ is endowed with the Riemannian metric induced from the Euclidean inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nThe boundary curve $C$ can be parameterized by its arc length $s$. A suitable parameterization is $\\gamma(s) = (\\cos(s), \\sin(s), 0)$ for $s \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The unit tangent vector to the curve $C$ is given by the derivative with respect to arc length:\n$$ T(s) = \\gamma'(s) = (-\\sin(s), \\cos(s), 0) $$\nThe acceleration vector of the curve in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is:\n$$ \\gamma''(s) = (-\\cos(s), -\\sin(s), 0) = -\\gamma(s) $$\nFor any point $p \\in M$, the outward unit normal vector to the surface $M$ is given by the position vector of the point itself, since $M$ is a subset of the unit sphere centered at the origin. So, at a point $p=\\gamma(s)$ on the boundary $C$, the unit normal vector $\\nu$ to the surface $M$ is:\n$$ \\nu(s) = \\gamma(s) = (\\cos(s), \\sin(s), 0) $$\nThe acceleration vector $\\gamma''(s)$ can be decomposed into its component normal to the surface and its component tangent to the surface. The tangential component is the covariant derivative of $T$ along $T$, denoted $\\nabla_T T$.\n$$ \\gamma''(s) = (\\gamma''(s))^{\\perp} + (\\gamma''(s))^{\\top} $$\nwhere $(\\gamma''(s))^{\\perp} = \\langle \\gamma''(s), \\nu(s) \\rangle \\nu(s)$ is the component normal to the surface, and $(\\gamma''(s))^{\\top} = \\nabla_T T$ is the component tangent to the surface.\n\nLet's compute the inner product $\\langle \\gamma''(s), \\nu(s) \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\gamma''(s), \\nu(s) \\rangle = \\langle -\\gamma(s), \\gamma(s) \\rangle = -|\\gamma(s)|^2 = -1 $$\nwhere $|\\gamma(s)|=1$ because it lies on the unit sphere.\nNow we can compute the covariant derivative $\\nabla_T T$:\n$$ \\nabla_T T = \\gamma''(s) - \\langle \\gamma''(s), \\nu(s) \\rangle \\nu(s) = -\\gamma(s) - (-1)\\gamma(s) = -\\gamma(s) + \\gamma(s) = 0 $$\nThe geodesic curvature $k_g$ is defined by the relation $\\nabla_T T = k_g n$, where $n$ is the unit co-normal vector, which is tangent to $M$ and orthogonal to $T$. Since $\\nabla_T T = 0$, we have $k_g n = 0$. As $n$ is a unit vector, $|n|=1$, this implies that the geodesic curvature must be zero.\n$$ k_g = 0 $$\nThis result is expected, as the equator $C$ is a great circle on the sphere $S^2$, and great circles are the geodesics of the sphere. By definition, geodesics have zero geodesic curvature.\n\nPart 2: Computation of the quantity $S$.\n\nThe quantity $S$ is defined as:\n$$ S = \\int_{M} K \\, dA + \\int_{\\partial M} k_{g} \\, ds $$\nFrom Part 1, we found that the geodesic curvature $k_g = 0$ along the entire boundary $\\partial M = C$. Therefore, the boundary integral vanishes:\n$$ \\int_{\\partial M} k_{g} \\, ds = \\int_{C} 0 \\, ds = 0 $$\nThe expression for $S$ simplifies to the integral of the Gaussian curvature $K$ over the hemisphere $M$:\n$$ S = \\int_{M} K \\, dA $$\nThe Gaussian curvature $K$ of a sphere of radius $R$ is constant and is given by $K = 1/R^2$. For the unit sphere $S^2$, the radius is $R=1$, so the Gaussian curvature is $K=1$ everywhere on $S^2$, and thus everywhere on $M \\subset S^2$.\nSubstituting $K=1$ into the integral for $S$:\n$$ S = \\int_{M} 1 \\, dA = \\text{Area}(M) $$\nThe manifold $M$ is the upper hemisphere of a unit sphere. The total surface area of a sphere of radius $R$ is $4\\pi R^2$. For the unit sphere ($R=1$), the total area is $4\\pi$. The area of the hemisphere $M$ is half of the total area.\n$$ \\text{Area}(M) = \\frac{1}{2} (4\\pi(1)^2) = 2\\pi $$\nTherefore, the value of $S$ is:\n$$ S = 2\\pi $$\n\nPart 3: Euler characteristic and verification.\n\nThe problem asks to determine the Euler characteristic $\\chi(M)$ of the hemisphere $M$ and verify the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The manifold $M$ is the closed upper hemisphere, which is topologically equivalent to a closed disk. A closed disk is a contractible space. The Euler characteristic of any contractible space, such as a point or a disk, is $1$. This can be seen by considering a simple triangulation of a disk, for example, a triangle, which has $V=3$ vertices, $E=3$ edges, and $F=1$ face. The Euler characteristic is $\\chi = V - E + F = 3 - 3 + 1 = 1$. So, for the hemisphere $M$:\n$$ \\chi(M) = 1 $$\nThe Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a compact, oriented $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ with boundary $\\partial M$ states that:\n$$ \\int_{M} K \\, dA + \\int_{\\partial M} k_{g} \\, ds = 2\\pi \\chi(M) $$\nThe left-hand side of this equation is precisely the quantity $S$ we computed in Part 2.\n$$ S = \\int_{M} K \\, dA + \\int_{\\partial M} k_{g} \\, ds = 2\\pi $$\nThe right-hand side of the theorem is:\n$$ 2\\pi \\chi(M) = 2\\pi (1) = 2\\pi $$\nComparing the two sides, we find $2\\pi = 2\\pi$, which verifies the expected relationship given by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for the specific case of the hemisphere.\n\nThe question asks for the final result for $S$.

This is a classic example of a free boundary minimal hypersurface.\n\nThe Morse index is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Jacobi operator associated with the second variation of the area functional.\n\n### Step 1: The Second Variation Formula\nThe general second variation formula for the area of a minimal hypersurface $\\Sigma$ in a Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ under a normal variation $u\\nu$ is given by the index form:\n$$ Q(u,u) = \\int_{\\Sigma} \\left( |\\nabla_\\Sigma u|^2 - (\\text{Ric}_M(\\nu, \\nu) + |A_\\Sigma|^2) u^2 \\right) dV_\\Sigma - \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma} h_{\\partial M}(\\nu, \\nu) u^2 dS_{\\partial \\Sigma} $$\nwhere:\n- $u$ is a smooth function on $\\Sigma$.\n- $\\nu$ is a unit normal vector field to $\\Sigma$.\n- $A_\\Sigma$ is the second fundamental form of $\\Sigma$ in $M$.\n- $\\text{Ric}_M$ is the Ricci curvature of the ambient manifold $M$.\n- $h_{\\partial M}$ is the second fundamental form of the boundary $\\partial M$, with respect to the outward-pointing normal.\n\n### Step 2: Specializing the Formula to the Given Problem\nWe specialize this formula to our a setup:\n1.  **Ambient Manifold**: $M = B^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. Since the ambient space is Euclidean, its curvature is zero. Thus, $\\text{Ric}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(\\nu, \\nu) = 0$.\n2.  **Minimal Hypersurface**: $\\Sigma = B^n \\cap \\{x_n = 0\\}$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional flat disk. Since it is flat, its second fundamental form $A_\\Sigma$ is identically zero, so $|A_\\Sigma|^2 = 0$.\n3.  **Boundary Term**: The boundary of the ambient manifold is $\\partial M = S^{n-1}$. Let $\\eta$ be the outward unit normal to $S^{n-1}$ at a point $p \\in S^{n-1}$. For the unit sphere centered at the origin, $\\eta(p) = p$. The second fundamental form of $S^{n-1}$ is given by $h_{S^{n-1}}(X, Y) = \\langle \\nabla_X \\eta, Y \\rangle$. In Euclidean space, $\\nabla_X \\eta = \\nabla_X p = X$. Therefore, for vectors $X, Y$ tangent to $S^{n-1}$, $h_{S^{n-1}}(X, Y) = \\langle X, Y \\rangle$.\n    The normal to our disk $\\Sigma$ is $\\nu = e_n = (0, \\dots, 0, 1)$. At any point $p \\in \\partial\\Sigma = S^{n-2} \\subset \\{x_n=0\\}$, the position vector is $p=(p_1, \\dots, p_{n-1}, 0)$. The inner product $\\langle \\nu, \\eta(p) \\rangle = \\langle e_n, p \\rangle = 0$, which means that the normal vector $\\nu$ to the disk is tangent to the sphere $S^{n-1}$ at every point along the boundary of the disk.\n    We can thus evaluate $h_{S^{n-1}}(\\nu, \\nu) = \\langle \\nu, \\nu \\rangle = |e_n|^2 = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these components into the index form, we obtain:\n$$ Q(u,u) = \\int_{\\Sigma} |\\nabla_\\Sigma u|^2 dV_\\Sigma - \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma} u^2 dS_{\\partial \\Sigma} $$\n\n### Step 3: The Associated Eigenvalue Problem\nTo find the eigenvalues of the index form, we identify the associated Jacobi operator and boundary condition. We use integration by parts (Green's first identity) on the first term:\n$$ \\int_{\\Sigma} |\\nabla_\\Sigma u|^2 dV_\\Sigma = \\int_{\\Sigma} u(-\\Delta_\\Sigma u) dV_\\Sigma + \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma} u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mu} dS_{\\partial \\Sigma} $$\nHere, $\\Delta_\\Sigma$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $\\Sigma$, and $\\mu$ is the outward-pointing unit normal to $\\partial \\Sigma$ within $\\Sigma$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $Q(u,u)$:\n$$ Q(u,u) = \\int_{\\Sigma} u(-\\Delta_\\Sigma u) dV_\\Sigma + \\int_{\\partial \\Sigma} u \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mu} - u \\right) dS_{\\partial \\Sigma} $$\nThe second variation corresponds to an eigenvalue problem for the Jacobi operator $L = -\\Delta_\\Sigma$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found by solving the equation $L(u) = \\lambda u$ for functions $u$ which cause the boundary term in the variation of $Q$ to vanish. This gives the natural boundary condition. The problem for finding the spectrum of the index form is therefore:\n$$ -\\Delta_\\Sigma u = \\lambda u \\quad \\text{in } \\Sigma $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\mu} = u \\quad \\text{on } \\partial \\Sigma $$\nThe Morse index is the number of negative eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of this boundary value problem.\n\n### Step 4: Spectral Analysis\nWe solve the eigenvalue problem on the $(n-1)$-dimensional disk $\\Sigma = D^{n-1}$. We use separation of variables in polar coordinates, $u(r, \\theta) = R(r) Y_k(\\theta)$, where $Y_k$ is a spherical harmonic of degree $k$ on the sphere $S^{n-2}$. Spherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on the sphere: $-\\Delta_{S^{n-2}} Y_k = k(k+n-3)Y_k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nThe radial part $R(r)$ must satisfy the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ r^2 R'' + (n-2)r R' + (\\lambda r^2 - k(k+n-3))R = 0 $$\nand must be regular at $r=0$. The general regular solution is of the form $R(r) = C r^{\\alpha} J_{\\beta}(\\sqrt{\\lambda}r)$, where $J_\\beta$ is the Bessel function of the first kind. Through a standard change of variables, one can show that the solution regular at the origin is\n$$ R(r) = C r^{(3-n)/2} J_{k+(n-3)/2}(\\sqrt{\\lambda}r) $$\nLet $\\alpha = (3-n)/2$ and $\\beta = k + (n-3)/2$. The solution is $R(r) = C r^\\alpha J_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda} r)$.\n\nThe boundary condition on $\\partial\\Sigma$ (where $r=1$) is $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} = u$, which implies $R'(1) = R(1)$.\n$$ R'(r) = C \\left( \\alpha r^{\\alpha-1} J_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda}r) + r^\\alpha J'_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda}r)\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\right) $$\nAt $r=1$, this gives $R'(1) = C (\\alpha J_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) + \\sqrt{\\lambda} J'_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda}))$.\nSetting $R'(1) = R(1) = C J_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda})$, we get:\n$$ \\alpha J_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) + \\sqrt{\\lambda} J'_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = J_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) $$\n$$ \\sqrt{\\lambda} J'_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = (1-\\alpha) J_\\beta(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) $$\nSubstituting $\\alpha = (3-n)/2$, we have $1-\\alpha = 1 - (3-n)/2 = (n-1)/2$.\nThe eigenvalue condition is:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\lambda} J'_{\\beta}(\\sqrt{\\lambda}) = \\frac{n-1}{2} J_{\\beta}(\\sqrt{\\lambda}), \\quad \\text{where } \\beta = k + \\frac{n-3}{2} $$\nWe are looking for negative eigenvalues, so let $\\lambda = -\\gamma^2$ for $\\gamma > 0$. Let $s = \\sqrt{\\lambda} = i\\gamma$. Using the relation $J_\\nu(iz) = i^\\nu I_\\nu(z)$ (where $I_\\nu$ is the modified Bessel function), the condition becomes:\n$$ i\\gamma \\cdot i^{\\beta-1} I'_\\beta(\\gamma) = \\frac{n-1}{2} \\cdot i^\\beta I_\\beta(\\gamma) \\implies \\gamma I'_\\beta(\\gamma) = \\frac{n-1}{2} I_\\beta(\\gamma) $$\nUsing the recurrence relation $\\gamma I'_\\beta(\\gamma) = \\beta I_\\beta(\\gamma) + \\gamma I_{\\beta+1}(\\gamma)$:\n$$ \\beta I_\\beta(\\gamma) + \\gamma I_{\\beta+1}(\\gamma) = \\frac{n-1}{2} I_\\beta(\\gamma) $$\n$$ \\gamma I_{\\beta+1}(\\gamma) = \\left(\\frac{n-1}{2} - \\beta\\right) I_\\beta(\\gamma) $$\nSubstituting $\\beta = k + \\frac{n-3}{2}$:\n$$ \\frac{n-1}{2} - \\beta = \\frac{n-1}{2} - \\left(k + \\frac{n-3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{n-1-2k-n+3}{2} = \\frac{2-2k}{2} = 1-k $$\nSo the final condition for a negative eigenvalue is:\n$$ \\gamma I_{k+(n-1)/2}(\\gamma) = (1-k) I_{k+(n-3)/2}(\\gamma) $$\nWe analyze this condition for different integer values of $k \\ge 0$:\n-   **Case $k=0$**: $\\gamma I_{(n-1)/2}(\\gamma) = I_{(n-3)/2}(\\gamma)$. Let $\\nu = (n-3)/2$. The function $h(\\gamma) = \\gamma \\frac{I_{\\nu+1}(\\gamma)}{I_\\nu(\\gamma)}$ is strictly increasing for $\\gamma > 0$ from $h(0)=0$ to $h(\\infty)=\\infty$, provided $\\nu \\ge -1/2$ (which is true for $n\\ge 2$). Therefore, the equation $h(\\gamma)=1$ has exactly one solution $\\gamma_0>0$. This corresponds to one negative eigenvalue. The eigenfunction is radial, so its multiplicity is 1.\n\n-   **Case $k=1$**: $\\gamma I_{(n+1)/2}(\\gamma) = (1-1) I_{(n-1)/2}(\\gamma) = 0$. For $\\gamma>0$, both $\\gamma$ and the modified Bessel function $I_{(n+1)/2}(\\gamma)$ are strictly positive. Thus, there is no solution for $\\gamma>0$. This means there are no negative eigenvalues for $k=1$. (In fact, for $k=1$, the eigenvalue is $\\lambda=0$, corresponding to rotations of the disk).\n\n-   **Case $k \\ge 2$**: The equation is $\\gamma I_{k+(n-1)/2}(\\gamma) = (1-k) I_{k+(n-3)/2}(\\gamma)$. For $\\gamma>0$, the left-hand side is strictly positive. The right-hand side is strictly negative since $1-k  0$ and the Bessel function is positive. Thus, there are no solutions for $k \\ge 2$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that there is a negative eigenvalue only for the mode $k=0$. This eigenvalue is unique and the corresponding eigenspace is one-dimensional (spanned by a radial function). Therefore, the total number of negative eigenvalues, which is the Morse index of the flat disk, is 1.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "3032054"}]}
