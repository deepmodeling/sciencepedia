Thus, there is no positive time $t_c$ for which a non-trivial Jacobi field vanishes.

So, the solution must be of the form $y(t) = B \\sinh(\\kappa t)$.\nFor a non-trivial solution, we need $B \\neq 0$, which corresponds to $y'(0) = B\\kappa \\neq 0$.\nThe second condition is $y(t_c) = 0$ for some $t_c > 0$. This gives $B \\sinh(\\kappa t_c) = 0$.\nSince $B \\neq 0$, we must have $\\sinh(\\kappa t_c) = 0$. The hyperbolic sine function $\\sinh(x)$ is zero only when its argument $x$ is zero. Thus, we need $\\kappa t_c = 0$.\nSince $\\kappa = \\sqrt{-k} > 0$, this implies $t_c=0$. As in the Euclidean case, this does not satisfy the requirement $t_c > 0$. There are no conjugate points along any geodesic in hyperbolic space.\nThe first conjugate time is therefore $t_c = +\\infty$.\n\nIn summary, the first conjugate times for the three model spaces are:\n- For $\\mathbb{S}^{n}_{k}$ ($k>0$): $t_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}}$\n- For $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($k=0$): $t_c = \\infty$\n- For $\\mathbb{H}^{n}_{k}$ ($k<0$): $t_c = \\infty$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{k}} & \\infty & \\infty\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3036455"}, {"introduction": "The power of the Rauch Comparison Theorem lies not just in its inequalities, but in its 'rigidity' statement: when does equality of Jacobi fields imply equality of curvature?

We have $k_{1}=1  k_{2}=4$. To achieve equality of norms $\\|J_{1}(t_{0})\\|=\\|J_{2}(t_{0})\\|$, we had to choose initial conditions such that $v_{2} = v_{1}\\sec(t_{0})$.

The fundamental premise for the comparison theorem, $\\|J_{1}'(0)\\| = \\|J_{2}'(0)\\|$, is broken.\n\n    Intuitively, the higher curvature $k_{2}=4$ exerts a stronger focusing effect, which would naturally make $\\|J_{2}(t)\\|$ smaller than $\\|J_{1}(t)\\|$ if they started with the same initial velocity ($v_1=v_2$). We have counteracted this by giving the Jacobi field $J_2$ a larger initial \"separation velocity\" ($v_2 > v_1$), allowing its norm to match the norm of $J_1$ at the single instant $t_0$. The problem thus demonstrates that if the initial conditions are not identical, equality of norms at a single point does not imply equality of curvatures.\n\n2.  **Additional hypotheses for rigidity:**\n    For the conclusion of rigidity (i.e., $k_{1}=k_{2}$) to follow from an equality of Jacobi field norms, the full hypotheses of the Rauch Comparison Theorem must be satisfied.
