Let $M$ be a complete Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $K$ satisfying $K \\ge \\kappa$. Let $M_{\\kappa}$ be the simply connected $2$-dimensional space form with constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$.

The length of the side opposite $\\gamma$ in $\\Delta_0$ is denoted by $c_0$. According to the Toponogov theorem, we have the relationship $c \\le c_0$. The problem requires the computation of the exact difference $c_0 - c$.\n\nTo find $c_0$ and $c$, we use the law of cosines appropriate for each space.\n\nFirst, we compute the length $c_0$ in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.

Toponogov's angle comparison theorem states that for a geodesic triangle $\\Delta pqr$ in a manifold $M$ with sectional curvature $K_M \\ge 1$, its angles are greater than or equal to the corresponding angles of the comparison triangle in $S^2$. Thus, the angle at $p$ in $M$ must satisfy:\n$$\\angle qpr \\ge \\angle_p = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$\nTo see the full implication, we compute the other angles of the comparison triangle. Since the triangle is isosceles ($b=c$), the angles at $\\tilde{q}$ and $\\tilde{r}$ (say, $B$ and $C$) are equal.

A calculation shows this sum is exactly $2\\pi$. Specifically, if $\\beta = \\arccos(-1/\\sqrt{3})$, then $\\cos(2\\beta) = 2\\cos^2(\\beta)-1 = 2(1/3)-1 = -1/3$. Since $\\beta \\in (\\pi/2, \\pi)$, then $2\\beta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$. The angle $\\theta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$ with $\\cos(\\theta)=-1/3$ is $2\\pi - \\arccos(-1/3) = 2\\pi - A$. Thus $2\\beta = 2\\pi - A$, or $A+2B = 2\\pi$.\n\nBy Toponogov's theorem, the sum of the angles of the geodesic triangle $\\Delta pqr$ in $M$, denoted $S_M$, must satisfy:\n$$S_M = \\angle qpr + \\angle pqr + \\angle prq \\ge A+B+C = 2\\pi$$\nHowever, the sum of angles of any non-degenerate geodesic triangle cannot exceed $2\\pi$. This forces the equality $S_M = 2\\pi$. The rigidity case of Toponogov's theorem then implies that the triangle $\\Delta pqr$ must be isometric to the comparison triangle, which is a totally geodesic hemisphere of radius 1.\n\nThe existence of such a \"maximal\" triangle places an enormous constraint on the structure of $M$. In proofs like the Grove-Shiohama theorem, one shows that if the manifold were not topologically a sphere, certain geometric configurations could be constructed. The analysis above demonstrates that a configuration of three points with the given pairwise distances is impossible in a manifold with $K_M \\ge 1$ unless it contains a totally geodesic hemisphere.
