It is well-posed, with all terms clearly defined within the standard corpus of differential geometry. The tasks are specific, objective, and lead to a unique, verifiable solution. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It serves as a canonical example to illustrate the mechanics of Busemann functions and the Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem, which is a non-trivial and important result. Therefore, the problem is not pseudo-profound or trivial in its pedagogical context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**1. Verification of Hypotheses for the Splitting Theorem**\n\nWe first verify that $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n},g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}\\right)$ satisfies the conditions of the Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem.\n\n-   **Completeness**: The metric space $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, d_{\\mathrm{eucl}}\\right)$ is complete; every Cauchy sequence converges to a point in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. By the Hopf–Rinow theorem, a Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete if and only if it is complete as a metric space. Thus, $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n},g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}\\right)$ is a complete Riemannian manifold.\n\n-   **Non-negative Ricci Curvature**: The standard Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$ is flat. This means its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero, $R(X,Y)Z = 0$ for all vector fields $X, Y, Z$. The Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z)$, is defined as the trace of the linear map $X \\mapsto R(X,Y)Z$. Since the curvature tensor is zero, the Ricci tensor is also identically zero: $\\mathrm{Ric} \\equiv 0$. A zero tensor is trivially non-negative, i.e., $\\mathrm{Ric}(X,X) = 0 \\ge 0$ for any tangent vector $X$.\n\n-   **Existence of a Line**: A line is a complete unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma: \\mathbb{R} \\to M$ such that $d(\\gamma(s),\\gamma(t)) = |s-t|$ for all $s,t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Let's extend the given ray $\\gamma_{+}$ to the curve $\\gamma(t) = t\\,e_{n}$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    -   Its velocity vector is $\\gamma'(t) = e_{n}$. The speed is $||\\gamma'(t)||_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}} = ||e_{n}|| = 1$, so it is unit-speed.\n    -   The geodesics in Euclidean space are straight lines. The geodesic equation is $\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}\\gamma'(t)=0$. Since the Christoffel symbols for $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$ in Cartesian coordinates are all zero ($\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}=0$), the geodesic equation simplifies to $\\gamma''(t) = 0$. For $\\gamma(t) = t\\,e_{n}$, we have $\\gamma''(t) = 0$, so it is a geodesic.\n    -   The distance is $d(\\gamma(s),\\gamma(t)) = ||\\gamma(s) - \\gamma(t)|| = ||s\\,e_{n} - t\\,e_{n}|| = ||(s-t)e_{n}|| = |s-t|\\,||e_{n}|| = |s-t|$.\n    -   Since the domain is $\\mathbb{R}$, this is a complete geodesic, and it satisfies the distance property. Hence, $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n},g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}\\right)$ contains a line.\n\nAll three hypotheses of the Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem are satisfied.\n\n**2. Computation of the Busemann Function**\n\nWe compute $b(x) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\left(t-d\\!\\left(x,\\gamma_{+}(t)\\right)\\right)$. Let $x = (x_{1},\\dots,x_{n})$. The point on the ray is $\\gamma_{+}(t)=(0,\\dots,0,t)$. The distance $d$ is the standard Euclidean distance:\n$$\nd(x, \\gamma_{+}(t)) = \\sqrt{(x_{1}-0)^{2} + \\dots + (x_{n-1}-0)^{2} + (x_{n}-t)^{2}} = \\sqrt{x_{1}^{2} + \\dots + x_{n-1}^{2} + (x_{n}-t)^{2}}\n$$\nLet $R^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i^2$. The distance becomes $d(x, \\gamma_{+}(t)) = \\sqrt{R^{2} + (t-x_{n})^{2}}$. We now evaluate the limit:\n$$\nb(x) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left( t - \\sqrt{R^{2} + t^{2} - 2tx_{n} + x_{n}^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nTo resolve the indeterminate form $\\infty - \\infty$, we multiply by the conjugate:\n$$\nb(x) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\left( t - \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2tx_{n} + R^{2} + x_{n}^{2}} \\right) \\left( t + \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2tx_{n} + R^{2} + x_{n}^{2}} \\right)}{t + \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2tx_{n} + R^{2} + x_{n}^{2}}}\n$$\nThe numerator simplifies to:\n$$\nt^{2} - \\left(t^{2} - 2tx_{n} + R^{2} + x_{n}^{2}\\right) = 2tx_{n} - R^{2} - x_{n}^{2}\n$$\nSo we have:\n$$\nb(x) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{2tx_{n} - R^{2} - x_{n}^{2}}{t + \\sqrt{t^{2} - 2tx_{n} + R^{2} + x_{n}^{2}}}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $t$:\n$$\nb(x) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{2x_{n} - \\frac{R^{2} + x_{n}^{2}}{t}}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2x_{n}}{t} + \\frac{R^{2} + x_{n}^{2}}{t^{2}}}}\n$$\nAs $t\\to\\infty$, the terms with $t$ in the denominator go to $0$:\n$$\nb(x) = \\frac{2x_{n} - 0}{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 0 + 0}} = \\frac{2x_{n}}{1+1} = x_{n}\n$$\nThus, the Busemann function is $b(x) = x_{n}$.\n\n**3. Properties of $b(x)$**\n\nWith $b(x) = x_{n}$, we analyze its gradient and Hessian.\n\n-   **Gradient**: The gradient of $b$ in Euclidean coordinates is $\\nabla b = \\left(\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x_{1}}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x_{n}}\\right)$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x_{i}} = \\frac{\\partial x_{n}}{\\partial x_{i}} = \\delta_{in}\n    $$\n    where $\\delta_{in}$ is the Kronecker delta. Therefore, $\\nabla b = (0, \\dots, 0, 1) = e_{n}$.\n    The length of the gradient is $||\\nabla b||_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}} = ||e_{n}|| = 1$. This length is constant.\n\n-   **Hessian**: The Hessian, $\\nabla^{2}b$, is the matrix of second partial derivatives, $(\\nabla^{2}b)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}b}{\\partial x_{i} \\partial x_{j}}$.\n    $$\n    (\\nabla^{2}b)_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{i}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x_{j}}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{i}}(\\delta_{jn}) = 0\n    $$\n    Since all second partial derivatives are zero, the Hessian tensor $\\nabla^{2}b$ is identically zero. This confirms that $b(x)$ is an affine function.\n\n-   **Level Sets and Totally Geodesic Hypersurfaces**: The level sets of $b$ are defined by $b(x) = c$ for some constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This gives the equation $x_{n} = c$.\n    This equation describes an $(n-1)$-dimensional hyperplane in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ parallel to the coordinate plane spanned by $\\{e_{1}, \\dots, e_{n-1}\\}$. Each such hyperplane is isometric to $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.\n    To show a level set $S_c = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mid x_{n}=c\\}$ is totally geodesic, we must show that any geodesic of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ that is initially tangent to $S_c$ remains in $S_c$. Let $\\alpha(s)$ be a geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $\\alpha(0) = p \\in S_c$ and $\\alpha'(0) = v \\in T_{p}S_c$. In Euclidean space, geodesics are straight lines, so $\\alpha(s) = p + s\\,v$.\n    The tangent space $T_{p}S_c$ is the set of vectors orthogonal to the normal vector of the hyperplane, which is $e_n$. Thus, a vector $v=(v_1, \\dots, v_n)$ is in $T_p S_c$ if and only if $v_n = 0$.\n    The $n$-th coordinate of the geodesic path is $\\alpha_{n}(s) = p_{n} + s\\,v_{n}$. Since $p \\in S_c$, we have $p_{n}=c$. Since $v \\in T_p S_c$, we have $v_n=0$. Therefore, $\\alpha_{n}(s) = c + s \\cdot 0 = c$ for all $s \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    This shows that the geodesic $\\alpha(s)$ remains entirely within the level set $S_c$. Hence, the level sets of $b$ are totally geodesic hypersurfaces.\n\n**4. Conclusion via the Cheeger–Gromoll Splitting Theorem**\n\nThe Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem states that any complete Riemannian manifold $(M^n,g)$ with non-negative Ricci curvature that contains a line must be isometrically a product $M \\cong N \\times \\mathbb{R}$, where $N$ is an $(n-1)$-dimensional complete manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature.\n\nOur results directly illustrate this theorem for $M = \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n1.  We verified in Part 1 that $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n},g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}\\right)$ satisfies all the hypotheses of the theorem. The theorem thus guarantees that $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ splits isometrically.\n2.  The proof of the theorem shows that the Busemann function $b$ associated with any line is an affine function (i.e., $\\nabla^2 b=0$). Our computation in Part 3, showing $\\nabla^2 b = 0$ for $b(x)=x_n$, confirms this for our specific case.\n3.  The theorem's proof constructs the isometry. The manifold $N$ is given by any level set of the Busemann function, and the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor is parametrized by the Busemann function itself. Our work shows this explicitly:\n    -   The level sets $b(x) = c$ are the hyperplanes $x_n = c$, each isometric to $\\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. This is our manifold $N$.\n    -   The coordinate along the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor is given by the value of $b(x) = x_n$.\n4.  The isometry $\\Phi: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is given by $\\Phi(x) = ((x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1}), b(x)) = ((x_1, \\dots, x_{n-1}), x_n)$. This is the identity map, which is trivially an isometry from $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}\\right)$ to $\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{R}, g_{\\mathrm{eucl}} \\times g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}\\right)$.\n\nIn summary, by explicitly calculating the Busemann function and its properties for a line in Euclidean space, we have carried out the concrete steps that mirror the abstract proof of the splitting theorem, thereby verifying its conclusion for this fundamental example.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x_{n}}$$", "id": "3034418"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the Euclidean case, we now turn to a manifold that is already presented as a product: the cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$.

It is a standard problem in Riemannian geometry.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four steps as requested by the prompt.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the distance function**\n\nLet $p_1 = (\\theta_1, t_1)$ and $p_2 = (\\theta_2, t_2)$ be two arbitrary points in the Riemannian product manifold $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$, equipped with the product metric $g = g_{S^{1}} \\oplus dt^{2}$. The distance $d(p_1, p_2)$ is defined as the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise differentiable curves connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$.\nLet $\\alpha: [a,b] \\to M$ be such a curve, written in terms of its component functions as $\\alpha(u) = (\\alpha_1(u), \\alpha_2(u))$, where $\\alpha_1: [a,b] \\to S^1$ and $\\alpha_2: [a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R}$. The tangent vector is $\\alpha'(u) = (\\alpha_1'(u), \\alpha_2'(u))$. The length of $\\alpha$ is given by\n$$L(\\alpha) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\|\\alpha_1'(u)\\|_{g_{S^1}}^2 + |\\alpha_2'(u)|_{dt^2}^2} \\, du$$\nBy the Minkowski inequality for integrals (a consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality), we have:\n$$L(\\alpha) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{\\|\\alpha_1'(u)\\|^2 + |\\alpha_2'(u)|^2} \\, du \\ge \\sqrt{\\left(\\int_a^b \\|\\alpha_1'(u)\\| \\, du\\right)^2 + \\left(\\int_a^b |\\alpha_2'(u)| \\, du\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{L(\\alpha_1)^2 + L(\\alpha_2)^2}$$\nTaking the infimum over all curves $\\alpha$ connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$, we obtain a lower bound for the distance $d(p_1, p_2)$:\n$$d(p_1, p_2) = \\inf_{\\alpha} L(\\alpha) \\ge \\sqrt{(\\inf_{\\alpha_1} L(\\alpha_1))^2 + (\\inf_{\\alpha_2} L(\\alpha_2))^2} = \\sqrt{d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)^2 + d_{\\mathbb{R}}(t_1, t_2)^2}$$\nwhere $d_{S^1}$ and $d_{\\mathbb{R}}$ are the intrinsic distance functions on $S^1$ and $\\mathbb{R}$, respectively. The distance on $\\mathbb{R}$ is $d_{\\mathbb{R}}(t_1, t_2) = |t_1 - t_2|$.\n\nThis lower bound is achieved by a geodesic. In a product space, a curve $\\alpha(s) = (\\alpha_1(s), \\alpha_2(s))$ is a geodesic if and only if its components $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are geodesics (possibly after reparameterization). Let $\\gamma_1$ be a minimal geodesic in $S^1$ from $\\theta_1$ to $\\theta_2$ and $\\gamma_2$ be the unique minimal geodesic (a straight line segment) in $\\mathbb{R}$ from $t_1$ to $t_2$. Their lengths are $L_1 = d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$ and $L_2 = |t_1 - t_2|$, respectively. A geodesic in $M$ connecting $p_1$ and $p_2$ can be constructed with length $\\sqrt{L_1^2 + L_2^2}$. Thus, the distance is precisely this value:\n$$d(p_1, p_2)^2 = d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)^2 + (t_1 - t_2)^2$$\nFor the problem at hand, we need the distance between a point $p = (\\theta, t)$ and a point on the ray $\\gamma(s) = (\\theta_0, s)$. Applying the derived formula:\n$$d(p, \\gamma(s)) = d\\big((\\theta,t),(\\theta_{0},s)\\big) = \\sqrt{d_{S^{1}}(\\theta, \\theta_{0})^2 + (t-s)^2}$$\n\n**Step 2: Computation of the Busemann function**\n\nThe forward Busemann function $b^{+}(p)$ is defined by the limit:\n$$b^{+}(p) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\big( d(p, \\gamma(s)) - s \\big)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the distance and the coordinates of $p=(\\theta,t)$:\n$$b^{+}(\\theta, t) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\left( \\sqrt{d_{S^{1}}(\\theta, \\theta_{0})^2 + (t-s)^2} - s \\right)$$\nFor large $s$, we have $s > t$, so $(t-s)^2 = (s-t)^2$. Let $D = d_{S^{1}}(\\theta, \\theta_{0})$ be the constant distance on the circle. The limit is of the indeterminate form $\\infty - \\infty$. We multiply and divide by the conjugate expression:\n$$b^{+}(\\theta, t) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{D^2 + (s-t)^2} - s\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{D^2 + (s-t)^2} + s\\right)}{\\sqrt{D^2 + (s-t)^2} + s}$$\n$$= \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{D^2 + (s-t)^2 - s^2}{\\sqrt{D^2 + s^2 - 2st + t^2} + s}$$\n$$= \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{D^2 + s^2 - 2st + t^2 - s^2}{\\sqrt{s^2\\left(\\frac{D^2+t^2}{s^2} - \\frac{2t}{s} + 1\\right)} + s}$$\n$$= \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{D^2 + t^2 - 2st}{s\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2t}{s} + \\frac{D^2+t^2}{s^2}} + s}$$\nWe divide the numerator and the denominator by $s$:\n$$= \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{D^2+t^2}{s} - 2t}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2t}{s} + \\frac{D^2+t^2}{s^2}} + 1}$$\nTaking the limit as $s \\to \\infty$, the terms with $s$ in the denominator go to $0$:\n$$= \\frac{0 - 2t}{\\sqrt{1 - 0 + 0} + 1} = \\frac{-2t}{1+1} = -t$$\nThus, the Busemann function is $b^{+}(\\theta, t) = -t$.\n\n**Step 3: Verification that $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u) = (\\theta_{0}, u)$ is a line**\n\nA line is a complete geodesic that minimizes the distance between any two of its points.\n1.  **Geodesic property**: The curve $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u)$ has component curves $\\alpha_1(u) = \\theta_0$ and $\\alpha_2(u) = u$. The first component, a constant point, is a trivial geodesic in $S^1$. The second component is a straight line with constant speed parameterization, which is a geodesic in $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u)$ is a geodesic in the product manifold $M$.\n2.  **Completeness**: The curve is defined for all $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$, so it is a complete geodesic.\n3.  **Minimizing property**: Let $p_1 = \\tilde{\\gamma}(u_1) = (\\theta_0, u_1)$ and $p_2 = \\tilde{\\gamma}(u_2) = (\\theta_0, u_2)$ be two points on the curve. The Riemannian distance between them is:\n    $$d(p_1, p_2) = \\sqrt{d_{S^1}(\\theta_0, \\theta_0)^2 + (u_1-u_2)^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + (u_1-u_2)^2} = |u_1 - u_2|$$\n    The arc length of the segment of $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ between $u_1$ and $u_2$ is found by integrating its speed. The tangent vector is $\\tilde{\\gamma}'(u) = (0,1)$, so its speed is $\\|\\tilde{\\gamma}'(u)\\|_g = \\sqrt{\\|0\\|_{g_{S^1}}^2 + |1|^2} = 1$. The arc length is $\\int_{u_1}^{u_2} 1 \\, du = u_2 - u_1 = |u_2 - u_1|$ (for $u_2 \\ge u_1$).\n    Since the arc length along the geodesic segment equals the Riemannian distance between its endpoints, $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is a minimizing geodesic.\nThus, $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u)$ is a line.\n\n**Step 4: Gradient of $b^{+}$ and the Splitting Theorem**\n\nWe found that $b^{+}(\\theta, t) = -t$. Let the local coordinate for $S^1$ be $\\phi$. Then $b^{+}(\\phi,t)=-t$. The metric in these coordinates is $g = d\\phi^2 + dt^2$, so the metric tensor is $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$. The gradient $\\nabla b^{+}$ is the vector field dual to the $1$-form $db^{+}$. In coordinates, $(\\nabla b^{+})^i = g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial b^{+}}{\\partial x^j}$.\n$$db^{+} = \\frac{\\partial(-t)}{\\partial \\phi}d\\phi + \\frac{\\partial(-t)}{\\partial t}dt = 0 \\cdot d\\phi - 1 \\cdot dt = -dt$$\nThe dual vector field is $\\nabla b^{+} = g^{\\phi j}\\partial_j b^{+} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} + g^{t j}\\partial_j b^{+} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = g^{tt} (-1) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 1 \\cdot (-1) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.\nThe norm of the gradient is $\\|\\nabla b^{+}\\| = \\sqrt{g(-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t})} = \\sqrt{g_{tt}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$. It is a unit vector field.\n\nA vector field $V$ is parallel if its covariant derivative $\\nabla V$ is zero. In the coordinates $(\\phi, t)$, the metric components $g_{ij}$ are constant, which implies all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero. The components of $\\nabla b^{+} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ are constant ($V^\\phi=0, V^t=-1$). The covariant derivative of $V$ is given by $(\\nabla_k V^i) \\partial_i = (\\partial_k V^i + \\Gamma^i_{kj}V^j)\\partial_i$. Since $\\partial_k V^i=0$ and $\\Gamma^i_{kj}=0$, the covariant derivative is zero. Hence, $\\nabla b^{+}$ is a parallel unit vector field.\n\nThe Cheeger–Gromoll splitting theorem states that any complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with non-negative Ricci curvature ($\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$) that contains a line must split isometrically as a product $M \\cong N \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n- Our manifold $M=S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ is complete.\n- We have demonstrated it contains a line $\\tilde{\\gamma}(u) = (\\theta_0, u)$.\n- The Ricci curvature of a product is the direct sum of the Ricci curvatures of its factors. The standard metric on $S^1$ is flat ($\\mathrm{Ric}_{S^1}=0$), and the standard metric on $\\mathbb{R}$ is flat ($\\mathrm{Ric}_{\\mathbb{R}}=0$). Thus, $\\mathrm{Ric}_M \\equiv 0$, which satisfies the condition $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$.\n\nAll conditions of the theorem are met. The existence of a line gives rise to the function $b^{+}$, whose gradient is a parallel unit vector field. This field, $\\nabla b^{+} = -\\partial/\\partial t$, generates the $\\mathbb{R}$ factor in the splitting. The integral curves of $\\nabla b^{+}$ are the vertical lines $(\\text{const}, t)$, and the orthogonal hypersurfaces are the level sets of $b^{+}$, i.e., $t=\\text{const}$, which are copies of $S^1$.

Let $p = (x,z)$, where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ and $z > 0$. The point on the geodesic is $\\gamma(t) = (0, \\exp(t))$. The Riemannian distance $d_g$ in the upper half-space model between points $p_1=(x_1, z_1)$ and $p_2=(x_2, z_2)$ is given by the formula:\n$$d_g(p_1, p_2) = \\arccosh\\left(1 + \\frac{\\|x_1 - x_2\\|^2 + (z_1 - z_2)^2}{2 z_1 z_2}\\right)$$\nFor $p=(x,z)$ and $\\gamma(t)=(0, \\exp(t))$, the distance is:\n$$d_g(p, \\gamma(t)) = \\arccosh\\left(1 + \\frac{\\|x\\|^2 + (z - \\exp(t))^2}{2 z \\exp(t)}\\right)$$\nWe simplify the argument of the $\\arccosh$ function:\n$$1 + \\frac{\\|x\\|^2 + z^2 - 2z\\exp(t) + \\exp(2t)}{2 z \\exp(t)} = \\frac{2z\\exp(t) + \\|x\\|^2 + z^2 - 2z\\exp(t) + \\exp(2t)}{2 z \\exp(t)} = \\frac{\\|x\\|^2 + z^2 + \\exp(2t)}{2 z \\exp(t)}$$\nSo we need to compute the limit:\n$$b_{\\gamma}(x,z) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\arccosh\\left(\\frac{\\|x\\|^2 + z^2 + \\exp(2t)}{2 z \\exp(t)}\\right) - t \\right]$$\nTo evaluate this limit of the form $\\infty - \\infty$, we use the identity $\\arccosh(u) = \\ln(u + \\sqrt{u^2-1})$.

It only depends on the $z$ coordinate, which is expected as the geodesic $\\gamma$ is vertical and the horospheres are horizontal planes.\n\n**2. Proof that $b_{\\gamma}$ is $1$-Lipschitz**\n\nA function $f$ on a Riemannian manifold is $1$-Lipschitz if its gradient has unit norm, i.e., $|\\nabla f|_g = 1$. Let's compute the norm of the gradient of $b_{\\gamma}(x,z) = -\\ln(z)$. The gradient covector is $\\nabla b_{\\gamma} = d(-\\ln z) = (0, \\dots, 0, -1/z)$. The metric tensor is $g_{ij} = z^{-2}\\delta_{ij}$ and its inverse is $g^{ij} = z^2\\delta_{ij}$. The squared norm of the gradient is:\n$$|\\nabla b_{\\gamma}|_g^2 = \\sum_{i,j=1}^n g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x^i} \\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x^j}$$\nSince $b_\\gamma$ depends only on $z$ (let's denote it $x^n$), the only non-zero partial derivative is $\\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{z}$.\n$$|\\nabla b_{\\gamma}|_g^2 = g^{zz} \\left(\\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial z}\\right)^2 = z^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{z}\\right)^2 = z^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{z^2}\\right) = 1$$\nSince $|\\nabla b_{\\gamma}|_g = 1$ everywhere, the function $b_{\\gamma}$ is $1$-Lipschitz. For any two points $p, q$ connected by a unit-speed geodesic $c(s)$ of length $L=d_g(p,q)$, we have:\n$$|b_{\\gamma}(q) - b_{\\gamma}(p)| = \\left|\\int_0^L \\frac{d}{ds}b_{\\gamma}(c(s)) ds\\right| = \\left|\\int_0^L \\langle \\nabla b_{\\gamma}(c(s)), c'(s) \\rangle_g ds\\right|$$\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, $|\\langle \\nabla b_{\\gamma}, c' \\rangle_g| \\le |\\nabla b_{\\gamma}|_g |c'|_g = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n$$|b_{\\gamma}(q) - b_{\\gamma}(p)| \\le \\int_0^L 1 ds = L = d_g(p,q)$$\nThis confirms that $b_{\\gamma}$ is $1$-Lipschitz.\n\n**3. Computation and Interpretation of the Laplacian $\\Delta b_{\\gamma}$**\n\nThe Laplacian of a function $f$ in local coordinates is given by $\\Delta f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det g}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\left(\\sqrt{\\det g} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^j}\\right)$.\nFor the metric $g_{ij} = z^{-2}\\delta_{ij}$ in $n$ dimensions, $\\det g = (z^{-2})^n = z^{-2n}$, so $\\sqrt{\\det g} = z^{-n}$.\nOur function is $b_{\\gamma}(z) = -\\ln(z)$. The gradient vector field components are $V^i = g^{ij}\\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial x^j}$. The only non-zero component is for the $z$ coordinate (denoted by index $n$):\n$$V^n = g^{nn} \\frac{\\partial b_{\\gamma}}{\\partial z} = z^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{z}\\right) = -z$$\nAll other components $V^i=0$ for $i < n$. The Laplacian calculation simplifies to a single term:\n$$\\Delta b_{\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det g}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(\\sqrt{\\det g} V^n\\right) = z^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(z^{-n}(-z)\\right) = z^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(-z^{-n+1}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta b_{\\gamma} = z^n \\left(-(-n+1)z^{-n+1-1}\\right) = z^n \\left((n-1)z^{-n}\\right) = n-1$$\nThe Laplacian of the Busemann function is the constant value $\\Delta b_{\\gamma} = n-1$.\n\n**Interpretation and Connection to the Splitting Theorem:**\n\nThe Cheeger-Gromoll Splitting Theorem is a foundational result for manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature ($\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$). It states that a complete manifold with $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$ that contains a line (a doubly-infinite distance-minimizing geodesic) must isometrically split as a product $M \\cong N \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nA key step in the proof involves showing that the Busemann functions associated with the line are harmonic, i.e., their Laplacian is zero. This follows from the Bochner formula:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta(|\\nabla f|^2) = |\\nabla^2 f|^2 + \\mathrm{Ric}(\\nabla f, \\nabla f) + \\langle \\nabla f, \\nabla(\\Delta f) \\rangle$$\nFor a Busemann function $b$, $|\\nabla b|_g^2=1$, so the left side is $0$. If we assume $\\mathrm{Ric} \\ge 0$, the Bochner formula becomes $0 = |\\nabla^2 b|^2 + \\mathrm{Ric}(\\nabla b, \\nabla b) + \\langle \\nabla b, \\nabla(\\Delta b) \\rangle$. A deeper analysis shows this forces $\\Delta b = 0$.\n\nIn our case, $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is a space of constant sectional curvature $K=-1$, and its Ricci curvature is strictly negative: $\\mathrm{Ric} = -(n-1)g$. The Busemann function $b_{\\gamma} = -\\ln(z)$ is not harmonic; its Laplacian is $\\Delta b_{\\gamma} = n-1$. This value is positive for $n \\ge 2$, meaning $b_\\gamma$ is strictly subharmonic.\n\nThis result perfectly illustrates why the Splitting Theorem does not apply to manifolds with negative curvature. Let's verify the Bochner formula for our function $b_\\gamma$.\n- $|\\nabla b_\\gamma|_g^2 = 1$, so $\\Delta(|\\nabla b_\\gamma|_g^2) = 0$.\n- $\\Delta b_\\gamma = n-1$, which is constant, so $\\nabla(\\Delta b_\\gamma) = 0$.\n- $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\nabla b_\\gamma, \\nabla b_\\gamma) = -(n-1)g(\\nabla b_\\gamma, \\nabla b_\\gamma) = -(n-1)|\\nabla b_\\gamma|_g^2 = -(n-1)$.\n- It can be shown that $|\\nabla^2 b_\\gamma|^2 = n-1$.\nThe Bochner formula becomes $0 = (n-1) + (-(n-1)) + 0$, which is consistent.\n\nThe non-zero, positive Laplacian $\\Delta b_\\gamma = n-1$ is a direct consequence of the negative Ricci curvature. The term $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\nabla b_\\gamma, \\nabla b_\\gamma) = -(n-1)$ is negative, which forces the Hessian term $|\\nabla^2 b_\\gamma|^2$ to be positive. A non-zero Hessian means the gradient field $\\nabla b_\\gamma$ is not parallel, and the function $b_\\gamma$ is not harmonic. Geometrically, $\\Delta b_\\gamma$ represents the mean curvature of the level sets of $b_\\gamma$ (the horospheres). The value $n-1$ shows that these horospheres are not minimal surfaces, as they would be in the case of non-negative Ricci curvature. Thus, the harmonicity feature required for the splitting argument is absent in hyperbolic space, and this is fundamentally due to its negative curvature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n-1}$$", "id": "3004376"}]}
