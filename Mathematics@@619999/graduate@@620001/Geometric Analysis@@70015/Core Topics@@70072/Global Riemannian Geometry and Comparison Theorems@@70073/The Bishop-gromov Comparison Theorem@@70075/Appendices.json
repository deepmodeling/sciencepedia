The scale factor for the metric on geodesic spheres is governed by the function $S_k(r)$, which is the unique solution to the Jacobi equation $y'' + ky = 0$ with initial conditions appropriate for parametrizing distances from a point.\n\nFirst, we solve for $S_k(r)$ for each value of $k \\in \\{0, +1, -1\\}$. The differential equation is $S_k''(r) + k S_k(r) = 0$, with initial conditions $S_k(0) = 0$ and $S_k'(0) = 1$.\n\nCase $k=0$ (Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$):\nThe equation is $S_0''(r) = 0$. The general solution is $S_0(r) = Ar + B$.\nApplying the initial conditions:\n$S_0(0) = B = 0$.\n$S_0'(r) = A$, so $S_0'(0) = A = 1$.\nThus, for $k=0$, we have $S_0(r) = r$.\n\nCase $k=+1$ (Sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n$):\nThe equation is $S_{+1}''(r) + S_{+1}(r) = 0$.
