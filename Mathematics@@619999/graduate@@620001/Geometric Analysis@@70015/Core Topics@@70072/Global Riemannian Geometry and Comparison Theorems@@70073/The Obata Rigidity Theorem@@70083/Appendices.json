We will determine how the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian, $\\lambda_{1}$, and the Ricci curvature lower bound parameter, $k$, transform under this scaling.\n\n**1. Scaling of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator and its First Eigenvalue**\n\nLet $(x^{i})$ be a local coordinate system. The components of the metric $g$ are denoted by $g_{ij}$, and the components of its inverse are $g^{ij}$. For the rescaled metric $g_{r}$, the components are $(g_{r})_{ij} = r^{2} g_{ij}$, and the components of its inverse are $(g_{r})^{ij} = (r^{2} g_{ij})^{-1} = r^{-2} g^{ij}$. The determinant of the metric matrix scales as $\\det(g_{r}) = \\det(r^{2} [g_{ij}]) = (r^{2})^{n} \\det(g) = r^{2n} \\det(g)$. Consequently, the square root of the determinant scales as $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{r})} = r^{n} \\sqrt{\\det(g)}$.\n\nThe Laplace-Beltrami operator, $\\Delta_{g}$, acting on a smooth function $f$ is given in local coordinates by the formula:\n$$\n\\Delta_{g} f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right)\n$$\nWe compute the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_{g_{r}}$ for the rescaled metric $g_{r}$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{g_{r}} f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g_{r})}} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g_{r})} (g_{r})^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the scaling relations for the metric components and its determinant:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta_{g_{r}} f &= \\frac{1}{r^{n} \\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( \\left(r^{n} \\sqrt{\\det(g)}\\right) \\left(r^{-2} g^{ij}\\right) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{r^{n} \\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( r^{n-2} \\sqrt{\\det(g)} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSince $r$ is a constant, the term $r^{n-2}$ can be factored out of the partial derivative:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta_{g_{r}} f &= \\frac{r^{n-2}}{r^{n}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right) \\right) \\\\\n&= r^{-2} \\Delta_{g} f\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThus, the operator itself scales as $\\Delta_{g_{r}} = r^{-2} \\Delta_{g}$.\n\nNow, let $f$ be an eigenfunction corresponding to the first nonzero eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}(g)$, satisfying the equation $\\Delta_{g} f + \\lambda_{1}(g) f = 0$.

Since the Christoffel symbols are invariant under the scaling, the Riemann tensor $R^{l}_{ijk}$ is also invariant:\n$$\n(R_{g_{r}})^{l}_{ijk} = (R_{g})^{l}_{ijk}\n$$\nThe Ricci tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$, is the contraction of the Riemann tensor, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = R^{k}_{ikj}$.

We want to find the parameter $k_{r}$ such that the analogous condition holds for the rescaled metric: $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}} \\geq (n-1) k_{r} g_{r}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{r}}$ and $g_{r}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{g} \\geq (n-1) k_{r} (r^{2} g)\n$$\nThis inequality can be written as $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g} \\geq (n-1) (k_{r} r^{2}) g$.\nWe are given that $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g} \\geq (n-1) k g$. Comparing the two inequalities, the new condition is satisfied if the original condition holds.

The computation is to be performed by analyzing the function $f(x) = x_{n+1}$ and the Hessian equation it satisfies.\n\nFirst, let us establish the relationship between the geometric quantities associated with the metrics $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and $g_{c}$. Let $\\nabla$ and $\\nabla^{c}$ be the Levi-Civita connections corresponding to $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and $g_{c}$, respectively. For any vector fields $X, Y, Z$ on $S^{n}$, Koszul's formula for $\\nabla^{c}$ is:\n$$2g_{c}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = X(g_{c}(Y,Z)) + Y(g_{c}(X,Z)) - Z(g_{c}(X,Y)) + g_{c}([X,Y],Z) - g_{c}([X,Z],Y) - g_{c}([Y,Z],X)$$\nSubstituting $g_{c} = c^{2} g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ and noting that $c$ is a constant, we have:\n$$2c^{2}g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = c^{2} \\left[ X(g_{\\mathrm{can}}(Y,Z)) + \\dots \\right] = c^{2} \\left[ 2g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z) \\right]$$\nThis implies $g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y, Z) = g_{\\mathrm{can}}(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z)$. Since this holds for any vector field $Z$, we conclude that the Levi-Civita connection is invariant under constant scaling of the metric:\n$$\\nabla^{c}_{X}Y = \\nabla_{X}Y$$\n\nNext, we compute the Hessian of the function $f(x) = x_{n+1}$ on $(S^{n}, g_{\\mathrm{can}})$. Let $\\tilde{f}: \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the linear function $\\tilde{f}(x) = x_{n+1}$ whose restriction to $S^{n}$ is $f$. Let $D$ denote the flat connection on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.

At a point $p \\in S^{n}$, the outward unit normal vector is $N(p) = p$. The tangential projection of a vector $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is $V^{\\top} = V - g_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}(V, N)N$.

Using the product rule for $D_{X}(fN)$:\n$$D_{X}(fN) = (Xf)N + f(D_{X}N)$$\nFor the unit sphere with outward normal $N(p)=p$, the ambient derivative of the normal field in a tangential direction $X$ is $D_X N = X$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D_X(fN)$:\n$$D_{X}(fN) = (Xf)N + fX$$\nTherefore, $D_{X}G = -((Xf)N + fX)$.

It is a standard result that if a nonconstant function $f$ satisfies $\\nabla^2 f = -c f g$ for a constant $c$, the manifold must have constant sectional curvature $c$. From this, the Ricci tensor is derived. The Riemann curvature tensor for constant sectional curvature $c$ is given in local coordinates by $R_{ijkl} = c(g_{jk}g_{il} - g_{ik}g_{jl})$. The Ricci tensor is the trace $g^{ik}R_{ijkl}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}_{jl} = g^{ik}R_{ijkl} = g^{ik} c(g_{ik}g_{jl} - g_{il}g_{jk}) = c( (g^{ik}g_{ik})g_{jl} - g^{ik}g_{il}g_{jk}) = c(n g_{jl} - \\delta^k_l g_{jk}) = c(n g_{jl} - g_{jl}) = (n-1)c g_{jl}\n$$\nThus, the equation implies that $(M,g)$ is an Einstein manifold with Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)c g$.

If $(M,g)$ is complete, Myers’ theorem yields a finite diameter, hence compactness, which excludes noncompact space forms.\n\nThis statement is correct. As derived above, the equation implies $\\operatorname{Ric} = (n-1)c g$. Since $c > 0$, the Ricci curvature satisfies the condition $\\operatorname{Ric}(V,V) \\ge (n-1)c g(V,V)$ for any tangent vector $V$.

In our case, $K=c$. Thus, if $(M,g)$ is assumed to be complete, Myers' theorem forces it to be compact. This rules out any possibility of the manifold being noncompact, which is a crucial step in the rigidity proof that ultimately identifies $M$ with the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n(1/\\sqrt{c})$.

The mere existence of a nonconstant solution of $\\nabla^2 f = - c f g$ for $c>0$ forces $(M,g)$ to be compact; completeness is not needed.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The equation $\\nabla^2 f = -c f g$ is a local differential equation. It being satisfied on a manifold does not impose global topological properties like compactness without further assumptions. A simple counterexample is to take the standard sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n$ of radius $1/\\sqrt{c}$, which is compact and admits a \"height function\" $f$ satisfying the equation. If we remove one or more points from this sphere, say $M = \\mathbb{S}^n \\setminus \\{p\\}$, the resulting manifold is non-compact. The restriction of the function $f$ to $M$ will still satisfy the equation $\\nabla^2 f = -c f g$ as a local identity.

If completeness is not assumed, there are noncompact counterexamples: proper open subsets of the round sphere of radius $1/\\sqrt{c}$ with the induced metric admit restrictions of height functions $f$ satisfying $\\nabla^2 f = - c f g$, but these open subsets are geodesically incomplete. Completeness is therefore needed to rule them out.\n\nThis statement correctly identifies the flaw in the argument if completeness is omitted. As explained in the analysis of option B, any proper open subset of the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^n(1/\\sqrt{c})$ provides a counterexample to the rigidity theorem. For instance, $M = \\mathbb{S}^n(1/\\sqrt{c}) \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is non-compact and not isometric to the full sphere. However, it inherits the metric and a function $f$ satisfying the local equation. Such a manifold is geodesically incomplete because a geodesic on the full sphere that passes through the deleted point $p$ cannot be extended for all time within $M$. The hypothesis of completeness is precisely what excludes these \"trivial\" counterexamples, forcing any candidate manifold to be globally well-behaved in a way that allows for the application of powerful global theorems like Myers' theorem. This statement provides an excellent justification for the necessity of the completeness hypothesis.\n\n**Verdict on C: Correct**\n\nD. Noncompact space forms of positive curvature $c>0$ exist and are complete, so compactness cannot exclude them; instead, simply connectedness is necessary.\n\nThis statement contains a fundamental factual error. A \"space form\" is, by definition, a complete, connected Riemannian manifold of constant sectional curvature. As established in the analysis of option A, the Bonnet-Myers theorem implies that any complete, connected Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded below by a positive constant (which is true for constant positive curvature $c$) must be compact. Therefore, there are **no** noncompact, complete space forms of positive curvature. The premise of this option is false, rendering the entire statement invalid. While simple connectedness is also a key hypothesis in some versions of rigidity theorems (to distinguish the sphere from its quotients like real projective space), the reasoning presented here is unsound.\n\n**Verdict on D: Incorrect**\n\nE. In the absence of compactness, the identity $\\Delta f = - n c f$ forces the fundamental tone of the Laplacian to be $n c$, which alone implies spherical rigidity; completeness plays no role.\n\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, on a non-compact manifold, the spectrum of the Laplacian can be continuous, and the concept of \"fundamental tone\" (first non-zero eigenvalue) is more subtle than in the compact case. The existence of one eigenfunction with eigenvalue $nc$ does not automatically mean this is the bottom of the spectrum. Second, and more critically, the eigenvalue equation $\\Delta f = - n c f$ is not sufficient for spherical rigidity without compactness. The very counterexamples cited in option C (open subsets of the sphere) have functions satisfying this eigenvalue equation, yet they are not isometric to the sphere. This demonstrates that compactness (or completeness, which implies compactness in this context) is an essential hypothesis. The claim that \"completeness plays no role\" is demonstrably false.\n\n**Verdict on E: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, statements A and C both provide correct and complementary justifications for why completeness is a necessary hypothesis for the Obata rigidity theorem.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "3036331"}]}
