The derivation must proceed from a set of specified foundational inputs.\n\nLet the ambient space be $(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}, g_E)$, where $g_E$ is the standard Euclidean metric. The covariant derivative in this flat space, denoted by $D$, is the usual directional derivative of the components of vector fields. The Riemann curvature tensor of the ambient space, $\\bar{R}$, is identically zero since the space is flat.\n\nThe sphere $S^n$ is the hypersurface defined by $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : g_E(x,x) = |x|^2 = r^2\\}$. For any point $p \\in S^n$, the tangent space $T_p S^n$ consists of vectors $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $g_E(X, p) = 0$. The metric $g$ on $S^n$ is the metric induced by the embedding, i.e., for any two tangent vectors $X, Y \\in T_p S^n$, $g(X,Y) = g_E(X,Y)$.\n\nLet $X$ and $Y$ be vector fields tangent to $S^n$. The derivative $D_X Y$ in the ambient space can be decomposed into its component tangential to $S^n$ and its component normal to $S^n$. This is the Gauss formula:\n$$D_X Y = \\nabla_X Y + h(X, Y)$$\nwhere $\\nabla_X Y$ is the tangential component, defining the Levi-Civita connection on $(S^n, g)$, and $h(X, Y)$ is the normal component, which is the second fundamental form.\n\nThe second fundamental form is a vector-valued bilinear form. For a hypersurface, it can be expressed in terms of a scalar-valued bilinear form and the unit normal vector field $\\nu$. The problem provides the unit normal field as $\\nu(x) = x/r$. The second fundamental form is then $h(X, Y) = g(A(X), Y)\\nu$, where $A$ is the shape operator (or Weingarten map).\n\nThe problem provides the Weingarten relation: $A(X) = -D_X \\nu$. We compute $D_X \\nu$ for a tangent vector field $X$. At a point $p \\in S^n$, we have:\n$$A_p(X_p) = -D_{X_p} \\nu$$\nThe vector field $\\nu(x)$ is defined on the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ as $\\nu(x) = \\frac{1}{r}x$. The covariant derivative $D_{X_p} \\nu$ is the directional derivative of $\\nu$ at $p$ in the direction $X_p$:\n$$D_{X_p} \\nu = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{\\nu(p + tX_p) - \\nu(p)}{t} = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{\\frac{1}{r}(p + tX_p) - \\frac{1}{r}p}{t} = \\frac{1}{r} \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{p + tX_p - p}{t} = \\frac{1}{r}X_p$$\nThus, the shape operator is given by:\n$$A(X) = -D_X \\nu = -\\frac{1}{r}X$$\nThis means that $A$ is a scalar multiple of the identity map on each tangent space, $A = -\\frac{1}{r}I$.\n\nThe relationship between the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ of the submanifold $(S^n, g)$, the curvature tensor $\\bar{R}$ of the ambient space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}, g_E)$, and the shape operator $A$ is given by the Gauss equation. For orthonormal vectors $X, Y, Z, W \\in T_pS^n$:\n$$g(R(X,Y)Z,W) = g_E(\\bar{R}(X,Y)Z,W) + g(A(X),W)g(A(Y),Z) - g(A(X),Z)g(A(Y),W)$$\nSince the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is flat, $\\bar{R} \\equiv 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$g(R(X,Y)Z,W) = g(A(X),W)g(A(Y),Z) - g(A(X),Z)g(A(Y),W)$$\nWe substitute our expression for the shape operator, $A(V) = -\\frac{1}{r}V$:\n$$g(R(X,Y)Z,W) = g(-\\frac{1}{r}X,W)g(-\\frac{1}{r}Y,Z) - g(-\\frac{1}{r}X,Z)g(-\\frac{1}{r}Y,W)$$\n$$g(R(X,Y)Z,W) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ g(X,W)g(Y,Z) - g(X,Z)g(Y,W) \\right]$$\nThis expression fully determines the Riemann curvature tensor of the sphere.\n\nNow we compute the sectional curvature $K(\\sigma)$ for an arbitrary $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p S^n$. The sectional curvature is defined as $K(\\sigma) = g(R(X,Y)Y,X)$ where $\\{X,Y\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the plane $\\sigma$. Orthonormality means $g(X,X)=1$, $g(Y,Y)=1$, and $g(X,Y)=0$.\n\nSetting $Z=Y$ and $W=X$ in our expression for the Riemann tensor:\n$$K(\\sigma) = g(R(X,Y)Y,X) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ g(X,X)g(Y,Y) - g(X,Y)g(Y,X) \\right]$$\nSubstituting the orthonormality conditions:\n$$K(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\left[ (1)(1) - (0)(0) \\right]$$\n$$K(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{r^2}$$\nThe result $K(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{r^2}$ is independent of the point $p \\in S^n$ and the choice of the $2$-plane $\\sigma \\subset T_p S^n$. Therefore, the sectional curvature of the sphere $(S^n, r^2 g_{\\mathrm{can}})$ is constant. Furthermore, since the radius $r$ is given as $r>0$, it follows that $r^2>0$, and the sectional curvature $K = \\frac{1}{r^2}$ is strictly positive. This completes the verification. The final expression for the sectional curvature depends only on $r$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{r^2}}$$", "id": "3033912"}, {"introduction": "The genius of Synge's argument lies in converting a geometric property, positive curvature, into a powerful analytic statement about the instability of geodesics.

We are asked to compute the index form $I(V,V)$ for a specific vector field $V$ along a closed geodesic $\\gamma$ on the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$ and to interpret the result in the context of Synge's theorem.\n\nThe index form is given by the formula:\n$$\nI(V,V) = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\Big( \\langle D_{t} V, D_{t} V \\rangle - \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle \\Big) \\, dt\n$$\nWe are given several conditions on the vector field $V$ and the geodesic $\\gamma$.\n1. $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, which implies $|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)| = 1$ for all $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n2. $V$ is a parallel vector field along $\\gamma$, meaning its covariant derivative along $\\gamma$ is zero: $D_{t} V = 0$.\n3. $V$ has unit length: $|V(t)| = 1$ for all $t$.\n4. $V$ is orthogonal to the geodesic's velocity vector: $\\langle V(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t$.\n\nLet us first simplify the integrand using the given information.

Since we are given that $D_{t} V = 0$, this term is identically zero:\n$$\n\\langle D_{t} V, D_{t} V \\rangle = \\langle 0, 0 \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThus, the index form simplifies to:\n$$\nI(V,V) = - \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle \\, dt\n$$\nNow, we must evaluate the term involving the Riemann curvature tensor $R$. The manifold is the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$ with its standard round metric, which is a space of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. For a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor is given by the formula:\n$$\nR(X,Y)Z = K \\left( \\langle Y, Z \\rangle X - \\langle X, Z \\rangle Y \\right)\n$$\nIn our case, $K=1$, and we substitute $X=V$, $Y=\\dot{\\gamma}$, and $Z=\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$\nR(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma} = 1 \\cdot \\left( \\langle \\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle V - \\langle V, \\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nWe can now use the properties of $\\gamma$ and $V$. Since $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = |\\dot{\\gamma}(t)|^2 = 1^2 = 1$. Since $V$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$, we have $\\langle V(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle = 0$. Substituting these into the expression for the curvature tensor gives:\n$$\nR(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma} = (1)V - (0)\\dot{\\gamma} = V\n$$\nNow we substitute this result back into the integrand for the index form:\n$$\n\\langle R(V, \\dot{\\gamma}) \\dot{\\gamma}, V \\rangle = \\langle V, V \\rangle\n$$\nSince $V$ is a unit vector field, we have $\\langle V(t), V(t) \\rangle = |V(t)|^2 = 1^2 = 1$.

Synge's theorem states that a compact, orientable, even-dimensional Riemannian manifold with strictly positive sectional curvature must be simply connected. A related result is that a compact, odd-dimensional manifold with positive sectional curvature must be orientable.\n\nThe core of the proof relies on the second variation of the energy functional, which is given by the index form. A geodesic is a critical point of the energy functional. If the second variation (the index form) can be made negative for some variation field, the geodesic is not a local minimum of energy (and therefore not a minimum of length). Such a geodesic is called unstable.\n\nOur calculation, $I(V,V) = -2\\pi < 0$, explicitly demonstrates that the great circle geodesic $\\gamma$ is unstable. The existence of even one such vector field $V$ for which the index form is negative implies that the index of the geodesic is at least $1$.\n\nThe argument for Synge's theorem for simple connectivity proceeds by contradiction. Assume $M$ is a compact, orientable, even-dimensional manifold with positive sectional curvature, but is *not* simply connected. Then there exists a non-trivial homotopy class of loops. In this class, there must be a loop of minimum length, which is a closed geodesic $\\gamma$. Because $M$ is orientable, one can construct a non-trivial periodic parallel vector field $V$ along $\\gamma$ that is everywhere orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$ (as in this problem). The second variation formula for such a field in a positively curved space yields a negative value, as we have explicitly calculated for $S^n$. This implies that $\\gamma$ is not a true local minimum of length, contradicting the assumption that it was the shortest loop in its homotopy class. Therefore, no such non-trivial loop can exist, and the manifold must be simply connected ($\\pi_1(M) = \\{e\\}$).\n\nOur specific result $I(V,V) = -2\\pi$ provides a concrete calculation underpinning this fundamental argument in Riemannian geometry, showing how positive curvature forces global topological properties.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2\\pi}\n$$", "id": "2992056"}, {"introduction": "The power of a theorem is defined as much by its conclusions as by the precision of its hypotheses.

This action is free and properly discontinuous. The quotient space $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is a smooth $n$-dimensional manifold. Since $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is the image of the compact set $[0,1]^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ under the quotient map $p \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{T}^n$, the manifold $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is compact. The metric $g_0$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is defined such that the projection $p$ is a local isometry from $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\text{eucl}})$ to $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_0)$.\n\n2.  **Curvature:** Sectional curvature is a local geometric invariant. Since $p$ is a local isometry, the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_0)$ at any point must be equal to the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\text{eucl}})$ at the corresponding points. The standard Euclidean metric $g_{\\text{eucl}}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is flat; its Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero. Consequently, its sectional curvature is identically zero, $K_{\\text{eucl}} \\equiv 0$. Therefore, the sectional curvature of $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g_0)$ is also identically zero, $K \\equiv 0$. This means the sectional curvature is non-negative ($K \\ge 0$) but not strictly positive ($K > 0$).\n\n3.  **Fundamental Group:** The space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the universal covering space of $\\mathbb{T}^n$, as $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is simply connected. The fundamental group of the base space, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{T}^n)$, is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations of the covering. The deck transformations are precisely the integer translations by vectors in $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. Thus, the fundamental group of the $n$-torus is $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{T}^n) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^n$. For any $n \\ge 1$, this group is non-trivial. In particular, $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is not simply connected.\n\n4.  **Orientability:** An orientation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by a choice of a continuous, non-vanishing $n$-form, e.g., $dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n$. A diffeomorphism $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is orientation-preserving if the determinant of its Jacobian matrix is positive. The deck transformations are translations $T_v(x) = x+v$ for $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The Jacobian of $T_v$ is the identity matrix, whose determinant is $1$. Therefore, the action of $\\mathbb{Z}^n$ is by orientation-preserving isometries. Because the group of deck transformations preserves orientation, the orientation of the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ projects to a well-defined orientation on the quotient manifold $\\mathbb{T}^n$.

By definition of $g_0$, it is locally isometric to $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g_{\\text{eucl}})$.

Synge’s theorem states that any compact even-dimensional orientable manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature is simply connected; therefore $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m}, g_0)$ must be simply connected.**\nThis statement makes a crucial error in its premise. The version of Synge's theorem provided in the problem (and its standard formulation) requires *strictly positive* sectional curvature ($K > 0$), not merely non-negative ($K \\ge 0$). The manifold $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m}, g_0)$ has $K \\equiv 0$, so it does not satisfy the strict inequality. Furthermore, the conclusion that $\\mathbb{T}^{2m}$ must be simply connected is false; as we showed in point $3$, its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{T}^{2m}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{2m}$, which is non-trivial for $m \\ge 1$. The flat torus is the classic counterexample demonstrating that the strict positivity condition in Synge's theorem cannot be weakened to non-negativity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The fundamental group of $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^n$, so in even dimension the simply-connectedness conclusion of Synge’s theorem cannot be deduced without the strict positivity of sectional curvature.**\nAs shown in point $3$, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{T}^n) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^n$. For any even dimension $n=2m \\ge 2$, the manifold $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m}, g_0)$ is compact, orientable, and has non-negative sectional curvature ($K \\equiv 0$). However, it is not simply connected. This demonstrates that if the hypothesis of Synge's theorem is weakened from $K > 0$ to $K \\ge 0$, the conclusion of simple-connectedness no longer holds. Therefore, the strict positivity of sectional curvature is an essential hypothesis. The statement accurately captures this fact.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. In odd dimension, Synge’s theorem predicts non-orientability under positive sectional curvature; thus $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m+1}, g_0)$ provides a counterexample.**\nThis statement misrepresents the theorem. The problem states that for a compact, odd-dimensional manifold, positive sectional curvature implies *orientability*. This statement claims the opposite, that it predicts *non-orientability*. This is fundamentally wrong. Secondly, $(\\mathbb{T}^{2m+1}, g_0)$ has $K \\equiv 0$ and thus does not satisfy the hypothesis of positive sectional curvature. A manifold cannot be a counterexample to a theorem whose hypotheses it does not meet.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E.

As detailed in point $4$ of our analysis, the deck transformations for the covering $p \\colon \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{T}^n$ are the integer translations. Translations are rigid motions whose differentials are the identity map, which has determinant $1$. Since the deck transformations are orientation-preserving, the orientation of the simply connected cover $\\mathbb{R}^n$ projects to a consistent orientation on the quotient $\\mathbb{T}^n$.
