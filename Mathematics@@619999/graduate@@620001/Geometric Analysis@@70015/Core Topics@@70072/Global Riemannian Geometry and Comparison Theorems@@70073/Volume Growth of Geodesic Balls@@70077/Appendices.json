The problem provides the convention for the Riemann curvature tensor as $R(X,Y)Z = \\nabla_{X}\\nabla_{Y}Z - \\nabla_{Y}\\nabla_{X}Z - \\nabla_{[X,Y]}Z$ and the sectional curvature as $K(\\sigma) = \\langle R(u,v)v, u \\rangle$ for any orthonormal vectors $u, v$ spanning the $2$-plane $\\sigma$. The $(0,4)$-tensor is $R(X,Y,Z,W) = \\langle R(X,Y)Z, W \\rangle$.\n\nWe first determine the algebraic form of the Riemann curvature tensor. For a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the Riemann tensor is given by\n$$R(X,Y,Z,W) = K \\left( \\langle X,W \\rangle \\langle Y,Z \\rangle - \\langle X,Z \\rangle \\langle Y,W \\rangle \\right)$$\nwhere we use $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ to denote the metric $g(\\cdot, \\cdot)$. This form possesses all the standard symmetries of the Riemann tensor:\n$1$. Skew-symmetry in the first two arguments: $R(X,Y,Z,W) = -R(Y,X,Z,W)$.\n$2$. Skew-symmetry in the last two arguments: $R(X,Y,Z,W) = -R(X,Y,W,Z)$.\n$3$. Symmetry of pairs: $R(X,Y,Z,W) = R(Z,W,X,Y)$.\n$4$. The first Bianchi identity: $R(X,Y,Z,W) + R(Y,Z,X,W) + R(Z,X,Y,W) = 0$.\nThe fact that this is the unique form follows from a theorem by Elie Cartan, which states that any tensor with these symmetries at a point is determined by its associated sectional curvatures. If the sectional curvature is constant, the tensor must be a constant multiple of the tensor $L(X,Y,Z,W) = \\langle X,W \\rangle \\langle Y,Z \\rangle - \\langle X,Z \\rangle \\langle Y,W \\rangle$. By choosing an orthonormal pair $\\{u,v\\}$, the sectional curvature of the plane spanned by them is $R(u,v,v,u)$. For our proposed form, this is $K(\\langle u,u \\rangle \\langle v,v \\rangle - \\langle u,v \\rangle^2) = K(1 \\cdot 1 - 0^2) = K$. Since the problem specifies $K \\equiv -1$, the Riemann tensor for $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is\n$$R(X,Y,Z,W) = - \\left( \\langle X,W \\rangle \\langle Y,Z \\rangle - \\langle X,Z \\rangle \\langle Y,W \\rangle \\right)$$\nFrom this, we can find the $(1,3)$-version of the tensor. From the definition $R(X,Y,Z,W) = \\langle R(X,Y)Z, W \\rangle$, we have:\n$$\\langle R(X,Y)Z, W \\rangle = \\langle Y,Z \\rangle \\langle X,W \\rangle - \\langle X,Z \\rangle \\langle Y,W \\rangle$$\nThis is true for all $W$. By non-degeneracy of the metric, we can identify the vector $R(X,Y)Z$:\n$$R(X,Y)Z = -(g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y)$$\nNow we compute the Ricci tensor, $\\mathrm{Ric}$. By definition, $\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z)$ is the trace of the linear map $X \\mapsto R(X,Y)Z$. Let $\\{e_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a local orthonormal basis at a point $p$. The trace is given by\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(R(e_i, Y)Z, e_i)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R$, we get\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(-[g(Y,Z)e_i - g(e_i,Z)Y], e_i)$$\nBy linearity of the metric,\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( g(Y,Z)g(e_i, e_i) - g(e_i,Z)g(Y,e_i) \\right)$$\nSince $\\{e_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis, $g(e_i, e_j) = \\delta_{ij}$. Thus, $g(e_i, e_i) = 1$.\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y,Z) - \\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y,e_i)g(Z,e_i) \\right)$$\nThe first sum is $\\sum_{i=1}^n g(Y,Z) = n \\cdot g(Y,Z)$. The second sum is the expression for the inner product $g(Y,Z)$ in the orthonormal basis $\\{e_i\\}$. Therefore,\n$$\\mathrm{Ric}(Y,Z) = - \\left( n \\cdot g(Y,Z) - g(Y,Z) \\right) = -(n-1)g(Y,Z)$$\nSo the Ricci tensor is $\\mathrm{Ric} = -(n-1)g$.\n\nNext, we justify the geodesic completeness of $\\mathbb{H}^n$ using the Poincaré ball model $(B^n, g)$, where $B^n = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : \\|x\\| < 1 \\}$ and the metric is $g = \\frac{4}{(1-\\|x\\|^2)^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n dx_i^2$. We show that the boundary $\\partial B^n$ is at infinite distance from any interior point. Consider a radial path from the origin to a point on the boundary, parametrized by $\\gamma(t) = (t, 0, \\dots, 0)$ for $t \\in [0, 1)$. The tangent vector is $\\gamma'(t) = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)$. The Euclidean norm squared of the position is $\\|\\gamma(t)\\|^2 = t^2$. The speed of the curve with respect to the metric $g$ is\n$$\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|_g = \\sqrt{g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t))} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{(1-t^2)^2} \\cdot 1^2} = \\frac{2}{1-t^2}$$\nThe length of the curve from the origin to a radial distance $R \\in [0,1)$ is\n$$L(\\gamma|_{[0,R]}) = \\int_0^R \\frac{2}{1-t^2} dt = \\int_0^R \\left(\\frac{1}{1+t} + \\frac{1}{1-t}\\right) dt = \\left[ \\ln(1+t) - \\ln(1-t) \\right]_0^R = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+R}{1-R}\\right)$$\nAs the endpoint of the curve approaches the boundary, i.e., as $R \\to 1^-$, the distance diverges:\n$$\\lim_{R \\to 1^-} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+R}{1-R}\\right) = +\\infty$$\nThis shows that the boundary sphere $\\partial B^n$ is at an infinite distance from the origin. By symmetry, the distance from any interior point to any boundary point is infinite. A Riemannian manifold is metrically complete if every Cauchy sequence of points converges to a point within the manifold. In $(B^n, g)$, any sequence converging to the boundary in the Euclidean sense would have infinite length, and thus cannot be a Cauchy sequence with respect to the hyperbolic metric $g$. Therefore, any Cauchy sequence in $(B^n, g)$ must converge to a point in $B^n$, which means the space is a complete metric space. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, a connected Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete if and only if it is complete as a metric space. Thus, $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is geodesically complete.\n\nFinally, we consider the volume growth. In a space of constant sectional curvature $K$, the metric in geodesic polar coordinates $(r, \\theta^1, \\dots, \\theta^{n-1})$ centered at a point $p$ takes the form $ds^2 = dr^2 + S_K(r)^2 d\\Omega_{n-1}^2$, where $d\\Omega_{n-1}^2$ is the standard metric on the $(n-1)$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. For $K=-1$, the function $S_{-1}(r)$ is the solution to the Jacobi equation $f''(r) - f(r) = 0$ with initial conditions $f(0)=0$ and $f'(0)=1$, which is $f(r)=\\sinh(r)$. Thus, the metric is\n$$g = dr^2 + (\\sinh r)^2 g_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$$\nThe volume element is $dV = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} dr d\\theta^1 \\dots d\\theta^{n-1}$. In these coordinates, this becomes $dV = (\\sinh r)^{n-1} dV_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} \\wedge dr$. The term $(\\sinh r)^{n-1}$ is the volume density factor. The volume of a geodesic ball $B_R(p)$ of radius $R$ is\n$$\\operatorname{Vol}(B_R(p)) = \\int_0^R \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} (\\sinh r)^{n-1} dV_{\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} dr = \\operatorname{Vol}(\\mathbb{S}^{n-1}) \\int_0^R (\\sinh r)^{n-1} dr$$\nFor large $r$, $\\sinh r = \\frac{e^r - e^{-r}}{2} \\sim \\frac{1}{2} e^r$. Thus, $(\\sinh r)^{n-1} \\sim \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} e^{(n-1)r}$. The integral for large $R$ is dominated by its upper limit:\n$$\\int_0^R (\\sinh r)^{n-1} dr \\approx \\int_0^R \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} e^{(n-1)r} dr = \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}(n-1)} [e^{(n-1)r}]_0^R \\approx \\frac{e^{(n-1)R}}{2^{n-1}(n-1)}$$\nThis demonstrates that the volume of a geodesic ball grows exponentially with the radius, on the order of $\\exp((n-1)R)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the closed-form expression for the Ricci tensor, which we derived as $\\mathrm{Ric}(X,Y) = -(n-1)g(X,Y)$.

For a fixed $z$, the region in the $xy$-plane is a disk $x^2+y^2 \\le R^2-z^2$, whose area is $\\pi(R^2-z^2)$.\n$$V_M(R) = \\int_{z=-\\pi r_c}^{\\pi r_c} \\text{Area}(z) \\, dz = \\int_{-\\pi r_c}^{\\pi r_c} \\pi(R^2 - z^2) \\, dz$$\nThe integrand is an even function of $z$, so we can simplify the calculation:\n$$V_M(R) = 2\\pi \\int_{0}^{\\pi r_c} (R^2 - z^2) \\, dz$$\n$$V_M(R) = 2\\pi \\left[ R^2 z - \\frac{z^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{\\pi r_c}$$\n$$V_M(R) = 2\\pi \\left( R^2 (\\pi r_c) - \\frac{(\\pi r_c)^3}{3} \\right)$$\n$$V_M(R) = 2\\pi^2 r_c R^2 - \\frac{2\\pi^4 r_c^3}{3}$$\nThis expression is valid for $R > \\pi r_c$. We can see that for large $R$, the volume grows as $R^2$.\n\nThe problem asks for the limit $L = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{V_M(R)}{R^2}$.\n$$L = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\pi^2 r_c R^2 - \\frac{2\\pi^4 r_c^3}{3}}{R^2}$$\n$$L = \\lim_{R \\to \\infty} \\left( 2\\pi^2 r_c - \\frac{2\\pi^4 r_c^3}{3R^2} \\right)$$\nAs $R \\to \\infty$, the second term goes to zero.\n$$L = 2\\pi^2 r_c$$\nThis result shows that while the manifold $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$ has non-negative (in fact, zero) Ricci curvature, its volume growth is of order $R^2$, which is strictly less than the $R^3$ growth of the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a key example illustrating the Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem, where the strict inequality in volume growth is due to the non-simply connected topology of the manifold.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\pi^{2} r_{c}}$$", "id": "1625653"}]}
