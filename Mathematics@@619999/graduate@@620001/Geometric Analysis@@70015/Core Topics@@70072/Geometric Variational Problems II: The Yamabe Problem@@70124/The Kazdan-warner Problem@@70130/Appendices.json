I will proceed with the solution and option-by-option analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Solution and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the transformation law for the scalar curvature under a conformal change of metric. Let the metric $\\hat g$ be conformally related to $g$ by $\\hat g = e^{2f} g$ for some smooth function $f$. The scalar curvatures are related by the formula:\n$$ R_{\\hat g} e^{2f} = R_g - 2(n-1)\\Delta_g f - (n-1)(n-2) |\\nabla f|_g^2 $$\nIn this problem, the conformal change is given by $\\hat g = u^{\\frac{4}{n-2}} g$. This corresponds to setting $e^{2f} = u^{\\frac{4}{n-2}}$, which implies $2f = \\frac{4}{n-2} \\ln u$, or $f = \\frac{2}{n-2} \\ln u$. From this, we compute the derivatives of $f$:\n$$ \\nabla f = \\frac{2}{n-2} \\frac{\\nabla u}{u} $$\n$$ \\Delta_g f = \\nabla_g \\cdot \\nabla_g f = \\operatorname{div}_g\\left( \\frac{2}{n-2} \\frac{\\nabla u}{u} \\right) = \\frac{2}{n-2} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta_g u}{u} - \\frac{|\\nabla u|_g^2}{u^2} \\right) $$\nSubstituting these into the scalar curvature transformation law:\n$$ R_{\\hat g} u^{\\frac{4}{n-2}} = R_g - 2(n-1) \\left[ \\frac{2}{n-2} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta_g u}{u} - \\frac{|\\nabla u|_g^2}{u^2} \\right) \\right] - (n-1)(n-2) \\left| \\frac{2}{n-2} \\frac{\\nabla u}{u} \\right|_g^2 $$\n$$ R_{\\hat g} u^{\\frac{4}{n-2}} = R_g - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\frac{\\Delta_g u}{u} + \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\frac{|\\nabla u|_g^2}{u^2} - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\frac{|\\nabla u|_g^2}{u^2} $$\nThe terms involving $|\\nabla u|_g^2$ cancel out.\n$$ R_{\\hat g} u^{\\frac{4}{n-2}} = R_g - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\frac{\\Delta_g u}{u} $$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $u$ gives:\n$$ R_{\\hat g} u^{\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} = R_g u - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\Delta_g u $$\nThis equation is fundamental for evaluating the given options.\n\n**A. Evaluation**\nThe statement is: For $n \\ge 3$, if $\\hat g = u^{\\frac{4}{n-2}} g$ with $u > 0$, then $u$ satisfies the semilinear Partial Differential Equation (PDE)\n$$ - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\Delta_g u + R_g u = R_{\\hat g} u^{\\frac{n+2}{n-2}}. $$\nBy rearranging the formula derived above, we get exactly this equation. This is the well-known equation for the prescribed scalar curvature problem in a conformal class.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Evaluation**\nThe statement is: The conformal Laplacian $L_g := - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2}\\Delta_g + R_g$ is conformally covariant in the sense that, for all smooth $\\varphi$ and all $u>0$ with $\\hat g = u^{\\frac{4}{n-2}} g$,\n$$ L_{\\hat g}(\\varphi) = u^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} L_g(u\\,\\varphi). $$\nThis property is the reason for the specific definition of the conformal Laplacian. We can prove it using the transformation laws for the scalar curvature and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = u^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} L_g(u\\varphi) = u^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \\left( -\\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2}\\Delta_g(u\\varphi) + R_g (u\\varphi) \\right) $$\nUsing the Leibniz rule for the Laplacian, $\\Delta_g(u\\varphi) = u \\Delta_g \\varphi + \\varphi \\Delta_g u + 2 \\langle \\nabla u, \\nabla \\varphi \\rangle_g$.\n$$ \\text{RHS} = u^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \\left[ \\varphi \\left(-\\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2}\\Delta_g u + R_g u \\right) - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\left( u \\Delta_g\\varphi + 2\\langle\\nabla u, \\nabla\\varphi\\rangle_g \\right) \\right] $$\nThe term in the first parenthesis is $L_g(u)$. From option A, we know $L_g(u) = R_{\\hat g} u^{\\frac{n+2}{n-2}}$. Substituting this:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = u^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \\left[ \\varphi R_{\\hat g} u^{\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\left( u \\Delta_g\\varphi + 2\\langle\\nabla u, \\nabla\\varphi\\rangle_g \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\text{RHS} = R_{\\hat g}\\varphi - u^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\left( u \\Delta_g\\varphi + 2\\langle\\nabla u, \\nabla\\varphi\\rangle_g \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{RHS} = R_{\\hat g}\\varphi - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} u^{-\\frac{4}{n-2}} \\left( \\Delta_g\\varphi + \\frac{2}{u}\\langle\\nabla u, \\nabla\\varphi\\rangle_g \\right) $$\nThe transformation law for the Laplacian is $\\Delta_{\\hat g} \\varphi = u^{-\\frac{4}{n-2}} \\left( \\Delta_g\\varphi + \\frac{2}{u}\\langle\\nabla u, \\nabla\\varphi\\rangle_g \\right)$.\nSubstituting this into the RHS expression:\n$$ \\text{RHS} = R_{\\hat g}\\varphi - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\Delta_{\\hat g}\\varphi = L_{\\hat g}(\\varphi) $$\nThis matches the left-hand side (LHS). Thus, the covariance relation holds.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Evaluation**\nThe statement is: On the standard round sphere $(S^n,g_{\\mathrm{round}})$ with $n \\ge 3$, every smooth function $f$ is the scalar curvature of some metric conformal to $g_{\\mathrm{round}}$.\nThis is a famous problem in geometry, known as the Nirenberg problem on the sphere. The question is whether the equation from A, $L_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} u = f u^{\\frac{n+2}{n-2}}$, has a positive solution $u$ for any smooth function $f$.\nThe work of Kazdan and Warner showed that this is not true. There exist obstructions. For a function $f$ to be the scalar curvature of a metric conformal to the standard sphere metric, it must satisfy certain integral conditions, known as the Kazdan-Warner obstructions. For example, any function $f$ of the form $f(x) = \\langle \\nabla h(x), V(x) \\rangle_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}}$ where $V$ is a conformal Killing field which is not a Killing field is an obstruction to the problem, unless $f$ is identically zero. A simpler, explicit counterexample is $f(x)=x_1$ (the restriction of the first coordinate function of the ambient $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ to $S^n$), which cannot be the scalar curvature of any metric conformal to $g_{\\text{round}}$. Therefore, the statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Evaluation**\nThe statement is: If the first eigenvalue of $L_g$ is positive, then any smooth function $f$ that is positive somewhere is the scalar curvature of some metric conformal to $g$; however, when the conformal class has nontrivial conformal vector fields (for example on $S^n$), such an $f$ must also satisfy the Kazdan–Warner identities\n$$ \\int_M \\langle \\nabla f, X \\rangle \\, d\\mu_{\\hat g} = 0\\quad \\text{for all conformal Killing fields } X \\text{ of } \\hat g. $$\nThis statement is composed of two parts. The first claim is \"If the first eigenvalue of $L_g$ is positive, then any smooth function $f$ that is positive somewhere is the scalar curvature of some metric conformal to $g$\". This is not universally true. It is a known result by Kazdan and Warner that this holds if $(M,g)$ has no non-trivial conformal vector fields. However, if such vector fields exist, as they do for the standard sphere $(S^n, g_{\\mathrm{round}})$, then there are obstructions. On $S^n$, the operator $L_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} = -\\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2}\\Delta_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} + n(n-1)$ has a positive first eigenvalue, $n(n-1)$, but as established in the analysis of option C, not every function $f$ can be a scalar curvature. Thus, the first part of the statement is false. Since a false statement is claimed to be a theorem, the entire statement is incorrect, regardless of the correctness of the appended qualification. The qualification itself points to the reason why the first claim is false, making the sentence structure logically flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Evaluation**\nThe statement is: In dimension $n=2$, with $\\hat g = e^{2\\phi} g$, the formula in option A still holds when $u = e^{\\frac{n-2}{2}\\phi}$, so that\n$$ - \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\Delta_g u + R_g u = R_{\\hat g} u^{\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} $$\nremains valid at $n=2$.\nThe formula from option A is explicitly for $n \\ge 3$. It contains the term $\\frac{1}{n-2}$, which is singular at $n=2$. Substituting $n=2$ directly into the formula leads to division by zero, for example, in the coefficient $-\\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2}$. Moreover, the exponent $\\frac{n+2}{n-2}$ is also undefined at $n=2$.\nWhile it is true that a careful limiting process as $n \\to 2$ recovers the correct 2D transformation law ($R_{\\hat g}e^{2\\phi} = R_g - 2\\Delta_g \\phi$), this does not mean the formula itself \"remains valid at $n=2$\". For an expression to be valid, it must be well-defined. The given expression is not well-defined at $n=2$. For example, for a fixed function $\\phi$, when $n=2$, $u=e^0=1$, so $\\Delta_g u = 0$. The first term becomes an indeterminate form $-\\frac{4}{0} \\times 0$. A mathematical statement must be precise, and this one is not. The formula as written is not valid for $n=2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3035791"}, {"introduction": "With the foundational equations established, we now move from abstract principles to concrete computation.

We are asked to compute the total scalar curvature of a specific metric on the $n$-torus, which is conformally related to the flat metric.\n\nLet $(\\mathbb{T}^{n}, g_{0})$ be the flat $n$-torus, where $n \\ge 3$. The scalar curvature of the flat metric $g_{0}$ is $R_{g_{0}} = 0$.

In standard coordinates $(x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n})$ on the torus, it is given by $\\Delta_{g_{0}} = -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x_{i}^{2}}$.\n\nSince the base metric $g_{0}$ is flat, we have $R_{g_{0}} = 0$. The formula for the scalar curvature of $g_{u}$ simplifies to:\n$$\nR_{g_{u}} = c_{n} u^{-\\frac{n+2}{n-2}} \\Delta_{g_{0}} u\n$$\nWe need to compute the total scalar curvature, which is the integral of $R_{g_{u}}$ with respect to the volume form $d\\mu_{g_{u}}$ of the metric $g_{u}$.

The linearization of the scalar curvature map is given by $D R_g(h) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\vert_{t=0} R_{g_t}$.\n\nUsing the product rule, we have:\n$$\nD R_g(h) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\Big\\vert_{t=0} (g_t^{ij} R_{ij}(g_t)) = \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\Big\\vert_{t=0} g_t^{ij}\\right) R_{ij}(g) + g^{ij} \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}\\Big\\vert_{t=0} R_{ij}(g_t)\\right)\n$$\nThe variation of the inverse metric is $\\frac{d}{dt}\\vert_{t=0} g_t^{ij} = -h^{ij}$. Thus, the first term is $-h^{ij}R_{ij} = -\\langle h, \\operatorname{Ric}_g \\rangle_g$.\nThe second term requires the variation of the Ricci tensor, $\\dot{R}_{ij} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\vert_{t=0} R_{ij}(g_t)$. This is a standard, though intricate, calculation in differential geometry. It begins with the variation of the Levi-Civita connection.\n\nThe variation of the Christoffel symbols, $\\dot{\\Gamma}^k_{ij} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\vert_{t=0} \\Gamma^k_{ij}(g_t)$, defines a $(1,2)$-tensor field $S$ with components:\n$$\nS^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl}(\\nabla_i h_{jl} + \\nabla_j h_{il} - \\nabla_l h_{ij})\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of $g$. The variation of the Riemann curvature tensor $R^k_{lij}$ can then be expressed in terms of covariant derivatives of $S$:\n$$\n\\dot{R}^k_{lij} = \\nabla_i S^k_{lj} - \\nabla_j S^k_{li}\n$$\nThe variation of the Ricci tensor is found by tracing the variation of the Riemann tensor:\n$$\n\\dot{R}_{lj} = \\dot{R}^i_{lij} = \\nabla_i S^i_{lj} - \\nabla_j S^i_{li}\n$$\nThe term we need for the variation of scalar curvature is the trace of this quantity, $g^{lj}\\dot{R}_{lj}$. A detailed calculation shows that this trace can be expressed as:\n$$\ng^{lj} \\dot{R}_{lj} = \\Delta_g(\\operatorname{tr}_g h) + \\delta_g(\\delta_g h)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_g = g^{ij}\\nabla_i\\nabla_j$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on functions, $\\operatorname{tr}_g h = g^{ij}h_{ij}$ is the trace of $h$, and $\\delta_g(\\delta_g h) = \\nabla^i\\nabla^j h_{ij}$.\n\nCombining the terms, we arrive at the full expression for the linearization of the scalar curvature:\n$$\nD R_g(h) = \\Delta_g(\\operatorname{tr}_g h) + \\delta_g(\\delta_g h) - \\langle h, \\operatorname{Ric}_g \\rangle_g\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear differential operator in $h$. The principal part, consisting of terms with two covariant derivatives of $h$, is explicitly given by $\\Delta_g(\\operatorname{tr}_g h) + \\delta_g(\\delta_g h) = g^{kl}\\nabla_k\\nabla_l(g^{pq}h_{pq}) + \\nabla^i\\nabla^j h_{ij}$.\n\n### Task 2: The $L^2$-Formal Adjoint $D R_g^*$\n\nThe $L^2$-formal adjoint $D R_g^*$ of $D R_g$ is a map from smooth functions to symmetric $(0,2)$-tensors, $D R_g^*: C^{\\infty}(M) \\to \\Gamma(S^2 T^*M)$, defined by the relation:\n$$\n\\int_M u \\, D R_g(h) \\, d\\mu_g = \\int_M \\langle D R_g^*(u), h \\rangle_g \\, d\\mu_g\n$$\nfor all smooth functions $u$ and all smooth symmetric $(0,2)$-tensors $h$. We substitute the expression for $D R_g(h)$ and use integration by parts on the closed manifold $M$ (so all boundary terms vanish).\n\nWe analyze the three terms of $D R_g(h)$ separately:\n1.  Term 1: $\\int_M u \\, \\Delta_g(\\operatorname{tr}_g h) \\, d\\mu_g$.\n    Using Green's second identity (integration by parts twice), we have $\\int_M u (\\Delta_g f) \\, d\\mu_g = \\int_M (\\Delta_g u) f \\, d\\mu_g$ for any functions $u, f$. Let $f = \\operatorname{tr}_g h$.\n    $$\n    \\int_M u \\, \\Delta_g(\\operatorname{tr}_g h) \\, d\\mu_g = \\int_M (\\Delta_g u) (\\operatorname{tr}_g h) \\, d\\mu_g\n    $$\n    Since $\\operatorname{tr}_g h = g^{ij}h_{ij} = \\langle g, h \\rangle_g$, this becomes:\n    $$\n    \\int_M (\\Delta_g u) \\langle g, h \\rangle_g \\, d\\mu_g = \\int_M \\langle (\\Delta_g u) g, h \\rangle_g \\, d\\mu_g\n    $$\n    This implies the first component of $D R_g^*(u)$ is $(\\Delta_g u) g$.\n\n2.  Term 2: $\\int_M u \\, (\\delta_g\\delta_g h) \\, d\\mu_g = \\int_M u \\, (\\nabla^i\\nabla^j h_{ij}) \\, d\\mu_g$.\n    We integrate by parts twice. The divergence theorem on a closed manifold ensures boundary terms are zero.\n    \\begin{align*} \\int_M u (\\nabla^i\\nabla^j h_{ij}) \\, d\\mu_g &= - \\int_M (\\nabla_i u) (\\nabla^j h_{ij}) \\, d\\mu_g \\\\ &= \\int_M (\\nabla^j\\nabla_i u) h_{ij} \\, d\\mu_g \\end{align*}\n    The term $(\\nabla^j\\nabla_i u) h_{ij}$ is the scalar obtained by contracting the contravariant tensor with components $\\nabla^j\\nabla_i u = g^{jk}g^{il}\\nabla_k\\nabla_l u$ with the covariant tensor $h$. This is precisely the pointwise inner product $\\langle \\nabla^2 u, h \\rangle_g$, where $\\nabla^2 u$ is the Hessian tensor of $u$ with components $(\\nabla^2 u)_{ij} = \\nabla_i\\nabla_j u$.\n    $$\n    \\int_M (\\nabla^j\\nabla_i u) h_{ij} \\, d\\mu_g = \\int_M \\langle \\nabla^2 u, h \\rangle_g \\, d\\mu_g\n    $$\n    This implies the second component of $D R_g^*(u)$ is the Hessian $\\nabla^2 u$.\n\n3.  Term 3: $\\int_M u \\, (-\\langle h, \\operatorname{Ric}_g \\rangle_g) \\, d\\mu_g$.\n    This term is already in the desired form by linearity of the inner product:\n    $$\n    \\int_M u \\, (-\\langle h, \\operatorname{Ric}_g \\rangle_g) \\, d\\mu_g = \\int_M \\langle -u \\operatorname{Ric}_g, h \\rangle_g \\, d\\mu_g\n    $$\n    This implies the third component of $D R_g^*(u)$ is $-u \\operatorname{Ric}_g$.\n\nCombining these three components, we obtain the expression for the formal adjoint operator:\n$$\nD R_g^*(u) = (\\Delta_g u) g + \\nabla^2 u - u \\operatorname{Ric}_g\n$$\n\n### Task 3: Specialization to the Sphere $(S^n, g_{\\mathrm{rnd}})$\n\nWe now specialize to the standard round sphere $(S^n, g_{\\mathrm{rnd}})$ of constant sectional curvature $1$, for $n \\geq 3$. We are given that its Ricci tensor is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}} = (n-1) g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}$. We need to compute $D R_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}}^*(1)$, which means we apply the adjoint operator to the constant function $u(x) = 1$.\n\nLet $u=1$. We evaluate each term in the expression for $D R_g^*(u)$:\n1.  The gradient of a constant function is zero: $\\nabla(1) = 0$.\n2.  The Laplace-Beltrami operator applied to $u=1$ is $\\Delta_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}}(1) = \\operatorname{div}_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}}(\\nabla(1)) = \\operatorname{div}_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}}(0) = 0$. So, the term $(\\Delta_g u) g$ is zero.\n3.  The Hessian of $u=1$ has components $(\\nabla^2 1)_{ij} = \\nabla_i(\\nabla_j 1) = \\nabla_i(0) = 0$. So, the term $\\nabla^2 u$ is the zero tensor.\n4.  The term $-u \\operatorname{Ric}_g$ becomes $-1 \\cdot \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}} = -\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for the adjoint gives:\n$$\nD R_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}}^*(1) = 0 \\cdot g_{\\mathrm{rnd}} + 0 - \\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}} = -\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}}\n$$\nNow, we use the given identity for the Ricci tensor of the round sphere, $\\operatorname{Ric}_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}} = (n-1) g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}$:\n$$\nD R_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}}^*(1) = -(n-1) g_{\\mathrm{rnd}} = (1-n) g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the constant $c(n)$ such that $D R_{g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}}^*(1) = c(n) \\, g_{\\mathrm{rnd}}$. By comparing our result with this expression, we identify the constant as:\n$$\nc(n) = 1-n\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the constant $c(n)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1-n}$$", "id": "3035788"}]}
