Assume the flow preserves spherical symmetry so that $S^{n}(R(t))$ remains round for as long as the solution exists, with initial radius $R(0)=R_{0}>0$. Starting from the definitions of mean curvature as the trace of the shape operator and the evolution law of MCF, derive the ordinary differential equation satisfied by the radius $R(t)$ and determine the extinction time $T$ at which the sphere shrinks to a point (i.e., $R(T)=0$). In your derivation, justify the monotonicity of $R(t)$ using the avoidance principle for disjoint hypersurfaces evolving by MCF.

The outward unit normal vector at $\\mathbf{X}$ is $\\nu = \\frac{\\mathbf{X}}{R} = p$.\n\nThe velocity of a point on the sphere is given by the time derivative of its position vector:\n$$\n\\partial_t \\mathbf{X}(p, t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(R(t)p) = \\frac{dR}{dt}p\n$$\nThe problem states the evolution equation is $\\partial_t \\mathbf{X} = -H\\nu$. For a convex sphere to shrink, its velocity vector must point inward. As we have chosen $\\nu$ to be the outward normal, we require the scalar mean curvature $H$ to be positive.\n\nThe scalar mean curvature $H$ is the trace of the shape operator $A$. To ensure $H>0$ for an outward-pointing normal on a sphere, we adopt the convention that the shape operator $A(v)$ is the derivative of the normal vector field $\\nu$ along a tangent vector $v$, i.e., $A(v) = D_v \\nu$.\n\nFor the sphere, with $\\nu = \\mathbf{X}/R$, the shape operator acting on a tangent vector $v$ (where $v$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{X}$) is:\n$$\nA(v) = D_v \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{X}}{R} \\right) = \\frac{1}{R} D_v \\mathbf{X} = \\frac{1}{R}v\n$$\nThis shows that the shape operator is $A = \\frac{1}{R}I$, where $I$ is the identity map on the tangent space.

The avoidance principle states that two disjoint compact hypersurfaces evolving by MCF will remain disjoint. If we consider two concentric spheres, $S_1$ and $S_2$, with initial radii $R_1(0) < R_2(0)$, the principle implies that their subsequent evolutions remain disjoint, meaning their radii must satisfy $R_1(t) < R_2(t)$. More fundamentally, the principle prevents self-intersection. For a single convex surface like our sphere, the velocity vector $\\partial_t \\mathbf{X} = -H\\nu = -\\frac{n}{R}\\nu$ points strictly inward at every point. The avoidance principle ensures that the surface at a later time $t+\\delta t$ must lie strictly in the region bounded by the surface at time $t$.
