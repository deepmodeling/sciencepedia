Let the transformed coordinates be $\\tilde{x} = \\lambda x$ and $\\tilde{t} = \\lambda^{2} t$. So, $v(x,t) = u(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t})$. We compute the terms in $Q[v](x,t)$ using the chain rule.\n\nFirst, the time derivative term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial_{t} v(x,t)}{v(x,t)} = \\frac{1}{u(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} u(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t}) = \\frac{1}{u(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\tilde{t}}(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t}) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{t}}{\\partial t} \\right) = \\frac{(\\partial_{\\tilde{t}} u)(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})}{u(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})} \\cdot \\lambda^{2}.\n$$\nNext, the spatial gradient term. The gradient of $v$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla_x v(x,t) = \\nabla_x u(\\lambda x, \\lambda^2 t).\n$$\nFor the $i$-th component, the chain rule gives $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x_i} = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\tilde{x}_j} \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{x}_j}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\tilde{x}_i} \\lambda$. Thus:\n$$\n\\nabla_x v(x,t) = \\lambda (\\nabla_{\\tilde{x}} u)(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t}).\n$$\nThe squared norm of the gradient of $v$, divided by $v^2$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\nabla_x v(x,t)|^{2}}{v(x,t)^{2}} = \\frac{|\\lambda (\\nabla_{\\tilde{x}} u)(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t})|^{2}}{u(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t})^{2}} = \\lambda^{2} \\frac{|(\\nabla_{\\tilde{x}} u)(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t})|^{2}}{u(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t})^{2}}.\n$$\nNow, we assemble $Q[v](x,t)$:\n$$\nQ[v](x,t) = t \\left( \\frac{|\\nabla_x v|^{2}}{v^{2}} - \\frac{\\partial_{t} v}{v} \\right) = t \\left( \\lambda^{2} \\frac{|(\\nabla_{\\tilde{x}} u)(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})|^{2}}{u(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})^{2}} - \\lambda^{2} \\frac{(\\partial_{\\tilde{t}} u)(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})}{u(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})} \\right).\n$$\nFactoring out $\\lambda^2$ and regrouping:\n$$\nQ[v](x,t) = (\\lambda^{2} t) \\left( \\frac{|(\\nabla_{\\tilde{x}} u)(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})|^{2}}{u(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})^{2}} - \\frac{(\\partial_{\\tilde{t}} u)(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})}{u(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})} \\right).\n$$\nRecognizing that $\\tilde{t} = \\lambda^2 t$ and the expression in the parenthesis is precisely $Q[u]$ evaluated at $(\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t})$:\n$$\nQ[S_{\\lambda} u](x,t) = \\tilde{t} \\left( \\frac{|\\nabla u|^{2}}{u^{2}} - \\frac{\\partial_{t} u}{u} \\right)\\bigg|_{(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{t})} = Q[u](\\tilde{x}, \\tilde{t}) = Q[u](\\lambda x, \\lambda^{2} t).\n$$\nThis completes the proof.\n\nPart 3: Evaluation of $Q$ for the self-similar solution\n\nWe evaluate $Q[u_{a,c}]$ for the self-similar solution found in Part 1, where $a=n/2$. The solution is $u_{n/2,c}(x,t) = c t^{-n/2} \\exp(-|x|^{2}/(4t))$, which is the fundamental solution of the heat equation for the specified normalization constant $c=(4\\pi)^{-n/2}$.\n\nFrom the calculations in Part 1, we have for $u=u_{a,c}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial_t u}{u} = -\\frac{a}{t} + \\frac{|x|^2}{4t^2}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\frac{|\\nabla u|^2}{u^2} = |\\nabla(\\ln u)|^2 = \\frac{|x|^2}{4t^2}.\n$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $Q$:\n$$\nQ[u_{a,c}](x,t) = t \\left( \\frac{|x|^{2}}{4t^{2}} - \\left( -\\frac{a}{t} + \\frac{|x|^{2}}{4t^{2}} \\right) \\right).\n$$\nSimplifying the expression inside the parenthesis:\n$$\nQ[u_{a,c}](x,t) = t \\left( \\frac{|x|^{2}}{4t^{2}} + \\frac{a}{t} - \\frac{|x|^{2}}{4t^{2}} \\right) = t \\left( \\frac{a}{t} \\right) = a.\n$$\nThe value of $Q$ for this family of solutions is simply the exponent $a$. From Part 1, we found that for $u_{a,c}$ to be a solution to the heat equation, we must have $a = n/2$.\nTherefore, for the fundamental solution, the value of $Q$ is:\n$$\nQ[u_{n/2,c}](x,t) = \\frac{n}{2}.\n$$\nThis value is a constant, independent of the variables $(x,t)$ and the normalization constant $c$.\n\nPart 4: Deduction of the constant $c(n)$\n\nWe are asked to deduce a unique constant $c(n)$ associated with a scale-invariant Harnack-type quantity built from $Q[u]$. A Harnack-type inequality provides a universal bound on a quantity for a class of solutions. For the heat equation, a well-known example is the Li-Yau gradient estimate. A scale-invariant inequality is one that holds for a solution $u$ if and only if it holds for its parabolic rescalings $S_{\\lambda}u$.\n\nLet's consider a simple Harnack-type inequality of the form $Q[u](x,t) \\leq C$ or $Q[u](x,t) \\geq C$ for some constant $C$. The scaling property $Q[S_{\\lambda} u](x,t) = Q[u](\\lambda x, \\lambda^{2} t)$ from Part 2 ensures that such an inequality is consistent with parabolic scaling. If $Q[u](y,s) \\leq C$ for all $(y,s)$, then for $v=S_\\lambda u$, $Q[v](x,t) = Q[u](\\lambda x, \\lambda^2 t) \\leq C$, so the inequality also holds for $v$.\n\nThe problem states that this constant $c(n)$ is \"unique\" and determined by \"saturation by the self-similar solution\". Saturation means that equality is achieved for a particular solution. The self-similar solution, or fundamental solution, is the canonical choice for such a saturating case because it represents the fundamental mode of heat diffusion from a point source.\n\nIn Part 3, we computed the value of $Q$ for the fundamental solution and found it to be a constant:\n$$\nQ[\\text{fundamental solution}] = \\frac{n}{2}.\n$$\nIf a universal inequality of the form $Q[u] \\leq c(n)$ or $Q[u] \\geq c(n)$ exists, it must be satisfied by all positive solutions, including the fundamental solution.\nThis implies two possibilities:\n1. If the inequality is $Q[u] \\leq c(n)$, then we must have $\\frac{n}{2} \\leq c(n)$.\n2. If the inequality is $Q[u] \\geq c(n)$, then we must have $\\frac{n}{2} \\geq c(n)$.\n\nThe principle of saturation asserts that the fundamental solution realizes the extremal value, meaning that the inequality becomes an equality. This determines the constant uniquely. The constant $c(n)$ must be the value attained by the saturating solution.\nTherefore, the unique constant consistent with parabolic invariance and saturation by the self-similar fundamental solution is the value of $Q$ for that solution.\n\nBased on the calculation in Part 3, this constant is:\n$$\nc(n) = \\frac{n}{2}.\n$$\nThis corresponds to the sharp Li-Yau-Hamilton inequality for the heat equation on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is $Q[u] \\le \\frac{n}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3029084"}, {"introduction": "A central theme in geometric analysis is understanding how the geometry of a space influences the behavior of analysis upon it.

The on-diagonal heat kernel expansion for $S^n$ is\n$$\nu(t,y) = p(t,y,y) = \\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^{n/2}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{n(n-1)}{6}t + O(t^2) \\right).\n$$\nNow we compute $\\ln u(t,y)$:\n$$\n\\ln u(t,y) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{1}{(4\\pi t)^{n/2}} \\right) + \\ln\\left( 1 + \\frac{n(n-1)}{6}t + O(t^2) \\right).\n$$\nUsing the Taylor expansion $\\ln(1+z) = z - z^2/2 + \\dots$ for small $z$, we get\n$$\n\\ln u(t,y) = -\\frac{n}{2}\\ln(4\\pi) - \\frac{n}{2}\\ln(t) + \\frac{n(n-1)}{6}t + O(t^2).\n$$\nThe first non-Euclidean term in this expansion is $\\frac{n(n-1)}{6}t$, which is the leading term dependent on curvature.\n\nNext, we differentiate with respect to $t$ to find the second part of $Q(t,y)$:\n$$\n\\partial_t \\ln u(t,y) = -\\frac{n}{2t} + \\frac{n(n-1)}{6} + O(t).\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Q(t,y)$:\n$$\nQ(t,y) = - \\left( -\\frac{n}{2t} + \\frac{n(n-1)}{6} + O(t) \\right) = \\frac{n}{2t} - \\frac{n(n-1)}{6} - O(t).\n$$\nThe problem defines the error $E(t)$ as the difference between the Li-Yau quantity for Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and the one for $S^n$. In Euclidean space, the heat kernel is $p_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(t,x,y) = (4\\pi t)^{-n/2} \\exp(-|x-y|^2/4t)$. The on-diagonal part is $u_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(t,x) = (4\\pi t)^{-n/2}$.\n$\\ln u_{\\mathbb{R}^n} = -\\frac{n}{2}\\ln(4\\pi t)$.\n$\\partial_t \\ln u_{\\mathbb{R}^n} = -\\frac{n}{2t}$.\n$\\nabla_x \\ln u_{\\mathbb{R}^n} = 0$.\nSo, the Euclidean benchmark is\n$$\nQ_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(t) = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{n}{2t}\\right) = \\frac{n}{2t}.\n$$\nThis matches the provided benchmark.\n\nNow, we compute the error $E(t)$:\n$$\nE(t) = Q_{\\mathbb{R}^n}(t) - Q(t,y) = \\frac{n}{2t} - \\left( \\frac{n}{2t} - \\frac{n(n-1)}{6} - O(t) \\right).\n$$\n$$\nE(t) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{6} + O(t).\n$$\nThe problem asks for the leading-order term of $E(t)$ as $t \\to 0^+$. This is the limit of $E(t)$ as $t \\to 0^+$:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to 0^+} E(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\left( \\frac{n(n-1)}{6} + O(t) \\right) = \\frac{n(n-1)}{6}.\n$$\nThe leading-order term is the constant $\\frac{n(n-1)}{6}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)}{6}}$$", "id": "3029035"}]}
