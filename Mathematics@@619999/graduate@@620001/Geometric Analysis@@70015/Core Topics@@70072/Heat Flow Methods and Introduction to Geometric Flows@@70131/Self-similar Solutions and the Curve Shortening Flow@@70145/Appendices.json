The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n- **Verdict**: The problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the ODE for the Profile Curve $\\Gamma$**\n\nLet the profile curve $\\Gamma$ be parameterized by a position vector $X$. A point on the evolving curve $\\gamma(t)$ is given by the position vector $x(t) = \\sqrt{-t} X$. The parameter $t$ is less than $0$.\n\nThe velocity of a point on the curve, for a fixed corresponding point $X$ on $\\Gamma$, is given by the partial derivative with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\partial_t x(t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\sqrt{-t} X) = -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-t}} X\n$$\nSubstituting $X = x(t) / \\sqrt{-t}$, we can write the velocity in terms of the instantaneous position vector $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\partial_t x(t) = -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-t}} \\left(\\frac{x(t)}{\\sqrt{-t}}\\right) = -\\frac{x(t)}{2(-t)}\n$$\nThe Curve Shortening Flow equation $\\partial_t \\gamma = \\kappa \\mathbf{n}$ states that the velocity vector of the curve is purely normal. This means the normal component of the velocity of any parameterization must equal $\\kappa$. Let's denote the geometric quantities of $\\gamma(t)$ with a subscript $\\gamma$ and those of $\\Gamma$ with a subscript $\\Gamma$. The normal component of the velocity is $(\\partial_t x) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_\\gamma$. The CSF equation is thus:\n$$\n(\\partial_t x) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_\\gamma = \\kappa_\\gamma\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\partial_t x$:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{x(t)}{2(-t)}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_\\gamma = \\kappa_\\gamma\n$$\nNext, we relate the geometric quantities of $\\gamma(t)$ to those of the profile curve $\\Gamma$. The curve $\\gamma(t)$ is a scaled version of $\\Gamma$ by a factor $\\lambda(t) = \\sqrt{-t}$.\n- The position vectors are related by $x = \\lambda X$.\n- The arclength elements are related by $ds_\\gamma = \\lambda ds_\\Gamma = \\sqrt{-t} ds_\\Gamma$.\n- The unit tangent and unit normal vectors are invariant under uniform scaling: $T_\\gamma = T_\\Gamma$ and $\\mathbf{n}_\\gamma = \\mathbf{n}_\\Gamma$.\n- The curvature scales inversely with the scaling factor: $\\kappa_\\gamma = \\kappa_\\Gamma / \\lambda = \\kappa_\\Gamma / \\sqrt{-t}$.\n\nSubstituting these relations into the CSF equation:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{-t} X}{2(-t)}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_\\Gamma = \\frac{\\kappa_\\Gamma}{\\sqrt{-t}}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{-t}} (X \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_\\Gamma) = \\frac{\\kappa_\\Gamma}{\\sqrt{-t}}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{-t}$ yields the time-independent equation for the profile curve $\\Gamma$:\n$$\n\\kappa_\\Gamma = -\\frac{1}{2} \\langle X, \\mathbf{n}_\\Gamma \\rangle\n$$\nHere, $\\langle X, \\mathbf{n}_\\Gamma \\rangle$ is the dot product of the position vector $X$ on $\\Gamma$ with the inward unit normal $\\mathbf{n}_\\Gamma$ at that point. This is the ordinary differential equation (in a geometric sense) satisfied by the stationary profile curve $\\Gamma$.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Radius $R$ of the Round Circle Profile**\n\nWe now consider the case where $\\Gamma$ is a round circle of radius $R$ centered at the origin.\nFor such a circle:\n- A point on the circle is given by a position vector $X$ with constant magnitude $|X| = R$.\n- The inward-pointing unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}_\\Gamma$ at a point $X$ is directed towards the origin, so it is anti-parallel to the position vector: $\\mathbf{n}_\\Gamma = -X / |X| = -X / R$.\n- The scalar curvature $\\kappa_\\Gamma$ of a circle of radius $R$ is constant and is given by $\\kappa_\\Gamma = 1/R$.\n\nWe substitute these properties of the circle into the derived ODE for $\\Gamma$:\n$$\n\\kappa_\\Gamma = -\\frac{1}{2} \\langle X, \\mathbf{n}_\\Gamma \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left\\langle X, -\\frac{X}{R} \\right\\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{1}{2R} \\langle X, X \\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\langle X, X \\rangle = |X|^2 = R^2$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{1}{2R} (R^2) = \\frac{R}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $R$:\n$$\n2 = R^2 \\implies R = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThe radius must be positive, so we take the positive root. The unique round circle stationary profile has a radius $R=\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Functional $F[\\Gamma]$**\n\nThe final task is to compute the value of the functional $F[\\Gamma]$ for this specific profile curve $\\Gamma$, which is a circle of radius $R=\\sqrt{2}$ centered at the origin. The functional is defined as:\n$$\nF[\\Gamma] = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\int_{\\Gamma} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{|x|^{2}}{4}\\right)\\, ds\n$$\nThe integration is along the curve $\\Gamma$. For any point $x$ on this circle, its position vector has magnitude $|x|=R=\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $|x|^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$.\n\nThe integrand $\\exp(-|x|^2/4)$ is constant everywhere on $\\Gamma$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2}{4}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSince the integrand is constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n$$\nF[\\Gamma] = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\int_{\\Gamma} ds\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{\\Gamma} ds$ is the total arclength of the curve $\\Gamma$, which is the circumference of the circle. The circumference $L$ is given by $L = 2\\pi R$. With $R=\\sqrt{2}$, the length is:\n$$\nL = 2\\pi\\sqrt{2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this length back into the expression for $F[\\Gamma]$:\n$$\nF[\\Gamma] = (4\\pi)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) (2\\pi\\sqrt{2})\n$$\nWe simplify the expression:\n$$\nF[\\Gamma] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) (2\\pi\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) (2\\pi\\sqrt{2})\n$$\nThe factors of $2$ in the numerator and denominator cancel:\n$$\nF[\\Gamma] = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = (\\sqrt{\\pi}\\sqrt{2}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nF[\\Gamma] = \\sqrt{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the exact value of the functional for the round circle stationary profile.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}$$", "id": "3033436"}, {"introduction": "Having identified the round circle as a fundamental self-similar solution, we must now investigate its stability, a key question in the analysis of any equilibrium.

Evolution Equation for the Rescaled Curve**\nThe rescaled curve is $Y(\\tau,s) = (T-t)^{-1/2} X(t,s)$ with $\\tau = -\\ln(T-t)$.\nWe compute the velocity $\\partial_{\\tau} Y$. The chain rule gives $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{dt}{d\\tau} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = (T-t)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$.\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} Y = (T-t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ (T-t)^{-1/2} X \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} Y = (T-t) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(T-t)^{-3/2} X + (T-t)^{-1/2} \\partial_{t} X \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} Y = \\frac{1}{2} (T-t)^{-1/2} X + (T-t)^{1/2} \\partial_{t} X\n$$\nSubstituting $Y = (T-t)^{-1/2} X$ and the CSF law $\\partial_t X = \\kappa n$:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} Y = \\frac{1}{2} Y + (T-t)^{1/2} \\kappa n\n$$\nThe curvature $\\kappa$ of the original curve $X$ and the curvature $\\tilde{\\kappa}$ of the rescaled curve $Y$ are related by the scaling factor. Since $Y=c X$ with $c=(T-t)^{-1/2}$, we have $\\tilde{\\kappa} = \\kappa/c = (T-t)^{1/2}\\kappa$. The unit normal vector is invariant under isotropic scaling, so $n = \\tilde{n}$.\nSubstituting $\\kappa = (T-t)^{-1/2}\\tilde{\\kappa}$ and $n=\\tilde{n}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} Y = \\frac{1}{2} Y + (T-t)^{1/2} \\left[ (T-t)^{-1/2}\\tilde{\\kappa} \\right] \\tilde{n} = \\frac{1}{2} Y + \\tilde{\\kappa} \\tilde{n}\n$$\nThis is the evolution equation for the rescaled curve $Y$. Note that the velocity vector $\\partial_{\\tau} Y$ is generally not normal to the curve $Y$, as it has a tangential component $\\frac{1}{2}Y \\cdot \\tilde{T}$, where $\\tilde{T}$ is the unit tangent to $Y$.\n\n**2.2. Linearization around the Stationary Circle**\nThe stationary solution is a circle $Y_0$ of radius $R_0 = \\sqrt{2}$, centered at the origin. We can parameterize it by angle $\\theta$ as $Y_0(\\theta) = \\sqrt{2} e_r(\\theta)$. For this circle, the inward unit normal is $n_0 = -e_r(\\theta)$ and its curvature is $\\tilde{\\kappa}_0 = 1/R_0 = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe stationarity condition $\\partial_{\\tau}Y_0 = 0$ implies $0 = \\frac{1}{2}Y_0 + \\tilde{\\kappa}_0 n_0$, which is satisfied:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{2} e_r) + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(-e_r) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})e_r = 0\n$$\nThe perturbed curve is given as $Y(\\tau,\\theta) = \\sqrt{2}\\,e_{r}(\\theta) + u(\\tau,\\theta)\\,n_{0}(\\theta)$. Using $n_0 = -e_r$, this is $Y(\\theta) = (\\sqrt{2} - u) e_r(\\theta)$. This is a curve given in polar coordinates by the radius function $r(\\theta) = \\sqrt{2} - u(\\theta)$.\n\nThe evolution of the graph function $u$ is determined by the normal velocity of the curve, $V_N = (\\partial_{\\tau} Y) \\cdot \\tilde{n}$. The tangential component of the velocity corresponds to a reparameterization along the curve and does not affect the shape, hence it does not contribute to the evolution of $u$ in this frame.\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} u \\approx V_N = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} Y + \\tilde{\\kappa} \\tilde{n}\\right) \\cdot \\tilde{n} = \\frac{1}{2} Y \\cdot \\tilde{n} + \\tilde{\\kappa}\n$$\nWe need to linearize the terms $Y \\cdot \\tilde{n}$ and $\\tilde{\\kappa}$ in powers of $u$ and its derivatives. Let $R_0=\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n_Linearization of Curvature_ $\\tilde{\\kappa}$:\nFor a curve given in polar coordinates $r(\\theta)$, the curvature is $\\kappa = \\frac{|r^2 + 2(r')^2 - r r''|}{(r^2 + (r')^2)^{3/2}}$.\nWith $r = R_0 - u(\\theta)$, we have $r' = -u'$ and $r'' = -u''$.\nTo first order in $u$:\n$r^2 + 2(r')^2 - r r'' \\approx (R_0-u)^2 - (R_0-u)(-u'') \\approx R_0^2 - 2R_0 u + R_0 u''$.\n$(r^2+(r')^2)^{3/2} \\approx ((R_0-u)^2)^{3/2} \\approx (R_0^2-2R_0 u)^{3/2} = R_0^3 (1-2u/R_0)^{3/2} \\approx R_0^3(1-3u/R_0)$.\n$$\n\\tilde{\\kappa} \\approx \\frac{R_0^2 - 2R_0 u + R_0 u''}{R_0^3(1-3u/R_0)} \\approx \\frac{1}{R_0}\\left(1-\\frac{2u}{R_0}+\\frac{u''}{R_0}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{3u}{R_0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\kappa} \\approx \\frac{1}{R_0}\\left(1+\\frac{u}{R_0}+\\frac{u''}{R_0}\\right) = \\tilde{\\kappa}_0 + \\frac{u+u''}{R_0^2}\n$$\nSo, the first-order variation in curvature is $\\delta\\tilde{\\kappa} = \\frac{u+u_{\\theta\\theta}}{R_0^2}$.\n\n_Linearization of_ $Y \\cdot \\tilde{n}$:\nThe inward unit normal vector for the curve $r(\\theta)$ is $\\tilde{n} = \\frac{-r e_r + r' e_\\theta}{\\sqrt{r^2+(r')^2}}$.\nWith $r=R_0-u$ and $r'=-u'$, linearizing gives:\n$$\n\\tilde{n} \\approx \\frac{-(R_0-u)e_r - u' e_\\theta}{\\sqrt{R_0^2-2R_0u}} \\approx \\frac{-R_0 e_r + u e_r - u' e_\\theta}{R_0(1-u/R_0)} \\approx (-e_r + \\frac{u}{R_0}e_r - \\frac{u'}{R_0}e_\\theta)(1+\\frac{u}{R_0})\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{n} \\approx -e_r - \\frac{u'}{R_0}e_\\theta = n_0 - \\frac{u'}{R_0}e_\\theta\n$$\nNow we compute $Y \\cdot \\tilde{n}$:\n$$\nY \\cdot \\tilde{n} \\approx \\left((R_0-u)e_r\\right) \\cdot \\left(-e_r - \\frac{u'}{R_0} e_\\theta\\right) = -(R_0-u) \\approx -R_0+u\n$$\nThe zeroth order part is $-R_0 = -\\sqrt{2}$, and the first order part is $u$.\n\n_The Linearized PDE_:\nSubstitute the linearized terms into the equation for $\\partial_{\\tau}u$:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} u \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(-R_0+u) + \\left(\\tilde{\\kappa}_0 + \\frac{u+u_{\\theta\\theta}}{R_0^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} u \\approx \\left(-\\frac{R_0}{2} + \\tilde{\\kappa}_0\\right) + \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{u+u_{\\theta\\theta}}{R_0^2}\n$$\nThe zeroth-order term $(-\\frac{R_0}{2} + \\tilde{\\kappa}_0) = (-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}) = 0$, as expected for a stationary solution.\nThe first-order terms give the linearized PDE for $u$:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} u = \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{u+u_{\\theta\\theta}}{R_0^2}\n$$\nSubstituting $R_0^2 = 2$:\n$$\n\\partial_{\\tau} u = \\frac{u}{2} + \\frac{u+u_{\\theta\\theta}}{2} = u + \\frac{1}{2}u_{\\theta\\theta}\n$$\nThis is the required linearized partial differential equation.\n\n**2.3.

In each case, initialize at $s=0$ with $x(0) = (x_{0}, y_{0})$ and $\\theta(0) = \\theta_{0}$:\n1. $x_{0} = \\sqrt{2}$, $y_{0} = 0$, $\\theta_{0} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n2. $x_{0} = 1$, $y_{0} = 0$, $\\theta_{0} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n3. $x_{0} = 2$, $y_{0} = 0$, $\\theta_{0} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n4. $x_{0} = \\sqrt{2}$, $y_{0} = 0.1$, $\\theta_{0} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nAll angles must be treated in radians. There are no physical units for lengths; treat them as dimensionless. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the eight results aggregated as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order\n$[\\mathrm{err}_{1}, \\mathrm{closed}_{1}, \\mathrm{err}_{2}, \\mathrm{closed}_{2}, \\mathrm{err}_{3}, \\mathrm{closed}_{3}, \\mathrm{err}_{4}, \\mathrm{closed}_{4}]$,\nwhere each $\\mathrm{err}_{i}$ is a floating-point number and each $\\mathrm{closed}_{i}$ is a boolean, corresponding respectively to the closure error and near-closure indicator for test case $i$.", "solution": "The posed problem is scientifically sound, mathematically well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard exercise in the field of geometric analysis, specifically concerning self-similar solutions to the curve shortening flow. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and numerical solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the ODE System\n\nThe objective is to derive an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system for the state of a curve described by its position $x(s) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and turning angle $\\theta(s)$, where $s$ is the arc-length parameter. The state of the system at any point $s$ along the curve can be described by the vector $Y(s) = (x_1(s), x_2(s), \\theta(s))$, where $x(s) = (x_1(s), x_2(s))$. We must find the derivative $Y'(s) = \\frac{dY}{ds}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following fundamental relationships based on an arc-length parametrization:\n1.  The derivative of the position vector $x(s)$ is the unit tangent vector $\\mathbf{t}(s)$:\n    $$x'(s) = \\mathbf{t}(s)$$\n2.  The unit tangent vector is defined by the turning angle $\\theta(s)$:\n    $$\\mathbf{t}(s) = (\\cos\\theta(s), \\sin\\theta(s))$$\n3.  The derivative of the turning angle is the signed curvature $k(s)$:\n    $$\\theta'(s) = k(s)$$\n\nCombining the first two points gives the first two ODEs of our system, describing the evolution of the position components:\n$$x_1'(s) = \\cos\\theta(s)$$\n$$x_2'(s) = \\sin\\theta(s)$$\n\nTo find the third ODE for $\\theta'(s)$, we use the definitional relation $\\theta'(s) = k(s)$ and the given shrinker equation, which must be satisfied by any homothetically shrinking self-similar solution:\n$$k(s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle x(s), \\mathbf{n}(s)\\rangle$$\nHere, $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the Euclidean inner product in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and $\\mathbf{n}(s)$ is the outward unit normal. The problem specifies the outward normal corresponding to the given tangent vector:\n$$\\mathbf{n}(s) = (\\sin\\theta(s), -\\cos\\theta(s))$$\nThis normal is obtained by a clockwise rotation of the tangent vector $\\mathbf{t}(s)$ by $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians, which is consistent with an outward-pointing normal for a curve traversed in the counter-clockwise direction (i.e., with increasing $\\theta$).\n\nBy equating the two expressions for curvature, we have:\n$$\\theta'(s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle x(s), \\mathbf{n}(s)\\rangle$$\nWe can now substitute the component forms of $x(s) = (x_1(s), x_2(s))$ and $\\mathbf{n}(s)$:\n$$\\theta'(s) = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle (x_1(s), x_2(s)), (\\sin\\theta(s), -\\cos\\theta(s)) \\rangle$$\n$$\\theta'(s) = \\frac{1}{2} (x_1(s)\\sin\\theta(s) - x_2(s)\\cos\\theta(s))$$\nThis provides the third ODE for our system.\n\nIn summary, the complete system of first-order autonomous ODEs governing the profile of a self-similar shrinker in arc-length parametrization is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx_1'(s) = \\cos\\theta(s) \\\\\nx_2'(s) = \\sin\\theta(s) \\\\\n\\theta'(s) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1(s)\\sin\\theta(s) - x_2(s)\\cos\\theta(s))\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Solution Strategy\n\nTo solve this ODE system numerically, we will use an adaptive-step-size integrator. The `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function is ideally suited for this task. It provides robust algorithms (such as the default Runge-Kutta method `RK45`) and, crucially, supports event detection.\n\nThe problem requires integrating from an initial state $(x(0), \\theta(0))$ until the turning angle $\\theta(s)$ has increased by exactly $2\\pi$. This is a terminal event problem. We define an event function that tracks the value $\\theta(s) - (\\theta(0) + 2\\pi)$. The integration is stopped when this function crosses zero from negative to positive.\n\nFor each of the four test cases specified:\n1.  An initial state vector $Y(0) = (x_{1,0}, x_{2,0}, \\theta_0)$ is constructed.\n2.  The event function is defined relative to the specific initial angle $\\theta_0$.\n3.  `solve_ivp` is called with the ODE system, a sufficiently large integration interval for the arc length $s$ (e.g., $s \\in [0, 50]$), the initial state, and the event function.\n4.  Upon successful termination by the event, the solver returns the state $Y(s_{\\mathrm{end}})$ at the precise arc length $s_{\\mathrm{end}}$ where $\\theta(s_{\\mathrm{end}}) = \\theta_0 + 2\\pi$.\n5.  The closure error is computed as the Euclidean distance between the final position $x(s_{\\mathrm{end}}) = (x_{1}(s_{\\mathrm{end}}), x_{2}(s_{\\mathrm{end}}))$ and the initial position $x(0) = (x_{1,0}, x_{2,0})$:\n    $$\\mathrm{err} = \\|x(s_{\\mathrm{end}}) - x(0)\\| = \\sqrt{(x_1(s_{\\mathrm{end}})-x_{1,0})^2 + (x_2(s_{\\mathrm{end}})-x_{2,0})^2}$$\n6.  A boolean indicator for near-closure is determined by comparing the closure error to the tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-3}$:\n    $$\\mathrm{closed} = (\\mathrm{err} < \\tau)$$\n\nThe first test case, with $x(0) = (\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ and $\\theta(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, corresponds to an initial condition on a circle of radius $R = \\sqrt{2}$ centered at the origin. It is a known result that such a circle is a closed self-similar shrinker. Therefore, for this case, we expect the numerical integration to yield a closure error that is very close to zero, limited only by the precision of the numerical solver. The other test cases correspond to perturbations or different initial conditions, for which the curve is not expected to close.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and numerically solves the ODE system for a self-similar shrinker\n    under the curve shortening flow, and computes diagnostics for a given set of\n    initial conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)\n    # State vector y = [x1, x2, theta]\n    # Independent variable s = arc length\n    def ode_system(s, y):\n        \"\"\"\n        The ODE system for the shrinker profile.\n        y[0]: x-coordinate of the curve\n        y[1]: y-coordinate of the curve\n        y[2]: turning angle theta\n        \"\"\"\n        x1, x2, theta = y\n        dx1_ds = np.cos(theta)\n        dx2_ds = np.sin(theta)\n        # k = d(theta)/ds = 0.5 * <x, n>\n        dtheta_ds = 0.5 * (x1 * np.sin(theta) - x2 * np.cos(theta))\n        return [dx1_ds, dx2_ds, dtheta_ds]\n\n    # Test suite of initial conditions at s=0\n    # Format: (x0, y0, theta0)\n    test_cases = [\n        (np.sqrt(2), 0.0, np.pi / 2),\n        (1.0, 0.0, np.pi / 2),\n        (2.0, 0.0, np.pi / 2),\n        (np.sqrt(2), 0.1, np.pi / 2),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    TOLERANCE = 1e-3\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        x0, y0, theta0 = case\n        initial_pos = np.array([x0, y0])\n        initial_state = np.array([x0, y0, theta0])\n\n        # Define the event function to stop integration when theta increases by 2*pi\n        def stop_event(s, y):\n            # The event occurs when y[2] - (theta0 + 2*pi) = 0\n            return y[2] - (theta0 + 2 * np.pi)\n\n        stop_event.terminal = True  # Stop integration when event occurs\n        stop_event.direction = 1  # Event triggers on zero-crossing from negative to positive\n\n        # Integrate the ODE system. s_span is chosen to be large enough\n        # to ensure the event occurs for all test cases.\n        s_span = [0, 50]\n        sol = solve_ivp(\n            ode_system,\n            s_span,\n            initial_state,\n            method='RK45',\n            events=stop_event,\n            dense_output=True,\n            atol=1e-9,  # Stricter tolerances for higher accuracy\n            rtol=1e-9,\n        )\n        \n        if sol.status == 1 and len(sol.t_events[0]) > 0:\n            # Event was successfully triggered\n            s_end = sol.t_events[0][0]\n            final_state = sol.sol(s_end)\n            final_pos = final_state[:2]\n\n            # Compute diagnostics\n            closure_error = np.linalg.norm(final_pos - initial_pos)\n            is_near_closed = closure_error < TOLERANCE\n            \n            results.append(closure_error)\n            results.append(is_near_closed)\n        else:\n            # Integration failed or did not trigger event, which indicates an issue.\n            # Append NaN and False for robustness.\n            results.append(float('nan'))\n            results.append(False)\n\n    # Format the output as a single comma-separated list string.\n    # str(bool) gives 'True'/'False', which is acceptable.\n    output_str = ','.join(map(str, results))\n    print(f\"[{output_str}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "3033431"}]}
