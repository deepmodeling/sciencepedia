The boundary of this region is formed by three mutually orthogonal, grounded, infinite conducting planes at $x=0$, $y=0$, and $z=0$.\n\nThe electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ within the region $\\Omega$ can be determined using the method of images. This technique replaces the boundary conditions on the conducting planes with a set of image charges located outside the domain $\\Omega$. The locations and magnitudes of these image charges are chosen such that the superposition of the potential from the original charge and all image charges results in zero potential on the planes $x=0$, $y=0$, and $z=0$.\n\nThe force exerted on the original charge $q$ is then the vector sum of the electrostatic forces from all the image charges. The electrostatic force on a charge $q_1$ at position $\\mathbf{r}_1$ due to a charge $q_2$ at position $\\mathbf{r}_2$ is given by Coulomb's law:\n$$ \\mathbf{F} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q_1 q_2}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|^3}(\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2) $$\nwhere $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nYour task is to derive the component of the electrostatic force acting on the charge $q$ in the $z$-direction, denoted by $F_z$. Express your answer in terms of $q$, $\\epsilon_0$, and the coordinates of the charge's position $(x', y', z')$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the $z$-component of the force on a charge $q$ at $\\mathbf{r'} = (x', y', z')$ in the first octant, with grounded conducting planes at $x=0$, $y=0$, and $z=0$. We use the method of images to solve this problem.\n\n**1. Determine the Image Charges**\n\nTo satisfy the boundary condition $\\phi=0$ on the three planes, we introduce a set of image charges. The process involves reflecting the original charge and subsequent image charges across the planes.\n\n- The original charge is $+q$ at $(x', y', z')$.\n- Reflection across the $x=0$ plane yields an image charge of $-q$ at $(-x', y', z')$.\n- Reflection across the $y=0$ plane yields an image charge of $-q$ at $(x', -y', z')$.\n- Reflection across the $z=0$ plane yields an image charge of $-q$ at $(x', y', -z')$.\n\nThese single-reflection images ensure the potential is zero on one plane but not necessarily the others. We must also reflect these images.\n\n- Reflecting $(-x', y', z')$ across $y=0$ gives $+q$ at $(-x', -y', z')$.\n- Reflecting $(-x', y', z')$ across $z=0$ gives $+q$ at $(-x', y', -z')$.\n- Reflecting $(x', -y', z')$ across $z=0$ gives $+q$ at $(x', -y', -z')$.\n\nFinally, a triple-reflection is needed. For instance, reflecting $(-x', -y', z')$ across $z=0$ gives a charge of $-q$ at $(-x', -y', -z')$.\n\nIn total, there are 7 image charges. The positions of the source and image charges can be written as $\\mathbf{r}_\\sigma = (\\sigma_1 x', \\sigma_2 y', \\sigma_3 z')$ where $\\sigma_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$. The charge $q_\\sigma$ at position $\\mathbf{r}_\\sigma$ has a magnitude determined by the number of reflections needed to create it. A single reflection changes the sign of the charge. The charge at $\\mathbf{r}_\\sigma$ is $q_\\sigma = q(-1)^k$, where $k$ is the number of negative signs in the tuple $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3)$. The source charge corresponds to $k=0$ at $(x', y', z')$.\n\n**2.

In this case, $z' - (-1)z' = 2z'$. Thus, we only need to sum over the four image charges located in the region $z<0$.\n\nThe four image charges with $\\sigma_3 = -1$ are:\n1.  $\\sigma_a = (1, 1, -1)$: Position $\\mathbf{r}_a = (x', y', -z')$. Number of reflections is 1, so charge $q_a = -q$.\n2.  $\\sigma_b = (1, -1, -1)$: Position $\\mathbf{r}_b = (x', -y', -z')$. Number of reflections is 2, so charge $q_b = +q$.\n3.  $\\sigma_c = (-1, 1, -1)$: Position $\\mathbf{r}_c = (-x', y', -z')$.

Number of reflections is 3, so charge $q_d = -q$.\n\nNow we compute the squared distances $|\\mathbf{r'} - \\mathbf{r}_\\sigma|^2$:\n-   $|\\mathbf{r'} - \\mathbf{r}_a|^2 = (x'-x')^2 + (y'-y')^2 + (z'-(-z'))^2 = (2z')^2$.\n-   $|\\mathbf{r'} - \\mathbf{r}_b|^2 = (x'-x')^2 + (y'-(-y'))^2 + (z'-(-z'))^2 = (2y')^2 + (2z')^2$.\n-   $|\\mathbf{r'} - \\mathbf{r}_c|^2 = (x'-(-x'))^2 + (y'-y')^2 + (z'-(-z'))^2 = (2x')^2 + (2z')^2$.\n-   $|\\mathbf{r'} - \\mathbf{r}_d|^2 = (x'-(-x'))^2 + (y'-(-y'))^2 + (z'-(-z'))^2 = (2x')^2 + (2y')^2 + (2z')^2$.\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $F_z$:\n$$ F_z = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{q_a(2z')}{|\\mathbf{r'} - \\mathbf{r}_a|^3} + \\frac{q_b(2z')}{|\\mathbf{r'} - \\mathbf{r}_b|^3} + \\frac{q_c(2z')}{|\\mathbf{r'} - \\mathbf{r}_c|^3} + \\frac{q_d(2z')}{|\\mathbf{r'} - \\mathbf{r}_d|^3} \\right] $$\n\nLet's evaluate each term:\n-   Term 1 ($q_a=-q$): $\\frac{(-q)(2z')}{((2z')^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{-2qz'}{(2z')^3} = -\\frac{q}{4z'^2}$.\n-   Term 2 ($q_b=+q$): $\\frac{(+q)(2z')}{((2y')^2 + (2z')^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{2qz'}{8(y'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{qz'}{4(y'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}}$.\n-   Term 3 ($q_c=+q$): $\\frac{(+q)(2z')}{((2x')^2 + (2z')^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{2qz'}{8(x'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{qz'}{4(x'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}}$.\n-   Term 4 ($q_d=-q$): $\\frac{(-q)(2z')}{((2x')^2 + (2y')^2 + (2z')^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{-2qz'}{8(x'^2+y'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}} = -\\frac{qz'}{4(x'^2+y'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}}$.\n\nSumming these terms and pre-multiplying by $\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}$:\n$$ F_z = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ -\\frac{q}{4z'^2} + \\frac{qz'}{4(y'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}} + \\frac{qz'}{4(x'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}} - \\frac{qz'}{4(x'^2+y'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}} \\right] $$\nFactoring out common terms $\\frac{q}{4}$:\n$$ F_z = \\frac{q^2}{16\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{z'^2} + \\frac{z'}{(y'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}} + \\frac{z'}{(x'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}} - \\frac{z'}{(x'^2+y'^2+z'^2)^{3/2}} \\right] $$\nThis is the final expression for the $z$-component of the force.

Its boundary is $\\partial H = \\{ (\\xi', 0) : \\xi' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \\}$.\n\n**1. Construction of the Green's function $G_H(x,y)$:**\nWe use the method of images. For a point $y = (y', y_n) \\in H$, its reflection across the boundary $\\partial H$ is the point $\\tilde{y} = (y', -y_n)$, which lies outside $H$. The Green's function for the Dirichlet problem in $H$ is constructed as\n$$ G_H(x,y) = \\Phi(x-y) - \\Phi(x-\\tilde{y}) $$\nwhere $x, y \\in H$. For a fixed $y \\in H$, the function $x \\mapsto \\Phi(x-\\tilde{y})$ is harmonic in $H$ since $x \\neq \\tilde{y}$. Thus, $\\Delta_x G_H(x,y) = \\Delta_x \\Phi(x-y) = -\\delta_y$.\nFor any point $x \\in \\partial H$, we have $x = (x', 0)$. Then,\n$$ |x-y|^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + (0-y_n)^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + y_n^2 $$\n$$ |x-\\tilde{y}|^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + (0-(-y_n))^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + y_n^2 $$\nThus, $|x-y| = |x-\\tilde{y}|$, which implies $\\Phi(x-y) = \\Phi(x-\\tilde{y})$. Therefore, $G_H(x,y) = 0$ for $x \\in \\partial H$, satisfying the Dirichlet condition.\nFor $n \\geq 3$, the explicit form is:\n$$ G_H(x,y) = \\frac{1}{(n-2)\\omega_{n-1}} \\left( |x-y|^{2-n} - |x-\\tilde{y}|^{2-n} \\right) $$\n\n**2.

The outward unit normal vector to $H$ at a boundary point $y \\in \\partial H$ is $\\mathbf{n} = (0,\\dots,0,-1)$. Thus, the outward normal derivative is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_y} = \\nabla_y \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_n}$.\nThe Poisson kernel is therefore $P_H(x,\\xi') = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_n} G_H(x,y) \\Big|_{y=(\\xi',0)}$.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of $G_H(x,y)$ with respect to $y_n$ for $x=(x',x_n)$ and $y=(y',y_n)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_n} |x-y|^{2-n} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_n} \\left( |x'-y'|^2 + (x_n-y_n)^2 \\right)^{\\frac{2-n}{2}} = (n-2) (x_n-y_n) |x-y|^{-n} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_n} |x-\\tilde{y}|^{2-n} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_n} \\left( |x'-y'|^2 + (x_n+y_n)^2 \\right)^{\\frac{2-n}{2}} = -(n-2) (x_n+y_n) |x-\\tilde{y}|^{-n} $$\nCombining these, for $n \\geq 3$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G_H}{\\partial y_n} = \\frac{n-2}{(n-2)\\omega_{n-1}} \\left( \\frac{x_n-y_n}{|x-y|^n} + \\frac{x_n+y_n}{|x-\\tilde{y}|^n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{n-1}} \\left( \\frac{x_n-y_n}{|x-y|^n} + \\frac{x_n+y_n}{|x-\\tilde{y}|^n} \\right) $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at a boundary point $y = (\\xi', 0)$, i.e., $y' = \\xi'$ and $y_n = 0$.

Its boundary is the unit sphere $S^{n-1} = \\{ \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^n : |\\xi| = 1 \\}$.\n\n**1. Construction of the Green's function $G_B(x,y)$:**\nWe use the Kelvin transform. For a point $y \\in B \\setminus \\{0\\}$, its inversion with respect to the sphere $S^{n-1}$ is $\\tilde{y} = y/|y|^2$. For $y=0$, the reflection is at infinity.\nThe Green's function is given by\n$$ G_B(x,y) = \\Phi(x-y) - \\Phi(|y|(x-\\tilde{y})) $$\nFor $n \\geq 3$, this is $G_B(x,y) = \\frac{1}{(n-2)\\omega_{n-1}} \\left( |x-y|^{2-n} - ||y|x - y/|y||^{2-n} \\right)$.\nLet's verify the boundary condition for $x \\in S^{n-1}$, i.e., $|x|=1$.\n$$ ||y|x - y/|y||^2 = (|y|x - y/|y|) \\cdot (|y|x - y/|y|) = |y|^2|x|^2 - 2x\\cdot y + 1 = |y|^2 - 2x\\cdot y + 1 $$\nAlso, $|x-y|^2 = |x|^2-2x\\cdot y+|y|^2 = 1-2x\\cdot y+|y|^2$.\nFor $|x|=1$, we have $||y|x - y/|y||^2 = |x-y|^2$, which implies $G_B(x,y)=0$. The formula is also valid for $n=2$.\nThe expression can also be written in a more convenient form:\n$$ ||y|x-y/|y||^{2-n} = (|y|^2|x|^2 - 2 x\\cdot y+1)^{\\frac{2-n}{2}} $$\nSo, $G_B(x,y) = \\frac{1}{(n-2)\\omega_{n-1}} \\left( |x-y|^{2-n} - (|y|^2|x|^2 - 2 x\\cdot y+1)^{\\frac{2-n}{2}} \\right)$ for $n \\ge 3$.\n\n**2. Computation of the Poisson kernel $P_B(x,\\xi)$:**\nThe outward unit normal at $y \\in S^{n-1}$ is $\\mathbf{n}_y = y$. The normal derivative is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_y} = y \\cdot \\nabla_y$. The Poisson kernel is $P_B(x,\\xi) = - (y \\cdot \\nabla_y G_B(x,y)) \\Big|_{y=\\xi}$, where $|\\xi|=1$.\nWe compute the gradient of each term in $G_B$ with respect to $y$, for $n \\ge 3$:\n$$ \\nabla_y |x-y|^{2-n} = (2-n)|x-y|^{-n}(y-x) $$\n$$ \\nabla_y (|y|^2|x|^2 - 2 x\\cdot y+1)^{\\frac{2-n}{2}} = \\frac{2-n}{2}(\\dots)^{\\frac{-n}{2}} \\nabla_y(|y|^2|x|^2 - 2 x\\cdot y+1) = (2-n)(\\dots)^{\\frac{-n}{2}} (|x|^2y - x) $$\nNow, we take the dot product with $y$:\n$$ y \\cdot \\nabla_y |x-y|^{2-n} = (2-n)|x-y|^{-n}(|y|^2 - x\\cdot y) $$\n$$ y \\cdot \\nabla_y (\\dots)^{\\frac{2-n}{2}} = (2-n)(\\dots)^{\\frac{-n}{2}} (|x|^2|y|^2 - x\\cdot y) $$\nSo, for $y=\\xi \\in S^{n-1}$ (where $|\\xi|=1$):\nFirst term: $(2-n)|x-\\xi|^{-n}(1 - x\\cdot \\xi)$.\nSecond term: The base of the power becomes $|\\xi|^2|x|^2 - 2x\\cdot\\xi+1 = |x|^2 - 2x\\cdot\\xi+1 = |x-\\xi|^2$. The derivative part becomes $|x|^2|\\xi|^2 - x\\cdot \\xi = |x|^2 - x\\cdot\\xi$. So the second term becomes $(2-n)|x-\\xi|^{-n}(|x|^2 - x\\cdot\\xi)$.\nPutting it all together:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G_B}{\\partial n_y}\\Big|_{y=\\xi} = \\frac{1}{(n-2)\\omega_{n-1}} \\left[ (2-n)|x-\\xi|^{-n}(1 - x\\cdot \\xi) - (2-n)|x-\\xi|^{-n}(|x|^2 - x\\cdot \\xi) \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{2-n}{(n-2)\\omega_{n-1}} |x-\\xi|^{-n} (1-x\\cdot\\xi - |x|^2 + x\\cdot\\xi) = -\\frac{1}{\\omega_{n-1}} \\frac{1-|x|^2}{|x-\\xi|^n} $$\nThe Poisson kernel is the negative of this expression:\n$$ P_B(x,\\xi) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{n-1}} \\frac{1-|x|^2}{|x-\\xi|^n} $$\nThis formula is valid for all $n \\geq 2$.\n\n### Part 3: Verification of the Boundary Approximation Identity\n\nWe need to show that for a continuous function $f$ on $\\partial\\Omega$, the Poisson integral $u_\\Omega(x) = \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) f(\\xi) d\\sigma(\\xi)$ satisfies $\\lim_{x\\to\\zeta} u_\\Omega(x) = f(\\zeta)$ for $\\zeta \\in \\partial\\Omega$.\nThis result follows from three key properties of the Poisson kernel $P_\\Omega(x,\\xi)$:\n1.  **Positivity:** $P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$ and $\\xi \\in \\partial\\Omega$.\n    For $H$, $P_H(x,\\xi') = \\frac{2x_n}{\\omega_{n-1}(|x'-\\xi'|^2 + x_n^2)^{n/2}} > 0$ since $x_n > 0$.\n    For $B$, $P_B(x,\\xi) = \\frac{1-|x|^2}{\\omega_{n-1}|x-\\xi|^n} > 0$ since $|x|  1$.\n2.  **Normalization:** $\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) d\\sigma(\\xi) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$.\n    This follows from considering the harmonic function $u(x)=1$ in $\\Omega$. Since $u$ has boundary values $f(\\xi)=1$, its solution via the Poisson integral must be $u(x)=1$, which implies the property.\n3.  **Localization:** For any $\\zeta \\in \\partial\\Omega$ and any $\\delta > 0$, $\\lim_{x\\to\\zeta} \\int_{\\partial\\Omega \\setminus B(\\zeta,\\delta)} P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) d\\sigma(\\xi) = 0$.\n    For $H$, as $x=(x',x_n) \\to \\zeta=(\\zeta',0)$, if $|\\xi'-\\zeta'| \\ge \\delta$, then $|x'-\\xi'| \\ge |\\xi'-\\zeta'|-|x'-\\zeta'| \\ge \\delta/2$ for $x'$ close to $\\zeta'$. The denominator of $P_H(x,\\xi')$ is bounded below, while the numerator $2x_n \\to 0$. The factor $x_n$ drives the integrand to zero uniformly outside any neighborhood of $\\zeta'$, and since the kernel decays sufficiently fast at infinity, the integral tends to zero.\n    For $B$, as $x \\to \\zeta \\in S^{n-1}$, if $|\\xi-\\zeta| \\ge \\delta$, the denominator $|x-\\xi|^n$ is bounded below away from zero.

By continuity of $f$ at $\\zeta$, there exists $\\delta > 0$ such that for any $\\xi \\in \\partial\\Omega$ with $|\\xi-\\zeta|\\delta$, we have $|f(\\xi)-f(\\zeta)|  \\epsilon/2$.\nWe split the integral over $\\partial\\Omega$ into two regions: $A = \\partial\\Omega \\cap B(\\zeta,\\delta)$ and $C = \\partial\\Omega \\setminus B(\\zeta,\\delta)$.\n$$ |u_\\Omega(x) - f(\\zeta)| \\le \\int_{A} P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) |f(\\xi) - f(\\zeta)| d\\sigma(\\xi) + \\int_{C} P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) |f(\\xi) - f(\\zeta)| d\\sigma(\\xi) $$\nThe first integral is bounded by:\n$$ \\int_{A} P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} d\\sigma(\\xi)  \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) d\\sigma(\\xi) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} $$\nFor the second integral, we assume $f$ is bounded on $\\partial\\Omega$, i.e., $|f(\\xi)| \\le M$ for some constant $M$. Then $|f(\\xi)-f(\\zeta)| \\le 2M$.\n$$ \\int_{C} P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) |f(\\xi) - f(\\zeta)| d\\sigma(\\xi) \\le 2M \\int_{C} P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) d\\sigma(\\xi) $$\nBy property 3, for the given $\\delta$, there exists a neighborhood $W$ of $\\zeta$ such that for all $x \\in W \\cap \\Omega$, the integral $\\int_C P_\\Omega(x,\\xi) d\\sigma(\\xi)  \\frac{\\epsilon}{4M}$.\nThus, for $x \\in W \\cap \\Omega$, the second integral is bounded by $2M \\cdot \\frac{\\epsilon}{4M} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$.\nCombining the bounds, for $x \\in W \\cap \\Omega$, we have $|u_\\Omega(x) - f(\\zeta)|  \\epsilon/2 + \\epsilon/2 = \\epsilon$.\nThis completes the verification that $\\lim_{x\\to\\zeta} u_\\Omega(x) = f(\\zeta)$ for both the upper half-space and the unit ball.

The Green's function $G(x,y)$ for the Laplacian operator $\\Delta$ on a domain $D$ with a source at $y \\in D$ is defined by the equation $-\\Delta_x G(x,y) = \\delta_y(x)$ with the boundary condition $G(x,y)=0$ for all $x \\in \\partial D$. The MoI attempts to construct this function by superposing the fundamental solution $\\Phi(x,y)$ with a set of potentials from image sources $\\{y_k\\}$ with strengths $\\{q_k\\}$, all located outside $D$. The proposed solution is of the form $G(x,y) = \\Phi(x,y) + \\sum_k q_k \\Phi(x, y_k)$. This method, particularly with a finite number of images, is only successful for domains whose boundaries possess very specific symmetries, such as those composed of hyperplanes and spheres. We will analyze each statement based on these principles.\n\n**Statement A:** In a two-dimensional wedge domain with opening angle $\\theta \\in (0,\\pi)$, the domain is $D = \\{ (r,\\phi) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : r>0, 0\\phi\\theta \\}$. The boundary consists of two rays. To enforce the $G=0$ condition on both rays, one must perform repeated reflections of the source. A source at $y=(r_0, \\phi_0)$ is reflected across the line $\\phi=0$ and the line $\\phi=\\theta$. The resulting images must then be reflected again, and so on. The group of isometries generated by reflections in two lines intersecting at an angle $\\theta$ is finite if and only if $\\theta$ is a rational multiple of $\\pi$. If $\\theta/\\pi = p/q$ is a rational number (with $p,q$ integers), the sequence of reflected image positions is finite, leading to a finite sum for the Green's function. If $\\theta/\\pi$ is an irrational number, the reflections generate a countably infinite set of distinct images, and the method requires an infinite series. Thus, the statement that the method requires infinitely many mirror points unless $\\theta/\\pi$ is rational is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Statement B:** For a strip $D = \\{(x_{1},x_{2}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : 0  x_{2}  L\\}$, the boundary consists of two parallel lines, $x_2=0$ and $x_2=L$. Let the source be at $y=(y_1, y_2)$. To make the potential zero on the line $x_2=0$, an image of opposite charge is placed at $(y_1, -y_2)$. To make it zero on $x_2=L$, another image is placed at $(y_1, 2L-y_2)$. However, the potential from the first image does not vanish on the line $x_2=L$, and vice versa. This requires further reflections of the images themselves. Reflecting the image at $(y_1, -y_2)$ across $x_2=L$ gives a new image at $(y_1, y_2+2L)$, and so on. This process never terminates and generates a countably infinite, periodic array of images along the $x_2$-axis. The locations are $(y_1, y_2 + 2kL)$ and $(y_1, -y_2 + 2kL)$ for all integers $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Statement C:** For a smooth, strictly convex bounded domain $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with non-zero curvature everywhere (an ellipse is a canonical example), the boundary is not composed of line segments or circular arcs. If the Green's function $G(x,y)$ could be constructed from a finite number of images, it would be an algebraic function of $x$ (for $n=2$, it involves logarithms, so it is a sum of multi-valued functions whose level sets are algebraic). The Schwarz reflection principle allows for the analytic continuation of a harmonic function across an analytic boundary. When applied to the Green's function, the location and nature of the singularities of the continued function are determined by the geometry of the boundary. For a general analytic curve, the reflection of a point source is not another point source but a more complicated singularity structure (a branch cut), which corresponds to a continuous distribution of image sources. A finite number of images only works for domains bounded by straight lines and circles, for which the reflection (inversion for circles) maps point sources to point sources. Therefore, for a general smooth convex domain, a finite MoI construction fails.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Statement D:** The method of images works for a ball $B_{R}(0) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for any dimension $n \\geq 2$. For a source at $y \\in B_R(0)$, the Green's function is constructed using exactly one image point $y'$, which is the inversion of $y$ in the sphere $\\partial B_R(0)$, i.e., $y' = \\frac{R^2}{|y|^2}y$. The strength of the image charge is $q = (\\frac{R}{|y|})^{n-2}$. The resulting function $G(x,y) = \\Phi(x,y) - q \\Phi(x,y')$ (where $\\Phi$ is the fundamental solution) satisfies the Dirichlet boundary condition $G=0$ on $|x|=R$. This is a classic, successful application of the MoI. The statement that the method fails is false. The given reason, \"inversion does not preserve harmonicity,\" is also incorrect. The Kelvin transform, which is based on inversion, preserves harmonicity up to a scaling factor, and this is precisely the property that makes the construction work. The function $\\Phi(x,y')$ is harmonic in $B_R(0)$ since its singularity $y'$ is outside the ball.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**Statement E:** For the Laplace–Beltrami operator $\\Delta_{g}$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, the method of images in its simplest form requires a symmetry of the space. To reflect a source from $M$ to an \"outside\" region, one needs to construct a \"double\" of the manifold, $\\tilde{M} = M \\cup \\mathcal{R}(M)$, across the boundary $\\partial M$. For the physics to be consistent, this doubling map $\\mathcal{R}$ must be an isometry, meaning it preserves the metric $g$. Then, for a source at $y\\in M$, one can place an image at $\\mathcal{R}(y)$. Since $\\mathcal{R}$ is an isometry fixing $\\partial M$, the geodesic distance from any point $x \\in \\partial M$ to $y$ is the same as the distance to $\\mathcal{R}(y)$. If the fundamental solution depends only on the geodesic distance, the potentials cancel on the boundary. The existence of such a reflectional isometry implies that $\\partial M$ is a totally geodesic submanifold. If the geometry does not admit such an isometric \"doubling,\" the method of images generally fails because there is no canonical way to define the image location and ensure the boundary condition is met.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**Statement F:** For a rectangle $D = (0,a) \\times (0,b) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$, the boundary consists of four line segments. To satisfy the Dirichlet condition on all four sides simultaneously, one must reflect the source across all four lines, then reflect the resulting images, and so on. This process generates an infinite, doubly periodic lattice of image charges that tiles the entire plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The group of isometries generated by reflections in the boundary lines is an infinite crystallographic group. A finite number of images is insufficient to make the potential zero on the entire rectangular boundary. The Green's function for a rectangle is typically expressed as an infinite series (e.g., a Fourier series), which is the result of summing over this infinite lattice of images.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "3029135"}]}
