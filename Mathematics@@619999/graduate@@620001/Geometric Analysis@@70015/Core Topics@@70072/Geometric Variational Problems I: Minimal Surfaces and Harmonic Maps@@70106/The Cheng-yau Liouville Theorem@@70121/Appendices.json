We are given that $u$ is of class $C^2$ and satisfies $\\Delta u = 0$. We define the function $f = \\log u$. To derive the properties of $f$, we compute its gradient and Laplacian.

We are given that the cutoff function $\\eta$ is identically $1$ on $B_r(0)$, which implies its gradient $\\nabla\\eta$ is zero on $B_r(0)$. Also, $\\eta$ has compact support in $B_{2r}(0)$, so $\\nabla\\eta$ is also zero outside $B_{2r}(0)$. Therefore, the integral is non-zero only over the annulus $A = B_{2r}(0) \\setminus B_r(0)$:\n$$\n\\int_{B_{2r}(0)} \\lvert\\nabla \\eta\\rvert^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{B_{2r}(0) \\setminus B_r(0)} \\lvert\\nabla \\eta\\rvert^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x.\n$$\nWe are given the bound $\\lvert\\nabla \\eta\\rvert \\le \\frac{2}{r}$.

The context is self-contained for the purpose of evaluating the given options. There are no contradictions in the setup.\n-   **Other Criteria:** The problem is not trivial, unrealistic, ill-posed, or unverifiable. It tests fundamental concepts and techniques in the analysis of PDEs.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A full solution and evaluation of the options will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to investigate the scaling of the maximum of $\\lvert\\nabla \\log u\\rvert$ on a ball of radius $r$. The Liouville theorem for harmonic functions states that any positive harmonic function on all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ must be constant. The gradient estimates explore what happens on bounded domains, particularly how the gradient can behave near a boundary or how it scales locally. The sharp rate $r^{-1}$ means that there is a universal constant $C$ such that $\\sup_{B_r(x_0)} \\lvert \\nabla \\log u \\rvert \\le C/r$ for any positive harmonic function $u$ on a larger ball (e.g., $B_{2r}(x_0)$), and that this rate is optimal, i.e., the exponent $-1$ cannot be increased.\n\n**Option A: For fixed $c > 1$ and $r > 0$, define $u_r(x) = x_1 + c r$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $u_r$ is positive and harmonic on $B_r(0)$, and $\\sup_{B_r(0)} \\lvert \\nabla \\log u_r \\rvert = \\frac{1}{(c-1)\\,r}$, so the local rate $\\sim r^{-1}$ is attained up to a constant factor.**\n\n-   **Harmonicity**: The function is $u_r(x) = x_1 + c r$. The Laplace operator is linear. $\\Delta u_r = \\Delta(x_1) + \\Delta(cr) = 0 + 0 = 0$. So, $u_r$ is harmonic on all of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n-   **Positivity**: For any $x \\in B_r(0)$, we have $\\lvert x \\rvert  r$. This implies $-r  x_1  r$. The function value is $u_r(x) = x_1 + cr$. The infimum of $u_r$ on $B_r(0)$ is approached as $x_1$ approaches $-r$. The values are strictly greater than $-r + cr = (c-1)r$. Since $c > 1$ and $r > 0$, $(c-1)r > 0$, so $u_r$ is positive on $B_r(0)$.\n-   **Gradient Calculation**: The gradient is $\\nabla u_r = e_1$, where $e_1 = (1, 0, \\dots, 0)$.\n-   **Logarithmic Gradient**: $\\nabla \\log u_r = \\frac{\\nabla u_r}{u_r} = \\frac{e_1}{x_1 + cr}$.\n-   **Norm**: $\\lvert \\nabla \\log u_r \\rvert = \\left\\lvert \\frac{e_1}{x_1 + cr} \\right\\rvert = \\frac{1}{x_1 + cr}$, since $x_1+cr > 0$ on $B_r(0)$.\n-   **Supremum**: To find the supremum on $B_r(0)$, we must find the infimum of the denominator $x_1 + cr$. As $x$ ranges over $B_r(0)$, $x_1$ ranges over $(-r, r)$. The infimum of $x_1 + cr$ is $\\inf_{x_1 \\in (-r,r)} (x_1 + cr) = -r + cr = (c-1)r$.\n-   Therefore, $\\sup_{x \\in B_r(0)} \\lvert \\nabla \\log u_r \\rvert = \\frac{1}{(c-1)r}$.\n-   This result scales exactly as $r^{-1}$. The constant factor is $1/(c-1)$. The statement is entirely correct. This example shows that the $r^{-1}$ rate is achieved.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B: For $n \\ge 3$, the fundamental solution $u(x) = \\lvert x \\rvert^{2-n}$ is positive and harmonic on $B_r(0)$ and satisfies $\\sup_{B_r(0)} \\lvert \\nabla \\log u \\rvert \\lesssim 1$ independent of $r$, which shows the local rate can be improved below $r^{-1}$.**\n\n-   The premise that $u(x) = \\lvert x \\rvert^{2-n}$ is \"positive and harmonic on $B_r(0)$\" is false. The function is undefined at $x=0$ and is not continuous there, let alone $C^2$. Therefore, it cannot be harmonic on any domain containing the origin. The function is harmonic on $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n-   Even if we were to consider the domain $B_r(0) \\setminus \\{0\\}$, let's compute the logarithmic gradient.\n    -   $\\nabla u = (2-n) \\lvert x \\rvert^{1-n} \\frac{x}{\\lvert x \\rvert} = (2-n) \\lvert x \\rvert^{-n} x$.\n    -   $\\nabla \\log u = \\frac{\\nabla u}{u} = \\frac{(2-n) \\lvert x \\rvert^{-n} x}{\\lvert x \\rvert^{2-n}} = (2-n) \\lvert x \\rvert^{-2} x$.\n    -   $\\lvert \\nabla \\log u \\rvert = \\lvert 2-n \\rvert \\lvert x \\rvert^{-2} \\lvert x \\rvert = (n-2) \\lvert x \\rvert^{-1}$.\n-   The supremum of this quantity on $B_r(0) \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is $\\sup_{0  \\lvert x \\rvert  r} (n-2) \\lvert x \\rvert^{-1}$, which is infinite as $\\lvert x \\rvert \\to 0$.\n-   The statement is flawed in its premise (harmonicity on $B_r(0)$) and its conclusion ($\\lesssim 1$). If the ball were taken not to contain the origin, say $B_r(x_0)$ with $\\lvert x_0 \\rvert > r$, the quantity would be bounded, but the scaling argument would again point to an $r^{-1}$ rate if the ball annhilates a singularity on its boundary.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C: Suppose a universal local gradient bound of the form $\\sup_{B_r(x_0)} \\lvert \\nabla \\log u \\rvert \\leq C\\, r^{-\\beta}$ were to hold for all positive harmonic $u$ on $B_{2r}(x_0)$, with some exponent $\\beta  1$. By scaling $v(y) = u(x_0 + r y)$, using that $\\Delta v = 0$ on $B_2(0)$ and the relation $\\nabla_y \\log v(y) = r \\,\\nabla_x \\log u(x_0 + r y)$, one obtains a contradiction as $r \\to 0$. Therefore no universal bound with $\\beta  1$ can generally hold.**\n\n-   This option outlines a standard scaling argument used in PDE theory to establish the sharpness of an estimate.\n-   **The Argument**: Let's formalize the reasoning. Assume for contradiction that such a bound holds for all positive harmonic functions $u$ on $B_{2r}(x_0)$ with a universal constant $C$ and an exponent $\\beta  1$.\n-   Let's choose a specific, non-constant, positive harmonic function on a fixed domain. For example, let $u_0(y) = y_1+2$. This function is positive and harmonic on $B_2(0)$. Since it's not constant, $K := \\sup_{y \\in B_1(0)} \\lvert \\nabla_y \\log u_0(y) \\rvert > 0$. In fact, $K = \\sup_{y \\in B_1(0)} \\frac{1}{y_1+2} = 1$.\n-   Now, for any $r > 0$ and any $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, define a new function $u_r(x) = u_0(\\frac{x-x_0}{r})$.\n    -   If $x \\in B_{2r}(x_0)$, then $\\frac{x-x_0}{r} \\in B_2(0)$, so $u_r$ is well-defined.\n    -   $u_r$ is positive since $u_0$ is.\n    -   $u_r$ is harmonic: $\\Delta_x u_r(x) = \\Delta_x u_0(\\frac{x-x_0}{r})$. Using chain rule, $\\Delta_x = (1/r^2)\\Delta_y$, so $\\Delta_x u_r(x) = (1/r^2)(\\Delta_y u_0)(\\frac{x-x_0}{r}) = 0$.\n-   Now we apply the hypothetical bound to our constructed function $u_r$ on the ball $B_r(x_0)$: $\\sup_{x \\in B_r(x_0)} \\lvert \\nabla_x \\log u_r(x) \\rvert \\leq C r^{-\\beta}$.\n-   Let's compute the left-hand side. Let $y = \\frac{x-x_0}{r}$. Then $\\nabla_x = \\frac{1}{r}\\nabla_y$.\n    -   $\\nabla_x \\log u_r(x) = \\nabla_x \\log u_0(y) = \\frac{1}{r} \\nabla_y \\log u_0(y)$.\n-   Taking the supremum over $x \\in B_r(x_0)$ is equivalent to taking the supremum over $y \\in B_1(0)$.\n    -   $\\sup_{x \\in B_r(x_0)} \\lvert \\nabla_x \\log u_r(x) \\rvert = \\sup_{y \\in B_1(0)} \\left\\lvert \\frac{1}{r} \\nabla_y \\log u_0(y) \\right\\rvert = \\frac{1}{r} \\sup_{y \\in B_1(0)} \\lvert \\nabla_y \\log u_0(y) \\rvert = \\frac{K}{r}$.\n-   The inequality becomes $\\frac{K}{r} \\leq C r^{-\\beta}$, which simplifies to $K \\leq C r^{1-\\beta}$.\n-   This inequality must hold for all $r > 0$. However, since we assumed $\\beta  1$, the exponent $1-\\beta$ is positive. As we let $r \\to 0$, the right side $C r^{1-\\beta} \\to 0$.\n-   This implies $K \\leq 0$. But we chose $u_0$ to be non-constant, so $K > 0$. This is a contradiction.\n-   The logical structure of the argument presented in option C is sound and correctly demonstrates that the $r^{-1}$ rate cannot be improved to $r^{-\\beta}$ for $\\beta  1$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option D: The function $u(x) = e^{x_1}$ is positive and harmonic on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with $\\sup_{B_r(x_0)} \\lvert \\nabla \\log u \\rvert = 1$ for every $r > 0$, which shows the best possible rate is independent of $r$.**\n\n-   **Harmonicity**: Let's check if $u(x) = e^{x_1}$ is harmonic.\n    -   $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_1} = e^{x_1}$.\n    -   $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_1^2} = e^{x_1}$.\n    -   For $i > 1$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_i^2} = 0$.\n    -   $\\Delta u = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_i^2} = e^{x_1}$.\n-   Since $\\Delta u = e^{x_1} \\neq 0$, the function $u(x) = e^{x_1}$ is not harmonic. The fundamental premise of the statement is false.\n-   Therefore, this example is not relevant to the behavior of harmonic functions. The calculation $\\lvert \\nabla \\log u \\rvert = \\lvert \\nabla x_1 \\rvert = \\lvert e_1 \\rvert = 1$ is correct for the given function, but since the function is not harmonic, no valid conclusion about harmonic functions can be drawn.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E: Fix $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ and consider the Poisson kernel for the unit ball... $P(x,\\theta) = c_n \\frac{1 - \\lvert x \\rvert^2}{\\lvert x - \\theta \\rvert^n}$... For points $x$ with $\\operatorname{dist}(x, \\partial B_1(0)) \\sim r$ and balls $B_r(x) \\subset B_1(0)$ tangent to $\\partial B_1(0)$ at $\\theta$, the function $P(\\cdot,\\theta)$ is positive and harmonic on $B_r(x)$ and satisfies $\\sup_{B_r(x)} \\lvert \\nabla \\log P(\\cdot,\\theta) \\rvert \\sim r^{-1}$, demonstrating the sharp local rate near the boundary.**\n\n-   **Properties of Poisson Kernel**: It is a standard result that for any fixed $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, the function $x \\mapsto P(x,\\theta)$ is positive and harmonic on the open unit ball $B_1(0)$.\n-   **Local Analysis**: The statement suggests analyzing the function in a small ball $B_r(x_0)$ which is interior to $B_1(0)$ but close to the boundary $\\partial B_1(0)$. A ball \"tangent to $\\partial B_1(0)$ at $\\theta$\" with radius $r$ must have its center at $x_0 = (1-r)\\theta$. This ball is $B_r((1-r)\\theta)$. Points in this ball are of the form $x = (1-r)\\theta + z$ where $\\lvert z \\rvert  r$.\n-   **Gradient Computation**: A known formula for the logarithmic gradient of the Poisson kernel is:\n    $$ \\nabla_x \\log P(x,\\theta) = \\frac{-2x}{1 - \\lvert x \\rvert^2} - n \\frac{x-\\theta}{\\lvert x-\\theta \\rvert^2} $$\n-   **Scaling Analysis**: Let's analyze the magnitude of this expression in the ball $B_r((1-r)\\theta)$. Let $x$ be a point in this ball.\n    -   The distance from $x$ to the boundary is $\\operatorname{dist}(x, \\partial B_1(0)) = 1-\\lvert x \\rvert$. Since $x$ is near $(1-r)\\theta$, $1-\\lvert x \\rvert$ is of order $r$. So, $1-\\lvert x \\rvert^2 = (1-\\lvert x \\rvert)(1+\\lvert x \\rvert) \\sim r$. The first term $\\frac{-2x}{1 - \\lvert x \\rvert^2}$ has magnitude of order $r^{-1}$.\n    -   The distance from $x$ to the pole $\\theta$ is $\\lvert x-\\theta \\rvert$. For $x = (1-r)\\theta+z$ with $\\lvert z \\rvert  r$, we have $x-\\theta = -r\\theta + z$. The magnitude $\\lvert x-\\theta \\rvert = \\lvert z - r\\theta \\rvert$ is bounded by $\\lvert z \\rvert + r\\lvert\\theta\\rvert  2r$ and bounded below by $0$. For most points in the ball, this distance is of order $r$. Thus, the second term $-n \\frac{x-\\theta}{\\lvert x-\\theta \\rvert^2}$ has magnitude of order $r/r^2 = r^{-1}$.\n-   Let's check the center $x_0 = (1-r)\\theta$:\n    -   $1 - \\lvert x_0 \\rvert^2 = 1-(1-r)^2 = 2r-r^2$.\n    -   $x_0-\\theta = -r\\theta$. $\\lvert x_0-\\theta \\rvert^2 = r^2$.\n    -   $\\nabla \\log P(x_0, \\theta) = \\frac{-2(1-r)\\theta}{2r-r^2} - n \\frac{-r\\theta}{r^2} = \\left( -\\frac{2(1-r)}{r(2-r)} + \\frac{n}{r} \\right) \\theta$.\n    -   For small $r$, the magnitude is $\\approx \\frac{1}{r} \\lvert -1+n \\rvert = \\frac{n-1}{r}$.\n-   The gradient at the center of the ball $B_r(x_0)$ already scales as $r^{-1}$. The supremum over the ball will have the same scaling. This example correctly shows that the $r^{-1}$ local rate is achieved by a canonical positive harmonic function near the boundary of its domain.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n### Summary of Correct Statements\n-   Statement **A** provides a valid elementary construction achieving the $r^{-1}$ rate.\n-   Statement **C** provides a valid scaling argument proving the $r^{-1}$ rate is sharp (cannot be improved).\n-   Statement **E** provides a valid, canonical example (the Poisson kernel) that demonstrates the $r^{-1}$ rate near the boundary of a domain.\n\nAll three statements are correct and address the prompt's question from different, valid angles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3034467"}]}
