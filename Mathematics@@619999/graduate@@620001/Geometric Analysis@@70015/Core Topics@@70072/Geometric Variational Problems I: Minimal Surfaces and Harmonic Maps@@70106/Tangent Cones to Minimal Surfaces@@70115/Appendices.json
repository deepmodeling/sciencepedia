A surface with zero mean curvature everywhere is, by definition, a minimal surface. This verifies the minimality of the helicoid.\n\nThe mean curvature vector $\\vec{H}$ is defined as $\\vec{H} = H\\vec{n}$. Since $H=0$, the mean curvature vector is:\n$$\n\\vec{H} = 0 \\cdot \\vec{n} = \\vec{0} = (0, 0, 0)\n$$\n\nNext, we justify from first principles why the tangent cone of the associated rectifiable set coincides with the tangent plane at any smooth point.\nThe surface $S = X(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$ is a smooth ($C^\\infty$) immersed submanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$. As such, it is a rectifiable set. Let $p_0 \\in S$ be an arbitrary point, corresponding to parameters $(u_0, v_0)$, so $p_0 = X(u_0, v_0)$. Since $X$ is smooth, $p_0$ is a smooth point.\n\nThe tangent cone to a set $K$ at a point $p$ is defined via a blow-up procedure. It is the limit of the rescaled sets $K_{p,r} = \\frac{1}{r}(K-p)$ as the scaling factor $r \\to 0$.\nThe surface $S$ near $p_0$ can be approximated by its Taylor expansion. For a point $q=(u,v)$ near $q_0=(u_0,v_0)$, we have:\n$$\nX(q) = X(q_0) + dX_{q_0}(q-q_0) + R(q-q_0)\n$$\nHere, $p_0=X(q_0)$, $dX_{q_0}$ is the differential of $X$ at $q_0$, and $R(h)$ is the remainder term, which satisfies $\\lim_{\\|h\\| \\to 0} \\frac{\\|R(h)\\|}{\\|h\\|} = 0$. The image of the linear map $dX_{q_0}$ is the tangent plane $T_{p_0}S$.\n\nTo find the tangent cone, we consider the limit of the blow-up set $\\frac{1}{r}(S - p_0)$. A point in this set is of the form $\\frac{1}{r}(X(q) - p_0)$ where $q$ approaches $q_0$. We can relate the approach in the parameter domain to the scaling factor $r$ by setting $q - q_0 = r\\vec{w}$ for some vector $\\vec{w}$ in the parameter space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. As $r \\to 0$, $q \\to q_0$. Substituting this into the blow-up expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r}(X(q_0 + r\\vec{w}) - X(q_0)) = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( dX_{q_0}(r\\vec{w}) + R(r\\vec{w}) \\right)\n$$\nBy linearity of the differential, $dX_{q_0}(r\\vec{w}) = r \\cdot dX_{q_0}(\\vec{w})$. So the expression becomes:\n$$\ndX_{q_0}(\\vec{w}) + \\frac{R(r\\vec{w})}{r}\n$$\nAs $r \\to 0$, the limit of the remainder term is:\n$$\n\\lim_{r \\to 0} \\left\\| \\frac{R(r\\vec{w})}{r} \\right\\| = \\|\\vec{w}\\| \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{\\|R(r\\vec{w})\\|}{\\|r\\vec{w}\\|} = \\|\\vec{w}\\| \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThus, as $r \\to 0$, the blow-up sets converge to the set $\\{ dX_{q_0}(\\vec{w}) \\mid \\vec{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\}$. This set is the image of the differential map $dX_{q_0}$, which is precisely the tangent plane $T_{p_0}S$.\nSince this limit is independent of the sequence of radii approaching zero, the tangent cone is unique and coincides with the tangent plane.\nThis holds for any smooth point on any smooth surface. As the given helicoid is smooth everywhere, this conclusion applies to all of its points, including the one at $(u,v) = (0,0)$. At this point, $p_0 = X(0,0) = (0,0,0)$, and the tangent plane is spanned by $X_u(0,0)=(1,0,0)$ and $X_v(0,0)=(0,0,\\alpha)$, which is the $xz$-plane.

This corresponds to the eigenfunction $\\varphi(\\theta) \\equiv 1$. For a constant function, the Laplacian is zero, so $\\Delta_{\\Sigma}\\varphi = 0$, which implies the eigenvalue is $\\lambda=0$. We are also given that the squared norm of the second fundamental form of $\\Sigma$ is $|A_{\\Sigma}|^{2} = m-1$.\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda=0$ and $|A_{\\Sigma}|^{2} = m-1$ into the indicial equation yields a quadratic equation for $\\beta$ depending only on $m$:\n$$\n\\beta^{2} + (m-2)\\beta + (m-1) = 0.\n$$\nWe solve for the roots $\\beta_{\\pm}(m)$ using the quadratic formula, $\\beta = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\n\\beta_{\\pm}(m) = \\frac{-(m-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(m-2)^{2} - 4(1)(m-1)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_{\\pm}(m) = \\frac{-(m-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(m^{2}-4m+4) - (4m-4)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta_{\\pm}(m) = \\frac{-(m-2) \\pm \\sqrt{m^{2}-8m+8}}{2}.\n$$\nThese are the two indicial roots for the constant mode. The near-vertex behavior ($r \\to 0$) of the separated solutions $u(r) = r^{\\beta}$ is determined by the nature of these roots. The discriminant is $D = m^{2}-8m+8$.\n\n*   If $D < 0$, the roots are complex conjugates. This occurs for $m \\in (4-2\\sqrt{2}, 4+2\\sqrt{2})$, which for integer $m \\geq 3$ corresponds to $m \\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. In this case, the solutions are of the form $r^{\\alpha}(\\cos(\\gamma\\ln r), \\sin(\\gamma\\ln r))$, where $\\alpha = -(m-2)/2$ and $\\gamma=\\sqrt{-D}/2$. These solutions oscillate infinitely often as $r \\to 0$, a signature of instability for the cone.\n*   If $D \\geq 0$, the roots are real. This occurs for $m \\geq 7$ (since $m$ is an integer and $4+2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 6.83$). The two real roots lead to solutions $r^{\\beta_{+}}$ and $r^{\\beta_{-}}$. Since $\\sqrt{m^2-8m+8} < \\sqrt{(m-2)^2} = m-2$ for $m>1$, both roots are negative. These solutions grow as $r \\to 0$, which is characteristic of stable minimal cones.\n\nThe smaller of the two roots is $\\beta_{-}(m)$, corresponding to the minus sign in the formula.\n\n**3) Stability Criterion**\n\nThe stability of the cone is determined by the sign of the second variation of area for any smooth compactly supported normal variation $u$:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}\\mathcal{A}(u) = \\int_{C} \\left( |\\nabla_{C} u|^{2} - |A_{C}|^{2} u^{2} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu_{C}.\n$$\nThe cone is stable if $\\delta^{2}\\mathcal{A}(u) \\geq 0$ for all such $u$, and unstable if there exists a $u$ for which $\\delta^{2}\\mathcal{A}(u) < 0$.\n\nWe decompose the variation $u$ in the basis of eigenfunctions $\\{\\varphi_k\\}$ of $\\Delta_{\\Sigma}$: $u(r, \\theta) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} v_k(r) \\varphi_k(\\theta)$, where $\\Delta_\\Sigma \\varphi_k = -\\lambda_k \\varphi_k$. We assume the eigenfunctions are orthonormal on $L^2(\\Sigma)$. Substituting this expansion into the integral for $\\delta^{2}\\mathcal{A}(u)$ and using the orthogonality of $\\varphi_k$, we can separate the contributions from each mode:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}\\mathcal{A}(u) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left( r^{m-1} |\\partial_{r}v_k|^{2} + (\\lambda_k - |A_{\\Sigma}|^{2}) r^{m-3} |v_k|^{2} \\right) \\mathrm{d}r.\n$$\nThe cone is unstable if any term in this sum can be made negative. Let's focus on a single mode $k$. The corresponding term is:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}\\mathcal{A}_k = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{m-1} |\\partial_{r}v_k|^{2} \\mathrm{d}r - (|A_{\\Sigma}|^{2} - \\lambda_k) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{m-3} |v_k|^{2} \\mathrm{d}r.\n$$\nWe are given the one-dimensional Hardy inequality on $(0,\\infty)$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{m-1}\\,|\\partial_{r} v|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}r \\geq \\frac{(m-2)^{2}}{4}\\,\\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{m-3}\\,|v|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}r.\n$$\nApplying this to our expression for $\\delta^{2}\\mathcal{A}_k$:\n$$\n\\delta^{2}\\mathcal{A}_k \\geq \\left( \\frac{(m-2)^{2}}{4} - (|A_{\\Sigma}|^{2} - \\lambda_k) \\right) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r^{m-3} |v_k|^{2} \\mathrm{d}r.\n$$\nThe cone is stable if the prefactor is non-negative for all eigenvalues $\\lambda_k$, i.e., $\\frac{(m-2)^2}{4} \\geq |A_{\\Sigma}|^2 - \\lambda_k$. The cone is unstable if there exists at least one $k$ for which this inequality is reversed. The most stringent condition comes from the smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_0 = 0$, which corresponds to the constant mode $\\varphi_0 = 1$.\n\nFor instability, we require:\n$$\n\\frac{(m-2)^{2}}{4} < |A_{\\Sigma}|^{2} - \\lambda_0.\n$$\nSubstituting $|A_{\\Sigma}|^{2} = m-1$ and $\\lambda_0 = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{(m-2)^{2}}{4} < m-1\n$$\n$$\n(m-2)^{2} < 4(m-1)\n$$\n$$\nm^{2} - 4m + 4 < 4m - 4\n$$\n$$\nm^{2} - 8m + 8 < 0.\n$$\nThe roots of the quadratic $m^{2} - 8m + 8 = 0$ are $m = 4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since the parabola opens upward, the inequality holds for $m$ between these roots: $4-2\\sqrt{2} < m < 4+2\\sqrt{2}$.\nNumerically, this is approximately $1.17 < m < 6.83$. Since $m \\geq 3$ is an integer, the cone is unstable for $m \\in \\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. It is stable for $m \\geq 7$. This well-known result from the theory of minimal submanifolds (the Simons' cones) confirms the correctness of our analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for the smaller indicial root $\\beta_{-}(m)$ for the constant angular mode ($\\lambda=0$). From Part 2, this is:\n$$\n\\beta_{-}(m) = \\frac{-(m-2) - \\sqrt{m^{2}-8m+8}}{2} = \\frac{2-m - \\sqrt{m^{2}-8m+8}}{2}.\n$$\nThis is the required final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2-m - \\sqrt{m^{2} - 8m + 8}}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3033979"}]}
