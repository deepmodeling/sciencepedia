No rounding is required, and no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The user wants to find a specific spectral value of the stability operator for a totally geodesic equator in a sphere and determine the stability of this equator.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Stability Operator $S$\n\nThe general stability (or Jacobi) operator $S$ for a minimal hypersurface $\\Sigma^k \\subset M^{k+1}$ acts on smooth functions $f$ on $\\Sigma$ (representing the normal speed of a variation) and is given by the formula:\n$$\nS(f) = -\\Delta_{\\Sigma}f - (|A|^2 + \\operatorname{Ric}_M(\\nu, \\nu))f\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta_{\\Sigma}$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $\\Sigma$, $A$ is the second fundamental form of the immersion, $|A|^2$ is the squared norm of the second fundamental form, $\\operatorname{Ric}_M$ is the Ricci curvature tensor of the ambient manifold $M$, and $\\nu$ is a unit normal vector field to $\\Sigma$. A surface is stable if and only if the lowest eigenvalue of $S$ is non-negative.\n\nWe apply this formula to the specific case given:\n1.  The hypersurface is $\\Sigma = S^{n-1}$ embedded as a totally geodesic equator in the ambient manifold $M = S^n$. The problem states that $\\Sigma$ is **totally geodesic**. By definition, this means its second fundamental form is identically zero, i.e., $A=0$. Consequently, its squared norm is $|A|^2 = 0$.\n\n2.  The ambient manifold is the unit $n$-sphere $S^n$. A space of constant sectional curvature $K$ has a Ricci curvature tensor given by $\\operatorname{Ric}_M = (n-1)K g_M$, where $g_M$ is the metric tensor of $M$. For the unit sphere $S^n$, the sectional curvature is $K=1$. Thus, the Ricci curvature is $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^n} = (n-1)g_{S^n}$. For any unit tangent vector $X$ at a point $p \\in S^n$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^n}(X,X) = n-1$. Since $\\nu$ is the unit normal vector to $\\Sigma$, it is a unit tangent vector to $S^n$, and therefore $\\operatorname{Ric}_{S^n}(\\nu, \\nu) = n-1$.\n\nSubstituting these components into the general formula for $S$, we obtain the explicit form of the operator for the equator $\\Sigma = S^{n-1}$:\n$$\nS(f) = -\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}f - (0 + (n-1))f\n$$\n$$\nS(f) = -\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}f - (n-1)f\n$$\nThus, the operator is $S = -\\Delta_{S^{n-1}} - (n-1)I$, where $I$ is the identity operator.\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of the Spectral Value\n\nTo find the spectral values of $S$, we must first know the spectral properties of the negative Laplace-Beltrami operator, $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$, on the standard unit $(n-1)$-sphere. This operator is non-negative and its eigenvalues are given by:\n$$\n\\lambda_k = k(k+n-2) \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nIf $\\phi_k$ is an eigenfunction of $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$, then by definition, $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}\\phi_k = \\lambda_k \\phi_k$.\n\nWe can now find the eigenvalues of $S$ by applying it to the eigenfunctions $\\phi_k$:\n$$\nS(\\phi_k) = -\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}\\phi_k - (n-1)\\phi_k = \\lambda_k\\phi_k - (n-1)\\phi_k = (\\lambda_k - (n-1))\\phi_k\n$$\nThis shows that the eigenvalues of $S$, which we denote by $\\mu_k$, are related to the eigenvalues of $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$ by:\n$$\n\\mu_k = \\lambda_k - (n-1) = k(k+n-2) - (n-1)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the spectral value of $S$ for eigenfunctions \"arising from the lowest eigenvalue of the negative Laplace–Beltrami operator on $\\Sigma$\". This is the eigenvalue corresponding to $k=0$.\n\nThe lowest eigenvalue of $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$ is $\\lambda_0 = 0(0+n-2) = 0$. The eigenfunctions for $k=0$ are the constant functions on $S^{n-1}$.\n\nFor these constant eigenfunctions, the corresponding spectral value of $S$ is $\\mu_0$:\n$$\n\\mu_0 = \\lambda_0 - (n-1) = 0 - (n-1) = -(n-1)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the \"smallest spectral value of $S$ among\" this class of eigenfunctions. Since the eigenspace for $\\lambda_0=0$ corresponds to a single eigenvalue $\\mu_0=-(n-1)$ for the operator $S$, this value is trivially the smallest (and only) one.\n\n### Step 3: Stability Analysis\n\nA minimal hypersurface is defined as stable if the lowest eigenvalue of its stability operator $S$ is non-negative. The spectrum of $S$ is $\\{\\mu_k\\}_{k=0}^\\infty = \\{-(n-1), 1(1+n-2)-(n-1), \\dots\\} = \\{-(n-1), 0, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe lowest eigenvalue is $\\mu_0 = -(n-1)$. Since $n \\ge 2$ for the equator $S^{n-1}$ to be defined in $S^n$, this eigenvalue is strictly negative: $\\mu_0 < 0$. The existence of a negative eigenvalue for $S$ implies instability. The variation corresponding to the constant eigenfunction decreases area, so the totally geodesic equator $\\Sigma = S^{n-1}$ is an unstable minimal hypersurface in $S^n$.\n\nThe exact analytic expression for the specified spectral value is $-(n-1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-(n-1)}\n$$", "id": "3036675"}, {"introduction": "In Euclidean space, where the ambient curvature vanishes, stability is governed solely by the geometry of the minimal hypersurface itself, captured by the squared norm of its second fundamental form, $|A|^2$.

The eigenvalue problem is $Sf = \\eta f$. We seek solutions $f$ that are in the $L^2$ space on the catenoid with the measure $d\\mu = \\sqrt{EG-F^2}dudv = \\cosh^2(v)dudv$.\nWe use separation of variables, exploiting the rotational symmetry of the catenoid. Since the surface is periodic in the $u$ coordinate with period $2\\pi$, we can expand a function $f(u,v)$ in a Fourier series:\n$$\nf(u,v) = \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\phi_k(v) e^{iku}\n$$\nThe operator $S$ acts on each Fourier mode independently.

A more direct route is to analyze the quadratic form $Q(f)$. For each Fourier mode $f_k$, the quadratic form is:\n\\begin{align*}\nQ(f_k) &= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ |\\nabla f_k|^2 - |A|^2 |f_k|^2 \\right] d\\mu \\\\\n&= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(v)}(k^2|\\phi_k|^2 + |\\phi_k'|^2) - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^4(v)}|\\phi_k|^2 \\right] \\cosh^2(v) dv du \\\\\n&= 2\\pi \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( |\\phi_k'|^2 + k^2|\\phi_k|^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}|\\phi_k|^2 \\right) dv \\\\\n&= 2\\pi \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( |\\phi_k'|^2 + \\left(k^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}\\right)|\\phi_k|^2 \\right) dv\n\\end{align*}\nThis quadratic form is associated with the one-dimensional Schrödinger operator $S_k = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} + V_k(v)$, where the potential is $V_k(v) = k^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. The Morse index is the total number of negative eigenvalues of the operators $S_k$ for all integer values of $k$, counting multiplicities. Note that for $k \\ne 0$, the modes $e^{iku}$ and $e^{-iku}$ (or $\\cos(ku)$ and $\\sin(ku)$ in real form) are distinct, so each negative eigenvalue for $k > 0$ contributes $2$ to the index.\n\nThe potential in $S_k$ is a shifted Pöschl-Teller potential. Let's analyze the spectrum of the base operator $H = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. This corresponds to the Pöschl-Teller potential $V(v) = -s(s+1)/\\cosh^2(v)$ with $s(s+1) = 2$, which gives $s=1$ (taking $s>0$). The discrete spectrum of such an operator is given by $E_n = -(s-n)^2$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, \\lfloor s \\rfloor$. With $s=1$, the only allowed value is $n=0$, giving a single bound state with eigenvalue $E_0 = -(1-0)^2 = -1$.\n\nThe operator for the $k$-th mode is $S_k = H + k^2$. Its eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of $H$ shifted by $k^2$. The lowest eigenvalue of $S_k$ is therefore $\\epsilon_{k,0} = E_0 + k^2 = -1 + k^2$.\n\nWe need to find for which integer values of $k$ the lowest eigenvalue $\\epsilon_{k,0}$ is negative:\n$$\n-1 + k^2 < 0 \\implies k^2 < 1\n$$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the only value that satisfies this inequality is $k=0$.\n\nFor $k=0$: The operator is $S_0 = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. Its lowest eigenvalue is $\\epsilon_{0,0} = -1 + 0^2 = -1$. This is a negative eigenvalue. The mode is independent of $u$ (radially symmetric), so it corresponds to a single eigenfunction. This contributes $1$ to the Morse index.\n\nFor $|k|=1$: The operator is $S_1 = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} + 1 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. Its lowest eigenvalue is $\\epsilon_{1,0} = -1 + 1^2 = 0$. Since the lowest eigenvalue is zero and the rest of the spectrum is positive, there are no negative eigenvalues for this mode. Jacobi fields (eigenfunctions with eigenvalue $0$) do not contribute to the Morse index.\n\nFor $|k| \\ge 2$: The operator is $S_k = -\\frac{d^2}{dv^2} + k^2 - \\frac{2}{\\cosh^2(v)}$. Its lowest eigenvalue is $\\epsilon_{k,0} = -1 + k^2 \\ge -1 + 4 = 3 > 0$. There are no negative eigenvalues for these modes.\n\nSumming up the contributions from all modes, only the $k=0$ mode yields a negative eigenvalue. There is exactly one such eigenvalue.
