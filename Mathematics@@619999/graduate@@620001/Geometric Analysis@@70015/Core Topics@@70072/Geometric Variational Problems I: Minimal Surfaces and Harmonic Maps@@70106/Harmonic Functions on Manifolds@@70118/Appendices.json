We will use the Einstein summation convention, where summation is implied over repeated upper and lower indices from $1$ to $n$.\n\nFirst, the gradient vector field, $\\operatorname{grad}_{g}u$, is the vector field metrically dual to the $1$-form $du = \\partial_j u \\, dx^j$.

Derivation of the Poisson Kernel**\n\nThe hyperbolic metric on the Poincaré disk $\\mathbb{B}^2$ is given by $g = \\frac{4}{(1-|x|^2)^2}\\delta$. This metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric $\\delta$, meaning $g = \\Omega(x)^2 \\delta$ where the conformal factor is $\\Omega(x) = \\frac{2}{1-|x|^2}$.\n\nFor a $2$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with a metric $g$ that is conformal to the Euclidean metric $\\delta$, say $g = \\Omega^2 \\delta$, the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_g$ is related to the standard Euclidean Laplacian $\\Delta_\\delta$ by the formula:\n$$\n\\Delta_g u = \\Omega^{-2} \\Delta_\\delta u\n$$\nThis property is specific to dimension $n=2$. A function $u$ is called hyperbolic-harmonic if it satisfies $\\Delta_g u = 0$.

The solution to this classical problem is given by the Poisson integral formula.

As established above, this is equivalent to being hyperbolic-harmonic, $\\Delta_g u = 0$.\n\n-   **Bounded**: The Poisson kernel $P(x,\\xi)$ is non-negative for all $x \\in \\mathbb{B}^2$ and $\\xi \\in S^1$. The boundary function $f(\\xi)$ takes values in $\\{0, 1\\}$. By the maximum principle for harmonic functions, the values of $u(x)$ must lie between the infimum and supremum of the boundary data.\n$$\n\\inf_{S^1}(f) \\le u(x) \\le \\sup_{S^1}(f) \\implies 0 \\le u(x) \\le 1\n$$\nThus, $u(x)$ is bounded.\n\n-   **Nonconstant**: Since $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi)$, the set $A_{\\alpha}$ is a proper nonempty subset of $S^1$. The boundary data $f$ is not a constant function. By the strong maximum principle, a harmonic function can only attain its maximum or minimum on the boundary, unless it is constant. Since the boundary data is not constant, the solution $u(x)$ cannot be constant throughout the disk $\\mathbb{B}^2$. For instance, at the origin $x=0$, the kernel is $P(0, \\xi)=1$, so $u(0) = \\int_{A_\\alpha} 1 \\, d\\sigma(\\xi) = \\text{measure}(A_\\alpha) = \\frac{2\\alpha}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}$.

We are asked to find $\\sup_{x \\in M} |\\nabla u(x)|$ using the derived formula.\n\nLet's apply the given conditions to the Bochner formula:\n1.  Since $u$ is harmonic, $\\Delta_g u = 0$ everywhere on $M$. Consequently, the gradient of the constant function $0$ is the zero vector field, so $\\nabla(\\Delta_g u) = 0$. The third term in the formula vanishes: $\\langle \\nabla(\\Delta_g u), \\nabla u \\rangle = \\langle 0, \\nabla u \\rangle = 0$.\n2.  The Ricci curvature is non-negative, meaning $\\operatorname{Ric}(X,X) \\ge 0$ for any tangent vector $X$. In particular, for $X = \\nabla u(x)$, we have $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u(x), \\nabla u(x)) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in M$.\n3.  The term $|\\nabla^2 u|^2$ is the squared norm of the Hessian tensor, so it is non-negative, $|\\nabla^2 u|^2 \\ge 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the Bochner formula, we get a simplified inequality:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{g}|\\nabla u|^{2} = |\\nabla^{2}u|^{2} + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u, \\nabla u) \\ge 0 + 0 = 0 $$\nLet $f(x) = |\\nabla u(x)|^2$. The inequality is $\\Delta_g f \\ge 0$. A function whose Laplacian is non-negative is called a subharmonic function.\n\nThe manifold $M$ is closed, which means it is compact and has no boundary. By the weak maximum principle for elliptic operators, a subharmonic function on a compact manifold must attain its maximum on the boundary. Since $M$ has no boundary, we invoke the strong maximum principle. It states that any non-constant subharmonic function on a connected open manifold cannot attain a local maximum. As $M$ is a manifold without boundary, every point is an interior point. If we assume $M$ is connected (which is standard for such problems), the function $f = |\\nabla u|^2$ must be constant on $M$. If $f$ were not constant, it would have to attain a maximum at some point $p \\in M$, which would contradict the strong maximum principle.\n\nTherefore, $|\\nabla u|^2$ is a constant function on $M$. Let $|\\nabla u|^2 = C$ for some constant $C \\ge 0$.\nSince $|\\nabla u|^2$ is constant, its Laplacian is zero: $\\Delta_g(|\\nabla u|^2) = \\Delta_g(C) = 0$.\nPlugging this back into our simplified Bochner formula:\n$$ 0 = |\\nabla^{2}u|^{2} + \\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u, \\nabla u) $$\nThis is an equation where a sum of two non-negative terms equals zero. This is only possible if both terms are identically zero everywhere on $M$:\n1.  $|\\nabla^2 u(x)|^2 = 0$ for all $x \\in M$, which implies $\\nabla^2 u \\equiv 0$.\n2.  $\\operatorname{Ric}(\\nabla u(x), \\nabla u(x)) = 0$ for all $x \\in M$.\n\nThe condition $\\nabla^2 u = 0$ means that the $1$-form $du$ is parallel, $\\nabla(du) = 0$.\nIndependently, the definition of the gradient implies that the $1$-form $du$ is exact, as it is the exterior derivative of the $0$-form (function) $u$.\n\nSo, the $1$-form $du$ is both harmonic (since $u$ is harmonic, $\\delta(du) = \\Delta u = 0$ and $d(du)=0$) and exact on the closed manifold $M$. By a fundamental result of Hodge theory, any form that is both harmonic and exact on a closed manifold must be the zero form. We can show this using the $L^2$ inner product on forms. Let $\\omega = du$.\nThe squared $L^2$-norm of $\\omega$ is:\n$$ \\|\\omega\\|^2_{L^2} = \\int_M \\langle \\omega, \\omega \\rangle \\, dV_g = \\int_M \\langle du, \\omega \\rangle \\, dV_g $$\nUsing the property that the exterior derivative $d$ and the codifferential $\\delta$ are formal adjoints with respect to this inner product on a closed manifold, we have $\\langle d\\alpha, \\beta \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle \\alpha, \\delta\\beta \\rangle_{L^2}$. Applying this:\n$$ \\|\\omega\\|^2_{L^2} = \\langle du, \\omega \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle u, \\delta\\omega \\rangle_{L^2} $$\nSince $\\omega=du$ is harmonic, we have $\\delta \\omega = 0$. Thus:\n$$ \\|\\omega\\|^2_{L^2} = \\langle u, 0 \\rangle_{L^2} = 0 $$\nThe norm of $\\omega = du$ is zero, which implies that the form itself must be identically zero, $du=0$.\n\nIf the differential $du$ is the zero $1$-form, then its corresponding vector field, the gradient $\\nabla u$, must be the zero vector field.\n$$ \\nabla u(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in M $$\nConsequently, the norm of the gradient is zero everywhere:\n$$ |\\nabla u(x)| = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in M $$\nThe supremum of a function that is identically zero is zero.\n$$ \\sup_{x \\in M} |\\nabla u(x)| = 0 $$\nThis result is a specific case of the Bochner vanishing theorem. It implies that any harmonic function on a closed manifold with non-negative Ricci curvature must be constant.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3029659"}]}
