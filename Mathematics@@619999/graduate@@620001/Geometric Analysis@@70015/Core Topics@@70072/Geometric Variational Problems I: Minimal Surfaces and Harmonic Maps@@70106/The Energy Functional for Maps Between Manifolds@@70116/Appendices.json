This occurs at the first conjugate point along the geodesic. We will determine this by analyzing the Jacobi equation, which arises from the second variation of the energy functional.\n\nLet $(N,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold. For a smooth map $\\gamma: [0,L] \\to N$, the energy functional is given by\n$$\nE(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} g(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t)) \\, dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\|\\gamma'(t)\\|^{2} \\, dt\n$$\nThe critical points of this functional are geodesics. To study the stability of a geodesic $\\gamma$ as a minimizer, we examine the second variation of energy. Let $\\gamma : [0,L] \\to N$ be a geodesic. Consider a variation $\\gamma_s(t)$ of $\\gamma_0(t) = \\gamma(t)$ with fixed endpoints, i.e., $\\gamma_s(0) = \\gamma(0) = p$ and $\\gamma_s(L) = \\gamma(L) = q$. The variation field is $V(t) = \\frac{d}{ds}|_{s=0} \\gamma_s(t)$, which satisfies $V(0)=0$ and $V(L)=0$. The second variation of energy is given by the index form:\n$$\nE''(\\gamma)(V, V) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( \\|\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}V(t)\\|^{2} - \\langle R(\\gamma'(t), V(t))\\gamma'(t), V(t) \\rangle \\right) dt\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection and $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor on $N$. A geodesic is a stable local minimizer of energy (and length) if $E''(\\gamma)(V,V) \\ge 0$ for all such variation fields $V$. A loss of stability occurs when there exists a non-zero variation field $V$ for which $E''(\\gamma)(V,V) \\le 0$.\n\nThe null space of the second variation is characterized by Jacobi fields. A vector field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is a Jacobi field if it satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)} J(t) + R(J(t), \\gamma'(t))\\gamma'(t) = 0\n$$\nA point $q = \\gamma(L)$ is said to be conjugate to $p = \\gamma(0)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0) = 0$ and $J(L) = 0$. The existence of such a Jacobi field corresponds to a null direction for the index form, signaling a potential loss of minimality and a bifurcation in the space of geodesics.\n\nWe now specialize to the given manifold, the $2$-sphere $N = S^2_R$ of radius $R > 0$. The sectional curvature is constant, $K = 1/R^2$. For a space of constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor has a simple form: $R(X,Y)Z = K(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y)$. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a unit-speed geodesic, so $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\| = 1$. Let's set up a parallel orthonormal frame $\\{e_1(t), e_2(t)\\}$ along $\\gamma(t)$ where $e_1(t) = \\gamma'(t)$.

Since the endpoints $p$ and $q$ are distinct, the length of the geodesic $L$ is strictly positive, $L > 0$. Thus, we must have $c_1 = 0$.\nThis means that for a non-trivial Jacobi field to exist, we must have $c_3 \\neq 0$. The second equation, $c_3 \\sin(L/R) = 0$, then implies that:\n$$\n\\sin(L/R) = 0\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied if $L/R = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$. We are looking for the first conjugate point along the geodesic from $p=\\gamma(0)$, which corresponds to the smallest positive value of $L$ for which a non-trivial Jacobi field vanishing at the endpoints exists. This occurs for $n=1$, giving:\n$$\nL/R = \\pi \\implies L = \\pi R\n$$\nThe problem states that the central angle between the endpoints is $\\theta_0$, and the length of the minimizing geodesic is $L = R \\theta_0$. The critical value of the angle, $\\theta_c$, is the value of $\\theta_0$ at which the first conjugate point is reached. Equating the length for the first conjugate point with the geometric length:\n$$\nR \\theta_c = \\pi R\n$$\nSolving for $\\theta_c$ yields:\n$$\n\\theta_c = \\pi\n$$\nThis result is geometrically intuitive: the first conjugate point to a point $p$ on a sphere is its antipode.

If $k > 0$, we must have $J(u) \\ge 0$, meaning the map is orientation-preserving. If $k < 0$, we must have $J(u) \\le 0$, meaning the map is orientation-reversing. If $k=0$, the bound is $0$, which is trivially achieved by any constant map ($du=0$).\n\nThus, the energy bound $E(u) = 4\\pi|k|$ is achieved if and only if $u$ is a conformal map that is orientation-preserving (for $k>0$) or orientation-reversing (for $k<0$).\n\nThis result connects directly to the theory of harmonic maps. A harmonic map is a critical point of the energy functional $E(u)$. The Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional is $\\tau(u) = 0$, where $\\tau(u)$ is the tension field of the map. Any map that minimizes energy within its homotopy class must necessarily be a harmonic map. Our derivation shows that $4\\pi|k|$ is the infimum of the energy for all maps of degree $k$. If there exists a map $u_k$ of degree $k$ such that $E(u_k) = 4\\pi|k|$, then this map must be an energy-minimizing map in its homotopy class, and therefore must be harmonic.\n\nFor maps from the sphere $S^2$ to itself (or more generally from any Riemann surface to a KÃ¤hler manifold), it is a fundamental result that conformal maps are harmonic.\nIdentifying $S^2$ with the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{C} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$, the conditions for equality are met by specific classes of maps:\n- For $k > 0$, any rational function $f(z) = P(z)/Q(z)$ of degree $k$ is a holomorphic map from $\\mathbb{C} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ to itself. Holomorphic maps are conformal and orientation-preserving. The topological degree of such a map is precisely $k$.\n- For $k < 0$, the complex conjugate of a rational function of degree $|k|$, for example $\\overline{f(z)}$, is an anti-holomorphic map. These maps are conformal and orientation-reversing, and they have topological degree $k$.\n- For $k=0$, a constant map is harmonic and has energy $0$.\n\nSince these maps (rational functions and their conjugates) exist for every integer degree $k$ and satisfy the conditions for equality, they are the energy-minimizing harmonic representatives in their respective homotopy classes. They achieve the sharp lower bound for the energy. The energy they achieve is therefore exactly $4\\pi|k|$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi|k|}\n$$", "id": "3035476"}]}
