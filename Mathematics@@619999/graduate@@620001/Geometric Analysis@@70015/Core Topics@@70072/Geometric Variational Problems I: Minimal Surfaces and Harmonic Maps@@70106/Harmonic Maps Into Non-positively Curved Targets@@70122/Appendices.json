A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Task 1: Existence and Uniqueness of the Barycenter\n\nThe space $(T,d)$ is a complete metric tree, which is a canonical example of a complete $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space. The function to be minimized is $F(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}\\, d^{2}(x,p_{i})$.\n\nA key property of a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space is that for any two points $x_{0}, x_{1} \\in T$, the squared distance to any third point $p \\in T$ is a convex function along the unique geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ connecting $x_{0}$ and $x_{1}$. Specifically, the following inequality holds for all $t \\in [0,1]$:\n$$\nd^{2}(\\gamma(t), p) \\le (1-t)d^{2}(x_{0}, p) + t d^{2}(x_{1}, p) - t(1-t)d^{2}(x_{0}, x_{1})\n$$\nThe function $F(x)$ is a linear combination of such squared-distance functions with positive weights $w_{i} > 0$. Let's analyze the convexity of $F(x)$ along the geodesic $\\gamma(t)$:\n$$\nF(\\gamma(t)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} d^{2}(\\gamma(t), p_{i})\n$$\nApplying the $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ inequality for each term and summing them up, we get:\n$$\nF(\\gamma(t)) \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\left[ (1-t)d^{2}(x_{0}, p_{i}) + t d^{2}(x_{1}, p_{i}) - t(1-t)d^{2}(x_{0}, x_{1}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nF(\\gamma(t)) \\le (1-t) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} d^{2}(x_{0}, p_{i}) + t \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} d^{2}(x_{1}, p_{i}) - t(1-t)d^{2}(x_{0}, x_{1}) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}\n$$\n$$\nF(\\gamma(t)) \\le (1-t)F(x_{0}) + tF(x_{1}) - t(1-t) W d^{2}(x_{0}, x_{1})\n$$\nwhere $W = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}$ is the total weight. Since all $w_i > 0$, we have $W > 0$. For any two distinct points $x_{0} \\neq x_{1}$, $d^{2}(x_{0}, x_{1}) > 0$. Thus, for $t \\in (0,1)$, the function $F(x)$ is strictly convex.\n\nA fundamental theorem in the analysis on metric spaces states that a continuous and strictly convex function on a complete metric space admits at most one minimizer. The existence of a minimizer is guaranteed because $T$ is complete and $F(x) \\to \\infty$ as $d(x, O) \\to \\infty$. Therefore, the barycenter $x_{\\ast}$ exists and is unique.\n\n### Task 2: Locating the Barycenter\n\nThe minimizer $x_{\\ast}$ must lie in the convex hull of the points $\\{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}\\} = \\{A, B, C\\}$. In a tree, the convex hull of a set of points is the minimal subtree connecting them. For the points $A, B, C$, this is the union of the three edges $OA$, $OB$, and $OC$.\n\nThe location of the minimizer is determined by a balance of \"forces\". The first-order condition for a minimum can be conceptualized by treating $2w_{i}d(x,p_{i})$ as the magnitude of a \"pull\" exerted at $x$ by the point $p_{i}$.\n\nLet's test if the central vertex $O$ is the barycenter. We evaluate the forces at $O$ pulling into each edge:\n- Force into edge $OA$: $F_{A} = 2w_{1}d(O,A) = 2(1)(3) = 6$.\n- Force into edge $OB$: $F_{B} = 2w_{2}d(O,B) = 2(2)(2) = 8$.\n- Force into edge $OC$: $F_{C} = 2w_{3}d(O,C) = 2(3)(4) = 24$.\n\nFor $O$ to be the minimizer, the force pulling into any single edge must be less than or equal to the sum of the forces pulling into the other edges. Let's check this condition for edge $OC$:\nIs $F_{C} \\le F_{A} + F_{B}$?\nWe find that $24 > 6 + 8 = 14$.\nThe condition is violated. The \"pull\" towards $C$ is stronger than the combined pulls towards $A$ and $B$. This implies that the function $F(x)$ decreases as we move from $O$ into the edge $OC$. Thus, the minimizer $x_{\\ast}$ lies in the interior of the edge $OC$.\n\nLet $x(t)$ be a point on the edge $OC$ at a distance $t = d(O, x(t))$ from $O$, where $t \\in [0, L_{C}] = [0, 4]$. We can express the function $F$ in terms of $t$.\nThe distances from $x(t)$ to the points $A, B, C$ are:\n- $d(x(t), A) = d(x(t), O) + d(O, A) = t + 3$.\n- $d(x(t), B) = d(x(t), O) + d(O, B) = t + 2$.\n- $d(x(t), C) = d(O, C) - d(O, x(t)) = 4 - t$.\n\nThe function to minimize becomes:\n$$\nF(t) = w_{1}d^{2}(x(t), A) + w_{2}d^{2}(x(t), B) + w_{3}d^{2}(x(t), C)\n$$\n$$\nF(t) = 1(t+3)^{2} + 2(t+2)^{2} + 3(4-t)^{2}\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\nF(t) = (t^{2} + 6t + 9) + 2(t^{2} + 4t + 4) + 3(16 - 8t + t^{2})\n$$\n$$\nF(t) = t^{2} + 6t + 9 + 2t^{2} + 8t + 8 + 48 - 24t + 3t^{2}\n$$\nCollecting terms by powers of $t$:\n$$\nF(t) = (1+2+3)t^{2} + (6+8-24)t + (9+8+48)\n$$\n$$\nF(t) = 6t^{2} - 10t + 65\n$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $t$. To find the minimum, we take the derivative with respect to $t$ and set it to $0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt} = 12t - 10\n$$\nSetting $\\frac{dF}{dt} = 0$ gives $12t - 10 = 0$, which yields $t = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\nSince $0 \\le \\frac{5}{6} \\le 4$, this minimum lies within the edge $OC$. The second derivative $\\frac{d^{2}F}{dt^{2}} = 12 > 0$, confirming it is a minimum.\nThe minimizer $x_{\\ast}$ lies on edge $OC$ at a distance $t_{\\ast} = \\frac{5}{6}$ from the central vertex $O$.\n\n### Task 3: General Algorithm for a Finite Metric Tree\n\nGiven a finite metric tree $T$ and a set of points $\\{p_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N} \\subset T$ with positive weights $\\{w_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$, the unique barycenter $x_{\\ast}$ can be computed as follows. The algorithm leverages the fact that the objective function $F(x)$ is strictly convex and is a simple quadratic when restricted to any edge.\n\n1.  **Identify the Search Space**: The barycenter $x_{\\ast}$ must be in the convex hull of the data points $\\{p_i\\}$, which is the minimal subtree $T'$ connecting them. The algorithm operates on $T'$. Assume without loss of generality that all $p_i$ and all branch points are vertices of $T'$.\n\n2.  **Test Vertices**: The barycenter $x_{\\ast}$ is either a vertex or lies in the interior of an edge. We can test each vertex $v \\in T'$ to see if it is the minimizer. For a vertex $v$, let $E_v$ be the set of incident edges. For each edge $e \\in E_v$, let $u_e$ be the unit tangent vector at $v$ pointing into $e$. A vertex $v$ is the barycenter if and only if the directional derivative of $F(x)$ along every outgoing edge is non-negative, i.e., $D_{u_e}F(v) \\ge 0$ for all $e \\in E_v$. This condition is equivalent to a \"force balance\": for each branch starting at $v$ along an edge $e$, the sum of weighted distances to points in that branch is less than or equal to the sum of weighted distances to points in all other branches. Let $S_e = \\{i \\mid \\text{geodesic from } v \\text{ to } p_i \\text{ starts along } e\\}$. The condition for $v=x_{\\ast}$ is that $\\sum_{i \\in S_e} w_i d(v, p_i) \\leq \\sum_{i \\notin S_e} w_i d(v, p_i)$ for all $e \\in E_v$. If such a vertex is found, the algorithm terminates as this is the unique minimizer.\n\n3.  **Identify the Edge**: If no vertex is the barycenter, the convexity of $F(x)$ guarantees that there exists a unique edge $(u,v)$ in $T'$ such that the directional derivative of $F$ at $u$ is negative in the direction of $v$, and the directional derivative at $v$ is negative in the direction of $u$. This means the objective function decreases as one moves from either endpoint into the edge interior. This unique edge contains the barycenter $x_{\\ast}$.\n\n4.  **Minimize along the Edge**: Let the identified edge be $(u,v)$ with length $L=d(u,v)$. Any point $x(t)$ on this edge can be parameterized by its distance $t$ from $u$, where $t \\in [0,L]$. For any data point $p_i$, the distance $d(x(t),p_i)$ is a linear function of $t$. Therefore, the objective function $F(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i d(x(t), p_i)^2$ is a quadratic polynomial of the form $At^2 + Bt + C$, with $A = \\sum w_i > 0$. The minimum of this quadratic is found by solving $\\frac{dF}{dt} = 2At + B = 0$, which gives $t_{\\ast} = -\\frac{B}{2A}$. The conditions from Step 3 ensure that this value $t_{\\ast}$ will lie in the interval $(0,L)$. The barycenter is the point $x(t_{\\ast})$.\n\nThis procedure is guaranteed to find the unique minimizer in a finite number of steps, as it involves a finite number of vertex checks followed by solving a single quadratic equation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{6}}$$", "id": "3029716"}, {"introduction": "The foundation of harmonic map theory lies in the energy functional, as harmonic maps are its critical points.

The target space is a metric tree $T$. The branch $E_{i}$ parametrized by $\\gamma_{i}$ is isometric to the interval $[0, L_{i}]$.

This implies that for any point $x$ in the interior of $R_{i}$, there is a neighborhood of $x$ that is mapped entirely into the single branch $E_{i}$. Within such a neighborhood, the map $u$ behaves like a map from $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, specifically the scalar function $s_{i}$.

For a mapping problem with fixed Dirichlet boundary conditions, the energy functional $E(u)$ is strictly convex when the target manifold $(N,h)$ is a Hadamard manifold (a complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature $K \\le 0$) or, more generally, a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space. This strict convexity guarantees that if an energy minimizer exists, it is unique. The problem asks for counterexamples where this uniqueness fails, which must occur when the target space $N$ is not a Hadamard manifold or $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space.\n\nFor the special case of maps $u$ from the domain $M=[0,1]$ to a target $N$, weak harmonic maps are geodesics of $N$. An energy-minimizing map for fixed boundary data $u(0)=p$ and $u(1)=q$ corresponds to a constant-speed geodesic that minimizes length among all paths connecting $p$ and $q$. Therefore, finding multiple weak harmonic maps with the same boundary data is equivalent to finding a target space $N$ and two points $p, q \\in N$ that are connected by at least two distinct minimizing geodesics.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on this principle.\n\n### Option A\n\nThis option proposes the domain $[0,1]$ and the target as the unit circle $S^{1} \\subset \\mathbb{C}$ with its standard round metric. The boundary values are $u(0)=1$ and $u(1)=-1$, which are antipodal points.\n\n1.  **Target Space**: The target space $N=S^1$ is a compact Riemannian manifold. Its sectional curvature is constant and positive, $K=1 > 0$. It is also not simply connected. Therefore, it is not a Hadamard manifold or a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space. This is a valid setting for a potential counterexample.\n\n2.  **Proposed Maps**: The proposed maps are $\\gamma_{+}(t)=e^{i\\pi t}$ and $\\gamma_{-}(t)=e^{-i\\pi t}$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\n    -   **Boundary Conditions**:\n        -   $\\gamma_{+}(0) = e^{i\\pi(0)} = 1$, $\\gamma_{+}(1) = e^{i\\pi(1)} = -1$.\n        -   $\\gamma_{-}(0) = e^{-i\\pi(0)} = 1$, $\\gamma_{-}(1) = e^{-i\\pi(1)} = -1$.\n        Both maps satisfy the prescribed boundary conditions.\n    -   **Distinctness**: For any $t \\in (0,1)$, $e^{i\\pi t} \\neq e^{-i\\pi t}$, so the maps are distinct.\n    -   **Harmonicity and Energy**: To check if they are weak harmonic maps, we verify if they are constant-speed geodesics.\n        -   The velocity vectors are $\\dot{\\gamma}_{+}(t) = i\\pi e^{i\\pi t}$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_{-}(t) = -i\\pi e^{-i\\pi t}$.\n        -   The speeds are $|\\dot{\\gamma}_{+}(t)| = |i\\pi||e^{i\\pi t}| = \\pi$ and $|\\dot{\\gamma}_{-}(t)| = |-i\\pi||e^{-i\\pi t}| = \\pi$.\n        Since the speeds are constant, both curves are constant-speed parametrizations of geodesics (the two semicircles connecting $1$ and $-1$). As constant-speed geodesics, they are weak harmonic maps in $W^{1,2}([0,1], S^1)$.\n    -   **Energy Minimization**: The length of both curves is $L(\\gamma_{\\pm}) = \\int_{0}^{1} |\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\pm}| dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\pi dt = \\pi$. The distance between antipodal points on the unit circle is $\\pi$, so these are length-minimizing geodesics. The energy functional is $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1 |\\dot{u}|^2 dt$. For a constant-speed curve, this is $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2} L(u)^2$.\n        -   $E(\\gamma_{\\pm}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\pi^2 dt = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi^2$.\n        For any other path $u \\in W^{1,2}$ connecting these points, its length $L(u) \\ge \\pi$. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, its energy satisfies $E(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1 |\\dot{u}|^2 dt \\ge \\frac{1}{2} (\\int_0^1 |\\dot{u}| dt)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} L(u)^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{2}\\pi^2$.\n        Thus, $\\gamma_{+}$ and $\\gamma_{-}$ both achieve the minimum possible energy.\n\nThis option correctly identifies two distinct energy-minimizing weak harmonic maps for the same Dirichlet data. This non-uniqueness is a direct consequence of the positive curvature of $S^1$, which allows for multiple minimizing geodesics between antipodal points.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n### Option B\n\nThis option proposes the domain $[0,1]$ and the target $\\mathbb{R}$, with boundary data $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=1$.\n\n1.  **Target Space**: The target space $N=\\mathbb{R}$ is a complete, simply connected manifold with sectional curvature identically zero. It is a Hadamard manifold and a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space. The uniqueness theorem for energy minimizers applies in this setting. Therefore, this option cannot serve as a counterexample to uniqueness due to failure of non-positive curvature.\n2.  **Proposed Maps**: It suggests two maps: the affine map $u_1(t)=t$ and a \"piecewise constant map that jumps\".\n    -   The map $u_1(t)=t$ is the unique minimizing geodesic between $0$ and $1$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. Its energy is $E(u_1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1 1^2 dt = \\frac{1}{2}$. It is the unique energy-minimizing weak harmonic map.\n    -   A map with a jump discontinuity is not in the Sobolev space $W^{1,2}([0,1], \\mathbb{R})$, as elements of this space must be absolutely continuous. If we interpret \"jumps\" as a limit of steep functions, such as $u_{\\epsilon}(t)$ which is $0$ on $[0,1-\\epsilon]$ and rises linearly to $1$ on $[1-\\epsilon, 1]$, its derivative is $1/\\epsilon$ on an interval of length $\\epsilon$. The energy is $E(u_{\\epsilon}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{1-\\epsilon}^1 (1/\\epsilon)^2 dt = \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon}$, which diverges to $\\infty$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. Such a map is not an energy minimizer.\n\nThis option is incorrect on multiple grounds. The target space ensures uniqueness, and the proposed second map is not a valid competitor for energy minimization.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option C\n\nThis option proposes the domain as the unit disk $D \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ and the target as a Hadamard manifold $N$. It claims that for any continuous boundary map $f:\\partial D \\to N$, there are always at least two distinct energy-minimizing weak harmonic maps.\n\n1.  **Target Space**: The target $N$ is explicitly defined as a Hadamard manifold (complete, simply connected, $K \\le 0$).\n2.  **Claim**: The statement claims non-uniqueness of energy minimizers. This is a direct contradiction of a fundamental result in the theory of harmonic maps, established by Hartman. The theorem states that for a domain $M$ with boundary $\\partial M$ and a target Hadamard manifold $N$, given a suitable map $f: \\partial M \\to N$, there exists a unique harmonic map $u: M \\to N$ with $u|_{\\partial M} = f$, and this map is the unique minimizer of the energy functional in its homotopy class. The conditions specified in this option are precisely those that guarantee uniqueness.\n\nThis option misstates a major theorem.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option D\n\nThis option proposes the domain $[0,1]$ and the target as the flat $2$-torus $\\mathbb{T}^2 = \\mathbb{R}^2 / \\mathbb{Z}^2$. The boundary values are $p=[0,0]$ and $q=[\\frac{1}{2},0]$.\n\n1.  **Target Space**: The flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$ has sectional curvature identically $0$, so it is non-positively curved. However, it is not simply connected (its fundamental group is $\\mathbb{Z}^2$). Therefore, it is not a Hadamard manifold and not a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space. This setting is a valid candidate for a counterexample.\n2.  **Proposed Maps**: The maps are $\\gamma_1(t) = [\\frac{t}{2}, 0]$ and $\\gamma_2(t) = [-\\frac{t}{2}, 0]$.\n    -   **Boundary Conditions**:\n        -   $\\gamma_1(0)=[0,0]=p$, $\\gamma_1(1)=[\\frac{1}{2},0]=q$.\n        -   $\\gamma_2(0)=[0,0]=p$, $\\gamma_2(1)=[-\\frac{1}{2},0]$. On the torus, $[-\\frac{1}{2},0]$ is identified with $[-\\frac{1}{2}+1,0] = [\\frac{1}{2},0]=q$.\n        Both maps satisfy the boundary conditions.\n    -   **Distinctness**: For $t \\in (0,1)$, we have $t \\in (0,1)$. The points $[\\frac{t}{2},0]$ and $[-\\frac{t}{2},0]$ are distinct, since $\\frac{t}{2} - (-\\frac{t}{2}) = t$ is not an integer.\n    -   **Harmonicity and Energy**: The maps are projections of straight lines in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to the torus. We check their speed. The lifts to $\\mathbb{R}^2$ are $\\tilde{\\gamma}_1(t) = (\\frac{t}{2}, 0)$ and $\\tilde{\\gamma}_2(t) = (-\\frac{t}{2}, 0)$.\n        -   The velocities are $\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}_1(t) = (\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ and $\\dot{\\tilde{\\gamma}}_2(t) = (-\\frac{1}{2}, 0)$.\n        -   The speeds are constant: $|\\dot{\\gamma}_1(t)| = |\\dot{\\gamma}_2(t)| = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n        Both are constant-speed geodesics and thus are weak harmonic maps.\n    -   **Energy Minimization**: The length of both curves is $L(\\gamma_{1,2}) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{2} dt = \\frac{1}{2}$. The distance between $p$ and $q$ on $\\mathbb{T}^2$ is the minimum of $\\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{2}+m)^2 + n^2}$ over integers $m,n$, which is achieved for $m=n=0$, giving a distance of $\\frac{1}{2}$. Both curves are length-minimizing geodesics.\n        -   The energy is $E(\\gamma_{1,2}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^1 (\\frac{1}{2})^2 dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n        As constant-speed length-minimizing geodesics, they are both energy minimizers.\n\nThis option correctly identifies two distinct energy-minimizing weak harmonic maps. The non-uniqueness arises because the target space, while having non-positive curvature, is not simply connected, and therefore is not a $\\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ space.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "3029729"}]}
