It is situated within the standard framework of geometric measure theory. The objects—affine planes, Hausdorff measure, Radon measures, and density ratios—are all fundamental concepts in this field. The task is a direct computation based on these definitions, a common exercise in the study of rectifiable sets and minimal surfaces. The problem does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles, contains no ambiguities, and is not based on false premises. Its structure is sound, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nWe are asked to compute the density ratio $\\theta_{x_0}(r)$ for a measure $\\mu$ supported on an $m$-dimensional affine plane $P^m$ with constant multiplicity $q$. The definition is given as:\n$$\n\\theta_{x_0}(r) = \\frac{\\mu\\big(B_r(x_0)\\big)}{\\omega_m \\, r^m}\n$$\nwhere $x_0 \\in P^m$ and $r > 0$.\n\nThe first step is to analyze the numerator, $\\mu(B_r(x_0))$. The measure $\\mu$ is defined as $\\mu = q \\, \\mathcal{H}^m \\llcorner P^m$. By the definition of the restriction of a measure, for any measurable set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, we have $(\\mathcal{H}^m \\llcorner P^m)(A) = \\mathcal{H}^m(A \\cap P^m)$.\nApplying this to our case, where the set is the ball $B_r(x_0)$, we get:\n$$\n\\mu\\big(B_r(x_0)\\big) = (q \\, \\mathcal{H}^m \\llcorner P^m)(B_r(x_0)) = q \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^m(B_r(x_0) \\cap P^m)\n$$\nNow we must identify the set $B_r(x_0) \\cap P^m$ and compute its $m$-dimensional Hausdorff measure.\nThe set $P^m$ is an $m$-dimensional affine plane in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The set $B_r(x_0)$ is an $n$-dimensional open ball of radius $r$. Crucially, the center of the ball, $x_0$, is an element of the plane $P^m$.\nThe intersection of an $m$-dimensional affine plane with an $n$-dimensional ball centered on that plane is an $m$-dimensional ball of the same radius, lying within the plane.\nLet us make this rigorous. Since $P^m$ is an affine plane containing $x_0$, there exists a corresponding $m$-dimensional vector subspace $V^m \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $P^m = x_0 + V^m$. Any point $y \\in P^m$ can be written as $y = x_0 + v$ for some $v \\in V^m$. The condition for $y$ to also be in $B_r(x_0)$ is that the Euclidean distance $\\|y - x_0\\|$ is less than $r$. Substituting $y = x_0 + v$, this becomes $\\|(x_0+v) - x_0\\| < r$, which simplifies to $\\|v\\| < r$.\nThus, the intersection $B_r(x_0) \\cap P^m$ consists of all points $x_0+v$ where $v \\in V^m$ and $\\|v\\| < r$. This is precisely an $m$-dimensional ball of radius $r$ centered at $x_0$ within the affine space $P^m$. We denote this set as $B_r^{P^m}(x_0)$.\n\nOur task reduces to computing $\\mathcal{H}^m(B_r^{P^m}(x_0))$. The Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^m$ is invariant under Euclidean isometries. We can find an isometry $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ that maps the affine plane $P^m$ to the standard coordinate plane $\\mathbb{R}^m \\times \\{0\\}^{n-m}$ and maps the specific point $x_0 \\in P^m$ to the origin $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\nUnder this isometry, the set $B_r^{P^m}(x_0)$ is mapped to the standard $m$-dimensional ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin in $\\mathbb{R}^m$, which we denote by $B_r^{\\mathbb{R}^m}(0)$.\nBecause $\\mathcal{H}^m$ is invariant under isometries, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^m(B_r^{P^m}(x_0)) = \\mathcal{H}^m(B_r^{\\mathbb{R}^m}(0))\n$$\nNext, we use the scaling property of the $m$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. For a scalar $\\lambda > 0$ and a set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m$, $\\mathcal{H}^m(\\lambda A) = \\lambda^m \\mathcal{H}^m(A)$.\nThe ball $B_r^{\\mathbb{R}^m}(0)$ is a scaled version of the unit ball $B_1^{\\mathbb{R}^m}(0)$, specifically $B_r^{\\mathbb{R}^m}(0) = r \\cdot B_1^{\\mathbb{R}^m}(0)$.\nApplying the scaling property with $\\lambda=r$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^m(B_r^{\\mathbb{R}^m}(0)) = r^m \\mathcal{H}^m(B_1^{\\mathbb{R}^m}(0))\n$$\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the definition $\\omega_m := \\mathcal{H}^m(B_1^{\\mathbb{R}^m}(0))$.\nSubstituting this in, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^m(B_r(x_0) \\cap P^m) = \\mathcal{H}^m(B_r^{P^m}(x_0)) = r^m \\omega_m\n$$\nNow we can compute the value of the numerator of the density ratio:\n$$\n\\mu(B_r(x_0)) = q \\cdot \\mathcal{H}^m(B_r(x_0) \\cap P^m) = q \\cdot r^m \\omega_m\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression back into the definition of $\\theta_{x_0}(r)$:\n$$\n\\theta_{x_0}(r) = \\frac{\\mu(B_r(x_0))}{\\omega_m \\, r^m} = \\frac{q \\, r^m \\omega_m}{\\omega_m \\, r^m}\n$$\nSince $r>0$ and $\\omega_m > 0$ for $m \\ge 1$ (the problem is implicitly for $m \\ge 1$ as $\\omega_0$ is usually defined differently or the context implies dimension greater than 0), the term $\\omega_m r^m$ is non-zero, and we can cancel it from the numerator and denominator.\n$$\n\\theta_{x_0}(r) = q\n$$\nThe result is the integer $q$. This expression is independent of the radius $r$ (for all $r>0$) and of the center point $x_0$ (for all $x_0 \\in P^m$). This verifies the claim made in the problem statement. The expression is explicitly a function of $q$, which in this case is simply $q$ itself.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{q}$$", "id": "3036190"}, {"introduction": "The true utility of the monotonicity formula and the concept of density lies in their ability to classify singularities.

A set $K$ is a cone if for any point $p \\in K$ and any scalar $t \\ge 0$, the point $tp$ is also in $K$. Our set $C$ satisfies this property: if $(x,y) \\in C$, then $|x|=|y|$.

The measure of the portion of a $k$-dimensional cone $K$ inside a ball of radius $r$ can be related to the measure of its intersection with the unit sphere, known as the link of the cone. Let $f: K \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be the function $f(p) = |p|$. This function is Lipschitz.

We first compute the $3$-dimensional measure of a single sphere $S^3(R)$ of radius $R$. The surface area (or $(m-1)$-dimensional measure) of an $(m-1)$-sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^m$ is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(S^{m-1}) = \\frac{2\\pi^{m/2}}{\\Gamma(m/2)}\n$$\nFor a $3$-sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^4$, we have $m=4$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^3(S^3) = \\frac{2\\pi^{4/2}}{\\Gamma(4/2)} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{\\Gamma(2)} = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{1!} = 2\\pi^2\n$$\nThe measure of a sphere scales with its radius $R$ as $R^{m-1}$. Thus, for $S^3(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})$ with $R = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and dimension $m-1=3$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^3\\left(S^3\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^3 \\mathcal{H}^3(S^3) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} (2\\pi^2) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe measure of the product manifold $\\Sigma$ is the product of the measures of its factors:\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}^6(\\Sigma) = \\mathcal{H}^3\\left(S^3\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right) \\times \\mathcal{H}^3\\left(S^3\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^4}{2}\n$$\n\nStep 3: Compute the volume of the unit $7$-ball, $\\omega_7$.\nThe volume of the unit $n$-ball, $\\omega_n$, is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\omega_n = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}\n$$\nFor $n=7$, we have:\n$$\n\\omega_7 = \\frac{\\pi^{7/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{7}{2}+1)} = \\frac{\\pi^{7/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{9}{2})}\n$$\nWe compute the Gamma function value using the property $\\Gamma(z+1) = z\\Gamma(z)$ and $\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$:\n$$\n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{105}{16}\\sqrt{\\pi}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\omega_7$:\n$$\n\\omega_7 = \\frac{\\pi^{7/2}}{\\frac{105}{16}\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{16\\pi^3}{105}\n$$\n\nStep 4: Compute the final density $\\Theta_C(0,r)$.\nWe now substitute the values of $\\mathcal{H}^6(\\Sigma)$ and $\\omega_7$ into our expression for the density:\n$$\n\\Theta_C(0,r) = \\frac{\\mathcal{H}^6(\\Sigma)}{7 \\omega_7} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi^4}{2}}{7 \\cdot \\frac{16\\pi^3}{105}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\Theta_C(0,r) = \\frac{\\pi^4}{2} \\cdot \\frac{105}{7 \\cdot 16\\pi^3} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cdot \\frac{105}{112}\n$$\nWe simplify the fraction $\\frac{105}{112}$ by noting that $105 = 7 \\cdot 15$ and $112 = 7 \\cdot 16$:\n$$\n\\frac{105}{112} = \\frac{15}{16}\n$$\nFinally, we obtain the exact value for the density:\n$$\n\\Theta_C(0,r) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cdot \\frac{15}{16} = \\frac{15\\pi}{32}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the density, which is a constant independent of $r$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{15\\pi}{32}}$$", "id": "3036221"}]}
