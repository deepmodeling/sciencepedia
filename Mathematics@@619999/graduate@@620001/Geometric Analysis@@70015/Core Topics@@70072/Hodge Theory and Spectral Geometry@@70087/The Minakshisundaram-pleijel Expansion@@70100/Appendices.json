Its value, $\\frac{1}{6}R(x)$, directly links the local diffusion of heat (or the probability of a random walker returning to the origin) to the local geometry of the space, as measured by the scalar curvature $R(x)$.\n- If $R(x)>0$ (e.g., on a sphere), the volume of small geodesic balls around $x$ is smaller than in Euclidean space. The expansion of the volume element, $\\sqrt{\\det g(y)} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{6}\\mathrm{Ric}_{ij}(x) y^i y^j$, shows this reduction. A smaller local volume \"confines\" the diffusion process, increasing the probability density of finding the particle back at its origin. This corresponds to a positive correction, so $H(t,x,x) > (4\\pi t)^{-n/2}$, thus $a_1(x)>0$.\n- If $R(x)<0$ (e.g., on a hyperbolic space), the volume of small balls is larger. The diffusion process spreads out more, decreasing the return probability, corresponding to a negative correction, so $a_1(x)<0$.\nThe scalar curvature $R(x)$ thus emerges as the precise geometric quantity controlling the leading-order deviation of local diffusion on a curved manifold from diffusion on flat space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{6}R(x)}$$", "id": "3036116"}, {"introduction": "Beyond direct calculation, a deep understanding of geometric quantities comes from analyzing their behavior under fundamental transformations.

Using $\\Delta_{cg} = c^{-1}\\Delta_g$, this becomes $(\\partial_t + c^{-1}\\Delta_g)u = 0$.\nLet us define a new time variable $\\tau = t/c$, so that $\\partial_t = c^{-1}\\partial_\\tau$. The equation becomes $(c^{-1}\\partial_\\tau + c^{-1}\\Delta_g)u = 0$, which simplifies to $(\\partial_\\tau + \\Delta_g)u = 0$.\nThis shows that if $u(t,x)$ is a solution for the metric $cg$ with time $t$, then it is also a solution for the metric $g$ with time $\\tau=t/c$.\nLet $u_{cg}(t,x)$ be the solution for metric $cg$ with initial data $\\phi$, and $u_g(\\tau,x)$ be the solution for metric $g$ with the same initial data. From the argument above, we have $u_{cg}(t,x) = u_g(t/c, x)$.\n\nNow we write this equality in terms of the respective heat kernels:\n$$ \\int_M H_{cg}(t,x,y) \\phi(y) d\\mu_{cg}(y) = \\int_M H_g(t/c, x,y) \\phi(y) d\\mu_g(y) $$\nSubstituting $d\\mu_{cg} = c^{n/2} d\\mu_g$:\n$$ \\int_M H_{cg}(t,x,y) \\phi(y) c^{n/2} d\\mu_g(y) = \\int_M H_g(t/c, x,y) \\phi(y) d\\mu_g(y) $$\nSince this identity must hold for any function $\\phi$, the integrands with respect to the measure $d\\mu_g$ must be equal:\n$$ c^{n/2} H_{cg}(t,x,y) = H_g(t/c, x,y) $$\nTherefore, the heat kernel scales as:\n$$ H_{cg}(t,x,y) = c^{-n/2} H_g(t/c, x,y) $$\nThis holds in particular for the diagonal $y=x$:\n$$ H_{cg}(t,x,x) = c^{-n/2} H_g(t/c, x,x) $$\n\n**4. Scaling of the Minakshisundaram–Pleijel Coefficients**\n\nWe start with the asymptotic expansion for $H_{cg}(t,x,x)$ as $t \\downarrow 0$:\n$$ H_{cg}(t,x,x) \\sim (4\\pi t)^{-n/2}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k(cg;x)\\, t^k \\quad \\text{(LHS)} $$\nNow, we use the scaling relation for $H$ derived above and the expansion for $H_g$:\n$$ H_{cg}(t,x,x) = c^{-n/2} H_g(t/c, x,x) \\sim c^{-n/2} \\left[ (4\\pi (t/c))^{-n/2}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k(g;x)\\, (t/c)^k \\right] $$\nLet's simplify the right-hand side:\n$$ c^{-n/2} \\left[ c^{n/2} (4\\pi t)^{-n/2}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k(g;x)\\, c^{-k} t^k \\right] = (4\\pi t)^{-n/2}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( c^{-k} a_k(g;x) \\right) t^k \\quad \\text{(RHS)} $$\nBy comparing the coefficients of $t^k$ in the LHS and RHS expansions, we obtain the scaling law for the coefficients $a_k$:\n$$ a_k(cg;x) = c^{-k} a_k(g;x) $$\n\n**5. Scaling of the Integrated Coefficients**\n\nThe problem defines $A_k(g) = \\int_M a_k(g;x)\\, d\\mu_g(x)$. Let's compute $A_k(cg)$:\n$$ A_k(cg) = \\int_M a_k(cg;x)\\, d\\mu_{cg}(x) $$\nSubstituting the scaling laws for $a_k(cg;x)$ and $d\\mu_{cg}$:\n$$ A_k(cg) = \\int_M \\left( c^{-k} a_k(g;x) \\right) \\left( c^{n/2} d\\mu_g(x) \\right) $$\nSince $c$ is a constant, we can factor it out of the integral:\n$$ A_k(cg) = c^{n/2-k} \\int_M a_k(g;x)\\, d\\mu_g(x) = c^{n/2-k} A_k(g) $$\n\n**Evaluation of the Options**\n\n- **A.
