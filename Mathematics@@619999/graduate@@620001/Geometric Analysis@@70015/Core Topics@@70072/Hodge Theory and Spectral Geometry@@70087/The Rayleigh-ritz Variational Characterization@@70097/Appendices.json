Strong convergence of the traces is guaranteed if the trace operator $T: H^1(\\Omega) \\to L^2(\\partial\\Omega)$ is a compact operator, as compact operators map weakly convergent sequences to strongly convergent ones.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option based on this framework.\n\n**A. Correct.** For a bounded Lipschitz domain, its boundary is a compact Lipschitz hypersurface. As stated in the baseline facts, the trace operator $T: H^1(\\Omega) \\to H^{1/2}(\\partial\\Omega)$ is bounded, and the Rellich-Kondrachov type embedding $H^{1/2}(\\partial\\Omega) \\hookrightarrow L^2(\\partial\\Omega)$ is compact. The composition of a bounded operator and a compact operator is compact. Therefore, $T: H^1(\\Omega) \\to L^2(\\partial\\Omega)$ is compact. This compactness ensures that a weakly convergent subsequence $u_k \\rightharpoonup u$ in $H^1(\\Omega)$ gives rise to a strongly convergent trace subsequence $Tu_k \\to Tu$ in $L^2(\\partial\\Omega)$, allowing one to pass to the limit in the normalization constraint and prove the existence of a minimizer.\n\n**B. Incorrect.** Finite Hausdorff measure is a very weak condition on the boundary's regularity. It does not guarantee the uniform cone condition, which is a standard requirement for the trace operator to be well-behaved. For domains with highly irregular boundaries (like certain cusps or fractal shapes) that can still have finite boundary measure, the trace operator $T: H^1(\\Omega) \\to L^2(\\partial\\Omega)$ is not compact (and may not even be bounded).\n\n**C. Correct.** This statement accurately describes the failure of the direct method when the trace operator is not compact. If $T$ is not compact, a weakly convergent sequence $u_k \\rightharpoonup u$ does not guarantee strong convergence of the traces. It's possible for the weak limit of the traces to have a smaller norm, i.e., $\\|Tu\\|_{L^2(\\partial\\Omega)}  \\liminf \\|Tu_k\\|_{L^2(\\partial\\Omega)} = 1$. This \"loss of mass\" in the trace means the limit function $u$ does not satisfy the normalization constraint, and a minimizer may not exist.\n\n**D. Correct.** This statement provides a detailed and accurate summary of the logic for the existence of a minimizer on Lipschitz domains. It correctly identifies that the compactness of $T: H^1(\\Omega) \\to L^2(\\partial\\Omega)$ arises from composing the bounded trace map to $H^{1/2}(\\partial\\Omega)$ with the compact embedding into $L^2(\\partial\\Omega)$. It correctly labels this compactness as the \"key ingredient\" that enables the \"passage to the limit in the normalization constraints,\" which, along with weak lower semicontinuity of the energy, completes the existence proof.\n\n**E. Incorrect.** The Steklov eigenvalue problem can be formulated as $\\Lambda \\phi = \\sigma \\phi$, where $\\phi = u|_{\\partial\\Omega}$ and $\\Lambda$ is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator. For a domain with a $C^1$ (or even Lipschitz) boundary, the DtN operator is an unbounded elliptic pseudodifferential operator of order 1. Its inverse, the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, is a compact, self-adjoint operator on the space of $L^2(\\partial\\Omega)$ functions with zero mean. The eigenvalues of a compact operator form a sequence that accumulates at 0. If the eigenvalues of the inverse are $\\mu_k \\to 0$, then the eigenvalues of the original DtN operator are $\\sigma_k = 1/\\mu_k$, which must accumulate at $+\\infty$.
