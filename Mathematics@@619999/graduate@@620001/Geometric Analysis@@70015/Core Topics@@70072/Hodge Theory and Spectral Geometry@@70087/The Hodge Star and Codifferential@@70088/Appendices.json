For the vector field $\\vec{A}$, a direct calculation shows that $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{A} = 0$ for all points in $\\mathbb{R}^{3} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. In the language of forms, this corresponds to the exterior derivative of $\\alpha$ being zero, $d\\alpha=0$. A form $\\omega$ is called closed if $d\\omega=0$ and co-closed if $\\delta\\omega=0$.
