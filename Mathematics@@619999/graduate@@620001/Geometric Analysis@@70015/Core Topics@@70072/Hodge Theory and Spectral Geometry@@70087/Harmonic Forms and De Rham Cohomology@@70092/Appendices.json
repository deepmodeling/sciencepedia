The givens and definitions are self-contained, mathematically sound, and well-posed. All axioms provided for the exterior derivative $d$ are standard. The specialized cases for curl and divergence are canonical examples. The notation $dx^{\\hat{\\imath}}$ is slightly ambiguous as written, but its meaning as $*dx^i$ is uniquely determined by the context of the subsequent formula for divergence. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nLet $M=\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be endowed with standard coordinates $(x^{1},\\dots,x^{n})$. A smooth $k$-form $\\alpha$ on $M$ is given in coordinates by\n$$\n\\alpha=\\sum_{|I|=k} f_{I}(x)\\,dx^{I}\n$$\nwhere the sum is over all ordered multi-indices $I=(i_{1}<\\cdots<i_{k})$ of length $k$, the coefficients $f_{I}$ are smooth functions in $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, and $dx^{I} = dx^{i_{1}}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_{k}}$.\n\nWe are tasked to derive a coordinate expression for $d\\alpha$ using only the following properties of the exterior derivative $d$:\n1.  Linearity: $d(c_1\\omega_1 + c_2\\omega_2) = c_1 d\\omega_1 + c_2 d\\omega_2$ for constants $c_1, c_2$.\n2.  Graded Leibniz rule: For a $p$-form $\\omega$, $d(\\omega\\wedge\\eta)=d\\omega\\wedge\\eta+(-1)^{p}\\,\\omega\\wedge d\\eta$.\n3.  Nilpotency: $d\\circ d=0$.\n4.  Action on $0$-forms (functions): For $f\\in C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})$, $df=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}}\\,dx^{j}$.\n\nWe apply these properties step-by-step to find $d\\alpha$.\n\nFirst, by linearity, we can apply $d$ to each term in the sum for $\\alpha$:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d\\left(\\sum_{|I|=k} f_{I} dx^{I}\\right) = \\sum_{|I|=k} d(f_{I} dx^{I})\n$$\nThe product $f_{I}dx^{I}$ is the wedge product of a $0$-form $f_I$ and a $k$-form $dx^I$. Applying the graded Leibniz rule with $\\deg(f_I)=0$:\n$$\nd(f_{I} dx^{I}) = d(f_{I} \\wedge dx^{I}) = (df_{I}) \\wedge dx^{I} + (-1)^{0} f_{I} \\wedge d(dx^{I}) = df_{I} \\wedge dx^{I} + f_{I} d(dx^{I})\n$$\nNext, we evaluate $d(dx^{I})$. For any coordinate $1$-form $dx^{j}$, it is by definition the exterior derivative of the coordinate function $x^j$, so $dx^j = d(x^j)$. Using the nilpotency property $d \\circ d = 0$, we have $d(dx^j) = d(d(x^j)) = 0$.\nThe basis $k$-form $dx^I = dx^{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{i_k}$ is a wedge product of exact $1$-forms. Applying the Leibniz rule repeatedly, we find that $d(dx^I)$ is a sum of terms each containing a factor $d(dx^{i_m})=0$. For instance, $d(dx^{i_1} \\wedge dx^{i_2}) = d(dx^{i_1}) \\wedge dx^{i_2} - dx^{i_1} \\wedge d(dx^{i_2}) = 0 \\wedge dx^{i_2} - dx^{i_1} \\wedge 0 = 0$. By induction, $d(dx^I)=0$ for any multi-index $I$.\nThus, the expression for $d(f_I dx^I)$ simplifies to:\n$$\nd(f_{I} dx^{I}) = df_{I} \\wedge dx^{I}\n$$\nNow, we use the definition of $d$ on $0$-forms for $df_I$:\n$$\ndf_{I} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial f_{I}}{\\partial x^{j}}\\,dx^{j}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $d\\alpha$:\n$$\nd\\alpha = \\sum_{|I|=k} \\left( \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial f_{I}}{\\partial x^{j}}\\,dx^{j} \\right) \\wedge dx^{I} \\right)\n$$\nBy linearity of the wedge product, we can write this as:\n$$\nd\\alpha = \\sum_{|I|=k} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f_{I}}{\\partial x^{j}} dx^{j} \\wedge dx^{I}\n$$\nThis is the explicit coordinate expression for $d\\alpha$. The exterior product $dx^j \\wedge dx^I$ is zero if the index $j$ is contained in the multi-index $I$. Otherwise, it is a $(k+1)$-form, which can be rearranged to a standard basis $(k+1)$-form with an appropriate sign change.\n\nNow we specialize this result to the two cases requested.\n\n**Case 1: Curl in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ ($n=3, k=1$)**\nLet the coordinates be $(x^1, x^2, x^3)$ and let $\\alpha$ be a $1$-form:\n$$\n\\alpha = f_1 dx^1 + f_2 dx^2 + f_3 dx^3\n$$\nHere, the multi-indices are $I=(1), (2), (3)$, and we denote $f_{(i)}$ as $f_i$.\nUsing the general formula:\n$$\nd\\alpha = d(f_1 dx^1) + d(f_2 dx^2) + d(f_3 dx^3) = df_1 \\wedge dx^1 + df_2 \\wedge dx^2 + df_3 \\wedge dx^3\n$$\nExpanding $df_i = \\sum_{j=1}^3 \\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial x^j} dx^j$ and using $dx^j \\wedge dx^j=0$ and $dx^j \\wedge dx^i = -dx^i \\wedge dx^j$:\n\\begin{align*}\nd\\alpha &= \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^2}dx^2 \\wedge dx^1 + \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^3}dx^3 \\wedge dx^1\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^1}dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 + \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^3}dx^3 \\wedge dx^2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^1}dx^1 \\wedge dx^3 + \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^2}dx^2 \\wedge dx^3\\right) \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^1} - \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^2}\\right) dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^1} - \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^3}\\right) dx^1 \\wedge dx^3 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^3}\\right) dx^2 \\wedge dx^3\n\\end{align*}\nUnder the musical isomorphism, $\\alpha$ corresponds to the vector field $F = (f_1, f_2, f_3)$. The curl of $F$ is $\\nabla \\times F = (\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^3}, \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^3} - \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^1}, \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^1} - \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^2})$.\nThe problem asks to show the correspondence via the Hodge star operator $*$. With the standard orientation, the Hodge star maps $2$-forms to $1$-forms in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as follows: $*(dx^2 \\wedge dx^3)=dx^1$, $*(dx^3 \\wedge dx^1)=dx^2$, and $*(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2)=dx^3$.\nApplying $*$ to $d\\alpha$ and using $dx^1 \\wedge dx^3 = -dx^3 \\wedge dx^1$:\n\\begin{align*}\n*d\\alpha &= \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^3}\\right) *(dx^2 \\wedge dx^3) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^3} - \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^1}\\right) *(dx^3 \\wedge dx^1) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^1} - \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^2}\\right) *(dx^1 \\wedge dx^2) \\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^3}\\right) dx^1 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^3} - \\frac{\\partial f_3}{\\partial x^1}\\right) dx^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f_2}{\\partial x^1} - \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x^2}\\right) dx^3\n\\end{align*}\nThis resulting $1$-form corresponds, via the musical isomorphism, precisely to the vector field $\\nabla \\times F$. Thus $d$ on $1$-forms followed by the Hodge star corresponds to the curl operator.\n\n**Case 2: Divergence ($k=n-1$)**\nAn $(n-1)$-form is given as $\\beta=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i}(x)\\,dx^{\\hat{\\imath}}$. For the identity $d\\beta=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\partial b_{i}}{\\partial x^{i}}\\right)\\,dx^{1}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{n}$ to hold, the basis form $dx^{\\hat{\\imath}}$ must be interpreted as $dx^{\\hat{\\imath}} = *dx^i = (-1)^{i-1} dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge\\widehat{dx^{i}}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n}$.\nLet $\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i(x) (dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge\\widehat{dx^{i}}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n})$, where $c_i(x) = (-1)^{i-1}b_i(x)$.\nTaking the exterior derivative:\n$$\nd\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^n dc_i \\wedge (dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge\\widehat{dx^{i}}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n})\n$$\nSubstituting $dc_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x^j} dx^j$, the only non-vanishing terms in the wedge product are for $j=i$:\n$$\nd\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x^i} dx^i \\wedge (dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge\\widehat{dx^{i}}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n})\n$$\nMoving $dx^i$ to the $i$-th position requires $i-1$ swaps, so $dx^i \\wedge (dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge\\widehat{dx^{i}}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n}) = (-1)^{i-1} dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n}$.\n$$\nd\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x^i} (-1)^{i-1} (dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n})\n$$\nSubstituting back $c_i = (-1)^{i-1}b_i$, we get $\\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial x^i} = (-1)^{i-1}\\frac{\\partial b_i}{\\partial x^i}$.\n$$\nd\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( (-1)^{i-1}\\frac{\\partial b_i}{\\partial x^i} \\right) (-1)^{i-1} (dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n}) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial b_i}{\\partial x^i}\\right) dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n}\n$$\nThis confirms the expression given in the problem. The vector field associated with the coefficients $b_i$ is $B = \\sum_{i=1}^n b_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$. Its divergence is $\\text{div}(B) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial b_i}{\\partial x^i}$. The $(n-1)$-form $\\beta$ is precisely the Hodge dual of the $1$-form $B^\\flat = \\sum b_i dx^i$, i.e., $\\beta = *(B^\\flat)$. Our result shows $d\\beta = (\\text{div}(B)) \\text{vol}_n$, where $\\text{vol}_n = dx^{1}\\wedge\\dots\\wedge dx^{n}$. This demonstrates that the exterior derivative $d$ applied to the $(n-1)$-form dual to a vector field's $1$-form produces the volume form scaled by the vector field's divergence.\n\nThe primary result of the derivation is the general coordinate expression for the exterior derivative of a $k$-form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sum_{|I|=k} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial f_{I}}{\\partial x^{j}} dx^{j} \\wedge dx^{I}}$$", "id": "3029575"}, {"introduction": "While the exterior derivative allows us to analyze the local properties of forms, de Rham cohomology reveals global, topological information about the underlying manifold.

The Riemannian volume form is $\\operatorname{vol} = \\sqrt{a(x_{1})}\\,dx_{1} \\wedge dx_{2}$.\n\nChoose the orthonormal coframe $\\theta^{1} = \\sqrt{a(x_{1})}\\,dx_{1}$ and $\\theta^{2} = dx_{2}$.
