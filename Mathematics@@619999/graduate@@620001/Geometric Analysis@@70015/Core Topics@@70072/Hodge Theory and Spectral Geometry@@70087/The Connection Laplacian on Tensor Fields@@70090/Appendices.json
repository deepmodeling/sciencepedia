It is a standard and well-posed request in differential geometry to derive the local coordinate expression for the covariant derivative of a general tensor field from the axioms of an affine connection.

Let $T$ be a smooth tensor field of type $(r,s)$ on an open chart $U \\subset M$. In local coordinates $\\{x^i\\}$, with basis vector fields $\\{\\partial_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\}$ and basis one-forms $\\{dx^i\\}$, the tensor field $T$ can be written as:\n$$\nT = T^{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}{}_{j_{1}\\dots j_{s}} (\\partial_{i_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\partial_{i_{r}}) \\otimes (dx^{j_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes dx^{j_{s}})\n$$\nIn this expression, the Einstein summation convention is used for all pairs of repeated upper and lower indices.

The operator $\\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell}$ is the covariant derivative in the direction of the basis vector field $\\partial_\\ell$.\n\nThe derivation is structured in the following steps:\n1.  Apply the Leibniz rule for a product of a scalar function and a tensor.\n2.  Determine the covariant derivative of the basis vectors and covectors.\n3.  Apply the Leibniz rule for tensor products to find the derivative of the full basis tensor.\n4.  Combine the results to obtain the final expression for the components of $\\nabla_{\\ell} T$.\n\n**Step 1: Application of the Leibniz Rule for Scalar Multiplication**\nThe connection $\\nabla$ satisfies the property $\\nabla_X(fS) = (Xf)S + f(\\nabla_X S)$ for a vector field $X$, a scalar function $f$, and a tensor field $S$. In our case, $X = \\partial_\\ell$, the scalar functions are the components $T^{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}{}_{j_{1}\\dots j_{s}}$, and the tensor is the basis element. This gives:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} T = \\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} \\left( T^{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}{}_{j_{1}\\dots j_{s}} \\partial_{i_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes dx^{j_{s}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= (\\partial_\\ell T^{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}{}_{j_{1}\\dots j_{s}}) (\\partial_{i_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes dx^{j_{s}}) + T^{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}{}_{j_{1}\\dots j_{s}} \\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} (\\partial_{i_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes dx^{j_{s}})\n$$\nHere, $\\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell}$ acting on the scalar function $T^{...}_{...}$ is simply the partial derivative $\\partial_\\ell = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\ell}$.\n\n**Step 2: Covariant Derivatives of Basis Vectors and Covectors**\nThe covariant derivative of a basis vector field $\\partial_j$ with respect to $\\partial_i$ is given by the definition of the Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma^k{}_{ij}$:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\partial_{i}} \\partial_{j} = \\Gamma^{k}{}_{ij} \\partial_{k}\n$$\nFor our specific case, taking the derivative along $\\partial_\\ell$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\partial_{\\ell}} \\partial_{j} = \\Gamma^{k}{}_{\\ell j} \\partial_{k}\n$$\nTo find the covariant derivative of a basis covector $dx^j$, we use the axiom of compatibility with the natural pairing. The pairing of a covector and a vector, $\\langle dx^j, \\partial_k \\rangle = \\delta^j_k$, is a constant (the Kronecker delta). The covariant derivative of a constant is zero. Applying the Leibniz rule for pairings, $X\\langle\\omega, Y\\rangle = \\langle \\nabla_X \\omega, Y \\rangle + \\langle \\omega, \\nabla_X Y \\rangle$, we have:\n$$\n0 = \\partial_\\ell(\\delta^j_k) = \\partial_\\ell \\langle dx^j, \\partial_k \\rangle = \\langle \\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} dx^j, \\partial_k \\rangle + \\langle dx^j, \\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} \\partial_k \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} \\partial_k$:\n$$\n0 = \\langle \\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} dx^j, \\partial_k \\rangle + \\langle dx^j, \\Gamma^m{}_{\\ell k} \\partial_m \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the pairing:\n$$\n0 = \\langle \\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} dx^j, \\partial_k \\rangle + \\Gamma^m{}_{\\ell k} \\langle dx^j, \\partial_m \\rangle = \\langle \\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} dx^j, \\partial_k \\rangle + \\Gamma^m{}_{\\ell k} \\delta^j_m = \\langle \\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} dx^j, \\partial_k \\rangle + \\Gamma^j{}_{\\ell k}\n$$\nThe quantity $\\langle \\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} dx^j, \\partial_k \\rangle$ is the $k$-th component of the one-form $\\nabla_{\\partial_\\ell} dx^j$.

The tensor $\\nabla_\\ell T$ is the sum of these terms. We find its components by identifying the coefficients of the basis tensors $\\partial_{i_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\partial_{i_{r}} \\otimes dx^{j_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes dx^{j_{s}}$.\n\nThe first term, $(\\partial_\\ell T^{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}{}_{j_{1}\\dots j_{s}})(\\partial_{i_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes dx^{j_{s}})$, directly contributes $\\partial_\\ell T^{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}{}_{j_{1}\\dots j_{s}}$ to the component $(\\nabla_{\\ell} T)^{i_{1}\\dots i_{r}}{}_{j_{1}\\dots j_{s}}$.\n\nFor the contravariant correction terms, consider the $k$-th term in the sum:\n$$\nT^{q_1 \\dots q_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s} (\\partial_{q_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\Gamma^p_{\\ell q_k}\\partial_p \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\partial_{q_r}) \\otimes (\\dots)\n$$\n(We rename the summation indices of $T$ to $q$'s to avoid confusion).

The index $q_k$ is summed over. Renaming $q_k$ to $p$ (as it is a dummy index), the contribution to the final component is:\n$$\n+\\Gamma^{i_k}_{\\ell p} T^{i_1 \\dots i_{k-1} p i_{k+1} \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s}\n$$\nSumming over $k=1, \\dots, r$ gives all contravariant correction terms.\n\nFor the covariant correction terms, consider the $k$-th term in the sum:\n$$\nT^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{q_1 \\dots q_s} (\\dots) \\otimes (dx^{q_{1}} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes (-\\Gamma^{q_k}_{\\ell p}dx^p) \\otimes \\dots \\otimes dx^{q_s})\n$$\nTo find the coefficient of the basis element with lower indices $j_1, \\dots, j_s$, we must set $q_1=j_1, \\dots, q_{k-1}=j_{k-1}, p=j_k, \\dots, q_s=j_s$.

The problem states that either $T$ or $U$ must have compact support for the adjoint definition to hold via integration by parts. The formal adjoint $\\nabla^*$ of the covariant derivative operator $\\nabla$ is defined by the relation for the $L^2$ inner product:\n$$\n\\langle \\nabla T, U \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle T, \\nabla^* U \\rangle_{L^2}\n$$\nThe $L^2$ inner product is the integral of the pointwise inner product over the manifold:\n$$\n\\langle A, B \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} \\langle A(x), B(x) \\rangle_x \\, dV_g\n$$\nwhere $dV_g$ is the volume form associated with the metric $g$.\n\nIn standard Cartesian coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the metric tensor $\\delta$ has components $\\delta_{ij}$, which is the Kronecker delta. The determinant of the metric is $\\det(\\delta_{ij}) = 1$. Thus, the volume form is simply the standard Lebesgue measure, $dV_g = dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n$, which we denote by $dV$.\n\nThe pointwise inner product of two tensors, for instance two $(r,s)$-tensors $A$ and $B$, is given by contracting all corresponding indices using the metric. In Cartesian coordinates, where $\\delta_{ij}$ and its inverse $\\delta^{ij}$ are the identity matrix, this simplifies to the sum of the products of their corresponding components:\n$$\n\\langle A, B \\rangle_x = \\sum_{i_1, \\dots, i_r, j_1, \\dots, j_s} A^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s} B_{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}^{j_1 \\dots j_s} = \\sum_{i_1, \\dots, i_r, j_1, \\dots, j_s} A^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s} B^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s}\n$$\nHereafter, we use Einstein summation convention and multi-index notation $I = (i_1, \\dots, i_r)$ and $J = (j_1, \\dots, j_s)$ for brevity, so $\\langle A, B \\rangle_x = A^I{}_J B^I{}_J$.\n\nThe first task is to derive the formula for $\\nabla^* \\nabla T$. This is a two-step process: first find the action of $\\nabla$, then find the action of $\\nabla^*$.\n\n**Step A: The Covariant Derivative $\\nabla$**\nThe general coordinate expression for the covariant derivative of a type-$(r,s)$ tensor $T$ is:\n$$\n(\\nabla_k T)^I{}_J = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} T^I{}_J + \\sum_{p=1}^r \\Gamma^{i_p}_{m k} T^{i_1 \\dots m \\dots i_r}{}_J - \\sum_{q=1}^s \\Gamma^m_{j_q k} T^I{}_{j_1 \\dots m \\dots j_s}\n$$\nAs per the problem statement, in standard Cartesian coordinates for the flat metric $\\delta$, all Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection are zero: $\\Gamma^i_{jk} = 0$.

By identification, we find the components of the type-$(r,s)$ tensor $\\nabla^* U$:\n$$\n(\\nabla^* U)^I{}_J = - \\partial_k U^I{}_{Jk} = - \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} U^I{}_{Jk}\n$$\nThis operator is the negative of the covariant divergence applied to the last index.\n\n**Step C: The Connection Laplacian $\\nabla^* \\nabla$**\nNow we combine these results to find the components of $\\nabla^* \\nabla T$. We apply the operator $\\nabla^*$ to the tensor field $U = \\nabla T$.\nThe components of $U$ are $U^I{}_{Jk} = (\\nabla T)^I{}_{Jk} = \\partial_k T^I{}_J$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\nabla^* U$:\n$$\n(\\nabla^* \\nabla T)^I{}_J = (\\nabla^* U)^I{}_J = - \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} U^I{}_{Jk} = - \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} T^I{}_J \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\nabla^* \\nabla T)^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s} = - \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2}{(\\partial x^k)^2} T^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s}\n$$\nThis is the desired coordinate formula. It shows that in standard Cartesian coordinates on Euclidean space, the connection Laplacian acts as the negative of the standard Laplacian operator, $\\Delta = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2}{(\\partial x^k)^2}$, on each component of the tensor field $T$.\n\n### Specialization to a Tensor Field with Constant Coefficients\n\nThe problem next requires us to specialize this formula to a tensor field $T$ whose components $T^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s}$ are constant functions in the standard Cartesian coordinate system.\nLet $T^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s}(x) = C^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, where the $C$'s are constants.\n\nThe derived local formula $(\\nabla^* \\nabla T)^I{}_J = - \\Delta (T^I{}_J)$ is valid point-wise and does not depend on the compact support assumption, although the derivation of the adjoint operator's form relied on it. We can therefore apply this local differential operator to any sufficiently smooth tensor field.\n\nFor a constant function $f(x) = c$, all its partial derivatives are zero. Specifically, for any component $T^I{}_J$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k} T^I{}_J = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}\n$$\nConsequently, the second partial derivatives are also zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2}{(\\partial x^k)^2} T^I{}_J = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our formula for the connection Laplacian:\n$$\n(\\nabla^* \\nabla T)^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s} = - \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial^2}{(\\partial x^k)^2} T^{i_1 \\dots i_r}{}_{j_1 \\dots j_s} = - \\sum_{k=1}^n 0 = 0\n$$\nThis result holds for all components $(i_1, \\dots, i_r, j_1, \\dots, j_s)$.

We are given the Weitzenböck identity for $1$-forms $\\omega \\in \\Omega^1(M)$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{H} \\omega = (\\nabla^{*}\\nabla \\omega) + \\mathrm{Ric}(\\omega)\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta_{H} = d\\,d^{*} + d^{*} d$ is the Hodge Laplacian on $1$-forms, $\\nabla^{*}\\nabla$ is the connection Laplacian on $1$-forms, and $\\mathrm{Ric}$ is the Ricci tensor acting as an endomorphism on $1$-forms.\n\nWe apply this identity to the specific $1$-form $\\omega = df$, where $f$ is a smooth function on the manifold and $d$ is the exterior derivative. Substituting $\\omega=df$ into the Weitzenböck identity gives:\n$$\n\\Delta_{H}(df) = \\nabla^{*}\\nabla(df) + \\mathrm{Ric}(df)\n$$\nLet's analyze the term on the left-hand side, $\\Delta_{H}(df)$. Using the definition of the Hodge Laplacian, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta_{H}(df) = (d\\,d^{*} + d^{*} d)(df) = d(d^{*}(df)) + d^{*}(d(df))\n$$\nWe use two fundamental properties. First, the exterior derivative squares to zero, i.e., $d^{2} = 0$. Applying $d$ to the $1$-form $df$ yields the $2$-form $d(df) = d^{2}f = 0$. This simplifies the second term:\n$$\nd^{*}(d(df)) = d^{*}(0) = 0\n$$\nSecond, the Laplace–Beltrami operator on functions is defined as $\\Delta f := d^{*} d f$. Therefore, the first term becomes:\n$$\nd(d^{*}(df)) = d(\\Delta f)\n$$\nCombining these results, we find a crucial identity for the action of the Hodge Laplacian on an exact $1$-form:\n$$\n\\Delta_{H}(df) = d(\\Delta f)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our specialized Weitzenböck identity yields an equation relating $1$-forms:\n$$\nd(\\Delta f) = \\nabla^{*}\\nabla(df) + \\mathrm{Ric}(df)\n$$\nThis equation holds on any Riemannian manifold. To obtain the desired expression for vector fields, we use the musical isomorphism $\\sharp: \\Omega^1(M) \\to \\mathfrak{X}(M)$, which maps a $1$-form to its corresponding vector field via the metric $g$. Applying $\\sharp$ to each term in the equation:\n$$\n(d(\\Delta f))^{\\sharp} = (\\nabla^{*}\\nabla(df))^{\\sharp} + (\\mathrm{Ric}(df))^{\\sharp}\n$$\nWe now identify each term as a vector field:\n$1$. For any function $\\phi$, the vector field corresponding to the $1$-form $d\\phi$ is the gradient of $\\phi$, denoted $\\nabla \\phi$. Thus, $(d(\\Delta f))^{\\sharp} = \\nabla(\\Delta f)$.\n$2$. The connection Laplacian on vector fields is defined to be compatible with the connection Laplacian on $1$-forms via the musical isomorphisms. That is, for any vector field $X$, $(\\nabla^{*}\\nabla(X^{\\flat}))^{\\sharp} = \\nabla^{*}\\nabla X$. In our case, $X = \\nabla f$, so its dual $1$-form is $X^{\\flat} = (\\nabla f)^{\\flat} = df$. Therefore, $(\\nabla^{*}\\nabla(df))^{\\sharp} = \\nabla^{*}\\nabla(\\nabla f)$.\n$3$. The Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}$ is a symmetric $(0,2)$-tensor. It maps a pair of vector fields to a real number. It also defines an endomorphism on the tangent bundle, also denoted $\\mathrm{Ric}$, which maps a vector field $X$ to a vector field $\\mathrm{Ric}(X)$ defined by $g(\\mathrm{Ric}(X), Y) = \\mathrm{Ric}(X, Y)$ for all vector fields $Y$. The term $\\mathrm{Ric}(df)$ represents the action of this endomorphism on the $1$-form $df$, and $(\\mathrm{Ric}(df))^{\\sharp}$ is the corresponding action on the vector field $\\nabla f$. We denote this resulting vector field by $\\mathrm{Ric}(\\nabla f)$.\n\nWith these identifications, the vector field equation becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla(\\Delta f) = \\nabla^{*}\\nabla(\\nabla f) + \\mathrm{Ric}(\\nabla f)\n$$\nThis is the general Bochner commutation formula relating the gradient of the Laplacian to the Laplacian of the gradient. Rearranging the terms to solve for the quantity of interest, we obtain:\n$$\n\\nabla^{*}\\nabla(\\nabla f) = \\nabla(\\Delta f) - \\mathrm{Ric}(\\nabla f)\n$$\nThis expression holds on any Riemannian manifold. The final step is to specialize this result to the unit round sphere $(S^n, g)$. The problem states that the Ricci curvature of the unit sphere is given by $\\mathrm{Ric} = (n-1)g$. This means that for any two vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $S^n$, $\\mathrm{Ric}(X, Y) = (n-1)g(X, Y)$.\n\nFrom this, we can determine the action of the Ricci endomorphism on an arbitrary vector field $X$. By definition, the vector field $\\mathrm{Ric}(X)$ is such that for any $Y$, $g(\\mathrm{Ric}(X), Y) = \\mathrm{Ric}(X, Y)$. Substituting the property of the sphere's curvature, we have:\n$$\ng(\\mathrm{Ric}(X), Y) = (n-1)g(X, Y)\n$$\nSince this holds for all vector fields $Y$, we must have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(X) = (n-1)X\n$$\nThis result applies to any vector field on $S^n$. We apply it to the specific vector field $X = \\nabla f$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(\\nabla f) = (n-1)\\nabla f\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this specific form of the Ricci term into our general expression for $\\nabla^{*}\\nabla(\\nabla f)$:\n$$\n\\nabla^{*}\\nabla(\\nabla f) = \\nabla(\\Delta f) - (n-1)\\nabla f\n$$\nThis is the final, completely simplified expression for the vector field $\\nabla^{*}\\nabla(\\nabla f)$ on the unit sphere $S^n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\nabla(\\Delta f) - (n-1)\\nabla f}\n$$", "id": "3034604"}]}
