The solution will be formulated using the provided assumptions: the Faber-Krahn inequality, the variational characterization of $\\lambda_{1}$, and the analysis of the eigenvalue problem on a disk.\n\nFirst, we address the core of the problem, which is to find the minimum of $\\lambda_{1}(\\Omega)$ over the set of all bounded, open sets $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with a fixed measure $|\\Omega|=A$.\nThe Faber-Krahn inequality asserts that, among all domains of a given area, the disk is the unique minimizer of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue. Therefore, the minimal value we seek is precisely the first eigenvalue of a disk whose area is $A$. Let this disk be denoted by $B^*$.\n\nThe area of a disk with radius $r$ is given by $\\pi r^{2}$. If the area of our disk $B^*$ is $A$, its radius, which we shall denote by $r^*$, must satisfy the relation:\n$$ \\pi (r^*)^{2} = A $$\nSolving for $r^*$, we find:\n$$ r^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{\\pi}} $$\n\nNext, we must determine the first eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{1}(B^*)$, for this disk $B^*$ of radius $r^*$. This involves solving the Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the disk:\n$$ -\\Delta u = \\lambda u \\quad \\text{in } B^* $$\n$$ u = 0 \\quad \\text{on } \\partial B^* $$\nWe employ polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where the Laplacian operator is given by:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2} $$\nThe eigenvalue problem becomes:\n$$ -\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial \\theta^2}\\right) = \\lambda u $$\nWe seek a non-trivial solution using the method of separation of variables, assuming the eigenfunction $u(r, \\theta)$ can be written as a product of a radial function $R(r)$ and an angular function $\\Theta(\\theta)$, i.e., $u(r, \\theta) = R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the equation and rearranging terms yields:\n$$ \\frac{r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r)}{R(r)} + \\lambda r^2 = -\\frac{\\Theta''(\\theta)}{\\Theta(\\theta)} $$\nSince the left side depends only on $r$ and the right side depends only on $\\theta$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we denote by $m^2$.\n\nThe angular equation is $\\Theta''(\\theta) + m^2 \\Theta(\\theta) = 0$. For the solution to be single-valued in the domain, we must have $\\Theta(\\theta+2\\pi) = \\Theta(\\theta)$. This physical constraint implies that $m$ must be a non-negative integer, $m \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$.\n\nThe radial equation is:\n$$ r^2 R''(r) + r R'(r) + (\\lambda r^2 - m^2)R(r) = 0 $$\nLet's introduce a change of variable $x = \\sqrt{\\lambda} r$. The equation transforms into the standard Bessel's differential equation of order $m$:\n$$ x^2 \\frac{d^2 R}{dx^2} + x \\frac{d R}{dx} + (x^2 - m^2)R = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear combination of the Bessel function of the first kind, $J_m(x)$, and the second kind, $Y_m(x)$. However, the eigenfunction $u$ must be bounded at the origin ($r=0$). Since $Y_m(x)$ is singular at $x=0$, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, the radial part of the solution must be of the form $R(r) = C J_m(\\sqrt{\\lambda} r)$ for some constant $C$.\n\nThe Dirichlet boundary condition requires that $u=0$ on the boundary of the disk, i.e., at $r=r^*$. This implies $R(r^*) = 0$, so we must have:\n$$ J_m(\\sqrt{\\lambda} r^*) = 0 $$\nThis condition can only be satisfied if $\\sqrt{\\lambda} r^*$ is a positive zero of the Bessel function $J_m$. Let $j_{m,k}$ denote the $k$-th positive zero of $J_m(x)$ for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. Then, for each pair $(m, k)$, we have a possible value for $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\lambda_{m,k}} r^* = j_{m,k} $$\nThis gives the spectrum of eigenvalues for the disk $B^*$:\n$$ \\lambda_{m,k} = \\left(\\frac{j_{m,k}}{r^*}\\right)^2 $$\nThe first eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{1}(B^*)$, is the smallest of all these possible values:\n$$ \\lambda_{1}(B^*) = \\min_{m \\ge 0, k \\ge 1} \\lambda_{m,k} = \\min_{m \\ge 0, k \\ge 1} \\left(\\frac{j_{m,k}}{r^*}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{(r^*)^2} \\left( \\min_{m \\ge 0, k \\ge 1} j_{m,k} \\right)^2 $$\nIt is a known property of the zeros of Bessel functions that the smallest positive zero among all $j_{m,k}$ is $j_{0,1}$, the first positive zero of the function $J_0$. The problem statement directs us to use this specific zero. Therefore, the minimum eigenvalue corresponds to the case $m=0$ and $k=1$:\n$$ \\lambda_{1}(B^*) = \\left(\\frac{j_{0,1}}{r^*}\\right)^2 = \\frac{j_{0,1}^2}{(r^*)^2} $$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for the radius $r^*$ in terms of the area $A$. We know $(r^*)^2 = \\frac{A}{\\pi}$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\lambda_1(B^*)$ gives:\n$$ \\lambda_{1}(B^*) = \\frac{j_{0,1}^2}{A/\\pi} = \\frac{\\pi j_{0,1}^2}{A} $$\nThis expression represents the first eigenvalue of the disk of area $A$.

The Steiner symmetrization is performed in the vertical direction. For each fixed $x \\in (0,L)$, the vertical fiber is the set $\\{y : (x,y) \\in \\Omega_{L,b,h}\\}$. This is the union of two intervals, $(0,b) \\cup (h, h+b)$. The one-dimensional Lebesgue measure of this fiber is $b+b=2b$. The symmetrization process replaces this fiber with a single interval of the same measure, centered at $y=0$. This interval is $(-b, b)$. Since this holds for all $x \\in (0,L)$, the symmetrized domain is:\n$$\nS(\\Omega_{L,b,h}) = \\big\\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : 0 < x < L, -b < y < b \\big\\}\n$$\nThis is a single rectangle of width $L$ and height $2b$.

This domain is a rectangle whose dimensions are $L$ and $2b$. The spectrum of the Laplacian on $(0,L) \\times (-b,b)$ is identical to that on $(0,L) \\times (0,2b)$. Using the same formula for rectangular domains with width $L$ and height $2b$, we find the first eigenvalue by setting $n=1$ and $m=1$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}(S(\\Omega_{L,b,h})) = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2b}\\right)^{2} = \\pi^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{L^{2}} + \\frac{1}{4b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the drop in the eigenvalue, $\\Delta\\lambda_{1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda_{1} = \\lambda_{1}(\\Omega_{L,b,h}) - \\lambda_{1}(S(\\Omega_{L,b,h}))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda_{1} = \\pi^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{L^{2}} + \\frac{1}{b^{2}}\\right) - \\pi^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{L^{2}} + \\frac{1}{4b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda_{1} = \\pi^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{L^{2}} + \\frac{1}{b^{2}} - \\frac{1}{L^{2}} - \\frac{1}{4b^{2}}\\right) = \\pi^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{b^{2}} - \\frac{1}{4b^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda_{1} = \\pi^{2}\\left(\\frac{4-1}{4b^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{3\\pi^{2}}{4b^{2}}\n$$\nThis result is independent of both $L$ and $h$. The independence from $L$ is because the symmetrization acts only on the vertical fibers, and the component of the eigenvalue depending on $L$, $(\\pi/L)^{2}$, is common to both $\\lambda_{1}(\\Omega_{L,b,h})$ and $\\lambda_{1}(S(\\Omega_{L,b,h}))$ and thus cancels out.\n\nThis construction illustrates the mechanism behind the Faber-Krahn inequality. The inequality states that among all domains of a given volume, the ball minimizes the first Dirichlet eigenvalue. A crucial part of its proof, established by Pólya and Szegő, is that Steiner symmetrization preserves the volume of a domain but does not increase its first eigenvalue: $\\lambda_{1}(\\Omega) \\ge \\lambda_{1}(S(\\Omega))$. Our calculation provides an explicit example of this principle.\nWe have found that $\\Delta\\lambda_{1} = \\frac{3\\pi^{2}}{4b^{2}}$. Since $b$ is a height, $b>0$, which implies $\\Delta\\lambda_{1} > 0$. Therefore, $\\lambda_{1}(\\Omega_{L,b,h}) > \\lambda_{1}(S(\\Omega_{L,b,h}))$.\nThe symmetrization process \"smoothed\" an irregularity in the domain. The original domain is disconnected, which is a significant form of non-convexity or irregularity. The symmetrization merged the two disconnected rectangles into a single, connected, and more compact rectangle.\nFrom the variational perspective, $\\lambda_1(\\Omega) = \\inf_{u \\in H_0^1(\\Omega), \\|u\\|_{L^2}=1} \\int_\\Omega |\\nabla u|^2 dx$. An eigenfunction for $\\lambda_1(\\Omega_{L,b,h})$ must live entirely in one of the two rectangles, for example $R_1$. To satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions on a rectangle of height $b$, the eigenfunction must oscillate, incurring a certain minimal Dirichlet energy (proportional to $1/b^2$). By symmetrizing, we create a larger, connected domain of height $2b$. The first eigenfunction on this new domain can be \"flatter\" in the vertical direction, as it has twice the distance over which to vary from $0$ to its maximum and back to $0$. This reduces the magnitude of its vertical derivative, thereby lowering the Dirichlet energy integral $\\int |\\nabla u|^2 dx$ and, consequently, lowering the eigenvalue. This process of reducing irregularity (in this case, mending a disconnection) while preserving volume leads to a strict decrease in $\\lambda_{1}$, which is the core mechanism leveraged by the Faber-Krahn inequality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi^{2}}{4b^{2}}}$$", "id": "3035170"}]}
