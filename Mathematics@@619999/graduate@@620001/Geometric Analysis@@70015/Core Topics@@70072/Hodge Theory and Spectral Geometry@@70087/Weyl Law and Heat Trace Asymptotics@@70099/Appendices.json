The heat kernel $H(t,x,y)$ on a general Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is well-approximated by the heat kernel on the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which models the tangent space $T_{x}M$. This approximation is justified by the fact that the principal symbol of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta_{g}$ is given by the squared norm $|\\xi|_{g}^{2}$ on the cotangent fibers, which corresponds to the standard Laplacian on the tangent space in local coordinates.\n\nThe problem provides the Euclidean heat kernel on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ as $K_{t}(x) = (4\\pi t)^{-n/2} \\exp\\!\\left(-|x|^{2}/(4t)\\right)$.

It is a well-posed problem in spectral geometry, free of scientific or logical flaws, and contains all necessary information for its resolution. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the leading Weyl constant $a_n$ for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the $n$-sphere, $S^n$, via two independent methods and a comparison of the results. The asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalue counting function is given as $N(\\Lambda) \\sim a_n \\Lambda^{n/2}$.\n\n**Method 1: Asymptotic Analysis of the Spectrum**\n\nThe first method is a direct calculation starting from the provided spectral data of the operator $-\\Delta$ on $S^n$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_l = l(l+n-1)$ for $l \\in \\mathbb{N}_0 = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$, with corresponding multiplicities\n$$\nm_l = \\frac{(2l+n-1)(l+n-2)!}{l!(n-1)!}.\n$$\nThe eigenvalue counting function $N(\\Lambda)$ is defined as the sum of multiplicities for all eigenvalues less than or equal to $\\Lambda$:\n$$\nN(\\Lambda) = \\sum_{l=0}^{L_{\\max}} m_l,\n$$\nwhere $L_{\\max}$ is the largest integer $l$ such that $\\lambda_l \\leq \\Lambda$. The condition is $l(l+n-1) \\leq \\Lambda$. As $\\Lambda \\to \\infty$, $l$ must also become large. For large $l$, the term $l^2$ dominates, so $l^2 \\approx \\Lambda$, which implies $l \\approx \\Lambda^{1/2}$. Thus, the summation is up to $L_{\\max} \\approx \\Lambda^{1/2}$.\n\nNext, we determine the asymptotic behavior of the multiplicity $m_l$ for large $l$. The expression for $m_l$ can be rewritten as:\n$$\nm_l = \\frac{(2l+n-1)}{(n-1)!} \\cdot \\frac{(l+n-2)!}{l!} = \\frac{(2l+n-1)}{(n-1)!} \\cdot (l+n-2)(l+n-3)\\dots(l+1).\n$$\nThe product $(l+n-2)(l+n-3)\\dots(l+1)$ consists of $n-2$ terms. For large $l$, each term is approximately $l$. The term $(2l+n-1)$ is approximately $2l$. Therefore, the leading-order behavior of $m_l$ is:\n$$\nm_l \\sim \\frac{2l}{(n-1)!} \\cdot l^{n-2} = \\frac{2l^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \\quad \\text{as } l \\to \\infty.\n$$\nTo find the asymptotic behavior of $N(\\Lambda)$, we approximate the sum by an integral. This is justified because for large $\\Lambda$, the summand $m_l$ is a slowly varying function of $l$.\n$$\nN(\\Lambda) = \\sum_{l=0}^{L_{\\max}} m_l \\sim \\int_0^{L_{\\max}} \\frac{2l^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \\, dl.\n$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$\n\\int_0^{L_{\\max}} \\frac{2l^{n-1}}{(n-1)!} \\, dl = \\frac{2}{(n-1)!} \\left[ \\frac{l^n}{n} \\right]_0^{L_{\\max}} = \\frac{2(L_{\\max})^n}{n!}.\n$$\nSubstituting $L_{\\max} \\approx \\Lambda^{1/2}$ into this expression, we obtain the leading asymptotic behavior of $N(\\Lambda)$:\n$$\nN(\\Lambda) \\sim \\frac{2(\\Lambda^{1/2})^n}{n!} = \\frac{2}{n!} \\Lambda^{n/2}.\n$$\nBy comparing this with the required form $N(\\Lambda) \\sim a_n \\Lambda^{n/2}$, we identify the Weyl constant derived from the spectrum as:\n$$\na_n = \\frac{2}{n!}.\n$$\n\n**Method 2: Phase Space Volume Calculation**\n\nThe second method uses the general formula for the leading coefficient in Weyl's law, which relates it to the volume of the appropriate region in the cotangent bundle $T^*S^n$. The constant $a_n$ in the asymptotic formula $N(\\Lambda) \\sim a_n \\Lambda^{n/2}$ is given by\n$$\na_n = \\frac{\\text{Volume of } \\{(x, \\xi) \\in T^*S^n : |\\sigma(-\\Delta)(x, \\xi)| \\leq 1\\}}{(2\\pi)^n},\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma(-\\Delta)$ is the principal symbol of the operator $-\\Delta$. For the Laplace-Beltrami operator, this symbol is given by $\\sigma(-\\Delta)(x,\\xi) = |\\xi|_{g(x)}^2$, where $|\\xi|_{g(x)}$ is the norm on the cotangent fiber $T_x^*S^n$ induced by the Riemannian metric $g$. The condition $|\\sigma(-\\Delta)(x, \\xi)| \\leq 1$ is thus equivalent to $|\\xi|_{g(x)} \\leq 1$.\n\nThe problem asks to compute the constant given by `the Liouville volume of $\\{(x,\\xi) \\in T^{*}S^{n} : |\\xi|_{g(x)} \\leq 1\\}$ divided by $(2\\pi)^{n}`. This set is the unit cotangent bundle of $S^n$. Its volume is calculated by integrating the volume of the unit ball in each cotangent fiber over the base manifold $S^n$:\n$$\n\\text{Volume} = \\int_{S^n} \\left( \\int_{|\\xi|_{g(x)} \\leq 1, \\xi \\in T_x^*S^n} d\\xi \\right) \\, \\mathrm{dvol}_g(x).\n$$\nThe inner integral is the volume of the unit ball in the $n$-dimensional vector space $T_x^*S^n$. This volume is denoted by $\\omega_n$. Since the metric on $S^n$ is homogeneous, this value is independent of the point $x$. Thus, the total volume is:\n$$\n\\text{Volume} = \\omega_n \\int_{S^n} \\, \\mathrm{dvol}_g(x) = \\omega_n \\operatorname{Vol}(S^n).\n$$\nThe Weyl constant is therefore:\n$$\na_n = \\frac{\\omega_n \\operatorname{Vol}(S^n)}{(2\\pi)^n}.\n$$\nWe now substitute the standard formulas for the volume of the unit $n$-ball, $\\omega_n$, and the volume of the unit $n$-sphere, $\\operatorname{Vol}(S^n)$:\n$$\n\\omega_n = \\operatorname{Vol}(B^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n) = \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}.\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Vol}(S^n \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}) = \\frac{2\\pi^{(n+1)/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n+1}{2})}.\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $a_n$:\n$$\na_n = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^n} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^{n/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{2\\pi^{(n+1)/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{n+1}{2})} \\right) = \\frac{2 \\pi^{n/2 + (n+1)/2}}{2^n \\pi^n \\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1) \\Gamma(\\frac{n+1}{2})}.\n$$\nThe powers of $\\pi$ simplify to $\\pi^{n/2 + n/2 + 1/2 - n} = \\pi^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n$$\na_n = \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^n \\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1) \\Gamma(\\frac{n+1}{2})}.\n$$\nUsing the property $\\Gamma(z+1)=z\\Gamma(z)$, we have $\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}+1) = \\frac{n}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})$.\n$$\na_n = \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^n (\\frac{n}{2}\\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2})) \\Gamma(\\frac{n+1}{2})} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}{n 2^{n-1} \\Gamma(\\frac{n}{2}) \\Gamma(\\frac{n+1}{2})}.\n$$\nWe now employ the Legendre duplication formula for the Gamma function: $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(z+1/2) = 2^{1-2z}\\sqrt{\\pi}\\Gamma(2z)$.
