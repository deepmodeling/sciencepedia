Let $\\Omega^p(\\mathbb{T}^n)$ denote the space of smooth $p$-forms on $\\mathbb{T}^n$. The Hodge Laplacian acting on $p$-forms is defined as $\\Delta_p = d\\delta + \\delta d$, where $d$ is the exterior derivative and $\\delta$ is its formal adjoint, the codifferential. A $p$-form $\\omega$ is called harmonic if $\\Delta_p \\omega = 0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the equivalence between harmonic forms and parallel forms on a flat manifold. The fundamental identity relating the Hodge Laplacian to the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$ is the Weitzenböck formula. For any smooth $p$-form $\\omega$, this formula is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta_p \\omega = \\nabla^* \\nabla \\omega + \\mathcal{F}_p(R) \\omega\n$$\nHere, $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection extended to act on the bundle of $p$-forms, $\\nabla^*$ is its formal adjoint with respect to the $L^2$ inner product, and $\\mathcal{F}_p(R)$ is a linear operator constructed from the Riemann curvature tensor $R$. This operator $\\mathcal{F}_p(R)$ acts pointwise on the form $\\omega$.\n\nThe problem states that the torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$ is flat. By definition, a flat Riemannian manifold has a Riemann curvature tensor that is identically zero, i.e., $R \\equiv 0$. Consequently, the curvature term in the Weitzenböck formula vanishes: $\\mathcal{F}_p(R) = 0$. The formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta_p = \\nabla^* \\nabla\n$$\nThis operator $\\nabla^* \\nabla$ is known as the Bochner Laplacian or connection Laplacian. A $p$-form $\\omega$ is harmonic if and only if $\\Delta_p \\omega = 0$, which is now equivalent to $\\nabla^* \\nabla \\omega = 0$.\n\nLet's consider the $L^2$ inner product on the space of smooth $p$-forms, defined as $\\langle\\alpha, \\beta\\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^n} \\langle\\alpha(x), \\beta(x)\\rangle_g \\, dV_g$, where $\\langle\\cdot, \\cdot\\rangle_g$ is the pointwise inner product on $\\Lambda^p T_x^* \\mathbb{T}^n$ induced by the metric $g$, and $dV_g$ is the Riemannian volume form. Since $\\nabla^*$ is the formal adjoint of $\\nabla$, we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta_p \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle \\nabla^* \\nabla \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_{L^2} = \\langle \\nabla \\omega, \\nabla \\omega \\rangle_{L^2}\n$$\nThe right-hand side is the $L^2$-norm squared of the tensor field $\\nabla \\omega$. The integrand $\\langle \\nabla \\omega, \\nabla \\omega \\rangle_g$ is non-negative everywhere. If $\\omega$ is harmonic, then $\\Delta_p \\omega = 0$, which implies $\\langle \\Delta_p \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_{L^2} = 0$. This leads to:\n$$\n\\langle \\nabla \\omega, \\nabla \\omega \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{\\mathbb{T}^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2_g \\, dV_g = 0\n$$\nSince the integrand $|\\nabla \\omega|^2_g$ is a non-negative continuous function, its integral being zero implies that the integrand itself must be identically zero. Therefore, $|\\nabla \\omega|^2_g = 0$ everywhere, which means $\\nabla \\omega = 0$. A form $\\omega$ satisfying $\\nabla \\omega = 0$ is, by definition, a parallel form.\n\nConversely, if $\\omega$ is a parallel form, then $\\nabla \\omega = 0$. Applying the connection Laplacian gives $\\nabla^* \\nabla \\omega = \\nabla^*(0) = 0$. Thus, $\\Delta_p \\omega = 0$, and $\\omega$ is harmonic. This proves that on the flat torus $\\mathbb{T}^n$, the space of harmonic $p$-forms is identical to the space of parallel $p$-forms.\n\nNext, we identify parallel $p$-forms with constant-coefficient $p$-forms. We can view $\\mathbb{T}^n$ as $\\mathbb{R}^n / \\mathbb{Z}^n$ with the standard Euclidean coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$. In these coordinates, the metric tensor components are given by $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$ (the Kronecker delta). Since the components of the metric are constant, all of their partial derivatives are zero. The Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection are given by $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl}(\\partial_i g_{jl} + \\partial_j g_{il} - \\partial_l g_{ij})$. As all partial derivatives of $g_{ij}$ vanish, we have $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all $i,j,k$.\n\nA $p$-form $\\omega$ can be written in these coordinates as:\n$$\n\\omega(x) = \\sum_{1 \\le i_1 < \\dots < i_p \\le n} \\omega_{i_1 \\dots i_p}(x) \\, dx^{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{i_p}\n$$\nThe components of the covariant derivative $\\nabla \\omega$ are given by $(\\nabla_k \\omega)_{i_1 \\dots i_p}$. For a $(0,p)$-tensor like $\\omega$, the general formula is $(\\nabla_k \\omega)_{i_1 \\dots i_p} = \\partial_k \\omega_{i_1 \\dots i_p} - \\sum_{j=1}^p \\Gamma^l_{k i_j} \\omega_{i_1 \\dots l \\dots i_p}$. Since all Christoffel symbols are zero, this simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\nabla_k \\omega)_{i_1 \\dots i_p} = \\partial_k \\omega_{i_1 \\dots i_p}\n$$\nwhere $\\partial_k = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}$.\nThe condition for $\\omega$ to be parallel is $\\nabla \\omega = 0$, which means all components of $\\nabla \\omega$ are zero. This implies $\\partial_k \\omega_{i_1 \\dots i_p} = 0$ for all $k \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ and all multi-indices $(i_1, \\dots, i_p)$. This means each coefficient function $\\omega_{i_1 \\dots i_p}(x)$ must be a constant function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nSince $\\omega$ is a form on the torus, its coefficient functions must be periodic with respect to the lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. A function that is both constant and periodic is simply a constant. Therefore, each coefficient $\\omega_{i_1 \\dots i_p}$ must be a real constant.\nThis establishes that parallel $p$-forms on $\\mathbb{T}^n$ are precisely those $p$-forms whose coefficients are constant in the standard Euclidean coordinates.\n\nTo relate this to Fourier analysis, we note that any smooth function on $\\mathbb{T}^n$, and thus any coefficient function $\\omega_I(x)$ of a $p$-form, can be expanded in a Fourier series. The eigenfunctions of the scalar Laplacian $\\Delta_0 = -\\sum_{j=1}^n \\partial_j^2$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$ are the complex exponentials $f_k(x) = \\exp(2\\pi i k \\cdot x)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^n$. The corresponding eigenvalues are $\\lambda_k = 4\\pi^2 |k|^2 = 4\\pi^2 \\sum_{j=1}^n k_j^2$. The Hodge Laplacian $\\Delta_p$ on $\\mathbb{T}^n$ acts as the scalar Laplacian on each component of the form, i.e., $\\Delta_p (\\sum_I \\omega_I dx^I) = \\sum_I (\\Delta_0 \\omega_I) dx^I$.\nA $p$-form $\\omega$ is harmonic ($\\Delta_p \\omega = 0$) if and only if each of its component functions $\\omega_I$ is harmonic ($\\Delta_0 \\omega_I = 0$). A function is harmonic if and only if it is in the kernel of the Laplacian, which corresponds to the eigenvalue $0$. The eigenvalue $\\lambda_k = 4\\pi^2 |k|^2$ is zero if and only if $k=0$. The eigenfunction for $k=0$ is $f_0(x) = \\exp(0) = 1$, which is a constant function. Therefore, a $p$-form is harmonic if and only if all its coefficient functions are constant. This confirms the previous result.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimension of the kernel of $\\Delta_p$, denoted $\\dim \\ker \\Delta_p$. We have shown that $\\ker \\Delta_p$ is the space of constant-coefficient $p$-forms on $\\mathbb{T}^n$. This vector space is spanned by the basis wedge products $dx^{i_1} \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^{i_p}$ where $1 \\le i_1 < \\dots < i_p \\le n$. The dimension of this space is the number of ways to choose $p$ distinct indices from the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. This is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{p}$.\nThus, the dimension of the space of harmonic $p$-forms on the $n$-torus is:\n$$\n\\dim \\ker \\Delta_p = \\binom{n}{p}\n$$\nThis dimension is also the $p$-th Betti number $b_p(\\mathbb{T}^n)$ of the torus, as predicted by Hodge theory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\binom{n}{p}}$$", "id": "3004130"}, {"introduction": "Having examined the flat case, we now turn to manifolds with positive curvature, exemplified by the round sphere $S^n$.

We are to use a Bochner-Weitzenböck type argument.\n\nA differential $k$-form $\\omega \\in \\Omega^{k}(S^{n})$ is harmonic if it lies in the kernel of the Hodge Laplacian operator $\\Delta = d d^{*} + d^{*} d$. That is, $\\Delta \\omega = 0$. The sphere $S^n$ is a compact, orientable Riemannian manifold, so Hodge theory applies. The dimension of the space of harmonic $k$-forms, denoted $h_k(n) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}^k(S^n)$, is a topological invariant equal to the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold. However, the problem requires a derivation from first principles of differential geometry, not an appeal to algebraic topology.\n\nThe primary tool for this derivation is the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula, which relates the Hodge Laplacian to the connection Laplacian on forms. For a $k$-form $\\omega$ on a general $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, this formula is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega = \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega + \\mathcal{R}(\\omega)\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection extended to the bundle of $k$-forms, $\\nabla^{*} \\nabla$ is the connection Laplacian (or rough Laplacian), and $\\mathcal{R}$ is a linear operator involving the Riemann curvature tensor.

In the case $n=1$, the metric is flat ($K=0$), but the product $k(n-k)$ is zero for $k=0$ or $k=1$, so the formula remains consistent as will be shown. Thus, for any $n \\ge 1$ and $0 \\le k \\le n$, the Bochner-Weitzenböck formula on $S^n$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\omega = \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega + k(n-k) \\omega\n$$\n\nLet $\\omega$ be a harmonic $k$-form on $S^n$. By definition, $\\Delta\\omega = 0$. Substituting this into the formula yields:\n$$\n\\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega + k(n-k) \\omega = 0\n$$\nWe now take the global $L^2$ inner product of this equation with $\\omega$. The $L^2$ inner product is defined as $\\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle_{L^2} = \\int_{S^n} \\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle_x dV_g$, where $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_x$ is the pointwise inner product on forms and $dV_g$ is the volume element.\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} \\langle \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega + k(n-k) \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g = 0\n$$\nBy linearity of the inner product and the integral, this becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} \\langle \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g + \\int_{S^n} k(n-k) \\langle \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g = 0\n$$\nThe operator $\\nabla^*$ is the formal adjoint of $\\nabla$ with respect to the $L^2$ inner product. Since $S^n$ is compact and without boundary, we can integrate by parts:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} \\langle \\nabla^{*} \\nabla \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g = \\int_{S^n} \\langle \\nabla \\omega, \\nabla \\omega \\rangle_x dV_g = \\int_{S^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2 dV_g\n$$\nThe term $\\langle \\omega, \\omega \\rangle_x$ is just the squared pointwise norm of $\\omega$, denoted $|\\omega|^2$. So, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2 dV_g + k(n-k) \\int_{S^n} |\\omega|^2 dV_g = 0\n$$\nWe analyze this equation for different values of $k$.\n\n**Vanishing result for $0 < k < n$**\n\nFor the range $0 < k < n$, both $k$ and $n-k$ are positive integers. Therefore, their product $k(n-k)$ is strictly positive.\nThe integrands $|\\nabla\\omega|^2$ and $|\\omega|^2$ are non-negative. Thus, both integrals are non-negative:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2 dV_g \\ge 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\int_{S^n} |\\omega|^2 dV_g \\ge 0\n$$\nThe equation is a sum of a non-negative term and a strictly positive constant times another non-negative term, which equals zero. This is possible only if both non-negative terms are zero.\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2 dV_g = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\int_{S^n} |\\omega|^2 dV_g = 0\n$$\nThe second condition, $\\int_{S^n} |\\omega|^2 dV_g = 0$, means that the $L^2$ norm of $\\omega$ is zero. Since $\\omega$ is a smooth form, this implies that $\\omega$ must be identically zero everywhere on $S^n$.\nTherefore, for $0 < k < n$, the only harmonic $k$-form is the zero form. The space of harmonic forms $\\mathcal{H}^k(S^n)$ is the trivial vector space $\\{0\\}$. The dimension is $h_k(n) = 0$.\n\n**Harmonic forms for $k=0$ and $k=n$**\n\nFor the boundary cases $k=0$ and $k=n$, the integer factor $k(n-k)$ becomes zero. The integral equation then reduces to:\n$$\n\\int_{S^n} |\\nabla \\omega|^2 dV_g = 0\n$$\nSince the integrand $|\\nabla\\omega|^2$ is non-negative and continuous, the integral can be zero only if the integrand is identically zero everywhere. This means $\\nabla\\omega = 0$. In other words, a form is harmonic if and only if it is a parallel form.\n\n**Case $k=0$:**\nA $0$-form is a function $f \\in C^{\\infty}(S^n)$. The condition $\\nabla f = 0$ is equivalent to the exterior derivative being zero, $df = 0$. This means the function $f$ is locally constant.\nIf $n \\ge 1$, the sphere $S^n$ is a connected manifold. A locally constant function on a connected space must be globally constant. Thus, the harmonic $0$-forms are the constant functions $f(x) = c$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This space is a $1$-dimensional real vector space. So, $h_0(n) = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nIf $n = 0$, $S^0$ is the discrete space consisting of two points $\\{-1, 1\\}$. It is not connected. A locally constant function can take a different constant value on each connected component. Thus, the space of harmonic $0$-forms on $S^0$ is $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and its dimension is $h_0(0) = 2$.\n\n**Case $k=n$:**\nAn $n$-form $\\omega$ on an $n$-dimensional manifold can be written locally as $\\omega = f \\, dV_g$, where $f$ is a function and $dV_g$ is the local volume form. The condition for $\\omega$ being harmonic is that it must be parallel, $\\nabla\\omega = 0$.\nWe use the product rule for the covariant derivative:\n$$\n\\nabla\\omega = \\nabla(f \\, dV_g) = (df) \\otimes dV_g + f (\\nabla dV_g)\n$$\nA fundamental property of the Levi-Civita connection is that it preserves the metric, which implies that the associated volume form is parallel: $\\nabla dV_g = 0$.\nHence, the condition $\\nabla\\omega = 0$ simplifies to $(df) \\otimes dV_g = 0$, which implies $df = 0$.\nAs in the $k=0$ case, this means the function $f$ must be constant on each connected component of $S^n$.\nIf $n \\ge 1$, $S^n$ is connected, so $f$ must be a global constant, $f=c$. The harmonic $n$-forms are the constant multiples of the volume form, $\\omega = c \\, dV_g$. This space is $1$-dimensional. So, $h_n(n) = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nThe case $k=n=0$ is covered by the $k=0$ analysis, which gives $h_0(0)=2$.\n\n**Summary and Final Expression**\nWe have found the following dimensions for the space of harmonic $k$-forms on $S^n$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $h_k(n) = 0$ for $0 < k < n$.\n    \\item $h_0(n) = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$, and $h_0(0) = 2$.\n    \\item $h_n(n) = 1$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\\end{itemize}\nWe can combine these results into a single expression using the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{a,b}$, which is $1$ if $a=b$ and $0$ otherwise.\nFor $n \\ge 1$: $h_k(n) = 1$ if $k=0$ or $k=n$, and $0$ otherwise. This can be written as $\\delta_{k,0} + \\delta_{k,n}$.\nFor $n = 0$: $k$ must be $0$. We have $h_0(0) = 2$. The expression gives $\\delta_{0,0} + \\delta_{0,0} = 1+1=2$.\nThus, the formula $h_k(n) = \\delta_{k,0} + \\delta_{k,n}$ holds for all $n \\ge 0$ and $0 \\le k \\le n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\delta_{k,0} + \\delta_{k,n}}$$", "id": "2978676"}, {"introduction": "Our exploration culminates by venturing beyond compact manifolds to the realm of complete, non-compact spaces, where surprising phenomena can occur.

Its norm-squared is:\n    $$\n    |d\\theta|^2 = g^{\\theta\\theta}(1)(1) = \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(r)}.\n    $$\n\n2.  **Evaluate the integral:**\n    The volume form is $d\\mathrm{vol}_g = \\cosh(r) dr \\wedge d\\theta$. The domain of integration is $F = (0, \\infty) \\times S^1$, so $r \\in (0, \\infty)$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n    The integral is:\n    $$\n    \\int_F |d\\theta|^2 d\\mathrm{vol}_g = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(r)}\\right) \\cosh(r) \\, dr \\, d\\theta.\n    $$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\cdot \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\cosh(r)} dr = 2\\pi \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\cosh(r)} dr.\n    $$\n    To evaluate the remaining integral, we use the substitution $u = e^r$, so $du = e^r dr$, and $dr = du/u$. The limits of integration change from $r=0$ to $u=1$ and $r\\to\\infty$ to $u\\to\\infty$. Also, $\\cosh(r) = \\frac{e^r+e^{-r}}{2} = \\frac{u+1/u}{2}$.\n    $$\n    \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\cosh(r)} dr = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{2}{u+1/u} \\frac{du}{u} = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{2u}{u^2+1} \\frac{du}{u} = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{2}{u^2+1} du.\n    $$\n    This is a standard integral:\n    $$\n    2 [\\arctan(u)]_1^\\infty = 2\\left(\\lim_{u\\to\\infty} \\arctan(u) - \\arctan(1)\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.\n    $$\n    Thus, the total $L^2$ norm-squared is:\n    $$\n    \\int_F |d\\theta|^2 d\\mathrm{vol}_g = 2\\pi \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\pi^2.\n    $$\n    Since the norm is finite ($\\pi^2 < \\infty$), we conclude that $d\\theta \\in \\mathcal{H}^1_{(2)}(F)$.\n\n**Part 3: Structure and Dimension of $\\mathcal{H}^1_{(2)}(M)$**\n\n1.  **Structure of $\\mathcal{H}^1_{(2)}(M)$:**\n    The manifold $M$ is a countable disjoint union $M = \\bigsqcup_{j=1}^{\\infty} F_j$. The space of $1$-forms on $M$, $\\Omega^1(M)$, is the direct sum of the spaces on each component: $\\Omega^1(M) = \\bigoplus_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\Omega^1(F_j)$. An element $\\omega \\in \\Omega^1(M)$ is a sequence $(\\omega_j)_{j=1}^\\infty$ where $\\omega_j \\in \\Omega^1(F_j)$.\n    The Hodge Laplacian $\\Delta_M$ on $M$ acts component-wise: $\\Delta_M \\omega = (\\Delta_{F_j} \\omega_j)$. Therefore, $\\omega$ is harmonic on $M$ if and only if each component $\\omega_j$ is harmonic on $F_j$.\n    The $L^2$ norm on $M$ is given by $\\|\\omega\\|_M^2 = \\int_M |\\omega|^2 d\\mathrm{vol}_g = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\int_{F_j} |\\omega_j|^2 d\\mathrm{vol}_g = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\|\\omega_j\\|_{F_j}^2$.\n    For $\\omega$ to be in $\\mathcal{H}^{1}_{(2)}(M)$, it must be harmonic and have a finite $L^2$ norm. This means that $\\omega = (\\omega_j)$ must satisfy $\\Delta_{F_j} \\omega_j = 0$ for all $j$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\|\\omega_j\\|_{F_j}^2 < \\infty$.\n    This is the definition of a Hilbert direct sum. Therefore, the space of square-integrable harmonic $1$-forms on $M$ is the Hilbert direct sum of the corresponding spaces on each component funnel:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{H}^{1}_{(2)}(M) \\cong \\bigoplus_{j=1}^\\infty \\mathcal{H}^{1}_{(2)}(F_j).\n    $$\n\n2.  **Dimension of $\\mathcal{H}^1_{(2)}(M)$:**\n    From Parts 1 and 2, we established that the form $d\\theta$ on a single funnel $F$ is both harmonic and square-integrable. Since $d\\theta$ is not the zero form, this proves that the space $\\mathcal{H}^1_{(2)}(F)$ is non-trivial, i.e., its dimension is at least $1$. Let $d\\theta_j$ be the corresponding angular $1$-form on the component $F_j$. Each $d\\theta_j$ is a non-zero element of $\\mathcal{H}^1_{(2)}(F_j)$.\n    The dimension of a Hilbert direct sum is the sum of the dimensions of the constituent spaces. Since each $F_j$ is an isometric copy of $F$, they all have the same dimension for their space of $L^2$ harmonic $1$-forms, let's call it $d_F = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}^1_{(2)}(F)) \\geq 1$.\n    The dimension of $\\mathcal{H}^1_{(2)}(M)$ is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\dim(\\mathcal{H}^{1}_{(2)}(M)) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\dim(\\mathcal{H}^1_{(2)}(F_j)) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty d_F.\n    $$\n    Since $d_F$ is a positive integer (in fact, one can show $d_F=2$), this sum is an infinite sum of positive integers, which diverges to infinity.\n    $$\n    \\dim(\\mathcal{H}^{1}_{(2)}(M)) = \\infty.\n    $$\n\n3.  **Geometric Mechanism:** The phenomenon of infinite dimensionality arises from having an infinite number of disjoint components, each contributing to the total space of harmonic forms. The crucial feature is that each component funnel supports *non-trivial square-integrable* harmonic forms. This square-integrability is a direct consequence of the funnel's geometry.\n    The circumference of the circle at a given radius $r$ is $2\\pi\\cosh(r)$, which grows exponentially. The pointwise norm-squared of the angular form $d\\theta$ is $|d\\theta|^2 = 1/\\cosh^2(r)$, which decays exponentially. The volume element over a thin annulus of width $dr$ is approximately $(2\\pi\\cosh(r))dr$. The contribution to the $L^2$ norm integral from this annulus is $|d\\theta|^2 \\times (\\text{volume}) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\cosh^2(r)} \\cdot 2\\pi\\cosh(r)dr = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\cosh(r)}dr$. The term $1/\\cosh(r)$ decays exponentially as $r \\to \\infty$, making its integral over $(0,\\infty)$ converge.\n    In essence, the exponential flare of the funnel's boundary is precisely balanced by the exponential decay of the physical magnitude of the angular covector $d\\theta$, leading to a finite $L^2$ norm. This allows the non-trivial topology of each funnel's \"waist\" (the $S^1$ factor) to be represented by a harmonic form that \"vanishes at infinity\" sufficiently fast to be square-integrable.\n\nThe dimension of $\\mathcal{H}^{1}_{(2)}(M)$ is countably infinite.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\infty}\n$$", "id": "2978665"}]}
