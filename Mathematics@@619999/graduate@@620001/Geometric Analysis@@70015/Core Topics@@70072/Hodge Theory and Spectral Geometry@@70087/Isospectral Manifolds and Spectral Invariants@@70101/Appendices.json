The geodesic curvature $k_{g}$ of a curve in the plane is simply its standard signed curvature $\\kappa$.

Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold on which a finite group $G$ acts by isometries, and let $H$ and $K$ be subgroups of $G$. Sunada's theorem states that if $H$ and $K$ are almost conjugate in $G$, then the quotient manifolds $(M/H, g)$ and $(M/K, g)$ are isospectral.\n\nTwo subgroups $H$ and $K$ of a group $G$ are defined to be almost conjugate (or Gassmann equivalent) if for every conjugacy class $\\mathcal{C}$ in $G$, the equality $\\lvert H \\cap \\mathcal{C} \\rvert = \\lvert K \\cap \\mathcal{C} \\rvert$ holds. This condition is equivalent to the statement that the permutation representations of $G$ acting on the coset spaces $G/H$ and $G/K$ are isomorphic, which in turn is equivalent to the isomorphism of the induced representations $\\operatorname{Ind}_H^G(\\mathbf{1}) \\cong \\operatorname{Ind}_K^G(\\mathbf{1})$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is the trivial representation.\n\nThe spectrum of the Laplace–Beltrami operator on a quotient manifold like $M/H$ is intrinsically linked to the representation theory of the covering group $G$. The heat trace of the Laplacian on the quotient manifold can be expressed as a sum over conjugacy classes of $G$, with each term's coefficient depending on the number of elements from the subgroup ($H$ or $K$) in that conjugacy class. The condition of almost conjugacy, $\\lvert H \\cap \\mathcal{C} \\rvert = \\lvert K \\cap \\mathcal{C} \\rvert$, ensures that these sums are identical for $H$ and $K$.\nSpecifically, the heat trace for the quotient manifold $M/H$ can be shown to be equal to the heat trace for $M/K$ for all $t > 0$. Since the heat trace $\\operatorname{Tr}(\\exp(-t\\Delta))$ uniquely determines the spectrum of the Laplacian $\\Delta$, the equality of heat traces implies the equality of spectra.\n\nIn the problem, we are given a regular covering $p \\colon M \\to \\Sigma_{0}$ with deck group $G$. The group $G$ acts by isometries on $(M, g_{0})$. We are also explicitly given that $H$ and $K$ are almost conjugate subgroups of $G$. Therefore, by Sunada's theorem, the quotient surfaces $(M/H, g_{0})$ and $(M/K, g_{0})$ are isospectral.\n\n**Topological Type:**\nFor closed, orientable surfaces, the topological type is uniquely determined by the genus. We can show that the genera of $M/H$ and $M/K$ are equal by using the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, which relates the geometry (volume, curvature) to the topology (genus).\n\nLet's denote the genus of $M/H$ as $g_H$ and the genus of $M/K$ as $g_K$.\nThe covering map $p \\colon M \\to \\Sigma_{0}$ corresponds to the surjective homomorphism $\\rho \\colon \\pi_{1}(\\Sigma_{0}) \\to G$, whose kernel is $\\pi_{1}(M)$. The deck group of this covering is $G$. Since $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, we have a sequence of covering maps $M \\to M/H \\to \\Sigma_0$. The map $\\pi_H \\colon M/H \\to \\Sigma_0$ is a covering map whose degree is the index $[G:H] = m$. Since the metric $g_0$ on $M/H$ is induced from the metric on $M$, which is lifted from $\\Sigma_0$, the covering map $\\pi_H$ is a local isometry.\nTherefore, the volume of $M/H$ is $m$ times the volume of $\\Sigma_0$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}(M/H, g_0) = \\deg(\\pi_H) \\cdot \\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0) = m \\cdot \\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0) $$\nSimilarly, for the subgroup $K$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}(M/K, g_0) = \\deg(\\pi_K) \\cdot \\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0) = [G:K] \\cdot \\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0) = m \\cdot \\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0) $$\nThus, the two surfaces have the same volume: $\\operatorname{Vol}(M/H, g_0) = \\operatorname{Vol}(M/K, g_0)$.\n\nThe Gauss–Bonnet theorem for a closed orientable surface $S$ of genus $g_S$ with a metric $g$ of constant Gaussian curvature $K_g$ states:\n$$ \\int_S K_g \\, dV_g = 2\\pi\\chi(S) = 2\\pi(2-2g_S) $$\nIn our case, the Gaussian curvature is constant and equal to $-1$. So, for $S=M/H$:\n$$ \\int_{M/H} (-1) \\, dV_{g_0} = -\\operatorname{Vol}(M/H, g_0) = 2\\pi(2 - 2g_H) $$\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}(M/H, g_0) = 4\\pi(g_H - 1) $$\nAnd for $S=M/K$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}(M/K, g_0) = 4\\pi(g_K - 1) $$\nSince we established that $\\operatorname{Vol}(M/H, g_0) = \\operatorname{Vol}(M/K, g_0)$, it follows that:\n$$ 4\\pi(g_H - 1) = 4\\pi(g_K - 1) \\implies g_H = g_K $$\nThe surfaces $M/H$ and $M/K$ have the same genus. As they are both closed and orientable (being quotients of the orientable surface $M$), they share the same topological type.\n\n### Part B: Heat Trace Coefficient\n\nWe are asked to derive the common value of the coefficient of the $t^0$ term in the heat trace expansion for $(M/H, g_0)$ and $(M/K, g_0)$.\nThe given expansion is:\n$$ \\operatorname{Tr}\\left(\\exp(-t\\Delta)\\right) \\sim \\frac{1}{4\\pi t} \\operatorname{Vol}(S,g) + \\frac{1}{6}\\int_{S} R_{g} \\, dV_{g} + O(t) $$\nThe coefficient of the $t^0$ term is $C = \\frac{1}{6}\\int_{S} R_{g} \\, dV_{g}$. Let $S$ represent either $M/H$ or $M/K$.\n\nThe metric $g_0$ on these surfaces has constant Gaussian curvature $K_{g_0} = -1$. For a $2$-dimensional manifold, the scalar curvature $R_g$ is twice the Gaussian curvature $K_g$. Thus:\n$$ R_{g_0} = 2K_{g_0} = 2(-1) = -2 $$\nSubstituting this constant value into the integral for the coefficient $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{6} \\int_{S} (-2) \\, dV_{g_0} = -\\frac{2}{6} \\int_{S} dV_{g_0} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\operatorname{Vol}(S, g_0) $$\nWe need to find the volume of $S$. From Part A, we know this volume is $\\operatorname{Vol}(S, g_0) = m \\cdot \\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0)$. We can calculate $\\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0)$ using the Gauss–Bonnet theorem for $\\Sigma_0$, which is a surface of genus $g_0 \\geq 2$ with constant curvature $-1$.\n$$ \\int_{\\Sigma_0} K_{g_0} \\, dV_{g_0} = 2\\pi\\chi(\\Sigma_0) = 2\\pi(2-2g_0) = 4\\pi(1-g_0) $$\nSince $K_{g_0} = -1$, the integral is $-\\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0)$.\n$$ -\\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0) = 4\\pi(1-g_0) $$\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0) = 4\\pi(g_0-1) $$\nNow we can compute the volume of $S$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Vol}(S, g_0) = m \\cdot \\operatorname{Vol}(\\Sigma_0, g_0) = m \\cdot 4\\pi(g_0-1) $$\nFinally, we substitute this volume into our expression for the coefficient $C$:\n$$ C = -\\frac{1}{3} \\operatorname{Vol}(S, g_0) = -\\frac{1}{3} \\left[ 4\\pi m(g_0-1) \\right] = -\\frac{4\\pi m(g_0-1)}{3} $$\nThis expression depends only on $\\pi$, $m$, and the genus $g_0$, as required.\n\n### Part C: Obstruction to Isospectral Deformations\n\nThe question asks for a mechanism that obstructs nontrivial connected families of pairwise isospectral metrics on a fixed surface $\\Sigma$ of genus $g \\geq 2$. A nontrivial family is a path of metrics $g_s$ for $s \\in [0,1]$ such that $g_s$ and $g_{s'}$ are not isometric for $s \\neq s'$.\n\nA powerful mechanism arises from the relationship between the Laplace spectrum and the length spectrum, combined with geometric rigidity results.\n\n1.  **The Length Spectrum is a Spectral Invariant:**\n    The set of lengths of all closed geodesics on a Riemannian manifold $(\\Sigma, g)$, known as the length spectrum $L(g)$, is determined by the spectrum of the Laplace–Beltrami operator $\\operatorname{spec}(\\Delta_g)$. This is a profound result derived from the analysis of the wave trace, which is the distribution $\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\exp(i\\sqrt{\\lambda_j}t)$. The singularities of this distribution occur at times $t$ equal to the lengths of closed geodesics. Therefore, if a family of metrics $g_s$ is isospectral, i.e., $\\operatorname{spec}(\\Delta_{g_s})$ is constant for all $s \\in [0,1]$, then the length spectrum must also be constant: $L(g_s) = L(g_0)$ for all $s$.\n\n2.  **Length Spectrum Rigidity:**\n    For closed, orientable surfaces $\\Sigma$ of genus $g \\geq 2$, it is a celebrated theorem (due to Otal for negatively curved metrics, and Croke for a more general case) that the length spectrum determines the metric up to isometry. That is, if two metrics $g_1$ and $g_2$ on $\\Sigma$ have the same length spectrum, $L(g_1) = L(g_2)$, then there exists a diffeomorphism $\\phi \\colon \\Sigma \\to \\Sigma$ such that $g_1 = \\phi^{*}g_2$. In other words, $(M, g_1)$ and $(M, g_2)$ are isometric.\n\n**The Obstruction Mechanism:**\nLet $g_s$ for $s \\in [0,1]$ be a continuous path of pairwise isospectral metrics on $\\Sigma$.\nFrom point (1), the fact that they are isospectral implies they all share the same length spectrum: $L(g_s) = L(g_{s'})$ for all $s, s' \\in [0,1]$.\nFrom point (2), the fact that they share the same length spectrum implies that they must all be isometric to each other. For any $s \\in [0,1]$, there exists a diffeomorphism $\\phi_s$ such that $g_s = \\phi_s^* g_0$.\nThis means the entire family of metrics lies within the orbit of a single metric $g_0$ under the action of the diffeomorphism group. Such a family is considered geometrically trivial. If one defines a \"nontrivial\" family as one containing non-isometric metrics, then such families are obstructed. Any attempt to continuously deform a metric in a way that changes its isometry type will necessarily change its length spectrum, and therefore its Laplace spectrum. This provides a strong rigidity against isospectral deformations for surfaces of genus $g \\geq 2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{4\\pi m(g_{0}-1)}{3}}$$", "id": "3031430"}]}
