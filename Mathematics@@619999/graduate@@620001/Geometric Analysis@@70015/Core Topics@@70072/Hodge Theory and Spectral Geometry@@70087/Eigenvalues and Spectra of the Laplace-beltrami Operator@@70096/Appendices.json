We are given the sign convention that $-\\Delta_{S^n}$ is a non-negative operator.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the polar-coordinate identity**\n\nWe work on the manifold $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} \\setminus \\{0\\}$, which is diffeomorphic to $(0, \\infty) \\times S^n$. We use polar coordinates $(r, \\omega)$, where $r \\in (0, \\infty)$ is the radial coordinate and $\\omega \\in S^n$ represents the angular coordinates. Let $\\{\\omega^a\\}_{a=1}^n$ be local coordinates on the sphere $S^n$. The Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is given in these coordinates as $g_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} = \\mathrm{d}r^2 + r^2 g_{S^n}$, where $g_{S^n}$ is the standard round metric on the unit sphere.\n\nLet our full coordinate system be $(x^0, x^1, \\dots, x^n) = (r, \\omega^1, \\dots, \\omega^n)$. The metric tensor $g_{ij}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ in these coordinates is a block-diagonal matrix:\n$$\ng_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & r^2(g_{S^n})_{ab} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, $g_{rr}=1$, $g_{ra}=0$ for $a=1, \\dots, n$, and $g_{ab} = r^2(g_{S^n})_{ab}$ for $a,b=1, \\dots, n$. The inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$ is:\n$$\ng^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & r^{-2}(g_{S^n})^{ab} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of the metric tensor is $|g| = \\det(g_{ij}) = 1 \\cdot \\det(r^2(g_{S^n})_{ab}) = (r^2)^n \\det((g_{S^n})_{ab}) = r^{2n}|g_{S^n}|$.\nThus, the square root of the determinant is $|g|^{1/2} = r^n |g_{S^n}|^{1/2}$.\n\nNow we apply the coordinate formula for the Euclidean Laplacian $\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}$ to a smooth function $u(r, \\omega)$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} u = |g|^{-1/2} \\sum_{i,j} \\partial_i \\left( |g|^{1/2} g^{ij} \\partial_j u \\right)\n$$\nWe split the sum over indices $i,j$ into the radial part ($i=r, j=r$) and the angular parts ($i,j \\in \\{\\omega^1, \\dots, \\omega^n\\}$).\nThe radial term (where $i=r$):\n$$\n|g|^{-1/2} \\partial_r \\left( |g|^{1/2} g^{rr} \\partial_r u \\right) = \\frac{1}{r^n|g_{S^n}|^{1/2}} \\partial_r \\left( r^n |g_{S^n}|^{1/2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\partial_r u \\right)\n$$\nSince $|g_{S^n}|$ depends only on the angular coordinates $\\omega$, it is treated as a constant with respect to $\\partial_r$:\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{r^n} \\partial_r(r^n \\partial_r u) = \\frac{1}{r^n} \\left( n r^{n-1} \\partial_r u + r^n \\partial_{rr} u \\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{n}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}\n$$\nThe angular terms (where $i,j$ are indices for $\\omega^a$):\n$$\n|g|^{-1/2} \\sum_{a,b=1}^n \\partial_a \\left( |g|^{1/2} g^{ab} \\partial_b u \\right) = \\frac{1}{r^n|g_{S^n}|^{1/2}} \\sum_{a,b=1}^n \\partial_a \\left( r^n|g_{S^n}|^{1/2} r^{-2}(g_{S^n})^{ab} \\partial_b u \\right)\n$$\nSince $r$ is independent of the angular coordinates $\\omega^a$, we can factor $r^n$ and $r^{-2}$ out of the $\\partial_a$ derivatives:\n$$\n= \\frac{r^{n-2}}{r^n} \\frac{1}{|g_{S^n}|^{1/2}} \\sum_{a,b=1}^n \\partial_a \\left(|g_{S^n}|^{1/2} (g_{S^n})^{ab} \\partial_b u\\right) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\Delta_{S^n} u\n$$\nCombining the radial and angular parts, we obtain the desired identity:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{n}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\Delta_{S^n}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $-\\Delta_{S^n}$**\n\nLet $p$ be a homogeneous harmonic polynomial on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of degree $l \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$. By definition, this means $\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}p = 0$. The homogeneity of degree $l$ implies that $p(r\\omega) = r^l p(\\omega)$ for $x=r\\omega$ with $|x|=r$ and $\\omega \\in S^n$. Let $Y(\\omega) = p(\\omega)$ be the restriction of $p$ to the unit sphere $S^n$. Thus, we analyze the function $u(r,\\omega) = r^l Y(\\omega)$.\n\nWe apply the identity from Task 1 to $u(r,\\omega)$:\n$\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} u = 0$.\nFirst, we compute the derivatives with respect to $r$:\n$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} = l r^{l-1} Y(\\omega)$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2} = l(l-1) r^{l-2} Y(\\omega)$\nThe action of $\\Delta_{S^n}$ on $u$ is:\n$\\Delta_{S^n} u = \\Delta_{S^n} (r^l Y(\\omega)) = r^l \\Delta_{S^n} Y(\\omega)$, since $\\Delta_{S^n}$ acts only on the angular variables.\n\nSubstituting these into the identity:\n$$\n0 = \\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} (r^l Y(\\omega)) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{n}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\Delta_{S^n} \\right) (r^l Y(\\omega))\n$$\n$$\n0 = l(l-1)r^{l-2}Y(\\omega) + \\frac{n}{r}\\left(l r^{l-1}Y(\\omega)\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\left(r^l \\Delta_{S^n}Y(\\omega)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n0 = l(l-1)r^{l-2}Y(\\omega) + nl r^{l-2}Y(\\omega) + r^{l-2}\\Delta_{S^n}Y(\\omega)\n$$\nWe can factor out $r^{l-2}$ (for $r>0$):\n$$\n0 = [l(l-1) + nl] Y(\\omega) + \\Delta_{S^n}Y(\\omega)\n$$\nThis must hold for all $\\omega \\in S^n$. Since $Y$ is not identically zero (unless $p=0$), it must satisfy the eigenvalue equation:\n$$\n\\Delta_{S^n}Y(\\omega) = - (l(l-1) + nl) Y(\\omega) = -l(l+n-1)Y(\\omega)\n$$\nUsing the specified sign convention, we consider the operator $-\\Delta_{S^n}$:\n$$\n-\\Delta_{S^n}Y(\\omega) = l(l+n-1)Y(\\omega)\n$$\nThis shows that $Y(\\omega)$, the restriction of a homogeneous harmonic polynomial of degree $l$ to $S^n$, is an eigenfunction of $-\\Delta_{S^n}$ with the corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda_l = l(l+n-1)$.\n\n**Task 3: Eigenspaces and the spectrum of $-\\Delta_{S^n}$**\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_l$ denote the space of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree $l$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and let $\\mathcal{Y}_l$ be the space of their restrictions to $S^n$. From Task 2, $\\mathcal{Y}_l$ is an eigenspace of $-\\Delta_{S^n}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_l = l(l+n-1)$.\n\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda_l = l(l+n-1)$ is a strictly increasing function of $l$ for $l \\ge 0$ (assuming $n \\ge 1$). Therefore, for $l \\neq k$, we have $\\lambda_l \\neq \\lambda_k$. The operator $-\\Delta_{S^n}$ is essentially self-adjoint on $L^2(S^n)$. A fundamental property of self-adjoint operators is that eigenspaces corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. Let $Y_l \\in \\mathcal{Y}_l$ and $Y_k \\in \\mathcal{Y}_k$ with $l \\neq k$. Then, using the $L^2(S^n)$ inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\lambda_l \\langle Y_l, Y_k \\rangle = \\langle -\\Delta_{S^n} Y_l, Y_k \\rangle = \\langle Y_l, -\\Delta_{S^n} Y_k \\rangle = \\langle Y_l, \\lambda_k Y_k \\rangle = \\lambda_k \\langle Y_l, Y_k \\rangle\n$$\nThis implies $(\\lambda_l - \\lambda_k) \\langle Y_l, Y_k \\rangle = 0$. Since $\\lambda_l \\neq \\lambda_k$, it must be that $\\langle Y_l, Y_k \\rangle = 0$. Thus, the eigenspaces $\\{\\mathcal{Y}_l\\}_{l=0}^\\infty$ are mutually orthogonal.\n\nTo show that their algebraic direct sum $\\bigoplus_{l=0}^\\infty \\mathcal{Y}_l$ is dense in $L^2(S^n)$, we invoke the theory of polynomial approximation. Any polynomial on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ can be restricted to $S^n$. The set of all such restrictions forms an algebra of functions on $S^n$. By the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, this algebra is dense in the space of continuous functions $C(S^n)$ under the uniform norm. Since $C(S^n)$ is dense in $L^2(S^n)$, the space of polynomial restrictions is dense in $L^2(S^n)$.\n\nIt is a standard result (related to the Fischer decomposition) that any homogeneous polynomial $p_k$ of degree $k$ can be uniquely decomposed as $p_k = \\sum_{j=0}^{\\lfloor k/2 \\rfloor} |x|^{2j} h_{k-2j}$, where $h_{k-2j} \\in \\mathcal{H}_{k-2j}$ is a homogeneous harmonic polynomial of degree $k-2j$. Restricting this to $S^n$ (where $|x|=1$), we get that the restriction of $p_k$ is a sum of functions from $\\mathcal{Y}_{k-2j}$. This shows that the space of all polynomial restrictions to $S^n$ is precisely the algebraic sum $\\bigoplus_{l=0}^\\infty \\mathcal{Y}_l$.\n\nSince we have found a complete orthogonal system of eigenfunctions for $-\\Delta_{S^n}$, the spectrum of $-\\Delta_{S^n}$ consists precisely of the eigenvalues found: $\\sigma(-\\Delta_{S^n}) = \\{\\lambda_l = l(l+n-1) \\mid l \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\}$.\n\n**Task 4: Computation of the multiplicity $m_l$**\n\nThe multiplicity $m_l$ of the eigenvalue $\\lambda_l$ is the dimension of the eigenspace $\\mathcal{Y}_l$. The restriction map from $\\mathcal{H}_l$ to $\\mathcal{Y}_l$ is an isomorphism. To see this, note it is surjective by definition. For injectivity, if $p \\in \\mathcal{H}_l$ has its restriction to $S^n$ being zero, then $p(r\\omega) = r^l p(\\omega) = 0$ for all $r>0, \\omega \\in S^n$. This means $p$ vanishes on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\setminus\\{0\\}$. As a continuous function, $p$ must be zero everywhere. Thus, the map is injective, and $m_l = \\dim \\mathcal{Y}_l = \\dim \\mathcal{H}_l$.\n\nWe compute $\\dim \\mathcal{H}_l$ using a rank-nullity argument. Let $P_k$ be the vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$ in $n+1$ variables. The dimension of $P_k$ is the number of distinct monomials of degree $k$, which is given by the stars-and-bars formula: $\\dim P_k = \\binom{k+(n+1)-1}{(n+1)-1} = \\binom{k+n}{n}$.\n\nThe Euclidean Laplacian $\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}$ is a linear map from $P_l$ to $P_{l-2}$, i.e., $\\Delta: P_l \\to P_{l-2}$. A key result from potential theory asserts that this map is surjective for $l \\ge 2$. The space of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree $l$, $\\mathcal{H}_l$, is precisely the kernel of this map: $\\mathcal{H}_l = \\ker(\\Delta|_{P_l})$.\n\nBy the rank-nullity theorem, for $l \\ge 2$:\n$$\n\\dim P_l = \\dim(\\ker(\\Delta|_{P_l})) + \\dim(\\text{Im}(\\Delta|_{P_l}))\n$$\nUsing $\\dim(\\ker(\\Delta|_{P_l})) = \\dim \\mathcal{H}_l = m_l$ and surjectivity, $\\dim(\\text{Im}(\\Delta|_{P_l})) = \\dim P_{l-2}$, we have:\n$$\n\\dim P_l = m_l + \\dim P_{l-2} \\implies m_l = \\dim P_l - \\dim P_{l-2}\n$$\nSubstituting the formula for the dimensions:\n$$\nm_l = \\binom{l+n}{n} - \\binom{l-2+n}{n}\n$$\nThis formula needs to be checked for $l=0,1$. For $l=0$, $P_0$ are constants. $\\Delta(\\text{const})=0$, so $\\mathcal{H}_0=P_0$ and $m_0=\\dim P_0 = \\binom{n}{n}=1$. For $l=1$, $P_1$ are linear functions. $\\Delta(\\sum c_i x_i)=0$, so $\\mathcal{H}_1=P_1$ and $m_1=\\dim P_1=\\binom{1+n}{n}=n+1$. The formula $m_l = \\dim P_l - \\dim P_{l-2}$ holds for all $l \\ge 0$ if we adopt the convention that $\\dim P_k=0$ for $k < 0$.\n\nWe can simplify the expression for $m_l$:\n$$\nm_l = \\binom{l+n}{n} - \\binom{l+n-2}{n}\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\binom{N}{k} = \\binom{N-1}{k} + \\binom{N-1}{k-1}$, we can write:\n$$\n\\binom{l+n}{n} = \\binom{l+n-1}{n} + \\binom{l+n-1}{n-1}\n$$\nAnd applying it again to the first term:\n$$\n\\binom{l+n-1}{n} = \\binom{l+n-2}{n} + \\binom{l+n-2}{n-1}\n$$\nSubstituting this back gives:\n$$\n\\binom{l+n}{n} = \\binom{l+n-2}{n} + \\binom{l+n-2}{n-1} + \\binom{l+n-1}{n-1}\n$$\nNow, we compute $m_l$:\n$$\nm_l = \\left( \\binom{l+n-2}{n} + \\binom{l+n-2}{n-1} + \\binom{l+n-1}{n-1} \\right) - \\binom{l+n-2}{n}\n$$\n$$\nm_l = \\binom{l+n-1}{n-1} + \\binom{l+n-2}{n-1}\n$$\nThis is a compact and general expression for the multiplicity $m_l$ for all $l \\ge 0$ and $n \\ge 1$ (using the convention $\\binom{a}{b}=0$ if $a<b$). For $l=0$, $m_0 = \\binom{n-1}{n-1} + \\binom{n-2}{n-1} = 1+0=1$. For $l=1$, $m_1 = \\binom{n}{n-1} + \\binom{n-1}{n-1} = n+1$.

We employ spherical coordinates where $x = r\\omega$, with $r = |x| \\in [0, \\infty)$ being the radial coordinate and $\\omega \\in S^{n}$ being the angular coordinate. The Euclidean Laplacian $\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ can be expressed in these coordinates as:\n$$ \\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{n}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\Delta_{S^{n}} $$\nHere, $\\Delta_{S^{n}}$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the unit $n$-sphere $S^{n}$, acting on functions of the angular variable $\\omega$.\n\nWe are given a polynomial $P(x)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that is:\n1.  Homogeneous of degree $k$: $P(tx) = t^k P(x)$ for any scalar $t > 0$. In spherical coordinates, this property implies that $P(r\\omega) = r^k P(1 \\cdot \\omega) = r^k Y(\\omega)$, where $Y(\\omega)$ is the restriction of $P$ to the unit sphere $S^n$ (where $r=1$).\n2.  Harmonic: $\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} P = 0$.\n\nWe seek to show that $Y$ is an eigenfunction of $\\Delta_{S^{n}}$ and to find its eigenvalue. We apply the Laplacian operator to $P(x) = r^k Y(\\omega)$. First, we compute the radial derivatives of $P$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} (r^k Y(\\omega)) = k r^{k-1} Y(\\omega) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial r^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} (r^k Y(\\omega)) = k(k-1) r^{k-2} Y(\\omega) $$\nThe angular part of the Laplacian acts as follows:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\Delta_{S^{n}} (P) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\Delta_{S^{n}} (r^k Y(\\omega)) = \\frac{r^k}{r^2} \\Delta_{S^{n}} Y(\\omega) = r^{k-2} \\Delta_{S^{n}} Y(\\omega) $$\nsince $\\Delta_{S^{n}}$ only operates on the angular variables encapsulated in $\\omega$.\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the harmonic equation $\\Delta_{\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}} P = 0$:\n$$ (k(k-1) r^{k-2} Y(\\omega)) + \\frac{n}{r} (k r^{k-1} Y(\\omega)) + r^{k-2} \\Delta_{S^{n}} Y(\\omega) = 0 $$\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n$$ k(k-1) r^{k-2} Y(\\omega) + nk r^{k-2} Y(\\omega) + r^{k-2} \\Delta_{S^{n}} Y(\\omega) = 0 $$\nFor $r \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by the common factor $r^{k-2}$:\n$$ (k(k-1) + nk) Y(\\omega) + \\Delta_{S^{n}} Y(\\omega) = 0 $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to isolate the action of $\\Delta_{S^{n}}$ on $Y(\\omega)$:\n$$ \\Delta_{S^{n}} Y(\\omega) = -(k(k-1) + nk) Y(\\omega) = -k(k-1+n) Y(\\omega) $$\nThis is an eigenvalue equation of the form $\\Delta_{S^{n}} Y = \\lambda Y$.

The associated eigenvalue, which we denote by $\\lambda_k$, is:\n$$ \\lambda_k = -k(k+n-1) $$\nThis eigenvalue depends on the dimension of the sphere, $n$, and the degree of the polynomial, $k$. Note that the eigenvalues of the (geometer's) Laplacian, $\\Delta$, on a compact manifold without boundary are conventionally non-positive, which is consistent with our result.\n\n**Part 2: Multiplicity of the Eigenvalue for $n=4, k=3$**\n\nThe multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$ is the dimension of its corresponding eigenspace. The theory of spherical harmonics establishes that the space of eigenfunctions on $S^n$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_k$ is isomorphic to the space of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree $k$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $\\mathcal{H}_k(\\mathbb{R}^{m})$ denote the space of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree $k$ in $m$ variables. The multiplicity is therefore $\\dim(\\mathcal{H}_k(\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}))$.\n\nWe need to compute this dimension for the case where the manifold is $S^4$ (so $n=4$) and the degree is $k=3$. The ambient space is $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1} = \\mathbb{R}^5$ (so we use $m=5$).\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P}_k(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ be the vector space of all homogeneous polynomials of degree $k$ in $m$ variables. There is a fundamental direct sum decomposition of this space:\n$$ \\mathcal{P}_k(\\mathbb{R}^m) = \\mathcal{H}_k(\\mathbb{R}^m) \\oplus |x|^2 \\mathcal{P}_{k-2}(\\mathbb{R}^m) $$\nwhere $|x|^2 = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_m^2$. The space $|x|^2 \\mathcal{P}_{k-2}(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ consists of polynomials of degree $k$ that are multiples of $|x|^2$. This decomposition implies a relationship between the dimensions of these spaces:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathcal{P}_k(\\mathbb{R}^m)) = \\dim(\\mathcal{H}_k(\\mathbb{R}^m)) + \\dim(|x|^2 \\mathcal{P}_{k-2}(\\mathbb{R}^m)) $$\nMultiplication by $|x|^2$ is an injective map from $\\mathcal{P}_{k-2}(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ to $\\mathcal{P}_k(\\mathbb{R}^m)$, so $\\dim(|x|^2 \\mathcal{P}_{k-2}(\\mathbb{R}^m)) = \\dim(\\mathcal{P}_{k-2}(\\mathbb{R}^m))$. Therefore, we can find the dimension of the space of harmonic polynomials by subtraction:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathcal{H}_k(\\mathbb{R}^m)) = \\dim(\\mathcal{P}_k(\\mathbb{R}^m)) - \\dim(\\mathcal{P}_{k-2}(\\mathbb{R}^m)) $$\nThe dimension of $\\mathcal{P}_j(\\mathbb{R}^m)$ is the number of distinct monomials of degree $j$ in $m$ variables. This is a standard combinatorial problem, and the solution is given by the \"stars and bars\" formula:\n$$ \\dim(\\mathcal{P}_j(\\mathbb{R}^m)) = \\binom{j+m-1}{j} = \\binom{j+m-1}{m-1} $$\nWe apply this for our specific case: $m=5$ and $k=3$.

Since $-\\Delta$ is a self-adjoint operator, its spectrum $\\sigma(-\\Delta)$ is a subset of the real line. The eigenvalue equation is $-\\Delta f = \\lambda f$ for $f \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{H}^{n})$.\n\n### 1. Separation of Variables\nWe analyze the eigenvalue equation using separation of variables in geodesic polar coordinates $(r, \\omega)$. A function $f \\in L^{2}(\\mathbb{H}^{n})$ can be decomposed into spherical harmonics on $S^{n-1}$. Let $Y_{\\ell,m}(\\omega)$ be the spherical harmonics, which are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on the sphere, $-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}}$:\n$$\n-\\Delta_{S^{n-1}} Y_{\\ell,m} = \\ell(\\ell+n-2) Y_{\\ell,m},\n$$\nwhere $\\ell \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots \\}$ is the degree of the harmonic.\n\nWe seek solutions to $-\\Delta f = \\lambda f$ of the form $f(r,\\omega) = R(r) Y_{\\ell,m}(\\omega)$.

The Hilbert space $L^{2}(\\mathbb{H}^{n})$ decomposes as a direct sum over $\\ell$ and $m$ of radial Hilbert spaces with inner product defined by the volume element $\\mathrm{vol}_{\\mathbb{H}^{n}} = \\sinh^{n-1}(r) dr d\\omega_{S^{n-1}}$. The radial functions lie in $L^{2}([0, \\infty), \\sinh^{n-1}(r)dr)$.\n\n### 2. Reduction to Schrödinger Form\nThe radial ODE contains a first-derivative term. To simplify it to a standard Schrödinger form, we perform a unitary conjugation. Let $\\rho = \\frac{n-1}{2}$. The volume element weight is $\\sinh^{2\\rho}(r)$. We define a unitary map $U: L^{2}([0,\\infty), \\sinh^{2\\rho}(r)dr) \\to L^{2}([0,\\infty), dr)$ by $(UR)(r) = \\sinh^{\\rho}(r)R(r)$.\nLet $\\psi(r) = \\sinh^{\\rho}(r)R(r)$, so $R(r) = \\sinh^{-\\rho}(r)\\psi(r)$. We substitute this into the radial ODE. The derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dr} = \\sinh^{-\\rho}(r)\\frac{d\\psi}{dr} - \\rho\\coth(r)\\sinh^{-\\rho}(r)\\psi(r)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}R}{dr^{2}} = \\sinh^{-\\rho}(r)\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dr^{2}} - 2\\rho\\coth(r)\\sinh^{-\\rho}(r)\\frac{d\\psi}{dr} + (\\rho^{2}\\coth^{2}(r)+\\rho\\mathrm{csch}^{2}(r))\\sinh^{-\\rho}(r)\\psi(r)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the radial equation and noting that $n-1=2\\rho$:\n$$\n-\\left[ \\dots \\right]_{\\psi''} - 2\\rho\\coth(r)\\left[ \\dots \\right]_{\\psi'} + \\left[\\dots\\right]_{\\psi} = \\lambda\\psi\n$$\nAfter careful substitution and cancellation of the first-derivative terms, the equation for $\\psi(r)$ is:\n$$\n-\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dr^{2}} + V_{\\ell}(r) \\psi(r) = \\lambda \\psi(r)\n$$\nThis is a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation, acting on functions in $L^{2}([0,\\infty), dr)$. The potential $V_{\\ell}(r)$ is given by:\n$$\nV_{\\ell}(r) = \\rho^{2}\\coth^{2}(r) - \\rho\\mathrm{csch}^{2}(r) + \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+n-2)}{\\sinh^{2}(r)}\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\coth^{2}(r) = 1 + \\mathrm{csch}^{2}(r)$, we can rewrite the potential as:\n$$\nV_{\\ell}(r) = \\rho^{2}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sinh^{2}(r)}\\right) - \\frac{\\rho}{\\sinh^{2}(r)} + \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+n-2)}{\\sinh^{2}(r)}\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\ell}(r) = \\rho^{2} + \\frac{\\rho^{2}-\\rho + \\ell(\\ell+n-2)}{\\sinh^{2}(r)} = \\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)^{2} + \\frac{\\frac{(n-1)(n-3)}{4} + \\ell(\\ell+n-2)}{\\sinh^{2}(r)}\n$$\nThe asymptotic behavior of the potential as $r \\to \\infty$ is determined by the fact that $\\sinh(r) \\to \\infty$. Consequently, the second term vanishes:\n$$\n\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} V_{\\ell}(r) = \\rho^{2} = \\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n### 3. Essential Spectrum\nFor a one-dimensional Schrödinger operator $-\\frac{d^{2}}{dr^{2}} + V(r)$ on $L^{2}([0,\\infty))$, if the potential $V(r)$ approaches a constant limit $V_{\\infty}$ as $r \\to \\infty$, the essential spectrum is given by the interval $[V_{\\infty}, \\infty)$. In our case, the potential $V_{\\ell}(r)$ satisfies $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} V_{\\ell}(r) = \\rho^{2}$ and the difference $V_{\\ell}(r) - \\rho^{2}$ decays exponentially as $O(\\exp(-2r))$, which is a short-range potential.\nTherefore, for each $\\ell$, the essential spectrum of the radial operator $H_{\\ell} = -\\frac{d^{2}}{dr^{2}} + V_{\\ell}(r)$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{ess}}(H_{\\ell}) = \\left[\\rho^{2}, \\infty\\right) = \\left[\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)^{2}, \\infty\\right)\n$$\nThe bottom edge of the essential spectrum, $\\rho^{2}$, is independent of the spherical harmonic degree $\\ell$.\nThe spectrum of $-\\Delta$ is the closure of the union of the spectra of all the radial operators $H_{\\ell}$:\n$$\n\\sigma(-\\Delta) = \\overline{\\bigcup_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} \\sigma(H_{\\ell})}\n$$\nThe essential spectrum of $-\\Delta$ is the closure of the union of the essential spectra:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{ess}}(-\\Delta) = \\overline{\\bigcup_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} \\sigma_{\\text{ess}}(H_{\\ell})} = \\overline{\\bigcup_{\\ell=0}^{\\infty} \\left[\\rho^{2}, \\infty\\right)} = \\left[\\rho^{2}, \\infty\\right)\n$$\nFurthermore, a fundamental result in geometric analysis (the Donnelly-Xavier-Yau theorem, a consequence of the curvature condition) states that for a complete, non-compact Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded between two negative constants, the Laplacian has no $L^{2}$-eigenvalues. Thus, there is no point spectrum. Combining these facts, the spectrum of $-\\Delta$ is purely continuous and is given by $[\\rho^{2}, \\infty)$.\n\n### 4. Absolute Continuity of the Spectrum\nA more profound understanding of the spectral type comes from the Helgason–Harish-Chandra theory for Riemannian symmetric spaces. Hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$ is a rank-one symmetric space $G/K$, where $G = \\text{SO}_{0}(n,1)$ and $K=\\text{SO}(n)$. The Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ is a $G$-invariant differential operator.\nThe spherical Fourier transform (or Helgason transform) is a unitary map that diagonalizes all $G$-invariant differential operators. For $-\\Delta$, this means:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}(-\\Delta f)(s) = (s^{2}+\\rho^{2})\\mathcal{F}(f)(s)\n$$\nThe Plancherel theorem for $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$ states that the spherical Fourier transform $\\mathcal{F}$ is a unitary isomorphism from $L^{2}(\\mathbb{H}^{n})$ onto the space $L^{2}([0,\\infty), d\\mu(s))$, where $d\\mu(s) = |c(s)|^{-2}ds$ is the Plancherel measure. The function $c(s)$ is the Harish-Chandra $c$-function, and $|c(s)|^{-2}$ is a positive, smooth function on $(0,\\infty)$.\nThis unitary equivalence implies that $-\\Delta$ on $L^{2}(\\mathbb{H}^{n})$ is unitarily equivalent to the multiplication operator $M_{\\lambda(s)}$ on $L^{2}([0,\\infty), d\\mu(s))$ by the function $\\lambda(s) = s^{2} + \\rho^{2}$.\nThe spectrum of a multiplication operator is the essential range of the multiplying function. The spectral parameter $s$ ranges over $[0, \\infty)$. The function $\\lambda(s) = s^{2} + (\\frac{n-1}{2})^{2}$ maps the interval $[0, \\infty)$ to $[\\rho^{2}, \\infty)$.\nThe spectral measure for $-\\Delta$ is therefore supported on $[\\rho^{2}, \\infty)$. Since the Plancherel measure $d\\mu(s)$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure $ds$, the spectrum of $-\\Delta$ is purely absolutely continuous.\n\n### 5. Conclusion on the Spectrum\nFrom the analysis above, we conclude:\n- The spectrum of $-\\Delta$ on $L^{2}(\\mathbb{H}^{n})$ contains no eigenvalues (no point spectrum).\n- The essential spectrum is the interval $[\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)^{2}, \\infty)$.\n- The spectral measure is absolutely continuous.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum of $-\\Delta$ on $L^{2}(\\mathbb{H}^{n})$ is purely absolutely continuous and is given by the interval starting at $\\rho^{2} = ((n-1)/2)^2$ and extending to infinity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left[\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)^{2}, \\infty\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3027886"}]}
