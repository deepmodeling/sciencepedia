A geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v = v^i E_i$ is given by $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_p(tv)$.

Solving this system of equations for $\\partial_k\\partial_l g_{ij}(0)$ by using the symmetries of the Riemann tensor and of the second derivatives yields the result:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g_{ij}}{\\partial x^k \\partial x^l}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\frac{1}{3}\\left(R_{ikjl}(p) + R_{iljk}(p)\\right)\n$$\nThis derivation is lengthy, but a more intuitive approach uses the Jacobi equation. The Jacobi field $J(t)$ along a geodesic $\\gamma(t)=\\exp_p(tv)$ satisfying $J(0)=0, \\dot{J}(0)=w$ has the expansion $J(t) = tw - \\frac{t^3}{6}R(w,v)v + O(t^5)$. The coordinate vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}$ along the geodesic $\\gamma(t)=\\exp_p(tE_k)$ can be shown to be $\\frac{1}{t}J(t)$ where $v=E_k, w=E_j$. Taking inner products $g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j})$ and expanding to second order in $t$ yields the desired result after polarization.\n\n### Final Taylor Polynomial and Coefficient Origin\n\nCombining the terms, the second-order Taylor polynomial for $g_{ij}(x)$ is:\n$$\nT^{(2)} g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} + 0 + \\frac{1}{2} x^k x^l \\left[-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(R_{ikjl}(p) + R_{iljk}(p)\\right)\\right]\n$$\n$$\nT^{(2)} g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{1}{6} \\left(R_{ikjl}(p) + R_{iljk}(p)\\right) x^k x^l\n$$\nBy swapping the dummy summation indices $(k \\leftrightarrow l)$ in the term involving $R_{iljk}$, we see that $\\sum_{k,l} R_{iljk} x^k x^l = \\sum_{k,l} R_{ikjl} x^k x^l$. The expression thus simplifies to:\n$$\nT^{(2)} g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij} - \\frac{1}{3} R_{ikjl}(p) x^k x^l\n$$\n(Here, summation over repeated indices $k$ and $l$ is implied.)\n\nThe numerical coefficient $-\\frac{1}{3}$ originates from the dynamics of geodesic deviation described by the Jacobi equation. The second covariant derivative of a Jacobi field is proportional to the curvature, $\\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma}\\nabla_{\\dot\\gamma} J = -R(J,\\dot\\gamma)\\dot\\gamma$. A Taylor expansion of the solution for a Jacobi field $J(t)$ starting at $p$ gives a term of order $t^3$ involving curvature, specifically $-\\frac{t^3}{6}R(\\dot J(0), \\dot\\gamma(0))\\dot\\gamma(0)$. The coordinate vector fields $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ in normal coordinates are directly related to such Jacobi fields. When computing the metric components $g(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j})$, two such expansions contribute, and the factors combine to yield the final coefficient.

We will proceed to derive the requested properties step-by-step, starting from the fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $\\mathbb{T}^{n} = \\mathbb{R}^{n}/\\Lambda$ be the $n$-torus, where $\\Lambda$ is a full-rank lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The map $\\pi: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\to \\mathbb{T}^{n}$ is the canonical projection, which is a covering map. The space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, \\delta)$ is Euclidean space with the standard metric $\\delta$, whose components in Cartesian coordinates $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$ are given by the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$. The metric $g$ on $\\mathbb{T}^{n}$ is defined to be the metric for which $\\pi$ is a local isometry. This means that for any point $\\bar{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and any tangent vectors $u, v \\in T_{\\bar{q}}\\mathbb{R}^n$, the following relation holds:\n$$g_{\\pi(\\bar{q})}(\\pi_*(u), \\pi_*(v)) = \\delta_{\\bar{q}}(u,v)$$\nwhere $\\pi_*: T\\mathbb{R}^n \\to T\\mathbb{T}^n$ is the differential (or pushforward) of $\\pi$.\n\nSince $\\pi$ is a local diffeomorphism, for any point $q \\in \\mathbb{T}^n$, we can find a neighborhood $U$ of $q$ and an open set $\\tilde{U} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\pi|_{\\tilde{U}}: \\tilde{U} \\to U$ is a diffeomorphism. We can use the standard Cartesian coordinates $(y^1, \\dots, y^n)$ on $\\tilde{U}$ to define a coordinate chart on $U$. In these coordinates, the local isometry condition implies that the components of the metric tensor $g$ on $U$ are identical to the components of $\\delta$ on $\\tilde{U}$. That is, in these local coordinates on $\\mathbb{T}^n$, we have:\n$$g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$$\nA Riemannian manifold that admits local coordinate systems where the metric is constant is called a locally flat manifold.\n\n**1. Geodesics and Levi-Civita Connection**\nThe Levi-Civita connection coefficients (Christoffel symbols of the second kind) are given by the formula:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{kl} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{jl}}{\\partial x^i} + \\frac{\\partial g_{il}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial g_{ij}}{\\partial x^l} \\right)$$\nIn the local coordinates described above, where $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, all partial derivatives of the metric components are zero. Therefore, the Christoffel symbols are identically zero throughout this coordinate patch:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$$\nA geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is a curve that parallel transports its own tangent vector, satisfying the geodesic equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$. In local coordinates, this equation is:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0$$\nSince $\\Gamma^k_{ij}=0$ in our chosen coordinates, the geodesic equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} = 0$$\nThe solutions to this are affine lines in the coordinate space: $x^k(t) = a^k t + b^k$ for constants $a^k, b^k$. Since these coordinates on $\\mathbb{T}^n$ are inherited directly from the Cartesian coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ via the projection $\\pi$, this shows that geodesics in $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g)$ are locally the projections of affine lines in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n**2. Normal Coordinates and Christoffel Symbols at $p$**\nLet's now consider geodesic normal coordinates centered at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{T}^n$. Let $\\{E_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be an orthonormal basis for the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{T}^n$. Normal coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ of a point $q$ near $p$ are defined via the exponential map, such that $q = \\exp_p(v)$, where the vector $v$ has components $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ in the basis $\\{E_i\\}$, i.e., $v = x^i E_i$.\n\nBy definition, the curve $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_p(t v)$ is the geodesic starting at $p$ with initial velocity $v$. In normal coordinates, this geodesic is represented by the straight line $x^i(t) = t v^i$. For this curve, $\\frac{dx^i}{dt} = v^i$ and $\\frac{d^2x^k}{dt^2} = 0$. The geodesic equation must be satisfied for this curve:\n$$0 + \\Gamma^k_{ij}(\\gamma(t)) v^i v^j = 0$$\nThis holds for all $t$ in some interval around $0$ and for all initial velocity vectors $v=(v^1, \\dots, v^n)$. In particular, at $t=0$ (which corresponds to the point $p$), we have:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij}(p) v^i v^j = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic form in $v$ which is identically zero. Since the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices $(\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\Gamma^k_{ji})$, this implies that all components must be zero:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij}(p) = 0$$\nThis is a general property of normal coordinates on any Riemannian manifold.\n\n**3. Parallel Transport and Curvature**\nThe Riemann curvature tensor is defined in terms of the Levi-Civita connection. In a coordinate system, its components are:\n$$R^l_{ijk} = \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ik}}{\\partial x^j} - \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^l_{ij}}{\\partial x^k} + \\Gamma^m_{ik} \\Gamma^l_{mj} - \\Gamma^m_{ij} \\Gamma^l_{mk}$$\nAs we established in the first section, there exists a local coordinate system around any point in $\\mathbb{T}^n$ where $g_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$ and, as a result, $\\Gamma^k_{ij} = 0$ for all indices $i,j,k$ throughout the coordinate domain. In such a coordinate system, all terms in the expression for $R^l_{ijk}$ vanish. The derivatives of the Christoffel symbols are zero because the symbols themselves are zero everywhere in the patch, and the quadratic terms are also zero.\nTherefore, the Riemann curvature tensor is identically zero in these coordinates: $R^l_{ijk} = 0$.\nSince the Riemann curvature is a tensor, if its components are zero in one coordinate system, they are zero in all coordinate systems. Thus, $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g)$ is a flat manifold, meaning its Riemann curvature tensor is zero everywhere.\n\nConsequently, all curvature quantities derived from the Riemann tensor are also zero everywhere.\n- The Ricci tensor, $R_{ij} = R^k_{ikj}$, is zero.\n- The scalar curvature, $S = g^{ij}R_{ij}$, is zero.\nIn particular, all these curvature quantities vanish at the point $p$.\n\nThe equation for parallel transport of a vector field $V$ along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} V = 0$, or in coordinates, $\\frac{dV^k}{dt} + \\Gamma^k_{ij}(\\gamma(t))\\frac{dx^i}{dt}V^j = 0$. In the flat coordinates where $\\Gamma^k_{ij}=0$, this simplifies to $\\frac{dV^k}{dt}=0$. This means the components of a vector remain constant under parallel transport. The result of parallel transport from a point $a$ to a point $b$ only depends on the initial and final points, not on the path taken between them (as long as the path remains within the flat coordinate patch). Since the vector components are constant and the metric components are constant ($g_{ij}=\\delta_{ij}$), the inner product $g(V,W) = g_{ij}V^iW^j = \\delta_{ij}V^iW^j$ is preserved under parallel transport. This allows for the construction of a well-defined geodesic normal frame.\n\n**4. Metric Components in Normal Coordinates**\nFinally, we must show that for this specific manifold, the metric components in normal coordinates are $g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij}$ in a neighborhood of $p$, not just at the point $p$. We use the fact that $\\pi: (\\mathbb{R}^n, \\delta) \\to (\\mathbb{T}^n, g)$ is a covering map and a local isometry. This implies the following diagram commutes for any $\\bar{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and $p = \\pi(\\bar{p})$:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\nT_{\\bar{p}}\\mathbb{R}^n & \\xrightarrow{\\exp_{\\bar{p}}} & \\mathbb{R}^n \\\\\n\\downarrow{\\pi_*} & & \\downarrow{\\pi} \\\\\nT_p\\mathbb{T}^n & \\xrightarrow{\\exp_p} & \\mathbb{T}^n\n\\end{array}\n$$\nLet's choose $\\bar{p}$ to be the origin $0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, so $p=\\pi(0)$. Let $\\{e_i\\}$ be the standard orthonormal basis of $\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong T_0\\mathbb{R}^n$. Let $E_i = \\pi_*(e_i)$ be the corresponding basis in $T_p\\mathbb{T}^n$. Since $\\pi_*$ is an isometry, $\\{E_i\\}$ is an orthonormal basis.\nA point $q$ near $p$ has normal coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ if $q=\\exp_p(x^i E_i)$.\nUsing the diagram, $q = \\exp_p(x^i E_i) = \\exp_p(\\pi_*(x^i e_i)) = \\pi(\\exp_0(x^i e_i))$.\nIn Euclidean space, the exponential map is simply vector addition: $\\exp_0(v) = 0 + v = v$. So, $\\exp_0(x^i e_i)$ is the point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with coordinates $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$.\nTherefore, $q = \\pi(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$.\nThis shows that the normal coordinates of the point $q \\in \\mathbb{T}^n$ are precisely the Cartesian coordinates of its lift in the chosen patch of the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since the metric $g$ in these coordinates inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is $g_{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$, it follows that the metric in normal coordinates centered at $p$ is given by $g_{ij}(x) = \\delta_{ij}$ throughout the normal coordinate neighborhood.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that the manifold $(\\mathbb{T}^n, g)$ is flat, with an identically vanishing Riemann curvature tensor. The scalar curvature $S$ is the trace of the Ricci tensor, which is itself a contraction of the Riemann tensor. As the Riemann tensor is zero everywhere, the scalar curvature is also zero everywhere.

Determine the exact value of the injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$, i.e., the maximal $r>0$ such that $\\exp_{p}$ restricts to a diffeomorphism from $B_{r}(0)\\subset T_{p}M$ onto its image.\n\nProvide your final answer as the value of $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ (a single exact number). No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the geodesic normal coordinate system on the real projective plane $\\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ endowed with its standard metric of constant sectional curvature $1$. We will proceed by lifting the geometry to the universal cover of $\\mathbb{RP}^{2}$, which is the unit $2$-sphere $S^{2}$.\n\nLet $(M,g)$ be $\\mathbb{RP}^{2}$ with the metric of constant sectional curvature $K=1$. $M$ is obtained from the unit sphere $S^{2} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ via the canonical projection $\\pi: S^{2} \\to \\mathbb{RP}^{2}$, which identifies antipodal points $x$ and $-x$. The map $\\pi$ is a $2$-to-$1$ covering map and a local isometry. Let $g_{S^{2}}$ be the standard metric on $S^{2}$. Since $\\pi$ is a local isometry, we have $g = (\\pi^{-1})^{*}g_{S^{2}}$. Geodesics on $(S^{2}, g_{S^{2}})$ are great circles. Because $\\pi$ maps geodesics to geodesics, the geodesics on $(M,g)$ are the projections of great circles.\n\nLet $p \\in M$ be a fixed point. We can choose a point $\\tilde{p} \\in S^{2}$ such that $\\pi(\\tilde{p}) = p$. The fiber over $p$ is then $\\pi^{-1}(p) = \\{\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{p}\\}$. The tangent space $T_pM$ can be identified with $T_{\\tilde{p}}S^{2}$ via the isomorphism $d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}}: T_{\\tilde{p}}S^{2} \\to T_pM$.\nThe Riemannian exponential map $\\exp_{p}: T_{p}M \\to M$ is related to the exponential map on the sphere $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}: T_{\\tilde{p}}S^{2} \\to S^{2}$ by the commutative diagram property: $\\pi \\circ \\exp_{\\tilde{p}} = \\exp_{p} \\circ d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}}$. For a vector $v \\in T_pM$, we denote its unique lift to $T_{\\tilde{p}}S^2$ as $\\tilde{v} = (d\\pi_{\\tilde{p}})^{-1}(v)$. Then $\\exp_p(v) = \\pi(\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}))$.\n\nThe distance between two points $p_1, p_2 \\in M$ is given by $d_M(p_1, p_2) = \\min_{\\tilde{p}_1 \\in \\pi^{-1}(p_1), \\tilde{p}_2 \\in \\pi^{-1}(p_2)} d_{S^2}(\\tilde{p}_1, \\tilde{p}_2)$.\n\n1. The cut locus of $p$.\nThe cut locus $C(p)$ consists of all points $q$ such that either there is more than one minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$, or $q$ is the first conjugate point to $p$ along a geodesic.\n\nLet $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_p(tv)$ be a unit-speed geodesic starting from $p$, where $v \\in T_pM$ is a unit vector. Let $\\tilde{v}$ be the corresponding unit vector in $T_{\\tilde{p}}S^2$. The lift of $\\gamma(t)$ is the great circle arc $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = \\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(t\\tilde{v})$ starting from $\\tilde{p}$. The length of the geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ is $t$. For this segment to be minimizing, its length must equal the distance $d_M(p, \\gamma(t))$.\n\nThe point at time $t$ is $q = \\gamma(t) = \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))$. The fiber over $q$ is $\\pi^{-1}(q) = \\{\\tilde{\\gamma}(t), -\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)\\}$. The distance from $p$ to $q$ is:\n$$d_M(p,q) = \\min(d_{S^2}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)), d_{S^2}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)))$$\nSince $\\tilde{\\gamma}$ is a unit-speed geodesic on $S^2$ starting at $\\tilde{p}$, $d_{S^2}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = t$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$. The distance to the antipode of $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)$ from $\\tilde{p}$ is $d_{S^2}(\\tilde{p}, -\\tilde{\\gamma}(t)) = \\pi - t$. Thus,\n$$d_M(p, \\gamma(t)) = \\min(t, \\pi-t)$$\nThe geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ is minimizing if its length $t$ equals $d_M(p, \\gamma(t))$. This is true if and only if $t \\le \\pi - t$, which implies $2t \\le \\pi$, or $t \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nAt $t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $t = \\pi - t = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. This means there are two distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$ to the point $q = \\gamma(\\frac{\\pi}{2})$, one of length $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, and another one corresponding to the path on $S^2$ from $\\tilde{p}$ to $-\\tilde{\\gamma}(\\frac{\\pi}{2})$, which also has length $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The points $q = \\gamma(t)$ for $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ are the first points along geodesics from $p$ where the minimizing property is lost in terms of uniqueness. These points form the cut locus of $p$.\nThe cut locus of $p$ is therefore the set $C(p) = \\{ \\exp_p(v) \\mid v \\in T_pM, \\|v\\|_g = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\}$. This is a geodesic circle of radius $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ around $p$.\n\nGeodesic normal coordinates fail at the cut locus because the exponential map $\\exp_p$ ceases to be injective. A coordinate chart requires a map to be a diffeomorphism, which must be injective. Let $v \\in T_pM$ with $\\|v\\| = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Then $v$ and $-v$ are distinct points in $T_pM$. Let $\\tilde{v}$ be the lift of $v$. The lift of $-v$ is $-\\tilde{v}$. We compute their images under $\\exp_p$:\n$$\\exp_p(v) = \\pi(\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}))$$\n$$\\exp_p(-v) = \\pi(\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(-\\tilde{v})) = \\pi(-\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}))$$\nOn $S^2$, for a vector $\\tilde{w}$ with norm $\\|\\tilde{w}\\| = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the point $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{w})$ is on the equator relative to the pole $\\tilde{p}$. The point $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(-\\tilde{w})$ is its antipode on the equator. Since $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(-\\tilde{v})=-\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v})$, $\\pi$ maps these two distinct points to the same point in $M$. Therefore, $\\exp_p(v) = \\exp_p(-v)$. This demonstrates the failure of injectivity of $\\exp_p$ on the sphere of radius $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ in $T_pM$.\n\nThe degeneracy of $d\\exp_p$ occurs at conjugate points. As we will show in the next part, the first conjugate point to $p$ along any geodesic occurs at a distance $\\pi$, which is strictly greater than the distance to the cut locus, $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Thus, the failure of normal coordinates at the cut locus is solely due to the loss of global injectivity of $\\exp_p$, not a failure of it being a local diffeomorphism.\n\n2. The radial Jacobian $\\mathcal{J}(r)$.\nIn geodesic normal coordinates $(r, \\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_{n-1})$ on an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the metric tensor takes the form $ds^2 = dr^2 + g_{ij} d\\theta_i d\\theta_j$. The volume element of the induced metric on a sphere of radius $r$ is $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\mathcal{J}(r)$. For a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the radial Jacobian $\\mathcal{J}(r)$ satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$\\mathcal{J}''(r) + K \\mathcal{J}(r) = 0$$\nwith initial conditions $\\mathcal{J}(0) = 0$ and $\\mathcal{J}'(0) = 1$.\nFor $(M,g) = \\mathbb{RP}^2$, we have $K=1$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\mathcal{J}''(r) + \\mathcal{J}(r) = 0$$\nThe general solution is $\\mathcal{J}(r) = A \\cos(r) + B \\sin(r)$.\nApplying the initial conditions:\n$\\mathcal{J}(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A = 0$.\n$\\mathcal{J}'(r) = -A \\sin(r) + B \\cos(r)$, so $\\mathcal{J}'(0) = B \\cos(0) = B = 1$.\nThus, the radial Jacobian is $\\mathcal{J}(r) = \\sin(r)$.\n\nWe are asked for the least $r > 0$ at which $\\mathcal{J}(r)=0$.\n$$\\sin(r) = 0 \\implies r = k\\pi \\text{ for an integer } k.$$\nThe least positive value of $r$ is $\\pi$.\nThis value $r=\\pi$ corresponds to the distance to the first conjugate point along any geodesic from $p$. The point $\\exp_p(\\pi v)$ for a unit vector $v$ is a conjugate point to $p$. Let's check what point this is: $\\exp_p(\\pi v) = \\pi(\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\pi \\tilde{v}))$. On $S^2$, $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\pi \\tilde{v})$ is the antipode $-\\tilde{p}$. So, $\\exp_p(\\pi v) = \\pi(-\\tilde{p}) = p$. The first conjugate point to $p$ along any geodesic is $p$ itself, reached at a distance of $\\pi$.\n\n3. The injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$.\nThe injectivity radius at $p$, denoted $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$, is the supremum of all radii $r > 0$ such that the restriction of the exponential map $\\exp_p$ to the open ball $B_r(0) \\subset T_pM$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image. For this to hold, $\\exp_p$ must be injective on $B_r(0)$ and its differential $d(\\exp_p)_w$ must be non-singular for all $w \\in B_r(0)$.\n\nFrom part 2, the differential $d(\\exp_p)_w$ is singular if and only if $w$ corresponds to a conjugate point. The first conjugate locus is at a distance $\\pi$ from $p$. Thus, $d(\\exp_p)_w$ is non-singular for all $w \\in T_pM$ with $\\|w\\| < \\pi$.\n\nFrom part 1, $\\exp_p$ is not injective on any ball $B_r(0)$ if $r > \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, because such a ball contains vectors $v$ and $-v$ with $\\|v\\| = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, and we showed $\\exp_p(v) = \\exp_p(-v)$.\nFor $r \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, we must check if $\\exp_p$ is injective on the open ball $B_r(0)$. Suppose $\\exp_p(v_1) = \\exp_p(v_2)$ for $v_1, v_2 \\in B_r(0)$. Lifting to $S^2$, we have $\\pi(\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1)) = \\pi(\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_2))$. This implies $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_2) = \\pm \\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1)$.\n- Case 1: $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_2) = \\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1)$. Since the injectivity radius of $S^2$ is $\\pi$ and $\\|v_1\\|, \\|v_2\\| < \\frac{\\pi}{2} < \\pi$, this implies $\\tilde{v}_1 = \\tilde{v}_2$, so $v_1=v_2$.\n- Case 2: $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_2) = -\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1)$. Let $t_1 = \\|\\tilde{v}_1\\|$ and $t_2 = \\|\\tilde{v}_2\\|$. The distance on $S^2$ from $\\tilde{p}$ to $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1)$ is $t_1$, and to $-\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1)$ is $\\pi - t_1$. For $\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_2)$ to be $-\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1)$, the geodesic path to it must have length $t_2$. By the triangle inequality on $S^2$, $d_{S^2}(\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1), -\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1)) \\le d_{S^2}(\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1), \\tilde{p}) + d_{S^2}(\\tilde{p}, -\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1))$. This means $\\pi \\le t_1 + (\\pi-t_1)$, which is always true. The shortest path from $\\tilde{p}$ to $-\\exp_{\\tilde{p}}(\\tilde{v}_1)$ does not necessarily have length $t_2$, unless $\\tilde{v}_2$ is appropriately chosen. However, we have $\\pi \\le t_1+t_2$ by triangle inequality. Since $v_1, v_2 \\in B_r(0)$ with $r \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $t_1 < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $t_2 < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which implies $t_1+t_2 < \\pi$. This contradicts $\\pi \\le t_1+t_2$. Thus, Case 2 is not possible.\n\nSo, $\\exp_p$ is injective on $B_r(0)$ for any $r \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The largest open ball on which $\\exp_p$ is injective is $B_{\\pi/2}(0)$.\nThe injectivity radius is the largest radius $r$ for which $\\exp_p|_{B_r(0)}$ is both injective and a local diffeomorphism. This is the minimum of the distance to the cut locus and the distance to the first conjugate locus.\n$$\\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\min\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\nSince $\\mathbb{RP}^2$ with its standard metric is a homogeneous space, the injectivity radius is the same for all points $p \\in M$.\nThe exact value of the injectivity radius is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$$", "id": "3032531"}]}
