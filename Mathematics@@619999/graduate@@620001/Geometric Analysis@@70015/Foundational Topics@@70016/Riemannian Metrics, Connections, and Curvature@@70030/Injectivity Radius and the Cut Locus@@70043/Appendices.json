We will proceed by first characterizing the geodesics on $S^{n}$, then analyzing when these geodesics cease to be distance-minimizing, which will allow us to identify the cut locus. Finally, we will compute the injectivity radius from the definition as the distance from $p$ to its cut locus.\n\nLet $S^{n} = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : |x|=1\\}$ be the unit sphere. The standard round metric is induced by the Euclidean metric on the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Let $p$ be a fixed point on $S^{n}$. Without loss of generality, we can choose a coordinate system in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ such that $p$ is the \"North Pole\", i.e., $p = (0, 0, \\ldots, 1)$. The tangent space at $p$, $T_{p}S^{n}$, can then be identified with the hyperplane $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1} : x_{n+1}=0\\}$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nA fundamental fact about the round sphere is that its geodesics are great circles, which are the intersections of $S^{n}$ with $2$-dimensional planes passing through the origin of $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. A unit-speed geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ starting at $p$ with an initial velocity vector $u \\in T_{p}S^{n}$ (where $|u|=1$) is parameterized by arc length $t$. Such a geodesic lies in the $2$-plane spanned by the orthogonal vectors $p$ and $u$. Its explicit form is given by:\n$$ \\gamma_{u}(t) = (\\cos t) p + (\\sin t) u $$\nLet's verify this.\n- $\\gamma_{u}(0) = (\\cos 0) p + (\\sin 0) u = p$. The geodesic starts at $p$.\n- The velocity vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}_{u}(t) = -(\\sin t) p + (\\cos t) u$.\n- The initial velocity is $\\dot{\\gamma}_{u}(0) = -(\\sin 0) p + (\\cos 0) u = u$.\n- The speed is $|\\dot{\\gamma}_{u}(t)|^{2} = (-\\sin t)^2 |p|^2 + (\\cos t)^2 |u|^2 - 2 \\sin t \\cos t (p \\cdot u)$. Since $p \\in S^n$ and $u \\in T_pS^n$, we have $|p|=1$, and $p$ is orthogonal to $u$, so $p \\cdot u=0$. As $|u|=1$, the speed squared is $\\sin^2 t + \\cos^2 t = 1$. The geodesic has unit speed.\nThe distance along this geodesic from $p$ to the point $\\gamma_{u}(t)$ is simply the parameter $t$.\n\nThe Riemannian distance $d(x, y)$ between two points $x, y \\in S^{n}$ is the length of the shortest geodesic arc connecting them. This is equal to the central angle, in radians, between the vectors $x$ and $y$. Since $|x|=|y|=1$, this angle is given by $d(x, y) = \\arccos(x \\cdot y)$.\n\nNow, we analyze the condition for a geodesic segment to be minimizing. Let's compare the distance along the geodesic $\\gamma_u(t)$, which is $t$, with the spherical distance $d(p, \\gamma_u(t))$.\n$$ d(p, \\gamma_{u}(t)) = \\arccos(p \\cdot \\gamma_{u}(t)) $$\n$$ p \\cdot \\gamma_{u}(t) = p \\cdot ((\\cos t) p + (\\sin t) u) = \\cos t (p \\cdot p) + \\sin t (p \\cdot u) = (\\cos t)(1) + (\\sin t)(0) = \\cos t $$\nSo, the spherical distance is $d(p, \\gamma_{u}(t)) = \\arccos(\\cos t)$.\n\nWe must carefully evaluate this expression:\n- For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $\\arccos(\\cos t) = t$. In this interval, the distance along the geodesic, $t$, is equal to the shortest distance between its endpoints. Thus, the geodesic segment $\\gamma_{u}|_{[0, t]}$ is a minimizing geodesic for any $t \\in [0, \\pi]$.\n- For $t > \\pi$, let $t = \\pi + \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$. Then $d(p, \\gamma_{u}(t)) = \\arccos(\\cos(\\pi + \\epsilon)) = \\arccos(-\\cos \\epsilon)$. Since $\\epsilon > 0$ and we consider geodesics that are not closed loops, we can assume $t \\in ( \\pi, 2\\pi)$. For this range, $\\arccos(\\cos t) = 2\\pi - t$. Thus, for $t > \\pi$, we have $d(p, \\gamma_{u}(t)) = 2\\pi - t < t$. The distance along the geodesic is no longer the shortest distance between its endpoints.\n\nThis means that along any geodesic $\\gamma_{u}(t)$ starting from $p$, the first point at which it ceases to be distance-minimizing is at parameter value $t=\\pi$. The point itself is:\n$$ q_{\\text{cut}} = \\gamma_{u}(\\pi) = (\\cos \\pi) p + (\\sin \\pi) u = -p $$\nThis point is the antipodal point of $p$. Remarkably, this cut point is independent of the initial direction $u \\in T_{p}S^{n}$. Every geodesic starting at $p$ reaches the same cut point, $-p$, at the same distance $\\pi$.\n\nThe cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}(p)$ is the set of all such first cut points along all geodesics from $p$. Based on the above, $\\operatorname{Cut}(p)$ is contained in the set $\\{-p\\}$.\n\nFurthermore, the cut locus also contains points $q$ for which there exist multiple minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$.\n- Let $q \\in S^{n}$ be a point such that $q \\neq p$ and $q \\neq -p$. The vectors $p$ and $q$ are linearly independent. They uniquely define a $2$-dimensional plane through the origin. The intersection of this plane with $S^{n}$ is a unique great circle passing through $p$ and $q$. This great circle provides two geodesic arcs connecting $p$ and $q$. One has length $\\theta = d(p,q) = \\arccos(p \\cdot q) < \\pi$, and the other has length $2\\pi - \\theta > \\pi$. Thus, there is a unique minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$.\n- Now consider the point $q = -p$. Any great circle passing through $p$ is defined by a $2$-plane spanned by $p$ and some vector $u \\in T_pS^n$. Since $-p$ is in this plane, any such great circle also passes through $-p$. The set of unit initial velocity vectors $u \\in T_pS^n$ forms a sphere $S^{n-1}$. Each choice of $u$ defines a distinct geodesic $\\gamma_u(t)$ that reaches $-p$ at a distance of $\\pi$. All these geodesics are minimizing up to $t=\\pi$. Therefore, there are infinitely many minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $-p$ (if $n \\ge 2$; two if $n=1$), each of length $\\pi$.\n\nBased on both criteria (first point where a geodesic is no longer minimizing, and points with multiple minimizing geodesics), the cut locus of $p$ consists of exactly one point: the antipodal point.\n$$ \\operatorname{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\} $$\n\nThe injectivity radius at a point $p$, denoted $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$, is defined as the distance from $p$ to its cut locus: $\\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, \\operatorname{Cut}(p))$.\nSince $\\operatorname{Cut}(p) = \\{-p\\}$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{inj}(p) = d(p, -p) $$\nThe distance between a point and its antipode on a unit sphere is half the circumference of a great circle. The central angle between $p$ and $-p$ is $\\pi$ radians.\n$$ d(p, -p) = \\arccos(p \\cdot (-p)) = \\arccos(-|p|^2) = \\arccos(-1) = \\pi $$\nTherefore, the injectivity radius at any point $p \\in S^{n}$ is $\\pi$.\n\nThis result can also be understood in terms of the exponential map $\\exp_{p}: T_{p}S^{n} \\to S^{n}$. The injectivity radius $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$ is the supremum of radii $r > 0$ such that $\\exp_{p}$ restricted to the open ball $B_{r}(0) \\subset T_pS^n$ is a diffeomorphism. We found that for any unit vector $u \\in T_pS^n$, the geodesic $\\gamma_u(t)$ is minimizing for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$. The exponential map is given by $\\exp_{p}(v) = \\gamma_{v/|v|}(|v|)$. The map fails to be injective on the sphere of radius $\\pi$ in the tangent space, $\\{v \\in T_pS^n: |v|=\\pi\\}$, because all these vectors are mapped to the single point $-p$. For any two distinct vectors $v_1, v_2$ on this sphere, $\\exp_p(v_1) = \\exp_p(v_2) = -p$. Thus, $\\exp_p$ is not injective on any ball of radius $r > \\pi$. For $r \\in (0, \\pi]$, the map $\\exp_p$ on $B_r(0)$ is injective and an immersion, hence a diffeomorphism onto its image. The largest such radius is $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\pi}$$", "id": "3030938"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the converging geometry of the sphere, we now turn to its counterpart: hyperbolic space, $\\mathbb{H}^n$.

The problem is set within the standard framework of Riemannian geometry and concerns the properties of hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^n$, a canonical example of a complete, simply connected manifold with constant negative sectional curvature. The definitions provided for the exponential map, cut locus, and injectivity radius are standard. The tasks are to deduce well-known properties of $\\mathbb{H}^n$ from fundamental principles, which is a sound and well-posed mathematical exercise. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and internally consistent. We thus deem the problem valid and proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution will be structured in three parts, corresponding to the three claims to be justified, followed by a conclusion for the injectivity radius $\\mathrm{inj}(p)$. The manifold is $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$ with metric $g=y^{-2}(\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\\mathrm{d}x_{i}^{2}+\\mathrm{d}y^{2})$ and constant sectional curvature $K=-1$. The point of interest is $p=(0,\\dots,0,1)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze claim 1 concerning Jacobi fields. Let $\\gamma(t)$ be a unit-speed geodesic in $\\mathbb{H}^{n}$. A Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma(t)$ satisfies the Jacobi equation:\n$$ J''(t) + R(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = 0 $$\nwhere $R$ is the Riemann curvature tensor and the double prime denotes the second covariant derivative along $\\gamma$, i.e., $J'' = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J$. For a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor has the specific form:\n$$ R(X,Y)Z = K(\\langle Y,Z \\rangle_g X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle_g Y) $$\nApplying this to the Jacobi equation with $X=J$ and $Y=Z=\\dot{\\gamma}$, we get:\n$$ R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = K(\\langle \\dot{\\gamma},\\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle J - \\langle J,\\dot{\\gamma} \\rangle \\dot{\\gamma}) $$\nWe are given that $\\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, so $\\langle \\dot{\\gamma}(t),\\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle_g = 1$ for all $t$. We are also considering a Jacobi field $J$ that is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$, so $\\langle J(t),\\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\rangle_g = 0$ for all $t$. Substituting these into the expression for the curvature term gives:\n$$ R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = K(1 \\cdot J - 0 \\cdot \\dot{\\gamma}) = K J $$\nThe Jacobi equation thus simplifies to:\n$$ J'' + K J = 0 $$\nThe problem states that the sectional curvature of $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is $K=-1$. So, the equation for an orthogonal Jacobi field along a geodesic in $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is:\n$$ J''(t) - J(t) = 0 $$\nTo solve this vector differential equation, we can choose a parallel orthonormal frame $\\{E_1(t), \\dots, E_{n-1}(t), E_n(t)=\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\}$ along $\\gamma$. Since $J$ is orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$, we can express it as $J(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i(t) E_i(t)$. Because the frame fields $E_i(t)$ are parallel transported, the covariant derivative simplifies, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i'(t) E_i(t)$ and $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} j_i''(t) E_i(t)$. The vector equation becomes a set of scalar ordinary differential equations for the components $j_i(t)$:\n$$ j_i''(t) - j_i(t) = 0, \\quad i=1, \\dots, n-1 $$\nThe general solution to this equation is $j_i(t) = a_i\\cosh(t) + b_i\\sinh(t)$ for some constants $a_i, b_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We are given the initial condition $J(0) = 0$, which implies $j_i(0)=0$ for all $i$. Evaluating at $t=0$:\n$$ j_i(0) = a_i\\cosh(0) + b_i\\sinh(0) = a_i \\cdot 1 + b_i \\cdot 0 = a_i $$\nThus, the condition $j_i(0)=0$ implies $a_i=0$ for all $i$. The solution for the components is $j_i(t) = b_i\\sinh(t)$. The Jacobi field is therefore:\n$$ J(t) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} b_i E_i(t) \\right) \\sinh(t) $$\nThe initial derivative is $J'(0) = \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} b_i E_i(0)$. For $J$ to be a nontrivial Jacobi field, its initial data $(J(0), J'(0))$ cannot both be zero. Since $J(0)=0$, we must have $J'(0) \\neq 0$, which means at least one $b_i$ is non-zero.\nWe now check if $J(t)$ vanishes for any $t>0$. $J(t)=0$ if and only if $j_i(t)=0$ for all $i$. This means $b_i\\sinh(t)=0$ for all $i$. For any $t>0$, the hyperbolic sine function $\\sinh(t)$ is strictly positive. Therefore, $b_i\\sinh(t)=0$ implies $b_i=0$ for all $i$. This would mean $J'(0)=0$, which contradicts the assumption that $J$ is a nontrivial Jacobi field. Hence, $J(t)$ never vanishes for $t>0$. This justifies claim 1. A direct consequence is that there are no points conjugate to $p$ in $\\mathbb{H}^n$.\n\nSecond, we address claim 2 regarding the uniqueness of geodesics and the cut locus. The cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$ of a point $p$ consists of all points $q$ such that there are at least two distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$, or $q$ is the first conjugate point to $p$ along some geodesic. Based on our analysis for claim 1, there are no conjugate points in $\\mathbb{H}^n$. Therefore, the cut locus, if it exists, must be formed by points $q$ for which there is more than one minimizing geodesic from $p$.\nTo analyze this, we invoke the Cartan-Hadamard theorem. This theorem applies to any complete, simply connected Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature. Let us verify the hypotheses for $\\mathbb{H}^n$.\n1. Completeness: The upper half-space model $\\mathbb{H}^n$ with its standard metric is a complete Riemannian manifold. Any geodesic approaching the boundary $y=0$ has infinite length.\n2. Simple-connectivity: The manifold $\\mathbb{H}^n = \\mathbb{R}^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$, which is simply connected.\n3. Non-positive sectional curvature: The sectional curvature is constant $K=-1$, which is non-positive.\nThe Cartan-Hadamard theorem states that for such a manifold, the exponential map $\\exp_p: T_p\\mathbb{H}^n \\to \\mathbb{H}^n$ is a covering map. Since $\\mathbb{H}^n$ is simply connected, any covering map onto it must be a diffeomorphism. If $\\exp_p$ is a diffeomorphism, then for any point $q \\in \\mathbb{H}^n$, there is a unique vector $v \\in T_p\\mathbb{H}^n$ such that $\\exp_p(v)=q$. The unique geodesic segment from $p$ to $q$ is then given by the curve $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_p(tv/\\|v\\|_p)$ for $t \\in [0, \\|v\\|_p]$, where $\\|v\\|_p$ is the norm in the tangent space $T_p\\mathbb{H}^n$. The length of this path is $\\|v\\|_p$. This geodesic is not only unique but also minimizing. Therefore, for any $q \\in \\mathbb{H}^n \\setminus \\{p\\}$, there exists a unique geodesic segment from $p$ to $q$. This justifies the first part of claim 2.\nSince there are no conjugate points and every pair of points is connected by a unique minimizing geodesic, a geodesic starting at $p$ never ceases to be minimizing. Thus, the cut locus of $p$ is empty: $\\mathrm{Cut}(p) = \\varnothing$. This justifies the second part of claim 2.\n\nThird, we justify claim 3, that $\\exp_p: T_p\\mathbb{H}^n \\to \\mathbb{H}^n$ is a global diffeomorphism. A map is a global diffeomorphism if it is a smooth bijection with a smooth inverse. The exponential map is always smooth. We need to show it is a bijection.\n1. Injectivity: Assume $\\exp_p(v_1) = \\exp_p(v_2) = q$ for some $v_1, v_2 \\in T_p\\mathbb{H}^n$. The curves $\\gamma_1(t) = \\exp_p(t v_1)$ and $\\gamma_2(t) = \\exp_p(t v_2)$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ represent two geodesic paths from $p$ to $q$. As established in our analysis of claim 2, there is only one unique geodesic segment connecting $p$ and $q$. This forces the two paths to be identical, which means their initial tangent vectors must be the same, i.e., $v_1=v_2$. Thus, $\\exp_p$ is injective.\n2. Surjectivity: The Hopf-Rinow theorem states that a complete Riemannian manifold is also geodesically complete, meaning any geodesic can be extended for all time. It also implies that for any two points $p,q$ in the manifold, there exists a length-minimizing geodesic connecting them. This means for any $q \\in \\mathbb{H}^n$, there is a geodesic from $p$ to $q$. Let this geodesic be $\\gamma$. Then there exists a vector $v \\in T_p\\mathbb{H}^n$ such that $\\gamma(t) = \\exp_p(tv)$ and $\\gamma(1)=q$. Hence $\\exp_p(v)=q$. This shows $\\exp_p$ is surjective.\nSince $\\exp_p$ is a smooth bijection, we must check that its inverse is also smooth. A sufficient condition for this is that the differential of $\\exp_p$ is non-singular everywhere. The differential $(d\\exp_p)_v$ fails to be an isomorphism if and only if $\\exp_p(v)$ is a conjugate point to $p$ along the geodesic defined by $v$. From our analysis of claim 1, there are no conjugate points in $\\mathbb{H}^n$. Therefore, $\\exp_p$ is a local diffeomorphism at every point $v \\in T_p\\mathbb{H}^n$. A local diffeomorphism that is also a bijection is a global diffeomorphism. This justifies claim 3.\n\nFinally, we determine the injectivity radius $\\mathrm{inj}(p)$. The injectivity radius at $p$ is defined as $\\mathrm{inj}(p) = \\sup \\{r > 0 \\mid \\exp_p \\text{ is a diffeomorphism on } B_r(0) \\subset T_p\\mathbb{H}^n\\}$, where $B_r(0)$ is the open ball of radius $r$ centered at the origin of the tangent space. Equivalently, the injectivity radius is the distance from $p$ to its cut locus, $\\mathrm{inj}(p) = d(p, \\mathrm{Cut}(p))$.\nOur analysis has shown that the exponential map $\\exp_p: T_p\\mathbb{H}^n \\to \\mathbb{H}^n$ is a global diffeomorphism. This means that its restriction to any open ball $B_r(0)$ for any finite $r>0$ is also a diffeomorphism onto its image. Therefore, the set over which we take the supremum, $\\{r > 0 \\mid \\exp_p|_{B_r(0)} \\text{ is a diffeomorphism} \\}$, is the set of all positive real numbers, $(0, \\infty)$. The supremum of this set is infinity.\nAlternatively, using the relation to the cut locus, we found that $\\mathrm{Cut}(p) = \\varnothing$. The distance from a point to the empty set is conventionally taken to be infinite.

This is mathematically expressed as:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}\\left([x],[y]\\right) = \\inf \\left\\{ \\mathrm{Length}(\\gamma) \\mid \\gamma(0)=x, \\gamma(L) \\in \\{y,-y\\} \\right\\}.\n$$\nThe infimum of lengths of curves between two points is the geodesic distance. Thus, this infimum is the minimum of the distances from $x$ to the points in the set $\\{y,-y\\}$:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}\\left([x],[y]\\right) = \\min\\left\\{ d_{S^{n}}(x,y), d_{S^{n}}(x,-y) \\right\\}.\n$$\nThis establishes the first equality.\n\nFor the second equality, we use the given formula for the spherical distance (Fact (ii)): $d_{S^{n}}(u,v) = \\arccos(\\langle u,v\\rangle)$. Substituting this into our expression for the distance on $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}\\left([x],[y]\\right) = \\min\\left\\{ \\arccos(\\langle x,y\\rangle), \\arccos(\\langle x,-y\\rangle) \\right\\}.\n$$\nUsing the property of the inner product $\\langle x,-y\\rangle = -\\langle x,y\\rangle$, we have:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}\\left([x],[y]\\right) = \\min\\left\\{ \\arccos(\\langle x,y\\rangle), \\arccos(-\\langle x,y\\rangle) \\right\\}.\n$$\nLet $c = \\langle x,y\\rangle$. The value $c$ is in the interval $[-1,1]$. The function $\\arccos(t)$ is monotonically decreasing on its domain $[-1,1]$.\nIf $c \\ge 0$, then $-c \\le 0$. Since $\\arccos$ is decreasing, $\\arccos(c) \\le \\arccos(-c)$. In this case, the minimum is $\\arccos(c)$. Because $c \\ge 0$, we have $c=|\\langle x,y\\rangle|$, so the distance is $\\arccos(|\\langle x,y\\rangle|)$.\nIf $c < 0$, then $-c > 0$. Since $\\arccos$ is decreasing, $\\arccos(c) > \\arccos(-c)$. In this case, the minimum is $\\arccos(-c)$. Because $c < 0$, we have $-c = |\\langle x,y\\rangle|$, so the distance is again $\\arccos(|\\langle x,y\\rangle|)$.\nIn all cases, the distance is given by:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}\\left([x],[y]\\right) = \\arccos\\left(|\\langle x,y\\rangle|\\right).\n$$\nThis completes the proof for Part 1.\n\nPart 2: The cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$.\n\nThe cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$ of a point $p\\in\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is defined as the set of endpoints where length-minimizing geodesics from $p$ cease to be unique. Let $p=[x]$. A minimizing geodesic in $\\mathbb{RP}^{n}$ from $p=[x]$ to $q=[y]$ is the projection of a minimizing geodesic in $S^{n}$ connecting a point in the fiber $\\{x,-x\\}$ to a point in the fiber $\\{y, -y\\}$. The length of such a geodesic is $d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}([x],[y])$.\n\nFrom Part 1, the length of a minimal path is determined by the minimum of two possible path lengths in the covering space $S^n$. A unique minimizing geodesic exists from $[x]$ to $[y]$ if one of these path lengths is strictly smaller than the other. That is, if $d_{S^{n}}(x,y) \\neq d_{S^{n}}(x,-y)$. In this situation, assume without loss of generality that $d_{S^{n}}(x,y)  d_{S^{n}}(x,-y)$. The minimal distance is $d_{S^{n}}(x,y)$, and this must be less than $\\pi/2$. By Fact (iii), there exists a unique minimizing geodesic $\\gamma_{x,y}$ in $S^n$ from $x$ to $y$. The corresponding geodesic in $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is $\\pi \\circ \\gamma_{x,y}$. The only other candidate for a minimizing path lift would be from $-x$ to $-y$, but the geodesic $\\gamma_{-x, -y}$ is just $-\\gamma_{x,y}$, so $\\pi \\circ \\gamma_{-x,-y} = \\pi \\circ \\gamma_{x,y}$. Thus, there is a unique minimizing geodesic in $\\mathbb{RP}^n$.\n\nThe uniqueness of the minimizing geodesic fails precisely when there are two or more distinct lifts that yield minimizing paths. This occurs when the two path lengths in $S^n$ are equal:\n$$\nd_{S^{n}}(x,y) = d_{S^{n}}(x,-y).\n$$\nUsing the distance formula from Fact (ii), this becomes:\n$$\n\\arccos(\\langle x,y\\rangle) = \\arccos(-\\langle x,y\\rangle).\n$$\nSince $\\arccos$ is injective on $[-1,1]$, this implies $\\langle x,y\\rangle = -\\langle x,y\\rangle$, which holds if and only if $\\langle x,y\\rangle=0$.\nThus, a point $q=[y]$ is in the cut locus of $p=[x]$ if and only if its representatives satisfy $\\langle x,y\\rangle=0$. The cut locus is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Cut}(p) = \\left\\{ [y] \\in \\mathbb{RP}^{n} \\mid \\langle x,y\\rangle=0 \\right\\}.\n$$\nThis set is the projective hyperplane consisting of lines in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ orthogonal to the line defined by $x$.\n\nTo confirm there are at least two distinct geodesics in this case, consider when $\\langle x,y \\rangle=0$. The minimal distance is $d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}([x],[y]) = \\arccos(0) = \\pi/2$. In $S^n$, we have two minimizing paths of length $\\pi/2$: one from $x$ to $y$ (let's call it $\\gamma_1$) and one from $x$ to $-y$ (let's call it $\\gamma_2$). Both lengths are less than $\\pi$, so by Fact (iii), $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are unique minimizing geodesics in $S^n$. The projections $\\tilde{\\gamma}_1=\\pi\\circ\\gamma_1$ and $\\tilde{\\gamma}_2=\\pi\\circ\\gamma_2$ are minimizing geodesics in $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ from $[x]$ to $[y]$. Their initial velocity vectors in $T_x S^n$ are $\\dot{\\gamma}_1(0)=y$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_2(0)=-y$. Since $y \\ne -y$, these vectors are distinct. The differential $d\\pi_x: T_x S^n \\to T_{[x]} \\mathbb{RP}^n$ is an isomorphism, so it maps these distinct vectors to distinct initial velocity vectors in $T_{[x]} \\mathbb{RP}^n$. Therefore, $\\tilde{\\gamma}_1$ and $\\tilde{\\gamma}_2$ are distinct geodesics, confirming that points where $\\langle x,y\\rangle=0$ are indeed in the cut locus.\n\nPart 3: The injectivity radius $\\mathrm{inj}(p)$.\n\nThe injectivity radius at a point $p \\in \\mathbb{RP}^n$, denoted $\\mathrm{inj}(p)$, is the distance from $p$ to its cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$. Mathematically,\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(p) = d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}(p, \\mathrm{Cut}(p)) = \\inf_{q \\in \\mathrm{Cut}(p)} d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}(p,q).\n$$\nLet $p=[x]$. From Part 2, any point $q \\in \\mathrm{Cut}(p)$ can be written as $q=[y]$ where $\\langle x,y \\rangle=0$. We can now compute the distance from $p$ to any such point $q$ using the distance formula from Part 1:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}(p,q) = d_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}([x],[y]) = \\arccos(|\\langle x,y\\rangle|).\n$$\nSince $q \\in \\mathrm{Cut}(p)$, we have $\\langle x,y\\rangle = 0$. Substituting this into the distance formula gives:\n$$\nd_{\\mathbb{RP}^{n}}(p,q) = \\arccos(|0|) = \\arccos(0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.\n$$\nThis distance is constant for all points $q$ in the cut locus of $p$. Therefore, the infimum of these distances is also $\\pi/2$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{inj}(p) = \\inf_{q \\in \\mathrm{Cut}(p)} \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}.\n$$\nThe injectivity radius at any point $p\\in\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is $\\pi/2$. This is expected, as $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is a homogeneous space, meaning its geometry is the same at every point. The injectivity radius is half the length of the shortest non-trivial closed geodesic, which in $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ is $\\pi$.\nThe final answer is the value of the injectivity radius in radians.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$$", "id": "3030950"}]}
