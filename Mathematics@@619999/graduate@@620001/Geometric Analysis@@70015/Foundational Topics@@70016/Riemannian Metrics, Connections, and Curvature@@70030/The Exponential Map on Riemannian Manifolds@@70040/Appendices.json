By the definition of this set, there is a unique minimizing geodesic segment from $p$ to $x$. Let this geodesic be $\\gamma_u: [0, L] \\to M$, where $L = d(p,x) = r(x)$ is the length of the segment, and $\\gamma_u$ has unit speed, so $|\\dot{\\gamma}_u(t)|_g = 1$ for all $t \\in [0, L]$.

The fact that $x$ is not in the cut locus $\\mathrm{Cut}(p)$ implies, by definition, that $x$ is not a conjugate point to $p$ along the geodesic $\\gamma_u$.

By the Inverse Function Theorem, the map $\\exp_p$ is a local diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of $v=Lu$ in $T_pM$ to a neighborhood of $x$ in $M$. This means there exists an open neighborhood $U_x$ of $x$ and a smooth inverse map $\\log_p: U_x \\to T_pM$, which is the principal branch of the logarithm map.\n\nFor any point $y \\in U_x$, because $y$ is sufficiently close to $x$ and $x \\notin \\mathrm{Cut}(p)$, the unique minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $y$ is given by $\\exp_p(t \\cdot \\log_p(y) / \\|\\log_p(y)\\|_{g_p})$ for $t \\in [0, d(p,y)]$.

Here, $dr_x(Y)$ is the directional derivative of $r$ at $x$ in the direction $Y$.\nLet $\\gamma_u(t) = \\exp_p(t u)$ be the unique unit-speed minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $x$, with length $L = r(x)$, so $x = \\gamma_u(L)$. We propose that the gradient is the velocity vector of this geodesic at $x$:\n$$\\nabla r(x) = \\dot{\\gamma}_u(L)$$\nTo verify this, we must show that $g_x(\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L), Y) = dr_x(Y)$ for an arbitrary $Y \\in T_xM$.\n\nLet $c(s)$ be any smooth curve in $M$ such that $c(0) = x$ and $\\dot{c}(0) = Y$.

Since we are in the domain where $\\exp_p$ is a local diffeomorphism, we can lift the curve $c(s)$ to the tangent space $T_pM$. Let $V(s) = \\log_p(c(s))$. The path $V(s)$ is a smooth curve in $T_pM$ with $V(0) = \\log_p(x) = Lu$.\nThe distance function is then $r(c(s)) = d(p, c(s)) = \\|V(s)\\|_{g_p}$.

Note that $L(0)=L$ and $u(0)=u$.\nThe derivative we seek is $dr_x(Y) = \\frac{d}{ds}|_{s=0} L(s) = \\dot{L}(0)$.\n\nNow, we analyze the left-hand side of the proposed equality, $g_x(\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L), Y)$.\nThe velocity vector of the geodesic $\\gamma_u(t) = \\exp_p(t u)$ is $\\dot{\\gamma}_u(t) = d(\\exp_p)_{tu}(u)$. At $x=\\gamma_u(L)$, this is $\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L) = d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(u)$.\nThe vector $Y$ is $\\dot{c}(0) = \\frac{d}{ds}|_{s=0} \\exp_p(V(s)) = d(\\exp_p)_{V(0)}(\\dot{V}(0)) = d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(\\dot{V}(0))$.\nThe derivative of $V(s) = L(s) u(s)$ at $s=0$ is $\\dot{V}(0) = \\dot{L}(0)u(0) + L(0)\\dot{u}(0) = \\dot{L}(0)u + L\\dot{u}(0)$.\n\nSo we must compute:\n$$g_x(\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L), Y) = g_x(d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(u), d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(\\dot{L}(0)u + L\\dot{u}(0)))$$\nUsing the bilinearity of the metric $g_x$ and the linearity of the differential $d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}$:\n$$g_x(\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L), Y) = \\dot{L}(0) g_x(d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(u), d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(u)) + L g_x(d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(u), d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(\\dot{u}(0)))$$\nWe now invoke the Gauss Lemma. The vector $u$ is the radial direction at the point $Lu \\in T_pM$. As $u(s)$ is a curve on the unit sphere in $T_pM$, its velocity vector $\\dot{u}(s)$ is always tangent to the sphere. Specifically, differentiating $g_p(u(s),u(s))=1$ gives $2 g_p(\\dot{u}(s), u(s)) = 0$, so $\\dot{u}(s)$ is orthogonal to $u(s)$. Thus, $\\dot{u}(0)$ is orthogonal to $u$. The vector $L\\dot{u}(0)$ is a tangent vector to the sphere of radius $L$ at $Lu$.\nThe Gauss Lemma asserts that the differential of the exponential map sends the radial direction and tangential directions to orthogonal vectors. That is, $g_x(d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(u), d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(w)) = 0$ if $g_p(u, w)=0$. Since $g_p(u, \\dot{u}(0))=0$, the second term in our expression vanishes:\n$$L g_x(d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(u), d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(\\dot{u}(0))) = 0$$\nFor the first term, we recall that $\\gamma_u(t)$ is a unit-speed geodesic. This means its velocity vector has unit length at all times. In particular, $|\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L)|_{g_x} = 1$. This implies:\n$$g_x(d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(u), d(\\exp_p)_{Lu}(u)) = g_x(\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L), \\dot{\\gamma}_u(L)) = |\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L)|_{g_x}^2 = 1^2 = 1$$\nSubstituting these results back, we obtain:\n$$g_x(\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L), Y) = \\dot{L}(0) \\cdot 1 + 0 = \\dot{L}(0)$$\nWe have found that $g_x(\\dot{\\gamma}_u(L), Y) = dr_x(Y)$. Since this holds for any arbitrary vector $Y \\in T_xM$, we have proven by the definition of the gradient that $\\nabla r(x) = \\dot{\\gamma}_u(L) = \\dot{\\gamma}_u(r(x))$.\nThis vector is the unit tangent vector at $x$ to the unique minimizing geodesic starting from $p$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\dot{\\gamma}_{u}(r(x))}$$", "id": "3035018"}]}
