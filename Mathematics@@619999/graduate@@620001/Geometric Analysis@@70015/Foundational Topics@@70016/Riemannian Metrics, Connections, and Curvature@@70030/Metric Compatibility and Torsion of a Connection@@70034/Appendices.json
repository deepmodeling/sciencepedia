All definitions and conditions are standard in the field of differential geometry.\n\nThe first task is to derive the coordinate expression for the autoparallel equation, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma}=0$.\nLet $\\gamma: I \\to M$ be a smooth curve with local coordinate representation $x^{k}(t)$. The velocity vector of the curve is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, which is a vector tangent to the curve at the point $\\gamma(t)$. In the coordinate basis $\\{\\partial_i\\}$, the velocity vector is expressed as $\\dot{\\gamma} = \\frac{dx^i}{dt}\\partial_i = \\dot{x}^i\\partial_i$. Note that the components $\\dot{x}^i$ are functions of the parameter $t$.\n\nThe expression $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma}$ represents the covariant derivative of the vector field $\\dot{\\gamma}$ (which is defined along the curve $\\gamma$) in the direction of $\\dot{\\gamma}$ itself. This is also known as the absolute derivative or covariant derivative along the curve, often denoted $\\frac{D\\dot{\\gamma}}{dt}$.\n\nTo derive its coordinate form, we start with the given expression for the covariant derivative of a general vector field $V=V^j\\partial_j$ defined on an open subset of the manifold:\n$$(\\nabla_{\\partial_{i}}V)^{k}=\\partial_{i}V^{k}+\\Gamma^{k}_{\\ ij}V^{j}$$\nThe operator $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ can be written as $\\nabla_{\\dot{x}^i\\partial_i}$. Using the linearity of the connection in its first argument, we have $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V = \\dot{x}^i \\nabla_{\\partial_i}V$. Therefore, the $k$-th component is:\n$$(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V)^k = \\dot{x}^i (\\nabla_{\\partial_i}V)^k = \\dot{x}^i (\\partial_iV^k + \\Gamma^k_{ij}V^j) = \\dot{x}^i \\partial_iV^k + \\Gamma^k_{ij}\\dot{x}^iV^j$$\nThe term $\\dot{x}^i \\partial_iV^k$ represents the directional derivative of the scalar component function $V^k$ along the direction of the curve's velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}$. By the chain rule, this is precisely the total time derivative of the function $V^k$ evaluated along the curve $\\gamma$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}(V^k(\\gamma(t))) = \\frac{\\partial V^k}{\\partial x^i}\\frac{dx^i}{dt} = (\\partial_iV^k)\\dot{x}^i$$\nSo, the covariant derivative of a vector field $V$ along the curve $\\gamma$ is given in components by:\n$$(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}V)^k = \\frac{d(V^k \\circ \\gamma)}{dt} + \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\dot{x}^i V^j$$\nFor the autoparallel equation, we must compute $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma}$. We set the vector field $V$ to be the velocity field $\\dot{\\gamma}$ itself. The components of $V$ are thus $V^k = \\dot{x}^k(t)$. Substituting this into the formula, we get:\n$$(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma})^k = \\frac{d(\\dot{x}^k)}{dt} + \\Gamma^k_{ij}(\\gamma(t)) \\dot{x}^i \\dot{x}^j$$\nThe term $\\frac{d(\\dot{x}^k)}{dt}$ is the second derivative of the coordinate function $x^k(t)$ with respect to $t$, denoted $\\ddot{x}^k(t)$. Therefore, the $k$-th component of the autoparallel equation $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\dot{\\gamma}=0$ is:\n$$\\ddot{x}^k + \\Gamma^k_{ij}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = 0$$\n\nThe second task is to analyze the contribution of the connection coefficients $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ to this equation and express the effective coefficient in terms of $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ and the torsion tensor $T^k_{ij}$.\nThe term in question is the summation $\\Gamma^k_{ij}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j$. The tensor product of the velocity components, $\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j$, is symmetric with respect to the indices $i$ and $j$, since the components are scalar functions and ordinary multiplication is commutative: $\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = \\dot{x}^j\\dot{x}^i$.\n\nAny rank-2 tensor (like $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ for a fixed $k$) can be decomposed into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts with respect to its covariant indices:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij} = \\Gamma^k_{(ij)} + \\Gamma^k_{[ij]}$$\nwhere the symmetric part is $\\Gamma^k_{(ij)} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Gamma^k_{ij} + \\Gamma^k_{ji})$ and the antisymmetric part is $\\Gamma^k_{[ij]} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Gamma^k_{ij} - \\Gamma^k_{ji})$.\n\nSubstituting this decomposition into the sum:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{ij}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = (\\Gamma^k_{(ij)} + \\Gamma^k_{[ij]})\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = \\Gamma^k_{(ij)}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j + \\Gamma^k_{[ij]}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j$$\nThe contraction of an antisymmetric tensor with a symmetric tensor is zero. We can demonstrate this for the second term:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{[ij]}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = \\Gamma^k_{[ji]}\\dot{x}^j\\dot{x}^i \\quad (\\text{relabeling dummy indices } i \\leftrightarrow j)$$\nUsing the antisymmetry of $\\Gamma^k_{[\\cdot\\cdot]}$ and the symmetry of $\\dot{x}\\otimes\\dot{x}$:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{[ji]}\\dot{x}^j\\dot{x}^i = (-\\Gamma^k_{[ij]})(\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j) = -\\Gamma^k_{[ij]}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j$$\nThus, we have $\\Gamma^k_{[ij]}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = -\\Gamma^k_{[ij]}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j$, which implies $2\\Gamma^k_{[ij]}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = 0$, so $\\Gamma^k_{[ij]}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = 0$.\n\nThis shows that only the symmetric part of the connection coefficients, $\\Gamma^k_{(ij)}$, contributes to the autoparallel equation. The \"effective coefficient\" multiplying $\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j$ is therefore $\\Gamma^k_{(ij)}$.\nThe autoparallel equation can be written as $\\ddot{x}^k + \\Gamma^k_{(ij)}\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j = 0$.\n\nThe final step is to express this effective coefficient, $\\Gamma^k_{(ij)}$, in terms of the full connection coefficient $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ and the torsion tensor $T^k_{ij}$.\nThe coordinate definition of the torsion tensor is given as $T^k_{ij} = \\Gamma^k_{ij} - \\Gamma^k_{ji}$.\nFrom this definition, we can express $\\Gamma^k_{ji}$ as $\\Gamma^k_{ji} = \\Gamma^k_{ij} - T^k_{ij}$.\nNow we substitute this into the definition of the symmetric part $\\Gamma^k_{(ij)}$:\n$$\\Gamma^k_{(ij)} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Gamma^k_{ij} + \\Gamma^k_{ji}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Gamma^k_{ij} + (\\Gamma^k_{ij} - T^k_{ij}))$$\n$$\\Gamma^k_{(ij)} = \\frac{1}{2}(2\\Gamma^k_{ij} - T^k_{ij})$$\n$$\\Gamma^k_{(ij)} = \\Gamma^k_{ij} - \\frac{1}{2}T^k_{ij}$$\nThis is the expression for the effective coefficient that multiplies $\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j$ in the autoparallel equation, expressed purely in terms of the connection coefficients and the torsion tensor.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\Gamma^{k}_{\\ ij} - \\frac{1}{2}T^{k}_{\\ ij}}\n$$", "id": "3032125"}, {"introduction": "The Fundamental Theorem of Riemannian Geometry guarantees that for any metric tensor $g$, there exists a unique connection that is both metric-compatible and torsion-free: the Levi-Civita connection.

Metric compatibility: $Z(g(X,Y)) = g(\\nabla_{Z}X, Y) + g(X, \\nabla_{Z}Y)$\n\nThese two properties lead to the Koszul formula, which provides an explicit expression for the connection in terms of the metric tensor:\n$$\n2g(\\nabla_{X}Y, Z) = X(g(Y,Z)) + Y(g(X,Z)) - Z(g(X,Y)) + g([X,Y],Z) - g([X,Z],Y) - g([Y,Z],X)\n$$\nTo find the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}$, we evaluate this formula in a local coordinate system $(x^1, x^2) = (x, y)$.

This first requires determining the connection coefficients $\\Gamma_{ij}^k$ of the connection $\\nabla$.\n\nFor a metric-compatible connection $\\nabla$, its relation to the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla^g$ associated with the metric $g$ is given by\n$$ \\nabla_X Y = \\nabla^g_X Y + K(X,Y) $$\nwhere $K$ is the contorsion tensor. The contorsion tensor is related to the torsion tensor $T$ by\n$$ g(K(X,Y),Z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( g(T(X,Y),Z) - g(T(Y,Z),X) + g(T(Z,X),Y) \\right) $$\nIn terms of components, this is written as $K_{ij,k} = \\frac{1}{2}(T_{ij,k} - T_{jk,i} + T_{ki,j})$, where $K_{ij,k} = g_{kl}K_{ij}^l$ and $T_{ij,k} = g_{kl}T_{ij}^l$.\n\nThe problem states that in the standard basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ corresponding to coordinates $(x^1, x^2, x^3)$, the torsion $3$-form is $H = h\\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$. The components of $H$ are given by $H_{ijk} = H(e_i, e_j, e_k)$. By definition, we have $T_{ijk} = g(T(e_i,e_j),e_k) = H(e_i,e_j,e_k) = H_{ijk}$. The components of the volume form $dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$ are given by the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk}$.

The order of indices is important: $(\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b})_k = \\sum_{i,j} \\epsilon_{kij} a_i b_j$. Using $\\epsilon_{ijk} = \\epsilon_{kij}$, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{dV^k}{ds} = -\\frac{h}{2} (\\vec{u} \\times \\vec{V})_k $$\nThis can be written as a vector ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{d\\vec{V}}{ds} = -\\frac{h}{2} (\\vec{u} \\times \\vec{V}) $$\nThis is a standard equation for a vector precessing around an axis. We can rewrite it as $\\frac{d\\vec{V}}{ds} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{V}$ with an angular velocity vector $\\vec{\\omega} = \\frac{h}{2}\\vec{u}$. Wait, a sign error. Let's re-verify. $\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = -(\\vec{b} \\times \\vec{a})$. So, $-\\frac{h}{2} (\\vec{u} \\times \\vec{V}) = \\frac{h}{2} (\\vec{V} \\times \\vec{u})$. The equation is $\\frac{d\\vec{V}}{ds} = \\vec{\\omega} \\times \\vec{V}$ where $\\vec{\\omega} = -\\frac{h}{2}\\vec{u}$.\nThe solution to this ODE describes a rotation of the vector $\\vec{V}$ around the axis defined by $\\vec{\\omega}$. Here, the axis is $\\hat{u}$ (or $-\\hat{u}$). The angular velocity of this rotation with respect to the parameter $s$ is constant and is given by the vector $\\vec{\\omega}$.\n\nThe signed magnitude of the angular velocity is $\\omega = -\\frac{h}{2}$, and the axis of rotation is $\\hat{u}$. The total signed angle of rotation $\\theta$ over the arclength $\\ell$ is the integral of the angular speed over the interval $[0,\\ell]$:\n$$ \\theta = \\int_0^\\ell \\omega \\, ds = \\int_0^\\ell \\left(-\\frac{h}{2}\\right) ds = -\\frac{h\\ell}{2} $$\nThe solution $\\vec{V}(s)$ is obtained by rotating the initial vector $\\vec{v} = \\vec{V}(0)$ around the axis $\\hat{u}$ by an angle $\\theta(s) = -\\frac{hs}{2}$. At $s=\\ell$, the final vector is $\\vec{V}(\\ell)$, which is $\\vec{v}$ rotated by the angle $\\theta = -\\frac{h\\ell}{2}$ around $\\hat{u}$.\n\nThe explicit expression for $V(\\ell)$ can be given by Rodrigues' rotation formula:\n$$ V(\\ell) = v \\cos(\\theta) + (\\hat{u} \\times v) \\sin(\\theta) + \\hat{u}(\\hat{u} \\cdot v)(1-\\cos(\\theta)) $$\nwith $\\theta = -\\frac{h\\ell}{2}$. Substituting $\\theta$ gives:\n$$ V(\\ell) = v \\cos\\left(\\frac{h\\ell}{2}\\right) - (\\hat{u} \\times v) \\sin\\left(\\frac{h\\ell}{2}\\right) + \\hat{u}(\\hat{u} \\cdot v)\\left(1-\\cos\\left(\\frac{h\\ell}{2}\\right)\\right) $$\n\nNow we address the specific questions.\nIs the parallel transport an isometry? The map $P_{\\gamma}: v \\mapsto V(\\ell)$ is an isometry if it preserves the norm, i.e., $|V(\\ell)| = |v|$. Let's check the norm of $V(s)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{ds}|\\vec{V}|^2 = \\frac{d}{ds}(\\vec{V} \\cdot \\vec{V}) = 2\\vec{V} \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{V}}{ds} = 2\\vec{V} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{h}{2}(\\vec{u} \\times \\vec{V})\\right) = -h \\vec{V} \\cdot (\\vec{u} \\times \\vec{V}) $$\nThe scalar triple product $\\vec{V} \\cdot (\\vec{u} \\times \\vec{V})$ is zero because the vector $\\vec{u} \\times \\vec{V}$ is orthogonal to $\\vec{V}$. Thus, $\\frac{d}{ds}|\\vec{V}|^2=0$, meaning $|\\vec{V}(s)|$ is constant along the curve. So, $|V(\\ell)| = |V(0)| = |v|$. The parallel transport map is indeed an isometry.\n\nIs it a rotation about the axis $\\hat{u}$? The ODE solution describes a rotation. The axis of rotation is parallel to the vector $\\vec{\\omega} = -\\frac{h}{2}\\hat{u}$. This is the line spanned by $\\hat{u}$. Thus, the parallel transport is a rotation about the axis $\\hat{u}$.\n\nThe final question asks for the signed rotation angle as a function of $h$ and $\\ell$. By convention, a positive angle corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation about the specified axis vector ($\\hat{u}$ in this case). The signed angular velocity about $\\hat{u}$ is $\\omega = -h/2$. The total signed angle for a path of length $\\ell$ is $\\omega\\ell$.\n\nTherefore, the signed rotation angle is $-\\frac{h\\ell}{2}$ radians.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{h\\ell}{2}}$$", "id": "3032133"}]}
