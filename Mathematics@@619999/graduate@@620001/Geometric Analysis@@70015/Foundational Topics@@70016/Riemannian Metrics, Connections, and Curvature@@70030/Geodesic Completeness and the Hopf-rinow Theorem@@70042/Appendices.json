The formula is:\n$$L = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\|\\gamma'(t)\\|_{g(\\gamma(t))} dt$$\nThe curve is given by $\\gamma(t) = t u$, where $u \\in \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is a Euclidean unit vector. The tangent vector is $\\gamma'(t) = u$.\n\nThe metric $g$ is a conformal scaling of the Euclidean metric $g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}$:\n$$g_{x} = e^{-|x|^{2}} g_{\\mathrm{eucl},x}$$\nwhere $|x|$ denotes the standard Euclidean norm of $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$.\n\nThe norm of a tangent vector $v$ at a point $x$ with respect to the metric $g$ is given by:\n$$\\|v\\|_{g_x} = \\sqrt{g_{x}(v,v)} = \\sqrt{e^{-|x|^{2}} g_{\\mathrm{eucl},x}(v,v)} = \\sqrt{e^{-|x|^{2}}} \\|v\\|_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl},x}} = e^{-|x|^{2}/2} \\|v\\|_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl},x}}$$\nTo find the integrand $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|_{g(\\gamma(t))}$, we evaluate this expression at the point $x=\\gamma(t)=t u$ with the tangent vector $v=\\gamma'(t)=u$.\nFirst, the Euclidean norm of the point on the curve is $|\\gamma(t)| = |t u| = |t|\\,\\|u\\|_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}}$. Since $t \\in [0,\\infty)$, $|t|=t$, and since $u$ is a Euclidean unit vector, $\\|u\\|_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}}=1$. Thus, $|\\gamma(t)| = t$.\nThe Euclidean norm of the tangent vector is $\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}} = \\|u\\|_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}} = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the norm:\n$$\\|\\gamma'(t)\\|_{g(\\gamma(t))} = e^{-|\\gamma(t)|^{2}/2} \\|\\gamma'(t)\\|_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}} = e^{-t^{2}/2} \\cdot 1 = e^{-t^{2}/2}$$\nThe total length $L$ is the integral of this quantity from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$:\n$$L = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-t^{2}/2} dt$$\nThe problem asks to express this in terms of the integral $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-t^{2}} dt$. We use a change of variables. Let $s = t/\\sqrt{2}$. Then $t = s\\sqrt{2}$, and the differential is $dt = \\sqrt{2}\\,ds$.

This is the well-known Gaussian integral. We consider its square:\n$$I^{2} = \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x^{2}} dx\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-y^{2}} dy\\right)$$\nUsing Fubini's theorem, we can write this as a double integral over the first quadrant of the Cartesian plane:\n$$I^{2} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-x^{2}} e^{-y^{2}} dx\\,dy = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(x^{2}+y^{2})} dx\\,dy$$\nWe switch to polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, where $x=r\\cos\\theta$ and $y=r\\sin\\theta$. The term $x^{2}+y^{2}$ becomes $r^{2}$, and the area element $dx\\,dy$ becomes $r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$. The integration domain, being the first quadrant, corresponds to $r \\in [0,\\infty)$ and $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$.\n$$I^{2} = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-r^{2}} r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$$\nThis iterated integral is separable:\n$$I^{2} = \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} d\\theta\\right) \\left(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} r e^{-r^{2}} dr\\right)$$\nThe first integral is straightforward:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} d\\theta = [\\theta]_{0}^{\\pi/2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\nFor the second integral, we use the substitution $w=r^{2}$, so $dw = 2r\\,dr$, which gives $r\\,dr = dw/2$. The limits for $w$ are $w(0)=0$ and $w(\\infty)=\\infty$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} r e^{-r^{2}} dr = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-w} \\frac{dw}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[-e^{-w}\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\lim_{w\\to\\infty}(-e^{-w}) - (-e^{0})\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (0 - (-1)) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nCombining these results, we find the value of $I^{2}$:\n$$I^{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$\nSince the integrand $e^{-t^{2}}$ is strictly positive, the integral $I$ must be positive. Therefore, we take the positive square root:\n$$I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-t^{2}} dt = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into our expression for $L$:\n$$L = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot I = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the total length of the ray $\\gamma$.\n\n3) Conclusion about metric completeness using the Hopf–Rinow theorem.\n\nThe Hopf-Rinow theorem states that for a connected Riemannian manifold, metric completeness is equivalent to geodesic completeness. It also states that if a manifold is metrically complete, then any set that is closed and bounded (with respect to the Riemannian distance function) must be compact. We will use this latter property to show that $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$ is not metrically complete.\n\nFirst, the topology induced by the Riemannian metric $g$ is the same as the standard Euclidean topology on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This is because the conformal factor $e^{-|x|^{2}}$ is a continuous, strictly positive function on $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. For any two points, the ratio of their $g$-distance to their Euclidean distance is locally bounded above and below by positive constants, which implies the topologies are identical.\n\nSecond, let's determine if the space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$ is bounded. The distance from the origin $0$ to any point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is denoted by $d_g(0,x)$. This distance is the infimum of the lengths of all paths from $0$ to $x$. We can bound this distance by calculating the length of the straight-line path from $0$ to $x$, given by $\\alpha(t)=tx$ for $t \\in [0,1]$.\nThe length of this path is $L(\\alpha) = \\int_0^1 \\|\\alpha'(t)\\|_g dt$. Here, $\\alpha'(t)=x$ and $|\\alpha(t)|=t|x|$.\n$$\\|\\alpha'(t)\\|_g = e^{-|\\alpha(t)|^{2}/2} \\|\\alpha'(t)\\|_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}} = e^{-(t|x|)^{2}/2} \\|x\\|_{g_{\\mathrm{eucl}}} = |x|e^{-t^2|x|^2/2}$$\nSo, $d_g(0,x) \\le L(\\alpha) = \\int_0^1 |x|e^{-t^2|x|^2/2} dt$. Let $s=t|x|$, so $ds=|x|dt$.\n$$d_g(0,x) \\le \\int_0^{|x|} e^{-s^2/2} ds$$\nAs $|x| \\to \\infty$, this upper bound approaches the finite value $L$ that we calculated:\n$$\\lim_{|x|\\to\\infty} \\int_0^{|x|} e^{-s^2/2} ds = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-s^2/2} ds = L = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$$\nThis shows that the distance from the origin to any point in the manifold is bounded by $L$. By the triangle inequality, the distance between any two points $p, q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is bounded: $d_g(p,q) \\le d_g(p,0) + d_g(0,q)  2L = \\sqrt{2\\pi}$. Therefore, the metric space $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$ is bounded.\n\nNow we invoke the Hopf-Rinow theorem. The set $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is trivially a closed subset of itself. We have shown it is a bounded set with respect to the metric $g$. If $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$ were metrically complete, the Hopf-Rinow theorem would imply that $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a compact space. However, $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with its standard topology (which we established is the one induced by $g$) is not compact for any $n \\ge 1$. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^{n}, g)$ cannot be metrically complete. The finiteness of the length $L$ of the infinite ray $\\gamma$ is the direct cause of the space being bounded, which leads to this conclusion. The curve $\\gamma$ allows one to \"travel to infinity\" (in the Euclidean sense) in finite \"g-distance,\" which is characteristic of an incomplete space. More directly, the sequence of points $\\gamma(k)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g)$ that does not converge to any point in the manifold, proving incompleteness by definition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}}$$", "id": "3028628"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how a topologically unbounded space can be metrically incomplete, we now investigate the opposite situation: a space with a clear boundary that is, in fact, complete.

However, the Riemannian distance to this boundary is infinite.\n\nTo compute the arc-length $L(y; y_0)$ of a vertical geodesic segment, let the path be $\\gamma$ joining $(x_0, y_0)$ to $(x_0, y)$.

Since length must be positive, we take the absolute value.\n$$\nL(y; y_0) = \\left| \\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{y_0}\\right) \\right|\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nThis calculation informs the question of geodesic completeness. A Riemannian manifold is geodesically complete if every geodesic can be extended for all values of its parameter $t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. Consider a unit-speed geodesic moving along a vertical line towards the boundary $y=0$. For a unit-speed parameterization $t$, the arc-length is simply the elapsed parameter time. The arc-length from any point $(x_0, y_0)$ with $y_00$ to a point $(x_0, \\epsilon)$ with $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$ is $L = |\\ln(\\epsilon/y_0)| = \\ln(y_0/\\epsilon)$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, $L \\to \\infty$. This implies that the boundary $\\{y=0\\}$ is infinitely far away from any point in the manifold. A geodesic, parameterized by arc-length, would require an infinite amount of time to reach this boundary. Therefore, no geodesic can leave the manifold in finite time. Every geodesic is defined for all $t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$, and the manifold is geodesically complete.\n\nThe Hopf-Rinow theorem provides several equivalent characterizations of completeness for a Riemannian manifold. One of the equivalences states that a manifold $(M, g)$ is geodesically complete if and only if the associated metric space $(M, d)$ is complete, where $d$ is the distance function induced by the metric $g$. Our finding that the distance to the boundary is infinite implies that any Cauchy sequence of points in $(M, d)$ must have a limit point within $M$ (i.e., its $y$-coordinate is bounded away from zero), meaning $(M, d)$ is a complete metric space.

We must now show that $(p_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in the metric $d_g$.\n\nA sequence $(p_n)$ is Cauchy if for every $\\varepsilon  0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, n  N$, we have $d_g(p_m, p_n)  \\varepsilon$. Without loss of generality, let $m  n$. We need to estimate the distance $d_g(p_n, p_m) = d_g((0, \\frac{1}{n}), (0, \\frac{1}{m}))$.\n\nThe distance $d_g(p,q)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise continuously differentiable curves connecting $p$ and $q$. Thus, the length of any specific curve provides an upper bound for the distance. Let's consider the vertical line segment $\\gamma$ connecting $p_n=(0, \\frac{1}{n})$ and $p_m=(0, \\frac{1}{m})$. We can parameterize this curve by the $y$-coordinate itself: $\\gamma(y) = (0, y)$ for $y \\in [\\frac{1}{m}, \\frac{1}{n}]$.\nThe tangent vector to this curve is $\\dot{\\gamma}(y) = (x'(y), y'(y)) = (0, 1)$.\nThe speed of the curve at a point $(0,y)$ is given by $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(y)\\|_g = \\sqrt{y^4 [\\dot{x}(y)]^2 + [\\dot{y}(y)]^2}$.\nFor our vertical path, $\\dot{x}(y)=0$ and $\\dot{y}(y)=1$, so the speed is $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(y)\\|_g = \\sqrt{y^4 \\cdot 0^2 + 1^2} = 1$.\n\nThe length of this path $\\gamma$ is:\n$$L_g(\\gamma) = \\int_{1/m}^{1/n} \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(y)\\|_g \\, dy = \\int_{1/m}^{1/n} 1 \\, dy = \\left[y\\right]_{1/m}^{1/n} = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{m}$$\nSince the distance $d_g(p_n, p_m)$ is the infimum over all path lengths, we have:\n$$d_g(p_n, p_m) \\leq L_g(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{m}$$\nFor any given $\\varepsilon  0$, we can choose $N$ such that $1/N  \\varepsilon$. Then for any $m, n  N$, we have $0  \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{m}  \\frac{1}{n}  \\frac{1}{N}  \\varepsilon$.\nThis shows that $d_g(p_n, p_m) \\to 0$ as $m, n \\to \\infty$. Therefore, the sequence $(p_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to the distance $d_g$.\n\nAs established, if this sequence were to converge to a point $p^*=(x^*, y^*) \\in M$, then by the definition of the manifold topology induced by the metric $d_g$, the sequence must also converge to $p^*$ in the standard subspace topology inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This would imply $(0, \\frac{1}{n}) \\to (x^*, y^*)$, which means $x^*=0$ and $y^*=0$. However, the point $(0,0)$ is not in $M$ since its $y$-coordinate is not positive. Thus, the sequence $(p_n)$ does not converge in $M$.\n\nThis construction explicitly shows that $(M, d_g)$ is not a complete metric space. By the Hopf-Rinow theorem, this implies that the manifold $(M,g)$ is geodesically incomplete. This means there exists at least one geodesic that cannot be extended for all values of its parameter. The path along which our Cauchy sequence lies is, in fact, an inextendible geodesic of finite length, which is the subject of the second part of the problem.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the distance to the boundary**\n\nFirst, we calculate the $g$-length of the vertical segment $\\{(0,y):y\\in[\\epsilon,1]\\}$. We use the parameterization $\\gamma_{\\epsilon}(y)=(0,y)$ for $y \\in [\\epsilon, 1]$. As calculated in Part 1, the tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\epsilon}(y) = (0,1)$ and its $g$-norm (speed) is $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\epsilon}(y)\\|_{g} = 1$.\nThe length is:\n$$L_g(\\gamma_\\epsilon) = \\int_{\\epsilon}^{1} 1 \\, dy = 1 - \\epsilon$$\nNow, we must find the distance from the point $(0,1)$ to the boundary line $y=0$. This is defined as the infimum of lengths of curves starting at $(0,1)$ and approaching the boundary. Let us first formalize the distance from $(0,1)$ to the line $P_\\epsilon = \\{(x,y) \\in M : y=\\epsilon\\}$. Let $\\gamma(t)=(x(t), y(t))$ be any piecewise $C^1$ curve defined on an interval $[a,b]$ connecting $(0,1)$ to some point $(x_f, \\epsilon)$, so that $y(a)=1$ and $y(b)=\\epsilon$.\n\nThe length of this curve is $L_g(\\gamma) = \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{y(t)^{4}\\dot{x}(t)^{2} + \\dot{y}(t)^{2}} \\,dt$.\nUsing the given inequality $\\sqrt{\\dot{y}(t)^{2}+y(t)^{4}\\dot{x}(t)^{2}}\\geq|\\dot{y}(t)|$, we can establish a lower bound for the length:\n$$L_g(\\gamma) \\geq \\int_{a}^{b} |\\dot{y}(t)| \\,dt$$\nThe integral $\\int_a^b |\\dot{y}(t)| dt$ represents the total variation of the $y$-coordinate along the curve $\\gamma$. This quantity is always greater than or equal to the magnitude of the net change in the $y$-coordinate, i.e., $|y(b)-y(a)|$.\n$$L_g(\\gamma) \\geq |y(b)-y(a)| = |\\epsilon - 1| = 1 - \\epsilon \\quad (\\text{since } \\epsilon1)$$\nThis inequality holds for any curve connecting a point on the line $y=1$ to a point on the line $y=\\epsilon$. It therefore provides a lower bound for the distance $d_g((0,1), (x_f, \\epsilon))$ for any $x_f$. The distance from the point $(0,1)$ to the entire line $P_\\epsilon$ is $d_g((0,1), P_\\epsilon) = \\inf_{q \\in P_\\epsilon} d_g((0,1), q)$, so we must have $d_g((0,1), P_\\epsilon) \\geq 1-\\epsilon$.\n\nHowever, we have found a specific path, the vertical segment from $(0,1)$ to $(0,\\epsilon)$, whose length is exactly $1-\\epsilon$. This path provides an upper bound for the distance: $d_g((0,1), P_\\epsilon) \\leq d_g((0,1), (0,\\epsilon)) \\leq 1-\\epsilon$.\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the distance from the point $(0,1)$ to the line $y=\\epsilon$ is precisely:\n$$d_g((0,1), P_\\epsilon) = 1-\\epsilon$$\nThe finite distance from $(0,1)$ to the boundary $y=0$ can be interpreted as the limit of this distance as $\\epsilon$ approaches $0$ from the positive side:\n$$d_g((0,1), \\text{boundary}) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} d_g((0,1), P_\\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} (1-\\epsilon) = 1$$\nAlternatively, we can consider the length of the vertical ray $\\gamma(s) = (0, 1-s)$ for $s \\in [0, 1)$. This curve starts at $\\gamma(0)=(0,1)$ and as $s \\to 1^-$, the $y$-coordinate $y(s)=1-s \\to 0$, so the curve \"reaches\" the boundary at finite parameter time $s=1$. The length of this curve is a path to the boundary:\n$$L_g(\\gamma) = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{y(s)^4 \\dot{x}(s)^2 + \\dot{y}(s)^2} \\, ds = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{(1-s)^4 \\cdot 0^2 + (-1)^2} \\, ds = \\int_0^1 1 \\, ds = 1$$\nSince any path from $(0,1)$ to the boundary must have a length of at least $1$, and we have found a path of length exactly $1$, the infimum of such lengths is $1$. This confirms that the distance to the boundary is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3028626"}]}
