The only non-zero derivative of the metric components is $\\partial_1 g_{22} = \\partial_\\theta (\\sin^2(\\theta)) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$.\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n$$\n\\Gamma^1_{22} = \\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\phi\\phi} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (-\\partial_1 g_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2}(1)(-2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)) = -\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\Gamma^{\\phi}_{\\theta\\phi} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_1 g_{22}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1}{\\sin^2(\\theta)} (2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)) = \\frac{\\cos(\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)} = \\cot(\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma^2_{21} = \\Gamma^{\\phi}_{\\phi\\theta} = \\Gamma^{\\phi}_{\\theta\\phi} = \\cot(\\theta)\n$$\nAll other Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are zero.\n\nThe geodesic equations, $\\frac{d^2 x^k}{dt^2} + \\Gamma^k_{ij} \\frac{dx^i}{dt} \\frac{dx^j}{dt} = 0$, for a curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\theta(t), \\phi(t))$ are:\nFor $k=1$ ($\\theta$):\n$$\n\\ddot{\\theta} + \\Gamma^1_{22} (\\dot{\\phi})^2 = 0 \\implies \\ddot{\\theta} - \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\dot{\\phi}^2 = 0\n$$\nFor $k=2$ ($\\phi$):\n$$\n\\ddot{\\phi} + 2\\Gamma^2_{12} \\dot{\\theta}\\dot{\\phi} = 0 \\implies \\ddot{\\phi} + 2\\cot(\\theta)\\dot{\\theta}\\dot{\\phi} = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies the initial conditions for the geodesic $\\gamma(t)$. The starting point is the north pole $p$, which corresponds to $\\theta = 0$. So, $\\gamma(0)=p \\implies \\theta(0)=0$. The initial velocity $\\dot{\\gamma}(0)$ is orthogonal to the parallels, which means its component in the $\\phi$ direction is zero, i.e., $\\dot{\\phi}(0)=0$. The geodesic has unit speed, so $|\\dot{\\gamma}(0)|_g = 1$. The speed squared is given by $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = \\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta)\\dot{\\phi}^2$. At $t=0$, we have:\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta}(0)^2 + \\sin^2(\\theta(0))\\dot{\\phi}(0)^2 = \\dot{\\theta}(0)^2 + \\sin^2(0) \\cdot 0^2 = 1\n$$\nThis gives $\\dot{\\theta}(0)^2=1$, so we choose $\\dot{\\theta}(0)=1$ (the negative sign would simply trace the geodesic in the opposite sense).\n\nLet's solve the geodesic equations with initial conditions $\\theta(0)=0$, $\\dot{\\theta}(0)=1$, $\\dot{\\phi}(0)=0$.\nConsider the second geodesic equation for $\\phi$. It can be rewritten. Multiplying by $\\sin^2(\\theta)$, we get $\\sin^2(\\theta)\\ddot{\\phi} + 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\dot{\\theta}\\dot{\\phi} = 0$. This is equivalent to $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin^2(\\theta)\\dot{\\phi}) = 0$. This implies $\\sin^2(\\theta(t))\\dot{\\phi}(t) = C$ for some constant $C$.\nUsing the initial conditions at $t=0$, we have $C = \\sin^2(\\theta(0))\\dot{\\phi}(0) = \\sin^2(0) \\cdot 0=0$.\nSo, $\\sin^2(\\theta(t))\\dot{\\phi}(t) = 0$ for all $t$. As long as $\\theta(t) \\in (0, \\pi)$, we must have $\\dot{\\phi}(t)=0$. Since $\\dot{\\phi}(0)=0$, we conclude that $\\phi(t)$ is constant, say $\\phi(t) = \\phi_0$.\n\nWith $\\dot{\\phi}(t)=0$ for all $t$, the first geodesic equation simplifies to $\\ddot{\\theta}(t) = 0$.\nIntegrating twice gives $\\theta(t) = C_1 t + C_2$.\nApplying the initial conditions:\n$\\theta(0)=0 \\implies C_2=0$.\n$\\dot{\\theta}(t)=C_1$, so $\\dot{\\theta}(0)=1 \\implies C_1=1$.\nThus, the geodesic is given by $\\theta(t) = t$ and $\\phi(t) = \\phi_0$.\nThis geodesic represents a meridian on the sphere, parameterized by arc length $t$.\n\nNow we must find the cut time $t_{\\mathrm{cut}}$. This is the supremum of $t  0$ such that the geodesic segment $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ from $p=\\gamma(0)$ to $q=\\gamma(t)$ is a globally minimizing path.\n\nMethod 1: Geometric Argument\nThe geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is an arc of a great circle (a meridian) starting at the north pole $p$. The length of this arc from $p$ to $q=\\gamma(t)$ is $L(\\gamma|_{[0,t]}) = \\int_0^t |\\dot{\\gamma}(s)|_g ds = \\int_0^t 1 ds = t$.\nOn a sphere, the shortest distance between two points is the length of the shorter great circle arc connecting them. Our geodesic $\\gamma$ provides one such arc.\nThe point $p$ is the north pole ($\\theta=0$). The point $q=\\gamma(t)$ is at polar angle $\\theta=t$.\nAs long as $t  \\pi$, the arc $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ is the unique shortest path between $p$ and $q$.\nWhen $t=\\pi$, the point $q=\\gamma(\\pi)$ is at polar angle $\\theta=\\pi$. This is the south pole, the antipode of $p$. At this point, there are infinitely many great circle arcs of length $\\pi$ connecting the north and south poles (all the meridians). The geodesic $\\gamma|_{[0,\\pi]}$ is still a minimizing path, but it is no longer the unique minimizer. Its length is $\\pi$.\nWhen $t  \\pi$, say $t=\\pi+\\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon  0$, the geodesic $\\gamma$ continues past the south pole. The length of the path $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ is $t=\\pi+\\epsilon$. However, the point $\\gamma(\\pi+\\epsilon)$ can be reached from the north pole by a shorter path. The shorter great circle arc connecting $p$ and $\\gamma(\\pi+\\epsilon)$ has length $2\\pi - (\\pi+\\epsilon) = \\pi-\\epsilon$. Since $\\pi-\\epsilon  \\pi+\\epsilon$, the geodesic $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ is no longer a globally minimizing path for $t  \\pi$.\nThe definition of the cut time $t_{\\mathrm{cut}}$ is the supremum of $t$ for which $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ is distance-minimizing. Since the geodesic is minimizing for all $t \\in [0,\\pi]$ and not minimizing for any $t  \\pi$, the supremum is $\\pi$.\nThus, $t_{\\mathrm{cut}} = \\pi$.\n\nMethod 2: Jacobi Field Analysis\nThe cut point can also be identified as the first conjugate point along the geodesic. A point $\\gamma(t_0)$ is conjugate to $\\gamma(0)$ if there exists a non-trivial Jacobi field $J(t)$ along $\\gamma$ such that $J(0)=0$ and $J(t_0)=0$.\nThe Jacobi equation is $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$.\nFor a manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$, the curvature tensor is $R(X,Y)Z = K(g(Y,Z)X - g(X,Z)Y)$.\nThe unit sphere $S^2$ has constant sectional curvature $K=1$. Our geodesic $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, so $g(\\dot{\\gamma},\\dot{\\gamma})=1$. The Jacobi equation becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + g(\\dot{\\gamma},\\dot{\\gamma})J - g(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0 \\implies \\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + J - g(J,\\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = 0\n$$\nWe are interested in Jacobi fields corresponding to a variation of geodesics, which are orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}$. For a Jacobi field $J(t)$ with $J(0) = 0$ and $g(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(0), \\dot{\\gamma}(0)) = 0$, it follows that $g(J(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t)) = 0$ for all $t$.\nFor such a normal Jacobi field, the equation simplifies to $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} J + J = 0$.\nLet $\\{E_1(t), E_2(t)\\}$ be a parallel-transported orthonormal frame along $\\gamma$, with $E_1(t)=\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. We can write a normal Jacobi field as $J(t) = f(t)E_2(t)$ for some scalar function $f(t)$. Then $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J = \\dot{f}E_2$ and $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J = \\ddot{f}E_2$.\nSubstituting into the simplified Jacobi equation gives $(\\ddot{f}(t) + f(t))E_2(t) = 0$, which implies the scalar ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\ddot{f}(t) + f(t) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $f(t) = A\\cos(t) + B\\sin(t)$.\nThe condition $J(0)=0$ implies $f(0)=0$.\n$f(0) = A\\cos(0) + B\\sin(0) = A = 0$.\nSo the solution is $f(t) = B\\sin(t)$. For a non-trivial Jacobi field, we must have $B \\neq 0$. This constant is determined by the initial conditions of the field variation, specifically $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}}J(0) = B E_2(0)$.\nWe seek the first time $t_0  0$ such that $J(t_0)=0$. This means $f(t_0)=0$.\n$B\\sin(t_0) = 0$. Since $B \\neq 0$, we require $\\sin(t_0) = 0$.\nThe smallest positive solution for $t_0$ is $t_0 = \\pi$.\nThis means the first conjugate point to the north pole $p$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$ occurs at $t=\\pi$.\nAccording to the Morse-Schoenberg comparison theorem, a geodesic segment is minimizing if and only if it contains no conjugate points in its interior.\nFor any $t \\in (0, \\pi)$, the segment $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ contains no conjugate points, so it is minimizing.\nFor any $t  \\pi$, the segment $\\gamma|_{[0,t]}$ contains the conjugate point $\\gamma(\\pi)$ in its interior, so it is not minimizing.\nAt $t=\\pi$, the conjugate point is at the endpoint. The segment $\\gamma|_{[0,\\pi]}$ is still minimizing.\nThe cut time is the time of the first conjugate point, provided no other point on the geodesic is joined to the start point by a shorter geodesic. On the sphere, this condition holds.\nThus, $t_{\\mathrm{cut}} = \\pi$.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the cut time is $\\pi$.
