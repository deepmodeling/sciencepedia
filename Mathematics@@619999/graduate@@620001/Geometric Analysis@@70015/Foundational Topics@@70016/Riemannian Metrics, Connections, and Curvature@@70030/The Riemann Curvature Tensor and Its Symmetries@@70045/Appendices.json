We begin by establishing the specific form of the Riemann curvature tensor $R$ under this condition.\n\nA fundamental theorem in Riemannian geometry states that if an $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with $n \\ge 2$ has constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$, its Riemann curvature tensor $R$ is given by\n$$\nR(u,v)z = \\kappa (\\langle v,z \\rangle u - \\langle u,z \\rangle v)\n$$\nfor any tangent vectors $u,v,z \\in T_{q}M$ at any point $q \\in M$. This expression for $R$ is derived from the definition of constant sectional curvature and the algebraic symmetries of the Riemann tensor. To see this, one can define a tensor $R_0(u,v)z = \\kappa (\\langle v,z \\rangle u - \\langle u,z \\rangle v)$ and verify two key properties:\n$1$. $R_0$ satisfies all the algebraic symmetries of a Riemann curvature tensor: antisymmetry in the first two slots, the first Bianchi identity, and the pair interchange symmetry.\n$2$. The sectional curvature corresponding to $R_0$ is constant. For any orthonormal pair $\\{u, v\\}$, the sectional curvature is $\\langle R_0(u,v)v, u \\rangle = \\langle \\kappa(\\langle v,v \\rangle u - \\langle u,v \\rangle v), u \\rangle = \\langle \\kappa(1 \\cdot u - 0 \\cdot v), u \\rangle = \\kappa \\langle u, u \\rangle = \\kappa$.\nA tensor with the symmetries of the Riemann tensor is uniquely determined by its sectional curvatures. Since both $R$ and $R_0$ have the same constant sectional curvature $\\kappa$, they must be identical. This justifies using the explicit formula for $R$.\n\nNow, we use this form of the Riemann tensor to determine the action of the curvature operator $\\mathcal{R}_{p} : \\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M) \\to \\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M)$. The operator is defined by its action within the inner product on $\\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M)$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathcal{R}_{p}(u \\wedge v),\\, w \\wedge z \\rangle = \\langle R_{p}(u,v)z,\\, w \\rangle\n$$\nfor all $u,v,w,z \\in T_{p}M$.

Thus, for any $\\alpha \\in \\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M)$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}_{p}(\\alpha) = \\kappa \\alpha\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the curvature operator $\\mathcal{R}_{p}$ is simply scalar multiplication by $\\kappa$ on the space $\\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M)$.

This verifies the assertion in the problem statement.\n\nThe spectrum of an operator is the set of its eigenvalues. For the operator $\\mathcal{R}_{p} = \\kappa \\cdot \\text{Id}$, any non-zero vector $\\alpha \\in \\Lambda^{2}(T_{p}M)$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\kappa$, since $\\mathcal{R}_{p}(\\alpha) = \\kappa \\alpha$. Therefore, the spectrum of $\\mathcal{R}_{p}$ consists of the single value $\\{\\kappa\\}$.
