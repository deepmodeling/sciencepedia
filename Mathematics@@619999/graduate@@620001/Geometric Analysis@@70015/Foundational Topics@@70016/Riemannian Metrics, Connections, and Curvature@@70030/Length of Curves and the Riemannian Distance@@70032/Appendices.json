The curve $\\gamma(t)=t+1$ maps the domain $[0,T]$ to $[1, T+1]$, which lies entirely within $M$. The problem is complete, consistent, and mathematically sound.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts. First, the general derivation of the arc-length parameter and the justification for its invertibility. Second, the application of this framework to the specific case provided.\n\n**Part 1: General Derivation of Arc-Length and its Inverse**\n\nLet $(M,g)$ be a smooth Riemannian manifold and $\\gamma:I\\to M$ be a continuously differentiable ($C^1$) curve, where $I=[a,b]$ is a closed interval in $\\mathbb{R}$. The tangent vector to the curve at parameter value $t$ is denoted by $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) \\in T_{\\gamma(t)}M$. The Riemannian metric $g$ provides an inner product on each tangent space. The speed of the curve at $t$ is the norm of the tangent vector, defined as $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g} = \\sqrt{g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))}$.\n\nThe length of the curve $\\gamma$ over the interval $[a,b]$ is defined as the integral of its speed:\n$$ L(\\gamma) = \\int_{a}^{b} \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g} \\, dt $$\nThe arc-length function, $s(t)$, measures the length of the curve from a fixed basepoint $t_0 \\in I$ to a variable point $t \\in I$. Without loss of generality, let's set $t_0=a$. Then, for any $t \\in [a,b]$, the arc-length function is given by:\n$$ s(t) = \\int_{a}^{t} \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(\\tau)\\|_{g} \\, d\\tau $$\nTo justify the existence of an inverse reparametrization $t=t(s)$, we must show that $s(t)$ is a continuously differentiable (at least $C^1$) and strictly monotonic function.\n\nSince $\\gamma$ is a $C^1$ curve and $g$ is a smooth metric, the composition $g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\dot{\\gamma}(t), \\dot{\\gamma}(t))$ is a continuous function of $t$. The square root function is continuous for non-negative arguments. Thus, the speed $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g}$ is a continuous function of $t$.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the arc-length function $s(t)$, being the integral of a continuous function, is differentiable with respect to $t$, and its derivative is the integrand itself:\n$$ \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{a}^{t} \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(\\tau)\\|_{g} \\, d\\tau = \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g} $$\nSince $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g}$ is continuous, the derivative $\\frac{ds}{dt}$ is continuous, which means $s(t)$ is a $C^1$ function.\n\nThe problem states the hypothesis that the speed is strictly positive, i.e., $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g} > 0$ for all $t \\in I$. A curve with this property is called a regular curve. This implies that:\n$$ \\frac{ds}{dt} > 0 \\quad \\forall t \\in I $$\nA differentiable function on an interval with a strictly positive derivative is strictly increasing. Therefore, $s(t)$ is a strictly monotonic function on $I$.\n\nA continuous, strictly monotonic function defined on an interval has a continuous inverse. Furthermore, since $s(t)$ is a $C^1$ function with a non-vanishing derivative on $I$, the Inverse Function Theorem guarantees the existence of a $C^1$ inverse function $t(s)$ defined on the image interval $s(I)$. The derivative of this inverse function is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dt}{ds} = \\left(\\frac{ds}{dt}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t(s))\\|_{g}} $$\nThis completes the rigorous justification for the existence of the inverse reparametrization $t=t(s)$.\n\n**Part 2: Specialization and Calculation**\n\nWe are given the one-dimensional manifold $M=(0,\\infty)$ with a single coordinate $x$. The metric is $g_{x}=x^{2}\\,dx^{2}$. This means the single component of the metric tensor in this coordinate system is $g_{11}(x)=x^2$. The curve is $\\gamma:[0,T]\\to M$ defined by $\\gamma(t)=t+1$. In the coordinate $x$, this is $x(t) = t+1$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the tangent vector and its speed. The tangent vector in coordinate form is $\\dot{x}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(t+1) = 1$.\nThe speed $\\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g}$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g} = \\sqrt{g_{11}(x(t)) (\\dot{x}(t))^2} = \\sqrt{(x(t))^2 \\cdot (1)^2} = \\sqrt{(t+1)^2} $$\nSince the parameter domain is $t \\in [0,T]$ with $T>0$, the term $t+1$ is always positive (specifically, $t+1 \\ge 1$). Therefore, we can simplify the square root:\n$$ \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(t)\\|_{g} = |t+1| = t+1 $$\nThe speed is strictly positive on the domain, as required.\n\nNext, we compute the arc-length function $s(t)$ with the basepoint $t_0=0$:\n$$ s(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\|\\dot{\\gamma}(\\tau)\\|_{g} \\, d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} (\\tau+1) \\, d\\tau $$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$ s(t) = \\left[ \\frac{\\tau^2}{2} + \\tau \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\left(\\frac{t^2}{2} + t\\right) - \\left(\\frac{0^2}{2} + 0\\right) = \\frac{t^2}{2} + t $$\nSo, the arc-length function is $s(t) = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t$.\n\nFinally, we find the inverse reparametrization $t(s)$ by solving the equation $s = \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t$ for $t$. We can rewrite this as a standard quadratic equation in the variable $t$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}t^2 + t - s = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $2$ to clear the fraction, we get:\n$$ t^2 + 2t - 2s = 0 $$\nWe apply the quadratic formula, $t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a=1$, $b=2$, and $c=-2s$:\n$$ t = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-2s)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 8s}}{2} $$\n$$ t = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4(1+2s)}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{1+2s}}{2} $$\n$$ t = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+2s} $$\nWe have two possible solutions for $t$. To select the correct one, we recall that the original parameter $t$ belongs to the interval $[0,T]$, so we must have $t \\ge 0$. The arc-length $s=s(t)$ is non-negative since $t \\ge 0$.\nThe term $\\sqrt{1+2s}$ is greater than or equal to $1$ for $s \\ge 0$.\nLet's examine the two solutions:\n1.  $t = -1 - \\sqrt{1+2s}$: Since $\\sqrt{1+2s} \\ge 1$, this solution yields $t \\le -2$, which is outside the valid domain for $t$.\n2.  $t = -1 + \\sqrt{1+2s}$: Since $\\sqrt{1+2s} \\ge 1$, this solution yields $t \\ge 0$. This is consistent with the domain of the original curve parameter.\n\nTherefore, the unique valid inverse reparametrization is $t(s) = -1 + \\sqrt{1+2s}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1 + \\sqrt{1+2s}}$$", "id": "3031758"}, {"introduction": "With the ability to calculate the length of any given path, we can now seek the shortest path between two points, which defines the Riemannian distance.

It is a valid, solvable problem in geometric analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe manifold is $M = S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$, which can be viewed as a cylinder. The metric is given by $g = d\\theta^2 + \\lambda^2 dz^2$. We are given $\\lambda=3$, so the metric is $g = d\\theta^2 + 9 dz^2$.\n\nThe Riemannian manifold $(M, g)$ is locally isometric to the Euclidean plane. To see this, consider the coordinate system $(u,v)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ where $u = \\theta$ and $v = \\lambda z = 3z$. In these coordinates, $du=d\\theta$ and $dv=3dz$, so the metric becomes $g = du^2 + dv^2$, which is the standard Euclidean metric. The manifold $M$ can be realized as the quotient of this Euclidean plane by the group of isometries generated by the translation $(u,v) \\mapsto (u+2\\pi, v)$.\n\nThe Riemannian distance $d(p,q)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise $C^1$ curves connecting $p$ and $q$. On a complete Riemannian manifold, this infimum is always achieved by a minimizing geodesic. The geodesics on the quotient manifold $M$ are the projections of straight lines from its universal covering space, which is the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with coordinates $(\\theta, z)$.\n\nLet the point $p=(0,0)$ be represented by the origin $(0,0)$ in the covering space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The point $q=(\\pi, h)$ on the cylinder corresponds to a set of points in the covering space, given by $\\{q_k = (\\pi + 2\\pi k, h) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\nThe distance $d(p,q)$ on the cylinder is the minimum of the distances in the covering space from the point $(0,0)$ to any of the points $q_k$. The length of a curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\theta(t), z(t))$ from $t=0$ to $t=1$ is $L(\\gamma) = \\int_0^1 \\sqrt{\\dot{\\theta}(t)^2 + 9\\dot{z}(t)^2} dt$. For a straight line in the $(\\theta,z)$ plane from $(0,0)$ to $(\\theta_1, z_1)$, this length is $\\sqrt{\\theta_1^2 + 9z_1^2}$.\n\n**1. Computation of the Riemannian distance $d(p,q)$**\n\nWe need to compute the distance from $p=(0,0)$ to each pre-image $q_k=(\\pi+2\\pi k, h)$ and find the minimum value. The square of the distance from $p$ to $q_k$ is:\n$$d(p, q_k)^2 = (\\Delta\\theta)^2 + 9(\\Delta z)^2 = ((\\pi + 2\\pi k) - 0)^2 + 9(h - 0)^2 = \\pi^2(1+2k)^2 + 9h^2$$\nThe Riemannian distance $d(p,q)$ is the minimum of these values over all integers $k$:\n$$d(p,q) = \\min_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\sqrt{\\pi^2(1+2k)^2 + 9h^2}$$\nTo minimize this expression, we must minimize the term $|\\pi(1+2k)|$. Since $k$ is an integer, $1+2k$ is always an odd integer. The odd integers closest to $0$ are $1$ and $-1$.\n-   For $k=0$, $1+2k=1$, and the squared distance is $\\pi^2(1)^2 + 9h^2 = \\pi^2 + 9h^2$.\n-   For $k=-1$, $1+2k=-1$, and the squared distance is $\\pi^2(-1)^2 + 9h^2 = \\pi^2 + 9h^2$.\nFor any other integer $k$, $|1+2k| > 1$, which results in a larger distance. Therefore, the minimum distance squared is $\\pi^2 + 9h^2$.\n\nThe Riemannian distance is the square root of this value:\n$$d(p,q) = \\sqrt{\\pi^2 + 9h^2}$$\n\n**2. Existence and Parametrization of Minimizing Geodesics**\n\nThe minimum distance is achieved for two different values of $k$, namely $k=0$ and $k=-1$. This corresponds to two distinct pre-images of $q$ in the covering space being equidistant from $p=(0,0)$:\n-   $q_0 = (\\pi, h)$\n-   $q_{-1} = (-\\pi, h)$\n\nEach of these gives rise to a minimizing geodesic on the cylinder $M$ by projecting the straight line segment from $(0,0)$ in the covering space.\nLet the parameter be $t \\in [0,1]$.\n\n**Geodesic 1 ($\\gamma_1$):** This is the projection of the straight line from $(0,0)$ to $q_0 = (\\pi,h)$.\nThe parametrization in the covering space is $(1-t)(0,0) + t(\\pi,h) = (t\\pi, th)$.\nProjecting onto $M$, we get the geodesic:\n$$\\gamma_1(t) = (t\\pi, th), \\quad t \\in [0,1]$$\nThis path starts at $\\gamma_1(0)=(0,0)=p$ and ends at $\\gamma_1(1)=(\\pi,h)=q$.\n\n**Geodesic 2 ($\\gamma_2$):** This is the projection of the straight line from $(0,0)$ to $q_{-1} = (-\\pi,h)$.\nThe parametrization in the covering space is $(1-t)(0,0) + t(-\\pi,h) = (-t\\pi, th)$.\nProjecting onto $M$, we get the geodesic:\n$$\\gamma_2(t) = (-t\\pi, th), \\quad t \\in [0,1]$$\nThis path starts at $\\gamma_2(0)=(0,0)=p$. It ends at $\\gamma_2(1)=(-\\pi,h)$. On the cylinder, the coordinate $\\theta=-\\pi$ is identified with $\\theta=\\pi$, so the endpoint is indeed $q=(\\pi,h)$.\n\nThe two geodesics $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are distinct. For any $t \\in (0,1)$, the $\\theta$-coordinate of $\\gamma_1(t)$ is $t\\pi \\in (0,\\pi)$, while the $\\theta$-coordinate of $\\gamma_2(t)$ is $-t\\pi \\in (-\\pi,0)$. These represent distinct points on the circle $S^1$. For example, at $t=1/2$, $\\gamma_1(1/2) = (\\pi/2, h/2)$ and $\\gamma_2(1/2)=(-\\pi/2, h/2)$. These are distinct points on $M$. Thus, there are two distinct minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$.\n\n**3. The Cut Locus $\\operatorname{Cut}(p)$**\n\nThe cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}(p)$ of a point $p$ is the set of all points $q$ for which there exists more than one minimizing geodesic from $p$ to $q$, or, equivalently, the closure of the set of points where geodesics from $p$ cease to be minimizing.\n\nFor our point $p=(0,0)$, let's find the locus of points $q' = (\\theta', z')$ which can be reached by more than one minimizing geodesic. As established, this occurs when there are at least two pre-images of $q'$ in the covering space that are equidistant from $(0,0)$ and closer than any other pre-image.\nThe squared distance from $(0,0)$ to a pre-image $(\\theta' + 2\\pi k, z')$ is $(\\theta' + 2\\pi k)^2 + 9(z')^2$.\nFor a given $z'$, the distance depends on the term $|\\theta' + 2\\pi k|$.\nLet's assume the coordinate $\\theta'$ is in the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. The shortest path in the $\\theta$ direction will have a displacement of either $\\theta'$ (for $k=0$) or $2\\pi - \\theta'$ (for $\\theta' > 0$, from $k=-1$, giving displacement $\\theta'-2\\pi$) or $2\\pi+\\theta'$ (for $\\theta'<0$, from $k=1$, giving displacement $\\theta'+2\\pi$).\nMultiple minimizing geodesics exist if the magnitudes of the two smallest displacements are equal.\nIf we take $\\theta' \\in [0, \\pi]$, the two candidates for minimal $|\\Delta\\theta|$ are $\\theta'$ (from $k=0$) and $2\\pi-\\theta'$ (from $k=-1$, as $|\\theta'-2\\pi|=2\\pi-\\theta'$).\nEquality holds if $\\theta' = 2\\pi - \\theta'$, which implies $2\\theta' = 2\\pi$, or $\\theta' = \\pi$.\nIf we take $\\theta' \\in (-\\pi, 0)$, the candidates are $|\\theta'| = -\\theta'$ (from $k=0$) and $|\\theta'+2\\pi|=\\theta'+2\\pi$ (from $k=1$).\nEquality holds if $-\\theta' = \\theta'+2\\pi$, which implies $-2\\pi = 2\\theta'$, so $\\theta'=-\\pi$.\nSince $\\theta=\\pi$ and $\\theta=-\\pi$ represent the same set of points on the cylinder, the condition for non-unique minimizing geodesics is that the angular coordinate is $\\pi$.\n\nThe cut locus of $p=(0,0)$ is the set of all points with $\\theta$-coordinate equal to $\\pi$:\n$$\\operatorname{Cut}(p) = \\{(\\pi, z) \\mid z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$$\nThis is the line on the cylinder \"antipodal\" to the line $\\theta=0$ containing $p$.\n\nThe point $q=(\\pi, h)$ lies on this cut locus $\\operatorname{Cut}(p)$. By the very definition of the cut locus, this is the reason for the existence of (at least) two minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $q$. The geometry of the cylinder creates a scenario where traveling \"left\" (negative $\\theta$ direction) or \"right\" (positive $\\theta$ direction) to the antipodal line covers the same angular distance $(\\pi)$ and, for a fixed vertical displacement $(h)$, results in two paths of identical minimal length.\n\nThe required final answer is the expression for the distance $d(p,q)$.\n$$d(p,q) = \\sqrt{\\pi^2 + 9h^2}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\pi^{2} + 9h^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "3031761"}, {"introduction": "A key result, the Hopf-Rinow theorem, guarantees that on a complete Riemannian manifold, any two points can be joined by a distance-minimizing geodesic.

Here, the manifold is $M=\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n**1.

We must verify three properties:\n-   **Symmetry:** The Euclidean inner product is symmetric, $v \\cdot w = w \\cdot v$. Therefore, $g_x(v,w) = \\exp(-2|x|^2) v \\cdot w = \\exp(-2|x|^2) w \\cdot v = g_x(w,v)$. The form is symmetric.\n-   **Positive-definiteness:** For any non-zero vector $v \\in T_x\\mathbb{R}^n$, we have $v \\cdot v = |v|^2 > 0$.

This shows $g_x$ is positive-definite, and thus an inner product on $T_x\\mathbb{R}^n$ for each $x$.\n-   **Smoothness:** In the standard Cartesian coordinate system $(x^1, \\dots, x^n)$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the components of the metric tensor are given by $g_{ij}(x) = g_x(\\partial_i, \\partial_j)$. Identifying the basis vectors $\\partial_i$ with the standard basis vectors $e_i$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we have $g_{ij}(x) = \\exp(-2|x|^2) e_i \\cdot e_j = \\exp(-2|x|^2) \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The function $|x|^2 = (x^1)^2 + \\dots + (x^n)^2$ is a polynomial and thus smooth. The exponential function is also smooth. The composition $\\exp(-2|x|^2)$ is a $C^\\infty$ function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Since all components $g_{ij}(x)$ are smooth functions, the metric $g$ is a smooth Riemannian metric.\n\n**2. Length of a radial segment:**\nThe problem asks for the length of the straight radial segment $\\gamma(t) = tu$ for $t \\in [a, b]$, where $u \\in \\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is a fixed unit vector and $0 \\leq a < b < \\infty$.\nThe Riemannian length $L(\\gamma)$ of a smooth curve $\\gamma: [a,b] \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is defined by the integral:\n$$\nL(\\gamma) = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t))} \\, dt\n$$\nFor the curve $\\gamma(t) = tu$, the tangent vector is $\\gamma'(t) = u$.\nThe position of the point on the curve is $x = \\gamma(t) = tu$. Its Euclidean norm is $|x| = |tu| = |t||u| = t$, since $t \\ge 0$ and $|u|=1$.\nThe norm of the tangent vector $\\gamma'(t)=u$ with respect to the metric $g$ at the point $\\gamma(t)$ is:\n$$\ng_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t)) = g_{tu}(u, u) = \\exp(-2|tu|^2) (u \\cdot u) = \\exp(-2t^2) |u|^2 = \\exp(-2t^2)\n$$\nThe integrand, which represents the speed of the curve, is $\\sqrt{g_{\\gamma(t)}(\\gamma'(t), \\gamma'(t))} = \\sqrt{\\exp(-2t^2)} = \\exp(-t^2)$.\nThe length of the segment from $t=a$ to $t=b$ is the integral of this speed:\n$$\nL(\\gamma|_{[a,b]}) = \\int_a^b \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Total Length of the Ray\n\nWe are asked to compute the total Riemannian length $L$ of the ray $c(t) = tu$ for $t \\in [0, \\infty)$. Using the result from Part 1, we set $a=0$ and take the limit as $b \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nL = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt\n$$\nThis is a well-known definite integral, related to the Gaussian integral. The value of the Gaussian integral over the entire real line is $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt = \\sqrt{\\pi}$.\nSince the integrand $\\exp(-t^2)$ is an even function, the integral from $0$ to $\\infty$ is half of the integral over the entire line:\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\n$$\nThe total Riemannian length of the radial ray is finite and equals $\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}$.\n\n### Part 3: Cauchy Sequence and Non-Convergence\n\nWe consider the sequence of points $p_k = ku$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (we assume $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$).\n\n**1. The sequence $\\{p_k\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence:**\nThe Riemannian distance $d_g(p, q)$ is the infimum of the lengths of all piecewise smooth curves connecting points $p$ and $q$. For the conformal metric $g_x(v, w) = \\exp(-2|x|^2) v \\cdot w$, the geodesics starting from the origin are the radial rays. Thus, the shortest path between two points $p_k = ku$ and $p_m = mu$ on the same ray (with, say, $m>k$) is the radial segment connecting them.\nThe distance between $p_k$ and $p_m$ for $m > k$ is given by the length integral derived in Part 1:\n$$\nd_g(p_k, p_m) = \\int_k^m \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt\n$$\nTo show $\\{p_k\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to $d_g$, we must show that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m, k > N$, we have $d_g(p_k, p_m) < \\epsilon$.\nLet's assume $m>k$. The distance can be written as:\n$$\nd_g(p_k, p_m) = \\int_0^m \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt - \\int_0^k \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt\n$$\nLet's define a sequence $S_k = \\int_0^k \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt$. From Part 2, we know that this sequence of real numbers converges as $k \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} S_k = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-t^2) \\, dt = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\n$$\nEvery convergent sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Cauchy sequence. Therefore, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists an $N$ such that for all $m, k > N$, $|S_m - S_k| < \\epsilon$.\nSince $d_g(p_k, p_m) = |S_m - S_k|$, it follows that $\\{p_k\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in the metric space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_g)$.\n\n**2. The sequence $\\{p_k\\}$ does not converge in $\\mathbb{R}^n$:**\nWe need to show that there is no point $p_\\infty \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\\lim_{k\\to\\infty} d_g(p_k, p_\\infty) = 0$. The argument relies on the local properties of the metric, specifically that it induces the same topology as the standard Euclidean metric on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nLet $d_e(x, y) = |x-y|$ be the standard Euclidean distance. The topology induced by a metric is generated by the set of open balls. We show that the topology induced by $d_g$ is identical to the one induced by $d_e$.\nFor any point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, consider a compact neighborhood $K$, for example, the closed Euclidean ball $\\bar{B}_e(x_0, 1)$. The conformal factor $\\Omega(x) = \\exp(-2|x|^2)$ is continuous and strictly positive. On the compact set $K$, it attains its minimum $C_{min}$ and maximum $C_{max}$, which are both positive constants.\nFor any two points $x, y \\in K$ and any path $\\gamma$ in $K$ connecting them, its Riemannian length $L_g(\\gamma)$ and Euclidean length $L_e(\\gamma)$ are related by:\n$$\n\\sqrt{C_{min}} L_e(\\gamma) \\le L_g(\\gamma) \\le \\sqrt{C_{max}} L_e(\\gamma)\n$$\nTaking the infimum over all paths between $x$ and $y$ (which must pass through $K$ if $x,y$ are close enough), we get:\n$$\n\\sqrt{C_{min}} d_e(x, y) \\le d_g(x, y) \\le \\sqrt{C_{max}} d_e(x, y) \\quad \\text{for } x,y \\text{ in a neighborhood of } x_0\n$$\nThis local bi-Lipschitz equivalence implies that the identity map between $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_g)$ and $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_e)$ is a homeomorphism. Therefore, the two metrics induce the same topology on the set $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nA sequence of points converges in a topological space if and only if it converges in any other topological space with an equivalent topology. Thus, convergence in $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_g)$ is equivalent to convergence in $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_e)$.\nLet's examine the sequence $p_k = ku$ in the Euclidean space. Its Euclidean norm is $|p_k|_e = |ku| = k|u| = k$. As $k \\to \\infty$, $|p_k|_e \\to \\infty$. The sequence is unbounded in the Euclidean sense and therefore does not converge to any point $p_\\infty \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$.\nSince the sequence does not converge in the standard Euclidean topology, it cannot converge in the equivalent Riemannian topology either.\n\nIn conclusion, $\\{p_k\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in the metric space $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d_g)$ that does not converge to any point within the space. This demonstrates that the Riemannian manifold $(\\mathbb{R}^n, g)$ is not a complete metric space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}}$$", "id": "3031743"}]}
