The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we establish the transformation law for the components of a $(2,0)$-tensor field under a change of coordinates. Let $T$ be a $(2,0)$-tensor. In a coordinate system $(x^a)$, it can be expressed as $T = \\sum_{a,b} T^{ab} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^a} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^b}$. In another coordinate system $(u^i)$, it is $T = \\sum_{i,j} T'^{ij} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^i} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^j}$. The basis vectors themselves transform according to the chain rule as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^a} = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^i}$. Substituting this into the first expression for $T$:\n$$T = \\sum_{a,b} T^{ab} \\left(\\sum_i \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^i}\\right) \\otimes \\left(\\sum_j \\frac{\\partial u^j}{\\partial x^b} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^j}\\right) = \\sum_{i,j} \\left(\\sum_{a,b} T^{ab} \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a} \\frac{\\partial u^j}{\\partial x^b}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^i} \\otimes \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u^j}$$\nBy comparing coefficients, we derive the transformation law for the contravariant components:\n$$T'^{ij} = \\sum_{a,b=1}^2 T^{ab} \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a} \\frac{\\partial u^j}{\\partial x^b}$$\nIn matrix notation, this is $T' = A T A^T$, where $(A)^i{}_a = \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation.\n\nNext, we compute the necessary quantities at the point $p=(x,y)=(1,1)=(x^1,x^2)$. The coordinate transformation is given by $u^1=u=x^2+y$ and $u^2=v=x+y^2$. The Jacobian matrix $A$ of the transformation $\\Phi$ has components $A^i{}_a = \\frac{\\partial u^i}{\\partial x^a}$:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u^1}{\\partial x^1} & \\frac{\\partial u^1}{\\partial x^2} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u^2}{\\partial x^1} & \\frac{\\partial u^2}{\\partial x^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2y \\end{pmatrix}$$\nEvaluating at $p=(1,1)$:\n$$A_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(1) & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe components of the tensor field $T$ in the $(x,y)$ coordinates at $p$ are:\n$T^{11}(1,1) = 1+1=2$\n$T^{12}(1,1) = (1)(1)=1$\n$T^{21}(1,1) = 1^2=1$\n$T^{22}(1,1) = 1^2=1$\nIn matrix form, the components at $p$ are represented by the matrix $T_p$:\n$$T_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe now apply the transformation law $T'_p = A_p T_p A_p^T$ to find the components $T'^{ij}$ in the $(u,v)$ coordinates at $p$:\n$$T'_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$T'_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(2)+1(1) & 2(1)+1(1) \\\\ 1(2)+2(1) & 1(1)+2(1) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 3 \\\\ 4 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$T'_p = \\begin{pmatrix} 5(2)+3(1) & 5(1)+3(2) \\\\ 4(2)+3(1) & 4(1)+3(2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 13 & 11 \\\\ 11 & 10 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThus, the correctly transformed components are $T'^{11}=13$, $T'^{12}=11$, $T'^{21}=11$, and $T'^{22}=10$.\n\nThe final task is to calculate the squared Frobenius norm of the violation term, $\\|P'-T'\\|_{F}^{2}$. The violation is defined by $P'^{ij}-T'^{ij}=\\delta^{ij}(\\det A)^{2}$.\nFirst, we compute the determinant of the Jacobian matrix $A_p$:\n$$\\det A_p = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (1)(1) = 3$$\nThe square of the determinant is $(\\det A_p)^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\nThe components of the violation tensor $P'^{ij}-T'^{ij}$ are:\n$P'^{11} - T'^{11} = \\delta^{11} (9) = 1 \\cdot 9 = 9$\n$P'^{12} - T'^{12} = \\delta^{12} (9) = 0 \\cdot 9 = 0$\n$P'^{21} - T'^{21} = \\delta^{21} (9) = 0 \\cdot 9 = 0$\n$P'^{22} - T'^{22} = \\delta^{22} (9) = 1 \\cdot 9 = 9$\nThe squared Frobenius norm of this violation is the sum of the squares of its components:\n$$\\|P'-T'\\|_{F}^{2} = \\sum_{i,j=1}^{2} (P'^{ij}-T'^{ij})^2 = (9)^2 + (0)^2 + (0)^2 + (9)^2$$\n$$\\|P'-T'\\|_{F}^{2} = 81 + 0 + 0 + 81 = 162$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{162}\n$$", "id": "3034075"}, {"introduction": "Beyond their transformation properties, tensors serve as multilinear maps and can be manipulated through various algebraic operations.

We are using the standard Cartesian coordinates on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$, which constitute a smooth chart.\nThe components of the tensor field $A$, $A^{i}{}_{j}(x,y,z)$, are given as:\n$A^{1}{}_{1}=x^{2}$, $A^{1}{}_{2}=yz$, $A^{1}{}_{3}=\\sin(x)$, $A^{2}{}_{1}=\\exp(y)$, $A^{2}{}_{2}=xz$, $A^{2}{}_{3}=y^{2}$, $A^{3}{}_{1}=z$, $A^{3}{}_{2}=\\cos(xy)$, $A^{3}{}_{3}=x+y+z$.\nAll of these are elementary functions (polynomials, trigonometric, exponential) which are infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$ or smooth) on their entire domain, $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\nThe components of the $1$-form $\\omega$, $\\omega_{k}(x,y,z)$, are given as:\n$\\omega_{1}=xy$, $\\omega_{2}=\\cos(z)$, $\\omega_{3}=x-yz$.\nThese are also polynomial and trigonometric functions, and thus are smooth on $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nThe components of $\\beta$ are given by $\\beta_{j} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\omega_{i} A^{i}{}_{j}$.

This means the components of $X$ are $X^{\\theta} = 0$ and $X^{\\phi} = 1$. Since these components are constants, all of their partial derivatives are zero: $\\frac{\\partial X^i}{\\partial x^k} = 0$ for all $i,k$.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula, the second and third terms vanish:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{i}{}_{j} = X^k \\frac{\\partial T^{i}{}_{j}}{\\partial x^k} - T^{k}{}_{j} (0) + T^{i}{}_{k} (0) = X^k \\frac{\\partial T^{i}{}_{j}}{\\partial x^k} $$\nExpanding the sum over $k \\in \\{\\theta, \\phi\\}$ and substituting the components of $X$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{i}{}_{j} = X^{\\theta} \\frac{\\partial T^{i}{}_{j}}{\\partial \\theta} + X^{\\phi} \\frac{\\partial T^{i}{}_{j}}{\\partial \\phi} = (0) \\frac{\\partial T^{i}{}_{j}}{\\partial \\theta} + (1) \\frac{\\partial T^{i}{}_{j}}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{\\partial T^{i}{}_{j}}{\\partial \\phi} $$\nThis demonstrates a general result: for a coordinate basis vector field $X = \\partial_k$, the components of the Lie derivative are simply the partial derivatives of the tensor components with respect to that coordinate, i.e., $(\\mathcal{L}_{\\partial_k} T)^i{}_j = \\partial_k T^i{}_j$. This calculation bypasses the need for Christoffel symbols, as they would cancel out in the full expression involving covariant derivatives.\n\nWe need to compute the $(\\theta,\\phi)$-component, which corresponds to $i=\\theta$ and $j=\\phi$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi}}{\\partial \\phi} $$\nThe problem provides the component $T^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi)$. We perform the partial differentiation:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi} \\left( \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\phi) \\right) $$\nTreating $\\sin(\\theta)$ as a constant with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$ (\\mathcal{L}_{X}T)^{\\theta}{}_{\\phi} = \\sin(\\theta) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}(\\sin(\\phi)) = \\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi) $$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi)}\n$$", "id": "3034082"}]}
