The coordinate $1$-forms $dx^{i}$ are, by definition, the exterior derivatives of these functions, $dx^{i} = d(x^{i})$. The pullback of a differential form by a smooth map is defined to commute with the exterior derivative. That is, for a smooth function $f$, the pullback of its exterior derivative $df$ is given by $\\tau^{*}(df) = d(f \\circ \\tau)$. The function $f \\circ \\tau$ is the pullback of the function $f$, denoted $\\tau^*f$.

Note that $\\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{k}}$ is shorthand for $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{x}^{i}}{\\partial y^{k}} = \\frac{\\partial(x^i \\circ \\tau)}{\\partial y^k}$.\n\nSecond equality: $dx^{i}\\!\\left(d\\tau\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{k}}$\nThe differential (or pushforward) of the map $\\tau$, denoted $d\\tau$, maps tangent vectors in the domain of $\\tau$ to tangent vectors in its codomain.

Using the duality $dx^{i}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) = \\delta^{i}_{j}$:\n$$\ndx^{i}\\!\\left(d\\tau\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^{k}}\\right)\\right) = dx^{i}\\!\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial y^{k}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial y^{k}} dx^{i}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{j}}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{j}}{\\partial y^{k}} \\delta^{i}_{j} = \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{k}}\n$$\nThis establishes the second equality. This calculation also serves as a verification of the foundational definition of the pullback of a $1$-form $\\omega$, which is $(\\tau^{*}\\omega)(v) = \\omega(d\\tau(v))$. Here, we have shown this explicitly for $\\omega = dx^i$ and $v = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^k}$.\n\nConclusion: The matrix of $\\tau^{*}$ is the transpose of the Jacobian matrix of $\\tau$.\nThe linear map $\\tau^{*}$ transforms covectors from the basis $\\{dx^{1}, dx^{2}, dx^{3}\\}$ to the basis $\\{dy^{1}, dy^{2}, dy^{3}\\}$. From Task 1, we have the transformation rule for the basis covectors:\n$$\n\\tau^{*}(dx^{i}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}} dy^{j}\n$$\nLet a covector $\\alpha$ be represented in the $x$-coordinates as $\\alpha = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} dx^{i}$. Its pullback $\\tau^{*}\\alpha$ is:\n$$\n\\tau^{*}\\alpha = \\tau^{*}\\!\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} dx^{i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} \\tau^{*}(dx^{i}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}} dy^{j}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging the summation, we express $\\tau^{*}\\alpha$ in the $y$-coordinate basis:\n$$\n\\tau^{*}\\alpha = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_{i} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}}\\right) dy^{j} = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} b_{j} dy^{j}\n$$\nThe components $b_j$ of the pulled-back covector are given by $b_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}} a_{i}$.\nThe Jacobian matrix of $\\tau$ is $J(\\tau)$ with entries $(J(\\tau))_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}}$. The transpose Jacobian, $J(\\tau)^T$, has entries $(J(\\tau)^T)_{ji} = (J(\\tau))_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial x^{i}}{\\partial y^{j}}$.\nSo, the relationship between the components can be written as $b_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (J(\\tau)^T)_{ji} a_{i}$.\nIn matrix-vector notation, if $[a]$ is the column vector of components $(a_1, a_2, a_3)^T$ and $[b]$ is the column vector of components $(b_1, b_2, b_3)^T$, then $[b] = J(\\tau)^T [a]$.\nThe matrix that transforms the coordinate vector of a covector is the matrix of the linear transformation. Therefore, the matrix of $\\tau^{*}$ with respect to the bases $\\{dx^i\\}$ and $\\{dy^j\\}$ is $J(\\tau)^T$, the transpose of the Jacobian matrix of $\\tau$.\n\n### Task 3: Evaluation of a Coefficient\n\nWe need to find the value of the coefficient of $dy^{2}$ in the $1$-form $\\tau^{*}(dx^{3})$ at the point $y_{0} = (2,-1,0)$.\nFrom Task 1, the expression for $\\tau^{*}(dx^{3})$ is:\n$$\n\\tau^{*}(dx^{3}) = y^{2} dy^{1} + y^{1} dy^{2} + \\frac{2y^{3}}{1+(y^{3})^{2}} dy^{3}\n$$\nThe coefficient of the $1$-form $dy^{2}$ is the function $f(y) = y^{1}$.\nWe are asked to evaluate this coefficient at the point $y_{0} = (y_{0}^{1}, y_{0}^{2}, y_{0}^{3}) = (2, -1, 0)$.\nSubstituting the coordinates of $y_{0}$ into the coefficient function, we get:\n$$\nf(y_0) = y_{0}^{1} = 2\n$$\nThe value of the coefficient is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3034691"}, {"introduction": "The generalized Stokes' theorem, $\\int_M d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial M} \\omega$, is a cornerstone of differential geometry, unifying the fundamental theorems of vector calculus into a single, elegant statement.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks us to perform Cartan's test for involutivity for a given linear Pfaffian system $\\mathcal{I}$ on the manifold $M = \\mathbb{R}^{7}$. The system is defined by a set of $1$-forms and an independence condition.\n\nThe given $1$-forms are:\n- The ideal generators for the Pfaffian system $\\mathcal{I}$:\n  $$ \\omega^{1} = dz^{1} - u^{1}\\,dx^{1} - u^{2}\\,dx^{2} $$\n  $$ \\omega^{2} = dz^{2} - u^{2}\\,dx^{1} - u^{3}\\,dx^{2} $$\n- The independence forms, defining $2$-dimensional integral manifolds:\n  $$ \\eta^{1} = dx^{1}, \\quad \\eta^{2} = dx^{2} $$\n  The independence condition is $\\eta^{1} \\wedge \\eta^{2} \\neq 0$.\n- The free (or fiber) $1$-forms:\n  $$ \\pi^{1} = du^{1}, \\quad \\pi^{2} = du^{2}, \\quad \\pi^{3} = du^{3} $$\n\nThe dimension of the base manifold of integral manifolds is $p=2$. The number of equations in the Pfaffian system is $q=2$. The number of free $1$-forms is $m=3$. The total dimension of the manifold is $N=7 = p+q+m$.\n\nCartan's test for involutivity requires analyzing the exterior derivatives of the ideal generators, $d\\omega^1$ and $d\\omega^2$. We compute these as follows:\n$$ d\\omega^{1} = d(dz^{1} - u^{1}\\,dx^{1} - u^{2}\\,dx^{2}) = -du^{1} \\wedge dx^{1} - u^{1}\\,d(dx^{1}) - du^{2} \\wedge dx^{2} - u^{2}\\,d(dx^{2}) $$\nSince $d(dx^{i}) = 0$, we have:\n$$ d\\omega^{1} = -du^{1} \\wedge dx^{1} - du^{2} \\wedge dx^{2} $$\nIn terms of the given forms $\\eta^i$ and $\\pi^j$:\n$$ d\\omega^{1} = -\\pi^{1} \\wedge \\eta^{1} - \\pi^{2} \\wedge \\eta^{2} = \\eta^{1} \\wedge \\pi^{1} + \\eta^{2} \\wedge \\pi^{2} $$\nSimilarly, for $\\omega^2$:\n$$ d\\omega^{2} = d(dz^{2} - u^{2}\\,dx^{1} - u^{3}\\,dx^{2}) = -du^{2} \\wedge dx^{1} - du^{3} \\wedge dx^{2} $$\nIn terms of the given forms:\n$$ d\\omega^{2} = -\\pi^{2} \\wedge \\eta^{1} - \\pi^{3} \\wedge \\eta^{2} = \\eta^{1} \\wedge \\pi^{2} + \\eta^{2} \\wedge \\pi^{3} $$\n\nThese exterior derivatives must vanish when restricted to any integral manifold. Modulo the ideal $\\mathcal{I}$ itself, we have the relations:\n$$ d\\omega^{1} \\equiv \\eta^{1} \\wedge \\pi^{1} + \\eta^{2} \\wedge \\pi^{2} \\pmod{\\mathcal{I}} $$\n$$ d\\omega^{2} \\equiv \\eta^{1} \\wedge \\pi^{2} + \\eta^{2} \\wedge \\pi^{3} \\pmod{\\mathcal{I}} $$\n\nFrom these expressions, we construct the tableau. The tableau consists of matrices $A_i$ whose entries $A^a_{i\\alpha}$ are the coefficients of the free forms $\\pi^\\alpha$ in the expression for $d\\omega^a$. The general form is $d\\omega^a \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^p \\eta^i \\wedge \\left(\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^m A^a_{i\\alpha} \\pi^\\alpha\\right)$.\n\nFor our system, we identify the tableau matrices $A_1$ (coefficients for $\\eta^1$) and $A_2$ (coefficients for $\\eta^2$).\nFrom $d\\omega^1$: The terms multiplying $\\eta^1$ give the first row of $A_1$, and terms multiplying $\\eta^2$ give the first row of $A_2$.\n- $d\\omega^1 = \\eta^1 \\wedge (1\\cdot\\pi^1 + 0\\cdot\\pi^2 + 0\\cdot\\pi^3) + \\eta^2 \\wedge (0\\cdot\\pi^1 + 1\\cdot\\pi^2 + 0\\cdot\\pi^3)$.\nFrom $d\\omega^2$: The terms multiplying $\\eta^1$ give the second row of $A_1$, and terms multiplying $\\eta^2$ give the second row of $A_2$.\n- $d\\omega^2 = \\eta^1 \\wedge (0\\cdot\\pi^1 + 1\\cdot\\pi^2 + 0\\cdot\\pi^3) + \\eta^2 \\wedge (0\\cdot\\pi^1 + 0\\cdot\\pi^2 + 1\\cdot\\pi^3)$.\n\nThe resulting tableau matrices are:\n$$ A_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**1. Compute the Cartan characters $s_1$ and $s_2$.**\nThe problem specifies computing the characters corresponding to the independence pair $(\\eta^1, \\eta^2)$, which defines a flag of subspaces in the space of independence forms.\nThe first Cartan character, $s_1$, is the rank of the first tableau matrix, $A_1$.\n$$ s_1 = \\text{rank}(A_1) = \\text{rank}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 $$\nThe second Cartan character, $s_2$, is the rank of the second tableau matrix, $A_2$, when restricted to the kernel of the first matrix, $A_1$.\nFirst, we find the kernel of $A_1$. We seek vectors $v = (v_1, v_2, v_3)^T$ such that $A_1 v = 0$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ v_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies v_1=0, v_2=0 $$\nThe kernel of $A_1$ is the subspace spanned by the vector $(0, 0, 1)^T$.\n$$ \\ker(A_1) = \\text{span}\\left\\{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\right\\} $$\nNow, we apply $A_2$ to this kernel and find the dimension of the resulting image space. Let $k_1 = (0, 0, 1)^T$:\n$$ A_2 k_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe image is spanned by a non-zero vector, so its dimension is $1$.\n$$ s_2 = \\text{rank}(A_2|_{\\ker(A_1)}) = 1 $$\nThe Cartan characters are $s_1 = 2$ and $s_2 = 1$.\n\n**2. Compute the dimension of the first prolongation and the Cartan test sum.**\nThe Cartan test sum for a system with $p=2$ independent variables is $s_1 + 2s_2$.\n$$ s_1 + 2s_2 = 2 + 2(1) = 4 $$\nTo decide on involutivity, this sum must be compared to the dimension $g_2$ of the space of solutions to the first prolongation of the tableau equations. The tableau equations constrain the first-order jet variables $p^\\alpha_i = \\frac{\\partial u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i}$. These equations are given by the relations derived from $d\\mathcal{I}$. For a 2-dimensional integral element, we have $\\pi^\\alpha = p^\\alpha_1 \\eta^1 + p^\\alpha_2 \\eta^2$. Substituting this into the expressions for $d\\omega^a$ gives:\n$$ (p^1_2 - p^2_1)\\eta^1 \\wedge \\eta^2 = 0 \\implies p^1_2 = p^2_1 $$\n$$ (p^2_2 - p^3_1)\\eta^1 \\wedge \\eta^2 = 0 \\implies p^2_2 = p^3_1 $$\nThe first prolongation concerns the second-order jet variables $p^\\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u^\\alpha}{\\partial x^i \\partial x^j}$, which are symmetric in $i,j$. Differentiating the tableau equations with respect to $x^1$ and $x^2$ yields the prolonged system:\n- $\\partial_{x^1}(p^1_2 = p^2_1) \\implies p^1_{21} = p^2_{11} \\implies p^1_{12} = p^2_{11}$\n- $\\partial_{x^2}(p^1_2 = p^2_1) \\implies p^1_{22} = p^2_{12}$\n- $\\partial_{x^1}(p^2_2 = p^3_1) \\implies p^2_{21} = p^3_{11} \\implies p^2_{12} = p^3_{11}$\n- $\\partial_{x^2}(p^2_2 = p^3_1) \\implies p^2_{22} = p^3_{12}$\nWe have $m=3$ functions $u^\\alpha$ and $p=2$ variables $x^i$. The number of symmetric second-order jet variables $p^\\alpha_{ij}$ is $m \\times \\binom{p+2-1}{p} = 3 \\times \\binom{3}{2} = 9$. The prolonged system gives 4 independent linear equations on these 9 variables. The dimension of the solution space for the second-order jets, denoted $g_2$, is therefore:\n$g_2 = (\\text{number of variables}) - (\\text{number of independent equations}) = 9 - 4 = 5$.\n\n**3. Decide on involutivity.**\nCartan's test states that the system is involutive if and only if $g_2 = s_1 + 2s_2$.\nIn our case, we have $g_2 = 5$ and $s_1 + 2s_2 = 4$.\nSince $g_2 \\neq s_1 + 2s_2$, the system is not involutive with respect to the given independence condition. The existence and generality of solutions are therefore not guaranteed by the Cartan-Kähler theorem.\n\nThe problem asks for the row matrix $(s_1, s_2, s_1 + 2s_2)$. Based on our calculations, this is $(2, 1, 4)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3034692"}]}
