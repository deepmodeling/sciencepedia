It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the general framework. Let $M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be a smooth $m$-dimensional submanifold, with $1 \\leq m < n$. It is given locally as the graph of a smooth map $h \\colon U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n-m}$ where $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is an open set. A local parametrization is given by $F \\colon U \\to \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, defined as $F(x) = (x, h(x))$, where $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_m)$.\n\nThe tangent space $T_p M$ at a point $p = F(x_0)$ for some $x_0 \\in U$ is defined as the image of the differential of $F$ at $x_0$, denoted $DF_{x_0}$. The differential is a linear map $DF_{x_0} \\colon T_{x_0}\\mathbb{R}^m \\to T_p\\mathbb{R}^n$. In the standard coordinate bases, $T_{x_0}\\mathbb{R}^m \\cong \\mathbb{R}^m$ and $T_p\\mathbb{R}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$. The matrix representation of $DF_{x_0}$ is the $n \\times m$ Jacobian matrix of $F$ evaluated at $x_0$, whose columns are the partial derivatives of $F$ with respect to the coordinates $x_i$:\n$$\nDF(x_0) = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_1}\\bigg|_{x_0} \\quad \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_2}\\bigg|_{x_0} \\quad \\cdots \\quad \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_m}\\bigg|_{x_0} \\right]\n$$\nThe component functions of $F$ are $(F_1, \\dots, F_n) = (x_1, \\dots, x_m, h_1(x), \\dots, h_{n-m}(x))$. The $j$-th column vector is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x_j} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial x_j}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial x_m}{\\partial x_j}, \\frac{\\partial h_1}{\\partial x_j}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial h_{n-m}}{\\partial x_j} \\right)^T = (0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0, \\frac{\\partial h_1}{\\partial x_j}, \\dots, \\frac{\\partial h_{n-m}}{\\partial x_j})^T\n$$\nwhere the $1$ is in the $j$-th position. These $m$ column vectors are manifestly linearly independent, as the submatrix formed by their first $m$ rows is the $m \\times m$ identity matrix. The tangent space $T_p M$ is the span of these vectors.

That is, for all $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$:\n$$\\gamma(t)^{T} \\gamma(t) = I$$\nThis is an equation between matrix-valued functions of $t$. We can differentiate both sides with respect to $t$. The right-hand side is the constant identity matrix, so its derivative is the zero matrix, $0$. For the left-hand side, we apply the product rule for matrix multiplication (which is a consequence of the chain rule applied to the bilinear map of matrix multiplication):\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\gamma(t)^{T} \\gamma(t) \\right) = \\left( \\frac{d}{dt} \\gamma(t)^{T} \\right) \\gamma(t) + \\gamma(t)^{T} \\left( \\frac{d}{dt} \\gamma(t) \\right) = 0$$\nThe derivative of the transpose is the transpose of the derivative, so $\\frac{d}{dt} \\gamma(t)^{T} = (\\gamma'(t))^{T}$. The equation becomes:\n$$(\\gamma'(t))^{T} \\gamma(t) + \\gamma(t)^{T} \\gamma'(t) = 0$$\nThis equation holds for all $t \\in (-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$. To find the condition on the tangent vector $V$ at the point $I$, we evaluate this equation at $t=0$. We have $\\gamma(0) = I$ and $\\gamma'(0) = V$.

At $t=0$, we have $\\gamma'(0) = V\\exp(0) = V \\cdot I = V$. This is also satisfied.\n3.  **Curve lies in $O(n)$**:\n    We need to check if $\\gamma(t)^{T}\\gamma(t) = I$ for all $t$.\n    Using properties of the matrix exponential, $(\\exp(B))^T = \\exp(B^T)$.\n    $$\\gamma(t)^{T} = (\\exp(tV))^{T} = \\exp((tV)^{T}) = \\exp(tV^{T})$$\n    Since $V$ is skew-symmetric, $V^{T} = -V$.

We substitute $\\alpha(0) = A$ and $\\alpha'(0) = X$:\n$$X^{T} A + A^{T} X = 0$$\nThis is the linear equation that any tangent vector $X \\in T_{A}O(n)$ must satisfy. This shows that $T_A O(n)$ is a subset of the matrices satisfying this condition.\n\nTo prove the reverse inclusion, we must show that for any matrix $X \\in M_n(\\mathbb{R})$ satisfying $X^T A + A^T X = 0$, there exists a curve $\\alpha(t)$ in $O(n)$ with $\\alpha(0)=A$ and $\\alpha'(0)=X$.\nLet $X$ be a matrix such that $X^T A + A^T X = 0$.

Let us check if $V$ is skew-symmetric:\n$$V^T + V = (A^T X)^T + A^T X = X^T (A^T)^T + A^T X = X^T A + A^T X$$\nBy our assumption on $X$, this is equal to the zero matrix. So, $V^T + V = 0$, which means $V = A^T X$ is a skew-symmetric matrix.\n\nNow, we construct the curve. A natural way to do this is by left-translation of a curve starting at the identity. We know that if $V$ is a skew-symmetric matrix, then $\\gamma(t) = \\exp(tV)$ is a curve in $O(n)$ with $\\gamma(0)=I$ and $\\gamma'(0)=V$.\nLet's define a new curve $\\alpha(t)$ by left-multiplying by $A$:\n$$\\alpha(t) = A \\gamma(t) = A \\exp(tV) = A \\exp(t A^T X)$$\nLet's verify the properties of this curve:\n1.  **Curve passes through $A$ at $t=0$**:\n    $\\alpha(0) = A\\exp(0) = AI = A$. This is satisfied.\n2.  **Velocity at $t=0$ is $X$**:\n    Using the product rule (or linearity of differentiation), $\\alpha'(t) = A \\frac{d}{dt}(\\exp(t A^T X)) = A(A^T X)\\exp(t A^T X)$.\n    At $t=0$, $\\alpha'(0) = A(A^T X)\\exp(0) = (A A^T) X$.\n    Since $A \\in O(n)$, we have $A^T A = I$. This implies $A$ is invertible with $A^{-1}=A^T$. Therefore, $A A^T = A A^{-1} = I$.\n    So, $\\alpha'(0) = I X = X$. This is satisfied.\n3.  **Curve lies in $O(n)$**:\n    Since $A \\in O(n)$ and $\\gamma(t) = \\exp(tV) \\in O(n)$, their product is also in $O(n)$:\n    $$(\\alpha(t))^T \\alpha(t) = (A\\gamma(t))^T (A\\gamma(t)) = \\gamma(t)^T A^T A \\gamma(t) = \\gamma(t)^T I \\gamma(t) = \\gamma(t)^T \\gamma(t) = I$$\n    This is satisfied.\n\nThis construction shows that any matrix $X$ satisfying the condition $X^T A + A^T X = 0$ is a tangent vector in $T_A O(n)$.\nTherefore, the tangent space at a general point $A \\in O(n)$ is precisely the set of matrices satisfying this linear equation:\n$$T_{A}O(n) = \\{ X \\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{R}) \\mid X^{T} A + A^{T} X = 0 \\}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\{ V \\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{R}) \\mid V^{T} + V = 0 \\} & \\{ X \\in M_{n}(\\mathbb{R}) \\mid X^{T} A + A^{T} X = 0 \\}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3034021"}, {"introduction": "Building upon our understanding of the Lie algebra, this final practice investigates how the group structure provides a canonical way to relate tangent spaces at different points.

We use the same tangent vector $v = hX \\in T_{h}G$ and its representative curve $\\gamma(t) = h \\exp(tX)$.\nBy definition, $d(R_{g})_{h}(hX)$ is the tangent vector at $t=0$ to the curve $\\beta(t) = R_{g}(\\gamma(t))$.\nWe have $\\beta(t) = \\gamma(t) g = (h \\exp(tX)) g$.\nTo find the tangent vector, we differentiate with respect to $t$ using the product rule for matrix-valued functions, $(A(t)B(t))' = A'(t)B(t) + A(t)B'(t)$. Here, $A(t) = h \\exp(tX)$ and $B(t)=g$ is a constant matrix.\n$$ \\beta'(t) = \\left( \\frac{d}{dt} [h \\exp(tX)] \\right) g + (h \\exp(tX)) \\left( \\frac{d}{dt} g \\right) $$\nThe derivative of the constant matrix $g$ is the zero matrix. The derivative of the first term is $h (X \\exp(tX))$.\n$$ \\beta'(t) = (h X \\exp(tX)) g + 0 = hX \\exp(tX) g $$\nEvaluating at $t=0$:\n$$ \\beta'(0) = hX \\exp(0) g = hXg $$\nThus, the expression for the differential of the right translation is:\n$$ d(R_{g})_{h}(hX) = hXg $$\n\n**3. Proof of Isomorphism Property**\n\nTo show that $d(L_{g})_{h}$ and $d(R_{g})_{h}$ are linear isomorphisms, we first confirm they are linear maps and then show they are invertible.\n\nLinearity: The space of tangent vectors $T_{h}G$ is a vector space, identified with $\\{hX \\mid X \\in \\mathfrak{g}\\}$. For any scalars $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and vectors $hX_1, hX_2 \\in T_h G$, their linear combination is $a(hX_1) + b(hX_2) = h(aX_1 + bX_2)$, where we use the vector space structure of $M_n(\\mathbb{R})$.\nFor $d(L_g)_h$:\n$d(L_g)_h(a(hX_1)+b(hX_2)) = d(L_g)_h(h(aX_1+bX_2)) = (gh)(aX_1+bX_2) = a(gh)X_1 + b(gh)X_2 = a \\, d(L_g)_h(hX_1) + b \\, d(L_g)_h(hX_2)$.\nFor $d(R_g)_h$:\n$d(R_g)_h(a(hX_1)+b(hX_2)) = d(R_g)_h(h(aX_1+bX_2)) = h(aX_1+bX_2)g = a(hX_1g) + b(hX_2g) = a \\, d(R_g)_h(hX_1) + b \\, d(R_g)_h(hX_2)$.\nBoth maps are linear.\n\nInvertibility: A linear map between finite-dimensional vector spaces of the same dimension is an isomorphism if and only if it is invertible. We can prove invertibility by explicitly constructing the inverse using the properties of diffeomorphisms.\n\nThe maps $L_g \\colon G \\to G$ and $R_g \\colon G \\to G$ are smooth. Since $G$ is a group, for any $g \\in G$, its inverse $g^{-1}$ is also in $G$. The maps $L_{g^{-1}}$ and $R_{g^{-1}}$ are the inverse maps to $L_g$ and $R_g$, respectively:\n$L_{g^{-1}} \\circ L_g = \\mathrm{Id}_G$ and $R_{g^{-1}} \\circ R_g = \\mathrm{Id}_G$.\nSince both a map and its inverse are smooth, $L_g$ and $R_g$ are diffeomorphisms for any $g \\in G$.\n\nWe use the chain rule for differentials, which states that for smooth maps $\\Phi_1, \\Phi_2$, we have $d(\\Phi_2 \\circ \\Phi_1)_p = d(\\Phi_2)_{\\Phi_1(p)} \\circ d(\\Phi_1)_p$.\n\nFor left translation, we apply the chain rule to $L_{g^{-1}} \\circ L_g = \\mathrm{Id}_G$ at the point $h \\in G$:\n$$ d(\\mathrm{Id}_G)_h = d(L_{g^{-1}} \\circ L_g)_h = d(L_{g^{-1}})_{L_g(h)} \\circ d(L_g)_h $$\nThe differential of the identity map is the identity operator on the tangent space, so $d(\\mathrm{Id}_G)_h = \\mathrm{Id}_{T_hG}$. Also, $L_g(h)=gh$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Id}_{T_hG} = d(L_{g^{-1}})_{gh} \\circ d(L_g)_h $$\nThis equation shows that the linear map $d(L_g)_h$ has an inverse, which is given by $(d(L_g)_h)^{-1} = d(L_{g^{-1}})_{gh}$. Being invertible, $d(L_g)_h$ is a linear isomorphism from $T_hG$ to $T_{gh}G$.\n\nFor right translation, the argument is analogous. We apply the chain rule to $R_{g^{-1}} \\circ R_g = \\mathrm{Id}_G$ at $h \\in G$:\n$$ d(\\mathrm{Id}_G)_h = d(R_{g^{-1}} \\circ R_g)_h = d(R_{g^{-1}})_{R_g(h)} \\circ d(R_g)_h $$\nWith $d(\\mathrm{Id}_G)_h = \\mathrm{Id}_{T_hG}$ and $R_g(h)=hg$, we get:\n$$ \\mathrm{Id}_{T_hG} = d(R_{g^{-1}})_{hg} \\circ d(R_g)_h $$\nThis shows that $(d(R_g)_h)^{-1} = d(R_{g^{-1}})_{hg}$. Therefore, $d(R_g)_h$ is a linear isomorphism from $T_hG$ to $T_{hg}G$.\n\nWe have thus derived the explicit formulas for the differentials and shown that they are linear isomorphisms.\nThe final computed formulas are $d(L_{g})_{h}(hX) = (gh)X$ and $d(R_{g})_{h}(hX) = hXg$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} (gh)X & hXg \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3034016"}]}
