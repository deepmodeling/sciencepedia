This local resemblance is formalized through the concept of charts. A chart on a manifold $M$ is a pair $(U, \\phi)$, where $U$ is an open subset of $M$ and $\\phi: U \\to V$ is a homeomorphism from $U$ to an open subset $V$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$. A collection of charts that covers the entire manifold, i.e., $\\bigcup_i U_i = M$, is called an atlas.\n\nConsider the 2-torus, $T^2$, which can be visualized as the surface of a doughnut. Topologically, it is defined as the product space $S^1 \\times S^1$, where $S^1$ is the unit circle. It is a well-known result that the 2-torus is a smooth 2-manifold but that a single chart is insufficient to form a complete atlas for it.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct and most fundamental reason for this fact?\n\nA. The 2-torus is a compact topological space. Any chart must map it homeomorphically to an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. However, a non-empty open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ cannot be compact, and a homeomorphism must preserve the property of compactness. This leads to a contradiction.\n\nB. The 2-torus is not simply connected, meaning it has \"holes\". Any chart must map to an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, all of which are simply connected. A homeomorphism must preserve simple-connectedness, so a non-simply connected space cannot be mapped to a simply connected one.\n\nC. The 2-torus is an orientable surface. A single chart would define a global orientation, but for a surface with non-trivial topology like the torus, a global orientation can only be consistently defined by checking the compatibility of at least two overlapping charts.\n\nD. The standard flat metric on the 2-torus gives it zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. Any chart covering the whole torus would have to be an isometry to an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (which is also flat). However, no such global isometry exists because the torus is a finite-volume space while any open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ has infinite volume.\n\nE. The 2-torus is a manifold without a boundary. A chart would map the entire torus to an open set $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$.

The chart domains cover $M$.\n2.  Each chart is a homeomorphism from its domain onto an open subset of either $H^1$ or $\\mathbb{R}$.\n3.

Since $\\tfrac{2}{5} < \\tfrac{3}{5}$, this union is $[0,1] = M$. Thus, the manifold $M$ is covered by the chart domains.\n\n**Condition 2: Homeomorphisms to Open Sets**\n-   For $\\varphi_{0}$, the domain is $U_{0} = [0, \\tfrac{3}{5})$. The map $\\varphi_{0}(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is a homeomorphism onto its image $\\varphi_{0}(U_{0}) = [0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$. This image is an open set in $H^1$ since it can be written as $(-\\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}}, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}}) \\cap H^1$.\n-   For $\\varphi_{c}$, the domain is $U_{c} = (0,1)$. The map $\\varphi_{c}(x) = x$ is a homeomorphism onto its image $\\varphi_{c}(U_{c}) = (0,1)$, which is an open set in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n-   For $\\varphi_{1}$, the domain is $U_{1} = (\\tfrac{2}{5}, 1]$. The map $\\varphi_{1}(x) = \\sqrt{1 - x}$ is a homeomorphism onto its image $\\varphi_{1}(U_{1}) = [0, \\sqrt{1 - \\tfrac{2}{5}}) = [0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$. This is also an open set in $H^1$.\n\n**Condition 3: Smoothness of Transition Maps**\nWe must check the transition maps on all non-empty intersections of the chart domains.\n\n-   **Overlap $U_{0c} = U_{0} \\cap U_{c} = (0, \\tfrac{3}{5})$**:\n    -   The transition map $\\tau_{0c} = \\varphi_{c} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1}$ is defined on $\\varphi_{0}(U_{0c}) = (\\sqrt{0}, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}}) = (0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$. For $y \\in (0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$, we have $\\varphi_{0}^{-1}(y) = y^2$. Thus, $\\tau_{0c}(y) = \\varphi_{c}(y^2) = y^2$. The function $f(y) = y^2$ is a polynomial and therefore smooth ($C^{\\infty}$) on its entire domain $\\mathbb{R}$, so it is smooth on $(0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$.\n    -   The transition map $\\tau_{c0} = \\varphi_{0} \\circ \\varphi_{c}^{-1}$ is defined on $\\varphi_{c}(U_{0c}) = (0, \\tfrac{3}{5})$. For $x \\in (0, \\tfrac{3}{5})$, we have $\\varphi_{c}^{-1}(x) = x$. Thus, $\\tau_{c0}(x) = \\varphi_{0}(x) = \\sqrt{x}$. The function $g(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is smooth on the open interval $(0, \\tfrac{3}{5})$.\n\n-   **Overlap $U_{c1} = U_{c} \\cap U_{1} = (\\tfrac{2}{5}, 1)$**:\n    -   The transition map $\\tau_{c1} = \\varphi_{1} \\circ \\varphi_{c}^{-1}$ is defined on $\\varphi_{c}(U_{c1}) = (\\tfrac{2}{5}, 1)$. For $x \\in (\\tfrac{2}{5}, 1)$, $\\varphi_{c}^{-1}(x) = x$. Thus, $\\tau_{c1}(x) = \\varphi_{1}(x) = \\sqrt{1-x}$. This function is smooth on $(\\tfrac{2}{5}, 1)$ since $1-x > 0$ on this interval.\n    -   The transition map $\\tau_{1c} = \\varphi_{c} \\circ \\varphi_{1}^{-1}$ is defined on $\\varphi_{1}(U_{c1})$. If $x \\in (\\tfrac{2}{5}, 1)$, then $1-x \\in (0, \\tfrac{3}{5})$, so $\\sqrt{1-x} \\in (0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$. The domain is $(0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$. For $y \\in (0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$, $\\varphi_{1}^{-1}(y)$ is the value $x$ such that $\\sqrt{1-x}=y$, which gives $1-x = y^2$, or $x=1-y^2$. Thus, $\\tau_{1c}(y) = \\varphi_{c}(1-y^2) = 1-y^2$.

For $y \\in (\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{5}}, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$, $\\varphi_{0}^{-1}(y) = y^2$. Thus, $\\tau_{01}(y) = \\varphi_{1}(y^2) = \\sqrt{1-y^2}$. This function is smooth on the given domain, as $1-y^2 > 1 - \\tfrac{3}{5} = \\tfrac{2}{5} > 0$.\n    -   The transition map $\\tau_{10} = \\varphi_{0} \\circ \\varphi_{1}^{-1}$ is defined on $\\varphi_{1}(U_{01}) = (\\sqrt{1-\\tfrac{3}{5}}, \\sqrt{1-\\tfrac{2}{5}}) = (\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{5}}, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$. For $z \\in (\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{5}}, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$, $\\varphi_{1}^{-1}(z) = 1-z^2$. Thus, $\\tau_{10}(z) = \\varphi_{0}(1-z^2) = \\sqrt{1-z^2}$. This function is identical to $\\tau_{01}$ and is smooth on its domain.\n\nAll transition maps are smooth functions on their respective domains, which are open subsets of $\\mathbb{R}$. The definition of smoothness for a manifold with boundary requires that these maps extend smoothly. Since the domains are already open in $\\mathbb{R}$ and the functions are smooth on them, this condition is satisfied. Therefore, the given charts form a smooth atlas for $M$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Second Derivative**\n\nWe are asked to compute the second derivative at $0$ of the smooth extension of the transition map $\\tau_{0c} = \\varphi_{c} \\circ \\varphi_{0}^{-1}$.\n\nFrom Part 1, the map $\\tau_{0c}$ is defined on the domain $\\varphi_{0}(U_{0} \\cap U_{c}) = (0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}})$ and is given by the formula:\n$$ \\tau_{0c}(y) = y^2, \\quad \\text{for } y \\in (0, \\sqrt{\\tfrac{3}{5}}) $$\nThe problem requires us to consider a smooth function $\\tilde{\\tau}_{0c}$, defined on an open neighborhood of $0$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ (e.g., $(-\\epsilon, \\epsilon)$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$), which serves as an extension of $\\tau_{0c}$. This means $\\tilde{\\tau}_{0c}(y) = \\tau_{0c}(y) = y^2$ for $y \\in (0, \\epsilon)$.\n\nFor $\\tilde{\\tau}_{0c}$ to be smooth (specifically, $C^2$) at $y=0$, its derivatives at $y=0$ must exist. These derivatives are determined by the behavior of the function as $y$ approaches $0$.\n\nThe value of the function at $0$ must be the limit from the right:\n$$ \\tilde{\\tau}_{0c}(0) = \\lim_{y \\to 0^+} \\tau_{0c}(y) = \\lim_{y \\to 0^+} y^2 = 0 $$\nThe first derivative of $\\tau_{0c}$ for $y > 0$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dy}\\tau_{0c}(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}(y^2) = 2y $$\nThe first derivative of the extension at $y=0$ must be the limit of the derivative as $y \\to 0^+$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\tau}_{0c}'(0) = \\lim_{y \\to 0^+} (2y) = 0 $$\nThe second derivative of $\\tau_{0c}$ for $y > 0$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2}{dy^2}\\tau_{0c}(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}(2y) = 2 $$\nThe second derivative of the extension at $y=0$ must be the limit of the second derivative as $y \\to 0^+$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\tau}_{0c}''(0) = \\lim_{y \\to 0^+} (2) = 2 $$\nThis shows that any $C^2$ extension of $\\tau_{0c}$ must have a second derivative equal to $2$ at $y=0$. The \"unique smooth extension\" mentioned in the problem can be taken as the most natural one, $F(y) = y^2$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which is analytic. For this extension, $F''(y) = 2$ for all $y$, and in particular $F''(0) = 2$.\n\nThe final answer is the value of this second derivative.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3027674"}]}
