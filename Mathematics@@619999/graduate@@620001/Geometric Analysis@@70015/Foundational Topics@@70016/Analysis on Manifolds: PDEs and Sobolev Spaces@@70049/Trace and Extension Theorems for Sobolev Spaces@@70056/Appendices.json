No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the boundary geometry of the domain $\\Omega_{\\alpha}$ near the origin and its consequences for Sobolev spaces.\n\n**Part 1: Boundary Representation**\n\nThe domain is given by $\\Omega_{\\alpha}=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}:yx^{\\alpha},\\ 0x1\\}\\cap B_{1}(0)$. The boundary $\\partial\\Omega_{\\alpha}$ is composed of portions of the curve $y=x^{\\alpha}$, the circle $x^2+y^2=1$, and the coordinate axes. We are interested in the geometry near the origin $(0,0)$. For any sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin, the condition $(x,y) \\in B_{1}(0)$ is automatically satisfied. Thus, locally near $(0,0)$, the domain is characterized by the inequalities $yx^{\\alpha}$ and $x0$.\n\nThe boundary of this local domain consists of two parts meeting at the origin:\n1.  The curve $\\Gamma_{1} = \\{(x,y) : y=x^{\\alpha}, x0\\}$.\n2.  The line segment $\\Gamma_{2} = \\{(x,y) : x=0, y0\\}$.\n\nThe problem asks to represent the boundary using a function of the form $x=\\phi(y)$. This representation focuses on the shape of the curved part of the boundary, $\\Gamma_{1}$. For a point $(x,y)$ on this curve, with $x0$ and $y0$, the relation $y=x^{\\alpha}$ can be inverted to yield $x = y^{1/\\alpha}$. This inversion is single-valued because $x0$. Thus, for a sufficiently small $\\delta0$, the curved portion of the boundary in the neighborhood $\\{(x,y): 0y\\delta\\}$ can indeed be represented as the graph of the function $x=\\phi(y)$ where $\\phi(y)=y^{1/\\alpha}$ for $y \\in (0, \\delta)$. This function describes the shape of the cusp.\n\n**Part 2: Hölder Continuity and the Lipschitz Condition**\n\nA function $\\phi$ defined on an interval $I$ is Hölder continuous of order $\\beta \\in (0,1]$ if there exists a constant $C0$ such that for all $y,z \\in I$, the inequality $|\\phi(y)-\\phi(z)| \\le C|y-z|^{\\beta}$ holds.\n\nWe analyze the function $\\phi(y) = y^{1/\\alpha}$ for $y \\in [0, \\delta)$. To find the optimal (largest) Hölder exponent at the origin, we can set $z=0$. The condition becomes $|\\phi(y)-\\phi(0)| \\le C|y-0|^{\\beta}$, which simplifies to $|y^{1/\\alpha} - 0| \\le C|y|^{\\beta}$, or $y^{1/\\alpha} \\le C y^{\\beta}$ for $y0$. This is equivalent to $y^{1/\\alpha - \\beta} \\le C$. For this inequality to hold for all $y$ in a neighborhood of $0$, the exponent must be non-negative: $1/\\alpha - \\beta \\ge 0$, which implies $\\beta \\le 1/\\alpha$. This shows that the largest possible Hölder exponent is $\\beta(\\alpha) = 1/\\alpha$.\n\nWe must confirm that $\\phi(y)=y^{1/\\alpha}$ is indeed Hölder continuous with exponent $1/\\alpha$. We need to show that there exists a constant $C0$ such that $|y^{1/\\alpha} - z^{1/\\alpha}| \\le C|y-z|^{1/\\alpha}$ for all $y,z \\in [0, \\delta)$.\nLet $p=1/\\alpha$. Since $\\alpha1$, we have $0p1$. The function $f(t)=t^p$ is concave on $[0, \\infty)$ because its second derivative, $f''(t) = p(p-1)t^{p-2}$, is negative for $t0$. For a concave function $f$ with $f(0)=0$, it is a standard result that $f(a+b) \\le f(a)+f(b)$ (subadditivity). Also, for $yz\\ge0$, we have $y^p - z^p \\le (y-z)^p$. To see this, let $y = u+z$. We need to show $(u+z)^p - z^p \\le u^p$. Let $g(z) = u^p - (u+z)^p + z^p$. $g(0) = u^p - u^p + 0 = 0$. The derivative is $g'(z) = -p(u+z)^{p-1} + pz^{p-1} = p(z^{p-1} - (u+z)^{p-1})$. Since $p-10$, the function $t \\mapsto t^{p-1}$ is decreasing. Thus, for $z0$ and $u0$, we have $z  u+z$, which implies $z^{p-1}  (u+z)^{p-1}$. So $g'(z)0$, meaning $g(z) \\ge 0$ for $z\\ge 0$. The inequality $y^p - z^p \\le (y-z)^p$ is established.\nTaking absolute values, we have $|y^{1/\\alpha}-z^{1/\\alpha}| \\le |y-z|^{1/\\alpha}$. This confirms that $\\phi(y)$ is Hölder continuous with exponent $\\beta(\\alpha)=1/\\alpha$ and constant $C=1$.\n\nA function $\\phi$ is Lipschitz continuous if it is Hölder continuous with exponent $\\beta=1$. That is, there exists a constant $L0$ such that $|\\phi(y)-\\phi(z)| \\le L|y-z|$ for all $y,z$.\nOur function is $\\phi(y) = y^{1/\\alpha}$. Its optimal Hölder exponent is $\\beta(\\alpha)=1/\\alpha$. Since the problem states $\\alpha1$, we have $0  1/\\alpha  1$. Because the optimal Hölder exponent is strictly less than $1$, the function $\\phi(y)$ is not Lipschitz continuous on any interval containing the origin.\nAlternatively, one can consider the derivative $\\phi'(y) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}y^{1/\\alpha - 1}$. As $y \\to 0^{+}$, the exponent $1/\\alpha-1$ is negative, so $\\phi'(y) \\to \\infty$. A function with an unbounded derivative on an interval cannot be Lipschitz on that interval.\nThe definition of a Lipschitz domain requires that the boundary can be locally represented as the graph of a Lipschitz function. At the origin, the boundary of $\\Omega_{\\alpha}$ has a cusp, and any local functional representation of its shape, such as $\\phi(y)=y^{1/\\alpha}$, is not Lipschitz continuous. Therefore, $\\Omega_{\\alpha}$ is not a Lipschitz domain.\n\n**Part 3: Implications for Sobolev Trace and Extension Theorems**\n\nThe classical Sobolev trace and extension theorems are cornerstones of the analysis of partial differential equations.\n-   The **Sobolev Trace Theorem** states that for a bounded Lipschitz domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a continuous linear operator $T: W^{1,p}(\\Omega) \\to L^p(\\partial \\Omega)$ that maps a Sobolev function to its boundary values.\n-   The **Sobolev Extension Theorem** states that for a bounded Lipschitz domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, there exists a continuous linear operator $E: W^{1,p}(\\Omega) \\to W^{1,p}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ that extends a function from $\\Omega$ to the entire space while preserving its Sobolev regularity, i.e., $E(u)|_{\\Omega} = u$.\n\nThe hypothesis that $\\Omega$ is a Lipschitz domain is critical for the standard proofs of these theorems, which typically rely on flattening the boundary via local charts and using reflection techniques.\nAs established in Part 2, the domain $\\Omega_{\\alpha}$ for $\\alpha1$ is not a Lipschitz domain due to the presence of the inward-pointing cusp at the origin. Consequently, the classical Sobolev trace and extension theorems are not directly applicable to $\\Omega_{\\alpha}$.\n\nThe failure of the Lipschitz property has significant implications:\n1.  There is no guarantee that an arbitrary function $u \\in W^{1,p}(\\Omega_{\\alpha})$ has a well-defined trace on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega_{\\alpha}$ that belongs to the standard space $L^p(\\partial\\Omega_{\\alpha})$. The trace operator may be unbounded or may map to a different, more complex function space.\n2.  There is no guarantee that an arbitrary function $u \\in W^{1,p}(\\Omega_{\\alpha})$ can be extended to a function in $W^{1,p}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$.\n\nThe study of Sobolev spaces on non-Lipschitz domains, such as those with cusps, is an active area of research. While the classical theorems fail, modified versions may hold, often involving weighted Sobolev spaces or imposing additional conditions on the functions near the singular points of the boundary. The failure of these fundamental theorems complicates the analysis of boundary value problems for PDEs on such domains.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}}$$", "id": "3036891"}, {"introduction": "Trace and extension theorems are not just theoretical constructs; they are fundamental tools for solving partial differential equations.
