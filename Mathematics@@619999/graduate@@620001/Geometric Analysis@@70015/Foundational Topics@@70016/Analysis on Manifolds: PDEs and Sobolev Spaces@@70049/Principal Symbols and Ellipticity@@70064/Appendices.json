It is a standard problem in the theory of second-order elliptic partial differential equations. All provided definitions, constants, and conditions are scientifically sound and a unique, meaningful solution can be derived. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem asks for two tasks. First, to derive the principal symbol of the operator $L_{\\lambda}$ and determine its ellipticity. Second, to find the largest real number $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ for which the associated bilinear form $A_{\\lambda}$ is coercive.\n\nPart 1: Principal Symbol and Ellipticity\n\nThe given partial differential operator is\n$$\nL_{\\lambda} u = -\\partial_{x}\\!\\left(a\\,\\partial_{x} u\\right) - \\partial_{y}\\!\\left(b\\,\\partial_{y} u\\right) - \\lambda\\,u.\n$$\nSince the coefficients $a = \\frac{7}{5}$ and $b = 3$ are constants, the operator can be expanded as\n$$\nL_{\\lambda} u = -a\\,\\partial_{xx} u - b\\,\\partial_{yy} u - \\lambda\\,u.\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear partial differential operator. The principal part of the operator is composed of the highest-order derivative terms. In this case, these are the second-order terms $-a\\,\\partial_{xx} u$ and $-b\\,\\partial_{yy} u$. The term $-\\lambda u$ is a zeroth-order term and thus does not contribute to the principal symbol.\n\nThe principal symbol, denoted $p(x, \\xi)$, of a second-order operator $L u = \\sum_{j,k=1}^n A_{jk}(x)\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_k} + \\dots$ is given by the quadratic form $p(x, \\xi) = \\sum_{j,k=1}^n A_{jk}(x)\\xi_j \\xi_k$. For our operator $L_\\lambda$, the spatial variables are $(x_1, x_2) = (x, y)$ and the cotangent vector is $\\xi = (\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$. The coefficients of the principal part are $A_{11} = -a$, $A_{22} = -b$, and $A_{12}=A_{21}=0$. However, another common convention for the symbol of an operator written as $L_0 = -\\sum \\partial_i(c_{ij}\\partial_j)$ is $\\sigma_{L_0}(x,\\xi) = \\sum c_{ij}(x)\\xi_i\\xi_j$. Following this convention, the principal symbol of $L_{\\lambda}$ is:\n$$\np(x, \\xi) = a\\xi_1^2 + b\\xi_2^2.\n$$\nThe symbol does not depend on the spatial variable $x$ (here, $(x,y)$) because the coefficients $a$ and $b$ are constant. It is also independent of the parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nAn operator is defined to be elliptic if its principal symbol $p(x, \\xi)$ is non-zero for all $x$ in the domain and for all non-zero cotangent vectors $\\xi \\neq 0$.\nWe are given $a = \\frac{7}{5} > 0$ and $b = 3 > 0$. Let $\\xi = (\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$ be any non-zero vector in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This implies that at least one of $\\xi_1$ or $\\xi_2$ is non-zero.\nSince $\\xi_1^2 \\ge 0$ and $\\xi_2^2 \\ge 0$, and $a,b > 0$, the terms $a\\xi_1^2$ and $b\\xi_2^2$ are non-negative. If $\\xi \\neq 0$, then at least one of these terms must be strictly positive. Consequently, their sum $p(x, \\xi) = a\\xi_1^2 + b\\xi_2^2$ is strictly positive for any $\\xi \\neq 0$.\nTherefore, $p(x, \\xi) \\neq 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This condition for ellipticity is satisfied for all $\\lambda \\ge 0$, because the principal symbol is independent of $\\lambda$. Thus, the operator $L_{\\lambda}$ is elliptic for all $\\lambda \\ge 0$.\n\nPart 2: Coercivity of the Bilinear Form $A_{\\lambda}$\n\nThe bilinear form $A_{\\lambda}$ is coercive on the Sobolev space $H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$ with respect to the energy seminorm $E(\\cdot)$ if there exists a constant $c>0$ such that for every function $u \\in H_{0}^{1}(\\Omega)$, the following inequality holds:\n$$\nA_{\\lambda}(u,u) \\geq c\\,E(u)^{2}.\n$$\nLet's substitute the definitions of $A_{\\lambda}(u,u)$ and $E(u)^2$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(a\\,(\\partial_{x}u)^2 + b\\,(\\partial_{y}u)^2 - \\lambda\\,u^2\\right)\\,dx\\,dy \\geq c \\int_{\\Omega}\\left(a\\,(\\partial_{x}u)^2 + b\\,(\\partial_{y}u)^2\\right)\\,dx\\,dy.\n$$\nUsing the definitions of $E(u)^2$ and the $L^2$-norm $\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 = \\int_\\Omega u^2 dx dy$, the inequality can be written as:\n$$\nE(u)^2 - \\lambda \\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2 \\ge c E(u)^2.\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to $(1-c)E(u)^2 \\ge \\lambda \\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2$. For any non-zero $u\\in H_0^1(\\Omega)$, $E(u)>0$. We can divide by $E(u)^2$ to obtain:\n$$\n1-c \\ge \\lambda \\frac{\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2}{E(u)^2}.\n$$\nFor this inequality to hold for some $c>0$ for all $u \\in H_0^1(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}$, we must have\n$$\n1 - \\lambda \\sup_{u \\in H_0^1(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\left(\\frac{\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2}{E(u)^2}\\right) \\ge c > 0.\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the condition\n$$\n1 - \\lambda \\sup_{u \\in H_0^1(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\left(\\frac{\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2}{E(u)^2}\\right) > 0.\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of the spectral characterization of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue. The first eigenvalue $\\mu_1$ of the operator $-\\partial_x(a\\partial_x) - \\partial_y(b\\partial_y)$ on $\\Omega$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is given by the variational principle (Rayleigh-Ritz):\n$$\n\\mu_1 = \\inf_{u \\in H_0^1(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\frac{E(u)^2}{\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2}.\n$$\nFrom this definition, it follows that\n$$\n\\sup_{u \\in H_0^1(\\Omega)\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\left(\\frac{\\|u\\|_{L^2(\\Omega)}^2}{E(u)^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_1}.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the coercivity condition, we get:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu_1} > 0 \\implies \\mu_1 > \\lambda.\n$$\nThe bilinear form $A_\\lambda$ is coercive if and only if $\\lambda < \\mu_1$. If this condition holds, we can choose $c=1-\\lambda/\\mu_1 > 0$, and the coercivity inequality is satisfied. If $\\lambda \\ge \\mu_1$, the inequality cannot hold for any $c>0$ for all $u$, as demonstrated by testing with the first eigenfunction $u_1$, for which $E(u_1)^2/\\|u_1\\|_{L^2}^2 = \\mu_1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest real number $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ such that $A_{\\lambda}$ is coercive. This number is the supremum of the set of all $\\lambda$ for which coercivity holds, which is the interval $(-\\infty, \\mu_1)$. Therefore, $\\lambda^{\\ast} = \\mu_1$.\n\nTo find $\\mu_1$, we solve the eigenvalue problem $-a u_{xx} - b u_{yy} = \\mu u$ on the domain $\\Omega=(0,\\pi)\\times(0,\\pi)$ with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. The eigenfunctions are known to be of the form $u_{m,n}(x,y) = \\sin(mx)\\sin(ny)$ for integers $m,n \\ge 1$. Substituting this into the PDE yields the eigenvalues:\n$$\n-a(-m^2 u_{m,n}) -b(-n^2 u_{m,n}) = \\mu_{m,n} u_{m,n} \\implies \\mu_{m,n} = am^2 + bn^2.\n$$\nThe first (smallest) eigenvalue $\\mu_1$ corresponds to the minimum value of $\\mu_{m,n}$ over $m,n \\in \\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}$. Since $a=\\frac{7}{5}>0$ and $b=3>0$, the minimum is achieved at $m=1$ and $n=1$:\n$$\n\\mu_1 = \\mu_{1,1} = a(1)^2 + b(1)^2 = a+b.\n$$\nUsing the specified values for $a$ and $b$:\n$$\n\\mu_1 = \\frac{7}{5} + 3 = \\frac{7}{5} + \\frac{15}{5} = \\frac{22}{5}.\n$$\nTherefore, the largest real number $\\lambda^{\\ast}$ for which the bilinear form is coercive is $\\frac{22}{5}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{22}{5}}$$", "id": "3032891"}, {"introduction": "When we move from scalar PDEs to systems, the definition of ellipticity naturally generalizes: the principal symbol becomes a matrix that must be invertible for all non-zero covectors $\\xi$.

The space $E_{+}(\\xi')$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}$ via the evaluation map at the boundary $t=0$, i.e., $v \\mapsto v(0)$. For $v(t) = c \\exp(-|\\xi'| t)$, we have $v(0) = c$. The symbol is then identified with the scalar (or matrix) that maps $v(0)$ to the value of the boundary operator acting on $v(t)$.\n\nLet us now compute the symbols for the given boundary operators.\n\n1.  **Dirichlet Boundary Condition**:\n    The Dirichlet boundary operator is $\\gamma_{0}u := u|_{t=0}$. We apply this to a generic decaying solution $v(t) = c \\exp(-|\\xi'| t)$.\n    $$\n    \\gamma_{0}v = v(0) = c \\exp(-|\\xi'| \\cdot 0) = c\n    $$\n    The principal boundary symbol for the Dirichlet condition, $\\sigma_{D}(\\xi')$, is the map that takes $v(0)=c$ to $\\gamma_{0}v=c$. This is the identity map $c \\mapsto c$, which corresponds to multiplication by $1$.\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{D}(\\xi') = 1\n    $$\n\n2.  **Neumann Boundary Condition**:\n    The Neumann boundary operator is $\\gamma_{1}u := \\partial_{t}u|_{t=0}$. We apply this to the same decaying solution $v(t) = c \\exp(-|\\xi'| t)$. First, we compute the derivative with respect to $t$:\n    $$\n    \\partial_{t}v(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( c \\exp(-|\\xi'| t) \\right) = -c|\\xi'|\\exp(-|\\xi'| t)\n    $$\n    Now, we evaluate at the boundary $t=0$:\n    $$\n    \\gamma_{1}v = (\\partial_{t}v)|_{t=0} = -c|\\xi'|\\exp(-|\\xi'| \\cdot 0) = -c|\\xi'|\n    $$\n    The principal boundary symbol for the Neumann condition, $\\sigma_{N}(\\xi')$, is the map that takes $v(0)=c$ to $\\gamma_{1}v = -c|\\xi'|$. This corresponds to multiplication by $-|\\xi'|$.\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{N}(\\xi') = -|\\xi'|\n    $$\n\n**Commentary on the Lopatinskii–Shapiro Condition**:\n\nThe Lopatinskii–Shapiro (or complementing) condition is a crucial criterion for the ellipticity of a boundary value problem. For an elliptic operator $P$ and a boundary operator $B$, the condition requires that for every non-zero tangential covector $\\xi'$, the map\n$$\nv \\in E_{+}(\\xi') \\mapsto (Bv)|_{t=0} \\in \\mathbb{C}^k\n$$\n(where $k$ is the number of boundary conditions) is an isomorphism. In our case, $k=1$, and the space of decaying solutions $E_{+}(\\xi')$ is one-dimensional for $\\xi' \\neq 0$. The map is an isomorphism if and only if it is not the zero map. Using the identification of $E_{+}(\\xi')$ with $\\mathbb{C}$ via evaluation at $t=0$, this condition is equivalent to requiring that the principal boundary symbol, as a linear map from $\\mathbb{C}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$, is invertible. This means the scalar value of the symbol must be non-zero.\n\n-   For the Dirichlet condition, the symbol is $\\sigma_{D}(\\xi')=1$. Since $1 \\neq 0$, the map is always an isomorphism. The Lopatinskii–Shapiro condition is satisfied for all $\\xi' \\neq 0$. Thus, the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian is an elliptic boundary value problem.\n\n-   For the Neumann condition, the symbol is $\\sigma_{N}(\\xi')=-|\\xi'|$. For any non-zero tangential covector $\\xi' \\neq 0$, we have $|\\xi'| > 0$, and therefore $\\sigma_{N}(\\xi') \\neq 0$. The map is an isomorphism for all $\\xi' \\neq 0$. The Lopatinskii–Shapiro condition is satisfied. Thus, the Neumann problem for the Laplacian is also an elliptic boundary value problem.\n\nThis analysis confirms the well-posedness of these classical boundary value problems from the perspective of modern elliptic theory.\n\nThe final answer, as a two-entry row matrix, combines our results for the Dirichlet and Neumann symbols.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -|\\xi'|\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3032887"}]}
