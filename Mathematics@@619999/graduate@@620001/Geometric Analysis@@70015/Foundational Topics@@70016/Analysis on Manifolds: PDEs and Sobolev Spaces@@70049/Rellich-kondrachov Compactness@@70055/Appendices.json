Thus, no subsequence converges, demonstrating the lack of compactness. **This statement is correct.**\n\n- **E:** This statement claims that for $\\alpha > 1 - n/p$, the embedding is continuous but not compact.

By Morrey's inequality, $u_i$ is Hölder continuous with exponent $\\alpha = 1 - n/p$ on this local chart. Since the manifold $M$ is compact, it can be covered by a finite number of such charts. A function that is locally Hölder continuous with a uniform exponent on a compact space is globally Hölder continuous with the same exponent.

For any exponent $\\beta$ strictly less than $\\alpha$ (i.e., $\\beta < 1 - n/p$), the uniform convergence in $C^0$ and the uniform bound in $C^{0,\\alpha}$ together imply convergence in the stronger $C^{0,\\beta}$ norm.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The embedding $W^{1,p}(M) \\hookrightarrow C^{0,\\beta}(M)$ is compact for any $\\beta < 1 - n/p$.
