The validation process confirms that the problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe principal symbol of a $k$-th order linear differential operator is a function on the cotangent bundle $T^*M$ that captures the highest-order behavior of the operator. It can be computed in local coordinates by expressing the operator in terms of partial derivatives $\\partial_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}$ and then replacing each $\\partial_i$ with $i\\xi_i$, where $\\xi = \\xi_i dx^i$ is a cotangent vector. We only consider the terms of the highest order, which in this case is $k=2$.\n\nFirst, we must find the principal part of $L$, denoted $P_2(L)$, which consists of all second-order derivative terms. The operator is given in divergence form:\n$$\nL u = -\\nabla_{i}\\!\\left(a^{ij}(x)\\,\\nabla_{j} u\\right) + b^{i}(x)\\,\\nabla_{i} u + c(x)\\,u\n$$\nThe terms $b^{i}(x)\\,\\nabla_{i} u$ and $c(x)\\,u$ are of first and zeroth order, respectively, so they do not contribute to the principal symbol. We focus on the term $-\\nabla_{i}\\!\\left(a^{ij}(x)\\,\\nabla_{j} u\\right)$.\n\nLet us work in a local coordinate chart $(U, \\{x^i\\})$. On a scalar function $u \\in C^{\\infty}(M)$, the covariant derivative $\\nabla_j u$ is the same as the partial derivative $\\partial_j u$. So, we have $\\nabla_j u = \\partial_j u$. The term $a^{ij}(x)\\,\\partial_j u$ forms the components of a vector field, let's call it $V^i = a^{ij}(x)\\,\\partial_j u$. The operator term is then $-\\nabla_i V^i$, which is the negative of the divergence of $V$. The formula for the divergence of a vector field $V$ in local coordinates is:\n$$\n\\nabla_i V^i = \\partial_i V^i + \\Gamma^i_{ik} V^k\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma^i_{ik}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection $\\nabla$. Substituting $V^i = a^{ij}\\partial_j u$:\n$$\n\\nabla_i (a^{ij}\\partial_j u) = \\partial_i(a^{ij}\\partial_j u) + \\Gamma^i_{ik} (a^{kj}\\partial_j u)\n$$\nWe apply the product rule to the first term:\n$$\n\\partial_i(a^{ij}\\partial_j u) = a^{ij} \\partial_i \\partial_j u + (\\partial_i a^{ij}) \\partial_j u\n$$\nCombining these, the full expression for the highest-order part of $L$ is:\n$$\n-\\nabla_i(a^{ij}\\nabla_j u) = -a^{ij} \\partial_i \\partial_j u - (\\partial_i a^{ij}) \\partial_j u - \\Gamma^i_{ik} a^{kj} \\partial_j u\n$$\nThe only term containing second-order derivatives is $-a^{ij}(x)\\,\\partial_i\\partial_j u$. Therefore, the principal part of the operator $L$ is:\n$$\nP_2(L)u = -a^{ij}(x)\\,\\partial_i\\partial_j u\n$$\nTo compute the principal symbol $\\sigma_L(x, \\xi)$, we apply the formal substitution rule $\\partial_k \\mapsto i\\xi_k$ to the principal part $P_2(L)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_L(x, \\xi) = -a^{ij}(x)\\,(i\\xi_i)(i\\xi_j) = -a^{ij}(x)\\,i^2\\,\\xi_i\\xi_j = a^{ij}(x)\\,\\xi_i\\xi_j\n$$\nThis expression is the principal symbol of the operator $L$.\n\nNext, we derive the ellipticity condition. An operator is defined as elliptic at a point $x \\in M$ if its principal symbol $\\sigma_L(x, \\xi)$ is non-zero for all non-zero cotangent vectors $\\xi \\in T_x^*M$. Thus, the condition is:\n$$\n\\sigma_L(x, \\xi) = a^{ij}(x)\\,\\xi_i\\xi_j \\neq 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\neq 0\n$$\nThe coefficient tensor $a^{ij}(x)$ is not assumed to be symmetric. We can decompose it into its symmetric part $s^{ij}(x)$ and its skew-symmetric part $k^{ij}(x)$:\n$$\na^{ij} = s^{ij} + k^{ij}\n$$\nwhere $s^{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(a^{ij} + a^{ji})$ and $k^{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}(a^{ij} - a^{ji})$. Substituting this into the symbol expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_L(x, \\xi) = (s^{ij} + k^{ij})\\,\\xi_i\\xi_j = s^{ij}\\xi_i\\xi_j + k^{ij}\\xi_i\\xi_j\n$$\nLet us analyze the term involving the skew-symmetric part, $k^{ij}\\xi_i\\xi_j$. Since $k^{ij}=-k^{ji}$ and the indices $i$ and $j$ are dummy indices being summed over, we can relabel them:\n$$\nk^{ij}\\xi_i\\xi_j = k^{ji}\\xi_j\\xi_i = (-k^{ij})\\xi_i\\xi_j = -k^{ij}\\xi_i\\xi_j\n$$\nThis implies that $2\\,k^{ij}\\xi_i\\xi_j = 0$, so $k^{ij}\\xi_i\\xi_j = 0$. The skew-symmetric part of $a^{ij}$ does not contribute to the principal symbol. The symbol is therefore determined solely by the symmetric part of $a^{ij}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_L(x, \\xi) = s^{ij}(x)\\,\\xi_i\\xi_j\n$$\nThe ellipticity condition $\\sigma_L(x, \\xi) \\neq 0$ for all $\\xi \\neq 0$ now becomes $s^{ij}(x)\\,\\xi_i\\xi_j \\neq 0$ for all $\\xi \\neq 0$.\nThe expression $S(\\xi) = s^{ij}(x)\\,\\xi_i\\xi_j$ is a real-valued quadratic form on the cotangent space $T_x^*M$. For this continuous function to be non-zero for all non-zero $\\xi$, it must be sign-definite, i.e., either strictly positive or strictly negative. By convention, ellipticity (or positive ellipticity) requires the symbol to be positive. So, the condition is that the symmetric tensor $s^{ij}(x)$ is positive definite:\n$$\ns^{ij}(x)\\,\\xi_i\\xi_j > 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\in T_x^*M, \\xi \\neq 0.\n$$\nThis must be related to the Riemannian metric $g$. The positive definiteness of $s^{ij}$ can be expressed as a uniform bound. On the compact set of unit covectors $\\{\\xi \\in T_x^*M \\mid |\\xi|_g^2 = g^{ij}(x)\\xi_i\\xi_j = 1\\}$, the continuous function $S(\\xi) = s^{ij}\\xi_i\\xi_j$ attains a minimum value, which we denote $\\alpha(x)$. The condition of positive definiteness implies that this minimum must be strictly positive, i.e., $\\alpha(x) > 0$.\n\nFor any non-zero $\\xi \\in T_x^*M$, we can define the unit covector $\\hat{\\xi} = \\xi / |\\xi|_g$. We have $s^{ij}\\hat{\\xi}_i\\hat{\\xi}_j \\ge \\alpha(x)$.

The analysis is performed within the framework of pseudodifferential operator (PDO) calculus.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary concepts from the theory of pseudodifferential operators. Let $U$ be an open set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The class of symbols of order $m \\in \\mathbb{R}$, denoted $S^m(U \\times \\mathbb{R}^n)$, consists of smooth functions $a(x, \\xi)$ on $U \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$ such that for any compact subset $K \\subset U$ and any multi-indices $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{N}_0^n$, there exists a constant $C_{K, \\alpha, \\beta}$ for which\n$$\n|\\partial_x^\\alpha \\partial_\\xi^\\beta a(x, \\xi)| \\leq C_{K, \\alpha, \\beta} (1 + |\\xi|)^{m - |\\beta|}\n$$\nfor all $(x, \\xi) \\in K \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nA classical symbol $a(x, \\xi)$ of order $m$ is a symbol in $S^m$ that admits an asymptotic expansion $a \\sim \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} a_{m-j}$, where each $a_{m-j}(x, \\xi)$ is a smooth function on $U \\times (\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\{0\\})$, homogeneous of degree $m-j$ in $\\xi$, i.e., $a_{m-j}(x, t\\xi) = t^{m-j} a_{m-j}(x, \\xi)$ for $t > 0$. The leading term $a_m(x, \\xi)$ is called the principal symbol of the operator. A differential operator $P = \\sum_{|\\alpha| \\leq m} a_\\alpha(x) D^\\alpha$, where $D = -i\\partial_x$, has the full symbol $p(x, \\xi) = \\sum_{|\\alpha| \\leq m} a_\\alpha(x) \\xi^\\alpha$, which is a polynomial in $\\xi$. This is a classical symbol with principal symbol $p_m(x, \\xi) = \\sum_{|\\alpha|=m} a_\\alpha(x) \\xi^\\alpha$.\n\nThe composition of two PDOs, $P = \\text{Op}(p)$ and $Q = \\text{Op}(q)$ with $p \\in S^{m_1}$ and $q \\in S^{m_2}$, is another PDO, $PQ = \\text{Op}(r)$, whose symbol $r$ has the asymptotic expansion\n$$\nr(x, \\xi) \\sim \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}_0^n} \\frac{1}{\\alpha!} (\\partial_\\xi^\\alpha p(x, \\xi))(D_x^\\alpha q(x, \\xi)), \\quad D_x = -i\\partial_x.\n$$\nIf $p$ and $q$ are classical symbols, so is $r$. The principal symbol of the composition is the product of the principal symbols: $\\sigma_{m_1+m_2}(PQ) = p_{m_1} q_{m_2}$.\n\nWe are tasked with constructing a parametrix $Q$ for an elliptic operator $P$ of order $m \\geq 1$. A parametrix is an operator $Q$ such that $PQ = I - R_1$ and $QP = I - R_2$, where $I$ is the identity operator and $R_1, R_2$ are smoothing operators.

We set this equal to $1$:\n$$\np_m(x, \\xi) q_{-m}(x, \\xi) = 1.\n$$\nThe operator $P$ is elliptic, which means its principal symbol $p_m(x, \\xi)$ is non-zero for $\\xi \\neq 0$ (or at least for $|\\xi| \\geq R > 0$). This is the crucial property that allows us to define\n$$\nq_{-m}(x, \\xi) = \\frac{1}{p_m(x, \\xi)}\n$$\nfor large $|\\xi|$. We can extend this to a symbol in $S^{-m}$ by multiplying with a cutoff function near $\\xi=0$. The function $q_{-m}(x, \\xi)$ is the principal symbol of the parametrix $Q$.\n\nNext order term (order $-1$):\nThe term of order $-1$ in the expansion for $r(x,\\xi)$ is\n$$\nr_{-1} = p_m q_{-m-1} + p_{m-1} q_{-m} + \\frac{1}{i}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial p_m}{\\partial \\xi_k} \\frac{\\partial q_{-m}}{\\partial x^k}.\n$$\nWe set this to $0$ and solve for $q_{-m-1}$:\n$$\nq_{-m-1} = -\\frac{1}{p_m} \\left( p_{m-1} q_{-m} + \\frac{1}{i}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\partial p_m}{\\partial \\xi_k} \\frac{\\partial q_{-m}}{\\partial x^k} \\right).\n$$\nThis is well-defined because of ellipticity. The right-hand side is homogeneous of degree $-m-1$, and this process can be continued indefinitely to find all $q_{-m-j}$.\n\nUsing Borel's theorem, we can construct a symbol $q \\in S^{-m}$ such that $q \\sim \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} q_{-m-j}$. Let $Q = \\text{Op}(q)$. By construction, the symbol of $PQ$ has an asymptotic expansion that starts with $1$ and has all lower order terms equal to $0$. This means $\\sigma(PQ) - 1 \\in S^{-\\infty}$. Thus, $PQ - I$ is a smoothing operator. A similar argument holds for $QP-I$. This completes the general construction of the parametrix.\n\nNow, we specialize to the given case. The operator has order $m=2$. Its principal symbol at the point $x_0$ is given by\n$$\np_2(x_0, \\xi) = g^{ij}(x_0) \\xi_i \\xi_j,\n$$\nwhere summation over repeated indices $i, j$ from $1$ to $n$ is implied. This is a quadratic form in $\\xi$. Since $g$ is a Riemannian metric, the matrix $(g^{ij})$ is symmetric and positive definite. Thus, for any non-zero covector $\\xi = (\\xi_1, \\dots, \\xi_n)$, the value $p_2(x_0, \\xi)$ is strictly positive, which confirms the operator is elliptic at $x_0$.\n\nThe principal symbol of the parametrix $Q$ at $x_0$, denoted $\\sigma_Q(x_0, \\xi)$, is the term $q_{-m}(x_0, \\xi) = q_{-2}(x_0, \\xi)$ from our construction.

The forcing term $f$ is given to be smooth, $f \\in C^{\\infty}(S^n)$. This implies that $f$ belongs to every Sobolev space $H^{k}(S^n)$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\nAssuming a distributional solution $u \\in \\mathcal{D}'(S^n)$ exists, we can start a bootstrap argument. Since $f \\in L^2(S^n) = H^0(S^n)$, the elliptic regularity theorem implies that $u \\in H^{0+2}(S^n) = H^2(S^n)$.\nNow we know $u \\in H^2(S^n)$. However, $f$ is not just in $H^0$, it is in $H^k$ for all $k$. Let's take $f \\in H^2(S^n)$. Applying the theorem again, we find that $u$ must belong to $H^{2+2}(S^n) = H^4(S^n)$.\nWe can continue this process indefinitely. If we have shown $u \\in H^{k}(S^n)$ for some $k$, since $f \\in C^{\\infty}(S^n)$ implies $f \\in H^{k}(S^n)$, the theorem guarantees that $u \\in H^{k+2}(S^n)$. By induction, $u$ belongs to $H^{2j}(S^n)$ for all integers $j \\ge 1$.\nThe intersection of all Sobolev spaces on a smooth compact manifold is precisely the space of smooth functions: $\\bigcap_{k \\ge 0} H^{k}(S^n) = C^{\\infty}(S^n)$. Therefore, the solution $u$ must be smooth, i.e., $u \\in C^{\\infty}(S^n)$.\n\nFinally, we identify the compatibility condition for the existence of a solution. On a compact manifold $M$ without boundary like $S^n$, the Laplace–Beltrami operator is self-adjoint with respect to the $L^2$ inner product: $\\langle \\phi, \\psi \\rangle = \\int_M \\phi \\psi \\, d\\text{vol}_g$. That is, $\\langle \\Delta_g \\phi, \\psi \\rangle = \\langle \\phi, \\Delta_g \\psi \\rangle$.\nThe kernel of the Laplacian on a compact connected manifold consists of the constant functions. So, $\\ker(\\Delta_g) = \\{c \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.\nIf a solution $u$ to $\\Delta_g u = f$ exists, we must have $\\langle \\Delta_g u, h \\rangle = \\langle f, h \\rangle$ for any function $h$. Let us choose $h \\in \\ker(\\Delta_g)$. Using the self-adjointness property:\n$$\n\\langle u, \\Delta_g h \\rangle = \\langle f, h \\rangle\n$$\nSince $h$ is in the kernel, $\\Delta_g h = 0$. The equation becomes $\\langle u, 0 \\rangle = \\langle f, h \\rangle$, which implies $\\langle f, h \\rangle = 0$. This means $f$ must be orthogonal to every function in the kernel of $\\Delta_g$. As the kernel is spanned by the constant function $h=1$, this gives the necessary condition:\n$$\n\\langle f, 1 \\rangle = \\int_{S^n} f \\cdot 1 \\, d\\text{vol}_g = 0\n$$\nThis compatibility condition, which ensures that the right-hand side is orthogonal to the kernel of the operator, is provided in the problem statement. By the Fredholm alternative for elliptic operators, this condition is also sufficient for the existence of a weak solution, which is then shown to be smooth by the regularity argument above. The solution is unique up to an additive constant, an element from the kernel of $\\Delta_g$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{1+r^{2}}{2}\\right)^{2} \\left[ v''(r) + \\frac{n-1 - (n-3)r^{2}}{r(1+r^{2})} v'(r) \\right]}\n$$", "id": "3027953"}]}
