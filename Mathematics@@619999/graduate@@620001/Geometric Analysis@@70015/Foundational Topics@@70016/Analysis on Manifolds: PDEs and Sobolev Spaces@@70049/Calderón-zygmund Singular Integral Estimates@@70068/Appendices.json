Meyer, using probabilistic methods, establishes that for any complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, the Riesz transform $R$ is always bounded on $L^{p}(M)$ for the range $1  p \\leq 2$. Therefore, any failure of boundedness must occur for $p  2$.\n\nThe failure of $L^p$ boundedness for $p2$ is a deep phenomenon linked to the large-scale geometry of the manifold. A key theorem, developed by Thierry Coulhon and Xuan Thinh Duong, provides a precise criterion for this failure. It states that if a complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ has at least two ends and a positive spectral gap (i.e., $\\lambda_0(M)  0$), then the Riesz transform $R$ is bounded on $L^p(M)$ for $1  p \\leq 2$ but is **unbounded** for all $p  2$.\n\nThe mechanism behind this failure is the existence of non-constant bounded harmonic functions with finite Dirichlet energy. On a manifold with multiple ends and a spectral gap, one can construct non-constant harmonic functions ($\\Delta u = 0$) that are bounded, have finite Dirichlet energy ($\\int_M |\\nabla u|^2 d\\mu  \\infty$), but are not in $L^2(M)$.
