Derivation of the Integration by Parts Formula**\nWe begin with the integral in question. Let the vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ be defined as $\\mathbf{F} = A\\nabla u$. The integrand involves the term $(\\operatorname{div} \\mathbf{F})v$. We use the product rule for the divergence of a scalar field $v$ times a vector field $\\mathbf{F}$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{div}(v\\mathbf{F}) = \\nabla v \\cdot \\mathbf{F} + v \\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{F})\n$$\nRearranging this identity to isolate the term present in our integral gives:\n$$\nv \\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{F}) = \\operatorname{div}(v\\mathbf{F}) - \\nabla v \\cdot \\mathbf{F}\n$$\nNow, we integrate this expression over the domain $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v \\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{F}) \\, dx = \\int_{\\Omega} \\operatorname{div}(v\\mathbf{F}) \\, dx - \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla v \\cdot \\mathbf{F} \\, dx\n$$\nThe first term on the right-hand side can be transformed into a boundary integral using the divergence theorem, which states $\\int_{\\Omega} \\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{G}) \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{G} \\cdot \\nu \\, dS$ for a vector field $\\mathbf{G}$. Applying this with $\\mathbf{G} = v\\mathbf{F}$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\operatorname{div}(v\\mathbf{F}) \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} (v\\mathbf{F}) \\cdot \\nu \\, dS\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we obtain:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} v \\operatorname{div}(\\mathbf{F}) \\, dx = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} v (\\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\nu) \\, dS - \\int_{\\Omega} \\nabla v \\cdot \\mathbf{F} \\, dx\n$$\nThe original integral included a negative sign. Multiplying by $-1$ and substituting back $\\mathbf{F} = A\\nabla u$, we arrive at the desired identity, often known as Green's first identity for the operator $L(u) = -\\operatorname{div}(A\\nabla u)$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\big(-\\operatorname{div}(A\\nabla u)\\big) v \\, dx = \\int_{\\Omega} (A\\nabla u) \\cdot \\nabla v \\, dx - \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} v (A\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu) \\, dS\n$$\nThis equation rewrites the original integral as the sum of a new bulk (or volume) term, $\\int_{\\Omega} (A\\nabla u) \\cdot \\nabla v \\, dx$, and a boundary term, which is identified as:\n$$\n\\text{Boundary Term} = - \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} v (A\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu) \\, dS\n$$\nThe expression $A\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu$ is the conormal derivative of $u$ with respect to the operator $L$.\n\n**2.2. Expression in Geometric Coordinates**\nThe next step is to express the conormal derivative $A\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu$ in the local orthonormal frame $\\{e_{1},\\dots,e_{n}\\}$ defined at an arbitrary point $p \\in \\partial \\Omega$, where $e_{n} = \\nu$. For clarity, we will omit the explicit dependence on $p$ in the notation.\n\nThe gradient vector $\\nabla u$ can be expressed in this basis as:\n$$\n\\nabla u = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\nabla u \\cdot e_j) e_j\n$$\nHere, the coefficients $(\\nabla u \\cdot e_j)$ are the components of the gradient vector in this basis. The term $\\nabla u \\cdot e_n$ is the normal derivative, often denoted $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\nu}$, while the terms $\\nabla u \\cdot e_j$ for $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ are tangential derivatives.\n\nThe tensor field $A$ acts as a linear transformation on vectors. We compute the vector $A\\nabla u$:\n$$\nA\\nabla u = A\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\nabla u \\cdot e_j) e_j\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\nabla u \\cdot e_j) (A e_j)\n$$\nNow, we compute the dot product of this vector with the normal vector $\\nu = e_n$:\n$$\nA\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu = (A\\nabla u) \\cdot e_n = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\nabla u \\cdot e_j) (A e_j)\\right) \\cdot e_n = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\nabla u \\cdot e_j) (A e_j \\cdot e_n)\n$$\nThe components of the tensor $A$ in the basis $\\{e_i\\}$ are given by the matrix $A_{ij} = e_i \\cdot (A e_j)$. Therefore, the term $A e_j \\cdot e_n$ is precisely the component $A_{nj}$. Substituting this into the expression for the conormal derivative, we get:\n$$\nA\\nabla u \\cdot \\nu = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{nj} (\\nabla u \\cdot e_j)\n$$\nSince the tensor $A$ is symmetric, we also have $A_{nj} = A_{jn}$.\n\n**2.3. Final Expression for the Boundary Term**\nWe now substitute this local coordinate representation of the conormal derivative back into the expression for the boundary term. At each point $x \\in \\partial \\Omega$, we utilize the local frame $\\{e_j(x)\\}$ and the corresponding components $A_{nj}(x)$ of the tensor. The final expression for the boundary term is:\n$$\n- \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} v(x) \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{nj}(x) (\\nabla u(x) \\cdot e_j(x)) \\right) dS(x)\n$$\nThis is the boundary term written as a single integral over $\\partial\\Omega$ in the specified geometric coordinates.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{- \\int_{\\partial \\Omega} v(x) \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{nj}(x) (\\nabla u(x) \\cdot e_j(x)) \\right) dS(x)}\n$$", "id": "3027728"}, {"introduction": "After defining boundary conditions in the abstract, constructing explicit solutions provides invaluable insight.

The method of images proposes a specific form for $H$ to satisfy the boundary conditions.\n\n1) **Dirichlet Boundary Condition**\nThe Dirichlet boundary condition requires $G_D(x,y) = 0$ for $x$ on the boundary, i.e., for $x = (x', 0)$. We propose a solution of the form\n$$G_{D}(x,y) = \\Phi_{n}(x-y) + c_{D}\\,\\Phi_{n}(x-y^{*})$$\nWe enforce the boundary condition at a point $x_b = (x', 0)$ on the boundary plane. At this point, the squared distance to $y = (y', y_n)$ is $|x_b - y|^2 = |(x'-y', -y_n)|^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + y_n^2$. The squared distance to the image point $y^{*} = (y', -y_n)$ is $|x_b - y^{*}|^2 = |(x'-y', y_n)|^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + y_n^2$. Thus, $|x_b - y| = |x_b - y^{*}|$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $G_D$ at the boundary:\n$$G_{D}(x_b, y) = \\Phi_{n}(x_b-y) + c_{D}\\,\\Phi_{n}(x_b-y^{*}) = \\frac{1}{(n-2)\\,\\omega_{n}}\\,|x_b-y|^{2-n} + c_{D}\\,\\frac{1}{(n-2)\\,\\omega_{n}}\\,|x_b-y^{*}|^{2-n}$$\nSince $|x_b-y| = |x_b-y^{*}|$, this simplifies to:\n$$G_{D}(x_b, y) = (1+c_{D})\\,\\Phi_{n}(x_b-y)$$\nThe Dirichlet condition $G_{D}(x_b, y) = 0$ requires $1+c_{D}=0$, which gives $c_{D}=-1$.\nThe Green's function is $G_D(x,y) = \\Phi_n(x-y) - \\Phi_n(x-y^*)$.\nVerification: By construction, this function vanishes for any point $(x',0)$ on the boundary.\n\n2) **Neumann Boundary Condition**\nThe Neumann boundary condition is $\\partial_{\\nu} G_N(x',0;y) = 0$. The outward normal derivative is $\\partial_{\\nu} = -\\partial_{x_{n}}$. We propose the form\n$$G_{N}(x,y) = \\Phi_{n}(x-y) + c_{N}\\,\\Phi_{n}(x-y^{*})$$\nWe need to compute the normal derivative. The derivative of the fundamental solution with respect to $x_n$ is:\n$$\\partial_{x_{n}} \\Phi_{n}(x-z) = \\partial_{x_{n}} \\left( \\frac{1}{(n-2)\\omega_n} |x-z|^{2-n} \\right) = \\frac{1}{(n-2)\\omega_n} (2-n) |x-z|^{1-n} \\frac{\\partial |x-z|}{\\partial x_n}$$\n$$= -\\frac{1}{\\omega_n} |x-z|^{1-n} \\frac{x_n-z_n}{|x-z|} = -\\frac{1}{\\omega_n} |x-z|^{-n}(x_n-z_n)$$\nWe apply this for $z=y=(y',y_n)$ and $z=y^*=(y',-y_n)$, and evaluate at $x_b=(x',0)$.\nFor $z=y$: $\\partial_{x_n}\\Phi_n(x-y)|_{x_n=0} = -\\frac{1}{\\omega_n}|x_b-y|^{-n}(0-y_n) = \\frac{y_n}{\\omega_n}|x_b-y|^{-n}$.\nFor $z=y^*$: $\\partial_{x_n}\\Phi_n(x-y^*)|_{x_n=0} = -\\frac{1}{\\omega_n}|x_b-y^*|^{-n}(0-(-y_n)) = -\\frac{y_n}{\\omega_n}|x_b-y^*|^{-n}$.\nThe normal derivative of $G_N$ at the boundary is:\n$$\\partial_{\\nu} G_N(x_b, y) = -\\partial_{x_n} G_N(x_b, y) = -\\left( \\frac{y_n}{\\omega_n}|x_b-y|^{-n} + c_N \\left(-\\frac{y_n}{\\omega_n}|x_b-y^*|^{-n}\\right) \\right)$$\nUsing $|x_b-y|=|x_b-y^*|$, this becomes:\n$$\\partial_{\\nu} G_N(x_b, y) = -\\frac{y_n}{\\omega_n}|x_b-y|^{-n} (1-c_N)$$\nThe Neumann condition $\\partial_{\\nu} G_N = 0$ implies $1-c_N=0$, so $c_N=1$.\nThe Green's function is $G_N(x,y) = \\Phi_n(x-y) + \\Phi_n(x-y^*)$.\nVerification: By construction, the normal derivative of this function vanishes on the boundary.\n\n3) **Robin Boundary Condition**\nThe Robin condition is $\\partial_{\\nu} G(x',0;y) + \\alpha\\,G(x',0;y) = 0$ for a constant $\\alpha > 0$.\n\nFirst, we show that an ansatz of the form $G_{R}(x,y) = \\Phi_{n}(x-y) + c_{R}\\,\\Phi_{n}(x-y^{*})$ with a constant $c_R$ cannot work. Using our previous calculations at a boundary point $x_b=(x',0)$:\n$$G_R(x_b, y) = (1+c_R)\\Phi_n(x_b-y) = (1+c_R) \\frac{1}{(n-2)\\omega_n} |x_b-y|^{2-n}$$\n$$\\partial_{\\nu} G_R(x_b, y) = -\\frac{y_n}{\\omega_n}|x_b-y|^{-n}(1-c_R) = \\frac{y_n(n-2)}{n-2} \\frac{1-c_R}{\\omega_n} |x_b-y|^{-n}$$\nThe Robin condition becomes:\n$$\\frac{y_n(n-2)(1-c_R)}{(n-2)\\omega_n} |x_b-y|^{-n} + \\alpha (1+c_R) \\frac{1}{(n-2)\\omega_n} |x_b-y|^{2-n} = 0$$\nMultiplying by $(n-2)\\omega_n |x_b-y|^{n}$ (and assuming not everything is zero):\n$$y_n(n-2)(1-c_R) + \\alpha(1+c_R)|x_b-y|^2 = 0$$\nSubstituting $|x_b-y|^2 = |x'-y'|^2 + y_n^2$:\n$$y_n(n-2)(1-c_R) + \\alpha(1+c_R)(|x'-y'|^2 + y_n^2) = 0$$\nThis equation must hold for all $x' \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. The term $|x'-y'|^2$ is not constant. For the equation to hold universally, the coefficient of $|x'-y'|^2$ must be zero. Since $\\alpha > 0$, this requires $1+c_R=0$, so $c_R=-1$. Substituting $c_R=-1$ back into the equation gives $y_n(n-2)(1-(-1)) = 0$, which simplifies to $2y_n(n-2)=0$. This is a contradiction, since $y_n>0$ and $n \\geq 3$. Thus, no constant $c_R$ can satisfy the Robin condition.\n\nNext, we use the Fourier transform in the tangential variables $x'$. The Laplacian operator becomes $\\Delta_x = \\Delta_{x'} + \\partial_{x_n}^2$. Taking the Fourier transform of the governing equation $-\\Delta_x G = \\delta(x-y)$ with respect to $x'$ yields:\n$$-(-\\rho^2 \\widehat{G}(\\xi,x_n;y) + \\partial_{x_n}^2 \\widehat{G}(\\xi,x_n;y)) = \\mathcal{F}_{x'}\\{\\delta(x'-y')\\delta(x_n-y_n)\\}$$\nwhere $\\rho=|\\xi|$. The right side becomes $\\exp(-i\\xi\\cdot y')\\delta(x_n-y_n)$. The equation is:\n$$(\\partial_{x_n}^2 - \\rho^2)\\widehat{G}(\\xi,x_n;y) = -\\exp(-i\\xi\\cdot y')\\delta(x_n-y_n)$$\nThis is a 1D ODE in $x_n$ for $x_n > 0$. For $x_n \\neq y_n$, the general solution is a linear combination of $\\exp(\\rho x_n)$ and $\\exp(-\\rho x_n)$.\nThe decay condition $G(x,y)\\to 0$ as $|x|\\to\\infty$ implies $\\widehat{G}(\\xi,x_n;y)\\to 0$ as $x_n\\to\\infty$. Thus, for $x_n>y_n$, the solution must be of the form:\n$$\\widehat{G}_{>}(\\xi,x_n;y) = C \\exp(-\\rho x_n)$$\nFor $0 < x_n < y_n$, the solution is:\n$$\\widehat{G}_{<}(\\xi,x_n;y) = A \\exp(\\rho x_n) + B \\exp(-\\rho x_n)$$\nThe transformed Robin boundary condition at $x_n=0$ is $-\\partial_{x_n}\\widehat{G}(\\xi,0;y) + \\alpha \\widehat{G}(\\xi,0;y) = 0$. Applying this to $\\widehat{G}_{<}$:\n$$-\\rho(A-B) + \\alpha(A+B) = 0 \\implies A(\\alpha-\\rho) + B(\\alpha+\\rho) = 0 \\implies B = A \\frac{\\rho-\\alpha}{\\rho+\\alpha}$$\nThe solution must be continuous at $x_n=y_n$, and its derivative must have a jump determined by integrating the ODE across the delta function. The jump condition is $\\partial_{x_n}\\widehat{G}|_{y_n^+} - \\partial_{x_n}\\widehat{G}|_{y_n^-} = -\\exp(-i\\xi\\cdot y')$.\nThese conditions are satisfied by a general solution of the form:\n$$\\widehat{G}(\\xi,x_n;y) = \\widehat{G}_{\\text{direct}}(\\xi,x_n;y) + \\widehat{G}_{\\text{image}}(\\xi,x_n;y)$$\nwhere $\\widehat{G}_{\\text{direct}}$ is the solution in free space, driven by the source, and $\\widehat{G}_{\\text{image}}$ is a solution to the homogeneous ODE, added to satisfy the boundary condition. The free-space solution (1D Green's function for $\\partial_{x_n}^2 - \\rho^2$) is $\\frac{1}{2\\rho}\\exp(-\\rho|x_n-y_n|)$.\nSo, $\\widehat{G}$ must have the form:\n$$\\widehat{G}(\\xi,x_n;y) = \\frac{\\exp(-i\\xi\\cdot y')}{2\\rho} \\exp(-\\rho|x_n-y_n|) + G_{image}(\\xi,x_n;y)$$\nThe image term $G_{image}$ must be a solution of the homogeneous equation, so it must be of the form $K \\exp(-\\rho x_n)$ to decay at infinity.

It is a standard problem in the field of partial differential equations and harmonic analysis. All terms are well-defined, and the premises are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The problem is well-posed and objective. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the harmonic extension $u$ of a spherical harmonic $f=Y_{l,k}$ into the ball $B^n$ and then compute its normal derivative at the boundary.\n\nWe use separation of variables in spherical coordinates $(r, \\omega)$, where $r \\in [0, \\infty)$ is the radial coordinate and $\\omega \\in S^{n-1}$ are the angular coordinates. The Laplace operator in these coordinates is given by:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{n-1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\Delta_{S^{n-1}} $$\nWe seek a solution $u(r, \\omega)$ to $\\Delta u = 0$ of the form $u(r, \\omega) = R(r) \\phi(\\omega)$. Substituting this into the Laplace equation gives:\n$$ \\left( R''(r) + \\frac{n-1}{r} R'(r) \\right) \\phi(\\omega) + \\frac{1}{r^2} R(r) \\Delta_{S^{n-1}} \\phi(\\omega) = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $r^2$ and dividing by $R(r)\\phi(\\omega)$ separates the variables:\n$$ \\frac{r^2 R''(r) + (n-1)r R'(r)}{R(r)} = - \\frac{\\Delta_{S^{n-1}} \\phi(\\omega)}{\\phi(\\omega)} $$\nSince the left side depends only on $r$ and the right side only on $\\omega$, both must be equal to a constant, which we denote by $\\lambda$.\n\nThe angular part of the problem becomes the eigenvalue problem for the Laplace-Beltrami operator: $\\Delta_{S^{n-1}} \\phi = -\\lambda \\phi$. The problem states that the solutions are the spherical harmonics $Y_{l,k}$, with corresponding eigenvalues $\\lambda = l(l+n-2)$. So, we set $\\phi(\\omega) = Y_{l,k}(\\omega)$.\n\nThe radial part becomes the following ordinary differential equation for $R(r)$:\n$$ r^2 R''(r) + (n-1)r R'(r) - l(l+n-2) R(r) = 0 $$\nThis is an Euler-Cauchy equation. We seek a solution of the form $R(r) = r^p$. Substituting this into the equation yields the indicial equation for $p$:\n$$ p(p-1) + (n-1)p - l(l+n-2) = 0 $$\n$$ p^2 + (n-2)p - l(l+n-2) = 0 $$\nThis quadratic equation can be factored as $(p-l)(p + l+n-2) = 0$. The roots are $p_1 = l$ and $p_2 = -(l+n-2)$.\nThe general solution for the radial function is thus:\n$$ R(r) = c_1 r^l + c_2 r^{-(l+n-2)} $$\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants.\n\nThe solution $u$ must be regular (bounded) inside the unit ball $B^n$, which includes the origin $r=0$. The term $r^{-(l+n-2)}$ diverges as $r \\to 0$ for any $l \\in \\mathbb{N}_0$ and $n \\ge 2$, except for the trivial case where the exponent is zero ($l=0, n=2$). In general, for a regular solution at the origin, we must set $c_2=0$.\nTherefore, the radial solution is $R(r) = c_1 r^l$.\n\nThe harmonic function inside the ball is of the form $u(r, \\omega) = c_1 r^l Y_{l,k}(\\omega)$. We now apply the Dirichlet boundary condition $u|_{\\partial B^n} = Y_{l,k}$. At the boundary $S^{n-1}$, we have $r=1$:\n$$ u(1, \\omega) = c_1 (1)^l Y_{l,k}(\\omega) = c_1 Y_{l,k}(\\omega) $$\nComparing this to the boundary data $f(\\omega) = Y_{l,k}(\\omega)$, we get $c_1 = 1$.\nThus, the harmonic extension of $Y_{l,k}$ into the unit ball is given by:\n$$ u(r, \\omega) = r^l Y_{l,k}(\\omega) $$\n\nNow we can compute the action of the DtN map $\\Lambda$. The outward normal vector on the unit sphere is $\\nu = \\hat{r}$, so the normal derivative is $\\partial_\\nu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(r^l Y_{l,k}(\\omega)\\right) = l r^{l-1} Y_{l,k}(\\omega) $$\nThe DtN map evaluates this derivative at the boundary $r=1$:\n$$ \\Lambda (Y_{l,k}) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=1} = l (1)^{l-1} Y_{l,k}(\\omega) = l Y_{l,k}(\\omega) $$\nBy comparing this with the form $\\Lambda Y_{l,k} = s(l) Y_{l,k}$, we identify the spectral multiplier for the DtN map as:\n$$ s(l) = l $$\n\nNext, we compute the action of the Robin operator $\\mathcal{R}_{\\alpha}$. By definition:\n$$ \\mathcal{R}_{\\alpha} f = \\partial_{\\nu} u|_{\\partial B^{n}} + \\alpha f $$\nFor $f = Y_{l,k}$, the first term is simply the action of the DtN map we just calculated: $\\partial_{\\nu} u|_{\\partial B^{n}} = \\Lambda(Y_{l,k}) = l Y_{l,k}$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\mathcal{R}_{\\alpha}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{R}_{\\alpha} (Y_{l,k}) = l Y_{l,k}(\\omega) + \\alpha Y_{l,k}(\\omega) = (l+\\alpha) Y_{l,k}(\\omega) $$\nComparing this with the form $\\mathcal{R}_{\\alpha} Y_{l,k} = s_{\\alpha}(l) Y_{l,k}$, we identify the spectral multiplier for the Robin operator as:\n$$ s_{\\alpha}(l) = l + \\alpha $$\n\nThe problem asks for the pair of spectral multipliers $s(l)$ and $s_{\\alpha}(l)$. These are $l$ and $l+\\alpha$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nl & l+\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3027734"}]}
