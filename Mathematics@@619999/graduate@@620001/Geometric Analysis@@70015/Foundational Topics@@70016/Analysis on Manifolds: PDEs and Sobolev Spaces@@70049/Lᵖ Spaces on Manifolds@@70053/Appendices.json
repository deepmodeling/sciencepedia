Second, we will compute the explicit value of the $L^{p}$ norm for $p \\in [1, \\infty)$ under the specified additional assumption.\n\n**Part 1: Verification that $f \\in L^{p}(M, \\mu_g)$ for all $p \\in [1, \\infty]$**\n\nWe must show that the norm $\\|f\\|_{L^{p}(M)}$ is finite for every $p$ in the interval $[1, \\infty]$. We consider the cases $p = \\infty$ and $p \\in [1, \\infty)$ separately.\n\nCase 1: $p=\\infty$.\nThe definition of the $L^{\\infty}$ norm is the essential supremum of the function's absolute value.\n$$ \\|f\\|_{L^{\\infty}(M)} = \\operatorname{ess\\,sup}_{x \\in M} |f(x)| $$\nThe problem statement explicitly provides that this quantity is finite, defining it as $A$:\n$$ A := \\operatorname{ess\\,sup}_{x \\in M} |f(x)| < \\infty $$\nBy definition, a measurable function $f$ is in $L^{\\infty}(M, \\mu_g)$ if and only if its $L^{\\infty}$ norm is finite. Since $\\|f\\|_{L^{\\infty}(M)} = A$, which is finite, we conclude that $f \\in L^{\\infty}(M, \\mu_g)$.\n\nCase 2: $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\nFor a function $f$ to be in $L^{p}(M, \\mu_g)$, its $L^p$ norm must be finite. The norm is defined as:\n$$ \\|f\\|_{L^{p}(M)} = \\left( \\int_M |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nThis norm is finite if and only if the integral $\\int_M |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g$ is finite. Let us evaluate this integral.\n\nThe problem states that the support of $f$, denoted $\\operatorname{supp}(f)$, is a subset of the compact set $K$. The support is defined as the closure of the set of points where $f$ is non-zero, i.e., $\\operatorname{supp}(f) = \\overline{\\{x \\in M \\mid f(x) \\neq 0\\}}$. This implies that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\notin \\operatorname{supp}(f)$. Since $\\operatorname{supp}(f) \\subseteq K$, it follows that $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in M \\setminus K$. Consequently, the integrand $|f(x)|^p$ is zero everywhere outside of $K$. We can therefore restrict the domain of integration from $M$ to $K$:\n$$ \\int_M |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g = \\int_K |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g $$\nFrom the definition of the essential supremum $A$, we have the inequality $|f(x)| \\le A$ for $\\mu_g$-almost every $x \\in M$. Since $p \\ge 1$, the power function $t \\mapsto t^p$ is monotonically non-decreasing for non-negative $t$. Thus, we can state that $|f(x)|^p \\le A^p$ for $\\mu_g$-almost every $x \\in M$, and therefore for $\\mu_g$-almost every $x \\in K$.\n\nBy the monotonicity property of the Lebesgue integral, we can bound our integral:\n$$ \\int_K |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g \\le \\int_K A^p \\,d\\mu_g $$\nSince $A^p$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$ \\int_K A^p \\,d\\mu_g = A^p \\int_K 1 \\,d\\mu_g = A^p \\mu_g(K) $$\nThe quantity $\\mu_g(K)$ is the volume of the set $K$ with respect to the Riemannian volume measure $\\mu_g$. A fundamental property of a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is that its volume measure $\\mu_g$ is a Radon measure. A defining characteristic of a Radon measure on a Hausdorff topological space (which a manifold is) is that it assigns finite measure to every compact set. As $K$ is given to be a compact subset of $M$, its volume $\\mu_g(K)$ must be finite.\n$$ \\mu_g(K) < \\infty $$\nCombining our results, we have the following chain of inequalities:\n$$ \\int_M |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g = \\int_K |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g \\le \\int_K A^p \\,d\\mu_g = A^p \\mu_g(K) $$\nSince $A$ is finite (by hypothesis) and $\\mu_g(K)$ is finite (as a property of Radon measures on compact sets), their product $A^p \\mu_g(K)$ is finite. This establishes that the integral $\\int_M |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g$ is finite. Therefore, its $p$-th root, $\\|f\\|_{L^{p}(M)}$, is also finite. This completes the proof that $f \\in L^{p}(M, \\mu_g)$ for all $p \\in [1, \\infty)$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $\\|f\\|_{L^{p}(M)}$ for $p \\in [1, \\infty)$**\n\nWe are now given the additional assumption that $|f(x)|=A$ for $\\mu_g$-almost every $x \\in K$. We are asked to compute the exact value of $\\|f\\|_{L^{p}(M)}$ for a fixed $p \\in [1,\\infty)$.\n\nAs before, the norm is calculated from the integral:\n$$ \\|f\\|_{L^{p}(M)} = \\left( \\int_M |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nAnd, as before, because $\\operatorname{supp}(f) \\subseteq K$, the integral reduces to an integral over $K$:\n$$ \\int_M |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g = \\int_K |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g $$\nNow, we apply the additional assumption. The condition $|f(x)| = A$ for $\\mu_g$-almost every $x \\in K$ implies that $|f(x)|^p = A^p$ for $\\mu_g$-almost every $x \\in K$. In Lebesgue integration, if two non-negative measurable functions are equal almost everywhere on a set, their integrals over that set are identical. Therefore, we can replace the integrand $|f(x)|^p$ with the constant $A^p$:\n$$ \\int_K |f(x)|^p \\,d\\mu_g = \\int_K A^p \\,d\\mu_g $$\nFactoring out the constant $A^p$:\n$$ \\int_K A^p \\,d\\mu_g = A^p \\int_K 1 \\,d\\mu_g = A^p \\mu_g(K) $$\nThe problem defines $V := \\mu_g(K)$. Substituting this notation, the value of the integral is $A^p V$.\n\nFinally, to find the norm, we take the $p$-th root of this result:\n$$ \\|f\\|_{L^{p}(M)} = \\left( A^p V \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nUsing the property of exponents $(ab)^c = a^c b^c$, and noting that $A$ and $V$ are non-negative, we get:\n$$ \\|f\\|_{L^{p}(M)} = (A^p)^{\\frac{1}{p}} V^{\\frac{1}{p}} = A V^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the norm under the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A V^{\\frac{1}{p}}}$$", "id": "3032005"}, {"introduction": "While bounded functions on compact sets are well-behaved, many interesting functions in geometric analysis, such as fundamental solutions to differential equations, exhibit singularities.

Let's denote it by $c_p$. Then $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left\\|f_{n}\\right\\|_{L^{p}} = c_p \\neq 0$.\nThus, the sequence $\\left(f_{n}\\right)$ converges weakly to $0$ but does not converge strongly to $0$.\n\n### Part (iii): Computation of the Limit\n\nWe are asked to compute $L = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^{1}} f_{n}\\!\\left(\\theta\\right)\\,g_{0}\\!\\left(\\theta\\right)\\,d\\theta$, where $f_{n}\\left(\\theta\\right)=\\sin\\left(n\\theta\\right)$ and $g_{0}\\left(\\theta\\right)=\\mathbf{1}_{\\left[0,\\pi\\right]}\\left(\\theta\\right)$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that $g_{0}$ is in the dual space $L^{q}\\!\\left(\\mathbb{S}^{1}\\right)$. We compute its $L^{q}$-norm:\n$$\n\\left\\|g_{0}\\right\\|_{L^{q}}^{q} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left|g_{0}\\left(\\theta\\right)\\right|^{q}\\,d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left|\\mathbf{1}_{\\left[0,\\pi\\right]}\\left(\\theta\\right)\\right|^{q}\\,d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} 1^{q}\\,d\\theta = \\pi.\n$$\nSince $\\pi  \\infty$, we have $\\left\\|g_{0}\\right\\|_{L^{q}} = \\pi^{1/q}  \\infty$, so $g_{0} \\in L^{q}\\!\\left(\\mathbb{S}^{1}\\right)$.\n\nFrom part (ii), we established that the sequence $f_{n}\\left(\\theta\\right) = \\sin\\left(n\\theta\\right)$ converges weakly to the zero function, $f\\left(\\theta\\right)=0$.\nFrom part (i), this means that for any $g \\in L^{q}\\!\\left(\\mathbb{S}^{1}\\right)$, we have:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^{1}} f_{n}\\left(\\theta\\right)g\\left(\\theta\\right)\\,d\\theta = \\int_{\\mathbb{S}^{1}} 0 \\cdot g\\left(\\theta\\right)\\,d\\theta = 0.\n$$\nSince $g_{0} \\in L^{q}\\!\\left(\\mathbb{S}^{1}\\right)$, we can apply this result directly with $g=g_{0}$. Therefore,\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^{1}} \\sin\\left(n\\theta\\right)\\mathbf{1}_{\\left[0,\\pi\\right]}\\left(\\theta\\right)\\,d\\theta = 0.\n$$\nWe can verify this by direct computation of the integral for each $n$:\n$$\nI_{n} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin\\left(n\\theta\\right)\\mathbf{1}_{\\left[0,\\pi\\right]}\\left(\\theta\\right)\\,d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\left(n\\theta\\right)\\,d\\theta.\n$$\nFor $n\\ge 1$, this evaluates to:\n$$\nI_{n} = \\left[-\\frac{\\cos\\left(n\\theta\\right)}{n}\\right]_{0}^{\\pi} = -\\frac{\\cos\\left(n\\pi\\right)}{n} - \\left(-\\frac{\\cos\\left(0\\right)}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1-\\cos\\left(n\\pi\\right)}{n} = \\frac{1-\\left(-1\\right)^{n}}{n}.\n$$\nThe sequence of values is $I_{1}=\\frac{2}{1}$, $I_{2}=0$, $I_{3}=\\frac{2}{3}$, $I_{4}=0$, etc.\nIn general, $\\left|I_{n}\\right| \\le \\frac{1+\\left|\\left(-1\\right)^{n}\\right|}{n} = \\frac{2}{n}$.\nAs $n\\to\\infty$, $\\frac{2}{n}\\to 0$, so by the squeeze theorem, $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} I_{n} = 0$.\nThe limit is $L=0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3032029"}]}
