The norm on a manifold is defined via an atlas and the corresponding norms of the function's pullbacks in local charts.\n\nFirst, let us state the definition of the $C^{k,\\alpha}$ norm for a function on a compact manifold $M$. Let $\\mathcal{A} = \\{(U_i, \\varphi_i)\\}_i$ be a finite atlas for $M$, where each $U_i$ is an open set in $M$ and $\\varphi_i: U_i \\to V_i \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a chart map. The $C^{k,\\alpha}(M)$ norm of a function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as the supremum of the local chart-induced norms:\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{C^{k,\\alpha}(M)} = \\sup_i \\|f \\circ \\varphi_i^{-1}\\|_{C^{k,\\alpha}(V_i)}\n$$\nIn this problem, $M=S^2$, $k=1$, and the atlas consists of two charts: $(\\varphi_N, S^2 \\setminus \\{N\\})$ and $(\\varphi_S, S^2 \\setminus \\{S\\})$, where $N$ and $S$ are the north and south poles, respectively. The chart domains are $U_N = S^2 \\setminus \\{N\\}$ and $U_S = S^2 \\setminus \\{S\\}$. Both charts map to the entire plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, so $V_N = V_S = \\mathbb{R}^2$. The norm of $f$ on $S^2$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{C^{1,\\alpha}(S^2)} = \\max\\left( \\|f \\circ \\varphi_N^{-1}\\|_{C^{1,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)}, \\|f \\circ \\varphi_S^{-1}\\|_{C^{1,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)} \\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we establish the definition of the norm on the chart space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. For a function $g: U \\to \\mathbb{R}$ on an open set $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$, the \"standard\" $C^{k,\\alpha}(U)$ norm is often defined in slightly different but equivalent ways. We will use a common definition from the theory of partial differential equations. For $k=1$ and $n=2$, the norm of a function $g: U \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is:\n$$\n\\|g\\|_{C^{1,\\alpha}(U)} = \\|g\\|_{C^1(U)} + \\sum_{i=1}^2 [\\partial_i g]_{C^{0,\\alpha}(U)}\n$$\nwhere $\\|g\\|_{C^1(U)} = \\|g\\|_{C^0(U)} + \\sum_{i=1}^2 \\|\\partial_i g\\|_{C^0(U)}$. The individual components are the supremum norm $\\|h\\|_{C^0(U)} = \\sup_{x \\in U} |h(x)|$ and the Hölder seminorm $[h]_{C^{0,\\alpha}(U)} = \\sup_{x,y \\in U, x \\ne y} \\frac{|h(x) - h(y)|}{|x-y|^{\\alpha}}$.\n\nThe given function is $f: S^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(p) = 1$ for all points $p \\in S^2$. This is a constant function. We need to compute the norms of its pullbacks via the two stereographic projections.\n\nLet's first consider the north chart $\\varphi_N: S^2 \\setminus \\{N\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$. The pullback function is $g_N = f \\circ \\varphi_N^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$. For any point $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the map $\\varphi_N^{-1}$ gives a point $p_x = \\varphi_N^{-1}(x)$ on the sphere $S^2$ (specifically, in $S^2 \\setminus \\{N\\}$). The function $g_N$ is then evaluated as $g_N(x) = f(p_x)$. Since $f(p)=1$ for all $p \\in S^2$, it follows that $g_N(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, the pullback $g_N$ is the constant function $1$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nNow, we compute the $C^{1,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ norm of $g_N(x) = 1$.\nThe terms of the norm are:\n1.  The $C^0$ norm of $g_N$:\n    $\\|g_N\\|_{C^0(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} |g_N(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} |1| = 1$.\n2.  The partial derivatives of $g_N$: Let $x=(x_1, x_2)$.\n    $\\partial_1 g_N(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1}(1) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    $\\partial_2 g_N(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2}(1) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n3.  The $C^0$ norms of the partial derivatives:\n    $\\|\\partial_1 g_N\\|_{C^0(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} |0| = 0$.\n    $\\|\\partial_2 g_N\\|_{C^0(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2} |0| = 0$.\n4. The Hölder seminorms of the partial derivatives. For $\\partial_1 g_N = 0$:\n    $[\\partial_1 g_N]_{C^{0,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = \\sup_{x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2, x \\ne y} \\frac{|\\partial_1 g_N(x) - \\partial_1 g_N(y)|}{|x-y|^{\\alpha}} = \\sup_{x \\ne y} \\frac{|0 - 0|}{|x-y|^{\\alpha}} = 0$.\n    Similarly, $[\\partial_2 g_N]_{C^{0,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = 0$.\n\nCombining these terms, the full $C^{1,\\alpha}$ norm for the north chart pullback is:\n$$\n\\|g_N\\|_{C^{1,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = \\|g_N\\|_{C^0} + \\|\\partial_1 g_N\\|_{C^0} + \\|\\partial_2 g_N\\|_{C^0} + [\\partial_1 g_N]_{C^{0,\\alpha}} + [\\partial_2 g_N]_{C^{0,\\alpha}} = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.\n$$\n\nNext, we perform the same calculation for the south chart $\\varphi_S: S^2 \\setminus \\{S\\} \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$. The pullback is $g_S = f \\circ \\varphi_S^{-1}: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$. By the same reasoning as for the north chart, for any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, $g_S(y) = f(\\varphi_S^{-1}(y)) = 1$. So, $g_S$ is also the constant function $1$ on $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe calculation of the $C^{1,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$ norm for $g_S$ is identical to that for $g_N$, as both are the same constant function on $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\|g_S\\|_{C^{1,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)} = 1.\n$$\nThis verifies that the values of the norm computed in the north and south charts are equivalent, as they are both equal to $1$.\n\nFinally, the $C^{1,\\alpha}$ norm of the function $f$ on the sphere $S^2$ is the maximum of the norms computed in the charts of the atlas:\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{C^{1,\\alpha}(S^2)} = \\max\\left( \\|f \\circ \\varphi_N^{-1}\\|_{C^{1,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)}, \\|f \\circ \\varphi_S^{-1}\\|_{C^{1,\\alpha}(\\mathbb{R}^2)} \\right) = \\max(1, 1) = 1.\n$$\nThe final result is a single real number.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3030835"}, {"introduction": "A key result for function spaces on compact domains is the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem, which guarantees that a sequence bounded in a higher-order norm has a convergent subsequence in a lower-order norm.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the tasks in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Boundedness of $\\{u_j\\}$ in $C^{k,\\alpha}(M)$**\n\nThe norm on $C^{k,\\alpha}(M)$ is defined via a partition of unity over charts. However, due to the product structure of $M=S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$, we can analyze the behavior of the derivatives directly. The norm $\\|u\\|_{C^{k,\\alpha}(M)}$ is equivalent to the sum of the supremum norms of all partial derivatives up to order $k$, plus the Hölder seminorm of the $k$-th order partial derivatives.\n\nLet $\\partial_{\\theta}^{a} \\partial_{t}^{b}$ be a partial differential operator of order $a+b \\leq k$. Applying this to $u_j(\\theta,t) = p_m(t-j)\\cos(\\theta)$, we get\n$$ \\partial_{\\theta}^{a} \\partial_{t}^{b} u_j(\\theta,t) = \\left(\\frac{d^b}{dt^b} p_m(t-j)\\right) \\left(\\frac{d^a}{d\\theta^a}\\cos(\\theta)\\right) = p_m^{(b)}(t-j) \\cdot \\cos^{(a)}(\\theta). $$\nLet $s=t-j$. Then $p_m^{(b)}(t-j) = p_m^{(b)}(s)$. The function $p_m(s) = (1-s^2)_{+}^m$ is supported on $[-1,1]$. Since $m \\geq k+1$, $p_m(s)$ is a $C^m$ function, and thus is at least $C^{k+1}$. All its derivatives $p_m^{(b)}(s)$ for $b \\leq k+1$ are continuous functions on the compact interval $[-1,1]$ and zero elsewhere. Therefore, they are bounded on $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $C_b = \\sup_{s\\in\\mathbb{R}} |p_m^{(b)}(s)|  \\infty$. The derivatives of $\\cos(\\theta)$ are either $\\pm\\cos(\\theta)$ or $\\pm\\sin(\\theta)$, so $|\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta)| \\leq 1$.\n\nFor any derivative of order $l=a+b \\leq k$, its supremum norm is\n$$ \\sup_{(\\theta,t)\\in M} |\\partial_{\\theta}^{a} \\partial_{t}^{b} u_j(\\theta,t)| = \\sup_{s \\in \\mathbb{R}} |p_m^{(b)}(s)| \\cdot \\sup_{\\theta \\in S^1} |\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta)| \\leq C_b \\cdot 1 = C_b. $$\nThis bound is independent of $j$. Summing over all $a,b$ with $a+b \\leq k$ gives a uniform bound on the $C^k$ part of the norm.\n\nNext, we consider the Hölder seminorm for a $k$-th order derivative, $v_j = \\partial_{\\theta}^{a} \\partial_{t}^{b} u_j$ with $a+b=k$. Since $m \\geq k+1$, $p_m^{(b)}(s)$ is a $C^{m-b}$ function. As $b \\leq k$, $m-b \\geq 1$, so $p_m^{(b)}(s)$ is at least $C^1$. Its derivative, $p_m^{(b+1)}(s)$, is continuous and compactly supported, hence bounded by some constant $C_{b+1}$. By the Mean Value Theorem, $p_m^{(b)}(s)$ is Lipschitz continuous: $|p_m^{(b)}(s_1) - p_m^{(b)}(s_2)| \\leq C_{b+1} |s_1-s_2|$.\nSimilarly, $\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta)$ is a $C^\\infty$ function on the compact manifold $S^1$, so it is Lipschitz: $|\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta_1)-\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta_2)| \\leq C_a d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)$.\n\nLet $x_1 = (\\theta_1, t_1)$ and $x_2 = (\\theta_2, t_2)$. The derivative is $v_j(\\theta,t) = p_m^{(b)}(t-j)\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta)$.\n\\begin{align*} |v_j(x_1) - v_j(x_2)| = |p_m^{(b)}(t_1-j)\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta_1) - p_m^{(b)}(t_2-j)\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta_2)| \\\\ \\leq |p_m^{(b)}(t_1-j) - p_m^{(b)}(t_2-j)||\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta_1)| + |p_m^{(b)}(t_2-j)||\\cos^{(a)}(\\theta_1) - \\cos^{(a)}(\\theta_2)| \\\\ \\leq (C_{b+1}|t_1 - t_2|) \\cdot 1 + C_b \\cdot (C_a d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)) \\\\ \\leq \\max(C_{b+1}, C_b C_a) (|t_1-t_2| + d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)). \\end{align*}\nThe distance on $M$ is $d(x_1, x_2) = \\sqrt{d_{S^1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)^2 + (t_1-t_2)^2}$. We have $|t_1-t_2| \\leq d(x_1,x_2)$ and $d_{S^1}(\\theta_1,\\theta_2) \\leq d(x_1,x_2)$. Thus,\n$$ |v_j(x_1) - v_j(x_2)| \\leq K d(x_1, x_2) $$\nfor some constant $K$ independent of $j$. This shows that all $k$-th derivatives are uniformly Lipschitz continuous (i.e., $1$-Hölder continuous). For any $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, this implies uniform $\\alpha$-Hölder continuity:\n$$ \\frac{|v_j(x_1) - v_j(x_2)|}{d(x_1, x_2)^\\alpha} \\leq K d(x_1, x_2)^{1-\\alpha}. $$\nThe Hölder seminorm involves a supremum over pairs of points. When defined locally (e.g., $d(x_1, x_2)1$), the seminorm is bounded by $K$, independent of $j$. Combining the bounds on derivatives and the Hölder seminorms, we conclude that the sequence $\\{u_j\\}$ is bounded in $C^{k,\\alpha}(M)$.\n\n**Part 2: Non-existence of a Convergent Subsequence**\n\nWe will show that $\\{u_j\\}$ is not a Cauchy sequence in $C^0(M)$, the space of bounded continuous functions on $M$ with the supremum norm $\\|u\\|_{C^0} = \\sup_{M} |u|$.\nConsider the distance between two distinct terms $u_j$ and $u_l$ for $j, l \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $l > j$.\n$$ \\|u_j - u_l\\|_{C^0} = \\sup_{(\\theta, t) \\in M} |p_m(t-j)\\cos(\\theta) - p_m(t-l)\\cos(\\theta)| = \\sup_{t \\in \\mathbb{R}} |p_m(t-j) - p_m(t-l)|. $$\nThe support of $u_j$ is $S^1 \\times [j-1, j+1]$ and the support of $u_l$ is $S^1 \\times [l-1, l+1]$. If we choose $l$ and $j$ such that their supports are disjoint, e.g., $l-1 > j+1$ or $l > j+2$, then for any given $t$, at most one of $p_m(t-j)$ and $p_m(t-l)$ is non-zero.\nIn this case, $|p_m(t-j) - p_m(t-l)|$ is $p_m(t-j)$ on $[j-1, j+1]$ and $p_m(t-l)$ on $[l-1, l+1]$.\nThe maximum value of $p_m(s)$ is $p_m(0) = (1-0)^m = 1$.\nSo, $\\sup_{t \\in \\mathbb{R}} |p_m(t-j) - p_m(t-l)| = \\max(\\sup_t p_m(t-j), \\sup_t p_m(t-l)) = \\max(1,1)=1$.\nTherefore, for any $j$ and any $l > j+2$, we have $\\|u_j - u_l\\|_{C^0} = 1$.\nThis implies that no subsequence of $\\{u_j\\}$ can be a Cauchy sequence. If it were, for any $\\epsilon > 0$, say $\\epsilon = 1/2$, there would exist an $N$ such that for all $j_n, j_p > N$, $\\|u_{j_n} - u_{j_p}\\|_{C^0}  1/2$. But we can always find two indices greater than $N$ separated by more than $2$, for which the norm is $1$.\nSince no subsequence is Cauchy, no subsequence can converge in $C^0(M)$. As convergence in $C^{k,\\beta}(M)$ implies convergence in $C^0(M)$, there can be no convergent subsequence in $C^{k,\\beta}(M)$ either.\n\nThis behavior demonstrates the failure of compact embeddings on non-compact manifolds. For a sequence of functions to have a convergent subsequence in $C^0(M)$, the Arzela-Ascoli theorem requires three conditions: uniform boundedness, equicontinuity, and **tightness**. Tightness means that for any $\\epsilon0$, there exists a compact set $K_\\epsilon \\subset M$ such that $\\sup_{j} \\sup_{x \\in M \\setminus K_\\epsilon} |u_j(x)|  \\epsilon$.\nOur sequence $\\{u_j\\}$ is bounded and equicontinuous (as shown in Part 1). However, it is not tight. The \"bump\" of each function $u_j$ is centered at $t=j$ and has a maximum value of $1$. As $j \\to \\infty$, this bump \"escapes to infinity\" along the non-compact direction of $M$. For any fixed compact set $K \\subset M$, which must be contained in some $S^1 \\times [-R, R]$, we can find $J$ such that for all $j > J$, the support of $u_j$ is disjoint from $K$. Then for $j>J$, $\\sup_{x \\in M \\setminus K} |u_j(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in M} |u_j(x)| = 1$. This cannot be made arbitrarily small, so the tightness condition fails. This failure is the reason why the compact embedding $C^{k,\\alpha}(M) \\hookrightarrow C^0(M)$, which holds for compact $M$, fails for the non-compact cylinder $M$.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of $L$**\n\nWe need to compute $L = \\lim_{j\\to\\infty} \\int_{M} \\bigl|u_{j}(\\theta,t)\\bigr|^{2}\\, d\\theta \\, dt$.\nLet's first compute the integral for a fixed $j$:\n$$ I_j = \\int_{M} |u_j(\\theta,t)|^2 \\, d\\theta \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} |p_m(t-j)\\cos(\\theta)|^2 \\, d\\theta \\, dt. $$\nBy Fubini's theorem, we can separate the integrals:\n$$ I_j = \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (p_m(t-j))^2 \\, dt \\right). $$\nThe first integral is standard:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\cos^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2} \\, d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{\\theta}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{4}\\right]_0^{2\\pi} = \\pi. $$\nFor the second integral, we make the substitution $s = t-j$, so $ds = dt$. The limits of integration remain $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (p_m(t-j))^2 \\, dt = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (p_m(s))^2 \\, ds. $$\nThis integral is independent of $j$. Therefore, $I_j$ is independent of $j$, and the limit $L$ is simply the value of the integral for any $j$.\n$$ L = \\pi \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (p_m(s))^2 \\, ds. $$\nUsing the definition $p_m(s) = (1-s^2)_+^m$, the integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (p_m(s))^2 \\, ds = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left((1-s^2)^m\\right)^2 \\, ds = \\int_{-1}^{1} (1-s^2)^{2m} \\, ds. $$\nThis is a known integral related to the Beta function. In general, $\\int_{-1}^{1} (1-x^2)^N dx = \\frac{2^{2N+1} (N!)^2}{(2N+1)!}$.\nIn our case, $N = 2m$.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed and deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in Riemannian geometry and the theory of partial differential equations, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, solvable problem in geometric analysis.\n\nLet the manifold be $M = \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for $n \\geq 2$, equipped with the Riemannian metric $g = \\lambda(x)^{2} \\delta$, where $\\delta$ is the standard Euclidean metric with components $\\delta_{ij}$, and $\\lambda(x) = \\exp(|x|)$, with $|x|$ being the Euclidean norm in $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$. The components of the metric tensor $g$ are $g_{ij}(x) = \\lambda(x)^{2} \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{-1}$ has components $g^{ij}(x)$ which are the entries of the inverse matrix of $(g_{ij})$. Thus, $g^{ij}(x) = \\lambda(x)^{-2} \\delta^{ij}$, where $\\delta^{ij} = \\delta_{ij}$.\n\nThe determinant of the metric tensor is $\\det(g) = \\det(\\lambda(x)^{2} \\delta_{ij}) = (\\lambda(x)^{2})^{n} \\det(\\delta_{ij}) = \\lambda(x)^{2n}$. The volume element is determined by $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\lambda(x)^{n}$.\n\nThe Laplace–Beltrami operator $\\Delta_{g}$ acting on a scalar function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is defined as the divergence of the gradient, $\\Delta_{g} f = \\text{div}_{g}(\\nabla_{g} f)$. In local coordinates $x^1, \\dots, x^n$, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\Delta_{g} f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g)}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\det(g)} \\, g^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right)\n$$\nHere, we use the Einstein summation convention. Substituting the expressions for our specific metric:\n$$\n\\Delta_{g} f = \\frac{1}{\\lambda(x)^{n}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( \\lambda(x)^{n} \\lambda(x)^{-2} \\delta^{ij} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{j}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda(x)^{n}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\left( \\lambda(x)^{n-2} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the divergence form of the operator. To obtain the non-divergence form, we apply the product rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\Delta_{g} f = \\frac{1}{\\lambda(x)^{n}} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\lambda(x)^{n-2} \\right) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}} + \\lambda(x)^{n-2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial (x^{i})^{2}} \\right]\n$$\nRearranging terms to match the standard non-divergence form $a^{ij}(x) \\partial_{i} \\partial_{j}f + \\dots$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{g} f = \\frac{\\lambda(x)^{n-2}}{\\lambda(x)^{n}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial (x^{i})^{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda(x)^{n}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i}} \\lambda(x)^{n-2} \\right) \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^{i}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{g} f = \\lambda(x)^{-2} \\Delta_{\\delta}f + \\text{first-order terms}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\delta}f = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial (x^{i})^{2}} = \\delta^{ij} \\frac{\\partial^{2}f}{\\partial x^{i} \\partial x^{j}}$ is the standard Euclidean Laplacian. The principal part of the operator is the part with second-order derivatives. Thus, the coefficients of the principal part are:\n$$\na^{ij}(x) = \\lambda(x)^{-2} \\delta^{ij}\n$$\nThese are, as expected, the components of the inverse metric tensor $g^{ij}$.\n\nNext, we compute the global lower ellipticity bound $\\nu$, defined as:\n$$\n\\nu := \\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\ \\min_{\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\ \\frac{a^{ij}(x)\\, \\xi_{i}\\, \\xi_{j}}{|\\xi|^{2}}\n$$\nWe substitute the expression for $a^{ij}(x)$:\n$$\na^{ij}(x)\\, \\xi_{i}\\, \\xi_{j} = (\\lambda(x)^{-2} \\delta^{ij}) \\xi_{i}\\, \\xi_{j} = \\lambda(x)^{-2} (\\delta^{ij} \\xi_{i}\\, \\xi_{j}) = \\lambda(x)^{-2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_{i}^{2} = \\lambda(x)^{-2} |\\xi|^{2}\n$$\nThe ratio inside the definition of $\\nu$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{a^{ij}(x)\\, \\xi_{i}\\, \\xi_{j}}{|\\xi|^{2}} = \\frac{\\lambda(x)^{-2} |\\xi|^{2}}{|\\xi|^{2}} = \\lambda(x)^{-2}\n$$\nThis quantity is independent of $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. Therefore, the inner minimum is simply $\\lambda(x)^{-2}$.\nNow we must compute the infimum over all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$:\n$$\n\\nu = \\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\lambda(x)^{-2}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\lambda(x) = \\exp(|x|)$:\n$$\n\\nu = \\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}} (\\exp(|x|))^{-2} = \\inf_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}} \\exp(-2|x|)\n$$\nThe function $h(t) = \\exp(-2t)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $t \\ge 0$. The domain of $|x|$ is $[0, \\infty)$. The infimum of $\\exp(-2|x|)$ is attained as $|x| \\to \\infty$.\n$$\n\\lim_{|x| \\to \\infty} \\exp(-2|x|) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\exp(-2|x|) > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, the greatest lower bound is $0$.\nThus, the global lower ellipticity bound is $\\nu = 0$.\n\nFinally, we address the issues of bounded geometry and Schauder estimates.\nA Riemannian manifold is said to have bounded geometry if its sectional curvatures are bounded and its injectivity radius is bounded below by a positive constant. A simpler check in a given coordinate system is to inspect the metric components and their derivatives. In the global Euclidean chart, the metric components are $g_{ij}(x) = \\exp(2|x|)\\delta_{ij}$. As $|x| \\to \\infty$, the components $g_{ij}(x) \\to \\infty$. The metric components themselves are unbounded. The derivatives of the metric components, which determine the curvature tensor, also grow exponentially. For instance, the second partial derivatives of $g_{ij}$ with respect to the coordinates $x^k$ contain terms proportional to $\\exp(2|x|)$, which are unbounded. Unbounded derivatives of the metric imply unbounded curvature. Therefore, the manifold $(M,g)$ does not have bounded geometry.\n\nThe Schauder theory for elliptic partial differential equations provides estimates for the Hölder norms of solutions. A typical interior Schauder estimate for an equation like $\\Delta_g u = f$ is of the form $\\|u\\|_{C^{k,\\alpha}} \\le C (\\|f\\|_{C^{k-2,\\alpha}} + \\|u\\|_{C^0})$. For such an estimate to hold globally on the manifold $M$ with a uniform constant $C$, certain conditions on the operator and the manifold's geometry are required. Specifically, the operator must be uniformly elliptic, and the manifold must have bounded geometry.\nUniform ellipticity requires that the lower ellipticity bound $\\nu$ be strictly positive, i.e., $\\nu > 0$. The constant $C$ in the Schauder estimate is inversely proportional to this ellipticity constant, i.e., $C \\propto 1/\\nu$.\nIn our case, we computed $\\nu = 0$. This means the operator $\\Delta_g$ is not uniformly elliptic on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. While it is elliptic at every point $x$ (with local ellipticity constant $\\exp(-2|x|) > 0$), the ellipticity degenerates to zero as $|x| \\to \\infty$. Because the global lower bound is $\\nu = 0$, its conceptual inverse $1/\\nu$ is infinite. This obstructs the existence of a global Schauder estimate with a uniform constant $C$. Any local estimate on a bounded domain $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ would have a constant $C_U$ that depends on the infimum of $\\lambda(x)^{-2}$ over $U$, and this constant would blow up as $U$ expands to fill $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The value $\\nu=0$ is the precise quantification of this failure of uniform ellipticity, which is a primary reason why global Schauder estimates with a uniform constant do not hold for this operator on $(M,g)$. The lack of bounded geometry is the corresponding geometric obstruction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3030843"}]}
