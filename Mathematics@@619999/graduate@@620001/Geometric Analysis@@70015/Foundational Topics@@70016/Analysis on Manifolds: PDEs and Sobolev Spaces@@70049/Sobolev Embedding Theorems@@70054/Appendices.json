The solution will now be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n### Derivation\nOur goal is to compute $\\|u_{\\lambda}\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}$. We begin from its definition:\n$$ \\|u_{\\lambda}\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})} = \\left( \\sum_{|\\alpha| = k} \\|D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} $$\nThe core of the derivation is to understand the behavior of the term $\\|D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}$. Let's first analyze the derivative $D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}(x)$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be a multi-index with $|\\alpha| = k$. We must compute $D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}(x) = D^{\\alpha} u(\\lambda x)$. We use the multivariate chain rule. Let $y = \\lambda x$, so $y_j = \\lambda x_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, n$.\n\nFor a first-order derivative ($k=1$), let $\\alpha$ be $e_i$, the multi-index with a $1$ in the $i$-th position and $0$ elsewhere.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} u_{\\lambda}(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} u(\\lambda x) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y_j}(\\lambda x) \\frac{\\partial y_j}{\\partial x_i} $$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial y_j}{\\partial x_i} = \\frac{\\partial (\\lambda x_j)}{\\partial x_i} = \\lambda \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, the sum collapses to the term where $j=i$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} u_{\\lambda}(x) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y_i}(\\lambda x) \\cdot \\lambda = \\lambda (D^{e_i} u)(\\lambda x) $$\nWe can generalize this by induction. Assume for any multi-index $\\beta$ with $|\\beta| = m < k$, we have $D^{\\beta} u_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda^{m} (D^{\\beta} u)(\\lambda x)$. Let $\\alpha$ be a multi-index with $|\\alpha|=m+1$. We can write $\\alpha = \\beta + e_i$ for some $\\beta$ with $|\\beta|=m$ and some $i$.\n$$ D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}(x) = D^{e_i} (D^{\\beta} u_{\\lambda}(x)) = D^{e_i} \\left( \\lambda^{m} (D^{\\beta} u)(\\lambda x) \\right) $$\nApplying the single-derivative rule derived above to the function $v(x) = (D^{\\beta} u)(x)$:\n$$ D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda^{m} \\left( D^{e_i} (v(\\lambda x)) \\right) = \\lambda^{m} \\left( \\lambda (D^{e_i} v)(\\lambda x) \\right) = \\lambda^{m+1} (D^{e_i} D^{\\beta} u)(\\lambda x) = \\lambda^{m+1} (D^{\\alpha} u)(\\lambda x) $$\nBy induction, for any multi-index $\\alpha$ with order $|\\alpha|=k$, we have established the relationship:\n$$ D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}(x) = \\lambda^{k} (D^{\\alpha} u)(\\lambda x) $$\nNow, we compute the $L^{p}$-norm of this expression. The $p$-th power of the $L^p$-norm is given by:\n$$ \\|D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} |D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}(x)|^{p} \\, dx $$\nSubstituting our result for the derivative:\n$$ \\|D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} |\\lambda^{k} (D^{\\alpha} u)(\\lambda x)|^{p} \\, dx = \\lambda^{kp} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} |(D^{\\alpha} u)(\\lambda x)|^{p} \\, dx $$\nWe now apply the change-of-variables formula for the integral. Let $y = \\lambda x$. Then $x = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} y$, and the differential volume element transforms as $dx = |\\det(J)| \\, dy$, where $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of the transformation $x(y)$. The matrix of partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial x_i}{\\partial y_j}$ is a diagonal matrix with entries $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$.\n$$ J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\lambda & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/\\lambda & \\dots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\dots & 1/\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant is $\\det(J) = (\\frac{1}{\\lambda})^{n} = \\lambda^{-n}$. Since $\\lambda > 0$, the absolute value is $|\\det(J)| = \\lambda^{-n}$. The change of variables yields:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} |(D^{\\alpha} u)(\\lambda x)|^{p} \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} |(D^{\\alpha} u)(y)|^{p} \\, (\\lambda^{-n} dy) = \\lambda^{-n} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{n}} |(D^{\\alpha} u)(y)|^{p} \\, dy $$\nThe integral on the right is, by definition, $\\|D^{\\alpha} u\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p}$.\nCombining these results, we find the scaling for a single derivative term:\n$$ \\|D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} = \\lambda^{kp} \\cdot \\lambda^{-n} \\|D^{\\alpha} u\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} = \\lambda^{kp-n} \\|D^{\\alpha} u\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} $$\nFinally, we substitute this back into the definition of the homogeneous seminorm of $u_{\\lambda}$:\n$$ \\|u_{\\lambda}\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} = \\sum_{|\\alpha| = k} \\|D^{\\alpha} u_{\\lambda}\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} = \\sum_{|\\alpha| = k} \\lambda^{kp-n} \\|D^{\\alpha} u\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} $$\nThe scaling factor $\\lambda^{kp-n}$ is constant with respect to the summation index $\\alpha$, so we can factor it out:\n$$ \\|u_{\\lambda}\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} = \\lambda^{kp-n} \\left( \\sum_{|\\alpha| = k} \\|D^{\\alpha} u\\|_{L^{p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} \\right) $$\nThe term in the parentheses is precisely the definition of $\\|u\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p}$. Thus,\n$$ \\|u_{\\lambda}\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} = \\lambda^{kp-n} \\|u\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} $$\nTo obtain the seminorm itself, we take the $p$-th root of both sides. Since norms are non-negative, this is a well-defined operation:\n$$ \\|u_{\\lambda}\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})} = \\left( \\lambda^{kp-n} \\|u\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}^{p} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{p}} = (\\lambda^{kp-n})^{\\frac{1}{p}} \\|u\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})} $$\n$$ \\|u_{\\lambda}\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})} = \\lambda^{\\frac{kp-n}{p}} \\|u\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})} = \\lambda^{k - \\frac{n}{p}} \\|u\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})} $$\nBy comparing this result to the requested form $\\|u_{\\lambda}\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})} = S(\\lambda) \\, \\|u\\|_{\\dot{W}^{k,p}(\\mathbb{R}^{n})}$, we can identify the multiplicative factor $S(\\lambda)$.\n$$ S(\\lambda) = \\lambda^{k - \\frac{n}{p}} $$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the scaling factor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lambda^{k - \\frac{n}{p}}}$$", "id": "3033575"}, {"introduction": "A powerful consequence of Sobolev theory is the ability to deduce the regularity of a function, such as boundedness, from the integrability of its derivatives.
