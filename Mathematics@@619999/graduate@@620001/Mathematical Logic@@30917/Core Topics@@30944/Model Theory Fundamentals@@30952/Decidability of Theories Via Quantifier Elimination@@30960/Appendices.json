The theory of Dense Linear Orders without Endpoints ($T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$) is a classical example of a theory that admits quantifier elimination. All terms are formally defined, the axioms are standard, and the tasks are procedurally clear and unambiguous. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded in mathematical logic, and well-posed. There are no contradictions, missing information, or subjective elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Quantifier-Free Formula**\n\nThe first task is to find a quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x,z)$ that is equivalent to $\\varphi(x,z) \\equiv \\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)$ in the theory $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$. This equivalence means that for any model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ and any assignment of elements from the domain of $\\mathcal{M}$ to $x$ and $z$, the formulas $\\varphi(x,z)$ and $\\psi(x,z)$ have the same truth value. We demonstrate the equivalence $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}} \\models (\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)) \\leftrightarrow (xz)$.\n\n$1$. Proof of $(\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)) \\rightarrow (xz)$:\nAssume that for a given assignment of $x$ and $z$, the formula $\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)$ is true. This means there exists an element, let's call it $y_0$, such that $x  y_0$ and $y_0  z$. The theory $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ includes the axiom of transitivity for a strict linear order: $\\forall x,y,z\\,((xy\\wedge yz)\\rightarrow xz)$. Applying this axiom with $y_0$ in place of $y$, from the premise $(x  y_0 \\wedge y_0  z)$, we can deduce the conclusion $xz$. Thus, this implication holds in any model of $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$.\n\n$2$. Proof of $(xz) \\rightarrow (\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz))$:\nAssume that for a given assignment of $x$ and $z$, the formula $xz$ is true. The theory $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ includes the density axiom: $\\forall x,z\\,(xz\\rightarrow \\exists y\\,(xy\\wedge yz))$. This axiom directly states that if $xz$ holds, then $\\exists y\\,(xy\\wedge yz)$ must also hold.\n\nSince both implications are provable from the axioms of $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$, the formula $\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)$ is logically equivalent to $xz$ within this theory. The formula $xz$ is quantifier-free and depends only on the free variables $x$ and $z$.\nTherefore, the equivalent quantifier-free formula is:\n$$ \\psi(x,z) \\equiv xz $$\n\n**Justification regarding Quantifier Elimination and Decidability**\n\nThe theory $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ admits quantifier elimination. This means that for any formula $\\phi$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{\\}$, there is an equivalent quantifier-free formula $\\psi$. The derivation above is a concrete instance of this principle. We started with a formula $\\varphi(x,z)$ containing a quantifier and, by using the axioms of the theory, produced an equivalent formula $\\psi(x,z)$ that is free of quantifiers.\n\nThis property is fundamental to proving that $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ is a decidable theory. A theory is decidable if there exists an algorithm that can determine, for any given sentence $\\sigma$ (a formula with no free variables), whether $\\sigma$ is a theorem of the theory ($T_{\\mathrm{DLO}} \\models \\sigma$). The existence of a constructive procedure for quantifier elimination provides such an algorithm.\nFor any sentence $\\sigma$, we can mechanically apply the quantifier elimination algorithm to produce an equivalent quantifier-free sentence $\\sigma'$. Since $\\sigma'$ has no free variables and no quantifiers, and the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{\\}$ has no constants, $\\sigma'$ must be a universally valid statement (a tautology, $\\top$) or a contradiction ($\\bot$). Its truth value can be determined by simple inspection. Since $\\sigma$ is equivalent to $\\sigma'$, this determines the truth value of $\\sigma$ within the theory. This algorithmic process for determining the truth of any sentence makes the theory decidable.\n\n**Computation of the Gödel Number**\n\nThe final task is to compute the Gödel number of the resulting quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x,z)$, which is $xz$. The formula is viewed as a sequence of symbols $s_0s_1s_2$.\n\nThe sequence of symbols is $(x, , z)$. The length of the sequence is $n=3$.\nFrom the provided table, we extract the codes for these symbols:\n- $\\mathrm{code}(s_0) = \\mathrm{code}(x) = 11$\n- $\\mathrm{code}(s_1) = \\mathrm{code}() = 7$\n- $\\mathrm{code}(s_2) = \\mathrm{code}(z) = 13$\n\nThe Gödel number is defined by the product $G(s_{0}s_{1}\\cdots s_{n-1}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}^{\\,\\mathrm{code}(s_{i-1})}$, where $p_i$ is the $i$-th prime number. We need the first $3$ prime numbers:\n- $p_1 = 2$\n- $p_2 = 3$\n- $p_3 = 5$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $G(\\psi) = G(xz)$:\n$$ G(xz) = p_1^{\\mathrm{code}(x)} \\times p_2^{\\mathrm{code}()} \\times p_3^{\\mathrm{code}(z)} $$\n$$ G(xz) = 2^{11} \\times 3^7 \\times 5^{13} $$\nThis expression is the exact, closed-form required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2^{11} \\times 3^{7} \\times 5^{13}}$$", "id": "2971288"}, {"introduction": "We now advance to the powerful theory of Real Closed Fields (RCF), a cornerstone of model theory with deep connections to real algebraic geometry.

The Tarski-Seidenberg theorem guarantees that RCF admits quantifier elimination, which ensures the existence of such a formula. We shall demonstrate that the formula $\\psi(x) \\equiv (0 \\leq x)$ is logically equivalent to $\\varphi(x)$ in RCF.\n\nTo establish this equivalence, we must prove that the theory of RCF entails the universal closure of the corresponding biconditional statement, which is formally written as $T_{RCF} \\models \\forall x (\\varphi(x) \\leftrightarrow \\psi(x))$. This requires proving the equivalence by demonstrating two separate implications.\n\n1. Proof of $T_{RCF} \\models \\forall x ((\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x)) \\rightarrow (0 \\leq x))$:\nLet $K$ be any model of RCF, which is by definition an ordered field. Let $a$ be an element in the domain of $K$ such that the formula $\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=a)$ is satisfied in $K$. By the semantics of first-order logic, this means there exists an element $b \\in K$ such that the equality $b^{2}=a$ holds.

From the equality $b^{2}=a$, it directly follows that $a \\geq 0$. In the language $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{or}}$, this is written as $0 \\leq a$. Since this argument holds for any arbitrary element $a$ in any model $K$ of RCF, the implication $(\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x)) \\rightarrow (0 \\leq x)$ is a theorem of RCF.\n\n2. Proof of $T_{RCF} \\models \\forall x ((0 \\leq x) \\rightarrow (\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x)))$:\nLet $K$ again be any model of RCF. Let $a$ be an element in the domain of $K$ such that the condition $0 \\leq a$ is satisfied. The problem statement provides as Fact (ii) that a defining property of a real closed field is that every non-negative element is a square. Since $a$ is a non-negative element of $K$, there must exist some element $b \\in K$ such that $b^{2} = a$. This means that the formula $\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=a)$ is satisfied in $K$. Since this argument holds for any arbitrary non-negative element $a$ in any model $K$ of RCF, the implication $(0 \\leq x) \\rightarrow (\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x))$ is also a theorem of RCF.\n\nBy combining both proven implications, we have rigorously established that the formula $\\varphi(x) \\equiv \\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x)$ is equivalent in RCF to the quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x) \\equiv (0 \\leq x)$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an analysis in the standard model of RCF, which is the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ equipped with its usual addition, multiplication, and ordering. The definable set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers $x$ that satisfy the formula $\\varphi(x)$. Using the equivalence we just proved, we can characterize this set:\n$$S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\mathbb{R} \\models \\varphi(x) \\} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\mathbb{R} \\models (0 \\leq x) \\} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x \\geq 0 \\}$$\nTherefore, the set $S$ is the interval of non-negative real numbers, $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nWe are asked to determine the number of connected components of the set $S \\cap [-1,1]$. We first compute this intersection explicitly:\n$$S \\cap [-1,1] = [0, \\infty) \\cap [-1,1] = [0,1]$$\nThe resulting set is the closed and bounded interval $[0,1]$.\n\nIn the standard Euclidean topology on $\\mathbb{R}$, a fundamental theorem of point-set topology states that a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if it is an interval.

Provide your final answer as the explicit expanded analytic expression for $P(s,t)$. No rounding is needed and no units are involved.", "solution": "The user has provided a valid problem statement. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks to find a quantifier-free formula equivalent to $\\varphi(s,t) := \\exists x\\;(x^2 + s x + t \\le 0)$ within the theory of real closed fields (RCFs) and then to identify a specific polynomial related to the solution set. The prescribed method involves analyzing the polynomial's derivative and extremal behavior.\n\nLet the polynomial in question be $f(x, s, t) = x^2 + s x + t$. For fixed parameters $s$ and $t$ from a real closed field $R$ (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}$), this is a function of a single variable $x$. The formula $\\varphi(s,t)$ asserts that there exists an element $x \\in R$ for which the value of this polynomial is non-positive.\n\nThe polynomial $f(x, s, t)$ describes a parabola in the variable $x$. Since the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is $1$, which is positive, the parabola opens upwards. This implies that if the function takes on any non-positive value, its global minimum value must be non-positive. Conversely, if the global minimum is non-positive, then there clearly exists an $x$ for which $f(x, s, t) \\le 0$. Therefore, the statement $\\exists x (f(x, s, t) \\le 0)$ is logically equivalent to the statement that the minimum value of $f(x, s, t)$ with respect to $x$ is less than or equal to $0$.\n\nThe method specified requires us to use the derivative to find this minimum. The principles of differential calculus (like finding extrema by setting the derivative to zero) are consequences of the axioms of RCFs and apply here. We compute the derivative of $f(x, s, t)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2 + s x + t) = 2x + s\n$$\nThe sign of the derivative determines the monotonicity of the function. The derivative is zero at the critical point where $2x + s = 0$, which occurs at $x = -\\frac{s}{2}$.\n- For $x  -\\frac{s}{2}$, the derivative $2x + s$ is negative, so $f(x, s, t)$ is strictly decreasing.\n- For $x  -\\frac{s}{2}$, the derivative $2x + s$ is positive, so $f(x, s, t)$ is strictly increasing.\n\nThis analysis confirms that the function $f(x, s, t)$ achieves a global minimum at the critical point $x = -\\frac{s}{2}$. To find this minimum value, we substitute $x = -\\frac{s}{2}$ back into the polynomial:\n$$\nf\\left(-\\frac{s}{2}, s, t\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 + s\\left(-\\frac{s}{2}\\right) + t = \\frac{s^2}{4} - \\frac{s^2}{2} + t = t - \\frac{s^2}{4}\n$$\nAs established, the existence of an $x$ satisfying $f(x, s, t) \\le 0$ is equivalent to this minimum value being less than or equal to $0$. Thus, we can replace the original formula involving a quantifier with an equivalent quantifier-free formula involving only the parameters $s$ and $t$:\n$$\nt - \\frac{s^2}{4} \\le 0\n$$\nThis inequality can be rewritten by multiplying by $4$ (which is positive and thus preserves the inequality) and rearranging the terms:\n$$\n4t \\le s^2\n$$\n$$\ns^2 - 4t \\ge 0\n$$\nThis is the explicit quantifier-free formula equivalent to $\\varphi(s,t)$. This inequality defines a semialgebraic set in the $(s,t)$-plane, specifically the set of points $(s,t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $s^2 - 4t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the irreducible polynomial $P(s,t)$ whose zero set is the topological boundary of this region. The set is defined by the inequality $g(s,t) \\ge 0$, where $g(s,t) = s^2 - 4t$. Since $g(s,t)$ is a continuous function, the boundary of the set $\\{(s,t) \\mid g(s,t) \\ge 0\\}$ is contained in the zero set $\\{(s,t) \\mid g(s,t) = 0\\}$. Furthermore, for any point on the curve $s^2-4t=0$, any open neighborhood around it will contain points where $s^2-4t  0$ and points where $s^2-4t  0$. Therefore, the boundary is precisely the set of points where $s^2 - 4t = 0$.\n\nThe polynomial whose zero set defines this boundary is $P(s,t) = s^2 - 4t$ (or any non-zero constant multiple of it). We must verify that this polynomial is irreducible in the ring $\\mathbb{R}[s,t]$. We can view $P(s,t) = s^2 - 4t$ as a polynomial in the variable $t$ with coefficients from the ring $\\mathbb{R}[s]$. In this view, it is a first-degree polynomial: $(-4)t + s^2$. A polynomial of degree $1$ is irreducible over a unique factorization domain (like $\\mathbb{R}[s]$) if and only if it is primitive, i.e., its coefficients are coprime. The coefficients are $-4$ and $s^2$. The greatest common divisor of $-4$ and $s^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}[s]$ is a constant (e.g., $1$), which is a unit in $\\mathbb{R}[s]$. Thus, the polynomial is primitive. Since it is a primitive polynomial of degree $1$ in $t$, it is irreducible in $(\\mathbb{R}[s])[t]$, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}[s,t]$.\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit expanded analytic expression for $P(s,t)$.
