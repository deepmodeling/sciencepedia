It is scientifically grounded in the fields of algebraic geometry and mathematical logic, well-posed, and objective. It contains a complete and consistent set of givens, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is set over an arbitrary algebraically closed field $K$. We are given the affine variety $V \\subset \\mathbb{A}^{2}_{K}$ defined by the equation $x y - 1 = 0$, and the projection morphism $\\pi: \\mathbb{A}^{2}_{K} \\to \\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$ defined by $\\pi(x,y) = x$.\n\nFirst, we address step 1: Justifying that the image $\\pi(V)$ is constructible but not Zariski-closed in $\\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$.\nThe image $\\pi(V)$ is the set of all first coordinates of points in $V$. A point $a \\in \\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$ is in $\\pi(V)$ if and only if there exists a $b \\in K$ such that $(a,b) \\in V$. The condition for a point to be in $V$ is that its coordinates satisfy the defining equation. Thus, $a \\in \\pi(V)$ if and only if there exists a $b \\in K$ such that $a b - 1 = 0$.\nWe analyze this condition for an arbitrary $a \\in K$.\nIf $a \\neq 0$, the equation $a b - 1 = 0$ is a linear equation in $b$ with a unique solution $b = 1/a$. Since $a \\in K$ and $a \\neq 0$, and $K$ is a field, $1/a$ is a well-defined element of $K$. Thus, for any $a \\neq 0$, the point $(a, 1/a)$ is in $V$, and so $a \\in \\pi(V)$.\nIf $a = 0$, the equation becomes $0 \\cdot b - 1 = 0$, which simplifies to $-1 = 0$. Since $K$ is a field, its characteristic is not $1$, so $-1 \\neq 0$. This is a contradiction, and thus no such $b$ exists in $K$. Therefore, $0 \\notin \\pi(V)$.\nCombining these two cases, the image is precisely the set of all non-zero elements of $K$:\n$$ \\pi(V) = \\{a \\in K \\mid a \\neq 0\\} = \\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K} \\setminus \\{0\\} $$\nA set is constructible if it is a finite union of locally closed sets. A set is locally closed if it is the intersection of a Zariski-open set and a Zariski-closed set. The set $\\pi(V) = \\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is an open set in the Zariski topology on $\\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$, because its complement, the set $\\{0\\}$, is the zero set of the polynomial $x$, i.e., $V(x)$, which is by definition a Zariski-closed set. Any open set $U$ is constructible, as it can be written as $U \\cap \\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$, the intersection of an open set ($U$) and a closed set (the whole space $\\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$). Thus, $\\pi(V)$ is constructible.\nAlternatively, Chevalley's theorem states that the image of a constructible set under a morphism of algebraic varieties is constructible. The variety $V$ is a closed set in $\\mathbb{A}^{2}_{K}$ and is therefore constructible. The projection $\\pi$ is a regular map, which is a morphism of affine varieties. Therefore, its image $\\pi(V)$ must be constructible.\nTo show that $\\pi(V)$ is not Zariski-closed, we recall that the proper Zariski-closed subsets of $\\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$ are precisely the finite sets of points. Since the field $K$ is algebraically closed, it is infinite. The set $\\pi(V) = \\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K} \\setminus \\{0\\}$ is therefore an infinite set. It is also a proper subset of $\\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$ because it excludes the point $0$. Since it is an infinite proper subset, it cannot be a Zariski-closed subset of $\\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$.\n\nSecond, we address step 2: Writing a first-order formula for $\\pi(V)$ and invoking quantifier elimination.\nThe set $\\pi(V)$ is defined as the set of elements $x \\in K$ for which there exists a corresponding $y \\in K$ such that the point $(x,y)$ lies on the variety $V$. This can be directly translated into a first-order formula in the language of rings $\\{+, \\cdot, 0, 1\\}$. The condition $(x,y) \\in V$ is equivalent to the polynomial equation $x \\cdot y - 1 = 0$. The existence of such a $y$ for a given $x$ is expressed with an existential quantifier. Therefore, the formula $\\varphi(x)$ that defines the set $\\pi(V)$ in $K$ is:\n$$ \\varphi(x) \\equiv \\exists y (x \\cdot y - 1 = 0) $$\nThe theory of algebraically closed fields (ACF) is a celebrated example of a theory that admits quantifier elimination. This fundamental result from model theory asserts that for any first-order formula in the language of rings, there exists an equivalent quantifier-free formula. Equivalence here means that the formulas define the same set of tuples in any algebraically closed field. A quantifier-free formula is a Boolean combination (using connectives $\\land, \\lor, \\neg$) of atomic formulas, which are polynomial equations of the form $p(z_1, \\dots, z_n) = 0$. Thus, by the theorem of quantifier elimination for ACF, the formula $\\varphi(x)$ must be equivalent to a quantifier-free formula in the free variable $x$.\n\nThird, we address step 3: Determining the explicit quantifier-free formula and the complement.\nWe perform quantifier elimination on $\\varphi(x) \\equiv \\exists y (x \\cdot y - 1 = 0)$. The equation $x \\cdot y - 1 = 0$ can be viewed as an equation for $y$, with $x$ as a parameter. It is a polynomial in $y$, namely $p(y) = xy - 1$.\nThe existence of a root for a polynomial depends on its degree.\nCase 1: If $x \\neq 0$, the polynomial $p(y)$ is of degree $1$ in $y$. Any degree $1$ polynomial has a unique root in the field $K$.\nCase 2: If $x = 0$, the polynomial becomes $p(y) = -1$, which is a constant non-zero polynomial of degree $0$. It has no roots.\nThus, a solution $y$ exists if and only if $x \\neq 0$.\nThe condition $x \\neq 0$ can be written in the language of rings as the negation of the atomic formula $x = 0$. So, the equivalent quantifier-free formula is:\n$$ \\neg(x = 0) $$\nThis formula defines the set $\\{ a \\in K \\mid a \\neq 0 \\}$, which is indeed $\\pi(V)$.\nThe Zariski-closed complement of $\\pi(V)$ is the set $C = \\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K} \\setminus \\pi(V)$.\n$$ C = \\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K} \\setminus (\\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K} \\setminus \\{0\\}) = \\{0\\} $$\nThis set $C$ is described by the negation of the formula for $\\pi(V)$, which is $\\neg(\\neg(x=0))$, equivalent to the atomic formula $x=0$. Thus, $C$ is the set of points in $\\mathbb{A}^{1}_{K}$ where $x=0$. This is the variety corresponding to the principal ideal generated by the polynomial $x$, denoted $V(x)$.\n\nFourth, we address step 4: Computing the minimal monic polynomial $p(x)$ for the complement $C$.\nThe complement is the set $C = \\{0\\}$. We seek the unique monic polynomial $p(x) \\in K[x]$ of least positive degree such that the set of its roots, $V(p)$, is equal to $C$. So we require $V(p(x)) = \\{0\\}$.\nThis means that $p(0) = 0$, so $x$ must be a factor of $p(x)$. Since the field $K$ is algebraically closed, any polynomial $p(x)$ with only the root $0$ must be of the form $c \\cdot x^n$ for some non-zero constant $c \\in K$ and some integer $n \\ge 1$.\nThe degree of this polynomial is $n$. The problem asks for the polynomial of least positive degree. The least positive integer value for $n$ is $1$. So the polynomial must be of the form $c \\cdot x^1 = c x$.\nFurthermore, the problem requires $p(x)$ to be monic. A polynomial is monic if its leading coefficient is $1$. The leading coefficient of $c x$ is $c$. Therefore, we must have $c=1$.\nThe unique monic polynomial of least positive degree whose zero set is $\\{0\\}$ is thus $p(x) = x$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x}\n$$", "id": "2980699"}, {"introduction": "Having established the geometric intuition, we now turn to the algebraic machinery that makes quantifier elimination constructive.

We are asked to compute the first elimination ideal $I_{1} = I \\cap K[x]$. This ideal consists of all polynomials in $I$ that depend solely on the variable $x$.

Since $\\text{Res}_{y}(f_{1}, f_{2}) = 1 - x^{3}$ is a polynomial in $x$ alone, it must be an element of the elimination ideal $I_{1} = I \\cap K[x]$.\n\nThe Elimination Theorem connects the resultant to the elimination ideal. As the leading coefficient of $f_{1}$ with respect to $y$ is $1$, which is a non-zero constant, the elimination ideal $I_{1}$ is precisely the principal ideal generated by the resultant. Since $K[x]$ is a principal ideal domain (PID), $I_{1}$ is generated by a single polynomial. We have found this generator to be $1-x^3$. As the generator of a principal ideal is unique up to multiplication by a non-zero constant from the field $K$, we can choose the generator to be $p(x) = x^{3}-1$, which is simply $-1 \\cdot (1-x^3)$.\nTherefore, the first elimination ideal is $I_{1} = \\langle x^{3}-1 \\rangle$.\n\nNext, we interpret this result in the context of quantifier elimination for algebraically closed fields. The affine variety $V(I)$ is the set of common zeros of the polynomials in $I$:\n$$\nV(I) = \\{ (a,b) \\in K^{2} \\mid b^{2}-a=0 \\text{ and } ab-1=0 \\}\n$$\nThe projection of this variety onto the $x$-coordinate, $\\pi_{x}(V(I))$, is the set of first coordinates of the points in $V(I)$:\n$$\n\\pi_{x}(V(I)) = \\{ a \\in K \\mid \\exists b \\in K \\text{ such that } (a,b) \\in V(I) \\}\n$$\nSubstituting the defining equations of $V(I)$, we have:\n$$\n\\pi_{x}(V(I)) = \\{ a \\in K \\mid \\exists b \\in K, (b^{2}=a \\wedge ab=1) \\}\n$$\nThis set is precisely the set of values $a \\in K$ for which the first-order formula in the language of rings, $\\phi(x) := \\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x \\wedge xy=1)$, is true.\n\nThe theory of algebraically closed fields (ACF) admits quantifier elimination. This means that any formula, such as $\\phi(x)$, is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula, $\\psi(x)$, in the same free variables. For a formula with one free variable $x$, $\\psi(x)$ is a Boolean combination of atomic formulas of the form $P(x)=0$, where $P \\in K[x]$. The set of points satisfying such a formula is a constructible set.\n\nThe link between the algebraic computation and the logical model theory is given by the Fundamental Theorem of Elimination Theory, which states that the Zariski closure of the projection of an affine variety is itself an affine variety defined by the elimination ideal. In symbols:\n$$\n\\overline{\\pi_{x}(V(I))} = V(I_{1})\n$$\nWe computed $I_{1} = \\langle x^{3}-1 \\rangle$, so $V(I_{1}) = \\{ a \\in K \\mid a^{3}-1=0 \\}$. This gives the closure of the projection.\n\nTo find the projection set itself, we can solve the system of equations for $a$. An element $a \\in K$ belongs to $\\pi_{x}(V(I))$ if there exists a $b \\in K$ satisfying $b^{2}=a$ and $ab=1$.\nIf $a=0$, the first equation implies $b=0$, but then the second equation becomes $0=1$, which is a contradiction. Thus, $a \\neq 0$.\nSince $a \\neq 0$, the equation $ab=1$ has a unique solution for $b$, namely $b=a^{-1}$. Substituting this into the first equation yields:\n$$\n(a^{-1})^{2} = a \\implies \\frac{1}{a^{2}} = a \\implies 1 = a^{3}\n$$\nSo, an element $a \\in K$ is in the projection if and only if $a^{3}-1=0$. This means:\n$$\n\\pi_{x}(V(I)) = \\{ a \\in K \\mid a^{3}-1=0 \\} = V(\\langle x^{3}-1 \\rangle) = V(I_{1})\n$$\nIn this case, the projection $\\pi_{x}(V(I))$ is already a Zariski-closed set, so it equals its closure.\n\nThe quantifier elimination procedure therefore converts the existential formula $\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x \\wedge xy=1)$ into the equivalent quantifier-free formula $x^{3}-1=0$.
