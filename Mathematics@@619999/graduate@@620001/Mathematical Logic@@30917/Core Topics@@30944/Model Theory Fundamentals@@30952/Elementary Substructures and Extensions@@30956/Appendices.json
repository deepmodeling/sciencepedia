The problem specifically requests a case where $\\mathcal{Z} \\models \\varphi(i(a))$ but $\\mathcal{N} \\not\\models \\varphi(a)$. Since $i$ is the inclusion map, $i(a)=a$, so we seek $\\mathcal{Z} \\models \\varphi(a)$ and $\\mathcal{N} \\not\\models \\varphi(a)$.\n\nA key algebraic difference between the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}=\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$ and the set of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the existence of additive inverses for non-zero elements. Every element in $\\mathbb{Z}$ has an additive inverse, whereas in $\\mathbb{N}$, only $0$ has an additive inverse (which is itself). This property can be expressed in the language $L$.\n\nLet's define the $L$-formula $\\varphi(x)$ as:\n$$ \\varphi(x) := \\exists y \\, (x+y=0) $$\nThis formula expresses the property that \"an element $x$ has an additive inverse $y$\".\n\nLet's determine the quantifier rank of this formula. The subformula $x+y=0$ is an atomic formula, so its quantifier rank is $qr(x+y=0)=0$. The formula $\\varphi(x)$ is formed by applying one existential quantifier. Based on the provided definition, its quantifier rank is:\n$$ qr(\\varphi(x)) = qr(\\exists y \\, (x+y=0)) = qr(x+y=0) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 $$\n\nNow, let's choose a specific parameter $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and evaluate $\\varphi(a)$ in both structures. We must pick a non-zero element to see the difference. Let us choose $a=1$.\n\n1.  Evaluation in $\\mathcal{N}$: We check if $\\mathcal{N} \\models \\varphi(1)$, which is $\\mathcal{N} \\models \\exists y \\, (1+y=0)$. This statement is true if there exists an element $y$ in the domain of $\\mathcal{N}$ (which is $\\mathbb{N}$) such that $1+y=0$. In standard arithmetic, the only solution is $y=-1$. However, $-1 \\notin \\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, there is no such $y$ in $\\mathcal{N}$, and the statement is false. We conclude:\n    $$ \\mathcal{N} \\not\\models \\varphi(1) $$\n\n2.  Evaluation in $\\mathcal{Z}$: We check if $\\mathcal{Z} \\models \\varphi(1)$, which is $\\mathcal{Z} \\models \\exists y \\, (1+y=0)$. This statement is true if there exists an element $y$ in the domain of $\\mathcal{Z}$ (which is $\\mathbb{Z}$) such that $1+y=0$. The solution $y=-1$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, such a $y$ exists in $\\mathcal{Z}$. We conclude:\n    $$ \\mathcal{Z} \\models \\varphi(1) $$\n\nWe have successfully found a formula $\\varphi(x)$ with quantifier rank $1$ and a parameter $a=1 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\mathcal{Z} \\models \\varphi(a)$ and $\\mathcal{N} \\not\\models \\varphi(a)$. This explicitly shows that the embedding $i \\colon \\mathcal{N} \\hookrightarrow \\mathcal{Z}$ is not elementary.\n\nNext, we must determine the minimal quantifier rank $r$ for which such a witnessing formula exists. From the above, we know that $r \\le 1$. We now investigate if a formula with quantifier rank $0$ can act as a witness.\n\nA formula with quantifier rank $0$ is a quantifier-free formula. In the language $L$, any quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ is a Boolean combination (using $\\neg, \\wedge, \\vee$, etc.) of atomic formulas. Atomic formulas in $L$ are of the form $t_1(x) = t_2(x)$, where $t_1(x)$ and $t_2(x)$ are terms.\n\nA term in $L$ built with the variable $x$ and constants $0$ and $1$ using functions $+$ and $\\times$ is a polynomial in $x$ with integer coefficients. For example, the term $(x \\times x) + 1$ corresponds to the polynomial $x^2+1$. So, an atomic formula is an equation of the form $P(x) = Q(x)$, where $P$ and $Q$ are such polynomials.\n\nLet's analyze the truth of an atomic formula $\\alpha(x)$ of the form $t_1(x) = t_2(x)$ for a parameter $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ in both structures.\nThe interpretation of a term $t(x)$ in $\\mathcal{N}$ with $x$ assigned the value $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ results in a value $t^{\\mathcal{N}}(a) \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nThe interpretation of the same term in $\\mathcal{Z}$ with $x$ assigned the value $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ results in a value $t^{\\mathcal{Z}}(a) \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince addition and multiplication of natural numbers are the same whether viewed as operations in $\\mathbb{N}$ or in $\\mathbb{Z}$, for any $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we have $t^{\\mathcal{N}}(a) = t^{\\mathcal{Z}}(a)$.\n\nTherefore, for any atomic formula $t_1(x) = t_2(x)$ and any parameter $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{N} \\models t_1(a) = t_2(a) \\iff t_1^{\\mathcal{N}}(a) = t_2^{\\mathcal{N}}(a) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{Z} \\models t_1(a) = t_2(a) \\iff t_1^{\\mathcal{Z}}(a) = t_2^{\\mathcal{Z}}(a) $$\nSince $t_1^{\\mathcal{N}}(a) = t_1^{\\mathcal{Z}}(a)$ and $t_2^{\\mathcal{N}}(a) = t_2^{\\mathcal{Z}}(a)$, it follows that:\n$$ \\mathcal{N} \\models t_1(a) = t_2(a) \\iff \\mathcal{Z} \\models t_1(a) = t_2(a) $$\nThis shows that any atomic formula has the same truth value in $\\mathcal{N}$ and $\\mathcal{Z}$ for any parameter from $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe truth value of a quantifier-free formula is determined by the truth values of its constituent atomic formulas and the rules for the logical connectives. Since the atomic formulas cannot distinguish between the structures for parameters in $\\mathbb{N}$, and the logical connectives are interpreted identically, no Boolean combination of these atomic formulas can distinguish them either. By structural induction, for any quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x)$ and any $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $\\mathcal{N} \\models \\psi(a) \\iff \\mathcal{Z} \\models \\psi(a)$.\n\nThis proves that no formula of quantifier rank $0$ can witness the non-elementary nature of the embedding. Thus, the minimal quantifier rank $r$ must be strictly greater than $0$. As we are dealing with integer ranks, $r \\ge 1$.\n\nWe have established two facts:\n1. The minimal rank $r$ must satisfy $r \\ge 1$.\n2. We have found an explicit witnessing formula, $\\varphi(x) = \\exists y \\, (x+y=0)$, with quantifier rank $1$. This implies $r \\le 1$.\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we conclude that the minimal quantifier rank is $r=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2972428"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how basic algebraic properties can break elementarity, we now turn to a richer context: the ordered fields of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ and real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.

The core of the problem is to demonstrate that $\\mathcal{Q}$ is a substructure of $\\mathcal{R}$ but not an elementary one, by constructing a specific first-order formula.\n\nFirst, the givens are validated. The problem is set in the standard mathematical framework of model theory and real analysis. The language $L_{\\mathrm{or}}=\\{0,1,+,\\cdot,\\leq\\}$, the structures $\\mathcal{Q}=(\\mathbb{Q},0,1,+,\\cdot,\\leq)$ and $\\mathcal{R}=(\\mathbb{R},0,1,+,\\cdot,\\leq)$, and the foundational base (definitions, properties of fields, completeness of $\\mathbb{R}$, and unique factorization) are all well-defined, consistent, and scientifically grounded. The tasks are unambiguous and lead to a verifiable conclusion. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**1. Justification that $\\mathcal{Q}$ is an $L_{\\mathrm{or}}$-substructure of $\\mathcal{R}$**\n\nFor $\\mathcal{Q}$ to be an $L_{\\mathrm{or}}$-substructure of $\\mathcal{R}$, several conditions must be met:\n- The universe of $\\mathcal{Q}$, which is the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, must be a subset of the universe of $\\mathcal{R}$, which is the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. This is true, as $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$.\n- For each constant symbol in $L_{\\mathrm{or}}$, its interpretation in $\\mathcal{Q}$ must be the same as in $\\mathcal{R}$. The constant symbols are $0$ and $1$. In both structures, these symbols are interpreted as the familiar additive and multiplicative identities, respectively. Thus, $0^{\\mathcal{Q}} = 0^{\\mathcal{R}} = 0$ and $1^{\\mathcal{Q}} = 1^{\\mathcal{R}} = 1$.\n- For each function symbol in $L_{\\mathrm{or}}$, its interpretation in $\\mathcal{Q}$ must be the restriction of its interpretation in $\\mathcal{R}$ to the domain of $\\mathcal{Q}$. The function symbols are $+$ (addition) and $\\cdot$ (multiplication). For any two rational numbers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the sum $a+b$ and product $a \\cdot b$ are the same operations with the same results whether performed in $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{R}$. That is, $+^{\\mathcal{Q}} = +^{\\mathcal{R}}|_{\\mathbb{Q}\\times\\mathbb{Q}}$ and $\\cdot^{\\mathcal{Q}} = \\cdot^{\\mathcal{R}}|_{\\mathbb{Q}\\times\\mathbb{Q}}$.\n- For each relation symbol in $L_{\\mathrm{or}}$, its interpretation in $\\mathcal{Q}$ must be the restriction of its interpretation in $\\mathcal{R}$. The relation symbol is $\\leq$ (order). For any two rational numbers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, the relation $a \\leq b$ holds in $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it holds in $\\mathbb{R}$. That is, $\\leq^{\\mathcal{Q}} = {\\leq^{\\mathcal{R}}}\\cap(\\mathbb{Q}\\times\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied, $\\mathcal{Q}$ is an $L_{\\mathrm{or}}$-substructure of $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\n**2. Construction of the Existential Formula**\n\nTo show that $\\mathcal{Q}$ is not an elementary substructure of $\\mathcal{R}$, we must find a formula $\\varphi(\\bar{a})$ with parameters $\\bar{a}$ from $\\mathcal{Q}$ such that $\\mathcal{Q}\\models\\varphi(\\bar{a})$ and $\\mathcal{R}\\not\\models\\varphi(\\bar{a})$, or vice-versa. The problem asks for an existential sentence $\\exists x\\,\\psi(x)$ that is true in $\\mathcal{R}$ but false in $\\mathcal{Q}$.\n\nThe key difference between $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ given in the foundational base is the least upper bound property of $\\mathbb{R}$. A classic consequence of this property is the existence of roots for positive numbers. We can use this to construct the formula. Let's consider the existence of a positive square root of $2$.\n\nThe number $2$ can be represented in the language $L_{\\mathrm{or}}$ by the term $1+1$. A number $x$ being the positive square root of $2$ can be expressed by the formula $(x \\cdot x = 1+1) \\land (x > 0)$. The strict inequality $x>0$ can be written using the available symbols as $0 \\leq x \\land \\neg(0=x)$.\n\nLet $\\psi(x)$ be the quantifier-free formula $(x \\cdot x = 1+1) \\land (0 \\leq x \\land \\neg(0=x))$.\nThe required existential formula is $\\exists x\\,\\psi(x)$.\n\n**3. Proof of Truth Conditions**\n\nWe will now prove that this formula distinguishes $\\mathcal{R}$ from $\\mathcal{Q}$.\n\n- **Truth in $\\mathcal{R}$**: We must show that $\\mathcal{R} \\models \\exists x\\,((x \\cdot x = 1+1) \\land (0 \\leq x \\land \\neg(0=x)))$.\nThis is equivalent to asserting the existence of a positive real number whose square is $2$. The existence of such a number, denoted $\\sqrt{2}$, is a fundamental consequence of the completeness of the real numbers (the least upper bound property).\nTo be explicit, consider the set $S = \\{y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid y \\cdot y < 2\\}$. This set is non-empty (e.g., $1 \\in S$) and bounded above (e.g., by $2$). By the least upper bound property, $S$ has a least upper bound $s = \\sup S$ in $\\mathbb{R}$. One can prove by trichotomy that $s \\cdot s$ cannot be less than $2$ or greater than $2$. If $s \\cdot s < 2$, one could find a real number $s' > s$ with $(s')^2 < 2$, contradicting that $s$ is an upper bound. If $s \\cdot s > 2$, one could find an upper bound $s'' < s$, contradicting that $s$ is the least upper bound. Thus, it must be that $s \\cdot s = 2$. Since $1 \\in S$, $s \\geq 1$, which implies $s>0$. So, $x=s=\\sqrt{2}$ is a witness in $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{R} \\models \\exists x\\,\\psi(x)$.\n\n- **Falsity in $\\mathcal{Q}$**: We must show that $\\mathcal{Q} \\not\\models \\exists x\\,((x \\cdot x = 1+1) \\land (0 \\leq x \\land \\neg(0=x)))$.\nThis is equivalent to asserting that there is no positive rational number whose square is $2$. This is the well-known fact that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. The proof relies on the unique factorization of integers, which is part of the allowed foundational base.\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a rational number $x = p/q$ where $p, q$ are integers, $q \\neq 0$, and $\\gcd(p,q)=1$, such that $x^2 = 2$. Then $(p/q)^2=2$, which implies $p^2 = 2q^2$. This shows that $p^2$ is an even integer. The prime factorization of $p^2$ contains the prime $2$. Since the exponents in the prime factorization of a square must be even, the exponent of $2$ in the factorization of $p^2$ is even. However, the exponent of $2$ in the factorization of $2q^2$ is $1 + (\\text{exponent of } 2 \\text{ in } q^2)$, which is an odd number. This contradicts the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (unique prime factorization). A more elementary argument follows: since $p^2$ is even, $p$ must be even. Let $p=2k$ for some integer $k$. Substituting this gives $(2k)^2=2q^2$, or $4k^2=2q^2$, which simplifies to $2k^2=q^2$. This implies $q^2$ is even, so $q$ must also be even. This means both $p$ and $q$ are divisible by $2$, which contradicts the assumption that $\\gcd(p,q)=1$.\nTherefore, no such rational number $x$ exists. Consequently, $\\mathcal{Q} \\not\\models \\exists x\\,\\psi(x)$.\n\n**4. Determination of the Least Witness**\n\nThe final task is to find the least real number that is a witness to the formula $\\exists x\\,\\psi(x)$ in $\\mathcal{R}$. The set of witnesses is $W = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\mathcal{R} \\models \\psi(x)\\}$.\nThis is the set $W = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid (x \\cdot x = 2) \\land (x > 0)\\}$.\nThe equation $x^2 = 2$ has exactly two solutions in $\\mathbb{R}$: $x=\\sqrt{2}$ and $x=-\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe condition $x > 0$ eliminates the negative solution.\nThus, the set of witnesses is the singleton set $W = \\{\\sqrt{2}\\}$.\nA singleton set has a unique element, which is vacuously the least element.\nThe least real witness is therefore $\\sqrt{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}$$", "id": "2972446"}, {"introduction": "The previous examples demonstrated how to prove a substructure is *not* elementary.

First, we must validate the problem statement and then proceed with a rigorous, step-by-step derivation. The problem is well-posed and founded on standard principles of model theory and field theory.\n\nThe number of elements $n$ in the set $S$ is given by the expression:\n$$\nn = \\binom{8}{3} - \\binom{5}{2}\n$$\nWe calculate the binomial coefficients:\n$$\n\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8!}{3!5!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56\n$$\n$$\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n$$\nSubstituting these values, we find $n$:\n$$\nn = 56 - 10 = 46\n$$\nSo, the set $S$ consists of $46$ elements, $S = \\{a_{1}, \\dots, a_{46}\\}$, which are algebraically independent over the field $K$.\n\nThe first task is to justify that $L$ is an elementary extension of $K$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Sk}}$ be the language of rings $\\mathcal{L}$ augmented with all Skolem function symbols for the theory $\\mathrm{ACF}_{0}$. Let $\\mathfrak{C}_{\\text{Sk}}$ be the expansion of the monster model $\\mathfrak{C}$ to an $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Sk}}$-structure.\nThe structure $M$ is defined as the Skolem hull of the set $K \\cup S$ in $\\mathfrak{C}_{\\text{Sk}}$. A fundamental property of Skolemization is that any Skolem hull is an elementary substructure of the ambient model. Therefore, $M$ is an elementary substructure of $\\mathfrak{C}_{\\text{Sk}}$, denoted $M \\preceq \\mathfrak{C}_{\\text{Sk}}$.\nThis implies that for any $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Sk}}$-formula $\\phi(x_1, \\dots, x_k)$ and any choice of parameters $c_1, \\dots, c_k$ from the universe of $M$, the formula holds in $M$ if and only if it holds in $\\mathfrak{C}_{\\text{Sk}}$.\nThe structure $L$ is the reduct of $M$ to the original language $\\mathcal{L}$. Similarly, $\\mathfrak{C}$ is the reduct of $\\mathfrak{C}_{\\text{Sk}}$. Since the elementary substructure relationship $M \\preceq \\mathfrak{C}_{\\text{Sk}}$ holds for all formulas in $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{Sk}}$, it must also hold for the subset of formulas that are in $\\mathcal{L}$. Thus, $L$ is an elementary substructure of $\\mathfrak{C}$, i.e., $L \\preceq \\mathfrak{C}$.\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between $K$ and $\\mathfrak{C}$. The field $K$ is algebraically closed and of characteristic $0$, so $K$ is a model of the theory $\\mathrm{ACF}_{0}$. Since $\\mathrm{ACF}_{0}$ is a complete theory, any of its models is an elementary substructure of a sufficiently saturated monster model. As $K$ is a subfield of $\\mathfrak{C}$, we have $K \\preceq \\mathfrak{C}$.\n\nBy construction of the Skolem hull, the set $K \\cup S$ is a subset of the universe of $M$, and therefore $K$ is a subfield of $L$. We have the inclusions $K \\subseteq L \\subseteq \\mathfrak{C}$. We have also established the elementary relationships $K \\preceq \\mathfrak{C}$ and $L \\preceq \\mathfrak{C}$. The property of being an elementary substructure is transitive in the following sense: for substructures $A \\subseteq B \\subseteq C$, if $A \\preceq C$ and $B \\preceq C$, then $A \\preceq B$. To see this, let $\\psi(x_1, \\dots, x_k)$ be an $\\mathcal{L}$-formula and let $c_1, \\dots, c_k \\in K$. The elements $c_i$ are also in $L$. We have:\n$$\nK \\models \\psi(c_1, \\dots, c_k) \\iff \\mathfrak{C} \\models \\psi(c_1, \\dots, c_k) \\quad (\\text{since } K \\preceq \\mathfrak{C})\n$$\n$$\nL \\models \\psi(c_1, \\dots, c_k) \\iff \\mathfrak{C} \\models \\psi(c_1, \\dots, c_k) \\quad (\\text{since } L \\preceq \\mathfrak{C})\n$$\nFrom these two equivalences, it follows that $K \\models \\psi(c_1, \\dots, c_k) \\iff L \\models \\psi(c_1, \\dots, c_k)$. This holds for all formulas and parameters from $K$, which is the definition of $K \\preceq L$. Therefore, $L$ is an elementary extension of $K$.\n\nThe second task is to identify the field $L$ and determine its transcendence degree over $K$. The structure $L$ is the reduct of the Skolem hull $M$ of $K \\cup S$. The theory $\\mathrm{ACF}_{0}$ has quantifier elimination (QE). For a theory with QE, the Skolem hull of a set of parameters $A$ is identical to the model-theoretic algebraic closure of $A$, denoted $\\mathrm{acl}^{\\mathrm{mt}}(A)$. The set $\\mathrm{acl}^{\\mathrm{mt}}(A)$ consists of all elements that belong to a finite set definable with parameters from $A$.\nIn the specific context of algebraically closed fields, $\\mathrm{acl}^{\\mathrm{mt}}(A)$ of a set of parameters $A$ is precisely the field-theoretic algebraic closure of the field generated by $A$. The field generated by $K \\cup S$ is $K(S) = K(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$. Thus, the universe of $L$ is the algebraic closure of $K(S)$, which we denote $\\widetilde{K(S)}$.\nSo, field-theoretically, $L = \\widetilde{K(S)}$. This is an algebraically closed field containing $K(S)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the transcendence degree, $\\mathrm{trdeg}(L/K)$.\nWe have a tower of field extensions $K \\subseteq K(S) \\subseteq L$. The transcendence degree for such a tower is additive:\n$$\n\\mathrm{trdeg}(L/K) = \\mathrm{trdeg}(L/K(S)) + \\mathrm{trdeg}(K(S)/K)\n$$\nBy our identification of $L$, the extension $L/K(S)$ is algebraic. An extension is algebraic if and only if its transcendence degree is $0$. Thus, $\\mathrm{trdeg}(L/K(S)) = 0$.\nThis simplifies the equation to:\n$$\n\\mathrm{trdeg}(L/K) = \\mathrm{trdeg}(K(S)/K)\n$$\nWe are given that the set $S = \\{a_1, \\dots, a_n\\}$ is algebraically independent over $K$. By definition, this means $S$ is a transcendence basis for the field extension $K(S)/K$. The transcendence degree of a field extension is defined as the cardinality of any of its transcendence bases.\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{trdeg}(K(S)/K) = |S| = n$.\nFrom our initial calculation, $n=46$.\nWe conclude that the transcendence degree of $L$ over $K$ is $46$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{trdeg}(L/K) = 46\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{46}$$", "id": "2972441"}]}
