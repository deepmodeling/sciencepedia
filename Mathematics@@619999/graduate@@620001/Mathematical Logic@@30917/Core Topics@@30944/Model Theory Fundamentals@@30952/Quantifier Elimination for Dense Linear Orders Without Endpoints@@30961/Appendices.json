It provides a complete and consistent setup for which a unique solution can be derived. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe problem asks for two things based on the theory of dense linear orders without endpoints (DLO) over the language $\\{<\\}$. First, we must find a quantifier-free formula $\\psi(a,x)$ that is logically equivalent to the given formula $\\varphi(x) := \\exists y\\,(a<y<x)$. Second, we must interpret the set of elements $x$ satisfying $\\varphi(x)$ as an interval and determine its left and right endpoints. The parameter $a$ is a constant from the domain of a model of DLO.\n\nThe theory DLO is defined by the following axioms:\n1.  **Linear Order**: The relation $<$ is a strict linear order, meaning it is irreflexive ($\\forall u\\, \\neg(u<u)$), transitive ($\\forall u,v,w\\, ((u<v \\land v<w) \\to u<w)$), and total ($\\forall u,v\\, (u<v \\lor u=v \\lor v<u)$).\n2.  **Density**: For any two elements where one is less than the other, there is an element between them: $\\forall u,v\\,(u<v \\to \\exists w\\,(u<w<v))$.\n3.  **No Endpoints**: For any element, there is a smaller element and a larger element: $\\forall u\\,(\\exists v\\,(v<u) \\land \\exists w\\,(u<w))$.\n\nWe begin by finding the quantifier-free equivalent of $\\varphi(x) := \\exists y\\,(a<y<x)$. The formula states that there exists an element $y$ strictly between the parameter $a$ and the variable $x$. We will show that this is equivalent to the simple atomic formula $a<x$.\n\nLet's prove the equivalence $\\exists y\\,(a<y<x) \\iff a<x$.\n\nFirst, we prove the forward implication: $\\exists y\\,(a<y<x) \\to a<x$.\nAssume that $\\exists y\\,(a<y<x)$ is true in a given model of DLO. By the definition of the existential quantifier, this means there is an element in the domain, which we may call $y_0$, such that the condition $a < y_0 \\land y_0 < x$ holds. The axiom of transitivity for a linear order states that for any elements $u, v, w$, if $u<v$ and $v<w$, then $u<w$. Applying this axiom with $u=a$, $v=y_0$, and $w=x$, we deduce from $a < y_0$ and $y_0 < x$ that $a<x$. This completes the proof of the forward implication.\n\nNext, we prove the reverse implication: $a<x \\to \\exists y\\,(a<y<x)$.\nAssume that $a<x$ is true. The axiom of density states that for any two elements $u,v$ satisfying $u<v$, there exists an element $w$ such that $u<w<v$. We apply this axiom to our assumption $a<x$ by setting $u=a$ and $v=x$. The axiom guarantees the existence of an element, which we can call $y$, such that $a<y<x$. The existence of such a $y$ is precisely what the formula $\\exists y\\,(a<y<x)$ asserts. This completes the proof of the reverse implication.\n\nSince we have shown both implications, we have established that $\\varphi(x) \\iff a<x$ in all models of DLO. The formula $\\psi(a,x) := a<x$ is a quantifier-free formula, as it is an atomic formula in the language $\\{<\\}$ with parameters.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part of the task: interpreting the set of realizations of $x$ as an interval and finding its endpoints. The set of elements $x$ for which $\\varphi(x)$ is true is given by $S = \\{x \\mid \\varphi(x)\\}$. Based on our quantifier elimination, this set is $S = \\{x \\mid a<x\\}$. This is the set of all elements in the domain that are strictly greater than $a$. In interval notation, this corresponds to an open ray $(a, +\\infty)$.\n\nWe must identify the left and right endpoints of this interval.\n\nThe left endpoint, $L$, is the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the set $S$.\nFirst, we show that $a$ is a lower bound for $S$. By the definition of $S$, for any $x \\in S$, the condition $a<x$ holds. Thus, $a$ is a lower bound for $S$.\nSecond, we show that $a$ is the *greatest* lower bound. Let $b$ be any lower bound for $S$. To show $a$ is the greatest, we must prove that $b \\le a$. We proceed by contradiction. Assume $a < b$. According to the density axiom, since $a<b$, there must exist an element $c$ such that $a<c<b$. Since $a<c$, the element $c$ is in the set $S$. However, since $c<b$, the element $b$ cannot be a lower bound for $S$, as we have found an element of $S$ that is smaller than $b$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, our assumption $a<b$ must be false. Given the trichotomy axiom, it must be that $b \\le a$. Since any lower bound $b$ is less than or equal to $a$, $a$ is the greatest lower bound of $S$. Thus, the left endpoint is $L=a$.\n\nThe right endpoint, $R$, is the least upper bound (supremum) of the set $S$.\nWe will show that the set $S$ has no upper bound within the domain. We proceed by contradiction. Assume there exists an element $B$ in the domain that is an upper bound for $S$. This means that for all $x \\in S$, $x \\le B$.\nThe set $S$ is $\\{x \\mid a<x\\}$ and is non-empty due to the no-endpoint axiom, which guarantees an element larger than $a$. For $B$ to be an upper bound, it must hold that $x \\le B$ for all $x > a$. This implies that $B$ must be greater than $a$; if $B \\le a$, we could find an element $z > a$ (by the no-endpoint axiom), and then $z \\in S$ but $z>a \\ge B$, which contradicts $B$ being an upper bound. So, we must have $a<B$.\nNow, consider this upper bound $B$. The axiom of no endpoints states that for any element $u$, there exists an element $w$ such that $u<w$. Let's apply this to $B$. There exists an element $w$ in the domain such that $B<w$. Since we have $a<B$ and $B<w$, by transitivity we conclude that $a<w$. This means $w \\in S$. But we also have $B<w$, which contradicts the assumption that $B$ is an upper bound for $S$.\nTherefore, the set $S$ has no upper bound in any model of DLO. Following the convention given in the problem statement, we denote the non-existent right endpoint as $R = +\\infty$.\n\nThe ordered pair of endpoints $(L, R)$ is thus $(a, +\\infty)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} a & +\\infty \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$"}, {"introduction": "Logical formulas often involve a combination of existential and universal quantifiers linked by connectives.

We analyze this using the axioms of DLO.\n\n1.  Assume the quantifier-free formula $x<b$ is true. The axiom of density for DLO states that for any two elements $u$ and $v$ with $u<v$, there exists an element $w$ such that $u<w<v$. Applying this principle with $u=x$ and $v=b$, the condition $x<b$ guarantees the existence of an element, which we can call $y$, such that $x<y<b$. This $y$ satisfies the predicate $(x<y \\land y<b)$. Therefore, the existential statement $\\Phi_1 \\equiv \\exists y\\,(x<y \\land y<b)$ is true. This establishes that $(x<b) \\models_{\\text{DLO}} \\Phi_1$.\n\n2.  Assume $\\Phi_1$ is true. This means there exists an element $y$ such that $x<y$ and $y<b$. By the transitivity property of a linear order (an axiom of DLO), the conditions $x<y$ and $y<b$ together imply $x<b$. This establishes that $\\Phi_1 \\models_{\\text{DLO}} (x<b)$.\n\nCombining these two implications, we conclude that $\\Phi_1$ is logically equivalent to the quantifier-free formula $x<b$ in the theory DLO.\n$$\n\\exists y\\,(x<y \\land y<b) \\Leftrightarrow x<b\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Quantifier Elimination for $\\Phi_2$**\n\nThe formula $\\Phi_2$ asserts that for any element $z$, if $z$ is less than $a$, then $z$ is also less than $x$. This is a statement about the relationship between the initial segments $(-\\infty, a)$ and $(-\\infty, x)$.\n\n1.  Assume the quantifier-free formula $a \\le x$ is true. This is shorthand for $(a<x) \\lor (a=x)$.\n    - If $a<x$, let $z$ be an arbitrary element such that $z<a$. By transitivity, $z<a$ and $a<x$ implies $z<x$.\n    - If $a=x$, the condition $z<a$ is identical to $z<x$.\n    In both cases, for any $z$, if $z<a$, then $z<x$. Thus, the universal statement $\\Phi_2 \\equiv \\forall z\\,(z<a \\rightarrow z<x)$ is true. This establishes that $(a \\le x) \\models_{\\text{DLO}} \\Phi_2$.\n\n2.  Assume $\\neg(a \\le x)$, which in a linear order is equivalent to $x<a$. By the axiom of density, since $x<a$, there exists an element, which we can call $z_0$, such that $x<z_0<a$. For this particular element $z_0$:\n    - The premise of the implication in $\\Phi_2$, $z_0<a$, is true.\n    - The conclusion of the implication, $z_0<x$, is false, since we have $x<z_0$.\n    An implication with a true premise and a false conclusion is false. Therefore, we have found a counterexample $z_0$ that falsifies the statement $(z<a \\rightarrow z<x)$. This means the universal quantification $\\Phi_2$ is false. This establishes that if $\\Phi_2$ is true, then $a \\le x$ must be true, i.e., $\\Phi_2 \\models_{\\text{DLO}} (a \\le x)$.\n\nCombining these two implications, we conclude that $\\Phi_2$ is logically equivalent to the quantifier-free formula $a \\le x$.\n$$\n\\forall z\\,(z<a \\rightarrow z<x) \\Leftrightarrow a \\le x\n$$\nIn the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{<\\}$, the relation $a \\le x$ is an abbreviation for $(a<x) \\lor (a=x)$.\n\n**Part 3: Final Quantifier-Free Formula and Counting**\n\nBy substituting the derived quantifier-free equivalents back into the original formula, we obtain:\n$$\n\\varphi(x,a,b) \\Leftrightarrow (x<b) \\lor (a \\le x)\n$$\nExpanding the abbreviation for $\\le$, we get the formula in disjunctive normal form as a disjunction of atomic relations (and an equality, which is definable from $<$):\n$$\n\\varphi(x,a,b) \\Leftrightarrow (x<b) \\lor (a<x) \\lor (a=x)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nFor the second part, we are given the additional condition that the elements $a$, $x$, and $b$ are pairwise distinct. This implies that $a \\neq x$, $x \\neq b$, and $a \\neq b$. Under this condition, the term $(a=x)$ in the disjunction is always false. The formula $\\varphi(x,a,b)$ thus simplifies to the equivalent formula $\\varphi'(x,a,b)$:\n$$\n\\varphi'(x,a,b) \\Leftrightarrow (x<b) \\lor (a<x)\n$$\nWe must now count the number of strict linear orders on the set $\\{a, x, b\\}$ that satisfy $\\varphi'(x,a,b)$. The total number of distinct strict linear orders on a set of $3$ elements is $3! = 6$.\n\nAn order satisfies $\\varphi'(x,a,b)$ if it satisfies at least one of the disjuncts. It is simpler to count the number of orders that do *not* satisfy $\\varphi'(x,a,b)$ and subtract this from the total. An order fails to satisfy $\\varphi'(x,a,b)$ if and only if the negation, $\\neg((x<b) \\lor (a<x))$, is true.\nBy De Morgan's laws, this negation is equivalent to:\n$$\n\\neg(x<b) \\land \\neg(a<x)\n$$\nSince we are in a strict linear order and the elements are distinct, $\\neg(u<v)$ is equivalent to $v<u$. Thus, the formula is false if and only if:\n$$\n(b<x) \\land (x<a)\n$$\nBy the transitivity of the order relation $<$, this conjunction defines a single, unique linear order on the set $\\{a, x, b\\}$:\n$$\nb < x < a\n$$\nTherefore, out of the $6$ possible linear orders on $\\{a, x, b\\}$, exactly one order makes the formula $\\varphi'(x,a,b)$ false.

The graph of this function, for $(x,y)$ with $x \\in D$, is given by the formula $\\Gamma(x,y)$.\n\n**1. Quantifier Elimination**\n\nThe first task is to eliminate the quantifiers in the formula $\\Gamma(x,y)$ and express it in disjunctive normal form (DNF). The given formula is:\n$$\n\\Gamma(x,y) \\equiv \\bigl(y\\in A \\wedge x<y \\wedge \\forall z\\,(z\\in A \\wedge x<z \\rightarrow y\\leq z)\\bigr)\n$$\nHere, $u \\in A$ is an abbreviation for $\\bigvee_{k=1}^{n} u=a_{k}$.\n\nThe core of the task is to eliminate the universal quantifier in the subformula $\\forall z\\,(z\\in A \\wedge x<z \\rightarrow y\\leq z)$. Let's analyze this subformula. It states that for any element $z$ in the domain, if $z$ is in the set $A$ and $x<z$, then $y \\leq z$. The quantifier $\\forall z$ ranges over the entire set $M = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nConsider an element $z_0 \\in M$.\n- If $z_0 \\notin A$, the premise $(z_0 \\in A \\wedge x<z_0)$ is false. Therefore, the implication $(z_0 \\in A \\wedge x<z_0 \\rightarrow y\\leq z_0)$ is vacuously true.\n- If $z_0 \\in A$, for the implication to hold, we must have $(x<z_0 \\rightarrow y\\leq z_0)$.\n\nSince the implication is always true for any $z \\notin A$, the universal statement is true if and only if the implication holds for all elements $z \\in A$. The set $A$ is finite, $A = \\{a_1, \\dots, a_n\\}$. Thus, the quantified statement is equivalent to a finite conjunction:\n$$\n\\forall z\\,(z\\in A \\wedge x<z \\rightarrow y\\leq z) \\equiv \\bigwedge_{j=1}^{n} (x<a_{j} \\rightarrow y\\leq a_{j})\n$$\nUsing the logical equivalence $P \\rightarrow Q \\equiv \\neg P \\vee Q$, we can rewrite this as:\n$$\n\\bigwedge_{j=1}^{n} (x \\geq a_{j} \\vee y \\leq a_{j})\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Gamma(x,y)$, we obtain the quantifier-free formula:\n$$\n\\Gamma(x,y) \\equiv \\left(\\bigvee_{i=1}^{n} y=a_{i}\\right) \\wedge x<y \\wedge \\left(\\bigwedge_{j=1}^{n} (x \\geq a_j \\vee y \\leq a_j)\\right)\n$$\nTo convert this into DNF, we distribute the first disjunction over the rest of the expression:\n$$\n\\Gamma(x,y) \\equiv \\bigvee_{i=1}^{n} \\left( y=a_{i} \\wedge x<y \\wedge \\bigwedge_{j=1}^{n} (x \\geq a_j \\vee y \\leq a_j) \\right)\n$$\nNow, within each disjunct, we substitute $y=a_{i}$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(x,y) \\equiv \\bigvee_{i=1}^{n} \\left( y=a_{i} \\wedge x<a_{i} \\wedge \\bigwedge_{j=1}^{n} (x \\geq a_j \\vee a_i \\leq a_j) \\right)\n$$\nLet's simplify the conjunction $\\bigwedge_{j=1}^{n} (x \\geq a_j \\vee a_i \\leq a_j)$ for a fixed $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$. We use the fact that $a_{1} < a_{2} < \\cdots < a_{n}$.\n- For any $j$ such that $j \\geq i$, the condition $a_{i} \\leq a_{j}$ is true. Thus, the clause $(x \\geq a_j \\vee a_i \\leq a_j)$ is true.\n- For any $j$ such that $j < i$, the condition $a_{i} \\leq a_{j}$ is false. Thus, the clause $(x \\geq a_j \\vee a_i \\leq a_j)$ simplifies to $x \\geq a_{j}$.\n\nTherefore, the conjunction simplifies as follows:\n$$\n\\bigwedge_{j=1}^{n} (x \\geq a_j \\vee a_i \\leq a_j) \\equiv \\bigwedge_{j=1}^{i-1} (x \\geq a_{j})\n$$\nFor $i=1$, the conjunction is over an empty set of indices, which is vacuously true. For $i > 1$, since $a_{1} < \\cdots < a_{i-1}$, the condition $\\bigwedge_{j=1}^{i-1} x \\geq a_{j}$ is equivalent to its strongest component, which is $x \\geq a_{i-1}$.\n\nLet's apply this simplification to each disjunct of $\\Gamma(x,y)$:\n- For $i=1$: The term is $y=a_{1} \\wedge x<a_{1} \\wedge (\\text{TRUE})$, which is $y=a_{1} \\wedge x<a_{1}$.\n- For $i \\in \\{2,\\dots,n\\}$: The term is $y=a_{i} \\wedge x<a_{i} \\wedge x \\geq a_{i-1}$, which can be written as $y=a_{i} \\wedge a_{i-1} \\leq x < a_{i}$.\n\nCombining these results, we obtain the final quantifier-free formula $\\Gamma_{0}(x,y)$ in DNF:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{0}(x,y) \\equiv (y=a_{1} \\wedge x<a_{1}) \\vee \\bigvee_{i=2}^{n} (y=a_{i} \\wedge a_{i-1} \\leq x < a_{i})\n$$\nThis formula consists of atomic formulas of the form $y=a_i$, $x<a_i$, and $a_{i-1}\\leq x$, as requested.\n\n**2. Partition of the Domain and Behavior of $f$**\n\nThe second task is to use the quantifier-free formula $\\Gamma_0(x,y)$ to describe the function $f(x)$. The formula $\\Gamma_0(x,y)$ is true if and only if $y=f(x)$. The DNF structure naturally gives a piecewise definition of the function. The domain of $f$ is $(-\\infty, a_{n})$, which is the union of the intervals for $x$ found in $\\Gamma_{0}(x,y)$.\n\nWe can analyze each disjunct to describe $f(x)$ on a corresponding interval of its domain:\n- The first disjunct $(y=a_{1} \\wedge x<a_{1})$ implies that if $x < a_{1}$, then $y=f(x)=a_{1}$. This holds on the interval $(-\\infty, a_{1})$.\n- For $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}$, the disjunct $(y=a_{i} \\wedge a_{i-1} \\leq x < a_{i})$ implies that if $a_{i-1} \\leq x < a_{i}$, then $y=f(x)=a_{i}$. This holds on the interval $[a_{i-1}, a_{i})$.\n\nThis partitions the function's domain $D=(-\\infty, a_{n})$ into $n$ disjoint convex cells:\n$$\n(-\\infty, a_{1}), [a_{1}, a_{2}), [a_{2}, a_{3}), \\dots, [a_{n-1}, a_{n})\n$$\nThe behavior of $f$ on each cell is as follows:\n- For $x \\in (-\\infty, a_{1})$, $f(x) = a_{1}$.\n- For $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, n\\}$, for $x \\in [a_{i-1}, a_{i})$, $f(x) = a_{i}$.\n\nThis piecewise-constant description matches the original definition $f(x) = \\min\\{a \\in A \\mid x < a\\}$. For instance, if $a_{i-1} \\leq x < a_i$, the set $\\{a \\in A \\mid x < a\\}$ is $\\{a_i, a_{i+1}, \\dots, a_n\\}$, whose minimum is indeed $a_i$.\n\n**3. Closed-Form Analytic Expression for $f(x)$**\n\nThe third task is to provide a single closed-form analytic expression for $f(x)$ on its domain $(-\\infty, a_{n})$ using the parameters $a_i$ and indicator functions $\\chi_I$. The indicator function $\\chi_I(x)$ is $1$ if $x \\in I$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nBased on the piecewise description from Task 2, we can express $f(x)$ as a weighted sum of indicator functions for the intervals in our partition. Each term in the sum will be the value of the function on an interval multiplied by the indicator function of that interval.\n\nThe function is given by:\n- $f(x) = a_{1}$ on $I_1 = (-\\infty, a_{1})$\n- $f(x) = a_{2}$ on $I_2 = [a_{1}, a_{2})$\n- ...\n- $f(x) = a_{i}$ on $I_i = [a_{i-1}, a_{i})$ for $i \\geq 2$\n- ...\n- $f(x) = a_{n}$ on $I_n = [a_{n-1}, a_{n})$\n\nThis can be written as:\n$$\nf(x) = a_{1} \\chi_{I_1}(x) + a_{2} \\chi_{I_2}(x) + \\cdots + a_{n} \\chi_{I_n}(x)\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of the intervals $I_i$ and using summation notation, we get the single closed-form expression for $f(x)$ on its domain $(-\\infty, a_{n})$:\n$$\nf(x) = a_{1} \\chi_{(-\\infty, a_{1})}(x) + \\sum_{i=2}^{n} a_{i} \\chi_{[a_{i-1}, a_{i})}(x)\n$$\nFor any $x \\in (-\\infty, a_{n})$, exactly one of the indicator functions in this expression will be equal to $1$, and all others will be $0$. This expression is therefore the required closed-form representation of the function $f$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{a_{1} \\chi_{(-\\infty, a_{1})}(x) + \\sum_{i=2}^{n} a_{i} \\chi_{[a_{i-1}, a_{i})}(x)}\n$$"}]}
