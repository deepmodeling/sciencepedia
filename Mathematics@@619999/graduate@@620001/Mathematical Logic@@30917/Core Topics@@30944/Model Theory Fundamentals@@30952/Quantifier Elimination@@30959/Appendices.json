The theory of Dense Linear Orders without Endpoints ($T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$) is a classical example of a theory that admits quantifier elimination. All terms are formally defined, the axioms are standard, and the tasks are procedurally clear and unambiguous. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded in mathematical logic, and well-posed. There are no contradictions, missing information, or subjective elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Quantifier-Free Formula**\n\nThe first task is to find a quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x,z)$ that is equivalent to $\\varphi(x,z) \\equiv \\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)$ in the theory $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$. This equivalence means that for any model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ and any assignment of elements from the domain of $\\mathcal{M}$ to $x$ and $z$, the formulas $\\varphi(x,z)$ and $\\psi(x,z)$ have the same truth value. We demonstrate the equivalence $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}} \\models (\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)) \\leftrightarrow (xz)$.\n\n$1$. Proof of $(\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)) \\rightarrow (xz)$:\nAssume that for a given assignment of $x$ and $z$, the formula $\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)$ is true. This means there exists an element, let's call it $y_0$, such that $x  y_0$ and $y_0  z$. The theory $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ includes the axiom of transitivity for a strict linear order: $\\forall x,y,z\\,((xy\\wedge yz)\\rightarrow xz)$. Applying this axiom with $y_0$ in place of $y$, from the premise $(x  y_0 \\wedge y_0  z)$, we can deduce the conclusion $xz$. Thus, this implication holds in any model of $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$.\n\n$2$. Proof of $(xz) \\rightarrow (\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz))$:\nAssume that for a given assignment of $x$ and $z$, the formula $xz$ is true. The theory $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ includes the density axiom: $\\forall x,z\\,(xz\\rightarrow \\exists y\\,(xy\\wedge yz))$. This axiom directly states that if $xz$ holds, then $\\exists y\\,(xy\\wedge yz)$ must also hold.\n\nSince both implications are provable from the axioms of $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$, the formula $\\exists y\\,(xy \\wedge yz)$ is logically equivalent to $xz$ within this theory. The formula $xz$ is quantifier-free and depends only on the free variables $x$ and $z$.\nTherefore, the equivalent quantifier-free formula is:\n$$ \\psi(x,z) \\equiv xz $$\n\n**Justification regarding Quantifier Elimination and Decidability**\n\nThe theory $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ admits quantifier elimination. This means that for any formula $\\phi$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{\\}$, there is an equivalent quantifier-free formula $\\psi$. The derivation above is a concrete instance of this principle. We started with a formula $\\varphi(x,z)$ containing a quantifier and, by using the axioms of the theory, produced an equivalent formula $\\psi(x,z)$ that is free of quantifiers.\n\nThis property is fundamental to proving that $T_{\\mathrm{DLO}}$ is a decidable theory. A theory is decidable if there exists an algorithm that can determine, for any given sentence $\\sigma$ (a formula with no free variables), whether $\\sigma$ is a theorem of the theory ($T_{\\mathrm{DLO}} \\models \\sigma$). The existence of a constructive procedure for quantifier elimination provides such an algorithm.\nFor any sentence $\\sigma$, we can mechanically apply the quantifier elimination algorithm to produce an equivalent quantifier-free sentence $\\sigma'$. Since $\\sigma'$ has no free variables and no quantifiers, and the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{\\}$ has no constants, $\\sigma'$ must be a universally valid statement (a tautology, $\\top$) or a contradiction ($\\bot$). Its truth value can be determined by simple inspection. Since $\\sigma$ is equivalent to $\\sigma'$, this determines the truth value of $\\sigma$ within the theory. This algorithmic process for determining the truth of any sentence makes the theory decidable.\n\n**Computation of the Gödel Number**\n\nThe final task is to compute the Gödel number of the resulting quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x,z)$, which is $xz$. The formula is viewed as a sequence of symbols $s_0s_1s_2$.\n\nThe sequence of symbols is $(x, , z)$. The length of the sequence is $n=3$.\nFrom the provided table, we extract the codes for these symbols:\n- $\\mathrm{code}(s_0) = \\mathrm{code}(x) = 11$\n- $\\mathrm{code}(s_1) = \\mathrm{code}() = 7$\n- $\\mathrm{code}(s_2) = \\mathrm{code}(z) = 13$\n\nThe Gödel number is defined by the product $G(s_{0}s_{1}\\cdots s_{n-1}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}^{\\,\\mathrm{code}(s_{i-1})}$, where $p_i$ is the $i$-th prime number. We need the first $3$ prime numbers:\n- $p_1 = 2$\n- $p_2 = 3$\n- $p_3 = 5$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $G(\\psi) = G(xz)$:\n$$ G(xz) = p_1^{\\mathrm{code}(x)} \\times p_2^{\\mathrm{code}()} \\times p_3^{\\mathrm{code}(z)} $$\n$$ G(xz) = 2^{11} \\times 3^7 \\times 5^{13} $$\nThis expression is the exact, closed-form required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2^{11} \\times 3^{7} \\times 5^{13}}$$", "id": "2971288"}, {"introduction": "We now advance from pure order to the richer structure of Real Closed Fields (RCF), the theory that captures the first-order properties of the real numbers.

The Tarski-Seidenberg theorem guarantees that RCF admits quantifier elimination, which ensures the existence of such a formula. We shall demonstrate that the formula $\\psi(x) \\equiv (0 \\leq x)$ is logically equivalent to $\\varphi(x)$ in RCF.\n\nTo establish this equivalence, we must prove that the theory of RCF entails the universal closure of the corresponding biconditional statement, which is formally written as $T_{RCF} \\models \\forall x (\\varphi(x) \\leftrightarrow \\psi(x))$. This requires proving the equivalence by demonstrating two separate implications.\n\n1. Proof of $T_{RCF} \\models \\forall x ((\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x)) \\rightarrow (0 \\leq x))$:\nLet $K$ be any model of RCF, which is by definition an ordered field. Let $a$ be an element in the domain of $K$ such that the formula $\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=a)$ is satisfied in $K$. By the semantics of first-order logic, this means there exists an element $b \\in K$ such that the equality $b^{2}=a$ holds. The problem statement provides as Fact (i) that in any ordered field, every square is non-negative. Since $K$ is an ordered field, we must have $b^{2} \\geq 0$. From the equality $b^{2}=a$, it directly follows that $a \\geq 0$. In the language $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{or}}$, this is written as $0 \\leq a$. Since this argument holds for any arbitrary element $a$ in any model $K$ of RCF, the implication $(\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x)) \\rightarrow (0 \\leq x)$ is a theorem of RCF.\n\n2. Proof of $T_{RCF} \\models \\forall x ((0 \\leq x) \\rightarrow (\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x)))$:\nLet $K$ again be any model of RCF. Let $a$ be an element in the domain of $K$ such that the condition $0 \\leq a$ is satisfied. The problem statement provides as Fact (ii) that a defining property of a real closed field is that every non-negative element is a square. Since $a$ is a non-negative element of $K$, there must exist some element $b \\in K$ such that $b^{2} = a$. This means that the formula $\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=a)$ is satisfied in $K$. Since this argument holds for any arbitrary non-negative element $a$ in any model $K$ of RCF, the implication $(0 \\leq x) \\rightarrow (\\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x))$ is also a theorem of RCF.\n\nBy combining both proven implications, we have rigorously established that the formula $\\varphi(x) \\equiv \\exists y\\,(y^{2}=x)$ is equivalent in RCF to the quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x) \\equiv (0 \\leq x)$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an analysis in the standard model of RCF, which is the field of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ equipped with its usual addition, multiplication, and ordering. The definable set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers $x$ that satisfy the formula $\\varphi(x)$. Using the equivalence we just proved, we can characterize this set:\n$$S = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\mathbb{R} \\models \\varphi(x) \\} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\mathbb{R} \\models (0 \\leq x) \\} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x \\geq 0 \\}$$\nTherefore, the set $S$ is the interval of non-negative real numbers, $[0, \\infty)$.\n\nWe are asked to determine the number of connected components of the set $S \\cap [-1,1]$. We first compute this intersection explicitly:\n$$S \\cap [-1,1] = [0, \\infty) \\cap [-1,1] = [0,1]$$\nThe resulting set is the closed and bounded interval $[0,1]$.\n\nIn the standard Euclidean topology on $\\mathbb{R}$, a fundamental theorem of point-set topology states that a subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if it is an interval. Since the set $[0,1]$ is an interval, it is a connected set.
