Express your final answer only as the row matrix of the two Skolem terms.", "solution": "The process of Skolemization transforms a first-order logic formula into an equisatisfiable formula in Skolem normal form, which is a formula in prenex normal form containing only universal quantifiers. The core principle is to replace each existentially quantified variable with a term called a Skolem term. This term consists of a new function symbol, called a Skolem function, applied to all universally quantified variables whose quantifiers appear earlier in the prenex form (i.e., whose scope includes the existential quantifier being eliminated).\n\nThe given sentence is $$\\forall x \\,\\exists y \\,\\exists z \\, S(x,y,z).$$\nThe purported Skolemization is $$\\forall x \\, S\\big(x,f(x),f(x)\\big).$$\n\nThe precise logical error in this proposed transformation lies in the reuse of the same Skolem function term, $f(x)$, to replace two distinct existentially quantified variables, $y$ and $z$. The original sentence asserts that for any given $x$, there exist a value for $y$ and a value for $z$ that satisfy the predicate $S$. These two values, $y$ and $z$, are not required to be identical. The formula $\\exists y \\,\\exists z \\, S(x,y,z)$ makes no claim about the equality or inequality of the witnesses for $y$ and $z$.\n\nBy replacing both $y$ and $z$ with the identical term $f(x)$, the purported Skolemization implicitly introduces the constraint $y=z$. The resulting formula, $\\forall x \\, S\\big(x,f(x),f(x)\\big)$, asserts that for any $x$, there exists a single value, let's call it $w = f(x)$, such that $S(x,w,w)$ holds. This is a logically stronger statement than the original. A formula $\\Phi$ logically implies a formula $\\Psi$ (written $\\Phi \\models \\Psi$) if every model of $\\Phi$ is also a model of $\\Psi$. In this case, $\\forall x \\, \\exists w \\, S(x,w,w)$ implies $\\forall x \\, \\exists y \\, \\exists z \\, S(x,y,z)$ (by simply choosing $y=w$ and $z=w$), but the converse does not hold. The purported Skolemization is therefore not logically equivalent to the original formula.\n\nMore importantly, Skolemization is required to preserve satisfiability (i.e., be equisatisfiable), not logical equivalence. The error can destroy satisfiability. Let's demonstrate this with a model-theoretic argument. A formula is satisfiable if there exists at least one model (a domain of discourse and an interpretation of symbols) in which it is true.\nLet the domain of discourse be the set of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\nLet the predicate $S(x,y,z)$ be interpreted as the relation $y + z = x$.\n\nThe original sentence becomes:\n$$\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\,\\, \\exists y \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\,\\, \\exists z \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\,\\, (y+z=x).$$\nThis statement is true in the standard model of integers. For any integer $x$, we can always find suitable integers $y$ and $z$. For example, we can choose $y=0$ and $z=x$. Since such a model exists, the original formula is satisfiable.\n\nNow, consider the purported Skolemization under the same interpretation:\n$$\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\,\\, (f(x) + f(x) = x).$$\nThis simplifies to $\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\,\\, (2f(x) = x)$. This statement asserts that for every integer $x$, there exists an integer $f(x)$ (the witness) such that $2$ times that integer equals $x$. This is false. For any odd integer, such as $x=1$, there is no integer $w$ such that $2w = 1$. Consequently, no function $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ can exist that satisfies this property for all $x$. The purported Skolemized formula is unsatisfiable over the integers.\n\nSince the original formula is satisfiable but the incorrectly Skolemized formula is not, the erroneous procedure has destroyed satisfiability, which violates the fundamental requirement of the Skolemization process.\n\nTo derive the correct Skolem normal form, we must introduce a unique Skolem function for each existential quantifier.\nThe original formula is $\\forall x \\,\\exists y \\,\\exists z \\, S(x,y,z)$.\n1.  The first existential quantifier is $\\exists y$. It is within the scope of the universal quantifier $\\forall x$. We must therefore replace $y$ with a term $f(x)$, where $f$ is a new function symbol of arity $1$. The formula becomes $\\forall x \\,\\exists z \\, S(x,f(x),z)$.\n2.  The second existential quantifier is $\\exists z$. It is also within the scope of $\\forall x$. We must replace $z$ with a term $g(x)$, where $g$ is another new function symbol of arity $1$, distinct from $f$.\n\nThe correct Skolem normal form is therefore:\n$$\\forall x \\, S\\big(x,f(x),g(x)\\big).$$\nThis formula is equisatisfiable with the original. If the original formula is true in a model, then for each $x$, there exist $y_x$ and $z_x$. We can define the interpretations of the functions $f$ and $g$ as $f(x) = y_x$ and $g(x) = z_x$. Conversely, if the Skolemized formula is true in a model with interpretations for $f$ and $g$, then for any $x$, we can choose $y = f(x)$ and $z = g(x)$ to satisfy the original formula.\n\nThe ordered pair of Skolem terms that correctly witness the existential quantifiers for $y$ and $z$ are $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, respectively.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} f(x) & g(x) \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2982829"}, {"introduction": "This final, comprehensive practice synthesizes the previous concepts into a complete workflow from a logical sentence to a proof of its unsatisfiability.

Conversion to Prenex Normal Form (PNF)**\n\nThe goal is to move all quantifiers to the front of the formula. The sentence is a conjunction of three subformulas, where the quantified variables ($x$, $y$, $z$) are distinct. We can pull the quantifiers out one by one using standard logical equivalences. A quantifier $\\mathcal{Q}v$ can be moved out of a conjunction $(\\mathcal{Q}v\\, A(v)) \\wedge B$ to form $\\mathcal{Q}v\\,(A(v) \\wedge B)$ provided that $v$ is not a free variable in $B$.\n\nLet's begin with $\\Phi_n$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{n} = \\bigl(\\exists x\\, P(x)\\bigr)\\;\\wedge\\;\\bigl(\\forall y\\,(P(y)\\rightarrow P(f(y)))\\bigr)\\;\\wedge\\;\\bigl(\\forall z\\,\\neg P(f^{n}(z))\\bigr)\n$$\nFirst, we move the existential quantifier $\\exists x$.

This transformation preserves logical equivalence.\n$$\n\\Phi_{n} \\equiv \\exists x \\left( P(x) \\;\\wedge\\; \\bigl(\\forall y\\,(P(y)\\rightarrow P(f(y)))\\bigr)\\;\\wedge\\;\\bigl(\\forall z\\,\\neg P(f^{n}(z))\\bigr) \\right)\n$$\nNext, we move the universal quantifier $\\forall y$. The variable $y$ does not appear free in $P(x)$ or in the third conjunct. This step also preserves logical equivalence.\n$$\n\\Phi_{n} \\equiv \\exists x \\forall y \\left( P(x) \\;\\wedge\\; (P(y)\\rightarrow P(f(y)))\\;\\wedge\\;\\bigl(\\forall z\\,\\neg P(f^{n}(z))\\bigr) \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we move the universal quantifier $\\forall z$. The variable $z$ does not appear free in $P(x) \\wedge (P(y)\\rightarrow P(f(y)))$. This step preserves logical equivalence.\n$$\n\\Phi_{n} \\equiv \\exists x \\forall y \\forall z \\left( P(x) \\;\\wedge\\; (P(y)\\rightarrow P(f(y)))\\;\\wedge\\; \\neg P(f^{n}(z)) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the Prenex Normal Form of $\\Phi_n$. The prefix is $\\exists x \\forall y \\forall z$ and the matrix is $P(x) \\wedge (P(y)\\rightarrow P(f(y))) \\wedge \\neg P(f^{n}(z))$.\n\n**2. Skolemization and Conversion to CNF**\n\nWe start with the PNF. Skolemization eliminates existential quantifiers. The transformation preserves equisatisfiability, but not logical equivalence.\nThe PNF is $\\exists x \\forall y \\forall z M(x, y, z)$, where $M$ is the matrix.\nThe existential quantifier $\\exists x$ is the outermost. It is not in the scope of any universal quantifier. We replace the variable $x$ with a new Skolem constant (a function of arity $0$), which we name $c$.\nThe resulting formula is:\n$$\n\\forall y \\forall z \\left( P(c) \\;\\wedge\\; (P(y)\\rightarrow P(f(y)))\\;\\wedge\\; \\neg P(f^{n}(z)) \\right)\n$$\nNext, we drop the universal quantifiers, with the understanding that the variables $y$ and $z$ are universally quantified over the entire formula. This gives the quantifier-free matrix:\n$$\nP(c) \\;\\wedge\\; (P(y)\\rightarrow P(f(y)))\\;\\wedge\\; \\neg P(f^{n}(z))\n$$\nNow, we convert this matrix into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), which is a conjunction of clauses (disjunctions of literals).\nThe first conjunct, $P(c)$, is a literal and thus a clause.\nThe second conjunct, $P(y)\\rightarrow P(f(y))$, is converted using the equivalence $A \\rightarrow B \\equiv \\neg A \\vee B$. This yields the clause $\\neg P(y) \\vee P(f(y))$.\nThe third conjunct, $\\neg P(f^{n}(z))$, is a literal and thus a clause.\nThe resulting CNF formula is:\n$$\nP(c) \\;\\wedge\\; (\\neg P(y) \\vee P(f(y))) \\;\\wedge\\; \\neg P(f^{n}(z))\n$$\nThe corresponding set of clauses, which is the standard input for resolution, is:\n$$\nS = \\left\\{ \\{P(c)\\}, \\{\\neg P(y), P(f(y))\\}, \\{\\neg P(f^{n}(z))\\} \\right\\}\n$$\n\n**3. Herbrand Universe, Herbrand Base, and Minimal Unsatisfiable Depth**\n\nThe language of the clause set $S$ contains one constant symbol $c$, one unary function symbol $f$, and one unary predicate symbol $P$.\n\nThe **Herbrand Universe** $\\mathcal{U}$ is the set of all ground terms constructible from the constants and function symbols.\n$$\n\\mathcal{U} = \\{c, f(c), f(f(c)), \\dots\\} = \\{ f^k(c) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0 \\}\n$$\nwhere $f^0(c)$ denotes $c$.\n\nThe **Herbrand Base** $\\mathcal{B}$ is the set of all ground atoms.\n$$\n\\mathcal{B} = \\{P(t) \\mid t \\in \\mathcal{U}\\} = \\{ P(f^k(c)) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}_0 \\}\n$$\nThe depth of a ground term $t$ is defined as $\\operatorname{depth}(c) = 0$ and $\\operatorname{depth}(f(t')) = 1 + \\operatorname{depth}(t')$. It follows that $\\operatorname{depth}(f^k(c)) = k$.\n\nThe depth-$d$ Herbrand expansion, denoted $H_d$, is the set of all ground instances of the clauses in $S$ where every term involved has a depth of at most $d$.\nLet's analyze the clauses required for a refutation. The intuitive contradiction arises from deriving $P(f^n(c))$ and confronting it with an instance of $\\neg P(f^n(z))$.\n\n- The clause $\\{P(c)\\}$ is ground, and the term $c$ has depth $0$. It is in $H_d$ for any $d \\ge 0$.\n- Ground instances of $\\{\\neg P(y), P(f(y))\\}$ are formed by substituting $y$ with a ground term $t=f^k(c) \\in \\mathcal{U}$. This gives $\\{\\neg P(f^k(c)), P(f^{k+1}(c))\\}$. The depths of the terms are $k$ and $k+1$. For this clause to be in $H_d$, we need $\\operatorname{depth}(f^{k+1}(c)) = k+1 \\le d$, which implies $k \\le d-1$.\n- Ground instances of $\\{\\neg P(f^{n}(z))\\}$ are formed by substituting $z$ with $t=f^k(c) \\in \\mathcal{U}$. This gives $\\{\\neg P(f^n(f^k(c)))\\} = \\{\\neg P(f^{n+k}(c))\\}$. The depth of the term is $n+k$. For this clause to be in $H_d$, we need $n+k \\le d$, which implies $k \\le d-n$.\n\nTo obtain a contradiction, we need to derive the empty clause. A resolution proof would proceed as follows:\n1. From $\\{P(c)\\}$ and $\\{\\neg P(c), P(f(c))\\}$, derive $\\{P(f(c))\\}$.\n2. From $\\{P(f(c))\\}$ and $\\{\\neg P(f(c)), P(f^2(c))\\}$, derive $\\{P(f^2(c))\\}$.\n...\n$n$. By chaining these resolutions $n$ times, from $\\{P(f^{n-1}(c))\\}$ and $\\{\\neg P(f^{n-1}(c)), P(f^n(c))\\}$, we derive $\\{P(f^n(c))\\}$.\n$n+1$. This derived clause $\\{P(f^n(c))\\}$ can then be resolved with a negative clause like $\\{\\neg P(f^n(c))\\}$ to produce the empty clause.\n\nLet's check the depth requirements for this derivation.\n- To derive $\\{P(f^n(c))\\}$ via the chain resolution, we need all ground instances of the second clause, $\\{\\neg P(f^k(c)), P(f^{k+1}(c))\\}$, for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$. The last instance in this chain, for $k=n-1$, involves the term $f^n(c)$, which has depth $n$. Therefore, we need $d \\ge n$.\n- To obtain the contradicting negative clause, we can instantiate $\\{\\neg P(f^n(z))\\}$ with $z=c$. This yields $\\{\\neg P(f^n(c))\\}$. The term $f^n(c)$ has depth $n$. So, to have this clause in our ground set, we need $d \\ge n$.\n\nBoth essential components for the refutation require a depth of at least $n$. This suggests that the minimal depth is $d_{\\min}(n) = n$.\n\nLet's verify this.\nIf $d=n$, the depth-$n$ expansion $H_n$ contains:\n- $\\{P(c)\\}$.\n- $\\{\\neg P(f^k(c)), P(f^{k+1}(c))\\}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n- $\\{\\neg P(f^{n+k}(c))\\}$ for $k=0$, which is the single clause $\\{\\neg P(f^n(c))\\}$.\nThis set is unsatisfiable, as will be demonstrated by the refutation in the next section. Thus, a depth of $n$ is sufficient.\n\nNow consider a depth of $d=n-1$. The expansion $H_{n-1}$ contains:\n- $\\{P(c)\\}$.\n- $\\{\\neg P(f^k(c)), P(f^{k+1}(c))\\}$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-2$.\n- For the third clause type, we need $n+k \\le n-1$, which means $k \\le -1$. Since $k$ must be a non-negative integer, there are no ground instances of $\\{\\neg P(f^n(z))\\}$ in $H_{n-1}$.\n\nThe resulting set of clauses is $H_{n-1} = \\{ \\{P(c)\\} \\} \\cup \\{ \\{\\neg P(f^k(c)), P(f^{k+1}(c))\\} \\mid k=0, \\dots, n-2 \\}$.\nThis set is satisfiable. Consider the propositional interpretation $I$ where $P(f^i(c))$ is true for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}$, and false for all other ground atoms.\n- The clause $\\{P(c)\\}$ is satisfied because $I(P(c))$ is true.\n- The clauses $\\{\\neg P(f^k(c)), P(f^{k+1}(c))\\}$ for $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-2\\}$ are satisfied because $I(P(f^{k+1}(c)))$ is true (since $k+1 \\le n-1$).\nSince the Herbrand expansion $H_{n-1}$ is satisfiable, no refutation can be derived from it.\nTherefore, a depth of $d=n-1$ is insufficient.\n\nThe minimal depth is $d_{\\min}(n) = n$.\n\n**4. Resolution Refutation and Minimality Verification**\n\nUsing ground instances whose terms have depth at most $d_{\\min}(n)=n$, we can construct a resolution refutation. Let $R(A, B)$ denote the resolvent of clauses $A$ and $B$.\nLet $C_1 = \\{P(c)\\}$, $C_{2,k} = \\{\\neg P(f^k(c)), P(f^{k+1}(c))\\}$, and $C_{3,0} = \\{\\neg P(f^n(c))\\}$. All these clauses are in $H_n$.\n\n1. $R_0 = C_1 = \\{P(c)\\}$ (Given in $H_n$)\n2. $R_1 = R(R_0, C_{2,0}) = R(\\{P(c)\\}, \\{\\neg P(c), P(f(c))\\}) = \\{P(f(c))\\}$\n3. $R_2 = R(R_1, C_{2,1}) = R(\\{P(f(c))\\}, \\{\\neg P(f(c)), P(f^2(c))\\}) = \\{P(f^2(c))\\}$\n...\n$k+1$. $R_k = R(R_{k-1}, C_{2,k-1}) = \\{P(f^k(c))\\}$ for $k=1, \\dots, n$.\n\nThis process is an induction. Let $R_{k-1} = \\{P(f^{k-1}(c))\\}$. We resolve it with $C_{2,k-1} = \\{\\neg P(f^{k-1}(c)), P(f^k(c))\\}$, which is in $H_n$ because $k-1 \\le n-1$. The resolvent is $R_k = \\{P(f^k(c))\\}$. Starting with $R_0=\\{P(c)\\}$, we can derive $R_n=\\{P(f^n(c))\\}$ after $n$ resolution steps.\n\nThe final step of the refutation is:\n$n+1$. $R(R_n, C_{3,0}) = R(\\{P(f^n(c))\\}, \\{\\neg P(f^n(c))\\}) = \\square$ (the empty clause).\n\nThis completes the refutation.\n\nThe minimality of the depth $d_{\\min}(n)=n$ was established previously. Any smaller depth, such as $n-1$, results in a set of ground clauses $H_{n-1}$ that does not contain any negative unit clauses (like $\\{\\neg P(t)\\}$). As shown, $H_{n-1}$ is satisfiable. By the soundness of resolution, a satisfiable set of clauses cannot produce a refutation (the empty clause). Therefore, $d_{\\min}(n)$ must be at least $n$. Since a depth of $n$ is sufficient, it is minimal.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form expression for $d_{\\min}(n)$.\nBased on the analysis, $d_{\\min}(n) = n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n}\n$$", "id": "2978926"}]}
