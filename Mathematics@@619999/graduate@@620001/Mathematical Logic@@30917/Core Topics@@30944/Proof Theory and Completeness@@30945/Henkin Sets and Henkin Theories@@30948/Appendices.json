This practice challenges you to explore the 'why' behind this rule. By analyzing a series of scenarios, you will see precisely how reusing a single witness for different claims can catastrophically introduce a contradiction into an otherwise consistent theory, demonstrating the logical necessity of fresh witnesses. [@problem_id:2973963]", "problem": "Consider a language of First-Order Logic (FOL) with equality, and recall the core Henkin idea: in extending a consistent theory to a Henkin set, for every existential sentence $\\exists x\\,\\varphi(x)$ one adds a new constant symbol $c_{\\varphi}$ and the corresponding witness axiom $\\varphi(c_{\\varphi})$, maintaining syntactic consistency. A theory $T$ is syntactically consistent if there is no sentence $\\sigma$ such that both $\\sigma$ and its negation $\\neg\\sigma$ are derivable in $T$. A Henkin set requires, among other things, that for each existential sentence $\\exists x\\,\\varphi(x)$ in the set, there is a dedicated constant $c_{\\varphi}$ appearing only as the witness for $\\varphi$.\n\nYour task is to identify which option gives a scientifically sound example where reusing the same constant symbol for two different witness axioms forces inconsistency, and to explain the precise logical clash. All options below are formulated in the same signature of First-Order Logic (FOL) with equality and use standard axioms of equality (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and substitutivity of equals).\n\nChoose the correct option.\n\nA. Let the language have two unary predicate symbols $P$ and $Q$. Let $T_{0}$ be the base theory containing the axiom $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\rightarrow\\neg Q(x))$, together with the two existential sentences $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ and $\\exists x\\,Q(x)$. In a Henkin-style extension, if one mistakenly uses the same constant $c$ as a witness for both existential sentences, adding $P(c)$ and $Q(c)$, then from $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\rightarrow\\neg Q(x))$ and $P(c)$ one derives $\\neg Q(c)$, which directly contradicts $Q(c)$. Thus the reuse of $c$ for two different witness axioms yields inconsistency by violating the disjointness enforced by $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\rightarrow\\neg Q(x))$.\n\nB. Let the language have a unary predicate $R$. Suppose the base theory contains the single existential sentence $\\exists x\\,R(x)$ (listed twice). Reusing a constant $c$ to witness both instances adds $R(c)$ and $R(c)$, which is harmless duplication. No axiom forces a contradiction, so no inconsistency arises from the reuse in this case.\n\nC. Let the language have a binary relation $<$, and let the base theory contain the irreflexivity axiom $\\forall x\\,\\neg(x<x)$. Suppose the theory also contains both existential sentences $\\exists x\\,(x<x)$ and $\\exists x\\,\\neg(x<x)$. Reusing a constant $c$ to witness both yields $(c<c)$ and $\\neg(c<c)$, which is inconsistent. However, the inconsistency is already present before reuse, since $\\exists x\\,(x<x)$ contradicts $\\forall x\\,\\neg(x<x)$ outright; the reuse of a constant is not the source of the clash.\n\nD. Let the language have a unary function symbol $f$ and constants $a$ and $b$. Suppose the base theory contains the existential sentences $\\exists y\\,(f(y)=a)$ and $\\exists y\\,(f(y)=b)$, and there is no axiom asserting $a\\neq b$. Reusing the same constant $c$ for both witness axioms yields $f(c)=a$ and $f(c)=b$, from which one can derive $a=b$ by equality axioms, but this does not force inconsistency because models may interpret $a$ and $b$ as the same element. Therefore, reuse in this scenario does not by itself create a contradiction.\n\nWhich option correctly illustrates that reusing one constant for two different witness axioms can lead to inconsistency and correctly explains the specific clash?\n\nA. The disjointness axiom $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\rightarrow\\neg Q(x))$ ensures that $P$ and $Q$ cannot hold simultaneously at the reused constant $c$, making $P(c)$ and $Q(c)$ inconsistent.\nB. Reusing the constant for two identical existential sentences merely duplicates the same witness instance and remains consistent.\nC. The theory is already inconsistent due to $\\exists x\\,(x<x)$ contradicting irreflexivity, and reuse is irrelevant to the clash.\nD.

The initial base theory $T_0$ must be syntactically consistent. This can be demonstrated by showing that it has a model (Model Existence Theorem).\n2.  The base theory $T_0$ must contain at least two distinct existential sentences, say $\\exists x\\,\\varphi(x)$ and $\\exists x\\,\\psi(x)$.\n3.  The extended theory $T' = T_0 \\cup \\{\\varphi(c), \\psi(c)\\}$, formed by adding witness axioms for both existential sentences using the same constant $c$, must be syntactically inconsistent.

The explanation provided in the option for this inconsistency must be logically correct and precise.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\n*   **Base Theory ($T_A$):** The theory consists of the sentences $\\{\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\rightarrow\\neg Q(x)), \\exists x\\,P(x), \\exists x\\,Q(x)\\}$. The language includes two unary predicates, $P$ and $Q$.\n*   **Consistency of $T_A$:** The theory $T_A$ is consistent. We can construct a model. Let the domain of interpretation be $D = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$. Let the interpretation of the predicate symbols be $P^I = \\{d_1\\}$ and $Q^I = \\{d_2\\}$.\n    *   The axiom $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\rightarrow\\neg Q(x))$ is satisfied:\n        *   For $x=d_1$: $P(d_1) \\rightarrow \\neg Q(d_1)$ evaluates to $\\text{True} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{False}$, which is True.\n        *   For $x=d_2$: $P(d_2) \\rightarrow \\neg Q(d_2)$ evaluates to $\\text{False} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{True}$, which is True.\n    *   The axiom $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ is satisfied because $P(d_1)$ is true.\n    *   The axiom $\\exists x\\,Q(x)$ is satisfied because $Q(d_2)$ is true.\n    Since a model exists, the theory $T_A$ is consistent.\n*   **Henkin Extension with Reuse:** The two distinct existential sentences are $\\exists x\\,P(x)$ and $\\exists x\\,Q(x)$. We reuse the constant $c$ to witness both, creating the extended theory $T_A' = T_A \\cup \\{P(c), Q(c)\\}$.\n*   **Inconsistency of $T_A'$:** We can derive a contradiction from $T_A'$.\n    1.  From $T_A$, we have the axiom $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\rightarrow\\neg Q(x))$.\n    2.  By Universal Instantiation with the constant $c$, we derive $P(c)\\rightarrow\\neg Q(c)$.\n    3.  From the extension, we have the axiom $P(c)$.\n    4.  By Modus Ponens on steps $2$ and $3$, we derive $\\neg Q(c)$.\n    5.  From the extension, we also have the axiom $Q(c)$.\n    6.  Steps $4$ and $5$ give us $Q(c) \\land \\neg Q(c)$, which is a formal contradiction. Thus, the theory $T_A'$ is inconsistent.\n*   **Conclusion:** Option A starts with a consistent theory. The reuse of the constant $c$ for two different witness axioms, $P(c)$ and $Q(c)$, directly leads to an inconsistency. The explanation provided in the option is a precise and correct account of this logical clash. Therefore, this option correctly illustrates the required phenomenon.\n\n**Verdict for Option A: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\n*   **Scenario:** The base theory contains $\\exists x\\,R(x)$ listed twice. Reusing a constant $c$ adds $R(c)$ and $R(c)$.\n*   **Analysis:** The two existential sentences are not distinct; they are identical. The Henkin rule, which requires a *new* constant for *each* existential formula to be witnessed, is not truly tested here in the way the problem intends. The resulting theory is simply $\\{\\exists x\\,R(x), R(c)\\}$, which is obviously consistent. The option correctly states that no inconsistency arises. However, the task is to find an option that *does* illustrate how inconsistency *can* arise from reusing a constant for *different* witness axioms. This option illustrates a scenario where it does not, so it does not fulfill the prompt's request.\n\n**Verdict for Option B: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\n*   **Base Theory ($T_C$):** The theory contains $\\{\\forall x\\,\\neg(x<x), \\exists x\\,(x<x), \\dots\\}$.\n*   **Consistency of $T_C$:** The base theory is inconsistent from the outset. The axiom $\\forall x\\,\\neg(x<x)$ is logically equivalent to $\\neg\\exists x\\,(x<x)$. The theory thus contains a sentence $\\exists x\\,(x<x)$ and its negation $\\neg\\exists x\\,(x<x)$. A theory containing a sentence and its negation is inconsistent.\n*   **Analysis:** The problem with this scenario is that the inconsistency is present *before* the Henkin-style step of adding a witness. The reuse of the constant $c$ to add $(c<c)$ and $\\neg(c<c)$ merely makes the contradiction more explicit at the ground level, but it is not the *source* of the inconsistency. The core requirement is that a *consistent* theory becomes inconsistent due to the reuse. This option fails that primary condition. The explanation within the option itself correctly identifies this flaw.\n\n**Verdict for Option C: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n*   **Base Theory ($T_D$):** The theory contains $\\{\\exists y\\,(f(y)=a), \\exists y\\,(f(y)=b)\\}$.\n*   **Consistency of $T_D$:** This theory is consistent. A model can have a domain $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$, with $a$ interpreted as $d_1$, $b$ as $d_1$, and $f$ as a function mapping $d_2$ to $d_1$.\n*   **Henkin Extension with Reuse:** The extended theory is $T_D' = T_D \\cup \\{f(c)=a, f(c)=b\\}$.\n*   **Inconsistency of $T_D'$:** From the axioms $f(c)=a$ and $f(c)=b$, we can use symmetry and transitivity of equality to derive $a=b$. However, deriving $a=b$ does not create an inconsistency by itself. An inconsistency would only arise if the base theory $T_D$ also contained the axiom $a \\neq b$. Since it does not, the theory $T_D'$ is perfectly consistent; it just has a smaller class of models than $T_D$ (only those where $a$ and $b$ are interpreted as the same element). The option correctly concludes that this reuse does not force inconsistency. Therefore, it does not provide the example of inconsistency requested by the prompt.\n\n**Verdict for Option D: Incorrect**\n\n**Summary**\n\nOnly Option A presents a scenario where a demonstrably consistent base theory becomes inconsistent precisely because of the reuse of a single constant as a witness for two different existential sentences. The explanation provided is logically sound and accurately pinpoints the contradiction. Options B, C, and D fail because they either do not generate an inconsistency, start with an already inconsistent theory, or do not concern distinct existential sentences in the intended manner.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2973963"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of Henkin's proof is the construction of a model's domain directly from the syntactic material of the theory itself—its closed terms.

Counting the number of distinct equivalence classes.\n\n**Justification of $H \\vdash t_{1} = t_{2}$**\n\nThe terms $t_{1} \\coloneqq f(f(f(a)))$ and $t_{2} \\coloneqq f(a)$ are syntactically distinct, as they are different sequences of symbols. We must show that they are provably equal in the theory $T_{0}$, and therefore also in its extension $H$.\n\nThe single non-logical, non-equality axiom in $T_{0}$ is $\\forall x\\, f(f(x)) = f(x)$.\nWe use universal instantiation, a fundamental rule of inference in first-order logic.\n\nFirst, let's instantiate the axiom by substituting the term $f(a)$ for the variable $x$. This is a valid substitution since $f(a)$ is a term.\nThis yields the statement:\n$$T_{0} \\vdash f(f(f(a))) = f(f(a))$$\nBy definition, $t_{1}$ is $f(f(f(a)))$, so we have:\n$$T_{0} \\vdash t_{1} = f(f(a)) \\quad (*)$$\n\nNext, let's instantiate the axiom by substituting the constant symbol $a$ for the variable $x$.\nThis yields the statement:\n$$T_{0} \\vdash f(f(a)) = f(a)$$\nBy definition, $t_{2}$ is $f(a)$, so we have:\n$$T_{0} \\vdash f(f(a)) = t_{2} \\quad (**)$$\n\nThe axioms of equality, which are part of $T_{0}$, include the axiom of transitivity for equality: $\\forall y \\forall z \\forall w ((y=z \\land z=w) \\rightarrow y=w)$. Applying this rule to the provable statements $(*)$ and $(**)$, we have:\nFrom $T_{0} \\vdash t_{1} = f(f(a))$ and $T_{0} \\vdash f(f(a)) = t_{2}$, it follows that\n$$T_{0} \\vdash t_{1} = t_{2}$$\nSince $H$ is an extension of $T_{0}$, any theorem of $T_{0}$ is also a theorem of $H$. Therefore, $H \\vdash t_{1} = t_{2}$. This confirms that $t_{1}$ and $t_{2}$ belong to the same equivalence class in the term model $\\mathfrak{M}_{H}$, i.e., $[t_{1}]_{\\equiv_{H}} = [t_{2}]_{\\equiv_{H}}$.\n\n**Characterization of Equivalence Classes**\n\nThe closed $\\mathcal{L}$-terms are those that can be constructed from the constant symbol $a$ and the function symbol $f$. These are precisely the terms in the set $\\{f^{n}(a) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}, n \\ge 0\\}$, which is $\\{a, f(a), f(f(a)), \\dots\\}$. We need to determine how these terms are partitioned by the relation $\\equiv_{H}$.\n\nLet $n$ be an integer such that $n \\ge 1$. Consider the term $f^{n}(a)$.\nAs shown above with $x=a$, we have $H \\vdash f(f(a)) = f(a)$, which means $f^{2}(a) \\equiv_{H} f^{1}(a)$.\n\nFor any integer $k \\ge 2$, let the term $s$ be $f^{k-2}(a)$. Instantiating the axiom $\\forall x\\, f(f(x))=f(x)$ with $x=s$ gives:\n$H \\vdash f(f(f^{k-2}(a))) = f(f^{k-2}(a))$, which is $H \\vdash f^{k}(a) = f^{k-1}(a)$.\nThis holds for all $k \\ge 2$. By repeated application of transitivity, we have:\n$$H \\vdash f^{n}(a) = f^{n-1}(a) = \\dots = f^{2}(a)$$\nAnd since $H \\vdash f^{2}(a) = f^{1}(a) = f(a)$, we conclude that for any integer $n \\ge 1$:\n$$H \\vdash f^{n}(a) = f(a)$$\nThis means that all terms in the set $\\{f(a), f(f(a)), f(f(f(a))), \\dots\\}$ are equivalent to each other under $\\equiv_{H}$ and thus belong to a single equivalence class, which can be represented by $[f(a)]_{\\equiv_{H}}$.\n\nThe only remaining closed $\\mathcal{L}$-term to consider is $a$ itself, which is $f^{0}(a)$. We must determine if $a$ is equivalent to $f(a)$, i.e., if $H \\vdash a=f(a)$.\n\nTo prove that $H \\not\\vdash a=f(a)$, by the Soundness Theorem for first-order logic, it suffices to construct a model of the theory $H$ in which the sentence $a=f(a)$ is false.\n\nA fundamental property of the Henkin construction is that any model of the original theory $T_{0}$ can be expanded into a model of the Henkin extension $H$. So, our task reduces to finding a model of $T_{0}$ where $a=f(a)$ is false.\n\nLet us construct such a model $\\mathfrak{M}$ for $T_{0}$.\nLet the domain of the model be the set $D = \\{0, 1\\}$.\nLet the interpretation of the constant symbol $a$ be $a^{\\mathfrak{M}} = 0$.\nLet the interpretation of the function symbol $f$ be a function $f^{\\mathfrak{M}}: D \\to D$ defined by:\n$f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(0) = 1$\n$f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(1) = 1$\n\nWe first verify that $\\mathfrak{M}$ is a model of $T_{0}$ by checking its axiom $\\forall x\\, f(f(x))=f(x)$.\n- For $x=0$: $f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(0)) = f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(1) = 1$. The right side is $f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(0)=1$. Since $1=1$, the axiom holds.\n- For $x=1$: $f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(1)) = f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(1) = 1$. The right side is $f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(1)=1$. Since $1=1$, the axiom holds.\nThus, $\\mathfrak{M}$ is a model of $T_{0}$.\n\nNow, we check the truth of the sentence $a=f(a)$ in this model.\nThe interpretation of the term $a$ is $a^{\\mathfrak{M}} = 0$.\nThe interpretation of the term $f(a)$ is $f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(a^{\\mathfrak{M}}) = f^{\\mathfrak{M}}(0) = 1$.\nSince $0 \\neq 1$ in the standard integers used for the domain, the sentence $a=f(a)$ is false in $\\mathfrak{M}$.\n\nBecause there exists a model of $T_{0}$ in which $a=f(a)$ is false, we can conclude that $T_{0} \\not\\vdash a=f(a)$.\n\nNow we must show this implies $H \\not\\vdash a=f(a)$. We can expand the model $\\mathfrak{M}$ of $T_{0}$ to a model $\\mathfrak{M}'$ of $H$. $\\mathfrak{M}'$ has the same domain $D$ and the same interpretations for $a$ and $f$. For each new Henkin constant $c_{\\varphi}$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}_{H}$, we must define its interpretation $(c_{\\varphi})^{\\mathfrak{M}'}$. For each Henkin axiom $\\exists x\\, \\varphi(x) \\rightarrow \\varphi(c_{\\varphi})$:\n- If $\\mathfrak{M} \\models \\neg \\exists x\\, \\varphi(x)$, the implication is true regardless of the interpretation of $c_{\\varphi}$. We can assign $(c_{\\varphi})^{\\mathfrak{M}'} = 0$.\n- If $\\mathfrak{M} \\models \\exists x\\, \\varphi(x)$, then there must exist an element $d \\in D$ such that $\\mathfrak{M} \\models \\varphi(d)$. We define $(c_{\\varphi})^{\\mathfrak{M}'} = d$. Then $\\mathfrak{M}' \\models \\varphi(c_{\\varphi})$ and the implication is true.\n(This simultaneous choice of witnesses requires the Axiom of Choice meta-theoretically).\nThis construction shows that $\\mathfrak{M}$ can be expanded to a model $\\mathfrak{M}'$ of $H$. In this model $\\mathfrak{M}'$, the interpretations of $a$ and $f$ are the same as in $\\mathfrak{M}$, so the sentence $a=f(a)$ is still false. Since there exists a model of $H$ where $a=f(a)$ is false, we conclude by soundness that $H \\not\\vdash a=f(a)$.\n\nTherefore, $a \\not\\equiv_{H} f(a)$, and the equivalence class $[a]_{\\equiv_{H}}$ is distinct from $[f(a)]_{\\equiv_{H}}$.\n\n**Conclusion on the Number of Classes**\n\nThe set of all closed $\\mathcal{L}$-terms of the form $f^{n}(a)$ is $\\{a, f(a), f^2(a), \\dots\\}$.

For the disjunction $t=a \\lor t=f(a)$, this means $H$ must prove one of the disjuncts. That is, for any closed term $t$, either $H \\vdash t=a$ or $H \\vdash t=f(a)$.\n\nThis implies that every equivalence class $[t]$ in the domain $D^{\\mathcal{M}_H}$ is equal to either the equivalence class $[a]$ or the equivalence class $[f(a)]$. Thus, the domain can have at most two elements: $D^{\\mathcal{M}_H} = \\{[a], [f(a)]\\}$.\n\nTo find the exact cardinality, we must determine if $[a]$ and $[f(a)]$ are distinct. They are distinct if and only if $H \\not\\vdash a=f(a)$. Since $H$ is consistent, it cannot prove a contradiction. Let's assume for the sake of contradiction that $H \\vdash a=f(a)$.\n- We have $P(a)$ as an axiom in $H$ (Axiom 2).\n- If $H \\vdash a=f(a)$, then by the rule of substitution of equals, we can substitute $a$ for $f(a)$ in any provable statement.\n- The axiom $\\neg P(f(a))$ is in $H$ (Axiom 3). Substituting $a$ for $f(a)$ in this axiom would yield $H \\vdash \\neg P(a)$.\n- This would mean that $H$ proves both $P(a)$ and $\\neg P(a)$. This is a contradiction.\n- Since we are given that $H$ is a consistent theory, our assumption must be false. Therefore, $H \\not\\vdash a=f(a)$.\n\nSince $a$ and $f(a)$ are not provably equal, their equivalence classes $[a]$ and $[f(a)]$ are distinct elements of the domain.\nThus, the domain $D^{\\mathcal{M}_H}$ consists of exactly two distinct elements.\n$$ \\lvert D^{\\mathcal{M}_H}\\rvert = 2 $$\n\n**Determining the Cardinality of the Predicate Interpretation, $\\lvert P^{\\mathcal{M}_H}\\rvert$**\n\nThe interpretation of the predicate $P$ in the canonical model, $P^{\\mathcal{M}_H}$, is defined as the set of elements in the domain for which $P$ holds. Formally:\n$$ P^{\\mathcal{M}_H} = \\{ [t] \\in D^{\\mathcal{M}_H} \\mid H \\vdash P(t) \\} $$\nWe have established that $D^{\\mathcal{M}_H} = \\{[a], [f(a)]\\}$. We need to check for each of these two elements if they belong to $P^{\\mathcal{M}_H}$.\n\n1.  **Check for $[a]$**: Does $[a] \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}_H}$? This is true if and only if $H \\vdash P(a)$. Axiom (2) of the theory $T$ is precisely $P(a)$. Since $H$ is an extension of $T$, $P(a)$ is an axiom of $H$, and therefore $H \\vdash P(a)$. Thus, $[a] \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}_H}$.\n\n2.  **Check for $[f(a)]**: Does $[f(a)] \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}_H}$? This is true if and only if $H \\vdash P(f(a))$. Axiom (3) of the theory $T$ is $\\neg P(f(a))$. Since this axiom is in $H$, we have $H \\vdash \\neg P(f(a))$. Because $H$ is consistent, it cannot be the case that $H$ also proves $P(f(a))$. Therefore, $H \\not\\vdash P(f(a))$. Thus, $[f(a)] \\notin P^{\\mathcal{M}_H}$.\n\nThe set $P^{\\mathcal{M}_H}$ contains the element $[a]$ but not the element $[f(a)]$. Therefore, it contains exactly one element.\n$$ \\lvert P^{\\mathcal{M}_H}\\rvert = 1 $$\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe cardinality of the domain is 2, and the cardinality of the interpretation of the predicate $P$ is 1.
