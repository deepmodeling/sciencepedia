This hinges on the correct arithmetization of the predicate $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$, which stands for \"$y$ is the code of a $T$-proof of the formula with Gödel number $x$\".\n\nA formal proof in a Hilbert-style system is a finite sequence of formulas where each formula is either an axiom or is derived from previous formulas by rules of inference (in this case, modus ponens). A formula $\\phi$ is considered proven by such a sequence if and only if $\\phi$ is the **last** formula in the sequence.\n\nThe definition of $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ is standardly given by $\\exists y \\, \\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$. According to the arithmetical hierarchy, for $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ to be a $\\Sigma_1$ formula, its matrix, $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$, must be a $\\Delta_0$ formula (a formula where all quantifiers are bounded).\n\nThe formula $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$ must assert two conditions:\n1.  $y$ encodes a valid $T$-proof. This is given by the predicate $\\mathrm{Prf}_T(y)$. The problem states that $\\mathrm{Prf}_T(y)$ is a primitive recursive predicate. A fundamental theorem of computability theory, provable in weak arithmetic such as $I\\Sigma_1$, states that every primitive recursive predicate is definable by a $\\Delta_0$ formula.\n2.  The formula with Gödel number $x$ is the conclusion of the proof encoded by $y$. As established, this means $x$ must be the Gödel number of the last formula in the sequence encoded by $y$.\n\nLet us construct the formula for the second condition. The problem provides a standard Gödel coding apparatus for finite sequences with primitive recursive functions $\\mathrm{len}(y)$ and $\\mathrm{entry}(y,i)$, whose graphs are definable by $\\Delta_0$ formulas. A sequence is non-empty if its length is greater than $0$. The indices of a sequence of length $L$ run from $0$ to $L-1$. Therefore, the last entry is at index $\\mathrm{len}(y)-1$.\nThe assertion \"$p$ is the last line of the proof coded by $y$\" is formalized as: \"$y$ codes a non-empty sequence of formulas, and $p$ is the entry at index $\\mathrm{len}(y)-1$\".\nIn formal notation, this is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Last}(y,p) \\equiv \\mathrm{Seq}(y) \\land \\mathrm{len}(y) > 0 \\land p = \\mathrm{entry}(y, \\mathrm{len}(y)-1) $$\nHere, $\\mathrm{Seq}(y)$ is a predicate (assumed $\\Delta_0$) checking if $y$ is a valid code for a sequence. The relations $l = \\mathrm{len}(y)$ and $e = \\mathrm{entry}(y,i)$ are $\\Delta_0$. Basic arithmetic operations and comparisons, like $k = l-1$ and $l>0$, are also $\\Delta_0$. Since all components and operations are $\\Delta_0$, the composite formula $\\mathrm{Last}(y,p)$ is a $\\Delta_0$ formula.\n\nNow, we can define $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$ as the conjunction of the two conditions:\n$$ \\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x) \\equiv \\mathrm{Prf}_T(y) \\land \\mathrm{Last}(y,x) $$\nSince both $\\mathrm{Prf}_T(y)$ and $\\mathrm{Last}(y,x)$ are $\\Delta_0$ formulas, their conjunction, $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x)$, is also a $\\Delta_0$ formula.\n\nFinally, the provability predicate is defined as:\n$$ \\mathrm{Prov}_T(x) \\equiv \\exists y \\, \\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x) $$\nThis is an existential quantification of a $\\Delta_0$ formula, which by definition is a $\\Sigma_1$ formula. This standard construction is precisely what is needed to prove the Hilbert-Bernays-Löb derivability conditions, particularly the third condition, $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner) \\to \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner) \\urcorner)$, whose proof relies on the $\\Sigma_1$-completeness property for the $\\Sigma_1$ formula $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner)$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on this derivation.\n\n**A.

This structure is essential for proving the derivability conditions.\n*   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Define the “last line” relation by... the maximum Gödel number...**\nThis option proposes defining the last line as the formula with the maximum Gödel number in the proof. This is conceptually incorrect. The conclusion of a proof is determined by its position in the deductive sequence, not the numerical value of its code. This option also proposes defining $\\mathrm{Proof}_T(y,x) \\equiv \\mathrm{Prf}_T(y) \\wedge x \\in y$, which means $x$ simply appears anywhere in the proof. This is also incorrect; a formula appearing in a proof is not necessarily a theorem proven by that proof. It could be an axiom, a hypothesis in a sub-derivation, or an intermediate lemma.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The “last line” property cannot be expressed by a bounded ($\\Delta_0$) formula...**\nThis option claims that formalizing the \"last line\" property requires a $\\Pi_2$ condition. This is false. As demonstrated in the analysis of option A, the property is definable by a $\\Delta_0$ formula. The idea of quantifying over all extensions of the sequence is irrelevant to identifying the last element of a given, fixed sequence $y$. Furthermore, it claims that this higher complexity is necessary for the derivability conditions, which is the opposite of the truth. The standard proofs require $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(x)$ to be $\\Sigma_1$. A more complex predicate would invalidate the usual proof of the third derivability condition.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Define the “last line” relation by... $p$ is some line of the proof...**\nThis option defines the relation as $\\exists i<\\mathrm{len}(y)\\,\\big(p=\\mathrm{entry}(y,i)\\big)$, meaning $p$ is any formula appearing in the proof sequence. This is the same conceptual error as in option B. While this would lead to a $\\Sigma_1$ provability predicate, the predicate would not represent the correct notion of theoremhood. A formula being provable means there exists a proof that concludes with it, not a proof that merely contains it. This faulty definition would not satisfy the derivability conditions; for instance, the formalization of modus ponens (D2) would fail.\n*   **Verdict:** Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2971586"}, {"introduction": "The Hilbert-Bernays-Löb derivability conditions serve as a crucial bridge between reasoning *within* an arithmetical theory $T$ and reasoning *about* it using the abstract framework of provability logic, $\\mathsf{GL}$.

The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The tasks are specified with sufficient precision to admit a unique and verifiable solution path. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution will be presented in three parts, corresponding to the three tasks.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation in $GL$\n\nThe goal is to provide a finite derivation of the modal formula $\\Box p \\to \\Box(q \\to p)$ in the logic $GL$. The rules of inference available are modus ponens (from $\\varphi$ and $\\varphi \\to \\psi$, infer $\\psi$) and necessitation (from $\\vdash \\varphi$, infer $\\vdash \\Box \\varphi$). The axioms include all propositional tautologies, axiom $K: \\Box(\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to (\\Box \\varphi \\to \\Box \\psi)$, and Löb's axiom $L: \\Box(\\Box \\varphi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\Box \\varphi$.\n\nThe target formula, $\\Box p \\to \\Box(q \\to p)$, is a theorem of the logic $K$, which is a sub-logic of $GL$. Therefore, we do not need to use Löb's axiom. The derivation is as follows:\n\n1.  $p \\to (q \\to p)$\n    This is an instance of a propositional tautology, so it is an axiom in $GL$.\n\n2.  $\\Box(p \\to (q \\to p))$\n    This follows from line (1) by the rule of Necessitation. Since $p \\to (q \\to p)$ is a theorem, $\\Box(p \\to (q \\to p))$ is also a theorem.\n\n3.  $\\Box(p \\to (q \\to p)) \\to (\\Box p \\to \\Box(q \\to p))$\n    This is an instance of the axiom schema $K$, i.e., $\\Box(A \\to B) \\to (\\Box A \\to \\Box B)$, with the substitution $A := p$ and $B := q \\to p$.\n\n4.  $\\Box p \\to \\Box(q \\to p)$\n    This follows from lines (2) and (3) by Modus Ponens.\n\nThis completes the derivation of the formula in $GL$.\n\n### Part 2: Arithmetical Translation into a $T$-derivation\n\nThe second task is to translate the above derivation into a formal proof within the theory $T$. The interpretation maps $p$ to an arithmetical sentence $\\alpha$, $q$ to a sentence $\\beta$, and $\\Box \\varphi$ to $\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\langle \\varphi \\rangle \\urcorner)$. The final goal is to derive $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\urcorner) \\to \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\beta \\to \\alpha \\urcorner)$. The only tools permitted are the derivability conditions $(D1)$, $(D2)$, $(D3)$, and propositional reasoning within $T$.\n\nWe track the GL derivation step-by-step:\n\n1.  **GL step 1:** The axiom $p \\to (q \\to p)$ is a propositional tautology.\n    **$T$-derivation step 1:** Its translation, $\\alpha \\to (\\beta \\to \\alpha)$, is also a propositional tautology. Since $T$ is an extension of Peano Arithmetic, it proves all instances of propositional tautologies.\n    $$T \\vdash \\alpha \\to (\\beta \\to \\alpha)$$\n    This step does not invoke any of the derivability conditions.\n\n2.  **GL step 2:** The formula $\\Box(p \\to (q \\to p))$ is derived by Necessitation.\n    **$T$-derivation step 2:** The rule of Necessitation corresponds to the derivability condition $(D1)$. Since we have established $T \\vdash \\alpha \\to (\\beta \\to \\alpha)$ in the previous step, we can apply $(D1)$: if $T \\vdash \\varphi$, then $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$.\n    $$T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\to (\\beta \\to \\alpha) \\urcorner)$$\n    This step constitutes one invocation of condition $(D1)$.\n\n3.  **GL step 3:** The formula $\\Box(p \\to (q \\to p)) \\to (\\Box p \\to \\Box(q \\to p))$ is an instance of axiom $K$.\n    **$T$-derivation step 3:** Axiom $K$ corresponds to the derivability condition $(D2)$: $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\to \\psi \\urcorner) \\to (\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\to \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urcorner))$. We use the instance of this schema where $\\varphi$ is the sentence $\\alpha$ and $\\psi$ is the sentence $\\beta \\to \\alpha$. This gives us a theorem of $T$.\n    $$T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\to (\\beta \\to \\alpha) \\urcorner) \\to \\big(\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\urcorner) \\to \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\beta \\to \\alpha \\urcorner)\\big)$$\n    This step constitutes one invocation of condition $(D2)$. Note that condition $(D3)$, which corresponds to the modal axiom $4$ ($\\Box\\varphi \\to \\Box\\Box\\varphi$), is not needed for this derivation.\n\n4.  **GL step 4:** The final formula $\\Box p \\to \\Box(q \\to p)$ is derived by Modus Ponens.\n    **$T$-derivation step 4:** We apply Modus Ponens within the theory $T$. Let $A$ be the sentence $\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\to (\\beta \\to \\alpha) \\urcorner)$ and $B$ be the sentence $\\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\urcorner) \\to \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\beta \\to \\alpha \\urcorner)$. From step 2, we have $T \\vdash A$. From step 3, we have $T \\vdash A \\to B$. By Modus Ponens, we conclude $T \\vdash B$.\n    $$T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\alpha \\urcorner) \\to \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\beta \\to \\alpha \\urcorner)$$\n    This step relies on propositional reasoning within $T$ and does not invoke any of the derivability conditions.\n\n### Part 3: Counting Invocations\n\nThe final task is to compute the ordered triple $(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3})$ representing the number of times conditions $(D1)$, $(D2)$, and $(D3)$ were invoked in the $T$-derivation presented in Part 2.\n\n-   $n_{1}$: Condition $(D1)$ was used exactly once, in step 2 of the $T$-derivation, to internalize the provability of a tautology.\n-   $n_{2}$: Condition $(D2)$ was used exactly once, in step 3 of the $T$-derivation, as the arithmetical counterpart of the modal axiom $K$.\n-   $n_{3}$: Condition $(D3)$, $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\to \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\operatorname{Prov}_{T}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\urcorner)$, was not used at all in the derivation.\n\nThus, the counts are $n_{1} = 1$, $n_{2} = 1$, and $n_{3} = 0$.

The modal atom $\\sigma_t(p)$ is chosen so that, for any modal sentence $G$, we have\n$$\n(\\sigma_t(G))^{*} \\;\\equiv\\; \\text{the arithmetical sentence with Gödel code } \\bigl(t(\\ulcorner G^{*}\\urcorner)\\bigr),\n$$\nhence\n$$\n(\\Box\\,\\sigma_t(G))^{*} \\;\\equiv\\; \\mathrm{Prov}_T\\!\\left(\\ulcorner (\\sigma_t(G))^{*} \\urcorner\\right) \\;\\equiv\\; \\mathrm{Prov}_T\\!\\bigl(t(\\ulcorner G^{*}\\urcorner)\\bigr).\n$$\n\nThat such a $\\sigma_t(p)$ exists follows from standard arithmetization of syntax and the definability of the coding and substitution functions in arithmetic: for each primitive recursive $t$, we can uniformly assign to $p$ a modal formula $\\sigma_t(p)$ whose arithmetical interpretation is the unique sentence with Gödel code equal to $t(\\ulcorner p^{*}\\urcorner)$. The use of arithmetization here is essential.\n\nBy induction on the structure of $\\psi$, it follows that for every modal sentence $G$,\n$$\n(\\tau(\\psi)(G))^{*} \\;\\leftrightarrow\\; \\psi(\\ulcorner G^{*}\\urcorner)\n$$\nis provable in $T$. Indeed, the Boolean steps are immediate by the homomorphic behavior of $(-)^{*}$ on connectives, and the atomic step was arranged by construction of $\\sigma_t(p)$.\n\nNow apply the modal fixed point lemma in $\\mathsf{GL}$ to $A(p):=\\tau(\\psi)(p)$. Since $p$ occurs only inside $\\Box$ in $A$, we obtain a modal sentence $F$ with\n$$\n\\mathsf{GL} \\vdash F \\leftrightarrow A(F) \\;=\\; \\tau(\\psi)(F).\n$$\nBy arithmetical soundness of $\\mathsf{GL}$ under $(-)^{*}$ (which uses the Hilbert–Bernays–Löb derivability conditions in $T$), we infer\n$$\nT \\vdash F^{*} \\leftrightarrow (\\tau(\\psi)(F))^{*}.\n$$\nBy the defining property of $\\tau$,\n$$\nT \\vdash (\\tau(\\psi)(F))^{*} \\leftrightarrow \\psi(\\ulcorner F^{*}\\urcorner).\n$$\nCombining these, we conclude\n$$\nT \\vdash F^{*} \\leftrightarrow \\psi(\\ulcorner F^{*}\\urcorner).\n$$\nSetting $\\theta := F^{*}$ yields precisely the $\\mathrm{Prov}_T$-guarded arithmetical fixed point. This establishes the desired correspondence.\n\nWith this derivation in hand, we evaluate the options.\n\nOption A. This is exactly what we have proved: for any $\\mathrm{Prov}_T$-guarded $\\psi(x)$, there is a sentence $\\theta$ with $T \\vdash \\theta \\leftrightarrow \\psi(\\ulcorner \\theta \\urcorner)$. The construction uses the modalization $\\tau$, the modal fixed point lemma to obtain $F$, and arithmetical soundness to transport $F \\leftrightarrow \\tau(\\psi)(F)$ into $T$, followed by the identification $(\\tau(\\psi)(F))^{*} \\leftrightarrow \\psi(\\ulcorner F^{*}\\urcorner)$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nOption B. The arithmetical soundness of $\\mathsf{GL}$ relative to $T$’s $\\mathrm{Prov}_T$ requires the Hilbert–Bernays–Löb derivability conditions. In particular, the soundness of the Löb axiom $\\Box(\\Box p \\to p) \\to \\Box p$ is nothing but Löb’s theorem, whose proof in $T$ uses these derivability conditions. Without them, one cannot in general conclude from $\\mathsf{GL} \\vdash F \\leftrightarrow A(F)$ that $T \\vdash F^{*} \\leftrightarrow A(F)^{*}$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C. The modal fixed point lemma only guarantees fixed points for modal matrices $A(p)$ where $p$ occurs only under $\\Box$. Consequently, via the $\\tau$-translation, we obtain arithmetical fixed points only for those $\\psi(x)$ in which $x$ occurs only inside $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\cdot)$. Arbitrary unguarded occurrences of $x$ (for example, in atomic arithmetic formulas unrelated to $\\mathrm{Prov}_T$ such as $x=0$ or $x$ appearing in arithmetic terms) cannot be simulated in the purely propositional modal language and so are beyond the scope of this correspondence. The full arithmetical Diagonal Lemma for arbitrary $\\psi(x)$ is a distinct theorem whose proof uses general arithmetization of substitution, not merely the $\\mathsf{GL}$ fixed point. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D. The construction crucially uses arithmetization of syntax: we need primitive recursive coding of formulas, definability of the substitution function, and the ability to identify, for each modal $G$, the code $\\ulcorner G^{*}\\urcorner$ that appears as the argument of $\\mathrm{Prov}_T$. Moreover, the very definition of $\\mathrm{Prov}_T$ is an arithmetization of the proof predicate of $T$. Thus arithmetization is indispensable. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption E. In transporting $\\mathsf{GL} \\vdash F \\leftrightarrow A(F)$ to $T \\vdash F^{*} \\leftrightarrow A(F)^{*}$, only arithmetical soundness of $\\mathsf{GL}$ for $\\mathrm{Prov}_T$ is used. This soundness follows from the Hilbert–Bernays–Löb derivability conditions and does not require Solovay’s arithmetical completeness (which is the converse direction: if a modal formula is valid under all arithmetical interpretations arising from suitable $T$, then it is provable in $\\mathsf{GL}$). Therefore, Solovay completeness is not needed to obtain the fixed point correspondence. Verdict: Correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2971593"}]}
