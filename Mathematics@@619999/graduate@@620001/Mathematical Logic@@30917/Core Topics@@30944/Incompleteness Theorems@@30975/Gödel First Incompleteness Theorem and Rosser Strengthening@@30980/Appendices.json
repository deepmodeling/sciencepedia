A numeral $\\overline{n}$ for a natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is the closed term obtained by applying $S$ iteratively to $0$ exactly $n$ times. Terms are built from variables, $0$, and the function symbols by finite composition; closed terms are those with no variables. Gödel arithmetization of syntax assigns to each finite syntactic object (symbols, terms, formulas, and finite sequences thereof) a natural number code via a primitive recursive map, and the fundamental metamathematical operations on codes (such as concatenation of sequences, decoding, and substitution) are primitive recursive.

The validation process confirms the problem is valid, well-posed, and grounded in established mathematical principles. We will now proceed with a detailed analysis of each option.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\nThe statement claims that for every total computable function $f \\colon \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, there exists a term $t_f(x)$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}_A = \\{0, S, +, \\times, <\\}$ that represents the function. A term in $\\mathcal{L}_A$ involving a free variable $x$ is constructed from $x$, the constant $0$, and the function symbols $S$, $+$, and $\\times$. When interpreted in the standard model of arithmetic $\\mathbb{N}$, any such term defines a polynomial function with non-negative integer coefficients. For example, the term $(x \\times x) + S(S(0))$ corresponds to the function $p(n) = n^2 + 2$.\n\nThe set of total computable functions is a much larger class than the set of polynomials. For instance, the exponential function $f(n) = 2^n$ is a well-known primitive recursive (and therefore total computable) function. However, it is not a polynomial, and thus there is no term $t(x)$ in $\\mathcal{L}_A$ that represents it. Consequently, the first part of the statement is false.\n\nThe second part of the statement, \"$Q$ proves $\\forall x \\, \\big(t_{f}(x) = \\overline{f(x)}\\big)$\", is syntactically ill-formed. The expression $\\overline{f(x)}$ is not a valid term in $\\mathcal{L}_A$; the overline notation $\\overline{n}$ applies to a specific natural number $n$ from the metatheory to produce a specific term, not to a function of a formal variable $x$. The standard way to express function properties is through representing formulas, not terms.\n\nBecause not all total computable functions are representable by terms in $\\mathcal{L}_A$, the statement is fundamentally incorrect.\n\nVerdict for A: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThis statement consists of two claims.\n\nFirst, \"There exists a primitive recursive function $\\mathrm{num} \\colon \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ that outputs the Gödel code of the numeral $\\overline{n}$\". A numeral $\\overline{n}$ is the term $S(S(\\dots S(0)\\dots))$ with $n$ applications of the successor symbol $S$. Let $\\ulcorner \\cdot \\urcorner$ denote the Gödel numbering function. The function $\\mathrm{num}(n) = \\ulcorner \\overline{n} \\urcorner$ can be defined by primitive recursion:\n- Base case: $\\mathrm{num}(0) = \\ulcorner 0 \\urcorner$, which is a specific constant.\n- Recursive step: $\\mathrm{num}(n+1) = \\ulcorner S(\\overline{n}) \\urcorner$. The Gödel code of the term $S(t)$ is a primitive recursive function of the Gödel code of the term $t$. For instance, a common Gödel scheme might define $\\ulcorner S(t) \\urcorner = 2^{\\ulcorner S \\urcorner} \\cdot 3^{\\ulcorner (\\urcorner} \\cdot 5^{\\ulcorner t \\urcorner} \\cdot 7^{\\ulcorner) \\urcorner}$. All operations involved (exponentiation, multiplication) are primitive recursive. Thus, $\\mathrm{num}(n+1)$ is a primitive recursive function of $\\mathrm{num}(n)$. This structure fits the definition of a primitive recursive function.\n\nSecond, \"...consequently the substitution function $\\mathrm{Sub}(x,y)$ that returns the Gödel code of the result of substituting the numeral $\\overline{y}$ for a fixed free variable in the formula coded by $x$ is primitive recursive.\" Let the fixed variable be $v_0$. The general substitution function, $\\mathrm{subst}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner, \\ulcorner v \\urcorner, \\ulcorner \\tau \\urcorner)$, which computes the Gödel code of $\\phi(\\tau/v)$, is known to be primitive recursive. This is a cornerstone of the arithmetization of syntax. The function in the statement, $\\mathrm{Sub}(x, y)$, can be defined as $\\mathrm{Sub}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner, n) = \\mathrm{subst}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner, \\ulcorner v_0 \\urcorner, \\ulcorner \\overline{n} \\urcorner) = \\mathrm{subst}(\\ulcorner \\phi \\urcorner, \\ulcorner v_0 \\urcorner, \\mathrm{num}(n))$. Since $\\mathrm{subst}$ and $\\mathrm{num}$ are primitive recursive, and the class of primitive recursive functions is closed under composition, $\\mathrm{Sub}$ is also primitive recursive.\n\nBoth claims are standard and correct results in recursion theory.\n\nVerdict for B: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThis statement makes two claims about Rosser's strengthening of Gödel's theorem.\n\nFirst, \"Rosser's argument avoids any use of numerals by quantifying over proof objects as sets, thereby requiring second-order arithmetic...\". This is incorrect on multiple levels. Rosser's argument is a first-order argument, formalizable in weak first-order theories like $Q$. It quantifies over the Gödel numbers of proofs, which are natural numbers, not sets. The Rosser sentence $R$ is equivalent to the formal statement, \"For any proof of $R$, there exists a proof of $\\neg R$ with a smaller Gödel number.\" This is formalized as $\\forall y (\\mathrm{Proof}(y, \\ulcorner R \\urcorner) \\to \\exists z (z < y \\wedge \\mathrm{Proof}(z, \\ulcorner \\mathrm{neg}(\\ulcorner R \\urcorner) \\urcorner)))$. Here, $y$ and $z$ are variables ranging over natural numbers. Furthermore, the construction of the sentence $R$ itself relies on the Fixed-Point Lemma, which explicitly uses a numeral $\\overline{\\ulcorner R_{form} \\urcorner}$ to achieve self-reference, where $R_{form}$ is a formula with one free variable. Numerals are thus essential, not avoided.\n\nSecond, \"...moreover, the ordering relation $<$ on proof codes cannot be represented in $Q$.\" This is also false. Proof codes are natural numbers. The ordering relation $<$ on natural numbers is directly part of the language $\\mathcal{L}_A$. A key property of Robinson's Arithmetic $Q$ is that for any two natural numbers $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, if $m < n$ then $Q \\vdash \\overline{m} < \\overline{n}$, and if $m \\not< n$ then $Q \\vdash \\neg(\\overline{m} < \\overline{n})$. This means the standard ordering relation is decidable in $Q$ for any pair of numerals, which is a form of representability sufficient for Rosser's proof.\n\nBoth claims in the statement are incorrect.\n\nVerdict for C: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThis statement makes two related claims.\n\nFirst, \"The evaluation of closed $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$-terms in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$ is primitive recursive in the Gödel code of the term...\". A closed term in $\\mathcal{L}_A$ is built from $0$ using $S$, $+$, and $\\times$. We can define a function $\\mathrm{eval}(\\ulcorner \\tau \\urcorner)$ that computes the value of the closed term $\\tau$. This function is defined by recursion on the structure of the term, which can be implemented as a primitive recursion on the Gödel number. For example, $\\mathrm{eval}(\\ulcorner \\tau_1 + \\tau_2 \\urcorner) = \\mathrm{eval}(\\ulcorner \\tau_1 \\urcelikle) + \\mathrm{eval}(\\ulcorner \\tau_2 \\urcorner)$. The parsing of the Gödel number $\\ulcorner \\tau_1 + \\tau_2 \\urcorner$ into its constituent parts $\\ulcorner \\tau_1 \\urcorner$ and $\\ulcorner \\tau_2 \\urcorner$ is a primitive recursive operation. This makes the $\\mathrm{eval}$ function itself primitive recursive. This is a standard result.\n\nSecond, \"...and for each closed term $\\tau$, $Q$ proves the specific equality $\\tau = \\overline{n}$ where $n$ is the value of $\\tau$ in $\\mathbb{N}$.\" This is a fundamental property of Robinson Arithmetic $Q$. While $Q$ is a very weak theory (it lacks induction for general formulas), its axioms for $S, +, \\times$ are sufficient to prove any specific numerical identity. This can be demonstrated by a meta-theoretic induction on the complexity of the closed term $\\tau$. For example, if $Q \\vdash \\tau_1 = \\overline{n_1}$ and $Q \\vdash \\tau_2 = \\overline{n_2}$, then the axioms of $Q$ are strong enough to prove $\\overline{n_1} + \\overline{n_2} = \\overline{n_1+n_2}$, and therefore $Q \\vdash \\tau_1 + \\tau_2 = \\overline{n_1+n_2}$. This property ensures that $Q$ can \"compute\" the value of any closed term.\n\nBoth parts of the statement are correct and crucial for the role of $Q$ as a base theory for incompleteness.\n\nVerdict for D: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n\nThis statement describes the Gödel fixed-point construction, also known as the Diagonal Lemma. The lemma states that for any formula $\\varphi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in a sufficiently strong theory $T$ (like $Q$), there exists a sentence $G$ such that $T \\vdash G \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(\\overline{\\ulcorner G \\urcorner})$. The statement accurately reflects this result.\n\nThe construction of $G$ involves arithmetizing the act of substitution. A formula $\\theta(z)$ is constructed which effectively says \"the formula resulting from substituting the numeral of $z$ into the formula with Gödel number $z$ satisfies $\\varphi$\". The sentence $G$ is then defined as $\\theta(\\overline{k})$, where $k = \\ulcorner \\theta(z) \\urcorner$. The theory $T$ is then able to prove that $G$ is equivalent to $\\varphi(\\overline{\\ulcorner G \\urcorner})$.\n\nThe statement correctly highlights that this construction \"explicitly [relies] on the fact that numerals are terms of $\\mathcal{L}_{A}$ that denote the standard natural numbers used in the self-reference.\" This is the core of the technique: the syntax has a way to refer to specific numbers (via numerals), and numbers can be used to code syntax (via Gödel numbering). The substitution of the numeral $\\overline{\\ulcorner G \\urcorner}$ for the variable $x$ in the formula $\\varphi(x)$ is the linchpin that creates the self-reference. The numeral is the syntactic object within the formal language that bridges the gap between the formula $G$ and its own code $\\ulcorner G \\urcorner$.\n\nThe statement is a correct and insightful summary of the Fixed-Point Lemma and the role of numerals within it.\n\nVerdict for E: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "2973587"}, {"introduction": "Having established the syntactic foundations, we now turn to a critical comparison of the incompleteness theorems themselves. This practice probes the key differences between the original Gödel sentence, $G_T$, and Rosser's ingenious refinement, $R_T$. By dissecting the structure of their respective proofs, you will explore why Gödel's argument requires a stronger hypothesis (like $\\omega$-consistency) than Rosser's, which holds under the weaker assumption of mere consistency, thereby clarifying the subtle interplay between a theory's consistency and its expressive limitations [@problem_id:2973586].", "problem": "Let $T$ be a recursively axiomatizable, sufficiently strong theory of arithmetic extending Robinson Arithmetic ($Q$), with a fixed Gödel numbering and standard representability of all primitive recursive relations.

For any recursively axiomatizable extension $T$ of $Q$ that is consistent, both $R_T$ and $\\neg R_T$ are unprovable in $T$, whereas showing the unprovability of $\\neg G_T$ for $G_T$ in general uses a hypothesis stronger than mere consistency (such as $\\omega$-consistency).\n\nB. The Gödel sentence $G_T$ is logically equivalent in $T$ to a sentence of the arithmetical class $\\Pi^0_1$, but any Rosser sentence $R_T$ must have arithmetical complexity strictly above $\\Pi^0_1$ (for example $\\Pi^0_2$), due to the comparison of proof codes.\n\nC. Rosser’s strengthening relies on the Hilbert–Bernays derivability conditions (HB) for the provability predicate of $T$ in order to eliminate $\\omega$-consistency, while Gödel’s original argument does not require them.\n\nD. If $T$ is merely consistent but not $1$-consistent, it is possible that $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$; however, for the Rosser sentence $R_T$, mere consistency suffices to rule out both $T \\vdash R_T$ and $T \\vdash \\neg R_T$.\n\nE. For any sound theory $T$ extending $Q$, both $G_T$ and $R_T$ are true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$, but $R_T$ can fail to be $\\Pi^0_1$; hence, the truth of $R_T$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ cannot be settled by $1$-consistency alone.\n\nSelect all correct options.", "solution": "This problem requires a careful analysis of the properties of the Gödel sentence ($G_T$) and the Rosser sentence ($R_T$) with respect to different consistency assumptions for a formal theory of arithmetic $T$.\n\nBefore evaluating the options, let's clarify the notation and complexity. The relation $\\operatorname{Prf}_T(x,y)$ is primitive recursive and thus representable by a $\\Delta^0_0$ formula (one with only bounded quantifiers). The notation $\\neg y$ in the definition of Rosser provability is shorthand for $\\mathrm{neg}(y)$, where $\\mathrm{neg}$ is the primitive recursive function that maps the Gödel number of a formula to the Gödel number of its negation.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\nThis statement correctly summarizes the fundamental difference between Gödel's and Rosser's theorems.\n- **Gödel's Theorem:** To prove that $G_T$ is unprovable, only the consistency of $T$ is needed. However, to prove that its negation, $\\neg G_T$, is also unprovable, a stronger assumption like $\\omega$-consistency is required. A merely consistent but $\\omega$-inconsistent theory could prove the (false) statement $\\neg G_T$.\n- **Rosser's Theorem:** Rosser's construction of $R_T$ was specifically designed to remove the need for $\\omega$-consistency. It establishes that for any simply consistent theory $T$ (that is sufficiently strong), both $R_T$ and its negation $\\neg R_T$ are unprovable.\nThis statement is a standard and accurate account of these results.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\nThe Gödel sentence $G_T$ is equivalent to $\\forall x\\, \\neg \\operatorname{Prf}_T(x, \\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. Since $\\operatorname{Prf}_T$ is representable by a formula with only bounded quantifiers ($\\Delta^0_0$), $G_T$ is a $\\Pi^0_1$ sentence. The Rosser sentence $R_T$ is equivalent to $\\forall x \\neg \\operatorname{RPrf}_T(x, \\ulcorner R_T \\urcorner)$. The Rosser provability relation $\\operatorname{RPrf}_T(x,y)$ is defined as $\\operatorname{Prf}_T(x,y) \\wedge \\forall z  x\\, \\neg \\operatorname{Prf}_T(z,\\mathrm{neg}(y))$. The quantifier $\\forall z  x$ is bounded, so the entire expression for $\\operatorname{RPrf}_T$ is also $\\Delta^0_0$. Consequently, $R_T$ is also a $\\Pi^0_1$ sentence. The claim that $R_T$ must have a higher complexity is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\nThe Hilbert-Bernays (HB) derivability conditions are primarily used for proving Gödel's *second* incompleteness theorem (the unprovability of the consistency statement $\\mathrm{Con}(T)$). Neither Gödel's original proof of the first incompleteness theorem nor Rosser's strengthening requires the full HB conditions. They rely on the weaker assumption that the theory is strong enough to represent all primitive recursive functions and relations. The statement misattributes the use of the HB conditions.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\nThis statement provides a more precise version of the facts in option A. A theory is $1$-consistent if it does not prove any false $\\Sigma^0_1$ sentence. If a consistent theory $T$ proves $\\neg G_T$, it is proving $\\exists x \\operatorname{Prf}_T(x, \\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$, which is a false $\\Sigma^0_1$ sentence (since consistency implies $G_T$ is not actually provable). Thus, a theory that proves $\\neg G_T$ is not $1$-consistent. It is indeed possible to construct such consistent but not $1$-consistent theories. In contrast, Rosser's theorem guarantees that for any merely consistent theory, neither $T \\vdash R_T$ nor $T \\vdash \\neg R_T$ can occur. This statement is accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\nFor any sound theory $T$ (one that proves only true sentences in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$), both $G_T$ and $R_T$ are indeed true. Since $T$ is sound, it is consistent, so $T$ does not prove $G_T$ or $R_T$. The sentence $G_T$ asserts its own unprovability, which is true. The sentence $R_T$ asserts a more complex unprovability condition which is also true because $T \\not\\vdash R_T$. However, the statement claims that \"$R_T$ can fail to be $\\Pi^0_1$\". As established in the analysis of option B, this is false; $R_T$ is a $\\Pi^0_1$ sentence. The premise of the second clause is incorrect, making the entire statement flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2973586"}]}
