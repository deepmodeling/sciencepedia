If $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms, then $(t_1+t_2)$ and $(t_1 \\times t_2)$ are terms.\n\nSince we are concerned only with *closed* terms, we do not consider variables in our inductive basis.\n\nThe interpretation of a term $t$ in the structure $\\mathcal{N}$, denoted $t^{\\mathcal{N}}$, is defined by the following semantic clauses:\n-   $0^{\\mathcal{N}} = 0 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n-   $(S(t_1))^{\\mathcal{N}} = S^{\\mathcal{N}}(t_1^{\\mathcal{N}})$, where $S^{\\mathcal{N}}$ is the successor function $n \\mapsto n+1$.\n-   $(t_1+t_2)^{\\mathcal{N}} = t_1^{\\mathcal{N}} +^{\\mathcal{N}} t_2^{\\mathcal{N}}$, where $+^{\\mathcal{N}}$ is standard addition on $\\mathbb{N}$.\n-   $(t_1 \\times t_2)^{\\mathcal{N}} = t_1^{\\mathcal{N}} \\times^{\\mathcal{N}} t_2^{\\mathcal{N}}$, where $\\times^{\\mathcal{N}}$ is standard multiplication on $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nLet $P(t)$ be the property \"there exists a unique $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $t^{\\mathcal{N}} = n$\". We prove that $P(t)$ holds for all closed $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{PA}}$-terms $t$.\n\n**Base Case:** The simplest closed term is the constant symbol $0$.\nLet $t$ be the term $0$. According to the semantic rules, its interpretation is $t^{\\mathcal{N}} = 0^{\\mathcal{N}} = 0$. Here, the natural number is $n=0$. This number is unique. Thus, $P(0)$ holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:** We assume that for some closed terms $t_1$ and $t_2$, the property $P$ holds. That is, there exist unique natural numbers $n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $t_1^{\\mathcal{N}} = n_1$ and $t_2^{\\mathcal{N}} = n_2$.

Let $n = n_1+1$. The uniqueness of $n$ follows from the uniqueness of $n_1$ and the fact that the successor function is injective. Thus, $P(S(t_1))$ holds.\n\n**Case 2: Addition.** Let $t = (t_1+t_2)$.\nBy the induction hypothesis, $t_1^{\\mathcal{N}} = n_1$ and $t_2^{\\mathcal{N}} = n_2$ for unique $n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nUsing the semantic clause for the function symbol $+$:\n$$t^{\\mathcal{N}} = (t_1+t_2)^{\\mathcal{N}} = t_1^{\\mathcal{N}} +^{\\mathcal{N}} t_2^{\\mathcal{N}} = n_1 + n_2$$\nSince $\\mathbb{N}$ is closed under addition, the sum $n_1+n_2$ is a natural number. Let $n = n_1+n_2$. The uniqueness of $n$ follows from the uniqueness of $n_1$ and $n_2$ and the fact that addition is a well-defined function. Thus, $P(t_1+t_2)$ holds.\n\n**Case 3: Multiplication.** Let $t = (t_1 \\times t_2)$.\nBy the induction hypothesis, $t_1^{\\mathcal{N}} = n_1$ and $t_2^{\\mathcal{N}} = n_2$ for unique $n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nUsing the semantic clause for the function symbol $\\times$:\n$$t^{\\mathcal{N}} = (t_1 \\times t_2)^{\\mathcal{N}} = t_1^{\\mathcal{N}} \\times^{\\mathcal{N}} t_2^{\\mathcal{N}} = n_1 \\times n_2$$\nSince $\\mathbb{N}$ is closed under multiplication, the product $n_1 \\times n_2$ is a natural number. Let $n = n_1 \\times n_2$. The uniqueness of $n$ follows from the uniqueness of $n_1$ and $n_2$ and the fact that multiplication is a well-defined function. Thus, $P(t_1 \\times t_2)$ holds.\n\nBy the principle of structural induction, the property $P(t)$ holds for all closed $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{PA}}$-terms $t$. This completes the proof.\n\n**Part 2: Computation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the denotation in $\\mathcal{N}$ of the closed term $t = S(S(0)+S(0))$. We apply the semantic clauses recursively, working from the innermost terms outwards.\n\n1.  First, we find the denotation of the constant symbol $0$:\n    $$0^{\\mathcal{N}} = 0$$\n\n2.

Now, we can evaluate the sum $S(0)+S(0)$:\n    $$(S(0)+S(0))^{\\mathcal{N}} = (S(0))^{\\mathcal{N}} +^{\\mathcal{N}} (S(0))^{\\mathcal{N}} = 1 + 1 = 2$$\n\n4.  Finally, we apply the outermost successor function $S$ to the result from the previous step:\n    $$(S(S(0)+S(0)))^{\\mathcal{N}} = S^{\\mathcal{N}}((S(0)+S(0))^{\\mathcal{N}}) = S^{\\mathcal{N}}(2) = 2+1 = 3$$\n\nThe denotation of the term $S(S(0)+S(0))$ in the standard model $\\mathcal{N}$ is the natural number $3$.

By the Compactness Theorem, $Q \\cup \\Sigma$ has a model; its reduct to $L$ is a nonstandard model of $Q$.\n\nThis statement describes the classic compactness argument for the existence of nonstandard models of arithmetic. Let us verify its soundness step-by-step.\n1.  Let `$T = Q \\cup \\Sigma$` be a theory in the expanded language `$L' = L \\cup \\{c\\}$`. Here, `$Q$` is the set of axioms of Robinson arithmetic and `$\\Sigma = \\{\\overline{0} < c, \\overline{1} < c, \\overline{2} < c, \\dots\\}$`.\n2.  To apply the Compactness Theorem, we must show that every finite subset of `$T$` has a model. Let `$\\Delta$` be an arbitrary finite subset of `$T$`. `$\\Delta$` will contain the (finite) axioms of `$Q$` and a finite collection of sentences from `$\\Sigma$`, say `$\\{\\overline{n_1} < c, \\overline{n_2} < c, \\dots, \\overline{n_k} < c\\}$`.\n3.  Let `$N = \\max\\{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k\\} + 1$`. We can construct a model for `$\\Delta$` using the standard model `$\\mathbb{N}$` of arithmetic. We interpret the symbols of `$L$` as usual in `$\\mathbb{N}`. We interpret the new constant `$c$` as the standard natural number `$N$`.\n4.  Under this interpretation, the axioms of `$Q$` are satisfied because `$\\mathbb{N}$` is a model of `$Q$`. The sentences `$\\overline{n_i} < c$` become the statements `$n_i < N$`, which are true for all `$i=1, \\dots, k$` by our choice of `$N$`. Thus, `$\\Delta$` has a model.\n5.  Since every finite subset of `$T$` has a model, the Compactness Theorem guarantees that the entire set `$T$` has a model, which we denote `$\\mathcal{M}`$.\n6.  In `$\\mathcal{M}`$, all sentences of `$T$` are true. In particular, `$\\mathcal{M} \\models Q$` and `$\\mathcal{M} \\models \\overline{n} < c` for all `$n \\in \\mathbb{N}`$. This means the element interpreting `$c$`, let's call it `$c^{\\mathcal{M}}$`, is greater than any element interpreting a standard numeral `$\\overline{n}$`.\n7.  The reduct of `$\\mathcal{M}$` to the language `$L$` is a model of `$Q$`. This model contains the set of elements `$\\{\\overline{0}^{\\mathcal{M}}, \\overline{1}^{\\mathcal{M}}, \\overline{2}^{\\mathcal{M}}, \\dots\\}$`, which forms an initial segment isomorphic to `$\\mathbb{N}`$. However, it also contains the element `$c^{\\mathcal{M}}$`, which is not in this initial segment. Therefore, the model is not isomorphic to `$\\mathbb{N}` and is a nonstandard model of `$Q$`.\nThe argument is entirely correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. The Compactness Theorem cannot be applied to $Q$ to obtain nonstandard models because $Q$ is incomplete and lacks the induction schema of Peano Arithmetic (PA).\n\nThe Compactness Theorem is a fundamental property of first-order logic. It states that a set of sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset has a model. The applicability of this theorem depends only on the logic being first-order, not on the properties of the specific theory in question (such as completeness, decidability, or the inclusion of particular axioms like induction). As demonstrated in the analysis of option A, the theorem is precisely the tool used to establish the existence of nonstandard models for theories like `$Q$` (and also for PA). The weakness of `$Q$` relative to PA does not preclude the use of the Compactness Theorem.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. There exist countable nonstandard models of $Q$.\n\nThe argument in option A establishes the existence of a nonstandard model `$\\mathcal{M}`$. The language `$L' = L \\cup \\{c\\}$` is countable. The set of axioms `$T = Q \\cup \\Sigma$` is also countable, as `$Q$` is finite and `$\\Sigma$` is countably infinite. Therefore, `$T$` is a countable theory. The model `$\\mathcal{M}$` whose existence is guaranteed by the Compactness Theorem could have any infinite cardinality. However, the Downward Löwenheim–Skolem Theorem states that if a countable theory in a first-order language has an infinite model, then it has a countable infinite model.\nSince `$T$` has a model (`$\\mathcal{M}`), it must have a countable model, say `$\\mathcal{M}_{coun}$`. This model `$\\mathcal{M}_{coun}$` satisfies all axioms in `$T$`, which means it is a model of `$Q$` containing an element `$c^{\\mathcal{M}_{coun}}$` that is larger than all standard natural numbers. Thus, `$\\mathcal{M}_{coun}}$` is a countable nonstandard model of `$Q$`.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Any model of $Q$ containing an element $c$ such that $\\overline{n} < c$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ must satisfy the full first-order induction schema.\n\nThis statement claims that any nonstandard model of `$Q$` is also a model of Peano Arithmetic (PA), since PA is essentially `$Q$` plus the first-order schema of induction. This is false. `$Q$` is a strictly weaker theory than PA. There are statements provable in PA that are not provable in `$Q$`. In fact, there are instances of the induction schema itself which are not provable from the axioms of `$Q$`.\nLet `$\\psi$` be an instance of the induction schema that is not provable in `$Q$`. Then the theory `$Q \\cup \\{\\neg\\psi\\}$` is consistent. Since this theory is consistent, by the Completeness Theorem, it has a model, `$\\mathcal{M'}`$. This model `$\\mathcal{M'}`` satisfies `$Q$` but fails to satisfy an instance of the induction schema, so it is not a model of PA.\nCould `$\\mathcal{M'}`` be the standard model `$\\mathbb{N}$`? No, because `$\\mathbb{N}$` is a model of PA and therefore satisfies all instances of the induction schema, including `$\\psi$`. Since `$\\mathcal{M'} \\neq \\mathbb{N}$`, `$\\mathcal{M'}`` must be a nonstandard model of `$Q$`.\nTherefore, `$\\mathcal{M'}`` is a nonstandard model of `$Q$` which does not satisfy the full first-order induction schema. This provides a direct counterexample to the statement.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The infinite set $\\Sigma = \\{\\overline{n} < c : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ can be replaced by the single sentence $\\forall x\\,(x < c)$ to obtain the same compactness-based conclusion that $Q$ has a nonstandard model.\n\nThis suggests forming the theory `$T' = Q \\cup \\{\\forall x\\,(x < c)\\}$`. Let us analyze the consistency of `$T'$`. Assume `$T'$` has a model, `$\\mathcal{M}$`. Then `$\\mathcal{M} \\models Q$` and `$\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\,(x < c)$`. The sentence `$\\forall x\\,(x < c)$` asserts that for every element `$a$` in the domain of `$\\mathcal{M}$`, the relation `$a < c$` holds. Since this must hold for *all* elements, it must hold for the element interpreting `$c$` itself. That is, the model `$\\mathcal{M}$` must satisfy `$c < c$`.\nHowever, the axioms of `$Q$` are sufficient to prove the irreflexivity of the less-than relation, i.e., `$Q \\vdash \\forall z \\, \\neg(z < z)$`. The definition `$x < y` is shorthand for `$x \\leq y \\land x \\neq y`$. Thus, `$z < z$` would imply `$z \\leq z \\land z \\neq z$`, which is a contradiction.\nSo, the theory `$T'` is inconsistent, as it proves both `$c < c$` (from `$\\forall x(x<c)$` by universal instantiation) and `$\\neg(c < c)$` (from the axioms of `$Q$`). An inconsistent theory has no models. Therefore, this approach cannot be used to prove the existence of any model, let alone a nonstandard one. The error lies in confusing quantification over the standard numerals (which are terms in the language) with quantification over the entire domain of a model.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nFinal summary: Statements A and C are correct descriptions of established results in model theory concerning Robinson arithmetic. Statements B, D, and E are based on fundamental misunderstandings of the Compactness Theorem, the relationship between `$Q$` and PA, and the nature of first-order quantification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$"}]}
