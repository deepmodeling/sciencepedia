It is a valid, well-posed, and scientifically sound problem in mathematical logic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, let's establish the arithmetical complexity of the sentences $G_T$ and $R_T$.\nThe relation $\\operatorname{Prf}_T(x,y)$ is primitive recursive, so it can be represented by a $\\Delta^0_0$ formula (a formula with only bounded quantifiers). Let's denote this formula by $\\mathbf{Prf}_T(x,y)$.\nThe Gödel sentence $G_T$ is provably equivalent in $T$ to the sentence $\\forall x\\, \\neg \\mathbf{Prf}_T(x,\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. Since $\\mathbf{Prf}_T$ is $\\Delta^0_0$, its negation is also $\\Delta^0_0$. A universal quantifier over a $\\Delta^0_0$ formula results in a $\\Pi^0_1$ formula. Thus, $G_T$ is a $\\Pi^0_1$ sentence.\n\nFor the Rosser sentence $R_T$, the Rosser provability relation is $\\operatorname{RPrf}_T(x,y) \\equiv \\operatorname{Prf}_T(x,y) \\wedge \\forall z < x\\, \\neg \\operatorname{Prf}_T(z,\\neg y)$. The corresponding formula $\\mathbf{RPrf}_T(x,y)$ is a conjunction of $\\mathbf{Prf}_T(x,y)$ (which is $\\Delta^0_0$) and $\\forall z < x\\, \\neg \\mathbf{Prf}_T(z,\\operatorname{neg}(y))$ (which is also $\\Delta^0_0$ because the quantifier is bounded). Thus, $\\mathbf{RPrf}_T(x,y)$ is a $\\Delta^0_0$ formula.\nThe Rosser sentence $R_T$ is provably equivalent in $T$ to $\\forall x\\, \\neg \\mathbf{RPrf}_T(x, \\ulcorner R_T \\urcorner)$. By the same reasoning as for $G_T$, this is a $\\Pi^0_1$ sentence.\n\nWith these preliminaries, we can evaluate each option.\n\n**A. For any recursively axiomatizable extension $T$ of $Q$ that is consistent, both $R_T$ and $\\neg R_T$ are unprovable in $T$, whereas showing the unprovability of $\\neg G_T$ for $G_T$ in general uses a hypothesis stronger than mere consistency (such as $\\omega$-consistency).**\n\nThis statement accurately captures the essence of Rosser's strengthening of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem.\n1.  **Rosser's Theorem:** This theorem states that for any consistent, recursively axiomatizable, and sufficiently strong theory $T$, both the Rosser sentence $R_T$ and its negation $\\neg R_T$ are unprovable in $T$. The proof relies only on the consistency of $T$.\n2.  **Gödel's Theorem:** Showing $T \\not\\vdash G_T$ requires only that $T$ is consistent. The argument is as follows: if $T \\vdash G_T$, then there is a proof of $G_T$, so $\\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ is a true $\\Sigma^0_1$ sentence. Since $T$ is sufficiently strong, $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. However, by definition, $T \\vdash G_T \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$, so $T \\vdash \\neg \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. Thus $T$ is inconsistent.\n    However, to show $T \\not\\vdash \\neg G_T$, one needs a stronger assumption. If $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$, then $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$, i.e., $T \\vdash \\exists x \\operatorname{Prf}_T(x, \\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. But if $T$ is consistent, it does not prove $G_T$, so for every standard numeral $\\overline{n}$, $\\neg \\operatorname{Prf}_T(\\overline{n},\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ is true, and since this is a true PR statement, $T \\vdash \\neg \\operatorname{Prf}_T(\\overline{n},\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. Thus, we have $T \\vdash \\exists x \\operatorname{Prf}_T(x, \\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ and for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $T \\vdash \\neg \\operatorname{Prf}_T(\\overline{n}, \\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. This configuration is a direct violation of $\\omega$-consistency. Therefore, if $T$ is $\\omega$-consistent, then $T \\not\\vdash \\neg G_T$. Mere consistency is insufficient, as there exist consistent but $\\omega$-inconsistent theories that do prove $\\neg G_T$.\n\nThe statement is a correct summary of these fundamental results.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The Gödel sentence $G_T$ is logically equivalent in $T$ to a sentence of the arithmetical class $\\Pi^0_1$, but any Rosser sentence $R_T$ must have arithmetical complexity strictly above $\\Pi^0_1$ (for example $\\Pi^0_2$), due to the comparison of proof codes.**\n\nThe first part of the statement is correct; as shown in the preliminaries, $G_T$ is a $\\Pi^0_1$ sentence. However, the second part is incorrect. As also shown, the formula for $R_T$ is $\\forall x\\, \\neg \\mathbf{RPrf}_T(x, \\ulcorner R_T \\urcorner)$, where $\\mathbf{RPrf}_T(x,y)$ is a $\\Delta^0_0$ formula. The \"comparison of proof codes\" is handled by a bounded quantifier ($\\forall z < x$), which does not increase the complexity beyond $\\Delta^0_0$. Therefore, $R_T$ is also a $\\Pi^0_1$ sentence.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Rosser’s strengthening relies on the Hilbert–Bernays derivability conditions (HB) for the provability predicate of $T$ in order to eliminate $\\omega$-consistency, while Gödel’s original argument does not require them.**\n\nThis statement misattributes the use of the Hilbert-Bernays (HB) conditions. The proofs of the first incompleteness theorem, both Gödel's and Rosser's versions (i.e., the unprovability of $G_T$, $R_T$, and their negations under appropriate conditions), primarily rely on the representability of all primitive recursive relations in $T$. The full HB conditions, particularly $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\urcorner)$, are essential for the proof of Gödel's *second* incompleteness theorem (the unprovability of the consistency statement, $\\operatorname{Con}(T)$). Neither Gödel's first theorem nor Rosser's strengthening requires these conditions.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. If $T$ is merely consistent but not $1$-consistent, it is possible that $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$; however, for the Rosser sentence $R_T$, mere consistency suffices to rule out both $T \\vdash R_T$ and $T \\vdash \\neg R_T$.**\n\nThis statement is a more precise version of statement A.\n1.  **Possibility of $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$**: A theory $T$ is $1$-consistent if it proves no false $\\Sigma^0_1$ sentences. If $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$, it means $T \\vdash \\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$. The sentence $\\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ is a $\\Sigma^0_1$ sentence. If $T$ is consistent, then $T \\not\\vdash G_T$, which means there is no proof of $G_T$ in $T$. Therefore, the sentence $\\operatorname{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G_T \\urcorner)$ is false in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$. If $T$ proves this false $\\Sigma^0_1$ sentence, $T$ cannot be $1$-consistent. Conversely, it is known that one can construct a consistent theory $T$ which is not $1$-consistent and for which $T \\vdash \\neg G_T$. Thus, the first part of the statement is correct.\n2.  **Sufficiency of consistency for $R_T$**: As established in the analysis of option A, this is the main result of Rosser's theorem. Mere consistency is indeed sufficient to establish that both $R_T$ and $\\neg R_T$ are independent of $T$.\n\nThis statement provides an accurate and precise comparison.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. For any sound theory $T$ extending $Q$, both $G_T$ and $R_T$ are true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$, but $R_T$ can fail to be $\\Pi^0_1$; hence, the truth of $R_T$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ cannot be settled by $1$-consistency alone.**\n\nA sound theory $T$ proves only sentences true in the standard model $\\mathbb{N}$. Soundness implies $\\omega$-consistency, which in turn implies $1$-consistency and consistency.\n1.  **Truth of $G_T$ and $R_T$**: Since a sound theory $T$ is consistent, $T \\not\\vdash G_T$ and $T \\not\\vdash R_T$. The statement $G_T$ asserts the unprovability of $G_T$ in $T$, and $R_T$ asserts its own \"Rosser-unprovability\". As argued in the analysis of option A, since $T \\not\\vdash R_T$, the condition $\\operatorname{RPrf}_T(n, \\ulcorner R_T \\urcorner)$ is false for every natural number $n$, so $\\forall x \\neg \\operatorname{RPrf}_T(x, \\ulcorner R_T \\urcorner)$ is true. Thus both $G_T$ and $R_T$ are true in $\\mathbb{N}$. The first part is correct.\n2.  **Complexity of $R_T$**: As shown in the analysis of option B, the claim that \"$R_T$ can fail to be $\\Pi^0_1$\" is false. $R_T$ is constructed to be a $\\Pi^0_1$ sentence.\n3.  **Conclusion**: The word \"hence\" indicates that the conclusion follows from the premise about complexity. Since the premise is false, the argument is unsound.\n\nThe overall statement is flawed due to the incorrect assertion about the arithmetical complexity of $R_T$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2973586"}, {"introduction": "The diagonal lemma enables us to move beyond simple incompleteness and investigate what a theory can prove about its own provability predicate.

Given the problem's setup (a theory $T$ satisfying the HBL conditions), this is a correct theorem of logic.\n\nThe second part, \"therefore, for conjectures not already proved in $T$, it is implausible that $T$ proves $\\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\to \\varphi$ without also proving $\\varphi$\", is a direct and correct consequence of the first part.

The Hilbert–Bernays–Löb derivability conditions ensure that for every sentence $\\varphi$, $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\to \\varphi$; this is compatible with the consistency of $T$.**\n\nThis statement claims that $T$ proves the reflection principle for all sentences $\\varphi$. This is known as the Global Reflection Principle. Let's examine the consequences of this claim. If this principle held for every sentence, it would have to hold for the specific sentence $0=1$. This would mean $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urvenir) \\to (0=1)$. By propositional logic, this is equivalent to $T \\vdash \\neg \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urvenir)$. The sentence $\\neg \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urvenir)$ is the formal statement of $T$'s consistency, denoted $\\mathrm{Con}(T)$.

Let's apply Löb's theorem to this sentence. Löb's theorem states that if $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\mathrm{Con}(T) \\urvenir) \\to \\mathrm{Con}(T)$, then it must be that $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Con}(T)$.\n\nAs established by Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, a consistent theory $T$ of sufficient strength cannot prove its own consistency, so $T \\nvdash \\mathrm{Con}(T)$.\n\nCombining these two facts, we see that if $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\mathrm{Con}(T) \\urvenir) \\to \\mathrm{Con}(T)$ were to hold, it would lead to $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Con}(T)$, which contradicts Gödel's theorem.

We can show this with a counterexample. Let $T$ be Peano Arithmetic ($PA$). Consider the consistency statement of $PA$, $\\mathrm{Con}(PA)$. Assuming $PA$ is in fact consistent (which is a standard belief in mathematics), $\\mathrm{Con}(PA)$ is a sentence that is true in the standard model of arithmetic, $\\mathbb{N}$. By Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, $PA \\nvdash \\mathrm{Con}(PA)$.\nAccording to the claim in this option, since $\\mathrm{Con}(PA)$ is true, $PA$ should be able to prove its reflection principle, i.e., $PA \\vdash \\mathrm{Prov}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\mathrm{Con}(PA) \\urvenir) \\to \\mathrm{Con}(PA)$.\nHowever, as analyzed in option C, this is not possible. By Löb's theorem, if $PA$ proved this reflection principle, it would also prove $\\mathrm{Con}(PA)$, which it does not.\nAnother classic counterexample is the Gödel sentence $G$ for $T$, which asserts its own unprovability. $G$ is true in $\\mathbb{N}$ and $T \\nvdash G$. By Löb's theorem, if $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner G \\urvenir) \\to G$, then $T \\vdash G$, a contradiction.

For any sentence $\\varphi$, $T \\vdash \\mathrm{Prov}_T(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\to \\varphi$ if and only if $T \\vdash \\varphi$.**\n\nThis is the most precise and complete statement of Löb's theorem.

The completeness proof relies on the schema $D1$ in the form $PA \\vdash \\varphi \\Rightarrow PA \\vdash RProv_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$, which is invalid for $RProv_{PA}$ and thereby breaks the proof at the soundness step.\n\nD. The verification that the arithmetical interpretation of Löb’s axiom $\\Box(\\Box \\varphi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\Box \\varphi$ is provable in $PA$ uses $D3$ to internalize the step from $Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$ to $Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\urvenir)$ within $PA$; since $RProv_{PA}$ fails $D3$, the arithmetical counterpart of Löb’s axiom may not be provable, undermining completeness.\n\nE. The completeness proof fails because the Kripke frames for $GL$ are not well-founded; using $RProv_{PA}$ corrects this by enforcing $\\omega$-consistency at the frame level, which the proof requires.\n\nChoose all that apply.", "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The logical system under consideration is Gödel–Löb provability logic, denoted as $GL$.\n- The interpretation is arithmetical, within Peano Arithmetic ($PA$).\n- The modal operator $\\Box$ is interpreted as the standard arithmetical provability predicate $Prov_{PA}(x)$.\n- The context is Solovay's arithmetical completeness proof for $GL$.\n- The proof utilizes the Hilbert–Bernays–Löb (HBL) derivability conditions:\n    - $D1$: If $PA \\vdash \\varphi$, then $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$.\n    - $D2$: $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\to \\psi \\urvenir) \\to (Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir))$.\n    - $D3$: $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\urvenir)$.\n- An alternative predicate, the Rosser provability predicate $RProv_{PA}(x)$, is introduced.

All concepts mentioned—$GL$, $PA$, $Prov_{PA}(x)$, $RProv_{PA}(x)$, the HBL conditions, and Solovay's theorems—are standard, well-defined, and central to the field. The properties attributed to $Prov_{PA}$ and $RProv_{PA}$ are accurate. The problem is factually and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The question is precise. It asks for the identification of specific failure points in a well-known mathematical proof (Solovay's completeness proof) when a key component ($Prov_{PA}$) is substituted with an alternative ($RProv_{PA}$) that lacks certain specified properties ($D2, D3$). This structure admits a definite and verifiable answer based on the details of the proof.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in formal, technical language, free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question within mathematical logic. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to identify which parts of Solovay's arithmetical completeness proof for $GL$ depend critically on the derivability conditions $D2$ and $D3$. These are the conditions that the standard provability predicate $Prov_{PA}$ satisfies but a Rosser-type predicate $RProv_{PA}$ does not.\n\nSolovay's theorem has two main parts: soundness ($GL \\vdash \\theta \\Rightarrow$ for all substitutions $*, PA \\vdash \\theta^*$) and completeness ($GL \\not\\vdash \\theta \\Rightarrow$ there exists a substitution $*$ such that $PA \\not\\vdash \\theta^*$). Both parts rely on the HBL conditions. We will analyze each option.\n\n**A. The construction of arithmetical fixed points (via the diagonal lemma) for the realization of modal formulas fundamentally requires $D2$, so the fixed-point step cannot be carried out for $RProv_{PA}$.**\n\nThe Diagonal Lemma states that for any formula $\\Psi(x)$ in the language of arithmetic with one free variable $x$, there exists a sentence $\\varphi$ such that $PA \\vdash \\varphi \\leftrightarrow \\Psi(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$. The proof of this lemma is a general result about the expressive power of theories like $PA$ that can represent their own syntax. The proof does not depend on the specific properties of the formula $\\Psi(x)$, other than its being a formula of the language. The Rosser provability predicate, $RProv_{PA}(x)$, is given by a $\\Sigma_1$ formula, and thus the Diagonal Lemma applies to it without issue. For instance, the classic Rosser sentence $\\rho$ is constructed as a fixed point $PA \\vdash \\rho \\leftrightarrow \\exists y (Proof_{PA}(y, \\ulcorner \\rho \\urvenir) \\land \\forall z \\le y \\neg Proof_{PA}(z, \\ulcorner \\neg \\rho \\urvenir))$. One can just as easily construct fixed points involving $RProv_{PA}$. The construction of fixed points is therefore possible. The issue is not the existence of such fixed points, but the provable properties they possess, which in turn depend on the properties of the predicate used. Hence, this statement is factually incorrect.\n\n**Verdict for A: Incorrect**\n\n**B. In the truth lemma for $\\Box$, to infer $PA \\vdash A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^\\ast \\urvenir)$ from the inductive hypotheses $PA \\vdash A_v \\to \\theta^\\ast$ for all $v$ with $w R v$, one needs $D2$ to pass from $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\to \\theta^\\ast \\urvenir)$ to $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urvenir) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^\\ast \\urvenir)$ and then combine this with $PA \\vdash A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urvenir)$; without $D2$ this chain of implications fails for $RProv_{PA}$.**\n\nThis option describes a crucial step in the inductive proof of the \"truth lemma\" which connects the Kripke model semantics to arithmetical provability. The lemma states that for any formula $\\psi$ and any world $w$ in the finite Kripke counter-model, $w \\models \\psi \\iff PA \\vdash A_w \\to \\psi^*$, where $\\psi^*$ is the arithmetical realization of $\\psi$ and $A_w$ is the arithmetical sentence corresponding to world $w$.\n\nConsider the inductive step for a formula $\\Box\\theta$, assuming the lemma holds for $\\theta$. Suppose $w \\models \\Box\\theta$. This means for all successor worlds $v$ such that $w R v$, we have $v \\models \\theta$.\nBy the inductive hypothesis ($IH$), for all such $v$, we have $PA \\vdash A_v \\to \\theta^*$.\nA crucial feature of the construction of the sentences $A_w$ in Solovay's proof is that for each successor $v$ of $w$ ($w R v$), we have $PA \\vdash A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urvenir)$ (or a related property concerning disjunctions of successors).\nNow, from the $IH$ ($PA \\vdash A_v \\to \\theta^*$), by condition $D1$ (as a rule of inference), it follows that $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\to \\theta^* \\urvenir)$.\nHere, we must apply condition $D2$: $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\to \\theta^* \\urvenir) \\to (Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urvenir) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^* \\urvenir))$.\nCombining these steps, we can reason within $PA$:\n$A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urvenir)$ (from construction)\n$Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urvenir) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^* \\urvenir)$ (from $IH$, $D1$, $D2$)\nTherefore, $PA \\vdash A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^* \\urvenir)$, which is $PA \\vdash A_w \\to (\\Box\\theta)^*$.\n\nThis chain of reasoning explicitly and indispensably uses $D2$ to distribute the provability predicate over the implication derived from the inductive hypothesis. If $Prov_{PA}$ were replaced by $RProv_{PA}$, for which $D2$ does not hold, this inference would be blocked, and the inductive proof of the truth lemma would fail. This statement accurately pinpoints a critical failure point.\n\n**Verdict for B: Correct**\n\n**C. The completeness proof relies on the schema $D1$ in the form $PA \\vdash \\varphi \\Rightarrow PA \\vdash RProv_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$, which is invalid for $RProv_{PA}$ and thereby breaks the proof at the soundness step.**\n\nThis statement claims that $D1$ is invalid for $RProv_{PA}$. However, the problem statement explicitly notes that \"$RProv_{PA}(x)$ can be arranged to satisfy $D1$.\" This is standard. A Rosser predicate can be defined as $RProv_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\equiv \\exists p (Proof_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\land (\\forall q < p) \\neg Proof_{PA}(q, \\ulcorner \\neg\\varphi \\urvenir))$. If $PA \\vdash \\varphi$, then there exists a proof of $\\varphi$, and (assuming $PA$ is consistent) no proof of $\\neg\\varphi$. Thus, $\\exists p (Proof_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\land ...)$ is true. Since this is a $\\Sigma_1$ sentence, its truth implies its provability in $PA$, so $PA \\vdash RProv_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$. Therefore, $D1$ holds for $RProv_{PA}$. The premise of the option is false.\n\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The verification that the arithmetical interpretation of Löb’s axiom $\\Box(\\Box \\varphi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\Box \\varphi$ is provable in $PA$ uses $D3$ to internalize the step from $Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$ to $Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\urvenir)$ within $PA$; since $RProv_{PA}$ fails $D3$, the arithmetical counterpart of Löb’s axiom may not be provable, undermining completeness.**\n\nThis addresses the arithmetical soundness of $GL$, a foundational part of Solovay's result. For $GL$ to be the logic of provability in $PA$, its axioms must be provable in $PA$ under the arithmetical interpretation. The characteristic axiom of $GL$ is Löb's axiom, $\\Box(\\Box p \\to p) \\to \\Box p$. Its arithmetical interpretation is the schema $Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\to \\varphi \\urvenir) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$. The proof that this schema holds for any sentence $\\varphi$ is Löb's theorem.\n\nThe proof of Löb's theorem formalized within $PA$ centrally uses all three HBL conditions. A key step in the proof involves reasoning about a fixed-point sentence $\\psi$ such that $PA \\vdash \\psi \\leftrightarrow (Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir) \\to \\varphi)$. The proof proceeds to establish $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$. This sub-proof requires inferring $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir) \\urvenir)$ from $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir)$. This is a direct application of condition $D3$. Without $D3$, this step is not possible, and the proof of Löb's theorem fails.\n\nIf $Prov_{PA}$ is replaced with $RProv_{PA}$, for which $D3$ does not hold, the arithmetical interpretation of Löb's axiom is no longer provable in $PA$. This is a catastrophic failure. It means that the proposed logic (the interpretation of $GL$ via $RProv_{PA}$) does not even satisfy its own axioms, so it cannot be a coherent provability logic. This fundamentally \"undermines completeness\" because the entire framework relating the logic $GL$ to the arithmetical interpretation would collapse.\n\n**Verdict for D: Correct**\n\n**E. The completeness proof fails because the Kripke frames for $GL$ are not well-founded; using $RProv_{PA}$ corrects this by enforcing $\\omega$-consistency at the frame level, which the proof requires.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple inaccuracies.\n$1$. The Kripke semantics for $GL$ is sound and complete with respect to the class of finite, transitive, and irreflexive frames. An irreflexive relation on a finite set is necessarily *converse well-founded* (i.e., it has no infinite ascending chains), which is the required property. The statement that the frames are \"not well-founded\" is incorrect in the context of the proof.\n$2$. The role of the Rosser predicate is misrepresented. The standard Gödel sentence $G$ requires the assumption of $\\omega$-consistency of $PA$ to prove its truth (i.e., its unprovability). Rosser's construction with $RProv_{PA}$ was specifically designed to prove the incompleteness of $PA$ using only the weaker assumption of simple consistency. Thus, $RProv_{PA}$ is a tool to *avoid* reliance on $\\omega$-consistency, not to \"enforce\" it.\n$3$. The idea of enforcing $\\omega$-consistency \"at the frame level\" is conceptually confused. $\\omega$-consistency is a property of an arithmetical theory, not a Kripke frame.\nThis option misunderstands several fundamental concepts.\n\n**Verdict for E: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, options B and D correctly identify indispensable uses of the HBL conditions ($D2$ and $D3$) that are part of Solovay's arithmetical proof system for $GL$ and which fail for a Rosser-type provability predicate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "2980166"}]}
