Fix any effective Gödel coding of deterministic Turing machines such that each machine and configuration is represented by a number in $N$. Assume the following foundational facts of computability theory and arithmetization, which you may use without proof:\n\n- There is a primitive recursive relation $R(e,x,t,y)$ that holds exactly when $y$ is the code of the complete computation history (for example, a finite tableau or sequence of configurations) of the machine coded by $e$ on input $x$ for exactly $t$ steps, and this history is correct with respect to the machine’s transition function.\n- There is a primitive recursive relation $H_{\\mathrm{fin}}(e,x,t,y)$ that holds exactly when $R(e,x,t,y)$ holds and the last configuration coded within $y$ is halting (i.e., the machine has entered a designated halting state by time $t$).\n- A formula whose matrix is a primitive recursive relation and whose quantifiers range over $N$ can be put into prenex normal form; its level in the arithmetical hierarchy is determined by the pattern of leading unbounded quantifiers: a $\\Sigma_n$-formula has a leading block of existential quantifiers followed by $n-1$ alternations, and a $\\Pi_n$-formula has a leading block of universal quantifiers followed by $n-1$ alternations, all with a decidable (primitive recursive) matrix.\n\nUsing only these bases:\n\n1. Construct a first-order formula of arithmetic $H(e,x)$ that expresses “the machine coded by $e$ halts on input $x$,” using $R$ and $H_{\\mathrm{fin}}$ as your decidable matrix.

It is scientifically grounded in the formalization of computation (Church-Turing thesis) and its relationship to formal arithmetic (as established by Gödel, Kleene, and others). All terms are precisely defined, and the premises are standard results in the field. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with no apparent logical contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n*   **Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n    The problem is deemed valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the Formula $H(e,x)$**\n\nThe assertion \"the machine coded by $e$ halts on input $x$\" is true if there exists a time $t \\in N$ and a corresponding computation history $y \\in N$ that represents a valid, halting computation. The predicate $H_{\\mathrm{fin}}(e,x,t,y)$ captures this for a specific time $t$ and history $y$. To express that a halt occurs at *some* time, we existentially quantify over $t$ and $y$.\n\nThe formula $H(e,x)$ is therefore:\n$$H(e,x) \\equiv \\exists t \\exists y \\, H_{\\mathrm{fin}}(e,x,t,y)$$\nThis formula is in prenex normal form.\n*   **Leading Quantifier Block:** $\\exists t \\exists y$. This is a single block of existential quantifiers.\n*   **Matrix:** $H_{\\mathrm{fin}}(e,x,t,y)$. The problem states that this relation is primitive recursive. A primitive recursive relation is, by definition, decidable by a Turing machine. Thus, the matrix is decidable.\n\n**Part 2: Construction of the Formula $NH(e,x)$**\n\nThe assertion \"the machine coded by $e$ does not halt on input $x$\" is the logical negation of $H(e,x)$.\n$$NH(e,x) \\equiv \\neg H(e,x)$$\nWe substitute the expression for $H(e,x)$ and convert the resulting formula to prenex normal form by applying quantifier duality rules ($\\neg \\exists z P(z) \\equiv \\forall z \\neg P(z)$).\n$$NH(e,x) \\equiv \\neg (\\exists t \\exists y \\, H_{\\mathrm{fin}}(e,x,t,y))$$\n$$\\equiv \\forall t \\, \\neg (\\exists y \\, H_{\\mathrm{fin}}(e,x,t,y))$$\n$$\\equiv \\forall t \\forall y \\, \\neg H_{\\mathrm{fin}}(e,x,t,y)$$\nThe formula $NH(e,x)$ in prenex normal form is:\n$$NH(e,x) \\equiv \\forall t \\forall y \\, \\neg H_{\\mathrm{fin}}(e,x,t,y)$$\n*   **Leading Quantifier Block:** $\\forall t \\forall y$. This is a single block of universal quantifiers.\n*   **Matrix:** $\\neg H_{\\mathrm{fin}}(e,x,t,y)$. Since $H_{\\mathrm{fin}}$ is a decidable relation, its negation $\\neg H_{\\mathrm{fin}}$ is also decidable.\n\n**Part 3: Arithmetical Hierarchy Classification**\n\nWe determine the minimal level $L(\\cdot)$ for each formula.\n\n**Classification of $H(e,x)$:**\nThe formula $H(e,x)$ has a leading block of existential quantifiers and a decidable matrix. This structure corresponds to a $\\Sigma_1$-formula. The set of pairs $(e,x)$ satisfying $H(e,x)$ is the halting set, which is known to be undecidable. A set is decidable if and only if it is definable by a $\\Delta_1$ formula (equivalent to both a $\\Sigma_1$ and a $\\Pi_1$ formula), which in turn is equivalent to having a quantifier-free definition (a $\\Sigma_0$ or $\\Pi_0$ formula over a decidable language). Since the halting set is undecidable, it cannot be defined by a $\\Sigma_0$ formula. Therefore, its minimal classification is $\\Sigma_1$.\nThis means $L(H) = 1$.\n\n**Classification of $NH(e,x)$:**\nThe formula $NH(e,x)$ has a leading block of universal quantifiers and a decidable matrix. This structure corresponds to a $\\Pi_1$-formula. The set of pairs $(e,x)$ satisfying $NH(e,x)$ is the complement of the halting set.\n1.  This set is not decidable, because if it were, its complement (the halting set) would also be decidable, which is a known falsehood. Thus, it cannot be a $\\Sigma_0$ or $\\Pi_0$ set.\n2.  We must also show it is not a $\\Sigma_1$ set. A set is definable by a $\\Sigma_1$ formula if and only if it is recursively enumerable. The halting set (defined by $H(e,x)$) is a $\\Sigma_1$-set, so it is recursively enumerable. By Post's theorem, a set is decidable (recursive) if and only if both the set and its complement are recursively enumerable. If the complement of the halting set were also recursively enumerable (i.e., $\\Sigma_1$), then the halting set would be decidable. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the set defined by $NH(e,x)$ is not $\\Sigma_1$. Its simplest classification is $\\Pi_1$.\nThis means $L(NH) = 1$.\n\n**Part 4: Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $L(H) + L(NH)$. Using the results from Part 3:\n$$L(H) = 1$$\n$$L(NH) = 1$$\nThe sum is:\n$$L(H) + L(NH) = 1 + 1 = 2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2986081"}, {"introduction": "While many problems fall neatly into a $\\Sigma_n$ or $\\Pi_n$ class, some possess a more nuanced complexity.

The predicate is defined as:\n$$\n\\Theta(e)\\;:\\;\\exists m\\;\\forall x\\;\\exists s\\;\\big(x<m\\;\\lor\\;H(e,x,s)\\big)\n$$\nwhere $H(e,x,s)$ is a primitive recursive relation indicating that the Turing machine with Gödel number $e$ halts on input $x$ within $s$ steps.\n\nFirst, we analyze the logical structure and meaning of the formula for $\\Theta(e)$.\nLet's analyze the subformula $\\forall x\\;\\exists s\\;\\big(x<m\\;\\lor\\;H(e,x,s)\\big)$ for a fixed $m$. We can split the quantification over $x$ into two parts: $x<m$ and $x\\ge m$.\n- For all $x$ such that $x<m$, the disjunct $x<m$ is true. Thus, the inner formula $\\big(x<m\\;\\lor\\;H(e,x,s)\\big)$ is true for any choice of $s$.\n- For all $x$ such that $x\\ge m$, the disjunct $x<m$ is false. The inner formula is true if and only if $\\exists s\\;H(e,x,s)$ holds.\n\nTherefore, the statement $\\forall x\\;\\exists s\\;\\big(x<m\\;\\lor\\;H(e,x,s)\\big)$ is logically equivalent to the statement $\\forall x \\;\\big(x\\ge m \\implies \\exists s\\;H(e,x,s)\\big)$.\n\nThe predicate $\\exists s\\;H(e,x,s)$ is the standard definition for \"the Turing machine with index $e$ halts on input $x$\". Let $W_e$ be the domain of the partial computable function computed by machine $e$, which is precisely the set of inputs on which it halts. So, $\\exists s\\;H(e,x,s)$ is equivalent to $x \\in W_e$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the formula for $\\Theta(e)$, we get:\n$$\n\\Theta(e) \\iff \\exists m\\;\\forall x\\;\\big(x\\ge m \\implies x \\in W_e\\big)\n$$\nThis statement asserts that there exists a number $m$ such that all natural numbers greater than or equal to $m$ are in the set $W_e$. This is the definition of the set $W_e$ being cofinite. The set of indices of cofinite recursively enumerable sets is commonly denoted as $Cof$. Thus, $\\Theta(e)$ is true if and only if $e \\in Cof$. The problem is to determine the classification of the index set $Cof$ in the arithmetical hierarchy.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nWe establish an upper bound on the complexity of $\\Theta(e)$ by analyzing its prenex normal form. The original formula is:\n$$\n\\Theta(e) \\iff \\exists m\\;\\forall x\\;\\exists s\\;\\big(x<m\\;\\lor\\;H(e,x,s)\\big)\n$$\nThe matrix of this formula is the predicate $M(e,m,x,s) \\equiv \\big(x<m\\;\\lor\\;H(e,x,s)\\big)$. The relation $H(e,x,s)$ is given as primitive recursive. The relation $x<m$ is also primitive recursive. The set of primitive recursive relations is closed under Boolean connectives, so their disjunction $M(e,m,x,s)$ is also a primitive recursive predicate. Since all primitive recursive predicates are recursive (decidable), the matrix is a recursive predicate involving free variables $e, m, x, s$.\n\nThe formula for $\\Theta(e)$ has a quantifier prefix of $\\exists\\forall\\exists$ in front of a recursive matrix. According to the definition of the arithmetical hierarchy, a set defined by a formula with a prefix of $n$ alternating quantifiers starting with $\\exists$ is a $\\Sigma_n$ set. Here, we have $3$ alternating quantifiers starting with $\\exists$.\nTherefore, the set $\\{e \\mid \\Theta(e)\\}$ is in the class $\\Sigma_3$. This shows that the minimal value for $n$ is at most $3$.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show that $n=3$ is the minimal value, we must demonstrate that $\\Theta$ is not equivalent to any formula in $\\Sigma_2$ or $\\Pi_2$. This is achieved by showing that the set $Cof = \\{e \\mid \\Theta(e)\\}$ is $\\Sigma_3$-hard. A set is $\\Sigma_n$-hard if every $\\Sigma_n$ set can be many-one reduced to it. A well-known result in computability theory is that $Cof$ is $\\Sigma_3$-complete, meaning it is in $\\Sigma_3$ and is $\\Sigma_3$-hard.\n\nTo justify this hardness, we can sketch the reduction of a known $\\Sigma_3$-complete set to $Cof$. A canonical $\\Sigma_3$-complete set is $Rec = \\{e \\mid W_e \\text{ is a recursive set}\\}$. The reduction requires constructing a total computable function $f$ such that for any index $e$, $e \\in Rec \\iff f(e) \\in Cof$.\nThe machine with index $f(e)$ is constructed to behave as follows:\n- The machine $M_{f(e)}$ on an input $s$ attempts to find evidence that $W_e$ is recursive. Evidence for $W_e$ being recursive is an index $i$ such that $W_i = \\overline{W_e}$.\n- The machine $M_{f(e)}$ systematically searches for such an index $i$. At stage $s$, it might check if a candidate index $i < s$ appears to compute the complement of $W_e$ on some initial segment of inputs $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$, based on computations of $M_e$ and $M_i$ that halt within $s$ steps.\n- The behavior of $M_{f(e)}$ is defined such that:\n    1. If $e \\in Rec$, there exists a correct index $i_0$ for $\\overline{W_e}$. The search process will eventually find and lock onto verifying $i_0$. This process is designed to ensure that $M_{f(e)}$ halts on all but a finite number of inputs. Thus, $W_{f(e)}$ is cofinite, so $f(e) \\in Cof$.\n    2. If $e \\notin Rec$, no such index $i$ exists. Any candidate index $i$ will eventually be found to be incorrect. The machine $M_{f(e)}$ is designed so that this perpetual discarding of incorrect candidates causes $M_{f(e)}$ to fail to halt on an infinite number of inputs. Thus, $W_{f(e)}$ is not cofinite, so $f(e) \\notin Cof$.\n\nThis reduction $Rec \\le_m Cof$ proves that $Cof$ is $\\Sigma_3$-hard. By Post's theorem, a set that is $\\Sigma_n$-complete (for $n \\ge 1$) cannot be in $\\Pi_n$, nor can it be in $\\Sigma_k$ or $\\Pi_k$ for any $k < n$. Therefore, $Cof$ cannot be in $\\Sigma_2$ or $\\Pi_2$.\n\nSince $\\Theta(e)$ defines a $\\Sigma_3$-complete set, it is not equivalent to any formula at a level lower than $3$ in the arithmetical hierarchy.
