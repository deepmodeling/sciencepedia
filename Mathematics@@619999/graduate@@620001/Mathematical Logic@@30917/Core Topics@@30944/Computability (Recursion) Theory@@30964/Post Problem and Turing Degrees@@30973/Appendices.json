Specifically, an oracle computation $\\Phi_e^X(x)$, when convergent, has a finite use, denoted $\\mathrm{use}(\\Phi_e^X;x)$, indicating the largest oracle query made on $X$ during the computation, and c.e. sets are built by monotone enumeration from a computable listing of candidates.\n\nWhich of the following outlines correctly describes a finite-injury priority construction with permitting that meets every requirement $R_e$ and $S_e$ and achieves $A \\nle_T B$ and $B \\nle_T A$?\n\nA.

For each $e$, reserve disjoint fresh witnesses $x_e$ for $R_e$ and $y_e$ for $S_e$, chosen above all currently active higher-priority restraints. Maintain restraint functions $r_e^A$ and $r_e^B$ that are nondecreasing in $e$ and over stages. Strategy for $R_e$: wait for a stage $s$ at which $\\Phi_e^{B_s}(x_e)\\downarrow$ with use $u$; set $r_e^B := u$ to protect this computation for lower-priority strategies, and if $\\Phi_e^{B_s}(x_e)=0$, then wait for a permitting event in $B$, i.e., some future stage $t$ at which $B$ changes below $u$, and then enumerate $x_e$ into $A$ to force permanent disagreement; if $\\Phi_e^{B_s}(x_e)=1$, do nothing since $A(x_e)=0$ by default and disagreement holds.

Restraints are reset only by higher-priority actions and increase monotonically, so each lower-priority requirement is injured only finitely many times.

Their method is the archetypal finite-injury priority argument. The core idea is to assign priorities to the requirements and build the sets $A$ and $B$ in stages. At each stage, we attend to the highest-priority requirement that needs attention. An action taken for a high-priority requirement may invalidate the assumptions made by a lower-priority requirement, an event called an \"injury\". The construction is \"finite-injury\" if it can be proven that each requirement is injured only a finite number of times.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**Option A Evaluation**\nThis option proposes a single global restraint $r$ and claims that requirements can be met \"without injury\". The history of computability theory shows this approach to be untenable. Post's program involved searching for such a \"priority-free\" or \"injury-free\" construction, but he was unable to find one. The interactions between the requirements are complex; for instance, satisfying $R_e$ by enumerating an element $x_e$ into $A$ could spoil a computation for an $S_k$ that was relying on $A$ being unchanged. The need to resolve these potentially infinite conflicts is precisely why a priority system is necessary. A construction solving Post's problem must involve a mechanism for resolving conflicts, which leads to injuries. Claiming a no-injury construction is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option B Evaluation**\nThis option suggests building $A$ as a simple set and $B$ as a co-simple set, claiming this is sufficient to ensure $A \\nle_T B$ and $B \\nle_T A$. A set is simple if it is c.e., co-infinite, and its complement contains no infinite c.e. set. A set is co-simple if its complement is simple. While simple and co-simple sets are guaranteed to be non-computable, the claim that any such pair is Turing-incomparable is false. A theorem by Sacks states that for any non-computable c.e. Turing degree $\\mathbf{d}$, there exists a simple set $A$ with degree $\\mathbf{d}$. One can also construct co-simple sets of various c.e. degrees. It is possible to construct a simple set $A$ and a co-simple set $B$ such that $A \\equiv_T B$. For example, one can construct both a simple set and a co-simple set with degree $\\mathbf{0}'$ (the degree of the halting problem). Therefore, this proposed strategy does not guarantee incomparability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C Evaluation**\nThis option suggests an \"infinite-injury priority\" argument. The classical Friedberg-Muchnik construction is the textbook example of a *finite-injury* argument. Problems requiring infinite-injury arguments, such as the Sacks Splitting Theorem, are generally more complex. Applying an infinite-injury framework to a problem solvable by finite-injury methods is a category error. Furthermore, the description \"The infinite cycle of injuries ensures that the approximations eventually settle\" is vague and not a rigorous justification. In a typical infinite-injury argument, a requirement may act infinitely often, but the limit of its actions produces the desired outcome. The description provided here is not a clear representation of such an argument and, most importantly, applies the wrong technique to the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D Evaluation**\nThis option describes the framework of a finite-injury priority argument. Let's analyze its components:\n1.  **Priority Ordering:** It correctly states the standard priority ordering $R_0 \\succ S_0 \\succ R_1 \\succ S_1 \\succ \\cdots$.\n2.  **Witnesses and Restraints:** It correctly identifies the use of fresh witnesses ($x_e, y_e$) for each requirement, and the central role of restraint functions ($r_e^A, r_e^B$) which a requirement imposes to protect a computation from interference by lower-priority requirements.\n3.  **Finite-Injury Property:** It correctly summarizes the outcome of the priority system: \"Restraints are reset only by higher-priority actions... so each lower-priority requirement is injured only finitely many times.\" This is the crucial lemma in any finite-injury proof.\n4.  **Inductive Proof Structure:** It correctly notes that the proof proceeds \"By induction on priority,\" showing that every requirement is eventually satisfied.\n\nThe architecture described is entirely correct for a Friedberg-Muchnik construction. The only problematic part is the detailed description of the strategy for $R_e$:\n\"...if $\\Phi_e^{B_s}(x_e)=0$, then wait for a permitting event in $B$, i.e., some future stage $t$ at which $B$ changes below $u$, and then enumerate $x_e$ into $A$...\"\n\nThis specific mechanism, as stated, is logically flawed. A change to $B$ below the use $u$ of a computation that $R_e$ wishes to preserve would have to be initiated by a higher-priority requirement (e.g., some $S_j$ with $j < e$). Such an action by a higher-priority requirement is an **injury** to $R_e$. An injury forces the injured requirement to be reset, cancelling its current attempt. It does not \"permit\" the injured requirement to complete its action. Thus, the description conflates the concepts of injury and permission in a contradictory way.\n\nHowever, despite this significant flaw in the description of the tactical step, Option D is the only one that correctly identifies the strategic framework of the solution. The other options are fundamentally mistaken about the type of proof required (finite-injury priority argument) or the underlying computability theory principles. In the context of selecting the best description among the given choices, this option is vastly superior. It correctly outlines the entire structure of the argument, and its error is confined to the description of the internal mechanics of a single step. For this reason, it is the only plausible answer.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2978704"}, {"introduction": "While the classic solution to Post's problem builds computably enumerable sets, we can gain valuable insight from a related, simpler construction that uses an oracle for the Halting problem, $H$.

A simpler construction, which we will consider here, builds a set $A$ that is not computably enumerable but still has an intermediate Turing degree, i.e., $\\emptyset <_T A <_T H$, where $H$ is the Halting problem oracle, and $<_T$ denotes strict Turing reducibility.\n\nThe set $A$ is constructed using an oracle for $H$, ensuring $A \\le_T H$. The construction proceeds in stages to satisfy two types of requirements for all integers $e \\ge 0$:\n1.  $N_e$: $A \\neq \\phi_e$, where $\\phi_e$ is the $e$-th partial computable function. This ensures $A$ is not computable ($\\emptyset <_T A$).\n2.  $P_e$: $H \\neq \\{e\\}^A$, where $\\{e\\}^A$ is the function computed by the $e$-th oracle Turing machine (OTM) with oracle $A$. This ensures $A$ is not Turing-complete ($A <_T H$).\n\nThis problem focuses on the resources required to satisfy the $P_e$ requirements. At each stage $e=0, 1, 2, \\dots$, the construction ensures that $P_e$ is met. Assume we have already constructed a finite initial segment of $A$, denoted by the string $\\alpha_e$. The procedure to satisfy $P_e$ is to find an extension of $\\alpha_e$ that forces a disagreement between $H$ and $\\{e\\}^A$.\n\nThe strategy is as follows:\n1.  A computable, unbounded search is initiated for a \"fork\". A fork is a triple $(x, \\sigma_0, \\sigma_1)$ where $x$ is an integer and $\\sigma_0, \\sigma_1$ are finite binary strings that both extend $\\alpha_e$, such that the computation of the $e$-th OTM on input $x$ halts and gives different outputs for each oracle: $\\{e\\}^{\\sigma_0}(x) \\downarrow = 0$ and $\\{e\\}^{\\sigma_1}(x) \\downarrow = 1$.\n2.  The Halting oracle $H$ is queried **once** to determine if this search for a fork ever terminates.\n3.  **Case 1 (No fork found):** If the oracle $H$ indicates that the search will never find a fork, it implies that for any $x$, the value of $\\{e\\}^A(x)$, if it converges, is independent of any choices made for $A$ beyond $\\alpha_e$. This makes $\\{e\\}^A$ a partial computable function, which cannot be identical to the non-computable function $H$. Thus, requirement $P_e$ is satisfied. The procedure for this stage terminates.\n4.  **Case 2 (Fork found):** If the oracle $H$ indicates that a fork exists, the computable search is run until the first such fork $(x, \\sigma_0, \\sigma_1)$ is found. Then, the Halting oracle $H$ is queried a **second time** to determine the value $v = H(x)$. The construction then defines $A$ to be an extension of $\\sigma_{1-v}$, thereby ensuring that $\\{e\\}^A(x) = 1-v \\neq H(x)$. The requirement $P_e$ is satisfied.\n\nBased on this construction, the number of queries to the Halting oracle $H$ to satisfy requirement $P_e$ is either 1 (Case 1) or 2 (Case 2).\n\nCalculate the maximum possible number of queries to the Halting problem $H$ required to satisfy the first $n$ requirements, $P_0, P_1, \\dots, P_{n-1}$.", "solution": "To determine the maximum possible number of queries to the Halting oracle $H$ for satisfying the first $n$ requirements $P_0, P_1, \\dots, P_{n-1}$, consider the query usage per requirement:\n\n- For each requirement $P_e$:\n  - In Case 1 (no fork found), $H$ is queried once.\n  - In Case 2 (fork found), $H$ is queried twice (once to confirm the fork's existence and once to obtain $H(x)$).\n\nThe maximum number of queries occurs when Case 2 applies for every requirement, as it requires two queries per requirement. This scenario is possible because the construction for each $P_e$ is independent in terms of query usage, and there is no constraint forcing a requirement into Case 1.

Outcomes on the tree represent guesses about whether certain injuries happen finitely or infinitely often. A node for $R_e$ typically monitors the use of the computation $\\Phi_e^B(x)$ on its chosen witness $x$, where the use is the largest number of the oracle $B$ consulted in that computation, and imposes a restraint on $B$ below which lower-priority actions may not enumerate, to protect the computation or to control divergence.

Each node for a requirement (either $R_e$ or $S_e$) has two outcomes, labeled $f$ and $\\infty$. Outcome $f$ corresponds to the guess that higher-priority activity causes only finitely many injuries to the node’s current restraint, so the restraint eventually stabilizes. Along outcome $f$, the strategy selects a fresh witness $x$, allows the relevant computation (e.g., $\\Phi_e^B(x)$ for $R_e$) to converge with stabilized use, and then acts once to force disagreement (by enumerating into $A$ or $B$ on the side opposite the value of the computation), thereby making the computation total but unequal to the target set. Outcome $\\infty$ corresponds to the guess that higher-priority activity causes infinitely many injuries to the node’s restraint, so the use increases without bound. Along outcome $\\infty$, the strategy abandons attempting stable diagonalization and instead ensures that the attempted reduction remains partial by perpetually permitting enumerations that cause the use to grow, guaranteeing divergence of the relevant computation (e.g., $\\Phi_e^B(x)$ fails to converge), thereby also satisfying the requirement. The tree alternates nodes $R_e$ and $S_e$ by priority, and each node’s children correspond exactly to the two infinite-behavior outcomes $f$ and $\\infty$ for that node’s restraint, yielding a coherent global schedule where lower-priority nodes act only below the current restraints of all ancestors.\n\nB. Nodes branch by semantic outcomes “total” versus “partial” of $\\Phi_e^B$ or $\\Psi_e^A$, and along the “partial” branch the strategy enforces equality with the target set to finish the requirement immediately. Because totality or partiality is a global property, the outcomes are determined non-effectively, but this is acceptable since the priority tree only organizes information rather than actions.\n\nC. The tree uses three outcomes per node: one outcome asserts that $A$ enumerates infinitely many numbers below the node’s restraint, another asserts that $B$ enumerates infinitely many numbers below the node’s restraint, and a third asserts that neither does. Along the “neither” outcome the strategy injures lower-priority nodes infinitely often to prevent unintended reductions, while along the “$A$-infinite” or “$B$-infinite” outcomes the strategy switches to building reductions between $A$ and $B$ to control complexity.\n\nD. No branching is needed; a linear priority list with a queue schedule suffices. Each requirement uses a single fixed witness, and when injured, immediately reverts to its initial state. Outcomes are not guesses about injuries but counters indicating how many times a node has been injured so far, and satisfaction is achieved by freezing enumerations permanently after a fixed number of injuries, which ensures that all attempted reductions become total at high priority.\n\nWhich option is correct?", "solution": "The user wants a meticulous validation and solution for a problem in computability theory concerning Post's problem and the priority method.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Objective:** Construct two computably enumerable (c.e.) sets, $A \\subseteq \\omega$ and $B \\subseteq \\omega$, with incomparable Turing degrees.\n*   **Condition for Incomparability:** $A \\not\\le_T B$ and $B \\not\\le_T A$, where $\\le_T$ denotes Turing reducibility.\n*   **Methodology:** A classical approach using a simple priority tree to organize strategies.\n*   **Enumerations:** $\\{\\Phi_e\\}_{e \\in \\omega}$ and $\\{\\Psi_e\\}_{e \\in \\omega}$ are fixed enumerations of oracle Turing functionals.\n*   **Requirements:** For all $e \\in \\omega$, satisfy:\n    *   $R_e: \\Phi_e^B \\neq A$\n    *   $S_e: \\Psi_e^A \\neq B$\n*   **Priority Ordering:** $R_0 \\succ S_0 \\succ R_1 \\succ S_1 \\succ \\cdots$.\n*   **Strategy Sketch:**\n    *   Nodes on the tree correspond to requirements.\n    *   Strategies involve selecting witnesses (e.g., $x$) and monitoring computations (e.g., $\\Phi_e^B(x)$).\n    *   Restraints are imposed on oracles ($A$ or $B$) to protect computations.\n    *   Outcomes on the tree represent guesses about the infinite behavior of injuries from higher-priority actions.\n*   **Question:** Select the option that correctly describes such a priority tree, its outcomes, and the corresponding strategies.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded (Critical):** The problem is firmly grounded in computability theory, a branch of mathematical logic.

I will now proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for a description of a priority argument for building two Turing-incomparable computably enumerable (c.e.) sets, $A$ and $B$. The construction must satisfy an infinite list of requirements, $R_e: \\Phi_e^B \\neq A$ and $S_e: \\Psi_e^A \\neq B$, for all $e \\in \\omega$. The requirements are given a strict priority ordering, $R_0 \\succ S_0 \\succ R_1 \\succ S_1 \\succ \\cdots$.\n\nThe core difficulty is that the action taken to satisfy one requirement (e.g., $S_k$) might \"injure\" the strategy for a lower-priority requirement (e.g., $R_j$ with $j>k$). An injury to $R_j$'s strategy for witness $x_j$ occurs if a higher-priority requirement changes the oracle ($B$) below the \"use\" of the computation $\\Phi_j^B(x_j)$, potentially altering or destroying its convergence.\n\nA priority tree is a way to organize the strategies to handle these injuries. Each node on the tree corresponds to a particular requirement's strategy. The path to a node represents a finite history of the construction. The branches extending from a node represent *guesses* about the future behavior of higher-priority requirements. The construction proceeds in stages, at each stage moving further down a path in the tree. An infinite path, known as the \"true path,\" will emerge, representing the actual outcomes. The strategies along this true path will be the ones that are ultimately followed from some stage onwards, ensuring all requirements are met.\n\nLet's focus on a single node for requirement $R_e$. This node's strategy must ensure $\\Phi_e^B \\neq A$. It is subject to injury from higher-priority requirements ($R_i, S_i$ for $i<e$, and $S_e$). The crucial question for the strategy at $R_e$ is: \"Will I be injured finitely often or infinitely often by these higher-priority requirements?\" The answer to this question determines the correct long-term strategy. The tree branching models these two possibilities.\n\n*   **Outcome $f$ (finite):** This branch represents the guess that the strategy for $R_e$ will be injured only finitely many times. If this guess is correct (i.e., this branch is on the true path), then from some stage onwards, the strategy will no longer be injured. It can then execute a permanent, \"finite-injury\" style action.\n    1.  It appoints a large, fresh witness $x$.\n    2.  It waits for the computation $\\Phi_e^B(x)$ to converge, say $\\Phi_e^B(x) \\downarrow = 0$.\n    3.  It protects this computation by imposing a restraint $r_e$ on $B$, forbidding lower-priority requirements from enumerating any number less than the use of the computation into $B$.\n    4.  To ensure $\\Phi_e^B(x) \\neq A(x)$, it waits for a chance to act. If $A(x)=0$ at this stage, the strategy enumerates $x$ into $A$. This action satisfies $R_e$ for the witness $x$ forever. This action may injure lower-priority requirements, but since this node acts only once, it contributes only a single injury to those below it.\n\n*   **Outcome $\\infty$ (infinite):** This branch represents the guess that the strategy for $R_e$ will be injured infinitely often. If this guess is correct, the finite-injury strategy above will fail; every time it sets up a protected computation, a higher-priority requirement will eventually violate its restraint, forcing it to restart. However, this very fact can be used to satisfy the requirement. If the restraint is violated infinitely often, this means the oracle $B$ is changing infinitely often on inputs relevant to the computation $\\Phi_e^B(x)$. This can be leveraged to ensure that $\\Phi_e^B(x)$ *never* converges for the chosen witness $x$. If the computation $\\Phi_e^B(x)$ is divergent, then the functional $\\Phi_e^B$ is partial, and thus cannot be equal to the characteristic function of $A$ (which is total). The requirement $R_e: \\Phi_e^B \\neq A$ is therefore satisfied by ensuring non-totality.\n\nThe entire tree is built by alternating nodes for $R_e$ and $S_e$ according to their priority. A node for a requirement $P \\in \\{R_e, S_e\\}$ has two children, corresponding to the $f$ and $\\infty$ outcomes for $P$. The path taken at each stage of the construction is the one that seems correct at that moment. The true path is the leftmost path visited infinitely often. The strategies along this path are guaranteed to succeed.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Each node for a requirement (either $R_e$ or $S_e$) has two outcomes, labeled $f$ and $\\infty$. Outcome $f$ corresponds to the guess that higher-priority activity causes only finitely many injuries to the node’s current restraint, so the restraint eventually stabilizes. Along outcome $f$, the strategy selects a fresh witness $x$, allows the relevant computation (e.g., $\\Phi_e^B(x)$ for $R_e$) to converge with stabilized use, and then acts once to force disagreement (by enumerating into $A$ or $B$ on the side opposite the value of the computation), thereby making the computation total but unequal to the target set. Outcome $\\infty$ corresponds to the guess that higher-priority activity causes infinitely many injuries to the node’s restraint, so the use increases without bound. Along outcome $\\infty$, the strategy abandons attempting stable diagonalization and instead ensures that the attempted reduction remains partial by perpetually permitting enumerations that cause the use to grow, guaranteeing divergence of the relevant computation (e.g., $\\Phi_e^B(x)$ fails to converge), thereby also satisfying the requirement. The tree alternates nodes $R_e$ and $S_e$ by priority, and each node’s children correspond exactly to the two infinite-behavior outcomes $f$ and $\\infty$ for that node’s restraint, yielding a coherent global schedule where lower-priority nodes act only below the current restraints of all ancestors.**\n\nThis option provides a precise and comprehensive description of the tree-based priority method for solving Post's problem (often associated with Sacks). It correctly identifies:\n1.  The binary branching based on the nature of injuries ($f$ for finite, $\\infty$ for infinite).\n2.  The correct strategy for the \"finite injury\" outcome: stabilize, wait for convergence, and diagonalize by enumerating a witness.\n3.  The correct strategy for the \"infinite injury\" outcome: leverage the infinite injuries to force the opposing functional to be partial, thus satisfying the requirement.\n4.  The overall structure of the priority tree and the role of restraints.\nThis description is a textbook account of the method.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Nodes branch by semantic outcomes “total” versus “partial” of $\\Phi_e^B$ or $\\Psi_e^A$, and along the “partial” branch the strategy enforces equality with the target set to finish the requirement immediately. Because totality or partiality is a global property, the outcomes are determined non-effectively, but this is acceptable since the priority tree only organizes information rather than actions.**\n\nThis option is incorrect on several grounds. First, the branching is not a direct guess about the final \"total\" vs. \"partial\" nature of the functional, which is an undecidable property ($\\Sigma_2^0$ or $\\Pi_2^0$). The branching is a guess about the observable behavior of the construction itself (finitely or infinitely many injuries). Second, the described action along the \"partial\" branch is nonsensical: if a functional is partial, the requirement is already satisfied, and there is no need (or coherent way) to \"enforce equality\". Third, the claim that the tree only \"organizes information rather than actions\" is false; the tree directly dictates which strategies are active at each stage of the effective construction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The tree uses three outcomes per node: one outcome asserts that $A$ enumerates infinitely many numbers below the node’s restraint, another asserts that $B$ enumerates infinitely many numbers below the node’s restraint, and a third asserts that neither does. Along the “neither” outcome the strategy injures lower-priority nodes infinitely often to prevent unintended reductions, while along the “$A$-infinite” or “$B$-infinite” outcomes the strategy switches to building reductions between $A$ and $B$ to control complexity.**\n\nThis option describes a different, and incoherent, type of argument. Restraints are imposed by a strategy to prevent *others* from enumerating numbers below them. A strategy cannot control whether sets $A$ or $B$ have numbers enumerated into them below its restraint by higher-priority actions. Furthermore, the goal is to build incomparable sets, so switching to \"building reductions between $A$ and $B$\" is the exact opposite of the objective. The described actions are counter-intuitive and do not align with the goals of the Friedberg-Muchnik construction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. No branching is needed; a linear priority list with a queue schedule suffices. Each requirement uses a single fixed witness, and when injured, immediately reverts to its initial state. Outcomes are not guesses about injuries but counters indicating how many times a node has been injured so far, and satisfaction is achieved by freezing enumerations permanently after a fixed number of injuries, which ensures that all attempted reductions become total at high priority.**\n\nThis option incorrectly dismisses the premise of the question, which explicitly asks about a \"simple binary priority tree\". While a non-branching, linear priority list is sufficient for a simpler *finite injury* argument (the original method of Friedberg and Muchnik), it is not a tree-based method. The question specifically asks to describe the tree-based organization. Moreover, the description of the strategy is flawed. \"Freezing enumerations\" is not a viable global strategy, and the goal is not to \"ensure all attempted reductions become total\". The goal is to ensure they are unequal to the target set, which may involve forcing them to be partial.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2978712"}]}
