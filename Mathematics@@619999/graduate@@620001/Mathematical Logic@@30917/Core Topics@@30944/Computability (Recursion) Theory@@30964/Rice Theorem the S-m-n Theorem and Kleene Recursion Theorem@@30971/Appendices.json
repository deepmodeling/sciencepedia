All definitions and theorems mentioned are cornerstones of the field. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing each of the four tasks sequentially, followed by the final computation.\n\n1) Proof that the Cantor pairing function $\\langle a,b\\rangle$ is primitive recursive.\n\nThe class of primitive recursive functions (PRFs) is defined as the smallest class of functions containing the basic functions (zero, successor $S(x)=x+1$, and projections $P_i^n(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = x_i$) and closed under composition and primitive recursion. The problem states that addition ($add(a,b)=a+b$) and multiplication ($mul(a,b)=ab$) are known to be PRFs.\n\nThe Cantor pairing function is defined as $\\langle a,b\\rangle = \\frac{(a+b)(a+b+1)}{2} + b$. We construct this function from known PRFs.\n\nLet $a,b \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\nThe sum $a+b$ is a PRF. Let this be $f_1(a,b) = a+b$.\nThe term $a+b+1$ can be expressed as $S(a+b)$, the composition of the successor function $S$ and the addition function. Since both are PRFs, their composition $f_2(a,b) = S(a+b) = a+b+1$ is also a PRF.\nThe product $(a+b)(a+b+1)$ is the composition of multiplication with the functions $f_1$ and $f_2$. Specifically, $f_3(a,b) = mul(f_1(a,b), f_2(a,b)) = (a+b)(a+b+1)$. Thus, $f_3$ is a PRF.\n\nThe expression involves division by $2$. For any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, one of $n$ or $n+1$ must be even, so their product $n(n+1)$ is always divisible by $2$. The function $g(n) = n/2$ for even $n$ can be defined using bounded search, which is a primitive recursive operation. Let $div2(n) = (\\mu z \\le n)[mul(2, z) = n]$. Since the predicate inside the bounded search is PRF, the function $div2(n)$ is a PRF.\nApplying this to $f_3(a,b)$, we define $f_4(a,b) = div2(f_3(a,b)) = \\frac{(a+b)(a+b+1)}{2}$. As a composition of PRFs, $f_4$ is a PRF.\n\nFinally, $\\langle a,b\\rangle$ is the sum of $f_4(a,b)$ and $b$. This is $add(f_4(a,b), P_2^2(a,b))$. Since $add$, $f_4$, and the projection $P_2^2$ are all PRFs, their composition $\\langle a,b\\rangle$ is a primitive recursive function.\n\n2) Proof that the projection functions $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ are primitive recursive.\n\nLet $z = \\langle a,b \\rangle$. We aim to define total functions $\\pi_1(z)=a$ and $\\pi_2(z)=b$ and show they are PRFs.\nLet $w = a+b$. The defining equation is $z = \\frac{w(w+1)}{2} + b$.\nSince $0 \\le b \\le w$, we have the inequalities:\n$$ \\frac{w(w+1)}{2} \\le z \\le \\frac{w(w+1)}{2} + w = \\frac{w(w+3)}{2} $$\nAlso, $z < \\frac{(w+1)(w+2)}{2}$.\nThis implies that for a given $z$, $w$ is the unique natural number satisfying $\\frac{w(w+1)}{2} \\le z < \\frac{(w+1)(w+2)}{2}$.\nThe function $T(y) = \\frac{y(y+1)}{2}$ is strictly increasing for $y \\ge 0$.\nWe also have $w = a+b \\le \\frac{(a+b)(a+b+1)}{2} \\le z$, so we can find $w$ by a search bounded by $z$.\nLet's find $w$ as the smallest integer $y$ such that $T(y+1) > z$.\n$w = (\\mu y \\le z) [ \\frac{(y+1)(y+2)}{2} > z ]$.\nLet's rewrite the inequality: $(y+1)(y+2) > 2z$. The predicate inside the search, let's call it $Q(y,z)$, is primitive recursive as it involves only addition, multiplication, and comparison. Since the search for $y$ is bounded by $z$, the function $W(z) = (\\mu y \\le z)[Q(y,z)]$ that finds $w$ is primitive recursive.\n\nOnce $w=W(z)$ is found, we can determine $b$. From the definition, $b = z - \\frac{w(w+1)}{2}$.\nSo we define $\\pi_2(z) = z \\dot{-} \\frac{W(z)(W(z)+1)}{2}$. The function $z \\mapsto \\frac{W(z)(W(z)+1)}{2}$ is a PRF (as it is a composition of $W$ and other PRFs shown in part 1), and subtraction (specifically, proper subtraction $x \\dot{-} y = \\max(0, x-y)$) is also a PRF. Since $z \\ge \\frac{w(w+1)}{2}$, this is equivalent to standard subtraction. Thus, $\\pi_2$ is a primitive recursive function.\n\nWith $w$ and $b$ known, $a = w - b$.\nSo we define $\\pi_1(z) = W(z) \\dot{-} \\pi_2(z)$. As a composition of the PRFs $W$ and $\\pi_2$ with subtraction, $\\pi_1$ is also a primitive recursive function.\n\n3) Construction of a primitive recursive function $p(e,a)$.\n\nThe $s$-$m$-$n$ theorem (or parameterization theorem) for acceptable numberings states that for any partial computable function $\\psi(y_1, ..., y_m, x_1, ..., x_n)$ with Gödel number $k$, there exists a primitive recursive function $S_n^m(k, y_1, ..., y_m)$ such that $\\varphi_{S_n^m(k, y_1, ..., y_m)}(x_1, ..., x_n) \\simeq \\psi(y_1, ..., y_m, x_1, ..., x_n)$.\n\nWe wish to find a PRF $p(e,a)$ such that $\\varphi_{p(e,a)}(x) \\simeq \\varphi_e(\\langle a,x \\rangle)$.\nConsider the function $\\psi(v,x) \\simeq \\varphi_{\\pi_1(v)}(\\langle \\pi_2(v), x \\rangle)$.\nThis function is partial computable. Its computation involves:\ni. Computing $\\pi_1(v)$ and $\\pi_2(v)$. These are total computable (in fact, PRF).\nii. Computing $\\langle \\pi_2(v), x \\rangle$. This is total computable (PRF).\niii. Using the result of (ii) as input to the partial computable function indexed by the result of (i), via a universal Turing machine.\nThe composition of computable operations is computable, so $\\psi(v,x)$ is a partial computable function of two variables.\n\nLet $e_\\psi$ be a Gödel number for $\\psi$, so $\\varphi_{e_\\psi}^{(2)}(v,x) \\simeq \\psi(v,x)$.\nBy the $s$-$m$-$n$ theorem (with $m=1, n=1$), there exists a PRF $S_1^1$ such that $\\varphi_{S_1^1(e_\\psi, v)}(x) \\simeq \\varphi_{e_\\psi}^{(2)}(v,x)$.\nLet's define a function $s(v) = S_1^1(e_\\psi, v)$. Since $e_\\psi$ is a constant and $S_1^1$ is PRF, $s(v)$ is a PRF.\nNow, we define $p(e,a) = s(\\langle e,a \\rangle)$.\nThis function $p(e,a)$ is a composition of the PRF $s$ and the PRF pairing function $\\langle,\\rangle$, and is therefore itself primitive recursive.\n\nLet's verify the property:\nFor any $e,a,x \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n$\\varphi_{p(e,a)}(x) \\simeq \\varphi_{s(\\langle e,a \\rangle)}(x)$ by definition of $p$.\n$\\varphi_{s(\\langle e,a \\rangle)}(x) \\simeq \\psi(\\langle e,a \\rangle, x)$ by definition of $s$ and the $s$-$m$-$n$ theorem.\n$\\psi(\\langle e,a \\rangle, x) \\simeq \\varphi_{\\pi_1(\\langle e,a \\rangle)}(\\langle \\pi_2(\\langle e,a \\rangle), x \\rangle)$ by definition of $\\psi$.\nUsing the properties of the projection functions, $\\pi_1(\\langle e,a \\rangle)=e$ and $\\pi_2(\\langle e,a \\rangle)=a$.\nSo, $\\varphi_{p(e,a)}(x) \\simeq \\varphi_e(\\langle a,x \\rangle)$, as required.\n\n4) Application of Kleene's Second Recursion Theorem (KSRT).\n\nKSRT can be stated in a functional form: for any total computable function $h: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, there exists a fixed-point index $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\varphi_q(x) \\simeq \\varphi_{h(q)}(x)$.\n\nWe want to find an index $q$ such that $\\varphi_q(x) \\simeq \\varphi_{e^*}(\\langle q,x \\rangle)$ for a given index $e^*$.\nWe can construct this by defining a suitable total computable function $h$ and applying KSRT.\nLet $e^* \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be a fixed, arbitrary index.\nDefine a function $h: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ as $h(e) = p(e^*, e)$, where $p$ is the primitive recursive function from part 3.\nSince $p$ is a PRF of two arguments, and $e^*$ is a constant, the function $h(e)$ is also a PRF (by composition with a constant function and a projection). Every PRF is total computable, so $h$ is a total computable function.\n\nNow, we apply KSRT to this function $h(e)$. The theorem guarantees the existence of an index $q$ such that:\n$$ \\varphi_q(x) \\simeq \\varphi_{h(q)}(x) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $h(q)$:\n$$ \\varphi_{h(q)}(x) = \\varphi_{p(e^*, q)}(x) $$\nFrom the property of the function $p$ established in part 3, we know that for any $e', a, x$:\n$$ \\varphi_{p(e', a)}(x) \\simeq \\varphi_{e'}(\\langle a, x \\rangle) $$\nApplying this with $e' = e^*$ and $a = q$, we get:\n$$ \\varphi_{p(e^*, q)}(x) \\simeq \\varphi_{e^*}(\\langle q, x \\rangle) $$\nCombining these results, we obtain the desired fixed-point property for the index $q$:\n$$ \\varphi_q(x) \\simeq \\varphi_{e^*}(\\langle q, x \\rangle) $$\nThe reference to $f(e,x)=\\varphi_{e}(\\langle e,x\\rangle)$ in the problem statement serves as an example of a self-referential construction possible with KSRT, but the direct path to the required property for a fixed $e^*$ is as constructed above.\n\nFinal Computation:\nWe are asked to compute the value of $\\langle 7,11\\rangle$.\nUsing the definition of the Cantor pairing function with $a=7$ and $b=11$:\n$$ \\langle a,b\\rangle = \\frac{(a+b)(a+b+1)}{2} + b $$\n$$ \\langle 7,11\\rangle = \\frac{(7+11)(7+11+1)}{2} + 11 $$\n$$ \\langle 7,11\\rangle = \\frac{(18)(19)}{2} + 11 $$\n$$ \\langle 7,11\\rangle = 9 \\times 19 + 11 $$\n$$ \\langle 7,11\\rangle = 171 + 11 $$\n$$ \\langle 7,11\\rangle = 182 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{182}$$", "id": "2982135"}, {"introduction": "With the foundational tools of program parameterization in hand, we can now tackle one of the most classic results in computability theory: the construction of a \"quine.\" This exercise formalizes a quine as a program that outputs its own index and challenges you to build one from first principles [@problem_id:2982131].

The construction must be derived from first principles using the provided definitions and theorems.\n\nThe core of the construction lies in the application of Kleene's Recursion Theorem, which guarantees the existence of a fixed point for any total computable function. The constructive proof of this theorem provides an explicit formula for such a fixed point. We will adapt this construction to solve the problem.\n\nLet us define a total computable function that maps any index $y \\in \\mathbb{N}$ to an index for the constant function $C_y(x) = y$. The problem provides the necessary tools for this. We are given an index $w \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $a, x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\varphi_w(\\langle a,x \\rangle) = a$. Using the $s$-$1$-$1$ operator $s$, we can fix the first argument to $w$. For any $y \\in \\mathbb{N}$, consider the index $s(w,y)$. The function computed by this index is:\n$$\n\\varphi_{s(w,y)}(x) = \\varphi_w(\\langle y,x \\rangle) = y\n$$\nThus, $s(w,y)$ is an index for the constant function $C_y(x) = y$. The problem defines the total computable function $f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ as $f(y) = s(w,y)$. Finding a quine is equivalent to finding a fixed point for this function $f$ in the sense of the recursion theorem, i.e., an index $e$ such that $\\varphi_e \\simeq \\varphi_{f(e)}$. If such an $e$ exists, then for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n$$\n\\varphi_e(x) = \\varphi_{f(e)}(x) = \\varphi_{s(w,e)}(x) = \\varphi_w(\\langle e,x \\rangle) = e.\n$$\nThis demonstrates that a fixed point of $f$ is a quine. We now construct this fixed point explicitly.\n\nFollowing the constructive proof of Kleene's Recursion Theorem, for a given total computable function $f$, its fixed point can be found by first defining an auxiliary, two-argument partial computable function, let's call it $\\theta(y,x)$, as follows:\n$$\n\\theta(y,x) = \\varphi_{f(s(y,y))}(x)\n$$\nThis function is computable because $f$ and $s$ are total computable, and $\\varphi$ is computable (via the universal machine $\\varphi_u$).

Here, we set $e=w$ and $a=s(y,y)$:\n$$\n\\varphi_{s(w, s(y,y))}(x) = \\varphi_w(\\langle s(y,y), x \\rangle)\n$$\nFinally, we use the property of the index $w$, which is $\\varphi_w(\\langle a,x \\rangle) = a$. Here, we set $a=s(y,y)$:\n$$\n\\varphi_w(\\langle s(y,y), x \\rangle) = s(y,y)\n$$\nCombining these steps, we find that our auxiliary function is surprisingly simple:\n$$\n\\theta(y,x) = s(y,y)\n$$\nSo, the index $t$ is an index for the program that takes input $\\langle y,x \\rangle$ and outputs $s(y,y)$.

Let us verify that this index $e$ is indeed a quine. We must show that $\\varphi_e(x) = e$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe index of our candidate program is $e = s(t,t)$. Let's compute $\\varphi_e(x)$:\n$$\n\\varphi_e(x) = \\varphi_{s(t,t)}(x)\n$$\nBy the property of the $s$-$1$-$1$ function, with $e=t$ and $a=t$:\n$$\n\\varphi_{s(t,t)}(x) = \\varphi_t(\\langle t,x \\rangle)\n$$\nNow, we use the defining property of our constructed index $t$.
