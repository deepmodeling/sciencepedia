A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is divided into the three tasks delineated in the problem statement. We adopt the standard set-theoretic convention where the set of natural numbers is $\\omega = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\n**1. Formalization of the sentence $\\mathrm{Exact}(n)$**\n\nFor each natural number $n \\in \\omega$, we need to construct a first-order sentence $\\mathrm{Exact}(n)$ that is true in a structure if and only if its universe has exactly $n$ elements.\n\nA universe has exactly $n$ elements if there exist at least $n$ distinct elements, and there are at most $n$ elements.\n\nFor $n \\ge 1$, the assertion \"there exist at least $n$ distinct elements\" can be written as:\n$$ \\mathrm{AtLeast}(n) := \\exists x_1 \\exists x_2 \\dots \\exists x_n \\left( \\bigwedge_{1 \\le i  j \\le n} x_i \\neq x_j \\right) $$\nThe assertion \"there are at most $n$ elements\" can be stated as \"any set of $n+1$ elements must contain at least two that are identical,\" but a more direct approach when combined with $\\mathrm{AtLeast}(n)$ is to state that \"any element in the universe must be one of the $n$ aforementioned distinct elements.\" This is written as:\n$$ \\forall y \\left( \\bigvee_{i=1}^n y = x_i \\right) $$\nCombining these two parts under the scope of the initial existential quantifiers gives the sentence $\\mathrm{Exact}(n)$ for $n \\ge 1$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Exact}(n) := \\exists x_1 \\dots \\exists x_n \\left( \\left(\\bigwedge_{1 \\le i  j \\le n} x_i \\neq x_j\\right) \\land \\left(\\forall y \\bigvee_{i=1}^n y = x_i\\right) \\right) $$\nThis single formula constitutes a valid first-order sentence for any fixed integer $n \\ge 1$.\n\nFor the case $n=0$, the sentence must assert that the universe is empty. This can be expressed as $\\neg \\exists x (x=x)$. The general formula for $\\mathrm{Exact}(n)$ can be understood to cover this case if we adopt standard conventions for empty connectives and quantifiers. For $n=0$, the block of existential quantifiers is empty. The conjunction $\\bigwedge_{1 \\le i  j \\le 0}$ is over an empty index set, so it is vacuously true ($\\top$). The disjunction $\\bigvee_{i=1}^0$ is also over an empty index set, so it is vacuously false ($\\bot$). So, $\\mathrm{Exact}(0)$ becomes $\\top \\land \\forall y (\\bot)$, which is logically equivalent to $\\forall y (\\bot)$, or $\\neg \\exists y (\\top)$, which correctly states that there are no elements.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that all structures have nonempty universes. Consequently, for any structure $\\mathcal{M}$, the sentence $\\mathrm{Exact}(0)$ will always be false, i.e., $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\mathrm{Exact}(0)$.\n\n**2. Construction of the $L_{\\omega_{1},\\omega}$ sentence $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}}$**\n\nThe property \"the universe is finite\" is equivalent to the statement \"the cardinality of the universe is $n$ for some natural number $n \\in \\omega$.\" This can be expressed as a disjunction:\n\"The universe has size $0$\" OR \"The universe has size $1$\" OR \"The universe has size $2$\" OR ...\n\nThis corresponds to an infinite disjunction of the sentences $\\mathrm{Exact}(n)$ for all $n \\in \\omega$.\n$$ \\mathrm{Exact}(0) \\lor \\mathrm{Exact}(1) \\lor \\mathrm{Exact}(2) \\lor \\dots $$\nThe logic $L_{\\omega_{1},\\omega}$ explicitly allows for countable disjunctions. Since the set of natural numbers $\\omega$ is countable, we can formalize this infinite disjunction as a single sentence in $L_{\\omega_{1},\\omega}$.\nWe define the sentence $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}}$ as this countable disjunction:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}} := \\bigvee_{n \\in \\omega} \\mathrm{Exact}(n) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathrm{Exact}(n)$, we get the full form of the sentence.\n\n**3. Justification of the construction**\n\nWe must prove that for any $\\mathcal{L}$-structure $\\mathcal{M}$ with universe $M$, we have $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}}$ if and only if $M$ is finite.\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) First, assume that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}}$.\nBy definition, this means $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\bigvee_{n \\in \\omega} \\mathrm{Exact}(n)$.\nAccording to the semantics of $L_{\\omega_{1},\\omega}$, if a structure satisfies a countable disjunction, it must satisfy at least one of the disjuncts. Therefore, there must exist some natural number $n_0 \\in \\omega$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\mathrm{Exact}(n_0)$.\nThe sentence $\\mathrm{Exact}(n_0)$ is a first-order sentence which, by its construction, is true in $\\mathcal{M}$ if and only if the universe $M$ has exactly $n_0$ elements.\nThus, the cardinality of $M$ is $|M| = n_0$. Since $n_0$ is a natural number, it is finite. Therefore, the universe $M$ is a finite set.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Now, assume that the universe $M$ of the structure $\\mathcal{M}$ is finite.\nLet the cardinality of $M$ be $k$, so $|M| = k$. Since $M$ is finite, $k$ is a natural number, so $k \\in \\omega$.\nFurthermore, the problem states that all universes are nonempty, so we must have $k \\ge 1$.\nConsider the first-order sentence $\\mathrm{Exact}(k)$. This sentence asserts that the universe has exactly $k$ elements. Since the universe of $\\mathcal{M}$ is $M$ and $|M|=k$, the sentence $\\mathrm{Exact}(k)$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}$. That is, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\mathrm{Exact}(k)$.\nNow, let us examine the $L_{\\omega_{1},\\omega}$ sentence $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}} = \\bigvee_{n \\in \\omega} \\mathrm{Exact}(n)$.\nThis is the disjunction of all sentences $\\mathrm{Exact}(n)$ for $n \\in \\omega = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\nSince $k \\in \\omega$, the sentence $\\mathrm{Exact}(k)$ is one of the disjuncts in $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}}$.\nWe have established that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\mathrm{Exact}(k)$.\nBy the semantics of $L_{\\omega_{1},\\omega}$, if a structure satisfies one of the disjuncts of a countable disjunction, it satisfies the entire disjunction.\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\bigvee_{n \\in \\omega} \\mathrm{Exact}(n)$, which means $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}}$.\n\nThis completes the proof, showing that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}}$ if and only if the universe of $\\mathcal{M}$ is finite. The sentence $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}}$ successfully defines the property of finiteness within the logic $L_{\\omega_{1},\\omega}$.\nThe final answer is the explicit formula for $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{fin}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\bigvee_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\exists x_1 \\dots \\exists x_n \\left( \\left( \\bigwedge_{1 \\le i  j \\le n} x_i \\neq x_j \\right) \\land \\left( \\forall y \\bigvee_{k=1}^n y = x_k \\right) \\right) \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2974369"}, {"introduction": "Building on the ability to define finiteness for an entire structure, this practice explores a more nuanced application: defining a property for an infinite collection of definable subsets.

This requires us to find, for any given $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, two finite tuples $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$ that are not automorphically equivalent, yet satisfy $\\bar{a} \\equiv^k \\bar{b}$.\n\nLet $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be an arbitrary finite ordinal. By the problem statement, the set of sizes of equivalence classes is unbounded, and for each $n \\ge 1$, there is a class of size $n$. Therefore, we can choose an element $a \\in A$ from an equivalence class $[a]$ of size $k+1$, and an element $b \\in A$ from an equivalence class $[b]$ of size $k+2$.\nThe tuples we will consider are the singletons $(a)$ and $(b)$.\n\nTwo elements $x, y \\in A$ are in the same automorphism orbit if and only if their equivalence classes have the same size, i.e., $|[x]| = |[y]|$. Since $|[a]| = k+1 \\ne k+2 = |[b]|$, the tuples $(a)$ and $(b)$ are not automorphically equivalent.\n\nNow we must show that $a \\equiv^k b$. A standard result in model theory states that for finite tuples, $\\bar{a} \\equiv^k \\bar{b}$ if and only if $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$ satisfy the same $\\mathcal{L}_{\\omega, \\omega}$ formulas with at most $k$ quantifiers (i.e., quantifier rank at most $k$). This is equivalent to Player II having a winning strategy in the $k$-move Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé game on the expanded structures $(\\mathcal{A}, a)$ and $(\\mathcal{A}, b)$.\n\nConsider a formula $\\psi(x)$ with quantifier rank at most $k$. Such a formula cannot distinguish between properties that require counting to $k+1$ or more. More formally, Player II's winning strategy in the $k$-move game is as follows:\nLet the state of the game after $i$ moves be the partial isomorphism $p_i: \\{a, c_1, \\dots, c_i\\} \\to \\{b, d_1, \\dots, d_i\\}$. Player I makes a move $c_{i+1}$.\n- If $c_{i+1}$ is in a class $[c_j]$ for some $j \\le i$ (or $[a]$ if $j=0$), Player II chooses $d_{i+1}$ from the corresponding class $[d_j]$ (or $[b]$). This is possible because at move $i+1$, at most $i+1$ elements have been chosen from any given class. Since $i+1 \\le k$, and both $|[a]|$ and $|[b]|$ are greater than $k$, there are always available elements to choose from in $[a]$ and $[b]$. For any other class $C$, Player I can at most enumerate all of its $|C|$ elements; Player II can match these moves in the corresponding class $D$ as long as $|C|=|D|$.\n- If $c_{i+1}$ is in a new class $C_{\\text{new}}$ that has not been previously referenced in the game, Player II chooses an element $d_{i+1}$ from another unused class $D_{\\text{new}}$ of the same size. The existence of such a class is guaranteed because at most $k$ classes can be introduced during the game, and the structure $\\mathcal{A}$ has a supply of classes of every size.\nThis strategy ensures that the partial isomorphism is maintained for all $k$ moves.\n\nSince Player II has a winning strategy, $a \\equiv^k b$. We have found non-automorphic elements that are $\\equiv^k$ equivalent. This holds for any arbitrary finite $k$. Therefore, the Scott rank of $\\mathcal{A}$ must be an infinite ordinal, so $\\operatorname{SR}(\\mathcal{A}) \\ge \\omega$.\n\n**Part 2: Proving $\\operatorname{SR}(\\mathcal{A}) \\le \\omega$**\n\nTo show that $\\operatorname{SR}(\\mathcal{A}) \\le \\omega$, we must prove that for any finite tuples $\\bar{a}, \\bar{b} \\in A^{\\omega}$, if $\\bar{a} \\equiv^\\omega \\bar{b}$, then $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$ are automorphically equivalent.\n\nBy definition of equivalence at a limit ordinal, $\\bar{a} \\equiv^\\omega \\bar{b}$ means that $\\bar{a} \\equiv^k \\bar{b}$ for all finite $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe automorphism type of a tuple $\\bar{c} = (c_1, \\dots, c_m)$ in $\\mathcal{A}$ is determined by two pieces of information:\n1. The partition of the indices $\\{1, \\dots, m\\}$ induced by the relation $E^{\\mathcal{A}}$. That is, which elements of the tuple are in the same equivalence class.\n2. For each block in this partition, the size of the corresponding equivalence class in $A$.\n\nTwo tuples $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$ are automorphically equivalent if and only if they have the same automorphism type.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$ are not automorphically equivalent, but $\\bar{a} \\equiv^\\omega \\bar{b}$.\nSince $\\bar{a} \\equiv^0 \\bar{b}$, they must share the same quantifier-free type. This means they induce the same partition on their indices via $E^{\\mathcal{A}}$.\nSo, the reason for them not being automorphic must be that for at least one corresponding pair of elements, $a_i$ from $\\bar{a}$ and $b_i$ from $\\bar{b}$, their equivalence classes have different sizes. Let $|[a_i]| = n$ and $|[b_i]| = m$ with $n \\ne m$.\n\nWe can write an $\\mathcal{L}_{\\omega, \\omega}$ formula $\\phi_n(x)$ that expresses \"the equivalence class of $x$ has size exactly $n$\":\n$$ \\phi_n(x) := \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_n \\left( \\bigwedge_{1 \\le j  l \\le n} y_j \\ne y_l \\land \\bigwedge_{j=1}^n E(x, y_j) \\right) \\land \\forall z \\left( E(x, z) \\rightarrow \\bigvee_{j=1}^n z=y_j \\right) $$\nThe quantifier rank of $\\phi_n(x)$ is $n+1$.\n\nSince $|[a_i]| = n$, we have $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\phi_n(a_i)$. Since $|[b_i]| = m \\ne n$, we have $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\neg\\phi_n(b_i)$.\nThe formula $\\phi_n(x)$ has a finite quantifier rank of $n+1$. This implies that $a_i$ and $b_i$ can be distinguished by a formula of this rank. Therefore, $a_i \\not\\equiv^{n+1} b_i$.\n\nIf two tuples $\\bar{a}$ and $\\bar{b}$ are $\\equiv^k$ equivalent, then any pair of corresponding components $a_i$ and $b_i$ must also be $\\equiv^k$ equivalent. The contrapositive is that if $a_i \\not\\equiv^k b_i$ for some $i$, then $\\bar{a} \\not\\equiv^k \\bar{b}$.\nIn our case, with $k = n+1$, we have $a_i \\not\\equiv^{n+1} b_i$, which implies $\\bar{a} \\not\\equiv^{n+1} \\bar{b}$.\nThis contradicts our assumption that $\\bar{a} \\equiv^k \\bar{b}$ for all finite $k$.\n\nThus, our initial assumption must be false. If $\\bar{a} \\equiv^\\omega \\bar{b}$, they must be automorphically equivalent.\nThis establishes that $\\operatorname{SR}(\\mathcal{A}) \\le \\omega$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom Parts 1 and 2, we have $\\operatorname{SR}(\\mathcal{A}) \\ge \\omega$ and $\\operatorname{SR}(\\mathcal{A}) \\le \\omega$. This forces the conclusion that the Scott rank of the structure $\\mathcal{A}$ is exactly $\\omega$.\nThe Scott rank is the minimum ordinal $\\alpha$ for which $\\equiv^\\alpha$ coincides with the automorphism equivalence. Since this does not happen for any finite $\\alpha$, but does happen for $\\alpha=\\omega$, $\\omega$ is the minimum such ordinal.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\omega}$$", "id": "2974351"}]}
