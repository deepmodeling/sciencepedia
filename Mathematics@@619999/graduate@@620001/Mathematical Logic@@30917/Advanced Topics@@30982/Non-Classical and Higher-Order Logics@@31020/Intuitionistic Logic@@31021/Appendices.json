A solution will be constructed.\n\n### Solution\n\nWe are tasked with constructing a specific Kripke model and evaluating the forcing status of several formulas.\n\n**1. Specification of the Kripke Model**\n\nA Kripke model is a pair $(\\mathcal{F}, V)$ where $\\mathcal{F}$ is a frame and $V$ is a valuation.\n\n**Frame $\\mathcal{F} = (W, \\leq)$**:\n- The set of worlds is given as $W = \\{w_0, w_1\\}$.\n- The partial order $\\leq$ must be reflexive, transitive, and satisfy $w_0 \\leq w_1$. The complete set of relations defining $\\leq$ is therefore $\\{ (w_0, w_0), (w_1, w_1), (w_0, w_1) \\}$.\n  - Reflexivity ($w \\leq w$ for all $w \\in W$) is satisfied by construction.\n  - Transitivity (if $x \\leq y$ and $y \\leq z$, then $x \\leq z$) is trivially satisfied. The only non-trivial case is $w_0 \\leq w_1$ and $w_1 \\leq w_1$, which implies $w_0 \\leq w_1$, a relation already in our set.\n\n**Valuation $V$**:\nThe valuation $V$ assigns a set of worlds to each atomic proposition. Here, the only atomic proposition is $p$.\n- We are given $w_1 \\Vdash p$. By the atomic forcing clause, this implies $w_1 \\in V(p)$.\n- We are also required to ensure $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$. According to the forcing clause for $\\lor$, this means we must satisfy two conditions simultaneously: $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$ AND $w_0 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$.\n- The condition $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$ implies $w_0 \\notin V(p)$.\n- Combining these, the valuation for $p$ must be $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$.\n\n**2. Verification of Monotonicity**\n\nThe valuation $V(p)$ must be an upward-closed subset of $W$. This means that for any $w, v \\in W$, if $w \\in V(p)$ and $w \\leq v$, then it must follow that $v \\in V(p)$.\n- Let's check this property for $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$.\n- We take an arbitrary element $w \\in V(p)$, which means we must choose $w = w_1$.\n- We find all worlds $v$ such that $w_1 \\leq v$. Based on our definition of $\\leq$, the only such world is $v = w_1$.\n- The condition becomes: if $w_1 \\in V(p)$, then $w_1 \\in V(p)$. This is tautologically true.\n- Thus, the valuation $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$ is indeed upward-closed.\n\n**3. Computation of Forcing Statuses**\n\nWe now compute the forcing status for the formulas $p$, $\\neg p$, and $p \\lor \\neg p$ at each world, using only the fundamental clauses provided.\n\n**At world $w_0$**:\n- **Status of $p$**: $w_0 \\Vdash p$ if and only if $w_0 \\in V(p)$. Since $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$, we have $w_0 \\notin V(p)$. Therefore, $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$.\n  $\\llbracket p \\rrbracket_{w_0} = 0$.\n- **Status of $\\neg p$**: $w_0 \\Vdash \\neg p$ if and only if for all $v \\in W$ such that $w_0 \\leq v$, we have $v \\not\\Vdash p$. The worlds accessible from $w_0$ are $w_0$ and $w_1$.\n  - For $v = w_0$: We have already established $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$. This part of the condition holds.\n  - For $v = w_1$: We are given $w_1 \\Vdash p$.\n  Since the condition $v \\not\\Vdash p$ fails for $v = w_1$, the universal quantification is false. Therefore, $w_0 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$.\n  $\\llbracket \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_0} = 0$.\n- **Status of $p \\lor \\neg p$**: $w_0 \\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$ if and only if $w_0 \\Vdash p$ or $w_0 \\Vdash \\neg p$.\n  We have shown that $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$ and $w_0 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$. Since neither disjunct is forced, the disjunction is not forced. Therefore, $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$. This confirms our construction satisfies the problem's requirements.\n  $\\llbracket p \\lor \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_0} = 0$.\n\n**At world $w_1$**:\n- **Status of $p$**: $w_1 \\Vdash p$ if and only if $w_1 \\in V(p)$. Since $V(p) = \\{w_1\\}$, this is true. Therefore, $w_1 \\Vdash p$.\n  $\\llbracket p \\rrbracket_{w_1} = 1$.\n- **Status of $\\neg p$**: $w_1 \\Vdash \\neg p$ if and only if for all $v \\in W$ such that $w_1 \\leq v$, we have $v \\not\\Vdash p$. The only world accessible from $w_1$ is $w_1$ itself.\n  - For $v = w_1$: We must check if $w_1 \\not\\Vdash p$. But we know $w_1 \\Vdash p$.\n  The condition fails. Therefore, $w_1 \\not\\Vdash \\neg p$.\n  $\\llbracket \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_1} = 0$.\n- **Status of $p \\lor \\neg p$**: $w_1 \\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$ if and only if $w_1 \\Vdash p$ or $w_1 \\Vdash \\neg p$.\n  Since we have shown $w_1 \\Vdash p$, the first part of the disjunction is true, which makes the entire disjunction true. Therefore, $w_1 \\Vdash p \\lor \\neg p$.\n  $\\llbracket p \\lor \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_1} = 1$.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n\nThe numerical values for the forcing statuses are:\n- $\\llbracket p \\rrbracket_{w_0} = 0$\n- $\\llbracket \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_0} = 0$\n- $\\llbracket p \\lor \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_0} = 0$\n- $\\llbracket p \\rrbracket_{w_1} = 1$\n- $\\llbracket \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_1} = 0$\n- $\\llbracket p \\lor \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_1} = 1$\n\nArranging these in the specified matrix form $(\\llbracket p \\rrbracket_{w_0}, \\llbracket \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_0}, \\llbracket p \\lor \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_0}, \\llbracket p \\rrbracket_{w_1}, \\llbracket \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_1}, \\llbracket p \\lor \\neg p \\rrbracket_{w_1})$ yields the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2975588"}, {"introduction": "While Kripke models offer a relational perspective, Heyting algebras provide the corresponding algebraic semantics for intuitionistic logic.

The lattice operations are given by meet $\\wedge = \\min$ and join $\\vee = \\max$.\n\nFirst, we must characterize the Heyting implication operation $a \\to b$ for $a, b \\in \\mathcal{H}$. The definition is:\n$$a \\to b = \\sup \\{x \\in \\mathcal{H} \\mid a \\wedge x \\leq b\\}$$\nSince $\\wedge$ is the minimum function, this becomes:\n$$a \\to b = \\max \\{x \\in \\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1\\} \\mid \\min(a, x) \\leq b\\}$$\n\nBecause $\\mathcal{H}$ is totally ordered, the implication has a simpler form.\nLet's analyze two cases:\n1.  If $a \\leq b$: The condition $\\min(a, x) \\leq b$ is satisfied for all $x \\in \\mathcal{H}$, because $\\min(a,x) \\leq a \\leq b$. Thus, the set of applicable $x$ is $\\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1\\}$. The maximum of this set is $1$. So, if $a \\leq b$, then $a \\to b = 1$.\n2.  If $a > b$: For $\\min(a, x) \\leq b$ to hold, it must be that $x \\leq b$. If $x > b$, then $\\min(a, x)$ would be either $a$ (if $x \\ge a > b$) or $x$ (if $a > x > b$), and in both cases $\\min(a,x) > b$. Thus, the set of applicable $x$ is $\\{y \\in \\mathcal{H} \\mid y \\leq b\\}$. The maximum of this set is $b$ itself. So, if $a > b$, then $a \\to b = b$.\n\nWe can summarize the implication $a \\to b$ as:\n$$\na \\to b = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } a \\leq b \\\\ b & \\text{if } a > b \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNext, we define the intuitionistic negation $\\neg b$ as $\\neg b = b \\to 0$.

Since $\\frac{1}{2} > 0$, we have $\\neg \\frac{1}{2} = 0$.\n-   $\\neg 1 = 1 \\to 0$. Since $1 > 0$, we have $\\neg 1 = 0$.\n\nThe formula to evaluate is $\\varphi = (A \\to B) \\vee (A \\to \\neg B)$. A valuation $v$ assigns values from $\\mathcal{H}$ to the propositional variables $A$ and $B$. Let $v(A) = a$ and $v(B) = b$. The value of $\\varphi$ under this valuation, $v(\\varphi)$, is:\n$$v(\\varphi) = (a \\to b) \\vee (a \\to \\neg b) = \\max(a \\to b, a \\to \\neg b)$$\n\nWe now evaluate $v(\\varphi)$ for all $3 \\times 3 = 9$ possible valuations of $(a, b) \\in \\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1\\}^2$.\n\nWe can systematically analyze the cases based on the relationship between $a$ and $b$.\n\nCase 1: $a \\leq b$.\nIn this case, $a \\to b = 1$.

A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of a specific derivation $\\mathcal{D}$ in Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus ($\\mathsf{IPC}$) in light of the disjunction property. The disjunction property is a key meta-theorem of $\\mathsf{IPC}$ which states that if a disjunction $A \\lor B$ is provable, then either the formula $A$ is provable or the formula $B$ is provable. Formally, if $\\vdash_{\\mathsf{IPC}} A \\lor B$, then $\\vdash_{\\mathsf{IPC}} A$ or $\\vdash_{\\mathsf{IPC}} B$.\n\nThe proof of this property is constructive and relies on the normalization theorem for natural deduction in $\\mathsf{IPC}$. The theorem guarantees that any derivation can be converted into a *normal form*, which does not contain any maximal formulas (i.e., a formula that is the conclusion of an introduction rule and the major premise of an elimination rule for the same connective). A key consequence for a closed, normal derivation is that its last rule must be an introduction rule, unless the conclusion is an atomic formula that was an undischarged assumption (which is not the case here, as the derivation is closed).\n\nLet the given derivation be $\\mathcal{D}$. Its conclusion is the formula $(R \\to R) \\lor S$. This is a disjunction of the form $A \\lor B$, where $A$ is the formula $R \\to R$ and $B$ is the formula $S$. The problem states that $\\mathcal{D}$ is a closed derivation in normal form.\n\nAccording to the constructive proof of the disjunction property, we examine the final inference rule of $\\mathcal{D}$. Since the conclusion is a disjunction and the derivation is normal, the last rule must be a disjunction introduction rule. There are two such rules:\n1.  Left Disjunction Introduction ($\\lor\\text{-}I_{L}$): From a derivation of $A$, infer $A \\lor B$.\n2.  Right Disjunction Introduction ($\\lor\\text{-}I_{R}$): From a derivation of $B$, infer $A \\lor B$.\n\nThe problem provides an explicit construction for the derivation $\\mathcal{D}$. Let us formalize this construction:\n1.  An assumption of $R$ is made, denoted $[R]^{1}$.\n2.  The rule of $\\to$-introduction is applied to the sub-derivation from $R$ to $R$ (which is just the assumption itself), discharging the assumption $[R]^{1}$. This yields a closed derivation of $R \\to R$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{[R]^{1}}{R \\to R} (\\to\\text{-}I, 1)\n    $$\n    This sub-derivation, let's call it $\\mathcal{D}'$, is closed because the only assumption used, $[R]^{1}$, has been discharged.\n3.  The final step is described as \"Apply $\\lor$-introduction on the left disjunct to derive $(R \\to R) \\lor S$\". This means the rule of Left Disjunction Introduction ($\\lor\\text{-}I_{L}$) is applied to the conclusion of $\\mathcal{D}'$.\n\nThe complete structure of the derivation $\\mathcal{D}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} =\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{[R]^{1}}{R \\to R} (\\to\\text{-}I, 1) \\\\\n\\hrulefill (\\lor\\text{-}I_{L}) \\\\\n(R \\to R) \\lor S\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\nThis derivation is closed, as the only assumption $[R]^{1}$ is discharged by the $\\to\\text{-}I$ rule. It is also in normal form, as there are no introduction-elimination pairs.\n\nThe application of the disjunction property involves examining this final step. The final rule is $\\lor\\text{-}I_{L}$. This rule \"enables the extraction\" of a closed derivation for the left disjunct, $R \\to R$, because the premise for the $\\lor\\text{-}I_{L}$ application must be a closed derivation of that very disjunct. In this case, the extracted derivation is the sub-derivation $\\mathcal{D}'$ concluding $R \\to R$.\n\nThe problem asks to identify this final inference rule and use the provided encoding $\\iota$ to find the value $E$.\nThe encoding is given as:\n-   $\\iota(\\lor\\text{-}I_{L}) = 1$\n-   $\\iota(\\lor\\text{-}I_{R}) = 2$\n\nBased on the explicit construction of $\\mathcal{D}$, the final rule is unambiguously the Left Disjunction Introduction, $\\lor\\text{-}I_{L}$.\nTherefore, the encoded value is:\n$$\nE = \\iota(\\lor\\text{-}I_{L}) = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2975350"}]}
