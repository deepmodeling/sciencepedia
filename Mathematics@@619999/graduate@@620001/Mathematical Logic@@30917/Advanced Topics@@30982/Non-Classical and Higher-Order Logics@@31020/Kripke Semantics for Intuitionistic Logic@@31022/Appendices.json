This is formally known as the monotonicity or persistence property of the forcing relation ($ \\Vdash $). By examining a simple model, you will see how this property arises directly from the definition of a valuation and discover that the state of not having a proof for a formula—what we might call refutation—is not persistent, offering a first glimpse into the dynamics of information growth in intuitionistic models [@problem_id:2975601].", "problem": "Let a Kripke frame be a partially ordered set $(W,\\leq)$, and a Kripke model be a pair $(W,\\leq,V)$ where $V$ maps each atomic proposition $p$ to an upward-closed subset $V(p)\\subseteq W$ with respect to $\\leq$.

In this setting, call a world $w$ a “refuter” of $A$ if $w\\not\\Vdash A$.\n\nConsider the specific Kripke model with three worlds arranged linearly: $W=\\{w_0,w_1,w_2\\}$ and $w_0\\leq w_1\\leq w_2$, and valuation $V$ given by $V(p)=\\{w_1,w_2\\}$ for a single atomic proposition $p$, and $V(q)=\\varnothing$ for any other atomic proposition $q\\neq p$.\n\nLet $A$ be the formula $p$.

The problem asks to analyze the forcing of the formula $A=p$ in this model.\n\nFirst, we verify that the provided valuation $V(p)$ satisfies the monotonicity requirement, i.e., that it is an upward-closed subset of $W$. An upward-closed set $S \\subseteq W$ is one where for any $u \\in S$, if $v \\in W$ and $u \\leq v$, then $v \\in S$. The set given is $V(p) = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$.\n- Let's take $u=w_1 \\in V(p)$. The worlds $v \\in W$ such that $w_1 \\leq v$ are $w_1$ and $w_2$. Both $w_1$ and $w_2$ are in $V(p)$.\n- Let's take $u=w_2 \\in V(p)$. The only world $v \\in W$ such that $w_2 \\leq v$ is $w_2$ itself, which is in $V(p)$.\nThe condition holds for all elements of $V(p)$, so the valuation is valid.\n\nThe problem asks to demonstrate that $w_0 \\not\\Vdash A$ while $w_1 \\Vdash A$, where $A$ is the formula $p$. We use the inductive definition of the forcing relation $\\Vdash$. For an atomic proposition like $p$, the definition states:\n$w \\Vdash p$ if and only if $w \\in V(p)$.\n\n- To check if $w_0$ forces $p$, we check if $w_0 \\in V(p)$. The valuation is $V(p) = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$. Since $w_0$ is not an element of this set, we conclude that $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$.\n\n- To check if $w_1$ forces $p$, we check if $w_1 \\in V(p)$. The valuation is $V(p) = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$. Since $w_1$ is an element of this set, we conclude that $w_1 \\Vdash p$.\nThis completes the requested demonstration.\n\nNext, we must explain from first principles why refutation is not monotone upward, even though forcing is. Forcing is monotone upward; this property, often called the persistence property, states that for any formula $\\phi$, if $w \\Vdash \\phi$ and $v \\geq w$, then $v \\Vdash \\phi$. This is a fundamental characteristic of Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic and is proven by induction on the structure of the formula $\\phi$. The base case, for atomic propositions, is guaranteed by the requirement that the valuation $V(p)$ must be an upward-closed set, as verified above. This property is interpreted as the preservation of truth or knowledge: once a proposition is established, it remains established in all future states.\n\nA \"refuter\" of a formula $A$ is defined as a world $w$ such that $w \\not\\Vdash A$. The question is whether this property of refutation is monotone upward. That is, if $w \\not\\Vdash A$ and $v \\geq w$, does it necessarily follow that $v \\not\\Vdash A$?\n\nOur specific example provides a direct counterexample.\n- We established that $w_0 \\not\\Vdash p$. Thus, $w_0$ is a refuter of $p$.\n- We have the relation $w_1 \\geq w_0$.\n- We established that $w_1 \\Vdash p$. Thus, $w_1$ is *not* a refuter of $p$.\n\nWe have a world $w_0$ that refutes $p$ and a successor world $w_1 \\geq w_0$ that does not refute $p$. This demonstrates that refutation is not monotone upward. From first principles, the intuitionistic interpretation of truth is based on cumulative knowledge. The state $w \\not\\Vdash A$ signifies that at state $w$, we do not have sufficient information to assert $A$. As we move to a future state $v \\geq w$, we may gain new information. In our model, at state $w_0$, we do not have evidence for $p$. At the future state $w_1$, evidence for $p$ becomes available (as $w_1 \\in V(p)$). Therefore, the lack of evidence at $w_0$ (refutation) is superseded by the presence of evidence at $w_1$ (forcing). The \"state of not knowing\" is not persistent, whereas the \"state of knowing\" is.\n\nFinally, we must compute the cardinality of the set of worlds that force the formula $A=p$. This is the cardinality of the set $S = \\{u \\in W \\mid u \\Vdash p\\}$.\nUsing the definition of forcing for atomic propositions, this set is equivalent to $\\{u \\in W \\mid u \\in V(p)\\}$.\nGiven $W = \\{w_0, w_1, w_2\\}$ and $V(p) = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$, the set of worlds that force $p$ is precisely $V(p) \\cap W = \\{w_1, w_2\\} \\cap \\{w_0, w_1, w_2\\} = \\{w_1, w_2\\}$.\nThe cardinality of this set is $|\\{w_1, w_2\\}| = 2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2975601"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the persistent nature of truth for atomic facts, we now turn to how truth is determined for more complex statements built with logical connectives.
