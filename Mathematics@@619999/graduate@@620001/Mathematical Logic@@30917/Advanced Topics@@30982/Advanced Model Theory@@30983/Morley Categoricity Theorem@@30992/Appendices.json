That is, any definable subset of the universe $\\mathfrak{C}$ is either finite or cofinite. To see this, consider a formula $\\psi(x)$ in one free variable $x$. By quantifier elimination, $\\psi(x)$ is equivalent to a Boolean combination of atomic formulas of the form $g(x) = 0$, where $g(x)$ is a term.

Work in a sufficiently saturated and homogeneous monster model $\\mathfrak{C} \\models T$. Recall the following standard notions and facts from stability theory, which you may use as foundational starting points:\n\n- Uncountable categoricity means there is a unique model of $T$ up to isomorphism of some uncountable cardinality, and by Morley’s categoricity theorem this then holds in every uncountable cardinal.\n- A definable set $D \\subseteq \\mathfrak{C}$ is strongly minimal if every definable subset of $D$ is finite or cofinite. In a stable theory, the induced pregeometry via algebraic closure $\\operatorname{acl}$ on a strongly minimal set $D$ admits independent sets and bases, and any two bases have the same cardinality (the dimension).\n- In a countable uncountably categorical theory, by the Baldwin–Lachlan analysis, there is a strongly minimal set $D$ such that every model is (up to isomorphism) prime over an independent set $B \\subseteq D$, and the isomorphism type is determined by the dimension data (i.e., the cardinalities of bases for the nonorthogonal strongly minimal types).

In a countable uncountably categorical theory $T$ with a single nonorthogonality class of strongly minimal types, a model prime over a basis $B \\subseteq D$ is determined up to isomorphism by $|B|$, and different values $|B| \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\} \\cup \\{\\aleph_0\\}$ produce (when they occur) distinct countable models, since $\\operatorname{acl}(B)$ is countable in each of these cases.\n\nB. If $T$ is uncountably categorical, then it is also $\\aleph_0$-categorical. Hence there is exactly one isomorphism type of countable model.\n\nC. For Algebraically Closed Fields (ACF) of fixed characteristic, the construction via transcendence bases realizes the scheme above: the model is prime over a transcendence basis $B$, the cardinality $|B|$ classifies the field up to isomorphism, there are countably many nonisomorphic countable algebraically closed fields (one for each $|B| \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\} \\cup \\{\\aleph_0\\}$), and exactly one in each uncountable cardinal.\n\nD.

The correct statements are A, C, and E.\n\n*   **A is correct.** The Baldwin–Lachlan framework establishes that the isomorphism type of a model is determined by its dimension—the cardinality of a basis $B$ for its strongly minimal set(s). For a model to be countable, its basis must be countable, meaning its cardinality $|B|$ can be any finite number ($0, 1, 2, \\dots$) or countably infinite ($\\aleph_0$). Each of these distinct dimensions can produce a distinct, non-isomorphic countable model, explaining the possibility of multiple countable models.\n\n*   **B is incorrect.** Uncountable categoricity does not imply $\\aleph_0$-categoricity. The theory of algebraically closed fields is a standard counterexample, being uncountably categorical but having infinitely many non-isomorphic countable models.\n\n*   **C is correct.** The theory of algebraically closed fields ($ACF$) is the canonical example of the principle described in A. A model of $ACF$ is determined up to isomorphism by its transcendence degree over its prime field, which acts as the dimension. Each countable transcendence degree ($0, 1, 2, \\dots, \\aleph_0$) corresponds to a unique countable model, while each uncountable degree $\\kappa$ corresponds to a unique model of cardinality $\\kappa$.\n\n*   **D is incorrect.** A core result of the Baldwin–Lachlan theory is that the isomorphism type of a model depends only on the cardinality of its basis (its dimension), not the specific choice of basis elements. Any two bases of the same cardinality are automorphic within a sufficiently saturated model, and the prime models built over them will be isomorphic.\n\n*   **E is correct.** This statement correctly generalizes the principle to theories with multiple non-orthogonal strongly minimal types. The dimension data becomes a finite tuple of cardinals. For a countable model, each cardinal in the tuple must be countable.
