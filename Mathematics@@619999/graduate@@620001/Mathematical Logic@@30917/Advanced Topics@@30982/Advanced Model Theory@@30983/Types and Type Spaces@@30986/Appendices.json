A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Task 1: Prove that $T$ is a complete theory.**\n\nA theory is complete if for any sentence $\\phi$ in its language, either $T \\models \\phi$ or $T \\models \\neg\\phi$. We will show that the theory $T$ of an equivalence relation with exactly two infinite classes admits quantifier elimination (QE). A theory $T$ in a language $L$ without constant symbols that admits QE is complete.\n\nThe language is $L=\\{E\\}$. To show QE, it is sufficient to show that for any quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, the formula $\\exists x \\psi(x, \\bar{y})$ is equivalent in $T$ to a quantifier-free formula $\\theta(\\bar{y})$.\nAny quantifier-free formula is a Boolean combination of atomic formulas. In $L$, the atomic formulas are of the form $u=v$ or $E(u,v)$.\nLet $\\psi(x, \\bar{y})$ be a quantifier-free formula. By converting $\\psi$ to disjunctive normal form, $\\exists x \\bigvee_i \\chi_i(x, \\bar{y})$, we can distribute the existential quantifier over the disjunction, $\\bigvee_i \\exists x \\chi_i(x, \\bar{y})$. Thus, we only need to consider the case where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of literals.\nA literal involving $x$ can be $x=y_j$, $x \\neq y_j$, $E(x,y_j)$, or $\\neg E(x,y_j)$ for some $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$.\nIf the conjunction includes a literal $x=y_j$, then $\\exists x \\psi(x, \\bar{y})$ is equivalent to $\\psi(y_j, \\bar{y})$ (with $x$ replaced by $y_j$), which is quantifier-free.\nSo, assume the conjunction contains no literals of the form $x=y_j$. It is a conjunction of literals from the set $\\{x \\neq y_j\\}$, $\\{E(x,y_k)\\}$, $\\{\\neg E(x,y_l)\\}$, and literals not involving $x$.\nLet the formula be $\\exists x (\\bigwedge_{j \\in J} x \\neq y_j \\wedge \\bigwedge_{k \\in K} E(x,y_k) \\wedge \\bigwedge_{l \\in L} \\neg E(x,y_l) \\wedge \\theta'(\\bar{y}))$.\nThis is equivalent to $(\\exists x (\\bigwedge_{j \\in J} x \\neq y_j \\wedge \\bigwedge_{k \\in K} E(x,y_k) \\wedge \\bigwedge_{l \\in L} \\neg E(x,y_l))) \\wedge \\theta'(\\bar{y})$.\nLet's analyze the existential part. For $\\bigwedge_{k \\in K} E(x,y_k)$ to hold, all $y_k$ for $k \\in K$ must be in the same equivalence class as $x$. By transitivity, they must be in the same class as each other. This implies the condition $\\phi_K(\\bar{y}) \\equiv \\bigwedge_{k,k' \\in K} E(y_k, y_{k'})$.\nFurthermore, for $\\bigwedge_{l \\in L} \\neg E(x,y_l)$ to hold, $x$ cannot be in the same class as any $y_l$. If $K$ is non-empty, this means the class of $x$ (which is the class of the $y_k$'s) must be different from the classes of all the $y_l$'s. This gives the condition $\\phi_{KL}(\\bar{y}) \\equiv \\bigwedge_{k \\in K, l \\in L} \\neg E(y_k, y_l)$.\nIf $K$ is non-empty, and $\\phi_K(\\bar{y}) \\wedge \\phi_{KL}(\\bar{y})$ holds, we are seeking an element $x$ in the equivalence class of the $y_k$'s (say, for a fixed $k_0 \\in K, E(x, y_{k_0})$), such that $x \\neq y_j$ for a finite set of $j \\in J$. Since every class is infinite by the axioms of $T$, such an $x$ always exists. So if $K \\neq \\varnothing$, the formula is equivalent to $\\phi_K(\\bar{y}) \\wedge \\phi_{KL}(\\bar{y}) \\wedge \\theta'(\\bar{y})$, which is quantifier-free.\nIf $K$ is empty, we are analyzing $\\exists x (\\bigwedge_{j \\in J} x \\neq y_j \\wedge \\bigwedge_{l \\in L} \\neg E(x,y_l)) \\wedge \\theta'(\\bar{y})$. The $y_l$ for $l \\in L$ can belong to one class or two classes.\n- Case 1: All $y_l$ for $l \\in L$ are in the same equivalence class. This is expressed by the quantifier-free formula $\\phi_L(\\bar{y}) \\equiv \\bigwedge_{l,l' \\in L} E(y_l, y_{l'})$. The formula asks for an $x$ in the *other* equivalence class (which exists because there are two classes), satisfying $x \\neq y_j$. Since the other class is infinite, such an $x$ always exists. So in this case, the formula is equivalent to $\\phi_L(\\bar{y}) \\wedge \\theta'(\\bar{y})$.\n- Case 2: The $y_l$ for $l \\in L$ are in two distinct equivalence classes. This is expressed by $\\neg \\phi_L(\\bar{y})=\\bigvee_{l,l' \\in L} \\neg E(y_l, y_{l'})$. The formula requires $x$ to be inequivalent to elements from both classes. Since there are only two classes total, this is impossible. The formula is false.\nThus, in all cases, the existential formula is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula. So $T$ admits QE. Since $L$ has no constant symbols, any sentence is a statement whose truth value is determined by the axioms (e.g., how many classes, are they infinite). The theory $T$ decides the truth of all quantifier-free sentences (there are none apart from logical truths/falsities, as there are no constants). Therefore, $T$ is complete.\n\n**Task 2: Construct a model and compare types.**\n\nLet the set of natural numbers be $C_0 = \\mathbb{N}$ and the set of real numbers be $C_1 = \\mathbb{R}$. We can assume these sets are disjoint. Let the universe of our model $M$ be the disjoint union $U_M = C_0 \\cup C_1$. We define the relation $E^M$ on $U_M$ as follows: for any $u,v \\in U_M$, $E^M(u,v)$ holds if and only if $(u \\in C_0 \\wedge v \\in C_0)$ or $(u \\in C_1 \\wedge v \\in C_1)$.\n$E^M$ is an equivalence relation with exactly two equivalence classes, $C_0$ and $C_1$.\nThe cardinality of $C_0$ is $|C_0| = |\\mathbb{N}| = \\aleph_0$.\nThe cardinality of $C_1$ is $|C_1| = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\nBoth classes are infinite. Thus, $M$ is a model of $T$, i.e., $M \\models T$. Let $C_0^M = C_0$ and $C_1^M = C_1$.\nLet $A=\\varnothing$. We choose an element $a \\in C_0^M$ and an element $b \\in C_1^M$. We want to show that their types over $A$ are equal: $\\operatorname{tp}(a/A) = \\operatorname{tp}(b/A)$. Since $A=\\varnothing$, this is $\\operatorname{tp}(a/\\varnothing) = \\operatorname{tp}(b/\\varnothing)$.\nThe type of an element $m$ over $\\varnothing$ is the set of all formulas $\\phi(x)$ in one free variable $x$ with no parameters, such that $M \\models \\phi(m)$. We need to show that for any such formula $\\phi(x)$, $M \\models \\phi(a) \\Leftrightarrow M \\models \\phi(b)$.\nFrom Task 1, we know that $T$ admits quantifier elimination. This means that any formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent, modulo $T$, to a quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x)$. In the language $L=\\{E\\}$, the only atomic formula with a single free variable $x$ is $E(x,x)$. Any other atomic formula would involve other variables or constants, but there are no constants in $L$ and $\\phi(x)$ has only $x$ free.\nTherefore, any quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x)$ is a Boolean combination of $E(x,x)$.\nThe axiom of reflexivity, $\\forall x E(x,x)$, is in $T$. So, for any element $m$ in any model of $T$, $E(m,m)$ is true. In particular, $M \\models E(a,a)$ and $M \\models E(b,b)$.\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to a formula built from $E(x,x)$. The only possibilities for non-trivial formulas are formulas equivalent to $E(x,x)$ or $\\neg E(x,x)$ (or tautologies and contradictions).\n- If $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $E(x,x)$, then $M\\models\\phi(a)$ and $M\\models\\phi(b)$.\n- If $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\neg E(x,x)$, then $M\\not\\models\\phi(a)$ and $M\\not\\models\\phi(b)$.\nIn any case, $M \\models \\phi(a)$ if and only if $M \\models \\phi(b)$.\nTherefore, the set of formulas satisfied by $a$ is identical to the set of formulas satisfied by $b$: $\\operatorname{tp}(a/\\varnothing) = \\operatorname{tp}(b/\\varnothing)$.\n\n**Task 3: Prove non-existence of a specific automorphism.**\n\nAn automorphism of $M$ over $A=\\varnothing$ is a bijective map $\\sigma: U_M \\to U_M$ that preserves the relation $E^M$. That is, for all $u,v \\in U_M$, $E^M(u,v) \\iff E^M(\\sigma(u), \\sigma(v))$.\nLet's show that an automorphism must map equivalence classes to equivalence classes. For any $u \\in U_M$, its equivalence class is the set $[u] = \\{v \\in U_M \\mid E^M(u,v)\\}$. The image of this class under $\\sigma$ is $\\sigma([u]) = \\{\\sigma(v) \\mid E^M(u,v)\\}$. Since $E^M(u,v) \\iff E^M(\\sigma(u), \\sigma(v))$, this means $\\sigma([u]) = \\{\\sigma(v) \\mid E^M(\\sigma(u), \\sigma(v))\\} = \\{w \\mid E^M(\\sigma(u), w)\\} = [\\sigma(u)]$. So, $\\sigma$ maps the class of $u$ to the class of $\\sigma(u)$.\nSince $\\sigma$ is a bijection, it preserves the cardinality of sets. Thus, $|[u]| = |\\sigma([u])| = |[\\sigma(u)]|$. This means an automorphism must map an equivalence class to another equivalence class of the same cardinality.\nIn our model $M$, the two equivalence classes are $C_0^M$ and $C_1^M$, with cardinalities $|C_0^M| = \\aleph_0$ and $|C_1^M| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Since $\\aleph_0 \\neq 2^{\\aleph_0}$, any automorphism $\\sigma$ of $M$ must map $C_0^M$ to itself and $C_1^M$ to itself.\nWe are given $a \\in C_0^M$ and $b \\in C_1^M$. Suppose for contradiction that there exists an automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(M/\\varnothing)$ such that $\\sigma(a)=b$.\nThis would imply that $\\sigma$ maps the equivalence class of $a$ to the equivalence class of $b$. That is, $\\sigma(C_0^M) = \\sigma([a]) = [\\sigma(a)] = [b] = C_1^M$.\nThis would require the cardinalities to be equal: $|C_0^M| = |\\sigma(C_0^M)| = |C_1^M|$.\nThis yields the statement $\\aleph_0 = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, which is false by Cantor's theorem.\nTherefore, the initial assumption must be false. There is no automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(M/\\varnothing)$ such that $\\sigma(a)=b$.\n\n**Task 4: Determine the number of orbits.**\n\nWe are asked for the number of distinct $\\operatorname{Aut}(M/A)$-orbits inside the set $\\{m \\in M \\mid M \\models p(m)\\}$, where $p(x)=\\operatorname{tp}(a/A)$ and $A=\\varnothing$.\nFirst, we identify the set of realizations of $p(x)$ in $M$. Let this set be $P$. So $P = \\{m \\in M \\mid \\operatorname{tp}(m/\\varnothing) = p(x)\\}$.\nIn Task 2, we showed that for any $a \\in C_0^M$ and $b \\in C_1^M$, $\\operatorname{tp}(a/\\varnothing) = \\operatorname{tp(b/\\varnothing)}$. Let this common type be $p(x)$. It follows that any element $m \\in U_M$ realizes $p(x)$, because any $m$ belongs to either $C_0^M$ (and has the same type as $a$) or $C_1^M$ (and has the same type as $b$). Therefore, the set of realizations is the entire universe: $P = U_M$.\nWe need to find the number of orbits of $U_M$ under the action of the automorphism group $\\operatorname{Aut}(M) = \\operatorname{Aut}(M/\\varnothing)$.\nAn orbit of an element $u \\in U_M$ is the set $\\operatorname{Orb}(u) = \\{\\sigma(u) \\mid \\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(M)\\}$.\nFrom Task 3, we established that any automorphism $\\sigma$ must preserve the cardinalities of the equivalence classes. Since $|C_0^M| \\neq |C_1^M|$, we must have $\\sigma(C_0^M) = C_0^M$ and $\\sigma(C_1^M) = C_1^M$.\nThis means that if $u \\in C_0^M$, then $\\sigma(u)$ must also be in $C_0^M$ for any $\\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(M)$. So, the orbit of any element of $C_0^M$ is a subset of $C_0^M$.\nSimilarly, the orbit of any element of $C_1^M$ is a subset of $C_1^M$.\nThis proves that there are at least two orbits, as no element of $C_0^M$ can be in the same orbit as an element of $C_1^M$.\nNext, we determine if $\\operatorname{Aut}(M)$ acts transitively on each class.\n-   Consider any two elements $u, u' \\in C_0^M$. Let $\\pi_0$ be any permutation of $C_0^M$ that maps $u$ to $u'$ (e.g., the transposition $(u, u')$ if $u \\neq u'$). Let $\\pi_1$ be the identity permutation on $C_1^M$. The map $\\sigma: U_M \\to U_M$ defined by $\\sigma(x) = \\pi_0(x)$ for $x \\in C_0^M$ and $\\sigma(x) = \\pi_1(x)$ for $x \\in C_1^M$ is an automorphism of $M$. Since this $\\sigma$ maps $u$ to $u'$, it shows that any two elements in $C_0^M$ are in the same orbit. So, $C_0^M$ is a single orbit.\n-   Similarly, consider any two elements $v, v' \\in C_1^M$. Let $\\pi_1'$ be a permutation of $C_1^M$ that maps $v$ to $v'$. Let $\\pi_0'$ be the identity on $C_0^M$. The combined map is an automorphism, showing that any two elements in $C_1^M$ are in the same orbit. So, $C_1^M$ is a single orbit.\nThe orbits are the sets $C_0^M$ and $C_1^M$. These two sets are disjoint and their union is $U_M$.\nTherefore, there are exactly two distinct $\\operatorname{Aut}(M/\\varnothing)$-orbits in $U_M$.

We proceed with the solution, addressing each task in the order presented.\n\nLet $T$ be the complete first-order theory of an infinite-dimensional vector space $V$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q \\geq 2$ is an integer. The language is that of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-modules, which includes symbols for addition, subtraction, the zero element, and a unary function for scalar multiplication by each element of $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $A \\subseteq V$ be a small set of parameters.\n\n### Part 1: Determination of $\\operatorname{MR}(p)$\n\nThe Morley rank of a type $p$, denoted $\\operatorname{MR}(p)$, is defined as the minimum Morley rank among all formulas $\\phi(x)$ belonging to $p$. To determine $\\operatorname{MR}(p)$, we must first characterize the definable subsets of $V$ with parameters from $A$.\n\nThe theory $T$ of an infinite-dimensional vector space over a field admits quantifier elimination. This means that any formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ and parameters from $A$ is equivalent to a boolean combination of atomic formulas. An atomic formula in the language of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-modules with parameters from $A$ takes the form $t_1(x) = t_2(x)$, where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms. Any such term can be written as $\\lambda x + v$ for some scalar $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$ and some vector $v \\in \\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$.\n\nThus, an atomic formula is equivalent to an equation of the form $(\\lambda_1 x + v_1) = (\\lambda_2 x + v_2)$, which simplifies to $(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2)x = v_2 - v_1$. Let $\\lambda = \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2 \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$ and $v = v_2 - v_1 \\in \\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$. The equation is $\\lambda x = v$.\n\nWe analyze the solution set of this equation:\n1.  If $\\lambda \\neq 0$, the equation has a unique solution $x = \\lambda^{-1}v$. Since $v \\in \\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$, this unique solution $x$ is also an element of $\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$. The definable set is a singleton.\n2.  If $\\lambda = 0$, the equation becomes $0 = v$.\n    -   If $v = 0$, the equation $0 = 0$ is true for all $x \\in V$. The definable set is the entire space $V$.\n    -   If $v \\neq 0$, the equation is false for all $x \\in V$. The definable set is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\nAny definable subset of $V$ (with parameters in $A$) is a boolean combination of sets of these two types: singletons contained within $\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$ and the whole space $V$. Consequently, any definable subset of $V$ is either a finite set (and necessarily contained in $\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$) or a co-finite set (its complement is finite).\n\nA set with this property is called strongly minimal. By definition, a strongly minimal set has Morley rank $1$. Thus, $\\operatorname{MR}(V) = 1$.\n\nThe problem defines $p(x) \\in S_1(A)$ as the unique generic $1$-type over $A$, which is the complete type of an element $v \\in V$ such that $v \\notin \\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$. Let $\\phi(x)$ be any formula in $p(x)$. The set of realizations of $\\phi(x)$, denoted $\\phi(V)$, must contain $v$. Since $v \\notin \\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$, $\\phi(V)$ cannot be a finite set, because all finite definable sets are contained in $\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$. Therefore, $\\phi(V)$ must be a co-finite set for any $\\phi(x) \\in p(x)$. This shows that $p(x)$ is the unique non-algebraic $1$-type over $A$, which is the generic type of the strongly minimal set $V$. The Morley rank of the generic type of a strongly minimal set is equal to the rank of the set itself.\n\nHence, $\\operatorname{MR}(p) = \\operatorname{MR}(V) = 1$.\n\n### Part 2: Additivity of Morley Rank for Independent Realizations\n\nWe are asked to explain why the Morley rank is additive for a tuple of independent realizations of $p$. Let $(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ be a tuple of elements that are $\\mathbb{F}_q$-linearly independent over $A$. Let $p^{(n)}(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\operatorname{tp}(a_1, \\dots, a_n / A)$ be their joint type.\n\nThe condition that $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ are $\\mathbb{F}_q$-linearly independent over $A$ means that for any non-trivial linear combination $\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i a_i$ (where $c_i \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$ are not all zero), the result is not in $\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A)$. This is equivalent to the iterative condition: for each $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, $a_k \\notin \\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A \\cup \\{a_1, \\dots, a_{k-1}\\})$.\n\nA fundamental property of Morley rank in stable theories is the additivity formula (also known as the Lascar equality or chain rule for rank). For any tuple $(b_1, \\dots, b_n)$ and parameter set $C$, the rank of the joint type is given by:\n$$ \\operatorname{MR}(\\operatorname{tp}(b_1, \\dots, b_n / C)) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\operatorname{MR}(\\operatorname{tp}(b_k / C \\cup \\{b_1, \\dots, b_{k-1}\\})) $$\nApplying this formula to our case with $b_i = a_i$ and $C=A$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{MR}(p^{(n)}) = \\operatorname{MR}(\\operatorname{tp}(a_1, \\dots, a_n / A)) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\operatorname{MR}(\\operatorname{tp}(a_k / A \\cup \\{a_1, \\dots, a_{k-1}\\})) $$\nLet's analyze each term in this sum. For any $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, let $A_{k-1} = A \\cup \\{a_1, \\dots, a_{k-1}\\}$. The type $\\operatorname{tp}(a_k / A_{k-1})$ is the complete type of $a_k$ over the parameter set $A_{k-1}$. The condition of linear independence implies that $a_k \\notin \\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A_{k-1})$. This is exactly the definition of $a_k$ realizing the generic $1$-type over the parameter set $A_{k-1}$.\n\nThe argument from Part $1$ holds for any parameter set. The definable sets in one variable over $A_{k-1}$ are either finite (and contained in $\\operatorname{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}(A_{k-1})$) or co-finite. Thus, the generic type over $A_{k-1}$ has Morley rank $1$.\nSo, for each $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$:\n$$ \\operatorname{MR}(\\operatorname{tp}(a_k / A \\cup \\{a_1, \\dots, a_{k-1}\\})) = 1 $$\nSubstituting this back into the sum, we find:\n$$ \\operatorname{MR}(p^{(n)}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = n $$\nThis demonstrates the additivity property. The Morley rank of the joint type of linearly independent elements is the sum of the ranks of the conditional types, which are all $1$. This corresponds to the problem's phrasing about the \"sum of the ranks of the coordinates,\" noting that $\\text{tp}(a_k/A \\cup \\{a_1, \\dots, a_{k-1}\\})$ is the type of the $k$-th coordinate conditioned on the preceding ones. The property holds because, in this theory, linear independence over a parameter set is equivalent to model-theoretic independence (non-forking).\n\n### Part 3: Closed-form Expression for $\\operatorname{MR}(p^{(n)})$\n\nBased on the derivation in Part $2$, the Morley rank of the type $p^{(n)}(x_1, \\dots, x_n) = \\operatorname{tp}(a_1, \\dots, a_n / A)$, where $a_1, \\dots, a_n$ are $\\mathbb{F}_q$-linearly independent over $A$, is the sum of $n$ terms, each equal to $1$.\n\nTherefore, the Morley rank of $p^{(n)}$ is:\n$$ \\operatorname{MR}(p^{(n)}) = n $$\nThis provides the closed-form expression in the integer $n$ as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n}$$", "id": "2987795"}, {"introduction": "Our study of types has so far been restricted to \"real\" elements and parameters from the model's home sort.

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the model-theoretic properties of a specific theory $T_2$, focusing on Elimination of Imaginaries (EI), the coding of types, and the number of realizations of a specific type.\n\nThe language is $L=\\{E\\}$, where $E$ is a binary relation. The theory $T_2$ is the complete $L$-theory stating that $E$ is an equivalence relation with infinitely many classes, each of size exactly $2$. We work in a monster model $\\mathfrak{C} \\models T_2$.\n\nA. To show that $T_{2}$ does not have Elimination of Imaginaries, we must demonstrate the failure of the given condition for the equivalence relation $E(x,y)$ itself. The condition states that there should exist a parameter-free definable function $f$ mapping elements of the home sort (reals) to a tuple of reals, such that for any $x, y$ in $\\mathfrak{C}$, $E(x,y)$ holds if and only if $f(x)=f(y)$. Let's assume such a function $f: \\mathfrak{C} \\to \\mathfrak{C}^n$ exists for some integer $n \\ge 1$.\n\nLet $C = \\{a, b\\}$ be an arbitrary equivalence class in $\\mathfrak{C}$, with $a \\ne b$. According to the definition of $f$, since $E(a,b)$ is true, we must have $f(a) = f(b)$. Let this common value be the tuple $\\bar{c}=(c_1, \\dots, c_n)$, where each $c_i \\in \\mathfrak{C}$. This tuple $\\bar{c}$ serves as a code for the class $C$.\n\nSince the function $f$ is definable without parameters, it must be preserved by any automorphism of the model. That is, for any $\\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C})$ and any $x \\in \\mathfrak{C}$, we must have $\\sigma(f(x)) = f(\\sigma(x))$. The action of $\\sigma$ on the tuple $\\bar{c}$ is component-wise: $\\sigma(\\bar{c}) = (\\sigma(c_1), \\dots, \\sigma(c_n))$.\n\nConsider an automorphism $\\tau \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C})$ that swaps the elements $a$ and $b$, so $\\tau(a)=b$ and $\\tau(b)=a$. Such an automorphism exists because $a$ and $b$ are indiscernible over the empty set (they are two elements in a two-element class in a structure with infinitely many such classes, and the theory $T_2$ has quantifier elimination).\n\nApplying the property of $f$ under this automorphism $\\tau$ to the element $a$:\n$$\n\\tau(f(a)) = f(\\tau(a))\n$$\nThe left-hand side is $\\tau(\\bar{c}) = (\\tau(c_1), \\dots, \\tau(c_n))$. The right-hand side is $f(b)$. Since $f(a)=f(b)=\\bar{c}$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\tau(\\bar{c}) = \\bar{c}\n$$\nThis means that the automorphism $\\tau$ which swaps $a$ and $b$ must fix the tuple $\\bar{c}$ component-wise. That is, for each $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, we must have $\\tau(c_j) = c_j$. This implies that none of the components $c_j$ can be equal to $a$ or $b$, since $\\tau(a)=b \\ne a$ and $\\tau(b)=a \\ne b$. Thus, for any class $C=\\{a,b\\}$, its code $\\bar{c}=f(a)$ must consist of elements external to $C$.\n\nNow, let's consider where the components $c_j$ can be located. Suppose one component, say $c_1$, belongs to a different equivalence class $C'=\\{d, e\\}$, where $C' \\ne C$. Let's assume $c_1=d$.\nThe type of $d$ over the set $\\{a, b\\}$ is the same as the type of $e$ over $\\{a, b\\}$, because any formula with parameters $a,b$ can only refer to whether an element is one of $\\{a,b\\}$ or is $E$-related to them, both of which are false for $d$ and $e$. Since $\\operatorname{tp}(d/\\{a,b\\}) = \\operatorname{tp}(e/\\{a,b\\})$, by the saturation of $\\mathfrak{C}$, there exists an automorphism $\\rho \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C})$ that fixes $a$ and $b$ pointwise and swaps $d$ and $e$, i.e., $\\rho(a)=a$, $\\rho(b)=b$, $\\rho(d)=e$, $\\rho(e)=d$.\n\nLet's apply this automorphism $\\rho$ to the equation $f(a)=\\bar{c}$.\n$$\n\\rho(f(a)) = f(\\rho(a))\n$$\nThe right-hand side is $f(a)$ since $\\rho(a)=a$. So, $\\rho(f(a)) = f(a) = \\bar{c} = (d, c_2, \\dots, c_n)$.\nThe left-hand side is $\\rho(\\bar{c}) = (\\rho(c_1), \\rho(c_2), \\dots, \\rho(c_n))$. Since $c_1=d$, $\\rho(c_1)=e$. So, the left-hand side is $(e, \\rho(c_2), \\dots, \\rho(c_n))$.\nEquating the two sides gives:\n$$\n(e, \\rho(c_2), \\dots, \\rho(c_n)) = (d, c_2, \\dots, c_n)\n$$\nComparing the first component gives $e=d$, which contradicts the fact that $d$ and $e$ are two distinct elements of the class $C'$.\nThis argument shows that no component $c_j$ of the code $\\bar{c}$ for class $C$ can belong to any other class $C'$.\n\nIn summary:\n1. The components of the code $\\bar{c}$ for a class $C=\\{a,b\\}$ cannot be $a$ or $b$.\n2. The components of $\\bar{c}$ cannot belong to any other class $C' \\ne C$.\n\nCombining these two points, we conclude that the components $c_j$ of the code tuple $\\bar{c}$ cannot belong to any equivalence class. However, the domain of the model $\\mathfrak{C}$ is the disjoint union of all equivalence classes. Every element must belong to exactly one class. This is a contradiction. The only way out would be for the tuple $\\bar{c}$ to be empty, but a function to an empty set of tuples is not well-defined in this context, nor would it distinguish between non-equivalent elements.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption must be false. There is no such parameter-free definable function $f$. Consequently, the theory $T_2$ does not have Elimination of Imaginaries.\n\nB. Let $e$ be the imaginary element from $\\mathfrak{C}^{\\mathrm{eq}}$ corresponding to the $E$-class of an element $a \\in \\mathfrak{C}$. Let this class be $C = \\{a_1, a_2\\}$. The type $p(y) = \\operatorname{tp}(y/e)$ is the complete $1$-type over $e$. The problem states its realizations are precisely the members of the class $C$.\nWe want to show that $p(y)$ cannot be coded by any tuple of real parameters $\\bar{b} \\in \\mathfrak{C}^n$. A type $\\operatorname{tp}(y/e)$ is coded by a real tuple $\\bar{b}$ if the group of automorphisms that stabilizes the type is identical to the group of automorphisms that fixes $\\bar{b}$ pointwise.\nThe stabilizer of the type $p(y)=\\operatorname{tp}(y/e)$ is the set of automorphisms that fix its parameter, $e$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Stab}(p) = \\{\\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C}) \\mid \\sigma(e)=e\\}\n$$\nThe stabilizer of the tuple $\\bar{b}$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Stab}(\\bar{b}) = \\{\\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C}) \\mid \\sigma(\\bar{b})=\\bar{b} \\text{ (pointwise)}\\}\n$$\nThe coding condition is $\\operatorname{Stab}(p) = \\operatorname{Stab}(\\bar{b})$. An automorphism $\\sigma$ fixes the class $e=C$ if and only if it maps the set $C$ to itself: $\\sigma(C)=C$.\n\nLet's assume for contradiction that such a tuple of reals $\\bar{b}$ exists.\nLet $\\tau \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C})$ be an automorphism that swaps the two elements of the class $C$, i.e., $\\tau(a_1)=a_2$ and $\\tau(a_2)=a_1$. As argued in part A, such an automorphism exists.\nSince $\\tau(C) = \\tau(\\{a_1, a_2\\}) = \\{a_2, a_1\\} = C$, $\\tau$ fixes the class $e$. Thus, $\\tau \\in \\operatorname{Stab}(p)$.\nBy the coding assumption, $\\tau$ must also be in $\\operatorname{Stab}(\\bar{b})$, meaning $\\tau$ must fix $\\bar{b}$ pointwise. So, for each component $b_i$ of $\\bar{b}$, we must have $\\tau(b_i)=b_i$.\nSince $\\tau$ moves $a_1$ and $a_2$, this implies that no component $b_i$ of $\\bar{b}$ can be equal to $a_1$ or $a_2$. In other words, the tuple $\\bar{b}$ must be disjoint from the class $C$ it is supposed to be coding.\n\nNow, consider any other class $C' = \\{d_1, d_2\\}$. There exists an automorphism $\\rho \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C})$ that swaps $d_1$ and $d_2$ but fixes $a_1$ and $a_2$ pointwise.\nSince $\\rho$ fixes $a_1$ and $a_2$, it certainly fixes their class $C$. So, $\\rho(e)=e$ and $\\rho \\in \\operatorname{Stab}(p)$.\nBy the coding assumption, $\\rho$ must also be in $\\operatorname{Stab}(\\bar{b})$, which means $\\rho$ must fix $\\bar{b}$ pointwise.\nThis means no component $b_i$ of $\\bar{b}$ can be equal to $d_1$ or $d_2$.\nThis argument applies to any arbitrary class $C'$ different from $C$.\n\nSo, the components of $\\bar{b}$ cannot lie in $C$, and they cannot lie in any other class $C'$. Since the entire universe $\\mathfrak{C}$ is the union of all such classes, the components of $\\bar{b}$ cannot be any elements of $\\mathfrak{C}$. This is only possible if $\\bar{b}$ is the empty tuple, $\\emptyset$.\n\nIf $\\bar{b} = \\emptyset$, then $\\operatorname{Stab}(\\bar{b}) = \\operatorname{Stab}(\\emptyset)$ is the entire automorphism group, $\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C})$.\nThe coding assumption would then imply $\\operatorname{Stab}(p) = \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C})$. This would mean that every automorphism of $\\mathfrak{C}$ fixes $e$.\nThis is false. As $T_2$ has infinitely many classes, we can take two distinct classes, $C$ and $C'$. There is an automorphism that maps $C$ to $C'$, and thus moves $e$. For instance, mapping the two elements of $C$ to the two elements of $C'$ can be extended to an automorphism of $\\mathfrak{C}$. This automorphism does not fix $e$.\nSo, $\\operatorname{Stab}(p) \\neq \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C})$. This contradicts the consequence of $\\bar{b}=\\emptyset$.\n\nWe have shown that $\\bar{b}$ cannot contain elements from $C$, cannot contain elements outside $C$, and cannot be the empty tuple. This exhausts all possibilities and leads to a contradiction in every case. Therefore, the type $p(y)$ cannot be coded by any tuple of real parameters.\n\nC. We need to compute the exact number of realizations of the complete type $p(y) = \\operatorname{tp}(y/e)$ in $\\mathfrak{C}$.\nLet the class named by $e$ be $C=\\{a_1, a_2\\}$. The problem text for part B states that the realizations of $p(y)$ are precisely the members of this class. The definition of the theory $T_2$ asserts that every equivalence class has size $2$. Therefore, the number of realizations is $2$.\n\nLet's formally justify the premise that the realizations are the members of the class.\nLet $p(y) = \\operatorname{tp}(a_1/e)$. A realization of this type is any element $b \\in \\mathfrak{C}$ such that $\\operatorname{tp}(b/e) = \\operatorname{tp}(a_1/e)$.\n1.  The formula $\\phi(y,e) \\equiv (y/E = e)$, which states that \"$y$ belongs to the class $e$\", is in the language of $T_2^{\\text{eq}}$. Since $a_1$ belongs to the class $e$, $\\phi(a_1,e)$ is true, so $\\phi(y,e) \\in p(y)$. Any realization $b$ of $p(y)$ must therefore satisfy $\\phi(b,e)$, meaning $b$ must belong to the class $C = \\{a_1, a_2\\}$. So, the set of realizations is a subset of $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$.\n2.  We must check if $a_2$ is also a realization. This requires showing that $\\operatorname{tp}(a_1/e) = \\operatorname{tp}(a_2/e)$. This means showing that for any formula $\\psi(y,z)$, $\\mathfrak{C} \\models \\psi(a_1,e)$ if and only if $\\mathfrak{C} \\models \\psi(a_2,e)$.\n    Consider an automorphism $\\sigma$ that swaps $a_1$ and $a_2$ (so $\\sigma(a_1)=a_2, \\sigma(a_2)=a_1$) and is the identity on elements outside of $C$ (such $\\sigma$ can be constructed). The imaginary element $e$ corresponds to the set $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$, so $\\sigma(e) = \\sigma(\\{a_1, a_2\\}) = \\{\\sigma(a_1), \\sigma(a_2)\\} = \\{a_2, a_1\\} = e$. The automorphism $\\sigma$ fixes $e$.\n    If $\\mathfrak{C} \\models \\psi(a_1,e)$, then applying the automorphism $\\sigma$ to this statement gives $\\mathfrak{C} \\models \\psi(\\sigma(a_1), \\sigma(e))$. Since $\\sigma(a_1)=a_2$ and $\\sigma(e)=e$, this becomes $\\mathfrak{C} \\models \\psi(a_2,e)$. The converse holds by applying $\\sigma^{-1} = \\sigma$.\n    Thus, $a_1$ and $a_2$ are indiscernible over $e$, which means $\\operatorname{tp}(a_1/e) = \\operatorname{tp}(a_2/e)$.\n\nCombining both points, the set of realizations of the type $p(y)$ is exactly $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$.\nThe number of realizations is the cardinality of this set, which is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2987807"}]}
