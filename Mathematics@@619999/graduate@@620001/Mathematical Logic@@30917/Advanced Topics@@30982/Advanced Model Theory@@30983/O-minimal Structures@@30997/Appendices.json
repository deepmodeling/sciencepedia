The context is that of real closed fields (RCF), where the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem guarantees the existence of such a quantifier-free formula.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- The structure is a Real Closed Field, with the language of ordered rings.\n- The parameter is $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n- The polynomials are $p(x,y) = y^{2} - (x^{2}+2)\\,y + (x^{2}-1)$ and $q(x,y) = y - x^{3}$.\n- The formula to analyze is $\\exists y \\,\\bigl( p(x,y) = 0 \\,\\wedge\\, q(x,y) > 0 \\bigr)$.\n- The task is to construct an equivalent quantifier-free formula in $x$ and to compute the discriminant $\\Delta(x)$ of $p(x,y)$ with respect to $y$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the mathematical theory of real closed fields and model theory. It is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The concepts are standard in real algebraic geometry. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution. The problem is to determine for which values of the parameter $x$ there exists a $y$ such that $y$ is a root of the polynomial $p(x,y)$ and simultaneously satisfies the inequality $q(x,y) > 0$.\n\nThe polynomial $p(x,y)$ is a quadratic in the variable $y$:\n$$\np(x,y) = y^{2} - (x^{2}+2)y + (x^{2}-1) = 0\n$$\nTo determine the nature of the roots for $y$, we first compute the discriminant, $\\Delta(x)$, of this quadratic. The coefficients, as polynomials in $x$, are $a(x) = 1$, $b(x) = -(x^{2}+2)$, and $c(x) = x^{2}-1$. The discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta(x) = b(x)^{2} - 4a(x)c(x)$.\n$$\n\\Delta(x) = \\bigl(-(x^{2}+2)\\bigr)^{2} - 4(1)(x^{2}-1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(x) = (x^{2}+2)^{2} - 4(x^{2}-1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(x) = (x^{4} + 4x^{2} + 4) - (4x^{2} - 4)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(x) = x^{4} + 4x^{2} + 4 - 4x^{2} + 4\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(x) = x^{4} + 8\n$$\nSince $x$ is a real parameter, $x^{4} \\ge 0$, and therefore $\\Delta(x) = x^{4} + 8 \\ge 8 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies that for any given value of $x$, the polynomial $p(x,y)=0$ has two distinct real roots for $y$. Let us denote these roots by $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$.\n\nThe existential formula $\\exists y \\,\\bigl( p(x,y) = 0 \\,\\wedge\\, q(x,y) > 0 \\bigr)$ is true if and only if at least one of these two roots satisfies the inequality $q(x,y) > 0$. That is, the formula is equivalent to the disjunction:\n$$\nq(x, y_1(x)) > 0 \\quad \\lor \\quad q(x, y_2(x)) > 0\n$$\nSubstituting $q(x,y) = y - x^{3}$, we get:\n$$\ny_1(x) - x^{3} > 0 \\quad \\lor \\quad y_2(x) - x^{3} > 0\n$$\nTo obtain a quantifier-free formula in the language of ordered rings, we must express this condition as a Boolean combination of polynomial equalities and inequalities in $x$ alone, without explicit reference to the roots $y_1(x)$ and $y_2(x)$, which are generally not rational functions. This can be achieved by analyzing the signs of the terms $y_1 - x^3$ and $y_2 - x^3$ using symmetric polynomials of the roots.\n\nLet $A(x) = y_1(x) - x^{3}$ and $B(x) = y_2(x) - x^{3}$. We are interested in the condition $A(x) > 0 \\lor B(x) > 0$. We consider their product $P(x) = A(x)B(x)$ and their sum $S(x) = A(x)+B(x)$. These can be expressed as polynomials in $x$ using Vieta's formulas for the roots of $p(x,y)=0$:\n$$\ny_1(x) + y_2(x) = x^{2} + 2\n$$\n$$\ny_1(x) y_2(x) = x^{2} - 1\n$$\nThe product is:\n$$\nP(x) = (y_1 - x^{3})(y_2 - x^{3}) = y_1y_2 - x^{3}(y_1+y_2) + (x^{3})^{2}\n$$\n$$\nP(x) = (x^{2}-1) - x^{3}(x^{2}+2) + x^{6} = x^{2}-1 - x^{5}-2x^{3} + x^{6}\n$$\n$$\nP(x) = x^{6} - x^{5} - 2x^{3} + x^{2} - 1\n$$\nThe sum is:\n$$\nS(x) = (y_1 - x^{3}) + (y_2 - x^{3}) = (y_1+y_2) - 2x^{3}\n$$\n$$\nS(x) = (x^{2}+2) - 2x^{3} = -2x^{3} + x^{2} + 2\n$$\nNow we analyze the condition $A(x) > 0 \\lor B(x) > 0$ based on the signs of $P(x)$ and $S(x)$.\n1. If $P(x) < 0$, then $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ have opposite signs. This means one must be positive and the other negative. Thus, the condition $A(x) > 0 \\lor B(x) > 0$ is satisfied.\n2. If $P(x) = 0$, then at least one of $A(x)$ or $B(x)$ is zero. Let's say $A(x)=0$. The condition becomes $B(x) > 0$. In this case, $S(x) = A(x)+B(x) = 0+B(x) = B(x)$. So, the condition is equivalent to $S(x) > 0$. Thus, this case is $P(x)=0 \\land S(x)>0$.\n3. If $P(x) > 0$, then $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ have the same sign (they are either both positive or both negative). For the condition $A(x) > 0 \\lor B(x) > 0$ to be true, they must both be positive. If $A(x)>0$ and $B(x)>0$, their sum $S(x)=A(x)+B(x)$ must also be positive. Conversely, if $S(x)>0$ and $P(x)>0$, it is not possible for both $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ to be negative (as their sum would be negative). Therefore, they must both be positive. This case is $P(x)>0 \\land S(x)>0$.\n\nCombining these cases, the original formula is equivalent to the following disjunction:\n$$\n\\bigl( P(x) < 0 \\bigr) \\lor \\bigl( P(x) = 0 \\land S(x) > 0 \\bigr) \\lor \\bigl( P(x) > 0 \\land S(x) > 0 \\bigr)\n$$\nThis can be simplified:\n$$\n\\bigl( P(x) < 0 \\bigr) \\lor \\bigl( (P(x) = 0 \\lor P(x) > 0) \\land S(x) > 0 \\bigr)\n$$\n$$\n\\bigl( P(x) < 0 \\bigr) \\lor \\bigl( P(x) \\ge 0 \\land S(x) > 0 \\bigr)\n$$\nThe equivalent quantifier-free formula is $P(x)  0 \\lor S(x) > 0$. Substituting the polynomials we derived:\n$$\n(x^{6} - x^{5} - 2x^{3} + x^{2} - 1  0) \\quad \\lor \\quad (-2x^{3} + x^{2} + 2  0)\n$$\nThis is the required quantifier-free formula.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to provide the discriminant $\\Delta(x)$ of $p(x,y)$ with respect to $y$. As calculated above, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta(x) = x^{4} + 8\n$$\nThis expression is the requested final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{x^{4}+8}\n$$", "id": "2978140"}, {"introduction": "The Cell Decomposition Theorem is arguably the most important structural result in o-minimality, asserting that any definable set can be partitioned into a finite number of simple, well-behaved pieces called cells.

The preimage $f^{-1}(U)$ consists of all points $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $f(x,y) = x^{2}+y^{2} \\in (0,\\infty)$.

So, $\\Phi$ must have the form $\\Phi(x,y) = (f(x,y), \\Psi(x,y))$ for some map $\\Psi: f^{-¹}(U) \\to S^{1}$.\n\nFor any $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$, the point lies on a circle of radius $r = \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}  0$. The value of the function is $f(x,y) = r^{2}$.

Let $r = \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$. Since $x^{2}+y^{2}  0$, we have $r0$. The equations become $u = x/r$ and $v = y/r$, which are equivalent to $x=ur$ and $y=vr$. The condition $r=\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$ is captured by $r^2 = x^2+y^2$ combined with $r0$.\nSo the graph $G$ is the set of $(x,y,t,u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5}$ satisfying:\n$$\n(x^{2}+y^{2}0) \\land (t=x^{2}+y^{2}) \\land \\exists r \\in \\mathbb{R} \\left( (r0) \\land (r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}) \\land (x=ur) \\land (y=vr) \\right)\n$$\nThis is a formula in the first-order language of ordered fields.

This means $t \\in (0,\\infty)$ and $(u,v) \\in S^{1}$, so $u^{2}+v^{2}=1$. We want to find a unique $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ such that $\\Phi(x,y) = (t,u,v)$.\nThe system of equations to solve is:\n1) $x^{2}+y^{2} = t$\n2) $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}} = u$\n3) $\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}} = v$\n\nFrom (1), since $t0$, we have $\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}=\\sqrt{t}$. Substituting this into (2) and (3) yields:\n$x = u\\sqrt{t}$\n$y = v\\sqrt{t}$\nThis suggests the inverse map $\\Phi^{-1}: U \\times S^{1} \\to \\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Phi^{-1}(t,u,v) = (u\\sqrt{t}, v\\sqrt{t})\n$$\nLet's verify this is the inverse. First, the image of $\\Phi^{-1}$ is in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$. Let $(x,y)=(u\\sqrt{t},v\\sqrt{t})$. Then $x^{2}+y^{2} = (u\\sqrt{t})^{2}+(v\\sqrt{t})^{2} = (u^{2}+v^{2})t = 1 \\cdot t = t$. Since $t0$, $(x,y) \\neq (0,0)$.\nNow we check the compositions:\n$\\Phi(\\Phi^{-1}(t,u,v)) = \\Phi(u\\sqrt{t}, v\\sqrt{t}) = ((u\\sqrt{t})^{2}+(v\\sqrt{t})^{2}, \\frac{u\\sqrt{t}}{\\sqrt{t}}, \\frac{v\\sqrt{t}}{\\sqrt{t}}) = (t,u,v)$.\n$\\Phi^{-1}(\\Phi(x,y)) = \\Phi^{-1}(x^{2}+y^{2}, \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}}, \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}}) = (\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}} \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}, \\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}} \\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}) = (x,y)$.\nThus, $\\Phi$ is a bijection with inverse $\\Phi^{-1}$.\n\nThe definability of $\\Phi^{-1}$ follows from a similar argument. Its graph is $\\{(t,u,v,x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{5} \\mid t0 \\land u^{2}+v^{2}=1 \\land x=u\\sqrt{t} \\land y=v\\sqrt{t}\\}$. The function $t \\mapsto \\sqrt{t}$ is definable on $(0,\\infty)$. The maps $(u,v) \\mapsto u$ and $(u,v) \\mapsto v$ are projections, hence definable. Products of definable functions are definable. Thus, a map defined by taking products of definable functions is definable. This shows $\\Phi^{-1}$ is a definable map.\n\nFinally, we prove continuity. The map $\\Phi$ is defined on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus\\{(0,0)\\}$. Its components are $x^{2}+y^{2}$, $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}}$, and $\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}}$. These are constructed from polynomials, the square root function, and division. As compositions of continuous functions on a domain where denominators are non-zero, they are all continuous. Therefore, $\\Phi$ is continuous.\nThe inverse map $\\Phi^{-1}$ is defined on $U \\times S^{1} = (0,\\infty) \\times S^{1}$. Its components are $u\\sqrt{t}$ and $v\\sqrt{t}$. The square root function is continuous on $(0,\\infty)$. The projection maps for $u$ and $v$ are continuous. Products of continuous functions are continuous. Therefore, $\\Phi^{-1}$ is continuous.\n\nSince $\\Phi$ is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse, it is a homeomorphism. We have constructed a definable homeomorphism $\\Phi: f^{-1}(U) \\to U \\times S^{1}$ such that $\\pi_1 \\circ \\Phi = f$. This is the definition of a definable trivialization of $f$ over $U$. The fiber over any point $t \\in U$, which is the set $f^{-1}(t) = \\{(x,y)|x^{2}+y^{2}=t\\}$, is mapped homeomorphically by $\\Phi$ to $\\{t\\} \\times S^{1}$, which is in turn homeomorphic to the standard fiber $S^{1}$. The existence of this trivialization over $U$ means that $f$ is a definable locally trivial fibration over $U$ with fiber $S^{1}$.\n\nThe explicit expression for the inverse trivialization $\\Phi^{-1}(t,u,v)$ is $(u\\sqrt{t}, v\\sqrt{t})$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} u\\sqrt{t}  v\\sqrt{t} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2978131"}]}
