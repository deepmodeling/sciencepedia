Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be an $L'$-structure with domain $\\mathbb{N}$ and $R^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\emptyset$. Then $R$ is explicitly definable in $\\mathcal{M}$ by the $L$-formula $\\varphi(x) \\equiv (x \\neq x)$.

The definitions of explicit definability are standard. The Beth definability theorem, which is contextually relevant, is a cornerstone of model theory.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The question is unambiguous. It asks for a specific kind of example that illustrates the difference between a property holding in a single model and a property being entailed by a theory (i.e., holding in all of its models).\n-   **Objective**: The language is formal and precise, free of subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the distinction between a statement being true in a particular model and a statement being a logical consequence of a theory.\n-   **Definability in $\\mathcal{M}$**: This is a local property. It means that within the specific universe of $\\mathcal{M}$, the interpretation of $R$, denoted $R^{\\mathcal{M}}$, coincides with the set defined by some $L$-formula $\\varphi$.\n-   **Definability over $T$**: This is a global property concerning all models of $T$. It requires the existence of a single $L$-formula $\\varphi$ that defines $R$ in *every* model of $T$. For this to hold, the theory $T$ must be strong enough to force the interpretation of $R$ to match the interpretation of $\\varphi$ in any model.\n\nAn example where definability holds in a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ but not over a theory $T$ (where $\\mathcal{M} \\models T$) must involve a theory $T$ that is not \"complete\" with respect to the properties of $R$. That is, $T$ must allow for models that are $L$-isomorphic (or even have identical $L$-reducts) but have different interpretations of $R$. This is precisely the condition that implicit definability fails, and by Beth's theorem, this implies explicit definability must also fail. The most straightforward way to achieve this is to have the axioms of $T$ not constrain $R$ at all.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this understanding.\n\n**Option A: Analysis**\n\n-   **Setup**: $L$ is the empty language (only equality, '$=$'). $L' = L \\cup \\{R\\}$ with $R$ a unary relation symbol. The theory $T$ consists of all $L$-sentences true in any infinite set; this is the theory of infinite sets, whose axioms can be given by $\\{\\exists x_1 \\dots \\exists x_k \\bigwedge_{1 \\le i < j \\le k} x_i \\neq x_j \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}, k \\ge 2\\}$. The problem specifies that $T$ is an $L'$-theory, which means its models are $L'$-structures whose $L$-reducts are models of the $L$-theory of infinite sets. The axioms themselves are $L$-sentences and thus place no constraints on $R$. The structure is $\\mathcal{M}$ with domain $\\mathbb{N}$ and $R^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\emptyset$.\n-   **Definability in $\\mathcal{M}$**: The option claims $R$ is explicitly definable in $\\mathcal{M}$ by the $L$-formula $\\varphi(x) \\equiv (x \\neq x)$. We must check if $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x (R(x) \\leftrightarrow (x \\neq x))$.\n    -   In $\\mathcal{M}$, the interpretation $R^{\\mathcal{M}}$ is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n    -   The formula $\\varphi(x) \\equiv (x \\neq x)$ defines the set $\\{a \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid a \\neq a\\}$, which is also the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n    -   Since $R^{\\mathcal{M}}$ and the set defined by $\\varphi(x)$ are identical, the equivalence $\\forall x (R(x) \\leftrightarrow (x \\neq x))$ holds true in $\\mathcal{M}$. The claim is correct.\n-   **Definability over $T$**: The option claims $R$ is not explicitly definable over $T$. To be explicitly definable over $T$, there must be some $L$-formula $\\psi(x)$ such that $T \\models \\forall x (R(x) \\leftrightarrow \\psi(x))$.\n    -   In the language $L$ of pure equality, any parameter-free formula $\\psi(x)$ with one free variable is logically equivalent to either $(x=x)$ or $(x \\neq x)$.\n    -   Case 1: Could $\\psi(x) \\equiv (x \\neq x)$ be the defining formula over $T$? If so, we would need $T \\models \\forall x (R(x) \\leftrightarrow (x \\neq x))$, which simplifies to $T \\models \\forall x (\\neg R(x))$. This would mean that in every model of $T$, the interpretation of $R$ must be the empty set. However, consider the $L'$-structure $\\mathcal{N}$ with domain $\\mathbb{N}$ and $R^{\\mathcal{N}} = \\{0\\}$. The domain is infinite, so the $L$-reduct of $\\mathcal{N}$ is a model of the theory of infinite sets. Since the axioms of $T$ do not mention $R$, $\\mathcal{N}$ is a model of $T$. In this model, $R^{\\mathcal{N}}$ is not empty. Thus, $T \\not\\models \\forall x (\\neg R(x))$.\n    -   Case 2: Could $\\psi(x) \\equiv (x=x)$ be the defining formula over $T$? If so, we would need $T \\models \\forall x (R(x) \\leftrightarrow (x=x))$, which simplifies to $T \\models \\forall x R(x)$. This would mean that in every model of $T$, the interpretation of $R$ must be the entire domain. The structure $\\mathcal{M}$ itself (with $R^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\emptyset$) is a model of $T$ where this fails. Thus, $T \\not\\models \\forall x R(x)$.\n    -   Since no possible $L$-formula works, $R$ is not explicitly definable over $T$. The reasoning in the option is correct.\n-   **Verdict**: This option correctly distinguishes the two notions and provides a valid example. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B: Analysis**\n\n-   **Claim**: \"If $T$ is any complete $L'$-theory and $R$ is explicitly definable in some single model $\\mathcal{M} \\models T$, then by the Beth definability theorem $R$ is explicitly definable over $T$.\"\n-   **Analysis**: Let's analyze the claim itself, ignoring the reference to Beth's theorem for a moment. Suppose $T$ is a complete $L'$-theory and $R$ is explicitly definable in $\\mathcal{M} \\models T$ by an $L$-formula $\\varphi(\\bar{x})$. By definition, this means $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall \\bar{x}\\,(R(\\bar{x}) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(\\bar{x}))$. The statement $\\sigma \\equiv \\forall \\bar{x}\\,(R(\\bar{x}) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(\\bar{x}))$ is an $L'$-sentence. Since $T$ is a complete theory and $\\mathcal{M}$ is one of its models, any sentence true in $\\mathcal{M}$ is entailed by $T$. Therefore, $T \\models \\sigma$. This means $T \\models \\forall \\bar{x}\\,(R(\\bar{x}) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(\\bar{x}))$, which is the definition of $R$ being explicitly definable over $T$. The claim is actually correct. However, the problem asks for an *example* where definability in a model does *not* imply definability over the theory. This option makes a claim about when this situation is impossible; it does not provide the required example.\n-   **Verdict**: This option does not satisfy the prompt's request to provide a class of examples. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C: Analysis**\n\n-   **Setup**: $L = \\{<\\}$, $L' = L \\cup \\{R\\}$. $T$ is the theory of dense linear orders without endpoints (DLO), with axioms being $L$-sentences. $\\mathcal{M} = (\\mathbb{Q}, <, R^{\\mathcal{M}})$ with $R^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n-   **Definability in $\\mathcal{M}$**: The option claims $R$ is defined by $\\varphi(x)$ asserting \"$x$ has no immediate predecessor\". In a dense linear order, every element has this property, so the set defined by $\\varphi(x)$ is the entire domain $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $R^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\mathbb{Q}$, the definition holds in $\\mathcal{M}$. This part is correct.\n-   **Reasoning and Conclusion**: The option argues: \"Since $T \\models \\forall x\\,\\varphi(x)$, it follows that $T \\models \\forall x\\,\\bigl(R(x) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(x)\\bigr)$\". This reasoning is flawed. $T \\models \\forall x\\,\\varphi(x)$ just means that in any model of DLO, the formula $\\varphi(x)$ is true for all elements. So $\\varphi(x)$ is equivalent to $(x=x)$ in any model of $T$. The purported conclusion $T \\models \\forall x\\,\\bigl(R(x) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(x)\\bigr)$ would thus be equivalent to $T \\models \\forall x R(x)$. But the theory $T$ (DLO axioms) places no constraints on $R$. We can easily construct a model of $T$, e.g., $(\\mathbb{Q}, <, \\emptyset)$, where $\\forall x R(x)$ is false. Therefore, the conclusion is incorrect. Furthermore, the option claims this is an example \"where definability in the structure implies definability over the theory but not conversely,\" which is the opposite of what the question asks for.\n-   **Verdict**: The reasoning is fallacious and the conclusion is the opposite of what was requested. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D: Analysis**\n\n-   **Setup**: $L = \\{<, c\\}$, $L' = L \\cup \\{R\\}$. $T$ is the complete $L'$-theory of $(\\mathbb{Z}, <, 0, R)$ where $c$ is interpreted as $0$ and $R(x)$ holds if and only if $x=0$. Let's call this standard structure $\\mathcal{Z}$. So $T = \\text{Th}(\\mathcal{Z})$. The model $\\mathcal{M}$ is identified as $\\mathcal{Z}$ itself.\n-   **Definability in $\\mathcal{M}$**: $R$ is claimed to be definable by the $L$-formula $\\varphi(x) \\equiv (x = c)$. In $\\mathcal{M} = \\mathcal{Z}$, $R^{\\mathcal{M}} = \\{0\\}$ and the formula $(x=c)$ defines the set $\\{0\\}$. So $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x (R(x) \\leftrightarrow x=c)$. This is correct.\n-   **Definability over $T$**: The option claims $R$ is *not* explicitly definable over $T$. This is false. As established in the analysis of option B, since $T$ is a *complete* theory and the sentence $\\sigma \\equiv \\forall x (R(x) \\leftrightarrow x=c)$ is true in its model $\\mathcal{M}$, it must be the case that $T \\models \\sigma$. Therefore, $R$ is explicitly definable over $T$ by the formula $\\varphi(x) \\equiv (x=c)$. The justification provided (\"since different models of T can permute the order while fixing c\") is irrelevant and misleading; any model of the *complete* theory $T$ will satisfy $\\forall x (R(x) \\leftrightarrow x=c)$, which fixes the interpretation of $R$ relative to $c$.\n-   **Verdict**: The main claim of this option is factually incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A is the only one that presents a correct analysis and a valid example that meets the criteria of the problem.

Thus, the formula $\\varphi(x,y)$ we are asked to construct is simply $S(x,y)$ or a formula logically equivalent to it under $T'$. The problem is a pedagogical exercise to demonstrate the constructivist nature of the proof of the Beth definability theorem. The theorem states that if a relation is implicitly definable, an explicit definition must exist. The proof via Craig's theorem shows how to find it.\n\nThe problem states that $R$ is explicitly defined, which is a stronger condition than implicit definability. Therefore, the premise for Beth's theorem is satisfied. We proceed to construct the explicit definition as requested.\n\n### Application of the Craig Interpolation Theorem\n\nThe proof of the Beth definability theorem from the Craig interpolation theorem proceeds as follows. Assume a relation symbol $R$ (of arity $n$, here $n=2$) is implicitly definable by a theory $T$ over a sub-language $L'$. This means that for any two models of $T$ that share the same $L'$-reduct, they must also agree on the interpretation of $R$.\n\nTo formalize this, we introduce a new relation symbol $R'$ of the same arity as $R$, and let $L(R')$ be the language $L$ with $R$ replaced by $R'$. Let $T(R')$ be the theory $T$ with $R$ replaced by $R'$. The implicit definability of $R$ is equivalent to the statement that the following theory is inconsistent:\n$$ T \\cup T(R') \\cup \\{\\exists x_1 \\dots \\exists x_n (R(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\land \\neg R'(x_1, \\dots, x_n))\\} $$\nBy compactness, for some tuple of new constants $\\vec{c} = (c_1, \\dots, c_n)$, this implies:\n$$ T \\cup T(R') \\cup \\{R(\\vec{c}) \\land \\neg R'(\\vec{c})\\} \\text{ is inconsistent.} $$\nThis can be rewritten as the entailment:\n$$ T \\cup T(R') \\cup \\{R(\\vec{c})\\} \\models R'(\\vec{c}) $$\nRearranging terms, we get:\n$$ T \\cup \\{R(\\vec{c})\\} \\models T(R') \\rightarrow R'(\\vec{c}) $$\nThis statement is of the form $\\psi \\models \\theta$, which is the precondition for the Craig interpolation theorem. Let's identify the components in our specific problem.\n\n1.  **The Languages**:\n    -   The language of $T$ is $L=L' \\cup \\{R\\} = \\{=, S, R\\}$.\n    -   The language of $T(R')$ is $L' \\cup \\{R'\\} = \\{=, S, R'\\}$.\n    -   We introduce two new constants, $c$ and $d$.\n    -   The antecedent is $\\psi := T \\cup \\{R(c,d)\\}$. The language of $\\psi$, $L(\\psi)$, uses the non-logical symbols $\\{S, R, c, d\\}$.\n    -   The consequent is $\\theta := T(R') \\rightarrow R'(c,d)$. The language of $\\theta$, $L(\\theta)$, uses the non-logical symbols $\\{S, R', c, d\\}$.\n    -   The common language is the language whose non-logical symbols are the intersection of the two sets: $L_{common} = L(\\psi) \\cap L(\\theta)$, which involves symbols $\\{S, c, d\\}$. So, the interpolant must be an $L'$-formula with constants $c$ and $d$.\n\n2.  **The Interpolant**:\n    According to the Craig interpolation theorem, there exists an $L'$-formula $\\varphi(c,d)$ such that:\n    (a) $\\psi \\models \\varphi(c,d)$, which is $T \\cup \\{R(c,d)\\} \\models \\varphi(c,d)$.\n    (b) $\\varphi(c,d) \\models \\theta$, which is $\\varphi(c,d) \\models (T(R') \\rightarrow R'(c,d))$.\n\n3.  **Constructing the Formula $\\varphi(c,d)$**:\n    Let's analyze the specific theories $T$ and $T(R')$ provided in the problem.\n    -   $T = T' \\cup \\{\\forall x \\,\\forall y \\,\\big(R(x,y) \\leftrightarrow S(x,y)\\big)\\}$.\n    -   $T(R') = T' \\cup \\{\\forall x \\,\\forall y \\,\\big(R'(x,y) \\leftrightarrow S(x,y)\\big)\\}$.\n\n    We need to find a formula $\\varphi(c,d)$ in the language $L' \\cup \\{c,d\\}$ satisfying (a) and (b).\n\n    Let's check condition (a): $T' \\cup \\{\\forall x, y(R \\leftrightarrow S)\\} \\cup \\{R(c,d)\\} \\models \\varphi(c,d)$.\n    In any model of the antecedent theory, $R(c,d)$ is true, and the equivalence $R(c,d) \\leftrightarrow S(c,d)$ holds. By modus ponens, $S(c,d)$ must be true. A simple candidate for the interpolant is therefore $\\varphi(c,d) := S(c,d)$. This formula is in the language $L' \\cup \\{c,d\\}$, as required.\n    With this choice, condition (a) becomes:\n    $$ T \\cup \\{R(c,d)\\} \\models S(c,d) $$\n    This is manifestly true, as argued.\n\n    Now let's check if this candidate satisfies condition (b):\n    $$ S(c,d) \\models (T' \\cup \\{\\forall x, y(R' \\leftrightarrow S)\\}) \\rightarrow R'(c,d) $$\n    To verify this entailment, we assume the antecedent, $S(c,d)$, is true, and show the consequent must be true. The consequent is an implication, so we assume its premise, $T' \\cup \\{\\forall x, y(R'(x,y) \\leftrightarrow S(x,y))\\}$, and show its conclusion, $R'(c,d)$, follows.\n    From the assumption $T' \\cup \\{\\forall x, y(R'(x,y) \\leftrightarrow S(x,y))\\}$, we can instantiate the universal quantifier to get $R'(c,d) \\leftrightarrow S(c,d)$.\n    Combined with our initial assumption that $S(c,d)$ is true, this equivalence implies that $R'(c,d)$ must also be true. Thus, condition (b) holds for $\\varphi(c,d) = S(c,d)$.\n\n    We have successfully found an interpolant $\\varphi(c,d) = S(c,d)$.\n\n4.  **Generalization**:\n    The interpolant $\\varphi(c,d)$ provides the explicit definition for the constants $c, d$. By generalizing from the new constants to variables, we obtain the defining formula $\\varphi(x,y)$.\n    From (a), we have $T \\cup \\{R(c,d)\\} \\models \\varphi(c,d)$, which generalizes to $T \\models \\forall x \\forall y(R(x,y) \\rightarrow \\varphi(x,y))$.\n    From (b), we have $\\varphi(c,d) \\cup T(R') \\models R'(c,d)$, which generalizes to $T \\models \\forall x \\forall y(\\varphi(x,y) \\rightarrow R(x,y))$.\n    Combining these, we get $T \\models \\forall x \\forall y(R(x,y) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(x,y))$.\n\n    In our case, the constructed formula is $\\varphi(x,y) := S(x,y)$.\n    So, the explicit definition is $R(x,y) \\leftrightarrow S(x,y)$, which we recover as expected.\n\n### A Note on the Problem's Phrasing\n\nThe problem statement contains a methodologically confusing instruction: \"considering the pair of theories $T' \\cup \\{R(c,d)\\}$ and $T' \\cup \\{\\neg R(c,d)\\}$\". This construction is related to Padoa's method for definability *within a theory*, but here $R$ is not in the language of $T'$. The entailments $T' \\cup \\{R(c,d)\\} \\models \\varphi(c,d)$ and $T' \\cup \\{\\neg R(c,d)\\} \\models \\neg\\varphi(c,d)$ cannot hold for any non-trivial $\\varphi$ because $T'$ places no constraints on $R$. This appears to be a misstatement. If $T'$ were replaced by $T$, the conditions would be $T \\cup \\{R(c,d)\\} \\models \\varphi(c,d)$ and $T \\cup \\{\\neg R(c,d)\\} \\models \\neg\\varphi(c,d)$. As shown, $\\varphi(c,d) = S(c,d)$ satisfies these, but this formulation does not directly involve Craig's theorem. The standard proof, which was followed above, is the one that correctly applies the interpolation theorem to derive the desired result.\n\nThe final answer is the explicit formula for $\\varphi(x,y)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{S(x,y)}$$", "id": "2969271"}, {"introduction": "Once a new symbol is shown to be definable, a natural question arises: does its addition to a theory strengthen what can be proven in the original language?

By doing so, you will gain a more refined appreciation for the fact that Beth's theorem guarantees definability *within* the new theory, which itself may contain new, non-definitional axioms about the original language.", "problem": "Let $L$ be a first-order language and $L_{R} := L \\cup \\{R\\}$ be its expansion by a single new unary predicate symbol $R$. Let $T$ be an $L$-theory and $T'$ be an $L_{R}$-theory. Recall the following definitions:\n- $T'$ is a conservative extension of $T$ (over $L$) if for every $L$-sentence $\\sigma$, if $T' \\vdash \\sigma$ then $T \\vdash \\sigma$.\n- The predicate $R$ is implicitly definable in $T'$ over $L$ if for any two models $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{2}$ of $T'$ with the same $L$-reduct, the interpretations of $R$ in $\\mathcal{M}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{M}_{2}$ agree on that common $L$-structure.

Each option names $L$, specifies $T$, and defines $T'$.\n\nA. Let $L = \\{<\\}$ be the language with a single binary relation symbol for a strict linear order. Let $T$ be the theory of linear orders (i.e., the usual axioms asserting that $<$ is irreflexive, transitive, total, and that distinct elements are comparable).

Select all that apply if more than one is correct. Your justification should proceed from the core definitions of implicit definability and conservative extension, without assuming any special model-theoretic facts beyond those definitions and the Beth definability theorem.", "solution": "The objective is to identify an option that presents a first-order language $L$, an $L$-theory $T$, and an $L_R$-theory $T'$ (where $L_R = L \\cup \\{R\\}$) satisfying two conditions simultaneously:\n(i) The unary predicate $R$ is implicitly definable in $T'$ over $L$.\n(ii) The theory $T'$ is not a conservative extension of $T$.\n\nWe will analyze each option against these two conditions.\n\nThe definition of implicit definability states that for any two models $\\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\\mathcal{M}_2$ of $T'$ that share the same $L$-reduct (i.e., the same domain and interpretation of symbols in $L$), their interpretations of $R$ must be identical ($R^{\\mathcal{M}_1} = R^{\\mathcal{M}_2}$). A sufficient condition for this is the explicit definability of $R$ within $T'$, meaning $T' \\vdash \\forall x (R(x) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(x))$ for some $L$-formula $\\varphi(x)$. If $R$ is explicitly defined, then for any $L$-structure $\\mathcal{A}$ that can be expanded to a model of $T'$, the interpretation $R^{\\mathcal{A}}$ is uniquely determined by $\\mathcal{A}$ as the set $\\{a \\in |\\mathcal{A}| \\mid \\mathcal{A} \\models \\varphi(a)\\}$. This fulfils the criterion for implicit definability.\n\nThe definition of a non-conservative extension states that there exists at least one $L$-sentence $\\sigma$ such that $T' \\vdash \\sigma$ but $T \\not\\vdash \\sigma$.\n\n### Analysis of Option A\n\n*   $L = \\{<\\}$\n*   $T = $ theory of linear orders\n*   $T' = T \\cup \\{\\exists x\\, \\forall y\\, \\lnot(y < x)\\} \\cup \\{\\forall z (R(z) \\leftrightarrow \\forall y\\, \\lnot(y < z))\\}$\n\n(i) **Implicit Definability**: The theory $T'$ contains the axiom $\\forall z (R(z) \\leftrightarrow \\forall y\\, \\lnot(y < z))$. The predicate $R(z)$ is explicitly defined using the $L$-formula $\\varphi(z) \\equiv \\forall y\\, \\lnot(y < z)$. This formula states that $z$ is a least element in the order. As explicit definability implies implicit definability, condition (i) is satisfied.\n\n(ii) **Non-Conservativity**: Let $\\sigma$ be the $L$-sentence $\\exists x\\, \\forall y\\, \\lnot(y < x)$. This sentence is an axiom of $T'$, so it is trivially the case that $T' \\vdash \\sigma$. Now we must check if $T \\vdash \\sigma$. The theory $T$ is the theory of all linear orders. There exist linear orders that do not have a least element, for instance, the integers $(\\mathbb{Z}, <)$ or the real numbers $(\\mathbb{R}, <)$. These structures are models of $T$ in which $\\sigma$ is false. By the Gödel Completeness Theorem, since there is a model of $T$ where $\\sigma$ is false ($T \\not\\models \\sigma$), it follows that $T \\not\\vdash \\sigma$. Thus, $T'$ proves an $L$-sentence that $T$ does not, which means $T'$ is not a conservative extension of $T$. Condition (ii) is satisfied.\n\n**Verdict for A**: Option A satisfies both conditions. **Correct**.\n\n### Analysis of Option B\n\n*   $L = \\{<\\}$\n*   $T = $ theory of linear orders\n*   $T' = T \\cup \\{\\forall z (R(z) \\leftrightarrow z = z)\\}$\n\n(i) **Implicit Definability**: The theory $T'$ explicitly defines $R(z)$ using the $L$-formula $\\varphi(z) \\equiv z = z$. Therefore, $R$ is implicitly definable. Condition (i) is satisfied.\n\n(ii) **Non-Conservativity**: Here, $T'$ is a *definitional extension* of $T$. It is a standard result that definitional extensions are conservative. To demonstrate this, let $\\sigma$ be an arbitrary $L$-sentence such that $T' \\vdash \\sigma$. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be any model of $T$. We can expand $\\mathcal{M}$ to an $L_R$-structure $\\mathcal{M}'$ by defining $R^{\\mathcal{M}'}$ to be the entire domain of $\\mathcal{M}$. This expansion $\\mathcal{M}'$ satisfies the axiom $\\forall z (R(z) \\leftrightarrow z=z)$ and, since its $L$-reduct is $\\mathcal{M}$, it also models $T$. Thus, $\\mathcal{M}'$ is a model of $T'$. Since $T' \\vdash \\sigma$, we must have $\\mathcal{M}' \\models \\sigma$. As $\\sigma$ is an $L$-sentence, its truth value depends only on the $L$-reduct of $\\mathcal{M}'$, which is $\\mathcal{M}$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\sigma$. Since an arbitrary model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $T$ satisfies $\\sigma$, we have $T \\models \\sigma$, and by completeness, $T \\vdash \\sigma$. This shows $T'$ is a conservative extension of $T$. Condition (ii) is not satisfied.\n\n**Verdict for B**: Option B fails condition (ii). **Incorrect**.\n\n### Analysis of Option C\n\n*   $L = \\{<\\}$\n*   $T = $ theory of linear orders\n*   $T' = T \\cup \\{\\exists u\\, \\exists v\\, (u \\neq v)\\} \\cup \\{\\exists x\\, R(x),\\;\\exists y\\, \\lnot R(y),\\;\\forall x\\,\\forall y ((y < x \\wedge R(x)) \\rightarrow R(y)),\\;\\forall x (R(x) \\rightarrow \\exists y \\,(R(y)\\wedge x<y))\\}$\n\n(i) **Implicit Definability**: The axioms for $R$ in $T'$ state that $R$ is a non-empty, proper initial segment of the order with no maximum element. To check for implicit definability, we ask: given a single underlying $L$-structure, is the interpretation of $R$ uniquely determined? Consider the $L$-structure $\\mathcal{A} = (\\mathbb{Q}, <)$, the rational numbers with their usual ordering. $\\mathcal{A}$ is a model of $T$ and of $\\exists u \\exists v (u \\neq v)$. Let's consider two possible interpretations for $R$:\n1.  $R_1 = \\{q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid q < 0\\}$. This set is non-empty, proper, an initial segment, and has no maximum. Thus, $\\mathcal{M}_1 = (\\mathcal{A}, R_1)$ is a model of $T'$.\n2.  $R_2 = \\{q \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid q < \\sqrt{2}\\}$. This set is also non-empty, proper, an initial segment, and has no maximum in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{M}_2 = (\\mathcal{A}, R_2)$ is a model of $T'$.\nThe models $\\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\\mathcal{M}_2$ have the same $L$-reduct $\\mathcal{A}$, but their interpretations of $R$ are different, since $R_1 \\neq R_2$. By definition, $R$ is not implicitly definable in $T'$. Condition (i) is not satisfied.\n\n**Verdict for C**: Option C fails condition (i). **Incorrect**.\n\n### Analysis of Option D\n\n*   $L = \\{\\cdot,^{-1},e\\}$\n*   $T = $ theory of groups\n*   $T' = T \\cup \\{\\forall z (R(z) \\leftrightarrow \\forall y\\, (z \\cdot y = y \\wedge y \\cdot z = y))\\}$\n\n(i) **Implicit Definability**: The theory $T'$ explicitly defines $R(z)$ using the $L$-formula $\\varphi(z) \\equiv \\forall y\\, (z \\cdot y = y \\wedge y \\cdot z = y)$, which defines the identity element. Therefore, $R$ is implicitly definable. Condition (i) is satisfied.\n\n(ii) **Non-Conservativity**: As in option B, $T'$ is a definitional extension of $T$. It adds no new axioms in the language $L$. For any $L$-sentence $\\sigma$, if $T' \\vdash \\sigma$, then $T \\vdash \\sigma$. The argument is identical to the one provided for option B. Therefore, $T'$ is a conservative extension of $T$. Condition (ii) is not satisfied.\n\n**Verdict for D**: Option D fails condition (ii). **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion and Explanation\n\nOnly Option A provides an example that satisfies both conditions.\n\nThe Beth Definability Theorem (BDT) states that if $R$ is implicitly definable in $T'$ over $L$, then there exists an $L$-formula $\\varphi(x)$ such that $T' \\vdash \\forall x \\big(R(x) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(x)\\big)$. This theorem connects implicit and explicit definability *within the theory $T'$*. It does not, by itself, impose any constraints on the $L$-sentences provable by $T'$.\n\nA theory $T'$ can have an implicitly (and thus explicitly) definable predicate $R$ and still fail to be conservative over $T$. This happens when $T'$ contains axioms, expressible purely in the language $L$, that are not consequences of $T$.\n\nOption A perfectly illustrates this point.\n1.  The theory is $T' = T \\cup \\{\\sigma\\} \\cup \\{\\text{definition of } R\\}$, where $\\sigma$ is the $L$-sentence $\\exists x \\forall y\\, \\lnot(y < x)$.\n2.  The predicate $R$ is explicitly defined by $\\varphi(x) \\equiv \\forall y \\lnot(y<x)$, so it is implicitly definable, and the BDT is satisfied.\n3.  The non-conservativity arises entirely from the inclusion of the $L$-sentence $\\sigma$ in $T'$. $T'$ postulates the existence of a least element, a property not all models of $T$ (linear orders) possess.\n4.  If $T'$ were a mere *definitional extension*, i.e., $T'_{def} = T \\cup \\{\\forall x(R(x) \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(x))\\}$, it would be conservative over $T$. However, the theory $T'$ from option A is strictly stronger than $T'_{def}$. The BDT ensures the existence of $\\varphi(x)$ relative to $T'$, but it does not prevent $T'$ from containing additional axioms like $\\sigma$ that strengthen the base theory $T$ with respect to $L$-sentences.\n\nIn summary, the BDT guarantees that an implicit definition can be converted to an explicit one provably in $T'$, but it does not guarantee that $T'$ is conservative over $T$. Non-conservativity is a separate issue, caused by $T'$ asserting new facts in the original language $L$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2969286"}]}
