A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the cardinality of the set of parameter-free definable unary subsets of a countable model $M$ of the theory of Dense Linear Order without endpoints ($T_{\\text{DLO}}$).\n\nThe theory $T_{\\text{DLO}}$ is defined in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{<\\}$ by the following axioms:\n1.  $\\forall x \\neg(x < x)$ (Irreflexivity)\n2.  $\\forall x \\forall y \\forall z ((x < y \\land y < z) \\to x < z)$ (Transitivity)\n3.  $\\forall x \\forall y (x < y \\lor x = y \\lor y < x)$ (Totality)\n4.  $\\forall x \\forall y (x < y \\to \\exists z (x < z \\land z < y))$ (Density)\n5.  $\\forall x \\exists y (y < x)$ (No minimal element)\n6.  $\\forall x \\exists y (x < y)$ (No maximal element)\n\nA unary subset $S \\subseteq M$ is parameter-free definable if there exists a formula $\\varphi(x)$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}=\\{<\\}$, with one free variable $x$ and no parameters, such that $S = \\{a \\in M \\mid M \\models \\varphi(a)\\}$. We need to find the cardinality of the family of all such sets, denoted $\\mathrm{Def}_{1}^{\\emptyset}(M)$.\n\nWe can solve this in two ways: first by using quantifier elimination, and second by using automorphism invariance.\n\n**Method 1: Using Quantifier Elimination**\n\nThe theory $T_{\\text{DLO}}$ is known to admit quantifier elimination. This means that any formula $\\psi(x_1, \\dots, x_k)$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}$ is equivalent in $T_{\\text{DLO}}$ to a quantifier-free formula $\\theta(x_1, \\dots, x_k)$.\n\nIn our case, we are interested in formulas $\\varphi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ and no parameters. By quantifier elimination, any such $\\varphi(x)$ is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula $\\theta(x)$. A quantifier-free formula with one free variable in the language $\\{<\\}$ can only be built from atomic formulas involving the variable $x$. The only possible atomic formulas are $x=x$ and $x<x$.\n\nThe formula $x=x$ is always true for any element $a \\in M$.\nThe formula $x<x$ is always false for any element $a \\in M$, due to the irreflexivity axiom.\n\nAny other quantifier-free formula with one free variable $x$ is a Boolean combination of these two atomic formulas (e.g., $(x=x) \\land \\neg(x<x)$). Since $x=x$ is equivalent to truth ($\\top$) and $x<x$ is equivalent to falsity ($\\bot$), any such Boolean combination will be logically equivalent to either $\\top$ or $\\bot$.\n\n-   If $\\varphi(x)$ is equivalent to a true formula (like $x=x$), then the set it defines is $\\{a \\in M \\mid M \\models \\top\\}$, which is the entire model $M$.\n-   If $\\varphi(x)$ is equivalent to a false formula (like $x<x$), then the set it defines is $\\{a \\in M \\mid M \\models \\bot\\}$, which is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\nTherefore, there are only two parameter-free definable unary subsets of $M$: the model $M$ itself and the empty set $\\emptyset$. The family of these subsets is $\\mathrm{Def}_{1}^{\\emptyset}(M) = \\{ \\emptyset, M \\}$. The cardinality of this family is $2$.\n\n**Method 2: Using Automorphism Invariance**\n\nA fundamental principle of model theory states that any set definable without parameters must be invariant under all automorphisms of the structure. That is, if $S \\subseteq M$ is a parameter-free definable set and $f: M \\to M$ is an automorphism of $M$, then $f(S) = S$.\n\nThe theory $T_{\\text{DLO}}$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical. This means all of its countable models are isomorphic. By a classic theorem of Cantor, any countable dense linear order without endpoints is isomorphic to the set of rational numbers with their usual ordering, $(\\mathbb{Q}, <)$. So we can let $M$ be $(\\mathbb{Q}, <)$ without loss of generality.\n\nThe automorphism group of $(\\mathbb{Q}, <)$, denoted $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbb{Q}, <)$, is known to act transitively on the set $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means for any two elements $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, there exists an automorphism $f \\in \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbb{Q}, <)$ such that $f(a) = b$.\n\nLet $S \\subseteq M$ be a parameter-free definable unary subset.\n-   Case 1: $S$ is non-empty. Let $a$ be an element in $S$. For any other element $b \\in M$, because $\\mathrm{Aut}(M)$ is transitive, there exists an automorphism $f: M \\to M$ such that $f(a) = b$. Since $S$ is invariant under $f$, we have $f(S)=S$. As $a \\in S$, it must be that $f(a) \\in f(S)$, so $b \\in S$. Since $b$ was an arbitrary element of $M$, it follows that $S$ must contain all elements of $M$. Thus, if $S \\neq \\emptyset$, then $S=M$.\n-   Case 2: $S$ is empty. The empty set $\\emptyset$ is always definable (e.g., by the formula $x<x$) and is trivially invariant under any automorphism ($f(\\emptyset) = \\emptyset$).\n\nCombining these cases, the only possible parameter-free definable unary subsets are $\\emptyset$ and $M$. Thus, $\\lvert\\mathrm{Def}_{1}^{\\emptyset}(M)\\rvert = 2$.\n\n**Consistency with the Ryll-Nardzewski Theorem**\n\nThe Ryll-Nardzewski (R-N) theorem states that for a complete theory $T$ with a countable language, the following are equivalent:\n1.  $T$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical.\n2.  For every natural number $n$, the group of automorphisms $\\mathrm{Aut}(M)$ of any countable model $M \\models T$ has finitely many orbits on $M^n$.\n3.  For every natural number $n$, the space of complete $n$-types over the empty set, $S_n(\\emptyset)$, is finite.\n\nWe are given that $T=T_{\\text{DLO}}$ is countably categorical. The R-N theorem connects this property to the number of types and orbits. For $n=1$, the theorem implies that $|S_1(\\emptyset)|$ is finite.\n\nThe set $S_n(\\emptyset)$ is the set of complete $n$-types over the empty set. There is a deep connection: two $n$-tuples $\\bar{a}, \\bar{b} \\in M^n$ realize the same complete type over $\\emptyset$ if and only if there exists an automorphism $f \\in \\mathrm{Aut}(M)$ such that $f(\\bar{a}) = \\bar{b}$. In other words, the number of complete $n$-types over $\\emptyset$, $\\lvert S_n(\\emptyset) \\rvert$, is precisely the number of orbits of $n$-tuples in $M^n$ under the action of $\\mathrm{Aut}(M)$.\n\nFor our problem, we consider $n=1$. We have established that $\\mathrm{Aut}(M)$ acts transitively on $M$. This means there is only one orbit of $1$-tuples (elements) in $M$. This orbit is $M$ itself. Consequently, the number of complete $1$-types over the empty set is $\\lvert S_1(\\emptyset) \\rvert = 1$.\n\nThe connection to definable sets is as follows: The set of all parameter-free definable subsets of $M^n$ forms a Boolean algebra. The atoms of this Boolean algebra are exactly the orbits of $n$-tuples under $\\mathrm{Aut}(M)$. Since $T$ is $\\aleph_0$-categorical, there are finitely many such orbits, say $k = \\lvert S_n(\\emptyset) \\rvert$. Any parameter-free definable set is a finite union of these orbits. The total number of sets in a finite Boolean algebra with $k$ atoms is $2^k$.\n\nTherefore, the number of parameter-free definable $n$-subsets is $2^{\\lvert S_n(\\emptyset) \\rvert}$.\n\nFor our case with $n=1$:\n-   The number of orbits is $\\lvert S_1(\\emptyset) \\rvert = 1$.\n-   The number of parameter-free definable unary subsets is $2^{\\lvert S_1(\\emptyset) \\rvert} = 2^1 = 2$.\n\nThis result, derived from the R-N theorem, perfectly matches our direct computation of $\\lvert\\mathrm{Def}_{1}^{\\emptyset}(M)\\rvert=2$. The two definable sets correspond to the two elements of the Boolean algebra generated by the single orbit $M$: the empty union ($\\emptyset$) and the orbit itself ($M$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2970873"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the foundational case, this problem challenges you to generalize from $1$-types to $n$-types within the theory of DLO.

It is self-contained, unambiguous, and solvable using standard techniques.\n\nThe problem asks for a classification of the complete $n$-types over the empty set $\\emptyset$ for the theory of dense linear orders without endpoints, denoted $\\mathrm{DLO}$, and for the computation of the number of such types, $f(n)$.\n\nThe theory $\\mathrm{DLO}$ is a classical example of a theory that admits quantifier elimination in the language $\\mathcal{L} = \\{<\\}$. In general, we consider the language to implicitly include equality, so we work with atomic formulas of the form $x_i < x_j$ and $x_i = x_j$. The property of quantifier elimination states that any formula $\\phi(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}$ is equivalent in $\\mathrm{DLO}$ to a quantifier-free formula $\\psi(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. A quantifier-free formula is a Boolean combination of atomic formulas.\n\nA complete $n$-type over $\\emptyset$, which we denote by $p(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, is a maximal consistent set of formulas in the variables $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ with parameters from $\\emptyset$. Because of quantifier elimination, such a type is completely determined by the atomic formulas it contains. That is, for every pair of variables $x_i$ and $x_j$ from $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$, the type $p$ must decide which of the three mutually exclusive possibilities holds: $x_i < x_j$, $x_i = x_j$, or $x_j < x_i$. The collection of all such statements for all pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \\le i, j \\le n$ must be consistent with the axioms of a linear order.\n\nThis information defines a total preorder on the set of variables $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$. A total preorder is a binary relation that is reflexive, transitive, and total (for any $x, y$, either $x \\le y$ or $y \\le x$). Such a preorder can be described combinatorially in a more structured way.\n\nFirst, we can define an equivalence relation $\\sim$ on the set of variables $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ by $x_i \\sim x_j$ if and only if the formula $x_i = x_j$ is in the type $p$. This relation partitions the set $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ into a set of equivalence classes, say $\\{C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_k\\}$, where $1 \\le k \\le n$. Within each class $C_m$, all variables are equal to each other.\n\nSecond, for any two distinct equivalence classes $C_a$ and $C_b$, the type $p$ must specify a strict ordering. Let $x_i \\in C_a$ and $x_j \\in C_b$. The type must contain either $x_i < x_j$ or $x_j < x_i$. This choice is independent of the representatives $x_i$ and $x_j$ chosen from their respective classes. This defines a strict linear order on the set of equivalence classes $\\{C_1, \\dots, C_k\\}$.\n\nTherefore, a complete $n$-type over $\\emptyset$ in the theory $\\mathrm{DLO}$ is uniquely determined by:\n1.  A partition of the set of variables $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ into $k$ non-empty subsets (the equivalence classes).\n2.  A strict linear ordering of these $k$ subsets.\n\nThis provides the classification of the complete $n$-types as requested. Now, we compute the number $f(n)$ of such types by counting these combinatorial configurations. The counting argument proceeds by summing over the possible number of equivalence classes, $k$.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of equivalence classes in the partition, where $k$ can range from $1$ (all variables are equal) to $n$ (all variables are distinct).\n\nFor a fixed integer $k$ such that $1 \\le k \\le n$:\n-   The number of ways to partition a set of $n$ distinct elements (the variables $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$) into $k$ non-empty, unordered subsets is given by the Stirling number of the second kind, denoted $S(n,k)$.\n-   For each such partition, we have $k$ subsets (the equivalence classes). The number of ways to arrange these $k$ distinct subsets in a strict linear order is given by the number of permutations of $k$ items, which is $k!$.\n\nBy the rule of product, for a fixed $k$, the number of types with exactly $k$ distinct values among the variables is $S(n,k) \\cdot k!$.\n\nTo find the total number of complete $n$-types, $f(n)$, we sum over all possible values of $k$ from $1$ to $n$:\n$$f(n) = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} S(n,k) k!$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for $f(n)$ in terms of Stirling numbers of the second kind and factorials. The numbers given by this formula are known as the ordered Bell numbers or Fubini numbers.

We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe foundational principle for this analysis is the correspondence between syntax and semantics provided by a sufficiently saturated and homogeneous model $\\mathfrak{C}$ of the theory $T_k$. For such a model, the set of complete $n$-types over the empty set, $S_n(\\emptyset)$, is in a one-to-one correspondence with the set of orbits of $n$-tuples of elements from $\\mathfrak{C}$ under the action of the model's automorphism group, $\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C})$. That is, $\\lvert S_n(\\emptyset) \\rvert = \\lvert \\mathfrak{C}^n / \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C}) \\rvert$. Our task is thus transformed into a combinatorial problem: to count the number of such orbits.\n\nAn orbit of an $n$-tuple $\\bar{b} = (b_1, \\dots, b_n)$ where each $b_i \\in \\mathfrak{C}$ is the set $\\{ \\sigma(\\bar{b}) \\mid \\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{C}) \\}$. To count the orbits, we must determine the invariant properties that characterize them. Two tuples $\\bar{b}$ and $\\bar{c}$ are in the same orbit if and only if they realize the same complete type, which means they satisfy the same formulas in the language $\\mathcal{L}$ with no parameters. The theory $T_k$ admits quantifier elimination (a standard result for this theory), which implies that any formula $\\phi(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ is equivalent to a Boolean combination of atomic formulas. The atomic formulas in the language $\\mathcal{L}$ are of the form $t_1 E t_2$, where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms. The terms are either variables $x_i$ or constants $a_l$.\n\nTherefore, the type of an $n$-tuple $(b_1, \\dots, b_n)$ is completely determined by the truth values of the following atomic formulas:\n1.  $b_i E b_j$ for all $1 \\le i, j \\le n$.\n2.  $b_i E a_l$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n$ and $1 \\le l \\le k$.\n\nLet us analyze the structural information these formulas encode.\nThe relation $E$ is an equivalence relation. The set of truth values for all formulas of the form $b_i E b_j$ thus defines an equivalence relation on the index set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, where $i$ is equivalent to $j$ if and only if $b_i E b_j$. An equivalence relation on a set is synonymous with a partition of that set into non-empty blocks (the equivalence classes). Let this partition of $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ be denoted by $P$.\n\nThe axioms of $T_k$ state that every element is $E$-equivalent to exactly one of the constants $a_1, \\dots, a_k$. This implies that for any element $b \\in \\mathfrak{C}$, there is a unique $l \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ such that $b E a_l$. This partitions the domain of $\\mathfrak{C}$ into exactly $k$ infinite equivalence classes, which we may denote by $C_l = [a_l]_E$.\nFor an $n$-tuple $(b_1, \\dots, b_n)$, if $b_i E b_j$, then $b_i$ and $b_j$ must belong to the same equivalence class $C_l$. This means that all indices within a single block of the partition $P$ must correspond to elements $b_i$ that belong to the same equivalence class of $\\mathfrak{C}$.\n\nConsequently, a complete $n$-type is uniquely specified by two pieces of combinatorial data:\n1.  A partition of the index set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into a number of non-empty blocks, say $j$ blocks.\n2.  An assignment for each of these $j$ blocks to one of the $k$ equivalence classes $\\{C_1, \\dots, C_k\\}$.\n\nWe can now enumerate all possible such configurations. The total number of $n$-types, $\\lvert S_n(\\emptyset) \\rvert$, is the sum over all possible numbers of blocks, $j$, of the number of ways to form such a structure.\n\nThe number of blocks, $j$, in a partition of the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ (with $n \\ge 1$) can range from $j=1$ (the trivial partition where all indices are in one block) to $j=n$ (the partition into singletons).\n\nFor a fixed number of blocks $j$ ($1 \\le j \\le n$), the number of ways to partition the set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ into exactly $j$ non-empty, unlabeled blocks is given by the Stirling number of the second kind, denoted $\\left\\{ {n \\atop j} \\right\\}$.\n\nFor any such partition with $j$ blocks, say $\\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_j\\}$, we must assign each block $B_m$ to one of the $k$ equivalence classes. This is equivalent to defining a function from the set of blocks $\\{B_1, \\dots, B_j\\}$ to the set of classes $\\{C_1, \\dots, C_k\\}$. Since there are $j$ blocks and $k$ classes, and the choice for each block is independent, the number of such functions is $k^j$. It is important to note that the assignment function need not be injective; multiple blocks can be mapped to the same equivalence class, which corresponds to a type realized by tuples of distinct (non-$E$-equivalent) elements that nonetheless reside in the same infinite class.\n\nTo find the total number of types, we multiply the number of ways to choose the partition by the number of ways to assign classes to its blocks, and sum over all possible values of $j$:\n$$\\lvert S_n(\\emptyset) \\rvert = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\text{Number of partitions of } \\{1,\\dots,n\\} \\text{ into } j \\text{ blocks}) \\times (\\text{Number of class assignments for } j \\text{ blocks})$$\nSubstituting the combinatorial quantities, we get:\n$$\\lvert S_n(\\emptyset) \\rvert = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left\\{ {n \\atop j} \\right\\} k^j$$\n\nThis expression is the desired closed-form analytic expression for the number of complete $n$-types over the empty set. For $n \\geq 1$, the Stirling number $\\left\\{ {n \\atop 0} \\right\\} = 0$, so the summation can equivalently be written from $j=0$:\n$$\\lvert S_n(\\emptyset) \\rvert = \\sum_{j=0}^{n} \\left\\{ {n \\atop j} \\right\\} k^j$$\nThis sum is known as the $n$-th Touchard polynomial evaluated at $k$. The finiteness of this sum for any fixed integers $n$ and $k$ is consistent with the Ryll-Nardzewski theorem, which predicts that $\\lvert S_n(\\emptyset) \\rvert$ is finite for all $n$ for any $\\aleph_0$-categorical theory like $T_k$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left\\{ {n \\atop j} \\right\\} k^j}\n$$", "id": "2970887"}]}
