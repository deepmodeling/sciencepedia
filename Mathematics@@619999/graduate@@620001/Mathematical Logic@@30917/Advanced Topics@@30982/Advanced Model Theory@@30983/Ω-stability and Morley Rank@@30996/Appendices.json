All premises are factually sound and all terms are well-defined. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe goal is to compute the Morley rank $\\mathrm{MR}(X)$ and Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(X)$ of the definable set $X = \\{(x,y) \\in K^2 : y=x^2\\}$, and the Morley rank $\\mathrm{MR}(\\pi(X))$ and Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(\\pi(X))$ of its projection $\\pi(X)$, where $\\pi(x,y)=x$. The theory is $T=\\mathrm{ACF}_0$, the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the set $X = \\{(x,y) \\in K^2 : y = x^2\\}$. This set is the graph of the polynomial function $f: K \\to K$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$. Let us consider the map $g: K \\to X$ given by $g(x) = (x, x^2)$. This map is definable in the language of rings, as its graph is the set $\\{(t, (x, y)) \\in K^3 : x=t \\land y=t^2\\}$, which is defined by polynomial equations.\n\nWe demonstrate that $g$ is a bijection between the affine line $K$ and the set $X$.\n1.  Injectivity: Suppose $g(a) = g(b)$ for some $a, b \\in K$. By definition, $(a, a^2) = (b, b^2)$. This implies $a=b$. Thus, $g$ is injective.\n2.  Surjectivity: Let $(x,y)$ be an arbitrary element of $X$. By the definition of $X$, the coordinates must satisfy the equation $y=x^2$. Therefore, $(x,y) = (x, x^2) = g(x)$. This means any element of $X$ is in the image of $g$. Thus, $g$ is surjective onto $X$.\n\nSince $g: K \\to X$ is a definable bijection, and the problem states that definable bijections preserve both Morley rank and Morley degree, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MR}(X) = \\mathrm{MR}(K)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{dM}(X) = \\mathrm{dM}(K)\n$$\nOur task thus reduces to computing the Morley rank and degree of the affine line $K$.\n\nThe theory $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ admits quantifier elimination. A known consequence of this is that any definable subset of $K$ (in one free variable) is either a finite set or a cofinite set (the complement of a finite set).\nThe Morley rank $\\mathrm{MR}(S)$ of a definable set $S$ is defined inductively. A non-empty set $S$ has $\\mathrm{MR}(S) \\ge 0$. For an integer $n \\ge 0$, $\\mathrm{MR}(S) \\ge n+1$ if there exists an infinite family of pairwise disjoint, non-empty, definable subsets $\\{S_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ of $S$, each with $\\mathrm{MR}(S_i) \\ge n$. A key property is that a definable set has Morley rank $0$ if and only if it is finite.\n\nLet's compute $\\mathrm{MR}(K)$.\n1.  The field $K$ is infinite, so $\\mathrm{MR}(K) > 0$.\n2.  To check if $\\mathrm{MR}(K) \\ge 1$, we need an infinite collection of disjoint non-empty definable subsets $\\{S_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ with $\\mathrm{MR}(S_i) \\ge 0$. We can choose $S_i = \\{c_i\\}$ for an infinite set of distinct constants $c_i \\in K$. Each $\\{c_i\\}$ is a definable set, non-empty, and has $\\mathrm{MR}(\\{c_i\\}) = 0$. This collection satisfies the condition, so $\\mathrm{MR}(K) \\ge 1$.\n3.  To check if $\\mathrm{MR}(K) \\ge 2$, we would need an infinite collection of pairwise disjoint definable subsets $\\{U_j\\}_{j \\in J}$ of $K$ where each $U_j$ has $\\mathrm{MR}(U_j) \\ge 1$. A definable subset of $K$ has Morley rank at least $1$ if and only if it is infinite. In $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$, infinite definable subsets of $K$ are precisely the cofinite sets. Let $U_1 = K \\setminus F_1$ and $U_2 = K \\setminus F_2$ be two such sets, where $F_1$ and $F_2$ are finite. Their intersection is $U_1 \\cap U_2 = K \\setminus (F_1 \\cup F_2)$. Since $F_1 \\cup F_2$ is finite, $U_1 \\cap U_2$ is cofinite and therefore non-empty. Thus, it is impossible to find even two disjoint definable subsets of $K$ both having Morley rank at least $1$.\nTherefore, $\\mathrm{MR}(K)$ cannot be greater than or equal to $2$.\nFrom these points, we conclude that $\\mathrm{MR}(K) = 1$.\n\nNext, we compute the Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(K)$. For a set $S$ with $\\mathrm{MR}(S)=n$, the Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(S)$ is the maximum integer $d$ such that $S$ can be partitioned into a disjoint union of $d$ definable subsets, each of Morley rank $n$.\nWe found $\\mathrm{MR}(K) = 1$. The Morley degree $\\mathrm{dM}(K)$ is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint definable subsets of $K$, each of rank $1$. As established, any definable subset of $K$ with rank $1$ must be infinite (cofinite), and any two such sets have a non-empty intersection. Therefore, it is impossible to partition $K$ into two or more disjoint subsets of rank $1$. The only such decomposition is the trivial one where $K$ is the single subset.\nThus, the Morley degree is $1$. So, $\\mathrm{dM}(K) = 1$.\n\nCombining these results, we find for the set $X$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MR}(X) = \\mathrm{MR}(K) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{dM}(X) = \\mathrm{dM}(K) = 1\n$$\n\nNow, we analyze the projection $\\pi(X)$. The map $\\pi: K^2 \\to K$ is given by $\\pi(x,y)=x$. The image of $X$ under $\\pi$ is the set:\n$$\n\\pi(X) = \\{x \\in K : \\exists y \\in K, (x,y) \\in X \\}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $X$:\n$$\n\\pi(X) = \\{x \\in K : \\exists y \\in K, y=x^2 \\}\n$$\nFor any element $x$ in the field $K$, its square $x^2$ is also an element of $K$. Therefore, for any $x \\in K$, there exists a $y \\in K$ (namely $y=x^2$) such that the condition is satisfied. This means that the set of such $x$ is the entire field $K$.\n$$\n\\pi(X) = K\n$$\nWe need to compute the Morley rank and degree of $\\pi(X)$, which is equivalent to computing the Morley rank and degree of $K$.

It is a well-posed problem in the field of model theory, specifically concerning the stability-theoretic properties of definable sets in the theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero, $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$. All terms are standard and the premises are mathematically sound.\n\nThe theory $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ is the complete theory of algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero, in the language of rings $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{rings}} = \\{0, 1, +, \\cdot\\}$. It is a classical result of model theory that $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ admits quantifier elimination. This implies that any definable set (with parameters) in $\\mathfrak{C}^n$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is a constructible set, i.e., a finite boolean combination of Zariski-closed sets (zero sets of polynomials).\n\nFurthermore, $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ is an $\\omega$-stable theory. For any definable set $X$ in a model of an $\\omega$-stable theory, one can define its Morley rank, $\\mathrm{MR}(X)$, and Morley degree, $\\mathrm{dM}(X)$. In $\\mathrm{ACF}_p$ (for any prime $p$ or $p=0$), the Morley rank of an algebraic variety coincides with its dimension as an algebraic variety, and its Morley degree (over a set of parameters $C$) is the number of irreducible components of maximal dimension that are defined over the algebraic closure of the field generated by $C$.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of $S$ as a strongly minimal set**\n\nA definable set is strongly minimal if it is infinite, and every definable subset of it (using any parameters from the model $\\mathfrak{C}$) is either finite or cofinite.\n\nThe set $S$ is defined by the polynomial equation $y^2 = x^3 + x$. Let $P(x,y) = y^2 - x^3 - x$. $S$ is the zero set of $P(x,y)$ in $\\mathfrak{C}^2$. The language is that of rings, so $P(x,y)$ is an $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{rings}}$-polynomial, and $S$ is a $\\emptyset$-definable set.\n\nFirst, we establish that $S$ is infinite. For almost any choice of $x \\in \\mathfrak{C}$, the polynomial $z^2 - (x^3+x)$ has two distinct roots in $\\mathfrak{C}$ because $\\mathfrak{C}$ is algebraically closed. The exceptions are when $x^3+x=0$, which occurs for only a finite number of $x$ values. Since $\\mathfrak{C}$ is infinite, there are infinitely many points $(x,y)$ satisfying the equation. Thus, $S$ is an infinite set.\n\nNext, we must show that $S$ is an irreducible algebraic curve. A curve is irreducible if its defining polynomial is irreducible. We consider $P(x,y) = y^2 - (x^3+x)$ as a polynomial in $y$ with coefficients in the ring $\\mathfrak{C}[x]$. It is a quadratic polynomial. For it to be reducible in $\\mathfrak{C}[x,y]$, it would have to factor into two polynomials of degree $1$ in $y$. This would imply that its roots for $y$, which are $\\pm\\sqrt{x^3+x}$, must be polynomials in $x$. Let's assume $\\sqrt{x^3+x} = q(x)$ for some $q(x) \\in \\mathfrak{C}[x]$. Then $x^3+x = (q(x))^2$. Taking the degree of both sides, we would have $\\deg(x^3+x) = 3$ and $\\deg((q(x))^2) = 2\\deg(q(x))$. This would require $3 = 2\\deg(q(x))$, which is impossible since the degree of a polynomial must be an integer. Therefore, $x^3+x$ is not the square of any polynomial in $\\mathfrak{C}[x]$. This proves that $P(x,y)$ is an irreducible polynomial in $\\mathfrak{C}[x,y]$.\n\nThus, $S$ is an irreducible algebraic curve. A fundamental result in the model theory of $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ is that any infinite, irreducible algebraic variety is a strongly minimal set if and only if its dimension is $1$. Since $S$ is an irreducible curve, its dimension is $1$. Therefore, $S$ is a strongly minimal set.\n\nTo justify this directly: let $D \\subseteq S$ be a definable subset. Due to quantifier elimination, $D$ can be written as $S \\cap Z$, where $Z$ is a constructible set in $\\mathfrak{C}^2$. It is sufficient to consider the case where $Z$ is a Zariski-closed set $V(f)$ defined by a single polynomial equation $f(x,y)=0$.\nThe intersection $D = S \\cap V(f)$ is the solution set of the system of equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\ny^2 - x^3 - x = 0 \\\\\nf(x,y) = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSince $S=V(P)$ is an irreducible variety, if $f$ is identically zero on $S$, then $P$ must divide $f$ (by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz), and in this case $S \\cap V(f) = S$, which is a cofinite subset of $S$ (it is $S$ itself). If $f$ is not identically zero on $S$, then $S \\cap V(f)$ is a proper subvariety of $S$. Because $S$ is an irreducible curve (dimension $1$), any proper subvariety must have a smaller dimension, which means dimension $0$. A variety of dimension $0$ is a finite set of points. So, $S \\cap V(f)$ is finite.\nSince any definable subset of $S$ is a finite boolean combination of sets of the form $S \\cap V(f)$, it must be either finite or cofinite. This confirms that $S$ is a strongly minimal set. As a consequence, $\\mathrm{MR}(S)=1$ and $\\mathrm{dM}(S)=1$.\n\n**Part 2: Morley Ranks and Degrees of Subsets**\n\nThe parameter set is $A = \\{i, \\sqrt{2}\\}$. The definable field generated by $A$, $\\mathrm{dcl}(A)$, is $\\mathbb{Q}(i, \\sqrt{2})$.\n- $A_1 := \\{p \\in S : x(p) \\neq 0\\}$: This is the set $S$ minus the points where $x=0$. If $x=0$, then $y^2 = 0^3+0=0$, so $y=0$. Thus, $A_1 = S \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$. Since $S$ is strongly minimal and $\\{(0,0)\\}$ is a finite set, $A_1$ is a cofinite subset of $S$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{MR}(A_1) = \\mathrm{MR}(S)=1$ and $\\mathrm{dM}_A(A_1)=1$.\n\n- $A_2 := \\{p \\in S : y(p) \\neq 0\\}$: This is $S$ minus the points where $y=0$. If $y=0$, then $x^3+x=0$, which is $x(x^2+1)=0$. The solutions are $x=0$, $x=i$, and $x=-i$. The points are $(0,0)$, $(i,0)$, and $(-i,0)$. Thus, $A_2 = S \\setminus \\{(0,0), (i,0), (-i,0)\\}$. This is a cofinite subset of $S$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{MR}(A_2) = \\mathrm{MR}(S)=1$ and $\\mathrm{dM}_A(A_2)=1$. The parameters $i$ and $-i$ are in $\\mathrm{dcl}(A)$.\n\n- $A_3 := \\{p \\in S : x(p) = 1\\}$: This set consists of points on $S$ with $x=1$. We have $y^2 = 1^3+1=2$, so $y=\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The set is $A_3 = \\{(1, \\sqrt{2}), (1, -\\sqrt{2})\\}$. This is a finite set of two points. A non-empty finite set has Morley rank $0$. The Morley degree of a rank $0$ set is its cardinality, provided each point is an irreducible component definable over the parameter set. The coordinate $\\sqrt{2}$ is in $A$. Thus, both points are definable over $A$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{MR}(A_3)=0$ and $\\mathrm{dM}_A(A_3)=2$.\n\n- $A_1 \\cap A_2$: This is the set of points in $S$ where $x(p) \\neq 0$ and $y(p) \\neq 0$. This is $S \\setminus \\left( \\{p \\in S : x(p)=0\\} \\cup \\{p \\in S : y(p)=0\\} \\right) = S \\setminus \\{(0,0), (i,0), (-i,0)\\}$. This is precisely the set $A_2$. So $\\mathrm{MR}(A_1 \\cap A_2)=1$ and $\\mathrm{dM}_A(A_1 \\cap A_2)=1$.\n\n- $A_1 \\cup A_2$: This is the set of points in $S$ where $x(p) \\neq 0$ or $y(p) \\neq 0$. This is the complement of the set where $x(p)=0$ and $y(p)=0$, which is the single point $(0,0)$. So $A_1 \\cup A_2 = S \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$, which is $A_1$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{MR}(A_1 \\cup A_2)=1$ and $\\mathrm{dM}_A(A_1 \\cup A_2)=1$.\n\n- $A_2 \\cap A_3$: The points in $A_3$ are $(1, \\sqrt{2})$ and $(1, -\\sqrt{2})$. For both points, the $y$-coordinate is non-zero. Thus, both points are contained in $A_2$. So $A_3 \\subseteq A_2$, which implies $A_2 \\cap A_3 = A_3$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{MR}(A_2 \\cap A_3) = \\mathrm{MR}(A_3)=0$ and $\\mathrm{dM}_A(A_2 \\cap A_3) = \\mathrm{dM}_A(A_3)=2$.\n\n- $A_2 \\cup A_3$: Since $A_3 \\subseteq A_2$, their union is $A_2$. So $A_2 \\cup A_3 = A_2$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{MR}(A_2 \\cup A_3) = \\mathrm{MR}(A_2)=1$ and $\\mathrm{dM}_A(A_2 \\cup A_3) = \\mathrm{dM}_A(A_2)=1$.\n\n**Part 3: Morley Rank and Degree of D**\n\nThe set $D$ is defined as $D := \\big(S \\cap \\{x=1\\}\\big) \\cup \\big(S \\cap \\{y=0\\}\\big)$. This is the intersection of the irreducible curve $S$ with the reducible curve defined by the equation $(x-1)y=0$. Since the defining polynomial of $S$ does not divide $(x-1)y$, the intersection must be a variety of dimension $0$, i.e., a finite set of points.\n\nWe compute the points in each part of the union:\n1.  $D_1 := S \\cap \\{x=1\\}$: This is the set $A_3$ from Part 2. It consists of the points $\\{(1, \\sqrt{2}), (1, -\\sqrt{2})\\}$.\n2.  $D_2 := S \\cap \\{y=0\\}$: These are the points excluded from $S$ to form $A_2$. The points are $\\{(0,0), (i,0), (-i,0)\\}$.\n\nThe set $D$ is the union $D_1 \\cup D_2$. The $x$-coordinates in $D_1$ are all $1$. The $x$-coordinates in $D_2$ are $0, i, -i$. The sets are disjoint.\nSo, $D = \\{(1, \\sqrt{2}), (1, -\\sqrt{2}), (0,0), (i,0), (-i,0)\\}$.\nThis is a finite set containing $5$ distinct points. Any non-empty finite set has Morley rank $0$.\nSo, $\\mathrm{MR}(D) = 0$.\n\nThe Morley degree of a set of rank $0$ over a parameter set $A$, $\\mathrm{dM}_A(D)$, is the number of points in $D$, provided each point is definable over $A$. A point $(a,b)$ is definable over $A$ if its coordinates $a,b$ are in the definable closure of $A$, which in $\\mathrm{ACF}_0$ is the field generated by $A$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, i.e., $\\mathbb{Q}(A) = \\mathbb{Q}(i, \\sqrt{2})$.\n\nLet's check the coordinates of the 5 points in $D$:\n- $(1, \\sqrt{2})$: Coordinates $1, \\sqrt{2}$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(i, \\sqrt{2})$.\n- $(1, -\\sqrt{2})$: Coordinates $1, -\\sqrt{2}$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(i, \\sqrt{2})$.\n- $(0,0)$: Coordinates $0,0$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(i, \\sqrt{2})$.\n- $(i,0)$: Coordinates $i,0$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(i, \\sqrt{2})$.\n- $(-i,0)$: Coordinates $-i,0$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(i, \\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince all 5 points are definable over $A$, the set $D$ decomposes into 5 irreducible components of rank $0$. Therefore, the Morley degree of $D$ over $A$ is $5$.\n$\\mathrm{dM}_A(D) = 5$.\n\nThe problem asks for the Morley degree of $D$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "2988713"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice challenges you to compute the rank of a set defined not by a simple equation, but through a more complex logical formula involving existential quantifiers.

It is a well-established fact that ACF$_0$ is $\\omega$-stable. In fact, it is uncountably categorical, which implies $\\omega$-stability. A key property of ACF$_0$ is that it admits quantifier elimination in the language $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{field}}=\\{0,1,+,\\cdot\\}$. The Morley rank of $K^m$ for a model $K$ is $\\mathrm{MR}(K^m)=m$.\n\nThe theory $T$ is an expansion of $T_0$ by a new unary predicate symbol $P$. The axiom for $P$ is $\\forall x\\,(P(x)\\leftrightarrow x\\neq 0)$. The formula $x\\neq 0$ is a quantifier-free formula in the original language $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{field}}$. This means that the new symbol $P$ is explicitly defined by a formula in the base theory $T_0$. Such an expansion is called an expansion by definitions.\n\nAn expansion by definitions of an $\\omega$-stable theory is itself $\\omega$-stable. To see this, note that any formula $\\phi$ in the expanded language $\\mathcal{L}$ can be translated into an equivalent formula $\\phi'$ in the original language $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{field}}$ by replacing every occurrence of $P(t)$ with $t\\neq 0$. Since $T_0$ is $\\omega$-stable, for any countable set of parameters $A$, the set of complete types over $A$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{field}}$ is countable. As every $\\mathcal{L}$-formula is equivalent to an $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{field}}$-formula, the number of types does not increase, and thus the set of complete $\\mathcal{L}$-types over $A$ is also countable. Therefore, $T$ is $\\omega$-stable.\n\nNext, we justify that $P(K)=K^{\\times}$ (the set of non-zero elements of the field $K$) is strongly minimal. A definable set $D$ is strongly minimal if every definable subset of $D$ is either finite or cofinite in $D$. In the context of ACF, which has quantifier elimination, a definable subset of $K$ is a finite Boolean combination of sets defined by polynomial equations of the form $f(x)=0$. Any such set is either finite or cofinite in $K$. This property is known as $K$ being a strongly minimal set.\n\nLet $S$ be an arbitrary $\\mathcal{L}$-definable subset of $P(K)=K^{\\times}$. Since any $\\mathcal{L}$-formula is equivalent to an $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{field}}$-formula, $S$ is also an $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{field}}$-definable subset of $K^{\\times}$. Thus, $S = D \\cap K^{\\times}$ for some $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{field}}$-definable subset $D \\subseteq K$. As established, since $K$ is strongly minimal, $D$ is either finite or cofinite in $K$.\n\nCase 1: $D$ is finite.\nIn this case, $S = D \\cap K^{\\times}$ is a subset of a finite set, and is therefore finite.\n\nCase 2: $D$ is cofinite in $K$.\nThis means that the complement of $D$ in $K$, denoted $D^c = K \\setminus D$, is a finite set. We want to show that $S$ is cofinite in $K^{\\times}$, which means its complement in $K^{\\times}$, $(K^{\\times})^c_S = K^{\\times} \\setminus S$, must be finite.\nWe have $(K^{\\times})^c_S = K^{\\times} \\setminus (D \\cap K^{\\times})$. By set-theoretic rules, this is equivalent to $K^{\\times} \\cap (D \\cap K^{\\times})^c = K^{\\times} \\cap (D^c \\cup (K^{\\times})^c) = K^{\\times} \\cap (D^c \\cup \\{0\\})$.\nThis simplifies to $(K^{\\times} \\cap D^c) \\cup (K^{\\times} \\cap \\{0\\})$. The second term is the empty set. The first term, $K^{\\times} \\cap D^c$, is a subset of the finite set $D^c$, and is therefore finite.\nThus, $(K^{\\times})^c_S$ is finite, which implies $S$ is cofinite in $K^{\\times}$.\n\nSince any definable subset of $P(K)$ is either finite or cofinite in $P(K)$, the set $P(K)$ is strongly minimal.\n\n### Part 2: Morley Rank of $X_n$\n\nThe set $X_n \\subseteq K^{n+1}$ is defined for $n \\ge 1$ by the formula\n$$ \\varphi_{n}(x_{1},\\dots,x_{n},z)\\;:\\;\\exists y_{1}\\dots \\exists y_{n}\\left(\\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n}\\big(P(y_{i})\\wedge y_{i}^{2}=x_{i}\\big)\\wedge z=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\\right). $$\nA tuple $(x_1, \\dots, x_n, z)$ belongs to $X_n$ if and only if:\n1. For each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, there exists a $y_i \\in K$ such that $P(y_i)$ (i.e., $y_i \\neq 0$) and $y_i^2 = x_i$. This implies that each $x_i$ must be non-zero, as $y_i=0$ would imply $x_i=0$, but $P(0)$ is false. For any non-zero $x_i$ in an algebraically closed field, there are exactly two such $y_i$, namely the two distinct square roots of $x_i$.\n2. The value $z$ is the sum of such $y_i$'s, i.e., $z = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i$.\n\nFor a given tuple $(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ with each $x_i \\ne 0$, let $\\sqrt{x_i}$ denote one fixed choice of a square root. Then any $y_i$ satisfying $y_i^2=x_i$ must be of the form $\\epsilon_i \\sqrt{x_i}$ for $\\epsilon_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$. The condition on $z$ is that $z$ must be expressible as a sum $z = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\epsilon_i \\sqrt{x_i}$ for some choice of signs $(\\epsilon_1, \\dots, \\epsilon_n) \\in \\{+1, -1\\}^n$.\n\nThis means that for a fixed $(x_1, \\dots, x_n) \\in (K^\\times)^n$, $z$ must be a root of the polynomial\n$$ P_{\\mathbf{x}}(z) = \\prod_{(\\epsilon_1, \\dots, \\epsilon_n) \\in \\{+1, -1\\}^n} \\left( z - \\sum_{i=1}^n \\epsilon_i \\sqrt{x_i} \\right) = 0. $$\nAlthough the coefficients of this polynomial appear to involve the terms $\\sqrt{x_i}$, the entire polynomial is invariant under the substitution of any $\\sqrt{x_i}$ with $-\\sqrt{x_i}$, as this action merely permutes the roots. By Galois theory, any such polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in $z$ and the elementary symmetric polynomials of $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$. More directly, it is a polynomial in variables $z, x_1, \\dots, x_n$. Let's call this polynomial $P(x_1, \\dots, x_n, z)$. For $n=2$, this polynomial is $(z^2 - x_1 - x_2)^2 - 4x_1x_2 = 0$.\n\nThe set $X_n$ is therefore described by the conditions:\n$$ X_n = \\left\\{ (x_1, \\dots, x_n, z) \\in K^{n+1} \\mid \\bigwedge_{i=1}^n (x_i \\neq 0) \\wedge P(x_1, \\dots, x_n, z) = 0 \\right\\}. $$\nThis shows that $X_n$ is a constructible set in $K^{n+1}$. Specifically, it is the intersection of the Zariski open set $U = (K^\\times)^n \\times K$ and the Zariski closed set $V = \\{(\\mathbf{x},z) \\in K^{n+1} \\mid P(\\mathbf{x},z)=0\\}$.\n\nIn an algebraically closed field, the Morley rank of a constructible set is equal to its algebraic dimension. The dimension of $X_n$ is the dimension of its Zariski closure, $\\overline{X_n}$. The closure of $X_n$ in $K^{n+1}$ is the variety $V$ (assuming $P$ is irreducible, or taking the highest-dimensional component if not).\nThe variety $V$ is defined by a single non-trivial polynomial equation $P(\\mathbf{x}, z)=0$ in the affine space $K^{n+1}$. A set defined by one non-zero polynomial equation in a space of dimension $m$ is called a hypersurface and has dimension $m-1$. Here, the ambient space is $K^{n+1}$, which has dimension $n+1$. The polynomial $P$ is not identically zero, because for a generic choice of $x_i$, the $2^n$ possible values for $z$ are distinct. Therefore, $V$ is a hypersurface.\n\nThe dimension of $V$ is $\\dim(V) = (n+1) - 1 = n$.\nSince $\\mathrm{MR}(X_n) = \\dim(X_n) = \\dim(\\overline{X_n}) = \\dim(V)$, we have\n$$ \\mathrm{MR}(X_n) = n. $$\n\nAlternatively, we can use the additivity property of Morley rank. Let $\\pi: X_n \\to (K^\\times)^n$ be the projection map $\\pi(x_1, \\dots, x_n, z) = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$. The image of $\\pi$ is exactly $(K^\\times)^n$. The Morley rank of the image is $\\mathrm{MR}((K^\\times)^n) = n$, since $\\mathrm{MR}(K^\\times)=1$.\nFor any point $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ in the image, the fiber $\\pi^{-1}(\\mathbf{x})$ is the set $\\{ \\mathbf{x} \\} \\times S_{\\mathbf{x}}$, where $S_{\\mathbf{x}}$ is the set of possible values for $z$. This set is finite, with size at most $2^n$. The Morley rank of a non-empty finite set is $0$.\nThe Morley rank of a definable set can be calculated from a definable map onto a base space. For a map $f: A \\to B$, if the rank of fibers $f^{-1}(b)$ is constant, say $k$, for all $b$ in a \"large\" subset of $B$, then $\\mathrm{MR}(A) = \\mathrm{MR}(B) + k$.\nHere, the map is $\\pi: X_n \\to (K^\\times)^n$. The fibers are all finite, so their Morley rank is $k=0$.\n$$ \\mathrm{MR}(X_n) = \\mathrm{MR}((K^\\times)^n) + \\sup_{\\mathbf{x} \\in (K^\\times)^n} \\mathrm{MR}(\\pi^{-1}(\\mathbf{x})) = n + 0 = n. $$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The Morley rank of the set $X_n$ is $n$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n}\n$$", "id": "2988711"}]}
