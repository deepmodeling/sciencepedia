The theory of algebraically closed fields (ACF) is a well-known example of a stable theory.

This question effectively probes this understanding.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The problem is verifiable within the framework of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), the standard foundation for modern mathematics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the definitions of consistency and dividing.\n-   **Consistency of a type**: A complete type $p(x)$ over a set $B$, denoted $p \\in S(B)$, is consistent if and only if it is realized in the monster model $\\mathfrak{C}$. By definition, for any element $a \\in \\mathfrak{C}$ and any set $B \\subset \\mathfrak{C}$, the type $\\operatorname{tp}(a/B) = \\{\\varphi(x,b) : b \\in B, \\mathfrak{C} \\models \\varphi(a,b)\\}$ is a consistent complete type over $B$.\n-   **Dividing of a formula**: A formula $\\varphi(x,b)$ divides over $A$ if there is an $A$-indiscernible sequence $(b_i)_{i\\omega}$ with $b_0=b$ such that the set of formulas $\\{\\varphi(x, b_i) : i\\omega\\}$ is inconsistent.\n\nThe question asks for an example of a consistent type $p(x)$ that contains a formula $\\varphi(x,b)$ that divides over some set $A$. Let's construct such an example.\n\nLet $T$ be a stable theory. Let $A$ be a set of parameters. Let $b$ be an element such that its type over $A$, $\\operatorname{tp}(b/A)$, is non-algebraic. In a stable theory, this implies that there exists an infinite $A$-indiscernible sequence of distinct elements $(b_i)_{i\\omega}$ starting with $b_0=b$, where each $b_i$ realizes $\\operatorname{tp}(b/A)$. Such a sequence is known as a Morley sequence for $\\operatorname{tp}(b/A)$.\n\nConsider the formula $\\varphi(x,b)$ defined as $x=b$.\nLet's check if this formula divides over $A$. We use the Morley sequence $(b_i)_{i\\omega}$ described above, where all $b_i$ are distinct. The set of formulas to check for inconsistency is $\\{\\varphi(x,b_i) : i\\omega\\} = \\{x=b_i : i\\omega\\}$.\nIs this set inconsistent? Yes. Take any two distinct formulas from this set, for instance, $x=b_i$ and $x=b_j$ where $i \\neq j$. Their conjunction $(x=b_i) \\land (x=b_j)$ implies $b_i=b_j$. But since the elements of the sequence are distinct, $b_i \\neq b_j$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the set is $2$-inconsistent. This satisfies the definition, so the formula $x=b$ divides over $A$.\n\nNow, we need a consistent complete type that contains this formula. Consider the element $b$ itself. Its type over the set $Ab = A \\cup \\{b\\}$ is $p(x)=\\operatorname{tp}(b/Ab)$. This type is consistent by definition, as it is realized by the element $b$. Does this type contain the formula $x=b$? Yes, because $b$ satisfies $x=b$, so $(x=b) \\in \\operatorname{tp}(b/Ab)$.\n\nSo, we have found a consistent type, $p(x)=\\operatorname{tp}(b/Ab)$, which contains a formula, $x=b$, that divides over $A$.\nThe key is that the inconsistency in the definition of dividing applies to the set $\\{\\varphi(x,b_i)\\}_{i\\omega}$, not to the type $p(x)=\\operatorname{tp}(b/Ab)$ which contains only the single instance $\\varphi(x,b_0)$. There is no logical contradiction. A type that contains a dividing/forking formula is called a forking type (or more accurately, a forking extension). The existence of consistent forking types is a cornerstone of stability theory.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options with this framework.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Work in the theory of algebraically closed fields (ACF) of characteristic $0$. Let $A$ be an algebraically closed subfield of $\\mathfrak{C}$ and let $b$ be transcendental over $A$. Consider the complete type $p(x)=\\operatorname{tp}(x/Ab)$, which contains the formula $\\varphi(x,b)$ asserting $x=b$. Because $\\operatorname{tp}(b/A)$ is non-algebraic and $T$ is stable, there exists an $A$-indiscernible Morley sequence $(b_i)_{i\\omega}$ in $\\operatorname{tp}(b/A)$ with $b_0=b$ and all $b_i$ pairwise distinct. Then $\\{x=b_i: i\\omega\\}$ is $2$-inconsistent, so $\\varphi(x,b)$ divides over $A$. The type $p(x)$ is nevertheless consistent, since it is realized by $x=b$ in $\\mathfrak{C}$. This does not contradict consistency because dividing (and hence forking) over $A$ is a property of how the formula behaves relative to $A$ across an indiscernible sequence, not of the single instance $x=b$; in stable theories, a consistent type may fork over $A$.**\n\n-   The setup is correct: ACF is a stable (in fact, $\\omega$-stable) theory. Let $A$ be an algebraically closed subfield and $b$ be transcendental over $A$. Then $\\operatorname{tp}(b/A)$ is non-algebraic.\n-   The chosen type $p(x)=\\operatorname{tp}(b/Ab)$ is consistent (realized by $b$) and contains the formula $x=b$.\n-   The argument for dividing is correct: Since $\\operatorname{tp}(b/A)$ is non-algebraic in a stable theory, there exists an $A$-indiscernible Morley sequence $(b_i)_{i\\omega}$ of distinct elements. The set $\\{x=b_i : i\\omega\\}$ is $2$-inconsistent, so $x=b$ divides over $A$.\n-   The explanation is excellent and captures the essence of the matter. It correctly distinguishes the inconsistency of the set $\\{\\varphi(x,b_i) : i\\omega\\}$ from the consistency of the type containing the single formula $\\varphi(x,b)$. It correctly notes that a consistent type can indeed be a forking type.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Work in ACF of characteristic $0$. Let $A$ be a subfield and let $b$ be transcendental over $A$. Consider the complete type $p(x)=\\operatorname{tp}(x/Ab)$, and let $\\psi(x,b)$ be the formula $x\\neq b$. For any $A$-indiscernible sequence $(b_i)_{i\\omega}$ with $b_0=b$, the set $\\{x\\neq b_i : i\\omega\\}$ is inconsistent, so $\\psi(x,b)$ divides over $A$. The type $p(x)$ is still consistent because it is realized in $\\mathfrak{C}$, which shows dividing does not imply inconsistency.**\n\n-   The claim that the set $\\{x\\neq b_i : i\\omega\\}$ is inconsistent is false. Let $(b_i)_{i\\omega}$ be an $A$-indiscernible sequence of distinct elements. The set of formulas $\\{x \\neq b_0, x \\neq b_1, x \\neq b_2, \\dots \\}$ is a consistent set of formulas in the theory of algebraically closed fields. Since the monster model $\\mathfrak{C}$ is an algebraically closed field of large cardinality, and the set $\\{b_i\\}_{i\\omega}$ is countable, we can always find an element $c \\in \\mathfrak{C}$ such that $c \\neq b_i$ for all $i  \\omega$. For instance, any element transcendental over the field generated by $A \\cup \\{b_i: i\\omega\\}$ would work. Such an element $c$ realizes the set of formulas. Since the set is consistent, the formula $x \\neq b$ does not divide over $A$.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In any stable theory $T$, if a formula $\\varphi(x,b)$ divides over $A$ and a type $p(x)$ contains $\\varphi(x,b)$, then $p(x)$ is inconsistent. Therefore, no consistent type in a stable theory can contain a dividing formula, and the situation described cannot occur.**\n\n-   This statement is a fundamental misunderstanding of forking and dividing. As demonstrated in the analysis for option A, a consistent type can contain a formula that divides over a base set. Such a type is simply a forking extension of its restriction to the base set. Forking is a measure of dependence, not a statement of inconsistency. The entire purpose of forking calculus in stability theory is to study and classify consistent types based on their dependence properties. This option claims the central object of study is impossible.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Work in ACF of characteristic $0$. Let $A$ be an algebraically closed subfield and let $b\\in\\operatorname{acl}(A)$ be algebraic over $A$. Consider the complete type $p(x)=\\operatorname{tp}(x/Ab)$, which contains the formula $\\varphi(x,b)$ asserting $x=b$. Since one can repeat $b$ in an $A$-indiscernible sequence $(b_i)_{i\\omega}$ with $b_i=b$ for all $i$, the set $\\{x=b_i : i\\omega\\}$ is inconsistent, so $\\varphi(x,b)$ divides over $A$. Nonetheless $p(x)$ is consistent because it is realized by $x=b$ in $\\mathfrak{C}$.**\n\n-   The setup specifies that $A$ is an algebraically closed subfield and $b \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A)$. For an algebraically closed field $A$, its algebraic closure is itself, so $\\operatorname{acl}(A)=A$. This means $b \\in A$.\n-   If $b \\in A$, then for any $A$-indiscernible sequence $(b_i)_{i\\omega}$ starting with $b_0=b$, it must be that $b_i=b$ for all $i  \\omega$. This is because the formula $y=b$ has parameters from $A$, and it is true for $b_0$, so it must be true for all $b_i$.\n-   The argument claims that the resulting set of formulas, $\\{x=b_i : i\\omega\\} = \\{x=b, x=b, \\dots\\}$, is inconsistent. This is false. This set contains only one distinct formula, $x=b$, which is perfectly consistent. It is not $k$-inconsistent for any $k \\ge 1$.\n-   Therefore, under the conditions stated in this option ($b \\in A$), the formula $x=b$ does not divide over $A$. The premise of the argument is false.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A provides a correct example and a precise, accurate explanation that correctly identifies the relationship between consistency, dividing, and forking.

We will proceed by using the foundational properties of $U$-rank and its relationship with forking in stable theories.\n\nA fundamental property of the $U$-rank in any theory is its additivity, often referred to as the Lascar inequality or additivity formula. For any elements $b, c$ and any parameter set $C$, the rank of the pair $(b, c)$ is given by:\n$$U(b c / C) = U(b / C) + U(c / C b)$$\nWe can apply this formula inductively to the tuple $(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ over the parameter set $A$.

The problem states that the theory $T$ is stable. In a stable theory, the concepts of forking and dividing coincide. A crucial theorem of stability theory relates forking to the behavior of the $U$-rank. Specifically, for any sets $B \\subseteq C$, a type $\\operatorname{tp}(c/C)$ is a non-forking extension of its restriction $\\operatorname{tp}(c/B)$ if and only if the $U$-rank is preserved, i.e., $U(c/C) = U(c/B)$.\n\nThe problem provides that the tuple $(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$ is independent over $A$, which is defined as: for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the type $\\operatorname{tp}(a_i / A a_1 \\dots a_{i-1})$ does not fork over $A$.\nApplying the aforementioned theorem with $c = a_i$, $B = A$, and $C = A a_1 \\dots a_{i-1}$, the non-forking condition implies:\n$$U(a_i / A a_1 \\dots a_{i-1}) = U(a_i / A)$$\nfor each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nSubstituting this result into our sum formula for the $U$-rank of the tuple, we get:\n$$U(a_1 \\dots a_n / A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} U(a_i / A)$$\nThis verifies the relationship mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nFinally, we must compute the value of this expression. This requires us to determine the value of $U(a_i / A)$ for each $i$. We are given that each $a_i$ is an element of a definable set $D$ which is strongly minimal. A set is strongly minimal if every definable subset of it (in any elementary extension) is either finite or cofinite.

For a strongly minimal set $D$, forking has a simple characterization in terms of algebraic closure. For an element $c \\in D$ and parameter sets $A \\subseteq B$, the type $\\operatorname{tp}(c/B)$ forks over $A$ if and only if $c \\in \\operatorname{acl}(B)$ and $c \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A)$.\n    From this, the Lascar $U$-rank of a type $\\operatorname{tp}(c/A)$ for $c \\in D$ is determined as follows:\n    - If $c \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A)$, then $\\operatorname{tp}(c/A)$ is the unique non-algebraic $1$-type in $D$ over $A$. Any forking extension must be over a set $B \\supset A$ where $c \\in \\operatorname{acl}(B)$, making the new type algebraic. The rank of an algebraic type is $0$.

We are given $a_{2} \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A)$. Therefore, $a_{2} \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1})$. Since $a_{2} \\in D$, this means $U(a_{2}/A a_{1}) = 1$. The stated condition \"$a_2$ is independent from $A$\" is equivalent to $a_2 \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A)$ in this context, reinforcing this conclusion.\n\n3.  **$U(a_{3}/A a_{1} a_{2})$**: We have $a_{1} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A) \\subseteq \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{2})$, so $\\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2}) = \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{2})$. The problem states $a_{3} \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{2})$. Consequently, $a_{3} \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2})$. As $a_{3} \\in D$, this yields $U(a_{3}/A a_{1} a_{2}) = 1$.\n\n4.  **$U(a_{4}/A a_{1} a_{2} a_{3})$**: We are given $a_{4} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2})$. By the monotonicity of algebraic closure, $\\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2}) \\subseteq \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2} a_{3})$. Thus, $a_{4} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2} a_{3})$. This implies $U(a_{4}/A a_{1} a_{2} a_{3}) = 0$.\n\n5.  **$U(a_{5}/A a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} a_{4})$**: We are given $a_{5} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{3})$. Since $\\{A, a_{3}\\} \\subseteq \\{A, a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}\\}$, it follows that $\\operatorname{acl}(A a_{3}) \\subseteq \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} a_{4})$. Therefore, $a_{5} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} a_{4})$, which means $U(a_{5}/A a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} a_{4}) = 0$.\n\nSumming these values, we get:\n$$U(\\bar{a}/A) = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2$$\n\n**Part II: Justification via Pregeometry Dimension**\n\nThe problem asks to show this value agrees with the dimension of $\\operatorname{acl}(A \\bar{a})$ over $\\operatorname{acl}(A)$. In the pregeometry on $D$, this dimension is $\\dim(\\bar{a}/A)$, the size of a basis for the set $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_5\\}$ over $A$. We find a basis by iteratively selecting elements that are independent of the previously selected ones and the base set $A$.\n\nLet $B$ be a basis for $\\{a_{1}, \\dots, a_{5}\\}$ over $A$. We initialize $B = \\emptyset$.\n- **Element $a_{1}$**: Is $a_{1} \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A)$? No, we are given $a_{1} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A)$. So $a_{1}$ is not in the basis.\n- **Element $a_{2}$**: Is $a_{2} \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A)$? Yes. So we add $a_{2}$ to our basis. $B=\\{a_{2}\\}$.\n- **Element $a_{3}$**: Is $a_{3} \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A \\cup B) = \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{2})$? Yes, this is given. So we add $a_{3}$ to our basis. $B=\\{a_{2}, a_{3}\\}$.\n- **Element $a_{4}$**: Is $a_{4} \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A \\cup B) = \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{2} a_{3})$? We are given $a_{4} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2})$. Since $a_{1} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A)$, $\\operatorname{acl}(A a_{1} a_{2}) = \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{2})$. So $a_{4} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{2})$, which means $a_{4}$ is algebraically dependent on $A \\cup \\{a_{2}\\}$. It is therefore also dependent on $A \\cup \\{a_{2}, a_{3}\\}$. So $a_{4}$ is not in the basis.\n- **Element $a_{5}$**: Is $a_{5} \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(A \\cup B) = \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{2} a_{3})$? We are given $a_{5} \\in \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{3})$. Since $\\operatorname{acl}(A a_{3}) \\subseteq \\operatorname{acl}(A a_{2} a_{3})$, $a_{5}$ is dependent on $A \\cup \\{a_{2}, a_{3}\\}$. So $a_{5}$ is not in the basis.\n\nThe constructed basis is $B=\\{a_{2}, a_{3}\\}$, and its cardinality is $2$. Thus, the dimension is:\n$$\\dim(\\bar{a}/A) = |B| = 2$$\nThis value matches the computed $U$-rank.\n\nFinally, we justify from first principles why these two quantities must be equal. For any tuple $\\bar{c}=(c_1, \\dots, c_n)$ of elements from $D$ and any parameter set $C \\subseteq D$, we have $U(\\bar{c}/C) = \\dim(\\bar{c}/C)$.\nLet $k = \\dim(\\bar{c}/C)$, and let $\\{b_1, \\dots, b_k\\}$ be a basis for $\\bar{c}$ over $C$.\nBy definition of a basis, $\\bar{c} \\subseteq \\operatorname{acl}(C \\cup \\{b_1, \\dots, b_k\\})$. Also, since each $b_i$ is one of the $c_j$, the basis $\\{b_1, \\dots, b_k\\}$ is contained in $\\operatorname{acl}(C\\bar{c})$. This means the tuples $\\bar{c}$ and $(b_1, \\dots, b_k)$ are interalgebraic over $C$. In a stable theory, interalgebraic types have the same $U$-rank.\n$$U(\\bar{c}/C) = U(b_1 \\dots b_k / C)$$\nUsing the chain rule for $U$-rank:\n$$U(b_1 \\dots b_k / C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} U(b_i / C b_1 \\dots b_{i-1})$$\nBy the definition of a basis, $b_i$ is independent over $C \\cup \\{b_1, \\dots, b_{i-1}\\}$, i.e., $b_i \\notin \\operatorname{acl}(C b_1 \\dots b_{i-1})$. Since $b_i \\in D$, this implies $U(b_i / C b_1 \\dots b_{i-1}) = 1$ for each $i=1, \\dots, k$.\nTherefore,\n$$U(\\bar{c}/C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 1 = k = \\dim(\\bar{c}/C)$$\nThis general result confirms that our calculation of $U(\\bar{a}/A)$ must necessarily agree with the dimension of the pregeometry, $\\dim(\\bar{a}/A)$. Both are equal to $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "2983586"}]}
