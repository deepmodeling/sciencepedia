The truth value is determined using Łoś's Theorem, which states that a sentence is true in an ultraproduct if and only if it is true in the constituent structures on a set of indices belonging to the ultrafilter.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{M} = \\prod_{n \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_n/\\mathcal{U}$ be the ultraproduct in question, where $I = \\mathbb{N}$, $\\mathcal{M}_n$ is the field $\\mathbb{Z}/p_n\\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\mathcal{U}$ is a nonprincipal ultrafilter on $I$. The language is $\\mathcal{L} = \\{0, 1, +, \\cdot\\}$. The sentence is $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists x \\ (x + x = 1)$.\n\nAccording to Łoś's Theorem, the statement $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi$ is true if and only if the set $S = \\{n \\in I \\mid \\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\varphi\\}$ is an element of the ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$, i.e., $S \\in \\mathcal{U}$.\n\nOur first step is to explicitly identify the set $S$. A structure $\\mathcal{M}_n$ models $\\varphi$ if there exists an element in its universe, $\\mathbb{Z}/p_n\\mathbb{Z}$, that satisfies the formula $x+x=1$. This can be written as the equation $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_n}$.\n\nFor this linear congruence to have a solution for $x$ in $\\mathbb{Z}/p_n\\mathbb{Z}$, the element $2$ must have a multiplicative inverse in $\\mathbb{Z}/p_n\\mathbb{Z}$. An element $a$ in the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ has a multiplicative inverse if and only if $\\gcd(a, m) = 1$. In our case, $a=2$ and $m=p_n$, where $p_n$ is the $n$-th prime number.\n\nThus, the condition for $\\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\varphi$ is that $2$ has a multiplicative inverse in $\\mathbb{Z}/p_n\\mathbb{Z}$, which is equivalent to $\\gcd(2, p_n) = 1$.\n\nSince $p_n$ is a prime number, its only positive divisors are $1$ and $p_n$. Therefore, $\\gcd(2, p_n)$ can only be $1$ or $2$.\nThe case $\\gcd(2, p_n) = 2$ occurs if and only if $p_n$ is a multiple of $2$. As $p_n$ is prime, this implies $p_n = 2$.\nThe case $\\gcd(2, p_n) = 1$ occurs if and only if $p_n$ is not a multiple of $2$, which means $p_n$ is any prime other than $2$.\n\nThe enumeration of primes is given as $p_1=2, p_2=3, p_3=5, \\dots$.\nThe condition $p_n = 2$ corresponds to the index $n=1$.\nFor $n=1$, we have $p_1=2$. The field is $\\mathcal{M}_1 = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The equation $2x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ becomes $0 \\cdot x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, or $0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, which is false. Thus, there is no solution for $x$ in $\\mathcal{M}_1$, and $\\mathcal{M}_1 \\not\\models \\varphi$.\n\nFor all indices $n > 1$, the prime $p_n$ is an odd prime ($p_2=3, p_3=5, \\dots$). For these primes, $\\gcd(2, p_n)=1$. Therefore, $2$ is an invertible element in the field $\\mathbb{Z}/p_n\\mathbb{Z}$ for all $n > 1$. The equation $2x=1$ has a unique solution, namely $x = 2^{-1}$. Consequently, for all $n > 1$, the sentence $\\varphi$ is true in $\\mathcal{M}_n$. That is, $\\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\varphi$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $n > 1$.\n\nSo, the set $S$ of indices $n$ for which $\\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\varphi$ is:\n$$S = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid n > 1\\} = \\{2, 3, 4, \\dots\\}$$\n\nThe second step is to determine if this set $S$ is in the ultrafilter $\\mathcal{U}$. We are given that $\\mathcal{U}$ is a nonprincipal ultrafilter on the set of natural numbers $I = \\mathbb{N}$. A key property of a nonprincipal ultrafilter on an infinite set like $\\mathbb{N}$ is that it contains all cofinite sets and no finite sets. A set is cofinite if its complement is finite.\n\nLet's consider the complement of $S$ in $I$:\n$$I \\setminus S = \\mathbb{N} \\setminus \\{2, 3, 4, \\dots\\} = \\{1\\}$$\nThe set $I \\setminus S$ is a finite set, as it contains only one element. Since $\\mathcal{U}$ is a nonprincipal ultrafilter, it does not contain any finite sets. Therefore, $I \\setminus S \\notin \\mathcal{U}$.\n\nBy the definition of an ultrafilter, for any subset $A \\subseteq I$, exactly one of $A$ or its complement $I \\setminus A$ must be in $\\mathcal{U}$. Since we have established that $I \\setminus S \\notin \\mathcal{U}$, it must be that its complement, $S$, is in $\\mathcal{U}$.\n$$S = \\{2, 3, 4, \\dots\\} \\in \\mathcal{U}$$\n\nSince $S = \\{n \\in I \\mid \\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\varphi\\} \\in \\mathcal{U}$, by Łoś's Theorem, the sentence $\\varphi$ is true in the ultraproduct $\\mathcal{M}$.\n$$\\prod_{n \\in I} \\mathcal{M}_n/\\mathcal{U} \\models \\varphi$$\nThe problem requires reporting the truth value as $1$ for true and $0$ for false.

The sentence $\\varphi$ is $P(c)$. In any given structure $\\mathcal{A}_{n}$, the statement $\\mathcal{A}_{n} \\models P(c)$ is true if and only if the interpretation of the constant $c$, denoted $c^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}}$, is an element of the set that interprets the predicate $P$, denoted $P^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}}$. That is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{n} \\models \\varphi \\iff c^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}} \\in P^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}}\n$$\nThe problem defines the interpretations as follows:\n- The domain is $A_{n} = \\{0, 1\\}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n- The predicate interpretation is $P^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}} = \\{0\\}$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n- The constant interpretation is $c^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}} = 0$ if $n$ is odd, and $c^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}} = 1$ if $n$ is even.\n\nWe evaluate the condition $c^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}} \\in P^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}}$ based on the parity of $n$:\n- If $n$ is an odd number: $c^{\\mathcal{A}_{n}} = 0$.

The condition becomes $1 \\in \\{0\\}$, which is false. Thus, $\\mathcal{A}_{n} \\not\\models \\varphi$ for all even $n$.\n\nTherefore, the set of natural numbers $n$ for which $\\mathcal{A}_{n}$ models $\\varphi$ is precisely the set of all odd natural numbers.

According to Łoś's theorem, $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{odd}} \\models \\varphi$ if and only if $S_{\\varphi} \\in U_{\\mathrm{odd}}$.\nWe found that $S_{\\varphi} = \\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{odd}}$. The problem states that $U_{\\mathrm{odd}}$ is a nonprincipal ultrafilter on $\\mathbb{N}$ that contains the set of odd numbers. By this definition, $\\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{odd}} \\in U_{\\mathrm{odd}}$.\nTherefore, we conclude that $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{odd}} \\models \\varphi$. The corresponding numerical value is $1$.\n\nCase 2: The ultraproduct $\\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{A}_{n} / U_{\\mathrm{even}}$.\nLet $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{even}} = \\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{A}_{n} / U_{\\mathrm{even}}$. According to Łoś's theorem, $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{even}} \\models \\varphi$ if and only if $S_{\\varphi} \\in U_{\\mathrm{even}}$.\nAgain, $S_{\\varphi} = \\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{odd}}$. The problem states that $U_{\\mathrm{even}}$ is a nonprincipal ultrafilter on $\\mathbb{N}$ that contains the set of even numbers, which we denote by $\\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{even}}$. So, by definition, $\\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{even}} \\in U_{\\mathrm{even}}$.\nOne of the fundamental properties of an ultrafilter $U$ on a set $I$ is that for any subset $A \\subseteq I$, either $A \\in U$ or its complement $I \\setminus A \\in U$, but not both (since their intersection is the empty set, which is not in any filter).\nIn our context, the set is $\\mathbb{N}$, and the two relevant subsets are $\\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{odd}}$ and its complement $\\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{even}}$. Since we are given that $\\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{even}} \\in U_{\\mathrm{even}}$, its complement $\\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{odd}}$ cannot be in $U_{\\mathrm{even}}$.\nThus, $S_{\\varphi} = \\mathbb{N}_{\\mathrm{odd}} \\notin U_{\\mathrm{even}}$.\nTherefore, we conclude that $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{even}} \\not\\models \\varphi$. The corresponding numerical value is $0$.\n\nCombining the results, the truth value for $\\varphi$ in $\\prod_{n} \\mathcal{A}_{n} / U_{\\mathrm{odd}}$ is $1$, and in $\\prod_{n} \\mathcal{A}_{n} / U_{\\mathrm{even}}$ is $0$.

The structures $\\mathcal{M}_n$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ have the domain $|\\mathcal{M}_n| = \\{0, 1\\}$ and the interpretation of $P$ is given by $P^{\\mathcal{M}_n} = \\{1\\}$ if $n \\in S$ and $P^{\\mathcal{M}_n} = \\emptyset$ if $n \\notin S$, where $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ is an infinite set with an infinite complement.\n\n#### Analysis in the Ultraproduct $\\prod_{\\mathcal{U}} \\mathcal{M}_{n}$\n\nWe are asked to determine if $\\prod_{\\mathcal{U}} \\mathcal{M}_{n} \\models \\varphi$, where $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists x\\, P(x)$. The primary tool for this analysis is Łoś’s theorem.\n\nŁoś's theorem states that for any $\\mathcal{L}$-formula $\\psi(v_1, \\ldots, v_k)$ and any elements $a_1, \\ldots, a_k$ from the ultraproduct $\\prod_{\\mathcal{U}} \\mathcal{M}_{n}$, we have\n$$\n\\prod_{\\mathcal{U}} \\mathcal{M}_{n} \\models \\psi[a_1, \\ldots, a_k] \\iff \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\psi[(a_1)_n, \\ldots, (a_k)_n] \\} \\in \\mathcal{U}.\n$$\nSince $\\varphi$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables), the theorem simplifies to:\n$$\n\\prod_{\\mathcal{U}} \\mathcal{M}_{n} \\models \\varphi \\iff \\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\varphi \\} \\in \\mathcal{U}.\n$$\nTo apply this, we must first determine the set of indices $n$ for which $\\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\varphi$. The sentence $\\varphi$ is $\\exists x\\, P(x)$. An individual structure $\\mathcal{M}_n$ satisfies $\\varphi$ if and only if there exists an element $b \\in |\\mathcal{M}_n|$ such that $b \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}_n}$. In other words, $\\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\exists x\\, P(x)$ if and only if the interpretation $P^{\\mathcal{M}_n}$ is a non-empty set.\n\nAccording to the problem definition:\n- If $n \\in S$, then $P^{\\mathcal{M}_n} = \\{1\\}$. This set is non-empty.\n- If $n \\notin S$, then $P^{\\mathcal{M}_n} = \\emptyset$. This set is empty.\n\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\varphi$ if and only if $n \\in S$. The set of indices for which $\\varphi$ holds is precisely the set $S$.\n$$\n\\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\mid \\mathcal{M}_n \\models \\varphi \\} = S.\n$$\nApplying Łoś's theorem, we find that $\\prod_{\\mathcal{U}} \\mathcal{M}_{n} \\models \\varphi$ if and only if $S \\in \\mathcal{U}$. The problem statement explicitly provides that $S \\in \\mathcal{U}$.\n\nConclusion for the ultraproduct: $\\prod_{\\mathcal{U}} \\mathcal{M}_{n} \\models \\exists x\\, P(x)$ is **true**.\n\n#### Analysis in the Direct Product $\\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{M}_{n}$\n\nNext, we determine if $\\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{M}_{n} \\models \\varphi$. Let us denote the direct product structure by $\\mathcal{P} = \\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{M}_{n}$.\nThe domain of $\\mathcal{P}$ is the Cartesian product of the individual domains:\n$$\n|\\mathcal{P}| = \\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} |\\mathcal{M}_n| = \\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\{0, 1\\}.\n$$\nAn element $a \\in |\\mathcal{P}|$ is a sequence $a = (a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ where each $a_n \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nThe sentence $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists x\\, P(x)$ is true in $\\mathcal{P}$ if there exists an element $a \\in |\\mathcal{P}|$ such that $\\mathcal{P} \\models P(a)$. The satisfaction of an atomic formula like $P(a)$ in a direct product is defined component-wise:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P} \\models P(a) \\iff \\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\mathcal{M}_n \\models P(a_n).\n$$\nThe condition $\\mathcal{M}_n \\models P(a_n)$ is equivalent to $a_n \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}_n}$.\nSo, for an element $a = (a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ to satisfy $P$ in the product structure $\\mathcal{P}$, its components must satisfy $a_n \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}_n}$ for **all** $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe problem states that the complement of $S$, denoted $\\mathbb{N} \\setminus S$, is an infinite set. Since it is non-empty, there must exist at least one index $n_0 \\in \\mathbb{N} \\setminus S$. For any such $n_0$, the interpretation of $P$ in the structure $\\mathcal{M}_{n_0}$ is $P^{\\mathcal{M}_{n_0}} = \\emptyset$.\n\nFor an element $a=(a_n)_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ to exist such that $\\mathcal{P} \\models P(a)$, it must be the case that $a_{n_0} \\in P^{\\mathcal{M}_{n_0}}$ for our chosen $n_0$. This requires $a_{n_0} \\in \\emptyset$, which is impossible.\nSince this condition fails for at least one component (in fact, for infinitely many components), there is no sequence $a \\in |\\mathcal{P}|$ that can satisfy the predicate $P$. The interpretation of $P$ in the direct product, $P^{\\mathcal{P}}$, is the empty set.\n\nConsequently, the statement $\\exists x\\, P(x)$, which asserts the existence of an element satisfying $P$, must be false in the direct product.\n\nConclusion for the direct product: $\\prod_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mathcal{M}_{n} \\models \\exists x\\, P(x)$ is **false**. This illustrates a fundamental difference between direct products and ultraproducts.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of the Gödel Number\n\nThe second task is to compute the Gödel number for the sentence $\\varphi \\equiv \\exists x\\, P(x)$. The problem specifies the formula is to be treated as the sequence of symbols $\\exists, x, P, (, x, )$. Let us denote this sequence by $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4, \\sigma_5, \\sigma_6)$.\n\nThe Gödel number $G$ is defined by the formula:\n$$\nG = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} p_{i}^{e_{i}},\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of symbols in the sequence, $p_i$ is the $i$-th prime number, and $e_i$ is the numerical code for the $i$-th symbol $\\sigma_i$.\n\nThe sequence has length $k=6$. The first $6$ prime numbers are:\n$p_1 = 2$\n$p_2 = 3$\n$p_3 = 5$\n$p_4 = 7$\n$p_5 = 11$\n$p_6 = 13$\n\nThe symbol codes $e_i$ are given in the problem statement. We list them for our sequence:\n- $\\sigma_1 = \\exists \\implies e_1 = 31$\n- $\\sigma_2 = x \\implies e_2 = 53$\n- $\\sigma_3 = P \\implies e_3 = 41$\n- $\\sigma_4 = ( \\implies e_4 = 43$\n- $\\sigma_5 = x \\implies e_5 = 53$\n- $\\sigma_6 = ) \\implies e_6 = 47$\n\nWe now substitute these values into the formula for $G$:\n$$\nG = p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot p_3^{e_3} \\cdot p_4^{e_4} \\cdot p_5^{e_5} \\cdot p_6^{e_6}\n$$\n$$\nG = 2^{31} \\cdot 3^{53} \\cdot 5^{41} \\cdot 7^{43} \\cdot 11^{53} \\cdot 13^{47}\n$$\nThis is the exact, closed-form expression for the Gödel number of $\\varphi$ under the given scheme.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2^{31} \\cdot 3^{53} \\cdot 5^{41} \\cdot 7^{43} \\cdot 11^{53} \\cdot 13^{47}}\n$$", "id": "2973045"}]}
