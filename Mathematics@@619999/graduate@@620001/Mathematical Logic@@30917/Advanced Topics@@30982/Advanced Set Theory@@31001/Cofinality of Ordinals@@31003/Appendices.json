We will solve this by establishing an upper bound and a matching lower bound on $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega)$, based on the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we recall the givens: $\\omega$ is the first infinite ordinal, $\\omega_1$ is the first uncountable ordinal, the cofinality $\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha)$ is the least order type of a cofinal subset of $\\alpha$, and for a limit ordinal $\\beta$, the product $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ can be expressed as the supremum of the preceding products: $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta = \\sup_{\\gamma  \\beta} (\\alpha \\cdot \\gamma)$. For the specific case of $\\beta = \\omega$, this becomes $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega = \\sup_{n \\in \\omega} (\\omega_1 \\cdot n)$. An element $\\gamma \\in \\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$ can be uniquely written in the form $\\gamma = \\omega_1 \\cdot n + \\delta$ for some $n \\in \\omega$ and some ordinal $\\delta  \\omega_1$.\n\nThe determination of $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega)$ proceeds in two parts: establishing an upper bound and a lower bound.\n\n**1. Upper Bound for $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega)$**\n\nTo establish an upper bound on the cofinality, we must construct a cofinal sequence in $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$. The order type of this sequence will be greater than or equal to the cofinality. Let us consider the sequence $S$ defined as:\n$$S = (\\omega_1 \\cdot n)_{n \\in \\omega} = (\\omega_1 \\cdot 0, \\omega_1 \\cdot 1, \\omega_1 \\cdot 2, \\dots)$$\nThis is a sequence indexed by the ordinal $\\omega$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $S$ is a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals. For any two natural numbers $n, m \\in \\omega$ such that $n  m$, we have $m = n+k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then, by the properties of ordinal arithmetic, since $\\omega_1  0$:\n$$\\omega_1 \\cdot m = \\omega_1 \\cdot (n+k) = \\omega_1 \\cdot n + \\omega_1 \\cdot k  \\omega_1 \\cdot n$$\nThus, the sequence $S$ is strictly increasing.\n\nNext, we verify that $S$ is cofinal in $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$. A sequence is cofinal if for any element $\\gamma  \\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$, there is an element in the sequence that is greater than or equal to $\\gamma$. Let $\\gamma$ be an arbitrary ordinal such that $\\gamma  \\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$. By the definition of ordinal multiplication and the structure of $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$, $\\gamma$ can be uniquely represented as $\\gamma = \\omega_1 \\cdot n + \\delta$ for some $n \\in \\omega$ and some $\\delta  \\omega_1$.\n\nConsider the element $\\omega_1 \\cdot (n+1)$ from the sequence $S$. We have:\n$$\\omega_1 \\cdot (n+1) = \\omega_1 \\cdot n + \\omega_1$$\nSince $\\delta  \\omega_1$, it follows directly from ordinal addition that:\n$$\\gamma = \\omega_1 \\cdot n + \\delta  \\omega_1 \\cdot n + \\omega_1 = \\omega_1 \\cdot (n+1)$$\nThis shows that for any $\\gamma \\in \\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$, we have found an element in the sequence $S$, namely $\\omega_1 \\cdot (n+1)$, that is strictly greater than $\\gamma$. Therefore, the sequence $S$ is cofinal in $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$.\n\nThe sequence $S$ is indexed by $\\omega$, so its order type is $\\omega$. Since $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega)$ is the *least* order type of a cofinal sequence, we have established the upper bound:\n$$\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega) \\le \\omega$$\n\n**2. Lower Bound for $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega)$**\n\nTo establish a lower bound, we must show that no cofinal sequence of order type smaller than $\\omega$ can exist. Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a cofinal sequence of finite order type. Let $\\kappa = \\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega)$, and assume $\\kappa  \\omega$. This means $\\kappa$ is a natural number, say $\\kappa = k$ for some $k \\in \\omega$.\n\nIf $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega) = k$, there exists a strictly increasing sequence $(\\gamma_i)_{i  k}$, i.e., $\\gamma_0  \\gamma_1  \\dots  \\gamma_{k-1}$, which is cofinal in $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$. By the definition of cofinality, for any ordinal $\\beta  \\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$, there must exist an $i  k$ such that $\\beta \\le \\gamma_i$. This implies that every element in $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$ is bounded by some element in this finite sequence. In particular, every element is bounded by the maximum element, $\\gamma_{k-1}$.\nThis means that $\\sup_{\\beta  \\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega} \\beta \\le \\gamma_{k-1}$. The supremum of all ordinals less than a limit ordinal is the ordinal itself. Thus:\n$$\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega \\le \\gamma_{k-1}$$\nHowever, $\\gamma_{k-1}$ is an element of the sequence which is a subset of $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$, so it must be that $\\gamma_{k-1}  \\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$.\nThis leads to the contradiction $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega \\le \\gamma_{k-1}  \\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$.\n\nThe assumption that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega)$ is finite must be false. Therefore, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega)$ must be an infinite ordinal. The smallest infinite ordinal (and cardinal) is $\\omega$.\nHence, we have established the lower bound:\n$$\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega) \\ge \\omega$$\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds derived above, we have $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega) \\le \\omega$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega) \\ge \\omega$. This proves conclusively that:\n$$\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega) = \\omega$$\n\n**4. Interaction with Regularity of $\\omega_1$ and Non-Commutativity**\n\nThe ordinal $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$ can be visualized as $\\omega$ blocks laid end-to-end, with each block having the order type $\\omega_1$. An element $\\gamma = \\omega_1 \\cdot n + \\delta$ is in the $n$-th block. To find a cofinal sequence, one needs to \"climb\" this infinite ladder of blocks. The sequence $(\\omega_1 \\cdot n)_{n \\in \\omega}$ achieves this by jumping to the start of each successive block. The length of this sequence is determined by the number of blocks, which is $\\omega$.\n\nThe regularity of $\\omega_1$ (i.e., $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1) = \\omega_1$) is a crucial property asserting that no sequence of countable length whose elements are all less than $\\omega_1$ can have a supremum equal to $\\omega_1$. In the context of $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$, this regularity solidifies the \"indivisibility\" of each block by a countable process. A countable sequence cannot \"exhaust\" a single $\\omega_1$-block. Therefore, for a countable sequence to be cofinal in the entire product $\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega$, it *must* eventually enter blocks with arbitrarily large index $n$. This forces the sequence of block indices to be unbounded in $\\omega$. Any such sequence must have order type at least $\\omega$, which reinforces our lower bound. The cofinality of the product is thus determined by the cofinality of the right-hand factor, $\\omega$.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with left-multiplication by $\\omega$. Consider the ordinal $\\omega \\cdot \\omega_1$. This corresponds to an $\\omega_1$-sequence of blocks, each of type $\\omega$. An element is of the form $\\omega \\cdot \\alpha + n$ with $\\alpha  \\omega_1$ and $n  \\omega$. A sequence $(\\gamma_\\xi)_{\\xi  \\kappa}$ is cofinal in $\\omega \\cdot \\omega_1$ only if the sequence of its block indices $(\\alpha_\\xi)_{\\xi  \\kappa}$ is cofinal in $\\omega_1$. Because $\\omega_1$ is regular, its cofinality is $\\omega_1$. Thus, any cofinal sequence of block indices must have length at least $\\omega_1$. This implies $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega \\cdot \\omega_1) \\ge \\omega_1$. The sequence $(\\omega \\cdot \\alpha)_{\\alpha  \\omega_1}$ is a cofinal sequence of length $\\omega_1$, showing $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega \\cdot \\omega_1) \\le \\omega_1$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega \\cdot \\omega_1) = \\omega_1$.\n\nThe results $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega_1 \\cdot \\omega) = \\omega$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega \\cdot \\omega_1) = \\omega_1$ powerfully illustrate that ordinal multiplication is not commutative. The cofinality of a product $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ where $\\beta$ is a limit ordinal is determined by $\\operatorname{cf}(\\beta)$, not $\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\omega}\n$$", "id": "2970145"}, {"introduction": "The epsilon numbers represent a critical class of ordinals defined as fixed points of exponentiation.

No rounding is required and no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The problem asks for a four-part proof leading to the computation of the cofinality of the ordinal $\\epsilon_0$. We will address each part in sequence.\n\nFirst, we justify that the function $f(\\beta)=\\omega^{\\beta}$ is a normal function, which requires showing it is strictly increasing and continuous at limit ordinals.\nTo show $f$ is strictly increasing, we must prove that for any ordinals $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, if $\\beta  \\gamma$, then $\\omega^{\\beta}  \\omega^{\\gamma}$. We proceed by transfinite induction on $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta$ be an arbitrary ordinal.\n- Base case: $\\gamma=0$. The condition $\\beta  0$ is impossible, so the statement holds vacuously.\n- Successor case: Assume $\\gamma = \\delta+1$. If $\\beta  \\delta+1$, then either $\\beta=\\delta$ or $\\beta\\delta$.\n    - If $\\beta=\\delta$, then $\\omega^{\\beta} = \\omega^{\\delta}$. By the definition of ordinal exponentiation, $\\omega^{\\delta+1} = \\omega^{\\delta} \\cdot \\omega$. Since $\\omega  1$, we have $\\omega^{\\delta}  \\omega^{\\delta} \\cdot \\omega = \\omega^{\\delta+1}$. Thus, $\\omega^{\\beta}  \\omega^{\\gamma}$.\n    - If $\\beta\\delta$, by the induction hypothesis for $\\delta$, we have $\\omega^{\\beta}  \\omega^{\\delta}$. Since ordinal exponentiation is non-decreasing, we have $\\omega^{\\delta} \\le \\omega^{\\delta+1}$. In fact, as just shown, the inequality is strict. Therefore, $\\omega^{\\beta}  \\omega^{\\delta}  \\omega^{\\delta+1} = \\omega^{\\gamma}$.\n- Limit case: Assume $\\gamma$ is a limit ordinal. If $\\beta  \\gamma$, then $\\beta+1  \\gamma$. By definition of exponentiation for limit ordinals, $\\omega^{\\gamma} = \\sup_{\\delta\\gamma}\\omega^{\\delta}$. Since $\\beta+1$ is one of the ordinals $\\delta$ in the supremum, we have $\\omega^{\\beta+1} \\le \\omega^{\\gamma}$. From the successor case, we know $\\omega^{\\beta}  \\omega^{\\beta+1}$. Combining these, we get $\\omega^{\\beta}  \\omega^{\\beta+1} \\le \\omega^{\\gamma}$, so $\\omega^{\\beta}  \\omega^{\\gamma}$.\nThus, $f(\\beta)=\\omega^{\\beta}$ is strictly increasing.\nTo show continuity at limit ordinals, let $\\lambda$ be a limit ordinal. We must show $f(\\lambda) = \\sup_{\\beta\\lambda}f(\\beta)$. This is a direct consequence of the definition of ordinal exponentiation: $f(\\lambda) = \\omega^{\\lambda} = \\sup_{\\beta\\lambda}\\omega^{\\beta} = \\sup_{\\beta\\lambda}f(\\beta)$.\nTherefore, $f(\\beta)=\\omega^{\\beta}$ is a normal function.\n\nSecond, we define an $\\omega$-sequence $(\\alpha_n)_{n\\omega}$ by setting $\\alpha_0=1$ and $\\alpha_{n+1}=f(\\alpha_n)=\\omega^{\\alpha_n}$, and we prove it is strictly increasing. The existence of this sequence is guaranteed by the principle of transfinite recursion on $\\omega$ (standard recursion). We prove $\\alpha_n  \\alpha_{n+1}$ for all $n\\omega$ by induction on $n$.\n- Base case ($n=0$): $\\alpha_0 = 1$ and $\\alpha_1 = \\omega^{\\alpha_0} = \\omega^1 = \\omega$. Since $1$ is the first ordinal and $\\omega$ is the first infinite ordinal, we have $1  \\omega$, so $\\alpha_0  \\alpha_1$.\n- Inductive step: Assume $\\alpha_k  \\alpha_{k+1}$ for some $k\\omega$. We must show that $\\alpha_{k+1}  \\alpha_{k+2}$. Since $f(\\beta)=\\omega^{\\beta}$ is a strictly increasing function, the assumption $\\alpha_k  \\alpha_{k+1}$ implies $f(\\alpha_k)  f(\\alpha_{k+1})$. By the definition of the sequence, $f(\\alpha_k)=\\alpha_{k+1}$ and $f(\\alpha_{k+1})=\\alpha_{k+2}$. Thus, we have $\\alpha_{k+1}  \\alpha_{k+2}$.\nBy the principle of induction, the sequence $(\\alpha_n)_{n\\omega}$ is strictly increasing.\n\nThird, we let $\\lambda=\\sup_{n\\omega}\\alpha_n$ and prove that $f(\\lambda)=\\lambda$, then deduce that $\\lambda=\\epsilon_0$.\nThe ordinal $\\lambda$ is the supremum of a strictly increasing sequence indexed by $\\omega$. This implies that $\\lambda$ is a limit ordinal. Since $f$ is a normal function, it is continuous at limit ordinals. Therefore, $f(\\lambda) = \\sup_{\\beta\\lambda}f(\\beta)$.\nBecause the sequence $(\\alpha_n)_{n\\omega}$ is cofinal in $\\lambda$, for any $\\beta  \\lambda$, there exists some $n\\omega$ such that $\\beta  \\alpha_n$. Since $f$ is increasing, this implies that the set $\\{f(\\alpha_n) \\mid n\\omega\\}$ is cofinal in the set $\\{f(\\beta) \\mid \\beta\\lambda\\}$. Hence, $\\sup_{\\beta\\lambda}f(\\beta) = \\sup_{n\\omega}f(\\alpha_n)$.\nBy definition of the sequence, $f(\\alpha_n)=\\alpha_{n+1}$. So, we have:\n$$f(\\lambda) = \\sup_{n\\omega} f(\\alpha_n) = \\sup_{n\\omega} \\alpha_{n+1}$$\nThe supremum of the sequence $(\\alpha_{n+1})_{n\\omega}$ is the same as the supremum of $(\\alpha_n)_{n\\omega}$. Let $\\lambda' = \\sup_{n\\omega}\\alpha_{n+1}$. The set $\\{\\alpha_n \\mid n0\\}$ is a subset of $\\{\\alpha_n \\mid n \\ge 0\\}$, so $\\lambda' \\le \\lambda$. Conversely, for any $n\\omega$, $\\alpha_n  \\alpha_{n+1} \\le \\lambda'$, so $\\lambda = \\sup_{n\\omega}\\alpha_n \\le \\lambda'$. Thus $\\lambda' = \\lambda$.\nWe conclude that $f(\\lambda) = \\lambda$, which means $\\lambda$ is a fixed point of $f$.\nNow we show that $\\lambda=\\epsilon_0$. The ordinal $\\epsilon_0$ is defined as the *least nonzero* fixed point of $f$. We have shown $\\lambda$ is a fixed point. Since $\\alpha_0=1$ and $\\alpha_1=\\omega$, $\\lambda = \\sup\\{\\alpha_n\\} \\ge \\alpha_1 = \\omega  0$, so $\\lambda$ is nonzero. It remains to show that $\\lambda$ is the *least* such fixed point.\nLet $\\gamma$ be any nonzero fixed point of $f$, so $\\omega^{\\gamma}=\\gamma$. We show by induction that $\\alpha_n  \\gamma$ for all $n\\omega$.\n- Base case ($n=0$): $\\alpha_0 = 1$. Since $\\gamma$ is a nonzero fixed point, $\\gamma = \\omega^\\gamma \\ge \\omega^1 = \\omega  1$. Thus $\\alpha_0  \\gamma$.\n- Inductive step: Assume $\\alpha_k  \\gamma$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $f(\\alpha_k)  f(\\gamma)$. This means $\\omega^{\\alpha_k}  \\omega^{\\gamma}$. By definition, this is $\\alpha_{k+1}  \\gamma$.\nBy induction, $\\alpha_n  \\gamma$ for all $n\\omega$. This means $\\gamma$ is an upper bound for the set $\\{\\alpha_n\\}_{n\\omega}$. The least upper bound of this set is $\\lambda$. Therefore, $\\lambda \\le \\gamma$.\nSince $\\lambda$ is a fixed point and it is less than or equal to any other fixed point $\\gamma$, $\\lambda$ is the least fixed point. As it is also nonzero, we conclude that $\\lambda = \\epsilon_0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the cofinality of $\\epsilon_0$. The cofinality of a limit ordinal $\\alpha$, denoted $\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha)$, is the least cardinal $\\kappa$ such that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals $(\\beta_\\gamma)_{\\gamma\\kappa}$ with $\\sup_{\\gamma\\kappa}\\beta_\\gamma = \\alpha$.\nFrom our construction, we have the sequence $(\\alpha_n)_{n\\omega}$ which is strictly increasing and for which $\\sup_{n\\omega}\\alpha_n = \\epsilon_0$. The index set for this sequence is $\\omega$, which is a cardinal. This demonstrates that there is a cofinal sequence in $\\epsilon_0$ of order type $\\omega$. By the definition of cofinality, this implies $\\operatorname{cf}(\\epsilon_0) \\le \\omega$.\nAn ordinal's cofinality must be a regular cardinal. We know $\\epsilon_0 = \\lambda = \\sup_{n\\omega}\\alpha_n$ is a limit ordinal (as it's the supremum of a strictly increasing sequence with no maximum element). The cofinality of any limit ordinal cannot be a finite number, because a finite increasing sequence has a maximum element, which would imply $\\epsilon_0$ is a successor ordinal, a contradiction. Thus, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\epsilon_0)$ must be an infinite cardinal.\nThe smallest infinite cardinal is $\\omega$ (or $\\aleph_0$).

Since $\\alpha$ is a set of ordinals, the smallest ordinal, $0$, must be an element of $\\alpha$. Let's test the set $C = \\{0\\}$. The cardinality of this set is $|C| = 1$. To check if $C$ is cofinal in $(\\alpha, \\geq)$, we must verify if for every $p \\in \\alpha$, there exists a $c \\in C$ such that $c \\leq p$. With $C = \\{0\\}$, this condition becomes: for every $p \\in \\alpha$, is it true that $0 \\leq p$? Yes, by the definition of ordinals, $0$ is the smallest ordinal, so $0 \\leq p$ for any ordinal $p$. This holds for all $p \\in \\alpha$.

A subset $D \\subseteq \\lambda$ is cofinal if for every $p \\in \\lambda$, there exists a $d \\in D$ such that $p \\leq d$. Since a limit ordinal $\\lambda$ has no maximum element, no finite set can be cofinal. Any cofinal subset of a limit ordinal $\\lambda$ must be infinite. Consequently, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\lambda) \\geq \\aleph_0$.

Next, let's find $\\operatorname{cf}((\\alpha+1, \\geq))$. An ordinal $\\alpha+1$ is nonzero. From the result in option A, for any nonzero ordinal $\\beta$, $\\operatorname{cf}((\\beta, \\geq)) = 1$. Applying this to $\\beta = \\alpha+1$, we get $\\operatorname{cf}((\\alpha+1, \\geq)) = 1$. Therefore, for every successor ordinal $\\alpha+1$, both cofinalities are equal to 1.

The set $C = \\{0\\}$ is a finite cofinal subset. The statement claims that *any* cofinal subset must be infinite, which is false. Thus, the statement is false.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2970159"}]}
