A function $F$ on regular cardinals is said to satisfy Easton’s constraints if it satisfies these two conditions:\n1.

We will compute the two terms in the sum for $V(F)$ separately.\n\nFirst, we compute the number of monotonicity violations, which is the cardinality of the set $S_1 = \\{(\\kappa, \\lambda) \\in D \\times D : \\kappa < \\lambda \\text{ and } F(\\kappa) \\nleq F(\\lambda)\\}$. The pairs $(\\kappa, \\lambda)$ in $D \\times D$ such that $\\kappa < \\lambda$ are $(\\aleph_0, \\aleph_1)$, $(\\aleph_0, \\aleph_2)$, and $(\\aleph_1, \\aleph_2)$. We check the condition $F(\\kappa) \\leq F(\\lambda)$ for each pair.\n1.  For the pair $(\\kappa, \\lambda) = (\\aleph_0, \\aleph_1)$: We have $F(\\aleph_0) = \\aleph_1$ and $F(\\aleph_1) = \\aleph_4$. The condition to check is $\\aleph_1 \\leq \\aleph_4$. Since the aleph sequence is strictly increasing with its index, and $1 < 4$, the inequality $\\aleph_1 \\leq \\aleph_4$ is true. Thus, this pair does not contribute to the violation count.\n2.  For the pair $(\\kappa, \\lambda) = (\\aleph_0, \\aleph_2)$: We have $F(\\aleph_0) = \\aleph_1$ and $F(\\aleph_2) = \\aleph_5$. The condition to check is $\\aleph_1 \\leq \\aleph_5$.

For the pair $(\\kappa, \\lambda) = (\\aleph_1, \\aleph_2)$: We have $F(\\aleph_1) = \\aleph_4$ and $F(\\aleph_2) = \\aleph_5$. The condition to check is $\\aleph_4 \\leq \\aleph_5$. Since $4 < 5$, the inequality $\\aleph_4 \\leq \\aleph_5$ is true. This pair also does not represent a violation.\n\nSince none of the pairs violate the monotonicity condition, the set $S_1$ is empty. Therefore, its cardinality is $|S_1| = 0$.\n\nSecond, we compute the number of cofinality-bound violations, which is the cardinality of the set $S_2 = \\{\\kappa \\in D : \\operatorname{cf}(F(\\kappa)) \\leq \\kappa\\}$. We must check this condition for each $\\kappa$ in the domain $D = \\{\\aleph_0, \\aleph_1, \\aleph_2\\}$.

For $\\kappa = \\aleph_0$: We have $F(\\aleph_0) = \\aleph_1$. The problem states that $\\aleph_1$ is a regular cardinal. Therefore, $\\operatorname{cf}(F(\\aleph_0)) = \\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_1) = \\aleph_1$. The condition for violation is $\\aleph_1 \\leq \\aleph_0$. This is false. Thus, $\\kappa = \\aleph_0$ does not belong to $S_2$.\n2.  For $\\kappa = \\aleph_1$: We have $F(\\aleph_1) = \\aleph_4$. The problem states that $\\aleph_4$ is a regular cardinal. Therefore, $\\operatorname{cf}(F(\\aleph_1)) = \\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_4) = \\aleph_4$. The condition for violation is $\\aleph_4 \\leq \\aleph_1$. This is false, because $4 > 1$. Thus, $\\kappa = \\aleph_1$ does not belong to $S_2$.\n3.  For $\\kappa = \\aleph_2$: We have $F(\\aleph_2) = \\aleph_5$. The problem states that $\\aleph_5$ is a regular cardinal. Therefore, $\\operatorname{cf}(F(\\aleph_2)) = \\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_5) = \\aleph_5$. The condition for violation is $\\aleph_5 \\leq \\aleph_2$. This is false, because $5 > 2$. Thus, $\\kappa = \\aleph_2$ does not belong to $S_2$.\n\nSince no element in the domain $D$ satisfies the violation condition, the set $S_2$ is empty. Therefore, its cardinality is $|S_2| = 0$.\n\nFinally, we compute the total violation count $V(F)$ by summing the cardinalities of the two violation sets:\n$$\nV(F) = |S_1| + |S_2| = 0 + 0 = 0.\n$$\nThe function $F$ on the domain $D$ satisfies both of Easton's constraints, so there are no violations.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2985346"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the static constraints on the continuum function, we now turn to its dynamic nature by exploring the independence of the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH).

The definitions and theorems cited are standard and correctly stated. The question asks to identify correct examples of forcing extensions of $L$ where the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis ($\\mathsf{GCH}$) fails, along with a correct explanation for why this does not contradict Gödel's theorem that $L$ itself satisfies $\\mathsf{GCH}$.\n\nThe core principle required to resolve this problem is the relationship between a model of set theory and its inner models, particularly its constructible universe. Gödel's theorem states that for any transitive model $V$ of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ($\\mathsf{ZF}$), its constructible universe, denoted $L^V$, is an inner model of $V$ that satisfies Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice ($\\mathsf{ZFC}$) and the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis ($\\mathsf{GCH}$).\n\nA crucial property of the constructible universe is its absoluteness. If $V$ is a transitive model of $\\mathsf{ZF}$ and $V[G]$ is a generic extension obtained by forcing, then the constructible universe as defined within the new model $V[G]$ is identical to the constructible universe of the original model $V$. That is, $(L)^{V[G]} = L^V$.\n\nIn the problem, we start with the model $V=L$. Therefore, for any generic extension $L[G]$, it holds that $(L)^{L[G]} = L^L = L$. When we consider Gödel's theorem from the perspective of the new universe $L[G]$, it asserts that $(L)^{L[G]}$ satisfies $\\mathsf{ZFC} + \\mathsf{GCH}$. Since $(L)^{L[G]} = L$, this simply means that $L$, now an inner model of $L[G]$, satisfies $\\mathsf{ZFC} + \\mathsf{GCH}$.\n\nA failure of $\\mathsf{GCH}$ in the extension $L[G]$ means that there exists some infinite cardinal $\\kappa$ (in $L[G]$) such that $(2^\\kappa)^{L[G]} \\ne (\\kappa^+)^{L[G]}$. This is possible because the power set operation is not absolute; forcing can add new subsets to a set from the ground model, so that $\\mathcal{P}(x)^{L[G]}$ can be strictly larger than $\\mathcal{P}(x)^L$.\n\nA correct option must therefore (1) describe a valid forcing construction over $L$ that results in $L[G] \\models \\neg\\mathsf{GCH}$, and (2) explain that this does not contradict Gödel's theorem because the theorem applies to the inner model $L^{L[G]} (=L)$, not to the ambient universe $L[G]$ where $\\mathsf{GCH}$ may fail.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**Option A:**\nThe proposal is to start with $V=L$ and force with $\\mathbb{P} = \\operatorname{Add}(\\omega, \\aleph_2)$, the standard poset for adding $(\\aleph_2)^L$ Cohen reals. In the ground model $L$, the poset $\\mathbb{P}$ has the countable chain condition (c.c.c.). As a consequence, forcing with $\\mathbb{P}$ preserves all cardinals and cofinalities, so $(\\aleph_\\alpha)^L = (\\aleph_\\alpha)^{L[G]}$ for all ordinals $\\alpha$. This forcing adds $(\\aleph_2)^L$ distinct new subsets of $\\omega$ to the model. Thus, in the extension $L[G]$, the cardinality of the power set of $\\omega$, denoted $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{L[G]}$, must be at least $(\\aleph_2)^L$. A standard counting argument for c.c.c. forcings shows that $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{L[G]} = (\\aleph_2)^L$. Since cardinals are preserved, this means $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_2$ in $L[G]$. This violates the Continuum Hypothesis ($\\mathsf{CH}$), which is the instance of $\\mathsf{GCH}$ for $\\kappa=\\aleph_0$. So, the example of a forcing that breaks $\\mathsf{GCH}$ is correct.\n\nThe explanation provided is: \"in $L[G]$ the inner model $L^{L[G]}$ still satisfies $\\mathsf{ZFC}+\\mathsf{GCH}$; forcing alters the ambient universe’s power sets but does not invalidate that the constructible inner model of any universe satisfies $\\mathsf{GCH}$.\" This is precisely the correct reasoning. The failure of $\\mathsf{GCH}$ is in the universe $L[G]$, while Gödel's theorem applies to the inner model $L^{L[G]} = L$. The statement is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:**\nThe proposal is to start with $V=L$ and force with $\\operatorname{Add}(\\omega, 1)$, which adds a single Cohen real. This forcing is c.c.c., so cardinals are preserved. In the ground model $L$, we have $\\mathsf{GCH}$, so $(2^{\\aleph_0})^L = (\\aleph_1)^L$. It is a standard result that adding one Cohen real to a model of $\\mathsf{GCH}$ results in a model where $\\mathsf{CH}$ still holds. Specifically, $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{L[G]} = (\\aleph_1)^L = \\aleph_1^{L[G]}$. The option incorrectly claims that in the extension $L[G]$, $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_2$. Thus, the proposed example does not achieve its stated goal of violating $\\mathsf{GCH}$.\n\nThe explanation provided is: \"forcing eliminates $\\mathsf{GCH}$ from $L$ itself.\" This is conceptually flawed. Forcing creates a new, larger universe $L[G]$, of which $L$ is an inner model. The properties of $L$ itself are not changed; $L$ remains a model of $\\mathsf{GCH}$. The statement that $\\mathsf{GCH}$ is \"eliminated\" from $L$ is incorrect.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\nThe proposal is to start with $V=L$ and use a $\\sigma$-closed poset. The option contains contradictory claims. It states that \"the continuum function $\\kappa\\mapsto 2^{\\kappa}$ is unchanged\". If the continuum function were unchanged from the ground model $L$ (where $\\mathsf{GCH}$ holds), then $\\mathsf{GCH}$ would necessarily hold in the extension $L[G]$ as well. However, the option then asserts that \"GCH fails for trivial reasons\". These two statements are mutually exclusive.\n\nFurthermore, the explanation given is \"$\\sigma$-closed forcing never affects any instance of GCH\". This is factually incorrect. For example, starting in $L$ and forcing with $\\mathbb{P} = \\operatorname{Add}(\\omega_1, (\\aleph_3)^L)$ uses a poset that is $\\omega_1$-closed (and therefore $\\sigma$-closed). This forcing preserves cardinals up to $\\aleph_1$ but makes $(2^{\\aleph_1})^{L[G]} = (\\aleph_3)^L = \\aleph_3^{L[G]}$, which violates $\\mathsf{GCH}$ at the cardinal $\\aleph_1$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\nThe proposal is to start with $V=L$ and apply Easton forcing to set $2^{\\aleph_\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+2}$ for each regular cardinal $\\aleph_\\alpha$. Easton's theorem provides a method to construct a class forcing extension that sets the continuum function $F(\\kappa) = 2^\\kappa$ for all regular cardinals $\\kappa$, provided $F$ satisfies two conditions: monotonicity ($\\kappa < \\lambda \\implies F(\\kappa) \\le F(\\lambda)$) and a constraint from König's theorem ($cf(F(\\kappa)) > \\kappa$). The proposed function $F(\\aleph_\\alpha) = \\aleph_{\\alpha+2}$ satisfies these conditions:\n1. Monotonicity: if $\\aleph_\\alpha < \\aleph_\\beta$, then $\\aleph_{\\alpha+2} < \\aleph_{\\beta+2}$, which is true.\n2. König's theorem: $cf(\\aleph_{\\alpha+2}) > \\aleph_\\alpha$. Since $\\aleph_{\\alpha+2}$ is a regular cardinal, its cofinality is itself, so we need $\\aleph_{\\alpha+2} > \\aleph_\\alpha$, which is true.\nThus, by Easton's theorem, there is a cardinal- and cofinality-preserving extension $L[G]$ in which $2^{\\aleph_\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+2}$ for every regular cardinal $\\aleph_\\alpha$. This violates $\\mathsf{GCH}$ at every regular cardinal. The example is correct.\n\nThe explanation provided is: \"$L^{L[G]}$ exists as an inner model in $L[G]$ that satisfies $\\mathsf{ZFC}+\\mathsf{GCH}$, while $L[G]$ itself is free to violate $\\mathsf{GCH}$ at many cardinals.\" As with option A, this is the correct explanation based on the absoluteness of $L$, where $L^{L[G]}=L$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2973770"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply violating GCH, set theorists can construct models with precise control over the continuum function's behavior across many cardinals.

No rounding is required, and no physical units are involved.", "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of a specific model of set theory obtained via Easton's forcing. The analysis involves three parts: verifying the validity of the Easton function $F$, computing certain values of the continuum function in the new model, and confirming the preservation of regularity/singularity for specific cardinals.\n\nFirst, we address the verification of the Easton function $F$. The ground model is ZFC+GCH. Easton's theorem states that for a function $F$ defined on the class of regular cardinals, there exists a forcing extension preserving cardinals and cofinalities in which $2^{\\kappa} = F(\\kappa)$ for all regular cardinals $\\kappa$, provided $F$ meets two conditions:\n$1$. Monotonicity: For any regular cardinals $\\kappa < \\lambda$, $F(\\kappa) \\le F(\\lambda)$.\n$2$. Cofinality constraint (from König's theorem): For any regular cardinal $\\kappa$, its cofinality $\\operatorname{cf}(F(\\kappa))$ must be strictly greater than $\\kappa$, i.e., $\\operatorname{cf}(F(\\kappa)) > \\kappa$.\n\nThe given Easton function is $F(\\aleph_{\\alpha}) = \\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha+1}$ for every regular cardinal $\\aleph_{\\alpha}$. We verify the two conditions for this function.\n\nFor monotonicity, let $\\aleph_{\\alpha}$ and $\\aleph_{\\beta}$ be two regular cardinals such that $\\aleph_{\\alpha} < \\aleph_{\\beta}$. This implies that the ordinal indices satisfy $\\alpha < \\beta$. Ordinal arithmetic ensures that if $\\alpha < \\beta$, then $\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha+1 < \\omega\\cdot 2+\\beta+1$. The function mapping an ordinal $\\gamma$ to the cardinal $\\aleph_{\\gamma}$ is strictly increasing. Therefore, $\\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha+1} < \\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2+\\beta+1}$. This means $F(\\aleph_{\\alpha}) < F(\\aleph_{\\beta})$. The strict inequality implies $F(\\aleph_{\\alpha}) \\le F(\\aleph_{\\beta})$, so the monotonicity condition is satisfied.\n\nFor the cofinality constraint, let $\\kappa = \\aleph_{\\alpha}$ be a regular cardinal. The value of the function is $F(\\kappa) = \\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha+1}$. The index of this aleph, $\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha+1 = (\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha)+1$, is a successor ordinal. Any cardinal of the form $\\aleph_{\\gamma+1}$ is a successor cardinal and is therefore regular. Consequently, $F(\\kappa)$ is a regular cardinal. The cofinality of any regular cardinal is the cardinal itself. Thus, $\\operatorname{cf}(F(\\kappa)) = \\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha+1}) = \\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha+1}$. We must check if this is strictly greater than $\\kappa = \\aleph_{\\alpha}$. This inequality $\\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha+1} > \\aleph_{\\alpha}$ holds if and only if the ordinal index $\\omega\\cdot 2+\\alpha+1 > \\alpha$. This is true for any ordinal $\\alpha$, since $\\alpha < \\alpha+1$ and $\\alpha+1 \\le \\omega \\cdot 2 + \\alpha + 1$ (as $\\omega \\cdot 2 > 0$). Therefore, the cofinality constraint is satisfied.\nSince both conditions hold, the function $F$ is a valid Easton function and can be realized in a forcing extension as described.\n\nNext, we compute the values of $2^{\\omega_1}$ and $2^{\\omega_2}$ in the resulting Easton extension. In set theory, $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are alternative notations for the cardinals $\\aleph_1$ and $\\aleph_2$, respectively. Since the extension is an Easton model for $F$, the continuum function is given by $2^{\\kappa} = F(\\kappa)$ for all regular cardinals $\\kappa$.\nThe cardinals $\\aleph_1$ (with index $\\alpha=1$) and $\\aleph_2$ (with index $\\alpha=2$) are successor cardinals, and thus are regular. We can therefore apply the formula for $F$.\n\nFor $2^{\\aleph_1}$:\nWe substitute $\\alpha=1$ into the definition of $F$.\n$$2^{\\aleph_1} = F(\\aleph_1) = \\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2 + 1 + 1} = \\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2 + 2}$$\n\nFor $2^{\\aleph_2}$:\nWe substitute $\\alpha=2$ into the definition of $F$.\n$$2^{\\aleph_2} = F(\\aleph_2) = \\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2 + 2 + 1} = \\aleph_{\\omega\\cdot 2 + 3}$$\n\nFinally, we analyze the regularity and singularity of the specified cardinals. The problem statement asserts that the Easton support product forcing preserves cardinals and cofinalities. This is a fundamental property of this construction.\n\nConsider the cardinals $\\aleph_n$ for $n < \\omega$. In the ground model, $\\aleph_0$ is regular. For any natural number $n>0$, $\\aleph_n$ is a successor cardinal ($\\aleph_n = (\\aleph_{n-1})^+$), which implies it is regular. So, in the ground model, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_n) = \\aleph_n$ for all $n < \\omega$. Since cardinals and cofinalities are preserved in the extension, the same equality $\\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_n) = \\aleph_n$ holds in the new model. Therefore, the cardinals $\\aleph_n$ for $n < \\omega$ remain regular.\n\nConsider the cardinal $\\aleph_{\\omega}$. This is the supremum of the sequence of cardinals $\\{\\aleph_n\\}_{n < \\omega}$. By definition, its cofinality in the ground model is $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega) = \\omega = \\aleph_0$. Since $\\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_{\\omega}) = \\aleph_0 < \\aleph_{\\omega}$, $\\aleph_{\\omega}$ is a singular cardinal in the ground model. As cardinals and cofinalities are preserved, $\\aleph_{\\omega}$ remains a cardinal in the extension, and its cofinality remains $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, $\\aleph_{\\omega}$ is also a singular cardinal in the Easton extension.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the regularity of $\\aleph_n$ for $n<\\omega$ and the singularity of $\\aleph_{\\omega}$ are preserved, a direct consequence of the properties of Easton forcing stated in the problem.\n\nThe final answer is the computed pair of cardinals $(2^{\\omega_1}, 2^{\\omega_2})$.
