The ordinal $\\omega^{\\omega}$ is defined by transfinite recursion. Since the exponent $\\omega$ is a limit ordinal, the definition is $\\omega^{\\omega} = \\sup\\{\\omega^{\\beta} : \\beta < \\omega\\}$. The ordinals $\\beta$ less than $\\omega$ are the finite ordinals, which can be denoted by $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$. Thus, we can write $\\omega^{\\omega} = \\sup\\{\\omega^{n} : n < \\omega\\}$.\n\nThis definition directly suggests a candidate for a cofinal sequence. Let us define a sequence $\\langle \\alpha_n \\rangle_{n < \\omega}$ by setting $\\alpha_n = \\omega^n$ for each finite ordinal $n < \\omega$. We must verify that this sequence is strictly increasing and cofinal in $\\omega^{\\omega}$, and that its order type is $\\omega$.\n\n1.  **Order Type**: The sequence is indexed by the finite ordinals $n \\in \\omega$. The order type of the indexing set $\\omega = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\}$ is by definition $\\omega$. Thus, the sequence $\\langle \\alpha_n \\rangle_{n < \\omega}$ has order type $\\omega$.\n\n2.  **Strictly Increasing**: We need to show that for any $n < \\omega$, we have $\\alpha_n < \\alpha_{n+1}$. This is equivalent to showing $\\omega^n < \\omega^{n+1}$. By the recursive definition of ordinal exponentiation for a successor ordinal, $\\omega^{n+1} = \\omega^n \\cdot \\omega$. Since $\\omega \\ge 2$, we have $\\omega^n < \\omega^n \\cdot 2 \\le \\omega^n \\cdot \\omega = \\omega^{n+1}$. A more direct argument is that $\\omega^{n+1} = \\omega^n \\cdot \\omega = \\omega^n + \\omega^n + \\dots$ ($\\omega$ times). Since $\\omega^n > 0$, we have $\\omega^n < \\omega^n + \\omega^n$, and $\\omega^n + \\omega^n \\le \\omega^{n+1}$. Therefore, $\\omega^n < \\omega^{n+1}$. The sequence $\\langle \\omega^n \\rangle_{n < \\omega}$ is strictly increasing.\n\n3.  **Cofinality**: A sequence $\\langle \\alpha_n \\rangle_{n < \\omega}$ is cofinal in an ordinal $\\gamma$ if $\\sup\\{\\alpha_n : n < \\omega\\} = \\gamma$. For our sequence, we need to check if $\\sup\\{\\omega^n : n < \\omega\\} = \\omega^{\\omega}$. As established at the beginning, this is precisely the definition of $\\omega^{\\omega}$ given in the problem statement, since $\\omega$ is a limit ordinal. Therefore, the sequence $\\langle \\omega^n \\rangle_{n < \\omega}$ is cofinal in $\\omega^{\\omega}$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed an explicit sequence, $\\langle \\omega^n \\rangle_{n < \\omega}$, which is strictly increasing, has order type $\\omega$, and is cofinal in $\\omega^{\\omega}$.\n\nNext, we compute the cofinality $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega^{\\omega})$. The cofinality of a limit ordinal $\\gamma$, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)$, is defined as the *least* order type of a strictly increasing sequence that is cofinal in $\\gamma$.\n\nFrom our construction, we have found a cofinal sequence in $\\omega^{\\omega}$ of order type $\\omega$. By the definition of cofinality as the least such order type, this immediately implies that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega^{\\omega}) \\le \\omega$.\n\nTo determine the exact value, we must establish a lower bound. A fundamental property of cofinality is that for any limit ordinal $\\gamma$, its cofinality $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)$ must also be a limit ordinal. To see this, let $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma) = \\kappa$ and assume for contradiction that $\\kappa$ is a successor ordinal, i.e., $\\kappa = \\delta + 1$ for some ordinal $\\delta$. By definition of cofinality, there exists a strictly increasing cofinal map $f: \\kappa \\to \\gamma$. The domain of this map is $\\{\\alpha : \\alpha \\le \\delta\\}$. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, its supremum is its maximum element, $f(\\delta)$. The cofinality property requires $\\sup(\\operatorname{ran}(f)) = \\gamma$, so we must have $f(\\delta) = \\gamma$. However, a cofinal sequence in $\\gamma$ must consist of elements strictly less than $\\gamma$, so $f(\\alpha) < \\gamma$ for all $\\alpha < \\kappa$. This implies $f(\\delta) < \\gamma$, a contradiction. Therefore, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)$ cannot be a successor ordinal. Since $\\operatorname{cf}(\\gamma)$ must be an ordinal, it must be a limit ordinal.\n\nThe ordinal $\\omega^{\\omega}$ is a limit ordinal, as it is the supremum of the infinite set $\\{\\omega^n : n < \\omega\\}$ which has no largest element. Therefore, its cofinality, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega^{\\omega})$, must be a limit ordinal. The smallest limit ordinal is $\\omega$. Consequently, we must have $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega^{\\omega}) \\ge \\omega$.\n\nCombining the two inequalities we have derived:\n1.  $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega^{\\omega}) \\le \\omega$ (from the explicit construction of a cofinal sequence of order type $\\omega$)\n2.  $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega^{\\omega}) \\ge \\omega$ (because the cofinality of a limit ordinal must be a limit ordinal, and $\\omega$ is the smallest limit ordinal)\n\nFrom these two conditions, we can uniquely conclude that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\omega^{\\omega}) = \\omega$.

All provided definitions and facts are standard. The problem is a formal exercise in cardinal arithmetic, specifically concerning the concepts of cofinality and regular and singular cardinals. It is complete and contains no contradictions. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to construct a strictly increasing sequence of regular cardinals $\\langle \\kappa_{n} : n < \\omega \\rangle$, and then to compute the cofinality of its supremum, $\\kappa = \\sup_{n < \\omega} \\kappa_{n}$.\n\nFirst, we construct the sequence. The problem states as a fact that every successor cardinal is regular. A successor cardinal is an infinite cardinal of the form $\\aleph_{\\alpha+1}$ for some ordinal $\\alpha$. The sequence of alephs, $\\langle \\aleph_{\\alpha} \\rangle_{\\alpha \\in \\text{Ord}}$, is a strictly increasing enumeration of all infinite cardinals. To form our sequence $\\langle \\kappa_n : n < \\omega \\rangle$, we require its elements to be regular. A simple and explicit construction is to define $\\kappa_n$ for each natural number $n < \\omega$ as:\n$$ \\kappa_n = \\aleph_n $$\nLet us verify that this sequence meets the stated requirements.\n1.  The sequence $\\langle \\aleph_{n} : n < \\omega \\rangle$ is strictly increasing, as for any $n < m < \\omega$, we have $\\aleph_n < \\aleph_m$.\n2.  Each cardinal $\\kappa_n$ in the sequence is regular. For $n=0$, $\\kappa_0 = \\aleph_0$. The cofinality of $\\aleph_0$ is $\\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_0) = \\aleph_0$, so it is a regular cardinal. For any $n > 0$, the index $n$ is a successor ordinal (namely, $n = (n-1)+1$). Thus, for $n>0$, $\\kappa_n = \\aleph_n$ is a successor cardinal. By the provided fact, every successor cardinal is regular. Therefore, every cardinal in the sequence $\\langle \\aleph_n : n < \\omega \\rangle$ is regular.\n\nHaving constructed a valid sequence, we now define the limit cardinal $\\kappa$ as its supremum:\n$$ \\kappa = \\sup_{n < \\omega} \\kappa_n = \\sup_{n < \\omega} \\aleph_n $$\nThe problem states that the aleph sequence is continuous at limit ordinals, which means that for any limit ordinal $\\lambda$, it holds that $\\aleph_{\\lambda} = \\sup_{\\beta < \\lambda} \\aleph_{\\beta}$. The first infinite ordinal, $\\omega$, is a limit ordinal. Applying this property for $\\lambda = \\omega$, we get:\n$$ \\aleph_{\\omega} = \\sup_{\\beta < \\omega} \\aleph_{\\beta} $$\nThe ordinals $\\beta$ such that $\\beta < \\omega$ are precisely the natural numbers $n$. Thus, the supremum can be written as:\n$$ \\aleph_{\\omega} = \\sup_{n < \\omega} \\aleph_n $$\nComparing this with our definition of $\\kappa$, we identify the limit cardinal as $\\kappa = \\aleph_{\\omega}$.\n\nFinally, we must compute the cofinality of $\\kappa$, which is $\\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_{\\omega})$. The cofinality of an ordinal $\\alpha$, denoted $\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha)$, is defined as the least order type of a subset of $\\alpha$ that is cofinal (unbounded) in $\\alpha$. A subset $S \\subseteq \\alpha$ is cofinal in $\\alpha$ if for every $\\gamma < \\alpha$, there exists some $\\delta \\in S$ such that $\\gamma < \\delta$.\n\nLet us consider the set of cardinals from our constructed sequence, $S = \\{ \\kappa_n : n < \\omega \\} = \\{ \\aleph_n : n < \\omega \\}$. This set $S$ is a subset of $\\kappa = \\aleph_{\\omega}$. Let us determine if $S$ is cofinal in $\\aleph_{\\omega}$. By the definition of a supremum, for any ordinal $\\gamma < \\sup(S) = \\aleph_\\omega$, there must exist an element $\\delta \\in S$ such that $\\gamma < \\delta$. In our case, for any $\\gamma < \\aleph_{\\omega}$, there is some $m < \\omega$ such that $\\gamma < \\aleph_m$. This shows that the set $S$ is indeed cofinal in $\\aleph_{\\omega}$.\n\nThe order type of the set $S$, with the elements ordered by magnitude, is the same as the order type of its index set, which is $\\omega$. Since we have found a cofinal subset of $\\aleph_{\\omega}$ with order type $\\omega$, the definition of cofinality as the *least* such order type implies:\n$$ \\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_{\\omega}) \\le \\omega $$\nTo establish a lower bound, we note that $\\kappa = \\aleph_{\\omega}$ is an infinite cardinal, and therefore its cofinality must be an infinite cardinal/ordinal. If $\\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_{\\omega}) = k$ for some finite ordinal $k < \\omega$, then $\\aleph_{\\omega}$ would be the supremum of a finite set of ordinals $\\{\\gamma_0, \\dots, \\gamma_{k-1}\\}$. The supremum of a finite set of ordinals is its maximum element, which would mean $\\aleph_{\\omega} = \\max\\{\\gamma_i\\} = \\gamma_j$ for some $j<k$. However, any cofinal subset of $\\aleph_{\\omega}$ must consist of ordinals strictly less than $\\aleph_{\\omega}$, so $\\gamma_j < \\aleph_{\\omega}$, leading to a contradiction. Thus, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_{\\omega})$ must be an infinite ordinal. The smallest infinite ordinal is $\\omega$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$ \\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_{\\omega}) \\ge \\omega $$\nCombining the two inequalities, we conclude:\n$$ \\operatorname{cf}(\\aleph_{\\omega}) = \\omega $$\nThis result shows that $\\kappa = \\aleph_{\\omega}$ is a singular cardinal, since $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) = \\omega < \\aleph_{\\omega} = \\kappa$. It is, in fact, the first example of a singular cardinal of the form $\\aleph_\\lambda$ where $\\lambda$ is a limit ordinal.

The ordinal $\\omega_1$ is the set of all countable ordinals. It is not zero and it is not a successor ordinal (if $\\omega_1 = \\alpha+1$ for some ordinal $\\alpha$, then $\\alpha$ would be the largest countable ordinal, which contradicts the fact that for any countable ordinal, its successor is also a countable ordinal). Therefore, $\\omega_1$ is a limit ordinal.\n\nUsing the given property of continuity for the map $\\delta \\mapsto \\omega_{\\delta}$ at limit ordinals, we can write $\\kappa$ as a supremum:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\omega_{\\omega_1} = \\sup_{\\alpha < \\omega_1} \\omega_{\\alpha}.\n$$\nThis expression means that $\\kappa$ is the least upper bound for the set of cardinals $\\{ \\omega_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha < \\omega_1 \\}$. Let us define the set $S \\coloneqq \\{ \\omega_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha < \\omega_1 \\}$.\n\nBy its definition, $S$ is a subset of $\\kappa$. To show that it is an unbounded (or cofinal) subset of $\\kappa$, we must demonstrate that for any ordinal $\\beta < \\kappa$, there exists an element $\\gamma \\in S$ such that $\\beta < \\gamma$.\n\nLet $\\beta$ be an arbitrary ordinal such that $\\beta < \\kappa$. By the definition of cardinals as initial ordinals, this implies that the cardinality of $\\beta$, denoted $|\\beta|$, is strictly less than the cardinality of $\\kappa$. That is, $|\\beta| < |\\kappa| = \\kappa = \\omega_{\\omega_1}$.\nThe set of cardinals less than $\\omega_{\\omega_1}$ is precisely $\\{ \\omega_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha < \\omega_1 \\}$. Thus, there must exist some ordinal $\\alpha_0 < \\omega_1$ such that $|\\beta| \\le \\omega_{\\alpha_0}$.\nSince $\\omega_{\\alpha_0}$ is an initial ordinal (a cardinal), any ordinal with cardinality less than or equal to $\\omega_{\\alpha_0}$ must be less than or equal to $\\omega_{\\alpha_0}$ itself. This implies $\\beta \\le \\omega_{\\alpha_0}$.\nSince $\\alpha_0 < \\omega_1$, the successor ordinal $\\alpha_0+1$ is also less than $\\omega_1$ (as $\\omega_1$ is a limit ordinal). Let $\\gamma = \\omega_{\\alpha_0+1}$. Since the map $\\alpha \\mapsto \\omega_{\\alpha}$ is strictly increasing, $\\omega_{\\alpha_0} < \\omega_{\\alpha_0+1} = \\gamma$.\nThe element $\\gamma$ is in the set $S$ because its index $\\alpha_0+1$ is less than $\\omega_1$.\nWe have shown that for an arbitrary $\\beta < \\kappa$, there exists $\\gamma \\in S$ (namely $\\omega_{\\alpha_0+1}$) such that $\\beta \\le \\omega_{\\alpha_0} < \\gamma$. This confirms that $S$ is an unbounded subset of $\\kappa$.\n\nThe cofinality $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ is the *least* order type of any such unbounded subset. The existence of $S$ implies that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ is less than or equal to the order type of $S$. The map $\\alpha \\mapsto \\omega_{\\alpha}$ is strictly increasing for $\\alpha < \\omega_1$, so it defines an order isomorphism between the set of indices $\\{\\alpha \\mid \\alpha < \\omega_1\\}$ (which is the ordinal $\\omega_1$) and the set $S$. The order type of the ordinal $\\omega_1$ is $\\omega_1$. Therefore, the order type of $S$ is $\\omega_1$.\n\nFrom this, we conclude that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\le \\omega_1$.\n\n**Step 2: Establishing a lower bound for $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$.**\n\nWe now prove that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\ge \\omega_1$. We proceed by contradiction. Assume that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) < \\omega_1$.\nThe cofinality of any infinite cardinal is always an infinite regular cardinal. Since $\\kappa = \\omega_{\\omega_1}$ is uncountable, its cofinality must be an infinite cardinal. The only infinite cardinal less than $\\omega_1$ is $\\omega_0$ (the first infinite cardinal, the cardinality of the natural numbers). Thus, our assumption simplifies to $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) = \\omega_0$.\n\nIf $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) = \\omega_0$, there exists a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals $\\{\\beta_n\\}_{n < \\omega_0}$ that is cofinal in $\\kappa$. This means that for all $n \\in \\omega_0$, $\\beta_n < \\kappa$, and their supremum is $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\sup_{n < \\omega_0} \\beta_n = \\kappa.\n$$\nSince each $\\beta_n$ is an ordinal strictly less than $\\kappa = \\omega_{\\omega_1}$, its cardinality $|\\beta_n|$ is a cardinal strictly less than $\\kappa$. Thus, for each $n < \\omega_0$, there is an ordinal $\\delta_n < \\omega_1$ such that $|\\beta_n| = \\omega_{\\delta_n}$.\n\nLet us consider the set of indices $\\{\\delta_n \\mid n < \\omega_0\\}$. This is a countable set of ordinals, and each $\\delta_n$ is a countable ordinal (since $\\delta_n < \\omega_1$). The supremum of a countable set of countable ordinals is itself a countable ordinal. Let $\\delta = \\sup_{n < \\omega_0} \\delta_n$. Then $\\delta < \\omega_1$.\n\nFor every $n < \\omega_0$, we have $\\delta_n \\le \\delta$. As the map $\\alpha \\mapsto \\omega_{\\alpha}$ is non-decreasing (in fact, strictly increasing), this implies $|\\beta_n| = \\omega_{\\delta_n} \\le \\omega_{\\delta}$.\n\nThe supremum of a set of ordinals is their union. Thus, $\\kappa = \\bigcup_{n < \\omega_0} \\beta_n$. Taking the cardinality of both sides, we get:\n$$\n\\kappa = |\\kappa| = \\left| \\bigcup_{n < \\omega_0} \\beta_n \\right|.\n$$\nThe cardinality of a union of sets is less than or equal to the sum of their cardinalities:\n$$\n\\kappa \\le \\sum_{n < \\omega_0} |\\beta_n|.\n$$\nUsing the bound we found for each $|\\beta_n|$:\n$$\n\\kappa \\le \\sum_{n < \\omega_0} \\omega_{\\delta}.\n$$\nThe sum on the right is a sum of $\\omega_0$ identical cardinals. This sum is equal to their product:\n$$\n\\sum_{n < \\omega_0} \\omega_{\\delta} = \\omega_0 \\cdot \\omega_{\\delta}.\n$$\nThe product of two infinite cardinals is their maximum. $\\delta$ is a countable ordinal, so $\\omega_{\\delta}$ is either a countable cardinal (like $\\omega_0$ if $\\delta$ is finite) or an uncountable cardinal (if $\\delta$ is infinite, i.e., $\\omega_0 \\le \\delta < \\omega_1$). In either case, since $\\delta \\ge 0$, $\\omega_{\\delta} \\ge \\omega_0$. Thus, $\\omega_0 \\cdot \\omega_{\\delta} = \\max(\\omega_0, \\omega_{\\delta}) = \\omega_{\\delta}$.\n\nCombining these inequalities, we arrive at:\n$$\n\\kappa \\le \\omega_{\\delta}.\n$$\nHowever, we established that $\\delta = \\sup_{n < \\omega_0} \\delta_n < \\omega_1$. Since the map $\\alpha \\mapsto \\omega_{\\alpha}$ is strictly increasing, $\\delta < \\omega_1$ implies that $\\omega_{\\delta} < \\omega_{\\omega_1}$. Recalling that $\\kappa = \\omega_{\\omega_1}$, we have:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\delta} < \\kappa.\n$$\nWe have derived the statement $\\kappa \\le \\omega_{\\delta}$ and we know that $\\omega_{\\delta} < \\kappa$. This is a contradiction ($\\kappa < \\kappa$). The contradiction stems from our initial assumption that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) = \\omega_0$. Therefore, this assumption must be false.\n\nSince $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa)$ is an infinite cardinal and not $\\omega_0$, it must be that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\ge \\omega_1$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFrom Step 1, we have $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\le \\omega_1$. From Step 2, we have $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) \\ge \\omega_1$. The only possibility is that $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) = \\omega_1$.\n\nFinally, we must determine if $\\kappa$ is a singular cardinal. An infinite cardinal $\\nu$ is singular if $\\operatorname{cf}(\\nu) < \\nu$. In our case, $\\nu = \\kappa = \\omega_{\\omega_1}$ and $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) = \\omega_1$.\nWe need to compare $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_{\\omega_1}$. The cardinal $\\omega_1$ can be identified with the ordinal index $1$ in the sequence of uncountable cardinals. The cardinal $\\omega_{\\omega_1}$ has the index $\\omega_1$. Since $1 < \\omega_1$ as ordinals, and the map $\\alpha \\mapsto \\omega_{\\alpha}$ is strictly increasing for $\\alpha \\ge 1$, it follows that $\\omega_1 < \\omega_{\\omega_1}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $\\operatorname{cf}(\\kappa) < \\kappa$.
