Why is $G \\cap D$ nonempty?\n2.  Why is $G \\cap D$ not necessarily a singleton?\n\n**1. Why $G \\cap D \\neq \\varnothing$**: This is true by the very definition of an $M$-generic filter, as stated in the problem: \"$G$ is $M$-generic if $G$ meets every dense subset of $\\mathbb{P}$ that belongs to $M$\". \"Meets\" means the intersection is nonempty.\n\n**2. Why $|G \\cap D| \\neq 1$ in general**: This depends on the structure of the dense set $D$.\n-   A filter $G$ is a set of pairwise compatible conditions. This follows from the 'directed' property: for any $p, q \\in G$, there exists $r \\in G$ which is a common strengthener ($r \\leq p$ and $r \\leq q$), which implies $p$ and $q$ are compatible.\n-   If $D$ is an antichain (a set of pairwise incompatible conditions), then $G \\cap D$ can contain at most one element. If it contained two distinct elements, $d_1, d_2$, then they would have to be compatible (as elements of $G$) and incompatible (as elements of the antichain $D$), a contradiction.\n-   However, a dense set $D$ is not required to be an antichain. $D$ can contain distinct, compatible conditions $d_1, d_2$. Let $r \\in \\mathbb{P}$ be a common strengthener ($r \\leq d_1$ and $r \\leq d_2$). It is possible for a generic filter $G$ to contain such a condition $r$. If $r \\in G$, and assuming the standard filter definition (upward closed under weakening), then since $r \\leq d_1$ and $r \\leq d_2$, both $d_1$ and $d_2$ must also be in $G$. In this case, $\\{d_1, d_2\\} \\subseteq G \\cap D$, so the intersection is not a singleton.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. By the definition of $M$-genericity, $G$ meets every dense $D\\in M$, so $G\\cap D\\neq\\varnothing$ for all dense $D\\in M$.**\nThis statement is a direct and correct citation of the definition of an $M$-generic filter given in the problem. It correctly explains why the intersection must be nonempty.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Since $D$ is dense, it must be a maximal antichain, hence $G\\cap D$ contains exactly one element.**\nThis statement is incorrect because its premise is false. A dense set is not necessarily a maximal antichain. For example, if the partial order $\\mathbb{P}$ is not itself an antichain, then $\\mathbb{P}$ is a dense subset of itself which is not an antichain. While it is true that a generic filter intersects a maximal antichain from $M$ in exactly one point, this does not apply to all dense sets.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Filters in forcing are linearly ordered by $\\leq$, so $G$ cannot contain two distinct compatible elements of $D$, which forces $G\\cap D$ to be a singleton.**\nThis statement is incorrect because its premise is false. A filter $G$ is a subset of a partial order $\\mathbb{P}$, which is generally not linearly ordered. The elements of a filter are pairwise compatible, but not necessarily comparable. For instance, in Cohen forcing $\\mathbb{P}=\\operatorname{Fn}(\\omega,2,<\\omega)$, the conditions $p=\\{(0,0)\\}$ and $q=\\{(1,1)\\}$ are compatible but neither is stronger than the other. A filter can contain both $p$ and $q$ (e.g., if it contains their union, $r=\\{(0,0),(1,1)\\}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If $D$ is a maximal antichain in $M$, then $G\\cap D$ is exactly one condition, because incompatible conditions cannot both lie in a filter; without the antichain hypothesis, $D$ may contain compatible conditions, and then $G\\cap D$ need not be a singleton.**\nThis statement provides a complete and accurate analysis.\n- The first part correctly states that for a maximal antichain $D$, $|G \\cap D| = 1$. The reasoning is sound: $G \\cap D \\neq \\varnothing$ because any generic filter must meet any maximal antichain from $M$ (as they generate a dense set), and $|G \\cap D| \\leq 1$ because $G$ consists of compatible conditions while $D$ consists of incompatible ones.\n- The second part correctly identifies the reason why the intersection is not always a singleton: a general dense set $D$ is not required to be an antichain and may contain compatible elements. If a generic filter contains a common strengthener of two such elements in $D$, then both will be in the filter, making the intersection non-singleton.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. In Cohen forcing $\\mathbb{P}=\\operatorname{Fn}(\\omega,2,<\\omega)$ (the set of finite partial functions from $\\omega$ to $2$, ordered by extension), let $D=\\{p\\in \\mathbb{P}: 0\\in\\operatorname{dom}(p)\\}$. Then $D$ is dense and, for any $M$-generic $G$, the intersection $G\\cap D$ is infinite, showing that $G\\cap D$ need not be a singleton.**\nLet's verify this example. The partial order is $\\mathbb{P}=\\operatorname{Fn}(\\omega,2,<\\omega)$, where $p \\leq q$ means $p$ extends $q$ ($p \\supseteq q$).\n- **Is $D$ dense?** Yes. For any $q \\in \\mathbb{P}$, if $0 \\in \\operatorname{dom}(q)$, then $q \\in D$, and we can take $p=q$. If $0 \\notin \\operatorname{dom}(q)$, the condition $p = q \\cup \\{(0,0)\\}$ is in $D$ and $p \\leq q$. So $D$ is dense.\n- **Is $G \\cap D$ infinite?** Let $G$ be an $M$-generic filter. The union of its elements, $f_G = \\bigcup G$, is a total function $f_G: \\omega \\to 2$. The filter is $G = \\{p \\in \\mathbb{P} \\mid p \\subset f_G\\}$. For an element $p$ to be in $G \\cap D$, we need $p \\subset f_G$ and $0 \\in \\operatorname{dom}(p)$. Let $v = f_G(0)$. For each integer $n \\geq 1$, define $p_n = f_G \\restriction n$. Each $p_n$ is a finite function, is a subset of $f_G$, and contains $(0,v)$ in its domain. Thus, for all $n \\geq 1$, $p_n \\in G \\cap D$. Since all $p_n$ for $n \\geq 1$ are distinct, the set $G \\cap D$ is infinite.

The definitions provided for the countable chain condition (ccc), properness, and the preservation of $\\omega_1$ are standard within this field. The problem asks to evaluate the truth of four statements relating these concepts, which is a well-posed mathematical question.\n\n### Analysis of Statement A\n\nA. If $\\mathbb{P}$ satisfies ccc, then $\\omega_1$ is preserved in $V^{\\mathbb{P}}$.\n\nThis statement is **Correct**.\n\nThe preservation of $\\omega_1$ means that in the generic extension $V^{\\mathbb{P}}$, the ground model's first uncountable cardinal, $\\omega_1^V$, remains uncountable and regular.\n\n$1$. **Preservation of Uncountability (No Collapse):** We must show that $\\omega_1^V$ is not countable in $V^{\\mathbb{P}}$. This is equivalent to showing that forcing with $\\mathbb{P}$ does not add any new functions from $\\omega$ onto $\\omega_1^V$. Let $\\dot{f}$ be a $\\mathbb{P}$-name for a function from $\\omega$ to $\\omega_1^V$, i.e., $1 \\Vdash \\dot{f}: \\check{\\omega} \\to \\check{\\omega}_1^V$. For each $n \\in \\omega$, consider the set of possible values for $\\dot{f}(n)$. Let $S_n = \\{ \\alpha \\in \\omega_1^V \\mid \\exists p \\in \\mathbb{P} \\text{ such that } p \\Vdash \\dot{f}(\\check{n}) = \\check{\\alpha} \\}$. For any two distinct ordinals $\\alpha, \\beta \\in S_n$, if $p_\\alpha \\Vdash \\dot{f}(\\check{n}) = \\check{\\alpha}$ and $p_\\beta \\Vdash \\dot{f}(\\check{n}) = \\check{\\beta}$, then $p_\\alpha$ and $p_\\beta$ must be incompatible (as they force contradictory information about the value of $\\dot{f}(n)$). Thus, for each $n \\in \\omega$, if we choose one such condition for each $\\alpha \\in S_n$, we obtain an antichain. Since $\\mathbb{P}$ satisfies the ccc, any antichain is countable. Therefore, each set $S_n$ must be countable.\n\nThe range of the function $f$ in the generic extension $V[G]$ is a subset of the union $S = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\omega} S_n$. As a countable union of countable sets, $S$ is countable in the ground model $V$. Since $\\omega_1^V$ is regular in $V$, the supremum of the countable set $S$, let's call it $\\gamma = \\sup S$, must be a countable ordinal, i.e., $\\gamma < \\omega_1^V$. This implies that the range of $f$ is bounded below $\\omega_1^V$. Since this holds for any such function $f \\in V^{\\mathbb{P}}$, no function from $\\omega$ to $\\omega_1^V$ in the extension can be surjective. Thus, $\\omega_1^V$ remains uncountable in $V^{\\mathbb{P}}$.\n\n$2$. **Preservation of Regularity:** The same argument shows that no new cofinal sequence of type $\\omega$ is added to $\\omega_1^V$. Any countable subset of $\\omega_1^V$ in the extension is contained in a countable set from the ground model, which has a supremum below $\\omega_1^V$. Therefore, the cofinality of $\\omega_1^V$ remains uncountable. Since $\\omega_1^V$ is regular in $V$, its cofinality is $\\omega_1^V$. In $V^{\\mathbb{P}}$, it remains a regular cardinal.\n\nThus, ccc forcing preserves $\\omega_1$.\n\n### Analysis of Statement B\n\nB. If $\\mathbb{P}$ is proper, then $\\omega_1$ is preserved in $V^{\\mathbb{P}}$, and there exist proper forcing notions which are not ccc.\n\nThis statement is **Correct**. It consists of two claims.\n\n$1$. **Proper forcing preserves $\\omega_1$:** This is a foundational result in the theory of proper forcing, due to Saharon Shelah. The proof is significantly more involved than the ccc case. It relies on the definition of properness involving countable elementary submodels. The essence of the proof is to show that for any name $\\dot{a}$ for a countable subset of $\\omega_1^V$ in the generic extension, there is a condition forcing $\\dot{a}$ to be contained within a countable set from the ground model $V$. This is established by taking a countable elementary submodel $M$ containing the relevant names and using an $M$-generic condition $q$ to show that any new ordinals named in $M$ are forced by $q$ to lie below the ordinal $\\delta = M \\cap \\omega_1^V$. Since $\\delta$ is a countable ordinal, this effectively bounds the new countable sets of ordinals, which is sufficient to prove that $\\omega_1^V$ is not collapsed and no new cofinal sequences are added. The definition of properness provided in the problem statement, while appearing weaker than some textbook definitions, is known to be an equivalent characterization and is sufficient to establish this result.\n\n$2$. **Existence of proper forcings that are not ccc:** This is also true. A large class of examples is given by $\\kappa$-closed forcings for an uncountable cardinal $\\kappa$. A forcing $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\kappa$-closed if every descending sequence of conditions of length less than $\\kappa$ has a lower bound. Any $\\omega_1$-closed forcing is proper.\nConsider the forcing $\\mathbb{P}$ to add a CLUB set to $\\omega_1$. Conditions are countable closed subsets of $\\omega_1$, and $p \\le q$ if $p$ is an end-extension of $q$. This forcing is $\\omega_1$-closed and therefore proper. However, it is not ccc. For any two distinct countable ordinals $\\alpha, \\beta < \\omega_1$, the conditions $p_\\alpha = \\{\\alpha\\}$ and $p_\\beta = \\{\\beta\\}$ are incompatible (no condition can be an end-extension of both). The set $\\{ \\{\\alpha\\} \\mid \\alpha < \\omega_1 \\}$ is an antichain of size $\\aleph_1$, which is uncountable.\nAnother example is the forcing to collapse a cardinal greater than $\\omega_1$, e.g., $\\text{Col}(\\omega_1, \\omega_2)$, the set of countable partial functions from $\\omega_1$ to $\\omega_2$. This is $\\omega_1$-closed and hence proper, but it has antichains of size $\\aleph_2$.\n\n### Analysis of Statement C\n\nC. For every stationary set $S \\subseteq \\omega_1$ in $V$, every ccc forcing $\\mathbb{P}$ preserves the stationarity of $S$ in $V^{\\mathbb{P}}$, while there exists a proper forcing that destroys the stationarity of some $S \\subseteq \\omega_1$.\n\nThis statement is **Correct**. It also consists of two claims.\n\n$1$. **Ccc forcing preserves stationarity:** This is another fundamental result about ccc forcings, a theorem of Solovay. A set $S \\subseteq \\omega_1$ is stationary if it intersects every closed, unbounded (club) set in $\\omega_1$. The proof shows that if $\\dot{C}$ is a name for a club set in the extension, then one can construct a club set $D$ in the ground model $V$ such that any condition forces that many elements of $D$ are in $\\dot{C}$. Since $S$ is stationary in $V$, $S \\cap D \\neq \\emptyset$. This intersection point can then be used to find a condition that forces an intersection between $S$ and $\\dot{C}$, proving $S$ remains stationary in $V^{\\mathbb{P}}$. The ccc property is crucial in \"pulling down\" information about the generic club $\\dot{C}$ into a ground model club $D$.\n\n$2$. **Proper forcing can destroy stationarity:** This is a key feature distinguishing properness from the ccc. Let $S \\subseteq \\omega_1$ be a stationary set whose complement $T = \\omega_1 \\setminus S$ is also stationary. (The existence of such a partition of $\\omega_1$ is a standard ZFC fact.) Consider the forcing notion $\\mathbb{P}_T$ consisting of all countable closed subsets of $T$, ordered by end-extension. As argued in the analysis of statement B, this forcing is $\\omega_1$-closed and therefore proper. Let $G$ be a $\\mathbb{P}_T$-generic filter over $V$. In the extension $V[G]$, the set $C = \\bigcup G$ is a club set in $\\omega_1$. By construction, every condition is a subset of $T$, so the union $C$ is a subset of $T$. Thus, $C \\cap S = \\emptyset$. Since $S$ is disjoint from the club set $C$ in the extension $V[G]$, $S$ is no longer stationary in $V[G]$.\n\n### Analysis of Statement D\n\nD. Every proper forcing is ccc.\n\nThis statement is **False**.\n\nAs established in the analysis of statement B, there exist forcing notions that are proper but not ccc. The counterexamples provided, such as $\\omega_1$-closed forcings like adding a CLUB to $\\omega_1$ or collapsing $\\omega_2$ with countable conditions (e.g., $\\text{Col}(\\omega_1, \\omega_2)$), are proper but possess uncountable antichains.

An ultrafilter $G \\subseteq \\mathbb{B}$ is $M$-generic if for every dense set $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{B}$ such that $D \\in M$, we have $G \\cap D \\neq \\emptyset$.

An ill-founded model possesses an infinite descending sequence with respect to its membership relation $\\in^U$.

The condition $[\\sigma]_U \\in^U [\\tau]_U$ is by definition equivalent to $\\llbracket \\sigma \\in \\tau \\rrbracket^{\\mathbb{B}} \\in U$.\n    The standard interpretation $\\operatorname{val}_G(\\tau)$ is defined recursively as $\\operatorname{val}_G(\\tau) = \\{ \\operatorname{val}_G(\\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in \\operatorname{dom}(\\tau) \\text{ and } \\tau(\\sigma) \\in G \\}$. A proof by transfinite induction on the ranks of names shows that these two definitions coincide: $\\pi([\\tau]_U) = \\operatorname{val}_G(\\tau)$. A key step in this proof relies on the $M$-genericity of $G$ to show that if a supremum of a set of Boolean values (from $M$) is in $G$, then some member of that set must be in $G$.\n2.  **The Forcing Theorem**: The equivalence $M[G] \\models \\varphi(\\operatorname{val}_{G}(\\vec{\\tau})) \\iff \\llbracket \\varphi(\\vec{\\tau}) \\rrbracket^{\\mathbb{B}} \\in G$ is the fundamental theorem of forcing, often called the Truth Lemma. It connects truth in the generic extension $M[G]$ to the Boolean values of formulas in $M^{\\mathbb{B}}$.\n\nSince both parts of the statement are standard and correct theorems, the entire statement necessarily holds.\n\n**C. For any ultrafilter $U \\subseteq \\mathbb{B}$ (not necessarily $M$-generic), the quotient $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ is automatically well-founded, so no collapse is needed to obtain a transitive model.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**.\nAs explained in the analysis of option A, the well-foundedness of the quotient model $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ is not automatic. It is a special property that holds if and only if the ultrafilter $U$ is $M$-generic. If $U$ is not $M$-generic, there exists a dense set $D \\in M$ such that $U \\cap D = \\emptyset$, and this fact can be used to construct an infinite descending sequence $\\dots \\in^U [\\tau_2]_U \\in^U [\\tau_1]_U \\in^U [\\tau_0]_U$ within the model $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$. Thus, for a non-generic ultrafilter, the model is ill-founded.\n\n**D. The quotient $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ is a two-valued model in the sense that for every sentence $\\psi$ in the language of set theory, $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U \\models \\psi$ if and only if $\\llbracket \\psi \\rrbracket^{\\mathbb{B}} \\in U$.**\n\nThis statement is **Correct**.\nThis is a statement of Łoś's Theorem as it applies to Boolean-valued models. The theorem holds for **any** ultrafilter $U$, not just generic ones. It is proven by induction on the complexity of the formula $\\psi$. The base cases for $\\in$ and $=$ are true by definition of the relations $\\in^U$ and $\\sim_U$. The induction steps for propositional connectives follow from the properties of ultrafilters (e.g., $p \\wedge q \\in U \\iff p \\in U \\text{ and } q \\in U$). The quantifier step (e.g., for $\\exists$) requires a more sophisticated argument. One must show that $\\llbracket \\exists x \\varphi(x) \\rrbracket^{\\mathbb{B}} \\in U$ is equivalent to the existence of a name $\\tau$ such that $\\llbracket \\varphi(\\tau) \\rrbracket^{\\mathbb{B}} \\in U$. This equivalence is guaranteed by the \"witnessing theorem\" (or mixing lemma) in Boolean-valued models, which asserts that for any formula $\\varphi(x)$, there exists a name $\\tau_0$ such that $\\llbracket \\varphi(\\tau_0) \\rrbracket^{\\mathbb{B}} = \\llbracket \\exists x \\varphi(x) \\rrbracket^{\\mathbb{B}}$. This ensures the equivalence holds for any ultrafilter $U$. The term \"two-valued model\" is appropriate, as for any sentence $\\psi$, either $\\llbracket \\psi \\rrbracket^\\mathbb{B} \\in U$ or $\\llbracket \\neg\\psi \\rrbracket^\\mathbb{B} = \\neg\\llbracket\\psi\\rrbracket^\\mathbb{B} \\in U$, so either $\\psi$ or its negation holds in $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$.\n\n**E. If $U$ is an ultrafilter on $\\mathbb{B}$ that is not $M$-generic, then $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ still satisfies the forcing theorem over $M$ and necessarily contains all the generic reals that would be added by forcing with $\\mathbb{B}$.**\n\nThis statement is **Incorrect**.\nIf $U$ is not $M$-generic, $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ is an ill-founded model. The \"forcing theorem\" is integrally linked to a well-founded generic extension $M[G]$. Since $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ is not isomorphic to any such $M[G]$, the forcing theorem in its usual sense (connecting truth in $M[G]$ to forcing conditions) does not apply. While Łoś's Theorem (Option D) holds, it does not equate the model with a generic extension. The second part of the claim, that the model \"necessarily contains all the generic reals\", is false. A generic real is an object in a specific generic extension $M[G]$, determined by the generic filter $G$. An ill-founded model like $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ resulting from a non-generic $U$ is a different kind of object entirely (an ultrapower of the Boolean-valued model) and has no reason to contain generic objects from arbitrary generic extensions.\n\n**F. If $U$ is $M$-generic, then $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ is well-founded and extensional, and its Mostowski collapse $\\pi \\colon M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U \\to N$ is a transitive model $N$ isomorphic to $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ with $\\pi([\\tau]_{U}) = \\operatorname{val}_{G}(\\tau)$ for all $\\tau \\in M^{\\mathbb{B}}$, hence $N = M[G]$.**\n\nThis statement is **Correct**. Let $G=U$.\nThis statement provides a detailed and accurate summary of the construction of a generic extension via the quotient method.\n1.  **Well-founded and extensional**: As established before, if $U$ is $M$-generic, $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$ is well-founded. It is extensional because the Axiom of Extensionality has Boolean value $\\mathbb{1}_{\\mathbb{B}}$, which is in any filter $U$. By Łoś's Theorem (D), the axiom holds in $M^{\\mathbb{B}}/U$.\n2.  **Mostowski collapse**: For any class-sized structure with a set-like, well-founded, and extensional relation, the Mostowski-Shepherdson collapse theorem guarantees a unique isomorphism $\\pi$ to a transitive class $N$ with the standard $\\in$ relation.\n3.  **Identity with $\\operatorname{val}_G$**: As established in the analysis of B, the identity $\\pi([\\tau]_{U}) = \\operatorname{val}_{G}(\\tau)$ is a fundamental theorem connecting the algebraic quotient construction with the direct interpretation of names.\n4.  **Identity of models $N = M[G]$**: The generic extension $M[G]$ is defined as the class of all interpretations of names, i.e., $M[G] = \\{ \\operatorname{val}_G(\\tau) \\mid \\tau \\in M^{\\mathbb{B}} \\}$. The universe of the collapsed model $N$ is the image of the collapse map, $N = \\{ \\pi([\\tau]_U) \\mid \\tau \\in M^{\\mathbb{B}} \\}$. Given the identity from the previous point, it follows directly that $N = M[G]$.\n\nThus, the statement is a correct and complete description of the relationship.\n\n### Conclusion\nStatements B, D, and F are all correct theorems in the theory of forcing and Boolean-valued models.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDF}$$", "id": "2974660"}]}
