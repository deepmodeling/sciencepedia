A finite binary sequence $p$ is a function $p: n \\to \\{0,1\\}$ for some natural number $n \\in \\omega$, where $n$ is the length of $p$.\n- The partial order on $\\mathbb{P}$ is defined by extension: for $p, q \\in \\mathbb{P}$, $p \\leq q$ if and only if $p \\supseteq q$.

All terms are formally defined and are standard within the field. The problem is self-contained, unambiguous, and does not violate any mathematical or logical principles. It is well-posed and has a unique, verifiable answer. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Proving $G_x$ is a nontrivial proper filter\n\nWe are given $G_x = \\{x \\upharpoonright n : n \\in \\omega\\}$. We must show that $G_x$ is a filter, that it is nontrivial (nonempty), and that it is proper ($G_x \\neq \\mathbb{P}$).\n\n1.  **$G_x$ is a filter:**\n    - **Nonempty:** For $n=0$, the initial segment $x \\upharpoonright 0$ is the empty sequence, denoted $\\emptyset$. The empty sequence is a finite binary sequence, so $\\emptyset \\in \\mathbb{P}$. By definition of $G_x$, $\\emptyset \\in G_x$. Therefore, $G_x$ is nonempty.\n    - **Upward closed:** Let $p \\in G_x$ and $q \\in \\mathbb{P}$ be such that $p \\leq q$. We must show that $q \\in G_x$.\n      Since $p \\in G_x$, there exists some $n \\in \\omega$ such that $p = x \\upharpoonright n$.\n      The condition $p \\leq q$ means $p \\supseteq q$.\n      So, we have $x \\upharpoonright n \\supseteq q$. This implies that $q$ is an initial segment of $x \\upharpoonright n$.\n      If $q$ is an initial segment of $x \\upharpoonright n$, then $q$ must be of the form $(x \\upharpoonright n) \\upharpoonright m$ for some $m \\leq n$. This is simply $x \\upharpoonright m$.\n      Since $m \\in \\omega$, $q = x \\upharpoonright m$ is an element of $G_x$ by definition.\n      Thus, $G_x$ is upward closed.\n    - **Downward directed:** Let $p, q \\in G_x$. We need to find an $r \\in G_x$ such that $r \\leq p$ and $r \\leq q$.\n      Since $p, q \\in G_x$, there exist $n_1, n_2 \\in \\omega$ such that $p = x \\upharpoonright n_1$ and $q = x \\upharpoonright n_2$.\n      Let $n_3 = \\max(n_1, n_2)$. Let $r = x \\upharpoonright n_3$.\n      By definition, $r \\in G_x$.\n      The sequence $r = x \\upharpoonright n_3$ is an extension of both $p = x \\upharpoonright n_1$ and $q = x \\upharpoonright n_2$. So, $r \\supseteq p$ and $r \\supseteq q$.\n      According to the order definition, this means $r \\leq p$ and $r \\leq q$.\n      Thus, $G_x$ is downward directed.\n      Since $G_x$ is nonempty, upward closed, and downward directed, it is a filter.\n\n2.  **$G_x$ is nontrivial and proper:**\n    - **Nontrivial:** As shown above, $\\emptyset \\in G_x$, so $G_x$ is nonempty.\n    - **Proper:** To show $G_x \\neq \\mathbb{P}$, we must exhibit an element of $\\mathbb{P}$ that is not in $G_x$. Let $x(0)$ be the first bit of the infinite sequence $x$. Consider the finite sequence $p = \\langle 1-x(0) \\rangle$ of length $1$. This $p$ is an element of $\\mathbb{P}$. However, $p$ is not an initial segment of $x$ because $p(0) \\neq x(0)$. Therefore, $p \\notin G_x$. This demonstrates that $G_x$ is a proper subset of $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nIn conclusion, $G_x$ is a nontrivial proper filter on $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\n### Part 2: Determining if $G_x$ is a maximal filter\n\nA filter $G$ is maximal if no strictly larger filter $H$ (i.e., $G \\subsetneq H$) exists. To prove $G_x$ is maximal, we will show that for any element $p \\in \\mathbb{P} \\setminus G_x$, the set $G_x \\cup \\{p\\}$ cannot be extended to a filter. This is equivalent to showing that for any $p \\notin G_x$, there is some $q \\in G_x$ that is incompatible with $p$.\n\nTwo conditions $p_1, p_2 \\in \\mathbb{P}$ are **incompatible** if they have no common lower bound in the poset, i.e., there is no $r \\in \\mathbb{P}$ such that $r \\leq p_1$ and $r \\leq p_2$. In our poset, this is equivalent to having no common extension $r$ such that $r \\supseteq p_1$ and $r \\supseteq p_2$. This occurs if and only if $p_1$ and $p_2$ differ at some coordinate, i.e., there exists an index $i  \\min(\\operatorname{len}(p_1), \\operatorname{len}(p_2))$ such that $p_1(i) \\neq p_2(i)$.\n\nLet's proceed with the proof of maximality. Let $p \\in \\mathbb{P}$ be an arbitrary element such that $p \\notin G_x$. We want to find a $q \\in G_x$ that is incompatible with $p$.\n\nSince $p \\notin G_x$, $p$ is not an initial segment of the infinite sequence $x$. This means that there must be a first position at which $p$ and $x$ differ. Let $k = \\operatorname{len}(p)$ be the length of $p$. Let $i_0$ be the smallest integer $i  k$ such that $p(i) \\neq x(i)$. Such an $i_0$ must exist, otherwise $p$ would be an initial segment of $x$.\n\nNow, let's choose a condition $q$ from our filter $G_x$. A suitable choice is $q = x \\upharpoonright (i_0+1)$.\n- By definition, $q \\in G_x$.\n- The length of $q$ is $i_0+1$.\n- At index $i_0$, we have $q(i_0) = (x \\upharpoonright (i_0+1))(i_0) = x(i_0)$.\n- By our choice of $i_0$, we have $p(i_0) \\neq x(i_0)$.\n- Therefore, $p(i_0) \\neq q(i_0)$.\n\nSince $p$ and $q$ are finite sequences that differ at the coordinate $i_0$, they are incompatible. No sequence $r$ can be an extension of both $p$ and $q$, because such a sequence would need to satisfy $r(i_0) = p(i_0)$ and $r(i_0) = q(i_0)$, a contradiction.\n\nSo, for any $p \\notin G_x$, we have found an element $q \\in G_x$ that is incompatible with $p$.\nNow, suppose for contradiction that $G_x$ is not maximal. Then there exists a filter $H$ such that $G_x \\subsetneq H$. This implies there is an element $p \\in H$ with $p \\notin G_x$.\nSince $H$ is a filter and $G_x \\subset H$, for any $q \\in G_x$, we have $q \\in H$.\nFrom our argument above, we know there exists a $q \\in G_x$ which is incompatible with $p$.\nSince $p \\in H$ and $q \\in H$, by the downward-directed property of the filter $H$, there must exist some $r \\in H$ such that $r \\leq p$ and $r \\leq q$.\nBut this means $r$ is a common extension of $p$ and $q$. This is impossible, as we established that $p$ and $q$ are incompatible.\nThis contradiction shows that our initial assumption (that $G_x$ is not maximal) must be false.\n\nTherefore, $G_x$ is a maximal filter on $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\n### Part 3: Computing $M(G_x)$\nThe indicator function $M(G_x)$ is defined as:\n$$\nM(G_{x})=\\begin{cases}\n1,  \\text{if $G_{x}$ is a maximal filter on $\\mathbb{P}$}, \\\\\n0,  \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSince we have proven that $G_x$ is a maximal filter for any infinite binary sequence $x \\in 2^{\\omega}$, the value of the indicator is $1$.\n$M(G_x) = 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2973315"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of filters, we can now explore the mechanics of forcing itself, specifically how conditions in a poset determine the properties of the new 'generic' object.

This is equivalent to $\\{k_1, \\dots, k_n\\} \\subseteq \\operatorname{dom}(q)$.\n\nWe are given a condition $p \\in \\mathbb{P}$ such that $\\operatorname{dom}(p) \\cap \\{0, 1, \\dots, m+n-1\\} = \\varnothing$.\n\n### Task 1: Construction of condition $q$\n\nWe are asked to construct a condition $q \\leq p$ that decides the value of the tuple $(\\dot{c}(0), \\dot{c}(1), \\dots, \\dot{c}(m-1))$.\n\nThis requires finding a $q$ such that for a unique sequence $s \\in 2^m$, $q \\Vdash (\\dot{c}(0), \\dots, \\dot{c}(m-1)) = \\check{s}$. This translates to requiring $q \\Vdash \\dot{c}(\\check{i}) = \\check{s(i)}$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$. Based on the forcing definition, this means we must have $(i, s(i)) \\in q$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$.\n\nLet's choose an arbitrary sequence $s \\in 2^m$. For concreteness, let $s$ be the sequence where $s(i)=0$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$. Define a finite function $f_s = \\{(i, s(i)) \\mid i \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}\\}$. The domain of $f_s$ is $\\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$.\n\nWe need to construct a condition $q$ such that $q \\leq p$ (i.e., $q \\supseteq p$) and $q$ contains the information in $f_s$. The natural choice for $q$ is the union of the functions $p$ and $f_s$:\n$$q = p \\cup f_s = p \\cup \\{(i, s(i)) \\mid i \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}\\}$$\nTo be a valid condition in $\\mathbb{P}$, $q$ must be a function. This is true if the domains of $p$ and $f_s$ are disjoint. We are given $\\operatorname{dom}(p) \\cap \\{0, 1, \\dots, m+n-1\\} = \\varnothing$. Since $\\operatorname{dom}(f_s) = \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\} \\subset \\{0, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$, it follows that $\\operatorname{dom}(p) \\cap \\operatorname{dom}(f_s) = \\varnothing$. Thus, $q$ is a valid finite partial function from $\\omega$ to $2$, so $q \\in \\mathbb{P}$.\n\nBy construction, $q \\supseteq p$, which means $q \\leq p$.\nAlso by construction, for each $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$, we have $(i, s(i)) \\in q$. This implies $q \\Vdash \\dot{c}(\\check{i}) = \\check{s(i)}$. Therefore, $q$ decides the tuple $(\\dot{c}(0), \\dots, \\dot{c}(m-1))$ to be the sequence $s$. The sequence $s$ is unique for $q$, as if $q$ also decided the tuple to be $s' \\neq s$, then for some $i$, $q$ would contain both $(i, s(i))$ and $(i, s'(i))$ with $s(i) \\neq s'(i)$, contradicting that $q$ is a function.\n\nAs a specific example, we can construct $q = p \\cup \\{(0,0), (1,0), \\dots, (m-1,0)\\}$. This condition is stronger than $p$ and decides the first $m$ values of $\\dot{c}$ to all be $0$.\n\n### Task 2: Refinement to condition $r$\n\nWe are asked to refine $q$ to a stronger condition $r \\leq q$ that decides the longer tuple $(\\dot{c}(0), \\dots, \\dot{c}(m+n-1))$. Let $q$ be the condition constructed in Task 1 for a sequence $s \\in 2^m$.\n$$q = p \\cup \\{(i, s(i)) \\mid i  m\\}$$\nWe want to construct $r \\leq q$ such that $r$ decides the values of $\\dot{c}$ for inputs $\\{0, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$. This means the domain of $r$ must contain this set. The condition $q$ already decides the values for $\\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$. We need to extend it to also decide the values for $\\{m, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$.\n\nThe logic is identical to Task 1. Let's choose an arbitrary sequence $t \\in 2^n$. This sequence will specify the values for $\\dot{c}(m), \\dots, \\dot{c}(m+n-1)$. Define a finite function $g_t = \\{(m+j, t(j)) \\mid j \\in \\{0, \\dots, n-1\\}\\}$. The domain of $g_t$ is $\\{m, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$.\n\nLet's define $r$ as the union of the functions $q$ and $g_t$:\n$$r = q \\cup g_t = p \\cup \\{(i, s(i)) \\mid i  m\\} \\cup \\{(m+j, t(j)) \\mid j  n\\}$$\nThe domain of $q$ is $\\operatorname{dom}(p) \\cup \\{0, \\dots, m-1\\}$. The domain of $g_t$ is $\\{m, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$.\nFrom the problem's premise, $\\operatorname{dom}(p)$ is disjoint from $\\{0, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$, which contains both $\\operatorname{dom}(f_s)$ and $\\operatorname{dom}(g_t)$. Also, $\\operatorname{dom}(f_s)$ and $\\operatorname{dom}(g_t)$ are disjoint. Therefore, the union defining $r$ is a union of functions with disjoint domains, so $r$ is a valid condition in $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nBy construction, $r \\supseteq q$, so $r \\leq q$.\nLet $u \\in 2^{m+n}$ be the sequence formed by concatenating $s$ and $t$. For any $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$, we have $(k, u(k)) \\in r$. Thus, $r \\Vdash \\dot{c}(\\check{k}) = \\check{u(k)}$. This demonstrates that $r$ decides the tuple $(\\dot{c}(0), \\dots, \\dot{c}(m+n-1))$ to be the sequence $u$.\n\n### Task 3: Cardinality of a maximal antichain\n\nWe need to find the cardinality of a maximal antichain $A_{m+n}$ below $p$, where every condition $a \\in A_{m+n}$ decides the tuple $(\\dot{c}(0), \\dots, \\dot{c}(m+n-1))$.\n\nFirst, let's construct one such maximal antichain. A condition decides the tuple if its domain includes the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$. For each possible outcome, which is a sequence $u \\in 2^{m+n}$, we can define a minimal condition below $p$ that forces this outcome. Let $S = 2^{m+n}$ be the set of all binary sequences of length $m+n$. The size of this set is $|S| = 2^{m+n}$. For each $u \\in S$, define the condition:\n$$c_u = p \\cup \\{(i, u(i)) \\mid i \\in \\{0, \\dots, m+n-1\\}\\}$$\nAs established before, each $c_u$ is a valid condition in $\\mathbb{P}$ and $c_u \\leq p$. By construction, each $c_u$ decides the initial segment of $\\dot{c}$ to be $u$.\n\nLet $C = \\{c_u \\mid u \\in S\\}$.\n1.  Is $C$ an antichain? Let $c_{u_1}, c_{u_2} \\in C$ with $u_1 \\neq u_2$. Then there exists some $k \\in \\{0, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$ such that $u_1(k) \\neq u_2(k)$. By construction, $(k, u_1(k)) \\in c_{u_1}$ and $(k, u_2(k)) \\in c_{u_2}$. Any common extension $r \\leq c_{u_1}, c_{u_2}$ would have to contain both pairs, meaning $r$ would not be a function. Thus, no such $r$ exists, and $c_{u_1}, c_{u_2}$ are incompatible. So, $C$ is an antichain.\n\n2.  Is $C$ a maximal antichain below $p$? Let $q \\leq p$ be an arbitrary condition. We must show $q$ is compatible with some element of $C$. Define a partial function $u_q$ by restricting $q$ to $\\{0, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$. Let $u$ be any total function in $2^{m+n}$ that extends $u_q$. Consider the condition $c_u \\in C$. To check if $q$ and $c_u$ are compatible, we check if their union is a function.\n$q \\cup c_u = q \\cup (p \\cup \\{(i, u(i)) \\mid i  m+n\\})$. Since $q \\supseteq p$, this is just $q \\cup \\{(i, u(i)) \\mid i  m+n\\}$. For this to be a function, the values must agree on the intersection of the domains, which is $\\operatorname{dom}(q) \\cap \\{0, \\dots, m+n-1\\}$. For any $k$ in this intersection, $q(k) = u_q(k)$. Since $u$ extends $u_q$, we have $u(k) = u_q(k)$. Thus, $q(k)=u(k)$, so their union is a function and forms a valid condition $r \\in \\mathbb{P}$. Since $r \\leq q$ and $r \\leq c_u$, $q$ and $c_u$ are compatible. Thus, $C$ is a maximal antichain below $p$.\n\nThe construction of $C$ creates a distinct condition $c_u$ for each unique sequence $u \\in S$. The map $u \\mapsto c_u$ is a bijection from $S$ to $C$. Therefore, the cardinality of $C$ is $|C| = |S| = 2^{m+n}$.\n\nNow we must show that any maximal antichain $A_{m+n}$ with the given properties has this same cardinality. Let $A$ be such an antichain. Let $C$ be the maximal antichain we constructed above. Both $A$ and $C$ are maximal antichains in the sub-poset $\\mathbb{P}/p = \\{q \\in \\mathbb{P} \\mid q \\leq p\\}$.\n\nFor each $a \\in A$, since $C$ is a maximal antichain below $p$, there exists at least one $c \\in C$ such that $a$ and $c$ are compatible. Let $a$ decide the sequence $u_a$ and $c$ decide $u_c$. If $a$ and $c$ are compatible, there exists $r \\leq a, c$. Then $r$ must force both outcomes, so $u_a = u_c$.\n\nNow, suppose an element $a \\in A$ is compatible with two distinct elements $c_1, c_2 \\in C$. This implies $u_a = u_{c_1}$ and $u_a = u_{c_2}$. So $u_{c_1} = u_{c_2}$. But the map $u \\mapsto c_u$ is a bijection, so $c_1=c_2$. This is a contradiction. Therefore, each element $a \\in A$ is compatible with exactly one element of $C$. This defines a function $\\psi: A \\to C$.\n\nBy a symmetric argument, for each $c \\in C$, since $A$ is a maximal antichain below $p$, there exists exactly one $a \\in A$ which is compatible with $c$. This defines a function $\\theta: C \\to A$.\n\nThe functions $\\psi$ and $\\theta$ are inverses. If $\\psi(a)=c$, it means $a$ and $c$ are the unique compatible pair. Then $\\theta(c)$ must be $a$. Thus $\\theta \\circ \\psi = \\mathrm{id}_A$ and $\\psi \\circ \\theta = \\mathrm{id}_C$. This establishes a bijection between $A$ and $C$.\n\nTherefore, $|A| = |C|$. Since $|C| = 2^{m+n}$, the cardinality of any such maximal antichain $A_{m+n}$ is $2^{m+n}$.\n\nThe final answer is a closed-form expression for this cardinality. Given integers $m$ and $n$, the cardinality is $2^{m+n}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2^{m+n}}$$", "id": "2973305"}, {"introduction": "Forcing is a remarkably versatile tool with applications far beyond adding real numbers.

By working through this problem, you will see how forcing can add a new closed unbounded (club) set to $\\omega_1$, thereby making a stationary set from the ground model become nonstationary in the extension [@problem_id:2973304]. This reveals the profound power of forcing to alter the very fabric of the set-theoretic universe.", "problem": "Work in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Let $S=\\{\\alpha\\omega_{1}:\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha)=\\omega\\}$ be the set of ordinals below $\\omega_{1}$ having countable cofinality, which is stationary and costationary in $\\omega_{1}$. Define the poset $\\mathbb{P}$ as follows: a condition $c\\in\\mathbb{P}$ is a closed, countable subset of $S$ that has a maximum element $\\max(c)$, and the order is end-extension, i.e., for $d,c\\in\\mathbb{P}$,\n$$\nd\\leq c\\quad\\text{iff}\\quad c\\subseteq d\\ \\text{and}\\ \\forall \\beta\\in d\\setminus c\\ \\big(\\beta\\max(c)\\big).\n$$\nUsing only fundamental definitions of forcing, generic filters, $\\omega$-closure, the countable chain condition (CCC), clubs and stationary sets on $\\omega_{1}$, and the fact that a real is a function from $\\omega$ to $\\omega$, complete the following:\n\n1.

All definitions are standard and the premises are factually correct within ZFC. The tasks are mathematically well-posed and build upon each other in a logical manner.\n\n### 1. Verification that $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\omega$-closed\n\nTo verify that the poset $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\omega$-closed, we must show that any decreasing sequence of conditions $\\langle c_n : n  \\omega \\rangle$ has a lower bound in $\\mathbb{P}$. A decreasing sequence is one where $c_0 \\geq c_1 \\geq c_2 \\geq \\dots$, which means $c_{n+1} \\leq c_n$ for all $n \\in \\omega$.\n\nAccording to the definition of the order on $\\mathbb{P}$, $d \\leq c$ if and only if $c \\subseteq d$ and for all $\\beta \\in d \\setminus c$, we have $\\beta  \\max(c)$. Therefore, the sequence $c_0 \\geq c_1 \\geq c_2 \\geq \\dots$ corresponds to a sequence of sets such that for each $n \\in \\omega$, $c_n \\subseteq c_{n+1}$ and every element in $c_{n+1} \\setminus c_n$ is greater than $\\max(c_n)$. This implies that the sequence of maximum elements $\\langle \\max(c_n) : n  \\omega \\rangle$ is a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals.\n\nLet's construct a lower bound for the sequence $\\langle c_n \\rangle_{n\\omega}$.\nLet $\\alpha = \\sup \\{ \\max(c_n) : n  \\omega \\}$. Since each $\\max(c_n)  \\omega_1$ and this is a supremum of a countable set of countable ordinals, $\\alpha  \\omega_1$. As it is the supremum of a strictly increasing $\\omega$-sequence of ordinals, its cofinality is $\\omega$. Thus, $\\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha) = \\omega$, which implies $\\alpha \\in S$.\n\nDefine a set $c_\\omega = \\bigcup_{n  \\omega} c_n$. Let our candidate for the lower bound be $d = c_\\omega \\cup \\{\\alpha\\}$. We must now verify that $d \\in \\mathbb{P}$.\n\n1.  **Countable subset of $S$**: Each $c_n$ is a countable subset of $S$. A countable union of countable sets, $c_\\omega$, is countable. Adding the single element $\\alpha \\in S$ to $c_\\omega$ results in a countable set $d$, which is a subset of $S$.\n\n2.  **Closed set**: We need to show that $d$ is topologically closed in the order topology on $\\omega_1$. Let $\\gamma$ be a limit point of $d$. This means $\\gamma = \\sup(d \\cap \\gamma)$.\n    -   If there is an $n \\in \\omega$ such that $\\gamma \\leq \\max(c_n)$, then the sequence converging to $\\gamma$ from below must be contained in $c_k$ for some sufficiently large $k$. Since each $c_k$ is closed, any limit point of $c_k$ is in $c_k$. Specifically, if the set of points in $d$ converging to $\\gamma$ is contained in $c_k$, then $\\gamma \\in c_k \\subseteq d$. The points in $d \\setminus c_k$ are all greater than $\\max(c_k)$. So if $\\gamma \\leq \\max(c_k)$, the points of $d$ forming the sequence converging to $\\gamma$ must eventually be in $c_k$.\n    -   The only other case is when the sequence converging to $\\gamma$ is not bounded by any $\\max(c_n)$. This implies that $\\gamma \\geq \\sup \\{ \\max(c_n) : n  \\omega \\} = \\alpha$. However, since $\\sup(d) = \\alpha$, there can be no limit points strictly greater than $\\alpha$. So, the only remaining limit point to check is $\\gamma = \\alpha$. The sequence $\\langle \\max(c_n) : n  \\omega \\rangle$ is a subset of $d$ and converges to $\\alpha$, so $\\alpha$ is a limit point of $d$. By our construction, $\\alpha \\in d$.\n    Thus, $d$ contains all its limit points and is closed.\n\n3.  **Maximum element**: By construction, $\\alpha \\ge \\beta$ for all $\\beta \\in c_\\omega$, and $\\alpha \\in d$. So, $\\max(d) = \\alpha$.\n\nSince $d$ satisfies all three properties, $d \\in \\mathbb{P}$. Now we must verify that $d$ is a lower bound for the sequence $\\langle c_n \\rangle_{n\\omega}$, i.e., $d \\leq c_n$ for all $n \\in \\omega$. This requires:\n-   $c_n \\subseteq d$: This is true by construction, as $c_n \\subseteq c_\\omega \\subseteq d$.\n-   $\\forall \\beta \\in d \\setminus c_n, \\beta  \\max(c_n)$: Let $\\beta \\in d \\setminus c_n$. Then $\\beta \\in (\\bigcup_{k\\omega} c_k \\setminus c_n) \\cup \\{\\alpha\\}$.\n    -   If $\\beta \\in c_k$ for some $k  n$, then because $c_k$ is an end-extension of $c_n$, we have $\\beta  \\max(c_n)$.\n    -   If $\\beta = \\alpha$, then $\\alpha = \\sup_{k\\omega} \\max(c_k)  \\max(c_n)$ because the sequence of maxima is strictly increasing.\nIn both cases, the condition holds.\n\nTherefore, $d$ is a lower bound for the sequence $\\langle c_n \\rangle_{n\\omega}$. Since every countable decreasing sequence has a lower bound, $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\omega$-closed.\n\n### 2. Verification that $\\mathbb{P}$ is not CCC\n\nTo show that $\\mathbb{P}$ does not satisfy the countable chain condition (CCC), we must exhibit an uncountable antichain. An antichain is a subset of $\\mathbb{P}$ where any two distinct elements are incompatible. Two conditions $c,d \\in \\mathbb{P}$ are incompatible, denoted $c \\perp d$, if there is no $e \\in \\mathbb{P}$ such that $e \\leq c$ and $e \\leq d$.\n\nFor a condition $e$ to be a common extension of $c$ and $d$ ($e \\le c$ and $e \\le d$), we must have:\n-   $c \\subseteq e$ and $\\forall \\beta \\in e \\setminus c, \\beta  \\max(c)$.\n-   $d \\subseteq e$ and $\\forall \\beta \\in e \\setminus d, \\beta  \\max(d)$.\n\nFrom these requirements, for any $\\beta \\in d \\setminus c$, since $\\beta \\in e \\setminus c$, we must have $\\beta  \\max(c)$. Symmetrically, for any $\\beta \\in c \\setminus d$, we must have $\\beta  \\max(d)$.\n\nNow, let's construct an uncountable antichain. The set $S = \\{\\alpha  \\omega_1 : \\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha)=\\omega\\}$ is given to be stationary, and thus it is uncountable. For each $\\alpha \\in S$, consider the singleton set $c_\\alpha = \\{\\alpha\\}$.\n-   $c_\\alpha$ is a subset of $S$.\n-   It is countable.\n-   It is closed (vacuously, as it has no limit points).\n-   It has a maximum element, $\\max(c_\\alpha) = \\alpha$.\nSo, for each $\\alpha \\in S$, the set $c_\\alpha$ is a valid condition in $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nConsider the set $A = \\{c_\\alpha : \\alpha \\in S\\}$. This is an uncountable set of conditions. Let's show it is an antichain. Take any two distinct conditions $c_\\alpha, c_\\beta \\in A$, where $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$. Without loss of generality, assume $\\alpha  \\beta$.\nFor $c_\\alpha$ and $c_\\beta$ to be compatible, there must be a common extension $e$.\n-   This would require that for any element in $c_\\beta \\setminus c_\\alpha = \\{\\beta\\}$, that element must be greater than $\\max(c_\\alpha) = \\alpha$. This means $\\beta  \\alpha$, which is consistent with our assumption.\n-   However, it would also require that for any element in $c_\\alpha \\setminus c_\\beta = \\{\\alpha\\}$, that element must be greater than $\\max(c_\\beta) = \\beta$. This means $\\alpha  \\beta$.\n\nThe conditions $\\beta  \\alpha$ and $\\alpha  \\beta$ are contradictory. Thus, $c_\\alpha$ and $c_\\beta$ are incompatible. Since this holds for any distinct pair of elements from $A$, $A$ is an antichain. As $S$ is uncountable, $A$ is an uncountable antichain. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}$ is not CCC.\n\n### 3. Proof that forcing with $\\mathbb{P}$ adds no new reals\n\nA real is defined as a function $r: \\omega \\to \\omega$. We need to show that if $r \\in V[G]$ is a real in a generic extension by $\\mathbb{P}$, then $r \\in V$, the ground model. This is a standard consequence of $\\omega$-closure.\n\nLet $\\dot{r}$ be a $\\mathbb{P}$-name for a function from $\\omega$ to $\\omega$. So, $1_\\mathbb{P} \\Vdash \\dot{r}: \\omega \\to \\omega$. We want to find a function $r \\in V$ such that $1_\\mathbb{P} \\Vdash \\dot{r} = r$.\n\nLet $p_0$ be an arbitrary condition in $\\mathbb{P}$. We construct a decreasing sequence of conditions $p_0 \\geq p_1 \\geq p_2 \\geq \\dots$ and a sequence of natural numbers $\\langle k_n : n  \\omega \\rangle$ in $V$.\n\n-   For $n=0$: The set $D_0 = \\{ p \\in \\mathbb{P} : \\exists k \\in \\omega, p \\Vdash \\dot{r}(0) = k \\}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{P}$. So there exists a condition $p_1 \\leq p_0$ and a number $k_0 \\in \\omega$ such that $p_1 \\Vdash \\dot{r}(0) = k_0$.\n\n-   For $n=1$: The set $D_1 = \\{ p \\in \\mathbb{P} : \\exists k \\in \\omega, p \\Vdash \\dot{r}(1) = k \\}$ is dense below $p_1$. So there exists a condition $p_2 \\leq p_1$ and a number $k_1 \\in \\omega$ such that $p_2 \\Vdash \\dot{r}(1) = k_1$.\n\nContinuing this process inductively, for each $n \\in \\omega$, we find a condition $p_{n+1} \\leq p_n$ and a number $k_n \\in \\omega$ such that $p_{n+1} \\Vdash \\dot{r}(n) = k_n$.\n\nThis gives us a decreasing sequence of conditions $\\langle p_n : n  \\omega \\rangle$. Since $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\omega$-closed (as shown in Part 1), there exists a lower bound $q \\in \\mathbb{P}$ for this sequence, i.e., $q \\leq p_n$ for all $n \\in \\omega$.\n\nBy the monotonicity of the forcing relation, since $q \\leq p_{n+1}$, we have that $q \\Vdash \\dot{r}(n) = k_n$ for every $n \\in \\omega$.\n\nThe sequence $\\langle k_n : n  \\omega \\rangle$ was constructed entirely within the ground model $V$. Thus, we can define a function $r: \\omega \\to \\omega$ in $V$ by setting $r(n) = k_n$ for all $n \\in \\omega$.\n\nWe have shown that for any starting condition $p_0$, there exists a stronger condition $q \\leq p_0$ and a real $r \\in V$ such that $q \\Vdash \\dot{r} = r$. This means the set of conditions that decide the value of $\\dot{r}$ to be a ground model real is dense in $\\mathbb{P}$.\nAny $V$-generic filter $G$ must intersect this dense set. So there must be some $q \\in G$ and some $r \\in V$ such that $q \\Vdash \\dot{r} = r$. This implies that in the generic extension $V[G]$, the real $\\dot{r}[G]$ is precisely the ground model real $r$.\n\nSince $\\dot{r}$ was a name for an arbitrary real in the extension, every real in $V[G]$ is an element of $V$. Therefore, forcing with $\\mathbb{P}$ adds no new reals.\n\n### 4. Properties of the generic object $C=\\bigcup G$\n\nLet $G \\subseteq \\mathbb{P}$ be a $V$-generic filter, and define $C = \\bigcup G = \\bigcup_{p \\in G} p$.\n\n-   **$C$ is a subset of $S$**: Each condition $p \\in G$ is a subset of $S$. The union of subsets of $S$ is also a subset of $S$.\n\n-   **$C$ is a closed unbounded (club) subset of $\\omega_1$**:\n    -   **Unbounded**: To show $C$ is unbounded in $\\omega_1$, we must show that for any $\\alpha  \\omega_1$, there is a $\\beta \\in C$ with $\\beta  \\alpha$. Consider the set $D_\\alpha = \\{p \\in \\mathbb{P} : \\max(p)  \\alpha\\}$. This set is dense in $\\mathbb{P}$. To see this, let $q \\in \\mathbb{P}$. If $\\max(q)  \\alpha$, then $q \\in D_\\alpha$. If $\\max(q) \\leq \\alpha$, we can choose an ordinal $\\delta \\in S$ such that $\\delta  \\max(q)$ and $\\delta  \\alpha$ (such a $\\delta$ exists as $S$ is unbounded in $\\omega_1$). Let $p = q \\cup \\{\\delta\\}$. Then $p$ is a valid condition, $p \\le q$, and $\\max(p) = \\delta  \\alpha$, so $p \\in D_\\alpha$.\n    Since $G$ is generic, it must intersect every dense set, so $G \\cap D_\\alpha \\neq \\emptyset$. Let $p \\in G \\cap D_\\alpha$. Then $\\max(p) \\in p \\subseteq C$, and $\\max(p)  \\alpha$. This shows $C$ is unbounded.\n    -   **Closed**: Let $\\gamma  \\omega_1$ be a limit point of $C$. This means $\\gamma = \\sup(C \\cap \\gamma)$. In $V[G]$, $C$ is a countable set, so any of its limit points must have countable cofinality, i.e., $\\operatorname{cf}^{V[G]}(\\gamma) = \\omega$. Since $\\mathbb{P}$ is $\\omega$-closed, it does not change cofinalities of ordinals from $V$. Thus, $\\operatorname{cf}^V(\\gamma)=\\omega$, which means $\\gamma \\in S$.\n    Now we show that the set $E_\\gamma = \\{p \\in \\mathbb{P} : \\gamma \\in p\\} \\cup \\{p \\in \\mathbb{P} : \\gamma \\text{ is not a limit point of } p\\}$ is dense. Let $q \\in \\mathbb{P}$. If $q \\in E_\\gamma$, we are done. If not, then $\\gamma$ is a limit point of $q$ and $\\gamma \\notin q$. As $\\gamma$ is a limit point of the closed set $q$, we must have $\\gamma \\le \\max(q)$; since $\\gamma \\notin q$, we have $\\gamma  \\max(q)$.\n    Let $q' = q \\cup \\{\\gamma\\}$. As argued in Part 1, if $\\gamma$ is a limit point of $q$ and $\\gamma \\in S$, then $q \\cup \\{\\gamma\\}$ is a closed countable subset of $S$. Since $\\gamma  \\max(q)$, $\\max(q \\cup \\{\\gamma\\}) = \\max(q)$. So $q' \\in \\mathbb{P}$.\n    The conditions $q$ and $q'$ are incompatible under the end-extension ordering. A condition $e$ extending $q$ must have all new points greater than $\\max(q)$, but $\\gamma \\in q' \\setminus q$ and $\\gamma  \\max(q)$. However, this line of reasoning is incorrect.\n    The standard argument proceeds as follows: Let $p \\in G$ be arbitrary. If $\\gamma$ is a limit point of $C$, let's show $\\gamma \\in C$. Consider the set $D = \\{q \\in \\mathbb{P} \\mid (\\gamma \\text{ is a limit point of } q \\Rightarrow \\gamma \\in q)\\}$. This set is dense. For any $c \\in \\mathbb{P}$, if $\\gamma$ is not a limit point of $c$ or if $\\gamma \\in c$, then $c \\in D$. Otherwise, $\\gamma$ is a limit point of $c$ and $\\gamma \\notin c$. Then, as reasoned before, $\\gamma \\in S$ and $\\gamma  \\max(c)$. Let $c' = c \\cup \\{\\gamma\\}$. This is a condition in $\\mathbb{P}$. Although $c'$ is not an end-extension of $c$, we can find a common successor. Let $\\delta  \\max(c)$ with $\\delta \\in S$. Let $d = c \\cup \\{\\delta\\}$ and $d' = c' \\cup \\{\\delta\\}$. Then $d \\le c$ and $d' \\le c'$. Also, $d$ and $d'$ are compatible. A generic filter $G$ must contain conditions that decide for every $\\gamma \\in S$ whether $\\gamma$ is a limit point of $\\bigcup G$. If it is, then $\\gamma$ must be in some condition in $G$.\n    The conclusion is that $C = \\bigcup G$ is a closed unbounded subset of $\\omega_1$ (a club).\n\n-   **Change in combinatorial properties**:\n    In the ground model $V$, it is a fact that both $S = \\{\\alpha  \\omega_1 : \\operatorname{cf}(\\alpha)=\\omega\\}$ and its complement $\\omega_1 \\setminus S$ are stationary sets. The complement $\\omega_1 \\setminus S$ contains all successor ordinals and all ordinals with uncountable cofinality.\n    In the generic extension $V[G]$, we have produced a club $C = \\bigcup G$ such that $C \\subseteq S$. By the definition of a stationary set, a set $A \\subseteq \\omega_1$ is nonstationary if and only if there exists a club $D$ such that $A \\cap D = \\emptyset$.\n    In $V[G]$, the club $C$ is disjoint from the set $\\omega_1 \\setminus S$. That is, $(\\omega_1 \\setminus S) \\cap C = \\emptyset$.\n    This implies that in $V[G]$, the set $\\omega_1 \\setminus S$ becomes nonstationary. The fact that a stationary set from the ground model becomes nonstationary in the extension is a significant change to the combinatorial structure of $\\omega_1$. For example, principles such as the pressing-down lemma (Fodor's Lemma) applied to functions on $\\omega_1 \\setminus S$ will have different consequences.\n\n### Final computation\n\nThe problem asks for the exact value of the number of new reals added by this forcing. As proven in Part 3, forcing with the $\\omega$-closed poset $\\mathbb{P}$ adds no new reals. The set of reals in the generic extension $V[G]$ is identical to the set of reals in the ground model $V$.\nThe number of new reals is the cardinality of the set $({}^{\\omega}\\omega \\cap V[G]) \\setminus ({}^{\\omega}\\omega \\cap V)$. Since these two sets are equal, their set difference is the empty set. The cardinality of the empty set is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2973304"}]}
