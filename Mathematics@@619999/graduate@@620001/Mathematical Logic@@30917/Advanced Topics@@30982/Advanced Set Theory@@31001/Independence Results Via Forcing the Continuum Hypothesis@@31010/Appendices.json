This analysis is to be grounded in the foundational metatheorems of first-order logic.\n\nThe core of the issue lies in the relationship between the syntactic and semantic aspects of a formal theory.\n\n*   **Syntactic Notion (Derivability):** A sentence $\\varphi$ is derivable from a theory $T$, denoted $T \\vdash \\varphi$, if there exists a proof of $\\varphi$ from the axioms of $T$ using the rules of inference of first-order logic. A sentence $\\varphi$ is independent of $T$ if neither $T \\vdash \\varphi$ nor $T \\vdash \\neg \\varphi$. This is a purely formal concept dealing with sequences of symbols.\n\n*   **Semantic Notion (Truth in a Model):** A model of a theory $T$ is a mathematical structure $(M, \\in_M)$ where the axioms of $T$ are true under a specific interpretation. We write $M \\models \\psi$ to denote that the sentence $\\psi$ is true in the model $M$.\n\nA direct, \"purely syntactic\" proof of independence would require showing that no possible finite sequence of formulas constitutes a proof of $\\mathrm{CH}$ from $\\mathrm{ZFC}$, and likewise for $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$. For a theory as complex as $\\mathrm{ZFC}$, whose axioms include infinite schemes, the space of possible proofs is infinite and lacks sufficient structure to make such a direct negative demonstration feasible. There is no general algorithm for determining whether a sentence is provable in a theory like $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ (a consequence of the undecidability of first-order logic).\n\nThe bridge between the syntactic and semantic realms is provided by Gödel's Soundness and Completeness theorems for first-order logic.\n\n*   **Soundness Theorem:** If $T \\vdash \\varphi$, then for every model $M$ of $T$, it holds that $M \\models \\varphi$. (Provability implies truth in all models).\n*   **Completeness Theorem:** If for every model $M$ of $T$, it holds that $M \\models \\varphi$, then $T \\vdash \\varphi$. (Truth in all models implies provability).\n\nThese two theorems together establish that $T \\vdash \\varphi$ if and only if $\\varphi$ is true in all models of $T$. We can use this equivalence to rephrase the conditions for independence:\n\n1.  To show $\\mathrm{ZFC} \\nvdash \\neg \\mathrm{CH}$: We need to demonstrate that it is *not* the case that $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ is true in all models of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$. This is equivalent to finding at least one model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ in which $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ is false, i.e., a model $M_1$ such that $M_1 \\models \\mathrm{ZFC}$ and $M_1 \\models \\mathrm{CH}$. This is precisely what Gödel did by constructing the constructible universe, $L$, showing that if $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ is consistent, then $\\mathrm{ZFC} + \\mathrm{CH}$ is consistent. He showed that $L$ is a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC} + \\mathrm{V=L}$, and that $\\mathrm{V=L}$ implies $\\mathrm{GCH}$ (the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis), and thus $\\mathrm{CH}$.\n\n2.  To show $\\mathrm{ZFC} \\nvdash \\mathrm{CH}$: We need to demonstrate that it is *not* the case that $\\mathrm{CH}$ is true in all models of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$. This is equivalent to finding at least one model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ in which $\\mathrm{CH}$ is false, i.e., a model $M_2$ such that $M_2 \\models \\mathrm{ZFC}$ and $M_2 \\models \\neg \\mathrm{CH}$. This is what Paul Cohen did using the method of forcing. He showed that given a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$, one can construct a new model (a \"forcing extension\") in which the axioms of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ still hold but $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ is true.\n\nIn summary, the model-theoretic approach is chosen because the Completeness Theorem transforms an intractable syntactic problem (exploring an infinite space of potential proofs) into a tractable, though highly sophisticated, semantic problem (constructing specific mathematical objects called models).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. By Gödel’s completeness theorem, for any first-order theory $T$ and sentence $\\varphi$, $T \\nvdash \\varphi$ if and only if $T \\cup \\{\\neg \\varphi\\}$ has a model, and $T \\nvdash \\neg \\varphi$ if and only if $T \\cup \\{\\varphi\\}$ has a model. Therefore, to establish independence of $\\mathrm{CH}$ from $\\mathrm{ZFC}$, it is necessary and sufficient (relative to consistency) to exhibit two models of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ that disagree on $\\mathrm{CH}$.**\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the core logic. The equivalence \"$T \\nvdash \\varphi \\iff T \\cup \\{\\neg \\varphi\\}$ has a model\" is a direct and standard consequence of the Completeness Theorem. Applying this to both $\\mathrm{CH}$ and $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ for the theory $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ leads directly to the conclusion that independence is proven by finding two models of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$: one where $\\mathrm{CH}$ is true (a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC} \\cup \\{\\mathrm{CH}\\}$) and one where $\\mathrm{CH}$ is false (a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC} \\cup \\{\\neg \\mathrm{CH}\\}$). The parenthetical \"relative to consistency\" correctly qualifies that these proofs demonstrate the consistency of $\\mathrm{ZFC}+\\mathrm{CH}$ and $\\mathrm{ZFC}+\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ assuming $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ itself is consistent, which is the standard for such results.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The standard semantic route to independence combines Gödel’s construction of the inner model $L$ (in which $\\mathrm{CH}$ holds) with Cohen’s forcing method (which produces a forcing extension in which $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$ holds). Together with soundness and completeness, this shows that syntactic non-derivability is witnessed by the existence of models with opposite truth values, explaining why model-building is central.**\nThis option correctly describes the historical and technical execution of the independence proof for $\\mathrm{CH}$. It accurately names the two key technical achievements: Gödel's constructible universe $L$ for a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}+\\mathrm{CH}$, and Cohen's forcing for a model of $\\mathrm{ZFC}+\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$. It then correctly links these specific model constructions back to the general principle: that via the metatheorems of soundness and completeness, the existence of these models is the very thing that demonstrates syntactic non-derivability. This explains *why* model-building is not just a theoretical possibility but the central and successful methodology in practice.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{CH}$ is not expressible in the first-order language of set theory, so purely syntactic methods in $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ cannot even state $\\mathrm{CH}$, making model-building the only available approach.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The Continuum Hypothesis, which posits $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1$, is fully expressible as a sentence in the first-order language of set theory. The concepts of the set of natural numbers ($\\omega$), the power set operation ($P(x)$), cardinal equivalence (existence of a bijection), and the von Neumann ordinals (including $\\aleph_1$ as the first uncountable ordinal) are all definable within $\\mathrm{ZFC}$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{CH}$ can be, and is, formulated as a first-order sentence. The premise of this option is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Gödel’s first incompleteness theorem states that any sufficiently strong consistent theory is incomplete, which directly implies that $\\mathrm{CH}$ is undecidable in $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ without needing models.**\nThis is a common misinterpretation of the Incompleteness Theorem. The theorem guarantees the *existence* of an undecidable statement for any sufficiently strong, consistent, and effectively axiomatized theory like $\\mathrm{ZFC}$. However, it does not identify any particular, mathematically natural statement (like $\\mathrm{CH}$) as being undecidable. The proof of the theorem constructs a specific, rather artificial sentence (the \"Gödel sentence\") that asserts its own unprovability. To show that a statement like $\\mathrm{CH}$ is independent requires a separate, dedicated proof. The Incompleteness Theorem only tells us that such independent statements exist, not which ones they are.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The compactness theorem ensures that if no finite subset of $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ proves $\\mathrm{CH}$ or $\\neg \\mathrm{CH}$, then $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ does not decide $\\mathrm{CH}$; thus one can establish undecidability by purely syntactic finite-fragment checks without constructing models.**\nThe Compactness Theorem's consequence for proofs is that if $T \\vdash \\varphi$, then some finite subset $T_0 \\subset T$ already yields $T_0 \\vdash \\varphi$. The contrapositive is that if no finite subset proves $\\varphi$, then the full theory $T$ does not prove $\\varphi$. While this is logically sound, it is not a practical method for proving independence. $\\mathrm{ZFC}$ is an infinite axiom scheme, leading to an infinite number of finite subsets to check. Furthermore, proving non-derivability from even a single finite set of axioms is generally intractable. This option misleadingly presents a theoretical consequence as a viable practical alternative to model building, which it is not. It fails to explain why model-building is the *chosen* method.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2974070"}, {"introduction": "Having established why we build models, we now turn to the technical machinery of forcing itself.

Each part of the statement is a standard theorem in forcing theory.\n$1$. The map $j(p) = [p]$ is order-preserving: If $p \\le q$, then for any $r \\le p$, we have $r \\le q$. This means $r$ serves as a common extension for $r$ and $q$, so $r \\not\\perp q$. Since this holds for all $r \\le p$, it follows that $p \\le^* q$, which in turn means $[p] \\le_s [q]$.\n$2$. The map $j$ takes dense subsets of $P$ to dense subsets of $P_s$: Let $D \\subseteq P$ be dense. For any $[q] \\in P_s$, by the density of $D$, there is a $p \\in D$ such that $p \\le q$. As just shown, this implies $p \\le^* q$, so $[p] \\le_s [q]$. Thus, $j(D)$ is dense in $P_s$.\n$3$. Forcing with $P$ is equivalent to forcing with $P_s$: This is a fundamental result. There is a canonical one-to-one correspondence between $P$-generic filters and $P_s$-generic filters that yields the same generic extension.\n$4$.

Atomlessness implies separativity, and conversely, separativity implies atomlessness.**\n\nThis statement is false, as the two properties are independent.\n- **Separativity $\\not\\Rightarrow$ Atomlessness**: Consider a set with two elements $P = \\{a, b\\}$ with the discrete order (only reflexive relations like $a \\le a$ hold). This poset is separative: for $a \\not\\le b$, we can choose $r=a \\le a$, and $a$ is incompatible with $b$ ($a \\perp b$) since no element is less than or equal to both. However, the poset is not atomless: for $p=a$, there are no two incompatible conditions $q,r$ with $q,r \\le a$, as the only such condition is $a$ itself.\n- **Atomlessness $\\not\\Rightarrow$ Separativity**: While more complex to construct, posets that are atomless but not separative do exist. Standard literature in advanced set theory confirms the independence of these two notions.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In forcing arguments concerning the Continuum Hypothesis, one can assume separativity without loss of generality because replacing any $P$ by its Boolean completion always yields an atomless forcing.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect for two distinct reasons.\n$1$. The premise is false. The Boolean completion of a poset is not always atomless. A complete Boolean algebra is atomless if it contains no atoms (a non-zero element $b$ is an atom if any $x \\le b$ is either $0$ or $b$). If a poset $P$ has a condition $p$ that is an \"atom\" in the poset sense (any two conditions stronger than $p$ are compatible), its Boolean completion will not be atomless. For example, the trivial poset $P=\\{p\\}$ has the two-element Boolean algebra as its completion, which is not atomless.\n$2$. The justification is incorrect. The reason we can assume separativity without loss of generality is the equivalence of forcing with $P$ and its separative quotient $P_s$, as detailed correctly in option C. The Boolean completion is a different construction.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. For any poset $P$, $p \\le^{*} q$ holds if and only if there does not exist $r \\le p$ with $r \\perp q$.**\n\nThe given definition of the separative modification order is: $p \\le^{*} q$ if and only if for all $r \\le p$, one has $r \\not\\perp q$. Let the set of conditions stronger than or equal to $p$ be $S_p = \\{s \\in P \\mid s \\le p\\}$. Let the property $\\phi(s)$ be $s \\not\\perp q$. The definition is $\\forall s \\in S_p, \\phi(s)$.

The problem states $\\kappa \\geq \\aleph_1$. Therefore, in $\\mathbf{V}$, we have $(\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\max(\\kappa, \\aleph_1) = \\kappa$.\n\n**Part 1: The Finite-Support Product $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$**\n\n1.  **Cardinality of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$:** A condition in $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ is a function $p$ defined on a finite subset of $\\kappa$ (its support), where for each $\\xi$ in the support, $p(\\xi)$ is a non-trivial condition in $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)_{\\xi}$. The total set of conditions can be expressed as a union over all possible finite supports:\n    $$ \\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}} = \\bigcup_{S \\in [\\kappa]^{<\\omega}} \\prod_{\\xi \\in S} \\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)_{\\xi} $$\n    The number of finite subsets of $\\kappa$ is $|[\\kappa]^{<\\omega}| = \\kappa$. For any finite support $S$ with $|S|=n$, the number of conditions on that support is $|\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)|^{n} = \\aleph_{0}^{n} = \\aleph_{0}$.\n    Thus, the total number of conditions is $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}| = |[\\kappa]^{<\\omega}| \\cdot \\aleph_{0} = \\kappa \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\kappa$.\n\n2.  **Chain Condition of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$:** It is a standard theorem that a finite-support product of ccc posets is ccc, provided that the ground model satisfies certain cardinal arithmetic properties. Specifically, if $\\mathbb{P}_\\xi$ is ccc for all $\\xi < \\kappa$, then $\\prod_{\\xi<\\kappa}^{\\mathrm{FS}}\\mathbb{P}_\\xi$ is ccc if $(\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\kappa$. As established in the preliminaries, GCH and $\\kappa \\geq \\aleph_1$ ensure that $(\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\kappa$. Since each factor $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)_{\\xi}$ is ccc, $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ is ccc.\n\n3.  **Value of $2^{\\omega}$ in $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]$:**\n    -   **Upper Bound:** Forcing with a ccc poset preserves cardinals. Any new subset of $\\omega$ in the extension $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]$ corresponds to a \"name\" in $\\mathbf{V}$. The number of such subsets is bounded by the number of nice names for subsets of $\\omega$. This number is in turn bounded by $(|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}|^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}}$.\n        $$ (2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]} \\leq (|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}|^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = (\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\kappa $$\n    -   **Lower Bound:** The forcing $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$ adds, for each $\\xi < \\kappa$, a generic function $g_{\\xi}: \\omega \\to 2$. These functions are distinct for distinct $\\xi$. This is because for any $\\xi \\neq \\zeta$, the set of conditions that force $g_{\\xi}(n) \\neq g_{\\zeta}(n)$ for some $n$ is dense. Consequently, in the generic extension $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]$, there exists an injection from $\\kappa$ into the set of real numbers $2^{\\omega}$. This implies:\n        $$ \\kappa \\leq (2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]} $$\n    -   **Conclusion for $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{prod}}$:** Combining the upper and lower bounds, by the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein theorem, we conclude that $(2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]} = \\kappa$.\n\n**Part 2: The Finite-Support Iteration $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$**\n\n1.  **Cardinality of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$:** The forcing $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$ is the finite-support iteration $\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}$ of length $\\kappa$, where at each stage $\\alpha < \\kappa$, the iterand $\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}$ is a name for $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)$. A standard result on the cardinality of finite-support iterations states that if $|\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}|$ is forced to be at most $\\lambda$ for all $\\alpha < \\kappa$, then $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}| \\leq (\\kappa \\cdot \\lambda)^{<\\aleph_0}$. In our case, $1 \\Vdash_{\\alpha} |\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}| = \\aleph_{0}$, so we can take $\\lambda = \\aleph_{0}$. Thus, $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}| \\leq (\\kappa \\cdot \\aleph_0)^{<\\aleph_0} = \\kappa^{<\\aleph_0} = \\kappa$. The inequality $\\kappa \\leq |\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}|$ is clear, as for each $\\alpha < \\kappa$ we can construct distinct conditions supported only at $\\{\\alpha\\}$. Therefore, $|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}| = \\kappa$.\n\n2.  **Chain Condition of $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$:** A fundamental theorem of forcing states that any finite-support iteration of ccc posets is ccc. That is, if for every $\\alpha < \\kappa$, it is forced that $\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}$ is ccc (i.e., $1_{\\alpha} \\Vdash_{\\mathbb{P}_{\\alpha}} \"\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha} \\text{ is ccc}\"$), then the iteration $\\mathbb{P}_{\\kappa}$ is ccc. In our case, each $\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}$ is a name for $\\mathrm{Add}(\\omega,1)$, which is ccc. This property is absolute, so the condition holds. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$ is ccc.\n\n3.  **Value of $2^{\\omega}$ in $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]$:** The argument is identical to the one for the product forcing.\n    -   **Upper Bound:** Since $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$ is a ccc poset of size $\\kappa$, the number of new reals added is bounded by $(|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}|^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}}$.\n        $$ (2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]} \\leq (|\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}|^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = (\\kappa^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathbf{V}} = \\kappa $$\n    -   **Lower Bound:** The iteration adds a new Cohen real at each stage $\\alpha < \\kappa$. Let $g_{\\alpha}$ be the Cohen real added by the forcing $\\dot{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\alpha}$. These reals $\\{g_{\\alpha} \\mid \\alpha < \\kappa\\}$ form a set of size $\\kappa$ in the final model $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]$. This provides an injection from $\\kappa$ to $2^{\\omega}$.\n        $$ \\kappa \\leq (2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]} $$\n    -   **Conclusion for $\\mathbb{P}_{\\mathrm{iter}}$:** Combining the bounds, we conclude that $(2^{\\omega})^{\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]} = \\kappa$.\n\n**Final Summary**\nBoth the finite-support product and the finite-support iteration of $\\kappa$ copies of Cohen forcing result in generic extensions where the value of the continuum is $\\kappa$. For both forcing notions, the key properties are that they have cardinality $\\kappa$, they satisfy the countable chain condition (ccc), and they add $\\kappa$ new Cohen reals. These properties, combined with the GCH in the ground model, uniquely determine the value of $2^{\\omega}$ in the extensions.\n\nThe value of $2^{\\omega}$ in $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{prod}}]$ is $a=\\kappa$.\nThe value of $2^{\\omega}$ in $\\mathbf{V}[G_{\\mathrm{iter}}]$ is $b=\\kappa$.\nThe final answer is presented as the row vector $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\kappa & \\kappa\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2974076"}]}
