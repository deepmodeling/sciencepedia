All provided definitions and contextual descriptions are standard, factually correct, and self-consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and scientifically grounded within its domain.\n\nAn analysis of each option follows.\n\n**A. Under full second-order semantics, the second-order Peano axioms are categorical: any model of these axioms is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{N},\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}))$. Under Henkin semantics, the same axioms are not categorical because second-order quantifiers range only over a designated $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}))$.**\n\nThis statement is correct. A major result in mathematical logic, due to Dedekind, shows that the second-order Peano axioms ($\\mathsf{PA}_2$, also denoted $\\mathsf{Z}_2$), when interpreted using full second-order semantics, are categorical. This means that any two models are isomorphic, and specifically, they are all isomorphic to the intended or standard model of arithmetic, whose first-order part is the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ and whose second-order part is the full power set $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$.\n\nUnder Henkin semantics, the second-order quantifiers $\\forall X$ and $\\exists X$ range not over the entirety of $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$, but over a specified collection of sets $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$. This allows for the existence of multiple, non-isomorphic models that satisfy the axioms of $\\mathsf{PA}_2$. For instance, let $\\text{ARITH}$ be the countable collection of all arithmetical subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$. The structure $(\\mathbb{N}, \\text{ARITH})$ is a model of the subsystem $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$, which includes $\\mathsf{PA}_2$. Similarly, let $\\text{REC}$ be the countable collection of all recursive (computable) subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$. The structure $(\\mathbb{N}, \\text{REC})$ is a model of the base system $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$, which also includes the relevant axioms. Since $\\text{REC} \\subsetneq \\text{ARITH} \\subsetneq \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$, we have at least three non-isomorphic models: $(\\mathbb{N}, \\text{REC})$, $(\\mathbb{N}, \\text{ARITH})$, and $(\\mathbb{N}, \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}))$. Thus, categoricity is lost under Henkin semantics. The reason provided—the restricted range of quantification—is precisely the cause of this phenomenon.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Comprehension axioms, such as $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$, compensate for the unavailability of full semantics by axiomatizing the existence of sets $X = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\varphi(n)\\}$ for $\\varphi(n)$ in a specified syntactic class, thereby guaranteeing within proofs the availability of those sets which full semantics would treat as already present.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It accurately describes the role of comprehension axioms in proof theory and reverse mathematics. In a system with full semantics, for any property $\\varphi(n)$ whatsoever (definable in the metalanguage), the set $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} | \\varphi(n)\\}$ is an element of $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$ and is thus available for quantification. In a formal proof system based on Henkin semantics, we do not have this semantic guarantee. Instead, we must introduce axioms that explicitly postulate the existence of sets.\n\nComprehension axiom schemes provide this function. They assert $\\exists X \\forall n (n \\in X \\leftrightarrow \\varphi(n))$ for all formulas $\\varphi$ belonging to a particular syntactic class. For example, $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ provides this for $\\Delta^0_1$ formulas, and $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ provides it for all arithmetical ($\\Pi^0_k$ or $\\Sigma^0_k$) formulas. By adding these axioms, we ensure that sets definable in specific ways are guaranteed to exist within any model and can be used in formal deductions. This is a way of \"compensating\" for the lack of the full power set by axiomatically providing access to a rich-enough class of definable sets to carry out mathematical arguments.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. If one adds the Full Comprehension scheme (for all $\\mathcal{L}_2$-formulas) to Henkin semantics, then in every model $(\\mathbb{N},\\mathcal{S})$ one has $\\mathcal{S} = \\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$, so full second-order semantics is recovered proof-theoretically.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The Full Comprehension scheme ($Z_2$), within the framework of Henkin semantics, asserts that for any formula $\\varphi$ of the language $\\mathcal{L}_2$ (possibly with set parameters from $\\mathcal{S}$), the set $\\{ n \\in \\mathbb{N} | (\\mathbb{N}, \\mathcal{S}) \\models \\varphi(n) \\}$ is an element of $\\mathcal{S}$. This means that $\\mathcal{S}$ is closed under definability over the structure $(\\mathbb{N}, \\mathcal{S})$.\n\nHowever, this does not force $\\mathcal{S}$ to be the full power set $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$. The theory of second-order arithmetic with the full comprehension scheme, when viewed under Henkin semantics, is a two-sorted first-order theory. As such, by the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem, it must have a countable model. If $(\\mathbb{N}, \\mathcal{S})$ is a countable model (meaning $\\mathcal{S}$ is a countable set), then $\\mathcal{S}$ cannot be equal to $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$, which is famously uncountable. For example, the collection of all sets constructible from the natural numbers, $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}) \\cap L$, forms a model of $\\mathsf{Z}_2$ yet can be a proper subset of $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$ if $V \\neq L$. The statement makes a fundamental error by conflating closure under internal definability with being exhaustive.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Under Henkin semantics, second-order logic reduces to a many-sorted first-order logic, so completeness and compactness theorems hold; this permits Reverse Mathematics to replace semantic quantification over $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$ with axiomatic comprehension calibrated to the needs of proofs.**\n\nThis statement is correct. This is a foundational insight of Leon Henkin. By treating the second-order variables as variables of a separate sort, with their own quantifiers and a domain $\\mathcal{S}$, the language $\\mathcal{L}_2$ and its deductive system behave exactly like a two-sorted first-order logic. A crucial consequence is that the metalogical properties of first-order logic, namely Gödel's Completeness Theorem and the Compactness Theorem, apply to this system. Completeness guarantees that any sentence that is true in all Henkin models is provable from the axioms.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to full second-order semantics, for which the logic is incomplete (no sound, effective proof system can prove all validities) and not compact. The availability of a complete proof calculus is what makes the methodology of Reverse Mathematics viable. It allows for a meaningful investigation of which axioms are *provably* necessary and sufficient to demonstrate a given mathematical theorem. The focus shifts from the unwieldy semantic object $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$ to a tractable, axiomatic, proof-theoretic analysis.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. In $\\omega$-models $(\\mathbb{N},\\mathcal{S})$ used in Reverse Mathematics, the set component $\\mathcal{S}$ is a Turing ideal (closed under Turing reducibility and join), and strengthening comprehension schemes (e.g., from $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ to $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$) corresponds to imposing stronger closure properties on $\\mathcal{S}$ (such as closure under arithmetical definability relative to parameters), thereby simulating access to more of $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$ while retaining Henkin semantics.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It points to a deep structural property of the models studied in Reverse Mathematics. An $\\omega$-model is a model of the form $(\\mathbb{N}, \\mathcal{S})$ where the first-order part is the standard set of natural numbers. These are the most important models for understanding \"ordinary mathematics\".\n\nA fundamental result is that any $\\omega$-model of the base system $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ must have a set component $\\mathcal{S}$ that is a Turing ideal. This means that if a set $Y$ is Turing reducible to a set $X \\in \\mathcal{S}$ (i.e., $Y \\le_T X$), then $Y$ must also be in $\\mathcal{S}$, and if $X, Y \\in \\mathcal{S}$, their Turing join $X \\oplus Y$ must also be in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nStrengthening the system from $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ to a stronger one like $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ indeed corresponds to requiring the collection $\\mathcal{S}$ to satisfy stronger closure properties. The minimal $\\omega$-model of $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ consists of the recursive sets, $\\text{REC}$. The axiom of arithmetical comprehension in $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ forces any $\\omega$-model $\\mathcal{S}$ to be closed under the Turing jump operation and, more generally, under arithmetical definability. The minimal $\\omega$-model of $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is the set of all arithmetical sets, $\\text{ARITH}$. This progressive strengthening of axioms allows for proofs of more theorems by \"simulating access to more of $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})$\" through these stronger closure properties, all within the framework of Henkin semantics.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDE}$$", "id": "2981978"}, {"introduction": "Once we adopt an axiomatic system for second-order arithmetic, a crucial question arises: what new number-theoretic facts can we prove?

A sufficient model-theoretic condition guaranteeing that $T$ is conservative over $S$ for first-order sentences is: for every model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $S$, there exists a collection $\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathcal{P}(M)$ such that the expanded two-sorted structure $(\\mathcal{M},\\mathcal{X})$ is a model of $T$; equivalently, every $S$-model admits a $T$-expansion without changing its first-order part.**\n\nThis describes a standard and powerful model-theoretic method for proving conservativity. Let's verify its sufficiency.\nAssume the condition holds: every model of $S$ can be expanded to a model of $T$. We want to show that for any arithmetical sentence $\\varphi$, if $T \\vdash \\varphi$, then $S \\vdash \\varphi$. We prove the contrapositive: if $S \\not\\vdash \\varphi$, then $T \\not\\vdash \\varphi$.\n\n1.  Suppose $S \\not\\vdash \\varphi$ for some arithmetical sentence $\\varphi$.\n2.  By the Completeness Theorem for first-order logic, if $S$ does not prove $\\varphi$, there must exist a model of $S \\cup \\{\\neg\\varphi\\}$. Let this model be $\\mathcal{M}$. So, $\\mathcal{M} \\models S$ and $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\neg\\varphi$.\n3.  By the condition stated in the option, since $\\mathcal{M}$ is a model of $S$, there exists a collection of sets $\\mathcal{X}$ over the domain of $\\mathcal{M}$ such that the two-sorted structure $(\\mathcal{M}, \\mathcal{X})$ is a model of $T$. So, $(\\mathcal{M}, \\mathcal{X}) \\models T$.\n4.  The sentence $\\varphi$ is arithmetical. This means its truth value in the two-sorted structure $(\\mathcal{M}, \\mathcal{X})$ depends only on the first-order part, $\\mathcal{M}$. Since we know $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\neg\\varphi$, it follows that $(\\mathcal{M}, \\mathcal{X}) \\models \\neg\\varphi$.\n5.  We have found a model of $T$, namely $(\\mathcal{M}, \\mathcal{X})$, in which $\\varphi$ is false. By the Soundness Theorem, this implies that $T$ cannot prove $\\varphi$. That is, $T \\not\\vdash \\varphi$.\nThus, we have shown that $S \\not\\vdash \\varphi$ implies $T \\not\\vdash \\varphi$. This is equivalent to showing $T \\vdash \\varphi$ implies $S \\vdash \\varphi$. The condition is indeed sufficient. The rephrasing \"every $S$-model admits a $T$-expansion\" is a standard and accurate way to express this condition.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. The induction scheme in second-order arithmetic does not affect conservativity over first-order theories; only the comprehension axioms influence whether $T$ is conservative over $S$ for first-order sentences.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The strength of the induction scheme is a critical factor in determining the first-order (arithmetical) consequences of a theory of second-order arithmetic.\nFor instance, the theory $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ consists of a base theory (basic axioms for arithmetic) plus $\\Delta^0_1$ comprehension and $\\Sigma^0_1$ induction ($\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_1$). $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ is conservative over the first-order theory $\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_1$ for arithmetical sentences.\nThe theory $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ has a stronger comprehension scheme (Arithmetical Comprehension) but also implies a stronger induction scheme (full induction for all arithmetical formulas). $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is conservative over Peano Arithmetic ($\\mathsf{PA}$), which includes the full first-order induction scheme.\nHowever, $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is *not* conservative over $\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_1$. $\\mathsf{PA}$ proves arithmetical sentences that $\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_1$ does not (e.g., the consistency of $\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_1$, or the totality of certain fast-growing functions). Since $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is as strong as $\\mathsf{PA}$ for arithmetical sentences, $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ also proves these sentences.\nThe difference in strength between $\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_1$ and $\\mathsf{PA}$ lies entirely in the induction scheme. This demonstrates that strengthening induction (from $\\Sigma^0_1$ to full arithmetical) can destroy conservativity over a weaker base theory. Thus, both comprehension and induction are crucial.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Strengthening the induction scheme to allow induction on formulas of higher arithmetical complexity (for example, from $\\Sigma^0_1$-induction up to full arithmetical induction, or beyond) can destroy conservativity over weaker first-order bases, by enabling $T$ to prove new purely number-theoretic sentences not provable in $S$.**\n\nThis statement is the correct refutation of statement C. As explained in the analysis of C, the hierarchy of first-order arithmetic theories $S_n = \\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_n$ (Peano arithmetic with induction restricted to $\\Sigma^0_n$ formulas) is known to be a strict hierarchy in terms of proof-theoretic strength. For each $n$, $\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_{n+1}$ proves the consistency of $\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_n$ ($\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_n)$), which is an arithmetical ($\\Pi^0_1$) sentence. By Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem, $\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_n$ cannot prove $\\mathrm{Con}(\\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_n)$ (assuming it is consistent).\nTherefore, a second-order theory $T$ whose first-order consequences match $\\mathsf{PA}$ (which is equivalent to $\\bigcup_n \\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_n$) will not be conservative over a weaker first-order base $S = \\mathsf{I}\\Sigma^0_1$. The ability of $T$ to prove these new arithmetical sentences comes directly from its having a stronger induction principle than $S$. Thus, strengthening induction can destroy conservativity.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. The Arithmetical Comprehension Axiom $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is conservative over Peano Arithmetic $\\mathsf{PA}$ for arithmetical sentences; crucially, $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ does not strengthen the first-order induction scheme beyond that of $\\mathsf{PA}$, so the added set existence does not yield new purely first-order consequences.**\n\nThis statement makes two claims, both of which are standard results in the field.\n1.  **Conservativity**: It is a fundamental theorem of proof theory that $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is conservative over $\\mathsf{PA}$ for arithmetical sentences. The proof uses the model-theoretic argument described in option B: any model $\\mathcal{M}$ of $\\mathsf{PA}$ can be expanded to a model of $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ by taking the second-order part to be the collection of all arithmetically definable subsets of the domain of $\\mathcal{M}$, i.e., sets of the form $\\{n \\in M \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi(n)\\}$ for any arithmetical formula $\\varphi$.\n2.  **Reason**: The explanation for this conservativity is also correct. The theory $\\mathsf{PA}$ includes an induction axiom for every formula in the first-order language of arithmetic. The theory $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is strong enough to prove induction for every arithmetical formula in the second-order language $\\mathcal{L}_2$. This means that with respect to arithmetical properties, the induction available in $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is precisely as strong as the induction in $\\mathsf{PA}$. The Arithmetical Comprehension axiom guarantees the existence of sets that are definable by arithmetical formulas. From the perspective of $\\mathsf{PA}$, these are not \"new\" entities in a deep sense; they are just the collections that $\\mathsf{PA}$ could already describe. Giving them names (as sets) does not add any new arithmetical proof power.

In the direction Heine–Borel $\\Rightarrow \\mathsf{WKL}_0$, it suffices to consider the open cover $\\{[0,1] \\setminus I_s : s \\in T\\}$; a finite subcover of complements directly yields an infinite path through $T$.", "solution": "The question asks for the selection of all statements that correctly describe the proof, within the base system $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$, of the equivalence between the Heine-Borel theorem for the unit interval $[0,1]$ and Weak König's Lemma ($\\mathsf{WKL}_0$).\n\nThe problem statement is validated as follows:\n- **Givens**: The base system is $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$. Real numbers are coded by fast Cauchy sequences of rationals. Open sets are coded by sequences of rational open intervals. $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$ asserts that every infinite subtree of $2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ has an infinite path. The Heine-Borel theorem for $[0,1]$ asserts that every coded open cover of $[0,1]$ has a finite subcover. Dyadic intervals $I_s = [a_s, b_s)$ for $s \\in 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ are defined by recursively halving $[0,1)$.\n- **Validation**: The problem is set within the established field of reverse mathematics. All definitions and axioms ($\\mathsf{RCA}_0$, $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$, Heine-Borel theorem, coding schemes) are standard and formally defined in mathematical logic. The question is objective, well-posed, and scientifically sound. It is a non-trivial question about the structure of a core proof in reverse mathematics. The problem statement is valid.\n\nWe will now analyze each option. The equivalence to be proven is $\\mathsf{RCA}_0 \\vdash (\\mathsf{WKL}_0 \\leftrightarrow \\text{Heine-Borel})$.\n\n### Option A: Evaluation\n\nThis option outlines the proof for the direction $\\mathsf{WKL}_0 \\Rightarrow \\text{Heine-Borel}$. The proof is by contradiction.\n1.  **Assumption**: Assume an open cover $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of $[0,1]$ exists with no finite subcover.\n2.  **Tree Construction**: A binary tree $T \\subseteq 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is defined by $s \\in T \\iff \\overline{I_s}$ is not covered by $\\{U_0, \\ldots, U_{|s|-1}\\}$. Here, $\\overline{I_s}$ denotes the closure of the half-open interval $I_s$. For this tree to exist as an object in $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$, the condition for membership must be decidable (recursive, or $\\Delta^0_1$). Given a finite string $s$ and a finite collection of coded open sets $\\{U_0, \\ldots, U_{|s|-1}\\}$, determining if their union covers the rational interval $\\overline{I_s}$ is a computable procedure. Thus, the tree $T$ is recursive and its existence is provable in $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$.\n3.  **$T$ is infinite**: Suppose $T$ is finite. Then there is a maximum length $N$ for nodes in $T$. This implies that for any string $s$ of length $N+1$, $s \\notin T$. By definition of $T$, for any such $s$, the interval $\\overline{I_s}$ is covered by the finite collection $\\{U_0, \\ldots, U_N\\}$. The set of intervals $\\{\\overline{I_s} : |s|=N+1\\}$ constitutes a finite partition of $[0,1]$. Since each $\\overline{I_s}$ is covered by $\\{U_0, \\ldots, U_N\\}$, their union, which is $[0,1]$, is also covered by $\\{U_0, \\ldots, U_N\\}$. This forms a finite subcover of $\\{U_n\\}$, contradicting our initial assumption. Therefore, $T$ must be infinite.\n4.  **Application of $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$**: Since $T$ is an infinite binary tree, by $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$, there exists an infinite path $p$ through $T$.\n5.  **Contradiction**: The path $p$ defines a unique real number $x = \\bigcap_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\overline{I_{p \\upharpoonright k}}$. Since $\\{U_n\\}$ is a cover of $[0,1]$, $x$ must lie in some $U_j$. As $U_j$ is open, there is an open neighborhood of $x$ contained in $U_j$. For a sufficiently large integer $K$, the interval $\\overline{I_{p \\upharpoonright K}}$ will be contained within this neighborhood, and thus $\\overline{I_{p \\upharpoonright K}} \\subseteq U_j$. Let $s = p \\upharpoonright k$ for any $k  \\max(K, j)$. Since $p$ is a path in $T$, we have $s \\in T$. However, $\\overline{I_s} \\subseteq \\overline{I_{p \\upharpoonright K}} \\subseteq U_j$. Since $j  k$, the set $\\{U_0, \\ldots, U_{k-1}\\}$ contains $U_j$, so $\\overline{I_s}$ is covered by $\\{U_0, \\ldots, U_{k-1}\\}$. This implies $s \\notin T$, which contradicts $s \\in T$.\n\nThe argument presented in option A is a correct and standard outline of the proof.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Option B: Evaluation\n\nThis statement claims that full König's Lemma ($\\mathsf{KL}_0$, for all finitely branching trees) is required instead of $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$. This is incorrect. The equivalence of the Heine-Borel theorem for $[0,1]$ and $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$ is a central result in reverse mathematics. The proof, as sketched in option A, uses a binary tree, for which $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$ is the appropriate principle. The full König's Lemma ($\\mathsf{KL}_0$) is a strictly stronger principle, known to be equivalent over $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ to the axiom system $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$, which proves the existence of arithmetic sets. The Heine-Borel theorem is not that strong. The justification provided, \"because binary trees need not admit paths without induction stronger than that available in $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$,\" is confused. $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$ is precisely the axiom asserting that such paths exist, added to $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Option C: Evaluation\n\nThis option outlines the proof for the direction Heine-Borel $\\Rightarrow \\mathsf{WKL}_0$.\n1.  **Assumption**: Assume $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$ is false. This means there exists an infinite binary tree $T \\subseteq 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ with no infinite path.\n2.  **Cover Construction**: For each string $s \\notin T$, we associate an open set. A standard way is to choose a rational open interval $J_s$ that contains the closed dyadic interval $\\overline{I_s}$. The collection $\\mathcal{C} = \\{J_s : s \\notin T\\}$ forms an open cover of $[0,1]$. To see this, consider any $x \\in [0,1]$. Its binary expansion determines a sequence of bits, $p$. Since $T$ has no infinite path, $p$ cannot be a path in $T$. This means there is some initial segment $s = p \\upharpoonright k$ such that $s \\notin T$. The point $x$ belongs to $\\overline{I_s}$, and thus to $J_s$. So $\\mathcal{C}$ covers $[0,1]$. $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ can formalize the construction of this sequence of open sets from the given tree $T$.\n3.  **Application of Heine-Borel**: By the Heine-Borel theorem, there is a finite subcover $\\{J_{s_i} : i  m\\}$ where each $s_i \\notin T$.\n4.  **Contradiction**: Let $N = \\max \\{ |s_i| : i  m \\}$. Since $T$ is an infinite tree, it must contain at least one node of every length, so there exists some $t \\in T$ with $|t|=N$. The interval $\\overline{I_t}$ is a subset of $[0,1]$ and must be covered by the finite subcover. A careful analysis shows that for $\\overline{I_t}$ to be covered by the $\\{J_{s_i}\\}$, $t$ must have one of the $s_i$ as a prefix (assuming the $\\{s_i\\}$ are pruned to an antichain, a property that can be arranged without loss of generality). If $t$ has prefix $s_i$, and $t \\in T$, then $s_i$ must also be in $T$. But this contradicts the fact that $s_i$ was chosen from the set of strings not in $T$.\n    The option's slightly different but equivalent reasoning is also valid: let $t$ be any string of length $N$. The interval $\\overline{I_t}$ must be covered, which implies $t$ must have some $s_i$ (where $s_i \\notin T$) as a prefix. This implies that $t$ itself cannot be in $T$. Therefore, no string of length $N$ is in $T$. This contradicts the assumption that $T$ is infinite.\nThe argument is a correct summary of the proof.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Option D: Evaluation\n\nThis option describes several technical details required to formalize the proofs in $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$.\n1.  **Dyadic coding**: The use of half-open intervals $I_s = [a_s, b_s)$ ensures that each real number $x \\in [0,1)$ has a unique binary expansion (the one not ending in repeated $1$s) corresponding to a unique sequence of nested intervals $I_s$. This is a standard and effective way to avoid ambiguities at dyadic rational points, simplifying the translation between paths in $2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and points in $[0,1]$. This is correct.\n2.  **Coding in $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$**: The base system $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ is designed to be strong enough to formalize the coding of mathematical objects like sequences, rational numbers, real numbers (as Cauchy sequences), and open sets (as sequences of rational intervals), and to prove their basic properties. This is correct.\n3.  **Tree decidability**: As noted in the analysis of option A, the proof $\\mathsf{WKL}_0 \\Rightarrow \\text{H-B}$ requires constructing a tree $T$. For its existence to be provable in $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$, its membership predicate must be $\\Delta^0_1$ (recursive). The proposed definition $s \\in T \\iff \\overline{I_s}$ is not covered by $\\{U_0, \\ldots, U_{|s|-1}\\}$ is indeed a computable predicate. This is a crucial point for the formalization. This is correct.\n4.  **Path to real number**: Given an infinite path $p$ (which is a set whose existence is asserted by $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$), one can construct a sequence of rational numbers, e.g., the midpoints of the intervals $I_{p\\upharpoonright k}$. The length of $I_{p\\upharpoonright k}$ is $2^{-k}$, so this sequence is a fast Cauchy sequence. In $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$, any fast Cauchy sequence of rationals defines a real number. This is correct.\n\nAll claims in this option are accurate and represent key steps in the rigorous formalization of the equivalence within $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n### Option E: Evaluation\n\nThis option incorrectly asserts that the Arithmetical Comprehension Axiom ($\\mathsf{ACA}_0$) is necessary to prove $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$ from the Heine-Borel theorem. As established by the argument in option C, the proof can be carried out using only the resources of $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$ plus the Heine-Borel principle. $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ is a significantly stronger axiom system than $\\mathsf{WKL}_0 = \\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \\mathsf{WKL}$. If $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$ were necessary, the two principles (Heine-Borel and $\\mathsf{WKL}_0$) would not be equivalent over $\\mathsf{RCA}_0$. The mention of a \"maximal antichain\" is a distractor; while such objects are used in other proofs in reverse mathematics (and constructing them can indeed require $\\mathsf{ACA}_0$), it is not a necessary component of this specific proof.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Option F: Evaluation\n\nThis option proposes an alternative proof for Heine-Borel $\\Rightarrow \\mathsf{WKL}_0$. It suggests using the cover $\\{[0,1] \\setminus I_s : s \\in T\\}$.\nFirst, the set $[0,1] \\setminus I_s = [0,1] \\setminus [a_s, b_s)$ is $[0, a_s) \\cup [b_s, 1]$, which is not an open set in the standard topology of $[0,1]$.\nEven if we correct this to use closed intervals, viz., the cover $\\mathcal{C} = \\{[0,1] \\setminus \\overline{I_s} : s \\in T\\}$, the argument fails. A finite subcover $\\{[0,1] \\setminus \\overline{I_{s_i}} : i  m\\}$ implies that $[0,1] = \\bigcup_{im} ([0,1] \\setminus \\overline{I_{s_i}})$, which is equivalent to $\\bigcap_{im} \\overline{I_{s_i}} = \\emptyset$. However, any finite intersection of closed dyadic intervals is non-empty. For instance, $\\overline{I_{(0)}} \\cap \\overline{I_{(1)}} = [0, 1/2] \\cap [1/2, 1] = \\{1/2\\} \\neq \\emptyset$. So the intersection can never be empty. The proposed construction is fundamentally flawed and does not work.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Option A: Correct.\n- Option B: Incorrect.\n- Option C: Correct.\n- Option D: Correct.\n- Option E: Incorrect.\n- Option F: Incorrect.\n\nThe statements that correctly describe the blueprint for the proof are A, C, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2981962"}]}
