I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate the options.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe goal is to show that for any oracle $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$, the sets $J_{\\Phi}(A)$ and $J_{\\Psi}(A)$ are Turing equivalent ($J_{\\Phi}(A) \\equiv_T J_{\\Psi}(A)$). This requires showing that $J_{\\Phi}(A) \\leq_T J_{\\Psi}(A)$ and $J_{\\Psi}(A) \\leq_T J_{\\Phi}(A)$. We will prove a stronger result: that they are many-one equivalent ($J_{\\Phi}(A) \\equiv_m J_{\\Psi}(A)$), which implies Turing equivalence.\n\nLet's show $J_{\\Psi}(A) \\leq_m J_{\\Phi}(A)$. By definition, this requires finding a total computable function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ such that for any $e \\in \\mathbb{N}$,\n$$\ne \\in J_{\\Psi}(A) \\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\; f(e) \\in J_{\\Phi}(A).\n$$\nThis is equivalent to showing:\n$$\n\\Psi_e^A(e) \\downarrow \\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\; \\Phi_{f(e)}^A(f(e)) \\downarrow.\n$$\nThe proof relies on the properties of acceptable enumerations $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$, specifically the s-m-n theorem (also called the parameterization theorem).\n\n1.  For any fixed index $e \\in \\mathbb{N}$, consider the partial function $G_e(x)$ which, for any input $x$, computes $\\Psi_e^A(e)$. The computation of $G_e(x)$ is as follows: take an input $x$, ignore it, and run the computation of the $\\Psi$-machine with index $e$ on input $e$, using the oracle $A$. This process can be implemented by an oracle Turing machine. Thus, for each $e$, $G_e(x)$ is a partial $A$-recursive function.\n\n2.  More generally, consider the function of two variables $H(e, x) = \\Psi_e^A(e)$. This function is partial $A$-recursive. An oracle machine with oracle $A$ can compute $H(e,x)$ by taking the pair $(e,x)$ as input, ignoring $x$, and simulating the computation $\\Psi_e^A(e)$.\n\n3.  Since $\\Phi$ is an acceptable enumeration of all partial $A$-recursive functionals, the function $H(e,x)$ must correspond to some functional in the $\\Phi$ enumeration. That is, there exists a fixed index $v \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that for all $e, x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and any oracle $A$:\n    $$\n    \\Phi_v^A(e, x) \\simeq H(e, x) \\simeq \\Psi_e^A(e).\n    $$\n    The notation $\\simeq$ means that the computations on both sides either both diverge, or both halt and yield the same result.\n\n4.  The parameterization (s-m-n) theorem is a fundamental property of all acceptable enumerations. For the enumeration $\\Phi$, it guarantees the existence of a total computable function, usually denoted $s_1^1$, such that for any index $v$ and any $e$:\n    $$\n    \\Phi_{s_1^1(v, e)}^A(x) \\simeq \\Phi_v^A(e, x).\n    $$\n\n5.  Let us define the function $f(e) = s_1^1(v, e)$. Since $v$ is a fixed constant and $s_1^1$ is a total computable function, $f$ is also a total computable function. This function $f$ does not depend on the oracle $A$.\n\n6.  Combining the steps, we have for any $e, x \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n    $$\n    \\Phi_{f(e)}^A(x) \\simeq \\Phi_{s_1^1(v, e)}^A(x) \\simeq \\Phi_v^A(e, x) \\simeq \\Psi_e^A(e).\n    $$\n    So, we have found a total computable function $f$ such that for any oracle $A$, the $\\Phi$-machine with index $f(e)$ computes the function which is constant on its domain and whose halting behavior is identical to that of $\\Psi_e^A(e)$.\n\n7.  The equivalence $\\Phi_{f(e)}^A(x) \\simeq \\Psi_e^A(e)$ implies that halting is equivalent:\n    $$\n    \\Phi_{f(e)}^A(x) \\downarrow \\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\; \\Psi_e^A(e) \\downarrow \\quad \\text{for all } x.\n    $$\n\n8.  Since this equivalence holds for any input $x$ to the $\\Phi$-machine, it must hold for the specific input $x = f(e)$. Substituting this choice of input, we get:\n    $$\n    \\Phi_{f(e)}^A(f(e)) \\downarrow \\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\; \\Psi_e^A(e) \\downarrow.\n    $$\n\n9.  This is precisely the condition for a many-one reduction from $J_{\\Psi}(A)$ to $J_{\\Phi}(A)$, where $f$ is the reduction function. Thus, $J_{\\Psi}(A) \\leq_m J_{\\Phi}(A)$. The reduction is uniform in $A$ because the function $f$ is independent of $A$.\n\n10. The roles of $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ are symmetric. A completely analogous argument shows that there exists a total computable function $g$ such that $J_{\\Phi}(A) \\leq_m J_{\\Psi}(A)$.\n\n11. From $J_{\\Psi}(A) \\leq_m J_{\\Phi}(A)$ and $J_{\\Phi}(A) \\leq_m J_{\\Psi}(A)$, we conclude that $J_{\\Phi}(A)$ and $J_{\\Psi}(A)$ are many-one equivalent, written $J_{\\Phi}(A) \\equiv_m J_{\\Psi}(A)$.\n\n12. Since many-one reducibility implies Turing reducibility ($X \\leq_m Y \\implies X \\leq_T Y$), it follows immediately that $J_{\\Phi}(A) \\equiv_T J_{\\Psi}(A)$. The two sets belong to the same Turing degree.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. For any universal oracle machines $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$, there exists a total computable function $f$ such that for all sets $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ and all $e \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\Phi_{f(e)}^A\\!\\big(f(e)\\big) \\downarrow \\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\; \\Psi_e^A(e) \\downarrow$, so $J_{\\Psi}(A) \\leq_m J_{\\Phi}(A)$ uniformly in $A$, and symmetrically $J_{\\Phi}(A) \\leq_m J_{\\Psi}(A)$; hence $J_{\\Phi}(A)$ and $J_{\\Psi}(A)$ are Turing equivalent for every $A$.**\n\nThis statement accurately summarizes the derivation above. It correctly identifies that there exists a total computable function $f$ establishing a many-one reduction between the jump sets. It correctly formulates the reduction condition $\\Phi_{f(e)}^A(f(e)) \\downarrow \\iff \\Psi_e^A(e) \\downarrow$. It notes the symmetric nature of the argument and correctly concludes that $m$-equivalence implies Turing equivalence. The inclusion of \"uniformly in $A$\" is also correct, as the reduction function $f$ does not depend on the oracle $A$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The invariance can fail when $A$ is not computable, because the translation of indices between universal machines depends on the oracle $A$, so $J_{\\Phi}(A)$ and $J_{\\Psi}(A)$ need not be Turing equivalent for non-computable $A$.**\n\nThis statement is factually incorrect. A fundamental property of acceptable enumerations is that the translation of indices between them is achieved by a total computable function which is independent of any oracle. The s-m-n theorem, which provides this translation, constructs a function that manipulates program indices, a process that does not consult the oracle. The invariance of the jump operator's degree holds for *any* oracle $A$, computable or not.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The invariance only holds up to Turing reducibility and cannot be strengthened to many-one reducibility, because the diagonal input $e$ prevents a computable index translation that preserves halting on the diagonal.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. As demonstrated in the derivation, the invariance can be and is established via many-one reducibility ($J_{\\Phi}(A) \\equiv_m J_{\\Psi}(A)$). The reasoning provided in the option describes a potential pitfall: a naive translation of $\\Psi_e^A$ to $\\Phi_{g(e)}^A$ leads to checking $\\Phi_{g(e)}^A(e)$ instead of $\\Phi_{g(e)}^A(g(e))$. However, this is not an insurmountable obstacle. The s-m-n theorem allows for a more sophisticated construction (as shown in the main derivation) that builds a new machine specifically to resolve this \"diagonal mismatch,\" leading to a valid $m$-reduction.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The invariance relies essentially on the recursion theorem to produce fixed points for self-application, and without invoking the recursion theorem one cannot uniformly translate diagonal computations between two universal machines.**\n\nThis statement misidentifies the essential tool. The standard and most direct proof of the invariance, as detailed above, relies critically on the s-m-n (parameterization) theorem, not the recursion theorem. The s-m-n theorem is about computably parameterizing programs, which is exactly what is needed to construct the reduction function $f$. While the recursion theorem is a powerful tool for self-referential constructions, it is not necessary for this particular proof. The claim that one *cannot* prove it without the recursion theorem is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The invariance holds only if the machine enumerations are acceptable in the sense of Rogers, but there exist universal oracle machines that are not acceptable, for which the jump sets can have different Turing degrees across enumerations.**\n\nThe problem statement explicitly defines the universal machines $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ as \"acceptable enumerations\". Therefore, this option is stating a condition that is already given as a premise. While the underlying claim is true—for pathological (non-acceptable) numberings, the jump may not be invariant—it does not explain *why* the invariance holds in the specified case. It states a precondition for the result rather than explaining the mechanism of the proof. Option A provides the actual explanatory mechanism.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2986203"}, {"introduction": "The jump of the empty set, $0'$, represents the computational power inherent in the standard halting problem.

The implication $A \\leq_{m} 0' \\implies A \\leq_{T} 0'$ is true, as a many-one reduction can be used to construct a Turing reduction.

This would mean that $\\bar{0'}$ is a $\\Sigma^0_1$ set, because membership in $\\bar{0'}$ could be decided by checking if $g(x)$ is in the $\\Sigma^0_1$ set $0'$. However, $\\bar{0'}$ is known to be $\\Pi^0_1$-complete. If $\\bar{0'}$ were also $\\Sigma^0_1$, then it would be in $\\Delta^0_1$, which means it would be a computable set. This would imply its complement, $0'$, is also computable, which contradicts the undecidability of the halting problem.\nThus, $\\bar{0'}$ is in $\\Delta^0_2$ but is not many-one reducible to $0'$.

Then $A$ is, by definition, limit computable. From option A (Shoenfield's Limit Lemma), any limit computable set is in $\\Delta^{0}_{2}$. By the given Post's Theorem, any set in $\\Delta^{0}_{2}$ is Turing reducible to $0'$. This means the characteristic function of $A$, which is $L_f$, is $0'$-computable. So, the first part is true.\n\n2.  If an oracle $X$ computes $L_f$ for every such $f$, then $0' \\leq_{T} X$.\nTo prove $0' \\leq_{T} X$, we need to show that we can compute the characteristic function of $0'$ using oracle $X$. We must construct a specific total computable function $f_0 \\colon \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to \\{0,1\\}$ such that $\\chi_{0'}(e) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} f_0(e,s)$.\nLet's define $f_0(e,s)$ as follows:\n$f_0(e,s) = 1$ if the Turing machine with index $e$ on input $e$ halts in at most $s$ steps ($\\Phi_e(e) \\downarrow_s$).\n$f_0(e,s) = 0$ otherwise.\nThis function $f_0$ is total and computable.\nNow consider the limit:\nIf $e \\in 0'$, then $\\Phi_e(e)$ halts at some step $s_0$. For all $s \\ge s_0$, $f_0(e,s) = 1$. Thus, $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} f_0(e,s) = 1$.\nIf $e \\notin 0'$, then $\\Phi_e(e)$ never halts. For all $s$, $f_0(e,s) = 0$. Thus, $\\lim_{s \\to \\infty} f_0(e,s) = 0$.\nSo, $\\chi_{0'}(e) = \\lim_{s \\to \\infty} f_0(e,s)$.\nSince the oracle $X$ is assumed to be able to compute this limit for any input $e$, $X$ can compute $\\chi_{0'}$. By definition, this means $0' \\leq_{T} X$. The second part is also true.\nBoth parts of the statement are correct. The set $0'$ represents the computational power needed to determine limits of computable sequences, hence it is the weakest such oracle in the sense of Turing degrees.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. By Post's Theorem, $\\Delta^{0}_{2}$ coincides with the class of sets that are both recursively enumerable and co-recursively enumerable (that is, recursively enumerable and whose complement is recursively enumerable) in $\\emptyset$.\n\nThe class of sets that are \"recursively enumerable... in $\\emptyset$\" is simply the class of recursively enumerable (r.e.) sets, which is $\\Sigma^0_1$.\nThe class of sets that are \"co-recursively enumerable... in $\\emptyset$\" is the class of co-r.e. sets, which is $\\Pi^0_1$.\nA set is in the intersection of these two classes, $\\Sigma^0_1 \\cap \\Pi^0_1 = \\Delta^0_1$, if and only if it is computable (or recursive). This is a classical theorem by Post.\nThe statement asserts that $\\Delta^{0}_{2} = \\Delta^{0}_{1}$. This is false. The arithmetical hierarchy is a proper hierarchy, meaning $\\Delta^{0}_{1} \\subset \\Delta^{0}_{2}$. For example, the halting problem set $0'$ is in $\\Sigma^{0}_{1}$ but not in $\\Pi^{0}_{1}$, so it is not in $\\Delta^{0}_{1}$. However, $0'$ is in $\\Delta^{0}_{2}$ because $0' \\in \\Sigma^{0}_{1} \\subseteq \\Pi^{0}_{2}$ and $0' \\in \\Sigma^{0_1} \\subseteq \\Sigma^{0}_{2}$, hence $0' \\in \\Delta^0_2$. More simply, $0' \\leq_T 0'$, so by Post's theorem, $0' \\in \\Delta^0_2$. Since $0'$ is not computable, $0' \\notin \\Delta^0_1$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. A set $A$ belongs to $\\Delta^{0}_{2}$ if and only if both $A$ and its complement are recursively enumerable in $0'$ (equivalently, $A \\in \\Sigma^{0}_{1}(0') \\cap \\Pi^{0}_{1}(0')$), hence if and only if $A \\leq_{T} 0'$.\n\nThis statement asserts a chain of equivalences. Let's analyze them.\nThe condition \"both $A$ and its complement are recursively enumerable in $0'$\" is, by definition, $A \\in \\Sigma^{0}_{1}(0')$ and $\\bar{A} \\in \\Sigma^{0}_{1}(0')$.\nThe condition $\\bar{A} \\in \\Sigma^{0}_{1}(0')$ is equivalent to $A \\in \\Pi^{0}_{1}(0')$.\nSo, \"both $A$ and its complement are r.e. in $0'$\" is precisely equivalent to $A \\in \\Sigma^{0}_{1}(0') \\cap \\Pi^{0}_{1}(0')$. This is the class $\\Delta^{0}_{1}(0')$.\n\nThe relativized version of Post's theorem (that a set is computable iff it is r.e. and co-r.e.) states that a set $B$ is computable in an oracle $X$ (i.e., $B \\leq_T X$) if and only if $B$ is in $\\Delta^0_1(X)$. For our case, with $X=0'$ and $B=A$, this means $A \\leq_T 0' \\iff A \\in \\Delta^0_1(0')$.\n\nThe Jump Theorem, another fundamental result, states that for any $n \\ge 1$, a set is in $\\Sigma^0_{n+1}$ if and only if it is in $\\Sigma^0_n(0')$, and similarly for $\\Pi^0_{n+1}$ and $\\Pi^0_n(0')$.\nFor $n=1$, we get:\n$A \\in \\Sigma^{0}_{2} \\iff A \\in \\Sigma^{0}_{1}(0')$\n$A \\in \\Pi^{0}_{2} \\iff A \\in \\Pi^{0}_{1}(0')$\nCombining these, we get:\n$A \\in \\Delta^{0}_{2} \\iff A \\in (\\Sigma^{0}_{2} \\cap \\Pi^{0}_{2}) \\iff A \\in (\\Sigma^{0}_{1}(0') \\cap \\Pi^{0}_{1}(0')) \\iff A \\in \\Delta^{0}_{1}(0')$.\n\nPutting it all together, we have the following string of equivalences, all of which are standard theorems:\n$A \\in \\Delta^{0}_{2} \\iff A \\in \\Delta^{0}_{1}(0') \\iff A \\leq_{T} 0'$.\nThe statement correctly lays out these equivalences. The first part states $A \\in \\Delta^{0}_{2} \\iff A \\in \\Delta^{0}_{1}(0')$. The \"hence\" part connects this to $A \\leq_T 0'$, which is also a correct equivalence. In fact, the problem statement provides $A \\in \\Delta^0_2 \\iff A \\leq_T 0'$ directly. This option correctly adds the intermediate characterization in terms of relativized recursive enumerability.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2986207"}, {"introduction": "Having established the jump's properties, a natural and deep question arises: can we invert the jump operator?

This exercise introduces you to Sacks's Jump Theorem, a landmark result that affirmatively answers this question for the computably enumerable degrees, and provides insight into the powerful priority method used to perform such constructions [@problem_id:2986200].", "problem": "You are given a set-theoretic version of the jump operator in computability theory.

The Turing degree of $A$ is its equivalence class under Turing reducibility.\n- For sets $X, Y \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$, $X \\leq_T Y$ means $X$ is Turing reducible to $Y$, and $X \\equiv_T Y$ means $X \\leq_T Y$ and $Y \\leq_T X$.

For every set $B$ with $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$, there exists a computably enumerable set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T B$. The construction proceeds by a finite-injury priority argument with movable markers implementing two types of requirements: coding requirements ensuring a fixed Turing functional $\\Gamma$ satisfies $\\Gamma^{A'} = B$, and restraint requirements ensuring that a fixed functional $\\Delta$ satisfies $\\Delta^B = A'$. To ensure $A$ is computably enumerable, one never uses $B$ as an oracle to decide when to enumerate elements into $A$; rather, all enumerations into $A$ are triggered by computable events internal to the construction (e.g., injuries, marker movements, and satisfaction of local restraints). The reduction $\\Delta$ is defined so that $B$ decides, from the externally verified stabilization of the construction, which computations relative to $A$ are permanent, yielding $A' \\leq_T B$. The assumption $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$ is necessary because the range of the jump on any degree is above $\\mathbf{0'}$.\n\nB. For every set $B$, there exists a computably enumerable set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T B$. One ensures $A$ is computably enumerable by performing a permitting construction that at each step queries $B$ to decide whether to enumerate a number into $A$. Because the construction uses $B$ directly, $A$ is computably enumerable in the empty oracle and $A' \\equiv_T B$ holds without any lower bound on $B$.\n\nC. For every set $B$ with $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$, there exists a computable (decidable) set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T B$. The construction uses a limit approximation to $B$ and permits enumeration into $A$ only when the approximation stabilizes; this makes $A$ computable and guarantees $A' \\equiv_T B$.\n\nD. For every set $B$ with $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$, there exists a computably enumerable set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T B$. One ensures $A$ is computably enumerable by a permitting construction that waits for a computable approximation $\\langle B_s : s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rangle$ to $B$ to grant permission for enumerations; when $B_s$ changes, one enumerates new numbers into $A$ to destroy computations as needed.

The Turing degree of $A$ is its equivalence class under Turing reducibility.\n- For sets $X, Y \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$, $X \\leq_T Y$ means $X$ is Turing reducible to $Y$.\n- $X \\equiv_T Y$ means $X \\leq_T Y$ and $Y \\leq_T X$.\n- $\\mathbf{0'}$ denotes the degree of the halting problem $K$.\n- The jump of a set $X$ is $X' = \\{ \\langle e, x \\rangle : \\Phi_e^X(x) \\downarrow \\}$, where $\\Phi_e^X$ is the $e$-th Turing functional with oracle $X$.\n- The question is to identify the option that correctly states Sacks's Jump Theorem specialized to c.e. degrees and correctly explains the construction paradigm used to build the required c.e. set $A$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement itself is composed of standard, correct definitions from computability theory and poses a well-defined question about a major theorem in the field.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The concepts presented (computably enumerable sets, Turing reducibility, the jump operator, the halting problem degree $\\mathbf{0'}$) are cornerstones of computability theory. Sacks's Jump Theorem is a celebrated result in this area. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks to identify the correct statement of a theorem and a correct description of its proof technique from a list of options. This is a clear and unambiguous task. A correct answer exists within the established body of mathematical logic.\n- **Objective:** The language used is formal and precise, adhering to the standard terminology of the field. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements in the problem setup.\n\nThe problem setup exhibits none of the invalidity flaws. It is a valid, advanced question in mathematical logic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed to derive the solution by evaluating each option.\n\nThe problem concerns Sacks's Jump Theorem for computably enumerable degrees. This theorem states that the range of the Turing jump operator applied to the set of all computably enumerable degrees is precisely the set of all Turing degrees greater than or equal to $\\mathbf{0'}$. Formally, for any Turing degree $\\mathbf{b}$ such that $\\mathbf{b} \\geq \\mathbf{0'}$, there exists a computably enumerable degree $\\mathbf{a}$ such that $\\mathbf{a}' = \\mathbf{b}$. In terms of sets, for any set $B \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ such that $B \\geq_T K$ (where $K$ is the halting set), there exists a computably enumerable set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ such that $A' \\equiv_T B$.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is a highly complex priority construction. The goal is to build a c.e. set $A$ meeting the degree requirement $A' \\equiv_T B$. This means we must satisfy two conditions simultaneously: $A' \\leq_T B$ and $B \\leq_T A'$.\n\n1.  **Ensuring $A$ is computably enumerable (c.e.):** The construction of $A$ proceeds in stages, $A = \\bigcup_{s \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_s$. To ensure $A$ is c.e., the process of deciding which numbers to add to $A_s$ to form $A_{s+1}$ must be a computable procedure. Specifically, it must not use any non-computable oracle like $B$.\n\n2.  **Ensuring $A' \\leq_T B$ (The \"Restraint\" Side):** This requires constructing a Turing functional $\\Delta$ such that $\\Delta^B$ computes $A'$. The essence of this is that an oracle for $B$ must be able to resolve questions about the limit behavior of the computable construction of $A$. Whether a computation $\\Phi_e^A(x)$ converges depends on a finite initial segment of $A$. During the construction, provisional computations may be injured when new numbers are enumerated into $A$. The condition $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$ means the oracle $B$ is powerful enough to determine which requirements in the priority construction are injured only finitely many times and eventually become stable. This allows $B$ to determine the true, final value of any computation relative to $A$, thus computing $A'$.\n\n3.  **Ensuring $B \\leq_T A'$ (The \"Coding\" Side):** This requires constructing a Turing functional $\\Gamma$ such that $\\Gamma^{A'}$ computes $B$. This is achieved by coding the information of $B$ into the jump $A'$. For each number $e$, the construction tries to ensure that some property detectable by a $A'$-oracle holds if and only if $e \\in B$. For instance, one might designate a specific partial computable functional $\\Phi_{i_e}$ and try to arrange the enumeration of $A$ so that $\\Phi_{i_e}^A(i_e) \\downarrow$ if and only if $e \\in B$. Since the construction of $A$ cannot query $B$, it must act on some form of approximation. The fact that $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$ is essential for organizing the coding requirements in a workable priority framework.\n\nNow I will analyze each option based on these principles.\n\n**Option A Evaluation:**\n- **Theorem Statement:** \"For every set $B$ with $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$, there exists a computably enumerable set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T B$.\" This is the correct statement of Sacks's Jump Theorem for c.e. degrees.\n- **Explanation of Construction:**\n    - The method for ensuring $A$ is c.e. is described as: \"one never uses $B$ as an oracle to decide when to enumerate elements into $A$; rather, all enumerations into $A$ are triggered by computable events internal to the construction\". This is a precise and correct description of how a set is constructed to be computably enumerable in a priority argument.\n    - The dual goals are correctly identified as \"coding requirements\" for $B \\leq_T A'$ and \"restraint requirements\" for $A' \\leq_T B$.\n    - The mechanism for $A' \\leq_T B$ is explained as \"$B$ decides, from the externally verified stabilization of the construction, which computations relative to $A$ are permanent\". This is an accurate high-level description of the role of the oracle $B$.\n    - The priority method is mentioned (\"finite-injury priority argument\"). The actual proof is typically an infinite-injury ($\\mathbf{0'}$) priority argument, which is more complex. However, \"finite-injury\" still correctly places the technique within the family of priority arguments, and in the context of a multiple-choice question, this is a reasonable description compared to the fundamental errors in other options.\n    - The necessity of the condition $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$ is correctly explained: the range of any jump must be above $\\mathbf{0'}$.\nThis option captures all the key concepts correctly.\n\n**Verdict for A: Correct**\n\n**Option B Evaluation:**\n- **Theorem Statement:** \"For every set $B$, there exists a computably enumerable set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T B$.\" This is false. The condition $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$ is necessary, as the jump of any set has a degree at least $\\mathbf{0'}$.\n- **Explanation of Construction:** \"performing a permitting construction that at each step queries $B$ to decide whether to enumerate a number into $A$.\" This is a fatal contradiction. If the construction queries $B$, the resulting set $A$ is c.e. *in $B$*, not computably enumerable (which means c.e. in the empty set, $\\emptyset$). This violates the requirement that $A$ is a c.e. set.\n\n**Verdict for B: Incorrect**\n\n**Option C Evaluation:**\n- **Theorem Statement:** \"For every set $B$ with $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$, there exists a computable (decidable) set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T B$.\" This is false. A computable set $A$ has degree $\\mathbf{0}$, and its jump is $A' \\equiv_T \\mathbf{0'}$. The theorem must hold for any $B$ with degree $\\geq \\mathbf{0'}$, such as $B \\equiv_T \\mathbf{0''}$. It is not possible to find a computable set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T \\mathbf{0''}$. Sacks's theorem guarantees a *c.e.* set, not necessarily a computable one.\n\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect**\n\n**Option D Evaluation:**\n- **Theorem Statement:** \"For every set $B$ with $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$, there exists a computably enumerable set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T B$.\" The statement is correct.\n- **Explanation of Construction:** The explanation hinges on the claim that \"every such $B$ [with $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$] admits a computable approximation $\\langle B_s : s \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rangle$\". This claim is false. By the Limit Lemma, a set has a computable approximation if and only if its degree is computable from $\\mathbf{0'}$ (i.e., it is a $\\Delta_2^0$ set). The condition $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$ allows for sets of much higher complexity (e.g., $\\mathbf{0''}$, $\\mathbf{0'''}$, etc.), which do not have computable approximations. The entire explanatory mechanism is based on a false premise.\n\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect**\n\n**Option E Evaluation:**\n- This option presents a garbled and incorrect set of claims.\n- The first part, \"For every computably enumerable degree $\\mathbf{a}$ there exists a degree $\\mathbf{b}$ such that $\\mathbf{a'} \\equiv \\mathbf{b'}$\", is trivially true (let $\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{a}$) and irrelevant to the theorem in question.\n- The proposed construction method is nonsensical. If $B$ is c.e. and we set $A=B$, we require $B' \\equiv_T B$. This is only true for a specific class of c.e. degrees known as \"high\" degrees, and even then, their jump is $\\mathbf{0''}$, not an arbitrary degree $B$. For an arbitrary $B \\geq_T \\mathbf{0'}$, this fails. For example, if $B \\equiv_T \\mathbf{0'}$, then $B$ is c.e.-complete. We would need to find a c.e. set $A$ such that $A' \\equiv_T \\mathbf{0'}$. If we set $A=B$, then $A' = B' \\equiv_T \\mathbf{0''}$, which is not $\\mathbf{0'}$.\n- The \"otherwise\" case is also wrong: if $B >_T \\mathbf{0'}$, we cannot take $A = \\emptyset$ because $\\emptyset' \\equiv_T \\mathbf{0'} \\not\\equiv_T B$.\n\n**Verdict for E: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly states the theorem and provides a correct, albeit high-level, description of the proof methodology. While the specific mention of \"finite-injury\" might be a simplification of what is a more complex \"infinite-injury\" argument, all other aspects of the explanation are sound, and the other options contain definitive logical or factual errors.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2986200"}]}
