The definitions are precise and sufficient to attempt a solution.\n-   **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of subjectivity.\n-   **No other flaws detected:** The problem is complete, consistent, formalizable, and non-trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Equivalence of $[\\langle n \\rangle \\top]^{*}$ and $Con^{n}(PA)$**\n\nWe are asked to show that for each natural number $n \\geq 1$, the arithmetical sentence $[\\langle n \\rangle \\top]^{*}$ is provably equivalent in $PA$ to $Con^{n}(PA)$. We proceed by induction on $n$.\n\n**Base Case ($n=1$):**\nWe need to show $PA \\vdash [\\langle 1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{1}(PA)$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is $[\\langle 1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} = [\\Diamond \\top]^{*}$. According to the given arithmetical interpretation, $[\\Diamond \\varphi]^{*} = \\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner (\\neg \\varphi)^{*} \\urcorner)$.\nLet $\\varphi = \\top$. A standard arithmetical representation for $\\top$ is a simple true statement like $0=0$. Its negation, $\\neg\\top$, is represented by $0 \\neq 0$ or, as is common, $0=1$, which represents falsity ($\\bot$).\nSo, $(\\neg \\top)^{*}$ is the sentence $0=1$.\nThus, $[\\Diamond \\top]^{*} = \\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$.\nThe provability predicate $\\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(y)$ is defined as $\\exists p \\, \\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p, y)$.\nTherefore, $[\\Diamond \\top]^{*} = \\neg (\\exists p \\, \\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner))$, which is logically equivalent to $\\forall p \\, \\neg \\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$.\nThis is precisely the definition of $Con(PA)$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is $Con^{1}(PA)$. By definition, $Con^{n+1}(PA) := Con(T_n)$. For $n=0$, this gives $Con^{1}(PA) = Con(T_0)$. Since $T_0 := PA$, we have $Con^{1}(PA) = Con(PA)$.\nThus, LHS and RHS are both identical to $Con(PA)$, so $PA \\vdash [\\langle 1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{1}(PA)$. The base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume for some $k \\geq 1$ that $PA \\vdash [\\langle k \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{k}(PA)$.\nWe want to show that $PA \\vdash [\\langle k+1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{k+1}(PA)$.\n\nLet's analyze the LHS: $[\\langle k+1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} = [\\Diamond (\\langle k \\rangle \\top)]^{*}$.\nUsing the arithmetical interpretation, this is $\\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner (\\neg \\langle k \\rangle \\top)^{*} \\urcorner)$.\nThe translation of negation is standard, so $(\\neg \\langle k \\rangle \\top)^{*} = \\neg ([\\langle k \\rangle \\top]^{*})$.\nBy the inductive hypothesis, $PA \\vdash [\\langle k \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{k}(PA)$. Since this equivalence is provable in $PA$, $PA$ can also prove the equivalence of their negations and the corresponding provability statements. Therefore,\n$$PA \\vdash \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg ([\\langle k \\rangle \\top]^{*}) \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg Con^{k}(PA) \\urcorner)$$\nThis implies:\n$$PA \\vdash [\\langle k+1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\operatorname{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg Con^{k}(PA) \\urcorner)$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the RHS: $Con^{k+1}(PA)$.\nBy definition, $Con^{k+1}(PA) = Con(T_k)$ where $T_k = T_{k-1} + Con(T_{k-1})$. As we will prove in Part 3, $PA \\vdash Con^{m+1}(PA) \\to Con^{m}(PA)$ for all $m \\ge 0$. This implies that the theories $T_k = PA+Con(T_0)+\\dots+Con(T_{k-1})$ and $PA+Con(T_{k-1})$ are equivalent, since adding $Con(T_{k-1})$ as an axiom allows one to prove all previous consistency statements $Con(T_i)$ for $i<k-1$. Thus, provably in $PA$, $Th(T_k) = Th(PA+Con(T_{k-1}))$.\nTherefore, $PA \\vdash Con(T_k) \\leftrightarrow Con(PA+Con(T_{k-1}))$.\nUsing the problem's notation, this means $PA \\vdash Con^{k+1}(PA) \\leftrightarrow Con(PA+Con^k(PA))$.\n\nA standard result in the metamathematics of arithmetic (formalized deduction theorem) states that for a recursively enumerable theory $S$ and a sentence $\\psi$, $PA \\vdash \\mathrm{Pr}_{S+\\psi}(\\ulcorner \\chi \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{Pr}_{S}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\to \\chi \\urcorner)$. Setting $S=PA$ and $\\chi=\\bot$, we get $\\mathrm{Pr}_{PA+\\psi}(\\ulcorner \\bot \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\to \\bot \\urcorner) \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg \\psi \\urcorner)$.\nTaking the negation of both sides gives $Con(PA+\\psi) \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\mathrm{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg \\psi \\urcorner)$.\nLetting $\\psi = Con^k(PA)$, we have:\n$$PA \\vdash Con(PA+Con^k(PA)) \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\mathrm{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg Con^k(PA) \\urcorner)$$\nCombining our findings for the RHS, we have:\n$$PA \\vdash Con^{k+1}(PA) \\leftrightarrow \\neg \\mathrm{Pr}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\neg Con^{k}(PA) \\urcorner)$$\nComparing the equivalences for the LHS and RHS, we conclude that $PA \\vdash [\\langle k+1 \\rangle \\top]^{*} \\leftrightarrow Con^{k+1}(PA)$.\nThe induction is complete.\n\n**Part 2: Arithmetical Hierarchy Classification**\n\nWe need to determine the classification of the sentence $Con^n(PA)$ in the arithmetical hierarchy ($\\Sigma^0_k, \\Pi^0_k$) for a fixed $n \\geq 1$.\nThe arithmetical hierarchy classifies formulas based on the alternation of unbounded quantifiers, assuming the quantifier-free part is recursive. A formula is $\\Pi_k^0$ if it is of the form $\\forall x_1 \\exists x_2 \\dots Q x_k R(\\dots)$ with $R$ recursive, and $\\Sigma_k^0$ if it starts with $\\exists$.\n\nConsider $Con^1(PA) = Con(PA) = \\forall p \\, \\neg \\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$.\nThe set of axioms of $PA$ is recursive. The relation $\\operatorname{Proof}_{PA}(p,y)$, which states that $p$ is the Gödel number of a valid proof in $PA$ of the formula with Gödel number $y$, is therefore a primitive recursive relation. A primitive recursive relation is decided by an algorithm that always halts, and its defining logical formula is $\\Delta_1^0$ (equivalent to both a $\\Sigma_1^0$ and a $\\Pi_1^0$ formula). Let's denote the recursive kernel by $R(p,y)$.\nThus, $Con(PA)$ has the form $\\forall p \\, \\neg R(p, \\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$. This is a universal quantifier over a recursive predicate, which by definition is a $\\Pi_1^0$ formula.\n\nNow consider $Con^n(PA)$ for an arbitrary fixed $n > 1$.\n$Con^n(PA) = Con(T_{n-1})$.\nThe theory $T_{n-1}$ is defined by the progression $T_0 = PA$, $T_{k+1} = T_k + Con(T_k)$.\nFor any fixed $n$, the theory $T_{n-1}$ is $PA$ augmented with a finite number of axioms: $Con(T_0), Con(T_1), \\dots, Con(T_{n-2})$.\nLet $A_k$ be the axiom set of $T_k$. Then $A_k = A_{k-1} \\cup \\{ Con(T_{k-1}) \\}$.\nFor any given formula $\\phi$, one can algorithmically decide if it belongs to this set: check if it is an axiom of $PA$ (recursive check), or if it is one of the finitely many sentences $Con(T_0), \\dots, Con(T_{n-2})$. Since $n$ is fixed, this is a finite list of sentences to check against.\nTherefore, for any fixed $n$, the axiom set of $T_{n-1}$ is a recursive set.\n\nSince $T_{n-1}$ has a recursive set of axioms, the proof predicate $\\operatorname{Proof}_{T_{n-1}}(p,y)$ is a recursive relation, just as in the case for $PA$.\nThe sentence $Con^{n}(PA) = Con(T_{n-1})$ is defined as:\n$$Con(T_{n-1}) := \\forall p \\, \\neg \\operatorname{Proof}_{T_{n-1}}\\!\\left(p, \\ulcorner 0 = 1 \\urcorner\\right)$$\nThis formula consists of a single universal quantifier over a recursive predicate. Hence, for any fixed $n \\geq 1$, the sentence $Con^n(PA)$ is a $\\Pi_1^0$ sentence. While this might seem counter-intuitive to the idea of the Turing progression generating ever-more-complex statements of unprovability, it is the direct consequence of the definitions provided and standard hierarchy classification. The complexity increase in the Turing progression is often discussed in terms of the strength of the theories or non-uniform complexity, but for a fixed $n$, the syntactic form of the standard consistency statement remains $\\Pi_1^0$.\n\n**Part 3: Monotonicity of Iterated Consistency**\n\nWe need to prove in $PA$ that for every $n \\geq 0$, $Con^{n+1}(PA) \\to Con^{n}(PA)$.\n\nCase $n=0$: We must show $PA \\vdash Con^{1}(PA) \\to Con^{0}(PA)$.\nBy definition, $Con^{1}(PA) = Con(PA)$ and $Con^{0}(PA) = \\top$. The statement is $PA \\vdash Con(PA) \\to \\top$. This is an instance of the logical tautology $A \\to \\top$, which is provable in any standard logical system, including the one underlying $PA$.\n\nCase $n \\geq 1$: We must show $PA \\vdash Con^{n+1}(PA) \\to Con^{n}(PA)$.\nBy definition, $Con^{n+1}(PA) = Con(T_n)$ and $Con^{n}(PA) = Con(T_{n-1})$. So we need to show $PA \\vdash Con(T_n) \\to Con(T_{n-1})$.\n\nThe theory $T_n$ is defined as $T_{n-1} + Con(T_{n-1})$. This means the set of axioms of $T_{n-1}$ is a subset of the set of axioms of $T_n$.\nAny proof in $T_{n-1}$ is also a valid proof in $T_n$.\nThis implies that any sentence provable in $T_{n-1}$ is also provable in $T_n$.\nThis reasoning can be formalized within $PA$. Let $\\mathrm{Pr}_{S}(\\ulcorner\\phi\\urcorner)$ be the formula asserting that $\\phi$ is provable in theory $S$. The inclusion of axiom sets implies:\n$$PA \\vdash \\mathrm{Pr}_{T_{n-1}}(\\ulcorner\\phi\\urcorner) \\to \\mathrm{Pr}_{T_n}(\\ulcorner\\phi\\urcorner)$$\nfor any sentence $\\phi$. Let us set $\\phi$ to be the sentence for falsity, $0=1$.\n$$PA \\vdash \\mathrm{Pr}_{T_{n-1}}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner) \\to \\mathrm{Pr}_{T_n}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$$\nBy taking the contrapositive of this implication within PA's logic, we get:\n$$PA \\vdash \\neg \\mathrm{Pr}_{T_n}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner) \\to \\neg \\mathrm{Pr}_{T_{n-1}}(\\ulcorner 0=1 \\urcorner)$$\nBy the definition of the consistency operator $Con(\\cdot)$, this is precisely:\n$$PA \\vdash Con(T_n) \\to Con(T_{n-1})$$\nSubstituting the definitions for iterated consistency:\n$$PA \\vdash Con^{n+1}(PA) \\to Con^{n}(PA)$$\nThis holds for all $n \\geq 1$. Combining with the $n=0$ case, the property is proven for all $n \\geq 0$.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe problem asks for the hierarchy class computed in Part 2. As demonstrated, for any fixed $n \\geq 1$, the sentence $Con^n(PA)$ is a $\\Pi_1^0$ sentence.

All concepts mentioned—$GL$, $PA$, $Prov_{PA}(x)$, $RProv_{PA}(x)$, the HBL conditions, and Solovay's theorems—are standard, well-defined, and central to the field. The properties attributed to $Prov_{PA}$ and $RProv_{PA}$ are accurate. The problem is factually and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The question is precise. It asks for the identification of specific failure points in a well-known mathematical proof (Solovay's completeness proof) when a key component ($Prov_{PA}$) is substituted with an alternative ($RProv_{PA}$) that lacks certain specified properties ($D2, D3$). This structure admits a definite and verifiable answer based on the details of the proof.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in formal, technical language, free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question within mathematical logic. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to identify which parts of Solovay's arithmetical completeness proof for $GL$ depend critically on the derivability conditions $D2$ and $D3$. These are the conditions that the standard provability predicate $Prov_{PA}$ satisfies but a Rosser-type predicate $RProv_{PA}$ does not.\n\nSolovay's theorem has two main parts: soundness ($GL \\vdash \\theta \\Rightarrow$ for all substitutions $*, PA \\vdash \\theta^*$) and completeness ($GL \\not\\vdash \\theta \\Rightarrow$ there exists a substitution $*$ such that $PA \\not\\vdash \\theta^*$). Both parts rely on the HBL conditions. We will analyze each option.\n\n**A. The construction of arithmetical fixed points (via the diagonal lemma) for the realization of modal formulas fundamentally requires $D2$, so the fixed-point step cannot be carried out for $RProv_{PA}$.**\n\nThe Diagonal Lemma states that for any formula $\\Psi(x)$ in the language of arithmetic with one free variable $x$, there exists a sentence $\\varphi$ such that $PA \\vdash \\varphi \\leftrightarrow \\Psi(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$. The proof of this lemma is a general result about the expressive power of theories like $PA$ that can represent their own syntax. The proof does not depend on the specific properties of the formula $\\Psi(x)$, other than its being a formula of the language. The Rosser provability predicate, $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}(x)$, is given by a $\\Sigma_1$ formula, and thus the Diagonal Lemma applies to it without issue. For instance, the classic Rosser sentence $\\rho$ is constructed as a fixed point $PA \\vdash \\rho \\leftrightarrow \\exists y (Proof_{PA}(y, \\ulcorner \\rho \\urcorner) \\land \\forall z \\le y \\neg Proof_{PA}(z, \\ulcorner \\neg \\rho \\urcorner))$. One can just as easily construct fixed points involving $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}$. The construction of fixed points is therefore possible. The issue is not the existence of such fixed points, but the provable properties they possess, which in turn depend on the properties of the predicate used. Hence, this statement is factually incorrect.\n\n**Verdict for A: Incorrect**\n\n**B. In the truth lemma for $\\Box$, to infer $PA \\vdash A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^\\ast \\urcorner)$ from the inductive hypotheses $PA \\vdash A_v \\to \\theta^\\ast$ for all $v$ with $w R v$, one needs $D2$ to pass from $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\to \\theta^\\ast \\urcorner)$ to $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urcorner) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^\\ast \\urcorner)$ and then combine this with $PA \\vdash A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urcorner)$; without $D2$ this chain of implications fails for $RProv_{PA}$.**\n\nThis option describes a crucial step in the inductive proof of the \"truth lemma\" which connects the Kripke model semantics to arithmetical provability. The lemma states that for any formula $\\psi$ and any world $w$ in the finite Kripke counter-model, $w \\models \\psi \\iff PA \\vdash A_w \\to \\psi^*$, where $\\psi^*$ is the arithmetical realization of $\\psi$ and $A_w$ is the arithmetical sentence corresponding to world $w$.\n\nConsider the inductive step for a formula $\\Box\\theta$, assuming the lemma holds for $\\theta$. Suppose $w \\models \\Box\\theta$. This means for all successor worlds $v$ such that $w R v$, we have $v \\models \\theta$.\nBy the inductive hypothesis ($IH$), for all such $v$, we have $PA \\vdash A_v \\to \\theta^*$.\nA crucial feature of the construction of the sentences $A_w$ in Solovay's proof is that for each successor $v$ of $w$ ($w R v$), we have $PA \\vdash A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urcorner)$ (or a related property concerning disjunctions of successors).\nNow, from the $IH$ ($PA \\vdash A_v \\to \\theta^*$), by condition $D1$ (as a rule of inference), it follows that $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\to \\theta^* \\urcorner)$.\nHere, we must apply condition $D2$: $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\to \\theta^* \\urcorner) \\to (Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urcorner) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^* \\urcorner))$.\nCombining these steps, we can reason within $PA$:\n$A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urcorner)$ (from construction)\n$Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner A_v \\urcorner) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^* \\urcorner)$ (from $IH$, $D1$, $D2$)\nTherefore, $PA \\vdash A_w \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\theta^* \\urcorner)$, which is $PA \\vdash A_w \\to (\\Box\\theta)^*$.\n\nThis chain of reasoning explicitly and indispensably uses $D2$ to distribute the provability predicate over the implication derived from the inductive hypothesis. If $Prov_{PA}$ were replaced by $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}$, for which $D2$ does not hold, this inference would be blocked, and the inductive proof of the truth lemma would fail. This statement accurately pinpoints a critical failure point.\n\n**Verdict for B: Correct**\n\n**C. The completeness proof relies on the schema $D1$ in the form $PA \\vdash \\varphi \\Rightarrow PA \\vdash RProv_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner)$, which is invalid for $RProv_{PA}$ and thereby breaks the proof at the soundness step.**\n\nThis statement claims that $D1$ is invalid for $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}$. However, the problem statement explicitly notes that \"$RProv_{PA}(x)$ can be arranged to satisfy $D1$.\" This is standard. A Rosser predicate can be defined as $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urcorner) \\equiv \\exists p (Proof_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\land (\\forall q < p) \\neg Proof_{PA}(q, \\ulcorner \\neg\\varphi \\urvenir))$. If $PA \\vdash \\varphi$, then there exists a proof of $\\varphi$, and (assuming $PA$ is consistent) no proof of $\\neg\\varphi$. Thus, $\\exists p (Proof_{PA}(p, \\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\land ...)$ is true. Since this is a $\\Sigma_1$ sentence, its truth implies its provability in $PA$, so $PA \\vdash \\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$. Therefore, $D1$ holds for $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}$. The premise of the option is false.\n\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The verification that the arithmetical interpretation of Löb’s axiom $\\Box(\\Box \\varphi \\to \\varphi) \\to \\Box \\varphi$ is provable in $PA$ uses $D3$ to internalize the step from $Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$ to $Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\urvenir)$ within $PA$; since $RProv_{PA}$ fails $D3$, the arithmetical counterpart of Löb’s axiom may not be provable, undermining completeness.**\n\nThis addresses the arithmetical soundness of $GL$, a foundational part of Solovay's result. For $GL$ to be the logic of provability in $PA$, its axioms must be provable in $PA$ under the arithmetical interpretation. The characteristic axiom of $GL$ is Löb's axiom, $\\Box(\\Box p \\to p) \\to \\Box p$. Its arithmetical interpretation is the schema $Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir) \\to \\varphi \\urvenir) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$. The proof that this schema holds for any sentence $\\varphi$ is Löb's theorem.\n\nThe proof of Löb's theorem formalized within $PA$ centrally uses all three HBL conditions. A key step in the proof involves reasoning about a fixed-point sentence $\\psi$ such that $PA \\vdash \\psi \\leftrightarrow (Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir) \\to \\varphi)$. The proof proceeds to establish $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir) \\to Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\varphi \\urvenir)$. This sub-proof requires inferring $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir) \\urvenir)$ from $PA \\vdash Prov_{PA}(\\ulcorner \\psi \\urvenir)$. This is a direct application of condition $D3$. Without $D3$, this step is not possible, and the proof of Löb's theorem fails.\n\nIf $Prov_{PA}$ is replaced with $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}$, for which $D3$ does not hold, the arithmetical interpretation of Löb's axiom is no longer provable in $PA$. This is a catastrophic failure. It means that the proposed logic (the interpretation of $GL$ via $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}$) does not even satisfy its own axioms, so it cannot be a coherent provability logic. This fundamentally \"undermines completeness\" because the entire framework relating the logic $GL$ to the arithmetical interpretation would collapse.\n\n**Verdict for D: Correct**\n\n**E. The completeness proof fails because the Kripke frames for $GL$ are not well-founded; using $RProv_{PA}$ corrects this by enforcing $\\omega$-consistency at the frame level, which the proof requires.**\n\nThis statement contains multiple inaccuracies.\n$1$. The Kripke semantics for $GL$ is sound and complete with respect to the class of finite, transitive, and irreflexive frames. An irreflexive relation on a finite set is necessarily *converse well-founded* (i.e., it has no infinite ascending chains), which is the required property. The statement that the frames are \"not well-founded\" is incorrect in the context of the proof.\n$2$. The role of the Rosser predicate is misrepresented. The standard Gödel sentence $G$ requires the assumption of $\\omega$-consistency of $PA$ to prove its truth (i.e., its unprovability). Rosser's construction with $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}$ was specifically designed to prove the incompleteness of $PA$ using only the weaker assumption of simple consistency. Thus, $\\mathrm{RProv}_{PA}$ is a tool to *avoid* reliance on $\\omega$-consistency, not to \"enforce\" it.\n$3$. The idea of enforcing $\\omega$-consistency \"at the frame level\" is conceptually confused. $\\omega$-consistency is a property of an arithmetical theory, not a Kripke frame.\nThis option misunderstands several fundamental concepts.\n\n**Verdict for E: Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, options B and D correctly identify indispensable uses of the HBL conditions ($D2$ and $D3$) that are part of Solovay's arithmetical proof system for $GL$ and which fail for a Rosser-type provability predicate.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BD}$$", "id": "2980166"}]}
