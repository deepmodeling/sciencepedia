The definition is as follows, where on the right-hand side, juxtaposition of symbols denotes string concatenation.\n\nLet $\\varphi$ be an arbitrary well-formed formula in $\\mathsf{Fm}$. The translation $P(\\varphi)$ is defined by cases according to the structure of $\\varphi$:\n1.  **Base Case:** If $\\varphi$ is a propositional variable, i.e., $\\varphi \\in \\mathsf{Var}$, then its arity is $\\mathrm{ar}(\\varphi)=0$.

This means that for any two formulas $\\varphi, \\psi \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$, if $P(\\varphi)$ is a proper prefix of $P(\\psi)$, a contradiction arises.\n\nTo prove this, we first establish a crucial property of the strings in $P[\\mathsf{Fm}]$ related to the arity of their constituent symbols. Let $w = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\dots \\sigma_k$ be a string in $\\Sigma^{\\ast}$. We define the **balance** of $w$, denoted $\\beta(w)$, as:\n$$ \\beta(w) := \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (\\mathrm{ar}(\\sigma_i) - 1) $$\n\nWe will prove two lemmas about strings in $P[\\mathsf{Fm}]$ by structural induction on the formula $\\varphi$.\n\n**Lemma 1:** For any formula $\\varphi \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$, the balance of its Polish translation is $\\beta(P(\\varphi)) = -1$.\n\n*   **Proof by Structural Induction:**\n    *   **Base Case:** Let $\\varphi = p$ where $p \\in \\mathsf{Var}$. Then $P(p) = p$. The balance is $\\beta(p) = \\mathrm{ar}(p) - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1$. The lemma holds.\n    *   **Inductive Step (Unary):** Assume the lemma holds for a formula $\\psi \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$, i.e., $\\beta(P(\\psi)) = -1$. Consider the formula $\\varphi = \\neg \\psi$. Its translation is $P(\\varphi) = \\neg P(\\psi)$. The balance is:\n        $$ \\beta(P(\\varphi)) = (\\mathrm{ar}(\\neg) - 1) + \\beta(P(\\psi)) = (1-1) + (-1) = -1 $$\n        The lemma holds for $\\varphi = \\neg \\psi$.\n    *   **Inductive Step (Binary):** Assume the lemma holds for formulas $\\psi, \\chi \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$, i.e., $\\beta(P(\\psi)) = -1$ and $\\beta(P(\\chi)) = -1$. Consider the formula $\\varphi = (\\psi \\circ \\chi)$ where $\\circ \\in \\{\\land, \\lor, \\to\\}$. Its translation is $P(\\varphi) = \\circ P(\\psi) P(\\chi)$. The balance is:\n        $$ \\beta(P(\\varphi)) = (\\mathrm{ar}(\\circ) - 1) + \\beta(P(\\psi)) + \\beta(P(\\chi)) = (2-1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1 $$\n        The lemma holds for $\\varphi = (\\psi \\circ \\chi)$.\n\nBy the principle of structural induction, Lemma 1 holds for all $\\varphi \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$.\n\n**Lemma 2:** For any formula $\\varphi \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$, every proper prefix of $P(\\varphi)$ has a non-negative balance.\n\n*   **Proof by Structural Induction:**\n    *   **Base Case:** Let $\\varphi = p$ where $p \\in \\mathsf{Var}$. Then $P(p) = p$. This string has no proper prefixes. The lemma holds vacuously.\n    *   **Inductive Step (Unary):** Assume the lemma holds for a formula $\\psi \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$. Let $\\varphi = \\neg \\psi$, so $P(\\varphi) = \\neg P(\\psi)$. A proper prefix of $P(\\varphi)$ is either $u = \\neg$ or a string $u = \\neg v$ where $v$ is a proper prefix of $P(\\psi)$.\n        *   If $u = \\neg$, its balance is $\\beta(\\neg) = \\mathrm{ar}(\\neg) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$. This is non-negative.\n        *   If $u = \\neg v$, its balance is $\\beta(u) = \\beta(\\neg) + \\beta(v) = 0 + \\beta(v)$. By the inductive hypothesis on $\\psi$, since $v$ is a proper prefix of $P(\\psi)$, $\\beta(v) \\ge 0$. Thus, $\\beta(u) \\ge 0$.\n    *   **Inductive Step (Binary):** Assume the lemma holds for formulas $\\psi, \\chi \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$. Let $\\varphi = (\\psi \\circ \\chi)$, so $P(\\varphi) = \\circ P(\\psi) P(\\chi)$. A proper prefix $u$ of $P(\\varphi)$ can have one of the following forms:\n        1.  $u = \\circ$. Balance: $\\beta(\\circ) = \\mathrm{ar}(\\circ) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \\ge 0$.\n        2.  $u = \\circ v$, where $v$ is a proper prefix of $P(\\psi)$. Balance: $\\beta(u) = \\beta(\\circ) + \\beta(v) = 1 + \\beta(v)$. By the inductive hypothesis on $\\psi$, $\\beta(v) \\ge 0$, so $\\beta(u) \\ge 1 > 0$.\n        3.  $u = \\circ P(\\psi)$. Balance: $\\beta(u) = \\beta(\\circ) + \\beta(P(\\psi)) = 1 + (-1) = 0$, using Lemma 1 for $P(\\psi)$. This is non-negative.\n        4.  $u = \\circ P(\\psi) w$, where $w$ is a proper prefix of $P(\\chi)$. Balance: $\\beta(u) = \\beta(\\circ) + \\beta(P(\\psi)) + \\beta(w) = 1 + (-1) + \\beta(w) = \\beta(w)$. By the inductive hypothesis on $\\chi$, $\\beta(w) \\ge 0$, so $\\beta(u) \\ge 0$.\n\nIn all cases, the balance of a proper prefix is non-negative. By the principle of structural induction, Lemma 2 holds for all $\\varphi \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$.\n\n**Main Proof:**\nNow we can prove that $P[\\mathsf{Fm}]$ is prefix-free. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exist two distinct formulas $\\varphi_1, \\varphi_2 \\in \\mathsf{Fm}$ such that $u = P(\\varphi_1)$ is a proper prefix of $v = P(\\varphi_2)$.\n*   Since $u = P(\\varphi_1)$ is a formula translation from $P[\\mathsf{Fm}]$, by Lemma 1, its balance is $\\beta(u) = -1$.\n*   Since $u$ is a proper prefix of $v = P(\\varphi_2)$ (and $v$ is in $P[\\mathsf{Fm}]$), by Lemma 2, its balance must be non-negative: $\\beta(u) \\ge 0$.\nWe have arrived at the contradiction $-1 \\ge 0$. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false. No string in $P[\\mathsf{Fm}]$ can be a proper prefix of another string in $P[\\mathsf{Fm}]$. The set $P[\\mathsf{Fm}]$ is prefix-free.\n\n### Part 3: Computation of Token Length\n\nWe need to compute the token length of $P(F)$, where\n$$ F \\;:=\\; \\bigl((\\neg p \\lor (q \\to r)) \\land (\\neg(s \\land t) \\to (p \\lor \\neg q))\\bigr) \\to \\bigl(r \\lor (\\neg p \\land (q \\to (s \\lor t)))\\bigr) $$\nThe length of a string $P(\\varphi)$, denoted $|P(\\varphi)|$, is the number of symbols from $\\Sigma$ in it. We can define a function $L(\\varphi) = |P(\\varphi)|$ by structural recursion:\n*   $L(p) = 1$ for $p \\in \\mathsf{Var}$.\n*   $L(\\neg \\psi) = 1 + L(\\psi)$.\n*   $L((\\psi \\circ \\chi)) = 1 + L(\\psi) + L(\\chi)$.\n\nThis recursive definition shows that $L(\\varphi)$ is simply the total count of symbols (propositional variables and connectives) in the formula $\\varphi$. We can therefore find $|P(F)|$ by counting all such symbols in the expression for $F$.\n\nLet's count the connectives in $F$:\n*   The main connective is $\\to$: $1$.\n*   In the antecedent $\\bigl((\\neg p \\lor (q \\to r)) \\land (\\neg(s \\land t) \\to (p \\lor \\neg q))\\bigr)$:\n    *   The primary connective is $\\land$: $1$.\n    *   In its left subformula $(\\neg p \\lor (q \\to r))$: $\\lor, \\neg, \\to$ ($3$ connectives).\n    *   In its right subformula $(\\neg(s \\land t) \\to (p \\lor \\neg q))$: $\\to, \\neg, \\land, \\lor, \\neg$ ($5$ connectives).\n*   In the consequent $\\bigl(r \\lor (\\neg p \\land (q \\to (s \\lor t)))\\bigr)$:\n    *   The primary connective is $\\lor$: $1$.\n    *   In its right subformula $(\\neg p \\land (q \\to (s \\lor t)))$: $\\land, \\neg, \\to, \\lor$ ($4$ connectives).\n\nTotal number of connectives: $1 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 15$.\n\nNow let's count the occurrences of propositional variables in $F$:\n*   In the antecedent $\\bigl((\\neg p \\lor (q \\to r)) \\land (\\neg(s \\land t) \\to (p \\lor \\neg q))\\bigr)$:\n    *   In $(\\neg p \\lor (q \\to r))$: $p, q, r$ ($3$ variables).\n    *   In $(\\neg(s \\land t) \\to (p \\lor \\neg q))$: $s, t, p, q$ ($4$ variables).\n*   In the consequent $\\bigl(r \\lor (\\neg p \\land (q \\to (s \\lor t)))\\bigr)$:\n    *   The variable $r$ on the left of $\\lor$: $1$ variable.\n    *   In $(\\neg p \\land (q \\to (s \\lor t)))$: $p, q, s, t$ ($4$ variables).\n\nTotal number of variable occurrences: $3 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 12$.\n\nThe total token length of $P(F)$ is the sum of the number of connectives and the number of variable occurrences.\n$$ |P(F)| = (\\text{count of connectives}) + (\\text{count of variables}) = 15 + 12 = 27 $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{27}\n$$", "id": "2986347"}, {"introduction": "Although the language of propositional logic allows for the construction of infinitely many distinct formulas, the number of unique meanings they can express is finite for a given set of variables.

Since there are $n$ variables and each can be assigned one of two values, the total number of distinct valuations is $2^n$. Let $\\mathcal{V}$ denote the set of all possible valuations; its cardinality is $|\\mathcal{V}| = 2^n$.\n\nThe semantic meaning of any formula $\\varphi$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}$ is entirely determined by its truth value under every possible valuation. We can represent this semantic content by a truth function, $f_\\varphi: \\mathcal{V} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$, defined as $f_\\varphi(v) = v(\\varphi)$ for every valuation $v \\in \\mathcal{V}$. This function maps each possible assignment of truth values to the variables to the resulting truth value of the formula $\\varphi$.\n\nThe problem defines semantic equivalence, $\\varphi \\equiv \\psi$, as the condition that for every valuation $v$, $v(\\varphi) = v(\\psi)$. In terms of truth functions, this is equivalent to the condition that $f_\\varphi(v) = f_\\psi(v)$ for all $v \\in \\mathcal{V}$. This means that two formulas are semantically equivalent if and only if they define the exact same truth function:\n$$ \\varphi \\equiv \\psi \\iff f_\\varphi = f_\\psi $$\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of semantic equivalence classes of formulas and the set of realizable truth functions. An equivalence class $[\\varphi]_{\\equiv}$ is mapped to the unique truth function $f_\\varphi$.\n\nFirst, we prove that the number of equivalence classes is finite.\nThe number of equivalence classes is equal to the number of distinct truth functions that can be represented by formulas in $\\mathcal{L}$. The set of all possible truth functions is the set of all functions from $\\mathcal{V}$ to $\\{0, 1\\}$. The domain of these functions is $\\mathcal{V}$, with size $|\\mathcal{V}| = 2^n$. The codomain is $\\{0, 1\\}$, with size $2$.\nThe total number of distinct functions from a set of size $A$ to a set of size $B$ is $B^A$. In our case, the total number of possible truth functions is $2^{|\\mathcal{V}|} = 2^{(2^n)}$.\nSince any formula corresponds to one of these truth functions, the number of distinct equivalence classes cannot exceed the total number of possible truth functions. As $n$ is a finite integer ($n \\geq 1$), $2^n$ is a finite integer, and $2^{(2^n)}$ is also a finite integer. This proves that the number of semantic equivalence classes is finite.\n\nNext, we compute the exact number of these equivalence classes.\nWe have shown that there are $2^{(2^n)}$ possible truth functions. To show that the number of equivalence classes is exactly this number, we must demonstrate that every possible truth function $f: \\mathcal{V} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ can be represented by some formula $\\varphi$ in the language $\\mathcal{L}$. That is, for every function $f$, there exists a formula $\\varphi$ such that $f_\\varphi = f$. This is the property of functional completeness of the set of connectives $\\{\\neg, \\land, \\lor\\}$.\n\nWe can prove this constructively by showing that any truth function can be expressed in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), which uses only the connectives $\\neg$, $\\land$, and $\\lor$.\nLet $f: \\mathcal{V} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ be an arbitrary truth function.\n\nCase 1: The function $f$ is the constant zero function, i.e., $f(v) = 0$ for all $v \\in \\mathcal{V}$.\nThis function is realized by any contradiction. Since $n \\geq 1$, there exists at least one variable $p_1 \\in X$. The formula $\\varphi = p_1 \\land \\neg p_1$ is a contradiction, so $v(\\varphi) = 0$ for all valuations $v$. Thus, $f_\\varphi = f$.\n\nCase 2: The function $f$ is not the constant zero function.\nThis means there is at least one valuation for which $f$ evaluates to $1$. Let $\\mathcal{V}_1 = \\{v \\in \\mathcal{V} \\mid f(v) = 1\\}$. This set is non-empty.\nFor each valuation $v_j \\in \\mathcal{V}_1$, we can construct a formula, called a minterm, $\\chi_j$, that is true if and only if the variables are assigned truth values according to $v_j$. The minterm $\\chi_j$ is a conjunction of literals (a variable or its negation):\n$$ \\chi_j = L_1 \\land L_2 \\land \\dots \\land L_n $$\nwhere for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the literal $L_i$ is $p_i$ if $v_j(p_i) = 1$, and $L_i$ is $\\neg p_i$ if $v_j(p_i) = 0$. By construction, for any valuation $v_k \\in \\mathcal{V}$, $v_k(\\chi_j) = 1$ if and only if $v_k = v_j$.\n\nNow, we can construct a formula $\\varphi_f$ that realizes the function $f$ by taking the disjunction of all the minterms corresponding to the valuations in $\\mathcal{V}_1$:\n$$ \\varphi_f = \\bigvee_{v_j \\in \\mathcal{V}_1} \\chi_j $$\nFor any valuation $v_k \\in \\mathcal{V}$, the value $v_k(\\varphi_f)$ is $1$ if and only if $v_k$ makes at least one of the disjuncts $\\chi_j$ true. This happens if and only if there exists a $v_j \\in \\mathcal{V}_1$ such that $v_k(\\chi_j) = 1$. As established, this is true if and only if $v_k = v_j$ for some $v_j \\in \\mathcal{V}_1$. In other words, $v_k(\\varphi_f) = 1$ if and only if $v_k \\in \\mathcal{V}_1$. By definition of $\\mathcal{V}_1$, this is equivalent to $f(v_k) = 1$. Therefore, $v_k(\\varphi_f) = f(v_k)$ for all $v_k \\in \\mathcal{V}$.\n\nSince the DNF construction uses only the connectives $\\neg$, $\\land$, and $\\lor$, which are available in $\\mathcal{L}$, we have shown that every truth function $f: \\mathcal{V} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ is realizable by a formula in $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\nThis establishes a bijection (a one-to-one and onto correspondence) between the set of semantic equivalence classes and the set of all possible truth functions on $n$ variables. The number of equivalence classes is therefore equal to the total number of truth functions.\n\nAs calculated previously, the number of distinct truth functions from a domain of size $2^n$ to a codomain of size $2$ is $2^{(2^n)}$.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of equivalence classes is $2^{(2^n)}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2^{2^n}}\n$$", "id": "2986358"}, {"introduction": "One of the most fundamental questions in logic is whether a conclusion $\\varphi$ is a necessary consequence of a set of premises $\\Gamma$.

For this biconditional to be true, $u$ and $p$ must have the same truth value:\n$$v(u) = v(p)$$\n\nFrom $\\gamma_5 \\in \\Gamma$, which is $t \\leftrightarrow (p \\land \\neg q)$:\nSubstituting $v(q) = F$, we have $v(\\neg q) = T$. The formula becomes $t \\leftrightarrow (p \\land T)$, which simplifies to $t \\leftrightarrow p$. For this to be true, $t$ and $p$ must have the same truth value:\n$$v(t) = v(p)$$\n\nAt this stage, we have determined that for any countermodel $v$:\n- $v(s) = F$\n- $v(q) = F$\n- $v(u) = v(p)$\n- $v(t) = v(p)$\n\nThe truth values of $q, s, t, u$ are fully determined by the value of $p$. The variables that remain to be determined are $p, r, w$. We now analyze the remaining constraints on these variables.\n\nThe remaining formulas from $\\Gamma$ are $\\gamma_1 = p \\to (q \\lor r)$ and $\\gamma_6 = w \\to (u \\land t)$. The remaining condition is $v(t \\land w) = F$.\n\nLet's simplify these three constraints using our findings:\n- For $\\gamma_1 = p \\to (q \\lor r)$: Substituting $v(q)=F$, this becomes $p \\to (F \\lor r)$, which is equivalent to $p \\to r$. So, we must have $v(p \\to r) = T$.\n- For $\\gamma_6 = w \\to (u \\land t)$: Substituting $v(u)=v(p)$ and $v(t)=v(p)$, this becomes $w \\to (p \\land p)$, which is equivalent to $w \\to p$. So, we must have $v(w \\to p) = T$.\n- For the condition $v(t \\land w) = F$: Substituting $v(t) = v(p)$, this becomes $v(p \\land w) = F$. This is equivalent to $v(\\neg(p \\land w)) = T$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of assignments for $(p, r, w)$ that satisfy the following three conditions simultaneously:\n(A) $p \\to r$ must be true.\n(B) $w \\to p$ must be true.\n(C) $\\neg(p \\land w)$ must be true.\n\nWe can analyze this by cases based on the possible truth values of the independent variable $p$.\n\nCase 1: $v(p) = T$.\n- Condition (A) $T \\to r$ is true only if $v(r)=T$.\n- Condition (B) $w \\to T$ is always true, so it places no constraint on $w$.\n- Condition (C) $\\neg(T \\land w)$ is true only if $T \\land w$ is false, which means $v(w)=F$.\nCombining these, if $v(p)=T$, then we must have $v(r)=T$ and $v(w)=F$. This yields one solution for $(p,r,w)$: $(T, T, F)$.\n\nThis provides an explicit countermodel, answering the first part of the problem.\nLet's construct this assignment $v_1$:\n- $v_1(p) = T$\n- $v_1(r) = T$\n- $v_1(w) = F$\n- From our derived dependencies:\n  - $v_1(s) = F$\n  - $v_1(q) = F$\n  - $v_1(u) = v_1(p) = T$\n  - $v_1(t) = v_1(p) = T$\nSo, the explicit countermodel is $v_1$ where $(p,q,r,s,t,u,w)$ is assigned $(T,F,T,F,T,T,F)$. A check verifies this assignment: all formulas in $\\Gamma$ are true, and $\\varphi = s \\lor (t \\land w)$ evaluates to $F \\lor (T \\land F) = F$. Thus, $\\Gamma \\not\\models \\varphi$.\n\nCase 2: $v(p) = F$.\n- Condition (A) $F \\to r$ is always true, so it places no constraint on $r$. $v(r)$ can be $T$ or $F$.\n- Condition (B) $w \\to F$ is true only if $v(w)=F$.\n- Condition (C) $\\neg(F \\land w)$ is always true, so it places no constraint on $w$.\nCombining these, if $v(p)=F$, then we must have $v(w)=F$, and $v(r)$ can be either $T$ or $F$. This yields two solutions for $(p,r,w)$: $(F, T, F)$ and $(F, F, F)$.\n\nThese two cases give rise to two more countermodels:\n- For $(p,r,w) = (F,T,F)$: The assignment is $(p,q,r,s,t,u,w) = (F,F,T,F,F,F,F)$.\n- For $(p,r,w) = (F,F,F)$: The assignment is $(p,q,r,s,t,u,w) = (F,F,F,F,F,F,F)$.\n\nTo answer the third part of the problem, we sum the number of solutions from all cases.\n- Case 1 ($v(p)=T$) gives $1$ valid assignment for $(p,r,w)$.\n- Case 2 ($v(p)=F$) gives $2$ valid assignments for $(p,r,w)$.\n\nThe total number of distinct countermodels is the sum of the number of solutions from these mutually exclusive cases, which is $1 + 2 = 3$. Each of these $3$ assignments for the independent variables $(p,r,w)$ determines a unique, complete assignment for all $7$ variables that satisfies all formulas in $\\Gamma$ and falsifies $\\varphi$. Therefore, there are exactly $3$ such countermodels.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "2986350"}]}
