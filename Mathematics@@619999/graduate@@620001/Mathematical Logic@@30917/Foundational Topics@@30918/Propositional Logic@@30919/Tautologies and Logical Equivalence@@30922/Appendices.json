It is a well-posed, objective, and scientifically grounded problem within the domain of classical propositional logic. It is self-contained, consistent, and requires a rigorous application of fundamental principles, namely the truth-table semantics of logical connectives, to arrive at a verifiable solution.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis of the formula $F = \\big((p\\lor q)\\to r\\big)\\leftrightarrow\\big((p\\to r)\\land(q\\to r)\\big)$.\nFirst, we determine the total number of valuations needed for an exhaustive test. The formula $F$ contains three distinct propositional variables: $p$, $q$, and $r$. A valuation assigns one of two possible truth values, denoted by $0$ (false) and $1$ (true), to each variable. The total number of unique valuations is therefore $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of variables. In this case, $n=3$, so the total number of valuations required to exhaustively test $F$ is $2^3 = 8$.\n\nSecond, we determine the fraction of these valuations for which $F$ evaluates to $1$. To do this, we construct a truth table that evaluates $F$ for each of the $8$ possible valuations of $\\{p, q, r\\}$. We will build the table by evaluating the sub-formulas of $F$. Let the left-hand side of the biconditional be $LHS = (p\\lor q)\\to r$ and the right-hand side be $RHS = (p\\to r)\\land(q\\to r)$. The full formula is $F = LHS \\leftrightarrow RHS$.\n\nThe truth-table semantics for the connectives are as follows, where $X$ and $Y$ are propositional formulas:\n-   $X \\lor Y$ is $1$ if at least one of $X$ or $Y$ is $1$; it is $0$ otherwise.\n-   $X \\land Y$ is $1$ if and only if both $X$ and $Y$ are $1$; it is $0$ otherwise.\n-   $X \\to Y$ is $0$ if and only if $X=1$ and $Y=0$; it is $1$ otherwise.\n-   $X \\leftrightarrow Y$ is $1$ if and only if $X$ and $Y$ have the same truth value ($X=Y$); it is $0$ otherwise.\n\nWe now construct the full truth table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c||c|c|c|c|c||c|}\n\\hline\np  q  r  p \\lor q  (p \\lor q) \\to r  p \\to r  q \\to r  (p \\to r) \\land (q \\to r)  F \\\\\n    (LHS)    (RHS)  (LHS \\leftrightarrow RHS) \\\\\n\\hline\n1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n1  1  0  1  0  0  0  0  1 \\\\\n1  0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n1  0  0  1  0  0  1  0  1 \\\\\n0  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  1  0  1  0  1  0  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  1  0  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  1  1  1  1  1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe final column of the truth table, which represents the truth value of the formula $F$ for each valuation, contains only the value $1$. This demonstrates that the formula $F$ is a tautology. It evaluates to $1$ under every possible valuation.\n\nThe number of valuations under which $F$ evaluates to $1$ is $8$. The total number of valuations is $8$. The fraction of valuations under which $F$ evaluates to $1$ is therefore $\\frac{8}{8} = 1$. In its simplest exact form, this fraction is $1$.\n\nThe two quantities requested are:\n1.  The fraction of valuations under which $F$ evaluates to $1$: $1$.\n2.

This involves finding the set of valuations for which the formula is false, determining if it is a tautology, and calculating the probability of it being false under a uniform distribution of valuations.\n\nFirst, we perform a validation of the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Propositional variables: $p, q, r$.\n- Valuation: A function $v:\\{p, q, r\\}\\to\\{0, 1\\}$.\n- Truth-functional semantics:\n    - $v(\\neg A)=1$ iff $v(A)=0$.\n    - $v(A\\land B)=1$ iff $v(A)=1$ and $v(B)=1$.\n    - $v(A\\lor B)=1$ iff $v(A)=1$ or $v(B)=1$.\n    - $v(A\\to B)=1$ iff $v(A)=0$ or $v(B)=1$.

The final answer must be a simplified fraction.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- The problem is **scientifically grounded** in classical propositional logic, a fundamental area of mathematical logic. All definitions are standard and correct.\n- The problem is **well-posed**. It asks for a specific set of valuations and a probability, both of which can be uniquely determined from the provided information.\n- The problem is **objective**, stated in formal mathematical language without ambiguity or opinion.\n- The problem is **self-contained and consistent**. All necessary logical definitions are provided.\n- The problem does not violate any other validation criteria. It is a standard exercise in logical analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe formula is an implication of the form $A \\to B$, where the antecedent is $A = (p\\lor q)\\land(\\neg p\\lor r)$ and the consequent is $B = (q\\lor r)$.\nWe want to find the set of valuations $v$ for which $v(F) = 0$. Based on the definition of the material conditional, a formula $A \\to B$ is false if and only if the antecedent $A$ is true and the consequent $B$ is false.\nTherefore, we are looking for valuations $v$ such that:\n$1.$ $v((p\\lor q)\\land(\\neg p\\lor r)) = 1$\n$2.$ $v(q\\lor r) = 0$\n\nLet's analyze the second condition first, as it is simpler. For a disjunction to be false, both of its disjuncts must be false.\nFrom $v(q\\lor r) = 0$, we must have:\n$v(q) = 0$ and $v(r) = 0$.\n\nNow, let's use these necessary conditions in the first main condition, $v((p\\lor q)\\land(\\neg p\\lor r)) = 1$. For a conjunction to be true, both of its conjuncts must be true. This gives us two sub-conditions:\n$2a.$ $v(p\\lor q) = 1$\n$2b.$ $v(\\neg p\\lor r) = 1$\n\nWe substitute the values we found for $v(q)$ and $v(r)$ into these sub-conditions.\n\nFor sub-condition $2a$:\n$v(p\\lor q) = 1$\nSubstituting $v(q)=0$, we get $v(p\\lor 0) = 1$.\nFor this disjunction to be true, at least one disjunct must be true. Since the second disjunct is $0$, the first must be $1$.\nThus, we must have $v(p) = 1$.\n\nFor sub-condition $2b$:\n$v(\\neg p\\lor r) = 1$\nSubstituting $v(r)=0$, we get $v(\\neg p\\lor 0) = 1$.\nSimilarly, for this disjunction to be true, we must have $v(\\neg p) = 1$.\nBy the definition of negation, if $v(\\neg p) = 1$, then $v(p) = 0$.\n\nSo, for the formula $F$ to be false, the valuation $v$ must satisfy the following simultaneously:\n- $v(q) = 0$\n- $v(r) = 0$\n- $v(p) = 1$ (from condition $2a$)\n- $v(p) = 0$ (from condition $2b$)\n\nThe requirement that $v(p)=1$ and $v(p)=0$ is a contradiction. A propositional variable cannot be assigned both true and false under the same valuation. Therefore, there exists no valuation $v$ that can satisfy all the necessary conditions for $v(F)=0$. The set of valuations for which $v(F)=0$ is the empty set.\n\nBased on this derivation, we can decide whether $F$ is a tautology. A formula is a tautology if it evaluates to $1$ for every possible valuation. Since there are no valuations for which $F$ evaluates to $0$, and a valuation must map any formula to either $0$ or $1$, it must be the case that $F$ evaluates to $1$ for all valuations. Thus, $F$ is a tautology. This logical structure is known as the resolution rule in logic.\n\nFinally, we compute the probability that $F$ is false. There are three propositional variables, $p$, $q$, and $r$, each of which can take one of two values ($0$ or $1$). The total number of distinct valuations is $2^3 = 8$. The problem states that these valuations are under a uniform distribution.\n\nThe probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. In this case, the event is \"$F$ is false\", which corresponds to a valuation $v$ making $v(F)=0$.\nLet $S$ be the set of all $8$ valuations. Let $E$ be the event that $F$ is false. The number of outcomes in $E$ is the number of valuations $v$ such that $v(F)=0$.\nAs we have shown, there are no such valuations. So, the size of the set of favorable outcomes is $|E|=0$.\nThe total number of outcomes is $|S|=8$.\nThe probability of $E$ is given by $P(E) = \\frac{|E|}{|S|}$.\n$P(F \\text{ is false}) = \\frac{0}{8} = 0$.\n\nThe final answer is required as a simplified fraction. The simplified fraction for $0$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2984335"}, {"introduction": "The choice of a proof method is not merely a matter of style; it has profound implications for computational efficiency.

We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the evaluation of a limit $L$ that compares the asymptotic costs of two proof methods—truth tables and semantic tableaux—for a specific family of tautological formulas $\\{F_n\\}_{n \\geq 1}$. The derivation requires finding closed-form expressions for the cost measures $T_n$ and $A_n$.\n\nFirst, we determine the cost $T_n$ of the truth-table method. The formula $F_n$ is constructed using $n$ distinct propositional variables, $\\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n\\}$. A valuation is a function that assigns a truth value (True or False) to each of these variables. Since each of the $n$ variables can independently take one of two truth values, the total number of distinct valuations is $2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2$ ($n$ times), which is $2^n$. The truth-table method for checking if a formula is a tautology requires evaluating the formula for every possible valuation of its variables. Thus, we must examine all $2^n$ valuations.\nThe number of rows in the truth table, which corresponds to the number of valuations to check, is therefore:\n$$\nT_n = 2^n\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the cost $A_n$ of the analytic tableau method. This cost is defined as the minimal number of rule applications required to close a semantic tableau for the negation of the formula, $\\lnot F_n$. We begin by analyzing the structure of $\\lnot F_n$.\nThe formula $F_n$ is defined by the recurrence:\n$$\nF_1 := p_1 \\lor \\lnot p_1, \\quad F_k := F_{k-1} \\land (p_k \\lor \\lnot p_k) \\text{ for } k \\geq 2\n$$\nThe negation of $F_n$ for $n \\geq 2$ is:\n$$\n\\lnot F_n = \\lnot \\left(F_{n-1} \\land (p_n \\lor \\lnot p_n)\\right)\n$$\nThe main connective is a negated conjunction, which corresponds to a $\\beta$-rule in the tableau method. Applying this rule expands the tableau into two branches. This constitutes one rule application.\nThe root of the tableau for $\\lnot F_n$ is expanded as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\lnot (F_{n-1} \\land (p_n \\lor \\lnot p_n)) \\\\\n\\downarrow \\\\\n\\begin{array}{c|c}\n\\lnot F_{n-1}  \\lnot (p_n \\lor \\lnot p_n) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{array}\n$$\nLet's analyze the right branch, which contains the formula $\\lnot(p_n \\lor \\lnot p_n)$. This is a negated disjunction, which is an $\\alpha$-rule. Applying this rule adds two formulas, $\\lnot p_n$ and $\\lnot\\lnot p_n$, to the branch. The formula $\\lnot\\lnot p_n$ is equivalent to $p_n$. The branch now contains both $p_n$ and $\\lnot p_n$, which is a contradiction, so this branch closes. The closure of this right branch requires exactly one $\\alpha$-rule application.\n\nThe left branch contains the formula $\\lnot F_{n-1}$. To close this branch, we must construct a tableau for $\\lnot F_{n-1}$. The number of rule applications required to do this is, by definition, $A_{n-1}$.\nThe total number of rule applications, $A_n$, is the sum of the initial $\\beta$-rule application, the applications needed for the left branch ($A_{n-1}$), and the applications needed for the right branch ($1$). This gives the recurrence relation for $n \\geq 2$:\n$$\nA_n = 1 + A_{n-1} + 1 = A_{n-1} + 2\n$$\nTo find a closed-form solution, we need a base case. For $n=1$, the formula is $\\lnot F_1 = \\lnot(p_1 \\lor \\lnot p_1)$. This is a single $\\alpha$-node. Its expansion requires one $\\alpha$-rule application, which adds $\\lnot p_1$ and $\\lnot\\lnot p_1$ (i.e., $p_1$) to the tableau, causing it to close. Therefore, the base case is:\n$$\nA_1 = 1\n$$\nThe recurrence relation $A_n = A_{n-1} + 2$ with the initial condition $A_1 = 1$ describes an arithmetic progression. The closed-form expression for $A_n$ is:\n$$\nA_n = A_1 + (n-1)d = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 2 = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n-1\n$$\nThe structure of the formula $\\lnot F_n$ is such that at each stage of decomposing $\\lnot F_k$, the only applicable rule is the $\\beta$-rule corresponding to the outermost negated conjunction. This means there is no alternative order of rule applications that could reduce the total count. Thus, $A_n = 2n-1$ is indeed the minimal number of rule applications.\n\nFinally, we compute the limit $L$:\n$$\nL := \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{T_n}{A_n}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $T_n$ and $A_n$:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{2^n}{2n-1}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}}\n$$\nWe can rewrite the expression as:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(2^n)^{\\frac{1}{n}}}{(2n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2}{(2n-1)^{\\frac{1}{n}}}\n$$\nThe limit of the numerator is trivially $2$.
