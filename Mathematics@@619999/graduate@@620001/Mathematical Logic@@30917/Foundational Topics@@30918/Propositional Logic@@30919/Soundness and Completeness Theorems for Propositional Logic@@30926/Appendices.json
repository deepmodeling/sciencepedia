We may proceed with the solution, addressing each of the three parts in sequence.\n\n## Part 1: Reduction to a Finite Truth Table\n\nThe first task is to prove that for a finite set of formulas $\\Gamma$, the semantic entailment $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$ can be decided by checking a finite truth table. This relies on the principle that the truth value of a formula depends only on the valuations of the propositional variables that appear within it. We first establish this principle formally.\n\nLet $\\psi$ be any formula in the language $\\mathcal{L}$. Let $\\mathsf{Var}(\\psi)$ be the set of propositional variables appearing in $\\psi$. We will prove by structural induction on $\\psi$ that for any two valuations $v_1:\\mathsf{Var}\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$ and $v_2:\\mathsf{Var}\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$, if $v_1$ and $v_2$ agree on all variables in $\\mathsf{Var}(\\psi)$ (i.e., $v_1(p) = v_2(p)$ for all $p\\in\\mathsf{Var}(\\psi)$), then $v_1\\models\\psi$ if and only if $v_2\\models\\psi$.\n\n**Base Case:** Let $\\psi$ be a propositional variable, $\\psi=p$, for some $p\\in\\mathsf{Var}$. Then $\\mathsf{Var}(\\psi) = \\{p\\}$. The definition of satisfaction states $v\\models p$ if and only if $v(p)=\\mathsf{T}$. If $v_1$ and $v_2$ agree on $\\mathsf{Var}(\\psi)$, then $v_1(p)=v_2(p)$. Thus, $v_1(p)=\\mathsf{T}$ if and only if $v_2(p)=\\mathsf{T}$, which means $v_1\\models p$ if and only if $v_2\\models p$. The claim holds for the base case.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume the claim holds for formulas $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. We must show it holds for $\\neg\\alpha$, $\\alpha\\land\\beta$, $\\alpha\\lor\\beta$, and $\\alpha\\to\\beta$. Let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be two valuations that agree on the variables of the new, composite formula.\n\n1.  **Negation ($\\neg\\alpha$):** The set of variables is $\\mathsf{Var}(\\neg\\alpha) = \\mathsf{Var}(\\alpha)$. Assume $v_1$ and $v_2$ agree on $\\mathsf{Var}(\\neg\\alpha)$. By the inductive hypothesis, since they agree on $\\mathsf{Var}(\\alpha)$, we have $v_1\\models\\alpha$ iff $v_2\\models\\alpha$. By definition, $v_1\\models\\neg\\alpha$ iff $v_1\\not\\models\\alpha$. This is equivalent to $v_2\\not\\models\\alpha$, which in turn is equivalent to $v_2\\models\\neg\\alpha$. Thus, $v_1\\models\\neg\\alpha$ iff $v_2\\models\\neg\\alpha$.\n\n2.  **Conjunction ($\\alpha\\land\\beta$):** The set of variables is $\\mathsf{Var}(\\alpha\\land\\beta) = \\mathsf{Var}(\\alpha)\\cup\\mathsf{Var}(\\beta)$. Assume $v_1$ and $v_2$ agree on $\\mathsf{Var}(\\alpha\\land\\beta)$. This implies they agree on $\\mathsf{Var}(\\alpha)$ and also on $\\mathsf{Var}(\\beta)$. By the inductive hypothesis, $v_1\\models\\alpha$ iff $v_2\\models\\alpha$, and $v_1\\models\\beta$ iff $v_2\\models\\beta$. By definition, $v_1\\models\\alpha\\land\\beta$ iff ($v_1\\models\\alpha$ and $v_1\\models\\beta$). This is equivalent to ($v_2\\models\\alpha$ and $v_2\\models\\beta$), which is precisely the condition for $v_2\\models\\alpha\\land\\beta$. Thus, $v_1\\models\\alpha\\land\\beta$ iff $v_2\\models\\alpha\\land\\beta$.\n\nThe proofs for $\\alpha\\lor\\beta$ and $\\alpha\\to\\beta$ are analogous, relying on their respective definitions and the inductive hypothesis applied to $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. This completes the induction. We have established that for any formula $\\psi$, its truth value under a valuation $v$ is fully determined by the restriction of $v$ to the variables in $\\psi$, denoted $v\\!\\upharpoonright\\!\\mathsf{Var}(\\psi)$.\n\nNow, let $X = \\mathsf{Var}(\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\varphi\\})$. Since $\\Gamma$ is a finite set of formulas and each formula has a finite number of variables, $X$ is a finite set. Let $|X|=n$.\nFor any formula $\\psi \\in \\Gamma\\cup\\{\\varphi\\}$, we have $\\mathsf{Var}(\\psi)\\subseteq X$. By the principle we just proved, the truth value of $\\psi$ under a valuation $v$ depends only on the values $v$ assigns to the variables in $X$, i.e., on $v\\!\\upharpoonright\\!X$.\n\nWe now prove that $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$ if and only if for every valuation $w:X\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$, if $w\\models\\Gamma$ then $w\\models\\varphi$.\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$. This means for any valuation $v:\\mathsf{Var}\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$, if $v\\models\\Gamma$ then $v\\models\\varphi$. Let $w:X\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$ be an arbitrary valuation on the finite set of variables $X$. We can extend $w$ to a valuation $v_w:\\mathsf{Var}\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$ by setting $v_w(p) = w(p)$ for $p\\in X$ and, for instance, $v_w(p)=\\mathsf{F}$ for all $p\\notin X$. For any formula $\\psi\\in\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\varphi\\}$, its truth value under $v_w$ depends only on the assignments to variables in $X$, so $v_w\\models\\psi$ if and only if $w\\models\\psi$. Now, suppose $w\\models\\Gamma$. This implies $v_w\\models\\Gamma$. By our initial assumption ($\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$), this forces $v_w\\models\\varphi$. This, in turn, implies $w\\models\\varphi$. Since $w$ was an arbitrary valuation on $X$, the claim holds.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume that for every valuation $w:X\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$, if $w\\models\\Gamma$ then $w\\models\\varphi$. Let $v:\\mathsf{Var}\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$ be an arbitrary valuation. Let $w = v\\!\\upharpoonright\\!X$ be the restriction of $v$ to the variables in $X$. Suppose $v\\models\\Gamma$. For each $\\gamma\\in\\Gamma$, $v\\models\\gamma$. Since the truth of $\\gamma$ only depends on variables in $X$, this means $w\\models\\gamma$. Thus, $w\\models\\Gamma$. By our assumption, this implies $w\\models\\varphi$. Again, since the truth of $\\varphi$ depends only on variables in $X$, $w\\models\\varphi$ implies $v\\models\\varphi$. Since $v$ was an arbitrary valuation, we have shown that for any $v$, if $v\\models\\Gamma$ then $v\\models\\varphi$. This is the definition of $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$.\n\nThis establishes that checking $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$ is equivalent to checking all $2^{|X|}$ possible valuations on the finite set $X$. This is precisely what is done by constructing a truth table for the variables in $X$.\n\n## Part 2: Countermodel Count and Its Equivalence to Derivability\n\nThe countermodel count is defined as $C(\\Gamma,\\varphi) = \\left|\\left\\{\\,w:X\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}\\mid w\\models\\Gamma\\text{ and }w\\not\\models\\varphi\\,\\right\\}\\right|$, where $X=\\mathsf{Var}(\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\varphi\\})$. We need to prove $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$ if and only if $C(\\Gamma,\\varphi)=0$.\n\nA valuation $w:X\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$ is a countermodel for the entailment $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$ if it makes all formulas in $\\Gamma$ true, but makes $\\varphi$ false. That is, $w\\models\\Gamma$ and $w\\not\\models\\varphi$. The number $C(\\Gamma,\\varphi)$ is by its very definition the count of such countermodels over the relevant variables in $X$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we know that $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$ is equivalent to the statement: \"for every valuation $w:X\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$, if $w\\models\\Gamma$ then $w\\models\\varphi$\". This statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive form, or more directly, to the statement: \"there does not exist a valuation $w:X\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$ such that $w\\models\\Gamma$ and $w\\not\\models\\varphi$\".\n\nThe set whose cardinality is $C(\\Gamma,\\varphi)$ is precisely the set of these counterexample valuations. Therefore, the statement \"there does not exist a counterexample\" is equivalent to the statement that this set is empty, i.e., its cardinality is $0$.\nSo, we have the chain of equivalences:\n$$ (\\Gamma\\models\\varphi) \\iff (\\text{The set of countermodels is empty}) \\iff (C(\\Gamma,\\varphi) = 0) $$\nThis proves the desired equivalence.\n\nNow, we connect this to syntactic derivability using the Soundness and Completeness theorems. Let $\\vdash$ denote the syntactic derivability relation in a given sound and complete deductive system for propositional logic.\nThe **Soundness Theorem** states: If $\\Gamma\\vdash\\varphi$, then $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$. (Every provable statement is true).\nThe **Completeness Theorem** states: If $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi$, then $\\Gamma\\vdash\\varphi$. (Every true statement is provable).\n\nCombining these two theorems, we have the fundamental equivalence:\n$$ \\Gamma\\vdash\\varphi \\iff \\Gamma\\models\\varphi $$\nWe have already shown that $\\Gamma\\models\\varphi \\iff C(\\Gamma,\\varphi)=0$.\nBy transitivity of the biconditional, we can conclude:\n$$ \\Gamma\\vdash\\varphi \\iff C(\\Gamma,\\varphi)=0 $$\nThis means that the non-existence of a semantic countermodel (i.e., $C(\\Gamma,\\varphi)=0$) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a syntactic proof (a derivation) of $\\varphi$ from the premises $\\Gamma$ in any sound and complete deductive system.\n\n## Part 3: Computation of $C(\\{p\\to q,\\,p\\},\\,q)$\n\nWe need to compute the value of $C(\\Gamma,\\varphi)$ for $\\Gamma=\\{p\\to q, p\\}$ and $\\varphi=q$.\n\n1.  **Identify variables:** The set of relevant propositional variables is $X = \\mathsf{Var}(\\Gamma\\cup\\{\\varphi\\}) = \\mathsf{Var}(\\{p\\to q, p, q\\}) = \\{p, q\\}$.\n\n2.  **Identify valuations:** Since $|X|=2$, there are $2^2=4$ distinct valuations $w:\\{p, q\\}\\to\\{\\mathsf{T},\\mathsf{F}\\}$.\n\n3.  **Count countermodels:** We need to find the number of valuations $w$ that satisfy the condition ($w\\models\\Gamma$ and $w\\not\\models\\varphi$). This translates to:\n    $$(w\\models (p\\to q) \\text{ and } w\\models p) \\text{ and } w\\not\\models q$$\n    We construct a truth table to systematically check all $4$ valuations. We use $1$ for $\\mathsf{T}$ and $0$ for $\\mathsf{F}$. The definition of $p\\to q$ is $\\neg p \\lor q$.\n\n| $w(p)$ | $w(q)$ | $w\\models p$? | $w\\models q$? | $w\\models p\\to q$? | $w\\models\\Gamma$?

Here, $w\\models p$ and $w\\models q$. Since $w\\models q$, $w\\models p\\to q$ is true. So $w\\models\\Gamma$. However, $w\\models q$, so $w\\not\\models q$ is false. This is not a countermodel.\n-   **Row 2: $w(p)=\\mathsf{T}, w(q)=\\mathsf{F}$**. Here, $w\\models p$. But since $w\\not\\models q$, $w\\models p\\to q$ is false. Thus $w\\not\\models\\Gamma$. This is not a countermodel.\n-   **Row 3: $w(p)=\\mathsf{F}, w(q)=\\mathsf{T}$**. Here, $w\\not\\models p$. Thus $w\\not\\models\\Gamma$.

This is not a countermodel.\n\nThe final column, \"Countermodel?\", is false ($0$) for all four possible valuations. There are no valuations $w$ that satisfy the condition of being a countermodel. Therefore, the set of countermodels is empty.\n\nThe countermodel count is the cardinality of this empty set.\n$$ C(\\{p\\to q,\\,p\\},\\,q) = 0 $$\nThis result is expected, as $\\{p\\to q, p\\}\\models q$ corresponds to the valid rule of inference known as Modus Ponens.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2983070"}, {"introduction": "Shifting our focus from semantics to syntax, this exercise challenges you to engage directly with the mechanics of a formal deductive system.

It is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically grounded. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Construction of the derivation for $\\vdash A \\to A$**\n\nWe seek a sequence of well-formed formulas, where each formula is either an instance of an axiom schema or is derived from previous formulas in the sequence by an application of Modus Ponens. The final formula in the sequence must be $A \\to A$. Note that axiom schema (A3) is not required for this particular derivation.\n\nThe derivation is as follows:\n\n1.  $(A \\to ((A \\to A) \\to A)) \\to ((A \\to (A \\to A)) \\to (A \\to A))$\n    This is an instance of axiom schema (A2) obtained by the uniform substitution:\n    $\\varphi \\to A$\n    $\\psi \\to (A \\to A)$\n    $\\chi \\to A$\n\n2.  $A \\to ((A \\to A) \\to A)$\n    This is an instance of axiom schema (A1) obtained by the uniform substitution:\n    $\\varphi \\to A$\n    $\\psi \\to (A \\to A)$\n\n3.  $(A \\to (A \\to A)) \\to (A \\to A)$\n    This formula is derived by applying Modus Ponens to the formulas on lines 1 and 2. Line 2 is the antecedent of the implication on line 1. This is the first application of MP.\n\n4.  $A \\to (A \\to A)$\n    This is an instance of axiom schema (A1) obtained by the uniform substitution:\n    $\\varphi \\to A$\n    $\\psi \\to A$\n\n5.  $A \\to A$\n    This formula is derived by applying Modus Ponens to the formulas on lines 3 and 4. Line 4 is the antecedent of the implication on line 3. This is the second application of MP.\n\nThis completes the formal derivation of $\\vdash A \\to A$. This specific derivation requires exactly two applications of Modus Ponens.\n\n**Part 2: Justification of the minimal number of Modus Ponens applications**\n\nWe must now argue that two is the minimal number of MP applications required.\n\n**Case 0: Zero applications of MP**\nIf zero applications of MP were sufficient, then $A \\to A$ itself would have to be a direct instance of one of the axiom schemata.\n-   (A1) requires the form $\\varphi \\to (\\psi \\to \\varphi)$. The consequent, $\\psi \\to \\varphi$, is an implication. $A \\to A$ does not fit this structure, as its consequent, $A$, is atomic.\n-   (A2) has the form $(\\dots) \\to (\\dots)$. The entire formula is a complex implication whose antecedent is itself an implication. $A \\to A$ does not match this structure.\n-   (A3) has the form $(\\lnot\\varphi \\to \\lnot\\psi) \\to (\\psi \\to \\varphi)$. Again, the antecedent is an implication. $A \\to A$ does not match this structure.\nTherefore, $A \\to A$ is not an instance of any axiom schema, and the minimal number of MP applications must be greater than $0$.\n\n**Case 1: One application of MP**\nIf one application of MP were sufficient, there would have to exist two formulas, $P$ and $P \\to (A \\to A)$, both of which are direct instances of the axiom schemata. Let's analyze the required structure of the formula $P \\to (A \\to A)$.\n\n-   Can $P \\to (A \\to A)$ be an instance of (A1), i.e., of the form $\\varphi \\to (\\psi \\to \\varphi)$?\n    For this to be true, we must have $\\psi \\to \\varphi$ match $A \\to A$. This forces the substitution $\\psi=A$ and $\\varphi=A$. The instance of (A1) would then be $A \\to (A \\to A)$. In this case, the premise $P$ would be $A$. However, the formula $A$ (an atomic proposition) is not an instance of any axiom schema. Thus, this path is not possible.\n\n-   Can $P \\to (A \\to A)$ be an instance of (A2), i.e., of the form $(\\varphi \\to (\\psi \\to \\chi)) \\to ((\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to (\\varphi \\to \\chi))$?\n    For this to be true, the consequent $((\\varphi \\to \\psi) \\to (\\varphi \\to \\chi))$ must match $A \\to A$. This is a structural impossibility. The former is an implication whose antecedent is an implication, while the latter is a simple implication between atomic propositions. Thus, this path is not possible.\n\n-   Can $P \\to (A \\to A)$ be an instance of (A3), i.e., of the form $(\\lnot\\varphi \\to \\lnot\\psi) \\to (\\psi \\to \\varphi)$?\n    For this to be true, the consequent $\\psi \\to \\varphi$ must match $A \\to A$. This is possible with the substitution $\\psi=A$ and $\\varphi=A$. The resulting instance of (A3) would be $(\\lnot A \\to \\lnot A) \\to (A \\to A)$. This requires the premise $P$ to be $\\lnot A \\to \\lnot A$. We must then check if $\\lnot A \\to \\lnot A$ can be an instance of an axiom schema. As established in the analysis for Case 0, a formula of the form $X \\to X$ is not an instance of (A1), (A2), or (A3). Therefore, the premise $P$ cannot be an axiom. Thus, this path is also not possible.\n\nSince it is impossible to find two axioms $P$ and $P \\to (A \\to A)$, a derivation with a single application of MP is not possible. The minimal number of MP applications must be greater than $1$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have demonstrated that the number of MP applications must be strictly greater than $1$.

We now have both $M \\vdash D$ and $M \\vdash \\lnot D$. By the definition of consistency, this means $M$ is an inconsistent set. This contradicts the given fact that $M$ is a maximal *consistent* set. Therefore, our initial supposition that $D \\notin M$ must be false. Hence, $D \\in M$. This proves that $M$ is deductively closed. A direct consequence is that $M$ is closed under the rule of modus ponens: if $X \\in M$ and $X \\to Y \\in M$, then $Y \\in M$. This is because $\\{X, X \\to Y\\} \\vdash Y$, and since $X, X \\to Y \\in M$, we have $M \\vdash Y$, which implies $Y \\in M$. Also, all instances of the axiom schemata must be in $M$, since $\\vdash A_i$ for any axiom $A_i$, which implies $M \\vdash A_i$, and thus $A_i \\in M$.\n\nNow, we prove the **Truth Lemma**: For any formula $D$, $v_M(D)=1$ if and only if $D \\in M$.\nThe proof is by induction on the structure of the formula $D$.\n\n**Base Case:** $D$ is a propositional variable, say $p_i$.\nThe canonical valuation $v_M$ is defined on propositional variables such that $v_M(p_i)=1$ if $p_i \\in M$ and $v_M(p_i)=0$ if $\\lnot p_i \\in M$. Since $M$ is maximal consistent, for any variable $p_i$, exactly one of $p_i \\in M$ or $\\lnot p_i \\in M$ holds. Thus, $v_M(p_i)=1$ if and only if $p_i \\in M$. The base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume the lemma holds for formulas $X$ and $Y$. We show it holds for $\\lnot X$ and $X \\to Y$.\n\n**1. Formula of the form $\\lnot X$:**\nWe need to show $v_M(\\lnot X) = 1 \\iff \\lnot X \\in M$.\nBy the truth-functional definition of negation, $v_M(\\lnot X) = 1$ if and only if $v_M(X) = 0$.\nBy the inductive hypothesis for $X$, $v_M(X) = 0$ if and only if $X \\notin M$.\nBy the definition of a maximal consistent set, $X \\notin M$ if and only if $\\lnot X \\in M$.\nCombining these equivalences, we have $v_M(\\lnot X) = 1 \\iff \\lnot X \\in M$. The lemma holds for $\\lnot X$.\n\n**2. Formula of the form $X \\to Y$:**\nWe need to show $v_M(X \\to Y) = 1 \\iff X \\to Y \\in M$.\n\n($\\Rightarrow$) Assume $v_M(X \\to Y) = 1$. By the truth-functional definition of the material conditional, this means either $v_M(X)=0$ or $v_M(Y)=1$.\n- Case a: $v_M(X)=0$. By the inductive hypothesis, $X \\notin M$. By maximality, $\\lnot X \\in M$. This implies $M \\vdash \\lnot X$. We can show that in the given deductive system, $\\lnot X \\vdash X \\to Y$. The derivation is as follows:\n    1. $\\lnot X$ (Hypothesis, since $\\lnot X \\in M$)\n    2. $\\lnot X \\to (\\lnot Y \\to \\lnot X)$ (Axiom 1)\n    3. $\\lnot Y \\to \\lnot X$ (Modus Ponens on 1, 2)\n    4. $(\\lnot Y \\to \\lnot X) \\to (X \\to Y)$ (Axiom 3)\n    5. $X \\to Y$ (Modus Ponens on 3, 4)\nSince $M \\vdash \\lnot X$ and $\\lnot X \\vdash X \\to Y$, we have $M \\vdash X \\to Y$. Since $M$ is deductively closed, it follows that $X \\to Y \\in M$.\n- Case b: $v_M(Y)=1$. By the inductive hypothesis, $Y \\in M$. This implies $M \\vdash Y$. From Axiom 1, we have an instance $\\vdash Y \\to (X \\to Y)$. Since this is a theorem, $M \\vdash Y \\to (X \\to Y)$. Since $M \\vdash Y$, by modus ponens, we get $M \\vdash X \\to Y$. As $M$ is deductively closed, $X \\to Y \\in M$.\nIn both cases, we conclude $X \\to Y \\in M$.\n\n($\\Leftarrow$) Assume $X \\to Y \\in M$. We want to show $v_M(X \\to Y)=1$. We argue by contradiction. Suppose $v_M(X \\to Y)=0$. This would imply, by the semantics of $\\to$, that $v_M(X)=1$ and $v_M(Y)=0$.\nBy the inductive hypothesis:\n- $v_M(X)=1 \\implies X \\in M$.\n- $v_M(Y)=0 \\implies Y \\notin M$.\nSo we have $X \\in M$ and $X \\to Y \\in M$. Since $M$ is deductively closed (and thus closed under modus ponens), it must be that $Y \\in M$. This contradicts our finding that $Y \\notin M$. Therefore, the initial supposition that $v_M(X \\to Y)=0$ must be false. We conclude that $v_M(X \\to Y)=1$.\n\nThis completes the inductive step. The Truth Lemma is established.\n\nWe now apply this result to the specific problem.\n\n**1. Derivation of the truth value of $v_M(A)$:**\nWe are given that $M$ is a maximal consistent set containing $\\Gamma \\cup \\{\\lnot A\\}$. This means, by definition, that $\\lnot A \\in M$.\nAccording to the Truth Lemma we just proved, for any formula $D$, $D \\in M \\iff v_M(D)=1$.\nApplying this to the formula $\\lnot A$, we have:\n$\\lnot A \\in M \\iff v_M(\\lnot A)=1$.\nBy the standard truth-functional semantics for negation, $v_M(\\lnot A) = 1 - v_M(A)$.\nTherefore, we have the equation $1 - v_M(A) = 1$.\nSolving for $v_M(A)$, we find $v_M(A) = 0$.\n\n**2. Justification of $v_M$ as a countermodel:**\nA valuation is a countermodel to the sequent $\\Gamma \\vdash A$ if it demonstrates that the corresponding semantic entailment $\\Gamma \\models A$ does not hold. This requires a valuation $v$ such that $v(B)=1$ for all formulas $B \\in \\Gamma$, while $v(A)=0$. We will show that $v_M$ is exactly such a valuation.\n- We have already established that $v_M(A)=0$.\n- Now, consider any formula $B \\in \\Gamma$. The problem states that $\\Gamma \\subseteq M$. Therefore, for any $B \\in \\Gamma$, it is also true that $B \\in M$.\n- By the Truth Lemma, $B \\in M \\iff v_M(B)=1$.\n- Thus, for every formula $B \\in \\Gamma$, we have $v_M(B)=1$.\n\nThe valuation $v_M$ makes every formula in the set of premises $\\Gamma$ true, but makes the conclusion formula $A$ false. This is the definition of a countermodel for the semantic entailment $\\Gamma \\models A$. The existence of such a countermodel demonstrates that $\\Gamma \\not\\models A$. This construction is the core of the proof of the completeness theorem for propositional logic, which states that if $\\Gamma \\nvdash A$, then $\\Gamma \\not\\models A$.\n\nThe problem asks specifically for the value of $v_M(A)$, which we have derived to be $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2983024"}]}
