All necessary data and definitions for the construction of a semantic tableau and the calculation of its associated cost are provided.\n\nThe task is to construct a closed semantic tableau for the initial set of signed formulas $\\Gamma=\\{\\,T(A \\to B),\\,T A,\\,F B\\,\\}$, justify its closure based on the semantics of implication, and compute the minimal cost of this closure based on the provided cost functional.\n\nFirst, we construct the tableau. The tableau begins with a single root node containing all the formulas in the initial set $\\Gamma$.\n\n1.  Initial set: $\\{\\,T(A \\to B),\\,T A,\\,F B\\,\\}$\n\nThe only non-literal formula in this set is $T(A \\to B)$. We must apply the $T\\to$ rule to it. The problem states that the rule for $T(\\varphi \\to \\psi)$ is a branching rule that adds $F\\varphi$ to one branch and $T\\psi$ to the other. Applying this rule to $T(A \\to B)$ yields two branches. This action constitutes one application of the $T\\to$ rule, incurring a cost of $\\alpha$.\n\nThe structure of the tableau is as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n1.\\; T(A \\to B) \\\\\n2.\\; T A \\\\\n3.\\; F B \\\\\n\\swarrow \\quad \\searrow \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe left branch is formed by adding $F A$ to the initial set, and the right branch is formed by adding $T B$.\n\nLeft Branch:\nThe set of formulas on this branch is $\\{\\,T(A \\to B),\\,T A,\\,F B,\\,F A\\,\\}$. This branch contains the formula $T A$ (from line $2$) and the formula $F A$ (from the application of the $T\\to$ rule). This is a complementary pair of the form $\\{T\\chi, F\\chi\\}$ with $\\chi = A$. According to the closure condition, a branch containing such a pair is closed. The act of closing this branch incurs a cost of $\\beta$.\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\vdots \\\\\n4.\\; F A \\quad (\\text{from } 1) \\\\\n\\times \\quad (\\text{from } 2, 4) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nRight Branch:\nThe set of formulas on this branch is $\\{\\,T(A \\to B),\\,T A,\\,F B,\\,T B\\,\\}$. This branch contains the formula $F B$ (from line $3$) and the formula $T B$ (from the application of the $T\\to$ rule). This is a complementary pair of the form $\\{T\\chi, F\\chi\\}$ with $\\chi = B$. Therefore, this branch is also closed. The act of closing this second branch incurs another cost of $\\beta$.\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\vdots \\\\\n4.\\; T B \\quad (\\text{from } 1) \\\\\n\\times \\quad (\\text{from } 3, 4) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nSince every branch in the tableau is closed, the tableau itself is closed. This constitutes a proof that the initial set of formulas $\\Gamma$ is unsatisfiable.\n\nNext, we justify this result from the fundamental semantics. The tableau method is a systematic search for a satisfying valuation (a model). The initial set $\\Gamma = \\{\\,T(A \\to B),\\,T A,\\,F B\\,\\}$ represents the hypothesis that there exists a valuation $v$ such that $v(A \\to B) = T$, $v(A) = T$, and $v(B) = F$.\nThe semantic clause for implication states that $v(\\varphi \\to \\psi) = T$ if and only if $v(\\varphi) = F$ or $v(\\psi) = T$.\nApplying the $T\\to$ rule to $T(A \\to B)$ decomposes this hypothesis into two exhaustive cases, each represented by a branch:\n1.  Case 1 (Left Branch): We test the possibility that $v(A) = F$. The set of truth assignments we are testing on this branch is $\\{v(A \\to B) = T, v(A) = T, v(B) = F, v(A) = F\\}$. This set simultaneously requires $v(A)$ to be true (from $T A$) and false (from $F A$). This is a direct logical contradiction. The complementary pair $T A$ and $F A$ is the syntactic representation of this semantic contradiction. The closure of the branch signifies that this case is impossible.\n2.  Case 2 (Right Branch): We test the possibility that $v(B) = T$. The set of truth assignments we are testing on this branch is $\\{v(A \\to B) = T, v(A) = T, v(B) = F, v(B) = T\\}$. This set simultaneously requires $v(B)$ to be false (from $F B$) and true (from $T B$). This is also a direct logical contradiction, syntactically represented by the complementary pair $F B$ and $T B$. The closure of this branch signifies that this second case is also impossible.\n\nSince all possible cases that would satisfy the initial premises lead to a logical contradiction, no satisfying valuation exists. Therefore, the set $\\Gamma$ is unsatisfiable. The $T\\to$ rule, by correctly encoding the semantics of implication, combined with the closure rule for detecting contradictions, is sufficient to demonstrate this.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimal total cost. The cost functional $C$ is defined with $C(T\\to) = \\alpha$ and $C(\\mathrm{close}) = \\beta$.\nIn the construction of the tableau, the following actions were performed:\n- One application of the $T\\to$ rule on the formula $T(A \\to B)$.\n- Two acts of closing a branch: one for the left branch and one for the right branch.\n\nThe total cost is the sum of the costs of these actions.\nTotal Cost = ($1$ application of $T\\to$) + ($2$ applications of $\\mathrm{close}$)\nTotal Cost = $1 \\times C(T\\to) + 2 \\times C(\\mathrm{close})$\nTotal Cost = $1 \\cdot \\alpha + 2 \\cdot \\beta$\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimal* total cost. In this case, there is only one non-literal formula, $T(A \\to B)$, in the initial set. Thus, applying the $T\\to$ rule is the only possible first step to develop the tableau. The subsequent steps of closing the two resulting branches are then necessary. Therefore, this sequence of operations is the only one possible, and the calculated cost is necessarily minimal.\nThe minimal total cost is $\\alpha + 2\\beta$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\alpha + 2\\beta} $$", "id": "2979849"}, {"introduction": "The distinction between classical and intuitionistic logic is a cornerstone of modern proof theory, centering on the admissibility of non-constructive principles like the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM).

In particular, the rules include $\\to$-introduction and $\\to$-elimination (modus ponens), $\\lor$-introduction and $\\lor$-elimination, and Ex Falso Quodlibet (EFQ), which allows one to infer any formula $C$ from $\\bot$. The system is classical by permitting exactly one classical principle, the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM), which permits the inference of $A \\lor \\neg A$ for any formula $A$ without premises.

It is a well-posed problem in mathematical logic, specifically proof theory, grounded in established formal systems and principles.

We will first construct a formal derivation of Peirce's law in $\\mathsf{ND}$ that uses LEM a certain number of times, say $k$. This will establish that $N^{\\ast} \\le k$.\n2.  We will then prove that a derivation with fewer than $k$ applications of LEM is impossible. Specifically, we will show that Peirce's law is not derivable in a system with $k-1$ applications of LEM. This will establish that $N^{\\ast} \\ge k$.\nCombining these two results will yield the exact value of $N^{\\ast}$.\n\n**Part 1: Upper Bound for $N^{\\ast}$**\n\nWe will construct a derivation of $((A \\to B) \\to A) \\to A$ using exactly one application of LEM. This will demonstrate that $N^{\\ast} \\le 1$. The derivation proceeds as follows, using the rules of the system $\\mathsf{ND}$.\n\nTo prove $((A \\to B) \\to A) \\to A$, we use implication introduction ($\\to_{I}$). We assume $(A \\to B) \\to A$ and aim to derive $A$.\n\n1.  Assume $(A \\to B) \\to A$. This is our primary hypothesis for the main implication introduction.\n2.  We introduce an instance of the Law of Excluded Middle (LEM) for the formula $A$: $A \\lor \\neg A$. This is our single application of a classical rule.\n3.  We now proceed by disjunction elimination ($\\lor_{E}$) on $A \\lor \\neg A$. This requires us to show that $A$ can be derived from both disjuncts, $A$ and $\\neg A$.\n    \n    a.  **Case 1: Assume $A$.** In this case, we have immediately derived $A$. The goal is met.\n    \n    b.  **Case 2: Assume $\\neg A$.** Recall that $\\neg A$ is an abbreviation for $A \\to \\bot$. Our goal is to derive $A$ from this assumption, using the primary hypothesis from step $1$. To use the hypothesis $(A \\to B) \\to A$ via modus ponens ($\\to_{E}$), we first need to derive its antecedent, $A \\to B$.\n        \n        i.  To derive $A \\to B$, we use implication introduction ($\\to_{I}$). We assume $A$.\n        ii. Now, within this sub-derivation, we have two active assumptions: $\\neg A$ (from case 2) and $A$ (from sub-step i).\n        iii. Applying modus ponens ($\\to_{E}$) to the formula $\\neg A$ (which is $A \\to \\bot$) and the formula $A$, we derive $\\bot$.\n        iv. From $\\bot$, we use Ex Falso Quodlibet ($\\bot_{E}$) to derive the formula $B$.\n        v. We have now shown that assuming $A$ (in sub-step i) leads to $B$. We can therefore discharge this assumption and conclude $A \\to B$ by implication introduction ($\\to_{I}$).\n        vi. Now, we are back in the context of case 2, where we have derived $A \\to B$ under the assumption of $\\neg A$. We can now use our primary hypothesis from step $1$, which is $(A \\to B) \\to A$.\n        vii. Applying modus ponens ($\\to_{E}$) to $(A \\to B) \\to A$ and the just-derived $A \\to B$, we derive $A$.\n        \n    This concludes case 2. We have successfully derived $A$ under the assumption of $\\neg A$.\n\n4.  Since we have derived $A$ in both cases of the disjunction elimination (from assumption $A$ and from assumption $\\neg A$), we can conclude $A$. This step discharges the assumptions made for the $\\lor_{E}$ rule.\n5.  We have now shown that assuming $(A \\to B) \\to A$ (step $1$) allows us to derive $A$ (step $4$). We can therefore discharge our primary hypothesis and conclude $((A \\to B) \\to A) \\to A$ by implication introduction ($\\to_{I}$).\n\nThis derivation utilizes the Law of Excluded Middle exactly once (in step 2). Therefore, there exists a derivation $D$ of Peirce's law such that the classical invocation count $\\mathsf{C}(D) = 1$. By the definition of $N^{\\ast}$ as the minimum such count, this establishes the upper bound $N^{\\ast} \\le 1$.\n\n**Part 2: Lower Bound for $N^{\\ast}$**\n\nWe must now show that $N^{\\ast} \\ge 1$. This is equivalent to showing that a derivation with $\\mathsf{C}(D) = 0$ is impossible. A derivation with zero applications of LEM is a purely intuitionistic derivation. We need to prove that Peirce's law, $((A \\to B) \\to A) \\to A$, is not provable in intuitionistic logic.\n\nWe will use a soundness argument. Intuitionistic logic is sound with respect to Kripke semantics. This means that if a formula is provable in intuitionistic logic, it must be true in all worlds of all Kripke models. Consequently, to show that a formula is not provable, it is sufficient to construct a Kripke model containing a world where the formula is not true (not \"forced\").\n\nLet us construct a Kripke model $\\mathcal{K} = (W, \\le, v)$ as follows:\n-   The set of worlds is $W = \\{w_0, w_1\\}$.\n-   The partial order relation $\\le$ is defined by $w_0 \\le w_0$, $w_1 \\le w_1$, and $w_0 \\le w_1$.\n-   The valuation function $v$ assigns truth values to the atomic propositions $A$ and $B$ at each world. Let the valuation be:\n    -   $v(w_0, A) = \\text{false}$, $v(w_0, B) = \\text{false}$.\n    -   $v(w_1, A) = \\text{true}$, $v(w_1, B) = \\text{false}$.\n    This valuation respects the monotonicity property: for any atomic proposition $p$, if $w \\le w'$ and $v(w, p) = \\text{true}$, then $v(w', p) = \\text{true}$.\n\nThe forcing relation $w \\Vdash \\phi$ (\"world $w$ forces formula $\\phi$\") is defined recursively. For our purposes, the key definitions are:\n-   $w \\Vdash p$ if and only if $v(w, p) = \\text{true}$ for an atomic proposition $p$.\n-   $w \\Vdash \\phi \\to \\psi$ if and only if for all worlds $w' \\ge w$, if $w' \\Vdash \\phi$ then $w' \\Vdash \\psi$.\n\nWe want to show that Peirce's law is not forced at world $w_0$, i.e., $w_0 \\not\\Vdash ((A \\to B) \\to A) \\to A$.\nFor this to be true, we need to show that there exists a world $w' \\ge w_0$ such that $w' \\Vdash (A \\to B) \\to A$ and $w' \\not\\Vdash A$. Let's test $w_0$. We need to show:\n1.  $w_0 \\Vdash (A \\to B) \\to A$\n2.  $w_0 \\not\\Vdash A$\n\nLet's verify these two conditions.\nCondition $2$: $w_0 \\not\\Vdash A$. This is true by our definition of the valuation $v$, since $v(w_0, A) = \\text{false}$.\n\nCondition $1$: $w_0 \\Vdash (A \\to B) \\to A$. By the definition of the forcing relation for $\\to$, this means that for all $w' \\ge w_0$ (i.e., for $w' = w_0$ and $w' = w_1$), we must have: if $w' \\Vdash A \\to B$, then $w' \\Vdash A$.\nLet's check this for each $w'$.\n-   For $w' = w_0$: We evaluate the antecedent $w_0 \\Vdash A \\to B$. This holds if for all $w'' \\ge w_0$, if $w'' \\Vdash A$ then $w'' \\Vdash B$. Let's check the worlds $w'' \\ge w_0$:\n    -   At $w'' = w_0$: $w_0 \\not\\Vdash A$, so the condition that if $w_0 \\Vdash A$ then $w_0 \\Vdash B$ holds vacuously.\n    -   At $w'' = w_1$: We have $w_1 \\Vdash A$ (since $v(w_1, A)=\\text{true}$) and $w_1 \\not\\Vdash B$ (since $v(w_1, B)=\\text{false}$). Thus, the condition that if $w_1 \\Vdash A$ then $w_1 \\Vdash B$ is false.\n    Since the condition fails for $w_1$, we have $w_0 \\not\\Vdash A \\to B$. Because the antecedent ($w_0 \\Vdash A \\to B$) is false, the implication `if $w_0 \\Vdash A \\to B$ then $w_0 \\Vdash A$` is true.\n\n-   For $w' = w_1$: We evaluate the antecedent $w_1 \\Vdash A \\to B$. This holds if for all $w'' \\ge w_1$, if $w'' \\Vdash A$ then $w'' \\Vdash B$. The only world $w'' \\ge w_1$ is $w_1$ itself. We check if $w_1 \\Vdash A$ then $w_1 \\Vdash B$. As established above, this is false. Therefore, $w_1 \\not\\Vdash A \\to B$. Because the antecedent ($w_1 \\Vdash A \\to B$) is false, the implication `if $w_1 \\Vdash A \\to B$ then $w_1 \\Vdash A$` is true.\n\nSince the required implication holds for both $w_0$ and $w_1$, we have successfully shown that $w_0 \\Vdash (A \\to B) \\to A$.\n\nNow we can conclude our argument. We have shown that $w_0 \\Vdash (A \\to B) \\to A$ and $w_0 \\not\\Vdash A$. By the definition of forcing for implication, this means $w_0 \\not\\Vdash ((A \\to B) \\to A) \\to A$.\n\nSince we have found a Kripke model and a world in which Peirce's law is false, the formula is not intuitionistically valid. By the soundness of intuitionistic logic with respect to Kripke semantics, this implies that Peirce's law is not provable in intuitionistic logic (i.e., within the system $\\mathsf{ND}$ without any use of LEM).\nTherefore, any derivation of Peirce's law in $\\mathsf{ND}$ must make use of LEM at least once. This means for any such derivation $D$, we must have $\\mathsf{C}(D) \\ge 1$. This establishes the lower bound $N^{\\ast} \\ge 1$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom Part 1, we established that $N^{\\ast} \\le 1$.\nFrom Part 2, we established that $N^{\\ast} \\ge 1$.\nCombining these two inequalities, we uniquely determine the value of $N^{\\ast}$ to be $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2979850"}, {"introduction": "While most proof systems treat assumptions or premises as an unordered collection, this flexibility is enabled by structural rules that are often taken for granted.

The calculus is for classical propositional logic, but formulated with sequences instead of multisets for antecedents and succedents, and crucially, without the structural rules of exchange, weakening, or contraction.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the properties of this non-commutative logical system. In a standard sequent calculus like LK, the antecedent is a multiset of formulas, meaning the order is irrelevant. This is implicitly managed by the exchange rule, which allows adjacent formulas in the antecedent (or succedent) to be swapped:\n$$ \\frac{\\Gamma, C, D, \\Pi \\vdash \\Delta}{\\Gamma, D, C, \\Pi \\vdash \\Delta} (\\text{Exchange Left}) $$\nThe absence of this rule means the antecedent $\\Gamma$ in a sequent $\\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta$ is a sequence, and the order of formulas is strictly significant. Any reordering of formulas must be achieved using the available logical rules.\n\nThe available rules are the standard logical introduction rules for $\\land$, $\\lor$, and $\\to$, along with the identity (axiom) rule and the cut rule. Since the initial and final sequents consist solely of distinct atomic formulas, any permutation must be effected by a process that moves formulas. The only logical rules capable of moving formulas with respect to the turnstile symbol $\\vdash$ are the implication rules.\n\nLet's analyze the implication rules in a non-commutative setting. A standard formulation for the right and left introduction rules for implication is as follows:\n1.  Right Implication Rule ($\\to R$): This rule moves a formula from the antecedent to the succedent.\n    $$ \\frac{A, \\Gamma \\vdash \\Delta}{\\Gamma \\vdash A \\to \\Delta} $$\n    Here, the leftmost formula of the antecedent is moved.\n2.  Left Implication Rule ($\\to L$): This rule introduces an implication into the antecedent. A general form, consistent with the sequence-based nature of the calculus, is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash A, \\Delta \\quad \\Pi, B, \\Sigma \\vdash \\Theta}{\\Pi, \\Gamma, A \\to B, \\Sigma \\vdash \\Delta, \\Theta} $$\n    This rule takes contexts from the two premises and concatenates them in a specific order.\n\nThe combination of these rules could, in principle, simulate a permutation. For instance, one might move a formula from the antecedent to the succedent using $(\\to R)$ and then bring it back to the antecedent in a different position using $(\\to L)$ or the Cut rule.\n\nLet us provide a concrete analysis of why swapping adjacent formulas is not a derivable (or admissible) rule in this calculus. We will attempt to show that if a sequent $C, D, \\Gamma \\vdash E$ is provable, the sequent $D, C, \\Gamma \\vdash E$ is not necessarily provable. A canonical example of this involves modus ponens, which is the heart of implication elimination.\nConsider the formulas $A$ and $A \\to B$. A fundamental deduction is to conclude $B$ from these two hypotheses. Let's examine the provability of the corresponding sequents.\n\nCase 1: $A, A \\to B \\vdash B$.\nWe can prove this using the $(\\to L)$ rule as specified above: $\\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash A, \\Delta \\quad \\Pi, B, \\Sigma \\vdash \\Theta}{\\Pi, \\Gamma, A \\to B, \\Sigma \\vdash \\Delta, \\Theta}$.\nLet the main formula be $A \\to B$.

So, $A, A \\to B \\vdash B$ is provable.\n\nCase 2: $A \\to B, A \\vdash B$.\nUsing the same rule as above: $\\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash A, \\Delta \\quad \\Pi, B \\vdash \\Theta}{\\Gamma, \\Pi, A \\to B \\vdash \\Delta, \\Theta}$.\nTo prove $A \\to B, A \\vdash B$: We match the conclusion by setting $\\Gamma$ empty, $\\Pi = A$.\nThe premises become:\n1. $\\vdash A, \\Delta$: Not provable for atomic $A$.\n2. $A, B \\vdash B$: Not an axiom.\n\nThis simple example illustrates the fundamental constraint: the calculus is rigid with respect to the order of formulas. The $(\\to L)$ rule requires the context $\\Gamma$ (from the premise used to establish the antecedent of the implication) to appear to the left of the context $\\Pi$ (from the premise where the consequent of the implication is consumed).\nThe provability of $A, A \\to B \\vdash B$ but not $A \\to B, A \\vdash B$ constitutes a direct counterexample to the admissibility of swapping adjacent antecedent formulas.\n\nSince even a simple swap of adjacent formulas is not a valid transformation, no non-trivial permutation can be generated. Any sequence of operations involving logical rules will be constrained by the fixed ordering of contexts. A derivation from $A_{1}, \\dots, A_{6} \\vdash B$ might involve creating complex formulas like $A_{2} \\to (A_{1} \\to C)$, but these can only be \"unpacked\" in a way that respects the inherent order of application, which means the original order of hypotheses cannot be arbitrarily permuted.\n\nTherefore, the only permutation $\\sigma$ for which $A_{\\sigma(1)}, \\dots, A_{\\sigma(6)} \\vdash B$ is guaranteed to be derivable from $A_{1}, \\dots, A_{6} \\vdash B$ is the identity permutation, where $\\sigma(i) = i$ for all $i$. The derivability in this case is trivial, as the sequent is derivable from itself in zero steps.\n\nThe total number of permutations of the set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ is given by $6!$.\n$$ 6! = 720 $$\nOut of these $720$ permutations, only one is derivationally reachable: the identity permutation.\nThe number of permutations that are not derivationally reachable is the total number of permutations minus the number of reachable permutations.\nNumber of non-reachable permutations = $720 - 1 = 719$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{719}$$", "id": "2979859"}]}
