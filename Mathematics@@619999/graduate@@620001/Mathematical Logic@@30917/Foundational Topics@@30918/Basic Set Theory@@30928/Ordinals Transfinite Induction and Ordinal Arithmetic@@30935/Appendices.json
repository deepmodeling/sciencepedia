Using only the canonical transfinite recursion that defines ordinal addition, together with the notion of ordinal supremum as the least upper bound of a set of ordinals, compute the three ordinal sums $1+\\omega$, $\\omega+1$, and $\\omega+\\omega$, and justify each computation from first principles. Express your final answers as closed-form ordinal expressions.", "solution": "The problem statement is a well-defined exercise in the theory of von Neumann ordinals and is scientifically and mathematically sound. It provides all necessary definitions, either explicitly or by reference to canonical concepts (e.g., the recursive definition of ordinal addition), and is free from ambiguity, contradiction, or any other flaws that would render it invalid. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of three ordinal sums: $1+\\omega$, $\\omega+1$, and $\\omega+\\omega$. The framework is that of von Neumann ordinals, where an ordinal is the set of all smaller ordinals. The fundamental tool is the definition of ordinal addition by transfinite recursion on the second argument $\\beta$:\n1.  $\\alpha + 0 = \\alpha$\n2.  $\\alpha + (\\beta+1) = (\\alpha + \\beta) + 1$ (where $\\beta+1$ is the successor ordinal $\\beta \\cup \\{\\beta\\}$)\n3.  $\\alpha + \\lambda = \\sup_{\\gamma  \\lambda} (\\alpha + \\gamma) = \\bigcup_{\\gamma  \\lambda} (\\alpha + \\gamma)$ for a limit ordinal $\\lambda$.\n\nWe will apply these definitions to each case.\n\n**Computation of $1+\\omega$**\n\nThe ordinal $\\omega$ is the first infinite ordinal, defined as the set of all finite ordinals, $\\omega = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. It is a limit ordinal. Therefore, to compute $1+\\omega$, we must use the third case of the recursive definition with $\\alpha = 1$ and $\\lambda = \\omega$. The ordinals $\\gamma$ such that $\\gamma  \\omega$ are precisely the finite ordinals, which we denote by $n$.\n\n$$1+\\omega = \\sup_{n  \\omega} (1+n)$$\n\nLet us examine the terms $1+n$ for finite ordinals $n \\in \\omega$:\n- For $n=0$: $1+0 = 1$.\n- For $n=1$: $1+1 = (1+0)+1 = 1+1 = 2$.\n- For $n=2$: $1+2 = (1+1)+1 = 2+1 = 3$.\n- In general, for any finite ordinal $n$, the sum $1+n$ corresponds to the standard addition of natural numbers and results in the ordinal successor of $n$. That is, for $n \\in \\omega$, $1+n$ is the standard finite ordinal $n+1$.\n\nThe set of ordinals for which we must compute the supremum is therefore:\n$$\\{1+n \\mid n  \\omega\\} = \\{1+0, 1+1, 1+2, \\dots\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$$\nThis is the set of all non-zero finite ordinals. The supremum of a set of ordinals is their union.\n$$1+\\omega = \\sup\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\} = \\bigcup_{k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}} k = 1 \\cup 2 \\cup 3 \\cup \\dots$$\nSince each finite ordinal $k$ is the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$, the union is:\n$$\\bigcup_{k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}} \\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\} = \\omega$$\nThus, we conclude that $1+\\omega = \\omega$. This illustrates that ordinal addition is not commutative, as we will see that $\\omega+1 \\neq \\omega$.\n\n**Computation of $\\omega+1$**\n\nTo compute $\\omega+1$, we use the second case of the recursive definition for a successor ordinal. Here, $\\alpha = \\omega$ and the second term is $1$, which is the successor of $0$, i.e., $1 = 0+1$.\n\n$$\\omega+1 = \\omega + (0+1)$$\nApplying the rule $\\alpha + (\\beta+1) = (\\alpha+\\beta)+1$ with $\\beta=0$:\n$$\\omega + (0+1) = (\\omega+0)+1$$\nNext, we apply the base case of the recursion, $\\alpha+0 = \\alpha$, with $\\alpha=\\omega$:\n$$\\omega+0 = \\omega$$\nSubstituting this result back gives:\n$$\\omega+1 = (\\omega)+1 = \\omega+1$$\nThe expression $\\omega+1$ is itself a closed-form ordinal expression. By definition, it is the successor of $\\omega$, which is the ordinal $\\omega \\cup \\{\\omega\\}$. This is the smallest ordinal that is strictly greater than $\\omega$. It is distinct from $\\omega$, since $\\omega \\notin \\omega$ but $\\omega \\in \\omega \\cup \\{\\omega\\}$. Therefore, the result is simply $\\omega+1$.\n\n**Computation of $\\omega+\\omega$**\n\nTo compute $\\omega+\\omega$, we again recognize that the second term, $\\omega$, is a limit ordinal. We apply the third case of the definition with $\\alpha = \\omega$ and $\\lambda = \\omega$.\n\n$$\\omega+\\omega = \\sup_{n  \\omega} (\\omega+n)$$\nThe set of ordinals for which we must take the supremum is $\\{\\omega+n \\mid n  \\omega\\}$. This set consists of:\n- For $n=0$: $\\omega+0 = \\omega$.\n- For $n=1$: $\\omega+1$.\n- For $n=2$: $\\omega+2 = (\\omega+1)+1$.\n- ... and so on for all finite successors of $\\omega$.\nThe set is $\\{\\omega, \\omega+1, \\omega+2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe supremum of this set is the smallest ordinal that is an upper bound for all $\\omega+n$ where $n \\in \\omega$. This is by definition the limit of the sequence $\\omega, \\omega+1, \\omega+2, \\dots$. This ordinal is commonly denoted as $\\omega+\\omega$ or, using ordinal multiplication, as $\\omega \\cdot 2$. To formally justify this, we can show that $\\omega+\\omega$ matches the recursive definition of $\\omega \\cdot 2$.\n\nOrdinal multiplication $\\alpha \\cdot \\beta$ is defined by:\n1.  $\\alpha \\cdot 0 = 0$\n2.  $\\alpha \\cdot (\\beta+1) = (\\alpha \\cdot \\beta) + \\alpha$\n3.  $\\alpha \\cdot \\lambda = \\sup_{\\gamma  \\lambda} (\\alpha \\cdot \\gamma)$ for a limit ordinal $\\lambda$.\n\nLet's compute $\\omega \\cdot 2$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega \\cdot (1+1) $$\nUsing the second rule with $\\beta=1$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot (1+1) = (\\omega \\cdot 1) + \\omega $$\nNow we must compute $\\omega \\cdot 1$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega \\cdot (0+1) = (\\omega \\cdot 0) + \\omega = 0 + \\omega $$\nUsing the limit rule for addition, we have $0+\\omega = \\sup_{n  \\omega} (0+n) = \\sup_{n  \\omega} n = \\omega$.\nSo, $\\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\omega \\cdot 2$:\n$$ \\omega \\cdot 2 = (\\omega) + \\omega = \\omega+\\omega $$\nThis confirms that the sum $\\omega+\\omega$ is precisely the ordinal $\\omega \\cdot 2$. This represents the order type of two copies of $\\omega$ placed sequentially. It is the least upper bound of the set $\\{\\omega+n \\mid n  \\omega\\}$. The expression $\\omega \\cdot 2$ is the standard closed form.\n\nIn summary, the three computations yield:\n1.  $1+\\omega = \\omega$\n2.  $\\omega+1$\n3.  $\\omega+\\omega = \\omega \\cdot 2$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\omega  \\omega+1  \\omega \\cdot 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2978529"}, {"introduction": "Having established the non-commutative nature of ordinal addition, we now extend this exploration to ordinal multiplication.

It is a formal, objective exercise in mathematical logic.

It is the set of all finite ordinals (natural numbers), $\\omega = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. A key property, which we will use, is that for any finite ordinal $n  0$, $n + \\omega = \\omega$. This follows from the limit definition of addition: $n + \\omega = \\sup_{k  \\omega} (n + k)$. The set $\\{n+0, n+1, n+2, \\dots\\}$ is a cofinal subset of $\\omega$, so its supremum is $\\omega$.\n\n1.  **Computation of $2 \\cdot \\omega$**\n\nThe second factor, $\\omega$, is a limit ordinal. Therefore, we must apply the third clause of the recursive definition for ordinal multiplication. We set $\\alpha = 2$ and $\\lambda = \\omega$.\n$$2 \\cdot \\omega = \\sup_{\\beta  \\omega} (2 \\cdot \\beta)$$\nThe ordinals $\\beta$ that are less than $\\omega$ are the finite ordinals, which we can denote by $n$. So, the expression becomes:\n$$2 \\cdot \\omega = \\sup_{n  \\omega} (2 \\cdot n)$$\nFor finite ordinals $n$, the product $2 \\cdot n$ corresponds to the standard multiplication of natural numbers. The set over which we are taking the supremum is:\n$$\\{2 \\cdot 0, 2 \\cdot 1, 2 \\cdot 2, 2 \\cdot 3, \\dots\\} = \\{0, 2, 4, 6, \\dots\\}$$\nThe supremum of this set of ordinals is the smallest ordinal that is greater than or equal to every element in the set. Since this set consists of an unbounded sequence of finite ordinals, its supremum is the first infinite ordinal, $\\omega$.\n$$2 \\cdot \\omega = \\sup(\\{0, 2, 4, 6, \\dots\\}) = \\omega$$\nThe well-ordered interpretation confirms this: $2 \\cdot \\omega$ is the order type of $\\omega$ blocks of size $2$. This is an infinite sequence of pairs $(a_0, b_0), (a_1, b_1), \\dots$, which is order-isomorphic to the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$ and thus has order type $\\omega$.\n\n2.  **Computation of $\\omega \\cdot 2$**\n\nThe second factor, $2$, is a successor ordinal, since $2 = 1 + 1$. We apply the second clause of the recursive definition for ordinal multiplication with $\\alpha = \\omega$ and $\\beta=1$.\n$$\\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega \\cdot (1 + 1) = (\\omega \\cdot 1) + \\omega$$\nTo evaluate $\\omega \\cdot 1$, we use the same rule. Since $1 = 0+1$, we have:\n$$\\omega \\cdot 1 = \\omega \\cdot (0+1) = (\\omega \\cdot 0) + \\omega$$\nFrom the first clause of the multiplication definition, $\\omega \\cdot 0 = 0$. Thus:\n$$\\omega \\cdot 1 = 0 + \\omega = \\omega$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\omega \\cdot 2$:\n$$\\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega + \\omega$$\nThis result, $\\omega + \\omega$, is a canonical ordinal itself, often written as $\\omega \\cdot 2$. It is distinct from $2 \\cdot \\omega = \\omega$, demonstrating the non-commutativity of ordinal multiplication.\nThe well-ordered interpretation for $\\omega \\cdot 2$ is the order type of $2$ blocks of size $\\omega$. This corresponds to a copy of the natural numbers followed by a second, distinct copy of the natural numbers. The order type is precisely $\\omega + \\omega$.\n\n3.  **Computation of $(\\omega + 1) \\cdot 2$**\n\nAgain, the second factor is the successor ordinal $2 = 1+1$. We let $\\alpha = \\omega+1$ and use the second clause of the multiplication definition.\n$$(\\omega + 1) \\cdot 2 = (\\omega + 1) \\cdot (1 + 1) = ((\\omega + 1) \\cdot 1) + (\\omega + 1)$$\nAs shown previously, for any ordinal $\\gamma$, $\\gamma \\cdot 1 = \\gamma$. So, $(\\omega + 1) \\cdot 1 = \\omega + 1$. The expression becomes:\n$$(\\omega + 1) \\cdot 2 = (\\omega + 1) + (\\omega + 1)$$\nTo evaluate this sum, we must proceed carefully as ordinal addition is not associative in general. The second term is a successor ordinal: $\\omega+1$. We use the successor rule for addition, $\\gamma + (\\delta+1) = (\\gamma+\\delta)+1$.\n$$(\\omega + 1) + (\\omega + 1) = ((\\omega + 1) + \\omega) + 1$$\nNow we must compute the inner term, $(\\omega+1)+\\omega$. Here, the second term, $\\omega$, is a limit ordinal. We use the limit rule for addition:\n$$(\\omega + 1) + \\omega = \\sup_{\\beta  \\omega} ((\\omega + 1) + \\beta)$$\nFor $\\beta = n$, a finite ordinal, we have $(\\omega + 1) + n = \\omega + (1+n)$. The set over which we take the supremum is:\n$$\\{\\omega + (1+0), \\omega + (1+1), \\omega+(1+2), \\dots\\} = \\{\\omega+1, \\omega+2, \\omega+3, \\dots\\}$$\nThe supremum of this set is the smallest ordinal greater than or equal to all its elements. This ordinal is $\\omega + \\omega$.\nSo, $(\\omega+1)+\\omega = \\omega+\\omega$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $(\\omega + 1) \\cdot 2$:\n$$(\\omega+1) \\cdot 2 = (\\omega+\\omega) + 1$$\nThis can also be written as $(\\omega \\cdot 2) + 1$.\nThe well-order interpretation yields the same result: $(\\omega+1) \\cdot 2$ is the order type of two blocks of type $\\omega+1$. An order of type $\\omega+1$ is a countable sequence with a final element. Concatenating two such blocks gives a countable sequence, a final element, another countable sequence, and a final element. The first countable sequence has order type $\\omega$. Its final element plus the second countable sequence yields an order type of $1+\\omega=\\omega$. So we have $\\omega + \\omega$. Finally, the last element is added, giving $(\\omega+\\omega)+1$.\n\nIn summary, the three computed products are:\n- $2 \\cdot \\omega = \\omega$\n- $\\omega \\cdot 2 = \\omega + \\omega$\n- $(\\omega+1) \\cdot 2 = (\\omega + \\omega) + 1$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega  \\omega + \\omega  (\\omega + \\omega) + 1 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2978509"}, {"introduction": "We now move from foundational definitions to a more complex application, synthesizing the rules of ordinal arithmetic to tackle a non-trivial product.
