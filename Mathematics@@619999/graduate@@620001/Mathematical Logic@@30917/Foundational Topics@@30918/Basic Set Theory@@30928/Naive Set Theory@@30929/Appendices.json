This exercise focuses on ordinal arithmetic, which is distinguished by its non-commutative multiplication and a unique division algorithm. By finding the quotient $\\gamma$ and remainder $\\rho$ for a right division of the form $\\alpha = \\beta \\cdot \\gamma + \\rho$, you will gain hands-on experience with the rigorous, yet often counter-intuitive, logic that underpins the structure of well-ordered sets. [@problem_id:491369]", "id": "491369", "problem": "In naive set theory, an ordinal number (or simply, an ordinal) is the order type of a well-ordered set. Arithmetic on ordinals exhibits properties that are distinct from standard arithmetic on integers.\n\n**Background:**\n- **Ordinal Addition:** For ordinals $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, the sum $\\alpha+\\beta$ is the order type of the disjoint union of a set of order type $\\alpha$ and a set of order type $\\beta$, where every element of the first set is defined to be smaller than every element of the second set. This operation is associative but not commutative. For example, $1+\\omega=\\omega$, but $\\omega+1 > \\omega$.\n- **Ordinal Multiplication:** The product $\\alpha\\cdot\\beta$ is the order type of the Cartesian product of two sets with order types $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, ordered anti-lexicographically (also known as reverse lexicographical order). This operation is associative and left-distributive over addition, i.e., $\\alpha(\\beta+\\gamma) = \\alpha\\beta+\\alpha\\gamma$, but it is not right-distributive or commutative. For example, $2\\cdot\\omega = \\omega$, but $\\omega\\cdot 2 = \\omega+\\omega$.\n- **Cantor Normal Form:** Any ordinal $\\alpha > 0$ can be uniquely written as a finite sum $\\alpha = \\omega^{\\beta_1}c_1 + \\omega^{\\beta_2}c_2 + \\dots + \\omega^{\\beta_k}c_k$, where $\\beta_1 > \\beta_2 > \\dots > \\beta_k \\ge 0$ are ordinals and $c_1, \\dots, c_k$ are positive integers.\n- A useful property for calculations involving the limit ordinal $\\omega$ is that for any ordinal $\\delta > 0$ and finite ordinal (natural number) $n>0$, we have $(\\delta+n)\\cdot\\omega = \\delta \\cdot \\omega$. In particular, for positive integers $k,m$, we have $(\\omega \\cdot k + m) \\cdot \\omega = \\omega^2$.\n\n**The Ordinal Division Algorithm (Right Division):**\nGiven any two ordinals $\\alpha$ (the dividend) and $\\beta > 0$ (the divisor), there exist unique ordinals $\\gamma$ (the quotient) and $\\rho$ (the remainder) such that:\n$$ \\alpha = \\beta \\cdot \\gamma + \\rho $$\nand $\\rho < \\beta$.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nLet the dividend be the ordinal $\\alpha = \\omega^2 + \\omega \\cdot 3 + 1$ and the divisor be the ordinal $\\beta = \\omega \\cdot 5 + 4$. Using the ordinal division algorithm, determine the unique quotient $\\gamma$ and remainder $\\rho$. Your answer should be the ordered pair $(\\gamma, \\rho)$.\n\n", "solution": "1.
