We proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the cardinality of a set $S$ be denoted by $|S|$. We are given that $|\\mathbb{N}| = \\aleph_0$. From the given fact (i), the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is also infinite, its cardinality is the same as that of the natural numbers, so $|\\mathbb{Q}| = \\aleph_0$.\n\nWe will compute the cardinality of each set using the foundational definitions of cardinal arithmetic and the provided standard facts.\n\n1.  **Computation of $|\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{Q}|$**\n    The cardinality of the Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$ is given by the product of their cardinalities, i.e., $|A \\times B| = |A| \\cdot |B|$.\n    Applying this definition to the sets $\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$, we have:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{Q}| = |\\mathbb{N}| \\cdot |\\mathbb{Q}|$$\n    Substituting the known cardinalities, we get:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{Q}| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0$$\n    The cardinal product $\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0$ is, by definition, the cardinality of the set $\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{N}$. We are given fact (ii), which states that there exists a bijection between $\\mathbb{N}$ and $\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{N}$. The existence of such a bijection implies that the two sets have the same cardinality:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{N}| = |\\mathbb{N}|$$\n    Therefore, we can conclude:\n    $$\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$$\n    Substituting this result back, we find the cardinality of $\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{Q}$:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{Q}| = \\aleph_0$$\n\n2.  **Computation of $|\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{Q}}|$**\n    The cardinality of the set of all functions from a set $B$ to a set $A$, denoted $A^B$, is given by cardinal exponentiation: $|A^B| = |A|^{|B|}$.\n    Applying this definition, we have:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{Q}}| = |\\mathbb{N}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|}$$\n    Substituting the known cardinalities, we need to compute the value of $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{Q}}| = \\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$$\n    To evaluate this expression, we will use the given fact (iv), the Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder (CBS) theorem. The theorem states that if there exist injective functions $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$ between two sets $A$ and $B$, then there exists a bijection between them, which implies $|A| = |B|$. In terms of cardinals $\\kappa$ and $\\lambda$, if $\\kappa \\le \\lambda$ and $\\lambda \\le \\kappa$, then $\\kappa = \\lambda$. We will show that $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n    First, we establish the inequality $2^{\\aleph_0} \\le \\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    By definition, $2^{\\aleph_0} = |\\{0, 1\\}^{\\mathbb{N}}|$ and $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} = |\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}|$.\n    Consider the set of all functions from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\{0, 1\\}$, which is $\\{0, 1\\}^{\\mathbb{N}}$. Since $\\{0, 1\\} \\subset \\mathbb{N}$, any function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ is also a function from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\mathbb{N}$. This means $\\{0, 1\\}^{\\mathbb{N}} \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}$. The inclusion map is an injection, so we have:\n    $$|\\{0, 1\\}^{\\mathbb{N}}| \\le |\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}|$$\n    $$2^{\\aleph_0} \\le \\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$$\n\n    Next, we establish the inequality $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} \\le 2^{\\aleph_0}$. We will use the laws of cardinal arithmetic.\n    By Cantor's theorem, $|\\mathbb{N}|  |\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})|$. Given fact (iii) states $|\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, so we have $\\aleph_0  2^{\\aleph_0}$. This implies $\\aleph_0 \\le 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    Using this, we can write the following chain of inequalities for the cardinal $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$:\n    $$\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} \\le (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0}$$\n    Using the law of cardinal exponentiation $(\\kappa^{\\lambda})^{\\mu} = \\kappa^{\\lambda \\cdot \\mu}$, we have:\n    $$(2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0}$$\n    From our first computation, we know that $\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$. Substituting this gives:\n    $$2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$$\n    Thus, we have shown that $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} \\le 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n    Having established both $2^{\\aleph_0} \\le \\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$ and $\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} \\le 2^{\\aleph_0}$, the Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem allows us to conclude that the cardinalities are equal:\n    $$\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$$\n    Therefore, the cardinality of $\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is:\n    $$|\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{Q}}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$$\n\n3.  **Computation of $|\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}|$**\n    Similar to the previous case, we use the definition of cardinal exponentiation:\n    $$|\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}| = |\\mathbb{Q}|^{|\\mathbb{N}|}$$\n    Substituting the known cardinalities:\n    $$|\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}| = \\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$$\n    This is the same cardinal expression evaluated in the second part. The set $\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is the set of all functions from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $|\\mathbb{Q}| = |\\mathbb{N}| = \\aleph_0$, there exists a bijection between these sets. This implies that there is a bijection between the sets of functions $\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and $\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}$, and so they have the same cardinality, $|\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}| = |\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{N}}| = \\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    As we have rigorously shown in the preceding section:\n    $$\\aleph_0^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$$\n    Therefore, the cardinality of $\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is:\n    $$|\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$$\n\nIn summary, the cardinalities are:\n-   $|\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{Q}| = \\aleph_0$\n-   $|\\mathbb{N}^{\\mathbb{Q}}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$\n-   $|\\mathbb{Q}^{\\mathbb{N}}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\aleph_0  2^{\\aleph_0}  2^{\\aleph_0}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2969932"}, {"introduction": "Having established the basic arithmetic of $\\aleph_0$, we now turn our attention to the continuum, $|\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.

Computation of $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}|$\n\nWe will use the Schröder–Bernstein theorem on the sets $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Injection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$:**\nWe must exhibit an injection $f_1: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$. Consider the function defined by $f_1(x) = (x, 0)$ for any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. To verify that $f_1$ is injective, assume $f_1(x_1) = f_1(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. By definition, this means $(x_1, 0) = (x_2, 0)$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f_1$ is an injection. The existence of this injection establishes that $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}|$.\n\n**Injection from $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$:**\nNext, we must exhibit an injection $g_1: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. As established, there exist bijections between $\\mathbb{R}$ and $2^{\\mathbb{N}}$. Let $\\phi: \\mathbb{R} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ be such a bijection. We can construct the desired injection $g_1$ as a composition of three functions:\n\n1.  A bijection $\\alpha: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ defined as $\\alpha((x, y)) = (\\phi(x), \\phi(y))$. Since $\\phi$ is a bijection, $\\alpha$ is also a bijection, and thus an injection.\n\n2.  An injection $\\beta: 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$. An element of $2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is a pair of infinite binary sequences, $(s, t)$, where $s = (s_0, s_1, s_2, \\dots)$ and $t = (t_0, t_1, t_2, \\dots)$, with $s_i, t_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. We define the function $\\beta$ by interleaving these two sequences into a single sequence $u = \\beta((s, t))$. The sequence $u = (u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3, \\dots)$ is defined by setting $u_{2k} = s_k$ and $u_{2k+1} = t_k$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. This function is injective: if $\\beta((s, t)) = \\beta((s', t'))$, the resulting interleaved sequences are identical. This implies that their even-indexed terms are the same (so $s=s'$) and their odd-indexed terms are the same (so $t=t'$). Thus, $(s, t)=(s', t')$. In fact, $\\beta$ is a bijection.\n\n3.  The bijection $\\phi^{-1}: 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. This exists because $\\phi$ is a bijection.\n\nThe composite function $g_1 = \\phi^{-1} \\circ \\beta \\circ \\alpha$ is a mapping from $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Since it is a composition of injective functions (two of which are bijections), $g_1$ is an injection. The existence of this injection establishes that $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nSince we have shown $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}|$ and $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R}|$, the Schröder–Bernstein theorem implies that $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}| = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n### 2. Computation of $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}|$\n\nWe proceed similarly, using the Schröder–Bernstein theorem on the sets $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Injection from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$:**\nWe define an injection $f_2: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$. Let $q_0$ be any fixed rational number, for instance $q_0 = 0$. Consider the function $f_2(x) = (x, q_0)$. This function is injective because if $f_2(x_1) = f_2(x_2)$, then $(x_1, q_0) = (x_2, q_0)$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}|$.\n\n**Injection from $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$:**\nNext, we construct an injection $g_2: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{R}$. We use the bijections $\\phi: \\mathbb{R} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and $\\psi: \\mathbb{Q} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ (since $|\\mathbb{Q}| = |\\mathbb{N}|$). The injection $g_2$ is constructed from the following composition:\n\n1.  A bijection $\\gamma: \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ defined by $\\gamma((x, q)) = (\\phi(x), \\psi(q))$. This is a bijection because $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ are bijections.\n\n2.  An injection $\\delta: 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\to 2^{\\mathbb{N}}$. Let an element of $2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ be a pair $(s, n)$, where $s = (s_0, s_1, s_2, \\dots)$ is an infinite binary sequence and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We define a new sequence $v = \\delta((s, n))$ by prefixing $s$ with a representation of $n$. A simple injective map is to prepend $n$ copies of the digit $1$ followed by a $0$ to the sequence $s$. Formally, the sequence $v = (v_0, v_1, v_2, \\dots)$ is defined as:\n    $v_k = 1$ for $0 \\le k  n$\n    $v_n = 0$\n    $v_k = s_{k-(n+1)}$ for $k  n$\n    This function $\\delta$ is injective. If $\\delta((s, n)) = \\delta((s', n'))$, the resulting sequences are identical. The position of the first $0$ in the sequence $\\delta((s,n))$ is at index $n$. Thus, if the sequences are identical, their first $0$ must be at the same position, which means $n=n'$. With $n=n'$, the remaining parts of the sequences (after the prefix) must also be identical, which means $s=s'$. Therefore, $(s, n) = (s', n')$, and $\\delta$ is an injection.\n\n3.  The bijection $\\phi^{-1}: 2^{\\mathbb{N}} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe composite function $g_2 = \\phi^{-1} \\circ \\delta \\circ \\gamma$ is an injection from $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. The existence of this injection establishes that $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}| \\le |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nSince we have shown $|\\mathbb{R}| \\le |\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}|$ and $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}| \\le |\\mathbb{R}|$, the Schröder–Bernstein theorem implies that $|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}| = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nIn summary, both cardinalities are equal to the cardinality of the continuum.\n$|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$\n$|\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{Q}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2^{\\aleph_0}  2^{\\aleph_0}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2969942"}, {"introduction": "We conclude our hands-on practice by applying these skills to a fascinating problem in combinatorial set theory: counting the total number of possible well-orders on a given set.

The cardinality of this ordinal must be $|\\alpha| = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\nGiven this one well-order $\\prec$, we can generate others by applying permutations of $\\mathbb{R}$. Let $\\sigma: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a bijection. We define a new well-order $\\prec_{\\sigma}$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ by:\n$$\nx \\prec_{\\sigma} y \\iff \\sigma(x) \\prec \\sigma(y)\n$$\nEach distinct permutation $\\sigma$ defines a distinct well-order relation $\\prec_{\\sigma}$. The number of such relations is the cardinality of the symmetric group on $\\mathbb{R}$, denoted $|S_{\\mathbb{R}}|$.\nUsing the same theorem of cardinal arithmetic as before, for the infinite cardinal $\\kappa = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, the number of permutations is:\n$$\n|S_{\\mathbb{R}}| = \\kappa! = (2^{\\aleph_0})! = 2^{\\kappa} = 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}\n$$\nThis provides a collection of $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$ distinct well-orders on $\\mathbb{R}$, thereby establishing the lower bound:\n$$\n|W_{\\mathbb{R}}| \\ge 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}\n$$\n\n**Conclusion for $|W_{\\mathbb{R}}|$**\nThe inequalities $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}} \\le |W_{\\mathbb{R}}| \\le 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$ and the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein theorem lead to the conclusion:\n$$\n|W_{\\mathbb{R}}| = 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}\n$$\n\nIn summary, the cardinality of the set of well-orders on $\\mathbb{N}$ is $2^{\\aleph_0}$, and the cardinality of the set of well-orders on $\\mathbb{R}$ is $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2^{\\aleph_0}  2^{2^{\\aleph_0}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2969915"}]}
