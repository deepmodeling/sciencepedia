The cardinalities of these sets are denoted by $|X|$ and $|Y|$, respectively. Since the sets are finite, $|X|$ and $|Y|$ are non-negative integers.\n\nBy definition, a binary relation $R$ from the set $X$ to the set $Y$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $X \\times Y$. Formally, $R \\subseteq X \\times Y$. Consequently, the problem of counting the total number of distinct binary relations from $X$ to $Y$ is equivalent to the problem of counting the total number of distinct subsets of the set $X \\times Y$.\n\nThe number of subsets of any finite set $S$ is given by $2^{|S|}$, where $|S|$ is the cardinality of $S$. To apply this principle, we must first determine the cardinality of the Cartesian product, $|X \\times Y|$.\n\nThe Cartesian product $X \\times Y$ is defined as the set of all ordered pairs $(x, y)$ where $x$ is an element of $X$ and $y$ is an element of $Y$. Symbolically, $X \\times Y = \\{ (x, y) \\mid x \\in X \\text{ and } y \\in Y \\}$.\n\nWe can determine the number of elements in $X \\times Y$ using a fundamental counting principle, the rule of product. To construct an element $(x, y) \\in X \\times Y$, we must perform two independent tasks:\n1.  Choose an element $x$ from the set $X$. There are $|X|$ possible choices.\n2.  Choose an element $y$ from the set $Y$. There are $|Y|$ possible choices.\n\nSince the choice of $x$ and the choice of $y$ are independent, the total number of unique ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is the product of the number of choices for each component. Therefore, the cardinality of the Cartesian product is:\n$$|X \\times Y| = |X| \\cdot |Y|$$\n\nNow, we return to the task of counting the number of subsets of the set $X \\times Y$. Let $S = X \\times Y$. We have established that $|S| = |X| \\cdot |Y|$.\n\nTo construct a subset of $S$, we must make a decision for each element of $S$. For each element $s \\in S$, there are exactly two possibilities:\n1.  The element $s$ is included in the subset.\n2.  The element $s$ is not included in the subset.\n\nThis constitutes a binary choice for each of the $|S|$ elements. The decision for any one element is independent of the decisions for all other elements. Applying the rule of product again, if we have $|S|$ independent events, and each event has $2$ possible outcomes, the total number of distinct combined outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes for each event.\n\nTotal number of subsets = $\\underbrace{2 \\times 2 \\times \\cdots \\times 2}_{|S| \\text{ factors}}$\n\nThis product is equal to $2^{|S|}$.\n\nSubstituting $|S| = |X \\times Y| = |X| \\cdot |Y|$, we find that the total number of distinct subsets of $X \\times Y$ is $2^{|X| \\cdot |Y|}$.\n\nSince each subset of $X \\times Y$ corresponds to a unique binary relation from $X$ to $Y$, the total number of distinct binary relations is precisely this quantity. Thus, the closed-form expression for the total number of distinct binary relations from $X$ to $Y$ is $2^{|X| \\cdot |Y|}$.

The problem statement establishes a bijective correspondence between the set of equivalence relations on $X$ and the set of partitions of $X$. Therefore, the task reduces to counting the number of distinct partitions of the set $X$. This counting must be performed from first principles by analyzing the possible structures of the partitions.\n\nLet $X$ be a set with $3$ elements. We can represent it as $X=\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ without loss of generality. A partition of $X$ is a collection of non-empty, pairwise disjoint subsets of $X$, called blocks, whose union is $X$. The sum of the cardinalities of the blocks in any partition must equal the cardinality of the set $X$, which is $3$.\n\nTo systematically count all possible partitions, we can classify them by the sizes of their blocks. This corresponds to finding all integer partitions of the number $3$. An integer partition of a positive integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the addends does not matter. The integer partitions of $3$ are:\n1. $3$\n2. $2+1$\n3. $1+1+1$\n\nWe now perform a case analysis for each of these structures.\n\nCase 1: One block of size $3$.\nThis structure corresponds to the integer partition $3$. The partition must consist of a single block that contains all $3$ elements of $X$. The only such partition is $\\{\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}\\}$. This corresponds to the trivial equivalence relation where all elements are related to each other. There is exactly $1$ partition of this type.\n\nCase 2: One block of size $2$ and one block of size $1$.\nThis structure corresponds to the integer partition $2+1$. To form a partition of this type, we need to select $2$ elements from the set $X$ to form the block of size $2$. The remaining $1$ element will automatically form the block of size $1$. The number of ways to choose $2$ elements from a set of $3$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{3}{2}$.\n$$ \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \\frac{3!}{2!1!} = \\frac{3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1) \\times 1} = 3 $$\nThe three distinct partitions are:\n- $\\{\\{x_1, x_2\\}, \\{x_3\\}\\}$\n- $\\{\\{x_1, x_3\\}, \\{x_2\\}\\}$\n- $\\{\\{x_2, x_3\\}, \\{x_1\\}\\}$\nThus, there are $3$ partitions of this type.\n\nCase 3: Three blocks of size $1$.\nThis structure corresponds to the integer partition $1+1+1$. Each block contains a single element. For the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$, each element must be in its own block. This results in the partition $\\{\\{x_1\\}, \\{x_2\\}, \\{x_3\\}\\}$. As a partition is a set of sets, the order of the blocks is immaterial. Therefore, there is only one way to form such a partition. This corresponds to the identity equivalence relation, where each element is related only to itself. There is exactly $1$ partition of this type.\n\nTo find the total number of partitions of $X$, we sum the counts from all possible cases.\nTotal number of partitions = (Number from Case 1) + (Number from Case 2) + (Number from Case 3).\n$$ \\text{Total} = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 $$\nBased on the bijection stated in the problem, the number of distinct equivalence relations on a set with $3$ elements is equal to the number of partitions of that set.

The exercise [@problem_id:2981488] reveals a beautiful and powerful duality: the set of all order-preserving maps from a poset $P$ to the simple two-element chain $C_{2} = \\{0 \\lt 1\\}$ corresponds directly to special internal subsets of $P$ called order ideals or filters. You are challenged to make this connection precise and use it as an elegant counting technique, demonstrating how external mappings can illuminate the internal structure of a mathematical object.", "id": "2981488", "problem": "Let $P$ be the finite partially ordered set (poset) with underlying set $\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h\\}$ whose order is the reflexive and transitive closure of the following covering relations: $a \\prec c$, $a \\prec d$, $b \\prec d$, $b \\prec e$, $c \\prec f$, $e \\prec f$, $d \\prec g$, $f \\prec h$, $g \\prec h$.

Your final answer must be a single integer. No rounding is needed.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of order-preserving maps from a given finite partially ordered set (poset) $P$ to the two-element chain $C_2$. It also requires a justification from first principles for the correspondence between such maps and either order ideals or order filters of $P$.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental connection between order-preserving maps into $C_2$ and specific subsets of $P$. Let the poset be $P$ with its order relation denoted by $\\le_P$. Let $C_2$ be the poset with underlying set $\\{0, 1\\}$ and order $0 < 1$.\n\nAn order-preserving map, or monotone function, $f: P \\to C_2$ is defined by the property that for any two elements $x, y \\in P$, if $x \\le_P y$, then $f(x) \\le_{C_2} f(y)$. In the context of $C_2$, this means if $x \\le_P y$, it is not possible to have $f(x)=1$ and $f(y)=0$.\n\nWe will demonstrate that there is a bijection between the set of all order-preserving maps $f: P \\to C_2$ and the set of all order filters of $P$. An order filter (or up-set) of $P$ is a subset $U \\subseteq P$ such that for any $x \\in U$ and any $y \\in P$, if $x \\le_P y$, then $y \\in U$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all order-preserving functions from $P$ to $C_2$, and let $\\mathcal{U}(P)$ be the set of all order filters of $P$.\n\nConsider the mapping $\\Phi: \\mathcal{F} \\to \\mathcal{U}(P)$ defined by $\\Phi(f) = f^{-1}(\\{1\\}) = \\{x \\in P \\mid f(x) = 1\\}$. We must show that for any $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, the set $U = \\Phi(f)$ is indeed an order filter. Let $x \\in U$ and let $y \\in P$ be any element such that $x \\le_P y$. By definition of $U$, $f(x) = 1$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, $x \\le_P y$ implies $f(x) \\le_{C_2} f(y)$, which means $1 \\le_{C_2} f(y)$. In $C_2$, the only element greater than or equal to $1$ is $1$ itself. Thus, $f(y)=1$, which implies $y \\in U$. This satisfies the definition of an order filter. So, $\\Phi$ is well-defined.\n\nNext, consider the mapping $\\Psi: \\mathcal{U}(P) \\to \\mathcal{F}$ defined as follows: for any order filter $U \\in \\mathcal{U}(P)$, let $\\Psi(U) = f_U$, where $f_U: P \\to C_2$ is the characteristic function of $U$, given by:\n$$ f_U(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } x \\in U \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x \\notin U \\end{cases} $$\nWe must show that $f_U$ is an order-preserving map. Let $x, y \\in P$ be such that $x \\le_P y$. We need to show $f_U(x) \\le_{C_2} f_U(y)$.\nCase 1: $f_U(x) = 0$. The inequality $0 \\le_{C_2} f_U(y)$ is always true, as $f_U(y)$ is either $0$ or $1$.\nCase 2: $f_U(x) = 1$. By definition of $f_U$, this means $x \\in U$. Since $U$ is an order filter and $x \\le_P y$, it follows from the definition of a filter that $y \\in U$. Consequently, $f_U(y) = 1$. The inequality $1 \\le_{C_2} 1$ holds.\nIn both cases, the order-preserving property is satisfied. So, $\\Psi$ is well-defined.\n\nThe mappings $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi$ are inverses of each other. For any $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, $\\Psi(\\Phi(f))$ is the characteristic function of the set $f^{-1}(\\{1\\})$, which is precisely the function $f$ itself. For any $U \\in \\mathcal{U}(P)$, $\\Phi(\\Psi(U))$ is the preimage of $\\{1\\}$ under the characteristic function $f_U$, which is the set $U$ itself. Therefore, a bijection exists between the set of order-preserving maps $f:P \\to C_2$ and the set of order filters of $P$.\n\nAn analogous argument shows a bijection with order ideals (or down-sets) $I$ by considering the preimage of $\\{0\\}$, $I = f^{-1}(\\{0\\})$.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to counting the number of order filters of the poset $P$. There is a well-known bijection between the order filters of a finite poset and its antichains. An antichain is a subset of $P$ in which any two distinct elements are incomparable.\n\nLet $U$ be an order filter. The set of minimal elements of $U$, denoted $\\min(U)$, is an antichain. If $x, y \\in \\min(U)$ and $x \\le_P y$, then since $x \\in U$ and $U$ is a filter, $y \\in U$. But $x < y$ would contradict the minimality of $y$ in $U$. Thus $x=y$.\nConversely, for any antichain $A \\subseteq P$, the set $A^{\\uparrow} = \\{x \\in P \\mid \\exists a \\in A, a \\le_P x\\}$ is an order filter. The minimal elements of $A^\\uparrow$ are precisely the elements of $A$. This establishes a bijection.\n\nTherefore, the number of order-preserving maps equals the number of antichains of $P$. We proceed to count the antichains of $P$. The poset $P$ is defined by the set of elements $\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h\\}$ and the covering relations $a \\prec c$, $a \\prec d$, $b \\prec d$, $b \\prec e$, $c \\prec f$, $e \\prec f$, $d \\prec g$, $f \\prec h$, $g \\prec h$. The Hasse diagram for this poset has a single maximal element $h$.\n\nLet $N(Q)$ be the number of antichains of a poset $Q$. The set of antichains of $P$ can be partitioned into those that contain the maximal element $h$ and those that do not.\nIf an antichain contains $h$, it cannot contain any other element, as all other elements $x$ satisfy $x <_P h$. Thus, $\\{h\\}$ is the only antichain containing $h$.\nThe antichains not containing $h$ are precisely the antichains of the sub-poset $P' = P \\setminus \\{h\\}$.\nSo, $N(P) = 1 + N(P')$.\n\nThe sub-poset $P'$ has elements $\\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\\}$ and maximal elements $\\{f, g\\}$, which are incomparable. We can partition the antichains of $P'$ into four disjoint sets:\n1.  Antichains containing both $f$ and $g$. Let $A$ be such an antichain. Since $f,g \\in A$, $A$ cannot contain any elements $x$ such that $x \\le_P f$ or $x \\le_P g$. The set of elements less than $f$ or $g$ is $\\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$. Thus, no other elements can be in $A$. The only such antichain is $\\{f,g\\}$. There is $1$ such antichain.\n2.  Antichains containing $f$ but not $g$. Such an antichain $A$ is of the form $\\{f\\} \\cup A_0$, where $A_0$ is an antichain of elements from $P'$ that are incomparable with $f$ and are not $g$. The elements related to $f$ in $P'$ are $\\{a,b,c,e\\}$. The only remaining element in $P'$ is $d$. $d$ is incomparable to $f$. Thus $A_0$ must be an antichain of the sub-poset $\\{d\\}$. The antichains of $\\{d\\}$ are $\\emptyset$ and $\\{d\\}$. This gives us two antichains: $\\{f\\}$ and $\\{f,d\\}$. There are $2$ such antichains.\n3.  Antichains containing $g$ but not $f$. Such an antichain $A$ is of the form $\\{g\\} \\cup A_0$, where $A_0$ is an antichain of elements from $P'$ that are incomparable with $g$ and are not $f$. The elements related to $g$ in $P'$ are $\\{a,b,d\\}$. The remaining elements are $\\{c,e\\}$. $c$ and $e$ are incomparable with $g$ and with each other. Thus $A_0$ must be an antichain of the sub-poset $\\{c,e\\}$. The antichains of $\\{c,e\\}$ are $\\emptyset, \\{c\\}, \\{e\\}, \\{c,e\\}$. This gives four antichains: $\\{g\\}, \\{g,c\\}, \\{g,e\\}, \\{g,c,e\\}$. There are $4$ such antichains.\n4.  Antichains containing neither $f$ nor $g$. These are precisely the antichains of the sub-poset $P'' = P' \\setminus \\{f,g\\} = \\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$.\n\nWe need to compute $N(P'')$. The relations in $P''$ are $a<c, a<d, b<d, b<e$. We can use a similar recursive counting. The maximal elements of $P''$ are $c,d,e$. Let's pivot on element $d$. The antichains of $P''$ either contain $d$ or they do not.\n- Antichains of $P''$ containing $d$: An antichain $A$ containing $d$ cannot contain elements related to $d$. These are $a$ and $b$. The remaining elements are $\\{c,e\\}$, which are both incomparable to $d$. So $A = \\{d\\} \\cup A_0$ where $A_0$ is an antichain of $\\{c,e\\}$. As before, there are $4$ such antichains $A_0$. So there are $4$ antichains of $P''$ containing $d$: $\\{d\\}, \\{d,c\\}, \\{d,e\\}, \\{d,c,e\\}$.\n- Antichains of $P''$ not containing $d$: These are the antichains of the sub-poset $P''' = P'' \\setminus \\{d\\} = \\{a,b,c,e\\}$. The relations in $P'''$ are $a<c$ and $b<e$. Note that $\\{a,c\\}$ and $\\{b,e\\}$ are disjoint sets of elements, and there are no relations between them. Thus, $P'''$ is the disjoint union of two two-element chains $P_a=\\{a<c\\}$ and $P_b=\\{b<e\\}$. The number of antichains of a disjoint union of posets is the product of the number of antichains of each poset.\nThe antichains of $P_a=\\{a<c\\}$ are $\\emptyset, \\{a\\}, \\{c\\}$. There are $3$ of them.\nThe antichains of $P_b=\\{b<e\\}$ are $\\emptyset, \\{b\\}, \\{e\\}$. There are $3$ of them.\nTherefore, $N(P''') = N(P_a) \\times N(P_b) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nSo, $N(P'') = 4 (\\text{containing } d) + 9 (\\text{not containing } d) = 13$.\n\nNow we can calculate $N(P')$.\n$N(P') = 1 (\\text{containing } f,g) + 2 (\\text{containing } f, \\neg g) + 4 (\\text{containing } g, \\neg f) + 13 (\\text{containing } \\neg f, \\neg g) = 20$.\n\nFinally, we calculate $N(P)$.\n$N(P) = 1 + N(P') = 1 + 20 = 21$.\n\nThe number of order-preserving maps from $P$ to $C_2$ is equal to the number of antichains of $P$, which is $21$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{21}$$"}]}
