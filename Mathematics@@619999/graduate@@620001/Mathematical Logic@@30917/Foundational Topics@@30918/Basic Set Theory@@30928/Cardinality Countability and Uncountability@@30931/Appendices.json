It is a standard, well-posed question in foundational mathematics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- **Verdict:** The problem is **valid**.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe standard definition of equipotence (having the same cardinality) between two sets $A$ and $B$ is the existence of a bijection between them. A function $f \\colon A \\to B$ is a bijection if it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). We denote this relation by $A \\sim B$. We must now verify if this relation is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets, $V$, using only ZF axioms. An equivalence relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.\n\n1.  **Reflexivity:** For any set $A$, we must show $A \\sim A$.\n    We need a bijection from $A$ to itself. The identity function, $id_A \\colon A \\to A$, is defined by $id_A(a) = a$ for all $a \\in A$.\n    -   **Injectivity:** If $id_A(a_1) = id_A(a_2)$, then by definition $a_1 = a_2$. So $id_A$ is injective.\n    -   **Surjectivity:** For any $y \\in A$, we can choose $x=y \\in A$, and we have $id_A(x) = id_A(y) = y$. So $id_A$ is surjective.\n    Since $id_A$ is both injective and surjective, it is a bijection. Therefore, $A \\sim A$. This proof does not require AC.\n\n2.  **Symmetry:** If $A \\sim B$, we must show $B \\sim A$.\n    The premise $A \\sim B$ means there exists a bijection $f \\colon A \\to B$. We need to construct a bijection from $B$ to $A$.\n    Consider the inverse relation $f^{-1} = \\{ \\langle b, a \\rangle : \\langle a, b \\rangle \\in f \\}$.\n    -   $f^{-1}$ is a function from $B$ to $A$: For any $b \\in B$, because $f$ is surjective, there exists at least one $a \\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$. Because $f$ is injective, this $a$ is unique. Thus, for every $b \\in B$, there is exactly one $a \\in A$ such that $\\langle a,b \\rangle \\in f$, which means there is exactly one $a$ such that $\\langle b,a \\rangle \\in f^{-1}$. This shows $f^{-1}$ is a well-defined function $f^{-1} \\colon B \\to A$.\n    -   $f^{-1}$ is a bijection: The inverse of any bijection is also a bijection. To be explicit:\n        -   **Injectivity:** If $f^{-1}(b_1) = f^{-1}(b_2) = a$, then by definition of inverse, $f(a) = b_1$ and $f(a) = b_2$. Since $f$ is a function, $b_1 = b_2$.\n        -   **Surjectivity:** For any $a \\in A$, let $b = f(a)$. This $b$ exists since $f$ is a function defined on all of $A$. Then $f^{-1}(b) = a$.\n    Thus, $f^{-1}$ is a bijection from $B$ to $A$, which means $B \\sim A$. This proof does not require AC.\n\n3.  **Transitivity:** If $A \\sim B$ and $B \\sim C$, we must show $A \\sim C$.\n    The premises mean there exist bijections $f \\colon A \\to B$ and $g \\colon B \\to C$. We need to construct a bijection from $A$ to $C$.\n    Consider the composition of functions $g \\circ f \\colon A \\to C$, defined by $(g \\circ f)(a) = g(f(a))$.\n    -   The composition of two bijections is a bijection. To be explicit:\n        -   **Injectivity:** Suppose $(g \\circ f)(a_1) = (g \\circ f)(a_2)$, which means $g(f(a_1)) = g(f(a_2))$. Since $g$ is injective, we must have $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$. Since $f$ is injective, we must have $a_1 = a_2$.\n        -   **Surjectivity:** Let $c$ be an arbitrary element of $C$. Since $g$ is surjective, there exists a $b \\in B$ such that $g(b) = c$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exists an $a \\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$. Then $(g \\circ f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b) = c$.\n    Thus, $g \\circ f$ is a bijection from $A$ to $C$, which means $A \\sim C$. This proof does not require AC.\n\nThe relation of equipotence, defined by the existence of a bijection, is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets, and this is provable in ZF without any appeal to AC.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Two sets $A$ and $B$ are equipotent if there exists a bijection $f \\colon A \\to B$. Writing $A \\sim B$ to mean that there exists such an $f$, the relation $\\sim$ on $V$ is an equivalence relation: it is reflexive because the identity $id_A \\colon A \\to A$ given by $id_A = \\{ \\langle a,a \\rangle : a \\in A \\}$ is a bijection; it is symmetric because if $f \\colon A \\to B$ is a bijection, then the inverse relation $f^{-1} = \\{ \\langle b,a \\rangle : \\langle a,b \\rangle \\in f \\}$ is a bijection $B \\to A$; and it is transitive because if $f \\colon A \\to B$ and $g \\colon B \\to C$ are bijections, then the composition $g \\circ f = \\{ \\langle a,c \\rangle : \\exists b \\in B \\, ( \\langle a,b \\rangle \\in f \\wedge \\langle b,c \\rangle \\in g ) \\}$ is a bijection $A \\to C$. This requires no appeal to $AC$.**\nThis option provides the standard definition of equipotence. It then correctly outlines the proofs for reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, based on the properties of the identity function, the inverse of a bijection, and the composition of bijections, respectively. It also correctly states that these proofs are valid in ZF and do not require the Axiom of Choice. The set-theoretic formulations of the functions are also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Two sets $A$ and $B$ are equipotent if there exist injections $A \\hookrightarrow B$ and $B \\hookrightarrow A$. The corresponding relation is an equivalence relation if and only if one assumes $AC$; without $AC$, transitivity may fail.**\nThis definition invokes the Cantor–Schröder–Bernstein theorem, which states that mutual injection implies the existence of a bijection. This theorem is provable in ZF without AC. The relation defined by mutual injection is indeed an equivalence relation in ZF. Reflexivity (the identity is an injection) and symmetry (the definition is symmetric) are trivial. Transitivity holds because if $f_1 \\colon A \\hookrightarrow B$ and $f_2 \\colon B \\hookrightarrow C$ are injections, their composition $f_2 \\circ f_1 \\colon A \\hookrightarrow C$ is an injection. This establishes transitivity for the \"less-than-or-equal-to in cardinality\" relation, which is sufficient here. The option incorrectly claims this requires AC and that transitivity may fail without it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Two sets $A$ and $B$ are equipotent if there exists a surjection $A \\twoheadrightarrow B$. This relation is not symmetric in general, so equipotence is not an equivalence relation on $V$, which shows that there is no natural equivalence expressing “same size.”**\nThis option proposes defining equipotence by the existence of a surjection. As it correctly notes, this relation is not symmetric. For example, if $\\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers and $\\{0\\}$ is a singleton set, there is a surjection from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\{0\\}$, but no surjection from $\\{0\\}$ to $\\mathbb{N}$. Therefore, this is not an equivalence relation. However, the conclusion \"which shows that there is no natural equivalence expressing 'same size'\" is a non-sequitur. The failure of one proposed definition does not rule out the existence of a successful one, such as the standard definition given in option A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Two sets $A$ and $B$ are equipotent if there exists a bijection $A \\to B$, but it is not meaningful in $ZF$ to call this an equivalence relation “on the class of all sets,” because $V$ is a proper class and the collection of all such pairs $\\langle A,B \\rangle$ is not a set; thus one must restrict to a fixed set-sized universe to formulate equivalence.**\nThis option raises a subtle point regarding proper classes. In formal ZF, a relation is a set of ordered pairs. Since the class of all sets $V$ is a proper class, not a set, the collection of all pairs $\\langle A, B \\rangle$ such that $A \\sim B$ cannot be a set. However, it is standard mathematical practice to speak of relations on proper classes, where the \"relation\" is understood as a logical formula with two free variables, $\\Phi(x, y)$. The properties of an equivalence relation (reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity) can then be proven as metatheorems about this formula within ZF. The claim that it is \"not meaningful\" is an overstatement that contradicts common usage and understanding in set theory. The concept is perfectly meaningful and provably has the properties of an equivalence relation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Equipotence is an equivalence relation defined by the existence of a bijection $A \\to B$, but symmetry requires the Cantor–Schröder–Bernstein theorem to produce a bijection in the reverse direction, since an inverse need not exist in $ZF$ without $AC$.**\nThis option makes several false claims. The proof of symmetry does not require the Cantor–Schröder–Bernstein (CSB) theorem. As shown in the derivation above, symmetry follows directly from the fact that the inverse of any bijection exists and is itself a bijection. The CSB theorem is used to construct a bijection from two injections, which is a different problem. Furthermore, the claim that an \"inverse need not exist in ZF without AC\" is false in this context. The inverse of a *bijection* is always well-defined and exists in ZF. The issue with AC is related to finding a right-inverse for a *surjection*, which is not relevant here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2969690"}, {"introduction": "Having established a formal tool for comparing set sizes, we now explore a truly profound application that delineates the boundary between countable and uncountable infinities.

An equivalent characterization, given in the problem, is that a set $S$ is countable if there is a surjection from $\\mathbb{N}$ onto $S$. Another equivalent is that there is an injection from $S$ into $\\mathbb{N}$ (or any other known countable set).\n\n1.  Let $\\Sigma$ be the fixed finite alphabet used to write the descriptions of Turing machines.\n2.  The set of all finite-length strings over $\\Sigma$ is denoted $\\Sigma^*$. This set is countable. We can list its elements by first listing all strings of length $0$, then all strings of length $1$, then length $2$, and so on. Since for any length $k$, the set of strings $\\Sigma^k$ is finite, this procedure creates an enumeration of all strings in $\\Sigma^*$.\n3.  Each Turing machine corresponds to at least one finite string in $\\Sigma^*$. The set of all possible Turing machines, let us denote it $\\mathcal{T}$, is therefore in a one-to-one correspondence with a subset of $\\Sigma^*$. As a subset of a countable set, the set of all Turing machines $\\mathcal{T}$ is countable.\n4.  By the definition of a computable real number, for each $x \\in C$, there exists at least one Turing machine $M \\in \\mathcal{T}$ that computes it.\n5.  This establishes a relationship between the countable set of Turing machines and the set of computable reals $C$. More formally, let $\\mathcal{T}_{real} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ be the subset of Turing machines that compute real numbers according to the specified rule. $\\mathcal{T}_{real}$ is also countable. There exists a surjection $\\phi: \\mathcal{T}_{real} \\to C$ that maps each such Turing machine to the real number it computes.\n6.  Since $\\mathcal{T}_{real}$ is countable, there exists a surjection $g: \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathcal{T}_{real}$. The composition of surjections $\\phi \\circ g : \\mathbb{N} \\to C$ is also a surjection.\n7.  According to the problem's definition, the existence of a surjection from $\\mathbb{N}$ to $C$ means that $C$ is a countable set. This validates claim (i).\n\n**Justification for Claim (ii):**\n1.  A fundamental result in set theory, proven by Cantor's diagonal argument, is that the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$ is $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, while the cardinality of any countable set (like $C$) is at most $\\aleph_0$.\n2.  We have $|C| \\le \\aleph_0$ and $|\\mathbb{R}| = \\mathfrak{c}$. The continuum hypothesis is not needed; it is a theorem of ZFC that $\\aleph_0 < \\mathfrak{c}$.\n3.  The set of uncomputable real numbers is the set difference $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus C$.\n4.  If a countable set is removed from an uncountable set, the remaining set is still uncountable. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus C$ were countable. Then $\\mathbb{R} = C \\cup (\\mathbb{R} \\setminus C)$ would be the union of two countable sets. The union of two countable sets is countable, which would imply $\\mathbb{R}$ is countable. This is a contradiction.\n5.  Therefore, the set of uncomputable reals $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus C$ must be uncountable. Its cardinality is $|\\mathbb{R} \\setminus C| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n6.  Since the set of computable numbers $C$ is countable and the set of uncomputable numbers $\\mathbb{R} \\setminus C$ is uncountable, we say that \"almost all\" real numbers, in the sense of cardinality, are uncomputable. This validates claim (ii).\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. There are only countably many finite strings over a fixed finite alphabet. Each Turing machine is such a finite string, and each computable real admits at least one Turing machine that computes a fast Cauchy name for it. Hence the set of computable reals injects into a countable set (the set of codes of Turing machines), and is therefore countable.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly lays out the argument for claim (i). The set of all Turing machine descriptions (finite strings) is countable. The set of computable reals $C$ is \"generated\" by this countable set. The statement that \"$C$ injects into a countable set\" is a valid way to establish its countability. For each $x \\in C$, one can choose a canonical Turing machine that computes it (e.g., the one with the lexicographically first description), defining an injection from $C$ to the countable set of Turing machine codes. Alternatively, as reasoned above, there is a surjection from the countable set of relevant Turing machines to $C$. Both arguments prove countability. The reasoning is sound and directly addresses claim (i). The term \"fast Cauchy name\" is a standard way to refer to the provided definition where $\\lvert x-q_n \\rvert \\le 2^{-n}$.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The set $[0,1]\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable by Cantor’s diagonal argument. Since the computable reals form a countable set, their complement in $[0,1]$ (the uncomputable reals in $[0,1]$) must be uncountable. Hence almost all reals by cardinality are uncomputable.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly argues for claim (ii), taking the result of claim (i) as a premise (\"Since the computable reals form a countable set...\"). It correctly states that $[0,1]$ (and thus $\\mathbb{R}$) is uncountable. It then uses the correct set-theoretic argument that an uncountable set minus a countable set remains uncountable. Since the set of uncomputable reals within just $[0,1]$ is already uncountable, the entire set of uncomputable reals is definitely uncountable. This directly supports the conclusion that \"almost all reals by cardinality are uncomputable.\" The reasoning is sound and, combined with an argument for claim (i) (like option A), provides a complete justification.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. There are uncountably many programming languages, so there must be uncountably many programs; consequently, the set of computable reals is uncountable.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the premise \"There are uncountably many programming languages\" is not standard and highly contestable. Any programming language with a finite specification can be described by a finite string, making the set of all such languages countable. Second, even if one accepted the premise, the set of all *programs* (which are finite strings of text) written in a countable collection of languages is still a countable set (a countable union of countable sets). Third, the final conclusion that the set of computable reals is uncountable is factually wrong and contradicts claim (i).\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Because the computable reals contain the rationals $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, the set of computable reals is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$; therefore, it is uncountable.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option commits a logical fallacy. While the premises are true (the set of computable numbers $C$ contains the rationals $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$, and therefore $C$ is also dense in $\\mathbb{R}$), the conclusion \"therefore, it is uncountable\" does not follow. A set being dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ has no bearing on its cardinality. The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ itself is the canonical counterexample: it is dense in $\\mathbb{R}$ but is countable. The set of computable reals is another such example.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Since the computable reals have Lebesgue measure zero in $[0,1]$, it follows that almost all reals in the cardinality sense are uncomputable.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This option introduces a true but irrelevant fact to reach the conclusion. It is true that the set of computable reals, being countable, has a Lebesgue measure of $0$. The phrase \"almost all\" is used in both measure theory (meaning \"except on a set of measure zero\") and cardinality theory (meaning \"except on a set of lower cardinality\"). This option conflates the two meanings. A set having measure zero does not imply anything about its uncountability. For instance, the Cantor set is uncountable but has Lebesgue measure zero. Therefore, one cannot conclude from \"measure zero\" that the complement is uncountable. The argument must be made on the basis of cardinality alone, as in option B.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOptions A and B together provide a complete and correct justification for both claims. Option A establishes that the set of computable reals is countable. Option B uses this fact, along with the uncountability of the real numbers, to show that the set of uncomputable reals is uncountable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2969691"}]}
