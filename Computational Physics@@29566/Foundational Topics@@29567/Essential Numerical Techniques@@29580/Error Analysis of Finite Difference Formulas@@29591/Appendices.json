It is a well-posed problem in computational mathematics that requires a rigorous derivation. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe local truncation error, which we will denote as $E_{LT}(h)$, is the difference between the finite difference approximation and the exact derivative it approximates:\n$$\nE_{LT}(h) = \\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0-h)}{2h} - f'(x_0)\n$$\nTo analyze this error, we employ Taylor's theorem to expand $f(x_0+h)$ and $f(x_0-h)$ around the point $x_0$. Assuming $f(x)$ is sufficiently smooth, we can write the expansions to a high order.\n$$\nf(x_0+h) = f(x_0) + h f'(x_0) + \\frac{h^2}{2!} f''(x_0) + \\frac{h^3}{3!} f'''(x_0) + \\frac{h^4}{4!} f^{(4)}(x_0) + \\frac{h^5}{5!} f^{(5)}(x_0) + \\dots\n$$\n$$\nf(x_0-h) = f(x_0) - h f'(x_0) + \\frac{h^2}{2!} f''(x_0) - \\frac{h^3}{3!} f'''(x_0) + \\frac{h^4}{4!} f^{(4)}(x_0) - \\frac{h^5}{5!} f^{(5)}(x_0) + \\dots\n$$\nSubtracting the second expansion from the first eliminates all even-powered terms in $h$:\n$$\nf(x_0+h) - f(x_0-h) = 2h f'(x_0) + 2\\frac{h^3}{3!} f'''(x_0) + 2\\frac{h^5}{5!} f^{(5)}(x_0) + 2\\frac{h^7}{7!} f^{(7)}(x_0) + \\dots\n$$\nDividing by $2h$ gives the expression for the finite difference approximation:\n$$\n\\frac{f(x_0+h) - f(x_0-h)}{2h} = f'(x_0) + \\frac{h^2}{3!} f'''(x_0) + \\frac{h^4}{5!} f^{(5)}(x_0) + \\frac{h^6}{7!} f^{(7)}(x_0) + \\dots\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the local truncation error, we obtain its series expansion in powers of $h$:\n$$\nE_{LT}(h) = \\left( f'(x_0) + \\frac{h^2}{6} f'''(x_0) + \\frac{h^4}{120} f^{(5)}(x_0) + O(h^6) \\right) - f'(x_0)\n$$\n$$\nE_{LT}(h) = \\frac{h^2}{6} f'''(x_0) + \\frac{h^4}{120} f^{(5)}(x_0) + O(h^6)\n$$\nThe leading nonzero term in the truncation error is typically $\\frac{h^2}{6} f'''(x_0)$, which shows that the centered difference formula is second-order accurate, i.e., $O(h^2)$.\n\nThe problem requires us to choose a specific function $f(x)=x^n$ and a point $x_0=0$ to eliminate this leading error term. The condition for elimination is:\n$$\nf'''(x_0) = 0\n$$\nAdditionally, we are given a constraint: \"the next higher odd derivative at $x_0$ is nonzero\". The next term in the error series involves the next higher odd derivative, $f^{(5)}(x_0)$. Thus, the second condition is:\n$$\nf^{(5)}(x_0) \\neq 0\n$$\nWe must find the smallest integer $n \\geq 1$ for the function $f(x) = x^n$ at $x_0=0$ that satisfies both conditions.\n\nLet us analyze the derivatives of $f(x) = x^n$ at $x=0$. The $k$-th derivative is:\n$$\nf^{(k)}(x) = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!} x^{n-k} \\quad \\text{for } k \\leq n\n$$\nand $f^{(k)}(x) = 0$ for $k > n$.\nAt $x_0=0$, the derivative is nonzero only if the power of $x$ is zero, which means $n-k=0$, or $n=k$. Specifically:\n$$\nf^{(k)}(0) = \\begin{cases} n! & \\text{if } n=k \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } n \\neq k \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe first condition, $f'''(0)=0$, requires that $n \\neq 3$. Since $f'''(x) = n(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3}$, for this derivative to be zero at $x=0$, we must have $n-3 > 0$, i.e., $n > 3$. Thus, possible values for $n$ are $4, 5, 6, \\dots$.\n\nThe second condition, $f^{(5)}(0) \\neq 0$, requires that $n=5$. If $n$ were any other integer, $f^{(5)}(0)$ would be zero.\n\nCombining both conditions, we need $n > 3$ and $n=5$. The smallest integer $n \\geq 1$ satisfying this is $n=5$. Therefore, the function is $f(x) = x^5$ and the point is $x_0=0$.\n\nNow we must compute the leading nonzero truncation error term, $E(h)$, for this specific case. With $f(x) = x^5$ and $x_0=0$, the general error expansion becomes:\n$$\nE_{LT}(h) = \\frac{h^2}{6} f'''(0) + \\frac{h^4}{120} f^{(5)}(0) + \\frac{h^6}{5040} f^{(7)}(0) + \\dots\n$$\nWe evaluate the necessary derivatives for $f(x)=x^5$ at $x_0=0$:\n-   $f'''(x) = 60x^2 \\implies f'''(0) = 0$.\n-   $f^{(4)}(x) = 120x \\implies f^{(4)}(0) = 0$.\n-   $f^{(5)}(x) = 120 \\implies f^{(5)}(0) = 120$.\n-   For any $k>5$, $f^{(k)}(x) = 0 \\implies f^{(k)}(0) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the error series:\n$$\nE_{LT}(h) = \\frac{h^2}{6} (0) + \\frac{h^4}{120} (120) + \\frac{h^6}{5040} (0) + \\dots\n$$\nAll terms beyond the $h^4$ term are zero because all higher derivatives are zero. Thus, the truncation error is exactly:\n$$\nE_{LT}(h) = h^4\n$$\nAlternatively, we can compute the error directly for $f(x)=x^5$ at $x_0=0$.\nThe finite difference approximation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{f(0+h) - f(0-h)}{2h} = \\frac{(h)^5 - (-h)^5}{2h} = \\frac{h^5 + h^5}{2h} = \\frac{2h^5}{2h} = h^4\n$$\nThe exact derivative is $f'(x) = 5x^4$. At $x_0=0$, the exact value is $f'(0) = 0$.\nThe error is the difference between the approximation and the exact value:\n$$\nE(h) = h^4 - 0 = h^4\n$$\nBy eliminating the $O(h^2)$ term, the method's accuracy at this specific point for this specific function has increased to fourth order, $O(h^4)$.
