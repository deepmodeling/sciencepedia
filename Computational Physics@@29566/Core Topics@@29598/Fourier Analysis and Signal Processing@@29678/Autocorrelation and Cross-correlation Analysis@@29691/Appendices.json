{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our hands-on exploration, we will tackle a classic signal processing problem: determining a system's response time to an external stimulus. Cross-correlation is the ideal mathematical tool for this task, as it systematically quantifies the similarity between an input signal and an output signal at various time lags. This first exercise [@problem_id:2374653] applies this principle to a concrete physical system from hydrology, where you will model a river's discharge rate in response to rainfall events. By finding the time lag that maximizes the cross-correlation, you will computationally estimate the characteristic response time of the watershed.", "problem": "You will implement a complete, runnable program that estimates the characteristic response time of a river system to rainfall by computing the discrete cross-correlation between a rainfall time series and a generated river discharge (runoff) time series. The program must construct the signals from first principles, apply scientifically sound preprocessing, and determine a single dominant response time for each test case. All computations should be expressed in purely mathematical and algorithmic terms, and all final reported times must be expressed in hours with two decimal places.\n\nThe physical setup is modeled as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system where the basin transforms rainfall into runoff through a causal impulse response. Discrete time is used with sampling interval $\\Delta t$ in hours, indexed by $n \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N-1\\}$ and time $t_n = n \\Delta t$. The rainfall sequence is $r[n]$ and the discharge sequence is $q[n]$. The discharge is generated by a discrete-time convolution with a physically meaningful, causal impulse response $h[k]$, optionally with a slow baseline trend $b(t)$ and a small deterministic sinusoidal perturbation $e(t)$:\n$$\nq[n] = \\Delta t \\sum_{m=0}^{n} h[m] \\, r[n-m] \\;+\\; b(t_n) \\;+\\; e(t_n).\n$$\nAll functions and parameters are given explicitly below; there is no randomness.\n\nYour program must:\n\n1. Construct $r[n]$ (rainfall) as a sum of non-overlapping rectangular pulses. Each pulse is specified by a tuple $(t_{\\mathrm{start}}, T_{\\mathrm{dur}}, I)$ in hours and millimeters per hour, meaning\n   $$\n   r[n] \\leftarrow r[n] + I \\quad \\text{for all } n \\text{ such that } t_{\\mathrm{start}} \\le n \\Delta t < t_{\\mathrm{dur}} + t_{\\mathrm{start}},\n   $$\n   and $r[n] \\leftarrow 0$ elsewhere initially. All $t_{\\mathrm{start}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{dur}}$ are exact multiples of $\\Delta t$, and $I \\ge 0$.\n\n2. Construct a causal impulse response $h[k]$ of one of the following forms:\n   - Single delayed exponential:\n     $$\n     h[k] = \\begin{cases}\n     \\alpha \\, \\dfrac{1}{\\tau} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{k \\Delta t - t_0}{\\tau}\\right), & k \\Delta t \\ge t_0,\\\\\n     0, & \\text{otherwise,}\n     \\end{cases}\n     $$\n     with scale $\\alpha > 0$, delay $t_0 > 0$, and time constant $\\tau > 0$.\n   - Mixture of delayed exponentials with weights $\\{w_i\\}$ summing to $1$:\n     $$\n     h[k] = \\sum_{i} \\begin{cases}\n     \\alpha \\, w_i \\, \\dfrac{1}{\\tau_i} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{k \\Delta t - t_{0,i}}{\\tau_i}\\right), & k \\Delta t \\ge t_{0,i},\\\\\n     0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n     \\end{cases}\n     $$\n\n3. Construct the slow baseline $b(t)$ and the deterministic sinusoid $e(t)$ as specified per case. For the baseline, use a linear function $b(t) = s \\, t$ with slope $s$ in millimeters per hour squared. For the sinusoid, use $e(t) = A \\sin\\!\\left( 2 \\pi \\, t / P \\right)$ with amplitude $A$ in millimeters per hour and period $P$ in hours.\n\n4. Preprocess $r[n]$ and $q[n]$ as follows:\n   - Remove the least-squares best-fit line $a t + b$ from each series independently (linear detrending over the full record), resulting in detrended series $\\tilde r[n]$ and $\\tilde q[n]$.\n   - Do not otherwise filter or smooth the data.\n\n5. For nonnegative integer lags $\\ell \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots,\\ell_{\\max}\\}$, compute the discrete, finite-sample, normalized cross-correlation between $\\tilde r[n]$ and $\\tilde q[n]$ at lag $\\ell$ as the Pearson correlation coefficient computed on the overlapping indices $\\{0,1,\\dots,N-\\ell-1\\}$. That is, for each $\\ell$, consider the pairs $\\{ (\\tilde r[n], \\tilde q[n+\\ell]) \\}$ with common index range, and compute the correlation coefficient using the definitions of sample covariance and sample standard deviations restricted to these overlapping samples. If the overlapping standard deviation of either series is zero at a particular lag, define the correlation at that lag to be zero.\n\n6. Define the characteristic response time $T^\\star$ as the nonnegative time lag that maximizes the normalized cross-correlation, i.e., let $\\ell^\\star = \\arg\\max_{0 \\le \\ell \\le \\ell_{\\max}} \\rho_{\\tilde r, \\tilde q}[\\ell]$, and set $T^\\star = \\ell^\\star \\Delta t$.\n\n7. Report $T^\\star$ for each test case in hours, rounded to two decimal places.\n\nYour program must implement the above steps and produce the final output as a single line containing the list of $T^\\star$ values for all test cases, formatted as a comma-separated list inside square brackets, for example, \"[8.00,6.50,5.00,20.00]\". There must be no extra whitespace or text.\n\nTest Suite (four cases). For each case, construct the data exactly as specified:\n\n- Case 1:\n  - Length $N = 256$, sampling interval $\\Delta t = 1.0$ hours.\n  - Rainfall pulses $(t_{\\mathrm{start}}, T_{\\mathrm{dur}}, I)$ in hours and millimeters per hour: $(20.0, 5.0, 10.0)$, $(100.0, 3.0, 6.0)$, $(170.0, 4.0, 8.0)$.\n  - Impulse response: single delayed exponential, with $t_0 = 8.0$ hours, $\\tau = 6.0$ hours, and $\\alpha = 0.5$.\n  - Baseline slope $s = 0.0$ millimeters per hour squared, sinusoid amplitude $A = 0.1$ millimeters per hour, sinusoid period $P = 64.0$ hours.\n  - Search lags $0 \\le \\ell \\le \\ell_{\\max}$ with $\\ell_{\\max}$ corresponding to $60.0$ hours (i.e., $\\ell_{\\max} = 60$ samples).\n\n- Case 2:\n  - Length $N = 300$, sampling interval $\\Delta t = 0.5$ hours.\n  - Rainfall pulses: $(20.0, 2.0, 5.0)$, $(50.0, 1.0, 8.0)$, $(90.0, 4.0, 6.0)$.\n  - Impulse response: single delayed exponential, with $t_0 = 6.0$ hours, $\\tau = 3.0$ hours, and $\\alpha = 0.5$.\n  - Baseline slope $s = 0.005$ millimeters per hour squared, sinusoid amplitude $A = 0.05$ millimeters per hour, sinusoid period $P = 10.0$ hours.\n  - Search lags $0 \\le \\ell \\le \\ell_{\\max}$ with $\\ell_{\\max}$ corresponding to $40.0$ hours (i.e., $\\ell_{\\max} = 80$ samples).\n\n- Case 3:\n  - Length $N = 256$, sampling interval $\\Delta t = 1.0$ hours.\n  - Rainfall pulses: $(30.0, 3.0, 12.0)$, $(60.0, 2.0, 9.0)$, $(200.0, 5.0, 7.0)$.\n  - Impulse response: mixture with two components. Weights $w_1 = 0.7$, $w_2 = 0.3$, delays $t_{0,1} = 5.0$ hours and $t_{0,2} = 15.0$ hours, time constants $\\tau_1 = 4.0$ hours and $\\tau_2 = 10.0$ hours, and overall scale $\\alpha = 0.8$.\n  - Baseline slope $s = 0.0$ millimeters per hour squared, sinusoid amplitude $A = 0.0$ millimeters per hour, sinusoid period $P$ arbitrary (unused since $A=0$).\n  - Search lags $0 \\le \\ell \\le \\ell_{\\max}$ with $\\ell_{\\max}$ corresponding to $50.0$ hours (i.e., $\\ell_{\\max} = 50$ samples).\n\n- Case 4:\n  - Length $N = 128$, sampling interval $\\Delta t = 1.0$ hours.\n  - Rainfall pulses: $(10.0, 5.0, 10.0)$, $(60.0, 3.0, 8.0)$.\n  - Impulse response: single delayed exponential, with $t_0 = 20.0$ hours, $\\tau = 8.0$ hours, and $\\alpha = 0.6$.\n  - Baseline slope $s = 0.002$ millimeters per hour squared, sinusoid amplitude $A = 0.05$ millimeters per hour, sinusoid period $P = 32.0$ hours.\n  - Search lags $0 \\le \\ell \\le \\ell_{\\max}$ with $\\ell_{\\max}$ corresponding to $40.0$ hours (i.e., $\\ell_{\\max} = 40$ samples).\n\nAnswer specification and units: For each case, compute $T^\\star$ in hours and round to two decimal places. The final program output must be a single line containing the list of these four values formatted exactly as a comma-separated list within square brackets (e.g., \"[8.00,6.00,5.00,20.00]\"). Angles are not used in this problem. Use hours as the time unit exclusively throughout and in the final output.", "solution": "We model the rainfall–runoff transformation as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system in discrete time. Let the sampling interval be $\\Delta t$ in hours, with time index $n \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N-1\\}$ and $t_n = n \\Delta t$. The rainfall series is $r[n]$, and the discharge series $q[n]$ is generated by a causal convolution with impulse response $h[k]$ plus low-frequency baseline $b(t)$ and small deterministic sinusoid $e(t)$:\n$$\nq[n] = \\Delta t \\sum_{m=0}^{n} h[m] \\, r[n-m] + b(t_n) + e(t_n).\n$$\nThis is the discrete counterpart to the continuous convolution $q(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h(s) r(t-s) \\, ds$ under the Riemann sum approximation with step $\\Delta t$.\n\nFoundational definitions. The finite-sample cross-covariance at lag $\\ell \\ge 0$ over the overlapping segment is defined as\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\ell}(\\tilde r,\\tilde q) = \\frac{1}{M_{\\ell}} \\sum_{n=0}^{M_{\\ell}-1} \\left(\\tilde r[n] - \\overline{\\tilde r}_{\\ell}\\right) \\left(\\tilde q[n+\\ell] - \\overline{\\tilde q}_{\\ell}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\ell} = N - \\ell$, $\\overline{\\tilde r}_{\\ell} = \\frac{1}{M_{\\ell}} \\sum_{n=0}^{M_{\\ell}-1} \\tilde r[n]$, and $\\overline{\\tilde q}_{\\ell} = \\frac{1}{M_{\\ell}} \\sum_{n=0}^{M_{\\ell}-1} \\tilde q[n+\\ell]$. The corresponding sample standard deviations over the overlapping segment are\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\tilde r,\\ell} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{M_{\\ell}} \\sum_{n=0}^{M_{\\ell}-1} \\left(\\tilde r[n] - \\overline{\\tilde r}_{\\ell}\\right)^2}, \\quad\n\\sigma_{\\tilde q,\\ell} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{M_{\\ell}} \\sum_{n=0}^{M_{\\ell}-1} \\left(\\tilde q[n+\\ell] - \\overline{\\tilde q}_{\\ell}\\right)^2}.\n$$\nThe normalized cross-correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient) at lag $\\ell$ is\n$$\n\\rho_{\\tilde r,\\tilde q}[\\ell] =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{\\operatorname{Cov}_{\\ell}(\\tilde r,\\tilde q)}{\\sigma_{\\tilde r,\\ell} \\, \\sigma_{\\tilde q,\\ell}}, & \\sigma_{\\tilde r,\\ell} > 0 \\text{ and } \\sigma_{\\tilde q,\\ell} > 0, \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nPreprocessing by linear detrending. Because hydrologic discharge often contains slow drifts (baseflow changes) and rainfall sequences can have low-frequency bias depending on the event definitions, we remove the least-squares best-fit line $a t + b$ from each series across the full record to form $\\tilde r[n]$ and $\\tilde q[n]$. For a series $x[n]$ with time vector $t_n = n \\Delta t$, the least-squares fit solves\n$$\n\\min_{a,b} \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\left(x[n] - (a t_n + b)\\right)^2,\n$$\nwhose closed-form solution arises from normal equations or can be computed via linear least squares, and then we define $\\tilde x[n] = x[n] - (a t_n + b)$. This removes the linear trend and centers the data approximately around zero, stabilizing the correlation estimation.\n\nWhy the cross-correlation peak gives the response time. For an LTI system with $q = h * r$ (causal convolution), the cross-correlation between input $r$ and output $q$ satisfies the well-known relation (under assumptions of wide-sense stationarity of $r$) \n$$\nR_{rq}(\\tau) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} r(t) \\, q(t+\\tau) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h(s) \\, R_{rr}(\\tau - s) \\, ds = (h * R_{rr})(\\tau),\n$$\nthe convolution of the autocorrelation of $r$ with the impulse response $h$. In discrete time, the analogous relation holds with sums. Since $R_{rr}(\\tau)$ is typically maximized near $\\tau = 0$ for signals whose autocorrelation decays away from zero (e.g., finite pulses, approximately uncorrelated structure beyond short lags), the convolution $(h * R_{rr})(\\tau)$ is maximized near the location where $h$ carries its largest mass. For the delayed exponential $h(t) \\propto u(t-t_0) \\exp(- (t-t_0)/\\tau)$, the impulse response attains its maximum at $t = t_0$ and decays thereafter. Therefore, the peak of $R_{rq}(\\tau)$ is near $\\tau \\approx t_0$, and the corresponding discrete cross-correlation coefficient $\\rho_{\\tilde r,\\tilde q}[\\ell]$ should be maximized around the discrete lag closest to $t_0/\\Delta t$, provided detrending removes low-frequency biases. For mixtures of exponentials, the peak is near the largest weighted early delay if the early component dominates, which is consistent with the physical interpretation of a dominant fast pathway contributing most to the discharge.\n\nAlgorithmic design. We follow these steps for each case:\n1. Build $r[n]$ from the specified rectangular pulses by adding the specified intensity over indices where $t_{\\mathrm{start}} \\le n \\Delta t < t_{\\mathrm{start}} + T_{\\mathrm{dur}}$ for each pulse.\n2. Build $h[k]$ using the specified parameters and formulae for either a single delayed exponential or a mixture.\n3. Build $b(t) = s t$ and $e(t) = A \\sin(2 \\pi t / P)$ using the specified $s$, $A$, and $P$.\n4. Compute $q[n] = \\Delta t \\sum_{m=0}^{n} h[m] r[n-m] + b(t_n) + e(t_n)$, with $h[m] = 0$ for $m \\ge N$ implicitly by truncation.\n5. Detrend both $r[n]$ and $q[n]$ by removing the least-squares best-fit line across the whole record, yielding $\\tilde r[n]$ and $\\tilde q[n]$.\n6. For integer lags $0 \\le \\ell \\le \\ell_{\\max}$, compute $\\rho_{\\tilde r,\\tilde q}[\\ell]$ as the Pearson correlation coefficient over the overlapping indices $n \\in \\{0,\\dots,N-\\ell-1\\}$ using the definitions of sample covariance and standard deviations. If either standard deviation is zero for a lag, define the correlation to be zero at that lag.\n7. Find $\\ell^\\star = \\arg\\max_{0 \\le \\ell \\le \\ell_{\\max}} \\rho_{\\tilde r,\\tilde q}[\\ell]$, and compute $T^\\star = \\ell^\\star \\Delta t$.\n8. Round each $T^\\star$ to two decimal places and output the four values in the specified single-line list format.\n\nExpected qualitative outcomes for the test suite:\n- Case $1$ uses a single delayed exponential with $t_0 = 8.0$ hours and moderate decay $\\tau = 6.0$ hours. The correlation peak is expected near $T^\\star \\approx 8.0$ hours.\n- Case $2$ has $\\Delta t = 0.5$ hours and $t_0 = 6.0$ hours; detrending is important due to the baseline slope. The correlation peak is expected near $T^\\star \\approx 6.0$ hours.\n- Case $3$ uses a mixture of delays $t_{0,1} = 5.0$ hours and $t_{0,2} = 15.0$ hours with weights $w_1 = 0.7$ and $w_2 = 0.3$. The earlier pathway dominates, so the peak should be near $T^\\star \\approx 5.0$ hours.\n- Case $4$ uses a single delayed exponential with a larger delay $t_0 = 20.0$ hours; the correlation peak should occur near $T^\\star \\approx 20.0$ hours.\n\nThe program implements these steps exactly and prints the computed $T^\\star$ values in hours, each rounded to two decimals, as a single bracketed, comma-separated list.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef build_rainfall(N, dt, pulses):\n    \"\"\"\n    Build rainfall r[n] as sum of rectangular pulses.\n    pulses: list of tuples (t_start_hours, duration_hours, intensity_mm_per_h),\n    all t_start and duration are multiples of dt.\n    \"\"\"\n    r = np.zeros(N, dtype=float)\n    for t_start, duration, intensity in pulses:\n        start_idx = int(round(t_start / dt))\n        width = int(round(duration / dt))\n        end_idx = start_idx + width\n        start_idx = max(0, start_idx)\n        end_idx = min(N, end_idx)\n        if end_idx > start_idx:\n            r[start_idx:end_idx] += intensity\n    return r\n\ndef build_kernel_single(N, dt, t0, tau, alpha):\n    \"\"\"\n    Single delayed exponential kernel: h[k] = alpha * (1/tau) * exp(-(k*dt -

The detected period is the smallest $k \\in \\{1,2,\\dots,K\\}$ that is a local maximum and satisfies $\\rho(k) \\ge \\theta$. If no such $k$ exists, report a detected period of $0$.\n\nImplement a program that, for each parameter set in the test suite below, generates the specified sequence $\\{x_n\\}$, computes $\\rho(k)$ for $0 \\le k \\le K$, determines whether the sequence passes the whiteness test, and detects a short period according to the rule above.

Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $\"[[\\text{True},0],[\\text{False},64]]\"$).\n\nTest suite (each case specifies how to generate $\\{x_n\\}$ and the parameters $N$, $K$, $\\tau$, $\\theta$):\n\n- Case $1$ (long-period multiplicative linear congruential generator): Define integers $m$, $a$, $c$, and $s_0$ by $m = 2^{31}-1$, $a = 16807$, $c = 0$, $s_0 = 12345$.

Since the period detection threshold $\\theta = 0.9$ cannot be met, the detected period is 0.\n\n4.  **Autocorrelation Calculation**: If $\\sigma^2 > 0$, the normalized sample autocorrelation $\\rho(k)$ is computed for lags $k$ from $1$ to $K$ using the provided formula:\n    $$\n    \\rho(k) = \\frac{1}{(N-k)\\,\\sigma^2}\\sum_{n=0}^{N-k-1} (x_n - \\mu)(x_{n+k} - \\mu).\n    $$\n    This measures the correlation between the sequence and a shifted version of itself.\n\n5.  **Whiteness Test**: The sequence is tested for whiteness by finding the maximum absolute autocorrelation value for all non-zero lags up to $K$.

If such a lag is found, it is reported as the period; otherwise, the period is 0.\n\nThis algorithm is applied to all three cases.

It requires the simulation of a cellular automaton, specifically Conway’s Game of Life, and a subsequent spatial statistical analysis of the resulting patterns using autocorrelation methods. The problem is scientifically grounded, mathematically consistent, and all parameters and definitions are provided with sufficient precision. It is therefore deemed valid. We proceed with the derivation of the solution from first principles.\n\nThe core of the problem consists of two main parts: first, the dynamical simulation of the binary field $X_t(i,j)$, and second, the calculation of the spatial correlation length $L_t$ from a snapshot of this field.\n\n**Part 1: Simulation of Conway’s Game of Life**\n\nThe system is a binary field $X_t(i,j) \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ on an $N \\times N$ lattice with periodic boundary conditions. The state of a cell at time $t+1$ depends on its own state $X_t(i,j)$ and the sum of its eight neighbors, $S_t(i,j)$, at time $t$. The neighbor sum at site $(i,j)$ can be expressed as a discrete circular convolution:\n$$\nS_t(i,j) = \\sum_{k,l \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}, (k,l)\\neq(0,0)} X_t(i+k \\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ N, \\, j+l \\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ N)\n$$\nThis operation is efficiently computed by convolving the field $X_t$ with a kernel $K$:\n$$\nK = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, we have $S_t = X_t * K$, where $*$ denotes a two-dimensional circular convolution. This is numerically implemented using standard library functions that handle periodic boundary conditions.\n\nThe update rules are applied simultaneously to all cells $(i,j)$:\n1.  A live cell ($X_t(i,j) = 1$) survives to the next generation if its neighbor sum $S_t(i,j)$ is $2$ or $3$. This can be written as the logical condition: $(X_t(i,j) = 1) \\land (S_t(i,j) \\in \\{2, 3\\})$.\n2.  A dead cell ($X_t(i,j) = 0$) becomes alive (is born) if its neighbor sum $S_t(i,j)$ is exactly $3$. This is the logical condition: $(X_t(i,j) = 0) \\land (S_t(i,j) = 3)$.\n\nThe state at the next time step, $X_{t+1}(i,j)$, is the logical OR of these two conditions. The simulation proceeds by iteratively applying this update rule for the required number of steps $T$.\n\n**Part 2: Autocorrelation Analysis and Correlation Length**\n\nThe objective is to quantify the \"clumpiness\" of the pattern $X_t$ at specific times. This is achieved by computing a characteristic length scale from the spatial autocorrelation function.\n\nFirst, we define the zero-mean fluctuation field $f_t(i,j)$ by subtracting the spatial mean $\\mu_t = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i,j} X_t(i,j)$:\n$$\nf_t(i,j) = X_t(i,j) - \\mu_t\n$$\nThe autocovariance function $R_t(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ measures the covariance of the field with a spatially shifted version of itself. The definition given is for a periodic domain:\n$$\nR_t(\\Delta x,\\Delta y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_t(i,j)\\, f_t(i+\\Delta x \\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ N, \\, j+\\Delta y \\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ N)\n$$\nThis is a circular autocorrelation. A direct, brute-force computation would scale as $O(N^4)$, which is prohibitive for the given lattice sizes. We must employ a more efficient method based on the Wiener-Khinchin theorem for discrete signals. The theorem states that the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the autocorrelation of a signal is equal to its power spectral density (the squared magnitude of the signal's DFT). Let $\\mathcal{F}$ denote the 2D DFT. The circular autocorrelation can be computed as:\n$$\nR_t = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\left[ |\\mathcal{F}[f_t]|^2 \\right]\n$$\nwhere $|z|^2$ is the squared magnitude. This reduces the computational complexity to that of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, which is $O(N^2 \\log N)$.\n\nThe autocovariance $R_t$ is then normalized to yield the autocorrelation function $C_t$:\n$$\nC_t(\\Delta x,\\Delta y) = \\frac{R_t(\\Delta x,\\Delta y)}{R_t(0,0)}\n$$\nThe denominator $R_t(0,0) = \\sum_{i,j} f_t(i,j)^2$ is the total variance of the field scaled by $N^2$. If $R_t(0,0)=0$, the field has zero variance (it is uniform), meaning $f_t(i,j)=0$ everywhere. In this case, there are no fluctuations to correlate, and $C_t(\\Delta x,\\Delta y)$ is defined to be $0$.\n\nTo obtain a single characteristic length, we first compute the isotropic (radially averaged) autocorrelation $c_t(r)$. This involves averaging $C_t(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ over annular shells $\\mathcal{S}_r$ of radius $r$. The distance $d(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ is the minimal Euclidean distance on the torus for a displacement $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$:\n$$\nd(\\Delta x,\\Delta y) = \\sqrt{\\min(|\\Delta x|, N-|\\Delta x|)^2 + \\min(|\\Delta y|, N-|\\Delta y|)^2}\n$$\nWe construct a grid of these distances corresponding to all possible lags $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$, where $\\Delta x, \\Delta y \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$. For each integer radius $r$ from $0$ to $R_{\\max} = \\lfloor \\sqrt{2} N/2 \\rfloor$, we identify all lags $(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ such that $r \\le d(\\Delta x, \\Delta y) < r+1$. The value $c_t(r)$ is the average of $C_t(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$ over these lags.\n\nFinally, the correlation length $L_t$ is defined as a weighted root-mean-square of the radial distance $r$, where the weights are the non-negative values of the isotropic autocorrelation $c_t(r)$ for $r \\ge 1$:\n$$\nL_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{r=1}^{R_{\\max}} r^2 \\, \\max(c_t(r),0)}{\\sum_{r=1}^{R_{\\max}} \\max(c_t(r),0)}}\n$$\nThe summation excludes $r=0$, as $c_t(0)=1$ is a trivial self-correlation. The use of $\\max(c_t(r),0)$ ensures that only positive correlations (indicating clustering or aggregation) contribute to the length scale, while anti-correlations are ignored. Edge cases where the denominator is zero (i.e., no positive correlations for $r \\ge 1$) result in $L_t = 0$, which is physically sensible.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, generate the initial state $X_0$ according to the specifications.\n2.  Create a list of simulation times to analyze: $t \\in \\{0, \\lfloor T/2 \\rfloor, T\\}$.\n3.  Simulate the Game of Life evolution from $t=0$ to $t=T$, storing the grid states for the required analysis times.\n4.  For each stored grid $X_t$:\n    a. Calculate the fluctuation field $f_t$.\n    b. If the variance of $X_t$ is zero, $L_t = 0$.\n    c. Otherwise, compute the autocovariance matrix $R_t$ using the FFT-based method.\n    d. Normalize $R_t$ to get the autocorrelation matrix $C_t$.\n    e. Pre-compute the grid of toroidal distances $d(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$.\n    f. Compute the radially-averaged autocorrelation $c_t(r)$ for $r \\in \\{0, \\dots, R_{\\max}\\}$ by binning the values of $C_t$ according to the distance grid.\n    g. Calculate the correlation length $L_t$ using the final formula, summing over $r \\in \\{1, \\dots, R_{\\max}\\}$.\n5.
