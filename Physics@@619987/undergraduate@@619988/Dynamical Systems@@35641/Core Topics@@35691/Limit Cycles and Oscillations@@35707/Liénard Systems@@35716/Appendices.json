The function $g(x)=x$ is continuous for all $x$. The function $f(x)$ is piecewise constant with jump discontinuities at $x=1$ and $x=-1$: $\\lim_{x\\to 1^{-}}f(x)=-1$ while $\\lim_{x\\to 1^{+}}f(x)=1$, and similarly at $x=-1$. Therefore $f$ is not continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, so condition (i) fails.\n\nSecond, condition (ii) requires $g$ to be odd and $g(x)>0$ for $x>0$. We have $g(-x)=-x=-g(x)$, hence $g$ is odd, and clearly $g(x)>0$ for all $x>0$, so (ii) holds.\n\nThird, condition (iii) requires $f$ to be even. Since $f$ depends only on $|x|$, we have $f(-x)=f(x)$ for all $x$, so (iii) holds.\n\nFourth, condition (iv) concerns the primitive $F(x)=\\int_{0}^{x}f(u)\\,du$.

Hence the positive zeros of $F$ are determined by the $x\\geq 0$ expressions: $F(x)=0$ gives $x=0$ or $x=2$, so there is exactly one positive root at $a=2$. Moreover, for $0<x<1$, $F(x)=-x<0$, and for $1<x<2$, $F(x)=x-2<0$, so $F(x)<0$ on $(0,2)$. For $x>2$, $F(x)=x-2>0$. Furthermore, for $x>a$, $F'(x)=f(x)=1\\geq 0$, so $F$ is non-decreasing on $(2,\\infty)$. Thus condition (iv) holds.\n\nIn summary, conditions (ii), (iii), and (iv) are satisfied, but condition (i) fails because $f$ is not continuous.
