Fixed points, denoted by $\\theta^*$, are the values of $\\theta$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $\\dot{\\theta} = 0$.\nSetting the governing equation to zero, we get:\n$$ \\sin(4\\theta^*) = 0 $$\nThe sine function is zero when its argument is an integer multiple of $\\pi$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$ 4\\theta^* = n\\pi $$\nwhere $n$ is an integer. Solving for $\\theta^*$, we get:\n$$ \\theta^* = \\frac{n\\pi}{4} $$\nWe are looking for distinct fixed points within the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. This means we need to find all integer values of $n$ such that $0 \\le \\frac{n\\pi}{4} < 2\\pi$.\nMultiplying the inequality by $\\frac{4}{\\pi}$, we get:\n$$ 0 \\le n < 8 $$\nThe possible integer values for $n$ are $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$.

For a one-dimensional system $\\dot{x} = f(x)$, the stability of a fixed point $x^*$ can be determined by linear stability analysis, which involves checking the sign of the derivative $f'(x^*)$.\n- If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the fixed point is stable.\n- If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the fixed point is unstable.\n- If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and higher-order derivatives or graphical analysis would be needed.\n\nIn our case, the function is $f(\\theta) = \\sin(4\\theta)$. Its derivative with respect to $\\theta$ is:\n$$ f'(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(\\sin(4\\theta)) = 4\\cos(4\\theta) $$\nWe need to evaluate this derivative at each fixed point $\\theta^* = \\frac{n\\pi}{4}$.\n$$ f'(\\theta^*) = 4\\cos\\left(4 \\cdot \\frac{n\\pi}{4}\\right) = 4\\cos(n\\pi) $$\nThe value of $\\cos(n\\pi)$ is $1$ if $n$ is an even integer and $-1$ if $n$ is an odd integer.\n\nLet's analyze the stability for even and odd values of $n$:\n\nCase 1: $n$ is even ($n = 0, 2, 4, 6$)\nFor these values of $n$, $\\cos(n\\pi) = 1$.\n$$ f'(\\theta^*) = 4(1) = 4 > 0 $$\nSince the derivative is positive, the corresponding fixed points are unstable.\nThe unstable fixed points are:\n- $n=0$: $\\theta^* = 0$\n- $n=2$: $\\theta^* = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n- $n=4$: $\\theta^* = \\pi$\n- $n=6$: $\\theta^* = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$\nThere are 4 unstable fixed points.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is odd ($n = 1, 3, 5, 7$)\nFor these values of $n$, $\\cos(n\\pi) = -1$.\n$$ f'(\\theta^*) = 4(-1) = -4 < 0 $$\nSince the derivative is negative, the corresponding fixed points are stable.\nThe stable fixed points are:\n- $n=1$: $\\theta^* = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n- $n=3$: $\\theta^* = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}$\n- $n=5$: $\\theta^* = \\frac{5\\pi}{4}$\n- $n=7$: $\\theta^* = \\frac{7\\pi}{4}$\nThere are 4 stable fixed points.\n\nIn summary, the system has a total of 8 fixed points in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$, with 4 of them being stable and 4 being unstable.
