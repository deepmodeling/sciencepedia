In a planar autonomous system, any simple closed periodic orbit has index $+1$, and the index of the vector field along that closed curve equals the sum of the indices of all equilibria contained in its interior. Therefore, any periodic orbit must enclose equilibria whose total index is $+1$.\n\nStep 3: Apply the uniqueness of the equilibrium. The system has exactly one equilibrium, at $(1,1)$, with index $-1$. A periodic orbit cannot enclose no equilibria (the index would be $0$, contradicting the required $+1$), and if it encloses the unique equilibrium, the enclosed index would be $-1$, again contradicting the required $+1$. Therefore, no periodic orbit can exist anywhere in the plane for this system.\n\nConclusion: No periodic solutions exist.
