Let $f(x,y) = x^{2}y + y^{3} + x$ and $g(x,y) = -x^{3} - x y^{2} + y$.

By the Bendixson–Dulac criterion, there are no periodic orbits anywhere in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$.\n\nSecond method (radial monotonicity, for confirmation):\n- Let $r^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2}$. Compute the time derivative of $r^{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(r^{2}) = \\frac{d}{dt}(x^{2} + y^{2}) = 2 x \\frac{dx}{dt} + 2 y \\frac{dy}{dt}.\n$$\nSubstitute the right-hand sides:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(r^{2}) = 2 x (x^{2}y + y^{3} + x) + 2 y (-x^{3} - x y^{2} + y).\n$$\nExpand and simplify term by term:\n$$\n2 x (x^{2}y) = 2 x^{3} y, \\quad 2 x (y^{3}) = 2 x y^{3}, \\quad 2 x (x) = 2 x^{2},\n$$\n$$\n2 y (-x^{3}) = -2 x^{3} y, \\quad 2 y (-x y^{2}) = -2 x y^{3}, \\quad 2 y (y) = 2 y^{2}.\n$$\nSumming,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(r^{2}) = (2 x^{3} y - 2 x^{3} y) + (2 x y^{3} - 2 x y^{3}) + (2 x^{2} + 2 y^{2}) = 2 (x^{2} + y^{2}) = 2 r^{2}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\ln r^{2}) = \\frac{1}{r^{2}} \\frac{d}{dt}(r^{2}) = 2,\n$$\nwhich integrates to\n$$\nr^{2}(t) = r^{2}(0) \\exp(2 t), \\quad \\text{hence} \\quad r(t) = r(0) \\exp(t) \\quad \\text{for } r(0)  0.\n$$\nTherefore $r(t)$ is strictly increasing for all forward time whenever $r(0)  0$, and strictly decreasing for backward time, which precludes any nontrivial closed orbit (a periodic solution would require $r(t)$ to be periodic and thus non-monotone).
