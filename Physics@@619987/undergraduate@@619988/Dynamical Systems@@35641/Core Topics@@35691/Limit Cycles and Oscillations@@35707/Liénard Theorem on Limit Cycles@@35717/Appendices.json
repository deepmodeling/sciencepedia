Its denominator is $x^2 + 1$, which is never zero for any real $x$. Therefore, $f(x)$ is also infinitely differentiable for all real $x$. This means option E is incorrect.\n\nNow we check the four conditions of the theorem.\n\n**Condition (i): $f(x)$ is an even function.**\nWe test the parity of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(-x) = \\mu \\frac{(-x)^2 - 1}{(-x)^2+1} = \\mu \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2+1} = f(x) $$\nSince $f(-x) = f(x)$, the function $f(x)$ is indeed even. Condition (i) is satisfied. This means option B is incorrect.\n\n**Condition (ii): $g(x)$ is an odd function and $x \\cdot g(x) > 0$ for $x \\neq 0$.**\nFirst, we test the parity of $g(x)$:\n$$ g(-x) = (-x) = -x = -g(x) $$\nSo, $g(x)$ is an odd function.\nNext, we check the sign of $x \\cdot g(x)$:\n$$ x \\cdot g(x) = x \\cdot x = x^2 $$\nFor any non-zero real number $x$, $x^2$ is strictly positive. So, $x \\cdot g(x) > 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. Condition (ii) is satisfied. This means option C is incorrect.\n\n**Conditions (iii) and (iv): Properties of the primitive function $F(x) = \\int_0^x f(u) \\, du$.**\nWe first compute $F(x)$:\n$$ F(x) = \\int_0^x \\mu \\frac{u^2 - 1}{u^2+1} \\, du $$\nWe can simplify the integrand:\n$$ \\frac{u^2 - 1}{u^2+1} = \\frac{(u^2+1) - 2}{u^2+1} = 1 - \\frac{2}{u^2+1} $$\nNow, we integrate:\n$$ F(x) = \\mu \\int_0^x \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{u^2+1}\\right) du = \\mu \\left[ u - 2\\arctan(u) \\right]_0^x $$\n$$ F(x) = \\mu (x - 2\\arctan(x)) $$\nNow, we analyze the properties of $F(x)$. Since $\\mu > 0$, the sign of $F(x)$ is determined by the sign of the function $h(x) = x - 2\\arctan(x)$.\n\n**Check for roots (Condition iii):** We need to find the number of positive roots of $F(x)$, which is equivalent to finding the positive roots of $h(x)=0$.\n$h(x) = 0 \\implies x = 2\\arctan(x)$.\nWe know $h(0) = 0 - 2\\arctan(0) = 0$. So $x=0$ is a root.\nTo find other roots, we analyze the derivative of $h(x)$:\n$$ h'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x - 2\\arctan(x)) = 1 - \\frac{2}{1+x^2} = \\frac{1+x^2-2}{1+x^2} = \\frac{x^2-1}{1+x^2} $$\nFor $x > 0$:\n- If $0 < x < 1$, then $x^2 < 1$, so $h'(x) < 0$. The function $h(x)$ is decreasing.\n- If $x = 1$, then $h'(x) = 0$. The function has a local minimum.\n- If $x > 1$, then $x^2 > 1$, so $h'(x) > 0$. The function $h(x)$ is increasing.\nThe function $h(x)$ starts at $h(0)=0$, decreases to a minimum value at $x=1$, which is $h(1) = 1 - 2\\arctan(1) = 1 - 2(\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} < 0$. Then, for $x>1$, $h(x)$ increases.\nAs $x \\to \\infty$, $h(x) = x - 2\\arctan(x) \\to \\infty - 2(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = \\infty$.\nSince $h(x)$ is continuous, starts at a value of 0, decreases to a negative minimum, and then increases to $+\\infty$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there must be exactly one positive value $x=a$ (with $a>1$) where $h(a)=0$.\nThus, $F(x)$ has exactly one positive root. Condition (iii) is satisfied. This means option D is incorrect.\n\n**Check for sign and monotonicity (Condition iv):**\n- **Sign for $0 < x < a$**: Since $F(0)=0$ and $F(x)$ has its only positive root at $x=a$, and we know that $F(x)$ is decreasing on $(0,1)$ (to a negative value), it must be that $F(x) < 0$ for the entire interval $(0,a)$. This part is satisfied.\n- **Behavior for $x > a$**:\n  - Sign: For any $x>a$, since $a$ is the only positive root and $F(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$, $F(x)$ must be positive for all $x>a$.\n  - Monotonicity: We need to check if $F(x)$ is non-decreasing for $x>a$. The derivative of $F(x)$ is $F'(x) = f(x) = \\mu \\frac{x^2-1}{x^2+1}$. We found that the root $a$ is greater than 1. So, for any $x>a$, we have $x>1$. This implies $x^2-1 > 0$. Since $\\mu>0$ and $x^2+1>0$, it follows that $F'(x) > 0$ for all $x>a$. A function with a positive derivative is strictly increasing, which is a stronger condition than non-decreasing.\nTherefore, $F(x)$ is positive and non-decreasing for $x > a$. Condition (iv) is satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll four conditions of Liénard's theorem have been verified and are satisfied.
