The fast equation is $\\epsilon \\dot{x} = f(x) - y$, so $x$ is fast and $y$ is slow. The critical manifold is given by the algebraic constraint $y = f(x)$, with piecewise-linear $f$:\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\n-x - 2, & x < -1,\\\\\nx, & -1 \\leq x \\leq 1,\\\\\n-x + 2, & x > 1.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe fast subsystem at fixed $y$ is $\\dot{x} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}(f(x) - y)$, whose linearization in $x$ about the critical manifold has derivative $f'(x)$. Thus branches with $f'(x) < 0$ are attracting (outer branches $x < -1$ and $x > 1$), while the middle branch with $f'(x) = 1$ for $|x| \\leq 1$ is repelling. Hence, in the singular limit, the trajectory follows the outer branches and undergoes fast jumps at the corners $x = \\pm 1$.\n\nOn the slow manifold $y = f(x)$, differentiating the constraint yields $\\dot{y} = f'(x)\\dot{x}$.

Approaching the right corner at $x = 1$ along $y = -x + 2$, we have $y = 1$. Holding $y$ fixed during the fast jump, the attracting equilibrium of the fast subsystem satisfies $f(x) = 1$ with $f'(x) < 0$, which occurs at $x = -3$ (since $-x - 2 = 1$ implies $x = -3$). Similarly, approaching the left corner at $x = -1$ along $y = -x - 2$, we have $y = -1$, and the attracting fast equilibrium with $f(x) = -1$ is $x = 3$ (since $-x + 2 = -1$ implies $x = 3$). Therefore, the singular periodic orbit consists of:\n- Slow drift on the right branch from $x = 3$ to $x = 1$,\n- Fast jump at $y = 1$ to $x = -3$,\n- Slow drift on the left branch from $x = -3$ to $x = -1$,\n- Fast jump at $y = -1$ to $x = 3$.\n\nThe time spent on fast jumps is $O(\\epsilon)$ and vanishes as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, so the period $T$ is the sum of the slow times on the two outer branches.\n\nOn each attracting branch, $\\dot{x} = -x$, so $dt = -dx/x$.
