This stage consists of an ideal inductor with inductance $L$ and an ideal capacitor with capacitance $C$. Initially, the capacitor is charged by an external power source to a total charge of $Q_0$. At time $t=0$, the power source is disconnected, and the capacitor is connected to the inductor, forming a closed, ideal LC circuit. The current in the circuit is zero at the instant of connection, $t=0$.

Express your answer in terms of $L$, $C$, and $Q_0$.", "solution": "The physical system described is an ideal LC circuit. To find the current $i(t)$, we begin by applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the closed loop. KVL states that the sum of the potential differences across all elements in a closed loop must be zero.\n\nLet $V_L(t)$ be the voltage across the inductor and $V_C(t)$ be the voltage across the capacitor. The application of KVL gives:\n$$V_L(t) + V_C(t) = 0$$\n\nThe voltage across an inductor is given by $V_L = L \\frac{di}{dt}$, and the voltage across a capacitor is given by $V_C = \\frac{q}{C}$, where $q(t)$ is the charge on the capacitor at time $t$ and $i(t)$ is the current flowing in the circuit. Substituting these into the KVL equation yields:\n$$L \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + \\frac{q(t)}{C} = 0$$\n\nThis equation involves two different variables, $i(t)$ and $q(t)$. We need to express one in terms of the other. The current is defined as the rate of change of charge, $i(t) = \\frac{dq(t)}{dt}$. Note that a positive current corresponds to a decrease in the charge on the capacitor, so we could also write $i = -dq/dt$ depending on sign conventions. Let's define the current $i(t)$ as the rate at which charge *leaves* the positive plate of the capacitor, so $i(t) = -\\frac{dq(t)}{dt}$. This means $\\frac{di(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{d^2q(t)}{dt^2}$. Substituting this into our KVL equation:\n$$L \\left(-\\frac{d^2q(t)}{dt^2}\\right) + \\frac{q(t)}{C} = 0$$\nMultiplying by -1 and dividing by $L$, we obtain the standard form of a second-order homogeneous linear differential equation:\n$$\\frac{d^2q(t)}{dt^2} + \\frac{1}{LC} q(t) = 0$$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The general solution for $q(t)$ is:\n$$q(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nwhere the angular frequency $\\omega$ is given by:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}$$\nThe constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by the initial conditions of the circuit. The problem states that at $t=0$, the initial charge on the capacitor is $Q_0$ and the initial current is $0$.\n\nFirst, we apply the initial charge condition, $q(0) = Q_0$:\n$$q(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 = A$$\nThus, we find $A = Q_0$.\n\nNext, we apply the initial current condition, $i(0) = 0$. We first need an expression for the current $i(t)$ by differentiating $q(t)$ with respect to time. Using our sign convention $i(t) = -\\frac{dq}{dt}$:\n$$i(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} [A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)] = -[-A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t) + B\\omega \\cos(\\omega t)]$$\n$$i(t) = A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t) - B\\omega \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nNow, we apply the condition $i(0) = 0$:\n$$i(0) = A\\omega \\sin(0) - B\\omega \\cos(0) = A\\omega \\cdot 0 - B\\omega \\cdot 1 = -B\\omega$$\nSince we are given $i(0)=0$, we have $-B\\omega = 0$. As $\\omega = 1/\\sqrt{LC}$ is non-zero, this implies that $B=0$.\n\nWe have now determined both constants: $A=Q_0$ and $B=0$. We can substitute these back into our expression for the current $i(t)$:\n$$i(t) = Q_0\\omega \\sin(\\omega t) - (0)\\omega \\cos(\\omega t) = Q_0\\omega \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for the angular frequency, $\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}}$, to get the final answer in terms of the given parameters:\n$$i(t) = Q_0 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{LC}}\\right)$$\n\n*Self-consistency check with the alternative sign convention*: If we had defined $i = +dq/dt$, the KVL equation would be $L(d^2q/dt^2) + q/C = 0$. The general solution for $q(t)$ remains the same: $q(t) = A\\cos(\\omega t) + B\\sin(\\omega t)$. The initial conditions $q(0)=Q_0$ and $i(0)=(dq/dt)|_{t=0}=0$ would lead to $A=Q_0$ and $B=0$. So, $q(t) = Q_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$. Then $i(t) = dq/dt = -Q_0\\omega \\sin(\\omega t)$. This leads to $i(t) = -\\frac{Q_0}{\\sqrt{LC}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{LC}}\\right)$. The negative sign simply indicates the direction of current flow. When a question asks for \"the current\", a choice of sign that reflects the physics is acceptable. A positive current flowing out of the initially positive plate of the capacitor is physically correct at the start of the oscillation. Thus, our first derivation is also correct, but the sign depends on the chosen convention. The expression $-\\frac{Q_0}{\\sqrt{LC}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{LC}}\\right)$ is the standard textbook result. Let's adopt that by finalizing the second derivation.\nRevisiting the current definition: $i = dq/dt$.\n$q(t)=Q_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$\nThen $i(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} [Q_0 \\cos(\\omega t)] = - Q_0 \\omega \\sin(\\omega t)$.\nSubstituting $\\omega = 1/\\sqrt{LC}$:\n$i(t) = - \\frac{Q_0}{\\sqrt{LC}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{LC}}\\right)$.\nThis result indicates that for small $t>0$, the current is negative. This means charge is flowing away from the plate we defined as holding $+Q_0$, which is physically correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{i(t) = -\\frac{Q_0}{\\sqrt{LC}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{LC}}\\right)}$$", "id": "1660867"}, {"introduction": "While many introductory problems assume ideal, linear components, real-world systems often exhibit non-linear behavior.
