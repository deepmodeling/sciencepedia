This can be solved by applying the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. The total mechanical energy $E$ of the pendulum is the sum of its kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $U$, and this total energy is constant throughout the motion.\n\nFirst, let's define the expressions for kinetic and potential energy. We set the gravitational potential energy to be zero at the lowest point of the swing, where $\\theta=0$. At an arbitrary angle $\\theta$, the height of the mass $m$ above this reference point is $h = L - L\\cos(\\theta) = L(1 - \\cos(\\theta))$.\nThe potential energy is therefore:\n$$U = mgh = mgL(1 - \\cos(\\theta))$$\n\nThe tangential speed of the mass is $v = L\\dot{\\theta}$, where $\\dot{\\theta}$ is the angular velocity. The kinetic energy is:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m(L\\dot{\\theta})^2 = \\frac{1}{2}mL^2\\dot{\\theta}^2$$\n\nThe total mechanical energy $E$ is given by:\n$$E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2}mL^2\\dot{\\theta}^2 + mgL(1 - \\cos(\\theta))$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the energy for the two specific states described in the problem.\n\nThe initial state (State 1) is at the pendulum's lowest point, $\\theta_1 = 0$, where it is given the critical initial angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}_1 = \\dot{\\theta}_c$. The energy in this state is:\n$$E_1 = \\frac{1}{2}mL^2\\dot{\\theta}_c^2 + mgL(1 - \\cos(0))$$\nSince $\\cos(0) = 1$, the potential energy term is zero:\n$$E_1 = \\frac{1}{2}mL^2\\dot{\\theta}_c^2$$\n\nThe separatrix trajectory is defined as the one where the pendulum just reaches the unstable equilibrium point (vertically upwards) and momentarily stops. This final state (State 2) is characterized by the angle $\\theta_2 = \\pi$ and an angular velocity of $\\dot{\\theta}_2 = 0$. The energy in this state is:\n$$E_2 = \\frac{1}{2}mL^2(0)^2 + mgL(1 - \\cos(\\pi))$$\nSince $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, the energy is:\n$$E_2 = mgL(1 - (-1)) = 2mgL$$\n\nAccording to the principle of conservation of energy, the energy in the initial state must equal the energy in the final state, so $E_1 = E_2$.\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mL^2\\dot{\\theta}_c^2 = 2mgL$$\n\nNow, we solve for the critical angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}_c$. The mass $m$ cancels from both sides:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}L^2\\dot{\\theta}_c^2 = 2gL$$\nWe can divide both sides by $L$ (since $L \\neq 0$):\n$$\\frac{1}{2}L\\dot{\\theta}_c^2 = 2g$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\dot{\\theta}_c^2$:\n$$\\dot{\\theta}_c^2 = \\frac{4g}{L}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the magnitude of the critical angular velocity.
