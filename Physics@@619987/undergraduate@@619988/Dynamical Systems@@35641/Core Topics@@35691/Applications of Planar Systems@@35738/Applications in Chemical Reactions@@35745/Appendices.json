By setting up and solving a simple system of differential equations, you will see how the intrinsic rates of each pathway, represented by their respective rate constants $k_M$ and $k_P$, directly determine the final ratio of products. This principle of kinetic control is fundamental to chemical synthesis and pharmacology, where maximizing the yield of a desired product over an unwanted byproduct is often a primary goal [@problem_id:1660573].", "problem": "A newly synthesized drug molecule, denoted as $X$, is found to be unstable in a physiological environment. It can undergo one of two parallel, irreversible, first-order degradation pathways. The first pathway converts $X$ into a therapeutic metabolite $M$ with a rate constant $k_M$. The second pathway converts $X$ into an inert byproduct $P$ with a rate constant $k_P$. A solution is prepared with an initial concentration of $X$ and no initial concentration of either $M$ or $P$. After a very long time, the reaction system reaches completion, meaning all of the initial reactant $X$ has been converted. Determine the ratio of the final concentration of the therapeutic metabolite to the final concentration of the inert byproduct, which can be written as $[M]_{\\text{final}} / [P]_{\\text{final}}$.
