{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A crucial first step in analyzing any dynamical system is to find its equilibrium points—states where the variables, in this case populations, remain unchanged over time. For a predator-prey model, the non-trivial equilibrium represents a point of balance where both species can coexist. This practice guides you through the algebraic steps to calculate the specific population sizes that achieve this coexistence, providing a foundational skill for understanding the steady states of an ecosystem [@problem_id:1861225].", "id": "1861225", "problem": "Ecologists are studying a simplified ecosystem on a newly discovered moon orbiting a gas giant. This moon harbors two primary species of motile organisms: a small, herbivorous creature known as the \"Crystal Crawler\" and its predator, the \"Shadow Stalker.\" The population dynamics of this system can be described by a set of coupled interactions.\n\nLet $N$ be the population size of the Crystal Crawlers and $P$ be the population size of the Shadow Stalkers.\n\nThe growth of the Crystal Crawler population is governed by two factors. In the absence of predators, their population grows at a rate directly proportional to their current numbers, with an intrinsic per-capita growth rate constant of $r = 0.4$ per year. However, predation by Shadow Stalkers causes a decline in their population. The rate of this decline is proportional to the product of the two population sizes, $N \\times P$, with an interaction coefficient of $\\alpha = 0.01$ per year per stalker.\n\nThe Shadow Stalker population dynamics are also dependent on the Crystal Crawlers. Without their prey, the Shadow Stalkers' population would decline due to natural causes, with a per-capita death rate of $m = 0.2$ per year. The consumption of Crystal Crawlers allows the Shadow Stalker population to grow. The rate of this growth is proportional to the rate at which they consume prey, with a conversion efficiency factor of $\\beta = 0.1$. This factor represents the fraction of consumed prey biomass that is converted into new predator biomass.\n\nAssuming this system can reach a state where both populations remain constant over time, determine the non-trivial equilibrium population sizes for the Crystal Crawlers and the Shadow Stalkers.

Let $x(t)$ represent the population of the prey species (e.g., rabbits) and $y(t)$ represent the population of the predator species (e.g., foxes) at time $t$.

Based on your analysis, select the option below that correctly identifies the mathematical classification of this fixed point and its corresponding biological implication for the ecosystem.\n\nA. The fixed point is a saddle point. This state is unstable. If predators are absent ($y=0$), the prey population grows. If prey are absent ($x=0$), the predator population dies out. Trajectories with any small, non-zero population of both species will move away from the extinction state.\n\nB. The fixed point is a stable node. This means that if the populations are small, they will inevitably decline towards total extinction, making the extinction state a stable outcome for the ecosystem.\n\nC. The fixed point is an unstable node. This means that any small, non-zero population of either or both species will lead to growth, and the system will always move away from the extinction state, irrespective of the initial small populations.\n\nD. The fixed point is a center. This implies that small populations will oscillate in tiny, stable cycles around the extinction point, never dying out completely nor growing unboundedly.\n\nE. The fixed point is a stable spiral. This implies that small populations will oscillate with decreasing amplitude, eventually spiraling into the extinction state.\n\n", "solution": "We analyze the stability of the fixed point at $(0,0)$ by linearizing the system.

Therefore, the fixed point is hyperbolic with eigenvalues of opposite sign, which classifies it as a saddle point. The corresponding eigenvectors align with the coordinate axes because the Jacobian is diagonal: along the $x$-axis where $y=0$, the linearized dynamics satisfy $\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\alpha x$ and hence the prey population grows exponentially away from zero; along the $y$-axis where $x=0$, the linearized dynamics satisfy $\\frac{dy}{dt}=-\\gamma y$ and hence the predator population decays exponentially to zero.
