Let $J(t)$ be the population of juveniles and $A(t)$ be the population of adults at time $t$. The dynamics of the population are governed by the following set of interactions:\n\n1.  New juveniles are produced exclusively by the adult population at a constant per-capita rate of $b$ juveniles per adult, per year.\n2.  Juveniles mature into adults at a constant per-capita rate of $m$ per year. They do not reproduce.\n3.  Juveniles experience natural mortality at a constant per-capita rate of $d_J$ per year.\n4.  Adults experience natural mortality at a constant per-capita rate of $d_A$ per year. Their population only increases from the maturation of juveniles.\n\nAll parameters $b, m, d_J, d_A$ are positive constants. The total population is considered to be experiencing long-term growth if, for almost all non-zero initial populations, the total count $N(t) = J(t) + A(t)$ tends to infinity as $t \\to \\infty$. To ensure the survival of the species, the birth rate $b$ must be sufficiently high to overcome mortality and ensure growth.\n\nDetermine the critical birth rate, $b_c$, which represents the minimum value of $b$ required for the species' total population to exhibit long-term growth.

By the rules given:\n- Adults produce juveniles at per-capita rate $b$, so the inflow to $J$ is $bA$.\n- Juveniles mature at per-capita rate $m$, so the outflow from $J$ to $A$ is $mJ$.\n- Juveniles die at per-capita rate $d_{J}$, so the outflow from $J$ is $d_{J}J$.\n- Adults die at per-capita rate $d_{A}$, so the outflow from $A$ is $d_{A}A$.\n\nTherefore, the ODEs are\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{dt}=bA-(m+d_{J})J, \\qquad \\frac{dA}{dt}=mJ-d_{A}A.\n$$\nThis can be written in matrix form $\\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix}J\\\\ A\\end{pmatrix}=M\\begin{pmatrix}J\\\\ A\\end{pmatrix}$ with\n$$\nM=\\begin{pmatrix}-(m+d_{J})  b \\\\ m  -d_{A}\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nLong-term growth (i.e., $J(t)+A(t)\\to\\infty$ for almost all non-zero initial states) occurs if and only if the dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}$ of $M$ is positive, because solutions are linear combinations of terms proportional to $\\exp(\\lambda t)$ for eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $M$.

Since $M$ is a $2\\times 2$ Metzler matrix with negative trace\n$$\n\\operatorname{tr}(M)=-(m+d_{J})-d_{A}0,\n$$\nthe threshold where an eigenvalue is exactly zero is given by the condition that $0$ is an eigenvalue, i.e., the determinant vanishes:\n$$\n\\det(M)=0.\n$$\nCompute the determinant:\n$$\n\\det(M)=\\bigl(-(m+d_{J})\\bigr)\\bigl(-d_{A}\\bigr)-bm=d_{A}(m+d_{J})-bm.\n$$\nSetting $\\det(M)=0$ at the threshold and solving for $b$ gives\n$$\nd_{A}(m+d_{J})-bm=0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad b_{c}=\\frac{d_{A}(m+d_{J})}{m}.\n$$\nBecause $\\operatorname{tr}(M)0$ for all parameter values, for $bb_{c}$ one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, so solutions generically grow without bound in time, while for $bb_{c}$ both eigenvalues are negative, implying decay.
