A key parameter for its practical use is its stability under illumination. The biochemist performs an experiment and observes that the process of photobleaching, where the molecule irreversibly loses its fluorescence, follows a specific kinetic law. The rate of loss of fluorescent molecules, represented by their concentration $C(t)$ at time $t$, is found to be directly proportional to the concentration of molecules present at that moment. The constant of proportionality is the photobleaching rate constant, $k$.\n\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is a crucial metric defined as the time required for the concentration of fluorescent molecules to fall to 50% of its initial concentration, $C_0$.
