In this model, the population is divided into three groups: Susceptible (S), individuals who have not yet been exposed to the misinformation; Infected (I), individuals who are actively spreading it; and Recovered (R), individuals who have seen the misinformation and are no longer spreading it (e.g., they have been fact-checked or lost interest).\n\nThe dynamics of the spread are characterized by two key parameters:\n1.  The transmission rate, $\\beta$, which represents the rate at which an infected individual transmits the misinformation to a susceptible individual.\n2.  The recovery rate, $\\gamma$, which is the rate at which infected individuals stop spreading the misinformation and enter the recovered class.\n\nThe potential for an epidemic outbreak is determined by the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, which is the average number of new infections caused by a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population. For this SIR model, the basic reproduction number is given by the ratio $R_0 = \\beta / \\gamma$. An epidemic will occur if and only if $R_0 > 1$.\n\nInitial analysis of a particular misinformation campaign yields a basic reproduction number of $R_0 = 3.5$.

We are given the initial basic reproduction number, $R_0$, and the formula relating it to the model parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the condition for preventing an epidemic. An epidemic occurs if the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is greater than 1. Therefore, to prevent an epidemic, the new basic reproduction number, which we'll call $R_{0, \\text{new}}$, must be less than or equal to 1.
