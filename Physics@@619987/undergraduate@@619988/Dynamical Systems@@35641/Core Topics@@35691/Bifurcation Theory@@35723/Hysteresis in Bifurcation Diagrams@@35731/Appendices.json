By deriving the exact analytical expressions for these critical points, you will gain a fundamental understanding of how the boundaries of a hysteresis loop are determined.", "problem": "A simplified model for the state $x$ of a certain nonlinear electronic switching component is described by the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = r - x + \\alpha \\tanh(x)\n$$\nHere, $t$ is time, $r$ is a slowly adjustable control parameter (proportional to a control voltage), and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the strength of an internal feedback mechanism. For a specific device, the feedback strength is measured to be $\\alpha = 3$.\n\nThe system is first prepared in a steady state with a large negative control parameter $r$. The parameter $r$ is then slowly increased. It is observed that at a critical value $r_{up}$, the system's state $x$ abruptly jumps from a lower stable value to a higher stable value. Subsequently, if the system is prepared in a steady state with a large positive $r$ and $r$ is slowly decreased, the state $x$ follows the upper branch until a different critical value $r_{down}$ is reached, at which point it abruptly jumps back down to the lower stable value. This entire process forms a hysteresis loop.\n\nYour task is to determine the exact analytical expressions for the two critical control parameters, $r_{up}$ and $r_{down}$. Present your final answer as an ordered pair $(r_{up}, r_{down})$ in a row matrix.", "solution": "The state of the system is governed by the differential equation $\\frac{dx}{dt} = r - x + 3\\tanh(x)$.\nThe steady states, or fixed points, of the system are the values of $x$ for which $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$.\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the equation for the fixed points $x^*$:\n$$0 = r - x^* + 3\\tanh(x^*)$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$r = x^* - 3\\tanh(x^*)$$\nLet's define the function $g(x) = x - 3\\tanh(x)$. The fixed points for a given $r$ are the intersections of the horizontal line $y=r$ with the curve $y=g(x)$.\n\nThe abrupt jumps in the system's state correspond to saddle-node bifurcations. These bifurcations occur when a stable and an unstable fixed point merge and annihilate. This happens at the local extrema (local maximum and local minimum) of the function $g(x)$. The values of $r$ at these extrema are the bifurcation points $r_{up}$ and $r_{down}$.\n\nTo find these extrema, we need to find the critical points of $g(x)$ by taking its derivative with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero.\n$$g'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x - 3\\tanh(x) \\right) = 1 - 3\\,\\text{sech}^2(x)$$\nSet $g'(x) = 0$ to find the values of $x$ at the extrema, which we'll call $x_c$:\n$$1 - 3\\,\\text{sech}^2(x_c) = 0$$\n$$\\text{sech}^2(x_c) = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nSince $\\text{sech}(x) = 1/\\cosh(x)$, this implies:\n$$\\cosh^2(x_c) = 3$$\n$$\\cosh(x_c) = \\sqrt{3}$$\nNote that we take the positive square root because $\\cosh(x)$ is always positive.\n\nThe solutions for $x_c$ are given by $x_c = \\pm \\text{arccosh}(\\sqrt{3})$.\nWe can express $\\text{arccosh}(z)$ using the natural logarithm as $\\ln(z + \\sqrt{z^2-1})$. So,\n$$x_c = \\pm \\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{(\\sqrt{3})^2 - 1}) = \\pm \\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2})$$\nSo we have two critical points: $x_{c1} = -\\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2})$ and $x_{c2} = \\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2})$.\n\nTo determine which of these corresponds to $r_{up}$ and which to $r_{down}$, we need to identify which is a local maximum and which is a local minimum of $g(x)$. We can use the second derivative test.\n$$g''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( 1 - 3\\,\\text{sech}^2(x) \\right) = -3 \\cdot 2\\,\\text{sech}(x) \\cdot (-\\text{sech}(x)\\tanh(x)) = 6\\,\\text{sech}^2(x)\\tanh(x)$$\nSince $\\text{sech}^2(x)$ is always positive, the sign of $g''(x)$ is the same as the sign of $\\tanh(x)$, which in turn is the same as the sign of $x$.\n- For $x_{c1} = -\\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}) < 0$, we have $g''(x_{c1}) < 0$. This corresponds to a local maximum of $g(x)$. As $r$ is increased, this is the last point where the lower stable state can exist before jumping up. Thus, this gives $r_{up}$.\n- For $x_{c2} = \\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}) > 0$, we have $g''(x_{c2}) > 0$. This corresponds to a local minimum of $g(x)$. As $r$ is decreased, this is the last point where the upper stable state can exist before jumping down. Thus, this gives $r_{down}$.\n\nNow we evaluate $g(x)$ at these critical points to find the values of $r_{up}$ and $r_{down}$.\nWe need $\\tanh(x_c)$. We know $\\cosh(x_c)=\\sqrt{3}$. Using the identity $\\tanh^2(x) = 1 - \\text{sech}^2(x)$, we have:\n$$\\tanh^2(x_c) = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n$$\\tanh(x_c) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\nThe sign of $\\tanh(x_c)$ is the same as the sign of $x_c$.\n- For $x_{c1} = -\\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2})$, $\\tanh(x_{c1}) = -\\sqrt{2/3}$.\n- For $x_{c2} = \\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2})$, $\\tanh(x_{c2}) = \\sqrt{2/3}$.\n\nNow we can calculate $r_{up}$ and $r_{down}$:\n$r_{up} = g(x_{c1}) = x_{c1} - 3\\tanh(x_{c1}) = -\\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}) - 3\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\right)$\n$$r_{up} = -\\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}) + 3\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}} = -\\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}) + \\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{6} - \\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2})$$\n\n$r_{down} = g(x_{c2}) = x_{c2} - 3\\tanh(x_{c2}) = \\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}) - 3\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\right)$\n$$r_{down} = \\ln(\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}) - \\sqrt{6}$$\n\nThe ordered pair is $(r_{up}, r_{down})$.\nThe problem asks for the values of $(r_{up}, r_{down})$.\n$r_{up} = \\sqrt{6} - \\ln(\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2})$\n$r_{down} = \\ln(\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}) - \\sqrt{6}$\n\nWe present the result as a row matrix as requested.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{6} - \\ln(\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}) & \\ln(\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{2}) - \\sqrt{6} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1683365"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the canonical model, we now apply our skills to a different system, representing a nonlinear electronic component.
