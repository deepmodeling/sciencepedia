This practice [@problem_id:1704683] challenges you to think beyond local stability and determine the entire basin of attraction for the stable node. You will discover the crucial role that the saddle point plays, with its stable manifold acting as a \"separatrix\" that partitions the state space into distinct regions of behavior.", "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional dynamical system described by the following equations:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{x} &= a(r - x^2) \\\\\n\\dot{y} &= -by\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are time-dependent variables, and $a, b, r$ are positive real parameters. This system exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation at a critical value of the parameter $r$. For values of $r > 0$, the system possesses two fixed points, one of which is a stable node.\n\nA rectangular domain $\\mathcal{D}$ is defined in the phase space by $-L \\le x \\le L$ and $-H \\le y \\le H$, where $L$ and $H$ are positive constants. It is given that the domain is large enough to contain both fixed points, which implies $L > \\sqrt{r}$.\n\nDetermine the fraction of the area of the domain $\\mathcal{D}$ that belongs to the basin of attraction of the stable node.

Then, we need to determine the basin of attraction for the stable fixed point. Finally, we calculate the area of the portion of the given domain $\\mathcal{D}$ that lies within this basin and find its fraction relative to the total area of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nFirst, we find the fixed points by setting $\\dot{x} = 0$ and $\\dot{y} = 0$:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na(r - x^2) &= 0 \\\\\n-by &= 0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nFrom the second equation, since $b > 0$, we have $y = 0$.\nFrom the first equation, since $a > 0$, we have $x^2 = r$. Since $r > 0$, this gives $x = \\pm\\sqrt{r}$.\nThus, for $r > 0$, there are two fixed points: $P_1 = (\\sqrt{r}, 0)$ and $P_2 = (-\\sqrt{r}, 0)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of these fixed points by linearizing the system. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2ax & 0 \\\\ 0 & -b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each fixed point.\n\nFor $P_1 = (\\sqrt{r}, 0)$:\n$$\nJ(\\sqrt{r}, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2a\\sqrt{r} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = -2a\\sqrt{r}$ and $\\lambda_2 = -b$. Since $a, b, r$ are all positive, both eigenvalues are negative.

Since one eigenvalue is positive and the other is negative, $P_2$ is a saddle point.\n\nNow, we determine the basin of attraction for the stable node $P_1 = (\\sqrt{r}, 0)$. The system's dynamics are decoupled. The equation $\\dot{y} = -by$ implies that for any initial condition $y(0) \\neq 0$, $y(t) = y(0)\\exp(-bt)$, so $y(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. All trajectories approach the $x$-axis.\n\nThe dynamics on the $x$-axis (and for any constant $y$) are governed by $\\dot{x} = a(r-x^2)$. The function $f(x) = a(r-x^2)$ is a downward-opening parabola with roots at $x = \\pm\\sqrt{r}$.\n- If $x > \\sqrt{r}$, $\\dot{x} < 0$, so $x(t)$ decreases towards $\\sqrt{r}$.\n- If $-\\sqrt{r} < x < \\sqrt{r}$, $\\dot{x} > 0$, so $x(t)$ increases towards $\\sqrt{r}$.\n- If $x < -\\sqrt{r}$, $\\dot{x} < 0$, so $x(t)$ decreases towards $-\\infty$.\n\nA trajectory starting at $(x_0, y_0)$ will converge to the stable node $P_1 = (\\sqrt{r}, 0)$ if and only if its $x$-coordinate converges to $\\sqrt{r}$. Based on the analysis above, this occurs for any initial condition $x_0 > -\\sqrt{r}$. The line $x = -\\sqrt{r}$ is the stable manifold of the saddle point $P_2$ and acts as a separatrix. All initial conditions $(x_0, y_0)$ with $x_0 > -\\sqrt{r}$ belong to the basin of attraction of the stable node $P_1$. The basin of attraction is the open half-plane defined by $x > -\\sqrt{r}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the fraction of the area of the domain $\\mathcal{D}$ that lies in this basin. The domain $\\mathcal{D}$ is the rectangle defined by $-L \\le x \\le L$ and $-H \\le y \\le H$.\nThe total area of $\\mathcal{D}$ is $A_{total} = (L - (-L)) \\times (H - (-H)) = (2L)(2H) = 4LH$.\n\nThe part of the domain $\\mathcal{D}$ that belongs to the basin of attraction is the region where both the conditions for $\\mathcal{D}$ and the basin are met.
