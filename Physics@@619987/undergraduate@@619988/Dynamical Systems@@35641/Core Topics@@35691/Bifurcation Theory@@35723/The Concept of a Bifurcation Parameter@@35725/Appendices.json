By analyzing this system, you will determine the precise threshold values of the parameter $a$ where equilibrium points are born and annihilated, a hallmark of the saddle-node bifurcation [@problem_id:1714937].", "problem": "The dynamics of the phase difference, $\\phi(t)$, in a simplified first-order Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) can be modeled by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = \\Delta\\omega_0 - K_g \\sin(\\phi) $$\nHere, $\\phi(t)$ is the phase difference between an input reference signal and a local oscillator, $\\Delta\\omega_0$ represents the initial frequency difference between the input and the oscillator's free-running frequency, and $K_g$ is a positive constant representing the total loop gain.\n\nFor analysis, it is useful to work with a dimensionless form of this equation. By introducing a dimensionless time $\\tau = K_g t$ and a dimensionless frequency mismatch parameter $a = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega_0}{K_g}$, the equation of motion simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\tau} = a - \\sin(\\phi) $$\nThe system is considered to be \"in lock\" if the phase difference $\\phi$ can settle to a constant value over time.

Bifurcations occur for all $|a| > 1$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the values of the parameter $a$ at which the dynamical system described by $\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\tau} = a - \\sin(\\phi)$ undergoes a bifurcation. A bifurcation occurs when a small change in a system parameter causes a qualitative change in the long-term behavior of the system. For a one-dimensional system like this, this typically involves a change in the number of fixed points or their stability.\n\nFirst, we find the fixed points (or equilibrium points) of the system. Fixed points, denoted by $\\phi^*$, are values of $\\phi$ where the system does not change in time, i.e., $\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\tau} = 0$.\nSetting the right-hand side of the equation to zero gives:\n$$ a - \\sin(\\phi^*) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sin(\\phi^*) = a $$\nThe range of the sine function is $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, for real solutions for $\\phi^*$ to exist, the parameter $a$ must be in the range $-1 \\le a \\le 1$.\n- If $|a| > 1$, there are no real values of $\\phi^*$ that satisfy this equation. Thus, there are no fixed points.\n- If $|a|  1$, there are two families of fixed points in each interval of length $2\\pi$. For example, in the interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, the two fixed points are $\\phi_1^* = \\arcsin(a)$ and $\\phi_2^* = \\pi - \\arcsin(a)$ if $a>0$, or $\\phi_2^* = -\\pi - \\arcsin(a)$ if $a0$.\n- If $a=1$, the solutions for $\\sin(\\phi^*) = 1$ are $\\phi^* = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. All these solutions coalesce into a single family of fixed points.\n- If $a=-1$, the solutions for $\\sin(\\phi^*) = -1$ are $\\phi^* = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$. Similarly, these coalesce into a single family.\n\nA bifurcation occurs at the parameter values where the number of fixed points changes. As we see from the analysis above, the system transitions from having fixed points (for $|a| \\le 1$) to having no fixed points (for $|a| > 1$). This transition happens precisely at the boundaries of this region, i.e., at $a=1$ and $a=-1$.\n\nTo confirm that these are indeed bifurcation points, we can analyze the stability of the fixed points. The stability is determined by the sign of the derivative of the right-hand side, $f(\\phi) = a - \\sin(\\phi)$, evaluated at the fixed point $\\phi^*$. Let's find the derivative:\n$$ f'(\\phi) = \\frac{d}{d\\phi}(a - \\sin(\\phi)) = -\\cos(\\phi) $$\nA fixed point is stable if $f'(\\phi^*)  0$ and unstable if $f'(\\phi^*) > 0$. A bifurcation often occurs when the stability changes, which happens when $f'(\\phi^*) = 0$.\n\nLet's find the conditions for $f'(\\phi^*) = 0$:\n$$ -\\cos(\\phi^*) = 0 \\implies \\phi^* = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi \\quad \\text{for any integer } n. $$\nFor a bifurcation to occur, this value of $\\phi^*$ must also be a fixed point. We must substitute these values of $\\phi^*$ back into the fixed point condition, $\\sin(\\phi^*) = a$.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is even. Let $n=2k$. Then $\\phi^* = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n$$ a = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1 $$\nSo, a bifurcation occurs at $a=1$. At this point, the fixed points are located at $\\phi^* = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is odd. Let $n=2k+1$. Then $\\phi^* = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (2k+1)\\pi = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ (which is equivalent to $-\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2(k+1)\\pi$).\n$$ a = \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right) = -1 $$\nSo, a bifurcation occurs at $a=-1$. At this point, the fixed points are located at $\\phi^* = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$.\n\nFor $|a|  1$, one fixed point is stable ($-\\cos(\\phi^*)0$) and the other is unstable ($-\\cos(\\phi^*)0$). As $a$ approaches $1$ (or $-1$), the stable and unstable fixed points move towards each other, merge at $a=1$ (or $a=-1$) into a single, half-stable fixed point (since $f'(\\phi^*)=0$), and then annihilate each other for $|a| > 1$. This type of bifurcation is known as a saddle-node bifurcation.\n\nTherefore, the qualitative nature of the system's long-term behavior changes at $a=1$ and $a=-1$, as these are the parameter values where the fixed points are created or destroyed.\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. $a=0$ only - Incorrect.\nB. $a=1$ only - Incorrect, misses $a=-1$.\nC. $a=-1$ and $a=1$ - Correct.\nD. $a=-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $a=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ - Incorrect, these are values of $\\phi$, not $a$.\nE. $a=-\\pi$ and $a=\\pi$ - Incorrect.\nF.
