This shows an exchange of stability between $x^{*}=1$ and $x^{*}=r$ as $r$ passes through $1$, with both equilibria existing for all $r$ and intersecting at $(x,r)=(1,1)$.\n\nWe verify the standard nondegeneracy conditions for a transcritical bifurcation at $(x,r)=(1,1)$.

For this system, a bifurcation occurs at the point $(x, r) = (0, 0)$.\n\nThis bifurcation shares some features with a standard saddle-node bifurcation, such as the one found in the system $\\frac{dy}{dt} = r - y^2$ at $(y, r) = (0, 0)$. In both cases, as the parameter $r$ is varied through $r=0$, the number of fixed points changes from zero to two. However, the bifurcation in the system $\\dot{x} = r - x^{2/3}$ is qualitatively different from a standard saddle-node bifurcation.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the fundamental reason for this difference?\n\nA. For $r  0$, both of the created fixed points are stable, whereas in a standard saddle-node bifurcation, one fixed point is stable and the other is unstable.\n\nB. For $r  0$, the bifurcation creates only a single fixed point, not two as required for a saddle-node bifurcation.\n\nC. At the bifurcation point $(x, r) = (0, 0)$, the derivative of the right-hand side with respect to $x$ is undefined, violating a key condition for a standard saddle-node bifurcation where this derivative must be zero.\n\nD. At the bifurcation point $(x, r) = (0, 0)$, the derivative of the right-hand side with respect to the parameter $r$ is zero, which prevents the transversal crossing of the bifurcation point.\n\nE. The bifurcation diagram in the $(r, x)$ plane is symmetric with respect to the $r$-axis (i.e., invariant under $x \\rightarrow -x$), making it a pitchfork bifurcation, not a saddle-node bifurcation.", "solution": "We analyze the vector field $f(x,r) = r - x^{2/3}$.\n\nFixed points satisfy $f(x,r)=0$, i.e.,\n$$\nr - x^{2/3} = 0 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad x^{2/3} = r.\n$$\nFor $r0$, this yields two real equilibria\n$$\nx^{*}_{\\pm}(r) = \\pm r^{3/2}.\n$$\nFor $r=0$, there is the single equilibrium $x^{*}=0$. For $r0$, there are no real equilibria. Thus the number of fixed points changes from zero (for $r0$) to two (for $r0$), as in a saddle-node scenario.\n\nTo compare with a standard saddle-node bifurcation, recall the nondegeneracy and smoothness conditions required at the bifurcation point $(x^{*},r^{*})$:\n$$\nf(x^{*},r^{*}) = 0, \\quad f_{x}(x^{*},r^{*}) = 0, \\quad f_{xx}(x^{*},r^{*}) \\neq 0, \\quad f_{r}(x^{*},r^{*}) \\neq 0,\n$$\nand $f$ must be at least twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of $(x^{*},r^{*})$.\n\nCompute the partial derivatives for $f(x,r)=r - x^{2/3}$:\n$$\nf_{x}(x,r) = -\\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}, \\quad f_{xx}(x,r) = \\frac{2}{9}x^{-4/3}, \\quad f_{r}(x,r) = 1.\n$$\nAt the bifurcation point $(x,r)=(0,0)$, both $f_{x}$ and $f_{xx}$ are undefined (they blow up), while $f_{r}=1 \\neq 0$. Hence $f$ is not differentiable with respect to $x$ at $x=0$, violating the smoothness requirement and, in particular, the condition $f_{x}(x^{*},r^{*})=0$ with $f_{x}$ well-defined.\n\nFor completeness, we check the stability of the two equilibria for $r0$ using the sign of $f_{x}$ at each equilibrium:\n- At $x^{*}_{+} = +r^{3/2}  0$, we have $f_{x}(x^{*}_{+},r) = -\\frac{2}{3}(r^{3/2})^{-1/3}  0$, so $x^{*}_{+}$ is stable.\n- At $x^{*}_{-} = -r^{3/2}  0$, we have $x^{*}_{-}{}^{-1/3}  0$, hence $f_{x}(x^{*}_{-},r) = -\\frac{2}{3}(\\text{negative})  0$, so $x^{*}_{-}$ is unstable.\n\nThus the stability pattern matches the saddle-node picture (one stable and one unstable), contradicting option A. There are indeed two equilibria for $r0$, contradicting option B. The parameter derivative at the bifurcation point is nonzero, $f_{r}=1$, contradicting option D. The diagram is not a pitchfork since there is no persistent equilibrium at $x=0$ for $r \\neq 0$, contradicting option E.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental difference is that the derivative with respect to $x$ is undefined at the bifurcation point, violating the smooth differentiability condition required for a standard saddle-node bifurcation.
