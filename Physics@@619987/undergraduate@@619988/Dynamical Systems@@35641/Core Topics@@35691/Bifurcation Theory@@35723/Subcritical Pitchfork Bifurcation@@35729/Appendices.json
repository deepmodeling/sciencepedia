This first practice explores this fundamental idea by examining the system for a negative parameter value, $r \\lt 0$, before the primary bifurcation occurs. The central principle here is the concept of a \"basin of attraction\": even though the origin is a stable equilibrium, it is not globally stable, and its region of safety is finite. By calculating the width of this basin, you will develop a concrete understanding of how a system can be resilient to small disturbances but vulnerable to larger ones, which is a critical feature of systems prone to sudden, catastrophic shifts [@problem_id:1711774].", "problem": "Consider a simplified one-dimensional dynamical system whose state is described by a variable $x$.

This exercise introduces an imperfection as a parameter $h$, modeling an external influence like a magnetic field, to explore its effect on the system's dynamics. The addition of this term breaks the bifurcation's symmetry, unfolding it and revealing the structure of a hysteresis loop bounded by saddle-node bifurcations. This practice is essential for bridging theory and application, as it allows you to calculate the critical threshold of the external influence required to trigger abrupt jumps between states [@problem_id:1711757].", "problem": "A simplified one-dimensional model for the dynamics of the magnetization $x$ of a certain ferromagnetic material is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = h + rx + x^3 $$\nHere, $t$ represents time.

This means we are looking for the real roots of the cubic polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + rx + h = 0$. The number of real roots of this polynomial depends on the values of the parameters $r$ and $h$.\n\nThe problem states that for a fixed $r<0$, there is a critical value of $h$, called $h_c$, at which two of the equilibrium states merge. Kinetically, this is a saddle-node bifurcation. Mathematically, this corresponds to the cubic function $f(x)$ having a repeated root. A function has a repeated root at a point $x_c$ if both the function and its first derivative are zero at that point.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 + rx + h) = 3x^2 + r $$\nFor a repeated root to exist at $x = x_c$, we must have $f'(x_c) = 0$.\n$$ 3x_c^2 + r = 0 $$\nSolving for $x_c$, we get:\n$$ 3x_c^2 = -r $$\n$$ x_c^2 = -\\frac{r}{3} $$\nSince the problem states that $r$ is a negative constant, $-r$ is positive, and so $-\\frac{r}{3}$ is also positive. Thus, there are two real solutions for $x_c$:\n$$ x_c = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{r}{3}} $$\nThese two values of $x_c$ are the locations of the local extrema of the function $f(x)$. The merging of equilibrium states occurs when one of these extrema is located on the x-axis, meaning $f(x_c)=0$.\n\nNow we enforce the second condition, $f(x_c) = 0$, for the critical values of $h$, which we denote $h_c$.\n$$ x_c^3 + rx_c + h_c = 0 $$\nWe can solve for $h_c$:\n$$ h_c = -x_c^3 - rx_c = -x_c(x_c^2 + r) $$\nWe already found that at the critical points, $x_c^2 = -r/3$. Substituting this into the expression for $h_c$:\n$$ h_c = -x_c\\left(-\\frac{r}{3} + r\\right) = -x_c\\left(\\frac{2r}{3}\\right) $$\nNow we can find the two critical values of $h$ by substituting the two possible values of $x_c$:\n1.
