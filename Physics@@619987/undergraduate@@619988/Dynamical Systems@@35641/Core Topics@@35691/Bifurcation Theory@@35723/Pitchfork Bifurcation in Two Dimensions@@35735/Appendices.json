Since $y^* = x^*$, this gives the fixed point $P_0 = (0, 0)$. This fixed point exists for all values of $\\mu$.\n2.  $\\mu - (x^*)^2 = 0$, which means $(x^*)^2 = \\mu$.\n    - If $\\mu < 0$, there are no real solutions for $x^*$. Thus, for $\\mu < 0$, the only fixed point is $P_0 = (0, 0)$.\n    - If $\\mu = 0$, the only real solution is again $x^*=0$, so $P_0$ is the only fixed point.\n    - If $\\mu > 0$, there are two real solutions: $x^* = \\sqrt{\\mu}$ and $x^* = -\\sqrt{\\mu}$. This gives rise to two new fixed points: $P_+ = (\\sqrt{\\mu}, \\sqrt{\\mu})$ and $P_- = (-\\sqrt{\\mu}, -\\sqrt{\\mu})$.\n\nIn summary, the system has one fixed point $P_0$ for $\\mu \\le 0$, and three fixed points $P_0, P_+, P_-$ for $\\mu > 0$. The fact that one fixed point splits into three as the parameter $\\mu$ crosses zero is characteristic of a pitchfork bifurcation.\n\nNext, to determine the type of pitchfork bifurcation (supercritical or subcritical), we must analyze the stability of these fixed points. We compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system:\n$$\nJ(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{x}}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial \\dot{y}}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu - 3x^2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each fixed point to find its eigenvalues.\n\nStability of $P_0 = (0, 0)$:\nThe Jacobian at the origin is:\n$$\nJ(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince this is a lower triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = \\mu$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\n- For $\\mu < 0$, both eigenvalues are negative ($\\lambda_1 < 0, \\lambda_2 < 0$). Therefore, the fixed point $P_0$ is a stable node.\n- For $\\mu > 0$, one eigenvalue is positive and one is negative ($\\lambda_1 > 0, \\lambda_2 < 0$). Therefore, the fixed point $P_0$ becomes a saddle point.\n\nStability of $P_{\\pm} = (\\pm\\sqrt{\\mu}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu})$ for $\\mu > 0$:\nWe evaluate the Jacobian at these points. Note that $x^2 = (\\pm\\sqrt{\\mu})^2 = \\mu$.\n$$\nJ(\\pm\\sqrt{\\mu}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\mu}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu - 3(\\pm\\sqrt{\\mu})^2 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu - 3\\mu & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2\\mu & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are again the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = -2\\mu$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\nSince we are considering the case $\\mu > 0$, both eigenvalues are negative. Thus, both fixed points $P_+$ and $P_-$ are stable nodes.\n\nLet's summarize the behavior:\n- For $\\mu < 0$, there is a single stable fixed point at the origin.\n- As $\\mu$ increases through $0$, this fixed point becomes unstable (a saddle).\n- For $\\mu > 0$, two new stable fixed points emerge symmetrically about the origin.\n\nThis scenario, where a stable equilibrium loses its stability and gives rise to two new stable equilibria, is the definition of a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation.
