Which of the following best describes the type of bifurcation that occurs at $r=r_c$?\n\nA. Saddle-node bifurcation\n\nB. Transcritical bifurcation\n\nC. Supercritical pitchfork bifurcation\n\nD. Subcritical pitchfork bifurcation\n\nE. Hopf bifurcation", "solution": "Let $f(x;r) = r \\ln(1+x) - x$ on $x-1$, $r0$. Fixed points satisfy $f(x;r)=0$.\n\nFirst, $x=0$ is always a fixed point because $f(0;r)=r\\ln(1)-0=0$. Its stability is given by $f_{x}(x;r)=\\frac{r}{1+x}-1$, so $f_{x}(0;r)=r-1$. Hence $x=0$ is stable for $r1$, unstable for $r1$, and nonhyperbolic at $r=1$. This already indicates a change of stability at $r_{c}=1$.\n\nTo analyze other fixed points, rewrite the fixed-point condition as\n$$\nh(x;r) \\equiv \\ln(1+x) - \\frac{x}{r} = 0.\n$$\nCompute derivatives: $h'(x;r)=\\frac{1}{1+x}-\\frac{1}{r}$ and $h''(x;r)=-\\frac{1}{(1+x)^{2}}0$. Thus $h(\\cdot;r)$ is strictly concave and has a unique critical point (a global maximum) at $h'(x;r)=0$, i.e., at $x=r-1$. The maximum value is\n$$\nh(r-1;r)=\\ln r - \\frac{r-1}{r} \\equiv q(r).\n$$\nDifferentiate $q$: $q'(r)=\\frac{1}{r}-\\frac{1}{r^{2}}=\\frac{r-1}{r^{2}}$, so $q$ has a unique minimum at $r=1$ with $q(1)=0$. Therefore $q(r)\\ge 0$ for all $r0$, with equality only at $r=1$. Since $h(x;r)\\to -\\infty$ as $x\\to -1^{+}$ or $x\\to +\\infty$, strict concavity and $h(0;r)=0$ imply:\n- For $r\\ne 1$, $h$ has exactly two simple zeros: $x=0$ and another $x^{*}(r)\\ne 0$.\n- For $r=1$, $x=0$ is a double root (the two branches coalesce).\n\nLocate $x^{*}(r)$ relative to the maximum at $x=r-1$. For $r1$, $0r-1$, the other root lies on the descending side, so $x^{*}(r)r-10$. For $r1$, $r-10$, the other root lies on the ascending side, so $x^{*}(r)r-10$.\n\nDetermine the stability of $x^{*}(r)$ via $f_{x}(x;r)=\\frac{r}{1+x}-1$. For $r1$, since $x^{*}(r)r-1$, we have $1+x^{*}(r)r$, hence $\\frac{r}{1+x^{*}(r)}1$ and $f_{x}(x^{*}(r);r)0$ (stable). For $r1$, since $x^{*}(r)r-1$, we have $1+x^{*}(r)r$, hence $\\frac{r}{1+x^{*}(r)}1$ and $f_{x}(x^{*}(r);r)0$ (unstable). Thus, as $r$ passes through $1$, the two equilibria $x=0$ and $x=x^{*}(r)$ exchange stability.\n\nA normal-form check around $(x,r)=(0,1)$ confirms a transcritical bifurcation. Let $\\mu=r-1$ and expand:\n$$\nf(x;r)=(1+\\mu)\\ln(1+x)-x=(1+\\mu)\\left(x-\\frac{x^{2}}{2}+\\frac{x^{3}}{3}+\\cdots\\right)-x\n=\\mu x-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}+O(\\mu x^{2},x^{3}),\n$$\nwhich is the transcritical normal form (up to scaling). The nondegeneracy conditions hold: $f(0;r)\\equiv 0$, $f_{x}(0;1)=0$, $f_{xx}(0;1)=-1\\ne 0$, and $f_{xr}(0;1)=1\\ne 0$.\n\nTherefore, the bifurcation at $r_{c}=1$ is a transcritical bifurcation.\n\nPitchfork bifurcations require a symmetry that is absent here, and a Hopf bifurcation cannot occur in one-dimensional flows, so the only consistent choice is transcritical.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1724839"}]}
