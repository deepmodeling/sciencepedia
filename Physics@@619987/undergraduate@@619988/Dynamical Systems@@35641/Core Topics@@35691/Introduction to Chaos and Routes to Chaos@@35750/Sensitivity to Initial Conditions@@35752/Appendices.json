For a one-dimensional discrete map $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$, the finite-time Lyapunov exponent is defined for a given initial condition $x_0$. For many systems, particularly ergodic ones, this value converges to a single number independent of the initial condition for almost all $x_0$. In such cases, the Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda$ can be calculated as a spatial average over the phase space, weighted by the system's natural invariant measure, $\\rho(x)$.
