The population value $x_n$ is always confined to the interval $[0, 1]$.\n\nFor certain values of $r$, the population evolves towards a stable equilibrium value, known as a fixed point, where $x_{n+1} = x_n$. The logistic map has two such fixed points: a trivial one representing extinction ($x=0$) and a non-trivial one whose value depends on $r$.\n\nThe stability of a fixed point $x^*$ is determined by the local behavior of the map. If the magnitude of the slope of the function $f(x)$ at the fixed point, denoted $|f'(x^*)|$, is less than 1, the fixed point is stable, and the population will converge to it. If $|f'(x^*)| > 1$, the fixed point is unstable, and the population will move away from it. As the parameter $r$ is slowly increased, the system can undergo a critical transition where the non-trivial fixed point loses its stability.

For $r > 1$, $x_2^*$ becomes positive and distinct from $x_1^*=0$. At $r=1$, we have $f'(x_2^*) = 2-1 = 1$. This event is known as a transcritical bifurcation, where the fixed point is born, but it is not the transition that gives rise to a period-2 orbit.\n\nFor the non-trivial fixed point to exist and be in the domain $(0,1]$, we must have $r>1$.\nNow consider $r=3$. At this value, $f'(x_2^*) = 2 - 3 = -1$.\nFor $1 < r < 3$, we have $2-r$ between $-1$ and $1$, so $|f'(x_2^*)| = |2-r| < 1$.
