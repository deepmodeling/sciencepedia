For a 2-cycle, this means the critical point is one of the two points in the cycle. Let the two points be $x_A$ and $x_B$. A 2-cycle is defined by the relations $f(x_A) = x_B$ and $f(x_B) = x_A$.\nFor a superstable 2-cycle, we can set one of these points to be the critical point, say $x_A = x_c = 1/2$.\nThen the conditions for the cycle become:\n1. $f(1/2) = x_B$\n2. $f(x_B) = 1/2$\n\nCombining these two conditions, we can write $f(f(1/2)) = 1/2$.
