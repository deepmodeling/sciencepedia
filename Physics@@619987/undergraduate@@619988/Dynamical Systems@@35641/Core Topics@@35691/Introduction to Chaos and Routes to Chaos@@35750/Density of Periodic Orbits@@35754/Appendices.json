The position of a particle on the main circular axis of the torus is tracked by a variable $x \\in [0, 1)$, which represents its angular position normalized by $2\\pi$. At each discrete time step, the particle's position is updated according to the function $f(x) = kx \\pmod 1$, where $k$ is an integer greater than 1, and the operation '$a \\pmod 1$' gives the fractional part of $a$ (for example, $3.14 \\pmod 1 = 0.14$). For this particular system, the mixing constant is $k=3$, so the map is $f(x) = 3x \\pmod 1$.\n\nA point $x_0$ is called a *periodic point* if there exists a positive integer $n$ (called the period) such that the particle returns to its starting position after $n$ iterations.
