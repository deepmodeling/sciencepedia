As the parameter $r$ is slowly increased, the long-term behavior of the insect population undergoes a series of changes. For low $r$, the population settles to a stable equilibrium. As $r$ increases, the population begins to oscillate between a set of distinct values, with the number of values in the set successively doubling.\n\nThese changes, known as period-doubling bifurcations, occur at specific values of the parameter $r$.
