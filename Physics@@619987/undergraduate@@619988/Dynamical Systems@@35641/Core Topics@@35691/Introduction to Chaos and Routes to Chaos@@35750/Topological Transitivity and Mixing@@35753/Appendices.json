We will analyze each map separately using the given properties and the definition of topological transitivity.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of $f^2$ on $X$**\n\nTo check if $f^2$ is topologically transitive on $X$, we must verify if for *every* pair of non-empty open sets $U, V \\subset X$, there exists an integer $k > 0$ such that $(f^2)^k(U) \\cap V \\neq \\emptyset$. If we can find even one pair $(U, V)$ for which this condition fails for all $k > 0$, then $f^2$ is not transitive.\n\nLet's consider the action of $f^2$ on the two intervals $I_1$ and $I_2$.\n- If we take any point $x \\in I_1$, its first iterate $f(x)$ must be in $I_2$ due to property 1 ($f(I_1) = I_2$).\n- The second iterate is $f^2(x) = f(f(x))$. Since $f(x) \\in I_2$, its image $f(f(x))$ must be in $I_1$ due to property 1 ($f(I_2) = I_1$).\n- Therefore, for any $x \\in I_1$, we have $f^2(x) \\in I_1$. This means $f^2$ maps the interval $I_1$ to itself: $f^2(I_1) \\subseteq I_1$.\n- Similarly, for any $y \\in I_2$, $f(y) \\in I_1$, and $f^2(y) = f(f(y)) \\in I_2$. So, $f^2$ also maps $I_2$ to itself: $f^2(I_2) \\subseteq I_2$.\n\nThe space $X$ is thus decomposed into two disjoint sets, $I_1$ and $I_2$, which are invariant under the map $f^2$. This means that an orbit starting in $I_1$ under $f^2$ can never enter $I_2$, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's choose a pair of open sets to test the definition of transitivity. Let $U$ be any non-empty open set completely contained in $I_1$ (for instance, $U = (0.2, 0.3)$) and let $V$ be any non-empty open set completely contained in $I_2$ (for instance, $V = (2.2, 2.3)$).\n\nSince $U \\subset I_1$ and $f^2$ maps $I_1$ to itself, the first iterate is $(f^2)^1(U) \\subset I_1$. By induction, for any positive integer $k$, the $k$-th iterate $(f^2)^k(U)$ must also be a subset of $I_1$.\nThe intersection with $V$ is therefore $(f^2)^k(U) \\cap V \\subseteq I_1 \\cap V$. Since $V \\subset I_2$ and the intervals $I_1$ and $I_2$ are disjoint, $I_1 \\cap V = \\emptyset$.\nThus, $(f^2)^k(U) \\cap V = \\emptyset$ for all $k > 0$.\n\nWe have found a pair of non-empty open sets $(U, V)$ for which the condition of topological transitivity is not met. Therefore, the map $f^2$ is not topologically transitive on the whole space $X$. This allows us to eliminate options A and C.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of $f$ on $X$**\n\nNow we analyze the transitivity of the original map $f$. We must show that for *any* pair of non-empty open sets $U, V \\subset X$, there exists an integer $n > 0$ such that $f^n(U) \\cap V \\neq \\emptyset$.\n\nLet $U$ and $V$ be arbitrary non-empty open sets in $X$. Since $X = I_1 \\cup I_2$, $U$ must have a non-empty intersection with at least one interval, and the same is true for $V$. Let's pick non-empty open subsets $U' \\subseteq U$ and $V' \\subseteq V$ such that $U'$ is entirely in one interval and $V'$ is entirely in one interval. Specifically, let $U' \\subset I_i$ and $V' \\subset I_j$ for some $i, j \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. If we can show that an iterate of $f$ sends $U'$ into $V'$, then $f^n(U) \\cap V$ will also be non-empty. This leads to four cases based on the locations of $U'$ and $V'$.\n\nBefore proceeding to the cases, we need to establish the dynamics on $I_2$. We are given that $g_1 = f^2|_{I_1}$ is transitive on $I_1$. Let's analyze $g_2 = f^2|_{I_2}$. Let $f_1 = f|_{I_1}: I_1 \\to I_2$ and $f_2 = f|_{I_2}: I_2 \\to I_1$. Since $f$ is a homeomorphism (property 2), $f_1$ and $f_2$ are homeomorphisms between the intervals.\nWe can write $g_1 = f_2 \\circ f_1$ and $g_2 = f_1 \\circ f_2$.\nFrom $g_2 = f_1 \\circ f_2$, we can write $f_2 = f_1^{-1} \\circ g_2$. Substituting this into the expression for $g_1$:\n$g_1 = (f_1^{-1} \\circ g_2) \\circ f_1 = f_1^{-1} \\circ g_2 \\circ f_1$.\nThis means $g_1$ and $g_2$ are topologically conjugate via the homeomorphism $f_1$. Since topological transitivity is preserved under topological conjugacy, and we are given that $g_1$ is transitive on $I_1$, it follows that $g_2$ must be transitive on $I_2$.\n\nNow we can examine the four cases:\n*   **Case 1: $U' \\subset I_1, V' \\subset I_1$.** The map that preserves the interval $I_1$ is $f^2$. We know that $g_1 = f^2|_{I_1}$ is transitive on $I_1$ by property 3. Therefore, for the non-empty open sets $U', V' \\subset I_1$, there exists an integer $k > 0$ such that $(g_1)^k(U') \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$. This is equivalent to $(f^2)^k(U') \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$. So we can choose $n = 2k$.\n*   **Case 2: $U' \\subset I_2, V' \\subset I_2$.** The map that preserves the interval $I_2$ is $f^2$. As we've just shown, $g_2 = f^2|_{I_2}$ is transitive on $I_2$. Thus, for the non-empty open sets $U', V' \\subset I_2$, there exists $k > 0$ such that $(g_2)^k(U') \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$. This is $(f^2)^k(U') \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$. We can choose $n = 2k$.\n*   **Case 3: $U' \\subset I_1, V' \\subset I_2$.** First, we apply $f$ once. Let $U'' = f(U')$. Since $f$ is a homeomorphism and $U' \\subset I_1$, $U''$ is a non-empty open set in $I_2$. Now the problem is to find an iterate that sends the open set $U'' \\subset I_2$ to intersect the open set $V' \\subset I_2$. This is an instance of Case 2. We know there exists $k > 0$ such that $(f^2)^k(U'') \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$. Substituting $U'' = f(U')$, we get $(f^2)^k(f(U')) \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$, which simplifies to $f^{2k+1}(U') \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$. We can choose $n = 2k+1$.\n*   **Case 4: $U' \\subset I_2, V' \\subset I_1$.** This is symmetric to Case 3. First, apply $f$ to get $U'' = f(U') \\subset I_1$, which is a non-empty open set. Now we need to find an iterate sending $U'' \\subset I_1$ to intersect $V' \\subset I_1$. This is an instance of Case 1. There exists $k > 0$ such that $(f^2)^k(U'') \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$. Substituting back, we have $f^{2k+1}(U') \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$. We can choose $n = 2k+1$.\n\nIn all possible cases, we can find a positive integer $n$ such that $f^n(U') \\cap V' \\neq \\emptyset$. This implies that $f$ is topologically transitive on the entire space $X$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that $f$ is topologically transitive on $X$, but $f^2$ is not.
