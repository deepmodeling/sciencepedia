The map $f$ is the $3$-cycle $A \\mapsto B \\mapsto C \\mapsto A$. The metric is the discrete metric $d(x,y)=0$ if $x=y$ and $d(x,y)=1$ if $x \\neq y$.\n\nTopological transitivity: Let $U,V \\subseteq X$ be arbitrary non-empty open sets.

Therefore $f$ is topologically transitive.\n\nDense periodic points: For each $x \\in X$, we have $f^{3}(x)=x$, so every point is periodic (in fact, of period $3$). Thus the set of periodic points $P$ equals $X$. For any non-empty open $U \\subseteq X$, $P \\cap U = U \\neq \\emptyset$, so periodic points are dense.\n\nSensitive dependence on initial conditions: The definition requires the existence of $\\delta>0$ such that for any $x \\in X$ and any open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, there exists $y \\in U$ with $y \\neq x$ and $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $d\\bigl(f^{n}(x),f^{n}(y)\\bigr)>\\delta$. In the discrete topology, the singleton $\\{x\\}$ is an open neighborhood of $x$. Taking $U=\\{x\\}$, there is no $y \\in U$ with $y \\neq x$, so the existential condition on $y$ fails. This shows that no such $\\delta$ can satisfy the sensitivity condition.

From the iterate description, for $x\\in[0,0.5)$ we have $f^{p}(x)=0.2$ for all $p\\geq 1$, so $x$ can be periodic only if $x=0.2$. Similarly, for $x\\in[0.5,1]$, $f^{p}(x)=0.8$ for all $p\\geq 1$, so $x$ can be periodic only if $x=0.8$. Therefore the set of periodic points is exactly $\\{0.2,0.8\\}$, which is not dense in $X$.
