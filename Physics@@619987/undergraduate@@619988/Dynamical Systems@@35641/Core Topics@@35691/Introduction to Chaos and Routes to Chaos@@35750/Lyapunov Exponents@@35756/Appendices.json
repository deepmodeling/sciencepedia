An initial signal value $x_0$ is transformed through successive iterations according to the rule $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$. This process is designed to be chaotic, meaning that two initially very close signal values will diverge exponentially over time. The rate of this exponential divergence is quantified by the Lyapunov exponent, $\\lambda$.\n\nFor a one-dimensional map $f(x)$, the Lyapunov exponent can be calculated as a spatial average over the system's state space, weighted by its invariant probability density function, $\\rho(x)$.
