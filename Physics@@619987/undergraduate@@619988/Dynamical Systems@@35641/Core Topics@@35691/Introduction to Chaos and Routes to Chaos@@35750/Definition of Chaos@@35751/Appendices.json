More formally, a map $f: X \\to X$ is transitive if for any pair of non-empty open subsets $U, V \\subset X$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that the $n$-th iteration of $U$ under $f$, denoted $f^n(U)$, has a non-empty intersection with $V$.\n\nConsider the disconnected one-dimensional space defined by the union of two intervals, $X = [0, 1] \\cup [2, 3]$. Let the standard tent map on the unit interval be defined as\n$$ T(y) = \\begin{cases} 2y & \\text{if } y \\in [0, 1/2] \\\\ 2(1-y) & \\text{if } y \\in (1/2, 1] \\end{cases} $$\nNow, consider two different maps from the space $X$ to itself, $F_A: X \\to X$ and $F_B: X \\to X$, constructed using the tent map $T$.\n\nMap A is defined as:\n$$ F_A(x) = \\begin{cases} T(x) & \\text{if } x \\in [0,1] \\\\ T(x-2)+2 & \\text{if } x \\in [2,3] \\end{cases} $$\nMap B is defined as:\n$$ F_B(x) = \\begin{cases} T(x)+2 & \\text{if } x \\in [0,1] \\\\ T(x-2) & \\text{if } x \\in [2,3] \\end{cases} $$\n\nOne of these maps, $F_A$ or $F_B$, is topologically transitive on the entire space $X$, while the other is not. Your task is to determine the sum of all fixed points of the map that is **not** transitive.", "solution": "We determine which map is not topologically transitive and then compute the sum of its fixed points.\n\nFirst, observe the images of the components under each map.\n\nFor $F_{A}$:\n- If $x \\in [0,1]$, then $F_{A}(x) = T(x) \\in [0,1]$.\n- If $x \\in [2,3]$, then $x-2 \\in [0,1]$, so $T(x-2) \\in [0,1]$, hence $F_{A}(x) = T(x-2)+2 \\in [2,3]$.\n\nThus each interval $[0,1]$ and $[2,3]$ is forward-invariant under $F_{A}$. Take any nonempty open $U \\subset [0,1]$ and $V \\subset [2,3]$. Then for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $F_{A}^{n}(U) \\subset [0,1]$, so $F_{A}^{n}(U) \\cap V = \\varnothing$. By the definition of topological transitivity, $F_{A}$ is not transitive on $X$.\n\nFor $F_{B}$:\n- If $x \\in [0,1]$, then $F_{B}(x) = T(x)+2 \\in [2,3]$.\n- If $x \\in [2,3]$, then $x-2 \\in [0,1]$, so $F_{B}(x) = T(x-2) \\in [0,1]$.\n\nHence $F_{B}$ swaps the two components at each iteration. For $x \\in [0,1]$, compute the second iterate:\n$$\nF_{B}^{2}(x) = F_{B}(T(x)+2) = T\\big((T(x)+2)-2\\big) = T(T(x)) = T^{2}(x).\n$$\nSimilarly, for $y \\in [2,3]$ with $z = y-2 \\in [0,1]$,\n$$\nF_{B}^{2}(y) = F_{B}(T(z)) = T(T(z)) + 2.\n$$\nThus $F_{B}^{2}$ restricts to $T^{2}$ on $[0,1]$ and to $T^{2}+2$ on $[2,3]$ (via the identification $[2,3] \\leftrightarrow [0,1]$ by shift by $2$). The standard tent map $T$ on $[0,1]$ is topologically mixing (hence transitive), so $T^{2}$ is also transitive on $[0,1]$. Therefore, given any nonempty open sets $U,V \\subset X$, if $U$ and $V$ lie in the same component, choose an even $n$ so that $F_{B}^{n}$ acts as $T^{2m}$ on that component and ensures intersection; if they lie in different components, choose an odd $n$ to swap once and use the transitivity of $T^{2}$ to achieve intersection. Hence $F_{B}$ is topologically transitive on $X$.\n\nConsequently, the non-transitive map is $F_{A}$. We now compute the sum of all fixed points of $F_{A}$.\n\nFixed points in $[0,1]$ solve $T(x)=x$. There are two cases:\n- If $x \\in [0,\\frac{1}{2}]$, then $T(x)=2x$, so $2x=x \\implies x=0$.\n- If $x \\in (\\frac{1}{2},1]$, then $T(x)=2(1-x)$, so $2(1-x)=x \\implies 2=3x \\implies x=\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nFixed points in $[2,3]$ solve $T(x-2)+2=x$. Let $z=x-2 \\in [0,1]$. Then $T(z)=x-2=z$, so $z$ must be a fixed point of $T$ on $[0,1]$, namely $z=0$ or $z=\\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore $x=2$ or $x=2+\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\nThus the fixed points of $F_{A}$ on $X$ are $0$, $\\frac{2}{3}$, $2$, and $\\frac{8}{3}$, and their sum is\n$$\n0+\\frac{2}{3}+2+\\frac{8}{3} = 2 + \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{16}{3}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{16}{3}}$$", "id": "1671405"}, {"introduction": "Paradoxically, the unpredictable nature of chaos is built upon an infinitely complex but highly structured foundation of periodic orbits.

For example, a possible state is $(S_A, S_B, S_A, S_A, \\dots)$. The system evolves in discrete time steps. The evolution is governed by a simple \"shift\" rule: at each step, the first symbol in the sequence is observed and removed, and the rest of the sequence is shifted one position to the left to form the new state.\n\nTo analyze the dynamics, each state sequence $s = (s_1, s_2, s_3, \\dots)$ is mapped to a real number $x$ in the interval $[0, 1]$ via a binary representation. The mapping is defined as $x = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_k 2^{-k}$, where the coefficient $c_k = 0$ if the symbol $s_k$ is $S_A$, and $c_k = 1$ if the symbol $s_k$ is $S_B$.\n\nA state sequence is considered to be part of a periodic orbit of period $p$ if applying the evolution rule $p$ times yields the original sequence, and $p$ is the smallest positive integer for which this occurs.\n\nDetermine the smallest positive real number $x$ that corresponds to a state sequence belonging to a period-5 orbit.

Under the binary mapping $x=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} c_{k}2^{-k}$, the left-shift of the sequence corresponds to the map $T(x)=2x \\bmod 1$. Thus $x$ belongs to a period-5 orbit if and only if $T^{5}(x)=x$ and $T^{k}(x)\\neq x$ for $1\\leq k<5$, which is equivalent to $x$ having a purely periodic binary expansion with minimal period $5$.\n\nTo obtain the smallest positive $x$ among such sequences, we must minimize the lexicographic order of the binary expansion, which is achieved by maximizing the number of leading zeros subject to the constraint that the period is exactly $5$. In any 5-periodic binary sequence, within the first $5$ digits there must be at least one $1$ for the number to be positive. Placing the first $1$ as late as possible in the first block gives the block $(0,0,0,0,1)$, repeated. This block is primitive because $5$ is prime and it is not constant, so its minimal period is $5$ (it cannot have period $1$).\n\nTherefore, the binary expansion of the smallest positive $x$ is\n$$\nx=0.\\overline{00001}_{2}=\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}2^{-5m}.\n$$\nThis is a geometric series with first term $2^{-5}$ and ratio $2^{-5}$, so\n$$\nx=\\frac{2^{-5}}{1-2^{-5}}=\\frac{1}{2^{5}-1}=\\frac{1}{31}.\n$$\nThis $x$ indeed has exact period $5$ under the shift, since the block $(0,0,0,0,1)$ is not equal to any of its nontrivial rotations, and $5$ is the smallest positive period.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{31}}$$", "id": "1671392"}, {"introduction": "Many simple systems do not start out chaotic but can become so as a parameter is changed, following a distinct 'route to chaos'.
