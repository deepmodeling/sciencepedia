One such route is intermittency, where for certain values of the parameter $r$, the system's trajectory alternates between long, nearly periodic phases (laminar phases) and short, erratic, chaotic bursts.\n\nConsider a sequence of data points $\\{x_n\\}$ generated by the logistic map for a parameter $r$ near the period-3 window, where the laminar phase shows a near-period-3 behavior.
