For a 2x2 linear system, a saddle point occurs when the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ are real and have opposite signs (one positive, one negative). A necessary and sufficient condition for this is that the determinant of the matrix is negative, i.e., $\\det(A)  0$.\n\nSecond, the stable manifold of the saddle point must be the line $y=2x$. The stable manifold consists of all initial points whose trajectories approach the origin as time $t \\to \\infty$. For a saddle point, this manifold is a straight line coinciding with the eigenspace of the negative eigenvalue. The line $y=2x$ can be represented by any vector parallel to it, for instance, $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Therefore, this condition means that $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ must be an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to a negative eigenvalue.\n\nWe will now test each option against these two conditions.\n\n**A. $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -6 \\\\ 0  -2 \\end{pmatrix}$**\n1.  **Saddle Point Check:** The determinant is $\\det(A) = (1)(-2) - (0)(-6) = -2$.

The negative eigenvalue is $\\lambda_2 = -2$.

This matches the required stable manifold. Thus, C is correct.\n\n**D. $A = \\begin{pmatrix} -4  3 \\\\ -6  5 \\end{pmatrix}$**\n1.  **Saddle Point Check:** The determinant is $\\det(A) = (-4)(5) - (-6)(3) = -20 + 18 = -2$. Since $\\det(A)  0$, the origin is a saddle point. The trace is $\\text{tr}(A) = -4 + 5 = 1$. The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 - \\lambda - 2 = 0 \\implies (\\lambda-2)(\\lambda+1) = 0$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\n2.  **Stable Manifold Check:** The negative eigenvalue is $\\lambda_2 = -1$.

This is not the required stable manifold. Thus, D is incorrect. (Note that the eigenvector for the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=2$ is given by $-6x+3y=0$, or $y=2x$. So for this matrix, $y=2x$ is the unstable manifold).\n\n**E. $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ -5  -4 \\end{pmatrix}$**\n1.  **Saddle Point Check:** The determinant is $\\det(A) = (0)(-4) - (1)(-5) = 5$. Since $\\det(A)  0$, the origin is not a saddle point. The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2+4\\lambda+5=0$. The discriminant is $4^2 - 4(1)(5) = 16-20 = -4  0$, which means eigenvalues are complex, corresponding to a spiral.
