A qualitative analysis of the vector field in the plane has identified all of the system's fixed points. In the first quadrant, including its boundaries (i.e., for $x \\ge 0$ and $y \\ge 0$), there are exactly three fixed points with the following locations and stability types:\n1. A stable node located at the origin, $(0, 0)$.\n2. A saddle point located at $(1, 0)$ on the x-axis.\n3. A saddle point located at $(0, 1)$ on the y-axis.\n\nThere are no other fixed points in the entire plane. Based on this information, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and topologically robust description of the long-term behavior of trajectories that start within the open first quadrant (i.e., for $x  0$ and $y  0$)?\n\nA. The first quadrant is divided into two distinct regions. Trajectories starting in one region, which is bounded and contains the origin, will approach the stable node at $(0,0)$. Trajectories starting in the other, unbounded region will have at least one coordinate, $x$ or $y$, tend to infinity as time progresses.\n\nB. All trajectories that start in the first quadrant will eventually approach the stable node at $(0,0)$.\n\nC. All trajectories that start in the first quadrant will eventually have at least one coordinate, $x$ or $y$, tend to infinity as time progresses.\n\nD. Trajectories that start in the first quadrant will either approach the saddle point at $(1,0)$ or the saddle point at $(0,1)$.\n\nE. All trajectories that start in the first quadrant are periodic, forming closed orbits around the stable node at $(0,0)$.", "solution": "We are given a planar autonomous system\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=f(x,y),\\qquad \\frac{dy}{dt}=g(x,y),\n$$\nwith exactly three equilibria in the closed first quadrant: a stable node at $(0,0)$, and saddles at $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$; there are no other equilibria anywhere in the plane. We are asked to characterize the long-term behavior for initial data with $x0$ and $y0$.\n\nStep 1: Classification of possible omega-limit sets in two dimensions. By the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem, if a trajectory is bounded, then its omega-limit set is either:\n- an equilibrium point,\n- a periodic orbit, or\n- a union of equilibria and heteroclinic/homoclinic connections between them.\nSince the only equilibria are the three specified, any bounded trajectory’s omega-limit set must involve only these points and possible connecting orbits.\n\nStep 2: Saddles are not attractors except along their stable manifolds. For a saddle, the stable manifold theorem implies that the set of initial conditions whose forward trajectories converge to the saddle is a one-dimensional embedded curve (the stable manifold) passing through the saddle. In the plane, this is of measure zero and does not form an open region. Therefore, trajectories started in the open first quadrant will approach a saddle only if they lie exactly on a stable manifold branch of that saddle. This behavior is not topologically robust and does not describe the fate of a full region of initial data. Hence, option D cannot describe the generic long-term behavior.\n\nStep 3: Basin of attraction of the stable node at the origin. Because $(0,0)$ is a stable node, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $(0,0)$ such that all solutions starting in $U$ converge to $(0,0)$. Therefore, not all trajectories escape; this excludes option C. Likewise, not all trajectories necessarily approach $(0,0)$, because saddles typically generate separatrices that bound the basin of attraction and can lead trajectories away; this excludes option B.\n\nStep 4: Excluding periodic orbits entirely contained in the open first quadrant. Suppose there were a periodic orbit $\\gamma$ entirely contained in $\\{(x,y): x0,y0\\}$. By the Jordan curve theorem, the interior of $\\gamma$ would be a subset of the open first quadrant and hence would contain none of the three equilibria, because all three lie on the axes. For a simple closed periodic orbit, the Poincaré index of the vector field along $\\gamma$ is $1$, and it must equal the sum of the indices of the equilibria enclosed by $\\gamma$. Since no equilibria are enclosed, this sum would be $0$, a contradiction. Therefore, there is no periodic orbit entirely contained in the open first quadrant.\n\nStep 5: Structure of the basin boundary and alternatives to convergence to $(0,0)$. The basin of attraction of $(0,0)$ in the plane is an open set containing the origin. In the first quadrant, its intersection is a region that is bounded by invariant sets such as the stable manifolds of the saddles and, possibly, a periodic orbit that crosses the axes and encloses the origin. Such a periodic orbit, if present, can serve as a boundary component of the basin; it cannot attract an open set of initial conditions in the first quadrant and is non-generic as a terminal fate for initial conditions in an open region. Points not in the basin of attraction of $(0,0)$ cannot converge to other equilibria (except on measure-zero sets) and, by Step 4, cannot have omega-limit sets that are periodic orbits wholly confined in the open first quadrant. Thus, for trajectories starting in the open first quadrant that are not in the basin of $(0,0)$ (and not on exceptional invariant sets), the only robust alternative is that the trajectories are unbounded in forward time.\n\nStep 6: Interpreting “tend to infinity.” If a trajectory is unbounded in forward time, then at least one coordinate must become unbounded as time increases. Hence, initial conditions outside the bounded basin region give rise to trajectories for which at least one of $x$ or $y$ tends to infinity as time progresses.\n\nStep 7: Synthesis and choice among the options. Combining the above:\n- There is a bounded region in the first quadrant (containing the origin) forming the basin of attraction of the stable node $(0,0)$; trajectories starting there approach $(0,0)$.\n- Outside that region, trajectories do not generically approach the saddles and cannot be contained in periodic orbits wholly within the open first quadrant; hence the robust behavior is that they are unbounded so that at least one of $x$ or $y$ tends to infinity.\n- This matches the content of option A.\nOptions B, C, D, and E contradict one or more of the established properties above.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and topologically robust description is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1698492"}]}
