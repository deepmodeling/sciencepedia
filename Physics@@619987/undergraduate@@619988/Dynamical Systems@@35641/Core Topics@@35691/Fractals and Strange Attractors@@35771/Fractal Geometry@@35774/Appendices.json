We begin with the set $C_0 = [0, 1]$, the closed interval from 0 to 1.

This leaves us with $C_1 = [0, \\frac{1}{3}] \\cup [\\frac{2}{3}, 1]$. We continue this process indefinitely: to get $C_{n+1}$ from $C_n$, we remove the open middle third of every interval in $C_n$. The Cantor set $C$ is the set of all points that remain after this process is repeated an infinite number of times.\n\nAny point $p$ in the Cantor set can be uniquely identified by a ternary (base-3) address, written as an infinite sequence of digits $0.d_1 d_2 d_3...$ where each digit $d_k$ is either 0 or 2.

The path to this point involves choosing the right sub-interval at the first step, the left sub-interval at the second step, the right sub-interval at the third step, and so on, alternating between right and left choices indefinitely.

In this case, $c=i$ and the point we are interested in is $z_0 = 0$. Therefore, we need to compute the orbit of the origin under the map $f_i(z) = z^2 + i$ and check if this orbit is bounded.\n\nThe orbit is the sequence $\\{z_n\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ where $z_{n+1} = f_i(z_n) = z_n^2 + i$. We start with $z_0 = 0$.\n\nLet's compute the first few terms of the orbit:\n-   For $n=0$: $z_0 = 0$.\n-   For $n=1$: $z_1 = f_i(z_0) = (0)^2 + i = i$.\n-   For $n=2$: $z_2 = f_i(z_1) = (i)^2 + i = -1 + i$.\n-   For $n=3$: $z_3 = f_i(z_2) = (-1 + i)^2 + i$. We expand the square: $(-1 + i)^2 = (-1)^2 + 2(-1)(i) + i^2 = 1 - 2i - 1 = -2i$. So, $z_3 = -2i + i = -i$.\n-   For $n=4$: $z_4 = f_i(z_3) = (-i)^2 + i = i^2 + i = -1 + i$.\n\nAt this point, we observe that $z_4 = z_2$. Since the next term in the sequence depends only on the current term, the orbit will now repeat the cycle $z_2, z_3, z_2, z_3, \\dots$. Specifically:\n-   $z_5 = f_i(z_4) = f_i(z_2) = z_3 = -i$.\n-   $z_6 = f_i(z_5) = f_i(z_3) = z_4 = -1 + i$.\n\nThe full orbit of the origin is the sequence $0, i, -1+i, -i, -1+i, -i, \\dots$.\nThe set of points visited by this orbit is $\\{0, i, -1+i, -i\\}$.\n\nNow, we must determine if this orbit is bounded. An orbit is bounded if there is a real number $R$ such that the magnitude $|z_n| \\le R$ for all $n \\ge 0$. Let's calculate the magnitudes of the points in the orbit:\n-   $|z_0| = |0| = 0$.\n-   $|z_1| = |i| = \\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2} = 1$.\n-   $|z_2| = |-1 + i| = \\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}$.\n-   $|z_3| = |-i| = \\sqrt{0^2 + (-1)^2} = 1$.\n\nSince the orbit repeats the points $-1+i$ and $-i$ after the initial terms, the magnitudes of all points in the orbit will be drawn from the set $\\{0, 1, \\sqrt{2}\\}$. The maximum magnitude in this set is $\\sqrt{2}$. We can choose $R = \\sqrt{2}$ (or any number greater than $\\sqrt{2}$, like $R=2$). Since $|z_n| \\le \\sqrt{2}$ for all $n \\ge 0$, the orbit of the origin is bounded.\n\nBy the definition of the filled Julia set, since the orbit of $z_0=0$ is bounded, the point $z_0=0$ is an element of the filled Julia set $K_i$. This means the answer starts with \"Yes...\".\n\nNow we must choose the correct reason from the multiple-choice options. The problem statement defines the critical point for this family of maps as $z_{crit} = 0$. Therefore, the orbit of the origin that we just calculated is also the orbit of the critical point.
