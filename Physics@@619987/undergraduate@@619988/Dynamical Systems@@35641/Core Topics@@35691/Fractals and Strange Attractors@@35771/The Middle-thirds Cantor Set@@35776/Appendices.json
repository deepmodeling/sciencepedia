This practice will challenge you to apply the rule that a point belongs to the Cantor set if and only if it has a ternary representation using only the digits 0 and 2, allowing you to discover a point that lives within the set but is not one of its construction endpoints. [@problem_id:1718733]", "problem": "The middle-thirds Cantor set, denoted by $C$, is a subset of the interval $[0, 1]$ constructed by an iterative process. We begin with the set $C_0 = [0, 1]$.

This process is repeated indefinitely. The set $C_n$ is the union of $2^n$ closed intervals, and $C_{n+1}$ is obtained by removing the open middle third of each of these intervals. The Cantor set is the intersection of all these sets: $C = \\bigcap_{n=0}^{\\infty} C_n$.\n\nThe endpoints of the intervals that constitute the sets $C_n$ are members of the Cantor set.

This follows because at the $n$-th step, removing the open middle third forbids the $n$-th ternary digit from being $1$, and the intersection over all $n$ forbids digit $1$ in every place.\n\nEndpoints of the construction intervals arise at finite steps and therefore are rational numbers of the form $m/3^{n}$ for some nonnegative integers $m,n$.
