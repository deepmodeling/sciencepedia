The attractor for this IFS must lie within $[0, 1]$. A good choice for the initial set is $S_0 = [0, 1]$ itself. We apply the transformations to this set.\n\n$T_1(S_0) = T_1([0, 1]) = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(0), \\frac{1}{2}(1)\\right] = \\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]$\n$T_2(S_0) = T_2([0, 1]) = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}(1) + \\frac{1}{2}\\right] = \\left[\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right]$\n$T_3(S_0) = T_3([0, 1]) = \\left[\\frac{1}{4}(0) + \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}(1) + \\frac{1}{4}\\right] = \\left[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]$\n\nThe first iteration gives the set $S_1 = W(S_0) = T_1(S_0) \\cup T_2(S_0) \\cup T_3(S_0)$.\n$S_1 = \\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right] \\cup \\left[\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right] \\cup \\left[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]$\n\nWe observe that the third set, $[\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}]$, is a subset of the first set, $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$. Therefore, their union is just $[0, \\frac{1}{2}]$.\nSo, the union simplifies to:\n$S_1 = \\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right] \\cup \\left[\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right] = [0, 1]$\n\nSince $W(S_0) = S_0$, the set $S_0 = [0, 1]$ is invariant under the transformation $W$. By the definition of the attractor as the unique compact invariant set, the attractor for this IFS is $A = [0, 1]$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Hausdorff dimension of the attractor.**\nThe attractor $A$ is the standard closed interval $[0, 1]$. This is a simple geometric object, not a fractal. The Hausdorff dimension of a line segment is known to be exactly 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the distractors and the similarity dimension formula.**\nSome of the options are derived from the similarity dimension formula. For an IFS consisting of $N$ similarity transformations with contraction ratios $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_N$, the similarity dimension $D$ is the solution to the equation:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i^D = 1 $$\nThis formula is only guaranteed to yield the Hausdorff dimension if the IFS satisfies the Open Set Condition (OSC), which roughly means the images of the pieces do not have significant overlap.\n\nLet's calculate the similarity dimension for this system. The contraction ratios are the magnitudes of the coefficients of $x$:\n$c_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$c_2 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$c_3 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^D + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^D + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^D = 1 $$\n$$ 2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^D + \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2\\right)^D = 1 $$\nLet $y = (\\frac{1}{2})^D$. The equation becomes a quadratic in $y$:\n$$ 2y + y^2 = 1 $$\n$$ y^2 + 2y - 1 = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ y = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+4}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{2} $$\nSince $y = (\\frac{1}{2})^D$ must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$$ y = \\sqrt{2} - 1 $$\nNow we solve for $D$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^D = \\sqrt{2} - 1 $$\n$$ D \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\log(\\sqrt{2} - 1) $$\n$$ D = \\frac{\\log(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}{\\log(1/2)} = \\frac{\\log(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}{-\\log(2)} = -\\log_2(\\sqrt{2}-1) $$\nThis value is approximately $1.27155$. This matches option D.\n\nThe reason the similarity dimension formula gives the wrong answer is that the Open Set Condition is violated. As we saw in Step 1, $T_3([0, 1]) = [\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}]$ is entirely contained within $T_1([0, 1]) = [0, \\frac{1}{2}]$. This significant overlap invalidates the direct application of the formula for finding the Hausdorff dimension. The formula provides an upper bound, but not the actual value in this case. The actual attractor is the interval $[0, 1]$, whose dimension is 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct Hausdorff dimension is 1.\n\nFinal choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1715204"}, {"introduction": "Self-similarity is not limited to simple shrinking.

This final exercise invites you to explore the famous Barnsley's Fern, an object generated by an Iterated Function System, and predict how a small change in its underlying mathematical rules can dramatically alter its global shape [@problem_id:1715197]. This practice will build your intuition for how abstract mathematical parameters govern the emergence of intricate forms.", "problem": "A famous fractal known as Barnsley's Fern is the attractor of an Iterated Function System (IFS). The IFS consists of a set of four affine transformations, $w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4$, each applied with a certain probability, $p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4$. The fern is generated by the 'chaos game' algorithm: starting from a point $v_0$ (e.g., the origin), a sequence of points $v_{n+1}$ is generated by randomly choosing one of the transformations $w_i$ with its respective probability $p_i$ and applying it to the current point: $v_{n+1} = w_i(v_n)$.\n\nThe standard transformations, mapping a column vector $v = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$ to a new vector, are defined as $w_i(v) = A_i v + b_i$ with the following matrices $A_i$, translation vectors $b_i$, and probabilities $p_i$:\n\n$w_1$: $A_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.16 \\end{pmatrix}$, $b_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $p_1 = 0.01$\n\n$w_2$: $A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.85 & 0.04 \\\\ -0.04 & 0.85 \\end{pmatrix}$, $b_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1.60 \\end{pmatrix}$, $p_2 = 0.85$\n\n$w_3$: $A_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.20 & -0.26 \\\\ 0.23 & 0.22 \\end{pmatrix}$, $b_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1.60 \\end{pmatrix}$, $p_3 = 0.07$\n\n$w_4$: $A_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.15 & 0.28 \\\\ 0.26 & 0.24 \\end{pmatrix}$, $b_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0.44 \\end{pmatrix}$, $p_4 = 0.07$\n\nNow, consider a modified IFS where the transformation $w_2$ is replaced by $w_2'$ while all other transformations and probabilities remain unchanged.

The individual leaflets that branch off the main stem will now point downwards instead of upwards.\n\nE. The fern will be unrecognizable and will instead form a distorted, non-symmetrical cluster of points.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the role of each transformation in generating Barnsley's Fern and then analyze how modifying the most probable transformation, $w_2$, will alter the final structure.\n\nThe overall shape of the fern is the attractor of the Iterated Function System (IFS). This means the shape, let's call it $F$, has the property that it is the union of the transformed copies of itself: $F = w_1(F) \\cup w_2(F) \\cup w_3(F) \\cup w_4(F)$. The \"chaos game\" is an algorithm that converges to this attractor.\n\nLet's analyze the roles of the standard transformations:\n1.  **$w_1$ (Probability $p_1=0.01$):** The matrix $A_1$ has a determinant of 0 and collapses any point $(x,y)$ onto the y-axis, specifically to $(0, 0.16y)$. This transformation is responsible for creating the fern's stem. It is applied very infrequently.\n\n2.  **$w_2$ (Probability $p_2=0.85$):** This transformation is applied the vast majority of the time. It is a contractive mapping that takes the entire fern, shrinks it, rotates it slightly, and translates it upwards. This is the key to the fern's self-similarity, as it generates the main body of the fern by placing a smaller copy of the entire structure on top of the stem. The overall tilt and shape of the fern are dominated by this transformation.\n\n3.  **$w_3$ (Probability $p_3=0.07$):** This transformation maps the entire fern to the first leaflet on the left of the stem. It involves shrinking, rotation, and translation.\n\n4.  **$w_4$ (Probability $p_4=0.07$):** This transformation maps the entire fern to the first leaflet on the right of the stem, also involving shrinking, rotation, and translation.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the change from $w_2$ to $w_2'$. Let's analyze the geometric effect of the matrices $A_2$ and $A_2'$. An affine transformation of the form $v \\rightarrow Av+b$ can be understood as a combination of linear operations (scaling, rotation, shearing) from matrix $A$ followed by a translation from vector $b$. The modification only affects the matrix $A$, so we focus on its rotational effect.\n\nA 2D counter-clockwise rotation by an angle $\\theta$ is given by the matrix $R(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$. A clockwise rotation is $R(-\\theta)$. The matrices $A_2$ and $A_2'$ can be seen as scaled rotation matrices.\n\nLet's look at the original matrix, $A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.85 & 0.04 \\\\ -0.04 & 0.85 \\end{pmatrix}$. This resembles a scaled clockwise rotation matrix of the form $s \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\phi & \\sin\\phi \\\\ -\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi \\end{pmatrix}$, where $s$ is a scaling factor and $\\phi$ is the angle of rotation. The signs of the off-diagonal elements ($+0.04$ in the top right, $-0.04$ in the bottom left) indicate a clockwise rotation. This small clockwise rotation, applied repeatedly, causes the main body of the fern to tilt slightly to the right.\n\nNow consider the modified matrix, $A_2' = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.85 & -0.04 \\\\ 0.04 & 0.85 \\end{pmatrix}$. This matrix has the form of a scaled counter-clockwise rotation matrix, $s \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta \\end{pmatrix}$. Here, $s\\cos\\theta = 0.85$ and $s\\sin\\theta=0.04$. Since both are positive, $\\theta$ is a small positive angle, which corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation.\n\nSince the transformation $w_2$ (now $w_2'$) is chosen 85% of the time, its geometric properties dominate the global structure of the fractal. The original fern tilts to the right because $w_2$ applies a small clockwise rotation at each step of building the main frond. The modified transformation $w_2'$ applies a small counter-clockwise rotation. Therefore, the resulting fern will have its main body tilted to the left.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Incorrect. In a fractal system, even small changes to the generating rules, especially to the most probable rule, can have significant and visible effects on the global structure.\nB. Incorrect. The modification changes the direction of the tilt but does not eliminate it. The other transformations ($w_3, w_4$) are also not symmetric, so the entire structure will not become symmetric.\nC. Correct. The change from a clockwise rotation matrix ($A_2$) to a counter-clockwise rotation matrix ($A_2'$) in the dominant transformation reverses the direction of the fern's overall tilt from right to left.\nD. Incorrect. The orientation of individual leaflets is primarily determined by $w_3$ and $w_4$, which remain unchanged. $w_2$ controls the placement of the entire fern copy, not just the side leaflets.\nE. Incorrect. The modified system is still a well-defined IFS with contractive mappings. It will converge to a new, well-defined fractal attractor, not a random or unrecognizable mess. The structure will be distorted relative to the original, but it will still be a self-similar fern-like shape.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1715197"}]}
