The Kaplan-Yorke dimension, $D_{KY}$, provides an estimate for the fractal dimension of an attractor based on the system's Lyapunov exponents.\n\nFirst, we state the formula for the Kaplan-Yorke dimension. For a system with Lyapunov exponents ordered as $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_n$, the dimension is given by:\n$$D_{KY} = k + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_{k+1}|}$$\nHere, $k$ is the largest integer for which the sum of the first $k$ Lyapunov exponents is non-negative, i.e., $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\lambda_i \\ge 0$.\n\nNext, we extract the properties of the system from the problem statement.\n1.  The system is three-dimensional, so $n=3$. The Lyapunov exponents are $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3$, with the ordering $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3$.\n2.  The system is chaotic with one positive exponent, so $\\lambda_1 > 0$.\n3.  The flow is volume-preserving (due to the incompressibility of the fluid). For a continuous-time dynamical system, this implies that the sum of all Lyapunov exponents is zero.\n$$ \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3 = 0 $$\n\nNow, we must determine the integer $k$ for the Kaplan-Yorke formula. We check the partial sums of the ordered exponents.\n- For $j=1$: The sum is $\\lambda_1$. We are given that $\\lambda_1 > 0$, so this sum is positive.\n- For $j=2$: The sum is $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2$. From the volume-preserving condition, we can write $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = -\\lambda_3$. Since $\\lambda_1 > 0$ and the total sum is zero, at least one exponent must be negative. By the ordering convention, $\\lambda_3$ must be the most negative (or non-positive) exponent. Specifically, we must have $\\lambda_3 < 0$, because if $\\lambda_3 \\ge 0$, then with $\\lambda_1 > 0$ and $\\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 \\ge 0$, the sum $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3$ would be strictly positive, contradicting the volume-preserving condition. Since $\\lambda_3 < 0$, it follows that $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = -\\lambda_3 > 0$. So, this sum is also positive.\n- For $j=3$: The sum is $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\lambda_3$. From the volume-preserving condition, this sum is exactly 0.\n\nThe definition of $k$ is the largest integer such that the sum is non-negative.\n- The sum for $j=1$ is positive.\n- The sum for $j=2$ is positive.\n- The sum for $j=3$ is zero, which is non-negative.\nSo, the largest such integer is $k=3$.\n\nHowever, the Kaplan-Yorke formula requires a $(k+1)$-th exponent, which would be $\\lambda_4$ in this case, and it does not exist. This situation occurs when the sum of all exponents is non-negative ($\\sum_{i=1}^n \\lambda_i \\ge 0$). In this edge case, the attractor is not a fractal and fills the entire phase space. The dimension of the attractor is simply the dimension of the space, $n$. Therefore, $D_{KY} = 3$.\n\nAlternatively, we can arrive at the same result by applying the formula with $k=2$, as it is the largest integer for which the sum of exponents is strictly positive, and the next sum is not strictly negative.\nUsing $k=2$, the formula is:\n$$ D_{KY} = 2 + \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\lambda_i}{|\\lambda_3|} = 2 + \\frac{\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2}{|\\lambda_3|} $$\nWe previously established that $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = -\\lambda_3$ and that $\\lambda_3 < 0$. The absolute value of $\\lambda_3$ is therefore $|\\lambda_3| = -\\lambda_3$.\nSubstituting these into the formula:\n$$ D_{KY} = 2 + \\frac{-\\lambda_3}{-\\lambda_3} = 2 + 1 = 3 $$\nBoth lines of reasoning lead to the same conclusion. The Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the attractor is 3.
