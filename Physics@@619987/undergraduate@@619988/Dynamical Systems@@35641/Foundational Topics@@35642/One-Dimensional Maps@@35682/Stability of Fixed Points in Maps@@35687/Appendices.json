This exercise provides a foundational practice in this core skill.

The map has no fixed points.", "solution": "To find the fixed points of the map $x_{n+1} = \\sqrt{x_n+6}$, we must find the values of $x^*$ such that $x^* = f(x^*)$, where $f(x) = \\sqrt{x+6}$.\nSo we need to solve the equation:\n$$x = \\sqrt{x+6}$$\nFor this equation to hold, the value of $x$ on the left-hand side must be equal to the value of the square root on the right-hand side. Since the principal square root is non-negative, any valid fixed point $x^*$ must satisfy $x^* \\ge 0$.\n\nTo solve for $x$, we can square both sides of the equation:\n$$x^2 = (\\sqrt{x+6})^2$$\n$$x^2 = x+6$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic equation form gives:\n$$x^2 - x - 6 = 0$$\nWe can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We look for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add to -1. These numbers are -3 and 2.\n$$(x-3)(x+2) = 0$$\nThe potential solutions are $x=3$ and $x=-2$.\n\nNow we must check these potential solutions against the condition we identified earlier, namely that any fixed point must be non-negative ($x^* \\ge 0$).\nThe solution $x=3$ satisfies this condition.\nThe solution $x=-2$ does not satisfy this condition, as $-2 < 0$. If we were to substitute $x=-2$ back into the original fixed-point equation, we would get $-2 = \\sqrt{-2+6} = \\sqrt{4} = 2$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, $x=-2$ is a spurious solution introduced by the squaring step and is not a fixed point of the map.\nThus, the map has only one fixed point: $x^*=3$.\n\nNext, we classify the stability of this fixed point. The stability of a fixed point $x^*$ for a one-dimensional map $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ is determined by the magnitude of the derivative of the map function, $f'(x)$, evaluated at the fixed point, $x^*$.\nThe stability criterion is as follows:\n- If $|f'(x^*)| < 1$, the fixed point is stable (or attracting).\n- If $|f'(x^*)| > 1$, the fixed point is unstable (or repelling).\n- If $|f'(x^*)| = 1$, the stability is marginal and requires further analysis.\n\nThe map function is $f(x) = \\sqrt{x+6} = (x+6)^{1/2}$.\nWe compute the derivative of $f(x)$ using the chain rule:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x+6)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(x+6)^{-1/2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(x+6) = \\frac{1}{2}(x+6)^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x+6}}$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the fixed point $x^*=3$:\n$$f'(3) = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3+6}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{9}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nFinally, we check the magnitude of this value:\n$$|f'(3)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{6}\\right| = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nSince $|f'(3)| = \\frac{1}{6} < 1$, the fixed point $x^*=3$ is stable.\n\nCombining our findings, the map has a single fixed point at $x^*=3$, and this fixed point is stable.
