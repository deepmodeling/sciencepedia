We are given the definition of the map, the symbolic dynamics, a specific initial symbolic sequence, and a value for the third iterate.\n\nFirst, let's write down all the given conditions:\n1.  The tent map is defined as:\n    $$\n    T(x) = \\begin{cases}\n    2x & \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le 1/2 \\\\\n    2(1-x) & \\text{if } 1/2 < x \\le 1\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n2.

The first three symbols are given as $s_0 = \\text{'R'}$, $s_1 = \\text{'L'}$, and $s_2 = \\text{'R'}$.\n4.  The third iterate has a specific value: $x_3 = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nOur goal is to find $x_0$. We can use the information from the symbolic sequence to determine which branch of the tent map is applied at each step, allowing us to construct an expression for $x_3$ in terms of $x_0$.\n\nLet's translate the symbolic conditions into constraints on the iterates $x_0, x_1, x_2$ and determine the corresponding form of the map $T(x)$ for each iteration.\n\n-   **Step 0 to 1**: The first symbol is $s_0 = \\text{'R'}$. This implies that the initial condition $x_0$ is in the right half of the interval: $x_0 \\in (1/2, 1]$. For this range, the tent map is given by $T(x) = 2(1-x)$. Therefore, the first iterate is:\n    $$x_1 = T(x_0) = 2(1-x_0)$$\n\n-   **Step 1 to 2**: The second symbol is $s_1 = \\text{'L'}$. This implies that the first iterate $x_1$ is in the left half of the interval: $x_1 \\in [0, 1/2]$. For this range, the tent map is given by $T(x) = 2x$. Therefore, the second iterate is:\n    $$x_2 = T(x_1) = 2x_1$$\n\n-   **Step 2 to 3**: The third symbol is $s_2 = \\text{'R'}$. This implies that the second iterate $x_2$ is in the right half of the interval: $x_2 \\in (1/2, 1]$. For this range, the tent map is given by $T(x) = 2(1-x)$. Therefore, the third iterate is:\n    $$x_3 = T(x_2) = 2(1-x_2)$$\n\nNow we can combine these equations to express $x_3$ solely in terms of $x_0$. We'll use substitution.\nFirst, substitute the expression for $x_1$ into the equation for $x_2$:\n$$x_2 = 2x_1 = 2(2(1-x_0)) = 4(1-x_0)$$\nNext, substitute this expression for $x_2$ into the equation for $x_3$:\n$$x_3 = 2(1-x_2) = 2(1 - 4(1-x_0))$$\nLet's simplify this expression for $x_3$:\n$$x_3 = 2(1 - 4 + 4x_0) = 2(4x_0 - 3) = 8x_0 - 6$$\nSo, we have a direct relationship between $x_3$ and $x_0$: $x_3 = 8x_0 - 6$.\n\nThe problem states that $x_3 = \\frac{3}{4}$. We can now set our expression for $x_3$ equal to this value and solve for $x_0$:\n$$8x_0 - 6 = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nTo solve for $x_0$, we first add 6 to both sides:\n$$8x_0 = 6 + \\frac{3}{4}$$\nTo add the terms on the right, we find a common denominator:\n$$8x_0 = \\frac{24}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{27}{4}$$\nFinally, we divide by 8 to isolate $x_0$:\n$$x_0 = \\frac{27}{4 \\times 8} = \\frac{27}{32}$$\nThe determined initial condition is $x_0 = \\frac{27}{32}$.\n\nAs a final check, let's verify that this value of $x_0$ produces the correct symbolic sequence and the correct value for $x_3$.\n-   $x_0 = \\frac{27}{32} \\approx 0.84375$. Since $\\frac{27}{32} > \\frac{16}{32} = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $s_0 = \\text{'R'}$.

Since $\\frac{5}{16} \\le \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $s_1 = \\text{'L'}$. This is correct.\n-   $x_2 = 2x_1 = 2(\\frac{5}{16}) = \\frac{10}{16} = \\frac{5}{8}$. Since $\\frac{5}{8} > \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}$, we have $s_2 = \\text{'R'}$. This is correct.\n-   $x_3 = 2(1-x_2) = 2(1 - \\frac{5}{8}) = 2(\\frac{3}{8}) = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4}$.
