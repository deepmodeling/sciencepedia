This first practice provides a concrete entry point by considering a system with a finite number of states.

The evolution of the system is governed by the map $f: S \\to S$, where for any state $(x, y)$, the next state is given by:\n$$f(x, y) = ((x+y) \\pmod N, (x-y) \\pmod N)$$\nAll arithmetic in the components of the map is performed modulo $N$.\nAn orbit of an initial state $p_0$ is the sequence of states $p_0, p_1, p_2, \\dots$ where $p_{k+1} = f(p_k)$. The orbit is said to be periodic with period $T$ if $T$ is the smallest positive integer such that $p_T = p_0$.\n\nGiven $N=11$, determine the period of the orbit starting from the initial state $p_0 = (1, 0)$.", "solution": "We encode the map as a linear transformation modulo $11$.
