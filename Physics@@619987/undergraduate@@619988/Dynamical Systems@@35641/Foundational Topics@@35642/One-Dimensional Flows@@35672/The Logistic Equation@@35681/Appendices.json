The ecologist is interested in the conditions that lead to a stable, long-term population that does not go extinct.\n\nFor the system to be considered stable and non-trivial, the population fraction must eventually settle to a single, constant, non-zero value generation after generation. This means that for certain values of $r$, after a long time, the population fraction $x_n$ approaches a constant value $x^* > 0$.\n\nLet the exact range of values for the growth parameter $r$ that allows for such a stable, non-zero equilibrium be described by the open interval $(r_{\\text{min}}, r_{\\text{max}})$.
