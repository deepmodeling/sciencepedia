This exercise provides a clear, concrete example of how to determine where a system will eventually settle.

Determine the total number of stable fixed points that exist within the interval $x \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to find the fixed points of the system and then determine their stability.\n\nFirst, we identify the fixed points. Fixed points, denoted by $x^*$, are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change $\\dot{x}$ is zero. We set the given differential equation to zero:\n$$ \\dot{x} = \\sin(2x) - \\frac{1}{2} = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to finding the solutions to the equation:\n$$ \\sin(2x) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe general solutions for an angle $\\theta$ where $\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}$ are $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$ and $\\theta = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi$, where $k$ is any integer.\nIn our case, the angle is $2x$. So, we have:\n$$ 2x = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2x = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2k\\pi $$\nDividing by 2 gives the general solutions for the fixed points $x^*$:\n$$ x^* = \\frac{\\pi}{12} + k\\pi \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x^* = \\frac{5\\pi}{12} + k\\pi $$\nNow, we must find which of these fixed points lie within the specified interval $[0, 2\\pi]$. We test integer values for $k$:\n\nFor $k=0$:\n$x^* = \\frac{\\pi}{12}$. This is in $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n$x^* = \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$. This is in $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$x^* = \\frac{\\pi}{12} + \\pi = \\frac{13\\pi}{12}$. This is in $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n$x^* = \\frac{5\\pi}{12} + \\pi = \\frac{17\\pi}{12}$. This is in $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nFor $k=2$:\n$x^* = \\frac{\\pi}{12} + 2\\pi$. This is outside the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n$x^* = \\frac{5\\pi}{12} + 2\\pi$. This is outside the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\nFor negative $k$ values, the fixed points will be less than 0. Therefore, there are four fixed points in the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$: $\\frac{\\pi}{12}$, $\\frac{5\\pi}{12}$, $\\frac{13\\pi}{12}$, and $\\frac{17\\pi}{12}$.\n\nNext, we determine the stability of each fixed point. For a system $\\dot{x} = f(x)$, a fixed point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$. The condition $f'(x^*) < 0$ ensures that if the system is slightly perturbed from the fixed point, it will return towards it.\nThe function is $f(x) = \\sin(2x) - \\frac{1}{2}$. Its derivative is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\sin(2x) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2\\cos(2x) $$\nWe now evaluate the derivative at each of the four fixed points:\n\n1.  At $x^* = \\frac{\\pi}{12}$:\n    $f'\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{3}$.\n    Since $f'(\\frac{\\pi}{12}) = \\sqrt{3} > 0$, this fixed point is unstable.\n\n2.  At $x^* = \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$:\n    $f'\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right) = 2\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    Since $f'(\\frac{5\\pi}{12}) = -\\sqrt{3} < 0$, this fixed point is stable.\n\n3.  At $x^* = \\frac{13\\pi}{12}$:\n    $f'\\left(\\frac{13\\pi}{12}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{13\\pi}{12}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{13\\pi}{6}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6} + 2\\pi\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\sqrt{3}$.\n    Since $f'(\\frac{13\\pi}{12}) = \\sqrt{3} > 0$, this fixed point is unstable.\n\n4.  At $x^* = \\frac{17\\pi}{12}$:\n    $f'\\left(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{17\\pi}{12}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{17\\pi}{6}\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6} + 2\\pi\\right) = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}\\right) = -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    Since $f'(\\frac{17\\pi}{12}) = -\\sqrt{3} < 0$, this fixed point is stable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a graphical argument. The sign of $\\dot{x}$ determines the direction of flow. If $\\sin(2x) > 1/2$, then $\\dot{x} > 0$ and the flow is to the right. If $\\sin(2x) < 1/2$, then $\\dot{x} < 0$ and the flow is to the left. A fixed point is stable if the flow is directed towards it from both sides. This occurs where the graph of $y = \\sin(2x)$ intersects the line $y = 1/2$ from above (i.e., the slope of $\\sin(2x)$ is negative). An unstable point is where the intersection is from below (slope is positive). Our derivative calculation confirms this: the stable points correspond to where $\\cos(2x)$ is negative ($2x$ is in the second or third quadrant), and the unstable points correspond to where $\\cos(2x)$ is positive ($2x$ is in the first or fourth quadrant).\n\nCounting the stable fixed points, we have two: $x^* = \\frac{5\\pi}{12}$ and $x^* = \\frac{17\\pi}{12}$.\nThus, the total number of stable fixed points in the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$ is 2.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1680369"}, {"introduction": "Often in realistic models, finding exact algebraic solutions for fixed points is difficult or impossible.

By the intermediate value theorem and continuity, there is at least one root in $(-1,-\\tfrac{1}{2})$ and another at $x=0$. To establish uniqueness in $(-1,-\\tfrac{1}{2})$, compute\n$$\nh'(x) = \\pi \\cos(\\pi x) - \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\nFor $x \\in (-1,-\\tfrac{1}{2})$, we have $\\pi x \\in (-\\pi,-\\tfrac{\\pi}{2})$, so $\\cos(\\pi x) \\in (-1,0)$ and hence $h'(x) \\in (-\\pi-\\tfrac{1}{2},-\\tfrac{1}{2})$, which is strictly negative.
