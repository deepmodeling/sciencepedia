The Picard-Lindelöf theorem provides a set of sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a general IVP, $y'(t) = f(t, y)$ with $y(t_0) = y_0$, within some interval around $t_0$. The two main conditions are:\n1. The function $f(t, y)$ is continuous in a rectangular domain $D = \\{(t, y) : |t-t_0| \\le a, |y-y_0| \\le b \\}$.\n2. The function $f(t, y)$ satisfies a Lipschitz condition with respect to the variable $y$ in the domain $D$.

Multiplication by $2$ preserves continuity. Hence $f$ is continuous in any rectangle $D=\\{(t,y): |t|\\le a, |y|\\le b\\}$ containing $(0,0)$, and in particular at $(0,0)$. Therefore, condition 1 of the theorem holds.\n\nSecond, Lipschitz in $y$: suppose there exists a rectangle $D$ that includes the line $y=0$ (that is, $|y|\\le b$ with some $b>0$) and a constant $L>0$ such that for all $t$ and for all $y_{1},y_{2}$ with $|y_{i}|\\le b$,\n$$\n|f(t,y_{1})-f(t,y_{2})| \\le L|y_{1}-y_{2}|.\n$$\nFix $y_{1}=0$ and $y_{2}=\\varepsilon>0$ with $\\varepsilon \\le b$.
