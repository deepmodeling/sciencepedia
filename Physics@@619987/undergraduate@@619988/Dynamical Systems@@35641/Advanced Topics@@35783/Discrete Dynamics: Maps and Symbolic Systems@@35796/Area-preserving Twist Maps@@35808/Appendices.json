The system's state is described by a point $(x, y)$ in a cylindrical phase space, where $x \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ is an angular coordinate and $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a momentum-like coordinate. The state of the system at step $n+1$ is determined by its state at step $n$ through the following equations:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + K \\sin(x_n)$$\n$$x_{n+1} = (x_n + \\alpha y_{n+1}) \\pmod{2\\pi}$$\nHere, $K$ is a tunable real-valued parameter, and $\\alpha$ is a fixed constant with the value $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nThis system possesses fixed points, which are points $(x^*, y^*)$ that are mapped to themselves by the transformation. These fixed points can be classified into two distinct families based on their $x$-coordinate within the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. Let's designate these as Type A and Type B.\n- **Type A**: The family of fixed points where the coordinate $x^*=0$.\n- **Type B**: The family of fixed points where the coordinate $x^*=\\pi$.\n\nFor each family, there exists an open interval of non-zero $K$ values for which the fixed points are linearly stable (elliptic).

For the Type B fixed points, let this stability interval be $(c, d)$.\n\nDetermine the numerical values of the interval boundaries $a, b, c,$ and $d$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the general form of the fixed points and then analyze their linear stability by studying the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the map evaluated at these points.\n\n**Step 1: Finding the Fixed Points**\n\nA fixed point $(x^*, y^*)$ satisfies the conditions $x_{n+1} = x^*$ and $y_{n+1} = y^*$. We substitute $(x_n, y_n) = (x^*, y^*)$ into the map equations:\n$$y^* = y^* + K \\sin(x^*)$$\n$$x^* = (x^* + \\alpha y^*) \\pmod{2\\pi}$$\n\nFrom the first equation, assuming $K \\neq 0$, we must have:\n$$K \\sin(x^*) = 0 \\implies \\sin(x^*) = 0$$\nThis implies that $x^* = l\\pi$ for any integer $l$. This confirms the existence of the two families of fixed points in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$: one at $x^*=0$ (for $l=0, 2, 4, \\dots$) and another at $x^*=\\pi$ (for $l=1, 3, 5, \\dots$).\n\nFrom the second equation, we have:\n$$\\alpha y^* = 2m\\pi$$\nfor some integer $m$. This is because the position $x$ is an angle and only changes if a multiple of $2\\pi$ is added. Substituting $\\alpha = 1/3$:\n$$\\frac{1}{3} y^* = 2m\\pi \\implies y^* = 6m\\pi$$\nThus, the fixed points of the map are located at $(l\\pi, 6m\\pi)$ for any integers $l$ and $m$.\n\n**Step 2: Linear Stability Analysis**\n\nTo analyze the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the map. First, let's write the map as a single transformation $T(x_n, y_n) = (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$. To compute the partial derivatives, it's easier to substitute the expression for $y_{n+1}$ into the one for $x_{n+1}$:\n$$x_{n+1} = x_n + \\alpha(y_n + K \\sin(x_n)) = x_n + \\frac{1}{3}y_n + \\frac{K}{3}\\sin(x_n)$$\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + K \\sin(x_n)$$\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ is given by:\n$$J(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial x_{n+1}}{\\partial x_n}  \\frac{\\partial x_{n+1}}{\\partial y_n} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial y_{n+1}}{\\partial x_n}  \\frac{\\partial y_{n+1}}{\\partial y_n} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(x)  \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ K\\cos(x)  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe evaluate this matrix at the fixed points $(l\\pi, 6m\\pi)$.

For an area-preserving map, a fixed point is linearly stable (elliptic) if its eigenvalues are complex conjugates on the unit circle. This occurs when the trace $\\tau$ satisfies the condition $|\\tau|  2$.\n\nThe trace is:\n$$\\tau = \\text{Tr}(J(l\\pi)) = 1 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi) + 1 = 2 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi)$$\nThe stability condition is therefore:\n$$|2 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi)|  2$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to:\n$$-2  2 + \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi)  2$$\n$$-4  \\frac{K}{3}\\cos(l\\pi)  0$$\n\n**Step 4: Determine Stability Intervals for Each Family**\n\nWe now apply this condition to the two families of fixed points.\n\n**Type A (x* = 0):**\nThis corresponds to an even integer value for $l$ (e.g., $l=0$). For even $l$, $\\cos(l\\pi) = 1$. The stability condition becomes:\n$$-4  \\frac{K}{3}(1)  0 \\implies -4  \\frac{K}{3}  0$$\nMultiplying all parts of the inequality by 3, we get:\n$$-12  K  0$$\nSo, the stability interval for Type A fixed points is $(-12, 0)$. This gives us $a = -12$ and $b = 0$.\n\n**Type B (x* = $\\pi$):**\nThis corresponds to an odd integer value for $l$ (e.g., $l=1$). For odd $l$, $\\cos(l\\pi) = -1$. The stability condition becomes:\n$$-4  \\frac{K}{3}(-1)  0 \\implies -4  -\\frac{K}{3}  0$$\nMultiplying all parts of the inequality by $-3$ reverses the inequality signs:\n$$12  K  0$$\nSo, the stability interval for Type B fixed points is $(0, 12)$. This gives us $c = 0$ and $d = 12$.\n\nIn summary, we have found $a=-12$, $b=0$, $c=0$, and $d=12$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -12  0  0  12 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1661864"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the stillness of fixed points, phase space is often structured by intricate periodic orbits where the system cycles through a repeating sequence of states.
