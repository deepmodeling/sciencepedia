A bifurcation occurs when the stability of the fixed point changes, which corresponds to one or more eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix of the map crossing the unit circle in the complex plane.\n\nFirst, let's write the map as a vector function $f(x, y)$.\n$$\nf(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{n+1} \\\\ y_{n+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu x_n - y_n \\\\ x_n \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nA fixed point $(x^*, y^*)$ of the map satisfies $f(x^*, y^*) = (x^*, y^*)$. For the origin $(0,0)$, we can verify:\n$$\nf(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu(0) - 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the origin is a fixed point for any value of $\\mu$.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of this fixed point by linearizing the map around it. This involves computing the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the map $f$.\n$$\nJ(x, y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_x}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_x}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_y}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f_y}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWith $f_x = \\mu x - y$ and $f_y = x$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_x}{\\partial x} = \\mu, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f_x}{\\partial y} = -1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_y}{\\partial x} = 1, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f_y}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince the map is linear, the Jacobian matrix is constant and does not depend on the point $(x, y)$.\n\nThe stability of the fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the solutions to the characteristic equation $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\mu - \\lambda & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\mu - \\lambda)(-\\lambda) - (-1)(1) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\mu\\lambda + \\lambda^2 + 1 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - \\mu\\lambda + 1 = 0\n$$\nFor a discrete dynamical system, a fixed point is asymptotically stable if all eigenvalues have a magnitude less than 1 ($|\\lambda| < 1$). It is unstable if at least one eigenvalue has a magnitude greater than 1 ($|\\lambda| > 1$). A bifurcation occurs when the magnitude of at least one eigenvalue is exactly 1 ($|\\lambda| = 1$), marking the boundary between different stability regimes.\n\nLet's find the values of $\\mu$ for which $|\\lambda|=1$. The eigenvalues from the characteristic equation are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\mu \\pm \\sqrt{\\mu^2 - 4}}{2}\n$$\nWe analyze two cases based on the discriminant $\\Delta = \\mu^2 - 4$.\n\nCase 1: The eigenvalues are real. This occurs when $\\mu^2 - 4 \\ge 0$, which means $|\\mu| \\ge 2$.\nFor real eigenvalues, the condition $|\\lambda|=1$ means $\\lambda=1$ or $\\lambda=-1$.\nIf $\\lambda=1$, we substitute it into the characteristic equation:\n$1^2 - \\mu(1) + 1 = 0 \\implies 2 - \\mu = 0 \\implies \\mu = 2$.\nIf $\\lambda=-1$, we substitute it into the characteristic equation:\n$(-1)^2 - \\mu(-1) + 1 = 0 \\implies 1 + \\mu + 1 = 0 \\implies \\mu = -2$.\nThese values satisfy the condition $|\\mu| \\ge 2$. So, bifurcations occur at $\\mu=2$ and $\\mu=-2$.\n\nCase 2: The eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair. This occurs when $\\mu^2 - 4 < 0$, which means $|\\mu| < 2$ or $-2 < \\mu < 2$.\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\frac{\\mu}{2} \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{4-\\mu^2}}{2}$.\nThe magnitude squared of these eigenvalues is:\n$$\n|\\lambda|^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{4-\\mu^2}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\mu^2}{4} + \\frac{4-\\mu^2}{4} = \\frac{\\mu^2 + 4 - \\mu^2}{4} = 1\n$$\nThis means for all $\\mu$ in the open interval $(-2, 2)$, the eigenvalues lie on the unit circle, i.e., $|\\lambda| = 1$. In this range, the fixed point is a neutrally stable center. For a change in stability from stable to unstable, or a qualitative change in behavior (like from a center to a saddle), we look at the boundaries of this region.\n\nThe qualitative nature of the fixed point changes as $\\mu$ passes through the values where the eigenvalues transition from being complex (on the unit circle) to being real. This transition occurs precisely at $\\mu^2 - 4 = 0$, which gives $\\mu = 2$ and $\\mu = -2$.\n- For $|\\mu| > 2$, the eigenvalues are real, with $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = 1$. One eigenvalue will be greater than 1 in magnitude, so the fixed point is an unstable saddle.\n- For $|\\mu| < 2$, the eigenvalues are complex conjugates on the unit circle. The fixed point is a neutrally stable center.\n- At $|\\mu| = 2$, a bifurcation occurs where the behavior changes from a center to a saddle.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest positive value of $\\mu$ where this bifurcation happens.
