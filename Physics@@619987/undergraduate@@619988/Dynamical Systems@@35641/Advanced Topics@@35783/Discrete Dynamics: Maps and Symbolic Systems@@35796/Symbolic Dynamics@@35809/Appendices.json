The symbols are drawn from an alphabet $\\mathcal{A} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, which contains four distinct symbols. A state is a sequence $s = (s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots)$, where each entry $s_i$ is a symbol from the alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nThe system evolves according to a rule called the full shift map, $\\sigma$.

The dynamics are governed by the shift map $\\sigma(s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots) = (s_1 s_2 s_3 \\dots)$.\n\nWe are interested in periodic orbits of period 3. First, we find the number of points that are periodic of period 3. A point $s$ is said to be of prime period 3 if $\\sigma^3(s) = s$ and $\\sigma^1(s) \\neq s$. An orbit of period 3 consists of 3 such distinct points.\n\nLet's first identify all sequences $s$ that satisfy the condition $\\sigma^3(s) = s$. Applying the shift map three times gives $\\sigma^3(s_0 s_1 s_2 s_3 \\dots) = (s_3 s_4 s_5 \\dots)$.\nFor $\\sigma^3(s) = s$, we must have $(s_3 s_4 s_5 \\dots) = (s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots)$. This equality holds if and only if $s_i = s_{i+3}$ for all non-negative integers $i$. This means the sequence is entirely determined by its first three symbols, $(s_0 s_1 s_2)$, which form a repeating block. For example, if $(s_0, s_1, s_2) = (0, 1, 2)$, the sequence is $(0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, \\dots)$.\n\nThe total number of such repeating blocks of length 3 is the number of ways to choose the three symbols $s_0, s_1, s_2$ from the alphabet $\\mathcal{A}$. Since there are $k=4$ choices for each of the three positions, the total number of sequences satisfying $\\sigma^3(s) = s$ is $k^3 = 4^3$.\n$$ N_{\\text{period divides 3}} = 4^3 = 64 $$\nThese 64 sequences are the points whose period *divides* 3.

The only proper divisor of 3 is 1. A point with period 1 is a fixed point, satisfying $\\sigma(s) = s$.\nLet's find the number of fixed points. The condition $\\sigma(s) = s$ means $(s_1 s_2 s_3 \\dots) = (s_0 s_1 s_2 \\dots)$. This holds if and only if $s_i = s_{i+1}$ for all $i \\ge 0$, which implies $s_0 = s_1 = s_2 = \\dots$. The sequence must be constant. Since there are $k=4$ symbols in the alphabet, there are 4 such constant sequences: $(0,0,0,\\dots)$, $(1,1,1,\\dots)$, $(2,2,2,\\dots)$, and $(3,3,3,\\dots)$.\nThe number of fixed points (points of period 1) is therefore $k^1 = 4^1 = 4$.\n$$ N_{\\text{period is 1}} = 4^1 = 4 $$\nThese 4 points are included in the 64 points we counted earlier, because if $\\sigma^1(s) = s$, then it is also true that $\\sigma^3(s) = \\sigma^2(\\sigma(s)) = \\sigma^2(s) = \\sigma(\\sigma(s)) = \\sigma(s) = s$.\n\nThe number of points of prime period 3 is the total number of points whose period divides 3 minus the number of points whose period is 1.\n$$ N_{\\text{prime period 3}} = N_{\\text{period divides 3}} - N_{\\text{period is 1}} = k^3 - k^1 = 4^3 - 4^1 = 64 - 4 = 60 $$\nSo, there are 60 distinct sequences that have a prime period of 3.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct periodic *orbits* of period 3. By definition, an orbit of period 3 contains 3 distinct points. For example, the point $s = (0,1,2,0,1,2,\\dots)$ has prime period 3. Its orbit is the set:\n$$ \\{ (0,1,2,0,1,2,\\dots), \\sigma(s) = (1,2,0,1,2,0,\\dots), \\sigma^2(s) = (2,0,1,2,0,1,\\dots) \\} $$\nThese three points are distinct. Any point of prime period 3 will belong to an orbit with 3 distinct points. Therefore, to find the number of orbits, we must group the 60 points of prime period 3 into sets of 3.\n\nThe number of orbits of period 3 is the number of points of prime period 3 divided by the period length, 3.\n$$ \\text{Number of orbits of period 3} = \\frac{N_{\\text{prime period 3}}}{3} = \\frac{60}{3} = 20 $$\nThus, there are 20 distinct periodic orbits of period 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{20}$$", "id": "1712781"}, {"introduction": "To truly understand a dynamical system, we must classify its long-term, global behavior. This problem introduces two crucial properties, topological irreducibility and mixing, using the powerful tool of transition matrices. By learning to distinguish between a system where one can eventually visit any state (irreducible) and one where any transition becomes possible given enough time (mixing), you will gain insight into the structures underlying chaotic dynamics [@problem_id:1712798].", "problem": "In the study of symbolic dynamics, a subshift of finite type (SFT) provides a simplified model for a complex dynamical system.

These allowed transitions can be encoded in a $3 \\times 3$ transition matrix $T$, where the entry $T_{ij}$ (using 0-based indexing for rows $i$ and columns $j$) is 1 if a transition from symbol $i$ to symbol $j$ is permitted, and 0 otherwise.\n\nTwo important properties of such systems are topological irreducibility and topological mixing.\n\n- An SFT is **topologically irreducible** if its corresponding transition matrix $T$ is irreducible. A matrix $T$ is irreducible if for every pair of symbols $(i, j)$, there exists some positive integer $n$ such that the $(i, j)$-th entry of the matrix power $T^n$, denoted $(T^n)_{ij}$, is greater than zero. This corresponds to the ability to eventually transition from any state to any other state.\n\n- An SFT is **topologically mixing** if its corresponding transition matrix $T$ is primitive. A non-negative matrix $T$ is primitive if there exists a single positive integer $k$ such that all entries of the matrix power $T^k$ are strictly positive. This is a stronger condition than irreducibility and implies that after a sufficiently long time $k$, a transition is possible between any two states in exactly $k$ steps.\n\nConsider the five transition matrices below.

For an irreducible nonnegative matrix, primitivity is equivalent to aperiodicity, where the period of a state is the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all closed walks through that state; if the period is greater than $1$, the matrix is imprimitive and hence not primitive.\n\nWe examine each matrix.\n\nMatrix $T_{A}$:\n$$\nT_{A}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis is the permutation matrix of a single $3$-cycle $0 \\to 1 \\to 2 \\to 0$.

Hence $T_{A}$ is irreducible. However, all closed walks have length a multiple of $3$, so the period is $3$. Therefore $T_{A}$ is imprimitive (not primitive). Equivalently, for every $k$, $T_{A}^{k}$ has zeros in some entries (indeed $T_{A}^{3m} = I_{3}$), so there is no $k$ with all entries strictly positive.
