This first practice explores a reflection map, which has very clear and predictable behavior. By analyzing this map, you will distinguish between points that remain stationary (fixed points) and those that return to their original position after exactly two steps, forming a period-2 orbit [@problem_id:1697641].", "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional discrete dynamical system used to model a simplified reflection process. The state of a particle at step $n+1$, denoted by the coordinate vector $(x_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$, is determined from its state at step $n$, denoted by $(x_n, y_n)$, by the map $F: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$. The map is defined as:\n$$ F(x, y) = (x, -y) $$\nA point $(x_0, y_0)$ is called a fixed point if it remains unchanged after one application of the map, i.e., $F(x_0, y_0) = (x_0, y_0)$. A point is said to have a periodic orbit of period $k$, where $k$ is a positive integer, if it returns to its initial state after exactly $k$ applications of the map.

A fixed point $(x_{0},y_{0})$ satisfies $F(x_{0},y_{0}) = (x_{0},y_{0})$. Substituting the definition of $F$, this condition is\n$$\n(x_{0},-y_{0}) = (x_{0},y_{0}).\n$$\nEquality of ordered pairs implies $x_{0} = x_{0}$ (always true) and $-y_{0} = y_{0}$, which gives $y_{0} = 0$. Therefore, the set of fixed points is exactly all points with $y=0$, i.e., the entire $x$-axis.\n\nNext, consider periodicity of other points. Compute the second iterate:\n$$\nF^{2}(x,y) = F(F(x,y)) = F(x,-y) = (x,y).\n$$\nThus every point satisfies $F^{2}(x,y) = (x,y)$, so every point has period dividing $2$. For points with $y \\ne 0$, we have $F(x,y) = (x,-y) \\ne (x,y)$, so they are not fixed points. Therefore, for all $(x,y)$ with $y \\ne 0$, the minimal period is exactly $2$.\n\nThis behavior matches the statement that the map has a line of fixed points on the $x$-axis, and all other points have period-$2$ orbits.
