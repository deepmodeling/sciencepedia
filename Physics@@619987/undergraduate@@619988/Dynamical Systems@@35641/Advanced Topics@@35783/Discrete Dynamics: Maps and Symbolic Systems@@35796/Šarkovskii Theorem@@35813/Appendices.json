The theorem implies a specific ordering of the natural numbers, known as the Šarkovskii ordering. If we write $p \\succ q$, it means that any continuous function that has a periodic point of period $p$ must also have a periodic point of period $q$. The ordering is defined as follows:\n\nFirst, all odd numbers greater than 1 are ordered by magnitude:\n$3 \\succ 5 \\succ 7 \\succ 9 \\succ \\dots$\n\nNext, these are followed by the same odd numbers multiplied by 2, then by 4, then by 8, and so on:\n$\\dots \\succ 2 \\cdot 3 \\succ 2 \\cdot 5 \\succ 2 \\cdot 7 \\succ \\dots \\succ 4 \\cdot 3 \\succ 4 \\cdot 5 \\succ 4 \\cdot 7 \\succ \\dots \\succ 2^k \\cdot 3 \\succ 2^k \\cdot 5 \\succ \\dots$\n\nFinally, the ordering is completed by the powers of 2 in decreasing order:\n$\\dots \\succ 2^3 \\succ 2^2 \\succ 2^1 \\succ 1$\n\nMore formally, to compare two numbers $p$ and $q$, we write them in the form $p = m_p \\cdot 2^{k_p}$ and $q = m_q \\cdot 2^{k_q}$, where $m_p$ and $m_q$ are odd integers. Then $p \\succ q$ if either of the following conditions is met:\n1. $k_p < k_q$.\n2. $k_p = k_q$ and $m_p < m_q$ (assuming $m_p, m_q > 1$).\nIf $m_p=1$ or $m_q=1$ (i.e., the numbers are powers of 2), the ordering is simply decreasing: $2^{k_p} \\succ 2^{k_q}$ if $k_p > k_q$.\n\nUsing this definition, arrange the numbers 6, 9, 10, and 12 according to the Šarkovskii ordering, from strongest ($\\succ$) to weakest.

The theorem implies that if a period $p$ is present, then all periods that follow $p$ in the Šarkovskii ordering must also be present, forming a \"tail\". This practice challenges you to use this property to test for \"admissibility\" – determining if a hypothetical set of periods could ever be generated by a continuous one-dimensional system [@problem_id:1705212].", "problem": "Consider a dynamical system described by a continuous map $f: I \\to I$, where $I$ is a compact interval on the real line.

The set of all such minimal periods $k$ for a given map $f$ is denoted by $\\text{Per}(f)$.\n\nThe possible structures of the set $\\text{Per}(f)$ are constrained by a result known as Šarkovskii's theorem.

This suggests a function that violates the conditions of Šarkovskii's theorem, which would guarantee a period-3 point if a period-5 point exists for a continuous function. The key is to use the discontinuity to break the topological structure that forces the existence of other periods.\n\nA simple way to create orbits of a specific period is to model a rotation on a circle. A map $g(\\theta) = (\\theta + \\alpha) \\pmod{2\\pi}$ on the circle $[0, 2\\pi)$ can have periodic points. If we identify the interval $[0,1]$ with a circle, we can construct a similar map. Let's consider a map of the form $f(x) = (x + c) \\pmod 1$ for some constant $c$. Such a map has periodic orbits of period $k$ if $k c$ is an integer.\n\nWe want a period-5 point, so we want $5c$ to be an integer. We do not want a period-3 point, so we want $3c$ to *not* be an integer. A simple choice for $c$ that satisfies this is $c = \\frac{2}{5}$. With this choice, $5c = 2$ (an integer), while $3c = \\frac{6}{5}$ (not an integer).\n\nLet's build a function on $[0,1]$ that embodies this idea of \"adding $\\frac{2}{5}$ and taking the result modulo 1\".\nThis can be written as:\n- If $x + \\frac{2}{5}  1$, then $f(x) = x + \\frac{2}{5}$. This holds for $x  1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n- If $x + \\frac{2}{5} \\ge 1$, then we subtract 1, so $f(x) = x + \\frac{2}{5} - 1 = x - \\frac{3}{5}$. This holds for $x \\ge \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThis leads us to propose the following piecewise function:\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx + \\frac{2}{5}  \\text{if } 0 \\le x  \\frac{3}{5} \\\\\nx - \\frac{3}{5}  \\text{if } \\frac{3}{5} \\le x \\le 1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe codomain of $f(x)$ is $[0,1]$. For the first piece, if $0 \\le x  \\frac{3}{5}$, then $\\frac{2}{5} \\le x + \\frac{2}{5}  1$. For the second piece, if $\\frac{3}{5} \\le x \\le 1$, then $0 \\le x - \\frac{3}{5} \\le \\frac{2}{5}$. So the function indeed maps $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$.\n\nNow we verify the three given conditions for this function.\n\n**Condition 3: Exactly one point of discontinuity.**\nThe function is defined by two linear expressions. On the open interval $(0, 3/5)$, $f(x)=x+2/5$ is continuous. On the open interval $(3/5, 1)$, $f(x)=x-3/5$ is continuous. The only potential point of discontinuity is at their junction, $x = 3/5$.\nLet's check the left-hand limit and the value of the function at this point.\nThe left-hand limit is:\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to (3/5)^{-}} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to (3/5)^{-}} \\left(x + \\frac{2}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = 1 $$\nThe function value at $x=3/5$ is given by the second piece:\n$$ f\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{3}{5} = 0 $$\nSince $\\lim_{x \\to (3/5)^{-}} f(x) \\neq f(3/5)$, the function is discontinuous at $x = 3/5$. This is the only point of discontinuity. Thus, condition 3 is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 1: Existence of a prime period-5 point.**\nLet's iterate the function starting from $x_0 = 0$ to check for a period-5 orbit.\n$x_0 = 0$\n$x_1 = f(x_0) = f(0) = 0 + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{5}$ (since $0  3/5$)\n$x_2 = f(x_1) = f(\\frac{2}{5}) = \\frac{2}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$ (since $2/5  3/5$)\n$x_3 = f(x_2) = f(\\frac{4}{5}) = \\frac{4}{5} - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$ (since $4/5 > 3/5$)\n$x_4 = f(x_3) = f(\\frac{1}{5}) = \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5}$ (since $1/5  3/5$)\n$x_5 = f(x_4) = f(\\frac{3}{5}) = \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{3}{5} = 0 = x_0$.\nThe orbit is $\\{0, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{4}{5}, \\frac{1}{5}, \\frac{3}{5}\\}$. These are five distinct points, so $f^5(0) = 0$. Since none of the intermediate iterates $f^k(0)$ for $k=1, 2, 3, 4$ are equal to 0, the point $x_0=0$ has a prime period of 5. Thus, condition 1 is satisfied.\n\n**Condition 2: No points of period 3.**\nWe need to show that there is no $x$ such that $f^3(x)=x$.\nLet $x_i = f^i(x)$. We can express the action of $f$ as $x_{i+1} = (x_i + 2/5) \\pmod 1$. A more formal way is to write:\n$$ x_{i+1} = x_i + \\frac{2}{5} - n_i $$\nwhere $n_i=0$ if $x_i \\in [0, 3/5)$ and $n_i=1$ if $x_i \\in [3/5, 1]$.\nLet's compute $x_3$ in terms of $x_0=x$:\n$$ x_1 = x_0 + \\frac{2}{5} - n_0 $$\n$$ x_2 = x_1 + \\frac{2}{5} - n_1 = \\left(x_0 + \\frac{2}{5} - n_0\\right) + \\frac{2}{5} - n_1 = x_0 + \\frac{4}{5} - n_0 - n_1 $$\n$$ x_3 = x_2 + \\frac{2}{5} - n_2 = \\left(x_0 + \\frac{4}{5} - n_0 - n_1\\right) + \\frac{2}{5} - n_2 = x_0 + \\frac{6}{5} - (n_0 + n_1 + n_2) $$\nIf $f^3(x)=x$, meaning $x_3=x_0$, we must have:\n$$ x_0 = x_0 + \\frac{6}{5} - (n_0 + n_1 + n_2) $$\n$$ \\implies n_0 + n_1 + n_2 = \\frac{6}{5} $$\nHowever, each $n_i$ must be an integer (either 0 or 1). Therefore, their sum $N = n_0 + n_1 + n_2$ must be an integer ($N \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$). Since $\\frac{6}{5}$ is not an integer, there is no sequence of iterations that can satisfy this condition.\nTherefore, there is no $x \\in [0,1]$ such that $f^3(x)=x$. This means there are no points of prime period 3, and also no points of period 1 (fixed points). Thus, condition 2 is satisfied.\n\nOur proposed function satisfies all three conditions.
