A period-two orbit, where the system alternates between two distinct states, is the next level of dynamic complexity.

The solutions to this equation include both fixed points (where $f(x) = x$) and points of prime period two (where $f(x) \\neq x$). We must first identify the fixed points and then exclude them from our final set of solutions.\n\nFirst, let's find the fixed points by solving $f(x) = x$. We consider the two cases based on the piecewise definition of $f(x)$.\n\nCase A: $0 \\le x \\le \\frac{1}{3}$. The equation is $3x = x$, which simplifies to $2x = 0$, giving $x = 0$. Since $0$ is in the interval $[0, 1/3]$, it is a valid fixed point.\n\nCase B: $\\frac{1}{3} < x \\le 1$. The equation is $\\frac{3}{2}(1-x) = x$. Multiplying by 2 gives $3(1-x) = 2x$, which expands to $3 - 3x = 2x$. Rearranging, we get $5x = 3$, so $x = \\frac{3}{5}$. Since $\\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{15}$ and $\\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{9}{15}$, we have $\\frac{1}{3} < \\frac{3}{5} \\le 1$. Thus, $x = \\frac{3}{5}$ is also a valid fixed point.\n\nThe fixed points of the map $f$ are $x=0$ and $x=3/5$. These points are not of prime period two.\n\nNow, we solve $f(f(x)) = x$ to find all period-two points. Let $y = f(x)$, so the equation becomes $f(y) = x$. We have four possible combinations for the composition $f(f(x))$ depending on whether $x$ and $y=f(x)$ are above or below the breakpoint $1/3$.\n\nCase 1: $x \\in [0, \\frac{1}{3}]$ and $y=f(x) \\in [0, \\frac{1}{3}]$.\nHere, $y = 3x$. The condition $y \\le 1/3$ implies $3x \\le 1/3$, so $x \\le 1/9$. This case is valid for $x \\in [0, 1/9]$.\nThe equation $f(y) = x$ becomes $3y = x$. Substituting $y=3x$, we get $3(3x) = x$, or $9x = x$, which means $8x=0$, so $x=0$. This is the fixed point we already found.\n\nCase 2: $x \\in (\\frac{1}{3}, 1]$ and $y=f(x) \\in (\\frac{1}{3}, 1]$.\nHere, $y = \\frac{3}{2}(1-x)$. The condition $y > 1/3$ implies $\\frac{3}{2}(1-x) > 1/3$, so $1-x > 2/9$, which means $x < 7/9$. This case is valid for $x \\in (1/3, 7/9)$.\nThe equation $f(y)=x$ becomes $\\frac{3}{2}(1-y) = x$. Substituting the expression for $y$, we get $\\frac{3}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{2}(1-x)\\right) = x$.\n$\\frac{3}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}x\\right) = x$\n$\\frac{3}{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}x\\right) = x$\n$-\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{9}{4}x = x$\n$\\frac{5}{4}x = \\frac{3}{4}$, which gives $x = \\frac{3}{5}$. This is the other fixed point.\n\nCase 3: $x \\in [0, \\frac{1}{3}]$ and $y=f(x) \\in (\\frac{1}{3}, 1]$.\nHere, $y = 3x$. The condition $y > 1/3$ implies $3x > 1/3$, so $x > 1/9$. This case is valid for $x \\in (1/9, 1/3]$.\nThe equation $f(y)=x$ becomes $\\frac{3}{2}(1-y) = x$. Substituting $y=3x$, we get $\\frac{3}{2}(1 - 3x) = x$.\n$3(1-3x) = 2x$, so $3 - 9x = 2x$. This gives $11x=3$, so $x = \\frac{3}{11}$.\nWe check if this value of $x$ is in the valid range $(1/9, 1/3]$. Since $1/9 = 11/99$ and $3/11 = 27/99$ and $1/3=33/99$, we have $1/9 < 3/11 \\le 1/3$. The condition is satisfied. Since $3/11$ is not a fixed point, it must be a point of prime period two. Let's find its partner: $f(3/11) = 3 \\times \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{9}{11}$. The partner's value $9/11$ is in the range $(1/3, 1]$, as required for this case.\n\nCase 4: $x \\in (\\frac{1}{3}, 1]$ and $y=f(x) \\in [0, \\frac{1}{3}]$.\nHere, $y = \\frac{3}{2}(1-x)$. The condition $y \\le 1/3$ implies $\\frac{3}{2}(1-x) \\le 1/3$, so $1-x \\le 2/9$, which means $x \\ge 7/9$. This case is valid for $x \\in [7/9, 1]$.\nThe equation $f(y)=x$ becomes $3y=x$. Substituting the expression for $y$: $3\\left(\\frac{3}{2}(1-x)\\right) = x$.\n$\\frac{9}{2}(1-x) = x$, so $9(1-x) = 2x$, which gives $9-9x=2x$. This simplifies to $11x=9$, so $x = \\frac{9}{11}$.\nWe check if this $x$ is in the valid range $[7/9, 1]$. Since $7/9 = 77/99$ and $9/11 = 81/99$, we have $7/9 \\le 9/11 \\le 1$. The condition is satisfied. This is the partner point we found in Case 3.\nWe can verify: $f(9/11) = \\frac{3}{2}(1-9/11) = \\frac{3}{2}(2/11) = \\frac{3}{11}$.\nSo, the points $3/11$ and $9/11$ form a 2-cycle, as $f(3/11) = 9/11$ and $f(9/11) = 3/11$. They are distinct from each other and are not fixed points.\n\nThe points of prime period two are $3/11$ and $9/11$. In increasing order, they are $3/11$ and $9/11$.
