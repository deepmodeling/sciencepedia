In this exercise, we analyze an affine map, a type of model frequently used for systems with constant external influences, such as a steady influx of a species. The core principle you'll apply here is that the stability of a fixed point in a linear or affine system is entirely determined by the eigenvalues of the system's governing matrix [@problem_id:1708641].

Let $x_n$ and $y_n$ represent the populations (in thousands of individuals) of species A and B, respectively, at the beginning of year $n$.

An equilibrium state is defined by the condition that the population does not change from one year to the next, so $\\mathbf{p}_{n+1} = \\mathbf{p}_n = \\mathbf{p}^*$. Substituting this into the given evolution equation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}^* = M \\mathbf{p}^* + \\mathbf{c}\n$$\nWe need to solve this equation for $\\mathbf{p}^*$. Rearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}^* - M \\mathbf{p}^* = \\mathbf{c}\n$$\n$$\n(I - M) \\mathbf{p}^* = \\mathbf{c}\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. To find $\\mathbf{p}^*$, we can multiply by the inverse of $(I - M)$, provided it exists.\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}^* = (I - M)^{-1} \\mathbf{c}\n$$\nLet's first compute the matrix $(I - M)$:\n$$\nI - M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1  0.2 \\\\ 0.2  0.1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 - 0.1  0 - 0.2 \\\\ 0 - 0.2  1 - 0.1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.9  -0.2 \\\\ -0.2  0.9 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we find the inverse of $(I - M)$. The inverse of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{pmatrix} d  -b \\\\ -c  a \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant of $(I - M)$ is:\n$$\n\\det(I - M) = (0.9)(0.9) - (-0.2)(-0.2) = 0.81 - 0.04 = 0.77\n$$\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the inverse exists.\n$$\n(I - M)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{0.77} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.9  0.2 \\\\ 0.2  0.9 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we can calculate the equilibrium vector $\\mathbf{p}^*$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}^* = \\frac{1}{0.77} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.9  0.2 \\\\ 0.2  0.9 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 7 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{0.77} \\begin{pmatrix} (0.9)(7) + (0.2)(7) \\\\ (0.2)(7) + (0.9)(7) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}^* = \\frac{1}{0.77} \\begin{pmatrix} 6.3 + 1.4 \\\\ 1.4 + 6.3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{0.77} \\begin{pmatrix} 7.7 \\\\ 7.7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{7.7}{0.77} \\\\ \\frac{7.7}{0.77} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, the equilibrium population vector is $\\mathbf{p}^* = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$. This means the equilibrium populations are 10,000 for each species. This narrows down the options to A and B.\n\nNext, we must determine the stability of this equilibrium. For a linear or affine map of the form $\\mathbf{p}_{n+1} = M \\mathbf{p}_n + \\mathbf{c}$, the stability of the fixed point is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$. The fixed point is asymptotically stable if and only if all eigenvalues of $M$ have a magnitude (absolute value) strictly less than 1.\n\nWe find the eigenvalues of $M = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1  0.2 \\\\ 0.2  0.1 \\end{pmatrix}$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(M - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1 - \\lambda  0.2 \\\\ 0.2  0.1 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(0.1 - \\lambda)(0.1 - \\lambda) - (0.2)(0.2) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(0.1 - \\lambda)^2 - 0.04 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(0.1 - \\lambda)^2 = 0.04\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n$$\n0.1 - \\lambda = \\pm \\sqrt{0.04} = \\pm 0.2\n$$\nThis gives us two eigenvalues:\n1.  $0.1 - \\lambda_1 = 0.2 \\implies \\lambda_1 = 0.1 - 0.2 = -0.1$\n2.  $0.1 - \\lambda_2 = -0.2 \\implies \\lambda_2 = 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3$\n\nThe eigenvalues of $M$ are $\\lambda_1 = -0.1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0.3$.\n\nNow we check their magnitudes:\n$$\n|\\lambda_1| = |-0.1| = 0.1\n$$\n$$\n|\\lambda_2| = |0.3| = 0.3\n$$\nSince both $|\\lambda_1|  1$ and $|\\lambda_2|  1$, the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable. This means that if the populations are slightly perturbed from the equilibrium of $(10, 10)$, they will return to this equilibrium over time.\n\nCombining our findings, the equilibrium state is $\\mathbf{p}^* = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 10 \\end{pmatrix}$ and it is stable.
