This exercise [@problem_id:1721317] will solidify your understanding of how the map's piecewise formula transforms a point's coordinates, providing a concrete example of the underlying stretching action governed by a parameter $\\mu$ and compressing action by a parameter $\\lambda$.", "problem": "Consider a simplified two-dimensional model for the chaotic mixing of a substance within a square region defined by $S = \\{(x,y) \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1, 0 \\le y \\le 1\\}$. The state of any particle in this region is described by its coordinates $(x,y)$. The evolution of a particle's position after one time step is given by a transformation $T: D \\to S$, where the domain $D$ is a subset of $S$.\n\nThe transformation $T$ is constructed as follows. First, the square $S$ is stretched horizontally by a factor of $\\mu$ and compressed vertically by a factor of $\\lambda$. The resulting wide, short rectangle is then folded back over itself and laid back over the original square $S$. The domain $D$ of the transformation consists of all points in $S$ whose images under this process land back inside $S$. This domain is composed of two disjoint vertical strips.\n\nA point $(x,y)$ is in the domain $D$ if its x-coordinate satisfies either $0 \\le x \\le 1/\\mu$ or $1 - 1/\\mu \\le x \\le 1$.

The parameters for the transformation are given as the stretching factor $\\mu=4$ and the compression factor $\\lambda=1/4$.\n\nFirst, we must determine which of the two defined regions the initial point $P=(x,y)=(0.1, 0.2)$ belongs to. The transformation has two different forms corresponding to the two vertical strips that form its domain $D$. These strips are defined by the intervals for the x-coordinate.\n\nLet's calculate the boundaries of these intervals using the given parameter $\\mu=4$:\nThe interval for the first strip is:\n$$ \\left[0, \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\right] = \\left[0, \\frac{1}{4}\\right] = [0, 0.25] $$\nThe interval for the second strip is:\n$$ \\left[1 - \\frac{1}{\\mu}, 1\\right] = \\left[1 - \\frac{1}{4}, 1\\right] = \\left[\\frac{3}{4}, 1\\right] = [0.75, 1] $$\n\nNow, we check the x-coordinate of the initial point $P$. The x-coordinate is $x=0.1$. We need to determine if this value lies in the interval $[0, 0.25]$ or $[0.75, 1]$.\nSince $0 \\le 0.1 \\le 0.25$, the point $P$ is located in the first strip.\n\nTherefore, we must use the first case of the piecewise definition for the transformation $T(x,y)$:\n$$ T(x,y) = (x', y') = (\\mu x, \\lambda y) $$\nWe substitute the given values for the parameters $\\mu$, $\\lambda$, and the coordinates of the point $P(x,y)$:\n$x = 0.1$\n$y = 0.2$\n$\\mu = 4$\n$\\lambda = 1/4$\n\nNow we can compute the new coordinates $(x', y')$:\nThe new x-coordinate is:\n$$ x' = \\mu x = 4 \\times 0.1 = 0.4 $$\nThe new y-coordinate is:\n$$ y' = \\lambda y = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.2 = \\frac{0.2}{4} = 0.05 $$\n\nThus, the coordinates of the particle after one time step are $(0.4, 0.05)$.
