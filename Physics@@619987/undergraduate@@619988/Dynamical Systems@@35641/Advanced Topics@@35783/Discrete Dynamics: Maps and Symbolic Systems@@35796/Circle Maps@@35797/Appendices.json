Its position at time step $n$ is denoted by $x_n$, where $x_n \\in [0, 1)$. The evolution of the particle's position is described by the discrete-time dynamical system known as a rigid rotation circle map:\n$$x_{n+1} = (x_n + \\Omega) \\pmod{1}$$\nwhere the operation $\\pmod{1}$ denotes taking the fractional part of a number (e.g., $3.7 \\pmod{1} = 0.7$).

The orbit is said to be periodic with period $p$ if $p$ is the smallest positive integer such that $x_p = x_0$. Determine the period of any orbit for this system.", "solution": "Let the circle map be defined as $x_{n+1} = f(x_n) = (x_n + \\Omega) \\pmod{1}$, with $\\Omega = 4/11$. We want to find the period $p$ of an orbit starting at an initial point $x_0$. The period $p$ is the smallest positive integer such that $x_p = x_0$.\n\nFirst, let's find a general expression for $x_n$ in terms of $x_0$ and $n$. We can iterate the map:\nFor $n=1$:\n$x_1 = (x_0 + \\Omega) \\pmod{1}$\n\nFor $n=2$:\n$x_2 = (x_1 + \\Omega) \\pmod{1} = ((x_0 + \\Omega) \\pmod{1} + \\Omega) \\pmod{1}$\nDue to the property of the modulo operator, $(a \\pmod{1} + b) \\pmod{1} = (a + b) \\pmod{1}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$x_2 = (x_0 + 2\\Omega) \\pmod{1}$\n\nBy induction, we can establish the general formula for the $n$-th state of the system:\n$$x_n = (x_0 + n\\Omega) \\pmod{1}$$\n\nNow, we apply the condition for periodicity, which is $x_p = x_0$ for the smallest positive integer $p$.\nSubstituting our general formula into the periodicity condition, we get:\n$$(x_0 + p\\Omega) \\pmod{1} = x_0$$\nSince $x_0 \\in [0, 1)$, we can also write $x_0 = x_0 \\pmod{1}$. The equation becomes:\n$$(x_0 + p\\Omega) \\pmod{1} = x_0 \\pmod{1}$$\nThis equality holds if and only if the difference between $(x_0 + p\\Omega)$ and $x_0$ is an integer. Let this integer be $k$.\n$$(x_0 + p\\Omega) - x_0 = k$$\n$$p\\Omega = k$$\nwhere $k$ is some integer. Since we are looking for the smallest positive integer $p$, $p\\Omega$ must be a positive quantity, so $k$ must be a positive integer.\n\nWe are given that the rotation number is $\\Omega = 4/11$. Substituting this value into our equation:\n$$p \\left(\\frac{4}{11}\\right) = k$$\n$$4p = 11k$$\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer $p$ that satisfies this equation for some positive integer $k$. This is a linear Diophantine equation. The equation shows that $4p$ must be a multiple of 11. Since 4 and 11 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), it must be that $p$ is a multiple of 11. We can write $p = 11m$ for some positive integer $m$.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer $p$, we must choose the smallest positive integer value for $m$, which is $m=1$.\nThis gives:\n$$p = 11 \\cdot 1 = 11$$\n\nIf $p=11$, then $k = \\frac{4 \\cdot 11}{11} = 4$. Since $k=4$ is an integer, $p=11$ is a valid solution. As we found this from the smallest possible value of $m$, $p=11$ is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition.\nThus, the period of any orbit is 11. This means that after 11 steps, the point has been rotated by a total of $p\\Omega = 11 \\times (4/11) = 4$ full circles, returning it to its exact starting position $x_0$. For any positive integer smaller than 11, the product $p \\cdot (4/11)$ would not be an integer, so the point would not have returned to its starting position.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "1666931"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple rotation, we now consider the standard circle map, which includes a non-linear term to model the interaction between an oscillator and an external force.
