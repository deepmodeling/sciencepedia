The distribution $P_{st}(x)$ is bimodal, indicating the particle has two preferential locations (stable states).\n2.  The two local maxima of $P_{st}(x)$ occur at positions $x = -x_0$ and $x = +x_0$, for some positive constant $x_0$.\n3.

Since the exponential is a strictly decreasing function of $U$, the local maxima of $P_{st}(x)$ occur at the local minima of $U(x)$, and higher peaks of $P_{st}$ correspond to deeper minima (lower values) of $U$.\n\nThe observations require:\n- Bimodality of $P_{st}$: $U(x)$ must have two minima (a double-well structure).\n- Maxima at $x=\\pm x_{0}$: the two wells must be centered near $\\pm x_{0}$.\n- Taller peak at $x=+x_{0}$ than at $x=-x_{0}$: $U(+x_{0})<U(-x_{0})$.\n\nNow test each option:\n\nA. $U(x)=A(x^{2}-x_{0}^{2})^{2}$ is an even, symmetric double well with minima at $x=\\pm x_{0}$ of equal depth, hence $P_{st}(+x_{0})=P_{st}(-x_{0})$.
