The characteristic equation for a 2x2 matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\lambda^2 - (\\text{tr}(A))\\lambda + \\det(A) = 0$.

Since the real parts are zero, the equilibrium point $(1, 0)$ is **not** hyperbolic. This corresponds to a center in the linearized system.\n\n**Case 3: Equilibrium point $P_3 = (-1, 0)$**\nEvaluate the Jacobian at $(-1, 0)$:\n$$\nJ(-1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 - 3(-1)^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 - 3 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the same Jacobian matrix as for the point $(1, 0)$.
