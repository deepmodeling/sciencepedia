This exercise reveals the beautiful combinatorial structure underlying chaotic dynamics.", "problem": "Consider the dynamics of a Smale horseshoe map, denoted by $f$, acting on the unit square $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$. The mapping process can be described in three steps:\n1.  **Contraction and Expansion**: The square $S$ is uniformly contracted in the horizontal direction by a factor $\\lambda$ (where $0  \\lambda  1/2$) and uniformly expanded in the vertical direction by a factor $1/\\mu$ (where $0  \\mu  1/2$).\n2.  **Folding**: The resulting tall, thin rectangle is bent into a horseshoe shape.\n3.  **Intersection**: The horseshoe is placed back over the original square $S$. The intersection of the image of the map with the square, $f(S) \\cap S$, consists of two disjoint vertical strips, $V_0$ and $V_1$. Each of these strips spans the full height of the square from $y=0$ to $y=1$.\n\nThe set of points that remain in the square $S$ under all forward and backward iterations of the map forms the non-wandering set $\\Lambda$. The dynamics on this set can be studied using a Markov partition. For the horseshoe map, a natural partition is constructed from the preimages of the square $S$. The set of points in $S$ that are mapped into $S$ by $f$, denoted $f^{-1}(S) \\cap S$, consists of two disjoint horizontal strips. Let these strips be denoted by $P_0$ and $P_1$. These two strips form the elements of our two-state Markov partition.\n\nThe dynamics on the non-wandering set $\\Lambda$ can be described by a sequence of symbols $\\{0, 1\\}$, where a point's trajectory is coded based on whether it lands in $P_0$ or $P_1$ at each time step. The allowed transitions between these states are captured by a $2 \\times 2$ transition matrix $A$. An element $A_{ij}$ (where $i, j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$) is defined to be $1$ if a transition from state $i$ to state $j$ is possible, and $0$ otherwise.

This is the intersection of the vertical strip $V_0$ with the horizontal strip $P_0$. Since $V_0$ spans the full height of the square and $P_0$ is a horizontal strip within that square, their interiors must intersect. Thus, $\\text{int}(f(P_0)) \\cap \\text{int}(P_0) \\neq \\emptyset$, which means $A_{00} = 1$.\n    -   To find $A_{01}$, we check the intersection of $f(P_0)$ with $P_1$.

For the same reason as above, since $V_0$ spans the full height and $P_1$ is a horizontal strip in the square, their interiors must intersect. Thus, $\\text{int}(f(P_0)) \\cap \\text{int}(P_1) \\neq \\emptyset$, which means $A_{01} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Transitions from state 1**: We examine the image of $P_1$, which is $f(P_1) = V_1$.\n    -   To find $A_{10}$, we check the intersection of $f(P_1)$ with $P_0$. This is the intersection of the vertical strip $V_1$ with the horizontal strip $P_0$. Since $V_1$ also spans the full height of the square, its interior intersects the interior of $P_0$. Thus, $\\text{int}(f(P_1)) \\cap \\text{int}(P_0) \\neq \\emptyset$, which means $A_{10} = 1$.\n    -   To find $A_{11}$, we check the intersection of $f(P_1)$ with $P_1$.
