The new, perturbed system is described by the equations:\n$$ \\dot{r} = \\mu r (R^2 - r^2) $$\n$$ \\dot{\\theta} = \\omega $$\nHere, $\\mu$ and $R$ are positive real constants.

A limit cycle is a periodic orbit, which in this system corresponds to a trajectory with a constant radius $r$. For the radius to be constant, its time derivative $\\dot{r}$ must be zero.\nThe equation for the radial dynamics is given by:\n$$ \\dot{r} = \\mu r (R^2 - r^2) $$\nSetting $\\dot{r} = 0$ gives:\n$$ \\mu r (R^2 - r^2) = 0 $$\nSince $\\mu$ is a positive constant, this equation has solutions at $r=0$ (a fixed point at the origin) and $R^2 - r^2 = 0$. The second condition gives $r^2 = R^2$. Since the radius $r$ must be non-negative, we find $r = R$. A trajectory with $r(t)=R$ and $\\theta(t) = \\omega t + \\theta_0$ is a periodic orbit. This is the limit cycle of the system.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of this limit cycle by considering a small perturbation from it.
