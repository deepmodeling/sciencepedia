However, for the specific monofractal described here, the spectrum collapses to a single point. Determine the coordinates $(\\alpha, f(\\alpha))$ of this point. Your answer should be an ordered pair expressed in terms of the capacity dimension $D_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the coordinates $(\\alpha, f(\\alpha))$ of the point that constitutes the singularity spectrum for a monofractal.\n\nFirst, let's determine the measure $p_i(\\epsilon)$ for any non-empty box. We are given that the measure is uniform across all $N(\\epsilon)$ non-empty boxes. Let this uniform measure be $p(\\epsilon)$. The total measure is normalized to 1, so we must have:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N(\\epsilon)} p_i(\\epsilon) = 1 $$\nSince $p_i(\\epsilon) = p(\\epsilon)$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $N(\\epsilon)$, this sum becomes:\n$$ N(\\epsilon) \\cdot p(\\epsilon) = 1 $$\nThis gives us the measure of any single non-empty box:\n$$ p(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{N(\\epsilon)} $$\n\nNext, we are given the scaling relation for the number of non-empty boxes: $N(\\epsilon) = C \\epsilon^{-D_0}$, where $D_0$ is the capacity dimension. For scaling purposes (as $\\epsilon \\to 0$), we can ignore the constant prefactor $C$ and write $N(\\epsilon) \\sim \\epsilon^{-D_0}$. Substituting this into our expression for $p(\\epsilon)$:\n$$ p(\\epsilon) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{-D_0}} = \\epsilon^{D_0} $$\n\nNow, let's find the singularity strength, $\\alpha$. The singularity strength is defined by the scaling law for the measure in a box, $p(\\epsilon) \\sim \\epsilon^{\\alpha}$. By comparing the definition with the result we just derived for our monofractal, we have:\n$$ \\epsilon^{\\alpha} \\sim \\epsilon^{D_0} $$\nThis implies that for any point on the monofractal, the singularity strength is constant and equal to the capacity dimension:\n$$ \\alpha = D_0 $$\nSince there is only one possible value for the singularity strength, the $f(\\alpha)$ spectrum is non-zero only at this single value of $\\alpha$.\n\nFinally, we need to determine the value of $f(\\alpha)$ at $\\alpha = D_0$. The function $f(\\alpha)$ is defined as the fractal dimension of the set of points that have a singularity strength of $\\alpha$. In this case, we found that *all* points in the fractal set have the same singularity strength $\\alpha = D_0$. Therefore, the set of points with $\\alpha=D_0$ is the entire fractal set itself.\n\nBy definition, the fractal dimension of the entire set is its capacity dimension, $D_0$. Thus, the value of the singularity spectrum at $\\alpha = D_0$ is:\n$$ f(D_0) = D_0 $$\n\nSo, the $f(\\alpha)$ spectrum collapses to a single point whose coordinates are given by $(\\alpha, f(\\alpha))$.
