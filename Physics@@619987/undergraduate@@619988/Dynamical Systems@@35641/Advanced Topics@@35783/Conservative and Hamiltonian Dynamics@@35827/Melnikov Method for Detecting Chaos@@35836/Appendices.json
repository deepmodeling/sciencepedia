The theorem states that chaos, characterized by the transverse intersection of stable and unstable manifolds, occurs if the Melnikov function $M(t_0)$ has simple zeros.\n\nThe Melnikov function for the system is given by:\n$$M(t_0) = \\delta \\sin(\\Omega t_0) - \\gamma$$\nwhere $\\delta, \\gamma, \\Omega$ are all positive constants.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the condition for the existence of zeros. We set $M(t_0) = 0$:\n$$\\delta \\sin(\\Omega t_0) - \\gamma = 0$$\n$$\\sin(\\Omega t_0) = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta}$$\nThe sine function, $\\sin(x)$, has a range of $[-1, 1]$. Therefore, for the equation $\\sin(\\Omega t_0) = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta}$ to have any real solutions for $t_0$, the value of the right-hand side must be within this range. That is:\n$$-1 \\le \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta} \\le 1$$\nSince $\\delta$ and $\\gamma$ are both defined as positive constants, the ratio $\\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta}$ is always positive. Thus, the condition simplifies to:\n$$0 < \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta} \\le 1$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$\\gamma \\le \\delta$$\n\nNext, we must check if these zeros are simple. A zero is simple if the derivative of the Melnikov function, $M'(t_0)$, is non-zero at the time $t_0$ where $M(t_0)=0$. Let's compute the derivative:\n$$M'(t_0) = \\frac{d}{dt_0} \\left( \\delta \\sin(\\Omega t_0) - \\gamma \\right) = \\delta \\Omega \\cos(\\Omega t_0)$$\nWe need to evaluate this derivative at the points where $\\sin(\\Omega t_0) = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta}$. We can use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1$ to find the value of $\\cos(\\Omega t_0)$ at these points.\n$$\\cos^2(\\Omega t_0) = 1 - \\sin^2(\\Omega t_0) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta}\\right)^2$$\nSo, $\\cos(\\Omega t_0) = \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta}\\right)^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the derivative:\n$$M'(t_0) = \\delta \\Omega \\left( \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta}\\right)^2} \\right)$$\nFor the zero to be simple, we need $M'(t_0) \\neq 0$. Since $\\delta > 0$ and $\\Omega > 0$, this requires that the term under the square root is non-zero.\n$$1 - \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta}\\right)^2 \\neq 0$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta}\\right)^2 \\neq 1$$\nSince $\\gamma/\\delta > 0$, this means $\\frac{\\gamma}{\\delta} \\neq 1$, which implies $\\gamma \\neq \\delta$.\n\nCombining the conditions:\n1.  For zeros to exist, we need $\\gamma \\le \\delta$.\n2.  For these zeros to be simple, we need $\\gamma \\neq \\delta$.\n\nTogether, these two conditions imply that simple zeros exist if and only if $\\gamma < \\delta$.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the condition when transverse intersections first occur. This corresponds to the threshold case. As the ratio $\\gamma/\\delta$ decreases, the first real solutions appear when $\\gamma/\\delta = 1$, or $\\gamma = \\delta$. At this critical point, we have $\\sin(\\Omega t_0) = 1$. The zeros are not simple, as $M'(t_0) = 0$ at this point, which corresponds to a tangential intersection (a non-transverse homoclinic tangency). For any value of $\\gamma$ slightly less than $\\delta$ (i.e., $\\delta > \\gamma$), the right side of $\\sin(\\Omega t_0) = \\gamma/\\delta$ is less than 1, and there will be two distinct simple zeros per period of the sine function. This ensures transverse intersections. Therefore, chaotic dynamics are predicted to occur for $\\delta > \\gamma$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Chaos occurs for any values of $\\delta > 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$. This is incorrect, as if $\\gamma > \\delta$, $\\sin(\\Omega t_0) > 1$, which has no real solution, so there are no intersections.\nB. Chaos occurs if and only if $\\delta > \\gamma$. This matches our derivation. If $\\delta > \\gamma$, then $\\gamma/\\delta < 1$, so simple zeros exist, and transverse intersections occur.\nC. Chaos occurs if and only if $\\gamma > \\delta$. This is incorrect. This condition leads to no intersections.\nD. The system is never chaotic because the dissipative term $\\gamma$ prevents intersections. This is incorrect. Dissipation can be overcome if the driving force (related to $\\delta$) is strong enough.\nE. The system is never chaotic because the Melnikov function is periodic. This is a misunderstanding of the theorem. The periodicity of the forcing leads to the periodic nature of the Melnikov function, but the existence of simple zeros within a period is the critical condition for chaos.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the onset of chaos is $\\delta > \\gamma$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1693134"}, {"introduction": "To truly master the Melnikov method, one must move from interpretation to direct calculation.
