Arnold diffusion refers to the slow, chaotic drift of trajectories through large regions of phase space along a network of resonances.\n\nA. Arnold diffusion is expected. The system effectively has three degrees of freedom (two spatial and one from time), which is the minimum required. In such a system, the surviving invariant tori from the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem are not sufficient to divide the phase space and confine chaotic trajectories.\n\nB. Arnold diffusion is not expected. The system has only two degrees of freedom corresponding to motion in the x and y directions. In systems with two or fewer degrees of freedom, surviving invariant tori act as impenetrable barriers in phase space, preventing the long-range drift characteristic of Arnold diffusion.\n\nC. Arnold diffusion is not expected. The unperturbed system is integrable, and the perturbation is weak. According to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem, this ensures the long-term stability of most trajectories by preserving slightly deformed versions of the original invariant tori, which prevents any significant diffusion-like behavior.\n\nD. Arnold diffusion is expected. The time-dependent nature of the perturbation breaks the conservation of energy. The lack of energy conservation is the primary mechanism that allows trajectories to diffuse across different energy levels, a phenomenon synonymous with Arnold diffusion.\n\nE. Arnold diffusion is not expected. The specific sinusoidal form of the potential is highly structured and only excites a very narrow set of resonances in the system.

However, the dynamical consequences differ by $n$:\n- For an autonomous system with $n=2$, the constant-energy manifold has dimension $2n-1=3$, while invariant tori are $n$-dimensional ($2$-dimensional) surfaces. Such $2$-tori can act as impenetrable barriers on the $3$-dimensional energy surface, preventing global transport.\n- For an autonomous system with $n=3$, the constant-energy manifold has dimension $2n-1=5$, while invariant tori are $3$-dimensional; such $3$-tori cannot partition a $5$-dimensional manifold. Their complement contains resonance layers forming a connected web that can enable slow drift of the actions, i.e., Arnold diffusion.\n\nIn the present problem, because of the periodic time dependence, the correct autonomous description has $n=3$, not $n=2$. The resonance condition in the nearly integrable regime takes the form\n$$\nk\\cdot \\Omega(J)+l\\,\\omega=0,\\qquad k\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{2},\\ l\\in\\mathbb{Z},\n$$\nwhich, even for a single temporal harmonic and a single spatial Fourier mode in configuration space, generates infinitely many resonances through integer combinations $(k,l)$. These resonances, together with the splitting of stable and unstable manifolds for perturbed hyperbolic invariant sets, can form a resonance web along which slow chaotic drift (Arnold diffusion) may occur. KAM tori persist for most initial conditions but do not divide the energy manifold when $n=3$, so they do not preclude such diffusion; Nekhoroshev theory further implies that any drift is typically exponentially slow in $\\epsilon$ but does not vanish.\n\nWe now assess each statement:\n\nA. Correct. The time-periodic system is equivalent to an autonomous nearly integrable Hamiltonian with $n=3$ degrees of freedom. In $n=3$, surviving KAM tori are insufficient to partition the energy manifold, so Arnold diffusion can, in principle, occur.\n\nB. Incorrect. It neglects the time degree of freedom. A time-periodic $2$-degree-of-freedom system lifts to an autonomous $n=3$ system, for which Arnold diffusion is possible.\n\nC. Incorrect as stated. While KAM ensures most tori persist for small $\\epsilon$, in $n=3$ those tori do not act as global barriers; their persistence does not rule out Arnold diffusion in the gaps.\n\nD. Incorrect reasoning. Although energy is not conserved in the time-dependent system, the lack of energy conservation is not the defining or primary mechanism of Arnold diffusion; classic Arnold diffusion occurs in autonomous systems where energy is conserved. The correct rationale hinges on the number of degrees of freedom and the resonance web.\n\nE. Incorrect. A single sinusoidal perturbation still produces infinitely many resonances via integer combinations $(k,l)$; there is no general obstruction to forming a resonance web from such a perturbation under generic nondegeneracy.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1662075"}, {"introduction": "The phase space of a nearly integrable system is a complex tapestry of both chaotic and regular regions.
