The state of the neuron is given by a phase $\\theta_n \\in [0, 1)$ at discrete time steps $n$. The neuron is subjected to an external periodic stimulus.

For certain ranges of the stimulus parameters (amplitude and frequency), the neuron's firing rate locks to a rational multiple of the stimulus frequency. These regions of parameter space are known as 'Arnold tongues', and the stability and width of a tongue are related to the complexity of its corresponding rational winding number.\n\nAn experimenter fixes the stimulus amplitude and carefully tunes its frequency. Two distinct and stable mode-locked states are observed. The first state has a winding number $\\rho_1 = 2/5$, meaning the neuron fires exactly 2 times for every 5 cycles of the stimulus. The second state, found at a different stimulus frequency, has a winding number of $\\rho_2 = 3/7$.\n\nBased on the theory of how Arnold tongues are structured, predict the winding number of the most prominent (i.e., widest and most stable) new mode-locked state that one would expect to find by continuously varying the stimulus frequency between the values that produced $\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_2$.", "solution": "We use the standard circle-map/Arnold tongue theory: mode-locked states correspond to rational winding numbers $\\rho=p/q$ (with $p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, $q>0$), and as a control parameter (here, the stimulus frequency) is varied, the winding number as a function of that parameter forms a devilâ€™s staircase.
