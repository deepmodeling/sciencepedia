This first practice challenges you to identify the fundamental graphical signature of GS, helping you build an intuitive understanding of what synchronization looks like in raw data.", "problem": "An engineer is investigating the thermal behavior of a novel two-component electronic device. The device consists of a central processing unit (CPU) and a closely-coupled graphics processing unit (GPU). The engineer measures the temperature of the CPU, $T_C(t)$, and the temperature of the GPU, $T_G(t)$, over a long operational period under a fluctuating computational load.\n\nThe engineer hypothesizes that the system exhibits a phenomenon known as Generalized Synchronization (GS). In the context of this system, GS would mean that after an initial warm-up phase, the state of one component (e.g., the GPU temperature) is completely and uniquely determined by the state of the other component (the CPU temperature). Mathematically, this would imply the existence of a function $\\Phi$ such that $T_G(t) = \\Phi(T_C(t))$. The function $\\Phi$ itself might be quite complicated and is not known beforehand.\n\nGiven the two time-series datasets for $T_C(t)$ and $T_G(t)$, the engineer wants to perform the most direct graphical test to find a preliminary indication of this hypothesized functional relationship.\n\nWhich of the following plots would be the most direct and appropriate method for this preliminary investigation?\n\nA.

The most direct implication of $T_{G}(t) = \\Phi(T_{C}(t))$ is that the set of paired measurements\n$$\n\\{(T_{C}(t),\\,T_{G}(t)):\\, t\\ \\text{in observation window}\\}\n$$\nlies on the graph of the function $\\Phi$, i.e., a one-dimensional curve in the $(T_{C},T_{G})$ plane with a single $T_{G}$ value for each $T_{C}$ value (up to noise). Therefore, the most direct preliminary graphical test is to make a scatter plot of $T_{G}(t)$ versus $T_{C}(t)$ and check whether the points concentrate on a single-valued curve.\n\nWe now examine the listed options in light of $T_{G}(t) = \\Phi(T_{C}(t))$.\n\n- Option A (plot $T_{C}(t)$ versus $t$) only shows the temporal evolution of $T_{C}$ and does not directly test for a functional relationship between $T_{G}$ and $T_{C}$.\n\n- Option B (plot a moving average of $T_{G}(t)$ versus $t$) also only displays temporal behavior, not the functional dependence of $T_{G}$ on $T_{C}$.\n\n- Option C (plot $T_{G}(t) - T_{C}(t)$ versus $t$) would only be informative if $\\Phi$ were of the special form $\\Phi(x) = x$ (or, more generally, if one were testing a simple linear offset or proportionality). For a general nonlinear $\\Phi$, the residual $T_{G}(t) - T_{C}(t)$ depends on $T_{C}(t)$, not directly on $t$, so plotting it against $t$ does not directly reveal the function $\\Phi$.\n\n- Option D (plot $T_{G}(t)$ versus $T_{C}(t)$) directly tests whether the data lie on a single-valued curve $T_{G} = \\Phi(T_{C})$, which is the defining graphical signature of GS in terms of the measured observables.\n\n- Option E (plot $\\frac{dT_{G}}{dt}$ versus $\\frac{dT_{C}}{dt}$) is not directly appropriate. If $T_{G} = \\Phi(T_{C})$ with $\\Phi$ differentiable, then by the chain rule\n$$\n\\frac{dT_{G}}{dt} = \\Phi'(T_{C}) \\frac{dT_{C}}{dt},\n$$\nso the relationship between the derivatives depends parametrically on $T_{C}$ via $\\Phi'(T_{C})$. Thus, a plot of $\\frac{dT_{G}}{dt}$ versus $\\frac{dT_{C}}{dt}$ will generally not collapse onto a single curve independent of $T_{C}$, and numerical differentiation amplifies noise, making it a poor preliminary test.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and appropriate preliminary graphical test for $T_{G}(t) = \\Phi(T_{C}(t))$ is to plot $T_{G}(t)$ versus $T_{C}(t)$ and examine whether the points lie on a single-valued curve, which corresponds to Option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1679226"}, {"introduction": "While visual inspection of plots can be suggestive, it may not be conclusive, especially in the presence of noise or complex dynamics. The auxiliary system method provides a more rigorous and robust numerical test for generalized synchronization. This exercise asks you to grasp the core principle of this technique by identifying its definitive analytical signature, which confirms that the response system's state is uniquely determined by the drive system's state.", "problem": "A physicist is investigating a coupled system composed of a \"drive\" subsystem and a \"response\" subsystem. The state of the drive is described by a vector $\\mathbf{x}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$, and its evolution is governed by the autonomous differential equation $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{x})$. The state of the response is a vector $\\mathbf{y}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, and its dynamics are given by the non-autonomous equation $\\dot{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{x})$.\n\nTo test for the presence of Generalized Synchronization (GS), where the state of the response system becomes a function of the drive system's state (i.e., $\\mathbf{y}(t) \\to \\phi(\\mathbf{x}(t))$ after a transient period), the physicist uses the auxiliary system method. An auxiliary system, identical to the response system, is introduced. Its state is denoted by $\\mathbf{y'}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and it evolves according to $\\dot{\\mathbf{y'}} = \\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y'}, \\mathbf{x})$.\n\nA numerical experiment is conducted by integrating the three systems simultaneously.

Generalized Synchronization (GS) is defined by the existence of a (possibly nonlinear) function $\\phi$ such that, after transients, $\\mathbf{y}(t)=\\phi(\\mathbf{x}(t))$.

Therefore, the definitive numerical signature of GS by the auxiliary system method is that the distance $D(t)=||\\mathbf{y}(t)-\\mathbf{y'}(t)||$ tends to zero for large $t$.\n\nWe now evaluate the options in light of this criterion. Option C states exactly the auxiliary-system signature $D(t)\\to 0$ as $t\\to\\infty$, which is both necessary and sufficient for GS within this method. Option A, $||\\mathbf{y}(t)||\\to||\\mathbf{x}(t)||$, is neither necessary nor sufficient for GS, since GS does not require any particular relation between norms or linear observables across systems of different dimensions. Option B, convergence of all systems to a single fixed point, is not a definitive marker of GS because it can occur without a functional relation beyond the trivial fixed point and does not test the uniqueness of the response conditioned on the driveâ€™s trajectory. Option D, existence of a constant matrix $M$ with $||\\mathbf{y}(t)-M\\mathbf{x}(t)||\\to 0$, demands a linear functional relation and is too restrictive; GS allows general nonlinear $\\phi$, so this condition is not necessary. Option E describes the opposite of GS, indicating lack of synchronization between the response and auxiliary systems.\n\nThus, the definitive signature is given by Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1679175"}]}
