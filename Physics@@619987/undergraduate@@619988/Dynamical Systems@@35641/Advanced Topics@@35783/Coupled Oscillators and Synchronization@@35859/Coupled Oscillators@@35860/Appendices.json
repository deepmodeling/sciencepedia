This exercise provides hands-on practice with this core concept by challenging you to determine the precise initial conditions needed to isolate and excite a single normal mode. Mastering this helps build intuition for how any general motion can be seen as a combination of these simpler, pure oscillations [@problem_id:2185847].", "problem": "A simplified model for a dual-mass Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) resonator consists of two identical masses, each of mass $m$. Each mass is independently anchored by a flexure that acts as an ideal spring with a spring constant $k$. The two masses are coupled to each other by a weak interaction that can be modeled as an ideal spring with a coupling spring constant $k_c$. The motion of the masses is restricted to a single dimension. Let $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ be the one-dimensional displacements of the first and second masses, respectively, from their equilibrium positions.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the system is released from rest. The first mass is given an initial displacement of $x_1(0) = A_0$.

The springs to ground each provide a restoring force $-k x_{i}$, and the coupling spring provides forces proportional to the relative displacement, $-k_{c}(x_{1}-x_{2})$ on mass 1 and $-k_{c}(x_{2}-x_{1})$ on mass 2.

This thought experiment explores the intriguing case of a 'zero-frequency' normal mode, which corresponds to the uniform translation of the entire system through space. By analyzing a simple two-mass system free from external forces, you will connect the abstract concept of a normal mode coordinate to the physical principle of the conservation of momentum and the motion of the center of mass [@problem_id:2185856].", "problem": "Two small pods of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ are in deep space, far from any significant gravitational influence. They are connected by a single, massless, ideal spring of spring constant $k$. The system is initially at rest, with the spring at its natural equilibrium length. The motion of the pods is constrained to a single straight line passing through their centers.\n\nThe general motion of this system can be complex, but it can be simplified by describing it as a superposition of independent \"normal modes\". One of these normal modes corresponds to the pure translational motion of the system as a whole, where the entire apparatus moves with a constant velocity without any internal vibration. This mode can be described by a single coordinate, $q_T$, which is a specific linear combination of the individual pod positions, $x_1$ and $x_2$. This coordinate takes the general form $q_T = C(\\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2)$, where $C$ is an arbitrary non-zero scaling constant, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are coefficients that define the mode.\n\nFor this purely translational normal mode, determine the value of the ratio $\\beta/\\alpha$.", "solution": "Let $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ be the positions of the two pods of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, along the one-dimensional line of motion. Let the equilibrium length of the spring be $L_0$. The spring is ideal and massless.\n\nThe force exerted by the spring depends on its extension relative to its equilibrium length. The extension of the spring is $(x_2 - x_1) - L_0$.\nAccording to Hooke's Law, the force that the spring exerts on mass $m_1$ is:\n$$F_1 = +k( (x_2 - x_1) - L_0 )$$\nThe force on mass $m_2$ is equal and opposite, as dictated by Newton's third law:\n$$F_2 = -k( (x_2 - x_1) - L_0 ) = k( (x_1 - x_2) + L_0 )$$\n\nUsing Newton's second law, $F=ma$, we can write the equations of motion for each pod:\n$$m_1 \\ddot{x}_1 = k(x_2 - x_1 - L_0) \\quad (1)$$\n$$m_2 \\ddot{x}_2 = k(x_1 - x_2 + L_0) \\quad (2)$$\nHere, $\\ddot{x}$ denotes the second time derivative of the position $x$, which is the acceleration.\n\nThe problem states that there exists a normal coordinate $q_T$ that corresponds to the purely translational motion of the system. A purely translational motion at constant velocity means the acceleration associated with this coordinate is zero. This coordinate corresponds to the zero-frequency normal mode of the system.\n\nThe center of mass of the system is the coordinate that tracks the overall motion of the system. Since there are no external forces acting on the system (the spring forces are internal), the total momentum is conserved, and the center of mass must move at a constant velocity. Let's verify this.\n\nThe total force on the system is the sum of the forces on each part:\n$$F_{\\text{total}} = F_1 + F_2 = k(x_2 - x_1 - L_0) + k(x_1 - x_2 + L_0) = 0$$\nThe acceleration of the center of mass, $a_{CM}$, is given by $F_{\\text{total}} = (m_1+m_2)a_{CM}$.

We can equate this general form with the expression for the center of mass position, as they both describe the same physical motion.\n$$C(\\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2) = X_{CM} = \\frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2}{m_1 + m_2}$$\nWe can rewrite the right side to match the structure of the left side:\n$$C(\\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2) = \\left(\\frac{1}{m_1 + m_2}\\right) (m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2)$$\nFor this equality to hold for any positions $x_1$ and $x_2$, the coefficients of $x_1$ and $x_2$ on both sides must be proportional.\nBy comparing the coefficients of $x_1$:\n$$C\\alpha = \\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of $x_2$:\n$$C\\beta = \\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$$\nTo find the required ratio $\\beta/\\alpha$, we can divide the second equation by the first:\n$$\\frac{C\\beta}{C\\alpha} = \\frac{\\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}}{\\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}}$$\nThe constants $C$ and the denominator $(m_1+m_2)$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} = \\frac{m_2}{m_1}$$\nThis is the required ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{m_2}{m_1}}$$", "id": "2185856"}, {"introduction": "The principles of coupled oscillators have powerful engineering applications, such as protecting structures from resonant vibrations.
