Setting this to zero gives:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = -y^* = 0 \\implies y^* = 0\n$$\nSo, all fixed points must lie on the x-axis ($y=0$).\n\nNext, we evaluate the x-component of the velocity, $\\dot{x} = f(x, y)$, at these points, i.e., for $y=0$. According to the piecewise definition of $f(x, y)$, for $y=0$, we have:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = f(x, 0) = 0\n$$\nThis holds for all values of $x$. However, the problem statement provides a more detailed definition of $f(x,y)$ based on regions. The definition for $y=0$ applies across all $x$. This seems to imply the entire x-axis is a set of fixed points. Let's re-read the definition of $f(x,y)$ carefully. The condition $f(x,0)=0$ holds. However, for a point on the x-axis with $|x| \\ge 1$ to be a fixed point, the vector field in its neighborhood must also be considered. The problem is constructed such that any trajectory starting infinitesimally close to a point $(x_0, 0)$ with $|x_0| \\ge 1$ will be immediately pushed away from it in the x-direction (specifically, towards the strip $|x|<1$). For this reason, only the points in $S$ are stable attractors in their neighborhood on the x-axis, and it's standard to refer to the segment of stable fixed points as *the* fixed point set of interest. More formally, the problem is constructed such that the set of fixed points is exactly $S$. Let's assume the prompt intends for the stable part of the fixed line to be the relevant one, which is $S$.\n\nA more rigorous interpretation is that the provided piecewise definitions for $y>0$ have limits as $y \\to 0^+$.\n- For $|x| < 1$, $\\lim_{y \\to 0^+} f(x,y)$ does not exist due to $k(y)$.\n- For $x > 1$, $\\lim_{y \\to 0^+} f(x,y) = C(1-x) \\ne 0$.\n- For $x < -1$, $\\lim_{y \\to 0^+} f(x,y) = C(-1-x) \\ne 0$.\nThe only way for the flow to be continuous at $y=0$ is if the vector field is defined to be zero specifically on the segment $S = \\{(x,0) | |x|\\le 1\\}$. So this is the set of fixed points.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the trajectory and find $\\alpha$**\n\nWe consider a trajectory starting at $p=(0,1)$. The y-component of its motion is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{y} = -y\n$$\nThe solution with the initial condition $y(0)=1$ is:\n$$\ny(t) = e^{-t}\n$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, $y(t) \\to 0$. This confirms that the $\\omega$-limit set must be a subset of the x-axis.\n\nNow, we analyze the x-component of the motion, $x(t)$. The trajectory starts at $x(0)=0$, which is in the region $|x|<1$. The large value of $C$ ensures that the trajectory remains in the strip $|x| \\le 1$ for all $t>0$ (any excursion is immediately corrected). Thus, for our analysis, we can assume $|x(t)| \\le 1$ for all time, and the x-dynamics are governed by:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\alpha \\cdot k(y(t)) = \\alpha \\cdot k(e^{-t})\n$$\nThe function $k(y)$ is defined as $k(y) = (-1)^n$ for $y \\in (2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}]$. Let's find the time intervals corresponding to these y-intervals.\nLet $t_n$ be the time at which $y(t_n) = 2^{-n}$.\n$$\ne^{-t_n} = 2^{-n} \\implies -t_n = -n \\ln(2) \\implies t_n = n \\ln(2)\n$$\nThe trajectory is in the y-interval $(2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}]$ during the time interval $(t_n, t_{n+1}]$, which is $(n\\ln(2), (n+1)\\ln(2)]$. The duration of this time interval is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_n = (n+1)\\ln(2) - n\\ln(2) = \\ln(2)\n$$\nDuring this interval, $k(y(t)) = (-1)^n$, so $\\dot{x} = \\alpha (-1)^n$. Since this is constant over the interval, the displacement in $x$ during this interval is:\n$$\n\\Delta x_n = \\dot{x} \\cdot \\Delta t_n = \\alpha (-1)^n \\ln(2)\n$$\nThe trajectory starts at $x(0)=0$. For $n=0$, the time interval is $(0, \\ln(2)]$.\n- The displacement is $\\Delta x_0 = \\alpha (-1)^0 \\ln(2) = \\alpha \\ln(2)$. At time $t_1=\\ln(2)$, the position is $x(t_1) = \\alpha \\ln(2)$.\nFor the trajectory to sweep the segment $[-1, 1]$, at the end of the first 'sweep' to the right, the position should be $x=1$. Thus, we set:\n$$\nx(t_1) = 1 \\implies \\alpha \\ln(2) = 1 \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{1}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nLet's check if this value of $\\alpha$ works for subsequent sweeps.\nFor $n=1$, the time interval is $(\\ln(2), 2\\ln(2)]$.\n- The displacement is $\\Delta x_1 = \\alpha (-1)^1 \\ln(2) = -\\frac{1}{\\ln(2)} \\ln(2) = -1$.\n- The position at $t_2=2\\ln(2)$ is $x(t_2) = x(t_1) + \\Delta x_1 = 1 + (-1) = 0$.\n$x(t_3) = x(2\\ln(2)) + \\Delta x_2 = 0 + \\alpha(1)\\ln(2) = 1$.\n$x(t_4) = x(3\\ln(2)) + \\Delta x_3 = 1 + \\alpha(-1)\\ln(2) = 0$.\n\nThe trajectory oscillates between $x=0$ and $x=1$. The $\\omega$-limit set would be the segment $[0, 1]$ on the x-axis, not $[-1,1]$.\n\nLet's re-examine the sweeping motion. The total width of the target segment is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\nA full cycle of motion (one sweep right, one sweep left) should cover the entire segment.\nLet's say the rightward sweep starts from $x=-1$ and ends at $x=1$. The displacement must be $\\Delta x = 2$.\nDuring a rightward sweep (e.g., for even $n$), the displacement is $\\Delta x_n = \\alpha \\ln(2)$.\nWe require this displacement to be equal to the width of the segment:\n$$\n\\alpha \\ln(2) = 2\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{2}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nLet's verify this. Let the particle start at $x_i = -1$.\n- After a rightward sweep (duration $\\ln 2$), $x_f = x_i + \\Delta x = -1 + \\frac{2}{\\ln(2)}\\ln(2) = -1+2 = 1$.\n- After a subsequent leftward sweep (duration $\\ln 2$), the displacement is $-\\frac{2}{\\ln(2)}\\ln(2) = -2$. The new position is $x_f' = x_f - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1$.\nSo, with this value of $\\alpha$, the trajectory oscillates between $x=-1$ and $x=1$. As $t\\to\\infty$, $y(t)\\to 0$, and the x-position sweeps the interval $[-1,1]$ infinitely often.\nThe set of limit points in the x-coordinate is the entire interval $[-1,1]$. The y-coordinate's only limit point is $0$. Therefore, the $\\omega$-limit set is $\\omega(p) = \\{(x,0) | -1 \\le x \\le 1\\} = S$.\n\nThe starting point $p=(0,1)$ is not at the edge.\nAt $t=0$, $y=1$. $y \\in (1/2, 1] = (2^{-1}, 2^0]$, so $n=0$. $k(y)=1$.\n$\\dot{x} = \\alpha = 2/\\ln(2)$.\nFirst interval is from $t=0$ to $t_1=\\ln(2)$.\n$x(\\ln 2) = x(0) + \\int_0^{\\ln 2} \\frac{2}{\\ln 2} dt = 0 + \\frac{2}{\\ln 2} \\ln 2 = 2$.\nThis makes the particle exit the region $|x|<1$. The assumption that the particle stays in $|x|\\le 1$ is violated.\n\nThe problem states \"assume the constant C is sufficiently large to ensure that whenever a trajectory has $|x| \\ge 1$, it is rapidly forced back into the strip $|x|<1$\". This implies that the trajectory essentially \"bounces\" off the boundaries at $x=1$ and $x=-1$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate based on this \"bouncing\" behavior.\nStarting at $x=0$, $\\dot{x}=\\alpha > 0$. The particle moves right. It will hit $x=1$ at some time $t_{hit} < \\ln(2)$.\nThe time to go from $x=0$ to $x=1$ is $t_{hit} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\dot{x}} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}$.\nAt $t_{hit}$, the particle is at $(1, e^{-1/\\alpha})$. It then stays at $x=1$ (or very close to it) because the restoring force from $C(1-x)$ balances the push from $\\alpha k(y)$, until the time $t_1 = \\ln(2)$ is reached.\nAt $t_1=\\ln(2)$, the value of $k(y)$ switches to $-1$. Now $\\dot{x}=-\\alpha$. The particle moves left from $x=1$.\nIt will travel from $x=1$ to $x=-1$. The displacement is $-2$.\nTime taken for this sweep is $t_{sweep} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\dot{x}} = \\frac{-2}{-\\alpha} = \\frac{2}{\\alpha}$.\nSo at time $t_1+t_{sweep} = \\ln(2) + 2/\\alpha$, the particle reaches $x=-1$.\nThe y-value is in the range $(2^{-2}, 2^{-1}]$. The time for this y-range is from $\\ln(2)$ to $2\\ln(2)$. The duration is $\\ln(2)$.\nSo we need the sweep time to be equal to the interval duration $\\ln(2)$.\n$$\n\\frac{2}{\\alpha} = \\ln(2) \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{2}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThis brings us back to the same result. The logic is that each sweep from one boundary ($x=1$) to the other ($x=-1$) must take exactly the time duration of one y-interval, which is $\\ln(2)$. A rightward sweep from $x=-1$ to $x=1$ has displacement $+2$, driven by $\\dot{x}=\\alpha$. Time is $2/\\alpha$. A leftward sweep from $x=1$ to $x=-1$ has displacement $-2$, driven by $\\dot{x}=-\\alpha$. Time is $-2/(-\\alpha) = 2/\\alpha$.\nFor the trajectory to perfectly trace out the segment in the limit, the time for a full sweep must match the time for the y-level to change the driving direction.\nSo, we set the sweep time $2/\\alpha$ equal to the interval duration $\\ln(2)$.\nThis gives $\\alpha = \\frac{2}{\\ln(2)}$. With this value, the trajectory will repeatedly sweep between the boundaries $x=-1$ and $x=1$ as $y$ goes to zero, ensuring every point in the segment $S$ is a limit point.\nThe required value is for $\\alpha$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{\\ln(2)}}$$", "id": "1727772"}]}
