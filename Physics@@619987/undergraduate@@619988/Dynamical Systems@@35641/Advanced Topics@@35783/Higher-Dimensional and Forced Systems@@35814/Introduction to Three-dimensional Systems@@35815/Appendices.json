The stability is determined by the sign of the real parts of the eigenvalues.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3  -1  1 \\\\\n1  1  -2 \\\\\n0  0  -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFirst, we find the characteristic equation, which is given by $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the 3x3 identity matrix and $\\lambda$ represents the eigenvalues.\n$$\nA - \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 - \\lambda  -1  1 \\\\\n1  1 - \\lambda  -2 \\\\\n0  0  -1 - \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the determinant of this matrix.

We have one negative real eigenvalue: $\\lambda_1 = -1$. This corresponds to a stable direction in the phase space.\n2.  We have a positive real eigenvalue: $\\lambda_2 = 2$. This corresponds to an unstable direction in the phase space.\n\nSince the set of eigenvalues contains at least one eigenvalue with a positive real part ($\\lambda_2 = 2$) and at least one eigenvalue with a negative real part ($\\lambda_1 = -1$), the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point. Trajectories starting near the origin will be repelled away in some directions (the unstable eigenspace) and attracted towards the origin in another direction (the stable eigenspace).\n\nAs a point of interest, we can check if the matrix is defective for the repeated eigenvalue $\\lambda=2$. We find the geometric multiplicity by calculating the nullity of $(A - 2I)$:\n$$\nA - 2I = \\begin{pmatrix}\n3-2  -1  1 \\\\\n1  1-2  -2 \\\\\n0  0  -1-2\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1  1 \\\\\n1  -1  -2 \\\\\n0  0  -3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the nullity, we find the rank by row reduction.\nSubtracting the first row from the second row ($R_2 \\to R_2 - R_1$):\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1  -1  1 \\\\\n0  0  -3 \\\\\n0  0  -3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe third row is a multiple of the second, so it can be zeroed out. The matrix has two linearly independent rows (pivots in column 1 and 3), so its rank is 2.\nThe geometric multiplicity is given by $n - \\text{rank}(A - \\lambda I)$, where $n=3$.\nGeometric Multiplicity = $3 - 2 = 1$.\nSince the geometric multiplicity (1) is less than the algebraic multiplicity (2) for the eigenvalue $\\lambda=2$, the matrix is defective. This affects the shape of the trajectories within the unstable eigenspace, but it does not change the overall classification of the fixed point as a saddle point. The classification as a saddle point only depends on the presence of eigenvalues with both positive and negative real parts.\n\nThus, the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point.
