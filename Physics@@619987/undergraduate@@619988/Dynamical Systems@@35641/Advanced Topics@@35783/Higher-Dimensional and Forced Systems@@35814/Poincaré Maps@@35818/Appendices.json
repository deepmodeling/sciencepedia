The process involves three main steps: solving the system of differential equations for a general trajectory, finding the time it takes to return to the section, and then evaluating the state at that return time.\n\nFirst, we solve the system of differential equations. Let's consider a particle that starts on the Poincaré section $\\Sigma$ at time $t=0$. The initial conditions are therefore $x(0) = 0$ and $y(0) = y_n$.\n\nThe equation for the $x$-coordinate is $\\dot{x} = \\frac{dx}{dt} = v$. We can integrate this equation with respect to time:\n$$\n\\int_{x(0)}^{x(t)} dx' = \\int_{0}^{t} v \\, dt'\n$$\n$$\nx(t) - x(0) = vt\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $x(0)=0$, we find the solution for $x(t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = vt\n$$\nThe equation for the $y$-coordinate is $\\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\alpha y$. This is a first-order linear homogeneous differential equation, which can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{y} = -\\alpha \\, dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state at $t=0$ to the state at time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{y(0)}^{y(t)} \\frac{dy'}{y'} = \\int_{0}^{t} (-\\alpha) \\, dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(y(t)) - \\ln(y(0)) = -\\alpha t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{y(t)}{y(0)}\\right) = -\\alpha t\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $y(0)=y_n$ and exponentiating both sides, we get the solution for $y(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{y(t)}{y_n} = \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\implies y(t) = y_n \\exp(-\\alpha t)\n$$\nSo, the trajectory of the particle starting from $(0, y_n)$ is given by the parametric equations $(x(t), y(t)) = (vt, y_n \\exp(-\\alpha t))$.\n\nNext, we need to find the first-return time, $T$. The particle starts on the section $\\Sigma$ where $x=0$. It completes one full revolution around the cylinder and returns to the section $\\Sigma$ when its $x$-coordinate has traveled a distance equal to the circumference $L$. We need to find the smallest time $T > 0$ for which $x(T)$ corresponds to the line $x=0$. Given the cylindrical geometry where $x=L$ is identified with $x=0$, this occurs when $x(T) = L$.\n$$\nx(T) = vT = L\n$$\nSolving for the first-return time $T$:\n$$\nT = \\frac{L}{v}\n$$\n\nFinally, we determine the axial position $y_{n+1}$ at this first-return time $T$. The Poincaré map $P$ gives $y_{n+1} = P(y_n) = y(T)$. We substitute $t=T=L/v$ into our solution for $y(t)$:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y(T) = y_n \\exp(-\\alpha T) = y_n \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{L}{v}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression gives the next axial position $y_{n+1}$ as a function of the previous position $y_n$ and the system parameters.

The map $P$ is induced by a smooth flow and $\\Sigma$ is a transversal section; moreover, trajectories in a planar flow do not intersect, which preserves the radial ordering between successive crossings. Hence $P$ is strictly increasing near $x^{*}$:\n$$\nx_{1}<x_{2}\\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad P(x_{1})<P(x_{2}).\n$$\nTherefore $P'(x^{*})>0$. Combining positivity with the repelling nature of $x^{*}$ for a $C^{1}$ increasing map yields\n$$\nP'(x^{*})>1.\n$$\n\nEquivalently, one can use Floquet theory.
