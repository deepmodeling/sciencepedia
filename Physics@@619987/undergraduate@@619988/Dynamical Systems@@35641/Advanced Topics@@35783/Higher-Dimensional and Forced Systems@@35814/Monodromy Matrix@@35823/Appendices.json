The stability of the trap, i.e., its ability to confine the atom, depends on the stability of the zero solution $\\mathbf{x}(t) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThe evolution of the system over one period is described by the monodromy matrix $M$, which maps the state at time $t$ to the state at time $t+T$. The stability of the zero solution is determined by the magnitudes of the eigenvalues of $M$, also known as Floquet multipliers.

We analyze this based on the value of the discriminant, $\\Delta = \\alpha^2 - 4$.\n\nCase 1: $|\\alpha| > 2$.\nIn this case, $\\alpha^2 > 4$, so the discriminant $\\Delta = \\alpha^2 - 4$ is positive. This means the two eigenvalues, $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$, are real and distinct. Their product is given by the constant term in the characteristic polynomial, so $\\mu_1 \\mu_2 = \\det(M) = 1$. Since the eigenvalues are real and their product is 1, one must be greater than 1 in magnitude and the other must be less than 1 in magnitude. For example, if $\\alpha > 2$, then $\\mu_1 = (\\alpha + \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 - 4})/2 > (2+0)/2 = 1$. If $\\alpha < -2$, then $\\mu_2 = (\\alpha - \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 - 4})/2 < (-2-0)/2 = -1$. In either subcase, there is an eigenvalue with magnitude greater than 1. This leads to unbounded solutions, so the system is unstable.\n\nCase 2: $|\\alpha| < 2$.\nIn this case, $\\alpha^2 < 4$, so the discriminant $\\Delta = \\alpha^2 - 4$ is negative.

Both eigenvalues lie on the unit circle. Since $|\\alpha| < 2$, the eigenvalues are distinct complex conjugates, which guarantees that the monodromy matrix $M$ is diagonalizable. Therefore, the solutions are bounded, and the system is stable (specifically, neutrally stable).\n\nCase 3: $|\\alpha| = 2$.\nIn this case, $\\alpha^2 = 4$, so the discriminant is zero. This results in a repeated real eigenvalue:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{2} $$\nIf $\\alpha=2$, then $\\mu=1$. If $\\alpha=-2$, then $\\mu=-1$. An eigenvalue of magnitude 1 with multiplicity greater than one can lead to instability if the matrix $M$ is not diagonalizable. In such a scenario (a non-trivial Jordan block), solutions can grow linearly with time (e.g., of the form $t \\cdot p(t)$ where $p(t)$ is periodic), causing instability. This situation, known as parametric resonance, is a possibility at the boundary of the stability region. Thus, without further information guaranteeing that $M$ is diagonalizable (e.g., $M = \\pm I$), the system at $|\\alpha|=2$ is generally considered unstable.\n\nIn summary, the trap is stable if and only if $|\\alpha| < 2$.
