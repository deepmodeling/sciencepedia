The dynamics are considered on the torus, meaning a coordinate value of $1.2$ is equivalent to $0.2$, and a value of $-0.3$ is equivalent to $0.7$.\n\nConsider a cross-section $\\Sigma$ defined as the vertical line segment where the $x$-coordinate is zero: $\\Sigma = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{T}^2 \\mid x=0\\}$.
