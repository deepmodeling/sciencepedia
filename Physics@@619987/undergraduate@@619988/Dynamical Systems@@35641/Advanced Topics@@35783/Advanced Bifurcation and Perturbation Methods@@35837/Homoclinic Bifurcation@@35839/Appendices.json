The uniqueness theorem for solutions of ODEs prevents any trajectory from crossing itself, and a homoclinic orbit must necessarily start and end at the origin, which constitutes a crossing.\n\nB. For a homoclinic orbit to exist, the trajectory must belong to both the stable and unstable manifolds of the origin. In this linear system, these manifolds are distinct straight lines, and a single non-trivial trajectory cannot lie on both.\n\nC. A homoclinic orbit can only exist if the system is non-hyperbolic, which requires the matrix $A$ to have at least one eigenvalue with a real part of zero.
