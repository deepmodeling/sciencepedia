Analysis of the model's governing equations reveals an equilibrium point which is classified as a saddle-focus. For such an equilibrium, the dynamics are characterized by expansion along one direction and spiraling contraction in a plane.

The stability of an equilibrium point is determined by the sign of the real part of its eigenvalues. An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ corresponds to a stable direction if its real part is negative ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda) < 0$) and an unstable direction if its real part is positive ($\\text{Re}(\\lambda) > 0$).\n\nLet's examine the real parts of the given eigenvalues:\n- For $\\lambda_1 = 0.75$, the real part is $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) = 0.75$. Since $0.75 > 0$, this is the unstable eigenvalue.\n- For $\\lambda_2 = -0.4 + 2.1i$, the real part is $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_2) = -0.4$. Since $-0.4 < 0$, this is a stable eigenvalue.\n- For $\\lambda_3 = -0.4 - 2.1i$, the real part is $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_3) = -0.4$. Since $-0.4 < 0$, this is also a stable eigenvalue.\n\nThe presence of one real positive eigenvalue and a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues with negative real parts confirms that the equilibrium is indeed a saddle-focus.\n\nThe problem defines the saddle index as the ratio of the magnitude of the real part of the stable eigenvalues to the value of the unstable eigenvalue.\nLet's denote the unstable eigenvalue as $\\gamma$ and the real part of the stable complex conjugate eigenvalues as $\\sigma$.\nFrom our analysis:\n- The unstable eigenvalue is $\\gamma = \\lambda_1 = 0.75$.\n- The real part of the stable eigenvalues is $\\sigma = \\text{Re}(\\lambda_2) = \\text{Re}(\\lambda_3) = -0.4$.\n\nThe magnitude of the real part of the stable eigenvalues is $|\\sigma| = |-0.4| = 0.4$.\n\nNow, we can calculate the saddle index, which we will denote as $\\delta$.\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{|\\sigma|}{\\gamma}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{0.4}{0.75}\n$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can write it as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{4/10}{75/100} = \\frac{4}{10} \\times \\frac{100}{75} = \\frac{40}{75}\n$$\nDividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{40 \\div 5}{75 \\div 5} = \\frac{8}{15}\n$$\nTo get a numerical answer, we perform the division:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{8}{15} \\approx 0.533333...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are 5, 3, and 3. The fourth digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the last significant digit).\nTherefore, the saddle index is $0.533$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.533}$$", "id": "1706632"}, {"introduction": "With the ability to characterize a saddle-focus, we can now address the central question: under what conditions does a homoclinic orbit to this point generate chaos?

The system's state is described by three variables in a three-dimensional state space, and its evolution is controlled by a single parameter, $\\mu$. For all relevant values of $\\mu$, the system has a fixed point at the origin, $P_0 = (0,0,0)$.\n\nA stability analysis of the fixed point $P_0$ is performed by linearizing the system's equations. The eigenvalues of the resulting Jacobian matrix are found to be one real, positive eigenvalue, $\\gamma$, and a complex conjugate pair, $\\sigma \\pm i\\omega$, where $\\sigma$ is a negative real number and $\\omega$ is a positive real number. Thus, $P_0$ is a saddle-focus fixed point.\n\nBy tuning the control parameter $\\mu$, the physicists observe the following phenomenon: As $\\mu$ is increased towards a critical value $\\mu_c$, a stable periodic orbit (a limit cycle) in the state space grows in size. At precisely $\\mu = \\mu_c$, this limit cycle collides with the fixed point $P_0$, creating a single trajectory known as a homoclinic orbit. This special trajectory emanates from $P_0$ along its unstable direction and eventually returns to $P_0$ along its stable spiraling direction.\n\nAccording to the Shilnikov theorem, the existence of such a homoclinic orbit can lead to chaotic behavior for parameter values near $\\mu_c$. The onset of this chaos depends on the relative rates of expansion and contraction near the fixed point, which are determined by the eigenvalues.\n\nWhich of the following conditions on the eigenvalues $\\gamma$ and $\\sigma$ correctly identifies the criterion for the system to exhibit chaotic dynamics in the vicinity of this homoclinic bifurcation?\n\nA.
