The fixed points, denoted by $r^*$, are the values of $r$ for which $\\dot{r}=0$.\n\nFirst, we find the fixed points by setting the radial equation to zero:\n$$\n\\mu - \\alpha(r^*-r_0)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(r^*-r_0)^2 = \\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}\n$$\nWe analyze the solutions to this equation for different ranges of the parameter $\\mu$.\n\nCase 1: $\\mu < 0$.\nSince $\\alpha$ is a positive constant, the right-hand side $\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}$ is negative. The square of a real number, $(r^*-r_0)^2$, cannot be negative. Therefore, there are no real solutions for $r^*$ in this case. This implies that for $\\mu < 0$, the system has no limit cycles.\n\nCase 2: $\\mu = 0$.\nThe equation becomes $(r^*-r_0)^2 = 0$, which has a single solution $r^* = r_0$. Since $r_0$ is a positive constant, this corresponds to a single limit cycle of radius $r_0$. This is the bifurcation point.\n\nCase 3: $\\mu > 0$.\nThe right-hand side $\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}$ is positive. Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$\nr^* - r_0 = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}}\n$$\nThis yields two distinct fixed points:\n$$\nr^*_1 = r_0 - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r^*_2 = r_0 + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}}\n$$\nSince $r$ represents a physical amplitude, we must have $r \\ge 0$. As we are interested in the behavior near the bifurcation point $\\mu=0$, we consider small positive values of $\\mu$. For $\\mu$ sufficiently small such that $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}} < r_0$, both $r^*_1$ and $r^*_2$ are positive. Thus, for $\\mu > 0$, there are two limit cycles.\n\nNext, we determine the stability of these fixed points. The stability is determined by the sign of the derivative of the function $f(r) = \\mu - \\alpha(r-r_0)^2$ evaluated at the fixed point. A fixed point $r^*$ is stable if $f'(r^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(r^*) > 0$.\nThe derivative is:\n$$\nf'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\mu - \\alpha(r-r_0)^2 \\right) = -2\\alpha(r-r_0)\n$$\nWe now evaluate this derivative at the fixed points for the case $\\mu > 0$.\n\nFor the fixed point $r^*_1 = r_0 - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}}$:\n$$\nf'(r^*_1) = -2\\alpha(r^*_1 - r_0) = -2\\alpha \\left( \\left(r_0 - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}}\\right) - r_0 \\right) = -2\\alpha \\left( -\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}} \\right) = 2\\sqrt{\\mu\\alpha}\n$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$, $f'(r^*_1)$ is positive. Therefore, the limit cycle at radius $r^*_1$ is unstable.\n\nFor the fixed point $r^*_2 = r_0 + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}}$:\n$$\nf'(r^*_2) = -2\\alpha(r^*_2 - r_0) = -2\\alpha \\left( \\left(r_0 + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}}\\right) - r_0 \\right) = -2\\alpha \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{\\alpha}} \\right) = -2\\sqrt{\\mu\\alpha}\n$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$, $f'(r^*_2)$ is negative. Therefore, the limit cycle at radius $r^*_2$ is stable.\n\nIn summary:\n- For $\\mu < 0$, there are no limit cycles.\n- At $\\mu = 0$, a single limit cycle appears at $r = r_0$.\n- For $\\mu > 0$, this splits into two limit cycles: one unstable and one stable.\n\nThis behavior, where a pair of fixed points (one stable, one unstable) are created at a bifurcation point and exist only on one side of it, is characteristic of a saddle-node bifurcation. As $\\mu$ passes from positive to negative, the stable and unstable limit cycles approach each other, merge at $\\mu=0$, and then disappear. This is often described as the cycles merging and annihilating.\n\nComparing this conclusion with the given options:\n- A is incorrect because for $\\mu > 0$, there is also an unstable cycle.\n- B is incorrect as it reverses the conditions for $\\mu$.\n- C correctly states that for $\\mu > 0$, there is one stable and one unstable limit cycle, and that at $\\mu=0$, they merge and annihilate (since they do not exist for $\\mu < 0$).\n- D is incorrect about the behavior for $\\mu < 0$.\n- E is incorrect about the behavior for both $\\mu > 0$ and $\\mu < 0$.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is given in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1704943"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical knowledge gains its power when it can interpret real-world observations.

For each circuit, the output voltage is characterized by a state variable $x(t)$. The physicist can tune a dimensionless control parameter $\\mu$, which is proportional to an applied DC voltage. Both circuits are initially in a quiescent state, corresponding to a stable equilibrium point (constant output voltage) for low values of $\\mu$. As $\\mu$ is slowly increased, both circuits eventually transition to a state of sustained periodic oscillation at a critical parameter value, $\\mu_c$. However, the qualitative nature of the transition, as observed from the time series of $x(t)$, is markedly different for the two circuits.\n\n**Observations for Circuit A:**\nThe transition to oscillation is smooth. For values of $\\mu$ just above $\\mu_c$, the amplitude of the stable, sinusoidal oscillations is found to be very small, growing from zero according to the relationship $A \\propto \\sqrt{\\mu - \\mu_c}$. Furthermore, when the system is set to a parameter value $\\mu$ just below $\\mu_c$ and given a small electrical pulse, the voltage $x(t)$ returns to its stable equilibrium value via damped oscillations. The time it takes for these damped oscillations to decay away becomes progressively longer as $\\mu$ approaches $\\mu_c$ from below.\n\n**Observations for Circuit B:**\nThe transition to oscillation is abrupt. For values of $\\mu$ just above $\\mu_c$, the system exhibits bistability: it can either remain at the stable equilibrium point, or, if perturbed by a sufficiently large electrical pulse, it will jump to a state of large-amplitude, stable oscillation. The amplitude of these oscillations is significantly greater than zero right at their onset. Most distinctively, when the parameter is set to a value $\\mu$ just *below* $\\mu_c$, the system, if perturbed, displays a behavior known as intermittency: the voltage $x(t)$ shows long bursts of nearly periodic oscillations, which are irregularly interrupted by a collapse back to the equilibrium state for a short period before another oscillatory burst begins. The average duration of the oscillatory bursts increases significantly as $\\mu$ gets closer to $\\mu_c$ from below.\n\nBased on these experimental observations, identify the type of bifurcation that best describes the transition to oscillation in each circuit.\n\nA.

For $\\mu < \\mu_{c}$, the equilibrium is a stable focus with eigenvalues $-\\sigma \\pm i \\omega_{0}$ where $\\sigma = -\\lambda(\\mu) > 0$, hence perturbations decay via damped oscillations. As $\\mu \\to \\mu_{c}^{-}$, $\\sigma \\to 0^{+}$ and the decay time $\\tau \\sim \\sigma^{-1}$ diverges, which explains the progressively longer decay times. These are the defining signatures of a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. Therefore Circuit A is supercritical Hopf.\n\nFor Circuit B, the observations are:\n- The onset is abrupt, with a finite, nonzero oscillation amplitude at birth.\n- For $\\mu$ just above $\\mu_{c}$ there is bistability between the equilibrium and a large-amplitude stable oscillation; a sufficiently large perturbation can trigger the oscillation.\n- For $\\mu$ just below $\\mu_{c}$, there is intermittency (bursts of nearly periodic oscillations separated by returns to equilibrium), and the average burst duration grows as $\\mu \\to \\mu_{c}^{-}$.\n\nAn abrupt onset with finite amplitude and bistability (coexistence of an equilibrium and a stable limit cycle) is characteristic of a saddle-node (fold) bifurcation of limit cycles. In a Poincaré return map for the oscillation amplitude $r$, a saddle-node (tangent) bifurcation has the canonical form\n$$\nr_{n+1} - r_{n} = a (\\mu - \\mu_{c}) + b r_{n}^{2} + \\text{higher-order terms},\n$$\nwhich creates or annihilates a pair of cycles (one stable, one unstable) at finite amplitude. On the side where both the equilibrium and the stable cycle exist, an unstable cycle separates their basins, producing bistability and requiring a finite perturbation to transition. Just below $\\mu_{c}$, no periodic orbit exists but the dynamics shadow the “ghost” of the annihilated cycles, producing type-I intermittency with long laminar (nearly periodic) episodes whose average duration diverges as $\\mu \\to \\mu_{c}^{-}$ (typically with a scaling of the form $\\langle T \\rangle \\propto (\\mu_{c} - \\mu)^{-1/2}$ in the canonical case). These features match the observations for Circuit B. A subcritical Hopf would render the equilibrium unstable just above $\\mu_{c}$, contradicting the stated bistability with a stable equilibrium for $\\mu$ just above $\\mu_{c}$. Pitchfork or transcritical bifurcations concern equilibria, not the birth of limit cycles.\n\nTherefore, Circuit B is best described by a saddle-node bifurcation of cycles.\n\nCombining the two identifications yields option A: Circuit A is a supercritical Hopf bifurcation; Circuit B is a saddle-node bifurcation of cycles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1704950"}, {"introduction": "While simple models are great for building intuition, most real-world systems are too complex for pen-and-paper analysis.

This bifurcation occurs when a stable limit cycle and an unstable limit cycle merge and annihilate.
