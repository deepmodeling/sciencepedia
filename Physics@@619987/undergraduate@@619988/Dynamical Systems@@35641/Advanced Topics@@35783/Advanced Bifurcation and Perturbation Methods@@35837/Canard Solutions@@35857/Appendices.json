Theory predicts that these canard solutions exist only for parameter values of $a$ within an exponentially narrow range, i.e., $a \\in [a_c - \\Delta, a_c)$, where the width $\\Delta$ is proportional to $\\exp(-C/\\epsilon)$ for some positive constant $C$.

Which of the following numerical procedures is the most direct and effective method for experimentally locating a value of the parameter $a$ that produces a canard trajectory?\n\nA. Start with a parameter value $a \\gg a_c$ (in the steady-state regime) and decrease $a$ in large, discrete steps (e.g., of size $0.1$). Integrate the system for a long duration at each step. The first value of $a$ for which the trajectory converges to a limit cycle instead of a fixed point will correspond to a canard.\n\nB. Choose a value of $a \\ll a_c$ that produces a large, stable relaxation oscillation. Select an arbitrary point on this limit cycle and integrate the system backwards in time. The resulting trajectory will trace the path of a canard in reverse.\n\nC. Using knowledge of the function $f(x,y,a)$, analytically identify a point $(x_0, y_0)$ on the unstable branch of the critical manifold. Start a numerical simulation from this initial condition with $a$ set to $a_c$. If the trajectory remains near the unstable manifold, it is a canard.\n\nD. Begin with a parameter value $a$ just slightly greater than $a_c$. Systematically decrease $a$ in extremely small increments. For each value of $a$, integrate the system from a consistent initial condition and measure the amplitude of the resulting long-term behavior (either a fixed point or a limit cycle). A canard trajectory will be found within the narrow parameter range where the measured amplitude undergoes a sudden and very large increase.\n\nE. Fix the parameter $a$ at the critical value $a_c$.

For $a>a_{c}$ there is a globally stable fixed point; for $a<a_{c}$ the fixed point is unstable and a stable limit cycle exists. In slow-fast systems, a canard trajectory appears for $a$ just below $a_{c}$ and follows the repelling branch of the critical manifold $f(x,y,a_{c})=0$ for an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ amount of time before being repelled.

Decreasing $a$ in large steps (e.g., of size $0.1$) from $a\\gg a_{c}$ cannot resolve a window of width $\\Delta \\sim \\exp(-C/\\epsilon)$, which is exponentially small in $\\epsilon$. This procedure will almost certainly jump from convergence to a fixed point directly to a large-amplitude relaxation oscillation, skipping the exponentially narrow canard window. Hence it is ineffective.\n\nB. Integrating backwards in time from a large-amplitude relaxation oscillation at $a\\ll a_{c}$ is numerically ill-posed for dissipative systems; backward integration amplifies numerical errors and does not reliably trace specific unstable structures. Moreover, this does not directly identify the value of $a$ producing a canard near $a_{c}$. Hence it is not a practical method.\n\nC. This requires analytic knowledge of $f$ to identify a point on the unstable branch of the critical manifold, which contradicts the premise that the engineer does not know the analytical forms of $f$ and $g$. It is not applicable.\n\nD. Starting with $a$ just above $a_{c}$ and decreasing $a$ in extremely small increments directly targets the exponentially small window. For each $a$, integrate from a consistent initial condition long enough to determine the asymptotic behavior and measure an amplitude $A(a)$ of the long-term state (zero for a fixed point; positive for a limit cycle). In a supercritical Hopf with canard explosion, $A(a)$ undergoes a sudden and very large increase across the exponentially narrow interval $[a_{c}-\\Delta,a_{c})$. Hence, scanning $a$ with extremely fine resolution and tracking $A(a)$ is the most direct way to locate $a$ that yields a canard.\n\nE. At $a=a_{c}$, there is no canard limit cycle; random initial conditions merely produce critical slowing down in convergence to the fixed point. The longest transient at $a_{c}$ is not a canard, and this does not identify the parameter values producing canard trajectories.\n\nTherefore, the only procedure that is both applicable under the given constraints and directly exploits the defining numerical signature of canard explosion (an abrupt, large amplitude jump over a window of width $\\Delta \\sim \\exp(-C/\\epsilon)$) is option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1666183"}]}
