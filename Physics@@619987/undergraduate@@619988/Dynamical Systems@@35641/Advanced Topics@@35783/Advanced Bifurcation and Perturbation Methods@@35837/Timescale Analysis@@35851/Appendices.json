The temperature of the heating element relative to an ambient baseline is given by $x(t)$, and the relative temperature of the bulk material is given by $y(t)$. The system's dynamics are described by a pair of coupled linear differential equations.\n\nThe temperature of the heating element, $x(t)$, responds quickly to changes and is governed by its thermal interaction with the bulk material:\n$$m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + b \\frac{dx}{dt} + k(x - y) = 0$$\nHere, $m$ is the effective thermal inertia, $b$ is a thermal dissipation coefficient, and $k$ is the thermal conductivity between the element and the bulk material. All these constants are positive.\n\nThe temperature of the bulk material, $y(t)$, changes very slowly. Its evolution is determined by a control law that depends on its own temperature and the temperature of the heating element:\n$$\\tau \\frac{dy}{dt} = -y - \\beta x$$\nHere, $\\tau$ is a large time constant representing the high thermal mass of the bulk material, and $\\beta$ is a positive, dimensionless feedback gain.\n\nAssume that the system operates in a regime where the dynamics of the heating element $x(t)$ are extremely fast compared to the dynamics of the bulk material $y(t)$. This allows the element's temperature to rapidly reach a quasi-steady state for any given temperature of the bulk material. After an initial, brief transient period, the system settles into a slow evolution governed by the dynamics of $y(t)$.\n\nDetermine the characteristic time constant that describes the slow decay of the bulk material's temperature, $y(t)$, during this long-term evolution.

After the initial fast transient, $x(t)$ reaches a quasi-steady state for the slowly varying $y(t)$. In the quasi-steady approximation, the time-derivative terms of the fast subsystem are negligible compared to the coupling term, so we set\n$$m \\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} \\approx 0, \\qquad b \\frac{dx}{dt} \\approx 0.$$\nThe fast equation reduces to the algebraic constraint\n$$k(x - y) \\approx 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad x \\approx y.$$\n\nThis defines the slow manifold.
