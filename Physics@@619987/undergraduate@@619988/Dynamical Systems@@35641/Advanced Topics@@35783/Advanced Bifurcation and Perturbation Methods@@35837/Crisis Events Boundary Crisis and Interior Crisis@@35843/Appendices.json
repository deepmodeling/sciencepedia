This exercise provides a foundational, hands-on calculation of the precise moment an attractor is destroyed. By working through the algebraic conditions for the quadratic map, you will see how a chaotic system's stable behavior can abruptly vanish as it collides with an unstable fixed point that guards the edge of its basin of attraction [@problem_id:1670691]. This practice is essential for building a concrete, analytical grasp of this fundamental instability.", "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional dynamical system described by the quadratic map $f_a(x) = 1 - ax^2$, which maps the interval $I=[-1, 1]$ to itself for a certain range of the real parameter $a > 0$. For values of $a$ following a period-doubling bifurcation at $a=3/4$, the system possesses a complex attractor (which may be a stable periodic orbit or a chaotic band) confined within a specific subinterval of $I$.\n\nThe long-term behavior of any initial point $x_0$ depends on whether it lies within the basin of attraction of this attractor. The boundary of this basin is determined by an unstable fixed point of the map. A \"boundary crisis\" occurs at a critical parameter value $a_c$, where the attractor collides with this unstable fixed point. This collision results in the sudden destruction of the attractor, as trajectories can then escape to negative infinity.\n\nThe edge of the attractor can be located by tracking the evolution of the map's critical point (the point where the derivative is zero). Specifically, the crisis occurs when an iterate of the critical point collides with the relevant unstable fixed point. For this map, the crisis happens when the second iterate of the critical point, $f_a^2(0)$, coincides with the unstable fixed point that bounds the basin.\n\nDetermine the exact critical value of the parameter, $a_c$, at which this boundary crisis occurs.", "solution": "The problem asks for the critical parameter value $a_c$ at which a boundary crisis occurs for the map $f_a(x) = 1 - ax^2$. The crisis is described as the collision of the attractor with an unstable fixed point that acts as a basin boundary.\n\n**Step 1: Find the fixed points of the map.**\nA fixed point $x^*$ satisfies the equation $f_a(x^*) = x^*$.\n$$x = 1 - ax^2$$\n$$ax^2 + x - 1 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula to solve for $x$, we find the two fixed points:\n$$x^* = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(a)(-1)}}{2a} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+4a}}{2a}$$\nLet's denote these two fixed points as:\n$$x_+^* = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1+4a}}{2a}$$\n$$x_-^* = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{1+4a}}{2a}$$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of the fixed points and identify the unstable basin boundary.**\nThe stability of a fixed point $x^*$ is determined by the magnitude of the derivative of the map at that point, $|f_a'(x^*)|$. The derivative of the map is:\n$$f_a'(x) = -2ax$$\nThe problem states that an attractor is born from a period-doubling bifurcation. This attractor's basin is bounded by an unstable fixed point. Let's analyze the stability of both $x_+^*$ and $x_-^*$.\n\nFor $x_+^*$:\n$$f_a'(x_+^*) = -2a \\left( \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1+4a}}{2a} \\right) = 1 - \\sqrt{1+4a}$$\nFor this fixed point to be stable, we need $|1 - \\sqrt{1+4a}| < 1$. Since $a>0$, $\\sqrt{1+4a} > 1$, so $1 - \\sqrt{1+4a}$ is negative. The condition becomes:\n$$-(1 - \\sqrt{1+4a}) < 1 \\implies \\sqrt{1+4a} - 1 < 1 \\implies \\sqrt{1+4a} < 2$$\n$$1+4a < 4 \\implies 4a < 3 \\implies a < 3/4$$\nFor $a > 3/4$, this fixed point is unstable. It is from this point that a period-doubling cascade begins, giving rise to the attractor mentioned in the problem.\n\nFor $x_-^*$:\n$$f_a'(x_-^*) = -2a \\left( \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{1+4a}}{2a} \\right) = 1 + \\sqrt{1+4a}$$\nSince $a>0$, $\\sqrt{1+4a} > 1$, which implies $f_a'(x_-^*) > 2$. Therefore, $|f_a'(x_-^*)| > 1$ for all $a>0$. This means $x_-^*$ is always an unstable fixed point. It is this unstable fixed point that forms the boundary of the basin of attraction for the main attractor.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the location of the attractor's edge.**\nThe problem states that the edge of the attractor can be found by tracking the iterates of the critical point. The critical point $x_c$ is where $f_a'(x_c) = 0$.\n$$-2ax_c = 0 \\implies x_c = 0$$\nThe problem specifies that the crisis occurs when the second iterate of the critical point, $f_a^2(0)$, collides with the unstable fixed point. Let's compute $f_a^2(0)$.\nFirst iterate:\n$$f_a(0) = 1 - a(0)^2 = 1$$\nSecond iterate:\n$$f_a^2(0) = f_a(f_a(0)) = f_a(1) = 1 - a(1)^2 = 1-a$$\nSo, the relevant edge of the attractor is located at $y = 1-a$.\n\n**Step 4: Set up and solve the crisis condition.**\nThe boundary crisis occurs at $a=a_c$ when the edge of the attractor, $1-a$, collides with the unstable fixed point, $x_-^*$.\n$$1 - a_c = x_-^* = \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{1+4a_c}}{2a_c}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $a_c$. We assume $a_c \\neq 0$.\n$$2a_c(1 - a_c) = -1 - \\sqrt{1+4a_c}$$\n$$2a_c - 2a_c^2 = -1 - \\sqrt{1+4a_c}$$\nIsolate the square root term:\n$$\\sqrt{1+4a_c} = 2a_c^2 - 2a_c - 1$$\nBefore squaring, we should note that the left-hand side is positive, so we require the right-hand side to be positive as well. Let's proceed and check this condition later. Squaring both sides gives:\n$$1+4a_c = (2a_c^2 - 2a_c - 1)^2$$\n$$1+4a_c = 4a_c^4 - 8a_c^3 + 4a_c^2 - 4a_c^2 + 4a_c + 1$$\n$$1+4a_c = 4a_c^4 - 8a_c^3 + 4a_c + 1$$\nSubtracting $(4a_c+1)$ from both sides:\n$$0 = 4a_c^4 - 8a_c^3$$\n$$0 = 4a_c^3(a_c - 2)$$\nSince the problem specifies $a > 0$, we must have $a_c \\neq 0$. The only non-trivial solution is:\n$$a_c = 2$$\nFinally, we must verify the condition $2a_c^2 - 2a_c - 1 > 0$ for our solution $a_c=2$.\n$$2(2)^2 - 2(2) - 1 = 2(4) - 4 - 1 = 8 - 4 - 1 = 3$$\nSince $3 > 0$, the condition is satisfied. Thus, the critical value for the boundary crisis is $a_c=2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1670691"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of a boundary crisis, we now explore its counterpart: the interior crisis. Rather than an attractor's destruction, an interior crisis involves the sudden merging of two or more separate attractors into a single, larger one.
