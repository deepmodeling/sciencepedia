Experimental data from yeast two-hybrid screens have identified a set of physical interactions between these proteins. The interactions are considered undirected, meaning an interaction between protein A and protein B is a single connection shared by both. The complete list of observed interactions is as follows:\n\nP1 interacts with P2\nP1 interacts with P3\nP1 interacts with P4\nP2 interacts with P5\nP3 interacts with P4\nP3 interacts with P6\nP4 interacts with P7\nP5 interacts with P6\nP6 interacts with P7\n\nIn network analysis, a fundamental property is the degree of a node, which is the number of connections it has. To characterize the network's heterogeneity, we can compare the most connected node (the hub) to the average connectivity.

This exercise guides you through a step-by-step simulation of the famous Barabási-Albert model, where new nodes are more likely to connect to already well-connected nodes. By tracing this process manually, you will gain firsthand insight into how a few nodes naturally become highly-connected hubs, giving rise to the network's characteristic structure [@problem_id:1705409].", "problem": "Consider the growth of a small network according to the Barabási-Albert (BA) model. The BA model is a procedure for generating random scale-free networks using a \"preferential attachment\" mechanism. The process starts with an initial network of nodes. At each time step, a new node is added, and it forms a fixed number of links, $m$, to the existing nodes. The probability, $\\Pi_i$, that the new node will connect to an existing node $i$ is proportional to the degree $k_i$ of that node. Specifically, the probability is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\Pi_i = \\frac{k_i}{\\sum_j k_j}\n$$\nwhere the sum in the denominator is over all pre-existing nodes $j$.\n\nThe process begins at time $t=0$ with an initial network consisting of a complete graph with 3 nodes, which we can label as Node 1, Node 2, and Node 3. In a complete graph, every node is connected to every other node.\n\nAt time $t=1$, a new node, Node 4, is added to the network. It forms $m=1$ link to one of the existing nodes (1, 2, or 3) according to the preferential attachment rule.\n\nAt time $t=2$, a second new node, Node 5, is added. It also forms $m=1$ link to one of the four nodes present in the network at that time, again following the preferential attachment rule.\n\nThe degree sequence of a graph is the list of its node degrees, typically arranged in non-increasing order.

Then the degrees become: $k_{i}=3$, the other two initial nodes have degrees $2$, and $k_{4}=1$. The sum of degrees is now $8$ (adding one edge increases the total degree by $2$).\n\nAt $t=2$, Node $5$ is added and connects to one of the four existing nodes with probabilities proportional to their degrees. Thus the probabilities are:\n- to the degree-$3$ node: $\\frac{3}{8}$,\n- to each degree-$2$ node: $\\frac{2}{8}$,\n- to Node $4$ (degree $1$): $\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nWe require the final degree sequence to be $(4,2,2,1,1)$. This occurs if and only if Node $5$ connects to the same initial node that already has degree $3$ (raising it to degree $4$), yielding degrees $[4,2,2,1,1]$ after including Node $5$’s degree $1$. Any other choice produces a different sequence:\n- attaching to a degree-$2$ node gives $[3,3,2,1,1]$,\n- attaching to Node $4$ gives $[3,2,2,2,1]$.\n\nTherefore, conditional on which initial node received Node $4$’s link, the probability of achieving $(4,2,2,1,1)$ is $\\frac{3}{8}$.
