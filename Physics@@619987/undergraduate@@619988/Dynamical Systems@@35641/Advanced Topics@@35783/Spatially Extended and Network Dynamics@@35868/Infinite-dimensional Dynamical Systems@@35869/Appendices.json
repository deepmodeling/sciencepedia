One of its physical interpretations is as a model for a continuous line of pendulums coupled by torsion springs. In this context, the equation is given by\n$$ u_{tt} - c^2 u_{xx} + \\omega_0^2 \\sin(u) = 0 $$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ represents the angular displacement (in radians) of the pendulum at position $x$ and time $t$. The constants $c$ and $\\omega_0$ represent the wave propagation speed and the natural frequency of a single pendulum, respectively.\n\nFor simplicity, let's consider the normalized version of the equation where $c=1$ and $\\omega_0=1$:\n$$ u_{tt} - u_{xx} + \\sin(u) = 0 $$\n\nWe are interested in \"spatially uniform\" solutions, which are solutions that do not depend on the spatial variable $x$, i.e., they have the form $u(x,t) = v(t)$.\n\n(a) Find the general form for all possible constant values $C$ such that the function $u(x,t) = C$ is a stationary, spatially uniform solution.

For such solutions, the function $u$ does not depend on the spatial variable $x$. Consequently, all partial derivatives with respect to $x$ are zero. In particular, the term $u_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ is zero.\n\nSubstituting $u(x,t) = v(t)$ and $u_{xx}=0$ into the sine-Gordon equation, it simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $v(t)$:\n$$ v_{tt} + \\sin(v) = 0 $$\nwhere $v_{tt} = \\frac{d^2 v}{dt^2}$. This is the well-known equation for a simple nonlinear pendulum.\n\n**(a) Constant Equilibrium Solutions**\n\nFor part (a), we are seeking constant solutions of the form $u(x,t) = v(t) = C$, where $C$ is a constant. If $v(t) = C$, then its second time derivative is $v_{tt} = 0$. Substituting this into the ODE gives:\n$$ 0 + \\sin(C) = 0 $$\nThe solutions to $\\sin(C) = 0$ occur when $C$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$.

This equation describes a conservative system. We can find a conserved quantity (an \"energy\" integral) by multiplying the equation by $v_t = \\frac{dv}{dt}$:\n$$ v_t v_{tt} + v_t \\sin(v) = 0 $$\nWe can recognize each term as a derivative with respect to time:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}v_t^2\\right) + \\frac{d}{dt}(-\\cos(v)) = 0 $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}v_t^2 - \\cos(v) \\right) = 0 $$\nThis implies that the quantity inside the parenthesis is a constant of motion, let's call it $E$:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2}v_t^2 - \\cos(v) $$\nWe are given the initial conditions $v(0) = A$ and $v_t(0) = 0$. We use these to evaluate the constant $E$:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 - \\cos(A) = -\\cos(A) $$\nSo, for this specific solution, the conservation law is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}v_t^2 - \\cos(v) = -\\cos(A) $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $v_t^2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}v_t^2 = \\cos(v) - \\cos(A) $$\n$$ v_t^2 = 2(\\cos(v) - \\cos(A)) $$\nThe magnitude of the temporal rate of change, or speed, is $|v_t| = \\sqrt{2(\\cos(v) - \\cos(A))}$. We want to find the maximum value of this speed, $|v_t|_{\\max}$. This will occur when the term inside the square root is maximized. Since $A$ is a fixed constant, we need to maximize $\\cos(v)$.\n\nThe range of motion for $v$ is bounded by the points where $v_t=0$, which occurs when $\\cos(v) = \\cos(A)$. Since we are given $0 < A < \\pi$, the solution $v(t)$ will oscillate between $-A$ and $A$. The maximum value of $\\cos(v)$ for $v \\in [-A, A]$ occurs at $v=0$, where $\\cos(0) = 1$.\n\nSubstituting $v=0$ into the expression for $v_t^2$ gives the maximum squared speed:\n$$ |v_t|_{\\max}^2 = 2(\\cos(0) - \\cos(A)) = 2(1 - \\cos(A)) $$\nNow, we find the maximum speed by taking the square root:\n$$ |v_t|_{\\max} = \\sqrt{2(1 - \\cos(A))} $$\nThis expression can be simplified using the trigonometric half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(A) = 2\\sin^2(A/2)$.\n$$ |v_t|_{\\max} = \\sqrt{2 \\left(2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right)\\right)} = \\sqrt{4\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right)} = \\left|2\\sin\\left(\\frac{A}{2}\\right)\\right| $$\nSince we are given $0 < A < \\pi$, it follows that $0 < A/2 < \\pi/2$. In this interval, $\\sin(A/2)$ is positive.
