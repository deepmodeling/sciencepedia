A common model is the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (Fisher-KPP) equation, which describes the evolution of the population density $u(x,t)$ at position $x$ and time $t$.

The partial differential equation thus reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the steady-state concentration profile $u(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u}{d x^2} - u = -S\n$$\nThis is a second-order, linear, non-homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.\n\nFirst, we solve the homogeneous equation $u_h'' - u_h = 0$. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - 1 = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm 1$. The homogeneous solution is therefore $u_h(x) = C_1 e^x + C_2 e^{-x}$, which can be more conveniently written in terms of hyperbolic functions as $u_h(x) = A \\cosh(x) + B \\sinh(x)$.\n\nNext, we find a particular solution $u_p(x)$ for the non-homogeneous equation $u'' - u = -S$.
