Before tackling complex population-level dynamics, it is crucial to understand the probabilistic nature of transmission on a simple, well-defined structure. This exercise challenges you to calculate the infection probability for a specific node by considering all possible transmission routes from a source, reinforcing concepts from probability theory in a tangible, network context.

In this model, nodes can be in one of two states: Susceptible (S) or Infected (I). The process starts with a single source node being in the Infected state, while all other nodes are Susceptible.\n\nThe infection spreads along the directed edges of the network. For each directed edge $(u, v)$ from an infected node $u$ to a susceptible node $v$, a transmission event occurs with a fixed probability $p$. All transmission events are independent. If a transmission event occurs, node $v$ becomes infected. Once a node is infected, it remains infected for the duration of the process.\n\nConsider a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the set of nodes $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ and the set of edges $E = \\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (1, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6)\\}$.

This concept is formalized as the epidemic threshold, a critical value that is intimately linked to the structure of the contact network. This practice explores how a minor change in network topology—in this case, connecting the ends of a line to form a loop—can significantly alter the conditions for a large-scale outbreak. By calculating the threshold for both a path and a cycle graph, you will discover the crucial role that a network's spectral properties play in governing epidemic dynamics.

The transmission of the virus is well-described by a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model, where individuals who recover from the infection immediately become susceptible again. In this model, an infected individual transmits the disease to each of their susceptible neighbors at a rate $\\beta$, and recovers at a rate $\\gamma$. The dynamics of the spread are critically dependent on the network structure of social contacts within the community.\n\nCommunity A is a linear settlement, where houses are arranged in a single line. An individual in house $i$ (for $1 < i < N$) has social contact only with their immediate neighbors in houses $i-1$ and $i+1$. The individuals at the ends of the line (in houses 1 and $N$) only have one neighbor each. This structure forms a path graph.\n\nCommunity B is a circular settlement, where houses are arranged around a central common area. Every individual has social contact with exactly two neighbors, forming a closed loop. This structure forms a cycle graph.\n\nAn epidemic is said to occur if the number of infected individuals can grow from a small initial seed. This happens when the effective spreading rate, defined as $\\lambda = \\beta / \\gamma$, exceeds a critical value known as the epidemic threshold, $\\lambda_c$.
