This dynamic can be described by a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model.\n\nThe process of infection and recovery is governed by the following rules:\n- A compromised server can infect a healthy server it is connected to. The per-contact infection rate is a constant, $\\beta$.\n- A compromised server can be automatically cleaned and returned to a healthy state.
