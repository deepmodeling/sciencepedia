Since each vacancy costs an energy $\\epsilon$ and they are non-interacting, the total energy is:\n$$E(n) = n\\epsilon$$\n\nNext, we need to find the number of ways to create a state with $n$ vacancies. This is the degeneracy or multiplicity, $\\Omega(n)$, of the energy level $E(n)$. It corresponds to the number of ways to choose $n$ sites to be vacant out of a total of $N$ sites.
