We are interested in the thermal fluctuations of the total internal energy of the gas.\n\nWe will compare the system's behavior at two distinct temperatures. At a low temperature, $T_{low}$, the thermal energy is insufficient to excite the rotational modes, so only translational degrees of freedom contribute to the internal energy.

The formula is:\n$$(\\Delta E)^2 = \\langle E^2 \\rangle - \\langle E \\rangle^2 = k_B T^2 C_V$$\nwhere $\\langle E \\rangle$ is the average internal energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nThe RMS energy fluctuation, $\\Delta E$, is the square root of this quantity:\n$$\\Delta E = \\sqrt{k_B T^2 C_V} = T \\sqrt{k_B C_V}$$\n\nWe need to calculate the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta E_{high}}{\\Delta E_{low}}$.

The molecule is described as \"rigid\". A rigid diatomic molecule has 3 translational degrees of freedom and 2 rotational degrees of freedom (rotation about two axes perpendicular to the bond axis; rotation about the bond axis is negligible). Therefore, the total number of active degrees of freedom is $f_{high} = 3 (\\text{trans}) + 2 (\\text{rot}) = 5$.\nThe heat capacity at this temperature is:\n$$ C_{V, high} = \\frac{5}{2} N k_B $$\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for $C_V$ back into our ratio formula:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E_{high}}{\\Delta E_{low}} = \\frac{T_{high}}{T_{low}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{5}{2} N k_B}{\\frac{3}{2} N k_B}} $$\nThe term $N k_B$ and the factor of $2$ in the denominator cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta E_{high}}{\\Delta E_{low}} = \\frac{T_{high}}{T_{low}} \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{3}} $$\n\nThe problem provides the specific temperatures in terms of $\\Theta_{rot}$: $T_{low} = 0.050 \\, \\Theta_{rot}$ and $T_{high} = 20.0 \\, \\Theta_{rot}$.
