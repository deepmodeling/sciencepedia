This exercise challenges you to analyze the system's collective ground state and first excited state in the low-temperature regime. By focusing on the distinguishability of particles to determine the correct degeneracy of the system's first excited state, this practice sharpens your intuition for N-particle microstates and introduces a valuable approximation technique for low-temperature physics [@problem_id:1984035].", "problem": "Consider a system of $N$ distinguishable, non-interacting particles, which can be used as a simplified model for atoms in a crystal lattice. Each particle can occupy a discrete set of non-degenerate energy levels given by $E_n = n\\epsilon$, where $n$ is any non-negative integer ($n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$) and $\\epsilon$ is a constant positive energy representing the quantum of vibrational energy.\n\nThe system is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at a very low absolute temperature $T$, such that the thermal energy is much smaller than the first energy gap, i.e., $k_B T \\ll \\epsilon$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nIn this low-temperature regime, the partition function can be well-approximated by considering only the lowest-lying energy levels of the entire N-particle system. Find an approximate expression for the total N-particle partition function, $Z_N$, by including contributions from only the two N-particle energy levels with the lowest total energy (the ground state and the first excited state of the system). The final expression should be in terms of $N, \\epsilon, T$, and $k_B$.", "solution": "The problem asks for an approximate N-particle partition function, $Z_N$, considering only the two lowest energy levels of the entire system. The general form of the partition function is a sum over all distinct energy levels of the system, given by:\n$$Z_N = \\sum_{j} g_j \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_j}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $E_j$ is the energy of the $j$-th level of the N-particle system and $g_j$ is its degeneracy (the number of distinct microstates with that energy). Our task is to find the two lowest energies, $E_0$ and $E_1$, and their corresponding degeneracies, $g_0$ and $g_1$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the ground state energy of the system, $E_0$. The total energy of the N-particle system is the sum of the energies of the individual particles:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E_{n_i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i \\epsilon$$\nThe lowest possible total energy is achieved when all particles are in their individual ground state, which is the $n=0$ state for each particle.\n$$E_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (0 \\cdot \\epsilon) = 0$$\nThe degeneracy of this ground state, $g_0$, is the number of ways to achieve this energy. There is only one way: every particle must be in its $n=0$ state. Thus, the degeneracy is $g_0 = 1$. The contribution of the ground state to the partition function is $g_0 \\exp(-E_0 / (k_B T)) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(0) = 1$.\n\nNext, let's determine the first excited state energy of the system, $E_1$. This is the next lowest possible energy above the ground state. It is achieved by exciting a single particle from its $n=0$ state to its first excited state, $n=1$, while the other $N-1$ particles remain in the $n=0$ ground state. The total energy for such a configuration is:\n$$E_1 = (1 \\cdot \\epsilon) + (N-1) \\cdot (0 \\cdot \\epsilon) = \\epsilon$$\nNow, we must find the degeneracy of this energy level, $g_1$. Since the $N$ particles are distinguishable, any one of the $N$ particles can be the one that is excited to the $n=1$ state. For example, particle 1 could be excited, or particle 2, and so on, up to particle $N$. Each of these scenarios represents a distinct microstate of the N-particle system, and they all have the same total energy $\\epsilon$. Therefore, there are $N$ such microstates, and the degeneracy of the first excited state is $g_1 = N$. The contribution of the first excited state to the partition function is $g_1 \\exp(-E_1 / (k_B T)) = N \\exp(-\\epsilon / (k_B T))$.\n\nThe problem asks for an approximation of $Z_N$ by including only the contributions from these two lowest energy levels.\n$$Z_{N, \\text{approx}} = g_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_0}{k_B T}\\right) + g_1 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_1}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the values we found for the energies and degeneracies:\n$$Z_{N, \\text{approx}} = 1 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{k_B T}\\right) + N \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$Z_{N, \\text{approx}} = 1 + N \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis expression is the required low-temperature approximation for the total partition function of the system. The condition $k_B T \\ll \\epsilon$ ensures that contributions from higher energy levels (e.g., with energy $2\\epsilon$) are negligible because the term $\\exp(-\\epsilon / (k_B T))$ is very small, and terms like $\\exp(-2\\epsilon / (k_B T))$ are even smaller.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 + N \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon}{k_{B} T}\\right)}$$", "id": "1984035"}, {"introduction": "The true power of the partition function lies in its role as a bridge from the microscopic quantum world to macroscopic, measurable thermodynamic properties.
