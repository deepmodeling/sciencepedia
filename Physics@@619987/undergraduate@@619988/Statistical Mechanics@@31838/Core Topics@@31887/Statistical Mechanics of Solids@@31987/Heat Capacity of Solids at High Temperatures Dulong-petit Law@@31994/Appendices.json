The crystal is undergoing a solid-solid structural phase transition, where energy is absorbed to rearrange the atomic lattice into a different crystalline configuration.\nB. Quantum mechanical effects, which determine the behavior at low temperatures, unexpectedly become dominant at the high temperature $T_c$, causing a sudden increase in the available vibrational energy states.\nC. The contribution from the material's conduction electrons to the total heat capacity, which is normally negligible for an insulator, becomes exceptionally large and sharply peaked at $T_c$.\nD.
