The ground state corresponds to the configuration with the minimum possible total energy. Since electrons are fermions (spin-1/2 particles), they must obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.\n\nA single-particle quantum state in this system is uniquely defined by the pair of quantum numbers $(n, m_s)$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number for the harmonic oscillator and $m_s$ is the spin projection. The energy of a single-particle state depends only on $n$: $E_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\hbar\\omega$. Spin does not affect the energy in this non-interacting model, leading to spin degeneracy for each energy level.\n\nIn the occupation number representation, the Pauli Exclusion Principle implies that the occupation number $N_{n, m_s}$ for any state $(n, m_s)$ can only be 0 or 1.\n\nTo find the ground state, we fill the single-particle energy levels from the bottom up, respecting the Pauli Exclusion Principle, until all particles are placed.\nThe available single-particle energy levels are:\n- $n=0$: Energy $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. This level has two available states due to spin: $(n=0, m_s=\\uparrow)$ and $(n=0, m_s=\\downarrow)$.\n- $n=1$: Energy $E_1 = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega$. This level has two available states: $(n=1, m_s=\\uparrow)$ and $(n=1, m_s=\\downarrow)$.\n- $n=2$: Energy $E_2 = \\frac{5}{2}\\hbar\\omega$.\n...and so on.\n\nWe need to place two electrons.\n1.  We place the first electron in the lowest possible energy state. The lowest energy is $E_0$, so we can place it in either of the two states with this energy. Let's choose the state $(n=0, m_s=\\uparrow)$. The occupation number for this state becomes $N_{0, \\uparrow} = 1$.\n\n2.  We place the second electron. To keep the total energy minimized, we must place it in the lowest energy state that is still available. The state $(n=0, m_s=\\uparrow)$ is now occupied. However, the other state with the same energy, $(n=0, m_s=\\downarrow)$, is still empty. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, since $(0, \\uparrow)$ and $(0, \\downarrow)$ are distinct quantum states, we can place the second electron in $(n=0, m_s=\\downarrow)$. The occupation number for this state becomes $N_{0, \\downarrow} = 1$.\n\nBoth electrons are now placed in the lowest possible energy configuration. The set of non-zero occupation numbers for this ground state is therefore $N_{0, \\uparrow}=1$ and $N_{0, \\downarrow}=1$. All other occupation numbers $N_{n, m_s}$ for $(n, m_s) \\neq (0, \\uparrow)$ and $(n, m_s) \\neq (0, \\downarrow)$ are zero.\n\nThe total energy of this ground state is $E_{total} = E_0 + E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega = \\hbar\\omega$.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n-   A. $N_{0, \\uparrow}=1, N_{0, \\downarrow}=1$. This matches our derived ground state. It respects the Pauli Principle and minimizes energy.\n-   B. $N_{0, \\uparrow}=2$. This violates the Pauli Exclusion Principle, as it places two fermions in the exact same quantum state $(n=0, m_s=\\uparrow)$. This would be the ground state for two bosons.\n-   C. $N_{0, \\uparrow}=1, N_{1, \\uparrow}=1$. This configuration is valid under the Pauli Principle, but it is not the ground state. Its total energy would be $E_0 + E_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega = 2\\hbar\\omega$. Since $2\\hbar\\omega > \\hbar\\omega$, this is an excited state.\n-   D. $N_{1, \\uparrow}=1, N_{1, \\downarrow}=1$. This is also a valid state, but its energy is $E_1 + E_1 = \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega + \\frac{3}{2}\\hbar\\omega = 3\\hbar\\omega$, which is an even higher energy excited state.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of the ground state is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1981938"}]}
