We have a system containing $N=4$ identical bosons. Due to quantum confinement, the particles can only occupy a discrete set of single-particle energy levels. For this particular system, we are interested in the possible arrangements of these bosons among the $g=5$ lowest-lying, distinct, non-degenerate energy states available to them.\n\nSince the bosons are indistinguishable, the specific identity of each particle does not matter, only the number of particles in each energy state. Furthermore, any number of bosons can occupy a single energy state. Calculate the total number of distinct quantum mechanical configurations, or microstates, in which these four bosons can be distributed among the five available energy states.", "solution": "For indistinguishable bosons in distinct, non-degenerate single-particle states, a many-body microstate is completely specified by the occupation numbers.
