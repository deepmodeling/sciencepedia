The counting of microstates depends on particle distinguishability and occupancy restrictions.\n\nCase A (distinguishable particles, no occupancy restriction): Each of the two labeled particles independently chooses one of the three levels, and sharing a level is allowed. The number of microstates is the number of ordered pairs of level choices:\n$$\nW_{A} = 3 \\times 3 = 9.\n$$\n\nCase B (indistinguishable particles, no occupancy restriction): This is the counting of bosonic occupation-number configurations.
