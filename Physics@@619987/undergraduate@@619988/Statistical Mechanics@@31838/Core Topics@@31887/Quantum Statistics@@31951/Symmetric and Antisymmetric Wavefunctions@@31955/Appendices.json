This practice offers a direct and clear comparison of this principle by asking you to consider a simple system of two identical, but spinless, particles. By analyzing their ground state within a harmonic oscillator potential, you will discover how their distinct statistical nature leads to fundamentally different outcomes, providing a solid foundation for understanding many-particle quantum systems [@problem_id:1994654].", "problem": "Consider a system of two identical, non-interacting, spinless particles of mass $m$ confined in a two-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential given by $V(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 (x^2 + y^2)$.

The two-particle ground state is the symmetric product, which is unique because the single-particle ground state is non-degenerate. Hence $D_{B}=1$.\n\n- Fermions (spinless): By the Pauli principle, both cannot occupy $(0,0)$.

For fermions like electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle governs their behavior, but this principle applies to the *total* wavefunction, which is a combination of spatial and spin parts.

Placing both fermions in the same spatial orbital $(0,0,0)$ makes the spatial part symmetric, so the spin part must be antisymmetric.
