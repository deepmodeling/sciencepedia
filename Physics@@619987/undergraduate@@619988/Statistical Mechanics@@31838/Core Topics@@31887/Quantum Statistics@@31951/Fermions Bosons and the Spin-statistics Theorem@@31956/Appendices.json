This exercise provides a hands-on introduction to the fundamental rules of quantum statistics by contrasting them with the classical case. By enumerating the microstates for distinguishable particles, identical bosons, and identical fermions in a simple two-level system, you will build a crucial foundation for understanding how particle identity shapes the macroscopic world [@problem_id:1966075].", "problem": "Consider a simple quantum system consisting of two particles that are to be distributed among two distinct single-particle energy levels, labeled $\\epsilon_{1}$ and $\\epsilon_{2}$. Your task is to determine the total number of distinct microstates for this two-particle system under three different statistical assumptions. For the purpose of this problem, a microstate is defined by specifying which energy level each particle occupies, while respecting the rules of distinguishability and particle statistics. For the case of fermions, assume the particles have identical spin quantum numbers, meaning the Pauli exclusion principle applies directly to their occupation of the energy levels $\\epsilon_{1}$ and $\\epsilon_{2}$.\n\nCalculate the total number of distinct microstates for each of the following three independent cases:\n- (A) The two particles are distinguishable classical particles.\n- (B) The two particles are identical bosons.\n- (C) The two particles are identical fermions.\n\nLet the number of microstates for cases (A), (B), and (C) be $N_A$, $N_B$, and $N_C$, respectively.

Each of the two particles can independently occupy either $\\epsilon_{1}$ or $\\epsilon_{2}$.\nThus the total number of microstates is\n$$\nN_{A}=2 \\times 2=4,\n$$\ncorresponding to the ordered pairs $(\\epsilon_{1},\\epsilon_{1}),(\\epsilon_{1},\\epsilon_{2}),(\\epsilon_{2},\\epsilon_{1}),(\\epsilon_{2},\\epsilon_{2})$.\n\nCase (B): Identical bosons.\nPrinciple: Bosons are indistinguishable and multiple occupancy of a single level is allowed. The count equals the number of ways to distribute $n=2$ identical particles among $g=2$ levels with no occupancy restriction, given by the stars-and-bars formula\n$$\nN_{B}=\\binom{n+g-1}{n}=\\binom{2+2-1}{2}=\\binom{3}{2}=3.\n$$\nExplicitly, the microstates are: both in $\\epsilon_{1}$, both in $\\epsilon_{2}$, or one in each (which is a single microstate because the particles are indistinguishable).\n\nCase (C): Identical fermions with identical spin.\nPrinciple: The Pauli exclusion principle forbids more than one fermion occupying the same single-particle state. With identical spin quantum numbers and only two distinct single-particle levels, each level can hold at most one fermion. Therefore, both particles must occupy different levels. Because the particles are indistinguishable, there is only one microstate: one particle in $\\epsilon_{1}$ and the other in $\\epsilon_{2}$.\nHence\n$$\nN_{C}=1.\n$$\n\nCollecting the results, the row matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix}4 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}4 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1966075"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of quantum counting, we now explore how these statistical rules manifest in a system's energy.
