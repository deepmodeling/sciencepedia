By considering a simplified model of a crystal with orientational degrees of freedom, you will practice the fundamental skill of counting the total number of microscopic arrangements, or microstates, available to the system.

At very low temperatures, approaching absolute zero, the vibrational and translational degrees of freedom of these molecules can be considered \"frozen out\". However, each molecule retains a degree of orientational freedom. Specifically, the axis of any given molecule can be aligned along one of three mutually perpendicular directions, which we can label as the $x$, $y$, or $z$ axes. Assuming that all possible orientational configurations of the crystal are equally probable, determine the total orientational entropy of the system. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $N$ and the Boltzmann constant, $k_B$.", "solution": "We use the Boltzmann definition of entropy for a system with equally probable microstates. The total entropy is given by\n$$\nS = k_{B} \\ln \\Omega,\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega$ is the total number of accessible microstates.\n\nAt very low temperatures, only the orientational degrees of freedom remain. Each diatomic molecule can align its axis along one of three mutually perpendicular directions, labeled $x$, $y$, or $z$. Since the axis has no directional arrow, $+x$ and $-x$ are equivalent, and similarly for $y$ and $z$, so each molecule has $g=3$ allowed orientations.\n\nThe molecules are on a fixed lattice and are distinguishable by their lattice sites.

Using a relatable, though hypothetical, system of traffic lights, you will learn how to calculate the number of distinct microstates that correspond to a single macroscopic observation. This exercise develops your skills with the combinatorial methods used to find the multiplicity of a given macrostate, a central task in statistical mechanics [@problem_id:1993104].", "problem": "Consider a city's traffic management system which controls a total of $N$ independently operating traffic lights. Each traffic light is distinguishable as it is located at a unique intersection. At any given moment, each light can be in one of three possible states: red, yellow, or green.\n\nA system-wide snapshot is taken, revealing a specific macroscopic state (macrostate) where there are $N_R$ red lights, $N_Y$ yellow lights, and $N_G$ green lights. The total number of lights is conserved, such that $N = N_R + N_Y + N_G$.\n\nAssuming that any specific configuration of lights (microstate) that corresponds to this macrostate is equally probable, derive an expression for the statistical entropy, $S$, of the system. Your answer should be a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $N$, $N_R$, $N_Y$, $N_G$, and the Boltzmann constant, $k_B$.", "solution": "The statistical entropy $S$ is defined by the Boltzmann principle, which relates entropy to the number of accessible microstates, $\\Omega$, corresponding to a given macrostate. The formula is:\n$$S = k_B \\ln(\\Omega)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nOur task is to find the multiplicity, $\\Omega$, for the macrostate defined by $(N_R, N_Y, N_G)$. The multiplicity is the total number of distinct ways to arrange the $N$ distinguishable traffic lights such that there are exactly $N_R$ red, $N_Y$ yellow, and $N_G$ green lights.\n\nThis is a combinatorial problem. Since the traffic lights are distinguishable, we can think of this as arranging $N$ distinct items into three groups of specified sizes.\n\nFirst, let's choose which of the $N$ lights are to be red. The number of ways to choose $N_R$ lights from a total of $N$ is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$C(N, N_R) = \\binom{N}{N_R} = \\frac{N!}{N_R!(N-N_R)!}$$\n\nAfter selecting the red lights, we are left with $N - N_R$ lights. From this remaining pool, we need to choose which $N_Y$ lights will be yellow. The number of ways to do this is:\n$$C(N-N_R, N_Y) = \\binom{N-N_R}{N_Y} = \\frac{(N-N_R)!}{N_Y!(N-N_R-N_Y)!}$$\n\nFinally, the remaining lights must be green. The number of remaining lights is $N - N_R - N_Y$. Since we are given that $N = N_R + N_Y + N_G$, this is equal to $N_G$. The number of ways to choose $N_G$ lights to be green from the remaining $N_G$ lights is:\n$$C(N_G, N_G) = \\binom{N_G}{N_G} = \\frac{N_G!}{N_G!(N_G-N_G)!} = \\frac{N_G!}{N_G!0!} = 1$$\n\nTo find the total number of distinct arrangements, $\\Omega$, we multiply the number of choices at each step:\n$$\\Omega = \\binom{N}{N_R} \\binom{N-N_R}{N_Y} \\binom{N_G}{N_G}$$\n$$\\Omega = \\left(\\frac{N!}{N_R!(N-N_R)!}\\right) \\left(\\frac{(N-N_R)!}{N_Y!(N-N_R-N_Y)!}\\right) (1)$$\n\nThe term $(N-N_R)!$ cancels out. Also, we use the constraint $N_G = N - N_R - N_Y$ in the denominator of the second term.\n$$\\Omega = \\frac{N!}{N_R! N_Y! (N-N_R-N_Y)!} = \\frac{N!}{N_R! N_Y! N_G!}$$\nThis expression is the multinomial coefficient for distributing $N$ distinguishable items into three bins.\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for $\\Omega$ into the Boltzmann entropy formula:\n$$S = k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{N_R!
