The nucleus of each hydrogen atom is a single proton, which is a fermion with spin $1/2$. The total nuclear spin of the $H_2$ molecule can result in two different species: ortho-hydrogen (where the nuclear spins are parallel) and para-hydrogen (where the nuclear spins are antiparallel). We are interested in the properties of para-hydrogen at low temperatures.\n\nA key result from quantum mechanics, known as the spin-statistics theorem, dictates that for a molecule composed of two identical fermions like the protons in $H_2$, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. Since the nuclear spin part of the wavefunction for para-hydrogen is antisymmetric, the rotational part must be symmetric. This symmetry requirement restricts the rotational quantum number, $J$, to only even integer values: $J = 0, 2, 4, \\dots$.\n\nThe energy of each rotational level is given by the formula for a rigid rotor:\n$$ E_J = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1) $$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the molecule.
