This exercise challenges you to move beyond calculation and engage in physical reasoning, explaining why the Pauli exclusion principle drastically suppresses the heat capacity of a Fermi gas at low temperatures, while a Bose gas, free from this constraint, behaves very differently. Understanding this fundamental distinction is key to grasping the essence of quantum statistics and its macroscopic consequences [@problem_id:1970160].", "problem": "Consider two systems of non-interacting particles in a three-dimensional box of volume $V$: an ideal Bose gas and an ideal Fermi gas. Both systems consist of the same number of particles, $N$, and the particles in both systems have the same mass, $m$. At very low temperatures, $T$, such that $T$ is much less than the Fermi temperature $T_F$ for the Fermi gas, and $T$ is below the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature $T_B$ for the Bose gas, it is observed that the molar heat capacity at constant volume, $C_V$, for the Bose gas is significantly larger than that for the Fermi gas.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The Pauli exclusion principle, which applies only to fermions, restricts thermal excitations to a small fraction of particles near the Fermi energy, thus suppressing the heat capacity. Bosons are not subject to this principle, allowing many more particles to be thermally excited from the ground state condensate, resulting in a larger heat capacity.\n\nB. At low temperatures, strong attractive interactions between bosons lead to the formation of a superfluid, which has a very high heat capacity due to collective excitations called phonons. Fermions, on the other hand, have repulsive interactions that increase their ground state energy and reduce the heat capacity.\n\nC. In a Bose gas below $T_B$, a macroscopic number of particles occupy the ground state. Since these particles have zero kinetic energy, they cannot absorb thermal energy, causing all the heat to be absorbed by the few excited particles, which anomalously increases the heat capacity.\n\nD. The chemical potential of the Bose gas becomes strongly negative at low temperatures, which increases the occupation number of low-energy excited states. In contrast, the chemical potential of the Fermi gas remains positive and close to the Fermi energy, limiting the occupation of excited states.\n\nE. The mass of bosons is effectively smaller than the mass of fermions due to quantum effects at low temperatures. This leads to a denser spectrum of energy levels for the Bose gas, allowing for more thermal excitations and thus a higher heat capacity.", "solution": "We compare the low-temperature heat capacities from the definitions of quantum statistics and the density of states for non-interacting particles in three dimensions.\n\nThe heat capacity at constant volume is defined by\n$$\nC_{V}=\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V},\n$$\nwhere $U$ is the internal energy.\n\nFor the ideal Fermi gas at $T \\ll T_{F}$, the Fermi-Dirac distribution\n$$\nf_{F}(\\epsilon)=\\frac{1}{\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon-\\mu}{k_{B}T}\\right)+1}\n$$\nwith $\\mu \\approx E_{F}$ implies that only states within an energy window of order $k_{B}T$ around the Fermi energy $E_{F}$ can change their occupancy because of the Pauli exclusion principle.
