Understanding how to count the number of accessible microstates for a given macroscopic condition, like fixed total energy, is the first step toward connecting the microscopic world to the thermodynamic properties we observe. This problem provides a concrete, hands-on opportunity to practice this fundamental skill by enumerating the distinct arrangements for a simple model of a solid, laying the groundwork for the microcanonical ensemble [@problem_id:1956386].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a crystalline solid composed of a lattice of atoms. We are interested in the vibrational states of a small, isolated subsystem within this solid, which contains three identical but distinguishable atoms, labeled A, B, and C.
