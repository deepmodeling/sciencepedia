This first exercise [@problem_id:92250] provides a hands-on exploration of one of the most common reasons for its failure: the existence of additional constants of motion besides the total energy $E$. By analyzing a simple two-particle system whose dynamics can be separated, you will see explicitly how a time average depends on the initial partitioning of energy, in stark contrast to the microcanonical ensemble average, which only depends on $E$.", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional system of two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$. Their positions are $x_1$ and $x_2$. The system's dynamics are governed by a potential energy function that depends on both the center-of-mass coordinate, $X = \\frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2}{m_1+m_2}$, and the relative coordinate, $x = x_1 - x_2$. The potential is given by a sum of two harmonic terms:\n$$\nV(X, x) = \\frac{1}{2}k_X X^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k_x x^2\n$$\nwhere $k_X$ and $k_x$ are positive constants. Due to this potential, the Hamiltonian is separable in the center-of-mass and relative coordinates. This leads to two separate conserved quantities: the energy of the center-of-mass motion, $E_{CM}$, and the energy of the relative motion, $E_{rel}$. The total energy of the system is $E = E_{CM} + E_{rel}$, which is also conserved.\n\nA specific dynamical trajectory of the system is prepared such that the total energy $E$ is partitioned between the two modes as follows:\n$$\nE_{CM} = \\alpha E \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E_{rel} = (1-\\alpha)E\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a constant with $0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$.
