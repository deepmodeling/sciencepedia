This first practice problem provides a direct application of the principle of equal a priori probabilities by asking you to count the arrangements of distinguishable particles. By calculating the probability of a specific distribution, you will reinforce the crucial distinction between a microstate (a specific configuration of all particles) and a macrostate (a general property, like the number of particles in each container) [@problem_id:1986878].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model for a biological system where four distinguishable ligand molecules, labeled L1, L2, L3, and L4, are available to bind to a large polymer. The polymer has exactly two identical, non-interacting binding sites. Any number of ligands, from zero to four, can occupy a given site. The specific arrangement of the four ligands across the two sites defines a microstate of the system. A macrostate is defined only by the number of ligands on each site, not their identities.\n\nBased on the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics, the principle of equal a priori probabilities, every possible microstate of this isolated system is equally likely to be observed.

Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "By the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics (principle of equal a priori probabilities), each microstate of the isolated system is equally likely. A microstate is specified by assigning each distinguishable ligand to one of the two binding sites. Since the sites are energetically identical but physically distinct locations, the assignment of each ligand is an independent binary choice.\n\nThe total number of microstates is therefore given by the multiplication rule:\n$$\nN_{\\text{tot}}=2^{4} = 16.\n$$\n\nThe macrostate of interest has two ligands on one site and two on the other. The number of microstates realizing this macrostate is the number of ways to choose which two of the four ligands occupy, say, site 1, with the remaining two necessarily on site 2. This is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\nN_{\\text{fav}}=\\binom{4}{2}=\\frac{4!}{2!\\,2!}=6.\n$$\n\nBy the fundamental postulate, the probability of the macrostate is the ratio of favorable to total microstates:\n$$\nP=\\frac{N_{\\text{fav}}}{N_{\\text{tot}}}=\\frac{\\binom{4}{2}}{2^{4}}=\\frac{6}{16}=\\frac{3}{8}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{8}}$$", "id": "1986878"}, {"introduction": "Real physical systems often operate under constraints, such as a fixed total energy.

Because the proteins are indistinguishable, each valid placement corresponds to a unique choice of $M$ sites with no two consecutive.\n\nTo enforce the non-adjacency constraint, we note that between any two occupied sites there must be at least one empty site. Place the $M$ occupied sites first, which requires $M-1$ mandatory separating empty sites. This uses $M+(M-1)=2M-1$ sites. The remaining number of empty sites is therefore\n$$\nN-(2M-1)=N-2M+1.\n$$\nThese remaining empty sites can be distributed freely as nonnegative integers among the $M+1$ gap positions: before the first occupied site, between consecutive occupied sites (beyond the mandatory single empties), and after the last occupied site.
