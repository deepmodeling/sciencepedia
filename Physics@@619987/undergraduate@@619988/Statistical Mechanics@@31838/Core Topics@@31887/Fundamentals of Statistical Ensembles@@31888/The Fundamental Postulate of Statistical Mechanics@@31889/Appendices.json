The crystal lattice is a linear chain consisting of exactly four distinct lattice sites. This short chain is populated by two atoms of element A and two atoms of element B. The atoms of the same element are indistinguishable from each other. The physical properties of the alloy depend on the specific arrangement of these atoms on the lattice sites. According to the fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics, in the absence of external influences, each of these unique arrangements is equally likely to occur.
