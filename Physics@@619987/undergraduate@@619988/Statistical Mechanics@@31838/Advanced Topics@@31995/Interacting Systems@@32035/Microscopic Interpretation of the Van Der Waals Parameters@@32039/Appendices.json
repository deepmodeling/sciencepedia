This first exercise grounds our understanding in the standard model for the van der Waals parameter $b$. By considering spherical molecules, we will quantitatively explore how $b$ relates not to the volume of a single molecule, but to a larger \"excluded volume\" arising from pairwise interactions, and how this volume scales with molecular size [@problem_id:1980474]. This forms the foundation for interpreting experimental data for real gases.", "problem": "The van der Waals equation of state provides a more accurate description of real gases compared to the ideal gas law. It is given by:\n$$ (P + \\frac{an^2}{V^2}) (V - nb) = nRT $$\nIn this equation, $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, $n$ is the number of moles, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. $R$ is the universal gas constant, and the parameters $a$ and $b$ are empirical constants specific to the gas. The parameter $b$ is introduced to account for the finite volume occupied by the gas molecules, which are modeled as hard spheres.\n\nSuppose we have a gas, Gas A, composed of spherical molecules of diameter $d_A$. We then consider a hypothetical gas, Gas B, whose molecules are also spherical but have a diameter $d_B$ that is exactly four times the diameter of the molecules of Gas A, i.e., $d_B = 4d_A$. Based on the physical origin of the parameter $b$, determine the factor by which the van der Waals parameter for Gas B, $b_B$, is greater than that for Gas A, $b_A$. Your answer should be the ratio $b_B / b_A$.", "solution": "The van der Waals parameter $b$ accounts for the reduction of available volume due to finite molecular size and, for hard-sphere molecules, is equal to the molar excluded volume.

In this model, the system is treated as a two-dimensional gas composed of a large number of identical, impenetrable hard disks. Each disk has a radius $r_0$. The equation of state for such a gas can be approximated by a two-dimensional analogue of the van der Waals equation. The key correction to the ideal gas law in this context is the concept of an \"excluded area\"â€”the area that is unavailable to the center of any given particle due to the presence of all the other particles.\n\nThe total excluded area in the system is found to be proportional to the number of particles, $N$. We define a parameter $b_{2D}$ as the excluded area per particle. Based on a geometric argument considering the interaction between a single pair of hard disks, determine the expression for $b_{2D}$. Express your answer in terms of the disk radius $r_0$ and mathematical constants.", "solution": "We model the molecules as identical hard disks of radius $r_{0}$. For a given disk, the center of any other disk cannot come within a distance $2r_{0}$ of its center.

These spheres are confined within a very narrow cylindrical channel of total length $L$, such that their centers can only move along a single line. The radius of the channel is only infinitesimally larger than the radius of the spheres, and the density of the spheres is high enough that they cannot pass one another. This effectively constrains their motion to a single dimension. The positions of the centers of the spheres are denoted by $x_i$, where $0  x_i  L$. The hard-sphere interaction potential is zero if the distance between the centers of any two spheres is greater than $\\sigma$, and infinite otherwise. The entire system is in thermal equilibrium at a constant temperature $T$.\n\nYour task is broken into two parts. First, derive the exact equation of state for this quasi-one-dimensional gas, also known as a Tonks gas. The equation of state should relate the force $F$ (the 1D analogue of pressure), the length $L$, the number of particles $N$, and the temperature $T$.
