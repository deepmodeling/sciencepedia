The interaction potential between any pair of particles is modeled by an attractive Gaussian well, $U(r) = -U_0 \\exp(-r^2/a^2)$, where $r$ is the interparticle distance. In this expression, $U_0$ is a positive constant representing the potential depth, and $a$ is a positive constant representing the interaction range. The gas is maintained at a high temperature $T$ such that the thermal energy is much larger than the potential depth, i.e., $k_B T \\gg U_0$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.
