It provides the probability of finding a particle at a distance $r$ from a reference particle. A key step in computing $g(r)$ from simulation data is to construct a histogram of inter-particle distances.\n\nConsider a 2D computer simulation of $N=4$ identical point particles confined to a square box of side length $L$. The simulation employs periodic boundary conditions. This means if a particle moves out of one side of the box, it re-enters from the opposite side. Consequently, the distance between any two particles must be calculated using the minimum image convention. For any pair of particles, if the separation in a given dimension (e.g., $x$) is $\\Delta x$, the convention dictates using the shortest distance, $\\Delta x'$, which may involve \"wrapping around\" the box. This is found by ensuring $|\\Delta x'| \\leq L/2$. The same logic applies to the $y$ dimension. The total distance is then the Euclidean distance calculated from these minimum image separation components.\n\nAt a particular instant, a snapshot of the system records the positions $(x_i, y_i)$ of the four particles as follows, given in dimensionless coordinates scaled by the box length $L$:\n\n-   Particle 1: $(0.10, 0.20)$\n-   Particle 2: $(0.40, 0.30)$\n-   Particle 3: $(0.80, 0.90)$\n-   Particle 4: $(0.95, 0.10)$\n\nYour task is to calculate the number of unique particle pairs whose separation distance $d$ falls within the specific radial bin defined by the range $[0.40L, 0.50L]$.", "solution": "We work in reduced coordinates scaled by $L$, so each position component lies in $[0,1)$.

For a liquid, $g(r)$ gives the probability of finding a particle at a radial distance $r$ from a central reference particle, relative to the probability expected for a completely uniform distribution at the same density. The first prominent peak in the plot of $g(r)$ versus $r$ corresponds to the first \"coordination shell\" of nearest neighbors surrounding the reference particle. The height of this peak indicates the degree of local ordering, while its width reflects the range of distances over which these nearest neighbors are found.\n\nConsider a simple monoatomic liquid, such as liquid argon, confined within a rigid container of fixed volume $V$.
