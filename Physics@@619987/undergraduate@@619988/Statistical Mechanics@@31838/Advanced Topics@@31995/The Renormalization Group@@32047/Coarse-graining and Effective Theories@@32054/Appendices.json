Consider a very long chain of spins, where each spin $s_i$ can take a value of $+1$ or $-1$. The total energy of the system is given by the Hamiltonian $H = -J \\sum_{i} s_i s_{i+1}$, where the sum runs over all nearest-neighbor pairs, and $J > 0$ is a positive constant representing the interaction energy.\n\nWe aim to simplify this model by creating an effective theory for only half of the spins. This is achieved through a decimation procedure where we 'integrate out' all the even-indexed spins ($s_2, s_4, s_6, \\dots$). In the low-temperature limit (where the thermal energy $k_B T$ is much smaller than the interaction energy $J$), the system will overwhelmingly occupy its lowest energy state. This means that for any given configuration of the odd-indexed spins ($s_1, s_3, s_5, \\dots$), the even-indexed spins will arrange themselves to minimize the total energy.\n\nThis process results in an effective interaction between the remaining odd-indexed spins. Determine the effective interaction energy, $H'_{\\text{eff}}$, for a single pair of adjacent odd-indexed spins, $s_{2k-1}$ and $s_{2k+1}$. This is the energy contribution that arises from minimizing the energy of the triplet $(s_{2k-1}, s_{2k}, s_{2k+1})$ with respect to the central, even-indexed spin $s_{2k}$.
