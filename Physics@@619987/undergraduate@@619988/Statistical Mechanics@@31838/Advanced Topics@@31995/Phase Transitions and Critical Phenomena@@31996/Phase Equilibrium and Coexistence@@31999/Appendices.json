For the process of sublimation, a substance transitions directly from the solid to the gas phase. The energy required to transform one mole of the substance is called the molar latent heat of sublimation, denoted by $L_{\\text{sub}}$.\n\nConsider a system where a substance undergoes sublimation at a constant temperature $T$ and constant pressure $P$. Let $h_s$ represent the molar enthalpy of the substance in the solid phase just at the transition point, and let $h_g$ represent the molar enthalpy of the substance in the gas phase at the same transition point.\n\nWhich of the following expressions correctly relates the molar latent heat of sublimation, $L_{\\text{sub}}$, to the molar enthalpies of the solid and gas phases?\n\nA. $L_{\\text{sub}} = h_g - h_s$\n\nB. $L_{\\text{sub}} = h_s - h_g$\n\nC. $L_{\\text{sub}} = h_s + h_g$\n\nD. $L_{\\text{sub}} = \\frac{h_s + h_g}{2}$\n\nE. $L_{\\text{sub}} = \\sqrt{h_g h_s}$", "solution": "For a simple compressible system with only pressure-volume work, the first law gives\n$$\ndU=\\delta Q - P\\,dV.\n$$\nDefine enthalpy by $H=U+PV$, so its differential is\n$$\ndH=dU+P\\,dV+V\\,dP.\n$$\nEliminating $dU$ using the first law yields\n$$\ndH=\\delta Q + V\\,dP.\n$$\nAt constant pressure, $dP=0$, hence\n$$\ndH=\\delta Q.\n$$\nFor one mole, $h=H/n$ and thus $dh=\\delta q$ at constant pressure. Across a phase transition at constant temperature and pressure, the latent heat per mole is the heat absorbed or released during the transition, so integrating gives\n$$\nL_{\\text{sub}}=\\int \\delta q=\\int dh=h_{g}-h_{s},\n$$\nwhere $h_{s}$ and $h_{g}$ are the molar enthalpies of the solid and gas, respectively, evaluated at the coexistence temperature and pressure.
