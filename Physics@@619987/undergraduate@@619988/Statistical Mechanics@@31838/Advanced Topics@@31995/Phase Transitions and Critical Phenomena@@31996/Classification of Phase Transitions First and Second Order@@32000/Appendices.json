The order parameter is zero in the high-symmetry (high-temperature) phase and non-zero in the low-symmetry (low-temperature) phase.\n\nConsider a crystal undergoing a structural phase transition from a high-temperature cubic phase to a low-temperature tetragonal phase. The tetragonal distortion can be characterized by a scalar order parameter $m$, which is proportional to the strain that breaks the cubic symmetry. For this transition, the Landau free energy can be written as:\n\n$$F(T, m) = F_0(T) + \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha (T-T_c) m^2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\beta m^3 + \\frac{1}{4} \\gamma m^4 + \\dots$$\n\nHere, $F_0(T)$ is the background free energy, and $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ are phenomenological coefficients assumed to be approximately constant with temperature, with $\\alpha  0$ and $\\gamma  0$ required for stability.

The high-temperature phase has cubic point-group symmetry $O_{h}$.
