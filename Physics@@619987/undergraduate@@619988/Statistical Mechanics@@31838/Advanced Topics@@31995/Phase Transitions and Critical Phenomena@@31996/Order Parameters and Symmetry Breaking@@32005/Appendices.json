Each site of the lattice is independently occupied with a probability $p$ or left vacant with a probability $1-p$. Clusters are defined as groups of connected occupied sites, where \"connected\" means sites are nearest neighbors. This system exhibits a phase transition at a critical probability $p_c$. For $p < p_c$, all clusters are of finite size. For $p > p_c$, there is a non-zero probability of an infinite cluster spanning the entire lattice.\n\nA suitable order parameter for this transition is $P_{\\infty}(p)$, defined as the probability that a randomly chosen occupied site belongs to the infinite cluster.

The percolation transition breaks the discrete translational symmetry of the lattice because the shape of the infinite cluster is random and not periodic.\nB. The symmetry that is broken is the probabilistic symmetry where any of the numerous large, but finite, clusters below $p_c$ could have become the infinite one.\nC. The concept of a Hamiltonian-based symmetry and its breaking is inapplicable because the site occupations are fixed by an external random process, rather than being dynamic degrees of freedom that equilibrate to minimize a free energy.\nD. The system does have an underlying Hamiltonian, $H=0$, whose perfect symmetry is broken by the random appearance of an infinite cluster.\nE. The percolation transition is a first-order transition, whereas spontaneous symmetry breaking only occurs in continuous (second-order) transitions.\n\n", "solution": "We compare the nature of symmetry and order parameters in the Ising model versus site percolation.\n\nIn the Ising model, the degrees of freedom are spins $s_{i}=\\pm 1$ that are dynamical and distributed with a Gibbs measure proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta H)$, with Hamiltonian $H=-J\\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle}s_{i}s_{j}$.
