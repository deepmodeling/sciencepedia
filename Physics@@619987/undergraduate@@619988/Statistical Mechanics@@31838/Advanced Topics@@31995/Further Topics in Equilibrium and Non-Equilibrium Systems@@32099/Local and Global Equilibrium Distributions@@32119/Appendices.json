According to the principles of statistical mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a microstate with energy $E$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-E/(k_B T))$. For a gas in an external potential $V(\\vec{r})$, the kinetic energy distribution is independent of position, but the potential energy varies with position. The local number density of particles, $n(\\vec{r})$, at a position $\\vec{r}$ is therefore proportional to the Boltzmann factor associated with the potential energy at that location.\n\nWe can write this relationship as:\n$$n(\\vec{r}) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V(\\vec{r})}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nTo turn this proportionality into an equation, we can use the density at a reference point. A convenient reference point is the center of the trap, $\\vec{r}=0$, where the potential energy is minimum. Let the density at the center be $n(0)$. The potential at the center is $V(0) = \\frac{1}{2} K (0)^2 = 0$.

The equation for the density becomes:\n$$n(\\vec{r}) = n(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V(\\vec{r})}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nThe given potential is $V(r) = \\frac{1}{2} K r^2$. Since the potential depends only on the radial distance $r = |\\vec{r}|$, the density will also be spherically symmetric, i.e., $n(\\vec{r}) = n(r)$. Substituting the potential into the density equation gives:\n$$n(r) = n(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} K r^2}{k_B T}\\right) = n(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{K r^2}{2 k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the radius $R_{1/2}$ at which the density is half of its central value.
