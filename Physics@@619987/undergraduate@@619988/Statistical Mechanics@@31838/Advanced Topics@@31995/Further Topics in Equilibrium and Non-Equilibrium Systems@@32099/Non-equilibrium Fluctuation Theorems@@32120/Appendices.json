A simplified classical model for such a trap is a one-dimensional harmonic potential. This problem explores the thermodynamics of a non-equilibrium process in such a system.\n\nConsider a single classical particle of mass $m$ moving in one dimension. The particle is confined by a harmonic potential $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}Kx^2$, where $K$ is the trap's spring constant or \"stiffness\". The particle is initially in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at a constant temperature $T$. At time $t=0$, the stiffness of the trap is $K=K_1$.\n\nA non-equilibrium process is then performed: the stiffness of the trap is instantaneously changed from its initial value $K_1$ to a new final value $K_2$. The work, $W$, done on the particle during this process is defined as the change in the particle's energy, which depends on its position and momentum at the moment the process occurs.\n\nCalculate the ensemble average of the quantity $\\exp(-\\beta W)$, which is denoted as $\\langle \\exp(-\\beta W) \\rangle$.

The initial Hamiltonian of the system is:\n$$H_1(x, p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}K_1x^2$$\nThe system is described by the canonical ensemble. The probability density in phase space $(x, p)$ is given by:\n$$P_1(x, p) = \\frac{1}{Z_1} \\exp(-\\beta H_1(x, p))$$\nwhere $Z_1$ is the initial partition function. $Z_1$ is calculated by integrating the Boltzmann factor over all possible states in phase space:\n$$Z_1 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\left(\\frac{p^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}K_1x^2\\right)\\right) dx \\, dp$$\n\n**Step 2: Define the Final State and Calculate the Work Done**\nThe stiffness of the trap is instantaneously changed from $K_1$ to $K_2$.
