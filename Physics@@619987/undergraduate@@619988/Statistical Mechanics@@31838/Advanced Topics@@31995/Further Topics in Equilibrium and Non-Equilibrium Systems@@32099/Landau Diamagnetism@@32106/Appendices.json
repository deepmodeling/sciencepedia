Consider a simplified model of such a system, based on Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), placed in a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B=1.00$ Tesla, oriented perpendicular to the plane of electron confinement.\n\nWithin the GaAs crystal, the electrons respond to external forces as if they have an effective mass, $m^*$, which is different from the rest mass of a free electron in a vacuum, $m_e$.
