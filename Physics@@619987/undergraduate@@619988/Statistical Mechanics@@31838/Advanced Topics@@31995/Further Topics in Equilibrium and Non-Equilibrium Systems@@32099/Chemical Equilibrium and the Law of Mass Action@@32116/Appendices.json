This exercise highlights how the balance between entropy (favoring dissociation) and energy (favoring bond formation) is quantitatively captured by the partition function.", "problem": "Consider a simplified model for the thermal dissociation of a diatomic gas, $X_2$, within a high-temperature chamber. The process is described by the chemical reaction $X_2 \\rightleftharpoons 2X$. The gas mixture is at thermal equilibrium at a high temperature $T$.\n\nLet the mass of a single atom of species $X$ be $m$. The diatomic molecule $X_2$ thus has a mass of $2m$. The energy required to break a stationary $X_2$ molecule into two separate, stationary $X$ atoms is the dissociation energy, denoted by $\\epsilon_D > 0$. For the purpose of this problem, you are to establish the zero of the energy scale such that two separate, stationary $X$ atoms have a total energy of zero.\n\nTo make the problem tractable, make the following simplifying assumptions:\n1.  The atoms ($X$) and molecules ($X_2$) can be treated as non-interacting point particles, forming an ideal gas mixture.\n2.  All internal degrees of freedom of the diatomic molecule (i.e., vibrational and rotational modes) can be neglected.\n\nUsing the formalism of statistical mechanics, derive an expression for the equilibrium constant $K_c(T)$ for this reaction. The equilibrium constant is defined in terms of number concentrations (particles per unit volume) as $K_c = \\frac{[X]^2}{[X_2]}$.
