By considering a system with random interactions but no closed loops (a Cayley tree), you will uncover a crucial insight: frustration arises not just from disordered bonds, but from the combination of disorder and a looped topology that creates conflicting constraints.

Yes, frustration is possible. The presence of random negative (antiferromagnetic) couplings $J_{ij}$ is a sufficient condition for frustration to occur.\n\nC. Yes, frustration is possible.
