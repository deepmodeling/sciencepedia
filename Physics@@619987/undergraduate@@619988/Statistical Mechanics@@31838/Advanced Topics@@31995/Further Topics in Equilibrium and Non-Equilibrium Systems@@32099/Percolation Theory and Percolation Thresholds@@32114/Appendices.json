This exercise serves as a crucial starting point because it reveals how dimensionality profoundly impacts connectivity. By analyzing the conditions required for a signal to traverse an infinitely long, linear path, you will discover why one-dimensional systems are uniquely fragile and calculate their exact percolation threshold. [@problem_id:1985036]", "problem": "A new type of optical fiber for long-haul communication is being developed. It can be modeled as a one-dimensional chain of an extremely large, effectively infinite, number of discrete scattering sites. For a light signal to propagate successfully from one end of the fiber to the other, it must be transmitted without significant loss through every single site in sequence.\n\nDue to microscopic imperfections, each site has an independent probability, $p$, of being \"transmissive\" (allowing the signal to pass) and a probability, $1-p$, of being \"opaque\" (blocking the signal). If even one site along the infinite chain is opaque, the entire communication link fails.\n\nA successful end-to-end transmission requires a \"spanning cluster\" of transmissive sites, which is an unbroken path of transmissive sites extending across the entire infinite length of the fiber. The system exhibits a phase transition at a specific critical probability, $p_c$, known as the site percolation threshold. For $p > p_c$, there is a non-zero probability of forming a spanning cluster, enabling communication. For $p < p_c$, the probability of forming a spanning cluster is exactly zero, and communication is impossible.\n\nDetermine the exact value of this critical probability $p_c$. The answer is a dimensionless number.", "solution": "Model the fiber as sites indexed by the integers, with each site independently transmissive (open) with probability $p$ and opaque (closed) with probability $1-p$. In one dimension, connected open clusters are exactly maximal blocks of consecutive open sites.\n\nA spanning cluster across the entire infinite chain requires an unbroken path of open sites that connects all sites, i.e., there can be no closed site anywhere on the chain. Equivalently, the event of successful end-to-end transmission is the event that every site is open.\n\nConsider the finite segment consisting of the first $N$ sites. The probability that all $N$ sites are open is\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\text{first } N \\text{ sites all open}) = p^{N}.\n$$\nTo have a spanning cluster across the entire infinite chain, all sites must be open, so the probability of spanning is the limit\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\text{spanning cluster}) = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N}.\n$$\nFor $0 \\leq p < 1$, one has\n$$\n\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} p^{N} = 0,\n$$\nso the probability of spanning is exactly zero.

This model is extremely important in statistical physics because it has no loops, which often allows for exact solutions where regular lattices are intractable. This problem challenges you to calculate the bond percolation threshold on such a lattice, introducing a powerful recursive method that showcases how higher connectivity allows for a robust network to form even when individual links are unreliable. [@problem_id:1985032]", "problem": "Consider an idealized, infinitely large network model for signal propagation. The network originates from a single central node, the \"root.\" This network has a perfectly regular, tree-like structure without any loops, which is formally known as a Bethe lattice. In this structure, every node, except for those at the infinite boundary, is connected to exactly $z$ other nodes, where $z$ is a constant integer greater than or equal to 3, called the coordination number. The root node is connected to $z$ neighbors, each of which is connected to $z-1$ new neighbors, and so on.\n\nWe are interested in how a signal propagates through this network. Each connection (or \"bond\") between any two adjacent nodes has an independent probability $p$ of being \"open\" or functional, and a probability $1-p$ of being \"closed\" or non-functional. A signal can only travel along open connections.\n\nA signal is initiated at the root node. We want to determine the condition under which this signal has a non-zero chance of propagating infinitely far away from the root. This transition occurs at a critical probability, denoted $p_c$. For any probability $p > p_c$, there is a finite probability of infinite propagation, while for $p < p_c$, the signal is guaranteed to travel only a finite distance from the root before terminating.\n\nYour task is to find the exact value of this critical probability, $p_c$, as a function of the coordination number $z$.", "solution": "Let $z \\geq 3$ be the coordination number and let each bond be open independently with probability $p$. Because the graph is a tree (Bethe lattice), the exploration of the cluster reachable from the root is described by a branching process.\n\nDefine $q$ to be the probability that the signal starting from a given directed edge away from an already reached node does not reach infinity (i.e., the forward branch dies out). By the self-similarity of the tree, $q$ satisfies a recursive fixed-point equation obtained by conditioning on the state of the first bond:\n- With probability $1-p$ the bond is closed and the branch dies immediately.\n- With probability $p$ the bond is open; then, at the next vertex there are $z-1$ further, independent forward bonds, each of which must also fail to reach infinity for the branch to die out, which happens with probability $q^{z-1}$.\n\nThus,\n$$\nq = (1 - p) + p\\, q^{z-1}.\n$$\nLet $r(q) = (1 - p) + p\\, q^{z-1}$. Fixed points satisfy $q = r(q)$. The trivial solution $q=1$ always exists. A nontrivial solution with $q<1$ (equivalently, a positive survival probability $1-q>0$) exists if and only if the slope of $r$ at $q=1$ exceeds $1$, which ensures an additional intersection in $[0,1)$ due to monotonicity and convexity of $r$ on $[0,1]$.\n\nCompute the derivative:\n$$\nr'(q) = p (z-1) q^{z-2},\n$$\nso\n$$\nr'(1) = p (z-1).\n$$\nThe threshold occurs when $r'(1) = 1$, giving\n$$\np_{c} (z-1) = 1 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad p_{c} = \\frac{1}{z-1}.\n$$\nFor $p > p_{c}$, there is a solution $q<1$ and hence a strictly positive probability that the signal propagates to infinity; for $p < p_{c}$, the only solution is $q=1$ and the signal dies out almost surely.

This problem shifts our perspective from probability to determinism: instead of asking \"what is the probability of a spanning path?\", we ask \"what is the minimum number of occupied sites needed to *guarantee* one?\". This combinatorial puzzle forces you to think about worst-case scenarios and the geometric arrangements that block or ensure connectivity, providing a tangible feel for the concept of a spanning cluster. [@problem_id:1985022]", "problem": "Consider a system modeled by a square grid of $3 \\times 3$ sites. Each site in the grid can be in one of two states: 'occupied' or 'unoccupied'. A cluster is defined as a set of occupied sites that are connected. Two sites are considered connected if they are adjacent, meaning they share a common edge (up, down, left, or right). A diagonal connection (sharing only a corner) does not count as adjacency.\n\nA \"spanning cluster\" is a special type of cluster that establishes a continuous path of occupied sites from the top row of the grid (row 1) to the bottom row of the grid (row 3). This means a spanning cluster must contain at least one occupied site in row 1 and at least one occupied site in row 3, with a complete path of adjacent occupied sites linking them.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of occupied sites, out of the total of 9 sites, that is required to *guarantee* the existence of at least one spanning cluster, irrespective of the specific arrangement of the occupied sites on the grid.", "solution": "Let $k$ be the number of occupied sites and let $u=9-k$ be the number of unoccupied sites. We seek the smallest $k$ such that, for every placement of $u$ unoccupied sites, there is a top-to-bottom path of occupied sites.\n\nNecessity: If $u\\geq 3$, an adversary can choose all three sites in the top row to be unoccupied. Then there is no occupied site in row $1$, so no spanning cluster can exist by definition. Equivalently, the adversary could choose all three sites in the middle row (row $2$) to be unoccupied; since any path from row $1$ to row $3$ must pass through row $2$, this also blocks any spanning path. Therefore, to guarantee a spanning cluster regardless of arrangement, we must have $u\\leq 2$, i.e., $k\\geq 7$.\n\nSufficiency for $k=7$ (that is, $u=2$): Partition the grid into its three vertical columns. To prevent every vertical top-to-bottom path, the unoccupied set must include at least one site in each column, because each column $j$ provides a vertical path $(1,j)\\to(2,j)\\to(3,j)$ using only edge-adjacencies. By the pigeonhole principle, with only $u=2$ unoccupied sites, it is impossible to hit all three columns, so at least one entire column remains fully occupied. The three sites in that column form an adjacent path from the top row to the bottom row, which is a spanning cluster. Hence, with $k=7$, a spanning cluster is guaranteed irrespective of the arrangement.\n\nMinimality follows because for $k=6$ (i.e., $u=3$) there exists an arrangement (e.g., all three sites in row $2$ unoccupied) that blocks any top-to-bottom path. Therefore, the minimum $k$ that guarantees a spanning cluster is $7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "1985022"}]}
