This initial practice explores the topological relationship between a lattice and its dual in an idealized setting without boundaries, which is essential for formal proofs in statistical mechanics. By considering a lattice with periodic boundary conditions—topologically a torus—you will determine the structure of its dual, laying the groundwork for the physical duality to come [@problem_id:1974435].", "problem": "In the study of 2D statistical models, such as the Ising model for magnetism, the concept of a dual lattice provides powerful insights. Consider a system of spins arranged on a finite $L \\times L$ square lattice. The topology of this lattice, which describes its fundamental connectivity, is determined by its boundary conditions. Let the original, or \"primal,\" lattice be constructed with periodic boundary conditions in both directions. This means the site at row $i$ and column $L$ is connected to the site at row $i$ and column $1$, and the site at row $L$ and column $j$ is connected to the site at row $1$ and column $j$ for all $i,j \\in \\{1, \\dots, L\\}$. This configuration makes the primal lattice topologically equivalent to a torus.\n\nA dual lattice is constructed from the primal lattice according to the following rules:\n1.  A dual vertex is placed in the geometric center of each elementary square face (plaquette) of the primal lattice.\n2.  A dual edge is drawn to connect two dual vertices if and only if their corresponding faces in the primal lattice share a common edge.\n\nGiven this construction for the $L \\times L$ primal lattice on a torus, which of the following statements correctly describes the resulting dual lattice?\n\nA. The dual lattice is an $L \\times L$ square lattice with open boundaries, topologically equivalent to a disk.\n\nB.

The dual lattice consists of two separate, disconnected $L \\times (L/2)$ lattices.\n\nE. The construction is ill-defined because the faces at the boundary of the primal lattice have a different structure than interior faces.", "solution": "The primal lattice is an $L \\times L$ square grid with periodic boundary conditions in both directions, hence it is embedded on a torus. Under the dual construction:\n1. Each elementary face (plaquette) of the primal lattice becomes a dual vertex. Because periodic boundary conditions remove boundaries, there are exactly $L^2$ plaquettes, so the dual has $V_{\\text{dual}} = L^2$ vertices.\n2. Two dual vertices are connected by a dual edge if and only if the corresponding primal faces share an edge. On the torus, every primal edge is shared by exactly two faces (including wrap-around identifications). Hence each primal edge yields exactly one dual edge, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between primal and dual edges. Counting gives $E_{\\text{dual}} = E_{\\text{primal}} = 2L^2$, since the primal has $L^2$ horizontal and $L^2$ vertical edges.\n3. The local adjacency of faces is uniform: each primal face has four neighbors (up, down, left, right) with wrap-around across boundaries. Therefore, each dual vertex has degree $4$, and the dual adjacency pattern is that of a square lattice with periodic identifications in both directions.\n\nTopologically, duality for a cellular embedding preserves the surface: if the primal graph is embedded on a surface of genus $g$, so is the dual. Equivalently, the Euler characteristic satisfies $\\chi = V-E+F = 0$ for the torus, and under duality $V_{\\text{dual}} = F_{\\text{primal}}$, $E_{\\text{dual}} = E_{\\text{primal}}$, $F_{\\text{dual}} = V_{\\text{primal}}$, preserving $\\chi=0$. Hence the dual is also embedded on a torus.\n\nThese facts eliminate the alternatives:\n- A and B are incorrect because periodic boundaries imply no boundary and thus no open-boundary dual; furthermore, there are $L^2$ faces, not $(L-1)^2$.\n- D is incorrect because periodic identifications do not disconnect the dual; the dual remains a single connected toroidal lattice.\n- E is incorrect because on the torus there are no boundary faces; all faces are equivalent, so the construction is well-defined.\n\nTherefore, the dual lattice is an $L \\times L$ square lattice with periodic boundary conditions, topologically a torus.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1974435"}, {"introduction": "Having established the geometric concept of duality, we can now examine the physics.
