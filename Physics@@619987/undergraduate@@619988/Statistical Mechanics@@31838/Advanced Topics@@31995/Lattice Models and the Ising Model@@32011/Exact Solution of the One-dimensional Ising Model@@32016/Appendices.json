The magnetic orientation of each ion can be modeled as a classical spin, $s_i$, which can point either \"up\" ($s_i = +1$) or \"down\" ($s_i = -1$). The ions are indexed $i=1, 2, 3$ as one moves around the triangle.\n\nThe total energy of the system is governed by the nearest-neighbor interactions described by the Ising model Hamiltonian. In the absence of an external magnetic field, this energy is given by:\n$$E = -J \\sum_{i=1}^{3} s_i s_{i+1}$$\nIn this expression, $J$ is the exchange coupling constant. The sum represents the interaction between each spin and its next neighbor in the ring, thus imposing periodic boundary conditions where the third spin interacts with the first, formally written as $s_4 \\equiv s_1$.\n\nThe system is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at an absolute temperature $T$.

It is convenient to define the parameter $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$.

This gives a total of $2^3 = 8$ possible microstates. We must enumerate each state, calculate its energy, and then sum the corresponding Boltzmann factors.\n\nThe energy for any given state $(s_1, s_2, s_3)$ is calculated using the Hamiltonian with periodic boundary conditions ($s_4=s_1$):\n$$E(s_1, s_2, s_3) = -J(s_1 s_2 + s_2 s_3 + s_3 s_1)$$\n\nLet's list all 8 microstates and their corresponding energies:\n\n1.  **State (+1, +1, +1):** All spins are aligned ('up').\n    $E_1 = -J((+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)) = -J(1+1+1) = -3J$.\n\n2.  **State (-1, -1, -1):** All spins are aligned ('down').\n    $E_2 = -J((-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)) = -J(1+1+1) = -3J$.\n\n3.  **State (+1, +1, -1):** One spin is 'down', two are 'up'.\n    $E_3 = -J((+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(+1)) = -J(1-1-1) = +J$.\n\n4.  **State (+1, -1, +1):** This is a cyclic permutation of the previous state.\n    $E_4 = -J((+1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1)) = -J(-1-1+1) = +J$.\n\n5.  **State (-1, +1, +1):** This is another cyclic permutation.\n    $E_5 = -J((-1)(+1) + (+1)(+1) + (+1)(-1)) = -J(-1+1-1) = +J$.\n\n6.  **State (-1, -1, +1):** Two spins are 'down', one is 'up'.\n    $E_6 = -J((-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1) + (+1)(-1)) = -J(1-1-1) = +J$.\n\n7.  **State (-1, +1, -1):** This is a cyclic permutation of the previous state.\n    $E_7 = -J((-1)(+1) + (+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1)) = -J(-1-1+1) = +J$.\n\n8.  **State (+1, -1, -1):** This is another cyclic permutation.\n    $E_8 = -J((+1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(+1)) = -J(-1+1-1) = +J$.\n\nNow, we can group the states by their energy levels.

The Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$H = -J \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} s_i s_{i+1}$$\nThis is a sum of energy contributions from $N-1$ adjacent spin pairs. Let's analyze the energy contribution from a single pair of adjacent spins, $(i, i+1)$, which is $E_{i, i+1} = -J s_i s_{i+1}$.\n\nWe are given that the coupling constant $J$ is negative ($J  0$). This means that the term $-J$ is positive. To minimize the energy contribution $E_{i, i+1}$, the product of the spins, $s_i s_{i+1}$, must be as negative as possible. Since each spin $s_i$ can only be $+1$ or $-1$, the product $s_i s_{i+1}$ can be either $+1$ (for parallel spins) or $-1$ (for anti-parallel spins).\n\nThe minimum possible value for the product $s_i s_{i+1}$ is $-1$. This occurs when adjacent spins are anti-parallel, i.e., $s_i = -s_{i+1}$.\nThe minimum possible energy for a single bond is therefore:\n$$E_{i, i+1, \\text{min}} = -J (-1) = J$$\nSince $J$ is a negative constant, this represents the lowest possible (most negative) energy for the bond.\n\nThe total energy $H$ is the sum of these $N-1$ bond energies. To obtain the absolute minimum total energy for the system (the ground state energy, $E_0$), we must minimize the energy of every single bond simultaneously. Because the chain has open boundary conditions, the spins are not constrained by a periodic loop (i.e., there is no interaction between $s_N$ and $s_1$). This lack of frustration allows us to set all bond energies to their minimum value independently.\n\nThus, for the ground state, we must have $s_i s_{i+1} = -1$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $N-1$.\nThe ground state energy $E_0$ is the sum of the minimum energies of all $N-1$ bonds:\n$$E_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} E_{i, i+1, \\text{min}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} J = (N-1)J$$\n\nNext, we determine the ground state degeneracy, $g_0$, which is the number of distinct spin configurations that produce this ground state energy. A configuration is a ground state if and only if all adjacent spins are anti-aligned ($s_i s_{i+1}=-1$ for all $i$). This means the spins must form a perfectly alternating pattern.\n\nLet's find all such patterns. We can freely choose the orientation of the first spin, $s_1$.\n1.  If we choose $s_1 = +1$, the condition $s_1 s_2 = -1$ forces $s_2 = -1$. Then, $s_2 s_3 = -1$ forces $s_3 = +1$. This continues down the chain, uniquely determining the entire configuration as: $(+1, -1, +1, -1, \\dots)$.\n2.  If we choose $s_1 = -1$, the condition $s_1 s_2 = -1$ forces $s_2 = +1$. Then, $s_2 s_3 = -1$ forces $s_3 = -1$, and so on. This also uniquely determines the entire configuration as: $(-1, +1, -1, +1, \\dots)$.\n\nThese two states are the only possible configurations where all adjacent spins are anti-aligned. They are distinct from each other. Therefore, there are exactly two ground state configurations.
