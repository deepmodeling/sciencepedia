This problem extends the concept from a binary system to a hypothetical three-state system, or 'trit', forcing us to work from the first principle of statistical entropy.

A single trit can exist in one of three distinct, equally probable states, which we can label as '0', '1', and '2'.\n\nA crucial operation in any computational cycle is the 'reset' or 'erasure' process, where a memory element, regardless of its initial state, is forced into a known, default state. For this trit-based system, the reset operation takes a trit from its current state (which could be '0', '1', or '2') and deterministically sets it to the state '0'.\n\nThis process is performed isothermally, with the device maintained at a constant absolute temperature $T$.

This minimum work is dictated by the change in the system's entropy, a principle established by Rolf Landauer. The minimum work, $W_{\\text{min}}$, that must be done on the system is related to the change in its statistical (Gibbs) entropy, $\\Delta S$, by the formula:\n$$W_{\\text{min}} = -T \\Delta S$$\nwhere $T$ is the absolute temperature of the thermal reservoir. The change in entropy is $\\Delta S = S_{\\text{final}} - S_{\\text{initial}}$. We must calculate the initial and final entropies of the two-bit memory cell.\n\nFirst, let's determine the initial entropy, $S_{\\text{initial}}$. The system is in one of two possible microstates ('01' or '10') with equal probability. The number of accessible microstates is $\\Omega_{\\text{initial}} = 2$. For a system with $\\Omega$ equally probable microstates, the statistical entropy is given by the Boltzmann entropy formula:\n$$S = k_B \\ln(\\Omega)$$\nApplying this to our initial state:\n$$S_{\\text{initial}} = k_B \\ln(\\Omega_{\\text{initial}}) = k_B \\ln(2)$$\n\nNext, we determine the final entropy, $S_{\\text{final}}$. The system is reset to the single, well-defined state '00'. In this case, there is only one possible microstate that the system can occupy. The number of accessible microstates in the final configuration is $\\Omega_{\\text{final}} = 1$.\nThe entropy of this final state is therefore:\n$$S_{\\text{final}} = k_B \\ln(\\Omega_{\\text{final}}) = k_B \\ln(1) = 0$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in entropy of the system during the reset process:\n$$\\Delta S = S_{\\text{final}} - S_{\\text{initial}} = 0 - k_B \\ln(2) = -k_B \\ln(2)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this change in entropy into the formula for the minimum work done on the system.\n$$W_{\\text{min}} = -T \\Delta S = -T(-k_B \\ln(2))$$\n$$W_{\\text{min}} = k_B T \\ln(2)$$\n\nThis result is the minimum work required to erase the one bit of information contained in the correlated two-bit system. Although the system has two physical bits, the strong anti-correlation reduces its initial state space from four possibilities ('00', '01', '10', '11') to just two, meaning it only holds one bit of uncertainty ($log_2(2)=1$) which is erased during the reset.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k_B T \\ln(2)}$$", "id": "1975857"}]}
