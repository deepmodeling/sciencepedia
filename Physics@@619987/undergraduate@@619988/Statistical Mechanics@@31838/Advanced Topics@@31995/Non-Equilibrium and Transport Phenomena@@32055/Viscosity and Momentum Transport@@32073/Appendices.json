This exercise challenges us to consider why shear viscosity, a defining property of fluids in our three-dimensional world, simply cannot exist in a one-dimensional system [@problem_id:2015784]. By dissecting this hypothetical scenario, we can isolate the indispensable role of transverse momentum transport, which is the absolute core of the shear viscosity phenomenon.", "problem": "Consider an idealized gas composed of point-like particles, where all particles are strictly confined to move along a single straight line (the x-axis). In a standard three-dimensional fluid, the coefficient of shear viscosity, $\\eta$, connects the shear stress $\\tau_{yx}$ to the gradient of the flow velocity. The shear stress $\\tau_{yx}$ is the drag force in the x-direction per unit area on a surface whose normal vector points in the y-direction. The relationship is given by the equation $\\tau_{yx} = -\\eta \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}$, where $u_x$ is the average flow velocity in the x-direction.

In a 1D gas, elastic collisions between particles only allow them to exchange velocities, which is a process that conserves total momentum and kinetic energy and therefore cannot lead to the dissipation required for viscosity.\n\nB. The concept of \"layers\" of fluid moving at different speeds is ill-defined in one dimension, as any position on the line is equivalent, making it impossible to establish a velocity gradient.\n\nC. Shear viscosity requires the transport of momentum in a direction perpendicular to the flow itself. Since particles are confined to a single line, they cannot move in any perpendicular direction to transport momentum between different conceptual flow streams.\n\nD. A 1D gas has only one translational degree of freedom. According to the equipartition theorem, this is insufficient to store the thermal energy that would be generated by viscous dissipation.\n\nE. Any pressure variations in the gas can only create forces along the line of motion (normal forces). By definition, shear forces must be tangential, a concept that cannot be realized in a 1D system.", "solution": "The problem asks for the fundamental physical reason why a one-dimensional gas has zero shear viscosity. To answer this, we must analyze the microscopic origin of shear viscosity and see how it applies, or fails to apply, to a 1D system.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Microscopic Origin of Shear Viscosity**\n\nShear viscosity is a transport phenomenon. Imagine a fluid where the bulk flow is in the x-direction, but the speed of this flow, $u_x$, varies with the perpendicular coordinate, $y$. This means we have a velocity gradient $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}$.\n\nDue to their random thermal motion, particles in the fluid are constantly moving in all directions, including the y-direction. A particle at a certain position $y_1$ has, on average, an x-momentum corresponding to the flow velocity $u_x(y_1)$. If this particle, due to its random motion, travels in the y-direction to a new position $y_2$, it carries its x-momentum with it.\n\nIf the flow at $y_2$ is slower (i.e., $u_x(y_2) < u_x(y_1)$), the arrival of this particle from the faster layer will impart extra x-momentum to the layer at $y_2$, effectively speeding it up. Conversely, a particle moving from the slower layer at $y_2$ to the faster layer at $y_1$ will slow it down.\n\nThis continuous exchange of x-momentum across planes of constant $y$ constitutes a flux of x-momentum in the y-direction. A flux of momentum is equivalent to a force per unit area, or a stress. Since the force (the momentum transfer) is in the x-direction and acts across a surface with its normal in the y-direction, this is a shear stress, $\\tau_{yx}$. The coefficient of shear viscosity, $\\eta$, is the proportionality constant that relates this stress to the velocity gradient that causes it: $\\tau_{yx} = -\\eta \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply this Understanding to the 1D Gas**\n\nIn the one-dimensional gas described, all particles are constrained to move *only* along the x-axis. This means their velocity vectors have only an x-component; the y- and z-components of their velocity are always zero.\n\nLet's try to set up a shear flow. A shear flow would require a flow velocity $u_x$ that varies with a perpendicular direction, say $y$. However, for momentum transport to occur in the y-direction, particles must have a non-zero velocity component in the y-direction. In our 1D gas, this is explicitly forbidden. No particle can ever leave the x-axis to travel from one conceptual \"layer\" at a certain $y$ value to another.\n\nBecause there is no particle motion in any direction perpendicular to the x-axis, there can be no transport of any quantity (mass, energy, or momentum) in a perpendicular direction. The flux of x-momentum in the y-direction is therefore identically zero, meaning $\\tau_{yx} = 0$. Since this is true even if we could hypothetically impose a velocity gradient $\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} \\neq 0$, the only way for the equation $\\tau_{yx} = -\\eta \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}$ to hold is if the coefficient of shear viscosity $\\eta$ is zero.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Given Options**\n\n*   **A:** This is incorrect. Viscous dissipation in 3D gases also arises from microscopically elastic collisions. Dissipation refers to the conversion of ordered macroscopic kinetic energy (the flow) into disordered microscopic kinetic energy (thermal energy), a process which relies on collisions to thermalize the momentum. The type of collision is not the limiting factor here.\n\n*   **B:** This is incorrect. It is possible to establish a velocity gradient *along* the line of motion, i.e., $\\frac{d u_x}{dx} \\neq 0$. For instance, one could inject fast particles at one end and remove them at the other. The problem is not the impossibility of a gradient, but the impossibility of the perpendicular transport required for *shear*.\n\n*   **C:** This is the correct statement. It precisely identifies the missing ingredient for shear viscosity: the ability of particles to move in a direction perpendicular to the flow to transport momentum between layers. This is the most fundamental reason.\n\n*   **D:** This is incorrect. The equipartition theorem concerns the distribution of energy in a system at thermal equilibrium. Viscosity is a non-equilibrium transport property. While related, the number of degrees of freedom is not the direct cause. A 3D monatomic gas has only 3 translational degrees of freedom and has non-zero shear viscosity.\n\n*   **E:** This statement is true, but it is a consequence, not the most fundamental reason. Shear forces are indeed tangential, and such forces don't exist in a pure 1D system. But the question asks *why* they don't exist. The reason is the lack of a microscopic mechanism to generate them. Option C provides that microscopic explanation: without perpendicular momentum transport, there can be no tangential force on a conceptual surface. Therefore, C is more fundamental than E.\n\nConclusion: The inability of particles to move in a direction perpendicular to the primary axis of motion means the mechanism for momentum transport that gives rise to shear viscosity is absent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2015784"}, {"introduction": "In our final practice, we push the boundaries of the theory to explore a more exotic system: an ultra-relativistic gas.
