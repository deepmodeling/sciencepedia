At time $t=0$, the surface of the wafer at position $x=0$ is exposed to a vapor that maintains a constant concentration of dopant atoms, denoted as $C_0$. These atoms then diffuse into the bulk of the wafer, which can be modeled as a one-dimensional, semi-infinite medium for $x \\ge 0$.

The governing equation is Fick's second law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe boundary and initial conditions are:\n1.  $C(x, 0) = 0$ for $x > 0$ (initially pure wafer).\n2.  $C(0, t) = C_0$ for $t > 0$ (constant surface concentration).\n3.  $C(x \\to \\infty, t) = 0$ (semi-infinite medium).\n\nThe parameters governing the concentration $C$ are $x$, $t$, $D$, and $C_0$. The concentration $C$ has the same units as $C_0$. The other variables have dimensions of length $L$ (for $x$), time $T$ (for $t$), and $L^2/T$ (for $D$). To form a dimensionless group from $x$, $t$, and $D$, we can see that the combination $\\frac{x^2}{Dt}$ is dimensionless. Therefore, the solution must be of the form of $C_0$ multiplied by a function of a dimensionless variable $\\eta$ which is proportional to $x/\\sqrt{Dt}$.\n$$\n\\frac{C(x,t)}{C_0} = f\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $f$ is a universal function determined by the diffusion equation and boundary conditions. The exact form of $f$ is the complementary error function, $f(z) = \\text{erfc}(z/2)$, but we do not need to know this to solve the problem. All we need is the knowledge that the concentration, when normalized by $C_0$, depends only on the specific combination of variables $\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{Dt}}$.\n\nIn the first experiment, we are given that at time $t_1$ and position $x_1$, the concentration is $C_1$.
