In this framework, we describe the gas as a two-temperature system to account for the different rates at which translational and rotational energies equilibrate during rapid processes.\n\nConsider a dilute diatomic gas with an average number density $n$ and initial equilibrium temperature $T$. The molecules possess translational and rotational degrees of freedom, with corresponding constant-volume heat capacities per molecule of $c_{v,t}$ and $c_{v,r}$, respectively. Vibrational modes are considered frozen.\n\nThe state of the gas under non-equilibrium conditions, such as a uniform expansion or compression, is characterized by a distinct translational temperature $T_t$ and rotational temperature $T_r$. The dynamics of this system are governed by the following principles:\n\n1.  The mechanical pressure, $\\bar{P}$, exerted by the gas is determined solely by the kinetic energy of translational motion: $\\bar{P} = n k_B T_t$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n2.  The total internal energy per molecule, $E$, is the sum of its translational and rotational parts: $E = E_t + E_r = c_{v,t} T_t + c_{v,r} T_r$.

The corresponding thermodynamic equilibrium pressure is $P_{eq} = n k_B T_{thermo}$.\n3.  The work done during a volume change, associated with a velocity divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$, directly alters only the translational energy of the molecules. The change in total internal energy per molecule is given by the first law of thermodynamics, $dE = -\\bar{P} d(1/n)$.\n4.
