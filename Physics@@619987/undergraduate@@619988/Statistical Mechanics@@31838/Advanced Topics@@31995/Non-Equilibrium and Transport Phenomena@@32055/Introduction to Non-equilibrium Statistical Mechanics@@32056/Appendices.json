The train moves at a constant velocity $v$. At this speed, the dominant dissipative force is not air resistance, but a constant magnetic drag force, denoted by $F_{\\text{drag}}$, which arises from eddy currents induced in the metallic guideway. To maintain the constant velocity, the train's propulsion system provides a perfectly matched forward thrust. The energy dissipated by the magnetic drag is continuously transferred as heat to the guideway. The guideway is large enough to be modeled as a thermal reservoir, maintaining a constant, uniform temperature $T$.\n\nConsider the combined system of the train and the guideway as it operates in this steady state.

In steady motion, the propulsion thrust exactly balances the drag, so the drag force does work on the train at a rate equal in magnitude to the mechanical power supplied by the propulsion system. The instantaneous power dissipated by the drag is\n$$\nP_{\\text{drag}} = F_{\\text{drag}}\\, v.\n$$\nThis dissipated mechanical power appears as heat in the guideway.

In steady operation, the trainâ€™s macroscopic state is constant, and taking the propulsion conversion to be ideal for this analysis, there is no compensating negative entropy flow within the combined system. Therefore, by the second law for a closed system, the total entropy production rate of the combined system equals the internal entropy increase rate, which is entirely due to the heat deposited in the guideway:\n$$\n\\dot{S}_{\\text{prod}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{drag}}\\, v}{T}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{F_{\\text{drag}}\\, v}{T}}$$", "id": "1972444"}, {"introduction": "Having explored entropy production from a macroscopic viewpoint, we now turn to the microscopic world to understand the origins of transport phenomena like diffusion.
