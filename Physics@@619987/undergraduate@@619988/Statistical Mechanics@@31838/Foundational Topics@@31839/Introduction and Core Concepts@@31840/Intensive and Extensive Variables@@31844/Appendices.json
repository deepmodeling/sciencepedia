The setup consists of two identical, rigid containers, labeled System A and System B, separated by a removable, insulating wall. Each container holds exactly one mole of the same monatomic ideal gas. Initially, both systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other at a temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. Each container has a volume $V$.\n\nThe physicist then removes the partition separating the two containers, allowing them to merge into a single larger system, called System C. This process is done in a way that no heat is exchanged with the surroundings and no work is done. The combined system C now contains two moles of the ideal gas in a total volume of $2V$ and is allowed to reach a new equilibrium state, which is found to be at the same temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.\n\nConsider the following four physical quantities:\n(i) The molar kinetic energy, defined as the total translational kinetic energy of the gas divided by the number of moles.\n(ii) The volume of the container.\n(iii) The particle density, defined as the number of gas particles per unit volume.\n(iv) The ideal gas constant, $R$.\n\nA property is called **extensive** if its value for the combined system is the sum of its values for the individual systems.

Consider two identical subsystems A and B, each with one mole of a monatomic ideal gas at temperature $T$, pressure $P$, and volume $V$, which are combined into system C with $2$ moles and volume $2V$ at the same $T$ and $P$.\n\nFor (i), the molar kinetic energy is defined as the total translational kinetic energy divided by the number of moles.

Thus (iii) is intensive.\n\nFor (iv), the ideal gas constant $R$ is a universal constant independent of system size or composition; it neither adds nor changes upon combining systems, so it is intensive.\n\nTherefore, the classifications are: (i) intensive, (ii) extensive, (iii) intensive, (iv) intensive, corresponding to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1971008"}, {"introduction": "The classification of properties is more than just a labeling exercise; it has profound mathematical consequences for a system's behavior. In thermodynamics, the extensivity of fundamental potentials like internal energy, $U(S, V, N)$, constrains the relationships between intensive variables.
