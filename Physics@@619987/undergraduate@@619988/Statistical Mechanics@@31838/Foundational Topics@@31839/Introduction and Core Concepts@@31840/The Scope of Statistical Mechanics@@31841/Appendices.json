This practice [@problem_id:2008447] challenges you to think like a statistical physicist, reframing this everyday phenomenon in terms of probabilities and the vast number of available microscopic configurations, or microstates. By analyzing this simple scenario, you will uncover the statistical principle that drives systems toward their most probable state: thermal equilibrium.", "problem": "A small block of metal with an initial internal energy $U_S$ and temperature $T_S$ is placed into a large reservoir of fluid that has an initial internal energy $U_R$ and temperature $T_R$. The initial temperatures are such that $T_R > T_S$. The combined system (block + reservoir) is thermally isolated from the rest of the universe. The block is considered the 'system' and the fluid is considered the 'bath' or 'reservoir'. Let $\\Omega_S(U_S)$ be the number of microstates accessible to the block when it has energy $U_S$, and $\\Omega_R(U_R)$ be the number of microstates accessible to the reservoir when it has energy $U_R$. The total energy of the combined system is constant, $U_{total} = U_S + U_R$. Eventually, the block and reservoir reach a state of thermal equilibrium.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of this process from the perspective of statistical mechanics?\n\nA. Energy spontaneously flows from the reservoir to the block because this specific direction of energy transfer leads to an increase in the total number of accessible microstates for the combined system, $\\Omega_{total} = \\Omega_S \\times \\Omega_R$. The system reaches equilibrium when this total number of microstates is maximized.\n\nB. The process is governed by the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics, which states that heat must flow from the hotter body to the colder body. The flow continues until the temperatures are equal, at which point the net heat transfer becomes zero.\n\nC. The atoms of the reservoir have a higher average kinetic energy than the atoms of the block. Through collisions at the interface, this \"excess\" kinetic energy is transferred from the reservoir atoms to the block atoms until the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the block is equal to the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the reservoir.\n\nD. The reservoir transfers energy to the block until the internal energy of the block, $U_S$, becomes equal to the internal energy of the reservoir, $U_R$. At this point, the system is in equilibrium because the energy is distributed evenly.\n\nE. At thermal equilibrium, the total entropy of the universe is maximized. This means the block and reservoir exchange energy until the entropy of the block equals the entropy of the reservoir.", "solution": "We model the combined (block + reservoir) as an isolated system with fixed total energy $U_{\\text{total}}=U_{S}+U_{R}$. In the microcanonical description, the total number of accessible microstates is the product\n$$\n\\Omega_{\\text{total}}(U_{S})=\\Omega_{S}(U_{S})\\,\\Omega_{R}(U_{\\text{total}}-U_{S}),\n$$\nwith $U_{R}=U_{\\text{total}}-U_{S}$.

Hence increasing $U_{S}$ (i.e., transferring energy from reservoir to block) increases $S_{\\text{total}}$, so energy spontaneously flows from the reservoir to the block until $T_{S}=T_{R}$, at which point $S_{\\text{total}}$ is maximized.\n\nInterpretation of the options:\n- A correctly states the statistical-mechanical principle: energy flows in the direction that increases the total multiplicity $\\Omega_{\\text{total}}=\\Omega_{S}\\Omega_{R}$ (equivalently maximizes $S_{\\text{total}}$), and equilibrium corresponds to the maximum of $\\Omega_{\\text{total}}$.\n- B incorrectly attributes the direction of heat flow to the Zeroth Law; the Zeroth Law concerns transitivity of thermal equilibrium, while the direction of spontaneous heat flow is a consequence of entropy maximization.\n- C provides a kinetic picture that is not generally valid for arbitrary systems and is not the core statistical-mechanics criterion.\n- D is false in general; equilibrium does not require $U_{S}=U_{R}$.\n- E misstates the equilibrium condition; equilibrium requires equality of temperatures (i.e., equality of $\\partial S/\\partial U$), not equality of entropies.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statistical-mechanical description is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2008447"}, {"introduction": "The laws of thermodynamics appear deterministic and precise when applied to macroscopic objects, but what happens at the nanoscale?
