This exercise introduces the more realistic concept of static friction, which creates a range of stable positions for a piston separating two gases. You will apply the ideal gas law and force balance conditions to determine the boundaries of this equilibrium range, providing a more nuanced understanding of mechanical stability [@problem_id:2011661].", "problem": "A horizontal, thermally insulated cylinder of fixed total internal volume $V_{tot}$ and uniform cross-sectional area $A$ is divided into two compartments by a thin, movable, thermally conducting piston. Compartment 1 contains $N_1$ moles of a monatomic ideal gas, and compartment 2 contains $N_2$ moles of a different monatomic ideal gas. The entire system is in contact with a thermal reservoir, maintaining a constant absolute temperature $T$ throughout. The piston experiences a maximum static friction force of magnitude $f_s$ with the cylinder walls. This means the piston will remain stationary if the magnitude of the net force exerted on it by the gases is less than or equal to $f_s$. Due to this static friction, there is a range of possible equilibrium positions for the piston.\n\nLet $V_1$ be the volume of compartment 1. Determine the lower bound, $V_{1,min}$, and the upper bound, $V_{1,max}$, of the range of volumes for $V_1$ for which the piston can be in mechanical equilibrium. Express your answers as two separate closed-form analytic expressions in terms of $V_{tot}$, $N_1$, $N_2$, $A$, $f_s$, the temperature $T$, and the ideal gas constant $R$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the range of volumes $[V_{1,min}, V_{1,max}]$ for compartment 1 where the piston remains in mechanical equilibrium. The system is in thermal equilibrium at a constant temperature $T$.\n\nFirst, we express the pressures in the two compartments, $P_1$ and $P_2$, using the ideal gas law, $PV=NRT$. Let $V_1$ be the volume of compartment 1. Since the total volume is $V_{tot}$, the volume of compartment 2 is $V_2 = V_{tot} - V_1$.\nThe pressures are:\n$$ P_1 = \\frac{N_1 R T}{V_1} $$\n$$ P_2 = \\frac{N_2 R T}{V_2} = \\frac{N_2 R T}{V_{tot} - V_1} $$\n\nThe forces exerted by the gases on the piston of area $A$ are $F_1 = P_1 A$ and $F_2 = P_2 A$. The net force on the piston due to the gas pressures is $F_{net} = F_1 - F_2$, taking the direction from compartment 1 to compartment 2 as positive.\nThe condition for the piston to remain in mechanical equilibrium (i.e., not to move) is that the magnitude of this net force must be less than or equal to the maximum static friction force $f_s$:\n$$ |F_{net}| \\leq f_s $$\n$$ |P_1 A - P_2 A| \\leq f_s $$\n$$ \\left| \\frac{N_1 R T A}{V_1} - \\frac{N_2 R T A}{V_{tot} - V_1} \\right| \\leq f_s $$\n\nThis inequality defines the entire range of equilibrium volumes. The boundaries of this range, $V_{1,min}$ and $V_{1,max}$, are found when the system is at the limit of equilibrium, i.e., when the equality holds:\n$$ \\left| \\frac{N_1 R T A}{V_1} - \\frac{N_2 R T A}{V_{tot} - V_1} \\right| = f_s $$\nThis gives two separate equations:\n1.  $P_1 A - P_2 A = f_s$\n2.  $P_1 A - P_2 A = -f_s$\n\nLet's analyze these two cases.\n\nCase 1: $P_1 A - P_2 A = f_s$. This means $P_1 > P_2$. A higher pressure in compartment 1 corresponds to a smaller volume $V_1$. Thus, the solution to this equation will yield the lower bound, $V_{1,min}$.\n$$ \\frac{N_1 R T}{V_1} - \\frac{N_2 R T}{V_{tot} - V_1} = \\frac{f_s}{A} $$\nTo solve for $V_1$, we can rearrange this equation into a quadratic form. Multiplying by $V_1(V_{tot} - V_1) A$:\n$$ N_1 R T A (V_{tot} - V_1) - N_2 R T A V_1 = f_s V_1 (V_{tot} - V_1) $$\n$$ N_1 R T A V_{tot} - (N_1+N_2) R T A V_1 = f_s V_{tot} V_1 - f_s V_1^2 $$\nRearranging into the standard quadratic form $ax^2+bx+c=0$ for $V_1$:\n$$ f_s V_1^2 - (f_s V_{tot} + (N_1+N_2) R T A) V_1 + N_1 R T A V_{tot} = 0 $$\nSolving this for $V_1$ using the quadratic formula $V_1 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ V_1 = \\frac{(f_s V_{tot} + (N_1+N_2) R T A) \\pm \\sqrt{(f_s V_{tot} + (N_1+N_2) R T A)^2 - 4 f_s (N_1 R T A V_{tot})}}{2 f_s} $$\nWe expect $V_{1,min}$ to be a physically reasonable volume. In the limit of zero friction ($f_s \\to 0$), the volume should approach the frictionless equilibrium value $V_{1,eq} = \\frac{N_1}{N_1+N_2}V_{tot}$. The '-' sign in the numerator gives the smaller root which corresponds to the physical solution for $V_{1,min}$.\n$$ V_{1,min} = \\frac{A}{2f_s} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{f_s V_{tot}}{A} + (N_1+N_2)RT\\right) - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{f_s V_{tot}}{A} + (N_1+N_2)RT\\right)^2 - \\frac{4f_s N_1 RT V_{tot}}{A}} \\right] $$\n\nCase 2: $P_1 A - P_2 A = -f_s$. This means $P_1 < P_2$. A lower pressure in compartment 1 corresponds to a larger volume $V_1$. The solution here will give the upper bound, $V_{1,max}$.\n$$ \\frac{N_1 R T}{V_1} - \\frac{N_2 R T}{V_{tot} - V_1} = -\\frac{f_s}{A} $$\nFollowing the same algebraic steps as before:\n$$ N_1 R T A (V_{tot} - V_1) - N_2 R T A V_1 = -f_s V_1 (V_{tot} - V_1) $$\n$$ N_1 R T A V_{tot} - (N_1+N_2) R T A V_1 = -f_s V_{tot} V_1 + f_s V_1^2 $$\nRearranging into a quadratic equation for $V_1$:\n$$ f_s V_1^2 + ((N_1+N_2) R T A - f_s V_{tot}) V_1 - N_1 R T A V_{tot} = 0 $$\nSolving for $V_1$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$ V_1 = \\frac{-((N_1+N_2) R T A - f_s V_{tot}) \\pm \\sqrt{((N_1+N_2) R T A - f_s V_{tot})^2 - 4 f_s (-N_1 R T A V_{tot})}}{2 f_s} $$\nTo find the larger, physical root corresponding to $V_{1,max}$, we must choose the '+' sign.
