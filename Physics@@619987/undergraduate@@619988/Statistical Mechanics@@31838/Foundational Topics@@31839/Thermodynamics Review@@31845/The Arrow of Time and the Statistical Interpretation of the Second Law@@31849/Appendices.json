This exercise [@problem_id:1995405] provides a concrete application of Ludwig Boltzmann's statistical definition of entropy, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. By modeling the mixing of two distinct particle types on a lattice, you will directly calculate the increase in the number of accessible microstates ($\\Omega$) and the corresponding change in entropy. This practice demonstrates how the irreversible tendency towards mixing is fundamentally a statistical phenomenon—the system simply moves into the overwhelmingly more probable macroscopic state.", "problem": "A simplified model for a nanoscale memory device consists of a one-dimensional lattice with a total of 100 discrete sites. A thin, removable partition divides the lattice into two equal compartments, 'Left' and 'Right', each containing 50 sites. The device stores information using two types of non-interacting particles, denoted as type 'A' and type 'B'. Each lattice site can be occupied by at most one particle.\n\nInitially, the Left compartment contains 10 particles of type A, and the Right compartment contains 10 particles of type B. The partition is then removed, allowing the particles to move freely across all 100 sites of the lattice.\n\nAssuming all possible arrangements of particles (microstates) are equally likely, calculate the total change in the Boltzmann entropy of the system after the partition is removed. The relationship between entropy $S$ and the number of accessible microstates $\\Omega$ is given by Boltzmann's formula, $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$.\n\nUse the value of the Boltzmann constant $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}$.\n\nExpress your final answer in joules per kelvin (J/K), rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "We model microstates as distinct site-occupancy patterns because particles of the same type are indistinguishable and each site can hold at most one particle.
