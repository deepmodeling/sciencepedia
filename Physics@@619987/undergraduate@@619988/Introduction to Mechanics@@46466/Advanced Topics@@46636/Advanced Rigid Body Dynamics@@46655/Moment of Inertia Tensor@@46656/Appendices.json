Having one principal moment zero while the others are not zero contradicts spherical symmetry unless all are zero, which reduces to A.\n- E is false in general.

Let's denote the rod along the x-axis as Rod 1 and the rod along the y-axis as Rod 2. Since the rods are uniform, the center of mass of Rod 1 is at its geometric center, $(\\frac{L}{2}, 0, 0)$, and its mass is $M$.

Since $I_{xy, \\text{vertex}} = 0$, we have:\n$0 = I_{xy, \\text{CM}} - (2M)(\\frac{L}{4})(\\frac{L}{4}) \\implies I_{xy, \\text{CM}} = \\frac{2ML^2}{16} = \\frac{ML^2}{8}$.\nSince the body is in the xy-plane, $a_z=0$, so $I_{xz,CM} = 0$ and $I_{yz,CM} = 0$.\n\nThe moment of inertia tensor about the center of mass is:\n$\\mathbf{I}_{CM} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{5ML^2}{24} & \\frac{ML^2}{8} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{ML^2}{8} & \\frac{5ML^2}{24} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{5ML^2}{12} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nTo make the matrix easier to handle, we factor out $\\frac{ML^2}{24}$.

We find them by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{I}_{CM} - I \\cdot \\mathbf{1}) = 0$.\nLet's factor out $k = \\frac{ML^2}{24}$ and find eigenvalues $\\lambda = I/k$.\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 5-\\lambda & 3 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 5-\\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 10-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$(10-\\lambda) \\left[ (5-\\lambda)^2 - (3)(3) \\right] = 0$\nOne eigenvalue is immediately $\\lambda_3 = 10$.\nThe other two come from $(5-\\lambda)^2 - 9 = 0$, which gives $(5-\\lambda) = \\pm 3$.\n$\\lambda_1 = 5 - 3 = 2$\n$\\lambda_2 = 5 + 3 = 8$\n\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2, \\lambda_2=8, \\lambda_3=10$. Now we convert them back to principal moments of inertia by multiplying by $k = \\frac{ML^2}{24}$.\n$I_1 = \\lambda_1 k = 2 \\left(\\frac{ML^2}{24}\\right) = \\frac{ML^2}{12}$\n$I_2 = \\lambda_2 k = 8 \\left(\\frac{ML^2}{24}\\right) = \\frac{ML^2}{3}$\n$I_3 = \\lambda_3 k = 10 \\left(\\frac{ML^2}{24}\\right) = \\frac{5ML^2}{12}$\n\n**Step 4: Order the Principal Moments**\nWe are asked to present the moments in ascending order.\n$I_1 = \\frac{1}{12} ML^2$\n$I_2 = \\frac{4}{12} ML^2 = \\frac{1}{3} ML^2$\n$I_3 = \\frac{5}{12} ML^2$\n\nClearly, $\\frac{1}{12} < \\frac{4}{12} < \\frac{5}{12}$.\nSo the ordered principal moments are $\\frac{ML^2}{12}$, $\\frac{ML^2}{3}$, and $\\frac{5ML^2}{12}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{ML^2}{12}, \\frac{ML^2}{3}, \\frac{5ML^2}{12}}$$", "id": "2201905"}]}
