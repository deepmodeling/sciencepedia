This is a classic demonstration of the Tennis Racket Theorem.\n\nFirst, we must identify the principal axes and their corresponding moments of inertia for the uniform rectangular block. The principal axes pass through the center of mass and are aligned with the edges of lengths $a, b,$ and $c$. Let the moments of inertia about these axes be $I_a, I_b$, and $I_c$, respectively. For a uniform rectangular block of mass $M$ and dimensions $(a,b,c)$, the principal moments of inertia are given by:\n$$I_a = \\frac{M}{12}(b^2 + c^2)$$\n$$I_b = \\frac{M}{12}(a^2 + c^2)$$\n$$I_c = \\frac{M}{12}(a^2 + b^2)$$\n\nNext, we substitute the given side lengths $a = 0.20$ m, $b = 0.30$ m, and $c = 0.40$ m to determine the relative order of the moments of inertia. The common factor of $M/12$ can be ignored for comparison.\n$$I_a \\propto (0.30)^2 + (0.40)^2 = 0.09 + 0.16 = 0.25$$\n$$I_b \\propto (0.20)^2 + (0.40)^2 = 0.04 + 0.16 = 0.20$$\n$$I_c \\propto (0.20)^2 + (0.30)^2 = 0.04 + 0.09 = 0.13$$\nBy comparing these values, we have the ordering $I_c < I_b < I_a$. Therefore, the axis $\\hat{e}_b$ corresponds to the intermediate principal moment of inertia, $I_b$. The axes $\\hat{e}_c$ and $\\hat{e}_a$ correspond to the minimum ($I_1 = I_c$) and maximum ($I_3 = I_a$) moments of inertia, respectively. So we have $I_1 = I_c$, $I_2 = I_b$, $I_3 = I_a$.\n\nThe problem states that the block is spun primarily about the intermediate axis, $\\hat{e}_b$. Let the angular velocity vector in the body-fixed frame of principal axes be $\\vec{\\omega} = (\\omega_c, \\omega_b, \\omega_a)$. The initial condition is that $\\omega_b \\approx \\omega_0$ and $\\omega_c, \\omega_a$ are small perturbations. Euler's equations for a rigid body are:\n$$I_c \\dot{\\omega}_c = (I_b - I_a) \\omega_b \\omega_a$$\n$$I_b \\dot{\\omega}_b = (I_a - I_c) \\omega_a \\omega_c$$\n$$I_a \\dot{\\omega}_a = (I_c - I_b) \\omega_c \\omega_b$$\n\nSince $\\omega_c$ and $\\omega_a$ are small, their product $\\omega_a \\omega_c$ is a second-order small quantity. Thus, the second equation gives $I_b \\dot{\\omega}_b \\approx 0$, which implies that the main component of angular velocity, $\\omega_b$, is approximately constant: $\\omega_b(t) \\approx \\omega_0$.\n\nWe can now linearize the first and third equations for the small perturbations $\\omega_c$ and $\\omega_a$:\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_c = \\frac{I_b - I_a}{I_c} \\omega_0 \\omega_a $$\n$$ \\dot{\\omega}_a = \\frac{I_c - I_b}{I_a} \\omega_0 \\omega_c $$\n\nThis is a system of two coupled first-order linear differential equations. To solve it, we can differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n$$ \\ddot{\\omega}_c = \\frac{I_b - I_a}{I_c} \\omega_0 \\dot{\\omega}_a $$\nNow, substitute the expression for $\\dot{\\omega}_a$ from the second equation into this:\n$$ \\ddot{\\omega}_c = \\frac{I_b - I_a}{I_c} \\omega_0 \\left( \\frac{I_c - I_b}{I_a} \\omega_0 \\omega_c \\right) $$\n$$ \\ddot{\\omega}_c = \\left[ \\frac{(I_b - I_a)(I_c - I_b)}{I_c I_a} \\omega_0^2 \\right] \\omega_c $$\nThis is a second-order linear differential equation of the form $\\ddot{x} = k x$. The solution is exponential if the constant $k$ is positive. Let's check the sign of the term in the brackets. Since $I_c < I_b < I_a$, the term $(I_b - I_a)$ is negative, and the term $(I_c - I_b)$ is also negative. Their product is positive. Thus, the coefficient of $\\omega_c$ is positive, leading to exponential growth.\n\nThe equation is of the form $\\ddot{\\omega}_c = \\lambda^2 \\omega_c$, where $\\lambda$ is the exponential growth rate. By comparison, we have:\n$$ \\lambda^2 = \\frac{(I_b - I_a)(I_c - I_b)}{I_c I_a} \\omega_0^2 = \\frac{(I_a - I_b)(I_b - I_c)}{I_c I_a} \\omega_0^2 $$\nTaking the positive square root for the growth rate:\n$$ \\lambda = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{(I_a - I_b)(I_b - I_c)}{I_c I_a}} $$\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for the moments of inertia. The factor of $M/12$ will cancel out.\n$$ I_a - I_b = \\frac{M}{12}((b^2+c^2) - (a^2+c^2)) = \\frac{M}{12}(b^2 - a^2) $$\n$$ I_b - I_c = \\frac{M}{12}((a^2+c^2) - (a^2+b^2)) = \\frac{M}{12}(c^2 - b^2) $$\n$$ I_c I_a = \\left(\\frac{M}{12}\\right)^2 (a^2+b^2)(b^2+c^2) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{M}{12}(b^2 - a^2)\\right) \\left(\\frac{M}{12}(c^2 - b^2)\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{M}{12}\\right)^2 (a^2+b^2)(b^2+c^2)}} = \\omega_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{(b^2 - a^2)(c^2 - b^2)}{(a^2 + b^2)(b^2 + c^2)}} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values: $a=0.20$ m, $b=0.30$ m, $c=0.40$ m, and $\\omega_0=10.0$ rad/s.\n$$ a^2 = 0.04 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ b^2 = 0.09 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ c^2 = 0.16 \\text{ m}^2 $$\nThe terms in the expression for $\\lambda$ are:\n$$ b^2 - a^2 = 0.09 - 0.04 = 0.05 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ c^2 - b^2 = 0.16 - 0.09 = 0.07 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ a^2 + b^2 = 0.04 + 0.09 = 0.13 \\text{ m}^2 $$\n$$ b^2 + c^2 = 0.09 + 0.16 = 0.25 \\text{ m}^2 $$\nNow we can calculate $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = 10.0 \\text{ rad/s} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.05)(0.07)}{(0.13)(0.25)}} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 10.0 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0035}{0.0325}} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 10.0 \\times \\sqrt{0.1076923...} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 10.0 \\times 0.328165... \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 3.28165... \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\lambda = 3.28$ s$^{-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.28}$$", "id": "2225193"}, {"introduction": "Analytical solutions provide deep insight, but a numerical simulation can offer a uniquely intuitive feel for the physics.
