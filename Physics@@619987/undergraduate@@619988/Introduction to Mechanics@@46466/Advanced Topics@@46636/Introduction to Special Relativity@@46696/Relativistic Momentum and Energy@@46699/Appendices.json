As its speed increases, so do its relativistic total energy $E$ and its relativistic kinetic energy $K$.

The total relativistic energy $E$ is given by:\n$$E = \\gamma m_0 c^{2}$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light and $\\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, defined as:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$$\nThe relativistic kinetic energy $K$ is the difference between the total energy $E$ and the rest energy $E_0 = m_0 c^{2}$:\n$$K = E - E_0 = \\gamma m_0 c^{2} - m_0 c^{2} = (\\gamma - 1)m_0 c^{2}$$\nThe condition given in the problem is that the kinetic energy is one-third of the total energy:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{3}E$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $K$ and $E$ in terms of $\\gamma$, $m_0$, and $c$ into this condition:\n$$(\\gamma - 1)m_0 c^{2} = \\frac{1}{3}(\\gamma m_0 c^{2})$$\nSince the particle has a non-zero rest mass ($m_0 \\neq 0$) and $c$ is a constant, the term $m_0 c^{2}$ is non-zero and can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n$$\\gamma - 1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\gamma$$\nNow we solve this equation for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$.\n$$\\gamma - \\frac{1}{3}\\gamma = 1$$\n$$\\frac{2}{3}\\gamma = 1$$\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nNow that we have the value of the Lorentz factor, we can use its definition to find the speed $v$.\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$$\nSubstituting $\\gamma = 3/2$:\n$$\\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$$\nTo solve for $v$, we first square both sides of the equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}$$\n$$\\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}$$\nNext, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$1 - \\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} = \\frac{4}{9}$$\nNow, we isolate the term $\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}$:\n$$\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} = 1 - \\frac{4}{9}$$\n$$\\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}} = \\frac{9}{9} - \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\nFinally, we take the square root of both sides to find $v/c$. Since speed $v$ must be positive, we only consider the positive root.\n$$\\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{9}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}$$\nTherefore, the speed of the particle is:\n$$v = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}c$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{3}c}$$", "id": "2211687"}, {"introduction": "Having practiced with the basic definitions, let's explore one of their most profound consequences: the rapidly increasing energy cost of acceleration as an object approaches the speed of light.
