We begin with a familiar scenario: a ball bouncing under gravity.

The ball is subject to a constant downward gravitational acceleration $g$. Assume that air resistance is negligible and that all collisions between the ball and the floor are perfectly elastic. The state of the ball at any time can be described by a point in a two-dimensional phase space, with the vertical position $y$ (measured upwards from the floor) on the horizontal axis and the corresponding momentum $p$ on the vertical axis.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate description of the trajectory of the ball in this $(y, p)$ phase space?\n\nA. The trajectory is a single, closed ellipse, centered at some point $(y_c, 0)$.\n\nB. The trajectory consists of a series of connected semi-circular arcs.\n\nC. The trajectory consists of a series of identical parabolic arcs. Each arc starts at zero momentum at the maximum height and ends at the floor, where the momentum instantaneously jumps from a large negative value to its positive counterpart before the next arc begins.\n\nD.

The trajectory consists of a series of straight-line segments, representing the motion under constant acceleration.", "solution": "Let the vertical position be $y$ (upwards from the floor) and the vertical momentum be $p=m\\dot{y}$. During free flight (no contact with the floor), the motion is governed by Newtonâ€™s second law $m\\ddot{y}=-mg$, equivalently $\\dot{p}=m\\ddot{y}=-mg$, and by energy conservation with Hamiltonian\n$$\nH(y,p)=\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}+mgy=E,\n$$\na constant between collisions. The ball is dropped from rest at $y=h$, so initially $p=0$ and hence\n$$\nE=mgh.\n$$\nEliminating $E$ gives the phase-space relation during free flight:\n$$\n\\frac{p^{2}}{2m}+mgy=mgh \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad p^{2}=2m^{2}g\\,(h-y).\n$$\nThus, in the $(y,p)$ plane, the free-flight trajectory satisfies\n$$\np(y)=\\pm m\\sqrt{2g\\,(h-y)},\n$$\nwhich is a parabola symmetric about $p=0$, opening toward decreasing $y$.\n\nAt the floor, $y=0$.

The subsequent upward motion follows the same energy parabola on the $p>0$ branch until it reaches the turning point at $y=h$, where $p=0$. The process then repeats identically: from $(y,p)=(h,0)$ it follows the $p<0$ branch down to $(0,-m\\sqrt{2gh})$, undergoes the instantaneous vertical jump to $(0,+m\\sqrt{2gh})$, and follows the $p>0$ branch back to $(h,0)$.\n\nTherefore, the trajectory in $(y,p)$ consists of a series of identical parabolic arcs corresponding to $p^{2}=2m^{2}g\\,(h-y)$, each arc starting at $p=0$ at $y=h$ and ending at the floor $y=0$, where the momentum instantaneously jumps from a large negative value to its positive counterpart before the next arc begins.

This practice [@problem_id:2207222] challenges you to translate the geometry of a 'V-shaped' potential energy function directly into the geometric shape of the trajectories in phase space. It beautifully illustrates how the equation for conservation of energy, $E = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + U(x)$, serves as the master blueprint for drawing any phase portrait.", "problem": "A particle of mass $m$ is constrained to move in one dimension along the x-axis. The potential energy of the particle is given by the function $U(x) = c|x|$, where $c$ is a positive constant with appropriate units. This type of potential can serve as a simplified model for the restoring force on the tip of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) near its equilibrium position.\n\nConsider the motion of this particle for a fixed total energy $E > 0$. The state of the system at any time can be represented by a point in a two-dimensional phase space, with position $x$ as the abscissa and momentum $p$ as the ordinate.

The trajectories are open curves resembling hyperbolas, indicating the particle eventually escapes to infinity.", "solution": "The trajectory of a particle in phase space is determined by the conservation of total mechanical energy. The total energy $E$ is the sum of the kinetic energy $K$ and the potential energy $U(x)$.\n\nThe kinetic energy is given by $K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2$, which can be expressed in terms of the momentum $p=mv$ as $K = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$.\nThe potential energy is given as $U(x) = c|x|$.\n\nFor a conservative system, the total energy $E$ is constant along any given trajectory:\n$$E = K + U(x) = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + c|x|$$\n\nThis equation defines the relationship between the position $x$ and the momentum $p$ for a trajectory corresponding to a constant energy $E$. To analyze the shape of this curve in the $(x, p)$ phase plane, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $p^2$:\n$$p^2 = 2m(E - c|x|)$$\n\nFor the particle to be in a bound state, its momentum $p$ must be a real number, which means $p^2 \\ge 0$. This condition imposes a constraint on the possible values of $x$:\n$$E - c|x| \\ge 0$$\n$$|x| \\le \\frac{E}{c}$$\nThis shows that the motion is confined to the region $-\\frac{E}{c} \\le x \\le \\frac{E}{c}$. The points $x = \\pm E/c$ are the classical turning points where the momentum is zero. Since the motion is confined to a finite region of space for any positive energy $E$, the trajectories must be closed loops. This immediately rules out option E, which describes open, unbounded trajectories.\n\nTo determine the precise shape of these closed loops, we analyze the equation $p^2 = 2m(E - c|x|)$ by considering the two cases for the absolute value function $|x|$.\n\nCase 1: $x \\ge 0$\nIn this region, $|x| = x$, and the equation for the trajectory becomes:\n$$p^2 = 2m(E - cx) \\quad \\implies \\quad p^2 = -2mcx + 2mE$$\nThis is the equation of a parabola in the $(x,p)$ plane. Since $p$ is squared and $x$ is not, the axis of symmetry is the x-axis ($p=0$). The coefficient of the $x$ term, $-2mc$, is negative, so the parabola opens to the left.\n\nCase 2: $x < 0$\nIn this region, $|x| = -x$, and the equation for the trajectory becomes:\n$$p^2 = 2m(E - c(-x)) \\quad \\implies \\quad p^2 = 2mcx + 2mE$$\nThis is also the equation of a parabola with the x-axis as its axis of symmetry. The coefficient of the $x$ term, $2mc$, is positive, so the parabola opens to the right.\n\nThe complete phase trajectory is formed by joining these two parabolic segments. They meet on the p-axis, where $x=0$. At $x=0$, the momentum is given by $p^2 = 2m(E - 0) = 2mE$, so the intersection points are $(0, \\sqrt{2mE})$ and $(0, -\\sqrt{2mE})$.\n\nThe overall shape is a closed loop, symmetric about both the x-axis and the p-axis. It is composed of a parabolic arc for $x>0$ and another parabolic arc for $x<0$. Because the potential $U(x)=c|x|$ has a sharp \"V\" shape at $x=0$, the force $F = -dU/dx$ is discontinuous there. This discontinuity in force leads to a discontinuity in the slope of the trajectory in phase space. The derivative $dp/dx$ is different when approaching $x=0$ from the left versus from the right, creating \"sharp points\" or cusps on the momentum axis.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Circles are incorrect. This would require an equation of the form $p^2 + k x^2 = R^2$ where $k$ is a constant, which is not our equation.\nB. Ellipses are incorrect. They correspond to the simple harmonic oscillator potential, $U(x) \\propto x^2$, leading to an equation of the form $\\frac{p^2}{a^2} + \\frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nC. Rectangles are incorrect. They are characteristic of a particle in an infinite square well.\nD. This option correctly identifies that the trajectory is a closed loop made of two parabolic segments. It also correctly notes that they meet at sharp points on the momentum axis, which reflects the non-smooth nature of the potential at the origin. This matches our derivation.\nE. Open curves are incorrect, as the motion is bounded.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description of the phase trajectories is that they are closed loops, each composed of two distinct parabolic segments meeting at sharp points on the momentum axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2207222"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice employs a powerful method in physics: comparison.

The phase portrait of the SHO consists of a family of concentric ellipses, where the period of revolution along any trajectory is constant, regardless of its size.

The phase portraits of both systems consist of families of concentric ellipses. For the SHO, the trajectories are traversed at a constant rate. For the pendulum, the system moves slower along the trajectory as its angular displacement increases, but the overall period remains constant.\n\nC. For both systems, the period of revolution along a phase space trajectory increases as the total energy increases. The phase portraits for both consist of distorted ovals, departing from a simple elliptical shape for all but the lowest energies.\n\nD. The phase portrait of the pendulum consists of a family of concentric ellipses, where the period of revolution is constant. For the SHO, the trajectories become progressively more rectangular as the energy increases, reflecting the sharp turning points at maximum displacement.\n\nE. The phase portrait of the SHO consists of a family of concentric ellipses with a constant period of revolution. For the pendulum, the trajectories are distorted from an elliptical shape, and the period of revolution along these trajectories decreases as the energy and amplitude increase.", "solution": "We compare the two systems via their Hamiltonians and the resulting phase portraits and periods.\n\nFor the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO) with mass $m$ and spring constant $k$, the Hamiltonian is\n$$\nH_{\\text{SHO}}(x,p_{x})=\\frac{p_{x}^{2}}{2m}+\\frac{1}{2}k x^{2}.\n$$\nA trajectory of fixed energy $E$ satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{p_{x}^{2}}{2mE}+\\frac{k x^{2}}{2E}=1,\n$$\nwhich is the equation of an ellipse in the $(x,p_{x})$ plane.
