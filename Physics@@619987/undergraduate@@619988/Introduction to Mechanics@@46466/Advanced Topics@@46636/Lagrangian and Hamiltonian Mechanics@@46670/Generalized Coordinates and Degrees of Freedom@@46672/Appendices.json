The sculpture is displayed by balancing it on one of its edges on a large, flat, horizontal gallery floor. The edge of the cube is constrained to always remain in contact with the floor, but it can slide and pivot freely. To document the sculpture's state for an interactive virtual gallery, a programmer needs to know the minimum number of independent parameters required to uniquely define the position and orientation of the cube at any given moment. What is this number?", "solution": "A free rigid body in three-dimensional space has six degrees of freedom: three translational and three rotational. Let the horizontal floor be the plane given by $z=0$ in a world frame. Fix a particular body edge of the cube and denote its body-frame unit direction by $\\hat{u}$ and a chosen reference point on that edge (for example, its midpoint) by $p_{0}$. Let the pose of the cube be given by a rotation $R \\in \\mathrm{SO}(3)$ and a translation $t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nThe condition that the specified body edge lies entirely within the plane $z=0$ can be imposed by the following two independent scalar constraints:\n1) The direction of the edge must be parallel to the plane, i.e.,\n$$(R\\hat{u}) \\cdot \\hat{z} = 0,$$\nwhich removes one rotational degree of freedom (it restricts the image of $\\hat{u}$ to be horizontal).\n\n2) A point on the edge must lie in the plane, i.e.,\n$$\\hat{z} \\cdot \\bigl(t + R p_{0}\\bigr) = 0,$$\nwhich removes one translational degree of freedom (it fixes the vertical position so that the edge is at $z=0$).\n\nThese two independent scalar equalities reduce the six-dimensional configuration space by two, leaving\n$$6 - 2 = 4$$\ndegrees of freedom. Equivalently, the remaining freedoms correspond to:\n- Two in-plane translations of the edge (free sliding in the $x$-$y$ plane).\n- One in-plane rotation changing the edge’s direction within the plane (pivoting the edge within the plane).\n- One rotation about the edge itself (rolling the cube about the contact edge).\n\nThus, the minimum number of independent parameters needed to uniquely specify the cube’s position and orientation subject to the “edge-in-contact” constraint is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2193459"}, {"introduction": "Once a convenient set of generalized coordinates has been chosen, the next step is often to express the system's motion in a standard reference frame.

We will determine $T$ and $V$ for the system composed of the box and the cylinder. The problem specifies the generalized coordinates as the absolute positions $X$ (for the box) and $x$ (for the cylinder).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total kinetic energy $T$. This is the sum of the kinetic energy of the box, $T_{box}$, and the kinetic energy of the cylinder, $T_{cyl}$.\n$T = T_{box} + T_{cyl}$\n\nThe box undergoes purely translational motion. Its velocity is the time derivative of its position, $\\dot{X}$. Thus, its kinetic energy is:\n$$T_{box} = \\frac{1}{2}M\\dot{X}^2$$\n\nThe cylinder's motion is more complex, involving both translation and rotation. Its total kinetic energy is the sum of its translational kinetic energy, $T_{cyl, trans}$, and its rotational kinetic energy, $T_{cyl, rot}$.\n$T_{cyl} = T_{cyl, trans} + T_{cyl, rot}$\n\nThe translational kinetic energy of the cylinder is determined by the velocity of its center of mass, which is $\\dot{x}$.\n$$T_{cyl, trans} = \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2$$\n\nThe rotational kinetic energy of the cylinder is given by $T_{cyl, rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia about its center of mass and $\\omega$ is its angular velocity. We are given $I = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2$. We need to find an expression for $\\omega$ in terms of the generalized velocities.\n\nThe relationship for $\\omega$ comes from the constraint that the cylinder rolls without slipping on the floor of the box. This condition means that the velocity of the point of the cylinder in contact with the box floor is equal to the velocity of the box floor itself.\nThe velocity of the cylinder's center of mass relative to the laboratory frame is $\\dot{x}$.\nThe velocity of the box floor relative to the laboratory frame is $\\dot{X}$.\nThe velocity of the cylinder's center of mass relative to the box floor is $v_{rel} = \\dot{x} - \\dot{X}$.\nThe no-slip condition relates this relative translational velocity to the angular velocity: $v_{rel} = R\\omega$.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$\\dot{x} - \\dot{X} = R\\omega$$\nSolving for $\\omega$, we get:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{\\dot{x} - \\dot{X}}{R}$$\n\nNow we can substitute this into the expression for the rotational kinetic energy:\n$$T_{cyl, rot} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\dot{x} - \\dot{X}}{R}\\right)^2$$\n$$T_{cyl, rot} = \\frac{1}{4}mR^2 \\frac{(\\dot{x} - \\dot{X})^2}{R^2} = \\frac{1}{4}m(\\dot{x} - \\dot{X})^2$$\n\nNow, we can assemble the total kinetic energy $T$:\n$$T = T_{box} + T_{cyl, trans} + T_{cyl, rot}$$\n$$T = \\frac{1}{2}M\\dot{X}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2 + \\frac{1}{4}m(\\dot{x} - \\dot{X})^2$$\n\nNext, we consider the potential energy $V$. The box slides on a horizontal surface, and the cylinder rolls on a horizontal surface inside the box. There is no change in the gravitational potential energy of any component. We can therefore set the potential energy to a constant value, which we choose to be zero for simplicity.\n$$V = 0$$\n\nFinally, we construct the Lagrangian $L = T - V$.\n$$L = \\frac{1}{2}M\\dot{X}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2 + \\frac{1}{4}m(\\dot{x} - \\dot{X})^2 - 0$$\nTo simplify, we expand the squared term:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{2}M\\dot{X}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2 + \\frac{1}{4}m(\\dot{x}^2 - 2\\dot{x}\\dot{X} + \\dot{X}^2)$$\nNow, group terms by the velocities:\n$$L = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}M + \\frac{1}{4}m\\right)\\dot{X}^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}m + \\frac{1}{4}m\\right)\\dot{x}^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}\\dot{X}$$\nCombine the coefficients:\n$$L = \\left(\\frac{2M + m}{4}\\right)\\dot{X}^2 + \\frac{3}{4}m\\dot{x}^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}\\dot{X}$$\nThis is the final expression for the Lagrangian of the system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2M+m}{4}\\dot{X}^2 + \\frac{3}{4}m\\dot{x}^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}\\dot{X}}$$", "id": "2193451"}]}
