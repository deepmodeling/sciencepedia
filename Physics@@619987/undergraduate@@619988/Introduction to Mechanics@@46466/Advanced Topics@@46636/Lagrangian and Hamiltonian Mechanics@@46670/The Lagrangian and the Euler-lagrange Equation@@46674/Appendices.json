Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $g$.", "solution": "To solve this problem using the Lagrangian formalism, we first need to identify a suitable generalized coordinate to describe the state of the system. The system has only one degree of freedom because the rotational motion is coupled to the vertical translational motion. Let's choose the vertical displacement of the center of mass of the cylinder from its initial position as our generalized coordinate, denoted by $y$. We'll define the downward direction as positive, so the initial position corresponds to $y=0$ and the potential energy reference is $V=0$ at $y=0$.\n\nThe Lagrangian, $L$, is defined as the difference between the kinetic energy, $T$, and the potential energy, $V$, of the system: $L = T - V$.\n\nFirst, let's find the potential energy $V$. As the cylinder's center of mass moves down by a distance $y$, its potential energy decreases. Relative to the starting point, the potential energy is:\n$$V = -Mgy$$\n\nNext, we find the kinetic energy $T$. The total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational kinetic energy of the center of mass, $T_{trans}$, and the rotational kinetic energy about the center of mass, $T_{rot}$.\n$$T = T_{trans} + T_{rot}$$\nThe translational kinetic energy is given by:\n$$T_{trans} = \\frac{1}{2} M v^2$$\nwhere $v$ is the velocity of the center of mass. In terms of our generalized coordinate $y$, the velocity is $v = \\dot{y}$. Thus:\n$$T_{trans} = \\frac{1}{2} M \\dot{y}^2$$\nThe rotational kinetic energy is given by:\n$$T_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2$$\nwhere $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity. We are given $I = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2$.\n\nWe need to relate the angular velocity $\\omega$ to the linear velocity $\\dot{y}$. The condition that the string unwinds without slipping means that for every infinitesimal downward displacement $dy$ of the center of mass, the cylinder rotates by an angle $d\\theta$ such that $dy = R \\, d\\theta$. Taking the time derivative of this relationship gives the constraint between the linear and angular velocities:\n$$\\dot{y} = R \\dot{\\theta} = R \\omega$$\nFrom this, we can express the angular velocity as $\\omega = \\frac{\\dot{y}}{R}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute this into the expression for rotational kinetic energy:\n$$T_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} MR^2\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\dot{y}}{R}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} MR^2\\right) \\frac{\\dot{y}^2}{R^2} = \\frac{1}{4} M \\dot{y}^2$$\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational and rotational parts:\n$$T = T_{trans} + T_{rot} = \\frac{1}{2} M \\dot{y}^2 + \\frac{1}{4} M \\dot{y}^2 = \\frac{3}{4} M \\dot{y}^2$$\n\nNow we can construct the Lagrangian $L = T - V$:\n$$L = \\frac{3}{4} M \\dot{y}^2 - (-Mgy) = \\frac{3}{4} M \\dot{y}^2 + Mgy$$\n\nThe equation of motion is found using the Euler-Lagrange equation for the coordinate $y$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = 0$$\nLet's compute the required partial derivatives of the Lagrangian:\n$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{y}} \\left(\\frac{3}{4} M \\dot{y}^2 + Mgy\\right) = \\frac{3}{4} M (2\\dot{y}) = \\frac{3}{2} M \\dot{y}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(\\frac{3}{4} M \\dot{y}^2 + Mgy\\right) = Mg$$\n\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{3}{2} M \\dot{y}\\right) - Mg = 0$$\nSince $M$ is a constant, we perform the time differentiation:\n$$\\frac{3}{2} M \\ddot{y} - Mg = 0$$\nThe quantity we are looking for is the downward vertical acceleration, which is $a_y = \\ddot{y}$. Solving for $\\ddot{y}$:\n$$\\frac{3}{2} M \\ddot{y} = Mg$$\n$$\\ddot{y} = \\frac{Mg}{\\frac{3}{2}M} = \\frac{2}{3} g$$\nSo, the downward vertical acceleration of the center of mass of the cylinder is $\\frac{2}{3}g$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}g}$$", "id": "2221465"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, we now explore how the Lagrangian framework is used to analyze the stability of a system and the nature of motion near an equilibrium point.
