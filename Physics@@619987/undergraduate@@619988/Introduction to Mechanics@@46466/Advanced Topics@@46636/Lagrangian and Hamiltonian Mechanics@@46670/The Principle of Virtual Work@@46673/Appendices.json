We analyze a simple structure composed of two rods and a spring, which has a single degree of freedom that can be described by an angle $\\theta$. By expressing the total potential energy of the system—the sum of gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy from the spring—as a function of $\\theta$, we can find the equilibrium state by simply finding where this function is at a minimum.

The rods are joined by a frictionless hinge at one of their ends. The other ends of the rods are free to slide without friction on a horizontal plane. A light vertical spring with spring constant $k$ and natural length $l_0$ connects the hinge to the point on the horizontal plane located symmetrically between the two sliding ends. Let $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity. The system is allowed to settle into a stable equilibrium configuration where the rods are not vertical. Determine the expression for the cosine of the angle, $\\theta$, that each rod makes with the vertical in this equilibrium state. Your answer should be in terms of $M, g, L, k,$ and $l_0$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will use the principle of virtual work, which states that a system is in equilibrium when its total potential energy is at an extremum. We can find the equilibrium angle $\\theta$ by expressing the total potential energy $U$ of the system as a function of $\\theta$ and then finding the value of $\\theta$ for which the derivative of the potential energy with respect to $\\theta$ is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = 0$.\n\nLet's establish a coordinate system. Let the origin $(0,0)$ be on the horizontal plane at the point where the bottom of the vertical spring is attached. The vertical direction is along the y-axis. The angle $\\theta$ is defined as the angle each rod makes with the vertical (the y-axis).\n\nThe total potential energy $U$ of the system is the sum of the gravitational potential energy of the two rods, $U_g$, and the potential energy stored in the spring, $U_s$.\n$$U(\\theta) = U_g(\\theta) + U_s(\\theta)$$\n\nFirst, let's find the gravitational potential energy, $U_g$. The center of mass of a uniform rod of length $L$ is at its midpoint. The height of the hinge above the horizontal plane is $y_{hinge} = L \\cos\\theta$. The center of mass of each rod is at half this height relative to the hinge, along the rod. Thus, the height of the center of mass of each rod above the plane is $y_{cm} = \\frac{1}{2} L \\cos\\theta$. Since there are two identical rods, each of mass $M$, the total gravitational potential energy is:\n$$U_g(\\theta) = 2 \\times (M g y_{cm}) = 2 M g \\left(\\frac{1}{2} L \\cos\\theta\\right) = M g L \\cos\\theta$$\n\nNext, we find the spring potential energy, $U_s$. The spring connects the hinge to the origin. The length of the spring is therefore equal to the height of the hinge, which is $l_{spring} = y_{hinge} = L \\cos\\theta$. The potential energy stored in a spring is given by $U_s = \\frac{1}{2} k (\\text{current length} - \\text{natural length})^2$. The natural length is given as $l_0$. So, the spring potential energy is:\n$$U_s(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k (L \\cos\\theta - l_0)^2$$\n\nNow, we can write the total potential energy of the system as a function of $\\theta$:\n$$U(\\theta) = M g L \\cos\\theta + \\frac{1}{2} k (L \\cos\\theta - l_0)^2$$\n\nFor the system to be in equilibrium, the derivative of the total potential energy with respect to the generalized coordinate $\\theta$ must be zero:\n$$\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = 0$$\nLet's compute this derivative using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = \\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left[ M g L \\cos\\theta + \\frac{1}{2} k (L \\cos\\theta - l_0)^2 \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = M g L (-\\sin\\theta) + \\frac{1}{2} k \\cdot 2 (L \\cos\\theta - l_0) \\cdot \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(L \\cos\\theta - l_0)$$\n$$\\frac{dU}{d\\theta} = -M g L \\sin\\theta + k (L \\cos\\theta - l_0) (-L \\sin\\theta)$$\n\nSetting the derivative to zero for equilibrium:\n$$-M g L \\sin\\theta - k L \\sin\\theta (L \\cos\\theta - l_0) = 0$$\nWe can factor out $-L \\sin\\theta$:\n$$-L \\sin\\theta [M g + k(L \\cos\\theta - l_0)] = 0$$\nThis equation gives two possible conditions for equilibrium:\n1.  $\\sin\\theta = 0$, which implies $\\theta = 0$. This corresponds to the vertical configuration where the two rods are standing straight up.\n2.  $M g + k(L \\cos\\theta - l_0) = 0$. This corresponds to a non-vertical equilibrium.\n\nThe problem asks for the stable, non-vertical equilibrium configuration. We therefore proceed with the second condition:\n$$M g + k(L \\cos\\theta - l_0) = 0$$\nNow, we solve for $\\cos\\theta$:\n$$k(L \\cos\\theta - l_0) = -M g$$\n$$L \\cos\\theta - l_0 = -\\frac{M g}{k}$$\n$$L \\cos\\theta = l_0 - \\frac{M g}{k}$$\n$$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{l_0}{L} - \\frac{M g}{k L}$$\nCombining the terms on the right-hand side into a single fraction gives the final expression:\n$$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{k l_0 - M g}{k L}$$\nThis expression is valid for a physically realizable non-vertical equilibrium, which requires $0 \\leq \\cos\\theta < 1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k l_{0} - M g}{k L}}$$", "id": "2223278"}, {"introduction": "This problem demonstrates the true power of the potential energy method when dealing with more complex geometric constraints. While one could solve for the equilibrium of the rod by carefully balancing all forces and torques, this approach can be complicated as the points of contact and the directions of the normal forces change with the rod's orientation. By using the principle of virtual work, we can bypass these complexities; the only force that does work is gravity, and the normal forces do no work as they are always perpendicular to the virtual displacement. Your task is to define the gravitational potential energy of the rod solely in terms of its angle $\\theta$ and find the angle that minimizes this energy, elegantly leading to the stable equilibrium position [@problem_id:2223242].", "problem": "A uniform rod of length $L=3R$ and mass $m$ is placed inside a fixed, hollow hemisphere of radius $R$.

The stable equilibrium position corresponds to the minimum of the potential energy.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system where the origin is at the center of the hemisphere, and the rim lies in the horizontal plane $z=0$. The bowl's surface is described by $x^2 + z^2 = R^2$ for $z \\le 0$. The rod lies in a vertical plane, say the x-z plane. One end of the rod, $P_1$, rests on the spherical surface, while the rod rests on the rim at point $P_2 = (R, 0)$. The rod makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal.\n\nThe potential energy of the rod is $U = mg z_G$, where $z_G$ is the vertical coordinate of the rod's center of mass. To find the equilibrium, we need to express $z_G$ in terms of $\\theta$.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of the contact point $P_1$. The line representing the rod passes through $P_2=(R,0)$ and makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal. Its equation is $z = \\tan(\\pi - \\theta)(x-R) = -\\tan(\\theta)(x-R)$. Point $P_1(x_1, z_1)$ is the intersection of this line and the circle $x^2+z^2=R^2$. A simpler geometric approach is to note that the length of the chord segment from a point on a circle (the rim) through the interior to the circle's boundary is $s = 2R \\cos\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the angle between the chord and the diameter through the point. Here, the angle is $\\theta$, so the length of the rod inside the hemisphere is $s = 2R\\cos\\theta$.\n\nThe rod has a total length of $L=3R$. Let's denote its ends by $A$ and $B$. Let end $B$ be the one resting on the spherical surface, so $B = P_1$. The rod rests on the rim at $P_2$. The length of the segment $P_2B$ is $s = 2R\\cos\\theta$.

The vector from $B$ towards the other end of the rod (pointing \"up\" and \"out\") is along the direction $(\\cos\\theta, \\sin\\theta)$.
