This first practice delves into the concept of integrability, which is the formal test that separates holonomic from non-holonomic constraints. By working through this problem, you will learn how to use a condition based on partial derivatives to determine when a differential relationship can be integrated into a purely geometric constraint relating the system's coordinates [@problem_id:1241333].", "problem": "In classical mechanics, a constraint on the motion of a particle in a 3D configuration space with coordinates $(x, y, z)$ can sometimes be expressed in a Pfaffian differential form, $P(x,y,z) dx + Q(x,y,z) dy + R(x,y,z) dz = 0$. Such a constraint is called *holonomic* if this differential expression is integrable. This means there exists a function $F(x, y, z)$ such that the constraint can be written as a relation between the coordinates, $F(x, y, z) = \\text{constant}$. For a constraint of the form $dz = A(x,y) dx + B(x,y) dy$, this is equivalent to the differential $A(x,y) dx + B(x,y) dy$ being an exact differential of a function $z(x,y)$.\n\nConsider a particle whose motion is restricted by the Pfaffian differential constraint\n$$dz = \\frac{y}{x} dx + f(x,y) dy$$\nwhere the particle is confined to the region $x > 0$. This constraint is known to be holonomic. Furthermore, the surface $z=z(x,y)$ that describes the constraint satisfies the condition that at $x=1$, its height is given by $z(1,y) = C \\sin(y)$, where $C$ is a given constant.\n\nDetermine the function $f(x,y)$ that satisfies these conditions.", "solution": "The given constraint is defined by the Pfaffian differential form:\n$$dz = \\frac{y}{x} dx + f(x,y) dy$$\nThis can be written as $A(x,y) dx + B(x,y) dy - dz = 0$, where $A(x,y) = \\frac{y}{x}$ and $B(x,y) = f(x,y)$.\n\nA constraint of the form $dz = A(x,y) dx + B(x,y) dy$ is holonomic if the differential on the right-hand side is an exact differential. The condition for an expression $A(x,y) dx + B(x,y) dy$ to be an exact differential is the equality of its mixed partial derivatives, often called the integrability condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x}\n$$\nFirst, we identify the functions $A(x,y)$ and $B(x,y)$:\n$$\nA(x,y) = \\frac{y}{x}\n$$\n$$\nB(x,y) = f(x,y)\n$$\nNext, we compute the partial derivative of $A$ with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nThe partial derivative of $B$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} f(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\n$$\nApplying the integrability condition, we get a partial differential equation for $f(x,y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nTo find $f(x,y)$, we integrate this equation with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a constant. The \"constant\" of integration can be an arbitrary function of $y$, which we will call $g(y)$.\n$$\nf(x,y) = \\int \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\ln(x) + g(y)\n$$\nSince the problem states $x > 0$, we use $\\ln(x)$ instead of $\\ln|x|$.\n\nNow, we must use the boundary condition on the constraint surface $z=z(x,y)$ to determine the function $g(y)$. The constraint equation is now:\n$$\ndz = \\frac{y}{x} dx + (\\ln(x) + g(y)) dy\n$$\nSince this is an exact differential, there exists a function $z(x,y)$ such that:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = \\frac{y}{x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = \\ln(x) + g(y)\n$$\nWe can find $z(x,y)$ by integrating the first equation with respect to $x$:\n$$\nz(x,y) = \\int \\frac{y}{x} dx = y \\ln(x) + h(y)\n$$\nHere, $h(y)$ is another arbitrary function of $y$ that acts as the constant of integration. To relate $h(y)$ to $g(y)$, we differentiate our expression for $z(x,y)$ with respect to $y$ and compare it with the second equation for $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (y \\ln(x) + h(y)) = \\ln(x) + h'(y)\n$$\nComparing this to $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = \\ln(x) + g(y)$, we find the relationship:\n$$\ng(y) = h'(y)\n$$\nNow we apply the given condition: $z(1,y) = C \\sin(y)$.

It provides an excellent illustration of a piecewise holonomic system, where the rules of constraint change abruptly, a common feature in many engineering and real-world scenarios.", "problem": "A simple pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m$ attached to one end of a massless, inextensible string of length $L$. The other end of the string is fixed to a frictionless pivot point $O$. A small, fixed, horizontal peg $P$ is placed directly below the pivot at a distance $d$ from $O$, where $d  L$.

First, we'll determine the speed of the pendulum bob at its lowest point using the principle of conservation of energy. Then, we will calculate the tension in the string just before and just after it interacts with the peg by applying Newton's second law for circular motion. Finally, we will compute the required ratio.\n\n**Step 1: Find the bob's speed at the lowest point**\n\nLet the potential energy of the bob be zero at the lowest point of its swing (a vertical distance $L$ below the pivot $O$). When the pendulum is released from rest at an angle $\\theta_0$, the bob is at a vertical height $h$ above this zero-potential level. This height can be found using trigonometry: $h = L - L\\cos\\theta_0 = L(1-\\cos\\theta_0)$.\n\nThe initial mechanical energy $E_i$ of the system is purely potential energy since it's released from rest:\n$$E_i = U_i + K_i = mgh + 0 = mgL(1-\\cos\\theta_0)$$\nAs the bob swings down to its lowest point, its height becomes zero ($h=0$), and its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Let the speed of the bob at the lowest point be $v_{bot}$. The mechanical energy $E_f$ at this point is purely kinetic:\n$$E_f = U_f + K_f = 0 + \\frac{1}{2}mv_{bot}^2$$\nBy the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, $E_i = E_f$:\n$$mgL(1-\\cos\\theta_0) = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{bot}^2$$\nSolving for $v_{bot}^2$, we get:\n$$v_{bot}^2 = 2gL(1-\\cos\\theta_0)$$\nThe speed of the bob is continuous at the lowest point, so this value is valid for the instant just before and just after the string hits the peg.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the tension $T_{before}$**\n\nAn infinitesimal moment before the bob reaches the lowest point, it is moving along a circular path of radius $R_1 = L$, centered at the pivot $O$. At the lowest point, the tension $T_{before}$ acts upward, and the gravitational force $mg$ acts downward. The net force provides the centripetal force required for circular motion.\nApplying Newton's second law in the radial direction:\n$$\\sum F_r = m a_c$$\n$$T_{before} - mg = m \\frac{v_{bot}^2}{R_1} = m \\frac{v_{bot}^2}{L}$$\nSolving for $T_{before}$:\n$$T_{before} = mg + \\frac{m v_{bot}^2}{L}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{bot}^2$ from Step 1:\n$$T_{before} = mg + \\frac{m}{L} \\left( 2gL(1-\\cos\\theta_0) \\right) = mg + 2mg(1-\\cos\\theta_0)$$\n$$T_{before} = mg(1 + 2 - 2\\cos\\theta_0) = mg(3-2\\cos\\theta_0)$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the tension $T_{after}$**\n\nAn infinitesimal moment after the bob passes the lowest point, the string is wrapping around the peg $P$. The effective pivot point has changed to $P$, and the new radius of the circular path is $R_2 = L-d$. The speed of the bob is still $v_{bot}$.\nThe forces are the same (tension $T_{after}$ upward, gravity $mg$ downward), but the centripetal acceleration is now determined by the new radius $R_2$.\nApplying Newton's second law again:\n$$T_{after} - mg = m \\frac{v_{bot}^2}{R_2} = m \\frac{v_{bot}^2}{L-d}$$\nSolving for $T_{after}$:\n$$T_{after} = mg + \\frac{m v_{bot}^2}{L-d}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{bot}^2$:\n$$T_{after} = mg + \\frac{m}{L-d} \\left( 2gL(1-\\cos\\theta_0) \\right) = mg \\left( 1 + \\frac{2L(1-\\cos\\theta_0)}{L-d} \\right)$$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the ratio $\\frac{T_{after}}{T_{before}}$**\n\nNow we can compute the ratio of the two tensions:\n$$\\frac{T_{after}}{T_{before}} = \\frac{mg \\left( 1 + \\frac{2L(1-\\cos\\theta_0)}{L-d} \\right)}{mg(3-2\\cos\\theta_0)}$$\nThe $mg$ terms cancel out:\n$$\\frac{T_{after}}{T_{before}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{2L(1-\\cos\\theta_0)}{L-d}}{3-2\\cos\\theta_0}$$\nTo simplify this into a single fraction, we find a common denominator for the numerator:\n$$1 + \\frac{2L(1-\\cos\\theta_0)}{L-d} = \\frac{L-d}{L-d} + \\frac{2L - 2L\\cos\\theta_0}{L-d} = \\frac{L-d+2L-2L\\cos\\theta_0}{L-d} = \\frac{3L-d-2L\\cos\\theta_0}{L-d}$$\nSubstituting this back into the ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{T_{after}}{T_{before}} = \\frac{\\frac{3L-d-2L\\cos\\theta_0}{L-d}}{3-2\\cos\\theta_0} = \\frac{3L-d-2L\\cos\\theta_0}{(L-d)(3-2\\cos\\theta_0)}$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3L-d-2L\\cos\\theta_0}{(L-d)(3-2\\cos\\theta_0)}}$$", "id": "2195743"}, {"introduction": "To complete our exploration, we now turn to the fascinating realm of non-holonomic constraints, where the restrictions are on the system's velocities rather than its coordinates.
