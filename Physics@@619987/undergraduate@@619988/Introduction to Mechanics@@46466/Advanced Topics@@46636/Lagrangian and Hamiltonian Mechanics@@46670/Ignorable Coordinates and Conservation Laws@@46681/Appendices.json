The question is unambiguous and has a unique, definite answer derivable from the given information.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical and physical language.

There are no internal contradictions.\n5.  **Other checks**: The problem is not trivial, unrealistic, ill-posed, or unverifiable. It is a standard, formalizable problem in theoretical physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation\nThe solution requires the application of fundamental definitions from Lagrangian mechanics.\n\n1.  **Mechanical Momentum ($\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{mech}}$)**: The mechanical momentum is the momentum associated with the actual motion of mass. For a particle of mass $m$ moving with velocity $\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}$, it is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{mech}} = m\\,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\n    $$\n    This is the quantity that would be measured by observing the particle's mass and velocity. In component form, $\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{mech}} = (m\\dot{x}, m\\dot{y}, m\\dot{z})$.\n\n2.  **Canonical Momentum ($\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{can}}$)**: In Lagrangian mechanics, the canonical momentum conjugate to a generalized coordinate $q_i$ is defined as $p_i = \\partial L / \\partial \\dot{q}_i$. In this problem, the generalized coordinates are the components of the position vector $\\mathbf{r}=(x, y, z)$. The canonical momentum is a vector $\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{can}}$ with components:\n    $$\n    p_{\\mathrm{can},i} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{r}_i} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}\n    $$\n    The given Lagrangian is $L=\\tfrac{1}{2}m(\\dot{x}^2+\\dot{y}^2+\\dot{z}^2) + q(\\dot{x}A_x + \\dot{y}A_y + \\dot{z}A_z) - q\\phi(x,y,z)$.\n    Let us compute the components of $\\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{can}}$:\n    $$\n    p_{\\mathrm{can},x} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\left( \\tfrac{1}{2}m\\dot{x}^2 \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{x}} \\left( q\\dot{x}A_x \\right) = m\\dot{x} + qA_x(\\mathbf{r})\n    $$\n    Similarly for the $y$ and $z$ components:\n    $$\n    p_{\\mathrm{can},y} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} = m\\dot{y} + qA_y(\\mathbf{r})\n    $$\n    $$\n    p_{\\mathrm{can},z} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{z}} = m\\dot{z} + qA_z(\\mathbf{r})\n    $$\n    Combining these components into a vector equation gives the canonical momentum:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{p}_{\\mathrm{can}} = m\\,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} + q\\,\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})\n    $$\n    As shown, the canonical momentum differs from the mechanical momentum by the term $q\\,\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\n3.  **Conserved Quantity**: According to Noether's theorem, if a Lagrangian is invariant under a continuous transformation described by a parameter $s$, there is a corresponding conserved quantity. For a spatial translation, $r_k \\to r_k + \\delta r_k$, if the Lagrangian is unchanged (i.e., $\\partial L / \\partial r_k = 0$), then the coordinate $r_k$ is called \"cyclic\" or \"ignorable\". The Euler-Lagrange equation for this coordinate is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{r}_k}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial r_k} = 0\n    $$\n    If $\\partial L / \\partial r_k = 0$, this simplifies to $\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{r}_k}\\right) = 0$. This implies that the quantity $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{r}_k}$ is constant in time, i.e., it is a conserved quantity. The quantity $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{r}_k}$ is precisely the $k$-th component of the canonical momentum, $p_{\\mathrm{can},k}$.\n\n    The problem states that the potentials are independent of the $y$ coordinate: $\\partial \\mathbf{A}/\\partial y=\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\partial \\phi/\\partial y=0$. We must check if this implies $\\partial L / \\partial y = 0$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\tfrac{1}{2}m\\,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}^{2}+q\\,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})-q\\,\\phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\right)\n    $$\n    The term $\\tfrac{1}{2}m\\,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}^{2}$ has no explicit dependence on $y$. The term $q\\,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})$ depends on $y$ only through $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})$. Its derivative with respect to $y$ is $q\\,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot(\\partial \\mathbf{A}/\\partial y)$. The term $-q\\,\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ depends on $y$ through $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$. Its derivative is $-q(\\partial\\phi/\\partial y)$.\n    So,\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial y} = q\\,\\dot{\\mathbf{r}}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{A}}{\\partial y} - q \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\n    $$\n    Given that $\\partial \\mathbf{A}/\\partial y=\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\partial \\phi/\\partial y=0$, we have $\\partial L / \\partial y = 0$. Thus, the coordinate $y$ is cyclic.\n    The conserved quantity is the canonical momentum conjugate to $y$, which is $p_{\\mathrm{can},y}$. From our earlier calculation:\n    $$\n    p_{\\mathrm{can},y} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{y}} = m\\,\\dot{y} + q\\,A_y(\\mathbf{r})\n    $$\n    This quantity is a constant of motion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA.
