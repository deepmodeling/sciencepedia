In this practice, we will explore how Newton's laws are modified by introducing a fictitious force that accounts for the frame's acceleration. By analyzing the motion of an object dropped inside an accelerating vehicle, you will learn to apply a modified version of Newton's second law and calculate an object's trajectory from the perspective of a non-inertial observer [@problem_id:2067806].", "problem": "Consider a futuristic transport pod designed for rapid transit. The pod moves along a perfectly straight and horizontal track. For a segment of its journey, it maintains a constant horizontal acceleration of magnitude $a$ relative to the ground. Inside the pod, the floor is flat and the ceiling is at a uniform height $h$ above the floor. A small, dense sphere is held at rest relative to the pod, just touching the ceiling. At a certain moment, the sphere is released. An observer inside the pod wants to predict where the sphere will land on the floor.\n\nAssuming the acceleration due to gravity is a constant $g$, and neglecting air resistance inside the pod, determine the horizontal distance between the point where the sphere lands on the floor and the point on the floor that was directly beneath the sphere at the instant of its release.\n\nExpress your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $a$, $h$, and $g$.", "solution": "This problem can be most efficiently solved by analyzing the motion of the sphere from the perspective of an observer inside the accelerating transport pod. This is a non-inertial reference frame because the pod is accelerating relative to the ground (an inertial frame).\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system fixed to the pod. Let the origin be the point on the floor directly below the sphere's release point. Let the positive $y$-axis point vertically upwards, and the positive $x$-axis point horizontally in the direction of the pod's acceleration, $a$. Then the initial position of the sphere is $(x_0, y_0) = (0, h)$.\n\nIn a non-inertial frame accelerating with $\\vec{a}_{frame}$, an object of mass $m$ experiences a fictitious force, $\\vec{F}_{fict} = -m\\vec{a}_{frame}$. In this problem, the pod's acceleration is $\\vec{a}_{frame} = a \\hat{x}$. Therefore, the fictitious force on the sphere is $\\vec{F}_{fict} = -ma \\hat{x}$. This force acts horizontally, in the direction opposite to the pod's acceleration.\n\nThe real gravitational force acting on the sphere is $\\vec{F}_{g} = -mg \\hat{y}$, acting vertically downwards.\n\nThe net force on the sphere as observed within the pod's frame is the vector sum of the real and fictitious forces:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{net} = \\vec{F}_{g} + \\vec{F}_{fict} = -ma \\hat{x} - mg \\hat{y}\n$$\nAccording to Newton's second law in the non-inertial frame, $\\vec{F}_{net} = m\\vec{a}_{rel}$, where $\\vec{a}_{rel}$ is the acceleration of the sphere relative to the pod.\n$$\nm\\vec{a}_{rel} = -ma \\hat{x} - mg \\hat{y}\n$$\nDividing by the mass $m$, we find the components of the sphere's acceleration in the pod's frame:\n$$\na_{rel, x} = -a\n$$\n$$\na_{rel, y} = -g\n$$\nThe sphere is released from rest *relative to the pod*, so its initial velocity components in this frame are $v_{0x} = 0$ and $v_{0y} = 0$.\n\nThe motion in the $y$-direction is independent of the motion in the $x$-direction. We can find the time of flight, $t_{fall}$, by analyzing the vertical motion. The sphere falls a distance $h$.\nUsing the kinematic equation for vertical displacement:\n$$\n\\Delta y = y_{final} - y_{initial} = v_{0y} t_{fall} + \\frac{1}{2} a_{rel, y} t_{fall}^2\n$$\n$$\n0 - h = (0)t_{fall} + \\frac{1}{2}(-g)t_{fall}^2\n$$\n$$\n-h = -\\frac{1}{2} g t_{fall}^2\n$$\nSolving for $t_{fall}$:\n$$\nt_{fall} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}\n$$\nNow, we can find the horizontal distance traveled during this time. Let this distance be $d$. We use the kinematic equation for horizontal displacement:\n$$\n\\Delta x = d = v_{0x} t_{fall} + \\frac{1}{2} a_{rel, x} t_{fall}^2\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nd = (0)t_{fall} + \\frac{1}{2}(-a) t_{fall}^2\n$$\n$$\nd = -\\frac{1}{2} a t_{fall}^2\n$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $t_{fall}^2$:\n$$\nd = -\\frac{1}{2} a \\left( \\frac{2h}{g} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nd = -\\frac{ah}{g}\n$$\nThe question asks for the horizontal distance, which is a magnitude. The negative sign indicates that the displacement is in the negative $x$-direction (i.e., opposite to the pod's acceleration), which is physically expected. The distance is the absolute value of this displacement.\n$$\n\\text{Distance} = |d| = \\frac{ah}{g}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{ah}{g}}$$", "id": "2067806"}, {"introduction": "Moving from linear to rotational motion introduces new dynamics, namely the centrifugal and Coriolis forces. This exercise presents a classic scenario to isolate and understand these fictitious forces without the complication of other real forces.

At $t=0$ the two frames are aligned and share the same origin at the platform center.\n\nPhysical principle in the inertial frame: The puck experiences no horizontal real force because the surface is frictionless and flat, so by Newton's first law its velocity is constant in the inertial frame. Since the puck starts at the origin and is given initial velocity of magnitude $v_{0}$ along the $+x$ direction of the rotating frame, and the frames are aligned at $t=0$, this equals the $+X$ direction of the inertial frame at $t=0$.
