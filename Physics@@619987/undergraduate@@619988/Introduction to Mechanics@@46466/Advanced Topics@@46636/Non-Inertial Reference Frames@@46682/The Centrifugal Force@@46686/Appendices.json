By analyzing the situation from the perspective of the object's co-rotating frame of reference, we can use the concept of centrifugal force to determine the minimum angular velocity, $\\omega_{\\min}$, required to defy gravity at the top of the path [@problem_id:2038420]. This exercise provides a foundational understanding of how an apparent outward force emerges in a rotating frame and how it can be used to counteract real forces like gravity, a principle seen in applications from amusement park rides to centrifuges.", "problem": "A specialized manufacturing process uses a centrifuge to form small components. A small bead of material, with mass $m$, is placed inside a mold. The mold is fixed to the end of a rigid, massless arm of length $R$. This arm rotates in a vertical plane about a fixed pivot at a constant angular velocity $\\omega$. For the process to succeed, the bead must remain pressed against the inner surface of the mold (the surface furthest from the pivot) at all times.\n\nYour task is to analyze the system from the perspective of a reference frame that co-rotates with the arm. Using this non-inertial frame, determine the minimum angular velocity, $\\omega_{min}$, required to ensure the bead does not lose contact with the mold, even at the highest point of its circular path. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "Consider the frame that co-rotates with the arm at constant angular speed $\\omega$. In this non-inertial frame, the bead is at rest relative to the mold, so its acceleration relative to the frame is zero. The forces acting on the bead in this frame are:\n- Real forces: gravity $\\vec{W} = m\\vec{g}$ (downward) and the mold’s normal force $\\vec{N}$ (directed radially inward, toward the pivot).\n- Fictitious forces due to rotation: the centrifugal force $\\vec{F}_{\\text{cf}} = m\\omega^{2}R\\,\\hat{r}$ (radially outward). The Coriolis force is zero because the bead has no velocity relative to the rotating frame, and the Euler force is zero because $\\omega$ is constant.\n\nSince the bead is at rest in the rotating frame, the force balance is\n$$\n\\vec{N} + m\\vec{g} + m\\omega^{2}R\\,\\hat{r} = \\vec{0}.\n$$\n\nChoose the radial outward direction (along the arm away from the pivot) as positive. At the highest point of the motion, the radial outward direction is upward, so gravity contributes $-mg$ along the radial direction. The normal force is inward, contributing $-N$ along the radial direction. The centrifugal force contributes $+m\\omega^{2}R$. The scalar radial balance is therefore\n$$\nm\\omega^{2}R - mg - N = 0 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad N = m\\omega^{2}R - mg.\n$$\n\nFor the bead to remain in contact with the mold, the normal force must satisfy $N \\geq 0$.

This problem models engineering challenges where components must remain stable on a rotating surface across a range of speeds [@problem_id:2217836]. You will discover how static friction, $f_s$, adaptively opposes the net tendency of motion, acting either inward or outward to balance the constant spring force against the speed-dependent centrifugal force, thus defining a stable range of angular velocities.", "problem": "A small block of mass $m$ is placed on a flat, horizontal turntable that can rotate about a vertical axis passing through its center. The block is connected to the center of the turntable by an ideal linear spring with spring constant $k$ and a natural, unstretched length of $L_0$. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the turntable is $\\mu_s$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nThe block is positioned at a fixed radial distance $R$ from the center, such that $R > L_0$. The setup is such that if the turntable were at rest ($\\omega = 0$), the inward force from the stretched spring would be great enough to overcome the maximum static friction force.\n\nAs the turntable's angular velocity $\\omega$ is varied, there exists a continuous range of values, from a minimum $\\omega_{min}$ to a maximum $\\omega_{max}$, for which the block will remain stationary at the radius $R$ without slipping.\n\nDetermine the value of the quantity $\\omega_{max}^2 - \\omega_{min}^2$.

It is convenient to work in the non-inertial rotating frame of reference of the turntable. In this frame, the block is in static equilibrium, and we must consider the centrifugal force in addition to the real forces.\n\nLet's define the radially outward direction as positive. The forces acting on the block in the radial direction are:\n1.  The spring force, $F_s$: The spring is stretched by an amount $(R - L_0)$. According to Hooke's Law, the spring exerts an inward force, so its component in our coordinate system is negative.\n    $F_s = -k(R - L_0)$.\n2.  The centrifugal force, $F_{cf}$: This is a fictitious force that acts radially outward in the rotating frame.\n    $F_{cf} = m \\omega^2 R$.\n3.  The static friction force, $f_s$: This force opposes the tendency of motion. Its magnitude can vary from zero up to a maximum value, $f_{s,max}$. The maximum static friction is given by $f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N$, where $N$ is the normal force. Since the turntable is horizontal, the normal force balances the gravitational force, so $N = mg$. Thus, $f_{s,max} = \\mu_s m g$. The direction of $f_s$ can be inward or outward.\n\nFor the block to remain in static equilibrium at radius $R$, the net force in the radial direction must be zero.\n$\\sum F_{radial} = F_{cf} + F_s + f_s = 0$\n$m \\omega^2 R - k(R - L_0) + f_s = 0$\nThe static friction force $f_s$ required to maintain equilibrium is therefore:\n$f_s = k(R - L_0) - m \\omega^2 R$\n\nThe block will remain stationary as long as the magnitude of this required friction force does not exceed the maximum possible static friction: $|f_s| \\le f_{s,max}$.\n\nFirst, let's find the maximum angular velocity, $\\omega_{max}$. This occurs when the block is on the verge of sliding outward. In this case, the outward centrifugal force is at its largest, and the static friction force must act inward to prevent slipping. An inward force is negative in our coordinate system, so friction takes its maximum inward value, $f_s = -f_{s,max} = -\\mu_s m g$.\nSubstituting this into our equilibrium friction equation:\n$-\\mu_s m g = k(R - L_0) - m \\omega_{max}^2 R$\nSolving for $\\omega_{max}^2$:\n$m \\omega_{max}^2 R = k(R - L_0) + \\mu_s m g$\n$\\omega_{max}^2 = \\frac{k(R - L_0) + \\mu_s m g}{m R}$\n\nNext, let's find the minimum angular velocity, $\\omega_{min}$. This occurs when the block is on the verge of sliding inward. This is possible because the problem states that at rest, the spring force is strong enough to overcome static friction. To prevent inward sliding, the centrifugal force must assist an outward-directed static friction force. The static friction force will be directed outward with its maximum magnitude, $f_s = +f_{s,max} = +\\mu_s m g$.\nSubstituting this into our equilibrium friction equation:\n$+\\mu_s m g = k(R - L_0) - m \\omega_{min}^2 R$\nSolving for $\\omega_{min}^2$:\n$m \\omega_{min}^2 R = k(R - L_0) - \\mu_s m g$\n$\\omega_{min}^2 = \\frac{k(R - L_0) - \\mu_s m g}{m R}$\nThe condition given in the problem, $k(R - L_0) > \\mu_s m g$, ensures that $\\omega_{min}^2$ is positive and thus $\\omega_{min}$ is a real, non-zero angular velocity.\n\nFinally, we need to compute the value of $\\omega_{max}^2 - \\omega_{min}^2$.\n$\\omega_{max}^2 - \\omega_{min}^2 = \\left( \\frac{k(R - L_0) + \\mu_s m g}{m R} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{k(R - L_0) - \\mu_s m g}{m R} \\right)$\nCombining the terms over the common denominator $mR$:\n$\\omega_{max}^2 - \\omega_{min}^2 = \\frac{(k(R - L_0) + \\mu_s m g) - (k(R - L_0) - \\mu_s m g)}{m R}$\n$\\omega_{max}^2 - \\omega_{min}^2 = \\frac{k(R - L_0) + \\mu_s m g - k(R - L_0) + \\mu_s m g}{m R}$\nThe terms involving the spring constant $k$ and natural length $L_0$ cancel out:\n$\\omega_{max}^2 - \\omega_{min}^2 = \\frac{2 \\mu_s m g}{m R}$\nThe mass $m$ also cancels out:\n$\\omega_{max}^2 - \\omega_{min}^2 = \\frac{2 \\mu_s g}{R}$\nThis is our final expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2 \\mu_s g}{R}}$$", "id": "2217836"}, {"introduction": "Having explored equilibrium, we now turn to a dynamic situation to see what happens when the centrifugal force is unopposed.
