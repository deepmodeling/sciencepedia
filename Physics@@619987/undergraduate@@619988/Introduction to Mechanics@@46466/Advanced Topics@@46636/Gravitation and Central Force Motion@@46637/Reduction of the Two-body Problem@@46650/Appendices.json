Let Atom 1 and Atom 2 have identical masses, denoted by the symbol $m$. These atoms interact with each other through a potential that depends only on the separation distance $r$ between them. The equilibrium separation distance is a constant $d_0$. To analyze the vibrational motion of the molecule, it is convenient to transform this two-body problem into an equivalent one-body problem. This involves studying the motion of a single fictitious particle with a \"reduced mass\" $\\mu$ that moves under the influence of the same interaction potential.\n\nDetermine the reduced mass $\\mu$ for this model of a diatomic molecule.

We can assign the masses as follows:\nThe mass of Atom 1 is $m_1 = m$.\nThe mass of Atom 2 is $m_2 = m$.\n\nThe problem also mentions an equilibrium separation distance $d_0$. However, the calculation of the reduced mass only depends on the masses of the interacting particles, not on the distance between them. Therefore, $d_0$ is extra information not required for the solution.\n\nNow, we substitute the given masses into the formula for the reduced mass:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{(m)(m)}{m + m}\n$$\n\nNext, we perform the algebraic simplification:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{m^2}{2m}\n$$\n\nBy canceling one factor of $m$ from the numerator and the denominator, we arrive at the final expression for the reduced mass:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{m}{2}\n$$\n\nThe physical significance of this result is that the equivalent one-body problem, which describes the relative motion (like vibration) of the two atoms, behaves as if a single particle of mass $m/2$ is oscillating.
