However, it is essential to remember that the effective potential includes a term for angular momentum, which is not part of the true physical interaction. This exercise challenges you to reverse-engineer the underlying central force law from a given effective potential, reinforcing the critical distinction between the physical force and the mathematical construct used to analyze it.", "problem": "In a theoretical model for the interaction within a certain astrophysical system, physicists explore non-standard force laws. Consider a simplified planar model where a particle of mass $m$ moves under the influence of a central force originating from a fixed point. The particle's angular momentum, $L$, is conserved. The radial component of the particle's motion is governed by a one-dimensional effective potential energy function given by:\n$$U_{\\text{eff}}(r) = \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - \\frac{k}{4r^4}$$\nHere, $r$ is the radial distance of the particle from the force center, and $k$ is a positive constant that characterizes the strength of this theoretical interaction. Based on this effective potential, determine the mathematical expression for the central force law, $F(r)$, which is responsible for this interaction.", "solution": "The central force, $F(r)$, is related to the true potential energy, $U(r)$, of the interaction, not the effective potential energy. The relationship is given by the negative gradient of the potential, which in one dimension (for the radial component) is:\n$$F(r) = - \\frac{dU(r)}{dr}$$\nThe effective potential, $U_{\\text{eff}}(r)$, is defined as the sum of the true potential energy $U(r)$ and the centrifugal potential energy term, which arises from the conservation of angular momentum $L$. The definition is:\n$$U_{\\text{eff}}(r) = U(r) + \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}$$\nWhere $m$ is the mass of the particle. Our first step is to isolate the true potential energy, $U(r)$, from this definition.\n$$U(r) = U_{\\text{eff}}(r) - \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}$$\nThe problem provides the specific form of the effective potential:\n$$U_{\\text{eff}}(r) = \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - \\frac{k}{4r^4}$$\nWe substitute this expression into our equation for $U(r)$:\n$$U(r) = \\left( \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - \\frac{k}{4r^4} \\right) - \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}$$\nThe centrifugal term $\\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}$ cancels out, leaving us with the true potential energy of the central force interaction:\n$$U(r) = - \\frac{k}{4r^4}$$\nNow that we have the true potential $U(r)$, we can find the force $F(r)$ by taking its negative derivative with respect to $r$:\n$$F(r) = - \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( - \\frac{k}{4r^4} \\right)$$\nThe double negative signs cancel, and we can pull the constant factor $\\frac{k}{4}$ out of the derivative:\n$$F(r) = \\frac{k}{4} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{1}{r^4} \\right) = \\frac{k}{4} \\frac{d}{dr} (r^{-4})$$\nUsing the power rule for differentiation, which states that $\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = nx^{n-1}$, we have:\n$$F(r) = \\frac{k}{4} (-4 r^{-4-1})$$\n$$F(r) = \\frac{k}{4} (-4 r^{-5})$$\nThe factor of 4 in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n$$F(r) = -k r^{-5}$$\nExpressing this with a positive exponent in the denominator gives the final form of the force law:\n$$F(r) = - \\frac{k}{r^5}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that this is an attractive force, directed towards the center.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{k}{r^5}}$$", "id": "2181917"}, {"introduction": "Once we understand the effective potential, we can use it to predict the nature of possible orbits without solving the full equations of motion. Stable circular orbits correspond to local minima of the effective potential energy curve, a point where the net radial force is zero and any small perturbation leads to a restoring force.
