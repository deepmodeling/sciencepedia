For a particle of mass $m$ with angular momentum $L$ under a central force with radial component $F(r)$, the effective potential is given by $U_{\\text{eff}}(r) = U(r) + \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2}$, where $F(r) = -\\frac{dU}{dr}$.\n\nA circular orbit at radius $r_0$ is possible if the effective force is zero, which means the derivative of the effective potential is zero:\n$$ \\frac{dU_{\\text{eff}}}{dr} \\bigg|_{r=r_0} = -\\left( F(r) + \\frac{L^2}{mr^3} \\right) \\bigg|_{r=r_0} = 0 $$\nThis gives the condition for a circular orbit: $F(r_0) = -\\frac{L^2}{mr_0^3}$. Since the force is attractive, $F(r_0)  0$, which means a real value for $L$ always exists for any $r_0  0$.\n\nFor the orbit to be stable against small radial perturbations, the circular orbit radius $r_0$ must correspond to a local minimum of the effective potential. This requires the second derivative of the effective potential to be positive:\n$$ \\frac{d^2U_{\\text{eff}}}{dr^2} \\bigg|_{r=r_0}  0 $$\nLet's compute the second derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d^2U_{\\text{eff}}}{dr^2} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( -F(r) - \\frac{L^2}{mr^3} \\right) = -F'(r) + \\frac{3L^2}{mr^4} $$\nAt the radius of the circular orbit $r_0$, we can substitute $L^2 = -mr_0^3 F(r_0)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2U_{\\text{eff}}}{dr^2} \\bigg|_{r=r_0} = -F'(r_0) + \\frac{3(-mr_0^3 F(r_0))}{mr_0^4} = -F'(r_0) - \\frac{3}{r_0}F(r_0) $$\nThe stability condition is therefore:\n$$ -F'(r_0) - \\frac{3}{r_0}F(r_0)  0 \\quad \\implies \\quad F'(r_0) + \\frac{3}{r_0}F(r_0)  0 $$\nWe will now apply this condition to the two regions specified in the problem.
