The gravitational constant is $G$. For a satellite in a stable circular orbit of radius $r$, the gravitational force exerted by the planet provides the necessary centripetal force to maintain the orbit.\n\nThe gravitational force is given by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation:\n$$F_g = \\frac{G M m}{r^2}$$\nThe centripetal force required for circular motion is:\n$$F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r}$$\nwhere $v$ is the orbital speed of the satellite.\n\nEquating these two forces gives us the condition for a stable orbit:\n$$\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}$$\nWe can simplify this by canceling $m$ and one factor of $r$:\n$$v^2 = \\frac{G M}{r}$$\nThe orbital speed $v$ is related to the orbital period $T$ and the radius $r$ by the distance of one revolution divided by the time taken:\n$$v = \\frac{2 \\pi r}{T}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $v$ into our force balance equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{G M}{r}$$\nSquaring the term on the left side gives:\n$$\\frac{4 \\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{r}$$\nTo find the relationship between the period $T$ and the radius $r$, we rearrange the equation to solve for $T^2$:\n$$T^2 = \\left(\\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G M}\\right) r^3$$\nThis relationship is Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits. The term in the parentheses, $\\left(\\frac{4 \\pi^2}{G M}\\right)$, is a constant for any satellite orbiting this particular planet. Therefore, we can write the proportionality $T^2 \\propto r^3$, or $T \\propto r^{3/2}$.\n\nWe can use this proportionality to relate the initial and final states of the satellite. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript 1 and the final state by subscript 2.\n$$\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nWe are given that the initial period is $T_1 = 90.0$ minutes and the radius of the new orbit is four times the initial radius, so $\\frac{r_2}{r_1} = 4$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{T_2}{90.0 \\text{ min}} = (4)^{3/2}$$\nWe can evaluate the right-hand side:\n$$(4)^{3/2} = (\\sqrt{4})^3 = 2^3 = 8$$\nNow we can solve for the new period, $T_2$:\n$$T_2 = 8 \\times T_1 = 8 \\times 90.0 \\text{ min} = 720 \\text{ min}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in hours.
