The Hohmann transfer orbit, conceived by Walter Hohmann in 1925, represents the most fuel-efficient two-burn maneuver to travel between two coplanar circular orbits. This foundational exercise guides you through the step-by-step derivation of the total velocity change, or $\\Delta v$, required for this maneuver, providing a cornerstone for understanding the energetics of spaceflight. [@problem_id:2082592]", "problem": "A satellite of mass $m$ is in a stable circular orbit of radius $R_1$ around a central body of mass $M$. The mission requires moving the satellite to a larger, coplanar circular orbit of radius $R_2$. This orbital transfer is to be accomplished using a two-stage maneuver consisting of instantaneous tangential thrusts.\n\nThe first thrust occurs at a point on the initial orbit, changing the satellite's velocity to place it into an intermediate transfer orbit. This transfer orbit is an ellipse whose closest point to the central body (periapsis) is at radius $R_1$ and whose farthest point (apoapsis) is at radius $R_2$.\n\nWhen the satellite reaches the apoapsis of this transfer orbit, a second instantaneous tangential thrust is applied. This second thrust adjusts the satellite's velocity to place it into the final circular orbit of radius $R_2$.\n\nLet $G$ be the universal gravitational constant. Determine a symbolic expression for the total change in speed, $\\Delta v_{\\text{total}}$, that the satellite must undergo. This total change is defined as the sum of the magnitudes of the two individual speed changes from the thrusts. Express your answer in terms of $G$, $M$, $R_1$, and $R_2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total change in speed, $\\Delta v_{\\text{total}}$, required to move a satellite from an inner circular orbit of radius $R_1$ to an outer circular orbit of radius $R_2$ using a Hohmann transfer orbit. The total change in speed is the sum of the magnitudes of the two required velocity boosts, $\\Delta v_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta v_1 + \\Delta v_2$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the speed of the satellite in the initial and final circular orbits. For a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force:\n$$\n\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r}\n$$\nSolving for the speed $v$, we get $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}$.\n\nFor the initial circular orbit of radius $R_1$, the speed $v_1$ is:\n$$\nv_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_1}}\n$$\nFor the final circular orbit of radius $R_2$, the speed $v_2$ is:\n$$\nv_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_2}}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the elliptical transfer orbit. The periapsis of this orbit is at $r_p = R_1$ and the apoapsis is at $r_a = R_2$. The semi-major axis, $a$, of the transfer ellipse is half the sum of the periapsis and apoapsis distances:\n$$\na = \\frac{r_p + r_a}{2} = \\frac{R_1 + R_2}{2}\n$$\nThe total energy $E$ of a satellite in an elliptical orbit is given by $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2a}$. The total energy is also the sum of its kinetic and potential energy at any point in the orbit: $E = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}$. Equating these two expressions for energy gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r} = -\\frac{GMm}{2a}\n$$\nDividing by $m$ and solving for $v^2$, we obtain the vis-viva equation:\n$$\nv^2 = GM \\left( \\frac{2}{r} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right)\n$$\nWe use this equation to find the speeds of the satellite on the transfer orbit at periapsis and apoapsis.\n\nThe first thrust is applied at the periapsis of the transfer orbit ($r = r_p = R_1$). The speed the satellite must have immediately after this thrust, let's call it $v_p$, is found by substituting $r=R_1$ and $a = \\frac{R_1+R_2}{2}$ into the vis-viva equation:\n$$\nv_p^2 = GM \\left( \\frac{2}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right) = GM \\left( \\frac{2}{R_1} - \\frac{2}{R_1 + R_2} \\right) = GM \\left( \\frac{2(R_1 + R_2) - 2R_1}{R_1(R_1 + R_2)} \\right) = \\frac{2GMR_2}{R_1(R_1 + R_2)}\n$$\nSo, the speed at periapsis is:\n$$\nv_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GMR_2}{R_1(R_1 + R_2)}}\n$$\nThe first change in speed, $\\Delta v_1$, is the difference between this speed and the speed of the initial circular orbit, $v_1$. Since both velocities are in the same direction, the magnitude of the change is:\n$$\n\\Delta v_1 = v_p - v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GMR_2}{R_1(R_1 + R_2)}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_1}}\n$$\n\nThe second thrust is applied at the apoapsis of the transfer orbit ($r = r_a = R_2$). The speed of the satellite just before this thrust, let's call it $v_a$, is found by substituting $r=R_2$ into the vis-viva equation:\n$$\nv_a^2 = GM \\left( \\frac{2}{R_2} - \\frac{1}{a} \\right) = GM \\left( \\frac{2}{R_2} - \\frac{2}{R_1 + R_2} \\right) = GM \\left( \\frac{2(R_1 + R_2) - 2R_2}{R_2(R_1 + R_2)} \\right) = \\frac{2GMR_1}{R_2(R_1 + R_2)}\n$$\nSo, the speed at apoapsis is:\n$$\nv_a = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GMR_1}{R_2(R_1 + R_2)}}\n$$\nThe second change in speed, $\\Delta v_2$, is the difference needed to accelerate from $v_a$ to the speed of the final circular orbit, $v_2$. Again, the velocities are tangential and in the same direction:\n$$\n\\Delta v_2 = v_2 - v_a = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{2GMR_1}{R_2(R_1 + R_2)}}\n$$\n\nThe total change in speed is the sum of the magnitudes of these two changes:\n$$\n\\Delta v_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta v_1 + \\Delta v_2 = \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2GMR_2}{R_1(R_1 + R_2)}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_1}} \\right) + \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_2}} - \\sqrt{\\frac{2GMR_1}{R_2(R_1 + R_2)}} \\right)\n$$\nWe can factor out common terms to make the expression clearer. For $\\Delta v_1$, we factor out $\\sqrt{GM/R_1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_1}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2R_2}{R_1 + R_2}} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nFor $\\Delta v_2$, we factor out $\\sqrt{GM/R_2}$:\n$$\n\\Delta v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_2}} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2R_1}{R_1 + R_2}} \\right)\n$$\nSumming these two gives the final expression for the total change in speed:\n$$\n\\Delta v_{\\text{total}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_1}} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2R_2}{R_1+R_2}} - 1 \\right) + \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_2}} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2R_1}{R_1+R_2}} \\right)\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_1}}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2R_2}{R_1+R_2}} - 1\\right) + \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_2}}\\left(1 - \\sqrt{\\frac{2R_1}{R_1+R_2}}\\right)}$$", "id": "2082592"}, {"introduction": "In the real world of space missions, engine performance isn't always perfect.
