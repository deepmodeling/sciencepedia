The proton has a charge of $+e$ and a mass of $m_p$. The alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus, has a charge of $+2e$ and a mass of $m_\\alpha$. The target is a single, stationary gold nucleus, which has an atomic number $Z_{Au}$ and thus a charge of $+Z_{Au}e$.\n\nBoth the proton and the alpha particle are fired from a very large distance directly towards the gold nucleus, resulting in head-on collisions. Both projectiles are prepared to have the exact same initial kinetic energy, $K_0$. Due to electrostatic repulsion, each projectile will slow down, come to a momentary stop at a certain distance from the gold nucleus, and then reverse its direction. This minimum separation distance is known as the distance of closest approach.\n\nLet $d_p$ be the distance of closest approach for the proton and $d_\\alpha$ be the distance of closest approach for the alpha particle.

We assume the gold nucleus is massive enough to be considered stationary, so its kinetic energy remains zero. The total energy of the projectile-nucleus system is the sum of the projectile's kinetic energy, $K$, and the electrostatic potential energy of the system, $U$.\n\nLet's denote the charge of the projectile as $q_{proj}$ and the charge of the target gold nucleus as $q_{Au} = Z_{Au}e$. The electrostatic potential energy between the projectile and the target when they are separated by a distance $r$ is given by $U(r) = k_e \\frac{q_{proj} q_{Au}}{r}$, where $k_e$ is the Coulomb constant.\n\nInitially, the projectile is fired from a very large distance ($r \\to \\infty$). At this point, the electrostatic potential energy is effectively zero, $U_{initial} = 0$. The projectile has an initial kinetic energy of $K_{initial} = K_0$. Therefore, the total initial energy of the system is:\n$$E_{initial} = K_{initial} + U_{initial} = K_0 + 0 = K_0$$\n\nAt the point of closest approach, the projectile momentarily comes to a halt before being repelled. At this instant, its kinetic energy is zero, $K_{final} = 0$. The distance of separation is the distance of closest approach, $d$. The potential energy at this point is $U_{final} = k_e \\frac{q_{proj} q_{Au}}{d}$. The total final energy of the system is:\n$$E_{final} = K_{final} + U_{final} = 0 + k_e \\frac{q_{proj} q_{Au}}{d} = k_e \\frac{q_{proj} q_{Au}}{d}$$\n\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$.\n$$K_0 = k_e \\frac{q_{proj} q_{Au}}{d}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the distance of closest approach, $d$:\n$$d = k_e \\frac{q_{proj} q_{Au}}{K_0}$$\n\nNow, we apply this general formula to our two specific projectiles.\n\nFor the proton, the projectile charge is $q_{proj} = q_p = +e$.
