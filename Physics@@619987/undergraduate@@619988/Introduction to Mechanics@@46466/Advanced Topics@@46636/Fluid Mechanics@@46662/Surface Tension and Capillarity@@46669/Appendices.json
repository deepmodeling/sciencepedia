A single, large spherical droplet of mercury with an initial radius $R$ is subjected to a process that causes it to break apart into eight identical, smaller spherical droplets. Assume the temperature of the mercury remains constant throughout the process and that the minimum energy required for this transformation is entirely converted into the change in the surface energy of the mercury. The surface tension of mercury is a constant, denoted by $\\gamma$.\n\nDetermine the minimum work required to cause this fragmentation.

This practice explores this phenomenon through a thought experiment involving two soap bubbles of different sizes that merge. You will determine the curvature of the dividing film between them, which reveals the non-intuitive fact that the internal pressure is greater in the smaller bubble, causing it to empty into the larger one.", "problem": "Two spherical soap bubbles are created in a chamber where the external atmospheric pressure is $P_{atm}$ and the temperature is constant. The first bubble, Bubble A, has an initial radius of $R_A$. The second bubble, Bubble B, has an initial radius of $R_B$, with $R_B  R_A$. The soap solution has a uniform surface tension of $\\sigma$.\n\nThe two bubbles are gently brought into contact until they coalesce, forming a combined system with a shared, thin, spherical dividing film between them. Assuming the process occurs isothermally and the radii of the outer surfaces of Bubble A and Bubble B remain momentarily unchanged at $R_A$ and $R_B$ respectively, determine the radius of curvature, $R_{int}$, of this newly formed internal dividing film. Express your answer as a single symbolic expression in terms of $R_A$ and $R_B$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the radius of curvature of the shared film between two coalesced soap bubbles of different radii. The key principle to solve this problem is the Young-Laplace equation, which relates the pressure difference across a curved interface to its surface tension and radii of curvature.\n\nFor a spherical soap bubble in air, there are two surfaces (an inner and an outer surface) contributing to the pressure difference. The pressure inside the bubble, $P_{in}$, is greater than the pressure outside, $P_{out}$. The Young-Laplace equation for a spherical soap bubble of radius $R$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta P = P_{in} - P_{out} = \\frac{4\\sigma}{R}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the surface tension of the soap film.\n\nLet's apply this equation to each bubble individually. The outside pressure for both bubbles is the ambient atmospheric pressure, $P_{atm}$.\n\nFor Bubble A with radius $R_A$, its internal pressure $P_A$ is:\n$$\nP_A = P_{atm} + \\frac{4\\sigma}{R_A}\n$$\n\nFor Bubble B with radius $R_B$, its internal pressure $P_B$ is:\n$$\nP_B = P_{atm} + \\frac{4\\sigma}{R_B}\n$$\n\nWhen the bubbles coalesce, they form a shared internal film. This film separates the air inside Bubble A (at pressure $P_A$) from the air inside Bubble B (at pressure $P_B$). The pressure difference across this dividing film is therefore $\\Delta P_{int} = P_A - P_B$.\n\nSince we are given that $R_B  R_A$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{R_A}  \\frac{1}{R_B}$. Consequently, $P_A  P_B$. This means the pressure inside the smaller bubble is greater than the pressure inside the larger bubble. As a result, the shared film will be curved, bulging into the region of lower pressure (Bubble B). Its center of curvature will therefore be located inside Bubble A.\n\nThe shared film is itself a soap film with two surfaces, so the Young-Laplace equation applies to it as well. Let the radius of curvature of this interface film be $R_{int}$. The pressure difference it sustains is related to its curvature by:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{int} = P_A - P_B = \\frac{4\\sigma}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $P_A$ and $P_B$ into this equation:\n$$\n\\left( P_{atm} + \\frac{4\\sigma}{R_A} \\right) - \\left( P_{atm} + \\frac{4\\sigma}{R_B} \\right) = \\frac{4\\sigma}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nThe atmospheric pressure terms $P_{atm}$ cancel out:\n$$\n\\frac{4\\sigma}{R_A} - \\frac{4\\sigma}{R_B} = \\frac{4\\sigma}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by the common factor of $4\\sigma$ (since $\\sigma \\neq 0$):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{R_A} - \\frac{1}{R_B} = \\frac{1}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nTo solve for $R_{int}$, we first combine the terms on the left-hand side with a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{R_B - R_A}{R_A R_B} = \\frac{1}{R_{int}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to find the expression for $R_{int}$:\n$$\nR_{int} = \\frac{R_A R_B}{R_B - R_A}\n$$\nThis expression gives the radius of curvature of the internal dividing film.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R_A R_B}{R_B - R_A}}$$", "id": "1796124"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to apply your understanding of surface tension to the phenomenon of capillarity, where the upward pull of surface forces is balanced by the downward pull of gravity.
