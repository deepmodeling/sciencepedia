The air is transported through a rectangular ducting system. A stream of air initially enters a duct section of uniform width $W$ and height $H_1$. In this section, the air moves at a steady speed $v_1$ and has an absolute temperature $T_1$. The air then passes through an in-line electric heating grid that spans the entire cross-section of the duct, raising the air's absolute temperature to a new uniform value $T_2$. Immediately following the heating grid, the duct transitions to a new section with the same width $W$ but a reduced height $H_2$.\n\nAssuming the air can be treated as an ideal gas and that the pressure remains constant throughout the entire process, derive an expression for the new speed of the air, $v_2$, in the narrower section of the duct. Your expression should be in terms of $v_1$, $H_1$, $H_2$, $T_1$, and $T_2$.", "solution": "The fundamental principle governing the flow of the air is the conservation of mass. For a steady flow in a duct, the mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}$, must be constant at all points along the flow. The mass flow rate is defined as the product of the fluid density ($\\rho$), the cross-sectional area of the flow ($A$), and the average speed of the fluid ($v$).\n\nLet the quantities in the initial section be denoted by subscript 1 and the quantities in the final section be denoted by subscript 2. According to the principle of mass conservation:\n$$ \\dot{m}_1 = \\dot{m}_2 $$\nSubstituting the definition of mass flow rate, we get:\n$$ \\rho_1 A_1 v_1 = \\rho_2 A_2 v_2 $$\nWe are asked to find the final speed, $v_2$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $v_2$:\n$$ v_2 = v_1 \\frac{\\rho_1 A_1}{\\rho_2 A_2} $$\nThe duct has a rectangular cross-section. The initial area $A_1$ is given by the product of its width and height, $A_1 = W H_1$. The final area $A_2$ is similarly given by $A_2 = W H_2$. We can compute the ratio of the areas:\n$$ \\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \\frac{W H_1}{W H_2} = \\frac{H_1}{H_2} $$\nNext, we need to find the ratio of the densities, $\\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}$. The problem states that the air can be treated as an ideal gas. The ideal gas law is given by:\n$$ PV = nRT $$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nWe can express this equation in terms of density, $\\rho$. The number of moles $n$ can be written as the total mass $m$ divided by the molar mass $M$ of the gas, so $n = m/M$. Substituting this into the ideal gas law gives:\n$$ PV = \\frac{m}{M}RT $$\nDensity is defined as mass per unit volume, $\\rho = m/V$. We can rearrange the equation to get an expression involving density:\n$$ P = \\frac{m}{V} \\frac{RT}{M} = \\rho \\frac{RT}{M} $$\nSolving for the density $\\rho$, we find:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{PM}{RT} $$\nThe problem states that the pressure $P$ is constant throughout the process. The molar mass $M$ of the air and the gas constant $R$ are also constants. Therefore, the density is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature, $\\rho \\propto \\frac{1}{T}$.\n\nUsing this relationship, we can find the ratio of the densities $\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_2$:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} = \\frac{\\frac{PM}{RT_1}}{\\frac{PM}{RT_2}} = \\frac{T_2}{T_1} $$\nNow we can substitute the ratios for the areas and densities back into our expression for $v_2$:\n$$ v_2 = v_1 \\left( \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{A_1}{A_2} \\right) $$\n$$ v_2 = v_1 \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{H_1}{H_2} \\right) $$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$ v_2 = v_1 \\frac{H_1 T_2}{H_2 T_1} $$\nThis expression gives the final speed of the air in the second section of the duct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{v_1 \\frac{H_1 T_2}{H_2 T_1}}$$", "id": "2219881"}, {"introduction": "For many liquids, such as water, we can simplify our analysis by assuming the fluid is incompressible, meaning its density $\\rho$ is constant.

These conduits are designed with a semi-circular cross-section, each having a radius of $R = 4.00$ m.
