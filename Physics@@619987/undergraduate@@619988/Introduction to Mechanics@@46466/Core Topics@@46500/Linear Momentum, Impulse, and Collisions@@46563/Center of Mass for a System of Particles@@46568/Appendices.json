The main structure consists of a rigid, massless square frame of side length $L$. Four decorative objects, treated as point masses, are to be placed at the vertices of this square. Let's orient the square in a Cartesian coordinate system such that its vertices are at the locations A: $(0, L)$, B: $(L, L)$, C: $(L, 0)$, and D: $(0, 0)$. The masses for three of the objects are predetermined: the mass at A is $m_A = 2m_0$, the mass at B is $m_B = m_0$, and the mass at C is $m_C = 2m_0$, where $m_0$ is a positive constant representing a base unit of mass. The artist needs to determine the mass for the object at vertex D, $m_D$, such that the center of mass of the four-object system is located precisely at the geometric center of the square frame. What is the required value of $m_D$ in terms of $m_0$?", "solution": "The problem asks for the mass $m_D$ of an object at vertex D such that the center of mass of a four-particle system is at the geometric center of the square on which they are placed.\n\nFirst, let's identify the given information. We have four particles with the following masses and position vectors:\n- Particle A: $m_A = 2m_0$, $\\vec{r}_A = 0\\hat{i} + L\\hat{j}$\n- Particle B: $m_B = m_0$, $\\vec{r}_B = L\\hat{i} + L\\hat{j}$\n- Particle C: $m_C = 2m_0$, $\\vec{r}_C = L\\hat{i} + 0\\hat{j}$\n- Particle D: $m_D$ (unknown), $\\vec{r}_D = 0\\hat{i} + 0\\hat{j}$\n\nThe total mass of the system is $M = m_A + m_B + m_C + m_D = 2m_0 + m_0 + 2m_0 + m_D = 5m_0 + m_D$.\n\nNext, we determine the coordinates of the geometric center of the square. The vertices are at $(0,0)$, $(L,0)$, $(L,L)$, and $(0,L)$. The geometric center is the average of the vertex coordinates:\n$x_{center} = \\frac{0 + L + L + 0}{4} = \\frac{2L}{4} = \\frac{L}{2}$\n$y_{center} = \\frac{0 + 0 + L + L}{4} = \\frac{2L}{4} = \\frac{L}{2}$\nSo, the desired location of the center of mass is $\\vec{r}_{CM} = \\frac{L}{2}\\hat{i} + \\frac{L}{2}\\hat{j}$.\n\nThe position of the center of mass, $\\vec{r}_{CM}$, for a system of particles is given by the formula:\n$$ \\vec{r}_{CM} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} m_i \\vec{r}_i}{\\sum_{i} m_i} = \\frac{m_A \\vec{r}_A + m_B \\vec{r}_B + m_C \\vec{r}_C + m_D \\vec{r}_D}{M} $$\n\nWe can decompose this into x and y components. The x-coordinate of the center of mass is:\n$$ x_{CM} = \\frac{m_A x_A + m_B x_B + m_C x_C + m_D x_D}{M} $$\nWe require $x_{CM} = \\frac{L}{2}$. Substituting the known values:\n$$ \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{(2m_0)(0) + (m_0)(L) + (2m_0)(L) + (m_D)(0)}{5m_0 + m_D} $$\n$$ \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{0 + m_0 L + 2m_0 L + 0}{5m_0 + m_D} $$\n$$ \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{3m_0 L}{5m_0 + m_D} $$\nTo solve for $m_D$, we can cross-multiply. Note that $L \\neq 0$.\n$$ L(5m_0 + m_D) = 2(3m_0 L) $$\n$$ 5m_0 L + m_D L = 6m_0 L $$\nWe can divide the entire equation by $L$:\n$$ 5m_0 + m_D = 6m_0 $$\n$$ m_D = 6m_0 - 5m_0 $$\n$$ m_D = m_0 $$\n\nNow, let's check this result using the y-coordinate of the center of mass. The y-coordinate is:\n$$ y_{CM} = \\frac{m_A y_A + m_B y_B + m_C y_C + m_D y_D}{M} $$\nWe require $y_{CM} = \\frac{L}{2}$. Substituting the known values:\n$$ \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{(2m_0)(L) + (m_0)(L) + (2m_0)(0) + (m_D)(0)}{5m_0 + m_D} $$\n$$ \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{2m_0 L + m_0 L + 0 + 0}{5m_0 + m_D} $$\n$$ \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{3m_0 L}{5m_0 + m_D} $$\nThis equation is identical to the one we derived for the x-component. It will therefore yield the same solution for $m_D$:\n$$ L(5m_0 + m_D) = 2(3m_0 L) \\implies 5m_0 + m_D = 6m_0 \\implies m_D = m_0 $$\nSince both the x and y component conditions are satisfied with the same value of $m_D$, this is our unique solution. The required mass for the object at vertex D is $m_0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{m_0}$$", "id": "2181450"}, {"introduction": "Calculating the center of mass for complex shapes can often be simplified using the principle of superposition.
