By analyzing the motion of a person and a package within a canoe, you will learn to apply this conservation law to a multi-body system and understand why the final state is independent of complex internal motions like walking. This exercise reinforces the importance of correctly defining your system and recognizing that with no net external horizontal forces, the total momentum of the system remains constant.", "problem": "A symmetric canoe of mass $M$ and length $L$ is initially at rest, floating on calm water. A person of mass $m$, initially positioned at the bow of the canoe, is holding a package of mass $m_p$. The person walks from the bow to the stern. Immediately upon reaching the stern, the person heaves the package horizontally backward (away from the canoe) with a speed $v_{rel}$ relative to the person. The person then remains stationary at the stern of the canoe. Assume that the water offers no resistance to the horizontal motion of the canoe.\n\nDetermine the final velocity of the canoe relative to the water. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $m$, $M$, $m_p$, and $v_{rel}$.", "solution": "Choose a horizontal axis with the positive direction from stern to bow. There are no external horizontal forces on the closed system (canoe + person + package), so total horizontal momentum is conserved at all times. Initially, the system is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero.\n\nImmediately after the throw, the person remains stationary relative to the canoe, so the person and the canoe move together with some common velocity $V_{f}$ relative to the water. The package is heaved backward with speed $v_{rel}$ relative to the person, so its velocity relative to the water is $V_{f}-v_{rel}$.\n\nConservation of total horizontal momentum between the initial state and the final state gives\n$$\n0 = M V_{f} + m V_{f} + m_{p}\\left(V_{f} - v_{rel}\\right).\n$$\nCollect terms in $V_{f}$:\n$$\n0 = \\left(M + m + m_{p}\\right) V_{f} - m_{p} v_{rel}.\n$$\nSolve for $V_{f}$:\n$$\nV_{f} = \\frac{m_{p} v_{rel}}{M + m + m_{p}}.\n$$\nThis result is independent of any details of the prior walking because the total momentum of the closed system remains zero throughout.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{m_{p} v_{rel}}{M + m + m_{p}}}$$", "id": "2199451"}, {"introduction": "Real-world physical events often occur in stages, each governed by different principles. This problem masterfully combines a perfectly inelastic collision with a subsequent phase of motion under friction, compelling a careful analytical approach. You will first apply the conservation of linear momentum to the instantaneous collision, where external forces are negligible compared to the large internal impact forces. You will then use the work-energy theorem or Newton's second law to analyze the subsequent deceleration caused by the constant external frictional force. This practice is essential for developing the skill to identify which physical laws are applicable during different phases of a complex process.", "problem": "A stationary composite block rests on a rough horizontal surface. The block consists of two parts, A and B, with masses $M_A$ and $M_B$ respectively, held together by a weak, massless adhesive. A bullet of mass $m$ is fired horizontally with an initial velocity $v_0$ and strikes part A head-on. The bullet embeds itself perfectly inelastically within part A. The impact is assumed to be instantaneous and provides sufficient impulse to break the adhesive bond, leaving part B at rest at its initial location. The combined mass of the bullet and part A then slides across the surface. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the sliding mass and the surface is $\\mu_k$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the total distance, $D$, that the combined mass (bullet and part A) slides before coming to a complete stop.", "solution": "1.

The chain has a linear mass density of $\\lambda$ and is initially coiled in a neat pile on the factory floor. A robotic arm grasps one end of the chain and pulls it vertically upwards, such that the end of the chain moves with a constant velocity $v$.

At the instant when the top end is at height $H$, the length of chain that is moving is $H$, so its mass is\n$$m(H) = \\lambda H.$$\nThe external forces on this moving portion are the upward force $F$ exerted by the robotic arm and the downward weight\n$$W = \\lambda g H.$$\nWe treat the moving chain as an open system that gains mass from the pile.
