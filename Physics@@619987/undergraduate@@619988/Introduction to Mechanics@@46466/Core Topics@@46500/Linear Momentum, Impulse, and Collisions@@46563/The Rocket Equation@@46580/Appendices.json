Therefore, the final mass of the rocket, $m_f$, is identical to its initial mass, $m_0$.\nWe substitute this condition, $m_f = m_0$, into the Tsiolkovsky equation:\n$$ \\Delta v_A = u \\ln\\left(\\frac{m_{0}}{m_{0}}\\right) $$\nThe ratio of the masses is $\\frac{m_0}{m_0} = 1$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta v_A = u \\ln(1) $$\nThe natural logarithm of 1 is 0.\n$$ \\Delta v_A = u \\times 0 = 0 $$\nSo, for Case A, the predicted change in velocity is 0. This is physically intuitive: with no expulsion of mass, there is no thrust, and thus no acceleration or change in velocity.\n\n**Analysis of Case B:**\nIn this case, the rocket has a structure of negligible mass. The initial mass is the sum of the fuel mass, $m_{fuel}$, and the payload mass, $m_p$, so $m_0 = m_{fuel} + m_p$. The final mass is just the payload, so $m_f = m_p$.\nThe problem asks us to consider the limit where an \"almost infinite\" amount of fuel is used. Mathematically, this corresponds to the limit as $m_{fuel} \\to \\infty$.\nFirst, let's express the mass ratio $\\frac{m_0}{m_f}$ in terms of $m_{fuel}$ and $m_p$:\n$$ \\frac{m_0}{m_f} = \\frac{m_{fuel} + m_p}{m_p} = \\frac{m_{fuel}}{m_p} + 1 $$\nNow we can evaluate the limit of the velocity change $\\Delta v$ as $m_{fuel} \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\Delta v_B = \\lim_{m_{fuel} \\to \\infty} u \\ln\\left(\\frac{m_{fuel}}{m_p} + 1\\right) $$\nAs $m_{fuel}$ approaches infinity (while $m_p$ remains a finite, positive mass), the term $\\frac{m_{fuel}}{m_p}$ also approaches infinity. Therefore, the argument of the natural logarithm, $\\left(\\frac{m_{fuel}}{m_p} + 1\\right)$, approaches infinity.\nThe natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, approaches infinity as its argument $x$ approaches infinity.\nThus, the predicted change in velocity for Case B is:\n$$ \\Delta v_B \\to u \\times (\\infty) \\to \\infty $$\nThe equation predicts an infinite change in velocity. This is a non-physical result because velocities cannot exceed the speed of light, a constraint not built into the non-relativistic Tsiolkovsky equation. It highlights that the equation is an idealization and breaks down under such extreme (and impossible) conditions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe have found that for Case A, $\\Delta v = 0$, and for Case B, $\\Delta v \\to \\infty$.\nLet's compare this with the given options:\nA.
