The angle between $\\vec{v}_0$ and $\\vec{v}_1$ is the deflection angle $\\theta$.\n\nThe initial kinetic energy of the system is entirely in the incident puck: $K_0 = \\frac{1}{2} m |\\vec{v}_0|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2$.\nThe final kinetic energy of the incident puck is $K_1 = \\frac{1}{2} m |\\vec{v}_1|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_1^2$.\n\nWe are given that the final kinetic energy of the incident puck is a fraction $f$ of its initial kinetic energy:\n$$K_1 = f K_0$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} m v_1^2 = f \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 \\right)$$\n$$v_1^2 = f v_0^2 \\implies v_1 = v_0 \\sqrt{f}$$\n\nSince the collision is perfectly elastic, the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved.\n$$K_0 = K_1 + K_2$$\nwhere $K_2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_2^2$ is the final kinetic energy of the target puck.\n$$\\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v_2^2$$\n$$v_0^2 = v_1^2 + v_2^2$$\nSubstituting $v_1^2 = f v_0^2$ into the energy conservation equation gives:\n$$v_0^2 = f v_0^2 + v_2^2 \\implies v_2^2 = v_0^2 (1-f) \\implies v_2 = v_0 \\sqrt{1-f}$$\n\nNext, we apply the principle of conservation of linear momentum.
