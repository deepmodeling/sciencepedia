The horizontal component of the gravitational force on the block is zero, as gravity acts purely in the vertical direction.\n2.  The horizontal component of the gravitational force on the wedge is zero, for the same reason.\n3.  The horizontal component of the normal force from the ground on the wedge is zero, as this force is perpendicular to the horizontal surface.\n\nSince all external forces acting on the system are purely vertical, the net external force in the horizontal direction is zero.\n$$ F_{\\text{net, ext}, x} = 0 $$\nSubstituting this into the horizontal component of Newton's second law for the system:\n$$ 0 = (M+m) a_{\\text{CM}, x} $$\nSince the total mass $(M+m)$ is not zero, the horizontal component of the acceleration of the center of mass must be zero.\n$$ a_{\\text{CM}, x} = 0 $$\nThis result is independent of the masses $m, M$, the angle $\\theta$, and the acceleration due to gravity $g$, as long as there are no external horizontal forces.
