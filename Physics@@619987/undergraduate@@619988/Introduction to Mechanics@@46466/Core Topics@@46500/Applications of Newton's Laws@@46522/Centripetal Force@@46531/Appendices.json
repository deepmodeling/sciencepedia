This exercise [@problem_id:2182781] challenges you to analyze the forces at play at the highest and lowest points of a vertical circle, linking centripetal acceleration to the familiar forces of gravity and normal force. By exploring how a passenger's apparent weight changes, you will gain a deeper, intuitive understanding of how net force dictates circular motion and how this interplay is connected to the conservation of energy.", "problem": "A design engineer is analyzing the forces on a passenger of mass $m$ riding in a roller coaster car that navigates a vertical circular loop of radius $R$. The design specification requires that the speed of the car at the absolute apex of the loop, $v_{\\text{top}}$, is precisely a factor of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{5}$ times the minimum critical speed, $v_{\\text{crit}}$, at which the car would just maintain contact with the track. Assuming the roller coaster car and passenger system can be treated as a point mass and that mechanical energy is conserved throughout its motion within the loop, determine the ratio of the passenger's apparent weight at the very bottom of the loop to their true weight. Let $g$ denote the acceleration due to gravity. The final answer should be a single real number.", "solution": "At the top of the loop, the minimum critical speed is defined by the loss of contact condition $N_{\\text{top}}=0$.

In this thought experiment [@problem_id:2182772], you will determine the precise angle at which a sliding droplet detaches from a spherical surface. The key insight is to recognize that contact is lost when the normal force, one of the forces contributing to the required centripetal acceleration, becomes zero, providing a powerful problem-solving condition.", "problem": "In a materials science laboratory, a novel coating process is being studied. A small droplet of a special polymer, with mass $m$, is deposited at the apex of a large, stationary, frictionless spherical mold of radius $R$. An automated system then imparts a precise initial horizontal velocity $v_0$ to the droplet, causing it to slide down the side of the mold. The droplet will eventually lose contact with the spherical surface and fly off tangentially. Assuming the acceleration due to gravity is $g$, determine a symbolic expression for the cosine of the angle $\\theta$ at which the droplet loses contact with the mold. The angle $\\theta$ is defined with respect to the vertical axis passing through the center of the spherical mold, with $\\theta=0$ at the apex.", "solution": "Let the droplet slide on the outside of a fixed, frictionless sphere of radius $R$.
