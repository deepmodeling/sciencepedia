A central block of mass $M$ rests on a rough horizontal surface. This central block is connected by two light, inextensible strings to two other blocks. The first string passes over a frictionless, massless pulley at one end of the surface and is attached to a hanging block of mass $m_1$. The second string passes over another frictionless, massless pulley at the opposite end of the surface and is attached to a second hanging block of mass $m_2$. The system is initially at rest. Assuming that $m_1 > m_2$, determine the minimum coefficient of static friction, $\\mu_s$, between the central block and the surface that is required to prevent any part of the system from moving. Your final answer should be a symbolic expression in terms of $M$, $m_1$, and $m_2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum coefficient of static friction, $\\mu_s$, that will keep the system in equilibrium. This means the net force on each of the three blocks must be zero, according to Newton's First Law. We will analyze the forces on each block individually. Let $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFirst, consider the hanging block of mass $m_1$. There are two forces acting on it: the gravitational force $m_1 g$ acting downwards, and the tension $T_1$ from the string acting upwards. For the block to be in equilibrium, these forces must balance:\n$$ T_1 - m_1 g = 0 $$\n$$ T_1 = m_1 g $$\n\nNext, consider the hanging block of mass $m_2$. Similarly, there are two forces acting on it: the gravitational force $m_2 g$ acting downwards, and the tension $T_2$ from the second string acting upwards. For equilibrium:\n$$ T_2 - m_2 g = 0 $$\n$$ T_2 = m_2 g $$\n\nNow, we analyze the forces on the central block of mass $M$. In the vertical direction, we have the gravitational force $Mg$ acting downwards and the normal force $N$ from the surface acting upwards. Since there is no vertical motion, these forces must be equal:\n$$ N - Mg = 0 $$\n$$ N = Mg $$\n\nIn the horizontal direction, there are three forces. The tension $T_1$ pulls the block in one direction (let's call this the positive direction), the tension $T_2$ pulls in the opposite (negative) direction, and the force of static friction, $f_s$, acts to oppose the impending motion. Since the problem states that $m_1 > m_2$, it follows that $T_1 > T_2$. Therefore, the system has a tendency to move in the direction of the pull from $T_1$. The static friction force $f_s$ must oppose this tendency, so it acts in the same direction as $T_2$ (the negative direction). The condition for static equilibrium in the horizontal direction is:\n$$ T_1 - T_2 - f_s = 0 $$\n\nWe are looking for the *minimum* coefficient of static friction, $\\mu_s$, that prevents motion. This minimum value corresponds to the limiting case where the static friction force reaches its maximum possible value, $f_{s, \\text{max}}$. The maximum static friction is related to the normal force and the coefficient of static friction by the equation:\n$$ f_s = f_{s, \\text{max}} = \\mu_s N $$\n\nSubstituting this into the horizontal force balance equation:\n$$ T_1 - T_2 - \\mu_s N = 0 $$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $T_1$, $T_2$, and $N$ that we found earlier:\n$$ m_1 g - m_2 g - \\mu_s (Mg) = 0 $$\n\nOur goal is to solve for $\\mu_s$. We can first factor out $g$ from the terms on the left side:\n$$ g(m_1 - m_2) - \\mu_s M g = 0 $$\n\nWe can rearrange the equation to isolate the term with $\\mu_s$:\n$$ \\mu_s M g = g(m_1 - m_2) $$\n\nSince $g$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $g$. Also, assuming $M$ is non-zero, we can divide by $M$:\n$$ \\mu_s M = m_1 - m_2 $$\n$$ \\mu_s = \\frac{m_1 - m_2}{M} $$\nThis expression gives the minimum coefficient of static friction required to keep the system in equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{m_1 - m_2}{M}}$$", "id": "2200012"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of equilibrium, this problem introduces the complexity of multiple contact surfaces. When a force is applied to one part of a stacked system, friction forces are generated at every interface [@problem_id:2184166]. Your challenge is to dissect the system, calculate the maximum possible static friction at each level, and identify which surface is the 'weakest link' that will slip first as the applied force increases.", "problem": "In an automated assembly line, a robotic manipulator is tasked with positioning a component built from three identical, solid cubic modules. The modules are stacked one on top of another, resting on a flat, horizontal workstation surface. Each module has a mass of $m = 1.25$ kg. The coefficient of static friction, $\\mu_s$, is the same between any two surfaces in contact (module-on-module and module-on-surface), and its value is $\\mu_s = 0.350$. To adjust the component's alignment, the manipulator applies a strictly horizontal force, $F$, to the center of the middle module.\n\nAssuming the force is applied gradually, determine the maximum magnitude of $F$ that can be exerted before any slipping occurs at any of the surfaces.

The bottom module rests on the ground (G). Let the mass of each module be $m$, and let the direction of the applied force $F$ be the positive x-direction.\n\nFirst, we determine the normal forces at each interface by considering the weight they must support:\n- Between Top and Middle (T-M): $N_{TM}$ supports one block, so $N_{TM} = mg$.\n- Between Middle and Bottom (M-B): $N_{MB}$ supports two blocks (T and M), so $N_{MB} = (m+m)g = 2mg$.\n- Between Bottom and Ground (B-G): $N_{BG}$ supports all three blocks, so $N_{BG} = (m+m+m)g = 3mg$.\n\nThe maximum static friction force, $f_{s,max}$, at each interface is $f_{s,max} = \\mu_s N$:\n- $f_{TM,max} = \\mu_s N_{TM} = \\mu_s mg$\n- $f_{MB,max} = \\mu_s N_{MB} = 2\\mu_s mg$\n- $f_{BG,max} = \\mu_s N_{BG} = 3\\mu_s mg$\n\nNow, we analyze the horizontal forces required for static equilibrium (net force is zero) for each block, starting from the top. Let $f_{XY}$ denote the magnitude of the friction force between surfaces X and Y.\n- **Top block (T):** The only potential horizontal force is the friction from the middle block. For equilibrium, $f_{MT} = 0$.\n- **Middle block (M):** The applied force $F$ acts in the +x direction. It is opposed by the friction force from the bottom block, $f_{BM}$, and the friction force from the top block. By Newton's 3rd Law, the force exerted by T on M is also zero since $f_{MT}=0$. So, the equilibrium equation is:\n$$ F - f_{BM} = 0 \\implies f_{BM} = F $$\n- **Bottom block (B):** This block is pushed in the +x direction by the reaction force from the middle block, which has a magnitude of $f_{BM} = F$. This is opposed by the friction from the ground, $f_{BG}$. The equilibrium equation is:\n$$ F - f_{BG} = 0 \\implies f_{BG} = F $$\n\nSo, for the system to remain static, we require friction forces of magnitude $f_{BM} = F$ and $f_{BG} = F$. We must compare these required forces to the maximum available static friction at each interface. Slipping will occur when a required force exceeds the maximum possible force.\n- Interface T-M: Required $f_{MT}=0$. This is less than $f_{TM,max}$, so this interface is stable.\n- Interface M-B: Requires $f_{BM}=F$. We need $F \\le f_{MB,max}$, so $F \\le 2\\mu_s mg$.\n- Interface B-G: Requires $f_{BG}=F$. We need $F \\le f_{BG,max}$, so $F \\le 3\\mu_s mg$.\n\nThe condition that will be violated first as $F$ increases is the one with the lowest threshold. Since $2\\mu_s mg  3\\mu_s mg$, the middle block will slip on the bottom block first.

This force can act in either the positive or negative horizontal direction, opposing the tendency of motion.\n\nFor the block to be in static equilibrium at a position $x$, the net horizontal force on it must be zero. Let's define the positive direction to be the direction of the applied force $F_0$. The spring force is a restoring force, so it is given by $F_s = -kx$.
