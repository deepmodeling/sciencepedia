The key insight here is that the centripetal force, $F_c = m a_c$, is not a fundamental force of nature but is the net force provided by other interactions. In this problem [@problem_id:2188506], it is the horizontal component of the normal force that directs the bead in its circular path, making this an excellent exercise in vector decomposition and the application of Newton's second law.", "problem": "A small, smooth bead of mass $m$ is constrained to move on the inner surface of an inverted cone. The cone has a half-angle $\\theta$ with respect to its vertical axis of symmetry. The bead is observed to move in a stable, horizontal circular path at a constant vertical height $h$ above the apex of the cone. Assume the acceleration due to gravity is $g$, and that any frictional forces are negligible. Derive an expression for the period of revolution, $T$, of the bead in terms of $h$, $g$, and $\\theta$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will analyze the forces acting on the bead and apply Newton's second law for uniform circular motion.\n\nFirst, let's identify the forces acting on the bead. There are two forces:\n1.  The gravitational force, $\\vec{F}_g$, with magnitude $mg$, acting vertically downwards.\n2.  The normal force, $\\vec{N}$, exerted by the inner surface of the cone on the bead. This force is perpendicular to the surface of the cone.\n\nThe bead is moving in a horizontal circle at a constant speed, so it is undergoing uniform circular motion. The net force on the bead must provide the necessary centripetal force, which is directed horizontally towards the center of the circle. Let's set up a coordinate system with the origin at the center of the circular path, the y-axis pointing vertically upwards, and the x-axis pointing radially inwards towards the center of the circle.\n\nThe gravitational force is entirely in the vertical direction: $\\vec{F}_g = -mg \\hat{j}$.\n\nThe normal force $\\vec{N}$ is perpendicular to the cone's surface. Since the cone's wall makes an angle $\\theta$ with the vertical axis, the normal force vector makes an angle of $(90^\\circ - \\theta)$ with the vertical axis. Equivalently, the normal force vector makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal axis. We can resolve the normal force into its horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components:\n- The horizontal component, $N_x$, points towards the center of the circle and provides the centripetal force: $N_x = N \\cos(\\theta)$.\n- The vertical component, $N_y$, points upwards and balances the force of gravity: $N_y = N \\sin(\\theta)$.\n\nNow, we apply Newton's second law, $\\sum \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}$, to both directions.\n\nIn the vertical (y) direction, the bead has no acceleration, so the net force is zero:\n$$ \\sum F_y = N_y - mg = 0 $$\n$$ N \\sin(\\theta) - mg = 0 $$\nSolving for the magnitude of the normal force, $N$:\n$$ N = \\frac{mg}{\\sin(\\theta)} $$\n\nIn the horizontal (x) direction, the net force is the centripetal force, $F_c = ma_c$, where $a_c$ is the centripetal acceleration. The radius of the circular path is $r$. The speed of the bead is $v$. The centripetal acceleration is $a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r}$.\n$$ \\sum F_x = N_x = m a_c $$\n$$ N \\cos(\\theta) = m \\frac{v^2}{r} $$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations. We can substitute the expression for $N$ from the vertical analysis into the horizontal equation:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{mg}{\\sin(\\theta)} \\right) \\cos(\\theta) = m \\frac{v^2}{r} $$\nThe mass $m$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ g \\frac{\\cos(\\theta)}{\\sin(\\theta)} = \\frac{v^2}{r} $$\n$$ g \\cot(\\theta) = \\frac{v^2}{r} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the period of revolution, $T$. The period is related to the speed $v$ and radius $r$ by $v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}$. We can substitute this into our equation:\n$$ g \\cot(\\theta) = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\right)^2}{r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2 r} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r}{T^2} $$\nWe can now solve for $T^2$:\n$$ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r}{g \\cot(\\theta)} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r \\tan(\\theta)}{g} $$\n\nThe final step is to express the radius $r$ in terms of the given height $h$ and angle $\\theta$. From the geometry of the cone, the height $h$, the radius $r$, and the cone wall form a right-angled triangle. The angle opposite to the side of length $r$ is $\\theta$. Thus, we have the relation:\n$$ \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{r}{h} \\implies r = h \\tan(\\theta) $$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $r$ into our equation for $T^2$:\n$$ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 (h \\tan(\\theta)) \\tan(\\theta)}{g} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 h \\tan^2(\\theta)}{g} $$\n\nFinally, we take the square root of both sides to find the period $T$:\n$$ T = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi^2 h \\tan^2(\\theta)}{g}} = 2\\pi |\\tan(\\theta)| \\sqrt{\\frac{h}{g}} $$\nSince $\\theta$ is the half-angle of a cone, it is physically constrained to be in the range $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, for which $\\tan(\\theta)$ is positive. Therefore, the absolute value is not necessary.\n$$ T = 2\\pi \\tan(\\theta) \\sqrt{\\frac{h}{g}} $$\nThis is the final expression for the period of revolution.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2\\pi \\tan(\\theta) \\sqrt{\\frac{h}{g}}} $$", "id": "2188506"}, {"introduction": "We now add another layer of complexity by examining motion in a vertical circle, where the speed of the object is no longer constant due to the influence of gravity.
