This first exercise directly confronts that notion by illustrating that the normal force is a responsive constraint force, adjusting its magnitude based on all other perpendicular forces acting on the surface. By analyzing the vertical forces on a cart subjected to an angled external pull [@problem_id:2221924], you will practice isolating force components to correctly determine the normal force, reinforcing the understanding that it is not a fixed value but a reaction to a specific physical situation.", "problem": "In a physics laboratory, a setup is designed to study dynamics. A cart of mass $M$ rests on a long, flat, horizontal track. It is connected by a light, inextensible string that passes over an ideal, frictionless pulley to a block of mass $m$, which hangs vertically. To initiate and sustain motion, a constant external force of magnitude $F$ is applied to the cart at a constant angle $\\theta$ below the horizontal. The system begins to accelerate from rest. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the cart and the track is $\\mu_k$.\n\nYour task is to determine the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the track on the cart. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of any or all of the given parameters $M$, $m$, $F$, $\\theta$, $\\mu_k$, and the acceleration due to gravity $g$.", "solution": "Choose a right-handed coordinate system with the $x$-axis horizontal along the track and the $y$-axis vertical upward. Consider the free-body diagram of the cart of mass $M$.\n\nForces on the cart:\n- Weight: $Mg$ downward.\n- Normal force from the track: $N$ upward.\n- Applied force of magnitude $F$ at angle $\\theta$ below the horizontal: horizontal component $F\\cos\\theta$ (along $x$), vertical component $F\\sin\\theta$ downward (along $-y$).\n- Kinetic friction of magnitude $f_{k}=\\mu_{k}N$ acting along the track, opposing the direction of motion (purely horizontal).\n- String tension from the hanging mass acts purely horizontally on the cart (the string segment along the track is horizontal), so it has no vertical component.\n\nThe cart does not accelerate vertically, so its vertical acceleration is zero. Applying Newton’s second law in the vertical direction gives\n$$\n\\sum F_{y}=Ma_{y}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad N - Mg - F\\sin\\theta = 0.\n$$\nSolving for the normal force yields\n$$\nN = Mg + F\\sin\\theta.\n$$\nThis result is independent of $m$ and $\\mu_{k}$ because neither affects the vertical force balance on the cart.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{Mg+F\\sin\\theta}$$", "id": "2221924"}, {"introduction": "Building on the understanding that the normal force is responsive, we now investigate how it behaves within an accelerating reference frame. The sensation of feeling 'heavier' or 'lighter' in an elevator is a direct consequence of the changing normal force exerted by the floor. This practice [@problem_id:2221927] challenges you to apply this principle by calculating the normal force between two blocks on an inclined plane inside an accelerating elevator, thereby integrating the concept of apparent weight with the vector component analysis required for inclined surfaces.", "problem": "Two rectangular blocks are stacked one on top of the other and placed on a frictionless ramp. The top block has a mass $m_1$ and the bottom block has a mass $m_2$. The ramp is inclined at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. The entire setup, including the ramp and the blocks, is located inside an elevator which is accelerating vertically upwards with a constant acceleration of magnitude $a$. The blocks are observed to slide down the ramp together without slipping relative to each other. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$. Determine the magnitude of the normal force exerted by the bottom block (mass $m_2$) on the top block (mass $m_1$). Express your answer in terms of $m_1$, $g$, $a$, and $\\theta$.", "solution": "Work in the non-inertial frame of the elevator, which is accelerating vertically upward with constant acceleration of magnitude $a$. In this frame, each mass experiences, in addition to real forces, a fictitious inertial force of magnitude $m a$ directed downward (opposite the elevator’s acceleration). For the top block of mass $m_{1}$, the downward forces are gravity $m_{1}g$ and the inertial force $m_{1}a$, so the combined effective downward force is equivalent to an effective gravitational field of magnitude $g_{\\text{eff}}=g+a$.\n\nLet the incline make an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal. Decompose forces perpendicular to the plane. The normal force $N$ exerted by the bottom block on the top block acts perpendicular to the plane, and the component of the effective weight $m_{1}(g+a)$ perpendicular to the plane is $m_{1}(g+a)\\cos\\theta$ pressing the blocks together. Because the top block remains in contact with the bottom block and the plane is at rest in this frame, the acceleration of the top block perpendicular to the plane is zero.

Its motion, relative to the stationary container, is characterized by a constant upward vertical acceleration, $a_y$, and a constant angular velocity, $\\omega$, about the central axis of the cylinder. The container itself does not move or tilt. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the reading on the scale.
