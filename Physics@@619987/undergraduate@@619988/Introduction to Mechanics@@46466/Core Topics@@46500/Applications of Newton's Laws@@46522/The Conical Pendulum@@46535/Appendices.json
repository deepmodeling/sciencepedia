Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the initial angular velocity $\\omega_1$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the final angular velocity $\\omega_2$ of a bob moving in a horizontal circle after its radius of rotation is changed.\n\nStep 1: Identify the system and the relevant physical principles.\nThe system is the bob of mass $m$. The forces acting on the bob are gravity (acting vertically downwards), the normal force from the table (acting vertically upwards), and the tension in the string (acting radially inwards, horizontally). The force of gravity and the normal force cancel each other out. The net force is the tension, which provides the centripetal force required for circular motion.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the torques acting on the system.\nWe need to calculate the net external torque on the bob about the vertical axis passing through the hole. Let us denote this axis as the z-axis. The torque $\\vec{\\tau}$ about this axis is given by the z-component of $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$, where $\\vec{r}$ is the position vector from the axis to the bob and $\\vec{F}$ is the net external force.\nThe tension force $\\vec{T}$ is directed radially inward, pointing towards the center of the circle (the hole). The position vector $\\vec{r}$ points from the center to the bob. Thus, $\\vec{T}$ and $\\vec{r}$ are anti-parallel. The cross product $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{T}$ is zero. Therefore, the tension in the string exerts no torque on the bob about the axis of rotation.\nThe problem statement explicitly mentions that the process of pulling the string exerts no net torque on the bob about the axis passing through the hole.\nSince the net external torque about the vertical axis of rotation is zero ($\\tau_z = 0$), the angular momentum of the bob about this axis must be conserved.\n\nStep 3: Apply the conservation of angular momentum.\nThe angular momentum $L_z$ of a point mass $m$ moving in a circle of radius $r$ with angular velocity $\\omega$ is given by $L_z = I_z \\omega$, where $I_z$ is the moment of inertia about the axis of rotation. For a point mass, $I_z = mr^2$.\nSo, the angular momentum is $L_z = mr^2\\omega$.\nAccording to the principle of conservation of angular momentum, the initial angular momentum $L_{z,1}$ must be equal to the final angular momentum $L_{z,2}$.\n$$L_{z,1} = L_{z,2}$$\n\nStep 4: Formulate the conservation equation in terms of the given variables.\nThe initial angular momentum is:\n$$L_{z,1} = m r_1^2 \\omega_1$$\nThe final angular momentum is:\n$$L_{z,2} = m r_2^2 \\omega_2$$\nSetting them equal to each other:\n$$m r_1^2 \\omega_1 = m r_2^2 \\omega_2$$\n\nStep 5: Solve for the final angular velocity $\\omega_2$.\nWe can cancel the mass $m$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$r_1^2 \\omega_1 = r_2^2 \\omega_2$$\nSolving for $\\omega_2$, we get:\n$$\\omega_2 = \\omega_1 \\left( \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\right)^2$$\n\nStep 6: Substitute the given relationship between the initial and final radii.\nThe problem states that the final radius is $r_2 = \\frac{1}{3} r_1$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\omega_2$:\n$$\\omega_2 = \\omega_1 \\left( \\frac{r_1}{\\frac{1}{3}r_1} \\right)^2$$\nThe term $r_1$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n$$\\omega_2 = \\omega_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{3}} \\right)^2 = \\omega_1 (3)^2$$\n$$\\omega_2 = 9 \\omega_1$$\nTherefore, the new angular velocity is 9 times the initial angular velocity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9\\omega_1}$$", "id": "2219584"}]}
