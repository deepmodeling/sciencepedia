A second block of mass $m_2$ is attached to the bottom of the first block by a light, inextensible string. Initially, the system is held stationary by an external agent such that the string is taut and the spring is at its natural, un-stretched length. The system is then released from rest. Let $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity. Determine the maximum tension that the string will experience during the subsequent motion.", "solution": "Let's define a vertical coordinate system with the origin $y=0$ at the initial position of block $m_1$ (where the spring is un-stretched), and the positive direction as downwards.\n\nWhen the system is released from rest, both blocks are connected by a taut string and will move together as a single entity. The total mass of this composite system is $M = m_1 + m_2$. The system is subject to two forces: the downward force of gravity, $Mg = (m_1 + m_2)g$, and the upward restoring force from the spring, $F_s = -ky$. The equation of motion for the center of mass of the system is given by Newton's second law:\n$$M a = Mg - ky$$\n$$a = g - \\frac{k}{M}y$$\nThis is the equation for simple harmonic motion (SHM). We can find the equilibrium position, $y_{eq}$, by setting the net force (and thus acceleration) to zero:\n$$Mg - ky_{eq} = 0$$\n$$y_{eq} = \\frac{Mg}{k} = \\frac{(m_1 + m_2)g}{k}$$\nThe system will oscillate about this equilibrium position. The motion can be described as SHM with an angular frequency $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{M}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m_1 + m_2}}$.\n\nThe system is released from rest at $y=0$. The amplitude of the oscillation, $A$, is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position. Since the system starts from rest at $y=0$, the amplitude is the distance from the starting point to the equilibrium point:\n$$A = |y_{eq} - 0| = y_{eq} = \\frac{(m_1 + m_2)g}{k}$$\nThe lowest point of the oscillation will be at a displacement $y_{max}$ which is one amplitude below the equilibrium position:\n$$y_{max} = y_{eq} + A = y_{eq} + y_{eq} = 2y_{eq} = \\frac{2(m_1 + m_2)g}{k}$$\n\nNow, we need to find the tension $T$ in the string. We can do this by applying Newton's second law to the lower block, $m_2$. The forces acting on $m_2$ are gravity $m_2g$ (downwards) and the tension $T$ (upwards).\n$$m_2 a = m_2 g - T$$\n$$T = m_2 g - m_2 a = m_2(g-a)$$\nTo find the maximum tension $T_{max}$, we need to find the condition that maximizes this expression. This occurs when the acceleration $a$ is at its minimum value (i.e., its largest negative value, corresponding to the maximum upward acceleration).\n\nThe acceleration in SHM is greatest in magnitude at the extreme points of the motion. The acceleration of the system at any position $y$ is given by $a = -\\omega^2(y-y_{eq})$. The acceleration will be minimized (most negative) when the displacement $y$ is maximized, i.e., at the lowest point of the motion, $y = y_{max}$.\nLet's calculate the acceleration at this point, $a_{min}$:\n$$a_{min} = -\\omega^2(y_{max} - y_{eq})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\omega^2$, $y_{max}$, and $y_{eq}$:\n$$a_{min} = -\\frac{k}{m_1 + m_2} \\left( \\frac{2(m_1 + m_2)g}{k} - \\frac{(m_1 + m_2)g}{k} \\right)$$\n$$a_{min} = -\\frac{k}{m_1 + m_2} \\left( \\frac{(m_1 + m_2)g}{k} \\right)$$\n$$a_{min} = -g$$\nThis means that at the lowest point of its trajectory, the system has an upward acceleration of magnitude $g$.\n\nFinally, we can find the maximum tension by substituting this minimum acceleration into the equation for tension:\n$$T_{max} = m_2(g - a_{min})$$\n$$T_{max} = m_2(g - (-g))$$\n$$T_{max} = m_2(2g) = 2m_2g$$\nThus, the maximum tension in the string is $2m_2g$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2m_{2}g}$$", "id": "2216446"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem expands the concept of connected systems to a rigid body where translational and rotational motions are coupled.
