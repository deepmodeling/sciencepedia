By applying Newton's second law on an inclined plane, you will practice dissecting forces into components and connect them to the equations of motion, a core skill in physics and engineering analysis [@problem_id:2198686].", "problem": "An automotive safety engineer is tasked with reconstructing the events of a traffic incident. A car of mass $m$ was traveling up a long, straight road with a constant inclination angle $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. The driver suddenly applied the brakes, causing all four wheels to lock and skid. The car came to a complete stop after leaving skid marks of a uniform length $L$. The initial speed of the car at the moment the brakes were applied was $v_0$. Assuming the only forces acting on the car parallel to the road surface during the skid are friction and a component of gravity, derive an expression for the coefficient of kinetic friction, $\\mu_k$, between the tires and the road surface. Your expression should be in terms of $v_0$, $L$, $\\theta$, and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.", "solution": "Choose the positive axis along the incline, pointing uphill.

This exercise provides a powerful illustration of this principle through the lens of the work-energy theorem. By analyzing a system that loses energy as it slides across a rough patch, you will learn to quantify the non-conservative work done by friction and see its direct impact on the system's total mechanical energy [@problem_id:2198693].", "problem": "In a quality control laboratory, a new low-friction surface coating is being tested. A small block of mass $m$ is released from rest at a height $h$ at the top of a frictionless circular track. The track smoothly transitions into a short, horizontal test strip of length $L$ coated with the material being tested. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and this strip is $\\mu_k$. After crossing the strip, the block moves onto a second frictionless circular track and rises on the opposite side.

The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "We will solve this problem using the work-energy theorem. The theorem states that the work done by all non-conservative forces, $W_{nc}$, is equal to the change in the total mechanical energy of the system, $\\Delta E_{mech}$. The mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy ($K$) and potential energy ($U$).\n$$W_{nc} = \\Delta E_{mech} = E_{final} - E_{initial}$$\n\nFirst, let's define the initial and final states of the block. We will set the gravitational potential energy to be zero ($U=0$) at the level of the horizontal test strip.\n\nThe initial state is when the block is released from rest at a height $h$.\nThe initial kinetic energy is $K_{initial} = 0$, since the block starts from rest.\nThe initial potential energy is $U_{initial} = mgh$.\nTherefore, the total initial mechanical energy is $E_{initial} = K_{initial} + U_{initial} = 0 + mgh = mgh$.\n\nThe final state is when the block reaches its maximum height $h'$ on the other side of the swing. At this maximum height, the block momentarily comes to rest.\nThe final kinetic energy is $K_{final} = 0$.\nThe final potential energy is $U_{final} = mgh'$.\nTherefore, the total final mechanical energy is $E_{final} = K_{final} + U_{final} = 0 + mgh' = mgh'$.\n\nNext, we identify the non-conservative forces and calculate the work they do. The forces acting on the block are gravity (conservative), the normal force from the track (does no work as it's always perpendicular to the velocity), and friction (non-conservative). The only non-conservative force that performs work is the kinetic friction as the block slides across the test strip.\n\nThe work is done over the length of the strip, $L$. The force of kinetic friction, $f_k$, is given by $f_k = \\mu_k N$, where $N$ is the normal force. As the block moves along the horizontal strip, the normal force from the strip balances the gravitational force on the block. Thus, $N = mg$.\nThe friction force is then $f_k = \\mu_k mg$.\n\nWork is defined as $W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{d}$. The friction force opposes the direction of motion, so the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector is $180^\\circ$.\nThe work done by friction is $W_{friction} = f_k \\cdot L \\cdot \\cos(180^\\circ) = -f_k L$.\nSubstituting the expression for $f_k$, we get:\n$W_{nc} = W_{friction} = -\\mu_k mg L$.\n\nNow we can substitute the expressions for $E_{initial}$, $E_{final}$, and $W_{nc}$ into the work-energy theorem:\n$$W_{nc} = E_{final} - E_{initial}$$\n$$-\\mu_k mg L = mgh' - mgh$$\n\nTo find the final height $h'$, we solve this equation. We can divide the entire equation by $mg$ (since $m \\neq 0$ and $g \\neq 0$):\n$$-\\mu_k L = h' - h$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $h'$:\n$$h' = h - \\mu_k L$$\nThis is the maximum height the block reaches on the other side.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{h - \\mu_k L}$$", "id": "2198693"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem introduces a dynamic system where the forces involved are not constant but change as the system's configuration evolves.
