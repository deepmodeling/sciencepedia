By analyzing two masses on separate frictionless inclines, you will use Newton's First Law, $\\sum \\vec{F} = 0$, to derive a relationship between the masses that depends solely on the system's geometry. This practice illustrates how equilibrium conditions can elegantly reveal the essential constraints within a mechanical system, independent of other parameters like the specific properties of the connecting spring.

The first plane, on which $m_1$ rests, makes an angle $\\theta_1$ with the horizontal. The second plane, on which $m_2$ rests, makes an angle $\\theta_2$ with the horizontal. The particles are connected by a single light spring with a spring constant $k$ and a natural (unstretched) length of $L_0$. The system is allowed to settle into static equilibrium, with the spring aligned along the surfaces of the inclines.\n\nFind an expression for the ratio of the masses, $\\frac{m_2}{m_1}$, required for this equilibrium configuration. Express your answer in terms of $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$.", "solution": "Let the two smooth planes meet at a common lowest point. Choose the positive direction along each plane to be uphill (away from the joint). On each mass, the only forces with components along the plane are the component of gravity and the spring force. Because the planes are smooth, there is no friction, and the normal forces are perpendicular to the planes, contributing no along-plane components.\n\nLet $F$ denote the magnitude of the spring force at each end. For a light (massless) spring in static equilibrium, the internal force is uniform along its length, so both masses experience the same magnitude $F$. Since gravity pulls each mass downhill with component $m_{i} g \\sin \\theta_{i}$, equilibrium requires that the spring push each mass uphill; this corresponds to the spring being in compression, which is consistent with Hooke's law $F = k|L_{0} - L|$, though the explicit value of $F$ will cancel in the ratio.\n\nWriting force balance along each plane:\n$$\nF - m_{1} g \\sin \\theta_{1} = 0, \\qquad F - m_{2} g \\sin \\theta_{2} = 0.\n$$\nEliminating $F$ gives\n$$\nm_{1} g \\sin \\theta_{1} = m_{2} g \\sin \\theta_{2}.\n$$\nSolving for the ratio,\n$$\n\\frac{m_{2}}{m_{1}} = \\frac{\\sin \\theta_{1}}{\\sin \\theta_{2}}.\n$$\nThis condition is necessary and sufficient for static equilibrium; the spring constant $k$ and natural length $L_{0}$ determine only the actual compression and positions along the planes, not the required mass ratio.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\sin\\theta_{1}}{\\sin\\theta_{2}}}$$", "id": "2190300"}, {"introduction": "Moving from one-dimensional analysis to equilibrium in a plane, this problem focuses on the vector nature of forces and the role of static friction.
