This first exercise provides a quintessential scenario to practice this core skill, involving an object on an inclined plane subject to gravity, tension, and friction. By determining the range of masses for which the system remains at rest, you will explore the nature of static friction and learn to analyze the boundary conditions that define the limits of equilibrium [@problem_id:2218273].", "problem": "A block of mass $m_1$ rests on a rough inclined plane which makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal. The coefficient of static friction between the block and the plane is $\\mu_s$. A light, inextensible cord is attached to the block, passes over a frictionless, massless pulley at the top of the incline, and is connected to a second block of mass $m_2$ that hangs vertically. The entire system is in static equilibrium. It is known that the angle of inclination $\\theta$ is large enough that if the cord were to be cut, the block of mass $m_1$ would slide down the plane.\n\nBecause of static friction, there is a range of possible values for the mass $m_2$ for which the system can remain in equilibrium. Determine the minimum possible value, $m_{2,\\text{min}}$, and the maximum possible value, $m_{2,\\text{max}}$, for the mass $m_2$.

The cord is light and the pulley is frictionless and massless, so the tension $T$ is uniform. Since the system is in static equilibrium, we can apply force balance. For the hanging mass $m_2$, force balance gives $m_2 g - T = 0$, hence $T = m_2 g$. The normal force on $m_1$ is $N = m_1 g \\cos\\theta$.\n\nThe static friction force $f_s$ on $m_1$ is a component along the incline that opposes the tendency of motion. Its magnitude is limited by $|f_s| \\le \\mu_s N$. The sum of forces along the incline on $m_1$ must be zero:\n$$ T + f_s - m_1 g \\sin\\theta = 0 $$\nThere is a range of values for $m_2$ (and thus $T$) for which this condition can be met, determined by the two limiting cases where friction is at its maximum.\n\n1) Minimum $m_2$ (impending motion of $m_1$ down the plane): If $m_2$ is too small, $m_1$ tends to slide down the incline, so the static friction force $f_s$ acts up the plane.

This ensures that $m_{2,\\text{min}}$ is positive.\n\n2) Maximum $m_2$ (impending motion of $m_1$ up the plane): If $m_2$ is too large, $m_1$ tends to be pulled up the incline, so the static friction force $f_s$ acts down the plane.
