The cart starts its journey at the apex of the dome (the highest point) and is given a certain initial horizontal velocity $v_0$. As the cart travels down the dome, it will eventually lose contact with the surface and become a projectile.\n\nAssuming the cart can be treated as a point mass, find a symbolic expression for the angle $\\theta$, measured in radians from the vertical line passing through the center of the dome, at which the cart loses contact with the surface. Your expression should be in terms of $v_0$, $R$, and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.", "solution": "The solution to this problem involves applying the principle of conservation of mechanical energy and Newton's second law for circular motion.\n\nFirst, we establish a coordinate system and a reference for potential energy. Let the center of the spherical dome be the origin $(0,0)$. We define the gravitational potential energy to be zero at the height of the center, so that a height $h$ corresponds to a potential energy of $U = mgh$. The apex of the dome is at a height of $R$.\n\nThe cart starts at the apex ($\\theta = 0$) with an initial velocity $v_0$. At this point, its height is $R$. The initial mechanical energy $E_i$ is the sum of its initial kinetic energy $K_i$ and initial potential energy $U_i$.\n$$E_i = K_i + U_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_{0}^{2} + mgR$$\n\nAs the cart slides down to a point described by the angle $\\theta$ from the vertical, its height above the center is $h(\\theta) = R\\cos\\theta$. Let its speed at this point be $v$. The mechanical energy $E_f$ at this point is the sum of its kinetic energy $K_f$ and potential energy $U_f$.\n$$E_f = K_f + U_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} + mg(R\\cos\\theta)$$\n\nSince the dome is stipulated to be frictionless, there are no non-conservative forces doing work on the cart. Therefore, mechanical energy is conserved, i.e., $E_i = E_f$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}mv_{0}^{2} + mgR = \\frac{1}{2}mv^{2} + mgR\\cos\\theta $$\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by $m$ and multiplying by 2:\n$$ v_{0}^{2} + 2gR = v^{2} + 2gR\\cos\\theta $$\nSolving for $v^2$, we get an expression for the square of the cart's speed at any angle $\\theta$ while it is on the dome:\n$$ v^{2} = v_{0}^{2} + 2gR(1 - \\cos\\theta) $$\n\nNext, we analyze the forces acting on the cart to determine when it loses contact with the surface. The forces are the gravitational force $\\vec{W}$ (acting vertically downwards with magnitude $mg$) and the normal force $\\vec{N}$ (acting radially outwards, perpendicular to the surface). The cart is undergoing circular motion of radius $R$. We consider the forces along the radial direction, with the positive direction pointing towards the center of the dome.\n\nThe component of the gravitational force in the radial direction is $mg\\cos\\theta$. The normal force $N$ points in the negative radial direction. The net radial force provides the centripetal force, $F_c = \\frac{mv^{2}}{R}$.\nApplying Newton's second law in the radial direction:\n$$ \\sum F_{radial} = mg\\cos\\theta - N = \\frac{mv^{2}}{R} $$\n\nThe cart loses contact with the dome at the exact moment the normal force $N$ becomes zero. At this point, the surface is no longer pushing on the cart.

We can equate them to solve for the angle $\\theta$.\n$$ v_{0}^{2} + 2gR(1 - \\cos\\theta) = gR\\cos\\theta $$\nNow, we solve for $\\cos\\theta$.\n$$ v_{0}^{2} + 2gR - 2gR\\cos\\theta = gR\\cos\\theta $$\n$$ v_{0}^{2} + 2gR = 3gR\\cos\\theta $$\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{v_{0}^{2} + 2gR}{3gR} $$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{3gR} + \\frac{2}{3} $$\nThe problem asks for the angle $\\theta$ itself. To find $\\theta$, we take the arccosine of this expression.\n$$ \\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{3gR} + \\frac{2}{3}\\right) $$\nThis expression is valid as long as the argument of the arccosine is between -1 and 1.
