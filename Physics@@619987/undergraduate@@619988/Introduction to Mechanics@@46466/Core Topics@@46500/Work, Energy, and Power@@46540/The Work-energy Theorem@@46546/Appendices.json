By analyzing the work done on a suitcase inside an accelerating train [@problem_id:2091537], you will solidify your understanding of how force and displacement combine to change an object's energy of motion, regardless of the observer's own movement.", "problem": "A passenger is traveling on a high-speed Magnetic Levitation (maglev) train that moves along a perfectly straight and horizontal track. The passenger holds a suitcase of mass $m$ completely stationary with respect to their own body, maintaining it at a constant height above the train's floor. The train, initially at rest, accelerates uniformly until it reaches a final cruising speed of $v_f$.\n\nDetermine the total work done *by the passenger* on the suitcase during this entire acceleration phase. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of the mass $m$ and the final speed $v_f$.", "solution": "Work is frame-dependent but simplest to compute in an inertial frame fixed to the ground. The suitcase starts from rest and ends with speed $v_{f}$, moving purely horizontally at constant height. Thus the gravitational force does no work because the vertical displacement is zero, and the vertical component of the passenger’s force also does no work for the same reason.\n\nLet $\\hat{x}$ be along the track and denote the passenger’s horizontal force by $F_{x}(t)$. With no other horizontal forces acting on the suitcase, Newton’s second law gives\n$$\nF_{x}(t)=m a(t)=m \\frac{d v}{d t}.\n$$\nThe infinitesimal work done by the passenger on the suitcase is\n$$\ndW_{p}=\\vec{F}_{p}\\cdot d\\vec{r}=F_{x}\\,dx=F_{x}\\,v\\,dt.\n$$\nSubstituting $F_{x}=m\\,dv/dt$ yields\n$$\ndW_{p}=m \\frac{d v}{d t} v\\,dt=m v\\,dv.\n$$\nIntegrating from the initial speed $v=0$ to the final speed $v=v_{f}$,\n$$\nW_{p}=\\int_{0}^{v_{f}} m v\\,dv=\\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}.\n$$\nTherefore, the total work done by the passenger on the suitcase over the acceleration phase equals the increase in the suitcase’s kinetic energy and is independent of the acceleration history.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} m v_{f}^{2}}$$", "id": "2091537"}, {"introduction": "The true power of the Work-Energy Theorem shines when dealing with non-conservative forces like friction and air resistance. This practice provides a classic example of how to quantify the energy dissipated by such forces without needing to know the details of the force itself during the motion. By examining a probe's vertical flight affected by air resistance [@problem_id:2091578], you'll learn to isolate the work done by a non-conservative force by simply accounting for the change in the system's total mechanical energy, a widely applicable and powerful problem-solving technique.", "problem": "A small meteorological probe of mass $m$ is launched vertically upwards from the ground with an initial speed $v_i$.
