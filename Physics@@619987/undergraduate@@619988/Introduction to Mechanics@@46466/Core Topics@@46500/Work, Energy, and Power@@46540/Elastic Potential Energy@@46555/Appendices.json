The composite is formed into a cylinder which stands vertically on a heavy, stable lab bench. For the relevant range of forces, the composite cylinder can be modeled as an ideal spring with a spring constant $k$. The experiment involves a small, dense puck of mass $m$. The height of the puck itself is considered negligible. Let $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity. Two distinct procedures are performed to measure the compression of the composite cylinder.\n\nIn the first procedure, the puck is gently placed on top of the uncompressed cylinder and slowly lowered, with external support, until the system reaches static equilibrium. At this point, the external support is removed, and the compression distance of the cylinder is measured to be $d_1$.\n\nIn the second procedure, the setup is reset. The puck is held so that its bottom face is just touching the top of the uncompressed cylinder. It is then released from rest. The maximum compression distance achieved by the cylinder during the subsequent motion is measured to be $d_2$.\n\nCalculate the value of the ratio $\\frac{d_2}{d_1}$.", "solution": "Let downward displacement of the cylinder’s top (and spring compression) be denoted by $x$.
