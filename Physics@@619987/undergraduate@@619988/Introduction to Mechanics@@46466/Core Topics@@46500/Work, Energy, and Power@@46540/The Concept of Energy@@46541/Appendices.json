This practice problem focuses on the fundamental definition of work as the dot product of force and displacement vectors, represented mathematically as $W = \\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r}$. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario where the applied force is perpendicular to a segment of the motion, you will sharpen your understanding that only the component of force parallel to the displacement contributes to the work done, a crucial and often misunderstood distinction in physics.

This exercise demonstrates that an object's final speed depends only on its initial speed and change in height, not on the initial direction of its velocity.
