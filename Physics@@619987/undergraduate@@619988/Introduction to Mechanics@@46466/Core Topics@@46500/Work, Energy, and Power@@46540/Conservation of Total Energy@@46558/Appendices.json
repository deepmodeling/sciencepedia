This first practice problem is a classic exercise in synthesizing concepts. While the principle of conservation of mechanical energy allows us to relate an object's speed to its height, it alone cannot tell us the precise moment it loses contact with a curved surface. To solve this, you must also apply Newton's second law for circular motion, providing a complete picture of the dynamics. [@problem_id:2185319]", "problem": "A tiny water droplet of mass $m$ is positioned at the exact apex of a large, solid sphere of radius $R$. The sphere's surface is perfectly smooth, making friction negligible. An external mechanism imparts a small initial horizontal speed $v_0$ to the droplet, causing it to slide down the surface of the sphere. As the droplet gains speed, it eventually loses contact with the sphere and becomes a projectile. Determine the specific initial speed $v_0$ that will cause the droplet to lose contact with the sphere at the exact moment its vertical displacement from the apex is $h = \\frac{R}{9}$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $R$ and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.", "solution": "Let's establish a coordinate system and define our variables. Let the origin be at the center of the sphere. The position of the droplet can be described by an angle $\\phi$ measured from the apex (top vertical position, $\\phi=0$). The bottom of the sphere would be at $\\phi=\\pi$. The radius of the sphere is $R$.\n\nStep 1: Relate the vertical displacement $h$ to the angle $\\phi$.\nThe vertical position of the droplet, measured from the center of the sphere, is $y = R\\cos\\phi$. The apex is at $y_{apex} = R\\cos(0) = R$. The vertical displacement from the apex is $h = y_{apex} - y = R - R\\cos\\phi = R(1-\\cos\\phi)$.\nThe problem states that the droplet loses contact at a height $h = \\frac{R}{9}$.

Let's apply Newton's second law in the radial direction. The net radial force provides the centripetal acceleration, $a_r = \\frac{v_d^2}{R}$, directed towards the center of the sphere. Let's define the inward radial direction as positive.\n\nThe component of gravity in the inward radial direction is $mg\\cos\\phi_d$. The normal force acts radially outward, so its component in the inward direction is $-N$.\nThe equation for the net radial force is:\n$$\\sum F_r = mg\\cos\\phi_d - N = ma_r = \\frac{mv_d^2}{R}$$\nThe droplet loses contact with the sphere when the normal force $N$ becomes zero. At the moment of detachment, $N=0$.\n$$mg\\cos\\phi_d - 0 = \\frac{mv_d^2}{R}$$\n$$v_d^2 = gR\\cos\\phi_d$$\n\nStep 4: Combine the results from energy and force analysis.\nWe have two expressions for the square of the speed at detachment, $v_d^2$:\n1. From energy: $v_d^2 = v_0^2 + 2gR(1-\\cos\\phi_d)$\n2. From forces: $v_d^2 = gR\\cos\\phi_d$\n\nEquating these two expressions allows us to solve for the initial speed $v_0$:\n$$v_0^2 + 2gR(1-\\cos\\phi_d) = gR\\cos\\phi_d$$\n$$v_0^2 = gR\\cos\\phi_d - 2gR(1-\\cos\\phi_d)$$\n$$v_0^2 = gR\\cos\\phi_d - 2gR + 2gR\\cos\\phi_d$$\n$$v_0^2 = 3gR\\cos\\phi_d - 2gR$$\n\nStep 5: Substitute the value of $\\cos\\phi_d$ and find the final answer.\nFrom Step 1, we found that $\\cos\\phi_d = \\frac{8}{9}$ for the given detachment height.\n$$v_0^2 = 3gR\\left(\\frac{8}{9}\\right) - 2gR$$\n$$v_0^2 = \\frac{8}{3}gR - 2gR$$\n$$v_0^2 = \\left(\\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{6}{3}\\right)gR$$\n$$v_0^2 = \\frac{2}{3}gR$$\nTaking the square root gives the initial speed:\n$$v_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2gR}{3}}}$$", "id": "2185319"}, {"introduction": "In our universe, perpetual motion is impossible due to dissipative forces like friction, which convert mechanical energy into other forms.
