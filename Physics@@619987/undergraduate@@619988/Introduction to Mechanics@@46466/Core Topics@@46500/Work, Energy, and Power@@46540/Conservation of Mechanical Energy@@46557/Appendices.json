The incline makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal, and the initial vertical height of the block above the base of the incline is $h$. The incline merges seamlessly with a frictionless horizontal track. A light, horizontal spring with a spring constant $k$ is fixed to a rigid wall at one end. The other end of the spring is free and is located at the point where the incline meets the horizontal track. Let this point define the origin of a coordinate system, $x=0$. The block slides down the incline, moves along the horizontal track, and collides with the free end of the spring. The collision is instantaneous, and the block becomes permanently attached to the spring. Subsequently, the block-spring system undergoes simple harmonic motion.\n\nDerive an expression for the amplitude of this simple harmonic motion in terms of $m$, $g$, $h$, and $k$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "The block starts from rest at vertical height $h$ above the base, so its initial mechanical energy is purely gravitational potential:\n$$\nE_{\\text{top}}=m g h.\n$$\nThe incline and track are frictionless, so mechanical energy is conserved during the slide.
