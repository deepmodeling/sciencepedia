These lattices are formed by the interference of laser beams, which creates a spatially periodic potential energy landscape. Consider a simplified one-dimensional model where a single atom of mass $m$ is constrained to move along the x-axis. The potential energy of the atom in this lattice is described by the function $U(x) = U_0 \\cos(kx)$, where $U_0$ is a positive constant representing the potential depth in Joules, and $k$ is a positive constant related to the laser wavelength, with units of inverse meters.\n\nDetermine a general expression for all positions $x$ where the magnitude of the force acting on the atom is a maximum.

In one dimension, this simplifies to:\n$$F(x) = -\\frac{dU(x)}{dx}$$\nWe are given the potential energy function $U(x) = U_0 \\cos(kx)$. To find the force, we must take the derivative of this function with respect to $x$.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative $\\frac{dU}{dx}$:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( U_0 \\cos(kx) \\right) $$\nUsing the chain rule, where the derivative of $\\cos(u)$ is $-\\sin(u) \\frac{du}{dx}$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dx} = U_0 \\left( -\\sin(kx) \\cdot \\frac{d(kx)}{dx} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dx} = U_0 (-\\sin(kx) \\cdot k) = -kU_0 \\sin(kx) $$\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the force equation:\n$$ F(x) = -(-kU_0 \\sin(kx)) $$\n$$ F(x) = kU_0 \\sin(kx) $$\nThe problem asks for the positions where the magnitude of the force, $|F(x)|$, is a maximum. The magnitude of the force is:\n$$ |F(x)| = |kU_0 \\sin(kx)| $$\nSince $U_0$ and $k$ are defined as positive constants, we can write:\n$$ |F(x)| = kU_0 |\\sin(kx)| $$\nTo maximize the magnitude of the force, $|F(x)|$, we need to maximize the term $|\\sin(kx)|$. The sine function, $\\sin(\\theta)$, oscillates between -1 and 1. Therefore, its absolute value, $|\\sin(\\theta)|$, has a maximum value of 1.\n\nThe magnitude of the force is maximized when $|\\sin(kx)| = 1$. This condition is met when $\\sin(kx) = 1$ or $\\sin(kx) = -1$.\nThis occurs when the argument of the sine function, $kx$, is an odd-integer multiple of $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.

The curved surface of the hemisphere is in contact with the top of the fixed sphere, and the surfaces are sufficiently rough to prevent any slipping during motion. For this problem, you may use the fact that the center of mass of a uniform solid hemisphere of radius $r$ is located at a distance of $3r/8$ from the center of its flat circular base, along its axis of symmetry.\n\nInitially, the hemisphere is balanced in equilibrium with its axis of symmetry aligned with the vertical line passing through the center of the fixed sphere.
