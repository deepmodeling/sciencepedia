For small displacements, the potential well created by the trap is approximately parabolic, leading to a linear restoring force (Hooke's Law). However, for larger displacements, non-linear effects become significant.\n\nConsider a model where a dielectric bead is trapped by an optical tweezer. The potential energy, $U(x)$, of the bead as a function of its one-dimensional displacement, $x$, from the center of the trap is given by the expression:\n$$U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \\frac{1}{4}bx^4$$\nwhere $k$ and $b$ are positive constants that characterize the optical trap.\n\nAn experimenter then applies an additional constant external force, $F_{ext}$, along the positive $x$-axis (for instance, by creating a gentle fluid flow). This causes the bead to settle at a new stable equilibrium position, $x_{eq}$, displaced from the center of the trap.\n\nDerive an expression for the magnitude of the external force, $F_{ext}$, in terms of the constants $k$, $b$, and the new equilibrium position $x_{eq}$.", "solution": "The optical trap is conservative with potential energy $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2} k x^{2} + \\frac{1}{4} b x^{4}$.

Since the potential $U(\\rho)$ in this problem depends only on the radial coordinate $\\rho$ and is independent of the angular coordinate, it describes a central force field. The force vector will be purely radial.\n\nIn two-dimensional polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi)$, the gradient of a scalar function $U$ is given by $\\nabla U = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\rho}\\hat{\\rho} + \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\phi}\\hat{\\phi}$.\nBecause $U$ is a function of $\\rho$ only, the term $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\phi}$ is zero.

A stable equilibrium occurs at a local minimum of the potential energy, while an unstable equilibrium occurs at a local maximum.
