The force exerted by the tweezer on the bead along a one-dimensional path (the x-axis) is a combination of two effects: a primary trapping force, which acts like a Hooke's law spring pulling the bead towards the center of the trap at $x=0$, and a secondary force arising from an interference pattern in the laser light.\n\nThe primary trapping force is given by $F_{trap}(x) = -\\alpha x$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the stiffness of the trap. The secondary force from the interference pattern is described by $F_{pattern}(x) = F_0 \\cos(kx)$, where $F_0$ is the maximum amplitude of this force and $k$ is a constant related to the wavelength of the laser light. The total force exerted on the bead by the tweezer is the sum of these two forces, $F(x) = F_{pattern}(x) + F_{trap}(x)$.\n\nAn external actuator slowly moves the bead from the center of the trap at $x_i = 0$ to a final position $x_f = L$.
