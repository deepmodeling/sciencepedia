While static friction is essential for a wheel to roll and accelerate, does it deliver power to the wheel? This problem requires a careful application of the power definition, forcing us to distinguish between the velocity of an object's center of mass and the velocity of the point where the force is applied, providing a deeper insight into the energetics of rolling without slipping [@problem_id:2209528].", "problem": "A prototype for a planetary rover is being tested on a horizontal surface. The rover's propulsion system consists of a single powered wheel, which can be modeled as a uniform solid cylinder of mass $M$ and radius $R$. An internal motor applies a constant torque $\\tau_m$ to the axle of this wheel. During operation, the wheel rolls without slipping. The rover experiences a total resistive force from its surroundings (including air drag and unpowered wheel friction) that is directly proportional to its speed, given by the expression $F_{res} = \\beta v_{cm}$, where $v_{cm}$ is the instantaneous speed of the rover's center of mass and $\\beta$ is a known positive constant. Determine the instantaneous power $P_f$ delivered by the force of static friction to the wheel, and the instantaneous power $P_m$ delivered by the motor to the wheel, at an instant when the rover's speed is $v_{cm}$.
