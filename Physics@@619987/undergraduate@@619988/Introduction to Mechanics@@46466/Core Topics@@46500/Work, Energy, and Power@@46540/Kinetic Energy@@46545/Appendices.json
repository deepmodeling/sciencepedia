Therefore, the total momentum of the fragments after the explosion must also be zero.\n$$ \\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3 = \\vec{0} $$\n\nThe total kinetic energy of the fragments, which is given as $K_{tot}$, is the sum of the kinetic energies of the individual fragments:\n$$ K_{tot} = K_1 + K_2 + K_3 $$\nwhere $K_i = \\frac{p_i^2}{2m_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the kinetic energy of the first fragment, $K_1$. From the energy equation, we can write:\n$$ K_1 = K_{tot} - (K_2 + K_3) $$\nTo maximize $K_1$, we must minimize the sum of the kinetic energies of the other two fragments, $K_2 + K_3$, subject to the constraint imposed by the conservation of momentum.\n\nFrom the momentum conservation equation, we can express the sum of the momenta of fragments 2 and 3 in terms of the momentum of fragment 1:\n$$ \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3 = -\\vec{p}_1 $$\nLet $\\vec{P}_{23} = \\vec{p}_2 + \\vec{p}_3$.

The kinetic energy of their center of mass is given by:\n$$ K_{cm,23} = \\frac{|\\vec{P}_{23}|^2}{2(m_2+m_3)} $$\nThe kinetic energy relative to the center of mass, $K_{rel,23}$, is always non-negative ($K_{rel,23} \\ge 0$).

The minimum possible value for $K_{rel,23}$ is zero. This occurs when there is no motion of the fragments relative to their center of mass, which means both fragments move with the same velocity: $\\vec{v}_2 = \\vec{v}_3$. In this scenario, the two fragments fly off together as if they were a single composite particle of mass $(m_2+m_3)$.\n\nTheir minimum combined kinetic energy is therefore:\n$$ (K_2 + K_3)_{min} = K_{cm,23} = \\frac{|\\vec{P}_{23}|^2}{2(m_2+m_3)} $$\nSubstituting $|\\vec{P}_{23}| = p_1$, we get:\n$$ (K_2 + K_3)_{min} = \\frac{p_1^2}{2(m_2+m_3)} $$\nThis is the minimum possible kinetic energy for fragments 2 and 3 for a given $p_1$.\n\nNow, we substitute this minimum value back into the total energy equation to find the condition that yields the maximum $K_1$:\n$$ K_{tot} = K_{1,max} + (K_2 + K_3)_{min} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for kinetic energy in terms of momentum:\n$$ K_{tot} = \\frac{p_1^2}{2m_1} + \\frac{p_1^2}{2(m_2+m_3)} $$\nHere, $p_1$ is the momentum of the first fragment when its kinetic energy is maximized.

Let's solve the above equation for this term.\n$$ \\frac{p_1^2}{2m_1} = K_{tot} \\frac{m_2+m_3}{M} $$\nThus, the maximum kinetic energy of the first fragment is:\n$$ K_{1,max} = K_{tot} \\frac{m_2+m_3}{M} $$\nFinally, we can express the mass sum $m_2+m_3$ in terms of the total mass $M$ and $m_1$. Since $M=m_1+m_2+m_3$, we have $m_2+m_3 = M-m_1$.
