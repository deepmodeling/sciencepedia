This cord has a natural unstretched length of $L_0$. The cord functions as a \"bungee spring\": it remains slack and exerts no force if its length is less than or equal to $L_0$, but it behaves as an ideal spring with a spring constant $k$ when its length exceeds $L_0$. The object is released and allowed to settle into a stable equilibrium position. Let $g$ be the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nDetermine the stretch of the cord, defined as the extension beyond its natural length $L_0$, when the object is at its stable equilibrium position.", "solution": "Let the vertical downward direction be positive. Denote the total length of the cord when the object is at rest by $L$. The cord is slack and exerts no force if $L \\leq L_{0}$, and behaves as an ideal spring with tension $T = k(L - L_{0})$ if $L > L_{0}$. \n\nFor a static equilibrium, the net force on the mass must be zero. If $L \\leq L_{0}$, the cord exerts no force, so the only force is the weight $mg$ downward. This cannot yield equilibrium because there is no upward force to balance $mg$. Therefore, at equilibrium the cord must be stretched with $L > L_{0}$.\n\nIn the stretched regime, the spring tension acts upward with magnitude $k(L - L_{0})$. Taking downward as positive, the net force is\n$$\nF_{\\text{net}} = mg - k(L - L_{0}).\n$$\nStatic equilibrium requires $F_{\\text{net}} = 0$, hence\n$$\nmg - k(L - L_{0}) = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k(L - L_{0}) = mg.\n$$\nDefine the stretch (extension beyond the natural length) by $x \\equiv L - L_{0}$. Then the equilibrium condition gives\n$$\nk x = mg \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{m g}{k}.\n$$\n\nTo confirm stability, consider a small displacement $x = x_{\\text{eq}} + \\delta x$ with $x_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{m g}{k}$. The net force becomes\n$$\nF_{\\text{net}} = mg - k(x_{\\text{eq}} + \\delta x) = -k\\,\\delta x,\n$$\nwhich is restoring (opposes the displacement).

This follows from energy conservation $E = \\frac{1}{2} m \\dot{x}^{2} + U(x)$: if $U$ has a strict local minimum at $x_{0}$, then for sufficiently small energies above $U(x_{0})$ the motion is confined to a neighborhood of $x_{0}$; if $U$ fails to have a strict local minimum, there exist arbitrarily small displacements with $U(x) \\leq U(x_{0})$, allowing escape from any neighborhood.\n\nEvaluate the behavior of $U$ near $x=0$:\n$$\nU(x) - U(0) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2} k_{2} x^{2}  x0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} k_{1} x^{2}  x0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSufficiency: If $k_{1}  0$ and $k_{2}  0$, then for all sufficiently small $x \\neq 0$, $U(x) - U(0)  0$ on both sides, so $x=0$ is a strict local minimum of $U$. Hence the equilibrium is stable.\n\nNecessity:\n- If $k_{1}  0$ (similarly for $k_{2}  0$), then for $x0$ small, $U(x) - U(0) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{1} x^{2}  0$, so $x=0$ is not a local minimum; moreover, $F(x) = -k_{1} x  0$ for $x0$, pushing the particle further away, which is unstable.\n- If $k_{1} = 0$ (similarly for $k_{2} = 0$), then for $x0$, $U(x) = U(0)$ and $F(x) = 0$. Taking initial data $x(0)=0$, $\\dot{x}(0)=v_{0}  0$ arbitrarily small yields $x(t) = v_{0} t$ for all $t0$, which exits any fixed neighborhood in finite time. Thus $x=0$ is not Lyapunov stable.\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium at $x=0$ is stable if and only if both $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ are strictly positive. Among the options, this is exactly option C. Options A, D, and E allow cases with one or both negative; option B is stronger than necessary since equality is not required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2189542"}, {"introduction": "Real-world systems rarely move in just one dimension.
