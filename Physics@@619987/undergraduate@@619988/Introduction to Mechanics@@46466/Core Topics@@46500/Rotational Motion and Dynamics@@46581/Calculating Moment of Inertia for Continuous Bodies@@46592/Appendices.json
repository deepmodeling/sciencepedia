This foundational exercise is the first step in moving from discrete point masses to continuous mass distributions.", "problem": "A thin, rigid rod of total length $L$ is constructed by joining two sections of equal length, $L/2$, end-to-end. One section has a uniform linear mass density $\\lambda_1$, while the adjoining section has a uniform linear mass density $\\lambda_2$. The two sections are seamlessly bonded to form a single continuous rod.\n\nDetermine the moment of inertia, $I$, of this composite rod about an axis that is perpendicular to the rod and passes through its geometric center (midpoint). Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $L$, $\\lambda_1$, and $\\lambda_2$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will calculate the moment of inertia by integration. The general formula for the moment of inertia of a continuous body about an axis is given by the integral $I = \\int r^2 dm$, where $r$ is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the mass element $dm$.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system. We place the origin $x=0$ at the midpoint of the rod, which is also the location of the axis of rotation. The rod therefore extends from $x = -L/2$ to $x = +L/2$.\n\nThe rod is composed of two halves with different linear mass densities. Let's designate the left half of the rod, from $x = -L/2$ to $x = 0$, as the section with linear mass density $\\lambda_1$. The right half, from $x = 0$ to $x = +L/2$, will have the linear mass density $\\lambda_2$.\n\nFor a thin rod lying along the x-axis, a small element of mass $dm$ corresponding to a small length element $dx$ is given by $dm = \\lambda(x) dx$, where $\\lambda(x)$ is the linear mass density at position $x$. The distance of this mass element from the axis of rotation (the origin) is simply $r = |x|$, so $r^2 = x^2$.\n\nThe total moment of inertia is the integral over the entire length of the rod. Since the density function $\\lambda(x)$ is piecewise, we must split the integral into two parts corresponding to the two sections of the rod:\n$$I = \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} x^2 \\lambda(x) dx$$\nWe can write this as the sum of the moments of inertia of the two halves, $I_1$ and $I_2$:\n$$I = I_1 + I_2 = \\int_{-L/2}^{0} x^2 \\lambda_1 dx + \\int_{0}^{L/2} x^2 \\lambda_2 dx$$\n\nNow, we evaluate each integral separately. For the first integral (the left half):\n$$I_1 = \\int_{-L/2}^{0} x^2 \\lambda_1 dx$$\nSince $\\lambda_1$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the integral:\n$$I_1 = \\lambda_1 \\int_{-L/2}^{0} x^2 dx = \\lambda_1 \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{-L/2}^{0}$$\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$$I_1 = \\lambda_1 \\left( \\frac{0^3}{3} - \\frac{(-L/2)^3}{3} \\right) = \\lambda_1 \\left( 0 - \\frac{-L^3/8}{3} \\right) = \\lambda_1 \\left( \\frac{L^3}{24} \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda_1 L^3}{24}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the second integral (the right half):\n$$I_2 = \\int_{0}^{L/2} x^2 \\lambda_2 dx$$\nSimilarly, $\\lambda_2$ is a constant:\n$$I_2 = \\lambda_2 \\int_{0}^{L/2} x^2 dx = \\lambda_2 \\left[ \\frac{x^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{L/2}$$\nEvaluating this definite integral:\n$$I_2 = \\lambda_2 \\left( \\frac{(L/2)^3}{3} - \\frac{0^3}{3} \\right) = \\lambda_2 \\left( \\frac{L^3/8}{3} - 0 \\right) = \\lambda_2 \\left( \\frac{L^3}{24} \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda_2 L^3}{24}$$\n\nThe total moment of inertia of the composite rod is the sum of the moments of inertia of the two halves:\n$$I = I_1 + I_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_1 L^3}{24} + \\frac{\\lambda_2 L^3}{24}$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{L^3}{24}$, we get the final expression:\n$$I = \\frac{(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2)L^3}{24}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2)L^3}{24}}$$", "id": "2180436"}, {"introduction": "Next, we extend our analysis from one dimension to two by considering a flat plate, or lamina.
