Initially, the sphere has a uniform mass density, a total mass $M$, and a radius $R$. It is set to rotate about an axis passing through its center with a constant initial angular velocity $\\omega_0$. The sphere is then subjected to a uniform internal heating process, causing it to expand. The expansion is isotropic, and the sphere remains a solid sphere of uniform density throughout the process. The process stops when the sphere's radius has doubled to $2R$. The total mass $M$ of the sphere remains constant as no material is lost. Assume that the expansion occurs in the absence of any external torques.\n\nDetermine the total work done by the internal forces of the alloy during this expansion.

According to the Work-Energy Theorem, the net work done on a system is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. In this case, the system is the sphere, and the only forces doing work are the internal forces of the material as it expands. Therefore, the work done by the internal forces, $W_{\\text{internal}}$, is equal to the change in the rotational kinetic energy of the sphere, $\\Delta K_{\\text{rot}}$.\n\n$$W_{\\text{internal}} = \\Delta K_{\\text{rot}} = K_{\\text{final}} - K_{\\text{initial}}$$\n\nThe rotational kinetic energy of a body is given by $K_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity.\n\nFirst, let's define the initial state of the system.\nThe initial radius is $R_1 = R$.\nThe initial mass is $M_1 = M$.\nThe moment of inertia of a solid sphere about an axis through its center is $I = \\frac{2}{5}MR^2$.
