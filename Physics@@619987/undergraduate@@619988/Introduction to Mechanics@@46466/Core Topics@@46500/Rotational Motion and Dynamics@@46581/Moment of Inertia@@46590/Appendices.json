The parallel axis theorem states that the moment of inertia $I$ about any axis is equal to the moment of inertia $I_{\\text{cm}}$ about a parallel axis passing through the center of mass, plus the product of the total mass $M$ and the square of the perpendicular distance $d$ between the two axes.

For a sphere of radius $R$, the perpendicular distance from the center of mass to a tangent line on its surface is simply the radius, $R$.
