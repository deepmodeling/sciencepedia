It is observed that the spool rolls without slipping on the floor. There exists a specific angle of pull, $\\theta_0$, at which the force of static friction exerted by the floor on the spool is exactly zero, while the spool still accelerates.

You are tasked with determining the final speed of a spool after a sharp pull, which requires applying the angular impulse-momentum theorem [@problem_id:2212017]. This exercise is an excellent opportunity to employ more advanced problem-solving techniques, such as choosing a strategic pivot point to elegantly eliminate unknown forces from your equations.", "problem": "A spool, with mass $M$ and outer radius $R$, has a concentric inner axle of radius $r$. The spool rests on a rough horizontal surface. The coefficient of static friction between the spool and the surface is sufficiently large to ensure the spool rolls without slipping at all times. The moment of inertia of the spool about its central axis of symmetry is given by the expression $I = \\gamma M R^2$, where $\\gamma$ is a dimensionless constant characterizing the mass distribution. A light, inextensible string is wound around the inner axle. The string comes off the top of the axle, and a brief, sharp horizontal force is applied to its free end, away from the spool. This action delivers a total horizontal impulse of magnitude $J$ to the string.\n\nDetermine the final speed of the center of mass of the spool immediately after the impulse has been delivered. Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $M, R, r, \\gamma$, and $J$.", "solution": "Let the final speed of the center of mass (CM) of the spool be $v_{cm}$ and its final angular speed be $\\omega$. The impulse $J$ is applied horizontally to the right. We expect the spool to move to the right and rotate. The condition for rolling without slipping connects the linear and angular speeds.\n\nWe can solve this problem by applying the angular impulse-momentum theorem about the instantaneous point of contact, $P$, between the spool and the horizontal surface. This point is instantaneously at rest, so we can treat it as a fixed pivot point for the duration of the infinitesimal impulse. This approach is powerful because the torque due to the unknown friction force, which also acts at point $P$, is zero about this point, thus eliminating it from our equations.\n\n1.  **Identify External Torques:** The external horizontal forces acting on the spool are the force from the string, $F(t)$, and the friction force, $f(t)$. The impulse from the string is $J = \\int F(t) dt$. The impulse from friction is $J_f = \\int f(t) dt$. When calculating the angular impulse about point $P$, the lever arm for the friction force is zero. Therefore, the only external horizontal force that produces a torque about $P$ is the force from the string.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Angular Impulse:** The string comes off the top of the inner axle and is pulled horizontally. The center of the spool is at a height $R$ from the ground. The top of the inner axle is at a height $R+r$ from the ground. The force $F(t)$ is applied at this height. The lever arm for this force about the contact point $P$ is $d = R+r$. The torque produced by the string force about $P$ is $\\tau_P(t) = F(t) d = F(t)(R+r)$. The total angular impulse about $P$, denoted $\\mathcal{J}_{\\tau, P}$, is the time integral of this torque:\n$$\n\\mathcal{J}_{\\tau, P} = \\int \\tau_P(t) dt = \\int F(t)(R+r) dt = (R+r) \\int F(t) dt = J(R+r)\n$$\nThis angular impulse will cause a change in the angular momentum of the spool about point $P$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Change in Angular Momentum:** The initial state of the spool is rest, so its initial angular momentum about any point is zero ($L_{P,i} = 0$). The final angular momentum of the spool about the contact point $P$ is $L_{P,f}$. For a rigid body rotating about an instantaneous axis of rotation, the angular momentum is given by $L_P = I_P \\omega$, where $I_P$ is the moment of inertia about that instantaneous axis.\n\nUsing the parallel axis theorem, we can find $I_P$:\n$$\nI_P = I_{cm} + M d_{cm}^2\n$$\nHere, $I_{cm} = I = \\gamma M R^2$ is the moment of inertia about the center of mass, and $d_{cm} = R$ is the distance between the CM and the parallel axis through $P$.\n$$\nI_P = \\gamma M R^2 + M R^2 = M R^2 (1+\\gamma)\n$$\nThe final angular momentum is therefore $L_{P,f} = I_P \\omega = M R^2 (1+\\gamma) \\omega$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Angular Impulse-Momentum Theorem:** The theorem states that the total angular impulse equals the change in angular momentum:\n$$\n\\mathcal{J}_{\\tau, P} = \\Delta L_P = L_{P,f} - L_{P,i}\n$$\n$$\nJ(R+r) = M R^2 (1+\\gamma) \\omega - 0\n$$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Final Speeds:** From the equation above, we can solve for the final angular speed $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{J(R+r)}{M R^2 (1+\\gamma)}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the final speed of the center of mass, $v_{cm}$.\nThe condition for rolling without slipping is $v_{cm} = \\omega R$.
