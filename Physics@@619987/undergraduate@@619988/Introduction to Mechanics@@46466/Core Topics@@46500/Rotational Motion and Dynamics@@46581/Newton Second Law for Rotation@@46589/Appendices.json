This problem is a cornerstone for analyzing the dynamics of any rolling body.", "problem": "A large composite spool of cable rests on a rough horizontal floor, ensuring it rolls without slipping. The spool is constructed from two identical solid disks, each with mass $m_d = 10.0$ kg and radius $R = 0.500$ m, connected by a smaller solid cylinder that serves as an axle. The axle has a mass $m_c = 5.00$ kg and a radius $r = 0.200$ m.
