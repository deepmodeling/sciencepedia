{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To truly grasp the concept of rotational work, it's best to start from the fundamental definition of work as the integral of force over a path. This practice guides you through that very process in a rotational context. By analyzing a constant force applied to a rotating component, you will discover firsthand that only the part of the force acting tangentially to the circular path contributes to the work done, a key insight that directly leads to the definition of torque [@problem_id:2230658].", "problem": "A flat, circular satellite component of radius $R$ is floating in the vacuum of space, free to rotate about an axis passing through its center and perpendicular to its plane. A small thruster is mounted on the edge of this component. When activated, the thruster provides a constant force of magnitude $F$. This force vector lies in the plane of the circular component.\n\nDue to a slight manufacturing misalignment, the direction of the force is not purely tangential. Instead, it maintains a constant angle $\\phi$ with respect to the local radial line drawn from the center of the component to the thruster's point of application. The angle is defined such that $\\phi=0$ would correspond to a force pushing directly away from the center (radially outward), and $\\phi=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians would correspond to a force perfectly tangent to the edge in the direction of rotation.\n\nThe thruster is fired continuously as the component rotates through exactly one full revolution. Determine the total work $W$ done by the thruster's force on the component during this single revolution. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $F$, $R$, and $\\phi$.", "solution": "The work $W$ done by a force $\\vec{F}$ over a path is given by the line integral:\n$$W = \\int_{C} \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s}$$\nwhere $d\\vec{s}$ is the infinitesimal displacement vector along the path $C$.\n\nLet's set up a polar coordinate system $(r, \\theta)$ in the plane of the circular component, with the origin at the center. The thruster is located at a fixed radius $r=R$. The path of the thruster is a circle of radius $R$.\n\nThe infinitesimal displacement vector $d\\vec{s}$ for a point moving on this circle is purely tangential. Its magnitude is the arc length $ds = R d\\theta$, and its direction is the tangential unit vector $\\hat{\\theta}$. So, we can write:\n$$d\\vec{s} = R d\\theta \\, \\hat{\\theta}$$\n\nNext, we need to express the force vector $\\vec{F}$ in terms of the polar unit vectors, $\\hat{r}$ (radial) and $\\hat{\\theta}$ (tangential). The radial unit vector $\\hat{r}$ points from the center to the point of application. The tangential unit vector $\\hat{\\theta}$ is perpendicular to $\\hat{r}$ and points in the direction of motion.\n\nThe problem states that the force $\\vec{F}$ makes a constant angle $\\phi$ with the radial line. Based on the definition given, the component of the force along the radial direction is $F_r = F \\cos(\\phi)$, and the component along the tangential direction is $F_t = F \\sin(\\phi)$. Therefore, the force vector can be written as:\n$$\\vec{F} = F \\cos(\\phi) \\, \\hat{r} + F \\sin(\\phi) \\, \\hat{\\theta}$$\n\nNow we can compute the dot product $\\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s}$:\n$$\\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s} = (F \\cos(\\phi) \\, \\hat{r} + F \\sin(\\phi) \\, \\hat{\\theta}) \\cdot (R d\\theta \\, \\hat{\\theta})$$\n\nThe dot product of orthogonal unit vectors is zero ($\\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{\\theta} = 0$), and the dot product of a unit vector with itself is one ($\\hat{\\theta} \\cdot \\hat{\\theta} = 1$). Expanding the dot product gives:\n$$\\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s} = (F \\cos(\\phi))(R d\\theta)(\\hat{r} \\cdot \\hat{\\theta}) + (F \\sin(\\phi))(R d\\theta)(\\hat{\\theta} \\cdot \\hat{\\theta})$$\n$$\\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{s} = 0 + F R \\sin(\\phi) d\\theta$$\nThis confirms that only the tangential component of the force does work.\n\nThe total work done is the integral of this expression over one full revolution. A full revolution corresponds to the angle $\\theta$ changing from $0$ to $2\\pi$ radians.\n$$W = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} F R \\sin(\\phi) \\, d\\theta$$\n\nSince the force magnitude $F$, the radius $R$, and the angle $\\phi$ are all constants, we can take the term $F R \\sin(\\phi)$ outside the integral:\n$$W = F R \\sin(\\phi) \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta$$\n\nEvaluating the simple integral gives:\n$$W = F R \\sin(\\phi) [\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = F R \\sin(\\phi) (2\\pi - 0)$$\n$$W = 2 \\pi F R \\sin(\\phi)$$\n\nAlternatively, we can solve this problem using the concept of torque. The work done by a torque $\\tau$ over an angular displacement $\\Delta\\theta$ is $W = \\int \\tau \\, d\\theta$. The torque about the center is given by $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$, where $\\vec{r}$ is the position vector from the center to the point where the force is applied.\nHere, $\\vec{r} = R\\,\\hat{r}$.\n$$\\vec{\\tau} = (R\\,\\hat{r}) \\times (F \\cos(\\phi) \\, \\hat{r} + F \\sin(\\phi) \\, \\hat{\\theta})$$\n$$\\vec{\\tau} = R F \\cos(\\phi) (\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{r}) + R F \\sin(\\phi) (\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{\\theta})$$\nSince $\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{r} = 0$ and $\\hat{r} \\times \\hat{\\theta} = \\hat{k}$ (the unit vector perpendicular to the plane), the torque vector is:\n$$\\vec{\\tau} = R F \\sin(\\phi) \\, \\hat{k}$$\nThe magnitude of the torque is constant: $\\tau = R F \\sin(\\phi)$.\nThe work done for one revolution ($\\Delta\\theta=2\\pi$) is:\n$$W = \\tau \\Delta\\theta = (R F \\sin(\\phi))(2\\pi)$$\n$$W = 2 \\pi F R \\sin(\\phi)$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2 \\pi F R \\sin(\\phi)}$$", "id": "2230658"}, {"introduction": "Building on our understanding of rotational work, we can now employ one of the most powerful principles in mechanics: the work-energy theorem. This exercise presents a practical engineering scenario of spinning up a space habitat to generate artificial gravity.

The process is considered complete when the centripetal acceleration experienced by a person standing on the inner wall of the cylinder reaches a target value of $g_a$.\n\nDetermine an expression for the average power delivered by the motor during the entire spin-up period. Your answer should be in terms of $M$, $R$, $\\tau_0$, and $g_a$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the average power, $P_{\\text{avg}}$, delivered by the motor during the time it takes to spin up the space habitat. The average power is defined as the total work done, $W$, divided by the total time elapsed, $T$.\n\n$$P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{W}{T}$$\n\nOur first step is to determine the final state of the system, specifically its final angular velocity, $\\omega_f$. The condition for the spin-up to be complete is that the centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, at the radius $R$ is equal to $g_a$. The formula for centripetal acceleration is $a_c = \\omega^2 R$. Setting this equal to the target value gives us the final angular velocity:\n\n$$\\omega_f^2 R = g_a \\implies \\omega_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{g_a}{R}}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total work done by the motor. By the rotational work-energy theorem, the net work done on a rigid body is equal to the change in its rotational kinetic energy, $\\Delta K_{\\text{rot}}$. Since the habitat starts from rest ($K_{\\text{rot, initial}} = 0$), the work done is equal to the final rotational kinetic energy.\n\n$$W = \\Delta K_{\\text{rot}} = K_{\\text{rot, final}} - K_{\\text{rot, initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_f^2 - 0$$\n\nThe moment of inertia, $I$, for a thin-walled hollow cylinder about its central axis is $I = MR^2$.

The motor provides a constant torque $\\tau_0$. The rotational equation of motion is $\\tau_{\\text{net}} = I \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the angular acceleration. Since $\\tau_0$ is the only torque acting, we have:\n\n$$\\tau_0 = I \\alpha \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{\\tau_0}{I} = \\frac{\\tau_0}{MR^2}$$\n\nSince the torque is constant, the angular acceleration $\\alpha$ is also constant.
