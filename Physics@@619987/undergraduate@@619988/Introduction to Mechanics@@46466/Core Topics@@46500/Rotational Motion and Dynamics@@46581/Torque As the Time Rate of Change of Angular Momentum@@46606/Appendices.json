The astronaut's body can be modeled as a system of two rigid components: an \"upper body\" (torso and arms) and a \"lower body\" (waist and legs). These two components are connected at the waist and can rotate relative to one another about a common longitudinal axis (the z-axis) that passes through the astronaut's center of mass. To change their orientation without any external aid, the astronaut performs a specific two-stage maneuver.\n\nInitially, the astronaut is in a \"neutral\" posture where the moments of inertia of the upper body and lower body about the z-axis are identical, i.e., $I_U = I_L = I_0$.\n\n**Stage 1:** The astronaut first changes their body configuration by extending their arms and tucking their legs. This results in the upper body having a new moment of inertia $I_U = \\alpha I_0$ and the lower body having a new moment of inertia $I_L = \\beta I_0$, where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are dimensionless positive constants. While holding this asymmetric posture, the astronaut uses their internal muscles to twist their waist, causing the upper body to rotate through an angle $\\phi$ relative to the lower body.\n\n**Stage 2:** The astronaut then returns their arms and legs to the initial neutral posture, so the moments of inertia of the upper and lower body both revert to $I_0$.
