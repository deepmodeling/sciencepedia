The period of a physical pendulum for small oscillations is given by $T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{I}{mgL_{cm}}}$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia about the pivot point, $m$ is the mass of the object, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $L_{cm}$ is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass.\n\nFirst, let's identify the parameters given in the problem.\nThe mass of the disk is $M$.\nThe radius of the disk is $R = 25.0 \\text{ cm} = 0.250 \\text{ m}$.\nThe distance from the pivot to the center of the disk is $d = 10.0 \\text{ cm} = 0.100 \\text{ m}$. In this case, the center of the disk is its center of mass, so $L_{cm} = d$.\nThe acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$.\n\nNext, we need to find the moment of inertia $I$ of the disk about the pivot point. The moment of inertia of a uniform solid disk about an axis passing through its center of mass and perpendicular to its plane is $I_{cm} = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2$.\n\nTo find the moment of inertia about the pivot point, which is at a distance $d$ from the center of mass, we use the parallel-axis theorem:\n$I = I_{cm} + Md^2$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{cm}$:\n$I = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2 + Md^2$\n\nNow we can write the expression for the period $T$.
