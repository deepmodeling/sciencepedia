We will analyze the forces acting on the mass when it is displaced from its equilibrium position.\n\nLet's consider the general case of a vertical mass-spring system in a gravitational field with acceleration $g$. Let the vertical coordinate be $y$, with $y=0$ at the position where the spring is unstretched, and positive downwards. The net force on the mass $m$ is the sum of the gravitational force $F_g$ and the spring force $F_s$.\n$$F_{net} = F_g + F_s$$\nThe gravitational force is $F_g = mg$, acting downwards. The spring force is given by Hooke's Law, $F_s = -ky$, acting upwards.\nSo, Newton's second law for the mass is:\n$$m \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = mg - ky$$\nThe system has an equilibrium position, $y_{eq}$, where the net force is zero. At this position, the upward spring force balances the downward gravitational force:\n$$mg - ky_{eq} = 0 \\implies y_{eq} = \\frac{mg}{k}$$\nThis equilibrium position is the point around which the mass will oscillate. To analyze the oscillation, it is convenient to define a new coordinate, $x$, which represents the displacement from this equilibrium position:\n$$x = y - y_{eq} \\implies y = x + y_{eq}$$\nThe acceleration is $\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$. Substituting these into the equation of motion:\n$$m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = mg - k(x + y_{eq})$$\nNow, substitute the expression for $y_{eq}$:\n$$m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = mg - k\\left(x + \\frac{mg}{k}\\right) = mg - kx - mg$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -kx$$\nRearranging this gives the standard differential equation for Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):\n$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\frac{k}{m}x = 0$$\nThis equation is of the form $\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \\omega^2 x = 0$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillation. By comparing the two equations, we find:\n$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{k}{m} \\implies \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}$$\nThe period of oscillation, $T$, is related to the angular frequency by $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$. Therefore, the period of the vertical mass-spring oscillator is:\n$$T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$$\nThis is a crucial result. The period of a mass-spring system depends only on the mass $m$ and the spring constant $k$. It is independent of the local acceleration due to gravity, $g$. The presence of gravity only serves to shift the equilibrium position of the oscillation.\n\nNow we can apply this result to the three scenarios:\n1.  **On Earth:** The gravitational acceleration is $g_E$. The period is $T_E = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$.\n2.  **On the Moon:** The gravitational acceleration is $g_M = g_E/6$. Since the period is independent of $g$, the period will be the same: $T_M = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$. The only difference is that the equilibrium position will be at a smaller stretch, $y_{eq,M} = \\frac{mg_M}{k}$.\n3.  **In Orbit:** The effective gravitational acceleration is $g_{ISS} \\approx 0$. In this case, the gravitational force is negligible, and the equilibrium position is at $y_{eq,ISS} = 0$ (the spring's natural length). The equation of motion is simply $m\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -ky$, which is identical in form to the equation for the displacement $x$ in the gravitational cases. The resulting period is $T_{ISS} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$.\n\nSince the mass $m$ and the spring constant $k$ are the same in all three experiments, the periods must all be equal.\n$$T_E = T_M = T_{ISS} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{k}}$$\nTherefore, the correct relationship is $T_E = T_M = T_{ISS}$.
