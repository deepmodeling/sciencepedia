The initial design consists of a uniform solid disk of mass $M_d$ and radius $R$, suspended horizontally from its center by a thin wire. This setup forms a torsional pendulum that oscillates with a period $T$. For a revised design, the engineer wants to replace the solid disk with a uniform solid sphere of the same radius $R$ and mass $M_s$. The new sphere will be suspended from its center using an identical wire. What must be the mass of the sphere, $M_s$, in terms of the mass of the disk, $M_d$, for the new torsional pendulum to have the exact same oscillation period $T$?", "solution": "The period of a torsional pendulum is given by the formula $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I}{\\kappa}}$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the oscillating object about the axis of rotation, and $\\kappa$ is the torsional constant of the suspension wire.\n\nFirst, let's write the expression for the period of the initial design, which uses the solid disk. The object is a uniform solid disk of mass $M_d$ and radius $R$. It is suspended from its center, so the axis of rotation is the axis perpendicular to the plane of the disk and passing through its center. The moment of inertia of a uniform solid disk about this axis is given by:\n$$I_d = \\frac{1}{2} M_d R^2$$\nThe period of the disk-based pendulum, which we are told is $T$, is therefore:\n$$T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I_d}{\\kappa}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} M_d R^2}{\\kappa}}$$\n\nNext, let's write the expression for the period of the revised design, which uses the solid sphere. The object is a uniform solid sphere of mass $M_s$ and radius $R$. It is suspended from its center, so the axis of rotation passes through its center. The moment of inertia of a uniform solid sphere about an axis passing through its center is given by:\n$$I_s = \\frac{2}{5} M_s R^2$$\nThe suspension wire is identical to the one used for the disk, so its torsional constant is also $\\kappa$.
