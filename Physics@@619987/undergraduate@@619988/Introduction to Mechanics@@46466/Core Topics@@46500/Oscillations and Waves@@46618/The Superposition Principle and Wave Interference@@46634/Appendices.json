This practice [@problem_id:2224847] translates physics into artistry, exploring the technique musicians use to produce \"artificial harmonics.\" You will determine precisely where to pluck and touch a string to isolate a desired harmonic, gaining insight into how specific modes can be selectively excited or suppressed.", "problem": "A musician is practicing on a stringed instrument, where a string of total length $L$ is fixed at both ends, located at positions $x=0$ and $x=L$. They want to produce a specific 'artificial harmonic,' which requires the string to vibrate predominantly in its third harmonic mode ($n=3$). To accomplish this, they use a two-part technique: they pluck the string at a point $x_p$ and simultaneously touch it lightly at a point $x_t$.\n\nThe physics of this technique is as follows: plucking at a position most effectively excites the standing wave modes (harmonics) that have an antinode at that position, while suppressing modes that have a node there. The light touch at a different position enforces a node at that point, which damps out any harmonic that does not naturally have a node at that location.\n\nTo begin, the musician chooses a plucking point $x_p$ that is an antinode of the desired third harmonic ($n=3$) and is also a node of the unwanted second harmonic ($n=2$). This choice maximizes the initial energy of the third harmonic while simultaneously preventing the second harmonic from being excited. After this, the only significant unwanted mode remaining is the fundamental ($n=1$). To eliminate it, the musician's light touch at $x_t$ must suppress the fundamental mode while allowing the third harmonic to persist.\n\nAssuming the musician is looking for a touch point within the open length of the string ($0 < x_t < L$), determine the smallest possible distance from the $x=0$ end where they should touch the string. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $L$.", "solution": "The solution to this problem involves determining the positions of nodes and antinodes for different harmonics on a string fixed at both ends, and using these properties to satisfy the conditions described in the problem statement.\n\nStep 1: Define the positions of nodes and antinodes.\nFor a string of length $L$ fixed at $x=0$ and $x=L$, the standing wave for the $n$-th harmonic has a displacement pattern proportional to $\\sin(k_n x)$, where the wave number is $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$.\n- Nodes occur where the amplitude is always zero, i.e., where $\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}) = 0$. This condition is met when $\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} = m\\pi$ for an integer $m$. The positions of the nodes are therefore $x = \\frac{m L}{n}$, for $m = 0, 1, 2, ..., n$.\n- Antinodes occur where the amplitude is maximum, i.e., where $|\\sin(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L})| = 1$. This condition is met when $\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} = (m + \\frac{1}{2})\\pi$ for an integer $m$. The positions of the antinodes are therefore $x = \\frac{(m + 1/2) L}{n}$, for $m = 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the plucking point, $x_p$.\nThe problem states that the plucking point $x_p$ must be a node of the second harmonic ($n=2$) and an antinode of the third harmonic ($n=3$).\n- For the second harmonic ($n=2$), the nodes are at $x = \\frac{m L}{2}$ for $m=0, 1, 2$. The nodes are at $x=0$, $x=L/2$, and $x=L$. Since plucking occurs on the string, we consider the internal node, $x=L/2$.\n- For the third harmonic ($n=3$), the antinodes are at $x = \\frac{(m + 1/2) L}{3}$ for $m=0, 1, 2$. The antinodes are at $x = \\frac{L}{6}$, $x = \\frac{3L}{6} = \\frac{L}{2}$, and $x = \\frac{5L}{6}$.\nThe only position that is both a node for $n=2$ and an antinode for $n=3$ is $x_p = \\frac{L}{2}$. Plucking at this point excites the third harmonic strongly while suppressing the second harmonic.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conditions for the touch point, $x_t$.\nThe touch point $x_t$ must suppress the fundamental mode ($n=1$) and allow the third harmonic ($n=3$) to sound.\n- To allow the third harmonic ($n=3$) to persist, the touch must not damp it. This means the touch point $x_t$ must be a location where the third harmonic has zero amplitude, i.e., a node of the $n=3$ mode. The nodes for the third harmonic are at $x = \\frac{m L}{3}$ for $m=0, 1, 2, 3$. The internal nodes (for $0 < x_t < L$) are at $x_t = \\frac{L}{3}$ and $x_t = \\frac{2L}{3}$.\n- To suppress the fundamental mode ($n=1$), touching the string at $x_t$ must damp its vibration. This will happen as long as $x_t$ is not a node of the fundamental mode. The nodes for the fundamental mode ($n=1$) are only at the ends, $x=0$ and $x=L$. Both of our candidate touch points, $L/3$ and $2L/3$, are not nodes for the fundamental mode. Touching at either of these locations will effectively damp the fundamental because it has a non-zero amplitude at these points.\n\nStep 4: Identify the final answer.\nThe possible locations for the touch point $x_t$ that satisfy all conditions are $x_t = L/3$ and $x_t = 2L/3$. The problem asks for the smallest possible distance from the $x=0$ end, which corresponds to the smallest value of $x_t$.\nComparing the two possible values, $\\frac{L}{3}$ is smaller than $\\frac{2L}{3}$.\nTherefore, the smallest distance from the end is $\\frac{L}{3}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{L}{3}}$$", "id": "2224847"}, {"introduction": "The superposition principle extends beyond standing waves on a string to the interference of waves from multiple sources in space.
