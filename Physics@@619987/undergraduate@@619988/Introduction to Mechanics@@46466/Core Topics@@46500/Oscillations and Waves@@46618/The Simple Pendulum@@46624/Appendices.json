At a particular instant, the cable makes a non-zero angle $\\theta_0$ with respect to the vertical. At this precise moment, the wrecking ball is swinging downwards towards the lowest point of its arc with a known tangential speed $v_0$. Assuming that air resistance can be neglected and the cable does not stretch, derive a symbolic expression for the speed of the wrecking ball when it reaches the lowest point of its swing. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the speed of the wrecking ball at the lowest point of its swing. Since we are given initial conditions (position and speed) and asked for a final speed at a different position, and we are told to neglect non-conservative forces like air resistance, the principle of conservation of mechanical energy is the most direct method to solve this problem.\n\nThe total mechanical energy $E$ of the system is the sum of its kinetic energy $K$ and its potential energy $U$. The conservation of mechanical energy states that the total energy at the initial state is equal to the total energy at the final state, i.e., $E_i = E_f$, or $K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$.\n\nLet's define the reference level for gravitational potential energy ($U=0$) to be the lowest point of the wrecking ball's swing.\n\n**Initial State:**\nThe wrecking ball is at an angle $\\theta_0$ with the vertical.\nThe kinetic energy at this initial state is given by $K_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$, where $v_0$ is the initial tangential speed.\nTo find the initial potential energy $U_i$, we need to determine the initial height $h_i$ of the wrecking ball relative to our reference level. The length of the cable is $L$. When the ball is at an angle $\\theta_0$, its vertical distance from the suspension point is $L\\cos(\\theta_0)$. At the lowest point (our reference level), the vertical distance from the suspension point is $L$. Therefore, the initial height $h_i$ above the lowest point is the difference between these two distances:\n$$h_i = L - L\\cos(\\theta_0) = L(1 - \\cos(\\theta_0))$$\nThe initial gravitational potential energy is then $U_i = mgh_i = mgL(1 - \\cos(\\theta_0))$.\nThe total initial mechanical energy is:\n$$E_i = K_i + U_i = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + mgL(1 - \\cos(\\theta_0))$$\n\n**Final State:**\nThe wrecking ball is at the lowest point of its swing. Let's denote its speed at this point as $v_f$.\nAt this final state, the height is $h_f = 0$ by our definition of the reference level. Thus, the final potential energy is $U_f = 0$.\nThe kinetic energy at the final state is $K_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$.\nThe total final mechanical energy is:\n$$E_f = K_f + U_f = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + 0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$$\n\n**Applying Conservation of Energy:**\nNow, we set the initial energy equal to the final energy:\n$$E_i = E_f$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 + mgL(1 - \\cos(\\theta_0)) = \\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2$$\nWe can see that the mass $m$ is present in every term, so it can be canceled out from the equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}v_0^2 + gL(1 - \\cos(\\theta_0)) = \\frac{1}{2}v_f^2$$\nOur goal is to solve for the final speed, $v_f$. We multiply the entire equation by 2:\n$$v_0^2 + 2gL(1 - \\cos(\\theta_0)) = v_f^2$$\nFinally, we take the square root of both sides to find $v_f$. Since speed is a non-negative quantity, we take the positive root:\n$$v_f = \\sqrt{v_0^2 + 2gL(1 - \\cos(\\theta_0))}$$\nThis is the final expression for the speed of the wrecking ball at the lowest point of its swing.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{v_0^{2} + 2gL(1 - \\cos(\\theta_0))}}$$", "id": "2224316"}, {"introduction": "While energy conservation effectively determines a pendulum's speed, it does not reveal the internal forces within the system, such as the tension in the string.
