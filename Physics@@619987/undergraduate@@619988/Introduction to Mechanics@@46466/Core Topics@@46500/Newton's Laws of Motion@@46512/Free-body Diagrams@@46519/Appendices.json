Let the links be numbered 1 (top), 2 (middle), and 3 (bottom). Each link has mass $m$. Since the system is in static equilibrium, the net force on any link or any combination of links is zero. We will apply Newton's First Law, $\\sum \\vec{F} = 0$, to different parts of the chain.\n\nFirst, let's determine the force $F_{3 \\to 2}$ exerted by the bottom link (link 3) on the middle link (link 2). To do this, we can analyze the forces acting on link 3. The forces on link 3 are:\n1.  Its own weight, $W_3 = mg$, acting downwards.\n2.  The force exerted by link 2 on link 3, which we denote as $F_{2 \\to 3}$. This is an upward tension force.\n\nAccording to Newton's First Law, since link 3 is in equilibrium, the net force on it is zero. In the vertical direction, we have:\n$$\n\\sum F_{y, \\text{link 3}} = F_{2 \\to 3} - W_3 = 0\n$$\n$$\nF_{2 \\to 3} = W_3 = mg\n$$\nNow, by Newton's Third Law, the force exerted by link 3 on link 2 ($F_{3 \\to 2}$) is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted by link 2 on link 3 ($F_{2 \\to 3}$). Therefore, the magnitude is:\n$$\nF_{3 \\to 2} = F_{2 \\to 3} = mg\n$$\nThis force $F_{3 \\to 2}$ acts downwards on link 2.\n\nNext, we determine the force $F_{1 \\to 2}$ exerted by the top link (link 1) on the middle link (link 2). We can analyze the forces acting on the middle link (link 2). The forces on link 2 are:\n1.  Its own weight, $W_2 = mg$, acting downwards.\n2.  The force from link 1, $F_{1 \\to 2}$, acting upwards.\n3.  The force from link 3, $F_{3 \\to 2}$, acting downwards.\n\nApplying Newton's First Law to link 2:\n$$\n\\sum F_{y, \\text{link 2}} = F_{1 \\to 2} - W_2 - F_{3 \\to 2} = 0\n$$\nWe can now solve for $F_{1 \\to 2}$:\n$$\nF_{1 \\to 2} = W_2 + F_{3 \\to 2}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values $W_2 = mg$ and $F_{3 \\to 2} = mg$:\n$$\nF_{1 \\to 2} = mg + mg = 2mg\n$$\nAlternatively, we could have found $F_{1 \\to 2}$ by considering the system consisting of links 2 and 3 together. The total mass of this system is $m+m=2m$. The total weight is $2mg$. The force $F_{1 \\to 2}$ is the upward tension that must support this combined weight. Thus, for this subsystem to be in equilibrium:\n$$\nF_{1 \\to 2} - (m+m)g = 0\n$$\n$$\nF_{1 \\to 2} = 2mg\n$$\nThis confirms our previous result.\n\nSo, the magnitudes of the forces are $F_{1 \\to 2} = 2mg$ and $F_{3 \\to 2} = mg$.
