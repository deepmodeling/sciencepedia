{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "This first practice is a classic thought experiment that gets to the very core of Newton's First Law. By imagining a frictionless environment, we can isolate the principle of inertia from other everyday effects. This exercise challenges the common intuition that a rotating surface 'flings' objects outward, forcing us to distinguish between what an observer in an inertial frame sees versus what one in an accelerating frame perceives. Answering this correctly is a crucial first step toward building a solid conceptual foundation for dynamics [@problem_id:2196218].", "problem": "A small, smooth puck is placed on a large, horizontal turntable at a radial distance $R_0$ from its center. The surface of the turntable is considered to be perfectly frictionless. The system is initially at rest. At time $t=0$, the turntable is abruptly spun up, thereafter rotating with a constant angular velocity $\\omega$ about its central axis. A stationary observer, positioned directly above the setup in an inertial frame of reference, tracks the motion of the puck.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the trajectory of the puck for $t > 0$ as seen by the stationary observer?\n\nA. The puck moves in a perfect circle of radius $R_0$ centered on the axis of rotation.\n\nB. The puck moves in a straight line, radially outwards from the center of the turntable.\n\nC. The puck remains stationary at its initial position.\n\nD. The puck moves in a straight line tangent to the circle of radius $R_0$ at its initial location.\n\nE. The puck moves along a path that spirals outwards from its initial position.", "solution": "The solution to this problem lies in a direct application of Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the law of inertia. This law is evaluated from the perspective of an inertial frame of reference, which is explicitly stated to be the frame of the stationary observer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Forces**\nFirst, we must identify all the forces acting on the puck for $t > 0$.\n1.  **Gravity:** The Earth exerts a downward gravitational force, $F_g = mg$, where $m$ is the mass of the puck and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n2.  **Normal Force:** The turntable exerts an upward normal force, $N$, on the puck, perpendicular to the surface.\n\nSince the turntable is horizontal and the puck does not accelerate in the vertical direction, the normal force must exactly balance the force of gravity. Thus, $N = mg$. The net force in the vertical direction is zero.\n\n3.  **Horizontal Forces:** The problem states that the turntable surface is perfectly frictionless. This means there is no horizontal force (like friction) that the turntable can exert on the puck. Since there are no other sources of horizontal force (e.g., air resistance is assumed negligible), the net horizontal force on the puck is zero.\n\nTherefore, the total net force on the puck, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}}$, is zero.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Newton's First Law**\nNewton's First Law states that an object's velocity will not change unless it is acted upon by a net external force. In other words, if $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = 0$, then the object's acceleration $\\vec{a} = 0$, and its velocity $\\vec{v}$ must be constant.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Initial State of Motion**\nAt time $t  0$, the entire system, including the puck, is at rest. This means the initial velocity of the puck is $\\vec{v}_{\\text{initial}} = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Subsequent Motion**\nSince the net force on the puck is zero for all $t > 0$, its velocity must remain constant. Because its initial velocity was zero, its velocity must remain zero for all subsequent times.\nA constant velocity of zero means the puck does not move. It remains at the exact spatial coordinates it occupied at $t=0$. The turntable rotates underneath it, but the puck's position in the stationary observer's frame does not change.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Options**\n*   **A. The puck moves in a perfect circle:** This would require a constant net force directed towards the center of the circle (a centripetal force). Since there is no friction, no such force exists.\n*   **B. The puck moves in a straight line, radially outwards:** This describes the motion as it would appear to an observer on the rotating turntable (a non-inertial frame), due to the fictitious \"centrifugal force.\" This is not the motion seen by the stationary observer.\n*   **C. The puck remains stationary at its initial position:** This is the correct conclusion from applying Newton's First Law in the inertial frame of the observer. Its velocity was zero and with no net force, it stays zero.\n*   **D. The puck moves in a straight line tangent...:** This would be the case if the puck were initially moving with the turntable and was suddenly released. However, the puck starts from rest, so its initial velocity is zero, not a tangential velocity of $\\omega R_0$.\n*   **E. The puck moves along a path that spirals outwards:** This is another trajectory that might be perceived in the non-inertial frame of the turntable due to a combination of fictitious forces (centrifugal and Coriolis). It is incorrect for the inertial observer.\n\nTherefore, the puck remains stationary as viewed by the stationary observer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2196218"}, {"introduction": "Newton's laws often seem simple, but they contain subtleties that can easily lead to misconceptions. This practice addresses one of the most common pitfalls: confusing constant speed with constant velocity. Through a debate about a satellite in orbit, we explore why an object moving in a circle at a constant speed is, in fact, accelerating and therefore must be subject to a net force. Mastering this distinction is essential for correctly applying Newton's laws to any form of non-linear motion [@problem_id:2196223].", "problem": "Two first-year physics students, Leo and Maria, are debating the forces acting on a communications satellite. The satellite is in a stable, perfectly circular orbit around the Earth, moving at a constant speed $v$. They make the following arguments:\n\n**Leo's Argument:** \"An object's state of motion is constant unless a net force acts on it. Since the satellite's speed is constant, its motion is uniform. Therefore, according to Newton's First Law, the net force on the satellite must be zero. The inward pull of Earth's gravity must be exactly canceled by an equal and opposite outward force, often called the centrifugal force, resulting in a state of equilibrium.\"\n\n**Maria's Argument:** \"Newton's First Law applies to constant *velocity*, not just constant speed. Velocity is a vector, and since the satellite is moving in a circle, its direction is constantly changing. This change in velocity means the satellite is accelerating. According to Newton's Second Law, this acceleration requires a non-zero net force, which is provided solely by Earth's gravity.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical analysis of their arguments?\n\nA. Leo is correct. The existence of a 'centrifugal force' is essential for creating the force balance required for a stable orbit.\n\nB. Maria is correct. A change in the direction of velocity constitutes acceleration, which implies a net force is acting on the satellite.\n\nC. Both students are partially correct. The net force is indeed zero, but this is because gravity and the force from the satellite's thrusters cancel each other out to maintain a constant speed.\n\nD. Both students are incorrect. There is a net force, but it acts tangentially to the orbit to continually push the satellite forward and maintain its constant speed.\n\nE. Both students are correct in an abstract sense. Leo's argument is valid in the satellite's rotating frame of reference, while Maria's is valid in an inertial frame fixed on Earth.", "solution": "Take an inertial frame with origin at Earth’s center. For a satellite of mass $m$ moving at constant speed $v$ on a circle of radius $r$, the velocity vector changes its direction uniformly. The kinematics of uniform circular motion give a centripetal acceleration\n$$\n\\vec{a}=-\\frac{v^{2}}{r}\\,\\hat{r},\n$$\nwhich is nonzero and points radially inward.\n\nBy Newton’s Second Law,\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}}=m\\vec{a}=-m\\frac{v^{2}}{r}\\,\\hat{r}.\n$$\nThe only real force needed to sustain this motion is Earth’s gravity,\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{g}=-\\frac{G M m}{r^{2}}\\,\\hat{r}.\n$$\nFor a circular orbit, the centripetal requirement is provided by gravity alone, so the magnitudes must satisfy\n$$\n\\frac{G M m}{r^{2}}=m\\frac{v^{2}}{r}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad v^{2}=\\frac{G M}{r}.\n$$\nThus, in an inertial frame the net force is not zero; it is inward and equal to gravity. There is no outward real force; the so-called “centrifugal force” does not appear in an inertial-frame force balance.\n\nIf one instead adopts a frame rotating with the satellite’s orbital angular speed $\\Omega$, where $\\Omega=\\frac{v}{r}$ and the satellite is at rest in that frame, Newton’s laws can be written with fictitious forces included. In that non-inertial frame the centrifugal fictitious force\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{\\text{cf}}=m\\Omega^{2}r\\,\\hat{r}\n$$\nbalances gravity, and the Coriolis force vanishes for an object at rest in the rotating frame. The “balance” invoked by Leo is therefore only meaningful in this rotating, non-inertial description and requires introducing fictitious forces; it is not a statement about real forces in an inertial frame.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: no real outward “centrifugal” force is required in an inertial frame; gravity alone supplies the needed centripetal force.\n- B is correct: changing direction means acceleration; by Newton’s Second Law, a nonzero inward net force acts, provided by gravity.\n- C is incorrect: thrusters are not required to maintain a circular orbit; if they canceled gravity, the satellite would not follow a circular path.\n- D is incorrect: the net force is radial (centripetal), not tangential, in uniform circular motion.\n- E is misleading: Leo’s “force balance” only holds in a non-inertial rotating frame using a fictitious centrifugal force, while Maria’s statement is the correct inertial-frame description; additionally, calling a frame “fixed on Earth” inertial is not accurate.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate physical analysis among the given choices is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2196223"}, {"introduction": "True mastery of a concept comes from being able to apply it in surprising and unfamiliar situations.
