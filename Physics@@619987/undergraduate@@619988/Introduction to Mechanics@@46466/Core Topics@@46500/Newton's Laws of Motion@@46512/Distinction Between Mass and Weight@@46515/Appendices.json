In an environment far from any significant gravitational pull, objects are effectively \"weightless,\" yet they still possess mass. This practice challenges you to determine the relative masses of objects by observing their response to a known force, directly probing their inertiaâ€”their inherent resistance to acceleration [@problem_id:2187158]. This exercise is crucial for understanding that mass is an intrinsic property of matter, independent of gravity.", "problem": "An astronaut aboard a deep-space research vessel, far from any significant gravitational fields, is tasked with sorting three objects. The objects are sealed in identical, opaque containers labeled 1, 2, and 3, with corresponding unknown masses $m_1$, $m_2$, and $m_3$. To determine the relative masses, the astronaut uses a device that can apply a constant calibrated force of magnitude $F_0$ to an object for a precise duration of time $\\Delta t$. The experiment is performed on each container, starting from rest relative to the vessel. A motion sensor measures the final speed of each container at the exact moment the force is no longer applied. The experimental results are as follows:\n\n-   Container 1 reaches a final speed of $v_1 = 3.50 \\text{ m/s}$.\n-   Container 2 reaches a final speed of $v_2 = 2.10 \\text{ m/s}$.\n-   Container 3 reaches a final speed of $v_3 = 4.80 \\text{ m/s}$.\n\nBased on these experimental results, what is the correct ordering of the masses from least to greatest?\n\nA. $m_2 < m_1 < m_3$\n\nB. $m_3 < m_1 < m_2$\n\nC. $m_1 < m_2 < m_3$\n\nD. $m_3 < m_2 < m_1$\n\nE. The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.", "solution": "The fundamental principle governing the motion of the containers is Newton's Second Law of Motion. This law states that the net force applied to an object is equal to the product of its mass and its acceleration, $F = ma$. In this scenario, the only horizontal force acting on each container is the constant force $F_0$ applied by the device.\n\nFor any given container of mass $m$, the acceleration $a$ is constant because the force $F_0$ is constant. We can express the acceleration in terms of the force and mass:\n$$a = \\frac{F_0}{m}$$\nThis equation shows that for a constant applied force, the acceleration of an object is inversely proportional to its mass. A more massive object will experience a smaller acceleration, while a less massive object will experience a larger acceleration.\n\nThe experiment measures the final speed $v$ of each container after the force has been applied for a duration $\\Delta t$. Since each container starts from rest ($v_{\\text{initial}} = 0$) and experiences constant acceleration, we can use the following kinematic equation:\n$$v = v_{\\text{initial}} + a \\Delta t$$\nSubstituting $v_{\\text{initial}} = 0$, we get:\n$$v = a \\Delta t$$\nNow, we can substitute the expression for acceleration ($a = F_0/m$) into this kinematic equation:\n$$v = \\left(\\frac{F_0}{m}\\right) \\Delta t$$\nTo determine the relationship between mass and the measured final speed, we can rearrange this equation to solve for the mass $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{F_0 \\Delta t}{v}$$\nIn this experiment, the applied force $F_0$ and the time duration $\\Delta t$ are the same for all three containers. This means that the product $F_0 \\Delta t$ is a constant. Therefore, the mass $m$ of each container is inversely proportional to its measured final speed $v$.\n$$m \\propto \\frac{1}{v}$$\nThis relationship implies that the container with the highest final speed will have the lowest mass, and the container with the lowest final speed will have the highest mass.\n\nNow, let's compare the measured final speeds for the three containers:\n$v_1 = 3.50 \\text{ m/s}$\n$v_2 = 2.10 \\text{ m/s}$\n$v_3 = 4.80 \\text{ m/s}$\n\nOrdering these speeds from lowest to highest gives:\n$v_2 < v_1 < v_3$\n$(2.10 \\text{ m/s} < 3.50 \\text{ m/s} < 4.80 \\text{ m/s})$\n\nSince mass is inversely proportional to speed ($m \\propto 1/v$), the ordering of the masses will be the reverse of the ordering of the speeds. Therefore, the container with the lowest speed ($v_2$) has the highest mass ($m_2$), and the container with the highest speed ($v_3$) has the lowest mass ($m_3$).\n\nThe ordering of the masses from greatest to least is:\n$m_2 > m_1 > m_3$\n\nThe problem asks for the ordering of the masses from least to greatest, which is:\n$m_3 < m_1 < m_2$\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. $m_2 < m_1 < m_3$\nB. $m_3 < m_1 < m_2$\nC. $m_1 < m_2 < m_3$\nD. $m_3 < m_2 < m_1$\nE.

Along the horizontal direction, the only force component (neglecting air resistance) is the horizontal component of the thrust, denoted $T_{accel}$. Applying Newton's second law horizontally,\n$$\\sum F_{x} = M a_{x} \\implies T_{accel} = M a.$$\nConcurrently, vertical force balance requires the vertical thrust component to equal $M g$ to keep $a_{y}=0$, but only the horizontal component magnitude is requested.\n\nTherefore, the required expressions are $T_{hover} = M g$ and $T_{accel} = M a$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} M g & M a \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2187122"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice delves into the practical challenges and common misconceptions in measuring mass.
