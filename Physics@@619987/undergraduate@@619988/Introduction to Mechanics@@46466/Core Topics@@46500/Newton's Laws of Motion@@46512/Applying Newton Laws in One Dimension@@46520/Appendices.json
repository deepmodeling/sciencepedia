This first practice problem explores static equilibrium in a system involving friction, a force that is crucial to analyze but often tricky. By determining the range of masses that keep a crate stationary, you will practice setting up free-body diagrams, applying the condition $\\Sigma \\vec{F} = 0$, and, most importantly, grappling with the nature of static friction as a reactive force that adjusts its magnitude up to a maximum value, $\\mu_s N$ [@problem_id:2177706].", "problem": "A large crate of mass $M$ is positioned on a horizontal factory floor. The coefficient of static friction between the crate and the floor is $\\mu_s$. A light, inextensible cable is attached to the crate, runs horizontally, and passes over an ideal (frictionless and massless) pulley mounted at the edge of a pit in the floor. A counterweight of mass $m$ is attached to the free end of the cable, hanging vertically into the pit. We wish to find the range of masses for the counterweight, $m$, that will ensure the crate remains stationary.\n\nCalculate the sum of the minimum possible mass, $m_{min}$, and the maximum possible mass, $m_{max}$, of the counterweight for which the crate remains in static equilibrium. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $M$ and $\\mu_s$. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.", "solution": "Let the rope tension be $T$. Because the cable is light and inextensible and the pulley is ideal (massless and frictionless), the tension is the same throughout the rope.\n\nFor the hanging counterweight of mass $m$, static equilibrium requires the net vertical force to be zero. Applying Newton’s first law,\n$$\n\\sum F_{y} = 0 \\implies T - m g = 0 \\implies T = m g.\n$$\n\nFor the crate of mass $M$ on the horizontal floor, let the static friction force be $f_{s}$, acting opposite the tendency of motion.

This problem introduces a classic setup, a modified Atwood machine, to explore the dynamics of a connected system. The key skill you'll develop here is the ability to analyze a system at two levels: first, by treating the connected objects as a single entity to find the overall acceleration, and second, by isolating one part of the system to determine the internal forces, such as the contact force between the platform and the instrument [@problem_id:2177659].
