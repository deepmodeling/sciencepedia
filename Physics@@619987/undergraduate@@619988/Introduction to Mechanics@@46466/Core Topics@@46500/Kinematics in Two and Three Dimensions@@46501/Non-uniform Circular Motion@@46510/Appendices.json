It is pivoted at one end, allowing it to rotate freely in a vertical plane under the influence of gravity. A small, dense object of mass $m$ is attached to the free end of the rod.\n\nThe motion of the arm is controlled by a motor at the pivot. The arm starts from rest at its lowest vertical position at time $t=0$. Its subsequent angular velocity is precisely described by the function $\\omega(t) = \\omega_0 \\sin(\\beta t)$, where $\\omega_0$ and $\\beta$ are positive constants that characterize the motor's performance.

We can find this force using Newton's second law. The net force on the mass $m$ is the vector sum of the force from the rod and the force of gravity, $\\vec{F}_{g}$.\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{rod}} + \\vec{F}_{g} = m\\vec{a}\n$$\n\nFrom this, the force from the rod is $\\vec{F}_{\\text{rod}} = m\\vec{a} - \\vec{F}_{g}$. To find its magnitude, we must first determine the acceleration vector $\\vec{a}$ and the gravitational force vector $\\vec{F}_{g}$ in a convenient coordinate system.\n\nLet's use a polar coordinate system with the origin at the pivot. We define the angle $\\theta$ as the angle of the rod with respect to the downward vertical direction, such that $\\theta=0$ corresponds to the lowest point of the motion. The unit vector $\\hat{r}$ points radially outward along the rod, and the unit vector $\\hat{\\theta}$ is perpendicular to the rod, pointing in the direction of increasing $\\theta$.\n\nFirst, we determine the kinematic quantities. The mass moves in a circle of constant radius $r=L$.\nThe angular velocity is given as $\\omega(t) = \\omega_0 \\sin(\\beta t)$.\nThe angular acceleration is the time derivative of the angular velocity:\n$$\n\\alpha(t) = \\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\omega_0 \\sin(\\beta t) \\right) = \\omega_0 \\beta \\cos(\\beta t)\n$$\n\nThe acceleration vector in polar coordinates for circular motion is given by $\\vec{a} = a_r \\hat{r} + a_t \\hat{\\theta}$, where $a_r$ is the radial acceleration and $a_t$ is the tangential acceleration.\n$$\na_r = -r\\omega^2 = -L\\omega^2\n$$\n$$\na_t = r\\alpha = L\\alpha\n$$\nSo, the acceleration vector is $\\vec{a} = -L\\omega^2 \\hat{r} + L\\alpha \\hat{\\theta}$.\n\nNext, we express the gravitational force in this coordinate system.
