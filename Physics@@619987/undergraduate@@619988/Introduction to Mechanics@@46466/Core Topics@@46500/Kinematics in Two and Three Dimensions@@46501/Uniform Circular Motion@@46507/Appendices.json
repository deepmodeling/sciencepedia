To prevent excessive stress on the suspension, a safety protocol is programmed into the vehicle's computer. This protocol triggers an alert if the measured normal force $N$ at any point exceeds a threshold value, which is defined as a multiple $\\alpha$ of the vehicle's static weight. The vehicle's static weight is $mg$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
