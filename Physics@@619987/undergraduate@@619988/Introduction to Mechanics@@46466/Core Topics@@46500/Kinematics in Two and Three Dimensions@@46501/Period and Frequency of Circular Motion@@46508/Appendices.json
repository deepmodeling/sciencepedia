This first exercise connects the dots between the forces an object experiences and the period of its circular motion. By analyzing a vehicle on a perfectly banked curve, you'll derive the precise period required for motion without relying on friction, a core principle in designing safe roads and railways. This practice solidifies the idea that the period, $T$, is a direct consequence of the system's dynamics.

The track is banked at a constant angle $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal. The train is engineered to travel at a constant speed such that the combination of gravity and the normal force from the track provides the exact centripetal force required to navigate the turn. In this ideal scenario, no lateral magnetic forces are needed to keep the train on its circular path.\n\nLet $g$ be the local gravitational acceleration. Derive an expression for the period of the train's revolution around the track in terms of $R$, $\\theta$, and $g$.", "solution": "Let the mass of the maglev train be $m$ and its constant speed be $v$. The train travels in a horizontal circle of radius $R$. The time for one complete revolution is the period, $T$. The period is related to the speed and radius by the formula for the circumference of the circle:\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi R}{v}$$\nTo find the period $T$, we first need to determine the speed $v$ based on the forces acting on the train.\n\nThere are two forces acting on the train:\n1.  The gravitational force, $F_g = mg$, acting vertically downward.\n2.  The normal force, $N$, exerted by the banked track, acting perpendicular to the track's surface.\n\nWe can analyze these forces by resolving them into horizontal and vertical components. Let's set up a coordinate system where the y-axis is vertical and the x-axis is horizontal, pointing towards the center of the circular track.\n\nThe normal force $\\vec{N}$ is exerted at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical axis (since the track is banked at angle $\\theta$ with respect to the horizontal). Therefore, we can resolve $\\vec{N}$ into its components:\n-   Vertical component: $N_y = N \\cos(\\theta)$\n-   Horizontal component: $N_x = N \\sin(\\theta)$\n\nThe gravitational force $\\vec{F}_g$ acts entirely in the negative y-direction.\n\nNow, we apply Newton's second law, $\\sum \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}$, to both directions.\n\nIn the vertical direction, the train has no acceleration ($a_y = 0$). The upward vertical component of the normal force must balance the downward gravitational force:\n$$\\sum F_y = N \\cos(\\theta) - mg = 0$$\nFrom this, we can express the magnitude of the normal force:\n$$N = \\frac{mg}{\\cos(\\theta)}$$\n\nIn the horizontal direction, the train is undergoing uniform circular motion. The net force provides the required centripetal force, $F_c = ma_c$, where the centripetal acceleration is $a_c = \\frac{v^2}{R}$. The only horizontal force is the horizontal component of the normal force, $N \\sin(\\theta)$.\n$$\\sum F_x = N \\sin(\\theta) = m \\frac{v^2}{R}$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations. We can substitute the expression for $N$ from the vertical force balance into the horizontal force equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{mg}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\right) \\sin(\\theta) = m \\frac{v^2}{R}$$\nThe mass $m$ of the train cancels out from both sides:\n$$g \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)} = \\frac{v^2}{R}$$\nUsing the identity $\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}$, we get:\n$$g \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{v^2}{R}$$\nNow, we can solve for the speed $v$:\n$$v^2 = g R \\tan(\\theta)$$\n$$v = \\sqrt{g R \\tan(\\theta)}$$\n\nFinally, we can find the period $T$ by substituting this expression for $v$ into our initial equation for the period:\n$$T = \\frac{2\\pi R}{v} = \\frac{2\\pi R}{\\sqrt{g R \\tan(\\theta)}}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can bring the $R$ in the numerator inside the square root:\n$$T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{R^2}{g R \\tan(\\theta)}}$$\n$$T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{R}{g \\tan(\\theta)}}$$\nThis is the final expression for the period of the train's revolution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{R}{g \\tan(\\theta)}}}$$", "id": "2206961"}, {"introduction": "Shifting our focus from forces to pure kinematics, this problem explores the concept of relative motion in a circle.
