However, a steady, uniform wind is blowing across the tundra with a constant velocity of magnitude $v_w = 5.0$ m/s, directed from West to East.\n\nSimultaneously, the research team's ground-based tracking confirms that the arctic fox is running at a constant velocity of magnitude $v_f = 8.0$ m/s, directed due West.\n\nThe drone's onboard camera system is locked onto the fox. Your task is to determine the velocity of the fox as it would be measured by this camera system (i.e., the velocity of the fox relative to the drone). First, calculate the magnitude of this relative velocity. Second, calculate its direction as an angle in degrees, measured south of the due west direction.\n\nProvide your final answers for both the magnitude, in m/s, and the angle, in degrees, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the velocity of the fox relative to the drone, $\\vec{v}_{F/D}$. We are given the velocities of the drone relative to the air, the air relative to the ground (the wind), and the fox relative to the ground. We will use the principles of relative vector addition.\n\nFirst, let's define our reference frames:\n- G: The ground (our inertial reference frame)\n- A: The air\n- D: The drone\n- F: The fox\n\nNext, we establish a coordinate system as specified in the problem: let the unit vector $\\hat{i}$ point East (positive x-direction) and the unit vector $\\hat{j}$ point North (positive y-direction).\n\nWe can now express the given velocities as vectors in this coordinate system:\n- The velocity of the fox relative to the ground ($\\vec{v}_{F/G}$) is $v_f = 8.0$ m/s directed due West (negative x-direction). So, $\\vec{v}_{F/G} = -v_f \\hat{i} = -8.0 \\hat{i}$ m/s.\n- The velocity of the drone relative to the air ($\\vec{v}_{D/A}$) is $v_d = 12.0$ m/s directed due North (positive y-direction). So, $\\vec{v}_{D/A} = v_d \\hat{j} = 12.0 \\hat{j}$ m/s.\n- The velocity of the air relative to the ground ($\\vec{v}_{A/G}$), which is the wind, is $v_w = 5.0$ m/s directed from West to East (positive x-direction). So, $\\vec{v}_{A/G} = v_w \\hat{i} = 5.0 \\hat{i}$ m/s.\n\nOur goal is to find the velocity of the fox relative to the drone, $\\vec{v}_{F/D}$. The general formula for relative velocities is $\\vec{v}_{A/B} = \\vec{v}_{A/C} + \\vec{v}_{C/B}$. We can write $\\vec{v}_{F/D}$ by connecting through the ground frame, G:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{F/D} = \\vec{v}_{F/G} + \\vec{v}_{G/D} $$\nWe know that the velocity of the ground relative to the drone is the negative of the velocity of the drone relative to the ground: $\\vec{v}_{G/D} = -\\vec{v}_{D/G}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{F/D} = \\vec{v}_{F/G} - \\vec{v}_{D/G} $$\nWe have $\\vec{v}_{F/G}$, but we need to find $\\vec{v}_{D/G}$, the velocity of the drone relative to the ground. The drone's velocity with respect to the ground is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the air and the air's velocity relative to the ground:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{D/G} = \\vec{v}_{D/A} + \\vec{v}_{A/G} $$\nSubstituting the vector expressions:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{D/G} = (v_d \\hat{j}) + (v_w \\hat{i}) = v_w \\hat{i} + v_d \\hat{j} $$\nNow we can substitute this expression for $\\vec{v}_{D/G}$ back into our equation for $\\vec{v}_{F/D}$:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{F/D} = \\vec{v}_{F/G} - \\vec{v}_{D/G} = (-v_f \\hat{i}) - (v_w \\hat{i} + v_d \\hat{j}) $$\n$$ \\vec{v}_{F/D} = -v_f \\hat{i} - v_w \\hat{i} - v_d \\hat{j} $$\n$$ \\vec{v}_{F/D} = -(v_f + v_w) \\hat{i} - v_d \\hat{j} $$\nNow we plug in the numerical values for the speeds:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{F/D} = -(8.0 + 5.0) \\hat{i} - 12.0 \\hat{j} \\quad \\text{m/s} $$\n$$ \\vec{v}_{F/D} = -13.0 \\hat{i} - 12.0 \\hat{j} \\quad \\text{m/s} $$\nThis is the velocity vector of the fox as measured by the drone.\n\nTo find the magnitude of this velocity, we use the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$ |\\vec{v}_{F/D}| = \\sqrt{(-(v_f+v_w))^2 + (-v_d)^2} = \\sqrt{(v_f+v_w)^2 + v_d^2} $$\n$$ |\\vec{v}_{F/D}| = \\sqrt{(13.0)^2 + (12.0)^2} = \\sqrt{169 + 144} = \\sqrt{313} \\approx 17.6918 \\text{ m/s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the magnitude is $17.7$ m/s.\n\nTo find the direction, we need the angle south of due west. The vector $\\vec{v}_{F/D} = -13.0 \\hat{i} - 12.0 \\hat{j}$ has a negative x-component (West) and a negative y-component (South). The direction \"due west\" corresponds to the negative x-axis. The angle $\\theta$ \"south of due west\" is the angle between the vector and the negative x-axis in the third quadrant. We can find this angle using trigonometry:\n$$ \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{|\\text{y-component}|}{|\\text{x-component}|} = \\frac{|-v_d|}{|-(v_f+v_w)|} = \\frac{v_d}{v_f + v_w} $$\n$$ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{v_d}{v_f + v_w}\\right) $$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$ \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{12.0}{13.0}\\right) \\approx \\arctan(0.92307...)$$\n$$ \\theta \\approx 42.709^{\\circ} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the angle is $42.7$ degrees.\n\nThe final answer consists of the magnitude (17.7 m/s) and the angle (42.7 degrees south of west).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 17.7 & 42.7 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2211080"}, {"introduction": "A crucial application of relative motion is in navigation and collision avoidance, where determining the closest approach of two objects is essential.
