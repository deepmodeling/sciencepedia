By analyzing a simple perpendicular collision, you will see how a single scalar—in this case, related to the coefficient of restitution $e$—can elegantly describe the change in an object's velocity vector, simultaneously accounting for both direction reversal and energy loss. [@problem_id:2213683] This exercise is fundamental for understanding how scalar multiplication is used to model physical transformations.", "problem": "In a materials science laboratory, a new type of polymer sphere is being tested for its elastic properties. The test involves propelling the sphere directly towards a massive, stationary, flat steel wall. The sphere's trajectory is perfectly perpendicular to the surface of the wall upon impact.\n\nLet the initial velocity of the sphere just before impact be denoted by the vector $\\vec{v}_i$. The collision is partially inelastic and is characterized by a single value, the coefficient of restitution $e$. The wall is assumed to be infinitely massive compared to the sphere and remains perfectly stationary during and after the collision. After striking the wall, the sphere rebounds along the same straight-line path it approached on, with a final velocity vector designated as $\\vec{v}_f$.\n\nAssume there is no air resistance and that the sphere does not rotate. Determine the expression for the final velocity vector $\\vec{v}_f$ in terms of the initial velocity vector $\\vec{v}_i$ and the coefficient of restitution $e$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we will analyze the one-dimensional collision using the definition of the coefficient of restitution. Let's establish a one-dimensional coordinate system with the x-axis along the path of the sphere. We can orient the axis such that the wall is located at the origin ($x=0$) and the sphere approaches from the positive x-axis.\n\nIn this coordinate system, the sphere's initial velocity vector $\\vec{v}_i$ points in the negative x-direction (towards the wall). If the initial speed is $v_{speed} = |\\vec{v}_i|$, then the initial velocity vector can be written as $\\vec{v}_i = -v_{speed} \\hat{i}$, where $\\hat{i}$ is the unit vector along the positive x-axis. The scalar component of the initial velocity along the x-axis is therefore $v_{1,i} = -v_{speed}$.\n\nAfter the collision, the sphere rebounds and moves in the positive x-direction (away from the wall). Its final velocity vector $\\vec{v}_f$ will therefore point in the positive x-direction. If the final speed is $v'_{speed} = |\\vec{v}_f|$, the final velocity vector is $\\vec{v}_f = v'_{speed} \\hat{i}$. The scalar component of the final velocity is $v_{1,f} = v'_{speed}$.\n\nThe coefficient of restitution, $e$, for a one-dimensional collision is defined by the formula:\n$$e = \\frac{v_{2,f} - v_{1,f}}{v_{1,i} - v_{2,i}}$$\nwhere subscript 1 refers to the sphere and subscript 2 refers to the wall. The terms $v_{1,i}$ and $v_{1,f}$ are the initial and final scalar velocities of the sphere, and $v_{2,i}$ and $v_{2,f}$ are the initial and final scalar velocities of the wall.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the wall is stationary at all times. Thus, its initial and final velocities are zero:\n$$v_{2,i} = 0$$\n$$v_{2,f} = 0$$\nSubstituting these values, along with the scalar velocities for the sphere, into the definition of the coefficient of restitution gives:\n$$e = \\frac{0 - v_{1,f}}{v_{1,i} - 0} = -\\frac{v_{1,f}}{v_{1,i}}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the final scalar velocity of the sphere in terms of its initial scalar velocity:\n$$v_{1,f} = -e v_{1,i}$$\nNow, we must translate this scalar relationship back into a vector equation. We know the initial and final velocity vectors are given by $\\vec{v}_i = v_{1,i} \\hat{i}$ and $\\vec{v}_f = v_{1,f} \\hat{i}$, respectively.\n\nLet's substitute the expression for $v_{1,f}$ into the equation for the final velocity vector $\\vec{v}_f$:\n$$\\vec{v}_f = (v_{1,f}) \\hat{i} = (-e v_{1,i}) \\hat{i}$$\nWe can factor out the scalar quantity $-e$:\n$$\\vec{v}_f = -e (v_{1,i} \\hat{i})$$\nBy definition, the term in the parentheses, $(v_{1,i} \\hat{i})$, is simply the initial velocity vector $\\vec{v}_i$. Therefore, we arrive at the final expression:\n$$\\vec{v}_f = -e \\vec{v}_i$$\nThis result shows that the final velocity vector is a scalar multiple of the initial velocity vector. The scalar multiplier is $-e$, which correctly indicates that the direction of motion is reversed (due to the negative sign) and the speed is reduced by a factor of $e$ (since $|\\vec{v}_f| = |-e||\\vec{v}_i| = e|\\vec{v}_i|$, and $0 \\le e \\le 1$ for such collisions). The result is independent of the specific choice of the coordinate system's orientation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-e \\vec{v}_i}$$", "id": "2213683"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, this problem explores how scalar multiplication interacts with other fundamental vector operations, specifically the cross product.
