However, in numerous real-world applications, force is not constant but depends on other physical quantities like position or velocity. This practice problem [@problem_id:2222474] explores a dynamic scenario where an object is pulled by a motor delivering constant power $P$, which implies the applied force is inversely proportional to the object's speed, $F = P/v$. This exercise provides an excellent opportunity to apply Newton's second law to a system with non-constant acceleration and to investigate the concept of a limiting or \"terminal\" velocity that arises from this interplay between force and motion.", "problem": "A block of mass $m$ is initially at rest at the bottom of a long, frictionless ramp inclined at an angle $\\theta$ to the horizontal. A motor-driven winch begins to pull the block up the ramp via a light, inextensible cable running parallel to the ramp's surface. The motor supplies a constant power $P$ to the block throughout its motion. As a result, the block's speed $v$ increases from rest. Let $g$ denote the magnitude of the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe pulling force exerted by the cable on the block is not constant. Therefore, the block's acceleration is also not constant. It can be shown that as time progresses, the block's speed approaches a constant limiting value, $v_{\\text{term}}$. Find the magnitude of the block's acceleration at the moment its speed is exactly half of this terminal speed, i.e., when $v = \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\text{term}}$.", "solution": "Let's analyze the forces acting on the block and apply Newton's second law. The forces acting on the block parallel to the inclined ramp are the tension from the cable, $T$, pulling it upwards, and the component of gravity pulling it downwards, $F_{g,\\parallel}$. The motion is along the ramp, so we consider the components of forces in this direction.\n\nThe component of the gravitational force parallel to the incline is given by $F_{g,\\parallel} = mg\\sin(\\theta)$.\nAccording to Newton's second law, the net force on the block in the direction parallel to the ramp is equal to its mass times its acceleration, $a$:\n$$F_{\\text{net}} = T - mg\\sin(\\theta) = ma$$\n\nThe motor delivers a constant power $P$. Power is the rate at which work is done, which for a force $T$ acting on an object moving with velocity $v$ is given by $P = T v$. From this relationship, we can express the tension $T$ as a function of the block's speed $v$:\n$$T(v) = \\frac{P}{v}$$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for the tension back into the equation from Newton's second law:\n$$\\frac{P}{v} - mg\\sin(\\theta) = ma$$\n\nThis equation gives the acceleration $a$ as a function of the speed $v$:\n$$a(v) = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\frac{P}{v} - mg\\sin(\\theta) \\right)$$\nThis confirms that the acceleration is not constant.\n\nNext, we determine the terminal speed, $v_{\\text{term}}$. The terminal speed is the constant speed reached when the acceleration becomes zero ($a=0$). This occurs when the pulling force from the winch perfectly balances the component of gravity along the incline. Setting $a=0$ in our acceleration equation:\n$$0 = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\frac{P}{v_{\\text{term}}} - mg\\sin(\\theta) \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{P}{v_{\\text{term}}} = mg\\sin(\\theta)$$\nSolving for $v_{\\text{term}}$, we get:\n$$v_{\\text{term}} = \\frac{P}{mg\\sin(\\theta)}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the acceleration when the speed $v$ is half of this terminal speed. Let's call this speed $v'$.\n$$v' = \\frac{1}{2}v_{\\text{term}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{P}{mg\\sin(\\theta)} \\right)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this speed $v'$ back into our general expression for acceleration $a(v)$:\n$$a(v') = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\frac{P}{v'} - mg\\sin(\\theta) \\right)$$\n$$a = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( \\frac{P}{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{P}{mg\\sin(\\theta)} \\right)} - mg\\sin(\\theta) \\right)$$\nLet's simplify the first term inside the parenthesis:\n$$\\frac{P}{\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{P}{mg\\sin(\\theta)} \\right)} = P \\cdot \\frac{2mg\\sin(\\theta)}{P} = 2mg\\sin(\\theta)$$\nNow, substitute this simplified term back into the equation for acceleration:\n$$a = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( 2mg\\sin(\\theta) - mg\\sin(\\theta) \\right)$$\n$$a = \\frac{1}{m} \\left( mg\\sin(\\theta) \\right)$$\n$$a = g\\sin(\\theta)$$\n\nThus, the acceleration of the block at the instant its speed is half its terminal speed is $g\\sin(\\theta)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{g\\sin(\\theta)}$$", "id": "2222474"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the theme of variable forces, we now shift our perspective from a purely force-based analysis to an energy-based one.
