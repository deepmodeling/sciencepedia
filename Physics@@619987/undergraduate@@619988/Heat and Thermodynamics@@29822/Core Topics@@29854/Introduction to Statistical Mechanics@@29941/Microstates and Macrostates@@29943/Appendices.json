This first exercise provides practice in this essential task by asking you to enumerate the possible arrangements, or microstates, for a simple quantum system. This problem highlights the crucial roles of particle distinguishability and energy level degeneracy, two concepts that are foundational to accurately describing microscopic states [@problem_id:1877483].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a quantum system consisting of two distinguishable particles, labeled Particle 1 and Particle 2. The single-particle energy spectrum for each particle has two accessible levels. The ground state is non-degenerate, with a single quantum state of energy $E_0=0$. The first excited state is triply degenerate, consisting of three distinct quantum states that all share the same energy $E_1 = \\epsilon$. The system of two particles is prepared in a macrostate with a fixed total energy of exactly $E_{\\text{total}} = \\epsilon$.\n\nCalculate the total number of distinct microstates available to this two-particle system.", "solution": "We consider two distinguishable particles, each with a single-particle spectrum consisting of a non-degenerate ground state at energy $E_{0}=0$ and a triply degenerate first excited state at energy $E_{1}=\\epsilon$. Let the degeneracy of the ground state be $g_{0}=1$ and that of the excited state be $g_{1}=3$.\n\nThe total energy of the two-particle system is fixed at $E_{\\text{total}}=\\epsilon$. The only way to obtain this total energy is for exactly one particle to occupy an excited state (energy $\\epsilon$) and the other particle to occupy the ground state (energy $0$). Configurations where both are in the ground state yield total energy $0$, and configurations where both are excited yield total energy $2\\epsilon$, both of which are excluded.\n\nBecause the particles are distinguishable, we must count separately which particle is excited. There are $2$ choices for which particle is excited. For the excited particle, there are $g_{1}=3$ distinct states available. For the particle in the ground state, there is $g_{0}=1$ state. Therefore, by the multiplication principle, the total number of microstates is\n$$\nN=2\\times g_{1}\\times g_{0}=2\\times 3\\times 1=6.\n$$\nHence, the total number of distinct microstates available to the system is $6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "1877483"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics of counting, we now explore the connection between microscopic arrangements and macroscopic observations. Using the familiar and intuitive analogy of rolling dice, this problem challenges you to compare the number of microstates corresponding to two different macrostates.
