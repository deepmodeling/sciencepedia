An Einstein solid is a collection of identical, independent quantum harmonic oscillators. The total energy of a solid with $N$ oscillators is quantized and given by $U=q\\epsilon$, where $q$ is a non-negative integer representing the number of energy quanta and $\\epsilon$ is the fundamental energy quantum. The multiplicity of a microstate (the number of ways to distribute $q$ quanta among $N$ oscillators) is given by the formula $\\Omega(N, q) = \\binom{q+N-1}{q}$.\n\nLet's denote the two clusters as Cluster A and Cluster B.

Each site $(i,j)$ of the lattice has a spin $s_{i,j}$ that can be either \"up\" ($+1$) or \"down\" ($-1$). The energy of a spin configuration is given by the Hamiltonian:\n$$H = -J \\sum_{\\langle k,l \\rangle} s_k s_l$$\nwhere $J$ is a positive ferromagnetic coupling constant, $s_k$ denotes the spin at a site $k$, and the sum runs over all unique nearest-neighbor pairs of sites on the lattice. The lattice has periodic boundary conditions, meaning the right edge connects to the left edge, and the top edge connects to the bottom edge, forming a torus.\n\nInitially, the system is in its ground state, where all 9 spins are aligned in the \"up\" direction ($s_{i,j} = +1$ for all $i,j$).

The solution requires calculating the change in energy, $\\Delta E$, resulting from the flip and then using the given Metropolis criterion.\n\nFirst, let's identify the initial and final configurations. The initial state is the ground state, where all 9 spins are up: $s_k = +1$ for all sites $k$. The proposed move is to flip the central spin, $s_{2,2}$, from $+1$ to $-1$. So, in the final state, $s_{2,2} = -1$, and all other 8 spins remain $+1$.\n\nThe change in energy, $\\Delta E$, can be calculated by considering only the interactions involving the flipped spin. The energy of a spin $s_k$ due to its neighbors is $E_k = -J s_k \\sum_{j \\in \\text{neigh}(k)} s_j$. When the spin $s_k$ is flipped to $s'_k = -s_k$, the new energy is $E'_k = -J s'_k \\sum_{j \\in \\text{neigh}(k)} s_j = -J(-s_k) \\sum_{j \\in \\text{neigh}(k)} s_j = -E_k$.

On a 3x3 lattice, the central site has four nearest neighbors: $(1,2)$, $(3,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(2,3)$. The periodic boundary conditions do not alter the neighborhood of the central spin.\nIn the initial configuration, all spins are $+1$. Thus, the value of the central spin before the flip is $s_{2,2} = +1$. The values of its four neighbors are also all $+1$.\n\nNow we can calculate the sum of the neighbor spins:\n$$\\sum_{j \\in \\text{neigh}(2,2)} s_j = s_{1,2} + s_{3,2} + s_{2,1} + s_{2,3} = (+1) + (+1) + (+1) + (+1) = 4$$\n\nUsing the formula for $\\Delta E$, we find the energy change:\n$$\\Delta E = 2J s_{2,2} \\left(\\sum_{j \\in \\text{neigh}(2,2)} s_j\\right) = 2J (+1) (4) = 8J$$\nThe energy change is positive, meaning the move is energetically unfavorable, which makes sense as we are disturbing the low-energy ground state.\n\nNext, we use the Metropolis criterion to find the acceptance probability, $P_{\\text{acc}}$.
