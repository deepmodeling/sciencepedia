The gas is composed of $n$ moles of identical diatomic molecules. The motion of all atoms is strictly confined to this plane. The molecules can translate freely across the surface and rotate. The temperature is in a range where the molecules behave as rigid rotors, meaning their bond length is fixed and vibrational modes are not excited. This gas is contained within a region of variable area $A$ and exerts a two-dimensional pressure $\\Pi$ (defined as force per unit length) on the boundary of this region. Determine the molar heat capacity of this gas at constant area, $C_{A,m}$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the universal gas constant $R$.", "solution": "The solution to this problem involves applying the first law of thermodynamics to a two-dimensional system and using the equipartition of energy theorem to determine the internal energy of the gas.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy $dU$ of a system is related to the heat added to the system $dQ$ and the work done by the system $dW$ by the equation:\n$$dU = dQ - dW$$\nFor a standard three-dimensional gas, the work done is $dW = P dV$, where $P$ is pressure and $V$ is volume. For this two-dimensional system, the work is done by expanding the area $A$ against a two-dimensional pressure $\\Pi$. Thus, the work done by the gas is given by:\n$$dW = \\Pi dA$$\nSubstituting this into the first law gives:\n$$dU = dQ - \\Pi dA$$\nThe heat capacity at constant area, $C_A$, is defined as the rate of change of heat with respect to temperature, while keeping the area constant:\n$$C_A = \\left(\\frac{dQ}{dT}\\right)_A$$\nBy rearranging the first law for $dQ$, we get $dQ = dU + \\Pi dA$. Substituting this into the definition of $C_A$:\n$$C_A = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U + \\Pi \\partial A}{\\partial T}\\right)_A = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_A + \\Pi\\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T}\\right)_A$$\nSince the area $A$ is held constant, the term $\\left(\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial T}\\right)_A$ is zero. Therefore, the heat capacity at constant area is directly related to the change in internal energy with temperature:\n$$C_A = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_A$$\nFor an ideal gas, the internal energy $U$ is a function of temperature only. So, the partial derivative becomes a total derivative: $C_A = \\frac{dU}{dT}$.\n\nNext, we determine the internal energy $U$ of the gas using the equipartition of energy theorem. This theorem states that, for a system in thermal equilibrium, each quadratic degree of freedom contributes an average energy of $\\frac{1}{2}k_B T$ per particle, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nWe must count the number of degrees of freedom ($f$) for a single diatomic molecule whose motion is confined to a two-dimensional plane.\n1.  **Translational Degrees of Freedom ($f_{trans}$)**: The center of mass of the molecule can move freely in two independent directions on the plane (e.g., x and y). Therefore, there are $f_{trans} = 2$ translational degrees of freedom.\n2.  **Rotational Degrees of Freedom ($f_{rot}$)**: The molecule is diatomic and rigid. In a 3D space, it would have two rotational degrees of freedom. However, in this 2D system, the atoms are confined to the plane.\n    *   Rotation about the axis connecting the two atoms has a negligible moment of inertia, so it does not contribute a degree of freedom.\n    *   Rotation about any axis lying *within* the plane would cause the atoms to move out of the plane, which is forbidden by the problem's constraints.\n    *   The only possible rotation is about an axis perpendicular to the plane and passing through the molecule's center of mass. This constitutes a single rotational degree of freedom. Therefore, $f_{rot} = 1$.\n3.  **Vibrational Degrees of Freedom ($f_{vib}$)**: The problem states that vibrational modes are not excited, so they do not contribute to the internal energy. Thus, $f_{vib} = 0$.\n\nThe total number of degrees of freedom per molecule is $f = f_{trans} + f_{rot} + f_{vib} = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3$.\n\nAccording to the equipartition theorem, the average energy of a single molecule is:\n$$U_{molecule} = f \\times \\frac{1}{2}k_B T = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T$$\nThe total internal energy $U$ for $n$ moles of the gas is the energy per molecule multiplied by the total number of molecules, $N = n N_A$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number.\n$$U = (n N_A) U_{molecule} = n N_A \\left(\\frac{3}{2} k_B T\\right)$$\nUsing the relationship between the universal gas constant $R$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$, $R = N_A k_B$, we can write the total internal energy as:\n$$U = \\frac{3}{2} n R T$$\nNow we can calculate the heat capacity at constant area, $C_A$:\n$$C_A = \\frac{dU}{dT} = \\frac{d}{dT}\\left(\\frac{3}{2} n R T\\right) = \\frac{3}{2} n R$$\nThe problem asks for the molar heat capacity at constant area, $C_{A,m}$, which is the heat capacity per mole:\n$$C_{A,m} = \\frac{C_A}{n} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} n R}{n}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$C_{A,m} = \\frac{3}{2} R$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}R}$$", "id": "1860371"}]}
