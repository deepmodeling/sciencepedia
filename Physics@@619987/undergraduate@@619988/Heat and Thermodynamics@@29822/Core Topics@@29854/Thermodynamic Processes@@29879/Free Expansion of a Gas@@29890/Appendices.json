The gas is initially in equilibrium at a pressure $P_i$ and temperature $T_i$. A micrometeoroid unexpectedly punctures this container, allowing the gas to escape and undergo a free expansion, rapidly filling a much larger, pre-evacuated, rigid, and thermally insulated instrument chamber that encloses the original container.
