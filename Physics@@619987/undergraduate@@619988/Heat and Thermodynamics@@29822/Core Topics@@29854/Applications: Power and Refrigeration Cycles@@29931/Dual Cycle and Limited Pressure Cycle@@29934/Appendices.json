In this cycle, a fixed amount of an ideal gas, with a constant ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$, is subjected to a series of processes. The cycle begins at state 1 with pressure $P_1$. The gas is first isentropically compressed to a fraction of its initial volume, characterized by the compression ratio $r = V_1/V_2$, where $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the volumes at the beginning and end of the compression stroke, respectively. Following this, heat is added in two stages: first at a constant volume (from state 2 to state 3), and then at a constant pressure (from state 3 to state 4). The pressure increase during the constant volume heat addition is defined by the pressure ratio $\\alpha = P_3/P_2$. The cycle is completed by an isentropic expansion and a constant volume heat rejection process that returns the gas to its initial state.\n\nDetermine the maximum pressure, $P_{max}$, achieved during this dual combustion cycle.
