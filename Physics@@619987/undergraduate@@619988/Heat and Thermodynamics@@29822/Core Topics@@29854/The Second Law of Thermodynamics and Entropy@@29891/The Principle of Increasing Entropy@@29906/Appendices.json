Express your answer in terms of $m$, $c$, $v$, and $T_i$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total entropy change of the system, which consists of two lumps of clay, due to an inelastic collision. The system is isolated, meaning there is no exchange of mass or energy with the surroundings. The entropy change will be a consequence of the irreversible process of the collision.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the mechanics of the collision to determine the energy dissipated as heat. The collision is perfectly inelastic. Let the two lumps of clay be moving in opposite directions along the x-axis. Their initial velocities can be written as $\\vec{v}_1 = v\\hat{i}$ and $\\vec{v}_2 = -v\\hat{i}$.\n\nThe total initial kinetic energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energies of the two lumps:\n$$K_i = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 = m v^2$$\n\nSince the collision is perfectly inelastic, the two lumps stick together. By conservation of linear momentum, the final velocity of the combined lump can be found. The initial total momentum is:\n$$P_i = m\\vec{v}_1 + m\\vec{v}_2 = m(v\\hat{i}) + m(-v\\hat{i}) = 0$$\n\nThe final mass of the combined lump is $M_{final} = m + m = 2m$. Let its final velocity be $\\vec{v}_f$. The final momentum is:\n$$P_f = (2m)\\vec{v}_f$$\n\nBy conservation of momentum, $P_f = P_i$, which implies:\n$$(2m)\\vec{v}_f = 0 \\implies \\vec{v}_f = 0$$\nThe combined lump is at rest after the collision.\n\nThe final kinetic energy of the system is therefore zero:\n$$K_f = \\frac{1}{2}(2m)(0)^2 = 0$$\n\nThe \"lost\" kinetic energy is the difference between the initial and final kinetic energies:\n$$\\Delta K = K_f - K_i = 0 - mv^2 = -mv^2$$\n\nSince the system is isolated, this lost mechanical energy is not lost from the system but is converted into internal thermal energy. This thermal energy, which we'll denote as $Q$, heats the combined lump of clay.\n$$Q = |\\Delta K| = m v^2$$\n\nThis heat $Q$ raises the temperature of the combined mass of clay, $2m$, from its initial temperature $T_i$ to a final equilibrium temperature $T_f$. The relationship between heat added and temperature change is given by $Q = (\\text{mass}) \\times (\\text{specific heat}) \\times (\\Delta T)$.\n$$Q = (2m) c (T_f - T_i)$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $Q$:\n$$m v^2 = 2mc(T_f - T_i)$$\nWe can solve for the final temperature $T_f$:\n$$\\frac{v^2}{2c} = T_f - T_i$$\n$$T_f = T_i + \\frac{v^2}{2c}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the change in entropy, $\\Delta S$. For a system whose temperature changes from $T_i$ to $T_f$ due to the addition of heat, the entropy change is calculated by integrating $dQ/T$:\n$$\\Delta S = \\int \\frac{dQ}{T}$$\nFor a substance with mass $M_{final} = 2m$ and constant specific heat capacity $c$, the infinitesimal heat added is $dQ = (2m)c\\,dT$. Integrating from the initial temperature $T_i$ to the final temperature $T_f$:\n$$\\Delta S = \\int_{T_i}^{T_f} \\frac{(2m)c}{T} dT$$\n$$\\Delta S = 2mc \\int_{T_i}^{T_f} \\frac{1}{T} dT = 2mc [\\ln(T)]_{T_i}^{T_f}$$\n$$\\Delta S = 2mc (\\ln(T_f) - \\ln(T_i)) = 2mc \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_f}{T_i}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, substitute the expression for $T_f$ we derived earlier:\n$$\\Delta S = 2mc \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_i + \\frac{v^2}{2c}}{T_i}\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying the term inside the logarithm gives the final expression for the entropy change:\n$$\\Delta S = 2mc \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{v^2}{2cT_i}\\right)$$\nSince $v^2 > 0$, the argument of the logarithm is greater than 1, so $\\ln(...) > 0$, and thus $\\Delta S > 0$.
