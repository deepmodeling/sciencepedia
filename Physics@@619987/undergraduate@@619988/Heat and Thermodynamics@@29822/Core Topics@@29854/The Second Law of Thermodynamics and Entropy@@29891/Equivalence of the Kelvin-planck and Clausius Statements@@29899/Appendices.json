This first exercise demonstrates one direction of this equivalence: if a device could violate the Clausius statement, it could be used to build another device that violates the Kelvin-Planck statement. By combining a hypothetical \"perfect\" refrigerator with a standard Carnot engine, you will calculate the net work output and prove that a Clausius violation inevitably leads to the creation of a so-called \"perpetual motion machine of the second kind.\" [@problem_id:1860619]", "problem": "An inventor proposes a novel composite heat engine system operating between a hot thermal reservoir at temperature $T_H$ and a cold thermal reservoir at temperature $T_C$, where $T_H > T_C$. The system consists of two main components that operate in cycles.\n\nThe first component is a hypothetical refrigerator that is claimed to violate the Clausius statement of the second law of thermodynamics. In each cycle, this refrigerator extracts an amount of heat $Q_C$ from the cold reservoir and transfers it to the hot reservoir, allegedly without requiring any external work input.\n\nThe second component is a standard, reversible Carnot engine that operates between the same two thermal reservoirs.

We will analyze each component and then combine them to find the net effect. We adopt the sign convention where heat absorbed by a system and work done by a system are positive.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the hypothetical refrigerator. It violates the Clausius statement, which means it can transfer heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir with no work input.\nLet $W_{ref}$ be the work done ON the refrigerator. The problem states this is zero, so $W_{ref}=0$.\nThe refrigerator extracts heat $Q_C$ from the cold reservoir at temperature $T_C$. So, the heat absorbed from the cold source is $Q_{C,ref} = Q_C$.\nLet $Q_{H,ref}$ be the heat rejected to the hot reservoir at temperature $T_H$. According to the first law of thermodynamics applied to the refrigerator over one cycle, the change in internal energy is zero, so the net heat transfer must equal the work done on the system.\n$\\Delta U_{ref} = (Q_{C,ref} - Q_{H,ref}) = -W_{ref}$.\nSubstituting the known values:\n$Q_C - Q_{H,ref} = -0 = 0$\nThis implies $Q_{H,ref} = Q_C$.\nSo, the Clausius-violating refrigerator absorbs heat $Q_C$ from the cold reservoir and rejects an equal amount of heat $Q_C$ to the hot reservoir. The net work interaction for this component is zero.\n\nNext, let's analyze the standard reversible Carnot engine.\nLet $W_{eng}$ be the work done BY the engine.\nThe engine rejects heat $Q_{C,eng} = Q_C$ to the cold reservoir at $T_C$.\nLet $Q_{H,eng}$ be the heat the engine absorbs from the hot reservoir at $T_H$.\nFor a reversible Carnot cycle, the ratio of heat transfers is equal to the ratio of the absolute temperatures of the reservoirs:\n$$ \\frac{Q_{H,eng}}{T_H} = \\frac{Q_{C,eng}}{T_C} $$\nSubstituting $Q_{C,eng} = Q_C$, we can find the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir:\n$$ Q_{H,eng} = Q_C \\frac{T_H}{T_C} $$\nThe work done BY the Carnot engine in one cycle is given by the first law:\n$$ W_{eng} = Q_{H,eng} - Q_{C,eng} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the heat transfers:\n$$ W_{eng} = Q_C \\frac{T_H}{T_C} - Q_C = Q_C \\left( \\frac{T_H}{T_C} - 1 \\right) $$\n\nNow, we analyze the composite system by summing the work and heat interactions of its two components.\nThe net work done BY the composite system, $W_{net}$, is the sum of the work done by the engine and the work done by the refrigerator (noting that $W_{ref}$ was work done ON the device, so work BY the device is $-W_{ref}=0$).\n$$ W_{net} = W_{eng} + (-W_{ref}) = W_{eng} + 0 = W_{eng} $$\nTherefore, the net work is:\n$$ W_{net} = Q_C \\left( \\frac{T_H}{T_C} - 1 \\right) $$\n\nTo fully understand the system, let's examine the net heat exchange with each reservoir.\nNet heat exchange with the cold reservoir ($T_C$):\nThe refrigerator absorbs $Q_C$. The engine rejects $Q_C$.\n$Q_{net, C} = Q_{C,ref} - Q_{C,eng} = Q_C - Q_C = 0$.\nThere is no net heat exchange with the cold reservoir.\n\nNet heat exchange with the hot reservoir ($T_H$):\nThe engine absorbs $Q_{H,eng}$. The refrigerator rejects $Q_{H,ref} = Q_C$.\n$Q_{net, H} = Q_{H,eng} - Q_{H,ref} = \\left(Q_C \\frac{T_H}{T_C}\\right) - Q_C = Q_C \\left(\\frac{T_H}{T_C} - 1\\right)$.\n\nWe see that $W_{net} = Q_{net, H}$. The composite system operates in a cycle, absorbs a net amount of heat $Q_{net,H}$ from a single reservoir (the hot one), and converts it completely into work, with no other thermal effects. This constitutes a violation of the Kelvin-Planck statement. The calculation confirms that a violation of the Clausius statement leads to a violation of the Kelvin-Planck statement.\n\nThe question asks for the net work done by the system, which we have calculated. We can write the expression in a slightly different form:\n$$ W_{net} = Q_C \\left( \\frac{T_H - T_C}{T_C} \\right) $$\nSince $T_H > T_C$, the net work $W_{net}$ is positive.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{Q_C \\left(\\frac{T_H - T_C}{T_C}\\right)}$$", "id": "1860619"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's explore the equivalence from the opposite direction.
