According to their press release, a prototype of their engine operates in a complete thermodynamic cycle and performs an amount of net work, $W$. In each cycle, the engine is claimed to absorb an amount of heat $Q_H = 125 \\text{ kJ}$ from a single high-temperature thermal reservoir maintained at a constant temperature $T_H = 1100 \\text{ K}$. The company's key claim is that the engine produces an amount of net work $W$ that is exactly equal to the heat absorbed, i.e., $W = 125 \\text{ kJ}$, thus achieving perfect energy conversion.\n\nAs a thermodynamic consultant, you are asked to evaluate this claim. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental reason to be skeptical of this claim, based on the laws of thermodynamics?\n\nA. The claim is invalid because it violates the First Law of Thermodynamics, which dictates that energy cannot be created or destroyed.\n\nB. The claim is invalid because it violates the Kelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.\n\nC. The claim is invalid because no heat engine can be more efficient than a Carnot engine, and a Carnot engine operating with a hot reservoir at $1100 \\text{ K}$ cannot have 100% efficiency.\n\nD. The claim could be valid if the engine operates in a perfectly reversible manner.\n\nE. The claim is invalid because the temperature of the hot reservoir, $T_H = 1100 \\text{ K}$, is not high enough to achieve such performance.", "solution": "For any cyclic engine, the First Law of Thermodynamics (energy conservation) gives the cycle energy balance\n$$\nW_{\\text{net}}=Q_{\\text{in}}-Q_{\\text{out}}.\n$$\nWhen there is a single hot reservoir supplying heat $Q_{H}$ and any rejected heat is $Q_{C}$, this reads\n$$\nW=Q_{H}-Q_{C}.\n$$\nThe claim $W=Q_{H}$ implies $Q_{C}=0$. This does not violate the First Law, because the energy balance is satisfied with $\\Delta U=0$ over a cycle and $W=Q_{H}$.

The Kelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law asserts that it is impossible to construct a device that operates in a cycle whose sole effect is to extract heat from a single thermal reservoir and deliver an equivalent amount of work.

Option D is false because reversibility cannot yield $\\eta=1$ unless $T_{C}=0$, which is unattainable. Option E is false because no finite value of $T_{H}$ alone permits $\\eta=1$; the prohibition is not about $T_{H}$ being “high enough” but about the Second Law constraint.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1896355"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond conventional engines, this thought experiment challenges you to apply thermodynamic principles to a more abstract scenario. By analyzing a hypothetical perpetual bouncing ball, you will learn to identify the key components of a cyclic process—a single heat reservoir and the complete conversion of its heat into work—in a non-traditional context [@problem_id:1896311]. This skill is crucial for recognizing the far-reaching implications of the second law in diverse physical systems.", "problem": "Imagine a hypothetical device called the \"Aether-Ball\". When a normal ball bounces on the ground, the collision is inelastic, and a portion of its macroscopic kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy, warming the ball and the ground slightly. This causes each successive bounce to be lower than the previous one.\n\nThe Aether-Ball, however, is designed with a special internal mechanism. When the Aether-Ball strikes the ground, it deforms, and the kinetic energy lost is momentarily stored as thermal energy, raising the ball's internal temperature. The internal mechanism then perfectly and completely converts this exact amount of thermal energy back into kinetic energy for the rebound. As a result, the Aether-Ball bounces back to its original height after every bounce, assuming no air resistance.\n\nConsider a complete bounce cycle (from the peak of its trajectory, down to impact, and back up to the same peak height) occurring in an environment where the air and the ground are at a constant, uniform temperature. According to the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics, this perpetual bouncing is impossible. Which of the following statements provides the correct reasoning for this violation?\n\nA. The process is impossible because it represents a device, operating in a cycle, that draws heat from a single thermal reservoir (the temporarily heated ball material) and converts it entirely into work (the kinetic energy of the rebound).\n\nB. The process violates the first law of thermodynamics because the ball returning to the same height implies that energy is being created to counteract the losses during impact.\n\nC. The process violates the Clausius statement of the second law because for the ball to rebound, heat must be flowing from the colder ground into the hotter ball.\n\nD. The process is impossible because creating a perfectly elastic collision would require the entropy of the ball-ground system to decrease, which is forbidden.\n\nE. The process describes a perpetual motion machine of the first kind, which is defined as any device that can do work indefinitely without an energy source.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the correct reason why the Aether-Ball violates the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nFirst, let's state the Kelvin-Planck statement: \"It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the process of the Aether-Ball over one complete cycle. A \"cycle\" for a thermodynamic device means it returns to its initial state. In this case, the ball starts at a certain height $h$, with a specific internal energy (and temperature, equal to the ambient temperature). At the end of the bounce, it returns to the same height $h$ and, because the heat generated was used, it also returns to its initial temperature. Thus, the ball itself is a device operating in a cycle.\n\nLet's break down the energy transformations during the cycle:\n1.  **Falling:** Potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n2.  **Impact:** The macroscopic kinetic energy of the ball is converted into thermal energy due to the deformation of the ball. This raises the temperature of the ball's material, so $T_{ball} > T_{ambient}$. At this moment, the ball's own material acts as a temporary heat reservoir. Let's call the amount of thermal energy generated $Q$.\n3.  **Rebound:** The Aether-Ball's special mechanism engages. It takes the thermal energy $Q$ from the hot material of the ball and converts it *entirely* into work, $W$. This work is done to push the ball off the ground, manifesting as the kinetic energy of the rebound. So, $W = Q$.\n4.  **Rising:** The kinetic energy is converted back into potential energy, and the ball reaches its original height.\n\nNow, let's check this process against the Kelvin-Planck statement:\n-   **Device operating in a cycle:** Yes, the Aether-Ball returns to its initial state (height and temperature).\n-   **Receive heat from a single reservoir:** Yes, the mechanism within the ball extracts heat $Q$ from a single source: the ball's own material, which is temporarily at a temperature higher than the surroundings. This temporarily hot material constitutes a single thermal reservoir.\n-   **Produce a net amount of work:** Yes, the mechanism produces work $W$ (the rebound kinetic energy) such that $W=Q$. This is a complete conversion of heat from a single reservoir into work.\n\nThis perfectly matches the description of a process forbidden by the Kelvin-Planck statement. Therefore, option A is the correct explanation.\n\nLet's examine why the other options are incorrect:\n-   **Option B:** This is incorrect. The process described does not violate the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy). Energy is not created; it is converted from one form to another (potential -> kinetic -> thermal -> kinetic -> potential). The *impossibility* of the process lies not in energy conservation but in the *direction* and *efficiency* of the thermal-to-work conversion, which is governed by the second law.\n-   **Option C:** This is incorrect. The heat is not flowing from the colder ground to the hotter ball. The heat is generated *internally* within the ball due to the inelastic deformation. The mechanism then uses this internal heat. The Clausius statement (\"It is impossible to construct a device which operates in a cycle and produces no other effect than the transfer of heat from a cooler to a hotter body\") is not directly violated here.\n-   **Option D:** While it is true that such a process would lead to a decrease in the universe's total entropy (a more general statement of the second law), this option is less precise than option A. It doesn't specifically invoke the Kelvin-Planck statement, which is about heat engines, cycles, and work. Option A correctly identifies the specific elements of the cycle (single reservoir, complete conversion to work) that map directly onto the Kelvin-Planck formulation of the second law.\n-   **Option E:** This is incorrect. The described device is a perpetual motion machine of the *second* kind, not the first. A perpetual motion machine of the first kind violates the first law of thermodynamics (energy conservation), for example, by producing more energy than it consumes. A perpetual motion machine of the second kind, like the Aether-Ball, is one that would hypothetically violate the second law of thermodynamics by, for instance, converting heat from a single reservoir completely into work. The Aether-Ball does not create energy from nothing; it attempts an impossible energy conversion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1896311"}, {"introduction": "This final practice addresses a common and insightful question that often arises when first learning the second law: its apparent asymmetry. We readily observe work being converted entirely into heat, so why is the reverse forbidden? By dissecting the argument around a simple electric heater, you will uncover the directional nature of the second law and solidify your understanding that it's a law about prohibition, not symmetry [@problem_id:1896313].", "problem": "A physics student is discussing thermodynamics with a friend who is skeptical about the universal applicability of its laws. The friend presents the following argument:\n\n\"The Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics claims it is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work. This essentially forbids a 100% efficient heat engine. However, consider my simple electric space heater. It takes in electrical energy, which is a form of high-grade energy equivalent to work, and converts it into heat that warms the room. This conversion is, for all practical purposes, 100% efficient. If the complete conversion of heat into work is impossible, shouldn't the reverse process—the complete conversion of work into heat—also be restricted by a similar principle of thermodynamic symmetry? The existence of a common device that performs this 'forbidden' reverse process with 100% efficiency seems to represent a fundamental inconsistency in the second law.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental refutation of the friend's argument?\n\nA. The friend is correct. The operation of an electric heater is a direct counterexample to the principles of the second law of thermodynamics, which is an unresolved issue in physics.\n\nB. The electric heater does not violate the law because the conversion is not perfectly 100% efficient; a small amount of energy is always lost as light and sound.\n\nC. The Kelvin-Planck statement applies only to devices operating in a cycle. An electric heater's internal state is constantly changing as it warms up and is therefore not a cyclical device.\n\nD. The second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally asymmetrical. It places a restriction on the conversion of low-grade energy (heat) into high-grade energy (work), but it places no such restriction on the conversion of work into heat.\n\nE. The electrical energy supplied to the heater is not pure work because the electrons carrying the energy have their own thermal motion and entropy, so the premise of the argument is incorrect.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law of thermodynamics: it is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work as its sole effect. The fundamental mathematical statement underlying this is the Clausius inequality for a cyclic process,\n$$\n\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q}{T} \\le 0,\n$$\nwhere the integral is taken over a complete cycle, $\\delta Q$ is the heat transferred into the system, and $T$ is the temperature at the boundary where $\\delta Q$ is transferred.\n\nConsider a hypothetical engine that would violate Kelvin-Planck: it absorbs heat $Q$ from a single reservoir at temperature $T$ and converts it completely into work, with no other heat transfer. Over one cycle this implies $W=Q$ and no heat rejected. The Clausius integral would then be\n$$\n\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q}{T}=\\frac{Q}{T}>0,\n$$\nwhich contradicts the inequality. Hence complete conversion of heat from a single reservoir into work in a cyclic device is forbidden.\n\nNow consider an electric heater. The heater takes in electrical energy, which is high-grade energy and is treated as work in thermodynamics. For steady operation over a time interval long enough that the heater’s state returns to the same condition (or remains stationary), the first law gives an energy balance\n$$\nW_{\\text{in}}=Q_{\\text{out}},\n$$\nwhere $W_{\\text{in}}$ is the electrical work supplied and $Q_{\\text{out}}$ is the heat delivered to the room.\n\nFor the second law, we use the entropy balance. Work transfer carries no entropy. If the room is modeled as a large reservoir at temperature $T$, receiving heat $Q$ from the heater, then the entropy change of the room is\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{room}}=\\frac{Q}{T}>0.\n$$\nOver a steady interval, the heater’s own entropy change is zero, and there is no entropy transfer with the electrical work. Therefore, the total entropy generation is\n$$\n\\sigma=\\Delta S_{\\text{room}} \\ge 0,\n$$\nwhich satisfies the second law. In fact, converting work into heat increases entropy and is therefore fully allowed; there is no restriction analogous to Kelvin-Planck that forbids complete conversion of work into heat.\n\nThis demonstrates the fundamental asymmetry of the second law: it prohibits complete conversion of low-grade energy (heat from a single reservoir) into high-grade energy (work) in a cyclic device because that would reduce total entropy, but it places no restriction on the complete conversion of work into heat, which increases entropy.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false because there is no inconsistency; the heater is entirely consistent with the second law.\n- B is incorrect because perfect or near-perfect conversion of work to heat is not prohibited; small losses are unnecessary to save the second law.\n- C mentions cycles but misses the fundamental reason; even if one considered a steady periodic operation, the key point is the entropy directionality, not merely cyclicity.\n- D correctly states the fundamental asymmetry: restrictions apply to heat-to-work, not work-to-heat.\n- E is incorrect because the electrical energy supplied is appropriately treated as work; electron thermal motion does not negate that.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental refutation is that the second law is asymmetrical in exactly this way.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1896313"}]}
