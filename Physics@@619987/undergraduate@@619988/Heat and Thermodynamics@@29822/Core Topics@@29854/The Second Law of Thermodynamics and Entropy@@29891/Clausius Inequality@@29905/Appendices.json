This exercise puts you in the role of a scientific consultant, tasked with evaluating a device that purports to heat a room using a colder source without any work input. The Clausius inequality provides the definitive tool to test such claims, serving as a rigorous check on whether a proposed thermodynamic cycle is physically possible or merely a violation of the second law [@problem_id:1848856].", "problem": "An engineering startup claims to have designed a novel \"Geothermal Passive Heating Unit\". The device is purported to maintain a room's interior temperature at a constant $25.0^\\circ\\text{C}$ by cyclically extracting heat from a geothermal spring that is at a stable temperature of $15.0^\\circ\\text{C}$. A key feature of their marketing is the claim that this process is achieved without any external work input, meaning the device simply facilitates heat transfer from the colder spring to the warmer room.\n\nAs a consultant, you must evaluate the thermodynamic feasibility of this device. Your analysis should be based on the Clausius inequality. For your calculations, you may assume the room and the spring act as thermal reservoirs, and all temperatures must be converted to Kelvin using the conversion K $= ^\\circ\\text{C} + 273.15$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly assesses the feasibility of the proposed device?\n\nA. The device is feasible because the total energy transfer, considering the heat from the spring and the heat delivered to the room, is conserved.\n\nB.

The device is infeasible because the cyclic integral of $\\frac{\\delta Q}{T}$ for the proposed cycle is positive, which violates the Clausius inequality.\n\nE. The device is infeasible because the cyclic integral of $\\frac{\\delta Q}{T}$ is negative, implying an irreversible process that cannot be sustained without work.", "solution": "Convert the stated reservoir temperatures to Kelvin as required.

Denote by $Q_{C}0$ the heat absorbed by the device from the cold reservoir at $T_{C}$ and by $Q_{H}$ the heat absorbed by the device from the hot reservoir at $T_{H}$. Because the device is claimed to deliver heat to the room, heat flows from the device to the hot reservoir, so the heat absorbed by the device from the hot reservoir is negative: $Q_{H}0$.
