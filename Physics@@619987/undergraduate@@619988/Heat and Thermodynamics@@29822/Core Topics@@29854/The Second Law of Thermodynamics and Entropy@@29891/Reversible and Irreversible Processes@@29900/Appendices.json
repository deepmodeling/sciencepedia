The gas is a monatomic ideal gas.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Process A, the quasi-static adiabatic compression.\nA quasi-static and adiabatic process is, by definition, a reversible and isentropic process, meaning the entropy of the gas remains constant. For an isentropic process involving an ideal gas, the following relation holds between temperature and pressure:\n$$T P^{(1-\\gamma)/\\gamma} = \\text{constant}$$\nwhere $\\gamma = C_P/C_V$ is the heat capacity ratio. For a monatomic ideal gas, the molar heat capacity at constant volume is $C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$ and the molar heat capacity at constant pressure is $C_P = C_V + R = \\frac{5}{2}R$. Thus, the heat capacity ratio is:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2}R}{\\frac{3}{2}R} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\nApplying the isentropic relation between the initial state $(P_i, T_i)$ and the final state $(P_f, T_A)$:\n$$T_i P_i^{(1-\\gamma)/\\gamma} = T_A P_f^{(1-\\gamma)/\\gamma}$$\nWe can solve for the final temperature $T_A$:\n$$T_A = T_i \\left(\\frac{P_i}{P_f}\\right)^{(1-\\gamma)/\\gamma} = T_i \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$$\n\nNext, let's analyze Process B, the rapid, single-step irreversible compression.\nSince the process is adiabatic, the heat exchanged with the surroundings is zero, $Q=0$. According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, the change in internal energy $\\Delta U$ is equal to the work done on the gas, $W$.\n$$\\Delta U = Q + W = W$$\nFor an ideal gas, the change in internal energy depends only on the change in temperature: $\\Delta U = n C_V (T_B - T_i)$, where $n$ is the number of moles of gas.\nThe work done on the gas during a single-step compression against a constant external pressure $P_{ext}$ is given by $W = -P_{ext}(V_f - V_i)$. In this case, the external pressure is suddenly increased to and held constant at $P_{ext} = P_f$. So,\n$$W = -P_f(V_B - V_i)$$\nwhere $V_i$ is the initial volume and $V_B$ is the final volume. Using the ideal gas law, $PV=nRT$, we can express the volumes in terms of temperature and pressure:\n$$V_i = \\frac{nRT_i}{P_i} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad V_B = \\frac{nRT_B}{P_f}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for work:\n$$W = -P_f\\left(\\frac{nRT_B}{P_f} - \\frac{nRT_i}{P_i}\\right) = -nRT_B + nRT_i\\frac{P_f}{P_i}$$\nNow we equate the change in internal energy with the work done:\n$$n C_V (T_B - T_i) = -nRT_B + nRT_i\\frac{P_f}{P_i}$$\nThe number of moles $n$ cancels out from both sides:\n$$C_V (T_B - T_i) = -RT_B + RT_i\\frac{P_f}{P_i}$$\nFor an ideal gas, $C_V = \\frac{R}{\\gamma-1}$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\\frac{R}{\\gamma-1}(T_B - T_i) = -RT_B + RT_i\\frac{P_f}{P_i}$$\nThe gas constant $R$ also cancels out:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\gamma-1}(T_B - T_i) = -T_B + T_i\\frac{P_f}{P_i}$$\nNow, we solve for $T_B$:\n$$T_B - T_i = -(\\gamma-1)T_B + (\\gamma-1)T_i\\frac{P_f}{P_i}$$\n$$T_B + (\\gamma-1)T_B = T_i + (\\gamma-1)T_i\\frac{P_f}{P_i}$$\n$$\\gamma T_B = T_i \\left(1 + (\\gamma-1)\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)$$\n$$T_B = \\frac{T_i}{\\gamma} \\left(1 + (\\gamma-1)\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $T_B/T_A$:\n$$\\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \\frac{\\frac{T_i}{\\gamma} \\left(1 + (\\gamma-1)\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)}{T_i \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}}$$\nThe initial temperature $T_i$ cancels out:\n$$\\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \\frac{1 + (\\gamma-1)\\frac{P_f}{P_i}}{\\gamma \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values. The pressure ratio is $\\frac{P_f}{P_i} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^6~\\text{Pa}}{1.00 \\times 10^5~\\text{Pa}} = 20$.\nFor the monatomic gas, $\\gamma = 5/3$. Therefore, $\\gamma-1 = 2/3$ and $(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma = (2/3)/(5/3) = 2/5 = 0.4$.\nSubstituting these into the ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \\frac{1 + (\\frac{2}{3})(20)}{\\frac{5}{3} (20)^{0.4}}$$\n$$\\frac{T_B}{T_A} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{40}{3}}{\\frac{5}{3} (20)^{0.4}} = \\frac{\\frac{43}{3}}{\\frac{5}{3} (20)^{0.4}} = \\frac{43}{5 \\times (20)^{0.4}}$$\nNow we calculate the numerical value:\n$$(20)^{0.4} \\approx 3.314454$$\n$$\\frac{T_B}{T_A} \\approx \\frac{43}{5 \\times 3.314454} = \\frac{43}{16.57227} \\approx 2.59461$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get 2.59.\nThe irreversible process results in a significantly higher final temperature because more work is done on the gas (and thus converted into internal energy) when compressing against a constant high external pressure compared to the reversible case where the external pressure is increased gradually.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.59}$$", "id": "1889040"}, {"introduction": "The principles of entropy and irreversibility extend far beyond simple gases in pistons, governing processes in chemistry, biology, and engineering.
