We need to find the ratio $\\frac{(dT/dS)_V}{(dT/dS)_P}$, where the subscripts $V$ and $P$ denote constant volume and constant pressure processes, respectively.\n\nWe start from the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a simple compressible system, which combines the first and second laws of thermodynamics for a reversible process:\n$$TdS = dU + P dV$$\nHere, $T$ is temperature, $dS$ is the infinitesimal change in entropy, $dU$ is the infinitesimal change in internal energy, $P$ is pressure, and $dV$ is the infinitesimal change in volume.\n\n**Process 1: Constant Volume (Isochoric) Process**\nFor an isochoric process, the volume is constant, so $dV = 0$. The thermodynamic relation simplifies to:\n$$TdS = dU$$\nFor an ideal gas, the change in internal energy $dU$ is related to the change in temperature $dT$ by the molar heat capacity at constant volume, $C_V$:\n$$dU = n C_V dT$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of moles.\nSubstituting this into the simplified relation, we get:\n$$TdS = n C_V dT$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to find the slope of the isochoric curve on the $T-S$ diagram:\n$$\\left(\\frac{dT}{dS}\\right)_V = \\frac{T}{n C_V}$$\n\n**Process 2: Constant Pressure (Isobaric) Process**\nFor an isobaric process, it is more convenient to use the enthalpy, $H = U + PV$. The differential of enthalpy is:\n$$dH = dU + P dV + V dP$$\nSubstituting the fundamental relation $TdS = dU + P dV$ into the expression for $dH$, we get:\n$$dH = TdS + V dP$$\nFor an isobaric process, the pressure is constant, so $dP = 0$.

The gas, which has a constant adiabatic index $\\gamma > 1$, enters the compressor at an initial state defined by pressure $P_0$ and temperature $T_0$. The compressor must increase the pressure of the gas to a final value $P_f$, where $P_f > P_0$.

The relationship depends on the initial temperature $T_0$; one process requires more work at low temperatures and the other at high temperatures.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we need to compare the work required to compress an ideal gas from an initial pressure $P_0$ to a final pressure $P_f$ along two different reversible paths: isothermal and adiabatic. The problem specifies a steady-flow compressor, which is an open system.\n\nFor a reversible, steady-flow process with negligible changes in kinetic and potential energy, the work done on the system per mole, $W$, is given by the integral of the molar volume $v$ with respect to pressure $P$:\n$$W = \\int_{P_0}^{P_f} v \\, dP$$\nOur goal is to compare $W_{iso} = \\int_{P_0}^{P_f} v_{iso}(P) \\, dP$ and $W_{ad} = \\int_{P_0}^{P_f} v_{ad}(P) \\, dP$. To do this, we must first express the molar volume $v$ as a function of pressure $P$ for each path. Both processes start from the same initial state $(P_0, T_0)$.\n\n**Path A: Reversible Isothermal Compression**\nIn an isothermal process, the temperature is constant at $T = T_0$. Using the ideal gas law, $Pv = RT$, we can express the molar volume as a function of pressure:\n$$v_{iso}(P) = \\frac{RT_0}{P}$$\n\n**Path B: Reversible Adiabatic Compression**\nIn a reversible adiabatic (isentropic) process, the relationship between pressure and volume is given by $Pv^{\\gamma} = \\text{constant}$. We can determine the constant using the initial state $(P_0, v_0)$:\n$$Pv^{\\gamma} = P_0 v_0^{\\gamma}$$\nwhere $v_0$ is the initial molar volume, given by the ideal gas law as $v_0 = RT_0/P_0$.\nSolving for the molar volume $v$ as a function of pressure $P$:\n$$v_{ad}(P) = \\left(\\frac{P_0 v_0^{\\gamma}}{P}\\right)^{1/\\gamma} = v_0 \\left(\\frac{P_0}{P}\\right)^{1/\\gamma}$$\n\n**Comparison of Molar Volumes**\nNow we compare the molar volumes $v_{iso}(P)$ and $v_{ad}(P)$ for any pressure $P$ within the integration range, i.e., for $P_0  P \\leq P_f$.\nThe isothermal volume is $v_{iso}(P) = RT_0/P$. Since $RT_0 = P_0 v_0$, we can write this as $v_{iso}(P) = P_0v_0/P = v_0(P_0/P)$.\nThe adiabatic volume is $v_{ad}(P) = v_0 (P_0/P)^{1/\\gamma}$.\n\nTo compare them, let's examine their ratio:\n$$\\frac{v_{ad}(P)}{v_{iso}(P)} = \\frac{v_0 (P_0/P)^{1/\\gamma}}{v_0 (P_0/P)} = \\left(\\frac{P_0}{P}\\right)^{1/\\gamma - 1} = \\left(\\frac{P_0}{P}\\right)^{(1-\\gamma)/\\gamma}$$\nBy rewriting the exponent, we get:\n$$\\frac{v_{ad}(P)}{v_{iso}(P)} = \\left(\\left(\\frac{P_0}{P}\\right)^{-1}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} = \\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma}$$\nThe problem states that $\\gamma > 1$, which means the exponent $(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma$ is positive. Since we are compressing the gas to a final pressure $P_f > P_0$, any intermediate pressure $P$ satisfies $P > P_0$. Therefore, the base of the power, $P/P_0$, is greater than 1.\nA number greater than 1 raised to a positive power is still greater than 1.\n$$\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)^{(\\gamma-1)/\\gamma} > 1$$\nThis implies that:\n$$\\frac{v_{ad}(P)}{v_{iso}(P)} > 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad v_{ad}(P) > v_{iso}(P)$$\nThis result holds for every pressure $P$ in the interval $(P_0, P_f]$. Physically, this means that at any given pressure during the compression, the adiabatically compressed gas is hotter (since work is done on it without heat removal, its internal energy and thus temperature increase) and therefore occupies a larger volume than the isothermally compressed gas.\n\n**Comparison of Work**\nNow we can compare the work integrals:\n$$W_{iso} = \\int_{P_0}^{P_f} v_{iso}(P) \\, dP$$\n$$W_{ad} = \\int_{P_0}^{P_f} v_{ad}(P) \\, dP$$\nBoth integrals are over the same pressure interval $[P_0, P_f]$. We have shown that for all $P$ in $(P_0, P_f]$, the integrand for the adiabatic case is strictly greater than the integrand for the isothermal case: $v_{ad}(P) > v_{iso}(P)$.\nTherefore, the value of the integral for the adiabatic process must be greater than the value of the integral for the isothermal process.\n$$W_{ad} > W_{iso}$$\nThis means the reversible adiabatic process requires more work than the reversible isothermal process to achieve the same final pressure.\nThis conclusion matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1894447"}]}
