For a closed system that can be fully described by its absolute temperature $T$ and volume $V$, the student proposes that an infinitesimal change in the Helion, $dH$, is given by the differential:\n$$dH = T^{2} dV + V^{2} dT$$\nA quantity is considered a \"state function\" if its change between two equilibrium states depends only on the initial and final states, not on the specific path taken between them. Which of the following statements correctly describes the proposed Helion quantity, $H$?\n\nA. $H$ is a state function regardless of the material properties of the system.\n\nB. $H$ is not a state function for any system.\n\nC. Whether $H$ is a state function depends on the specific path taken between the initial and final states.\n\nD. $H$ is a state function only if the system behaves as an ideal gas, where $PV=nRT$.\n\nE.

For a differential $M(T,V)\\,dV+N(T,V)\\,dT$ to be exact on a simply connected domain, the integrability condition (equality of mixed partial derivatives) must hold:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial T}=\\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial V}.\n$$\n\nHere, the proposed form is\n$$\ndH=T^{2}\\,dV+V^{2}\\,dT,\n$$\nso we identify\n$$\nM(T,V)=T^{2}, \\quad N(T,V)=V^{2}.\n$$\nCompute the needed derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial T}=2T, \\quad \\frac{\\partial N}{\\partial V}=2V.\n$$\nThese are equal if and only if $T=V$. Since $T$ and $V$ are independent state variables, the condition does not hold on any open region of the $(T,V)$ state space. Therefore $dH$ is not exact, so there is no state function $H(T,V)$ whose differential equals $T^{2} dV+V^{2} dT$.\n\nA direct demonstration of path dependence confirms this. Consider two paths between $(T_{1},V_{1})$ and $(T_{2},V_{2})$:\n- Path A: change $V$ at fixed $T=T_{1}$, then change $T$ at fixed $V=V_{2}$.

The integral is\n$$\n\\Delta H_{B}=\\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{2}} V_{1}^{2}\\,dT+\\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} T_{2}^{2}\\,dV=V_{1}^{2}(T_{2}-T_{1})+T_{2}^{2}(V_{2}-V_{1}).\n$$\nThe difference is\n$$\n\\Delta H_{A}-\\Delta H_{B}=(T_{1}^{2}-T_{2}^{2})(V_{2}-V_{1})+(V_{2}^{2}-V_{1}^{2})(T_{2}-T_{1})=(V_{2}-V_{1})(T_{1}-T_{2})\\big[(T_{1}+T_{2})-(V_{1}+V_{2})\\big],\n$$\nwhich is generically nonzero. Hence the integral depends on the path, so $H$ is not a state function.\n\nBecause the proposed differential depends only on $T$ and $V$ and not on material-specific relations (such as an equation of state), no choice of material properties (including an ideal gas with $PV=nRT$) can alter the failure of the exactness condition. Therefore:\n- A is false because exactness fails.\n- B is true.\n- C is false because path dependence indicates non-state-function status; it does not make state-function status path contingent.\n- D is false; the equation of state does not repair the lack of exactness.\n- E is false; there is enough information to decide.\n\nThus the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1881827"}, {"introduction": "While state functions return to their original value after a complete cycle, path functions like work do not.
