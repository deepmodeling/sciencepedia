The pressure is not controlled and will generally change as sublimation proceeds.\n\nMatch constraints to the natural variables of the thermodynamic potentials:\n- The internal energy $U(S,V,N)$ has natural variables $S$, $V$, $N$; its differential is $dU=T\\,dS-P\\,dV+\\sum_{i}\\mu_{i}\\,dN_{i}$. The minimization principle for $U$ applies at fixed $S$, $V$, $N$, which does not match the present case because $T$ (not $S$) is controlled and heat exchange is allowed by the diathermal wall.\n- The enthalpy $H(S,P,N)$ has natural variables $S$, $P$, $N$; its differential is $dH=T\\,dS+V\\,dP+\\sum_{i}\\mu_{i}\\,dN_{i}$. The appropriate spontaneity criterion applies at fixed $S$, $P$, $N$, which does not match because $P$ is not fixed and $T$ is controlled rather than $S$.\n- The Helmholtz free energy $A(T,V,N)$ is defined by $A=U-TS$ with differential\n$$\ndA=dU-T\\,dS-S\\,dT=-S\\,dT-P\\,dV+\\sum_{i}\\mu_{i}\\,dN_{i}.\n$$\nIts natural variables are $T$, $V$, $N$.
