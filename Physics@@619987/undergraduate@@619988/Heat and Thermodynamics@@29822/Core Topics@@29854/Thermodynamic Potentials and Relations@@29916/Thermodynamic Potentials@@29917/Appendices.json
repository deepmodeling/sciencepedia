The cylinder contains $n$ moles of a monatomic ideal gas, which is initially at an absolute temperature $T_1$. An internal resistive heater slowly transfers energy to the gas, causing it to expand. This expansion occurs quasi-statically, meaning the gas is always in thermal equilibrium. Throughout the process, the piston moves to maintain pressure equilibrium between the gas and the constant external atmospheric pressure. The heating stops when the gas reaches a final absolute temperature $T_2$.\n\nDetermine the total change in the enthalpy, $\\Delta H$, of the gas during this process. Express your answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$, the universal gas constant $R$, $T_1$, and $T_2$.", "solution": "Because the gas is ideal and the process is quasi-static, the gas remains in equilibrium and obeys the ideal gas law at all times.

By analyzing a typical chemistry lab reaction [@problem_id:1900704], you will uncover the reason enthalpy change, $\\Delta H$, corresponds to the heat measured at constant pressure. This insight is crucial for correctly interpreting calorimetric data in chemistry and materials science.", "problem": "In a typical undergraduate chemistry laboratory, a chemist studies the thermal properties of a fictional decomposition reaction where a solid reactant, compound `X`, breaks down into a solid product, compound `Y`, and a gaseous product, compound `Z`. The balanced chemical equation is:\n\n$2\\text{X(s)} \\rightarrow \\text{Y(s)} + 3\\text{Z(g)}$\n\nThe reaction is carried out in a flask that is open to the atmosphere, and the heat released or absorbed by the reaction is measured using a calorimeter. Since the flask is open to the lab environment, the process occurs at a constant atmospheric pressure. The two primary thermodynamic quantities considered for energy changes are the internal energy, $U$, and the enthalpy, $H$, which is defined as $H = U + PV$, where $P$ is pressure and $V$ is volume.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental reason why the change in enthalpy, $\\Delta H$, rather than the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, is the quantity that directly corresponds to the heat measured by the calorimeter in this specific experimental setup?\n\nA. Enthalpy is a state function, whereas internal energy is path-dependent, making enthalpy a more reliable measure of energy change.\n\nB. For any process, the change in enthalpy, $\\Delta H$, is by definition equal to the heat ($q$) transferred to the system, according to the First Law of Thermodynamics.\n\nC. At constant pressure, the system does pressure-volume work on the surroundings as it expands. The enthalpy change, $\\Delta H$, correctly accounts for this work, making it equal to the heat exchanged, while the internal energy change, $\\Delta U$, does not.\n\nD. Internal energy only accounts for the kinetic energy of molecules, while enthalpy also includes the potential energy stored in chemical bonds, which is what changes during a reaction.\n\nE. The reaction produces a gas, which means the process is irreversible. Enthalpy is the correct potential to use for irreversible processes, while internal energy is reserved for reversible ones.\n\nF. Since the temperature is not held constant, the internal energy change is zero, and all energy changes are captured by the enthalpy.", "solution": "We start from the First Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system performing only pressure-volume work:\n$$\n\\Delta U = q - w.\n$$\nWith only pressure-volume work against a constant external pressure (open flask at atmospheric pressure), the work is\n$$\nw = \\int P_{\\text{ext}} \\, dV = P_{\\text{ext}} \\Delta V,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\Delta U = q_{p} - P_{\\text{ext}} \\Delta V.\n$$\nEnthalpy is defined as $H = U + PV$. For a process at constant pressure $P$ (here $P = P_{\\text{ext}}$) we have\n$$\n\\Delta H = \\Delta U + \\Delta(PV) = \\Delta U + P \\Delta V,\n$$\nbecause $\\Delta P = 0$. Substituting the expression for $\\Delta U$ gives\n$$\n\\Delta H = \\left(q_{p} - P \\Delta V\\right) + P \\Delta V = q_{p}.\n$$\nThus, at constant pressure with only pressure-volume work, the heat measured by the calorimeter equals the enthalpy change, not the internal energy change. In this experiment, gas production implies a volume change and associated $P\\Delta V$ work, which is accounted for in $\\Delta H$ at constant pressure, making $\\Delta H$ equal to the measured heat, whereas $\\Delta U$ differs by $-P\\Delta V$.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate reason is that at constant pressure the system does $PV$ work, and $\\Delta H$ accounts for this so that $\\Delta H = q_{p}$, while $\\Delta U \\neq q_{p}$. This corresponds to option C. Options A, B, D, E, and F are incorrect for the reasons that: both $U$ and $H$ are state functions (A); $\\Delta H = q$ is not true for any process but only at constant pressure with only $PV$ work (B); $U$ includes both kinetic and potential microscopic energies (D); reversibility does not select between $U$ and $H$ (E); and non-isothermal processes do not imply $\\Delta U = 0$ (F).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1900704"}, {"introduction": "This final practice reveals the fundamental power of thermodynamic potentials.
