The device consists of a fixed amount of an ideal gas enclosed in a cylinder that is sealed by a frictionless, massless piston. The external pressure on the piston is maintained at a constant value, which allows the gas to expand or contract freely while its internal pressure equalizes with the external pressure. The researcher wants to understand the sensitivity of the thermal device's volume to changes in temperature.\n\nLet the initial volume of the gas be $V_1$ and its initial absolute temperature be $T_1$. Suppose the design goal is to create an observable change in volume. To quantify this, the researcher decides to increase the volume of the gas by exactly 3.5% of its initial value.
