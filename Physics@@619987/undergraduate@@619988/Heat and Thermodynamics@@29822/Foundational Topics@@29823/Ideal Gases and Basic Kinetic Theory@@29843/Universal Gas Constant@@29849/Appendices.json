This first practice problem provides a foundational exercise in that skill, rooted in a practical safety consideration. By calculating the temperature at which a contained gas reaches a specific pressure, you'll directly apply the core relationship defined by the universal gas constant [@problem_id:1903028].", "problem": "A rigid, sealed container with a fixed internal volume $V$ is filled with $n$ moles of an ideal monatomic gas. The container is designed for a specific industrial process and must be stored at a low temperature before use. A crucial safety parameter is the temperature at which the internal pressure of the gas would equalize with the surrounding environment. Assuming the surrounding environment is at standard atmospheric pressure, denoted by $P_0$, determine the temperature of the gas at which this pressure equalization occurs. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $P_0$, $V$, $n$, and the universal gas constant, $R$.", "solution": "Because the gas is ideal and contained in a rigid, sealed container, the amount of substance $n$ and volume $V$ remain constant. The ideal gas law relates pressure $P$, volume $V$, amount $n$, and temperature $T$ by\n$$\nPV = nRT.\n$$\nThe pressure equalization with the surrounding environment occurs when the internal pressure equals $P_{0}$.

This practice problem simulates such a scenario by considering two separate gas containers that are connected, allowing the gases to mix. To determine the final pressure, you must apply the ideal gas law along with the principle of conservation of moles, demonstrating how the state of a combined system is a function of its initial parts [@problem_id:1903030].", "problem": "In a laboratory, a researcher has two separate, rigid containers for storing ideal gases. Container 1 has a fixed volume $V_1$ and is filled with an ideal gas to a pressure $P_1$. Container 2 has a fixed volume $V_2$ and is filled with a different ideal gas to a pressure $P_2$. Both containers and the gases within them are at the same initial absolute temperature, $T$.\n\nThe researcher then connects the two containers using a valve and a tube of negligible volume. The valve is opened, allowing the gases to mix freely between the two containers until the system reaches a new state of equilibrium. Assume that the containers are thermally insulated from their surroundings and that no chemical reaction occurs between the gases, such that the final temperature of the mixture remains $T$.\n\nDetermine the final equilibrium pressure, $P_f$, of the gas mixture in the combined system.

The containers are rigid, so the total volume is constant and equal to $V_{1} + V_{2}$.
