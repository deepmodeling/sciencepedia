By connecting two containers with different initial pressures and volumes, we can observe how the gas redistributes to reach a final equilibrium pressure. This scenario directly models the principle of conservation of matter at a constant temperature, where the total amount of gas (proportional to the $PV$ product) is conserved, leading to a final state that reflects a weighted average of the initial conditions. Understanding this is fundamental for many applications in laboratory settings and chemical process engineering.

The Argon cylinder has an internal volume of $V_g = 50.0$ liters and is initially at a pressure of $P_g = 130.0$ atm. The cylinder is connected to the chamber via a valve, and the entire system is maintained at a constant room temperature. The valve is then opened, allowing the Argon gas to expand into the vacuum chamber until the pressure equilibrates throughout the combined volume.
