The alloy is designed to have a sharp phase transition at a specific temperature. In an experiment, a sample of this alloy is kept in perfect thermal contact with a large heat reservoir, allowing for a controlled and very slow phase transition. This process is slow enough to be considered perfectly reversible and isothermal. During the transition, a carefully measured amount of heat, $Q = 50$ J, is absorbed by the sample from the reservoir. Concurrently, the entropy of the sample is measured to increase by an amount $\\Delta S = 0.2$ J/K.
