This gas has a constant molar heat capacity at constant volume, $C_{V,A}$. The cylinder is sealed by a frictionless, movable piston that is perfectly adiabatic. The walls of the cylinder, however, are diathermal and are in constant thermal contact with a solid block, which acts as a finite heat reservoir. The block has a total heat capacity of $C_B$. The ideal gas constant is denoted by $R$.\n\nInitially, the gas and the block are in thermal equilibrium with each other at a temperature $T_i$. The initial volume of the gas is $V_{A_i}$. The piston is then released, and the gas is allowed to expand quasi-statically against a constant external pressure, $P_{ext}$, until it reaches a final volume $V_{A_f}$. During this process, heat can be exchanged between the gas and the block, and they eventually settle into a new, common final equilibrium temperature, $T_f$.\n\nDetermine an expression for the final temperature $T_f$ in terms of the given parameters: $n_A$, $C_{V,A}$, $C_B$, $T_i$, $V_{A_i}$, $V_{A_f}$, and $P_{ext}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the final equilibrium temperature of a composite system consisting of a gas and a solid block. We will apply the First Law of Thermodynamics to this combined system.\n\nLet the system be defined as the combination of the gas (subsystem A) and the solid block (subsystem B). The total internal energy of this system is $U_{sys} = U_A + U_B$.

The entire gas-block assembly is described as part of an isolated setup, meaning it is thermally sealed from the external environment. Therefore, there is no heat transfer between our defined system (gas + block) and the surroundings. So, $Q = 0$.\n\nHowever, the gas expands against a constant external pressure $P_{ext}$, so the system does work on the surroundings.
