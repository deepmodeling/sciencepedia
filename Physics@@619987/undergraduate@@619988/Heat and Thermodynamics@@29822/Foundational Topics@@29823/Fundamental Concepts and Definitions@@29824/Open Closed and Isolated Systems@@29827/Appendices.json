One compartment contains $n$ moles of a monatomic ideal gas at an initial pressure $P_i$ and initial temperature $T_i$. The other compartment is a complete vacuum.

The partition is ruptured, allowing the gas to undergo a free expansion, filling the entire tank until it reaches an intermediate equilibrium state.\n2.  After the expansion is complete, an internal paddle wheel, driven by an external source, performs work on the gas. This is an isochoric (constant volume) process that continues until the pressure of the gas is restored to its original value, $P_i$.\n\nDerive an expression for the total entropy generated ($\\Delta S_{gen}$) by this entire two-step process, in terms of the number of moles $n$ and the ideal gas constant $R$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total entropy generated, which is the entropy change of the universe, $\\Delta S_{universe}$. Since the tank is rigid and insulated, the system is isolated from its surroundings. This means there is no heat or matter exchange with the surroundings. Consequently, the entropy change of the surroundings is zero ($\\Delta S_{surr} = 0$). Therefore, the total entropy generated is equal to the entropy change of the system (the gas).\n$$\n\\Delta S_{gen} = \\Delta S_{universe} = \\Delta S_{sys} + \\Delta S_{surr} = \\Delta S_{sys}\n$$\nThe total process consists of two sequential steps. We can find the total entropy change of the system by summing the entropy changes for each step:\n$$\n\\Delta S_{sys} = \\Delta S_1 + \\Delta S_2\n$$\n\n**Step 1: Free Expansion**\n\nThe gas expands from an initial volume $V_i$ to a final volume $V_f = 2V_i$. This is a free expansion into a vacuum.\n-   No work is done by the gas on the surroundings because it expands against zero external pressure: $W_1 = 0$.\n-   No heat is transferred to or from the gas because the tank is insulated: $Q_1 = 0$.\n\nApplying the First Law of Thermodynamics to the gas:\n$$\n\\Delta U_1 = Q_1 - W_1 = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nFor an ideal gas, the internal energy $U$ is solely a function of temperature, $U(T)$. Since $\\Delta U_1 = 0$, the temperature of the gas does not change during the free expansion.

The pressure can be found from the ideal gas law: $P_2 V_2 = nRT_2 \\implies P_2 (2V_i) = nRT_i$. Since $P_i V_i = nRT_i$, we have $P_2 = P_i/2$.\n-   State 3: The process is isochoric, so $V_3 = V_2 = 2V_i$. The final pressure is given as $P_3 = P_i$.\n\nWe need to find the final temperature, $T_3$. Using the ideal gas law for states 2 and 3:\n$$\n\\frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2} = \\frac{P_3 V_3}{T_3}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{(P_i/2) (2V_i)}{T_i} = \\frac{P_i (2V_i)}{T_3}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{P_i V_i}{T_i} = \\frac{2P_i V_i}{T_3} \\implies T_3 = 2T_i\n$$\nNow we calculate the entropy change for the second step (state 2 $\\to$ state 3).
