This exercise [@problem_id:1901156] challenges you to classify a system undergoing a chemical reaction under two different boundary conditions, honing your ability to distinguish between closed and isolated systems based on the potential for energy transfer as work or heat.", "problem": "An effervescent antacid tablet, which releases carbon dioxide gas upon reacting with water, is dropped into a vertical cylinder containing water. The cylinder is sealed from the top by a frictionless, movable piston. The system is defined as the contents within the cylinder (the water, the tablet, and any gases produced). Initially, this system is in thermal and mechanical equilibrium with the surroundings, which are at a constant atmospheric pressure $P_{atm}$ and temperature $T_{surr}$. After the tablet is added, the chemical reaction begins, producing gas and causing the piston to move.\n\nConsider the following two distinct scenarios for the properties of the cylinder and piston:\n\n**Scenario I**: The cylinder and piston are constructed from a perfect thermal insulator (adiabatic walls).\n\n**Scenario II**: The cylinder and piston are constructed from a perfect thermal conductor (diathermal walls), and the reaction and subsequent expansion occur slowly enough that the system's temperature remains equal to $T_{surr}$ at all times.\n\nFor each scenario, classify the thermodynamic system *during the process* in which the reaction occurs and the piston moves.

The boundary is the inner surface of the cylinder and the movable piston. The cylinder is sealed, so no material can cross the system boundary during the process. Therefore, mass conservation across the boundary implies\n$$\\dot{m}_{\\text{in}}=\\dot{m}_{\\text{out}}=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\Delta m=0,$$\nwhich is the defining condition for a closed system (no mass transfer).\n\nScenario I (adiabatic walls): The walls and piston are perfect thermal insulators, so there is no heat transfer,\n$$\\delta Q=0.$$\nThe piston is frictionless and movable, so boundary work occurs when the gas expands,\n$$\\delta W = P_{\\text{ext}}\\,\\mathrm{d}V \\neq 0 \\text{ in general}.$$\nBecause energy crosses the boundary via work, the system is not isolated. Since $\\Delta m=0$, it is a closed system.\n\nScenario II (diathermal walls with quasi-static expansion at $T=T_{\\text{surr}}$): The walls and piston conduct heat perfectly, and the process is slow enough to maintain\n$$T(t)=T_{\\text{surr}} \\quad \\forall t,$$\nwhich generally requires nonzero heat exchange,\n$$\\delta Q \\neq 0.$$\nThe piston moves, so boundary work occurs,\n$$\\delta W = P_{\\text{ext}}\\,\\mathrm{d}V \\neq 0 \\text{ in general}.$$\nAgain, no mass crosses the boundary, so $\\Delta m=0$ and the system is closed.

Mechanical work done on a system, especially when dissipated by forces like viscosity, can also be converted directly into thermal energy. This practice problem [@problem_id:1901141] explores a scenario analogous to James Prescott Joule's famous paddle-wheel experiment, challenging you to quantify the temperature change in an insulated liquid that is vigorously shaken.", "problem": "A food scientist is testing the properties of a new type of nutrient-rich broth. A volume $V$ of the broth is placed into a futuristic, perfectly thermally insulating container. The broth has a mass density $\\rho$ and a specific heat capacity $c$. Its initial temperature is measured to be $T_i$.\n\nTo investigate the effects of mechanical agitation, the container is shaken vigorously by a machine for a total duration of $t$. This process does work on the broth, and due to the broth's internal viscosity, this work is entirely converted into thermal energy. The machine delivers energy to the broth at a constant average power, $P$.\n\nAssuming the volume, density, and specific heat capacity of the broth do not change with temperature, determine the final temperature, $T_f$, of the broth after it has been shaken. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $V$, $\\rho$, $c$, $T_i$, $P$, and $t$.", "solution": "The container is perfectly thermally insulating, so there is no heat exchange with the surroundings. By the first law of thermodynamics for the broth as the system, the change in internal energy satisfies $\\Delta U = Q + W_{\\text{on}}$, with $Q=0$ and $W_{\\text{on}}$ equal to the mechanical energy delivered by the machine. The power input is constant, so the total work done on the broth over time $t$ is the energy\n$$\nW_{\\text{on}}=\\int_{0}^{t} P \\, dt' = P t.\n$$\nAssuming the specific heat capacity $c$ is constant and there is no phase change, the change in internal energy due to a temperature change from $T_{i}$ to $T_{f}$ is\n$$\n\\Delta U = m c \\left(T_{f} - T_{i}\\right),\n$$\nwhere the mass of the broth is $m=\\rho V$.

In this problem [@problem_id:1901194], we analyze a seemingly simple event—an air bubble rising in a lake—through the lens of thermodynamics. To find the heat absorbed by the bubble, you will need to apply the First Law to an isothermal process, connecting the concepts of work, heat, and the properties of an ideal gas in a changing environment.", "problem": "A scuba diver exhales a small bubble of air at an initial depth $h_i$ below the surface of a large, calm lake. The bubble contains $n$ moles of air. The bubble then rises slowly towards the surface, reaching a final depth of $h_f$. The temperature of the lake water, $T_w$, is uniform at all depths. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is $P_{atm}$. The water has a constant density $\\rho_w$, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nAssume the air in the bubble behaves as an ideal gas and that the ascent is slow enough for the air to always be in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding water. Furthermore, you may neglect the effects of surface tension on the pressure inside the bubble.\n\nDetermine a symbolic expression for the total heat absorbed by the air in the bubble during its ascent from $h_i$ to $h_f$. Your expression should be in terms of $n$, $T_w$, $P_{atm}$, $\\rho_w$, $g$, $h_i$, $h_f$, and the molar gas constant $R$.", "solution": "At a depth $h$ below the surface, the hydrostatic pressure in the water is $P(h)=P_{atm}+\\rho_{w} g h$. Neglecting surface tension implies the bubble’s internal pressure equals the ambient hydrostatic pressure at its depth. The water temperature is uniform, and the ascent is slow enough that the gas in the bubble remains in thermal equilibrium with the water; thus the process for the gas is isothermal at $T_{w}$. The bubble contains a fixed amount $n$ of ideal gas, so the ideal gas law gives $P V=n R T_{w}$ along the entire path.\n\nFor a quasi-static (reversible) isothermal process of an ideal gas, the change in internal energy is zero ($\\Delta U=0$). Per the First Law ($\\Delta U = Q + W_{on}$), the heat absorbed $Q$ must equal the work done *by* the gas ($W_{by}$), since $W_{by} = -W_{on}$.
