Here, you will determine the boundary work done in a piston-cylinder device where the restraining force depends on a spring and atmospheric pressure.

The piston has a mass $m_p$ and a cross-sectional area $A$. It is initially resting at the bottom of the cylinder, and at this position, an attached linear spring is at its natural length (exerting no force). The device is surrounded by the atmosphere, which is at a constant pressure $P_{atm}$. Air is then allowed to enter the cylinder from a high-pressure supply line, causing the piston to rise.

Express your answer in kilojoules (kJ), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The system under consideration is the air inside the piston-cylinder device, which is a control volume as mass enters it. The boundary work done by the system is given by the integral of the system pressure $P$ with respect to its volume $V$:\n$$ W_b = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P \\, dV $$\nThe initial state is an evacuated cylinder, so the initial volume is $V_1 = 0$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the relationship between the pressure $P$ of the air inside the cylinder and its volume $V$. The piston will not begin to move until the upward force exerted by the air pressure on the inner face of the piston overcomes the downward forces. These downward forces are the weight of the piston ($m_p g$) and the force due to atmospheric pressure ($P_{atm} A$). Let's denote the pressure at which the piston just begins to lift as $P_0$. At this point, the spring is still at its natural length and exerts no force.\nA force balance on the piston yields:\n$$ P_0 A = P_{atm} A + m_p g $$\n$$ P_0 = P_{atm} + \\frac{m_p g}{A} $$\nAs air fills the cylinder from $P=0$ up to $P=P_0$, the piston remains at the bottom, so the volume stays at $V=0$. Therefore, no boundary work is done during this initial phase of pressurization.\n\nOnce the pressure exceeds $P_0$, the piston begins to move upwards. For any displacement $x$ of the piston from the bottom, the volume of the air is $V = A x$. The spring is compressed by this distance $x$, exerting a downward force $F_{sp} = kx$. The force balance on the piston for any volume $V > 0$ is:\n$$ P A = P_{atm} A + m_p g + F_{sp} $$\nSubstituting $F_{sp} = kx$ and $x = V/A$:\n$$ P A = P_{atm} A + m_p g + k \\frac{V}{A} $$\nDividing by $A$, we get the pressure-volume relationship during the expansion process:\n$$ P(V) = \\left( P_{atm} + \\frac{m_p g}{A} \\right) + \\frac{k}{A^2} V $$\nRecognizing the term in the parenthesis as $P_0$, we have:\n$$ P(V) = P_0 + \\frac{k}{A^2} V $$\nThis shows that the pressure of the gas increases linearly with volume once the piston starts moving.\n\nThe total boundary work is the work done during the expansion from $V_1=0$ to the final volume $V_2$.\n$$ W_b = \\int_{0}^{V_2} P(V) \\, dV = \\int_{0}^{V_2} \\left( P_0 + \\frac{k}{A^2} V \\right) dV $$\nSince the pressure is a linear function of volume, the work done is the area of a trapezoid on a P-V diagram.
