From company datasheets, the normal boiling point of pure Evolene is $82.5^\\circ\\text{C}$ and the normal boiling point of pure Fumaron is $111.0^\\circ\\text{C}$. Experimental analysis reveals that this binary mixture forms an azeotrope that has a normal boiling point of $76.2^\\circ\\text{C}$. The engineer prepares a batch of the mixture and plans to separate the components using fractional distillation at standard atmospheric pressure.\n\nBased on the data provided, which of the following statements accurately describes the behavior of this mixture?\n\nA.

Therefore, the system forms a minimum-boiling azeotrope.\n\nAt an azeotrope, the equilibrium vapor and liquid compositions are identical, i.e.,\n$$y_{E}^{\\text{az}}=x_{E}^{\\text{az}},\\qquad y_{F}^{\\text{az}}=x_{F}^{\\text{az}},\\qquad x_{E}^{\\text{az}}+x_{F}^{\\text{az}}=1.$$\nIn fractional distillation at a given pressure, the species or mixture with the lowest boiling temperature is the most volatile and preferentially appears at the top of an efficient column. For a minimum-boiling azeotrope, the azeotrope itself is the most volatile “pseudo-component,” having the smallest boiling temperature $T_{\\text{az}}$. Consequently, the initial distillate from a well-functioning fractionating column at standard pressure will have the azeotropic composition.\n\nEliminating the other options:\n- Maximum-boiling statements are incompatible with $T_{\\text{az}}T_{b,E}$ and $T_{\\text{az}}T_{b,F}$, so options B and E are false.\n- The initial distillate cannot be pure Evolene or pure Fumaron in the presence of a minimum-boiling azeotrope acting as the most volatile composition, so options C and D are false.\n- The existence of an azeotrope prevents complete separation into pure components at the same pressure by a single fractional distillation, so option F is false.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the system forms a minimum-boiling azeotrope and the initial distillate collected will have the azeotropic composition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1982371"}, {"introduction": "After classifying an azeotrope using its boiling point [@problem_id:1982371], the next step is to visualize the system's complete behavior across all compositions. Temperature-composition ($T-x-y$) diagrams are powerful tools for this, mapping the liquid and vapor phase boundaries. This practice challenges you to interpret the key features of such a diagram, reinforcing your understanding of how the bubble point and dew point curves define the azeotropic point and the two-phase region [@problem_id:1842810].", "problem": "Consider a binary liquid mixture of two volatile components, designated as component 1 and component 2, studied at a constant external pressure. This mixture is known to exhibit significant positive deviations from Raoult's law, leading to the formation of a minimum-boiling azeotrope.

Let's analyze the thermodynamics and phase diagram features of such a system to evaluate each option.\n\n**Fundamentals of T-x-y Diagrams:**\n- A T-x-y diagram at constant pressure shows the phase boundaries for a binary mixture.\n- The region below the entire phase envelope is the single-phase liquid region.\n- The region above the entire phase envelope is the single-phase vapor region.\n- The region enclosed between the bubble point and dew point curves is the two-phase region where liquid and vapor coexist in equilibrium.\n- The **bubble point curve** is the boundary between the liquid region and the two-phase region. It plots the boiling temperature as a function of the liquid composition ($x_1$).\n- The **dew point curve** is the boundary between the vapor region and the two-phase region. It plots the condensation temperature as a function of the vapor composition ($y_1$).\n- For a two-phase system at a given temperature, a horizontal line (a tie line) connects the liquid composition on the bubble point curve ($x_1$) with the vapor composition on the dew point curve ($y_1$) with which it is in equilibrium.\n\n**Minimum-Boiling Azeotrope:**\n- An azeotrope is a mixture that boils at a constant temperature without a change in composition. At the azeotropic point, the composition of the liquid is identical to the composition of the vapor ($x_1 = y_1$).\n- A \"minimum-boiling\" azeotrope means that the boiling temperature at the azeotropic composition is lower than the boiling temperature of either pure component. This occurs when intermolecular forces between unlike molecules (1-2) are weaker than the average of the forces between like molecules (1-1 and 2-2), a phenomenon known as positive deviation from Raoult's law.\n- On the T-x-y diagram, this behavior manifests as both the bubble point curve and the dew point curve dipping to a common minimum temperature at the azeotropic composition. Because $x_1 = y_1$ at this point, the two curves must touch.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on these principles:\n\n**A. The bubble point curve and the dew point curve intersect at exactly one point corresponding to the azeotropic composition, where the temperature reaches a maximum value for the entire system.**\nThis statement is partially correct in that the curves intersect at the azeotropic composition. However, it incorrectly states that the temperature reaches a *maximum* value. For a minimum-boiling azeotrope, the temperature at this point is a *minimum*. This option describes a maximum-boiling azeotrope. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B. At any temperature where both liquid and vapor phases coexist, the vapor phase is always richer in the component that has the higher pure boiling point.**\nThis is incorrect. For a minimum-boiling azeotrope, the mixture's boiling point is lower than either pure component. The mixture behaves as if it's \"more volatile\" than either component. On one side of the azeotrope, the vapor is richer in component 1; on the other side, it's richer in component 2. This statement is a misapplication of the rules for ideal solutions. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n**C. The dew point curve is located at lower temperatures than the bubble point curve across the entire composition range, except at the points corresponding to the pure components.**\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The region between the curves represents the coexistence of liquid and vapor. To enter this region from the liquid phase (below), one must heat the liquid until it reaches the bubble point curve. To enter from the vapor phase (above), one must cool the vapor until it reaches the dew point curve. This means the dew point curve must be at higher temperatures than the bubble point curve, forming the upper boundary of the two-phase region. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D. The system forms a two-phase (liquid + vapor) region that is bounded below by the bubble point curve and above by the dew point curve. These two curves meet at the azeotropic point, which corresponds to a minimum temperature on the diagram.**\nThis statement correctly describes the topology of the phase diagram. The bubble point curve is the lower boundary (T vs. $x_1$) of the two-phase region, and the dew point curve is the upper boundary (T vs. $y_1$). For a minimum-boiling azeotrope, these curves dip down and touch at the azeotropic composition, which is the point of azeotropic boiling. This point represents the lowest boiling temperature in the entire system. Therefore, option D is correct.\n\n**E. Fractional distillation of any mixture of components 1 and 2 will always successfully separate them into pure component 1 and pure component 2.**\nThis is a key misconception about azeotropes. The existence of an azeotrope prevents complete separation by simple or fractional distillation. If you start with a composition on one side of the azeotrope, distillation will yield one pure component and the azeotropic mixture. If you start with the azeotropic composition itself, the mixture will boil without any change in composition, making separation impossible by this method. Therefore, option E is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, option D provides the only fully accurate description.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1842810"}, {"introduction": "Visualizing phase diagrams [@problem_id:1842810] provides a qualitative map, but chemical engineering requires precise quantitative predictions.
