This problem explores the colorful equilibrium between two cobalt(II) complex ions, providing a direct visual indicator of shifts caused by changes in concentration and temperature. By analyzing these scenarios, you will practice applying Le Châtelier's principle to predict how a system counteracts stresses to re-establish equilibrium [@problem_id:2002306].", "problem": "In an aqueous solution, the cobalt(II) ion exists in an equilibrium between two different complex ions, the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion, $[\\text{Co}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$, which is pink, and the tetrachlorocobaltate(II) ion, $[\\text{CoCl}_4]^{2-}$, which is blue.

Dissolving a small amount of solid potassium nitrate ($\\text{KNO}_3$).", "solution": "The question asks to identify which procedure will cause the equilibrium to shift in a direction that makes the solution more intensely blue. The blue-colored species is the tetrachlorocobaltate(II) ion, $[\\text{CoCl}_4]^{2-}$, which is on the product side of the given reaction. Therefore, we need to find the procedure that shifts the equilibrium to the right. We will analyze each option using Le Châtelier's principle, which states that if a change of condition is applied to a system in equilibrium, the system will shift in a direction that counteracts the change.\n\nThe equilibrium reaction is:\n$$[\\text{Co}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}(aq, \\text{pink}) + 4 \\text{Cl}^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons [\\text{CoCl}_4]^{2-}(aq, \\text{blue}) + 6 \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l) \\quad (\\Delta H > 0)$$\n\n**Analysis of Option A: Adding a large volume of distilled water.**\nAdding water has two effects. First, it dilutes all the dissolved species ($[\\text{Co}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$, $\\text{Cl}^-$, and $[\\text{CoCl}_4]^{2-}$). The reactant side has $1+4=5$ moles of aqueous ions, while the product side has only 1 mole of aqueous ions. To counteract the overall decrease in concentration, the equilibrium will shift to the side with a greater number of dissolved particles, which is the left side. Second, water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) is a product in the reaction. Increasing the concentration of a product will cause the equilibrium to shift to the left to consume the added product. Both effects push the equilibrium to the left, favoring the formation of the pink $[\\text{Co}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$ ion. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option B: Adding a small amount of solid silver nitrate ($\\text{AgNO}_3$).**\nSolid silver nitrate dissolves in the aqueous solution to produce silver ions ($\\text{Ag}^+$) and nitrate ions ($\\text{NO}_3^-$). The silver ions will react with the chloride ions ($\\text{Cl}^-$) in the solution to form solid silver chloride ($\\text{AgCl}$), which is insoluble and precipitates out. The net ionic reaction for the precipitation is $\\text{Ag}^+(aq) + \\text{Cl}^-(aq) \\rightarrow \\text{AgCl}(s)$. This process removes chloride ions, a reactant in the main equilibrium, from the solution. According to Le Châtelier's principle, a decrease in the concentration of a reactant will cause the equilibrium to shift to the left to replenish the removed reactant. This shift favors the pink complex. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option C: Placing the sample in an ice bath at 0 °C.**\nPlacing the sample in an ice bath lowers the temperature of the system. The problem states that the forward reaction is endothermic, meaning it absorbs heat ($\\Delta H > 0$). Consequently, the reverse reaction is exothermic (releases heat, $\\Delta H  0$). According to Le Châtelier's principle, if the temperature is decreased, the equilibrium will shift in the exothermic direction to produce heat and counteract the cooling. Therefore, the equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of the pink $[\\text{Co}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})_6]^{2+}$ ion. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n**Analysis of Option D: Adding a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid ($\\text{HCl}$).**\nHydrochloric acid is a strong acid that fully dissociates in water, providing a high concentration of hydrogen ions ($\\text{H}^+$) and chloride ions ($\\text{Cl}^-$). The addition of concentrated $\\text{HCl}$ significantly increases the concentration of $\\text{Cl}^-$ in the system. Chloride ion is a reactant in the equilibrium. According to Le Châtelier's principle, an increase in the concentration of a reactant will cause the equilibrium to shift to the right to consume the added reactant. This shift favors the formation of the products, including the blue $[\\text{CoCl}_4]^{2-}$ ion. Thus, option D is correct.\n\n**Analysis of Option E: Dissolving a small amount of solid potassium nitrate ($\\text{KNO}_3$).**\nSolid potassium nitrate dissolves to yield potassium ions ($\\text{K}^+$) and nitrate ions ($\\text{NO}_3^-$). Neither of these ions participates directly in the cobalt complex equilibrium. They are spectator ions. Their addition does not significantly change the concentrations of the reacting species or the temperature. Therefore, adding potassium nitrate will not cause a significant shift in the equilibrium position. The color of the solution will remain largely unchanged. Thus, option E is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis of all options, only the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid will shift the equilibrium to the right and cause the solution to become more intensely blue.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2002306"}, {"introduction": "Le Châtelier's principle extends beyond chemical reactions to physical equilibria, such as phase transitions. This thought experiment examines the delicate balance between ice and liquid water, focusing on how pressure affects the equilibrium.

The equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of more ice, because the solid phase is more structured and resistant to compression.\n\nB. The equilibrium will shift to the right, favoring the formation of more liquid water, as this phase change leads to a reduction in the system's total volume.\n\nC. The equilibrium will be unaffected, because pressure changes have a negligible impact on equilibria involving only condensed phases (solids and liquids).\n\nD. The equilibrium will shift to the left, favoring the formation of more ice, because for most substances, increasing pressure raises the freezing point.\n\nE.

Fusion increases disorder, so $\\Delta S=S_{l}-S_{s}>0$. Therefore\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dP}=\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta S}0,\n$$\ni.e., increasing pressure lowers the melting temperature.\n\nNow consider a sudden increase in external pressure $dP>0$ on the mixture. At fixed temperature, the change in the phase chemical potentials with pressure satisfies\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T}=\\bar{V},\n$$\nso the change in the difference is\n$$\nd(\\mu_{l}-\\mu_{s})=\\Delta V\\,dP.\n$$\nSince $\\Delta V0$ and $dP>0$, we have $d(\\mu_{l}-\\mu_{s})0$, implying $\\mu_{l}-\\mu_{s}0$ after the pressure jump. Thus the liquid has the lower chemical potential and is thermodynamically favored. The system will shift toward the phase with smaller molar volume to reduce its Gibbs energy, i.e., more liquid water will form.\n\nBecause the container is thermally insulated, any melting absorbs latent heat $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}>0$, which tends to offset any temperature rise due to compression. Regardless of the transient temperature response, the direction of the equilibrium shift under increased pressure is dictated by the sign of $\\Delta V0$, favoring the liquid. This is consistent with Le Chatelier’s principle: increasing pressure favors the side with smaller total volume.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the equilibrium shifts to the right, producing more liquid water because this phase change reduces the system’s total volume.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2002282"}, {"introduction": "While Le Châtelier's principle allows for qualitative predictions, its true power is rooted in thermodynamics.
