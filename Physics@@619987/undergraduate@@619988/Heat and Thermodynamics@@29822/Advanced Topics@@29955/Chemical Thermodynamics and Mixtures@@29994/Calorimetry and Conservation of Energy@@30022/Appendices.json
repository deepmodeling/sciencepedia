This exercise [@problem_id:1846760] emphasizes symbolic reasoning, allowing you to focus on the physical principles of heat transfer, where the heat transferred $Q$ is related to mass $m$, specific heat capacity $c$, and temperature change $\\Delta T$ via $Q = mc\\Delta T$.", "problem": "Two solid metal blocks, one made of pure aluminum (Al) and the other of pure copper (Cu), both have an identical mass $m$. The blocks are initially in thermal equilibrium in an oven at a high temperature $T_i$.
