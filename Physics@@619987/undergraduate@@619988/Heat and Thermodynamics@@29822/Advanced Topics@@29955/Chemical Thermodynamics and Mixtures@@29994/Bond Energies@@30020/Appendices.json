The fundamental principle is that the enthalpy change of a reaction is approximately equal to the total energy required to break the chemical bonds in the reactants minus the total energy released upon forming the chemical bonds in the products.\n\nThe formula can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta H \\approx \\sum (\\text{Bond energies of bonds broken}) - \\sum (\\text{Bond energies of bonds formed}) $$\n\nFirst, we need to identify and quantify all the bonds broken in the reactants. The reactants are one mole of methane ($\\text{CH}_4$) and one mole of water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$).\n\nThe structure of methane ($\\text{CH}_4$) consists of a central carbon atom single-bonded to four hydrogen atoms.
