The initial liquid mixture consists of two key organic compounds, Aethelane and Bivonol. The mixture is prepared such that the initial mole fraction of Aethelane in the liquid phase is $x_A = 0.300$. The mixture can be considered an ideal solution over the temperature range of interest. The mixture is slowly heated at constant pressure in a batch distillation apparatus. At the specific temperature where the first bubble of vapor forms, the pure component vapor pressure of Aethelane is $P_A^* = 98.7 \\text{ kPa}$ and the pure component vapor pressure of Bivonol is $P_B^* = 35.2 \\text{ kPa}$.\n\nDetermine the mole fraction of Aethelane in this very first bubble of vapor that is formed.
