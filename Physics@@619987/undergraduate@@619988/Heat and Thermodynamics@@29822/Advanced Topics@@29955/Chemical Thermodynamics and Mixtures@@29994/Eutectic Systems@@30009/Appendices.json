In this system, the Sn-rich solid phase is designated as $\\alpha$, and the Bi-rich solid phase is designated as $\\beta$. The eutectic point occurs at a composition of 58 wt% Bi and a temperature of 138 °C, where the liquid phase transforms directly into a solid mixture of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe student melts a sample of the alloy and then cools it slowly to room temperature. A metallographic analysis of the resulting solid reveals a microstructure consisting of large, blocky, primary crystals of the $\\beta$ phase, which are surrounded by a fine, alternating lamellar (plate-like) structure composed of both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ phases.\n\nBased on this microstructural observation, which of the following statements correctly categorizes the alloy?\n\nA. The alloy is hypoeutectic because the microstructure contains primary crystals.\n\nB. The alloy is hypereutectic because primary $\\beta$ phase is observed.\n\nC.

On reaching $T_{E}$, the remaining liquid transforms via $L \\to \\alpha + \\beta$, producing the eutectic lamellar mixture surrounding the primary $\\beta$.\n- If $C_{0}=C_{E}$ (exact eutectic), no primary phase appears; the entire microstructure is the fine eutectic $\\alpha+\\beta$ mixture without blocky primary crystals.\n\nThe observed microstructure consists of large, blocky primary $\\beta$ crystals surrounded by a fine lamellar $\\alpha+\\beta$ eutectic.
