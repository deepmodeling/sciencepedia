This problem [@problem_id:1883049] moves from quantitative calculations to the crucial skill of interpreting experimental observations to understand the dynamic process of phase transformation upon cooling. By analyzing the sequence of events, you will learn to distinguish a peritectic reaction—where a liquid and a solid react to form a new solid—from other invariant reactions, deepening your understanding of how complex microstructures evolve.", "problem": "A materials research team is investigating the solidification behavior of a hypothetical binary alloy composed of \"Corbomite\" (Cb) and \"Tricobalt\" (Tc). A liquid mixture with an initial composition of 65 atomic percent Tc is prepared and cooled very slowly from a high temperature, allowing the system to remain in equilibrium at each stage. The phases present in the alloy are monitored as a function of temperature.\n\nThe following sequence of events is observed:\n1.  Above a temperature $T_1$, the entire sample is a uniform liquid phase, denoted L.\n2.  Upon cooling below $T_1$, a solid phase, designated $\\alpha$, begins to precipitate from the liquid. In the temperature range between $T_1$ and a lower temperature $T_2$, the sample consists of a mixture of solid $\\alpha$ and liquid L.\n3.  At the specific temperature $T_2$, a second solid phase, designated $\\beta$, begins to form. As the system is held at this constant temperature $T_2$ while heat is extracted, the amount of the initial solid phase $\\alpha$ is observed to decrease continuously.\n4.  After further heat extraction at temperature $T_2$, all of the solid phase $\\alpha$ is eventually consumed. With continued slow cooling *below* $T_2$, the sample is observed to consist of a mixture of solid phase $\\beta$ and liquid L.\n5.  Finally, as the alloy cools from just below $T_2$ to a final solidification temperature $T_3$, the remaining liquid transforms entirely into the solid phase $\\beta$. The final solid product at room temperature consists of only the single phase $\\beta$.\n\nBased on this detailed sequence of equilibrium phase transformations, which of the following statements most accurately describes the nature of the reaction occurring at temperature $T_2$?\n\nA. A eutectic reaction occurs, where the liquid transforms into a two-phase solid mixture of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nB. Phase $\\beta$ is a congruently melting compound, and the process at $T_2$ is the start of a eutectic reaction involving terminal solid solutions.\n\nC. A peritectic reaction occurs, in which the liquid and the primary solid phase $\\alpha$ react to form the new solid phase $\\beta$.\n\nD. The alloy undergoes a monotectic reaction, in which one liquid phase transforms into a solid phase and a second, immiscible liquid phase.\n\nE. A solid-state peritectoid reaction occurs, where two solid phases react to form a new solid phase.", "solution": "We analyze the sequence of equilibrium transformations and match them to the standard invariant reactions in binary alloys, using their defining equations and signatures.\n\nFirst, above $T_{1}$ the system is a single liquid phase $L$. Upon cooling below $T_{1}$, solid $\\alpha$ precipitates from $L$, so the two-phase field between $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ is $L + \\alpha$. This is typical of primary solidification of $\\alpha$ in a binary phase diagram as the composition follows the liquidus and solidus tie-lines.\n\nAt $T_{2}$, a new solid phase $\\beta$ begins to form, and when the system is held at $T_{2}$ while heat is extracted, the amount of the initial solid $\\alpha$ decreases continuously until it can be fully consumed. This behavior is the defining kinetic and phase-fraction signature of a peritectic reaction, in which the liquid and the primary solid react isothermally to form a new solid:\n$$\nL + \\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta \\quad \\text{at } T_{2}.\n$$\nAt an invariant reaction in a binary system at fixed pressure, the Gibbs phase rule gives\n$$\nF = C - P + 1,\n$$\nwith $C=2$ components and $P=3$ phases ($L$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$), hence $F=0$. This implies a fixed temperature and compositions while the relative phase amounts change at $T_{2}$, exactly as observed (the fraction of $\\alpha$ decreases while $\\beta$ grows at constant $T_{2}$).\n\nAfter all $\\alpha$ is consumed at $T_{2}$, further slow cooling below $T_{2}$ yields the two-phase field $L + \\beta$, consistent with being on the $\\beta$ side of the peritectic. Finally, as the temperature decreases to $T_{3}$, the remaining liquid solidifies completely to $\\beta$, leaving a single-phase $\\beta$ microstructure at room temperature. This is fully consistent with a peritectic path for an overall alloy composition that ends in the $\\beta$ single-phase field at low temperature.\n\nWe now rule out the alternatives:\n- Eutectic reaction: $L \\rightarrow \\alpha + \\beta$ would produce two solid phases simultaneously at the eutectic temperature, and below that temperature the microstructure would be a mixture of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, not $L + \\beta$; moreover, at the eutectic isotherm the amount of a preexisting primary phase would not necessarily decrease to zero by reaction with $L$.\n- Monotectic reaction: $L_{1} \\rightarrow \\alpha + L_{2}$ involves two immiscible liquids, which is not observed.\n- Peritectoid reaction: $\\alpha + \\beta \\rightarrow \\gamma$ involves only solid phases, whereas a liquid is explicitly present at $T_{2}$.\n- Congruent melting compound and eutectic onset (option B) does not explain the observed consumption of $\\alpha$ at constant $T_{2}$ by reaction with the liquid, nor the presence of $L + \\beta$ below $T_{2}$ followed by complete transformation to single-phase $\\beta$.\n\nTherefore, the only description consistent with the observed isothermal consumption of $\\alpha$ at $T_{2}$ and the sequence of phases is the peritectic reaction $L + \\alpha \\rightarrow \\beta$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1883049"}]}
