The critical point is defined by a specific critical temperature $T_c$, critical pressure $P_c$, and critical molar volume $v_c$. The physicist needs to choose between two experimental approaches to bring the fluid as close as possible to its critical point in a controlled manner.\n\nPath A (Isochoric Path): The fluid is sealed in a strong, transparent container of fixed volume, such that its molar volume is exactly $v_c$. The temperature $T$ of the container is then slowly varied to approach $T_c$.\n\nPath B (Isothermal Path): The fluid is placed in a cylinder fitted with a movable piston, and the entire assembly is kept in a thermal bath at a constant temperature $T = T_c$. The external pressure $P$ on the piston is then slowly varied to approach $P_c$.\n\nThe \"controllability\" of an experiment is related to the stability of the system's state in response to small, unavoidable fluctuations in the controlled parameter. A path is considered more controllable if a small error in the control variable (e.g., $T$ or $P$) results in a small and predictable change in the state of the system.\n\nFrom theoretical models and previous experiments, it is known that for a fluid near its critical point:\n1. The isothermal compressibility, $\\kappa_T = -\\frac{1}{V}\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_T$, which quantifies the fractional change in volume for a given change in pressure at constant temperature, diverges to infinity.\n2. The isochoric pressure coefficient, $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$, which quantifies the change in pressure for a given change in temperature at constant volume, approaches a well-defined, finite, positive value.\n\nBased on these thermodynamic properties, which experimental path is more controllable for studying the fluid near its critical point, and what is the correct physical reasoning?\n\nA. Path B is more controllable because the divergence of $\\kappa_T$ means that even a small change in pressure produces a large, easily measurable change in volume.\n\nB. Path A is more controllable because the finite value of $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$ ensures that the system's pressure responds predictably and moderately to small fluctuations in temperature.\n\nC. Both paths are equally difficult to control because any approach to the critical point is characterized by divergent fluctuations, making stable measurements impossible.\n\nD. Path A is more controllable because modern thermostats allow for more precise control over temperature than manometers allow for pressure.\n\nE. Path B is more controllable because keeping the temperature fixed at exactly $T_c$ is the most important factor, and any instabilities in volume can be managed by the piston.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which of two experimental paths is more stable and controllable for studying a fluid near its critical point. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the physical meaning of the thermodynamic derivatives provided and how their behavior (diverging vs. finite) affects experimental stability.\n\nLet's analyze each path separately.\n\n**Path A: The Isochoric Path**\nIn this approach, the volume $V$ is held constant at the critical volume $V_c$, and the temperature $T$ is the control parameter. We are interested in how the system's pressure $P$ responds to small, unintentional variations in temperature $\\Delta T$ around the target temperature $T_c$. This response is governed by the partial derivative $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$.\n\nFor small deviations, the change in pressure $\\Delta P$ can be approximated by:\n$$ \\Delta P \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V \\Delta T $$\nThe problem states that at the critical point, $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$ approaches a finite, positive value. Let's call this value $C$. So, near the critical point, $\\Delta P \\approx C \\cdot \\Delta T$. Because $C$ is a finite number, a small error in controlling the temperature, $\\Delta T$, will lead to a correspondingly small and predictable change in the pressure, $\\Delta P$. The system does not exhibit an explosive response. This indicates that the system is stable and experimentally controllable along this path.\n\n**Path B: The Isothermal Path**\nIn this approach, the temperature $T$ is held constant at the critical temperature $T_c$, and the pressure $P$ is the control parameter. We are interested in how the system's volume $V$ responds to small variations in pressure $\\Delta P$ around the target pressure $P_c$. This response is governed by the partial derivative $\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_T$.\n\nFor small deviations, the change in volume $\\Delta V$ can be approximated by:\n$$ \\Delta V \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_T \\Delta P $$\nThe problem provides information about the isothermal compressibility, $\\kappa_T = -\\frac{1}{V}\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_T$. We are told that $\\kappa_T$ diverges to infinity at the critical point. Since the volume $V$ at the critical point is the finite critical volume $V_c$, the divergence of $\\kappa_T$ implies that the derivative $\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_T$ must diverge to negative infinity.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_T = -V \\kappa_T \\to -\\infty \\quad \\text{as} \\quad (T, P) \\to (T_c, P_c) $$\nThis divergence has a dramatic consequence for experimental control. It means that even an infinitesimally small error in setting the pressure, $\\Delta P$, will cause an extremely large, essentially uncontrollable change in the volume, $\\Delta V$. The system is hypersensitive to pressure changes. Physically, the substance will fluctuate wildly between the liquid and gas phases, making it impossible to maintain a stable state at or near the critical volume. This path is therefore experimentally unstable and very difficult to control.\n\n**Conclusion**\nComparing the two paths, Path A (isochoric) is characterized by a finite response function, leading to stability and control. Path B (isothermal) is characterized by a divergent response function, leading to instability and a loss of control. Therefore, the isochoric path of controlling temperature at a fixed volume is the superior experimental method.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n*   A. This is incorrect. While the change in volume is large, this hypersensitivity is precisely what makes the experiment uncontrollable, not \"easy to measure\" in a stable sense.\n*   B. This is correct. The finite value of $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$ is the mathematical expression of experimental stability and predictability for the isochoric path.\n*   C. This is incorrect. While fluctuations are a hallmark of the critical point, not all response functions diverge. The finite nature of $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$ provides a stable path to approach it.\n*   D. This is a distractor. The choice is not based on general lab equipment precision but on the fundamental thermodynamic properties of the substance at the critical point. The thermodynamic instability in Path B would overwhelm any gains in instrument precision.\n*   E. This is incorrect. The instability in volume is the central problem, and a \"piston\" cannot \"manage\" a divergent response. It would be subject to massive, uncontrollable movements.\n\nThe correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1851910"}, {"introduction": "The dramatic cloudiness of critical opalescence signifies that the total amount of scattered light intensifies as we approach the critical temperature $T_c$.

This phenomenon, characterized by the fluid becoming turbid and scattering light intensely, is a result of large-scale density fluctuations. The setup involves a laser beam passing through a transparent cell containing the fluid, and a detector measuring the total scattered light intensity $I_s$.\n\nThe theoretical framework for this experiment is based on the following established relationships:\n\n1.  The total scattered light intensity $I_s$ is directly proportional to the mean square fluctuation in the number of particles, $\\langle (\\Delta N)^2 \\rangle$, within a small, fixed observation volume $V$. This can be written as $I_s = K \\langle (\\Delta N)^2 \\rangle$, where $K$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the optical properties of the fluid and the experimental geometry.\n\n2.  The fluctuation-dissipation theorem connects the particle number fluctuations to the fluid's thermodynamic properties. For a fluid at temperature $T$ with an average of $\\langle N \\rangle$ particles in volume $V$, the relationship is $\\langle (\\Delta N)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle N \\rangle k_B T}{V} \\kappa_T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\kappa_T$ is the isothermal compressibility.\n\n3.  Near the critical point, the isothermal compressibility diverges following a power law behavior: $\\kappa_T = C |T - T_c|^{-\\gamma}$, where $C$ is a fluid-dependent constant and $\\gamma$ is the universal critical exponent for isothermal compressibility.\n\nThe physicist performs two measurements very close to the critical temperature. At a temperature $T_1$, corresponding to a temperature difference $\\Delta T_1 = |T_1 - T_c|$, the measured intensity is $I_1$. A second measurement is taken at temperature $T_2$, corresponding to a temperature difference $\\Delta T_2 = |T_2 - T_c|$, yielding an intensity of $I_2$.\n\nFor temperatures very close to the critical point, it is an excellent approximation to consider the absolute temperature $T$ in the fluctuation-dissipation relation as constant and equal to $T_c$, since its variation is negligible compared to the divergent behavior of $\\kappa_T$.\n\nBased on this information, derive an expression for the intensity $I_2$ in terms of $I_1$, $\\Delta T_1$, $\\Delta T_2$, and the critical exponent $\\gamma$.", "solution": "The total scattered light intensity is proportional to the mean square particle-number fluctuation, so\n$$\nI_{s}=K\\langle(\\Delta N)^{2}\\rangle.\n$$\nBy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem,\n$$\n\\langle(\\Delta N)^{2}\\rangle=\\frac{\\langle N\\rangle k_{B}T}{V}\\,\\kappa_{T}.\n$$\nCombining these gives\n$$\nI_{s}=K\\,\\frac{\\langle N\\rangle k_{B}T}{V}\\,\\kappa_{T}.\n$$\nNear the critical point, the isothermal compressibility follows the power law\n$$\n\\kappa_{T}=C\\,|T-T_{c}|^{-\\gamma}=C\\,(\\Delta T)^{-\\gamma}.\n$$\nUsing the stated approximation that $T$ in the prefactor can be taken as constant and equal to $T_{c}$ for temperatures very close to the critical point, and noting that $K$, $C$, $V$, and the measurement geometry are fixed, we can define a constant\n$$\nA=K\\,C\\,\\frac{\\langle N\\rangle k_{B}T_{c}}{V},\n$$\nso that\n$$\nI_{s}=A\\,(\\Delta T)^{-\\gamma}.\n$$\nEvaluating at the two temperatures,\n$$\nI_{1}=A\\,(\\Delta T_{1})^{-\\gamma},\\qquad I_{2}=A\\,(\\Delta T_{2})^{-\\gamma}.\n$$\nTaking the ratio eliminates $A$:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}}=\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_{2}}{\\Delta T_{1}}\\right)^{-\\gamma}=\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_{1}}{\\Delta T_{2}}\\right)^{\\gamma}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nI_{2}=I_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_{1}}{\\Delta T_{2}}\\right)^{\\gamma}.\n$$\nThis relation holds regardless of whether the temperatures approach $T_{c}$ from above or below because $\\Delta T_{i}=|T_{i}-T_{c}|$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{I_{2}=I_{1}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta T_{1}}{\\Delta T_{2}}\\right)^{\\gamma}}$$", "id": "1851914"}, {"introduction": "The phenomenon of critical opalescence involves more than just a large amount of scattering; the spatial pattern of the scattered light reveals crucial information about the fluid's microscopic state.
