This process is governed by a fundamental trade-off: the thermodynamic driving force that favors the new, more stable phase, and the kinetic barrier that opposes the atomic rearrangement needed to form it. This practice problem invites you to explore how changing the temperature, specifically the degree of undercooling ($\\Delta T$), shifts this delicate balance, providing a crucial intuition for controlling phase transformations [@problem_id:1890528].", "problem": "In the study of homogeneous nucleation during a liquid-to-solid phase transformation, a pure liquid material is cooled below its equilibrium melting temperature, $T_m$. This process is known as undercooling, and the degree of undercooling is defined as $\\Delta T = T_m - T$, where $T$ is the actual temperature of the liquid. The formation of a stable solid nucleus within the undercooled liquid depends on a balance between two competing factors: the thermodynamic driving force, which favors the transformation to the lower-energy solid phase, and the kinetic barrier, which relates to the atomic motion required to form the new crystal structure.\n\nConsider a scenario where the degree of undercooling, $\\Delta T$, is increased. How does this increase in $\\Delta T$ qualitatively affect the magnitude of the thermodynamic driving force for nucleation and the kinetic barrier to the atomic transport required for the process?\n\nA. The thermodynamic driving force increases, and the kinetic barrier increases.\n\nB. The thermodynamic driving force increases, and the kinetic barrier decreases.\n\nC. The thermodynamic driving force decreases, and the kinetic barrier increases.\n\nD. The thermodynamic driving force decreases, and the kinetic barrier decreases.\n\nE. The thermodynamic driving force remains unchanged, while the kinetic barrier increases.", "solution": "Define the undercooling as $\\Delta T = T_{m} - T$ with $T<T_{m}$, so increasing $\\Delta T$ means decreasing $T$.\n\nThermodynamic driving force: For solidification, the molar Gibbs free energy change between solid and liquid for small undercooling can be linearized as\n$$\n\\Delta g_{\\text{mol}}(T) \\approx -\\Delta h_{f}\\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{m}},\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta h_{f}$ is the molar enthalpy of fusion and the negative sign indicates the solid is thermodynamically favored. Hence the magnitude of the driving force is\n$$\n|\\Delta g_{\\text{mol}}| \\approx \\Delta h_{f}\\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{m}},\n$$\nwhich is an increasing function of $\\Delta T$. Therefore, increasing $\\Delta T$ increases the thermodynamic driving force.\n\nKinetic barrier to atomic transport: Atomic mobility (e.g., diffusivity) typically follows an Arrhenius form\n$$\nD(T) = D_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{Q}{k_{B}T}\\right),\n$$\nwith activation energy $Q>0$.

Lower atomic mobility means a higher kinetic hindrance to the necessary atomic transport; equivalently, the effective kinetic barrier relative to available thermal energy increases with increasing $\\Delta T$.\n\nConclusion: Increasing $\\Delta T$ increases the thermodynamic driving force and increases the kinetic barrier to atomic transport.
