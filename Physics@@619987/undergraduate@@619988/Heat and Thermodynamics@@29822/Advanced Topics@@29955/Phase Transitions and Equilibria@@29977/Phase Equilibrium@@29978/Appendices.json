It exhibits an unusual property: at its normal melting point, its liquid phase is denser than its solid phase. A sample of pure, solid Galloxane is placed in a high-pressure piston-cylinder apparatus. The pressure and temperature are carefully adjusted until the system reaches a state where the solid and liquid phases coexist in stable equilibrium. The experimenter then quasi-statically increases the external pressure on the system, while allowing heat to be exchanged with the surroundings as needed to maintain the phase equilibrium.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the new equilibrium temperature (i.e., the new melting point) of Galloxane compared to the original one?\n\nA) The new melting point is higher than the original melting point.\n\nB) The new melting point is lower than the original melting point.\n\nC) The new melting point is the same as the original melting point.\n\nD) The system will transition entirely into the solid phase regardless of temperature changes.\n\nE) The system will transition entirely into the liquid phase regardless of temperature changes.", "solution": "At solid-liquid coexistence for a single-component system, the intensive equilibrium condition is equality of chemical potentials, $\\mu^{\\text{s}}=\\mu^{\\ell}$.
