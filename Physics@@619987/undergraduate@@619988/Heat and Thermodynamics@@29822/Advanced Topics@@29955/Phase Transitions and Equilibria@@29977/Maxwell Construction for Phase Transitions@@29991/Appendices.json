Its behavior is represented on a Pressure-Volume (P-V) diagram. As the volume of the system is increased from a small value, the pressure follows a continuous path along an isotherm. Let's label several points along this specific isotherm:\n\n*   The path starts at point `A` in the high-pressure, low-volume liquid phase.\n*   As volume increases, the pressure drops along the curve to a point `B`.\n*   Continuing to increase the volume from `B`, the pressure reaches a local minimum at point `C`.\n*   From `C`, the pressure rises to a local maximum at point `D`.\n*   Beyond `D`, the pressure again falls as volume increases, passing through a point `E` on its way to the low-pressure, high-volume gas phase.\n\nThe Maxwell construction for this isotherm introduces a horizontal line of constant pressure, $P_{vap}$, which represents the stable two-phase (liquid-vapor) coexistence region. This line connects point `B` on the liquid-like portion of the curve to point `E` on the vapor-like portion. This construction is defined such that the area enclosed by the path `B-C-D-E-B` has a net value of zero (i.e., the area of the lobe below the line `BE` is equal to the area of the lobe above it).\n\nIf the liquid is expanded carefully, it can exist in a metastable state before it begins to boil.
