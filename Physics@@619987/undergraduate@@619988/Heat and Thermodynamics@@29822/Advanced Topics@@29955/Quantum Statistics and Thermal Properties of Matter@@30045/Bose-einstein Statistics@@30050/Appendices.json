Mastering this combinatorial foundation is the first step toward understanding the unique macroscopic properties of Bose gases.

The system consists of 3 identical and indistinguishable bosonic particles. These particles are to be distributed among 4 distinct and discrete energy levels. A microstate of the system is a specific arrangement of the particles in these energy levels. For example, one possible microstate is having all 3 particles in the first energy level and the other three levels empty. Another microstate is having one particle in each of the first three levels and the fourth level empty. Determine the total number of distinct microstates possible for this system.", "solution": "Because the particles are identical bosons and the energy levels are distinct, a microstate is completely specified by the occupation numbers of the levels.
