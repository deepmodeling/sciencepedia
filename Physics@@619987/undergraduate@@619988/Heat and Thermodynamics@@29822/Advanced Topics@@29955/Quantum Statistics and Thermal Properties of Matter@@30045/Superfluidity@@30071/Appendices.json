The behavior of the superfluid is described by a macroscopic wave function. The requirement that this wave function be single-valued imposes a strict condition on the fluid's velocity field. For a vortex line, the circulation, defined as the line integral of the velocity field around a closed loop enclosing the vortex, is quantized. This means the circulation can only take on discrete values that are integer multiples of a fundamental unit called the quantum of circulation, denoted by $\\kappa$.
