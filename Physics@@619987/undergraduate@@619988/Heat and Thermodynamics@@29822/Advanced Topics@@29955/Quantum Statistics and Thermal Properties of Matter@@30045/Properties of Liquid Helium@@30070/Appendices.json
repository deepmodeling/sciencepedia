However, this remarkable property breaks down if the flow velocity exceeds a certain critical velocity, $v_c$. The physical mechanism that determines $v_c$ depends on the geometry of the flow channel.\n\nFirst, consider the superflow in a wide, bulk channel. In this scenario, the critical velocity is determined by the Landau criterion, which states that superfluidity breaks down when it becomes energetically favorable to create elementary excitations in the fluid. For $^4$He, the most relevant excitations are rotons. The energy-momentum dispersion relation for rotons near their energy minimum is well-approximated by a parabolic form: $\\epsilon(p) = \\Delta + \\frac{(p - p_0)^2}{2\\mu}$, where $\\Delta$ is the roton energy gap, $p_0$ is the momentum corresponding to the minimum, and $\\mu$ is the roton effective mass. The Landau critical velocity, $v_L$, corresponds to the minimum value of the ratio $\\epsilon(p)/p$.
