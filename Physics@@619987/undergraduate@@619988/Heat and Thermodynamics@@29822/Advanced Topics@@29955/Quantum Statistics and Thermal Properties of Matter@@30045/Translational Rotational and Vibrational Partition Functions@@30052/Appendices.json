As the molecule rotates, the internuclear bond stretches due to centrifugal forces. This effect modifies the idealized rotational energy levels. For such a molecule, the rotational energy levels are given by the expression:\n$$E_J = BJ(J+1) - DJ^2(J+1)^2$$\nHere, $J$ is the rotational quantum number which can take integer values $J = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.

The system is in the high-temperature limit, where the thermal energy is much larger than the rotational energy spacing, i.e., $k_B T \\gg B$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.
