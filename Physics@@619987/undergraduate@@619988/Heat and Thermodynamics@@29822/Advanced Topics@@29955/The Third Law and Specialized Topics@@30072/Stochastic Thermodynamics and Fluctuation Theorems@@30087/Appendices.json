Consider a simplified one-dimensional model of such a system. A particle is held in a harmonic potential trap described by $U(x, t) = \\frac{1}{2}K(x - x_0(t))^2$, where $K$ is the trap stiffness and $x_0(t)$ is the time-dependent center of the trap, which can be controlled externally. The particle is immersed in a viscous fluid, and its dynamics are in the overdamped regime.\n\nAn experiment requires moving the trap center from an initial position $x_0(0) = A$ to a final position $x_0(\\tau) = B$ over a fixed duration $\\tau$.
