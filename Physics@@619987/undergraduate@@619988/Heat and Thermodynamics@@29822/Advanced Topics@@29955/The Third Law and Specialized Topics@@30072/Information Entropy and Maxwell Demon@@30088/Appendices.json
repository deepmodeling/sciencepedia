This reporter acts like a simple memory bit, having two possible configurations, which we label '0' and '1'. The reporter molecule attempts to record the state of the switch, but the process is noisy. The conditional probabilities for the reporter's configuration, given the switch's state, are as follows:\n- Given the switch is 'active', the reporter shows '1' with probability $P(1|\\text{active}) = 0.9$ and '0' with probability $P(0|\\text{active}) = 0.1$.\n- Given the switch is 'inactive', the reporter shows '0' with probability $P(0|\\text{inactive}) = 0.8$ and '1' with probability $P(1|\\text{inactive}) = 0.2$.\n\nThe total system consists of the switch and its coupled reporter molecule.
