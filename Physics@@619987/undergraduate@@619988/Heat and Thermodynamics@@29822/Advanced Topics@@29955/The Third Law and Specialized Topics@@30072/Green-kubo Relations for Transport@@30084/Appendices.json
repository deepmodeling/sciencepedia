In simulations of dense liquids, the VACF often dips into negative values before decaying to zero. This exercise challenges you to interpret this feature, which is a signature of the \"cage effect,\" where a particle is temporarily trapped and repelled by its neighbors. [@problem_id:1864525]", "problem": "A physicist is analyzing the results of a molecular dynamics simulation of a simple dense liquid. A key quantity of interest is the Velocity Autocorrelation Function (VACF), which provides insight into the microscopic motion of individual particles. The VACF, denoted as $C_v(t)$, is defined as:\n$$C_v(t) = \\langle \\vec{v}(t_0) \\cdot \\vec{v}(t_0 + t) \\rangle$$\nwhere $\\vec{v}(t)$ is the velocity of a given particle at time $t$, and the angle brackets $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ represent an average over all particles and multiple starting times $t_0$.\n\nUpon plotting the computed data, the physicist observes that $C_v(t)$ starts at a maximum positive value at $t=0$, decreases, and then becomes negative for a short interval of time before eventually approaching zero as $t$ becomes large.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical explanation for the observed negative region of the VACF?\n\nA. The negative region indicates that the particle permanently reverses its direction of motion and travels back to its original position.\n\nB. The negative region signifies that a particle, after moving a short distance, is likely to collide with and be repelled by its surrounding neighbors, causing a statistical preference for its velocity to be in a direction opposite to its initial velocity.\n\nC. The negative region corresponds to a period where the particle's kinetic energy becomes negative, a non-classical effect that occurs in dense fluids.\n\nD. The negative region is a non-physical artifact of the computer simulation, suggesting that the chosen numerical integration time-step was too large and caused energy conservation to be violated.\n\nE. The negative region implies that the dominant long-range attractive forces between particles are pulling the particle back, causing its velocity to reverse.", "solution": "The velocity autocorrelation function is defined by $C_{v}(t)=\\langle \\vec{v}(t_{0})\\cdot \\vec{v}(t_{0}+t)\\rangle$. At $t=0$, one has $C_{v}(0)=\\langle \\vec{v}(t_{0})\\cdot \\vec{v}(t_{0})\\rangle=\\langle v^{2}\\rangle>0$ by equipartition. Time-reversal symmetry in equilibrium implies $C_{v}(t)=C_{v}(-t)$, so $\\left.\\frac{dC_{v}}{dt}\\right|_{t=0}=0$ and the initial decay is not instantaneous but proceeds smoothly from its maximum.\n\nA negative region $C_{v}(t)<0$ at intermediate times means that, on average, the velocity at time $t$ is anti-correlated with the initial velocity: $\\langle \\vec{v}(t_{0})\\cdot \\vec{v}(t_{0}+t)\\rangle<0$ implies that the angle between $\\vec{v}(t_{0})$ and $\\vec{v}(t_{0}+t)$ is, on average, obtuse. This does not imply negative kinetic energy, since the kinetic energy is $K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\\ge 0$ at all times for classical particles; the sign of $C_{v}(t)$ concerns the correlation of directions and the component of $\\vec{v}(t_{0}+t)$ along $\\vec{v}(t_{0})$, not the magnitude $v^{2}$.\n\nIn a dense liquid, the dominant microscopic mechanism producing such an anticorrelation is the cage effect and backscattering due to short-range repulsive interactions with neighboring particles. By Newton’s second law, $\\dot{\\vec{v}}(t)=\\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{j}\\vec{F}_{ij}(t)$, and when a particle initially moves into its cage, it encounters repulsive forces $-\\nabla U(r)$ from neighbors that, on average, act opposite to its direction of motion. This leads to a transient reversal of the velocity component along its initial direction, producing $C_{v}(t)<0$ for a short time. This effect is well known both in hard-sphere fluids (purely repulsive) and in simple liquids like Lennard-Jones systems; thus it does not require long-range attractions and is not a numerical artifact. At long times, hydrodynamic relaxation and momentum diffusion cause $C_{v}(t)\\to 0$, consistent with the observed decay.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because the reversal is not permanent; the process is statistical and transient, and the particle does not systematically travel back to its original position.\n- Option C is incorrect because $K=\\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ cannot be negative in classical mechanics; the negative VACF concerns directional correlation, not energy sign.\n- Option D is incorrect because a negative intermediate-time VACF is a robust, physically expected feature in dense liquids and appears even with accurate integrators and small time steps.\n- Option E is misleading because the negative region arises primarily from short-range repulsive caging and backscattering; it occurs even in systems without long-range attractions.\n\nHence, the most accurate explanation is that short-time collisions with surrounding neighbors produce a statistical preference for velocity opposite to the initial direction, i.e., the caging/backscattering mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1864525"}, {"introduction": "This final practice brings the theory full circle by applying it to a quantitative calculation.
