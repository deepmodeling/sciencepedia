These fluxes are driven by corresponding generalized thermodynamic forces, $X_1, X_2, X_3$.\n\nIn the linear regime close to equilibrium, the relationship between the fluxes and forces can be described by a set of phenomenological equations:\n$$J_1 = L_{11} X_1 + L_{12} X_2 + L_{13} X_3$$\n$$J_2 = L_{21} X_1 + L_{22} X_2 + L_{23} X_3$$\n$$J_3 = L_{31} X_1 + L_{32} X_2 + L_{33} X_3$$\nHere, the coefficients $L_{ij}$ are the phenomenological transport coefficients that quantify the strength of the interactions between the different processes.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of irreversible thermodynamics, certain relationships between these coefficients must hold true universally, irrespective of the material composition or specific geometry of the device.

The fluid consists of a neutral, but electrically polarizable, macromolecule solute suspended in a stationary solvent. A key experimental observation is that applying a static, uniform electric field across a sample of this fluid induces a steady-state mass flux of the neutral solute. This effect is a form of coupled transport.\n\nLet us formalize the thermodynamic fluxes and forces relevant to this system. The primary fluxes of interest are the mass flux of the solute, $\\vec{J}_m$, and the electric current density, $\\vec{J}_e$. The corresponding thermodynamic driving forces are derived from gradients of thermodynamic potentials. For this isothermal system, the main forces are the \"diffusive force,\" which is proportional to the negative concentration gradient of the solute ($-\\nabla c$), and the \"electric force,\" which is the electric field $\\vec{E}$ itself (equal to the negative gradient of the electric potential, $-\\nabla \\phi$).\n\nThe observed phenomenon is the coupling where the electric force ($\\vec{E}$) drives a mass flux ($\\vec{J}_m$).
