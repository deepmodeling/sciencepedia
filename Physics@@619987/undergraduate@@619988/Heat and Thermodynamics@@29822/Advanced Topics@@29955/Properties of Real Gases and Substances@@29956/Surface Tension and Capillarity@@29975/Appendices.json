This advanced problem challenges you to synthesize your knowledge by modeling a more complex scenario: capillary rise in a sealed tube. Here, the rising liquid not only works against gravity but also compresses a column of trapped air. To find the final equilibrium height, you must simultaneously apply the principles of capillarity (Laplace pressure), hydrostatics, and gas laws (Boyle's Law), providing excellent practice in integrated problem-solving [@problem_id:2216049].", "problem": "A thin vertical glass capillary tube of internal radius $r$ and length greater than $L$ is sealed at its top end. The tube is initially held in the air, trapping a column of air of length $L$ at atmospheric pressure, $P_{atm}$.

Due to capillary action, the liquid rises into the tube, compressing the trapped air column.\n\nAssume the liquid has a density $\\rho$ and a surface tension $\\gamma$.

The initial volume of the trapped air is $V_i = A L$, where $A = \\pi r^2$ is the cross-sectional area of the capillary tube.\n\nWhen the liquid rises to a height $h$ inside the tube, the length of the trapped air column is reduced to $L' = L - h$. The new volume of the trapped air is $V_f = A(L - h)$. Let the pressure of the trapped air at this new equilibrium be $P_{air}$.\n\nSince the temperature is constant, we can apply Boyle's Law to the trapped air:\n$$P_i V_i = P_f V_f$$\n$$P_{atm} (A L) = P_{air} (A (L-h))$$\nSolving for $P_{air}$, we get:\n$$P_{air} = P_{atm} \\frac{L}{L - h}$$\n\nNow, let's establish the pressure balance at equilibrium. We will balance the pressures at the level of the free liquid surface outside the capillary.\n\nThe pressure at this level outside the tube is simply the atmospheric pressure, $P_{out} = P_{atm}$.\n\nTo find the pressure at this same level inside the tube, $P_{in}$, we must consider three contributions: the pressure of the trapped air, the pressure change across the curved meniscus (Laplace pressure), and the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid column.\n\nThe pressure just above the liquid meniscus inside the tube is the pressure of the trapped air, $P_{air}$.\nThe pressure changes across the meniscus due to surface tension. The pressure just below the meniscus, $P_{below}$, is related to the pressure just above it by the Laplace pressure formula, $\\Delta P_{cap} = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r}$.
