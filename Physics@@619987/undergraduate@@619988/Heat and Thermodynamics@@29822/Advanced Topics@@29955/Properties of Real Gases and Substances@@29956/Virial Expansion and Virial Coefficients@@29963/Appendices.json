The second virial coefficient, $B_2(T)$, provides the first-order correction to the ideal gas law and is primarily determined by pairwise intermolecular interactions.\n\nConsider gaseous nitrogen ($\\text{N}_2$) and water vapor ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) at a temperature of $T=400$ K.

For attractive interactions where $u(r)0$ over a region of $r$, one has $f(r)0$ in that region, which contributes a positive integral; the overall prefactor then yields a negative contribution to $B_{2}(T)$. Conversely, for repulsive interactions where $u(r)0$ (notably at short range), $f(r)0$, contributing positively to $B_{2}(T)$. Therefore, stronger net attractions at a given $T$ make $B_{2}(T)$ more negative, while stronger effective repulsions make it more positive.\n\nComparing substances at the same temperature $T=400$ K:\n- Nitrogen, $\\text{N}_2$, is nonpolar with interactions dominated by weak dispersion forces and a quadrupole–quadrupole contribution.

This directly rules out arguments based on molar mass (which does not set $B_{2}$ independently of the interaction potential), claims that permanent dipoles increase short-range repulsion (they enhance attractions), or appeals to “increased excluded volume” due to clustering near condensation (clustering reflects attractions, which decrease $B_{2}$). The option asserting near-ideality and near-equality at $400$ K is also inconsistent with the much stronger attractive interactions in water vapor.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that $B_{2,\\text{N}_{2}} > B_{2,\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}$ because water’s strong polar and hydrogen-bonding attractions make its second virial coefficient more negative than that of nitrogen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1904726"}, {"introduction": "Building on a conceptual understanding of how intermolecular forces shape the second virial coefficient, this next exercise [@problem_id:1904733] provides direct, hands-on calculation experience.
