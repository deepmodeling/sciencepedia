Express your answer in meters, rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the radius of a single argon atom, modeled as a hard sphere, using the given van der Waals parameter $b$.\n\nThe parameter $b$ represents the excluded volume per mole of gas. This is related to, but not equal to, the total volume of the atoms themselves. Let us denote the radius of a single atom as $r$ and its volume as $V_{\\text{atom}}$. Assuming the atom is a sphere, its volume is:\n$$V_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\n\nThe concept of \"excluded volume\" arises from the fact that the center of one atom cannot enter the space occupied by another. For two identical hard spheres of radius $r$, the minimum distance between their centers is $2r$. Thus, the center of one atom is excluded from a sphere of radius $2r$ centered on the other atom. The volume of this sphere of exclusion for a pair of atoms is:\n$$V_{\\text{excluded, pair}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi(2r)^3 = 8 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) = 8V_{\\text{atom}}$$\n\nThis excluded volume is associated with a pair of particles. A common, simplified argument attributes half of this volume to each particle in the pair, leading to an excluded volume per particle of $4V_{\\text{atom}}$. More rigorously, the second virial coefficient for a hard-sphere gas is found to be $4V_{\\text{atom}}$, and the van der Waals parameter $b$ is the molar equivalent of this quantity.\n\nTherefore, the excluded volume per particle is four times the physical volume of a single atom. To find the excluded volume per mole, $b$, we multiply the excluded volume per particle by Avogadro's number, $N_A$:\n$$b = N_A \\times (4 V_{\\text{atom}})$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the volume of a single atom, $V_{\\text{atom}}$, we get:\n$$b = 4 N_A \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right)$$\n$$b = \\frac{16}{3} \\pi N_A r^3$$\n\nOur goal is to find the radius $r$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $r^3$:\n$$r^3 = \\frac{3b}{16 \\pi N_A}$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $r$ by taking the cube root of both sides:\n$$r = \\left( \\frac{3b}{16 \\pi N_A} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression: $b = 3.22 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^3\\text{/mol}$ and $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}$.\n$$r = \\left( \\frac{3 \\times (3.22 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^3\\text{/mol})}{16 \\pi (6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1})} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n$$r = \\left( \\frac{9.66 \\times 10^{-5}}{16 \\pi \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23}} \\right)^{1/3} \\text{m}$$\n\nLet's evaluate the denominator:\n$$16 \\pi \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\approx 16 \\times 3.14159 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\approx 3.0267 \\times 10^{25}$$\nSo the expression for the radius becomes:\n$$r \\approx \\left( \\frac{9.66 \\times 10^{-5}}{3.0267 \\times 10^{25}} \\right)^{1/3} \\text{m}$$\n$$r \\approx \\left( 3.1917 \\times 10^{-30} \\right)^{1/3} \\text{m}$$\n$$r \\approx (3.1917)^{1/3} \\times 10^{-10} \\text{m}$$\n\nCalculating the cube root:\n$$(3.1917)^{1/3} \\approx 1.472$$\nSo, the estimated radius is:\n$$r \\approx 1.472 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n$$r \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-10} \\text{ m}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.5 \\times 10^{-10}}$$", "id": "1852594"}, {"introduction": "While parameters like $a$ and $b$ in the van der Waals equation provide a more realistic model, they must be determined for each specific substance.
