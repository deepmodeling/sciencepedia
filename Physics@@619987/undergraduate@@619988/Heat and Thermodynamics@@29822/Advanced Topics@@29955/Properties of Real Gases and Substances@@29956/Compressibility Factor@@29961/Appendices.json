The first system contains an ideal gas, and the second contains a real gas. Both systems are initially at the same temperature $T$ and occupy the same initial volume $V_i$. Both gases are then subjected to a quasi-static, isothermal compression until they reach the same final volume $V_f$, where $V_f  V_i$.\n\nThe behavior of the real gas can be described by its compressibility factor, $Z$, defined as $Z = \\frac{PV}{nRT}$, where $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the volume, $n$ is the number of moles, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

The relationship cannot be determined without the specific equation of state for the real gas.", "solution": "The work done on a gas during a quasi-static volume change from an initial volume $V_i$ to a final volume $V_f$ is given by the integral:\n$$W = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P \\, dV$$\nSince the process is a compression, $V_f  V_i$, which means the differential $dV$ is negative along the integration path. The negative sign in the formula ensures that the work done *on* the system is positive for compression. We need to compare this quantity for the ideal gas and the real gas.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the ideal gas case. For one mole ($n=1$) of an ideal gas, the equation of state is $P_{\\text{ideal}}V = RT$. The pressure is therefore a function of volume:\n$$P_{\\text{ideal}}(V) = \\frac{RT}{V}$$\nThe work done on the ideal gas is:\n$$W_{\\text{ideal}} = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P_{\\text{ideal}}(V) \\, dV = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} \\frac{RT}{V} \\, dV$$\nSince the process is isothermal, $T$ is constant. Evaluating the integral gives:\n$$W_{\\text{ideal}} = -RT \\left[ \\ln(V) \\right]_{V_i}^{V_f} = -RT (\\ln(V_f) - \\ln(V_i)) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_i}{V_f}\\right)$$\nSince $V_i > V_f$, the argument of the logarithm is greater than 1, so $W_{\\text{ideal}}$ is a positive value, as expected for work done on the system during compression.\n\nNext, let's analyze the real gas case. The problem provides the compressibility factor $Z = \\frac{PV}{RT}$, for one mole ($n=1$) of the real gas. We can express the pressure of the real gas, $P_{\\text{real}}$, as a function of volume:\n$$P_{\\text{real}}(V) = \\frac{ZRT}{V}$$\nThe problem states that for this real gas, $Z  1$ throughout the entire compression process.\n\nNow we can compare the pressures of the two gases at any given volume $V$ (and at the constant temperature $T$).\n$$P_{\\text{ideal}}(V) = \\frac{RT}{V}$$\n$$P_{\\text{real}}(V) = Z \\frac{RT}{V}$$\nSince $Z  1$, it directly follows that:\n$$P_{\\text{real}}(V)  P_{\\text{ideal}}(V)$$\nThis inequality holds for every volume $V$ between $V_i$ and $V_f$. This means that at any point during the compression, the real gas exerts a lower pressure than an ideal gas would at the same volume and temperature. Physically, this is because the attractive intermolecular forces (which are dominant when $Z1$) help in pulling the gas molecules together, reducing the external pressure needed to confine them to a given volume.\n\nFinally, we compare the work done.\n$$W_{\\text{ideal}} = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P_{\\text{ideal}}(V) \\, dV$$\n$$W_{\\text{real}} = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P_{\\text{real}}(V) \\, dV$$\nTo compare the integrals, we can rewrite them as definite integrals over a positive interval:\n$$W = \\int_{V_f}^{V_i} P(V) \\, dV$$\nSo we are comparing $W_{\\text{ideal}} = \\int_{V_f}^{V_i} P_{\\text{ideal}}(V) \\, dV$ and $W_{\\text{real}} = \\int_{V_f}^{V_i} P_{\\text{real}}(V) \\, dV$.\n\nSince the integrand $P_{\\text{real}}(V)$ is strictly less than the integrand $P_{\\text{ideal}}(V)$ for all $V$ in the integration interval $[V_f, V_i]$, the value of the integral for the real gas must be smaller than the value of the integral for the ideal gas.\n$$\\int_{V_f}^{V_i} P_{\\text{real}}(V) \\, dV  \\int_{V_f}^{V_i} P_{\\text{ideal}}(V) \\, dV$$\nTherefore, we conclude that:\n$$W_{\\text{real}}  W_{\\text{ideal}}$$\nLess work is required to compress the real gas compared to the ideal gas.
