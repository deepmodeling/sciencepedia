Neutral buoyancy occurs when the total weight of the balloon system is equal to the buoyant force acting on it.\n\nFirst, let's identify the forces. The buoyant force, $F_B$, is directed upward and is equal to the weight of the ambient air displaced by the balloon's volume, according to Archimedes' principle. The total weight, $W_{\\text{total}}$, is directed downward and is the sum of the weight of the balloon's envelope, the payload, and the hot air inside the balloon.\n\nThe condition for neutral buoyancy is:\n$$F_B = W_{\\text{total}}$$\n\nThe buoyant force is given by:\n$$F_B = m_{\\text{ambient\\_air}} g = \\rho_{\\text{ambient}} V g$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\text{ambient}}$ is the density of the ambient air, $V$ is the volume of the balloon, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe total weight is the sum of three components:\n$$W_{\\text{total}} = W_{\\text{env}} + W_{\\text{payload}} + W_{\\text{hot\\_air}}$$\n$$W_{\\text{total}} = m_{\\text{env}} g + m_{\\text{payload}} g + m_{\\text{hot\\_air}} g$$\n$$W_{\\text{total}} = (m_{\\text{env}} + m_{\\text{payload}} + \\rho_{\\text{hot}} V) g$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\text{hot}}$ is the density of the hot air inside the balloon.\n\nSetting $F_B = W_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{ambient}} V g = (m_{\\text{env}} + m_{\\text{payload}} + \\rho_{\\text{hot}} V) g$$\nThe acceleration due to gravity, $g$, cancels from both sides:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{ambient}} V = m_{\\text{env}} + m_{\\text{payload}} + \\rho_{\\text{hot}} V$$\n\nTo solve for the temperature $T_{\\text{hot}}$, we need to relate the densities $\\rho_{\\text{ambient}}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{hot}}$ to their respective temperatures.
