This foundational exercise illustrates this very principle. By comparing the initial mixing rates of two different gases, Helium and Neon, under identical conditions of temperature and pressure, you will forge a direct link between the macroscopic phenomenon of particle flux and the microscopic property of average molecular speed [@problem_id:1855043].", "problem": "Two identical, isolated bulbs are connected by a short, narrow tube sealed by a valve. Initially, Bulb 1 is filled with pure Helium (He) gas, and Bulb 2 is filled with pure Neon (Ne) gas. Both gases are at the same initial temperature $T_0$ and the same initial pressure $P_0$. Let the molar mass of Helium be denoted by $M_{He}$ and the molar mass of Neon by $M_{Ne}$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the valve is opened, allowing the two gases to start diffusing into each other. The net particle flow, or flux, is the rate at which particles of a gas cross the junction between the bulbs (in particles per second). Assume that the initial rate of diffusion is primarily determined by the average thermal speed of the gas particles, with the diffusion coefficient being directly proportional to this speed.\n\nDetermine the ratio of the magnitude of the initial net particle flow of Helium into Bulb 2 to the magnitude of the initial net particle flow of Neon into Bulb 1. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $M_{He}$ and $M_{Ne}$.", "solution": "Let the number density of an ideal gas at pressure $P_{0}$ and temperature $T_{0}$ be $n_{0} = \\frac{P_{0}}{k_{B} T_{0}}$.

This practice focuses on Graham's Law, which elegantly states that a gas's diffusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass, $r \\propto 1/\\sqrt{M}$. You will apply this law to a practical scenario, determining the relative molecular masses of two gases from their diffusion rates, a powerful tool for analyzing unknown substances [@problem_id:1855030].", "problem": "In an environmental analysis laboratory, a researcher is studying the diffusive properties of two unidentified pollutant gases, designated Gas A and Gas B. The experiment is conducted by releasing a small amount of each gas at one end of a long, sealed tube filled with stationary air at a constant temperature and pressure. The time it takes for each gas to be detected at the other end of the tube is recorded. From these measurements, it is determined that under identical conditions, Gas A diffuses through the air four times faster than Gas B. Assuming the gases can be treated as ideal and that their diffusion rates are governed by Graham's Law, determine the ratio of the molecular mass of Gas B to the molecular mass of Gas A, denoted as $m_B/m_A$.", "solution": "Let $r_{A}$ and $r_{B}$ denote the diffusion rates of Gas A and Gas B, respectively, and let $m_{A}$ and $m_{B}$ denote their molecular masses.
