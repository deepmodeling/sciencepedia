By calculating the \"separation factor,\" a key metric in industrial processes like uranium enrichment, for both scenarios, you will discover why only the slow, molecular regime allows for the separation of isotopes and gain a deeper insight into the physical conditions that make effusion a powerful separation technique.", "problem": "Two identical, thermally-controlled chambers, Chamber 1 and Chamber 2, are part of a system designed to study gas flow phenomena. Both chambers have the same volume, are maintained at the same constant temperature $T$, and are filled with a gaseous mixture of two isotopes to the same initial total pressure. The gas can be treated as a mixture of ideal gases. Let the lighter isotope have a molar mass $M_L$ and the heavier one have a molar mass $M_H$. The initial mole fractions of the isotopes are identical in both chambers.\n\nEach chamber is connected to a perfect vacuum, but through different types of openings.\n- Chamber 1's opening is a single circular orifice. The experimental conditions are set such that the gas molecules' mean free path is much smaller than the orifice diameter. This results in a bulk, hydrodynamic flow of the gas out of the chamber.\n- Chamber 2's opening is a specialized membrane containing a vast number of microscopic pores. The total combined area of all these pores is engineered to be exactly equal to the area of the single orifice in Chamber 1. For these tiny pores, the mean free path of the gas molecules is much larger than the diameter of any individual pore, which means the gas escapes via molecular effusion.\n\nThe effectiveness of such a process for separating isotopes is quantified by the initial separation factor, $\\alpha$, defined as the ratio of the isotopic ratios inside and outside the chamber: $\\alpha = \\frac{y_L/y_H}{x_L/x_H}$. Here, $x_L$ and $x_H$ are the initial mole fractions of the light and heavy isotopes inside the chamber, and $y_L$ and $y_H$ are the mole fractions in the gas that is instantaneously escaping at time $t=0$.\n\nLet $\\alpha_1$ be the initial separation factor for Chamber 1 and $\\alpha_2$ be the initial separation factor for Chamber 2.

The separation factor $\\alpha$ is defined as $\\alpha = \\frac{y_L/y_H}{x_L/x_H}$, where $x_i$ are the mole fractions inside the chamber and $y_i$ are the mole fractions in the escaping gas. The ratio of mole fractions in the escaping gas, $y_L/y_H$, is equal to the ratio of the escape rates of the two species, $R_L/R_H$. Therefore, we can write the separation factor as $\\alpha = \\frac{R_L/R_H}{x_L/x_H}$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Chamber 1 (Hydrodynamic Flow)**\nIn Chamber 1, the flow is described as hydrodynamic. This means the gas flows out as a bulk fluid, like water from a pipe. In this regime, the gas does not separate based on the mass of its constituent molecules. The composition of the escaping gas is identical to the composition of the bulk gas inside the chamber.\nTherefore, the mole fractions in the escaping gas are the same as the mole fractions inside: $y_L = x_L$ and $y_H = x_H$.\nThe ratio of mole fractions in the escaping gas is $y_L/y_H = x_L/x_H$.\nThe separation factor for Chamber 1, $\\alpha_1$, is then:\n$$\n\\alpha_1 = \\frac{y_L/y_H}{x_L/x_H} = \\frac{x_L/x_H}{x_L/x_H} = 1\n$$\nThis result indicates, as expected, that hydrodynamic flow does not separate the isotopes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Chamber 2 (Molecular Effusion)**\nIn Chamber 2, the gas escapes through microscopic pores via molecular effusion. The rate of effusion of a gas is governed by Graham's Law, which states that the rate is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas and inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass.\nLet $R_L$ and $R_H$ be the initial effusion rates of the light and heavy isotopes, respectively. Let $P_L$ and $P_H$ be their initial partial pressures.\nAccording to Graham's Law:\n$$\nR_L \\propto \\frac{P_L}{\\sqrt{M_L}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad R_H \\propto \\frac{P_H}{\\sqrt{M_H}}\n$$\nThe partial pressure of each component is its mole fraction times the total pressure, $P_{total}$. So, $P_L = x_L P_{total}$ and $P_H = x_H P_{total}$.\nThe ratio of the effusion rates is:\n$$\n\\frac{R_L}{R_H} = \\frac{x_L P_{total} / \\sqrt{M_L}}{x_H P_{total} / \\sqrt{M_H}} = \\frac{x_L}{x_H} \\sqrt{\\frac{M_H}{M_L}}\n$$\nAs established earlier, the ratio of mole fractions in the effusing gas is equal to the ratio of the effusion rates: $y_L/y_H = R_L/R_H$.\nThe separation factor for Chamber 2, $\\alpha_2$, is:\n$$\n\\alpha_2 = \\frac{y_L/y_H}{x_L/x_H} = \\frac{(x_L/x_H) \\sqrt{M_H/M_L}}{x_L/x_H} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_H}{M_L}}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Ratio $\\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\alpha_2}$**\nNow we can compute the required ratio using the expressions for $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\alpha_2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M_H/M_L}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M_L}{M_H}}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Molar Masses and the Final Numerical Value**\nFirst, we compute the molar masses of the light ($^{235}\\text{UF}_6$) and heavy ($^{238}\\text{UF}_6$) species.\nThe molar mass of the light isotope, $M_L$, is:\n$$\nM_L = M(^{235}\\text{U}) + 6 \\times M(\\text{F}) = 235.04 \\text{ g/mol} + 6 \\times 19.00 \\text{ g/mol} = 235.04 + 114.00 = 349.04 \\text{ g/mol}\n$$\nThe molar mass of the heavy isotope, $M_H$, is:\n$$\nM_H = M(^{238}\\text{U}) + 6 \\times M(\\text{F}) = 238.05 \\text{ g/mol} + 6 \\times 19.00 \\text{ g/mol} = 238.05 + 114.00 = 352.05 \\text{ g/mol}\n$$\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\alpha_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{349.04}{352.05}}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\alpha_2} = \\sqrt{0.991449822...} = 0.99571573...\n$$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures as requested in the problem statement.\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\alpha_2} \\approx 0.9957\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9957}$$", "id": "1855996"}, {"introduction": "Previous exercises have focused on the initial rates of effusion, but the process is dynamic.
