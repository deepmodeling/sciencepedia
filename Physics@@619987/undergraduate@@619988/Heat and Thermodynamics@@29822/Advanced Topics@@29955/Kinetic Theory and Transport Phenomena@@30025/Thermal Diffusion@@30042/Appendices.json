The two long edges of the plate, located at $y=0$ and $y=L$, are thermally insulated, meaning there is no heat flow across them. Far from the heated edge, as $x$ approaches infinity, the temperature of the plate approaches zero.\n\nDetermine the steady-state temperature distribution $T(x, y)$ within the plate. Express your answer as a function of $x, y, L$, and $T_0$.", "solution": "The temperature distribution $T(x, y)$ in a two-dimensional, source-free medium in a steady state is governed by Laplace's equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 T = \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nWe will solve this partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form $T(x, y) = X(x)Y(y)$. Substituting this into Laplace's equation gives:\n$$ Y(y)\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} + X(x)\\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} = 0 $$\nDividing by $X(x)Y(y)$ allows us to separate the variables:\n$$ \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} = -\\frac{1}{Y(y)}\\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} $$\nSince the left side depends only on $x$ and the right side depends only on $y$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we will call the separation constant, $k$. This yields two ordinary differential equations:\n1. $\\frac{d^2 X}{dx^2} - kX = 0$\n2. $\\frac{d^2 Y}{dy^2} + kY = 0$\n\nNext, we apply the boundary conditions. The edges at $y=0$ and $y=L$ are thermally insulated, which means the heat flux normal to these edges is zero. Since heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient, this implies a Neumann boundary condition:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=L} = 0 $$\nIn terms of our separated functions, these become:\n$$ X(x)\\frac{dY}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=0} = 0 \\implies \\frac{dY}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=0} = 0 $$\n$$ X(x)\\frac{dY}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=L} = 0 \\implies \\frac{dY}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=L} = 0 $$\n\nWe solve the equation for $Y(y)$ first. The nature of the solution depends on the sign of $k$.\n- If $k=0$, $Y''=0$, so $Y(y) = Ay+B$. Applying the boundary conditions, $Y'(y)=A$, so $Y'(0)=A=0$ and $Y'(L)=A=0$. This gives $Y(y)=B$, a constant. This corresponds to an eigenfunction $Y_0(y)=1$ for eigenvalue $k_0=0$.\n- If $k<0$, let $k=-\\lambda^2$ with $\\lambda>0$. $Y''-\\lambda^2 Y=0$, so $Y(y) = A\\cosh(\\lambda y)+B\\sinh(\\lambda y)$. Then $Y'(y) = A\\lambda\\sinh(\\lambda y)+B\\lambda\\cosh(\\lambda y)$. $Y'(0)=B\\lambda=0 \\implies B=0$. Then $Y'(L)=A\\lambda\\sinh(\\lambda L)=0$. Since $\\lambda, L > 0$, $\\sinh(\\lambda L) \\neq 0$, so $A=0$. This gives only the trivial solution $Y(y)=0$.\n- If $k>0$, let $k=\\lambda^2$ with $\\lambda>0$. $Y''+\\lambda^2 Y=0$, so $Y(y) = A\\cos(\\lambda y)+B\\sin(\\lambda y)$. Then $Y'(y) = -A\\lambda\\sin(\\lambda y)+B\\lambda\\cos(\\lambda y)$. $Y'(0)=B\\lambda=0 \\implies B=0$. Then $Y'(L)=-A\\lambda\\sin(\\lambda L)=0$. For a non-trivial solution ($A\\neq 0$), we must have $\\sin(\\lambda L)=0$. This implies $\\lambda L = n\\pi$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nSo the eigenvalues are $k_n = \\lambda_n^2 = \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$ for $n=0, 1, 2, \\ldots$, and the corresponding eigenfunctions are $Y_n(y) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right)$.\n\nNow, we solve the equation for $X(x)$ for each eigenvalue $k_n$.\n- For $n \\ge 1$, $k_n = (\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2 > 0$. The equation is $X_n'' - (\\frac{n\\pi}{L})^2 X_n = 0$. The general solution is $X_n(x) = C_n \\exp\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) + D_n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. The boundary condition $T(x,y) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$ implies $X(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ diverges as $x \\to \\infty$, so its coefficient must be zero, $C_n=0$. This leaves $X_n(x) = D_n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n- For $n=0$, $k_0=0$. The equation is $X_0''=0$. The general solution is $X_0(x) = A_0 x + B_0$. The condition $X_0(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$ requires $A_0=0$ and $B_0=0$. Thus, the $n=0$ mode is zero.\n\nThe general solution for $T(x,y)$ is a superposition of the product solutions $X_n(x)Y_n(y)$:\n$$ T(x, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} D_n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right) $$\nThe coefficients $D_n$ are determined by the final boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ T(0, y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} D_n \\exp(0) \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right) = T_0 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{L}\\right) $$\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} D_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi y}{L}\\right) = D_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{L}\\right) + D_2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi y}{L}\\right) + \\ldots = T_0 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{L}\\right) $$\nBy comparing the terms on both sides of the equation (a consequence of the orthogonality of the cosine functions), we can determine the coefficients $D_n$. The function on the right-hand side is exactly the $n=1$ eigenfunction. Thus, we can match the coefficients directly:\n- For $n=1$: $D_1 = T_0$\n- For $n \\neq 1$: $D_n = 0$\n\nSubstituting these coefficients back into the general solution, only the $n=1$ term survives, yielding the final expression for the temperature distribution:\n$$ T(x, y) = T_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{L}\\right) $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi y}{L}\\right)}$$", "id": "1898146"}]}
