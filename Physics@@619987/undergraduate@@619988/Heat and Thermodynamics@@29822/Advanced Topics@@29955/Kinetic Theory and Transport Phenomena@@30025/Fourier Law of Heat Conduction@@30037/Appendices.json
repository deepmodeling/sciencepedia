However, many practical engineering systems, from building insulation to electronic components, involve layers of different materials. This first exercise explores such a composite system, challenging you to apply the core principle of steady-state heat flow—that the heat current must be constant through each layer—to determine the temperature at the material interface. Mastering this concept is fundamental for analyzing and designing any multi-layered thermal barrier.", "problem": "A composite thermal barrier is constructed by joining two solid cubes of different materials, Cube 1 and Cube 2, along one of their faces.

The material of Cube 1 has a thermal conductivity of $k_1$, and the material of Cube 2 has a thermal conductivity of $k_2$. In a steady-state condition, the free face of Cube 1 is maintained at a constant high temperature $T_1$, and the free face of Cube 2 is maintained at a constant low temperature $T_2$. The remaining four sides of the composite block are perfectly insulated, ensuring that heat flows only in one dimension, from the hot face to the cold face.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the temperature $T_{\\text{int}}$ at the planar interface between the two cubes.
