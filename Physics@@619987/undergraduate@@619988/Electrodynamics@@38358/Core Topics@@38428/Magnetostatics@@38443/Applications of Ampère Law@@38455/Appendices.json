By tackling a cylindrically symmetric wire where the current density $J$ varies with the radial distance $r$, you will practice the essential skill of calculating the enclosed current $I_{enc}$ through integration. This practice is fundamental for correctly applying Ampère's law to the more complex current distributions found in many real-world conductors [@problem_id:1566436].", "problem": "A long, straight cylindrical conductor of radius $R$ is designed to carry a total time-independent current $I_0$. The material of the conductor is non-uniform, causing the magnitude of the volume current density, $J$, to vary with the radial distance $r$ from the central axis according to the relationship $J(r) = \\alpha r$ for $r \\le R$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant. The current flows parallel to the axis of the cylinder. Determine the magnitude of the magnetic field, $B(r)$, at a radial distance $r$ inside the conductor (where $r < R$). Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $r$, $R$, $I_0$, and the permeability of free space, $\\mu_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the magnetic field inside a cylindrical conductor with a non-uniform current density. We can solve this using Ampère's Law, which relates the line integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop to the total current enclosed by that loop.\n\nAmpère's Law is given by:\n$$ \\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc} $$\n\nFirst, we establish the symmetry of the magnetic field. Given the cylindrical symmetry of the current distribution (it only depends on the radial distance $r$), the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ must also be cylindrically symmetric. The magnetic field lines will form concentric circles centered on the axis of the conductor, and the magnitude of the field, $B$, will only be a function of the radial distance $r$. At any point on such a circle, $\\vec{B}$ is tangential to the circle.\n\nWe choose an Amperian loop to be a circle of radius $r$ (where $r < R$), concentric with the conductor's axis. For this loop, the magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}$ is everywhere parallel to the line element vector $d\\vec{l}$. Therefore, the dot product simplifies: $\\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = B(r) dl$.\n\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of Ampère's Law becomes:\n$$ \\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\oint B(r) dl = B(r) \\oint dl $$\nThe integral $\\oint dl$ is just the circumference of the circular loop, which is $2\\pi r$. So, the LHS is:\n$$ \\text{LHS} = B(r) (2\\pi r) $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the right-hand side (RHS) of Ampère's Law. We need to find the current $I_{enc}$ enclosed by our Amperian loop of radius $r$. This is found by integrating the current density $J$ over the area of the loop.\n$$ I_{enc} = \\int_{A} J(s) dA $$\nHere, we use $s$ as the radial integration variable to distinguish it from the loop radius $r$. The area element $dA$ for a circular cross-section is the area of an infinitesimally thin ring of radius $s$ and thickness $ds$, so $dA = 2\\pi s \\, ds$. The current density is given as $J(s) = \\alpha s$.\n\nWe integrate from the center ($s=0$) to the radius of the Amperian loop ($s=r$):\n$$ I_{enc}(r) = \\int_0^r (\\alpha s) (2\\pi s \\, ds) = 2\\pi\\alpha \\int_0^r s^2 \\, ds $$\n$$ I_{enc}(r) = 2\\pi\\alpha \\left[ \\frac{s^3}{3} \\right]_0^r = \\frac{2\\pi\\alpha r^3}{3} $$\n\nThe problem specifies the total current $I_0$ in the wire, not the constant $\\alpha$. We must relate $\\alpha$ to $I_0$. The total current $I_0$ is the integral of the current density over the entire cross-section of the wire, i.e., out to the full radius $R$.\n$$ I_0 = \\int_0^R J(s) dA = \\int_0^R (\\alpha s) (2\\pi s \\, ds) = 2\\pi\\alpha \\int_0^R s^2 \\, ds $$\n$$ I_0 = 2\\pi\\alpha \\left[ \\frac{s^3}{3} \\right]_0^R = \\frac{2\\pi\\alpha R^3}{3} $$\n\nNow, we can solve for $\\alpha$ in terms of $I_0$ and $R$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{3I_0}{2\\pi R^3} $$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $\\alpha$ back into our equation for $I_{enc}(r)$:\n$$ I_{enc}(r) = \\frac{2\\pi r^3}{3} \\left( \\frac{3I_0}{2\\pi R^3} \\right) = I_0 \\frac{r^3}{R^3} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for the LHS and RHS back into Ampère's Law and solve for $B(r)$:\n$$ B(r) (2\\pi r) = \\mu_0 I_{enc} = \\mu_0 \\left( I_0 \\frac{r^3}{R^3} \\right) $$\n$$ B(r) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_0 r^3}{2\\pi r R^3} $$\n$$ B(r) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_0 r^2}{2\\pi R^3} $$\n\nThis is the expression for the magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance $r$ from the center, for $r<R$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\mu_0 I_0 r^2}{2 \\pi R^3}}$$", "id": "1566436"}, {"introduction": "Ampère's law is a versatile tool, applicable to symmetries beyond the cylindrical.
