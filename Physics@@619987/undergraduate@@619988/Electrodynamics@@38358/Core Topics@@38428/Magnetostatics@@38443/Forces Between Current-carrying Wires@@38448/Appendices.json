A second, separate wire is formed into a rigid closed loop. This loop consists of a semicircular arc of radius $R$ lying in the xy-plane with $y \\ge 0$, and a straight segment of length $2R$ that coincides with the x-axis, running from $x=-R$ to $x=R$.

Let's denote these as $\\vec{F}_{\\text{diameter}}$ and $\\vec{F}_{\\text{arc}}$, respectively. So, $\\vec{F} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{diameter}} + \\vec{F}_{\\text{arc}}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the force on the straight diameter of the loop. This segment lies on the x-axis, from $x=-R$ to $x=R$. The source of the magnetic field is the infinitely long wire also lying on the x-axis. The magnetic field produced by a long, straight current-carrying wire points azimuthally around the wire. By symmetry, the magnetic field on the axis of the wire itself must be zero. A more formal argument using the Biot-Savart law, $\\vec{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi} \\int \\frac{d\\vec{s} \\times \\hat{r}}{r^2}$, also shows that for any point on the line of the current, the vector from the source element $d\\vec{s}$ to the point is parallel to $d\\vec{s}$, so their cross product is zero. Thus, the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is zero everywhere along the straight segment of the loop. The magnetic force on a wire is given by $\\vec{F} = \\int I d\\vec{l} \\times \\vec{B}$. Since $\\vec{B} = \\vec{0}$ along the diameter, the force on this segment is zero: $\\vec{F}_{\\text{diameter}} = \\vec{0}$.\nTherefore, the net force on the loop is simply the force on the semicircular arc, $\\vec{F} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{arc}}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the force on the semicircular arc. The infinite wire along the x-axis with current $I_1$ produces a magnetic field in the surrounding space. At a point $(x,y,z)$, the field's magnitude is $B = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi r_{\\perp}}$, where $r_{\\perp} = \\sqrt{y^2+z^2}$ is the perpendicular distance from the wire. The direction is given by the right-hand rule. For a point $(x,y)$ in the xy-plane with $y>0$, the distance is $y$, and the magnetic field points in the positive z-direction. So, $\\vec{B}(x,y) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi y} \\hat{k}$.\n\nThe semicircular arc can be parameterized in polar coordinates. A point on the arc is given by the position vector $\\vec{r}(\\theta) = R\\cos\\theta \\hat{i} + R\\sin\\theta \\hat{j}$, where $\\theta$ is the angle with the positive x-axis. The current $I_2$ flows from $x=R$ to $x=-R$ along the arc, which corresponds to the angle $\\theta$ changing from $0$ to $\\pi$.\n\nAn infinitesimal segment of the arc is given by $d\\vec{l} = \\frac{d\\vec{r}}{d\\theta} d\\theta$.\n$d\\vec{l} = (-R\\sin\\theta \\hat{i} + R\\cos\\theta \\hat{j}) d\\theta$.\n\nThe position on the arc is $(x,y) = (R\\cos\\theta, R\\sin\\theta)$.

The x-component integral is $\\int_0^\\pi \\cot\\theta d\\theta$. The function $\\cot\\theta$ is antisymmetric about $\\theta=\\pi/2$ over the interval $[0, \\pi]$. For any infinitesimal force element in the x-direction at angle $\\theta$, there is a corresponding element at angle $\\pi-\\theta$ that produces an equal and opposite force in the x-direction. Thus, due to symmetry, the total x-component of the force is zero.\n$\\int_0^\\pi \\cot\\theta d\\theta = 0$.\n\nThe y-component integral is:\n$\\int_0^\\pi d\\theta = [\\theta]_0^\\pi = \\pi$.\n\nSubstituting the values of the integrals back into the force expression:\n$\\vec{F}_{\\text{arc}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2\\pi} [\\hat{i}(0) + \\hat{j}(\\pi)] = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2} \\hat{j}$.\n\nThe net force on the loop is $\\vec{F} = \\vec{F}_{\\text{diameter}} + \\vec{F}_{\\text{arc}} = \\vec{0} + \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2} \\hat{j}$.\nThe force is repulsive, directed away from the infinite wire in the positive y-direction. This is consistent with the fact that the current $I_2$ in the upper part of the arc is, on average, flowing opposite to the current $I_1$.\n\nIn Cartesian vector coordinates $(F_x, F_y, F_z)$, the force vector is $\\vec{F} = (0, \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2}, 0)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1 I_2}{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1581422"}, {"introduction": "Magnetic interactions are not limited to static scenarios; they can also govern the dynamics of a system.
