In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized, meaning it can only take on discrete values (integer or half-integer multiples of $\\hbar$, the reduced Planck constant). If the angular momentum of the charge-monopole system's field must obey this quantum rule, then the product of the fundamental charges, $eg$, must also be quantized.
