This beam strikes the air-oil interface. Let the angle of refraction into the oil layer be $\\theta_r$. According to Snell's law at the air-oil interface:\n$$n_{\\text{air}} \\sin(\\theta_i) = n_{\\text{oil}} \\sin(\\theta_r)$$\n\nThis refracted ray then travels through the oil layer and strikes the oil-water interface. Since the interfaces are parallel, the angle of incidence at the oil-water interface is also $\\theta_r$. The problem states that the light reflected from this second interface (oil-water) is perfectly linearly polarized.\n\nFor reflection between two dielectric media to be perfectly linearly polarized, the angle of incidence must be equal to Brewster's angle, $\\theta_B$. At the oil-water interface, this condition means the angle of incidence in the oil, $\\theta_r$, must be equal to the Brewster's angle for the oil-water system. Brewster's Law states:\n$$\\tan(\\theta_B) = \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$\nwhere $n_1$ is the index of refraction of the incident medium and $n_2$ is the index of refraction of the refracting medium. In our case, the incident medium is oil and the refracting medium is water. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\\tan(\\theta_r) = \\frac{n_{\\text{water}}}{n_{\\text{oil}}}$$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations and we need to find $\\theta_i$.
