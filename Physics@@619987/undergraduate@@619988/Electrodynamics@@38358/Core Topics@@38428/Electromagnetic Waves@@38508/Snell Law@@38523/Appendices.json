Let the final angle of refraction be $\\theta_4$.\n\nWe need to find the value of $\\theta_4$. We can apply Snell's law at each of the three parallel interfaces.\n\nAt the first interface (air-coating), Snell's law gives:\n$$n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2)$$\n\nAt the second interface (coating-polymer), the angle of incidence is the angle of refraction from the previous interface, $\\theta_2$, because the interfaces are parallel.
