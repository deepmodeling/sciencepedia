The experiment is conducted in a laboratory where the surrounding medium is air, which has a refractive index of $n_{air} = 1.00$. In the experiment, a laser beam is directed at normal incidence (perpendicularly) onto a flat surface of a sample of each material. The power reflectance, defined as the ratio of the reflected power to the incident power, is measured for each material. The measurement reveals that the reflectance from the air-A interface, $R_A$, is greater than the reflectance from the air-B interface, $R_B$. It is known from preliminary measurements that the refractive indices of both materials, $n_A$ and $n_B$, are greater than the refractive index of air.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the refractive indices $n_A$ and $n_B$?\n\nA. $n_A > n_B$\n\nB. $n_B > n_A$\n\nC. $n_A = n_B$\n\nD. $n_A n_B = 1$\n\nE.

The wavelength need not be specified to determine the ordering, since for a fixed measurement wavelength the reflectance depends only on the index value at that wavelength, and the monotonic dependence ensures that larger reflectance corresponds to larger refractive index.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is $n_{A}>n_{B}$.\n\nIncorrect options:\n- $n_{B}>n_{A}$ contradicts the monotonicity.\n- $n_{A}=n_{B}$ would give equal reflectances, not $R_{A}>R_{B}$.\n- $n_{A}n_{B}=1$ is unrelated to the observed reflectances.\n- The wavelength is not required for the ordering at the measurement wavelength.\n- Polarization does not matter at normal incidence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1800002"}, {"introduction": "Having established the basics at normal incidence, we now move to the more general case of light striking a surface at an angle.
