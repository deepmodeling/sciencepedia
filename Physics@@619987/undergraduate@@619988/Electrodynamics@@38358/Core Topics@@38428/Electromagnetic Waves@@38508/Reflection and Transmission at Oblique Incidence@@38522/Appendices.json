Consider a single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center, which acts as a point-like source of light, embedded deep within a large, flat slab of diamond. This NV center emits photons isotropically (uniformly in all directions). The diamond slab has a high refractive index of $n_d = 2.42$, and it is surrounded by air, which has a refractive index of $n_a = 1.00$. Due to the large difference in refractive indices, many of the photons emitted towards the diamond-air interface will undergo total internal reflection and remain trapped within the diamond.\n\nCalculate the fraction of the total photons isotropically emitted by the NV center that can escape from the top flat surface of the diamond slab into the air.
