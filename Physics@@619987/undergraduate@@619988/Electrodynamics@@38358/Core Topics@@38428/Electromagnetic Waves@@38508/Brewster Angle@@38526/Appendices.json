This thought experiment presents a counter-intuitive scenario where polarization effects occur at an interface between two media with seemingly identical refractive indices.

The phenomenon is a quantum optical effect. At the specific angle $\\theta_B$, polarization-dependent photon tunneling occurs across the index-matched boundary, leading to a polarized reflected beam.", "solution": "We begin with Maxwell’s boundary conditions at a planar interface between two lossless, non-magnetic media with refractive indices $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ (isotropic case). For a plane wave incident from medium 1 at angle $\\theta_{i}$ and transmitted into medium 2 at angle $\\theta_{t}$ satisfying Snell’s law $n_{1}\\sin\\theta_{i}=n_{2}\\sin\\theta_{t}$, the Fresnel amplitude reflection coefficients are\n$$\nr_{s}=\\frac{n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{i}-n_{2}\\cos\\theta_{t}}{n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{i}+n_{2}\\cos\\theta_{t}},\\qquad\nr_{p}=\\frac{n_{2}\\cos\\theta_{i}-n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{t}}{n_{2}\\cos\\theta_{i}+n_{1}\\cos\\theta_{t}}.\n$$\nIf $n_{1}=n_{2}$ and both media are isotropic and non-magnetic, then Snell’s law gives $\\theta_{t}=\\theta_{i}$, and hence $r_{s}=0$ and $r_{p}=0$ for all $\\theta_{i}$. Therefore, in a truly isotropic, lossless, index-matched interface there is no reflection at any angle. This directly shows that:\n- Using the isotropic Brewster formula $\\tan\\theta_{B}=n_{2}/n_{1}$ with $n_{1}=n_{2}$ to claim a nontrivial polarizing reflection at $\\theta_{B}=\\pi/4$ is incorrect, because in the isotropic, lossless, index-matched case both $r_{s}$ and $r_{p}$ vanish for all $\\theta_{i}$. Hence B is not a valid explanation.\n- If the media were isotropic and truly index-matched at all angles and polarizations, then any observation of reflected light would be impossible. However, the problem’s observation indicates perfectly linearly polarized reflected light at a specific angle, so the assumption that $n_{2}$ equals $n_{1}$ for all relevant propagation directions and polarizations must be violated in some way. Consequently, A is not necessarily true in general experimental contexts because $n_{2}$ measured at normal incidence does not guarantee isotropic equality for oblique incidence and all polarizations.\n\nConsider next whether material 2 could be a conductor. For a conductor, $n_{2}$ is complex, $n_{2}\\to \\tilde{n}_{2}=n+i\\kappa$, and the Fresnel coefficients become complex functions of $\\theta_{i}$. In a lossy medium (still non-magnetic), the condition $r_{p}=0$ cannot be satisfied at any real incidence angle because it would require simultaneously nulling both the real and imaginary parts of the numerator while maintaining the (complex) Snell relation, which does not occur. Instead, there is a pseudo-Brewster angle where $|r_{p}|$ attains a minimum but remains strictly non-zero. Therefore, the reflected beam cannot be perfectly linearly polarized (only partially polarized), and this also contradicts the stated transparency. Thus C cannot explain the observation.\n\nWe now examine anisotropy. Let material 2 be a lossless, non-magnetic anisotropic crystal with a permittivity tensor. For a given interface orientation and plane of incidence, the two orthogonal linear polarizations (s and p) experience different effective refractive indices, which we denote $n_{2,s}$ and $n_{2,p}$. These arise from the crystal’s index ellipsoid; for a uniaxial crystal with ordinary index $n_{o}$ and extraordinary index $n_{e}$, the effective extraordinary index depends on the propagation direction via\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n_{\\mathrm{ex}}(\\psi)^{2}}=\\frac{\\cos^{2}\\psi}{n_{e}^{2}}+\\frac{\\sin^{2}\\psi}{n_{o}^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $\\psi$ is the angle between the optic axis and the propagation direction inside the crystal. Consequently, at oblique incidence, $n_{2,s}$ and $n_{2,p}$ generally differ and depend on the crystal orientation. The generalized Fresnel problem at such an interface yields polarization-dependent reflection coefficients $r_{s}(n_{1},n_{2,s},\\theta_{i})$ and $r_{p}(n_{1},n_{2,p},\\theta_{i})$. In this anisotropic, lossless case, a Brewster condition for one polarization still exists: for example, the p-polarized reflection can vanish at a specific angle $\\theta_{B}$ determined by the appropriate effective index through the condition that the corresponding numerator vanishes, which can be written in the same algebraic form as\n$$\n\\tan\\theta_{B}=\\frac{n_{2,p,\\mathrm{eff}}}{n_{1}},\n$$\nwith $n_{2,p,\\mathrm{eff}}$ the effective refractive index relevant to the p-polarized transmitted wave for the given geometry. At that angle, $r_{p}=0$ while $r_{s}\\neq 0$ if $n_{2,s}\\neq n_{1}$. Therefore, the reflected light is perfectly linearly polarized (pure s), exactly as observed. \n\nCrucially, a “standard refractometer at normal incidence” reporting $n_{2}=n_{1}$ does not guarantee that $n_{2,s}$ and $n_{2,p}$ match $n_{1}$ at oblique incidence. At normal incidence, the instrument may probe a specific polarization or an effective index that accidentally equals $n_{1}$. However, at oblique incidence and with a particular crystal orientation, the two polarizations see different effective indices, allowing one of the Fresnel coefficients to vanish at a specific angle while the other remains non-zero. This provides a fully classical, physically consistent explanation of the observation without invoking absorption or quantum effects.\n\nHence:\n- A is too restrictive given anisotropy; the observation is not impossible.\n- B misapplies the isotropic Brewster formula to an index-matched isotropic interface where no reflection occurs.\n- C conflicts with transparency and cannot yield perfectly polarized reflection because $|r_{p}|$ cannot vanish in a lossy medium.\n- E is unnecessary; classical electrodynamics suffices.\n\nTherefore, the valid explanation is that material 2 is anisotropic and oriented so that one linear polarization is index-matched (or satisfies a Brewster condition) while the orthogonal polarization is not, yielding a perfectly linearly polarized reflected beam at a specific angle.
