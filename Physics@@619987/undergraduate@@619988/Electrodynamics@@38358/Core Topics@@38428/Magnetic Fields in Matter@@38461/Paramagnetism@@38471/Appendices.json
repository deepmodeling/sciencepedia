Two small, uncharged spheres of identical size and mass are used. Sphere P is made of a paramagnetic material, and Sphere D is made of a diamagnetic material. Both spheres are initially at rest. They are placed, one at a time, at the same fixed point in space near a single pole of a very strong stationary magnet. The magnetic field produced by the magnet is highly non-uniform; its magnitude is strongest at the magnet's pole and decreases with distance from the pole.\n\nAssuming no other forces (such as gravity or air resistance) are significant, which of the following statements best describes the initial direction of motion for each sphere when released from rest?\n\nA. Both Sphere P and Sphere D will be attracted towards the magnet's pole.\n\nB. Both Sphere P and Sphere D will be repelled away from the magnet's pole.\n\nC.

This behavior is a delicate balance between the aligning influence of an external magnetic field and the randomizing effects of thermal energy. This practice delves into this microscopic competition, asking you to calculate the degree of magnetic alignment in a practical scenario and, in doing so, reveal why a paramagnetic needle is ineffective as a compass at room temperature [@problem_id:1811497].", "problem": "A materials engineering student is investigating the possibility of constructing a compass needle from a novel, non-ferromagnetic material. The material is strongly paramagnetic and can be modeled as a collection of independent atoms, each possessing a permanent magnetic dipole moment. The student's goal is to quantify how effectively the Earth's magnetic field can align these atomic dipoles at room temperature.\n\nTo do this, you are to calculate the degree of magnetic alignment. This can be expressed as the ratio of the actual induced magnetic moment of the needle to its theoretical maximum saturation magnetic moment, where the saturation moment is the value if all atomic dipoles were perfectly aligned with the external field.\n\nAssume the needle is at a temperature $T = 293 \\text{ K}$ and is subjected to the Earth's magnetic field of strength $B = 5.50 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ T}$.

This ratio quantifies the degree of alignment of the atomic magnetic dipoles.\n\nFirst, let's define the saturation magnetic moment, $m_{\\text{sat}}$. This occurs when all the individual atomic magnetic dipoles are perfectly aligned with the external magnetic field. Let $N$ be the total number of paramagnetic atoms in the needle. If each atom has a magnetic moment of magnitude $\\mu$, the saturation moment is the sum of all these individual moments:\n$$m_{\\text{sat}} = N \\mu$$\n\nNext, we need to find the actual net magnetic moment, $m_{\\text{net}}$, under the given conditions. For a paramagnetic material, the alignment of atomic dipoles is a competition between the ordering effect of the external magnetic field $B$ and the disordering effect of thermal energy, characterized by $k_B T$.\n\nIn statistical mechanics, the average alignment of a magnetic dipole in the direction of the field, $\\langle\\mu_z\\rangle$, for a collection of non-interacting dipoles is given by the Langevin function. However, the problem states that we are in the high-temperature / low-field limit, where $\\mu B \\ll k_B T$.
