This is a boundary value problem in magnetostatics. The solution involves applying the boundary conditions for magnetic fields at the interface between two linear magnetic materials.\n\nThe relationship between the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ and the magnetic field intensity $\\vec{H}$ in a linear, isotropic, and homogeneous material with magnetic permeability $\\mu$ is given by $\\vec{B} = \\mu \\vec{H}$.\n\nThe boundary conditions at the interface ($z=0$) between two magnetic materials in the absence of free surface currents ($\\vec{K}_f = 0$) are:\n1. The normal component of the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is continuous across the interface: $B_{1,\\perp} = B_{2,\\perp}$.\n2. The tangential component of the magnetic field intensity $\\vec{H}$ is continuous across the interface: $\\vec{H}_{1,\\parallel} = \\vec{H}_{2,\\parallel}$.\n\nThe interface is the plane $z=0$. The unit vector normal to this interface is $\\hat{n} = \\hat{z}$.\nTherefore, the component of any vector field parallel to the $z$-axis is the normal component, and the components in the $xy$-plane are the tangential components.\n\nLet's denote the magnetic field in Region 2 as $\\vec{B}_2 = B_{2,x}\\hat{x} + B_{2,y}\\hat{y} + B_{2,z}\\hat{z}$ and the magnetic field intensity as $\\vec{H}_2 = H_{2,x}\\hat{x} + H_{2,y}\\hat{y} + H_{2,z}\\hat{z}$.\n\nFirst, we apply the boundary condition for the normal component of $\\vec{B}$. The normal component in Region 1 is the $z$-component of $\\vec{B}_1$.\nFrom the given expression $\\vec{B}_1 = C_x \\hat{x} + C_z \\hat{z}$, we have $B_{1,z} = C_z$.\nSo, $B_{1,\\perp} = B_{1,z} = C_z$.\nAccording to the boundary condition, $B_{2,\\perp} = B_{1,\\perp}$.
