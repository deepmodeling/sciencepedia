In a linear magnetic material, the magnetization is related to the auxiliary magnetic field $\\vec{H}$ by:\n$$\n\\vec{M} = \\chi_m \\vec{H}\n$$\nSo, our first step is to find the field $\\vec{H}$ inside the solenoid. We can use Ampere's law for the $\\vec{H}$ field, which states that the line integral of $\\vec{H}$ around a closed loop is equal to the free current enclosed by the loop:\n$$\n\\oint \\vec{H} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = I_{f, \\text{enc}}\n$$\nDue to the symmetry of a very long solenoid, the magnetic fields must be directed along the z-axis and can only depend on the radial distance $\\rho$. Thus, $\\vec{H} = H(\\rho) \\hat{z}$. Outside an ideal long solenoid, the magnetic field is zero.\n\nLet's consider a rectangular Amperian loop of length $L$.
