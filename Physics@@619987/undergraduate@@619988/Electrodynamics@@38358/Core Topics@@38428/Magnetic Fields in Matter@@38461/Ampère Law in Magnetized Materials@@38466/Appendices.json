The interface is the cylindrical wall of the cavity. At any point on this wall, the normal vector $\\hat{n}$ is in the radial direction (perpendicular to the z-axis), while the parallel directions are along the axis ($\\hat{z}$) and around it (azimuthal).\n\nThe problem states the cavity is \"very long and narrow\".
