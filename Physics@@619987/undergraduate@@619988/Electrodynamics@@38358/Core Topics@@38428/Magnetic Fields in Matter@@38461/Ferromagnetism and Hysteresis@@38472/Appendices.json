This practice explores this fundamental principle by examining how the energy stored in a solenoid changes when its core material is replaced.

The inductor is constructed as a long solenoid with $n$ turns per unit length, a cross-sectional area $A$, and length $L$. A constant current $I$ flows through its windings. The core of the solenoid is initially filled with a standard ferrite material (Material 1), which behaves as a linear magnetic material with a relative magnetic permeability of $\\mu_{r1}$. To increase the energy storage capacity, the engineer considers replacing this core with a new advanced magnetic alloy (Material 2), which has a relative magnetic permeability of $\\mu_{r2}$. Assume the solenoid is long enough that the magnetic field inside is uniform and end effects can be neglected. The physical dimensions of the solenoid and the current $I$ do not change when the core is replaced. Let $\\mu_0$ be the permeability of free space.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the total magnetic energy stored in the inductor with Material 2 in its core to the total magnetic energy stored with Material 1.

For a long solenoid with $n$ turns per unit length carrying a current $I$, the magnetic field intensity is uniform inside and given by:\n$$H = nI$$\nThis value depends only on the source currents (via the winding density and current $I$) and is independent of the material inside the solenoid's core.\n\nThe magnetic flux density $B$ inside the material is related to the magnetic field intensity $H$ by the material's magnetic permeability $\\mu$:\n$$B = \\mu H$$\nThe magnetic permeability $\\mu$ can be expressed in terms of the material's relative permeability $\\mu_r$ and the permeability of free space $\\mu_0$ as:\n$$\\mu = \\mu_r \\mu_0$$\nSo, for the two materials, the magnetic flux densities are:\nFor Material 1: $B_1 = \\mu_1 H = \\mu_{r1} \\mu_0 n I$\nFor Material 2: $B_2 = \\mu_2 H = \\mu_{r2} \\mu_0 n I$\n\nThe energy stored per unit volume in a magnetic material, known as the magnetic energy density $u_B$, is given by:\n$$u_B = \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{B} \\cdot \\vec{H}$$\nFor a linear, isotropic material where $\\vec{B}$ and $\\vec{H}$ are parallel, this simplifies to $u_B = \\frac{1}{2} B H$. Substituting $B = \\mu H$, we get an alternative expression for the energy density:\n$$u_B = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu H^2$$\nThis form is particularly convenient for this problem because $H$ remains constant when the core material is changed.\n\nThe total magnetic energy $U$ stored in the solenoid is the energy density $u_B$ multiplied by the volume of the core, $V = AL$, since the field is assumed to be uniform throughout this volume.\n$$U = u_B V = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\mu H^2\\right) (AL)$$\nNow we can write the total energy stored for each case.\nFor Material 1, the total energy $U_1$ is:\n$$U_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_1 H^2 V = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mu_{r1} \\mu_0) (nI)^2 (AL)$$\nFor Material 2, the total energy $U_2$ is:\n$$U_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_2 H^2 V = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mu_{r2} \\mu_0) (nI)^2 (AL)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{U_2}{U_1}$. We can compute this by dividing the expression for $U_2$ by the expression for $U_1$:\n$$\\frac{U_2}{U_1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{r2} \\mu_0 (nI)^2 (AL)}{\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{r1} \\mu_0 (nI)^2 (AL)}$$\nAll the common terms, including the factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$, the permeability of free space $\\mu_0$, the squared term $(nI)^2$, and the volume $(AL)$, cancel out from the numerator and denominator. This leaves a simple ratio of the relative permeabilities:\n$$\\frac{U_2}{U_1} = \\frac{\\mu_{r2}}{\\mu_{r1}}$$\nThis result shows that the energy stored in the inductor is directly proportional to the relative permeability of its core material, given that the driving current and the geometry are held constant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\mu_{r2}}{\\mu_{r1}}}$$", "id": "1580866"}, {"introduction": "While high permeability is a desirable trait, ferromagnetic materials also exhibit a non-linear and history-dependent behavior known as hysteresis.
