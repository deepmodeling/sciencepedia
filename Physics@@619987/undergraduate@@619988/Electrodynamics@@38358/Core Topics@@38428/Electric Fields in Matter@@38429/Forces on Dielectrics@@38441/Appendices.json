This problem offers a classic and practical scenario: calculating the force required to move a dielectric slab inside a capacitor. By analyzing a system kept at a constant charge, this exercise demonstrates how to compute forces from the change in the system's stored potential energy, a powerful and versatile method based on the principle of virtual work. Mastering this calculation provides deep insight into why dielectrics are pulled into capacitors and how the force varies with the slab's position [@problem_id:1799134].", "problem": "A square parallel-plate capacitor with side length $L$ and plate separation $d$ is electrically isolated, holding a constant total charge of $+Q$ on one plate and $-Q$ on the other. A rigid dielectric slab, with a dielectric constant $\\kappa > 1$ and dimensions identical to the space between the plates ($L \\times L \\times d$), is partially inserted into the capacitor. Let $x$ denote the length of the slab that is inside the capacitor, measured parallel to one of the plate edges, such that $0 \\le x \\le L$. The remaining volume between the plates is a vacuum, with permittivity $\\epsilon_0$. An external agent applies a force to control the slab's position. Let $F(x)$ be the magnitude of this external force required to hold the slab in static equilibrium against the capacitor's attractive pull. Calculate the ratio $\\frac{F(x \\to 0)}{F(x \\to L)}$, which is the ratio of the force required just as the slab begins to enter to the force required when it is almost fully inserted. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $\\kappa$.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we first need to find the electrostatic force acting on the dielectric slab as a function of its insertion depth, $x$. The magnitude of the external force required to hold the slab in equilibrium, $F(x)$, will be equal to the magnitude of this electrostatic force. The electrostatic force can be derived from the potential energy of the system, $U$, using the relation $F_e = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$. The force $F_e$ points in the direction that lowers the system's potential energy. We are interested in its magnitude, so $F(x) = \\left| -\\frac{dU}{dx} \\right|$.\n\nThe capacitor is electrically isolated, so the total charge $Q$ on the plates is constant. The potential energy stored in a capacitor with constant charge is given by $U = \\frac{Q^2}{2C}$, where $C$ is the total capacitance of the system. Our first task is to determine the total capacitance $C$ as a function of $x$.\n\nThe system can be modeled as two capacitors connected in parallel. One capacitor, $C_1$, corresponds to the section filled with the dielectric, and the other, $C_2$, corresponds to the vacuum section.\n\nFor the section with the dielectric, the area of the plates is $A_1 = L \\times x$. The capacitance is:\n$$C_1 = \\frac{\\kappa \\epsilon_0 A_1}{d} = \\frac{\\kappa \\epsilon_0 L x}{d}$$\n\nFor the vacuum section, the area of the plates is $A_2 = L \\times (L-x)$. The capacitance is:\n$$C_2 = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 A_2}{d} = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L (L-x)}{d}$$\n\nSince these two conceptual capacitors are in parallel (they share the same potential difference), the total capacitance $C(x)$ is the sum of their individual capacitances:\n$$C(x) = C_1 + C_2 = \\frac{\\kappa \\epsilon_0 L x}{d} + \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L (L-x)}{d}$$\nFactoring out common terms, we get:\n$$C(x) = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L}{d} (\\kappa x + L - x) = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L}{d} [L + (\\kappa-1)x]$$\n\nNow we can write the potential energy $U(x)$ of the system:\n$$U(x) = \\frac{Q^2}{2C(x)} = \\frac{Q^2}{2 \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L}{d} [L + (\\kappa-1)x] \\right)} = \\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L} [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the magnitude of the electrostatic force by taking the negative derivative of the potential energy with respect to $x$.\n$$F_e(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L} [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^{-1} \\right)$$\nThe prefactor $\\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L}$ is constant with respect to $x$. Using the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$F_e(x) = -\\left( \\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L} \\right) \\left( -1 \\cdot [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[L + (\\kappa-1)x] \\right)$$\nThe derivative of the inner term is $\\frac{d}{dx}[L + (\\kappa-1)x] = \\kappa-1$.\n$$F_e(x) = -\\left( \\frac{Q^2 d}{2 \\epsilon_0 L} \\right) \\left( -[L + (\\kappa-1)x]^{-2} (\\kappa-1) \\right)$$\n$$F_e(x) = \\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^2}$$\nThe magnitude of the external force is $F(x) = |F_e(x)|$. Since $\\kappa > 1$, the expression is positive, so $F(x) = F_e(x)$. A positive force indicates it acts in the direction of increasing $x$, pulling the slab into the capacitor.\n\nNow we evaluate this force at the two specified limits.\nFirst, the force as the slab just begins to enter, $x \\to 0$:\n$$F(x \\to 0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^2} = \\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L [L]^2} = \\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L^3}$$\n\nSecond, the force as the slab is almost fully inserted, $x \\to L$:\n$$F(x \\to L) = \\lim_{x \\to L} \\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L [L + (\\kappa-1)x]^2} = \\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L [L + (\\kappa-1)L]^2}$$\nSimplifying the denominator term:\n$$[L + (\\kappa-1)L]^2 = [L(1 + \\kappa - 1)]^2 = (L\\kappa)^2 = L^2 \\kappa^2$$\nSo, the force becomes:\n$$F(x \\to L) = \\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L (L^2 \\kappa^2)} = \\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L^3 \\kappa^2}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio:\n$$\\frac{F(x \\to 0)}{F(x \\to L)} = \\frac{\\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L^3}}{\\frac{Q^2 d (\\kappa-1)}{2 \\epsilon_0 L^3 \\kappa^2}}$$\nAll the terms cancel out except for the $\\kappa^2$ in the denominator of the denominator:\n$$\\frac{F(x \\to 0)}{F(x \\to L)} = \\frac{1}{1/\\kappa^2} = \\kappa^2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\kappa^{2}}$$", "id": "1799134"}, {"introduction": "While the energy method is effective for macroscopic systems, the force on a dielectric ultimately originates from the interaction of a non-uniform electric field with the polarized material at a microscopic level.
