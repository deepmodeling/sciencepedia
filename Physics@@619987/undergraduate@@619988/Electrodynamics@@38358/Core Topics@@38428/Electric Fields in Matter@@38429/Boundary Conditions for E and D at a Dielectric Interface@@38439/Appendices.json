The source is a point charge located at the origin, and the boundary between the two dielectric media is a cone with its vertex at the origin. This high degree of spherical symmetry with respect to the origin suggests that the electric field lines must be purely radial. We can therefore make the ansatz that the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is everywhere of the form $\\mathbf{E} = E_r(r, \\theta, \\phi) \\hat{r}$.\n\nIn electrostatics, the electric field must be curl-free, i.e., $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$. In spherical coordinates, the curl of a field $\\mathbf{F} = F_r \\hat{r}$ is given by:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\frac{1}{r\\sin\\theta} \\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\sin\\theta F_\\phi)}{\\partial\\theta} - \\frac{\\partial F_\\theta}{\\partial\\phi} \\right) \\hat{r} + \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta} \\frac{\\partial F_r}{\\partial\\phi} - \\frac{\\partial (r F_\\phi)}{\\partial r} \\right) \\hat{\\theta} + \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{\\partial (r F_\\theta)}{\\partial r} - \\frac{\\partial F_r}{\\partial\\theta} \\right) \\hat{\\phi} $$\nFor our purely radial field, $E_\\theta = 0$ and $E_\\phi = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{r\\sin\\theta} \\frac{\\partial E_r}{\\partial\\phi} \\hat{\\theta} - \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial E_r}{\\partial\\theta} \\hat{\\phi} $$\nDue to the axial symmetry of the physical setup, the field cannot depend on the azimuthal angle $\\phi$, so $\\frac{\\partial E_r}{\\partial\\phi} = 0$. The condition $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$ then requires that $\\frac{\\partial E_r}{\\partial\\theta} = 0$. This implies $E_r$ can only be a function of $r$, so $\\mathbf{E} = E_r(r) \\hat{r}$.\n\nIn any source-free region ($r > 0$), the divergence of the electric field satisfies $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$ (in a uniform medium). For our field $\\mathbf{E} = E_r(r) \\hat{r}$, the divergence is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 E_r(r))$. Setting this to zero gives $\\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 E_r(r)) = 0$, which integrates to $r^2 E_r(r) = C$, where $C$ is a constant of integration. Thus, the electric field throughout all space must have the form:\n$$ \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{C}{r^2} \\hat{r} $$\nThe electrostatic potential $V$ is found by integrating $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V$. For this radial field, we get $V(r) = \\frac{C}{r}$, assuming $V \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$.\n\nThis form for $\\mathbf{E}$ and $V$ must satisfy the boundary conditions at the cone's surface ($\\theta = \\alpha$).\n1.  The tangential component of $\\mathbf{E}$ must be continuous. The directions tangent to the cone surface are $\\hat{r}$ and $\\hat{\\phi}$. $E_r = C/r^2$ is the same on both sides of the boundary, and $E_\\phi = 0$ on both sides. This condition is satisfied.\n2.  The normal component of the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ must be continuous, as there are no free surface charges on the interface. The direction normal to the cone surface is $\\hat{\\theta}$. Since $\\mathbf{E}$ is purely radial, $E_\\theta = 0$ everywhere. $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$, so $D_\\theta = \\epsilon E_\\theta = 0$ on both sides of the boundary.
