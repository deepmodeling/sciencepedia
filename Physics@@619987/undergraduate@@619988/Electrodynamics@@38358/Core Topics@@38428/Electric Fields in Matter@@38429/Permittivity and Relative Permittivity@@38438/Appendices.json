We can model this complex arrangement by breaking it down into simpler capacitors connected in series and parallel.\n\nThe first division of the capacitor is by a plane perpendicular to the plates, which splits the capacitor into two halves. These two halves are in a parallel configuration. Therefore, the total equivalent capacitance $C_{eq}$ is the sum of the capacitances of the two halves:\n$$C_{eq} = C_1 + C_2$$\nwhere $C_1$ is the capacitance of the first half and $C_2$ is the equivalent capacitance of the second half.\n\nLet's calculate $C_1$ first.
