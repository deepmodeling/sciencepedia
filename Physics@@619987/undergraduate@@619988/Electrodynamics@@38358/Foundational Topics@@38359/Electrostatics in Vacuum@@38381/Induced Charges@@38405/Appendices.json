Because the electrostatic field inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium is zero, Gauss's law implies that the net charge enclosed by such a Gaussian surface is zero. Therefore, the charge $+q$ inside the cavity induces a charge $-q$ on the inner surface and a charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the shell so that the conductor remains neutral and the field in the conductor vanishes.\n\nConsider now the region outside the shell, $r>R_{2}$.

The method of images provides an elegant workaround for specific geometries by replacing the conductor with a set of fictitious 'image' charges.

The electric potential $V(\\vec{r})$ produced by this induced charge distribution can be described far from the origin by a multipole expansion. The leading-order term in this expansion is the monopole term, which is proportional to the total induced charge. Determine the electric monopole moment of this induced surface charge distribution.

By Gauss's Law, the total induced charge on these inner faces must sum to $-q$, so $Q_1 + Q_2 = -q$. The specific values of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ depend only on the geometry of the charge and the plates ($d$ and $L$), not on the absolute potential of the isolated plates.
