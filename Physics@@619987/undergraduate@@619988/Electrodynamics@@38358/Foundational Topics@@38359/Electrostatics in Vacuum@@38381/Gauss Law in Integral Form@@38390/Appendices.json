Determine the electric flux through the surface area of just one of these two triangular regions.\n\nExpress your answer as an analytic expression in terms of the charge $q$ and the vacuum permittivity, $\\epsilon_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the electric flux through a specific triangular portion of one face of a cube that encloses a point charge $q$ at its center. We can solve this problem by applying Gauss's Law and leveraging the symmetry of the configuration.\n\nGauss's Law states that the total electric flux, $\\Phi_{total}$, through any closed surface (a Gaussian surface) is equal to the total charge enclosed by that surface, $Q_{enc}$, divided by the vacuum permittivity, $\\epsilon_0$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\Phi_{total} = \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nLet's choose the entire cube as our Gaussian surface. This surface is closed and encloses the point charge $q$. Therefore, the total charge enclosed is $Q_{enc} = q$. The total electric flux passing through all six faces of the cube is:\n$$ \\Phi_{total} = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nNext, we use a symmetry argument. The point charge is located at the geometric center of the cube. Due to this central placement, the charge is equidistant from each of the six faces, and the electric field it produces has the same distribution pattern over each face. Consequently, the total electric flux must be shared equally among the six identical faces of the cube.\n\nLet $\\Phi_{face}$ be the flux through any single square face. Then:\n$$ \\Phi_{face} = \\frac{\\Phi_{total}}{6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0} \\right) = \\frac{q}{6\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nNow, we need to find the flux through only a part of this face: one of the two identical right-angled triangles formed by a diagonal. Let's call the two triangular regions $T_1$ and $T_2$. The flux through the entire face is the sum of the fluxes through these two regions:\n$$ \\Phi_{face} = \\Phi_{T_1} + \\Phi_{T_2} $$\n\nWe can apply another symmetry argument. The charge is at the center of the cube. A plane containing the center of the cube and the diagonal of the face in question will bisect the cube's interior and the face's surface symmetrically. The electric field distribution is symmetric with respect to this plane. Therefore, the flux passing through triangle $T_1$ must be equal to the flux passing through triangle $T_2$.\n$$ \\Phi_{T_1} = \\Phi_{T_2} $$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for the flux through the face, we get:\n$$ \\Phi_{face} = \\Phi_{T_1} + \\Phi_{T_1} = 2\\Phi_{T_1} $$\n\nThe flux through one triangular region, which we can call $\\Phi_{triangle}$, is therefore half the flux through the entire face:\n$$ \\Phi_{triangle} = \\Phi_{T_1} = \\frac{\\Phi_{face}}{2} $$\n\nFinally, substituting the expression we found for $\\Phi_{face}$:\n$$ \\Phi_{triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{q}{6\\epsilon_0} \\right) = \\frac{q}{12\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nThe side length $L$ of the cube does not affect the total enclosed flux or its distribution among the faces, so it does not appear in the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{q}{12 \\epsilon_{0}}}$$", "id": "1583782"}, {"introduction": "While point charges are a useful starting point, real-world objects often have charge distributed throughout their volume. This practice problem [@problem_id:1583767] guides you through a canonical application of Gauss's law: finding the electric field inside a cylinder with a non-uniform charge density. Mastering this type of calculation is a crucial step toward analyzing more realistic electrostatic systems.", "problem": "Consider a very long, solid, non-conducting cylinder of radius $R$. The cylinder has a volume charge density $\\rho$ that varies with the radial distance $s$ from its central axis. The charge density is given by the function $\\rho(s) = \\rho_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{s}{R}\\right)$ for $0 \\le s \\le R$, and is zero for $s > R$. In this expression, $\\rho_0$ is a positive constant with units of charge per unit volume.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the electric field, $E(s)$, at a radial distance $s$ from the axis, for a point located inside the cylinder ($s < R$). Your answer should be a symbolic expression in terms of $s$, $R$, $\\rho_0$, and the permittivity of free space, $\\epsilon_0$.", "solution": "To find the electric field inside the cylinder, we use Gauss's Law in its integral form: $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0}$.\n\nThe charge distribution possesses cylindrical symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the electric field $\\vec{E}$ must point radially outward from the central axis, and its magnitude can only depend on the radial distance $s$. We can write the electric field vector as $\\vec{E}(s) = E(s) \\hat{s}$, where $\\hat{s}$ is the radial unit vector in a cylindrical coordinate system.\n\nWe choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface of radius $s$ (where $s < R$) and arbitrary length $L$, coaxial with the charge distribution. The surface integral $\\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A}$ can be split into three parts: the two flat end caps and the curved side wall.\n\nFor the two end caps, the area vector $d\\vec{A}$ is parallel to the cylinder's axis (in the $\\hat{z}$ and $-\\hat{z}$ directions), while the electric field $\\vec{E}$ is radial ($\\hat{s}$ direction). Thus, $\\vec{E}$ is perpendicular to $d\\vec{A}$ on the end caps, meaning $\\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = 0$. So, the flux through the end caps is zero.\n\nFor the curved side wall, the area vector $d\\vec{A}$ is also in the radial direction, parallel to $\\vec{E}$. The magnitude of the electric field $E(s)$ is constant everywhere on this surface. Therefore, the flux integral over the curved side becomes:\n$$ \\oint_{\\text{side}} \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\int_{\\text{side}} E(s) dA = E(s) \\int_{\\text{side}} dA $$\nThe area of the curved side is its circumference times its length, which is $2\\pi s L$. So, the left-hand side of Gauss's Law is:\n$$ \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = E(s) (2\\pi s L) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total charge $Q_{enc}$ enclosed by our Gaussian surface.
