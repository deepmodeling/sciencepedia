The capacitance of this configuration is denoted as $C_0$.\n\nSubsequently, one of the plates is rotated by an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ about an axis perpendicular to the plates and passing through their geometric centers. The separation distance $d$ is maintained. Let the capacitance of this new configuration be $C_{45}$.\n\nAssuming that the effects of fringing electric fields are negligible, the capacitance is directly proportional to the overlapping area of the two plates. Determine the exact value of the ratio $\\frac{C_{45}}{C_0}$. Your answer should be a closed-form analytic expression.", "solution": "The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor, neglecting fringing fields, is given by the formula $C = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 A_{overlap}}{d}$, where $A_{overlap}$ is the area over which the two plates overlap, $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $d$ is the separation distance between the plates.\n\nFirst, we determine the initial capacitance, $C_0$. In this configuration, the square plates are perfectly aligned. Therefore, the overlapping area is the full area of one plate, which is $A_0 = L^2$. The initial capacitance is:\n$$C_0 = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 L^2}{d}$$\n\nNext, we determine the capacitance $C_{45}$ after one plate is rotated by $45^{\\circ}$. The capacitance is now given by $C_{45} = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 A_{45}}{d}$, where $A_{45}$ is the new overlapping area. The problem then reduces to calculating this overlapping area.\n\nThe ratio we need to find is:\n$$\\frac{C_{45}}{C_0} = \\frac{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 A_{45}}{d}}{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 L^2}{d}} = \\frac{A_{45}}{L^2}$$\n\nTo find $A_{45}$, we can use a coordinate system. Let the center of both squares be at the origin $(0,0)$. The unrotated square occupies the region defined by the inequalities $|x| \\le \\frac{L}{2}$ and $|y| \\le \\frac{L}{2}$.\n\nThe second square is rotated by $45^{\\circ}$. The vertices of the unrotated square are at $(\\pm \\frac{L}{2}, \\pm \\frac{L}{2})$. Rotating these vertices by $45^{\\circ}$ gives the vertices of the second square. For example, the vertex $(\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2})$ is rotated to $(0, \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}})$. The four vertices of the rotated square are $(0, \\pm \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}})$ and $(\\pm \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}}, 0)$. The lines forming the sides of this rotated square are given by the equations $x+y = \\pm \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $x-y = \\pm \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe overlapping area is the region defined by the intersection of the two squares. This shape is a regular octagon. A straightforward way to calculate its area is to take the area of the unrotated square, $L^2$, and subtract the four small triangles that are cut off at its corners by the sides of the rotated square.\n\nDue to symmetry, all four corner triangles are identical. Let's focus on the triangle cut off from the top-right corner of the unrotated square, which is at $(\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2})$. This corner is cut off by the line segment of the rotated square whose equation is $x+y = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe vertices of this small, right-angled triangle are:\n1.  The corner of the unrotated square itself: $V_1 = (\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2})$.\n2.  The intersection of the line $x+y = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}}$ with the edge $x = \\frac{L}{2}$ of the unrotated square. Substituting $x = \\frac{L}{2}$ gives $\\frac{L}{2} + y = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}}$, so $y = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{L}{2}$. This vertex is $V_2 = (\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{L}{2})$.\n3.  The intersection of the line $x+y = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}}$ with the edge $y = \\frac{L}{2}$. Substituting $y = \\frac{L}{2}$ gives $x + \\frac{L}{2} = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}}$, so $x = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{L}{2}$. This vertex is $V_3 = (\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2})$.\n\nThe triangle is a right-angled isosceles triangle with the right angle at $V_1$. The length of the two equal legs, $s$, can be calculated. The length of the vertical leg (between $V_1$ and $V_2$) is the difference in their y-coordinates:\n$$s = \\frac{L}{2} - \\left(\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}} - \\frac{L}{2}\\right) = L - \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{2}} = L\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$$\nThe area of one such triangle, $A_{tri}$, is:\n$$A_{tri} = \\frac{1}{2} s^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[L\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\right]^2 = \\frac{L^2}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{L^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\right)$$\nThere are four such triangles, so the total area removed from the unrotated square is:\n$$A_{removed} = 4 \\times A_{tri} = 4 \\times \\frac{L^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\right) = 2L^2 \\left(\\frac{3}{2} - \\sqrt{2}\\right) = L^2(3 - 2\\sqrt{2})$$\nThe overlapping area, $A_{45}$, is the initial area of the square, $L^2$, minus the removed area:\n$$A_{45} = L^2 - A_{removed} = L^2 - L^2(3 - 2\\sqrt{2}) = L^2(1 - 3 + 2\\sqrt{2}) = L^2(2\\sqrt{2} - 2)$$\nFinally, we can compute the desired ratio:\n$$\\frac{C_{45}}{C_0} = \\frac{A_{45}}{L^2} = \\frac{L^2(2\\sqrt{2} - 2)}{L^2} = 2\\sqrt{2} - 2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}-2}$$", "id": "1569956"}, {"introduction": "Ideal textbook configurations provide a crucial foundation, but real-world components often have imperfections.
