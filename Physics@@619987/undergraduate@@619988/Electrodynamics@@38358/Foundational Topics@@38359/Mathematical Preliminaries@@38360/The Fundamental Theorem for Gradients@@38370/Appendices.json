In this case, the line integral is path-independent, and by the fundamental theorem for gradients, the potential difference simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta V = -\\int_{P_i}^{P_f} (-\\nabla V) \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\int_{P_i}^{P_f} (\\nabla V) \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = V(P_f) - V(P_i) $$\nWe can find the potential function $V(x,y,z)$ by integrating the components of the given electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. The components of $\\mathbf{E}$ are:\n$E_x = -Cy^2 z$\n$E_y = -2Cxyz$\n$E_z = -Cxy^2$\n\nThe relationship $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V$ gives us the partial derivatives of $V$:\n$-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = E_x \\implies \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = Cy^2 z$\n$-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = E_y \\implies \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = 2Cxyz$\n$-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z} = E_z \\implies \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z} = Cxy^2$\n\nWe can reconstruct the potential function $V(x,y,z)$ by integrating these partial derivatives.

So, $f$ must be a function of $z$ only, which we can write as $f(z) = g(z)$. Our potential function is now refined to:\n$$ V(x,y,z) = Cxy^2 z + g(z) $$\n\nFinally, we take the partial derivative of this new expression for $V$ with respect to $z$ and equate it to the known expression for $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (Cxy^2 z + g(z)) = Cxy^2 + \\frac{dg}{dz} $$\nComparing this to $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial z} = Cxy^2$, we have:\n$$ Cxy^2 + \\frac{dg}{dz} = Cxy^2 \\implies \\frac{dg}{dz} = 0 $$\nThis implies that $g(z)$ is a constant.
