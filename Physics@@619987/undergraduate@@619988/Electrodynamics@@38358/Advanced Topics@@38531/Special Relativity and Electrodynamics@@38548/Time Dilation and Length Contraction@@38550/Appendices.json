Each nanoparticle has a proper length (or rest length) of $L_0$. The crystalline target has a lattice spacing of $a$. For a specific resonant interaction to be triggered, the length of the nanoparticle, as measured in the laboratory frame where the crystal is at rest, must be precisely equal to this lattice spacing $a$. The design specification requires that the lattice spacing is $a = \\frac{12}{13}L_0$. At what speed $v$, expressed as a fraction of the speed of light $c$, must the nanoparticles be projected towards the target for this interaction to occur? Express your answer as a single simplified fraction.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find the speed $v$ at which a nanoparticle's length appears contracted to a specific value in a stationary reference frame. This phenomenon is described by the principle of length contraction from the theory of special relativity.\n\nThe formula for length contraction is:\n$$L = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\nHere, $L_0$ is the proper length (or rest length) of the object, which is its length measured in the reference frame where the object is at rest. $L$ is the length of the object as measured by an observer in a reference frame moving at a relative speed $v$ with respect to the object. $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n- The proper length of the nanoparticle is $L_0$.\n- The length of the nanoparticle as measured in the laboratory frame, $L$, must be equal to the lattice spacing $a$ for the interaction to occur. So, $L = a$.\n- The relationship between the lattice spacing $a$ and the proper length $L_0$ is given as $a = \\frac{12}{13}L_0$.\n\nWe can substitute the condition $L=a$ and the given relation into the length contraction formula:\n$$a = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\n$$\\frac{12}{13}L_0 = L_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\n\nWe need to solve this equation for the speed $v$ as a fraction of $c$, which is the ratio $v/c$. First, we can divide both sides of the equation by $L_0$ (since $L_0$ is a length, it is non-zero):\n$$\\frac{12}{13} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\n\nTo eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$\\left(\\frac{12}{13}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\right)^2$$\n$$\\frac{12^2}{13^2} = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}$$\n$$\\frac{144}{169} = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}$$\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for the term $\\frac{v^2}{c^2}$:\n$$\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \\frac{144}{169}$$\n\nTo subtract the fractions, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\frac{169}{169} - \\frac{144}{169}$$\n$$\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\frac{169 - 144}{169}$$\n$$\\frac{v^2}{c^2} = \\frac{25}{169}$$\n\nFinally, to find the ratio $v/c$, we take the square root of both sides. Since speed $v$ is a non-negative quantity, we only consider the positive root:\n$$\\frac{v}{c} = \\sqrt{\\frac{25}{169}}$$\n$$\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{25}}{\\sqrt{169}}$$\n$$\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{5}{13}$$\n\nThe required speed of the nanoparticles is $\\frac{5}{13}$ of the speed of light.

The lengths are such that the length of the train as measured by an observer in the tunnel is exactly equal to the length of the tunnel, i.e., $L_T = L_0 / \\gamma$, where $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nAt the exact center of the train is a sensitive explosive device.

Yes, the bomb explodes.

The outcome is indeterminate; whether the bomb explodes or not depends on the specific value of the speed $v$.", "solution": "Let $S$ be the tunnel frame and $S'$ be the train frame. The train moves at speed $v$ in the $+x$ direction with Lorentz factor $\\gamma = \\left(1 - v^{2}/c^{2}\\right)^{-1/2}$. The train has proper length $L_{0}$ and the tunnel has proper length $L_{T} = L_{0}/\\gamma$. At $t=0$ in $S$, the center of the train coincides with the center of the tunnel at $x=0$, and a flash of light is emitted from this point.\n\nIn frame $S$, the positions of the train’s front and rear ends at $t=0$ are $x = \\pm L_{T}/2$. Their motions are described by:\n$$ x_{F}(t) = \\frac{L_{T}}{2} + v t, \\qquad x_{R}(t) = -\\frac{L_{T}}{2} + v t $$\nThe light emitted from $x=0$ at $t=0$ propagates as $x = \\pm c t$.

Because the speed of light is $c$ in all directions in this frame, the light wavefronts reach the two detectors simultaneously at time:\n$$ t'_{\\mathrm{hit}} = \\frac{L_{0}}{2 c} $$\nEach detector then emits an inward signal at speed $c$, which must traverse a distance of $L_{0}/2$ to reach the center.
