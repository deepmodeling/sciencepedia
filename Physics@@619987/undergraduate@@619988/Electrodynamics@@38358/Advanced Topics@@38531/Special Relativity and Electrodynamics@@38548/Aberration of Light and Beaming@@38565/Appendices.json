This problem asks you to determine the apparent position of a light source from the perspective of a rotating observer, a classic thought experiment that tests your understanding of how to apply special relativity locally [@problem_id:1564053]. Solving it requires careful consideration of the observer’s instantaneous rest frame and the direction of the incoming light.", "problem": "An observer is situated on the inner wall of a massive cylindrical shell of radius $R$ that rotates with a constant relativistic tangential speed $v$ about its central axis. A point-like isotropic light source is fixed at the exact geometric center of the shell. The observer sets up a local coordinate system at their instantaneous position. In this system, the direction of their forward motion is defined as the tangent to their circular path, and the \"radially inward\" direction is a line perpendicular to their motion, pointing directly towards the geometric center of the shell.\n\nDue to the relativistic aberration of light, the observer does not see the light source in the radially inward direction.

At the instant the observer detects a photon, set the local axes so that the observer’s velocity is along the S-axis +x (forward/tangential) and the radially inward direction points along +y. In S, the photon that is detected at the observer must have propagated along the straight line from the center to the observer’s location at the detection event, which is the radial line.
