For a very short duration, a potential difference $V_0$ is established between the conductors, with the inner conductor at the higher potential.\n\nThe primary failure mechanism for this component is dielectric breakdown, which is initiated at the location where the magnitude of the electric field is at its absolute maximum. To ensure the reliability of the system, engineers must identify this location. Assuming the cable is infinitely long so that edge effects can be ignored, at what radial distance $r$ from the central axis is the magnitude of the electric field at its maximum?
