This first practice explores a fundamental property of scattered light: its polarization. By considering a linearly polarized wave incident on a small dielectric sphere, you will determine whether the scattering process itself can alter the polarization state, a key insight into the nature of dipole radiation that governs Rayleigh scattering [@problem_id:1603636].", "problem": "An incident plane electromagnetic wave propagates through a vacuum in the positive $z$-direction. The wave has angular frequency $\\omega$ and is purely linearly polarized with its electric field oscillating along the $x$-axis. This wave impinges upon a single, small spherical particle of radius $a$ centered at the origin. The radius $a$ is much smaller than the wavelength of the light, $\\lambda$. The particle is composed of a homogeneous, linear, and isotropic dielectric material with a real-valued relative permittivity $\\epsilon_r > 1$.\n\nConsider the electromagnetic wave scattered by this particle, observed in the far-field region (at a distance $r \\gg \\lambda$). Which of the following statements correctly describes the polarization state of this scattered wave?\n\nA. The scattered wave is always purely linearly polarized, although its plane of polarization depends on the scattering direction.\n\nB. The scattered wave is partially circularly polarized in all directions except for those lying in the $xy$-plane.\n\nC. The scattered wave is purely circularly polarized in the forward ($+z$) and backward ($-z$) scattering directions.\n\nD. The scattered wave is partially elliptically polarized because the spherical geometry necessarily introduces a phase shift between orthogonal components of the scattered field.\n\nE. The partial circular polarization of the scattered wave depends on the value of $\\epsilon_r$; it is only produced if $\\epsilon_r$ exceeds a certain critical value.", "solution": "The problem asks for the polarization state of a wave scattered by a small dielectric sphere. Since the sphere's radius $a$ is much smaller than the wavelength $\\lambda$ ($a \\ll \\lambda$), we can analyze this scenario using the Rayleigh scattering approximation. In this regime, the sphere acts as a single induced electric dipole.\n\nStep 1: Determine the induced dipole moment.\nThe incident electric field at the location of the sphere (the origin) is given by $\\vec{E}_{\\text{inc}} = E_0 \\hat{x} \\exp(-i\\omega t)$, where $E_0$ is the amplitude and $\\hat{x}$ is the unit vector in the $x$-direction.\nA small, isotropic, linear dielectric sphere placed in an external electric field $\\vec{E}_{\\text{inc}}$ acquires an induced dipole moment $\\vec{p}$ that is proportional to the incident field:\n$$\n\\vec{p} = \\alpha \\vec{E}_{\\text{inc}}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the electric polarizability of the sphere. For a dielectric sphere of radius $a$ and relative permittivity $\\epsilon_r$ in a vacuum, the polarizability is a real-valued scalar given by:\n$$\n\\alpha = 4\\pi\\epsilon_0 a^3 \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon_r - 1}{\\epsilon_r + 2} \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is a real scalar and $\\vec{E}_{\\text{inc}}$ is directed along the $x$-axis, the induced dipole moment $\\vec{p}$ must also be directed along the $x$-axis.\n$$\n\\vec{p}(t) = \\alpha E_0 \\hat{x} \\exp(-i\\omega t) = p_0 \\hat{x} \\exp(-i\\omega t)\n$$\nwhere $p_0 = \\alpha E_0$ is the real-valued amplitude of the dipole moment.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the field radiated by the induced dipole.\nAn oscillating dipole radiates an electromagnetic wave. In the far-field (distance $r \\gg \\lambda$), the scattered electric field $\\vec{E}_{\\text{scat}}$ at a position vector $\\vec{r}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{E}_{\\text{scat}}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\omega^2 \\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\exp(ikr - i\\omega t)}{r} (\\hat{n} \\times \\vec{p}) \\times \\hat{n}\n$$\nwhere $k = \\omega/c$ is the wavenumber, $\\hat{n} = \\vec{r}/r$ is the unit vector in the direction of observation, and the dipole moment $\\vec{p}$ is evaluated at the retarded time $t' = t - r/c$. Using the complex form, we consider $\\vec{p} = p_0 \\hat{x}$.\n$$\n\\vec{E}_{\\text{scat}}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\frac{\\omega^2 \\mu_0 p_0}{4\\pi} \\frac{\\exp(ikr - i\\omega t)}{r} [(\\hat{n} \\times \\hat{x}) \\times \\hat{n}]\n$$\n\nStep 3: Determine the polarization of the scattered field.\nThe polarization of the scattered wave is determined by the vector part of the expression, which we denote as $\\vec{V} = (\\hat{n} \\times \\hat{x}) \\times \\hat{n}$. We can simplify this using the vector triple product identity $\\vec{A} \\times (\\vec{B} \\times \\vec{C}) = \\vec{B}(\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{C}) - \\vec{C}(\\vec{A} \\cdot \\vec{B})$.\nLetting $\\vec{A} = \\hat{n}$, $\\vec{B} = \\hat{n}$, and $\\vec{C} = \\hat{x}$, we have:\n$$\n\\vec{V} = (\\hat{n} \\times \\hat{x}) \\times \\hat{n} = -\\hat{n} \\times (\\hat{n} \\times \\hat{x}) = -[\\hat{n}(\\hat{n} \\cdot \\hat{x}) - \\hat{x}(\\hat{n} \\cdot \\hat{n})]\n$$\nSince $\\hat{n}$ is a unit vector, $\\hat{n} \\cdot \\hat{n} = |\\hat{n}|^2 = 1$.\n$$\n\\vec{V} = -[\\hat{n}(\\hat{n} \\cdot \\hat{x}) - \\hat{x}] = \\hat{x} - (\\hat{n} \\cdot \\hat{x})\\hat{n}\n$$\nThe full scattered electric field is:\n$$\n\\vec{E}_{\\text{scat}}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\left[ \\frac{\\omega^2 \\mu_0 p_0}{4\\pi r} \\right] \\exp(ikr - i\\omega t) \\left[ \\hat{x} - (\\hat{n} \\cdot \\hat{x})\\hat{n} \\right]\n$$\nFor any given observation direction $\\hat{n}$, the term $(\\hat{n} \\cdot \\hat{x})$ is a real number (the cosine of the angle between the observation direction and the $x$-axis). The vector $\\hat{x} - (\\hat{n} \\cdot \\hat{x})\\hat{n}$ is therefore a real-valued vector. Let this fixed vector for a given direction be $\\vec{P}(\\hat{n})$.\nThe time-varying electric field at a fixed position is then:\n$$\n\\vec{E}_{\\text{scat}} \\propto \\vec{P}(\\hat{n}) \\exp(-i\\omega t)\n$$\nSince the vector direction $\\vec{P}(\\hat{n})$ is real and fixed for a given observation point, the electric field vector simply oscillates back and forth along the direction of $\\vec{P}(\\hat{n})$. This is the definition of a purely linearly polarized wave.\n\nElliptical or circular polarization requires two orthogonal components of the electric field to have a non-zero, non-$\\pi$ phase difference between them. In the complex notation, this would mean the vector part of the field amplitude would be complex, e.g., $\\vec{v}_1 + i\\vec{v}_2$. Here, the vector part, $\\vec{P}(\\hat{n})$, is entirely real. The complex nature of the field is contained solely in the overall phase factor $\\exp(ikr - i\\omega t)$, which affects all components of the field identically and thus does not introduce any relative phase shifts.\n\nThe direction of polarization, given by $\\vec{P}(\\hat{n})$, does change with the observation direction $\\hat{n}$. For example, observing along the $y$-axis, $\\hat{n}=\\hat{y}$ and $\\hat{n}\\cdot\\hat{x}=0$, so $\\vec{P}(\\hat{y})=\\hat{x}$. The scattered light is polarized along the $x$-axis. Observing along the $x$-axis, $\\hat{n}=\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{n}\\cdot\\hat{x}=1$, so $\\vec{P}(\\hat{x})=\\hat{x} - (1)\\hat{x} = 0$. There is no scattered light in the direction of the dipole oscillation. In a general direction, the polarization vector lies in the plane spanned by $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{n}$, and is perpendicular to $\\hat{n}$.\n\nConclusion: The scattered wave is always purely linearly polarized. The other options are incorrect.\n- B, C, D, E are incorrect because for an isotropic, non-absorptive, small sphere, the polarizability is a real scalar. This ensures the induced dipole oscillates exactly in phase with and parallel to the incident electric field, which in turn radiates a purely linearly polarized wave. No mechanism exists in this model to introduce the required phase shifts for circular or elliptical polarization.\n\nTherefore, statement A is the only correct description.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1603636"}, {"introduction": "Having established the polarization characteristics, we now move to a quantitative description of scattering.
