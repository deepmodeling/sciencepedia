The instrument's moving coil has a moment of inertia $I$, an internal resistance $R_{coil}$, and consists of $N$ turns of wire, each with an area $A$. The coil is suspended by a delicate fiber with a torsional constant $\\kappa$ and is situated in a uniform radial magnetic field of strength $B$. In addition to the electromagnetic damping, the coil experiences a small mechanical damping torque characterized by a coefficient $\\gamma_m$. To prevent prolonged oscillations and achieve a rapid settling time, a shunt resistor with resistance $R_{shunt}$ is connected across the terminals of the galvanometer. The goal is to adjust the total damping to be critical. For an oscillating system, critical damping is achieved when its quality factor, $Q$, is equal to $1/2$.\n\nGiven the following parameters for the galvanometer:\n- Moment of inertia, $I = 2.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$\n- Torsional constant, $\\kappa = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m/rad}$\n- Mechanical damping coefficient, $\\gamma_m = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{s/rad}$\n- Number of turns, $N = 100$\n- Area of the coil, $A = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m}^2$\n- Magnetic field strength, $B = 0.50 \\text{ T}$\n- Internal resistance of the coil, $R_{coil} = 50\\,\\Omega$\n\nDetermine the value of the shunt resistance $R_{shunt}$ required to achieve critical damping.

We need to identify all torques acting on the coil.\n\n1.  **Restoring Torque:** The suspension fiber provides a restoring torque proportional to the angular displacement:\n    $\\tau_{restore} = -\\kappa \\theta$.\n\n2.  **Mechanical Damping Torque:** There is an inherent mechanical friction that opposes the motion, modeled as a damping torque proportional to the angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$:\n    $\\tau_{mech} = -\\gamma_m \\dot{\\theta}$.\n\n3.  **Electromagnetic Damping Torque:** As the coil rotates with an angular velocity $\\dot{\\theta}$, an electromotive force (EMF), or back EMF, is induced in it according to Faraday's law of induction. The magnitude of this EMF is given by:\n    $\\mathcal{E}_{back} = N \\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt} = N B A \\frac{d(\\cos\\phi)}{dt}$, where $\\phi$ is the angle between the area vector and the magnetic field.
