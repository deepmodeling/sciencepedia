We use the Fraunhofer diffraction approximation. The electric field $E(\\theta)$ in the far-field at an observation angle $\\theta$ is proportional to the Fourier transform of the aperture function.\n\nThe aperture is a slit of width $a$. A point within the slit can be described by its $y$-coordinate, $y'$, where $-a/2 \\le y' \\le a/2$. A plane wave incident at an angle $\\alpha$ imparts a phase variation across the slit.
