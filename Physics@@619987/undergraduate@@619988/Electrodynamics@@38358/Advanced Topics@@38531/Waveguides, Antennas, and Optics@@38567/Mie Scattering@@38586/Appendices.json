These particles are suspended in air, which can be approximated as a medium with a refractive index of $n_a = 1.00$.\n\nFor particles much smaller than the wavelength of light, Rayleigh scattering theory is an excellent approximation.

Unpolarized light can be treated as an incoherent superposition of two orthogonal linear polarizations with equal average intensity.
