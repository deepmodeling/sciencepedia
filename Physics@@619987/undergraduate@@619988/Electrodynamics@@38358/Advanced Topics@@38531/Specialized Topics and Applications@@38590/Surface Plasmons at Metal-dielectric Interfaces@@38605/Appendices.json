The Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) propagates along the $x$-axis. SPPs are Transverse Magnetic (TM) waves, meaning the magnetic field vector is perpendicular to the direction of propagation and to the direction of the electric field's variation from the surface. For this geometry, the magnetic field has only a $y$-component, $H_y$.\n\nThe wave propagates along $x$ and decays along $z$.
