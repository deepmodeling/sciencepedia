This phenomenon is known as Debye shielding. For a weakly coupled plasma, the shielded potential $V(r)$ at a distance $r$ from the test charge can be modeled by the Debye-H端ckel potential:\n$$V(r) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{\\lambda_D}\\right)$$\nHere, $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, and $\\lambda_D$ is the electron Debye length, which characterizes the screening distance. The Debye length depends on the properties of the plasma and is given by:\n$$\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_e$ is the electron temperature, $n_e$ is the average electron number density, and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where the temperature of the electrons $T_e$ in the plasma is increased indefinitely ($T_e \\to \\infty$), while the electron number density $n_e$ and the test charge $q$ remain finite and constant.

The potential is given by:\n$$V(r) = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{\\lambda_D}\\right)$$\nThe key to solving this problem is to understand how the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$, behaves as a function of temperature. The formula for the Debye length is provided:\n$$\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}}$$\nWe are asked to consider the limit where $T_e \\to \\infty$. All other parameters in the expression for $\\lambda_D$ ($\\epsilon_0, k_B, n_e, e$) are constants. Therefore, we can analyze the behavior of $\\lambda_D$ in this limit.\nSince $\\lambda_D$ is proportional to the square root of the temperature, $\\lambda_D \\propto \\sqrt{T_e}$, as the temperature $T_e$ becomes infinitely large, the Debye length also becomes infinitely large.\n$$\\lim_{T_e \\to \\infty} \\lambda_D = \\lim_{T_e \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}} = \\infty$$\nNow, we must substitute this result into the expression for the potential $V(r)$.

We need to evaluate the limit of this term as $\\lambda_D \\to \\infty$.\nFor any finite, non-zero distance $r > 0$ from the test charge, the argument of the exponential function is $-r/\\lambda_D$. We evaluate the limit of this argument:\n$$\\lim_{\\lambda_D \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{r}{\\lambda_D}\\right) = -r \\left(\\lim_{\\lambda_D \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D}\\right) = -r \\times 0 = 0$$\nNow we can evaluate the limit of the exponential term itself:\n$$\\lim_{\\lambda_D \\to \\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{\\lambda_D}\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1$$\nFinally, we substitute this limiting value back into the full expression for the potential $V(r)$:\n$$\\lim_{T_e \\to \\infty} V(r) = \\lim_{\\lambda_D \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{\\lambda_D}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} \\times 1 = \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}$$\nThis resulting expression is the standard Coulomb potential of a point charge $q$ in a vacuum. Physically, this means that at extremely high temperatures, the thermal kinetic energy of the electrons is so large that the electrostatic influence of the test charge is insufficient to organize them into a screening cloud. The electrons move too fast to effectively shield the charge, and the potential reverts to its unscreened, vacuum form.\n\nComparing our result with the given choices:\nA. $V(r) = 0$ is incorrect.
