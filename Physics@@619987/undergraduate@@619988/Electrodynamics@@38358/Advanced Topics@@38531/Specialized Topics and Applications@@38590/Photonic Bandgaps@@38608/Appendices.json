This equation has two important scaling properties.\n\n**1. Geometric Scaling**\nIf we scale all spatial dimensions by a factor $s$ (i.e., $\\mathbf{r} \\to \\mathbf{r'} = s\\mathbf{r}$), while keeping the materials the same, the new refractive index profile is $n'(\\mathbf{r'}) = n(\\mathbf{r})$.

Index of Refraction Scaling**\nIf we keep the geometry the same but scale all refractive indices throughout the structure by a constant factor $k$ (i.e., $n'(\\mathbf{r}) = k \\cdot n(\\mathbf{r})$), the new eigenfrequencies $\\omega'$ and wavelengths $\\lambda'$ are related to the original ones by:\n$$\n\\omega' = \\frac{\\omega}{k} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda' = k \\lambda\n$$\nThis is because substituting $n'(\\mathbf{r})=k \\cdot n(\\mathbf{r})$ into the wave equation leads to an eigenvalue problem equivalent to the original one but with $\\omega$ replaced by $\\omega/k$.\n\n**Applying the Scaling Laws to the Problem**\n\nWe can treat the two transformations—geometric scaling and material change—sequentially.\n\n**Step 1: Apply the geometric scaling.**\nThe original structure is scaled down by a factor $s = 0.9$. Let the intermediate wavelength after this scaling be $\\lambda_{\\text{inter}}$. Using the geometric scaling law:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{inter}} = s \\cdot \\lambda_1 = 0.9 \\cdot \\lambda_1\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Apply the material change (index scaling).**\nNext, the materials are changed.

For the index scaling law to be applicable, the refractive indices of all constituent materials must be scaled by the same common factor $k$. Let's check if this condition is met.\n\nWe calculate the scaling factor for the solid component:\n$$\nk_{\\text{solid}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{Si}}}{n_{\\text{GaP}}} = \\frac{3.48}{3.31}\n$$\nAnd the scaling factor for the fluid component:\n$$\nk_{\\text{fluid}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{fluid},2}}{n_{\\text{fluid},1}} = \\frac{1.74}{1.655}\n$$\nLet's evaluate these ratios.

The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, based on the standard transfer matrix method for analyzing periodic dielectric structures.\n\nA photonic band gap consists of frequencies for which no propagating Bloch waves can exist in the periodic structure. The condition for the existence of a propagating Bloch wave with Bloch wavevector $K$ in a one-dimensional periodic structure with period $a$ is given by the dispersion relation, which can be derived using the transfer matrix method.\n\nLet the unit cell consist of two layers with refractive indices $n_1 = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{r1}}$, $n_2 = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{r2}}$ and thicknesses $d_1$, $d_2$. The period is $a = d_1 + d_2$. For a time-harmonic electromagnetic wave with angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ at normal incidence, the propagation through the layered structure can be described by a $2 \\times 2$ transfer matrix. This matrix relates the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields, $(E, H)$, at the beginning of a unit cell to the fields at the end of the cell.\n\nThe transfer matrix $U_{cell}$ for one period ($a=d_1+d_2$) is the product of the matrices for each layer, $U_{cell} = U_2 U_1$, where $U_j$ is the forward-propagating transfer matrix for layer $j$. The matrix for a single layer of thickness $d_j$ and refractive index $n_j$ is:\n$$\nU_j = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(k_j d_j) & -i\\eta_j \\sin(k_j d_j) \\\\ -i\\frac{1}{\\eta_j} \\sin(k_j d_j) & \\cos(k_j d_j) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $k_j = n_j \\omega/c = 2\\pi f n_j / c$ is the wavenumber in the layer, and $\\eta_j = \\eta_0/n_j$ is the wave impedance, with $\\eta_0 = \\sqrt{\\mu_0/\\varepsilon_0}$ being the impedance of free space. Since the problem concerns lossless, nonmagnetic media, this formulation is appropriate. The product of the individual matrices gives the transfer matrix for the unit cell: $U_{cell} = U_2 U_1$.\n\nAccording to Bloch's theorem, for an eigenmode in a periodic system, the fields at the end of a unit cell must be equal to the fields at the beginning, multiplied by a phase factor $e^{iKa}$, where $K$ is the Bloch wavevector. This implies that $e^{iKa}$ must be an eigenvalue of the unit cell transfer matrix $U_{cell}$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix with determinant $1$ (which is the case here as $\\det(U_j)=1$) are given by the characteristic equation $\\lambda^2 - \\text{Tr}(U_{cell})\\lambda + 1 = 0$.\n\nThe eigenvalues are $e^{\\pm iKa}$, and their sum is $2\\cos(Ka) = \\text{Tr}(U_{cell})$. This leads to the dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\cos(Ka) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{Tr}(U_{cell})\n$$\nPropagating waves (real $K$) exist only when the right-hand side is within the range $[-1, 1]$. Frequencies for which $|\\frac{1}{2} \\text{Tr}(U_{cell})| > 1$ correspond to complex $K$, representing evanescent waves that cannot propagate indefinitely. These frequency ranges are the photonic band gaps.\n\nLet's compute the trace of $U_{cell} = U_2 U_1$:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(U_{cell}) = 2\\cos(k_1d_1)\\cos(k_2d_2) - \\left(\\frac{\\eta_2}{\\eta_1} + \\frac{\\eta_1}{\\eta_2}\\right)\\sin(k_1d_1)\\sin(k_2d_2)\n$$\nSince $\\eta_j = \\eta_0/n_j$, the ratio $\\eta_2/\\eta_1 = n_1/n_2$. Substituting this, we define a function $H(f)$:\n$$\nH(f) = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{Tr}(U_{cell}) = \\cos(k_1d_1)\\cos(k_2d_2) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{n_1}{n_2} + \\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\sin(k_1d_1)\\sin(k_2d_2)\n$$\nThe photonic band gaps are the frequency intervals where $|H(f)| > 1$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to find these gaps is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, define the parameters $\\varepsilon_{r1}, \\varepsilon_{r2}, d_1, d_2, f_{\\min}, f_{\\max}$. The refractive indices are $n_j = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_{rj}}$. The speed of light $c$ is given as $299{,}792{,}458\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. A special case is when $n_1=n_2$, which corresponds to a homogeneous medium. In this case, the term $\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{n_1}{n_2} + \\frac{n_2}{n_1}) = 1$, and $H(f)$ simplifies to $\\cos(k_1(d_1+d_2))$. Since a cosine function is always bounded between $-1$ and $1$, there are no band gaps.\n2.  The band edges are the frequencies $f$ where $|H(f)| = 1$, i.e., $H(f) = 1$ or $H(f) = -1$.\n3.  We find these band-edge frequencies numerically. The frequency range $[f_{\\min}, f_{\\max}]$ is discretized into a fine grid. We search for intervals on this grid where the functions $H(f)-1$ or $H(f)+1$ change sign, indicating the presence of a root.\n4.  The `scipy.optimize.brentq` function is used to find the precise location of each root within these bracketing intervals.\n5.  All found roots, along with $f_{\\min}$ and $f_{\\max}$, form a set of boundary points that partition the frequency range.\n6.  For each subinterval between two consecutive boundary points, we check if it lies within a band gap by evaluating $H(f)$ at the midpoint of the subinterval. If $|H(f_{mid})| > 1$, the subinterval is part of a band gap.\n7.  The resulting band gap intervals are collected. Adjacent intervals forming a single continuous gap are merged.\n8.  The lower and upper bounds of each final gap interval are rounded to the nearest $1.0\\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ as specified.\n9.  The final result for each test case is a list of these rounded band gap intervals. If no gaps are found, an empty list is reported.\n\nThis numerical approach is general and robust for any set of parameters.
