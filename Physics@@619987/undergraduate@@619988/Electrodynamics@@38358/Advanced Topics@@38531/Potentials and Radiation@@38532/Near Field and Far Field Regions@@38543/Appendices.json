A detector is placed at distance $r=L$ from the antenna center in a direction perpendicular to the dipole axis. The near-field versus far-field classification is governed by the standard Fraunhofer distance criterion based on the antennaâ€™s largest dimension.\n\nPhysical principle: For an antenna with largest dimension $D$, the boundary of the far-field (Fraunhofer) region is typically taken as\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{FF}}=\\frac{2D^{2}}{\\lambda}.\n$$\nPoints with $r>R_{\\mathrm{FF}}$ are in the far field; points with $r<R_{\\mathrm{FF}}$ are in the near field (with the region $r<R_{\\mathrm{FF}}$ further subdivided into reactive and radiating near-field regions).
