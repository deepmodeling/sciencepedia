For the purposes of signal analysis in the far-field, the beacon can be modeled as a simple oscillating electric dipole with its axis fixed in a known direction. The satellite contains a detector that measures the time-averaged power per unit area (also known as intensity or irradiance) of the electromagnetic waves arriving from the beacon.\n\nInitially, the satellite is at a stable orbital distance $R$ from the beacon. In this position, it records a measurement of the time-averaged power density. Later, the satellite maneuvers into a new, higher stable orbit at a distance of $3R$ from the beacon. The new measurement is taken such that the angle between the satellite's position vector (originating from the beacon) and the beacon's dipole axis is identical to the angle during the first measurement.\n\nAssuming the beacon's power output and frequency remain constant, by what factor does the measured time-averaged power density change from the first measurement to the second? Your answer should be a numerical factor.", "solution": "The problem asks for the factor by which the time-averaged power density from an oscillating electric dipole changes when the distance from the dipole is tripled, while the observation angle is held constant.\n\nThe physical quantity representing the time-averaged power per unit area is the magnitude of the time-averaged Poynting vector, which we will denote as $I$. For an oscillating electric dipole in the far-field (radiation zone), this quantity depends on the distance $r$ from the dipole and the angle $\\theta$ relative to the dipole's axis.\n\nThe formula for the time-averaged power density $I(r, \\theta)$ radiated by an ideal oscillating electric dipole with dipole moment amplitude $p_0$ and angular frequency $\\omega$ is given by:\n$$\nI(r, \\theta) = \\left| \\langle \\mathbf{S} \\rangle \\right| = \\frac{\\mu_0 p_0^2 \\omega^4}{32 \\pi^2 c} \\frac{\\sin^2(\\theta)}{r^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nWe can a group all the terms that remain constant in this problem into a single constant $K$. The problem states that the beacon's properties ($p_0$, $\\omega$) and the measurement angle ($\\theta$) are the same for both measurements.\n$$\nK = \\frac{\\mu_0 p_0^2 \\omega^4}{32 \\pi^2 c} \\sin^2(\\theta)\n$$\nWith this, the expression for the intensity simplifies to:\n$$\nI(r) = \\frac{K}{r^2}\n$$\nThis shows that the time-averaged power density is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source, a characteristic of radiation from a point-like source.\n\nLet's denote the initial measurement conditions with a subscript 1 and the final measurement conditions with a subscript 2.\n\nThe initial distance is $r_1 = R$. The power density measured at this distance is $I_1$.\n$$\nI_1 = \\frac{K}{r_1^2} = \\frac{K}{R^2}\n$$\n\nThe final distance is $r_2 = 3R$. The power density measured at this distance is $I_2$.\n$$\nI_2 = \\frac{K}{r_2^2} = \\frac{K}{(3R)^2} = \\frac{K}{9R^2}\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the factor by which the power density changes. This factor is the ratio of the final intensity to the initial intensity, $I_2 / I_1$.\n$$\n\\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \\frac{\\frac{K}{9R^2}}{\\frac{K}{R^2}}\n$$\nThe constant $K$ and the term $R^2$ cancel out:\n$$\n\\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \\frac{1/9}{1} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\nThus, the time-averaged power density at the new distance is $1/9$ of the power density at the original distance. The factor is $1/9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{9}}$$", "id": "1600154"}, {"introduction": "Unlike an isotropic source, a dipole antenna's radiation is not uniform in all directions; it has a distinct shape.
