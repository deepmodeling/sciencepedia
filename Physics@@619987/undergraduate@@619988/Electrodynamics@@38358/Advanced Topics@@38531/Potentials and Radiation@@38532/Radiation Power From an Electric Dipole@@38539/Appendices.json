As a simplified model, the antenna is treated as a point-like electric dipole oriented along the z-axis. The engineer drives the antenna with a custom waveform generator, causing the electric dipole moment, $p(t)$, to vary in time as a periodic triangular wave.\n\nThe cycle begins at time $t=0$. The dipole moment starts at its most negative value, $p(0) = -p_0$. It then increases linearly with time, reaching its most positive value, $p(T/2) = +p_0$, at half the period. Subsequently, it decreases linearly, returning to its starting value, $p(T) = -p_0$, at the end of one full period, $T$.

To find when the radiated power is maximum, we need to find the instances in time when the magnitude of the second derivative, $|\\ddot{p}(t)|$, is at its maximum.\n\nLet's first express the given triangular wave for the dipole moment $p(t)$ mathematically.\nThe dipole moment goes from $-p_0$ at $t=0$ to $+p_0$ at $t=T/2$. This is a linear function with slope $\\frac{p_0 - (-p_0)}{T/2 - 0} = \\frac{2p_0}{T/2} = \\frac{4p_0}{T}$. The equation for this segment is:\n$$p(t) = -p_0 + \\frac{4p_0}{T}t, \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le T/2$$\n\nThen, the dipole moment goes from $+p_0$ at $t=T/2$ to $-p_0$ at $t=T$. This is a linear function with slope $\\frac{-p_0 - p_0}{T - T/2} = \\frac{-2p_0}{T/2} = -\\frac{4p_0}{T}$. The equation for this segment is found using the point-slope form: $p(t) - p_0 = -\\frac{4p_0}{T}(t - T/2)$, which simplifies to $p(t) = p_0 - \\frac{4p_0}{T}t + 2p_0 = 3p_0 - \\frac{4p_0}{T}t$.\n$$p(t) = 3p_0 - \\frac{4p_0}{T}t, \\quad \\text{for } T/2 \\le t \\le T$$\n\nNow, we find the first time derivative of the dipole moment, $\\dot{p}(t)$:\nFor the first half of the cycle ($0 < t < T/2$), the derivative is the constant slope:\n$$\\dot{p}(t) = \\frac{4p_0}{T}$$\nFor the second half of the cycle ($T/2 < t < T$), the derivative is also a constant slope:\n$$\\dot{p}(t) = -\\frac{4p_0}{T}$$\nThe function $\\dot{p}(t)$ represents a square wave. It is constant over each half-period and abruptly changes sign at $t=T/2$. It also changes sign at the boundary of the period, $t=0$ and $t=T$, where it jumps from $-4p_0/T$ to $+4p_0/T$.\n\nNext, we find the second time derivative, $\\ddot{p}(t)$. This is the derivative of $\\dot{p}(t)$.\nSince $\\dot{p}(t)$ is constant within the open intervals $(0, T/2)$ and $(T/2, T)$, its derivative is zero in these intervals:\n$$\\ddot{p}(t) = 0, \\quad \\text{for } 0 < t < T/2 \\text{ and } T/2 < t < T$$\nHowever, at the points $t=0$ and $t=T/2$ (and by extension $t=T$), the first derivative $\\dot{p}(t)$ has a jump discontinuity. At $t=T/2$, it jumps from $+4p_0/T$ to $-4p_0/T$. At $t=0$ and $t=T$, it jumps from $-4p_0/T$ to $+4p_0/T$. The derivative of a step-like discontinuity is infinite (mathematically, it is described by a Dirac delta function).\n\nTherefore, $|\\ddot{p}(t)|$ is zero almost everywhere but becomes infinite at the exact moments when the slope of $p(t)$ changes. These moments are $t=0, T/2, T, \\dots$.\nThe radiated power $P(t)$ is proportional to $(\\ddot{p}(t))^2$. Thus, the power is radiated in intense, instantaneous bursts at these specific times, while being zero at all other times.\n\nTo answer the question, we must identify the state of the dipole at these moments of maximum power radiation:\nAt $t = 0$: $p(0) = -p_0$.\nAt $t = T/2$: $p(T/2) = +p_0$.\nThese are precisely the moments when the dipole moment reaches its maximum and minimum values, which means the magnitude of the dipole moment, $|p(t)|$, is at its maximum value of $p_0$.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. At the instances when the magnitude of the dipole moment, $|p(t)|$, is at its maximum. This is correct, as shown by our analysis.\nB. At the instances when the dipole moment is zero, $p(t)=0$. From our equations for $p(t)$, this occurs at $t=T/4$ and $t=3T/4$. At these times, $\\ddot{p}(t) = 0$, so the radiated power is zero. Thus, this option is incorrect.\nC. The radiated power is constant throughout the cycle. This is incorrect, as power is zero almost everywhere with bursts at specific points.\nD. At the instances when the rate of change of the dipole moment, $\\dot{p}(t)$, is zero. For the ideal triangular wave described, $\\dot{p}(t)$ is never zero; it is either $+4p_0/T$ or $-4p_0/T$. Thus, this option is incorrect.\nE. The radiated power is zero at all times because the motion is not sinusoidal. This is incorrect. Any accelerating charge or time-varying dipole moment will radiate, regardless of the functional form of the motion, as long as the acceleration (or $\\ddot{p}$) is non-zero at some point.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1600388"}, {"introduction": "Real-world antennas are often driven by signals more complex than a pure sine wave.
