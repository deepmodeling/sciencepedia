The Fermi energy, $E_F$, is uniform throughout the system and serves as the reference energy level.

The energy $\\epsilon$ is positive and represents the electron's energy measured relative to the Fermi level.\n\nAt the interface, the electron undergoes a process known as Andreev reflection. This occurs because single-particle states are forbidden within the superconductor's energy gap. The process involves the incident electron from the normal metal pairing with a second electron, also from the normal metal, to form a Cooper pair. This Cooper pair, being the fundamental charge carrier of the superconducting state, enters the superconductor's condensate, which resides precisely at the Fermi energy $E_F$. The creation of the pair leaves behind an empty state in the normal metal, which propagates away from the interface as a reflected hole.\n\nBased on this description, determine the energy of the reflected hole.

This practice asks you to track the flow of charge during a single Andreev reflection event. Understanding the net charge transfer is crucial for explaining how Andreev reflection enhances the electrical conductance across a normal-superconductor junction, a cornerstone of experimental verification. [@problem_id:1760540]", "problem": "Consider an interface between a normal metal and a superconductor. An electron from the normal metal approaches the interface. The energy of this electron, measured relative to the Fermi energy, is less than the superconducting energy gap. Consequently, the electron cannot enter the superconductor as a single quasiparticle. Instead, a specific scattering process occurs: the incident electron is converted into a Cooper pair that enters the superconductor. This conversion process also involves the creation of a hole that is reflected back into the normal metal from the interface.\n\nA Cooper pair consists of two electrons and has a charge of $-2e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. A hole can be understood as the absence of an electron, and thus it carries an effective charge of $+e$.\n\nBased on the description of this single scattering event, determine the total net charge that effectively transfers from the normal metal into the superconductor. Express your answer as a multiple of the elementary charge $e$.", "solution": "Let's analyze the net change in charge on both sides of the normal metal-superconductor (N-S) interface to determine the charge transferred. We will apply the principle of charge conservation to the process.\n\nThe problem describes a single scattering event. We can account for the charge involved by considering the initial and final states of the charge carriers involved in the process.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the initial state.**\nBefore the scattering event, there is an electron in the normal metal moving towards the interface. The charge of this incident particle is $q_{initial} = -e$. This is the charge from the normal metal that participates in the interaction.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the final state.**\nAfter the scattering event, the state of the system has changed:\n1.  A Cooper pair has entered the superconductor. The charge of the Cooper pair is $q_{Cooper\\_pair} = -2e$.\n2.  A hole has been reflected back into the normal metal. The charge of this hole is $q_{hole} = +e$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the charge balance.**\nThe question asks for the net charge transferred *from* the normal metal *to* the superconductor. This is equivalent to the total charge that is gained by the superconductor as a result of the event.\n\nIn the final state, the superconductor has gained one Cooper pair. Therefore, the change in charge of the superconductor, $\\Delta Q_S$, is simply the charge of the Cooper pair.\n$$\n\\Delta Q_S = q_{Cooper\\_pair} = -2e\n$$\n\nThis value, $\\Delta Q_S$, represents the net charge that has moved into the superconductor.\n\n**Step 4: Verify with the change in charge of the normal metal.**\nWe can also solve this by considering the change in charge of the normal metal. The net charge transferred *from* the normal metal is equal to the negative of the change in the normal metal's charge, $-\\Delta Q_N$.\n\nInitially, the normal metal \"sends\" an electron to the interface, which can be thought of as losing a charge of $-e$.\nFinally, the normal metal \"receives\" a hole from the interface, which is equivalent to gaining a charge of $+e$.\n\nThe total change in charge *within the normal metal's population of charge carriers* involved in the event is the final charge minus the initial charge:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_N = (\\text{charge of final particle in N}) - (\\text{charge of initial particle from N})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta Q_N = q_{hole} - q_{initial} = (+e) - (-e) = +2e\n$$\nA change of $+2e$ in the normal metal means that it has become more positive. This implies that a net negative charge has left the normal metal. The amount of charge that has been transferred *from* the normal metal is therefore:\n$$\nQ_{transferred} = -\\Delta Q_N = -(+2e) = -2e\n$$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The process involves an incident electron (charge $-e$) being replaced by a reflected hole (charge $+e$), leading to a net deposition of charge $-2e$ into the superconductor in the form of a Cooper pair.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2e}$$", "id": "1760540"}, {"introduction": "Finally, we apply our understanding to a more complex scenario that reveals an emergent quantum phenomenon. This exercise challenges you to find the quantized energy levels for a quasiparticle trapped within a normal metal film adjacent to a superconductor.
