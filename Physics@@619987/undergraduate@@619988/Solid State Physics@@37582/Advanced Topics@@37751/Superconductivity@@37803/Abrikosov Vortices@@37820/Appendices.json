Around the normal-state core of each tube, a supercurrent circulates within the superconducting material. The charge carriers in the superconductor are Cooper pairs, each consisting of two electrons bound together, thus having an effective charge $q$.\n\nThe collective behavior of these Cooper pairs can be described by a single macroscopic quantum wave function, $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sqrt{n_s(\\mathbf{r})} \\exp(i\\theta(\\mathbf{r}))$, where $n_s$ is the density of Cooper pairs and $\\theta(\\mathbf{r})$ is the phase. A fundamental requirement of quantum mechanics is that this wave function must be single-valued. This implies that for any closed loop $C$, the total change in phase around the loop must be an integer multiple of $2\\pi$.\n\nThe gradient of the phase is related to the canonical momentum of a Cooper pair. In the presence of a magnetic vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$, this relationship is given by $\\hbar \\nabla \\theta = m_p \\mathbf{v}_s + q\\mathbf{A}$, where $m_p$ is the mass of a Cooper pair and $\\mathbf{v}_s$ is its velocity.\n\nConsider a circular path $C$ that encloses a single, isolated flux tube.
