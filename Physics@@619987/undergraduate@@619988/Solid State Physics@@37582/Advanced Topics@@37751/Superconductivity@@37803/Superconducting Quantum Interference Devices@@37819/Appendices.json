The junction is characterized by its critical current, $I_c$, which is the maximum supercurrent it can carry without a voltage drop. When a non-zero voltage is applied, the quantum mechanical phase difference across the junction evolves in time, leading to fascinating dynamics.\n\nConsider such a junction across which a constant DC voltage $V_0$ is maintained. This results in an oscillating supercurrent $I_s$ flowing through it. Your task is to determine the maximum possible value for the temporal rate of change of this supercurrent, $(dI_s/dt)_{\\max}$.\n\nExpress your answer as an analytic expression in terms of the critical current $I_c$, the applied voltage $V_0$, the elementary charge $e$, and the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum rate of change of the supercurrent, $(dI_s/dt)_{\\max}$, in a Josephson junction with an applied DC voltage $V_0$. The solution requires the use of the two fundamental Josephson relations.\n\nFirst, the relationship between the supercurrent $I_s$ and the gauge-invariant quantum mechanical phase difference $\\delta$ across the junction is given by the first Josephson relation (or DC Josephson effect):\n$$I_s = I_c \\sin(\\delta)$$\nwhere $I_c$ is the critical current of the junction.\n\nTo find the temporal rate of change of the supercurrent, we differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$:\n$$\\frac{dI_s}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} [I_c \\sin(\\delta)]$$\nApplying the chain rule, we get:\n$$\\frac{dI_s}{dt} = I_c \\cos(\\delta) \\frac{d\\delta}{dt}$$\nThis equation shows that the rate of change of the current depends on both the phase difference $\\delta$ itself and its rate of change, $d\\delta/dt$.\n\nNext, we use the second Josephson relation (or AC Josephson effect), which relates the voltage $V$ across the junction to the rate of change of the phase difference:\n$$V = \\frac{\\hbar}{2e} \\frac{d\\delta}{dt}$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nIn this problem, a constant DC voltage $V_0$ is applied across the junction. Therefore, we have $V = V_0$. We can rearrange the second Josephson relation to solve for $d\\delta/dt$:\n$$\\frac{d\\delta}{dt} = \\frac{2eV_0}{\\hbar}$$\nThis shows that a constant voltage causes the phase to evolve linearly with time.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $d\\delta/dt$ back into our equation for the rate of change of the current:\n$$\\frac{dI_s}{dt} = I_c \\cos(\\delta) \\left(\\frac{2eV_0}{\\hbar}\\right)$$\n\nWe are asked to find the maximum possible value of this rate of change, $(dI_s/dt)_{\\max}$. The expression for $dI_s/dt$ is a product of constants ($I_c$, $e$, $V_0$, $\\hbar$) and the term $\\cos(\\delta)$. The phase difference $\\delta$ evolves with time, so $\\cos(\\delta)$ will oscillate. The maximum value of the function $\\cos(\\delta)$ is 1. Therefore, the maximum rate of change of the supercurrent occurs when $\\cos(\\delta) = 1$.\n\nSubstituting this maximum value into the expression, we get:\n$$(dI_s/dt)_{\\max} = I_c \\cdot (1) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2eV_0}{\\hbar}\\right)$$\n\nSimplifying this gives the final expression:\n$$(dI_s/dt)_{\\max} = \\frac{2eV_0 I_c}{\\hbar}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2eV_{0}I_{c}}{\\hbar}}$$", "id": "1806370"}, {"introduction": "The true power of a SQUID emerges when two Josephson junctions are connected in a superconducting loop, creating a quantum interferometer.
