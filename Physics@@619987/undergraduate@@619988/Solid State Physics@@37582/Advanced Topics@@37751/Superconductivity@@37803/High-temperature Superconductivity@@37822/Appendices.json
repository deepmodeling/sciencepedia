This fundamental question lies at the heart of understanding superconductivity as a unique phase of matter. This practice guides you through a crucial thought experiment involving zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) procedures to highlight the Meissner effect—the active expulsion of magnetic fields—as the definitive signature of a true superconductor [@problem_id:1781828].", "problem": "A physicist is investigating the magnetic properties of a newly synthesized superconducting material. The goal is to distinguish its behavior from that of a hypothetical \"perfect conductor\" (a material with zero electrical resistance but without the other properties of a superconductor). The material has a superconducting critical temperature denoted by $T_c$. Two distinct experimental procedures are performed on a sample of this material.\n\n- **Procedure A**: The sample is first cooled from a high temperature ($T > T_c$) to a final low temperature ($T_{low} < T_c$) in a zero-magnetic-field environment. After the sample has stabilized at $T_{low}$, a weak, constant external magnetic field, $B_{ext}$, is applied to it. This procedure is known as Zero-Field-Cooling (ZFC).\n- **Procedure B**: The sample, initially at a high temperature ($T > T_c$), is first placed in the same weak, constant external magnetic field, $B_{ext}$. Subsequently, while the external field is held constant, the sample is cooled down to the same final low temperature, $T_{low} < T_c$. This procedure is known as Field-Cooling (FC).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the expected a-priori results and their physical significance for a true superconductor?\n\nA. A true superconductor behaves identically to a perfect conductor in both procedures. The magnetic field is excluded from the interior in Procedure A and trapped within the interior in Procedure B.\n\nB. In both Procedure A (ZFC) and Procedure B (FC), a true superconductor will have zero magnetic field in its interior. This response is known as perfect diamagnetism and is identical to the behavior of a perfect conductor.\n\nC. The key test is Procedure B (FC). A perfect conductor would trap the magnetic field inside it as it cools, whereas a true superconductor actively expels the magnetic field. This expulsion is the signature of the Meissner effect.\n\nD. The key test is Procedure A (ZFC). A true superconductor will prevent the magnetic field from entering, while a perfect conductor will allow the magnetic field to penetrate freely.\n\nE. The Meissner effect is demonstrated in both procedures. In Procedure A, the field is expelled as it is turned on, and in Procedure B, the field is expelled as the sample is cooled. There is no difference in the final magnetic state.", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the correct statement describing the difference in magnetic response of a true superconductor under Zero-Field-Cooled (ZFC) and Field-Cooled (FC) conditions, particularly in contrast to a hypothetical perfect conductor.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of both a true superconductor and a perfect conductor in each procedure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Procedure A (ZFC - Zero-Field-Cooled)**\nIn this procedure, the material is first cooled below its critical temperature $T_c$ in the absence of a magnetic field.\n1.  **Cooling**: As the material cools from $T > T_c$ to $T_{low} < T_c$ with $B_{ext} = 0$, it transitions into the superconducting state.\n2.  **Applying Field**: A weak external magnetic field $B_{ext}$ is then applied.\n    *   **Superconductor Behavior**: A superconductor is a perfect diamagnet. When the external field is applied, the superconductor generates persistent surface currents. These currents create an induced magnetic field that perfectly cancels the external field inside the material. Therefore, the net magnetic field inside the superconductor remains zero ($B_{in} = 0$). The field is said to be *excluded* from the material.\n    *   **Perfect Conductor Behavior**: A perfect conductor has zero resistance. According to Lenz's law, when we try to change the magnetic flux through it (from zero to some finite value), induced currents will flow to oppose this change. Since the resistance is zero, these currents will persist and perfectly oppose the applied field, keeping the internal flux at its initial value of zero. Thus, the net magnetic field inside the perfect conductor also remains zero ($B_{in} = 0$).\n\nConclusion for Procedure A: Both a true superconductor and a perfect conductor will exhibit zero magnetic field inside. They are indistinguishable in a ZFC experiment.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Procedure B (FC - Field-Cooled)**\nIn this procedure, the material is cooled below $T_c$ in the presence of an existing magnetic field.\n1.  **Applying Field**: At $T > T_c$, the material is in its normal state, and the external magnetic field $B_{ext}$ penetrates it. So, initially, $B_{in} = B_{ext} \\neq 0$.\n2.  **Cooling**: The material is then cooled to $T_{low} < T_c$ while the field $B_{ext}$ is maintained.\n    *   **Superconductor Behavior**: As the material crosses the critical temperature $T_c$, it undergoes a phase transition into the superconducting state. A defining property of this state is the **Meissner effect**, which is the active *expulsion* of magnetic flux lines from its interior. Spontaneous surface currents are generated that push the magnetic field out. The final state is $B_{in} = 0$ (for a Type I superconductor or a Type II in a weak field).\n    *   **Perfect Conductor Behavior**: A perfect conductor, when cooled in a magnetic field, behaves differently. As the temperature drops, the resistance becomes zero, but this does not cause any change in the magnetic field that is already present. According to Lenz's law, currents are induced only when there is a *change* in magnetic flux. Since the external field is held constant during cooling, there is no change in flux to induce any opposing currents. The magnetic field that was inside the material at $T > T_c$ remains trapped inside at $T  T_c$. Therefore, for a perfect conductor, the final state is $B_{in} = B_{ext} \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Compare and Evaluate the Options**\nFrom our analysis, the crucial difference between a superconductor and a perfect conductor is revealed in the Field-Cooled (FC) procedure. A superconductor actively expels the field (the Meissner effect), while a perfect conductor traps it.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n*   **A**: Incorrect. A superconductor and a perfect conductor behave differently in Procedure B. A superconductor expels the field, a perfect conductor traps it.\n*   **B**: Incorrect. While it is true that a superconductor will have zero internal field in both cases (for weak fields), a perfect conductor will *not* have a zero internal field in Procedure B. It will trap the flux. Therefore, their behavior is not identical.\n*   **C**: Correct. This statement accurately identifies that the key distinguishing test is Procedure B (FC). It correctly describes that a perfect conductor traps the field, whereas a superconductor expels it, and correctly names this expulsion as the Meissner effect.\n*   **D**: Incorrect. The key test is Procedure B, not A. In Procedure A, both materials behave identically by excluding the field.\n*   **E**: Incorrect. The Meissner effect specifically refers to the *expulsion* of a pre-existing field upon cooling, which is what happens in Procedure B. While the outcome of Procedure A ($B_{in}=0$) is consistent with superconductivity, the term \"Meissner effect\" is most precisely associated with the FC process. The final magnetic states are indeed different for a perfect conductor, invalidating the premise of identity.\n\nTherefore, the only correct and complete statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1781828"}, {"introduction": "In the laboratory, the transition from a normal metal to a superconductor is observed as a sharp drop in electrical resistance.

This behavior is directly linked to the microscopic nature of their charge carriers—the Cooper pairs [@problem_id:1781790]. This exercise challenges you to connect the concept of the coherence length, $\\xi$, which represents the effective size of a Cooper pair, to the material's tolerance for disorder, revealing why the spatially compact pairs in high-$T_c$ materials are so fragile.", "problem": "Consider two types of superconducting materials, S-I and S-II, both modeled as having a simple cubic lattice structure with a lattice constant of $a = 0.5$ nm.\n\nMaterial S-I is a conventional superconductor with a characteristic Cooper pair coherence length of $\\xi_{\\text{I}} = 250$ nm.\nMaterial S-II is a model high-temperature superconductor with a much shorter coherence length of $\\xi_{\\text{II}} = 1.5$ nm.\n\nBoth materials are prepared with an identical, low concentration of non-magnetic point defects (e.g., atomic substitutions or vacancies). It is observed experimentally that the superconducting properties (such as the critical temperature $T_c$) of material S-II are significantly more suppressed by these defects than those of material S-I.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most direct physical explanation for this observation, based on the provided information about the coherence lengths?\n\nA. The mechanism responsible for the high critical temperature in S-II is fundamentally less stable and more easily disturbed by any form of disorder.\n\nB. In S-I, the Cooper pairs are formed by electrons with parallel spins (triplet pairing), which are immune to non-magnetic scattering, whereas in S-II they are formed by electrons with anti-parallel spins (singlet pairing).\n\nC. The complex, layered crystal structure typical of materials like S-II is inherently more susceptible to damage from point defects than the simpler structure of S-I.\n\nD. In S-II, a Cooper pair is spatially compact with a size on the order of a few lattice constants. A single defect can therefore break the pair by strongly scattering its constituent electrons. In S-I, the pair is spatially extended over thousands of atoms, so the effect of a single defect is averaged out and has a minimal impact.\n\nE. The density of superconducting charge carriers in S-II is much lower than in S-I, leading to less effective electrostatic screening of the defect potential.", "solution": "The problem asks for the primary physical reason why high-temperature superconductors (modeled by S-II) are more sensitive to defects than conventional superconductors (modeled by S-I), given their respective coherence lengths. The key is to understand the physical meaning of the coherence length, $\\xi$.\n\nThe coherence length $\\xi$ represents the characteristic spatial extent or \"size\" of a Cooper pair, which consists of two electrons bound together. The volume occupied by a single Cooper pair can be approximated as $V_{\\text{pair}} \\sim \\xi^3$. Let's compare this volume for the two materials.\n\nFor the conventional superconductor S-I, the coherence length is $\\xi_{\\text{I}} = 250$ nm. The volume of a Cooper pair is approximately $V_{\\text{I}} \\sim \\xi_{\\text{I}}^3 = (250 \\text{ nm})^3$.\n\nFor the high-temperature superconductor S-II, the coherence length is $\\xi_{\\text{II}} = 1.5$ nm.

The number of unit cells within one Cooper pair's volume is $N_I = V_{\\text{I}} / V_{\\text{cell}} = (250/0.5)^3 = 500^3 = 1.25 \\times 10^8$. A single Cooper pair in S-I is a macroscopic object on the atomic scale, extending over hundreds of millions of atoms. A single point defect is a tiny, localized perturbation within this enormous volume. The Cooper pair's properties are an average over this large region, so the effect of one defect is \"averaged out\" and becomes negligible. The pair is robust against such small, sparse imperfections.\n\nIn material S-II, a Cooper pair extends over a volume of $(1.5 \\text{ nm})^3 = 3.375 \\text{ nm}^3$. The number of unit cells within one Cooper pair's volume is $N_{II} = V_{\\text{II}} / V_{\\text{cell}} = (1.5/0.5)^3 = 3^3 = 27$. The Cooper pair in S-II is a very compact object, extending over only a few dozen atoms. If a point defect is located within this small volume, it represents a significant perturbation to the local environment where the two electrons are paired. This strong local scattering potential can easily break the delicate bond of the Cooper pair. Since each defect is highly effective at destroying a nearby pair, a low concentration of defects can significantly reduce the overall density of Cooper pairs, thereby suppressing the macroscopic superconducting state and reducing the critical temperature $T_c$.\n\nThis line of reasoning directly corresponds to option D.\n\nLet's analyze why the other options are incorrect:\nA. This statement suggests that high $T_c$ itself causes instability. This is a fallacious correlation-causation argument. In reality, a strong pairing interaction is thought to be responsible for both the high $T_c$ and the short coherence length $\\xi$. The short $\\xi$ is the direct cause of the sensitivity to defects.\nB. This statement about pairing symmetry is incorrect. Most conventional superconductors (like S-I) are actually s-wave singlets. While triplet pairing exists, it is rare. Many high-$T_c$ cuprates are d-wave singlets. Therefore, the premise of the option is factually wrong and does not provide a correct explanation.\nC. This is a distractor that relies on general knowledge about high-$T_c$ materials. However, the problem statement explicitly specifies that *both* materials have a simple cubic lattice to create a controlled comparison. Therefore, this explanation is invalid for the scenario given.\nE. While differences in carrier density and screening can influence scattering, the effect is secondary compared to the enormous difference in the Cooper pair volume. The ratio of the volumes is $(250/1.5)^3 \\approx 4.6 \\times 10^6$. This geometric factor is the dominant reason for the difference in sensitivity, as described in the problem, making D the most direct and accurate explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1781790"}]}
