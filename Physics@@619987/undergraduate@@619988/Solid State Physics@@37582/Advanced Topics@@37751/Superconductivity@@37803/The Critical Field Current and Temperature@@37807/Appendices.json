This wire is made from a Type-I superconductor with a critical temperature $T_c$. The material's critical magnetic field, $H_c(T)$, is well-described by the empirical parabolic model:\n$$H_c(T) = H_c(0) \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^2\\right]$$\nwhere $T$ is the absolute temperature and $H_c(0)$ is the critical field at $ T = 0 $ K.\n\nThe superconductivity of the wire is destroyed if the magnetic field at its surface, generated by the current it carries, exceeds the critical field $H_c(T)$. This phenomenon is known as Silsbee's rule. For a long cylindrical wire carrying a current $I$, the magnetic field at its surface is given by $H = \\frac{I}{2\\pi R}$.\n\nDuring testing, the team finds that the maximum current the wire can sustain without losing its superconducting properties at an operating temperature of $T_1 = \\frac{T_c}{\\sqrt{2}}$ is $I_1$. Based on this measurement, determine the theoretical maximum current, $I_{max}$, that this wire could carry at absolute zero ($T=0$ K). Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $I_1$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum current $I_{max}$ the superconducting wire can carry at $T=0$ K, given the maximum current $I_1$ at a specific temperature $T_1 = T_c / \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFirst, let's relate the maximum current (critical current, $I_c$) to the critical magnetic field $H_c$ using Silsbee's rule. The magnetic field at the surface of the wire carrying current $I$ is $H = \\frac{I}{2\\pi R}$. The superconductivity is lost when this field exceeds the critical field $H_c(T)$. Therefore, the critical current $I_c(T)$ is the current that generates the critical field at the surface:\n$$H_c(T) = \\frac{I_c(T)}{2\\pi R}$$\nThis gives a direct relationship between the critical current at a given temperature and the critical field at that same temperature:\n$$I_c(T) = 2\\pi R \\cdot H_c(T)$$\n\nWe are given that at temperature $T_1 = \\frac{T_c}{\\sqrt{2}}$, the maximum current is $I_1$. This means $I_1 = I_c(T_1)$. Using the relationship above, we can write:\n$$I_1 = 2\\pi R \\cdot H_c(T_1)$$\n\nNext, we use the given parabolic model for the temperature dependence of the critical field:\n$$H_c(T) = H_c(0) \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^2\\right]$$\nLet's evaluate the critical field at the specific temperature $T_1$:\n$$H_c(T_1) = H_c(0) \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_1}{T_c}\\right)^2\\right]$$\nSubstituting $T_1 = \\frac{T_c}{\\sqrt{2}}$ into this equation:\n$$H_c(T_1) = H_c(0) \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T_c/\\sqrt{2}}{T_c}\\right)^2\\right] = H_c(0) \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2\\right]$$\n$$H_c(T_1) = H_c(0) \\left[1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right] = \\frac{1}{2} H_c(0)$$\nSo, the critical field at temperature $T_1$ is exactly half of the critical field at absolute zero.\n\nNow we have two expressions for $H_c(T_1)$:\n1. From Silsbee's rule: $H_c(T_1) = \\frac{I_1}{2\\pi R}$\n2. From the temperature dependence model: $H_c(T_1) = \\frac{1}{2} H_c(0)$\n\nEquating these two expressions allows us to relate the known current $I_1$ to the unknown critical field at absolute zero, $H_c(0)$:\n$$\\frac{I_1}{2\\pi R} = \\frac{1}{2} H_c(0)$$\nWe can solve this for $H_c(0)$:\n$$H_c(0) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{I_1}{2\\pi R} = \\frac{I_1}{\\pi R}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum current, $I_{max}$, at absolute zero ($T=0$ K). This is the critical current at $T=0$, which we denote as $I_c(0)$. We can find this using the Silsbee's rule relationship at $T=0$:\n$$I_{max} = I_c(0) = 2\\pi R \\cdot H_c(0)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute our expression for $H_c(0)$ in terms of $I_1$ into this equation:\n$$I_{max} = 2\\pi R \\cdot \\left(\\frac{I_1}{\\pi R}\\right)$$\nThe terms $2\\pi R$ and $\\pi R$ simplify:\n$$I_{max} = 2 I_1$$\n\nThus, the theoretical maximum current the wire can carry at absolute zero is twice the maximum current it can carry at the temperature $T_1 = T_c/\\sqrt{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2I_1}$$", "id": "1812415"}, {"introduction": "Beyond predicting behavior, the principles of superconductivity can be powerful diagnostic tools.
