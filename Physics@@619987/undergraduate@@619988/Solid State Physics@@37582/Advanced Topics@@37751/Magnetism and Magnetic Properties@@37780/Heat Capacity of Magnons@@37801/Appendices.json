Understanding this distinction is crucial because it dictates the entire theoretical approach to modeling spin waves in these different magnetic systems [@problem_id:1781121].", "problem": "In the study of collective magnetic phenomena in solids, magnons are quantized spin waves that represent the elementary excitations of a magnetic system. The theoretical framework for describing these magnons, particularly their low-temperature behavior and contribution to heat capacity, depends critically on the nature of the magnetic ordering. Consider the two simplest cases: a ferromagnet (FM), where spins tend to align parallel, and an antiferromagnet (AFM), where neighboring spins tend to align antiparallel. The theoretical treatment of magnons in these two systems begins with a different fundamental assumption about the nature of the ground state.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the foundational difference in the starting assumption used to model low-energy magnon excitations in ferromagnets versus antiferromagnets, based on the Heisenberg model of magnetism?\n\nA. The ferromagnetic ground state, with all spins perfectly aligned, is an exact eigenstate of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, providing a true vacuum for magnon excitations. In contrast, the classical antiferromagnetic ground state (the Néel state of perfectly antiparallel spins) is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, and is thus used as an approximate starting point for the analysis.\n\nB. In both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, magnons are excitations from a classical ground state that is not a true eigenstate of the quantum Hamiltonian. The difference is merely that the energy cost to create a magnon is much higher in an antiferromagnet.\n\nC. The key difference is in the number of atoms per magnetic unit cell. Ferromagnets are treated as having one magnetic atom per cell, leading to a single magnon branch, while antiferromagnets must be treated with at least two atoms (one for each spin sublattice), leading to two distinct magnon branches (acoustic and optical).\n\nD. The fundamental difference lies in the long-wavelength dispersion relation. For ferromagnets, the dispersion is quadratic ($\\omega \\propto k^2$), reflecting particle-like behavior, while for antiferromagnets, it is linear ($\\omega \\propto |k|$), reflecting wavelike, \"phononic\" behavior. All other differences in the theoretical models stem from this fact.\n\nE. The theoretical starting point is identical. In both cases, one assumes a ground state of perfect order (all parallel for FM, perfectly antiparallel for AFM) and calculates excitations. The subsequent mathematical complexity in the antiferromagnetic case is a calculational artifact, not a reflection of a fundamental difference in the ground state's nature.", "solution": "Start from the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian\n$$\nH = J \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} \\mathbf{S}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_{j}\n= J \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} \\left( S_{i}^{z} S_{j}^{z} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(S_{i}^{+} S_{j}^{-} + S_{i}^{-} S_{j}^{+}\\right) \\right),\n$$\nwith $J<0$ for a ferromagnet and $J>0$ for an antiferromagnet (by convention).\n\nFor the ferromagnet, consider the fully polarized state\n$$\n|F\\rangle = \\prod_{i} |S, m_{i}=S\\rangle.\n$$\nIn this state, $S_{i}^{+} |F\\rangle = 0$ for all $i$.

This provides a true vacuum for magnon excitations; single-magnon states generated by $S^{-}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ are well-defined on top of an exact ground state.\n\nFor the antiferromagnet on a bipartite lattice, take the classical Néel product state\n$$\n|N\\rangle = \\prod_{i \\in A} |S, m_{i}=S\\rangle \\prod_{j \\in B} |S, m_{j}=-S\\rangle.\n$$\nNow, on any antiferromagnetic bond $\\langle i \\in A, j \\in B \\rangle$, the flip-flop terms do not annihilate the state:\n$$\nS_{i}^{-} S_{j}^{+} |N\\rangle \\neq 0, \\quad S_{i}^{+} S_{j}^{-} |N\\rangle \\neq 0,\n$$\nbecause $S_{j}^{+}$ acting on $|S, -S\\rangle$ is nonzero and $S_{i}^{-}$ acting on $|S, S\\rangle$ is also nonzero. Hence $H |N\\rangle$ contains components orthogonal to $|N\\rangle$, so $|N\\rangle$ is not an eigenstate of $H$. The exact ground state is not the classical Néel product state (for finite systems it is a singlet), and linear spin-wave theory treats $|N\\rangle$ as an approximate broken-symmetry reference state, requiring a Bogoliubov transformation and leading to a nontrivial magnon vacuum with zero-point fluctuations.\n\nThus, the foundational difference in the starting assumption is that the ferromagnetic ground state is an exact eigenstate providing a true magnon vacuum, whereas the antiferromagnetic classical Néel state is not an eigenstate and serves only as an approximate starting point. This corresponds to option A. Options C and D describe important consequences (two-sublattice structure and long-wavelength dispersion) but do not state the foundational difference in the starting assumption; options B and E are incorrect about the eigenstate nature of the ferromagnetic ground state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1781121"}, {"introduction": "With a stable ground state established, we can now quantify the available excited magnon states at a given energy.
