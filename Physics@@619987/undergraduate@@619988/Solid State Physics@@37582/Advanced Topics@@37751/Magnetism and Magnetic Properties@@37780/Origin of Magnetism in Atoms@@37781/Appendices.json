Determine the values for the total spin quantum number ($S$), the total orbital angular momentum quantum number ($L$), and the total angular momentum quantum number ($J$) that characterize the atom's ground state.

To maximize spin, the Pauli exclusion principle requires the three electrons to occupy the distinct magnetic orbitals $m_l = -1, 0, 1$. The total orbital angular momentum projection is thus $M_L = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0$. Since this is the only possible value for $M_L$ in this state, the total orbital angular momentum must be $L=0$.\n\nThe possible values of $J$ for given $L$ and $S$ are $J=|L-S|,|L-S|+1,\\dots,L+S$. Hund’s third rule addresses the fine structure. For a half-filled shell, such as this one, there is only one possible value for $J$.
