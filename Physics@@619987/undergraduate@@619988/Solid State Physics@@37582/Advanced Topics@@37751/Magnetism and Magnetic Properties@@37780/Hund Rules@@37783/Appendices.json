By first calculating all possible microstates and then applying Hund's rules to find the ground-state term's degeneracy, you will gain a concrete understanding of how these rules select the lowest-energy configuration from a vast pool of possibilities.", "problem": "An isolated, neutral carbon atom in its ground electronic state has an electron configuration of $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. The two electrons in the outermost $2p$ subshell can be arranged in a number of distinct ways, where each unique arrangement of the electrons' quantum numbers defines a \"microstate\".\n\nFirst, determine the total number of distinct microstates possible for this $2p^2$ configuration, taking into account the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nSecond, due to electron-electron interactions and spin-orbit coupling, these microstates have slightly different energies. The set of microstates that share the lowest possible energy constitutes the \"ground-state term\". Calculate the degeneracy of this ground-state term, which is the total number of microstates belonging to it.\n\nProvide your answer as a pair of integers, representing the total number of microstates and the degeneracy of the ground-state term, in that specific order.", "solution": "For a single electron in a $p$ subshell, the orbital quantum number is $l=1$, so the magnetic quantum number can take $m_{l}\\in\\{-1,0,1\\}$, and the spin quantum number can take $m_{s}\\in\\left\\{-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\}$. Hence, the number of distinct one-electron spin-orbitals is\n$$\ng=2(2l+1)=2\\cdot 3=6.\n$$\nWith two electrons in the same subshell and enforcing the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons can occupy the same spin-orbital), the total number of distinct microstates is the number of ways to choose $2$ distinct spin-orbitals out of $6$:\n$$\nN_{\\text{micro}}=\\binom{6}{2}=15.\n$$\n\nTo classify these microstates into LS terms, couple two $l=1$ electrons to total orbital angular momentum $L\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$ and two $s=\\frac{1}{2}$ spins to total spin $S\\in\\{0,1\\}$. For two equivalent electrons, the total electronic wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange.

Antisymmetry requires\n$$\n(-1)^{L}\\cdot(-1)^{S+1}=-1,\n$$\nwhich implies that even $L$ must pair with $S=0$ (singlet) and odd $L$ must pair with $S=1$ (triplet).

The degeneracy of this term, defined as the total number of microstates belonging to it, is\n$$\n(2S+1)(2L+1)=3\\times 3=9.\n$$\nThus, the total number of microstates is $15$, and the degeneracy of the ground-state term is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}15 & 9\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1782343"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals, we now apply Hund's rules to a system with direct relevance in materials science: a rare-earth ion.
