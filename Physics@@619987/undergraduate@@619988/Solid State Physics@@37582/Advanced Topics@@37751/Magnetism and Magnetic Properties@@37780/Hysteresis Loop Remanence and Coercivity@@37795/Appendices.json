This first practice delves into the fundamental origins of magnetic hardness using the celebrated Stoner-Wohlfarth model, which describes magnetization reversal in an idealized single-domain particle. By analyzing the total magnetic energy—a sum of the material's intrinsic anisotropy energy and the Zeeman energy from an external field—you will determine the critical field at which the initial magnetization state becomes unstable. This derivation provides a powerful illustration of how a key macroscopic property, coercivity, arises directly from microscopic material parameters [@problem_id:1783069].", "problem": "Consider a single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticle, a fundamental component in advanced magnetic data storage. The particle exhibits uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, meaning it has a single \"easy axis\" along which the magnetization prefers to align. The magnetic anisotropy energy density, $E_A$, is given by the expression $E_A = K_1 \\sin^2(\\theta)$, where $K_1$ is the positive first-order uniaxial anisotropy constant and $\\theta$ is the angle between the magnetization vector $\\vec{M}$ and the easy axis. The magnitude of the magnetization is fixed at its saturation value, $M_s$.\n\nThe nanoparticle is initially in a state of zero external magnetic field, with its magnetization fully aligned along the easy axis (i.e., at $\\theta = 0$). To reverse the magnetization, an external magnetic field $\\vec{H}$ is applied exactly antiparallel to the easy axis. The magnetization reversal is assumed to occur via coherent rotation, where all atomic magnetic moments within the particle rotate in unison.\n\nThe total magnetic energy density $E$ of the nanoparticle in the presence of the field is the sum of the anisotropy energy and the Zeeman energy, $E = E_A - \\vec{M} \\cdot \\vec{H}$. The coercivity, $H_c$, is defined as the magnitude of the applied field at which the initial magnetization state ($\\theta=0$) ceases to be a stable energy minimum, leading to an irreversible rotation of the magnetization.\n\nCalculate the expression for the coercivity $H_c$ in terms of the material parameters $K_1$ and $M_s$.", "solution": "The total magnetic energy density $E$ of the nanoparticle is the sum of the uniaxial anisotropy energy density $E_A$ and the Zeeman energy density $E_Z$.\nThe anisotropy energy density is given as $E_A = K_1 \\sin^2(\\theta)$.\nThe Zeeman energy density is given by $E_Z = - \\vec{M} \\cdot \\vec{H}$.\n\nThe problem states that the magnetization vector $\\vec{M}$ has a constant magnitude $M_s$ and makes an angle $\\theta$ with the easy axis. We can write $\\vec{M}$ in a coordinate system where the easy axis is the x-axis as $\\vec{M} = M_s(\\cos(\\theta) \\hat{i} + \\sin(\\theta) \\hat{j})$.\n\nThe external magnetic field $\\vec{H}$ is applied antiparallel to the easy axis. Thus, its direction is opposite to the initial magnetization direction ($\\theta=0$). This means $\\vec{H}$ is along the negative x-axis, so we can write it as $\\vec{H} = -H \\hat{i}$, where $H = |\\vec{H}|$ is the magnitude of the field.\n\nNow we can compute the Zeeman energy density:\n$$E_Z = - \\vec{M} \\cdot \\vec{H} = - [M_s(\\cos(\\theta) \\hat{i} + \\sin(\\theta) \\hat{j})] \\cdot [-H \\hat{i}]$$\n$$E_Z = - M_s(-H)\\cos(\\theta) = M_s H \\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nThe total energy density $E$ as a function of the angle $\\theta$ is:\n$$E(\\theta) = E_A + E_Z = K_1 \\sin^2(\\theta) + M_s H \\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nFor the magnetization to be in mechanical equilibrium, the angle $\\theta$ must correspond to an extremum of the energy density.
