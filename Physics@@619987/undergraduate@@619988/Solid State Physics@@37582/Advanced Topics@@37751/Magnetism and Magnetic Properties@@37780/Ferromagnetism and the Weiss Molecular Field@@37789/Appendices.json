The negative sign indicates that the magnetic moment is directed opposite to the spin angular momentum, which is conventional for electrons due to their negative charge. However, in the context of saturation magnetization, we are interested in the magnitude of the maximum projection of the moment along the alignment axis.\n\nThe component of the spin angular momentum along a quantization axis (say, the $z$-axis) is quantized. Its eigenvalues are $S_z = m_S \\hbar$, where $m_S$ is the magnetic spin quantum number, which can take values from $-S$ to $+S$ in integer steps.\nThe component of the magnetic moment along this axis is therefore:\n$$\n\\mu_z = -g \\mu_B \\frac{S_z}{\\hbar} = -g \\mu_B m_S\n$$\nFor complete alignment, we consider the maximum possible value of the magnetic moment component along the direction of the field. This corresponds to the spin state with the maximum value for the spin quantum number projection, which is $m_S=S$.
