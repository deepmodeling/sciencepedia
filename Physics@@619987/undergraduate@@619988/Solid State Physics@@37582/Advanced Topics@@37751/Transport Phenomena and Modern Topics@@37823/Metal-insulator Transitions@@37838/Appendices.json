One of the most fundamental mechanisms for such a transition, driven by electron-electron repulsion ($U$) competing with kinetic energy ($t$), is the Mott transition. This exercise [@problem_id:1789872] explores the heart of this concept by asking you to consider how the electronic density of states evolves from a metallic to an insulating phase, providing a crucial visual model for the opening of a correlation-induced energy gap.", "problem": "Consider a simplified theoretical model of a crystalline solid represented as a one-dimensional chain of identical, stationary atoms. In this model, each atom contributes exactly one valence electron, meaning the electronic energy band arising from these atomic orbitals is half-filled on average. The behavior of these electrons is governed by two competing physical effects:\n\n1.  A kinetic energy term, characterized by the hopping integral $t > 0$, which describes the ability of an electron to move, or \"hop,\" between adjacent atomic sites. This term favors delocalization of electrons across the crystal.\n2.  A potential energy term, characterized by the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U > 0$, which represents the energy cost incurred when two electrons with opposite spins occupy the same atomic site. This term favors localization of electrons, one per site.\n\nThe single-particle electronic Density of States (DOS), denoted $D(E)$, describes the number of available electronic states per unit interval of energy. In the weakly-interacting limit, where hopping dominates ($t \\gg U$), the system behaves as a metal, and its DOS consists of a single, continuous energy band.\n\nThe question is: How does the qualitative structure of the Density of States at and near the Fermi energy change as the system transitions into the strongly-interacting limit, where the Coulomb repulsion is much larger than the hopping integral ($U \\gg t$)?\n\nA. The single continuous band splits into two distinct, narrower bands, separated by an energy gap of approximate width $U$. The lower band is completely filled and the upper band is completely empty.\n\nB. The single band remains continuous but becomes significantly wider. The Fermi level remains within the band, and the system becomes a better metal.\n\nC. A small, indirect band gap opens in the middle of the original band, but the overall width of the DOS distribution remains approximately the same as in the metallic phase.\n\nD. The DOS remains a single band, but it shifts rigidly to a higher energy by an amount proportional to $U$, without opening a gap.\n\nE. The continuous band structure collapses entirely, and the DOS becomes a single, sharp peak (a delta function) at the Fermi energy, indicating that all electrons have the same energy.", "solution": "We model the situation with the one-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian at half-filling:\n$$\nH=-t\\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle,\\sigma}\\left(c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{j\\sigma}+c_{j\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{i\\sigma}\\right)+U\\sum_{i}n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow},\n$$\nwhere $t>0$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping and $U>0$ is the on-site repulsion. At half-filling, there is on average one electron per site. In the weakly interacting limit $t\\gg U$, the single-particle DOS $D(E)$ is a single continuous band with the Fermi energy lying inside the band, i.e., metallic behavior.\n\nTo understand the strongly interacting limit $U\\gg t$, start from the atomic limit $t=0$ and then turn on $t$ perturbatively. In the atomic limit, consider the single-site Hamiltonian with chemical potential $\\mu$:\n$$\nH_{i}=U\\,n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}-\\mu\\left(n_{i\\uparrow}+n_{i\\downarrow}\\right).\n$$\nIts eigenenergies for empty, singly occupied, and doubly occupied states are\n$$\nE_{0}=0,\\quad E_{1}=-\\mu,\\quad E_{2}=U-2\\mu.\n$$\nAt half-filling, one chooses $\\mu$ in the interval $0<\\mu<U$ so that singly occupied states minimize the energy; the particle-hole symmetric choice is $\\mu=U/2$, for which $E_{1}=-U/2$ while $E_{0}=E_{2}=0$.

The many-body DOS, defined as\n$$\nD(E)=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k}A(k,E),\n$$\nhas no $k$-dependence in the atomic limit and therefore also shows two discrete peaks separated by an energy $U$.\n\nTurning on a small but finite hopping $t$ broadens each atomic delta peak into a band with bandwidth of order $t$ (more precisely, of order the noninteracting bandwidth), centered near $E\\approx -U/2$ (lower Hubbard band) and $E\\approx +U/2$ (upper Hubbard band), respectively. The separation between the centers remains approximately $U$, and the broadening is of order $t$, so a charge gap of order $U-\\mathcal{O}(t)$ opens between the two bands. At half-filling, the lower Hubbard band is completely filled and the upper Hubbard band is completely empty, placing the Fermi energy in the gap and yielding a Mott insulating state. Therefore, as $U$ increases past $t$, the single continuous band of the weakly interacting metal splits into two narrower Hubbard bands separated by a gap of approximate width $U$.\n\nThis rules out the other options: there is no simple band widening with better metallicity (contradicting B), no small indirect gap within a single continuous band of the same width (contradicting C), no rigid shift without gap (contradicting D), and no collapse to a delta-function DOS at the Fermi level (contradicting E).
