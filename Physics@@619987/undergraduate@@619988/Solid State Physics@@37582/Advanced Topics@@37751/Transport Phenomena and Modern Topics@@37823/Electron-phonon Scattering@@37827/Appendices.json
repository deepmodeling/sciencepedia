This exercise addresses a core conceptual question: can an electron gain energy from a crystal lattice that is already in its lowest energy state at absolute zero? By analyzing this scenario, you will clarify the distinction between the zero-point energy of the lattice and the existence of real, absorbable phonons, reinforcing your understanding of the quantum ground state and the role of temperature in statistical mechanics.", "problem": "An experimentalist injects a single electron with a well-defined initial kinetic energy into the center of a large, perfect, insulating crystal. The crystal is maintained in its ground state by being held at a temperature of absolute zero ($T=0$ K). The electron can interact with the quantized lattice vibrations of the crystal, known as phonons. After some time, the electron is detected. The question is whether it is possible for the electron's kinetic energy to have increased during its travel through the crystal.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the possibility of the electron absorbing a phonon and thus increasing its kinetic energy in this scenario?\n\nA. Yes, the electron can absorb a phonon corresponding to the zero-point energy of one of the lattice's vibrational modes.\n\nB. Yes, but only if the electron's initial kinetic energy is greater than the average phonon energy in the crystal.\n\nC. No, because the thermal-equilibrium population of phonons available for absorption is precisely zero at absolute zero.\n\nD. No, because any interaction that increases the electron's energy would violate the conservation of energy, as the lattice is already in its ground state.\n\nE. The outcome depends on the crystal structure; in some lattices, absorption is possible at absolute zero, while in others, it is forbidden.", "solution": "We model the system with the standard electron–phonon Hamiltonian\n$$\nH=H_{e}+H_{\\text{ph}}+H_{\\text{int}},\n$$\nwhere $H_{e}$ is the electron Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{ph}}=\\sum_{q}\\hbar\\omega_{q}\\left(b_{q}^{\\dagger}b_{q}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ is the phonon Hamiltonian, and a typical interaction takes the form\n$$\nH_{\\text{int}}=\\sum_{q}M_{q}\\left(b_{q}\\,\\mathrm{e}^{i q\\cdot r}+b_{q}^{\\dagger}\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-i q\\cdot r}\\right).\n$$\nHere $b_{q}$ and $b_{q}^{\\dagger}$ are phonon annihilation and creation operators, $\\omega_{q}$ is the phonon dispersion, and $M_{q}$ encodes the coupling.\n\nAt temperature $T=0$, the lattice is in its ground state, i.e., the phonon vacuum $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ with occupation numbers $n_{q}=0$ for all modes.

The conservation-law argument does not by itself capture the matrix-element nullification that forbids absorption.\n- E is incorrect: at $T=0$ the vanishing of $n_{q}$ is general and does not depend on crystal structure.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1773717"}, {"introduction": "Having established the quantum nature of phonons, we now turn to the \"rules of engagement\" for electron-phonon interactions, which are governed by conservation laws.
