This first exercise invites you to explore the most fundamental case: a one-dimensional metallic chain with a half-filled band.

The atoms are initially arranged in a chain with a uniform lattice spacing of $a$. Each atom contributes exactly one valence electron, which can have spin up or spin down. At sufficiently low temperatures, this one-dimensional metal is unstable and undergoes a Peierls transition, resulting in a periodic lattice distortion and the formation of a charge density wave. Determine the spatial period of this new lattice structure.

What happens when the conduction band is, for instance, one-third full? This problem demonstrates that the period of the charge density wave is not always a simple doubling, but is fundamentally linked to the Fermi wavevector through the nesting condition $Q=2k_F$. By solving this, you will solidify your understanding that the electron density itself determines the periodicity of the new, more complex ground state [@problem_id:1763934].", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical one-dimensional conductor, a long chain of identical atoms with a nearest-neighbor separation (lattice constant) of $a$.

This exercise moves from the cause of the instability to its effect, guiding you through a tight-binding calculation to quantify this Peierls gap. You will see precisely how the structural change—modeled by different hopping integrals $t_1$ and $t_2$ for alternating bonds—directly creates an energy gap $E_g$ at the Brillouin zone boundary, providing a tangible link between lattice structure and electronic properties [@problem_id:1763959].", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical one-dimensional conductor composed of a linear chain of identical atoms.
