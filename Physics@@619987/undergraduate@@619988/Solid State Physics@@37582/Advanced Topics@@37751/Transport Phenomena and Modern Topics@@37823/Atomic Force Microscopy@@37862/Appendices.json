The stiffness of this cantilever, quantified by its spring constant, is a critical design parameter. For a simple rectangular cantilever, the spring constant, $k$, is well-approximated by the formula from beam theory:\n$$k = \\frac{E w t^3}{4 L^3}$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus of the cantilever material, $w$ is its width, $t$ is its thickness, and $L$ is its length.\n\nA researcher wishes to modify a standard cantilever design to make it stiffer, which is often necessary for imaging hard surfaces or for specific dynamic modes of operation. The new design keeps the same material, length, and width as the original cantilever, but its thickness is precisely doubled.

A crucial concept in interpreting AFM data is \"tip convolution,\" where the finite size of the AFM tip broadens the apparent size of sharp surface features. This practice [@problem_id:1761852] provides a hands-on model to quantify this effect, allowing you to see how an ideally sharp step appears when scanned by a real-world, rounded tip. This will give you crucial skills for critically analyzing AFM topography and distinguishing true surface features from imaging artifacts.", "problem": "An Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) creates a topographical map of a surface by scanning a sharp probe, or tip, across it. In an idealized scenario with an infinitely sharp tip, the AFM image would be a perfect replica of the surface. However, real tips have a finite size, which leads to a well-known imaging artifact called \"tip convolution,\" where sharp features on the surface appear broadened in the AFM image.\n\nConsider a simplified two-dimensional model of this phenomenon. A tip with a perfect hemispherical shape of radius $R = 20.0 \\text{ nm}$ is used to scan a surface. The surface consists of a perfectly flat substrate that ends in a sharp, vertical step of height $h = 5.00 \\text{ nm}$. For coordinates $(x, z)$, the surface can be described as being at height $z=0$ for $x<0$, and at height $z=h$ for $x \\ge 0$, with a vertical wall at $x=0$. Assume the condition $h < R$ holds.\n\nAs the tip scans from left to right ($x < 0$ towards $x > 0$), its vertical position is adjusted so that it remains in contact with the surface without penetrating it. The resulting AFM image is the path traced by the apex (the lowest point) of the tip. Due to the tip's shape, the measured profile will show a gradual transition from the lower level to the upper level, rather than an instantaneous jump. The \"apparent width\" of the step is defined as the horizontal distance over which the measured height of the tip's apex transitions from the lower surface level to the upper surface level.\n\nCalculate the apparent width of the step as measured by the AFM. Express your answer in nanometers (nm), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the tip be a circle of radius $R$ in the $x$-$z$ plane, with apex height $z_{m}(x)$ to be determined at each lateral position $x$.
