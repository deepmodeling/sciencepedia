This exercise [@problem_id:1825405] is fundamental for building intuition on the bulk-boundary correspondence, a cornerstone principle where the properties of the bulk material guarantee the presence of states at its edges.", "problem": "A one-dimensional toy model for a polymer is constructed from a finite chain of $N$ identical atoms, where $N$ is an even integer. Electrons can hop between adjacent atomic sites. The structure is dimerized, meaning the hopping integral $t$ between adjacent sites alternates between a strong value, $v$, and a weak value, $w$, with $v > w > 0$. We consider two possible ways to terminate the finite chain:\n\n*   **Configuration A**: The sequence of hopping integrals, starting from the bond between site 1 and site 2, is $v, w, v, w, \\dots, v$. The first bond (between sites 1 and 2) and the last bond (between sites $N-1$ and $N$) are both strong.\n*   **Configuration B**: The sequence of hopping integrals, starting from the bond between site 1 and site 2, is $w, v, w, v, \\dots, w$. The first bond (between sites 1 and 2) and the last bond (between sites $N-1$ and $N$) are both weak.\n\nOne of these configurations is a simple model of a one-dimensional topological insulator, which supports special electronic states called edge states. These states have an energy of exactly zero (relative to the mid-gap) and their wavefunctions are localized at the two ends of the chain.\n\nWhich of the configurations supports such zero-energy edge states, and what is the key physical intuition behind their existence?\n\nA. Configuration B supports edge states. This is because the chain can be thought of as a series of strongly-bonded dimers, with weakly-bonded \"unpaired\" atoms left at each end.\n\nB. Configuration A supports edge states. This is because the strong bonds at the ends provide the necessary condition to confine a state at the boundary.\n\nC. Both configurations support edge states. Any abrupt termination of a periodic potential, regardless of the final bond strength, will create mid-gap states.\n\nD. Neither configuration supports edge states. A finite system of atoms always results in discrete energy levels, none of which can be guaranteed to be exactly at zero energy.\n\nE. The existence of edge states depends on whether $N/2$ is even or odd, not on the termination configuration.", "solution": "Model the chain with a nearest-neighbor tight-binding Hamiltonian on sites labeled by integers $n=1,\\dots,N$:\n$$\nH=\\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} t_{n} \\left( |n\\rangle\\langle n+1|+|n+1\\rangle\\langle n| \\right),\n$$\nwith dimerized hoppings $t_{n}\\in\\{v,w\\}$, $v>w>0$, alternating along the chain.

By the same reasoning, enforcing the right boundary condition $t_{N-1}\\psi_{N-1}=0$ yields a second zero-energy solution localized at the right edge, supported on the even sublattice and decaying leftward with the same ratio $w/v$. In a long but finite chain these two edge-localized solutions weakly overlap; their hybridization produces an exponentially small splitting symmetric about zero due to chiral symmetry. In the idealized topological-insulator picture (or in the semi-infinite limit), they are pinned at $E=0$.\n\nNow contrast with Configuration A, where $t_{1}=v$, $t_{2}=w$, $t_{3}=v$, \\dots, $t_{N-1}=v$.

Hence any putative left-edge zero-energy solution is non-normalizable (and cannot satisfy the right boundary simultaneously), and similarly no right-edge zero-energy solution exists. Therefore Configuration A does not support zero-energy edge states.\n\nThe key physical intuition is the dimer picture: when $v>w$, the system tends to form strongly bonded dimers across the $v$ links. In Configuration B, the chain terminates with weak bonds at both ends, leaving one atom at each end not strongly paired into a dimer. Each such effectively \"unpaired\" boundary site hosts a state whose amplitude decays into the bulk by the factor $w/v$ per unit cell, giving an edge-localized mid-gap state protected by chiral symmetry and the nontrivial bulk winding.
