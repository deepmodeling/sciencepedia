For each discrete value of momentum $k_x^{(i)}$, a quantity known as the Wilson phase, $\\theta(k_x^{(i)})$, is calculated.

The function $\\arg(z)$ returns the principal value of the argument of a complex number $z$, which lies in the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$.\n\n4.

While a detailed numerical procedure is provided, we can determine the result by analyzing the topological properties of the Hamiltonian analytically.\n\nFirst, let's identify the model. The Hamiltonian $H(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is a general form for a two-band model. The specific form of $\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k})$ corresponds to the well-known Qi-Wu-Zhang (QWZ) model, a paradigmatic model for the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The Chern number is a topological invariant that is constant as long as the energy gap between the two bands does not close.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are given by $E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\pm |\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k})|$, where $|\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k})| = \\sqrt{d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2}$. The energy gap between the upper and lower bands is $2|\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k})|$. The gap closes when $|\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k})|=0$, which requires $d_x(\\mathbf{k})=0$, $d_y(\\mathbf{k})=0$, and $d_z(\\mathbf{k})=0$ simultaneously.\n\nLet's find the points in the Brillouin Zone where the gap can close:\n1.  $d_x(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sin(k_x) = 0 \\implies k_x = 0$ or $k_x = \\pi$.\n2.  $d_y(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sin(k_y) = 0 \\implies k_y = 0$ or $k_y = \\pi$.\n\nThus, gap closings can only occur at the four high-symmetry points in the Brillouin Zone: $(0,0)$, $(0,\\pi)$, $(\\pi,0)$, and $(\\pi,\\pi)$. Now, we check the condition $d_z(\\mathbf{k})=0$ at these points for a critical value of the parameter $M$.\n\n-   At $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0)$: $d_z = M - \\cos(0) - \\cos(0) = M - 2$. The gap closes if $M=2$.\n-   At $\\mathbf{k}=(0,\\pi)$: $d_z = M - \\cos(0) - \\cos(\\pi) = M - 1 - (-1) = M$. The gap closes if $M=0$.\n-   At $\\mathbf{k}=(\\pi,0)$: $d_z = M - \\cos(\\pi) - \\cos(0) = M - (-1) - 1 = M$. The gap closes if $M=0$.\n-   At $\\mathbf{k}=(\\pi,\\pi)$: $d_z = M - \\cos(\\pi) - \\cos(\\pi) = M - (-1) - (-1) = M+2$. The gap closes if $M=-2$.\n\nThe critical values of $M$ at which topological phase transitions occur are $M = -2, 0, 2$. These values divide the parameter space of $M$ into different topological phases, each characterized by a distinct integer Chern number.\n\nThe numerical procedure described in the problem statement is a standard method for calculating the Chern number. The phase $\\theta(k_x)$ is the Zak phase (a specific type of Berry phase) accumulated along a 1D path in the $k_y$ direction. The Chern number $C$ is the winding number of this Zak phase as $k_x$ traverses the Brillouin zone from $0$ to $2\\pi$. The sum in the final step of the procedure is a discrete implementation for calculating this winding number.\n\nWe can determine the Chern number for each phase by analyzing the behavior of the vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k}) / |\\mathbf{d}(\\mathbf{k})|$. The Chern number counts how many times the vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$ wraps around the unit sphere as $\\mathbf{k}$ covers the entire Brillouin Zone (a torus). The known results for the QWZ model are:\n-   For $M > 2$: The $d_z$ component is always positive. The vector $\\mathbf{d}$ never points to the southern hemisphere of the unit sphere. The mapping is trivial, so $C=0$.\n-   For $0 < M < 2$: The system is in a topological phase with $C=-1$.\n-   For $-2 < M < 0$: The system is in a topological phase with $C=1$.\n-   For $M < -2$: The $d_z$ component is always negative. The vector $\\mathbf{d}$ never points to the northern hemisphere. The mapping is trivial, so $C=0$.\n\nIn this problem, the parameter is given as $M=1.3$. This value lies in the interval $0 < M < 2$. Therefore, the system is in a topological phase characterized by a Chern number of $-1$.
