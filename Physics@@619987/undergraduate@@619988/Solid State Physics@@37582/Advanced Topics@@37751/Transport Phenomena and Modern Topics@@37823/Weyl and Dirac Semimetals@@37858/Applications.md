## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

In our journey so far, we have explored the strange and beautiful theoretical landscape of Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@article_id:151783). We have met massless electrons, topological charges, and bands that touch in singular, elegant points. But physics is not just a collection of beautiful ideas; it is a description of reality. So, you must be asking: Are these exotic electronic "creatures" real? Do they do anything? Where can we find them?

The answer is a resounding yes! The theoretical principles we have just learned do not live in isolation. They manifest in a stunning array of observable phenomena, connecting condensed matter physics to materials science, chemistry, engineering, and even to the far-flung realms of high-energy particle physics and cosmology. This chapter is our safari into that real world. We will move from the blackboard to the laboratory to see how these ideas are not only verified but also harnessed for future technologies and used to probe some of the deepest questions about our universe.

### Probing the Electronic Soul: Experimental Signatures

How does one "see" a Weyl point? You cannot, of course, put a crystal under a microscope and find a little dot labeled "monopole of Berry curvature." Instead, physicists are clever detectives, inferring the culprit from the tracks it leaves behind.

The most direct footprint of a Weyl semimetal is found on its surface. The bulk-boundary correspondence we discussed guarantees that the topological nature of the bulk *must* create unique states at the surface. Experimentalists can visualize these states using a powerful technique called Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES), which is like a camera for electronic band structures. In an ordinary metal, the electronic states at a constant energy form closed loops, like coastlines on a map. But for a Weyl semimetal, ARPES reveals something that, at first glance, seems impossible: open-ended lines of electronic states that just... stop. These are the famous **Fermi arcs**. An arc starts at the surface projection of a Weyl point of one chirality and ends at the projection of a point with the opposite [chirality](@article_id:143611) [@problem_id:1827872]. Finding these disconnected "roads to nowhere" on the surface of materials like Tantalum Arsenide (TaAs) was the smoking-gun evidence that confirmed the existence of Weyl semimetals [@problem_id:1827864].

We can also probe these materials with more traditional tools, like [electricity and magnetism](@article_id:184104), and still see amazing consequences. Imagine sending a current through a crystal while applying a magnetic field. The electrons are forced into looping, quantized orbits, a phenomenon that leads to oscillations in the material's resistance as the magnetic field is changed. These are called Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. By measuring the period of these oscillations, we can work backward and calculate the size and shape of the two-dimensional [cross-sections](@article_id:167801) of the Fermi surface. For a Dirac semimetal like Cadmium Arsenide ($\text{Cd}_3\text{As}_2$), this technique allows us to precisely map out the pockets of charge carriers that spring from the linear [band crossing](@article_id:161239), confirming their shape and size with remarkable accuracy [@problem_id:1827869].

Even the way these materials store heat is peculiar. In an ordinary metal, the electronic contribution to the specific heat, $C_V$, is proportional to the temperature, $T$. This is a hallmark of a Fermi sea with a sharp surface. But for an ideal Dirac or Weyl semimetal, where the Fermi level is exactly at the touching point, the [specific heat](@article_id:136429) behaves very differently. Because the number of available electronic states grows quadratically with energy away from the node, the [electronic specific heat](@article_id:143605) scales as $T^3$ [@problem_id:1827856]. It is a marvelous thing! The electrons, in their collective behavior, mimic the vibrational modes of the crystal lattice itself—the phonons—which also have a $T^3$ specific heat. The same goes for how they interact with light. The [optical conductivity](@article_id:138943) $\sigma_1(\omega)$ of an ideal Weyl semimetal is found to be proportional to the frequency $\omega$ of the light, a direct consequence of its 3D "light-cone" dispersion [@problem_id:1827851]. These thermodynamic and optical signatures provide bulk evidence for the strange, linear world in which these electrons live.

### The Chiral Anomaly: A Particle Physics Echo in a Crystal

One of the most profound and striking phenomena in Weyl semimetals is a direct echo from the world of high-energy particle physics: the **[chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583)**. In principle, the number of right-handed and left-handed electrons should be separately conserved. However, in the quantum world, symmetries that hold true classically can be "anomalously" violated. In a Weyl semimetal, this manifests in a breathtaking way.

If you apply an electric field ($\vec{E}$) and a magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) *parallel* to each other, you can effectively "pump" electrons from a Weyl node of one [chirality](@article_id:143611) to a node of the opposite chirality [@problem_id:1827855]. The parallel fields open a channel, and electrons flow between the left- and right-handed worlds. This is not just a theoretical curiosity; it leads to a bizarre and easily measured electrical signal.

Normally, applying a magnetic field to a metal makes it more resistive, because the field forces electrons into circular paths, hindering their forward motion. This is positive [magnetoresistance](@article_id:265280). But in a Weyl semimetal with parallel $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{B}$, the [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583) creates an *additional* contribution to the current. The more you increase the magnetic field, the faster the chiral pumping, which in turn creates a larger anomalous current. This extra current *adds* to the normal current, causing the total resistance to *decrease*. This effect, a large **[negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@article_id:146235)**, is a key transport signature of the [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583) in a Weyl semimetal [@problem_id:1827825]. Seeing the resistance of a material drop as you crank up the magnetic field is a beautiful and counter-intuitive confirmation of this deep quantum field theoretical effect happening inside a humble crystal.

### Harnessing Topology: Switches, Tunnels, and Designer Devices

The very existence of Dirac and Weyl points is tethered to the symmetries of the crystal. A Dirac point is often a delicate creature, protected by a combination of symmetries, like time-reversal and spatial inversion. What happens if you poke it? What if you break one of its protecting symmetries?

You can, for instance, apply a **magnetic field**. A magnetic field is odd under time-reversal, so it breaks that symmetry. Doing so splits a single four-fold degenerate Dirac point into a pair of two-fold degenerate Weyl points, separated in [momentum space](@article_id:148442) [@problem_id:1827854]. Alternatively, you can physically **squeeze** or **stretch** the crystal. Applying such a strain can break the crystal's inversion symmetry, and this too is enough to split the Dirac point into a pair of Weyl points [@problem_id:1827]. This ability to switch a material between a Dirac and a Weyl state using external fields opens up tantalizing possibilities for "[topological electronics](@article_id:140854)," where information could be stored or processed not by the flow of charge, but by the topological state of the material itself.

The adventure continues when we consider how these "relativistic" electrons move. Because they are described by an equation analogous to the Dirac equation for massless particles, they exhibit a phenomenon known as **Klein tunneling**. If you set up a potential barrier that would classically reflect any incoming electron, a normally incident Weyl electron just sails right through with 100% probability, regardless of how high the barrier is [@problem_id:1827859]! This perfect transmission is a direct consequence of chirality conservation. This robustness to scattering suggests that devices built from these materials could be extraordinarily efficient.

We are even learning to build these materials from the ground up, with desired properties. One can imagine constructing a 3D Dirac semimetal by simply stacking layers of a 2D gapped material, like gapped graphene. If the coupling between layers is strong enough, the gap can be forced to close at specific points in the out-of-plane momentum direction, giving birth to 3D Dirac points [@problem_id:1827834]. This "atomic-scale engineering" allows us to design topological materials on demand. We can then interface these designer materials with others, like [superconductors](@article_id:136316). A Josephson junction, where two [superconductors](@article_id:136316) are separated by a thin slice of Dirac semimetal, exhibits a supercurrent whose maximum value (the [critical current](@article_id:136191)) is directly controlled by the properties of the semimetal, such as its number of conducting channels, which in turn is dictated by its Fermi surface [@problem_id:1122816]. Such hybrid devices could form the building blocks of future quantum computers.

### A Cosmic Symphony in a Solid

Perhaps the most thrilling aspect of this field is its deep connection to the fundamental laws of nature. Weyl semimetals have become a kind of "[wind tunnel](@article_id:184502)" for physicists, allowing them to create and test ideas from particle physics and cosmology on a laboratory tabletop.

Consider the **chiral vortical effect**. It predicts that if you take a fluid of chiral fermions and simply rotate it, a current will flow along the [axis of rotation](@article_id:186600). This effect is thought to play a role in the [quark-gluon plasma](@article_id:137007) of the early universe. In a stunning demonstration of the unity of physics, the same effect is predicted to occur in a Weyl semimetal. A crystal of a Weyl semimetal, if physically rotated, can generate a real electrical current due to the coupling between its chiral electrons and the mechanical rotation [@problem_id:1122833].

The connections go even deeper. The electromagnetic response in some of these materials is described by a modified version of Maxwell's equations, which includes a so-called "[axion](@article_id:156014)" term, $\theta \vec{E} \cdot \vec{B}$. This is the same mathematics used to describe the hypothetical axion, a particle candidate for dark matter. This topological term has a dramatic consequence known as the **Witten effect**. It predicts that a [magnetic monopole](@article_id:148635), if it existed, would bind to itself an electric charge proportional to the [axion angle](@article_id:138926) $\theta$. While we cannot find a fundamental magnetic monopole in vacuum, a Weyl point acts as one in [momentum space](@article_id:148442). In the real space of the crystal, if you could somehow place a magnetic monopole inside, the [axion](@article_id:156014) term would cause the material to respond by [cloaking](@article_id:196953) the monopole in a cloud of real electric charge [@problem_id:1239167].

It is a humbling and inspiring realization. The same deep mathematical structures that govern the cosmos at its largest scales and the subatomic world at its smallest also orchestrate the dance of electrons in a crystal. The study of thesematerials is not just a search for the next-generation transistor; it is a journey into the fundamental workings of the universe, played out in a piece of solid matter you can hold in your hand.
