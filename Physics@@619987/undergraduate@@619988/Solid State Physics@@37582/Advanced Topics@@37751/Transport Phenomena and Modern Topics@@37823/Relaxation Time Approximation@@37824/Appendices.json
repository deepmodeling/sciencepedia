This foundational exercise [@problem_id:1800097] guides you through deriving the probability of an electron scattering, starting from the core assumption of a constant collision probability per unit time, $1/\\tau$. Understanding this statistical origin is crucial for appreciating why exponential decay models are so prevalent in transport phenomena.", "problem": "In the Drude model for electron transport in metals, a key simplifying assumption is that an electron moves freely between collisions, and that each collision event \"resets\" the electron's velocity. We can characterize the frequency of these collisions by a constant probability per unit time, which we denote as $1/\\tau$. Here, $\\tau$ is a parameter known as the relaxation time or mean free time between collisions.\n\nConsider an electron that has just experienced a collision at time $t=0$. The probability that this electron will experience another collision within an infinitesimally small time interval $dt$ is given by $dt/\\tau$. Based on this premise, determine a general expression for the probability that this electron will undergo its next collision at some point in time *before* a specific moment $t_0$.\n\nYour answer should be an analytic expression in terms of $t_0$ and the relaxation time $\\tau$.", "solution": "Let $P_s(t)$ be the probability that an electron survives for a duration $t$ without undergoing a collision, given that it just had a collision at $t=0$.\n\nWe are interested in the probability that the electron survives until time $t+dt$. For this to happen, two independent events must occur:\n1. The electron must have survived without scattering up to time $t$. The probability for this is $P_s(t)$.\n2. The electron must not scatter in the subsequent infinitesimal time interval from $t$ to $t+dt$.\n\nThe problem states that the probability of scattering in an interval $dt$ is $dt/\\tau$. Therefore, the probability of *not* scattering in this interval is $(1 - dt/\\tau)$.\n\nSince these events are independent, we can multiply their probabilities to find the probability of surviving until $t+dt$:\n$$P_s(t+dt) = P_s(t) \\left(1 - \\frac{dt}{\\tau}\\right)$$\n\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n$$P_s(t+dt) - P_s(t) = -P_s(t) \\frac{dt}{\\tau}$$\n\nDividing both sides by $dt$:\n$$\\frac{P_s(t+dt) - P_s(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{P_s(t)}{\\tau}$$\n\nTaking the limit as $dt \\to 0$, the left side becomes the definition of the derivative of $P_s(t)$ with respect to time:\n$$\\frac{dP_s(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} P_s(t)$$\n\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$\\frac{dP_s}{P_s} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} dt$$\n\nNow, we integrate both sides. We integrate the probability from its initial value at $t=0$ to its value at a general time $t$, and the time from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\\int_{P_s(0)}^{P_s(t)} \\frac{dP_s'}{P_s'} = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{1}{\\tau} dt'$$\n\nAt $t=0$, the electron has had no time to scatter yet, so the probability of having survived up to that point is 1. Thus, our initial condition is $P_s(0)=1$.\n$$\\int_{1}^{P_s(t)} \\frac{dP_s'}{P_s'} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{t} dt'$$\n\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$[\\ln(P_s')]_{1}^{P_s(t)} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} [t']_{0}^{t}$$\n$$\\ln(P_s(t)) - \\ln(1) = -\\frac{t}{\\tau}$$\n$$\\ln(P_s(t)) = -\\frac{t}{\\tau}$$\n\nExponentiating both sides gives the survival probability as a function of time:\n$$P_s(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the electron will undergo its next collision *before* time $t_0$. This event is the logical complement of the electron surviving *at least until* time $t_0$. The probability of the latter is $P_s(t_0)$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of scattering before $t_0$, which we can call $P_{scat}(t  t_0)$, is given by:\n$$P_{scat}(t  t_0) = 1 - P_s(t_0)$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the survival probability, we get:\n$$P_{scat}(t  t_0) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_0}{\\tau}\\right)$$\n\nThis is the final expression for the probability of the next collision occurring before time $t_0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_0}{\\tau}\\right)}$$", "id": "1800097"}, {"introduction": "With the statistical basis established, we can now apply the relaxation time concept to calculate a key macroscopic transport property: electron mobility, $\\mu$.
