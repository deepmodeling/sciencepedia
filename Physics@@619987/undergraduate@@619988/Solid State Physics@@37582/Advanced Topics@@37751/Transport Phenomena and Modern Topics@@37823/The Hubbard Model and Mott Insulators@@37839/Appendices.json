The lattice is occupied by $N$ electrons, forming a half-filled band. The behavior of these electrons is described by the Hubbard model, with the Hamiltonian given by $H = H_0 + V$. The term $H_0$ represents the kinetic energy of the electrons (their ability to hop between sites), and its ground state, denoted as $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$, is the standard non-interacting Fermi sea. The term $V$ represents the on-site Coulomb interaction, given by:\n$$V = U \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow}$$\nHere, $U$ is a positive constant representing the energy cost of placing two electrons on the same site. The index $i$ runs over all lattice sites from $1$ to $N$. The operator $n_{i\\sigma} = c^\\dagger_{i\\sigma} c_{i\\sigma}$ is the number operator for an electron with spin $\\sigma \\in \\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$ at site $i$, where $c^\\dagger_{i\\sigma}$ and $c_{i\\sigma}$ are the corresponding fermionic creation and annihilation operators.\n\nIn the limit of a large number of sites $N$, the non-interacting ground state $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$ can be considered spatially uniform, meaning the average number of electrons of a given spin is the same for every site.\n\nAssuming that the interaction energy $U$ is small, it can be treated as a perturbation to the non-interacting system. Calculate the first-order correction to the ground state energy *per site* due to this interaction. Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $U$.", "solution": "According to first-order non-degenerate perturbation theory, the correction to the ground state energy, $E^{(1)}$, is given by the expectation value of the perturbation Hamiltonian $V$ in the unperturbed ground state $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$.\n\n$$E^{(1)} = \\langle \\Psi_0 | V | \\Psi_0 \\rangle$$\n\nThe perturbation Hamiltonian is given as $V = U \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow}$.

In this state, the electrons of different spins are uncorrelated. Therefore, the expectation value of the product of the two number operators is equal to the product of their individual expectation values:\n\n$$\\langle \\Psi_0 | n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow} | \\Psi_0 \\rangle = \\langle \\Psi_0 | n_{i\\uparrow} | \\Psi_0 \\rangle \\langle \\Psi_0 | n_{i\\downarrow} | \\Psi_0 \\rangle$$\n\nLet's denote the average occupation numbers as $\\langle n_{i\\uparrow} \\rangle = \\langle \\Psi_0 | n_{i\\uparrow} | \\Psi_0 \\rangle$ and $\\langle n_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle = \\langle \\Psi_0 | n_{i\\downarrow} | \\Psi_0 \\rangle$.\n\nThe system has $N$ sites and $N$ electrons (half-filling). In the ground state of a non-magnetic system, there will be an equal number of spin-up and spin-down electrons. Thus, the number of spin-up electrons is $N_\\uparrow = N/2$, and the number of spin-down electrons is $N_\\downarrow = N/2$.\n\nThe problem states that the non-interacting ground state is spatially uniform. This means the probability of finding an electron of a given spin is the same at every site $i$.

Each site can be empty (0), occupied by a spin-up electron ($\\uparrow$), or a spin-down electron ($\\downarrow$). For two electrons, we must place them in the four available spin-orbitals (site 1-up, site 1-down, site 2-up, site 2-down).
