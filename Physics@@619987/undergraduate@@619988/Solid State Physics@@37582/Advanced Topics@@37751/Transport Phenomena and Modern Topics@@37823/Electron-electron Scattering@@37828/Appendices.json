For a non-interacting electronic system, such as a ballistic Quantum Point Contact (QPC), the Pauli exclusion principle leads to anti-bunching of electrons, resulting in a suppressed Fano factor $F < 1$. This problem explores a simplified model for how strong inelastic electron-electron interactions might alter this behavior by inducing bunching.\n\nConsider a model for a QPC where spinless electrons arrive sequentially. An incoming electron has a probability $p$ to initiate a \"pairing event\" and a probability $1-p$ to undergo a \"single event\".\n- In a **single event**, the electron attempts to transmit through the contact with a probability $T_1$.\n- In a **pairing event**, the electron is held at the contact, waiting for the next electron to arrive. The two electrons then form a temporary pair. This pair is treated as a single entity for the transmission attempt. The probability that the pair successfully transmits (meaning both electrons pass through the contact) is $T_2$. If the transmission fails, both electrons are reflected.\n\nThis bunching of electrons into pairs is a consequence of interactions. However, assume that the transmission process for the two electrons within a pair can be treated as two independent quantum events. This implies that the probability of the pair successfully transmitting is related to the single-particle transmission probability by $T_2 = T_1^2$.\n\nYour task is to analyze the noise properties of this system.

Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "With maximal pairing $p=1$, electrons always form pairs before attempting transmission. Each transmission attempt (one “trial”) thus involves a charge quantum $q_{0}=2e$:\n- With probability $T_{2}$, the pair transmits and a charge $Q=2e$ is transferred.\n- With probability $1-T_{2}$, the pair is reflected and $Q=0$.\n\nTreating successive trials as independent, this is a Bernoulli process with charge quanta.
