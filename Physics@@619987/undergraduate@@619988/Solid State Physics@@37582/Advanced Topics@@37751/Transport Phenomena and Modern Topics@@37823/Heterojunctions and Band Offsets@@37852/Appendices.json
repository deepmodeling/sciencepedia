Both semiconductors have the same doping concentration.\n\n- **Semiconductor 1 (narrow-gap, denoted 'n')** has a band gap of $E_{g1}$ and an electron affinity of $\\chi_1$.\n- **Semiconductor 2 (wide-gap, denoted 'N')** has a band gap of $E_{g2}$ and an electron affinity of $\\chi_2$.\n\nIt is known that $E_{g2} > E_{g1}$ and $\\chi_1 > \\chi_2$. The two materials are brought into contact, and the system reaches thermal equilibrium, causing their Fermi levels to align. Due to the difference in electron affinities, a discontinuity, $\\Delta E_c = \\chi_1 - \\chi_2$, appears in the conduction band at the interface. Similarly, a discontinuity, $\\Delta E_v = (E_{g2} - E_{g1}) - \\Delta E_c$, appears in the valence band.\n\nAt the interface, the alignment of the conduction bands can form one of two features: a \"spike\" (a potential barrier) or a \"notch\" (a potential well).\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly describes the conduction band feature at the junction and its effect on electron transport from Semiconductor 1 to Semiconductor 2?\n\nA. A notch is formed, which acts as a trap for electrons and impedes their flow across the junction.\n\nB.

On an absolute energy scale referenced to the vacuum level $E_{\\text{vac}}$, the conduction band minimum of semiconductor $i$ is\n$$\nE_{C,i}=E_{\\text{vac}}-\\chi_{i}.\n$$\nWhen two semiconductors are joined and reach thermal equilibrium, their Fermi levels align, and a fixed conduction band discontinuity appears at the interface given by\n$$\n\\Delta E_{c}=E_{C,2}-E_{C,1}=\\chi_{1}-\\chi_{2}.\n$$\nGiven $\\chi_{1}>\\chi_{2}$, it follows that\n$$\n\\Delta E_{c}=\\chi_{1}-\\chi_{2}>0,\n$$\nso that $E_{C,2}>E_{C,1}$ at the interface. Thus, moving from Semiconductor 1 (narrow-gap, denoted $n$) to Semiconductor 2 (wide-gap, denoted $N$), the conduction band edge steps upward by $\\Delta E_{c}$, forming a spike (a potential barrier). The valence band discontinuity is\n$$\n\\Delta E_{v}=(E_{g2}-E_{g1})-\\Delta E_{c},\n$$\nwhich is consistent with the total bandgap difference being partitioned between the conduction and valence band offsets, but its sign is not needed to determine the conduction-band feature.\n\nBecause the conduction band edge rises by $\\Delta E_{c}>0$ when going from 1 to 2, electrons originating in Semiconductor 1 encounter an energy barrier at the interface. Therefore, electron transport from 1 to 2 is impeded unless carriers have sufficient energy (e.g., via thermionic emission) or tunnel through the barrier. This corresponds to a conduction-band spike that impedes electron flow.\n\nHence, the correct statement is that a spike forms and it acts as a potential barrier impeding electron flow across the junction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1781384"}, {"introduction": "Building on the qualitative picture, we now turn to quantifying the band alignment.
