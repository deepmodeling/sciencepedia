A key feature observed in the energy spectrum of the photoelectrons is the \"Fermi edge.\" This sharp cutoff represents the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons, which are those that originated from the material's Fermi level.\n\nSubsequently, the physicist switches the light source to a frequency-quadrupled Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, which is a source of Ultraviolet (UV) light.
