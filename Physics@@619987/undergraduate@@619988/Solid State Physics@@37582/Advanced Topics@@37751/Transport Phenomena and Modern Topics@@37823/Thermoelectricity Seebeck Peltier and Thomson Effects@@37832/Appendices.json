Mastering this concept is key to accurately characterizing and modeling the performance of thermoelectric coolers and generators.", "problem": "A researcher is characterizing a small thermoelectric cooler (TEC) designed to stabilize the temperature of a sensitive sensor in a vacuum chamber. The \"hot side\" of the TEC is attached to a large heat sink, maintaining it at a constant temperature. The sensor is attached to the \"cold side\". The total electrical resistance of the TEC is measured to be $R = 0.80 \\, \\Omega$. To determine the Peltier coefficient, $\\Pi$, of the junction at the operating temperature, two experiments are performed. In both experiments, a current is passed through the TEC, and the power that must be dissipated from the sensor to its surroundings (e.g., via thermal radiation) to keep the sensor's temperature constant is measured.\n\nExperiment 1: A current of $I_0 = 3.0 \\, \\text{A}$ is passed through the TEC in the direction that nominally produces a cooling effect. The required power dissipation from the sensor is measured to be $P_1 = 2.85 \\, \\text{W}$.\n\nExperiment 2: The direction of the current is reversed, while its magnitude is kept the same ($I = -I_0$). The required power dissipation from the sensor is now measured to be $P_2 = 4.35 \\, \\text{W}$.\n\nAssume a simple model where the net rate of heat removed from the cold side by the TEC, $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{net}}$, is given by the algebraic sum of the Peltier cooling rate and the Joule heating contribution at the cold junction. The Peltier effect contributes a term $\\Pi I$, where $I$ is the electric current (positive for the cooling direction).
