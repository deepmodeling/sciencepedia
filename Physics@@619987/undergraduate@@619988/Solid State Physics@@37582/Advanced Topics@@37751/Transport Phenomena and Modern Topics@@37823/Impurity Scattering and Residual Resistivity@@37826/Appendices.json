This resistivity arises from the scattering of conduction electrons off the disordered arrangement of the two different types of atoms in the crystal lattice.

To ensure all contributions to resistivity are accounted for, they decide to calculate the theoretical contribution from impurity scattering, as described by Nordheim's rule.\n\nConsidering the pure copper sample as a limiting case of a binary alloy, what is the value of the residual resistivity, $\\rho_{res}$, predicted by Nordheim's rule? Express your answer in units of nano-ohm-meters ($n\\Omega \\cdot m$).", "solution": "The problem asks for the residual resistivity, $\\rho_{res}$, of a pure copper sample as predicted by Nordheim's rule.\n\nNordheim's rule is given by the formula:\n$$ \\rho_{res} = A \\cdot x(1-x) $$\nHere, $\\rho_{res}$ is the contribution to resistivity from alloy disorder scattering. The variable $x$ represents the atomic fraction of one of the two components in a binary alloy, and $(1-x)$ represents the atomic fraction of the second component. The constant $A$ is a characteristic of the specific alloy system, quantifying the scattering potential difference between the two types of atoms.\n\nThere are two ways to approach this problem: one based on physical reasoning and another based on mathematical application of the formula.\n\n**Method 1: Physical Reasoning**\nNordheim's rule is fundamentally a model for the resistivity caused by *disorder*. Specifically, it models the disruption to the perfect periodicity of the crystal lattice when atoms of a second element are introduced. The term $x(1-x)$ in the formula reaches its maximum at $x=0.5$ (a 50-50 alloy), which corresponds to the maximum possible atomic disorder.\n\nIn the given scenario, the sample is 100% pure copper. This means there is only one type of atom present. A perfect crystal of a single element has a perfectly periodic lattice potential (at zero temperature). There are no \"impurity\" atoms to create the disorder that Nordheim's rule describes. Therefore, the scattering mechanism modeled by Nordheim's rule is absent. Consequently, the contribution to resistivity from this specific mechanism must be zero.\n\n**Method 2: Mathematical Application**\nWe can treat the pure copper sample as a limiting case of a binary alloy. Let's imagine an alloy of metal 1 (Copper) and metal 2 (some other element, say Zinc). The atomic fraction of metal 2 is denoted by $x$.\n\nFor a sample of 100% pure copper, the atomic fraction of any other element (the \"impurity\") is zero. Therefore, we can set $x=0$.\nSubstituting $x=0$ into Nordheim's rule:\n$$ \\rho_{res} = A \\cdot (0)(1-0) $$\n$$ \\rho_{res} = A \\cdot 0 $$\n$$ \\rho_{res} = 0 $$\n\nAlternatively, we could define $x$ as the atomic fraction of copper itself. In a pure copper sample, the atomic fraction of copper is 1. So, we set $x=1$.\nSubstituting $x=1$ into Nordheim's rule:\n$$ \\rho_{res} = A \\cdot (1)(1-1) $$\n$$ \\rho_{res} = A \\cdot 0 $$\n$$ \\rho_{res} = 0 $$\n\nBoth mathematical approaches confirm the physical reasoning. The parabolic form of the function $f(x)=x(1-x)$ correctly ensures that for a pure component (either $x=0$ or $x=1$), the residual resistivity due to alloying is zero. The value of the constant $A$ is irrelevant because the concentration term is zero.\n\nThe predicted residual resistivity is 0 $\\Omega \\cdot m$.
