To model its behavior near the transition temperature, the scientist proposes a Landau-Devonshire theory where the Gibbs free energy density, $g$, of the material is expressed as a polynomial expansion in the electric polarization, $P$. For a uniaxial ferroelectric, the simplified form of this free energy density as a function of temperature, $T$, and polarization, $P$, is given by:\n\n$$g(T,P) = g_0(T) + \\frac{1}{2}A(T-T_C)P^2 + \\frac{1}{4}BP^4$$\n\nHere, $g_0(T)$ is a term that depends only on temperature, $T_C$ is the Curie temperature, and $A$ and $B$ are positive phenomenological constants that are independent of temperature and polarization.
