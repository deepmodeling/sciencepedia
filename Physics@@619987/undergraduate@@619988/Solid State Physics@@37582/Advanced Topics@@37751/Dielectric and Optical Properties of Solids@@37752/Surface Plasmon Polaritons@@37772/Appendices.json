For a planar interface between two semi-infinite, non-magnetic materials with relative permittivities $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$, the wavevector of the SPP, $k_{SPP}$, is given by:\n\n$$k_{SPP} = k_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2}}$$\n\nwhere $k_0$ is the free-space wavevector. For a wave to propagate along the interface, $k_{SPP}$ must have a real component. For an ideal (lossless) propagating mode to exist, $k_{SPP}$ must be purely real and positive, which means the term under the square root must be real and positive. The physical conditions for the existence of an SPP mode are derived by considering the real parts of the permittivities, which we denote as $\\epsilon_1'$ and $\\epsilon_2'$. The imaginary parts, $\\epsilon_1''$ and $\\epsilon_2''$, are related to material losses and determine the propagation length of the SPP, but they do not determine its existence.\n\nThe conditions for a propagating SPP mode are:\n\n1.  The real parts of the permittivities of the two materials must have opposite signs. One must be a metal-like material ($\\epsilon' < 0$) and the other a dielectric-like material ($\\epsilon' > 0$). This ensures that the product $\\epsilon_1' \\epsilon_2'$ is negative.\n2.  For the entire fraction $\\frac{\\epsilon_1' \\epsilon_2'}{\\epsilon_1' + \\epsilon_2'}$ to be positive, the denominator must also be negative, since the numerator is negative. This leads to the second condition: $\\epsilon_1' + \\epsilon_2' < 0$. If we label the metal-like material as medium 1 ($\\epsilon_1' < 0$) and the dielectric-like material as medium 2 ($\\epsilon_2' > 0$), this condition can be rewritten as $-\\epsilon_1' > \\epsilon_2'$, or more simply $|\\epsilon_1'| > \\epsilon_2'$.\n\nIn summary, for an interface to support an SPP, two conditions on the real parts of the permittivities must be met:\n1.  $\\epsilon_1' \\cdot \\epsilon_2' < 0$ (one is positive, one is negative)\n2.  $|\\epsilon_{\\text{metal}}'| > \\epsilon_{\\text{dielectric}}'$\n\nLet's examine each option based on the real parts of the given permittivities:\n$\\epsilon_A' = -10.0$ (metal-like)\n$\\epsilon_B' = 2.25$ (dielectric-like)\n$\\epsilon_C' = 12.0$ (dielectric-like)\n$\\epsilon_D' = -5.0$ (metal-like)\n$\\epsilon_E' = 4.0$ (dielectric-like)\n\n**A.
