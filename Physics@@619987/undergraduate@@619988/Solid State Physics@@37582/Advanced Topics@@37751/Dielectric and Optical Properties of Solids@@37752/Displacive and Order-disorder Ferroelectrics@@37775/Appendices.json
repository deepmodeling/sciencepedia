When subjected to a cyclic external electric field, $E$, the induced polarization, $P$, of the material traces a characteristic hysteresis loop on a Polarization versus Electric Field (P-E) plot.\n\nConsider a sample of such a material, initially unpolarized and unstressed, at a temperature below its Curie point. The state of the material is represented by a point on the P-E plane. Initially, this point is at the origin, $(E, P) = (0, 0)$. The following sequence of changes is applied:\n\n1.  The electric field is increased from $0$ to a large positive saturation value, $E_{max}$.\n2.  The field is then reduced from $E_{max}$ back to $0$. The state of the material is now at **Point M**, which has coordinates $(0, P_M)$.\n3.  The field is then made negative, increasing in magnitude from $0$. It reaches a value where the polarization of the material becomes zero. The state of the material at this instant is **Point N**, with coordinates $(E_N, 0)$.\n4.  The field continues to a large negative saturation value, $-E_{max}$.\n5.  The field is then increased from $-E_{max}$ back to $0$. The state of the material is now at **Point Q**, with coordinates $(0, P_Q)$.\n6.  The field is then made positive again, increasing in magnitude from $0$. It reaches a value where the polarization of the material becomes zero. The state of the material at this instant is **Point R**, with coordinates $(E_R, 0)$.\n\nThe key parameters of the hysteresis loop are the remnant polarization, $P_r$, defined as the polarization at zero electric field after saturation, and the coercive field, $E_c$, defined as the magnitude of the electric field required to bring the polarization to zero after saturation.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly relate the coordinates of the specified points to the physical parameters $P_r$ and $E_c$?

We will analyze the definition of each parameter and relate it to the points described.\n\nFirst, let's establish the definitions based on the problem description:\n- **Remnant Polarization ($P_r$)**: The polarization of the material when the external electric field is zero ($E=0$) after it has been saturated. This value is inherently positive by convention.\n- **Coercive Field ($E_c$)**: The magnitude of the electric field required to reduce the polarization to zero ($P=0$) after it has been saturated. As a magnitude, $E_c$ is always a non-negative value.\n\nNow, let's analyze the coordinates of the given points based on these definitions and the path described:\n\n- **Point M**: The state of the material after the field is increased to saturation and then reduced to zero. The coordinates are $(0, P_M)$. Since the electric field is zero, the polarization $P_M$ is, by definition, the remnant polarization. Therefore, $P_r = P_M$. As the initial saturation was in the positive direction, $P_M$ is positive.\n\n- **Point Q**: The state of the material after the field is reversed to negative saturation and then brought back to zero. The coordinates are $(0, P_Q)$. This represents the remnant polarization in the opposite direction. By the symmetry of a typical hysteresis loop, the polarization at this point is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to the positive remnant polarization. Thus, $P_Q = -P_r$.\n\n- **Point N**: The state of the material when the polarization becomes zero as the field is swept from positive to negative. The coordinates are $(E_N, 0)$. The field value $E_N$ is the electric field required to coerce the polarization to zero. Since the field is being applied in the negative direction to cancel a positive remnant polarization, $E_N$ must be a negative value. The coercive field $E_c$ is the magnitude of this field. Therefore, $E_c = |E_N| = -E_N$, or equivalently, $E_N = -E_c$.\n\n- **Point R**: The state of the material when the polarization becomes zero as the field is swept from negative to positive. The coordinates are $(E_R, 0)$. The field value $E_R$ is the electric field required to coerce the polarization to zero from its negative remnant state. This field is applied in the positive direction, so $E_R$ is a positive value. By definition and symmetry, its magnitude is the coercive field. Therefore, $E_c = E_R$.\n\nWith these relations ($P_r = P_M$, $P_Q = -P_r$, $E_c = E_R$, $E_N = -E_c$), we can evaluate each of the given statements:\n\n**A. $P_r = P_M$ and $E_c = E_N$**\n- The first part, $P_r = P_M$, is correct.\n- The second part, $E_c = E_N$, is incorrect because $E_c$ is a positive magnitude while $E_N$ is the negative field value, i.e., $E_N = -E_c$.\n- Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\n**B. $P_r = P_Q$ and $E_c = E_R$**\n- The first part, $P_r = P_Q$, is incorrect because $P_Q = -P_r$.\n- The second part, $E_c = E_R$, is correct.\n- Since one part is incorrect, statement B is incorrect.\n\n**C. $P_r = P_M$ and $E_c = E_R$**\n- The first part, $P_r = P_M$, is correct.\n- The second part, $E_c = E_R$, is also correct.\n- Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\n**D. $P_r = -P_M$ and $E_c = -E_N$**\n- The first part, $P_r = -P_M$, is incorrect because $P_r = P_M$.\n- The second part, $E_c = -E_N$, is correct because $E_N = -E_c$.\n- Since one part is incorrect, statement D is incorrect.\n\n**E. $P_r = \\frac{1}{2}(P_M - P_Q)$ and $E_c = \\frac{1}{2}(E_R - E_N)$**\n- Let's analyze the first part: $\\frac{1}{2}(P_M - P_Q)$. Substitute $P_M = P_r$ and $P_Q = -P_r$. This gives $\\frac{1}{2}(P_r - (-P_r)) = \\frac{1}{2}(2P_r) = P_r$. So, $P_r = \\frac{1}{2}(P_M - P_Q)$ is correct. This expression represents half the total height of the loop along the P-axis.\n- Let's analyze the second part: $\\frac{1}{2}(E_R - E_N)$. Substitute $E_R = E_c$ and $E_N = -E_c$. This gives $\\frac{1}{2}(E_c - (-E_c)) = \\frac{1}{2}(2E_c) = E_c$. So, $E_c = \\frac{1}{2}(E_R - E_N)$ is correct. This expression represents half the total width of the loop along the E-axis.\n- Since both parts of the statement are correct, statement E is correct.\n\nIn conclusion, statements C and E are the correct descriptions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CE}$$", "id": "1772078"}, {"introduction": "To understand why ferroelectricity arises below a specific Curie temperature, $T_C$, we turn to the powerful framework of Landau theory.
