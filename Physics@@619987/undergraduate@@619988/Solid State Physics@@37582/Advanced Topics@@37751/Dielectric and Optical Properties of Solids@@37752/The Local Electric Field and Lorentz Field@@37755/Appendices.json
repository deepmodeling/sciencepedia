This conceptual problem [@problem_id:1818334] challenges you to think critically about the underlying assumptions of the static Lorentz field. By considering the effects of isotopic substitution, you will need to distinguish between phenomena governed by electrostatics and crystal geometry, and those dependent on atomic mass and lattice dynamics. This exercise is crucial for refining your intuition about what determines a material's dielectric and vibrational properties.", "problem": "An isotropic dielectric solid is composed of a single element and forms a perfect simple cubic crystal lattice. This material is placed in a uniform, static external electric field. Now, consider a modification to this crystal: a fraction $f$ of the original atoms, which have an atomic mass $M_1$, are randomly substituted with one of their heavier, stable isotopes, which have an atomic mass $M_2$, where $M_2 > M_1$. Assume that this substitution does not alter the simple cubic lattice structure, the lattice constant $a$, the total number of atoms per unit volume $N$, or the fundamental electronic polarizability $\\alpha_e$ of an individual atom.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the physical consequences of this isotopic substitution?\n\nA. The Lorentz field, which contributes to the static local field, will increase due to the increased average atomic mass.\n\nB. The frequency of the transverse optical (TO) phonons at the zone center will remain unchanged, but the static electronic polarizability will decrease.\n\nC. The static Lorentz field will remain unchanged, but the characteristic lattice absorption frequency, known as the Reststrahlen frequency, will decrease.\n\nD. Both the static Lorentz field and the Reststrahlen frequency will remain unchanged because isotopes have identical electronic structures.\n\nE. The crystal's macroscopic static dielectric constant will decrease because the heavier isotopes are less easily polarized by the field.", "solution": "We analyze three distinct pieces of physics: the static local (Lorentz) field, the electronic polarizability, and the lattice vibrational (phonon) frequencies that determine the Reststrahlen band.\n\n1) Static local (Lorentz) field. In an isotropic cubic dielectric, the Lorentz local field at an atomic site is given by\n$$\nE_{\\text{loc}}=E+\\frac{P}{3\\epsilon_{0}},\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the macroscopic external field and $P$ is the macroscopic polarization. This result follows from electrostatics (Lorentz cavity construction) and depends on geometry and macroscopic polarization, not on atomic masses. Therefore changing atomic masses by isotopic substitution does not alter the static Lorentz field. Hence statement A is false.\n\n2) Electronic polarizability and static dielectric response. The induced dipole of an atom in the static limit is\n$$\np=\\alpha_{e}E_{\\text{loc}},\n$$\nwith $\\alpha_{e}$ the electronic polarizability. The problem explicitly states that isotopic substitution does not change $\\alpha_{e}$, and also holds fixed the number density $N$. Consequently the purely electronic contribution to the dielectric function (often denoted $\\epsilon(\\infty)$) remains unchanged. Thus any statement asserting that the static electronic polarizability decreases is false, so statement B is false on that clause alone. Regarding the macroscopic static dielectric constant, if the crystal has only electronic polarization then $\\epsilon(0)=\\epsilon(\\infty)$, which is unchanged. If the crystal also has an ionic (lattice) contribution, then using the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation for a single polar mode,\n$$\n\\frac{\\epsilon(0)}{\\epsilon(\\infty)}=\\frac{\\omega_{L}^{2}}{\\omega_{T}^{2}},\n$$\nand both $\\omega_{L}$ and $\\omega_{T}$ scale as $M^{-1/2}$ for a given force constant, so their ratio is mass independent. Hence $\\epsilon(0)$ also remains unchanged when $\\epsilon(\\infty)$ is unchanged. Therefore statement E is false.\n\n3) Lattice vibrational frequencies and Reststrahlen band. The characteristic lattice absorption (Reststrahlen) frequency in a polar dielectric coincides with the transverse optical phonon frequency at the Brillouin-zone center. For a harmonic mode with effective force constant $K$ and effective mass $M$, the frequency is\n$$\n\\omega=\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{M}}.\n$$\nReplacing a fraction $f$ of atoms of mass $M_{1}$ with heavier isotopes of mass $M_{2}>M_{1}$ increases the effective mass that enters the long-wavelength optical mode. In a mean-mass approximation, one may write an effective mass\n$$\n\\overline{M}=(1-f)M_{1}+fM_{2},\n$$\nso that the TO frequency scales as\n$$\n\\omega_{T}\\propto\\overline{M}^{-1/2}.\n$$\nThus increasing $\\overline{M}$ decreases $\\omega_{T}$, shifting the Reststrahlen frequency downward. Therefore the statement that the Reststrahlen frequency decreases is correct. Because the Lorentz field is unchanged (as shown in 1), statement C is correct, while statement D is false since the Reststrahlen frequency does not remain unchanged.\n\nConclusion from the above:\n- A: false (Lorentz field is independent of mass).\n- B: false (TO frequency decreases; $\\alpha_{e}$ unchanged).\n- C: true (Lorentz field unchanged; Reststrahlen frequency decreases).\n- D: false (phonon frequency changes).\n- E: false (static dielectric constant does not decrease under the given assumptions).\n\nNote: In monatomic Bravais lattices there is no infrared-active optical phonon; in such a case there would be no Reststrahlen band and only the electronic contribution persists, which is still mass independent. The key conclusion regarding mass lowering lattice vibrational frequencies in systems where such modes exist remains valid and selects C as the correct option.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1818334"}]}
