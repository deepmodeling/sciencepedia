{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our exploration of how materials respond to electric fields, we start with the most fundamental mechanism: electronic polarizability. This phenomenon occurs in all atoms, as an external field can distort the atom's electron cloud relative to its nucleus. This practice employs a simple yet powerful classical model, treating the electron as a mass on a spring, to connect the microscopic restoring force within an atom to the macroscopic, measurable quantity of electronic polarizability, $\\alpha_e$ [@problem_id:1773922]. By working through this problem, you will develop a tangible intuition for how an atom's internal structure dictates its electrical response.", "problem": "A simple classical model to understand the electronic polarizability of an atom treats it as a stationary, heavy nucleus and a single outer electron of charge $-e$ bound to it. When an external uniform electric field with magnitude $E$ is applied, the electron is displaced by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium position relative to the nucleus. This displacement creates an induced electric dipole moment with magnitude $p$. It is assumed that the restoring force that pulls the electron back towards the nucleus obeys Hooke's Law, $F_{restore} = -kx$, where $k$ is an effective restoring force constant. The electronic polarizability, $\\alpha_e$, is defined by the relationship $p = \\alpha_e E$.\n\nFor a single atom of argon, the experimentally measured electronic polarizability is $\\alpha_e = 1.83 \\times 10^{-40} \\text{ C} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{V}$. The elementary charge is $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}$. Using the classical model described, calculate the value of the effective restoring force constant $k$ for the outer electron in an argon atom.\n\nExpress your final answer in N/m, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the effective restoring force constant $k$ for an electron in an argon atom, based on a classical model.\n\nFirst, let's establish the forces acting on the electron when the external electric field $E$ is applied. The electric field exerts a force on the electron, which has a charge of $-e$. The magnitude of this electric force is:\n$$F_{elec} = |-e| E = eE$$\n\nThis electric force causes the electron to be displaced from its equilibrium position. According to the model, this displacement is opposed by a Hooke's Law restoring force with magnitude:\n$$F_{restore} = kx$$\nwhere $x$ is the magnitude of the displacement.\n\nThe electron will settle at a new equilibrium position where the electric force is perfectly balanced by the restoring force. Therefore, we can set the magnitudes of the two forces equal to each other:\n$$eE = kx$$\n\nFrom this equilibrium condition, we can solve for the displacement $x$:\n$$x = \\frac{eE}{k}$$\n\nThe displacement of the electron of charge $-e$ relative to the stationary nucleus creates an induced electric dipole. The magnitude of this induced dipole moment, $p$, is the product of the magnitude of the charge and the separation distance:\n$$p = ex$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the displacement $x$ into the equation for the dipole moment $p$:\n$$p = e \\left(\\frac{eE}{k}\\right) = \\frac{e^2}{k} E$$\n\nThe problem statement provides the definition of electronic polarizability, $\\alpha_e$, as $p = \\alpha_e E$. By comparing our derived expression for $p$ with this definition, we can establish a relationship between $\\alpha_e$, $e$, and $k$:\n$$\\frac{e^2}{k} E = \\alpha_e E$$\nBy canceling the electric field $E$ from both sides, we get:\n$$\\alpha_e = \\frac{e^2}{k}$$\n\nOur goal is to find the restoring force constant $k$. We can rearrange the above equation to solve for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{e^2}{\\alpha_e}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

The unit is $\\frac{\\text{C}^2 \\cdot \\text{V}}{\\text{C} \\cdot \\text{m}^2} = \\frac{\\text{C} \\cdot \\text{V}}{\\text{m}^2}$.
