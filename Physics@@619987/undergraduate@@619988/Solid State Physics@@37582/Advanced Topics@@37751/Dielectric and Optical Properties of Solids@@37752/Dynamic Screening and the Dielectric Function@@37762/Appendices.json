By analyzing how screening effectiveness responds to changes in carrier density in both scenarios, you will uncover the profound and distinct impact of the electronic density of states in systems of different dimensions [@problem_id:1772813].", "problem": "In the study of condensed matter systems, the response of an electron gas to a static point charge impurity is described by the theory of screening. The Thomas-Fermi (TF) model provides a simple yet powerful description of this phenomenon for a non-interacting, zero-temperature electron gas. It introduces a characteristic wavevector, $k_{TF}$, which quantifies the screening effectiveness. The definitions of this wavevector differ between systems of different dimensionalities.\n\nFor a three-dimensional electron gas (3DEG) in a uniform medium of permittivity $\\epsilon$, the square of the TF wavevector is given by:\n$$k_{TF,3D}^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon} g_{3D}(E_F)$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge and $g_{3D}(E_F)$ is the density of states per unit volume at the Fermi energy $E_F$.\n\nFor a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG), the TF wavevector is given by:\n$$k_{TF,2D} = \\frac{e^2}{2\\epsilon} g_{2D}(E_F)$$\nwhere $g_{2D}(E_F)$ is the density of states per unit area at the Fermi energy.\n\nThe density of states $g(E)$ and the Fermi energy $E_F$ depend on the dimensionality and the electron number density ($n_{3D}$ for 3D, $n_{2D}$ for 2D) as follows:\n- For a 3DEG: The density of states varies with energy as $g_{3D}(E) \\propto E^{1/2}$, and the Fermi energy is related to the density by $E_{F,3D} \\propto n_{3D}^{2/3}$.\n- For a 2DEG: The density of states $g_{2D}(E)$ is constant for energy $E > 0$, and the Fermi energy is related to the density by $E_{F,2D} \\propto n_{2D}$.\n\nNow, consider a scenario where an external gate voltage is used to modify the carrier concentration.

We will analyze the 2D and 3D cases separately and then combine the results.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG).\nThe TF wavevector for the 2DEG is given by $k_{TF,2D} = \\frac{e^2}{2\\epsilon} g_{2D}(E_F)$. The effectiveness of screening, as parameterized by $k_{TF,2D}$, is directly proportional to the density of states at the Fermi level, $g_{2D}(E_F)$.\nThe problem states that for a 2DEG, the density of states $g_{2D}(E)$ is constant for all energies $E > 0$. This is a hallmark of a 2DEG.\nThis means that $g_{2D}(E_F)$ does not depend on the value of the Fermi energy $E_F$. Since $E_{F,2D}$ changes with the electron density $n_{2D}$, the fact that $g_{2D}(E_F)$ is constant implies that it is also independent of the electron density $n_{2D}$.\nTherefore, when the electron density is changed from $n_{2D,i}$ to $n_{2D,f} = \\alpha n_{2D,i}$, the value of $g_{2D}(E_F)$ remains unchanged.\nConsequently, the TF wavevector $k_{TF,2D}$ also remains unchanged.\nSo, $k_{TF,2D,f} = k_{TF,2D,i}$.\nThe ratio for the 2D case is $R_{2D} = \\frac{k_{TF,2D,f}}{k_{TF,2D,i}} = 1$.\n\nNext, let's analyze the three-dimensional electron gas (3DEG).\nThe square of the TF wavevector for the 3DEG is given by $k_{TF,3D}^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon} g_{3D}(E_F)$. This shows that $k_{TF,3D}^2$ is directly proportional to the density of states at the Fermi level, $g_{3D}(E_F)$.\nSo, we can write $k_{TF,3D}^2 \\propto g_{3D}(E_F)$.\nThe problem provides the energy dependence of the 3D density of states: $g_{3D}(E) \\propto E^{1/2}$.\nAt the Fermi energy, this means $g_{3D}(E_F) \\propto E_{F,3D}^{1/2}$.\nSubstituting this into our proportionality for $k_{TF,3D}^2$, we get $k_{TF,3D}^2 \\propto E_{F,3D}^{1/2}$.\nThe problem also gives the relationship between the 3D Fermi energy and the 3D electron density: $E_{F,3D} \\propto n_{3D}^{2/3}$.\nNow we can combine these proportionalities to find how $k_{TF,3D}$ depends on the electron density $n_{3D}$:\n$$k_{TF,3D}^2 \\propto E_{F,3D}^{1/2} \\propto (n_{3D}^{2/3})^{1/2} = n_{3D}^{1/3}$$\nThis gives us the relationship $k_{TF,3D}^2 \\propto n_{3D}^{1/3}$.\nNow we can form the ratio of the final to the initial squared wavevector:\n$$\\frac{k_{TF,3D,f}^2}{k_{TF,3D,i}^2} = \\frac{(n_{3D,f})^{1/3}}{(n_{3D,i})^{1/3}} = \\left(\\frac{n_{3D,f}}{n_{3D,i}}\\right)^{1/3}$$\nWe are given that $n_{3D,f} = \\alpha n_{3D,i}$. Substituting this in, we get:\n$$\\frac{k_{TF,3D,f}^2}{k_{TF,3D,i}^2} = \\alpha^{1/3}$$\nTo find the ratio $R_{3D} = \\frac{k_{TF,3D,f}}{k_{TF,3D,i}}$, we take the square root of both sides:\n$$R_{3D} = \\sqrt{\\alpha^{1/3}} = \\alpha^{(1/3) \\times (1/2)} = \\alpha^{1/6}$$\n\nFinally, we need to compute the combined ratio $\\frac{R_{3D}}{R_{2D}}$.\nUsing the results from our separate analyses:\n$$R_{3D} = \\alpha^{1/6}$$\n$$R_{2D} = 1$$\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n$$\\frac{R_{3D}}{R_{2D}} = \\frac{\\alpha^{1/6}}{1} = \\alpha^{1/6}$$\nThis result highlights a fundamental difference between screening in 2D and 3D systems within the Thomas-Fermi model. In 3D, increasing the electron density enhances screening, whereas in 2D, the screening parameter $k_{TF,2D}$ is independent of density.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\alpha^{1/6}}$$", "id": "1772813"}]}
