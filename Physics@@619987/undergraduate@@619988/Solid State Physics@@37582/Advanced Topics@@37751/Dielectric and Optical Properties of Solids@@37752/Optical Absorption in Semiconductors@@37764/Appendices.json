The material has a band gap energy of $E_g = 1.80 \\text{ eV}$. The effective mass of a conduction band electron is determined to be $m_e^* = 0.12 m_0$, and the effective mass of a valence band hole is $m_h^* = 0.58 m_0$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass of a free electron. During an experiment, a photon with an energy of $E_{ph} = 3.00 \\text{ eV}$ is absorbed by the semiconductor. This absorption excites an electron from the top of the valence band to the conduction band, creating an electron-hole pair. Assume the crystal momentum of the absorbed photon is negligible.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the kinetic energy imparted to the electron to the kinetic energy imparted to the hole, $KE_e / KE_h$. Report your answer as a numerical value rounded to three significant figures.\n\n", "solution": "The process of photon absorption must conserve both energy and momentum.\n\nFirst, let's consider the conservation of energy. The energy of the incoming photon, $E_{ph}$, is used to create the electron-hole pair and to provide kinetic energy to both the electron ($KE_e$) and the hole ($KE_h$). The minimum energy required to create the electron-hole pair is equal to the band gap energy, $E_g$. The excess energy is converted into kinetic energy. Therefore, the energy conservation equation is:\n$$E_{ph} = E_g + KE_e + KE_h$$\nThe total kinetic energy given to the pair is $\\Delta E = KE_e + KE_h = E_{ph} - E_g$.\n\nNext, let's consider the conservation of momentum. The problem states that the initial momentum of the system (the photon) can be considered negligible. Thus, the initial momentum is approximately zero. After the photon is absorbed, an electron with momentum $\\vec{p}_e$ and a hole with momentum $\\vec{p}_h$ are created. To conserve momentum, the final total momentum must also be zero:\n$$\\vec{p}_e + \\vec{p}_h = 0$$\nThis implies that the momenta of the electron and the hole are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n$$\\vec{p}_e = -\\vec{p}_h$$\nLet the magnitude of their momenta be $p = |\\vec{p}_e| = |\\vec{p}_h|$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of a particle can be expressed in terms of its momentum $p$ and mass $m$ as $KE = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$. In a semiconductor crystal, we use the effective masses, $m_e^*$ and $m_h^*$, for the electron and hole, respectively.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the electron is:\n$$KE_e = \\frac{p^2}{2m_e^*}$$\nThe kinetic energy of the hole is:\n$$KE_h = \\frac{p^2}{2m_h^*}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $KE_e / KE_h$. We can now form this ratio using the expressions above:\n$$\\frac{KE_e}{KE_h} = \\frac{\\frac{p^2}{2m_e^*}}{\\frac{p^2}{2m_h^*}}$$\nThe terms $p^2$ and $2$ cancel out, leaving a simple relationship between the kinetic energies and the effective masses:\n$$\\frac{KE_e}{KE_h} = \\frac{m_h^*}{m_e^*}$$\nThis result indicates that the lighter particle (the one with smaller effective mass) receives a larger share of the kinetic energy. Note that the photon energy $E_{ph}$ and the band gap energy $E_g$ are not required to calculate this specific ratio, as long as $E_{ph} > E_g$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values for the effective masses:\n$m_e^* = 0.12 m_0$\n$m_h^* = 0.58 m_0$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{KE_e}{KE_h} = \\frac{0.58 m_0}{0.12 m_0} = \\frac{0.58}{0.12}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\frac{0.58}{0.12} \\approx 4.83333...$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$4.83333... \\approx 4.83$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.83}$$"}, {"introduction": "Not all semiconductors absorb light in the same way; the crystal's band structure is key.
