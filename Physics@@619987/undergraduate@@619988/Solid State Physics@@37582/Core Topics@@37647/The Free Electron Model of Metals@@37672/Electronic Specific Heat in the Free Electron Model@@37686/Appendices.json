At low temperatures, the electronic heat capacity per electron, $c_v$, is found to follow a power-law relationship with the absolute temperature $T$ and the electron number density $n$ (number of electrons per unit $d$-dimensional volume). This relationship can be expressed as $c_v \\propto T^{\\alpha} n^{\\beta}$.

Including a factor of 2 for spin degeneracy, this is:\n$$ N(k) = 2 \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^d} (\\text{Volume of a unit } d\\text{-sphere}) \\times k^d $$\nThe volume of a unit $d$-sphere is $\\frac{\\pi^{d/2}}{\\Gamma(d/2 + 1)}$.

We can express $k$ in terms of energy $E$:\n$$ k(E) = \\left(\\frac{E}{A}\\right)^{1/s} $$\nNow we find the number of states with energy less than or equal to $E$, denoted by $N(E)$, by substituting $k(E)$ into the expression for $N(k)$:\n$$ N(E) = C_k V \\left[ \\left(\\frac{E}{A}\\right)^{1/s} \\right]^d = C_k V A^{-d/s} E^{d/s} $$\nThe density of states (DOS), $g(E)$, is the number of states per unit energy interval, defined as $g(E) = \\frac{dN(E)}{dE}$.\n$$ g(E) = \\frac{d}{dE} \\left( C_k V A^{-d/s} E^{d/s} \\right) = C_k V A^{-d/s} \\left(\\frac{d}{s}\\right) E^{d/s - 1} $$\nLet $C_E = C_k A^{-d/s} (d/s)$ be a new constant.

From Step 1, $g(E_F) \\propto V E_F^{d/s - 1}$.\n$$ C_V \\propto V E_F^{d/s - 1} T $$\nFrom Step 2, we know $E_F \\propto n^{s/d}$.
