This exercise provides a dramatic and quantitative illustration of this principle's importance. By directly comparing the ground-state energy of an electron gas under hypothetical classical rules versus the correct quantum mechanical rules, you will see why treating electrons as a Fermi gas is not just a minor correction, but an absolute necessity for understanding the properties of metals [@problem_id:1761540].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a one-dimensional metallic nanowire of length $L$. The wire contains $N$ atoms, and each atom contributes exactly one mobile valence electron to the system, resulting in a total of $N$ electrons. We model the confinement of these electrons within the wire as a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length $L$. The quantized single-particle energy levels for an electron in this well are given by the formula:\n$$E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}$$\nwhere $n$ is a positive integer ($n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$), $h$ is Planck's constant, and $m$ is the mass of the electron.

In this scenario, all $N$ electrons can occupy the lowest possible single-particle energy state to achieve the minimum total energy for the system. Let the total ground-state energy for this scenario be $E_{cl}$.\n\n**Scenario B (Quantum Reality):** The electrons are treated correctly as identical fermions, which must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle dictates that no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Since electrons have spin, each energy level $E_n$ can accommodate at most two electrons, one with spin up and one with spin down. To achieve the ground state, the electrons fill the available energy levels from the lowest energy upwards. Let the total ground-state energy for this scenario be $E_{qm}$.\n\nIn the limit of very large $N$, the ratio of these two total energies, $\\frac{E_{qm}}{E_{cl}}$, can be approximated by the form $C N^k$ for some constant $C$ and power $k$. It turns out that for this system, the power is $k=2$. Your task is to find the dimensionless constant of proportionality, $C$.
