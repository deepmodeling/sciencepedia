The charge carriers, each with charge $q$, move along the length of the strip. The external magnetic field, $B$, is perpendicular to their velocity.\n\nThe magnetic field exerts a Lorentz force on each charge carrier. The magnitude of this force is given by $F_B = |q| v_d B$, since the velocity is perpendicular to the magnetic field. This force is directed across the width of the strip.\n\nThis magnetic force causes the charge carriers to be deflected to one side of the strip, leading to an accumulation of charge on that side and a deficiency of charge (or an accumulation of opposite charge) on the other. This separation of charge creates a transverse electric field, $E_T$, across the width of the strip.\n\nThe transverse electric field, in turn, exerts an electric force on the charge carriers, with a magnitude of $F_E = |q| E_T$. This electric force is directed opposite to the magnetic force.\n\nA steady state is reached when the transverse flow of charge ceases. This occurs when the electric force perfectly balances the magnetic force. The equilibrium condition is therefore:\n$$F_E = F_B$$\n$$|q| E_T = |q| v_d B$$\n\nThe charge $|q|$ cancels out, leaving a relationship between the electric field, drift velocity, and magnetic field:\n$$E_T = v_d B$$\n\nThe transverse electric field $E_T$ is related to the measured transverse voltage $V_T$ across the strip of width $w$. Assuming the electric field is uniform across the width, this relationship is:\n$$V_T = E_T w$$\n\nWe can express the electric field as $E_T = \\frac{V_T}{w}$.
