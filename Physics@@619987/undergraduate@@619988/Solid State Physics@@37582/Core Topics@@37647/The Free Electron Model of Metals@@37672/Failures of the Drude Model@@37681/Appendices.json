This phenomenon, which measures the transverse voltage in a conductor in a magnetic field, provides direct insight into the sign and density of charge carriers. This practice explores the puzzling case of potassium, where the Hall coefficient $R_H$ is experimentally positive, contradicting the Drude prediction for negative electrons. You will investigate how a more advanced two-carrier model, incorporating the quantum mechanical concept of 'holes,' can explain this anomaly [@problem_id:1776430].", "problem": "The Drude model offers a classical picture of electron transport in metals. A key prediction of this model is the Hall coefficient, $R_H = -1/(ne)$, where $n$ is the density of conduction electrons and $-e$ is the elementary charge of an electron. While this prediction is successful for some alkali metals, it fails in intriguing ways for others, highlighting the necessity of a quantum mechanical approach based on band theory.\n\nConsider the case of potassium (K), a monovalent metal with a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal structure. The simple Drude model, assuming one free electron per atom, predicts a negative Hall coefficient. However, experimental measurements performed at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields surprisingly reveal that the Hall coefficient for potassium is positive.\n\nThis paradoxical positive sign can be explained within a more sophisticated framework by a two-carrier model. In this model, the conduction is attributed to two types of charge carriers simultaneously: a group of \"electron-like\" carriers with charge $-e$, effective density $n_e$, and mobility $\\mu_e$, and a group of \"hole-like\" carriers with charge $+e$, effective density $n_h$, and mobility $\\mu_h$. For a system with two such carrier types, the Hall coefficient is given by the expression:\n$$R_H = \\frac{n_h \\mu_h^2 - n_e \\mu_e^2}{e(n_h \\mu_h + n_e \\mu_e)^2}$$\nFor a particular sample of potassium under these experimental conditions, a simplified analysis based on its electronic band structure suggests that the effective densities of the two carrier types are related by the equation $n_e = 2.25 n_h$.\n\nTo account for the experimentally observed positive Hall coefficient, what is the minimum value that the mobility ratio $\\mu_h / \\mu_e$ must exceed? Provide your answer as a real number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum value of the mobility ratio $\\mu_h / \\mu_e$ that would result in a positive Hall coefficient $R_H$ for potassium, based on a two-carrier model.\n\nThe expression for the Hall coefficient in the two-carrier model is given as:\n$$R_H = \\frac{n_h \\mu_h^2 - n_e \\mu_e^2}{e(n_h \\mu_h + n_e \\mu_e)^2}$$\n\nFor the Hall coefficient $R_H$ to be positive, the numerator of this expression must be positive, as the denominator is always positive. The elementary charge $e$, the carrier densities $n_e$ and $n_h$, and the mobilities $\\mu_e$ and $\\mu_h$ are all defined as positive quantities. Thus, the term $(n_h \\mu_h + n_e \\mu_e)^2$ is always positive.\n\nWe must therefore satisfy the condition:\n$$n_h \\mu_h^2 - n_e \\mu_e^2 > 0$$\n\nWe can rearrange this inequality to analyze the relationship between the mobilities and densities.\n$$n_h \\mu_h^2 > n_e \\mu_e^2$$\n\nTo find the ratio of mobilities, we can divide both sides by $n_h \\mu_e^2$ (which is a positive quantity):\n$$\\frac{\\mu_h^2}{\\mu_e^2} > \\frac{n_e}{n_h}$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the condition for the mobility ratio. Since mobilities are positive, we do not need to worry about the direction of the inequality changing.\n$$\\frac{\\mu_h}{\\mu_e} > \\sqrt{\\frac{n_e}{n_h}}$$\n\nThis inequality tells us that for the Hall coefficient to be positive, the ratio of the hole mobility to the electron mobility must be greater than the square root of the ratio of the electron density to the hole density. The question asks for the minimum value that the ratio $\\mu_h / \\mu_e$ must exceed. This value is the boundary of the inequality, which is $\\sqrt{n_e / n_h}$.\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between the effective carrier densities:\n$$n_e = 2.25 n_h$$\n\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the densities:\n$$\\frac{n_e}{n_h} = 2.25$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this value into our boundary condition expression:\n$$\\text{Minimum value to exceed} = \\sqrt{2.25}$$\n\nCalculating the square root gives:\n$$\\sqrt{2.25} = 1.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value 1.5 can be written as 1.50 to reflect this precision.\n\nThus, the ratio of hole mobility to electron mobility, $\\mu_h / \\mu_e$, must be greater than 1.50 for the Hall coefficient to be positive. This result is physically significant, as it shows that even if the number of hole-like carriers is smaller than the number of electron-like carriers (as $n_h < n_e$), a sufficiently high mobility of these holes can dominate the Hall effect and flip its sign from the negative value predicted by the simple Drude model.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.50}$$", "id": "1776430"}, {"introduction": "Beyond DC transport, the Drude model also makes predictions about the optical properties of metals, suggesting they should become transparent above a certain 'plasma frequency,' $\\omega_p$.
