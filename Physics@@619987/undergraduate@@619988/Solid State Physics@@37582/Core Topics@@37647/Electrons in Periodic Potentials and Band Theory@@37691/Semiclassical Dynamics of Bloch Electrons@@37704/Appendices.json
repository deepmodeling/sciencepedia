The key equations relate the electron's velocity and the change in its crystal momentum to the band structure $E(k)$ and the external force $F_{ext}$.\n\nFirst, the velocity of the electron is not given by $p/m$, but by its group velocity, $v_g$, which is determined by the slope of the dispersion curve:\n$$v_g = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{dE}{dk}$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe acceleration, $a$, of the electron is the time derivative of its group velocity:\n$$a = \\frac{dv_g}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{dE}{dk} \\right)$$\nUsing the chain rule, since $k$ is a function of time when an external force is applied, we have:\n$$a = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} \\frac{dk}{dt}$$\nThe second semiclassical equation relates the rate of change of the crystal momentum $k$ to the external force $F_{ext}$:\n$$\\hbar \\frac{dk}{dt} = F_{ext}$$\nFor an electron with charge $-e$ in a uniform electric field $\\mathcal{E}$, the external force is $F_{ext} = -e\\mathcal{E}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the acceleration equation, we get:\n$$a = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} \\left( \\frac{F_{ext}}{\\hbar} \\right) = \\frac{F_{ext}}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}$$\nThis equation shows that the electron's acceleration is directly proportional to the curvature of the $E(k)$ band, $\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}$.\n\nThe problem states that the electron is initially at a crystal momentum $k_0$ corresponding to an inflection point of the $E(k)$ curve. By mathematical definition, an inflection point is a point on a curve at which the curvature changes sign. For a twice-differentiable function like our $E(k)$, this occurs where the second derivative is zero.\nAt the inflection point $k=k_0$, we have:\n$$\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}\\bigg|_{k=k_0} = 0$$\n\nNow, we can find the initial acceleration of the electron by substituting this condition into our derived expression for acceleration:\n$$a = \\frac{F_{ext}}{\\hbar^2} \\left( \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}\\bigg|_{k=k_0} \\right) = \\frac{F_{ext}}{\\hbar^2} \\times 0 = 0$$\nThus, even though a non-zero external force is applied, the initial acceleration of the electron is zero.\n\nThis result can also be understood through the concept of effective mass, $m^*$. The effective mass is defined by analogy to Newton's second law, $F_{ext} = m^*a$. Comparing this with our derived acceleration equation, we find:\n$$m^* = \\frac{F_{ext}}{a} = \\frac{F_{ext}}{\\frac{F_{ext}}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{d^2E/dk^2}$$\nAt the inflection point, since $\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = 0$, the effective mass becomes infinite:\n$$m^* \\to \\infty$$\nAn infinite effective mass means the particle has infinite inertia, so a finite force produces zero acceleration ($a = F_{ext}/m^* \\to 0$).\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the acceleration of the electron is zero.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. The acceleration of the electron is infinite. Incorrect. This confuses the zero in the denominator of the effective mass formula.\nB. The acceleration of the electron is zero. Correct. As derived, the zero curvature leads to zero acceleration.\nC. The acceleration of the electron is $-e\\mathcal{E}/m_e$. Incorrect. This is the classical result for a free electron in a vacuum and completely ignores the influence of the crystal lattice potential encapsulated in the $E(k)$ relation.\nD. The acceleration is non-zero and has the largest possible magnitude. Incorrect. The acceleration is actually zero, its minimum possible magnitude. The velocity is at its maximum magnitude at this point, which might be a source of confusion.\nE. The electron immediately begins to decelerate. Incorrect. Deceleration is a non-zero acceleration.
