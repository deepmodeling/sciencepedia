Such materials have a filled valence band and an empty conduction band with a moderate energy gap, which yields thermally activated carriers at room temperature but not a partially filled band as in metals.\n\nIsoelectronic analogy: GaAs, with $4$ valence electrons per atom on average and a zinc blende (tetrahedral) structure, is isoelectronic with Group 14 elemental semiconductors (Si, Ge). Therefore it has the same band filling (closed-shell bonding) and a finite band gap, placing it in the semiconductor class.\n\nExcluding alternatives: A conductor requires a partially filled band or band overlap, which does not occur for a closed-shell $8$-electron pair per formula unit in a tetrahedral covalent network. An insulator would have a very large band gap and negligible intrinsic carriers at room temperature, unlike typical IIIâ€“V compounds with moderate gaps.

A key feature is the band gap, the energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. The Valence Band Maximum (VBM) is the highest energy state in the valence band, and the Conduction Band Minimum (CBM) is the lowest energy state in the conduction band. Each of these states is characterized by an energy and a crystal momentum vector, $k$.\n\nIn a \"direct\" band gap semiconductor, the VBM and CBM occur at the same crystal momentum vector. In an \"indirect\" band gap semiconductor, they occur at different crystal momentum vectors. This structural difference has profound implications for how these materials interact with light.\n\nConsider the process of optical absorption, where a single photon excites an electron from the VBM to the CBM.
