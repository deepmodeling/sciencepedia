This thought experiment challenges you to consider whether the Fermi energy depends on the overall size of a sample or on the intrinsic nature of the material itself. Correctly answering this reveals a deep understanding of what the Fermi energy truly represents in the free electron model.

The side length of Sample B is exactly twice the side length of Sample A. We analyze the properties of the conduction electrons in these samples using the free electron model, which treats them as a gas of non-interacting fermions. Let $E_{F,A}$ be the Fermi energy of Sample A and $E_{F,B}$ be the Fermi energy of Sample B, both measured at absolute zero temperature ($T=0$ K).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between the two Fermi energies and provides the correct physical reasoning?\n\nA. $E_{F,B} > E_{F,A}$, because Sample B has a greater total mass and therefore a greater total number of conduction electrons, which must fill the available quantum states up to a higher energy level.\n\nB. $E_{F,B}  E_{F,A}$, because the larger volume of Sample B means the allowed energy levels for the electrons are more closely spaced, and thus accommodating all the electrons requires filling up to a lower maximum energy.\n\nC. $E_{F,B} = E_{F,A}$, because the Fermi energy is determined by the electron number density (number of conduction electrons per unit volume), which is an intrinsic property of the metal and is independent of the sample's size.\n\nD.

When the side length doubles from Sample A to Sample B, the volume changes by a factor of $8$, and the total number of electrons also changes by the same factor of $8$, so $n=N/V$ remains unchanged. Consequently,\n$$\nE_{F,B}=E_{F,A}.\n$$\n\nThis directly contradicts option A, which incorrectly claims that a larger total number of electrons forces a higher $E_{F}$; the correct dependence is on $n$, not on $N$ alone. It also contradicts option B, which notes the closer spacing of allowed levels in a larger box but overlooks that the total number of electrons increases proportionally, leaving $k_{F}$ and hence $E_{F}$ unchanged. Option D is incorrect in this context because, within the free electron model as stated, the dependence on $n$ is sufficient and does not require knowledge of the crystal structure.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the Fermi energy is the same for both samples because it depends only on the electron number density, an intrinsic property of the metal, independent of sample size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1765764"}, {"introduction": "The existence of a high Fermi energy has profound physical consequences that set quantum electron gases apart from their classical counterparts.
