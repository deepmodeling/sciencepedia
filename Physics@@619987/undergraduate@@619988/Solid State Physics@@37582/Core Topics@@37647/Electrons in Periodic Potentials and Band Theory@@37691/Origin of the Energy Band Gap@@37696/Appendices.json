The energy of a free electron is given by $E^{(0)}(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$. At a Brillouin zone boundary located at $k = G/2$, where $G$ is a reciprocal lattice vector, the states with wavevectors $k = G/2$ and $k' = -G/2$ are degenerate, i.e., $E^{(0)}(G/2) = E^{(0)}(-G/2)$.\n\nThe periodic potential $V(x)$ can be expressed as a Fourier series:\n$$\nV(x) = \\sum_{G'} V_{G'} e^{iG'x}\n$$\nwhere $G'$ are the reciprocal lattice vectors of the potential, and the Fourier coefficients $V_{G'}$ are given by:\n$$\nV_{G'} = \\frac{1}{L_{\\text{period}}} \\int_0^{L_{\\text{period}}} V(x) e^{-iG'x} dx\n$$\nHere, the period of our potential $V(x) = U_0 \\cos(4\\pi x/a)$ is $L_{\\text{period}} = a/2$.

This boundary corresponds to the shortest non-zero reciprocal lattice vector of the crystal lattice, which is $G_1 = 2\\pi/a$. The two states that are mixed by the potential are $k = \\pi/a$ and $k' = k - G_1 = \\pi/a - 2\\pi/a = -\\pi/a$.
