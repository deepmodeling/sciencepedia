The device operates under a strong reverse bias, just below the breakdown voltage. In this regime, a single photon absorbed in the depletion region can generate an electron-hole pair, which is then accelerated by the high electric field. These accelerated carriers can gain enough kinetic energy to create new electron-hole pairs through impact ionization, leading to an avalanche of charge carriers and a measurable current pulse.\n\nIn the specific silicon p-n junction being used, the ionization coefficient for electrons, denoted as $\\alpha_n$, is known to be significantly larger than the ionization coefficient for holes, $\\alpha_p$. That is, $\\alpha_n \\gg \\alpha_p$. The ionization coefficient represents the number of electron-hole pairs generated by a carrier per unit distance traveled.
