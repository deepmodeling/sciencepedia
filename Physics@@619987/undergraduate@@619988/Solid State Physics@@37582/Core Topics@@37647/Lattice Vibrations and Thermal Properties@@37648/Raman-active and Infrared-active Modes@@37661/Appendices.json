The solution relies on understanding the selection rules for these two spectroscopic techniques.\n\nA vibrational mode is IR active if the vibration causes a change in the molecule's electric dipole moment. Mathematically, the transition dipole moment integral must be non-zero, which for a fundamental vibration simplifies to the condition that the derivative of the dipole moment with respect to the normal coordinate of vibration, $\\frac{d\\vec{\\mu}}{dq}$, is non-zero at the equilibrium position.\n\nA vibrational mode is Raman active if the vibration causes a change in the molecule's polarizability. Polarizability, $\\alpha$, describes the ease with which the electron cloud of a molecule can be distorted by an external electric field. The selection rule for Raman scattering requires that the derivative of the polarizability with respect to the normal coordinate, $\\frac{d\\alpha}{dq}$, is non-zero at the equilibrium position.\n\nLet's analyze each gas based on these principles.\n\n**Analysis of Gas 1 (Homonuclear Diatomic Molecule, e.g., $\\text{O}_2$, $\\text{N}_2$):**\nA homonuclear diatomic molecule consists of two identical atoms. Due to its perfect symmetry, the molecule has no permanent electric dipole moment ($\\vec{\\mu} = 0$). The only vibrational mode for a diatomic molecule is the stretching of the bond between the two atoms. As the bond stretches or compresses, the molecule remains symmetric, and its dipole moment remains zero throughout the vibration. Therefore, the change in dipole moment with respect to the vibrational coordinate is zero ($\\frac{d\\vec{\\mu}}{dq} = 0$). This means the fundamental vibration of a homonuclear diatomic molecule is **IR inactive**. This is consistent with the experimental observation that Gas 1 shows no IR absorption peak.\n\nNow, let's consider its Raman activity. The polarizability of the molecule is related to the volume and shape of its electron cloud. When the bond stretches, the electron cloud becomes larger and more diffuse, making it easier to distort (more polarizable). When the bond compresses, the electron cloud becomes tighter and less polarizable. Thus, the polarizability changes as the molecule vibrates. Consequently, the derivative of the polarizability with respect to the vibrational coordinate is non-zero ($\\frac{d\\alpha}{dq} \\neq 0$). This means the fundamental vibration of a homonuclear diatomic molecule is **Raman active**. This is consistent with the observation that Gas 1 shows a strong Raman signal.\n\nIn summary, for Gas 1 (homonuclear): IR inactive, Raman active.\n\n**Analysis of Gas 2 (Heteronuclear Diatomic Molecule, e.g., $\\text{CO}$, $\\text{HCl}$):**\nA heteronuclear diatomic molecule consists of two different atoms. Due to the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms, there is an uneven sharing of electrons, resulting in a permanent electric dipole moment ($\\vec{\\mu} \\neq 0$). As the bond vibrates, the distance between the two atoms changes. The magnitude of the dipole moment is a function of this distance. Therefore, the dipole moment oscillates around its equilibrium value during the vibration, and the change in dipole moment with respect to the vibrational coordinate is non-zero ($\\frac{d\\vec{\\mu}}{dq} \\neq 0$). This means the fundamental vibration of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule is **IR active**. This is consistent with the observation that Gas 2 shows a strong IR absorption peak.\n\nFor Raman activity, the reasoning is similar to the homonuclear case. As the bond in the heteronuclear molecule vibrates, its length changes. This change in bond length leads to a change in the polarizability of the electron cloud. Therefore, the derivative of the polarizability with respect to the vibrational coordinate is non-zero ($\\frac{d\\alpha}{dq} \\neq 0$). This means the fundamental vibration is also **Raman active**. This is consistent with the observation that Gas 2 also shows a signal in its Raman spectrum.\n\nIn summary, for Gas 2 (heteronuclear): IR active, Raman active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOur analysis concludes:\n- Gas 1 (homonuclear) is IR inactive and Raman active.\n- Gas 2 (heteronuclear) is IR active and Raman active.\n\nNow we compare this conclusion with the given options:\nA.

This exercise challenges you to apply the selection rules to a special and important case: the acoustic mode at wavevector $k=0$, which corresponds to a uniform translation of the entire crystal. Analyzing why this mode is invisible to both IR and Raman spectroscopy is crucial for distinguishing between acoustic and optical branches and for understanding why only certain phonons interact with light [@problem_id:1799636].", "problem": "In the study of crystalline solids, lattice vibrations are quantized as phonons. These vibrational modes are classified into acoustic and optical branches. The acoustic modes at the long-wavelength limit (wavevector $k \\to 0$) correspond to in-phase motion of all atoms in the primitive unit cell. Specifically, the $k=0$ acoustic mode represents a rigid, uniform translation of the entire crystal lattice.\n\nThe interaction of light with these phonons is governed by selection rules. A vibrational mode is Infrared (IR) active if the atomic motion gives rise to an oscillating electric dipole moment. A mode is Raman active if the vibration modulates the crystal's electronic polarizability.\n\nBased on the physical nature of the $k=0$ acoustic mode, which of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete reason for why this mode is never active in either infrared or Raman spectroscopy?\n\nA. The energy of the $k=0$ acoustic phonon is zero, and since both infrared absorption and Raman scattering are energy-conserving processes, an interaction that excites a zero-energy mode is forbidden.\n\nB. The uniform translation of the crystal does not alter the relative positions of the atoms, and thus it neither creates an oscillating net electric dipole moment nor changes the overall electronic polarizability of the crystal.\n\nC. The $k=0$ acoustic mode corresponds to an infinite wavelength, which cannot couple to the finite, shorter wavelength of infrared or visible light, leading to a momentum mismatch that forbids the interaction.\n\nD. This mode is a macroscopic motion of the entire sample, and the quantum selection rules for IR and Raman activity are only applicable to microscopic, internal vibrations within the unit cell, not to bulk translations.\n\nE. Due to crystal symmetry, the group theory character for the irreducible representation corresponding to a uniform translation is always one, which by definition means the transition dipole moment and the polarizability tensor components are zero.", "solution": "An IR-active normal mode requires that the crystalâ€™s macroscopic dipole moment changes linearly with the normal coordinate. Writing the dipole moment as $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\sum_{s} q_{s}\\mathbf{r}_{s}$, a uniform translation by $\\mathbf{u}$ sends $\\mathbf{r}_{s}\\to \\mathbf{r}_{s}+\\mathbf{u}$, hence\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\to \\sum_{s} q_{s}(\\mathbf{r}_{s}+\\mathbf{u})=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}+\\mathbf{u}\\sum_{s} q_{s}.\n$$\nFor a charge-neutral crystal, $\\sum_{s} q_{s}=0$, so the dipole is invariant under uniform translation. In IR-selection-rule form, if $Q$ is the normal coordinate of the $k=0$ acoustic mode, then\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q}=0,\n$$\nso the mode is IR inactive. Equivalently, in terms of the macroscopic polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ and Born effective charges $Z^{*}_{\\kappa}$,\n$$\n\\mathbf{P}=\\frac{1}{\\Omega}\\sum_{\\kappa} Z^{*}_{\\kappa}\\mathbf{u}_{\\kappa},\\quad \\mathbf{u}_{\\kappa}=\\mathbf{u}\\;\\;\\forall\\kappa\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\mathbf{P}=\\frac{\\mathbf{u}}{\\Omega}\\sum_{\\kappa} Z^{*}_{\\kappa}=0,\n$$\nby the acoustic sum rule $\\sum_{\\kappa} Z^{*}_{\\kappa}=0$, again implying no IR activity.\n\nA Raman-active normal mode requires that the electronic polarizability tensor change linearly with the normal coordinate, i.e.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{ij}}{\\partial Q}\\neq 0\n$$\nfor some components. The polarizability $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ depends only on internal (relative) coordinates, which remain unchanged under a uniform translation. Thus, for the $k=0$ acoustic mode,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{ij}}{\\partial Q}=0,\n$$\nso it is Raman inactive.\n\nEnergy- or momentum-based arguments are not the fundamental reason here. Although the $k=0$ acoustic mode has $\\omega=0$, energy conservation does not by itself forbid coupling (elastic Rayleigh scattering has zero energy transfer). Likewise, photon momentum is small and first-order light scattering selects near-zone-center phonons; there is no general momentum-mismatch prohibition at $k\\approx 0$. The decisive point is that a rigid translation neither produces an oscillating dipole nor modulates the polarizability. Therefore, the most accurate and complete statement is that the uniform translation preserves both the net dipole and the polarizability, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1799636"}, {"introduction": "The predictive power of physics truly shines when we can use formal methods to analyze complex, real-world materials.
