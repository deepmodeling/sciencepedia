By equating the total number of phonon modes in a solid to its translational degrees of freedom, we can define a \"Debye sphere\" in k-space that contains all allowed states. This practice guides you in deriving the crucial concept of a cutoff wavevector, $k_D$, which forms the boundary of this sphere [@problem_id:1812966].", "problem": "The Debye model provides a theoretical framework for understanding the thermal properties of solids by treating lattice vibrations as quantized sound waves, or phonons. A central assumption of the model is that the total number of vibrational modes is finite and corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom of the atoms comprising the solid.\n\nConsider a simple, three-dimensional monatomic crystalline solid. The solid has an atomic number density of $n$. For a sample of this solid with volume $V$, the number of allowed wavevector states in k-space is uniformly distributed, with one state occupying a k-space volume of $(2\\pi)^3/V$. In the Debye approximation, the allowed phonon wavevectors are assumed to populate a sphere in k-space of radius $k_D$, known as the Debye cutoff wavevector. This means that all allowed modes have a wavevector magnitude $|\\vec{k}| \\le k_D$.\n\nYour task is to derive an expression for the Debye cutoff wavevector, $k_D$, as a function of the atomic number density $n$. The derivation must be based on the principle that the total number of allowed vibrational modes within the Debye sphere must equal the total number of translational degrees of freedom for the atoms in the solid.", "solution": "The solution proceeds by first determining the total number of degrees of freedom in the solid and then calculating the total number of vibrational modes allowed within the Debye sphere. By equating these two quantities, we can solve for the Debye cutoff wavevector, $k_D$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the total number of degrees of freedom.\nLet the solid have a volume $V$ and an atomic number density $n$. The total number of atoms, $N$, in the solid is given by the product of the density and the volume:\n$$N = nV$$\nFor a monatomic solid in three dimensions, each atom has three translational degrees of freedom. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom for the $N$ atoms is:\n$$\\text{Total degrees of freedom} = 3N = 3nV$$\nAccording to the problem statement, this must be equal to the total number of allowed vibrational modes.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the total number of allowed vibrational modes.\nThe problem states that there is one allowed wavevector state for every k-space volume of $(2\\pi)^3/V$. This means the density of wavevector states in k-space is the reciprocal of this volume, i.e., the number of states per unit volume of k-space is $\\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3}$.\n\nIn a 3D solid, for each allowed wavevector $\\vec{k}$, there are three distinct vibrational modes (polarizations): one longitudinal and two transverse. Therefore, the number density of vibrational modes in k-space is three times the density of wavevector states:\n$$\\rho_{\\text{modes}}(\\vec{k}) = 3 \\times \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} = \\frac{3V}{8\\pi^3}$$\nThis density is uniform within the Debye sphere.\n\nTo find the total number of modes, we must integrate this density over the entire allowed volume in k-space, which is a sphere of radius $k_D$ (the Debye sphere).\n$$\\text{Total modes} = \\int_{|\\vec{k}| \\le k_D} \\rho_{\\text{modes}}(\\vec{k}) \\,d^3k$$\nSince the density $\\rho_{\\text{modes}}$ is constant, the integral is simply the density multiplied by the volume of the Debye sphere. The volume of a sphere of radius $k_D$ in k-space is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_D^3$.\n$$\\text{Total modes} = \\left(\\frac{3V}{8\\pi^3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_D^3\\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$\\text{Total modes} = \\frac{12\\pi V k_D^3}{24\\pi^3} = \\frac{V k_D^3}{2\\pi^2}$$\n\nStep 3: Equate the number of modes and degrees of freedom to find $k_D$.\nWe now equate the total number of vibrational modes with the total number of degrees of freedom:\n$$\\frac{V k_D^3}{2\\pi^2} = 3nV$$\nThe volume $V$ appears on both sides of the equation and can be canceled out:\n$$\\frac{k_D^3}{2\\pi^2} = 3n$$\nNow, we solve for $k_D$. First, multiply both sides by $2\\pi^2$:\n$$k_D^3 = 6\\pi^2 n$$\nFinally, take the cube root of both sides to find the expression for the Debye cutoff wavevector:\n$$k_D = (6\\pi^2 n)^{\\frac{1}{3}}$$\nThis is the final expression for the Debye cutoff wavevector in terms of the atomic number density $n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(6 \\pi^{2} n)^{\\frac{1}{3}}}$$", "id": "1812966"}, {"introduction": "The relationship between a phonon's frequency $\\omega$ and its wavevector $k$, the dispersion relation, directly shapes the density of states $g(\\omega)$.
