This relationship is known as the phonon dispersion relation.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the core assumption of the Einstein model. In this model, every atom in the solid is treated as an independent quantum harmonic oscillator, and crucially, all these oscillators share the exact same angular frequency, $\\omega_E$.\n\nThe energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator is quantized. The energy levels are given by $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\hbar\\omega_E$, where $n$ is an integer quantum number. A phonon is a quantum of vibrational energy. The creation of a single phonon corresponds to an oscillator transitioning from a state with quantum number $n$ to $n+1$.

We are told the scattering event creates a single phonon.\n\nLet the initial energy and momentum of the neutron be $E_i$ and $\\vec{p}_i$, and the final energy and momentum be $E_f$ and $\\vec{p}_f$. The energy and momentum of the created phonon are $E_{phonon}$ and $\\vec{p}_{phonon}$.\n\nThe conservation of energy dictates:\n$$ E_i = E_f + E_{phonon} $$\nThe energy transfer $\\Delta E$ from the neutron to the crystal is defined as the energy lost by the neutron, which is equal to the energy of the created phonon:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_i - E_f = E_{phonon} $$\n\nThe conservation of momentum dictates:\n$$ \\vec{p}_i = \\vec{p}_f + \\vec{p}_{phonon} $$\nThe momentum transferred from the neutron to the crystal is the momentum of the created phonon. The momentum of a phonon is related to its wavevector $\\vec{q}$ by $\\vec{p}_{phonon} = \\hbar\\vec{q}$. The momentum transfer from the neutron is:\n$$ \\hbar\\Delta\\vec{k} = \\vec{p}_i - \\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_{phonon} = \\hbar\\vec{q} $$\nThis implies that the momentum transfer wavevector $\\Delta\\vec{k}$ is identical to the phonon's wavevector $\\vec{q}$. So, the magnitude of the momentum transfer wavevector is $\\Delta k = |\\Delta\\vec{k}| = |\\vec{q}| = q$.\n\nNow we combine these insights. The energy of the created phonon is $E_{phonon} = \\hbar\\omega_E$. The energy transfer measured in the experiment is $\\Delta E = E_{phonon}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega_E $$\nThis equation shows that the energy transfer $\\Delta E$ is a constant value, completely independent of the phonon wavevector magnitude $q$, and thus independent of the measured momentum transfer wavevector magnitude $\\Delta k$. The dispersion relation $\\Delta E(\\Delta k)$ is a constant function.\n\nThis result highlights a key failure of the Einstein model. In real materials, atoms are coupled, allowing vibrations to propagate as waves. This leads to a dispersion relation where the phonon energy $\\Delta E$ *does* depend on the momentum transfer $\\Delta k$, typically starting at $\\Delta E = 0$ for $\\Delta k = 0$ and increasing for larger $\\Delta k$ (in the acoustic branch). The Einstein model predicts a \"flat\" dispersion curve, which contradicts experimental observations from inelastic neutron scattering on real solids.\n\nThus, the expression for the energy transfer $\\Delta E$ as a function of the momentum transfer wavevector magnitude $\\Delta k$ is simply a constant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\hbar \\omega_{E}}$$", "id": "1788009"}]}
