When a photon scatters inelastically from a crystal, it can either transfer energy to the lattice by creating a phonon (a Stokes process) or gain energy by absorbing a phonon that already exists (an anti-Stokes process). This first practice problem [@problem_id:1783885] provides a direct application of this principle, allowing you to perform a fundamental calculation that connects experimentally measured photon energies to the energy of the specific phonon involved in the interaction.", "problem": "A physicist is using a laser-based scattering technique to characterize the vibrational properties of a newly synthesized transparent crystal. A beam of photons, each with a precisely known energy of $E_i = 2.332 \\text{ eV}$, is directed onto the crystal sample. Most photons pass through or scatter elastically, but a small fraction scatters inelastically from the crystal's lattice vibrations. A high-resolution spectrometer measures the energy of these scattered photons. One particular signal of interest corresponds to scattered photons with a measured energy of $E_f = 2.3964 \\text{ eV}$. This energy increase in the photon is the result of absorbing a single quantum of lattice vibration, a phonon, that was thermally excited within the crystal.

An anti-Stokes process, where a photon gains energy, requires the absorption of a pre-existing phonon from the crystal lattice. This insightful conceptual problem [@problem_id:1783808] challenges you to explore this requirement through a thought experiment at absolute zero ($T=0$ K), revealing the fundamental quantum mechanical reason for the asymmetry often observed between Stokes and anti-Stokes signals.", "problem": "An experimental physicist is investigating the properties of a highly pure, crystalline solid. The solid is placed inside a cryostat and cooled to a temperature indistinguishable from absolute zero ($T=0$ K). A monochromatic laser beam with a well-defined photon energy, $E_{\\text{in}}$, is directed at the crystal. A sensitive spectrometer is set up to analyze the energy spectrum of the light scattered by the crystal.\n\nInelastic scattering events, where photons exchange energy with the vibrational modes of the crystal lattice (phonons), can lead to scattered photons with energies different from $E_{\\text{in}}$.

Both Stokes and anti-Stokes lines will be observed with comparable intensities, because quantum mechanics allows for energy to be both given to and taken from the lattice regardless of temperature.\n\nB. Only Stokes lines will be observed. This is because the crystal lattice at absolute zero is in its ground state and can only gain energy from an incident photon by creating a phonon, but has no pre-existing thermal vibrational energy to give to a photon.\n\nC. Only anti-Stokes lines will be observed. This is because the lattice's non-zero ground-state energy (zero-point energy) provides a source of energy that can be transferred to the incident photons.\n\nD. Neither Stokes nor anti-Stokes lines will be observed. At absolute zero, the crystal lattice is perfectly static and rigid, preventing any vibrational interaction with photons.\n\nE. Both Stokes and anti-Stokes lines will be observed, but the anti-Stokes lines will be extremely weak compared to the Stokes lines. This occurs because the spontaneous creation of a phonon is a much more probable quantum process than the absorption of a phonon.", "solution": "We consider inelastic light scattering by phonons in a crystal at temperature $T=0$.

In an anti-Stokes scattering process, an incident photon and a phonon are annihilated, and a scattered photon is created. Let $\\Omega$ be the angular frequency of the specific phonon mode being studied.\n\nThe observed intensity of the scattered light is governed by two main principles:\n1.  From classical electrodynamics, the power radiated by an oscillating electric dipole is proportional to the fourth power of its oscillation frequency. Consequently, the intensity of scattered light is proportional to $\\omega^4$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the scattered photon.\n2.  From a quantum mechanical treatment of the light-matter interaction, the probability of a scattering event is related to the number of phonons, $N_{ph}$, present in the vibrational mode just before the interaction.
