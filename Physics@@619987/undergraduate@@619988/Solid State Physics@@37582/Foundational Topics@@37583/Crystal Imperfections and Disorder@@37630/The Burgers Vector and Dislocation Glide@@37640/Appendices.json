The characteristics of a dislocation are encapsulated by its Burgers vector, $\\vec{b}$. For a perfect dislocation, which preserves the crystal lattice structure, the Burgers vector corresponds to a translation vector that connects two equivalent lattice sites. In a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal, the most common and energetically favorable perfect dislocations are those with the shortest possible Burgers vector.\n\nConsider an FCC crystal structure described by a conventional cubic unit cell with a lattice constant of $a$.

Plastic deformation occurs when dislocations glide along specific crystallographic planes, and this motion is driven by shear stress. This practice problem [@problem_id:1810589] introduces the crucial concept of the Schmid factor, a geometric term that determines how much of an externally applied tensile stress is effectively resolved into the shear stress needed to initiate slip.

The resolved shear stress is proportional to the applied tensile stress, where the constant of proportionality is known as the Schmid factor.\n\nFor a particular orientation of the single crystal, a combination of electron backscatter diffraction and mechanical testing reveals the orientation of the active slip system relative to the axis of the applied tensile stress. The angle between the tensile axis and the normal vector to the slip plane is measured to be $\\phi = 38.9^{\\circ}$. The angle between the tensile axis and the slip direction within that plane is measured as $\\lambda = 53.1^{\\circ}$.\n\nCalculate the Schmid factor for this specific slip system.
