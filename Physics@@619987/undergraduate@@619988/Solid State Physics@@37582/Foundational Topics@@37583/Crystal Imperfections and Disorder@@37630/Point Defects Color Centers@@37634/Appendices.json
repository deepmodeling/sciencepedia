This practice challenges you to apply the particle-in-a-box model from the previous exercise to a more complex situation: the formation of an M-center from two adjacent F-centers. Instead of a calculation, this is a conceptual problem that tests your understanding of how quantum confinement and particle delocalization affect energy levels, allowing you to predict the resulting shift in the material's color.", "problem": "In certain ionic crystals, such as potassium chloride (KCl), vacant anion sites can trap free electrons. Such a defect is known as an F-center (from the German *Farbzentrum*, meaning color center). These F-centers are responsible for imparting color to the otherwise transparent crystal by strongly absorbing light at a specific wavelength. The absorption is due to the excitation of the trapped electron from its quantum ground state to the first excited state.\n\nSuppose that a sample of KCl containing a dilute concentration of isolated F-centers is subjected to a thermal annealing process. This process allows the F-centers to become mobile and aggregate. A significant portion of the F-centers combine to form M-centers, where an M-center consists of a pair of adjacent F-centers. This new M-center contains two electrons shared between the two adjacent anion vacancies.\n\nBased on fundamental quantum mechanical principles, how is the wavelength of the primary optical absorption peak expected to shift when an F-center is converted into an M-center?\n\nA. The absorption peak will shift to a shorter wavelength because the two electrons in the M-center repel each other, increasing the transition energy.\n\nB. The absorption peak will shift to a longer wavelength because the electrons can be delocalized over a larger volume, which decreases the energy difference between the ground and first excited states.\n\nC. The absorption peak wavelength will remain unchanged because the fundamental nature of an anion vacancy as the trapping site is not altered.\n\nD. The single absorption peak will split into two new peaks, one at a shorter and one at a longer wavelength than the original F-center peak, due to the presence of two vacancies.\n\nE. It is impossible to qualitatively predict the direction of the shift without precise numerical values for the crystal's lattice constant and the effective mass of the electron.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine how the wavelength of peak optical absorption changes when two F-centers combine to form an M-center. The absorption corresponds to the energy required to promote a trapped electron from its ground state to its first excited state. The relationship between the absorption energy, $\\Delta E$, and the corresponding wavelength, $\\lambda$, is given by $\\Delta E = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. This means a larger energy gap corresponds to a shorter wavelength, and a smaller energy gap corresponds to a longer wavelength.\n\nTo analyze the energy gap, we can use a simplified but powerful quantum mechanical model: the particle in a box.\n\nStep 1: Model the F-center.\nAn F-center consists of a single electron trapped in a single anion vacancy. We can model this as a particle (the electron) confined to a one-dimensional box of length $L$, where $L$ is on the order of the crystal lattice spacing. The allowed energy levels for a particle of mass $m$ in an infinite potential well of length $L$ are given by:\n$$E_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8 m L^2}, \\quad \\text{for } n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$$\nThe ground state is the $n=1$ state, and the first excited state is the $n=2$ state. The energy of the absorbed photon for an F-center, $\\Delta E_F$, corresponds to the transition from $n=1$ to $n=2$:\n$$\\Delta E_F = E_2 - E_1 = \\frac{2^2 h^2}{8 m L^2} - \\frac{1^2 h^2}{8 m L^2} = \\frac{3 h^2}{8 m L^2}$$\n\nStep 2: Model the M-center.\nAn M-center consists of two electrons shared between two adjacent anion vacancies. From the perspective of the electrons, they are now free to move across both vacancies. This means the effective \"box\" in which the electrons are confined is larger. As a first approximation, we can model this system as a single, larger box of length $L' \\approx 2L$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the absorption energy for the M-center.\nThe energy levels for this new, larger box of length $L' = 2L$ are:\n$$E'_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8 m (L')^2} = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8 m (2L)^2} = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{32 m L^2}$$\nThe M-center has two electrons. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, both electrons can occupy the ground state ($n=1$), provided they have opposite spins. The primary optical absorption corresponds to exciting one of these electrons to the next available energy level, which is the first excited state ($n=2$). Therefore, the transition is still from $n=1$ to $n=2$. The energy of this transition for the M-center, $\\Delta E_M$, is:\n$$\\Delta E_M = E'_2 - E'_1 = \\frac{2^2 h^2}{32 m L^2} - \\frac{1^2 h^2}{32 m L^2} = \\frac{3 h^2}{32 m L^2}$$\n\nStep 4: Compare the transition energies and wavelengths.\nNow we compare the transition energy of the M-center to that of the F-center:\n$$\\Delta E_M = \\frac{3 h^2}{32 m L^2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{3 h^2}{8 m L^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\Delta E_F$$\nThis shows that the energy required for the primary electronic excitation in an M-center is significantly smaller than that for an F-center ($\\Delta E_M  \\Delta E_F$).\n\nSince the wavelength is inversely proportional to the energy ($\\lambda = hc/\\Delta E$), a smaller transition energy implies a longer wavelength. Therefore, we have $\\lambda_M  \\lambda_F$. The absorption peak shifts to a longer wavelength (a \"red-shift\").\n\nThis physical result stems from the delocalization of the electrons. By being able to move over a larger region (two vacancies instead of one), the electrons' kinetic energy is lowered. This leads to the energy levels being more closely spaced, reducing the energy gap between the ground and first excited states.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. Incorrect. While electron-electron repulsion does exist and raises the overall energy of the system, the dominant effect on the *transition* energy is the reduction in kinetic energy due to the larger confinement volume.\nB. Correct. This option accurately describes the core physical principle. The electrons are delocalized over the larger volume of the two adjacent vacancies. The \"larger box\" leads to more closely spaced energy levels, a smaller transition energy ($\\Delta E$), and thus a longer absorption wavelength ($\\lambda$).\nC. Incorrect. The aggregation of two F-centers creates a new defect center with distinct electronic properties and a different potential landscape for the trapped electrons.\nD. Incorrect. While a more advanced treatment involving molecular orbitals would show that the single-center energy levels split into symmetric and anti-symmetric combinations, the lowest-energy transition for the M-center is at a lower energy (longer wavelength) than the F-center transition. Option B provides the best overall description of the shift for the primary peak.\nE. Incorrect. The qualitative direction of the shift is a direct consequence of fundamental quantum principles (the uncertainty principle or the particle-in-a-box model) and does not require knowledge of specific material parameters. We can predict the shift will be to a longer wavelength regardless of the exact numbers.\n\nThe correct conclusion is that the absorption peak shifts to a longer wavelength.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1797494"}]}
