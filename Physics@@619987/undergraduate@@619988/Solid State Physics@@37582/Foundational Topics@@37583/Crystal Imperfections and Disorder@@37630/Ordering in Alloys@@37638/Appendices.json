Consider a binary alloy composed of A and B atoms which crystallizes into the B2 (Cesium Chloride, CsCl) structure. This structure can be described as two interpenetrating simple cubic sublattices, which we will call the $\\alpha$-sublattice and the $\\beta$-sublattice. Each sublattice contains exactly half of the total atomic sites in the crystal.\n\nIn an ordered state, one type of atom preferentially occupies one sublattice. Let's assume A atoms preferentially occupy the $\\alpha$-sublattice and B atoms preferentially occupy the $\\beta$-sublattice. A useful definition for the LRO parameter, $S$, is given by:\n$$S = f_A^\\alpha - f_A^\\beta$$\nwhere $f_A^\\alpha$ is the fraction of sites on the A-preferred sublattice ($\\alpha$) that are occupied by A atoms, and $f_A^\\beta$ is the fraction of sites on the B-preferred sublattice ($\\beta$) that are occupied by A atoms.

We assume A atoms prefer the $\\alpha$-sublattice and B atoms prefer the $\\beta$-sublattice.\n\n**Part 1: Stoichiometric Alloy (AB)**\n\nFor a stoichiometric AB alloy, the overall atomic fractions are $c_A = 0.5$ and $c_B = 0.5$.\nThe total number of A atoms is $N_A = c_A N = 0.5N$.\nThe total number of B atoms is $N_B = c_B N = 0.5N$.\n\nThe number of available sites on the $\\alpha$-sublattice is $N/2 = 0.5N$.\nThe number of available sites on the $\\beta$-sublattice is $N/2 = 0.5N$.\n\nTo achieve the maximum possible order, we place all A atoms on their preferred $\\alpha$-sublattice and all B atoms on their preferred $\\beta$-sublattice.\n- Number of A atoms on $\\alpha$-sites: Since we have $0.5N$ A atoms and $0.5N$ $\\alpha$-sites, we can place all A atoms on the $\\alpha$-sublattice.\n- Number of B atoms on $\\beta$-sites: Similarly, we can place all $0.5N$ B atoms on the $0.5N$ available $\\beta$-sites.\n\nNow, we calculate the fractions required for the LRO parameter:\n- $f_A^\\alpha$: The fraction of $\\alpha$-sites occupied by A atoms. This is the number of A atoms on $\\alpha$-sites divided by the total number of $\\alpha$-sites.\n$$f_A^\\alpha = \\frac{0.5N}{0.5N} = 1$$\n- $f_A^\\beta$: The fraction of $\\beta$-sites occupied by A atoms.

A is the majority component, so it prefers the $\\alpha$-sublattice. B is the minority component, preferring the $\\beta$-sublattice.\n- The A-preferred $\\alpha$-sublattice has only $0.5N$ sites, but we have $0.6N$ A atoms. Therefore, at most $0.5N$ A atoms can occupy their correct sublattice. The remaining $0.6N - 0.5N = 0.1N$ A atoms are \"excess\" and must occupy sites on the B-preferred $\\beta$-sublattice. These are known as anti-site defects.\n- The B-preferred $\\beta$-sublattice has $0.5N$ sites and we have $0.4N$ B atoms. All B atoms can be accommodated on their preferred sublattice.\n\nLet's summarize the site occupations in this maximally ordered state:\n- On the $\\alpha$-sublattice (total $0.5N$ sites): All sites are filled by A atoms. So, $0.5N$ A atoms are on $\\alpha$-sites.\n- On the $\\beta$-sublattice (total $0.5N$ sites): We have $0.4N$ B atoms and the $0.1N$ excess A atoms.\n\nNow, we calculate the fractions for the LRO parameter:\n- $f_A^\\alpha$: The fraction of $\\alpha$-sites occupied by A atoms.\n$$f_A^\\alpha = \\frac{\\text{Number of A atoms on } \\alpha\\text{-sites}}{\\text{Total number of } \\alpha\\text{-sites}} = \\frac{0.5N}{0.5N} = 1$$\n- $f_A^\\beta$: The fraction of $\\beta$-sites occupied by A atoms.\n$$f_A^\\beta = \\frac{\\text{Number of A atoms on } \\beta\\text{-sites}}{\\text{Total number of } \\beta\\text{-sites}} = \\frac{0.1N}{0.5N} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\n\nUsing the definition of the LRO parameter, the maximum value for the non-stoichiometric case is:\n$$S_{max,non-stoich} = f_A^\\alpha - f_A^\\beta = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$$\n\nThe pair of values is ($S_{max,stoich}$, $S_{max,non-stoich}$) = (1.0, 0.8).
