An ATM molecule, confined within a \"cage\" of its neighbors, can only execute a diffusive jump if a void of a sufficient size opens up adjacent to it. This requires the local free volume, $v$, to be greater than or equal to a critical volume, $v^*$.\n2.  The total free volume in the system is randomly redistributed among the molecules.
