The formula for this quantity is explicitly given in the problem statement.\n\nLet the relative atomic size difference be denoted by $\\delta$. The definition provided is:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{|r_{\\text{solute}} - r_{\\text{solvent}}|}{r_{\\text{solvent}}}\n$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we identify the radii for the solute and solvent atoms:\nThe solvent is aluminum (Al), so its radius is $r_{\\text{solvent}} = r_{\\text{Al}} = 0.143 \\text{ nm}$.\nThe solute is magnesium (Mg), so its radius is $r_{\\text{solute}} = r_{\\text{Mg}} = 0.160 \\text{ nm}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the absolute difference in the atomic radii:\n$$\n|r_{\\text{solute}} - r_{\\text{solvent}}| = |r_{\\text{Mg}} - r_{\\text{Al}}| = |0.160 \\text{ nm} - 0.143 \\text{ nm}| = |0.017 \\text{ nm}| = 0.017 \\text{ nm}\n$$\n\nNext, we substitute this difference and the solvent radius into the formula for the relative size difference:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{0.017 \\text{ nm}}{0.143 \\text{ nm}}\n$$\n\nThe units of nanometers (nm) in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving a dimensionless quantity as expected.

Instead, the general expectation is limited mutual solubility: each end member will form a terminal solid solution with the crystal structure of the solvent—an X-rich BCC solid solution (often denoted $\\alpha$) and a Y-rich HCP solid solution (often denoted $\\beta$)—with a two-phase region $\\alpha + \\beta$ separating them over intermediate compositions.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- Option A describes an isomorphous system with a single continuous $\\alpha$ phase, which requires identical crystal structures; this contradicts the given BCC vs HCP difference, so it is not expected.\n- Option B describes two terminal solid solutions separated by a two-phase region, which is the hallmark outcome when crystal structures differ while other Hume-Rothery factors are favorable; this matches the expected key feature.\n- Option C asserts no solid solubility at all, which is too extreme given that other factors are favorable; limited solubility is expected, not zero.\n- Option D posits a single intermetallic at exactly 0.5 composition with no solubility; formation of a line compound is not implied solely by structural difference and, moreover, the favorable factors would typically still allow some terminal solubility.\n- Option E specifies a peritectic reaction; while possible in some systems, such a reaction is not a necessary or general consequence of differing crystal structures alone and is therefore not the most generally expected key feature.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate description, based solely on the difference in crystal structure, is two terminal solid solutions separated by a two-phase region.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1782041"}, {"introduction": "Effective alloy design requires a holistic approach, simultaneously considering all the factors that govern solid solution formation.
