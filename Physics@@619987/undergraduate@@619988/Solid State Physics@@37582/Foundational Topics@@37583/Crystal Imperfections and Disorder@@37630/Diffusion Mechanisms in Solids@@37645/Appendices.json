This process can be modeled as a three-dimensional random walk where the atom resides at a lattice site for an average duration before jumping. The distance between any two adjacent lattice sites is a constant, denoted by $a$. The macroscopic effect of these atomic jumps is characterized by a temperature-dependent diffusion coefficient, $D$.\n\nAssuming the diffusion is isotropic and occurs only between adjacent lattice sites, derive an expression for the average time, $\\tau$, that an atom spends at a particular lattice site before making a jump.
