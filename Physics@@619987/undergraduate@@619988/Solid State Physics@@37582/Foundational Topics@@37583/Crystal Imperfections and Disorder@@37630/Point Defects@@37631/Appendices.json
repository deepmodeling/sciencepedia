When CaCl$_2$ is added to KCl, a Ca$^{2+}$ ion substitutes for a K$^{+}$ ion on a regular cation lattice site. The K$^{+}$ ion has a charge of $+e$, while the Ca$^{2+}$ ion has a charge of $+2e$. To maintain charge neutrality in the crystal, this introduction of an excess positive charge ($+e$) must be compensated by a corresponding negative charge. This compensation is achieved through the creation of a cation vacancy, which is the absence of a K$^{+}$ ion. A missing K$^{+}$ ion leaves behind an effective charge of $-e$ at that site. Therefore, for every one Ca$^{2+}$ ion substitution, one K$^{+}$ vacancy is created. This means the concentration of K$^{+}$ vacancies, $[V_K']$, is equal to the concentration of the dopant Ca$^{2+}$ ions, $[Ca^{2+}]$.\n\nOur goal is to calculate $[Ca^{2+}]$. The dopant level is given as 0.0100 mole percent.

Each CaCl$_2$ unit provides one Ca$^{2+}$ ion. Thus, the ratio of the number of Ca$^{2+}$ ions to the number of KCl formula units is also $1.00 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n$$\n\\frac{N_{Ca^{2+}}}{N_{KCl}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nTo find the concentration of Ca$^{2+}$ ions (number per unit volume), we can write:\n$$\n[Ca^{2+}] = \\frac{N_{Ca^{2+}}}{V} = \\left(\\frac{N_{Ca^{2+}}}{N_{KCl}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{N_{KCl}}{V}\\right) = (1.00 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times [N_{sites}]\n$$\nwhere $[N_{sites}]$ is the number density of KCl formula units (which is also the number density of cation sites).\n\nNext, we calculate $[N_{sites}]$.
