For a perfect crystalline solid at absolute zero temperature, this function simplifies to a series of discrete, infinitely sharp peaks.

In an SC lattice, atoms are positioned at the corners of a conceptual cube which repeats throughout the crystal. We can define the side length of this cube as the lattice constant, $a$. By placing a reference atom at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ of a Cartesian coordinate system, the positions of all other atoms in the lattice can be described by coordinate vectors $(ia, ja, ka)$, where $i, j,$ and $k$ are integers, and not all three are zero simultaneously.\n\nThe first peak in the radial distribution function for this lattice occurs at a distance $r_1$, corresponding to the set of first nearest-neighbors.
