The atomic arrangement in this crystal can be modeled as a primitive rectangular Bravais lattice. This lattice is defined by two orthogonal primitive vectors, $\\vec{a}_1$ and $\\vec{a}_2$, oriented along the x and y axes respectively. The magnitudes of these vectors, known as the lattice constants, are $|\\vec{a}_1| = a$ and $|\\vec{a}_2| = b$.\n\nGenerally, the material is anisotropic, with $a \\neq b$. However, it is theorized that by applying a specific type of external strain, the material could undergo a structural phase transition. At the critical point of this transition, the lattice is expected to acquire a higher degree of symmetry, specifically, a four-fold rotational symmetry.\n\nA lattice is said to possess four-fold rotational symmetry about its lattice points if, for any vector $\\vec{R}$ pointing from one lattice point to another, the vector $\\vec{R}'$ obtained by rotating $\\vec{R}$ by $90^\\circ$ is also a vector that connects two lattice points.\n\nWhat relationship must exist between the lattice constants $a$ and $b$ for this primitive rectangular lattice to gain four-fold rotational symmetry?\n\nA. $a = \\sqrt{3} b$\n\nB. $a = 2b$\n\nC. $a = b$\n\nD. $a = \\sqrt{2} b$\n\nE.
