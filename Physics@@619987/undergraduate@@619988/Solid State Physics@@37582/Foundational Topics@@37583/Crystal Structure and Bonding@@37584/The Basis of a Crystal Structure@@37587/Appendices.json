This exercise demonstrates this principle by asking you to deconstruct the familiar Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure. By representing it as a Simple Cubic (SC) lattice decorated with a multi-atom basis, you will gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental relationship between a lattice and a basis [@problem_id:1809012].", "problem": "In solid-state physics, a crystal structure is described by the combination of a lattice and a basis. The lattice is an infinite, periodic array of mathematical points in space, while the basis is an identical group of one or more atoms that is attached to every lattice point.\n\nConsider the Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) crystal structure. The conventional unit cell of a BCC structure is a cube of side length $a$ with atoms at all eight corners and one atom at the geometric center of the cube. It is a valuable exercise to construct this structure by starting with a simpler lattice. An alternative and more fundamental description is to represent the BCC structure using a Simple Cubic (SC) lattice with a multi-atom basis. An SC lattice with lattice constant $a$ is defined by the set of all points $\\vec{R} = n_1 a\\hat{x} + n_2 a\\hat{y} + n_3 a\\hat{z}$, where $n_1, n_2, \\text{and } n_3$ are any integers. This corresponds to a grid of points forming the vertices of cubes of side length $a$.\n\nTo construct the BCC structure from this underlying SC lattice, what is the set of basis vectors $\\{\\vec{d}_j\\}$ that must be placed at each lattice point? Express your answer as a matrix where each row represents the coordinates $(d_{jx}, d_{jy}, d_{jz})$ of one atom in the basis, expressed as fractions of the lattice constant $a$. Assume one of the lattice points is at the origin $(0,0,0)$ and list the basis atom located at the origin first.", "solution": "We start from the specified Simple Cubic (SC) Bravais lattice with lattice constant $a$, whose lattice vectors are $\\vec{R}=n_{1}a\\hat{x}+n_{2}a\\hat{y}+n_{3}a\\hat{z}$ with $n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. A crystal structure is obtained by placing a fixed set of basis vectors $\\{\\vec{d}_{j}\\}$ at every lattice point $\\vec{R}$; the total set of atomic positions is $\\{\\vec{R}+\\vec{d}_{j}\\}$.\n\nFor a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure in this conventional cubic setting, each conventional cubic cell of side $a$ has one atom at the cube corner and one at the cube body center. To realize this with an SC lattice, choose a two-atom basis:\n- One atom at the origin relative to the lattice point, $\\vec{d}_{1}=(0,0,0)$.\n- One atom at the center of the cube relative to the lattice point, $\\vec{d}_{2}=\\left(\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2}\\right)$.\n\nPlacing these at every $\\vec{R}$ generates the set\n$$\n\\{\\vec{R}+\\vec{d}_{1}\\}=\\{\\vec{R}\\},\n\\quad\n\\{\\vec{R}+\\vec{d}_{2}\\}=\\left\\{\\vec{R}+\\left(\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\right\\},\n$$\nwhich are precisely the corner sites (all SC lattice points) and the body-center sites of every cube of side $a$, respectively.

A $90^{\\circ}$ rotation $C_{4}$ about any lattice point $\\vec{R}_{0}$ maps $\\vec{R}_{0}+d\\hat{y}$ to $\\vec{R}_{0}+d\\hat{x}$. For $C_{4}$ to be a symmetry, $\\vec{R}_{0}+d\\hat{x}$ must belong to $\\mathcal{S}$, i.e., there must exist integers $m,n$ and $j\\in\\{1,2\\}$ such that\n$$\n\\vec{R}_{0}+d\\hat{x}=m\\vec{a}_{1}+n\\vec{a}_{2}+\\vec{r}_{j}.\n$$\nEquivalently,\n$$\n\\vec{R}_{0}-\\bigl(m\\vec{a}_{1}+n\\vec{a}_{2}\\bigr)=\\vec{r}_{j}-d\\hat{x}.\n$$\nThe left-hand side is a lattice vector with Cartesian components that are integer multiples of $a$. The right-hand side has $x$-component $-d$ and $y$-component either $0$ (if $j=1$) or $d$ (if $j=2$). Since $0da$, $-d$ is not an integer multiple of $a$, hence no such $m,n,j$ exist. Therefore $C_{4}$ is not a symmetry of $\\mathcal{S}$, and the original fourfold rotational symmetry is broken. Thus A is false.\n\n2) Test of whether $\\mathcal{S}$ is itself a Bravais lattice (Option B). A set of points is a Bravais lattice if and only if any point can be translated to any other by a lattice vector of the set. In $\\mathcal{S}$ there are two sublattices: $\\{\\vec{R}\\}$ and $\\{\\vec{R}+d\\hat{y}\\}$. If $\\mathcal{S}$ were a Bravais lattice, then the vector connecting these two sublattices, $d\\hat{y}$, would have to be a lattice translation of $\\mathcal{S}$. But all translational symmetries of $\\mathcal{S}$ are integer combinations of $\\vec{a}_{1}$ and $\\vec{a}_{2}$ (adding the basis does not introduce new translations), and $d\\hat{y}$ is not an integer multiple of $a\\hat{y}$ for $0da$. Hence $d\\hat{y}$ is not a lattice translation, and $\\mathcal{S}$ is not a Bravais lattice (except for special commensurate choices such as $d=a$, which are excluded, or $d=a/2$ yielding a special case). Thus B is false in the stated setup.\n\n3) Appropriate conventional unit cell in light of reduced symmetry (Option C). The translational symmetry remains generated by $\\vec{a}_{1}$ and $\\vec{a}_{2}$, so the primitive cell area is still $a^{2}$. However, the point symmetry is reduced because $C_{4}$ is lost (as shown above). When the fourfold rotational symmetry of the square lattice is broken by the basis, the plane symmetry is reduced to one of the rectangular wallpaper groups (e.g., $p2mm$, $pm$, or $p1$ depending on the presence of mirrors), and the conventional cell reflecting the symmetry is rectangular rather than square. Therefore the most appropriate conventional unit cell to describe the full crystal structure (including its point symmetries) is rectangular. Thus C is correct.\n\n4) Equivalence to a centered rectangular lattice (Option D). For general $0da$, the set $\\mathcal{S}$ is a union of two translates of a square lattice by a nonlattice vector $d\\hat{y}$; this is not equivalent to a centered rectangular lattice. Only special commensurate choices (such as $d=a/2$) can be recast into a centered or primitive rectangular Bravais lattice description; the general statement is false. Thus D is false.\n\n5) Number of atoms per primitive unit cell of area $a^{2}$ (Option E). A primitive cell of the translational lattice contains exactly one lattice point. With the two-atom basis at each lattice point, the number of atoms per primitive cell is $2$, not $1$. Thus E is false.\n\nFrom the above, only statement C correctly describes the resulting crystal structure in the stated general case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1809002"}, {"introduction": "The arrangement of atoms within the unit cell—the basis—leaves a direct fingerprint on the crystal's diffraction pattern.
