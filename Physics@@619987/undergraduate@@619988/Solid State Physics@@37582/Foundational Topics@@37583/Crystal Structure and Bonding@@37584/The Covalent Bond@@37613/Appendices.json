Astratium is located below Germanium (Ge) in the periodic table.\n\nStep 1: Determine the relative atomic size.\nThe elements in Group 14 are arranged vertically in the periodic table. The order from top to bottom is Carbon (C), Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), and then our hypothetical Astratium (Asm). A fundamental periodic trend is that atomic radius increases as one moves down a group. This is because each subsequent element in a group has its valence electrons in a higher principal energy level (a new electron shell), which is further from the nucleus. Additionally, the increased number of inner-shell electrons provides greater shielding of the nuclear charge, reducing the effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence electrons and allowing them to be further from the nucleus.\nTherefore, the atomic radii follow the order:\n$$\n\\text{Radius(C)} < \\text{Radius(Si)} < \\text{Radius(Ge)} < \\text{Radius(Asm)}\n$$\nSo, the atomic radius of Astratium is significantly larger than the atomic radius of Silicon.\n\nStep 2: Relate atomic size to covalent bond length.\nIn a covalent crystal like the diamond cubic structure, the bond length is the distance between the centers of two adjacent, bonded atoms. A good approximation for this distance is the sum of the covalent radii of the two atoms. Since all atoms in the Astratium and Silicon crystals are of a single type, the bond length is approximately twice the covalent radius of the respective atom.\n$$\nd_{\\text{bond}} \\approx 2 \\times r_{\\text{covalent}}\n$$\nSince the atomic (and thus covalent) radius of Astratium is larger than that of Silicon, the internuclear distance between two bonded Astratium atoms will be greater than that between two bonded Silicon atoms.\n$$\n\\text{Bond Length(Asm)} > \\text{Bond Length(Si)}\n$$\n\nStep 3: Relate bond length to bond strength.\nBond strength is a measure of the energy required to break a covalent bond. Generally, there is an inverse relationship between bond length and bond strength. Longer bonds are weaker, and shorter bonds are stronger. This is because the strength of a covalent bond arises from the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nuclei and the shared, negatively charged electrons in the bond. When the bond length increases, the shared electrons are, on average, farther from both nuclei. This greater separation results in a weaker electrostatic attraction, and thus a lower energy is required to break the bond.\nSince we established that the bond length in Astratium is longer than in Silicon, it follows that the bond in Astratium will be weaker.\n$$\n\\text{Bond Strength(Asm)} < \\text{Bond Strength(Si)}\n$$\n\nStep 4: Combine the findings and select the correct option.\nOur analysis leads to two conclusions:\n1. The bond length in Astratium will be longer than in Silicon.\n2. The bond strength in Astratium will be weaker than in Silicon.\n\nNow we match these conclusions with the given options:\nA. The bond length in Astratium will be shorter than in Silicon, and the bond strength will be greater. (Incorrect)\nB. The bond length in Astratium will be longer than in Silicon, and the bond strength will be greater. (Incorrect)\nC. The bond length in Astratium will be shorter than in Silicon, and the bond strength will be weaker. (Incorrect)\nD. The bond length in Astratium will be longer than in Silicon, and the bond strength will be weaker. (Correct)\nE.

The functional form of the Morse potential is given by:\n$$U(r) = D_e \\left[ \\left(1 - \\exp(-a(r - r_e))\\right)^2 - 1 \\right]$$\nwhere $D_e$ is the bond dissociation energy (the depth of the potential well), $r_e$ is the equilibrium bond distance, and $a$ is a parameter that controls the width of the potential well.\n\nConsider two different carbon-carbon bonds, Bond 1 and Bond 2, described by the following two sets of Morse potential parameters:\n- **Parameter Set A:** $D_e = 6.31 \\text{ eV}$, $r_e = 1.34 \\text{ Angstroms}$, $a = 2.05 \\text{ Angstroms}^{-1}$\n- **Parameter Set B:** $D_e = 3.62 \\text{ eV}$, $r_e = 1.54 \\text{ Angstroms}$, $a = 1.83 \\text{ Angstroms}^{-1}$\n\nOne of these parameter sets corresponds to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C), and the other corresponds to a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). For small displacements from equilibrium, the bond can be modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator with an effective spring constant $k$, given by the second derivative of the potential energy evaluated at the equilibrium distance: $k = \\frac{d^2U}{dr^2}\\Big|_{r=r_e}$.\n\nAfter correctly identifying which parameter set describes the C=C double bond, calculate its effective spring constant $k$.

Thus it should have larger $D_{e}$, smaller $r_{e}$, and often larger $a$. Comparing the parameter sets: Set A has larger $D_{e}$, smaller $r_{e}$, and larger $a$ than Set B, so Set A corresponds to the C=C double bond.\n\nTo find the effective spring constant, define $x=r-r_{e}$ and $y=\\exp(-a x)$.
