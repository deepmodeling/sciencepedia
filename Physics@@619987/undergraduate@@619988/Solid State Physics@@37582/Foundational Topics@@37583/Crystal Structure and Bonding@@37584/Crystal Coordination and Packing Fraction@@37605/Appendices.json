The stability of a crystal lattice can often be predicted using a simple geometric model where ions are treated as hard, incompressible spheres. The coordination number, which is the number of nearest neighbors surrounding a central ion, is highly dependent on the relative sizes of the cation (positive ion) and the anion (negative ion). This relationship is quantified by the radius ratio.\n\nConsider an ionic crystal where a central cation of radius $r$ is in contact with a number of surrounding anions, each of radius $R$. One possible arrangement is a cubic coordination, where the cation is located at the center of a cube and is in contact with eight anions situated at the corners of that cube. For this configuration to be geometrically stable, the cation must be large enough to make contact with all eight anions. The limiting case for stability occurs when these anions, positioned at the cube's corners, are also just touching each other along the edges of the cube. If the cation were any smaller than this critical size, it would \"rattle\" within the cavity formed by the anions, leading to an unstable structure that would favor a lower coordination number.\n\nAssuming this hard-sphere model, calculate the critical radius ratio, $r/R$, which represents the minimum value for a stable cubic coordination geometry.
