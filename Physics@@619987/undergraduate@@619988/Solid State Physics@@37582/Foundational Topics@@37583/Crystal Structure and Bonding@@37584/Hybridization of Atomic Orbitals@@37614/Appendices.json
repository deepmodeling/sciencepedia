Applying mechanical strain to a silicon crystal lattice modifies its electronic band structure. In an unstrained silicon crystal, each silicon atom forms four covalent bonds with its neighbors in a perfect tetrahedral geometry. These bonds are described by four equivalent $sp^3$ hybrid atomic orbitals.\n\nConsider a single silicon atom in a crystal lattice that is subjected to a uniaxial strain. This strain distorts the local bonding environment, causing the angle between two of its Si-Si bonds, which we will label bond $i$ and bond $j$, to become $\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is not necessarily the ideal tetrahedral angle of $\\arccos(-1/3)$.\n\nThe hybrid atomic orbitals, $\\psi_i$ and $\\psi_j$, corresponding to these two bonds can be modeled as normalized linear combinations of one atomic s-orbital, $|s\\rangle$, and three atomic p-orbitals.

This is because atomic orbitals (like $s$ and $p$) mix to form a new set of degenerate hybrid orbitals that point towards the bonded atoms, maximizing orbital overlap and forming stronger bonds. The number and orientation of these hybrid orbitals must match the observed geometry.\n\nFirst, let's analyze hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN). The problem states that the structure is planar and that each atom (both boron and nitrogen) is bonded to three other atoms. A planar geometry where a central atom is bonded to three other atoms is known as trigonal planar geometry. To form three equivalent bonds in a plane, oriented at approximately $120^\\circ$ to each other, an atom must mix one $s$ orbital and two $p$ orbitals. This process results in three $sp^2$ hybrid orbitals. Therefore, for both the boron and the nitrogen atoms in h-BN to achieve the described trigonal planar bonding, they must both adopt $sp^2$ hybridization. The remaining unhybridized $p_z$ orbital on each atom is oriented perpendicular to the planar sheet and participates in pi-bonding, which contributes to the stability of the layered structure. For boron (3 valence electrons), all three valence electrons occupy the three $sp^2$ orbitals to form three sigma bonds. For nitrogen (5 valence electrons), three electrons occupy the $sp^2$ orbitals to form sigma bonds, and the remaining two electrons occupy the unhybridized $p_z$ orbital, participating in the delocalized pi system.\n\nNext, we analyze cubic Boron Nitride (c-BN). The problem describes a structure where each atom (both boron and nitrogen) is tetrahedrally coordinated, meaning it is bonded to four other atoms arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron. A tetrahedral geometry requires the central atom to form four equivalent bonds. This is achieved by mixing one $s$ orbital and three $p$ orbitals, which results in four equivalent $sp^3$ hybrid orbitals. These four orbitals are oriented towards the vertices of a tetrahedron, with bond angles of approximately $109.5^\\circ$. Since both boron and nitrogen atoms are described as being tetrahedrally coordinated, both must adopt $sp^3$ hybridization to form the network of four single bonds per atom.\n\nIn summary:\n- In h-BN, the planar, three-coordinate geometry dictates $sp^2$ hybridization for both B and N atoms.\n- In c-BN, the tetrahedral, four-coordinate geometry dictates $sp^3$ hybridization for both B and N atoms.\n\nComparing our findings with the given choices:\n- A.
