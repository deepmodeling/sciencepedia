This exercise challenges you to interpret XRD patterns, a fundamental skill for any materials scientist.

The XRD technique measures the intensity of scattered X-rays as a function of the scattering angle, denoted as $2\\theta$. The internal structure of the material—whether ordered or disordered—critically influences the resulting diffraction pattern. The samples are described as follows:\n\n- **Sample X:** A meticulously prepared, single-phase polymer that was crystallized very slowly from a dilute solution, resulting in a structure with high long-range molecular order.\n- **Sample Y:** A polymer that was melted and then subjected to an extremely rapid cooling process (quenching), trapping its molecules in a disordered, liquid-like arrangement.\n- **Sample Z:** A commercially available polymer thermoplastic, which, like most industrial polymers, was processed in a way that creates regions of ordered crystallites embedded within a matrix of disordered molecular chains.\n\nAfter performing the XRD experiments, the scientist obtains three distinct intensity patterns, described below:\n\n- **Pattern 1:** Shows several very sharp, narrow intensity peaks at specific, well-defined scattering angles. The intensity between these peaks is close to zero.\n- **Pattern 2:** Displays a single, very broad and smooth hump of intensity that extends over a wide range of scattering angles.

The fundamental principle of XRD is that X-rays are scattered by the electrons of atoms within a material. The resulting diffraction pattern is a map of the interference (constructive or destructive) of these scattered waves, which depends on the spatial arrangement of the atoms.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of a fully crystalline solid and its XRD pattern.**\nA crystalline solid is characterized by a long-range, periodic arrangement of its constituent atoms or molecules in a crystal lattice. When X-rays interact with this regular structure, constructive interference occurs only at specific angles that satisfy Bragg's Law, $n\\lambda = 2d\\sin\\theta$, where $d$ is the spacing between lattice planes. This highly specific condition for constructive interference results in a diffraction pattern with sharp, well-defined peaks (known as Bragg peaks) at distinct $2\\theta$ angles. Between these peaks, the interference is largely destructive, leading to very low intensity.\nSample X is described as having \"high long-range molecular order,\" which is the definition of a crystalline material.\nPattern 1 is described as having \"several very sharp, narrow intensity peaks,\" which is the signature of a crystalline solid.\nTherefore, Sample X corresponds to Pattern 1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of a fully amorphous solid and its XRD pattern.**\nAn amorphous solid lacks long-range periodic order. The atoms or molecules are arranged randomly, similar to a frozen liquid. However, there is still short-range order, meaning a characteristic average distance exists between neighboring molecules. This short-range order leads to constructive interference over a broad range of angles, rather than at specific discrete angles. The result is a diffraction pattern that features one or more broad, diffuse \"halos\" or \"humps\" instead of sharp peaks.\nSample Y is described as having a \"disordered, liquid-like arrangement,\" which is the definition of an amorphous material.\nPattern 2 is described as a \"single, very broad and smooth hump of intensity,\" which is the signature of an amorphous solid.\nTherefore, Sample Y corresponds to Pattern 2.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of a semi-crystalline solid and its XRD pattern.**\nA semi-crystalline solid, as the name suggests, is a mixture of both crystalline and amorphous phases. It contains small, ordered crystalline regions (crystallites) embedded within a disordered amorphous matrix. Since XRD is a bulk characterization technique, the resulting diffraction pattern is a superposition of the signals from both phases. We would expect to see the sharp Bragg peaks characteristic of the crystalline regions superimposed on the broad, diffuse halo characteristic of the amorphous regions.\nSample Z is described as having \"regions of ordered crystallites embedded within a matrix of disordered molecular chains,\" which is the definition of a semi-crystalline material.\nPattern 3 is described as a \"composite structure, with a few sharp, narrow peaks... on top of a broad, underlying hump,\" which is the signature of a semi-crystalline solid.\nTherefore, Sample Z corresponds to Pattern 3.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the matching.**\nBased on the analysis in the previous steps, the correct pairings are:\n- Sample X (crystalline) → Pattern 1 (sharp peaks)\n- Sample Y (amorphous) → Pattern 2 (broad hump)\n- Sample Z (semi-crystalline) → Pattern 3 (sharp peaks on a broad hump)\n\nThis set of matches corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1767163"}, {"introduction": "A material's atomic arrangement profoundly affects its thermodynamic properties, a difference that becomes clear when tracking its volume during cooling.

Network-forming oxides are particularly adept at vitrification. In 1932, W. H. Zachariasen proposed a set of empirical rules to predict whether a given oxide, with the general formula $A_m O_n$, is likely to be a glass former.\n\nZachariasen's rules for an oxide to form a glass are as follows:\n1. An oxygen atom must be linked to no more than two of the main structural cations, $A$.\n2. The coordination number of cation $A$ with respect to oxygen must be small, typically 3 or 4.\n3.
