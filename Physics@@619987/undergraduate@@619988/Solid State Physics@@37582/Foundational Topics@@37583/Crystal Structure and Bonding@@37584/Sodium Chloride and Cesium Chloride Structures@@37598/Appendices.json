This structure can be described as a simple cubic lattice with a two-ion basis. The anions (X) are located at the corners of the cube (e.g., position (0,0,0)), and the cation (M) is located at the body center of the cube (position (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) in fractional coordinates).\n\nThe ions are modeled as hard, incompressible spheres.

So, there is 1 cation.\nThe anions (X) are at the 8 corners of the cube. Each corner ion is shared by 8 adjacent unit cells. Therefore, the total number of anions per unit cell is $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$.\nSo, one unit cell contains one cation and one anion.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the lattice parameter `a` to the ionic radii.**\nThe first geometric condition is that the cation and anion touch along the body diagonal of the cube. The length of the body diagonal is $\\sqrt{3}a$. The distance from a corner to the body center is half of this length, $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{2}$. This distance is spanned by the radius of the corner anion ($r_a$) and the radius of the central cation ($r_c$).\nTherefore, the contact condition gives:\n$$r_a + r_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{2}$$\nWe can express the lattice parameter $a$ in terms of the radii:\n$$a = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}(r_a + r_c)$$\nUsing the radius ratio $\\gamma = r_c/r_a$, we can write $r_c = \\gamma r_a$.

Per the problem statement, $r_c \\le r_a$. Dividing by $r_a$ (which is positive) gives $\\gamma \\le 1$. This is the upper bound of the domain.\n2.  The second geometric condition is that adjacent anions do not overlap. The closest distance between the centers of two corner anions is the lattice parameter $a$. Since they are modeled as hard spheres of radius $r_a$, their centers must be separated by at least $2r_a$. Thus, $a \\ge 2r_a$.\nSubstituting our expression for $a$:\n$$\\frac{2r_a(1 + \\gamma)}{\\sqrt{3}} \\ge 2r_a$$\n$$ \\frac{1 + \\gamma}{\\sqrt{3}} \\ge 1 \\implies 1 + \\gamma \\ge \\sqrt{3} \\implies \\gamma \\ge \\sqrt{3} - 1$$\nThis provides the lower bound. Combining the bounds, the valid domain for the radius ratio is $\\gamma \\in [\\sqrt{3}-1, 1]$.\n\n**Step 7: Find the value of `γ` that maximizes `f(γ)`.**\nTo find the maximum of $f(\\gamma)$, we first analyze its derivative with respect to $\\gamma$.\nLet $C = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Then $f(\\gamma) = C \\frac{1 + \\gamma^3}{(1 + \\gamma)^3}$.\nWe use the quotient rule for the derivative of the $\\gamma$-dependent part:\n$$f'(\\gamma) = C \\frac{[3\\gamma^2](1+\\gamma)^3 - (1+\\gamma^3)[3(1+\\gamma)^2]}{(1+\\gamma)^6}$$\n$$f'(\\gamma) = C \\frac{3(1+\\gamma)^2[\\gamma^2(1+\\gamma) - (1+\\gamma^3)]}{(1+\\gamma)^6}$$\n$$f'(\\gamma) = 3C \\frac{\\gamma^2 + \\gamma^3 - 1 - \\gamma^3}{(1+\\gamma)^4} = 3C \\frac{\\gamma^2 - 1}{(1+\\gamma)^4}$$\nThe sign of the derivative is determined by the term $(\\gamma^2 - 1)$.\nThe domain of interest is $\\gamma \\in [\\sqrt{3}-1, 1]$.\nFor any $\\gamma$ in the interior of this domain, i.e., $\\sqrt{3}-1 < \\gamma < 1$, we have $\\gamma^2 < 1$. Thus, $\\gamma^2 - 1 < 0$, which means $f'(\\gamma) < 0$.\nAt the boundary $\\gamma=1$, $f'(\\gamma)=0$.\nSince the derivative is negative throughout the interior of the domain, the function $f(\\gamma)$ is strictly decreasing on the interval $[\\sqrt{3}-1, 1]$.\nFor a monotonically decreasing function, the maximum value must occur at the leftmost point of its domain. Therefore, the packing fraction is maximized at $\\gamma_{opt} = \\sqrt{3}-1$.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the maximum packing fraction `f_{max}`.**\nWe evaluate $f(\\gamma)$ at $\\gamma_{opt} = \\sqrt{3}-1$.\n$$f_{max} = f(\\sqrt{3}-1) = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\frac{1 + (\\sqrt{3}-1)^3}{(1 + (\\sqrt{3}-1))^3} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\frac{1 + (\\sqrt{3}-1)^3}{(\\sqrt{3})^3}$$\nFirst, let's expand $(\\sqrt{3}-1)^3$:\n$$(\\sqrt{3}-1)^3 = (\\sqrt{3})^3 - 3(\\sqrt{3})^2(1) + 3(\\sqrt{3})(1)^2 - (1)^3 = 3\\sqrt{3} - 9 + 3\\sqrt{3} - 1 = 6\\sqrt{3}-10$$\nNow substitute this back into the expression for $f_{max}$:\n$$f_{max} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\frac{1 + (6\\sqrt{3}-10)}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\frac{6\\sqrt{3}-9}{3\\sqrt{3}}$$\nFactor out 3 from the numerator:\n$$f_{max} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\frac{3(2\\sqrt{3}-3)}{3\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(2\\sqrt{3}-3)$$\n\n**Step 9: Compute the numerical values.**\nWe need to find the numerical values for $\\gamma_{opt}$ and $f_{max}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\gamma_{opt} = \\sqrt{3}-1 \\approx 1.7320508... - 1 = 0.7320508...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\gamma_{opt} \\approx 0.7321$.\n$$f_{max} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(2\\sqrt{3}-3) \\approx \\frac{3.1415926}{2}(2 \\times 1.7320508 - 3) = 1.5707963(3.4641016 - 3) = 1.5707963 \\times 0.4641016 \\approx 0.728956...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_{max} \\approx 0.7290$.\n\nThe pair of values is $(\\gamma_{opt}, f_{max}) = (0.7321, 0.7290)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.7321 & 0.7290 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1802324"}]}
