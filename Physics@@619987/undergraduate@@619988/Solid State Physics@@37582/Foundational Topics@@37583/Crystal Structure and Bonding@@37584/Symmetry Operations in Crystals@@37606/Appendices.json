The point group is precisely $C_{2}$.\n\nOption E: Single atom $r=(\\frac{a}{4},\\frac{a}{3})$.\n- $C_{2}$ about $C$ would require $g_{2C}(r)=(a,a)-r=(\\frac{3a}{4},\\frac{2a}{3})$ to be congruent to $r$ modulo a lattice vector, i.e., $(\\frac{3}{4},\\frac{2}{3})\\equiv(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{3})$ modulo integers, which is false. About $O$, we would need $-r=r+t$ for some $t\\in L$, i.e., $2r\\in L$, but $2r=(\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{2a}{3})\\notin L$. Hence no $C_{2}$ remains. Generic coordinates also break all mirrors. Thus the point group is $C_{1}$.\n\nConclusion: Only Option D yields a decorated structure whose point group is exactly $C_{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1807431"}]}
