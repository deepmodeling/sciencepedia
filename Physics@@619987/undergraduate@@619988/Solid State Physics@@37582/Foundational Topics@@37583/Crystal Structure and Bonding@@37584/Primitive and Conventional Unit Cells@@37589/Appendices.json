Moreover, every lattice point must have an identical environment, i.e., all points are equivalent under lattice translations.\n\nStep 1: Show $S$ is not closed under the translations implied by including both corners and edge centers.\n- Since $(0,0,0)\\in S$ (a corner) and $(\\tfrac{1}{2}a,0,0)\\in S$ (an x-edge center), their difference\n$$\n\\mathbf{t}_{x}=(\\tfrac{1}{2}a,0,0)\n$$\nmust be a lattice vector if $S$ were a Bravais lattice.\n- Since $(0,0,0)\\in S$ and $(0,\\tfrac{1}{2}a,0)\\in S$ (a y-edge center), their difference\n$$\n\\mathbf{t}_{y}=(0,\\tfrac{1}{2}a,0)\n$$\nmust also be a lattice vector if $S$ were a Bravais lattice.\n- In any Bravais lattice, the sum of lattice vectors is a lattice vector, so\n$$\n\\mathbf{t}_{x}+\\mathbf{t}_{y}=(\\tfrac{1}{2}a,\\tfrac{1}{2}a,0)\n$$\nwould have to be a lattice vector.

This contradiction shows $S$ cannot be a Bravais lattice.\n\nStep 2: Confirm non-equivalence of environments as an independent check.\n- Consider the corner point $\\mathbf{C}=(0,0,0)$. Its nearest points in $S$ are the three adjacent edge centers $(\\tfrac{1}{2}a,0,0)$, $(0,\\tfrac{1}{2}a,0)$, $(0,0,\\tfrac{1}{2}a)$, each at distance $a/2$. Thus the corner has $3$ nearest neighbors at distance $a/2$.\n- Consider the edge-center point $\\mathbf{E}=(\\tfrac{1}{2}a,0,0)$. Its nearest points in $S$ at distance $a/2$ are the two corners $(0,0,0)$ and $(a,0,0)$ lying at the ends of the edge. Thus the edge center has $2$ nearest neighbors at distance $a/2$.\n- Since the local environments differ (multiplicity of nearest neighbors at the shortest distance is $3$ versus $2$), not all points are equivalent. This violates the defining property of a Bravais lattice.\n\nStep 3: Exclude equivalence to standard cubic Bravais lattices.\n- FCC contains face centers such as $(\\tfrac{1}{2}a,\\tfrac{1}{2}a,0)$, which $S$ lacks; hence $S$ is not FCC.\n- BCC contains body centers such as $(\\tfrac{1}{2}a,\\tfrac{1}{2}a,\\tfrac{1}{2}a)$, which $S$ lacks; hence $S$ is not BCC.\n- SC with lattice constant $a/2$ contains all points with coordinates in $\\tfrac{a}{2}\\mathbb{Z}$, including face centers and body centers, which $S$ lacks; hence $S$ is not SC with lattice constant $a/2$.\n\nTherefore, the ECC arrangement does not form a Bravais lattice because it fails both closure under the required lattice translations and the requirement that all lattice points have identical environments.
