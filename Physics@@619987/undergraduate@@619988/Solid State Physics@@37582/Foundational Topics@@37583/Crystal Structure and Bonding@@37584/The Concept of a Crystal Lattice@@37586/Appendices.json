In the idealized model of a crystal, atoms are considered hard spheres packed together as efficiently as possible. This practice challenges you to apply three-dimensional geometry to one such arrangement, the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure, to derive its theoretical $c/a$ ratio. This calculation reveals a fundamental constant born from pure geometry, providing a benchmark for comparing ideal structures with real materials [@problem_id:1811362].", "problem": "In solid-state physics, the arrangement of atoms in a crystal is often modeled by the stacking of identical, impenetrable hard spheres. One of the most common and efficient packing arrangements is the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure. This structure is built by stacking two-dimensional close-packed layers of spheres in an alternating sequence, commonly denoted as ABAB.... The first layer (A) is a hexagonal arrangement of spheres. The second layer (B) is identical to the first but is shifted so that its spheres rest in the depressions between the spheres of layer A. The third layer is placed such that its spheres are directly above the spheres of layer A, creating the repeating ABAB... pattern.\n\nThe conventional unit cell used to describe the HCP structure is a right prism with a hexagonal base.

The parameter $a$ is the distance between the centers of any two adjacent spheres within the same basal plane (e.g., within layer A).\n2.

Many important materials, including graphene, are described by a 'lattice with a basis,' where a small group of atoms is repeated at each point of an underlying Bravais lattice. This exercise uses the 2D honeycomb lattice to explore this vital concept, forcing a deeper look at what constitutes a primitive unit cell. Correctly identifying the number of atoms in this fundamental repeating unit is key to understanding the electronic and vibrational properties of such materials [@problem_id:1811353].", "problem": "Graphene is a remarkable material consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb pattern. This structure can be visualized as a repeating array of regular hexagons, with a carbon atom situated at each vertex. A fundamental concept for describing such periodic structures is the **primitive unit cell**. A primitive unit cell is a region of space (in this case, an area) that, when translated by a specific set of vectors, can perfectly tile the entire structure without any overlaps or gaps. It is the smallest possible repeating unit that captures the full symmetry of the lattice.\n\nGiven this description of the graphene lattice, determine the exact number of carbon atoms contained within a single primitive unit cell.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of atoms in a primitive unit cell of a 2D honeycomb lattice. A common mistake is to assume the hexagon is the unit cell, or that the answer is simply one. A careful analysis is required.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the honeycomb lattice. A key property of a true crystal lattice, known as a Bravais lattice, is that every lattice point has an identical environment. If we pick any atom in the honeycomb structure and look at its three nearest neighbors, the bonds to these neighbors have a specific orientation. For example, one bond might point vertically upwards, and the other two might point downwards to the left and right. If we then move to one of those neighbors and examine its environment, we find that its bonds have a different orientation (e.g., one bond pointing vertically downwards and two pointing upwards to the left and right). Since the environment is not identical for every atom, the honeycomb structure itself is **not** a Bravais lattice.\n\nInstead, the honeycomb lattice must be described as a **Bravais lattice with a basis**. This means we can define an underlying lattice of points that *are* all equivalent (the Bravais lattice), and then place an identical group of atoms (the basis) at each of these lattice points to construct the full honeycomb structure.\n\nLet's identify the two distinct types of atomic sites, which we can label 'A' and 'B'. All 'A' sites are equivalent to each other, and all 'B' sites are equivalent to each other, but an 'A' site is not equivalent to a 'B' site due to the different orientation of the surrounding bonds. The set of all 'A' sites forms a Bravais lattice, and the set of all 'B' sites forms an identical, but shifted, Bravais lattice.\n\nWe can choose the Bravais lattice to be the set of points corresponding to the 'A' atoms. This forms a 2D hexagonal lattice. To generate the complete honeycomb structure from this lattice, we need to associate a basis with each lattice point. The basis must contain one 'A' atom (which sits on the lattice point) and one 'B' atom (which is displaced by a short distance, equal to the carbon-carbon bond length). Therefore, the basis for the honeycomb lattice consists of **two atoms**.\n\nBy definition, a primitive unit cell of a crystal structure contains exactly one point of the underlying Bravais lattice and the complete basis associated with that point. Since the basis for the honeycomb lattice contains two atoms, the number of atoms in a primitive unit cell must be two.\n\n**Alternative Geometric Counting Method:**\n\nWe can also arrive at this conclusion by explicitly constructing a primitive unit cell and counting the atoms within it. A primitive unit cell for the underlying hexagonal Bravais lattice (e.g., the lattice of 'A' atoms) is a rhombus. This rhombus is defined by two primitive lattice vectors, $\\vec{a}_1$ and $\\vec{a}_2$, which connect an 'A' atom to two of its non-adjacent, same-type neighbors.\n\nLet's place the vertices of this rhombus on four 'A' atoms.\n- There is one 'A' atom at each of the four corners of the rhombus.\n- In a 2D lattice, an atom at a corner of a unit cell is shared by four adjacent cells.\n- So, the total number of 'A' atoms belonging to this single unit cell is $4 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n\nNow, we must consider the 'B' atoms. The geometry of the honeycomb structure is such that inside this rhombus-shaped primitive cell, there is exactly one 'B' atom located entirely within the cell's boundaries. This 'B' atom is not shared with any other cell.\n- The total number of 'B' atoms belonging to this single unit cell is $1$.\n\nThe total number of atoms in the primitive unit cell is the sum of the 'A' and 'B' atoms it contains.\nTotal atoms = (Number of 'A' atoms) + (Number of 'B' atoms) = $1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nBoth methods consistently show that there are two atoms per primitive unit cell in a honeycomb lattice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1811353"}]}
