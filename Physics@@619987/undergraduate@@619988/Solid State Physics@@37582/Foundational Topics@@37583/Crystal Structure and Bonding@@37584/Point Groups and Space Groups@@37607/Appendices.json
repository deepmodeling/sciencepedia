Powers give $C_{3}$ and $C_{2}$ about the same axis.\n\n2. Vertical mirror planes: There are planes containing the principal axis that reflect the prism onto itself.

Twofold axes perpendicular to the principal axis: In the midplane equidistant between the top and bottom faces, there are $6$ distinct $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to the principal axis, aligned along directions connecting opposite vertices and midpoints of opposite edges of the hexagon. A rotation by $\\pi$ about any such horizontal axis interchanges the top and bottom faces and permutes side faces, leaving the prism invariant.\n\n4. Horizontal mirror plane: The plane midway between the top and bottom faces is a mirror plane, so the object has a horizontal mirror $\\sigma_{h}$.\n\n5.

This problem explores the deep connection between a crystal's point group and its potential to exhibit piezoelectricity, governed by Neumann's Principle. By evaluating the necessary and sufficient conditions for this property, you will learn how abstract symmetry rules provide powerful, practical constraints on the behavior of materials [@problem_id:1797781].", "problem": "Piezoelectricity is a property of certain crystalline materials where an applied mechanical stress, $\\sigma$, induces an electric polarization, $P$. This linear relationship is described by a third-rank tensor. A fundamental guiding principle in materials science is Neumann's Principle, which states that the physical properties of a crystal must possess at least the symmetry of the crystal's point group. There are 32 crystallographic point groups that describe the macroscopic symmetry of any crystal. A direct consequence of Neumann's Principle is that any crystal whose point group includes a center of inversion symmetry cannot be piezoelectric.\n\nA materials scientist proposes the following working hypothesis: \"A crystal is guaranteed to be piezoelectric if and only if its point group is non-centrosymmetric (i.e., lacks a center of inversion).\"\n\nEvaluate this hypothesis. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate assessment?\n\nA. The proposed rule is correct. The absence of an inversion center is both a necessary and sufficient condition for a material to exhibit piezoelectricity. Any non-centrosymmetric crystal structure will, by definition, produce a net polarization under stress.\n\nB. The proposed rule is incorrect. A crystal must not only lack an inversion center but also must be polar, meaning it has a unique vector direction that is not repeated by any symmetry operation. All non-polar, non-centrosymmetric groups are not piezoelectric.\n\nC. The proposed rule is incorrect. While being non-centrosymmetric is a necessary condition for piezoelectricity, it is not sufficient. There exists at least one non-centrosymmetric point group, the cubic group 432, which is forbidden by symmetry to have any non-zero piezoelectric coefficients.\n\nD. The proposed rule is correct, but only for non-cubic crystal systems. All non-centrosymmetric point groups in the trigonal, hexagonal, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic systems are piezoelectric. For the cubic system, however, the high degree of symmetry always forbids piezoelectricity.\n\nE. The proposed rule is a good heuristic but is fundamentally incomplete. The presence or absence of piezoelectricity cannot be determined from classical symmetry arguments alone. A full quantum mechanical calculation of the electronic band structure's response to lattice strain is required to determine if a non-centrosymmetric material is piezoelectric.", "solution": "Piezoelectricity in the linear regime is described by the constitutive relation\n$$\nP_{i} = d_{ijk}\\,\\sigma_{jk},\n$$\nwhere $P_{i}$ is a polar vector (electric polarization), $\\sigma_{jk}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor, and $d_{ijk}$ is a third-rank polar tensor. Because $\\sigma_{jk}$ is symmetric, the piezoelectric tensor obeys\n$$\nd_{ijk} = d_{ikj}.\n$$\n\nBy Neumann’s principle, the tensor $d_{ijk}$ must be invariant under all symmetry operations of the crystal’s point group. Under a point-group operation represented by an orthogonal matrix $R$, a third-rank polar tensor transforms as\n$$\nd'_{ijk} = R_{ii'}\\,R_{jj'}\\,R_{kk'}\\,d_{i'j'k'}.\n$$\nInvariance requires $d'_{ijk} = d_{ijk}$ for every operation in the point group.\n\nFirst, consider any centrosymmetric point group, which contains inversion $\\mathcal{I}$ with $R = -I$. Using the transformation rule,\n$$\nd'_{ijk} = (-1)\\,(-1)\\,(-1)\\,d_{ijk} = -d_{ijk}.\n$$\nInvariance $d'_{ijk} = d_{ijk}$ then forces\n$$\nd_{ijk} = -d_{ijk} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d_{ijk} = 0.\n$$\nThus, the presence of an inversion center forbids piezoelectricity. Therefore, non-centrosymmetry is a necessary condition for piezoelectricity.\n\nNext, assess whether non-centrosymmetry is sufficient. Consider the non-centrosymmetric cubic point group $432$. Invariance under all proper cubic rotations constrains $d_{ijk}$ to be an isotropic third-rank polar tensor. The only isotropic third-rank tensors are proportional to the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ and the zero tensor. However, $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is totally antisymmetric, while $d_{ijk}$ must be symmetric in the last two indices ($j,k$) because $\\sigma_{jk}$ is symmetric. Consequently,\n$$\nd_{ijk} \\propto \\epsilon_{ijk} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad d_{ijk}\\,\\sigma_{jk} = 0,\n$$\nsince contraction of an antisymmetric pair with a symmetric tensor vanishes. Hence all components of $d_{ijk}$ are forced to zero in $432$, and the group $432$ is non-centrosymmetric yet non-piezoelectric. This shows that non-centrosymmetry is not sufficient.\n\nThis directly falsifies the “if and only if” part of the proposed hypothesis. Furthermore, several non-centrosymmetric cubic point groups (e.g., $23$ and $\\bar{4}3m$) do permit nonzero $d_{ijk}$ and are piezoelectric, so it is not true that all cubic groups forbid piezoelectricity. It is also false that a group must be polar to be piezoelectric: many nonpolar, non-centrosymmetric groups are piezoelectric (the unique exception among non-centrosymmetric point groups is $432$). Finally, group-theoretical symmetry arguments alone are sufficient to determine whether $d_{ijk}$ can be nonzero; a full quantum calculation is not required for this determination.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate assessment is that non-centrosymmetry is necessary but not sufficient, with $432$ providing the explicit counterexample.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1797781"}]}
