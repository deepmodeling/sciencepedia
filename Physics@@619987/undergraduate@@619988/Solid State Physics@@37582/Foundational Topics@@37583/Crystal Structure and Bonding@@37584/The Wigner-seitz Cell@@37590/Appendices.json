This concept can be generalized to describe systems with modulated properties.\n\nConsider a one-dimensional infinite lattice of 'sites' located at positions $x_n = n \\cdot a$, where $n$ is any integer and $a$ is a constant distance. This lattice exhibits a periodic modulation such that sites at even integer positions of $n$ (i.e., $n=0, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\dots$) have a characteristic 'weight' $W_A$, while sites at odd integer positions of $n$ (i.e., $n=\\pm 1, \\pm 3, \\dots$) have a different weight $W_B$. We assume both $W_A$ and $W_B$ are positive real constants.\n\nThe space is partitioned into cells based on a weighted-distance rule. The cell associated with a site $x_n$ consists of all points $x$ on the line that are 'closer' to $x_n$ than to any other site $x_m$. The weighted distance, or 'affinity', between a point $x$ and a site $x_n$ with weight $W_n$ is defined as $A(x, x_n) = \\frac{|x - x_n|}{W_n}$. A point $x$ belongs to the cell of site $x_n$ if $A(x, x_n) \\leq A(x, x_m)$ for all integers $m \\neq n$.\n\nThis system has a repeating structural unit. Due to the periodic nature of the weights, all cells associated with sites of weight $W_A$ have the same length, which we denote as $L_A$. Similarly, all cells associated with sites of weight $W_B$ have a uniform length $L_B$.\n\nDetermine the ratio $\\frac{L_A}{L_B}$ in terms of the weights $W_A$ and $W_B$.", "solution": "We have sites at $x_{n}=n a$ with weights alternating as $W_{A}$ for even $n$ and $W_{B}$ for odd $n$. The weighted affinity is $A(x,x_{n})=\\frac{|x-x_{n}|}{W_{n}}$. In one dimension, for a given site, its Voronoi cell boundaries are determined by equating the weighted distances to its immediate neighbors, because for any $x$ between two adjacent sites, the Euclidean distances to non-adjacent sites are strictly larger and the weights are positive constants, so the minimum of $\\frac{|x-x_{m}|}{W_{m}}$ among $m$ will be achieved by one of the adjacent neighbors.\n\nConsider the site at $x=0$ (type $A$ with weight $W_{A}$) and its right neighbor at $x=a$ (type $B$ with weight $W_{B}$).

The Wigner-Seitz cell is the smallest enclosed volume (area in 2D) around the origin bounded by these bisector lines. The shape of the cell is determined by the bisectors of the nearest neighbors to the origin.\n\nFirst, let's identify the positions of the lattice points closest to the origin $(0,0)$ and calculate their squared distances. The general positions are $\\vec{R} = (m a, n b)$ and $\\vec{R}' = ((m+1/2)a, (n+1/2)b)$ for integers $m, n$. We are looking for the points with the smallest non-zero squared distance $d^2 = x^2+y^2$.\n\nLet's list the candidates for the nearest neighbors:\n1.  **Centered points**: The closest points from the second set are for $n_1, n_2 = 0, -1$. For example, with $(n_1, n_2) = (0,0), (-1,0), (0,-1), (-1,-1)$ in the definition $\\vec{R}'$, we get the four points $(\\pm a/2, \\pm b/2)$.\n    The squared distance to these points is $d_C^2 = (a/2)^2 + (b/2)^2 = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\n\n2.  **Conventional cell vertices**: The closest points from the first set are for $(n_1, n_2) = (\\pm 1, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm 1)$.\n    The squared distance to the points $(\\pm a, 0)$ is $d_a^2 = a^2$.\n    The squared distance to the points $(0, \\pm b)$ is $d_b^2 = b^2$.\n\nNow, we use the specific condition given in the problem: $b = \\sqrt{3} a$. Let's substitute this into the squared distance expressions to find the true nearest neighbors.\n\nFor the centered points:\n$$d_C^2 = \\frac{a^2 + (\\sqrt{3}a)^2}{4} = \\frac{a^2 + 3a^2}{4} = \\frac{4a^2}{4} = a^2$$\n\nFor the points on the x-axis:\n$$d_a^2 = a^2$$\n\nFor the points on the y-axis:\n$$d_b^2 = b^2 = (\\sqrt{3}a)^2 = 3a^2$$\n\nComparing these squared distances, we find that $d_C^2 = d_a^2 = a^2$, and $d_b^2 = 3a^2$.\nThe smallest squared distance is $a^2$. This means that for the specific ratio $b=\\sqrt{3}a$, there are two sets of nearest neighbors at the same distance $d=a$:\n- The four centered points at $(\\pm a/2, \\pm b/2) = (\\pm a/2, \\pm \\sqrt{3}a/2)$.\n- The two points on the x-axis at $(\\pm a, 0)$.\n\nIn total, there are six nearest neighbors. The Wigner-Seitz cell will be bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors to these six points. Since there are six nearest neighbors whose bisectors form the boundaries of the resulting polygon, the Wigner-Seitz cell must have six sides.\n\nLet's verify this by looking at the bisectors.\n-   **Bisectors for $(\\pm a, 0)$**: The vectors are $\\vec{R} = \\pm a\\hat{x}$. The perpendicular bisectors are the vertical lines $x = \\pm a/2$.\n\n-   **Bisectors for $(\\pm a/2, \\pm b/2)$**: Let's take the neighbor at $(a/2, b/2)$.
