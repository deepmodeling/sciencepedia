Let's establish the mathematical relationship between $\\theta$ and the radial distance on the projection.\n\nWe can analyze the geometry in a 2D cross-section of the reference sphere without loss of generality, as the radial distance is independent of the azimuthal angle $\\phi$. Let the reference sphere have a radius $R$ and be centered at the origin $(0,0)$. The projection plane is the line $z=0$ (the x-axis in our 2D view). The projection is from the South Pole, $S$, located at $(0, -R)$. The North Pole is at $(0, R)$. The polar angle $\\theta$ is measured from the z-axis (the [001] direction). A crystallographic direction corresponds to a point $P$ on the upper hemisphere of the sphere.

Hence, the highest-order rotational symmetry of the projected pattern equals the highest-order rotational symmetry of the set $S$ under rotations about the chosen projection axis.\n\nScenario A: (001) projection with [001] as the projection center. Consider rotations about the $[001]$ axis (the $z$-axis). The rotation by angle $\\theta$ about $[001]$ acts on $(x,y,z)$ as\n$$\nR_{[001]}(\\theta):(x,y,z)\\mapsto (x\\cos\\theta - y\\sin\\theta,\\; x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta,\\; z).\n$$\nApplying $R_{[001]}(\\pi/2)$ gives\n$$\nR_{[001]}(\\pi/2)[100]=(0,1,0)=[010],\\quad R_{[001]}(\\pi/2)[010]=(-1,0,0)=[\\bar{1}00],\n$$\nand similarly cycles $\\pm \\hat{x}$ and $\\pm \\hat{y}$ while leaving $\\pm \\hat{z}$ invariant as lines. Thus $S$ is invariant under $90^{\\circ}$ rotations about $[001]$, so a $4$-fold rotational symmetry exists.

A proper rotation about $[111]$ that leaves the axis invariant and cycles the Cartesian axes is given by the linear map\n$$\nP:(x,y,z)\\mapsto (z,x,y),\\qquad P=\\begin{pmatrix}0  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis $P$ is orthogonal with determinant $1$, fixes $(1,1,1)$ up to scale, and satisfies $P^{3}=I$, so it is a rotation by $2\\pi/3$ about $[111]$. Its action permutes the set $S$:\n$$\nP[100]=[001],\\quad P[010]=[100],\\quad P[001]=[010],\n$$\nand likewise on the negatives, so $S$ is invariant under $120^{\\circ}$ rotations about $[111]$. Hence a $3$-fold rotational symmetry exists. There is no $6$-fold rotational symmetry about $[111]$ in the cubic point group: any rotation about $[111]$ that maps coordinate axes to coordinate axes must be a permutation of $\\{\\pm \\hat{x},\\pm \\hat{y},\\pm \\hat{z}\\}$ preserving the direction of $(1,1,1)$, which restricts to the $3$-cycle and its square; no $60^{\\circ}$ rotation achieves this.

While a stereogram provides a rich visualization of a crystal's macroscopic symmetries (its point group), it does not capture all crystallographic information. This final exercise [@problem_id:1805553] is a conceptual check that probes this distinction, asking why a stereogram alone cannot distinguish between different Bravais lattices like primitive, body-centered, or face-centered cubic.", "problem": "An undergraduate researcher is characterizing a newly synthesized metallic crystal. Through a series of crystallographic experiments, the researcher successfully identifies all the macroscopic rotational and reflectional symmetry elements of the crystal. To visualize these symmetries, they create a stereographic projection, which is a two-dimensional map of the crystal's symmetry directions. The resulting stereogram clearly corresponds to the cubic point group $m\\bar{3}m$, which possesses the highest degree of symmetry within the cubic crystal system.\n\nBased on this finding, the researcher concludes that the crystal must have a primitive cubic (P) Bravais lattice. Their reasoning is that since their analysis reveals the fundamental cubic symmetries, the underlying lattice must be the simplest possible cubic form, which is the primitive lattice.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct and most fundamental reason why the researcher's conclusion is not necessarily valid?\n\nA. The researcher made a mistake; the point group $m\\bar{3}m$ is only found in the face-centered cubic lattice, not the primitive or body-centered lattices.\n\nB. A stereographic projection displays the point group symmetry of a crystal, which is determined by its macroscopic symmetry operations. This information alone is insufficient because the distinction between primitive (P), body-centered (I), and face-centered (F) Bravais lattices depends on translational symmetry, which is not represented in a point group stereogram.\n\nC. The stereogram for a body-centered cubic lattice would show additional symmetry poles corresponding to the directions connecting a corner atom to the body-center atom, which the researcher must have missed.\n\nD. The researcher's conclusion is flawed because primitive cubic lattices are extremely rare in naturally occurring and synthesized materials, making it statistically much more likely that the crystal is body-centered or face-centered.\n\nE. The point group $m\\bar{3}m$ requires the presence of an inversion center, but primitive cubic lattices are by definition non-centrosymmetric.", "solution": "We analyze what information a stereographic projection conveys and how Bravais lattice types are defined.\n\nFirst, a stereographic projection of a crystal’s symmetry elements displays the orientations of rotational axes, mirror planes, and inversion centers. These are the macroscopic symmetry operations of the crystal’s point group. By definition, a point group consists only of operations that leave at least one point fixed (rotations, reflections, rotoinversions, inversion), and it explicitly excludes any translational components. Therefore, a stereogram encodes only point-group symmetry.\n\nSecond, the distinction among primitive (P), body-centered (I), and face-centered (F) Bravais lattices is a property of the translational lattice. In a cubic setting, these are distinguished by the presence or absence of centering translations. Writing lattice vectors in fractional coordinates relative to the conventional cubic cell, the centering translations are:\n$$\n\\text{P: } \\{(0,0,0)\\}, \\quad\n\\text{I: } \\{(0,0,0), \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\}, \\quad\n\\text{F: } \\{(0,0,0), \\left(0,\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right), \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},0,\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right), \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},0\\right)\\}.\n$$\nThese are translational symmetry elements, which do not appear in a point group and therefore cannot be determined from a stereographic projection of point-group symmetry.\n\nThird, the cubic holohedry $m\\overline{3}m$ is compatible with multiple Bravais lattice centerings, giving rise to multiple space groups that share the same point group but differ in translational symmetry. Canonical examples include $Pm\\overline{3}m$ (primitive), $Im\\overline{3}m$ (body-centered), and $Fm\\overline{3}m$ (face-centered). Hence, determining that the point group is $m\\overline{3}m$ does not specify whether the Bravais lattice is P, I, or F.\n\nTherefore, the researcher’s conclusion is not necessarily valid because the stereogram alone lacks the translational information needed to distinguish P, I, and F. This corresponds precisely to option B. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: A is false since $m\\overline{3}m$ occurs with P, I, and F centerings; C incorrectly assumes translational features appear as additional point-group symmetry poles; D is a non-fundamental statistical argument, not a symmetry reason; E is false because primitive cubic can be centrosymmetric (e.g., $Pm\\overline{3}m$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1805553"}]}
