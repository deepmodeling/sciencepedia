Sphere A is brought into contact with sphere B. After a brief moment allowing for charge redistribution, they are separated.\n2.  Following the first operation, sphere B is then brought into contact with sphere C. Again, they are allowed to reach equilibrium before being separated.\n3.  Finally, after the second operation is complete, sphere C is briefly connected to the Earth using a thin conducting wire, which is then removed.\n\nThroughout the experiment, the spheres are handled with insulating rods, and when not in contact, they are kept far enough apart that any electrostatic induction effects between them are negligible.
