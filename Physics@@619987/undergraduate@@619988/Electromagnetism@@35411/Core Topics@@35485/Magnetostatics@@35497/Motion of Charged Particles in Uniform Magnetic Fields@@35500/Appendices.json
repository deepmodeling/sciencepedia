The initial velocity vector of the ion, upon entering this region, makes an angle $\\theta$, where $0 < \\theta < \\pi/2$, with respect to the positive z-axis.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the average velocity of the ion during the time interval corresponding to its first full revolution in the xy-plane. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $m$, $q$, $K_0$, $\\theta$, $B$, and $E$.", "solution": "The average velocity $\\vec{v}_{\\text{avg}}$ over a time interval $\\Delta t$ is defined as the total displacement vector $\\Delta \\vec{r}$ divided by the time interval, $\\vec{v}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\vec{r}}{\\Delta t}$. We need to find the displacement of the ion over one full revolution in the xy-plane and the time it takes to complete this revolution.\n\nFirst, let's determine the initial speed $v_0$ of the ion from its kinetic energy $K_0$.\n$$K_0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \\implies v_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K_0}{m}}$$\nThe initial velocity vector $\\vec{v}_0$ can be decomposed into a component parallel to the z-axis, $v_{0\\parallel}$, and a component perpendicular to the z-axis (in the xy-plane), $v_{0\\perp}$.\n$$v_{0\\parallel} = v_0 \\cos\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K_0}{m}}\\cos\\theta$$\n$$v_{0\\perp} = v_0 \\sin\\theta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K_0}{m}}\\sin\\theta$$\n\nNext, we analyze the force acting on the ion.

The velocity in the z-direction is $v_z(t) = v_{0\\parallel} + a_z t$.\nFor the motion in the xy-plane, the force components are $F_x = m a_x$ and $F_y = m a_y$. This force, $\\vec{F}_{\\perp} = q(\\vec{v}_{\\perp} \\times \\vec{B})$, is always perpendicular to the velocity component in the xy-plane, $\\vec{v}_{\\perp}$. It acts as a centripetal force, causing the ion to move in a circle in the xy-plane. The electric field has no component in the xy-plane and thus does not affect this part of the motion.\n\nThe period of one full revolution in the xy-plane, denoted by $T$, is determined by the magnetic force. The magnitude of the centripetal force is $F_c = q v_{\\perp} B$. This must equal the mass times the centripetal acceleration, $m v_{\\perp}^2/R$, where $R$ is the radius of the circular path.

After one full period $T$, the ion returns to its initial x and y coordinates. Therefore, the displacement in the xy-plane is zero: $\\Delta x = 0$ and $\\Delta y = 0$.\nThe only non-zero component of the displacement is in the z-direction.
