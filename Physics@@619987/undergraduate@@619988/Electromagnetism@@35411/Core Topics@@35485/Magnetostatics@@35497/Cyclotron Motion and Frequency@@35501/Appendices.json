This practice will guide you through the core principle that makes this possible: the cyclotron frequency. By comparing the orbital periods of two different ions in the same magnetic field, you will discover that the period $T$ depends on the particle's mass-to-charge ratio $\\frac{m}{|q|}$ but, crucially, is independent of its velocity [@problem_id:1791470].", "problem": "In an experiment designed to explore the principles of mass spectrometry, two ions are injected into a uniform magnetic field $\\vec{B}$.
