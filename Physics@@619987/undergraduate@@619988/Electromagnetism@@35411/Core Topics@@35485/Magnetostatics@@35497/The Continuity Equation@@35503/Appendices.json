When left in open air, the material interacts with ambient ions, causing the total charge enclosed within the sphere, $Q_{\\text{enc}}(t)$, to change over time. Experimental measurements show that $Q_{\\text{enc}}(t)$ decreases at a perfectly constant rate. This constant rate of decrease is denoted by the positive value $C$, which has units of coulombs per second.

In cylindrical coordinates, the divergence operator acting on such a field is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\frac{1}{s}\\frac{d}{ds}(s D(s))$.\nSo, the condition becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s}\\frac{d}{ds}(s D(s)) = 0 $$\nThis implies that the quantity $s D(s)$ must be a constant.

In electrodynamics, a steady current is one for which the charge density at any point does not change with time, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = 0$. The continuity equation relates the divergence of the current density to the rate of change of charge density:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = 0 $$\nGiven that the current is steady, $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = 0$, which implies:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0 $$\nLike the displacement field, the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ must also be purely radial due to symmetry: $\\mathbf{J}(s) = J(s)\\hat{s}$.

The ratio $\\sigma(s)/\\epsilon(s)$ must be constant.\n\nThe problem specifies the form of the permittivity as $\\epsilon(s) = \\frac{\\kappa}{s}$. We can substitute this into our result:\n$$ \\sigma(s) = \\frac{C_2}{C_1} \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{s}\\right) $$\nThe constants $C_1$, $C_2$, and $\\kappa$ are all fixed for a given physical situation. We can combine them into a single arbitrary constant of proportionality, $C$, as requested by the problem. Let $C = \\frac{C_2 \\kappa}{C_1}$.\nThen, the functional form of the conductivity is:\n$$ \\sigma(s) = \\frac{C}{s} $$\nThis is the required form for the conductivity to ensure the dielectric remains locally neutral.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{C}{s}}$$", "id": "1609781"}]}
