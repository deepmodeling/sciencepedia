It is placed on two long, straight, perfectly conducting rails that lie in the $xy$-plane. The rails meet at the origin, forming an angle $\\alpha$ between them, with the positive $x$-axis acting as the angle bisector. The entire system is immersed in a uniform and constant magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B_0 \\hat{k}$, which is directed perpendicular to the plane of the rails.\n\nAn external agent pulls the rod, causing it to move with a constant velocity $\\vec{v} = v \\hat{i}$ along the positive $x$-axis, starting from a position infinitesimally close to the vertex at time $t=0$. The rod is oriented such that it remains perpendicular to the $x$-axis at all times.\n\nDetermine the total work $W$ done by the external agent on the rod during the time interval from $t=0$ to $t=T$. Express your answer in terms of $B_0$, $v$, $T$, $\\lambda_R$, and $\\alpha$.", "solution": "To find the work done by the external agent, we must first determine the force exerted by the agent. Since the rod moves at a constant velocity, the net force on it is zero. Therefore, the external force, $\\vec{F}_{ext}$, must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the magnetic drag force, $\\vec{F}_{m}$, acting on the rod. The work done is then the integral of this force over the distance traveled.\n\nFirst, let's establish the geometry of the system. The rod's position along the $x$-axis at any time $t$ is given by $x(t) = vt$. The two rails are described by the lines $y = x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$ and $y = -x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$. At a given position $x$, the rod extends from $y_{bottom} = -x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$ to $y_{top} = x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$. The length of the conducting segment of the rod that forms part of the closed circuit is therefore $L_{eff}(x) = y_{top} - y_{bottom} = 2x \\tan(\\alpha/2)$. As a function of time, this length is $L_{eff}(t) = 2(vt) \\tan(\\alpha/2)$.\n\nNext, we calculate the induced electromotive force (EMF), $\\mathcal{E}$, in the closed loop formed by the rod and the rails. We can use Faraday's law of induction, $\\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}$, where $\\Phi_B$ is the magnetic flux through the loop. The area of the triangular loop at time $t$ is $A(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} L_{eff}(t) x(t) = \\frac{1}{2} (2vt \\tan(\\alpha/2)) (vt) = v^2 t^2 \\tan(\\alpha/2)$.\nSince the magnetic field $B_0$ is uniform and perpendicular to the area, the magnetic flux is $\\Phi_B(t) = B_0 A(t) = B_0 v^2 t^2 \\tan(\\alpha/2)$.\nThe magnitude of the induced EMF is then:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}(t) = \\left|-\\frac{d\\Phi_B}{dt}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(B_0 v^2 t^2 \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right)\\right| = 2 B_0 v^2 t \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) $$\n\nNow, we find the induced current $I(t)$ in the circuit. The total resistance of the circuit is the resistance of the rod segment of length $L_{eff}(t)$, as the rails are perfectly conducting. This resistance is $R(t) = \\lambda_R L_{eff}(t) = 2 \\lambda_R v t \\tan(\\alpha/2)$.\nUsing Ohm's law for the circuit, the induced current is:\n$$ I(t) = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}(t)}{R(t)} = \\frac{2 B_0 v^2 t \\tan(\\alpha/2)}{2 \\lambda_R v t \\tan(\\alpha/2)} = \\frac{B_0 v}{\\lambda_R} $$\nInterestingly, the induced current $I$ is constant over time.\n\nThe magnetic force on a straight wire of length $L_{eff}$ carrying current $I$ in a uniform magnetic field $B_0$ is given by $\\vec{F}_m = I (\\vec{L}_{eff} \\times \\vec{B})$. The current direction, by Lenz's law, will be such that the magnetic force opposes the motion. The force magnitude is $F_m = I L_{eff} B_0$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $I$ and $L_{eff}(t)$:\n$$ F_m(t) = \\left(\\frac{B_0 v}{\\lambda_R}\\right) \\left(2vt \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right) B_0 = \\frac{2 B_0^2 v^2 t}{\\lambda_R} \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) $$\nThis force is directed opposite to the velocity, i.e., in the $-\\hat{i}$ direction.\n\nFor the rod to move at a constant velocity, the external agent must apply a force $F_{ext}$ equal in magnitude to $F_m$ and in the direction of motion:\n$$ F_{ext}(t) = \\frac{2 B_0^2 v^2 t}{\\lambda_R} \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the work $W$ done by this external force from $t=0$ to $t=T$.
