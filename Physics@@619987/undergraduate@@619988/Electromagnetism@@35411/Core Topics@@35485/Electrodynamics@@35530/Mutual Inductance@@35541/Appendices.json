However, what happens when the geometric arrangement causes the magnetic flux to cancel itself out? This practice explores the critical role of symmetry and the vector nature of the magnetic field. By analyzing a special case where a wire passes through the center of a loop, you will discover how positive and negative flux contributions can sum to zero, a foundational concept for designing non-interfering circuits. [@problem_id:1594032]", "problem": "An engineer is analyzing a potential source of inductive coupling in a circuit design. The setup consists of a very long, straight wire (wire 1) carrying a current $I_1$, and a flat, circular conducting loop (loop 2) of radius $R$. In the specific configuration under consideration, the straight wire is coplanar with the circular loop and passes directly through its center, lying along one of the loop's diameters. Let $\\mu_0$ represent the permeability of free space. Determine the mutual inductance, $M$, between the wire and the loop in this arrangement. Express your answer in Henries (H).", "solution": "The mutual inductance $M$ between two circuits (in this case, wire 1 and loop 2) is defined by the relation $\\Phi_{21} = M I_1$, where $\\Phi_{21}$ is the magnetic flux through loop 2 created by the current $I_1$ in wire 1. To find $M$, we must first calculate this magnetic flux.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system. We can place the circular loop in the $xy$-plane, centered at the origin. The boundary of the loop is then described by the equation $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$. The long, straight wire lies along a diameter, which we can align with the $x$-axis. So, wire 1 is on the $x$-axis, carrying current $I_1$ (let's assume in the $+x$ direction, though the direction will not affect the final magnitude).\n\nThe magnetic field $\\vec{B}_1$ produced by a long, straight wire carrying current $I_1$ at a perpendicular distance $r$ from the wire has a magnitude given by Ampere's Law:\n$$B_1 = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi r}$$\nThe direction of the magnetic field can be found using the right-hand rule. For the wire on the $x$-axis with current in the $+x$ direction:\n- In the region where $y > 0$ (the upper half-plane), the magnetic field points into the page, i.e., in the negative $z$-direction. So, $\\vec{B}_1 = -\\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi y} \\hat{k}$.\n- In the region where $y < 0$ (the lower half-plane), the magnetic field points out of the page, i.e., in the positive $z$-direction. The perpendicular distance is $|y|$. So, $\\vec{B}_1 = +\\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi |y|} \\hat{k}$.\n\nThe magnetic flux $\\Phi_{21}$ through loop 2 is the integral of the magnetic field over the area of the loop:\n$$\\Phi_{21} = \\iint_{\\text{Area of loop}} \\vec{B}_1 \\cdot d\\vec{A}$$\nWe can choose the area element vector $d\\vec{A}$ to be in the positive $z$-direction for the entire loop: $d\\vec{A} = dA \\, \\hat{k}$.\nThe total area of the loop is composed of two semicircles: the upper semicircle ($y>0$) and the lower semicircle ($y<0$). We can calculate the flux through each part separately and add them.\n\nFor the upper semicircle (Area$_{\\text{upper}}$), where $y > 0$:\nThe flux is $\\Phi_{\\text{upper}} = \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{upper}}} \\vec{B}_1 \\cdot d\\vec{A}$.\n$$\\Phi_{\\text{upper}} = \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{upper}}} \\left(-\\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi y} \\hat{k}\\right) \\cdot (dA \\, \\hat{k}) = -\\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{upper}}} \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi y} dA$$\n\nFor the lower semicircle (Area$_{\\text{lower}}$), where $y < 0$:\nThe flux is $\\Phi_{\\text{lower}} = \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{lower}}} \\vec{B}_1 \\cdot d\\vec{A}$. The distance is $|y|$.\n$$\\Phi_{\\text{lower}} = \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{lower}}} \\left(+\\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi |y|} \\hat{k}\\right) \\cdot (dA \\, \\hat{k}) = +\\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{lower}}} \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi |y|} dA$$\n\nThe total flux is $\\Phi_{21} = \\Phi_{\\text{upper}} + \\Phi_{\\text{lower}}$.\n$$\\Phi_{21} = -\\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{upper}}} \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi y} dA + \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{lower}}} \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi |y|} dA$$\nBy the symmetry of the circular loop, for any infinitesimal area element $dA$ in the upper semicircle at a distance $y$ from the wire, there is a corresponding area element $dA$ in the lower semicircle at a distance $|-y|=y$ from the wire.\nThe magnitude of the magnetic field $\\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi y}$ is the same for these two corresponding area elements. However, the field points in opposite directions. Since our area vector $d\\vec{A}$ has a single direction ($\\hat{k}$), the contribution to the flux from the upper semicircle is exactly the negative of the contribution from the lower semicircle.\n\nTo see this more formally, let's express the integral over the lower area in terms of positive coordinates. Let $y' = -y$. Then $|y| = |y'| = y'$ and $dA$ at $y$ corresponds to $dA$ at $y'$. The integration over the lower semicircle (from $y=0$ to $y=-R$) is equivalent to integrating from $y'=0$ to $y'=R$.\n$$\\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{lower}}} \\frac{1}{|y|} dA = \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{upper}}} \\frac{1}{y'} dA'$$\nSince $y'$ is a dummy variable of integration, this is identical to $\\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{upper}}} \\frac{1}{y} dA$.\n\nTherefore, the total flux is:\n$$\\Phi_{21} = -\\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{upper}}} \\frac{1}{y} dA \\right) + \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{lower}}} \\frac{1}{|y|} dA \\right)$$\n$$\\Phi_{21} = -\\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{upper}}} \\frac{1}{y} dA \\right) + \\frac{\\mu_0 I_1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\iint_{\\text{Area}_{\\text{upper}}} \\frac{1}{y} dA \\right) = 0$$\nThe net magnetic flux through the entire circular loop is zero.\n\nNow we can find the mutual inductance $M$:\n$$M = \\frac{\\Phi_{21}}{I_1} = \\frac{0}{I_1} = 0$$\nThe mutual inductance between the wire and the loop in this configuration is zero. This result holds regardless of the radius $R$ of the loop or the current $I_1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1594032"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's apply the concept of flux linkage to a ubiquitous and practical component: the coaxial cable.
