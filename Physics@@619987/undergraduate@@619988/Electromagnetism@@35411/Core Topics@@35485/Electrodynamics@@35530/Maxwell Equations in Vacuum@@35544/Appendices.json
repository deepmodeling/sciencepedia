The governing equation that relates magnetic fields to electric currents and time-varying electric fields is the Ampere-Maxwell law. In its integral form, the equation is:\n$$\n\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 I_{\\text{enc}} + \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{d\\Phi_E}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $I_{\\text{enc}}$ is the conventional current enclosed by the loop and $\\Phi_E$ is the electric flux through the surface bounded by the loop.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the region is \"far from any electric charges or conventional currents,\" which implies that the enclosed conventional current $I_{\\text{enc}}$ is zero. Therefore, the Ampere-Maxwell law simplifies to:\n$$\n\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{d\\Phi_E}{dt}\n$$\nThis term, $\\epsilon_0 \\frac{d\\Phi_E}{dt}$, is known as the displacement current.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the electric flux, $\\Phi_E$, through the circular loop. The electric flux is defined as the surface integral of the electric field over the area enclosed by the loop:\n$$\n\\Phi_E = \\int_S \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A}\n$$\nHere, $S$ is the circular surface of radius $R$ in the x-y plane. The problem specifies that the line integral for the circulation is taken in the counter-clockwise direction when viewed from the positive z-axis. By the right-hand rule, the differential area vector $d\\vec{A}$ for this surface points in the positive z-direction, so $d\\vec{A} = dA \\, \\hat{z}$.\n\nThe electric field is given as $\\vec{E}(t) = \\alpha t \\hat{z}$. Now we can compute the dot product inside the integral:\n$$\n\\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = (\\alpha t \\hat{z}) \\cdot (dA \\, \\hat{z}) = \\alpha t \\, dA\n$$\nSince the electric field $\\vec{E}(t)$ is spatially uniform over the entire surface of the loop, the term $\\alpha t$ is constant with respect to the spatial integration. We can take it out of the integral:\n$$\n\\Phi_E = \\int_S \\alpha t \\, dA = \\alpha t \\int_S dA\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_S dA$ is simply the total area of the circular loop, which is $A = \\pi R^2$. Thus, the electric flux is:\n$$\n\\Phi_E(t) = \\alpha t (\\pi R^2)\n$$\n\nNow, we must find the time derivative of the electric flux, $\\frac{d\\Phi_E}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Phi_E}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\alpha \\pi R^2 t)\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$, $\\pi$, and $R$ are all constants with respect to time, the derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Phi_E}{dt} = \\alpha \\pi R^2\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the simplified Ampere-Maxwell equation to find the circulation of the magnetic field:\n$$\n\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\left( \\alpha \\pi R^2 \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms into a standard order, we get the final expression for the circulation.\n$$\n\\oint \\vec{B} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\pi \\alpha R^2\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\pi \\alpha R^{2}}$$", "id": "1807921"}, {"introduction": "Maxwell's equations are more than descriptive; they are prescriptive, dictating the fundamental properties of electromagnetic waves.

We will test the given field against each of Maxwell's equations under these vacuum conditions.\n\nThe components of the electric field are $E_x = 0$, $E_y = 0$, and $E_z = E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t)$.\n\n**A. Gauss's Law for electricity**\n\nIn a vacuum, where $\\rho = 0$, Gauss's Law becomes $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$. Let's calculate the divergence of the given electric field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\nSubstituting the components of our field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial (0)}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} [E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t)]\n$$\nThe only non-zero term is the partial derivative with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = E_0 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} [\\cos(kz - \\omega t)] = E_0 [-k \\sin(kz - \\omega t)]\n$$\nSo, we find:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = -k E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t)\n$$\nSince $k$ and $E_0$ are non-zero, the divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E}$ is generally not zero. However, Gauss's Law in a vacuum requires $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$. This is a direct contradiction. Therefore, the proposed longitudinal electric field violates Gauss's Law for electricity.\n\nLet's briefly examine the other equations to confirm our understanding, although we have already found a violation.\n\n**B. Gauss's Law for magnetism**\n\nThis law, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$, involves only the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$. It does not directly impose a constraint on $\\vec{E}$ by itself. We would first need to find a candidate for $\\vec{B}$. So, this law is not directly violated by the given $\\vec{E}$ field alone.\n\n**C. Faraday's Law of Induction**\n\nIn a vacuum, Faraday's Law is $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = - \\partial \\vec{B} / \\partial t$. Let's compute the curl of the given $\\vec{E}$ field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\\\ E_x & E_y & E_z \\end{vmatrix} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{x} & \\hat{y} & \\hat{z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\\\ 0 & 0 & E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t) \\end{vmatrix}\n$$\nExpanding the determinant:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\hat{x} \\left( \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z} \\right) - \\hat{y} \\left( \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial z} \\right) + \\hat{z} \\left( \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y} \\right)\n$$\nSince $E_z$ only depends on $z$ and $t$, its derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are zero. Since $E_x$ and $E_y$ are zero, all their derivatives are zero. Thus, every term in the curl is zero:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\vec{0}\n$$\nSo, from Faraday's Law, we have $-\\partial \\vec{B} / \\partial t = \\vec{0}$. This implies that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ must be static (i.e., not a function of time). A time-independent magnetic field does not violate Faraday's Law with this $\\vec{E}$, so this law is not violated on its own.\n\n**D. The Ampère-Maxwell Law**\n\nIn a vacuum where $\\vec{J} = \\vec{0}$, this law is $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\partial \\vec{E} / \\partial t$.\nFrom our analysis of Faraday's Law, we concluded that for this $\\vec{E}$ to exist, the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ must be static, $\\vec{B} = \\vec{B}(\\vec{r})$. The curl of a static field, $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}$, is also static (independent of time).\nNow let's look at the right-hand side of the Ampère-Maxwell equation.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} [E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z}] = E_0 [-\\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\cdot (-\\omega)] \\hat{z} = \\omega E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z}\n$$\nSo the right-hand side is $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z}$. This is a time-varying quantity.\nWe have a contradiction:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}(\\vec{r}) = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z}\n$$\nA time-independent vector field (LHS) cannot be equal to a non-zero, time-dependent vector field (RHS). This shows there is also an inconsistency with the Ampère-Maxwell Law, but it arises from trying to satisfy Faraday's Law and the Ampère-Maxwell Law simultaneously.\n\nThe most direct and immediate violation is with Gauss's Law. The equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$ is a condition on the electric field alone in a source-free region. The proposed longitudinal field fails this test directly, without any need to consider the magnetic field or any other laws.
