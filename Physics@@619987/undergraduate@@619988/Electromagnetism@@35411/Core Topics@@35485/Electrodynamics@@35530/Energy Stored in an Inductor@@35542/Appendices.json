The system stores energy in the magnetic field of a large superconducting coil with a constant inductance $L$. In its initial steady-state configuration, a current $I_i$ flows through the coil, and the total magnetic energy stored is $U_i$. Due to an anticipated increase in power demand, the grid operators decide to double the amount of energy stored in the SMES system to a new steady-state value, $U_f = 2U_i$. To accomplish this, the current is adjusted to a new value, $I_f$.
