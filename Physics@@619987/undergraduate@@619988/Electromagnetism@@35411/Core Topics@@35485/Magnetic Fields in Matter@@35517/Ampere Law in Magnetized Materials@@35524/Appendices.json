{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The auxiliary field $\\vec{H}$ is an exceptionally useful tool for analyzing magnetic materials. This is because its behavior is governed by Ampere's law written in terms of free currents, $\\oint \\vec{H} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = I_{f, \\text{enc}}$, making calculations in symmetric scenarios straightforward. This practice challenges you to apply this law to a current-carrying wire embedded in a magnetic material, clearly demonstrating how the $\\vec{H}$-field is determined by the free current, while the total magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is modified by the material's presence [@problem_id:1806144].", "problem": "Consider a very long, straight wire carrying a constant free current $I_f$. This wire is located on the central axis of a thick, concentric cylindrical shell made of a uniform, linear magnetic material. The material has an inner radius $a$ and an outer radius $b$. The magnetic permeability of this material is given by $\\mu = k \\mu_0$, where $k$ is a dimensionless constant and $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $k$, $s_1$, and $s_2$.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find the magnetic field at two different radial distances from a current-carrying wire, where one point is inside a magnetic material and the other is in a vacuum. We will use Ampere's law for magnetic materials, which is expressed in terms of the auxiliary magnetic field $\\vec{H}$.\n\nThe form of Ampere's law suitable for this problem is $\\oint \\vec{H} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = I_{f, \\text{enc}}$, where $I_{f, \\text{enc}}$ is the total free current enclosed by the Amperian loop. The relationship between the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$, the auxiliary field $\\vec{H}$, and the permeability of the medium $\\mu$ is $\\vec{B} = \\mu \\vec{H}$ for a linear magnetic material.\n\nFirst, we determine the auxiliary field $\\vec{H}$ as a function of the radial distance $s$ from the wire. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem, the magnetic field lines (for both $\\vec{B}$ and $\\vec{H}$) must be concentric circles centered on the wire. We choose a circular Amperian loop of radius $s$ concentric with the wire.\n\nFor any loop of radius $s > 0$, the enclosed free current is simply the current in the wire, $I_{f, \\text{enc}} = I_f$.\n\nBy symmetry, the magnitude of $\\vec{H}$ is constant along our Amperian loop, and $\\vec{H}$ is everywhere parallel to the differential line element $d\\vec{l}$. Therefore, the line integral simplifies to:\n$$\n\\oint \\vec{H} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = H \\oint dl = H(2\\pi s)\n$$\nApplying Ampere's law:\n$$\nH(2\\pi s) = I_f\n$$\nSolving for the magnitude of the auxiliary field $H$, we find that for any radial distance $s > 0$:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{I_f}{2\\pi s}\n$$\nThis expression for $H(s)$ is valid both inside the magnetic material and in the vacuum regions, as it only depends on the free current.\n\nNext, we find the magnitude of the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ at the two specified locations.\n\nCase 1: Find $B_1$ at a radial distance $s_1$ such that $a < s_1 < b$.\nThis point is inside the linear magnetic material, which has a permeability $\\mu = k \\mu_0$. The relationship between $B$ and $H$ in this region is $B = \\mu H$.\n$$\nB_1 = B(s_1) = \\mu H(s_1) = (k \\mu_0) \\left(\\frac{I_f}{2\\pi s_1}\\right)\n$$\nSo, we have:\n$$\nB_1 = \\frac{k \\mu_0 I_f}{2\\pi s_1}\n$$\n\nCase 2: Find $B_2$ at a radial distance $s_2$ such that $s_2 > b$.\nThis point is in the vacuum region outside the cylindrical shell. In a vacuum, the permeability is $\\mu_0$. The relationship between $B$ and $H$ is $B = \\mu_0 H$.\n$$\nB_2 = B(s_2) = \\mu_0 H(s_2) = \\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{I_f}{2\\pi s_2}\\right)\n$$\nSo, we have:\n$$\nB_2 = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_f}{2\\pi s_2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio $\\frac{B_1}{B_2}$.\n$$\n\\frac{B_1}{B_2} = \\frac{\\frac{k \\mu_0 I_f}{2\\pi s_1}}{\\frac{\\mu_0 I_f}{2\\pi s_2}}\n$$\nWe can cancel the common terms $\\mu_0$, $I_f$, and $2\\pi$ from the numerator and the denominator.\n$$\n\\frac{B_1}{B_2} = \\frac{\\frac{k}{s_1}}{\\frac{1}{s_2}} = k \\frac{s_2}{s_1}\n$$\nThe final result is a dimensionless ratio, as expected.
