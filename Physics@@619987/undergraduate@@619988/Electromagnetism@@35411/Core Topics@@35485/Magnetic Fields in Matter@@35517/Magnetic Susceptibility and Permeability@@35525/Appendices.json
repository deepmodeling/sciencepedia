They construct a very long solenoid and place a cylindrical core made of this alloy inside it, such that the core completely fills the solenoid's interior volume. When no current flows through the solenoid, the magnetic field is zero. When a steady current is passed through the solenoid's windings, a magnetic field is generated. The team first measures the magnetic field strength inside the solenoid with a vacuum core, which we can denote as $B_{vac}$. They then insert the alloy core and, keeping the current identical, measure the magnetic field strength inside the alloy, which we denote as $B_{mat}$. They find that the magnetic field strength inside the alloy is greater than in the vacuum. Specifically, the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the alloy is $0.021\\%$ larger than its magnitude in a vacuum.

This H-field is determined by the external current source and is independent of the material inside the solenoid.\n\nStep 2: Define the magnetic field (B-field) in vacuum and in the material.\nIn a vacuum, the magnetic field $B_{vac}$ is related to the H-field by the permeability of free space, $\\mu_0$:\n$$B_{vac} = \\mu_0 H$$\nWhen the solenoid is filled with a magnetic material, the material becomes magnetized, and the total magnetic field inside, $B_{mat}$, is given by:\n$$B_{mat} = \\mu H$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the permeability of the material.\n\nStep 3: Define and use the relative permeability, $\\mu_r$.\nThe relative permeability $\\mu_r$ is a dimensionless factor that compares the permeability of a material to that of free space:\n$$\\mu_r = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_0}$$\nWe can rewrite the expression for $B_{mat}$ using $\\mu_r$:\n$$B_{mat} = \\mu H = (\\mu_r \\mu_0) H = \\mu_r (\\mu_0 H)$$\nRecognizing that $\\mu_0 H = B_{vac}$, we have the key relationship:\n$$B_{mat} = \\mu_r B_{vac}$$\nThis means the relative permeability is the ratio of the magnetic field inside the material to the magnetic field that would exist in a vacuum for the same H-field.\n$$\\mu_r = \\frac{B_{mat}}{B_{vac}}$$\n\nStep 4: Use the information provided in the problem to calculate $\\mu_r$.\nThe problem states that the magnetic field inside the alloy, $B_{mat}$, is $0.021\\%$ larger than the field in a vacuum, $B_{vac}$.

A percentage increase of $p\\%$ means the new value is the original value plus $p/100$ times the original value.\nHere, $p = 0.021$.\n$$B_{mat} = B_{vac} + \\frac{0.021}{100} B_{vac}$$\n$$B_{mat} = B_{vac} \\left(1 + \\frac{0.021}{100}\\right)$$\n$$B_{mat} = B_{vac} (1 + 0.00021)$$\n$$B_{mat} = 1.00021 B_{vac}$$\nNow we can find $\\mu_r$ using the ratio from Step 3:\n$$\\mu_r = \\frac{B_{mat}}{B_{vac}} = \\frac{1.00021 B_{vac}}{B_{vac}} = 1.00021$$\n\nStep 5: Calculate the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_m$.\nThe magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_m$ is related to the relative permeability $\\mu_r$ by the definition:\n$$\\chi_m = \\mu_r - 1$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\mu_r$ we found:\n$$\\chi_m = 1.00021 - 1 = 0.00021$$\nThis can be written in scientific notation as:\n$$\\chi_m = 2.1 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n\nStep 6: Classify the material based on the value of $\\chi_m$.\nThe classification of magnetic materials is based on the sign and magnitude of their magnetic susceptibility:\n- If $\\chi_m  0$, the material is Diamagnetic. The internal field is slightly weaker than the external field.\n- If $\\chi_m > 0$ and is small (typically on the order of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-3}$), the material is Paramagnetic. The internal field is slightly stronger than the external field.\n- If $\\chi_m \\gg 1$, the material is Ferromagnetic. The internal field is much stronger than the external field.\n\nIn our case, $\\chi_m = 2.1 \\times 10^{-4}$.

A negative $\\chi_m$ would imply diamagnetism.\n- D: Incorrect sign for $\\chi_m$, although the classification (Diamagnetic) would be correct for a negative $\\chi_m$.\n- E: Incorrectly identifies $\\mu_r$ as $\\chi_m$. Also, while some ferromagnetic materials have $\\mu_r$ this low *above* their Curie temperature (where they behave paramagnetically), the term ferromagnetic implies a much larger response.\n- F: Mixes up the percentage value with the decimal value in the calculation, i.e., incorrectly calculating $\\chi_m = 0.021$ from an increase of $0.021\\%$.
