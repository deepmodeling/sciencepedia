The region of vacuum is for $z0$ (Region 1) and the diamagnetic material is for $z0$ (Region 2). The interface is the plane $z=0$. The unit vector normal to the surface is $\\hat{k}$.\n\nThe problem states that the magnetic field in the vacuum, $\\vec{B}_1$, makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the surface of the plate. The angle the field makes with the normal to the surface, which we will call $\\theta_1$, is therefore $\\theta_1 = 90^\\circ - \\alpha$.\n\nWe can decompose the magnetic field $\\vec{B}_1$ into its components normal and parallel to the surface:\nThe component normal to the surface is:\n$B_{1,n} = |\\vec{B}_1| \\cos(\\theta_1) = B_1 \\cos(90^\\circ - \\alpha) = B_1 \\sin(\\alpha)$\nThe component parallel to the surface is:\n$B_{1,\\parallel} = |\\vec{B}_1| \\sin(\\theta_1) = B_1 \\sin(90^\\circ - \\alpha) = B_1 \\cos(\\alpha)$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions for magnetic fields at the interface between two media.\n1.
