Determine the electric flux through the surface area of just one of these two triangular regions.\n\nExpress your answer as an analytic expression in terms of the charge $q$ and the vacuum permittivity, $\\epsilon_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the electric flux through a specific triangular portion of one face of a cube that encloses a point charge $q$ at its center. We can solve this problem by applying Gauss's Law and leveraging the symmetry of the configuration.\n\nGauss's Law states that the total electric flux, $\\Phi_{total}$, through any closed surface (a Gaussian surface) is equal to the total charge enclosed by that surface, $Q_{enc}$, divided by the vacuum permittivity, $\\epsilon_0$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\Phi_{total} = \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A} = \\frac{Q_{enc}}{\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nLet's choose the entire cube as our Gaussian surface. This surface is closed and encloses the point charge $q$. Therefore, the total charge enclosed is $Q_{enc} = q$. The total electric flux passing through all six faces of the cube is:\n$$ \\Phi_{total} = \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nNext, we use a symmetry argument. The point charge is located at the geometric center of the cube. Due to this central placement, the charge is equidistant from each of the six faces, and the electric field it produces has the same distribution pattern over each face. Consequently, the total electric flux must be shared equally among the six identical faces of the cube.\n\nLet $\\Phi_{face}$ be the flux through any single square face. Then:\n$$ \\Phi_{face} = \\frac{\\Phi_{total}}{6} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left( \\frac{q}{\\epsilon_0} \\right) = \\frac{q}{6\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nNow, we need to find the flux through only a part of this face: one of the two identical right-angled triangles formed by a diagonal. Let's call the two triangular regions $T_1$ and $T_2$. The flux through the entire face is the sum of the fluxes through these two regions:\n$$ \\Phi_{face} = \\Phi_{T_1} + \\Phi_{T_2} $$\n\nWe can apply another symmetry argument. The charge is at the center of the cube. A plane containing the center of the cube and the diagonal of the face in question will bisect the cube's interior and the face's surface symmetrically. The electric field distribution is symmetric with respect to this plane. Therefore, the flux passing through triangle $T_1$ must be equal to the flux passing through triangle $T_2$.\n$$ \\Phi_{T_1} = \\Phi_{T_2} $$\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation for the flux through the face, we get:\n$$ \\Phi_{face} = \\Phi_{T_1} + \\Phi_{T_1} = 2\\Phi_{T_1} $$\n\nThe flux through one triangular region, which we can call $\\Phi_{triangle}$, is therefore half the flux through the entire face:\n$$ \\Phi_{triangle} = \\Phi_{T_1} = \\frac{\\Phi_{face}}{2} $$\n\nFinally, substituting the expression we found for $\\Phi_{face}$:\n$$ \\Phi_{triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{q}{6\\epsilon_0} \\right) = \\frac{q}{12\\epsilon_0} $$\n\nThe side length $L$ of the cube does not affect the total enclosed flux or its distribution among the faces, so it does not appear in the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{q}{12 \\epsilon_{0}}}$$", "id": "1583782"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, this practice [@problem_id:1800457] moves to a more realistic and complex scenario: a sphere with a non-uniform charge density.
