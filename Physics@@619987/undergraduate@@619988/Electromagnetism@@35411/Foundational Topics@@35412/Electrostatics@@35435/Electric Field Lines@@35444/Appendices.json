By considering a hollow conductor in the presence of an external charge, we use the fundamental properties of conductors in equilibrium to deduce the behavior of the electric field within an enclosed empty cavity. Understanding this principle, often associated with the Faraday cage, is essential as it has vast practical applications in protecting sensitive electronics from external electrical interference [@problem_id:1576894].", "problem": "An isolated, uncharged, hollow conducting box has the shape of a perfect cube. Let the region inside the hollow box be denoted by $\\mathcal{R}$. A single point charge with positive charge $+Q$ is placed in the vacuum outside the box, positioned near the center of one of its faces. The system is allowed to reach electrostatic equilibrium.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the electric field lines within the region $\\mathcal{R}$?\n\nA. Electric field lines originate from the inner wall of the box and terminate at the geometric center of the cube, where there is a net negative charge.\nB. The electric field inside the region $\\mathcal{R}$ is non-zero and uniform, pointing directly away from the external charge $+Q$.\nC. There are no electric field lines present anywhere within the region $\\mathcal{R}$.\nD. Electric field lines originating from the external charge $+Q$ pass through the region $\\mathcal{R}$ as if the conducting box were not present.\nE. Electric field lines originate from the inner surface of the face closest to the external charge and terminate on the inner surface of the opposite face.", "solution": "We analyze the interior of a hollow, uncharged, perfectly conducting cube in electrostatic equilibrium when an external point charge $+Q$ is placed outside the conductor.\n\n1) In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the bulk of a conductor is zero. Hence, the conductor is an equipotential: if $V$ denotes the electric potential, then $V=\\text{constant}$ throughout the conducting material.\n\n2) The inner surface of the cavity is part of the conductor and must also be at the same constant potential. Therefore, the boundary of the region $\\mathcal{R}$ (the cavity interior) is an equipotential surface with $V=V_{0}$ constant.\n\n3) Inside the cavity region $\\mathcal{R}$ there are no free charges, so the charge density satisfies $\\rho=0$. Hence the potential in $\\mathcal{R}$ satisfies Laplace’s equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^{2}V=0 \\quad \\text{in } \\mathcal{R}, \\quad \\text{with } V|_{\\partial \\mathcal{R}}=V_{0}.\n$$\n\n4) By the uniqueness theorem for solutions of Laplace’s equation, the only solution in $\\mathcal{R}$ with constant Dirichlet boundary condition $V_{0}$ is\n$$\nV(\\mathbf{r})=V_{0} \\quad \\text{for all } \\mathbf{r}\\in \\mathcal{R}.\n$$\n\n5) Therefore, the electric field inside the cavity is\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})=-\\nabla V(\\mathbf{r})=\\mathbf{0} \\quad \\text{for all } \\mathbf{r}\\in \\mathcal{R}.\n$$\nSince the electric field is identically zero everywhere in $\\mathcal{R}$, there are no electric field lines within $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\n6) This conclusion rules out alternatives that suggest nonzero fields or field lines inside the cavity (such as a uniform field, field lines passing through as if no conductor were present, or lines between inner surfaces). It also rules out any claim of a net charge at the geometric center, as there are no charges inside the cavity and the field is zero there.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that there are no electric field lines anywhere within $\\mathcal{R}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1576894"}, {"introduction": "Electric field lines are a rigorous visualization of a vector field, where the tangent to a line at any point gives the direction of the electric field vector $\\mathbf{E}$ at that point. This exercise probes a crucial rule governing these lines: they can never intersect. The reasoning is tied directly to the principle of superposition, which guarantees that the net electric field at any point in space is unique, thus allowing for only one possible direction for a field line to pass through it [@problem_id:1793596].", "problem": "Two positive point charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$, are fixed in space. A student attempts to visualize the combined electric field by sketching the field lines. Their sketch shows a field line originating from $q_1$ and another field line originating from $q_2$ intersecting at a point $P$, which is located in a region of empty space where there are no other charges. The student realizes this configuration is physically impossible.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental and accurate physical reason why two electric field lines from static charges cannot intersect at a point in empty space?\n\nA. The principle of superposition requires that the net electric field vector at any point in space must be unique.\nB. Gauss's Law states that field lines can only originate from positive charges and terminate on negative charges, so an intersection would violate the source/sink definition.\nC. The potential at the point of intersection would be multi-valued, which violates the law of conservation of energy for a test charge moved to that point.\nD. The electrostatic force is a conservative force, which means that the work done moving a charge between two points must be path-independent, a condition that cannot be met if field lines cross.\nE. An intersection would imply that two separate equipotential surfaces are passing through the same point, which is physically impossible.", "solution": "For a set of static point charges $\\{q_{i}\\}$ fixed at positions $\\{\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\}$, the electrostatic field at any point $\\mathbf{r}$ in empty space (i.e., for $\\mathbf{r} \\neq \\mathbf{r}_{i}$ for all $i$) is given uniquely by the superposition principle applied to Coulomb’s law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})=\\sum_{i}\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\,q_{i}\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{i}}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{i}|^{3}}.\n$$\nThis sum yields a single, well-defined vector at each such point. Hence, the net electric field vector is unique at every point in empty space.\n\nElectric field lines are defined as the integral curves of $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})$, i.e., curves $\\mathbf{r}(s)$ whose tangent is everywhere parallel to the field:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}=\\lambda(s)\\,\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}(s)),\n$$\nfor some scalar $\\lambda(s)$ chosen to set the parametrization. At any point where $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r})\\neq \\mathbf{0}$, this differential equation defines a unique tangent direction. If two distinct field lines were to intersect at a point $\\mathbf{P}$ in empty space with $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{P})\\neq \\mathbf{0}$, they would impose two different tangent directions at $\\mathbf{P}$, which would require two different values for the direction of $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{P})$. This contradicts the uniqueness of $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{P})$ guaranteed by superposition. Therefore, field lines from static charges cannot intersect in empty space.\n\nBy comparison with the options:\n- A is the fundamental reason: the net field vector at each point is unique by superposition, so only one field-line direction is possible at that point.\n- B invokes Gauss’s law about sources and sinks, which constrains where lines begin and end but does not directly prohibit intersections; the prohibition follows from the uniqueness of $\\mathbf{E}$, not from source/sink counting.\n- C claims the potential would be multi-valued at the intersection, which is incorrect; the scalar potential remains single-valued, and the prohibition of crossing does not rest on multivalued potential.\n- D appeals to conservativeness and path independence, which do not by themselves forbid geometric crossing of integral curves; the key issue is the local uniqueness of the vector field.\n- E incorrectly characterizes equipotential behavior; a unique potential value passes through each point, and the prohibition of crossing field lines is not best argued by invoking multiple equipotential surfaces.\n\nThus the most fundamental and accurate statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1793596"}, {"introduction": "This practice bridges the gap between the static visualization of electric fields and the dynamics of charged particles moving within them.
