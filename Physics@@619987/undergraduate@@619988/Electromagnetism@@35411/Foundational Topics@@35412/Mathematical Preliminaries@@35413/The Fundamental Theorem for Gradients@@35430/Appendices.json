In this expression, $C$ is a known constant characterizing the strength of the field, and $k$ is an arbitrary constant that sets the reference potential. A particle of charge $q$ is moved from its initial position at the origin, $P_i = (0, 0, 0)$, to a final position $P_f = (L, L, 0)$, where $L$ is a characteristic length of the setup. The particle follows a specific path composed of two straight segments: first, it moves along the x-axis from $(0,0,0)$ to $(L,0,0)$, and then it moves parallel to the y-axis from $(L,0,0)$ to $(L,L,0)$.\n\nCalculate the total work done by the electrostatic field on the particle as it moves from $P_i$ to $P_f$.
