This requires determining the electric field $\\vec{E}$ on that face.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the symmetries of the charge distribution, $\\rho(x, y, z) = \\frac{\\rho_0 x}{a}$. The charge density varies only with the $x$-coordinate and is independent of $y$ and $z$. For an infinitely large slab with such a charge distribution, the electric field would, by symmetry, have only an $x$-component, i.e., $\\vec{E} = E_x(x) \\hat{x}$. For a finite cube, there will be fringing fields near the edges. However, the dominant component of the field, especially near the center of the faces, will be in the $x$-direction. We will proceed by assuming the field is well-approximated by this one-dimensional form throughout the cube, which is a common and powerful technique for problems with planar symmetry.\n\nWith the assumption $\\vec{E} = E_x(x) \\hat{x}$, we can use Gauss's Law in its differential form, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}$.\nThe divergence of $\\vec{E}$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\nSince we assume $E_y=0$ and $E_z=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{dE_x}{dx}\n$$\nEquating this with $\\rho/\\epsilon_0$, we get a differential equation for $E_x(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_x}{dx} = \\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_0} = \\frac{\\rho_0 x}{a \\epsilon_0}\n$$\nTo find $E_x(x)$, we integrate with respect to $x$:\n$$\nE_x(x) = \\int \\frac{\\rho_0 x}{a \\epsilon_0} dx = \\frac{\\rho_0 x^2}{2a\\epsilon_0} + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is an integration constant.\n\nTo determine $C$, we use another symmetry argument. The charge distribution is antisymmetric with respect to the $yz$-plane at $x=0$, since $\\rho(x) = -\\rho(-x)$. For every infinitesimal charge element $dq$ at a position $(x, y, z)$, there is an opposite charge element $-dq$ at $(-x, y, z)$. At any point on the $x=0$ plane, the electric field contributions from such a pair of charges will cancel each other out in terms of their net effect along the x-axis, or can be argued based on the overall symmetry. A simpler argument is that the structure of charges is perfectly antisymmetric about $x=0$, so there can be no preferred direction for the field at the center of symmetry. Thus, the electric field must be zero at the center plane: $E_x(0) = 0$.\n\nApplying this boundary condition to our expression for $E_x(x)$:\n$$\nE_x(0) = \\frac{\\rho_0 (0)^2}{2a\\epsilon_0} + C = 0 \\implies C = 0\n$$\nSo, the electric field inside the cube is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{E}(x) = \\frac{\\rho_0 x^2}{2a\\epsilon_0} \\hat{x}\n$$\nNow we can calculate the electric flux through the face at $x=a/2$. The surface $S$ is a square in the $yz$-plane defined by $-a/2 \\le y \\le a/2$ and $-a/2 \\le z \\le a/2$. The differential area element for this face, with its normal pointing outwards from the cube, is $d\\vec{A} = dy dz \\hat{x}$.\n\nThe flux $\\Phi$ is the surface integral:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\int_S \\vec{E} \\cdot d\\vec{A}\n$$\nOn this face, the coordinate $x$ is constant at $x=a/2$. So the electric field is uniform over this surface:\n$$\n\\vec{E}(x=a/2) = \\frac{\\rho_0 (a/2)^2}{2a\\epsilon_0} \\hat{x} = \\frac{\\rho_0 a^2/4}{2a\\epsilon_0} \\hat{x} = \\frac{\\rho_0 a}{8\\epsilon_0} \\hat{x}\n$$\nNow we compute the dot product and the integral:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_0 a}{8\\epsilon_0} \\hat{x} \\right) \\cdot (dy dz \\hat{x})\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{\\rho_0 a}{8\\epsilon_0} \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} dy dz\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} \\int_{-a/2}^{a/2} dy dz$ is simply the area of the square face, which is $a \\times a = a^2$.\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{\\rho_0 a}{8\\epsilon_0} \\times a^2 = \\frac{\\rho_0 a^3}{8\\epsilon_0}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\rho_0 a^{3}}{8 \\epsilon_0}}$$", "id": "1570763"}, {"introduction": "This final practice transitions from statics to the dynamic interplay between fields and charged particles.
