The divergence of this vector field is known to be zero. Without performing any calculations, select the option that provides the correct physical justification for why the divergence of the velocity field for any rigid body rotation must be zero.\n\nA. The acceleration of every point within the disk is zero because the angular velocity is constant.\n\nB. The velocity of every point within the disk is constant, leading to a static field with zero divergence.\n\nC. The flow is irrotational, and irrotational fields always have zero divergence.\n\nD.

Hence, the correct justification is that a rigid body is incompressible in this kinematic sense: there is no local expansion or compression of volume elements. This corresponds to option D. Options A, B, C, and E do not capture this volumetric argument: accelerations are not zero in uniform rotation, the velocity field is not spatially constant, rigid rotation is not irrotational, and orthogonality of velocity to position does not imply zero divergence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2140595"}, {"introduction": "With a strong conceptual understanding, we can now move to quantifying divergence.
