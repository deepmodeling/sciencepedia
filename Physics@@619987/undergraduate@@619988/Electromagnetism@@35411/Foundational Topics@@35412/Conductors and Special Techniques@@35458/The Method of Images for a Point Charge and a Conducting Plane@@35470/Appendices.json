A single point charge of magnitude $+q$ is placed at the coordinates $(a, a, 0)$, where $a$ is a positive constant.\n\nTo satisfy the boundary condition that the electric potential is zero everywhere on the conducting planes, one can use the method of images. This method replaces the conducting planes with a set of \"image\" point charges placed in the regions $x < 0$ or $y < 0$.

With two perpendicular grounded planes, we must satisfy both boundaries simultaneously. Starting from the real charge $+q$ at $(a,a,0)$, reflect across $x=0$ to place an image $-q$ at $(-a,a,0)$ (to enforce $V=0$ on $x=0$), and reflect across $y=0$ to place an image $-q$ at $(a,-a,0)$ (to enforce $V=0$ on $y=0$). These two images alone do not yet satisfy both planes simultaneously, because enforcing one plane by reflection can spoil the other. Therefore reflect once more across both planes (equivalently, reflect either image across the other plane) to place a third image at $(-a,-a,0)$.
