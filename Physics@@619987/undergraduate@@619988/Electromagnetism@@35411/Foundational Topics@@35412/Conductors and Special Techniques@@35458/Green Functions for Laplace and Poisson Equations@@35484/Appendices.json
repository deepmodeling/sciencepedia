The space is otherwise empty of charge. Two infinite, flat, conducting plates are introduced, which are held at zero electric potential (grounded). The first plate occupies the entire $y-z$ plane (the plane $x=0$), and the second plate occupies the entire $x-z$ plane (the plane $y=0$). These plates form a 90-degree corner. The goal is to determine the electric potential in the region where $x > 0$ and $y > 0$.

This pair makes $V(0,y,0)=0$ for all $y$ if this were the only plane. Similarly, to enforce the boundary condition at $y=0$ for the original charge, place an image charge $-q$ at $(d,-d,0)$. However, introducing both images simultaneously disturbs the other plane. To restore zero potential on both planes, reflect either image across the other plane, which adds a fourth charge at $(-d,-d,0)$ with charge $+q$ (since reflecting $-q$ across a grounded plane flips the sign again).\n\nThus, the complete set of charges is: the real $+q$ at $(d,d,0)$, and three images: $-q$ at $(-d,d,0)$, $-q$ at $(d,-d,0)$, and $+q$ at $(-d,-d,0)$.\n\nVerify the boundary conditions.

The distances to $(d,d,0)$ and $(d,-d,0)$ are equal:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{r}-(d,d,0)|=\\sqrt{(x-d)^{2}+d^{2}}=|\\mathbf{r}-(d,-d,0)|,\n$$\nand the distances to $(-d,d,0)$ and $(-d,-d,0)$ are equal:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{r}-(-d,d,0)|=\\sqrt{(x+d)^{2}+d^{2}}=|\\mathbf{r}-(-d,-d,0)|.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nV(x,0,0)=\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\left(\\frac{q}{\\sqrt{(x-d)^{2}+d^{2}}}+\\frac{-q}{\\sqrt{(x-d)^{2}+d^{2}}}+\\frac{-q}{\\sqrt{(x+d)^{2}+d^{2}}}+\\frac{q}{\\sqrt{(x+d)^{2}+d^{2}}}\\right)=0.\n$$\nHence both boundary conditions are satisfied. By the uniqueness theorem for solutions to Laplace’s and Poisson’s equations with specified Dirichlet boundary conditions, the potential in the first quadrant due to this set of charges is the unique physical solution.
