Specifically, we will use the first uniqueness theorem, which applies to problems where the potential is specified on the boundaries of a region.\n\nThe theorem states that for a volume $\\mathcal{V}$ bounded by a surface $\\mathcal{S}$, if the charge density $\\rho$ is specified everywhere inside $\\mathcal{V}$ and the potential $V$ is specified everywhere on the surface $\\mathcal{S}$, then the potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is uniquely determined at all points $\\mathbf{r}$ inside $\\mathcal{V}$.\n\nLet's apply this theorem to the given scenario.\nThe volume is $\\mathcal{V}$. The boundary surface is $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nFor the first case, the potential inside is $V_1(\\mathbf{r})$.\n1. The charge density inside $\\mathcal{V}$ is given as zero, i.e., $\\rho=0$. This means that inside $\\mathcal{V}$, the potential $V_1$ must satisfy Laplace's equation: $\\nabla^2 V_1 = 0$.\n2. The potential on the boundary surface $\\mathcal{S}$ is specified as $V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$. So, for any point $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}$ on the surface, $V_1(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nFor the second case, the potential inside is $V_2(\\mathbf{r})$.\n1. The charge density inside $\\mathcal{V}$ is also zero, so $V_2$ must also satisfy Laplace's equation: $\\nabla^2 V_2 = 0$.\n2. The problem states that the second charge distribution $\\rho_2$ is arranged to produce the same potential on the boundary. So, for any point $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}$ on the surface, $V_2(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nWe have two potentials, $V_1$ and $V_2$, that are proposed as solutions for the electrostatic potential within the volume $\\mathcal{V}$. Let's define a new potential function, $V_D(\\mathbf{r})$, as the difference between these two potentials:\n$$V_D(\\mathbf{r}) = V_1(\\mathbf{r}) - V_2(\\mathbf{r})$$\n\nNow, let's examine the properties of $V_D(\\mathbf{r})$ inside the volume $\\mathcal{V}$ and on its boundary $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nInside the volume $\\mathcal{V}$, since the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ is a linear operator, we have:\n$$\\nabla^2 V_D = \\nabla^2(V_1 - V_2) = \\nabla^2 V_1 - \\nabla^2 V_2$$\nBecause both $V_1$ and $V_2$ satisfy Laplace's equation inside $\\mathcal{V}$, we have $\\nabla^2 V_1 = 0$ and $\\nabla^2 V_2 = 0$. Therefore,\n$$\\nabla^2 V_D = 0 - 0 = 0$$\nThis means that the difference potential $V_D$ also satisfies Laplace's equation throughout the volume $\\mathcal{V}$.\n\nOn the boundary surface $\\mathcal{S}$, the value of $V_D$ is:\n$$V_D(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_1(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) - V_2(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}})$$\nFrom the problem statement, we know that on the surface $\\mathcal{S}$, $V_1(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$ and $V_2(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r})$. Thus,\n$$V_D(\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathcal{S}}) = V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r}) - V_{\\mathcal{S}}(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$$\nSo, the potential $V_D$ is zero everywhere on the boundary surface $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe now have a function, $V_D$, that satisfies Laplace's equation inside a volume and is equal to zero everywhere on the boundary of that volume. A fundamental property of solutions to Laplace's equation (which can be derived from Green's identities) is that they cannot have any local maxima or minima within the region of interest; the extreme values must occur on the boundary.\n\nIn our case, the maximum value of $V_D$ on the boundary is 0, and the minimum value of $V_D$ on the boundary is also 0. Therefore, for any point $\\mathbf{r}$ inside the volume $\\mathcal{V}$, the potential $V_D(\\mathbf{r})$ must be bounded by these extreme values:\n$$0 \\le V_D(\\mathbf{r}) \\le 0$$\nThe only way for this condition to hold is if $V_D(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$ for all points $\\mathbf{r}$ inside $\\mathcal{V}$.\n\nSince $V_D(\\mathbf{r}) = V_1(\\mathbf{r}) - V_2(\\mathbf{r})$, we have:\n$$V_1(\\mathbf{r}) - V_2(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$$\n$$V_1(\\mathbf{r}) = V_2(\\mathbf{r})$$\n\nThis shows that the two potentials must be identical everywhere inside the volume. The specific arrangement of the external charges $\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_2$ is irrelevant, as long as they produce the same boundary potential. The potential inside is uniquely determined by the boundary conditions. This corresponds to option A.
