Before we can calculate the pressure on a conductor, we often need to determine how charge distributes itself to ensure the entire surface is at an equipotential.

Initially, one sphere holds a net positive charge of $+Q$, while the other sphere is electrically neutral. The spheres are placed very far apart from each other, such that their initial electrostatic interaction is negligible. Subsequently, they are connected by a long, thin conducting wire, allowing charge to redistribute until the entire system reaches electrostatic equilibrium.\n\nDetermine the final electrostatic pressure exerted on the surface of either sphere.

Let the final charges on the two identical spheres be $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ with $q_{1}+q_{2}=Q$.
