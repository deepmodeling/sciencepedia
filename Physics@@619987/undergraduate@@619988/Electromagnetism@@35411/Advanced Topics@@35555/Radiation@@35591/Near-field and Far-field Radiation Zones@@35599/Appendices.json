The antenna has a largest linear dimension of $D = 0.500$ m and operates at a frequency of $f = 28.0$ GHz. To characterize its radiation pattern, a sensor is placed on the antenna's primary axis of radiation. A preliminary measurement is taken at a distance $r_1$ from the antenna, where the measured average power density is $S_1 = 15.0$ W/m$^2$. This distance $r_1$ is chosen to be precisely at the boundary separating the near-field and the far-field regions.

The problem states that $r_1$ is at the Fraunhofer distance, $d_f$. The formula for the Fraunhofer distance is given as $d_f = \\frac{2D^2}{\\lambda}$. To use this formula, we first need to calculate the operating wavelength $\\lambda$.

In the far-field, the power radiated from an antenna propagates as a spherical wave, and its power density $S$ follows an inverse-square law with distance $r$. This relationship can be expressed as:\n$$ S \\propto \\frac{1}{r^2} $$\nTherefore, the power densities and distances at our two measurement points ($r_1, S_1$) and ($r_2, S_2$) are related by:\n$$ S_1 r_1^2 = S_2 r_2^2 $$\n\nWe need to solve for $S_2$:\n$$ S_2 = S_1 \\left( \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\right)^2 $$\n\nNow we can substitute the known values into this equation.
