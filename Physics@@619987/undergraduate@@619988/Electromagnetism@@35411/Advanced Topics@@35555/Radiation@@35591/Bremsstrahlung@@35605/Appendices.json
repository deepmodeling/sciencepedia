The maximum possible photon frequency is $\\nu_{\\max} = K_{0}/h$. The spectral intensity is the radiated power per unit frequency interval, denoted $I(\\nu)$.\n\nFor a single bremsstrahlung interaction (thin target, Target A), the differential photon number spectrum as a function of photon energy $k=h\\nu$ is governed by the Bethe–Heitler soft-photon behavior. For $k \\ll K_{0}$, the dominant scaling of the single-collision spectrum is\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dk} \\propto \\frac{1}{k}\\,\\Phi(k,K_{0},Z),\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is a slowly varying (logarithmic) factor of order unity that depends weakly on $k$, $K_{0}$, and $Z$.

Let $E(x)$ denote the electron kinetic energy at depth $x$, with $E(0)=K_{0}$ and $E(x)$ monotonically decreasing to zero by $x_{\\max}$. The differential photon production per unit path length and per unit $k$ maintains the same soft-photon scaling when $k<h\\nu\\leq E(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^{2}N}{dk\\,dx}(E(x),k)\\propto \\frac{1}{k}\\,\\Psi(E(x),k,Z),\n$$\nwith $\\Psi$ slowly varying.

As $\\nu$ increases, the condition $E(x)\\geq h\\nu$ holds over a strictly decreasing segment of the path, shrinking monotonically to zero at $\\nu=\\nu_{\\max}$. Therefore $I_{B}(\\nu)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $\\nu$ on $0<\\nu<\\nu_{\\max}$, and $I_{B}(\\nu_{\\max})=0$. This qualitative result is consistent with the well-known Kramers law for thick-target bremsstrahlung, which gives a spectrum decreasing with $\\nu$ and vanishing at the cutoff.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Target A (thin): $I_{A}(\\nu)$ is approximately constant over a broad range $0<\\nu\\ll \\nu_{\\max}$, with only mild logarithmic variation and a cutoff near $\\nu_{\\max}$.\n- Target B (thick): $I_{B}(\\nu)$ decreases monotonically with $\\nu$ and goes to zero at $\\nu_{\\max}$; its magnitude is much larger than that of $I_{A}(\\nu)$ because electrons radiate over their entire stopping range.\n\nFinally, the cutoff frequency remains $\\nu_{\\max}=K_{0}/h$ for both targets. Even in a thick target, some electrons can emit a high-energy photon near the entrance before significant non-radiative losses, so the fundamental cutoff is unchanged. Hence, the most accurate description among the options is that $I_{A}(\\nu)$ is approximately constant while $I_{B}(\\nu)$ is monotonically decreasing.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1786646"}]}
