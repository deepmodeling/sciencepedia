The amplitude of an electric dipole moment is given by $p_0 = qd$, where $q$ is the magnitude of the effective charge and $d$ is the separation distance.\nFor molecule F1: $p_{0,1} = q_1 d_1$.\nFor molecule F2: $p_{0,2} = q_2 d_2$.\nThe problem states that the effective charge is the same for both molecules ($q_2 = q_1$) and that the charge separation for F2 is 1.5 times that for F1 ($d_2 = 1.5 d_1$).\nSubstituting these into the expression for $p_{0,2}$:\n$$\np_{0,2} = q_1 (1.5 d_1) = 1.5 (q_1 d_1) = 1.5 p_{0,1}\n$$\nTherefore, the ratio of the dipole moment amplitudes is:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{0,2}}{p_{0,1}} = 1.5\n$$\n\nNext, let's find the ratio of the angular frequencies, $\\omega_2/\\omega_1$.
