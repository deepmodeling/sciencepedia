{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "We begin our hands-on exploration with a foundational thought experiment. While we know that accelerating charges radiate, what are the precise conditions for a magnetic dipole to radiate? This exercise challenges you to think critically about the source of magnetic dipole radiation by considering a seemingly dynamic scenario—a spinning permanent magnet—that surprisingly produces no radiation. Analyzing this 'null result' is crucial for developing a deep intuition about why a time-varying magnetic dipole moment, $\\vec{m}(t)$, as observed in a fixed reference frame, is the essential ingredient for radiation.", "problem": "A cylindrically symmetric permanent magnet is made of a uniform magnetic material. Its magnetic dipole moment, $\\mathbf{m}$, is aligned perfectly with its axis of geometric symmetry. The magnet is set to spin with a constant angular velocity, $\\omega$, about this same axis of symmetry. An observer is located at rest in the laboratory frame. It is an established fact of classical electrodynamics that this particular configuration does not produce any electromagnetic radiation.\n\nWhich one of the following statements provides the correct physical explanation for the absence of radiation?\n\nA. The magnet is an electrical insulator, so the absence of free-moving charges means no currents are present to act as a source for radiation.\n\nB. The angular velocity $\\omega$ is non-relativistic. Relativistic effects are required to produce significant magnetic dipole radiation.\n\nC. The magnetic field distribution in the space surrounding the magnet is completely static from the perspective of the laboratory observer.\n\nD. The magnetic dipole moment vector $\\mathbf{m}$ is rotating in space, but its time-average over one full revolution is zero, resulting in a cancellation of any emitted radiation.\n\nE. Any emission of radiation would violate the principle of conservation of energy because there is no external agent doing work on the spinning magnet.", "solution": "We begin by recalling the radiation criteria from classical electrodynamics for localized sources. In the radiation zone, the fields are determined by time-varying multipole moments of the charge and current distributions. In particular, the magnetic dipole contribution radiates only if the magnetic dipole moment is time dependent. The far-zone radiation fields from the magnetic dipole scale with the second time derivative of the magnetic dipole moment:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{rad}},\\,\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{rad}} \\propto \\ddot{\\mathbf{m}}(t_{\\text{ret}}),\n$$\nand the radiated power in the dipole approximation is proportional to $|\\ddot{\\mathbf{m}}|^{2}$. Therefore, if $\\mathbf{m}(t)$ is constant in both magnitude and direction, the magnetic dipole does not radiate:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{m}}=\\mathbf{0},\\quad \\ddot{\\mathbf{m}}=\\mathbf{0}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\text{no magnetic dipole radiation}.\n$$\n\nNext we analyze the sources for a uniformly magnetized, rigidly rotating magnet. Let the uniform magnetization be $\\mathbf{M}=M\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, aligned with the axis of cylindrical symmetry (taken as the $z$-axis). The bound current densities associated with magnetization are\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{b}}=\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{M},\\qquad \\mathbf{K}_{\\text{b}}=\\mathbf{M}\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}.\n$$\nFor uniform $\\mathbf{M}$, $\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{M}=\\mathbf{0}$, so there is no bound volume current. On the lateral surface of the cylinder, $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$, hence\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{b}}=\\mathbf{M}\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}=M\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}.\n$$\nThis surface current density is azimuthal and, crucially, expressed in the laboratory cylindrical basis $\\{\\hat{\\mathbf{r}},\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}},\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\}$, it is independent of time. Although the material points move with angular velocity $\\omega$, the spatial distribution $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{b}}(\\mathbf{r})$ in the laboratory frame is steady because the configuration is invariant under rotations about the $z$-axis.\n\nEquivalently, one can see the invariance of the sources directly from the magnetization field under rigid rotation about the symmetry axis. If the body undergoes a rotation $R_{z}(\\omega t)$, the magnetization in the lab frame is\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{r},t)=R_{z}(\\omega t)\\,\\mathbf{M}_{\\text{body}}\\!\\left(R_{z}^{-1}(\\omega t)\\mathbf{r}\\right).\n$$\nWith $\\mathbf{M}_{\\text{body}}=M\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and $R_{z}(\\cdot)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, one finds\n$$\n\\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{r},t)=M\\hat{\\mathbf{z}},\n$$\ni.e., exactly time independent in the laboratory frame. Consequently, the total magnetic dipole moment\n$$\n\\mathbf{m}(t)=\\int \\mathbf{M}(\\mathbf{r},t)\\,d^{3}r=MV\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nis constant in both magnitude and direction. Therefore $\\dot{\\mathbf{m}}=\\ddot{\\mathbf{m}}=\\mathbf{0}$ and there is no magnetic dipole radiation.\n\nBecause the bound current distribution $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{b}}(\\mathbf{r})$ and $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{b}}(\\mathbf{r})$ are stationary in the lab frame, all electromagnetic fields $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ and $\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ are time independent solutions of Maxwell’s equations in the lab frame. A static field configuration does not have a radiative component; radiation requires time-varying sources producing time-dependent fields with a $1/r$ radiative falloff.\n\nWe now evaluate the provided options:\n- A is incorrect: even without free charges, bound currents exist and can radiate if time dependent; insulation does not preclude radiation.\n- B is incorrect: nonrelativistic rotating dipoles radiate if their dipole moment varies in time; relativity is not required for radiation.\n- C is correct: by symmetry, the source distribution and hence the external field are static in the lab frame, so there is no radiation.\n- D is incorrect: the magnetic dipole moment is not rotating; it is constant. Moreover, a zero time-average does not imply no radiation.\n- E is incorrect: radiation, if present, would drain rotational kinetic energy; no external work is needed to conserve energy.\n\nTherefore, the correct physical explanation is that the external field is static in the lab frame.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1804615"}, {"introduction": "Having established that a time-varying magnetic moment is necessary for radiation, we now investigate how the amount of radiated power depends on the source's characteristics.
