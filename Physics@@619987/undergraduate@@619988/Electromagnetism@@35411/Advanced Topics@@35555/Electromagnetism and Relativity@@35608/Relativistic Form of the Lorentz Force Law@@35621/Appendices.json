The four-force is the relativistic generalization of the Newtonian three-force. Its components are related to the ordinary three-force $\\vec{f}$ and the rate of change of the particle's energy.\n\nThe four-force $K^\\mu$ is defined as the rate of change of the four-momentum $P^\\mu$ with respect to the proper time $\\tau$, i.e., $K^\\mu = \\frac{dP^\\mu}{d\\tau}$. In terms of the three-force $\\vec{f}$ and the particle's velocity $\\vec{v}$, the components of the four-force vector $K^\\mu = (K^0, K^1, K^2, K^3)$ can be written as:\n$$ K^\\mu = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{\\vec{f} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{c}, \\vec{f}\\right) $$\nHere, $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - |\\vec{v}|^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor, and $c$ is the speed of light. The time component $K^0$ represents the rate of change of energy (power) scaled by $c$, and the spatial components $(K^1, K^2, K^3)$ are the relativistic three-force.\n\nFirst, we need to find the ordinary three-force $\\vec{f}$ acting on the particle. The force on a charged particle in electric and magnetic fields is given by the Lorentz force law:\n$$ \\vec{f} = q(\\vec{E} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B}) $$\nIn this problem, the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is zero. The electric field is given as $\\vec{E} = E_0 \\hat{x}$. Therefore, the three-force is:\n$$ \\vec{f} = q\\vec{E} = qE_0 \\hat{x} $$\nIn component form, this is $\\vec{f} = (qE_0, 0, 0)$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the state of the particle at the initial time $t=0$. The initial velocity is given as $\\vec{v} = v_0 \\hat{y}$.

We need to calculate the dot product $\\vec{f} \\cdot \\vec{v}$:\n$$ \\vec{f} \\cdot \\vec{v} = (qE_0 \\hat{x}) \\cdot (v_0 \\hat{y}) $$\nSince the unit vectors $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{y}$ are orthogonal, their dot product is zero: $\\hat{x} \\cdot \\hat{y} = 0$.\nTherefore, the power delivered to the particle at this instant is zero:\n$$ \\vec{f} \\cdot \\vec{v} = 0 $$\nThis implies that the time component of the four-force is also zero:\n$$ K^0 = \\gamma \\frac{0}{c} = 0 $$\nPhysically, this means that at the initial moment, the force is perpendicular to the velocity, so the particle's kinetic energy is not changing at that exact instant.\n\nFinally, we assemble the components into the four-force column vector $K^\\mu$:\n$$ K^\\mu = \\begin{pmatrix} K^0 \\\\ K^1 \\\\ K^2 \\\\ K^3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\gamma qE_0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\gamma$, we get the final answer:\n$$ K^\\mu = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{q E_0}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_0^2}{c^2}}} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{q E_0}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v_0^2}{c^2}}} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "1817525"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the previous scenario, we now introduce both electric and magnetic fields to explore a more complex interaction.
