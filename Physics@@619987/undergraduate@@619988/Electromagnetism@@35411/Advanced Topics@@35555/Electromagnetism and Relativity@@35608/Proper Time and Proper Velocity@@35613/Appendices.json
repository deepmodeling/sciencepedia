Initially, its relativistic kinetic energy is measured to be $K_1 = mc^2$. After passing through an accelerating cavity, its final kinetic energy is measured to be $K_2 = 8mc^2$, where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nIn special relativity, the motion of a particle is often described by its 4-velocity (also known as proper velocity), $\\eta^{\\mu}$. This is the rate of change of the particle's spacetime position four-vector, $x^{\\mu} = (ct, \\vec{x})$, with respect to the proper time $\\tau$ of the particle, such that $\\eta^{\\mu} = \\frac{dx^{\\mu}}{d\\tau}$.

Express your answer as an exact value.", "solution": "The solution involves finding the relationship between a particle's kinetic energy and the magnitude of the spatial part of its proper velocity. We will first determine the initial and final Lorentz factors from the given kinetic energies. Then, we will establish an expression for the magnitude of the spatial proper velocity, $|\\vec{\\eta}|$, in terms of the Lorentz factor. Finally, we will compute the ratio of the final to the initial value of $|\\vec{\\eta}|$.\n\nThe relativistic kinetic energy, $K$, of a particle with rest mass $m$ is given by the total energy $E$ minus the rest energy $mc^2$:\n$$K = E - mc^2$$\nThe total energy is related to the rest mass and the Lorentz factor, $\\gamma$, by $E = \\gamma mc^2$. Thus, the kinetic energy is:\n$$K = \\gamma mc^2 - mc^2 = (\\gamma - 1)mc^2$$\n\nFirst, we find the initial Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_1$, corresponding to the initial kinetic energy $K_1 = mc^2$.\n$$K_1 = (\\gamma_1 - 1)mc^2$$\n$$mc^2 = (\\gamma_1 - 1)mc^2$$\nDividing by $mc^2$ (which is non-zero), we get:\n$$1 = \\gamma_1 - 1 \\implies \\gamma_1 = 2$$\n\nNext, we find the final Lorentz factor, $\\gamma_2$, corresponding to the final kinetic energy $K_2 = 8mc^2$.\n$$K_2 = (\\gamma_2 - 1)mc^2$$\n$$8mc^2 = (\\gamma_2 - 1)mc^2$$\nDividing by $mc^2$:\n$$8 = \\gamma_2 - 1 \\implies \\gamma_2 = 9$$\n\nNow, we need to find an expression for the magnitude of the spatial part of the proper velocity, $|\\vec{\\eta}|$. The 4-velocity is $\\eta^{\\mu} = (\\eta^0, \\vec{\\eta})$, where $\\eta^0$ is the time component and $\\vec{\\eta}$ are the spatial components.
