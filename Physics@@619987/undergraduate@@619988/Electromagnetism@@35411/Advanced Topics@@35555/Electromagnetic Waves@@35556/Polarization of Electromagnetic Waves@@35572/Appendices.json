Linear polarizers are essential tools for this purpose, selectively transmitting light of a particular orientation. This problem explores the application of Malus's Law, which governs the intensity of light passing through polarizers, in a classic three-polarizer setup [@problem_id:1813434]. Working through this scenario will build your intuition for how light intensity can be precisely controlled, revealing some surprising results about how light interacts with seemingly blocking filters.", "problem": "An optical engineering student is designing a system to control a photochemical reaction. The setup involves a beam of unpolarized light, with an initial intensity of $I_0$, passing through a sequence of three ideal linear polarizers, labeled P1, P2, and P3. The first polarizer, P1, has its transmission axis oriented vertically. The third polarizer, P3, has its transmission axis oriented horizontally. The middle polarizer, P2, is placed between P1 and P3, and its transmission axis is oriented at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical. The light that emerges from this three-polarizer system is then used to initiate the photochemical reaction. The rate of the reaction, denoted by $R$, has been experimentally determined to be directly proportional to the square of the final transmitted light intensity, $I_f$. That is, $R = c I_f^2$, where $c$ is a positive constant of proportionality.\n\nTo achieve the fastest reaction, the student needs to orient the middle polarizer P2 appropriately. Determine the angle $\\theta$, within the range $0^{\\circ} < \\theta < 90^{\\circ}$, that maximizes the rate of the photochemical reaction. Express your answer in degrees.", "solution": "Let the incident light be unpolarized with intensity $I_{0}$.
