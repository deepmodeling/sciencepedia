This foundational exercise guides you through determining the pressure from a laser beam, considering that real-world surfaces are often partially reflective and partially absorbing.

A continuous-wave laser emits a cylindrical beam of light with a total power $P$. The beam has a uniform intensity distribution across its circular cross-section of radius $r$. This beam is directed to strike a flat surface at normal incidence. The material of the surface is partially reflective, with a reflectivity $R$, which is defined as the fraction of the incident light intensity that is reflected specularly. The remaining fraction of the light is absorbed by the material. For the purpose of assessing potential mechanical stress on the component, your task is to determine the radiation pressure exerted by the laser beam on the surface.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the radiation pressure, $P_{rad}$, on the surface. Your expression should be in terms of the laser power $P$, beam radius $r$, surface reflectivity $R$, and the speed of light in vacuum $c$.", "solution": "Radiation pressure is the normal force per unit area due to momentum transfer from the electromagnetic wave to the surface. For an incident intensity $I$, the momentum flux of the wave is $I/c$. For a perfectly absorbing surface, the pressure equals $I/c$, because absorbed energy flux $I$ deposits momentum flux $I/c$. For a perfectly reflecting surface at normal incidence, the pressure equals $2I/c$, because the normal component of photon momentum reverses, giving a change $2p$ per photon.\n\nFor a surface with reflectivity $R$ and no transmission, the incident intensity $I$ splits into a reflected part $I_{\\text{ref}}=RI$ and an absorbed part $I_{\\text{abs}}=(1-R)I$.

This problem uses the impulse-momentum theorem, a cornerstone of classical mechanics, to find the final velocity of a small 'solar sail' after being struck by a pulse of light.
