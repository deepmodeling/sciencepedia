The field satisfies both of Gauss's laws, but it is impossible to satisfy both Faraday's Law and the Ampere-Maxwell Law simultaneously.", "solution": "We are asked to determine which of Maxwell's equations are violated by the proposed longitudinal electric field $\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t) = E_0 f(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z}$ in a vacuum. Let the argument of the function $f$ be $u = kz - \\omega t$.\n\n**Step 1: Test Gauss's Law for Electricity ($\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$)**\n\nThe divergence of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ in Cartesian coordinates is given by $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial z}$.\nFor the given field, $E_x=0$, $E_y=0$, and $E_z = E_0 f(kz - \\omega t)$.\nThe divergence is therefore:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left[ E_0 f(kz - \\omega t) \\right] $$\nUsing the chain rule, where $f'(u)$ is the derivative of $f$ with respect to its argument $u$:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = E_0 f'(u) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) \\cdot k = k E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) $$\nSince the waveform $f$ is non-constant, its derivative $f'(u)$ is not identically zero. Also, for a wave to exist, $k \\neq 0$ and $E_0 \\neq 0$. Thus, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} \\neq 0$.\nThis means the proposed electric field violates Gauss's Law for electricity in a vacuum. This immediately eliminates options A, C, and E.\n\n**Step 2: Test the Curl-based Laws (Faraday's and Ampere-Maxwell)**\n\nFirst, let's analyze Faraday's Law of Induction: $\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}$. We need to compute the curl of $\\vec{E}$.\nThe curl of $\\vec{E}$ in Cartesian coordinates is:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial z}\\right)\\hat{x} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial x}\\right)\\hat{y} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y}\\right)\\hat{z} $$\nSince $E_x = E_y = 0$ and $E_z$ is a function of only $z$ and $t$, the derivatives $\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial x}$ and $\\frac{\\partial E_z}{\\partial y}$ are both zero.\nTherefore, every component of the curl is zero:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = \\vec{0} $$\nFor Faraday's Law ($\\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}$) to be satisfied, we must have $-\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t} = \\vec{0}$. This implies that the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ must be static (i.e., time-independent), so $\\vec{B} = \\vec{B}(\\vec{r})$. Faraday's Law itself is not necessarily violated; it simply imposes a condition on $\\vec{B}$.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Ampere-Maxwell Law ($\\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}$)**\n\nNow let's examine the consistency with the Ampere-Maxwell Law. A fundamental theorem of vector calculus states that the divergence of the curl of any vector field is identically zero. That is, for any vector field $\\vec{A}$, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\vec{A}) = 0$.\nIf the Ampere-Maxwell Law a is to hold, then the divergence of its right-hand side must also be zero:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}\\right) = 0 $$\nLet's compute the time derivative of $\\vec{E}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left[ E_0 f(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z} \\right] = E_0 f'(u) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\hat{z} = -\\omega E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z} $$\nNow, let's take the divergence of this expression:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\nabla \\cdot \\left[ -\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) \\hat{z} \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left[ -\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 f'(kz - \\omega t) \\right] $$\nApplying the chain rule again, where $f''(u)$ is the second derivative:\n$$ = -\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega E_0 f''(u) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = -\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\omega k E_0 f''(kz - \\omega t) $$\nSince the wave profile $f(u)$ is arbitrary and non-constant, its second derivative $f''(u)$ is not generally zero. All other constants are non-zero.\nThus, $\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\vec{E}}{\\partial t}\\right) \\neq 0$.\nThis leads to a contradiction. The Ampere-Maxwell Law requires $\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}$ to be equal to a vector field whose divergence is non-zero. However, the divergence of a curl is always zero. This means it is mathematically impossible to find any vector field $\\vec{B}$ that satisfies the Ampere-Maxwell Law for the given $\\vec{E}$. The law is therefore fundamentally violated.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe proposed electric field violates Gauss's Law for electricity because its divergence is non-zero. It also violates the Ampere-Maxwell law because the right-hand side, $\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial\\vec{E}}{\\partial t}$, has a non-zero divergence and thus cannot be represented as the curl of any magnetic field $\\vec{B}$.\n\nThis corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1592426"}, {"introduction": "Having established that electromagnetic waves are transverse, we now turn to the dynamic relationship between the electric and magnetic fields.
