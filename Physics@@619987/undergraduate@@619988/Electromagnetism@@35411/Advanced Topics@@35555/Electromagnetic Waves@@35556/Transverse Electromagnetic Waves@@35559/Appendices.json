When a wave interacts with a surface, this transfer of momentum results in a force, a phenomenon known as radiation pressure.

The rotor consists of a rigid, massless rod of total length $2L$ that is free to rotate without friction about its center. At one end of the rod, a small, thin, perfectly absorbing square vane of side $a$ and mass $m$ is attached. At the opposite end, an identical vane in terms of mass and dimensions is attached, but this vane is perfectly reflecting. The rotor is initially at rest, with the surfaces of the vanes oriented perpendicular to the direction of an incoming light beam.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the entire apparatus is uniformly illuminated by a steady beam of light with a constant intensity $I$. The light travels in a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation and normal to the initial surface orientation of the vanes. Let $c$ be the speed of light in vacuum. For the purpose of calculating the moment of inertia, you may treat the vanes as point masses located at a distance $L$ from the pivot.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the initial angular acceleration of the rotor immediately after the light is turned on.
