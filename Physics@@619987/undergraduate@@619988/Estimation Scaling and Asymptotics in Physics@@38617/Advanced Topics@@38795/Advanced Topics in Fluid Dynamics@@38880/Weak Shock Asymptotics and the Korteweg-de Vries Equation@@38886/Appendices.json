We are given the corresponding speeds for a canonical form of the KdV equation, $v_t + v v_x + v_{xxx} = 0$. The key is to find a scaling transformation that maps one equation to the other.\n\nLet's assume a general scaling transformation relating the variables of the two systems:\n$$ u(x,t) = \\alpha v(x',t') $$\n$$ x = \\beta x' $$\n$$ t = \\gamma t' $$\nwhere $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ are scaling constants.\n\nWe need to express the derivatives of $u$ with respect to $(x,t)$ in terms of derivatives of $v$ with respect to $(x',t')$.
