This exercise is a cornerstone of turbulence theory, challenging you to bridge the macroscopic and microscopic worlds. By using fundamental scaling arguments [@problem_id:1911137], you will derive a powerful relationship that reveals how the size of the smallest eddies is dictated by the overall size and speed of the flow, encapsulated by the Reynolds number $Re$.", "problem": "In the study of turbulence, a central concept is Richardson's energy cascade, where energy is transferred from large-scale motions to progressively smaller scales (eddies) without significant loss, until a scale is reached where viscous forces become dominant and dissipate the kinetic energy into heat. This smallest, dissipative scale is known as the Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$.\n\nConsider a large, industrial chemical reactor where a fluid of constant kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ is stirred vigorously. The stirring mechanism, with a characteristic size $L$ and velocity $U$, injects energy into the fluid at the largest scales. This energy creates turbulent eddies. Let $\\epsilon$ be the rate of energy dissipation per unit mass. In the inertial subrange of turbulence, $\\epsilon$ is assumed to be constant and equal to the rate at which energy is supplied at the large scales. Based on dimensional analysis of the large-scale parameters, the energy injection rate per unit mass can be estimated as being proportional to $U^3/L$.\n\nAt the Kolmogorov scale $\\eta$, the characteristic velocity of the eddies is $u_\\eta$. Viscous effects become dominant at this scale, and the dissipation rate per unit mass, $\\epsilon$, is determined by the local velocity gradients. This dissipation rate is proportional to $\\nu$ times the square of the characteristic velocity gradient at that scale. The criterion defining the Kolmogorov scale is that the local Reynolds number, $Re_\\eta = \\frac{u_\\eta \\eta}{\\nu}$, is on the order of unity.\n\nThe macroscopic state of the flow is characterized by the bulk Reynolds number, defined as $Re = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$. Based on these scaling arguments, derive a symbolic expression for the ratio of the Kolmogorov length to the macroscopic length, $\\frac{\\eta}{L}$, solely as a function of the macroscopic Reynolds number $Re$.", "solution": "The problem requires us to derive the relationship between the Kolmogorov length scale $\\eta$, the macroscopic length scale $L$, and the macroscopic Reynolds number $Re$. We are given several physical principles and definitions based on Kolmogorov's theory of turbulence.\n\nStep 1: Express the energy dissipation rate per unit mass, $\\epsilon$, in terms of both large-scale and small-scale parameters.\n\nAccording to the problem description, the energy injection rate at the large scales, which equals the dissipation rate $\\epsilon$ in the steady state, is proportional to the large-scale parameters $U$ and $L$.\n$$ \\epsilon \\propto \\frac{U^3}{L} $$\nWe can write this as a scaling relation:\n$$ \\epsilon \\sim \\frac{U^3}{L} \\quad (1) $$\n\nAt the small, dissipative Kolmogorov scale $\\eta$, the energy dissipation is due to viscous forces. The problem states that $\\epsilon$ is proportional to the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ and the square of the characteristic velocity gradient. The characteristic velocity at scale $\\eta$ is $u_\\eta$, so the velocity gradient is on the order of $u_\\eta / \\eta$.\n$$ \\epsilon \\propto \\nu \\left( \\frac{u_\\eta}{\\eta} \\right)^2 $$\nAs a scaling relation:\n$$ \\epsilon \\sim \\nu \\frac{u_\\eta^2}{\\eta^2} \\quad (2) $$\n\nStep 2: Equate the expressions for $\\epsilon$ and use the definition of the Kolmogorov scale.\n\nThe core idea of the energy cascade is that the rate of energy transfer is constant across the inertial scales. Therefore, the rate of injection at the large scales must equal the rate of dissipation at the small scales. Equating the scaling relations (1) and (2):\n$$ \\frac{U^3}{L} \\sim \\nu \\frac{u_\\eta^2}{\\eta^2} \\quad (3) $$\n\nNext, we use the defining condition for the Kolmogorov scale, which is that the local Reynolds number is of order one.\n$$ Re_\\eta = \\frac{u_\\eta \\eta}{\\nu} \\sim 1 $$\nThis allows us to express the small-scale velocity $u_\\eta$ in terms of $\\eta$ and $\\nu$:\n$$ u_\\eta \\sim \\frac{\\nu}{\\eta} \\quad (4) $$\n\nStep 3: Solve for the Kolmogorov length $\\eta$.\n\nWe now have a system of relations and want to find $\\eta$ in terms of the macroscopic quantities $U$, $L$, and $\\nu$. We can substitute the expression for $u_\\eta$ from (4) into equation (3).\n$$ \\frac{U^3}{L} \\sim \\nu \\frac{1}{\\eta^2} \\left( \\frac{\\nu}{\\eta} \\right)^2 = \\nu \\frac{\\nu^2}{\\eta^4} = \\frac{\\nu^3}{\\eta^4} $$\nNow, we can solve for $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta^4 \\sim \\frac{\\nu^3 L}{U^3} $$\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives $\\eta$ in terms of the primary variables:\n$$ \\eta \\sim \\left( \\frac{\\nu^3 L}{U^3} \\right)^{1/4} = \\nu^{3/4} L^{1/4} U^{-3/4} \\quad (5) $$\n\nStep 4: Express the result in terms of the macroscopic Reynolds number $Re$.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{\\eta}{L}$ as a function of the macroscopic Reynolds number $Re = \\frac{UL}{\\nu}$. To do this, we need to eliminate $U$ and $\\nu$ from our expression for $\\eta$ in favor of $Re$. First, let's rearrange the expression for $\\eta$ to form the desired ratio $\\frac{\\eta}{L}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta}{L} \\sim \\frac{\\nu^{3/4} L^{1/4} U^{-3/4}}{L} = \\nu^{3/4} L^{-3/4} U^{-3/4} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\eta}{L} \\sim \\left( \\frac{\\nu}{LU} \\right)^{3/4} $$\nWe can see that the term inside the parenthesis is the inverse of the macroscopic Reynolds number:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu}{LU} = \\left( \\frac{UL}{\\nu} \\right)^{-1} = Re^{-1} $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\frac{\\eta}{L}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta}{L} \\sim (Re^{-1})^{3/4} = Re^{-3/4} $$\nThus, the ratio of the Kolmogorov length scale to the macroscopic length scale scales as the macroscopic Reynolds number to the power of $-3/4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{Re^{-3/4}}$$", "id": "1911137"}, {"introduction": "Having established the relationship between the largest and smallest scales in a turbulent flow, we now turn to the distribution of energy within the cascade.
