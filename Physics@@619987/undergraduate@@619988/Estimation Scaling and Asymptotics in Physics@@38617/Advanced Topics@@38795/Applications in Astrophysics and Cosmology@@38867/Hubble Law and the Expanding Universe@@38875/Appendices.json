This redshift is a direct consequence of the expansion of the universe, which stretches the wavelength of photons as they travel through space. A photon is emitted from this quasar and travels across the cosmos until it is detected by a telescope on Earth. By what factor has the wavelength of this photon been stretched during its journey? Provide your answer as a single number.", "solution": "The problem asks for the factor by which a photon's wavelength has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe, given the cosmological redshift $z$ of its source. Let the wavelength of the photon at the time of emission be $\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}$ and the wavelength observed on Earth be $\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}$.\n\nThe cosmological redshift, $z$, is defined by the fractional change in wavelength:\n$$z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}} - \\lambda_{\\text{emit}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}}$$\nThis equation relates the observed and emitted wavelengths to the redshift.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"factor\" by which the wavelength has been stretched.

Rearranging this, the factor is given by the ratio of the observed wavelength to the emitted wavelength:\n$$F = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}}$$\n\nWe can now use the definition of redshift to find an expression for this factor $F$. Let's rearrange the redshift formula:\n$$z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}} - \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}}$$\n$$z = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}} - 1$$\nSubstituting our definition of the factor $F$ into this equation, we get:\n$$z = F - 1$$\nSolving for $F$, we find:\n$$F = 1 + z$$\n\nThis result shows that the wavelength of a photon is stretched by a factor of $1+z$ when it travels from a source at redshift $z$.\n\nPhysically, this stretching is a direct result of the expansion of space itself. The ratio of the wavelengths is equal to the ratio of the scale factor of the universe at the time of observation ($a_{\\text{obs}}$) to the scale factor at the time of emission ($a_{\\text{emit}}$):\n$$\\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{obs}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{emit}}} = \\frac{a_{\\text{obs}}}{a_{\\text{emit}}}$$\nThe scale factor and redshift are related by definition as $1+z = \\frac{a_{\\text{obs}}}{a_{\\text{emit}}}$. Therefore, we can directly see that the stretching factor is $F = 1+z$.\n\nThe problem states that the quasar has a redshift of $z=5$. We can now calculate the numerical value of the factor $F$:\n$$F = 1 + 5$$\n$$F = 6$$\n\nThus, the wavelength of the photon has been stretched by a factor of 6.
