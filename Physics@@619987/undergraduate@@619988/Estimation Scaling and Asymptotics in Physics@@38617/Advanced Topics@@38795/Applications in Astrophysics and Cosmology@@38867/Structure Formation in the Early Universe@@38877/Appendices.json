In the subsequent period, often called the cosmic \"dark ages,\" this baryonic gas exists as a neutral, diffuse medium. We can model this gas as a monatomic ideal gas. As the universe expands, this gas cools. Consider a simplified model where the only thermal process affecting the gas is the adiabatic cooling due to the uniform expansion of the universe.\n\nThe expansion of the universe is described by a scale factor $a(t)$. The cosmological redshift, $z$, is related to the scale factor at a given time, $a$, and the scale factor today, $a_0$, by the relation $1+z = a_0/a$.\n\nLet $T_b(z)$ be the temperature of the baryonic gas at a redshift $z$.

Express your answer in terms of $T_{b,0}$, $z$, and $z_0$.", "solution": "The problem states that the baryonic gas cools adiabatically as the universe expands. For an adiabatic process involving an ideal gas, the relationship between temperature $T$ and volume $V$ is given by:\n$$T V^{\\gamma-1} = C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant and $\\gamma$ is the adiabatic index or heat capacity ratio, defined as $\\gamma = C_P / C_V$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the baryonic gas is to be modeled as a monatomic ideal gas. For a monatomic gas, there are three translational degrees of freedom, so the molar heat capacity at constant volume is $C_V = \\frac{3}{2}R$, where $R$ is the ideal gas constant. The molar heat capacity at constant pressure is $C_P = C_V + R = \\frac{3}{2}R + R = \\frac{5}{2}R$.\nTherefore, the adiabatic index $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V} = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2}R}{\\frac{3}{2}R} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\nNow, we need to relate the volume $V$ of a portion of the gas to the cosmological scale factor $a$. A comoving volume in an expanding universe has its physical volume scale with the cube of the scale factor. Thus, we can write the volume of a fixed amount of gas as:\n$$V \\propto a^3$$\nSubstituting this into the adiabatic relation, we get:\n$$T_b (a^3)^{\\gamma-1} = \\text{constant}$$\n$$T_b a^{3(\\gamma-1)} = \\text{constant}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\gamma = 5/3$:\n$$3(\\gamma-1) = 3\\left(\\frac{5}{3} - 1\\right) = 3\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 2$$\nSo the temperature scaling relation becomes:\n$$T_b a^2 = \\text{constant}$$\nThis implies that the temperature of the baryonic gas is inversely proportional to the square of the scale factor:\n$$T_b \\propto a^{-2}$$\n\nNext, we relate the scale factor $a$ to the redshift $z$. The problem provides the definition $1+z = a_0/a$, where $a_0$ is the scale factor today. We can rearrange this to express $a$ in terms of $z$:\n$$a = \\frac{a_0}{1+z}$$\nSubstituting this into our temperature scaling relation:\n$$T_b \\propto \\left(\\frac{a_0}{1+z}\\right)^{-2} \\propto \\frac{(1+z)^2}{a_0^2}$$\nSince $a_0$ is a constant, we find the scaling of temperature with redshift:\n$$T_b \\propto (1+z)^2$$\n\nTo find the exact expression relating the temperature $T_b(z)$ at redshift $z$ to the temperature $T_{b,0}$ at a reference redshift $z_0$, we can set up a ratio:\n$$\\frac{T_b(z)}{T_{b,0}} = \\frac{k(1+z)^2}{k(1+z_0)^2}$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\n$$\\frac{T_b(z)}{T_{b,0}} = \\left(\\frac{1+z}{1+z_0}\\right)^2$$\nFinally, solving for $T_b(z)$, we get the desired expression:\n$$T_b(z) = T_{b,0} \\left( \\frac{1+z}{1+z_0} \\right)^2$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T_{b,0} \\left( \\frac{1+z}{1+z_0} \\right)^{2}}$$", "id": "1935712"}, {"introduction": "Gravity drives structure formation, but it must first overcome the gas's internal pressure, which resists compression.
