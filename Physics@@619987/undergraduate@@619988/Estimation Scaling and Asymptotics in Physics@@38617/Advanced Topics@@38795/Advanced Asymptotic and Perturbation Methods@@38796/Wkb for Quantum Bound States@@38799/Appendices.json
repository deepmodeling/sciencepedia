We can use the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) approximation to find the quantized energy levels.\n\nThe potential is a V-shaped well with its minimum at $x=0$, where $V(0) = -V_0$, and its maximum value within the finite region is $V(\\pm a) = 0$. For low-lying bound states, the energy $E$ will be close to the minimum of the potential, so $-V_0 < E < 0$. The classical turning points, $x_{tp}$, are where the kinetic energy is zero, i.e., $E = V(x_{tp})$.\n$$E = V_0 \\left( \\frac{|x_{tp}|}{a} - 1 \\right)$$\nSolving for $|x_{tp}|$:\n$$\\frac{|x_{tp}|}{a} = \\frac{E}{V_0} + 1 \\implies |x_{tp}| = a\\left(1 + \\frac{E}{V_0}\\right)$$\nSince we are considering low-lying states with $E<0$, the turning points $|x_{tp}|$ are less than $a$. This means the particle is classically confined to the region $[-x_{tp}, x_{tp}]$ which is well within the infinite well boundaries at $x=\\pm a$.
