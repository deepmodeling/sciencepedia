The spring initially has a spring constant $k_0$. The particle is set into oscillation in a uniform gravitational field characterized by the acceleration due to gravity $g$. The initial amplitude of these oscillations, measured from the particle's equilibrium position, is $A_0$.\n\nThe physical properties of the spring are then altered slowly, such that its spring constant $k(t)$ changes over a very long period of time. This change is considered *adiabatic*, which implies that the fractional change in the spring constant over a single period of oscillation is negligible. At the end of this process, the spring constant has reached a final value of $2k_0$.\n\nDerive the ratio of the final oscillation amplitude $A_f$ to the initial amplitude $A_0$, i.e., find the value of $\\frac{A_f}{A_0}$.", "solution": "Let $y$ be the vertical displacement of the mass $m$ from the position where the spring is unstretched.
