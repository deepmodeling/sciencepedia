The effective force is the negative gradient of the effective potential, $F_{\\text{eff}} = -dV_{\\text{eff}}/dr$.\n\nFirst, we find the condition for a circular orbit by setting the first derivative of the effective potential with respect to $r$ to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dV_{\\text{eff}}}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( -\\frac{GMm}{r} + \\frac{L^2}{2mr^2} - \\frac{GML^2}{c^2mr^3} \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{GMm}{r^2} - \\frac{L^2}{mr^3} + \\frac{3GML^2}{c^2mr^4} = 0 $$\nThis equation relates the angular momentum $L$ to the radius $r$ for any circular orbit.
