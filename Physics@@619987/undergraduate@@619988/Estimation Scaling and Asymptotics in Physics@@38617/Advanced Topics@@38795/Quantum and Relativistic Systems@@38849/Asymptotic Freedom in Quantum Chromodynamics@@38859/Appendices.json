This exercise provides a glimpse into the rich and complex landscape of QCD beyond the leading-order approximations.", "problem": "In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions, many physical observables at a high energy scale, characterized by momentum transfer squared $Q^2$, receive contributions from different physical mechanisms. Consider an observable that has a perturbative contribution from a third-order process, whose magnitude scales as $P(Q^2) = A \\cdot \\alpha_s(Q^2)^3$, and a non-perturbative contribution from an instanton effect, which scales as $N(Q^2) = B \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\alpha_s(Q^2)}\\right)$.

A physical solution for the crossover scale $Q_c$ requires that the corresponding coupling constant $\\alpha_s(Q_c^2)$ be real and positive.\n\nA crossover between these two types of contributions is not guaranteed to exist for all possible values of the prefactors $A$ and $B$. A physical crossover scale $Q_c > \\Lambda_{\\text{QCD}}$ can only be found if the dimensionless ratio of the prefactors, $C = B/A$, is greater than or equal to a certain minimum critical value, $C_{min}$.\n\nYour task is to determine a closed-form analytic expression for this minimum critical value $C_{min}$. Your final expression should only involve fundamental mathematical constants.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum value of the ratio of prefactors, $C=B/A$, for which a crossover scale $Q_c$ exists. The crossover condition is given by the equality of the perturbative and non-perturbative contributions:\n$$P(Q_c^2) = N(Q_c^2)$$\nSubstituting the given scaling laws for $P(Q^2)$ and $N(Q^2)$:\n$$A \\cdot \\alpha_s(Q_c^2)^3 = B \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\alpha_s(Q_c^2)}\\right)$$\nLet $\\alpha_s \\equiv \\alpha_s(Q_c^2)$ be the value of the strong coupling constant at the crossover scale.

The existence of such a solution depends on the possible values that the function on the right-hand side can take. Let's define this function:\n$$f(\\alpha_s) = \\alpha_s^3 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\alpha_s}\\right)$$\nThe problem of finding a crossover is now equivalent to finding a solution to the equation $C = f(\\alpha_s)$. A solution exists if and only if $C$ is within the range of the function $f(\\alpha_s)$. Since we are looking for the *minimum* value of $C$ for which a solution exists, we need to find the minimum value of the function $f(\\alpha_s)$ for its physical domain, which is $\\alpha_s > 0$.\n\nTo find the minimum value of $f(\\alpha_s)$, we compute its derivative with respect to $\\alpha_s$ and set it to zero.

Since $\\alpha_s > 0$ and $\\exp(2\\pi/\\alpha_s) > 0$, the only way for the derivative to be zero is if the term in the parenthesis is zero:\n$$3\\alpha_s - 2\\pi = 0$$\nSolving for $\\alpha_s$, we find the critical value:\n$$\\alpha_s^* = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$$\nTo determine if this critical point corresponds to a minimum, we can examine the sign of the derivative $f'(\\alpha_s)$ around $\\alpha_s^*$.\n- For $0 < \\alpha_s < 2\\pi/3$, the term $(3\\alpha_s - 2\\pi)$ is negative, so $f'(\\alpha_s) < 0$. The function is decreasing.\n- For $\\alpha_s > 2\\pi/3$, the term $(3\\alpha_s - 2\\pi)$ is positive, so $f'(\\alpha_s) > 0$. The function is increasing.\nThis confirms that $\\alpha_s^* = 2\\pi/3$ corresponds to a local minimum of the function $f(\\alpha_s)$. Since this is the only critical point for $\\alpha_s > 0$, and the function tends to infinity as $\\alpha_s \\to 0^+$ and as $\\alpha_s \\to \\infty$, this is the global minimum.\n\nThe minimum value of the function $f(\\alpha_s)$ is therefore $f(\\alpha_s^*)$:\n$$f_{min} = f\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right)^3 \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2\\pi/3}\\right)$$\n$$f_{min} = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{27} \\exp\\left(3\\right)$$\nFor the equation $C = f(\\alpha_s)$ to have a solution, the value of $C$ must be greater than or equal to this minimum value.\n$$C \\ge f_{min}$$\nTherefore, the minimum critical value for the ratio of prefactors, $C_{min}$, is precisely the minimum value of the function $f(\\alpha_s)$.\n$$C_{min} = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{27} \\exp(3)$$\nThis expression for $C_{min}$ depends only on the mathematical constants $\\pi$ and $e$, as required. The existence of a crossover depends on the strength of the non-perturbative prefactor relative to the perturbative one, but not on the specific parameters of QCD ($N_c, N_f, \\Lambda_{QCD}$), because the condition is on $\\alpha_s$ itself, not on the corresponding $Q^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{8\\pi^{3}}{27}\\exp(3)}$$", "id": "1884381"}]}
