Lighter nuclei must overcome the strong electrostatic repulsion (the Coulomb barrier) of other nuclei to get close enough for the strong nuclear force to initiate fusion. The probability of this occurring is highly dependent on the mass of the tunneling particle.\n\nConsider a simplified one-dimensional scenario involving a proton and a deuteron. A proton has mass $m_p$ and a deuteron, the nucleus of a deuterium atom, has mass $m_d$. Both particles approach an identical electrostatic potential barrier, described by a potential energy function $V(x)$, with the same initial kinetic energy $E$, where $E$ is less than the maximum height of the barrier.\n\nFor the purpose of this estimation, you may assume that the mass of a deuteron is exactly twice the mass of a proton, i.e., $m_d = 2m_p$.\n\nThe tunneling probability, $T$, for a particle of mass $m$ can be estimated by the dominant exponential factor from the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, which is given by:\n$$\nT \\approx \\exp\\left( -\\frac{2}{\\hbar} \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} \\sqrt{2m(V(x)-E)} \\, dx \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and the integral is performed over the classically forbidden region $[x_1, x_2]$ where $V(x) > E$.\n\nLet $T_p$ be the tunneling probability for the proton and $T_d$ be the tunneling probability for the deuteron.
