These five smaller shapes are scaled-down copies of the Stage 0 initiator, each reduced by a linear scaling factor of $S = 1/3$ relative to the parent shape they are replacing. The five smaller shapes are arranged in the same plus-sign pattern within the boundaries of the parent shape; one is placed at the center, and the other four are placed at the extremities where the arms of the parent shape were located.\n\nThis iterative process is repeated indefinitely to form the final fractal. Calculate the similarity dimension, $D$, of the resulting Hierarchical Cross.

For a self-similar object that is composed of $N$ non-overlapping copies of itself, each scaled by a linear factor of $S$ (where $S < 1$), the similarity dimension is given by the formula:\n$$D = \\frac{\\ln(N)}{\\ln(1/S)}$$\nTo solve the problem, we must identify the values of $N$ and $S$ from the description of the Hierarchical Cross.\n\nFirst, we determine $N$, the number of self-similar copies that make up the object at the next level of magnification. The problem states, \"every plus-sign shape from Stage $k$ is replaced by a set of five smaller plus-sign shapes.\" This means that the fractal is composed of 5 self-similar pieces. Therefore, $N = 5$.\n\nNext, we determine $S$, the linear scaling factor for each of these copies. The problem explicitly states that each of the smaller shapes is \"reduced by a linear scaling factor of $S = 1/3$ relative to the parent shape they are replacing.\" Thus, the scaling factor is $S = 1/3$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values, $N=5$ and $S=1/3$, into the formula for the similarity dimension:\n$$D = \\frac{\\ln(N)}{\\ln(1/S)} = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{\\ln(1/(1/3))}$$\nThe denominator can be simplified.

For a given set $S$ in a plane, we can cover it with a grid of boxes of side length $\\epsilon$. Let $N(\\epsilon)$ be the minimum number of such boxes required to completely cover the set $S$.

Differentiability implies that if you zoom in on any point of the graph, the curve increasingly resembles a straight line segment. A finite collection of such segments has a total length $L$, which can be covered by a number of boxes $N(\\epsilon)$ roughly proportional to $L/\\epsilon$, leading to a dimension of 1.\n\nB. The function is continuous on the interval, which means its graph is an unbroken curve. Any unbroken curve is fundamentally a one-dimensional object, and therefore its box-counting dimension must be 1.\n\nC. The function is defined on a closed and bounded interval $[a, b]$. Any geometrical object confined to a finite region of the plane, and which does not fill a 2D area, must have a dimension of 1.\n\nD. Because the function $f(x)$ is continuously differentiable, both $f(x)$ and its derivative $f'(x)$ are finite everywhere on the interval $[a, b]$. This boundedness confines the graph to a finite bounding box, ensuring its dimension is not greater than 1.\n\nE. The derivative $f'(x)$ at any point represents the slope of the tangent line. A line is a one-dimensional object. Since the graph is composed of points where a one-dimensional tangent line exists, the dimension of the entire graph must also be 1.\n\n", "solution": "Let $f$ be continuously differentiable on $[a,b]$. By the mean value theorem, there exists $M=\\sup_{x\\in[a,b]}|f'(x)|<\\infty$, and hence for all $x,y\\in[a,b]$,\n$$\n|f(x)-f(y)|\\leq M|x-y|.\n$$\nThus $f$ is Lipschitz on $[a,b]$ with Lipschitz constant $M$.\n\nConsider the graph map $g:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ given by $g(x)=(x,f(x))$.

Among the options, statement A most accurately captures this reasoning: differentiability implies local linearity and finite length, and a rectifiable curve of length $L$ requires on the order of $L/\\epsilon$ boxes of side $\\epsilon$, leading directly to box-counting dimension $1$. The other statements are either imprecise or incorrect: continuity alone (B) does not force dimension $1$, confinement to a bounded region without area filling (C) is not sufficient, boundedness in a box (D) does not control dimension, and the existence of tangents (E) does not by itself determine the dimension of the entire set.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "In real-world applications, fractal dimensions are often determined experimentally or computationally rather than from a perfect geometric rule.
