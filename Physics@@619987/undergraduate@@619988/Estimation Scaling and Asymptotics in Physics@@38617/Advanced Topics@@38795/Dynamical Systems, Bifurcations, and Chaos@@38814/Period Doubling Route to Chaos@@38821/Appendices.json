{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The journey into chaotic dynamics often begins with a simple, fundamental event: a bifurcation. This is a \"tipping point\" where a small, smooth change in a system parameter, such as $c$, causes a sudden, qualitative change in the system's long-term behavior. This first practice invites you to analyze a simple quadratic map and pinpoint the exact parameter value at which the number of stable equilibrium states changes, an event known as a saddle-node bifurcation. Mastering this concept is the first step toward understanding the more complex series of bifurcations that pave the road to chaos [@problem_id:1920859].", "id": "1920859", "problem": "Consider a simplified model for a feedback system where the state of the system at a discrete time step $n+1$, denoted by $x_{n+1}$, is determined by its state at the previous time step $n$ according to the quadratic map:\n$$x_{n+1} = x_n^2 + c$$\nHere, $c$ is an adjustable real parameter of the system. An equilibrium state of the system is a value $x^*$ that remains unchanged from one time step to the next, i.e., if $x_n = x^*$, then $x_{n+1} = x^*$. Depending on the value of $c$, the system can have two, one, or zero real equilibrium states. Determine the specific value of the parameter $c$ that marks the bifurcation point where the number of real equilibrium states changes from two to one. Also, find the value of the single equilibrium state $x^*$ at this bifurcation point. Present your answer as a pair of values $(c, x^*)$, with $c$ as the first element and $x^*$ as the second.\n\n", "solution": "An equilibrium state, denoted by $x^*$, is a value that satisfies the condition $x_{n+1} = x_n = x^*$. To find the equilibrium states of the system described by the map $x_{n+1} = x_n^2 + c$, we substitute $x^*$ into the equation:\n$$x^* = (x^*)^2 + c$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into a standard quadratic equation form, $ax^2 + bx + d = 0$, by moving all terms to one side:\n$$(x^*)^2 - x^* + c = 0$$\nWe can solve for the equilibrium states $x^*$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ad}}{2a}$. In this case, the coefficients are $a=1$, $b=-1$, and the constant term is $d=c$. Substituting these into the formula gives:\n$$x^* = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(c)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$x^* = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4c}}{2}$$\nThe nature and number of real solutions for $x^*$ are determined by the discriminant, $\\Delta = 1 - 4c$.\n1.  If $\\Delta > 0$ (i.e., $1 - 4c > 0$, or $c < \\frac{1}{4}$), there are two distinct real equilibrium states.\n2.  If $\\Delta = 0$ (i.e., $1 - 4c = 0$, or $c = \\frac{1}{4}$), there is exactly one real equilibrium state, as the two roots become identical.\n3.  If $\\Delta < 0$ (i.e., $1 - 4c < 0$, or $c > \\frac{1}{4}$), there are no real equilibrium states; the solutions are a pair of complex conjugates.\n\nThe problem asks for the bifurcation point where the number of real equilibrium states changes from two to one. This transition occurs precisely when the discriminant is zero. Therefore, we set the discriminant to zero to find the critical value of $c$:\n$$\\Delta = 1 - 4c = 0$$\nSolving for $c$, we find:\n$$4c = 1$$\n$$c = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThis is the value of the parameter $c$ at the bifurcation point.\n\nNext, we need to find the value of the single equilibrium state $x^*$ at this specific value of $c$. We substitute $c = \\frac{1}{4}$ back into the general solution for $x^*$:\n$$x^* = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}}{2}$$\n$$x^* = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 1}}{2}$$\n$$x^* = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2}$$\n$$x^* = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus, at the bifurcation point, the single equilibrium state is $x^* = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe required answer is the pair of values $(c, x^*)$.

Instead of settling to a single equilibrium value, systems can begin to oscillate between multiple states. This exercise challenges you to calculate the precise parameter value, $r$, for which the logistic map exhibits a \"superstable\" 2-cycle, a specific and important type of oscillation where the system alternates between two values.
