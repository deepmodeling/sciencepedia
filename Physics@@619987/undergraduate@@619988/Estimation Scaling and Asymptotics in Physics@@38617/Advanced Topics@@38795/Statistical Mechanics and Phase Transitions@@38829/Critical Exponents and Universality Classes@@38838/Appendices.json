Consider a system whose state can be described by a single scalar order parameter, $\\phi$. This order parameter is zero in the high-temperature (disordered) phase and non-zero in the low-temperature (ordered) phase. Near the critical temperature $T_c$, the Ginzburg-Landau free energy density, $f$, of the system can be approximated by a polynomial expansion in the order parameter:\n\n$$f(\\phi) = f_0 + \\frac{a}{2} t \\phi^2 + \\frac{b}{4} \\phi^4$$\n\nHere, $f_0$, $a$, and $b$ are positive constants that depend on the material.

This exercise introduces the concept of hyperscaling, which connects thermodynamic exponents like $\\alpha$ to geometric ones like $\\nu$ via the spatial dimensionality $d$. By applying the Josephson-Wigner hyperscaling relation, you will predict the value of the specific heat exponent from the correlation length exponent in a three-dimensional system, demonstrating the deep interconnectedness that defines a universality class.", "problem": "In the study of second-order phase transitions, the concept of universality posits that the critical behavior of a system depends only on its spatial dimensionality and the symmetries of its order parameter, not on the microscopic details of its Hamiltonian. This leads to the definition of critical exponents that describe the singular behavior of various physical quantities near the critical temperature, $T_c$.\n\nConsider a theoretical model for a three-dimensional ($d=3$) magnetic material undergoing a ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transition. Near the critical point, the correlation length, $\\xi$, which represents the typical length scale of correlated magnetic fluctuations, is observed to diverge according to the power law $\\xi \\propto |t|^{-\\nu}$, where $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$ is the reduced temperature. Similarly, the specific heat at constant volume, $C_V$, exhibits a singular behavior described by $C_V \\propto |t|^{-\\alpha}$. Here, $\\nu$ and $\\alpha$ are the critical exponents for the correlation length and specific heat, respectively.\n\nFor this particular model, advanced calculations predict the correlation length exponent to be $\\nu = 0.711$. A cornerstone of the theory of critical phenomena is the existence of so-called hyperscaling relations, which link different critical exponents together. Using the appropriate hyperscaling relation that connects $\\alpha$, $\\nu$, and the spatial dimension $d$, determine the value of the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$.\n\nExpress your answer as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the value of the specific heat critical exponent, $\\alpha$, given the spatial dimensionality, $d$, and the correlation length critical exponent, $\\nu$. This requires the use of a hyperscaling relation that connects these three quantities.\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant physical principle.\nThe core principle connecting these exponents is the hyperscaling hypothesis. This hypothesis states that the singular part of the Gibbs free energy density, $f_s$, is determined by a single characteristic length scale, which is the correlation length $\\xi$. The free energy density has units of energy per unit volume, which is equivalent to energy / (length)$^d$. The only energy scale near the critical point is $k_B T_c$ (which is a constant and can be absorbed into the proportionality constant), and the only length scale is $\\xi$. Therefore, the singular free energy density must scale as $f_s \\propto \\xi^{-d}$.\n\nStep 2: Relate the free energy to the critical exponents.\nWe are given that the correlation length diverges as $\\xi \\propto |t|^{-\\nu}$, where $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$ is the reduced temperature. Substituting this into our expression for the free energy density:\n$$f_s \\propto (|t|^{-\\nu})^{-d} = |t|^{d\\nu}$$\n\nStep 3: Relate the specific heat to the free energy.\nThe specific heat at constant volume, $C_V$, is related to the second derivative of the free energy with respect to temperature. For the singular part, we have:\n$$C_V = -T \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial T^2} \\propto \\frac{\\partial^2 f_s}{\\partial T^2}$$\nwhere $f$ is the free energy density. Since $t = (T-T_c)/T_c$, the derivative with respect to $T$ is proportional to the derivative with respect to $t$: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} = \\frac{1}{T_c} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$. Near the critical point, the $T$ prefactor and the $1/T_c$ factor are constants and can be absorbed into the proportionality. Thus, the scaling of $C_V$ with respect to $t$ is determined by the second derivative of $f_s$:\n$$C_V \\propto \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} (|t|^{d\\nu})$$\nTaking the derivatives, we find that the power of $|t|$ is reduced by 2.\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (|t|^{d\\nu}) \\propto |t|^{d\\nu - 1}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} (|t|^{d\\nu}) \\propto |t|^{d\\nu - 2}$$\nSo, the scaling of the specific heat is $C_V \\propto |t|^{d\\nu - 2}$.\n\nStep 4: Equate the derived scaling with the definition of $\\alpha$.\nThe problem defines the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ via the relation $C_V \\propto |t|^{-\\alpha}$. By comparing the exponent from our scaling argument with the definition, we find:\n$$-\\alpha = d\\nu - 2$$\nThis equation, often written as $2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$, is the Josephson-Wigner hyperscaling relation.\n\nStep 5: Solve for $\\alpha$ and substitute the given values.\nWe rearrange the relation to solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Spatial dimensionality, $d = 3$.\n- Correlation length exponent, $\\nu = 0.711$.\n\nNow, we can compute the value of $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = 2 - (3 \\times 0.711)$$\n$$\\alpha = 2 - 2.133$$\n$$\\alpha = -0.133$$\n\nThe negative sign for $\\alpha$ indicates that the specific heat does not diverge to infinity at the critical temperature. Instead, it exhibits a finite cusp, as $C_V \\propto |t|^{-(-0.133)} = |t|^{0.133}$. Since $|t| \\to 0$ at the critical point, $C_V$ goes to a finite value, but its derivative with respect to temperature diverges.\n\nStep 6: Final Answer Formatting.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Our calculated value, -0.133, is already in this form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-0.133}$$", "id": "1893231"}]}
