Through careful experimentation near the critical temperature $T_c$, they have characterized the behavior of the system with two critical exponents.\n\nFirst, by measuring the spontaneous magnetization $M$ in the absence of an external magnetic field for temperatures $T < T_c$, they found that it scales with the reduced temperature $t = \\frac{T - T_c}{T_c}$ as $M \\propto (-t)^{\\beta}$. The experimentally determined value for the exponent is $\\beta = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nSecond, they measured the zero-field magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$, which is defined as the response of the magnetization to a small applied magnetic field. For $T > T_c$, they observed that the susceptibility diverges as the critical temperature is approached, following the relation $\\chi \\propto t^{-\\gamma}$. Their measurement yielded a value for the exponent $\\gamma = \\frac{7}{4}$.\n\nThe group's theoretical collaborators suggest that this system should be described by the scaling hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the critical exponents are not independent but are connected by universal relations. One such relation, known as the Widom scaling law, connects $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, and another critical exponent $\\delta$ through the equation:\n$$ \\gamma = \\beta(\\delta - 1) $$\nThe exponent $\\delta$ characterizes the dependence of magnetization on an external magnetic field $h$ precisely at the critical temperature, where $M \\propto h^{1/\\delta}$.\n\nTo provide a stringent test of the scaling hypothesis for this new material, the group plans to perform a new experiment to measure $\\delta$. Before embarking on this measurement, they want to compute the precise value of $\\delta$ that is predicted by the Widom scaling law, using their existing experimental results for $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$.\n\nAssuming the measured values of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are exact and that the Widom scaling law holds for this material, calculate the predicted value of the critical exponent $\\delta$.", "solution": "The Widom scaling law relates the critical exponents by the equation $\\gamma = \\beta(\\delta - 1)$.
