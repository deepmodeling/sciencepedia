The connection, or \"bond,\" between any two adjacent sites, $i$ and $i+1$, is present with an independent probability $p$ and absent with probability $1-p$.\n\nA \"cluster\" is defined as a contiguous group of sites connected by an unbroken sequence of present bonds. The \"size\" of a cluster is the number of sites it contains. We are interested in the properties of the cluster that includes the origin (site 0).\n\nLet $S(p)$ represent the expected (average) size of the cluster connected to the origin. In percolation theory, the critical percolation threshold, $p_c$, is the probability at which characteristic quantities, such as the expected cluster size, diverge to infinity.\n\nBy first deriving a closed-form expression for $S(p)$ for the domain where it is finite, determine the exact value of the bond percolation threshold, $p_c$, for this one-dimensional system.", "solution": "We model the bonds as independent Bernoulli random variables with success probability $p$ (bond present) and failure probability $1-p$ (bond absent). On the semi-infinite chain starting at site $0$, the cluster containing the origin comprises site $0$ plus as many consecutive present bonds as occur before the first absent bond appears to the right. Because the chain is one-sided, there is only one direction of growth.\n\nLet $K$ be the number of consecutive present bonds starting from the bond between sites $0$ and $1$ up to (but not including) the first absent bond. By independence and identical distribution of bonds, $K$ has the geometric distribution with parameter $(1-p)$ on non-negative integers:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(K=k) = (1-p)p^{k}, \\quad k=0,1,2,\\dots\n$$\nFor $p<1$ there is zero probability of an infinite run, i.e., $\\mathbb{P}(K=\\infty)=0$, while for $p=1$ all bonds are present almost surely and $\\mathbb{P}(K=\\infty)=1$.\n\nThe cluster size $S$ is the number of sites in the cluster containing the origin, which is one more than the number of consecutive present bonds, so for $p<1$ we have $S=K+1$ almost surely.

At $p=1$, the probability that all bonds are present is $1$, so the cluster containing the origin is infinite almost surely, and the expectation is infinite.

The vertices of the grid are substations, and the edges are high-voltage transmission lines. Each transmission line can fail independently. Due to environmental factors like weather and aging, each line has a probability $p$ of being operational and a probability $1-p$ of being failed.\n\nThe network is considered to be \"horizontally connected\" if there exists at least one continuous path of operational transmission lines connecting a substation on the far-left boundary of the grid to a substation on the far-right boundary.\n\nConversely, the network is considered to be \"vertically severed\" if there exists at least one continuous path of failed transmission lines connecting a substation on the top boundary of the grid to a substation on the bottom boundary.\n\nFor an infinitely large grid, it is a known topological property that the network cannot be simultaneously horizontally connected and vertically severed. One of these two conditions must be true. The transition between a state of near-certain horizontal connectivity and near-certain lack of connectivity occurs abruptly at a specific critical probability, $p_c$. For any $p > p_c$, the network is horizontally connected with probability 1, and for any $p < p_c$, it is horizontally connected with probability 0.\n\nBased on the symmetry between the grid's structure and its failure modes, determine the exact value of this critical probability $p_c$.", "solution": "Let the infinite square lattice be denoted by $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, with each edge independently open (operational) with probability $p$ and closed (failed) with probability $1-p$.

Declare a dual edge open if and only if the corresponding primal edge is closed. Thus, dual edges are open with probability $1-p$. In a rectangle, exactly one of the following occurs: either there is an open left-right crossing in the primal, or there is an open top-bottom crossing in the dual (equivalently, a closed top-bottom crossing in the primal).
