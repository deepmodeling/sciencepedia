In this model, a crack propagates through the material and, at certain points, bifurcates into two smaller daughter cracks. This branching process repeats at smaller and smaller scales, creating a fractal pattern.\n\nThe model is based on a principle of self-similarity. Let the length of a \"parent\" crack be $L_0$. When it bifurcates, it creates two daughter cracks of lengths $L_1$ and $L_2$. The lengths of these daughter cracks are scaled-down versions of the parent crack's length. The specific scaling relations are given by $L_1 = s_1 L_0$ and $L_2 = s_2 L_0$, where $s_1$ and $s_2$ are the respective scaling factors.\n\nThe self-similarity of the network is quantified by a fractal dimension, $D$. The core hypothesis of the model is that the \"fractal measure\" of the parent crack is equal to the sum of the fractal measures of its daughter cracks. The fractal measure of a crack of length $L$ is defined to be proportional to $L^D$.\n\nFor this particular composite material, the scaling factors are not simple constants but are related through a global parameter, $s$, such that $s_1 = \\alpha s$ and $s_2 = \\beta s$.
