Consider an animal's leg to be a rigid, uniform rod of length $L$ and mass $M$. This leg pivots without friction at the hip joint, located at its upper end. During a natural walking gait, the leg swings back and forth under the influence of gravity. The characteristic frequency of this swing for small oscillations determines the animal's natural stride rate.\n\nBased on this model, the natural swing frequency $f$ can be expressed as a function of the leg's length $L$.
