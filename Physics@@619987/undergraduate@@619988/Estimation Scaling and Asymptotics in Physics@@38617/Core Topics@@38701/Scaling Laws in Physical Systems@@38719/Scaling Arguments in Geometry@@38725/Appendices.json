This practice explores how an object's strength, which depends on its cross-sectional area, competes with its own weight, which depends on its volume. By analyzing a simple, hypothetical scenario involving a series of tables [@problem_id:1928752], you will derive a fundamental principle that explains why simply scaling up a design is often not feasible in engineering and biology.", "problem": "An artisan is commissioned to create a series of designer tables. All tables in the series are perfect geometric replicas of a prototype, differing only in scale, and are all constructed from the same uniform, homogeneous material.\n\nThe initial prototype, known as the \"Studio\" model, has a characteristic linear dimension $L_0$ (which we can take to be its height). The weight of this Studio model is measured to be $w_0$. Through stress testing, it is determined that the Studio model's legs will collapse when a total external load of $W_0$ is uniformly distributed on its top surface. The physical analysis concludes that the failure of the legs is due to compressive stress, and the maximum load the legs can support before collapsing is directly proportional to their total cross-sectional area.\n\nThe artisan now plans to build a much larger \"Banquet\" model. Every linear dimension of the Banquet model is scaled up by a factor of $n > 1$ relative to the Studio model, so its characteristic linear dimension is $L = n L_0$.\n\nDerive an expression for the maximum external load, $W_{max}$, that this new Banquet table can support before its legs collapse. Express your answer in terms of $n$, $W_0$, and $w_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum external load $W_{max}$ a scaled-up table can support. We need to relate the properties of the large \"Banquet\" table to the known properties of the small \"Studio\" prototype.\n\nLet's denote the properties of the Studio model with a subscript '0' and the properties of the Banquet model with a subscript 'n'.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in two scaling relationships: the scaling of the table's structural strength and the scaling of its own weight.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structural strength. The problem states that the maximum force the legs can support before failure, let's call it $F_{fail}$, is directly proportional to their total cross-sectional area, $A$. We can write this as a physical law:\n$$F_{fail} = C \\cdot A$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant that depends on the material's properties (its compressive strength).\n\nFor the Studio model, the legs can support a maximum force $F_{fail,0} = C A_0$, where $A_0$ is the total cross-sectional area of its legs. This maximum force must be equal to the total load on the legs at the point of collapse, which is the sum of the table's own weight $w_0$ and the maximum external load $W_0$.\n$$F_{fail,0} = w_0 + W_0$$\nCombining these, we have an expression for the properties of the prototype:\n$$C A_0 = w_0 + W_0$$\n\nNow, consider the Banquet model. Its linear dimensions are scaled by a factor of $n$. Since area scales as the square of linear dimensions, the total cross-sectional area of the Banquet model's legs, $A_n$, will be:\n$$A_n = n^2 A_0$$\nThe maximum force the Banquet model's legs can support, $F_{fail,n}$, is therefore:\n$$F_{fail,n} = C A_n = C (n^2 A_0) = n^2 (C A_0)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C A_0$ from the prototype analysis, we get:\n$$F_{fail,n} = n^2 (w_0 + W_0)$$\nThis equation tells us the total load the larger table's legs can withstand.\n\nNext, we must account for the Banquet table's own weight. The weight of an object made of a uniform material is proportional to its volume, $V$. We have $w = \\rho g V$, where $\\rho$ is the material density and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Volume scales as the cube of linear dimensions. The weight of the Studio model is $w_0$. Therefore, the weight of the Banquet model, $w_n$, is:\n$$w_n = n^3 w_0$$\n\nThe total force that the Banquet model's legs must support at the point of failure is the sum of its own weight $w_n$ and the maximum external load $W_{max}$ we want to find. At the collapse threshold, this force equals the failure strength $F_{fail,n}$:\n$$F_{fail,n} = w_n + W_{max}$$\nWe can now solve for $W_{max}$:\n$$W_{max} = F_{fail,n} - w_n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions we derived for $F_{fail,n}$ and $w_n$:\n$$W_{max} = n^2 (w_0 + W_0) - n^3 w_0$$\nThis is the final expression for the maximum external load the Banquet table can support. We can also expand and regroup the terms:\n$$W_{max} = n^2 W_0 + n^2 w_0 - n^3 w_0 = n^2 W_0 + w_0(n^2 - n^3)$$\nThis form highlights that the load capacity scales with $n^2$ but is diminished by the self-weight, which scales more rapidly with $n^3$. The first expression is just as valid.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n^{2}(W_{0} + w_{0}) - n^{3}w_{0}}$$", "id": "1928752"}, {"introduction": "Moving from static structures to dynamic systems, we now investigate how the oscillation period of a physical pendulum changes with its length [@problem_id:1928735].
