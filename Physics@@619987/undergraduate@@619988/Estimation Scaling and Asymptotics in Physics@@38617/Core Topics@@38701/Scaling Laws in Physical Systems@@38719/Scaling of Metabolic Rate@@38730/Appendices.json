For these animals, the buoyant force of water entirely supports their weight, rendering skeletal and muscular support against gravity a negligible energy cost. Instead, the primary metabolic challenge is thermoregulationâ€”maintaining a constant body temperature in water, which has a high thermal conductivity.\n\nDevelop a simplified model for these aquatic mammals based on the following assumptions:\n1.  All animals in this class are geometrically similar, regardless of their size, and have a uniform density, $\\rho$.\n2.  The basal metabolic rate, $P$, is entirely dedicated to generating heat to compensate for heat loss to the surrounding water.\n3.
