In this model, we study spiders of a particular species that are all geometrically similar but vary in size. This means that if one spider has a characteristic linear dimension $L_s$ (such as its leg length), any other spider of the same species will have all its corresponding linear dimensions scaled by the same factor. Consequently, the mass $m$ of a spider scales as $m \\propto L_s^3$.\n\nA spider is observed hanging vertically at rest from a single strand of its silk, called a dragline. The length of this dragline, $L$, is also found to scale directly with the spider's characteristic size, so $L \\propto L_s$.
