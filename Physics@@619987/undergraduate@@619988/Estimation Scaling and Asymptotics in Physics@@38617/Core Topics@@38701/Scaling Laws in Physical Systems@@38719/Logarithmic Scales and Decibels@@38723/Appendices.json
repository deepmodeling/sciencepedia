This practice problem addresses this misconception head-on by presenting a scenario with multiple, uncorrelated sound sources. You will learn the correct method for combining sound levels: converting each decibel value back to its corresponding linear intensity, summing these intensities, and then converting the total intensity back into a final decibel level. This process is essential for accurately predicting the total noise level in any environment with more than one sound source.", "problem": "A sound engineer is in a control room, monitoring two isolated live rooms. In Live Room 1, a guitarist is playing, producing an average sound intensity level of $L_1 = 94.0$ dB. In Live Room 2, a drummer is playing, producing an average sound intensity level of $L_2 = 103.0$ dB. The sound from each live room bleeds into the control room through the soundproofed walls. The soundproofing from Live Room 1 provides an attenuation of $A_1 = 40.0$ dB, and the soundproofing from Live Room 2 provides an attenuation of $A_2 = 45.0$ dB.\n\nThe sound intensity level $L$ in decibels (dB) is defined as $L = 10 \\log_{10}(I/I_0)$, where $I$ is the sound intensity and $I_0 = 10^{-12} \\text{ W/m}^2$ is the standard reference intensity. Assume the sounds from the two rooms are uncorrelated.\n\nCalculate the combined sound intensity level in the control room due to the sound bleeding from both live rooms. Express your answer in decibels (dB), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the combined sound intensity level in a control room from two separate, uncorrelated sound sources in adjacent rooms, considering the attenuation provided by the walls. The key principles are that for uncorrelated sources, their intensities add linearly, and the decibel scale is logarithmic.\n\nFirst, let's denote the initial sound intensity levels in the live rooms as $L_1 = 94.0$ dB and $L_2 = 103.0$ dB. The respective attenuations are $A_1 = 40.0$ dB and $A_2 = 45.0$ dB.\n\nAn attenuation in decibels corresponds to a subtraction from the sound intensity level. So, the sound intensity level from each source as it arrives in the control room, let's call them $L_{1,c}$ and $L_{2,c}$, can be calculated as follows:\n$$L_{1,c} = L_1 - A_1 = 94.0 \\text{ dB} - 40.0 \\text{ dB} = 54.0 \\text{ dB}$$\n$$L_{2,c} = L_2 - A_2 = 103.0 \\text{ dB} - 45.0 \\text{ dB} = 58.0 \\text{ dB}$$\n\nTo find the combined sound level, we cannot simply add the decibel values. We must convert the sound intensity levels back to intensities, add them, and then convert the total intensity back to a decibel level. The formula for sound intensity level is $L = 10 \\log_{10}(I/I_0)$. We can rearrange this to solve for intensity $I$:\n$$I = I_0 \\times 10^{L/10}$$\n\nUsing this formula, we can find the intensities $I_{1,c}$ and $I_{2,c}$ in the control room corresponding to the levels $L_{1,c}$ and $L_{2,c}$:\n$$I_{1,c} = I_0 \\times 10^{L_{1,c}/10} = I_0 \\times 10^{54.0/10} = I_0 \\times 10^{5.4}$$\n$$I_{2,c} = I_0 \\times 10^{L_{2,c}/10} = I_0 \\times 10^{58.0/10} = I_0 \\times 10^{5.8}$$\n\nSince the sources are uncorrelated, the total intensity $I_{total}$ in the control room is the linear sum of the individual intensities:\n$$I_{total} = I_{1,c} + I_{2,c} = I_0 \\times 10^{5.4} + I_0 \\times 10^{5.8}$$\n$$I_{total} = I_0 (10^{5.4} + 10^{5.8})$$\n\nNow, we convert this total intensity back to a sound intensity level, $L_{total}$:\n$$L_{total} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{total}}{I_0}\\right) = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0 (10^{5.4} + 10^{5.8})}{I_0}\\right)$$\n$$L_{total} = 10 \\log_{10}(10^{5.4} + 10^{5.8})$$\n\nTo evaluate this, we can factor out the larger term from the sum:\n$$L_{total} = 10 \\log_{10}(10^{5.8}(10^{5.4-5.8} + 1)) = 10 \\log_{10}(10^{5.8}(10^{-0.4} + 1))$$\n\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$:\n$$L_{total} = 10 [\\log_{10}(10^{5.8}) + \\log_{10}(10^{-0.4} + 1)]$$\n$$L_{total} = 10 [5.8 + \\log_{10}(10^{-0.4} + 1)]$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$$10^{-0.4} \\approx 0.398107$$\n$$10^{-0.4} + 1 \\approx 1.398107$$\n$$\\log_{10}(1.398107) \\approx 0.145544$$\n\nSubstitute this back into the expression for $L_{total}$:\n$$L_{total} \\approx 10 [5.8 + 0.145544] = 10 [5.945544] = 59.45544 \\text{ dB}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$L_{total} \\approx 59.5 \\text{ dB}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{59.5}$$", "id": "1913617"}, {"introduction": "The decibel scale is not just for measuring levels; it's a powerful tool for analyzing changes.
