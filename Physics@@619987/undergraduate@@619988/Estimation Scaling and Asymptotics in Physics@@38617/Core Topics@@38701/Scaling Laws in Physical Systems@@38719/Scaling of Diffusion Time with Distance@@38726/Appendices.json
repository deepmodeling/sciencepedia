By analyzing high-resolution images, she determines the characteristic blur distance—the typical distance a pigment particle has spread from its original application point—to be $d_1 = 2.0$ millimeters.\n\nDeeper within the cave, she discovers another, more ancient-looking set of paintings made with what appears to be the same type of ochre pigment on the same type of rock. These deeper paintings are significantly more blurred, with a measured characteristic blur distance of $d_2 = 3.5$ millimeters.\n\nAssuming that the blurring process is governed by a standard diffusion model where the effective diffusion coefficient of the pigment in the rock is constant over time and location, calculate the age, $t_2$, of the deeper set of paintings.

The pellet is designed to release the drug over a prolonged period. The initial radius of the pellet is $R_0$. The drug material has a constant solid density $\\rho$.\n\nThe dissolution process unfolds as follows: The drug dissolves at the surface of the pellet, maintaining a constant saturation concentration $C_{sat}$ in the fluid immediately adjacent to the surface. The drug then diffuses away into the surrounding tissue, where its concentration is negligible far from the pellet. This diffusion is governed by a diffusion coefficient $D$.\n\nAssume that the overall rate of dissolution is limited by the diffusion of the drug away from the pellet's surface. A key modeling assumption is that the concentration gradient that drives the diffusion occurs over a characteristic length scale on the order of the pellet's instantaneous radius, $R(t)$.\n\nThe total time required for the pellet to dissolve completely, $t_{\\text{dissolve}}$, is found to be related to its initial radius by a power law: $t_{\\text{dissolve}} = k R_0^{\\alpha}$, where $k$ is a constant that depends on the material properties ($\\rho$, $C_{sat}$, $D$) and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless scaling exponent.\n\nDetermine the value of the exponent $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ in the relationship $t_{\\text{dissolve}} \\propto R_0^{\\alpha}$. To find this, we must derive an expression for the total dissolution time, $t_{\\text{dissolve}}$, based on the physical model described.\n\nFirst, let's express the mass of the spherical pellet at any given time $t$. The pellet has a time-dependent radius $R(t)$ and a constant density $\\rho$. Its volume is $V(t) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R(t)^3$.\nThe mass of the pellet is therefore:\n$$m(t) = \\rho V(t) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\rho R(t)^3$$\nThe rate of change of the pellet's mass, $\\frac{dm}{dt}$, can be found by differentiating this expression with respect to time:\n$$\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\rho R(t)^3\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\rho \\cdot 3R(t)^2 \\frac{dR}{dt} = 4\\pi \\rho R(t)^2 \\frac{dR}{dt}$$\n\nNext, we model the rate of mass loss due to diffusion. The problem states this is the limiting process. The rate of mass loss is equal to the total mass flux leaving the surface of the pellet. This can be written as the product of the mass flux $J$ (mass per unit area per unit time) and the surface area $A(t)$ of the sphere.\nThe surface area is $A(t) = 4\\pi R(t)^2$.\nThe mass flux $J$ is given by Fick's first law of diffusion, $J = -D \\frac{dC}{dr}$, where $\\frac{dC}{dr}$ is the concentration gradient. The problem provides a crucial simplification: we can approximate the magnitude of the concentration gradient over the characteristic length scale of the pellet's instantaneous radius, $R(t)$. The concentration drops from $C_{sat}$ at the surface to approximately 0 far away.\nSo, we approximate the magnitude of the gradient as:\n$$|\\frac{dC}{dr}| \\approx \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\text{length scale}} = \\frac{C_{sat} - 0}{R(t)} = \\frac{C_{sat}}{R(t)}$$\nThe flux of mass leaving the surface is therefore:\n$$J \\approx D \\frac{C_{sat}}{R(t)}$$\nThe total rate of mass loss is the flux multiplied by the surface area. Since mass is leaving the pellet, $\\frac{dm}{dt}$ must be negative.\n$$\\frac{dm}{dt} = -J \\cdot A(t) = -\\left(D \\frac{C_{sat}}{R(t)}\\right) \\cdot \\left(4\\pi R(t)^2\\right) = -4\\pi D C_{sat} R(t)$$\n\nNow we have two expressions for $\\frac{dm}{dt}$. We can equate them to obtain a differential equation for the radius $R(t)$.\n$$4\\pi \\rho R(t)^2 \\frac{dR}{dt} = -4\\pi D C_{sat} R(t)$$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $4\\pi R(t)$ from both sides (assuming $R(t) \\neq 0$ during the process):\n$$\\rho R(t) \\frac{dR}{dt} = -D C_{sat}$$\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation.
