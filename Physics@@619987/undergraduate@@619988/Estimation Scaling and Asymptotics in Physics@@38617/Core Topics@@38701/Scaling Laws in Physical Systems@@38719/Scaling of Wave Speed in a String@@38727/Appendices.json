The design involves braiding multiple strands of a new synthetic fiber together. The basic building block is a single, uniform fiber strand.\n\nLet's model this scenario. A \"standard\" cable, Cable 1, consists of just a single strand of this fiber. A \"heavy-duty\" cable, Cable 2, is constructed by braiding together $N$ identical strands of the same fiber.

The relationship is given by the formula:\n$$ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu}} $$\n\nLet's analyze the two cables based on this principle.\n\nFirst, consider Cable 1, which is the single strand of fiber. Let its mass be $m$ and its length be $L$. Its linear mass density, which we will call $\\mu_1$, is:\n$$ \\mu_1 = \\frac{m}{L} $$\nThe problem states that Cable 1 is under tension $T$. Therefore, the speed of a transverse wave on Cable 1, $v_1$, is:\n$$ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu_1}} $$\n\nNext, consider Cable 2, which is made by braiding $N$ identical strands. According to the problem statement, the total mass of Cable 2 is the sum of the masses of the $N$ individual strands. Since each strand has mass $m$, the total mass of Cable 2 is $N \\times m$. The length of Cable 2 is given as $L$.\nThe linear mass density of Cable 2, which we will call $\\mu_N$, is therefore:\n$$ \\mu_N = \\frac{\\text{Total Mass}}{\\text{Length}} = \\frac{Nm}{L} $$\nWe can relate $\\mu_N$ to $\\mu_1$:\n$$ \\mu_N = N \\left( \\frac{m}{L} \\right) = N \\mu_1 $$\nThis shows that the linear mass density of the N-strand cable is $N$ times that of the single-strand cable.\n\nThe problem states that Cable 2 is also under the same tension $T$. The speed of a transverse wave on Cable 2, $v_N$, is:\n$$ v_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\mu_N}} $$\nNow, we can substitute our expression for $\\mu_N$ in terms of $\\mu_1$:\n$$ v_N = \\sqrt{\\frac{T}{N \\mu_1}} $$\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\frac{v_N}{v_1}$.
