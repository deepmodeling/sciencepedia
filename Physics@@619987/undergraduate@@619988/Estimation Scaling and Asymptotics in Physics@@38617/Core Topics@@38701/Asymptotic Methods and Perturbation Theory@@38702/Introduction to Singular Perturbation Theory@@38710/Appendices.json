When we set $\\epsilon=0$, the order of the differential equation reduces, and we cannot generally satisfy both boundary conditions. This indicates the presence of a boundary layer.\n\n**Step 1: Find the Outer Solution**\nWe first find the \"outer solution\" $y_{out}(x)$, which is valid away from the boundary layer. We assume $\\epsilon \\to 0$ in the original equation:\n$$ (1+x)y_{out}' + y_{out} = 0 $$\nThis is a first-order, separable differential equation.\n$$ \\frac{dy_{out}}{dx} = -\\frac{y_{out}}{1+x} $$\n$$ \\frac{dy_{out}}{y_{out}} = -\\frac{dx}{1+x} $$\nIntegrating both sides gives:\n$$ \\ln|y_{out}| = -\\ln|1+x| + C $$\n$$ y_{out}(x) = \\exp(-\\ln(1+x) + C) = \\frac{A}{1+x} $$\nwhere $A = e^C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nThe coefficient of the $y'$ term, $p(x) = 1+x$, is positive for $x \\in [0, 1]$. In such cases, the boundary layer is expected to be at the left endpoint, $x=0$. Therefore, the outer solution should satisfy the boundary condition at the right endpoint, $x=1$.\n$$ y_{out}(1) = 1 \\implies 1 = \\frac{A}{1+1} \\implies A=2 $$\nSo, the outer solution is:\n$$ y_{out}(x) = \\frac{2}{1+x} $$\nNote that at $x=0$, $y_{out}(0) = 2$, which does not satisfy the boundary condition $y(0)=0$. This confirms the need for a boundary layer correction near $x=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Inner Solution (Boundary Layer Analysis)**\nTo analyze the boundary layer at $x=0$, we introduce a stretched coordinate $X = x/\\epsilon$. We define the inner solution as $Y(X) = y(x) = y(\\epsilon X)$. The derivatives in terms of $X$ are:\n$$ y' = \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dY}{dX}\\frac{dX}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{dY}{dX} $$\n$$ y'' = \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{dY}{dX}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^2Y}{dX^2} \\frac{dX}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\frac{d^2Y}{dX^2} $$\nSubstituting these into the original ODE:\n$$ \\epsilon \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}\\frac{d^2Y}{dX^2}\\right) + (1+\\epsilon X)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{dY}{dX}\\right) + Y = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{d^2Y}{dX^2} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\frac{dY}{dX} + X\\frac{dY}{dX} + Y = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2Y}{dX^2} + \\frac{dY}{dX} + \\epsilon\\left(X\\frac{dY}{dX} + Y\\right) = 0 $$\nFor the leading-order inner solution, $Y_{in}(X)$, we take the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2Y_{in}}{dX^2} + \\frac{dY_{in}}{dX} = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order linear ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $r^2 + r = 0$, which has roots $r=0$ and $r=-1$. The general solution is:\n$$ Y_{in}(X) = B e^{-X} + D $$\nwhere $B$ and $D$ are constants.\n\n**Step 3: Matching and Determining Constants**\nThe inner solution must satisfy the boundary condition at $x=0$ (which is $X=0$).\n$$ y(0) = 0 \\implies Y_{in}(0) = 0 $$\n$$ B e^0 + D = 0 \\implies B + D = 0 \\implies D = -B $$\nSo, the inner solution has the form:\n$$ Y_{in}(X) = B(e^{-X} - 1) $$\nNext, we match the inner and outer solutions using the Van Dyke matching principle: the long-range behavior of the inner solution must match the short-range behavior of the outer solution.\n$$ \\lim_{X \\to \\infty} Y_{in}(X) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} y_{out}(x) $$\n$$ \\lim_{X \\to \\infty} B(e^{-X} - 1) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{2}{1+x} $$\n$$ B(0 - 1) = \\frac{2}{1+0} $$\n$$ -B = 2 \\implies B = -2 $$\nWith $B=-2$, we find $D = -B = 2$. The leading-order inner solution is:\n$$ Y_{in}(X) = -2e^{-X} + 2 = 2(1 - e^{-X}) $$\nIn terms of the original variable $x$, this is $y_{in}(x) = 2(1 - e^{-x/\\epsilon})$.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Composite Solution**\nThe uniform approximation, or composite solution $y_{comp}(x)$, is found by adding the inner and outer solutions and subtracting their overlapping part. The overlapping part is the value found during matching, which is 2.\n$$ y_{comp}(x) = y_{out}(x) + y_{in}(x) - (\\text{common part}) $$\n$$ y_{comp}(x) = \\frac{2}{1+x} + 2(1 - e^{-x/\\epsilon}) - 2 $$\n$$ y_{comp}(x) = \\frac{2}{1+x} + 2 - 2e^{-x/\\epsilon} - 2 $$\n$$ y_{comp}(x) = \\frac{2}{1+x} - 2e^{-x/\\epsilon} $$\nThis expression provides a uniform approximation to the solution across the entire domain $[0, 1]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{1+x} - 2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\epsilon}\\right)}$$", "id": "1909523"}, {"introduction": "The concepts of inner and outer regions are not limited to spatial domains; they are just as powerful when applied to time.
