We will determine the scaling for each of these pressures and then form their ratio. Let the wave have a small amplitude $A$ and a wavenumber $k$. The wavelength $\\lambda$ is related to the wavenumber by $k = 2\\pi / \\lambda$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the restoring pressure due to gravity, $P_{grav}$. When the liquid surface is displaced vertically by a height $A$ from its equilibrium position, a pressure difference is created due to the weight of the displaced fluid column. This hydrostatic pressure difference acts as a restoring mechanism. The magnitude of this pressure is given by:\n$$P_{grav} = \\rho g A$$\nThis provides the characteristic scale for the gravitational restoring pressure.\n\nNext, let's consider the restoring pressure due to surface tension, $P_{cap}$. Surface tension at a curved interface results in a pressure difference across the interface, known as the Laplace pressure. This pressure acts to flatten the surface, thus serving as a restoring mechanism. The Laplace pressure is proportional to the product of the surface tension $\\gamma$ and the curvature of the surface $\\kappa$:\n$$P_{cap} \\propto \\gamma \\kappa$$\nFor a one-dimensional sinusoidal wave profile, $z(x) = A \\sin(kx)$, the curvature $\\kappa$ (for small amplitudes, where the slope is small) is approximately the magnitude of the second derivative of the surface profile:\n$$\\kappa \\approx \\left| \\frac{d^2z}{dx^2} \\right|$$\nCalculating the second derivative:\n$$\\frac{dz}{dx} = A k \\cos(kx)$$\n$$\\frac{d^2z}{dx^2} = -A k^2 \\sin(kx)$$\nThe characteristic magnitude of the curvature is therefore $\\kappa \\sim A k^2$. Substituting this into our scaling relation for the capillary pressure, we get:\n$$P_{cap} \\propto \\gamma (A k^2)$$\n\nNow we can form the required dimensionless ratio by dividing the characteristic capillary pressure by the characteristic gravitational pressure:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{P_{cap}}{P_{grav}} \\propto \\frac{\\gamma A k^2}{\\rho g A}$$\nThe amplitude $A$ is a common factor in both expressions and cancels out, leaving a ratio that depends only on the fluid properties and the wavenumber of the wave:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\gamma k^2}{\\rho g}$$\nTo confirm this parameter is dimensionless, we can check the units.\n- $\\gamma$ (surface tension): $[M][T]^{-2}$\n- $k$ (wavenumber): $[L]^{-1}$\n- $\\rho$ (density): $[M][L]^{-3}$\n- $g$ (acceleration): $[L][T]^{-2}$\n\nThe units of the ratio are:\n$$\\frac{([M][T]^{-2}) ([L]^{-1})^2}{([M][L]^{-3}) ([L][T]^{-2])} = \\frac{[M][L]^{-2}[T]^{-2}}{[M][L]^{-2}[T]^{-2}} = 1$$\nThe parameter is indeed dimensionless.\n\nThis parameter, often related to the inverse of the Bond number for a characteristic length scale $1/k$, represents the ratio of surface tension effects to gravitational effects.
