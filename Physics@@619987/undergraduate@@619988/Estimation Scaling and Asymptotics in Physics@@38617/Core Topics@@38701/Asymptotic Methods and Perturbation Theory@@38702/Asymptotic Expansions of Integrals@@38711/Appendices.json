The lemma states that the asymptotic expansion of $I(z)$ can be found by replacing $f(t)$ with its Taylor series expansion about $t=0$ and integrating term by term.\n\nFirst, let's find the Taylor series for $f(t)$ around $t=0$.\nThe exponential term can be expanded as:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{t^2}{2} + \\frac{1}{2!}\\left(\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right)^2 - \\dots = 1 - \\frac{t^2}{2} + O(t^4)\n$$\nNow, we multiply by $t^{\\nu}$:\n$$\nf(t) = t^{\\nu} \\left(1 - \\frac{t^2}{2} + O(t^4)\\right) = t^{\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2}t^{\\nu+2} + O(t^{\\nu+4})\n$$\nThe leading-order term in the asymptotic expansion of $I(z)$ is obtained by taking only the first term of the series for $f(t)$.\n$$\nI(z) \\sim \\int_0^{\\infty} t^{\\nu} \\exp(-zt) dt\n$$\nThis is a standard integral representation of the Gamma function.
