Consider a simplified model of an estuary as a long, straight channel of uniform rectangular cross-section. The fresh river water flows into the estuary with a constant volumetric flow rate $Q$. This flow, a form of advection, carries the fresh water towards the sea. Simultaneously, salt from the ocean diffuses upstream into the fresh water. We can model the estuary channel as having an average width $W$ and an average depth $H$. The mixing process between fresh and salt water occurs over a characteristic length scale $L$ along the estuary, often called the brackish zone. The molecular diffusion coefficient for salt in water is given by the constant $D_s$.\n\nThe Péclet number (Pe) is a dimensionless quantity used to characterize the relative importance of advection to diffusion in a transport process. A large Péclet number ($Pe \\gg 1$) indicates that transport is dominated by advection, while a small Péclet number ($Pe \\ll 1$) indicates that diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism.\n\nAssuming the river flow is uniform across the channel's cross-section, derive an expression for the Péclet number for salt transport in this estuary in terms of the given parameters $Q$, $W$, $H$, $L$, and $D_s$.", "solution": "The Péclet number for scalar transport along a channel is defined as the ratio of advective to diffusive transport, which can be written using a characteristic velocity $U$, a characteristic length $L$, and the molecular diffusion coefficient $D_{s}$ as\n$$\nPe=\\frac{U L}{D_{s}}.\n$$\nEquivalently, one can view $Pe$ as the ratio of the diffusion timescale to the advection timescale: $t_{\\text{diff}}=\\frac{L^{2}}{D_{s}}$ and $t_{\\text{adv}}=\\frac{L}{U}$, giving $Pe=\\frac{t_{\\text{diff}}}{t_{\\text{adv}}}=\\frac{U L}{D_{s}}$.\n\nWith uniform river flow across a rectangular cross-section of width $W$ and depth $H$, the cross-sectional area is\n$$\nA=W H,\n$$\nand the mean velocity is the volumetric flow rate divided by the area,\n$$\nU=\\frac{Q}{W H}.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Péclet number expression yields\n$$\nPe=\\frac{U L}{D_{s}}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{Q}{W H}\\right)L}{D_{s}}=\\frac{Q L}{W H D_{s}}.\n$$\nThis expression is dimensionless, as required: the numerator has dimensions of $L^{4}/T$ and the denominator has dimensions of $L^{4}/T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{Q L}{W H D_{s}}}$$", "id": "1920248"}, {"introduction": "Moving from symbolic derivation to numerical application, this problem challenges you to calculate the Péclet number for a more dynamic and entertaining scenario: creating a marbled pattern in a gelatin dessert.
