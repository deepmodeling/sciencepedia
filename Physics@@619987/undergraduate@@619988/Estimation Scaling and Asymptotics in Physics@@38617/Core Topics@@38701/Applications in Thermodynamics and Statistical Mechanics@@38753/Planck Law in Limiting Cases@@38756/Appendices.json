Physicists and astronomers often need to convert between these descriptions—spectral radiance per unit wavelength, $B_\\lambda(T)$, and per unit frequency, $B_\\nu(T)$. This first exercise is a fundamental workout in performing this conversion, which is essential for correctly interpreting spectral data. By working with a hypothetical radiation law, you can focus purely on the mathematical technique of changing variables, a skill that is broadly applicable across many areas of physics [@problem_id:1921918].", "problem": "In theoretical astrophysics, one might explore universes with different physical laws to understand our own. Consider a hypothetical scenario where the low-frequency limit of thermal radiation is described by a modified Rayleigh-Jeans law. The spectral radiance per unit frequency, $B_\\nu(\\nu, T)$, is observed to be proportional to the cube of the frequency $\\nu$ and the square root of the absolute temperature $T$.

The fundamental principle connecting the two forms of spectral radiance, $B_\\nu(\\nu, T)$ and $B_\\lambda(\\lambda, T)$, is that the energy contained within an infinitesimal spectral interval must be the same regardless of whether the interval is described by $d\\nu$ or $d\\lambda$.
