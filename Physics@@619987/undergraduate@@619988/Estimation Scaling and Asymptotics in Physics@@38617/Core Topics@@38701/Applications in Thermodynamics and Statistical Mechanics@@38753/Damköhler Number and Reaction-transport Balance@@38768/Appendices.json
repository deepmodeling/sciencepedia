These cells consume a nutrient (e.g., glucose) from a solution above them. We wish to determine whether the overall rate of nutrient consumption is limited by the cells' intrinsic metabolic processing speed (a \"reaction-limited\" process) or by the speed at which the nutrient can physically travel through the solution to reach the cells (a \"transport-limited\" process).\n\nTo investigate this, we consider an idealized scenario: a thin, dense layer of yeast cells is fixed to the bottom of a container. This layer is covered by a stagnant, unstirred solution of glucose. The competition between reaction and transport can be quantified by the Damköhler number, $Da$, which is the dimensionless ratio of the maximum possible reaction rate per unit area to the characteristic transport rate per unit area.

The formation of structured tissues and organs, like in synthetic gastruloids, depends on the establishment of precise chemical gradients by molecules called morphogens. This exercise [@problem_id:2676437] shows how the very same principles of reaction-diffusion balance govern the patterns of life, using the Damköhler number to determine whether a morphogen gradient is controlled by diffusion speed or the rate of cellular uptake.", "problem": "Synthetic embryo models such as blastoids and gastruloids establish spatial morphogen gradients through a balance between molecular diffusion and cellular uptake. Consider a spherical gastruloid of radius $R$ in which a morphogen of concentration $c(\\mathbf{x},t)$ diffuses with diffusion coefficient $D$ and is removed by uniformly distributed first-order uptake with rate constant $k$. A minimal continuum description is given by the reaction–diffusion equation $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c - k c$ with appropriate boundary supply at the surface. Using dimensional analysis and the characteristic length $R$, construct the single nondimensional group that compares uptake to diffusion over the organoid and identify it as the Damköhler number (Da).

In your reasoning, state whether the gradient regime is controlled predominantly by diffusion or by reaction, and justify why, but only report the Damköhler number itself as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed. We shall proceed with its analysis.\n\nThe system is described by the reaction–diffusion equation for the morphogen concentration $c(\\mathbf{x}, t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c - k c\n$$\nHere, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient and $k$ is the first-order uptake rate constant. The term $D \\nabla^2 c$ represents the change in concentration due to diffusion, and the term $-k c$ represents the change due to uptake.\n\nTo perform dimensional analysis, we consider the characteristic scales of the system. The characteristic length scale is given as the radius of the gastruloid, $R$. The establishment of a spatial gradient occurs when the system approaches a steady state, where $\\partial c / \\partial t \\approx 0$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nD \\nabla^2 c \\approx k c\n$$\nThis equation balances the rate of supply by diffusion with the rate of removal by uptake.\n\nLet us examine the characteristic magnitudes of these two terms. The Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ has dimensions of inverse length squared, so its magnitude scales as $1/R^2$. Thus, the diffusion term has a characteristic magnitude of:\n$$\n|D \\nabla^2 c| \\sim D \\frac{c_{\\text{char}}}{R^2}\n$$\nwhere $c_{\\text{char}}$ is a characteristic concentration.\n\nThe uptake term has a characteristic magnitude of:\n$$\n|k c| \\sim k c_{\\text{char}}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the nondimensional group that compares uptake to diffusion. This is the ratio of their characteristic magnitudes:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Magnitude of Uptake}}{\\text{Magnitude of Diffusion}} \\sim \\frac{k c_{\\text{char}}}{D c_{\\text{char}} / R^2} = \\frac{k R^2}{D}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is the Damköhler number, denoted as $\\text{Da}$.\n$$\n\\text{Da} = \\frac{k R^2}{D}\n$$\nThe Damköhler number can be interpreted as the ratio of the characteristic timescale for diffusion, $\\tau_{\\text{diff}} \\sim R^2/D$, to the characteristic timescale for reaction (uptake), $\\tau_{\\text{react}} \\sim 1/k$:\n$$\n\\text{Da} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{diff}}}{\\tau_{\\text{react}}}\n$$\n\nWe are given the following parameter values for a mouse gastruloid:\n- Diffusion coefficient, $D = 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}^{2}/\\mathrm{min}$\n- Uptake rate constant, $k = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n- Radius, $R = 250\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for the Damköhler number.

The problem requests the answer rounded to three significant figures. The exact value $12.5$ already has three significant figures, so no rounding is necessary.\n\nFinally, we must determine whether the gradient regime is controlled by diffusion or reaction. Since $\\text{Da} = 12.5$, we have $\\text{Da} \\gg 1$. This implies that the characteristic timescale for diffusion ($\\tau_{\\text{diff}} \\sim R^{2}/D = (250)^{2}/50 = 1250\\,\\mathrm{min}$) is much longer than the characteristic timescale for uptake ($\\tau_{\\text{react}} \\sim 1/k = 1/0.01 = 100\\,\\mathrm{min}$). Because $\\tau_{\\text{diff}} \\gg \\tau_{\\text{react}}$, a morphogen molecule is, on average, taken up long before it can diffuse across the entire gastruloid. Consequently, the process of gradient formation is limited by the slow rate of diffusion relative to the rapid rate of uptake. This is a **diffusion-limited** (or **transport-limited**) regime. The resulting morphogen gradient will be steep and localized near the surface where the morphogen is supplied, as it is consumed before it can penetrate deep into the tissue.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{12.5}\n$$", "id": "2676437"}]}
