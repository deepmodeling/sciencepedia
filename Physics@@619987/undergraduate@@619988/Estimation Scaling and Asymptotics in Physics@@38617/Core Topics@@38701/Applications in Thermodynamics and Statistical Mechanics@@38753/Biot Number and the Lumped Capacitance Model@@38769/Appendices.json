The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a comparative analysis. It is therefore a valid problem.\n\nWe will analyze the two models described and then evaluate each statement.\n\n**Model (i): Full Heat Conduction**\nThe temperature distribution $T(r,t)$ inside the sphere is governed by the heat equation in spherical coordinates. Assuming radial symmetry and constant material properties $(\\rho, c, k)$, the equation is:\n$$ \\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right) \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le r < R, t > 0 $$\nThe initial condition is a uniform temperature:\n$$ T(r,0) = T_i $$\nThe boundary conditions are symmetry at the center and convection at the surface:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{r=0} = 0 $$\n$$ -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{r=R} = h [T(R,t) - T_{\\infty}] $$\nThe solution to this system, $T(r,t)$, shows that the temperature varies with both radial position $r$ and time $t$.\n\n**Model (ii): Lumped Capacitance Model (LCM)**\nThis model assumes the temperature inside the sphere is spatially uniform at any given time, $T(t)$. This assumption is valid when the internal resistance to heat conduction is negligible compared to the external resistance to heat convection. An energy balance on the entire sphere yields:\n$$ \\text{Rate of change of internal energy} = \\text{Rate of heat loss by convection} $$\n$$ \\rho V c \\frac{dT}{dt} = -h A_s [T(t) - T_{\\infty}] $$\nHere, $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ is the volume of the sphere and $A_s = 4\\pi R^2$ is its surface area. Substituting these expressions gives:\n$$ \\rho \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3\\right) c \\frac{dT}{dt} = -h (4\\pi R^2) [T(t) - T_{\\infty}] $$\nSimplifying leads to the governing ordinary differential equation for the LCM:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho c R}{3} \\frac{dT}{dt} = -h [T(t) - T_{\\infty}] $$\nThe solution, subject to the initial condition $T(0) = T_i$, is an exponential decay:\n$$ \\frac{T(t) - T_{\\infty}}{T_i - T_{\\infty}} = e^{-t/\\tau} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\tau = \\frac{\\rho c R}{3h} $$\nThe quantity $\\tau$ is the characteristic time constant of the cooling process in this model.\n\n**Analysis of Options**\n\n**A. The lumped capacitance model is accurate when the Biot number based on the volume-to-surface characteristic length satisfies $Bi=h L_c/k \\lesssim 0.1$, where $L_c$ is the ratio of the sphere’s volume to its surface area; it fails when $Bi$ is not small because internal conduction resistance becomes non-negligible.**\nThe validity of the LCM is assessed using the Biot number, $Bi$, defined as the ratio of internal conduction resistance to external convection resistance.\n$$ Bi = \\frac{R_{\\text{cond, int}}}{R_{\\text{conv, ext}}} = \\frac{L_c/k}{1/h} = \\frac{h L_c}{k} $$\nThe characteristic length $L_c$ is correctly defined as the volume-to-area ratio, which for a sphere is $L_c = V/A_s = (4/3\\pi R^3)/(4\\pi R^2) = R/3$. The criterion for accuracy, $Bi \\lesssim 0.1$, is the standard engineering rule of thumb. When this condition is not met, it implies that the time required for heat to conduct through the body is not negligible compared to the time it takes to be removed from the surface, leading to significant internal temperature gradients and invalidating the LCM's core assumption. This statement is a factually correct and complete description.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For large Biot number $Bi \\gg 1$, the lumped capacitance model underestimates the early-time heat flux from the sphere compared to the full heat conduction solution, leading to a slower predicted decay of temperature.**\nA large Biot number ($Bi \\gg 1$) implies that internal conduction resistance is dominant. In the full model, the surface cools rapidly to a temperature $T(R,t)$, while the interior remains hot. The heat flux is $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{full}} = h A_s [T(R,t) - T_{\\infty}]$. The LCM uses a single average temperature, $T_{LCM}(t)$, and predicts a heat flux of $\\dot{Q}_{LCM} = h A_s [T_{LCM}(t) - T_{\\infty}]$. For large $Bi$ and early times, the average temperature of the sphere, $T_{LCM}(t)$, is significantly higher than the rapidly cooled surface temperature, $T(R,t)$. Therefore, $\\dot{Q}_{LCM} > \\dot{Q}_{\\text{full}}$. The LCM *overestimates* the heat flux, it does not underestimate it. This overestimation of heat loss leads to a prediction of a *faster* temperature decay, not a slower one. The statement is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For fixed material properties $(\\rho,c,k)$ and fixed $h$ and $T_{\\infty}$, increasing the radius $R$ worsens the accuracy of the lumped capacitance model.**\nThe accuracy of the LCM is inversely related to the magnitude of the Biot number. For the sphere, the Biot number is $Bi = \\frac{hR}{3k}$. Given that the parameters $h$ and $k$ are fixed, the Biot number is directly proportional to the radius $R$, i.e., $Bi \\propto R$. Therefore, increasing the sphere's radius $R$ increases the Biot number. A larger Biot number signifies a greater departure from the conditions where the LCM is valid. Thus, the accuracy of the LCM worsens as $R$ increases. This is physically because a larger radius implies a longer path for heat to conduct from the center to the surface, increasing the internal thermal resistance.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. When the lumped capacitance model is invalid, it always overestimates the center temperature relative to the full heat conduction solution at all times.**\nWhen the LCM is invalid ($Bi$ is not small), the true temperature profile shows a maximum at the center, $T_c(t) = T(0,t)$. The LCM temperature, $T_{LCM}(t)$, is analogous to a volume-averaged temperature. As established in the analysis of option B, the LCM overestimates the cooling rate, meaning $T_{LCM}(t)$ decreases faster than the true average temperature of the sphere. The center temperature, being the highest temperature in the sphere, cools the slowest. Therefore, for $t>0$, we have the relation $T_c(t) > T_{LCM}(t)$. The LCM *underestimates* the center temperature. The statement claims the opposite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In the limit $k \\to \\infty$ with finite $h$ and finite $R$, the two models predict identical uniform temperature evolution governed by a single time constant proportional to $(\\rho c R)/h$ up to a geometric factor.**\nTaking the limit of thermal conductivity $k \\to \\infty$ while holding $h$ and $R$ finite causes the Biot number, $Bi = hR/(3k)$, to approach zero. The condition $Bi \\to 0$ represents the ideal case for the LCM, where internal conduction resistance is zero. In this physical limit, any heat removed from the surface is instantaneously replenished from the interior, ensuring the temperature throughout the sphere remains perfectly uniform at any given time, $T(t)$. Consequently, the full heat conduction model (Model i) must converge to the lumped capacitance model (Model ii). The temperature evolution for both models becomes identical and is described by the LCM solution, which features an exponential decay with a time constant $\\tau = \\frac{\\rho c R}{3h}$. This time constant is proportional to the group $(\\rho c R)/h$, with the proportionality constant being the geometric factor $1/3$. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2398043"}, {"introduction": "Having established how and when to use the lumped capacitance model, we now apply it to a dynamic situation.
