In the initial, inertia-dominated regime (short times), the object's speed is low, so the drag force is negligible compared to $F_0$. Let the speed in this regime be denoted by $v_{short}(t)$.\n2.  In the final, drag-dominated regime (long times), the object reaches a constant terminal speed as acceleration ceases. Let this terminal speed be denoted by $v_{long}$.\n\nA powerful technique in physics is to construct a composite approximate solution that is valid for all times by smoothly \"matching\" the solutions from different regimes.
