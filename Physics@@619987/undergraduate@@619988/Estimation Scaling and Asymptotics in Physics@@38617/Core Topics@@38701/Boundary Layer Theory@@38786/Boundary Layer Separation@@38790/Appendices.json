Separation is typically driven by an adverse pressure gradient, a condition where pressure increases in the direction of flow ($\\frac{dp}{dx} \\gt 0$), opposing the fluid's motion and potentially overwhelming its forward momentum near the wall. This practice explores this balance of forces in a tangible scenario, challenging you to determine the maximum adverse pressure gradient a gravity-driven film of fluid can sustain before it separates.", "problem": "A thin film of viscous liquid is used to cool a wide, flat component inside a power system. The component is a plate inclined at an angle $\\alpha$ with respect to the horizontal. The coolant, with a constant density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, flows down the plate in a steady, laminar manner, forming a layer of uniform thickness $h$. The primary driving force for the flow is gravity. However, due to the complex geometry of the system, a pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ exists along the direction of flow, where the coordinate $x$ is measured down the incline. An adverse pressure gradient (where pressure increases with $x$) can oppose the flow. If this adverse gradient is strong enough, the fluid near the plate surface can be brought to a halt, leading to flow separation, which is detrimental to the cooling process.\n\nAssuming the flow is fully developed and the film has a free surface exposed to a constant ambient pressure, determine the maximum possible adverse pressure gradient, $\\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right)_{\\text{max}}$, that this fluid layer can sustain before flow separation occurs at the plate surface.
