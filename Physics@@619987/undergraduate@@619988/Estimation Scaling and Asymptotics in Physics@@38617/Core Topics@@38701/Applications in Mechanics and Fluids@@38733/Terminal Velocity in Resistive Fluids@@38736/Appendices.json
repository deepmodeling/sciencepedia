For a sphere sinking in a fluid, there are three forces to consider: the gravitational force ($F_g$) acting downward, the buoyant force ($F_b$) acting upward, and the drag force ($F_d$) acting upward, opposing the motion.\n\nThe condition for terminal velocity, $v_T$, is:\n$$F_g = F_b + F_d$$\n\nLet's first establish a general expression for the terminal velocity of a sphere.\nThe gravitational force is $F_g = m g$, where $m$ is the mass of the sphere. We can write the mass as $m = \\rho_{\\text{avg}} V$, where $\\rho_{\\text{avg}}$ is the average density of the sphere and $V$ is its total volume.

Its terminal velocity, $v_{\\text{solid}}$, is:\n$$v_{\\text{solid}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 g R (\\rho_s - \\rho_w)}{3 C \\rho_w}}$$\n\nFor the hollow plastic sphere, we must first find its average density, $\\rho_{\\text{hollow, avg}}$. The average density is its total mass divided by its total volume.\nThe total volume is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$.\nThe mass of the hollow sphere is the mass of its plastic shell.

After a short time, it is observed to reach a constant terminal velocity, which we denote as $v_1$. The experiment is then repeated. This time, two identical steel bearings are dropped simultaneously from rest, aligned vertically, with the second (trailing) bearing located a small distance directly below the first (leading) bearing. It is observed that the pair of bearings eventually reaches a stable configuration, falling together at a new, constant terminal velocity $v_2$ while maintaining a fixed separation distance.\n\nAssume that the fluid flow around the bearings is laminar (i.e., corresponds to a low Reynolds number), and that any effects from the tank's walls are negligible. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate physical explanation for the relationship between $v_2$ and $v_1$?\n\nA. $v_2  v_1$. The leading sphere churns the fluid, increasing the effective drag on the trailing sphere, which must slow down to maintain force equilibrium. The leading sphere is in turn slowed down by the back-pressure from the trailing sphere.\n\nB. $v_2 = v_1$. The gravitational and buoyant forces on each sphere are unchanged, and since the spheres are identical, the drag force required for equilibrium must also be the same. Therefore, each sphere behaves as if it were isolated, falling at the same terminal velocity $v_1$.\n\nC. $v_2 > v_1$. The leading sphere drags the fluid in its immediate wake along with it in the direction of motion. The trailing sphere is therefore falling through a medium that is already moving downwards, which reduces its velocity relative to the fluid. A lower relative velocity results in a smaller drag force, so the sphere must fall at a higher absolute velocity $v_2$ to achieve the force balance required for terminal velocity.\n\nD. $v_2 > v_1$. The two spheres, when falling close together, disturb the fluid in a way that is similar to a single, larger, elongated object. Such an object has a more \"streamlined\" shape than a single sphere, leading to a reduction in the overall drag coefficient for the system and a higher terminal velocity.\n\nE. The relationship is unpredictable.

By symmetry in this colinear configuration, the leading sphere also experiences a positive downward induced flow from the trailing sphere, so both spheres share the same enhanced terminal speed $v_{2}$ while maintaining a fixed separation when other short-range effects enforce that separation.\n\nTherefore, at low Reynolds number, the physical mechanism is that the leading sphere entrains fluid in its disturbance field, so the trailing sphere falls through fluid already moving downward. This reduces its relative speed $v_{\\text{rel}} = v_{2} - u_{z}$ and hence the drag $6\\pi \\eta a\\, v_{\\text{rel}}$.
