This exercise challenges the common notion that an object denser than a liquid must sink, forcing us to consider an alternative means of support. By analyzing the conditions under which a solid cylinder can be supported entirely by surface tension forces, you will practice balancing a volumetric force (weight) against a force that acts along a line (surface tension), providing a clear and foundational example of the gravity-capillarity balance [@problem_id:1887908].", "problem": "A long, solid cylinder of length $L$ and diameter $D$, made of aluminum with density $\\rho_{Al}$, is gently placed on the horizontal surface of a large pool of liquid mercury.

The iconic spherical form of small bubbles and droplets is a direct consequence of surface tension minimizing surface energy. This practice asks you to investigate the point at which this perfect sphericity breaks down. You will compare the cohesive, shape-maintaining pressure of surface tension with the deforming pressure created by the hydrostatic gradient, discovering a fundamental length scale that universally separates the small, surface-tension-dominated world from the large, gravity-dominated one [@problem_id:1887894].", "problem": "An air bubble is released at the bottom of a large tank of molasses and begins to rise. For a very small bubble, the forces due to surface tension are dominant, pulling the bubble into a nearly perfect spherical shape to minimize surface area energy.
