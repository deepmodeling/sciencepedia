Many problems in physics involve estimating the change in a quantity due to a small change in a variable, and the simplest tool for this is the linear approximation derived from a first-order Taylor expansion. This exercise [@problem_id:1937097] allows you to quantify the error introduced by this simplification in the context of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for blackbody radiation, a key concept in thermodynamics. By calculating the truncation error directly, you will gain a concrete understanding of the higher-order terms that a linear model neglects.", "problem": "The total power $P$ radiated by a spherical blackbody is described by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that $P$ is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature $T$. An analyst wants to estimate the fractional change in power, defined as $\\frac{P_{final} - P_{initial}}{P_{initial}}$, that results from a small fractional increase in temperature, $\\delta = \\frac{T_{final} - T_{initial}}{T_{initial}}$. To do this, they employ a linear approximation based on the first-order Taylor expansion of the power function $P(T)$ around the initial temperature $T_{initial}$.\n\nSuppose the absolute temperature of the blackbody increases by exactly 2%. Calculate the truncation error of this linear estimation. The truncation error is defined as the exact fractional change in power minus the fractional change predicted by the linear approximation.\n\nExpress your answer as a dimensionless decimal value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the initial absolute temperature be $T_0$ and the initial radiated power be $P_0$. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the power $P$ is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature $T$. We can write this relationship as $P(T) = k T^4$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality that incorporates the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, the surface area, and the emissivity of the blackbody. The initial power is thus $P_0 = P(T_0) = k T_0^4$.\n\nThe problem states there is a fractional increase in temperature given by $\\delta = \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_0} = 0.02$, where $\\Delta T = T_{final} - T_0$. The final temperature is $T_{final} = T_0 + \\Delta T = T_0(1 + \\delta)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the exact fractional change in power.
