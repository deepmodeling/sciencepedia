An engineer performs an empirical study on the motor. For the intended low-speed operational range and neglecting complex effects like back-electromotive force, the torque $T(t)$ generated by the motor is found to be directly proportional to the square of the applied terminal voltage $v(t)$. This relationship is modeled by the equation $T(t) = k v^2(t)$, where $k$ is a positive motor torque constant.\n\nThe motor is connected to a load which, for simplicity, can be modeled as having a constant moment of inertia, $I$. The system of interest is defined with the applied voltage $v(t)$ as the input and the resulting angular acceleration $\\alpha(t)$ of the load as the output.\n\nA system is defined as linear if it satisfies the principle of superposition, which comprises two properties: additivity and homogeneity (scaling).\n- **Additivity**: If an input $v_1(t)$ produces an output $\\alpha_1(t)$ and an input $v_2(t)$ produces an output $\\alpha_2(t)$, then the input $v_1(t) + v_2(t)$ must produce the output $\\alpha_1(t) + \\alpha_2(t)$.\n- **Homogeneity**: If an input $v(t)$ produces an output $\\alpha(t)$, then for any scalar constant $c$, the input $c \\cdot v(t)$ must produce the output $c \\cdot \\alpha(t)$.\n\nBased on the model provided, which of the following statements correctly describes the linearity of the system relating the input voltage $v(t)$ to the output angular acceleration $\\alpha(t)$?\n\nA.

For the summed input, the output is\n$$\n\\alpha_{12}(t) = c_0 (v_1(t) + v_2(t))^2 = c_0(v_1^2(t) + 2 v_1(t) v_2(t) + v_2^2(t)).\n$$\nIn general,\n$$\n\\alpha_{12}(t) \\neq \\alpha_1(t) + \\alpha_2(t) = c_0 v_1^2(t) + c_0 v_2^2(t),\n$$\nbecause of the cross term $2 c_0 v_1(t) v_2(t)$. Therefore, additivity is violated.\n\nTest homogeneity.

Therefore, homogeneity is violated.\n\nSince both additivity and homogeneity are violated, the system is not linear. The mapping is time-invariant (coefficients are constant and the relation is memoryless), so time-variation is not the cause of nonlinearity.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that the system is not linear because it violates both additivity and homogeneity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1589745"}, {"introduction": "Once a system is identified as linear and time-invariant (LTI), the principle of superposition becomes a powerful computational tool.

The core principles we will use are linearity and time-invariance.\n\nFirst, we must express the rectangular pulse input, $x(t)$, as a linear combination of scaled and time-shifted unit step functions, $u(t)$. The input pulse $x(t)$ starts at $t=1$ with an amplitude of 3, which can be represented by a step function of magnitude 3 starting at $t=1$, i.e., $3u(t-1)$. The pulse ends at $t=4$, which means the signal goes back to zero. This can be achieved by subtracting a step function of magnitude 3 starting at $t=4$, i.e., $-3u(t-4)$. Combining these two, the input signal $x(t)$ can be written as:\n$$\nx(t) = 3u(t-1) - 3u(t-4)\n$$\n\nNext, we leverage the properties of the LTI system.
