The convergence of the full Taylor series does not preclude a truncated version from being a valid asymptotic series. In fact, many asymptotic series are derived from convergent Taylor series.\n- C is incorrect because our calculation shows the limit is 0, not a non-zero constant. A non-zero constant would mean $R_N(x)$ is of order $O(1/x^N)$, not $o(1/x^N)$.\n- D is incorrect. The remainder $R_4(x) \\approx -1/(720x^6)$, which clearly approaches zero as $x \\to \\infty$.\n- E is incorrect. An asymptotic approximation is generally not exact for any finite $x$. The limit of the difference $f(x)-S_4(x)$ is zero, but this does not mean it is exact.
