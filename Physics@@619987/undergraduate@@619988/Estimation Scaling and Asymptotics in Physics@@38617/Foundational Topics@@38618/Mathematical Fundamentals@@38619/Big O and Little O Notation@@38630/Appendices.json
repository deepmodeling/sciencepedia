The particle is attached to a linear spring with spring constant $k$ and is subject to a viscous damping force with a damping coefficient $b$. An external sinusoidal force, described by $F(t) = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$, drives the system. The equation of motion for the particle's displacement $x(t)$ from equilibrium is given by:\n$$m \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + b \\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nAfter a sufficient amount of time, the system settles into a steady-state oscillation with the same frequency as the driving force, such that $x_{ss}(t) = A(\\omega) \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta)$, where $A(\\omega)$ is the steady-state amplitude and $\\delta$ is a phase shift.\n\nFor very low driving frequencies, i.e., in the limit where $\\omega$ approaches zero, the amplitude can be accurately approximated by the expression:\n$$A(\\omega) \\approx A_0 (1 - C \\omega^2)$$\nHere, $A_0$ represents the non-zero, zero-frequency amplitude (the limit of $A(\\omega)$ as $\\omega \\to 0$), and $C$ is a coefficient that encapsulates the initial deviation from this static response.\n\nDetermine the analytic expression for the coefficient $C$ in terms of the physical parameters of the system: the mass $m$, the damping coefficient $b$, and the spring constant $k$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the coefficient $C$ in the low-frequency approximation of the steady-state amplitude of a driven, damped harmonic oscillator.\n\nFirst, we recall the standard formula for the steady-state amplitude $A(\\omega)$. For the given equation of motion, the amplitude is:\n$$A(\\omega) = \\frac{F_0/m}{\\sqrt{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (\\gamma \\omega)^2}}$$\nwhere $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{k/m}$ is the natural angular frequency of the undamped oscillator and $\\gamma = b/m$ is the damping ratio parameter. Substituting these back in terms of $m, b, k$:\n$$A(\\omega) = \\frac{F_0/m}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{k}{m} - \\omega^2\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{b}{m}\\omega\\right)^2}}$$\n\nThe problem defines $A_0$ as the zero-frequency amplitude, which is the limit of $A(\\omega)$ as $\\omega \\to 0$. We calculate this by substituting $\\omega=0$ into the expression for $A(\\omega)$:\n$$A_0 = \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} A(\\omega) = \\frac{F_0/m}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{k}{m} - 0\\right)^2 + 0}} = \\frac{F_0/m}{k/m} = \\frac{F_0}{k}$$\nThis result is physically intuitive: for a static force ($\\omega=0$), the spring displacement is simply the force divided by the spring constant, according to Hooke's Law.\n\nTo find the coefficient $C$, we need to analyze the behavior of $A(\\omega)$ for small $\\omega$. This is typically done by performing a Taylor expansion around $\\omega=0$. It is often easier to work with $A(\\omega)^2$ to eliminate the square root initially.\n$$A(\\omega)^2 = \\frac{(F_0/m)^2}{\\left(\\frac{k}{m} - \\omega^2\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{b}{m}\\omega\\right)^2}$$\nLet's expand the denominator:\n$$\\left(\\frac{k}{m} - \\omega^2\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{b}{m}\\omega\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{k^2}{m^2} - 2\\frac{k}{m}\\omega^2 + \\omega^4\\right) + \\frac{b^2}{m^2}\\omega^2 = \\frac{k^2}{m^2} + \\left(\\frac{b^2}{m^2} - \\frac{2k}{m}\\right)\\omega^2 + \\omega^4$$\nFor small $\\omega$, the $\\omega^4$ term is negligible compared to the $\\omega^2$ term.

Here, $x = \\left(\\frac{b^2 - 2mk}{k^2}\\right)\\omega^2$ and $n=-1$.\n$$A(\\omega)^2 \\approx A_0^2 \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{b^2 - 2mk}{k^2}\\right)\\omega^2\\right] = A_0^2 \\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{2mk - b^2}{k^2}\\right)\\omega^2\\right]$$\nNow, we take the square root of both sides to find $A(\\omega)$. We use the binomial approximation again, $\\sqrt{1+y} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}y$ for small $y$.

By comparing our derived expression with the given form, we can make the identification:\n$$-C = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2mk - b^2}{k^2}\\right)$$\nSolving for $C$, we get:\n$$C = -\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2mk - b^2}{k^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{b^2 - 2mk}{k^2}\\right) = \\frac{b^2 - 2mk}{2k^2}$$\nThus, the coefficient $C$ is a function of the system's mass, damping, and stiffness parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{b^2 - 2mk}{2k^2}}$$", "id": "1886097"}, {"introduction": "A key principle in physics is that quantum mechanics must reproduce classical results in the appropriate limit.
