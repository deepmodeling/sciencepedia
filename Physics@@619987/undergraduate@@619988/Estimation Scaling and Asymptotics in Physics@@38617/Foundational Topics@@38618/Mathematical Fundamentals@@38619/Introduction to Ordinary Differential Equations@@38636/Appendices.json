Consider one of the simplest such circuits, a \"constitutive gene expression\" module, implemented in a bacterium. In this module, a specific gene is continuously transcribed into messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) at a constant rate, denoted by $k$. Simultaneously, the mRNA molecules are actively degraded by enzymes within the cell. This degradation process is modeled as a first-order reaction, meaning the rate of decay is directly proportional to the current concentration of the mRNA, $m(t)$. The proportionality constant for this degradation is $\\gamma$. The net rate of change of the mRNA concentration over time is thus governed by the differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = k - \\gamma m(t)\n$$\n\nAssuming $k$ and $\\gamma$ are positive real constants, determine the general solution for the mRNA concentration, $m(t)$.

This is a common negative feedback motif called autorepression. The concentration of this protein, denoted by $P$, evolves over time according to the following ordinary differential equation, which represents a simplified model of the system's dynamics:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{k}{1+P} - \\gamma P\n$$\nIn this model, the term $\\frac{k}{1+P}$ describes the rate of protein production, which is repressed as the concentration $P$ increases.

We can rearrange the equation as follows:\n$$\n\\gamma P_{ss} = \\frac{k}{1+P_{ss}}\n$$\n\nNow, we multiply both sides by $(1+P_{ss})$ to clear the denominator.

The denominator $2\\gamma$ is positive. Thus, $P_{ss,2}$ is a negative value, which is not physically possible.\n\nFor the first solution, $P_{ss,1}$, let's analyze the term under the square root. Since $k > 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$, the term $4\\gamma k$ is positive. Therefore, $\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k > \\gamma^2$, and taking the square root gives $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2 + 4\\gamma k} > \\sqrt{\\gamma^2} = \\gamma$.
