In this model, the polymer is treated as a sequence of $N$ rigid monomer units, each of fixed length $l$. The chain starts at the origin of a one-dimensional coordinate system. The orientation of each monomer unit is random and independent of the others. Specifically, the $i$-th monomer unit represents a step $s_i$, which can be either $+l$ (to the right) or $-l$ (to the left), with equal probability for each choice. The total end-to-end vector of the polymer after $N$ steps is the final position $X$, given by the sum of the individual step vectors: $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i$. Determine the mean-square displacement of the end of the polymer chain from the origin.

This exercise challenges you to determine how the probability of a random walker returning to its starting point scales with the total number of steps, introducing the powerful idea of a scaling exponent. You will employ Stirling's approximation, a vital mathematical tool for physics, to reveal a fundamental law governing diffusion and other random processes [@problem_id:1885865].", "problem": "Consider a simplified one-dimensional model for the motion of a point defect within a long crystal lattice. The defect is initially located at a position we define as the origin, $x=0$. At discrete time intervals, the defect performs a hop to an adjacent lattice site, either to the right (position change of $+1$) or to the left (position change of $-1$). The direction of each hop is chosen randomly, with the probability of hopping right being equal to the probability of hopping left.\n\nLet $P(0, N)$ be the probability of finding the defect back at the origin after it has completed a total of $N$ hops. For a very large number of hops, $N \\gg 1$, this probability can be approximated by a power-law relationship of the form $P(0, N) \\propto N^{\\alpha}$.\n\nDetermine the value of the scaling exponent $\\alpha$.", "solution": "Let $n_R$ be the number of hops to the right and $n_L$ be the number of hops to the left. The total number of hops is $N = n_R + n_L$. For the defect to be at the origin after $N$ hops, its final position must be $x = (+1)n_R + (-1)n_L = 0$. This implies that $n_R = n_L$.\n\nSubstituting this condition into the expression for the total number of steps, we get $N = n_R + n_R = 2n_R$. This means that the total number of steps $N$ must be even for the defect to have a non-zero probability of returning to the origin. Let's define $n_R = n_L = N/2$.\n\nThis is a classic random walk problem, and the probability of a specific sequence of steps is governed by the binomial distribution. The probability of hopping right is $p=1/2$, and the probability of hopping left is $q=1/2$. The probability of any single specific sequence of $N/2$ right hops and $N/2$ left hops is $p^{N/2} q^{N/2} = (1/2)^{N/2} (1/2)^{N/2} = (1/2)^N$.\n\nThe number of distinct ways to arrange these $N/2$ right hops and $N/2$ left hops is given by the binomial coefficient \"N choose $n_R$\", which is $\\binom{N}{n_R} = \\binom{N}{N/2}$.\n\nTherefore, the total probability of being at the origin after $N$ hops, $P(0, N)$, is the product of the number of ways and the probability of one specific way:\n$$P(0, N) = \\binom{N}{N/2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^N$$\nThe binomial coefficient can be written in terms of factorials:\n$$P(0, N) = \\frac{N!}{(N/2)!(N/2)!} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^N$$\nThe problem states that $N$ is very large. We can therefore use Stirling's approximation for the factorial function, which is $n! \\approx \\sqrt{2\\pi n} \\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n$ for large $n$.\n\nLet's apply this approximation to the factorials in our expression:\n- $N! \\approx \\sqrt{2\\pi N} \\left(\\frac{N}{e}\\right)^N$\n- $(N/2)! \\approx \\sqrt{2\\pi (N/2)} \\left(\\frac{N/2}{e}\\right)^{N/2} = \\sqrt{\\pi N} \\left(\\frac{N}{2e}\\right)^{N/2}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the binomial coefficient and simplifying:\n$$\n\\binom{N}{N/2} \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi N} \\left(\\frac{N}{e}\\right)^N}{\\left(\\sqrt{\\pi N} \\left(\\frac{N}{2e}\\right)^{N/2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi N} (N/e)^N}{\\pi N (N/2e)^N} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi N}}{\\pi N} \\cdot 2^N = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi N}} \\cdot 2^N\n$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the probability formula for $P(0, N)$:\n$$\nP(0, N) \\approx \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi N}} \\cdot 2^N\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^N = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi N}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} N^{-1/2}\n$$\nSo, for large $N$, the probability is given by:\n$$P(0, N) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} N^{-1/2}$$\nThe problem states that the probability scales as $P(0, N) \\propto N^{\\alpha}$.
