A classic example is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which states that the power $P$ radiated by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, $T^4$. While this relationship is exact, for small fluctuations around a stable operating temperature, we can often simplify the problem by finding a linear approximation. This practice guides you through using a first-order Maclaurin expansion to model the change in radiated power from a star due to a small temperature increase, a core technique used in perturbation analysis across many fields of physics [@problem_id:1914400].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a star, which radiates energy similar to an ideal blackbody. The total power, $P$, radiated by the star is described by the equation $P(T) = k T^4$, where $T$ is the absolute surface temperature and $k$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on the star's properties. Suppose the star's surface temperature undergoes a small fluctuation, increasing from its initial stable value $T_0$.
