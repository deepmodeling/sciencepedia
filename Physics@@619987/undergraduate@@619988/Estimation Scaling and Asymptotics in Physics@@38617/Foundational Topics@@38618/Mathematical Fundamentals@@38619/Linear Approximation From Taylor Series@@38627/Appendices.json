We start by analyzing the forces acting on the train on a banked curve. Let the mass of the train be $m$. The two forces are gravity, $F_g = mg$, acting vertically downwards, and the normal force, $N$, acting perpendicular to the banked track surface.\n\nWe decompose the normal force into its horizontal and vertical components. The angle of the bank with the horizontal is $\\theta$. The vertical component of the normal force is $N\\cos\\theta$, and the horizontal component is $N\\sin\\theta$.\n\nFor the train to maintain a constant vertical height, the net vertical force must be zero. This gives us the equation:\n$$N\\cos\\theta - mg = 0 \\implies N\\cos\\theta = mg$$\n\nThe horizontal component of the normal force provides the necessary centripetal force, $F_c = ma_c$, required for the train to move in a circular path of radius $R$ at speed $v$.
