They postulate that the failure of the material under tensile stress is initiated by the unstable propagation of pre-existing microscopic cracks. Their goal is to find a relationship for the critical applied stress, $\\sigma_f$, that causes a crack of initial length $a$ to grow catastrophically. The material is characterized by its Young's modulus, $E$, and its surface fracture energy, $\\gamma$, which is the energy required to create a unit area of new surface.\n\nThe team's theoretical model is based on two key hypotheses derived from preliminary investigations:\n\n1.  The physics of fracture initiation is entirely confined to a small \"process zone\" at the tip of the crack. The characteristic size of this zone, denoted by a length scale $l_p$, is a fundamental material property determined exclusively by the interplay between the material's bulk elasticity (represented by $E$) and its surface cohesion (represented by $\\gamma$).\n\n2.  Global failure occurs when the average elastic energy density within this process zone, $u_{zone}$, reaches a critical, material-dependent value, $u_{crit}$. The team's simulations show that $u_{crit}$ is directly proportional to the material's Young's modulus. Furthermore, for a crack of length $a$ subjected to the critical stress $\\sigma_f$, the energy density within the zone is found to scale according to the relationship $u_{zone} \\propto \\frac{\\sigma_f^2 a}{E l_p}$.\n\nUsing only dimensional analysis and the physical constraints imposed by these two hypotheses, determine the functional form of the critical stress $\\sigma_f$ in terms of Young's modulus $E$, surface fracture energy $\\gamma$, and crack length $a$. Express your answer up to a single dimensionless constant of proportionality, which you should denote as $C$.", "solution": "The problem asks for an expression for the critical stress $\\sigma_f$ as a function of $E$, $\\gamma$, and $a$, based on two specific hypotheses and dimensional analysis. We will address each hypothesis in turn to build the final relationship.\n\nFirst, let's list the dimensions of the relevant physical quantities in terms of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$):\n- Stress $\\sigma_f$ and Young's Modulus $E$ have dimensions of pressure (Force/Area): $[\\sigma_f] = [E] = \\frac{MLT^{-2}}{L^2} = ML^{-1}T^{-2}$.\n- Surface fracture energy $\\gamma$ has dimensions of energy per unit area: $[\\gamma] = \\frac{ML^2T^{-2}}{L^2} = MT^{-2}$.\n- Crack length $a$ and process zone size $l_p$ have dimensions of length: $[a] = [l_p] = L$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Hypothesis 1**\n\nHypothesis 1 states that the process zone size $l_p$ is a function of only $E$ and $\\gamma$. We can express this relationship as a power-law, up to a dimensionless constant $k_1$:\n$$l_p = k_1 E^\\alpha \\gamma^\\beta$$\nNow, we perform dimensional analysis by substituting the dimensions of each quantity into the equation:\n$$[l_p] = [E]^\\alpha [\\gamma]^\\beta$$\n$$L^1 = (ML^{-1}T^{-2})^\\alpha (MT^{-2})^\\beta$$\n$$M^0 L^1 T^0 = M^{\\alpha+\\beta} L^{-\\alpha} T^{-2\\alpha-2\\beta}$$\n\nTo satisfy this dimensional equality, we must equate the exponents of each fundamental dimension ($M$, $L$, $T$) on both sides of the equation. This gives us a system of linear equations for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n1.  For mass ($M$): $0 = \\alpha + \\beta$\n2.  For length ($L$): $1 = -\\alpha$\n3.  For time ($T$): $0 = -2\\alpha - 2\\beta$, which simplifies to $0 = \\alpha + \\beta$. This is the same as the first equation.\n\nFrom equation (2), we find $\\alpha = -1$.\nSubstituting this into equation (1), we get $0 = -1 + \\beta$, which gives $\\beta = 1$.\n\nSo, the relationship for the process zone size is:\n$$l_p = k_1 E^{-1} \\gamma^1 = k_1 \\frac{\\gamma}{E}$$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Hypothesis 2**\n\nHypothesis 2 provides the failure criterion. It states that failure occurs when $u_{zone} = u_{crit}$. Let's analyze the two parts of this condition.\n\n- The critical energy density $u_{crit}$ is directly proportional to the Young's modulus $E$. Let's write this with a dimensionless constant of proportionality $k_2$:\n$$u_{crit} = k_2 E$$\nNote that this is dimensionally consistent, as both energy density (Energy/Volume, $ML^2T^{-2}/L^3$) and pressure/modulus ($ML^{-1}T^{-2}$) have the same dimensions.\n\n- The energy density in the zone, $u_{zone}$, is given by the scaling law $u_{zone} \\propto \\frac{\\sigma_f^2 a}{E l_p}$. Let's write this with a dimensionless constant of proportionality $k_3$:\n$$u_{zone} = k_3 \\frac{\\sigma_f^2 a}{E l_p}$$\n\nThe failure condition is $u_{zone} = u_{crit}$ at the critical stress $\\sigma_f$. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions:\n$$k_3 \\frac{\\sigma_f^2 a}{E l_p} = k_2 E$$\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Results**\n\nNow we solve the equation from Step 2 for the critical stress $\\sigma_f$:\n$$\\sigma_f^2 = \\frac{k_2}{k_3} \\frac{E^2 l_p}{a}$$\n\nWe have an expression for $\\sigma_f$ that depends on $l_p$. We now substitute the expression for $l_p$ that we derived in Step 1:\n$$\\sigma_f^2 = \\frac{k_2}{k_3} \\frac{E^2}{a} \\left( k_1 \\frac{\\gamma}{E} \\right)$$\n\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$\\sigma_f^2 = \\left( \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_3} \\right) \\frac{E \\gamma}{a}$$\n\n**Step 4: Final Expression**\n\nTo find $\\sigma_f$, we take the square root of both sides:\n$$\\sigma_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_3}} \\sqrt{\\frac{E \\gamma}{a}}$$\n\nThe term $\\sqrt{\\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_3}}$ is a combination of three unknown dimensionless constants. We can combine them into a single, overall dimensionless constant of proportionality, $C$, as requested by the problem.\n$$C = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_3}}$$\n\nTherefore, the final functional form for the critical stress is:\n$$\\sigma_f = C \\sqrt{\\frac{E \\gamma}{a}}$$\nThis is the celebrated Griffith criterion for brittle fracture, derived here through a non-standard path involving abstract hypotheses and dimensional analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C \\sqrt{\\frac{E \\gamma}{a}}}$$", "id": "2186892"}]}
