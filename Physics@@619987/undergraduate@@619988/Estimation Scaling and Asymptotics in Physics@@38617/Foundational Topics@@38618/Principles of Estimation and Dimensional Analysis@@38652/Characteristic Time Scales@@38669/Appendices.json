This first practice explores the characteristic decay time of a damped harmonic oscillator using the familiar example of a car's suspension system after hitting a bump. By calculating the time it takes for oscillations to reduce to $1/e$ of their initial amplitude, you will apply the core principles of damped motion to a concrete engineering problem [@problem_id:1890700].", "problem": "An automotive engineer is analyzing the performance of a suspension system for a new vehicle. The system at each of the four wheels can be modeled as a simple damped harmonic oscillator. The total mass of the car is $M = 1600 \\text{ kg}$, and it is assumed to be distributed equally among the four wheels.\n\nTo determine the spring constant $k$ for a single suspension spring, a static test is performed. When an additional load of mass $m_L = 100 \\text{ kg}$ is placed directly over one wheel, the car body at that corner is observed to lower by a distance of $d = 2.50 \\text{ cm}$.\n\nThe shock absorber is designed to provide underdamped oscillations with a damping ratio of $\\zeta = 0.300$. The damping ratio is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the level of damping in a system.\n\nAfter the car drives over a small speed bump, the body at one corner oscillates vertically. Calculate the characteristic decay time of these oscillations, which is defined as the time it takes for the oscillation amplitude to decrease to $1/e$ of its initial value.

In this exercise, you will step into the role of a geophysicist to determine the time scale for post-glacial rebound, the slow uplift of Earth's crust after an ice age. This practice will challenge you to derive a characteristic time by balancing the driving buoyancy forces with the resistive viscous forces of the Earth's mantle, a key skill for analyzing complex systems [@problem_id:1890679].", "problem": "During an ice age, the immense weight of a continental ice sheet, with a characteristic horizontal scale $L$, causes the Earth's crust to be depressed into the underlying mantle. The mantle can be modeled as an extremely viscous fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\eta$ and density $\\rho_m$. After the ice sheet melts, the crust begins to rebound to its equilibrium position. This process, known as post-glacial rebound, is governed by the slow, viscous \"creep flow\" of the mantle material back into the region beneath the rising crust. The driving force for this uplift is the buoyancy from the displaced mantle. Assume the gravitational acceleration is $g$.\n\nUsing physical reasoning and dimensional analysis, derive a symbolic expression for the characteristic time scale, $\\tau$, of this isostatic rebound. Your expression should be in terms of $\\eta$, $\\rho_m$, $g$, and $L$.", "solution": "We model the mantle as a creeping (Stokes) viscous flow with dynamic viscosity $\\eta$ and density $\\rho_{m}$ under gravity $g$, and take $L$ as the characteristic horizontal length scale of the rebound. Because the Reynolds number is negligible, inertia can be ignored and the momentum balance reduces to the Stokes equation\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} = -\\nabla p + \\eta \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{u} + \\rho_{m}\\mathbf{g},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field and $p$ the pressure. The post-glacial rebound is driven by buoyancy associated with the displaced mantle. For scaling purposes, the buoyancy force per unit volume providing the driving is of order $\\rho_{m} g$, while viscous resistance is set by the Laplacian term with magnitude $\\eta U/L^{2}$, where $U$ is a characteristic velocity over the scale $L$.\n\nBalancing the dominant terms in the Stokes equation in magnitude gives\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta U}{L^{2}} \\sim \\rho_{m} g,\n$$\nwhich yields the characteristic velocity scale\n$$\nU \\sim \\frac{\\rho_{m} g L^{2}}{\\eta}.\n$$\nThe characteristic adjustment time is the time to advect over the length $L$ at speed $U$, so\n$$\n\\tau \\sim \\frac{L}{U} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{\\rho_{m} g L}.\n$$\nA cross-check using stress balance gives the same scaling: the buoyancy (driving) stress over scale $L$ is $\\sigma_{b} \\sim \\rho_{m} g L$, while the viscous (resisting) stress is $\\sigma_{v} \\sim \\eta U/L$.
