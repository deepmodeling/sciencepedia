A critical design parameter is the aerodynamic lift force, $F_L$, which counteracts gravity to keep the drone airborne. The team hypothesizes that this force is primarily dependent on three physical quantities: the density of the surrounding air, $\\rho$; the forward velocity of the drone relative to the air, $v$; and the total surface area of its wings, $A$. The functional relationship is assumed to be a power-law of the form:\n$$F_L = C \\rho^x v^y A^z$$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant of proportionality, known as the lift coefficient, and $x$, $y$, and $z$ are constant exponents that must be determined.

This means the dimensions on the left-hand side of the equation must be equal to the dimensions on the right-hand side. We will use the fundamental dimensions of Mass ($M$), Length ($L$), and Time ($T$).\n\nFirst, let's write down the dimensions of each physical quantity involved in the equation.\nThe lift force, $F_L$, is a force. According to Newton's second law ($F=ma$), the dimension of force is mass times acceleration.\n$$[F_L] = [m] \\cdot [a] = M \\cdot \\frac{L}{T^2} = M L T^{-2}$$\n\nThe density, $\\rho$, is mass per unit volume.\n$$[\\rho] = \\frac{[mass]}{[volume]} = \\frac{M}{L^3} = M L^{-3}$$\n\nThe velocity, $v$, is distance per unit time.\n$$[v] = \\frac{[distance]}{[time]} = \\frac{L}{T} = L T^{-1}$$\n\nThe area, $A$, is length squared.\n$$[A] = L^2$$\n\nThe constant, $C$, is stated to be dimensionless.\n$$[C] = 1$$\n\nNow, we substitute these dimensions into the given equation $F_L = C \\rho^x v^y A^z$:\n$$[F_L] = [C] [\\rho]^x [v]^y [A]^z$$\n$$M^1 L^1 T^{-2} = (1) \\cdot (M L^{-3})^x \\cdot (L T^{-1})^y \\cdot (L^2)^z$$\n\nNext, we distribute the exponents on the right-hand side:\n$$M^1 L^1 T^{-2} = (M^x L^{-3x}) \\cdot (L^y T^{-y}) \\cdot (L^{2z})$$\n\nNow, we group the terms with the same base dimensions ($M$, $L$, and $T$) by adding their exponents:\n$$M^1 L^1 T^{-2} = M^x L^{-3x + y + 2z} T^{-y}$$\n\nFor the equation to be dimensionally consistent, the exponent of each fundamental dimension on the left side must equal the corresponding exponent on the right side. This gives us a system of three linear equations for $x$, $y$, and $z$.\n\nEquating the exponents for Mass ($M$):\n$$1 = x$$\n\nEquating the exponents for Time ($T$):\n$$-2 = -y \\implies y = 2$$\n\nEquating the exponents for Length ($L$):\n$$1 = -3x + y + 2z$$\n\nWe have already found $x=1$ and $y=2$. We can substitute these values into the equation for the length dimension to solve for $z$:\n$$1 = -3(1) + (2) + 2z$$\n$$1 = -3 + 2 + 2z$$\n$$1 = -1 + 2z$$\n$$2 = 2z$$\n$$z = 1$$\n\nSo, the exponents are $x=1$, $y=2$, and $z=1$.\n\nFinally, we substitute these exponents back into the original expression for the lift force:\n$$F_L = C \\rho^1 v^2 A^1$$\n$$F_L = C \\rho v^2 A$$\n\nThis is the dimensionally consistent expression for the lift force based on the given parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C \\rho v^{2} A}$$", "id": "1921703"}, {"introduction": "Once a scaling relationship is established through dimensional analysis, it becomes a powerful tool for predicting how a system's behavior changes when its parameters are altered.
