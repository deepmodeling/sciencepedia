The tether, a long uniform cylindrical cable, must hang vertically from a surface vessel and support its own weight in the air before being deployed into the water. The material selected for the cable is a state-of-the-art high-strength steel alloy. For this preliminary structural analysis, the following properties of the steel are provided: its ultimate tensile strength is $\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = 1.25$ Gigapascals (GPa), and its density is $\\rho = 7850 \\text{ kg/m}^3$. Assume the cable has a uniform cross-sectional area along its entire length and hangs in a region where the acceleration due to gravity is $g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$.
