This transition occurs when the physical mechanisms driving convection become comparable to the mechanisms that suppress it. The primary driving mechanism is buoyancy, while the suppressing mechanisms are viscous dissipation and thermal diffusion. We can find the critical thickness by comparing the characteristic timescales of these processes.\n\nLet's identify the relevant timescales.\nFirst, consider the timescale for heat to diffuse across the fluid layer of thickness $h$. This is the thermal diffusion time, $\\tau_{diff}$. From the definition of thermal diffusivity $\\kappa$ (which has units of length squared per time), this timescale can be estimated as:\n$$\n\\tau_{diff} \\sim \\frac{h^{2}}{\\kappa}\n$$\nThis represents the time it would take for a temperature change to propagate across the layer via conduction. For convection to start, a parcel of fluid must be able to move across the layer faster than heat can diffuse away from it.\n\nSecond, let's determine the timescale for a parcel of fluid to move across the layer due to convection. This is the convective overturn time, $\\tau_{conv}$, which can be written as:\n$$\n\\tau_{conv} \\sim \\frac{h}{v_{conv}}\n$$\nwhere $v_{conv}$ is the characteristic velocity of the convective fluid motion.\n\nTo find $v_{conv}$, we must consider the forces acting on a parcel of fluid. A parcel of fluid at the bottom of the layer is hotter and thus less dense than the fluid above it. This density difference results in an upward buoyant force. The motion is opposed by a viscous drag force. The characteristic convective velocity is reached when these two forces are in balance.\n\nLet's consider a fluid parcel of characteristic size $h$. Its volume is $V \\sim h^3$.\nThe density difference, $\\Delta \\rho$, between this hot parcel and the cooler ambient fluid is given by the coefficient of thermal expansion $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\rho} \\approx \\alpha \\Delta T \\implies \\Delta \\rho \\sim \\rho \\alpha \\Delta T\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the average density of the fluid.\n\nThe buoyant force, $F_B$, on the parcel is the difference in gravitational force between the parcel and the displaced fluid:\n$$\nF_B = (\\Delta \\rho) V g \\sim (\\rho \\alpha \\Delta T) h^{3} g\n$$\n\nThe viscous drag force, $F_V$, opposes this motion. It depends on the fluid's viscosity, the size of the parcel, and the velocity gradient. The dynamic viscosity is $\\eta = \\rho \\nu$. The viscous force can be estimated as:\n$$\nF_V \\sim \\eta \\times (\\text{velocity gradient}) \\times (\\text{area}) \\sim (\\rho \\nu) \\left(\\frac{v_{conv}}{h}\\right) (h^2) = \\rho \\nu v_{conv} h\n$$\n\nAt the onset of steady convection, the buoyant force is balanced by the viscous drag force, $F_B \\sim F_V$:\n$$\n\\rho \\alpha g \\Delta T h^{3} \\sim \\rho \\nu v_{conv} h\n$$\nWe can solve this for the characteristic convective velocity $v_{conv}$:\n$$\nv_{conv} \\sim \\frac{\\alpha g \\Delta T h^{2}}{\\nu}\n$$\n\nNow we substitute this expression for $v_{conv}$ back into our equation for the convective timescale $\\tau_{conv}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{conv} \\sim \\frac{h}{v_{conv}} \\sim \\frac{h}{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha g \\Delta T h^{2}}{\\nu}\\right)} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha g \\Delta T h}\n$$\n\nThe onset of convection occurs when the convective timescale becomes comparable to or shorter than the thermal diffusion timescale.
