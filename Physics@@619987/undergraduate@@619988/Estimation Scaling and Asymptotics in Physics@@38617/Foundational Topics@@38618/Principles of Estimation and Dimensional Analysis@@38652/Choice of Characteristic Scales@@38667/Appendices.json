If the pinhole is too large, the image is blurry due to geometric effects; if it's too small, diffraction blurs the image. This exercise guides you to find the optimal aperture diameter where these two competing effects are balanced, a fundamental concept in optical design [@problem_id:1891031].", "problem": "A pinhole camera is a simple optical device that forms an image without a lens. It consists of an opaque screen containing a small circular aperture of diameter $d$, with a parallel image plane located a distance $L$ behind the aperture. The camera is used to observe a very distant point source of monochromatic light of wavelength $\\lambda$.\n\nThe sharpness of the image formed on the plane is governed by a trade-off between geometric blurring and diffraction. If the aperture is excessively large, the image of the point source is simply a blurred circle with a diameter equal to the aperture's diameter, $d$. Conversely, if the aperture is very small, diffraction effects become dominant. In this case, the light passing through the aperture spreads out, forming an image of the point source that is a bright circular spot (the Airy disk) surrounded by fainter concentric rings. For the purpose of this problem, you may use the approximation that the angular radius of this central bright spot is given by $\\theta_{\\text{diff}} \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{d}$.\n\nDetermine the characteristic aperture diameter, which we will call $d_{\\text{opt}}$, for which the physical diameter of the central diffraction spot on the image plane is exactly equal to the geometric diameter of the aperture itself.
