This can be found by calculating the number of photons absorbed by a single average spectator and multiplying it by the total number of spectators.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Energy of a single photon**\nFirst, we calculate the energy of a single photon, $E_{photon}$, with wavelength $\\lambda$. The relationship is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$E_{photon} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n**Step 2: Total number of photons emitted by the flash**\nThe flash emits a total energy of $E_{flash}$.

The spectators are located on the inner surface of a hemisphere of radius $R$. The surface area of this hemisphere is $A_{stadium} = 2\\pi R^2$. The number of photons passing through a unit area at this distance, known as the photon flux $\\sigma_{photons}$, is the total number of photons divided by the area they are spread over.\n$$\\sigma_{photons} = \\frac{N_{flash}}{A_{stadium}} = \\frac{E_{flash} \\lambda}{hc (2\\pi R^2)}$$\n\n**Step 4: Number of photons entering a single spectator's eye**\nEach spectator's eye presents a circular area, the pupil, to the incoming light. The area of one pupil, $A_{pupil}$, with diameter $d_{pupil}$ is:\n$$A_{pupil} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d_{pupil}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d_{pupil}^2}{4}$$\nThe number of photons entering a single pupil, $N_{enter}$, is the photon flux multiplied by the pupil's area. We assume for this estimation that each spectator is looking towards the flash with one eye, or that $A_{pupil}$ is the effective collecting area per person.\n$$N_{enter} = \\sigma_{photons} \\times A_{pupil} = \\left(\\frac{E_{flash} \\lambda}{2\\pi hc R^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\pi d_{pupil}^2}{4}\\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$N_{enter} = \\frac{E_{flash} \\lambda d_{pupil}^2}{8 hc R^2}$$\n\n**Step 5: Number of photons absorbed by a single retina**\nThe retina does not absorb every photon that enters the eye. Its efficiency is given by $\\eta_{abs}$. The number of photons absorbed by a single spectator's retina, $N_{abs\\_person}$, is:\n$$N_{abs\\_person} = N_{enter} \\times \\eta_{abs} = \\frac{E_{flash} \\lambda d_{pupil}^2 \\eta_{abs}}{8 hc R^2}$$\n\n**Step 6: Total photons absorbed by the entire audience**\nFinally, the total number of photons collectively absorbed by the entire audience of $N_{people}$ spectators is the number absorbed per person multiplied by the number of people.\n$$N_{collective} = N_{people} \\times N_{abs\\_person} = N_{people} \\frac{E_{flash} \\lambda d_{pupil}^2 \\eta_{abs}}{8 hc R^2}$$\n\n**Step 7: Numerical calculation**\nNow we substitute the given values into our final expression.
