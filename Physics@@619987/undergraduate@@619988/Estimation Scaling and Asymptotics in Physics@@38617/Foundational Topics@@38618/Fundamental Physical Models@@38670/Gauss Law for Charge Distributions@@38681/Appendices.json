The second sheet, located at the plane $z=d$, has a uniform positive surface charge density of $+3\\sigma$. A particle of mass $m$ and negative charge $-q$ (where $q > 0$) is released from rest at a position infinitesimally close to the surface of the first sheet (at $z=0$). The particle is then accelerated by the electric field between the sheets. Assume that the sheets are large enough to be treated as infinite planes and that gravitational effects are negligible.

We can solve this by first finding the net electric field in the region between the sheets and then using the work-energy theorem to find the particle's final speed.\n\nFirst, let's determine the electric field produced by a single infinite sheet of charge. By applying Gauss's law to a pillbox-shaped Gaussian surface that pierces the sheet, we find that the magnitude of the electric field produced by a sheet with surface charge density $\\eta$ is constant and given by $E = \\frac{|\\eta|}{2\\epsilon_0}$. The field is directed away from a positively charged sheet and towards a negatively charged one.\n\nThe total electric field in the region between the two sheets ($0 < z < d$) is the vector sum (superposition) of the fields produced by each sheet individually.
