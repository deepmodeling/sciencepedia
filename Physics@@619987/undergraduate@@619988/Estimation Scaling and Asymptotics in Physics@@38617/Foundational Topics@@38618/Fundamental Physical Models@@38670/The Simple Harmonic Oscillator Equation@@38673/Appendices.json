The buoy is tethered to a point on the seabed by a light, elastic cable. The cable is attached to the center of the buoy's bottom face and behaves like an ideal spring with a spring constant $k$ and natural (unstretched) length $L_0$.\n\nAssume the system is in stable equilibrium with the buoy floating upright and the cable taut and perfectly vertical.

The depth $D$ is greater than the cable's natural length $L_0$.\n\nIf the buoy is given a small vertical nudge downwards from its equilibrium position and then released, it will oscillate vertically.
