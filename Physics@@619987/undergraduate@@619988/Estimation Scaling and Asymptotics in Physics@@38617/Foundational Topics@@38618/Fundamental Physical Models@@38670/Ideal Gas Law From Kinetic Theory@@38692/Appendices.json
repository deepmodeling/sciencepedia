Consider a container filled with air at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP). For the purposes of this problem, we will define STP as a temperature of $T = 273.15 \\text{ K}$ and a pressure of $P = 101325 \\text{ Pa}$.\n\nWe will model air as a single-component ideal gas with an effective molar mass of $M = 28.97 \\text{ g/mol}$. To simplify the calculation, we use a simplified kinetic model:\n1.  All molecules move with the same speed, equal to the root-mean-square speed, $v_{rms}$.\n2.  At any given moment, exactly one-sixth of the molecules are moving in the $+x$ direction, one-sixth in the $-x$ direction, one-sixth in the $+y$ direction, and so on for $-y$, $+z$, and $-z$. Molecules do not move in any other direction.\n3.  All collisions with the container walls are perfectly elastic.\n\nUsing this model, calculate the total magnitude of the momentum imparted by the air molecules to a square patch of the container wall with an area of $A = 1.00 \\text{ cm}^2$ over a time interval of $\\Delta t = 1.00 \\text{ s}$.
