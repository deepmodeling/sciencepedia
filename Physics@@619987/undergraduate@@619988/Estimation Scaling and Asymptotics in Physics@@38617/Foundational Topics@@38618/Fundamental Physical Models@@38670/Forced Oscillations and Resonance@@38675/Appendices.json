The core sensing element of the device is modeled as a simple pendulum, consisting of a small, dense mass $m$ attached to a rigid, massless rod of length $L$. The pendulum's pivot is fixed to the device casing, and its motion is confined to a single vertical plane. To suppress spurious vibrations, the pendulum is immersed in a viscous fluid that exerts a damping force on the mass. For the small oscillations expected, this damping force can be accurately described by the linear model $F_{damp} = -bv$, where $b$ is the damping constant and $v$ is the tangential velocity of the mass.\n\nDuring a seismic event, the ground, and thus the device casing, experiences small horizontal vibrations. This motion effectively applies a periodic horizontal driving force $F(t) = F_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$ to the pendulum's mass. The sensitivity of the detector for a given ground motion frequency $\\omega$ is directly proportional to the amplitude of the pendulum's steady-state angular displacement. To optimize the design for maximum sensitivity, the engineers must identify the driving frequency that produces the largest possible angular displacement amplitude.\n\nAssuming the pendulum undergoes only small angular displacements, determine the driving frequency $\\omega$ that leads to the resonance of the angular displacement amplitude.
