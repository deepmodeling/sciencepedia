The formula for the moment of inertia is $I = \\int r^2 \\, dm$, where $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation. In our case, $r=x$.\n$$I = \\int_{0}^{L} x^2 \\, dm = \\int_{0}^{L} x^2 (\\lambda(x) \\,dx) = \\int_{0}^{L} x^2(cx) \\,dx = c \\int_{0}^{L} x^3 \\,dx$$\n$$I = c \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{cL^4}{4}$$\n\nNow we have all the components needed to calculate the period $T$.
