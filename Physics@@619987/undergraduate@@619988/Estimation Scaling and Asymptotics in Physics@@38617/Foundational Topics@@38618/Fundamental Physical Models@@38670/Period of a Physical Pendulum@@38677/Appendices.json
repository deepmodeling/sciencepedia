The pivot is at one end of the rod, which we can set as the origin a coordinate system. The rod extends from $0$ to $L$.\n\n1.  **Total Mass ($M_{tot}$):**\n    The total mass is the sum of the mass of the rod ($M$) and the mass of the bead ($m$).\n    $$ M_{tot} = M + m $$\n\n2.  **Center of Mass ($d$):**\n    The center of mass of the uniform rod is at its geometric center, $x_{rod} = L/2$.

The center of mass of the combined system, $d=x_{CM}$, is given by:\n    $$ d = x_{CM}(x) = \\frac{M x_{rod} + m x}{M + m} = \\frac{M(L/2) + mx}{M+m} $$\n\n3.  **Total Moment of Inertia ($I$):**\n    The moment of inertia of a uniform rod of mass $M$ and length $L$ about an axis through one of its ends is $I_{rod} = \\frac{1}{3}ML^2$. The bead of mass $m$ is treated as a point mass at a distance $x$ from the pivot, so its moment of inertia is $I_{bead} = mx^2$. The total moment of inertia $I$ is the sum of these two:\n    $$ I(x) = I_{rod} + I_{bead} = \\frac{1}{3}ML^2 + mx^2 $$\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the period $T$ as a function of $x$. To simplify the process of finding the maximum, we can work with the square of the period, $T^2$. Maximizing $T$ is equivalent to maximizing $T^2$.\n$$ T^2(x) = (2\\pi)^2 \\frac{I(x)}{M_{tot} g x_{CM}(x)} = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{g} \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}ML^2 + mx^2}{(M+m) \\frac{M(L/2) + mx}{M+m}} $$\n$$ T^2(x) = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{g} \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}ML^2 + mx^2}{ML/2 + mx} $$\nTo find the value of $x$ that maximizes $T(x)$, we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative of $T^2(x)$ with respect to $x$ and setting it to zero. Let $K = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{g}$ be a constant. Let $f(x) = \\frac{T^2(x)}{K} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}ML^2 + mx^2}{ML/2 + mx}$. We use the quotient rule for differentiation, $(u/v)' = (u'v - uv')/v^2$.\nLet $u(x) = \\frac{1}{3}ML^2 + mx^2$ and $v(x) = ML/2 + mx$.\nThen $u'(x) = 2mx$ and $v'(x) = m$.\n\nThe derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{(2mx)(ML/2 + mx) - (\\frac{1}{3}ML^2 + mx^2)(m)}{(ML/2 + mx)^2} $$\nSetting the numerator to zero to find the critical points:\n$$ (2mx)(ML/2 + mx) - m\\left(\\frac{1}{3}ML^2 + mx^2\\right) = 0 $$\nSince $m>0$, we can divide the equation by $m$:\n$$ 2x(ML/2 + mx) - \\left(\\frac{1}{3}ML^2 + mx^2\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ MLx + 2mx^2 - \\frac{1}{3}ML^2 - mx^2 = 0 $$\n$$ mx^2 + MLx - \\frac{1}{3}ML^2 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x$. We are given that $m = M/2$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{M}{2}x^2 + MLx - \\frac{1}{3}ML^2 = 0 $$\nDividing by $M$ (since $M>0$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + Lx - \\frac{1}{3}L^2 = 0 $$\nWe solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ x = \\frac{-L \\pm \\sqrt{L^2 - 4(\\frac{1}{2})(-\\frac{1}{3}L^2)}}{2(\\frac{1}{2})} = -L \\pm \\sqrt{L^2 + \\frac{2}{3}L^2} = -L \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{3}}L $$\nSince $x$ must be a physical distance, it must be positive ($x \\ge 0$). Thus we take the positive root:\n$$ x_c = L(\\sqrt{5/3} - 1) \\approx L(1.291 - 1) = 0.291L $$\nThis critical point $x_c$ is within our domain $[0, L]$. Now we must determine if this is a maximum, a minimum, or a saddle point. We can check the second derivative of $f(x)$, or more simply, analyze the sign of the first derivative. The numerator of the derivative is the quadratic function $P(x) = mx^2 + MLx - \\frac{1}{3}ML^2$. This is an upward-opening parabola (since $m>0$). The derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}$ is zero at $x_c$, negative for $0 \\le x < x_c$ and positive for $x > x_c$. This indicates that the critical point $x_c$ is a local minimum.\n\nSince the only critical point in the domain is a minimum, the maximum value of the function $f(x)$ (and thus of the period $T(x)$) on the closed interval $[0, L]$ must occur at one of the boundaries: either at $x=0$ or at $x=L$.\n\nLet's compare the period at these two boundary points.\nCase 1: $x=0$ (bead at the pivot)\nThe system is just the rod.\n$$ T^2(0) = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{g} \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}ML^2}{ML/2} = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{g} \\left(\\frac{2L}{3}\\right) $$\nCase 2: $x=L$ (bead at the far end of the rod)\n$$ T^2(L) = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{g} \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}ML^2 + mL^2}{ML/2 + mL} = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{g} \\frac{L^2(M/3+m)}{L(M/2+m)} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 L}{g} \\frac{M/3+m}{M/2+m} $$\nTo determine which is larger, we compare the terms $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{M/3+m}{M/2+m}$. Let's see if $\\frac{M/3+m}{M/2+m} > \\frac{2}{3}$.\nSince the denominators are positive, we can cross-multiply:\n$$ 3(M/3+m) > 2(M/2+m) $$\n$$ M + 3m > M + 2m $$\n$$ 3m > 2m \\implies m > 0 $$\nSince the bead has a positive mass ($m=M/2 > 0$), this inequality is always true. Therefore, $T^2(L)$ is always greater than $T^2(0)$.\n\nThe function $T(x)$ has a local minimum within the interval $[0, L]$ and its value at the upper boundary $x=L$ is greater than its value at the lower boundary $x=0$. Thus, the global maximum for $x \\in [0, L]$ occurs at $x = L$.\nThe specific mass ratio $m=M/2$ was not needed to determine that the maximum is at the boundary, as the conclusion holds for any $m>0$.\n\nThe position that maximizes the period is $x=L$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{L}$$", "id": "1921143"}]}
