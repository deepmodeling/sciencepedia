The potential energy $U$ of a continuous mass distribution is found by integrating the potential energy of infinitesimal mass elements over the entire volume. The potential energy $dU$ of a small mass element $dm$ at a height $y$ above the reference level (the ground) is given by $dU = g y \\, dm$.\n\nFirst, let's define the geometry of the cone. We place the origin of our coordinate system at the center of the cone's base, with the $y$-axis pointing upwards. The radius of the cone, $r$, is a function of the height $y$. At the base ($y=0$), the radius is $R$. At the apex ($y=H$), the radius is $0$. The relationship is linear, so we can write the radius at height $y$ as $r(y) = R(1 - \\frac{y}{H})$.\n\nNext, we consider an infinitesimal, thin horizontal disk of the trunk at height $y$ with thickness $dy$.\nThe volume of this disk, $dV$, is the area of the circle times its thickness:\n$$dV = \\pi [r(y)]^2 dy = \\pi \\left[R\\left(1 - \\frac{y}{H}\\right)\\right]^2 dy = \\pi R^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{H}\\right)^2 dy$$\n\nThe mass of this infinitesimal disk, $dm$, is its volume multiplied by the uniform density $\\rho$:\n$$dm = \\rho \\, dV = \\rho \\pi R^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{H}\\right)^2 dy$$\n\nThe gravitational potential energy of this disk, $dU$, is its mass times $g$ times its height $y$:\n$$dU = g y \\, dm = g y \\left[ \\rho \\pi R^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{H}\\right)^2 dy \\right]$$\n$$dU = \\pi \\rho g R^2 y \\left(1 - \\frac{2y}{H} + \\frac{y^2}{H^2}\\right) dy$$\n\nTo find the total potential energy $U$ of the entire trunk, we integrate $dU$ from the base ($y=0$) to the apex ($y=H$):\n$$U = \\int dU = \\int_0^H \\pi \\rho g R^2 y \\left(1 - \\frac{2y}{H} + \\frac{y^2}{H^2}\\right) dy$$\n\nWe can take the constants out of the integral:\n$$U = \\pi \\rho g R^2 \\int_0^H \\left(y - \\frac{2y^2}{H} + \\frac{y^3}{H^2}\\right) dy$$\n\nNow, we perform the integration term by term:\n$$U = \\pi \\rho g R^2 \\left[ \\frac{y^2}{2} - \\frac{2y^3}{3H} + \\frac{y^4}{4H^2} \\right]_0^H$$\n\nEvaluating the expression at the limits of integration ($y=H$ and $y=0$):\n$$U = \\pi \\rho g R^2 \\left( \\left(\\frac{H^2}{2} - \\frac{2H^3}{3H} + \\frac{H^4}{4H^2}\\right) - (0) \\right)$$\n$$U = \\pi \\rho g R^2 \\left( \\frac{H^2}{2} - \\frac{2H^2}{3} + \\frac{H^2}{4} \\right)$$\n$$U = \\pi \\rho g R^2 H^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} \\right)$$\n\nWe find a common denominator for the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{6}{12} - \\frac{8}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$$\n\nSo, the symbolic expression for the total potential energy is:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{12} \\pi \\rho g R^2 H^2$$\n\nAlternatively, we can solve this by finding the center of mass of the cone. The total potential energy of the object is $U = M g y_{cm}$, where $M$ is the total mass and $y_{cm}$ is the height of the center of mass.\nThe total mass $M$ is the density $\\rho$ times the volume of the cone $V = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi R^2 H$:\n$$M = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\rho R^2 H$$\nFor a solid cone of uniform density, the center of mass is located at a height of $y_{cm} = \\frac{H}{4}$ from the base.\nTherefore, the total potential energy is:\n$$U = M g y_{cm} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\pi \\rho R^2 H\\right) g \\left(\\frac{H}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{12} \\pi \\rho g R^2 H^2$$\nThis confirms our result from direct integration.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$H = 85.0 \\text{ m}$\n$R = 3.50 \\text{ m}$\n$\\rho = 910 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n$g = 9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2$\n\n$$U = \\frac{1}{12} \\pi (910 \\text{ kg/m}^3) (9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2) (3.50 \\text{ m})^2 (85.0 \\text{ m})^2$$\n$$U = \\frac{1}{12} \\pi (910) (9.81) (12.25) (7225) \\text{ J}$$\n$$U \\approx 207174103.5 \\text{ J}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$U \\approx 2.07 \\times 10^8 \\text{ J}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.07 \\times 10^{8}}$$", "id": "1904345"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice expands our scope to the cosmological scale and introduces the crucial concept of gravitational self-energy.
