By modeling the sequence of decreasing bounce heights as the discrete amplitudes of an effective oscillator, we can directly calculate a key parameter, the logarithmic decrement [@problem_id:1894075]. This exercise demonstrates how the core concepts of damping, specifically the consistent fractional loss of energy per cycle, can be applied to systems beyond the classic spring-mass model.", "problem": "A highly elastic ball is dropped from rest onto a hard, flat horizontal surface. The motion of the ball is characterized by a series of bounces with decreasing peak heights. We can model this system as an effective discrete-time damped oscillator, where the peak height of each bounce represents the amplitude of the oscillation at that \"cycle\". The time between successive bounces is considered one period of this effective oscillator.\n\nSuppose the ball is initially dropped from a height $H_0$. After its $N$-th bounce, it reaches a maximum height of $H_N$. For this particular ball and surface, it is observed that when dropped from an initial height of $H_0 = 2.00 \\text{ m}$, the peak height after the $N=4$-th bounce is $H_4 = 0.500 \\text{ m}$. Assume the coefficient of restitution is constant for all bounces and that air resistance is negligible.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the logarithmic decrement, $\\delta$, for this effective oscillator model. The logarithmic decrement is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of two successive amplitudes (peak heights).\n\nExpress your answer as a single, closed-form analytic expression in terms of mathematical constants only.", "solution": "Let the coefficient of restitution be the constant $c$ for every bounce. For a vertical bounce without air resistance, the speed just before impact and just after are related by $v^{+}=c\\,v^{-}$. The maximum height reached after a bounce is related to the launch speed by energy conservation,\n$$\\tfrac{1}{2} m (v^{+})^{2} = m g H \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad (v^{+})^{2} = 2 g H.$$\nTherefore, if the ball reaches height $H_{n}$ before the $n$-th impact, then just before impact $(v^{-})^{2} = 2 g H_{n}$, and after the bounce $(v^{+})^{2} = c^{2} (v^{-})^{2} = 2 g \\, c^{2} H_{n}$. Hence the next peak height is\n$$H_{n+1} = \\frac{(v^{+})^{2}}{2 g} = c^{2} H_{n}.$$\nThus the heights form a geometric sequence:\n$$H_{N} = c^{2N} H_{0}.$$\nGiven $H_{0}=2.00$ and $H_{4}=0.500$, we have\n$$\\frac{H_{4}}{H_{0}} = c^{8} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad c^{8} = \\frac{0.500}{2.00} = \\frac{1}{4}.$$\nThe logarithmic decrement is defined as the natural logarithm of the ratio of two successive amplitudes:\n$$\\delta = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{H_{n}}{H_{n+1}}\\right).$$\nSince this ratio is constant for all $n$, we can write\n$$\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{H_{0}}{H_{4}}\\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^{3} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{H_{k}}{H_{k+1}}\\right) = 4\\delta.$$\nTherefore,\n$$\\delta = \\frac{1}{4}\\,\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{H_{0}}{H_{4}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\,\\ln 4 = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\ln 2.$$\nThis expression is dimensionless and depends only on mathematical constants, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}\\ln 2}$$", "id": "1894075"}, {"introduction": "We now turn to a precise analysis of a special and highly practical case: critical damping.
