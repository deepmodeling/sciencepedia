Rather than performing a direct integration, we will use a \"completing the symmetry\" strategy to find the electric field from an incomplete charge distribution, turning a difficult calculus problem into an elegant exercise in logic.", "problem": "A thin wire is bent into a shape consisting of three adjacent sides of a square of side length $S$. The wire carries a uniform positive linear charge density $\\lambda$. Consider a Cartesian coordinate system where the geometric center of the full square is at the origin $(0,0)$, and the missing fourth side would lie along the line $y = S/2$ for the interval $x \\in [-S/2, S/2]$.\n\nWithout performing an explicit integration, use symmetry principles to determine the components $(E_x, E_y)$ of the electric field vector at the origin.\n\nFor your reference, the magnitude of the electric field ($E_{\\perp}$) at a point on the perpendicular bisector of a straight rod of length $L$ with uniform charge density $\\lambda$, at a distance $d$ from the rod's center, is given by:\n$$ E_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2\\lambda L}{d \\sqrt{L^2 + 4d^2}} $$\nThe field points perpendicularly away from the rod (for positive $\\lambda$).\n\nExpress the components of the electric field vector $(E_x, E_y)$ in terms of $\\lambda$, $S$, and the permittivity of free space $\\epsilon_0$.", "solution": "Let $\\vec{E}_{\\text{U}}$ be the electric field generated by the U-shaped wire (the three given sides) at the origin. Let $\\vec{E}_{\\text{I}}$ be the electric field that would be generated by the missing fourth side, which we will call segment $I$.\n\nThe core idea is to use the principle of superposition in conjunction with a symmetry argument. Let's consider a complete, closed square loop of wire with the same uniform linear charge density $\\lambda$. Let the electric field at its center be $\\vec{E}_{\\text{loop}}$.\n\nBy symmetry, the electric field at the center of a uniformly charged square loop must be zero. For any infinitesimal charge element $dq$ on the loop, there is an identical charge element located diametrically opposite to it. The electric fields produced by these two elements at the center are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, thus they cancel each other out. Summing over the entire loop, the total field is zero:\n$$ \\vec{E}_{\\text{loop}} = \\vec{0} $$\nThe closed loop can be viewed as the combination of the U-shaped wire and the missing segment $I$. By the principle of superposition, the field of the loop is the vector sum of the fields from its constituent parts:\n$$ \\vec{E}_{\\text{loop}} = \\vec{E}_{\\text{U}} + \\vec{E}_{\\text{I}} $$\nSince $\\vec{E}_{\\text{loop}} = \\vec{0}$, we have:\n$$ \\vec{0} = \\vec{E}_{\\text{U}} + \\vec{E}_{\\text{I}} $$\nThis leads to the key relationship:\n$$ \\vec{E}_{\\text{U}} = - \\vec{E}_{\\text{I}} $$\nThis means that the electric field from the three-sided wire is simply the negative of the electric field from the single missing segment. Our problem is now reduced to calculating $\\vec{E}_{\\text{I}}$.\n\nThe missing segment $I$ is a straight rod of length $S$. According to the problem's coordinate system, it lies along the line $y=S/2$ from $x=-S/2$ to $x=S/2$. The point of interest is the origin $(0,0)$. This point lies on the perpendicular bisector of the segment $I$. The perpendicular distance from the center of the segment (at $(0, S/2)$) to the origin is $S/2$.\n\nWe can use the provided formula for the electric field of a rod, $E_{\\perp}$. We substitute the parameters for our segment $I$:\nLength of the rod, $L = S$.\nPerpendicular distance to the point, $d = S/2$.\n\nPlugging these into the given formula:\n$$ E_I = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{2\\lambda S}{(S/2) \\sqrt{S^2 + 4(S/2)^2}} $$\nNow, we simplify the expression:\n$$ E_I = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{4\\lambda S}{S \\sqrt{S^2 + 4(S^2/4)}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{4\\lambda}{\\sqrt{S^2 + S^2}} $$\n$$ E_I = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{4\\lambda}{\\sqrt{2S^2}} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{4\\lambda}{S\\sqrt{2}} $$\nRationalizing the denominator and simplifying the numerical factors:\n$$ E_I = \\frac{4\\lambda}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 S\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi\\epsilon_0 S\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 S} $$\nThis is the magnitude of the field $\\vec{E}_{\\text{I}}$. Now we determine its direction. The segment $I$ is on the positive $y$-axis relative to the origin, and the charge density $\\lambda$ is positive. Therefore, the electric field it produces at the origin points away from the charge, i.e., in the negative $y$-direction.\nSo, the vector $\\vec{E}_{\\text{I}}$ is:\n$$ \\vec{E}_{\\text{I}} = 0 \\hat{i} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 S} \\hat{j} $$\nFinally, we find the field of the U-shaped wire, $\\vec{E}_{\\text{U}}$:\n$$ \\vec{E}_{\\text{U}} = - \\vec{E}_{\\text{I}} = - \\left( 0 \\hat{i} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 S} \\hat{j} \\right) = 0 \\hat{i} + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 S} \\hat{j} $$\nThe components of the electric field vector at the origin are therefore:\n$$ E_x = 0 $$\n$$ E_y = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 S} $$\nThis result for $E_x=0$ is also expected from direct symmetry of the U-shaped wire itself, which is symmetric with respect to the $y$-axis. The contributions to the $x$-component of the electric field from the two vertical sides cancel each other out, and the bottom horizontal side produces no $x$-component of the field at the origin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\lambda}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 S} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1936289"}, {"introduction": "Symmetry in physics is not just about geometric shapes; it also applies to the very laws of nature.

This exercise [@problem_id:1936290] explores how this conservation law acts as a powerful \"selection rule\" in the quantum realm, dictating which processes are allowed and which are \"forbidden.\" You will see why an atom in an excited state with angular momentum quantum number $J=2$ cannot decay to a ground state of $J=0$ by emitting a single photon, a direct and observable consequence of a fundamental symmetry principle.", "problem": "In atomic spectroscopy, certain transitions between energy levels are observed to be \"forbidden,\" meaning they occur with extremely low or zero probability. Consider an isolated atom in an excited state characterized by a total angular momentum quantum number $J_i = 2$. It is observed experimentally that this atom never decays directly to its ground state, which has a total angular momentum quantum number $J_f = 0$, by emitting a single photon. From quantum theory, it is known that a photon carries an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) corresponding to a quantum number $s_\\gamma = 1$.\n\nAssuming that total angular momentum is conserved in all physical processes, which of the following statements provides the correct physical reason for why the transition from the $J_i=2$ state to the $J_f=0$ state via single-photon emission is forbidden?\n\nA. Conservation of linear momentum requires the atom to remain at rest after emission, which is impossible if a photon with non-zero momentum is created.\n\nB. The conservation of angular momentum is a scalar law, requiring the initial quantum number to equal the sum of the final quantum numbers ($J_i = J_f + s_\\gamma$). Since $2 \\neq 0 + 1$, the transition is forbidden.\n\nC. Angular momentum is a vector quantity. The rules for vector addition dictate the possible magnitudes of the total final angular momentum. The combination of the final atom's angular momentum ($J_f=0$) and the photon's angular momentum ($s_\\gamma=1$) cannot result in a total angular momentum with a magnitude corresponding to $J_i=2$.\n\nD.
