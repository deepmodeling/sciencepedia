This practice solidifies your understanding of the core relationship between the energy of the incoming photon ($E_{\\gamma}$), the energy required to remove an electron from its orbital (the ionization energy $I_e$), and the resulting kinetic energy ($K$) of the free electron. By working through a hypothetical two-stage experiment, you will use the fundamental equation $K = E_{\\gamma} - I_e$ to solve for an unknown ionization energy, a skill essential for interpreting any photoelectron spectrum [@problem_id:2010418].", "problem": "An experimental physics team is studying the electronic properties of a newly synthesized noble gas, which they have named \"Arganon\" (Ag). To measure its ionization energy, they employ the technique of Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES). The experiment is conducted in two stages using a gaseous sample of Arganon.\n\nIn the first stage, the gas is irradiated by a monochromatic ultraviolet light source with an unknown photon energy, $E_1$. The photoelectrons ejected from Arganon's outermost valence shell are detected and found to have a kinetic energy of $K_0$.\n\nIn the second stage, the apparatus is modified with a different light source. This new source provides photons with an energy, $E_2$, that is precisely three times the ionization energy, $I_e$, of the Arganon valence electron. When the gas is irradiated with this new source, the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons ejected from the same valence shell is measured to be exactly five times the kinetic energy observed in the first stage.\n\nBased on these experimental findings, determine the ionization energy, $I_e$, of the Arganon valence electron. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $K_0$.", "solution": "The physical principle governing this problem is the photoelectric effect, as applied in Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES). The energy of an incoming photon is used to overcome the binding energy of an electron and provide it with kinetic energy. The relationship is given by the equation:\n$$K = E_{\\gamma} - I_e$$\nwhere $K$ is the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectron, $E_{\\gamma}$ is the energy of the incident photon, and $I_e$ is the ionization energy of the electron (also known as the binding energy). We will apply this equation to the two stages of the experiment.\n\nFor the first stage of the experiment, the photon energy is $E_1$, the measured kinetic energy is $K_0$, and the ionization energy of the Arganon valence electron is $I_e$. The governing equation is:\n$$K_0 = E_1 - I_e \\quad (1)$$\n\nFor the second stage of the experiment, the photon energy is $E_2$ and the measured kinetic energy is $K_2$. The governing equation is:\n$$K_2 = E_2 - I_e \\quad (2)$$\n\nThe problem provides two key relationships between the variables in these two stages:\nFirst, the photon energy in the second stage is three times the ionization energy:\n$$E_2 = 3 I_e \\quad (3)$$\nSecond, the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons in the second stage is five times the kinetic energy from the first stage:\n$$K_2 = 5 K_0 \\quad (4)$$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find $I_e$ in terms of $K_0$. Let's substitute the relations from equations (3) and (4) into equation (2):\n$$5 K_0 = (3 I_e) - I_e$$\n\nNow, we can simplify the right side of this equation:\n$$5 K_0 = 2 I_e$$\n\nFinally, we can solve for the ionization energy, $I_e$, by dividing both sides by 2:\n$$I_e = \\frac{5}{2} K_0$$\n\nThe unknown photon energy from the first experiment, $E_1$, is not required to find the solution, as it is implicitly handled within the system of equations. The final result expresses the ionization energy solely in terms of the initial kinetic energy measurement, $K_0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{2} K_{0}}$$", "id": "2010418"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply measuring ionization energies, one of the most powerful applications of photoelectron spectroscopy is determining the chemical state of an atom. This is achieved by observing the \"chemical shift,\" a small change in an electron's binding energy due to its local molecular environment. This exercise challenges you to predict the ordering of carbon 1s binding energies in a series of fluorinated molecules, applying your knowledge of chemical principles like electronegativity and the inductive effect to interpret spectral data [@problem_id:2010452]. Mastering this concept allows us to use XPS as a tool for chemical analysis, identifying not just which elements are present, but also how they are bonded.", "problem": "X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a powerful surface-sensitive technique used to determine the elemental composition and chemical state of a material. In an XPS experiment, a sample is irradiated with X-rays, causing the emission of core-level electrons. The kinetic energy of these photoejected electrons is measured, and from this, their binding energy can be calculated. The binding energy of a core electron is sensitive to the local chemical environment of the atom.\n\nConsider the following series of simple fluorinated hydrocarbon molecules: ethane, fluoroethane, and 1,1-difluoroethane.

For a core level such as C 1s, the dominant trends in chemical shifts are governed by the initial-state effective nuclear charge at the carbon nucleus, $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, which increases when valence electron density at that carbon is withdrawn by electronegative substituents. Qualitatively, reduced electronic screening raises $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and thus increases $E_{\\text{B}}$. Fluorine, being highly electronegative, withdraws electron density via the inductive effect. The magnitude of this effect is largest for a carbon directly bonded to F (alpha position), decays with distance (beta position smaller), and is approximately additive with the number of F atoms attached to the adjacent or the same carbon.\n\nApplying these principles to the labeled carbons:\n- $C_{A}$ (ethane, $CH_{3}\\!-\\!CH_{3}$) has no electron-withdrawing substituents; it provides the lowest baseline $E_{\\text{B}}$.\n- In fluoroethane, $C_{B}$ is the methyl carbon beta to a single F. The beta inductive effect slightly raises $E_{\\text{B}}$ over $C_{A}$, so $C_{B}C_{A}$.\n- In fluoroethane, $C_{C}$ is alpha to one F. The strong alpha inductive effect substantially raises $E_{\\text{B}}$, so $C_{C}$ is higher than both $C_{A}$ and $C_{B}$.\n- In 1,1-difluoroethane, $C_{D}$ is beta to two F. Two beta effects are roughly additive and larger than a single beta effect, so $C_{D}C_{B}$, but they remain weaker than a single alpha effect, hence $C_{D}C_{C}$.\n- In 1,1-difluoroethane, $C_{E}$ is alpha to two F. Two alpha inductive effects give the largest withdrawal and the highest $E_{\\text{B}}$, so $C_{E}$ is the highest.\n\nCombining these inequalities yields the overall order from lowest to highest binding energy:\n$$\nC_{A}  C_{B}  C_{D}  C_{C}  C_{E},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2010452"}, {"introduction": "A photoelectron spectrum often reveals more than just a single peak; it can display a rich vibrational fine structure that encodes information about molecular geometry.
