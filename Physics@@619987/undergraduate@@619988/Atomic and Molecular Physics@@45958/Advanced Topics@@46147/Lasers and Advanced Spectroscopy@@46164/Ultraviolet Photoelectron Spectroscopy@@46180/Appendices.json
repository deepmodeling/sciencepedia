In this technique, a sample is irradiated with monochromatic ultraviolet radiation, and the kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is measured. The energy of an incoming photon ($h\\nu$) is partitioned between the energy required to remove an electron from a specific orbital, known as its binding energy ($BE$), and the kinetic energy ($KE$) of the emitted photoelectron.\n\nThe chemist has two photon sources available: a Helium-I (He I) source, which provides photons with an energy of $21.22$ eV, and a Helium-II (He II) source, which provides photons with an energy of $40.81$ eV. Theoretical calculations predict that a key molecular orbital in the molecule has a binding energy of $BE = 27.55$ eV.\n\nTo observe a signal from this orbital, the incident photon energy must exceed the binding energy.

This practice [@problem_id:2045549] delves into the Franck-Condon principle to explain why ionizing an electron from a bonding orbital versus a non-bonding one results in dramatically different spectral features. Understanding this connection allows chemists to use UPS not just to measure energy levels, but to \"see\" the consequence of removing an electron on the molecule's geometry.", "problem": "An Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) experiment is performed on a polyatomic molecule. The experiment involves irradiating the molecule with high-energy photons and measuring the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons. Each peak, or band, in the resulting spectrum corresponds to the ionization of an electron from a specific molecular orbital.\n\nConsider two distinct ionization events from this molecule:\n\n1.  **Process 1:** An electron is removed from a non-bonding molecular orbital. Theoretical calculations show that this ionization causes a very minor change in the equilibrium bond lengths and angles of the resulting molecular ion compared to the neutral molecule.\n2.  **Process 2:** An electron is removed from a strongly bonding molecular orbital. This ionization significantly weakens the chemical bonds, resulting in a large increase in the equilibrium bond lengths of the molecular ion compared to the neutral molecule.\n\nBased on the principles governing electronic transitions in molecules, what characteristic feature would be expected for the spectral band associated with Process 2?\n\nA. The band will consist of a single, extremely sharp line with no additional structure.\n\nB. The band will be very broad and exhibit an extended vibrational fine structure, with the most intense peak likely not being the one corresponding to the lowest vibrational energy transition.\n\nC. The band will be completely absent from the spectrum because the transition is forbidden by selection rules.\n\nD. The band will show a 'spin-orbit splitting' pattern, breaking into two or more distinct, sharp peaks of similar intensity.\n\nE. The band's overall intensity will be significantly lower than any other band in the spectrum, regardless of its shape.", "solution": "Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measures the kinetic energy distribution of electrons ejected upon ionization, producing bands that correspond to transitions from the neutral molecule to vibrational levels of the molecular ion associated with a given electronic configuration. Under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, electronic transitions are much faster than nuclear motion, so the Franck-Condon principle applies: transitions are vertical in nuclear coordinate space, and the intensity distribution within a band is governed by Franck-Condon factors, i.e., overlaps between vibrational wavefunctions of the initial and final electronic states.\n\nFor a given normal mode coordinate $Q$, if the neutral and ionic potential energy surfaces are approximated as harmonic wells with equilibrium positions displaced by $\\Delta Q$, then the transition probability from the initial vibrational state $v''$ to the final state $v'$ is\n$$\nI_{v',v''} \\propto \\left|\\left\\langle \\chi_{v'}^{+}(Q) \\mid \\chi_{v''}(Q) \\right\\rangle\\right|^{2}.\n$$\nWhen the initial state is the ground vibrational level, $v''=0$, and the vibrational frequencies are similar, the resulting progression along that mode is characterized by the Huang-Rhys factor $S$, which depends on the displacement $\\Delta Q$ (e.g., for equal curvatures, $S$ is proportional to $\\Delta Q^{2}$). In this limit, the distribution of intensities along the progression is approximately\n$$\nI_{v',0} \\propto \\exp(-S)\\,\\frac{S^{v'}}{v'!},\n$$\nwith the most intense line occurring near $v' \\approx S$. Thus:\n- If the geometry change upon ionization is very small (small $\\Delta Q$, small $S$), the overlap is dominated by the $v'=0$ transition, yielding a narrow band with little or no vibrational structure.\n- If the geometry change is large (large $\\Delta Q$, large $S$), the Franck-Condon envelope is broad, many vibrational quanta are excited, and the most intense peak is shifted to higher $v'$ rather than the $0\\text{â€“}0$ line.\n\nIn Process 2, removing an electron from a strongly bonding orbital weakens bonds and increases equilibrium bond lengths substantially. This corresponds to a large displacement $\\Delta Q$ along bond-stretching normal modes in the ionic state, hence a large $S$. Therefore the associated UPS band will be broad with an extended vibrational progression, and the intensity maximum will likely not be at the lowest vibrational transition. This matches the description in option B and contradicts the other options:\n- A is characteristic of small geometry change (Process 1), not Process 2.\n- C is incorrect because ionization continua follow Franck-Condon factors; the transition is not symmetry-forbidden in the UPS sense.\n- D describes fine splittings due to spin-orbit coupling, which is not the primary effect here and does not capture the broad vibrational envelope caused by large geometry change.\n- E makes an absolute claim about overall intensity that is not dictated by the geometry change alone.\n\nHence the correct feature is a broad band with extended vibrational structure and a non-origin maximum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2045549"}, {"introduction": "A more advanced application of UPS involves analyzing the directions in which photoelectrons are ejected after ionization.
