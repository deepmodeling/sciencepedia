Consider a simplified EELS experiment where a beam of electrons, each with an initial kinetic energy of $K_i = 40.0$ eV, is fired into a chamber containing stationary helium gas. The first ionization energy of a helium atom is $I_{He} = 24.6$ eV. A single collision event is observed in which an incident electron ionizes a helium atom. The original incident electron is then scattered and subsequently detected with a final kinetic energy of $K_f = 10.0$ eV. Assuming the recoil kinetic energy of the resulting helium ion is negligible, determine the kinetic energy of the electron that was ejected from the helium atom.\n\nExpress your answer in electron-volts (eV), rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem describes an inelastic collision between an energetic electron and a stationary helium atom, resulting in the ionization of the atom. To solve for the kinetic energy of the ejected electron, we apply the principle of conservation of energy to the system.\n\nThe total energy of the system before the collision must equal the total energy of the system after the collision.\n\nBefore the collision, the total energy, $E_{initial}$, consists of the kinetic energy of the incident electron, $K_i$, and the rest energy of the neutral helium atom, $E_{He}$. Since the helium atom is stationary, its initial kinetic energy is zero.\n$$E_{initial} = K_i + E_{He}$$\n\nAfter the collision, the helium atom is ionized, meaning it has lost one electron and become a helium ion, He$^{+}$. The total energy after the collision, $E_{final}$, is the sum of:\n1. The kinetic energy of the scattered incident electron, $K_f$.\n2. The kinetic energy of the newly ejected electron from the atom, which we will call $K_{ejected}$.\n3. The rest energy of the resulting helium ion, $E_{He^{+}}$.\nThe problem statement specifies that the recoil kinetic energy of the helium ion is negligible, so we do not need to include it in our energy balance.\n\nThe relationship between the rest energy of the neutral atom ($E_{He}$) and the ion ($E_{He^{+}}$) is defined by the ionization energy, $I_{He}$. The ionization energy is the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the atom. Thus, the energy of the ion plus a free electron at rest is higher than the energy of the neutral atom by $I_{He}$.\n$$E_{He^{+}} = E_{He} + I_{He}$$\nSo, the total energy after the collision is:\n$$E_{final} = K_f + K_{ejected} + E_{He^{+}} = K_f + K_{ejected} + (E_{He} + I_{He})$$\n\nBy the conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n$$K_i + E_{He} = K_f + K_{ejected} + E_{He} + I_{He}$$\nThe rest energy of the helium nucleus and the remaining bound electron, $E_{He}$, appears on both sides of the equation and can be canceled out. This leaves us with an equation relating the kinetic energies and the ionization energy:\n$$K_i = K_f + K_{ejected} + I_{He}$$\nWe are asked to find the kinetic energy of the ejected electron, $K_{ejected}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n$$K_{ejected} = K_i - K_f - I_{He}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$K_i = 40.0$ eV\n$K_f = 10.0$ eV\n$I_{He} = 24.6$ eV\n\n$$K_{ejected} = 40.0 \\text{ eV} - 10.0 \\text{ eV} - 24.6 \\text{ eV}$$\n$$K_{ejected} = 30.0 \\text{ eV} - 24.6 \\text{ eV}$$\n$$K_{ejected} = 5.4 \\text{ eV}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.
