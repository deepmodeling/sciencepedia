The active medium consists of a crystal doped with ions, which operate as a four-level system. The relevant energy levels for a single ion are denoted $E_0, E_1, E_2, E_3$ in order of increasing energy, with corresponding populations $N_0, N_1, N_2, N_3$. The total number of active ions in the crystal is a constant, $N_{total}$.\n\nThe system dynamics are as follows:\n- An external pump source excites ions from the ground state ($E_0$) to the pump band ($E_3$) at a rate $W_p$ per ion in the ground state.\n- The upper lasing level is $E_2$, and the lower lasing level is $E_1$.

This process is so fast that we can assume any ion pumped to $E_3$ instantaneously appears in $E_2$. Thus, the effective pumping rate into level $E_2$ is $W_p N_0$.\n- The total lifetime of an ion in the upper lasing level $E_2$ due to all spontaneous decay processes is $\\tau_2$.\n- Stimulated emission on the $E_2 \\to E_1$ transition is characterized by a rate coefficient $W_{stim}$.
