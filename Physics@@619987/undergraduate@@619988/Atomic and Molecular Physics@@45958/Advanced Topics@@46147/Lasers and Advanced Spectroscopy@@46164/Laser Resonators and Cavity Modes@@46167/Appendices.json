Let the length of the cavity be $L$. For a wave traveling from one mirror to the other and back, the total distance traveled is $2L$. The wavelength of light inside the medium, $\\lambda_n$, is related to its wavelength in vacuum, $\\lambda_0$, by $\\lambda_n = \\lambda_0 / n$, where $n$ is the refractive index of the medium.\n\nAlternatively, and more directly, we can state that the cavity length $L$ must be an integer multiple of half-wavelengths of the light within the medium. This ensures that a node exists at each mirror. The condition is:\n$$L = m \\frac{\\lambda_n}{2}$$\nwhere $m$ is a large integer representing the mode number.\n\nThe frequency of the light, $\\nu$, is related to its speed and wavelength inside the medium.

For practical lasers with curved mirrors, stability is paramount. This practice [@problem_id:2002163] introduces the powerful g-parameter stability criterion, a simple yet profound tool used by physicists to design stable optical cavities. By analyzing how stability depends on mirror curvature and separation, you gain insight into the geometric constraints that govern whether a laser can function at all.", "problem": "An optical physicist is designing a laser resonator cavity. The cavity is formed by two concave mirrors, M1 and M2, aligned on a common optical axis. The radius of curvature of a concave mirror is defined as a positive quantity. Mirror M1 has a radius of curvature $R_1 = R_0$, and mirror M2 has a radius of curvature $R_2 = 2R_0$, where $R_0$ is a positive constant length. The distance $L$ between the two mirrors can be adjusted.\n\nThe stability of the optical resonator is determined by the cavity's g-parameters, which are given by $g_1 = 1 - L/R_1$ and $g_2 = 1 - L/R_2$.
