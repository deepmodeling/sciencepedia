This first practice [@problem_id:2048569] builds your qualitative understanding of this principle by exploring how an atom's bonding partners influence its core-level binding energies through electronegativity.", "problem": "X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is a surface-sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique that measures the elemental composition, empirical formula, chemical state and electronic state of the elements within a material. The technique works by irradiating a material with a beam of X-rays while simultaneously measuring the kinetic energy of electrons that are ejected from the top 1-10 nm of the material being analyzed. The binding energy of an ejected core-level electron is a key quantity measured in XPS.\n\nConsider the acetic acid molecule, which has the chemical structure $CH_3COOH$. This molecule contains two carbon atoms in chemically distinct environments: one in the methyl group ($-CH_3$) and another in the carboxyl group ($-COOH$). Let's denote the carbon atom in the methyl group as $C_M$ and the carbon atom in the carboxyl group as $C_C$. In the C 1s XPS spectrum of acetic acid, two separate peaks are observed, one for each non-equivalent carbon atom. This phenomenon is known as a chemical shift.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the carbon atom with the higher 1s binding energy and provides the correct physical justification for this difference?\n\nA. The methyl carbon, $C_M$, has a higher binding energy because it is bonded to three hydrogen atoms, which are less electronegative than carbon, leading to a greater accumulation of electron density and thus a stronger attraction for the core electrons.\n\nB. The carboxyl carbon, $C_C$, has a higher binding energy because it is bonded to two highly electronegative oxygen atoms, which withdraw valence electron density from the carbon, reducing the shielding of the nucleus and increasing the effective nuclear charge experienced by the 1s electrons.\n\nC. The methyl carbon, $C_M$, has a higher binding energy because the C-H bonds are stronger than the C-O bonds, meaning more energy is required to remove an electron from the carbon atom.\n\nD. Both carbon atoms, $C_M$, and $C_C$, have the same 1s binding energy because the binding energy is an intrinsic property of the element, and is therefore identical for all carbon atoms regardless of their chemical environment.\n\nE. The carboxyl carbon, $C_C$, has a higher binding energy because the delocalized $\\pi$ system of the carboxyl group increases the local electron density, shielding the core electrons more effectively.", "solution": "Define the core-level binding energy measured in XPS as the difference between the incident photon energy and the measured electron kinetic energy, corrected for the spectrometer work function:\n$$\nE_{\\text{B}}=h\\nu - E_{\\text{kin}} - \\phi.\n$$\nFor a given photon energy and instrument, variations in $E_{\\text{B}}$ across chemically distinct atoms arise from differences in the local electronic environment. The central physical principle is that the 1s binding energy increases with the effective nuclear charge experienced by the core electrons:\n$$\nZ_{\\text{eff}}=Z-\\sigma,\n$$\nwhere $Z$ is the atomic number and $\\sigma$ is the screening (shielding) constant due to surrounding electrons. A decrease in $\\sigma$ (less valence electron density around the atom) increases $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ and therefore increases $E_{\\text{B}}$ for core levels. Conversely, an increase in local valence electron density increases $\\sigma$, reduces $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, and lowers $E_{\\text{B}}$.\n\nApply this to the two carbons in acetic acid, $C_{M}$ in $-CH_{3}$ and $C_{C}$ in $-COOH$:\n- $C_{C}$ is bonded to two oxygen atoms, which are highly electronegative. Through inductive withdrawal (and resonance in the carbonyl), they reduce the valence electron density at $C_{C}$. This reduction in local electron density decreases $\\sigma$, increases $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, and thus increases the 1s binding energy $E_{\\text{B}}$ at $C_{C}$.\n- $C_{M}$ is bonded to three hydrogen atoms, which are less electronegative than carbon and donate electron density toward carbon via inductive effects and hyperconjugation. This increases local electron density, increases $\\sigma$, reduces $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, and thus lowers the 1s binding energy $E_{\\text{B}}$ at $C_{M}$.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect: more electron density at $C_{M}$ would increase shielding and lower, not raise, the 1s binding energy.\n- B is correct: electronegative oxygens withdraw electron density from $C_{C}$, reduce shielding, increase $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, and raise the 1s binding energy.\n- C is incorrect: core-level binding energies do not correlate directly with bond strength; they depend primarily on electronic screening and $Z_{\\text{eff}}$.\n- D is incorrect: chemical shifts in XPS demonstrate that core-level binding energies depend on chemical environment.\n- E is incorrect: invoking increased local electron density would increase shielding and lower the binding energy; the actual effect at $C_{C}$ is electron withdrawal and a higher binding energy.\n\nTherefore, the carboxyl carbon $C_{C}$ has the higher C 1s binding energy, for the reason stated in B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2048569"}, {"introduction": "Moving from the qualitative to the quantitative, this practice demonstrates how to calculate the chemical shift from experimental data.
