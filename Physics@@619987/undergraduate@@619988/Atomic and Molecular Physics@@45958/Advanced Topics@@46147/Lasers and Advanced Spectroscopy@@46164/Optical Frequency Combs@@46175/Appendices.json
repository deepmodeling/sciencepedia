The governing equation is provided in the problem statement:\n$$f_n = n f_{rep} + f_{ceo}$$\n\nFirst, we identify the given parameters:\n- Mode number: $n = 250,000$ (a dimensionless integer)\n- Repetition rate: $f_{rep} = 1 \\text{ GHz}$\n- Carrier-envelope offset frequency: $f_{ceo} = 100 \\text{ MHz}$\n\nTo perform the calculation, we must first express all frequencies in a consistent base unit, which is Hertz (Hz). We use the standard conversions $1 \\text{ GHz} = 10^9 \\text{ Hz}$ and $1 \\text{ MHz} = 10^6 \\text{ Hz}$.\n\nConverting the given frequencies to Hertz:\n$$f_{rep} = 1 \\text{ GHz} = 1 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz}$$\n$$f_{ceo} = 100 \\text{ MHz} = 100 \\times 10^6 \\text{ Hz} = 1 \\times 10^8 \\text{ Hz}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the frequency comb equation:\n$$f_n = (250,000) \\times (1 \\times 10^9 \\text{ Hz}) + (1 \\times 10^8 \\text{ Hz})$$\n\nLet's calculate the first term, which is the product of the mode number and the repetition rate.

Let's express $f_{ceo}$ in terms of $10^{14}$ Hz.\n$$1 \\times 10^8 \\text{ Hz} = 0.000001 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ Hz}$$\nSo, the sum becomes:\n$$f_n = (2.5 + 0.000001) \\times 10^{14} \\text{ Hz} = 2.500001 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ Hz}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be in terahertz (THz).
