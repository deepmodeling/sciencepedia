The number of absorption bands observed in an infrared or Raman spectrum is related to the number of ways a molecule can vibrate, known as its fundamental vibrational modes.\n\nConsider a newly synthesized molecule, Zirconium tetrafluoride ($\\text{ZrF}_4$), which is being studied for its potential use in manufacturing high-refractive-index optical fibers. Theoretical calculations and experimental data suggest that in the gaseous phase, the molecule adopts a non-linear, square planar geometry. In this configuration, the Zirconium ($Zr$) atom is at the center of a square, and the four Fluorine ($F$) atoms are located at the four corners. All five atoms lie within the same plane.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of fundamental vibrational modes for a single molecule of gaseous Zirconium tetrafluoride.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of fundamental vibrational modes of a single molecule of Zirconium tetrafluoride ($\\text{ZrF}_4$), which is described as having a square planar geometry.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the total number of atoms, $N$, in the molecule. The chemical formula is $\\text{ZrF}_4$, which contains one Zirconium atom and four Fluorine atoms. Thus, the total number of atoms is $N = 1 + 4 = 5$.\n\nThe total number of degrees of freedom for a molecule with $N$ atoms is $3N$. These degrees of freedom describe the molecule's overall translational motion, rotational motion, and internal vibrational motion.\nTotal degrees of freedom = $3N$.\n\nFor any molecule, there are 3 degrees of freedom corresponding to the translational motion of its center of mass along the x, y, and z axes.\n\nThe number of rotational degrees of freedom depends on the molecule's geometry.\n- For a linear molecule, there are 2 rotational degrees of freedom (rotation about the two axes perpendicular to the molecular axis).\n- For a non-linear molecule, there are 3 rotational degrees of freedom (rotation about the x, y, and z axes).\n\nThe remaining degrees of freedom correspond to the internal vibrations of the molecule. The number of fundamental vibrational modes is therefore:\n- For a linear molecule: $3N - 5$ (since 3 are translational and 2 are rotational).\n- For a non-linear molecule: $3N - 6$ (since 3 are translational and 3 are rotational).\n\nThe problem states that the $\\text{ZrF}_4$ molecule has a square planar geometry. A square planar shape is not a straight line, so the molecule is non-linear. Therefore, we must use the formula for a non-linear molecule.\n\nNumber of vibrational modes = $3N - 6$.\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $N=5$ into this formula:\nNumber of vibrational modes = $3(5) - 6$\nNumber of vibrational modes = $15 - 6$\nNumber of vibrational modes = $9$\n\nSo, a gaseous Zirconium tetrafluoride molecule with a square planar structure has 9 fundamental vibrational modes.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "1979023"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply counting vibrational modes, group theory allows us to classify them by symmetry and predict how they behave under chemical changes.
