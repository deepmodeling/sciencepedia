This exercise asks you to derive the maximum possible scattering force, which occurs in the limit of high laser intensity, providing a crucial benchmark for the effectiveness of laser cooling techniques [@problem_id:2003190].", "problem": "The technique of laser cooling, fundamental to creating ultracold atomic gases, relies on the mechanical force exerted by light on atoms. This radiation pressure force arises from the transfer of momentum from photons to an atom during repeated cycles of absorption and spontaneous emission.\n\nConsider a single stationary atom, which for this problem can be modeled as a simple two-level system, interacting with a very intense, monochromatic laser beam. The laser is tuned perfectly to the resonance frequency of the atom's principal electronic transition. This transition is characterized by a wavelength $\\lambda$ and a natural linewidth $\\Gamma$. The natural linewidth $\\Gamma$ is defined as the full width at half maximum of the transition's spectral profile in units of radians per second. In the limit of very high laser intensity, the atom is said to be \"saturated,\" and it scatters photons at the maximum possible rate.\n\nDetermine the expression for the magnitude of the maximum radiation pressure force, $F_{max}$, that can be exerted on the atom under these saturated, on-resonance conditions.
