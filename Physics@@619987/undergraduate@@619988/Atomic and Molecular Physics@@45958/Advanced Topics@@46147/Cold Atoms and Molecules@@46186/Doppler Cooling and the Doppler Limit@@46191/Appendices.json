By using two counter-propagating laser beams, physicists create an \"optical molasses\" that slows atoms down regardless of their direction of travel.

To slow it down, the atom is placed in a one-dimensional optical molasses setup. This consists of two identical, counter-propagating laser beams directed along the x-axis. Both lasers are tuned to the same angular frequency $\\omega_L$.\n\nInitially, the atom is moving along the positive x-axis with a non-relativistic velocity $v$. The lasers are red-detuned, meaning their frequency $\\omega_L$ is slightly lower than the atomic resonance, i.e., the detuning $\\delta = \\omega_L - \\omega_0$ is a small negative value. This configuration produces a net force on the atom that opposes its motion, a process known as Doppler cooling.\n\nImagine that at a specific moment, the frequency of both lasers is instantaneously changed to a new value, $\\omega'_L$, such that the new detuning, $\\delta' = \\omega'_L - \\omega_0$, is positive and has the same magnitude as the initial detuning (i.e., $\\delta' = -\\delta > 0$).
