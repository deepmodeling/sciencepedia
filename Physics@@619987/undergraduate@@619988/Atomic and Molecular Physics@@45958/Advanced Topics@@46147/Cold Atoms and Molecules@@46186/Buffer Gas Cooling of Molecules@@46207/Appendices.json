The answer lies not in their mass, but in their molecular structure and its resulting interaction with the helium atoms. This exercise challenges you to identify the key physical principle that explains this dramatic difference in cooling efficiency, highlighting the critical role that a permanent electric dipole moment plays in rotational energy transfer [@problem_id:1984150].", "problem": "An experimental physics student is tasked with cooling two different diatomic molecular gases, carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen ($\\text{N}_2$), to near absolute zero using the technique of buffer gas cooling. In this method, the \"hot\" molecules are injected into a cryogenic cell filled with a cold, inert buffer gas, in this case, helium (He) atoms held at a temperature of 4 K. The student observes the rate at which the rotational temperature of the molecular ensembles equilibrates with the cold helium gas. Both CO and $\\text{N}_2$ molecules are in their ground electronic state ($\\text{X}^1\\Sigma^+$ and $\\text{X}^1\\Sigma_g^+$ respectively). The student finds that the rotational degrees of freedom of the CO molecules cool rapidly, reaching thermal equilibrium with the helium bath in a short time. In stark contrast, the rotational degrees of freedom of the $\\text{N}_2$ molecules cool extremely slowly, with an efficiency several orders of magnitude lower than that of CO.\n\nAssuming all other experimental conditions (buffer gas density, initial molecular energies, cell geometry) are identical for both experiments, what is the fundamental physical principle that accounts for this dramatic difference in rotational cooling efficiency?\n\nA. The mass of a $\\text{N}_2$ molecule is significantly different from that of a CO molecule, altering the collision kinematics with the helium atoms.\n\nB. The bond length of $\\text{N}_2$ is shorter than that of CO, leading to a larger rotational constant and wider spacing of rotational energy levels, which are harder to de-excite.\n\nC. $\\text{N}_2$ is a homonuclear molecule lacking a permanent electric dipole moment, whereas CO is a heteronuclear molecule that possesses one.\n\nD. $\\text{N}_2$, having identical nuclei (bosons with spin 1), must obey nuclear spin statistics, leading to the existence of ortho and para states which complicates the cooling process.\n\nE. The vibrational frequency of the N-N bond is much higher than that of the C-O bond, which suppresses collisional energy transfer.", "solution": "We compare the rotational cooling rates for two diatomic molecules, CO and $\\text{N}_{2}$, in identical buffer-gas conditions (same helium density, temperature, and geometry). The characteristic cooling rate for rotational degrees of freedom in a buffer gas is controlled by the rotational inelastic collision rate:\n$$\nR \\sim n_{\\text{He}} \\langle \\sigma_{\\text{inel}} v \\Delta E \\rangle,\n$$\nwhere $n_{\\text{He}}$ is the helium number density, $v$ is the relative speed, $\\Delta E$ is the rotational energy change per inelastic collision, and $\\sigma_{\\text{inel}}$ is the rotationally inelastic cross section. Given that $n_{\\text{He}}$ and the temperature are the same in both experiments, the dramatic difference in cooling efficiency must arise from differences in $\\sigma_{\\text{inel}}$.\n\nIn atomâ€“molecule collisions at low temperature, rotational transitions are driven by the anisotropic part of the interaction potential $V_{\\text{anis}}(R,\\theta)$ between the molecule and the atom. The inelastic cross section scales with the square of the coupling matrix element:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{inel}} \\propto \\left| \\langle J' M' | V_{\\text{anis}}(R,\\theta) | J M \\rangle \\right|^{2},\n$$\nso stronger anisotropy yields larger $\\sigma_{\\text{inel}}$ and thus faster cooling.\n\nFor a polar molecule with permanent dipole moment $\\mu$ interacting with a spherically symmetric atom of polarizability $\\alpha$, the leading long-range induction interaction includes an anisotropic component that scales as\n$$\nV_{\\text{ind}}(R,\\theta) \\sim -\\frac{\\alpha \\mu^{2}}{R^{6}} f(\\cos\\theta),\n$$\nwhere $f(\\cos\\theta)$ encodes angular dependence (e.g., terms proportional to Legendre polynomials such as $P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)$). This yields a relatively large $V_{\\text{anis}}$ and hence large $\\sigma_{\\text{inel}}$.\n\nFor a nonpolar molecule with $\\mu=0$, the leading anisotropy arises only from much weaker higher-order terms (e.g., quadrupole-induced interactions or dispersion anisotropy), so\n$$\n|V_{\\text{anis}}|_{\\mu=0} \\ll |V_{\\text{anis}}|_{\\mu\\neq 0} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad \\sigma_{\\text{inel}}^{(\\mu=0)} \\ll \\sigma_{\\text{inel}}^{(\\mu\\neq 0)}.\n$$\nTherefore, polar molecules exhibit much more efficient rotational cooling in helium buffer gas than nonpolar molecules.\n\nApplying this to the given molecules: CO is heteronuclear and possesses a permanent dipole moment, $\\mu_{\\text{CO}} \\neq 0$, whereas $\\text{N}_{2}$ is homonuclear and has no permanent dipole moment, $\\mu_{N_{2}}=0$. Hence CO has a strong anisotropic induction interaction with He that greatly enhances rotationally inelastic cross sections, while $\\text{N}_{2}$ lacks this enhancement, leading to orders-of-magnitude slower rotational relaxation.\n\nWe can now rule out the other options based on first principles:\n- A is incorrect because the masses of CO and $\\text{N}_{2}$ are essentially the same, so collision kinematics do not differ enough to account for orders-of-magnitude differences in rotational cooling.\n- B is insufficient: while the rotational constant $B$ affects level spacings $E_{J}=B J(J+1)$, $B$ for CO and $\\text{N}_{2}$ are of the same order, and in any case the dominant factor for cooling efficiency is the inelastic coupling, not the modest difference in level spacings.\n- D is not the primary effect: nuclear spin statistics may restrict $J$ parity manifolds in homonuclear molecules but do not suppress the magnitude of the atomâ€“molecule anisotropic coupling that determines $\\sigma_{\\text{inel}}$ by orders of magnitude.\n- E is irrelevant at these temperatures for rotational cooling: vibrational levels are not thermally accessed at $T$ near a few kelvin, and rotational relaxation is not limited by vibrational frequency differences.\n\nThus, the fundamental physical principle explaining the observed difference is the presence (for CO) or absence (for $\\text{N}_{2}$) of a permanent electric dipole moment, which controls the strength of the anisotropic interaction and thereby the rotationally inelastic cross sections.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1984150"}]}
