The defining principle for the classical radius is that the electrostatic potential energy of a charged particle, modeled as a shell of charge, is equal to its rest mass-energy.\n\nFirst, let's write down the expressions for the two energies. The rest mass-energy of a particle with mass $m$ is given by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence principle:\n$$E = mc^2$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nThe electrostatic potential energy $U$ of a spherical shell of charge $q$ and radius $r$ is given by:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{q^2}{r}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. Let's denote the electrostatic constant $k_e = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}$.
