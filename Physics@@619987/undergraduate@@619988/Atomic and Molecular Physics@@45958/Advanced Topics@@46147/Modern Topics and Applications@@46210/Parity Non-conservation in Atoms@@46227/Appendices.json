The interaction of the atom's electric dipole moment with this field is described by a perturbation Hamiltonian known as the Stark Hamiltonian, given by $H_{\\text{Stark}} = - \\hat{\\vec{d}} \\cdot \\vec{E}$. The electric dipole operator is defined as $\\hat{\\vec{d}} = q\\hat{\\vec{r}}$, where $q$ is the charge of the relevant particle (e.g., $-e$ for an electron) and $\\hat{\\vec{r}}$ is its position operator.\n\nThe parity operator, $\\hat{P}$, is a quantum mechanical operator that inverts spatial coordinates.

The Stark Hamiltonian conserves parity, and therefore it cannot cause mixing between any atomic states.\n\nC. The Stark Hamiltonian does not conserve parity, and as a result, it causes mixing primarily between atomic states of the same parity.\n\nD. The Stark Hamiltonian conserves parity, but it can still cause mixing between atomic states of opposite parity.\n\nE. The Stark Hamiltonian does not mix states; it only causes a shift in the energy levels of individual states that are not degenerate.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine whether the Stark Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{Stark}}$, conserves parity and what the consequences are for the mixing of atomic states.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the parity properties of the Stark Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{Stark}} = - \\hat{\\vec{d}} \\cdot \\vec{E}$.\nThe parity operator $\\hat{P}$ is unitary, meaning $\\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = \\hat{P}^{-1}$, and also Hermitian, meaning $\\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = \\hat{P}$. This implies $\\hat{P}^2 = \\hat{I}$, where $\\hat{I}$ is the identity operator. We are given the transformation rule for the position operator: $\\hat{P} \\hat{\\vec{r}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = -\\hat{\\vec{r}}$.\n\nLet's find the transformation property of the electric dipole operator, $\\hat{\\vec{d}} = q\\hat{\\vec{r}}$.\n$$ \\hat{P} \\hat{\\vec{d}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = \\hat{P} (q\\hat{\\vec{r}}) \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = q (\\hat{P} \\hat{\\vec{r}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger}) $$\nSubstituting the given transformation for $\\hat{\\vec{r}}$, we get:\n$$ \\hat{P} \\hat{\\vec{d}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = q(-\\hat{\\vec{r}}) = -q\\hat{\\vec{r}} = -\\hat{\\vec{d}} $$\nThis shows that the electric dipole operator $\\hat{\\vec{d}}$ is an operator of odd parity.\n\nNow, we can analyze the Stark Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{Stark}} = - \\hat{\\vec{d}} \\cdot \\vec{E}$. The external electric field $\\vec{E}$ is a classical vector field, not a quantum operator in this context, so the parity operator does not act on it.\n$$ \\hat{P} H_{\\text{Stark}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = \\hat{P} (- \\hat{\\vec{d}} \\cdot \\vec{E}) \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = - (\\hat{P} \\hat{\\vec{d}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger}) \\cdot \\vec{E} $$\nSubstituting our result for the transformation of $\\hat{\\vec{d}}$:\n$$ \\hat{P} H_{\\text{Stark}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = - (-\\hat{\\vec{d}}) \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\hat{\\vec{d}} \\cdot \\vec{E} = -H_{\\text{Stark}} $$\nA Hamiltonian $H$ conserves parity if $\\hat{P} H \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = H$. Here we have found that $\\hat{P} H_{\\text{Stark}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} = -H_{\\text{Stark}}$. Since $H_{\\text{Stark}}$ is generally not the zero operator, this means $\\hat{P} H_{\\text{Stark}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger} \\neq H_{\\text{Stark}}$. Therefore, the Stark Hamiltonian does not conserve parity. This eliminates options B and D.\n\nNext, we must determine the consequences of this non-conservation for state mixing. According to perturbation theory, the Stark Hamiltonian can cause mixing between two unperturbed energy eigenstates, say $|\\psi_n\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_m\\rangle$, if the matrix element $\\langle \\psi_m | H_{\\text{Stark}} | \\psi_n \\rangle$ is non-zero.\n\nThe unperturbed atomic eigenstates are also eigenstates of the parity operator $\\hat{P}$. Let $|\\psi_n\\rangle$ have parity $P_n$ and $|\\psi_m\\rangle$ have parity $P_m$. This means $\\hat{P}|\\psi_n\\rangle = P_n|\\psi_n\\rangle$ and $\\hat{P}|\\psi_m\\rangle = P_m|\\psi_m\\rangle$, where $P_n$ and $P_m$ are either +1 (even parity) or -1 (odd parity).\n\nLet's evaluate the matrix element:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_m | H_{\\text{Stark}} | \\psi_n \\rangle $$\nWe can insert the identity operator $\\hat{I} = \\hat{P}^{\\dagger}\\hat{P}$ twice:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_m | H_{\\text{Stark}} | \\psi_n \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_m | \\hat{P}^{\\dagger}\\hat{P} H_{\\text{Stark}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger}\\hat{P} | \\psi_n \\rangle $$\nGrouping the terms differently:\n$$ = \\langle \\hat{P}\\psi_m | (\\hat{P} H_{\\text{Stark}} \\hat{P}^{\\dagger}) | \\hat{P}\\psi_n \\rangle $$\nNow we use the fact that $|\\psi_m\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_n\\rangle$ are parity eigenstates, and we use our result for the transformation of $H_{\\text{Stark}}$:\n$$ = \\langle P_m \\psi_m | (-H_{\\text{Stark}}) | P_n \\psi_n \\rangle $$\nSince $P_m$ and $P_n$ are scalars, we can pull them out. Note that the bra vector $\\langle P_m \\psi_m |$ is equivalent to $P_m^* \\langle \\psi_m |$. Since parity eigenvalues are real ($P_m^*=P_m$), this becomes $P_m \\langle \\psi_m |$.\n$$ = - P_m P_n \\langle \\psi_m | H_{\\text{Stark}} | \\psi_n \\rangle $$\nSo we have the relation:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_m | H_{\\text{Stark}} | \\psi_n \\rangle = - P_m P_n \\langle \\psi_m | H_{\\text{Stark}} | \\psi_n \\rangle $$\nFor the matrix element $\\langle \\psi_m | H_{\\text{Stark}} | \\psi_n \\rangle$ to be non-zero, the equation must be consistent. This requires:\n$$ 1 = - P_m P_n $$\nor\n$$ P_m P_n = -1 $$\nThis condition can only be satisfied if one of the parity eigenvalues is +1 and the other is -1. In other words, the Stark Hamiltonian only connects (mixes) states of opposite parity. For example, it can mix an s-state ($l=0$, parity $(-1)^0=+1$) with a p-state ($l=1$, parity $(-1)^1=-1$), but it cannot mix an s-state with another s-state or with a d-state ($l=2$, parity $(-1)^2=+1$).\n\nTherefore, the Stark Hamiltonian does not conserve parity, and it causes mixing between atomic states of opposite parity. This corresponds to option A.\nOption C is incorrect because it states mixing occurs between states of the same parity.\nOption E is incorrect because while energy shifts do occur, state mixing is a fundamental aspect of the Stark effect, especially for degenerate states (linear Stark effect) and in second-order perturbation for non-degenerate states.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2009295"}, {"introduction": "Having established the mechanism of state mixing, we now turn to the actual Parity Non-Conservation (PNC) effect caused by the weak neutral current.
