The interaction strength between the field and the system is characterized by a constant Rabi frequency, $\\Omega$.

For this to be successful, the evolution must be \"gentle\" enough. A common criterion for this process requires that at the point of resonance, where the field's frequency matches the system's resonance frequency, the square of the Rabi frequency must be at least a dimensionless factor $C$ times the magnitude of the rate of change of the angular frequency detuning.
