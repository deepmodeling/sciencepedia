This involves finding the reducible representation for the vibrations, $\\Gamma_{vib}$, and then decomposing it into the irreducible representations of the $C_{3v}$ point group.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the reducible representation for all degrees of freedom ($\\Gamma_{3N}$).**\nThe ammonia molecule has $N=4$ atoms. The total number of degrees of freedom is $3N = 3(4) = 12$. We can generate a reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, for these 12 degrees of freedom by considering how many atoms remain in their original position (are \"unshifted\") under each symmetry operation of the group. The character for each operation in $\\Gamma_{3N}$ is the product of the number of unshifted atoms and the character of the operation for a 3D vector.\n\nThe $C_{3v}$ point group has three classes of symmetry operations: $E$ (identity), $C_3$ (rotation by 120 degrees), and $\\sigma_v$ (vertical reflection plane).\n- For the identity operation, $E$, all 4 atoms are unshifted. The character for $E$ in 3D space is 3.\n  $\\chi_{3N}(E) = (\\text{number of unshifted atoms}) \\times (\\text{character for E}) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n- For a $C_3$ rotation, the axis of rotation passes through the nitrogen atom. Thus, only the N atom is unshifted (the three H atoms are moved). The character for a $C_n$ rotation is $1 + 2\\cos(2\\pi/n)$. For $C_3$, this is $1 + 2\\cos(120^\\circ) = 1 + 2(-\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$.\n  $\\chi_{3N}(C_3) = 1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n- For a $\\sigma_v$ reflection, the plane contains the N atom and one of the H atoms. Thus, 2 atoms are unshifted. The character for a reflection is 1.\n  $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_v) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nSo, the characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ are:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\nC_{3v} & E & 2C_3 & 3\\sigma_v \\\\\n\\hline\n\\Gamma_{3N} & 12 & 0 & 2\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the reducible representation for vibrations ($\\Gamma_{vib}$).**\nThe total degrees of freedom, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, are composed of translational, rotational, and vibrational modes: $\\Gamma_{3N} = \\Gamma_{trans} + \\Gamma_{rot} + \\Gamma_{vib}$.\nWe can find the representations for translation and rotation directly from the character table.\n- $\\Gamma_{trans}$ transforms as the Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$. From the table, $z$ transforms as $A_1$ and the pair $(x, y)$ transforms as $E$. Thus, $\\Gamma_{trans} = A_1 + E$.\n- $\\Gamma_{rot}$ transforms as the rotations $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$. From the table, $R_z$ transforms as $A_2$ and the pair $(R_x, R_y)$ transforms as $E$. Thus, $\\Gamma_{rot} = A_2 + E$.\n\nNow we can find $\\Gamma_{vib}$ by subtraction: $\\Gamma_{vib} = \\Gamma_{3N} - \\Gamma_{trans} - \\Gamma_{rot}$. We perform this by subtracting the characters of the corresponding representations.\n$$\n\\chi_{vib}(R) = \\chi_{3N}(R) - \\chi_{A_1}(R) - \\chi_{A_2}(R) - 2\\chi_{E}(R)\n$$\n- $\\chi_{vib}(E) = 12 - 1 - 1 - 2(2) = 12 - 6 = 6$.\n- $\\chi_{vib}(C_3) = 0 - 1 - 1 - 2(-1) = 0 - 2 + 2 = 0$.\n- $\\chi_{vib}(\\sigma_v) = 2 - 1 - (-1) - 2(0) = 2 - 1 + 1 - 0 = 2$.\n\nThe characters for the vibrational modes are:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\nC_{3v} & E & 2C_3 & 3\\sigma_v \\\\\n\\hline\n\\Gamma_{vib} & 6 & 0 & 2\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe dimension of this representation is $\\chi_{vib}(E) = 6$, which matches the expected number of vibrational modes for a non-linear molecule, $3N-6 = 3(4)-6=6$.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose $\\Gamma_{vib}$ into its irreducible representations.**\nWe use the reduction formula to find how many times each irreducible representation ($A_1, A_2, E$) appears in $\\Gamma_{vib}$. The formula is:\n$$\nn_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_R N_R \\chi_i(R) \\chi_{vib}(R)\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group ($h=1+2+3=6$), $N_R$ is the number of operations in class $R$, $\\chi_i(R)$ is the character of the irreducible representation $i$ for operation $R$, and $\\chi_{vib}(R)$ is the character of our reducible representation for vibrations.\n\n- For $A_1$: $n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ (1)(1)(6) + (2)(1)(0) + (3)(1)(2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{6}(6 + 0 + 6) = \\frac{12}{6} = 2$.\n- For $A_2$: $n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ (1)(1)(6) + (2)(1)(0) + (3)(-1)(2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{6}(6 + 0 - 6) = 0$.\n- For $E$: $n_{E} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left[ (1)(2)(6) + (2)(-1)(0) + (3)(0)(2) \\right] = \\frac{1}{6}(12 + 0 + 0) = \\frac{12}{6} = 2$.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the vibrational modes is $\\Gamma_{vib} = 2A_1 + 2E$. This represents two non-degenerate vibrations of $A_1$ symmetry and two doubly-degenerate vibrations of $E$ symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the polarized Raman bands.**\nA fundamental rule of Raman spectroscopy states that a vibrational mode will produce a **polarized** band if and only if the mode belongs to the **totally symmetric irreducible representation** of the molecule's point group. For the $C_{3v}$ group, the totally symmetric representation is the one for which all characters are +1, which is $A_1$.\n\nFrom our decomposition, we found that there are two vibrational modes with $A_1$ symmetry ($\\Gamma_{vib} = 2A_1 + 2E$). Therefore, these two modes will give rise to polarized bands in the Raman spectrum. The two modes with $E$ symmetry will be Raman active (as they transform as quadratic functions $(x^2-y^2, xy), (xz, yz)$) but will be depolarized.\n\nThe number of fundamental vibrations that produce polarized Raman bands is the number of modes with $A_1$ symmetry.

The intensity of Raman scattered light is proportional to the square of the induced dipole moment, which is given by $\\vec{p} = \\hat{\\alpha} \\vec{E}$, where $\\vec{E}$ is the electric field of the incident light and $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is the Raman polarizability tensor for the specific vibration.\n\nFor an isotropic sample (like a liquid or gas with randomly oriented molecules), the scattered intensities can be expressed in terms of the invariants of the Raman polarizability tensor: the mean polarizability $\\bar{\\alpha}'$ and the anisotropy $\\gamma'$.\nThe mean polarizability is given by $\\bar{\\alpha}' = \\frac{1}{3}(\\alpha'_{xx} + \\alpha'_{yy} + \\alpha'_{zz})$, and the anisotropy is given by $(\\gamma')^2 = \\frac{1}{2}[(\\alpha'_{xx}-\\alpha'_{yy})^2 + (\\alpha'_{yy}-\\alpha'_{zz})^2 + (\\alpha'_{zz}-\\alpha'_{xx})^2 + 6(\\alpha'_{xy})^2 + 6(\\alpha'_{yz})^2 + 6(\\alpha'_{zx})^2]$.\n\nFor scattering at $90^\\circ$ with linearly polarized incident light, the parallel and perpendicular scattered intensities are given by:\n$$I_\\parallel \\propto 45(\\bar{\\alpha}')^2 + 4(\\gamma')^2$$\n$$I_\\perp \\propto 3(\\gamma')^2$$\n\nThe depolarization ratio $\\rho_l$ is therefore:\n$$\\rho_l = \\frac{I_\\perp}{I_\\parallel} = \\frac{3(\\gamma')^2}{45(\\bar{\\alpha}')^2 + 4(\\gamma')^2}$$\n\nThis classical model, known as Placzek's polarizability theory, makes a key assumption: the Raman polarizability tensor $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is symmetric (i.e., $\\alpha'_{ij} = \\alpha'_{ji}$). This assumption holds true when the excitation laser frequency is far from any electronic absorption frequencies of the molecule.\n\nBased on this formula, we can analyze two cases for molecular vibrations:\n1.  **Totally symmetric vibrations:** For these vibrations, the symmetry of the molecule is preserved. It can be shown from group theory that $\\bar{\\alpha}' \\neq 0$. Therefore, the depolarization ratio is $0 \\le \\rho_l < 3/4$. Such bands are called \"polarized\". The lower limit $\\rho_l = 0$ corresponds to a perfectly isotropic vibration where $\\gamma' = 0$.\n2.  **Non-totally symmetric (asymmetric) vibrations:** For these vibrations, group theory predicts that the mean polarizability change is zero, $\\bar{\\alpha}' = 0$. The formula for the depolarization ratio simplifies to:\n    $$\\rho_l = \\frac{3(\\gamma')^2}{0 + 4(\\gamma')^2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\n    Such bands are called \"depolarized\".\n\nFrom this analysis, the classical theory predicts that the depolarization ratio for linearly polarized light can never exceed $3/4$. The observation of $\\rho_l = 0.85$ indicates that the assumptions of the classical Placzek theory are not valid in this experiment.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\n**A. The excitation laser frequency is close to the frequency of an electronic absorption band of the molecule (Resonance Raman condition).**\nThis is the condition for Resonance Raman scattering. When the excitation frequency approaches an electronic transition, the scattering intensity is greatly enhanced. Crucially, under these resonance conditions, the Raman polarizability tensor $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is no longer required to be symmetric ($\\alpha'_{ij} \\neq \\alpha'_{ji}$). The breakdown of this symmetry invalidates the Placzek theory and the intensity expressions derived from it. The more general theory for resonance conditions allows for what is termed \"anomalous polarization,\" where the depolarization ratio $\\rho_l$ can be greater than $3/4$. This is the standard explanation for observed values of $\\rho_l > 0.75$. This option is a very strong candidate.\n\n**B. The vibrational mode being observed is perfectly isotropic, meaning its polarizability change is the same in all directions.**\nA perfectly isotropic vibration means its anisotropy $\\gamma'$ is zero. According to the formula, if $\\gamma'=0$, then $I_\\perp = 0$ and $\\rho_l = 0$. This would lead to a perfectly polarized band, the exact opposite of the anomalous result observed. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n**C. The sample is not a liquid but a single crystal, perfectly aligned such that one of its principal axes is parallel to the laser polarization.**\nUsing a single crystal breaks the assumption of random molecular orientation. In this case, the depolarization ratio depends critically on the crystal's orientation relative to the laser polarization and collection optics. While one can get various values for $\\rho_l$, there is no general reason for it to exceed $3/4$ due to alignment alone. In fact, alignment often leads to more \"ordered\" scattering and can result in very small, specific depolarization ratios. It doesn't explain the violation of the fundamental limit derived from the tensor properties. So, this option is unlikely to be the primary cause.\n\n**D. The incident laser light used in the experiment was actually circularly polarized, not linearly polarized as assumed.**\nIf the incident light were circularly polarized, one would measure the circular depolarization ratio, $\\rho_c$. The theoretical limit for this ratio is $\\rho_c \\le 6/7 \\approx 0.857$. A measured value of $0.85$ would be perfectly plausible and not anomalous for circularly polarized light. However, the problem defines the measurement in terms of $\\rho_l$ ($I_\\parallel$ and $I_\\perp$ with respect to a linear polarization vector). This option suggests an experimental error in identifying the light source, but the physical phenomenon producing the scattering is still the same. The question asks for a physical explanation for the observed ratio, and the most direct physical cause for such a value is resonance. The question is posed in the framework of a linear polarization experiment, and within that framework, a physical cause for the value itself is sought.\n\n**E. The scattered light is so intense that it is saturating the detector, leading to a non-linear intensity reading.**\nDetector saturation is an experimental artifact. While it could distort the measured ratio, it's not a fundamental physical phenomenon related to the scattering process itself. For example, if $I_\\parallel$ (which is usually stronger for polarized bands) saturates more than $I_\\perp$, it could artificially increase the measured ratio. However, \"anomalous polarization\" is a well-known physical effect with a specific cause. The Resonance Raman effect provides a direct and fundamental physical explanation, whereas detector saturation is a measurement error that might coincidentally produce a similar number. Therefore, the Resonance Raman effect is the *most likely physical explanation*.\n\nConclusion: The most direct and fundamental physical explanation for a depolarization ratio $\\rho_l > 3/4$ is the breakdown of the symmetric polarizability tensor assumption, which occurs under Resonance Raman conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1987358"}]}
