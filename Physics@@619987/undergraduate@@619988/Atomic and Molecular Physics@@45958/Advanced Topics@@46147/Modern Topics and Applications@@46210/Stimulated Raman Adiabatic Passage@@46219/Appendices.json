The goal is to transfer the entire atomic population from state $|1\\rangle$ to state $|3\\rangle$ efficiently.\n\nTo achieve this, a technique known as Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) is employed. This method uses two coherent laser pulses: a \"pump\" pulse with a time-dependent Rabi frequency $\\Omega_P(t)$ that couples states $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$, and a \"Stokes\" pulse with Rabi frequency $\\Omega_S(t)$ that couples states $|2\\rangle$ and $|3\\rangle$.
