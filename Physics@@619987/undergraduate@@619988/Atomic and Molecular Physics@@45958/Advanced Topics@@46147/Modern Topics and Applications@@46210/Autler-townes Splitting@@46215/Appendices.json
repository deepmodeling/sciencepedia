The experiment focuses on observing the Autler-Townes effect. The magnitude of the frequency splitting of the spectral lines, denoted as $\\Delta_{AT}$, is known to be directly proportional to the Rabi frequency, $\\Omega$, of the strong coupling laser field driving one of the atomic transitions. The Rabi frequency itself is directly proportional to the amplitude of the laser's electric field, $E$. For a laser beam of a fixed cross-sectional area, its power, $P$, is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude.\n\nIn the first run of the experiment, the physicist adjusts the coupling laser to have a power of $P_1$. For the second run, they increase the power of the same coupling laser to $P_2 = 4 P_1$, while keeping all other conditions (like laser beam size and atomic vapor properties) unchanged. Determine the factor by which the magnitude of the Autler-Townes splitting, $\\Delta_{AT}$, changes from the first run to the second run.

This pair of peaks is the Autler-Townes doublet.\n\nThe frequency separation of these two peaks is equal to the Rabi frequency $\\Omega$. However, decoherence processes (e.g., spontaneous emission) cause each peak to have a finite spectral width. We can model each peak as a Lorentzian lineshape with the same Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), denoted by $\\gamma$.\n\nThe two peaks are considered \"resolved\" if there is a distinct dip in absorption between them.
