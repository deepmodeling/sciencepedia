This means that the stationary energy eigenstates of this system, in general, are not eigenstates of the parity operator. Therefore, the energy eigenstates do not have definite parity (they are neither purely even nor purely odd). The only exception would be the trivial, non-physical solution $\\psi(x) = 0$.\n\nThus, none of the non-trivial energy eigenstates have definite parity.
