This shape is mathematically captured by the Fano parameter, $q$, which encodes the relative strength and phase of the interfering pathways. By analyzing the special case of $q=0$ [@problem_id:1991785], you will develop a deep physical intuition for how destructive interference can create a \"window resonance,\" where the absorption cross-section dramatically drops to zero.", "problem": "An atomic physicist is studying the photoionization of a neutral atom. The absorption spectrum is measured as a function of the incident photon energy, $E$. In the energy range of interest, the atom can be ionized by a direct transition to a continuum of states. However, within this same energy range, a discrete, doubly-excited electronic state also exists. This discrete state is coupled to the continuum, allowing for a process called autoionization, where the atom is first excited to the discrete state, which then decays by ejecting an electron.\n\nThe quantum interference between the direct photoionization pathway and the indirect autoionization pathway gives rise to an asymmetric resonance shape in the photoionization cross-section, $\\sigma(E)$. This shape is described by the Fano profile:\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\sigma_{bg} \\frac{(q + \\epsilon)^2}{1 + \\epsilon^2}\n$$\nHere, $\\sigma_{bg}$ is the background cross-section corresponding to the direct ionization process, $\\epsilon = (E - E_r)/(\\Gamma/2)$ is the reduced energy relative to the resonance energy $E_r$, $\\Gamma$ is the width of the resonance, and $q$ is a dimensionless shape parameter known as the Fano parameter.\n\nUpon analyzing a particular resonance, the physicist's data conclusively shows that the Fano parameter for this transition is $q=0$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical interpretation of this observation ($q=0$) and the resulting absorption spectrum?\n\nA. The absorption cross-section becomes a symmetric Lorentzian peak centered at $E=E_r$. This occurs because the direct transition to the continuum is forbidden, and only the transition to the discrete state is allowed.\n\nB. The direct transition via photon absorption from the ground state to the discrete autoionizing state is forbidden. At the resonance energy $E_r$, perfect destructive interference occurs, causing the absorption cross-section to drop to zero and creating a \"window resonance\".\n\nC. The transition amplitudes for the direct path to the continuum and the indirect path via the discrete state are exactly equal and in phase. This leads to perfect constructive interference, causing an infinitely sharp absorption peak at $E=E_r$.\n\nD. The resonance has an infinitely wide energy profile ($\\Gamma \\to \\infty$). The atom is ionized instantaneously, and the concept of a discrete state loses its meaning, resulting in a flat, featureless absorption spectrum.\n\nE. The Fano parameter being zero indicates that the system cannot be described by quantum mechanics. The observed cross-section would hence be a random, noisy signal with no discernible features.", "solution": "The starting point is the Fano profile for the photoionization cross-section,\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\sigma_{bg} \\frac{(q+\\epsilon)^{2}}{1+\\epsilon^{2}},\n$$\nwith $\\epsilon = \\frac{E - E_{r}}{\\Gamma/2}$. The parameter $q$ encodes the relative transition amplitude (including phase) for excitation of the discrete (autoionizing) component versus the direct excitation of the continuum. In Fano’s formalism, $q$ is proportional to the ratio of two dipole transition amplitudes, schematically $q \\propto \\frac{\\langle \\text{discrete} | \\hat{D} | g \\rangle}{\\langle \\text{continuum} | \\hat{D} | g \\rangle}$ (up to an energy-dependent phase arising from the continuum coupling). Thus, $q=0$ implies that the direct dipole transition amplitude from the ground state to the discrete autoionizing state vanishes, while the direct continuum matrix element is nonzero.\n\nSet $q=0$ in the Fano formula:\n$$\n\\sigma(E) = \\sigma_{bg} \\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{1+\\epsilon^{2}}.\n$$\nEvaluate at resonance, $\\epsilon = 0$:\n$$\n\\sigma(E_{r}) = \\sigma_{bg} \\frac{0^{2}}{1+0^{2}} = 0.\n$$\nThus at $E=E_{r}$ the cross-section vanishes due to perfect destructive interference between the modified continuum amplitude (affected by coupling to the discrete state) and the background continuum amplitude. For $|\\epsilon| \\to \\infty$,\n$$\n\\lim_{|\\epsilon|\\to\\infty} \\sigma(E) = \\sigma_{bg} \\lim_{|\\epsilon|\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{1+\\epsilon^{2}} = \\sigma_{bg},\n$$\nso the line shape is a dip (a “window resonance”) within the continuum background, not a peak.\n\nThis behavior corresponds precisely to the physical picture that when $q=0$, the discrete state is not directly excited by the photon (its dipole matrix element from the ground state is zero), but its coupling to the continuum still alters the phase of the continuum channel. The two pathways then interfere destructively exactly at $E=E_{r}$, driving the cross-section to zero. This matches the statement that the direct transition to the discrete state is forbidden and a window resonance appears at $E_{r}$.\n\nBy contrast:\n- A describes a symmetric Lorentzian peak, which corresponds to $|q| \\to \\infty$ (dominant discrete excitation) rather than $q=0$.\n- C is incorrect because the width remains $\\Gamma$; there is no infinitely sharp peak and $q=0$ gives a dip, not constructive interference.\n- D incorrectly ties $q=0$ to $\\Gamma \\to \\infty$; $\\Gamma$ is independent of $q$.\n- E is incorrect; $q=0$ is a well-defined quantum-mechanical regime yielding a characteristic window resonance.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate interpretation is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1991785"}, {"introduction": "The finite lifetime of an autoionizing state is intrinsically linked to the width of its resonance peak, a relationship elegantly described by the time-energy uncertainty principle.
