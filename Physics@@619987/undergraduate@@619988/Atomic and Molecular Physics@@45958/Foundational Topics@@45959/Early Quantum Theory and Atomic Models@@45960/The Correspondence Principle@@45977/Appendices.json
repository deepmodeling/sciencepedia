This system can be modeled as a particle in an infinite potential well, where the potential energy is zero for $0 < x < L$ and infinite elsewhere. The energy levels of the electron are quantized and described by a principal quantum number $n$, where $n$ is a positive integer ($n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$). As $n$ becomes very large, the system is expected to behave more classically, meaning the discrete nature of the energy levels becomes less apparent.\n\nYour task is to quantify this transition. Determine the smallest integer quantum number $n$ for which the relative difference between the energy of the state $n+1$ and the energy of the state $n$ is less than $0.1\\%$.

The energy of the $n$-th state, $E_n$, is given by:\n$$\nE_n = \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant and $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$ is the principal quantum number.\n\nThe energy of the next higher state, $E_{n+1}$, is found by replacing $n$ with $n+1$:\n$$\nE_{n+1} = \\frac{(n+1)^2 h^2}{8mL^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy difference, $\\Delta E$, between these adjacent levels:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{n+1} - E_n = \\frac{(n+1)^2 h^2}{8mL^2} - \\frac{n^2 h^2}{8mL^2}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{h^2}{8mL^2}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = \\frac{h^2}{8mL^2} \\left( (n+1)^2 - n^2 \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the $(n+1)^2$ term gives $n^2 + 2n + 1$.

Therefore, the inequality $0.001 n^2 - 2n - 1 > 0$ is satisfied for values of $n$ greater than the larger root.\nSo, we need $n > 2000.499875$.\n\nThe problem asks for the smallest *integer* quantum number $n$ that satisfies this condition.
