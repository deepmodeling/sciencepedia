This process populates various energy levels of the hydrogen atoms. We are interested in the subsequent de-excitation process. Consider a collection of hydrogen atoms where every atom is initially in the excited state corresponding to the principal quantum number $n=4$. As these atoms relax, they emit photons and transition to lower energy levels, eventually returning to the ground state ($n=1$).
