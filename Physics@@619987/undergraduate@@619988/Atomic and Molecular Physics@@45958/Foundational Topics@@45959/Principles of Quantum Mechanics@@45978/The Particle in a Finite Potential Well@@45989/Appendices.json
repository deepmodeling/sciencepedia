All input parameters ($m, V_0, a$) and physical constants ($\\hbar, q_e, m_e$) must be converted to a consistent system of units, the International System of Units (SI), before calculation. The potential depth $V_0$, given in electronvolts (eV), is converted to joules (J) using the elementary charge $q_e$.\n\n2.  **Root-Finding Strategy**: The solutions for $x$ are the roots of the functions $f_e(x) = x \\tan(x) - \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - x^2}$ and $f_o(x) = -x \\cot(x) - \\sqrt{\\zeta^2 - x^2}$. A graphical analysis shows that the solutions are ordered and lie in distinct intervals. The $n$-th energy state (with $n=1$ being the ground state) has a corresponding dimensionless wavenumber $x_n$ that lies in the interval $((n-1)\\pi/2, n\\pi/2)$.\n    - States with odd index $n = 1, 3, 5, \\dots$ are of even parity and are solutions to $f_e(x) = 0$.\n    - States with even index $n = 2, 4, 6, \\dots$ are of odd parity and are solutions to $f_o(x) = 0$.\n\n    We can systematically find all roots by iterating through the state index $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ and searching for a root within the appropriate interval, as long as the start of the interval $(n-1)\\pi/2$ is less than $\\zeta$. The search for a root $x$ is confined to the range $[(n-1)\\pi/2, \\min(n\\pi/2, \\zeta)]$.\n\n3.  **Numerical Method**: A robust numerical root-finding algorithm is required. The Brent-Dekker method (available in SciPy as `brentq`) is an excellent choice. It is a hybrid bracketing method that guarantees convergence if the function values at the endpoints of the search interval have opposite signs.\n    - For even parity states, the function $f_e(x)$ changes sign from negative to positive over the interval $(m\\pi, m\\pi+\\pi/2)$, where $m = (n-1)/2$.\n    - For odd parity states, the function $f_o(x)$ changes sign from negative to positive over the interval $(m\\pi+\\pi/2, (m+1)\\pi)$, where $m=(n-2)/2$.\n    This sign-change property ensures the reliability of the `brentq` method. To avoid singularities of $\\tan(x)$ and $\\cot(x)$ at the interval boundaries, the search bracket is slightly contracted, for example, by a small amount $\\epsilon$.\n\n4.  **Energy Calculation and Finalization**: For each root $x_n$ found, the corresponding energy $E_n$ is calculated in joules using the formula derived earlier. This energy is then converted to electronvolts by dividing by $q_e$. The resulting energies for each test case are sorted in ascending order (which is naturally produced by finding roots $x_n$ for increasing $n$) and rounded to $6$ decimal places as required.
