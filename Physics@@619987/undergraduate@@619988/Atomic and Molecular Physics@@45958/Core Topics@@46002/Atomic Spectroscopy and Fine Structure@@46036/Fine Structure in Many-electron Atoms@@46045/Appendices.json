Due to the spin-orbit interaction, this term splits into a multiplet of distinct, closely-spaced energy levels, an effect known as fine structure. Each of these fine-structure levels is characterized by a specific total angular momentum quantum number, $J$.\n\nCalculate the total number of unique quantum states (i.e., the total degeneracy) encompassed by the $^4D$ term when all of its fine-structure levels are taken into account.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total degeneracy of the $^4D$ term, which is the sum of the degeneracies of all its constituent fine-structure levels.\n\nFirst, we need to extract the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$, and the total spin angular momentum quantum number, $S$, from the given term symbol $^4D$. A term symbol is generally written as $^{2S+1}L$.\n\nThe letter in the term symbol represents the value of $L$. The convention is as follows: $S$ for $L=0$, $P$ for $L=1$, $D$ for $L=2$, $F$ for $L=3$, and so on alphabetically. For the term $^4D$, the letter is $D$, which corresponds to a total orbital angular momentum quantum number of $L=2$.\n\nThe superscript in the term symbol represents the spin multiplicity, which is equal to $2S+1$.
