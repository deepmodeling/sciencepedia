The technique is based on the Auger effect, a physical phenomenon where an atom with an electron vacancy in a core shell rearranges to a lower energy state. This rearrangement involves an outer-shell electron filling the core vacancy, with the transition energy being transferred to another outer-shell electron, which is then ejected from the atom. This ejected electron is called an Auger electron.\n\nThe process is often described using a three-letter notation, such as KLL, which signifies the shells involved. A KLL Auger process proceeds as follows:\n1.  A vacancy is created in the K-shell (principal quantum number $n=1$).\n2.  An electron from the L-shell ($n=2$) transitions to fill the K-shell vacancy.\n3.
