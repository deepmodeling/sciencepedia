Hence B does not provide the reason in this setup.\n- The $L$-shell is occupied and the $M$-shell is empty, exactly the condition that permits Kα but prevents Kβ.

Hence D is false.\n- While $L$-shell electrons are indeed closer and generally produce stronger Kα intensity when both $n=2$ and $n=3$ are populated, the statement in E implies mere suppression rather than impossibility. Here the impossibility of Kβ arises from the absence of any $n=3$ electrons.
