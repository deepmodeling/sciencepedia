Mathematically, the Landé g-factor is not well-defined for a state with $J=0$ using this standard formula.\n\nNow, let's consider the physical behavior in a Stern-Gerlach experiment. The experiment separates atoms based on the z-component of their magnetic dipole moment, $\\mu_z$. The potential energy of an atom with magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in a magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is $U = - \\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{B}$.

The force on the atom in the z-direction is $F_z = -\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} = \\mu_z \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial z}$.\n\nThe number of beams the atomic beam splits into is determined by the number of possible values for $\\mu_z$. The operator for the z-component of the magnetic moment is given by:\n$$\\mu_z = -g_J \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e} M_J = -g_J \\mu_B M_J$$\nwhere $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton and $M_J$ is the magnetic quantum number associated with the total angular momentum $J$. The possible values of $M_J$ are $M_J = -J, -J+1, ..., J-1, J$.\n\nFor the $^3P_0$ state, the total angular momentum quantum number is $J=0$. The only possible value for the magnetic quantum number is $M_J = 0$.\nRegardless of the value of $g_J$, the product $g_J M_J$ will be zero since $M_J=0$. Thus, the z-component of the magnetic moment, $\\mu_z$, must be zero for every atom in this state.\n\nA more fundamental approach is to consider the total magnetic moment operator $\\vec{\\mu} = \\vec{\\mu}_L + \\vec{\\mu}_S = -\\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}(\\vec{L} + 2\\vec{S})$.

Consequently, the expectation value of the total angular momentum is zero, $\\langle \\vec{J} \\rangle = 0$. This implies that the total magnetic moment must also be zero, $\\langle \\vec{\\mu} \\rangle = 0$.\n\nSince the magnetic moment of every atom in the $^3P_0$ state is zero, the force on them in the Stern-Gerlach apparatus is $F_z = 0$. Therefore, the atoms pass through the apparatus undeflected. The atomic beam does not split and remains a single beam.\n\nCombining our findings:\n1.  The Landé g-factor formula yields an indeterminate form $0/0$.\n2.  The atoms in the $^3P_0$ state have zero total magnetic moment and are not deflected, meaning the beam does not split.\n\nThis corresponds to the choice: \"$g_J$ is indeterminate; the beam does not split and remains a single beam.\"\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. $g_J = 1.5$; the beam splits into 3 beams.
