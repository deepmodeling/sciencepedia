Let the internuclear axis be defined as the z-axis. The interaction and mixing of atomic orbitals (AOs) are governed by their relative energies, symmetry, and spatial overlap. In molecules like CO, which are isoelectronic with N$_2$ but feature atoms of different electronegativity, the phenomenon of s-p mixing significantly alters the energy ordering of the resulting molecular orbitals compared to a simple, unmixed model.\n\nThe Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the ground-state CO molecule is known to be of $\\sigma$ symmetry. Based on the principles of MO theory, including the effects of s-p mixing and the difference in electronegativity between carbon and oxygen, which of the following statements most accurately describes the dominant atomic orbital contributions to this HOMO?\n\nA.

Thus, for $\\sigma$ symmetry, the contributing AOs are $2s$ and $2p_{z}$ on each atom; for $\\pi$ symmetry, the contributing AOs are $2p_{x}$ and $2p_{y}$.\n\nFor a heteronuclear diatomic like CO, the one-electron AO energies satisfy $\\epsilon_{\\text{O},2s}<\\epsilon_{\\text{C},2s}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\text{O},2p}<\\epsilon_{\\text{C},2p}$ because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon.

Applied to the heteronuclear $2p_{z}$ pair, the bonding $\\sigma$ MO has more oxygen character, and the antibonding $\\sigma^{*}$ MO has more carbon character.\n\nIn CO, however, $\\sigma$ orbitals also undergo $s$–$p$ mixing because all $\\sigma$-symmetry AOs on both centers can couple. In particular, matrix elements of the form $H(2s,2p_{z})$ on the same center are symmetry-allowed in a heteronuclear diatomic (no inversion symmetry forbidding $g/u$ mixing), so the $\\sigma$ MOs arise from a four-orbital interaction among $\\{\\phi_{\\text{C},2s},\\phi_{\\text{C},2p_{z}},\\phi_{\\text{O},2s},\\phi_{\\text{O},2p_{z}}\\}$.
