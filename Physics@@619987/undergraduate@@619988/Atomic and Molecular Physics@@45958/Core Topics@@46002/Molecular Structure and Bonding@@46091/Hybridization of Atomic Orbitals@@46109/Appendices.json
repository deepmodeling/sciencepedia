This problem challenges you to move beyond simple prediction and explain an observed trend in bond angles by considering the role of electronegativity. By analyzing the difference between water ($H_2O$) and hydrogen sulfide ($H_2S$), you will develop a deeper appreciation for the physical principles that govern molecular structure. [@problem_id:1996296]", "problem": "In predicting molecular geometries, the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model is a powerful tool. It posits that electron domains around a central atom arrange themselves to minimize electrostatic repulsion. For a central atom with four electron domains, such as in water ($H_2O$) and hydrogen sulfide ($H_2S$), the electron geometry is based on a tetrahedron. Both molecules have two bonding pairs and two lone pairs (an $AX_2E_2$ structure). The presence of lone pairs, which exert a stronger repulsive force than bonding pairs, typically compresses the bond angle from the ideal tetrahedral angle of $\\arccos(-1/3) \\approx 109.5^\\circ$.\n\nExperimental measurements show that the $H-O-H$ bond angle in water is approximately $104.5^\\circ$. However, the $H-S-H$ bond angle in hydrogen sulfide is found to be significantly smaller, at approximately $92.1^\\circ$. A simple application of VSEPR theory might incorrectly predict similar bond angles for both molecules.\n\nGiven the electronegativity values on the Pauling scale (Hydrogen: 2.20, Sulfur: 2.58, Oxygen: 3.44), select the option that best explains why the bond angle in $H_2S$ is considerably smaller than that in $H_2O$.\n\nA. The lower electronegativity of sulfur compared to oxygen allows the bonding electron pairs in $H_2S$ to be further from the central atom, reducing the repulsion between the bonding pairs and allowing the lone pairs to compress the bond angle more effectively.\n\nB. The sulfur atom is larger than the oxygen atom. This increased size leads to greater steric hindrance between the two hydrogen atoms in $H_2S$, forcing them into a smaller bond angle.\n\nC. The sulfur atom in $H_2S$ does not form hybrid orbitals and uses its pure p-orbitals for bonding, which are naturally oriented at $90^\\circ$ to each other. In contrast, oxygen in $H_2O$ is $sp^3$ hybridized.\n\nD. The sulfur-hydrogen bond is significantly weaker than the oxygen-hydrogen bond. Weaker bonds are less rigid and are more easily compressed by the repulsive forces of the central atom's lone pairs.\n\nE. The two lone pairs on the sulfur atom are located in larger, more diffuse orbitals than those on the oxygen atom, causing the lone pairs themselves to have a greater repulsive effect that more strongly compresses the $H-S-H$ angle.", "solution": "The problem asks for the best explanation for the difference in bond angles between water ($H_2O$) and hydrogen sulfide ($H_2S$), given that both have the same $AX_2E_2$ VSEPR classification.\n\nStep 1: Initial VSEPR Analysis\nBoth $H_2O$ and $H_2S$ have a central atom (O or S) bonded to two hydrogen atoms and featuring two lone pairs. According to VSEPR theory, these four electron domains arrange themselves in a tetrahedral electron geometry to minimize repulsion. The molecular geometry is bent. The ideal tetrahedral angle is $109.5^\\circ$. The presence of two lone pairs, which occupy more space and are more repulsive than bonding pairs, compresses the bond angle in both molecules to a value less than $109.5^\\circ$. This initial analysis correctly predicts that both angles will be less than ideal but does not explain the significant difference between $104.5^\\circ$ for $H_2O$ and $92.1^\\circ$ for $H_2S$.\n\nStep 2: Incorporate the Effect of Central Atom Electronegativity\nTo explain the difference, we must consider a more subtle effect: the electronegativity of the central atom. The problem provides the electronegativity values: Oxygen ($\\chi_O \\approx 3.44$) is significantly more electronegative than Sulfur ($\\chi_S \\approx 2.58$).\n\nStep 3: Analyze $H_2O$\nIn water, the highly electronegative oxygen atom strongly pulls the shared electrons of the O-H covalent bonds towards itself. This means the electron density of the bonding pairs is concentrated closer to the central oxygen atom. As a result, these two bonding pairs are relatively close to each other, and the electrostatic repulsion between them is strong. This bond pair-bond pair repulsion effectively resists the compressive force from the two lone pairs, resulting in a wider bond angle of $104.5^\\circ$.\n\nStep 4: Analyze $H_2S$\nIn hydrogen sulfide, the central sulfur atom is less electronegative. Consequently, it does not pull the shared electrons of the S-H bonds as strongly as oxygen does. The electron density of the bonding pairs is therefore located further from the central sulfur atom and, relatively speaking, closer to the hydrogen atoms. Because the two bonding pairs are physically further apart from each other, their mutual electrostatic repulsion is weaker compared to the case in water.\n\nStep 5: Synthesize and Compare\nWith weaker repulsion between the bonding pairs in $H_2S$, the compressive force exerted by the two lone pairs on the sulfur atom becomes more dominant. The lone pair-bond pair repulsion can more easily push the S-H bonds closer together. This leads to a much smaller $H-S-H$ bond angle of $92.1^\\circ$. This explanation directly links the central atom's electronegativity to the spatial distribution of bonding electrons and the resulting molecular geometry. Thus, option A is the correct explanation.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the incorrect options.\n- Option B is incorrect. While sulfur is larger than oxygen, the S-H bond length is also longer than the O-H bond length (approx. 134 pm vs. 96 pm). This actually gives the hydrogen atoms more room, so steric hindrance between them is not the cause of the smaller angle; it would intuitively suggest a larger angle if anything.\n- Option C presents an alternative model that is sometimes used. While the $92.1^\\circ$ angle is very close to the $90^\\circ$ of unhybridized p-orbitals, the electronegativity argument provides a more consistent explanation within the VSEPR framework for the trend observed down the group (angles in $H_2Se$ and $H_2Te$ are even closer to $90^\\circ$). The VSEPR/electronegativity model explains the *trend* as a continuous effect, whereas the hybrid/unhybridized model is a more binary switch. Therefore, option A is considered the better and more fundamental explanation at this level.\n- Option D incorrectly correlates bond strength with bond angle. Bond strength is about the energy of the bond, not the spatial distribution of the electron cloud that dictates VSEPR geometry. The relevant factor is the repulsion between electron domains, which is governed by their location (electronegativity), not their dissociation energy.\n- Option E is misleading. The primary difference in repulsive forces that determines the *change* in angle comes from the change in the position of the *bonding pairs*, not from a change in the intrinsic repulsiveness of the lone pairs. The weaker bond-pair repulsion in $H_2S$ is what *allows* the lone-pair repulsion to be more effective.\n\nBased on this step-by-step reasoning, the most accurate explanation is the one described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1996296"}, {"introduction": "The concept of integer hybridization ($sp$, $sp^2$, $sp^3$) is a powerful simplification, but what happens in highly strained molecules where ideal bond angles are impossible?
