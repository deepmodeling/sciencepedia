Thus the total is\n$$5 + 2 \\times 6 - 1 = 16 \\text{ electrons}.$$\nA reasonable Lewis structure places N in the center with two O atoms. To satisfy octets with $16$ electrons, N forms two double bonds to O. Each O then has two lone pairs, and N has no lone pairs.

Selenium (Se) is less electronegative than Oxygen (O), so Se is the central atom.\n\nSecond, we calculate the total number of valence electrons in the ion.\n- Selenium (Se) is in Group 16 of the periodic table, so it contributes 6 valence electrons.\n- Oxygen (O) is also in Group 16, so each of the three oxygen atoms contributes 6 valence electrons, for a total of $3 \\times 6 = 18$ electrons.\n- The ion has a charge of $2-$, which means we must add 2 additional electrons to the total count.\nTotal valence electrons = (valence electrons of Se) + 3 * (valence electrons of O) + (charge)\nTotal valence electrons = $6 + 3 \\times 6 + 2 = 6 + 18 + 2 = 26$ electrons.\n\nThird, we draw a plausible Lewis structure to determine the connectivity and distribution of electrons. We connect the three oxygen atoms to the central selenium atom with single bonds. This uses $3 \\times 2 = 6$ electrons.\n$26 - 6 = 20$ electrons remain.\nNext, we distribute these remaining electrons as lone pairs to the terminal atoms (oxygen) to satisfy their octets. Each oxygen atom needs 6 more electrons (3 lone pairs) to complete its octet. For three oxygen atoms, this requires $3 \\times 6 = 18$ electrons.\n$20 - 18 = 2$ electrons remain.\nFinally, we place the last 2 electrons on the central atom, selenium, as a lone pair.\nThe resulting Lewis structure shows the central selenium atom bonded to three oxygen atoms and having one lone pair.\n\nFourth, we determine the number of electron domains (also known as the steric number) around the central selenium atom. An electron domain is a region where electrons are likely to be found, which includes bonding pairs (single, double, or triple bonds count as one domain) and lone pairs.\n- Number of bonding domains = 3 (for the three Se-O bonds).\n- Number of lone pair domains = 1 (for the one lone pair on Se).\nThe total number of electron domains (steric number) is $3 + 1 = 4$.\n\nFifth, we determine the electron geometry. The electron geometry is determined by the total number of electron domains. A steric number of 4 corresponds to a geometry that minimizes repulsion among the four domains, which is a **tetrahedral** arrangement. The electron pairs are directed towards the vertices of a tetrahedron.\n\nSixth, we determine the molecular geometry. The molecular geometry describes the arrangement of only the atoms, not the lone pairs. The general VSEPR formula for this ion is $AX_3E_1$, where A is the central atom, X represents the bonded atoms, and E represents the lone pairs.\nWith a tetrahedral electron geometry, one of the four vertices is occupied by a lone pair. The remaining three vertices are occupied by the oxygen atoms. The resulting shape formed by the selenium and the three oxygen atoms is a **trigonal pyramidal** geometry. The lone pair repels the bonding pairs slightly more than they repel each other, causing the O-Se-O bond angles to be slightly less than the ideal tetrahedral angle of $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nComparing our results with the given options:\n- Electron Geometry: Tetrahedral\n- Molecular Geometry: Trigonal pyramidal\n\nThis matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2045824"}, {"introduction": "VSEPR theory's predictive power extends beyond single molecules to explaining trends across a series of related compounds.
