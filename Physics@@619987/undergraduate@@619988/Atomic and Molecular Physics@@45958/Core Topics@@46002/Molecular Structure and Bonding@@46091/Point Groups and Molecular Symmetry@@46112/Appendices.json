Due to the nearly free rotation around this single bond, the molecule can exist in different spatial arrangements of its hydrogen atoms, known as conformations. We will consider two idealized, limiting conformations.\n\n1.  **Eclipsed Conformation**: When viewed along the carbon-carbon bond axis, the hydrogen atoms on the front carbon atom are directly aligned with the hydrogen atoms on the rear carbon atom.\n2.  **Staggered Conformation**: When viewed along the carbon-carbon bond axis, the hydrogen atoms on the front carbon atom are positioned exactly between the hydrogen atoms on the rear carbon atom.\n\nMolecular symmetry is described by a set of symmetry elements. For this problem, consider the following definitions, where the principal axis is the highest-order rotation axis, which for ethane is the axis passing through the two carbon atoms.\n-   **Horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$)**: A plane of reflection that is perpendicular to the principal axis.\n-   **Dihedral mirror plane ($\\sigma_d$)**: A plane of reflection that contains the principal axis and bisects the angle between two adjacent 2-fold rotation axes that are perpendicular to the principal axis.\n-   **Inversion center ($i$)**: A point at the center of the molecule such that for any atom, an identical atom exists at the same distance on the exact opposite side of the center.\n-   **Improper rotation axis of order 6 ($S_6$)**: An axis around which a rotation by $360^\\circ/6 = 60^\\circ$, followed by a reflection in a plane perpendicular to that axis, maps the molecule onto itself.\n\nWhich of the following symmetry elements is present in the eclipsed conformation of ethane but is absent in the staggered conformation?\n\nA.

We compare symmetry elements by determining whether each listed element maps the molecule onto itself in each conformation.\n\n1. Test for a horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_{h}$:\n- In the eclipsed conformation, consider the plane perpendicular to the $C_{3}$ axis passing through the midpoint of the C–C bond. Reflection in this plane swaps the two $CH_{3}$ groups and, because the hydrogens are aligned (eclipsed), each hydrogen on the front carbon is mapped onto an identical hydrogen directly behind it. Therefore, $\\sigma_{h}$ is present in the eclipsed conformation.\n- In the staggered conformation, the same plane would map each hydrogen on the front carbon to a position midway between hydrogens on the rear carbon due to the $60^{\\circ}$ offset. Hence, it does not map atoms onto identical atoms, so $\\sigma_{h}$ is absent in the staggered conformation.\n\n2. Check the other listed elements to ensure they do not satisfy the condition:\n- $\\sigma_{d}$ (dihedral mirror plane): Present in the staggered conformation (point group $D_{3d}$), absent in the eclipsed conformation (which has $\\sigma_{v}$ instead, in $D_{3h}$). Therefore, not present only in eclipsed.\n- $i$ (inversion center): Present in the staggered conformation ($D_{3d}$), absent in the eclipsed conformation ($D_{3h}$).

The two terminal $\\text{CH}_2$ groups are planar and mutually perpendicular: choose the upper terminal group to lie in the $xz$-plane and the lower terminal group to lie in the $yz$-plane. The hydrogens at each end are equivalent and symmetrically disposed in their respective planes about the $z$-axis.\n\nIdentify the symmetry elements and operations:\n\n1) Identity $E$ is always present.\n\n2) A $C_{2}$ rotation about the $z$-axis: the operation $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,-y,z)$ swaps the two hydrogens on the top end within the $xz$-plane and also swaps the two hydrogens on the bottom end within the $yz$-plane, leaving the molecule indistinguishable. Thus a $C_{2}$ along the molecular axis is present.\n\n3) Two $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to $z$: choose them along the $x$- and $y$-axes through the central carbon. A $C_{2}$ about the $x$-axis, $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(x,-y,-z)$, interchanges the two terminal ends (top and bottom) and exchanges the two hydrogens within each end, preserving the structure. Similarly, a $C_{2}$ about the $y$-axis, $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-x,y,-z)$, also maps the molecule onto itself. Hence there are two mutually perpendicular $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to the molecular axis.\n\n4) An $S_{4}$ improper rotation about the $z$-axis: an $S_{4}$ is a rotation by $\\pi/2$ about $z$ followed by reflection in the plane perpendicular to $z$ (the $xy$-plane). Symbolically, one $S_{4}$ acts as $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(y,-x,-z)$.

The presence of a $C_{5}$ axis together with five perpendicular $C_{2}$ axes is characteristic of a $D_{5}$-type point group.\n\n3) Mirror planes: There is no horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_{h}$ (a plane perpendicular to the $C_{5}$ axis through the iron) because reflecting top to bottom without an accompanying rotation would not superimpose the staggered arrangement. Instead, there are five dihedral mirror planes $\\sigma_{d}$ that contain the $C_{5}$ axis and bisect the angles between adjacent $C_{2}$ axes, consistent with a $D_{5d}$ point group. Moreover, there is an inversion center at the iron atom that maps each atom on the top ring to a corresponding atom on the bottom ring.\n\n4) Improper rotation axis: Even though $\\sigma_{h}$ is absent as an independent element, the molecule possesses an improper rotation axis $S_{10}$ along the principal axis. The operation $S_{10}$ is defined as a rotation by $2\\pi/10$ followed by reflection through a plane perpendicular to the axis. For staggered ferrocene, a rotation by $2\\pi/10$ (which is $36^{\\circ}$) about the principal axis followed by reflection in the plane midway between the rings maps the molecule onto itself because the $36^{\\circ}$ rotation aligns each atom with the appropriate site in the opposite ring and the reflection swaps top and bottom.
