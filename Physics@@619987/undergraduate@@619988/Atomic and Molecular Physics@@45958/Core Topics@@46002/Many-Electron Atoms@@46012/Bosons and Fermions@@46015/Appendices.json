Consequently, there is no Pauli Exclusion Principle restriction on occupying identical one-electron states. For noninteracting identical bosons in an external potential, the ground state places all particles in the lowest single-particle orbital, which is the statement of Bose-Einstein condensation: if the single-particle Hamiltonian is $h$ with eigenstates $h\\psi_{n}=\\epsilon_{n}\\psi_{n}$ ordered by $\\epsilon_{1}<\\epsilon_{2}<\\dots$, then the noninteracting ground state for $N$ bosons occupies $\\psi_{1}$ with occupation number $N$.\n\nIn an atom, the single-electron orbitals are the hydrogenic-like orbitals modified by electron screening; the lowest-energy orbital is the $1s$ orbital. Thus, in the noninteracting limit, all $N=4$ bosonic electrons would occupy the $1s$ orbital, giving $1s^4$.\n\nIncluding electron-electron repulsion, the ground-state energy in a bosonic Hartree description for $N$ identical bosons in an external potential with two-body interaction $V_{\\mathrm{ee}}(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')$ is minimized by a single normalized orbital $\\phi$ that all particles occupy, minimizing the energy functional\n$$\nE[\\phi]=N\\langle\\phi|h|\\phi\\rangle+\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}\\iint |\\phi(\\mathbf{r})|^{2}V_{\\mathrm{ee}}(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')|\\phi(\\mathbf{r}')|^{2}\\,d^{3}r\\,d^{3}r'.\n$$\nThis variational principle yields a single-orbital condensate as the ground state for repulsive interactions in an external attractive potential; the optimal $\\phi$ self-consistently broadens to balance nuclear attraction and interelectronic repulsion but remains the lowest-energy occupied orbital.
