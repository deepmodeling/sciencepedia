By calculating the ground state energy under the classical (and incorrect) assumption that identical fermions are distinguishable, and then comparing it to the true quantum mechanical energy, we can directly quantify the energetic \"cost\" imposed by the Pauli exclusion principle.

Two identical, non-interacting particles, each of mass $m$, are confined within this well. The particles are spin-1/2 fermions. We wish to compare the ground state energy of the system under two different theoretical models.\n\nFirst, as a thought experiment, calculate the ground state energy, which we will call $E_{dist}$, for this two-particle system under the incorrect assumption that the particles are distinguishable. For this case, you can imagine the particles can be individually labeled and their combined wavefunction does not need to be symmetrized according to the principles of quantum statistics.\n\nNext, consider the actual physical situation where the particles are treated correctly as indistinguishable spin-1/2 fermions. For this specific problem, assume the two fermions are prepared in the same spin state (i.e., they are spin-polarized).

The total wavefunction of identical fermions must be antisymmetric under particle exchange, so the spatial part must be antisymmetric.
