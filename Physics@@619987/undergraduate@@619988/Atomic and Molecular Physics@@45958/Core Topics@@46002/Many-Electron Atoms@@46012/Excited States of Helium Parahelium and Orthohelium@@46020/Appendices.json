This exercise challenges you to apply this principle at its deepest level, using the symmetry of the total wavefunction to explain why certain seemingly possible states are in fact forbidden. Understanding this concept is the very foundation for grasping why helium's energy levels are divided into the two distinct families of parahelium and orthohelium [@problem_id:1991217].", "problem": "In quantum mechanics, the state of a multi-electron atom is described by a total wavefunction that must obey specific symmetry rules because electrons are indistinguishable fermions. For a helium atom, which has two electrons, the total wavefunction $\\Psi(1, 2)$ can be expressed as a product of a spatial part $\\psi(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2)$ and a spin part $\\chi(s_1, s_2)$. The Pauli Exclusion Principle requires that the total wavefunction $\\Psi(1, 2)$ must be antisymmetric upon the exchange of the two electrons, i.e., $\\Psi(2, 1) = -\\Psi(1, 2)$.\n\nAtomic states are classified using spectroscopic notation, $^{(2S+1)}L_J$, where $S$ is the total spin angular momentum quantum number, $L$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number. For a state with two electrons in the same orbital, like the $1s^2$ configuration, the spatial part of the wavefunction is symmetric under particle exchange.\n\nA student analyzes the ground state electronic configuration of helium, $1s^2$, and hypothesizes that a state with the term symbol $^3S_1$ could exist for this configuration. Which of the following statements provides the correct quantum mechanical reason why the $^3S_1$ state for the $1s^2$ configuration of helium is forbidden?\n\nA. The rules of angular momentum coupling do not permit a total orbital angular momentum of $L=0$ and a total spin angular momentum of $S=1$ to combine to produce a total angular momentum of $J=1$.\n\nB. For a $1s^2$ configuration, the spatial wavefunction is symmetric. The proposed $^3S$ term corresponds to a triplet spin state ($S=1$), which has a symmetric spin wavefunction. The product of these two symmetric functions results in a total wavefunction that is symmetric, violating the Pauli Exclusion Principle.\n\nC. The energy of a triplet state ($S=1$) is always higher than the corresponding singlet state ($S=0$) due to exchange forces, making the $^3S_1$ state energetically unstable and thus non-existent for the ground state configuration.\n\nD. The selection rules for electric dipole transitions, $\\Delta S = 0$, make it impossible to form a triplet state ($S=1$) from the singlet ground state, so the $^3S_1$ state can never be occupied.\n\nE.
