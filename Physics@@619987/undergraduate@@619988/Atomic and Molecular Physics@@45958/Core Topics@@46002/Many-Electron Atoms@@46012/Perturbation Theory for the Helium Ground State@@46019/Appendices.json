In this model, the electrostatic repulsion between the two electrons is completely ignored. The energy levels for a single electron in the potential of a nucleus with charge $+Ze$ are given by the formula $E_n = -Z^2 \\frac{E_R}{n^2}$, where $n$ is the principal quantum number and $E_R$ is the Rydberg energy, which has a value of approximately $13.606$ eV (electron-volts).\n\nUsing this simplified model, calculate the total energy required to remove both electrons from a helium atom that is initially in its ground state.

Each electron moves in the central potential of the helium nucleus, which has a charge of $+Ze$ with $Z=2$. The total Hamiltonian of the system is the sum of two independent hydrogen-like Hamiltonians: $H = H_1 + H_2$. Consequently, the total energy of the atom is the sum of the energies of the two individual electrons, $E_{\\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2$.\n\nThe energy of a single electron in a hydrogen-like atom with nuclear charge $Z$ and principal quantum number $n$ is given by the formula:\n$$E_n = -Z^2 \\frac{E_R}{n^2}$$\nwhere $E_R = 13.606 \\, \\text{eV}$ is the Rydberg energy.\n\nFor the helium atom, the nuclear charge corresponds to $Z=2$. The ground state of the atom is the state where both electrons occupy the lowest possible energy level. The lowest energy level corresponds to the principal quantum number $n=1$.\n\nTherefore, the energy of the first electron in the ground state is:\n$$E_1 = E_{n=1, Z=2} = -2^2 \\frac{E_R}{1^2} = -4 E_R$$\n\nSimilarly, the energy of the second electron in the ground state is:\n$$E_2 = E_{n=1, Z=2} = -2^2 \\frac{E_R}{1^2} = -4 E_R$$\n\nThe total energy of the helium atom in its ground state, within this model, is the sum of the energies of the two electrons:\n$$E_{\\text{ground}} = E_1 + E_2 = -4E_R + (-4E_R) = -8E_R$$\n\nThis value, $E_{\\text{ground}}$, represents the energy of the bound system relative to a state where the nucleus and the two electrons are all infinitely separated and at rest (which is defined as the zero-energy state). The energy required to remove both electrons is the energy needed to go from the ground state to this zero-energy state. This required energy is exactly the negative of the ground state energy.\n$$E_{\\text{required}} = 0 - E_{\\text{ground}} = -E_{\\text{ground}} = -(-8E_R) = 8E_R$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical value for the Rydberg energy, $E_R = 13.606 \\, \\text{eV}$:\n$$E_{\\text{required}} = 8 \\times 13.606 \\, \\text{eV}$$\n$$E_{\\text{required}} = 108.848 \\, \\text{eV}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of $108.848$ are $1, 0, 8, 8$.

Understanding this ratio is crucial for judging whether perturbation theory is a valid approach for the helium atom and for predicting how quickly the series of energy corrections will converge to the true value.", "problem": "A computational physicist is developing a model for the ground state of a neutral helium atom.

Based on your calculation of this ratio for helium, which of the following statements provides the most accurate physical interpretation of the result?\n\nA. The ratio $\\lambda$ is very close to zero ($\\lambda \\ll 1$), indicating the perturbation is negligible. The perturbation series converges extremely rapidly, and the first-order corrected energy $E^{(0)} + E^{(1)}$ is a highly accurate representation of the true ground state energy.\n\nB. The ratio $\\lambda$ is approximately equal to 1, which signifies that the repulsion energy between electrons is similar in magnitude to their binding energy to the nucleus. The perturbation series is expected to diverge, rendering this approach invalid for helium.\n\nC. The ratio $\\lambda$ is a value between 0.2 and 0.4. This indicates that the electron-electron repulsion is a significant, but not dominant, effect. The perturbation series is expected to converge, but not rapidly, making the first-order correction a reasonable but rough approximation of the true energy.\n\nD. The ratio $\\lambda$ is a value between 0.6 and 0.8, indicating that the perturbation is the dominant energy contribution. While the series may still converge, the first-order result is A poor approximation, and many higher-order terms are required.\n\nE. The value of $\\lambda$ is irrelevant to the convergence of the series.
