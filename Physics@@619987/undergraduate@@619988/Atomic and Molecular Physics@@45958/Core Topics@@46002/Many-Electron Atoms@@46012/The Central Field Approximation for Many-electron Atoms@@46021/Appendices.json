However, this degeneracy is lifted in many-electron atoms, where the energy also depends on the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$. This first practice explores the fundamental reason for this energy splitting, guiding you to develop a qualitative understanding of electron shielding and orbital penetrationâ€”the cornerstone concepts of the central field approximation [@problem_id:2029871].", "problem": "In the central field approximation for a multi-electron atom, each electron is assumed to move in an effective, spherically symmetric potential, $V_{\\text{eff}}(r)$, generated by the nucleus and the time-averaged charge distribution of all other electrons. This potential deviates from the pure Coulomb potential of a single-electron atom, primarily because the inner-shell electrons \"shield\" the nuclear charge from the outer-shell electrons. The degree to which an electron in a particular orbital \"penetrates\" this inner-electron shield is determined by its orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$. An orbital that penetrates more effectively allows the electron to experience a stronger attraction from the nucleus, making it more tightly bound and lowering its energy.\n\nConsider a valence electron in a potassium atom (K, atomic number $Z=19$). We are interested in the relative energies of the electronic states with the principal quantum number $n=3$, specifically the $3s$, $3p$, and $3d$ states. Let the energies of an electron in these orbitals be denoted by $E_{3s}$, $E_{3p}$, and $E_{3d}$, respectively.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly orders these energies and provides the correct physical reasoning based on the concepts of shielding and penetration?\n\nA. $E_{3d} < E_{3p} < E_{3s}$. This is because orbitals with higher $l$ values have more eccentric classical orbits, allowing them to penetrate closer to the nucleus and experience a stronger effective nuclear charge.\n\nB. $E_{3s} < E_{3p} < E_{3d}$. This is because orbitals with lower $l$ values have a higher probability density near the nucleus, a region where shielding by inner electrons is least effective, leading to a more negative potential energy.\n\nC. $E_{3s} = E_{3p} = E_{3d}$. This is because in any spherically symmetric potential, the energy depends only on the principal quantum number $n$, just as in the hydrogen atom.\n\nD. $E_{3s} < E_{3p} < E_{3d}$. This is because orbitals with lower $l$ values spend more time, on average, farther from the nucleus, where the screened potential is weaker, thus lowering their total energy.\n\nE. $E_{3d} < E_{3s} < E_{3p}$. This ordering is an anomalous effect specific to alkali metals and cannot be explained by simple penetration and shielding arguments.", "solution": "The problem asks for the correct energy ordering of the $3s$, $3p$, and $3d$ orbitals in a potassium atom and the physical reasoning behind it. This ordering is a direct consequence of the effects of electron shielding and orbital penetration in a multi-electron atom.\n\nFirst, let's recall the model. In a multi-electron atom, an electron experiences a potential $V_{\\text{eff}}(r)$ that is due to the positive nucleus and the negative charge cloud of the other electrons. At very small radii ($r \\to 0$), inside the charge cloud of the core electrons, the shielding effect is minimal, and the electron experiences a potential approaching that of the bare nucleus, $V(r) \\approx -Ze^2/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r)$. At very large radii ($r \\to \\infty$), the nucleus and the $Z-1$ other electrons are seen as a single point charge of $+1e$, so the potential approaches the hydrogen-like form, $V(r) \\approx -e^2/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r)$. Because of this variation, the potential is not a pure $1/r$ potential.\n\nThe energy of an electron in such a non-Coulombic central potential depends on both the principal quantum number $n$ and the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$. The degeneracy in $l$ that exists for the hydrogen atom is lifted.\n\nThe key to determining the energy ordering for a fixed $n$ is the concept of penetration. The radial probability distribution of an electron's wavefunction determines how much time it spends at different distances from the nucleus. For a given principal quantum number $n$, orbitals with a lower orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ have a higher probability of being found at small radii (i.e., they \"penetrate\" the inner electron shells more effectively).\n\nSpecifically, for $n=3$:\n- The $3s$ orbital ($l=0$) has a non-zero probability density at the nucleus ($r=0$) and significant inner lobes in its radial wavefunction. This means a $3s$ electron spends a considerable amount of time very close to the nucleus.\n- The $3p$ orbital ($l=1$) has zero probability density at the nucleus, and its probability density peaks farther out than the main peak of the $1s, 2s,$ and $2p$ core orbitals. It penetrates the core less than the $3s$ orbital.\n- The $3d$ orbital ($l=2$) has a radial probability distribution that is concentrated even farther from the nucleus and has negligible probability of being found inside the core electron shells. It is the least penetrating of the three.\n\nThe penetration order is therefore: $3s > 3p > 3d$.\n\nGreater penetration means the electron spends more time in the region close to the nucleus where shielding is less effective. In this region, the electron experiences a potential that is more negative (stronger attraction) than an electron in a less penetrating orbital would. A stronger average attraction to the nucleus results in the electron being more tightly bound, which corresponds to a lower (more negative) total energy.\n\nTherefore, the orbital with the most penetration has the lowest energy. Following the penetration order, the energy order must be:\n$E_{3s} < E_{3p} < E_{3d}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n- A: Incorrect energy ordering. The reasoning is also flawed; higher $l$ corresponds to less penetration, not more.\n- B: Correct energy ordering ($E_{3s} < E_{3p} < E_{3d}$) and correct reasoning. Lower $l$ values correspond to higher probability density near the nucleus (penetration), where shielding is weaker. This leads to a lower (more negative) potential energy contribution and a more tightly bound state.\n- C: Incorrect. This is only true for a pure $1/r$ potential, such as in the hydrogen atom. The effective potential in a multi-electron atom is not a $1/r$ potential.\n- D: Correct energy ordering, but incorrect reasoning. The lower energy of low-$l$ orbitals is due to spending more time *closer* to the nucleus, not farther away.\n- E: Incorrect energy ordering and incorrect reasoning. The effect is not anomalous and is well-described by the central field model with shielding and penetration.\n\nThus, statement B provides the correct ordering and the correct physical explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2029871"}, {"introduction": "Building on the qualitative concept of shielding, this exercise demonstrates how to quantify its effects and make testable predictions. You will apply a set of simple, empirical rules to calculate the effective nuclear charge, $Z_{eff}$, for a valence electron in a lithium atom.

This parameter accounts for the repulsive effect of the other \"core\" electrons.\n\nThe screening parameter $\\sigma$ for the electron of interest is calculated using the following set of empirical rules based on the grouping of other electrons:\n1.
