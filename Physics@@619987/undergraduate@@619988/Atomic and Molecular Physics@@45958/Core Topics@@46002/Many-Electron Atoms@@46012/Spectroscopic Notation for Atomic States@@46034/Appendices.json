The ground state configuration is determined by applying a set of empirical guidelines known as Hund's rules.\n\nConsider two negative ions in the gas phase: the phosphide ion, P$^{-}$ (formed from a phosphorus atom, $Z=15$), and the sulfide ion, S$^{-}$ (formed from a sulfur atom, $Z=16$).

The total angular momentum quantum number $J$ is zero for both ions, i.e., $J_P = J_S = 0$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to compare the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$, for the ground states of the phosphide ion (P$^{-}$) and the sulfide ion (S$^{-}$). To do this, we must first determine the electron configuration of each ion and then apply Hund's rules to find their ground state term symbols, which are of the form $^{2S+1}L_J$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the electron configuration of the valence shell for each ion.\nA neutral phosphorus atom (P, $Z=15$) has the electron configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^3$. The phosphide ion, P$^{-}$, has one additional electron, so its configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^4$. The valence shell is $3p^4$.\nA neutral sulfur atom (S, $Z=16$) has the electron configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^4$. The sulfide ion, S$^{-}$, has one additional electron, so its configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^5$. The valence shell is $3p^5$.\n\nNow, we apply Hund's rules to find the ground state term for each ion. The p-subshell ($l=1$) has three orbitals, corresponding to magnetic quantum numbers $m_l = +1, 0, -1$.\n\n**Analysis for the Phosphide Ion (P$^{-}$), configuration $3p^4$:**\n\n1.  **Hund's First Rule: Maximize the total spin quantum number S.**\n    To maximize $S$, we must place as many electrons as possible with the same spin into different orbitals. With four electrons in the p-subshell, we place one electron in each of the three orbitals with spin up ($m_s = +1/2$), and the fourth electron must pair up in one orbital with spin down ($m_s = -1/2$).\n    The spins are: $\\uparrow$ in $m_l=+1$, $\\uparrow$ in $m_l=0$, $\\uparrow$ in $m_l=-1$, and $\\downarrow$ in one of them (say, $m_l=+1$).\n    The total spin is $S = \\sum m_s = (+1/2) + (+1/2) + (+1/2) + (-1/2) = 1$.\n    The spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$.\n\n2.  **Hund's Second Rule: Maximize the total orbital angular momentum quantum number L for the given S.**\n    To maximize $L = |\\sum m_l|$, we fill the orbitals with higher $m_l$ values first. The configuration that maximizes $S$ is achieved by placing electrons as follows: two electrons in $m_l=+1$, one in $m_l=0$, and one in $m_l=-1$.\n    The total orbital angular momentum is $L = |\\sum m_l| = |(+1) + (+1) + (0) + (-1)| = 1$.\n    The spectroscopic symbol for $L=1$ is P. So the term is a $^3\\text{P}$ term.\n\n3.  **Hund's Third Rule: Determine the total angular momentum quantum number J.**\n    The possible values of $J$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series: $|L-S|, |L-S|+1, \\ldots, L+S$.\n    For P$^{-}$, $L=1$ and $S=1$, so the possible values for $J$ are $|1-1|, |1-1|+1, 1+1$, which are $J=0, 1, 2$.\n    The rule for determining the ground state $J$ depends on whether the subshell is less than or more than half-filled. A p-subshell can hold $2(2l+1) = 2(2(1)+1) = 6$ electrons. The $3p$ subshell of P$^{-}$ has 4 electrons, so it is more than half-filled. For a subshell that is more than half-filled, the ground state is the one with the maximum possible value of $J$.\n    Therefore, for P$^{-}$, the ground state has $J_P = 2$. The full term symbol is $^3\\text{P}_2$.\n\n**Analysis for the Sulfide Ion (S$^{-}$), configuration $3p^5$:**\n\n1.  **Hund's First Rule: Maximize S.**\n    With five electrons, we place spin-up electrons in all three orbitals, and then two spin-down electrons into two of the orbitals.\n    The spins are: $\\uparrow$ in $m_l=+1$, $\\uparrow$ in $m_l=0$, $\\uparrow$ in $m_l=-1$, $\\downarrow$ in $m_l=+1$, and $\\downarrow$ in $m_l=0$.\n    The total spin is $S = \\sum m_s = 3(+1/2) + 2(-1/2) = 3/2 - 1 = 1/2$.\n    The spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(1/2)+1 = 2$.\n\n2.  **Hund's Second Rule: Maximize L.**\n    The configuration that maximizes S corresponds to two electrons in $m_l=+1$, two in $m_l=0$, and one in $m_l=-1$.\n    The total orbital angular momentum is $L = |\\sum m_l| = |(+1) + (+1) + (0) + (0) + (-1)| = 1$.\n    The spectroscopic symbol for $L=1$ is P. So the term is a $^2\\text{P}$ term. (This could also be seen using the electron-hole equivalency; a $p^5$ configuration behaves like a single $p^1$ hole, which has $L=1, S=1/2$).\n\n3.  **Hund's Third Rule: Determine J.**\n    For S$^{-}$, $L=1$ and $S=1/2$. The possible values for $J$ are $|1-1/2|, \\ldots, 1+1/2$, which are $J=1/2, 3/2$.\n    The $3p$ subshell of S$^{-}$ has 5 electrons, so it is also more than half-filled. Thus, the ground state has the maximum possible value of $J$.\n    Therefore, for S$^{-}$, the ground state has $J_S = 3/2$. The full term symbol is $^2\\text{P}_{3/2}$.\n\n**Comparison:**\nWe have found that the total angular momentum quantum number for the ground state of the phosphide ion is $J_P = 2$, and for the sulfide ion is $J_S = 3/2 = 1.5$.\nComparing these two values, we see that $2 > 1.5$, so $J_P > J_S$.\nThis corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2024525"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying the ground state, a complete understanding of an atom requires knowledge of all its possible excited electronic states.
