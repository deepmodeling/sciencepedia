Consider an experiment with atomic deuterium, whose nucleus (a deuteron) has a nuclear spin quantum number of $I=1$. We are interested in the spontaneous emission of a photon as the atom decays from an excited state in the $2P_{3/2}$ fine-structure multiplet to a state in the $2S_{1/2}$ multiplet.

The total angular momentum vector is given by the sum of the total electronic angular momentum vector and the nuclear spin vector, $\\vec{F} = \\vec{J} + \\vec{I}$. The possible values of the quantum number $F$ range in integer steps from $|J-I|$ to $J+I$.
