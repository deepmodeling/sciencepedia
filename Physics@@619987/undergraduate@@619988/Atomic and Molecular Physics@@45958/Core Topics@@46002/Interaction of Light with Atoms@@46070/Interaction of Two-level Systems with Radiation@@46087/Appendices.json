When a two-level atom is driven by a resonant laser, its quantum state oscillates between the ground and excited states, a phenomenon known as Rabi oscillations. This exercise [@problem_id:1998301] provides a practical application of this principle, linking a laser's intensity to the time required to perform a specific quantum operation, which is the foundation of many quantum technologies.", "problem": "In the field of quantum computing, a fundamental operation is the quantum NOT gate, which flips a quantum bit (qubit) from its ground state, denoted $|0\\rangle$, to its excited state, $|1\\rangle$. One common physical implementation of a qubit is a two-level atom. This state flip can be induced by applying a precisely timed pulse from a laser that is resonant with the atom's transition frequency.\n\nAn engineer is evaluating two laser systems for this purpose. The first system uses a laser with a constant intensity $I_1$ and successfully performs the NOT gate operation in a time interval $t_1$. A second, more powerful laser system with a constant intensity $I_2 = 4 I_1$ is then used. This second system achieves the same NOT gate operation in a time interval $t_2$.\n\nAssume that for both systems, the interaction can be modeled by the electric dipole approximation, where the rate of transition between the states is governed by the Rabi frequency, $\\Omega$. The Rabi frequency is directly proportional to the amplitude of the laser's electric field. Furthermore, the intensity of the laser is proportional to the square of its electric field amplitude. For both operations, the atom is initially in the ground state $|0\\rangle$, and the pulse duration is the shortest possible time required to reach the excited state $|1\\rangle$ with certainty.\n\nCalculate the numerical value of the ratio of the pulse durations, $t_2/t_1$.", "solution": "The resonant Rabi dynamics for a two-level atom driven in the electric dipole approximation give the excited-state population as\n$$\nP_{1}(t)=\\sin^{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\Omega t}{2}\\right),\n$$\nso the shortest pulse that transfers all population from $|0\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$ satisfies\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega t}{2}=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad t=\\frac{\\pi}{\\Omega}.\n$$\nThe Rabi frequency is proportional to the electric field amplitude, $\\Omega\\propto E$, and the laser intensity is proportional to the square of the field, $I\\propto E^{2}$.

The ground energy level, $E_1$, has a statistical degeneracy of $g_1$, and its population is $N_1$. The excited energy level, $E_2$, has a degeneracy of $g_2$ and a population of $N_2$. The atoms are optically pumped by an incoherent light source with a spectral energy density $\\rho(\\nu)$ at the transition frequency $\\nu = (E_2 - E_1)/h$, where $h$ is Planck's constant. The rates of change of the populations are governed by the processes of absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission, characterized by the Einstein coefficients $A_{21}$ (for spontaneous emission), $B_{12}$ (for absorption), and $B_{21}$ (for stimulated emission). The relationship between the coefficients for absorption and stimulated emission is given by the well-known relation $g_1 B_{12} = g_2 B_{21}$.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a steady state under the influence of the pumping radiation, what is the theoretical maximum value for the population ratio $N_2/N_1$ that can be achieved in the limit of infinitely intense pumping, i.e., as $\\rho(\\nu) \\to \\infty$?\n\nA. $1$\n\nB. $\\frac{g_1}{g_2}$\n\nC. $\\frac{g_2}{g_1}$\n\nD. $\\frac{g_1 + g_2}{g_1}$\n\nE. $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is an effective temperature of the radiation.", "solution": "To solve this problem, we must analyze the rates of transitions between the two energy levels and find the steady-state condition. The population of the excited state, $N_2$, increases due to absorption of photons from the pumping field and decreases due to spontaneous and stimulated emission.\n\nThe rate of upward transitions (absorption) from level 1 to level 2 is proportional to the population of the ground state $N_1$ and the spectral energy density of the radiation field $\\rho(\\nu)$. The rate is given by:\n$$R_{1 \\to 2} = N_1 B_{12} \\rho(\\nu)$$\n\nThe rate of downward transitions from level 2 to level 1 has two components. The first is spontaneous emission, which occurs at a rate independent of the radiation field. The second is stimulated emission, which is proportional to both the population of the excited state $N_2$ and the spectral energy density $\\rho(\\nu)$. The total downward rate is:\n$$R_{2 \\to 1} = N_2 A_{21} + N_2 B_{21} \\rho(\\nu) = N_2 \\left( A_{21} + B_{21} \\rho(\\nu) \\right)$$\n\nThe net rate of change of the population of the excited state, $N_2$, is the difference between the upward and downward transition rates:\n$$\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = R_{1 \\to 2} - R_{2 \\to 1} = N_1 B_{12} \\rho(\\nu) - N_2 \\left( A_{21} + B_{21} \\rho(\\nu) \\right)$$\n\nIn the steady state, the populations are constant, which means their time derivatives are zero.

We evaluate the limit of our expression for the population ratio:\n$$\\lim_{\\rho(\\nu) \\to \\infty} \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\lim_{\\rho(\\nu) \\to \\infty} \\frac{B_{12} \\rho(\\nu)}{A_{21} + B_{21} \\rho(\\nu)}$$\n\nTo evaluate this limit, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by $\\rho(\\nu)$:\n$$\\lim_{\\rho(\\nu) \\to \\infty} \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\lim_{\\rho(\\nu) \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{B_{12} \\rho(\\nu)}{\\rho(\\nu)}}{\\frac{A_{21}}{\\rho(\\nu)} + \\frac{B_{21} \\rho(\\nu)}{\\rho(\\nu)}} = \\lim_{\\rho(\\nu) \\to \\infty} \\frac{B_{12}}{\\frac{A_{21}}{\\rho(\\nu)} + B_{21}}$$\n\nAs $\\rho(\\nu) \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{A_{21}}{\\rho(\\nu)}$ approaches zero. This is physically intuitive: at very high intensities, the rate of stimulated emission completely dominates the rate of spontaneous emission. The limit becomes:\n$$\\lim_{\\rho(\\nu) \\to \\infty} \\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{B_{12}}{0 + B_{21}} = \\frac{B_{12}}{B_{21}}$$\n\nFinally, we use the relationship between the Einstein B coefficients provided in the problem statement: $g_1 B_{12} = g_2 B_{21}$. From this, we find the ratio:\n$$\\frac{B_{12}}{B_{21}} = \\frac{g_2}{g_1}$$\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible population ratio in the limit of infinite pump intensity is $\\frac{g_2}{g_1}$.
