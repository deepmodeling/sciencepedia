The parity of a multi-electron atomic state is a quantum mechanical property that describes its behavior under spatial inversion (a transformation that flips the sign of all spatial coordinates, $\\vec{r} \\to -\\vec{r}$). The parity $P$ is determined by the sum of the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers ($l_i$) of the electrons, according to the formula $P = (-1)^{\\sum_i l_i}$. A state is said to have \"even\" parity if $P=+1$ and \"odd\" parity if $P=-1$.\n\nElectric dipole (E1) transitions are the most common type of radiative transitions in atoms. A key selection rule for an E1 transition to occur between an initial and a final state is Laporte's rule, which has two components:\n1. The parity of the atomic state must change (i.e., a transition between a state of even parity and a state of odd parity).\n2. For the single electron undergoing the transition, its orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ must change by one unit, i.e., $\\Delta l = \\pm 1$.\n\nGiven this information, analyze a transition from an electronic state arising from the $nd \\ n'd$ configuration to a state arising from the $nd \\ n'p$ configuration.
