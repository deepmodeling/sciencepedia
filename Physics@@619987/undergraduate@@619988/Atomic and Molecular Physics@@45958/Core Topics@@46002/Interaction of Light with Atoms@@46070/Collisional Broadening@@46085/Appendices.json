To limit the mean free path and confine the A-atoms, the cell is filled with a much more abundant, inert \"B-atom\" buffer gas of mass $m_B$. The entire gas mixture is maintained in thermal equilibrium at a constant absolute temperature $T$.\n\nThe A-atoms are excited by a laser to a specific state which has a natural lifetime $\\tau_{nat}$ before it decays via spontaneous emission. This finite lifetime results in the natural broadening of the observed spectral line. Concurrently, collisions between the excited A-atoms and the ground-state B-atoms interrupt the quantum phase of the emission process, leading to an additional broadening of the spectral line, known as collisional or pressure broadening. The magnitude of both broadening effects is typically characterized by their respective contributions to the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the spectral line's intensity profile when measured in terms of angular frequency.\n\nAssuming the gas is dilute enough to be treated as an ideal gas and that Doppler broadening is negligible, derive an expression for the pressure $P$ of the buffer gas at which the collisional broadening FWHM becomes exactly equal to the natural broadening FWHM. Your answer should be expressed in terms of the natural lifetime $\\tau_{nat}$, the effective collision cross-section $\\sigma$ between an A-atom and a B-atom, the atomic masses $m_A$ and $m_B$, the temperature $T$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$.", "solution": "The natural broadening arises from the finite lifetime of the excited state.
