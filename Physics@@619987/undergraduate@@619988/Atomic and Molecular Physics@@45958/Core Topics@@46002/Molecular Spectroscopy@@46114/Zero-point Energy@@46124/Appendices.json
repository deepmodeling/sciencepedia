We can solve this in two equivalent ways: by calculating the change in the system's energy, or by integrating the force exerted on the moving wall.\n\n**Method 1: Change in Energy**\n\nFor an isolated quantum system undergoing a quasi-static (adiabatic) process, there is no heat exchange with the environment. According to the first law of thermodynamics, the work done *on* the system, $W$, must equal the change in its internal energy, $\\Delta E$.\n$$W = \\Delta E = E_{\\text{final}} - E_{\\text{initial}}$$\nThe energy eigenvalues for a particle of mass $m$ in a 1D infinite square well of width $a$ are given by:\n$$E_n(a) = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m a^2}$$\nThe problem states that the particle is always in the ground state, which corresponds to the principal quantum number $n=1$. Therefore, the energy of the particle when the well has a width $a$ is:\n$$E(a) = E_1(a) = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m a^2}$$\nThis is the zero-point energy of the system.\n\nThe initial state of the system corresponds to a well of width $a_{\\text{initial}} = L$. The initial energy is:\n$$E_{\\text{initial}} = E(L) = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m L^2}$$\nThe final state of the system corresponds to a well of width $a_{\\text{final}} = 2L$. The final energy is:\n$$E_{\\text{final}} = E(2L) = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m (2L)^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{8 m L^2}$$\nNow, we can calculate the work done on the particle:\n$$W = E_{\\text{final}} - E_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{8 m L^2} - \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m L^2}$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$W = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{8 m L^2} - \\frac{4\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{8 m L^2} = -\\frac{3\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{8 m L^2}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the system does work on its surroundings, which is expected since the particle's energy decreases as the well expands.\n\n**Method 2: Integrating the Quantum Mechanical Force**\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the work by integrating the force. The work done *on* the particle is the negative of the work done *by* the particle on the moving wall. The work done by the particle, $W_{\\text{by}}$, is given by the integral of the force it exerts, $F$, over the displacement of the wall.\n$$W_{\\text{by}} = \\int_{L}^{2L} F(a) \\, da$$\nThe generalized force exerted by the particle on the wall is related to the change in its energy with respect to the wall's position, $a$:\n$$F(a) = -\\frac{dE(a)}{da}$$\nLet's compute this force for the ground state:\n$$F(a) = -\\frac{d}{da} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m a^2} \\right) = -\\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 m} \\right) \\left( -2a^{-3} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{m a^3}$$\nThe force is positive, indicating that the particle pushes the wall outward.\n\nNow, we integrate this force from the initial width $L$ to the final width $2L$ to find the work done *by* the particle:\n$$W_{\\text{by}} = \\int_{L}^{2L} \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{m a^3} \\, da = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{m} \\int_{L}^{2L} a^{-3} \\, da$$\n$$W_{\\text{by}} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{m} \\left[ \\frac{a^{-2}}{-2} \\right]_{L}^{2L} = -\\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m} \\left[ \\frac{1}{a^2} \\right]_{L}^{2L}$$\n$$W_{\\text{by}} = -\\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{1}{(2L)^2} - \\frac{1}{L^2} \\right) = -\\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{1}{4L^2} - \\frac{4}{4L^2} \\right)$$\n$$W_{\\text{by}} = -\\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( -\\frac{3}{4L^2} \\right) = \\frac{3\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{8 m L^2}$$\nThe work done *on* the particle, $W$, is the negative of the work done *by* the particle:\n$$W = -W_{\\text{by}} = -\\frac{3\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{8 m L^2}$$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming our calculation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{3 \\pi^{2} \\hbar^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}}$$", "id": "2049438"}]}
