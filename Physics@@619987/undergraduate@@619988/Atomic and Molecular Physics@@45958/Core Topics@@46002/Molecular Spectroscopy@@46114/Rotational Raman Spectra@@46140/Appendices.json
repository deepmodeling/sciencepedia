In rotational Raman spectroscopy, a sample is irradiated with monochromatic light. The incident photons can scatter inelastically from the molecules, causing them to transition between different rotational levels. A 'Stokes line' in the resulting spectrum corresponds to a process where the scattered photon has a lower energy than the incident photon. The energy lost by the photon is absorbed by the molecule, promoting it to a higher rotational energy level.\n\nAn experimentalist studying a particular diatomic molecule observes a distinct Stokes line that corresponds to an energy absorption of $\\Delta E = 26B$.

We will solve this by determining the relationship between the rotational constant and the spacing of spectral lines.\n\nFirst, let's establish the energy levels of a rigid diatomic rotor. The rotational energy levels are quantized and given by the expression $E_J = h c B J(J+1)$, where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $B$ is the rotational constant in units of cm$^{-1}$ (as requested), and $J$ is the rotational quantum number ($J = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$). The quantity $F(J) = E_J/(hc) = B J(J+1)$ is the rotational term value, expressed in wavenumbers (cm$^{-1}$).\n\nNext, we consider the selection rules for pure rotational Raman scattering for a linear molecule like N$_2$. For a transition to be Raman-active, there must be a change in the polarizability of the molecule during rotation. The selection rule for pure rotational Raman scattering is $\\Delta J = J_{\\text{final}} - J_{\\text{initial}} = \\pm 2$. Transitions with $\\Delta J = 0$ correspond to Rayleigh scattering, where the photon energy does not change.\n\nThe problem specifies that the observed lines are Stokes lines. Stokes lines correspond to inelastic scattering where the molecule is excited to a higher rotational energy level, and the scattered photon consequently has lower energy. This corresponds to the selection rule $\\Delta J = +2$. A molecule in an initial state with quantum number $J$ transitions to a final state with quantum number $J+2$.\n\nThe change in the molecule's rotational energy, $\\Delta E_{\\text{rot}}$, for such a transition is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\text{rot}} = E_{J+2} - E_J\n$$\nIn terms of term values (in cm$^{-1}$), this energy change corresponds to a wavenumber shift $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} = F(J+2) - F(J) = B(J+2)(J+3) - B J(J+1)\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} = B [ (J^2 + 5J + 6) - (J^2 + J) ]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} = B(4J + 6)\n$$\nThis value, $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}$, represents the energy (in wavenumbers) that the molecule absorbs from the incident photon. Therefore, the wavenumber of the scattered Stokes photon, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{S,J}$, originating from an initial level $J$, is:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_{S,J} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{0} - \\Delta\\tilde{\\nu} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{0} - B(4J+6)\n$$\nThe problem states that two *adjacent* Stokes lines are observed. These lines must arise from transitions starting from adjacent initial rotational levels, say $J$ and $J+1$. Let the line at the higher wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_1$ correspond to the transition from initial level $J$, and the line at the lower wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}_2$ correspond to the transition from initial level $J+1$. (A higher initial J leads to a larger energy shift and thus a lower final photon wavenumber).\n\nSo we have:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_1 = \\tilde{\\nu}_{S,J} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{0} - B(4J+6)\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{\\nu}_2 = \\tilde{\\nu}_{S,J+1} = \\tilde{\\nu}_{0} - B(4(J+1)+6) = \\tilde{\\nu}_{0} - B(4J+10)\n$$\nThe separation in wavenumber between these two adjacent Stokes lines, $\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{sep}}$, is the difference between their wavenumbers:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{sep}} = \\tilde{\\nu}_1 - \\tilde{\\nu}_2 = [\\tilde{\\nu}_{0} - B(4J+6)] - [\\tilde{\\nu}_{0} - B(4J+10)]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{sep}} = -B(4J+6) + B(4J+10) = B(-4J - 6 + 4J + 10)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\text{sep}} = 4B\n$$\nThis is a key result: the separation between adjacent lines in a pure rotational Raman spectrum is constant and equal to $4B$.
