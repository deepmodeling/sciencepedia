The principle states that an electronic transition is most likely to occur without changes in the positions of the nuclei in the molecular entity. The probability of a transition between the vibrational level $v''$ of the initial electronic state and the vibrational level $v'$ of the final electronic state is proportional to the Franck-Condon factor, $q_{v'v''}$. This factor is defined as the square of the overlap integral of the corresponding vibrational wavefunctions, $\\psi_{v''}$ and $\\psi_{v'}$:\n\n$$q_{v'v''} = \\left| \\int \\psi_{v'}^{*}(R) \\psi_{v''}(R) dR \\right|^{2}$$\n\nHere, $R$ is the internuclear distance.

For real vibrational wavefunctions, this implies they have essentially the same shape and are centered at the same internuclear distance.\n\nTherefore, a Franck-Condon factor very close to $1$ means the overlap integral has magnitude very close to $1$, which physically requires that $\\psi_{v'}$ and $\\psi_{v''}$ nearly coincide in shape and center. This does not require that the entire potential energy curves be identical; it suffices that the local regions sampled by these vibrational states (e.g., around their turning points and equilibrium) be nearly the same. It also does not require the transition to be from $v''=0$ to $v'=0$; any pair $(v',v'')$ can yield a large overlap if the corresponding wavefunctions match closely.

This statement is incorrect. The wavefunction for $v=0$ is an even function, and the wavefunction for $v=2$ is also an even function. The product of two even functions is an even function. The integral of a non-zero even function over a symmetric interval (like $(-\\infty, \\infty)$) is generally non-zero, not zero. For example, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-2x^2) dx \\neq 0$. This option incorrectly states the mathematical property of integrals of even functions.\n\nB. This statement confuses two different types of transitions. The selection rule $\\Delta v = \\pm 1$ applies to transitions *within a single electronic state* induced by the absorption or emission of an infrared photon (vibrational spectroscopy). The Franck-Condon principle, however, governs the vibrational-level intensities of *electronic* transitions (e.g., induced by a UV-Visible photon). In electronic transitions, $\\Delta v$ can be any integer, with the probability governed by the overlap integral. So, while $\\Delta v = 2$ is forbidden for pure vibrational spectroscopy, it is not fundamentally forbidden for a vibronic transition. The reason for $q_{0,2}=0$ is more specific to the setup.\n\nC. This statement is the correct explanation. As derived above, since the potential wells are identical, the wavefunctions $\\psi_0$ and $\\psi_2$ are two distinct eigenfunctions of the same Hamiltonian operator. The orthogonality of such eigenfunctions is a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics, leading directly to a zero overlap integral.\n\nD. This statement misinterprets the Franck-Condon principle. The principle states that electronic transitions happen so quickly that the nuclei do not have time to move significantly. This is why the transition is represented as a \"vertical\" line on a potential energy diagram. It does not forbid transitions to final states that would correspond to a different average internuclear distance; it merely states that the probability of such a transition depends on the wavefunction overlap at the initial nuclear configuration. For identical, undisplaced potentials, a vertical transition doesn't involve any change in the equilibrium R, but the wavefunctions $\\psi_v$ are not localized at a single R value. The integral being zero is a consequence of wavefunction shape and orthogonality, not a classical prohibition of movement.\n\nTherefore, the only correct and complete physical reason is the mathematical orthogonality of the wavefunctions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1993648"}, {"introduction": "Real molecules often have electronic states with different potential energy curve shapes, even if their equilibrium positions are similar. This practice moves beyond the idealized case of identical potentials and challenges you to use a more general principle—wavefunction symmetry—to predict transition intensities.
