The rotational terms are given by $F(J) = BJ(J+1)$. Since we assume $B' = B'' = B$, the expressions become $F'(J') = B J'(J'+1)$ and $F''(J'') = B J''(J''+1)$.\n\nWe will analyze each branch separately.\n\n**1. The R-branch ($\\Delta J = +1$)**\nFor the R-branch, the selection rule is $J' - J'' = +1$, which means $J' = J'' + 1$. We can label the lines in the R-branch by the quantum number of the lower state, $J''$. Let's denote $J''$ as $J$ for simplicity ($J = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$). Thus, $J' = J+1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the general formula for the wavenumber, we get the positions of the R-branch lines, $\\bar{\\nu}_R(J)$:\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_R(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + F'(J+1) - F''(J) $$\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_R(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + B(J+1)(J+1+1) - B J(J+1) $$\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_R(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + B(J+1)(J+2) - B J(J+1) $$\nWe can factor out $B(J+1)$:\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_R(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + B(J+1) [(J+2) - J] $$\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_R(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + B(J+1)(2) $$\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_R(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + 2B(J+1) \\quad \\text{for } J = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n\nLet's find the spacing between adjacent lines in the R-branch. The spacing between the line originating from state $J$ and the line from state $J+1$ is:\n$$ \\Delta \\bar{\\nu}_R = \\bar{\\nu}_R(J+1) - \\bar{\\nu}_R(J) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\bar{\\nu}_R = [\\bar{\\nu}_0 + 2B((J+1)+1)] - [\\bar{\\nu}_0 + 2B(J+1)] $$\n$$ \\Delta \\bar{\\nu}_R = [\\bar{\\nu}_0 + 2B(J+2)] - [\\bar{\\nu}_0 + 2B(J+1)] $$\n$$ \\Delta \\bar{\\nu}_R = 2B(J+2) - 2B(J+1) = 2BJ + 4B - 2BJ - 2B = 2B $$\nThe spacing between any two adjacent lines in the R-branch is a constant value of $2B$.\n\n**2. The P-branch ($\\Delta J = -1$)**\nFor the P-branch, the selection rule is $J' - J'' = -1$, which means $J' = J'' - 1$. Let's again denote $J''$ as $J$ for simplicity. Since $J'$ must be non-negative ($J' \\ge 0$), $J''-1 \\ge 0$, which implies $J'' \\ge 1$. So, for the P-branch, $J = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nSubstituting $J' = J-1$ into the general formula, we get the positions of the P-branch lines, $\\bar{\\nu}_P(J)$:\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_P(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + F'(J-1) - F''(J) $$\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_P(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + B(J-1)(J-1+1) - B J(J+1) $$\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_P(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + B(J-1)J - B J(J+1) $$\nWe can factor out $BJ$:\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_P(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + BJ [(J-1) - (J+1)] $$\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_P(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + BJ (-2) $$\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_P(J) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 - 2BJ \\quad \\text{for } J = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\n\nLet's find the spacing between adjacent lines in the P-branch.

The Gap at the Band Origin**\nThe R-branch lines appear at wavenumbers greater than $\\bar{\\nu}_0$, and the P-branch lines appear at wavenumbers less than $\\bar{\\nu}_0$. There is no line at $\\bar{\\nu}_0$ itself because $\\Delta J=0$ (the Q-branch) is forbidden for this type of transition.\n\nThe first line in the R-branch corresponds to $J=0$:\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_R(0) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + 2B(0+1) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 + 2B $$\nThe first line in the P-branch corresponds to $J=1$:\n$$ \\bar{\\nu}_P(1) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 - 2B(1) = \\bar{\\nu}_0 - 2B $$\nThe separation between the first R-branch line and the first P-branch line is the size of the central gap:\n$$ \\text{Gap} = \\bar{\\nu}_R(0) - \\bar{\\nu}_P(1) = (\\bar{\\nu}_0 + 2B) - (\\bar{\\nu}_0 - 2B) = 4B $$\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe spectrum consists of a series of lines on either side of the band origin $\\bar{\\nu}_0$. Both the P and R branches consist of lines that are equally spaced by $2B$. There is a central gap of $4B$ where no lines appear, centered at $\\bar{\\nu}_0$.

This gives rise to two branches:\n1.  The R-branch, where $\\Delta J = +1$, so $J' = J''+1$.\n2.  The P-branch, where $\\Delta J = -1$, so $J' = J''-1$.\n\nTo describe both branches with a single equation, it is convenient to introduce a running number $m$. For the R-branch, we define $m = J''+1$, so $m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ (since $J''=0, 1, 2, \\ldots$). For the P-branch, we define $m = -J''$, so $m = -1, -2, -3, \\ldots$ (since $J''=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$; $J''=0$ is not possible for the P-branch as it would require $J'=-1$).\n\nUsing this definition, we can write $J'' = |m|-1$ for the R-branch and $J'' = -m$ for the P-branch. A single expression can be found by substituting $J' = J'' + \\Delta J$ and noting that $\\Delta J = m/|m|$ (for $m \\neq 0$). A more direct approach is to substitute $J''$ and $J'$ in terms of $m$:\nFor the R-branch ($m>0$): $J''=m-1$ and $J'=m$.\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_R(m) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + B'm(m+1) - B''(m-1)m = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + (B'+B'')m + (B'-B'')m^2 $$\nFor the P-branch ($m<0$): $J''=-m$ and $J'= -m-1$.\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_P(m) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + B'(-m-1)(-m) - B''(-m)(-m+1) $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_P(m) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + B'm(m+1) - B''m(m-1) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + (B'+B'')m + (B'-B'')m^2 $$\nThus, both branches are described by the same quadratic equation, known as the Fortrat parabola:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}(m) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + (B'+B'')m + (B'-B'')m^2 $$\n\nA band head is a point of maximum or minimum frequency in a branch, which corresponds to the vertex of the Fortrat parabola. To find the vertex, we differentiate $\\tilde{\\nu}(m)$ with respect to $m$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\tilde{\\nu}}{dm} = (B'+B'') + 2(B'-B'')m = 0 $$\nSolving for $m$ gives the position of the head, $m_{\\text{head}}$:\n$$ m_{\\text{head}} = - \\frac{B'+B''}{2(B'-B'')} $$\nThe wavenumber of the band head, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{head}$, is the value of $\\tilde{\\nu}(m)$ at $m = m_{\\text{head}}$.

Therefore, $m_{\\text{head}}$ will be negative, which indicates that the band head is formed in the P-branch. A band where the head is at a lower frequency (formed in the P-branch) and the tail degrades to higher frequencies (the R-branch) is said to be \"violet-shaded\" or \"blue-shaded\".\n\nNow, we calculate the frequency shift from the origin to the head:\n$$ \\Delta \\tilde{\\nu}_{head} = - \\frac{(B'+B'')^2}{4(B'-B'')} = - \\frac{(4.54)^2}{4(0.28)} = - \\frac{20.6116}{1.12} \\approx -18.403214 \\text{ cm}^{-1} $$\nIn this calculation, $4.54$ has three significant figures, and $0.28$ has two.
