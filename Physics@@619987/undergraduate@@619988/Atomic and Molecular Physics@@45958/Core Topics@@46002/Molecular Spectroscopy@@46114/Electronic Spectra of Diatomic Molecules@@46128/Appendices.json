For this particular transition, experimental analysis reveals that the bond length in the excited state is shorter than in the ground state, which implies that $B' > B''$.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements correctly describes the appearance of this electronic band?\n\nA.

For a given electronic and vibrational transition, the wavenumbers of the rotational lines are given by:\n$$ \\nu = \\nu_0 + F'(J') - F''(J'') $$\nwhere $\\nu_0$ is the band origin (the wavenumber of the pure vibronic transition without rotation), $F'(J') = B'J'(J'+1)$ is the rotational term value for the upper electronic state, and $F''(J'') = B''J''(J''+1)$ is the rotational term value for the lower electronic state. $J'$ and $J''$ are the rotational quantum numbers for the upper and lower states, respectively.\n\nWe consider the two main branches of the spectrum, the R-branch and the P-branch.\n\nFor the R-branch, the selection rule is $\\Delta J = J' - J'' = +1$. Thus, $J' = J''+1$. Let's use $J$ to denote the rotational quantum number of the lower state, $J''$. So, $J''=J$ and $J'=J+1$. The line positions are:\n$$ \\nu_R(J) = \\nu_0 + B'(J+1)(J+2) - B''J(J+1) \\quad \\text{for } J=0, 1, 2, ... $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\nu_R(J) = \\nu_0 + (B'+B'') (J+1) + (B'-B'') (J+1)^2 $$\n\nFor the P-branch, the selection rule is $\\Delta J = J' - J'' = -1$.

This corresponds to the vertex of the Fortrat parabola, a plot of $\\nu$ versus a running number $m$ (where $m=J+1$ for the R-branch and $m=-J$ for the P-branch). We can find the location of the vertex by treating $J$ as a continuous variable and finding where the derivative of the wavenumber with respect to $J$ is zero.\n\nLet's analyze the R-branch first. We take the derivative of $\\nu_R(J)$ with respect to $J$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\nu_R}{dJ} = (B'+B'') + 2(B'-B'')(J+1) $$\nWe are given that $B' > B''$, which means $B'-B'' > 0$. Also, $B'+B'' > 0$ and $J \\geq 0$. Therefore, every term on the right-hand side is positive. This means $\\frac{d\\nu_R}{dJ}$ is always positive, so the R-branch lines continuously spread out towards higher wavenumbers without forming a head.\n\nNow, let's analyze the P-branch. We take the derivative of $\\nu_P(J)$ with respect to $J$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\nu_P}{dJ} = -(B'+B'') + 2(B'-B'')J $$\nSetting this derivative to zero to find the value of $J$ at the band head ($J_{head}$):\n$$ 2(B'-B'')J_{head} = B'+B'' $$\n$$ J_{head} = \\frac{B'+B''}{2(B'-B'')} $$\nSince we are given $B' > B''$, the denominator $(B'-B'')$ is positive. The numerator $(B'+B'')$ is also positive. Therefore, $J_{head}$ is a positive, physical value. This confirms that a band head forms in the P-branch.\n\nTo determine the direction of degradation, we examine the position of the head and the direction of the tail. The head occurs at $J_{head}$ in the P-branch. The P-branch lines start at $J=1$ and move in the direction of decreasing wavenumber (since for small $J$, the term $-(B'+B'')J$ dominates). They reach a minimum wavenumber at $J_{head}$ (the band head) and then \"turn back\" toward higher wavenumbers for $J > J_{head}$. The R-branch, as we found, always extends to higher wavenumbers.\n\nTherefore, the spectrum has a sharp edge (the head) on the low-wavenumber (red) side, formed by the turning point of the P-branch. Both the remainder of the P-branch and the entire R-branch extend out to higher wavenumbers (the violet side). This appearance, with a sharp red-side edge and a diffuse tail extending to the violet, is called \"degradation to the violet\".\n\nThus, a band head forms in the P-branch, and the band is degraded to the violet.
