Its linear structure possesses a center of inversion, making it an ideal system for observing the rule of mutual exclusion. This first exercise [@problem_id:2038799] asks you to predict the spectroscopic activity of the symmetric carbon-carbon stretch, a vibration where both carbon atoms move in unison. By analyzing this fundamental motion, you will build the core skill of linking a vibration's symmetry to its observability in Infrared and Raman spectra.", "problem": "A molecule of acetylene, which has the chemical formula $C_2H_2$, consists of two hydrogen atoms and two carbon atoms arranged in a straight line, with the structure $H-C\\equiv C-H$. The molecule is symmetric about the midpoint of the carbon-carbon triple bond. We are interested in predicting the spectroscopic activity of a specific vibrational mode: the symmetric carbon-carbon stretch. In this mode, the two carbon atoms oscillate along the molecular axis, moving simultaneously away from or towards the molecule's center of mass. The hydrogen atoms also move along the axis in such a way that the molecule's center of mass remains stationary and its overall linear, symmetric structure is preserved at all points during the vibration.\n\nThe observation of a vibrational mode in a spectrum depends on the following principles:\n1.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**: A mode is \"IR active\" and can be observed in an IR spectrum if the vibration causes a change in the molecule's electric dipole moment.\n2.  **Raman Spectroscopy**: A mode is \"Raman active\" and can be observed in a Raman spectrum if the vibration causes a change in the molecule's polarizability. Polarizability is a measure of how easily the electron cloud of the molecule can be distorted by an external electric field.\n\nBased on these principles and the description of the molecule and its vibration, which of the following statements correctly predicts the spectroscopic activity of the symmetric C-C stretching mode in acetylene?\n\nA. It will appear in the IR spectrum but not in the Raman spectrum.\n\nB. It will appear in the Raman spectrum but not in the IR spectrum.\n\nC. It will appear in both the IR and Raman spectra.\n\nD. It will appear in neither the IR nor the Raman spectra.\n\nE. Its activity is dependent on the temperature and cannot be determined from the information given.", "solution": "We start by identifying the symmetry of the molecule and the vibrational mode. Acetylene is a linear molecule with point group $D_{\\infty h}$, which includes an inversion center at the midpoint of the carbon-carbon bond. The symmetric C–C stretch described is a totally symmetric vibration about the molecular axis that preserves the inversion symmetry; hence its normal coordinate is gerade. In linear-molecule notation, this mode transforms as $\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$.\n\nThe fundamental selection rule for infrared (IR) activity is that a normal mode $Q_{k}$ is IR active if it produces a first-order change in the molecular dipole moment:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q_{k}}\\right)_{0} \\neq 0.\n$$\nUnder inversion $\\hat{i}$, the dipole moment transforms as an odd vector:\n$$\n\\hat{i}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}.\n$$\nTherefore, only ungerade ($u$) vibrational modes can couple to $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and be IR active in a centrosymmetric molecule. Since the symmetric C–C stretch in acetylene is gerade ($g$), it cannot produce a first-order change in $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$, so it is IR inactive:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q_{\\Sigma_{g}^{+}}}\\right)_{0}=0.\n$$\n\nThe selection rule for Raman activity is that a normal mode $Q_{k}$ is Raman active if it produces a first-order change in the polarizability tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}{\\partial Q_{k}}\\right)_{0} \\neq 0.\n$$\nUnder inversion $\\hat{i}$, the polarizability tensor is even:\n$$\n\\hat{i}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\n$$\nand the quadratic basis functions ($x^{2}$, $y^{2}$, $z^{2}$, $xy$, $xz$, $yz$) are all gerade.

Since the symmetric C–C stretch is $\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$, it is Raman active:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}}{\\partial Q_{\\Sigma_{g}^{+}}}\\right)_{0}\\neq 0.\n$$\n\nThese conclusions are consistent with the mutual exclusion principle for centrosymmetric molecules: modes that are IR active are ungerade and modes that are Raman active are gerade; no mode can be both IR and Raman active. Therefore, the symmetric C–C stretching mode in acetylene is Raman active and IR inactive.\n\nThus, among the provided options, the correct prediction is that it appears in the Raman spectrum but not in the IR spectrum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2038799"}, {"introduction": "Molecular structure is not always static, and a molecule's symmetry can change with its conformation. This next practice explores this dynamic aspect using ethane, $C_2H_6$, as a case study. A simple rotation around the central carbon-carbon bond can convert ethane between its staggered and eclipsed forms, which possess different point group symmetries. This exercise [@problem_id:2038841] challenges you to consider how these conformational differences—specifically, the presence or absence of an inversion center—profoundly alter the expected vibrational spectra, providing a crucial test of your understanding of the rule of mutual exclusion.", "problem": "An experimental chemist is studying the vibrational properties of ethane ($C_{2}H_{6}$). Ethane can exist in two primary rotational conformations (conformers) about the carbon-carbon single bond: the 'staggered' conformation, where the hydrogen atoms on one carbon are positioned in the gaps between the hydrogen atoms on the other carbon when viewed along the C-C bond axis, and the 'eclipsed' conformation, where the hydrogen atoms on the two carbons are aligned.\n\nThe chemist plans to measure the vibrational frequencies using two different techniques: Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, which detects vibrations that cause a change in the molecule's electric dipole moment, and Raman spectroscopy, which detects vibrations that cause a change in the molecule's polarizability.\n\nAssuming the chemist could isolate and measure the spectra for a pure sample of each conformer at low temperature, which of the following statements most accurately predicts the relationship between the active vibrational bands in the IR and Raman spectra for the two conformers?\n\nA. For both staggered and eclipsed ethane, any vibrational band that is active in the IR spectrum will also be active in the Raman spectrum.\n\nB. For an idealized staggered ethane molecule, there will be no vibrational bands that are active in both the IR and Raman spectra. For an idealized eclipsed ethane molecule, some vibrational bands can be active in both spectra.\n\nC. For an idealized eclipsed ethane molecule, there will be no vibrational bands that are active in both the IR and Raman spectra. For an idealized staggered ethane molecule, some vibrational bands can be active in both spectra.\n\nD. For both idealized staggered and eclipsed ethane molecules, there will be no vibrational bands that are active in both the IR and Raman spectra.\n\nE. The spectra of the two conformers will be identical, as they have the same chemical formula and connectivity. Both will have some vibrational bands that are active in IR, some in Raman, and some in both.", "solution": "We identify the idealized point-group symmetries of the two conformers. Staggered ethane has $D_{3d}$ symmetry, which is centrosymmetric (contains an inversion center). Eclipsed ethane has $D_{3h}$ symmetry, which is non-centrosymmetric (no inversion center).\n\nThe group-theoretical selection rules for vibrational activity are:\n- A normal mode is IR active if it transforms as the components of the dipole moment vector $(x,y,z)$.\n- A normal mode is Raman active if it transforms as the components of the polarizability tensor, i.e., as quadratic forms such as $x^{2}$, $y^{2}$, $z^{2}$, $xy$, $xz$, $yz$.\n\nFor a centrosymmetric point group, the mutual exclusion rule applies: irreducible representations split into gerade ($g$) and ungerade ($u$) based on inversion parity. The dipole vector components $(x,y,z)$ are ungerade, while the quadratic forms are gerade. Therefore, in any centrosymmetric point group, IR-active modes must be of $u$ symmetry and Raman-active modes must be of $g$ symmetry; a single mode cannot be both.\n\nApply this to staggered ethane ($D_{3d}$):\n- The vector components transform as $A_{2u}$ for $z$ and $E_{u}$ for $(x,y)$, so IR-active modes must be $u$.\n- The quadratic forms transform as $A_{1g}$, $E_{g}$, etc., so Raman-active modes must be $g$.\nThus, by the mutual exclusion rule in $D_{3d}$, no vibrational band can be simultaneously IR and Raman active.\n\nApply this to eclipsed ethane ($D_{3h}$):\n- The vector components transform as $A_{2}''$ for $z$ and $E'$ for $(x,y)$, so IR-active irreducible representations include $A_{2}''$ and $E'$.\n- The quadratic forms include $x^{2}+y^{2}, z^{2}$ transforming as $A_{1}'$, $(x^{2}-y^{2}, xy)$ as $E'$, and $(xz, yz)$ as $E''$, so Raman-active irreducible representations include $A_{1}'$, $E'$, and $E''$.\nSince $E'$ appears in both the IR-active set and the Raman-active set in $D_{3h}$, some vibrational modes can be simultaneously IR and Raman active in the eclipsed conformer.\n\nTherefore, for idealized staggered ethane ($D_{3d}$) there are no bands active in both IR and Raman, whereas for idealized eclipsed ethane ($D_{3h}$) some bands are active in both.

By interpreting the spectral evidence—specifically, the overlap (or lack thereof) between IR and Raman bands—you can definitively identify the molecular structure, demonstrating the rule's immense practical value in chemical synthesis and characterization.", "problem": "A chemist is working to synthesize a specific isomer of a planar, disubstituted benzene compound with the formula $\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_4\\text{X}_2$, where `X` represents a single atom. Two possible isomers are the primary candidates for the reaction product: the *ortho*-isomer (1,2-disubstituted) and the *para*-isomer (1,4-disubstituted). To determine the identity of the synthesized compound, the chemist performs vibrational spectroscopy. The resulting data from both Infrared Radiation (IR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy reveal several strong vibrational bands present at identical frequencies in both spectra.\n\nGiven the rule of mutual exclusion, which states that for any molecule possessing a center of inversion (i.e., is centrosymmetric), no vibrational mode can be simultaneously active in both IR and Raman spectroscopy, which of the following statements represents the most valid conclusion?\n\nA.

It is impossible to distinguish between the two isomers using this spectroscopic information alone.", "solution": "We use vibrational selection rules. An IR-active normal mode requires a change in the molecular dipole moment, while a Raman-active normal mode requires a change in the molecular polarizability. For molecules that possess a center of inversion $i$ (are centrosymmetric), the mutual exclusion rule applies: normal modes are either gerade ($g$) or ungerade ($u$) under inversion, with IR-active modes being $u$ and Raman-active modes being $g$. Therefore, in any centrosymmetric molecule, no single vibrational mode can be simultaneously IR and Raman active; equivalently, there can be no coincident bands corresponding to the same normal mode in both spectra.\n\nThe observation given is that several strong vibrational bands occur at identical frequencies in both IR and Raman spectra, implying the same normal modes are active in both techniques. This observation is incompatible with the presence of an inversion center. Hence, the molecule is non-centrosymmetric.\n\nFor the two candidate isomers with identical substituents $X$: the para-1,4-disubstituted isomer has point group $D_{2h}$ and possesses an inversion center, so it must obey mutual exclusion and would not show coincident IR/Raman bands for the same modes. The ortho-1,2-disubstituted isomer has point group $C_{2v}$, which lacks an inversion center, so coincident IR/Raman activity for the same modes is allowed. Therefore, the data support the ortho isomer.\n\nThus, the correct choice is that the compound is the ortho-isomer because it lacks a center of inversion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2038822"}]}
