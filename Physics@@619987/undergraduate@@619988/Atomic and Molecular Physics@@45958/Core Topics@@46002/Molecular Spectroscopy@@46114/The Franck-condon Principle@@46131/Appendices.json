The molecule is initially in its ground electronic state and its lowest vibrational energy level, denoted by the vibrational quantum number $v''=0$. The equilibrium internuclear distance for this ground electronic state is $R_e''$. Upon absorbing a photon, the molecule is promoted to an excited electronic state, which has an equilibrium internuclear distance of $R_e'$. It is observed that the excited state is significantly less strongly bound, resulting in an equilibrium internuclear distance $R_e'$ that is substantially longer than that of the ground state, i.e., $R_e' \\gg R_e''$.\n\nBased on the Franck-Condon principle, which of the following statements best describes the expected vibrational fine structure of the absorption spectrum for the electronic transition, where $v'$ denotes the vibrational quantum number of the excited electronic state?\n\nA. The spectrum will show a series of vibrational peaks, with the transition from $v''=0$ to $v'=0$ (the 0-0 transition) being the most intense. The intensity of subsequent peaks for transitions to $v'=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ will decrease rapidly.\n\nB. Only a single, sharp absorption line corresponding to the $v''=0 \\to v'=0$ transition will be observed, as all other vibrational transitions are forbidden.\n\nC. The spectrum will exhibit a broad progression of vibrational peaks.

The transitions to all accessible excited vibrational levels ($v'=0, 1, 2, \\ldots$) will have approximately equal intensity, resulting in a flat, comb-like spectrum.\n\nE. No absorption spectrum will be observed, because the large change in equilibrium bond length makes the electronic transition forbidden by selection rules.", "solution": "We begin with the Franck-Condon principle and the Condon approximation. The electronic transition dipole is taken to be independent of internuclear distance, so the relative intensities of vibronic lines are governed by Franck-Condon factors, which are the squared overlaps of vibrational wavefunctions on the two electronic potential energy curves:\n$$\nI_{v^{\\prime}v^{\\prime\\prime}} \\propto \\left|\\int \\psi_{v^{\\prime}}^{\\prime}(R)\\,\\psi_{v^{\\prime\\prime}}^{\\prime\\prime}(R)\\,dR\\right|^{2}.\n$$\nFor the given transition, the molecule starts in $v^{\\prime\\prime}=0$ at $R \\approx R_{e}^{\\prime\\prime}$. According to the Franck-Condon principle, the nuclei do not move appreciably during the electronic transition, so the transition is vertical (fixed $R$). Because the excited state has $R_{e}^{\\prime} \\gg R_{e}^{\\prime\\prime}$ and is less strongly bound, the point $R=R_{e}^{\\prime\\prime}$ lies far to the left of the minimum of the excited-state potential. Therefore, a vertical excitation from $R \\approx R_{e}^{\\prime\\prime}$ will land high on the repulsive side of the excited-state potential; the corresponding excited-state vibrational wavefunctions with significant amplitude at $R_{e}^{\\prime\\prime}$ are those with relatively large $v^{\\prime}$.\n\nTo make this quantitative, approximate both electronic potentials as harmonic near their minima and suppose, for clarity, that their curvatures are similar (the equal-frequency approximation with frequency $\\omega$ and reduced mass $\\mu$).

When $R_{e}^{\\prime} \\gg R_{e}^{\\prime\\prime}$, one has $\\Delta R$ large, hence $S \\gg 1$. Consequently:\n- The $0$-$0$ transition ($v^{\\prime}=0$) has very small intensity, $q_{00}=\\exp(-S)$.\n- There is a broad progression of lines with maximum intensity at a vibrational level $v^{\\prime} > 0$, near $v^{\\prime} \\approx S$, and significant intensity spread over many $v^{\\prime}$.\n\nThese features match the qualitative prediction from the vertical-transition picture: at $R=R_{e}^{\\prime\\prime}$, the excited-state wavefunction amplitude is largest for vibrational levels whose classical turning points encompass this displaced geometry, which are higher $v^{\\prime}$ levels.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option A is incorrect because when the displacement is large, the $0$-$0$ line is not the most intense; intensity does not rapidly decrease from $v^{\\prime}=0$.\n- Option B is incorrect because many $v^{\\prime}$ levels are Franck-Condon allowed; they are not forbidden.\n- Option D is incorrect because Franck-Condon factors are not equal across $v^{\\prime}$; they follow a peaked distribution.\n- Option E is incorrect because a large change in equilibrium bond length does not make the electronic transition forbidden; it redistributes vibrational intensities.\n\nThe correct description is a broad progression with a weak $0$-$0$ line and a maximum at $v^{\\prime}>0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2011650"}, {"introduction": "After learning to predict a spectrum from a known structural change, an equally important scientific skill is to work in reverse by interpreting experimental data.

It is found that the vast majority of the molecules are initially in the ground vibrational state ($v''=0$) of the ground electronic state.

The absorption intensity for a vibronic transition from an initial vibrational level $v''$ in the lower electronic potential to a final vibrational level $v'$ in the upper electronic potential is proportional to\n$$\nI_{v'v''} \\propto |\\langle \\chi_{v'}'(R) | \\chi_{v''}''(R) \\rangle|^{2}\\,|\\mu_{el}|^{2},\n$$\nwhere $\\chi_{v''}''(R)$ and $\\chi_{v'}'(R)$ are the vibrational wavefunctions on the lower and upper electronic potentials, and $\\mu_{el}$ is the (approximately $R$-independent) electronic transition dipole moment. Thus, the relative intensities are governed by Franck-Condon (FC) factors,\n$$\nq_{v'v''} = |\\langle \\chi_{v'}'(R) | \\chi_{v''}''(R) \\rangle|^{2}.\n$$\n\nBy the Franck-Condon principle, electronic transitions are vertical in $R$ (nuclei are effectively stationary during the fast electronic transition), so the observed $v'$ distribution reflects the overlap between the initial vibrational wavefunction, localized near the ground-state equilibrium distance $R_{e}''$, and the vibrational eigenfunctions of the excited electronic state, centered near its equilibrium distance $R_{e}'$.\n\nAssume the harmonic approximation for both electronic states and model the two potentials as displaced harmonic oscillators with the same normal coordinate mass and curvature parameters for simplicity. Define the displacement $\\Delta R = R_{e}' - R_{e}''$ and the Huang-Rhys factor\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\mu \\omega'}{2\\hbar}\\,(\\Delta R)^{2},\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the reduced mass and $\\omega'$ is the harmonic frequency of the excited state (an analogous expression holds if one uses the normal coordinate with identical curvatures; the key point is $S \\propto (\\Delta R)^{2}$). In this displaced harmonic-oscillator model, for initial $v''=0$, the FC factors follow a Poisson-like distribution:\n$\nq_{v'0} \\propto \\exp(-S)\\,\\frac{S^{v'}}{v'!}.\n$\nHence,\n$$\nq_{00} \\propto \\exp(-S),\\quad q_{10} \\propto \\exp(-S)\\,S,\\quad q_{20} \\propto \\exp(-S)\\,\\frac{S^{2}}{2}.\n$$\nThe distribution peaks near $v' \\approx S$.

This is consistent with $S \\approx 1$ to $2$, which in turn requires a significant displacement $\\Delta R \\neq 0$, i.e., $R_{e}'$ significantly different from $R_{e}''$.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- A. $R_{e}'$ significantly different from $R_{e}''$: This directly accounts for a nonzero $S$ that shifts intensity from $v'=0$ to $v'=1,2$, matching the observation.\n- B. $R_{e}' \\approx R_{e}''$: This would give $S \\approx 0$ and a strong $0$-$0$ band, contrary to the observation.\n- C. Unbound excited state: This would yield a continuum rather than intense discrete $v'$ lines; it does not match the observed strong $v'=1,2$ lines.\n- D. Much smaller $\\omega'$ but identical $R_{e}$: With no displacement, the $0$-$0$ overlap remains large; frequency differences alone do not suppress $q_{00}$ to be extremely weak.\n- E. Selection rules forbid $v''=0 \\to v'=0$: There is no general vibronic selection rule forbidding $0$-$0$; suppression arises from FC overlap, not selection-rule prohibition.\n\nTherefore, the correct explanation is that the equilibrium internuclear distances are significantly different, consistent with option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2031438"}, {"introduction": "Spectra are not just shaped by molecular geometry but also by experimental conditions like temperature.
