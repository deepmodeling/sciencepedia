The frequency is to be expressed in wavenumbers ($\\text{cm}^{-1}$).\n\nThe fundamental principle of Raman spectroscopy is the inelastic scattering of light. In Stokes scattering, an incident photon loses a quantum of energy to a vibrational mode of the molecule or crystal, and the scattered photon emerges with lower energy, and thus a longer wavelength.\n\nThe energy of a photon is given by the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $\\nu$ is the frequency, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength.\n\nThe energy of the incident photon is:\n$$E_{inc} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{inc}}$$\n\nThe energy of the scattered photon is:\n$$E_{scat} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{scat}}$$\n\nBy conservation of energy, the energy difference between the incident and scattered photons is equal to the energy of the vibrational mode, $\\Delta E_{vib}$:\n$$\\Delta E_{vib} = E_{inc} - E_{scat}$$\n$$\\Delta E_{vib} = hc \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{inc}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{scat}} \\right)$$\n\nThe energy of a vibrational mode is also commonly expressed in terms of wavenumbers, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, which represents the number of waves per unit length (typically in $\\text{cm}^{-1}$). The relationship between energy and wavenumber is:\n$$\\Delta E_{vib} = hc\\tilde{\\nu}$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\Delta E_{vib}$, we get:\n$$hc\\tilde{\\nu} = hc \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{inc}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{scat}} \\right)$$\n\nWe can cancel the term $hc$ from both sides of the equation. This conveniently shows that the vibrational frequency in wavenumbers (the Raman shift) is simply the difference between the wavenumbers of the incident and scattered light:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{inc}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{scat}}$$\n\nTo calculate $\\tilde{\\nu}$ in the required units of $\\text{cm}^{-1}$, we must first convert the given wavelengths from nanometers (nm) to centimeters (cm).\nThe conversion factor is $1 \\text{ nm} = 10^{-7} \\text{ cm}$.\n\nGiven wavelengths:\n$\\lambda_{inc} = 532 \\text{ nm} = 532 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ cm}$\n$\\lambda_{scat} = 548 \\text{ nm} = 548 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ cm}$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into our equation for $\\tilde{\\nu}$:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{532 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ cm}} - \\frac{1}{548 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ cm}}$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\left( \\frac{1}{532} - \\frac{1}{548} \\right) \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nTo evaluate the expression in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\left( \\frac{548 - 532}{532 \\times 548} \\right) \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} = \\left( \\frac{16}{291536} \\right) \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nNow we perform the division:\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx (5.488109 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 548.8109\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\tilde{\\nu} \\approx 548.8\\ \\text{cm}^{-1}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{548.8}$$", "id": "1390020"}, {"introduction": "The position of a Raman peak acts as a molecular fingerprint, sensitive to the molecule's mass and the stiffness of its chemical bonds.
