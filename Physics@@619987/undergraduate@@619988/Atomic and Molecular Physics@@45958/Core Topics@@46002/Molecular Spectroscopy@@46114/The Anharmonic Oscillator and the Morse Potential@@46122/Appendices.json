This is Correct.\n\n- Option B: It claims that tiny $D_e$ implies a broad, flat-bottomed well with small curvature, requiring small $a$ and small $k$. This ignores the constraint that $k$ is fixed; under that constraint, $a$ cannot be small if $D_e$ is tiny. Moreover, for the Morse form, small $a$ would indeed reduce $k$, contradicting the premise. This is Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: It states the well must be deep and narrow, linking narrowness to small $D_e$ at fixed $k$. The depth is set by $D_e$, so a small $D_e$ cannot produce a deep well. Narrowness arises from large $a$, but that does not reverse the small depth. This is Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: It claims the potential is effectively harmonic and symmetric about $r_e$ regardless of $D_e$ when $k$ is fixed. The Morse potential is intrinsically anharmonic and asymmetric; changing $D_e$ (and thus $a$ to keep $k$ fixed) alters the width and the range over which harmonic behavior holds.
