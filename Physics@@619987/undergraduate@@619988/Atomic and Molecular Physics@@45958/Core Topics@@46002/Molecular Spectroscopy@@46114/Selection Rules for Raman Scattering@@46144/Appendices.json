The fundamental requirement for a molecule to be rotationally Raman-active is that its polarizability must be anisotropic. Polarizability, denoted by $\\alpha$, describes the ease with which the electron cloud of a molecule can be distorted by an external electric field. If this polarizability is the same in all directions, it is called isotropic; if it differs along different molecular axes, it is called anisotropic.\n\nA class of molecules known as \"spherical tops,\" such as methane ($\\text{CH}_4$) and sulfur hexafluoride ($\\text{SF}_6$), possesses such high symmetry (e.g., tetrahedral or octahedral) that their polarizability is perfectly isotropic. Despite having rotational energy levels, these molecules are observed to be inactive in pure rotational Raman spectroscopy, meaning they do not produce a pure rotational Raman spectrum.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical reason for this observation?\n\nA. The polarizability of the molecule is the same regardless of its orientation, so rotation does not lead to a change in polarizability from the perspective of a fixed observer.\nB. The molecule lacks a permanent electric dipole moment, which is a necessary condition for any interaction with electromagnetic radiation.\nC. The high symmetry of a spherical top molecule completely freezes out all rotational motion, so there are no rotational transitions to observe.\nD. Rotational Raman transitions require a change in the moment of inertia during rotation, which is impossible for a rigid spherical top.\nE. The incident photons from the laser source do not have enough energy to excite the rotational states of heavy spherical top molecules.", "solution": "Raman scattering arises from the interaction of an oscillating electric field $\\mathbf{E}(t)$ with the induced dipole moment of a molecule, given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}(t) = \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}(t),\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is the molecular polarizability tensor. For rotational Raman scattering, the key physical requirement is that the polarizability tensor in the laboratory frame be modulated in time by the molecular rotation. This modulation produces frequency-shifted scattered light corresponding to rotational energy differences.\n\nThe Raman intensity for rotational transitions depends on the anisotropic part of the polarizability tensor.

As the molecule rotates, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ remains proportional to the identity in any frame, so there is no time-dependent modulation of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ from the perspective of a fixed observer. Consequently, the induced dipole $\\mathbf{p}(t)$ contains only the driving frequency component (Rayleigh scattering), and there are no frequency-shifted components corresponding to pure rotational Raman transitions.\n\nThis directly supports statement A. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n- B is a criterion for pure rotational infrared absorption (which requires a permanent dipole moment), not for Raman scattering, which depends on polarizability anisotropy.\n- C is false because the rotational energy levels of spherical tops exist and are thermally populated; symmetry does not freeze rotation.\n- D is false because rotational Raman activity does not require a change in the moment of inertia during rotation; it requires anisotropy in polarizability.\n- E is false because Raman shifts to rotational lines are determined by molecular energy level differences, and the laser photon energy need not match these differences; the process is inelastic scattering, not absorption.\n\nTherefore, the correct reason is that isotropic polarizability prevents rotational modulation of the induced dipole, eliminating pure rotational Raman lines.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2020569"}, {"introduction": "Once a molecule is identified as rotationally Raman active, its spectrum provides a wealth of structural information.

This practice challenges you to apply this concept to a real-world example, the symmetric stretching mode of carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$), reinforcing your understanding and highlighting how Raman spectroscopy serves as a powerful, complementary tool to infrared spectroscopy for molecular identification [@problem_id:2020623].", "problem": "In vibrational spectroscopy, molecules can be probed using incident light. When light scatters from a molecule, most of it scatters elastically (Rayleigh scattering), with the scattered photons having the same energy as the incident photons. However, a small fraction of light is scattered inelastically, a phenomenon known as Raman scattering. In this process, the scattered photons have gained or lost energy corresponding to the energy of a vibrational transition within the molecule.\n\nA key principle governing this phenomenon is the Raman selection rule, which depends on the molecule's polarizability. Polarizability, denoted by the tensor $\\alpha$, describes the ease with which the electron cloud of a molecule can be distorted by an external electric field, leading to an induced electric dipole moment. The Raman selection rule states that a vibrational mode is \"Raman active\" if and only if the molecular polarizability changes during that vibration.\n\nConsider a carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$) molecule, which has a linear and symmetric O=C=O structure in its equilibrium state. One of its fundamental vibrational modes is the symmetric stretch, where both oxygen atoms move in phase along the molecular axis, either simultaneously away from or towards the central carbon atom.

Inactive, because although the polarizability of each individual carbon-oxygen bond changes, the changes are in opposite directions and cancel each other out, resulting in no change to the molecule's net polarizability.\nD. Active, because the center of symmetry of the molecule is preserved during the vibration.\nE. Inactive, because the molecule's linear geometry is maintained throughout the vibration, so the shape of the polarizability ellipsoid does not change.", "solution": "Raman scattering arises from the oscillation of the induced dipole moment driven by an external electric field. The induced dipole is given by\n$$\n\\mu_{i}^{\\text{ind}}=\\sum_{j}\\alpha_{ij} E_{j},\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_{ij}$ are the components of the molecular polarizability tensor and $E_{j}$ are the components of the applied field.

In the symmetric stretch normal mode $Q_{s}$, the two C=O bonds lengthen and shorten in phase along $z$, preserving linearity and the inversion center. As both bonds elongate (or compress) simultaneously, the ease of electronic distortion along the molecular axis changes coherently; hence $\\alpha_{zz}$ depends on $Q_{s}$ with\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{zz}}{\\partial Q_{s}}\\right)_{0}\\neq 0,\n$$\nand generally $\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\alpha_{\\perp}}{\\partial Q_{s}}\\right)_{0}$ may also be nonzero.
