Initial Circular Orbit**\n\nFor the satellite in a circular orbit of radius $R_0$, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force. Let $v_0$ be the orbital speed of the satellite before the collision.\n\nThe gravitational force is $F_g = \\frac{GMm}{R_0^2}$.\nThe centripetal force required is $F_c = \\frac{mv_0^2}{R_0}$.\n\nEquating these two forces gives:\n$$\n\\frac{mv_0^2}{R_0} = \\frac{GMm}{R_0^2}\n$$\nSolving for the initial speed $v_0$, we find:\n$$\nv_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R_0}}\n$$\nThe velocity vector at any point in the circular orbit is purely tangential.\n\n**2.
