The origin can be considered the boat's starting position.\n\nThe problem requires the velocity of the ASV relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{bg}$, to be directed purely North. This means its x-component must be zero. We can write this vector as:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{bg} = v_{bg} \\hat{j}\n$$\nwhere $v_{bg}$ is the magnitude we need to find, and $\\hat{j}$ is the unit vector in the North (positive y) direction.\n\nThe velocity of the ASV relative to the ground is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the water, $\\vec{v}_{bw}$, and the velocity of the water relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{wg}$.\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{bg} = \\vec{v}_{bw} + \\vec{v}_{wg}\n$$\n\nLet's decompose the given velocities into their x and y components.\n\nFirst, consider the velocity of the water relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{wg}$. Its magnitude is given as $v_{water} = 1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}$. The direction is $25.0^{\\circ}$ east of south. In our coordinate system, South is the negative y-direction. An angle $25.0^{\\circ}$ east of south corresponds to an angle of $-90^\\circ - 25.0^\\circ = -115.0^\\circ$ or $245.0^\\circ$ measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis (East).\nThe components are:\n$$\nv_{wg,x} = v_{water} \\cos(-115.0^\\circ) = (1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\cos(-115.0^\\circ)\n$$\n$$\nv_{wg,y} = v_{water} \\sin(-115.0^\\circ) = (1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\sin(-115.0^\\circ)\n$$\nAlternatively, and perhaps more intuitively, the angle with the negative y-axis is $25.0^\\circ$. So, the x-component is positive (East) and the y-component is negative (South).\n$$\nv_{wg,x} = v_{water} \\sin(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\n$$\nv_{wg,y} = -v_{water} \\cos(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\n\nNext, consider the velocity of the ASV relative to the water, $\\vec{v}_{bw}$. Its magnitude is given as $v_{boat} = 4.50 \\, \\text{m/s}$. To counteract the current's eastward drift and move purely north, the boat must steer somewhat to the west. Let $\\theta$ be the angle the boat's heading makes with the North (positive y-axis), measured towards the West.

Our strategy is to first determine the time it takes for the ball to reach the edge of the platform, as this time is the same for observers in both frames. Then, we will find the final positions of both the ball and the red dot in the platform's frame $S'$ at this time, and from there, calculate the required distance.\n\nLet's set up our coordinate systems. We place the origin of both frames, $S$ and $S'$, at the center of the platform. The $z$-axis for both frames points vertically upwards, along the axis of rotation, so $\\vec{\\omega} = \\omega \\hat{k}$. The problem states that from the perspective of the stationary observer on the ground (frame $S$), the ball travels in a straight line from the center to the edge with a constant speed $v_0$. The distance the ball travels in this frame is the radius $R$. Therefore, the time of flight, $t_f$, can be calculated as:\n$$t_f = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{speed}} = \\frac{R}{v_0}$$\n\nNow, let's track the positions of the red dot and the ball. At $t=0$, Alex rolls the ball towards the red dot. Let's align the positive $x$-axis of the inertial frame $S$ and the positive $x'$-axis of the rotating frame $S'$ with this initial direction. So, at $t=0$, the frames $S$ and $S'$ coincide.\n\nIn the rotating frame $S'$, the red dot is fixed to the platform. Since we defined the $x'$-axis to pass through the red dot at $t=0$, its position in the $S'$ frame is constant for all time:\n$$\\vec{r}'_{dot}(t) = R \\hat{i}'$$\nwhere $\\hat{i}'$ is the unit vector along the $x'$-axis. Thus, at the final time $t_f$, the red dot is at the point $(x', y') = (R, 0)$ in the platform's frame.\n\nNext, we find the final position of the ball. In the inertial frame $S$, the ball moves along the $x$-axis with constant speed $v_0$. Its position at any time $t$ is given by $\\vec{r}_{ball, S}(t) = v_0 t \\hat{i}$.
