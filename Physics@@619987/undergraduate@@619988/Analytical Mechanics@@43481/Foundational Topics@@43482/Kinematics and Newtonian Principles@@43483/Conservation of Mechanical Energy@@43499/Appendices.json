The incline makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal, and the initial vertical height of the block above the base of the incline is $h$. The incline merges seamlessly with a frictionless horizontal track. A light, horizontal spring with a spring constant $k$ is fixed to a rigid wall at one end. The other end of the spring is free and is located at the point where the incline meets the horizontal track. Let this point define the origin of a coordinate system, $x=0$. The block slides down the incline, moves along the horizontal track, and collides with the free end of the spring. The collision is instantaneous, and the block becomes permanently attached to the spring. Subsequently, the block-spring system undergoes simple harmonic motion.\n\nDerive an expression for the amplitude of this simple harmonic motion in terms of $m$, $g$, $h$, and $k$.

The device consists of a spring-loaded launcher that shoots a solid sphere up a curved track. The sphere has a mass $M$ and a radius $R$. The launcher uses a spring with a spring constant $k$. For each test, the spring is compressed by a distance $x$ from its equilibrium length, with the sphere placed against it at rest.

The only potential energies in the system are the spring potential energy and the gravitational potential energy. Static friction and the normal force from the fixed track do no work because, for rolling without slipping on a stationary track, the instantaneous velocity of the point of contact is zero, so the instantaneous power of the contact forces is zero.
