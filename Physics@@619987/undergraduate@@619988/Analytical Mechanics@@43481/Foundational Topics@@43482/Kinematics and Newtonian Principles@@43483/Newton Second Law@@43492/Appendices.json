By introducing an electric force alongside gravity, it underscores the crucial fact that net force—and thus acceleration—depends on the sum of all interactions, some of which may not be proportional to mass.", "problem": "An experiment is conducted inside a large, evacuated vertical chamber where the acceleration due to gravity is a constant, $g$, directed downwards. Two small spheres are prepared for a simultaneous drop test. The first, lighter sphere has a mass $m_L$, and the second, heavier sphere has a mass $m_H$. Prior to release, both spheres are imparted with an identical positive electric charge, $q$. Throughout the chamber, a uniform electric field of magnitude $E$ is present, directed vertically upwards. The spheres are released from rest at the same instant from the same height. Assuming the only forces acting on the spheres are due to gravity and the electric field, find the ratio of the initial downward acceleration of the light sphere, $a_L$, to that of the heavy sphere, $a_H$. Your answer should be a single, closed-form analytic expression in terms of $g$, $E$, $q$, $m_L$, and $m_H$.", "solution": "Take the downward vertical direction as positive.
