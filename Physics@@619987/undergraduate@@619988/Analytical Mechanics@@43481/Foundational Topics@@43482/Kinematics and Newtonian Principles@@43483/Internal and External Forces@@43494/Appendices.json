In its final configuration, the middle rod is oriented parallel to the y-axis. The two end rods are attached to the respective ends of the middle rod, and they are both oriented parallel to the x-axis, pointing in the same direction (in the positive x-direction).\n\nDetermine the final x-coordinate of the center of the middle rod.
