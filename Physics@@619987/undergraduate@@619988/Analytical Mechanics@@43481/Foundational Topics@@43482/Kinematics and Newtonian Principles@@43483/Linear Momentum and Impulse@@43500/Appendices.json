This practice examines the concept of an isolated system and the immutability of its center of mass in the absence of external forces, a direct consequence of momentum conservation. By tracking the movement of a scientist on a raft, you will calculate the raft's displacement, learning how internal motions within a system affect the positions of its components while the overall center of mass remains fixed.

The raft is initially at rest in a large, calm lake. The scientist is at one end of the raft, which we shall call the stern. A delicate instrument package of mass $m_p$ is located at the other end, the bow.\n\nThe experiment proceeds in two stages. First, the scientist walks from the stern to the bow to retrieve the package. Assume the scientist moves at a steady pace and stops completely upon reaching the bow. Second, immediately after stopping, the scientist picks up the package and throws it horizontally back towards the stern, parallel to the raft's long axis. The package is launched with a speed $u$ *relative to the raft*.\n\nDetermine the total displacement of the center of the raft from its initial position. The displacement should be measured at the exact moment the package has traveled a horizontal distance of $L$ away from the moving raft after being thrown. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $m$, $M$, $m_p$, and $L$.", "solution": "This problem can be solved by analyzing the motion in two separate stages, applying the principle of conservation of momentum. Since there are no external horizontal forces acting on the system (scientist + raft + package), the horizontal position of the center of mass of the total system must remain constant throughout the entire process, provided the system starts from rest.\n\nLet's set up a one-dimensional inertial coordinate system with the origin on the shore. Let the raft initially be positioned with its stern at $x=0$ and its bow at $x=L$. The center of the raft is initially at $x_{raft, i} = L/2$. The scientist is at the stern, so their initial position is $x_{sci, i} = 0$. The package is at the bow, so its initial position is $x_{pkg, i} = L$.\n\nThe initial position of the center of mass (CM) of the entire system is given by:\n$$X_{CM} = \\frac{m x_{sci, i} + M x_{raft, i} + m_p x_{pkg, i}}{m + M + m_p}$$\n$$X_{CM} = \\frac{m(0) + M(L/2) + m_p(L)}{m + M + m_p} = \\frac{(M/2 + m_p)L}{m + M + m_p}$$\n\n**Stage 1: The scientist walks from stern to bow.**\n\nDuring the walk, the total system remains isolated from external horizontal forces, so its CM position does not change. Let's say the raft moves a distance $D_1$ along the x-axis. After the walk, the scientist is at the bow. The stern's new position is $D_1$, and the bow's new position is $D_1 + L$. The center of the raft is now at $x_{raft, 1} = D_1 + L/2$. The scientist and the package are both at the bow, so their new position is $x_{sci, 1} = x_{pkg, 1} = D_1 + L$.\n\nThe position of the system's CM at the end of Stage 1 is:\n$$X'_{CM} = \\frac{m x_{sci, 1} + M x_{raft, 1} + m_p x_{pkg, 1}}{m + M + m_p}$$\n$$X'_{CM} = \\frac{m(D_1 + L) + M(D_1 + L/2) + m_p(D_1 + L)}{m + M + m_p}$$\n\nSince $X_{CM} = X'_{CM}$:\n$$\\frac{(M/2 + m_p)L}{m + M + m_p} = \\frac{(m + M + m_p)D_1 + (m + M/2 + m_p)L}{m + M + m_p}$$\n$$(M/2 + m_p)L = (m + M + m_p)D_1 + mL + (M/2)L + m_pL$$\n$$0 = (m + M + m_p)D_1 + mL$$\n$$D_1 = -\\frac{mL}{m + M + m_p}$$\nThe displacement of the center of the raft during this first stage is $\\Delta x_1 = (D_1 + L/2) - L/2 = D_1$. So, $\\Delta x_1 = -\\frac{mL}{m+M+m_p}$. At the end of this stage, the entire system is once again at rest.\n\n**Stage 2: The scientist throws the package.**\n\nThe throw is an internal process for the (scientist + raft + package) system. The total momentum, which is zero just before the throw, must remain zero after the throw. The system splits into two parts: the package, and the (scientist + raft). Let $v_p$ be the velocity of the package relative to the shore, and $v_{sr}$ be the velocity of the (scientist + raft) system relative to the shore.\nConservation of linear momentum gives:\n$$m_p v_p + (m+M)v_{sr} = 0$$\nThe problem states that the package is thrown with speed $u$ relative to the raft, back towards the stern. In our coordinate system, this corresponds to a velocity of $-u$.\n$$v_{p/r} = v_p - v_{sr} = -u$$\nFrom this, we find the package's velocity relative to the shore: $v_p = v_{sr} - u$. Substituting this into the momentum conservation equation:\n$$m_p (v_{sr} - u) + (m+M)v_{sr} = 0$$\n$$m_p v_{sr} - m_p u + (m+M)v_{sr} = 0$$\n$$(m_p + m + M)v_{sr} = m_p u$$\n$$v_{sr} = \\frac{m_p u}{m+M+m_p}$$\nThis is the velocity of the raft after the throw.\n\n**Final Displacement Calculation:**\n\nThe problem asks for the displacement at the moment the package has traveled a horizontal distance of $L$ away from the raft. Let $t=0$ be the instant the package is thrown. The relative speed between the package and the raft is precisely the speed at which it was thrown relative to the raft, which is $u$.\nThe time $t^*$ required for the separation distance to become $L$ is:\n$$t^* = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\text{relative speed}} = \\frac{L}{u}$$\nDuring this time $t^*$, the raft moves with a constant velocity $v_{sr}$. The additional displacement of the raft's center during this time is:\n$$\\Delta x_2 = v_{sr} t^* = \\left( \\frac{m_p u}{m+M+m_p} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L}{u} \\right) = \\frac{m_p L}{m+M+m_p}$$\n\nThe total displacement of the center of the raft from its initial position is the sum of the displacements from the two stages:\n$$\\Delta x_{total} = \\Delta x_1 + \\Delta x_2$$\n$$\\Delta x_{total} = -\\frac{mL}{m+M+m_p} + \\frac{m_p L}{m+M+m_p}$$\n$$\\Delta x_{total} = \\frac{(m_p-m)L}{m+M+m_p}$$\nThe velocity $u$ cancels out and does not appear in the final expression for the total displacement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(m_p - m)L}{m + M + m_p}}$$", "id": "2064403"}, {"introduction": "This practice shifts our focus from momentum conservation to impulse, which is the change in momentum experienced by an object during a collision.

First, the component of the bead's velocity normal (perpendicular) to the surface is affected by a coefficient of restitution, $e$. This means the magnitude of the normal component of velocity just after impact is $e$ times its magnitude just before impact. Second, due to kinetic friction, the component of the bead's velocity tangential (parallel) to the surface just after impact is a fraction $\\alpha$ of its tangential component just before impact.
