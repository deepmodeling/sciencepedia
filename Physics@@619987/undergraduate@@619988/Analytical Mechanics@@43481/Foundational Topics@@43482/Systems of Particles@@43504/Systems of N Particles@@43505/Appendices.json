By analyzing a stream of beads striking a surface, you will see how discrete momentum-transfer events give rise to a continuous, average force.

This problem introduces a pivot, a common type of constraint that fundamentally alters which physical quantities are conserved during a collision. You will explore a perfectly inelastic collision where you must critically determine whether linear momentum or angular momentum is the conserved quantity, justifying your choice by analyzing the external forces and torques acting on the system. This exercise hones your ability to select the appropriate conservation law, a crucial skill in mechanics.

It is on a collision course with a thin, uniform rigid rod of mass $M$ and length $L$. The rod is also lying on the same table and is initially at rest. One end of the rod is fixed to the table by a frictionless pivot, allowing the rod to rotate freely in the horizontal plane. The clay's velocity vector is perpendicular to the long axis of the rod. The clay strikes the rod at a point located at a distance $d$ from the pivot and sticks to it, forming a single composite object. The collision is instantaneous. Find the magnitude of the angular velocity, $\\omega$, of the rod-clay system immediately after this perfectly inelastic collision. Express your answer in terms of $m, M, L, v_0,$ and $d$.", "solution": "During the instantaneous, perfectly inelastic collision, linear momentum of the clay-rod system is not conserved due to the external impulse from the pivot. However, the external impulse at the pivot exerts zero torque about the pivot, so angular momentum about the pivot is conserved during the collision.\n\nLet the pivot be the origin. Just before impact, the clay of mass $m$ moves with speed $v_{0}$ along a direction perpendicular to the rod. The collision point is at distance $d$ from the pivot along the rod, so the position vector $\\mathbf{r}$ from the pivot to the clay is perpendicular to its velocity $\\mathbf{v}$. Hence the initial angular momentum magnitude about the pivot is\n$$\nL_{\\text{i}}=m v_{0} d.\n$$\n\nImmediately after the clay sticks, the rod and clay rotate together as a rigid body about the pivot with angular velocity $\\omega$.

At any instant when the block is at height $y$ above the ground, a length $y$ of the chain has been lifted off the ground and moves together with the block at the constant speed $v$.

The rate at which mass is added is\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt}=\\lambda\\,\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\lambda v.\n$$\n\nApply linear momentum balance to a control volume that instantaneously coincides with the moving assembly (block plus lifted portion of chain). The general statement is that the sum of external forces equals the time rate of change of total linear momentum inside the control volume plus the net flux of linear momentum across its boundary. Here, the only momentum flux across the control surface occurs where new chain enters the moving assembly from the ground; that incoming chain has zero absolute velocity, so it contributes no momentum flux.
