This practice problem [@problem_id:2062438] provides a clear illustration of this concept.

The blocks are free to slide on a frictionless horizontal table. Initially, the system is at rest with the spring compressed to a length $L$, where $L < L_0$. At time $t=0$, a sharp horizontal kick is delivered to block $m_1$, imparting an instantaneous impulse of magnitude $J$. The impulse is directed along the line connecting the two masses, in the direction pointing from $m_2$ towards $m_1$. Determine the velocity of the center of mass of the two-block system for any time $t > 0$.

The classic Atwood machine in this exercise [@problem_id:2062455] is an ideal model for this purpose. It challenges you to go beyond simple intuition and apply the definition of CoM acceleration rigorously, demonstrating that it depends on the motion of the individual components as constrained by internal forces.", "problem": "An idealized elevator system is modeled as an elevator car of mass $M$ and a counterweight of mass $m$, connected by a light, inextensible cable that runs over a large, massless, and frictionless pulley. The entire apparatus operates within a uniform gravitational field, characterized by the acceleration due to gravity, $g$. Initially, the car and counterweight are held stationary at the same vertical level. At time $t=0$, the system is released from rest. Determine the magnitude of the initial acceleration of the center of mass of the combined elevator-and-counterweight system. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $M$, $m$, and $g$.", "solution": "Let's establish a coordinate system to describe the motion of the masses. Let the vertical direction be the y-axis, with the upward direction defined as positive. Let the origin, $y=0$, be located at the axle of the pulley. The position of the elevator car is $y_M$ and the position of the counterweight is $y_m$. Since the system is released from rest with both masses at the same vertical level, their initial positions are the same, let's say $y_0$. However, their subsequent positions are constrained by the inextensible cable.\n\nThe total length of the cable, $L$, is constant. If we denote the distance from the pulley to each mass along the cable, the constraint is that the sum of these distances is constant. This implies that the sum of the vertical speeds and the sum of the vertical accelerations must be zero. Let $a_M$ be the acceleration of the elevator car and $a_m$ be the acceleration of the counterweight. The constraint of the inextensible cable implies:\n$a_M = -a_m$.\nLet $a = |a_M| = |a_m|$ be the magnitude of the acceleration of each mass.\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's assume $M > m$. In this case, the heavier elevator car will accelerate downwards, and the lighter counterweight will accelerate upwards. According to our coordinate system (upward is positive):\n$a_M = -a$\n$a_m = a$\n\nNow, we apply Newton's second law to each mass. The forces on each mass are gravity (downwards) and the tension $T$ in the cable (upwards).\n\nFor the elevator car (mass $M$):\n$$F_{net, M} = T - Mg = M a_M = M(-a)$$\n$$T - Mg = -Ma \\quad (1)$$\n\nFor the counterweight (mass $m$):\n$$F_{net, m} = T - mg = m a_m = m(a)$$\n$$T - mg = ma \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $T$ and $a$. We can solve for $a$. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n$$(T - mg) - (T - Mg) = ma - (-Ma)$$\n$$-mg + Mg = a(m+M)$$\n$$g(M - m) = a(M + m)$$\nSolving for the magnitude of the acceleration $a$:\n$$a = g \\frac{M - m}{M + m}$$\nNote that if $m > M$, $a$ would be negative, which simply means our initial assumption about the direction of motion was reversed, but the magnitude calculation remains correct upon taking the absolute value. For our derivation, we stick with the expression as is.\n\nNow, we need to find the acceleration of the center of mass ($A_{CM}$) of the two-mass system. The position of the center of mass, $Y_{CM}$, is given by:\n$$Y_{CM} = \\frac{M y_M + m y_m}{M + m}$$\n\nTo find the acceleration of the center of mass, we differentiate $Y_{CM}$ twice with respect to time:\n$$A_{CM} = \\frac{d^2 Y_{CM}}{dt^2} = \\frac{M \\frac{d^2 y_M}{dt^2} + m \\frac{d^2 y_m}{dt^2}}{M + m} = \\frac{M a_M + m a_m}{M + m}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $a_M = -a$ and $a_m = a$:\n$$A_{CM} = \\frac{M(-a) + m(a)}{M + m} = \\frac{-a(M - m)}{M + m} = -a \\frac{M - m}{M + m}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression we found for $a$:\n$$A_{CM} = -\\left(g \\frac{M - m}{M + m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{M - m}{M + m}\\right)$$\n$$A_{CM} = -g \\left(\\frac{M - m}{M + m}\\right)^2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the initial acceleration of the center of mass. The magnitude is the absolute value of $A_{CM}$. Since the term in the parenthesis is squared, the result is always non-negative.\n$$|A_{CM}| = \\left|-g \\left(\\frac{M - m}{M + m}\\right)^2\\right| = g \\left(\\frac{M - m}{M + m}\\right)^2$$\n\nThe negative sign in the vector expression for $A_{CM}$ indicates that the center of mass always accelerates downwards (or has zero acceleration if $M=m$), which is physically sensible. The net downward force on the system from gravity is $(M+m)g$, while the net upward force from the pulley support is $2T$. Since $2T < (M+m)g$ for $M \\neq m$, the system's center of mass must accelerate downwards.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{g \\left(\\frac{M - m}{M + m}\\right)^{2}}$$", "id": "2062455"}, {"introduction": "The true analytical power of the center-of-mass frame shines when simplifying problems involving energy and momentum.
