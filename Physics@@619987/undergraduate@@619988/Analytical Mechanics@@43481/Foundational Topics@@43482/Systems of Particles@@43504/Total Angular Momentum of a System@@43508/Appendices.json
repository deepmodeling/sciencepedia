This principle states that the total angular momentum about a fixed point is the sum of the angular momentum of the center of mass (CM) about that point (the \"orbital\" part) and the angular momentum of the system about its center of mass (the \"spin\" part).\n\n$$ \\vec{L}_{\\text{total}} = \\vec{L}_{\\text{orb}} + \\vec{L}_{\\text{spin}} $$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the orbital angular momentum, $\\vec{L}_{\\text{orb}}$. This is the angular momentum of the entire system's mass, treated as a single point mass located at the center of mass, orbiting the central point. The total mass of the system is $M_{\\text{total}} = m_1 + m_2$. The center of mass moves in a circle of radius $R$ with angular velocity $\\omega_o$. The moment of inertia of the total mass about the center of the orbit is $I_{\\text{orb}}$.\n\n$$ I_{\\text{orb}} = M_{\\text{total}} R^2 = (m_1+m_2)R^2 $$\n\nSo, the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum is:\n\n$$ L_{\\text{orb}} = I_{\\text{orb}} \\omega_o = (m_1+m_2)R^2 \\omega_o $$\n\nNext, we calculate the spin angular momentum, $\\vec{L}_{\\text{spin}}$. This is the angular momentum of the dumbbell's rotation about its own center of mass. The magnitude is given by $L_{\\text{spin}} = I_{CM} \\omega_s$, where $I_{CM}$ is the moment of inertia of the dumbbell about its center of mass.\n\nTo find $I_{CM}$, we first need to find the distances of the two masses from their common center of mass. Let the center of mass be at the origin of a coordinate system aligned with the rod. Let the distances of $m_1$ and $m_2$ from the CM be $r_1$ and $r_2$, respectively. By the definition of the center of mass, $m_1 r_1 = m_2 r_2$. We also know that the total length of the rod is $L = r_1 + r_2$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we have $r_1 = \\frac{m_2}{m_1} r_2$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{m_2}{m_1} r_2 + r_2 = L \\implies r_2 \\left(\\frac{m_2+m_1}{m_1}\\right) = L \\implies r_2 = \\frac{m_1 L}{m_1+m_2} $$\n\nSimilarly, we find $r_1$:\n\n$$ r_1 = L - r_2 = L - \\frac{m_1 L}{m_1+m_2} = \\frac{L(m_1+m_2) - m_1 L}{m_1+m_2} = \\frac{m_2 L}{m_1+m_2} $$\n\nNow, the moment of inertia about the center of mass is the sum of the moments of inertia of the two point masses:\n\n$$ I_{CM} = m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2 $$\n$$ I_{CM} = m_1 \\left(\\frac{m_2 L}{m_1+m_2}\\right)^2 + m_2 \\left(\\frac{m_1 L}{m_1+m_2}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ I_{CM} = \\frac{m_1 m_2^2 L^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} + \\frac{m_2 m_1^2 L^2}{(m_1+m_2)^2} $$\n$$ I_{CM} = \\frac{m_1 m_2 L^2 (m_2 + m_1)}{(m_1+m_2)^2} = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2} L^2 $$\n\nThe expression $\\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2}$ is the reduced mass, often denoted by $\\mu$. So, $I_{CM} = \\mu L^2$.\nThe magnitude of the spin angular momentum is:\n\n$$ L_{\\text{spin}} = I_{CM} \\omega_s = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2} L^2 \\omega_s $$\n\nFinally, we find the magnitude of the total angular momentum. The problem states that the axis of spin rotation is parallel to the axis of orbital rotation, and the directions are the same. This means the vectors $\\vec{L}_{\\text{orb}}$ and $\\vec{L}_{\\text{spin}}$ are parallel.
