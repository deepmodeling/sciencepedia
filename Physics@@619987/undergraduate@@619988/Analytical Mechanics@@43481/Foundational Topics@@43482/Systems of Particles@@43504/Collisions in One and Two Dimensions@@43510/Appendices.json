We can establish a coordinate system where the positive x-axis is in the direction of the block's initial velocity and the y-axis is vertical.\n\nThe first key principle is the conservation of momentum. Since both the block and the wedge are on a frictionless horizontal surface, there are no external horizontal forces acting on the block-wedge system. Therefore, the total horizontal momentum of the system is conserved throughout the interaction.\n\nThe second key principle is the conservation of mechanical energy. The problem states that all surfaces are frictionless and the interaction conserves mechanical energy. This means the sum of the kinetic and potential energies of the system remains constant.\n\nLet's define the initial state (subscript $i$) as the moment just before the block starts to move up the wedge.

At this peak point, the vertical component of the block's velocity is momentarily zero. Furthermore, for the block to be at its highest point relative to the wedge, its velocity component parallel to the wedge's surface must be zero relative to the wedge.
