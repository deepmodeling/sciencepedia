The process begins with a single straight line segment. In each step of the algorithm, every existing straight line segment is replaced by a new pattern of segments. The replacement rule is as follows: given a line segment, retain the first quarter and the final quarter of its length. Then, replace the middle half of the segment with a rectangular 'detour' path consisting of four new segments. Each of these four new segments has a length exactly equal to one-quarter of the length of the original segment being replaced. The resulting structure, after an infinite number of iterations, is a fractal. Calculate the similarity dimension of this fractal.

Under the replacement rule, each segment is replaced by:\n- two straight segments retained from the first and last quarters, each of length $L/4$,\n- four segments forming the rectangular detour, each of length $L/4$.\n\nThus, each original segment is replaced by $N=6$ segments, each scaled by a factor $r=\\frac{1}{4}$ relative to the original.
