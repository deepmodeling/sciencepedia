The system is driven by a time-periodic matrix $A(t)$ with period $T > 0$. The matrix $A(t)$ is defined piecewise over one period, for $0 \\le t < T$, as follows:\n\n$$\nA(t) = \\begin{cases}\nA_1 & \\text{for } 0 \\le t < \\frac{T}{2} \\\\\nA_2 & \\text{for } \\frac{T}{2} \\le t < T\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $A_1$ and $A_2$ are constant matrices given by:\n\n$$\nA_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\alpha \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad A_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ \\alpha & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\alpha$ is a real, non-zero constant.

The monodromy matrix $M$ relates the solution at time $t=0$ to the solution at $t=T$ via $\\mathbf{x}(T) = M\\mathbf{x}(0)$.\n\nWe can find the monodromy matrix by integrating the system over one full period, from $t=0$ to $t=T$. Since the matrix $A(t)$ is piecewise constant, we can solve the system on each interval and then compose the solutions.\n\n**Step 1: Solve the system on the interval $0 \\le t < T/2$.**\nOn this interval, the system is $\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = A_1\\mathbf{x}$, where $A_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\alpha \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a linear system with a constant coefficient matrix.
