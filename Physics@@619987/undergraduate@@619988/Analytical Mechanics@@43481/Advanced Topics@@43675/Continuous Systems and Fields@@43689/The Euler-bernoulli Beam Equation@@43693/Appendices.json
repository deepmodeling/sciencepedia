For design and calibration purposes, we model the probe as a cantilever beam. The probe has a length $L$, a solid circular cross-section of radius $r$, and is made from a material with a Young's modulus of $E$. In a ground test, the probe is fixed horizontally at one end.

This can be determined using the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory.\n\nThe governing differential equation for the deflection $w(x)$ of a beam is given by:\n$$EI \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = M(x)$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus, $I$ is the area moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section, and $M(x)$ is the internal bending moment as a function of the position $x$ along the beam.\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system where $x=0$ is at the fixed (cantilevered) end and $x=L$ is at the free end where the force $F$ is applied. Let $w(x)$ represent the upward vertical displacement. The downward force $F$ is applied at $x=L$.\n\nFirst, we determine the bending moment $M(x)$ at an arbitrary cross-section $x$. Consider the portion of the beam from $x$ to $L$. For this section to be in static equilibrium, the moment at the cut face at $x$ must balance the moment generated by the force $F$ at the end. Taking moments about the point at position $x$:\n$$M(x) + F(L-x) = 0$$\nThe convention used here is that a positive bending moment causes the beam to bend into a \"smile\" shape (positive curvature/concave up). The downward force $F$ causes the beam to bend downwards (negative curvature/concave down), so the internal moment is negative.\n$$M(x) = -F(L-x)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this into the Euler-Bernoulli equation:\n$$EI \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = -F(L-x)$$\n\nTo find the deflection $w(x)$, we integrate this equation twice with respect to $x$.
