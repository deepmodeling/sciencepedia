Let's solve for each component step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the magnetic field B**\nThe electric field is given as $\\mathbf{E}(z, t) = E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t) \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$. We can find the magnetic field using Faraday's law of induction in differential form, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the curl of $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{\\hat{x}} & \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} & \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\\\ E_x & 0 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial z} - \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} \\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y} $$\nSince $E_x = E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t)$ depends only on $z$ and $t$, the $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$ term is zero.\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t)) = -k E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} $$\nNow, we set this equal to $-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$:\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -k E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = k E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} $$\nIntegrating with respect to time $t$ to find $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{B}(z, t) = \\int k E_0 \\sin(kz - \\omega t) dt \\, \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = k E_0 \\left( \\frac{\\cos(kz - \\omega t)}{\\omega} \\right) \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} + \\mathbf{C}(z) $$\nThe constant of integration $\\mathbf{C}(z)$ represents a static magnetic field, which is not part of the wave, so we set it to zero. For a plane wave in vacuum, the ratio of angular frequency to wave number is the speed of light, $\\omega/k = c$. Thus, $k/\\omega = 1/c$.\n$$ \\mathbf{B}(z, t) = \\frac{E_0}{c} \\cos(kz - \\omega t) \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the time-averaged energy density $\\langle T^{00} \\rangle$**\nThe energy density is given by $T^{00} = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E^2 + \\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} B^2$.\nThe squared magnitudes of the fields are:\n$E^2 = |\\mathbf{E}|^2 = E_x^2 = E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t)$\n$B^2 = |\\mathbf{B}|^2 = B_y^2 = \\left(\\frac{E_0}{c}\\right)^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t)$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $T^{00}$:\n$$ T^{00} = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) + \\frac{1}{2\\mu_0} \\frac{E_0^2}{c^2} \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) $$\nUsing the relation $c^2 = 1/(\\epsilon_0 \\mu_0)$, we can write $1/(\\mu_0 c^2) = \\epsilon_0$.\n$$ T^{00} = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) = \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) $$\nTo find the time-average, we need the average of $\\cos^2(kz - \\omega t)$ over one period $T=2\\pi/\\omega$.\n$$ \\langle \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) dt = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\frac{1 + \\cos(2(kz - \\omega t))}{2} dt = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe integral of the cosine term over a full period is zero.\nSo, the time-averaged energy density is:\n$$ \\langle T^{00} \\rangle = \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\langle \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the time-averaged momentum density component $\\langle T^{0z} \\rangle$**\nThe z-component of the momentum density (times c) is $T^{0z} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 c}(\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B})^z$.\nFirst, we find the cross product $\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B} = (E_x \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}) \\times (B_y \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}) = E_x B_y (\\mathbf{\\hat{x}} \\times \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}) = E_x B_y \\mathbf{\\hat{z}} $$\nThe z-component is $(\\mathbf{E} \\times \\mathbf{B})^z = E_x B_y$.\n$$ E_x B_y = (E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t)) \\left(\\frac{E_0}{c} \\cos(kz - \\omega t)\\right) = \\frac{E_0^2}{c} \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) $$\nNow substitute this into the expression for $T^{0z}$:\n$$ T^{0z} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 c} \\left( \\frac{E_0^2}{c} \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) \\right) = \\frac{E_0^2}{\\mu_0 c^2} \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) $$\nUsing $1/(\\mu_0 c^2) = \\epsilon_0$ again:\n$$ T^{0z} = \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) $$\nThis expression is identical to the instantaneous energy density $T^{00}$. Its time-average is therefore the same:\n$$ \\langle T^{0z} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the time-averaged stress component $\\langle T^{xx} \\rangle$**\nThe stress component $T^{xx}$ is given by the formula for $T^{ij}$ with $i=j=x$:\n$$ T^{xx} = - \\left( \\epsilon_0 E_x^2 + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} B_x^2 \\right) + T^{00} \\delta^{xx} $$\nFrom our field expressions, we have $E_x = E_0\\cos(kz-\\omega t)$, while all other components of $\\mathbf{E}$ are zero. The magnetic field only has a y-component, so $B_x=0$. Also, $\\delta^{xx}=1$.\n$$ T^{xx} = - \\left( \\epsilon_0 (E_0 \\cos(kz - \\omega t))^2 + 0 \\right) + T^{00} = -\\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) + T^{00} $$\nFrom Step 2, we found that $T^{00} = \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t)$. Substituting this in:\n$$ T^{xx} = -\\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) + \\epsilon_0 E_0^2 \\cos^2(kz - \\omega t) = 0 $$\nThe instantaneous value of $T^{xx}$ is zero at all times. Therefore, its time-average is also zero:\n$$ \\langle T^{xx} \\rangle = 0 $$\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the final answer**\nThe problem asks for the three quantities $(\\langle T^{00} \\rangle, \\langle T^{0z} \\rangle, \\langle T^{xx} \\rangle)$ as a row matrix.\n$$ \\langle T^{00} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n$$ \\langle T^{0z} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_0^2 $$\n$$ \\langle T^{xx} \\rangle = 0 $$\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix with these three expressions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_0^{2} & \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon_0 E_0^{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1876330"}, {"introduction": "Beyond fields, the stress-energy tensor is essential for describing matter distributions, a cornerstone of cosmology.
