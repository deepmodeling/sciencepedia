A Lagrangian $L(q, \\dot{q})$ is termed singular if it is not possible to express all velocities $\\dot{q}_i$ as functions of coordinates $q_i$ and canonical momenta $p_i$, leading to primary constraints in the phase space.\n\nConsider a system described by two generalized coordinates, $q_1$ and $q_2$. The canonical momenta are defined by the standard relation $p_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}$. The canonical Hamiltonian is constructed via the Legendre transformation, $H_c = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} p_i \\dot{q}_i - L$.\n\nSuppose that after performing this procedure, the system is found to be described by a canonical Hamiltonian $H_c = \\frac{1}{2}p_1^2 + q_1 q_2$ and possesses a single primary constraint given by $\\phi = p_2 \\approx 0$.

The key pieces of information are the canonical Hamiltonian $H_c = \\frac{1}{2}p_1^2 + q_1 q_2$ and the primary constraint $\\phi = p_2 \\approx 0$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the primary constraint. A primary constraint is a relationship between coordinates and momenta that arises directly from the definitions of the canonical momenta, $p_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}$. The given constraint is $p_2 \\approx 0$. For this relationsip to hold identically as a result of the definition of $p_2$, the Lagrangian $L$ cannot have any functional dependence on the velocity $\\dot{q}_2$. Therefore, we can write the Lagrangian in the general form $L = L(q_1, q_2, \\dot{q}_1)$.\n\nNext, we consider the momentum $p_1$. The problem states that $p_2 \\approx 0$ is the *only* primary constraint. This implies that the definition for $p_1$, which is $p_1 = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_1}$, must be invertible. That is, we must be able to solve for $\\dot{q}_1$ as a function of $q_1, q_2$, and $p_1$. A singular relationship for $p_1$ would introduce another primary constraint, which is contrary to the problem statement. The simplest way to ensure this invertibility is to assume a standard quadratic dependence of $L$ on $\\dot{q}_1$.\n\nBased on these considerations, let's propose a simple and common structure for our Lagrangian, separating it into a kinetic-like term and a potential-like term:\n$$L = T(\\dot{q}_1) - V(q_1, q_2)$$\nFor the simplest non-trivial kinetic term, we choose $T(\\dot{q}_1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{q}_1^2$. Our ansatz for the Lagrangian is thus:\n$$L(q_1, q_2, \\dot{q}_1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{q}_1^2 - V(q_1, q_2)$$\nThis form correctly has no dependence on $\\dot{q}_2$, so it will generate $p_2 = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_2} = 0$.\n\nNow, let's compute the first canonical momentum from our ansatz:\n$$p_1 = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\dot{q}_1} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{q}_1^2 - V(q_1, q_2) \\right) = \\dot{q}_1$$\nThis relation is trivially invertible: $\\dot{q}_1 = p_1$.\n\nWith these momentum definitions, we can construct the canonical Hamiltonian, $H_c = p_1 \\dot{q}_1 + p_2 \\dot{q}_2 - L$. We substitute our derived expressions for $p_1$, $p_2$, and $L$:\n$$H_c = p_1 \\dot{q}_1 + (0) \\dot{q}_2 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{q}_1^2 - V(q_1, q_2) \\right)$$\nTo express $H_c$ purely in terms of phase space variables $(q_1, q_2, p_1, p_2)$, we replace the remaining velocity $\\dot{q}_1$ with its equivalent momentum expression, $\\dot{q}_1 = p_1$:\n$$H_c = p_1(p_1) - \\left( \\frac{1}{2}p_1^2 - V(q_1, q_2) \\right)$$\n$$H_c = p_1^2 - \\frac{1}{2}p_1^2 + V(q_1, q_2) = \\frac{1}{2}p_1^2 + V(q_1, q_2)$$\n\nFinally, we compare this derived Hamiltonian with the one given in the problem statement:\n$$H_c(\\text{derived}) = \\frac{1}{2}p_1^2 + V(q_1, q_2)$$\n$$H_c(\\text{given}) = \\frac{1}{2}p_1^2 + q_1 q_2$$\nBy direct comparison, we find that the potential function must be $V(q_1, q_2) = q_1 q_2$.\n\nSubstituting this potential back into our Lagrangian ansatz gives the required Lagrangian:\n$$L(q_1, q_2, \\dot{q}_1, \\dot{q}_2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{q}_1^2 - q_1 q_2$$\nThis is a simple, non-trivial singular Lagrangian that generates the specified constrained Hamiltonian system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}\\dot{q}_1^{2} - q_1 q_2}$$", "id": "2053008"}]}
