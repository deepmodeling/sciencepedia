This is a non-inertial reference frame because the pod is accelerating relative to the ground (an inertial frame).\n\nLet's set up a coordinate system fixed to the pod. Let the origin be the point on the floor directly below the sphere's release point. Let the positive $y$-axis point vertically upwards, and the positive $x$-axis point horizontally in the direction of the pod's acceleration, $a$. Then the initial position of the sphere is $(x_0, y_0) = (0, h)$.\n\nIn a non-inertial frame accelerating with $\\vec{a}_{frame}$, an object of mass $m$ experiences a fictitious force, $\\vec{F}_{fict} = -m\\vec{a}_{frame}$. In this problem, the pod's acceleration is $\\vec{a}_{frame} = a \\hat{x}$. Therefore, the fictitious force on the sphere is $\\vec{F}_{fict} = -ma \\hat{x}$.

We can find the time of flight, $t_{fall}$, by analyzing the vertical motion. The sphere falls a distance $h$.\nUsing the kinematic equation for vertical displacement:\n$$\n\\Delta y = y_{final} - y_{initial} = v_{0y} t_{fall} + \\frac{1}{2} a_{rel, y} t_{fall}^2\n$$\n$$\n0 - h = (0)t_{fall} + \\frac{1}{2}(-g)t_{fall}^2\n$$\n$$\n-h = -\\frac{1}{2} g t_{fall}^2\n$$\nSolving for $t_{fall}$:\n$$\nt_{fall} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h}{g}}\n$$\nNow, we can find the horizontal distance traveled during this time.
