A small, unpowered float is released into the water at a point $A$, located exactly in the middle of the river's width. Simultaneously, a motorboat starts from a point $B$ on one of the riverbanks. Point $B$ is located a distance $D$ downstream from the point on the same bank that is directly adjacent to $A$. The boat is capable of maintaining a constant speed $v_b$ relative to the surrounding water. To intercept the float, the boat must be aimed in a specific, constant direction.\n\nLet a line be drawn from the boat's starting point $B$ directly across the river, perpendicular to the banks. Determine the angle $\\theta$ between this line and the direction of the boat's velocity relative to the water.

Its ground (lab-frame) velocity is the vector sum of its through-water velocity and the current. To simplify the interception condition, switch to a frame moving with the current (a Galilean transformation). In this frame, subtracting $\\vec{v}_{c}$ from all velocities, the float is stationary at $A=(W/2,0)$, while the boat starts at $B=(0,D)$ and moves at constant velocity equal to its through-water velocity vector, with magnitude $v_{b}$ and fixed direction.\n\nInterception requires the boat’s straight-line trajectory in the current frame to pass through $A$.
