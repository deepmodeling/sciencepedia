This force, which seems to pull objects away from the center of rotation, is responsible for everything from the shape of the spinning Earth to the operation of a centrifuge. In this problem [@problem_id:2049604], we will create a perfectly balanced system on a turntable, where the outward centrifugal force on a mass $m_1$ is precisely countered by the tension from a hanging weight $m_2$. This static equilibrium scenario allows us to derive a crisp, clear relationship for the centrifugal force, cementing our understanding of its behavior in a rotating frame.", "problem": "A materials science laboratory is testing a device called a \"Radial Equilibrium Centrifuge\" to study the effects of artificial gravity. The device consists of a large, perfectly flat, horizontal turntable that can rotate at a constant angular velocity. A small, frictionless hole is located at the exact center of the turntable.\n\nA puck of mass $m_1$ is placed on the frictionless surface of the turntable. This puck is connected to a thin, inextensible, massless cord that passes through the central hole.

It is most convenient to analyze the forces on mass $m_1$ from the perspective of a non-inertial reference frame co-rotating with the turntable.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hanging mass $m_2$. Since the system is in equilibrium, the mass $m_2$ is stationary (not accelerating vertically). The forces acting on it are the gravitational force, $F_{g,2} = m_2 g$, directed downwards, and the tension in the cord, $T$, directed upwards. For vertical equilibrium of $m_2$:\n$$\n\\sum F_y = T - m_2 g = 0\n$$\nThis gives us the tension in the cord:\n$$\nT = m_2 g\n$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the forces on the puck of mass $m_1$ in the rotating reference frame. Since the puck is stationary with respect to the turntable, its velocity and acceleration in this frame are zero. The forces acting on the puck in the radial direction are:\n1.  The tension force, $T$, from the cord, pulling the puck radially inward towards the center.\n2.  The fictitious centrifugal force, $F_{cf}$, pushing the puck radially outward.\n\nThe magnitude of the centrifugal force is given by $F_{cf} = m_1 \\omega^2 r$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the axis of rotation.\n\nFor the puck to be in equilibrium in the rotating frame, the net radial force must be zero. Let's define the outward radial direction as positive.\n$$\n\\sum F_r = F_{cf} - T = 0\n$$\nThis implies that the centrifugal force must balance the tension:\n$$\nF_{cf} = T\n$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces:\n$$\nm_1 \\omega^2 r = T\n$$\n\nWe can now substitute the expression for the tension $T$ that we found from analyzing mass $m_2$:\n$$\nm_1 \\omega^2 r = m_2 g\n$$\n\nFinally, we solve for the equilibrium radius $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{m_2 g}{m_1 \\omega^{2}}\n$$\n\nIn the vertical direction for mass $m_1$, the gravitational force $m_1 g$ is balanced by the normal force from the turntable, but this information is not needed to find the radius $r$.
