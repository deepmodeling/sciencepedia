The potential energy of the particle as a function of its position $x$ is well-approximated by the function $V(x) = \\alpha(t) x^4$. The parameter $\\alpha(t)$ is directly proportional to the intensity of the trapping laser beam. Initially, the trapping parameter is constant at a value of $\\alpha_0$, and the particle is observed to be oscillating with an amplitude $A_0$. The intensity of the laser is then increased very slowly, causing the parameter $\\alpha(t)$ to change from its initial value $\\alpha_0$ to a final, higher value $\\alpha_f$. The change is adiabatic, meaning it occurs over a timescale much longer than the period of the particle's oscillation.\n\nAssuming the particle's motion remains confined to this potential, determine the new amplitude of oscillation, $A_f$, after the parameter has reached its final value $\\alpha_f$.
