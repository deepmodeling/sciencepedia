This system can exhibit both a pendulum-like swinging motion and a spring-like bouncing motion. A particularly interesting phenomenon, known as internal resonance, occurs when energy is efficiently and periodically transferred between these two modes of oscillation. This phenomenon is most pronounced when the natural frequency of the vertical bouncing motion is an integer multiple of the natural frequency of small-angle swings.\n\nConsidering the case of a 2:1 internal resonance, where the natural frequency of vertical bouncing is exactly twice the natural frequency of the pendulum-like swing, determine the required value for the spring constant $k$.
