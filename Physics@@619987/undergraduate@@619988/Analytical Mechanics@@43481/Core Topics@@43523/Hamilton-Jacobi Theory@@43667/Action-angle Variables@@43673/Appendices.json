Let the particle's position be $q$ and its momentum be $p$. The total energy of the particle is $E$, given by $E = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(q)$, where $V(q)$ is the potential energy. An important quantity for characterizing this periodic motion is the action variable, $J$, defined by the phase-space integral over one complete cycle of motion:\n$$J = \\oint p \\, dq$$\nA key experimental observation for this particular system is that the period of oscillation, $T$, is found to be completely independent of the total energy $E$ of the particle.\n\nBased on this observation, determine the functional form of the energy $E$ as a function of the action variable $J$. Express your answer in terms of $J$ and the constant period $T$.", "solution": "The problem requires us to find the functional relationship between the total energy $E$ and the action variable $J$, given that the period of oscillation $T$ is constant.\n\nFirst, let's express both the action $J$ and the period $T$ as explicit functions of energy $E$. The total energy is $E = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(q)$. We can solve for the momentum $p$:\n$$p(q, E) = \\pm \\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))}$$\nThe motion is periodic between two turning points, let's call them $q_1$ and $q_2$, where the kinetic energy is zero, i.e., $V(q_1) = V(q_2) = E$.\n\nThe action variable $J$ is defined as the integral over one complete cycle: $J = \\oint p \\, dq$. A full cycle consists of the particle moving from $q_1$ to $q_2$ with positive momentum, and then back from $q_2$ to $q_1$ with negative momentum. We can write this integral as:\n$$J(E) = \\int_{q_1}^{q_2} \\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))} \\, dq + \\int_{q_2}^{q_1} (-\\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))}) \\, dq$$\n$$J(E) = 2 \\int_{q_1(E)}^{q_2(E)} \\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))} \\, dq$$\nThis shows that $J$ is a function of $E$.\n\nNext, we express the period $T$ as a function of $E$. The velocity is $v = \\frac{p}{m} = \\frac{dq}{dt}$. We can write $dt = \\frac{dq}{v} = \\frac{m}{p} dq$. The period is the time for one full cycle:\n$$T(E) = \\oint dt = \\oint \\frac{m}{p} \\, dq$$\nSimilar to the action integral, this becomes:\n$$T(E) = 2 \\int_{q_1(E)}^{q_2(E)} \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))}} \\, dq$$\n\nNow we have expressions for both $J(E)$ and $T(E)$. To find the relationship between them, let's differentiate the action $J$ with respect to the energy $E$. The integral for $J(E)$ has limits that depend on $E$, so we must use the Leibniz integral rule:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} \\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} f(t, x) \\, dt = \\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\, dt + f(b(x), x) \\frac{db}{dx} - f(a(x), x) \\frac{da}{dx}$$\nApplying this to $J(E)$:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{dE} = 2 \\frac{d}{dE} \\int_{q_1(E)}^{q_2(E)} \\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))} \\, dq$$\n$$\\frac{dJ}{dE} = 2 \\int_{q_1}^{q_2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E}\\left(\\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))}\\right) \\, dq + 2 \\sqrt{2m(E - V(q_2))} \\frac{dq_2}{dE} - 2 \\sqrt{2m(E - V(q_1))} \\frac{dq_1}{dE}$$\nAt the turning points $q_1$ and $q_2$, by definition, $E = V(q_1)$ and $E = V(q_2)$. Therefore, the terms evaluated at the limits are zero, and the derivative simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{dE} = 2 \\int_{q_1}^{q_2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E}\\left(\\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))}\\right) \\, dq$$\nNow we compute the partial derivative of the integrand:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E}\\left(\\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m}}{2\\sqrt{E - V(q)}} = \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))}}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\frac{dJ}{dE}$:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{dE} = 2 \\int_{q_1}^{q_2} \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{2m(E - V(q))}} \\, dq$$\nWe recognize this integral as the expression for the period $T(E)$. Thus, we have found the fundamental relationship:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{dE} = T(E)$$\nThe problem states that the period $T$ is a constant, independent of energy. So, we can write:\n$$\\frac{dJ}{dE} = T$$\nWe are asked to find $E$ as a function of $J$. We can invert this relationship to get the differential equation for $E(J)$:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dJ} = \\frac{1}{T}$$\nSince $T$ is a constant, we can integrate this equation directly:\n$$\\int dE = \\int \\frac{1}{T} dJ$$\n$$E(J) = \\frac{J}{T} + C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. The action variable $J$ represents the area enclosed by the trajectory in phase space. The minimum possible energy $E_{min}$ (the bottom of the potential well) corresponds to the particle being at rest ($q=q_{min}, p=0$), which is a single point in phase space with zero area. Therefore, $J=0$ corresponds to $E=E_{min}$. We can set the zero of our energy scale such that $E_{min}=0$. With this convention, the integration constant $C$ is zero.\n\nThe functional form of the energy is therefore linear in the action variable:\n$$E = \\frac{J}{T}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{J}{T}}$$", "id": "2030823"}, {"introduction": "Having established the conceptual foundation, we now apply it to a concrete physical system.
