The planet has a mass $M$ and a radius $R$. The goal is to launch a pod of mass $m$ such that it just reaches a maximum altitude equal to the planet's radius before falling back to the surface. Assume the pod is launched from rest relative to the mass driver's mechanism at the planet's surface. Determine the initial speed, $v_0$, that must be imparted to the pod by the mass driver. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $M$, $R$, and the universal gravitational constant, $G$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the initial launch speed $v_0$ required for a pod to reach a maximum altitude of $h=R$ above the surface of a planet of mass $M$ and radius $R$. Since the planet is airless, we can neglect air resistance. The only force acting on the pod after it leaves the mass driver is the planet's gravitational force. Gravity is a conservative force, which means the total mechanical energy of the pod-planet system is conserved throughout the pod's trajectory.\n\nLet's define the total mechanical energy $E$ as the sum of the kinetic energy $K$ and the gravitational potential energy $U$. The gravitational potential energy of an object of mass $m$ at a distance $r$ from the center of a planet of mass $M$ is given by $U(r) = -\\frac{GMm}{r}$, where the potential energy is zero at an infinite distance.
