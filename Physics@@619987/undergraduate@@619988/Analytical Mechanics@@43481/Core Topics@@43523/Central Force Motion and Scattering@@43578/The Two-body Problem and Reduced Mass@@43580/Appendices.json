This is the escape velocity of the two-body system. The condition for escape is that the total mechanical energy of the system, when analyzed in the center-of-mass (CM) frame, must be zero.\n\nThe motion of a two-body system can be simplified by transforming into the CM frame.

This means the velocity vector is purely tangential, and thus perpendicular to the position vector ($\\phi = \\pi/2$). Therefore, at these two points, the magnitude of the angular momentum simplifies to:\n    $$L = \\mu r v$$\n    Since angular momentum is conserved throughout the orbit, its value at the periapsis must be equal to its value at the apoapsis.\n    $$L = \\mu r_p v_p = \\mu r_a v_a$$\n\n2.  **Relating the Ratio of Speeds to the Ratio of Distances**\n\n    From the conservation of angular momentum equation, we can establish a direct relationship between the speeds and distances at the apsides:\n    $$r_p v_p = r_a v_a$$\n    Rearranging this equation gives the ratio of the speeds:\n    $$\\frac{v_p}{v_a} = \\frac{r_a}{r_p}$$\n    This shows that the ratio of the speeds is the inverse of the ratio of their corresponding radial distances.\n\n3.  **Geometric Properties of an Elliptical Orbit**\n\n    The general equation for a conic section in polar coordinates, with the origin at one focus, is given by:\n    $$r(\\theta) = \\frac{l}{1 + e \\cos\\theta}$$\n    Here, $l$ is the semi-latus rectum, and $e$ is the eccentricity.
