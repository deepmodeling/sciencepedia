This first exercise provides a direct and intuitive entry point into this concept.

Here $E<0$, so the motion cannot reach $r=\\infty$. This can be seen directly: if the particle were to reach $r\\to\\infty$, then $U\\to 0$ and the kinetic energy would be $T=E-U\\to -\\frac{k}{r_{0}}<0$, which is impossible since $T\\ge 0$. Therefore the trajectory is not unbounded.\n\nMoreover, the particle is released from rest, so its initial angular momentum is $L=m r_{0}^{2}\\dot{\\theta}_{0}=0$. By conservation of angular momentum in a central force, $L$ remains zero, so the motion is purely radial, a collision orbit that falls inward toward $r=0$. This is a degenerate bound trajectory (it does not escape to infinity).\n\nThis classification does not depend on the mass $m$ and does not require specific numerical values of $k$ or $r_{0}$ beyond their positivity; the sign $E=-\\frac{k}{r_{0}}<0$ is fixed by the conditions given.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the orbit is bounded.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$"}, {"introduction": "To deepen our understanding, we introduce the powerful concept of the effective potential, which combines the actual potential energy with a term representing the angular momentum barrier.
