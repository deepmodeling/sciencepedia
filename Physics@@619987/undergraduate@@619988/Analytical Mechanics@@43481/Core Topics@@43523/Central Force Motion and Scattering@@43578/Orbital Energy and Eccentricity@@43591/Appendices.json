Calculate the eccentricity of the probe's orbit.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single numerical value, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the eccentricity of an elliptical orbit given the speeds at perihelion and aphelion. This can be solved by applying the principles of conservation of angular momentum and the geometric properties of an ellipse.\n\nLet $m$ be the mass of the probe. Since the gravitational force exerted by the Sun on the probe is a central force, the probe's angular momentum with respect to the Sun is conserved throughout its orbit. The magnitude of the angular momentum $L$ is given by $L = |\\vec{r} \\times (m\\vec{v})| = m|\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v}|$, where $\\vec{r}$ is the position vector from the Sun to the probe and $\\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the probe.\n\nAt the perihelion and aphelion points of an elliptical orbit, the position vector $\\vec{r}$ is perpendicular to the velocity vector $\\vec{v}$. Therefore, the magnitude of the angular momentum at these points can be written simply as $L = mrv$. Let $r_p$ and $v_p$ be the distance and speed at perihelion, and let $r_a$ and $v_a$ be the distance and speed at aphelion.\n\nBy the conservation of angular momentum, the angular momentum at perihelion must equal the angular momentum at aphelion:\n$$L_p = L_a$$\n$$m r_p v_p = m r_a v_a$$\nThe mass of the probe $m$ cancels out, yielding a relationship between the speeds and distances:\n$$r_p v_p = r_a v_a$$\nThis can be rearranged to find the ratio of the aphelion distance to the perihelion distance:\n$$\\frac{r_a}{r_p} = \\frac{v_p}{v_a}$$\n\nNext, we use the geometric definitions of the perihelion and aphelion distances for an elliptical orbit. These distances are related to the semi-major axis $a$ and the eccentricity $e$ by the following formulas:\n$$r_p = a(1 - e)$$\n$$r_a = a(1 + e)$$\n\nNow, we substitute these geometric relations into the ratio derived from the conservation of angular momentum:\n$$\\frac{a(1 + e)}{a(1 - e)} = \\frac{v_p}{v_a}$$\nThe semi-major axis $a$ cancels out:\n$$\\frac{1 + e}{1 - e} = \\frac{v_p}{v_a}$$\n\nWe can now solve this equation for the eccentricity $e$. First, we cross-multiply:\n$$v_a(1 + e) = v_p(1 - e)$$\n$$v_a + v_a e = v_p - v_p e$$\nNext, we gather the terms containing $e$ on one side of the equation and the other terms on the opposite side:\n$$v_a e + v_p e = v_p - v_a$$\nFactor out the eccentricity $e$:\n$$e(v_a + v_p) = v_p - v_a$$\nFinally, isolate $e$:\n$$e = \\frac{v_p - v_a}{v_p + v_a}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values for $v_p$ and $v_a$:\n$v_p = 4.50 \\times 10^4$ m/s\n$v_a = 2.50 \\times 10^4$ m/s\n\n$$e = \\frac{4.50 \\times 10^4 - 2.50 \\times 10^4}{4.50 \\times 10^4 + 2.50 \\times 10^4}$$\n$$e = \\frac{(4.50 - 2.50) \\times 10^4}{(4.50 + 2.50) \\times 10^4}$$\nThe factor of $10^4$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$e = \\frac{2.00}{7.00} = \\frac{2}{7}$$\n\nTo provide the final answer, we calculate the decimal value and round it to three significant figures as requested.\n$$e = \\frac{2}{7} \\approx 0.285714...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$e \\approx 0.286$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.286}$$", "id": "2068775"}, {"introduction": "In this next practice, we explore the same orbital properties but from an energetic perspective.
