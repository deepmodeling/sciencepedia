A body free to pivot will settle into a stable equilibrium when its gravitational potential energy is at a minimum. This exercise [@problem_id:2080863] provides a direct application of this principle, challenging you to determine the stable orientation of a composite L-shaped object by first locating its overall center of mass. Mastering this allows you to connect a purely geometric property—the center of mass—to a crucial physical outcome—stability.", "problem": "An L-shaped rigid lamina of uniform density is constructed from two rectangular parts made of the same material and having the same uniform width $w$. In a 2D Cartesian coordinate system, the first rectangular part occupies the region defined by $0 \\le x \\le w, 0 \\le y \\le L_1$. The second rectangular part occupies the region defined by $w \\le x \\le L_2, 0 \\le y \\le w$. The lamina is pivoted at the origin $(0,0)$ and is free to rotate in the $xy$-plane under the influence of a uniform gravitational field.\n\nDetermine the angle $\\theta$ that the longer side of the first part (the segment from $(0,0)$ to $(0,L_1)$) makes with the downward vertical direction when the lamina is in a state of stable equilibrium.

In a uniform gravitational field, a rigid body with a fixed pivot is in stable equilibrium when its center of mass lies directly below the pivot, i.e., the vector from the pivot to the center of mass is aligned with the downward vertical. Because rigid rotations preserve angles, the angle that the longer side of the first rectangle (the segment from $(0,0)$ to $(0,L_{1})$, directed along the positive $y$-axis in the body frame) makes with the downward vertical in equilibrium equals the angle between that side and the center-of-mass vector in the unrotated body frame. If $(x_{c},y_{c})$ is the center of mass of the L-shape in the given coordinates, this angle $\\theta$ satisfies $\\tan\\theta = x_{c}/y_{c}$.\n\nCompute the center of mass of the composite lamina by area-weighting the centroids of the two rectangles.
