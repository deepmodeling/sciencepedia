Both projectiles are prepared to have the exact same initial kinetic energy, $K_0$. Due to electrostatic repulsion, each projectile will slow down, come to a momentary stop at a certain distance from the gold nucleus, and then reverse its direction. This minimum separation distance is known as the distance of closest approach.\n\nLet $d_p$ be the distance of closest approach for the proton and $d_\\alpha$ be the distance of closest approach for the alpha particle.
