This first practice explores the special case of a direct, head-on collision ($b=0$) and asks for the fundamental reason behind the observed outcomes. By analyzing this scenario, you will reinforce your understanding of how conservation laws, specifically the conservation of angular momentum, provide powerful constraints on the possible trajectories of a particle in any central potential. [@problem_id:2078572]", "problem": "A particle of mass $m$ is moving with an initial velocity of magnitude $v_0$ in a region of space containing a fixed scattering center located at the origin. The scattering center exerts a central force on the particle, meaning the force vector always points along the line connecting the particle and the origin. The impact parameter, denoted by $b$, is defined as the perpendicular distance between the initial velocity vector of the particle and a parallel line passing through the origin. The scattering angle, $\\theta$, is the angle between the particle's final velocity vector (long after the interaction) and its initial velocity vector.\n\nFor the specific case of a direct, head-on approach where the impact parameter is zero ($b=0$), the particle's trajectory is observed to be restricted, resulting in a scattering angle of either $\\theta = 0$ radians (no deflection) or $\\theta = \\pi$ radians (perfect backscattering). Which of the following statements provides the most fundamental and universally applicable physical reason for this phenomenon in any central potential?\n\nA. The total mechanical energy of the particle is conserved. In a head-on collision, the only way to conserve energy is for the particle to either continue undeflected or to stop momentarily and reverse its path completely.\n\nB. The particle's initial angular momentum with respect to the scattering center is zero. Since a central force exerts no torque, angular momentum must be conserved, constraining the particle's motion to the straight line that passes through the origin.\n\nC. This observation is a unique consequence of inverse-square law forces (e.g., gravitational or electrostatic forces). For other types of central forces, scattering angles other than $0$ or $\\pi$ are possible even for a zero impact parameter.\n\nD. For a collision with zero impact parameter, the force experienced by the particle is infinite if the potential is singular at the origin, which provides an infinite impulse that can only result in perfect reflection. This does not apply to non-singular potentials where the particle passes through undeflected.\n\nE. According to Newton's second law, the force and acceleration vectors are always collinear. In a head-on collision, the force is always aligned with the velocity vector, so the particle can only speed up, slow down, or reverse, but not turn.", "solution": "In a central force field, the force on the particle is of the form $\\mathbf{F}(r) = F_{r}(r)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$, so the torque about the origin is\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\big(F_{r}(r)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\big) = \\mathbf{0},\n$$\nbecause $\\mathbf{r}$ is parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.

Hence $\\phi(t) = \\phi_{0}$ is constant and the motion is strictly radial along the fixed line through the origin. The velocity vector remains parallel or antiparallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ at all times, so the particle cannot acquire any transverse component and cannot turn away from that line.\n\nThe radial equation of motion reduces to one-dimensional motion in the central potential $V(r)$,\n$$\nm \\ddot{r} = F_{r}(r) = -\\frac{dV}{dr},\n$$\nwith no angular dynamics. Depending on $V(r)$ and the total energy, the particle either passes through (remaining along the same line with the same asymptotic direction, giving $\\theta = 0$) or is turned back along the same line (reversing its asymptotic direction, giving $\\theta = \\pi$). No other scattering angle is possible because $\\dot{\\phi} = 0$ forbids any deviation from the radial line.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental and universally applicable reason is the vanishing initial angular momentum and its conservation in a central force, which constrains the motion to a straight radial line. Energy conservation alone does not forbid transverse motion; singular behavior at the origin is not required; and the statement that force is aligned with velocity is not generally valid without first establishing that the velocity remains radial, which follows from $L=0$.\n\nHence the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2078572"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of the impact parameter, we now turn to quantifying the overall \"effectiveness\" of a target in scattering particles using the concept of a cross-section. This practice uses the most intuitive model—an impenetrable hard sphere—to help you build a concrete understanding of the total cross-section, $\\sigma_{tot}$, by connecting it directly to a familiar geometric area. This exercise provides a crucial physical intuition that is applicable even in more complex interactions.

The incident particles form a uniform, wide beam, all moving with the same initial velocity vector parallel to the z-axis.

The potential is infinite for $r\\leq R$, so the sphere is perfectly impenetrable: any particle whose straight-line trajectory intersects the sphere at $r=R$ experiences a collision and is scattered. Otherwise the trajectory remains unaltered and the particle is not scattered.\n\nFor a uniform beam directed along the $z$-axis, specify an initial condition by the impact parameter $b$, defined as the perpendicular distance from the $z$-axis to the incident trajectory at $z \\to -\\infty$.
