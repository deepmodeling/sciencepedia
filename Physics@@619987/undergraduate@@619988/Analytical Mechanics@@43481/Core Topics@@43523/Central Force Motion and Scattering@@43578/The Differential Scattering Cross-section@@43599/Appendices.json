You will explore the relationship between a projectile's energy and its distance of closest approach, a key analysis for understanding when a physical object can be approximated by a mathematical point source.", "problem": "A beam of particles is directed at a stationary target. Each particle in the beam has mass $m$ and positive charge $+q$. The target is a solid, non-conducting sphere of radius $R$ which carries a total positive charge $+Q$ distributed uniformly throughout its volume. A particle approaching the target from a large distance has an initial kinetic energy $E_0$. The interaction between a particle and the target is purely electrostatic. The electrostatic constant in a vacuum is given by $k_e = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}$, where $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\nThe standard Rutherford scattering formula accurately describes the outcome of the collision only when the projectile particle does not penetrate the target sphere. This condition is met for all possible trajectories if the incident energy $E_0$ is below a certain critical value, $E_{crit}$. For energies $E_0 > E_{crit}$, some trajectories will pass through the target sphere, and the Rutherford formula will not be universally applicable.\n\nDetermine the expression for the critical energy $E_{crit}$.

The electrostatic force between them is repulsive. According to Gauss's law, the electric field outside the uniformly charged sphere (for a radial distance $r \\ge R$) is identical to that of a point charge $+Q$ located at its center. The corresponding electrostatic potential energy of the projectile particle is $U(r) = \\frac{k_e q Q}{r}$ for $r \\ge R$.\n\nThe Rutherford scattering formula is derived based on this $1/r$ potential. Therefore, the formula is valid for a specific scattering event if and only if the projectile's trajectory remains entirely in the region where this potential applies, i.e., its distance of closest approach, $r_{min}$, satisfies $r_{min} \\ge R$. For the formula to be valid for all scattering events at a given energy $E_0$, this condition must hold for all possible impact parameters $b \\ge 0$.\n\nWe can find the relationship between $r_{min}$, $E_0$, and $b$ using the principles of conservation of energy and angular momentum. The initial kinetic energy is $E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$, where $v_0$ is the initial velocity. The angular momentum of the projectile with respect to the center of the target is $L = m v_0 b = b \\sqrt{2mE_0}$, which is conserved.\n\nAt the distance of closest approach, $r_{min}$, the radial velocity of the particle is zero. The kinetic energy at this point is purely tangential, given by $\\frac{L^2}{2mr_{min}^2}$. The total energy conservation equation is:\n$$E_0 = K_{min} + U(r_{min}) = \\frac{L^2}{2mr_{min}^2} + U(r_{min})$$\nSubstituting $L^2 = 2mE_0 b^2$ and $U(r_{min}) = \\frac{k_e q Q}{r_{min}}$:\n$$E_0 = \\frac{2mE_0 b^2}{2mr_{min}^2} + \\frac{k_e q Q}{r_{min}} = \\frac{E_0 b^2}{r_{min}^2} + \\frac{k_e q Q}{r_{min}}$$\nTo find the most restrictive condition, we need to find the minimum possible value of $r_{min}$ for any given $E_0$. We can analyze $r_{min}$ as a function of $b$. The equation can be written as $E_0 r_{min}^2 - (k_e q Q) r_{min} - E_0 b^2 = 0$. Solving this quadratic equation for $r_{min}$ gives:\n$$r_{min}(b) = \\frac{k_e q Q + \\sqrt{(k_e q Q)^2 - 4(E_0)(-E_0 b^2)}}{2E_0} = \\frac{k_e q Q + \\sqrt{(k_e q Q)^2 + 4E_0^2 b^2}}{2E_0}$$\nLooking at this expression, $r_{min}(b)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $b^2$ (or $|b|$). Thus, the minimum value of $r_{min}$ occurs at the minimum possible impact parameter, $b=0$. This corresponds to a head-on collision.\nFor $b=0$, the closest approach distance is:\n$$r_{min, min} = r_{min}(0) = \\frac{k_e q Q + \\sqrt{(k_e q Q)^2}}{2E_0} = \\frac{2k_e q Q}{2E_0} = \\frac{k_e q Q}{E_0}$$\nFor the Rutherford formula to be applicable for all trajectories, this smallest possible distance of closest approach must be greater than or equal to the sphere's radius $R$:\n$$r_{min, min} \\ge R \\implies \\frac{k_e q Q}{E_0} \\ge R$$\nThis imposes an upper limit on the incident energy: $E_0 \\le \\frac{k_e q Q}{R}$. The critical energy, $E_{crit}$, is the maximum energy for which this inequality holds.\n$$E_{crit} = \\frac{k_e q Q}{R} = \\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R}$$\nThis is the first part of the answer.\n\nFor the second part, we must calculate the differential cross-section $\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}$ when the incident energy is $E_0 = E_{crit}/2$ and the scattering angle is $\\theta = \\pi/2$.\nSince $E_0 = E_{crit}/2 < E_{crit}$, the Rutherford formula is valid. The formula is:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{k_e q Q}{4 E_0}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sin^4(\\theta/2)}$$\nWe substitute $E_0 = E_{crit}/2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{k_e q Q}{R}\\right) = \\frac{k_e q Q}{2R}$.\nThe term in the parenthesis becomes:\n$$\\frac{k_e q Q}{4 E_0} = \\frac{k_e q Q}{4 \\left(\\frac{k_e q Q}{2R}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{4/(2R)} = \\frac{2R}{4} = \\frac{R}{2}$$\nNext, we evaluate the angular term for $\\theta = \\pi/2$:\n$$\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi/2}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nTherefore, the denominator is:\n$$\\sin^4\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nCombining these results, the differential cross-section is:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{R}{2}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{1/4} = \\frac{R^2}{4} \\cdot 4 = R^2$$\nThis is the second part of the answer.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $\\left(E_{crit}, \\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 R}, R^2\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{qQ}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_{0} R} & R^{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2082799"}, {"introduction": "Not all interactions lead to scattering; some potentials can \"capture\" incident particles.
