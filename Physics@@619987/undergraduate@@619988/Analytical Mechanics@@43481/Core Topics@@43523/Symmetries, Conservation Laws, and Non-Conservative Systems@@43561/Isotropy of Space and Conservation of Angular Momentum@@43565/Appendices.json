By analyzing a hypothetical scenario involving a drone and a space station door, we can explore a system where no external torques are present, leading to the conservation of angular momentum. This practice is crucial for understanding how to calculate and apply angular momentum for both point masses and extended objects, and for distinguishing it from kinetic energy, which is not conserved in this case. [@problem_id:2061113]", "problem": "In the microgravity environment of an orbiting space station, an external airlock door is initially at rest. The door is modeled as a uniform rectangular plate of mass $M$ and width $W$. It is hinged along one of its vertical edges, allowing it to rotate freely without friction about that edge. A small, spherical maintenance drone of mass $m$ is moving with a constant velocity $v$. The drone's trajectory is in a plane perpendicular to the hinge axis. It strikes the door perpendicularly at the edge farthest from the hinge and sticks to the door upon impact. This collision is perfectly inelastic.\n\nDetermine the ratio of the final kinetic energy of the combined door-drone system to the initial kinetic energy of the drone. Express your answer as a dimensionless analytic expression in terms of $M$ and $m$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the final kinetic energy of the system to the initial kinetic energy of the drone. Let's denote the initial kinetic energy as $K_i$ and the final kinetic energy as $K_f$. We need to find the expression for the ratio $\\frac{K_f}{K_i}$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the initial state of the system, just before the collision. The door is at rest, so its kinetic energy is zero. The drone, with mass $m$ and speed $v$, has a kinetic energy given by:\n$$K_i = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2$$\n\nNext, we analyze the collision. The drone strikes the door and sticks to it. During this collision, there are no external torques acting on the door-drone system with respect to the hinge axis. The forces during the collision are internal to the system. Therefore, the angular momentum of the system about the hinge is conserved.\n\nLet's calculate the initial angular momentum of the system, $L_i$. The door is at rest, so its angular momentum is zero. The drone, treated as a point mass, has an angular momentum given by $\\vec{L} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{p}$, where $\\vec{r}$ is the position vector from the axis of rotation (the hinge) to the point of impact, and $\\vec{p} = m\\vec{v}$ is the linear momentum of the drone.\nThe drone strikes the door at the edge farthest from the hinge, so the distance is $r = W$. The velocity vector $\\vec{v}$ is perpendicular to the position vector $\\vec{r}$. Thus, the magnitude of the initial angular momentum is:\n$$L_i = r p \\sin(90^{\\circ}) = W (mv) = m v W$$\n\nNow, let's consider the final state, just after the collision. The drone is stuck to the door, and the combined system rotates with a common final angular velocity, $\\omega_f$, about the hinge. The final angular momentum of the system, $L_f$, is given by:\n$$L_f = I_f \\omega_f$$\nwhere $I_f$ is the total moment of inertia of the combined system about the hinge.\n\nThe total moment of inertia $I_f$ is the sum of the moment of inertia of the door, $I_{door}$, and the moment of inertia of the drone, $I_{drone}$, both calculated about the hinge axis.\nThe door is a uniform rectangular plate of mass $M$ and width $W$ rotating about one of its edges. The moment of inertia for this configuration is:\n$$I_{door} = \\frac{1}{3} M W^2$$\nThe drone is treated as a point mass $m$ at a distance $W$ from the axis of rotation. Its moment of inertia is:\n$$I_{drone} = m W^2$$\nTherefore, the total final moment of inertia is:\n$$I_f = I_{door} + I_{drone} = \\frac{1}{3} M W^2 + m W^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} M + m\\right) W^2$$\n\nBy the principle of conservation of angular momentum, $L_i = L_f$:\n$$m v W = \\left(\\frac{1}{3} M + m\\right) W^2 \\omega_f$$\nWe can solve this equation for the final angular velocity $\\omega_f$:\n$$\\omega_f = \\frac{m v W}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3} M + m\\right) W^2} = \\frac{m v}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3} M + m\\right) W}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the final kinetic energy of the system, $K_f$. Since the system is undergoing pure rotation about the hinge, its kinetic energy is given by:\n$$K_f = \\frac{1}{2} I_f \\omega_f^2$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_f$ and $\\omega_f$:\n$$K_f = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{3} M + m\\right) W^2 \\right] \\left[ \\frac{m v}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3} M + m\\right) W} \\right]^2$$\n$$K_f = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} M + m\\right) W^2 \\frac{m^2 v^2}{\\left(\\frac{1}{3} M + m\\right)^2 W^2}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling terms:\n$$K_f = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m^2 v^2}{\\frac{1}{3} M + m}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the desired ratio $\\frac{K_f}{K_i}$:\n$$\\frac{K_f}{K_i} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m^2 v^2}{\\frac{1}{3} M + m}}{\\frac{1}{2} m v^2}$$\nThe terms $\\frac{1}{2}$, $m$, and $v^2$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{K_f}{K_i} = \\frac{m}{\\frac{1}{3} M + m}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 3:\n$$\\frac{K_f}{K_i} = \\frac{3m}{M + 3m}$$\nThis is the final dimensionless expression for the ratio of the final kinetic energy to the initial kinetic energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3m}{M + 3m}}$$", "id": "2061113"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a discrete event to a continuous process, this problem challenges us to apply the principle of angular momentum conservation to a system with changing mass.
