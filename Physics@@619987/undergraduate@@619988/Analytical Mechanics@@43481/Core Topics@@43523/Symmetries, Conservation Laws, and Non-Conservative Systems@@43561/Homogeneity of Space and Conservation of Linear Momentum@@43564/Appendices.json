This first exercise provides a concrete application of this principle within the Lagrangian framework for a single particle. By analyzing a particle moving under a spatially dependent, non-conservative force, you will learn to use Lagrange's equations with generalized forces to determine which components of linear momentum are conserved, directly linking the properties of the system's dynamics to fundamental conservation laws [@problem_id:2057806]. This practice serves as a foundational step in understanding how symmetries, or the lack thereof, dictate the motion of physical systems.", "problem": "A particle of mass $m$ is constrained to move on a two-dimensional Cartesian plane ($xy$-plane). It is subject to a spatially varying force given by the vector field $\\vec{F} = -k y \\hat{i}$, where $k$ is a positive constant, $\\hat{i}$ is the unit vector in the $x$-direction, and $y$ is the particle's coordinate along the $y$-axis.
