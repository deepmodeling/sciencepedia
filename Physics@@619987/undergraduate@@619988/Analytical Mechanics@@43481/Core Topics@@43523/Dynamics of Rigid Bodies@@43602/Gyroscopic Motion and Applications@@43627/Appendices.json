The basketball has a mass $m$ and radius $R$. For this problem, you should model the basketball as a thin-walled hollow sphere. The ball is spinning with a constant angular speed $\\omega_s$ about an axis passing through its center. The player holds the spin axis at a constant angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical. To prevent the basketball from precessing around the vertical axis, the player must apply a torque. Assuming the finger provides a single point of support on the basketball's surface, determine the magnitude of the torque the player's finger must exert on the ball to keep its orientation fixed. Your answer should be an expression in terms of $m$, $R$, $\\theta$, and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$.", "solution": "Let the single point of contact between the finger and the basketball act as a fixed pivot in space. The center of mass is a distance $R$ from this pivot, along the spin axis; the axis is held at a constant angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical.
