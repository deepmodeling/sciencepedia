Express your answer as a scalar in terms of $g$, taking the upward direction as positive.", "solution": "To determine the acceleration of the yo-yo's center of mass, we apply Newton's Second Law for translational motion. The motion of the center of mass is governed solely by the net external force acting on the object.\n\nLet's define the upward direction as the positive vertical direction. The forces acting on the yo-yo are:\n1.  The force of gravity, $\\vec{F}_g$, acting downward. Its magnitude is $Mg$. In our coordinate system, this force is $-Mg$.\n2.  The tension force from the string, $\\vec{T}$, acting upward. Its magnitude is $T$. In our coordinate system, this force is $+T$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the string is pulled with a constant force of magnitude $F = \\frac{1}{2}Mg$. As the string is assumed to be light (massless), the tension is uniform throughout the string. Therefore, the tension force exerted on the yo-yo is equal to the pulling force:\n$$T = F = \\frac{1}{2}Mg$$\n\nNow, we write Newton's Second Law for the translational motion of the center of mass ($a_{cm}$):\n$$\\sum F_{y} = M a_{cm}$$\nThe net force in the vertical direction is the sum of the tension and the gravitational force:\n$$T - Mg = M a_{cm}$$\n\nSubstitute the expression for the tension $T$ into the equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}Mg - Mg = M a_{cm}$$\n\nNow, we simplify the left side of the equation:\n$$-\\frac{1}{2}Mg = M a_{cm}$$\n\nFinally, we solve for the acceleration of the center of mass, $a_{cm}$, by dividing both sides by the mass $M$:\n$$a_{cm} = -\\frac{1}{2}g$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the acceleration vector points downward. The magnitude of the acceleration is $\\frac{1}{2}g$.\n\nIt is important to note that while the tension force also creates a torque ($\\tau = TR$) that causes the yo-yo to rotate, the rotational dynamics are not needed to find the linear acceleration of the center of mass. The linear motion of the center of mass depends only on the net external force, not on where the forces are applied.
