For a system of discrete point masses, the moment of inertia is calculated by summing the product of each mass and the square of its perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation. The formula is $I = \\sum_{i} m_i r_i^2$.\n\nThe system consists of three identical masses, so $m_1 = m_2 = m_3 = m$. Let's label the spheres 1, 2, and 3. The problem states that the axis of rotation passes through the center of one of the spheres. We can choose this to be sphere 1 without loss of generality.\n\nThe distance of sphere 1 from the axis of rotation is therefore $r_1 = 0$.\n\nThe spheres are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side length $s$. The distance from sphere 1 (through which the axis passes) to sphere 2 is the side length of the triangle. Thus, the distance of sphere 2 from the axis of rotation is $r_2 = s$.\n\nSimilarly, the distance from sphere 1 to sphere 3 is also the side length of the triangle. The distance of sphere 3 from the axis of rotation is $r_3 = s$.\n\nNow we can calculate the total moment of inertia $I$ of the system about this axis:\n$$I = m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2 + m_3 r_3^2$$\nSubstituting the masses and their respective distances:\n$$I = m(0)^2 + m(s)^2 + m(s)^2$$\n$$I = 0 + ms^2 + ms^2$$\n$$I = 2ms^2$$\n\nWith the moment of inertia calculated, we can now find the rotational kinetic energy using the formula $K = \\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^2$.\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2} (2ms^2) \\omega^2$$\n$$K = ms^2 \\omega^2$$\n\nTherefore, the total rotational kinetic energy of the system is $ms^2 \\omega^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ms^{2}\\omega^{2}}$$", "id": "2077952"}, {"introduction": "Real-world problems often involve continuous objects rotating about an off-center axis, a scenario not covered by standard formulas for rotation about the center of mass.
