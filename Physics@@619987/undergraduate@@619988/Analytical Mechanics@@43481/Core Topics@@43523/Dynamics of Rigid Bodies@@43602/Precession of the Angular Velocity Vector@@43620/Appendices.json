It is observed that the gyroscope undergoes steady precession, where the axle maintains a constant angle $\\theta$ with the vertical axis and rotates about this vertical axis with a constant angular frequency $\\Omega$. The center of mass of the disk is therefore moving in a horizontal circle.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the vertical component of the force exerted by the pivot on the axle.

[@problem_id:2073997]", "problem": "A gyroscopic balancing system is composed of a rigid, massless rod of length $L$. Two identical, uniform solid disks, each of mass $M$ and radius $R$, are mounted on the ends of the rod. The center of each disk is at a distance of $L/2$ from the rod's midpoint, and the rod is aligned with the axis of symmetry of each disk. The entire assembly is suspended by a frictionless pivot at the rod's midpoint, which allows for free rotation in three dimensions.\n\nInitially, the rod is held stationary in a horizontal orientation. The disks are set to spin at a high angular speed $\\omega_s$ relative to the rod. The disk at one end is spinning clockwise when viewed from its end of the rod looking towards the pivot.

Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $M, m, R, L,$ and $g$.", "solution": "The solution proceeds by first analyzing the torques and angular momenta involved, and then applying the rotational equation of motion.\n\n**Step 1: Establish a coordinate system.**\nLet the frictionless pivot be at the origin $(0,0,0)$. Let the rod be initially aligned with the x-axis, so the centers of the two disks are at $\\vec{r}_1 = (L/2)\\hat{i}$ and $\\vec{r}_2 = (-L/2)\\hat{i}$. Gravity acts in the negative z-direction, so $\\vec{g} = -g\\hat{k}$. The payload mass $m$ is attached at the position of one disk; let's choose $\\vec{r}_1 = (L/2)\\hat{i}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total spin angular momentum.**\nThe problem states that the disk at one end spins clockwise when viewed from its end towards the pivot. Let's consider the disk at $\\vec{r}_1 = (L/2)\\hat{i}$. Viewing from this point towards the pivot means looking in the $-\\hat{i}$ direction. A clockwise spin corresponds to an angular momentum vector pointing along the line of sight, so its spin angular momentum is $\\vec{L}_{s,1} = -I_s \\omega_s \\hat{i}$.\nFor the disk at $\\vec{r}_2 = (-L/2)\\hat{i}$, viewing from this point towards the pivot means looking in the $+\\hat{i}$ direction. A clockwise spin corresponds to an angular momentum vector pointing in the $+\\hat{i}$ direction, so its spin angular momentum is $\\vec{L}_{s,2} = +I_s \\omega_s \\hat{i}$.\nThe total spin angular momentum of the system is the sum of the two:\n$$ \\vec{L}_{\\text{spin}} = \\vec{L}_{s,1} + \\vec{L}_{s,2} = -I_s \\omega_s \\hat{i} + I_s \\omega_s \\hat{i} = \\vec{0} $$\nSince the disks spin relative to the rod, and their axes are fixed along the rod, this condition $\\vec{L}_{\\text{spin}} = \\vec{0}$ holds true even as the rod rotates. Therefore, the time derivative of the total spin angular momentum is also zero: $\\frac{d\\vec{L}_{\\text{spin}}}{dt} = \\vec{0}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the net external torque.**\nThe external forces acting on the system are gravity on the two disks and the payload, and the pivot force. The torque is calculated about the pivot (origin), so the pivot force creates no torque. The gravitational forces are:\n- On disk 1 (mass $M$): $\\vec{F}_{g,1} = M\\vec{g} = -Mg\\hat{k}$ acting at $\\vec{r}_1 = (L/2)\\hat{i}$.\n- On disk 2 (mass $M$): $\\vec{F}_{g,2} = M\\vec{g} = -Mg\\hat{k}$ acting at $\\vec{r}_2 = (-L/2)\\hat{i}$.\n- On payload (mass $m$): $\\vec{F}_{g,m} = m\\vec{g} = -mg\\hat{k}$ acting at $\\vec{r}_1 = (L/2)\\hat{i}$.\n\nThe net torque $\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}}$ is the sum of the torques from these forces:\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}} = \\vec{r}_1 \\times \\vec{F}_{g,1} + \\vec{r}_2 \\times \\vec{F}_{g,2} + \\vec{r}_1 \\times \\vec{F}_{g,m} $$\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\hat{i}\\right) \\times (-Mg\\hat{k}) + \\left(-\\frac{L}{2}\\hat{i}\\right) \\times (-Mg\\hat{k}) + \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\hat{i}\\right) \\times (-mg\\hat{k}) $$\nUsing the cross product identity $\\hat{i} \\times \\hat{k} = -\\hat{j}$:\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}} = \\frac{LMg}{2}(-\\hat{j}) - \\frac{LMg}{2}(-\\hat{j}) + \\frac{Lmg}{2}(-\\hat{j}) = -\\frac{LMg}{2}\\hat{j} + \\frac{LMg}{2}\\hat{j} - \\frac{mgL}{2}\\hat{j} = -\\frac{mgL}{2}\\hat{j} $$\nThe torque calculation if the mass was attached at the other end would yield $\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}} = +\\frac{mgL}{2}\\hat{j}$. The magnitude is the same.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the rotational equation of motion.**\nThe general equation is $\\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}} = \\frac{d\\vec{L}_{\\text{total}}}{dt}$. The total angular momentum is $\\vec{L}_{\\text{total}} = \\vec{L}_{\\text{orbital}} + \\vec{L}_{\\text{spin}}$. Since $\\frac{d\\vec{L}_{\\text{spin}}}{dt} = 0$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}} = \\frac{d\\vec{L}_{\\text{orbital}}}{dt} $$\nFor a rigid body rotating with angular velocity $\\vec{\\Omega}$, the rate of change of orbital angular momentum is given by $\\frac{d\\vec{L}_{\\text{orbital}}}{dt} = \\mathbf{I}\\vec{\\alpha} + \\vec{\\Omega} \\times (\\mathbf{I}\\vec{\\Omega})$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the moment of inertia tensor and $\\vec{\\alpha} = d\\vec{\\Omega}/dt$ is the angular acceleration. The system is released from rest, so at $t=0$, the angular velocity $\\vec{\\Omega}(0) = \\vec{0}$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext}}(0) = \\mathbf{I}(0)\\vec{\\alpha}(0) $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the moment of inertia tensor.**\nWe need the moment of inertia tensor $\\mathbf{I}$ for the entire assembly (two disks + payload) about the pivot. In our chosen coordinate system, the body is symmetric with respect to the coordinate planes, so the off-diagonal terms are zero. We only need the diagonal components $I_{xx}, I_{yy}, I_{zz}$. We use the parallel axis theorem.\nThe components are $I_{ab} = \\sum_i (I_{i, ab, cm} + m_i(\\delta_{ab} r_i^2 - r_{i,a}r_{i,b}))$.\n$I_{xx} = \\sum m_i(y_i^2 + z_i^2)$ for point masses. For extended bodies, we add the CM moments of inertia about the x-axis.\nThe disks are located at $(\\pm L/2, 0, 0)$ and their spin axes are along the x-axis.\n$I_{xx} = I_{s,1} + I_{s,2} = I_s + I_s = 2I_s = MR^2$.\n$I_{yy} = \\sum (I_{i, yy, cm} + m_i(x_i^2+z_i^2))$. For both disks, the relevant moment of inertia about their CM is the transverse one, $I_t$.\n$I_{yy} = [I_t + M(L/2)^2] + [I_t + M(L/2)^2] + [0 + m(L/2)^2] = 2I_t + 2M(L/2)^2 + m(L/2)^2$.\n$I_{yy} = 2I_t + (2M+m)\\frac{L^2}{4}$.\nSince the system is symmetric about the x-axis, $I_{zz} = I_{yy}$.\nSubstituting $I_t = \\frac{1}{4}MR^2$:\n$$I_{yy} = I_{zz} = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}MR^2\\right) + (2M+m)\\frac{L^2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}MR^2 + (2M+m)\\frac{L^2}{4}$$\n\n**Step 6: Solve for the initial angular acceleration.**\nWe write $\\vec{\\tau} = \\mathbf{I}\\vec{\\alpha}$ in component form, with $\\vec{\\alpha} = (\\alpha_x, \\alpha_y, \\alpha_z)$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\tau_x \\\\ \\tau_y \\\\ \\tau_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} I_{xx} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & I_{yy} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & I_{zz} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_x \\\\ \\alpha_y \\\\ \\alpha_z \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\beginpmatrix} 0 \\\\ -mgL/2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} I_{xx} \\alpha_x \\\\ I_{yy} \\alpha_y \\\\ I_{zz} \\alpha_z \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives three independent equations:\n$I_{xx}\\alpha_x = 0 \\implies \\alpha_x = 0$ (since $I_{xx} \\neq 0$).\n$I_{zz}\\alpha_z = 0 \\implies \\alpha_z = 0$ (since $I_{zz} \\neq 0$).\n$I_{yy}\\alpha_y = -mgL/2 \\implies \\alpha_y = -\\frac{mgL/2}{I_{yy}}$.\n\nThe initial angular acceleration vector is $\\vec{\\alpha}(0) = \\alpha_y \\hat{j}$.\nSubstitute the expression for $I_{yy}$:\n$$ \\vec{\\alpha}(0) = -\\frac{mgL/2}{\\frac{1}{2}MR^2 + (2M+m)\\frac{L^2}{4}}\\hat{j} $$\n\n**Step 7: Find the magnitude.**\nThe magnitude of the initial angular acceleration is the absolute value of $\\alpha_y$:\n$$ |\\vec{\\alpha}(0)| = \\frac{mgL/2}{\\frac{1}{2}MR^2 + (2M+m)\\frac{L^2}{4}} $$\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by 4:\n$$ |\\vec{\\alpha}(0)| = \\frac{2mgL}{2MR^2 + (2M+m)L^2} $$\nThis is the final expression. Note that it is independent of the spin speed $\\omega_s$, a consequence of the total spin angular momentum being zero.
