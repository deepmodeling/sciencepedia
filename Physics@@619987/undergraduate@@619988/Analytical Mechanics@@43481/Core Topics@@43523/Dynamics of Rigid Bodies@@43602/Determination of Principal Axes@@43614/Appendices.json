The origin $O$ of the coordinate system is located at the center of the cylinder's base. The $z$-axis aligns with the cylinder's axis of rotational symmetry, pointing into the cylinder's volume. Consequently, the cylinder occupies the spatial region defined by $x^2+y^2 \\le R^2$ and $0 \\le z \\le H$.\n\nThe principal axes of inertia with respect to the origin $O$ are a set of three mutually orthogonal axes for which the products of inertia of the cylinder vanish.

The inertia tensor is\n$$\nI_{ij}=\\int_{V}\\rho\\left(\\delta_{ij} r^{2}-x_{i}x_{j}\\right)\\,dV,\n$$\nwhich is a real symmetric tensor and therefore diagonalizable by an orthonormal set of eigenvectors (the principal axes).\n\nBy rotational symmetry of the cylinder about the $z$-axis (the volume and mass density are invariant under any rotation in the $x$–$y$ plane):\n- The tensor must satisfy $I_{xx}=I_{yy}$.\n- The off-diagonal entries coupling the $x$–$y$ plane vanish: $I_{xy}=0$.\n- Invariance under rotations about $z$ also forces $I_{xz}=I_{yz}=0$.\n\nTherefore, in the standard Cartesian basis, the inertia tensor has the diagonal form\n$$\nI=\\begin{pmatrix}\nI_{xx} & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & I_{yy} & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & I_{zz}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\\text{with}\\quad I_{xx}=I_{yy}.\n$$\nHence, the $z$-axis is a principal axis, and the entire $x$–$y$ plane is a degenerate eigenspace: any orthonormal pair of directions within the $x$–$y$ plane forms principal axes. This already implies that a valid set of principal axes consists of the $z$-axis together with any two mutually orthogonal directions in the $x$–$y$ plane.\n\nTo confirm that $I_{zz}$ is generally distinct from $I_{xx}=I_{yy}$ for this origin, use the parallel-axis theorem from the cylinder’s center of mass (at $(0,0,H/2)$) to $O$. For a solid cylinder, the moments about centroidal axes are\n$$\nI_{\\text{CM},xx}=I_{\\text{CM},yy}=\\frac{1}{12}M\\left(3R^{2}+H^{2}\\right),\\qquad\nI_{\\text{CM},zz}=\\frac{1}{2}MR^{2}.\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{d}=(0,0,H/2)$ be the displacement from $O$ to the center of mass.

Consequently, the $z$-axis is the unique (nondegenerate) principal axis, and the principal subspace in the $x$–$y$ plane is two-dimensional; any orthonormal basis within this plane is valid, and products of inertia vanish in any such rotated basis because the $x$–$y$ block is proportional to the identity.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A: $\\{(1,1,0),(-1,1,0),(0,0,1)\\}$. The first two vectors lie in the $x$–$y$ plane and are orthogonal to each other; the third is along the $z$-axis.

Since $I_{xx}\\neq I_{zz}$, such mixtures are not eigenvectors; thus not principal axes.\n- C: $\\{(1,0,0),(1,1,0),(0,0,1)\\}$. These are not mutually orthogonal because $(1,0,0)\\cdot(1,1,0)\\neq 0$, so they cannot be principal axes.\n- D: $\\{(1,1,1),(1,-1,0),(1,1,-2)\\}$. These are mutually orthogonal, but two axes mix the $z$-component with the $x$–$y$ plane. With $I_{xx}\\neq I_{zz}$, they are not eigenvectors; hence not principal axes.\n- E: $\\{(1,0,0),(0,1,1),(0,-1,1)\\}$. These are mutually orthogonal, but two axes mix $y$ and $z$.

This advanced problem [@problem_id:2046163] challenges you to determine the principal axes for a cube with a non-trivial mass density.

The first column of the matrix must be the principal axis vector that lies along the aforementioned main diagonal. The second column vector must be chosen to have a zero z-component.", "solution": "The principal axes of a rigid body are the eigenvectors of its inertia tensor, $I$. A key principle in mechanics is that if a body's mass distribution is invariant under a symmetry operation, its inertia tensor must commute with the matrix representation of that symmetry. This implies that the inertia tensor and the symmetry operator can be simultaneously diagonalized, meaning the principal axes must also be eigenvectors of the symmetry operator. We will use this principle to find the principal axes without explicitly calculating the inertia tensor.\n\nLet the coordinate system be centered at the cube's center, with axes parallel to the edges. The position vector of a point is $\\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)$. The main diagonal in question is aligned with the vector $\\mathbf{u} = (1, 1, 1)$. The unit vector along this diagonal is $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(1, 1, 1)$. The mass density is given as $\\rho(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto d^2$, where $d$ is the perpendicular distance from $\\mathbf{r}$ to the line defined by $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$. The density is thus a function only of the perpendicular distance to this axis.\n\n**Symmetry Analysis**\n\n1.  **Rotational Symmetry about the Main Diagonal:** Consider a rotation by an angle of $120^\\circ$ ($2\\pi/3$ radians) about the axis $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$. This operation, denoted as $C_3$, maps the cube onto itself (it permutes the vertices, edges, and faces). For instance, it maps the x-axis to the y-axis, y-axis to the z-axis, and z-axis to the x-axis. The matrix representation for this specific $C_3$ rotation is:\n    $$\n    R_{C_3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    Since the density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ only depends on the perpendicular distance to the axis of rotation, it is also invariant under this rotation. Therefore, the entire mass distribution is symmetric under this $C_3$ rotation. This means the inertia tensor $I$ must commute with $R_{C_3}$, i.e., $[I, R_{C_3}] = 0$.\n\n    One immediate consequence is that the axis of rotation, $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$, must be an eigenvector of $I$, and thus a principal axis. This is because any vector on the axis of a non-trivial rotation is an eigenvector of that rotation matrix (with eigenvalue 1). Since $I$ commutes with $R_{C_3}$, and $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}$ is a non-degenerate eigenvector of $R_{C_3}$, it must also be an eigenvector of $I$.\n\n    So, the first principal axis is $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_1 = \\mathbf{\\hat{n}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(1, 1, 1)$.\n\n2.  **Degeneracy and Perpendicular Axes:** The other two principal axes must be orthogonal to $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_1$. They lie in the plane perpendicular to $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_1$, which is defined by the equation $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_1 = 0$, or $x+y+z=0$. The eigenvalues corresponding to these two axes are degenerate because of the $C_3$ rotational symmetry. This means any pair of orthogonal vectors in this plane can serve as principal axes. However, the cube has additional symmetries that can resolve this ambiguity.\n\n3.  **Reflectional Symmetry:** Consider a reflection through the plane $x=y$. The matrix for this operation is:\n    $$\n    P_{xy} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    This operation maps the cube to itself. Let's check if the mass distribution is also symmetric. The transformation is $(x,y,z) \\to (y,x,z)$. The density depends on $d^2 = |\\mathbf{r}|^2 - (\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n}})^2$.\n    $|\\mathbf{r}|^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2$ is invariant under the swap $x \\leftrightarrow y$.\n    $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{n}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(x+y+z)$ is also invariant.\n    Therefore, the density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$ is invariant under this reflection. The inertia tensor $I$ must commute with $P_{xy}$, so $[I, P_{xy}]=0$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Remaining Axes:** The remaining two principal axes must be eigenvectors of $I$ lying in the plane $x+y+z=0$. Since $[I, P_{xy}]=0$, we can choose these principal axes to also be eigenvectors of the reflection operator $P_{xy}$. Let's find the eigenvectors of $P_{xy}$.\n    $$\n    P_{xy} \\mathbf{v} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} v_y \\\\ v_x \\\\ v_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\\\ v_z \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    This gives the system of equations: $v_y = \\lambda v_x$, $v_x = \\lambda v_y$, and $v_z = \\lambda v_z$.\n    The equation $v_x = \\lambda v_y = \\lambda^2 v_x$ implies $\\lambda^2=1$, so the eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\pm 1$.\n\n    -   **Case $\\lambda=1$:** The eigenvector condition is $v_y=v_x$. The vector is of the form $(c, c, d)$.\n    -   **Case $\\lambda=-1$**: The eigenvector condition is $v_y=-v_x$. The vector is of the form $(c, -c, d)$.\n\n    We are seeking vectors that satisfy these conditions *and* lie in the plane $x+y+z=0$.\n\n    -   Let's find the principal axis that is an eigenvector of $P_{xy}$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda=-1$. The vector must be of the form $(c, -c, d)$ and must satisfy $x+y+z=0$.\n        $c + (-c) + d = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n        So the vector direction is $(c, -c, 0)$, which simplifies to $(1, -1, 0)$. Normalizing this gives the second principal axis:\n        $$\n        \\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2+0^2}}(1, -1, 0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, -1, 0)\n        $$\n        This vector satisfies the problem's constraint of having a zero z-component.\n\n    -   The third principal axis, $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_3$, must be orthogonal to both $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_1$ and $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_2$. We can find it using the cross product: $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_3 \\propto \\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_1 \\times \\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_2$.\n        $$\n        (1, 1, 1) \\times (1, -1, 0) = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = (1, 1, -2)\n        $$\n        Normalizing this vector gives the third principal axis:\n        $$\n        \\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2+1^2+(-2)^2}}(1, 1, -2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(1, 1, -2)\n        $$\n        This third axis corresponds to the eigenvector of $P_{xy}$ with $\\lambda=1$ that also lies in the $x+y+z=0$ plane. A vector of the form $(c,c,d)$ with $c+c+d=0$ gives $d=-2c$, so the direction is $(c,c,-2c)$ or $(1,1,-2)$, which matches our result.\n\n**Constructing the Final Matrix**\nWe now assemble the 3x3 matrix as requested.\n- Column 1: $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(1, 1, 1)$\n- Column 2: $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1, -1, 0)$\n- Column 3: $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}_3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}(1, 1, -2)$\n\nThe resulting matrix is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} & 0 & -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} & 0 & -\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2046163"}]}
