The initial design is a perfect, uniform cube. For attitude control reasons, the design is modified by machining the cube into a rectangular prism.

The final dimensions of the prism along the x, y, and z axes are measured to be $d_x = 0.485$ m, $d_y = 0.500$ m, and $d_z = 0.515$ m, respectively.\n\nThe satellite will be deployed in a zero-gravity environment and spun up to a constant rotation rate. The spin is intended to be about one of its principal axes of inertia.

By the intermediate axis theorem, rotation about this axis is unstable to small perturbations, whereas rotation about the axes with $I_{x}$ (largest) and $I_{z}$ (smallest) is stable.

This exercise highlights that rotational stability is guaranteed unless a *unique* intermediate axis exists.", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, conceptualized as a system of two distinct point masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, connected by a rigid, massless rod of fixed length $L$. The system is isolated in space, experiencing no external forces or torques. For this analysis, set the masses to be $m_1 = m$ and $m_2 = 3m$.\n\nThe stability of a rigid body's rotational motion is determined by its principal moments of inertia, typically ordered as $I_1 \\ge I_2 \\ge I_3$, calculated with respect to the body's center of mass (CM). For a body with three distinct principal moments of inertia ($I_1 > I_2 > I_3$), it is a standard result that torque-free rotation is stable when initiated about the axes corresponding to the largest ($I_1$) and smallest ($I_3$) moments, but unstable when initiated about the axis of the intermediate moment ($I_2$).\n\nYour task is to analyze the rotational stability for the given two-mass system. First, identify the principal axes and calculate the corresponding principal moments of inertia about the system's center of mass.

Rotation is unstable about all three principal axes.\n\nD. Rotation is stable about all three principal axes.\n\nE. Due to a principal moment of inertia being zero, the system cannot undergo stable rotation about any axis.", "solution": "Place the two point masses on the $x$-axis with the rod along $x$ and the center of mass (CM) at the origin. Let $m_{1}=m$ be at position $x_{1}$ and $m_{2}=3m$ at position $x_{2}$, with $x_{2}-x_{1}=L$ and the CM condition $m_{1}x_{1}+m_{2}x_{2}=0$.

Ordering the moments gives\n$$\nI_{1}=I_{2}=\\frac{3}{4}mL^{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad I_{3}=0,\n$$\nso there is a doubly degenerate maximum and a strict minimum, with no distinct intermediate moment.\n\nFor torque-free rotation of a rigid body, rotation about axes corresponding to the largest and smallest principal moments is stable, while rotation about the intermediate moment (when distinct) is unstable. In this system the degeneracy removes the intermediate axis: we have only the extremal cases (maximum and minimum). Therefore, torque-free rotations about either of the perpendicular principal axes (the maxima) are stable, and rotation about the rod axis (the minimum) is also stable. Although $I_{3}=0$ implies that ideal point masses on the rod do not contribute kinetic energy for spin about the rod, this corresponds to a neutrally stable (trivially stable) rotation, and does not introduce an instability.\n\nHence, rotation is stable about all three principal axes for this system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2080587"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice challenge [@problem_id:2080605] moves from direct calculation to conceptual reasoning, revealing the profound link between symmetry and rotational stability.
