This implies two conditions must be met:\n1.  The matrix must be orthogonal, meaning it preserves lengths and angles. This corresponds to the \"rigid\" and \"no scaling\" requirement. Mathematically, an orthogonal matrix satisfies the condition $A^T A = I$, where $A^T$ is the transpose of $A$ and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n2.  The matrix must have a determinant of +1.

This gives us the equation:\n$$2c^2 = 1$$\n\nNext, let's impose the determinant condition, $\\det(A) = 1$. The determinant of matrix $A$ is:\n$$\\det(A) = (c)(c) - (c)(-c) = c^2 + c^2 = 2c^2$$\nSetting the determinant equal to 1 gives us the equation:\n$$2c^2 = 1$$\n\nBoth conditions independently lead to the same equation for $c$.
