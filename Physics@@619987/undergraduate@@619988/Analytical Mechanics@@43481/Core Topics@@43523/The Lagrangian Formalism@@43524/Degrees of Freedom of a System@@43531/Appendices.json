Consider a composite system made up of three distinct and non-interacting sub-systems, labeled A, B, and C. Your task is to determine the total number of degrees of freedom for this composite system based on the descriptions below.\n\n**System A:** A single point mass, representing an atom of a monatomic gas, moving freely in three-dimensional space.\n\n**System B:** A model of a linear molecule (such as carbon dioxide, CO2), which consists of three point masses arranged in a fixed straight line. The distances between adjacent masses are constant. This entire rigid structure moves freely in three-dimensional space.\n\n**System C:** A rigid, flat, square-shaped frame made of four point masses at its vertices.

However, because the molecule is strictly linear (all masses collinear), rotation about its own axis leaves the configuration invariant, so only two independent rotational parameters remain (the orientation of a line in space is set by two angles). Therefore,\n$$\nf_{B}=3+2=5.\n$$\n\nFor system C (a rigid square frame constrained to move in a plane), a planar rigid body has $2$ translational DOF within the plane and $1$ rotational DOF about the axis perpendicular to the plane, giving\n$$\nf_{C}=2+1=3.\n$$\n\nSince the subsystems are distinct and non-interacting, the total DOF is the sum:\n$$\nf_{\\text{tot}}=f_{A}+f_{B}+f_{C}=3+5+3=11.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11}$$", "id": "2044818"}, {"introduction": "Having established the basics, we now examine a system where components are kinematically linked, introducing the crucial role of constraints. This classic problem [@problem_id:2044803] of a bead sliding on a constrained rod is an excellent hands-on application of the general formula for degrees of freedom, $DOF = N - k$, where $N$ is the total number of coordinates and $k$ is the number of independent holonomic constraints.

The two ends of the rod must always remain in contact with the positive x-axis and the positive y-axis, respectively. A small bead is threaded onto the rod and is free to slide along its entire length.\n\nDetermine the total number of degrees of freedom for the combined system consisting of the rod and the bead. The final answer should be a single real number.", "solution": "Let the endpoint of the rod on the positive x-axis be at $(a,0)$ and the endpoint on the positive y-axis be at $(0,b)$ with $a>0$ and $b>0$. The rod is rigid with fixed length $L$, so the distance between its endpoints is fixed:\n$$\n(a-0)^{2}+(0-b)^{2}=L^{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a^{2}+b^{2}=L^{2}.\n$$\nThus, among the two variables $a$ and $b$, there is one holonomic constraint, leaving the rod itself with a single degree of freedom.\n\nIntroduce a bead that can slide along the rod. Define a generalized coordinate $s\\in[0,L]$ measuring the arclength from the x-axis contact point $(a,0)$ along the rod toward the y-axis contact point $(0,b)$. The bead’s position is then determined by\n$$\n(x_{b},y_{b})=(a,0)+\\frac{s}{L}\\big((0,b)-(a,0)\\big)=\\left(a\\left(1-\\frac{s}{L}\\right),\\frac{b s}{L}\\right).\n$$\nThis introduces one additional independent generalized coordinate $s$.\n\nTherefore, the full configuration of the system can be described by the three variables $(a,b,s)$ subject to the single holonomic constraint $a^{2}+b^{2}=L^{2}$. Inequalities $a>0$, $b>0$, and $0\\leq s\\leq L$ restrict the domain but do not reduce the dimensionality. Hence, the total number of degrees of freedom is\n$$\n3-1=2.\n$$\n\nAs a consistency check, a planar rigid body has $3$ degrees of freedom; constraining one endpoint to lie on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis imposes $2$ independent holonomic constraints, leaving $1$ for the rod.

A frictionless hinge (planar revolute joint) between two bodies imposes two independent scalar constraints (coincidence of the hinge point in both bodies), leaving one relative degree of freedom at that joint. For a free-floating assembly of $N$ planar rigid bodies connected only by revolute joints, if all constraints are independent, the mobility (total degrees of freedom) is\n$$\nM=3N-2J,\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the number of revolute joints. If some constraints are redundant (dependent), the effective number of independent constraints is reduced accordingly.\n\n(a) System A is a four-rod loop (a rhombus). Here $N=4$ and the four vertices are hinges, so $J=4$. Therefore,\n$$\nN_{A}=M=3\\cdot 4-2\\cdot 4=12-8=4.\n$$\nThis equals three overall rigid-body degrees of freedom of the assembly plus one internal shape degree of freedom (the rhombus opening angle).\n\n(b) System B adds a fifth rod as a diagonal connecting two opposite vertices.

The assembly is kinematically a single rigid body and only the three overall rigid-body motions remain, consistent with $N_{B}=3$.\n\n(c) System C adds a sixth rod as the other diagonal with length $d_{2}=L$. From the analysis in part (b), the rhombus angle $\\theta$ is fixed. If $\\theta=2\\pi/3$, the other diagonal length is $2L\\cos(\\pi/3)=L$. If $\\theta=\\pi/3$, the other diagonal length is $2L\\sin(\\pi/6)=L$. So in either case, the added rod of length $L$ is geometrically compatible. Naively counting bodies and joints gives $N=6$, $J=8$, and\n$$\n3N-2J=3\\cdot 6-2\\cdot 8=18-16=2.\n$$\nHowever, in System B the assembly was already a single rigid body (no internal mobility), so attaching another rod by two hinges at two distinct points of the same rigid body imposes a redundant constraint. The mobility is not reduced further.
