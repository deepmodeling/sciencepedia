The mechanism consists of two links, `AB` and `BC`, of equal length $L$. These links are joined by a frictionless pin at pivot $B$. End $A$ of link `AB` is attached to a fixed frictionless pivot. End $C$ of link `BC` is a slider that is constrained to move along a straight horizontal line that passes directly through the fixed pivot $A$.\n\nA downward vertical input force $F_{\\text{in}}$ is applied at the central pivot $B$. In response, the slider at $C$ moves horizontally and comes into contact with a workpiece, exerting a horizontal clamping force $F_{\\text{clamp}}$ on it. The entire system is in a state of static equilibrium. The masses of the links are negligible, and all pivots are frictionless.\n\nIn the equilibrium configuration, both link `AB` and link `BC` make a small, non-zero angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal line of motion of the slider $C$.\n\nDetermine the mechanical advantage of the clamp, defined as the ratio of the clamping force to the input force, $F_{\\text{clamp}} / F_{\\text{in}}$.

This strip has a total mass $M$ and a total length $L$. In a test scenario, the strip is placed on a long, straight, horizontal guideway such that a portion of its length hangs vertically over the edge. When the braking system is at standby, the section of the strip resting on the horizontal guideway experiences a resistive magnetic drag force that, for the purpose of static analysis, acts identically to a standard friction force. This force opposes any impending sliding motion and has a maximum magnitude proportional to the normal force exerted by the guideway on the strip. The constant of proportionality is the effective coefficient of static friction, denoted by $\\mu_s$. The system is subject to a uniform gravitational acceleration $g$. Using the principle of virtual work, determine the maximum length of the strip that can hang over the edge of the guideway before the strip begins to slide.
