This first exercise guides you through the fundamental process of translating physical limitations into a set of mathematical equations, known as holonomic constraints. By analyzing a rigid triangular plate, you will practice identifying both internal constraints (what makes the object rigid) and external constraints (how it interacts with its environment) to systematically calculate the system's true mobility [@problem_id:2042116].", "problem": "A rigid, flat, non-degenerate triangular plate is analyzed in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The configuration of the plate is fully described by the coordinates of its three vertices, $\\vec{r}_1 = (x_1, y_1, z_1)$, $\\vec{r}_2 = (x_2, y_2, z_2)$, and $\\vec{r}_3 = (x_3, y_3, z_3)$. Initially, this system of nine coordinates is considered. The plate is then subjected to two sets of conditions: (1) the internal rigidity of the plate, meaning the distance between any two vertices is a fixed constant, and (2) an external constraint that forces the plate to lie and move exclusively within the horizontal $xy$-plane. Determine the total minimum number of independent holonomic equations required to mathematically represent both the internal rigidity and the external planar constraint.", "solution": "Let the generalized coordinates be the nine components of the three vertex position vectors,\n$$\nq=(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1},x_{2},y_{2},z_{2},x_{3},y_{3},z_{3}),\n$$\nso there are initially 9 degrees of freedom.\n\nInternal rigidity means the pairwise distances between vertices are fixed constants. For a non-degenerate triangle, there are exactly three edges, hence three holonomic constraints, which can be written as\n$$\nf_{12}=(\\vec{r}_{1}-\\vec{r}_{2})\\cdot(\\vec{r}_{1}-\\vec{r}_{2})-\\ell_{12}^{2}=0,\\quad\nf_{23}=(\\vec{r}_{2}-\\vec{r}_{3})\\cdot(\\vec{r}_{2}-\\vec{r}_{3})-\\ell_{23}^{2}=0,\\quad\nf_{31}=(\\vec{r}_{3}-\\vec{r}_{1})\\cdot(\\vec{r}_{3}-\\vec{r}_{1})-\\ell_{31}^{2}=0,\n$$\nwhere each $\\ell_{ij}$ is a fixed constant. These three constraints reduce the 9 coordinates to 6 degrees of freedom, as expected for a rigid body in three dimensions.\n\nThe external planar constraint that the plate lies and moves exclusively in the horizontal $xy$-plane is holonomic and is enforced by requiring each vertex to satisfy the plane equation $z=0$:\n$$\ng_{1}=z_{1}=0,\\quad g_{2}=z_{2}=0,\\quad g_{3}=z_{3}=0.\n$$\nThese are three independent constraints. They reduce the rigid body's 6 degrees of freedom to 3, corresponding to planar rigid-body motion (two in-plane translations and one in-plane rotation). Equivalently, they eliminate one translation (along the $z$-axis) and two rotations (tilts about the $x$- and $y$-axes).\n\nTherefore, the total minimum number of independent holonomic equations needed is the sum of the three internal rigidity constraints and the three planar constraints, giving\n$$\n3+3=6.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2042116"}, {"introduction": "While counting constraints from first principles is foundational, engineers and physicists often use powerful, standardized formulas for complex systems. This practice introduces the Kutzbach-Gruebler criterion, a classic tool for analyzing the mobility of mechanical linkages. By applying this formula to a common four-bar mechanism, you will see how the principles of links and joints can be used to efficiently determine the degrees of freedom in engineered systems [@problem_id:2042085].", "problem": "A simplified model for a mechanical agitator mechanism, used for mixing industrial fluids, consists of a planar assembly of four rigid bars. The first bar is a stationary base of length $d$, fixed to the ground. A second bar, the input crank of length $a$, is connected to one end of the base by a revolute joint (a simple pivot). A third bar, the coupler of length $b$, connects the free end of the input crank to one end of the fourth bar, the rocker arm of length $c$, also through a revolute joint. The other end of the rocker arm is connected to the free end of the stationary base by a fourth revolute joint. The entire system is constrained to move within a single two-dimensional plane. Determine the number of degrees of freedom of this agitator mechanism. A degree of freedom is an independent input required to fully specify the configuration of the system.", "solution": "We model the mechanism as a planar four-bar linkage with revolute joints. Let $N$ denote the total number of links including the ground, and let $J$ denote the total number of joints. For planar mechanisms, each unconstrained rigid body has $3$ degrees of freedom, and a revolute (lower) pair provides $f_{i}=1$ degree of relative motion while imposing $(3-f_{i})=2$ constraints.\n\nUsing the planar Kutzbach-Gruebler criterion,\n$$\nM = 3(N-1) - \\sum_{i=1}^{J} (3 - f_{i}).\n$$\nIn this mechanism:\n- The links are the ground (base), the input crank, the coupler, and the rocker arm, so $N=4$.\n- All joints are revolute, so for each joint $f_{i}=1$, hence $(3-f_{i})=2$.\n- There are four revolute joints, so $J=4$.\n\nSubstituting,\n$$\nM = 3(4-1) - \\sum_{i=1}^{4} 2 = 3 \\cdot 3 - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1.\n$$\nEquivalently, using the common form $M = 3(N-1) - 2J_{1} - J_{2}$ with $J_{1}=4$ lower pairs and $J_{2}=0$ higher pairs gives the same result:\n$$\nM = 3(4-1) - 2 \\cdot 4 - 0 = 9 - 8 = 1.\n$$\nThus the mechanism has one degree of freedom; a single independent input (e.g., the crank angle) fully specifies its configuration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2042085"}, {"introduction": "Not all physical restrictions can be expressed as simple equations of coordinates. This final exercise introduces a different and important class known as non-holonomic constraints, which restrict the system's possible velocities rather than its configuration. By examining the motion of a puck with a non-slipping blade, you will learn how to formulate these velocity-dependent constraints mathematically and appreciate the crucial distinction they represent in the study of dynamics [@problem_id:2042107].", "problem": "A small, self-steering robotic puck is designed to move on a large, flat horizontal surface, which we define as the $xy$-plane.

A sharp blade is fixed to the underside of the puck, aligned with its body. This blade imposes a physical constraint on the puck's motion: the puck cannot slip sideways.
