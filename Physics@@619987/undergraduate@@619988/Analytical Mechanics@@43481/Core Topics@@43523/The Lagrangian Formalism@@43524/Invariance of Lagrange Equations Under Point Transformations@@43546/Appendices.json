The new generalized coordinates are $(q_1, q_2)$, which correspond to the Cartesian coordinates $(x', y')$ of a frame rotated counter-clockwise by an angle $\\theta$ relative to the original $(x,y)$ frame.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the old coordinates $(x,y)$ and the new coordinates $(q_1, q_2)$. The standard equations for a counter-clockwise rotation of a coordinate system are:\n$$q_1 = x' = x \\cos\\theta + y \\sin\\theta$$\n$$q_2 = y' = -x \\sin\\theta + y \\cos\\theta$$\n\nTo express the potential $V(x,y)$ in terms of the new coordinates, we need to find the inverse transformation, which expresses $(x,y)$ in terms of $(q_1, q_2)$. We can solve the system of linear equations above for $x$ and $y$. A simpler way is to recognize that this is equivalent to rotating the new coordinates by an angle of $-\\theta$ to get back to the old ones.\nThe inverse transformation is:\n$$x = q_1 \\cos(-\\theta) + q_2 \\sin(-\\theta) = q_1 \\cos\\theta - q_2 \\sin\\theta$$\n$$y = -q_1 \\sin(-\\theta) + q_2 \\cos(-\\theta) = q_1 \\sin\\theta + q_2 \\cos\\theta$$\n\nNow we can substitute these expressions for $x$ and $y$ into the potential energy function $V(x,y)$.
