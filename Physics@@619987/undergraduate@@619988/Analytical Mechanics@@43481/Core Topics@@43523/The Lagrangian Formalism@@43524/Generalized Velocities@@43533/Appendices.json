The string runs from $m_1$ up to a small, massless, and frictionless pulley located at the top apex of the incline, and then hangs vertically down to the second mass, $m_2$. The entire system moves under the influence of a uniform gravitational field with acceleration $g$. We define a single generalized coordinate, $x$, as the distance of mass $m_1$ from the pulley, measured along the surface of the inclined plane.\n\nDetermine the total kinetic energy of the system as a function of the masses $m_1$, $m_2$, and the corresponding generalized velocity, $\\dot{x}$.", "solution": "The string is light and inextensible, and the pulley is massless and frictionless, so the only kinetic energies are those of the point masses.
