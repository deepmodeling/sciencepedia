This first practice challenges you to apply the fundamental definitions of scleronomic and rheonomic constraints by analyzing two scenarios involving a bead on a helical wire. By translating these physical situations into mathematical equations, you will learn to identify the explicit time dependence that distinguishes a rheonomic system from a scleronomic one. [@problem_id:2078851]", "problem": "In analytical mechanics, constraints on the motion of a system are classified based on their dependence on time. A constraint is called **scleronomic** if its equation of constraint, when written in terms of the system's coordinates, does not explicitly contain the time variable $t$. If the equation does explicitly contain time, the constraint is called **rheonomic**. A system with multiple constraints is classified as rheonomic if at least one of its constraints is rheonomic; otherwise, it is classified as scleronomic.\n\nConsider a small bead of mass $m$ that is constrained to slide without friction on a rigid wire. We analyze two different physical scenarios for the motion of this bead.\n\n**Scenario 1:** The wire is bent into the shape of a simple helix of constant radius $R$ and constant pitch $p = 2\\pi c$. The helix is aligned with the z-axis, and its shape and position are fixed in space.\n\n**Scenario 2:** In a different experiment, the helical wire is part of a machine. The wire still has a constant radius $R$, but now it rotates about its central z-axis with a constant angular velocity $\\omega$. Simultaneously, the pitch of the helix is no longer constant but increases with time according to the rule $p(t) = 2\\pi c_0 \\exp(\\alpha t)$, where $c_0$ and $\\alpha$ are positive constants.\n\nBased on the definitions provided, how would you classify the system of constraints in each scenario?\n\nA) Scenario 1 is scleronomic, Scenario 2 is scleronomic.\n\nB) Scenario 1 is scleronomic, Scenario 2 is rheonomic.\n\nC) Scenario 1 is rheonomic, Scenario 2 is scleronomic.\n\nD) Scenario 1 is rheonomic, Scenario 2 is rheonomic.\n\nE) The constraints in both scenarios are non-holonomic, so this classification does not apply.", "solution": "Let the bead’s position in the inertial (laboratory) frame be described by Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. A helical wire of radius $R$ and pitch $p=2\\pi c$ aligned with the $z$-axis can be parameterized by an intrinsic parameter $\\phi$ along the wire. In terms of $\\phi$, for a fixed helix one can write the holonomic constraints as\n$$\nf_{1}(x,y,\\phi)=x-R\\cos\\phi=0,\\quad f_{2}(x,y,\\phi)=y-R\\sin\\phi=0,\\quad f_{3}(z,\\phi)=z-c\\,\\phi=0.\n$$\nThese three equations define a one-dimensional submanifold (the curve) in three-dimensional space, with $\\phi$ serving as the single generalized coordinate.\n\nScenario 1 (fixed helix): The radius $R$ and pitch parameter $c$ are constant, and the wire does not move in space. The constraints can be written as\n$$\nx-R\\cos\\phi=0,\\quad y-R\\sin\\phi=0,\\quad z-c\\,\\phi=0,\n$$\nwhich contain no explicit appearance of the time variable $t$. By the given definition, constraints with no explicit $t$-dependence are scleronomic. Therefore, Scenario 1 is scleronomic.\n\nScenario 2 (rotating helix with time-varying pitch): The wire rotates rigidly about the $z$-axis with constant angular velocity $\\omega$, and its pitch varies with time according to $p(t)=2\\pi c(t)$ with $c(t)=c_{0}\\exp(\\alpha t)$. A convenient way to express the constraints in the laboratory frame is to write the body-fixed helix $(x_{b},y_{b},z_{b})=(R\\cos\\phi,\\,R\\sin\\phi,\\,c(t)\\,\\phi)$ and then rotate it about the $z$-axis by angle $\\omega t$, yielding\n$$\nx=R\\cos\\!\\bigl(\\phi+\\omega t\\bigr),\\quad y=R\\sin\\!\\bigl(\\phi+\\omega t\\bigr),\\quad z=c(t)\\,\\phi.\n$$\nEquivalently, the constraints are\n$$\nf_{1}(x,y,\\phi,t)=x-R\\cos\\!\\bigl(\\phi+\\omega t\\bigr)=0,\\quad f_{2}(x,y,\\phi,t)=y-R\\sin\\!\\bigl(\\phi+\\omega t\\bigr)=0,\\quad f_{3}(z,\\phi,t)=z-c(t)\\,\\phi=0,\n$$\nwith $c(t)=c_{0}\\exp(\\alpha t)$. Each of these constraints contains explicit dependence on $t$ (through $\\omega t$ and $c(t)$). By the given definition, the presence of explicit $t$ in any constraint makes the system rheonomic. Therefore, Scenario 2 is rheonomic.\n\nCombining both classifications: Scenario 1 is scleronomic, Scenario 2 is rheonomic.

While ideal scleronomic constraints do no work, rheonomic constraints can.
