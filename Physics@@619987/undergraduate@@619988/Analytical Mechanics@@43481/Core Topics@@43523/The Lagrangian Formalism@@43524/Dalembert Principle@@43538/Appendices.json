By shifting our perspective to the non-inertial frame of the accelerating wedge, we can treat a dynamics problem as a much simpler statics problem. The key is to introduce a fictitious inertial force, allowing us to find the precise acceleration needed for equilibrium [@problem_id:2043856].", "problem": "An engineering team is developing a calibration device for a new type of accelerometer. The core of the device consists of a small test mass of mass $m$, which is placed upon the perfectly smooth (frictionless) inclined surface of a wedge. The wedge has a mass $M$, and its inclined face makes an angle $\\theta$ with the horizontal plane. The entire wedge assembly is mounted on a horizontal track that allows it to accelerate without any rotation.\n\nFor a specific calibration routine, it is required that the test mass $m$ remains completely stationary with respect to the surface of the accelerating wedge. Determine the magnitude of the horizontal acceleration, $A$, that must be applied to the wedge to achieve this condition. The acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nProvide your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $g$ and $\\theta$.", "solution": "Let the wedge be given a horizontal acceleration of magnitude $A$ directed to the left, so that in the non-inertial frame of the wedge the fictitious (inertial) force on the mass $m$ is $mA$ to the right. For the mass to remain stationary relative to the wedge, its acceleration in this frame is zero, so the vector sum of real forces (gravity and normal) and the fictitious force must be zero.

In this problem, we analyze the forces on a pod in a banked curve by moving into its rotating reference frame [@problem_id:2043853].
