By analyzing a simple system of a disk sliding inside a moving elevator, we can directly visualize and calculate the \"volume\" of all possible states. This exercise [@problem_id:2039838] helps ground the concept in familiar geometry and provides a solid foundation for understanding how constraints define the boundaries of a system's possibilities.", "problem": "An elevator car is designed for transporting sensitive equipment. The interior of the car features a perfectly horizontal rectangular floor with a length $L$ and a width $W$. The car moves strictly in the vertical direction, capable of traveling from the ground floor, which we define as height zero, up to a maximum height $H$.\n\nOn the floor of this elevator, there is a thin, uniform, circular disk of radius $R$. This disk can slide without friction on the floor. However, physical constraints require that the disk must always remain entirely on the floor's surface, meaning no part of the disk can extend beyond the edges of the rectangular floor. We assume that $L > 2R$ and $W > 2R$.\n\nThe state of this entire mechanical system can be fully described by a set of generalized coordinates: one for the vertical position of the elevator car's floor and two for the position of the disk's center relative to the center of the floor. The collection of all possible allowed states for these coordinates constitutes a region in a 3-dimensional space, often called the configuration space.\n\nDetermine the total volume of this configuration space. Express your answer as a single, closed-form analytic expression in terms of the given parameters $L, W, H,$ and $R$.", "solution": "Let the elevator’s vertical coordinate be $z$, measured from the ground, with the allowed range $0 \\leq z \\leq H$. This coordinate is independent of the disk’s position on the floor, so it contributes a factor of length $H$ to the configuration space volume.\n\nPlace the origin at the center of the rectangular floor. The floor occupies $\\left[-\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2}\\right] \\times \\left[-\\frac{W}{2}, \\frac{W}{2}\\right]$ in the horizontal plane. For the circular disk of radius $R$ to remain entirely on the floor, the center $(x,y)$ must be at least a distance $R$ from each edge. Therefore, the admissible set for the center is\n$$\n|x| \\leq \\frac{L}{2} - R, \\quad |y| \\leq \\frac{W}{2} - R,\n$$\nwhich is a rectangle of side lengths $L - 2R$ and $W - 2R$. The area of admissible $(x,y)$ positions is thus $(L - 2R)(W - 2R)$.\n\nSince the $z$ coordinate is independent, the configuration space is the Cartesian product of the interval $[0,H]$ and the admissible $(x,y)$ rectangle. The total configuration space volume $V$ is the triple integral of $1$ over this region:\n$$\nV \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{H} \\int_{-\\left(\\frac{W}{2} - R\\right)}^{\\frac{W}{2} - R} \\int_{-\\left(\\frac{L}{2} - R\\right)}^{\\frac{L}{2} - R} 1 \\, dx \\, dy \\, dz \n\\;=\\; H \\,(L - 2R)\\,(W - 2R).\n$$\nThis uses the assumptions $L > 2R$ and $W > 2R$ to ensure a nonempty admissible region for the disk’s center.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{H\\,(L-2R)\\,(W-2R)}$$", "id": "2039838"}, {"introduction": "Moving from purely translational motion, we now consider systems with rotational freedom, which are fundamental in fields like robotics.

Therefore, each $q_{i}$ takes values on a circle, topologically $S^{1}$.\n\nBecause the joints are frictionless and rotate freely and the base pivot $O$ is fixed, the configuration of the three-link planar chain is completely specified by the ordered triple $(q_{1},q_{2},q_{3})$, with no translational degrees of freedom. The configuration space is thus the Cartesian product of three circles:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = S^{1} \\times S^{1} \\times S^{1}.\n$$\nThis product space is topologically a 3-torus, denoted $\\mathbb{T}^{3}$. The link length $L$ does not affect the topology of the configuration space under the given assumptions (no collision constraints or obstacles are specified).\n\nTo exclude the other options: $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is inappropriate because angles are periodic and do not form Euclidean coordinates; $S^{3}$ is not homeomorphic to $S^{1} \\times S^{1} \\times S^{1}$; $S^{1} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ would correspond to one circular and one nonperiodic degree of freedom, which is not the case; and $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$ would correspond to only two independent angular degrees of freedom, whereas there are three.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2039848"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice introduces a subtle but profound concept: the effect of particle indistinguishability on the configuration space.
