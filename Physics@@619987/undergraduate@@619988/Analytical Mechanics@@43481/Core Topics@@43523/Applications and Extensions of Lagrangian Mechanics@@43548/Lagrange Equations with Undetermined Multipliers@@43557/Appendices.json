We can solve this using the method of Lagrange multipliers in a Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y,z)$.\n\nFirst, we define the Lagrangian $L = T - U$ for the particle. The kinetic energy is $T = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2)$, and the potential energy due to gravity is $U = mgz$.\nSo, the Lagrangian is:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{2}m(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\dot{z}^2) - mgz$$\n\nNext, we write the two holonomic constraint equations in the form $f_j(x,y,z) = 0$:\n1.  Cylinder constraint: $f_1(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 - R^2 = 0$.\n2.  Sphere constraint: $f_2(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 4R^2 = 0$.\n\nThe Lagrange equations of motion with undetermined multipliers $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are given by:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q_i}} - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial q_i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{2} \\lambda_j \\frac{\\partial f_j}{\\partial q_i} $$\nwhere $q_i$ are the coordinates $x, y, z$.\n\nFor $q_1 = x$:\n$$ m\\ddot{x} - 0 = \\lambda_1 (2x) + \\lambda_2 (2x) \\implies m\\ddot{x} = 2x(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2) $$\nFor $q_2 = y$:\n$$ m\\ddot{y} - 0 = \\lambda_1 (2y) + \\lambda_2 (2y) \\implies m\\ddot{y} = 2y(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2) $$\nFor $q_3 = z$:\n$$ m\\ddot{z} - (-mg) = \\lambda_1 (0) + \\lambda_2 (2z) \\implies m\\ddot{z} + mg = 2z\\lambda_2 $$\n\nTo solve for the multipliers, we need to understand the particle's kinematics. The particle's path is the intersection of the two surfaces. By substituting the cylinder equation ($x^2+y^2=R^2$) into the sphere equation, we find the z-coordinates of the path:\n$$ R^2 + z^2 = (2R)^2 = 4R^2 \\implies z^2 = 3R^2 \\implies z = \\pm\\sqrt{3}R $$\nThis means the particle is confined to move on one of two horizontal circles of radius $R$, located at constant heights $z = \\sqrt{3}R$ and $z = -\\sqrt{3}R$.\nSince the particle is moving on a path with constant $z$, its velocity in the z-direction is zero ($\\dot{z}=0$), and its acceleration is also zero ($\\ddot{z}=0$). The problem states the particle moves at a constant speed $v$. For circular motion with radius $R$ at a constant speed $v$, the acceleration is purely centripetal, directed towards the center of the circle (the z-axis).\nThe acceleration vector is $\\mathbf{a} = -\\frac{v^2}{R^2}(x, y, 0)$.\nTherefore, the components of acceleration are $\\ddot{x} = -\\frac{v^2}{R^2}x$ and $\\ddot{y} = -\\frac{v^2}{R^2}y$.\n\nNow we substitute these back into the equations of motion to find the multipliers. Let's consider the upper circle, $z = \\sqrt{3}R$:\nFrom the x-equation: $m(-\\frac{v^2}{R^2}x) = 2x(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2)$. Assuming the particle is moving ($x$ is not always zero), we can divide by $2x$:\n$$ \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = -\\frac{mv^2}{2R^2} $$\nFrom the z-equation, with $\\ddot{z}=0$ and $z=\\sqrt{3}R$:\n$$ m(0) + mg = 2(\\sqrt{3}R)\\lambda_2 \\implies \\lambda_2 = \\frac{mg}{2\\sqrt{3}R} $$\n(Note: For the lower circle, $z=-\\sqrt{3}R$, one would find $\\lambda_2 = -\\frac{mg}{2\\sqrt{3}R}$, but the final magnitude will be the same).\n\nThe total force of constraint $\\mathbf{F}_c$ is given by the sum of the multiplier terms:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}_c = \\sum_{j=1}^{2} \\lambda_j \\nabla f_j = \\lambda_1 \\nabla f_1 + \\lambda_2 \\nabla f_2 $$\nThe gradients of the constraint functions are:\n$$ \\nabla f_1 = (2x, 2y, 0) $$\n$$ \\nabla f_2 = (2x, 2y, 2z) $$\nSo, the constraint force is:\n$$ \\mathbf{F}_c = \\lambda_1 (2x, 2y, 0) + \\lambda_2 (2x, 2y, 2z) = (2x(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2), 2y(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2), 2z\\lambda_2) $$\nWe can now substitute our determined values for the combinations of multipliers:\nThe x-component of the force is $F_{c,x} = 2x(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2) = 2x(-\\frac{mv^2}{2R^2}) = -x\\frac{mv^2}{R^2}$.\nThe y-component of the force is $F_{c,y} = 2y(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2) = 2y(-\\frac{mv^2}{2R^2}) = -y\\frac{mv^2}{R^2}$.\nThe z-component of the force is $F_{c,z} = 2z\\lambda_2 = 2(\\sqrt{3}R)\\left(\\frac{mg}{2\\sqrt{3}R}\\right) = mg$.\n\nThe total constraint force vector is $\\mathbf{F}_c = (-x\\frac{mv^2}{R^2}, -y\\frac{mv^2}{R^2}, mg)$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the magnitude of this force:\n$$ |\\mathbf{F}_c| = \\sqrt{ F_{c,x}^2 + F_{c,y}^2 + F_{c,z}^2 } = \\sqrt{ \\left(-x\\frac{mv^2}{R^2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-y\\frac{mv^2}{R^2}\\right)^2 + (mg)^2 } $$\n$$ |\\mathbf{F}_c| = \\sqrt{ \\frac{m^2v^4}{R^4}(x^2+y^2) + m^2g^2 } $$\nUsing the constraint $x^2+y^2=R^2$, we get:\n$$ |\\mathbf{F}_c| = \\sqrt{ \\frac{m^2v^4}{R^4}(R^2) + m^2g^2 } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{m^2v^4}{R^2} + m^2g^2 } $$\nFactoring out $m$ gives the final expression:\n$$ |\\mathbf{F}_c| = m\\sqrt{\\frac{v^4}{R^2} + g^2} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{m\\sqrt{g^{2} + \\frac{v^{4}}{R^{2}}}}$$", "id": "2062993"}, {"introduction": "Now, we will elevate the complexity by moving into a non-inertial, rotating frame of reference.
