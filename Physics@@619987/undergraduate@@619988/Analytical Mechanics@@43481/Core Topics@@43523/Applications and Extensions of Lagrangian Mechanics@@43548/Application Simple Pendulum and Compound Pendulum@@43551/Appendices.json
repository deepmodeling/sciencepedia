The pendulum consists of a small bob of mass $m$ attached to a massless, inextensible string of length $L$. The string is suspended from a fixed pivot point $O$. To alter the timing characteristics, a small, horizontal, frictionless pin is rigidly fixed at a point $P$ located a vertical distance of $d = L/2$ directly below the pivot $O$. The pendulum is released from rest at a small initial angle with respect to the vertical. As the bob swings past the vertical, the string makes contact with the pin, causing the effective pivot to change for the second half of its swing.
