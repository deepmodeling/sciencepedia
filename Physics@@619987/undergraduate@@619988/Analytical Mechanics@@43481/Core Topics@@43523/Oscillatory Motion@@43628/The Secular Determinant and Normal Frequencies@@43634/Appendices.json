Each mass is suspended by a massless, inextensible string of length $L$, forming two simple pendulums. The pivot points are fixed and separated horizontally. When the masses hang at rest, the strings are vertical and parallel. The two masses are then connected by a light horizontal spring of spring constant $k$. The spring is unstretched when both masses are at their respective equilibrium positions.
