The hoop is fixed in place within a region of space containing both a uniform gravitational field of magnitude $g$ pointing vertically downwards, and a uniform electric field of magnitude $E_0$ pointing horizontally to the right. The parameters are chosen such that the magnitude of the total electric force on the bead, $qE_0$, is exactly equal to the magnitude of the total gravitational force on it, $mg$.\n\nThe bead is initially held at rest at the highest point of the hoop and is then released.\n\nDetermine an expression for the magnitude of the bead's angular velocity the first time it reaches the lowest point of the hoop. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters $g$ and $R$.", "solution": "The problem can be solved using the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. Since the gravitational force and the static electric field are both conservative forces, and the normal force from the frictionless hoop does no work, the total mechanical energy of the bead is conserved.\n\nFirst, let's establish a coordinate system and define the potential energy. Let the origin $(0,0)$ be at the center of the circular hoop. Let the $\\hat{i}$ direction be horizontal and to the right, and the $\\hat{j}$ direction be vertical and upwards. The angular position of the bead on the hoop can be described by an angle $\\theta$, measured clockwise from the upward vertical axis. In this system:\n- The highest point of the hoop corresponds to $\\theta = 0$.\n- The lowest point of the hoop corresponds to $\\theta = \\pi$.\n- The position vector of the bead is $\\vec{r}(\\theta) = R\\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{i} + R\\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{j}$.\n\nThe gravitational potential energy $U_g$ is given by $U_g = mgy$, where $y = R\\cos\\theta$.

The final potential energy is:\n$$U_f = U(\\pi) = mgR(\\cos(\\pi) - \\sin(\\pi)) = mgR(-1 - 0) = -mgR$$\nThe total final energy is $E_{\\text{final}} = T_f + U_f = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2 - mgR$.\n\nBy the conservation of energy:\n$$E_{\\text{initial}} = E_{\\text{final}}$$\n$$mgR = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2 - mgR$$\n\nNow, we solve for $\\dot{\\theta}_f^2$:\n$$2mgR = \\frac{1}{2}mR^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2$$\n$$4mgR = mR^2\\dot{\\theta}_f^2$$\n$$\\dot{\\theta}_f^2 = \\frac{4mgR}{mR^2} = \\frac{4g}{R}$$\n\nThe angular velocity is $\\dot{\\theta}_f = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{4g}{R}} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{R}}$.\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the angular velocity, which is:\n$$|\\dot{\\theta}_f| = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{R}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{R}}}$$", "id": "2070783"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most illuminating features within a phase portrait are the equilibrium points and the special trajectories, known as separatrices, that divide different regimes of motion.
