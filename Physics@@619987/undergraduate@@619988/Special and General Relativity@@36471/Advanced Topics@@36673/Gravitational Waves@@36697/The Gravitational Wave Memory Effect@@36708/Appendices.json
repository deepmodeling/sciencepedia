It requires the numerical calculation of the nonlinear gravitational-wave memory effect for a simplified burst signal. We will first establish the theoretical basis and the specific formula to be implemented, then proceed with the numerical solution as specified.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the relationship between the measured gravitational wave energy flux and the permanent change in strain, $\\Delta h_+$, known as the Christodoulou memory. This effect arises from the fact that gravitational waves carry energy and momentum, and thus gravitate themselves. The stress-energy of the wave, as described by the Isaacson tensor, acts as a source in the Einstein field equations, generating a second-order, non-oscillatory component of the metric perturbation which persists after the wave has passed.\n\nThe Isaacson energy flux is given by:\n$$\nF(t) = \\frac{c^3}{16\\pi G}\\left(\\dot{h}_+^2(t)+\\dot{h}_\\times^2(t)\\right)\n$$\nThis represents the total energy per unit area per unit time carried by the wave. The memory effect, however, is sensitive to the anisotropy of the radiation. For an observer along the line of propagation, the permanent change in the plus-polarized strain, $\\Delta h_+$, is sourced by the anisotropic part of the wave's stress.\n\nA rigorous derivation involves solving the second-order Einstein equations with the Isaacson tensor as a source. This procedure is complex. However, the problem requests the \"simplest line-of-sight, plane-wave relation\". A well-established result from such analyses, which can be justified heuristically, connects the memory to the time integral of the difference between the \"power\" in the two polarizations. This formulation correctly captures the physical expectation that a purely circularly polarized wave (which is axisymmetric about the propagation direction) should not produce this type of memory along its axis.\n\nThe appropriate relationship, expressed in terms of the strain components measured at a distance $R$ from the source, is:\n$$\n\\Delta h_+ = \\frac{R}{2c} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left( \\dot{h}_+^2(t) - \\dot{h}_\\times^2(t) \\right) dt\n$$\nThis formula is dimensionally correct. The strain $h$ is dimensionless, so $\\dot{h}$ has units of $s^{-1}$. The integral has units of $s^{-1}$. The prefactor $R/c$ has units of $s$, rendering $\\Delta h_+$ dimensionless. The physical scaling is also correct: for a source at distance $R$, the strain amplitude $h \\propto 1/R$, so $\\dot{h}^2 \\propto 1/R^2$. The integral term thus scales as $1/R^2$, and the overall $\\Delta h_+ \\propto (R) \\cdot (1/R^2) = 1/R$, as expected for a metric perturbation from a distant source.\n\nHaving established the key formula, we proceed to the numerical implementation.\nThe signal components are:\n$$\nh_+(t) = A\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\omega_0 t\\right)\n$$\n$$\nh_\\times(t) = \\epsilon\\,A\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\omega_0 t\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi f_0$. Let the envelope be $E(t) = A\\,\\exp(-t^2/(2\\sigma^2))$.\nTheir time derivatives are calculated analytically using the product rule:\n$$\n\\dot{h}_+(t) = \\dot{E}(t)\\cos(\\omega_0 t) - \\omega_0 E(t)\\sin(\\omega_0 t)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{h}_\\times(t) = \\epsilon \\left( \\dot{E}(t)\\sin(\\omega_0 t) + \\omega_0 E(t)\\cos(\\omega_0 t) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{E}(t) = - \\frac{t}{\\sigma^2} E(t)$.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Define the physical constants $G$, $c$, and the conversion factor for parsecs to meters.\n2.  Set up the time grid $t$ from $-0.5\\,s$ to $0.5\\,s$ with step $\\Delta t = 10^{-4}\\,s$.\n3.  For each test case with parameters $(A, f_0, \\sigma, \\epsilon, R, L)$:\n    a. Convert the distance $R$ from megaparsecs to meters.\n    b. Define the envelope function $E(t)$ and its derivative $\\dot{E}(t)$ on the time grid.\n    c. Calculate the arrays for $\\dot{h}_+(t)$ and $\\dot{h}_\\times(t)$ using the analytical formulae above.\n    d. Compute the integrand $I(t) = \\dot{h}_+^2(t) - \\dot{h}_\\times^2(t)$.\n    e. Numerically integrate $I(t)$ over the time grid using the trapezoidal rule to find $\\int I(t) dt$.\n    f. Calculate the permanent strain change $\\Delta h_+ = \\frac{R}{2c} \\int I(t) dt$.\n    g. Finally, compute the permanent displacement of the detector arm: $\\Delta L = \\frac{1}{2} L \\Delta h_+$.\n4.  Collect the results for all test cases and present them in the specified format.\n\nFor Case A (circular polarization, $\\epsilon=1$), the integrand $\\dot{h}_+^2 - \\dot{h}_\\times^2$ becomes a sum of terms modulated by $\\cos(2\\omega_0 t)$ and $\\sin(2\\omega_0 t)$. As the carrier frequency $f_0=150\\,Hz$ is much higher than the envelope's characteristic frequency ($1/\\sigma = 20\\,Hz$), the integral over these rapidly oscillating terms is expected to be very close to zero. The same applies to Case D. For Case B, the amplitude $A=0$, so the result is trivially zero. For Case C (linear polarization, $\\epsilon=0$), $\\dot{h}_\\times=0$, and the integrand is simply $\\dot{h}_+^2$, which is strictly non-negative. Its integral will be non-zero, yielding a measurable memory effect.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the gravitational-wave memory effect for several test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Physical Constants in SI units\n    G = 6.67430e-11  # m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\n    c = 2.99792458e8   # m s^-1\n    PC_TO_M = 3.085677581491367e16  # meters per parsec\n\n    # Shared parameters for all test cases\n    L_arm = 4000.0  # meters\n    R_dist_mpc = 100.0  # megaparsecs\n    R_dist_m = R_dist_mpc * 1e6 * PC_TO_M\n\n    # Numerical grid specifications\n    t_start = -0.5  # seconds\n    t_end = 0.5    # seconds\n    dt = 1e-4      # seconds\n    t = np.arange(t_start, t_end + dt, dt)\n\n    # Test suite: (A, f0, sigma, epsilon)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A: Circularly polarized burst\n        (1.0e-21, 150.0, 0.05, 1.0),\n        # Case B: No signal\n        (0.0, 150.0, 0.05, 1.0),\n        # Case C: Plus-only burst\n        (1.0e-21, 150.0, 0.05, 0.0),\n        # Case D: Stronger circular burst\n        (2.0e-21, 150.0, 0.05, 1.0),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for A, f0, sigma, epsilon in test_cases:\n        # If amplitude is zero, result is trivially zero\n        if A == 0.0:\n            results.append(0.0)\n            continue\n            \n        omega0 = 2.0 * np.pi * f0\n\n        # Define Gaussian envelope and its derivative\n        # E(t) = A * exp(-t^2 / (2*sigma^2))\n        envelope_t = A * np.exp(-t**2 / (2.0 * sigma**2))\n        \n        # dE/dt = - (t/sigma^2) * E(t)\n        envelope_dot_t = -(t / sigma**2) * envelope_t\n\n        # Calculate time derivatives of h_plus and h_cross\n        # h_plus(t) = envelope(t) * cos(omega0 * t)\n        # h_cross(t) = epsilon * envelope(t) * sin(omega0 * t)\n        \n        cos_t = np.cos(omega0 * t)\n        sin_t = np.sin(omega0 * t)\n        \n        # dh_plus/dt = dE/dt * cos(omega0*t) - omega0 * E(t) * sin(omega0*t)\n        h_plus_dot_t = envelope_dot_t * cos_t - omega0 * envelope_t * sin_t\n        \n        # dh_cross/dt = epsilon * (dE/dt * sin(omega0*t) + omega0 * E(t) * cos(omega0*t))\n        h_cross_dot_t = epsilon * (envelope_dot_t * sin_t + omega0 * envelope_t * cos_t)\n\n        # Integrand for memory calculation\n        # I(t) = (dh_plus/dt)^2 - (dh_cross/dt)^2\n        integrand = h_plus_dot_t**2 - h_cross_dot_t**2\n\n        # Numerically integrate using the trapezoidal rule\n        integral_val = np.trapz(integrand, t, dx=dt)\n        \n        # Calculate the permanent strain change (memory)\n        # Delta_h_plus = (R / (2*c)) * integral_val\n        delta_h_plus = (R_dist_m / (2.0 * c)) * integral_val\n\n        # Calculate the permanent arm displacement\n        # Delta_L = (1/2) * L * Delta_h_plus\n        delta_L = 0.5 * L_arm * delta_h_plus\n        \n        results.append(delta_L)\n\n    # Format the final output as a comma-separated list in brackets\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "2399205"}]}
