Such paths can be followed by massive particles. In this particular theoretical spacetime, it is possible for a path that is a simple circle (i.e., a path of constant coordinate time $t$, constant radius $r$, and constant vertical position $z$) to become a Closed Timelike Curve (CTC), a configuration that would allow for signals to travel into their own past.\n\nYour task is to find the symbolic expression for the minimum radius, $r_{min}$, beyond which these causality-violating circular paths can exist.", "solution": "We are given a spacetime with line element\n$$ds^{2} = -c^{2} dt^{2} + dr^{2} + dz^{2} + \\left(A r^{2} - B r^{4}\\right) d\\phi^{2},$$\nwhere $A>0$ is dimensionless and $B>0$ has units of inverse length squared.\n\nA circular path at fixed $t$, fixed $r$, and fixed $z$ is closed because $\\phi$ is periodic.

By applying the Novikov self-consistency principle, you will reason through the possible outcomes to find the only one that avoids a logical contradiction, revealing how physics can enforce a globally consistent history.", "problem": "A researcher in theoretical physics is exploring the consequences of a traversable wormhole in a flat spacetime. The wormhole has two mouths, Mouth A and Mouth B, which are stationary in the laboratory reference frame. Mouth A is located at position $x_A = 0$ and Mouth B is at $x_B = L$. The wormhole is constructed such that any object entering Mouth B at a laboratory time $t_{enter}$ instantaneously emerges from Mouth A at an earlier laboratory time $t_{emerge} = t_{enter} - \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is a fixed positive time interval. This setup effectively creates a closed timelike curve.\n\nThe researcher devises a thought experiment involving a single billiard ball, treated as a point particle. Initially, at time $t < 0$, the ball is at rest at a position $x_{ball}$ where $0 < x_{ball} < L$. The plan is to strike the ball at time $t=0$, imparting a velocity $v$ such that it travels towards Mouth B. The velocity $v$ and initial position $x_{ball}$ are precisely chosen so that, if its motion were undisturbed, the ball would enter Mouth B and emerge from Mouth A at a time $t_{emerge} < 0$, on a collision course with its past, stationary self. Specifically, the emerging ball is aimed to strike the stationary ball at its initial position $x_{ball}$ at a time $t_{collide} < 0$, which would knock it off its initial position, thereby preventing it from being in the right place for the experimenter to strike it at $t=0$. This creates an apparent causality paradox.\n\nAssuming that the laws of physics are perfectly self-consistent and do not permit logical contradictions, which one of the following scenarios describes a valid, non-paradoxical outcome of this experiment?\n\nA. The experiment proceeds as planned, but as the ball emerges from Mouth A, it and its past self pass through each other without interaction, as if they were ghosts.\n\nB. The experiment unfolds as planned. The ball travels back in time and collides with its past self, knocking it away. The resulting state is a logical paradox, proving that such wormholes cannot exist.\n\nC. The impending paradoxical loop causes a massive energy fluctuation that destroys the wormhole just before the ball can enter Mouth B.\n\nD. The only self-consistent history is one where the ball is never truly at rest before $t=0$. Instead, the ball, in its past, is struck by its future self emerging from Mouth A. This \"glancing blow\" alters its trajectory just enough so that it proceeds to travel towards Mouth B, enters the wormhole, and emerges from Mouth A on the precise path required to deliver that exact same glancing blow to its younger self.\n\nE. The ball enters Mouth B, but emerges from Mouth A with a slightly different velocity vector than expected due to unpredictable quantum effects, causing it to narrowly miss its past self. This allows the original history to occur without a collision.", "solution": "We formalize the wormhole identification and the kinematics, then apply the Novikov self-consistency principle to determine a non-paradoxical outcome.\n\nBy construction, the wormhole maps any object entering at $(x_{B}=L, t_{enter})$ to an exit at $(x_{A}=0, t_{emerge})$ with\n$$\nt_{emerge}=t_{enter}-\\Delta t,\\quad \\Delta t>0.\n$$\nThe ball is initially at $x_{ball}$ with $0<x_{ball}<L$. If struck at $t=0$, it is launched toward $x=L$ with speed $|\\vec{v}|=v$ along $+\\hat{x}$, so the entry time (if undisturbed) is\n$$\nt_{enter}=\\frac{L-x_{ball}}{|\\vec{v}|},\n$$\nand the emergence time would be\n$$\nt_{emerge}=t_{enter}-\\Delta t=\\frac{L-x_{ball}}{|\\vec{v}|}-\\Delta t<0.\n$$\nTo realize a collision with the past ball at $x=x_{ball}$ at a time $t_{collide}<0$, the emergent ball must leave Mouth A at $t_{emerge}$ with some velocity $\\vec{u}$ such that the travel time from $x=0$ to $x=x_{ball}$ equals $t_{collide}-t_{emerge}$:\n$$\nt_{collide}-t_{emerge}=\\frac{x_{ball}}{|\\vec{u}|}.\n$$\nFor the younger copy to reach Mouth B after the collision and enter at $t_{enter}$, its post-collision speed must be $|\\vec{v}|$ along the appropriate direction, giving the time from collision to entry as\n$$\nt_{enter}-t_{collide}=\\frac{L-x_{ball}}{|\\vec{v}|}.\n$$\nAdding the two relations eliminates $t_{collide}$ and $t_{enter}$, producing the consistency condition\n$$\n\\Delta t=\\frac{x_{ball}}{|\\vec{u}|}+\\frac{L-x_{ball}}{|\\vec{v}|}.\n$$\nFor any given $L$, $x_{ball}$, and $\\Delta t$, this equation can be satisfied by suitable choices of $|\\vec{u}|$ and $|\\vec{v}|$ and corresponding directions, so timing by itself poses no logical obstruction.\n\nNow impose local dynamics at the encounter. Treat the ball as a classical point particle with elastic, short-range interaction. At the collision (between the emerging “older” copy and the “younger” copy that had been at rest), conservation of linear momentum and kinetic energy for equal masses $m$ gives\n$$\nm\\vec{u}+m\\vec{0}=m\\vec{w}+m\\vec{v},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{m}{2}|\\vec{u}|^{2}=\\frac{m}{2}|\\vec{w}|^{2}+\\frac{m}{2}|\\vec{v}|^{2},\n$$\nwhich imply\n$$\n\\vec{u}=\\vec{w}+\\vec{v},\\quad |\\vec{u}|^{2}=|\\vec{w}|^{2}+|\\vec{v}|^{2}\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\vec{w}\\cdot\\vec{v}=0.\n$$\nThus, for equal masses with one initially at rest, the post-collision velocities are orthogonal and share the initial kinetic energy. Choose the collision geometry so that the younger copy’s post-collision velocity is precisely $\\vec{v}$ toward Mouth B; then it reaches $x=L$ at $t_{enter}$, enters the wormhole, and emerges at $t_{emerge}=t_{enter}-\\Delta t$ with velocity $\\vec{u}$ set by the elastic scattering geometry. That emergent trajectory returns to $x_{ball}$ at $t_{collide}$ to deliver exactly the same off-center (glancing) impact just analyzed. The older copy’s post-collision velocity $\\vec{w}$, being orthogonal to $\\vec{v}$, simply carries it away without creating further inconsistencies.\n\nThis constructs a single, globally consistent worldline containing one wormhole traversal and a self-interaction segment between $t_{emerge}$ and $t_{enter}$. No logical contradiction occurs; the past is not freely mutable because only histories satisfying the above constraints are realized. This is precisely the Novikov self-consistency principle applied to the Polchinski billiard-ball setup.\n\nAssessing the options:\n\n- A contradicts ordinary local interactions of matter (no physical basis for noninteracting “ghosts” is provided).\n- B violates the stated assumption that physics forbids logical contradictions.\n- C introduces an ad hoc destruction mechanism not required by self-consistency; moreover, a consistent solution explicitly exists as shown.\n- D exactly matches the self-consistent elastic “glancing blow” solution derived above.\n- E appeals to uncontrolled quantum randomness to avoid collision, but the setup is classical and deterministic; moreover, generic random deviations would not, without fine-tuning, satisfy the loop-closure constraints.
