{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The statement \"a black hole has no hair\" is one of the most evocative phrases in theoretical physics. It encapsulates the core idea of the no-hair theorem: that the final, stable state of a black hole is incredibly simple, defined only by its mass, angular momentum, and electric charge. This thought experiment [@problem_id:1869324] challenges you to apply this principle by comparing two black holes formed from fundamentally different materials, forcing a confrontation with the idea that all the complex information about the progenitor star is lost to the outside universe.", "problem": "In the framework of general relativity, consider two distinct scenarios for the formation of stellar-mass black holes.\n\nIn the first scenario, a massive, non-rotating, primordial star composed almost entirely of hydrogen undergoes gravitational collapse to form a black hole, which we will call `BH_H`.\n\nIn the second scenario, a different non-rotating star, which has completed its stellar nucleosynthesis and is primarily composed of carbon, collapses to form a black hole, `BH_C`.\n\nAfter both collapse events are complete and the resulting black holes have settled into a final, stable, and electrically neutral state, meticulous astronomical observations reveal that they have the exact same mass, $M$. Since both progenitor stars were non-rotating, the final black holes also have zero angular momentum.\n\nBased on these facts, how does the external gravitational field produced by `BH_H` compare to the external gravitational field produced by `BH_C` at some large distance $r$ from their respective centers?\n\nA. The gravitational field of `BH_C` is stronger. The higher nucleon-to-electron ratio in carbon compared to hydrogen results in a subtle difference in the stress-energy tensor that persists after collapse.\n\nB. The gravitational fields are identical. The external properties of a stationary black hole are uniquely determined by a small set of conserved quantities.\n\nC. The gravitational field of `BH_H` is stronger. The simpler composition (mostly protons and electrons) leads to a less complex collapse, preserving more of the initial gravitational potential energy in the external field.\n\nD. It is impossible to determine the relationship without more information. The final gravitational field depends on the complex details of the collapse dynamics and the equation of state of the matter involved.\n\nE. The fields are initially identical but will diverge over time. The difference in their original baryon number will lead to different rates of Hawking radiation, causing their masses to evolve differently.", "solution": "We are told that both final black holes are stationary, neutral, and non-rotating, and that careful observation shows they have the same mass $M$. In general relativity, the exterior spacetime of an isolated, stationary, asymptotically flat black hole is uniquely characterized by its conserved charges: mass $M$, angular momentum $J$, and electric charge $Q$. This is the black hole no-hair theorem, which states that all other information about the progenitor (such as composition, equation of state, baryon number, or collapse details) does not appear in the exterior metric once the black hole has settled.\n\nSpecializing to the present case with $J=0$ and $Q=0$, the unique exterior vacuum solution is the Schwarzschild metric with mass parameter $M$:\n$$\nds^{2} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2 G M}{c^{2} r}\\right) c^{2} dt^{2} + \\left(1 - \\frac{2 G M}{c^{2} r}\\right)^{-1} dr^{2} + r^{2} d\\Omega^{2}.\n$$\nBy Birkhoff’s theorem, any spherically symmetric vacuum solution is necessarily static and of the Schwarzschild form with a single parameter $M$, independent of the matter’s internal composition. Even if the collapse is not perfectly spherically symmetric, the black hole will radiate away higher multipole moments during ringdown and settle into the Schwarzschild solution determined solely by $M$ when $J=Q=0$.\n\nAt large radius $r$, the Schwarzschild metric reduces to the Newtonian limit, yielding the gravitational potential and field\n$$\n\\Phi(r) = -\\frac{G M}{r}, \\quad |\\mathbf{g}(r)| = \\frac{G M}{r^{2}},\n$$\nwhich depend only on $M$. Since both black holes have the same $M$, their external gravitational fields are identical at any $r$ outside the horizon, in particular at large $r$.\n\nAddressing the options:\n- Option A is incorrect because any composition-dependent details of the stress-energy tensor are either radiated away or hidden behind the event horizon; the external vacuum solution depends only on $M$, $J$, $Q$.\n- Option C is incorrect; the complexity of collapse does not imprint on the stationary exterior geometry beyond $M$, $J$, $Q$.\n- Option D is incorrect; no further information is needed once $M$, $J$, $Q$ are specified.\n- Option E is incorrect; the Hawking emission power for a neutral, non-rotating black hole depends only on $M$, scaling as $P \\propto \\hbar c^{6}/(G^{2} M^{2})$. With equal $M$, both evaporate identically, and baryon number does not affect the exterior field or evaporation rate.\n\nTherefore, the external gravitational fields are identical, as guaranteed by the no-hair theorem and Birkhoff’s theorem for the $J=Q=0$ case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1869324"}, {"introduction": "While the no-hair theorem describes the final state of a black hole, it doesn't mean the initial complexities vanish instantaneously. The \"hair\" is shed through a dynamic process called ringdown, where the black hole radiates away asymmetries as gravitational waves. This practice [@problem_id:1869308] allows you to explore the physics of this process by calculating the characteristic timescale over which a black hole \"forgets\" its initial shape, providing a quantitative glimpse into how it settles into its final, serene state.", "problem": "Two distant, non-rotating clouds of dust, designated A and B, possess identical mass $M$. Cloud A has a prolate (cigar-like) spheroid shape, while cloud B has an oblate (pancake-like) spheroid shape. Both clouds undergo gravitational collapse to form non-rotating black holes.\n\nAccording to the no-hair theorem, the final equilibrium state of both systems will be a static, uncharged black hole, which is uniquely described by its mass $M$ (a Schwarzschild black hole). The information about the initial shape of the collapsing cloud, which can be characterized by a mass quadrupole moment, is not retained by the final black hole. This \"hair\" is radiated away, predominantly in the form of gravitational waves, during a phase known as the black hole ringdown. After this phase, the external spacetime geometries of the two black holes become indistinguishable.\n\nThe decay of the gravitational field perturbations during ringdown can be modeled by a set of quasinormal modes. The dominant and longest-lasting component corresponds to the fundamental ($n=0$) quadrupole ($l=2$) mode. The time evolution of the mode's amplitude is proportional to $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$, and the mode's amplitude is observed to decay as $A(t) \\propto \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $\\tau$ is the characteristic e-folding time.
