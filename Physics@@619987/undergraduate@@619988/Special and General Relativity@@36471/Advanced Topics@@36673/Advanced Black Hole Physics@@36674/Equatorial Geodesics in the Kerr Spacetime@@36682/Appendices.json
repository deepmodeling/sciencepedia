The black hole is characterized by its mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$. All calculations are to be performed in geometrized units, where the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1.\n\nThe stability of such circular orbits depends on the radial coordinate $r$. An orbit is stable only if its radius is greater than or equal to the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO).

Therefore, the value of $a/M$ that solves $r_{\\text{ISCO}} = 2M$ will be the minimum value for which any larger spin will result in an ISCO radius smaller than $2M$.\n\nThe equation for the prograde ISCO radius is given by selecting the lower ($+$) sign in the provided formula:\n$$r^2 - 6Mr + 8a\\sqrt{Mr} - 3a^2 = 0$$\n\nWe need to find the value of $a$ for which the solution to this equation is $r = r_S = 2M$.
