To solve this, we must understand the unique physical properties of the ergosphere.\n\nA Kerr black hole is characterized by its mass $M$ and its spin parameter $a$. It has two key boundaries: the outer event horizon at radius $r_+ = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2}$ (in geometrized units) and the static limit, which is the outer boundary of the ergosphere, at a radius $r_S(\\theta) = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2 \\cos^2(\\theta)}$, where $\\theta$ is the polar angle. The ergosphere is the region between these two surfaces, i.e., $r_+ < r < r_S(\\theta)$.\n\nThe defining characteristic of the ergosphere is the phenomenon of extreme \"frame-dragging\". Spacetime within the ergosphere is dragged along by the black hole's rotation so violently that it is impossible for any massive or massless particle to remain at rest with respect to a distant observer (i.e., to be stationary). An object at rest would have constant spatial coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinate system, which is anchored to the distant stars. However, inside the ergosphere, any physical trajectory must have a changing angular coordinate $\\phi$ in the direction of the black hole's rotation. No amount of engine thrust can counteract this dragging of spacetime itself.\n\nLet's analyze the proposed options based on this principle:\n\nA. Turning off the engines and observing the orbit is not a definitive test. Objects will orbit a black hole due to gravity both inside and outside the ergosphere. Orbital trajectories in the strong-field region near a Kerr black hole are non-Keplerian, but this is true for regions outside the ergosphere as well. Without knowledge of $M$ and $a$, the astronaut cannot use the orbital parameters to distinguish between being inside or outside the ergosphere.\n\nB. This procedure directly tests the defining property of the ergosphere. The astronaut attempts to hold the spacecraft stationary with respect to the distant stars, meaning they try to keep their coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ constant. If they are outside the ergosphere, this is possible with sufficient engine thrust to counteract the gravitational pull and the milder frame-dragging. However, if they are inside the ergosphere, it is fundamentally impossible to remain stationary. The spacecraft will be uncontrollably dragged in the direction of rotation, meaning its azimuthal angle $\\phi$ will change, regardless of how much thrust is applied. If the engines fail to keep the spacecraft from rotating with the black hole, the astronaut can definitively conclude they are inside the ergosphere. This is a conclusive, binary test.\n\nC. Measuring tidal forces is not a definitive test. Strong tidal forces exist near any massive object, whether it is rotating or not. While the tidal forces are immense near a black hole, there is no sudden change or unique signature at the boundary of the ergosphere that distinguishes it from a point just outside it, or from a point near a non-rotating (Schwarzschild) black hole. Therefore, measuring tidal forces does not provide conclusive evidence of being inside the ergosphere.\n\nD. Firing a laser pulse outwards is a test for being inside the event horizon, not the ergosphere. The event horizon is the surface of no return. From any location inside the event horizon, no signal can escape. The ergosphere, however, lies *outside* the event horizon. It is entirely possible to escape from the ergosphere, as long as one has not crossed the event horizon. Thus, if the laser pulse escapes, it only confirms that the spacecraft is outside the event horizon, but it doesn't tell whether it is inside or outside the ergosphere.\n\nE. Measuring the precession of gyroscopes relates to the Lense-Thirring effect, which is a manifestation of frame-dragging. This effect occurs both inside and outside the ergosphere, gradually increasing in strength as one approaches the black hole. While the rate of precession would be very high inside the ergosphere, it is a continuous effect. Without knowing the black hole's parameters ($M$ and $a$) and the spacecraft's exact position, the astronaut cannot know the expected precession rate at the ergosphere's boundary. A measurement of a high precession rate is not by itself a definitive yes/no answer to the question of being inside the ergosphere.\n\nTherefore, the only experiment that provides a definitive, unambiguous answer is to test the very possibility of remaining stationary.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1849933"}, {"introduction": "General relativity places a limit on how fast a black hole can spin, a scenario known as the extremal limit where the spin parameter $a$ equals the mass $M$.

The spacetime geometry of such an object is uniquely defined by its mass $M$ and its spin parameter $a$. Two key surfaces define its structure: the event horizon and the static limit surface.\n\nThe radius of the outer event horizon, $r_{H}$, which represents the boundary from which nothing can escape, is given by the larger root of the equation $r^2 - 2Mr + a^2 = 0$. This yields $r_{H} = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2}$.\n\nThe static limit surface defines the outer boundary of a region called the ergosphere. Inside this region, all matter is forced to co-rotate with the black hole.

We are interested in the location where the surfaces touch, which the problem states is along the axis of rotation. The axis of rotation corresponds to polar angles $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = \\pi$.\n\nOur strategy is to evaluate the radii of both surfaces under the given conditions and find the value where they are equal.\n\nLet's start by calculating the radius of the event horizon for an extremal black hole. We substitute the condition $a=M$ into the formula for $r_{H}$:\n$$r_{H} = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - M^2}$$\n$$r_{H} = M + \\sqrt{0}$$\n$$r_{H} = M$$\nFor an extremal Kerr black hole, the inner and outer horizons merge into a single event horizon located at a constant coordinate radius of $r=M$.\n\nNext, let's determine the radius of the static limit surface along the axis of rotation. The axis of rotation is defined by $\\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = \\pi$. At these angles, $\\cos(\\theta)$ is either $1$ or $-1$. In either case, $\\cos^2(\\theta) = (\\pm 1)^2 = 1$.\nWe substitute $\\cos^2(\\theta) = 1$ into the formula for $r_{S}(\\theta)$:\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2 (1)}$$\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - a^2}$$\nThis expression gives the radius of the static limit surface at the poles for any Kerr black hole.\n\nNow, we apply the extremal condition ($a=M$) to this result:\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M + \\sqrt{M^2 - M^2}$$\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M + \\sqrt{0}$$\n$$r_{S}(\\theta=0 \\text{ or } \\pi) = M$$\n\nBy comparing the results, we can see that for an extremal black hole, the event horizon radius is $r_{H} = M$ and the radius of the static limit surface along the axis of rotation is also $r_{S} = M$.
