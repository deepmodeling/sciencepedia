This split is designed to be maximally efficient for energy extraction. The propellant is fired into the black hole on a special \"horizon-skimming\" trajectory. For any particle on such a trajectory, its energy $E_2$ and angular momentum $L_2$ (as measured by a distant stationary observer) are related by the equation $E_2 = \\Omega_H L_2$.

The initial total energy of the probe, falling from rest at infinity, is $E_0 = M_0 c^2$. After the split, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the payload ($E_1$) and the propellant ($E_2$).\nThe conservation law is:\n$$E_0 = E_1 + E_2$$\nWe need to solve for $E_1$:\n$$E_1 = E_0 - E_2$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $E_0$ and $E_2$:\n$$E_1 = (M_0 c^2) - \\left(-\\frac{\\beta M_0 c^2}{2}\\right)$$\n$$E_1 = M_0 c^2 + \\frac{\\beta M_0 c^2}{2}$$\nFactoring out the common term $M_0 c^2$, we arrive at the final expression for the energy of the escaping payload:\n$$E_1 = M_0 c^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\right)$$\nThe energy of the escaping payload is greater than the initial rest energy of the probe by a factor determined by the propulsion tuning parameter $\\beta$.
