The beacon emits the signal at a constant proper frequency. The observer at infinity will measure a gravitationally redshifted frequency. There exists a specific radial coordinate for the beacon, below which any emitted signal would be so extremely redshifted that its frequency would measure as zero to the distant observer, rendering communication impossible.

This is equivalent to finding the location of the infinite redshift surface.\n\nThe gravitational redshift relates the frequency of a light signal as measured by an emitter ($\\nu_e$) and an observer ($\\nu_{obs}$) who are stationary in a static spacetime. The relationship is given by the ratio of the square roots of the time-time component of the metric, $g_{tt}$, at their respective locations. The formula is:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu_{obs}}{\\nu_e} = \\frac{\\sqrt{-g_{tt}(r_e)}}{\\sqrt{-g_{tt}(r_{obs})}} $$\nFrom the given line element, the time-time component of the metric is:\n$$ g_{tt}(r) = -\\left(1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}\\right) $$\nTherefore, $\\sqrt{-g_{tt}(r)}$ is:\n$$ \\sqrt{-g_{tt}(r)} = \\sqrt{-\\left(-\\left(1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}\\right)\\right)} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r^2}} $$\nThe emitter is located at a radial coordinate $r_e$.

Setting $\\nu_{obs} = 0$ in the above equation, we get:\n$$ 0 = \\nu_e \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r_e^2}} $$\nSince the beacon emits at a non-zero proper frequency ($\\nu_e \\neq 0$), the term under the square root must be zero for this equation to hold:\n$$ \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r_e^2}} = 0 $$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{r_0^2}{r_e^2} = 0 $$\nWe can now solve for the critical radial coordinate $r_e$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{r_0^2}{r_e^2} $$\n$$ r_e^2 = r_0^2 $$\nSince a radial coordinate must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$ r_e = r_0 $$\nThus, the critical radial coordinate where the observed frequency drops to zero is $r_0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{r_0}$$", "id": "1865340"}, {"introduction": "With the definition of the infinite redshift surface established, we can now explore its profound consequences for energy and communication.
