We are left with evaluating the integrals of $(t')^{-2/3}$. The indefinite integral is $\\int (t')^{-2/3} dt' = \\frac{(t')^{1/3}}{1/3} = 3(t')^{1/3}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the definite integrals:\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is:\n$$[3(t')^{1/3}]_{t_e}^{t_0} = 3(t_0^{1/3} - t_e^{1/3})$$\nThe right-hand side (RHS) is:\n$$[3(t')^{1/3}]_{0}^{t_e} = 3(t_e^{1/3} - 0^{1/3}) = 3t_e^{1/3}$$\nThe inequality becomes:\n$$3(t_0^{1/3} - t_e^{1/3}) > 3t_e^{1/3}$$\n$$t_0^{1/3} - t_e^{1/3} > t_e^{1/3}$$\n$$t_0^{1/3} > 2t_e^{1/3}$$\nRaising both sides to the power of 3, we get:\n$$t_0 > 8t_e \\implies \\frac{t_0}{t_e} > 8$$\nNow we must relate this ratio of times to the observable redshift $z$.

This means that in Model A, the particle horizon has an infinite proper size at any time $t_e > 0$.\nThe distance to the galaxy, $d_G(t_e)$, is based on the integral $\\int_{t_e}^{t_0} (t')^{-2} dt'$, which is finite for any $0 < t_e < t_0$.\nThe condition $d_G(t_e) > d_H(t_e)$ becomes the statement that a finite distance is greater than an infinite distance. This is impossible.\nTherefore, for the accelerating Model A, it is never possible for an observed galaxy to have been outside our particle horizon at the time of emission.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCombining the results for both models:\n-   In Model D, the condition is met for $z > 3$.\n-   In Model A, the condition can never be met.\n\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1820137"}]}
