For modeling purposes, the nebula can be treated as a \"dust cloud\"â€”a uniform distribution of non-interacting particles. In the reference frame where the cloud is at rest, which we call frame $S$, the dust has a constant proper mass density $\\rho_0$.\n\nThe probe moves at a constant, relativistic velocity of magnitude $v$ with respect to frame $S$. An observer on the probe wishes to determine the characteristics of the interstellar medium from their moving reference frame, $S'$. One of the fundamental quantities they measure is the energy density.\n\nFind a closed-form analytic expression for the energy density of the dust cloud as measured by the observer on the moving probe. Express your answer in terms of the proper mass density $\\rho_0$, the probe's speed $v$, and the speed of light in vacuum $c$.", "solution": "Let $S$ be the rest frame of the dust cloud and $S'$ be the reference frame of the moving probe. The probe moves with velocity $v$ along the positive x-axis of frame $S$ without loss of generality. We need to find the energy density in frame $S'$. The energy density is the $T^{0'0'}$ component of the stress-energy tensor $T^{\\mu'\\nu'}$ in the primed frame.\n\nFirst, we write down the stress-energy tensor for the dust cloud in its own rest frame, $S$. For a perfect fluid, the stress-energy tensor is given by $T^{\\mu\\nu} = (\\rho + p/c^2)U^\\mu U^\\nu + p g^{\\mu\\nu}$, where $\\rho$ is the proper mass density, $p$ is the pressure, $U^\\mu$ is the four-velocity, and $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is the metric tensor. For \"dust,\" the pressure $p=0$. The proper mass density is given as $\\rho_0$. Therefore, the tensor simplifies to $T^{\\mu\\nu} = \\rho_0 U^\\mu U^\\nu$. We use the $(-1, +1, +1, +1)$ Minkowski metric signature, where the four-velocity is normalized such that $U_\\mu U^\\mu = -c^2$.\n\nIn the rest frame $S$, the dust is stationary, so its four-velocity is $U^\\mu_S = (c, 0, 0, 0)$. The stress-energy tensor in frame $S$ is then:\n$T^{00} = \\rho_0 (U^0)^2 = \\rho_0 c^2$.\nAll other components $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ for $(\\mu, \\nu) \\neq (0, 0)$ are zero. So, the only non-zero component of the stress-energy tensor in the rest frame is the energy density $T^{00} = \\rho_0 c^2$.\n\nNext, we need to transform this tensor into the probe's frame, $S'$. The stress-energy tensor transforms according to the rule:\n$$T^{\\mu'\\nu'} = \\Lambda^{\\mu'}_{\\alpha} \\Lambda^{\\nu'}_{\\beta} T^{\\alpha\\beta}$$\nwhere $\\Lambda^{\\mu'}_{\\alpha}$ is the Lorentz transformation matrix for a boost from $S$ to $S'$. For a boost with velocity $v$ along the x-axis, this matrix is:\n$$ \\Lambda^{\\mu'}_{\\alpha} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma  -\\gamma\\beta  0  0 \\\\ -\\gamma\\beta  \\gamma  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$ and $\\gamma = (1 - \\beta^2)^{-1/2} = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$.\n\nWe are interested in the energy density in frame $S'$, which is the component $T^{0'0'}$. Using the transformation law:\n$$T^{0'0'} = \\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{3} \\sum_{\\beta=0}^{3} \\Lambda^{0'}_{\\alpha} \\Lambda^{0'}_{\\beta} T^{\\alpha\\beta}$$\nSince the only non-zero component in the unprimed frame is $T^{00} = \\rho_0 c^2$, the double summation collapses to a single term where $\\alpha=0$ and $\\beta=0$:\n$$T^{0'0'} = \\Lambda^{0'}_{0} \\Lambda^{0'}_{0} T^{00}$$\nFrom the Lorentz transformation matrix, the component $\\Lambda^{0'}_{0}$ is the entry in the first row and first column, which is $\\gamma$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get:\n$$T^{0'0'} = (\\gamma)(\\gamma)(\\rho_0 c^2) = \\gamma^2 \\rho_0 c^2$$\nThe energy density measured by the observer on the probe, which we can call $\\rho'_E$, is therefore $T^{0'0'}$. Substituting the full expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$\\rho'_E = \\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} \\rho_0 c^2 = \\frac{\\rho_0 c^2}{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\nThis result shows that the energy density measured by the moving observer is increased by a factor of $\\gamma^2$. This is due to two effects: the energy of each dust particle is increased by a factor of $\\gamma$ (as seen by the moving observer), and the number density of particles is also increased by a factor of $\\gamma$ due to length contraction of the volume they occupy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\rho_{0} c^{2}}{1 - \\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}$$", "id": "1860468"}, {"introduction": "Building on the single-cloud model, this practice introduces a more complex system of two non-interacting dust streams.
