The star undergoes a purely radial pulsation, meaning its radius $R(t)$ varies with time as measured by a comoving observer on the star's surface, while the star maintains perfect spherical symmetry at all times. The region of spacetime outside the star is a complete vacuum. An astrophysicist at a distant observatory, situated effectively at future null infinity ($\\mathcal{I}^+$), analyzes the spacetime using the Bondi-Sachs formalism. In this framework, the \"news function\", denoted by $N(u, \\theta, \\phi)$, where $u$ is the retarded time and $(\\theta, \\phi)$ are standard spherical coordinates, quantifies the outgoing gravitational radiation.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the news function $N(u, \\theta, \\phi)$ for this pulsating star?\n\nA. The news function $N$ is a non-zero constant, independent of $u$, $\\theta$, and $\\phi$.\n\nB.

The news function $N$ depends only on the retarded time $u$ and the polar angle $\\theta$, but is independent of the azimuthal angle $\\phi$.", "solution": "We are given a non-rotating star that remains exactly spherically symmetric at all times and undergoes purely radial (monopolar) pulsations, with the exterior spacetime being a complete vacuum. We are asked to determine the Bondi-Sachs news function $N(u,\\theta,\\phi)$ at future null infinity $\\mathcal{I}^{+}$.\n\nFirst, use the global constraint from spherical symmetry in vacuum. By Birkhoff’s theorem, any spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the Einstein equations is locally isometric to a Schwarzschild spacetime with a constant mass parameter $M$. Therefore, for all times during which the exterior is spherically symmetric and vacuum, the exterior metric is exactly Schwarzschild and thus stationary. In particular, there is no time dependence in the exterior metric that could correspond to gravitational radiation. Since the Schwarzschild solution has no gravitational waves, the Weyl curvature has only the Coulomb-type component $\\Psi_{2}$ nonzero and no radiative components; in Newman-Penrose language,\n$$\n\\Psi_{2} = -\\frac{M}{r^{3}}, \\quad \\Psi_{0} = \\Psi_{1} = \\Psi_{3} = \\Psi_{4} = 0.\n$$\nThe vanishing of $\\Psi_{4}$, which encodes outgoing radiation, already implies the absence of gravitational waves and therefore vanishing news.\n\nSecond, translate this to the Bondi-Sachs language at $\\mathcal{I}^{+}$. The news function $N(u, \\theta, \\phi)$ is defined as the time derivative of the asymptotic shear. The presence of outgoing gravitational radiation is equivalent to having a non-zero news function. The Bondi mass-loss formula is\n$$\n\\frac{d M_{B}}{d u} = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi G} \\int_{S^{2}} |N(u, \\theta, \\phi)|^2 \\, d\\Omega,\n$$\nwhere $M_{B}(u)$ is the Bondi mass. Because the exterior metric is Schwarzschild with constant mass parameter by Birkhoff’s theorem, it follows that the Bondi mass $M_{B}$ must be constant in $u$, hence\n$$\n\\frac{d M_{B}}{d u} = 0.\n$$\nSince the integrand $|N(u, \\theta, \\phi)|^2$ is non-negative, the integral can only vanish for all $u$ if the integrand itself is identically zero. Therefore, we must have\n$$\nN(u,\\theta,\\phi) \\equiv 0\n$$\nfor all $u$, $\\theta$, and $\\phi$.\n\nThird, check consistency with multipole structure. Gravitational radiation requires time-varying mass quadrupole or higher moments. A strictly spherically symmetric configuration has only the monopole $(\\ell=0)$ moment, which is conserved in vacuum and cannot radiate. All higher multipole moments ($\\ell \\ge 1$) are zero, so no radiation is possible.\n\nConsequently, the correct statement is that the news function vanishes identically for all retarded times and angles. Among the options, this corresponds to C. The alternatives are excluded because:\n- A implies continuous mass loss at a constant rate, contradicting Birkhoff’s theorem and the absence of radiation.\n- B asserts nonzero oscillatory news carrying energy away, which is forbidden in exact spherical symmetry.\n- D suggests impulsive radiation at special times, also forbidden by spherical symmetry in vacuum.\n- E suggests an angular dependence inconsistent with exact spherical symmetry and the vanishing of all radiative multipoles.\n\nTherefore, $N(u,\\theta,\\phi) \\equiv 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1816182"}, {"introduction": "Once a system radiates, its Bondi mass $M_B(u)$ decreases over retarded time.
