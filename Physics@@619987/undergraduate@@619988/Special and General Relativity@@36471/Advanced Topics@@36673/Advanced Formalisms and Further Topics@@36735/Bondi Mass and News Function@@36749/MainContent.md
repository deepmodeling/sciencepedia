## Introduction
In classical physics, mass is a constant property of an object. Even with Einstein's discovery that mass is a form of energy ($E = mc^2$), the total mass-energy of an isolated system was considered conserved. However, general relativity reveals a more complex reality. For dynamic systems like two merging black holes, energy is radiated away as gravitational waves, meaning the system's total mass must decrease. How, then, can we define and track the mass of a system that is constantly radiating its own substance into the cosmos? This question requires a new, more dynamic concept of mass.

This article addresses this fundamental problem by introducing the elegant framework of the Bondi mass and the [news function](@article_id:260268). Across the following chapters, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of this cornerstone of modern relativity. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will explore the theoretical foundation of these concepts, defining mass at the boundary of spacetime and uncovering the physical meaning of "news." We will then dive into "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," discovering how this formalism allows astrophysicists to decode signals from cataclysmic events and probe deep mysteries like the [black hole information paradox](@article_id:139646). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will provide an opportunity to apply these ideas to concrete physical scenarios. Let's begin our journey by building a new understanding of mass for a universe in constant motion.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In our journey to understand the universe, few concepts are as foundational as mass and energy. In the physics of Isaac Newton, mass was a simple, steadfast property of an object. You could move it, spin it, or heat it, but its mass remained an immutable label. Einstein's famous equation, $E = mc^2$, revealed a deep and startling connection: mass is a form of energy. But even then, for an [isolated system](@article_id:141573), the total mass-energy was thought to be conserved. It couldn't just vanish.

General relativity, however, paints a more dynamic and interesting picture. Imagine two colossal black holes, locked in a frenzied gravitational dance, spiraling towards each other. They are shaking the very fabric of spacetime, sending out ripples of gravitational waves. These waves carry energy. And if energy is leaving the system, its mass *must* be decreasing. But how can we talk about the "mass" of a system that is constantly changing and radiating its very substance away? This is not a question Newton's physics could even ask, let alone answer. To tackle it, we need a new, more dynamic idea of mass.

### A Mass for a Dynamic Universe: The Bondi Mass

To measure the mass of a radiating system, we must be clever about *where* we look. If a bonfire is radiating light and heat, you can't measure the total energy it's putting out by just standing in one spot. You need to account for all the energy flowing outwards in all directions. The same is true for a gravitational source. The "stuff" carrying energy away—the gravitational waves—travels at the speed of light. To capture the total energy loss, we must go to the place where all outgoing light rays and gravitational waves ultimately end up.

In the language of relativity, this destination is a beautiful concept known as **[future null infinity](@article_id:261031)**, or $\mathcal{I}^+$. It isn't a physical place you can travel to, but rather the ultimate boundary of spacetime as seen by light rays. By defining the mass of our system on this boundary, we are essentially positioning our cosmic detectors to catch every bit of energy that escapes. This is the physical motivation behind defining mass at $\mathcal{I}^+$ [@problem_id:1816178].

The result is the **Bondi mass**, denoted $M_B(u)$. It represents the total mass-energy of the system as measured at [future null infinity](@article_id:261031). The variable $u$ is the **[retarded time](@article_id:273539)**, which you can think of as a label for outgoing "flashes" of light (or gravitational waves) leaving the source. A flash leaving at a later time will have a larger value of $u$. Because the system can radiate energy, the Bondi mass is not a constant; it is a function of this [retarded time](@article_id:273539), $M_B(u)$. If energy is radiated between time $u_1$ and $u_2$, then $M_B(u_2)$ will be less than $M_B(u_1)$.

### The Bearer of Bad News: The News Function

If the Bondi mass changes, something must be causing the change. This brings us to one of the most wonderfully named concepts in physics: the **[news function](@article_id:260268)**, often written as $N(u, \theta, \phi)$. The name is brilliantly descriptive. If a source is perfectly static and unchanging—say, a single, non-rotating black hole—there is no "news" to report. The gravitational field is stationary, and the [news function](@article_id:260268) is zero. But if the source has dynamics—if our black holes are orbiting and merging—then there is a constant stream of new information about their changing configuration. This "news" propagates outwards at the speed of light, and the [news function](@article_id:260268) is its mathematical description. A non-zero [news function](@article_id:260268) is the definitive signature of gravitational waves.

But what *is* this news, geometrically? Imagine a perfectly spherical pulse of light expanding from a point in empty space. It remains a perfect sphere as it grows. Now, if this light pulse travels through the spacetime of a dynamic source, the gravitational field will distort its shape. This distortion of the wavefront is called **shear**. The [news function](@article_id:260268), it turns out, is simply the **time rate of change of this [asymptotic shear](@article_id:261317)** [@problem_id:1816192] [@problem_id:1816183]. If the shear pattern is changing from moment to moment, it means information about the source's activity is being carried away on the [wavefront](@article_id:197462). That changing pattern *is* the news.

The [news function](@article_id:260268) is a complex-valued field, $N = \text{Re}[N] + i \, \text{Im}[N]$. This isn't just a mathematical quirk; it's deeply physical. Gravitational waves, like light waves, have polarizations—two independent ways they can distort spacetime. These are called the 'plus' ($h_+$) and 'cross' ($h_\times$) polarizations. The [real and imaginary parts](@article_id:163731) of the [news function](@article_id:260268) are directly related to the time derivatives of these two polarization amplitudes [@problem_id:1816160].

### The Law of Mass Loss

We now have the two key players: the Bondi mass, which tells us the system's energy content, and the [news function](@article_id:260268), which tells us if gravitational waves are being emitted. The connection between them is the magnificent **Bondi mass-loss formula**:

$$ \frac{dM_B}{du} = - \frac{1}{4\pi G} \int_{S^2} |N(u, \theta, \phi)|^2 d\Omega $$

Let's take this apart, piece by piece, as it is a masterclass in physical principles.

First, the minus sign is crucial. It tells us that if the [news function](@article_id:260268) $N$ is non-zero, the Bondi mass must *decrease*. Energy is being radiated away, and the source is losing mass. The system can never gain mass from this process; you can't have "anti-radiation."

Second, and most profoundly, is the dependence on the modulus squared of the news, $|N|^2$. Why not just $N$? This is a universal feature of all waves [@problem_id:1816159]. The energy carried by a wave—be it a sound wave, a light wave, or a gravitational wave—is always proportional to the square of its amplitude. Think of the loudness of a sound or the brightness of a light. A wave's amplitude can be positive or negative (a crest or a trough), but the energy it carries must always be positive. Squaring the amplitude ensures this. Whether the spacetime fabric is stretched or squeezed, it carries energy outwards. The $|N|^2$ term guarantees that the energy flow is always positive and away from the source.

Finally, the integral $\int_{S^2} ... d\Omega$ instructs us to sum the squared news over the entire [celestial sphere](@article_id:157774). This is because the radiation is generally not emitted equally in all directions. A spiraling binary system might radiate most strongly in directions perpendicular to its orbital plane. To get the total power output, we must add up the contributions from all directions $(\theta, \phi)$. Different radiation patterns, described by different functions of $\theta$ and $\phi$, can lead to vastly different rates of energy loss, even if their peak amplitude is the same in one direction [@problem_id:1816164].

### A Cosmic Energy Budget

With this powerful formula, we can build a complete [energy budget](@article_id:200533) for any radiating system.

A fascinating insight comes from looking at the instantaneous rate of loss. Let's consider a gravitational wave passing by. The strain, $h_+$, measures the amount of stretching or squeezing of spacetime. You might think that the energy loss is greatest when this stretching is at its maximum. But that's not right! The [news function](@article_id:260268) is related to the *time derivative* of the strain, $\text{Re}[N] = \partial h_+ / \partial u$. When the strain $h_+$ is at a maximum or a minimum, its rate of change is momentarily zero. At that instant, the [news function](@article_id:260268) is zero, and according to our formula, the rate of mass loss is also zero! [@problem_id:1816160]. The energy is carried in the *wiggling* of spacetime, not in its static displacement. The energy flows most strongly when the spacetime is changing most rapidly.

While the instantaneous rate is revealing, the real power comes from looking at the total change over an entire event. By integrating the mass-loss formula over the duration of a gravitational wave burst, we can calculate the total mass lost, $\Delta M_B$. This is precisely the total energy radiated away by the waves, divided by $c^2$. For any hypothetical burst of radiation, we can calculate exactly how much of the source's mass is converted into the pure energy of gravitational waves [@problem_id:1816213] [@problem_id:1816223].

This brings us to a final, beautiful piece of consistency. For any isolated system that starts and ends in a static state, physicists have another way to define its total mass-energy, the **ADM mass** ($M_{ADM}$). This mass is measured at "spatial infinity" and represents the total, conserved mass-energy of the entire spacetime, including all potential energy that might be radiated away. In the distant past, before our system becomes dynamic, it is static. In this simple state, its Bondi mass is exactly equal to its ADM mass: $M_B(u \to -\infty) = M_{ADM}$. Then, the system does its dance, radiates away an amount of energy $E_{\text{rad}}$, and settles down. The final Bondi mass will be smaller: $M_B(u \to +\infty) = M_B(u \to -\infty) - E_{\text{rad}}/c^2$. The ADM mass, however, remains unchanged because it represents the grand total from the very beginning. This gives us a beautiful and complete accounting statement [@problem_id:1816184]:

$$ M_{ADM} = M_{B, \text{final}} + \frac{E_{\text{rad}}}{c^2} $$

Nature's books are perfectly balanced. The mass lost by the source, as tracked by the Bondi mass, is precisely accounted for by the energy carried to the far corners of the universe by the "news" from the source. What began as a puzzle about a dynamic mass has resolved into a profound and elegant story of energy conservation, written in the language of [spacetime geometry](@article_id:139003).
