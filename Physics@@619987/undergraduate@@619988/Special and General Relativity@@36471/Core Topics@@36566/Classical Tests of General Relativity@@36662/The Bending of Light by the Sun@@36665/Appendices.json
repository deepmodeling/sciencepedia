They are observing a very distant star that, from Earth's perspective, appears to pass very close to the Sun at certain times of the year. According to the theory of General Relativity, the light from this distant star is deflected by the Sun's gravitational field. This deflection angle, denoted by $\\alpha$, is the angle between the star's apparent position and its true position in the sky.

Some time later, a second observation is made when the line of sight to the same star has changed. In this second observation, the light from the star passes the Sun with a new impact parameter, $b_2$, which is found to be exactly three times the initial impact parameter (i.e., $b_2 = 3b_1$).
