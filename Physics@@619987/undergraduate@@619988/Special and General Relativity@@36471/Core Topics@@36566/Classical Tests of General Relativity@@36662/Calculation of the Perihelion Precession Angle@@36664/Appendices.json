Angles are ratios of lengths (arc length to radius) and are therefore dimensionless. So, the dimensions of the left-hand side are $M^0 L^0 T^0$.\n\n$$[\\Delta \\phi] = M^0 L^0 T^0$$\n\nThe right-hand side is $K G^a M^b c^p L^q$. The constant $K$ is given as dimensionless, so its dimension is 1. We can write the dimensions of the right-hand side by substituting the dimensions of each component:\n\n$$[K G^a M^b c^p L^q] = [K] [G]^a [M]^b [c]^p [L]^q$$\n$$[K G^a M^b c^p L^q] = (1) \\cdot (M^{-1} L^3 T^{-2})^a \\cdot (M)^b \\cdot (L T^{-1})^p \\cdot (L)^q$$\n\nNow, we group the base dimensions ($M, L, T$) by adding their exponents:\n$$[K G^a M^b c^p L^q] = (M^{-a}) (L^{3a}) (T^{-2a}) \\cdot (M^b) \\cdot (L^p T^{-p}) \\cdot (L^q)$$\n$$[K G^a M^b c^p L^q] = M^{-a+b} L^{3a+p+q} T^{-2a-p}$$\n\nEquating the dimensions of the left and right sides:\n$$M^0 L^0 T^0 = M^{-a+b} L^{3a+p+q} T^{-2a-p}$$\n\nFor this equality to hold, the exponent of each fundamental dimension must be the same on both sides.

For Time ($T$):  $-2a - p = 0$\n\nWe have three equations but four unknowns ($a, b, p, q$), so we need another piece of information. The problem provides an additional physical constraint: \"the precession effect is directly proportional to the mass $M$ of the star.\" In the formula $\\Delta \\phi = K G^a M^b c^p L^q$, this means the exponent of $M$ must be 1. Therefore, we have our fourth condition:\n4. Physical constraint: $b = 1$\n\nNow we can solve the system.\nSubstitute $b=1$ into equation (1):\n$$-a + 1 = 0 \\implies a = 1$$\n\nNow substitute $a=1$ into equation (3):\n$$-2(1) - p = 0 \\implies p = -2$$\n\nFinally, substitute $a=1$ and $p=-2$ into equation (2):\n$$3(1) + (-2) + q = 0$$\n$$1 + q = 0 \\implies q = -1$$\n\nThus, the unique integer exponents are $a=1$, $b=1$, $p=-2$, and $q=-1$.
