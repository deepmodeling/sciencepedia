To mitigate the adverse physiological effects of zero gravity, the spacecraft maintains a constant linear acceleration to create an artificial gravity environment.

The acceleration vector has a constant magnitude $a$ and is oriented perpendicular to the cabin's width.\n\nAn astronaut inside the cabin decides to perform a fundamental experiment. They mount a laser on one wall, aiming it perfectly horizontally (perpendicular to the direction of acceleration) toward a target on the opposite wall. The light beam is emitted and travels across the cabin. From the perspective of the astronaut inside this accelerating frame, the path of the light appears to be a curve.\n\nYour task is to calculate the vertical deflection of the laser beam from its initial height by the time it reaches the opposite wall.

Let the horizontal axis be $x$ (across the cabin width) and the vertical axis be $y$ (along the acceleration). The spacecraft has constant acceleration of magnitude $a$ along $+y$. Over the short transit time across the cabin, the walls’ vertical motion in this inertial frame is given by uniform acceleration kinematics.\n\nThe laser emits a light pulse exactly horizontally. In this inertial frame, the light travels in a straight line at speed $c$ along the $x$-direction, with trajectory\n$$\nx_{\\gamma}(t) = c t, \\qquad y_{\\gamma}(t) = 0.\n$$\nThe opposite wall is located at fixed horizontal position $x=L$.
