A simple pendulum, consisting of a bob of mass $m$ attached to a massless rod of length $L$, is mounted inside a sealed elevator car. The elevator is initially at rest in a uniform gravitational field with acceleration $g$. For small-angle displacements, the pendulum is observed to oscillate with a period $T_0$.\n\nAt a certain moment, the main support cable of the elevator snaps, and the emergency brakes fail to engage. The elevator car, along with the pendulum inside it, begins to fall freely. An observer and their instruments inside the elevator are unaffected by the fall and proceed to measure the new period of oscillation, $T_{fall}$, for small-angle displacements.\n\nAssuming air resistance on the elevator car is negligible, what is the value of $T_{fall}$?\n\nA. $T_{fall} = T_0$\n\nB. $T_{fall} = \\frac{T_0}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nC.
