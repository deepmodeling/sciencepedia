This first practice explores how our planet's slight deviation from a perfect sphere, known as oblateness, creates a small difference in gravitational potential between the equator and the poles. By calculating the resulting time difference between two high-precision clocks, you will gain a concrete appreciation for the real-world relevance of general relativity and the incredible accuracy of modern timekeeping [@problem_id:1831566].", "problem": "Due to its daily rotation, Earth is not a perfect sphere but an oblate spheroid, with its equatorial radius being slightly larger than its polar radius. This difference in distance from the planet's center results in a variation in the gravitational potential at sea level between the poles and the equator. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, this difference in gravitational potential leads to a phenomenon known as gravitational time dilation, causing clocks to run at slightly different rates.\n\nConsider two identical, highly precise atomic clocks, both stationary at sea level. One clock is placed at the North Pole, and the other is placed on the equator. Assuming the Earth's mass distribution can be modeled as spherically symmetric, your task is to determine the consequence of this oblateness on timekeeping.\n\nCalculate the value of $T_{e} - T_{p}$, where $T_{e}$ is the time elapsed on the equatorial clock and $T_{p}$ is the time elapsed on the polar clock. This difference should be calculated over a period that an observer far from Earth's gravity would measure as exactly one day, $T_{obs} = 86400$ seconds.\n\nFor this problem, you must consider *only* the effect of gravitational time dilation caused by the difference in radii.
