By analyzing a plumb line inside an accelerating vehicle, you will explore how an observer in a closed system can interpret a fictitious force arising from acceleration as an apparent gravitational pull. This practice is fundamental to understanding how gravity can be locally indistinguishable from acceleration, a cornerstone of general relativity.

To determine the vehicle's acceleration, the observer hangs a small mass $m$ from a string of length $L$, creating a simple plumb line. In the accelerating frame of the vehicle, the plumb line hangs stationary at a constant angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vehicle's vertical axis. The local acceleration due to gravity is $g$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the tangent of the angle, $\\tan(\\theta)$, in terms of the given parameters.", "solution": "Consider the frame attached to the accelerating vehicle. In this non-inertial frame, the plumb bob is stationary, so the net force on the mass is zero. The real forces are the weight $m g$ downward and the string tension $T$ along the string; in addition, there is a fictitious (inertial) force of magnitude $m a$ acting opposite the direction of the vehicle’s acceleration. Let the vehicle accelerate horizontally, and let $\\theta$ be the angle the string makes with the vehicle’s vertical.\n\nBy resolving forces along horizontal and vertical axes and applying equilibrium ($\\sum F_{x}=0$, $\\sum F_{y}=0$), we have:\n$$T \\sin(\\theta) = m a,$$\n$$T \\cos(\\theta) = m g.$$\n\nDividing the first equation by the second eliminates $T$ and $m$:\n$$\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{m a}{m g} = \\frac{a}{g}.$$\n\nThus, the tangent of the angle is the ratio of the vehicle’s horizontal acceleration to the gravitational acceleration.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{a}{g}}$$", "id": "1832068"}, {"introduction": "Building on the equivalence of gravity and acceleration, this problem delves into its crucial limitation: locality. While a uniform acceleration can perfectly mimic a uniform gravitational field, real gravitational fields are never truly uniform.
