This conceptual practice explores why a light signal transmitted horizontally between two laboratories at the same altitude experiences no change in frequency. By analyzing this scenario [@problem_id:1831069], you will solidify your understanding that gravitational redshift arises not merely from the presence of a gravitational field, but from the difference in gravitational potential, $\\Delta\\Phi$, between the points of emission and reception.", "problem": "In the context of General Relativity, the frequency of light is affected by the gravitational potential through which it travels. This phenomenon, known as gravitational redshift or blueshift, is crucial for technologies like the Global Positioning System (GPS).\n\nConsider a simplified model where the Earth is a perfect, non-rotating sphere of mass $M$ and radius $R$. Two physics laboratories, Lab A and Lab B, are situated on the Earth's surface. A highly stable laser in Lab A emits a monochromatic beam of light with a frequency $f_{emit}$. A sensitive detector in Lab B measures the frequency of the arriving light, $f_{receive}$.\n\nIn an experiment, the laser beam is transmitted horizontally from Lab A to Lab B, which are separated by a large distance but are at the exact same altitude. The experiment concludes that, after accounting for all other possible effects, there is no gravitational frequency shift, i.e., $f_{receive} = f_{emit}$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical explanation for this observation?\n\nA. The gravitational frequency shift is canceled out by the special relativistic time dilation due to the Earth's rotational speed at the equator.\n\nB. The effect is non-zero but too small to be measured over any terrestrial distance, only becoming significant for light from distant stars.\n\nC. Gravitational frequency shift depends on the difference in gravitational potential between the emission and detection points, which is zero for two points at the same altitude.\n\nD. The photon's path is perpendicular to the gravitational field lines, so the cumulative effect of the gravitational field on its frequency averages to zero over the horizontal path.\n\nE. According to the principle of equivalence, the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from acceleration. Since the laboratories are not accelerating relative to each other, no frequency shift is observed.", "solution": "In a static, spherically symmetric gravitational field described by the Schwarzschild metric, the spacetime admits a timelike Killing vector $\\xi^{\\mu} = (\\partial_{t})^{\\mu}$. For a photon with wave 4-vector $k^{\\mu}$ propagating along a null geodesic, the quantity\n$$\nE \\equiv -k_{\\mu}\\,\\xi^{\\mu}\n$$\nis conserved along the trajectory due to the Killing symmetry. The frequency measured by an observer with 4-velocity $u^{\\mu}$ is proportional to\n$$\nf \\propto -k_{\\mu} u^{\\mu}.\n$$\nFor static observers at fixed $r,\\theta,\\phi$ in Schwarzschild spacetime, the 4-velocity is aligned with the Killing vector,\n$$\nu^{\\mu} = \\frac{\\xi^{\\mu}}{\\sqrt{-\\xi^{2}}},\n$$\nwhere $\\xi^{2} \\equiv g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\xi^{\\mu}\\xi^{\\nu} = g_{tt}$. Therefore,\n$$\nf = \\frac{E}{\\sqrt{-\\xi^{2}}} \\propto \\frac{E}{\\sqrt{-g_{tt}}}.\n$$\nSince $E$ is conserved along the photon's path, the ratio of received to emitted frequency for two static observers is\n$$\n\\frac{f_{\\text{receive}}}{f_{\\text{emit}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{-g_{tt}(x_{\\text{emit}})}{-g_{tt}(x_{\\text{receive}})}}.\n$$\nFor the Schwarzschild metric outside a non-rotating spherical mass,\n$$\ng_{tt}(r) = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2 G M}{c^{2} r}\\right)c^{2},\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\frac{f_{\\text{receive}}}{f_{\\text{emit}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\frac{2 G M}{c^{2} r_{\\text{emit}}}}{1 - \\frac{2 G M}{c^{2} r_{\\text{receive}}}}}.\n$$\nIf the emitter and receiver are at the same altitude on a non-rotating spherical Earth, then $r_{\\text{emit}} = r_{\\text{receive}} = R$, which gives\n$$\n\\frac{f_{\\text{receive}}}{f_{\\text{emit}}} = 1,\n$$\nso $f_{\\text{receive}} = f_{\\text{emit}}$. In the weak-field (Newtonian) limit, this is equivalently expressed by\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta f}{f} \\approx \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{emit}} - \\Phi_{\\text{receive}}}{c^{2}},\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi(r) = -\\frac{G M}{r}$ is the Newtonian potential; if $r_{\\text{emit}} = r_{\\text{receive}}$, then $\\Phi_{\\text{emit}} = \\Phi_{\\text{receive}}$ and the shift is zero.\n\nThis result depends only on the gravitational potential difference between the endpoints and not on the path taken by the light; the horizontal transmission does not affect the frequency shift. Therefore, the correct physical explanation is that gravitational frequency shift depends on the difference in gravitational potential between emission and detection points, which vanishes for two points at the same radius in this model. This directly corresponds to option C. Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect for the following reasons: A invokes cancellation with rotational special relativistic effects, which are outside the stated non-rotating model and are not the fundamental reason; B is false because terrestrial gravitational redshift is measurable when there is a height difference; D incorrectly attributes the result to path orientation rather than endpoint potential difference; E misapplies the equivalence principle, since equal altitude does not generally imply no gravitational redshift unless the potentials are equal, which is the actual condition at play here.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1831069"}, {"introduction": "Now that we've established that potential difference is the cause of gravitational redshift, let's explore how to quantify it.
