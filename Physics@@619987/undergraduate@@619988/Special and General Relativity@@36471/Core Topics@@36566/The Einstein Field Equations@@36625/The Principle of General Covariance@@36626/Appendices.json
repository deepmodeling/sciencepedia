The right-hand side of the equation is not a tensor, while the left-hand side is a tensor.\nB. The left-hand side of the equation, involving a covariant derivative, is not a tensor.\nC.

The problematic factor is the partial derivative of the metric. In curved spacetime, the partial derivative of a tensor is not a tensor.

The incorrect alternatives can be dismissed as follows: the covariant derivative on the left-hand side does produce a tensor, so it is not the source of non-covariance; a constant $k$ is a scalar and does not obstruct covariance; the index structure on the right-hand side leaves a free $\\nu$ as required, so index placement is not the issue; and partial derivatives are defined in any coordinate chart, not only inertial frames. The essential failure is the non-tensorial nature of the right-hand side.\n\nThus, the correct reason is that the right-hand side is not a tensor while the left-hand side is a tensor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1872221"}]}
