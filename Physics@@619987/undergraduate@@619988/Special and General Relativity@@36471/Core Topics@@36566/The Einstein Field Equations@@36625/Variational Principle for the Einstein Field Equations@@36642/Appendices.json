This invariance implies that the Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}$ must itself be a scalar, meaning its value at any spacetime point is independent of the coordinate system used.\n\nA student proposes a trial Lagrangian density for gravity constructed from a vector field $A^\\mu$ and the Christoffel symbols of the second kind, $\\Gamma^\\alpha_{\\mu\\nu}$. The proposed Lagrangian is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{trial}} = A_{\\mu} \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} g^{\\alpha\\beta}\n$$\nwhere $A_\\mu$ is a non-zero covariant vector field.\n\nThe student's supervisor immediately dismisses this Lagrangian density as fundamentally unsuitable for a theory of gravity.

The resulting field equations from varying this action would be first-order differential equations, which is inconsistent with the observed propagation of gravitational waves.\n\nE. The Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{trial}}$ violates the weak equivalence principle because it explicitly depends on the vector field $A_\\mu$.", "solution": "The central issue with the proposed Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{trial}} = A_{\\mu} \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} g^{\\alpha\\beta}$, is its behavior under a general coordinate transformation $x^\\mu \\to x'^\\mu(x)$.

It is defined in terms of derivatives of the metric tensor, but it is famously **not** a tensor. Its components do not follow the tensor transformation law. Instead, they transform according to an affine law:\n$$\n\\Gamma'^{\\lambda}_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial x'^\\lambda}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\frac{\\partial x^\\sigma}{\\partial x'^\\mu} \\frac{\\partial x^\\tau}{\\partial x'^\\nu} \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\sigma\\tau} + \\frac{\\partial x'^\\lambda}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\frac{\\partial^2 x^\\rho}{\\partial x'^\\mu \\partial x'^\\nu}\n$$\nThe presence of the second term, which involves second derivatives of the coordinate transformation, is what makes the Christoffel symbol non-tensorial. This term is often called the inhomogeneous part of the transformation.\n\nNow let's consider the quantity $V^\\mu = \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} g^{\\alpha\\beta}$. If this were a vector, then its contraction with the vector $A_\\mu$ (i.e., $A_\\mu V^\\mu$) would result in a scalar. Let's examine the transformation of $V^\\mu$.\n$$\nV'^\\mu = \\Gamma'^{\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} g'^{\\alpha\\beta}\n$$\nSubstituting the transformation laws for $\\Gamma'$ and $g'$:\n$$\nV'^\\mu = \\left( \\frac{\\partial x'^\\mu}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\frac{\\partial x^\\sigma}{\\partial x'^\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial x^\\tau}{\\partial x'^\\beta} \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\sigma\\tau} + \\frac{\\partial x'^\\mu}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\frac{\\partial^2 x^\\rho}{\\partial x'^\\alpha \\partial x'^\\beta} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\partial x'^\\alpha}{\\partial x^\\zeta} \\frac{\\partial x'^\\beta}{\\partial x^\\eta} g^{\\zeta\\eta} \\right)\n$$\nExpanding this product, the first part gives (using $\\frac{\\partial x^\\sigma}{\\partial x'^\\alpha} \\frac{\\partial x'^\\alpha}{\\partial x^\\zeta} = \\delta^\\sigma_\\zeta$ and $\\frac{\\partial x^\\tau}{\\partial x'^\\beta} \\frac{\\partial x'^\\beta}{\\partial x^\\eta} = \\delta^\\tau_\\eta$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x'^\\mu}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\delta^\\sigma_\\zeta \\delta^\\tau_\\eta \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\sigma\\tau} g^{\\zeta\\eta} = \\frac{\\partial x'^\\mu}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\zeta\\eta} g^{\\zeta\\eta} = \\frac{\\partial x'^\\mu}{\\partial x^\\rho} V^\\rho\n$$\nThis is the expected transformation for a contravariant vector.

The quantity $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{trial}}$ will change its value in a coordinate-dependent way, violating the principle of general covariance. This makes it an invalid Lagrangian density.\n\nNow we evaluate the other options:\n- (B) is incorrect. The quantity $\\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\alpha\\beta} g^{\\alpha\\beta}$ is not generally zero. Using the definition of Christoffel symbols, this can be shown to be related to $g^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\nu(\\ln\\sqrt{-g})$, which is non-zero in most coordinate systems for curved spacetime.\n- (C) is incorrect. While the Einstein-Hilbert action for pure gravity only involves the metric, more general theories (like Einstein-Maxwell theory or theories with scalar fields) couple gravity to other fields. There is no a priori rule forbidding a Lagrangian from containing other fields like $A_\\mu$.\n- (D) is incorrect. A Lagrangian linear in first derivatives of the metric (like the Christoffel symbols) would actually lead to third-order field equations after variation. While this is problematic (often leading to instabilities via the Ostrogradsky theorem), the more fundamental violation is the lack of covariance.\n- (E) is incorrect. The equivalence principle is about the local equivalence of gravity and acceleration and the universal coupling of matter to gravity. While a theory built on this Lagrangian would likely violate it, the primary, mathematical flaw, independent of any physical interpretation, is that the action is not invariant. The lack of scalar nature is a more fundamental and immediate reason for disqualification.\n\nThus, the most fundamental reason for the invalidity of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{trial}}$ is that it is not a scalar due to the non-tensorial nature of the Christoffel symbols.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1881232"}, {"introduction": "The Einstein Field Equations connect spacetime geometry to the distribution of matter and energy, which is encapsulated in the stress-energy tensor, $T_{\\mu\\nu}$.

Proper time is defined by $d\\tau^2 = -g_{\\mu\\nu}dx^\\mu dx^\\nu$. With this choice, the four-velocity $U^\\mu = \\frac{dx^\\mu}{d\\tau}$ is automatically normalized, i.e., $g_{\\mu\\nu}U^\\mu U^\\nu = -1$.\nThe term inside the square root becomes $\\sqrt{-g_{\\mu\\nu}U^\\mu U^\\nu} = \\sqrt{-(-1)} = 1$.\nThe action simplifies to:\n$$S_p = -m \\int d\\tau$$\nNow, we must re-express this in a form that shows the explicit dependence on the metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ before we can vary it.
