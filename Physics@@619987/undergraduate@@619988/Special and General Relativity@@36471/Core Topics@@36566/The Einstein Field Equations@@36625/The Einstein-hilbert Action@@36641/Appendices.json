Its variation with respect to the metric tensor leads to the Einstein field equations. A crucial component of this action is the term $\\sqrt{-g}$, where $g$ is the determinant of the spacetime metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. When performing the variation, it is useful to treat $\\sqrt{-g}$ as a functional of the inverse metric tensor, $g^{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nYour task is to compute the functional derivative of $\\sqrt{-g}$ with respect to the inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$. Express your answer in terms of $g$, $g_{\\mu\\nu}$, and/or $g^{\\mu\\nu}$.", "solution": "Our goal is to compute the functional derivative $\\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{-g}}{\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}}$. We begin by considering the variation of $\\sqrt{-g}$, which we denote as $\\delta\\sqrt{-g}$. Using the standard chain rule for differentials, we have:\n$$\n\\delta\\sqrt{-g} = \\delta((-g)^{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} (-g)^{-1/2} (-\\delta g) = \\frac{-\\delta g}{2\\sqrt{-g}}\n$$\nNow, we need to find an expression for the variation of the determinant, $\\delta g$. For this, we use Jacobi's formula for the derivative of a determinant. For an invertible matrix $M$, the formula states $\\delta(\\det(M)) = \\det(M) \\text{tr}(M^{-1}\\delta M)$. In the context of General Relativity, we identify the matrix $M$ with the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$. The components of the inverse matrix $M^{-1}$ are the components of the inverse metric $g^{\\mu\\nu}$. The trace operation involves summing the diagonal elements, which corresponds to contracting indices. Thus, Jacobi's formula becomes:\n$$\n\\delta g = g \\cdot g^{\\mu\\nu} \\delta g_{\\mu\\nu}\n$$\nThis expression gives the variation of $g$ in terms of the variation of the covariant metric tensor, $\\delta g_{\\mu\\nu}$. However, we need the variation with respect to the contravariant inverse metric, $\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}$. To relate these two variations, we start with the fundamental identity that defines the inverse metric:\n$$\ng_{\\mu\\alpha} g^{\\alpha\\nu} = \\delta_{\\mu}^{\\nu}\n$$\nTaking the variation of this entire equation (and noting that the Kronecker delta $\\delta_{\\mu}^{\\nu}$ is a constant tensor whose components are 0 or 1, so its variation is zero), we get:\n$$\n(\\delta g_{\\mu\\alpha}) g^{\\alpha\\nu} + g_{\\mu\\alpha} (\\delta g^{\\alpha\\nu}) = 0\n$$\nWe can isolate $\\delta g_{\\mu\\alpha}$ by multiplying the equation by $g_{\\nu\\beta}$:\n$$\n(\\delta g_{\\mu\\alpha}) g^{\\alpha\\nu} g_{\\nu\\beta} + g_{\\mu\\alpha} (\\delta g^{\\alpha\\nu}) g_{\\nu\\beta} = 0\n$$\nUsing the property $g^{\\alpha\\nu}g_{\\nu\\beta} = \\delta^{\\alpha}_{\\beta}$, the first term simplifies:\n$$\n(\\delta g_{\\mu\\alpha}) \\delta^{\\alpha}_{\\beta} + g_{\\mu\\alpha} g_{\\nu\\beta} (\\delta g^{\\alpha\\nu}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\delta g_{\\mu\\beta} + g_{\\mu\\alpha} g_{\\nu\\beta} (\\delta g^{\\alpha\\nu}) = 0\n$$\nFrom this, we find the desired relation between the variations:\n$$\n\\delta g_{\\mu\\beta} = -g_{\\mu\\alpha} g_{\\beta\\nu} \\delta g^{\\alpha\\nu}\n$$\nNow we can substitute this expression back into our version of Jacobi's formula. To avoid index collision, we rename the indices in the Jacobi formula as $\\delta g = g \\cdot g^{\\alpha\\beta} \\delta g_{\\alpha\\beta}$:\n$$\n\\delta g = g \\cdot g^{\\alpha\\beta} (-g_{\\alpha\\mu} g_{\\beta\\nu} \\delta g^{\\mu\\nu})\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\delta g = -g \\cdot (g^{\\alpha\\beta} g_{\\alpha\\mu}) g_{\\beta\\nu} \\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}\n$$\nThe term in the parentheses is $g^{\\alpha\\beta} g_{\\alpha\\mu} = \\delta^{\\beta}_{\\mu}$. So the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\delta g = -g \\cdot \\delta^{\\beta}_{\\mu} g_{\\beta\\nu} \\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}\n$$\nContracting with the Kronecker delta gives $\\delta^{\\beta}_{\\mu} g_{\\beta\\nu} = g_{\\mu\\nu}$:\n$$\n\\delta g = -g \\cdot g_{\\mu\\nu} \\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}\n$$\nWe have now expressed $\\delta g$ in terms of $\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}$. We can substitute this back into our initial expression for $\\delta\\sqrt{-g}$:\n$$\n\\delta\\sqrt{-g} = \\frac{-\\delta g}{2\\sqrt{-g}} = \\frac{-(-g \\cdot g_{\\mu\\nu} \\delta g^{\\mu\\nu})}{2\\sqrt{-g}} = \\frac{g \\cdot g_{\\mu\\nu}}{2\\sqrt{-g}} \\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}\n$$\nFor a Lorentzian metric signature, the determinant $g$ is negative. Therefore, we can write $g = -|g| = -(\\sqrt{-g})^2$. Substituting this into the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{g}{2\\sqrt{-g}} = \\frac{-(\\sqrt{-g})^2}{2\\sqrt{-g}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{-g}\n$$\nThis gives the final form for the variation of $\\sqrt{-g}$:\n$$\n\\delta\\sqrt{-g} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{-g} \\, g_{\\mu\\nu} \\, \\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}\n$$\nThe functional derivative $\\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{-g}}{\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}}$ is, by definition, the coefficient of the variation $\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}$ in the expression for $\\delta\\sqrt{-g}$. Therefore, we can directly read off the result:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta \\sqrt{-g}}{\\delta g^{\\mu\\nu}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{-g} \\, g_{\\mu\\nu}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{-g}g_{\\mu\\nu}}$$", "id": "1861245"}, {"introduction": "With the result for the variation of the volume element in hand, we can now tackle the central task: deriving the equations of motion for gravity.
