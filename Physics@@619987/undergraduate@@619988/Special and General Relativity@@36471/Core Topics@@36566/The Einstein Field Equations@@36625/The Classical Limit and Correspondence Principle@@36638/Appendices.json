The kinetic energy $K$ of the particle is defined as the total energy minus its rest energy, i.e., $K = E - mc^2$.\n\nFor particles moving at speeds much less than the speed of light, the kinetic energy is well-approximated by the classical Newtonian expression $K_{classical} = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$. However, as the particle's momentum increases, this approximation breaks down, and corrections from special relativity become significant.\n\nBy expressing the relativistic kinetic energy $K$ as a power series in the particle's momentum $p$, one can identify these corrections.
