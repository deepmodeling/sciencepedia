{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our practical exploration of manifolds, we start with a familiar geometric object: the infinite cylinder. This exercise asks you to think about how we can apply a coordinate system, much like latitude and longitude on a globe, to this surface. By investigating the standard angular and height coordinates, $(\\theta, z)$, you will discover the power and limitations of a single coordinate chart and gain an intuition for why a collection of charts, known as an atlas, is often necessary to describe a whole manifold without ambiguity [@problem_id:1851200].", "problem": "Consider an infinite cylinder of radius $R > 0$ embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The cylinder, denoted by $M$, is the set of points $(x,y,z)$ satisfying the equation $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$. We wish to describe points on this surface using a coordinate system consisting of an angle $\\theta$ and a height $z$.\n\nThis suggests defining a map $\\psi$ from a domain in the $(\\theta, z)$ plane to the cylinder $M$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ given by:\n$$ \\psi(\\theta, z) = (R\\cos\\theta, R\\sin\\theta, z) $$\nThe inverse of this map, $\\phi = \\psi^{-1}$, would then serve as a coordinate chart. For $\\phi$ to be a valid coordinate chart for a region on the cylinder, it must be a homeomorphism from an open subset $U \\subset M$ to an open subset $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$. A key property related to this is that the parameterization map $\\psi$ must be a smooth immersion, meaning its derivative map is injective everywhere on its domain.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the validity of using $(\\theta, z)$ as a coordinate system for the cylinder $M$?\n\nA. The map $\\psi(\\theta, z)$ is not a smooth function because the trigonometric functions are periodic, so $(\\theta, z)$ cannot form a valid coordinate chart on any part of the cylinder.\n\nB. The map $\\psi$ for $(\\theta, z) \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\times (-\\infty, \\infty)$ provides a single, valid coordinate chart that covers the entire cylinder $M$.\n\nC. The tangent vectors corresponding to the coordinates, $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial z}$, are linearly dependent whenever $\\sin\\theta=0$, which prevents the coordinates from forming a valid chart on any region containing these points.\n\nD. A single coordinate chart based on $(\\theta, z)$ can never cover the entire cylinder, but it is possible to define a valid local chart on a proper open subset of the cylinder, for example, by removing a single vertical line.\n\nE. The mapping from the cylinder's $(x,y,z)$ points to the $(\\theta, z)$ coordinates is everywhere discontinuous due to the multi-valued nature of the arctangent function required to find $\\theta$, making it impossible to form a valid chart.", "solution": "We parameterize the cylinder $M=\\{(x,y,z)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}:x^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}\\}$ by\n$$\n\\psi(\\theta,z)=(R\\cos\\theta,R\\sin\\theta,z).\n$$\nFirst, $\\psi$ is smooth because it is built from smooth functions. Its partial derivatives are\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}(\\theta,z)=(-R\\sin\\theta,R\\cos\\theta,0),\\qquad \\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial z}(\\theta,z)=(0,0,1).\n$$\nTo check immersion, we verify linear independence of these two tangent vectors for all $(\\theta,z)$. Suppose $a\\,\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}+b\\,\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial z}=(0,0,0)$. Looking at the third component gives $b=0$.

Therefore $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}$ and $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial z}$ are linearly independent everywhere, so $\\psi$ is a smooth immersion. This directly contradicts the claim in option C that dependence occurs when $\\sin\\theta=0$, since at such $\\theta$ we have $\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}=(0,\\pm R,0)$, which is never a multiple of $(0,0,1)$.\n\nNext consider injectivity and the chart topology. On $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$, $\\psi$ is not injective because $\\psi(\\theta,z)=\\psi(\\theta+2\\pi,z)$ for all $(\\theta,z)$. If we restrict to $[0,2\\pi)\\times\\mathbb{R}$, then $\\psi$ becomes bijective onto $M$ (the seam $\\theta=0$ is included while $\\theta=2\\pi$ is excluded, removing the double representation). However, $[0,2\\pi)\\times\\mathbb{R}$ is not an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, so it cannot serve as the domain $V$ of a valid coordinate chart. Hence option B fails because the chart image in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ must be open.\n\nIf instead we take the open domain $(0,2\\pi)\\times\\mathbb{R}$, then $\\psi$ is smooth and injective, and its image is $M$ with one vertical line removed, namely the set $\\{(R,0,z):z\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}$ corresponding to $\\theta=0$. That removed line is closed in $M$, so its complement is open in $M$. On this open subset, the inverse map is smooth: given $(x,y,z)$ with $(x,y)\\neq (R,0)$ and $x^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}$, there is a unique $\\theta\\in(0,2\\pi)$ such that $\\cos\\theta=\\frac{x}{R}$ and $\\sin\\theta=\\frac{y}{R}$, and then $z$ is the same. This defines a smooth inverse on that open subset. Therefore, $(\\theta,z)$ defines a valid local chart on a proper open subset of the cylinder (for example, the cylinder with a single vertical line removed), but no single chart based on $\\theta$ can cover the entire $M$ with an open domain in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ because covering all angles injectively forces a cut, which makes the $\\theta$-domain non-open if it covers the seam, or leaves out a vertical line if the domain is open. Thus a single $(\\theta,z)$-chart cannot cover all of $M$, though it works locally on $M$ minus a vertical line. This confirms option D.\n\nRegarding the remaining options: option A is false because periodicity does not destroy smoothness; $\\psi$ is smooth. Option E is false because while a globally continuous angle function does not exist on the entire circle, on suitable open subsets (avoiding a radial cut) one can choose a continuous and smooth branch of the angle, yielding valid local charts.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that a single $(\\theta,z)$-based chart cannot cover the entire cylinder, but valid local charts exist on proper open subsets such as the cylinder with one vertical line removed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1851200"}, {"introduction": "A space can look like a line locally at every single point, yet still fail to be a manifold.

The map $h:q((a,b)\\times\\{1\\})\\to(a,b)$ given by $h(q(x,i))=x$ is a well-defined bijection whose inverse $x\\mapsto q(x,1)$ is continuous; by the quotient property, $h$ is continuous because $h\\circ q$ on $q^{-1}(q((a,b)\\times\\{1\\}))$ is the projection onto the first coordinate on each open piece, hence continuous. Thus $[x]$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open interval.\n\nFor $p_{1}$, choose $\\epsilon>0$ and consider $U_{1}=q((-\\epsilon,\\epsilon)\\times\\{1\\})$.

The quotient map $q: X \\to L$ is continuous and surjective by definition. It can also be shown that $q$ is an open map (it maps open sets in $X$ to open sets in $L$). A continuous, open, surjective map from a second-countable space to another preserves the second-countable property. Therefore, $L$ is second-countable.\n\nHausdorff property fails: We show that $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ cannot be separated by disjoint open neighborhoods. Let $U,V\\subset L$ be open with $p_{1}\\in U$ and $p_{2}\\in V$. Then $q^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$ and contains $(0,1)$, so there exist $a<0<b$ with $(a,b)\\times\\{1\\}\\subset q^{-1}(U)$. Since $q^{-1}(U)$ is saturated, for every $x\\in(a,b)\\setminus\\{0\\}$ we also have $(x,2)\\in q^{-1}(U)$. Similarly, there exist $c<0<d$ with $(c,d)\\times\\{2\\}\\subset q^{-1}(V)$ and, by saturation, $(x,1)\\in q^{-1}(V)$ for all $x\\in(c,d)\\setminus\\{0\\}$. The intersection $(a,b)\\cap(c,d)$ contains some nonzero $x$ because both intervals contain $0$; choose such an $x$. Then $(x,1)\\in q^{-1}(U)\\cap q^{-1}(V)$ or equivalently $q(x,1)=q(x,2)\\in U\\cap V$. Hence every pair of open neighborhoods of $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ intersect, so $L$ is not Hausdorff.\n\nConclusion: $L$ is locally Euclidean of dimension $1$ and second-countable, but it is not Hausdorff.
