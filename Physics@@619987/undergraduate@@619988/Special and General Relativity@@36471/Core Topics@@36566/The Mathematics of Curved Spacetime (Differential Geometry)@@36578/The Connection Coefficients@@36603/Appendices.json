The line element is:\n$$\nds^2 = (1)d\\rho^2 + (\\rho^2)d\\phi^2 + (1)dz^2\n$$\nComparing this to the general form, we can write the metric tensor as a matrix:\n$$\ng_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} g_{\\rho\\rho} & g_{\\rho\\phi} & g_{\\rho z} \\\\ g_{\\phi\\rho} & g_{\\phi\\phi} & g_{\\phi z} \\\\ g_{z\\rho} & g_{z\\phi} & g_{zz} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\rho^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe metric is diagonal.
