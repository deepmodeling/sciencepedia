We focus on the first symmetry property, which states the tensor is antisymmetric in its first two indices: $R_{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu} = -R_{\\beta\\alpha\\mu\\nu}$.\nFor the component $R_{ttxy}$, the first two indices are identical. We can set $\\alpha = t$ and $\\beta = t$ in the symmetry rule.

This result holds for any component of the Riemann tensor where the first two indices are identical (or by Symmetry 3, where the last two indices are identical).\n\nNext, let's examine the component $C_1 = R_{xyxt}$. We apply each of the three symmetries to see if they force this component to be zero. The indices are $\\alpha=x$, $\\beta=y$, $\\mu=x$, $\\nu=t$.

This relates $C_1$ to another component, but does not force it to be zero.\n\nNone of the provided symmetries force $C_1 = R_{xyxt}$ to be zero. In a general curved spacetime, components of this form (with non-repeated indices in the first and second pairs) are non-zero. For instance, in the geometry of a sphere, components like $R_{\\theta\\phi\\theta\\phi}$ are non-zero and related to the sphere's radius.
