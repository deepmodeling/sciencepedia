The defining characteristic of a vector is not its appearance, but how its components transform when we change our coordinate system. This first exercise challenges you to move beyond calculation and test this fundamental definition. By checking if a given set of components transforms according to the contravariant transformation law under a simple rotation [@problem_id:1819714], you will develop a deeper conceptual understanding of what it truly means for a quantity to be a vector on a manifold.", "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional Euclidean plane described by a set of Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$.
