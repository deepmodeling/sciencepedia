The Einstein tensor, denoted as $G_{\\mu\\nu}$, is a central object in this theory that describes the curvature of spacetime. In a vacuum, far from any gravitational sources, spacetime is expected to be \"flat,\" a condition mathematically described by the Minkowski metric. For such a flat spacetime, all components of the Einstein tensor should vanish, corresponding to the absence of energy and momentum. This problem involves a direct calculation to verify this property for a specific component.\n\nConsider a 4-dimensional flat spacetime (Minkowski space) described by Cartesian coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, x, y, z)$, where $c$ is the speed of light and $t$ is time. The metric tensor for this spacetime is given by:\n$$g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe definition of the Einstein tensor is:\n$$G_{\\mu\\nu} = R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\mu\\nu} R$$\nwhere $R_{\\mu\\nu}$ is the Ricci tensor and $R$ is the Ricci scalar, given by the trace of the Ricci tensor, $R = g^{\\mu\\nu} R_{\\mu\\nu}$.

The calculation proceeds in a series of steps, starting from the metric tensor and building up to the Einstein tensor.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}$.**\nThe Christoffel symbols are defined as:\n$$\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\lambda\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$$\nThe given metric is the Minkowski metric, $g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$, whose components are all constants (either -1, 1, or 0).\n$$g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSince all components of the metric tensor are constant with respect to the Cartesian coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$, any partial derivative of a metric component will be zero. That is, for all $\\alpha, \\mu, \\nu$:\n$$\\partial_\\alpha g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$$\nSubstituting this into the formula for the Christoffel symbols, the term in the parenthesis becomes zero:\n$$(\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu}) = (0 + 0 - 0) = 0$$\nTherefore, all 64 components of the Christoffel symbol are zero for the Minkowski metric in Cartesian coordinates.\n$$\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\lambda, \\mu, \\nu$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Riemann curvature tensor, $R^\\rho_{\\;\\;\\sigma\\mu\\nu}$.**\nThe Riemann tensor is defined as:\n$$R^\\rho_{\\;\\;\\sigma\\mu\\nu} = \\partial_\\mu \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\nu \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\sigma} + \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\lambda} \\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\nu\\sigma} - \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\lambda} \\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\sigma}$$\nFrom Step 1, we know that all Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu}$ are identically zero. This implies that their partial derivatives are also zero ($\\partial_\\mu \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\sigma} = 0$).
