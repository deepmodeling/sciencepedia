Therefore, we have:\n$$\n\\bar{T}^\\alpha{}_\\beta \\bar{V}^\\beta = \\lambda \\bar{V}^\\alpha\n$$\nComparing this with the eigenvalue equation in the new coordinates, $\\bar{T}^\\alpha{}_\\beta \\bar{V}^\\beta = \\bar{\\lambda} \\bar{V}^\\alpha$, we see that $\\bar{\\lambda} = \\lambda$.\n\nThis means the value of the eigenvalue is the same regardless of the coordinate system used to compute it. A quantity that is invariant under coordinate transformations is, by definition, a scalar. Since the tensor field is defined over a manifold, its eigenvalues can, in general, vary from point to point. Therefore, the eigenvalues are scalar fields. In this specific problem, the tensor components are constant, which means the eigenvalues are also constant across the manifold, making them constant scalar fields.\n\nSo, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 8, \\lambda_2 = -2$, and they are scalar fields.
