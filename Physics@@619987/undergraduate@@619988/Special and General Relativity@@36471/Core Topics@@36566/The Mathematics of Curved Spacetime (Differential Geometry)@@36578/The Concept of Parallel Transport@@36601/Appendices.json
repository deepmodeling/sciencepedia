This exercise explores what happens when you transport a vector along a closed loop, a concept known as holonomy. By examining a path on a cone, you will discover that the net rotation of the vector upon its return is directly related to the curvature enclosed within the pathâ€”in this case, the \"deficit angle\" concentrated at the cone's apex, providing a powerful and intuitive demonstration of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.

The point of the sector becomes the apex of the cone.\n\nAn observer starts at a point $P$ on the joined seam of this cone and carries a vector. The observer then walks along a closed path that encircles the apex once at a constant distance from it, returning to the starting point $P$.

Assume $\\beta$ is also given in radians and satisfies $0  \\beta  2\\pi$.", "solution": "The physical scenario can be understood by \"unrolling\" the cone back into the flat circular sector from which it was made. The key principle is that parallel transport on the cone corresponds to standard Euclidean parallel transport on this flat sector.\n\nStep 1: Set up the geometry.\nLet's place the flat circular sector in a Cartesian plane $(x, y)$ with its apex at the origin $(0,0)$. We can align one radial edge of the sector with the positive x-axis. Since the interior angle of the sector is $\\beta$, the other radial edge will lie along the line making an angle $\\beta$ with the positive x-axis. A point on the surface can be described by polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ on this sector, where $r$ is the distance from the apex and $\\theta$ is the angle, with $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\beta$. The cone is formed by identifying the edge at $\\theta=0$ with the edge at $\\theta=\\beta$.\n\nStep 2: Describe the path and the vector.\nThe closed path on the cone at a constant distance from the apex corresponds to a circular arc on the flat sector at a constant radius, say $r=R$. The path starts at a point $P_i$ on the edge $\\theta=0$ and ends at a point $P_f$ on the edge $\\theta=\\beta$. On the cone, $P_i$ and $P_f$ are the same point $P$.\n\nLet the initial vector be $\\vec{v}_i$. When it is parallel transported on the flat sector, its components in the fixed Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y)$ remain constant. Thus, the vector at the final point $P_f$, denoted $\\vec{v}_f$, is identical to the initial vector $\\vec{v}_i$ in this Cartesian frame: $\\vec{v}_f = \\vec{v}_i$.\n\nStep 3: Compare the initial and final vectors.\nThe challenge is to compare $\\vec{v}_f$ to $\\vec{v}_i$ in the *same* tangent space at point $P$ on the cone. When we unrolled the cone, we split the single tangent space $T_P M$ into two: one at $P_i$ and one at $P_f$. To compare the vectors, we must use the identification map that glues the cone together.\n\nThe identification of the edge at $\\theta=\\beta$ with the edge at $\\theta=0$ corresponds to a rotation of the local coordinate system. A local reference frame at $P_f$ (e.g., the radial and tangential directions) is rotated by an angle $\\beta$ relative to a local reference frame at $P_i$. To compare the final vector $\\vec{v}_f$ with the initial vector $\\vec{v}_i$ in the initial frame at $P_i$, we must rotate the vector $\\vec{v}_f$ by an angle $-\\beta$.\n\nLet $R(\\phi)$ be the counter-clockwise rotation matrix in the Cartesian plane:\n$$ R(\\phi) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\phi  -\\sin\\phi \\\\ \\sin\\phi  \\cos\\phi \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe final vector, when mapped back to the initial tangent space's orientation, is given by:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{final} = R(-\\beta) \\vec{v}_f $$\nSince parallel transport on the flat sector means $\\vec{v}_f = \\vec{v}_i$, we have:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{final} = R(-\\beta) \\vec{v}_i $$\n\nStep 4: Determine the rotation angle.\nThis equation shows that the final vector $\\vec{v}_{final}$ is obtained by rotating the initial vector $\\vec{v}_i$ by an angle of $-\\beta$. Thus, the angle of rotation is $\\Delta\\theta = -\\beta$.\n\nHowever, angles are defined modulo $2\\pi$. A rotation by $-\\beta$ is physically indistinguishable from a rotation by $-\\beta + 2\\pi$. By convention, we often choose the positive angle. The problem states that positive angles are counter-clockwise. A rotation by $-\\beta$ is a clockwise rotation. The equivalent counter-clockwise rotation is $2\\pi - \\beta$.\n\nSo, the net angle of rotation is:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = 2\\pi - \\beta $$\n\nThis result has a profound geometric interpretation. The quantity $\\delta = 2\\pi - \\beta$ is known as the \"deficit angle\" of the cone. It represents the angle of the wedge that was removed from a full disc to create the cone. The net rotation of a parallel-transported vector around a closed loop is a measure of the total curvature enclosed by that loop.
