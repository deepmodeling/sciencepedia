The sum is taken over all possible integer values of the index, which is determined by the dimension of the space.\n\nA fundamental tool in this notation is the Kronecker delta. In a Cartesian coordinate system, its components can be written with either upper or lower indices, and are defined as:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij} = \\delta^{ij} = \\delta^i_j = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } i = j \\\\ 0  \\text{if } i \\neq j \\end{cases}\n$$\nConsider a 3-dimensional Euclidean space, where all indices (such as $i$ and $j$) can take on the integer values 1, 2, or 3.\n\nUsing the Einstein summation convention, calculate the numerical value of the scalar quantity $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$.", "solution": "The quantity we need to compute is $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$. The Einstein summation convention implies that we must sum over both index $i$ and index $j$ because each appears twice in the expression (once as a subscript and once as a superscript, although in this Euclidean context the position does not change the value of the Kronecker delta). Since the space is 3-dimensional, the indices $i$ and $j$ range from 1 to 3.\n\nThe expression $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$ is a concise way of writing the double summation:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij}\n$$\nThe problem statement gives the definition of the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$, which is 1 if $i=j$ and 0 if $i \\neq j$. The same definition applies to $\\delta^{ij}$. Therefore, the product $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$ is non-zero only when the condition $i=j$ is met. If $i \\neq j$, then $\\delta_{ij}=0$, and the term $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$ becomes $0 \\cdot \\delta^{ij} = 0$.\n\nConsequently, we only need to sum the terms for which $i=j$:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=j} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij} = \\delta_{11}\\delta^{11} + \\delta_{22}\\delta^{22} + \\delta_{33}\\delta^{33}\n$$\nAll other terms in the nine-term expansion of the double sum, such as $\\delta_{12}\\delta^{12}$ or $\\delta_{21}\\delta^{21}$, are zero.\n\nAccording to the definition of the Kronecker delta:\n$\\delta_{11} = 1$ and $\\delta^{11} = 1$\n$\\delta_{22} = 1$ and $\\delta^{22} = 1$\n$\\delta_{33} = 1$ and $\\delta^{33} = 1$\n\nSubstituting these values into our sum:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nAlternatively, we can perform the summation one index at a time. Let's first sum over $j$:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij} \\right)\n$$\nConsider the inner sum $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij}$ for a fixed value of $i$. This sum expands to:\n$$\n\\delta_{i1}\\delta^{i1} + \\delta_{i2}\\delta^{i2} + \\delta_{i3}\\delta^{i3}\n$$\nFor a fixed $i$, only one of the terms $\\delta_{i1}, \\delta_{i2}, \\delta_{i3}$ is non-zero. Specifically, $\\delta_{ij}$ is 1 only when $j=i$. So, the sum simplifies to just the term where $j=i$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij} = \\delta_{ii}\\delta^{ii} = (1)(1) = 1\n$$\nThis result holds for any choice of $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Now, we substitute this result back into the outer sum over $i$:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.
