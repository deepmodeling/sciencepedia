The components of this tensor are given in a standard inertial frame with spacetime coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3)$, where $x^0 = ct$.

For a rank-2 tensor $T^{\\alpha\\beta}$, the corresponding covariant tensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}$ is obtained by applying the metric tensor twice. The general formula, using the Einstein summation convention where repeated indices are summed over from 0 to 3, is:\n$$\nT_{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta_{\\mu\\alpha} \\eta_{\\nu\\beta} T^{\\alpha\\beta}\n$$\nIn this formula, the summation is implied over both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.

To do this, we set the free indices $\\mu=1$ and $\\nu=2$:\n$$\nT_{12} = \\eta_{1\\alpha} \\eta_{2\\beta} T^{\\alpha\\beta}\n$$\nLet's first evaluate the sum over the index $\\alpha$:\n$$\nT_{12} = (\\eta_{10} \\eta_{2\\beta} T^{0\\beta}) + (\\eta_{11} \\eta_{2\\beta} T^{1\\beta}) + (\\eta_{12} \\eta_{2\\beta} T^{2\\beta}) + (\\eta_{13} \\eta_{2\\beta} T^{3\\beta})\n$$\nThe Minkowski metric $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ provided is a diagonal matrix. This means that its off-diagonal components are zero. Therefore, $\\eta_{10} = \\eta_{12} = \\eta_{13} = 0$. The only non-zero term in this expansion is the one where the index $\\alpha$ is equal to 1. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nT_{12} = \\eta_{11} \\eta_{2\\beta} T^{1\\beta}\n$$\nNow, we perform the summation over the index $\\beta$:\n$$\nT_{12} = \\eta_{11} (\\eta_{20}T^{10} + \\eta_{21}T^{11} + \\eta_{22}T^{12} + \\eta_{23}T^{13})\n$$\nAgain, since the metric is diagonal, the only non-zero component of $\\eta_{2\\beta}$ is when $\\beta=2$. All other terms, $\\eta_{20}$, $\\eta_{21}$, and $\\eta_{23}$, are zero. This simplifies the expression further:\n$$\nT_{12} = \\eta_{11} \\eta_{22} T^{12}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the values of the metric components from the problem statement. We have $\\eta_{11} = -1$ and $\\eta_{22} = -1$.\n$$\nT_{12} = (-1)(-1) T^{12}\n$$\n$$\nT_{12} = T^{12}\n$$\nThus, the component $T_{12}$ of the covariant tensor is identical to the component $T^{12}$ of the contravariant tensor.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T^{12}}$$", "id": "1844785"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simple component calculations, a deeper understanding comes from exploring how intrinsic tensor properties behave under index manipulation.
