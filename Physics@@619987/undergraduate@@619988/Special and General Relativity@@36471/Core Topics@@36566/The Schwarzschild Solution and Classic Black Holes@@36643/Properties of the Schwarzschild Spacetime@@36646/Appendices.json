In the context of General Relativity, where gravity is the curvature of spacetime, this idea is preserved but requires a more nuanced approach. This exercise challenges you to calculate the escape velocity from a stationary position in the Schwarzschild spacetime, prompting a careful distinction between the locally measured launch speed and the conserved energy that governs the particle's ultimate fate at infinity.", "problem": "A futuristic research platform is engineered to remain stationary with respect to a non-rotating, uncharged supermassive black hole of mass $M$. The platform hovers at a constant radial coordinate $r = r_0$, which is outside the black hole's event horizon. The gravitational field is described by the Schwarzschild metric, for which the spacetime interval $ds$ is given by:\n$$ds^2 = - \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2 r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 (d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2)$$\nwhere $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nFrom this platform, a small, unpowered probe of mass $m$ is launched radially outward, directly away from the black hole.
