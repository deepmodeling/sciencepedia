The provided Painlevé-Gullstrand (PG) coordinates are well-suited for this.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the notion of proper distance in PG coordinates**\nFor a radial path ($d\\theta=d\\phi=0$) at a fixed PG time $T$ ($dT=0$), the line element gives the spatial separation:\n$$ds^2 = dr^2$$\nThis implies that for two nearby observers separated by a coordinate distance $dr$, their proper separation $d\\ell$ is simply $d\\ell = dr$. Thus, for a small separation, the proper distance $\\ell$ is equal to the coordinate separation $\\delta r$. This greatly simplifies the analysis compared to standard Schwarzschild coordinates, where $d\\ell = (1-r_s/r)^{-1/2} dr$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the four-velocity and proper time of the infalling observers**\nThe observers are on radial geodesics, falling from rest at infinity. In PG coordinates, these trajectories are given by observers moving with four-velocity $u^{\\mu} = (u^T, u^r, 0, 0)$ where $u^T = \\frac{dT}{d\\tau} = 1$ and $u^r = \\frac{dr}{d\\tau} = -\\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}$.\nLet's verify this.

The condition $u^T = dT/d\\tau = 1$ implies that for these observers, the PG coordinate time $T$ is identical to their proper time $\\tau$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the proper acceleration of the radial coordinate**\nThe motion is geodesic, so the four-acceleration is zero: $a^\\mu = \\frac{du^\\mu}{d\\tau} + \\Gamma^\\mu_{\\nu\\sigma}u^\\nu u^\\sigma = 0$.\nWe are interested in the radial component, $a^r = 0$:\n$$\\frac{d^2r}{d\\tau^2} + \\Gamma^r_{\\nu\\sigma}u^\\nu u^\\sigma = 0$$\nFor the PG metric, the only non-zero Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^r_{\\nu\\sigma}$ are $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -r$ and $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi} = -r\\sin^2\\theta$. Since the motion is radial, $u^\\theta=u^\\phi=0$. The geodesic equation for the radial component simplifies dramatically:\n$$\\frac{d^2r}{d\\tau^2} + 0 = 0$$\nThis appears too simple. Let's re-examine this. The formula $a^r=0$ applies.\nHowever, $u^r = dr/d\\tau$ is a function of $r$.
