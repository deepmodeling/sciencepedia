In other words, an outgoing null ray emitted at the horizon lies on the horizon generator and never reaches any $r>2M$.\n\nEvent E2 is defined as the emission of an outward null pulse from the stellar surface at the instant it crosses $r=2M$. Therefore, the null ray from E2 lies on the event horizon for its entire future development. Since Alice is stationary at a fixed $r_{A}>2M$, the E2 null ray cannot reach $r_{A}$, so Alice cannot receive E2. Bob, however, begins outside and falls freely inward, crossing $r=2M$ at finite proper time. The event horizon is a null hypersurface generated by outgoing null geodesics; the E2 photon is precisely one such generator. A timelike worldline that crosses the horizon intersects the horizon on exactly one of its generators. By spherical symmetry (single radial direction), Bobâ€™s crossing event lies on the same generator along which the E2 photon propagates. Thus Bobâ€™s worldline $x^{\\mu}(\\tau)$ intersects the E2 null curve $x^{\\mu}_{\\text{E2}}(\\lambda)$ at his horizon-crossing event, so Bob does receive E2 at the moment he crosses the horizon.\n\nNow consider E1, emitted radially outward from the center at time $t_{1}<0$, before the main collapse phase. The event horizon is defined as the boundary of the causal past of future null infinity. There exists a last outgoing null ray that just fails to escape; it asymptotes to the event horizon generator. Any earlier outgoing null ray (with retarded time $u<t_{\\text{last}}-r_{*}$) escapes to $r>2M$ and reaches distant observers. Since E1 is emitted before the main collapse phase, it corresponds to an outgoing null geodesic that escapes the forming black hole region and propagates outward through the stellar material to the exterior. Consequently, both Alice at fixed $r_{A}>2M$ and Bob at $r_{B}>2M$ (before he later crosses the horizon) lie in the future light cone of E1 and thus receive the E1 signal.\n\nCollecting these causal conclusions:\n- E1: reaches both Alice and Bob (both are outside when it arrives).\n- E2: trapped on the horizon; does not reach Alice at $r_{A}>2M$, but is encountered by Bob when he crosses the horizon.\n\nThis matches option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1841992"}]}
