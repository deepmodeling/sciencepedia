While our Newtonian intuition suggests that the object's speed should relentlessly increase as it gets closer, the reality in General Relativity is far more subtle. This exercise challenges you to calculate the object's speed as measured in the distant observer's coordinates ($v_{coord} = dr/dt$) and discover the surprising, counter-intuitive result that this speed peaks and then plummets to zero as the object approaches the event horizon [@problem_id:1844005].

A distant observer, who is stationary with respect to the black hole, records the probe's motion using their own coordinate time, $t$.
