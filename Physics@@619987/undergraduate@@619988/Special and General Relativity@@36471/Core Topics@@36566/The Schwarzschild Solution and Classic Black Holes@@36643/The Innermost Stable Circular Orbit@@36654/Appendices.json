Since $U(r)$ decreases for $r \\neq r_{0}$ in a neighborhood of $r_{0}$ (because $U''(r_{0})0$), an outward perturbation lowers $U$ below $\\tilde E^{2}=1$ and releases positive radial kinetic energy, allowing the particle to escape to infinity with zero asymptotic kinetic energy; an inward perturbation likewise lowers $U$ and the particle plunges inward through the potential barrier toward the horizon. There is no restoring force to produce oscillations, and no spontaneous transition to another stable circular orbit occurs without a change in conserved quantities.\n\nBecause each segment of the ring consists of independent geodesic particles, a random infinitesimal radial perturbation will send some particles inward and others outward, leading to the disintegration of the ring; the ultimate fate depends on the direction of each perturbation.
