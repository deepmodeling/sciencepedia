Consider an axion initially at rest in the laboratory frame.

Let $c$ be the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nA. The decay is possible, but only if the axion is moving at a specific velocity close to $c$; it is forbidden for an axion at rest.\n\nB. The decay is possible. Conservation of momentum requires the final photon to have zero momentum, which implies it also has zero energy. This zero-energy photon is undetectable, explaining why the decay has not been observed.\n\nC. The decay is impossible. While momentum can be conserved if the photon is not emitted, this would violate the conservation of energy, as the initial axion has non-zero rest energy.\n\nD. The decay is impossible. Equating the Lorentz-invariant squared norm of the initial four-momentum (the axion at rest) with that of the final four-momentum (the single photon) leads to a logical contradiction with the fact that the axion is a massive particle.\n\nE. The decay is possible. Energy conservation dictates that the photon's energy must be $E_\\gamma = m_a c^2$. The corresponding momentum conservation is satisfied because the photon carries this momentum away, and the recoil is absorbed by the vacuum.", "solution": "To analyze the proposed decay process $A \\to \\gamma$, where a massive particle $A$ with rest mass $m_a  0$ decays into a single photon $\\gamma$, we will use the principle of conservation of the energy-momentum four-vector (or four-momentum). The four-momentum is a vector in four-dimensional spacetime, defined as $P^\\mu = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, where $E$ is the total energy, $\\vec{p}$ is the three-dimensional momentum vector, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nThe principle of conservation of four-momentum states that the total four-momentum of a closed system is constant. For a decay process, this means the four-momentum of the initial particle must equal the total four-momentum of the decay products.\n$$P^\\mu_{initial} = P^\\mu_{final}$$\n\nLet's first define the four-momentum for the initial and final states in the laboratory frame, which is also the rest frame of the axion since it is initially at rest.\n\n**Initial State:** The axion $A$ is at rest.\nIts total energy is its rest energy, $E_A = m_a c^2$.\nIts three-momentum is $\\vec{p}_A = \\vec{0}$.\nTherefore, the initial four-momentum is:\n$$P^\\mu_{initial} = P^\\mu_A = \\left(\\frac{m_a c^2}{c}, \\vec{0}\\right) = (m_a c, 0, 0, 0)$$\n\n**Final State:** The final state consists of a single photon $\\gamma$.\nA photon is a massless particle. Its energy is related to the magnitude of its three-momentum, $|\\vec{p}_\\gamma|$, by $E_\\gamma = |\\vec{p}_\\gamma| c$.\nThe final four-momentum is:\n$$P^\\mu_{final} = P^\\mu_\\gamma = \\left(\\frac{E_\\gamma}{c}, \\vec{p}_\\gamma\\right)$$\n\nIf the decay is to occur, conservation of four-momentum requires $P^\\mu_A = P^\\mu_\\gamma$. This single vector equation is equivalent to four separate equations for each component:\n1.  Conservation of energy (from the time-like component): $m_a c = \\frac{E_\\gamma}{c} \\implies E_\\gamma = m_a c^2$.\n2.  Conservation of momentum (from the three space-like components): $\\vec{0} = \\vec{p}_\\gamma$.\n\nNow we must check if these two conditions can be simultaneously satisfied.\nThe condition from momentum conservation is that the photon's three-momentum must be zero, $\\vec{p}_\\gamma = \\vec{0}$.\nIf a photon has zero momentum, its energy must also be zero, since $E_\\gamma = |\\vec{p}_\\gamma| c = |\\vec{0}| c = 0$.\nHowever, the condition from energy conservation requires the photon's energy to be $E_\\gamma = m_a c^2$. Since the axion is massive ($m_a  0$) and $c$ is a non-zero constant, $m_a c^2$ must be greater than zero.\nSo we have a contradiction: $E_\\gamma$ must be simultaneously zero and greater than zero. This is impossible.\n\nAn alternative, more elegant way to show this contradiction is to use the Lorentz-invariant squared norm (or magnitude) of the four-momentum, which is defined as $P^\\mu P_\\mu = (E/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2$. This quantity is the same in all inertial reference frames. For a particle with rest mass $m$, its value is $m^2 c^2$.\n\nIf the four-vectors are equal, $P^\\mu_{initial} = P^\\mu_{final}$, then their squared norms must also be equal:\n$$P^\\mu_{initial} P_{\\mu, initial} = P^\\mu_{final} P_{\\mu, final}$$\n\nLet's calculate the squared norm for the initial and final states.\nFor the initial state (axion at rest):\n$$P^\\mu_A P_{\\mu, A} = (m_a c)^2 - |\\vec{0}|^2 = m_a^2 c^2$$\nThis is consistent, as the squared norm is $(m_a)^2 c^2$.\n\nFor the final state (single photon):\nA photon is a massless particle, so its rest mass is $m_\\gamma = 0$. The squared norm of its four-momentum is always zero:\n$$P^\\mu_\\gamma P_{\\mu, \\gamma} = (m_\\gamma)^2 c^2 = 0^2 c^2 = 0$$\n\nNow, we set the initial and final squared norms equal, as required by the conservation of four-momentum:\n$$m_a^2 c^2 = 0$$\nSince $c \\neq 0$, this equation implies that $m_a^2 = 0$, which means $m_a = 0$.\nThis result contradicts the given information that the axion has a non-zero rest mass ($m_a  0$).\nTherefore, the proposed decay violates the conservation of four-momentum and is physically impossible.\n\nThis line of reasoning corresponds directly to option D.\n- Option A is incorrect; the process is forbidden in all frames.\n- Option B is incorrect because a zero-energy photon is not a valid outcome of the decay of a massive particle; it presents a flawed argument.\n- Option C is partially correct in identifying a conflict, but it frames it as a choice between conserving one quantity or the other, whereas the laws of physics demand both are conserved simultaneously. The four-vector formalism shows they cannot be.\n- Option D correctly identifies that the invariant property of the four-momentum leads to a direct contradiction, which is the most precise and fundamental reason the decay is forbidden.\n- Option E is incorrect because it ignores the conservation of momentum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1868804"}, {"introduction": "This final practice applies the conservation of four-momentum to a realistic scenario from experimental particle physics.
