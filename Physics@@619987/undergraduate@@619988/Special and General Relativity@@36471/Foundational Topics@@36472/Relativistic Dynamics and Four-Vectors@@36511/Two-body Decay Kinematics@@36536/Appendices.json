Let the sigmon be the parent particle and the two tau-prime particles be the daughter particles.\n\nThe total four-momentum of a system is conserved in any interaction.

The conservation of four-momentum states that:\n$$P_{sigmon} = p_1 + p_2$$\n\nThe four-momentum $P$ for a particle is given by $(E/c, \\vec{p})$, where $E$ is the relativistic energy and $\\vec{p}$ is the three-momentum.\n\nBefore the decay, the sigmon is stationary. Therefore, its three-momentum is zero, $\\vec{p}_{sigmon} = \\vec{0}$. Its energy is its rest energy, $E_{sigmon} = Mc^2$.
