This principle is vividly demonstrated in particle collisions, where the energy of motion can be transformed into new rest mass. This final practice challenges you to analyze a perfectly inelastic collision, where two particles merge into one, and to calculate how much of the initial kinetic energy is converted into internal energy of the newly formed particle [@problem_id:1848078].", "problem": "In a fixed-target particle physics experiment, a projectile particle with rest mass $m$ is accelerated to a relativistic kinetic energy $K_{coll}$. It then collides with an identical target particle, which is initially at rest in the laboratory frame. The collision is perfectly inelastic, meaning the two particles merge to form a single, new composite particle. During this process, a portion of the initial kinetic energy is converted into the internal energy of the composite particle, which can be modeled as thermal energy, $U$. The rest energy of the composite particle is defined as the sum of the rest energies of the original two particles plus this newly created internal energy $U$.\n\nAssuming the validity of special relativity, derive an expression for the internal thermal energy $U$ generated in the collision. Express your answer in terms of the initial kinetic energy of the projectile, $K_{coll}$, the rest mass of the projectile/target particle, $m$, and the speed of light, $c$.", "solution": "The solution to this problem relies on the conservation of the energy-momentum four-vector. The squared magnitude of the total four-momentum of the system, known as the invariant mass squared, is a Lorentz invariant quantity and is conserved before and after the collision.\n\nLet's first characterize the system before the collision. The system consists of two particles, each with rest mass $m$.\nParticle 1 is the projectile. Its rest energy is $mc^2$. Its total relativistic energy $E_1$ is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy $K_{coll}$:\n$$E_1 = K_{coll} + mc^2$$\nLet the momentum of the projectile be $p_1$. The energy-momentum relation for this particle is $E_1^2 = (p_1 c)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. We can express the momentum in terms of the kinetic energy:\n$$(K_{coll} + mc^2)^2 = (p_1 c)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$\n$$K_{coll}^2 + 2K_{coll}mc^2 + (mc^2)^2 = (p_1 c)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$\n$$(p_1 c)^2 = K_{coll}^2 + 2K_{coll}mc^2$$\n\nParticle 2 is the target, which is at rest. Its kinetic energy is zero.\nIts total energy is its rest energy:\n$$E_2 = mc^2$$\nIts momentum is zero:\n$$p_2 = 0$$\n\nThe total energy of the system before the collision, $E_{i}$, is the sum of the energies of the two particles:\n$$E_{i} = E_1 + E_2 = (K_{coll} + mc^2) + mc^2 = K_{coll} + 2mc^2$$\nThe total momentum of the system before the collision, $\\vec{p}_{i}$, is the vector sum of the individual momenta:\n$$\\vec{p}_{i} = \\vec{p}_1 + \\vec{p}_2 = \\vec{p}_1$$\nThe square of the magnitude of the total momentum is $(p_i c)^2 = (p_1 c)^2 = K_{coll}^2 + 2K_{coll}mc^2$.\n\nNow, let's consider the system after the perfectly inelastic collision. The two particles have merged into a single composite particle of rest mass $M$.\nLet the total energy of this composite particle be $E_{f}$ and its momentum be $\\vec{p}_{f}$.\nBy conservation of energy and momentum:\n$$E_f = E_i = K_{coll} + 2mc^2$$\n$$\\vec{p}_f = \\vec{p}_i$$\nSo, $(p_f c)^2 = (p_i c)^2 = K_{coll}^2 + 2K_{coll}mc^2$.\n\nThe invariant mass of the system is conserved. For a single particle of rest mass $M$, total energy $E_f$, and momentum $p_f$, its rest energy $Mc^2$ is related to $E_f$ and $p_f$ by the energy-momentum relation:\n$$(Mc^2)^2 = E_f^2 - (p_f c)^2$$\nWe can substitute the expressions for $E_f$ and $p_f$ derived from the initial state and conservation laws:\n$$(Mc^2)^2 = (K_{coll} + 2mc^2)^2 - (K_{coll}^2 + 2K_{coll}mc^2)$$\nExpanding the first term on the right-hand side:\n$$(Mc^2)^2 = (K_{coll}^2 + 4K_{coll}mc^2 + 4m^2c^4) - (K_{coll}^2 + 2K_{coll}mc^2)$$\nSimplifying the expression by combining like terms:\n$$(Mc^2)^2 = K_{coll}^2 - K_{coll}^2 + 4K_{coll}mc^2 - 2K_{coll}mc^2 + 4m^2c^4$$\n$$(Mc^2)^2 = 2K_{coll}mc^2 + 4m^2c^4$$\nThe rest energy of the final composite particle, $Mc^2$, is therefore:\n$$Mc^2 = \\sqrt{2K_{coll}mc^2 + 4m^2c^4}$$\n\nThe problem defines the internal thermal energy $U$ as the increase in the system's rest energy. The initial total rest energy of the two separate particles was $m c^2 + m c^2 = 2mc^2$. The final rest energy is $Mc^2$.
