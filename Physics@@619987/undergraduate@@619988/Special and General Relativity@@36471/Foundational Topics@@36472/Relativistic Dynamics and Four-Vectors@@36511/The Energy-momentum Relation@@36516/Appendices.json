The threshold condition corresponds to the minimum energy required for the reaction to be kinematically possible. This occurs when all the particles in the final state are created with zero relative momentum; that is, they all move together with the same final velocity. In the center-of-mass frame, this means the final particles are all created at rest.\n\nWe will solve this problem by using the conservation of the total four-momentum and the Lorentz invariance of the squared magnitude of a four-momentum vector. The four-momentum $P$ is a four-vector defined as $P = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, where $E$ is the total energy and $\\vec{p}$ is the three-momentum. The squared magnitude of a four-momentum vector is $P^2 = P \\cdot P = (E/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = m^2 c^2$, which is a Lorentz invariant quantity.\n\nLet's define the four-momenta in the laboratory frame, where the target proton is at rest.\nLet the incident proton be particle 1 and the target proton be particle 2.\nThe four-momentum of the incident proton is $P_1 = (E_1/c, \\vec{p}_1)$, where $E_1$ is its total energy and $\\vec{p}_1$ is its momentum. The mass of the proton is $m_p$, so $E_1^2 = (p_1c)^2 + (m_p c^2)^2$. The kinetic energy of the incident proton is $K_1 = E_1 - m_p c^2$.\nThe target proton is at rest, so its momentum $\\vec{p}_2 = \\vec{0}$ and its energy is its rest energy, $E_2 = m_p c^2$. Its four-momentum is $P_2 = (m_p c, \\vec{0})$.\n\nThe total four-momentum of the initial state is the sum of the individual four-momenta:\n$$P_{initial} = P_1 + P_2 = (E_1/c + m_p c, \\vec{p}_1)$$\n\nNow consider the final state, which consists of two protons and one eta meson. At the threshold energy, these three particles move together as a single entity. This composite system has a total rest mass equal to the sum of the rest masses of the final particles, $M_{final} = m_p + m_p + m_{\\eta} = 2m_p + m_{\\eta}$.\nLet the four-momentum of this final composite system be $P_{final}$.

Therefore, their squared magnitudes must also be equal:\n$$P_{initial}^2 = P_{final}^2$$\n\nLet's compute the squared magnitude of the initial total four-momentum:\n$$P_{initial}^2 = (P_1 + P_2) \\cdot (P_1 + P_2) = P_1^2 + P_2^2 + 2(P_1 \\cdot P_2)$$\nThe individual squared magnitudes are $P_1^2 = m_p^2 c^2$ and $P_2^2 = m_p^2 c^2$.\nThe dot product $P_1 \\cdot P_2$ is:\n$$P_1 \\cdot P_2 = (E_1/c)(m_p c) - \\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{0} = E_1 m_p$$\nSubstituting these back, we get:\n$$P_{initial}^2 = 2m_p^2 c^2 + 2E_1 m_p$$\n\nNow we equate the squared magnitudes of the initial and final total four-momenta:\n$$2m_p^2 c^2 + 2E_1 m_p = (2m_p + m_{\\eta})^2 c^2$$\nWe need to solve for the total energy $E_1$ of the incident proton at threshold.\n$$2E_1 m_p = ((2m_p + m_{\\eta})^2) c^2 - 2m_p^2 c^2$$\n$$2E_1 m_p = (4m_p^2 + 4m_p m_{\\eta} + m_{\\eta}^2) c^2 - 2m_p^2 c^2$$\n$$2E_1 m_p = (2m_p^2 + 4m_p m_{\\eta} + m_{\\eta}^2) c^2$$\n$$E_1 = \\frac{2m_p^2 + 4m_p m_{\\eta} + m_{\\eta}^2}{2m_p} c^2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the threshold kinetic energy $K_{th}$ of the incident proton, which is related to its total energy $E_1$ by $E_1 = K_{th} + m_p c^2$.\n$$K_{th} + m_p c^2 = \\frac{2m_p^2 + 4m_p m_{\\eta} + m_{\\eta}^2}{2m_p} c^2$$\nNow, we solve for $K_{th}$:\n$$K_{th} = \\left( \\frac{2m_p^2 + 4m_p m_{\\eta} + m_{\\eta}^2}{2m_p} - m_p \\right) c^2$$\nTo simplify the term in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$$K_{th} = \\left( \\frac{2m_p^2 + 4m_p m_{\\eta} + m_{\\eta}^2 - 2m_p^2}{2m_p} \\right) c^2$$\n$$K_{th} = \\left( \\frac{4m_p m_{\\eta} + m_{\\eta}^2}{2m_p} \\right) c^2$$\nWe can factor out $m_{\\eta}$ from the numerator and simplify the expression:\n$$K_{th} = \\left( \\frac{m_{\\eta}(4m_p + m_{\\eta})}{2m_p} \\right) c^2$$\nAlternatively, we can split the fraction:\n$$K_{th} = \\left( \\frac{4m_p m_{\\eta}}{2m_p} + \\frac{m_{\\eta}^2}{2m_p} \\right) c^2$$\n$$K_{th} = \\left( 2m_{\\eta} + \\frac{m_{\\eta}^2}{2m_p} \\right) c^2$$\nThis is the final expression for the threshold kinetic energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(2m_{\\eta} + \\frac{m_{\\eta}^{2}}{2m_{p}}\\right)c^{2}}$$", "id": "1862285"}]}
