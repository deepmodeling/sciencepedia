The geometry of this spacetime is governed by the Minkowski metric $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$ with the signature $(+1, -1, -1, -1)$. In a particular inertial reference frame, a uniform static electromagnetic field exists in the region between two very large, parallel conducting plates. These plates are oriented parallel to the $yz$-plane and carry a uniform surface charge density of $+\\sigma$ and $-\\sigma$, respectively. The permittivity of free space is $\\epsilon_0$. Outside the plates, the electromagnetic field is zero.\n\nDetermine the matrix representation of the contravariant electromagnetic field strength tensor, $F^{\\mu\\nu}$, in the region between the plates.", "solution": "First, we determine the electric and magnetic fields generated by the parallel-plate capacitor. According to Gauss's law for electrostatics, two infinite parallel plates with opposite uniform surface charge densities $+\\sigma$ and $-\\sigma$ create a uniform electric field between them of magnitude $E = \\sigma/\\epsilon_0$, where $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. Outside the plates, the field is zero. The problem states the plates are parallel to the $yz$-plane. This means the electric field is directed along the $x$-axis. We can assume the field points in the positive $x$-direction (from the positive plate to the negative plate). Since the charges are static, there is no magnetic field. Therefore, the field components in the given inertial frame are:\n$\\mathbf{E} = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}, 0, 0\\right)$\n$\\mathbf{B} = (0, 0, 0)$\n\nThe electric and magnetic field components are thus:\n$E_x = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_0}$, $E_y = 0$, $E_z = 0$\n$B_x = 0$, $B_y = 0$, $B_z = 0$\n\nThe electromagnetic field strength tensor is constructed from these fields. We begin with the covariant tensor, $F_{\\mu\\nu}$, whose components in Cartesian coordinates $x^\\mu = (ct, x, y, z)$ are given by the matrix:\n$$\nF_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & E_x/c & E_y/c & E_z/c \\\\ -E_x/c & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\\\ -E_y/c & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\\\ -E_z/c & -B_y & B_x & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSubstituting the components of our specific $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ fields into this matrix, we get:\n$$\nF_{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{\\sigma}{c\\epsilon_0} & 0 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{\\sigma}{c\\epsilon_0} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the contravariant tensor, $F^{\\mu\\nu}$. This is obtained by raising the indices of the covariant tensor using the Minkowski metric, according to the relation $F^{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta^{\\mu\\alpha} \\eta^{\\nu\\beta} F_{\\alpha\\beta}$. The problem specifies the metric signature $(+1, -1, -1, -1)$, so the matrix for the contravariant metric $\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}$ (which is the inverse of $\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}$) is:\n$$\n\\eta^{\\mu\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince the metric is diagonal, the index-raising operation simplifies to $F^{\\mu\\nu} = \\eta^{\\mu\\mu} \\eta^{\\nu\\nu} F_{\\mu\\nu}$ (with no summation implied on the right-hand side). We only need to compute the non-zero components. The only non-zero off-diagonal component of $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ is $F_{01} = \\frac{\\sigma}{c\\epsilon_0}$.\nLet's compute the corresponding component $F^{01}$:\n$$\nF^{01} = \\eta^{00} \\eta^{11} F_{01} = (1)(-1) \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{c\\epsilon_0}\\right) = -\\frac{\\sigma}{c\\epsilon_0}\n$$\nDue to the antisymmetry of the tensor ($F^{\\nu\\mu} = -F^{\\mu\\nu}$), we also have:\n$$\nF^{10} = -F^{01} = \\frac{\\sigma}{c\\epsilon_0}\n$$\nAll other components of $F^{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero, because the corresponding components of $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero.
