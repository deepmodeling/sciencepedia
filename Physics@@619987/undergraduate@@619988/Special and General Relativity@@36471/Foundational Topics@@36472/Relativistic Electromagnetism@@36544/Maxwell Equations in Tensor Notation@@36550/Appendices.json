The problem specifies the following gauge conditions:\n- $A^0 = 0$\n- $A^1 = 0$\n- $A^3 = 0$\n\nThis means the four-potential must be of the form $A^\\mu = (0, 0, A^2(x,y,z,t), 0)$.\nThe corresponding scalar and vector potentials are:\n- $\\phi = cA^0 = 0$\n- $\\vec{A} = (A^1, A^2, A^3) = (0, A^2(x,y,z,t), 0)$\n\nNow, let's check if this form of potential is consistent with the given electromagnetic fields.\n\nFor the electric field:\n$\\vec{E} = -\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi - \\frac{\\partial\\vec{A}}{\\partial t}$.\nSince $\\phi=0$, the first term $-\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi$ is zero.\nThe second term is $\\frac{\\partial\\vec{A}}{\\partial t} = (0, \\frac{\\partial A^2}{\\partial t}, 0)$.\nThe problem states that the fields are static. A simple way to ensure this is to look for a static potential, where all components are time-independent. So, we assume $\\frac{\\partial A^2}{\\partial t} = 0$. With this assumption, $\\vec{E}=0$ is satisfied, which matches the problem description. Thus, $A^2$ must be a function of spatial coordinates only: $A^2=A^2(x,y,z)$.\n\nFor the magnetic field:\nWe need to compute the curl of the vector potential $\\vec{A} = (0, A_y, 0)$, where we have written $A_y$ for $A^2(x,y,z)$.\nThe curl in Cartesian coordinates is given by:\n$$ \\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{A} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\hat{i} & \\hat{j} & \\hat{k} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\\\ 0 & A_y & 0 \\end{vmatrix} $$\nExpanding the determinant:\n$$ \\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{A} = \\hat{i}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(0) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(A_y)\\right) - \\hat{j}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(0) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(0)\\right) + \\hat{k}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(A_y) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(0)\\right) $$\n$$ \\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{A} = -\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial z}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x}\\hat{k} $$\nWe must equate this to the given magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B_0 \\hat{k}$.\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial z}\\hat{i} + \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x}\\hat{k} = 0\\hat{i} + 0\\hat{j} + B_0\\hat{k} $$\nBy comparing the components, we get two partial differential equations:\n1. $-\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial z} = 0 \\implies A_y$ does not depend on $z$.\n2. $\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x} = B_0$\n\nFrom a previous step, we already concluded $A_y$ does not depend on time. The first equation above tells us it does not depend on $z$. Therefore, $A_y$ can only be a function of $x$ and $y$: $A_y(x,y)$.\nThe second equation, $\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x} = B_0$, can be integrated with respect to $x$:\n$$ A_y(x,y) = \\int B_0 \\,dx = B_0 x + f(y) $$\nwhere $f(y)$ is an arbitrary function of $y$ that acts as the \"constant\" of integration.\n\nThe simplest possible solution is to choose $f(y)=0$.
