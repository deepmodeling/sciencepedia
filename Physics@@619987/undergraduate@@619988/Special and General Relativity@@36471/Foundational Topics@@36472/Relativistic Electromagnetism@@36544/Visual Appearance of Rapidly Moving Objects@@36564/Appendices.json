This phenomenon is described by the relativistic Doppler effect for light.\n\nLet $\\lambda_s$ be the wavelength of light in the source's rest frame (the proper wavelength) and $\\lambda_{obs}$ be the wavelength measured by the observer. When the source is moving directly towards the observer with a speed $v$, the observed wavelength is given by the formula for relativistic blueshift:\n$$\n\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_s \\sqrt{\\frac{c-v}{c+v}}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nIt is often more convenient to work with the dimensionless velocity parameter $\\beta = v/c$. Substituting $v = \\beta c$ into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\lambda_{obs} = \\lambda_s \\sqrt{\\frac{c(1-\\beta)}{c(1+\\beta)}} = \\lambda_s \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}}\n$$\n\nWe are given the source wavelength $\\lambda_s = 530$ nm. The observed light is classified as violet if its wavelength $\\lambda_{obs}$ falls within the range $[380 \\text{ nm}, 450 \\text{ nm}]$. We need to find the *minimum* speed $v$ (or minimum $\\beta$) for this to occur.\n\nLet's rearrange the Doppler formula to solve for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_s} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{obs}}{\\lambda_s}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}\n$$\nLet's define the ratio $R = \\lambda_{obs}/\\lambda_s$.\n$$\nR^2 = \\frac{1-\\beta}{1+\\beta}\n$$\n$$\nR^2 (1+\\beta) = 1-\\beta\n$$\n$$\nR^2 + R^2\\beta = 1-\\beta\n$$\n$$\nR^2\\beta + \\beta = 1 - R^2\n$$\n$$\n\\beta (R^2 + 1) = 1 - R^2\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1 - R^2}{1 + R^2} = \\frac{1 - (\\lambda_{obs}/\\lambda_s)^2}{1 + (\\lambda_{obs}/\\lambda_s)^2}\n$$\nNow we must determine which value of $\\lambda_{obs}$ from the violet range will result in the minimum speed $\\beta$.\nThe function $f(R) = \\frac{1-R^2}{1+R^2}$ is a decreasing function for $R > 0$. Since $\\beta$ must be positive, we are interested in the domain where $R < 1$, which is consistent with a blueshift ($\\lambda_{obs} < \\lambda_s$). To minimize $\\beta$, we must maximize the value of the ratio $R = \\lambda_{obs}/\\lambda_s$.\nTo maximize $R$, we must choose the largest possible value for $\\lambda_{obs}$ from its allowed range. The range for violet light is given as $[380 \\text{ nm}, 450 \\text{ nm}]$. The largest possible wavelength is $\\lambda_{obs,max} = 450$ nm.\n\nUsing a larger observed wavelength means a smaller required frequency shift, and thus a smaller speed. If the speed were any lower, the observed wavelength would be greater than 450 nm, and the light would no longer be classified as violet. Therefore, the minimum speed corresponds to the maximum observed wavelength in the target range.\n\nWe use $\\lambda_{obs} = 450$ nm and $\\lambda_s = 530$ nm.\nThe ratio $R$ is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{450 \\text{ nm}}{530 \\text{ nm}} = \\frac{45}{53}\n$$\nNow we can calculate $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1 - (45/53)^2}{1 + (45/53)^2}\n$$\nTo simplify the calculation, we can write:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{\\frac{53^2 - 45^2}{53^2}}{\\frac{53^2 + 45^2}{53^2}} = \\frac{53^2 - 45^2}{53^2 + 45^2}\n$$\nUsing the difference of squares in the numerator, $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$:\n$$\n53^2 - 45^2 = (53 - 45)(53 + 45) = (8)(98) = 784\n$$\nNow for the denominator:\n$$\n53^2 + 45^2 = 2809 + 2025 = 4834\n$$\nSo, the exact value of $\\beta$ is:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{784}{4834}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to three significant figures:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{784}{4834} \\approx 0.162184524...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{v}{c} \\approx 0.162\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.162}$$", "id": "1881479"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic Doppler shift, this practice delves into its dependence on the viewing angle, revealing a richer and more complex visual world at relativistic speeds.
