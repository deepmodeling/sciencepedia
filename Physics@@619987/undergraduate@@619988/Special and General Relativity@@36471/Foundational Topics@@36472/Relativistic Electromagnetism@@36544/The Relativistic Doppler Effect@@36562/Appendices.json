By calculating the recession velocity of a quasar with a high redshift, $z$, you will directly confront the limits of the classical Doppler formula and quantify why a relativistic approach is essential for modern cosmology [@problem_id:1873004].

The redshift, a dimensionless quantity denoted by $z$, is found to be $z = 3.00$. A simplified, non-relativistic model approximates the recession velocity of a distant object as $v_{nr} = cz$, where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum. For objects moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light, this model is inaccurate, and a relativistic treatment is necessary. The correct relationship between the cosmological redshift $z$ and the relativistic recession velocity $v_r$, for a light source moving directly away from an observer, is given by the formula:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v_r/c}{1 - v_r/c}} = 1 + z $$\nCalculate the relative error of the non-relativistic velocity approximation for this quasar.
