Let's set the observer (Earth) at the origin and the AGN far away on the x-axis. The jet moves towards Earth, so its velocity $\\vec{v}$ is in the $-x$ direction. Therefore, we should use $\\beta = -v/c = -0.900$. The detected light makes an angle $\\theta=30.0^\\circ$ with the jet's direction of motion.

Let's use this angle in the standard formula, with the plasma velocity being $\\vec{v}$ along the $+x$ axis (as if it's moving away from us) and then calculate $\\theta'$ in its rest frame. To avoid confusion, let's use the formula directly with clear definitions.\n\nLet's align the jet's velocity $\\vec{v}$ with the $+x$ axis. The observer on Earth is at rest.

It used $\\cos\\theta'=\\frac{\\cos\\theta-\\beta}{1-\\beta\\cos\\theta}$ and got $98.9^\\circ$. This formula is for an observer moving at speed $\\beta$ looking at a stationary source. The problem is a stationary observer (Earth) looking at a moving source (jet). The correct formula is the inverse: $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\cos\\theta'+\\beta}{1+\\beta\\cos\\theta'}$. Solving this for $\\cos\\theta'$ gives $\\cos\\theta' = \\frac{\\cos\\theta - \\beta}{\\beta\\cos\\theta-1}$.

My derivation `$\\beta - \\cos\\theta$` was wrong, it's $\\cos\\theta-\\beta$.\nLet's re-solve $\\cos\\theta = (\\cos\\theta'+\\beta)/(1+\\beta\\cos\\theta')$ for $\\cos\\theta'$ again carefully.\n$\\cos\\theta(1+\\beta\\cos\\theta') = \\cos\\theta'+\\beta$\n$\\cos\\theta + \\beta\\cos\\theta\\cos\\theta' = \\cos\\theta'+\\beta$\n$\\cos\\theta - \\beta = \\cos\\theta' - \\beta\\cos\\theta\\cos\\theta' = \\cos\\theta'(1-\\beta\\cos\\theta)$.\n$\\cos\\theta' = \\frac{\\cos\\theta - \\beta}{1-\\beta\\cos\\theta}$.\nThe original solution used this formula. It is for an observer moving at speed $\\beta$ relative to a stationary source. Let's assume this is the intended formula despite the physical setup being reversed. The physics should be relative.\n$\\cos\\theta'=\\frac{0.866025 - 0.900}{1-0.900 \\times 0.866025}=\\frac{-0.033975}{1-0.779423}=\\frac{-0.033975}{0.220577}\\approx -0.154026$.\n$\\theta'=\\arccos(-0.154026)\\approx 98.86^\\circ$.\nThe original solution's calculation is correct for the formula it chose. Given the inconsistencies in the article, it is best to stick to a single, correct physical interpretation. The problem states \"jet... moving directly towards Earth\". Earth is the observer. The source is moving. Let's use the emission formula: $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\cos\\theta'+\\beta}{1+\\beta\\cos\\theta'}$.\nWith $\\theta=30^\\circ$ and $\\beta=0.9$, we solve for $\\theta'$.\n$\\cos(30) = \\frac{\\cos\\theta'+0.9}{1+0.9\\cos\\theta'}$.\n$0.866(1+0.9\\cos\\theta') = \\cos\\theta'+0.9$.\n$0.866 + 0.7794\\cos\\theta' = \\cos\\theta' + 0.9$.\n$0.7794\\cos\\theta' - \\cos\\theta' = 0.9 - 0.866$.\n$-0.2206\\cos\\theta' = 0.034$.\n$\\cos\\theta' = -0.034 / 0.2206 \\approx -0.154$.\n$\\theta' = \\arccos(-0.154) \\approx 98.9^\\circ$.\nThe numerical result is the same regardless of which frame is considered primed, as long as the transformation is done correctly. The original solution is numerically correct. I will restore it, as it seems the inconsistency was more in my head than in the text for this problem.
