This first exercise provides a direct application of this core principle to a fundamental physical event: the decay of an unstable particle. By analyzing this scenario from two different inertial frames, you will solidify your understanding of how time intervals are treated as invariant in the classical world, establishing a crucial baseline for later comparison with relativistic time dilation [@problem_id:1840328].", "id": "1840328", "problem": "Before the development of special relativity, the description of space and time was based on the principles of Newtonian mechanics. A fundamental assumption in this classical framework is the existence of an absolute, universal time, which flows equally for all observers regardless of their state of motion.\n\nConsider a hypothetical universe that strictly adheres to the principles of Newtonian physics. In a laboratory reference frame, S, a newly created unstable particle travels at a constant non-zero velocity $\\vec{v}$. An observer in frame S measures the particle's creation at time $t_1 = 0$ and its decay at a later time $t_2 = T_{lab}$.\n\nNow, consider a second reference frame, S', which is co-moving with the particle. For an observer in frame S', the particle remains at rest.\n\nAssuming the validity of Newtonian mechanics and its concept of absolute time, determine the lifetime of the particle as measured by the observer in the co-moving frame S'.

The general form for time is $t' = t + \\tau$, where $\\tau$ is a constant offset depending on the synchronization of clocks between frames.

This practice problem challenges you to separate the concept of an absolute time interval between two events from the measured time interval between the *detection* of those events. Solving this will illuminate how classical kinematics accounts for signal propagation delays, a crucial skill for analyzing astronomical observations even within a pre-relativistic model [@problem_id:1840347].", "id": "1840347", "problem": "A deep-space probe travels at a constant velocity $\\vec{v}$ of magnitude $v$ directly away from a distant quasar.

Let the quasar be at $x=0$ and emit bursts at times $t=0$ and $t=\\tau$. Let the probe move directly away along the $+x$ axis with constant speed $v$, so its position is $x_{p}(t)=x_{0}+v t$, where $x_{0}>0$ is its position at $t=0$.

This final exercise places you in the role of a 19th-century physicist confronted with experimental evidence—a moving clock running slow—that appears to shatter the axiom of absolute time. Your task is not to invoke relativity, but to reason from *within* the Newtonian framework to find a logical explanation for the anomaly. This thought experiment develops critical thinking about how scientific theories are defended and helps illustrate the historical context that necessitated the paradigm shift to Einstein's theories of relativity [@problem_id:1840342].", "id": "1840342", "problem": "Imagine a physicist in the late 19th century who is a firm believer in the principles of Newtonian mechanics, including the concept of absolute, universal time. This physicist is presented with a thought experiment based on future technology: two perfectly constructed and synchronized atomic clocks, Clock A and Clock B.\n\nClock A remains stationary in a laboratory. Clock B is placed on a vehicle that undergoes a round-trip journey at an extremely high, constant velocity, eventually returning to rest alongside Clock A in the laboratory. The experimental result, confirmed with unquestionable precision, is that the total elapsed time measured by the traveling Clock B is less than the total elapsed time measured by the stationary Clock A.\n\nThe physicist has completely ruled out any manufacturing defects or random malfunctions. Given their unshakeable commitment to the Newtonian framework, which of the following conclusions represents the most logical explanation they could formulate to account for this observation without abandoning their core belief in absolute time?\n\nA. The passage of time is relative and is intrinsically dependent on the state of motion of the observer.\nB. The physical mechanism of Clock B must have been altered or impeded by its motion, causing it to run slower as a physical effect, much like how friction might wear down a mechanical part.\nC. It is impossible to definitively determine the simultaneity of the start and end times for the two clocks, leading to an apparent but not a real time difference.\nD. Any physical object moving at high velocities experiences a contraction in length along its direction of motion, which in turn affects its temporal measurement capabilities.\nE. The energy of Clock B increased due to its kinetic energy, and according to the (yet unknown) mass-energy equivalence, this increased mass caused its internal processes to slow down.\n\n", "solution": "We begin from the Newtonian postulate of absolute time: in Newtonian mechanics, time is a universal parameter, the same for all observers regardless of their motion. Therefore, any observation that two clocks disagree on elapsed time must be explained, within this framework, not by time itself being different, but by differences in how the clocks track that absolute time.\n\nGiven the experiment: Clock A remains at rest in the lab, Clock B undertakes a high-speed round trip and returns for a direct, co-located comparison, with both start and end events occurring side by side. The measured result is that Clock B shows less elapsed time than Clock A. The experimental setup rules out random malfunction or manufacturing defect, so any explanation must be systematic and rooted in physical effects correlated with motion.\n\nEvaluate each option against the Newtonian commitment to absolute time:\n\n1) Option A states that time is relative and depends on the observer’s state of motion. This directly contradicts the Newtonian axiom of absolute, universal time, so it is not permissible within the stated commitment.\n\n2) Option B proposes that Clock B’s mechanism was physically affected by its motion (for example, due to stresses, inertial forces, or interaction with a medium such as an ether), causing it to run slow as a physical effect. This preserves absolute time by treating the clock as an imperfect measuring instrument whose rate can be systematically altered by motion, acceleration, or other dynamical influences. This matches the Newtonian stance: time itself remains absolute, but the device’s performance can be velocity-dependent.\n\n3) Option C claims that simultaneity cannot be definitively determined. In Newtonian mechanics, simultaneity is absolute and well-defined. Moreover, the experiment compares the clocks when co-located at both the start and the end, so simultaneity of those events is not in question. Thus, this cannot explain the observed difference within a Newtonian framework.\n\n4) Option D asserts universal length contraction for fast-moving objects affecting temporal measurement. While late 19th-century hypotheses such as Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction were contemplated to explain interferometry, introducing a universal length contraction as a principle is not part of Newtonian mechanics. Even if one invoked contraction as a dynamical effect, the minimal Newtonian-compatible explanation for a timekeeping discrepancy is precisely that the clock’s mechanism is altered by motion, which reduces to Option B without adding a non-Newtonian universal contraction postulate.\n\n5) Option E invokes mass-energy equivalence and increased mass due to kinetic energy to slow internal processes. This is an anachronistic relativistic concept absent in Newtonian theory. Newtonian mechanics keeps mass invariant and has no mass-energy equivalence, so this cannot be adopted without abandoning Newtonian foundations.\n\nTherefore, the only explanation that preserves absolute time and absolute simultaneity while remaining consistent with the reported, repeatable discrepancy is that the moving clock’s mechanism was systematically affected by its motion and thus ran slow relative to absolute time. This is precisely Option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$"}]}
