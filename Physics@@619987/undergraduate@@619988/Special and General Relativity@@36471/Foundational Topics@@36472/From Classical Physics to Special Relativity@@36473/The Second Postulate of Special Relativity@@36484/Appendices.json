This exercise [@problem_id:1875578] challenges you to set aside classical intuition about relative speeds and apply the core principle of an invariant speed of light. By analyzing the speed of photons from the perspective of a fast-moving observer, you will directly confront one of the most profound and counter-intuitive tenets of modern physics.", "problem": "In a hypothetical test of a next-generation medical imaging device, a positron-electron annihilation event is created at the origin of a laboratory coordinate system. The positron and electron are both essentially at rest in the lab frame before they annihilate, producing two gamma-ray photons. These two photons travel away from the origin in opposite directions along the x-axis. A specialized probe, designed to analyze the properties of these photons, travels at a constant velocity of $v = 0.99c$ along the positive x-axis, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. The probe's internal detectors measure the speed of each of the two photons.\n\nWhat speed do the probe's detectors measure for each of the two annihilation photons?\n\nA. $0.01c$ for the photon moving in the same direction as the probe, and $1.99c$ for the photon moving in the opposite direction.\n\nB. $c$ for the photon moving in the same direction as the probe, and $0.01c$ for the photon moving in the opposite direction.\n\nC.

The probe moves with constant velocity $v$ along the $+x$ direction and we seek the photon speeds measured in the probe’s rest frame.\n\nSpecial relativity states that the speed of light in vacuum is invariant in all inertial frames (Einstein’s second postulate). This result can be shown explicitly using the Lorentz transformation and the relativistic velocity addition law.\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for coordinates along the x-axis is\n$$\nx'=\\gamma\\left(x-vt\\right),\\qquad t'=\\gamma\\left(t-\\frac{v x}{c^{2}}\\right),\n$$\nwith $\\gamma=1/\\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}$.
