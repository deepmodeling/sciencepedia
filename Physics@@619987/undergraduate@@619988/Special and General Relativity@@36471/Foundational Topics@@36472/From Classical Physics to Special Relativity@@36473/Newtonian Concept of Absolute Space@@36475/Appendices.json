Its position as a function of time $t$, measured in the laboratory frame (frame S), is given by $x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t)$, where $A$ is the amplitude and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\nThe entire instrument is placed on a platform that moves with a constant velocity $v$ in the positive x-direction relative to the laboratory. An observer is also on this platform, moving with it. This moving reference frame is called frame S'. The origins of frames S and S' coincide at $t=0$.\n\nAssuming the validity of Galilean transformations and that the condition $v < A\\omega$ is met, determine the first time $t > 0$ at which the component appears to be momentarily at rest from the perspective of the observer in frame S'. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $A$, $\\omega$, and $v$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the first time $t>0$ when the oscillating component appears stationary to an observer in a moving reference frame S'. An object is stationary in a reference frame if its velocity in that frame is zero.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between the velocities in the laboratory frame (S) and the moving frame (S') using Galilean relativity. Let $x(t)$ be the position of the component in frame S and $x'(t')$ be its position in frame S'. The Galilean transformation for position, given that frame S' moves with velocity $v$ along the x-axis and their origins coincide at $t=t'=0$, is:\n$$x'(t') = x(t) - vt$$\nIn Galilean relativity, time is absolute, so $t' = t$. Therefore:\n$$x'(t) = x(t) - vt$$\n\nTo find the velocity of the component in frame S', which we'll call $v'(t)$, we differentiate $x'(t)$ with respect to time $t$:\n$$v'(t) = \\frac{dx'(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(x(t) - vt) = \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} - v$$\nLet $v_x(t) = \\frac{dx(t)}{dt}$ be the velocity of the component in the laboratory frame S. The relationship between velocities is:\n$$v'(t) = v_x(t) - v$$\nThe component appears momentarily at rest in frame S' when $v'(t) = 0$. This condition implies:\n$$v_x(t) - v = 0 \\implies v_x(t) = v$$\nSo, we need to find the time $t$ at which the component's velocity in the laboratory frame is equal to the velocity of the moving platform.\n\nNext, we calculate the component's velocity in the laboratory frame, $v_x(t)$. The position is given as $x(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t)$. Differentiating with respect to time gives the velocity:\n$$v_x(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(A \\cos(\\omega t)) = -A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n\nNow we set this equal to $v$ to find the times when the component is at rest in S':\n$$-A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t) = v$$\n$$\\sin(\\omega t) = -\\frac{v}{A\\omega}$$\nThe problem states that $v < A\\omega$, which ensures that $|-\\frac{v}{A\\omega}| < 1$, so real solutions for $t$ exist.\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive value of $t$ that satisfies this equation. The sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants of the unit circle. Let $\\theta = \\omega t$. We are looking for solutions to $\\sin(\\theta) = -C$, where $C = \\frac{v}{A\\omega}$ is a positive constant between 0 and 1.\n\nThe principal value for the arcsin function, $\\arcsin(-C)$, yields an angle in the range $[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0]$. The general solutions for $\\theta$ are given by:\n1. $\\theta = 2n\\pi + \\arcsin(-C) = 2n\\pi - \\arcsin(C)$\n2. $\\theta = (2n+1)\\pi - \\arcsin(-C) = (2n+1)\\pi + \\arcsin(C)$\nwhere $n$ is any integer.\n\nLet's find the smallest positive solution for $\\theta = \\omega t$. Let $\\alpha = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{v}{A\\omega}\\right)$. By the condition $0 < v < A\\omega$, we know that $0 < \\alpha < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nFrom the first family of solutions, $\\theta = 2n\\pi - \\alpha$:\n- If $n=0$, $\\theta = -\\alpha$. This is negative.\n- If $n=1$, $\\theta = 2\\pi - \\alpha$. This is a positive value.\n\nFrom the second family of solutions, $\\theta = (2n+1)\\pi + \\alpha$:\n- If $n=-1$, $\\theta = -\\pi + \\alpha$. This is negative since $\\alpha < \\pi/2$.\n- If $n=0$, $\\theta = \\pi + \\alpha$. This is a positive value.\n\nWe now have two positive candidates for the smallest solution for $\\theta$: $\\pi + \\alpha$ and $2\\pi - \\alpha$. We need to compare them.\nWe compare $\\pi + \\alpha$ with $2\\pi - \\alpha$.\nSubtracting $\\pi$ from both sides gives $\\alpha$ vs $\\pi - \\alpha$.\nAdding $\\alpha$ to both sides gives $2\\alpha$ vs $\\pi$.\nSince $0 < \\alpha < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $0 < 2\\alpha < \\pi$.\nThus, $2\\alpha < \\pi$, which implies $\\alpha < \\pi - \\alpha$, and therefore $\\pi + \\alpha < 2\\pi - \\alpha$.\n\nThe smallest positive value for $\\theta = \\omega t$ is $\\pi + \\alpha$.\n$$\\omega t = \\pi + \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{v}{A\\omega}\\right)$$\nFinally, solving for $t$, we get the first positive time:\n$$t = \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\left(\\pi + \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{v}{A\\omega}\\right)\\right)$$\nThis is the desired symbolic expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\omega} \\left(\\pi + \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{v}{A \\omega}\\right)\\right)}$$", "id": "1840069"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the rules of relative motion, we now turn to a more profound question: can an observer in a sealed laboratory detect their own uniform motion through a hypothetical absolute space?
