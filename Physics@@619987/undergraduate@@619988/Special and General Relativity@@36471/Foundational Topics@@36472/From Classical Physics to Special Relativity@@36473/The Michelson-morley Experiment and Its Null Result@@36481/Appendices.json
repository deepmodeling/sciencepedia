The Michelson-Morley experiment was designed to detect the motion of the Earth through this aether. According to the classical (pre-relativistic) model, this motion would create a \"wind\" that affects the speed of light differently along the two perpendicular arms of a Michelson interferometer. Rotating the apparatus by 90 degrees should then produce a measurable shift in the interference pattern, known as a fringe shift. The predicted magnitude of this shift depends on the apparatus's parameters.\n\nConsider two hypothetical experiments designed to test this aether theory.\n\n**Experiment Prime:** An interferometer with an arm length of $L_P$ is used. The apparatus is assumed to be moving at a speed $v_P$ relative to the stationary aether. The light source used in the experiment has a wavelength of $\\lambda_P$. According to classical predictions, a 90-degree rotation of this setup would result in a fringe shift of $\\Delta N_P$.\n\n**Experiment Secondary:** A different research group builds a second interferometer. This new apparatus has an arm length $L_S$, moves through the aether at a speed $v_S$, and utilizes a light source with a wavelength $\\lambda_S$.

An interferometer has two arms of equal proper length $L_0$, set at right angles to each other. The entire apparatus moves with a velocity $v$ through the stationary ether. The setup is oriented so that one arm is parallel to the velocity $v$ and the other is perpendicular. The speed of light with respect to the ether is a constant, $c$.\n\nA modified theory of length contraction is proposed. According to this theory, the length of an object moving through the ether contracts only in the direction of motion. However, the magnitude of this contraction is exactly 50% of the value required by the Lorentz-FitzGerald hypothesis to explain the null result of the experiment. The arm perpendicular to the motion does not experience any contraction.\n\nBased on this modified theory, determine the expression for the time difference, $\\Delta t = t_{\\parallel} - t_{\\perp}$, where $t_{\\parallel}$ is the round-trip time for light in the arm parallel to the motion and $t_{\\perp}$ is the round-trip time for light in the arm perpendicular to the motion. Your final answer should be a single closed-form expression in terms of $L_0$, $v$, and $c$.", "solution": "Let's analyze the time of flight for light along each arm of the interferometer based on the given hypothetical scenario. We will define the Lorentz factor as $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ for notational convenience.\n\nFirst, consider the arm perpendicular to the direction of motion. The length of this arm is $L_{\\perp} = L_0$, as it does not contract. As the light travels from the beam splitter to the mirror and back, the interferometer itself moves a distance. From the ether's frame of reference, the light must travel along the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle to an upward-moving mirror and back. The speed of light relative to the ether is $c$. The velocity of light in the lab frame has a component perpendicular to the motion, $u_y$, and a component parallel to the motion, $v$. The resultant speed must be $c$. Thus, $u_y^2 + v^2 = c^2$, which gives $u_y = \\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}$.\n\nThe total round-trip time for the perpendicular arm is the total distance traveled ($2L_0$) divided by this effective speed:\n$$t_{\\perp} = \\frac{2 L_0}{\\sqrt{c^2 - v^2}} = \\frac{2 L_0}{c\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \\frac{2 L_0 \\gamma}{c}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the arm parallel to the direction of motion. We must first determine its contracted length, $L_{\\parallel}$. The standard Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction needed to produce a null result would reduce the length from $L_0$ to $L_{LC} = L_0/\\gamma$. The magnitude of this full contraction is $\\Delta L_{full} = L_0 - L_0/\\gamma = L_0(1-1/\\gamma)$.\n\nThe problem states that the contraction is 50% of this amount. So, the actual contraction is:\n$$\\Delta L_{actual} = 0.5 \\times \\Delta L_{full} = \\frac{1}{2} L_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\right)$$\nThe new length of the parallel arm is therefore:\n$$L_{\\parallel} = L_0 - \\Delta L_{actual} = L_0 - \\frac{1}{2} L_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\right) = L_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2\\gamma}\\right) = \\frac{L_0}{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we calculate the round-trip time $t_{\\parallel}$.
