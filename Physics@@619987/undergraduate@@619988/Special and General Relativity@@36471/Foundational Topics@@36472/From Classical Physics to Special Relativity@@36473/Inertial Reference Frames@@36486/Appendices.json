The origin can be considered the boat's starting position.\n\nThe problem requires the velocity of the ASV relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{bg}$, to be directed purely North. This means its x-component must be zero. We can write this vector as:\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{bg} = v_{bg} \\hat{j}\n$$\nwhere $v_{bg}$ is the magnitude we need to find, and $\\hat{j}$ is the unit vector in the North (positive y) direction.\n\nThe velocity of the ASV relative to the ground is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the water, $\\vec{v}_{bw}$, and the velocity of the water relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{wg}$.\n$$\n\\vec{v}_{bg} = \\vec{v}_{bw} + \\vec{v}_{wg}\n$$\n\nLet's decompose the given velocities into their x and y components.\n\nFirst, consider the velocity of the water relative to the ground, $\\vec{v}_{wg}$. Its magnitude is given as $v_{water} = 1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}$. The direction is $25.0^{\\circ}$ east of south. In our coordinate system, South is the negative y-direction. An angle $25.0^{\\circ}$ east of south corresponds to an angle of $-90^\\circ - 25.0^\\circ = -115.0^\\circ$ or $245.0^\\circ$ measured counter-clockwise from the positive x-axis (East).\nThe components are:\n$$\nv_{wg,x} = v_{water} \\cos(-115.0^\\circ) = (1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\cos(-115.0^\\circ)\n$$\n$$\nv_{wg,y} = v_{water} \\sin(-115.0^\\circ) = (1.80 \\, \\text{m/s}) \\sin(-115.0^\\circ)\n$$\nAlternatively, and perhaps more intuitively, the angle with the negative y-axis is $25.0^\\circ$. So, the x-component is positive (East) and the y-component is negative (South).\n$$\nv_{wg,x} = v_{water} \\sin(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\n$$\nv_{wg,y} = -v_{water} \\cos(25.0^\\circ)\n$$\n\nNext, consider the velocity of the ASV relative to the water, $\\vec{v}_{bw}$. Its magnitude is given as $v_{boat} = 4.50 \\, \\text{m/s}$. To counteract the current's eastward drift and move purely north, the boat must steer somewhat to the west. Let $\\theta$ be the angle the boat's heading makes with the North (positive y-axis), measured towards the West.
