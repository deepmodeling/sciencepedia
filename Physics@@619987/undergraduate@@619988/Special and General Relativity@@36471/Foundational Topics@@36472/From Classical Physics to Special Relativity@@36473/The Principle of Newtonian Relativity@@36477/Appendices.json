Assuming non-relativistic speeds, determine the angle $\\theta$ between the final velocity vectors $\\vec{v}'_1$ and $\\vec{v}'_2$. Express your answer in radians.", "solution": "The problem asks for the angle between the final velocities of two particles of equal mass after an oblique elastic collision, where one particle is initially at rest. We can solve this elegantly by transforming to the Center-of-Mass (COM) reference frame, analyzing the collision, and then transforming back to the original Laboratory (Lab) frame.\n\nFirst, we establish the velocities in the Lab frame.\nLet the primary particle be particle 1 and the target particle be particle 2.\nInitial velocity of particle 1: $\\vec{v}_1 = v_0 \\hat{x}$.\nInitial velocity of particle 2: $\\vec{v}_2 = \\vec{0}$.\nThe masses are equal, $m_1 = m_2 = m$.\n\nThe velocity of the center of mass, $\\vec{V}_{CM}$, is constant before and after the collision. We calculate it using the initial state:\n$$\n\\vec{V}_{CM} = \\frac{m_1\\vec{v}_1 + m_2\\vec{v}_2}{m_1 + m_2} = \\frac{m\\vec{v}_1 + m(\\vec{0})}{m + m} = \\frac{m\\vec{v}_1}{2m} = \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1\n$$\n\nNext, we find the initial velocities of the particles in the COM frame, denoted by $\\vec{u}$. The transformation is $\\vec{u} = \\vec{v} - \\vec{V}_{CM}$.\nInitial velocity of particle 1 in COM frame:\n$$\n\\vec{u}_1 = \\vec{v}_1 - \\vec{V}_{CM} = \\vec{v}_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1\n$$\nInitial velocity of particle 2 in COM frame:\n$$\n\\vec{u}_2 = \\vec{v}_2 - \\vec{V}_{CM} = \\vec{0} - \\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1 = -\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1\n$$\nAs expected, in the COM frame, the particles approach each other with equal and opposite momenta: $m\\vec{u}_1 + m\\vec{u}_2 = m(\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1) + m(-\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1) = \\vec{0}$.\n\nNow, we analyze the collision in the COM frame. Let the final velocities in the COM frame be $\\vec{u}'_1$ and $\\vec{u}'_2$. By conservation of momentum in the COM frame, the total momentum must remain zero.\n$$\nm\\vec{u}'_1 + m\\vec{u}'_2 = \\vec{0} \\implies \\vec{u}'_1 = -\\vec{u}'_2\n$$\nThis means that the particles recede from the collision point in opposite directions.\n\nFor an elastic collision, kinetic energy is conserved in any inertial frame. In the COM frame, the conservation of kinetic energy is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}m u_1^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m u_2^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m (u'_1)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m (u'_2)^2\n$$\nSubstituting $u_1 = |\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1| = \\frac{v_0}{2}$ and $u_2 = |-\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1| = \\frac{v_0}{2}$, and using the fact that $u'_1 = u'_2$ (from $\\vec{u}'_1 = -\\vec{u}'_2$), the energy equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\frac{v_0}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m \\left(\\frac{v_0}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m (u'_1)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m (u'_1)^2\n$$\n$$\nm \\left(\\frac{v_0}{2}\\right)^2 = m (u'_1)^2\n$$\nThis gives $u'_1 = \\frac{v_0}{2}$. So, $u'_1 = u_1$ and $u'_2 = u_2$. In an elastic collision between equal masses in the COM frame, the speeds of the particles do not change; only their direction of motion is altered.\nSo, the final velocities in the COM frame are $\\vec{u}'_1$ and $\\vec{u}'_2 = -\\vec{u}'_1$, with magnitude $|\\vec{u}'_1| = \\frac{v_0}{2}$.\n\nFinally, we transform the final velocities back to the Lab frame, denoted by $\\vec{v}'$. The transformation is $\\vec{v}' = \\vec{u}' + \\vec{V}_{CM}$.\nFinal velocity of particle 1 in Lab frame:\n$$\n\\vec{v}'_1 = \\vec{u}'_1 + \\vec{V}_{CM}\n$$\nFinal velocity of particle 2 in Lab frame:\n$$\n\\vec{v}'_2 = \\vec{u}'_2 + \\vec{V}_{CM} = -\\vec{u}'_1 + \\vec{V}_{CM}\n$$\nTo find the angle $\\theta$ between $\\vec{v}'_1$ and $\\vec{v}'_2$, we compute their dot product:\n$$\n\\vec{v}'_1 \\cdot \\vec{v}'_2 = (\\vec{u}'_1 + \\vec{V}_{CM}) \\cdot (-\\vec{u}'_1 + \\vec{V}_{CM})\n$$\nThis is of the form $(A+B)\\cdot(-A+B)$ which expands to $-\\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{A} + \\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B} - \\vec{B}\\cdot\\vec{A} + \\vec{B}\\cdot\\vec{B} = |\\vec{B}|^2 - |\\vec{A}|^2$.\n$$\n\\vec{v}'_1 \\cdot \\vec{v}'_2 = |\\vec{V}_{CM}|^2 - |\\vec{u}'_1|^2\n$$\nWe know the magnitudes of these vectors:\n$|\\vec{V}_{CM}| = |\\frac{1}{2}\\vec{v}_1| = \\frac{v_0}{2}$\n$|\\vec{u}'_1| = \\frac{v_0}{2}$\nSubstituting these values into the dot product equation:\n$$\n\\vec{v}'_1 \\cdot \\vec{v}'_2 = \\left(\\frac{v_0}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{v_0}{2}\\right)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe dot product of the final velocities is zero. The definition of the dot product is $\\vec{v}'_1 \\cdot \\vec{v}'_2 = |\\vec{v}'_1| |\\vec{v}'_2| \\cos\\theta$.\nThe problem states that the final velocities are non-zero, so $|\\vec{v}'_1| \\neq 0$ and $|\\vec{v}'_2| \\neq 0$.
