{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The bedrock of special relativity is the constant speed of light, a principle with profound and often counter-intuitive consequences. This first exercise invites you to explore one of the most direct and visual implications through a scenario reminiscent of Einstein's famous 'light clock' thought experiment. By calculating the path of a light pulse from the perspective of a stationary observer, you will see firsthand why our everyday notions of space and time must be revised and how the constancy of $c$ forces a re-evaluation of how velocities combine [@problem_id:1857351].", "problem": "An experimental high-speed maglev train is undergoing testing on a straight track. To monitor the structural integrity of the passenger cars under high-velocity conditions, an optical diagnostic system is installed. The system consists of a laser emitter on the floor of a car that fires a pulse of light directly upwards to a small mirror on the ceiling, a height $h$ above the emitter. The train travels at a constant velocity $v = 0.8c$ relative to a stationary observer on the ground, where $c$ is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nFrom the perspective of a stationary observer on the ground, the light pulse does not travel vertically. Instead, it follows a diagonal path to the mirror. Determine the angle of the light pulse's path with respect to the direction of the train's motion (i.e., the horizontal floor).\n\nExpress your answer in degrees, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the ground frame be $S$ and the train frame be $S'$. In $S'$, the light travels vertically upward from emitter to mirror with speed $c$, separated by height $h$. In $S$, the train (and thus the mirror) moves horizontally at speed $v$. For the light pulse to meet the moving mirror in $S$, their horizontal positions must match at the reflection event. If the photon's horizontal velocity component in $S$ is $u_{x}$ and the mirror's horizontal speed is $v$, equality of their $x$-coordinates at the meeting time requires\n$$\nu_{x}=v.\n$$\nBy invariance of the speed of light, the magnitude of the photon’s velocity in $S$ is $c$, so its components satisfy\n$$\nu_{x}^{2}+u_{y}^{2}=c^{2}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nu_{y}=\\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}.\n$$\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle of the light’s path above the horizontal (the direction of the train’s motion).

This problem asks you to calculate the apparent length of a moving convoy, which consists of multiple components. The key skill here is to correctly identify the total 'proper length'—the length measured in the system's own rest frame—before applying the Lorentz contraction, reinforcing the idea that objects appear shorter only in their direction of motion to a moving observer [@problem_id:1857381].", "problem": "Two identical cargo shuttles are part of a long convoy traveling through deep space.
