This practice invites you to explore the simple, intuitive consequences of this idea using the principles of Galilean relativity. By calculating the speed of light as measured by a moving observer, you will uncover a key prediction of the aether model that was famously challenged by subsequent experimental evidence [@problem_id:1867521].", "problem": "Before the advent of special relativity, a prominent physical theory proposed the existence of a stationary, all-pervading medium called the luminiferous aether. In this model, light was considered a wave that propagates through this fixed aether at a constant speed, denoted by $c$, relative to the aether itself.\n\nConsider a spaceship traveling at a constant velocity of magnitude $v$ (where $v < c$) with respect to the stationary aether. An observer aboard the spaceship conducts an experiment by sending out two light pulses from the ship. One pulse is emitted in the direction of the spaceship's motion (the \"forward\" pulse), and the other is emitted in the direction opposite to the ship's motion (the \"backward\" pulse).\n\nAssuming the validity of the luminiferous aether hypothesis and Galilean principles of relative motion, determine the speed of the forward pulse and the speed of the backward pulse as measured by the observer on the spaceship. Present your answer as a pair of symbolic expressions for the speeds $(v_{\\text{forward}}, v_{\\text{backward}})$.", "solution": "Let's establish two inertial reference frames. Let frame $S$ be the rest frame of the luminiferous aether. Let frame $S'$ be the reference frame of the spaceship, which is moving with a velocity $\\vec{v}$ relative to the aether. Without loss of generality, let's align the x-axis with the direction of the spaceship's motion, so $\\vec{v} = v\\hat{x}$.\n\nThe problem is based on the aether hypothesis, which predates special relativity. Therefore, we must use the Galilean transformation for velocities, not the Lorentz transformation. The Galilean velocity addition rule states that if an object has velocity $\\vec{u}$ as measured in frame $S$, its velocity $\\vec{u}'$ as measured in frame $S'$ is given by:\n$$ \\vec{u}' = \\vec{u} - \\vec{v} $$\n\nFirst, let's consider the forward-moving light pulse. According to the aether hypothesis, light travels at speed $c$ relative to the aether (frame $S$). The forward pulse travels in the same direction as the spaceship. So, its velocity in the aether frame $S$ is $\\vec{u}_{\\text{forward}} = c\\hat{x}$.\nTo find the velocity of this forward pulse as measured by the observer on the spaceship (frame $S'$), we apply the Galilean transformation:\n$$ \\vec{u}'_{\\text{forward}} = \\vec{u}_{\\text{forward}} - \\vec{v} = c\\hat{x} - v\\hat{x} = (c - v)\\hat{x} $$\nThe speed is the magnitude of this velocity vector. Since $v < c$, the quantity $(c-v)$ is positive. Therefore, the speed of the forward pulse as measured on the spaceship is:\n$$ v_{\\text{forward}} = |\\vec{u}'_{\\text{forward}}| = c - v $$\n\nNext, let's consider the backward-moving light pulse. This pulse travels in the direction opposite to the spaceship's motion. In the aether frame $S$, its velocity is $\\vec{u}_{\\text{backward}} = -c\\hat{x}$.\nAgain, we apply the Galilean transformation to find the velocity as measured by the observer on the spaceship (frame $S'$):\n$$ \\vec{u}'_{\\text{backward}} = \\vec{u}_{\\text{backward}} - \\vec{v} = -c\\hat{x} - v\\hat{x} = -(c + v)\\hat{x} $$\nThe speed is the magnitude of this velocity vector.\n$$ v_{\\text{backward}} = |\\vec{u}'_{\\text{backward}}| = |-(c + v)| = c + v $$\n\nThus, according to the aether hypothesis, the observer on the spaceship would measure the speed of the forward pulse to be $c-v$ and the speed of the backward pulse to be $c+v$. This result famously contradicts the second postulate of special relativity, which states that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.\n\nThe ordered pair of speeds $(v_{\\text{forward}}, v_{\\text{backward}})$ is $(c-v, c+v)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} c - v & c + v \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1867521"}, {"introduction": "The prediction that the measured speed of light depends on an observer's motion has profound consequences for measuring elapsed time.
