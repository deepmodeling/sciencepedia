This practice provides a direct application of the Lorentz transformations to a tangible scenario, forcing us to confront how different inertial observers measure the time between the same two events.

At time $t=0$, a point-like source located at the origin $x=0$ emits a flash of light. The light propagates outwards in all directions. Two stationary detectors are placed along the positive $x$-axis. The first detector is at position $x_1 = L$ and the second is at $x_2 = 2L$.\n\nA spacecraft, whose reference frame is denoted $S'$, moves at a constant velocity $v$ in the positive $x$-direction relative to the lab frame $S$. The origins of the two frames coincide at the moment the light flash is emitted, i.e., at $t = t' = 0$.\n\nDetermine the time interval between the activation of the first detector and the activation of the second detector, as measured by an observer inside the spacecraft. Your answer should be a symbolic expression in terms of $L$, $v$, and the speed of light, $c$.", "solution": "Let the lab frame be $S$ with coordinates $(t, x)$ and the spacecraft's frame be $S'$ with coordinates $(t', x')$.\n\nFirst, we determine the spacetime coordinates of the two detection events in the lab frame $S$.

The time it takes for the light to travel this distance is $t_1 = \\frac{x_1}{c} = \\frac{L}{c}$.

The time it takes for the light to travel this distance is $t_2 = \\frac{x_2}{c} = \\frac{2L}{c}$. So, the spacetime coordinates of E2 in frame $S$ are $(t_2, x_2) = (\\frac{2L}{c}, 2L)$.\n\nNext, we need to find the times of these events in the spacecraft's frame, $S'$.
