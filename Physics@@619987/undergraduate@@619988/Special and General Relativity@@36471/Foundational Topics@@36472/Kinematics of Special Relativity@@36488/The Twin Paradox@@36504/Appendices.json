According to the problem statement, this event occurs when Bob is at the halfway point of his outbound journey. In the Earth frame, this position is $x_{emit} = L/2$. Since Bob travels at a constant speed $v$, the time it takes for him to travel this distance from Earth is given by the standard kinematic relation for constant velocity.

The signal is emitted from the position $x_{emit} = L/2$ and travels towards Earth at $x=0$. The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant, $c$, for all inertial observers.
