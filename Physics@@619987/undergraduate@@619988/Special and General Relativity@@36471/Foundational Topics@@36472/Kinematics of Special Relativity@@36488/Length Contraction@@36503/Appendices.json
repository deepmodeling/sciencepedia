In its own rest frame, a daton has a proper length of $L_{0}$. To be analyzed, a daton is accelerated and sent through a diagnostic scanner, which has an aperture of proper width $W$. For a successful measurement, the entire daton must be fully contained within the scanner's aperture at a single instant as observed in the laboratory frame (the rest frame of the scanner). It is given that the daton is longer than the aperture width in their respective rest frames, i.e., $L_{0} > W$. The daton travels along its longest axis, which is perfectly aligned with the direction of its motion.

A mechanism is designed to close both doors simultaneously in the barn's frame S.
