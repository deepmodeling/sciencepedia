To ensure precise timing for particle detection experiments, these clocks must be perfectly synchronized. The synchronization is performed using the Einstein synchronization convention. A laser pulse is emitted from the location of Clock A at the instant its display reads $t_A = 0$. This pulse travels down the vacuum tube to Clock B.\n\nDue to a thermal expansion miscalculation, the team's surveying equipment provides an incorrect length for the tube. The true physical distance between the clocks is $L$, but the engineers use a measured distance of $L_{meas} = L + \\delta L$ for their calculations, where $\\delta L$ is a small, constant error.\n\nFollowing the standard procedure with the erroneous data, upon the arrival of the laser pulse at Clock B's location, the operator immediately sets Clock B's time to $t_B = L_{meas}/c$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nAfter this procedure, Clock B is not truly synchronized with Clock A in their common rest frame. Determine the resulting time offset, $\\Delta t$, defined as the reading on Clock B minus the true synchronized time at the location of Clock B. Express your answer as an analytic expression in terms of $\\delta L$ and $c$.

Then, knowing the principles of special relativity, the engineer manually sets Charlie's time display *ahead* by a carefully calculated offset, $\\Delta t_C$. Immediately after this adjustment, Charlie is transported from Alpha to Bravo in a high-speed rover that maintains a constant velocity of $v = 0.100c$ relative to the stations.
