This exercise challenges you to move beyond simple length contraction and consider the operational definition of length measurement, which intrinsically involves the relativity of simultaneity. By analyzing the spacetime coordinates of events from different inertial frames, you will derive the proper length of a probe, revealing its deep connection to the invariant spacetime interval [@problem_id:1856558].", "problem": "A research team is calibrating a new type of relativistic probe designed for astrophysical surveys. The probe has an unknown proper length, $L_0$, and moves at a constant velocity. For a benchmark test, the probe is directed to fly parallel to a stationary, rigid calibration rod of known proper length $L$ in a laboratory. Let the laboratory define an inertial reference frame S, with the calibration rod lying on the x-axis from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n\nThe probe's onboard measurement system is programmed to execute a specific sequence. It triggers a first event (Event 1) when its tail is perfectly aligned with the near end of the rod (at $x=0$). It triggers a second event (Event 2) when its nose is perfectly aligned with the far end of the rod (at $x=L$). The probe's design requires that for a valid measurement, these two trigger events must be recorded as simultaneous according to the probe's own internal, synchronized clock network, which constitutes its rest frame S'.\n\nAn observer in the laboratory frame S measures the time coordinates of these two events and finds that they are separated by a time interval $T$. Determine the proper length $L_0$ of the probe. Your answer should be an analytic expression in terms of $L$, $T$, and the speed of light $c$.", "solution": "Let S be the laboratory frame and S' the probe rest frame moving at speed $v$ along $+x$ relative to S.

The probe’s requirement is simultaneity in S': $t'_1=t'_2$. Applying the time transformation to both events and imposing $t'_1=t'_2$ gives $\\gamma\\left(t_1-\\frac{v x_1}{c^2}\\right)=\\gamma\\left(t_2-\\frac{v x_2}{c^2}\\right) \\Rightarrow t_2-t_1=\\frac{v}{c^2}(x_2-x_1) \\Rightarrow T=\\frac{vL}{c^2}$, hence $v=\\frac{c^2 T}{L}$ and $\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{c^2 T^2}{L^2}}}$.\n\nAt the same S' time (by construction), the spatial separation between the nose and tail equals the probe’s proper length $L_0$. Using the spatial Lorentz transformation, the separation in S' between Event 2 and Event 1 is $L_0=x'_2-x'_1=\\gamma\\big[(x_2-v t_2)-(x_1-v t_1)\\big] = \\gamma\\big[(x_2-x_1)-v(t_2-t_1)\\big] = \\gamma(L-v T)$.\n\nSubstitute $v=\\frac{c^2 T}{L}$: $L-v T=L-\\frac{c^2 T^2}{L}=\\frac{L^2-c^2 T^2}{L}$, so $L_0=\\gamma\\,\\frac{L^2-c^2 T^2}{L} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{c^2 T^2}{L^2}}}\\cdot\\frac{L^2-c^2 T^2}{L} = \\sqrt{L^2-c^2 T^2}$.\n\nThis also follows directly from invariance of the spacetime interval for a pair of events simultaneous in S': $L_0^2 = (\\Delta x')^2 = (\\Delta x)^2 - c^2(\\Delta t)^2 = L^2 - c^2T^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{L^{2}-c^{2}T^{2}}}$$", "id": "1856558"}, {"introduction": "While special relativity deals with the flat spacetime of inertial frames, general relativity describes a universe where mass and energy curve spacetime, profoundly affecting our measurement of distance.
