This problem involves an object emitting a particle at an angle to its direction of motion, a common scenario in particle physics. To find the particle's speed in the lab frame, you must use the complete set of Lorentz velocity transformations, accounting for the components both parallel and perpendicular to the motion [@problem_id:1880161].
