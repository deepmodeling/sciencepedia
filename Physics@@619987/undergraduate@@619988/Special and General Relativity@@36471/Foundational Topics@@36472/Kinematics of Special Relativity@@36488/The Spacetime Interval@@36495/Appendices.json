A key principle of special relativity is that the spacetime interval is an invariant quantity, meaning it has the same value for all inertial observers. We can therefore calculate this value in whichever inertial frame is most convenient.\n\nLet's first analyze the events in the station frame (S). We can set up a coordinate system in S such that the platform lies along the x-axis from $x=0$ to $x=L_p$. The train moves in the positive x-direction. The two events are the firings of the paint guns.\n\nEvent 1: The paint gun at one end ($x_1=0$) fires.\nEvent 2: The paint gun at the other end ($x_2=L_p$) fires.\n\nThe problem states that these events are simultaneous in the station frame.

The train frame S' moves with velocity $v$ relative to the station frame S along the positive x-axis.
