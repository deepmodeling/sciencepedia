[@problem_id:1823405]", "problem": "In the theory of special relativity, the relationship between the coordinates of an event as measured in two different inertial reference frames is described by a coordinate transformation. The standard Lorentz transformations are linear. This linearity is a direct consequence of fundamental assumptions about the nature of spacetime, particularly the principle of homogeneity, which states that the laws of physics are the same at every point in space.\n\nLet us explore the consequences of violating this linearity. Consider two inertial reference frames, S and S'. Frame S' moves with a constant velocity $v$ along the positive x-axis relative to frame S. We propose a hypothetical, non-linear transformation for the spatial coordinate $x$:\n\n$$x' = \\gamma (x - vt) + \\delta x^2$$\n\nHere, $(x, t)$ are the coordinates in frame S, $x'$ is the spatial coordinate in frame S', $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor, and $\\delta$ is a small constant with the appropriate units. Assume the transformations for the other coordinates ($y, z, t$) remain the standard Lorentz transformations.\n\nA rigid rod of proper length $L$ lies at rest along the x-axis in frame S. To quantify the effect of the non-linear term, an observer in S' measures the rod's length under two different conditions. The \"length\" in S' is determined by finding the coordinates of the rod's endpoints, $x'_1$ and $x'_2$, from events that are simultaneous at time $t=0$ in frame S, and then calculating the distance $|x'_2 - x'_1|$.\n\nFirst, the rod is placed such that its endpoints in S are at $x_1 = d$ and $x_2 = d+L$. The measured length in S' is denoted $L'_A$.\nSecond, the rod is moved to a new position, with its endpoints in S at $x_1 = D$ and $x_2 = D+L$. The measured length in S' is now $L'_B$.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, assume that $v, c, L, d, D,$ and $\\delta$ are all positive real constants, with $D > d$. Also assume that the parameters are such that the ordering of the endpoints is preserved in the transformation (i.e., the transformed coordinate of the right end is always greater than the transformed coordinate of the left end).\n\nCalculate the difference in the measured lengths, $\\Delta L' = L'_B - L'_A$.

The rod is at rest in $S$, so its endpoints are fixed at $(x_{1},t)$ and $(x_{2},t)$ for any $t$. The measurement procedure specifies using events that are simultaneous at $t=0$ in $S$, and the length in $S'$ is computed as the spatial separation $|x'_{2}-x'_{1}|$ of those transformed endpoints. Under the stated assumption that the ordering of endpoints is preserved, we may drop the absolute value and use $x'_{2}-x'_{1}$ directly.\n\nEvaluate the transformation at $t=0$:\n$$x'=\\gamma x+\\delta x^{2},$$\nsince the $-\\,\\gamma v t$ term vanishes.\n\nCase A: endpoints at $x_{1}=d$ and $x_{2}=d+L$.
