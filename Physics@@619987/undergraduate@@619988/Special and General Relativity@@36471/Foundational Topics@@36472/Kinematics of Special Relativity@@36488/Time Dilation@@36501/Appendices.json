According to theoretical predictions, these chronons have a proper lifetime of $\\tau_0$, which is the time an observer co-moving with a chronon would measure for it to decay. In the laboratory frame, a detector array measures the average lifetime of these chronons as they travel at a constant high speed. The experimental result for the average lifetime in the laboratory frame, $\\tau$, is found to be precisely $\\frac{5}{3}$ times the proper lifetime $\\tau_0$.\n\nBased on this experimental observation, determine the ratio of a single chronon's kinetic energy to its rest mass energy.
