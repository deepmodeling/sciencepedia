While the geometric path difference is a primary contributor, it is essential to account for all sources of phase change.

This source is positioned at a small height $h$ above the plane of a long, flat mirror. A vertical screen is placed at a large horizontal distance $D$ from the source, such that $D \\gg h$. An interference pattern is observed on the screen, formed by the superposition of light traveling directly from the source to the screen and light that reflects off the mirror before reaching the screen. The reflection from the mirror's surface is an external reflection from an optically denser medium, which introduces a constant phase shift of $\\pi$ radians to the reflected wave for all wavelengths.\n\nThe \"central fringe\" is defined as the fringe located at the position on the screen where the geometric path length difference between the direct and reflected rays is exactly zero. This point lies in the plane of the mirror's surface extended to the screen. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the appearance of this central fringe?\n\nA. It is a bright white fringe, as the zero path difference leads to constructive interference for all wavelengths.\n\nB. It is a dark fringe, as the phase shift upon reflection leads to destructive interference for all wavelengths.\n\nC. It is a colored fringe with the color being violet, as this corresponds to the condition for constructive interference for the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum.\n\nD. It is a colored fringe with the color being red, as this corresponds to the condition for constructive interference for the longest wavelength in the visible spectrum.\n\nE. Its appearance cannot be determined without knowing the exact dimensions of the setup, such as the height $h$ and the distance $D$.", "solution": "In Lloyd’s mirror, the reflected ray undergoes an external reflection from an optically denser medium, which contributes a constant phase shift of $\\pi$ to the reflected wave for all wavelengths. Let the direct and reflected optical path lengths from the source to a point on the screen be $\\ell_{d}$ and $\\ell_{r}$, respectively, and define the geometric path difference $\\Delta \\ell = \\ell_{r} - \\ell_{d}$. For a monochromatic component of wavelength $\\lambda$, the phase difference between the reflected and direct waves at the screen is\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = k\\,\\Delta \\ell + \\pi,\\quad k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}.\n$$\nThe resultant intensity from the superposition of the two waves is\n$$\nI = I_{d} + I_{r} + 2\\sqrt{I_{d}I_{r}}\\cos(\\Delta \\phi),\n$$\nwhere $I_{d}$ and $I_{r}$ are the individual intensities of the direct and reflected waves at the observation point.\n\nAt the “central fringe,” by definition, the geometric path difference vanishes, so $\\Delta \\ell = 0$. Therefore, for every wavelength,\n$$\n\\Delta \\phi = \\pi,\n$$\nwhich implies\n$$\nI = I_{d} + I_{r} - 2\\sqrt{I_{d}I_{r}} = \\left(\\sqrt{I_{d}} - \\sqrt{I_{r}}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nThis is the minimum possible intensity for the given $I_{d}$ and $I_{r}$ and becomes exactly zero if $I_{d} = I_{r}$. Crucially, because the $\\pi$ phase shift is wavelength-independent, the destructive condition at $\\Delta \\ell = 0$ holds for all spectral components of the white light. Hence the central fringe is dark (not colored), independent of $h$ and $D$.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is that the central fringe is dark due to the reflection-induced phase shift causing destructive interference for all wavelengths.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2235815"}, {"introduction": "The beauty of physics principles lies in their universal applicability, even when the experimental geometry is altered.
