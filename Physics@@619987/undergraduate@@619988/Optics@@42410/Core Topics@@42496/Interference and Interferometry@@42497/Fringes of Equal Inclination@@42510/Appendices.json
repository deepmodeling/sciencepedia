Calculate the interference order for the central fringe observed in the reflected light pattern. Round your final answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the interference order of the central fringe in a thin-film interference setup. The fringes produced by a parallel film illuminated by a broad source are circles localized at infinity, known as fringes of equal inclination. Each fringe corresponds to a specific angle of inclination. The central fringe corresponds to light that has been reflected perpendicularly from the film surfaces.\n\nLet the thickness of the air film be $t$ and its refractive index be $n_{\\text{air}}$. The light is incident normally, so the angle of incidence is $0^{\\circ}$. By Snell's law, the angle of refraction $r$ inside the film is also $0^{\\circ}$.\n\nWe consider two rays reflected from the film that interfere. The first ray reflects from the top surface of the air film (the bottom surface of the upper glass plate). The second ray transmits into the air film, reflects from the bottom surface of the air film (the top surface of the lower glass plate), and then transmits back out of the film.\n\nThe optical path difference between these two rays has two components: the difference in the geometrical path traveled and the phase shifts upon reflection.\n\n1.  **Geometrical Path Difference**: The second ray travels an extra distance inside the film. For an angle of refraction $r$, this path difference is $2 n_{\\text{air}} t \\cos(r)$. Since the illumination is normal, we have $r=0$ and $\\cos(r) = 1$. Thus, the geometrical path difference is $2 n_{\\text{air}} t$.\n\n2.  **Phase Shifts on Reflection**:\n    *   The first reflection occurs at the glass-air interface. Since the light ray is traveling from a medium with a higher refractive index (glass) to one with a lower refractive index (air), there is no phase change upon reflection.\n    *   The second reflection occurs at the air-glass interface. The light ray is traveling from a medium with a lower refractive index (air) to one with a higher refractive index (glass). This reflection introduces a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians, which is equivalent to an additional path difference of $\\lambda/2$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light in vacuum.\n\nThe total effective optical path difference, $\\Delta$, is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$\n\\Delta = 2 n_{\\text{air}} t \\cos(r) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\n$$\n\nInterference conditions are determined by this total path difference. A dark fringe (destructive interference) occurs when $\\Delta = (m + 1/2)\\lambda$ for integer $m$. A bright fringe (constructive interference) occurs when $\\Delta = m\\lambda$ for integer $m$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta$ into the condition for destructive interference:\n$$\n2 n_{\\text{air}} t \\cos(r) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = \\left(m + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\lambda\n$$\n$$\n2 n_{\\text{air}} t \\cos(r) = m\\lambda\n$$\nHere, $m$ is an integer representing the order of the dark fringe.\n\nSimilarly, for constructive interference:\n$$\n2 n_{\\text{air}} t \\cos(r) + \\frac{\\lambda}{2} = m\\lambda\n$$\n$$\n2 n_{\\text{air}} t \\cos(r) = \\left(m - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\lambda\n$$\nHere, $m$ is an integer representing the order of the bright fringe.\n\nThe \"interference order\" generally refers to the value of the quantity $m$ that satisfies the condition $2 n_{\\text{air}} t \\cos(r) = m\\lambda$. This value $m$ is not necessarily an integer. If $m$ is an integer, the condition for a dark fringe is met. If $m$ is a half-integer (e.g., 0.5, 1.5, ...), the condition for a bright fringe is met.\n\nThe problem asks for the interference order of the central fringe. The central fringe corresponds to the case of normal viewing, for which the angle $r=0$ and $\\cos(r)=1$.
