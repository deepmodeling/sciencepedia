Mastering this connection between a fringe shift and an optical path difference is a cornerstone of interferometric analysis [@problem_id:2271551].", "problem": "A Twyman-Green interferometer is used to characterize the uniformity of a thin film deposited on a perfectly flat substrate, which serves as the test mirror. The interferometer operates with a monochromatic light source of vacuum wavelength $\\lambda_0$. The entire apparatus is in air, which can be assumed to have a refractive index of $n_{air} = 1$. The thin film, made of a transparent dielectric material, has a uniform thickness $d$ and refractive index $n_f$. A portion of the substrate is masked during deposition, creating a sharp step between the coated and uncoated regions. When observing the interference pattern, the fringes in the region corresponding to the film are displaced relative to the fringes in the uncoated region. This displacement is observed to be exactly three-quarters of a fringe spacing. Determine the thinnest possible thickness $d$ of the film consistent with this observation. Your answer should be an analytical expression in terms of $\\lambda_0$ and $n_f$.", "solution": "In a Twyman-Green interferometer, the observed fringe displacement is determined by the round-trip optical path difference (OPD) between two points on the test surface. When a transparent film of thickness $d$ and refractive index $n_{f}$ is deposited on a mirror, the beam in the coated region travels through the film to the reflecting interface and back.
