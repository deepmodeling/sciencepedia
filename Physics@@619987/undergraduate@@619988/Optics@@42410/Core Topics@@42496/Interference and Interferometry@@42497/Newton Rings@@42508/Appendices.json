Analysis of Phase Shifts and Transitions**\n\nThe interference pattern arises from the superposition of two light rays: one reflecting from the bottom surface of the lens (lens-liquid interface) and the other reflecting from the top surface of the plate (liquid-plate interface). A phase shift of $\\pi$ occurs upon reflection if the light ray travels from a medium of lower refractive index to a medium of higher refractive index.\n\n-   **Ray 1 (reflection at lens-liquid interface):** Light travels from the lens (index $n_l$) to the liquid (index $n_g$). A phase shift of $\\phi_1 = \\pi$ occurs if $n_g > n_l$. Otherwise, $\\phi_1 = 0$.\n-   **Ray 2 (reflection at liquid-plate interface):** Light travels from the liquid (index $n_g$) to the plate (index $n_p$). A phase shift of $\\phi_2 = \\pi$ occurs if $n_p > n_g$. Otherwise, $\\phi_2 = 0$.\n\nThe total phase difference between the two rays is the sum of the phase difference due to the optical path length and the difference in reflection phase shifts:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_0} (2 n_g t) + (\\phi_2 - \\phi_1)\n$$\nwhere $t$ is the thickness of the liquid gap.\n\nThe central fringe (at $r=0$, so $t=0$) is determined solely by the reflection phase shifts.\n-   The center is **dark** if $\\phi_2 - \\phi_1 = \\pm\\pi, \\pm3\\pi, ...$ (destructive interference). This happens when one reflection has a $\\pi$ phase shift and the other does not.\n-   The center is **bright** if $\\phi_2 - \\phi_1 = 0, \\pm2\\pi, ...$ (constructive interference). This happens when both reflections have a phase shift of $\\pi$ or both have a phase shift of $0$.\n\nThe nature of the central spot transitions when the value of $\\phi_2 - \\phi_1$ changes. This occurs when either $\\phi_1$ or $\\phi_2$ flips its value.\n-   $\\phi_1$ flips from $0$ to $\\pi$ when $n_g$ crosses $n_l$.\n-   $\\phi_2$ flips from $\\pi$ to $0$ when $n_g$ crosses $n_p$.\n\nGiven the condition $n_l > n_p$, the two transition points are $n_g = n_p$ and $n_g = n_l$.
