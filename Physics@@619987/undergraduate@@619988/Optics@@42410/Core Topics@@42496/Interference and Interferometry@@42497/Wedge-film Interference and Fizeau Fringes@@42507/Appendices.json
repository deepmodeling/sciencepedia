Two flat, rectangular glass slides, each of length $L = 15.0$ cm, are laid one on top of the other. They are in direct contact along one of their short edges. At the opposite edge, they are separated by a thin polymer fiber with a precisely known diameter of $D = 80.0$ micrometers, which is held perpendicular to the length of the slides.
