In many practical applications, such as gas sensing or laser design, this medium is not a perfect vacuum and introduces absorption losses. This exercise [@problem_id:2262782] challenges you to calculate the maximum possible transmission through an etalon with an absorbing intra-cavity medium, revealing that peak transmission is no longer unity even at perfect resonance.

The mirrors themselves are assumed to be ideal and non-absorbing, meaning their intensity transmissivity $T_{mir}$ and reflectivity $R$ sum to one. The space between the mirrors is filled with a uniform medium that is slightly absorbing. When light travels from one mirror to the other (a single pass), its intensity is reduced by $2.0\\%$ due to this absorption.\n\nAn external beam of light is directed at the etalon at normal incidence.
