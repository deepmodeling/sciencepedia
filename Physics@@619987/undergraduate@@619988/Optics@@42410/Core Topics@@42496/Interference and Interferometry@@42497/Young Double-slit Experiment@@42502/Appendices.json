An interference pattern is observed on a screen placed at a large distance $L$ from the slits.\n\nNow, a modification is made to the setup. A thin, transparent film is placed directly over one of the slits. The film has a uniform thickness $t$ and a refractive index $n$. It is specifically engineered such that the optical path length for light passing through the film is greater than the path length through an equivalent thickness of air (refractive index $\\approx 1$) by exactly half a wavelength. In other words, the path difference introduced by the film is $(n-1)t = \\lambda/2$.\n\nAs a result of introducing the film, the entire interference pattern on the screen shifts. The location of the \"zeroth-order\" or \"central\" bright fringe, which corresponds to zero total path difference between the two light paths, is no longer at the geometric center of the screen.

This final exercise [@problem_id:2275090] simulates a scenario in biophotonics where a sample emits light at two distinct wavelengths.

The emitted light is passed through a Young's double-slit apparatus and the resulting interference patterns are projected onto a detector screen.\n\nFor the sensor to function correctly, the interference patterns from the two wavelengths must be spatially distinguishable. A critical failure condition occurs if a region of maximum intensity (a bright fringe) from one wavelength overlaps perfectly with a region of minimum intensity (a dark fringe) from the other, as this can lead to ambiguous readings.\n\nAssuming the standard small-angle approximation for fringe positions is valid, determine the lowest non-zero integer order, $m$, of a bright fringe produced by wavelength $\\lambda_1$ that spatially coincides with a dark fringe produced by wavelength $\\lambda_2$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the lowest non-zero order $m$ of a bright fringe from wavelength $\\lambda_1$ that coincides with a dark fringe from wavelength $\\lambda_2$. We can solve this by find a position on the screen where the conditions for both events are met simultaneously.\n\nIn a Young's double-slit experiment, under the small-angle approximation, the position $y$ of a fringe on the screen is given by specific formulas. Let $d$ be the separation between the slits and $L$ be the distance from the slits to the screen.\n\nThe position of an $m$-th order bright fringe (constructive interference) for a wavelength $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$y_{\\text{bright}, m} = \\frac{m \\lambda L}{d}$$\nwhere $m$ is an integer ($m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots$).\n\nThe position of a dark fringe (destructive interference) associated with an integer index $n$ is given by:\n$$y_{\\text{dark}, n} = \\frac{\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\lambda L}{d}$$\nwhere $n$ is an integer ($n = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots$).\n\nWe are looking for a spatial coincidence between a bright fringe of order $m$ from $\\lambda_1$ and a dark fringe from $\\lambda_2$. Therefore, their positions must be equal:\n$$y_{\\text{bright}, m}(\\lambda_1) = y_{\\text{dark}, n}(\\lambda_2)$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the positions, we get:\n$$\\frac{m \\lambda_1 L}{d} = \\frac{\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\lambda_2 L}{d}$$\n\nThe apparatus parameters $L$ and $d$ are the same for both wavelengths, so they cancel out from the equation:\n$$m \\lambda_1 = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\lambda_2$$\n\nThe problem requires finding the lowest *non-zero* integer value of $m$ for which this equation has a solution with an integer $n$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values for the wavelengths, $\\lambda_1 = 490$ nm and $\\lambda_2 = 700$ nm.

Since 5 and 7 are prime numbers (and thus coprime), this condition simplifies: the term $(2n + 1)$ must be a multiple of 7.\n\nWe are looking for the lowest non-zero integer $m$. This will correspond to the smallest non-negative integer $n$ that satisfies the condition. The term $(2n + 1)$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ generates the sequence of positive odd integers: $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, \\ldots$.\n\nWe need to find the smallest value in this sequence that is a multiple of 7. By inspection:\n- If $n=0$, $2n+1=1$ (not a multiple of 7).\n- If $n=1$, $2n+1=3$ (not a multiple of 7).\n- If $n=2$, $2n+1=5$ (not a multiple of 7).\n- If $n=3$, $2n+1=7$. This is the smallest positive multiple of 7 in the sequence.\n\nNow we can find the corresponding value of $m$ using this value of $n=3$:\n$$m = \\frac{5(2(3) + 1)}{7} = \\frac{5(7)}{7} = 5$$\n\nThus, the lowest non-zero order of a bright fringe from $\\lambda_1$ that coincides with a dark fringe from $\\lambda_2$ is $m=5$.
