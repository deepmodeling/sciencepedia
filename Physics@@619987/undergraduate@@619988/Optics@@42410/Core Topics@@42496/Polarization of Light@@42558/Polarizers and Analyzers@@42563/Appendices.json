You will learn to model a light source that is a mixture of polarized light from the screen and unpolarized ambient light reflected from its surface.

The device's screen emits perfectly linearly polarized light of intensity $I_E$, with its polarization axis oriented vertically. The device is being tested in an office with ambient, unpolarized light of intensity $I_A$ that reflects off the screen's glossy surface. Assume the reflection process does not polarize the ambient light. The total light leaving the screen surface is thus a combination of the emitted polarized light and the reflected unpolarized light.\n\nThe engineer wears a pair of ideal polarized sunglasses, which act as a perfect linear polarizer. When the engineer holds their head upright, the transmission axis of the sunglasses is also vertical, perfectly aligned with the polarization axis of the device's screen. The engineer then tilts their head by an angle $\\theta$ relative to the vertical.\n\nDerive an expression for the total light intensity, $I_{total}$, that passes through the sunglasses' lens and is perceived by the engineer, as a function of the initial intensities $I_E$, $I_A$, and the tilt angle $\\theta$.", "solution": "We consider two mutually incoherent contributions to the light leaving the screen: (i) the device’s emitted, perfectly linearly polarized light of intensity $I_{E}$ with vertical polarization, and (ii) the reflected ambient light of intensity $I_{A}$ that remains unpolarized by assumption. Because the two contributions are incoherent, the total transmitted intensity through the sunglasses is the sum of the transmitted intensities of each component.\n\nFor the emitted polarized component, the sunglasses act as an ideal linear polarizer with transmission axis tilted by an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical. By Malus’s law, the transmitted intensity of a linearly polarized beam through an ideal polarizer is given by\n$$\nI_{\\text{trans}}=I_{\\text{in}}\\cos^{2}(\\Delta\\alpha),\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\alpha$ is the angle between the incident polarization direction and the polarizer’s transmission axis.
