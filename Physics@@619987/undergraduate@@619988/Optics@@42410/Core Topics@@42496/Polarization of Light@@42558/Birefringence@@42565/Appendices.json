By determining the voltage needed to achieve a specific brightness, you will connect the principles of polarization rotation and Malus's Law to a practical, real-world application.", "problem": "This problem models a simplified pixel in a \"normally black\" Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). When no voltage is applied, the pixel appears dark. The pixel consists of a stack of optical components placed in the path of a light source. The light source emits unpolarized light. The stack, in order, consists of a first linear polarizer, a liquid crystal (LC) cell, and a second linear polarizer, often called the analyzer.\n\nThe transmission axis of the first polarizer is oriented vertically. The transmission axis of the analyzer is oriented horizontally, making it \"crossed\" with the first polarizer.\n\nThe LC cell acts as an ideal half-wave plate, meaning it introduces a phase difference of $\\pi$ radians between its fast and slow axes and does not absorb any light. When a voltage $V$ is applied across the cell, the fast axis of the LC material orients itself at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical direction. For the typical operating range, this angle is directly proportional to the applied voltage, described by the relation $\\theta = k V$, where $k$ is a constant.\n\nGiven that the proportionality constant is $k = 5.00$ degrees per volt, determine the smallest positive voltage $V$ that must be applied to the LC cell so that the final intensity of light transmitted through the entire pixel assembly is $75.0\\%$ of the maximum possible transmitted intensity. Express your answer in volts, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the initial intensity of the unpolarized light be $I_{in}$.\n\nStep 1: Intensity after the first polarizer.\nThe first component is a linear polarizer with its transmission axis oriented vertically. When unpolarized light passes through a linear polarizer, its intensity is halved, and the light becomes linearly polarized along the transmission axis. Let the intensity after the first polarizer be $I_1$.\n$$I_1 = \\frac{1}{2} I_{in}$$\nThe light is now vertically polarized. For convenience, let's denote this intensity as $I_0$, so $I_0 = \\frac{1}{2} I_{in}$.\n\nStep 2: Interaction with the Liquid Crystal (LC) cell.\nThe vertically polarized light of intensity $I_0$ now enters the LC cell, which acts as a half-wave plate. The problem states that the fast axis of the LC cell is at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical direction. The incident light is polarized vertically, so the angle between the incident polarization direction and the fast axis of the half-wave plate is $\\theta$.\n\nA key property of a half-wave plate is that it rotates the plane of polarization of incident linearly polarized light by an angle of $2\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is the angle between the incident polarization direction and the wave plate's fast axis. In this case, $\\alpha = \\theta$. Therefore, the polarization of the light emerging from the LC cell is rotated by an angle of $2\\theta$ from the vertical. The LC cell is ideal, so it does not change the intensity of the light, which remains $I_0$.\n\nLet's define the horizontal direction as the x-axis ($0^\\circ$) and the vertical direction as the y-axis ($90^\\circ$). The incident light is polarized along the y-axis. After the LC cell, the polarization is rotated by $2\\theta$ from the vertical. The new polarization direction forms an angle of $(90^\\circ - 2\\theta)$ with the horizontal axis.\n\nStep 3: Intensity after the second polarizer (analyzer).\nThe light emerging from the LC cell, with intensity $I_0$ and polarization at an angle of $(90^\\circ - 2\\theta)$ to the horizontal, is incident on the analyzer. The analyzer is a linear polarizer with its transmission axis oriented horizontally (at $0^\\circ$).\n\nAccording to Malus's Law, the intensity of light transmitted through a polarizer is given by $I_{transmitted} = I_{incident} \\cos^2(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the angle between the polarization direction of the incident light and the transmission axis of the polarizer.\nHere, $I_{incident} = I_0$ and the angle $\\phi$ is the difference between the light's polarization angle and the analyzer's axis angle: $\\phi = (90^\\circ - 2\\theta) - 0^\\circ = 90^\\circ - 2\\theta$.\n\nThe final transmitted intensity, $I_{out}$, is:\n$$I_{out} = I_0 \\cos^2(90^\\circ - 2\\theta)$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos(90^\\circ - x) = \\sin(x)$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$I_{out} = I_0 \\sin^2(2\\theta)$$\n\nStep 4: Determine the maximum possible transmitted intensity.\nThe output intensity $I_{out} = I_0 \\sin^2(2\\theta)$ depends on the angle $\\theta$. The maximum value of the $\\sin^2(2\\theta)$ function is $1$. Therefore, the maximum possible transmitted intensity, $I_{max}$, is:\n$$I_{max} = I_0 \\times 1 = I_0 = \\frac{1}{2} I_{in}$$\nThis maximum transmission occurs when $2\\theta = 90^\\circ$ (or more generally, $90^\\circ + n \\cdot 180^\\circ$ for any integer $n$), which corresponds to $\\theta = 45^\\circ$.\n\nStep 5: Find the angle $\\theta$ for the desired intensity.\nThe problem asks for the condition where the transmitted intensity is $75.0\\%$ of the maximum possible intensity.\n$$I_{out} = 0.750 \\times I_{max} = \\frac{3}{4} I_{max}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I_{out}$ and $I_{max}$:\n$$I_0 \\sin^2(2\\theta) = \\frac{3}{4} I_0$$\nThe term $I_0$ cancels out from both sides:\n$$\\sin^2(2\\theta) = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$\\sin(2\\theta) = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nWe are looking for the smallest positive voltage $V$, which corresponds to the smallest positive angle $\\theta$. We need to find the smallest positive value of $\\theta$ that satisfies this equation.\nThe solutions for $2\\theta$ are:\n$$2\\theta = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\implies 2\\theta = 60^\\circ, 120^\\circ, \\ldots$$\n$$2\\theta = \\arcsin\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\implies 2\\theta = -60^\\circ, -120^\\circ, 240^\\circ, 300^\\circ, \\ldots$$\nThe possible positive values for $\\theta$ are thus $30^\\circ, 60^\\circ, 120^\\circ, 150^\\circ, \\ldots$. The smallest positive value for $\\theta$ is $30^\\circ$.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the required voltage $V$.\nThe relationship between the angle $\\theta$ and the applied voltage $V$ is given as $\\theta = k V$.\nWe are given $k = 5.00$ degrees/volt and we found that the required angle is $\\theta = 30.0^\\circ$. We use three significant figures for the angle because the target percentage (75.0%) was given to three significant figures.\nNow we can solve for $V$:\n$$V = \\frac{\\theta}{k}$$\n$$V = \\frac{30.0^\\circ}{5.00 \\text{ degrees/volt}} = 6.00 \\text{ volts}$$\nThe result is already given to three significant figures.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6.00}$$", "id": "2220077"}]}
