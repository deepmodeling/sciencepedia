The spiral is a plot in the complex plane, where the coordinates of any point on the spiral are given by the Fresnel integrals, $(C(u), S(u))$. The complex amplitude of the electric field at an observation point is represented by a phasor, which corresponds to a vector on this diagram. The intensity of the light at that point is proportional to the square of the length of this phasor.\n\nFor a completely unobstructed wavefront, the corresponding phasor is the vector connecting the two asymptotic limiting points of the spiral, $Z_-$ and $Z_+$. The coordinates of these points are given as $Z_- = (-1/2, -1/2)$ and $Z_+ = (1/2, 1/2)$. Let the intensity of this unobstructed light be denoted by $I_0$.\n\nNow, consider the diffraction pattern produced by a straight edge. For any point in this pattern, the resultant phasor is represented by the vector that starts from a point $V$ on the spiral and ends at the asymptotic point $Z_+$.\n\nSuppose that at a particular location in the diffraction pattern, the measured light intensity, $I$, is found to be exactly one-quarter of the unobstructed intensity, i.e., $I = I_0/4$.
