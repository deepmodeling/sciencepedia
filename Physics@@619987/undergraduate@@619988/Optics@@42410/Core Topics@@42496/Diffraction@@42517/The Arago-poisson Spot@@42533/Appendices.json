The intensity of a light wave is proportional to the square of the magnitude of its total complex electric field amplitude.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the contributions from adjacent Fresnel zones. The path length from the center of the n-th zone to the observation point P differs from the path length from the center of the (n+1)-th zone by approximately half a wavelength, $\\lambda/2$. This corresponds to a phase difference of $\\pi$ radians. Therefore, the complex amplitudes from adjacent zones are opposite in sign. We can express the contribution from the n-th zone as $\\mathcal{E}_n$, where its phase alternates with $n$.\n\nLet's represent the complex amplitude from the first zone as $\\mathcal{E}_1$. Without loss of generality, we can choose a phase reference such that $\\mathcal{E}_1$ is a positive real number. Given the problem statement that $|\\mathcal{E}_n| = A_0$ for $n \\le 9$, we have $\\mathcal{E}_1 = A_0$. Due to the alternating phase, the contributions from the subsequent zones are:\n$\\mathcal{E}_2 = -A_0$\n$\\mathcal{E}_3 = A_0$\n$\\mathcal{E}_4 = -A_0$\nand so on. In general, for the n-th zone, the complex amplitude is $\\mathcal{E}_n = (-1)^{n-1} A_0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total amplitude for the reference case, which corresponds to the intensity $I_{ref}$. In this case, only the first Fresnel zone is transparent. The total complex amplitude at P is simply the contribution from this single zone:\n$\\mathcal{E}_{total, ref} = \\mathcal{E}_1 = A_0$.\nThe intensity $I_{ref}$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of this amplitude. Let the constant of proportionality be $k$.\n$I_{ref} = k |\\mathcal{E}_{total, ref}|^2 = k |A_0|^2 = k A_0^2$.\n\nNow, we calculate the total amplitude for the case with the binary amplitude mask, which corresponds to the intensity $I_{mask}$. The mask is transparent for the odd-numbered zones: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
