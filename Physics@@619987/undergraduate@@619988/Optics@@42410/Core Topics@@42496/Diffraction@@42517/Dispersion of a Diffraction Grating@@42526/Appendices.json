This practice deepens your understanding of the grating equation beyond simple vacuum scenarios.", "problem": "A diffraction grating with a line spacing of $d$ is used to analyze a light beam incident normally upon it. The experiment is first conducted in a vacuum, where the refractive index is $n_v = 1$. The incident light consists of two distinct vacuum wavelengths, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. For a specific diffraction order $m$, where $m$ is a positive integer, these two wavelengths produce bright fringes at angles $\\theta_{1,v}$ and $\\theta_{2,v}$, respectively, relative to the central maximum. The angular separation in vacuum is defined as $\\Delta\\theta_v = |\\theta_{1,v} - \\theta_{2,v}|$.\n\nNext, the entire apparatus, including the light source, the grating, and the observation screen, is submerged in a transparent, non-absorbing, and non-dispersive liquid with a uniform refractive index of $n  1$. The experiment is repeated using the same light source and grating. In the liquid, the fringes for the same diffraction order $m$ are now observed at new angles $\\theta_{1,l}$ and $\\theta_{2,l}$. The new angular separation is defined as $\\Delta\\theta_l = |\\theta_{1,l} - \\theta_{2,l}|$.\n\nDetermine the ratio $R = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_l}{\\Delta\\theta_v}$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $m$, $d$, $n$, $\\lambda_1$, and $\\lambda_2$.", "solution": "The solution involves applying the diffraction grating equation in two different media: vacuum and a liquid with refractive index $n$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the experiment in a vacuum. The standard diffraction grating equation for constructive interference at an angle $\\theta$ for light of wavelength $\\lambda$ incident normally is given by:\n$$d \\sin(\\theta) = m \\lambda$$\nwhere $d$ is the grating spacing, $m$ is the integer diffraction order, and $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light in the medium. In vacuum, the wavelengths are given as $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\n\nFor the wavelength $\\lambda_1$, the angle of the $m$-th order maximum, $\\theta_{1,v}$, is found from:\n$$d \\sin(\\theta_{1,v}) = m \\lambda_1$$\nSolving for $\\theta_{1,v}$, we get:\n$$\\theta_{1,v} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_1}{d}\\right)$$\n\nSimilarly, for the wavelength $\\lambda_2$, the angle $\\theta_{2,v}$ is:\n$$d \\sin(\\theta_{2,v}) = m \\lambda_2$$\n$$\\theta_{2,v} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_2}{d}\\right)$$\n\nThe angular separation in vacuum, $\\Delta\\theta_v$, is the absolute difference between these two angles:\n$$\\Delta\\theta_v = |\\theta_{1,v} - \\theta_{2,v}| = \\left|\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_1}{d}\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_2}{d}\\right)\\right|$$\n\nNext, we analyze the experiment when it is submerged in the liquid of refractive index $n$. A key principle is that the wavelength of light changes when it enters a medium with a different refractive index. If $\\lambda_{\\text{vac}}$ is the wavelength in vacuum, the wavelength in a medium with refractive index $n$, $\\lambda_{\\text{med}}$, is given by $\\lambda_{\\text{med}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{vac}}}{n}$. This is because the frequency of the light remains constant, while its speed changes to $v = c/n$.\n\nSo, inside the liquid, the new wavelengths for our two spectral lines are:\n$$\\lambda_{1,l} = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{n}$$\n$$\\lambda_{2,l} = \\frac{\\lambda_2}{n}$$\n\nWe now apply the diffraction grating equation using these new wavelengths. The grating itself and the angles are all within the same medium (the liquid).\nFor the first wavelength, the new angle $\\theta_{1,l}$ is given by:\n$$d \\sin(\\theta_{1,l}) = m \\lambda_{1,l} = m \\frac{\\lambda_1}{n}$$\nSolving for $\\theta_{1,l}$:\n$$\\theta_{1,l} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_1}{nd}\\right)$$\n\nSimilarly, for the second wavelength, the new angle $\\theta_{2,l}$ is:\n$$d \\sin(\\theta_{2,l}) = m \\lambda_{2,l} = m \\frac{\\lambda_2}{n}$$\n$$\\theta_{2,l} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_2}{nd}\\right)$$\n\nThe angular separation in the liquid, $\\Delta\\theta_l$, is the absolute difference between these new angles:\n$$\\Delta\\theta_l = |\\theta_{1,l} - \\theta_{2,l}| = \\left|\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_1}{nd}\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_2}{nd}\\right)\\right|$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required ratio $R = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_l}{\\Delta\\theta_v}$. Substituting the expressions for $\\Delta\\theta_l$ and $\\Delta\\theta_v$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\left|\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_1}{nd}\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_2}{nd}\\right)\\right|}{\\left|\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_1}{d}\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_2}{d}\\right)\\right|}$$\nThis expression cannot be simplified further using elementary functions and is the final answer. Note that we can remove the absolute value signs if we assume a convention, for example $\\lambda_1  \\lambda_2$, as the arcsin function is monotonically increasing. In that case, both the numerator and denominator would be positive. Without loss of generality, the expression with absolute values is the most robust form.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\left|\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_1}{nd}\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_2}{nd}\\right)\\right|}{\\left|\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_1}{d}\\right) - \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{m \\lambda_2}{d}\\right)\\right|}}$$", "id": "2227062"}, {"introduction": "A diffraction grating is a powerful tool for separating light into its constituent colors, but its usefulness has practical limits.
