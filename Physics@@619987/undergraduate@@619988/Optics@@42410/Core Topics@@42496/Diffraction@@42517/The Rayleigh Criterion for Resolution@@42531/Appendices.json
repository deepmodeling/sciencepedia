[@problem_id:2269475]", "problem": "Consider two point-like sources of light, Source 1 and Source 2, which have equal intrinsic intensity. They are separated by a small, unknown angular distance $\\theta$. The sources are observed by a telescope whose aperture is too small to resolve them according to the standard Rayleigh criterion, meaning they appear as a single blended image.\n\nThe line connecting the two sources defines an axis on the sky; let the angular position along this axis be denoted by $\\alpha$. We can set the origin of this axis such that Source 1 is at position $\\alpha_1 = -\\theta/2$ and Source 2 is at position $\\alpha_2 = +\\theta/2$.\n\nA unique characteristic of this system is that the light from the two sources is linearly polarized in orthogonal directions. Specifically, the light from Source 1 is polarized along a direction we define as the y-axis, and the light from Source 2 is polarized along the orthogonal x-axis. The xy-plane is perpendicular to the direction of observation.\n\nAn astronomer inserts a linear polarizer into the light path before the detector. The transmission axis of this polarizer makes a variable angle $\\phi$ with the x-axis. By rotating this polarizer, the astronomer can precisely measure the angular position of the centroid (the intensity-weighted mean position) of the unresolved light distribution.

The key is to relate the position of the centroid to the angle of a polarizing filter.\n\nFirst, we define the centroid position, $\\alpha_c$, as the intensity-weighted average of the positions of the two sources. The general formula for the centroid of a two-body system is:\n$$\n\\alpha_c = \\frac{\\alpha_1 I_1 + \\alpha_2 I_2}{I_1 + I_2}\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are the positions of Source 1 and Source 2, and $I_1$ and $I_2$ are their respective intensities as measured at the detector.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the positions are $\\alpha_1 = -\\theta/2$ and $\\alpha_2 = +\\theta/2$.\n\nNext, we must determine the intensities $I_1$ and $I_2$ after the light passes through the linear polarizer. Let the intrinsic (pre-polarizer) intensity of each source be $I_0$. We use Malus's Law, which states that the transmitted intensity $I$ of polarized light through a linear polarizer is $I = I_{inc} \\cos^2\\beta$, where $I_{inc}$ is the incident intensity and $\\beta$ is the angle between the light's polarization direction and the polarizer's transmission axis.\n\nFor Source 2, the light is polarized along the x-axis.
