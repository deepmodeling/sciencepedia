This problem presents a classic thought experiment that appears to contradict Babinet's principle when applied to an infinite screen, forcing a more careful examination of its foundations. By resolving this apparent paradox [@problem_id:2219913], you will grasp the crucial role of the unobstructed wave in the full formulation of the principle and understand why the oft-quoted \"identical patterns\" result has important preconditions.", "problem": "Babinet's principle in optics provides a powerful relationship between the diffraction patterns produced by complementary screens. Two screens are considered complementary if the opaque regions of one screen correspond exactly to the transparent regions of the other, and vice versa. The principle states that for a point P on an observation screen, the sum of the complex amplitudes of the waves diffracted by two complementary screens, $U_1(P)$ and $U_2(P)$, is equal to the amplitude of the unobstructed wave, $U_0(P)$, at that same point. That is, $U_1(P) + U_2(P) = U_0(P)$. A key consequence is that in any region where the unobstructed wave would be zero (i.e., in the geometrical shadow), $U_0(P)=0$, which implies $U_1(P) = -U_2(P)$. This means the intensities, $I_1 = |U_1|^2$ and $I_2 = |U_2|^2$, are identical in these regions.\n\nAn optics student observes in a Fraunhofer diffraction experiment that the pattern from a small opaque circular disk is nearly identical to the pattern from a circular aperture of the same diameter, except for the very center of the pattern. This observation seems to confirm Babinet's principle.\n\nHowever, the student is troubled by a limiting case. Consider a completely opaque screen (an \"infinite disk\") and a completely open screen (an \"infinite aperture\"). These are also complementary screens. Yet, their \"diffraction\" patterns are completely different: the opaque screen produces zero intensity everywhere, while the open screen allows the unobstructed plane wave to pass with full intensity everywhere. This appears to be a direct contradiction of the principle that worked so well for the finite disk and aperture.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical reasoning to resolve this apparent contradiction?\n\nA. Babinet's principle is derived using the small-angle approximation, which is valid for a small disk/aperture but inherently invalid for an infinite screen.\nB. The equivalence of diffraction patterns predicted by Babinet's principle only holds in the Fraunhofer (far-field) regime, whereas the case of an infinite screen must be treated as a near-field problem.\nC. The relationship $U_1(P) = -U_2(P)$ applies only to regions where the unobstructed wave has zero amplitude. For an infinite aperture, the unobstructed wave has non-zero amplitude everywhere, so this relationship is never applicable.\nD. Babinet's principle applies only to objects that diffract light significantly. A perfectly opaque screen absorbs all light and does not cause diffraction, thus the principle does not apply.\nE. The principle requires the physical material of the opaque sections of the complementary screens to be the same, a condition which is not specified for the infinite screen scenario.", "solution": "We start from the scalar diffraction formulation based on the Huygens–Fresnel principle with Kirchhoff boundary conditions. Let the incident field on the screen be $U_{\\text{inc}}(\\boldsymbol{r})$, the complex transmission function of a screen be $T(\\boldsymbol{r})$, and the propagation kernel to the observation point $P$ be $K(P,\\boldsymbol{r})$. The diffracted field at $P$ is given by the linear integral\n$$\nU(P)=\\iint T(\\boldsymbol{r})\\,U_{\\text{inc}}(\\boldsymbol{r})\\,K(P,\\boldsymbol{r})\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r\n$$.\nFor two complementary screens with transmissions $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ satisfying $T_{1}(\\boldsymbol{r})+T_{2}(\\boldsymbol{r})=1$ for all $\\boldsymbol{r}$, linearity gives\n$$\nU_{1}(P)+U_{2}(P)=\\iint \\bigl(T_{1}+T_{2}\\bigr)\\,U_{\\text{inc}}\\,K\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r=\\iint U_{\\text{inc}}\\,K\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r\\equiv U_{0}(P)\n$$,\nwhich is Babinet’s relation $U_{1}(P)+U_{2}(P)=U_{0}(P)$, where $U_{0}(P)$ is the unobstructed field.\n\nFrom this exact relation, the special consequence $U_{1}(P)=-U_{2}(P)$ follows only when $U_{0}(P)=0$. In that case,\n$$\nU_{0}(P)=0\\implies U_{1}(P)+U_{2}(P)=0\\implies U_{1}(P)=-U_{2}(P)\\implies |U_{1}(P)|^{2}=|U_{2}(P)|^{2}\n$$.\nThus, equality of intensities for complementary screens is confined to those regions where the unobstructed field vanishes (the geometrical shadow).\n\nConsider now the “infinite disk” (completely opaque) and the “infinite aperture” (completely open). Their transmissions are $T_{1}(\\boldsymbol{r})=0$ and $T_{2}(\\boldsymbol{r})=1$, which are complementary. Applying the same linearity:\n$$\nU_{1}(P)=\\iint 0\\cdot U_{\\text{inc}}\\,K\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r=0,\\qquad U_{2}(P)=\\iint 1\\cdot U_{\\text{inc}}\\,K\\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}r=U_{0}(P)\n$$,\nso $U_{1}(P)+U_{2}(P)=U_{0}(P)$ holds identically. There is no contradiction with Babinet’s principle. The reason the intensities differ everywhere is simply that $U_{0}(P)\\neq 0$ at every observation point behind an infinite aperture, so the condition $U_{0}(P)=0$ required to deduce $U_{1}(P)=-U_{2}(P)$ is never met.\n\nIn the Fraunhofer regime, the same conclusion appears in Fourier optics language. Writing the far-field amplitude as proportional to the Fourier transform of the pupil $T$,\n$$\nU(\\boldsymbol{q})\\propto \\mathcal{F}\\{T(\\boldsymbol{r})\\}(\\boldsymbol{q})\n$$,\ncomplementarity gives\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\\{T_{1}\\}+\\mathcal{F}\\{T_{2}\\}=\\mathcal{F}\\{1\\}\\propto \\delta(\\boldsymbol{q})\n$$,\nso the two far-field amplitudes sum to a delta distribution at the optical axis. Away from the axis, the two patterns differ only by the presence of this undiffracted term; exactly at the axis they differ, which explains the observed central-spot difference for a finite disk/aperture. For the infinite aperture versus infinite opaque screen, one has $\\mathcal{F}\\{T_{1}\\}=0$ and $\\mathcal{F}\\{T_{2}\\}\\propto \\delta(\\boldsymbol{q})$, which is again fully consistent with Babinet’s relation.\n\nTherefore, the correct resolution is that the inference $U_{1}(P)=-U_{2}(P)$, and hence identical intensities, applies only where $U_{0}(P)=0$. For an infinite aperture, $U_{0}(P)$ is nonzero everywhere, so that inference is never applicable. This corresponds to option C, and the remaining options are incorrect for the following reasons: the derivation does not rely on a small-angle approximation (A is false), the principle holds equally in near- and far-field provided linear scalar diffraction applies (B is irrelevant to the contradiction), diffraction does occur from opaque objects with edges and Babinet still applies (D is false), and the principle does not require identical materials beyond their scalar transmittance functions (E is false).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2219913"}, {"introduction": "Beyond comparing visual patterns, Babinet's principle is a key theoretical tool in quantitative scattering physics.
