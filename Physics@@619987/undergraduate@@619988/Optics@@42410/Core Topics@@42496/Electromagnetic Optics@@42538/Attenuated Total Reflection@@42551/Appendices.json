This first exercise explores the essential condition for TIR: the relationship between the angle of incidence and the critical angle, which is determined by the refractive indices of the two materials at the interface. By analyzing how TIR can be disrupted by changing the external medium, you will solidify your understanding of the foundational principle that makes ATR a powerful surface-sensitive technique [@problem_id:2219349].", "problem": "An optical component is constructed from a right-angled isosceles prism made of a special type of glass with a refractive index of $n_g = 1.52$. A monochromatic light ray enters one of the shorter faces of the prism perpendicular to the surface. Initially, the prism is surrounded by air, which has a refractive index of $n_a = 1.00$.\n\nThe entire setup is then submerged in a transparent, non-absorptive liquid with a refractive index of $n_l = 1.40$. The light ray continues to enter the prism along the same path. Analyze the behavior of the light ray at the glass-liquid interface on the prism's hypotenuse. All angles should be considered in degrees.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the fate of the light ray at the hypotenuse after the prism is submerged in the liquid?\n\nA. Total internal reflection continues to occur, and the ray is fully reflected.\n\nB. Total internal reflection ceases, and the ray is now partially reflected and partially refracted out of the prism.\n\nC. The light ray is completely absorbed by the liquid at the interface.\n\nD. Total internal reflection ceases, and the ray refracts out of the prism with an angle of refraction of exactly $45^\\circ$ with respect to the normal.\n\nE. The outcome is independent of the surrounding liquid; the ray only interacts with the prism material and thus undergoes total internal reflection.", "solution": "Because the light enters one of the shorter faces perpendicular to the surface, there is no refraction at entry and the ray travels inside the glass along the inward normal to that face. In a right-angled isosceles prism, the hypotenuse makes an angle of $45^{\\circ}$ with each short face, hence the angle between the ray and the hypotenuse normal is $45^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the angle of incidence at the glass-hypotenuse interface is\n$$\n\\theta_{i}=45^{\\circ}.\n$$\nTotal internal reflection (TIR) occurs for incidence from a higher-index medium to a lower-index medium when $\\theta_{i} \\geq \\theta_{c}$, where the critical angle is defined by\n$$\n\\theta_{c}=\\arcsin\\!\\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{out}}}{n_{\\text{in}}}\\right).\n$$\nInitially in air, $n_{\\text{in}}=n_{g}=1.52$ and $n_{\\text{out}}=n_{a}=1.00$, so\n$$\n\\theta_{c}^{(\\text{air})}=\\arcsin\\!\\left(\\frac{n_{a}}{n_{g}}\\right)=\\arcsin\\!\\left(\\frac{1.00}{1.52}\\right)=\\arcsin\\!\\left(\\frac{25}{38}\\right).\n$$\nSince $\\sin 45^{\\circ}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\\frac{25}{38}<\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, it follows that $\\theta_{c}^{(\\text{air})}<45^{\\circ}$, so $45^{\\circ}>\\theta_{c}^{(\\text{air})}$ and TIR occurs in air.\n\nAfter submerging in the liquid, $n_{\\text{out}}=n_{l}=1.40$, so the new critical angle is\n$$\n\\theta_{c}^{(\\text{liq})}=\\arcsin\\!\\left(\\frac{n_{l}}{n_{g}}\\right)=\\arcsin\\!\\left(\\frac{1.40}{1.52}\\right)=\\arcsin\\!\\left(\\frac{35}{38}\\right).\n$$\nBecause $\\frac{35}{38}>\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we have $\\theta_{c}^{(\\text{liq})}>45^{\\circ}$.
