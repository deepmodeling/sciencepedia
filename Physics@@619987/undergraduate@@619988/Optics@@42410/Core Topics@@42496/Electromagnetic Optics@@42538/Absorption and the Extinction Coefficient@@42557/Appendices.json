This first practice focuses on the crucial relationship between optical density (or absorbance), a convenient logarithmic measure, and transmittance, the linear fraction of light that passes through a material. By converting a given absorbance value back into transmittance [@problem_id:2217157], you will develop an intuitive feel for how these interconnected concepts describe the same physical phenomenon.", "problem": "A materials scientist is developing a new type of tinted glass for smart windows. The level of tint is controlled by applying a voltage, which changes the material's optical properties. In a laboratory test, a sample of this glass is subjected to a specific voltage, and its light-absorbing properties are measured using a laser beam. The optical density (also known as absorbance) of the glass in this state is found to be exactly 1.5. Optical density, $A$, is related to the initial light intensity, $I_0$, and the transmitted light intensity, $I$, by the formula $A = \\log_{10}(I_0 / I)$. Calculate the transmittance of the glass, which is the fraction of light ($I/I_0$) that passes through it.
