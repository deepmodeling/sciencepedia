The phase shift depends on the relative values of the refractive indices of the medium of incidence and the medium of transmission.\n\nThe general rule for the phase shift upon reflection is as follows:\n1.  If a light wave traveling in a medium with refractive index $n_a$ reflects off the surface of a medium with a higher refractive index $n_b$ (i.e., $n_b > n_a$), the reflected wave undergoes a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$).

If a light wave traveling in a medium with refractive index $n_a$ reflects off the surface of a medium with a lower refractive index $n_b$ (i.e., $n_b < n_a$), the reflected wave undergoes no phase shift, which is a phase shift of $0$ radians. This is often referred to as a \"soft reflection\".\n\nLet's apply these rules to the two experiments described.\n\n**Experiment 1:**\nIn this experiment, the light wave is initially traveling in water and reflects from the surface of a diamond.\nThe refractive index of the initial medium (water) is $n_a = n_1 = 1.33$.\nThe refractive index of the second medium (diamond) is $n_b = n_2 = 2.42$.\n\nWe compare the two refractive indices: $n_2 = 2.42 > n_1 = 1.33$.\nSince the light is reflecting from a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians.\nTherefore, the phase shift in Experiment 1 is $\\Delta\\phi_1 = \\pi$.\n\n**Experiment 2:**\nIn this experiment, the light wave is initially traveling in diamond and reflects from the interface with water.\nThe refractive index of the initial medium (diamond) is $n_a = n_2 = 2.42$.\nThe refractive index of the second medium (water) is $n_b = n_1 = 1.33$.\n\nWe compare the two refractive indices: $n_1 = 1.33 < n_2 = 2.42$.\nSince the light is reflecting from a medium with a lower refractive index, it undergoes no phase shift.\nTherefore, the phase shift in Experiment 2 is $\\Delta\\phi_2 = 0$.\n\nCombining the results from both experiments, we find the pair of phase shifts to be $(\\Delta\\phi_1, \\Delta\\phi_2) = (\\pi, 0)$.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices:\nA. $(0, 0)$\nB. $(0, \\pi)$\nC. $(\\pi, 0)$\nD. $(\\pi, \\pi)$\nE. $(\\pi/2, -\\pi/2)$\n\nThe correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2246016"}, {"introduction": "The principles of phase shifts on reflection are not just theoretical curiosities; they are the bedrock of modern optical engineering, enabling technologies like anti-reflection coatings. This problem challenges you to apply these principles to a practical design scenario: minimizing reflections from a solar cell to maximize its efficiency. You will determine the optimal thickness for a thin film by orchestrating destructive interference, a process that hinges on controlling both optical path length and reflection-induced phase shifts [@problem_id:2236388].", "problem": "To enhance the efficiency of silicon photovoltaic cells, a thin layer of silicon nitride is often applied to the surface to act as an anti-reflection coating. This coating minimizes the amount of light reflected from the cell's surface, thereby maximizing the light transmitted into the silicon for energy conversion.\n\nConsider a silicon solar cell with a refractive index of $n_s = 3.88$. A thin, uniform film of silicon nitride with a refractive index of $n_c = 2.05$ is deposited on its surface. The cell is exposed to sunlight in air, which has a refractive index of $n_{air} = 1.00$. To optimize the cell's performance for the most intense part of the solar spectrum, we want to minimize the reflection of light with a wavelength of $\\lambda_0 = 550$ nm in a vacuum.\n\nCalculate the minimum non-zero thickness of the silicon nitride coating that will achieve this.

Since $n_{air} < n_c < n_s$, both reflections are \"hard\" reflections (from a lower to a higher refractive index). Each reflection thus introduces a phase shift of $\\pi$. The relative phase difference from the reflections is therefore $\\pi - \\pi = 0$.\n\nFor destructive interference to occur, the phase difference introduced by the optical path must be an odd multiple of $\\pi$.
