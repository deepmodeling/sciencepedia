After emerging from P1, the beam immediately passes through a second ideal linear polarizer, P2, whose transmission axis is oriented at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the x-axis. An \"ideal\" polarizer is defined as one that perfectly transmits the component of the electric field parallel to its transmission axis and completely absorbs the component of the electric field perpendicular to its transmission axis.\n\nDetermine an expression for the power absorbed by the second polarizer, P2.

An ideal linear polarizer transmits only the component of the electric field parallel to its axis and absorbs the perpendicular component. For unpolarized light, the average power is equally distributed between two orthogonal linear polarizations.

For linearly polarized light incident on an ideal polarizer, Malus' law gives the transmitted power as the incident power times $\\cos^{2}\\theta$. Hence, the power transmitted by P2 is\n$$\nP_{\\text{trans,P2}}=\\frac{P_{0}}{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta.\n$$\nThe power absorbed by P2 equals the incident power on P2 minus the transmitted power:\n$$\nP_{\\text{abs,P2}}=\\frac{P_{0}}{2}-\\frac{P_{0}}{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta=\\frac{P_{0}}{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta.\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{P_{0}}{2}\\sin^{2}\\theta}$$", "id": "2224377"}, {"introduction": "Next, we extend the principle of energy conservation to the boundary between two different media, a ubiquitous scenario in optics. This exercise challenges you to analyze unpolarized light incident at the special case of Brewster's angle, where one polarization is perfectly transmitted.
