The resulting pattern of transparent slits is an infinite series with the repeating motif \"slit, slit, blocked\".\n\nTo create a more realistic model, we consider each transparent slit to have a finite width $a$ and a transmission of 1, while blocked regions are perfectly opaque. The transmission function $T(x)$ is therefore periodic, with a new, larger period $L=3d$.
