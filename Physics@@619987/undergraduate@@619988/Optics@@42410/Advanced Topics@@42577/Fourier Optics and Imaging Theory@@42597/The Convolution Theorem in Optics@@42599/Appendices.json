Its performance is characterized by its Point-Spread Function (PSF), which describes the image formed from an ideal point source of light. Due to a square aperture within the system's optics, the PSF is also a square shape, centered at the origin of the image plane. The PSF is given by $h(x, y) = C$ for both $|x| \\le L/2$ and $|y| \\le L/2$, and $h(x, y) = 0$ otherwise.
