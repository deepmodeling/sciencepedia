Both systems are designed to be ideal and diffraction-limited, sharing the same coherent cutoff frequency, $f_c$.\n\nTo test the coherent system, an amplitude grating is used as the object. Its amplitude transmittance is given by $t(x) = C_1(1 + m \\cos(2\\pi f_0 x))$, where $C_1$ is a positive real constant, $m$ is the object amplitude modulation satisfying $0 < m < 1$, and $f_0$ is the spatial frequency of the grating.\n\nFor the incoherent system, a self-luminous object is prepared.
