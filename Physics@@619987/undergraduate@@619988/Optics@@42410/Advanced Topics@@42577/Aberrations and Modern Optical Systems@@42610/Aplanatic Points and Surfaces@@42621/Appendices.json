The goal is to collect light from a micro-scale Light Emitting Diode (LED), which can be modeled as a point source, and form a perfectly aberration-free virtual image. This is a critical step for creating a uniform, parallel beam of light for a measurement system.\n\nThe solid sphere is made of a special glass with a refractive index of $n_g = 1.50$.

A point source inside the sphere, at a distance $d$ from the center $C$ of the sphere, sends rays to the spherical surface where they refract into vacuum.\n\nFor a spherical refracting surface, perfect freedom from spherical aberration and coma (the aplanatic condition) for an axial object is achieved when the object and image lie at the aplanatic conjugate points of the sphere. This is a standard exact result obtained by enforcing Snellâ€™s law at the spherical surface together with the Abbe sine condition. Specifically, for a sphere of radius $R$ with refractive indices $n_{g}$ (inside) and $n_{vac}$ (outside), the aplanatic conjugate distances from the center are\n$$\nr_{\\text{obj}}=\\frac{R}{n_{g}},\\qquad r_{\\text{img}}=n_{vac}\\,R,\n$$\nmeaning that an object placed inside at a distance $R/n_{g}$ from $C$ is imaged without spherical aberration or coma to a point outside at a distance $n_{vac}R$ from $C$ (and vice versa).
