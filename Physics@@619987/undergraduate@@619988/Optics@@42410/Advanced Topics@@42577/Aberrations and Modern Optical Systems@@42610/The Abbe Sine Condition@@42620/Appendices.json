For perfect, sharp images of stars not located on the optical axis, the lens must be aplanatic, meaning it must satisfy the Abbe sine condition. However, due to design constraints, this particular lens exhibits aberrations.\n\nFor an on-axis star (object at infinity), a ray of light entering the lens parallel to the optical axis at a height $h$ from the axis exits the lens at an angle $\\theta(h)$ with respect to the axis. The deviation from the ideal sine condition for this lens is quantified by a dimensionless function called the Sine Condition Deviation (SCD), defined as:\n$$\n\\text{SCD}(h) = \\frac{h}{f_p \\sin(\\theta(h))} - 1\n$$\nwhere $f_p$ is the paraxial focal length of the lens.\n\nAfter extensive characterization, the SCD for this lens has been modeled by the following polynomial function:\n$$\n\\text{SCD}(h) = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{h}{H}\\right)^2 + \\beta \\left(\\frac{h}{H}\\right)^4\n$$\nwhere $H$ is the radius of the lens aperture, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are dimensionless coefficients that depend on the lens shape and material.\n\nThe presence of this deviation from the sine condition causes off-axis stars to appear as small, comet-shaped flares, an aberration known as coma.
