The lens has a focal length $f$ and a circular aperture of diameter $D$. The laser beam uniformly illuminates the entire aperture. Due to manufacturing imperfections, the lens is not ideal and introduces primary spherical aberration. This aberration is characterized by an Optical Path Difference (OPD) between the actual wavefront and an ideal spherical reference wavefront at the exit pupil of the lens. The OPD is given by the function $W(r) = Ar^4$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the optical axis in the plane of the pupil and $A$ is a constant that quantifies the aberration. The ideal reference sphere is centered on the paraxial focal point.\n\nAs a result of this aberration, a ray that passes through the lens at a distance $r$ from the center does not converge at the paraxial focus. Determine the transverse displacement of a ray passing through the edge of the lens pupil (at $r=D/2$) from the optical axis in the paraxial focal plane. This displacement is known as the Transverse Spherical Aberration (TSA).
