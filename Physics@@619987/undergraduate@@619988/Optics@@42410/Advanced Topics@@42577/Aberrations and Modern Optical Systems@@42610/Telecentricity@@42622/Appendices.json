An object is placed in the plane $z=0$.\n\nFor this system to provide constant magnification, even for small shifts of the object along the z-axis, two conditions must be met simultaneously. First, the chief rays associated with any point on the object must be parallel to the z-axis in the region $z < f$. Second, the chief rays associated with any point on the image must be parallel to the z-axis in the region between lens L2 and the image plane. These conditions can be satisfied by inserting a single physical limiting aperture, the aperture stop, at a specific plane $z=z_{AS}$.\n\nDetermine the coordinate $z_{AS}$ for the aperture stop.

We represent a ray by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} y \\\\ \\theta \\end{pmatrix}$, where $y$ is the height and $\\theta$ is the paraxial angle relative to the $z$-axis. Free-space propagation over distance $d$ is represented by $P(d)=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and a thin lens of focal length $f$ by $L=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nObject-space telecentricity (chief rays parallel to the $z$-axis for $z<f$) requires that, for any object point (i.e., any ray height just before $L1$), the chief ray angle just before $L1$ equals zero.

To ensure measurement accuracy, the system must produce an image with a constant magnification, insensitive to small variations in the object's position along the optical axis. This is achieved using a bi-telecentric optical relay.\n\nThe relay consists of two positive thin lenses, L1 and L2, with focal lengths $f_1$ and $f_2$, respectively. The lenses are arranged coaxially and separated by a distance equal to the sum of their focal lengths, $d = f_1 + f_2$.

The aperture stop has radius $a=\\frac{D_{ap}}{2}$. Denote an object point at height $y_{0}$ from the axis, with $|y_{0}|\\leq y_{obj}$.\n\nBecause the stop is at the back focal plane of L1, the system is object-space telecentric. For a standard $4f$ relay, we take the object plane at the front focal plane of L1; then, using paraxial ray tracing, all rays from the object point at height $y_{0}$ emerge from L1 with the same angle\n$$\nu^{+}=-\\frac{y_{0}}{f_{1}},\n$$\nindependent of where they intersect L1. This follows from the thin-lens relation for angles $u^{+}=u^{-}-\\frac{y_{1}}{f_{1}}$ and free-space propagation from the front focal plane: $u^{-}=\\frac{y_{1}-y_{0}}{f_{1}}$, hence $u^{+}=\\frac{y_{1}-y_{0}}{f_{1}}-\\frac{y_{1}}{f_{1}}=-\\frac{y_{0}}{f_{1}}$.\n\nBetween L1 and the stop plane, the ray height evolves as\n$$\ny(z)=y_{1}+u^{+}z.\n$$\nAt the stop plane $z=f_{1}$ the transverse coordinate is\n$$\nx_{s}=y(f_{1})=y_{1}+u^{+}f_{1}=y_{1}-y_{0},\n$$\nso $y_{1}=x_{s}+y_{0}$.

The key specification is that the lens should be nearly image-space telecentric. To quantify this, the engineer designs an experiment to measure the location of the lens's exit pupil.\n\nThe experiment proceeds as follows: An object is placed in front of the lens, and a high-resolution digital sensor is positioned to capture the image. The sensor is mounted on a precision translation stage that moves along the optical axis (the $z$-axis). The position $z=0$ is defined as the plane where the sharpest image is formed (the nominal image plane).\n\nFirst, with the sensor at $z=0$, the engineer measures the separation between two distinct points on the image, finding it to be $h_i = 4.000 \\text{ mm}$.\n\nNext, the sensor is moved along the optical axis away from the lens to a new position $z = \\Delta z$, where $\\Delta z = 15.00 \\text{ mm}$.
