We can model the hologram as a diffraction grating and use the grating equation to find the angles of the diffracted beams.\n\nFirst, let's determine the properties of the diffraction grating formed during the recording process. The photographic plate is in the $xy$-plane. The object beam is a normal plane wave, so its complex amplitude on the plate ($z=0$) can be represented as $U_o = A_o$, where $A_o$ is a constant real amplitude. The reference beam is a plane wave incident at an angle $\\theta_r$ to the normal (the $z$-axis). Let's assume its wave vector lies in the $xz$-plane. Its complex amplitude on the plate is $U_r(x) = A_r \\exp(i k x \\sin\\theta_r)$, where $A_r$ is a real amplitude, $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the wavenumber, and $x$ is the position along the plate.\n\nThe intensity of the interference pattern recorded on the plate is given by the squared magnitude of the total field, $U_{total} = U_o + U_r$.\n$$ I(x) = |U_o + U_r|^2 = |A_o + A_r \\exp(i k x \\sin\\theta_r)|^2 $$\n$$ I(x) = (A_o + A_r \\exp(i k x \\sin\\theta_r)) (A_o + A_r \\exp(-i k x \\sin\\theta_r)) $$\n$$ I(x) = A_o^2 + A_r^2 + A_o A_r \\exp(i k x \\sin\\theta_r) + A_o A_r \\exp(-i k x \\sin\\theta_r) $$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(i\\phi) + \\exp(-i\\phi))$, we can simplify this to:\n$$ I(x) = A_o^2 + A_r^2 + 2 A_o A_r \\cos(k x \\sin\\theta_r) $$\nThis equation describes a sinusoidal fringe pattern along the $x$-axis. This pattern of varying intensity, once developed, acts as a diffraction grating. The spatial period, $d$, of this grating is the distance over which the argument of the cosine function changes by $2\\pi$.\n$$ k d \\sin\\theta_r = 2\\pi $$\nSubstituting $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} d \\sin\\theta_r = 2\\pi $$\nSolving for the grating period $d$:\n$$ d = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sin\\theta_r} $$\nNow, consider the reconstruction stage. The hologram (grating) is illuminated by a reconstruction beam at normal incidence. This means the angle of incidence is $\\theta_i = 0^\\circ$. The diffraction of this beam by the grating is described by the grating equation:\n$$ d(\\sin\\theta_i + \\sin\\theta_m) = m\\lambda $$\nHere, $\\theta_m$ is the angle of the $m$-th diffracted order, and $m$ is an integer ($m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\dots$).\nSince the reconstruction beam is at normal incidence, $\\theta_i = 0$, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$ d \\sin\\theta_m = m\\lambda $$\nWe can now substitute our expression for the grating period $d$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\sin\\theta_r}\\right) \\sin\\theta_m = m\\lambda $$\nThe wavelength $\\lambda$ cancels out:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin\\theta_m}{\\sin\\theta_r} = m \\implies \\sin\\theta_m = m \\sin\\theta_r $$\nThe problem states that virtual and real images are formed by the first-order diffracted beams, which correspond to $m = +1$ and $m = -1$.\nFor $m=+1$, we have the angle of the first image beam, $\\theta_1$:\n$$ \\sin\\theta_1 = (1) \\sin\\theta_r \\implies \\theta_1 = \\theta_r $$\nFor $m=-1$, we have the angle of the second image beam, $\\theta_{-1}$:\n$$ \\sin\\theta_{-1} = (-1) \\sin\\theta_r \\implies \\theta_{-1} = -\\theta_r $$\nThese two angles, $\\theta_1 = \\theta_r$ and $\\theta_{-1} = -\\theta_r$, represent the directions of the real and virtual image beams, respectively, measured with respect to the normal. The angular separation, $\\Delta\\theta$, between these two beams is the absolute difference of their angles:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = |\\theta_1 - \\theta_{-1}| = |\\theta_r - (-\\theta_r)| = |2\\theta_r| $$\nThe problem provides the recording angle $\\theta_r = 45^\\circ$. Therefore, the angular separation is:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = 2 \\times 45^\\circ = 90^\\circ $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = 90.0^\\circ $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{90.0}$$", "id": "2251326"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply recreating an image, holograms can produce magnified or demagnified views of the original object, a property that depends critically on the experimental geometry and wavelengths used.
