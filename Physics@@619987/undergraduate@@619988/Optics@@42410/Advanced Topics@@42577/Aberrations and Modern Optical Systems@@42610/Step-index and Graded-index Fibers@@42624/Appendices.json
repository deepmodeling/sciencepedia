Light propagation in such a fiber can be analyzed using a ray optics model. Different rays, corresponding to different initial launch angles, travel along different paths. This difference in path length leads to intermodal dispersion, causing a short pulse of light to spread out in time as it propagates along the fiber. The temporal pulse spread, $\\Delta t$, over a fiber of length $L$, is defined as the difference between the travel times of the slowest and fastest guided rays. The information-carrying capacity of the fiber is limited by this dispersion. The bandwidth, $B$, is inversely related to the pulse spread.\n\nConsider a step-index fiber of length $L$ with core index $n_1$ and cladding index $n_2$. The fiber is placed in a medium of refractive index $n_0$. Monochromatic light is launched into one end of the fiber from this medium. The launch optics are configured such that the light rays incident on the fiber's end-face are confined within a cone of half-angle $\\theta_{in}$. It is given that $\\theta_{in}$ is smaller than the acceptance angle of the fiber, so all launched rays are guided.\n\nUsing the ray optics model, and considering only intermodal dispersion, determine the bandwidth-length product, $B \\cdot L$, for this fiber.
