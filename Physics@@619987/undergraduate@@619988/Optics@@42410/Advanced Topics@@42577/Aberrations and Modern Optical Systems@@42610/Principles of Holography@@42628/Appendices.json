Thus, with the full hologram and the original reference beam, the observer sees the original three-dimensional wavefront (the virtual image), plus the zero order and conjugate image from the other terms.\n\nIf the hologram is broken into two equal halves and one half is used, the effective transmittance becomes\n$$\nt_{1/2}(\\mathbf{r})=W(\\mathbf{r})\\,t(\\mathbf{r}),\n$$\nwhere $W(\\mathbf{r})$ is an aperture (window) function equal to $1$ over one rectangular half and $0$ elsewhere.

Physically, this means:\n1) The phase and amplitude information needed to reconstruct the entire object wave remains locally encoded in the fringe pattern at every point; therefore, any sufficiently large subaperture still generates the entire object wavefront, not just a spatially clipped portion of the object. Hence, the full car is visible rather than only half of it.\n2) The total optical power in the reconstructed object wave scales with the illuminated area. Using half the area reduces the power approximately by a factor of two, so the image is dimmer.\n3) The factor $W(\\mathbf{r})$ acts as a smaller pupil. In Fourier optics, the angular spectrum of the transmitted field is the convolution of the object’s angular spectrum with the Fourier transform of $W(\\mathbf{r})$. Reducing the aperture narrows the viewing zone (range of observation angles that receive significant energy) and reduces the available parallax. Equivalently, the observer’s ability to move laterally while maintaining a valid reconstructed view is diminished. This is not a loss of focusing information; rather it is an aperture limitation.\n\nTherefore, breaking the hologram into halves yields a complete image that is dimmer and has a reduced range of viewing perspectives. Statements that only half the car is seen (A), that nothing changes (B), that focusing information is lost (D), or that the pattern becomes incoherent noise (E) contradict the linear reconstruction term and the distributed encoding of holograms demonstrated above.\n\nThe most accurate choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2249744"}, {"introduction": "A hologram is not just a \"magic window\" but a precise optical element whose reconstruction fidelity depends critically on the illumination conditions.
