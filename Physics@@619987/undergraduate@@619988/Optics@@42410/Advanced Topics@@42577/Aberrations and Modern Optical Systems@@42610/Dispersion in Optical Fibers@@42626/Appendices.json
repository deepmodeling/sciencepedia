It is important to distinguish between the FWHM of the intensity profile, $T_{FWHM}$, and the 1/e half-width of the pulse amplitude, $T_0$. For a Gaussian pulse, these two quantities are related by $T_{FWHM} = 2 \\sqrt{\\ln 2} \\, T_0$.\n\nThe evolution of the pulse width is most fundamentally expressed in terms of $T_0$.
