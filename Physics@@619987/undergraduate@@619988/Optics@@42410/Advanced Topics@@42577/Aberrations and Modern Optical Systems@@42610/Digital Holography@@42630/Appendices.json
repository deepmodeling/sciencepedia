This allows for the simultaneous measurement of both the object's absorption (from amplitude) and its phase-delay profile (e.g., thickness variations).\n\nConsider an experimental setup where a monochromatic laser beam is split into two paths. One beam illuminates a thin, transparent object, creating an object wave $O(x, y)$ at a detector plane.
