However, these excited atoms can also lose their energy spontaneously, a process that acts as a fundamental loss mechanism and contributes to unwanted heating of the laser material. This first exercise provides a practical foundation by asking you to quantify this effect; by calculating the total power lost to spontaneous emission, you will connect the microscopic population of excited atoms, $N_2$, to a macroscopic and critical engineering parameter [@problem_id:2237897].", "problem": "In the design of a particular continuous-wave (CW) solid-state Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) system, a crucial aspect to consider is the power loss due to spontaneous emission, which contributes to thermal loading of the gain medium.
