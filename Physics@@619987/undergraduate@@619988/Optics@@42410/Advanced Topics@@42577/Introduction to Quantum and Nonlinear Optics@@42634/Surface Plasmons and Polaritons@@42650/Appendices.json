The metal is characterized by a real, negative permittivity $\\epsilon_m  0$, and the dielectric by a real, positive permittivity $\\epsilon_d  0$. At an angular frequency $\\omega$, this interface can support a p-polarized (TM) electromagnetic wave known as a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP), which propagates along the interface (in the $x$-direction) and is evanescently confined in the direction perpendicular to the interface (the $z$-direction).\n\nThe sensitivity and operational characteristics of such a sensor are critically dependent on how far the SPP's electromagnetic field extends into the dielectric medium.

The wave is evanescent in the direction perpendicular to the interface, which is the $z$-direction. The propagation wavevector along the interface, $k_{sp}$, is given by the SPP dispersion relation:\n$$k_{sp} = k_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{r,d} \\epsilon_{r,m}}{\\epsilon_{r,d} + \\epsilon_{r,m}}}$$\nHere, $k_0 = \\omega/c = 2\\pi/\\lambda_0$ is the magnitude of the wavevector in free space, and $\\epsilon_{r,d}$ and $\\epsilon_{r,m}$ are the relative permittivities of the dielectric and metal, respectively.\n\nIn the dielectric medium ($z  0$), the electric and magnetic fields of the SPP have a spatial dependence of the form $\\exp(i k_{sp} x - \\alpha_d z)$, where $\\alpha_d$ is the real and positive decay constant in the dielectric. The penetration depth $\\delta_d$ is defined as the distance over which the field amplitude decays to $1/e$ of its value at the interface. This means $\\alpha_d \\delta_d = 1$, so $\\delta_d = 1/\\alpha_d$.\n\nTo find $\\alpha_d$, we use the Helmholtz wave equation in the dielectric medium.
