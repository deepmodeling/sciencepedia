Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) are essential workhorses in quantum labs, but their response is not perfect. This practice problem guides you through developing a realistic model for a SPAD, accounting for its inherent quantum efficiency, detector noise (dark counts), and a crucial non-linearity known as saturation [@problem_id:2254955]. Mastering this model is fundamental for correctly designing experiments and interpreting single-photon counting data.", "problem": "In a quantum optics experiment, a weak pulsed laser illuminates a Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD). The light source is coherent, and the number of photons, $n$, arriving at the detector in any given pulse follows a Poisson distribution with a mean value of $\\mu$.\n\nThe detector itself is characterized by two key parameters:\n1.  **Quantum Efficiency ($\\eta$):** This is the probability that a single photon incident on the detector will successfully trigger an avalanche and be detected.\n2.  **Dark Count Probability ($P_{dark}$):** This is the probability that the detector will fire due to thermal noise or other background effects during a measurement window, even if no photons are incident.\n\nA crucial characteristic of the SPAD is its saturation behavior. It cannot distinguish between one and multiple photons arriving within the same pulse. If one or more incident photons generate an avalanche, or if a dark count event occurs, the detector registers a single \"click\" for that pulse. Assume that the occurrence of a dark count is statistically independent of the photon arrival and detection processes.\n\nYour task is to derive a closed-form analytic expression for the total probability, $P_{det}$, that the SPAD registers a click for a given laser pulse. Your expression should be in terms of the mean incident photon number $\\mu$, the quantum efficiency $\\eta$, and the dark count probability $P_{dark}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total detection probability per pulse, $P_{det}$. A detection event, or \"click,\" can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  There is no dark count, but at least one incident photon is detected.\n2.  There is a dark count (in which case a click is registered regardless of any photon events).\n\nThe probability of a dark count occurring is given as $P_{dark}$. The probability of no dark count occurring is therefore $(1 - P_{dark})$.\nWe can express the total detection probability $P_{det}$ as:\n$$P_{det} = P(\\text{dark count}) + P(\\text{no dark count}) \\times P(\\text{at least one photon detected})$$\n$$P_{det} = P_{dark} + (1 - P_{dark}) \\times P(\\text{photon detection})$$\n\nLet's find the term $P(\\text{photon detection})$, which is the probability of detecting at least one photon, averaged over all possible numbers of incident photons.
