This reduction comes at the expense of increased noise in the orthogonal quadrature, consistent with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nA common method to characterize a squeezed state is balanced homodyne detection. In this technique, the squeezed light is combined with a strong coherent state, known as the local oscillator (LO), on a beam splitter.
