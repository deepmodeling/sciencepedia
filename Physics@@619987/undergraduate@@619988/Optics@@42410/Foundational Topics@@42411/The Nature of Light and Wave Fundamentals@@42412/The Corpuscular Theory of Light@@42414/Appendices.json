Consider a single light corpuscle of mass $m$ traveling through a transparent medium where its speed is $v_1$.

The angle of incidence, which is the angle between the corpuscle's initial path and the line normal to the interface, is $\\theta_1$.\n\nA key assumption of this model is that the interaction force exerted by the interface on the corpuscle acts entirely in the direction perpendicular to the surface. As a result, the component of the corpuscle's momentum that is parallel to the interface remains constant as it passes from the first medium into the second.\n\nDetermine an expression for the magnitude of the total momentum transferred to the interface during this refraction event.

Let the interface between the two media be the x-axis, and let the normal to the interface be the y-axis. The corpuscle is incident from the first medium (where its speed is $v_1$) and enters the second medium (where its speed is $v_2$). The angle of incidence is $\\theta_1$ and the angle of refraction is $\\theta_2$, both measured with respect to the y-axis (the normal).\n\nThe initial momentum of the corpuscle, $\\vec{p}_1$, has a magnitude of $p_1 = m v_1$. We can resolve this into components parallel (x-direction) and perpendicular (y-direction) to the interface. Assuming the corpuscle moves towards the interface (in the negative y-direction):\n$$ \\vec{p}_1 = (p_1 \\sin\\theta_1) \\hat{x} - (p_1 \\cos\\theta_1) \\hat{y} = (m v_1 \\sin\\theta_1) \\hat{x} - (m v_1 \\cos\\theta_1) \\hat{y} $$\n\nAfter passing through the interface, the final momentum of the corpuscle, $\\vec{p}_2$, has a magnitude of $p_2 = m v_2$.
