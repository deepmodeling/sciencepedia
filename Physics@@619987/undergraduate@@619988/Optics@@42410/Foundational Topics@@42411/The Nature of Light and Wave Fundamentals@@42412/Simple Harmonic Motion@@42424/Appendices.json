The cantilever has an effective mass $m$ and oscillates with a characteristic angular frequency $\\omega$. The motion is constrained along a single axis, which we label as the $x$-axis, with the equilibrium point at $x=0$. The maximum displacement from equilibrium is the amplitude $A$. For calibration purposes, it is necessary to identify the specific points in the cantilever's trajectory where its energy is evenly distributed between kinetic and potential forms. Determine all positions $x$ at which the kinetic energy of the cantilever is precisely equal to its potential energy. Express your answer(s) in terms of the amplitude $A$.", "solution": "Let the position of the cantilever at any time $t$ be $x(t)$. Since the cantilever undergoes simple harmonic motion (SHM), we can describe its potential energy $U$ and kinetic energy $K$.\n\nThe potential energy of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by $U = \\frac{1}{2} k x^2$, where $k$ is the effective spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position. The angular frequency $\\omega$ is related to the mass $m$ and spring constant $k$ by the equation $\\omega^2 = \\frac{k}{m}$, which allows us to write $k = m\\omega^2$. Substituting this into the potential energy expression gives:\n$$U = \\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2 x^2$$\n\nThe total mechanical energy $E$ of the oscillator is constant.

Therefore, we can cancel the common factor $\\frac{1}{2} m \\omega^2$ from both sides of the equation.\n$$ A^2 - x^2 = x^2 $$\n\nNow, we solve for $x^2$:\n$$ A^2 = 2x^2 $$\n$$ x^2 = \\frac{A^2}{2} $$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives us the positions $x$:\n$$ x = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{A^2}{2}} = \\pm \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$:\n$$ x = \\pm \\frac{A\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\n\nThus, there are two positions where the kinetic and potential energies are equal: $x = -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}A$ and $x = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}A$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}A & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}A \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2214109"}, {"introduction": "In the real world, oscillations are often suppressed by damping forces, a crucial consideration in many physical and engineering systems.
