The governing principle is Einstein's photoelectric equation, which relates the energy of an incident photon to the work function of the material and the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectron.\n\nThe energy of a photon with frequency $f$ is given by $E = hf$. The frequency $f$ is related to the wavelength $\\lambda$ by $f = c/\\lambda$, so the photon energy can be written as $E = hc/\\lambda$.\n\nThe photoelectric effect equation is:\n$$K_{\\text{max}} = hf - \\phi = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - \\phi$$\nwhere $K_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons.\n\nThis maximum kinetic energy is experimentally determined by applying a retarding potential, known as the stopping potential $V_s$, such that the work done by the electric field on the electron completely cancels its kinetic energy.
