The initial light source provides a beam of unpolarized light with an intensity of $I_0$, which is incident on the first polarizer. Let the transmission axis of this first polarizer define the vertical direction (0 degrees). The third and final polarizer, often called the analyzer, is oriented such that its transmission axis is horizontal (90 degrees), making it \"crossed\" with respect to the first polarizer.\n\nA second linear polarizer is now inserted between the first and the third polarizers. The transmission axis of this middle polarizer is oriented at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical transmission axis of the first polarizer. As the angle $\\theta$ is varied, the intensity of the light emerging from the final polarizer changes.\n\nDetermine the smallest positive value of the angle $\\theta$ for which the intensity of the light transmitted through this three-polarizer system is maximized.

For unpolarized incident light, the first polarizer transmits half the intensity, and the transmitted light is linearly polarized along that polarizer’s transmission axis.\n\nThe unpolarized beam of intensity $I_{0}$ is incident on the first (vertical) polarizer, so the transmitted intensity is\n$$\nI_{1}=\\frac{I_{0}}{2}.\n$$\nThe second polarizer is at angle $\\theta$ relative to the first, so by Malus’s law the intensity after the second polarizer is\n$$\nI_{2}=I_{1}\\cos^{2}\\theta=\\frac{I_{0}}{2}\\cos^{2}\\theta.\n$$\nThe third polarizer (analyzer) is at $90^{\\circ}$ relative to the first, hence the relative angle between the second and third polarizers is $90^{\\circ}-\\theta$.
