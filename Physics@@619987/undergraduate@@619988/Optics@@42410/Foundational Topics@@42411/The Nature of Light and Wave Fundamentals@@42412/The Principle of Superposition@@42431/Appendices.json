This exercise, [@problem_id:2268881], challenges you to apply the principle of superposition to a more realistic case with unequal intensities.

Due to a manufacturing imperfection in the slit apparatus, the two slits are not identical. A detector measures the intensity of the light passing through each slit individually (by blocking the other slit) and finds that the intensity of light emerging from the second slit is exactly four times the intensity of light emerging from the first slit. When both slits are uncovered, an interference pattern is observed on a distant screen. Calculate the ratio of the maximum intensity ($I_{max}$) to the minimum intensity ($I_{min}$) in this interference pattern.", "solution": "Let the individual intensities from the two slits at a point on the screen be $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ when the other slit is blocked.

This practice [@problem_id:2268904] uses the common phenomenon of a soap film to explore how phase changes upon reflection contribute to the superposition of light waves. By explaining why the thinnest part of the film appears dark, you'll apply the rules for phase shifts at interfaces between different refractive indices, adding a key physical principle to your understanding of interference.", "problem": "A vertically oriented thin film of soapy water is held in a wire loop. Due to gravity, the soap solution drains downwards, causing the film to be thinnest at the top and progressively thicker towards the bottom. The film is in air, which has a refractive index $n_{air}$, and is made of a soap solution with a refractive index $n_{film}$, where it is known that $n_{film} > n_{air}$. The film is illuminated with monochromatic light of wavelength $\\lambda$ in air. An observer looking at the reflected light notices that the very top edge of the film, where the thickness $t$ is much smaller than the wavelength of the light ($t \\ll \\lambda$), appears completely dark.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical explanation for this observation based on the principle of superposition?\n\nA. The reflection at the front (air-to-film) surface introduces a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians, while the reflection at the back (film-to-air) surface introduces no phase shift. The path length difference is negligible, so the two reflected waves are approximately $\\pi$ radians out of phase and interfere destructively.\n\nB.

Both reflections, at the front and back surfaces, introduce a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians. Since the path length difference is negligible, the two reflected waves are in phase and should interfere constructively, meaning the observation is paradoxical.\n\nD. Neither the reflection at the front surface nor the reflection at the back surface introduces a phase shift. The path length difference is negligible, so the two reflected waves are in phase and should interfere constructively, meaning the observation is paradoxical.\n\nE. The darkness is solely due to the path length difference between the two reflected waves being equal to half a wavelength, which causes destructive interference, irrespective of any phase shifts upon reflection.", "solution": "We consider normal incidence for simplicity; the same phase conclusions hold for small angles.\n\nPrinciple used: For thin-film interference, the reflected field seen by the observer is the superposition of the two dominant reflected components: (i) the wave reflected at the front interface (air to film), and (ii) the wave transmitted into the film, reflected at the back interface (film to air), and transmitted back into air. Their relative phase difference consists of (a) any phase changes upon reflection at each interface and (b) the propagation phase accumulated during the round trip through the film.\n\nAt a single interface between media with refractive indices $n_{1}$ (incident medium) and $n_{2}$ (transmission medium), the normal-incidence Fresnel reflection coefficient for the electric field is\n$$\nr=\\frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}.\n$$\nA negative $r$ corresponds to a phase shift of $\\pi$ upon reflection; a positive $r$ corresponds to no phase shift.\n\nApply this to the two interfaces in the problem, with $n_{air}<n_{film}$:\n\n1) Front interface (air to film): $n_{1}=n_{air}$, $n_{2}=n_{film}$.

With wavelength in air $\\lambda$, the wavenumber in the film is\n$$\nk_{film}=\\frac{2\\pi n_{film}}{\\lambda}.\n$$\nThe round-trip propagation through thickness $t$ adds a phase $2k_{film}t$ to the second reflected wave. Therefore, if we denote by $\\phi_{1}$ the phase of the front-surface reflection relative to the incident wave and by $\\phi_{2}$ the phase of the second reflected component, then\n$$\n\\phi_{1}=\\phi_{r12}=\\pi,\\qquad \\phi_{2}=2k_{film}t+\\phi_{r23}=2k_{film}t.\n$$\nThe relative phase difference between the two reflected waves is\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi=\\phi_{2}-\\phi_{1}=2k_{film}t-\\pi= \\frac{4\\pi n_{film}t}{\\lambda}-\\pi.\n$$\nAt the very top edge, $t\\ll\\lambda$, hence $2k_{film}t=\\frac{4\\pi n_{film}t}{\\lambda}\\approx 0$, so\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi\\approx -\\pi \\equiv \\pi \\pmod{2\\pi}.\n$$\nBy the principle of superposition, if $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are the complex amplitudes of the two reflected waves, the resultant reflected field is\n$$\nE_{r}=E_{1}+E_{2}\\exp(i\\Delta\\phi)\\approx E_{1}-E_{2}.\n$$\nFor a very thin film with symmetric surroundings (air on both sides) and negligible absorption, the amplitudes of these two dominant reflected components are comparable, and in the limit $t\\to 0$ the multilayer reduces to no interface at all, so the net reflection must vanish. Thus, with $\\Delta\\phi\\approx\\pi$, the two reflected waves interfere destructively and the film appears dark at the very top.\n\nThis matches statement A: the front (air-to-film) reflection introduces a $\\pi$ phase shift, the back (film-to-air) reflection introduces no phase shift, and with negligible path length difference the two reflected waves are approximately out of phase by $\\pi$, giving destructive interference. Statements B, C, D contradict the phase-shift rules for $n_{film}>n_{air}$, and E is incorrect because for $t\\ll\\lambda$ the path length difference alone is negligible; the key is the phase reversal at one interface.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2268904"}, {"introduction": "The principle of superposition extends beyond creating patterns of light and dark; it also governs the very nature of light's polarization.
