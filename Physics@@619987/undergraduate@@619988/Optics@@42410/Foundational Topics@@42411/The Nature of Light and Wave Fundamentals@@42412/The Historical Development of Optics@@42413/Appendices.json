The index of refraction of the air is $n_{air}=1$, and the index of refraction of both the lens and the plate is $n_g > 1$.

This practice reveals the sophistication of historical physical models and illustrates that different theoretical frameworks can sometimes explain the same evidence, highlighting the subtleties of the scientific method.", "problem": "In an attempt to create a quantitative corpuscular model for interference phenomena, inspired by Isaac Newton's qualitative concept of \"fits of easy transmission and reflection,\" consider the following theoretical framework. Light is composed of corpuscles, each possessing an internal periodic property called 'corpuscular disposition', $\\mathcal{D}$. This disposition oscillates as a function of distance traveled, $x$, with a characteristic spatial period $\\lambda_c$ that depends on the color of the light. Annihilation of corpuscles, perceived as darkness, occurs when two streams of corpuscles with equal intensity arrive at an observer with exactly opposite dispositions (i.e., their dispositions sum to zero).\n\nThe interaction of these corpuscles with a transparent boundary is governed by two rules:\n1. Upon reflection at an interface where a corpuscle would travel from a medium of lower refractive index to one of higher refractive index (a 'denser' boundary), its disposition $\\mathcal{D}$ is inverted to $-\\mathcal{D}$.\n2. Upon reflection at an interface where a corpuscle would travel from a medium of higher refractive index to one of lower refractive index (a 'rarer' boundary), its disposition $\\mathcal{D}$ remains unchanged.\n\nNow, consider the classic Newton's rings experiment. A plano-convex lens with a large radius of curvature $R$ is placed on a flat glass plate. Both the lens and the plate are made of the same material. The space between them is filled with air (refractive index $n_{air} \\approx 1$). A beam of monochromatic corpuscles, all having the same spatial period $\\lambda_c$, is incident normally from above. An observer views the system by looking at the light that is reflected straight back up.\n\nUsing this corpuscular model, derive an expression for the radii, $r_m$, of the dark interference fringes observed. Assume the paraxial approximation is valid, implying that the thickness of the air gap at a given radius is much smaller than the radius of curvature of the lens. Your expression should be in terms of the fringe order $m$ (where $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$ for the first, second, third, etc., dark rings away from the center), the radius of curvature $R$, and the corpuscular spatial period $\\lambda_c$.", "solution": "We model the observable reflected signal as the superposition of two equal-intensity corpuscular streams returning to the observer from the thin air film between the lens and the plate.

By the stated rule, reflection at a rarer boundary leaves $\\mathcal{D}$ unchanged. Denote its disposition at the observer by $D_{1}=D_{0}\\cos(\\Phi)$, where $\\Phi$ includes all common propagation contributions independent of $t(r)$.\n- Ray 2: transmission into the air film, reflection at the lower interface (air-to-glass, lower to higher refractive index), and transmission back. By the rule for a denser boundary, this reflection inverts $\\mathcal{D}$, which is equivalent to multiplying by $-1$ (i.e., adding $\\pi$ to the internal phase). Relative to Ray 1, Ray 2 also accrues an additional path in air equal to $2t(r)$, where $t(r)$ is the local air-gap thickness.
