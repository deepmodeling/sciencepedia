But what happens when the index of refraction changes continuously within a material? This practice problem [@problem_id:2252950] delves into the world of graded-index (GRIN) optics, where a light ray can be bent along a curved path. Your task is to determine the precise temperature gradient needed to guide a laser beam in a circular arc, linking the abstract concept of a refractive index gradient to a tangible outcome and a key technology in fiber optics.", "problem": "A laser beam enters a slab of a special transparent material at the origin in a Cartesian coordinate system, traveling initially in the positive x-direction. The material is designed such that its index of refraction, $n$, varies only with the vertical coordinate, $y$. Due to this gradient, the laser beam is observed to follow a circular path of radius $R$ in the xy-plane, bending towards the positive y-axis. The index of refraction at the entry point ($y=0$) is $n_0$.\n\nThe material's refractive index is temperature-dependent, governed by the relation $\\frac{dn}{dT} = -\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is a positive constant known as the thermo-optic coefficient and $T$ is the temperature. Assuming the temperature also varies only with the y-coordinate, determine the expression for the required vertical temperature gradient, $\\frac{dT}{dy}$, that must be maintained in the material to achieve this circular trajectory. Your answer should be in terms of $n_0$, $R$, and $\\beta$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dy}$ required to bend a light ray into a circular path of radius $R$. We can solve this by first finding the required gradient of the refractive index, $\\frac{dn}{dy}$, and then relating it to the temperature gradient using the given thermo-optic coefficient.\n\nStep 1: Relate the refractive index gradient to the path's curvature.\nConsider the light ray propagating in the xy-plane through a medium where the refractive index $n$ is a function of $y$ only, i.e., $n=n(y)$. The medium can be thought of as a stack of infinitesimally thin horizontal layers, each with a constant index of refraction. According to Snell's law, as a ray crosses the boundary between layers, the quantity $n \\sin\\theta$ is conserved, where $\\theta$ is the angle the ray makes with the normal to the boundary. In our case, the boundaries are horizontal, so the normal is in the y-direction.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be the angle the ray's tangent makes with the x-axis. The angle with the normal (y-axis) is then $90^\\circ - \\phi$. Snell's law applied across any horizontal line implies that the quantity $n(y) \\sin(90^\\circ - \\phi)$ must be constant along the ray's path.\n$$n(y) \\cos(\\phi) = C$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant.\n\nTo find how the ray bends, we can differentiate this expression with respect to the arc length, $s$, along the ray's path.\n$$\\frac{d}{ds} \\left( n(y) \\cos(\\phi) \\right) = 0$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$\\frac{dn}{ds} \\cos(\\phi) - n(y) \\sin(\\phi) \\frac{d\\phi}{ds} = 0$$\n\nNow we relate the derivatives to the geometry of the path.\nThe derivative $\\frac{dn}{ds}$ can be expanded using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\frac{dn}{dy} \\frac{dy}{ds}$$\nThe term $\\frac{dy}{ds}$ is the sine of the angle $\\phi$ that the tangent makes with the x-axis:\n$$\\frac{dy}{ds} = \\sin(\\phi)$$\nSo,\n$$\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\frac{dn}{dy} \\sin(\\phi)$$\n\nThe term $\\frac{d\\phi}{ds}$ represents the rate of change of the tangent's angle with respect to arc length, which is the definition of curvature, $\\kappa$. For a circular path of radius $R$, the curvature is constant and equals $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{R}$. Thus,\n$$\\frac{d\\phi}{ds} = \\frac{1}{R}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into our differentiated Snell's law equation:\n$$\\left( \\frac{dn}{dy} \\sin(\\phi) \\right) \\cos(\\phi) - n(y) \\sin(\\phi) \\left( \\frac{1}{R} \\right) = 0$$\nWe can factor out $\\sin(\\phi)$. For a path that is not a straight horizontal line, $\\sin(\\phi)$ is not always zero, so we can divide by it:\n$$\\frac{dn}{dy} \\cos(\\phi) - \\frac{n(y)}{R} = 0$$\nThis gives a general relation for the required index gradient at any point on the path:\n$$\\frac{dn}{dy} = \\frac{n(y)}{R \\cos(\\phi)}$$\n\nThe problem states that the laser beam enters at the origin ($y=0$) and is initially traveling in the positive x-direction. At this entry point, the tangent to the path is horizontal, which means the angle $\\phi = 0$. The refractive index at this point is given as $n(0) = n_0$. Evaluating the gradient at this point:\n$$\\frac{dn}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=0} = \\frac{n(0)}{R \\cos(0)} = \\frac{n_0}{R \\cdot 1} = \\frac{n_0}{R}$$\nSince the path is a circle and the medium's properties depend only on $y$, the conditions required to maintain this curvature must be consistent along the path. We will assume this gradient is what is required throughout the material for the circular path.\n\nStep 2: Relate the refractive index gradient to the temperature gradient.\nWe are given the thermo-optic coefficient, which relates the change in refractive index to the change in temperature:\n$$\\frac{dn}{dT} = -\\beta$$\nWe need to find the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dy}$. We can use the chain rule for derivatives:\n$$\\frac{dn}{dy} = \\frac{dn}{dT} \\frac{dT}{dy}$$\n\nStep 3: Solve for the temperature gradient.\nWe can now solve for $\\frac{dT}{dy}$:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dy} = \\frac{dn/dy}{dn/dT}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we found in the previous steps:\n$$\\frac{dT}{dy} = \\frac{n_0/R}{-\\beta}$$\n$$\\frac{dT}{dy} = -\\frac{n_0}{\\beta R}$$\n\nThis result tells us that to bend the light ray towards the positive y-axis (which requires $dn/dy > 0$), we need a negative temperature gradient, meaning the temperature must decrease as $y$ increases. This is consistent with the negative thermo-optic coefficient, where a lower temperature leads to a higher refractive index.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{n_0}{\\beta R}}$$", "id": "2252950"}]}
