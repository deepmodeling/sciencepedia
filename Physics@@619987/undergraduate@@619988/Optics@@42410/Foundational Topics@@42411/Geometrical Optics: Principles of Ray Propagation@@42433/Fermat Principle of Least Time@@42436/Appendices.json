An emitter is located at point $A = (0, 4.5)$ and a receiver is at point $B = (15.0, 2.5)$, with all coordinates in meters. The communication path relies on reflecting the light signal off a special reflective strip placed on the x-axis. This strip only covers the segment from $x_1 = 10.0$ m to $x_2 = 14.0$ m. The light travels through a uniform medium, so its speed is constant. According to Fermat's principle of least time, the light will follow the path that minimizes its total travel time.
