This first practice explores this very idea by considering spherical aberration, a common imperfection in real-world mirrors. By analyzing a non-ideal ray path, you will see how the principle guarantees a symmetric outcome, providing a deeper, more intuitive understanding of light propagation that does not depend on simplified formulas. [@problem_id:2268646]", "problem": "A large concave spherical mirror is used in an optical system. A ray of light, designated as Ray 1, travels from a very distant, on-axis object point, and is therefore initially parallel to the principal axis of the mirror. This ray strikes the mirror at a point $M$, which is a significant distance away from the vertex of the mirror. Due to spherical aberration, after reflection, Ray 1 crosses the principal axis at a point $P_{A}$, which is located between the mirror's vertex and its paraxial focal point $F$.\n\nNow, consider a second scenario. A new ray of light, designated as Ray 2, is emitted from the point $P_{A}$ on the principal axis. This ray is directed towards the same point $M$ on the mirror, traversing the exact same path as the reflected portion of Ray 1, but in the opposite direction.\n\nAfter Ray 2 reflects from the mirror at point $M$, which of the following statements accurately describes its subsequent path?\n\nA. It will travel parallel to the principal axis.\n\nB. It will travel towards the paraxial focal point $F$.\n\nC. It will travel towards the mirror's center of curvature $C$.\n\nD. It will reflect back along its incident path, returning to the point $P_{A}$.\n\nE. Its path cannot be determined without knowing the specific radius of curvature of the mirror and the height at which the ray strikes.", "solution": "Let the concave spherical mirror have center of curvature at $C$, vertex at $V$, and principal axis $VC$. For paraxial rays the focal point is $F$ with $f=R/2$, where $R=|VC|$, but for a marginal ray striking the mirror at a point $M$ far from the vertex, spherical aberration causes the reflected ray to intersect the axis at a point $P_{A}$ located between $V$ and $F$.\n\nThe reflection at $M$ obeys the law of reflection: if $\\theta_{i}$ is the angle the incident ray makes with the surface normal at $M$ and $\\theta_{r}$ the angle the reflected ray makes with the same normal, then\n$$\n\\theta_{i}=\\theta_{r},\n$$\nwith the normal at $M$ directed along the line $MC$.\n\nRay 1 is initially parallel to the principal axis, strikes the mirror at $M$, and then, by the law of reflection at that surface point, propagates to intersect the axis at $P_{A}$.\n\nNow consider Ray 2 emitted from $P_{A}$ and directed toward $M$ along exactly the reverse of the reflected segment of Ray 1. The principle of optical reversibility (equivalently, time-reversal symmetry of geometric optics and Fermat’s principle that the optical path is stationary under path reversal) states that any path taken by a ray that satisfies the law of reflection will be retraced exactly if the ray direction is reversed. Symbolically, if a ray connects points $A \\to M \\to B$ under $\\theta_{i}=\\theta_{r}$ at $M$, then the reversed path $B \\to M \\to A$ also satisfies $\\theta_{i}=\\theta_{r}$ at $M$.\n\nApplying this to the present case with $A$ being a direction parallel to the principal axis (incoming toward the mirror) and $B=P_{A}$, the reversed propagation from $P_{A}$ to $M$ must reflect into a ray traveling parallel to the principal axis (now away from the mirror). Therefore, after reflection at $M$, Ray 2 travels parallel to the principal axis.\n\nThis excludes the other options:\n- Not B: it does not head toward $F$, because the reversed of the original incident direction is parallel to the axis, not convergent to $F$.\n- Not C: it does not go toward $C$ unless the incident ray at $M$ were along the normal $MC$, which it is not by construction.\n- Not D: retroreflection back to $P_{A}$ requires normal incidence ($\\theta_{i}=0$), i.e., the ray must lie along $MC$. Here the incoming segment is along the reverse of the previous reflected path, not along the normal, so it does not return to $P_{A}$.\n- Not E: the path is determined by reversibility and the law of reflection without needing the specific $R$ or height at $M$.\n\nHence the correct statement is that after reflection Ray 2 travels parallel to the principal axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2268646"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the conceptual basis of reversibility, we can now apply it to a quantitative problem in classic geometric optics. This exercise uses the thin lens equation to demonstrate the beautiful symmetry between object and image formation.

Real objects (from which rays diverge) placed to the left of the lens have positive object distances. Real images (where rays converge) formed to the right of the lens have positive image distances.
