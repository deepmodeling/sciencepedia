The front face of the box, located at position $z=0$, has two small, identical pinholes, $P_1$ and $P_2$.

Thus, their coordinates are $(y_1, z_1) = (d/2, 0)$ and $(y_2, z_2) = (-d/2, 0)$ respectively. The device is used to observe a single, small, distant light source. The light from this source arrives at the camera as a set of parallel rays, making a small angle $\\theta$ above the central horizontal axis (the $z$-axis).

This problem requires you to connect the geometric principles of shadow formation with the concepts of differential calculus. By determining the rate at which a shadow's area changes, you will see how the law of rectilinear propagation governs not just the size and shape of shadows, but also their behavior over time [@problem_id:2264793].", "problem": "A point light source and a large screen are fixed in space, separated by a distance $L$.

The center of the circular disk is moving along the axis connecting the source and the center of the shadow. Let $x(t)$ be the distance of the disk from the source at time $t$. The radius of the disk is $R$. Due to the rectilinear propagation of light, we can use similar triangles to relate the radius of the shadow, $R_s$, to the radius of the disk, $R$.\n\nThe vertices of the two similar triangles are:\n1. The light source.\n2. The center of the disk and the center of the shadow.\n3. A point on the edge of the disk and the corresponding point on the edge of the shadow.\n\nThe height of the smaller triangle is the distance from the source to the disk, $x$. The base of this triangle is the radius of the disk, $R$. The height of the larger triangle is the distance from the source to the screen, $L$. The base of this triangle is the radius of the shadow, $R_s$.\n\nFrom the property of similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal:\n$$ \\frac{R_s}{R} = \\frac{L}{x} $$\nFrom this, we can express the radius of the shadow as a function of the disk's position $x$:\n$$ R_s(x) = \\frac{RL}{x} $$\nThe area of the shadow, $A_s$, is given by $A_s = \\pi R_s^2$. Substituting the expression for $R_s$:\n$$ A_s(x) = \\pi \\left(\\frac{RL}{x}\\right)^2 = \\pi R^2 L^2 x^{-2} $$\nWe are asked to find the rate of change of the shadow's area, $\\frac{dA_s}{dt}$. We can find this by differentiating $A_s$ with respect to time $t$ using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{dA_s}{dt} = \\frac{d(A_s)}{dx} \\frac{dx}{dt} $$\nFirst, we compute $\\frac{d(A_s)}{dx}$:\n$$ \\frac{d(A_s)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} (\\pi R^2 L^2 x^{-2}) = \\pi R^2 L^2 (-2x^{-3}) = -2\\pi R^2 L^2 x^{-3} $$\nThe term $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ represents the rate of change of the disk's distance from the source. Since the disk is moving from the source towards the screen at a constant speed $v$, its distance $x$ is increasing. Therefore, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = v$.\n\nSubstituting these into the chain rule expression:\n$$ \\frac{dA_s}{dt} = (-2\\pi R^2 L^2 x^{-3}) v = -\\frac{2\\pi R^2 L^2 v}{x^3} $$\nThis expression gives the rate of change of the shadow's area at any position $x$. We need to evaluate this rate at a specific instant: when the shadow's area $A_s$ is $k$ times the disk's area $A_d = \\pi R^2$.\nSo, we set the condition $A_s = k A_d$:\n$$ \\pi R_s^2 = k (\\pi R^2) \\implies R_s^2 = kR^2 \\implies R_s = \\sqrt{k}R $$\nWe can use this condition to find the specific position $x$ at which this occurs. From our similar triangles relation, $R_s = \\frac{RL}{x}$.\n$$ \\sqrt{k}R = \\frac{RL}{x} \\implies \\sqrt{k} = \\frac{L}{x} \\implies x = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\nNow, we substitute this specific value of $x$ into our expression for $\\frac{dA_s}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dA_s}{dt} = -\\frac{2\\pi R^2 L^2 v}{\\left(\\frac{L}{\\sqrt{k}}\\right)^3} = -\\frac{2\\pi R^2 L^2 v}{\\frac{L^3}{k^{3/2}}} = -2\\pi R^2 v \\frac{k^{3/2}}{L} $$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the rate of change of the area at the specified instant.
