According to the law of reflection, the incident collimated beam is reflected as a collimated beam at an angle $\\theta$ on the opposite side of the normal. The problem states that the total reflected power is $P$. Since the reflected beam is collimated and the detector is positioned to intercept the entire beam, the power collected by the detector is simply the total reflected power.\n$$P_S = P$$\n\n**Step 2: Relate total reflected power to intensity for the diffuse case.**\nIn the diffuse case, the surface is a perfect Lambertian reflector.
