In optics, the refractive power of such a lens is often specified using three parameters: a spherical power component, a cylindrical power component, and the axis of the cylinder. The spherical component provides uniform focusing power in all directions, while the cylindrical component adds focusing power along one principal meridian and has zero added power along the perpendicular meridian.\n\nThe physicist measures the lens and finds its prescription to be:\n- Spherical Power ($P_S$): $-2.25$ Diopters (D)\n- Cylindrical Power ($P_C$): $-3.75$ Diopters (D)\n- Axis ($\\theta$): $135$ degrees\n\nTo find an equivalent simple spherical lens that approximates the overall focusing effect, the physicist needs to calculate the *spherical equivalent power* ($P_{SE}$).
