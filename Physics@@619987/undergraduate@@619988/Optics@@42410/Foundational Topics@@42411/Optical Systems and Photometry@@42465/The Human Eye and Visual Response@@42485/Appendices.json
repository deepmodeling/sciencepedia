This is primarily because the cornea loses most of its refractive power, as the refractive index of water is very close to that of the cornea and aqueous humor. Consider a simplified model of a hypothetical eye that can achieve sharp focus underwater.\n\nIn this model, the eye is submerged in water, which completely neutralizes the refractive effect of the cornea. Light from the outside effectively passes directly into the eye's aqueous humor. The focusing is then performed solely by the eye's crystalline lens. We model this lens as a thin biconvex lens, surrounded on both sides by the eye's humor, which has a refractive index of $n_h = 1.336$. The lens has a front radius of curvature of $R_1 = 10.0 \\text{ mm}$ and a back radius of curvature of $R_2 = -6.0 \\text{ mm}$ (using the standard optical sign convention). For the eye to form a sharp image of a very distant object, the image must be focused onto the retina, which is located at a fixed distance $d_{\\text{eye}} = 17.0 \\text{ mm}$ from the lens.\n\nAssuming this model, what must be the refractive index, $n_l$, of the crystalline lens for the eye to form a sharp image of a distant object underwater?

This problem demystifies the optical power of a corrective lens, measured in diopters, by connecting it to the wearer's uncorrected far point—the furthest they can see clearly [@problem_id:2263745]. By calculating how this far point shifts as myopia progresses, you will gain a practical understanding of how eyeglasses compensate for refractive errors.", "problem": "An individual undergoing a routine eye examination is found to have a progression in their myopia, commonly known as nearsightedness. Their previous prescription for corrective eyeglasses was characterized by a power of $-3.0$ diopters.
