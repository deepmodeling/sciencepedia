To minimize costs, they opt for a spherical primary mirror instead of a more precisely shaped but expensive parabolic mirror. The spherical mirror has a diameter of $D = 20.0$ cm and a radius of curvature of $R = 2.00$ m. When this telescope is aimed at a very distant star, the incoming light rays can be considered parallel to the principal axis. Due to the mirror's spherical geometry, rays that strike the mirror at different distances from the center are not all focused to the same point. This effect, known as spherical aberration, causes the image of the point-like star to appear as a small, blurry disk.\n\nAssuming the eyepiece is positioned to observe the image at the paraxial focal plane (the focal plane for rays traveling very close to the principal axis), calculate the diameter of this blur circle.
