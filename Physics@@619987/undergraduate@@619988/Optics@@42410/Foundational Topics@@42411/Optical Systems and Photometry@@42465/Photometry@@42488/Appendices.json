A key test is to determine how closely the LED approximates an ideal isotropic point source over a certain range of distances. For an ideal point source, the illuminance $E$ (measured in lux, lx) on a surface is related to the source's luminous intensity $I$ (measured in candela, cd) and the distance $r$ from the source (measured in meters, m) by the inverse-square law: $E = I/r^2$. Consequently, the quantity $I = E r^2$ should remain constant regardless of the distance at which the measurement is taken.\n\nThe student uses a photometer to take two measurements. The photometer's sensor is oriented perpendicular to the direction of the light from the LED. The measurements are as follows:\n1.  At a distance $r_1 = 1.25$ m, the measured illuminance is $E_1 = 512$ lx.\n2.  At a distance $r_2 = 2.55$ m, the measured illuminance is $E_2 = 125$ lx.\n\nTo quantify the deviation from the ideal point source behavior between these two points, calculate the magnitude of the relative deviation of the luminous intensity inferred from the second measurement ($I_2$) with respect to the luminous intensity inferred from the first measurement ($I_1$).
