This exercise directly probes this relationship by asking you to consider how the ray path changes when the stop is moved from one side of a lens to the other. To solve this, you must apply the formal definition of the chief ray as the one passing through the center of the entrance pupil—the image of the aperture stop as seen from the object's perspective. This practice is invaluable for building a solid conceptual foundation of why the entrance pupil, not always the physical stop itself, is the true gatekeeper for the chief ray [@problem_id:2259423].", "problem": "An optical system consists of a single thin converging lens with a positive focal length $f$. An off-axis point object is located at a distance $s_o = 2f$ from the lens and at a height $h_o$ above the principal axis. An aperture stop, which is a diaphragm that limits the bundle of rays passing through the system, is placed on the principal axis at a distance $d$ from the lens, where $d < 2f$. The chief ray is defined as the ray that originates from the object point and passes through the center of the system's entrance pupil.\n\nWe consider two distinct configurations for the placement of the aperture stop:\n- **Configuration 1:** The aperture stop is placed in front of the lens (on the same side as the object) at a distance $d$ from it.\n- **Configuration 2:** The aperture stop is moved to be behind the lens (on the opposite side from the object) at a distance $d$ from it.\n\nLet $y_1$ and $y_2$ be the vertical heights above the principal axis at which the chief ray strikes the lens in Configuration 1 and Configuration 2, respectively.

By tracing the chief ray through this setup, you will discover a unique outcome that has profound implications for metrology and machine vision, where measurement accuracy is paramount [@problem_id:2259425]. This exercise highlights how abstract ray-tracing rules lead to powerful real-world optical designs.", "problem": "An optical instrument is constructed using two thin converging lenses, L1 and L2, aligned on a common optical axis, which is defined as the z-axis. L1 has a positive focal length $f_1$ and is located at the origin, $z=0$. L2 has a positive focal length $f_2$ and is located at $z=D$.\n\nAn object is placed in the region $z<0$ at a position $z=-s_o$, where $s_o > f_1 > 0$. An off-axis point on this object has a transverse height $h_o$ relative to the optical axis. A circular aperture stop, which dictates the principal ray for any object point, is centered on the optical axis and positioned exactly at the front focal point of lens L1.\n\nThe chief ray for the specified object point is defined as the unique ray that originates from this point and passes through the center of the aperture stop.\n\nUsing the paraxial approximation (i.e., all angles are small such that $\\tan\\theta \\approx \\theta$), determine the final angle, $\\theta_f$, that this chief ray makes with the optical axis after it has passed through the second lens, L2. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of the given parameters $h_o$, $f_1$, $f_2$, and $s_o$. The angle should be in radians.", "solution": "The problem asks for the final angle of a specific ray—the chief ray—after it passes through a two-lens system. We will solve this by tracing the ray's path step-by-step through the system using the rules of paraxial optics.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the path of the chief ray before the first lens (L1).**\nThe chief ray is defined as the ray originating from the object point $(z, y) = (-s_o, h_o)$ and passing through the center of the aperture stop. The aperture stop is located at the front focal point of L1. Since L1 is at $z=0$ and has focal length $f_1$, its front focal point is at $z=-f_1$. The center of the stop is on the optical axis, so its coordinates are $(z, y) = (-f_1, 0)$.\n\nThe chief ray is therefore the straight line passing through the points $(-s_o, h_o)$ and $(-f_1, 0)$. In the paraxial approximation, the angle $\\theta_1$ this ray makes with the z-axis is given by its slope:\n$$\n\\theta_1 = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta z} = \\frac{h_o - 0}{-s_o - (-f_1)} = \\frac{h_o}{f_1 - s_o}\n$$\nThis is the angle of the chief ray as it travels towards the first lens, L1.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the height and angle of the ray as it interacts with L1.**\nThe ray must first travel from the object a distance $s_o$ to reach L1 at $z=0$. We need to find the height $y_1$ at which the ray strikes L1. We can use the point-slope form of the line for the ray, using the point $(-f_1, 0)$ and the slope $\\theta_1$:\n$$\ny(z) - 0 = \\theta_1 (z - (-f_1))\n$$\n$$\ny(z) = \\theta_1 (z + f_1)\n$$\nTo find the height $y_1$ at the lens L1, we evaluate this at $z=0$:\n$$\ny_1 = y(0) = \\theta_1 (0 + f_1) = \\theta_1 f_1\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\theta_1$ from Step 1:\n$$\ny_1 = \\left(\\frac{h_o}{f_1 - s_o}\\right) f_1 = \\frac{h_o f_1}{f_1 - s_o}\n$$\nNow we apply the thin lens ray tracing equation to find the angle $\\theta_2$ of the ray immediately after it exits L1. The equation is $\\theta_{\\text{out}} = \\theta_{\\text{in}} - \\frac{y}{f}$.\nFor L1, $\\theta_{\\text{in}} = \\theta_1$, $y = y_1$, and $f=f_1$.\n$$\n\\theta_2 = \\theta_1 - \\frac{y_1}{f_1}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\theta_1$ and $y_1$:\n$$\n\\theta_2 = \\left(\\frac{h_o}{f_1 - s_o}\\right) - \\frac{1}{f_1} \\left(\\frac{h_o f_1}{f_1 - s_o}\\right) = \\frac{h_o}{f_1 - s_o} - \\frac{h_o}{f_1 - s_o} = 0\n$$\nThis is a crucial intermediate result. Because the chief ray passed through the front focal point of L1, it emerges from L1 parallel to the optical axis.\n\n**Step 3: Propagate the ray from L1 to L2.**\nThe ray leaves L1 at $z=0$ with height $y_1$ and angle $\\theta_2 = 0$. It travels towards L2, which is at $z=D$. Since the ray is parallel to the axis ($\\theta_2=0$), its height does not change during this propagation. Therefore, the height $y_2$ at which the ray strikes L2 is:\n$$\ny_2 = y_1 = \\frac{h_o f_1}{f_1 - s_o}\n$$\nThe angle of the ray just before hitting L2 is still $\\theta_2=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the final angle of the ray after passing through L2.**\nWe apply the thin lens ray tracing equation to L2. The incoming ray has angle $\\theta_{\\text{in}} = \\theta_2 = 0$ and strikes the lens at height $y_2$. The focal length is $f_2$. The final outgoing angle $\\theta_f$ is:\n$$\n\\theta_f = \\theta_2 - \\frac{y_2}{f_2} = 0 - \\frac{y_2}{f_2} = -\\frac{y_2}{f_2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $y_2$:\n$$\n\\theta_f = -\\frac{1}{f_2} \\left(\\frac{h_o f_1}{f_1 - s_o}\\right)\n$$\nTo write the expression in a conventional form, we can absorb the negative sign into the denominator:\n$$\n\\theta_f = \\frac{h_o f_1}{f_2 (s_o - f_1)}\n$$\nThis is the final angle of the chief ray after passing through the entire system. Notably, the result is independent of the lens separation distance $D$, which is a direct consequence of the ray being parallel to the axis between the two lenses.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{h_o f_1}{f_2 (s_o - f_1)}}$$", "id": "2259425"}, {"introduction": "While the chief ray determines the center of an image point, the quality and sharpness of that point are determined by the entire bundle of rays collected by the lens, bounded by the marginal rays.
