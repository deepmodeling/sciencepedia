The location of $N_1$ is its distance $p_1$ from the first vertex $V_1$ (the convex surface), and the location of $N_2$ is its distance $p_2$ from the second vertex $V_2$ (the planar surface).\n\nSince the lens is in a uniform medium (air on both sides), its nodal points ($N_1, N_2$) coincide with its principal points ($H_1, H_2$). Therefore, our task is to find the locations of the principal points. We can determine these locations, $p_1 = \\overline{V_1H_1}$ and $p_2 = \\overline{V_2H_2}$, by first calculating the effective focal length ($f$), the front focal length (FFL), and the back focal length (BFL).\n\nLet the principal axis be the z-axis, with the first vertex $V_1$ at $z=0$ and the second vertex $V_2$ at $z=d$. Light is incident from the left, so it travels in the positive z-direction. According to the sign convention, the radius of curvature of the convex surface is $R_1 = +R = +12.0$ cm, and the radius of the planar surface is $R_2 = \\infty$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the effective focal length ($f$)**\nThe effective focal length of a thick lens is given by the thick lensmaker's equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f} = (n-1) \\left[ \\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\frac{(n-1)d}{n R_1 R_2} \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the given values: $n = 1.60$, $d = 3.0$ cm, $R_1 = 12.0$ cm, and $R_2 = \\infty$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f} = (1.60 - 1) \\left[ \\frac{1}{12.0} - \\frac{1}{\\infty} + \\frac{(1.60-1)(3.0)}{(1.60)(12.0)(\\infty)} \\right]\n$$\nThe terms involving $1/R_2$ are zero.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f} = 0.60 \\left( \\frac{1}{12.0} \\right) = \\frac{0.60}{12.0} = \\frac{1}{20.0}\n$$\nSo, the effective focal length is $f = 20.0$ cm.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the location of the first principal point $H_1$ (and nodal point $N_1$)**\nThe location of the first principal point, $p_1 = \\overline{V_1H_1}$, can be found using the standard formula for a thick lens: $p_1 = \\frac{f(n-1)d}{nR_2}$. Since $R_2 = \\infty$, we have $p_1 = 0$.\nThe first nodal point $N_1$ is located at the first vertex $V_1$.\n\nAlternatively, as done in the original solution:\nThe location of the first principal point, $p_1$, is related to the effective focal length ($f$) and the front focal length (FFL). The FFL is the distance from the first vertex $V_1$ to the front focal point $F_1$. The governing relation is $z(H_1) = z(F_1) + f$. With $z(V_1)=0$, this gives $p_1 = z(F_1) + f$. The FFL is the magnitude of the distance, and $F_1$ is on the left of $V_1$, so $z(F_1) = -\\text{FFL}$. Thus, $p_1 = f - \\text{FFL}$.\nTo find the FFL, we trace a ray parallel to the axis from right to left.\n- **Refraction at Surface 2 (Planar, $R_2=\\infty$):** The ray passes from air ($n=1$) into the lens ($n=1.60$) and is undeviated.\n- **Refraction at Surface 1 (Convex, $R_1=12.0$ cm):** The ray passes from the lens ($n=1.60$) into air ($n=1$). The radius of curvature for a ray coming from the right is $R_1' = -12.0$ cm. The paraxial refraction equation is $\\frac{n_{lens}}{s_1} + \\frac{n_{air}}{s_1'} = \\frac{n_{air}-n_{lens}}{R_1'}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1.60}{\\infty} + \\frac{1}{s_1'} = \\frac{1 - 1.60}{-12.0} = \\frac{-0.60}{-12.0} = \\frac{1}{20.0}\n$$\nThis gives $s_1' = 20.0$ cm. This is the distance from $V_1$ to the front focal point $F_1$. So FFL = $20.0$ cm.\nNow we find $p_1$:\n$$\np_1 = f - \\text{FFL} = 20.0 - 20.0 = 0\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the location of the second principal point $H_2$ (and nodal point $N_2$)**\nThe location of the second principal point, $p_2 = \\overline{V_2H_2}$, is given by the formula $p_2 = -\\frac{f(n-1)d}{nR_1}$.\n$$\np_2 = - \\frac{(20.0)(1.60-1)(3.0)}{(1.60)(12.0)} = - \\frac{20.0 \\times 0.60 \\times 3.0}{19.2} = - \\frac{36}{19.2} = - \\frac{360}{192} = - \\frac{15}{8}\n$$\nThe second nodal point $N_2$ is located at a distance of $-\\frac{15}{8}$ cm from the second vertex $V_2$. The negative sign means it is located to the left of $V_2$, inside the lens material.\n\nAlternatively, as done in the original solution:\nThe relation is $p_2 = \\text{BFL} - f$. To find the BFL, we trace a ray parallel to the axis from left to right.\n- **Refraction at Surface 1 (Convex, $R_1=12.0$ cm):** $\\frac{1}{\\infty} + \\frac{1.60}{s_1'} = \\frac{1.60 - 1}{12.0} = \\frac{0.60}{12.0} = \\frac{1}{20.0}$. This gives $s_1' = 32.0$ cm.\n- **Refraction at Surface 2 (Planar, $R_2=\\infty$):** The object for the second surface is at $s_2 = d - s_1' = 3.0 - 32.0 = -29.0$ cm from $V_2$. The refraction equation is $\\frac{1.60}{s_2} + \\frac{1}{s_2'} = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{1.60}{-29.0} + \\frac{1}{s_2'} = 0 \\implies s_2' = \\frac{29.0}{1.60} = \\frac{145}{8}\n$$\nSo, the BFL is $s_2' = \\frac{145}{8}$ cm.\nNow we find $p_2$:\n$$\np_2 = \\text{BFL} - f = \\frac{145}{8} - 20 = \\frac{145 - 160}{8} = -\\frac{15}{8}\n$$\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe location of the first nodal point relative to the first vertex is $p_1 = 0$ cm.\nThe location of the second nodal point relative to the second vertex is $p_2 = -15/8$ cm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{15}{8} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2242486"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, we now explore how a lens's environment alters its optical properties.
