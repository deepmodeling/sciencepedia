The design uses a single thin convex lens to focus sunlight onto a high-efficiency photovoltaic cell. We can model the sun as an object at an infinite distance from the lens, so a sharp image is formed at the lens's focal plane where the cell is placed.\n\nThe manufacturer of the photovoltaic cell specifies that for optimal performance, the numerical aperture (NA) of the cone of light incident on the cell must not exceed a maximum value of $NA_{max} = 0.240$.
