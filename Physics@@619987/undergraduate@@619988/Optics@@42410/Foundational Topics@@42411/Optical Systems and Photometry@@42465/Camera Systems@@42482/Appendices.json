The lens's internal focusing mechanism allows the distance from its optical center to the camera's sensor, $d_i$, to be adjusted. The minimum possible lens-to-sensor distance is equal to the focal length, $d_{i, \\text{min}} = f$, which is achieved when focusing on an object at infinity.

This is a simple hollow cylinder that is inserted between the camera body and the lens, acting as a spacer to increase the lens-to-sensor distance. To use the shortest possible extension tube, the photographer will set the lens's own focus to its closest setting (achieving $d_{i, \\text{max}}$).\n\nCalculate the minimum required length, $L$, of the extension tube that will allow the photographer to achieve the desired 1:1 magnification.
