Mastering this qualitative aspect is the first step toward proficiently navigating a specimen under magnification.", "problem": "A student is using a standard laboratory compound microscope to examine a biological sample on a glass slide. The microscope consists of a high-power objective lens and an eyepiece, both of which can be modeled as ideal converging lenses. The objective lens is designed to form a real, magnified, intermediate image of the sample. The eyepiece then functions as a simple magnifier, using the intermediate image as its object to form the final virtual image that the student observes.\n\nOn the slide, a tiny, asymmetric letter 'p' has been printed for calibration purposes. When the slide is placed on the microscope stage, the letter is in its standard upright orientation (i.e., it would be read as 'p' by a person looking at the slide directly with the naked eye). After focusing the microscope to get a clear image, the student slowly moves the entire slide on the stage to their physical right.\n\nBased on the principles of geometric optics for a compound microscope, which of the following statements accurately describes the orientation of the final image of the letter and its apparent direction of motion as seen by the student looking through the eyepiece?\n\nA.

The image appears oriented as a 'd' and moves to the left.\n\nE. The image appears oriented as a 'd' and moves to the right.", "solution": "We model the compound microscope as two ideal thin converging lenses: the objective and the eyepiece. The sample on the slide is the object for the objective lens. By design, the objective forms a real, magnified intermediate image, and the eyepiece acts as a simple magnifier, using the intermediate image as its object and forming a final virtual image for the observer.\n\nFor the objective lens, let $f_{o}$ be its focal length, $s_{o}$ the object distance (positive since the object is on the incoming side), and $s'_{o}$ the image distance (positive for a real image). The thin lens equation is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f_{o}}=\\frac{1}{s_{o}}+\\frac{1}{s'_{o}}.\n$$\nIn a microscope, $s_{o}\\approx f_{o}$ so that $s'_{o}>f_{o}$ and a real, magnified image is formed. The transverse (lateral) magnification of the objective is\n$$\nm_{o}=-\\frac{s'_{o}}{s_{o}}<0,\n$$\nso the intermediate image is inverted relative to the object, i.e., rotated by $180^{\\circ}$. An upright lowercase 'p' thus becomes a 'd' at the intermediate image.\n\nThe eyepiece (simple magnifier) uses this intermediate image as its object, typically placing it near the eyepiece focal plane for relaxed viewing. For a simple magnifier, the angular magnification is positive; the eyepiece does not introduce an additional inversion because no real image is formed that crosses a focus to add another inversion. Therefore, the final virtual image preserves the orientation of the intermediate image. Hence the final image remains as 'd'.\n\nTo determine the apparent direction of motion, consider a small horizontal displacement of the slide. Let $x_{o}$ denote the lateral coordinate of the object point and $x'_{o}$ that of the intermediate image. The objectiveâ€™s transverse mapping is\n$$\nx'_{o}=m_{o}\\,x_{o}, \\quad m_{o}<0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; \\frac{dx'_{o}}{dx_{o}}=m_{o}<0.\n$$\nThus, if the slide is moved to the right (increasing $x_{o}$), the intermediate image moves to the left (decreasing $x'_{o}$). The eyepiece, having positive angular magnification, preserves this sense of motion in the final virtual image. Therefore, when the slide is moved to the right, the final image appears to move to the left.\n\nCombining the orientation and motion conclusions: the final image appears as 'd' and moves to the left, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2260202"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of image orientation, we can now quantify the microscope's primary function: magnification.
