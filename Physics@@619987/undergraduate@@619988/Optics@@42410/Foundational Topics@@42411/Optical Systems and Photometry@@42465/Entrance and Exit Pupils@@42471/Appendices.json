This first exercise explores a foundational principle in optical design: placing the aperture stop at a specific location relative to a lens to control the behavior of chief rays in image space. By calculating the required stop position to place the exit pupil at infinity, you will uncover the basis for image-space telecentricity, a crucial property for precision metrology and machine vision systems where magnification must remain constant regardless of object distance.

The core of the system consists of a single converging thin lens with a positive focal length $f$. An external circular aperture, which will serve as the system's aperture stop, needs to be placed along the optical axis. To ensure that the magnification of the final image is insensitive to small variations in the object's position, the chief rays in the image space must emerge parallel to the optical axis. This condition is met when the system's exit pupil is located at infinity. The aperture stop is to be placed on the same side of the lens as the object. Determine the required distance, $d$, between the aperture stop and the optical center of the thin lens. Express your answer in terms of the focal length $f$.", "solution": "Let the thin lens have focal length $f0$ and be located at $z=0$. Place the circular aperture stop on the object side at $z=-d$. The exit pupil is defined as the image of the aperture stop formed by the lens as seen from the image space.

Substituting into the lens equation gives\n$$\n\\frac{1}{d}=\\frac{1}{f}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad d=f.\n$$\nThis satisfies the stated condition that the chief rays in image space emerge parallel to the optical axis, because placing the stop at the front focal plane makes the image of the stop lie at infinity.\n\nAs a consistency check using chief-ray slopes, let a field point at axial position $z=z_{o}0$ and height $y_{o}$ emit the chief ray that passes through the center of the stop (height $0$ at $z=-d$).

This property is achieved by ensuring the chief rays are parallel to the optical axis in both object and image space.

To make the system doubly telecentric, a single physical diaphragm, functioning as the Aperture Stop (AS), must be placed at a specific location between the two lenses. The position of this stop must simultaneously satisfy the conditions for both object-space and image-space telecentricity.\n\nDetermine the required separation distance $d$ between the centers of the two lenses that allows for such a doubly telecentric configuration.
