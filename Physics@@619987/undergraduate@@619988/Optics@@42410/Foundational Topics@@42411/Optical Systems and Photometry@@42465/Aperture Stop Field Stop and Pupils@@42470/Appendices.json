This exercise will solidify your understanding of the entrance pupil as the system's limiting \"window\" and connect abstract theory to tangible experimental data.", "problem": "An optical engineering student is tasked with characterizing a sealed optical instrument, which can be treated as a black box with a planar input face and a planar output face. The student sets up a coordinate system where the optical axis is the $z$-axis, and the input face of the instrument corresponds to the plane $z=0$. The region $z>0$ is inside the instrument. The student has access to a movable point source of light, a large area detector that measures total transmitted power, and a ruler for making position measurements.\n\nTo characterize the instrument's light-gathering properties, the student performs two experiments.\n\n**Experiment 1:**\nThe student places the point source at various axial distances, $-z_s$ (where $z_s>0$), from the input face. At each position $z_s$, they move the source transversely away from the optical axis to a position $x_{\\max}$. This $x_{\\max}$ is defined as the maximum transverse displacement for which the detector, placed at the output, registers a non-zero signal. For any displacement $|x| > x_{\\max}$, the signal is zero. The following data were recorded (all distances in cm):\n\n| Axial Distance $z_s$ (cm) | Maximum Transverse Displacement $x_{\\max}$ (cm) |\n|:--------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------:|\n|           10.0             |                      3.0                          |\n|           20.0             |                      5.0                          |\n|           30.0             |                      7.0                          |\n|           40.0             |                      9.0                          |\n\n**Experiment 2:**\nThe student moves the point source to a very large distance from the instrument along the optical axis, so the light entering the instrument is effectively a collimated beam parallel to the axis. They then use the straight edge of the ruler as a knife-edge, sliding it across the input face of the instrument in the transverse ($x$) direction. They record the position of the ruler's edge, $x_{\\text{pos}}$, and the corresponding power reading on the detector. They observe that the detector reading is constant for $x_{\\text{pos}}  -12.5$ mm, drops to zero for $x_{\\text{pos}} > 12.5$ mm, and decreases smoothly between these two positions.\n\nBased on these two experiments, determine the axial location of the instrument's entrance pupil relative to the input face, and the diameter of the entrance pupil. Express the location in cm and the diameter in mm. Round your final answers to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let the entrance pupil be a circular disk of radius $R$ centered on the optical axis and located at axial coordinate $z=z_e$ relative to the input face at $z=0$.\n\nExperiment 1 constrains the field of view. For a point source at $(x,-z_s)$ with $z_s>0$, the instrument transmits a non-zero signal if the chief ray from the source through the entrance pupil lies within the systemâ€™s field-limiting cone. A standard geometrical model is that the boundary of acceptance is a cone of fixed semi-angle $\\alpha$ whose apex is at the center of the entrance pupil. The source lies on the boundary when the line from the source to the apex makes angle $\\alpha$ with the axis. By right-triangle geometry,\n$$\n\\tan(\\alpha)=\\frac{x_{\\max}}{z_{e}+z_{s}}\n$$\nso $x_{\\max}(z_s) = \\tan(\\alpha) z_s + \\tan(\\alpha) z_e$.\nThis is a linear relation $x_{\\max} = a z_s + b$ with $a=\\tan(\\alpha)$ and $b=\\tan(\\alpha) z_e$. From the data, the slope is\n$a = \\frac{5.0-3.0}{20.0-10.0} = \\frac{2.0}{10.0} = 0.2$,\nand checking with other pairs confirms $a=0.2$. Using $z_s=10.0$ cm, $x_{\\max}=3.0$ cm gives\n$3.0 = 0.2 \\times 10.0 + b \\Rightarrow b=1.0$.\nHence\n$z_e = \\frac{b}{a} = \\frac{1.0}{0.2} = 5.0\\ \\text{cm}$.\n\nExperiment 2 determines the entrance pupil diameter. With a collimated on-axis beam, rays are parallel to the $z$-axis, so their transverse coordinate $x$ is the same at any plane, including at the entrance pupil plane $z=z_e$ and at the input face $z=0$. Sliding a knife-edge across the input face blocks a half-plane in $x$. The detector signal is constant until the edge reaches the left edge of the apparent pupil, then decreases smoothly as the edge scans across the circular pupil, and reaches zero once the edge passes the right edge. The reported transition from constant to zero occurs between $x_{\\text{pos}} = -12.5$ mm and $x_{\\text{pos}} = +12.5$ mm, so the entrance pupil radius is $R=12.5$ mm and the diameter is $D=2R=25.0$ mm.\n\nTherefore, the entrance pupil is located $5.00$ cm inside the instrument (positive $z$ from the input face), and its diameter is $25.0$ mm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}5.00  25.0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2218504"}]}
