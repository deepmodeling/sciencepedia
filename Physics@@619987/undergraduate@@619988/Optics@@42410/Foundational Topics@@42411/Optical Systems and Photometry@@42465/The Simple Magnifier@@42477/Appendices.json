The magnifier is intended for a user whose near point is at a distance of $N = 30.0$ cm from their eye.

To achieve the desired magnification, what is the required magnitude of the radius of curvature for the convex surface of the lens? Express your answer in centimeters (cm) and round it to three significant figures.", "solution": "The problem asks for the magnitude of the radius of curvature of a plano-convex lens designed to function as a simple magnifier with specific properties. We can solve this by combining the formula for angular magnification with the lensmaker's equation.\n\nFirst, let's determine the required focal length, $f$, of the lens. The angular magnification, $M$, of a simple magnifier for a relaxed eye (where the final image is at infinity) is given by the ratio of the user's near point distance, $N$, to the focal length of the lens, $f$.\n$$M = \\frac{N}{f}$$\nWe are given $M = 6.5$ and $N = 30.0$ cm. We can rearrange this equation to solve for the focal length $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{N}{M}$$\nSubstituting the given values, we find the required focal length:\n$$f = \\frac{30.0 \\text{ cm}}{6.5}$$\n\nNext, we relate the focal length of the lens to its physical properties using the lensmaker's equation. For a thin lens, this equation is:\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = \\left(\\frac{n_{\\text{lens}}}{n_{\\text{medium}}} - 1\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)$$\nHere, $n_{\\text{lens}}$ is the refractive index of the lens material, $n_{\\text{medium}}$ is the refractive index of the surrounding medium, and $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces.\n\nIn our case, the lens is made of a ceramic with $n_{\\text{lens}} = n = 1.75$ and is used in air, so $n_{\\text{medium}} = 1.00$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} - \\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)$$\nThe lens is plano-convex. This means one surface is planar (flat) and the other is convex. A planar surface has an infinite radius of curvature. Let's set the first surface to be planar, so $R_1 \\to \\infty$. The second surface is convex with a radius of curvature whose magnitude is $R$. According to the sign convention where light travels from left to right, if the second surface is convex (bulging towards the right), its center of curvature is to the left, so $R_2 = -R$. Substituting these into the lensmaker's equation gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\infty} - \\frac{1}{-R}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = (n - 1) \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{R}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{n - 1}{R}$$\nNote that if we had chosen the convex surface to be the first one ($R_1 = R$) and the planar surface to be the second one ($R_2 \\to \\infty$), the result for $\\frac{1}{f}$ would be the same. The equation relates the focal length to the magnitude of the radius of curvature of the convex surface, $R$.\n\nNow we have two expressions for $\\frac{1}{f}$. From the magnification formula, $\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{M}{N}$. From the lensmaker's equation, $\\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{n-1}{R}$. We can set these two expressions equal to each other:\n$$\\frac{M}{N} = \\frac{n - 1}{R}$$\nWe need to solve for the magnitude of the radius of curvature, $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{N(n - 1)}{M}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$N = 30.0$ cm\n$n = 1.75$\n$M = 6.5$\n\n$$R = \\frac{(30.0 \\text{ cm})(1.75 - 1.00)}{6.5}$$\n$$R = \\frac{(30.0 \\text{ cm})(0.75)}{6.5}$$\n$$R = \\frac{22.5 \\text{ cm}}{6.5}$$\n$$R \\approx 3.461538... \\text{ cm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 3.46 \\text{ cm}$$\nTherefore, the required magnitude of the radius of curvature for the convex surface of the lens is 3.46 cm.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.46}$$", "id": "2270159"}, {"introduction": "True understanding of a scientific principle involves knowing not only when it applies, but also when it does not. This final exercise [@problem_id:2270170] presents a conceptual challenge: why can't a diverging (concave) lens be used as a simple magnifier? Answering this question requires you to move beyond formulas and reason fundamentally about image formation and angular size to prove that magnification, defined as $M \\gt 1$, is impossible in this scenario.", "problem": "An optical engineering student is tasked with designing a simple magnifier. By mistake, they select a thin diverging (concave) lens instead of a converging lens. The diverging lens has a focal length of magnitude $F_0$. The student intends to view a small, real object of height $h_o$. The human eye can focus on objects and images located at any distance from the eye greater than or equal to the near point distance, $N$. Assume the student places their eye very close to the lens. The effectiveness of a magnifier is determined by its angular magnification, which is the ratio of the angular size of the image as seen through the lens to the maximum possible angular size of the object as seen by the naked eye.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental reason why this diverging lens setup fails to function as a magnifier for viewing a real object (i.e., why it cannot produce an angular magnification greater than 1)?\n\nA. The lens always produces a real, inverted image, which cannot be viewed by the eye in the same way as a magnifier.\n\nB. The lens produces a virtual image that is always located farther from the eye than the object is, which inherently makes it appear smaller.\n\nC. A magnified virtual image is only produced if the object is placed within the focal length, and for a diverging lens, this is physically impossible as the object distance must be positive.\n\nD. The maximum angular size of the virtual image, under the condition that the eye can actually focus on it, is always less than the maximum angular size of the object when viewed with the naked eye.\n\nE. To achieve any magnification, the object must be placed at a distance from the lens that is less than the near point distance $N$, but this always results in a real image located behind the observer's head.", "solution": "Let the thin lens have focal length $f=-F_{0}$ with $F_{0}>0$ (diverging lens).
