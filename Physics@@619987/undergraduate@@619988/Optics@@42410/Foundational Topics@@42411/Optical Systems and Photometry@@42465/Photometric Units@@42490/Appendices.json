The illuminance on a surface from a point source is given by the formula:\n$$E = \\frac{I \\cos(\\theta)}{r^2}$$\nwhere $I$ is the luminous intensity of the source, $r$ is the distance from the source to the point on the surface, and $\\theta$ is the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the light ray and the normal to the surface.\n\nLet the light source be at a height $h$ directly above the center of the circular table. The surface of the table is horizontal, so the normal to the surface is vertical. For any point on the table at a horizontal distance $x$ from the center, the distance $r$ from the source to this point can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$r^2 = h^2 + x^2 \\implies r = \\sqrt{h^2 + x^2}$$\nThe angle of incidence $\\theta$ is the angle between the vertical normal and the line connecting the source to the point.
