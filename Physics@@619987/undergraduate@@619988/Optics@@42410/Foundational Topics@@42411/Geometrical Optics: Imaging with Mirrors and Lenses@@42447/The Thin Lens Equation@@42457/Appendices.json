In many optical systems, light is manipulated by multiple lenses, and a converging beam of light destined for a focal point can be intercepted by another lens. This exercise [@problem_id:2271231] models such a setup, teaching you to treat the point of convergence as a virtual object with a negative object distance $s$. Mastering this concept is essential for analyzing compound optical instruments and deepens your understanding of the sign conventions in the thin lens equation.", "problem": "In an optical system designed for high-precision laser machining, a beam of light is first passed through a series of lenses that cause it to converge. Uninterrupted, these rays would focus to a sharp point at a location $P$. However, to adjust the focal characteristics, a thin diverging lens with a focal length of magnitude $F = 40.0 \\text{ cm}$ is placed in the path of this converging beam. The lens is positioned such that the point $P$ is located $24.0 \\text{ cm}$ beyond the lens, along the principal axis.\n\nYour task is to determine the new properties of the image formed by this diverging lens. Specifically, calculate the distance of the final image from the center of the diverging lens and its lateral magnification.\n\nProvide the image distance in cm, and the lateral magnification as a dimensionless number. Both values should be rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "Interpret the converging bundle using the Gaussian sign convention for thin lenses. A diverging lens has focal length $f<0$. The incoming rays would converge to a point $P$ located a distance $24.0$ cm to the right of the lens if the lens were absent; this is equivalent to a virtual object at distance $s_o=-24.0$ cm (object on the image side). The diverging lens has focal length of magnitude $40.0$ cm, so $f=-40.0$ cm.

Here, an object oscillates along the principal axis, and we investigate the resulting motion of its image. This scenario [@problem_id:2271263] introduces the concept of longitudinal magnification, which relates the axial displacement of the image to that of the object. By applying a small-amplitude approximation, you will see how calculus can be a powerful tool to linearize the thin lens equation and determine the amplitude of the image's motion, revealing a more nuanced aspect of image formation.", "problem": "In an experimental setup for non-contact surface characterization, a small reflective target is positioned on the principal axis of a thin converging lens.
