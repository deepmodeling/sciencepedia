By analyzing this setup, you will see how collimated light is produced and then handled by a second lens, a key principle in the design of telescopes and beam expanders.", "problem": "Consider a compound lens system used in a simplified model of a Galilean telescope eyepiece. The system consists of two thin lenses aligned on a common optical axis. The first lens, the objective, is a converging lens with a positive focal length of $f_1$. The second lens, the eyepiece, is a diverging lens with a negative focal length of $f_2$. The two lenses are separated by a distance $d$. An object is placed on the axis at a distance $f_1$ in front of the objective lens (i.e., at its front focal point).\n\nFind a symbolic expression for the distance of the final image formed by the two-lens system, as measured from the second (diverging) lens. Use the standard sign convention where the object distance is positive for an object on the side of the lens from which light is coming, and the image distance is positive for a real image formed on the side of the lens to which light is going.", "solution": "Use the thin lens equation for each lens with the stated sign convention:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s}+\\frac{1}{s'}=\\frac{1}{f}.\n$$\nFor the first (objective) lens, the object is placed at its front focal point, so $s_{1}=f_{1}$.

This next practice [@problem_id:2223066] introduces the important and sometimes counter-intuitive concept of a virtual object. Here, you will analyze a scenario where a converging beam of light is intercepted by a diverging lens, helping to solidify your grasp of sign conventions and revealing how a diverging lens can form a real image.", "problem": "A beam of light, initially traveling parallel to a principal axis, is incident on a large ideal converging lens (not shown in the region of interest). The beam is focused and continues on a path to converge at a point P. Before the light reaches point P, a thin ideal diverging lens is placed in its path, with its principal axis aligned with that of the converging beam. The focal length of this diverging lens is -30.0 cm. The lens is positioned such that the point P is located 20.0 cm beyond the diverging lens. The light passes through the diverging lens and forms a final, real image at a point Q.\n\nCalculate the distance of the final image Q from the diverging lens, and the transverse magnification of the image formed by the diverging lens. Your answer should be a set of two numbers: the image distance first, followed by the magnification. Express the image distance in cm and round both numerical answers to three significant figures.", "solution": "This problem can be solved using the thin lens equation and the formula for transverse magnification. We must first correctly identify the object distance, image distance, and focal length according to a consistent sign convention.\n\nLet's adopt the following standard sign convention for a thin lens:\n1.  Light is assumed to travel from left to right.\n2.  The position of the lens is the origin ($x=0$).\n3.  The object distance, $s$, is positive if the object is on the side from which the light is coming (a real object, to the left of the lens) and negative if it is on the opposite side (a virtual object, to the right of the lens).\n4.  The image distance, $s'$, is positive if the image is on the side to which the light is going (a real image, to the right of the lens) and negative if it is on the opposite side (a virtual image, to the left of the lens).\n5.  The focal length, $f$, is positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens.\n\nIn this problem, we are given a diverging lens, so its focal length is negative:\n$f = -30.0$ cm.\n\nThe incoming beam of light is converging to a point P located 20.0 cm *beyond* the lens. This means that if the diverging lens were not present, the light would have focused at this point. For the diverging lens, this point P acts as the object. Since P is on the right side of the lens (the side to which the light is traveling), it is a virtual object. According to our sign convention, the object distance $s$ is negative.\n$s = -20.0$ cm.\n\nNow we can use the thin lens equation to find the position of the final image, $s'$. The thin lens equation is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s} + \\frac{1}{s'} = \\frac{1}{f} $$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the image distance $s'$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s'} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{s} $$\n\nSubstitute the given values for $f$ and $s$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s'} = \\frac{1}{-30.0 \\text{ cm}} - \\frac{1}{-20.0 \\text{ cm}} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{s'} = -\\frac{1}{30.0} + \\frac{1}{20.0} $$\n\nTo combine the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 60.0:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s'} = -\\frac{2}{60.0} + \\frac{3}{60.0} $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{s'} = \\frac{1}{60.0 \\text{ cm}} $$\n\nSolving for $s'$ by taking the reciprocal:\n$$ s' = 60.0 \\text{ cm} $$\n\nSince the image distance $s'$ is positive, the image is real and is located 60.0 cm to the right of the diverging lens. This is the first part of our answer.\n\nNext, we calculate the transverse magnification, $M$. The formula for magnification is:\n$$ M = -\\frac{s'}{s} $$\n\nSubstitute the values we have for $s'$ and $s$:\n$$ M = -\\frac{60.0 \\text{ cm}}{-20.0 \\text{ cm}} $$\n$$ M = -(-3.00) $$\n$$ M = 3.00 $$\n\nThe magnification is a dimensionless quantity. The positive sign indicates that the image is upright relative to the object. A magnification with a magnitude greater than 1 means the image is enlarged. Both calculated values, $s'=60.0$ cm and $M=3.00$, are already at the required three significant figures.\n\nThe final answer consists of the image distance (in cm) and the magnification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 60.0  3.00 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2223066"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply calculating the final image position, the real power of optical principles lies in designing systems that achieve specific goals.
