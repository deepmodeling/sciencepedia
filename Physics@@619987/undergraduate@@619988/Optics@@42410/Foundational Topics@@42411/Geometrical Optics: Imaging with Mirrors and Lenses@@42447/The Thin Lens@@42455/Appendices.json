By manipulating the thin lens equation, you'll uncover a surprising and elegant relationship that governs the physical layout of all simple imaging systems, providing deep insight into why a real image cannot be formed arbitrarily close to a real object.", "problem": "An optical engineer is designing a compact imaging system consisting of a single thin converging lens with a positive focal length $f$. The system is intended to project a real image of a real object onto a screen. To minimize the overall size of the setup, the engineer needs to determine the absolute minimum distance that can be established between the object and the screen. Assuming the lens can be positioned at any point along the line connecting the object and the screen, derive an expression for this minimum possible distance in terms of the focal length $f$.", "solution": "Let $p$ be the distance from the object to the lens and $q$ be the distance from the lens to the image. For a real object and a real image, both $p$ and $q$ must be positive, i.e., $p > 0$ and $q > 0$. The lens is a converging lens, so its focal length $f$ is also positive.\n\nThe relationship between the object distance, image distance, and focal length is given by the thin lens equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\nThe total distance, $D$, between the object and the real image (the screen) is the sum of the object distance and the image distance:\n$$\nD = p + q\n$$\nOur goal is to find the minimum possible value of $D$.\n\nWe can express the thin lens equation in terms of $D$ and one of the distances, say $p$. Since $q = D - p$, we can substitute this into the lens equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{D-p} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\nFor a real image to be formed, $q$ must be positive, so $D-p > 0$, which implies $p < D$.\n\nNow, let's rearrange the equation to solve for $D$.\n$$\n\\frac{(D-p) + p}{p(D-p)} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{D}{p(D-p)} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\n$$\nfD = p(D-p) = pD - p^2\n$$\nThis can be written as a quadratic equation in $p$:\n$$\np^2 - Dp + fD = 0\n$$\nFor a physical solution to exist, the object distance $p$ must be a real number. This means that the quadratic equation for $p$ must have real roots. The condition for real roots is that the discriminant, $\\Delta$, must be non-negative ($\\Delta \\ge 0$).\n\nThe discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. In our case, $a=1$, $b=-D$, and $c=fD$.\n$$\n\\Delta = (-D)^2 - 4(1)(fD) \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\nD^2 - 4fD \\ge 0\n$$\nSince $D = p+q$ and both $p$ and $q$ are positive, $D$ must be a positive quantity ($D > 0$). We can therefore divide the inequality by $D$ without changing its direction:\n$$\nD - 4f \\ge 0\n$$\nThis leads to the final condition:\n$$\nD \\ge 4f\n$$\nThe inequality shows that the distance $D$ between the object and its real image must be greater than or equal to $4f$. Therefore, the minimum possible distance is $4f$.\n\nThis minimum occurs when the discriminant is zero, $\\Delta = 0$, which corresponds to a single real root for $p$. The root of the quadratic equation is $p = \\frac{-b}{2a} = \\frac{D}{2}$. At the minimum distance, $D = 4f$, so the object distance is $p = \\frac{4f}{2} = 2f$. The corresponding image distance is $q = D - p = 4f - 2f = 2f$. This symmetric configuration ($p=q=2f$) corresponds to an imaging system with a magnification of $M = -q/p = -1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4f}$$", "id": "2271021"}, {"introduction": "Having established a key limitation for real images, we now broaden our scope to include virtual images and different types of lenses.
