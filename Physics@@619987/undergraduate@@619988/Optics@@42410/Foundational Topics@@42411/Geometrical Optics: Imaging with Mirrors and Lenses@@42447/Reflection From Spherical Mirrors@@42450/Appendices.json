The student measures the magnification for this setup and finds it to be exactly $m_1 = -0.500$.\n\nNext, the student moves the LED a distance of $d = 10.0$ cm from its initial position, bringing it closer to the mirror. After adjusting the screen, a new sharp, real, and inverted image is formed.

From the magnification formula, $s_{i1} = -m_1 s_{o1} = 0.500 s_{o1}$. Substituting into the mirror equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{f} = \\frac{1}{s_{o1}} + \\frac{1}{s_{i1}} = \\frac{1}{s_{o1}} + \\frac{1}{0.500 s_{o1}} = \\frac{1}{s_{o1}} + \\frac{2}{s_{o1}} = \\frac{3}{s_{o1}} $$\nThis gives us a relationship: $s_{o1} = 3f$.\n\nFor the second measurement, the object is moved closer by $d=10.0$ cm, so the new object distance is $s_{o2} = s_{o1} - d$. The new magnification is $m_2 = -0.750$.\nThis means $s_{i2} = -m_2 s_{o2} = 0.750 s_{o2}$.

The goal is to form a sharp, real image of a small object (an LED) onto a screen. Both the object and screen are located on the principal axis. What is the minimum possible physical distance between the object and its real image? Express your answer in terms of the focal length $f$.", "solution": "Let $s_o$ be the object distance and $s_i$ be the image distance. For a real object and a real image formed by a single concave mirror, both $s_o$ and $s_i$ must be positive. This also means both the object and the image are on the same side of the mirror (the front side). The mirror equation is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{s_o} + \\frac{1}{s_i} = \\frac{1}{f} $$\nFor a real image to be formed, the object must be placed outside the focal point, i.e., $s_o > f$.\n\nThe physical distance $L$ between the object and the image is the absolute difference of their distances from the mirror's vertex:\n$$ L = |s_o - s_i| $$\nWe want to find the minimum value of $L$. From the mirror equation, we can express $s_i$ in terms of $s_o$:\n$$ s_i = \\frac{s_o f}{s_o - f} $$\nThe distance $L$ is a function of $s_o$:\n$$ L(s_o) = \\left| s_o - \\frac{s_o f}{s_o - f} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{s_o(s_o - f) - s_o f}{s_o - f} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{s_o^2 - 2s_o f}{s_o - f} \\right| $$\nThe minimum value of an absolute value function is 0, provided its argument can be 0. Let's check if the argument can be zero for a valid physical situation (where $s_o > f$). The argument is zero when its numerator is zero:\n$$ s_o^2 - 2s_o f = s_o(s_o - 2f) = 0 $$\nThis gives two possible solutions for $s_o$: $s_o = 0$ (which is not a valid object distance for forming a real image) and $s_o = 2f$.\n\nThe solution $s_o = 2f$ is physically valid, as $2f > f$ (since $f>0$). When the object is placed at the center of curvature ($s_o = 2f = R$), the mirror equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2f} + \\frac{1}{s_i} = \\frac{1}{f} \\implies \\frac{1}{s_i} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{1}{2f} = \\frac{1}{2f} $$\nSo, the image is also formed at the center of curvature, $s_i = 2f$.\n\nIn this case, the distance between the object and image is:\n$$ L = |s_o - s_i| = |2f - 2f| = 0 $$\nSince distance $L$ cannot be negative, its minimum possible value is 0. This occurs when the object is placed at the center of curvature of the mirror, and the image is formed at the exact same location.
