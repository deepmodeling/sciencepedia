The mirror has a positive focal length, denoted by $f$. To achieve the desired magnification, they position a small blemish on their face at a distance from the mirror's surface that is exactly half of the mirror's focal length. Using the convention that distances are measured along the principal axis from the center of the mirror, with positive distances corresponding to the side of the mirror where light originates (the front), find the position of the image of the blemish, $d_i$.
