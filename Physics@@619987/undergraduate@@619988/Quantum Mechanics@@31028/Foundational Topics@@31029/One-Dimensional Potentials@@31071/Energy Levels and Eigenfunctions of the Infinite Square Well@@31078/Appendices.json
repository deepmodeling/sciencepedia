The energy grows in proportion to $n^2$, meaning the gaps between consecutive levels increase as the energy quantum number $n$ rises. This exercise provides a direct way to quantify this effect by comparing an energy gap higher up in the spectrum to the fundamental energy of the ground state [@problem_id:2091041].
