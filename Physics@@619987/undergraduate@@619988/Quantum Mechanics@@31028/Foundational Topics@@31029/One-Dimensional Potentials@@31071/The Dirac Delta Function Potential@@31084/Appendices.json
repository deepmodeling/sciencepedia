It experiences a highly localized attractive potential centered at the origin, which is accurately modeled by the Dirac delta potential $V(x) = -\\alpha \\delta(x)$. Here, $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the potential's strength, and $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function. This potential supports exactly one bound state (a state with energy $E0$).
