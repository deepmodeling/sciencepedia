Extending this model to three dimensions allows us to explore how a particle's energy levels are affected by the geometry of its container. This practice focuses on calculating the energy spectrum and understanding the concept of degeneracy, which occurs when different quantum states share the same energy, often due to underlying symmetries in the system [@problem_id:2112855].", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a semiconductor quantum dot, which can be treated as an electron of mass $m_e$ confined within a three-dimensional rectangular box with impenetrable walls. The potential energy is zero inside the box and infinite outside. The dimensions of the box are given by $L_x = 2a$, $L_y = 2a$, and $L_z = a$, where $a$ is a characteristic length.
