The Hamiltonian is given by $H = -\\gamma \\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{B}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the spin operator.\nSubstituting the magnetic field, we get:\n$$H = -\\gamma (S_x \\hat{i} + S_y \\hat{j} + S_z \\hat{k}) \\cdot (B_0 \\hat{i}) = -\\gamma B_0 S_x$$\nThe Hamiltonian is proportional to the spin operator in the x-direction.\n\nStep 2: Use the time evolution of expectation values.\nThe time evolution of the expectation value of an operator $A$ (that does not explicitly depend on time) is given by Ehrenfest's theorem:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\langle [H, A] \\rangle$$\nWe are given that $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ is constant in time, which means $\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle S_z \\rangle = 0$.\n\nStep 3: Apply Ehrenfest's theorem to $S_z$.\nLet's compute the commutator $[H, S_z]$:\n$$[H, S_z] = [-\\gamma B_0 S_x, S_z] = -\\gamma B_0 [S_x, S_z]$$\nThe fundamental commutation relation for spin operators is $[S_i, S_j] = i\\hbar \\epsilon_{ijk} S_k$. For our case, this gives $[S_x, S_z] = i\\hbar \\epsilon_{xyz} S_y = i\\hbar (-1) S_y = -i\\hbar S_y$.\nSubstituting this into the commutator expression:\n$$[H, S_z] = -\\gamma B_0 (-i\\hbar S_y) = i\\hbar \\gamma B_0 S_y$$\nNow, substitute this into the Ehrenfest equation for $S_z$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\langle [H, S_z] \\rangle = \\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\langle i\\hbar \\gamma B_0 S_y \\rangle = -\\gamma B_0 \\langle S_y \\rangle$$\n\nStep 4: Analyze the consequences of the given information.\nWe are given $\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle S_z \\rangle = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$. From the result in Step 3, this immediately implies:\n$$-\\gamma B_0 \\langle S_y \\rangle(t) = 0$$\nSince $\\gamma$ and $B_0$ are non-zero constants, we must have $\\langle S_y \\rangle(t) = 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nStep 5: Investigate the implications of $\\langle S_y \\rangle(t) = 0$.\nIf $\\langle S_y \\rangle(t)$ is identically zero for all time, its time derivative must also be zero. Let's compute this derivative using Ehrenfest's theorem for $A = S_y$.\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\langle [H, S_y] \\rangle$$\nFirst, the commutator:\n$$[H, S_y] = [-\\gamma B_0 S_x, S_y] = -\\gamma B_0 [S_x, S_y]$$\nThe commutation relation is $[S_x, S_y] = i\\hbar S_z$.\n$$[H, S_y] = -\\gamma B_0 (i\\hbar S_z) = -i\\hbar \\gamma B_0 S_z$$\nSubstituting into the Ehrenfest equation for $S_y$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\langle S_y \\rangle = \\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\langle -i\\hbar \\gamma B_0 S_z \\rangle = \\gamma B_0 \\langle S_z \\rangle$$\nSince we know $\\langle S_y \\rangle(t) = 0$, its derivative must be zero.

So, the constant value of $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ must be zero.\n\nStep 6: Characterize the initial state.\nFrom the analysis above, the experimental observation forces two conditions on the expectation values of the spin components at any time $t$, including the initial time $t=0$:\n1. $\\langle S_y \\rangle_0 = \\langle S_y \\rangle(0) = 0$\n2. $\\langle S_z \\rangle_0 = \\langle S_z \\rangle(0) = 0$\n(The subscript 0 denotes the expectation value in the initial state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle$).\n\nThis means that the initial expectation value of the spin vector, $\\langle \\vec{S} \\rangle_0$, must have its y and z components equal to zero. Thus, it can only have an x-component:\n$$\\langle \\vec{S} \\rangle_0 = \\langle S_x \\rangle_0 \\hat{i}$$\nThe problem states that $|\\psi(0)\\rangle$ is a pure spin-1/2 state. For any pure spin-1/2 state, the magnitude of the expectation value of the spin vector is always maximal and equal to $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n$$|\\langle \\vec{S} \\rangle_0| = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$$\nIn our case, this means:\n$$|\\langle S_x \\rangle_0 \\hat{i}| = |\\langle S_x \\rangle_0| = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$$\nSo, we must have $\\langle S_x \\rangle_0 = \\pm \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\nA fundamental property of spin-1/2 systems is that if a pure state has a spin expectation value of magnitude $\\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ along a certain direction $\\hat{n}$, then that state must be an eigenstate of the corresponding spin operator $S_n = \\vec{S} \\cdot \\hat{n}$.\nIn our case, since $\\langle S_x \\rangle_0 = \\pm \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, the initial state $|\\psi(0)\\rangle$ must be an eigenstate of the operator $S_x$.\n\nStep 7: Check the options.\nA. The initial state must be an eigenstate of the operator $S_x$. This matches our conclusion.\nB. An eigenstate of $S_y$ would have $\\langle S_y \\rangle_0 = \\pm \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, which contradicts our finding that $\\langle S_y \\rangle_0 = 0$.\nC. An eigenstate of $S_z$ would have $\\langle S_z \\rangle_0 = \\pm \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, which contradicts our finding that $\\langle S_z \\rangle_0 = 0$.\nD. This option corresponds to states where the magnitudes of the coefficients for spin-up and spin-down are equal, which ensures $\\langle S_z \\rangle_0 = 0$. However, it allows an arbitrary relative phase. For $\\langle S_y \\rangle_0$ to also be zero, the relative phase must be 0 or $\\pi$, which corresponds to the eigenstates of $S_x$. Thus, this option is too general and incorrect.\nE. We have clearly shown that the observation imposes a strong constraint, so this is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only correct and complete conclusion is that the initial state must be an eigenstate of $S_x$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2122619"}, {"introduction": "Quantum dynamics is characterized by both smooth, unitary evolution and the abrupt changes caused by measurement.
