It dictates that no two electrons can share the same quantum state, thereby organizing electrons into distinct shells and subshells. This first exercise is a foundational practice in applying the rules of quantum numbers ($n$, $l$, $m_l$, $m_s$) to determine the maximum electron capacity of a principal energy shell, a key skill for building the periodic table from first principles.

This thought experiment challenges you to determine the ground-state configuration of an atom built from bosonic particles, which, unlike fermions, are happy to crowd into the lowest possible energy state.
