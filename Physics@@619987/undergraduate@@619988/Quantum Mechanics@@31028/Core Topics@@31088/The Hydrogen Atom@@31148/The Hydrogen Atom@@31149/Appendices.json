The Coulomb potential $V(r) = -e^2/(4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r)$ is spherically symmetric. This forces the probability density $|\\psi_{nlm}(\\vec{r})|^2$ to also be spherically symmetric. The expectation value is then the integral of an odd function (the vector components of $\\vec{r}$) over a symmetric domain, which must be zero.\n\nB. The stationary states are, by definition, states whose properties do not evolve in time. Therefore, the expectation value $\\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle$ must be a constant vector. The only vector that is not arbitrary and is consistent with the symmetries of the Hamiltonian is the zero vector.\n\nC. The Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom commutes with the parity operator, $\\hat{\\Pi}$, which inverts the coordinates $(\\vec{r} \\rightarrow -\\vec{r})$. Consequently, the stationary states $\\psi_{nlm}(\\vec{r})$ are eigenstates of parity. Because the position operator $\\vec{r}$ is an odd operator under parity, its expectation value in any parity eigenstate must be zero.\n\nD. According to Ehrenfest's theorem, $\\frac{d\\langle \\vec{r} \\rangle}{dt} = \\frac{\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle}{m_e}$. Since a stationary state does not evolve in time, $\\frac{d\\langle \\vec{r} \\rangle}{dt} = 0$, implying that the expectation value of momentum $\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle$ must be zero. For the average momentum to be zero, the particle must, on average, be located at the origin.\n\nE. The position operator $\\vec{r}$ does not commute with the Hamiltonian $H$. In quantum mechanics, the expectation value of any observable that does not commute with the Hamiltonian must be zero for an energy eigenstate.", "solution": "This problem asks for the most accurate physical reasoning to explain why the expectation value of the position operator, $\\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle$, is zero for any stationary state of the hydrogen atom, without performing an explicit integration.

We need to show this integral is the zero vector.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n\n**A. Incorrect.** The premise that the probability density $|\\psi_{nlm}(\\vec{r})|^2$ is spherically symmetric is false for most states. The wavefunction is $\\psi_{nlm}(\\vec{r}) = R_{nl}(r)Y_{lm}(\\theta, \\phi)$. The probability density is $|\\psi_{nlm}|^2 = |R_{nl}(r)|^2 |Y_{lm}(\\theta, \\phi)|^2$. The spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}(\\theta, \\phi)$ are not spherically symmetric for any state with $l > 0$. For instance, the $p$-orbitals ($l=1$) and $d$-orbitals ($l=2$) have distinct directional lobes. Only for $l=0$ (s-orbitals) is the angular part constant and the probability density spherically symmetric. The conclusion is correct for s-orbitals based on this reasoning, but the reasoning fails for all other orbitals ($p, d, f, ...$), while the result $\\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle = 0$ holds for all of them.\n\n**B. Incorrect.** This is a plausible but not rigorous argument. It is true that for a stationary state, $\\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle$ must be constant in time. The argument then appeals to an intuitive notion of symmetry (\"the only special vector is zero\"). However, this is not a formal proof. One could imagine a system (e.g., an atom in a uniform external electric field) where the potential is not spherically symmetric, and the stationary states have a non-zero, constant expectation value for position (a permanent electric dipole moment). This option does not use a specific property of the hydrogen atom's Hamiltonian or its eigenstates to rigorously derive the result.\n\n**C. Correct.** This option provides the most rigorous and general argument based on symmetry.\n1. The Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom, $H = \\frac{\\vec{p}^2}{2m_e} - \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}$, is invariant under the parity transformation $\\vec{r} \\rightarrow -\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{p} \\rightarrow -\\vec{p}$. This means the Hamiltonian commutes with the parity operator, $[H, \\hat{\\Pi}] = 0$.\n2. Because they commute, $H$ and $\\hat{\\Pi}$ share a common set of eigenstates. The stationary states $\\psi_{nlm}(\\vec{r})$ are eigenstates of $H$, so they must also be eigenstates of $\\hat{\\Pi}$.\n3. The action of the parity operator on a wavefunction is $\\hat{\\Pi} \\psi(\\vec{r}) = \\psi(-\\vec{r})$. The wavefunctions for the hydrogen atom are known to have a definite parity determined by the azimuthal quantum number $l$: $\\hat{\\Pi}\\psi_{nlm}(\\vec{r}) = \\psi_{nlm}(-\\vec{r}) = (-1)^l \\psi_{nlm}(\\vec{r})$.\n4. Now, let's examine the expectation value $\\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle = \\langle\\psi_{nlm}|\\vec{r}|\\psi_{nlm}\\rangle$. We can insert the identity operator $\\hat{I} = \\hat{\\Pi}^{-1}\\hat{\\Pi}$ into the expression:\n$$ \\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle = \\langle\\psi_{nlm}|\\hat{\\Pi}^{-1}\\hat{\\Pi} \\, \\vec{r} \\, \\hat{\\Pi}^{-1}\\hat{\\Pi}|\\psi_{nlm}\\rangle $$\nGroup the terms as:\n$$ \\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle = \\langle\\hat{\\Pi}\\psi_{nlm}| (\\hat{\\Pi} \\, \\vec{r} \\, \\hat{\\Pi}^{-1}) |\\hat{\\Pi}\\psi_{nlm}\\rangle $$\nThe position operator is odd under parity: $\\hat{\\Pi} \\, \\vec{r} \\, \\hat{\\Pi}^{-1} = -\\vec{r}$. Also, since $\\psi_{nlm}$ is a parity eigenstate, $\\hat{\\Pi}|\\psi_{nlm}\\rangle = (-1)^l |\\psi_{nlm}\\rangle$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$ \\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle = \\langle(-1)^l\\psi_{nlm}| (-\\vec{r}) |(-1)^l\\psi_{nlm}\\rangle $$\n$$ \\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle = (-1)^l (-1) (-1)^l \\langle\\psi_{nlm}|\\vec{r}|\\psi_{nlm}\\rangle = (-1)^{2l} (-1) \\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle $$\nSince $(-1)^{2l} = 1$ for any integer $l$, we get:\n$$ \\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle = - \\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle $$\nThe only vector that is equal to its own negative is the zero vector. Therefore, $\\langle\\vec{r}\\rangle = \\vec{0}$. This argument is rigorous and applies to all stationary states $\\psi_{nlm}$.\n\n**D. Incorrect.** This argument contains a logical flaw. For a stationary state (an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian), the expectation value of any operator $A$ that does not explicitly depend on time is constant. Thus, $\\frac{d\\langle \\vec{r} \\rangle}{dt} = 0$. Ehrenfest's theorem, $\\frac{d\\langle \\vec{r} \\rangle}{dt} = \\frac{\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle}{m_e}$, then correctly implies that $\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle = \\vec{0}$. It is true that the average momentum is zero for a bound state. However, the statement that $\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle = \\vec{0}$ implies $\\langle \\vec{r} \\rangle = \\vec{0}$ is a non-sequitur. A particle can have zero average momentum while being, on average, located away from the origin (e.g., a classical particle oscillating symmetrically about a point $x_0 \\neq 0$). Ehrenfest's theorem only connects the rate of change of $\\langle \\vec{r} \\rangle$ to $\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle$, it does not determine the value of $\\langle \\vec{r} \\rangle$ itself.\n\n**E. Incorrect.** This statement is fundamentally wrong. An operator not commuting with the Hamiltonian means its corresponding observable is not a conserved quantity. It does not mean its expectation value must be zero. For example, the kinetic energy operator $T = \\vec{p}^2/(2m_e)$ does not commute with the Hamiltonian $H$, but its expectation value $\\langle T \\rangle$ is certainly not zero for any bound state. Similarly, the potential energy operator $V(r)$ does not commute with $H$, but $\\langle V \\rangle$ is not zero. The premise is false.\n\nTherefore, the only correct and rigorous justification among the choices is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2133462"}, {"introduction": "While the hydrogen atom is a rare case with an exact analytical solution, most problems in quantum mechanics require numerical methods.

It represents a standard exercise in computational quantum mechanics.\n\nThe starting point is the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) for a single electron in the central Coulomb potential of a proton. In atomic units, where the reduced mass of the electron-proton system is approximated by the electron mass $m_e=1$, and other constants are $\\hbar=1$, $e=1$, $4\\pi\\varepsilon_0=1$, the TISE is given by:\n$$\n\\left( -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\Psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere $V(r) = -1/r$ is the Coulomb potential. Given the spherical symmetry of the potential, we seek solutions in spherical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ by separating variables. The wavefunction is written as $\\Psi(r, \\theta, \\phi) = R_{\\ell}(r) Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta, \\phi)$, where $Y_{\\ell m}$ are the spherical harmonics, eigenfunctions of the angular momentum operator. This separation leads to the radial Schrödinger equation for the radial part of the wavefunction $R_{\\ell}(r)$. It is numerically advantageous to work with the reduced radial function, defined as $u_\\ell(r) = r R_\\ell(r)$. Substituting this into the radial equation yields the effective one-dimensional eigenvalue problem for $u_\\ell(r)$:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} + V_{\\text{eff}}(r) \\right] u_\\ell(r) = E u_\\ell(r)\n$$\nwhere the effective potential is $V_{\\text{eff}}(r) = \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2r^2} - \\frac{1}{r}$. The term $\\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2r^2}$ is the centrifugal potential barrier, with $\\ell$ being the angular momentum quantum number.\n\nThe problem requires a solution on the half-line $r \\in [0, \\infty)$. Physical boundary conditions must be imposed. First, the full wavefunction $\\Psi$ must be finite everywhere, including the origin $r=0$. Since $R_\\ell(r) = u_\\ell(r)/r$, for $R_\\ell(r)$ to be finite as $r \\to 0$, we must have $u_\\ell(0) = 0$. Second, for a bound state solution, the wavefunction must be normalizable, which means $\\int |\\Psi|^2 dV < \\infty$. This implies that the wavefunction must vanish at infinity, leading to the condition $u_\\ell(r) \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe problem specializes to the $s$-wave sector, which corresponds to the lowest angular momentum state with $\\ell=0$. In this case, the centrifugal term vanishes, and the radial equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^2}{dr^2} - \\frac{1}{r} \\right] u_0(r) = E u_0(r)\n$$\nTo solve this numerically, we must work on a finite domain. We replace the infinite interval $[0, \\infty)$ with a finite one $[0, R_{\\max}]$. The boundary condition at infinity is approximated by imposing $u_0(R_{\\max}) = 0$. This is a consistent approximation because for bound states, the wavefunction decays exponentially. For the ground state of hydrogen, $u_0(r)$ is proportional to $r e^{-r}$. If $R_{\\max}$ is chosen sufficiently large, the true wavefunction at $r=R_{\\max}$ is already negligible. For the specified $R_{\\max}=30$ Bohr radii, the value of the true ground state wavefunction is exceedingly small, on the order of $10^{-12}$, justifying the approximation $u_0(30) \\approx 0$.\n\nWe now discretize the differential equation on the interval $[0, R_{\\max}]$ using a uniform grid of $N$ points. The grid points are $r_j = j \\Delta r$ for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, with grid spacing $\\Delta r = R_{\\max} / (N-1)$. The function $u_0(r)$ is represented by its values at these points, $u_j = u_0(r_j)$. The boundary conditions fix $u_0=0$ and $u_{N-1}=0$. The remaining $N-2$ values, $u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{N-2}$, are the unknowns. The second derivative operator is approximated using a second-order central difference formula at each interior grid point $r_j$ ($j=1, \\dots, N-2$):\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 u_0}{dr^2} \\bigg|_{r=r_j} \\approx \\frac{u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1}}{(\\Delta r)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the $s$-wave radial equation gives a system of linear equations:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{u_{j+1} - 2u_j + u_{j-1}}{(\\Delta r)^2} \\right) - \\frac{1}{r_j} u_j = E u_j, \\quad \\text{for } j=1, \\dots, N-2.\n$$\nRearranging the terms to fit the standard eigenvalue problem form $H \\mathbf{u} = E \\mathbf{u}$:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2(\\Delta r)^2} \\right] u_{j-1} + \\left[ \\frac{1}{(\\Delta r)^2} - \\frac{1}{r_j} \\right] u_j + \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2(\\Delta r)^2} \\right] u_{j+1} = E u_j\n$$\nThis defines an $(N-2) \\times (N-2)$ matrix eigenvalue problem, where the vector of unknowns is $\\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{N-2})^T$. The Hamiltonian matrix $H$ is real, symmetric, and tridiagonal. Its elements are:\n-   Diagonal elements: $H_{k,k} = \\frac{1}{(\\Delta r)^2} - \\frac{1}{r_{k+1}}$ for $k=0, \\dots, N-3$.\n-   Off-diagonal elements: $H_{k, k+1} = H_{k+1, k} = -\\frac{1}{2(\\Delta r)^2}$ for $k=0, \\dots, N-4$.\nHere, the matrix indices $k$ run from $0$ to $N-3$, corresponding to grid indices $j=k+1$ which run from $1$ to $N-2$.\n\nThe task is to find the smallest eigenvalue of this matrix $H$, which approximates the ground state energy $E_0$. Since the matrix is tridiagonal and Hermitian (real symmetric), highly efficient numerical algorithms exist. We will use a specialized solver designed for such matrices, which is significantly faster than general-purpose eigensolvers. The error of the finite difference approximation is of order $O((\\Delta r)^2)$, so we expect the error in the computed eigenvalue to also converge as $O((\\Delta r)^2)$. This implies that doubling the number of grid points $N$ (roughly halving $\\Delta r$) should reduce the absolute error by a factor of approximately $4$.
