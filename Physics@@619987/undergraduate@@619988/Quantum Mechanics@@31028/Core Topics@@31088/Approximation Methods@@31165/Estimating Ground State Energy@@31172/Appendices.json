This powerful method allows us to find an upper bound for the ground state energy of a quantum system by testing various \"trial\" wavefunctions. The central rule, which is the focus of this exercise [@problem_id:2081032], is that the optimization must apply to parameters within the trial wavefunction, not to the physical parameters within the Hamiltonian that defines the actual system under study. This conceptual check solidifies the correct application of the principle.", "problem": "In quantum mechanics, the variational principle provides a powerful method for approximating the ground state energy, $E_{gs}$, of a physical system. For a system described by a specific Hamiltonian, $H$, the principle states that for any well-behaved trial wavefunction, $\\Psi$, the expectation value of the energy, $E_{trial} = \\frac{\\langle \\Psi | H | \\Psi \\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi | \\Psi \\rangle}$, is always greater than or equal to the true ground state energy, i.e., $E_{trial} \\ge E_{gs}$.\n\nConsider the Helium atom, which consists of a nucleus with charge $Z=2$ and two electrons. The Hamiltonian for this system is fixed and given by:\n$$H_{\\text{He}} = \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\nabla_1^2 - \\frac{2e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_1}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}\\nabla_2^2 - \\frac{2e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_2}\\right) + \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 |\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|}$$\nA standard variational approach involves choosing a trial wavefunction with an adjustable parameter, such as an effective nuclear charge $Z_{eff}$, and then minimizing the expectation value of $H_{\\text{He}}$ with respect to $Z_{eff}$ to find the best upper-bound estimate for Helium's ground state energy.\n\nA student proposes a conceptually different procedure. They suggest considering a general Hamiltonian $H(Z)$ for a Helium-like atom with a variable nuclear charge $Z$. Their proposed method is as follows:\n1. Define the Hamiltonian $H(Z)$ for a general two-electron atom with nuclear charge $Z$.\n2. Determine the exact ground state energy, $E_{gs}(Z)$, as a function of the nuclear charge $Z$.\n3. Find the value of $Z$ that minimizes this energy function by solving the equation $\\frac{dE_{gs}(Z)}{dZ} = 0$.\n4. The student claims that the resulting minimum energy, $\\min_Z[E_{gs}(Z)]$, is a valid approximation for the ground state energy of the actual Helium atom.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most fundamental reason why the student's proposed method is physically and mathematically incorrect for its stated purpose of approximating the ground state energy of Helium?\n\nA. The procedure is incorrect because the exact ground state energy function $E_{gs}(Z)$ for a two-electron atom cannot be determined analytically, making step 2 impossible to execute.\n\nB. The procedure is incorrect because the variational principle requires minimizing the energy expectation value of a *fixed* Hamiltonian (that of Helium, with $Z=2$) with respect to parameters within a *trial wavefunction*, not minimizing the energy by varying a parameter within the Hamiltonian itself.\n\nC. The procedure is incorrect because the derivative $\\frac{dE_{gs}(Z)}{dZ}$ will yield a value of $Z$ that is not an integer, which is unphysical for an atomic nucleus.\n\nD. The procedure is incorrect because minimizing the energy with respect to $Z$ would find the most stable configuration among all two-electron atoms, but this minimum is likely to be a positive energy, corresponding to an unbound system where electron repulsion dominates.\n\nE. The procedure is incorrect because it treats the nuclear charge $Z$ as a physical variable to be optimized, whereas the variational principle only allows for optimizing unphysical parameters deliberately introduced into the trial wavefunction.", "solution": "The variational principle asserts that for a fixed Hamiltonian $H$, any normalized trial state $\\Psi$ satisfies\n$$\nE_{\\text{trial}}[\\Psi;H] \\equiv \\frac{\\langle \\Psi|H|\\Psi\\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi|\\Psi\\rangle} \\ge E_{gs}[H],\n$$\nwhere $E_{gs}[H]$ is the exact ground state energy of that same fixed $H$.

This optimization varies the Hamiltonian itself, so there is no inequality relating $\\min_{Z}E_{gs}(Z)$ to $E_{gs}(2)$; thus the result is not an upper bound nor an approximation justified by the variational principle for the Helium Hamiltonian.\n\nMoreover, by the Hellmann–Feynman theorem, for the exact ground state $\\Psi_{0}(Z)$,\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{gs}(Z)}{dZ}=\\left\\langle \\Psi_{0}(Z)\\middle|\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial Z}\\middle|\\Psi_{0}(Z)\\right\\rangle,\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial Z}=-\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\frac{1}{r_{i}}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{gs}(Z)}{dZ}=-\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_{0}}\\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\frac{1}{r_{i}}\\right\\rangle<0,\n$$\nso $E_{gs}(Z)$ is strictly decreasing in $Z$ and the equation $\\frac{dE_{gs}(Z)}{dZ}=0$ has no solution in the interior of any interval of $Z$. Hence the proposed minimization is mathematically ill-posed. However, the most fundamental reason the method fails for the stated purpose is that it violates the core requirement of the variational principle: the Hamiltonian must remain fixed while one varies the state.
