Since this function is real, its complex conjugate $\\Psi_{trial}^{*}(x)$ is the same as the function itself.\n\nFirst, let's find the action of the Hamiltonian on the trial wavefunction. We need to compute the second derivative of $\\Psi_{trial}(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\Psi_{trial}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\Psi_{trial}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) = -\\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2} \\Psi_{trial}(x)\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $\\hat{H}\\Psi_{trial}(x)$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} \\Psi_{trial}(x) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left(-\\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2} \\Psi_{trial}(x)\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2} \\Psi_{trial}(x) = \\frac{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{mL^2} \\Psi_{trial}(x)\n$$\nThis result shows that the trial function $\\Psi_{trial}(x)$ is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ with the eigenvalue $\\frac{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{mL^2}$.\n\nWhen the trial function is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian, the variational integral simplifies directly to the eigenvalue. The energy expectation value is:\n$$\nE_{trial} = \\frac{\\int_0^L \\Psi_{trial}(x) \\left(\\frac{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{mL^2} \\Psi_{trial}(x)\\right) dx}{\\int_0^L \\Psi_{trial}(x) \\Psi_{trial}(x) dx} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{mL^2} \\int_0^L \\Psi_{trial}^2(x) dx}{\\int_0^L \\Psi_{trial}^2(x) dx} = \\frac{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{mL^2}\n$$\nSo, the calculated energy is $E_{trial} = \\frac{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{mL^2}$. This eliminates options A, C, and E.\n\nNow we must determine why this is a poor choice for approximating the *ground state*. Let's recall the exact solutions for the particle in a box. The normalized energy eigenfunctions are $\\Psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ with corresponding energy eigenvalues $E_n = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$, where $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nThe true ground state corresponds to $n=1$, with energy $E_1 = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ and wavefunction $\\Psi_1(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. This wavefunction has no nodes (points where the function is zero) in the open interval $(0, L)$.\n\nOur trial function is $\\Psi_{trial}(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. This is the unnormalized eigenfunction for $n=2$. The corresponding energy is $E_2 = \\frac{2^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2mL^2} = \\frac{2\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{mL^2}$, which perfectly matches our calculated $E_{trial}$.\n\nSince the trial function is actually the exact wavefunction for the first excited state ($n=2$), it provides an upper bound to the ground state energy $E_1$ as required by the variational principle ($E_{trial} = E_2 > E_1$). However, it is a poor *approximation* because it describes a different physical state entirely. A key feature of the $n=2$ state is that it has a node at the center of the box, $x=L/2$, since $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (L/2)}{L}\\right) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$. The ground state ($n=1$) has no such node. The presence of this node is a fundamental qualitative difference.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining options:\n- Option B: Proposes the correct energy but gives an incorrect reason. The function $\\Psi_{trial}(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right)$ *does* satisfy the boundary conditions: $\\Psi_{trial}(0) = \\sin(0) = 0$ and $\\Psi_{trial}(L) = \\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\n- Option D: Proposes the correct energy and the correct fundamental reason. The function is a poor choice for the ground state because its nodal structure (one node at $x=L/2$) is that of the first excited state, not the nodeless ground state.\n\nTherefore, statement D is the correct choice.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2023249"}, {"introduction": "A powerful strategy in physics is to build upon what we already know.
