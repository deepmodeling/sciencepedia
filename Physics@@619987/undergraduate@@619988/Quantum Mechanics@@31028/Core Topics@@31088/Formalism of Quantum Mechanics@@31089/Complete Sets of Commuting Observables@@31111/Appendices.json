This set provides the maximum possible information about a quantum state. Consider a spinless particle moving in a three-dimensional central potential, described by $V(r)$, where $r$ is the radial distance from the origin. A student proposes that the set of operators corresponding to the three Cartesian components of the orbital angular momentum, $S = \\{L_x, L_y, L_z\\}$, can serve as a CSCO for this system.\n\nWhich one of the following statements correctly evaluates the student's proposal?\n\nA. The proposal is correct because for a central potential, the Hamiltonian commutes with all components of the angular momentum operator, implying that $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$ are all conserved quantities and can be measured simultaneously.\n\nB. The proposal is incorrect because the operators do not all commute with each other, which is a necessary condition for a set of observables to be simultaneously measurable and form a CSCO.\n\nC. The proposal is incorrect. Although the operators $L_x$, $L_y$, and $L_z$ commute with each other, their common eigenbasis is infinitely degenerate, so the set is not \"complete.\"\n\nD. The proposal's validity is dependent on the specific form of the potential $V(r)$. For a free particle where $V(r)=0$, the set forms a CSCO, but not for a Coulomb potential, $V(r) \\propto 1/r$.\n\nE. The proposal is correct. The three operators $\\{L_x, L_y, L_z\\}$ form a vector basis, and measuring the expectation value of each component is necessary and sufficient to uniquely determine the angular momentum state of the particle.", "solution": "Define the Hamiltonian for a spinless particle in a central potential as $H = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}^{2}}{2m} + V(r)$ with $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$. For a central potential, $V(r)$ is rotationally invariant. The generators of rotations are the components of the orbital angular momentum $\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{p}$ with components $L_{i} = \\epsilon_{ijk} r_{j} p_{k}$, where $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol.\n\nFirst, establish the commutation properties relevant to a central potential:\n1) The angular momentum components satisfy the $\\mathfrak{so}(3)$ algebra\n$$\n[L_{i}, L_{j}] = i \\hbar \\epsilon_{ijk} L_{k}.\n$$\nThus, $L_{x}$, $L_{y}$, and $L_{z}$ do not commute pairwise.\n\n2) Rotational invariance implies that $H$ commutes with the generators of rotations:\n$$\n[H, L_{i}] = 0.\n$$\nThis can be verified explicitly. Since $[V(r), r_{j}] = 0$ and $[V(r), p_{k}] = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r_{k}}$, one has\n$$\n[V(r), L_{i}] = \\epsilon_{ijk} r_{j} [V(r), p_{k}] = i \\hbar \\epsilon_{ijk} r_{j} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r_{k}}.\n$$\nBecause $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r_{k}} = \\frac{dV}{dr} \\frac{r_{k}}{r}$, the contraction gives $\\epsilon_{ijk} r_{j} r_{k} = 0$ (antisymmetric tensor contracted with a symmetric product), hence $[V(r), L_{i}] = 0$. Likewise, $\\mathbf{p}^{2}$ is a rotational scalar, so $[\\mathbf{p}^{2}, L_{i}] = 0$. Therefore $[H, L_{i}] = 0$.\n\nNow recall the necessary condition for a set of observables to be simultaneously measurable and to form a CSCO: the operators in the set must commute pairwise so that they admit a common eigenbasis whose joint eigenvectors are unique up to a phase (completeness may require adding further commuting operators to remove degeneracy).\n\nEvaluate the proposed set $S = \\{L_{x}, L_{y}, L_{z}\\}$ against this criterion. Using the angular momentum commutation relations,\n$$\n[L_{x}, L_{y}] = i \\hbar L_{z}, \\quad [L_{y}, L_{z}] = i \\hbar L_{x}, \\quad [L_{z}, L_{x}] = i \\hbar L_{y},\n$$\nnone of these commutators vanish except in the trivial subspace where $L_{x} = L_{y} = L_{z} = 0$ (the $l = 0$ sector). Hence $L_{x}$, $L_{y}$, and $L_{z}$ cannot be simultaneously diagonalized in general, so they cannot form a CSCO.\n\nAssess each option:\n- A is incorrect. Although $[H, L_{i}] = 0$ shows that each $L_{i}$ is conserved in a central potential, conservation does not imply mutual commutativity among $L_{x}$, $L_{y}$, and $L_{z}$. Since they do not commute with each other, they cannot be measured simultaneously.\n- B is correct. The operators in the proposed set do not all commute, violating a necessary condition for forming a CSCO.\n- C is incorrect because it asserts that $L_{x}$, $L_{y}$, and $L_{z}$ commute, which is false.\n- D is incorrect. The noncommutation $[L_{i}, L_{j}] \\neq 0$ holds regardless of the specific central potential, including the free case $V(r) = 0$ and the Coulomb potential.\n- E is incorrect. Expectation values of noncommuting components do not define a unique eigenstate, and mutual noncommutativity prevents simultaneous sharp values.\n\nFor a spinless particle in a central potential, a standard CSCO is $\\{H, L^{2}, L_{z}\\}$, since $[H, L^{2}] = 0$, $[H, L_{z}] = 0$, and $[L^{2}, L_{z}] = 0$, and their common eigenvectors are the usual stationary states labeled by quantum numbers such as $n$, $l$, and $m$ (with any additional quantum numbers as required by the radial problem).\n\nTherefore, the correct evaluation is that the proposal is incorrect because the three components do not commute with each other.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2086315"}, {"introduction": "Beyond mutual commutation, a CSCO must also be \"complete,\" meaning its set of eigenvalues uniquely specifies a single quantum state without ambiguity.
