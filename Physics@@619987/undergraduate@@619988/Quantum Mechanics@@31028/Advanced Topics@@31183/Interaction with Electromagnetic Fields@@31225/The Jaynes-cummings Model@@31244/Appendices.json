We apply it to the atomic part of the state:\n$$\\sigma_+ |g\\rangle = (|e\\rangle\\langle g|)|g\\rangle = |e\\rangle(\\langle g|g\\rangle)$$\nSince the atomic states are orthonormal, the inner product $\\langle g|g\\rangle = 1$.\nSo, $\\sigma_+ |g\\rangle = |e\\rangle$.\nThe operator $\\sigma_+$ does not affect the field state, so its action on the full state is:\n$$\\sigma_+ |g, 0\\rangle = |e, 0\\rangle$$\nNow, we apply the annihilation operator $a$ to this resulting state:\n$$a |e, 0\\rangle = a(|e\\rangle \\otimes |0\\rangle) = |e\\rangle \\otimes (a|0\\rangle)$$\nFrom the problem definition, the action of the annihilation operator on the vacuum state $|0\\rangle$ yields the null vector, $a|0\\rangle = 0$.\nTherefore,\n$$a |e, 0\\rangle = |e\\rangle \\otimes 0 = 0$$\nSo, the first term is zero: $a \\sigma_+ |g, 0\\rangle = 0$.\n\nNext, let's evaluate the \"emission\" term, $a^\\dagger \\sigma_- |g, 0\\rangle$:\nThe operator $\\sigma_-$ acts first on the atomic part of the state:\n$$\\sigma_- |g\\rangle = (|g\\rangle\\langle e|)|g\\rangle = |g\\rangle(\\langle e|g\\rangle)$$\nSince the atomic states are orthonormal, the inner product $\\langle e|g\\rangle = 0$.\nSo, $\\sigma_- |g\\rangle = |g\\rangle \\cdot 0 = 0$ (the null vector in the atomic Hilbert space).\nThe action on the full state is therefore:\n$$\\sigma_- |g, 0\\rangle = 0$$\nApplying any operator, including $a^\\dagger$, to the null vector results in the null vector.\nSo, the second term is also zero: $a^\\dagger \\sigma_- |g, 0\\rangle = a^\\dagger(0) = 0$.\n\nNow we combine the results to find the action of the full interaction Hamiltonian:\n$$H_{int} |g, 0\\rangle = \\hbar g(0 + 0) = 0$$\nThis result, the null vector, can be written as $0 \\cdot |g, 0\\rangle$.\nThus, we have shown that $H_{int}|g, 0\\rangle = 0 \\cdot |g, 0\\rangle$.

The statement $a |g, 0\\rangle = 0$ is correct, as $a$ acts on the $|0\\rangle$ part of the state. However, this is not a complete reason for $|g, 0\\rangle$ being an eigenstate of $H_{int}$, which also involves the term with $a^\\dagger$ and $\\sigma_-$. A state can be annihilated by $a$ but not be an eigenstate of $H_{int}$ (e.g., $|e, 0\\rangle$).\nC. The statement $a \\sigma_+ |g, 0\\rangle = 0$ is correct, as we showed. But this only accounts for one of the two terms in $H_{int}$, so it is an incomplete reason.\nD. The statement $a^\\dagger \\sigma_- |g, 0\\rangle = 0$ is also correct, as we showed. But this also accounts for only one of the two terms in $H_{int}$, so it is also an incomplete reason.\nE. This statement says the state is annihilated by both terms, $a \\sigma_+$ and $a^\\dagger \\sigma_-$. Since $H_{int}$ is a linear combination of these two terms, the state being annihilated by both is the direct and complete reason why it is an eigenstate of their sum (and thus of $H_{int}$).
