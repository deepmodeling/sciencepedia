To manipulate the state of the qubit, a classical monochromatic electromagnetic wave is applied, with its electric field given by $\\vec{E}(t) = \\vec{E}_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$. The wave is tuned to be in resonance with the atomic transition, i.e., $\\omega = \\omega_0$.\n\nUnder these resonant conditions, the system undergoes Rabi oscillations between the two states. The frequency of these oscillations, known as the Rabi frequency $\\Omega$, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the driving electric field, $E_0 = |\\vec{E}_0|$, according to the relation $\\Omega = \\frac{d E_0}{\\hbar}$, where $d$ is the magnitude of the transition dipole moment and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The intensity (power per unit area) of the electromagnetic wave is proportional to the square of the electric field amplitude, $I \\propto E_0^2$.\n\nInitially, the system is driven by a laser with a certain intensity, resulting in an electric field of amplitude $E_{0,1}$ and a Rabi frequency $\\Omega_1$.
