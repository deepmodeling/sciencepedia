Phase shifts are not arbitrary numbers; they are determined directly by the interaction potential through the Schrödinger equation. This exercise provides fundamental practice by guiding you through the calculation of the s-wave phase shift, $\\delta_0$, for a particle scattering from a simplified but physically insightful delta-function shell potential [@problem_id:2106982]. Tackling this problem will strengthen your ability to apply boundary conditions in quantum mechanics and build your physical intuition about how a repulsive potential affects a scattered wave.", "problem": "A non-relativistic particle of mass $m$ is undergoing low-energy scattering in three dimensions. The interaction between the particle and a scattering center is described by a simplified model potential that is spherically symmetric. This potential is a repulsive delta-function shell located at a radius $R$ from the origin, given by $V(r) = \\alpha \\delta(r-R)$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the strength of the repulsive interaction, and $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nWe are interested in the case of s-wave scattering, corresponding to the angular momentum quantum number $l=0$.
