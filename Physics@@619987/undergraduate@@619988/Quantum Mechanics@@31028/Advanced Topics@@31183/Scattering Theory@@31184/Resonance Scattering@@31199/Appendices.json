This exercise challenges you to think critically about the defining characteristic of a resonance, focusing on the relationship between the phase shift and the energy of the incident particle. By analyzing a hypothetical scenario where the phase shift is constant, you will solidify your understanding that a resonance is inherently a dynamic process, defined by a rapid change in phase shift over a narrow energy range.
