Consider a simplified two-channel model for the scattering of two identical atoms in a uniform external magnetic field, $B$. The \"open channel\" describes the initial scattering state of the two atoms, and the \"closed channel\" contains a molecular bound state.\n\nThe energy of the two-atom system at the scattering threshold in the open channel is dependent on the magnetic field as:\n$$E_{\\text{open}}(B) = - \\mu_{\\text{open}} B$$\n\nThe energy of the molecular bound state in the closed channel is given by:\n$$E_{\\text{closed}}(B) = E_c - \\mu_{\\text{closed}} B$$\n\nHere, the zero of energy has been set to the open channel's threshold energy at zero magnetic field. $E_c$ is the energy of the closed channel's bound state at zero magnetic field, and it is a positive value ($E_c > 0$).

For identical particles like fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle imposes strict symmetry requirements on the wavefunction, which can dramatically affect scattering. This conceptual problem [@problem_id:2093437] asks you to analyze why a Feshbach resonance's effectiveness depends critically on the spin preparation of the atoms, exploring why s-wave scattering is not always a given.", "problem": "In the field of ultracold atomic physics, a Feshbach resonance is a powerful technique for tuning the interaction strength between colliding particles. This is typically achieved by applying an external magnetic field to modify the s-wave ($l=0$) scattering length. The effectiveness of this technique relies on a significant rate of s-wave collisions.\n\nConsider a gas of identical spin-1/2 fermions being cooled to temperatures approaching absolute zero. At these temperatures, the kinetic energy of the particles is extremely low, and collisions with non-zero orbital angular momentum ($l  0$) are strongly suppressed by the centrifugal barrier. We examine two distinct initial preparations of the gas:\n\nScenario A: The gas is \"spin-polarized,\" meaning all fermionic atoms have been prepared in the exact same spin quantum state (for example, all are spin-up).\n\nScenario B: The gas is a \"spin-mixture,\" consisting of an equal number of atoms in the spin-up state and atoms in the spin-down state.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, which of the following statements correctly describes the expected effectiveness of using a Feshbach resonance to control interactions in these two scenarios?\n\nA. Feshbach resonances will be equally effective in controlling s-wave interactions in both Scenario A and Scenario B, as s-wave scattering is always the dominant collision channel at ultracold temperatures regardless of spin.\n\nB.

The symmetric spin state of the colliding pair in Scenario A is compatible with the symmetric nature of s-wave scattering.\n\nC. Feshbach resonances will be effective in Scenario B but strongly suppressed in Scenario A. The quantum statistics of identical particles in Scenario A forbid s-wave scattering, while it is allowed for collisions between distinguishable-spin particles in Scenario B.\n\nD. Feshbach resonances will be ineffective in both scenarios. The Pauli exclusion principle for identical fermions fundamentally requires an antisymmetric spatial wavefunction, which is incompatible with s-wave scattering.\n\nE. The effectiveness of a Feshbach resonance has no dependence on the spin preparation of the gas and is solely determined by the atomic species and the strength of the applied magnetic field.", "solution": "We consider two-body collisions at ultralow temperature and the symmetry constraints from quantum statistics.

Therefore the spatial part must be antisymmetric, which requires\n$$\n(-1)^{l}=-1 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad l\\ \\text{odd}.\n$$\nIn particular, $l=0$ (s-wave) is forbidden. Thus s-wave scattering is excluded by quantum statistics. At ultralow temperatures, the Wigner threshold laws state that the phase shifts scale as $\\delta_{l}\\propto k^{2l+1}$ and the partial cross sections scale as $\\sigma_{l}\\propto k^{4l}$ for short-range interactions, where $k$ is the relative wave number. Consequently, $l0$ channels (e.g., $l=1$ p-wave) are strongly suppressed by the centrifugal barrier, making elastic collision rates very small. Since magnetically tunable Feshbach resonances most effectively control the s-wave scattering length $a$, s-wave Feshbach control is ineffective in Scenario A.\n\nScenario B (spin mixture with spin-up and spin-down): the colliding atoms are in different internal states and are effectively distinguishable. Equivalently, for two-component fermions one can form both spin-singlet (antisymmetric) and spin-triplet (symmetric) combinations; the requirement of overall antisymmetry can then be satisfied by pairing an antisymmetric spin state with a symmetric spatial state. In particular, s-wave ($l=0$, spatially symmetric) scattering is allowed in the spin-antisymmetric channel. By the Wigner threshold laws, s-wave dominates at ultralow temperature, so elastic collisions are efficient.
