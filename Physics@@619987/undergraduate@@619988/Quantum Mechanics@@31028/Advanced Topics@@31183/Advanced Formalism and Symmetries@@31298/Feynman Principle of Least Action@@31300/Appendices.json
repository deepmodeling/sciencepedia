Consider a baseball of mass $m$ thrown from a pitcher's mound to a catcher's mitt. In our universe, the action $S$ for any macroscopic trajectory is enormous compared to $\\hbar$, and the baseball follows a nearly perfect classical parabolic path.\n\nIn this alternate universe with the larger $\\hbar'$, how would the collection of paths that meaningfully contribute to the baseball's trajectory differ from the one in our universe?\n\nA.

In this regime, the integral is dominated by stationary phase contributions: phases from paths with significantly different actions interfere destructively, while paths near stationary points of the action, defined by $\\delta S=0$ (the classical equations of motion), interfere constructively. This is the standard semiclassical argument that yields classical mechanics in the limit $\\hbar \\to 0$.\n\nMake this precise by expanding any path $x(t)$ about the classical solution $x_{\\text{cl}}(t)$ with fixed endpoints as $x(t)=x_{\\text{cl}}(t)+\\eta(t)$, where $\\eta(t_{i})=\\eta(t_{f})=0$.
