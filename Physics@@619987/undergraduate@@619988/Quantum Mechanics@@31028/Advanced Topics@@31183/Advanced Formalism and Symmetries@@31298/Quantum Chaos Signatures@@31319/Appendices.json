The molecule has a fixed center of mass and possesses an intrinsic reflection symmetry about the y-axis (parity). The energy levels of this molecule are measured while an external electric field, with magnitude $\\mathcal{E}$, is applied along the x-axis. The field magnitude $\\mathcal{E}$ is slowly varied from zero upwards.\n\nTwo distinct scenarios are investigated:\n\n1.  **Ideal Scenario:** The molecule is perfectly isolated. The physicist plots the energies of two specific states, State 1 and State 2, as a function of $\\mathcal{E}$. She observes that the energy level curves for these two states approach each other and intersect at a specific field strength $\\mathcal{E}_c$, creating a true degeneracy.\n\n2.  **Perturbed Scenario:** A weak, static magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. This magnetic field breaks the molecule's reflection symmetry. When the experiment is repeated under these new conditions, the physicist notes that as $\\mathcal{E}$ approaches $\\mathcal{E}_c$, the energy levels of State 1 and State 2 no longer cross. Instead, they approach each other and then seem to repel, resulting in an \"avoided crossing.\"\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical explanation for the difference in behavior between the Ideal and Perturbed scenarios?\n\nA. A true crossing is possible because the crossing states have different quantum numbers associated with a symmetry of the Hamiltonian; breaking that symmetry introduces a coupling between the states that causes level repulsion.\n\nB. Avoided crossings are a direct consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which forbids two distinct energy levels from having precisely the same energy value at the same parameter value.\n\nC. True crossings are a generic feature of complex, chaotic quantum systems, while avoided crossings are only observed in highly symmetric, integrable systems.\n\nD. The Pauli exclusion principle is the fundamental cause for level repulsion. In the perturbed scenario, the states are modified in a way that they behave like identical fermions, thus they cannot occupy the same energy level.\n\nE. Any true crossing is an artifact of finite experimental resolution. A sufficiently precise measurement would reveal that all apparent crossings in nature are, in fact, avoided crossings.", "solution": "We consider two instantaneous eigenstates, denoted by $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ and $\\lvert 2 \\rangle$, whose energies are tracked as a function of the control parameter $\\mathcal{E}$.

Hence the eigenstates can be chosen with definite symmetry quantum numbers (eigenvalues of $\\hat{\\Pi}$). If $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ and $\\lvert 2\\rangle$ belong to different symmetry sectors (different eigenvalues of $\\hat{\\Pi}$), then the off-diagonal matrix element is symmetry-forbidden:\n$$\nV(\\mathcal{E})=\\langle 1\\lvert \\hat{H}(\\mathcal{E})\\rvert 2\\rangle=0.\n$$\nTherefore, when $E_{1}(\\mathcal{E})$ and $E_{2}(\\mathcal{E})$ coincide at $\\mathcal{E}_{c}$, a true degeneracy is allowed because there is no coupling between the states. This is the standard symmetry-protected crossing mechanism.\n\nIn the Perturbed Scenario, a weak perpendicular magnetic field explicitly breaks the reflection symmetry, so\n$$\n[\\hat{H}'(\\mathcal{E}),\\hat{\\Pi}]\\neq 0,\n$$\nand states of different symmetry labels can now mix.

This is the content of the von Neumannâ€“Wigner non-crossing rule: in a one-parameter family of Hamiltonians, levels of the same symmetry generically do not cross; exact crossings occur only when symmetry forbids coupling.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate explanation is that the Ideal Scenario exhibits a symmetry-protected degeneracy between states with different symmetry quantum numbers, while the Perturbed Scenario breaks that symmetry, introduces a finite coupling, and yields avoided crossing. This corresponds precisely to option A. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect: avoided crossings are not caused by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle; generically, avoided crossings occur without fine tuning, whereas true crossings require symmetry; the Pauli exclusion principle is irrelevant to this two-level parametric degeneracy; and true degeneracies do occur in nature and are not artifacts of finite resolution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2111264"}, {"introduction": "Building on the qualitative idea of level repulsion, we can analyze the entire energy spectrum statistically.
