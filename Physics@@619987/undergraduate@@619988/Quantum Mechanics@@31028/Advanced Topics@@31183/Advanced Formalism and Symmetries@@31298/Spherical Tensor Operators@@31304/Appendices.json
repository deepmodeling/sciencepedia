This Hamiltonian is known to be a spherical tensor operator of rank $k=2$, which we can denote generically as $T^{(2)}$. The most general form of such an operator is a linear combination of its components, $V = \\sum_{q=-2}^{2} c_q T_q^{(2)}$, where $c_q$ are coefficients that do not depend on the spin degrees of freedom.\n\nWe are interested in the matrix elements of this operator between the spin-1/2 basis states, which are of the form $\\langle 1/2, m'_j | V | 1/2, m_j \\rangle$, where $m_j$ and $m'_j$ can each be either $+1/2$ or $-1/2$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes all possible matrix elements of any such rank-2 spherical tensor operator between any two spin-1/2 states?\n\nA.
