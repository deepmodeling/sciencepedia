However, the allowed energy $E$ of the particle is not quantized and can take any value within this range, forming a continuous energy spectrum.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why the energy spectrum is continuous?\n\nA. The energy spectrum is continuous because the reflection coefficient is exactly one for any energy $E < V_0$, which means no specific energies are selectively transmitted or absorbed by the potential.\n\nB. The energy spectrum is continuous because the Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that a particle that is not spatially localized (i.e., it extends to $x \\to -\\infty$) cannot have a quantized energy.\n\nC. The energy spectrum is continuous because the particle is in a scattering state. The corresponding wavefunction is not required to be normalizable over the entire domain $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, which removes the boundary condition constraints that lead to energy quantization.\n\nD. The energy spectrum is continuous due to the probabilistic nature of the quantum wavefunction, which allows for a superposition of an infinite number of energy states to describe the particle.\n\nE. The energy spectrum is continuous because, although the particle is totally reflected, its wavefunction penetrates the barrier as an evanescent wave for $x > 0$.

However, the crucial point is not the value of $R$ but the nature of the eigenfunctions and the boundary conditions they satisfy.\n\nEnergy quantization in one-dimensional quantum mechanics arises when the admissible eigenfunctions must be square-integrable over the entire domain, i.e.,\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |\\psi(x)|^{2}\\,dx < \\infty,\n$$\ntogether with boundary conditions at spatial infinity that enforce decay. This happens for bound states confined by the potential, leading to discrete spectra because the boundary conditions can be satisfied only for discrete $E$.\n\nIn the present problem, the state for $x<0$ is an incident plane wave plus a reflected plane wave. Such scattering states are not square-integrable on $(-\\infty,\\infty)$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{0} |\\exp(ikx) + r\\exp(-ikx)|^{2}\\,dx = \\infty.\n$$\nInstead, they are generalized eigenfunctions, normalized to delta functions, e.g., $\\langle k|k'\\rangle = 2\\pi\\delta(k-k')$, and they describe scattering states of the self-adjoint Hamiltonian on the full line. For scattering states, the boundary conditions do not quantize the energy; rather, the allowed labels $k$ (and hence $E=\\hbar^{2}k^{2}/2m$) form a continuum. There is no confinement enforcing square-integrability in both asymptotic regions; therefore no discrete spectrum arises in $0<E<V_{0}$.\n\nOption A cites $R=1$ as the reason, but $R=1$ is a consequence of $E<V_{0}$, not the fundamental spectral cause. Option B invokes the uncertainty principle inappropriately; energy quantization is governed by boundary conditions and the spectral properties of $H$, not by spatial localization alone. Option D refers to superposition, which is generic and does not determine whether the spectrum is discrete or continuous. Option E points to the evanescent tail in $x\\geq 0$, but evanescent penetration occurs also for bound states where energies are quantized; thus it is not the reason for continuity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the particle is in a scattering state whose wavefunction is not required to be normalizable over $(-\\infty,\\infty)$, removing the boundary condition constraints that lead to quantization.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2089540"}, {"introduction": "Most realistic potentials are finite and can support both a discrete spectrum of bound states and a continuous spectrum of scattering states.
