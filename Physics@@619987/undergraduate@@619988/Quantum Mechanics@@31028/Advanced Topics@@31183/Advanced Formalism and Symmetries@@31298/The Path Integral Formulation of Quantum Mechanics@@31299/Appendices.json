In our case, the \"variance\" is complex, $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{i\\hbar\\varepsilon}{m}$.\nThe convolution of two such kernels, each corresponding to a time step $\\varepsilon$, yields a kernel for a time step $2\\varepsilon$. The new variance is $\\sigma'^2 = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2 = \\frac{i\\hbar(2\\varepsilon)}{m}$.

The limit $N \\to \\infty$ is now implicitly taken, as the result no longer depends on $N$ or $\\varepsilon$ separately, but only on their product $t$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $K_N$ gives the final closed-form expression for the free particle propagator:\n$$K(q_f, t; q_i, 0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi i \\hbar t}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{im(q_f - q_i)^2}{2\\hbar t}\\right)$$\nThis is the correct and exact propagator for a one-dimensional free particle.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{2\\pi i \\hbar t}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{im(q_{f} - q_{i})^{2}}{2\\hbar t}\\right)}$$", "id": "2819371"}, {"introduction": "The power of path integrals is not limited to calculating propagators in real time.
