This first practice provides a foundational check on our understanding of the Berry phase. By analyzing a particle on a sphere whose radius is cyclically altered, we investigate the core requirement for a geometric phase to manifest: the dependence of the quantum state itself on the changing parameters [@problem_id:2081755]. This exercise clarifies that not all cyclic evolutions of a system's parameters lead to a Berry phase.", "problem": "A spinless quantum particle of mass $m$ is constrained to move freely on the surface of a sphere of radius $R$. The Hamiltonian for this system is given by $H = \\frac{\\mathbf{L}^2}{2mR^2}$, where $\\mathbf{L}^2$ is the operator for the square of the orbital angular momentum.\n\nAn experimentalist prepares the system in its ground state. They then perform an adiabatic cyclic process by slowly changing the radius of the sphere over a time interval $T$. The radius starts at an initial value $R_i$, is changed to some other values, and then returns to $R_i$ at the end of the process, such that $R(0) = R(T) = R_i$.\n\nCalculate the geometric phase, also known as the Berry phase, acquired by the particle's wavefunction after this one complete cycle.

The ground state is nondegenerate with $l=0$, $m=0$, so $E_{0}(R)=0$ and the instantaneous eigenstate can be chosen as the constant spherical harmonic $Y_{00}$.\n\nUnder an adiabatic, cyclic variation of the parameter $R(t)$ with $R(0)=R(T)=R_{i}$, the adiabatic theorem states that the system remains in the instantaneous ground state up to a phase which splits into a dynamical phase and a geometric (Berry) phase.
