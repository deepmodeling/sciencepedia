{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The central challenge in the Hartree model is that the potential for any given electron depends on the wavefunctions of all other electrons—the very functions we are trying to solve. The Self-Consistent Field (SCF) method elegantly resolves this \"chicken-and-egg\" problem through an iterative process: guess the orbitals, calculate the potential, solve for new orbitals, and repeat until convergence. This exercise [@problem_id:2031953] places you directly into this iterative loop, asking you to construct the effective potential for a single electron at a specific stage. It's a crucial test of your understanding of how the potential is built from previous results while properly excluding unphysical self-interaction.", "problem": "Consider a Self-Consistent Field (SCF) calculation for a neutral Beryllium atom (Be), which has a nuclear charge of $Z=4$ and an electron configuration of $1s^2 2s^2$. The SCF procedure, based on the Hartree model, is an iterative method to find the approximate single-particle electronic orbitals.\n\nThe process begins with an initial guess for the orbitals, denoted as $\\psi_{nl}^{(0)}(r)$. These are the 'zeroth iteration' orbitals. From these, an effective potential is constructed to solve for a new set of orbitals, $\\psi_{nl}^{(1)}$, in the first iteration. This process is repeated until the orbitals and their energies converge.\n\nLet's establish the notation for the problem:\n-   The orbital for an electron in the state with principal quantum number $n$ and angular momentum quantum number $l$ after the $k$-th iteration is $\\psi_{nl}^{(k)}(r_j)$, where $r_j$ is the position of the electron.\n-   The potential energy of an electron at position $r_i$ due to the nucleus is $V_{nuc}(r_i) = -Z e^2 / (4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r_i)$.\n-   The potential energy contribution at position $r_i$ from the time-averaged charge distribution of a single electron in orbital $\\psi_{nl}^{(k)}$ at position $r_j$ is given by the integral:\n$$ U_{nl}^{(k)}(r_i) = \\int |\\psi_{nl}^{(k)}(r_j)|^2 \\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 |r_i - r_j|} d^3 r_j $$\n\nThe task is to determine the effective potential for a specific electron at a particular stage of the calculation.

However, when constructing the potential for a given electron, self-interaction must be excluded: for the specific 2s electron under consideration, only the other 2s electron contributes.\n\nFor Beryllium with configuration $1s^2 2s^2$, the other electrons seen by a particular 2s electron are two $1s$ electrons and one other $2s$ electron. In an SCF iteration, the potential used to compute $\\psi_{2s}^{(2)}$ must be built from the orbitals obtained in the previous iteration, i.e., iteration $k=1$.
