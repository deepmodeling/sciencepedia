The molecule has a total of $N$ electrons. Both calculations are based on the (unknown) exact energy functional.\n- Calculation A uses a trial electron density $n_A(\\mathbf{r})$ that yields a total energy of $E_A = -289.44$ Hartrees.\n- Calculation B uses a different trial electron density $n_B(\\mathbf{r})$ that yields a total energy of $E_B = -289.51$ Hartrees.\n\nYou are given that both trial densities are \"v-representable\" (meaning they correspond to the ground-state density of some system of $N$ electrons with some local external potential) and they both correctly integrate to the total number of electrons $N$.\n\nBased *exclusively* on the variational principle as stated by the second Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, what is the most definitive conclusion that can be drawn from these results?\n\nA.

The proposed density is not symmetric under the operation $x \\to -x$, which is a required symmetry for any one-dimensional bound system centered at the origin.\n\nB.

Any wavefunction that could produce this density would not be square-integrable, violating a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics.\n\nE. The proposed density does not satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, as it is zero outside a finite region of space.", "solution": "For a one-electron system in one dimension, any physically acceptable density must be N-representable.

Since a physical one-electron density must be of the form $n(x) = |\\psi(x)|^{2} \\ge 0$ pointwise, no wavefunction can produce a density that is negative on a set of nonzero measure. Hence $n'(x)$ is not N-representable.\n\nRegarding the other options:\n- Smoothness at $x = \\pm L$ (option B) is not the most fundamental obstruction; even if a density is not smooth, non-negativity is the primary requirement, and smoothness issues can be secondary.\n- Square-integrability of a corresponding wavefunction (option D) would follow from non-negativity and normalization via $\\psi(x) = \\sqrt{n(x)}\\exp(i\\theta(x))$, so the failure here is not square-integrability but the impossibility of defining $\\sqrt{n'(x)}$ where $n'(x) < 0$.\n- The Heisenberg uncertainty principle (option E) does not forbid compact support; a wavefunction with compact support does not violate $\\sigma_{x}\\sigma_{p} \\ge \\hbar/2$. This is not the issue here.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental reason the trial density is unacceptable is that it becomes negative and thus cannot be the modulus square of any wavefunction.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1407240"}, {"introduction": "We now turn to the first Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, which establishes a remarkable one-to-one mapping between the ground-state electron density and the external potential.
