The coupling between the electron's spin angular momentum and its orbital angular momentum leads to a splitting of energy levels, a phenomenon known as fine structure. These fine structure levels are conventionally labeled using spectroscopic term symbols of the form $^{2S+1}L_J$. In this notation, $S$ is the total spin angular momentum quantum number, $L$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number (represented by a letter code: S for $L=0$, P for $L=1$, D for $L=2$, F for $L=3$, and so on), and $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number.\n\nFor a hydrogen atom, consider the electronic states associated with the principal quantum number $n=3$.

For a given principal quantum number $n$, $l$ can take on integer values from $0$ to $n-1$.\nFor $n=3$, the possible values for $l$ are $l=0, 1, 2$.\n\nNext, we associate each value of $l$ with its corresponding spectroscopic letter code for $L$. For a single-electron atom, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ is simply equal to $l$.\n- If $l=0$, the letter code is S.\n- If $l=1$, the letter code is P.\n- If $l=2$, the letter code is D.\n\nThen, we determine the total spin angular momentum quantum number, $S$, and the spin multiplicity, $2S+1$. The hydrogen atom has a single electron, which has a spin quantum number of $s=1/2$. Therefore, the total spin quantum number is $S=s=1/2$.\nThe spin multiplicity is calculated as $2S+1 = 2(\\frac{1}{2}) + 1 = 2$.\nThis means all the term symbols will be \"doublets\" (multiplicity of 2). This finding immediately eliminates option B, which lists \"singlets\" (multiplicity 1), and option E, which lists \"triplets\" (multiplicity 3).\n\nFinally, we determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$. The quantum number $J$ arises from the vector sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta, $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$. Its possible values range from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps. For a single-electron atom, we can use the quantum numbers $l$ and $s$, so the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number $j$ are $j = |l-s|, |l-s|+1, ..., l+s$.\n\nWe now calculate the possible $j$ values for each value of $l$:\n- For $l=0$ (S state) and $s=1/2$:\n  The only possible value for $j$ is $j = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2$.\n  This gives the term symbol $^2S_{1/2}$.\n\n- For $l=1$ (P state) and $s=1/2$:\n  The possible values for $j$ are $j = |1 - 1/2|, ..., 1+1/2$, which are $j=1/2$ and $j=3/2$.\n  This gives two term symbols: $^2P_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{3/2}$.\n\n- For $l=2$ (D state) and $s=1/2$:\n  The possible values for $j$ are $j = |2 - 1/2|, ..., 2+1/2$, which are $j=3/2$ and $j=5/2$.\n  This gives two term symbols: $^2D_{3/2}$ and $^2D_{5/2}$. Note that $j=1/2$ is not a possible value here. This eliminates option D, which incorrectly includes the term $^2D_{1/2}$.\n\nCombining all the possible term symbols we have found, the complete set for the $n=3$ shell is:\n$^2S_{1/2}$, $^2P_{1/2}$, $^2P_{3/2}$, $^2D_{3/2}$, $^2D_{5/2}$.\n\nComparing this complete set with the given choices:\n- Option A is incomplete, as it omits $^2P_{1/2}$ and $^2D_{3/2}$.\n- Option B has the wrong multiplicity.\n- Option C perfectly matches the derived set of term symbols.\n- Option D includes an invalid term, $^2D_{1/2}$.\n- Option E has the wrong multiplicity.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1993001"}, {"introduction": "The physical origin of the most significant fine structure splitting is the spin-orbit interaction, which is mathematically described by the operator $\\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{S}$.
