A \"calibration hyperbola\" is the locus of all events that have a fixed spacetime interval from the origin. For a timelike interval, this is described by the equation $(ct)^2 - x^2 = s^2$, where $s$ is a constant. On a spacetime diagram plotted in frame S, one can also draw purely geometric shapes, such as a Euclidean circle centered at the origin, described by $(ct)^2 + x^2 = R^2$, where $R$ is its radius on the page. While the hyperbola represents a Lorentz-invariant set of events, the circle is a frame-dependent construct.\n\nConsider an event $E$ that occurs in the future ($t>0$) and at a positive spatial coordinate ($x>0$) for the observer in frame S.

This means that in frame S', the particle is always at the spatial origin, $x'=0$. Consequently, the event $E$ must have the spatial coordinate $x'_E = 0$ in frame S'.\n\nThe time coordinate of event E in frame S', $t'_E$, is the proper time elapsed for the particle on its journey from the origin to event E. The spacetime interval is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it is the same in all inertial frames. The interval squared, $(\\Delta s)^2$, between the origin $(0,0)$ and event $E$ is given by:\n$$\n(\\Delta s)^2 = (ct_E)^2 - x_E^2 \\quad \\text{(in frame S)}\n$$\n$$\n(\\Delta s)^2 = (ct'_E)^2 - (x'_E)^2 \\quad \\text{(in frame S')}\n$$\n\nFrom the definition of the calibration hyperbola that E lies on, we know:\n$$\n(ct_E)^2 - x_E^2 = (c\\tau_0)^2\n$$\nThis value $(c\\tau_0)^2$ is the invariant spacetime interval squared between the origin and any event on the hyperbola, including E.\n\nTherefore, we can find the coordinates of E in frame S' by setting the invariant interval in S' equal to this value:\n$$\n(ct'_E)^2 - (x'_E)^2 = (c\\tau_0)^2\n$$\nSince $x'_E = 0$ in this frame, we have:\n$$\n(ct'_E)^2 = (c\\tau_0)^2\n$$\nAs $t'>0$ (the event is in the future of the origin), we get:\n$$\nct'_E = c\\tau_0\n$$\nSo, the coordinates of event E in frame S' are $(ct'_E, x'_E) = (c\\tau_0, 0)$.\n\n**3.

The equation for such a circle is $(ct')^2 + (x')^2 = (R')^2$.\nWe evaluate this for event E using its coordinates in frame S':\n$$\n(R')^2 = (ct'_E)^2 + (x'_E)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the coordinates we found:\n$$\n(R')^2 = (c\\tau_0)^2 + (0)^2 = (c\\tau_0)^2\n$$\nTaking the square root (radius is positive):\n$$\nR' = c\\tau_0\n$$\nThe radius $R'$ in the S' frame depends only on the proper time $\\tau_0$ and the speed of light $c$, and is independent of the original radius $R$ in the S frame (as long as $R > c\\tau_0$).
