However, this relativity reveals a deeper, more fundamental invariance: the spacetime interval. This exercise [@problem_id:400072] challenges you to apply this principle directly, showing how observers in different inertial frames may disagree on the time ($ \\Delta t $) and space ($ \\Delta x $) separating two events, but will always agree on the combined quantity $ (\\Delta s)^2 = (c\\Delta t)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 $. By calculating the spatial separation in a new frame, you will reinforce your understanding of how space and time coordinates must co-vary to preserve this invariant interval.", "problem": "Consider two events, A and B, which are separated by a timelike interval. In a laboratory inertial frame S, the temporal separation between the events is $T_0$ and the magnitude of their spatial separation is $L_0$.

An observer in S' measures the temporal separation between the same two events to be $2T_0$.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the spatial separation between events A and B as measured in the frame S'. Express your answer in terms of $c$, $T_0$, and $L_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the spatial separation between two events in a moving frame S', given their spatial and temporal separations in a laboratory frame S and the temporal separation in S'. The key principle to solve this problem efficiently is the invariance of the spacetime interval.\n\nThe spacetime interval, $(\\Delta s)^2$, between two events is an invariant quantity, meaning it has the same value in all inertial frames of reference. The interval is defined as:\n$$ (\\Delta s)^2 = (c \\Delta t)^2 - |\\Delta \\vec{r}|^2 $$\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the temporal separation and $\\Delta \\vec{r}$ is the spatial separation vector between the two events.\n\nLet's denote the quantities in the laboratory frame S with the subscript '0' and in the moving frame S' with a prime.\nIn the laboratory frame S, we are given:\n- Temporal separation: $\\Delta t = T_0$\n- Magnitude of spatial separation: $|\\Delta \\vec{r}| = L_0$\n\nThe spacetime interval calculated in frame S is:\n$$ (\\Delta s)^2 = (c T_0)^2 - L_0^2 $$\n\nIn the moving frame S', we are given:\n- Temporal separation: $\\Delta t' = 2T_0$\n- Magnitude of spatial separation: $|\\Delta \\vec{r}'| = L'$ (this is the quantity we need to find).\n\nThe spacetime interval calculated in frame S' is:\n$$ (\\Delta s')^2 = (c \\Delta t')^2 - |\\Delta \\vec{r}'|^2 = (c (2T_0))^2 - (L')^2 $$\n\nSince the spacetime interval is invariant, $(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta s')^2$. We can equate the expressions for the interval calculated in both frames:\n$$ (c T_0)^2 - L_0^2 = (c (2T_0))^2 - (L')^2 $$\n\nNow, we can solve for $L'$.\n$$ (c T_0)^2 - L_0^2 = 4(c T_0)^2 - (L')^2 $$\n\nRearranging the terms to isolate $(L')^2$:\n$$ (L')^2 = 4(c T_0)^2 - (c T_0)^2 + L_0^2 $$\n$$ (L')^2 = 3(c T_0)^2 + L_0^2 $$\n\nFinally, taking the square root to find the magnitude of the spatial separation $L'$. Since magnitude must be non-negative, we take the positive root:\n$$ L' = \\sqrt{3(c T_0)^2 + L_0^2} $$\n\nThis expression gives the spatial separation in the frame S'. Note that since the events are timelike-separated, $cT_0 > L_0$, which ensures that $(cT_0)^2 - L_0^2 > 0$. The expression for $L'$ is well-defined and real, as both $(cT_0)^2$ and $L_0^2$ are non-negative.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\sqrt{3c^2T_0^2 + L_0^2}} $$", "id": "400072"}, {"introduction": "We now shift from the abstract spacetime interval to its tangible physical meaning: the proper time, or the time measured by a clock moving between two events.
