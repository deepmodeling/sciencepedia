The Michelson-Morley experiment was designed to detect the motion of the Earth through this aether. According to the classical (pre-relativistic) model, this motion would create a \"wind\" that affects the speed of light differently along the two perpendicular arms of a Michelson interferometer. Rotating the apparatus by 90 degrees should then produce a measurable shift in the interference pattern, known as a fringe shift. The predicted magnitude of this shift depends on the apparatus's parameters.\n\nConsider two hypothetical experiments designed to test this aether theory.\n\n**Experiment Prime:** An interferometer with an arm length of $L_P$ is used. The apparatus is assumed to be moving at a speed $v_P$ relative to the stationary aether. The light source used in the experiment has a wavelength of $\\lambda_P$. According to classical predictions, a 90-degree rotation of this setup would result in a fringe shift of $\\Delta N_P$.\n\n**Experiment Secondary:** A different research group builds a second interferometer. This new apparatus has an arm length $L_S$, moves through the aether at a speed $v_S$, and utilizes a light source with a wavelength $\\lambda_S$.
