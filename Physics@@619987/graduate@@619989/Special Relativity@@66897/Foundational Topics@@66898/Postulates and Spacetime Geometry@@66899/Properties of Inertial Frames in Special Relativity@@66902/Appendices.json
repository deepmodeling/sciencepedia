We will calculate the latter, which we denote as $\\vec{V}$.\n\nThe velocity $\\vec{V}$ is the relativistic composition of the velocity of $S'$ with respect to $S$, which is $\\vec{v}_1 = (v_1, 0, 0)$, and the velocity of $S''$ with respect to $S'$, which is $\\vec{v}_2' = (0, v_2, 0)$.\n\nWe use the relativistic velocity addition formulas. If an object has velocity $\\vec{u}'$ in a frame $S'$ which moves with velocity $\\vec{v}$ relative to a frame $S$, the object's velocity $\\vec{u}$ in frame $S$ has components parallel ($u_\\parallel$) and perpendicular ($\\vec{u}_\\perp$) to $\\vec{v}$ given by:\n$$ u_\\parallel = \\frac{v + u'_\\parallel}{1 + \\frac{v u'_\\parallel}{c^2}} $$\n$$ \\vec{u}_\\perp = \\frac{\\vec{u}'_\\perp}{\\gamma_v \\left(1 + \\frac{v u'_\\parallel}{c^2}\\right)} $$\nwhere $\\gamma_v = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$.\n\nIn our problem, the \"lab frame\" is S, and frame $S'$ moves with velocity $\\vec{v} = \\vec{v}_1$ relative to S.
