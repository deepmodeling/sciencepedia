The defining condition in frame S' is:\n$$t'_C = \\frac{t'_A + t'_B}{2}$$\n\nWe can approach this problem geometrically using a Minkowski diagram in the coordinates of frame S, where the vertical axis is $ct$ and the horizontal axis is $x$.\n\n**1. Geometric Interpretation of the Condition**\n\nThe Lorentz transformation for the time coordinate of an event from frame S to frame S' is given by:\n$$t' = \\gamma \\left(t - \\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}$.\n\nLet's define a new event, M, which is the arithmetic midpoint of the spacetime coordinates of A and B in frame S. Note that this is a coordinate-dependent point, not a Lorentz-invariant one. The coordinates of M in frame S are:\n$$x_M = \\frac{x_A + x_B}{2}$$\n$$t_M = \\frac{t_A + t_B}{2}$$\n\nNow, let's find the time coordinate of event M in frame S', $t'_M$. Using the Lorentz transformation:\n$$t'_M = \\gamma \\left(t_M - \\frac{vx_M}{c^2}\\right) = \\gamma \\left( \\frac{t_A + t_B}{2} - \\frac{v(x_A + x_B)}{2c^2} \\right)$$\n$$t'_M = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\gamma\\left(t_A - \\frac{vx_A}{c^2}\\right) + \\gamma\\left(t_B - \\frac{vx_B}{c^2}\\right) \\right]$$\nRecognizing the terms in the parentheses as the Lorentz transformations for $t_A$ and $t_B$, we get:\n$$t'_M = \\frac{t'_A + t'_B}{2}$$\n\nBy comparing this result with the initial condition of the problem, $t'_C = (t'_A + t'_B)/2$, we arrive at a much simpler equivalent condition:\n$$t'_C = t'_M$$\nThis equation implies that events C and M are simultaneous in the reference frame S'.\n\n**2. Lines of Simultaneity in a Minkowski Diagram**\n\nIn the Minkowski diagram of frame S (with axes $x$ and $ct$), all events that are simultaneous in frame S' lie on a straight line. This line is called a line of simultaneity for frame S'. These lines are parallel to the spatial axis ($x'$-axis) of frame S'.\n\nThe $x'$-axis is defined by the condition $t' = 0$. From the Lorentz transformation for time, $ct' = \\gamma (ct - \\frac{v}{c}x) = 0$, which simplifies to:\n$$ct = \\frac{v}{c}x$$\nThis is the equation of the $x'$-axis in the S-frame's coordinate system. The slope of this line on the $(x, ct)$ diagram is:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta(ct)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{v}{c}$$\nAll lines of simultaneity for frame S' must be parallel to its $x'$-axis and thus share this same slope.\n\n**3. Solving for the Velocity**\n\nSince events C and M must be simultaneous in S', they must lie on the same line of simultaneity. Therefore, the line segment connecting the points C and M in the Minkowski diagram of frame S must have a slope equal to $v/c$.\n\nThe coordinates of the two points are $C(x_C, ct_C)$ and $M\\left(\\frac{x_A+x_B}{2}, c\\frac{t_A+t_B}{2}\\right)$. The slope of the line segment CM is:\n$$m_{CM} = \\frac{\\Delta(ct)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{ct_M - ct_C}{x_M - x_C} = \\frac{c\\left(\\frac{t_A+t_B}{2}\\right) - ct_C}{\\left(\\frac{x_A+x_B}{2}\\right) - x_C}$$\n$$m_{CM} = \\frac{c(t_A+t_B - 2t_C)}{x_A+x_B - 2x_C}$$\n\nEquating this slope to the required slope of a line of simultaneity, $m = v/c$:\n$$\\frac{v}{c} = c \\frac{t_A+t_B - 2t_C}{x_A+x_B - 2x_C}$$\n\nFinally, solving for the velocity $v$:\n$$v = c^2 \\frac{t_A+t_B - 2t_C}{x_A+x_B - 2x_C}$$\nThis is the velocity of the frame S' that satisfies the given condition.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{c^2 \\frac{t_A+t_B - 2t_C}{x_A+x_B - 2x_C}} $$", "id": "388797"}, {"introduction": "Having explored lines of simultaneity, we now turn to how geometric shapes and their features are represented in spacetime.
