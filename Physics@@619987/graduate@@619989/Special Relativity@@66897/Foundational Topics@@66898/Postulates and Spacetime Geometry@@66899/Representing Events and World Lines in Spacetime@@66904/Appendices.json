Successfully navigating this problem [@problem_id:405843] will cement your understanding of how Lorentz transformations affect the very sequence of events in spacetime.", "problem": "An inertial reference frame S' moves with a constant velocity $v$ along the positive x-axis of another inertial frame S. The origins and axes of the two frames are aligned, and the event of their origins coinciding is defined as the spacetime origin for both, i.e., $(t, x) = (0, 0)$ in S corresponds to $(t', x') = (0, 0)$ in S'.\n\nAlong the entire x-axis of frame S, there is an infinite line of explosive charges. By prior arrangement, all of these charges are detonated simultaneously at time $t=0$ according to clocks synchronized within frame S. The light flash from each explosion travels outwards in all directions.\n\nAn observer in the S' frame has a light detector located at a fixed position $x'_D$ on the x'-axis. This detector records the arrival times of the light flashes from the various explosions. Due to the relativity of simultaneity and the finite speed of light, the flashes will be detected at different times.\n\nDetermine the coordinate $x$ (in frame S) of the specific explosive charge whose light flash is the first to arrive at the detector. Express your answer in terms of $x'_D$, the relative velocity $v$, and the speed of light $c$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the position $x$ of an explosive charge in frame S whose light reaches a detector in frame S' at the earliest possible time.\n\n**Step 1: Spacetime coordinates of the explosions**\n\nIn frame S, the explosions are simultaneous at $t=0$. The event of an explosion at a position $x$ on the S-frame's x-axis has the spacetime coordinates $(t_E, x_E) = (0, x)$.\n\n**Step 2: Lorentz transformation of the explosion events**\n\nWe need to find the coordinates of these explosion events in the S' frame. The standard Lorentz transformations for an object moving along the x-axis are:\n$$t' = \\gamma \\left(t - \\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right)$$\n$$x' = \\gamma (x - vt)$$\nwhere $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\nFor an explosion event $E_x$ at $(t_E, x_E) = (0, x)$ in S, the coordinates in S' are $(t'_E, x'_E)$:\n$$t'_E(x) = \\gamma \\left(0 - \\frac{vx}{c^2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\gamma v x}{c^2}$$\n$$x'_E(x) = \\gamma (x - v \\cdot 0) = \\gamma x$$\nThese equations tell us that in frame S', the explosions are not simultaneous. An explosion at a given S-frame position $x$ occurs at S'-frame time $t'_E(x)$ and S'-frame position $x'_E(x)$.\n\n**Step 3: Light travel time to the detector**\n\nThe detector is at a fixed position $x'_D$ in frame S'. Light from the explosion at $x'_E(x)$ is emitted at time $t'_E(x)$. This light must travel to the detector's position $x'_D$. The distance the light pulse travels in frame S' is $|x'_D - x'_E(x)|$. Since light travels at speed $c$ in all inertial frames, the travel time, $\\Delta t'$, is:\n$$\\Delta t' = \\frac{|x'_D - x'_E(x)|}{c}$$\n\n**Step 4: Arrival time at the detector**\n\nThe time of arrival $T'$ of the flash at the detector is the sum of the emission time $t'_E$ and the travel time $\\Delta t'$. This arrival time is a function of the original position $x$ of the charge in frame S.\n$$T'(x) = t'_E(x) + \\Delta t' = -\\frac{\\gamma v x}{c^2} + \\frac{|x'_D - \\gamma x|}{c}$$\n\n**Step 5: Minimizing the arrival time**\n\nTo find which charge's flash arrives first, we must find the value of $x$ that minimizes the function $T'(x)$. It is more convenient to perform the minimization with respect to the S'-frame position of the explosion, $x'_E = \\gamma x$. Let's call this variable $X' = \\gamma x$.\nThe arrival time as a function of $X'$ is:\n$$T'(X') = -\\frac{v X'}{c^2} + \\frac{|x'_D - X'|}{c}$$\nWe need to minimize $T'(X')$ with respect to $X'$. We can do this by examining the function's derivative.\nThe function involves an absolute value, so we consider two cases:\nCase 1: $X' > x'_D$.\nIn this case, $|x'_D - X'| = X' - x'_D$.\n$$T'(X') = -\\frac{v X'}{c^2} + \\frac{X' - x'_D}{c} = X' \\left(\\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{v}{c^2}\\right) - \\frac{x'_D}{c} = \\frac{X'}{c}\\left(1 - \\frac{v}{c}\\right) - \\frac{x'_D}{c}$$\nThe derivative with respect to $X'$ is $\\frac{dT'}{dX'} = \\frac{1}{c}\\left(1 - \\frac{v}{c}\\right)$. Since $v  c$, this slope is positive.\n\nCase 2: $X'  x'_D$.\nIn this case, $|x'_D - X'| = x'_D - X'$.\n$$T'(X') = -\\frac{v X'}{c^2} + \\frac{x'_D - X'}{c} = -X' \\left(\\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{v}{c^2}\\right) + \\frac{x'_D}{c} = -\\frac{X'}{c}\\left(1 + \\frac{v}{c}\\right) + \\frac{x'_D}{c}$$\nThe derivative with respect to $X'$ is $\\frac{dT'}{dX'} = -\\frac{1}{c}\\left(1 + \\frac{v}{c}\\right)$. Since $v > 0$ (as per problem statement, S' moves along the positive x-axis), this slope is negative.\n\nThe derivative $\\frac{dT'}{dX'}$ is negative for $X'  x'_D$ and positive for $X' > x'_D$. This indicates that the function $T'(X')$ has a unique minimum at the point where the behavior changes, which is $X' = x'_D$.\n\n**Step 6: Finding the position x in frame S**\n\nThe arrival time is minimized when the explosion occurs at the S'-frame position $X' = x'_D$. We can now find the corresponding position $x$ in frame S using the relation $X' = \\gamma x$.\n$$x'_D = \\gamma x$$\nSolving for $x$, we get:\n$$x = \\frac{x'_D}{\\gamma}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the Lorentz factor $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$:\n$$x = x'_D \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\nThis is the position in frame S of the charge whose light flash is the first to arrive at the detector at $x'_D$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{x'_D \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$", "id": "405843"}]}
