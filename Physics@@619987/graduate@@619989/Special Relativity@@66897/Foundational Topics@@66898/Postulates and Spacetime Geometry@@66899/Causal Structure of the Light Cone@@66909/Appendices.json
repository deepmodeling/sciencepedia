This condition is mathematically expressed as the locus of points satisfying $(x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2 - c^2(t-t_0)^2 = 0$, with the additional causality constraint $t > t_0$.\n\nConsider two distinct events, A and B, that are spacelike separated. Without loss of generality, we can choose an inertial reference frame S where these events are simultaneous and lie on the x-axis, symmetric with respect to the origin.
