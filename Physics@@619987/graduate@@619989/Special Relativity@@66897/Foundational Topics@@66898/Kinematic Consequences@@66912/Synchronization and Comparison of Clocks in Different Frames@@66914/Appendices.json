This point is chosen such that the light flash arrives at the worldlines of clock $C_1$ and clock $C_2$ at the same time as measured in the $S'$ frame. At these moments of arrival, the clocks $C_1$ and $C_2$ are set to show the same time, say $T_0$.\n\nAssuming this synchronization procedure is carried out successfully, what is the resulting time difference, $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$, between the readings of the two clocks as measured by an observer in the laboratory frame $S$?
