Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the clock. We can solve this problem by first calculating the time interval in the stationary frame of the detection region (the lab frame) and then relating it to the proper time using the time dilation formula.\n\nLet S be the inertial frame of reference in which the detection region is at rest.
