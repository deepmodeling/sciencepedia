This practice problem considers a spaceship traveling away from Earth and then returning at the same speed. By analyzing the frequencies received during both legs of the trip [@problem_id:402276], you will directly apply the formulas for redshift (for a receding source) and blueshift (for an approaching source) and see how they create a predictable range of observed frequencies.", "problem": "A spaceship is sent on a round-trip mission to a distant star. It departs from Earth, travels along a straight line at a constant relativistic speed $v$, and upon reaching its destination, it instantaneously reverses course and returns to Earth along the same path at the same constant speed $v$.\n\nThroughout its journey, the spaceship emits a continuous electromagnetic signal from an onboard beacon. In the spaceship's own rest frame, this beacon has a constant frequency $f_0$. An observer on Earth continuously monitors the frequency of the signal received from the spaceship.\n\nLet $f_{high}$ be the highest frequency and $f_{low}$ be the lowest frequency measured by the Earth-based observer during the spaceship's entire trip. Determine the ratio $\\frac{f_{high}}{f_{low}}$ in terms of the spaceship's speed $v$ and the speed of light $c$.", "solution": "The problem requires the application of the relativistic Doppler effect for electromagnetic radiation. The frequency of the signal measured by the observer on Earth depends on whether the spaceship is moving away from or towards Earth.\n\nLet $S$ be the rest frame of the Earth and $S'$ be the rest frame of the spaceship. The spaceship moves with a speed $v$ relative to Earth. The beacon on the spaceship emits a signal with a proper frequency $f_0$ in frame $S'$.\n\nThe general formula for the relativistic Doppler effect for a source moving directly along the line of sight to an observer is:\n$$ f_{obs} = f_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 \\mp v/c}{1 \\pm v/c}} $$\nwhere $f_{obs}$ is the observed frequency. The top signs ($-/+$) correspond to the source receding from the observer (redshift), and the bottom signs ($+/-$) correspond to the source approaching the observer (blueshift).\n\n**1. Outbound Trip (Receding Source)**\n\nDuring the first part of its journey, the spaceship is moving directly away from Earth. This corresponds to a receding source. The frequency measured by the Earth observer will be lower than the proper frequency $f_0$ due to redshift. This will be a candidate for the lowest observed frequency, $f_{low}$.\n\nUsing the Doppler formula for a receding source:\n$$ f_{away} = f_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}} $$\nSince $v > 0$, the term under the square root is less than 1, so $f_{away}  f_0$.\n\n**2. Inbound Trip (Approaching Source)**\n\nDuring the return trip, the spaceship is moving directly towards Earth. This corresponds to an approaching source. The frequency measured by the Earth observer will be higher than the proper frequency $f_0$ due to blueshift. This will be a candidate for the highest observed frequency, $f_{high}$.\n\nUsing the Doppler formula for an approaching source:\n$$ f_{towards} = f_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} $$\nSince $v > 0$, the term under the square root is greater than 1, so $f_{towards} > f_0$.\n\n**3. Identifying Highest and Lowest Frequencies**\n\nBy comparing the expressions, it is clear that $f_{towards} > f_0 > f_{away}$. Therefore, the highest frequency measured is $f_{high} = f_{towards}$ and the lowest frequency measured is $f_{low} = f_{away}$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Ratio**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\frac{f_{high}}{f_{low}}$. We can now substitute the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\frac{f_{high}}{f_{low}} = \\frac{f_{towards}}{f_{away}} = \\frac{f_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}}{f_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}} $$\n\nThe proper frequency $f_0$ cancels out:\n$$ \\frac{f_{high}}{f_{low}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{1 - v/c}{1 + v/c}\\right)}} $$\n\nSimplifying the expression inside the square root:\n$$ \\frac{f_{high}}{f_{low}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1 + v/c)(1 + v/c)}{(1 - v/c)(1 - v/c)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1 + v/c)^2}{(1 - v/c)^2}} $$\n\nTaking the square root of the numerator and denominator gives:\n$$ \\frac{f_{high}}{f_{low}} = \\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c} $$\n\nTo express this in terms of $v$ and $c$ without fractions in the numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by $c$:\n$$ \\frac{f_{high}}{f_{low}} = \\frac{c(1 + v/c)}{c(1 - v/c)} = \\frac{c + v}{c - v} $$\nThis is the final expression for the ratio of the highest to the lowest frequency.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{c+v}{c-v}} $$", "id": "402276"}, {"introduction": "Now, let's move from a hypothetical round-trip to a scenario inspired by real astrophysical measurements.
