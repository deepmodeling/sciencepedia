If the center of this hyperbola is at $(t_c, x_c)$, the worldline can be parameterized by the rapidity $\\phi$.

A homogeneous system with a non-zero determinant has only the trivial solution.\n    Therefore, $X=0$ and $Y=0$.\n    $$ x-x_c = 0 \\implies x = x_c $$\n    $$ c(t-t_c) = 0 \\implies t = t_c $$\n    The unique intersection event occurs at the coordinates $(t, x) = (t_c, x_c)$, which is the center of the hyperbola. This is independent of the choice of $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$, confirming that all lines of simultaneity intersect at this single point.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Squared Spacetime Interval**\n    The problem asks for the squared spacetime interval $S^2$ of the intersection event from the origin. The coordinates of the intersection event are $(t,x) = (t_c, x_c)$.\n    $$ S^2 = x^2 - c^2 t^2 $$\n    Substituting the coordinates of the intersection point:\n    $$ S^2 = x_c^2 - c^2 t_c^2 $$\n\nThis is the final expression for the squared interval.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{x_c^2 - c^2 t_c^2} $$", "id": "414948"}]}
