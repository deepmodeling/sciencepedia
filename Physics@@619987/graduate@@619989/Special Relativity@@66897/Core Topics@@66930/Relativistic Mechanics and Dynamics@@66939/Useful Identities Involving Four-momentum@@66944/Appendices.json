We can isolate the sum of their four-momenta:\n    $$p_1 + p_2 = P - p_3$$\n\n3.  **Calculating the Invariant Mass Squared $s_{12}$**\n    The invariant mass squared of the $(m_1, m_2)$ subsystem is $s_{12} = (p_1 + p_2)^2$.

This occurs when their kinetic energies in their CM frame are zero, meaning their momenta are zero: $\\vec{p}^* = \\vec{0}$.\n    In this limiting case, the energies are simply their rest masses: $E_1^* = m_1$ and $E_2^* = m_2$.\n    The minimum possible value for the invariant mass of the subsystem is therefore:\n    $$\\sqrt{s_{12}}_{\\text{min}} = m_1 + m_2$$\n\n8.  **Final Calculation**\n    This minimum value of the invariant mass $\\sqrt{s_{12}}$ corresponds to the kinematic configuration where particles 1 and 2 move together with zero relative velocity. This configuration maximizes the energy available to particle 3, thus maximizing its kinetic energy.\n    The problem asks for the value of the invariant mass squared, $s_{12}$, under this condition. We square the minimum value of the invariant mass:\n    $$s_{12} = (\\sqrt{s_{12}}_{\\text{min}})^2 = (m_1 + m_2)^2$$\n    This is the value of $s_{12}$ when $T_3$ is at its maximum.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(m_1 + m_2)^2}$$", "id": "414081"}]}
