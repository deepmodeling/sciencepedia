The particle's kinetic energy is maintained at a constant value $K$. According to the principles of special relativity, a centripetal force is required to maintain this circular path. Let $c$ be the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nDetermine the magnitude of the required centripetal force, $F$, expressed in terms of $m$, $K$, $R$, and $c$.", "solution": "The relativistic form of Newton's second law states that the net force $\\vec{F}$ on a particle is equal to the rate of change of its relativistic momentum $\\vec{p}$:\n$$ \\vec{F} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} $$\nThe relativistic momentum is given by $\\vec{p} = \\gamma m \\vec{v}$, where $\\vec{v}$ is the particle's velocity, $m$ is its rest mass, and $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor, with $v = |\\vec{v}|$.\n\nFor a particle in uniform circular motion, the magnitude of its velocity, $v$, is constant. Consequently, the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ is also constant. We can apply the product rule to the expression for force:\n$$ \\vec{F} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\gamma m \\vec{v}) = m \\frac{d(\\gamma \\vec{v})}{dt} = m \\left( \\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}\\vec{v} + \\gamma \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} \\right) $$\nSince $v$ is constant, $\\gamma$ is constant, which means $\\frac{d\\gamma}{dt} = 0$. The expression for the force simplifies to:\n$$ \\vec{F} = \\gamma m \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} $$\nThe term $\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt}$ is the acceleration $\\vec{a}$. For uniform circular motion of radius $R$ and speed $v$, the acceleration is purely centripetal, directed towards the center of the circle, with magnitude $a = v^2/R$. Therefore, the magnitude of the centripetal force is:\n$$ F = \\gamma m \\frac{v^2}{R} $$\nThe problem provides the kinetic energy $K$, not the speed $v$.
