Let S' be the reference frame in which one of the pions (say, the $\\pi^+$) is at rest. Our goal is to find the kinetic energy of the other pion ($\\pi^-$) in the frame S'.\n\n**Step 1: Conservation of Four-Momentum in the Lab Frame (S)**\n\nThe four-momentum of a particle is given by $P = (E/c, \\vec{p})$, where $E$ is the total energy and $\\vec{p}$ is the three-momentum. The invariant square of the four-momentum is $P \\cdot P = (E/c)^2 - \\vec{p}^2 = (m_0 c)^2$, where $m_0$ is the rest mass.\n\nInitially, the kaon is at rest, so its three-momentum is $\\vec{p}_K = \\vec{0}$ and its total energy is its rest energy, $E_K = m_K c^2$. Its four-momentum is:\n$$P_K = (m_K c, \\vec{0})$$\n\nAfter the decay, two pions are created. Let their four-momenta be $P_{\\pi^+}$ and $P_{\\pi^-}$. By conservation of four-momentum:\n$$P_K = P_{\\pi^+} + P_{\\pi^-}$$\n\nFrom the conservation of three-momentum (the spatial part of the four-momentum):\n$$\\vec{p}_K = \\vec{p}_{\\pi^+} + \\vec{p}_{\\pi^-}$$\nSince $\\vec{p}_K = \\vec{0}$, we must have $\\vec{p}_{\\pi^+} = -\\vec{p}_{\\pi^-}$. This means the pions are emitted in opposite directions with equal magnitudes of momentum. Let $p = |\\vec{p}_{\\pi^+}| = |\\vec{p}_{\\pi^-}|$.\n\nFrom the conservation of energy (the temporal part of the four-momentum):\n$$E_K = E_{\\pi^+} + E_{\\pi^-}$$\nSince the pions have the same rest mass $m_\\pi$ and the same magnitude of momentum $p$, their total energies must be equal:\n$$E_{\\pi^+} = E_{\\pi^-} = \\sqrt{(pc)^2 + (m_{\\pi}c^2)^2} = E_{\\pi}$$\nSubstituting this into the energy conservation equation:\n$$m_K c^2 = E_{\\pi} + E_{\\pi} = 2E_{\\pi}$$\nThus, the energy of each pion in the lab frame is:\n$$E_{\\pi} = \\frac{m_K c^2}{2}$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculating Energy in the Pion's Rest Frame (S') using Invariant Product**\n\nWe want to find the energy of the $\\pi^-$ particle in the rest frame of the $\\pi^+$ particle (frame S'). A convenient method is to use the Lorentz-invariant dot product of four-momenta.\n\nThe energy of a particle B ($E'_B$) in the rest frame of a particle A is given by the relation:\n$$E'_B = \\frac{P_A \\cdot P_B}{m_A}$$\nwhere $P_A$ and $P_B$ are the four-momenta in any inertial frame, and $m_A$ is the rest mass of particle A.\n\nIn our case, particle A is the $\\pi^+$ and particle B is the $\\pi^-$.
