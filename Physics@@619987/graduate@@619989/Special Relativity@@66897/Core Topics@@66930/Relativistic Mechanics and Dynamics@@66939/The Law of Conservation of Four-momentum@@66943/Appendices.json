A single neutral massive particle with $M=2 m_{e}$ can be produced at rest to match $\\vec{p}_{f}=\\vec{0}$. Then $E_{f}=M c^{2}=2 m_{e} c^{2}$, which equals $E_{i}$.

Momentum conservation demands $\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}=\\vec{0}$, which forces $E_{\\gamma}=0$, contradicting energy conservation since $E_{i}=2 m_{e} c^{2}>0$. Equivalently, equating $(E_{\\gamma}/c,\\vec{p}_{\\gamma})=(2 m_{e} c,\\vec{0})$ implies $|\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}|=0$ and $E_{\\gamma}=2 m_{e} c^{2}$, but the photon condition $|\\vec{p}_{\\gamma}|=E_{\\gamma}/c$ would then read $0=2 m_{e} c$, a contradiction.
