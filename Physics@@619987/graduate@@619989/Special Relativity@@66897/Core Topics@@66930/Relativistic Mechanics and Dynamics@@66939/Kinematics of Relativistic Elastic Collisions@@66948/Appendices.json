The dynamics of such collisions are governed by the conservation of the total 4-momentum. The 4-momentum of a particle with rest mass $m$, energy $E$, and 3-momentum $\\vec{p}$ is given by the 4-vector $P^\\mu = (E/c, \\vec{p})$. The total 4-momentum of a system of particles is the sum of their individual 4-momenta, and it is conserved in any collision. An important Lorentz-invariant property of a single particle's 4-momentum is its squared magnitude, $P^\\mu P_\\mu = (E/c)^2 - |\\vec{p}|^2 = (mc)^2$, where the flat-space Minkowski metric with signature $(+,-,-,-)$ is used.\n\nConsider a head-on elastic collision between a projectile particle of mass $m_p$ and a target particle of mass $m_t$. The target particle is initially at rest in the laboratory frame. In non-relativistic classical mechanics, the projectile will come to a complete stop after the collision if and only if its mass is equal to the target's mass.\n\nIn the context of special relativity, determine the mass ratio $m_p/m_t$ for which it is kinematically possible for the projectile to come to a complete rest in the laboratory frame following the collision.

The problem specifies a head-on elastic collision in the laboratory frame.\n\n**1. Initial State (before the collision):**\nThe projectile particle of mass $m_p$ moves with some initial 4-momentum $P_{p,i}^\\mu = (E_{p,i}/c, \\vec{p}_{p,i})$.\nThe target particle of mass $m_t$ is stationary, so its 3-momentum is zero. Its energy is its rest energy $m_t c^2$. Thus, its 4-momentum is $P_{t,i}^\\mu = (m_t c, \\vec{0})$.\n\n**2. Final State (after the collision):**\nThe problem asks for the condition under which the projectile comes to rest. This means its final 3-momentum is zero. Its energy is then its rest energy, $m_p c^2$. The final 4-momentum of the projectile is $P_{p,f}^\\mu = (m_p c, \\vec{0})$.\nThe target particle moves off with some final 4-momentum $P_{t,f}^\\mu = (E_{t,f}/c, \\vec{p}_{t,f})$.\n\n**3. Conservation of 4-Momentum:**\nThe total 4-momentum of the system is conserved:\n$$\nP_{p,i}^\\mu + P_{t,i}^\\mu = P_{p,f}^\\mu + P_{t,f}^\\mu\n$$\n\nWe can solve for the final 4-momentum of the target particle:\n$$\nP_{t,f}^\\mu = P_{p,i}^\\mu + P_{t,i}^\\mu - P_{p,f}^\\mu\n$$\n\n**4. Using the Lorentz Invariant Mass:**\nThe squared magnitude of any particle's 4-momentum is a Lorentz invariant equal to $(mc)^2$. For the final target particle, we must have:\n$$\nP_{t,f}^\\mu P_{t,f, \\mu} = (m_t c)^2\n$$\nLet's compute the square of the right-hand side of the rearranged conservation equation:\n$$\nP_{t,f}^\\mu P_{t,f, \\mu} = (P_{p,i}^\\mu + P_{t,i}^\\mu - P_{p,f}^\\mu)(P_{p,i, \\mu} + P_{t,i, \\mu} - P_{p,f, \\mu})\n$$\nExpanding the product gives:\n$$\n(m_t c)^2 = P_{p,i}^2 + P_{t,i}^2 + P_{p,f}^2 + 2 P_{p,i} \\cdot P_{t,i} - 2 P_{p,i} \\cdot P_{p,f} - 2 P_{t,i} \\cdot P_{p,f}\n$$\nwhere we use the shorthand $P^2 = P^\\mu P_\\mu$ and $A \\cdot B = A^\\mu B_\\mu$.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Terms:**\nWe can evaluate each term in the expansion using the given information:\n*   $P_{p,i}^2 = (m_p c)^2$ (invariant mass of the projectile)\n*   $P_{t,i}^2 = (m_t c)^2$ (invariant mass of the target)\n*   $P_{p,f}^2 = (m_p c)^2$ (invariant mass of the projectile)\n\nThe dot products are (using $A \\cdot B = A^0 B^0 - \\vec{A}\\cdot\\vec{B}$ and $P^\\mu=(E/c, \\vec{p})$):\n*   $P_{p,i} \\cdot P_{t,i} = (E_{p,i}/c)(m_t c) - \\vec{p}_{p,i} \\cdot \\vec{0} = E_{p,i} m_t$.\n*   $P_{p,i} \\cdot P_{p,f} = (E_{p,i}/c)(m_p c) - \\vec{p}_{p,i} \\cdot \\vec{0} = E_{p,i} m_p$.\n*   $P_{t,i} \\cdot P_{p,f} = (m_t c)(m_p c) - \\vec{0} \\cdot \\vec{0} = m_t m_p c^2$.\n\n**6. Solving the Equation:**\nSubstituting these expressions back into the expanded equation:\n$$\n(m_t c)^2 = (m_p c)^2 + (m_t c)^2 + (m_p c)^2 + 2 E_{p,i} m_t - 2 E_{p,i} m_p - 2 m_t m_p c^2\n$$\nWe can cancel the $(m_t c)^2$ term from both sides and divide the entire equation by $2$:\n$$\n0 = m_p^2 c^2 + E_{p,i} m_t - E_{p,i} m_p - m_t m_p c^2\n$$\nNow, we rearrange the terms to factor out the common term $(m_p - m_t)$:\n$$\nE_{p,i} (m_p - m_t) = m_p^2 c^2 - m_t m_p c^2\n$$\n$$\nE_{p,i} (m_p - m_t) = m_p c^2 (m_p - m_t)\n$$\n$$\n(E_{p,i} - m_p c^2)(m_p - m_t) = 0\n$$\n\n**7. Analyzing the Solution:**\nThis equation gives two possible conditions:\n1.  $m_p = m_t$\n2.  $E_{p,i} = m_p c^2$\n\nThe problem specifies a non-trivial collision, which means the projectile must be initially in motion. The total energy of the projectile is $E_{p,i} = \\gamma_p m_p c^2$, where $\\gamma_p = (1 - v_{p,i}^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor corresponding to its initial velocity $v_{p,i}$. For a moving particle, $v_{p,i} > 0$, which implies $\\gamma_p > 1$. Therefore, the initial energy of the projectile $E_{p,i}$ must be strictly greater than its rest energy $m_p c^2$.\n$$\nE_{p,i} = \\gamma_p m_p c^2 > m_p c^2\n$$\nThis means the term $(E_{p,i} - m_p c^2)$ is always non-zero (it's strictly positive).\nConsequently, the only way for the equation $(E_{p,i} - m_p c^2)(m_p - m_t) = 0$ to be satisfied for a non-trivial collision is if the other term is zero:\n$$\nm_p - m_t = 0 \\implies m_p = m_t\n$$\nThis shows that even in the relativistic case, the projectile can only be brought to rest if its mass is equal to the mass of the stationary target. The required mass ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{m_p}{m_t} = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "391440"}, {"introduction": "Beyond just \"what happens,\" physicists are deeply interested in \"where things go.\" For the elastic scattering of identical masses, non-relativistic physics predicts a simple and elegant 90-degree separation between the final velocities.

Center-of-Mass (CM) Frame Kinematics**\nIn the CM frame, the total energy is $E_{CM} = \\sqrt{s} = m\\sqrt{2(\\gamma+1)}$.\nSince the particles have equal mass, they share this energy equally. The energy of each particle in the CM frame is $E^* = E_{CM}/2 = m\\sqrt{(\\gamma+1)/2}$.\nWe can define a Lorentz factor $\\gamma^*$ for the particles in the CM frame, where $E^* = \\gamma^* m$.\n$$\\gamma^* = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma+1}{2}}$$\nThe corresponding speed in the CM frame, $\\beta^*$, is:\n$$\\beta^* = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{(\\gamma^*)^2}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma+1-2}{\\gamma+1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma+1}}$$\n\n**3. Velocity of the CM Frame**\nThe velocity of the CM frame relative to the lab frame, $\\beta_{CM}$, is given by the ratio of total momentum to total energy in the lab frame:\n$$\\beta_{CM} = \\frac{|\\vec{p}_{tot}|}{E_{tot}} = \\frac{p_{in}}{E_{in}+m} = \\frac{m\\sqrt{\\gamma^2-1}}{\\gamma m + m} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\gamma-1)(\\gamma+1)}}{\\gamma+1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma-1}{\\gamma+1}}$$\nWe see that $\\beta_{CM} = \\beta^*$. The corresponding Lorentz factor is $\\gamma_{CM} = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta_{CM}^2} = \\gamma^*$.\n\n**4. Lorentz Transformation of Scattering Angles**\nIn the CM frame, due to momentum conservation, the two particles scatter back-to-back. If the projectile scatters at an angle $\\chi$ relative to the incident direction, the target recoils at an angle $\\pi-\\chi$.\nThe lab frame angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ are related to the CM angle $\\chi$ by the Lorentz transformation for angles (velocity aberration formula):\n$$\\tan\\theta = \\frac{v^* \\sin\\chi}{\\gamma_{CM}(v^* \\cos\\chi + v_{CM})}$$\n$$\\tan\\phi = \\frac{v^* \\sin(\\pi-\\chi)}{\\gamma_{CM}(v^* \\cos(\\pi-\\chi) + v_{CM})} = \\frac{v^* \\sin\\chi}{\\gamma_{CM}(-v^* \\cos\\chi + v_{CM})}$$\nHere $v^*$ is the speed of particles in the CM frame ($\\beta^* c$) and $v_{CM}$ is the speed of the CM frame itself ($\\beta_{CM} c$). Since we found $\\beta^* = \\beta_{CM}$, we have $v^* = v_{CM}$.
