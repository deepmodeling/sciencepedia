This requires minimizing the left-hand side, $M^2c^4 - 2Mc^2E_1$. This in turn requires minimizing the right-hand side. Since energies $E_2$ and $E_3$ must be positive for a three-body decay, and the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta_{23})$ is always non-negative (ranging from 0 to 2), the minimum possible value for the entire right-hand side is zero.\n\nThis minimum is achieved when $(1-\\cos\\theta_{23}) = 0$, which implies $\\cos\\theta_{23} = 1$.
