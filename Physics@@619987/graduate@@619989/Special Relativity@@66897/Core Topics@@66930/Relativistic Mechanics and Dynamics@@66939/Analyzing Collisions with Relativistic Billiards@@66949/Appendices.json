After the collision, it is observed that the final kinetic energies of the two particles are equal. Furthermore, the angle between the final velocity vectors of the two particles is measured to be $\\theta = \\pi/3$.\n\nUsing the principles of special relativity, determine the required initial kinetic energy of the projectile, expressed as a multiple of its rest energy $mc^2$.", "solution": "Let the projectile be particle 1 and the target particle be particle 2. Both particles have the same rest mass $m$. The speed of light is $c$.\n\n**1. Conservation of Energy**\nThe total energy of a particle is the sum of its kinetic energy $K$ and its rest energy $mc^2$. So, $E = K + mc^2$.\nInitially, particle 1 has kinetic energy $K_1 = K$ and particle 2 is at rest, so $K_2=0$.\nThe total initial energy of the system is:\n$$E_{initial} = E_1 + E_2 = (K + mc^2) + mc^2 = K + 2mc^2$$\nAfter the collision, the particles have final kinetic energies $K_1'$ and $K_2'$. The problem states that these are equal, so let $K_1' = K_2' = K_f$.\nThe total final energy of the system is:\n$$E_{final} = E_1' + E_2' = (K_f + mc^2) + (K_f + mc^2) = 2K_f + 2mc^2$$\nBy the principle of conservation of energy, $E_{initial} = E_{final}$:\n$$K + 2mc^2 = 2K_f + 2mc^2$$\nThis gives a simple relationship between the initial and final kinetic energies:\n$$K = 2K_f$$\n\n**2. Energy-Momentum Relation**\nThe relationship between a particle's total energy $E$, momentum magnitude $p$, and rest mass $m$ is given by $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$. We can express the momentum in terms of the kinetic energy $K$:\n$$(K + mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$\n$$K^2 + 2Kmc^2 + (mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$\n$$(pc)^2 = K^2 + 2Kmc^2 = K(K + 2mc^2)$$\n\n**3. Conservation of Momentum**\nLet $\\vec{p}_1$ be the initial momentum of the projectile, and $\\vec{p}_1'$ and $\\vec{p}_2'$ be the final momenta of the two particles. The target is initially at rest, so $\\vec{p}_2 = \\vec{0}$.\nConservation of momentum states:\n$$\\vec{p}_1 = \\vec{p}_1' + \\vec{p}_2'$$\nWe can square this vector equation (by taking the dot product with itself):\n$$\\vec{p}_1 \\cdot \\vec{p}_1 = (\\vec{p}_1' + \\vec{p}_2') \\cdot (\\vec{p}_1' + \\vec{p}_2')$$\n$$p_1^2 = p_1'^2 + p_2'^2 + 2\\vec{p}_1' \\cdot \\vec{p}_2'$$\nThe angle between the final velocity vectors is given as $\\theta = \\pi/3$. Therefore, $\\vec{p}_1' \\cdot \\vec{p}_2' = p_1' p_2' \\cos\\theta$. The equation becomes:\n$$p_1^2 = p_1'^2 + p_2'^2 + 2p_1' p_2' \\cos\\theta$$\n\n**4. Combining the Relations**\nSince the final kinetic energies are equal ($K_1' = K_2' = K_f$), the magnitudes of their final momenta must also be equal. Let $p_1' = p_2' = p_f$. The momentum conservation equation simplifies to:\n$$p_1^2 = p_f^2 + p_f^2 + 2p_f^2 \\cos\\theta = 2p_f^2 (1 + \\cos\\theta)$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for momentum in terms of kinetic energy.\nFor the initial particle (with kinetic energy $K$):\n$$p_1^2 c^2 = K(K + 2mc^2)$$\nFor the final particles (with kinetic energy $K_f = K/2$):\n$$p_f^2 c^2 = K_f(K_f + 2mc^2) = \\frac{K}{2}\\left(\\frac{K}{2} + 2mc^2\\right)$$\nSubstituting these into the momentum equation (multiplied by $c^2$):\n$$K(K + 2mc^2) = 2 \\left[ \\frac{K}{2}\\left(\\frac{K}{2} + 2mc^2\\right) \\right] (1 + \\cos\\theta)$$\nAssuming $K \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $K$:\n$$K + 2mc^2 = \\left(\\frac{K}{2} + 2mc^2\\right) (1 + \\cos\\theta)$$\nWe are given $\\theta = \\pi/3$, so $\\cos\\theta = 1/2$.\n$$K + 2mc^2 = \\left(\\frac{K}{2} + 2mc^2\\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$K + 2mc^2 = \\left(\\frac{K}{2} + 2mc^2\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$$\nNow, we solve for $K$:\n$$K + 2mc^2 = \\frac{3K}{4} + 3mc^2$$\n$$K - \\frac{3K}{4} = 3mc^2 - 2mc^2$$\n$$\\frac{K}{4} = mc^2$$\n$$K = 4mc^2$$\nThe problem asks for the kinetic energy as a multiple of the rest energy, which is the value of $K/(mc^2)$.\n$$\\frac{K}{mc^2} = 4$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{4} $$", "id": "377968"}, {"introduction": "Building on the fundamentals, we now move from a specific scenario to a more general and powerful analysis.
