This practice [@problem_id:415600] explores this crucial distinction through the classic example of a speeding square viewed edge-on. You will discover that instead of appearing as a flattened line, the square appears rotated, a phenomenon known as Terrell-Penrose rotation.", "problem": "A thin, flat square of side length $L$ lies in the $x'z'$ plane of its rest frame, S'. The square is centered at the origin of S', and its sides are parallel to the $x'$ and $z'$ axes. The frame S' moves with a constant relativistic velocity $\\vec{v} = (v, 0, 0)$ with respect to the laboratory frame S.\n\nAn observer is located very far away on the positive y-axis of the laboratory frame S. The observer views the square at the moment it appears to be at its closest approach, which occurs when its center is observed to be on the y-axis.

The key to solving problems of visual appearance for rapidly moving objects is to consider that light from different parts of the object takes different amounts of time to reach the observer. A powerful method to handle this is the Penrose-Terrell formalism.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the viewing direction in the square's rest frame S'**\n\nThe observer is located at $(0, D, 0)$ in the lab frame S, with $D \\to \\infty$. The light rays reaching the observer from the square are all essentially traveling parallel to the negative y-axis. The direction of these incoming light rays in frame S is given by the unit vector $\\vec{n} = (0, -1, 0)$.\n\nWe need to find the direction of these rays, $\\vec{n}'$, in the square's rest frame S'. The frames are related by a Lorentz boost along the x-axis with velocity $v$. The relativistic aberration formula transforms the direction vector $\\vec{n}=(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ to $\\vec{n}'=(n'_x, n'_y, n'_z)$:\n$$ n'_x = \\frac{n_x - \\beta}{1 - \\beta n_x} $$\n$$ n'_y = \\frac{n_y}{\\gamma(1 - \\beta n_x)} $$\n$$ n'_z = \\frac{n_z}{\\gamma(1 - \\beta n_x)} $$\nwhere $\\beta = v/c$ and $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$.\n\nSubstituting $n_x=0$, $n_y=-1$, $n_z=0$:\n$$ n'_x = \\frac{0 - \\beta}{1 - 0} = -\\beta $$\n$$ n'_y = \\frac{-1}{\\gamma(1 - 0)} = -\\frac{1}{\\gamma} $$\n$$ n'_z = \\frac{0}{\\gamma(1 - 0)} = 0 $$\nSo, in the rest frame S', the observer is effectively viewing the square via a parallel beam of light coming from the direction $\\vec{n}' = (-\\beta, -1/\\gamma, 0)$. The line of sight vector in S' is $\\vec{k}' = -\\vec{n}' = (\\beta, 1/\\gamma, 0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the apparent shape of the square**\n\nThe apparent shape seen by the distant observer is the orthographic projection of the square onto a plane perpendicular to the viewing direction $\\vec{k}' = (\\beta, 1/\\gamma, 0)$. Let's call this the \"screen plane\".\n\nWe define an orthonormal basis $(\\vec{e}_u, \\vec{e}_w)$ for this screen plane. The viewing direction $\\vec{k}'$ has no $z'$-component, so we can conveniently align one of our screen axes with the $z'$-axis:\n$$ \\vec{e}_w = (0, 0, 1) $$\nThe other basis vector, $\\vec{e}_u$, must be orthogonal to both $\\vec{e}_w$ and $\\vec{k}'$. We can find it using the cross product. Note that $|\\vec{k}'|^2 = \\beta^2 + (1/\\gamma)^2 = v^2/c^2 + (1-v^2/c^2) = 1$, so $\\vec{k}'$ is a unit vector.\n$$ \\vec{e}_u = \\vec{e}_w \\times \\vec{k}' = (0, 0, 1) \\times (\\beta, 1/\\gamma, 0) = (-1/\\gamma, \\beta, 0) $$\nThis vector is also a unit vector since $|(-1/\\gamma, \\beta, 0)|^2 = 1/\\gamma^2 + \\beta^2 = 1$.\n\nThe vertices of the square in its rest frame S' are:\n$A = (L/2, 0, L/2)$\n$B = (-L/2, 0, L/2)$\n$C = (-L/2, 0, -L/2)$\n$D = (L/2, 0, -L/2)$\n\nThe apparent coordinates $(u, w)$ of any point $\\vec{P}'=(x', 0, z')$ on the square are found by projecting $\\vec{P}'$ onto our screen basis vectors:\n$$ u = \\vec{P}' \\cdot \\vec{e}_u = (x', 0, z') \\cdot (-1/\\gamma, \\beta, 0) = -x'/\\gamma $$\n$$ w = \\vec{P}' \\cdot \\vec{e}_w = (x', 0, z') \\cdot (0, 0, 1) = z' $$\n\nNow we find the apparent positions of the four vertices:\n$P_{A, app} = (u_A, w_A) = (-(L/2)/\\gamma, L/2) = (-L/(2\\gamma), L/2)$\n$P_{B, app} = (u_B, w_B) = (-(-L/2)/\\gamma, L/2) = (L/(2\\gamma), L/2)$\n$P_{C, app} = (u_C, w_C) = (-(-L/2)/\\gamma, -L/2) = (L/(2\\gamma), -L/2)$\n$P_{D, app} = (u_D, w_D) = (-(L/2)/\\gamma, -L/2) = (-L/(2\\gamma), -L/2)$\n\nThese four points form a rectangle in the apparent $(u,w)$ plane, with width $L/\\gamma$ (the Lorentz-contracted length) and height $L$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the angle between the diagonals of the apparent rectangle**\n\nThe diagonals of the apparent rectangle connect opposite corners. Let's find the vectors for these two diagonals.\nThe first diagonal connects $P_{A, app}$ and $P_{C, app}$.\n$$ \\vec{d}_1 = P_{C, app} - P_{A, app} = (L/(2\\gamma) - (-L/(2\\gamma)), -L/2 - L/2) = (L/\\gamma, -L) $$\nThe second diagonal connects $P_{B, app}$ and $P_{D, app}$.\n$$ \\vec{d}_2 = P_{D, app} - P_{B, app} = (-L/(2\\gamma) - L/(2\\gamma), -L/2 - L/2) = (-L/\\gamma, -L) $$\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ between these two vectors is given by the dot product formula: $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\vec{d}_1 \\cdot \\vec{d}_2}{|\\vec{d}_1||\\vec{d}_2|}$.\n\nCalculate the dot product:\n$$ \\vec{d}_1 \\cdot \\vec{d}_2 = (L/\\gamma)(-L/\\gamma) + (-L)(-L) = -L^2/\\gamma^2 + L^2 = L^2(1 - 1/\\gamma^2) $$\nUsing the definition $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1-\\beta^2}$, we have $1/\\gamma^2 = 1-\\beta^2$.\n$$ \\vec{d}_1 \\cdot \\vec{d}_2 = L^2(1 - (1-\\beta^2)) = L^2\\beta^2 $$\n\nCalculate the magnitudes of the diagonal vectors:\n$$ |\\vec{d}_1|^2 = (L/\\gamma)^2 + (-L)^2 = L^2(1/\\gamma^2 + 1) $$\n$$ |\\vec{d}_2|^2 = (-L/\\gamma)^2 + (-L)^2 = L^2(1/\\gamma^2 + 1) $$\nSo, $|\\vec{d}_1| |\\vec{d}_2| = L^2(1/\\gamma^2 + 1)$.\n\nNow compute $\\cos\\theta$:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{L^2\\beta^2}{L^2(1/\\gamma^2 + 1)} = \\frac{\\beta^2}{1/\\gamma^2 + 1} $$\nSubstitute $1/\\gamma^2 = 1-\\beta^2$:\n$$ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\beta^2}{(1-\\beta^2) + 1} = \\frac{\\beta^2}{2-\\beta^2} $$\nThis is the cosine of the apparent angle between the diagonals.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\beta^2}{2-\\beta^2}} $$", "id": "415600"}, {"introduction": "To build a more intuitive grasp of how relativistic visual distortions occur, it is helpful to directly calculate the path of light rays from the object to the observer.

Let the torus move along the z-axis with velocity $\\vec{v} = (0, 0, v)$. For simplicity, we can set the center of the torus to pass through the origin at $t=0$. The world line of the center of the torus is $(0, 0, vt)$.\n\nIn the co-moving rest frame S' of the torus, its surface is described by the equation:\n$$ (\\sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2} - R)^2 + (z')^2 = r^2 $$\nLet $\\rho' = \\sqrt{(x')^2 + (y')^2}$.
