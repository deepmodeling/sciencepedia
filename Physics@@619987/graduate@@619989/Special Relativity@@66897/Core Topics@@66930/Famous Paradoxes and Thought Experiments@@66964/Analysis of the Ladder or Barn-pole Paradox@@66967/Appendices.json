This first exercise invites you to determine the conditions under which the paradox seems possible from the perspective of an observer in the barn. By analyzing a specific hypothetical mechanism involving a light signal, you will calculate the minimum speed $v$ a ladder must have to be physically contained within the barn at a specific moment, setting the stage for the apparent contradiction [@problem_id:376764].", "problem": "A ladder, of proper length $L_0$, travels at a constant relativistic speed $v$. It moves along the axis of a barn, of proper length $L_B$. The barn has a back door and a front door. In the barn's rest frame, the back door is at position $x=0$ and the front door is at $x=L_B$. The ladder travels in the positive $x$ direction.\n\nA mechanism is set up to try and trap the ladder. When the front tip of the ladder reaches the back door ($x=0$), a light signal is sent from the back door to the front door. The front door is rigged to close instantly upon the arrival of this signal. The back door can also be closed.\n\nThe ladder is considered \"trapped\" if, at the instant the front door closes, the entire ladder is spatially located between the two doors (i.e., its rear end has passed the back door, and its front end has not yet passed the front door).\n\nCalculate the minimum speed $v_{min}$ the ladder must have to be trapped.

In the barn frame the moving ladder has contracted length  \n$$L=\\frac{L_0}{\\gamma},\\quad \\gamma=\\frac1{\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}\\,. $$\n\n2.

The ladder is trapped if at $t_1$ the rear has already entered ($t_{\\rm rear}<t_1$) and the front has not yet exited ($v\\,t_1<L_B$).  The second condition $v\\,L_B/c<L_B$ is automatic for $v<c$.

This practice explores the core of the paradox's resolution—the relativity of simultaneity—viewed through clocks synchronized in the ladder's own rest frame. You will calculate the time registered on a clock at the rear of the ladder, providing a quantitative demonstration of why events that are simultaneous in one frame are not in another [@problem_id:376757].", "problem": "A pole of proper length $L_p$ travels at a constant relativistic velocity $\\vec{v}$ along the x-axis of a laboratory frame $S$. In this frame, a barn of proper length $L_b$ is at rest, with its front door located at $x=0$ and its back door at $x=L_b$.\n\nTwo clocks, $C_F$ and $C_R$, are attached to the front and rear ends of the pole, respectively. These clocks are perfectly synchronized in the pole's rest frame, $S'$. The synchronization is established such that the clock $C_F$ at the front of the pole reads $t'_F = 0$ at the exact moment the front of the pole passes the front door of the barn. This meeting of the pole's front and the barn's front door is designated as Event A.\n\nA second event, Event B, occurs when the rear of the pole passes the back door of the barn.\n\nDetermine the time registered on the rear clock, $C_R$, at the moment Event B occurs. Express your answer in terms of $L_p$, $L_b$, $v$, and the speed of light $c$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the reading on a clock in the pole's rest frame, $S'$. It is therefore most straightforward to analyze the situation from the perspective of this frame.\n\n1.  **Establish the Coordinate System and Setup in Frame $S'$**\n\nIn the pole's rest frame, $S'$, the pole is stationary. Let's place the front of the pole, where clock $C_F$ is located, at the origin, $x'_F = 0$. The rear of the pole, where clock $C_R$ is located, is then at $x'_R = -L_p$.\n\nThe barn is moving with velocity $-v$ along the x'-axis. Due to Lorentz contraction, the length of the barn as measured in the pole's frame $S'$ is not its proper length $L_b$, but rather the contracted length $L'_b$:\n$$L'_b = \\frac{L_b}{\\gamma} = L_b\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$\nwhere $\\gamma = (1 - v^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$ is the Lorentz factor.\n\n2.  **Define Event A in Frame $S'$**\n\nEvent A is the moment the front of the pole meets the front door of the barn. In frame $S'$, this occurs at the position of the pole's front, $x'_A = x'_F = 0$. The problem states that the clock at the front of the pole, $C_F$, reads $t'_F=0$ at this event. Since all clocks in the pole's frame are synchronized, the time of Event A in frame $S'$ is $t'_A = 0$. Thus, the spacetime coordinates of Event A are $(t'_A, x'_A) = (0, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Position of the Barn's Doors in Frame $S'$**\n\nSince the barn moves with velocity $-v$ in the $S'$ frame, and its front door is at $x'=0$ at $t'=0$ (Event A), the position of its front door at any time $t'$ is given by:\n$$x'_{barn, F}(t') = -vt'$$\nThe back door of the barn is always a distance $L'_b$ ahead of the front door (in the positive x' direction, as the barn moves towards negative x'). So, the position of the back door is:\n$$x'_{barn, R}(t') = x'_{barn, F}(t') + L'_b = -vt' + \\frac{L_b}{\\gamma}$$\n\n4.  **Define and Analyze Event B in Frame $S'$**\n\nEvent B is the moment the rear of the pole meets the back door of the barn. In frame $S'$, the rear of the pole is permanently at $x'_R = -L_p$. Therefore, Event B occurs at the time $t'_B$ when the position of the barn's back door is equal to the position of the pole's rear.\n$$x'_{barn, R}(t'_B) = x'_R$$\n$$-vt'_B + \\frac{L_b}{\\gamma} = -L_p$$\n\n5.  **Solve for the Time of Event B ($t'_B$)**\n\nWe rearrange the equation to solve for $t'_B$:\n$$vt'_B = L_p + \\frac{L_b}{\\gamma}$$\n$$t'_B = \\frac{L_p}{v} + \\frac{L_b}{v\\gamma}$$\nThis time, $t'_B$, is the time coordinate of Event B in the pole's frame $S'$.\n\n6.  **Interpret the Result**\n\nThe clocks $C_F$ and $C_R$ are stationary and synchronized in frame $S'$. The reading of any such clock at a spacetime event $(t', x')$ is simply $t'$. Event B occurs at the spatial location of the rear clock, $C_R$. Therefore, the reading on clock $C_R$ at Event B is precisely $t'_B$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\gamma$, we get the final answer:\n$$t'_B = \\frac{L_p}{v} + \\frac{L_b}{v} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{L_p}{v} + \\frac{L_b}{v} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$", "id": "376757"}, {"introduction": "To solidify our understanding, this final practice uses light signals—the ultimate measuring tool in relativity—to probe the moving ladder from the barn's center.

The event where the center of the pole spatially coincides with the center of the barn (the location of the emitter-detector) is defined as the origin $(x, t) = (0, 0)$ in the barn's rest frame S, and $(x', t') = (0, 0)$ in the pole's rest frame S'.\n\nAt this origin event $(t=t'=0)$, the device at the center of the barn emits a flash of light. This light travels outwards, reflects off the front and back ends of the moving pole, and the reflected signals travel back to the detector at the center of thebarn.\n\nCalculate the time interval $\\Delta t'$ between the arrival of the two reflected signals (one from the front end and one from the back end of the pole) at the detector, as measured by a clock at rest in the pole's frame S'.
