This first exercise invites you to explore one of its most profound consequences: the relationship between energy and gravitational mass. By analyzing a simple thought experiment involving a photon in a freely-falling box—a scenario equivalent to an inertial frame—you will use basic conservation laws to demonstrate that energy itself must gravitate, a cornerstone concept encapsulated in the famous equation $E = mc^2$ [@problem_id:411269]. This practice deepens your understanding of mass-energy equivalence and its role in gravitational physics.", "problem": "A rigid, hollow box of height $h$ and total initial rest mass $M$ is in a state of free fall within a uniform gravitational field. According to the principle of equivalence, the physics inside this box is equivalent to that in an inertial reference frame in the absence of gravity.\n\nAn experiment is performed inside this isolated box. From a source located at the geometric center of an otherwise featureless ceiling, a single photon of energy $E$ is emitted. The photon is directed towards the floor at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the vertical axis of the box. The photon travels across the box and is eventually completely absorbed by the floor.\n\nAssuming the box does not lose any energy to its surroundings (e.g., as heat), calculate the exact total vertical displacement, $\\Delta y$, of the box's center of mass. Your calculation should run from the instant of photon emission to the instant of photon absorption. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters $M$, $h$, $E$, $\\theta$, and the speed of light $c$.", "solution": "1. A photon with energy $E$ has a momentum of magnitude $p=E/c$.

Importantly, after emitting the photon, the box's mass is reduced to $M' = M - E/c^2$.
