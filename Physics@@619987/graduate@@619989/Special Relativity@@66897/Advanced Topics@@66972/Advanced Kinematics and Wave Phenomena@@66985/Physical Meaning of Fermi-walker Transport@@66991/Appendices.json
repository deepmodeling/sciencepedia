Fermi-Walker Transport of the Spin Vector**\n\nThe spin 4-vector $S^\\mu$ is initially perpendicular to the direction of motion (the x-axis). We can choose the initial spin to be along the y-axis in the laboratory frame, so $S^\\mu(0) = (0, 0, s, 0)$ for some magnitude $s$.

To find this, we transform the lab-frame 4-vector $S^\\mu$ to the instantaneous comoving rest frame. This is done by applying a Lorentz boost in the $-x$ direction.\nThe spin vector $S^\\mu$ has only a $y$-component. A Lorentz boost along the x-axis leaves the transverse components ($y$ and $z$) unchanged.\nTherefore, the spin 4-vector in the rest frame, $S'^\\alpha$, is:\n$$ S'^\\alpha = (0, 0, s, 0) $$\nThe spatial part of this vector gives the 3-spin vector $\\vec{s}'$ in the rest frame:\n$$ \\vec{s}' = (0, s, 0) $$\nThis result is independent of time. The direction of the spin vector in the particle's rest frame does not change during the deceleration.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nSince the direction of the spin vector in the particle's rest frame remains constant throughout the motion, the total angle of precession is zero. Thomas precession only occurs when the direction of acceleration changes, causing the sequence of infinitesimal boosts to be non-collinear. For purely linear motion, there is no precession.\n\nThe total precession angle is $\\Delta\\Theta = 0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "397386"}]}
