Because electromagnetic interactions travel at the finite speed of light $c$, the fields you observe at a point $\\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$ are determined not by the charge's present state, but by its state at an earlier, or 'retarded', time $t_r$. This first practice [@problem_id:393466] will guide you through the essential skill of solving the implicit equation for $t_r$ in a scenario involving non-uniform motion, laying the mathematical groundwork for all that follows.", "problem": "In classical electrodynamics, the potentials at an observation point $\\mathbf{r}$ and time $t$ due to a point charge $q$ moving along a trajectory $\\mathbf{w}(t')$ are determined by the charge's state at the retarded time $t_r$. The retarded time is defined implicitly by the relation $c(t - t_r) = |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{w}(t_r)|$, which signifies that the time delay $t - t_r$ corresponds to the light-travel time from the charge's position at $t_r$ to the observer's position $\\mathbf{r}$.\n\nConsider a point charge that starts from rest at the origin at time $t'=0$ and subsequently moves along the positive $z$-axis. Its speed for $t' \\ge 0$ is given by $v(t') = at'$, where $a$ is a positive constant. Consequently, the trajectory of the charge is $\\mathbf{w}(t') = \\frac{1}{2}at'^2 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. An observer is located at a fixed point on the axis of motion, $\\mathbf{r} = Z\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $Z>0$.\n\nDetermine the retarded time $t_r$ for an observation made at time $t$. For simplicity, you may assume that the physical parameters ($t$, $Z$, $a$, $c$) are such that at the retarded time $t_r$, the charge has not yet reached the observer's position. Furthermore, assume the parameters allow for a physical (real and causal) solution for $t_r$ to exist.", "solution": "The retarded time $t_r$ is determined by the condition that a light signal emitted by the charge at time $t_r$ from position $\\mathbf{w}(t_r)$ arrives at the observer's position $\\mathbf{r}$ at time $t$.

This means $\\frac{1}{2}at_r^2  Z$, so the term inside the absolute value is positive. We can therefore drop the absolute value sign:\n$$|\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{w}(t_r)| = Z - \\frac{1}{2}at_r^2$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the retarded time equation gives:\n$$c(t - t_r) = Z - \\frac{1}{2}at_r^2$$\n\nThis is an equation for $t_r$.

To determine the physically correct one, we must select the root that corresponds to a sensible physical limit. Let's consider the non-accelerating limit, where $a \\to 0$. In this case, the charge remains at the origin. The retarded time should simply be $t_r = t - Z/c$, representing the light travel time from the origin to the point $Z$.\n\nLet's examine the two roots in this limit:\n$$t_{r,+} = \\frac{c + \\sqrt{c^2 - 2a(ct - Z)}}{a}$$\nAs $a \\to 0$, the numerator approaches $2c$ while the denominator approaches $0$.

We can evaluate the limit using a Taylor expansion for the square root. Let $\\epsilon = \\frac{2a(ct-Z)}{c^2}$. The expression becomes:\n$$t_{r,-} = \\frac{c - c\\sqrt{1-\\epsilon}}{a} = \\frac{c}{a}(1 - \\sqrt{1-\\epsilon})$$\nFor small $\\epsilon$, we use the binomial approximation $\\sqrt{1-\\epsilon} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon$.\n$$t_{r,-} \\approx \\frac{c}{a}\\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon\\right)\\right) = \\frac{c}{a}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon\\right)$$\nSubstituting back the expression for $\\epsilon$:\n$$t_{r,-} \\approx \\frac{c}{2a} \\left(\\frac{2a(ct-Z)}{c^2}\\right) = \\frac{ct-Z}{c} = t - \\frac{Z}{c}$$\nThis matches the expected result for a stationary charge at the origin. Therefore, the negative root is the physically correct solution.\n\nThe problem statement guarantees that a real solution exists, which means the term under the square root is non-negative: $c^2 - 2a(ct - Z) \\ge 0$.\n\nThe final expression for the retarded time is:\n$$t_r = \\frac{c - \\sqrt{c^2 - 2a(ct-Z)}}{a}$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{t_r = \\frac{c - \\sqrt{c^2 - 2a(ct - Z)}}{a}} $$", "id": "393466"}, {"introduction": "With the ability to calculate retarded time, we can now compute the full electromagnetic field using the Liénard-Wiechert formulas.
