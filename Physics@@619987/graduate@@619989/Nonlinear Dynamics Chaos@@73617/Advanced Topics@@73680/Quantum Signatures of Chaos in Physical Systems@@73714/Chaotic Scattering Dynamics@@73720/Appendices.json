It consists of three identical, non-overlapping circular disks fixed in a plane, with their centers forming an equilateral triangle. A point particle moves freely in the plane and undergoes elastic collisions with the disks.\n\nThe trajectory of the particle can be encoded using symbolic dynamics. We label the disks as 1, 2, and 3. A trajectory is represented by the infinite sequence of labels of the disks it collides with, e.g., $...s_{i-1} s_i s_{i+1}...$, where $s_k \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nFor a particle to scatter between the disks, not all symbol sequences are physically possible. A key constraint is the *admissibility condition*: a particle cannot collide with the same disk twice in a row. This means that for any valid trajectory, the corresponding symbol sequence must satisfy $s_i \\neq s_{i+1}$ for all consecutive collisions $i$ and $i+1$. We assume that for the given geometry of the disks, any sequence satisfying this condition corresponds to a real physical trajectory.\n\nA *periodic orbit* of symbolic length $n$ is a repeating sequence of collisions, written as a finite sequence of symbols $S = s_1 s_2 ... s_n$, with the understanding that the pattern repeats indefinitely ($s_{n+k} = s_k$). This requires that the admissibility condition holds cyclically, i.e., $s_i \\neq s_{i+1}$ for $i=1, ..., n-1$, and also $s_n \\neq s_1$.\n\nA periodic orbit $S$ is called a *prime periodic orbit* (or primitive orbit) if it is not a repetition of a shorter periodic orbit. For example, the sequence `123123` represents a periodic orbit of length 6, but it is not prime because it consists of two repetitions of the prime orbit `123`.

The rate of this escape is fundamentally linked to the invariant probability density of the corresponding closed system, which describes where a trajectory is most likely to be found over long times.

The intricate, self-similar geometry of these boundaries is not just a curiosity; its fractal dimension is quantitatively determined by the dynamical properties of the chaotic saddle.

The fixed charges are separated by a distance $L$. This system exhibits chaotic scattering. The set of initial conditions that separate qualitatively different scattering outcomes (e.g., scattering to the left versus scattering to the right) forms a fractal basin boundary in the phase space.\n\nThe structure of this fractal boundary is determined by the properties of the chaotic saddle, which is the set of all bounded, non-escaping orbits. This saddle is composed of a countably infinite set of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs). For a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom, the fractal dimension $D$ of the basin boundary (intersected with a 1D line of initial conditions) is given by the Kantz-Grassberger formula, $D = 1 - \\kappa/\\lambda$, where $\\kappa$ is the escape rate and $\\lambda$ is the positive Lyapunov exponent. For this problem, we will use the topological entropy $h_T$ as an approximation for the escape rate ($\\kappa \\approx h_T$).\n\nThe stability of a UPO with period $T$ is determined by its monodromy matrix $M$. For a 2D Hamiltonian system, the stability transverse to the orbit can be described by a 2$\\times$2 symplectic matrix $M$.

Under the assumption that $\\kappa \\approx h_T$, the formula for the dimension is:\n$$\nD = 1 - \\frac{h_T}{\\lambda}\n$$\nWe are given the topological entropy $h_T$, but we need to determine the positive Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda$ from the other given parameters, namely the period $T$ and the trace of the monodromy matrix $S = \\operatorname{Tr}(M)$.\n\nThe Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda$ is related to the largest eigenvalue (in magnitude) of the monodromy matrix, $\\Lambda$, by the formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{T} \\ln\\Lambda\n$$\nWe need to find $\\Lambda$.

This implies $S^2 > 4$, so the term under the square root is positive.\n\nThe problem states that $\\Lambda$ is the eigenvalue with magnitude greater than 1. Let's analyze the two roots. The product of the roots is $(\\frac{S + \\sqrt{S^2-4}}{2})(\\frac{S - \\sqrt{S^2-4}}{2}) = \\frac{S^2 - (S^2-4)}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$, confirming they are a reciprocal pair. Since $S > 2$, $\\sqrt{S^2-4} > 0$. Therefore, the root with the plus sign is greater than the root with the minus sign. The sum of the roots is $S > 2$. If one root were less than 1, the other must be greater than 1 to have their product equal to 1. The root $\\frac{S+\\sqrt{S^2-4}}{2}$ is clearly greater than 1. For example, if $S$ is slightly larger than 2, say $2+\\epsilon$, $\\sqrt{S^2-4} = \\sqrt{(2+\\epsilon)^2-4} = \\sqrt{4\\epsilon+\\epsilon^2}>0$. So $\\Lambda = \\frac{S+\\sqrt{S^2-4}}{2} > \\frac{S}{2} > 1$.\nSo, we must choose the positive sign to get the eigenvalue $\\Lambda > 1$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{S + \\sqrt{S^2 - 4}}{2}\n$$\nNow we can calculate the Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{T} \\ln\\Lambda = \\frac{1}{T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{S + \\sqrt{S^2 - 4}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThe expression $\\ln\\left(\\frac{S + \\sqrt{S^2 - 4}}{2}\\right)$ is also known as the inverse hyperbolic cosine, $\\operatorname{arccosh}(S/2)$.
