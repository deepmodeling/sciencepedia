The dynamics of the particle's wavefunction amplitude at site $n$, denoted by $\\psi_n$, is governed by the time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n$$E \\psi_n = V_n \\psi_n + t (\\psi_{n+1} + \\psi_{n-1})$$\nwhere $E$ is the energy of the particle, $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude, and $V_n$ is the on-site potential.\n\nThe on-site potential is periodic with a period of two sites, creating a \"dimer\" structure. Specifically, the potential alternates between two values: $V_n = -\\epsilon$ for even-numbered sites ($n=2k$) and $V_n = \\epsilon$ for odd-numbered sites ($n=2k+1$), where $k$ is an integer and $\\epsilon$ is a positive energy scale.\n\nThe evolution of the wavefunction along the chain can be described using a transfer matrix formalism. The Schrödinger equation can be rearranged into a matrix form that connects the wavefunction amplitudes across adjacent sites:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\psi_{n+1} \\\\ \\psi_n \\end{pmatrix} = M_n \\begin{pmatrix} \\psi_n \\\\ \\psi_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $M_n$ is the transfer matrix for site $n$.\n\nFor a system with a periodic potential, the existence of extended, non-decaying states (Bloch waves) is restricted to specific energy bands. These bands are determined by the properties of the transfer matrix over a single period of the potential, $T_2 = M_{2k+1} M_{2k}$. Extended states are possible only for energies $E$ where the eigenvalues of $T_2$ have a modulus of 1.

You will use the elegant concept of self-duality to precisely determine the critical point at which all eigenstates in the system simultaneously transition from being extended to being localized [@problem_id:888739].", "problem": "The one-dimensional Aubry-André model is a cornerstone for understanding the localization of quantum particles in quasiperiodic potentials.

This model famously exhibits a sharp localization transition: for a given ratio of potential strength to hopping amplitude, all eigenstates are either extended (like Bloch waves) or exponentially localized.\n\nThis transition can be precisely located using the model's self-duality property. A Fourier transform maps the real-space equation for $\\psi_n$ into a similar-looking equation in momentum space for its Fourier coefficients, $c_k$. This dual equation describes a particle on a dual lattice with effective parameters $\\tilde{t}$ and $\\tilde{V}$.\n\nLet the dimensionless coupling for the model be $g = V/t$. The system is in a localized phase for $g > g_c$ and an extended phase for $g < g_c$. The duality mapping relates a model with coupling $g$ to a dual model with coupling $\\tilde{g}$. A key consequence of this duality is that localized states in the original model correspond to extended states in the dual, and vice-versa. At the critical point $g_c$, the model must be self-dual, meaning its physical properties are invariant under the duality transformation. This implies the dimensionless coupling must be a fixed point of the transformation, i.e., $g_c = \\tilde{g}(g_c)$.\n\nYour task is to find the value of the critical coupling $g_c=V/t$. To do this, first derive the dual Schrödinger equation by applying a Fourier transform to the original equation. Then, by identifying the dual hopping amplitude $\\tilde{t}$ and dual potential strength $\\tilde{V}$, find the relationship between $g$ and $\\tilde{g}$.
