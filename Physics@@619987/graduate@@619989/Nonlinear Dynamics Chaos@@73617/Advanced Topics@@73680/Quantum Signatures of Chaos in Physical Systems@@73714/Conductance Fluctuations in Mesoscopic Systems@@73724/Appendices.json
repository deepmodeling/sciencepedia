This exercise explores the competition between two key types of current fluctuations: thermal noise, arising from the random thermal motion of electrons, and shot noise, a quantum effect originating from the discreteness of charge. By calculating the crossover voltage in a simple quantum point contact, you will develop a quantitative feel for the conditions under which each noise source becomes dominant [@problem_id:861412].", "problem": "A quantum point contact (QPC) is a narrow constriction between two wider electron reservoirs, acting as a ballistic one-dimensional waveguide for electrons. Consider a QPC at a finite temperature $T$ with a voltage bias $V$ applied across it. The system is modeled as a single spin-polarized electronic channel, where electrons can transmit through the constriction with a probability $\\mathcal{T}$, which is assumed to be independent of energy over the relevant energy scale. The conductance of this single channel is given by $G = \\frac{e^2}{h}\\mathcal{T}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\nAt finite temperature and bias, the current flowing through the QPC exhibits fluctuations, or noise. We consider two fundamental contributions to this noise:\n\n1.  **Thermal Noise (Johnson-Nyquist Noise):** This is the equilibrium noise present at zero bias ($V=0$) due to the thermal agitation of charge carriers. The power spectral density of the thermal current fluctuations is given by:\n    $$ S_{I, \\text{th}} = 4k_B T G $$\n    where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Shot Noise:** This is a non-equilibrium noise source arising from the discreteness of the charge carriers. In the limit of zero temperature ($T=0$), the power spectral density of the shot noise is given by:\n    $$ S_{I, \\text{shot}} = 2e|I|F $$\n    where $I=GV$ is the average current and $F$ is the Fano factor, which quantifies the suppression of noise relative to the classical Poissonian value ($F=1$). For a single channel in a QPC, the Fano factor is $F = 1 - \\mathcal{T}$.\n\nDetermine the crossover bias voltage $V_c > 0$ at which the magnitude of the zero-temperature shot noise equals the magnitude of the zero-bias thermal noise.

Consider a single strong scatterer located at position $\\mathbf{R}$ inside the conductor, which is then displaced by a small amount $\\delta\\mathbf{R}$. The change in the microscopic potential landscape alters the quantum interference of electron paths, leading to a change in conductance.\n\nThe decay of conductance correlations is characterized by the correlation function $C(\\delta \\mathbf{R}) = \\langle \\delta g(\\mathbf{R})\\delta g(\\mathbf{R}+\\delta \\mathbf{R}) \\rangle$, where $\\delta g(\\mathbf{R}) = g(\\mathbf{R}) - \\langle g \\rangle$ is the conductance fluctuation when the scatterer is at $\\mathbf{R}$, and $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ denotes an average over the configurations of all other (background) scatterers.\n\nA simplified model for this decorrelation is based on the phase shift acquired by electrons that scatter off the displaced impurity.
