Lead 1 supports $N_1$ propagating modes (channels) and lead 2 supports $N_2$ propagating modes. The total scattering process is described by an $N \\times N$ scattering matrix $S$, where $N=N_1+N_2$. Due to the chaotic nature of the cavity, $S$ can be modeled as a random matrix drawn from the Circular Unitary Ensemble (CUE) of $N \\times N$ unitary matrices.\n\nThe S-matrix is partitioned into blocks corresponding to reflection and transmission between the leads:\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix} r & t' \\\\ t & r' \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $r$ is the $N_1 \\times N_1$ reflection matrix for an incoming wave in lead 1, $t'$ is the $N_1 \\times N_2$ transmission matrix from lead 2 to lead 1, $t$ is the $N_2 \\times N_1$ transmission matrix from lead 1 to lead 2, and $r'$ is the $N_2 \\times N_2$ reflection matrix for lead 2.\n\nA \"perfectly reflecting mode\" for lead 1 is defined as an input state in lead 1 that is fully reflected back into lead 1, with zero transmission to lead 2.
