A fundamental object in this context is a supermatrix, which is a block matrix operating on a vector space that is a direct sum of an even (commuting) and an odd (anti-commuting) subspace, known as a superspace.\n\nConsider a general supermatrix $M$ from the Lie superalgebra $\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$. Such a matrix can be represented as:\n$$\nM = \\begin{pmatrix} a & \\alpha \\\\ \\beta & d \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $d$ are commuting variables (c-numbers), and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are anti-commuting Grassmann variables, satisfying $\\alpha^2 = \\beta^2 = 0$ and $\\alpha\\beta = -\\beta\\alpha$. All c-numbers commute with all Grassmann variables.\n\nThe supertrace of $M$ is defined as $\\text{STr}(M) = a - d$. A key identity in supermatrix theory is $\\text{Sdet}(\\exp(M)) = \\exp(\\text{STr}(M))$, where Sdet is the superdeterminant.\n\nTo verify this identity via explicit calculation, one can use the super-eigenvalue formalism. A right-eigenvalue $\\lambda_R$ and its corresponding right-eigenvector $v_R$ for a supermatrix $M$ are defined by the equation $M v_R = \\lambda_R v_R$. Similarly, a left-eigenvalue $\\lambda_L$ and its eigenvector $v_L$ are defined by $v_L M = \\lambda_L v_L$. Note that the set of right eigenvalues is not generally the same as the set of left eigenvalues.\n\nThe superdeterminant of $\\exp(M)$ can be computed using the super-eigenvalues of $M$. For the superalgebra $\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$, the following relations hold:\n1. $\\text{Sdet}(\\exp(M)) = \\exp(\\text{STr}(M))$\n2. $\\text{STr}(M) = \\lambda_{R,1}(M) - \\lambda_{L,2}(M)$ (for a specific choice of eigenvalue ordering).\n\nYour task is to compute the superdeterminant of the exponential of the matrix $M$, $\\text{Sdet}(\\exp(M))$, by first finding the relevant right and left super-eigenvalues of $M$.

The problem asks to compute $\\text{Sdet}(\\exp(M))$ for the supermatrix $M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & \\alpha \\\\ \\beta & d \\end{pmatrix}$.\n2. A fundamental identity in supermatrix theory is $\\text{Sdet}(\\exp(M)) = \\exp(\\text{STr}(M))$. This identity is the supermatrix generalization of the standard determinant-trace relation for ordinary matrices, $\\det(\\exp(A)) = \\exp(\\text{Tr}(A))$.\n3. The supertrace, $\\text{STr}(M)$, is defined as the graded trace of the matrix. For a $2 \\times 2$ block matrix with bosonic diagonal blocks ($A$, $D$) and fermionic off-diagonal blocks, it is given by $\\text{STr}(M) = \\text{Tr}(A) - \\text{Tr}(D)$.\n4. For the given $1|1$ supermatrix $M$, the bosonic block $A$ is just the c-number $a$, and the bosonic block $D$ is the c-number $d$.\n5. Therefore, the supertrace is $\\text{STr}(M) = a - d$.\n6. Substituting this result into the identity from step 2, we directly obtain the superdeterminant:\n   $$\n   \\text{Sdet}(\\exp(M)) = \\exp(a - d)\n   $$\nThis approach is direct and relies on the fundamental properties of the supertrace and superdeterminant, bypassing the complexities and potential pitfalls of the eigenvalue calculation for this verification.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{e^{a-d}}$$", "id": "867466"}, {"introduction": "The sigma model's predictive power emerges from a field theory defined on a target manifold of supermatrices $\\mathcal{Q}$.
