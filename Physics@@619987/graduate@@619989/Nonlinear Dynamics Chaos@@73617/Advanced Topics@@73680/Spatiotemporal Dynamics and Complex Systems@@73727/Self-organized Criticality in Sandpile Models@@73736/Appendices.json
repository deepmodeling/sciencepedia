Each site has an integer number of particles, denoted by a height $z_i$. A site $i$ becomes unstable and topples if its height $z_i$ reaches or exceeds a critical threshold, $z_c$. A toppling event at site $i$ consists of reducing its height by $z_c$ (i.e., $z_i \\to z_i - z_c$) and distributing the $z_c$ particles to its neighbors. In the stochastic Manna model, each of the $z_c$ particles is independently and randomly sent to one of the neighboring sites. An avalanche is a sequence of such topplings that continues until all sites are stable ($z_i < z_c$ for all $i$).\n\nConsider this model on a lattice with $L=5$ sites and open boundaries, where the critical threshold is $z_c=2$. The neighbors of a site $i$ are $i-1$ and $i+1$. Particles sent to sites $0$ or $L+1=6$ are removed from the system.\n\nAn avalanche is initiated by raising the height of site 3 to its critical value, $z_3=z_c$, starting from a configuration where site 3 has height $z_3=z_c-1=1$ and all other sites are empty ($z_i=0$ for $i \\ne 3$).\n\nCalculate the probability that this avalanche terminates after exactly two topplings.", "solution": "After the first toppling at site 3, the two particles are sent independently to sites 2 or 4 with probability $1/2$ each.

An unstable site $i$ topples, and its height is updated as $z_i \\to z_i - z_c$.\n2. The $z_c=2$ particles removed from site $i$ are transferred to its nearest neighbors. Specifically, they are sent one each to two *different* nearest-neighboring sites, chosen uniformly at random from all possible pairs of distinct neighbors.\n3.

The process continues until no sites are unstable. A key property of the ASM is that the final stable configuration is independent of the order in which unstable sites are toppled.\n\nThe set of recurrent (ergodic) configurations of the ASM forms a finite Abelian group, known as the sandpile group or the group of recurrents.
