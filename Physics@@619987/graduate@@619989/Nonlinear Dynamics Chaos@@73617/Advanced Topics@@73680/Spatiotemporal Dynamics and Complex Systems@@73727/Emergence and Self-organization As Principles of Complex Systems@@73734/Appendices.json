The system evolves in continuous time according to two distinct stochastic processes:\n\n1.  **Interaction (Voter Dynamics):** Every distinct pair of agents $(i, j)$ interacts at a constant rate $\\gamma$. During an interaction, one of the two agents is chosen with equal probability to adopt the opinion of the other.\n2.  **Mutation:** Independently of the interactions, each agent spontaneously flips its opinion (from A to B, or from B to A) at a constant rate $\\mu$.\n\nThese two processes can lead the system to a statistical steady state where the number of agents with a given opinion fluctuates around a mean value.\n\nLet $k$ be the number of agents with opinion A.

Our final practice delves into this concept with the Barabasi-Albert model, a foundational model for the emergence of scale-free networks [@problem_id:869960]. You will use a mean-field approach to demonstrate how the simple mechanism of 'preferential attachment'—where new nodes are more likely to connect to already popular nodes—causes the network to self-organize.

Consider a network that starts with a small number of nodes $m_0$ and grows by adding one new node at each discrete time step. Each new node connects to $m$ existing nodes. The defining characteristic of the model is preferential attachment: the probability that a new node will connect to an existing node $i$ is proportional to the degree $k_i$ of that node.\n\nWe can analyze the properties of this network using a continuous mean-field approximation. In this framework, we treat time $t$ and the degree of a node $k$ as continuous variables. For large times $t \\gg m_0$, the total number of nodes is $N(t) \\approx t$ and the sum of the degrees of all nodes in the network is $\\sum_j k_j \\approx 2mt$.\n\nThe probability for a new node to attach to a given node $i$ with degree $k_i$ is $\\Pi(k_i) = k_i / \\sum_j k_j \\approx k_i / (2mt)$.

The degree distribution $P(k)$ gives the probability that a randomly selected node has degree $k$. For large $k$, this distribution follows a power law of the form $P(k) \\sim k^{-\\gamma}$. To find $\\gamma$, follow these steps:\n1.  Solve the differential equation for $k_i(t)$ with the given initial condition to find the degree of a node $i$ at time $t>t_i$.\n2.  Assume that nodes are added at a constant rate, meaning the introduction times $t_i$ are uniformly distributed. Use this to find the cumulative probability distribution $P(K > k)$, which is the probability that a randomly chosen node has a degree greater than $k$.\n3.  From the cumulative distribution, derive the probability density function $P(k)$.\n4.  Determine the exponent $\\gamma$ from the asymptotic form of $P(k)$ for large $k$.", "solution": "1.
