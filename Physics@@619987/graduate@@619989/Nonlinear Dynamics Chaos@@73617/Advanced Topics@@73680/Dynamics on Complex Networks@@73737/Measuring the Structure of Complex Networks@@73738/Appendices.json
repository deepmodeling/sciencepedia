A **vertex cover** of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$ such that every edge in $E$ has at least one endpoint in $S$. The **minimum vertex cover** is a vertex cover with the smallest possible number of vertices. The size of the minimum vertex cover of a graph $G$ is denoted by $\\tau(G)$.\n\nConsider the **friendship graph** $F_n$, also known as the Dutch windmill graph. This graph is constructed by taking $n$ copies of the 3-cycle graph (a triangle) and joining them at a single, common vertex.

An example for $n=3$ is shown below.\n\n\n\nThis structure models certain social networks where an individual (the central vertex) belongs to multiple distinct groups of three (the triangles).
