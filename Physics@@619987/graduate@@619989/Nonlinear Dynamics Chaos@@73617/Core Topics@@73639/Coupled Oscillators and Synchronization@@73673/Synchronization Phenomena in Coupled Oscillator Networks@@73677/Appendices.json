It presents a standard problem in the study of synchronization phenomena, specifically the application of the Kuramoto model to a population of neuronal oscillators. It is free of contradictions or ambiguities and provides all necessary information for a rigorous solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe system consists of a large population of $N$ oscillators, where $N \\to \\infty$. The phase dynamics of the $i$-th oscillator is described by the Kuramoto model under a mean-field coupling approximation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_i}{dt} = \\omega_i + \\frac{K}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\sin(\\theta_j - \\theta_i)\n$$\nHere, $\\theta_i$ is the phase of oscillator $i$, $\\omega_i$ is its natural angular frequency, and $K$ is the uniform coupling strength.\n\nThe level of macroscopic synchrony is quantified by the complex order parameter $z$, defined as the centroid of the phases on the unit circle:\n$$\nz(t) = r(t) e^{i\\psi(t)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{i\\theta_j}\n$$\nwhere $r(t)$ is the magnitude of the order parameter, representing the phase coherence, and $\\psi(t)$ is the average phase.\nSubstituting this definition into the phase dynamics equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_i}{dt} = \\omega_i + K r \\sin(\\psi - \\theta_i)\n$$\nTo analyze the stationary state, we move to a frame rotating with the mean phase $\\psi$. Let $\\phi_i(t) = \\theta_i(t) - \\psi(t)$. In a stationary synchronized state, the order parameter magnitude $r$ is constant, and the mean phase rotates at a constant collective frequency, $\\dot{\\psi} = \\Omega$. The dynamics of the relative phases $\\phi_i$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi_i}{dt} = \\dot{\\theta}_i - \\dot{\\psi} = \\omega_i - \\Omega - K r \\sin(\\phi_i)\n$$\nIn the stationary state, a fraction of oscillators become phase-locked to the mean field, meaning their relative phases are constant, $\\dot{\\phi}_i = 0$. This implies:\n$$\n\\sin(\\phi_i) = \\frac{\\omega_i - \\Omega}{K r}\n$$\nThis condition can only be satisfied for oscillators whose natural frequencies are sufficiently close to the collective frequency $\\Omega$, specifically those for which $|\\omega_i - \\Omega| \\le Kr$. These are the \"locked\" oscillators. Oscillators for which $|\\omega_i - \\Omega| > Kr$ are \"drifting\" and their phases continuously change relative to the mean phase.\n\nIn the continuum limit ($N \\to \\infty$), we describe the population with a probability distribution of natural frequencies, $g(\\omega)$. The order parameter $r$ must satisfy the self-consistency condition:\n$$\nr = \\left| \\langle e^{i\\phi} \\rangle \\right| = \\left| \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\phi(\\omega)} g(\\omega) d\\omega \\right|\n$$\nBy an appropriate choice of the time origin, we can set $\\psi(0)=0$, which implies that the stationary order parameter is real, $z=r$. This leads to two conditions:\n$$\nr = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos(\\phi(\\omega)) g(\\omega) d\\omega\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\sin(\\phi(\\omega)) g(\\omega) d\\omega\n$$\nThe second equation implicitly defines the collective frequency $\\Omega$. The problem directs us to simplify this by setting the collective frequency to be the mean of the frequency distribution, $\\Omega = \\omega_0 = \\langle \\omega \\rangle$. This is a valid approximation for narrow, nearly symmetric distributions. We define a centered frequency variable $\\omega' = \\omega - \\omega_0$, and the centered distribution $g'(\\omega')=g(\\omega'+\\omega_0)$, which has a mean of zero. The locking condition becomes $\\sin(\\phi) = \\omega'/(Kr)$.\n\nThe locked oscillators have stable phases in $[-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$, for which $\\cos(\\phi) > 0$. For these oscillators, $\\cos(\\phi(\\omega')) = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(\\phi(\\omega'))} = \\sqrt{1 - (\\omega'/(Kr))^2}$. The contribution of drifting oscillators to the time-averaged order parameter is zero. Thus, the self-consistency equation for $r$ includes only the contribution from the locked population:\n$$\nr = \\int_{-Kr}^{Kr} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega'}{Kr}\\right)^2} g'(\\omega') d\\omega'\n$$\nThis is the stationary self-consistent equation for the order parameter magnitude $r$.\n\nThe distribution of periods $T$ is given as a normal distribution, $p(T)$, with mean $\\mu_T = 24$ hours and standard deviation $\\sigma_T = 0.5$ hours:\n$$\np(T) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_T} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(T-\\mu_T)^2}{2\\sigma_T^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe angular frequency distribution $g(\\omega)$ is derived via the change of variables formula using the relation $\\omega = 2\\pi/T$:\n$$\ng(\\omega) = p(T(\\omega)) \\left|\\frac{dT}{d\\omega}\\right| = p\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}\\right) \\left|-\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega^2}\\right| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_T} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(2\\pi/\\omega - \\mu_T)^2}{2\\sigma_T^2} \\right) \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega^2}\n$$\nThis distribution is defined for $\\omega > 0$. For our numerical implementation, we will normalize it over a finite but sufficiently wide support.\n\nThe onset of synchronization occurs at a critical coupling strength, $K_c$. For $K \\le K_c$, the only stable solution is the incoherent state, $r=0$. For $K > K_c$, a non-zero solution for $r$ appears. We find $K_c$ by analyzing the self-consistency equation for $r \\to 0^+$. In this limit, the integration range $[-Kr, Kr]$ is small, so we can approximate $g'(\\omega') \\approx g'(0)$.\n$$\nr \\approx g'(0) \\int_{-Kr}^{Kr} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{\\omega'}{Kr}\\right)^2} d\\omega'\n$$\nUsing the substitution $u = \\omega'/(Kr)$, $d\\omega'=Kr du$:\n$$\nr \\approx g'(0) (Kr) \\int_{-1}^{1} \\sqrt{1 - u^2} du = g'(0) Kr \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($r \\neq 0$), we divide by $r$ to find the bifurcation point: $1 = K_c g'(0) \\pi/2$. Thus, the critical coupling is:\n$$\nK_c = \\frac{2}{\\pi g'(0)} = \\frac{2}{\\pi g(\\omega_0)}\n$$\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\n1.  Define the unnormalized frequency distribution $g(\\omega)$ from the given $T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(24, 0.5^2)$.\n2.  Establish a numerical support for $\\omega$ corresponding to a wide range of periods, e.g., $\\mu_T \\pm 8\\sigma_T$, which is $[20, 28]$ hours. This translates to an interval $[\\omega_{min}, \\omega_{max}] = [2\\pi/28, 2\\pi/20]$.\n3.  Compute the normalization factor $C = \\int_{\\omega_{min}}^{\\omega_{max}} g(\\omega) d\\omega$ and define the normalized distribution $g_{norm}(\\omega) = g(\\omega)/C$.\n4.  Compute the mean frequency $\\omega_0 = \\int_{\\omega_{min}}^{\\omega_{max}} \\omega g_{norm}(\\omega) d\\omega$.\n5.  Calculate the critical coupling $K_c = 2/(\\pi g_{norm}(\\omega_0))$.\n6.  For each given coupling strength $K$:\n    a. If $K \\le K_c$, the result is $r=0$.\n    b. If $K > K_c$, solve the non-linear equation $f(r) = r - F(r) = 0$ for $r \\in (0,1]$, where $F(r) = \\int_{-Kr}^{Kr} \\sqrt{1 - (\\omega'/(Kr))^2} g_{norm}(\\omega'+\\omega_0) d\\omega'$. This is done using a numerical root-finding algorithm (Brent's method) on an interval such as $[10^{-9}, 1]$, as theory confirms that a root must exist in this range for $K > K_c$. The integral for $F(r)$ is computed using numerical quadrature.\n7.
