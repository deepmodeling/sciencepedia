This more advanced problem explores the subtle distinction between locally and globally riddled basins, a property governed by the stability of individual periodic orbits embedded within the chaotic attractor. This practice will challenge you to analyze both the average stability of the attractor and the stability of its constituent orbits to gain a deeper appreciation for the intricate structure of chaotic systems.", "problem": "A two-dimensional discrete-time dynamical system is described by the coupled maps:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{n+1} &= 4x_n(1-x_n) \\\\\ny_{n+1} &= b y_n (1-x_n)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $x_n \\in [0, 1]$, $y_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and $b$ is a positive control parameter.

The chaotic attractor on this manifold is the entire interval $A = [0,1]$.\n\nFor certain parameter values, the basin of attraction of the chaotic attractor $A$ can be \"riddled,\" meaning that any neighborhood of a point in its basin also contains points that are not in its basin (i.e., they are in the basin of another attractor, in this case the attractor at $y \\to \\pm\\infty$).\n\nA distinction is made between locally and globally riddled basins. A basin is locally but not globally riddled if some, but not all, regions of the basin are riddled. This occurs when the chaotic attractor $A$ is on average transversely unstable, but there exist periodic orbits embedded within $A$ that are still transversely stable. The existence of such stable periodic orbits creates non-riddled \"absorbing areas\" within the basin.\n\nThe onset of riddling occurs at the **blowout bifurcation** parameter, $b_c$, where the transverse Lyapunov exponent for the chaotic attractor becomes positive. The transition from a locally riddled basin to a globally riddled basin occurs at the **riddling bifurcation** parameter, $b_r$, where the last transversely stable periodic orbit becomes unstable.

This property leads to a fundamental uncertainty in predicting the final state of the system when the initial state is known with only finite precision.\n\nA key characteristic of such basins in a two-dimensional phase space ($d=2$) is the probability, $P_{diff}(r)$, that two points separated by a small distance $r$ belong to different basins of attraction.
