The dynamics on this interval are chaotic, and a typical trajectory starting in $I$ will explore the entire interval according to a specific probability density function $\\rho(x)$, known as the invariant density. For $\\mu=4$, this density is given by:\n$$\\rho(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}$$\n\nNow, consider the case where the parameter is slightly above this chaotic threshold, $\\mu = 4 + \\epsilon$, with $\\epsilon > 0$ being a small constant. In this \"supercritical\" regime, the maximum value of the map is $f_\\mu(1/2) = \\mu/4 = 1 + \\epsilon/4$, which is greater than 1. Consequently, there is an interval of points $J \\subset I$ that are mapped outside of $I$ in a single iteration.\n\nInitial conditions $x_0 \\in I$ can now generate trajectories that eventually leave the interval $I$. This phenomenon is known as transient chaos. The set of points that remain in $I$ for all iterations, $\\mathcal{R} = \\{x_0 \\in I | f_\\mu^n(x_0) \\in I \\text{ for all } n \\ge 0\\}$, is a fractal repeller. If we consider a large ensemble of initial conditions distributed in $I$ according to the density $\\rho(x)$, the fraction of trajectories $S(n)$ that remain in $I$ after $n$ iterations is observed to decay exponentially for large $n$: $S(n) \\sim e^{-\\kappa n}$. The constant $\\kappa$ is called the escape rate.\n\nAssuming that for small $\\epsilon$, the probability of escape per iteration can be calculated by integrating the invariant density $\\rho(x)$ of the $\\mu=4$ map over the escape interval $J$, determine the escape rate $\\kappa$ to the leading order in $\\epsilon$.", "solution": "We seek the escape rate $\\kappa$ to leading order in $\\epsilon>0$ by computing the probability per iterate that $x_n$ is mapped outside $I=[0,1]$.
