This first exercise focuses on the aftermath of a boundary crisis, one of the most common types of chaotic transitions.

The goal is to calculate the escape rate from the resulting non-attracting chaotic set, providing a concrete measure of the system's instability and revealing a characteristic scaling law that governs the transition.", "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional logistic map, a classic example of a system exhibiting a transition to chaos. The map is defined by the iterative equation:\n$$x_{n+1} = f_r(x_n) = r x_n (1 - x_n)$$\nwhere $x_n \\in [0, 1]$ represents the state of the system at time $n$, and $r$ is a control parameter. For $r \\in [0, 4]$, any initial condition $x_0 \\in (0,1)$ generates a trajectory that remains bounded within the interval $[0,1]$. At the parameter value $r_c = 4$, the system has a chaotic attractor that spans the entire interval $[0,1]$. The invariant probability density for the state $x$ on this attractor is given by:\n$$\\rho(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}$$\n\nWhen the parameter $r$ is increased just beyond $r_c=4$, a \"boundary crisis\" occurs. The maximum of the map, $f_r(1/2) = r/4$, becomes greater than 1. This creates an \"escape region\" or a \"hole\" in the interval $[0,1]$, through which trajectories can leave the interval and subsequently diverge to $-\\infty$. The set of points that remain within $[0,1]$ for all future iterations forms a non-attracting chaotic set, also known as a chaotic saddle.\n\nFor $r>4$, the number of initial conditions $N(n)$ that remain in $[0,1]$ after $n$ iterations is observed to decay exponentially for large $n$:\n$$N(n) \\sim e^{-\\kappa n}$$\nHere, $\\kappa$ is the escape rate from the chaotic saddle. A good approximation for the escape rate, for $r$ slightly greater than $r_c=4$, is obtained by calculating the total probability of an orbit landing in the escape region in a single iteration. This probability is computed by integrating the invariant density of the system at the crisis point, $\\rho(x)$, over the escape region.\n\nLet $r = 4 + \\delta$, where $\\delta > 0$ is a small parameter. The escape rate is found to scale with $\\delta$ according to the power law $\\kappa \\approx A \\sqrt{\\delta}$ for $\\delta \\to 0^+$.

For $r > r_c = 4$, trajectories initiated in the interval $[0, 1]$ will, after a potentially chaotic transient, escape to $-\\infty$. This occurs because the map's maximum value, $r/4$, exceeds 1, mapping a point inside $[0,1]$ to a point outside of it.

This final problem introduces a more subtle and complex phenomenon known as a riddling bifurcation, which occurs in systems with an invariant subspace, such as coupled oscillators. Here, the crisis does not destroy the synchronized chaotic state but rather riddles its basin of attraction, making the system's long-term behavior unpredictably sensitive to initial conditions near the synchronization manifold [@problem_id:859849].

For a range of parameters, the system can exhibit synchronized chaos, where the dynamics are confined to the invariant manifold $x_n = y_n$. On this manifold, the evolution is described by the single logistic map $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$.\n\nA _riddling bifurcation_ is a type of crisis that can occur in such a system. It happens when an unstable periodic orbit (UPO) embedded within the synchronized chaotic attractor loses its stability in the direction transverse to the synchronization manifold. This destabilization causes the basin of attraction for the synchronized state to become \"riddled\" with points that diverge, leading to intermittent bursting behavior away from the $x_n = y_n$ manifold.\n\nThe transverse stability of a period-$k$ orbit $\\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_k\\}$ on the synchronized manifold is determined by the magnitude of its transverse stability multiplier, $\\Lambda_T$.

The system possesses an unstable period-2 orbit on the synchronization manifold. For this value of $r$, as the coupling $\\epsilon$ is increased from zero, this period-2 orbit is initially transversely unstable, becomes stable at a critical value $\\epsilon_{c1}$, and then loses stability again at a second critical value $\\epsilon_{c2} > \\epsilon_{c1}$.
