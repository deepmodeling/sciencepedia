The buckets are equally spaced at $2\\pi/3$ radian intervals. The wheel rotates about a fixed horizontal axis, and its motion is subject to a viscous damping torque $-\\nu\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the angular velocity. The total moment of inertia of the water-filled buckets is approximated as a constant, $I$.\n\nWater is continuously supplied from a source positioned above the wheel. The rate at which bucket $i$ collects water, $q_i$, depends on its angular position $\\phi_i$:\n$$q_i(\\phi_i) = q_0 \\max(0, \\cos\\phi_i)$$\nwhere $\\phi_i$ is the angle of the $i$-th bucket measured from the upward vertical axis, and $q_0$ is a positive constant representing the maximum inflow rate.
