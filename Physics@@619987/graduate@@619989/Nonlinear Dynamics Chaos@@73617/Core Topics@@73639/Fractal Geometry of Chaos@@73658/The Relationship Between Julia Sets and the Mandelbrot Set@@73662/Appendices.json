This means that the orbit of the critical point, defined by the sequence $z_{n+1} = f_c(z_n)$ with $z_0=0$, eventually lands on a periodic cycle but is not periodic itself. Formally, there exist integers $k>0$ (the pre-period length) and $p \\ge 1$ (the period) such that $z_{k+p} = z_k$, and the points $z_0, z_1, \\dots, z_{k-1}$ are distinct from the points of the cycle $\\{z_k, z_{k+1}, \\dots, z_{k+p-1}\\}$.

For a given complex parameter $c$, the plane is divided into the Fatou set (where the dynamics is stable) and the Julia set $J_c$ (where the dynamics is chaotic).\n\nWhen the Julia set $J_c$ is connected, there exists a conformal isomorphism $\\Phi_c: \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\overline{\\mathbb{D}} \\to \\mathbb{C} \\setminus K_c$, where $\\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disk and $K_c$ is the filled Julia set (the union of $J_c$ and the bounded components of its complement).
