It states that for a system $\\dot{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{x})$, if the divergence of the vector field $\\mathbf{F}$, denoted $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}$, does not change sign (i.e., is either always positive or always negative) within a simply connected region $D$ of the phase space, then there are no periodic orbits lying entirely in $D$.
