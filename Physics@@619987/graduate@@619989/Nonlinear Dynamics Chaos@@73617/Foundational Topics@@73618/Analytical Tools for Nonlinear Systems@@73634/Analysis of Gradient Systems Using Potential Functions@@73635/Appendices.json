A local minimum of $V$ corresponds to a stable fixed point (attractor), while a saddle point of $V$ corresponds to a saddle point of the flow.\n\nThe Hessian matrix is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y \\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nCalculating the second derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = 12x^2 - 4\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y^2} = 2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial y \\partial x} = 0\n$$\nSo the Hessian matrix is:\n$$\nH(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12x^2 - 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we evaluate the Hessian at each fixed point:\n\n*   At $P_1 = (0, 0)$:\n    $$\n    H(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -4$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since one eigenvalue is positive and one is negative, the point $(0,0)$ is a saddle point of the potential function.\n\n*   At $P_2 = (1, 0)$:\n    $$\n    H(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12(1)^2 - 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 8$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$.

Calculate the potential energy at the saddle point.**\nThe problem asks for the potential energy value at the saddle point. We have identified the saddle point to be located at $(x,y) = (0,0)$. We now evaluate the potential function $V(x,y)$ at this point.\n$$\nV(0,0) = (0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + (0)^2 = 0\n$$\nThis value represents the energy of the potential barrier between the two wells. For comparison, the potential at the bottom of the wells (the stable points) is:\n$$\nV(\\pm 1, 0) = (\\pm 1)^4 - 2(\\pm 1)^2 + (0)^2 = 1 - 2 = -1\n$$\nThe energy barrier height is the difference $V_{saddle} - V_{minima} = 0 - (-1) = 1$.
