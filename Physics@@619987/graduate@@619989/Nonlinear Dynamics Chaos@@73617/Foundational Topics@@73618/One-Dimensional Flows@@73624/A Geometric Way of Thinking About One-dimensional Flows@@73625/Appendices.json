One of the most fundamental bifurcations is the saddle-node (or tangent) bifurcation. It corresponds to the creation or annihilation of a pair of fixed points. Geometrically, this occurs at a parameter value where the graph of $f(x)$ becomes tangent to the $x$-axis. This tangency condition implies that at the bifurcation point, not only is the function zero, but its derivative with respect to $x$ is also zero.

If $r$ is changed very slowly (adiabatically), the system's state $x$ is assumed to remain at a stable fixed point. When $r$ is slowly cycled from a sufficiently negative value to a sufficiently positive value and then back, the system can exhibit hysteresis. This means the path traced by the state variable $x(r)$ in the $(r,x)$ plane forms a closed loop as the system jumps between different stable branches at bifurcation points.\n\nFor the system described, a hysteresis loop is formed in the upper half-plane ($x > 0$) of the $(r,x)$ state-parameter space.

We can rewrite this as $r = x^4 - x^2$. The curve of non-zero fixed points in the $(r,x)$ plane is given by this equation.\n\nTo determine stability, we analyze the sign of the derivative $f'(x) = \\frac{d\\dot{x}}{dx}$ at the fixed points:\n$$\nf'(x) = r + 3x^2 - 5x^4\n$$\nFor the non-zero fixed points, we can substitute $r = x^4 - x^2$:\n$$\nf'(x^*) = ( (x^*)^4 - (x^*)^2 ) + 3(x^*)^2 - 5(x^*)^4 = 2(x^*)^2 - 4(x^*)^4 = 2(x^*)^2 (1 - 2(x^*)^2)\n$$\nSince $(x^*)^2 > 0$ for non-zero fixed points, stability ($f'(x^*)  0$) requires $1 - 2(x^*)^2  0$, which means $(x^*)^2 > 1/2$. The fixed points are unstable for $0  (x^*)^2  1/2$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the bifurcation points**\nThe hysteresis loop is bounded by bifurcation points where the system jumps between stable states. These jumps occur at saddle-node bifurcations, where stable and unstable branches of fixed points merge. On the curve $r(x) = x^4 - x^2$, these \"turning points\" occur where $dr/dx = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{dx} = 4x^3 - 2x = 2x(2x^2 - 1)\n$$\nSetting $dr/dx = 0$ gives $x=0$ and $x = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nAt $x=0$, we have $r=0$. This corresponds to a pitchfork bifurcation where the $x^*=0$ fixed point changes stability. For $r0$, $f'(0)=r0$, so $x^*=0$ is stable. For $r>0$, $f'(0)=r>0$, so $x^*=0$ is unstable.\n\nAt $x = \\pm 1/\\sqrt{2}$, we have $r = (1/\\sqrt{2})^4 - (1/\\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/4 - 1/2 = -1/4$. These are the coordinates of the saddle-node bifurcations.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the hysteresis loop**\nWe trace the system's state $x$ as the parameter $r$ is cycled from a large negative value to a large positive value and back again.\n1.  **Increasing $r$**: Start with $r  -1/4$. The only stable fixed point is $x^*=0$. The system remains at $x=0$. As $r$ increases past $-1/4$, $x=0$ is still stable. This continues until $r=0$. At $r=0$, the fixed point at the origin undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation and becomes unstable. The system must jump to one of the newly available outer stable branches. For the loop in the upper half-plane, it jumps from $x=0$ to $x=1$ (since at $r=0$, the stable FPs are at $x=\\pm 1$).\n2.  **Decreasing $r$**: Now, as we decrease $r$ from a positive value, the system's state tracks the upper stable branch, given by $r = x^4 - x^2$ for $x^2 > 1/2$. The state moves from $(r,x)=(0,1)$ downwards along this curve.\n3.  **The second jump**: The system continues along this upper branch until it reaches the \"knee\" of the curve at the saddle-node bifurcation point, which we found to be at $(r,x) = (-1/4, 1/\\sqrt{2})$. At this point, the stable branch merges with an unstable branch and disappears. The system must jump to the only remaining stable fixed point, which is $x=0$.\n4.  **Completing the loop**: As $r$ is decreased further below $-1/4$, the system remains at $x=0$.\n\nThe hysteresis loop is traversed clockwise in the $(r,x)$-plane and is defined by:\n-   An upper curve (part of decreasing $r$) from $(0,1)$ to $(-1/4, 1/\\sqrt{2})$.\n-   A lower line (part of increasing $r$) along $x=0$ from $r=-1/4$ to $r=0$.\n-   Two vertical jumps connecting the paths.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area integral**\nThe area of a closed loop in the $(r,x)$ plane is given by the line integral $A = \\oint x \\, dr$. The area is the integral over the upper path minus the integral over the lower path:\n$$ A = \\int_{-1/4}^{0} x_{\\text{upper}}(r) \\, dr - \\int_{-1/4}^{0} x_{\\text{lower}}(r) \\, dr $$\nThe upper path is the curve $r = x^4 - x^2$, and the lower path is the line $x=0$. The integral along the lower path is zero.\n$$ A = \\int_{-1/4}^{0} x_{\\text{upper}}(r) \\, dr $$\nIt is much easier to change the integration variable from $r$ to $x$. Along the upper path, we have the parameterization $r = x^4 - x^2$, so $dr = (4x^3 - 2x) dx$. As $r$ goes from $-1/4$ to $0$, $x$ goes from $1/\\sqrt{2}$ to $1$.
