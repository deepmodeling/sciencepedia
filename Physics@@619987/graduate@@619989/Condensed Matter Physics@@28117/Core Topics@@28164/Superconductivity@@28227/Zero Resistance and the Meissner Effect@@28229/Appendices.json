I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we derive the constitutive relation for the bulk of the superconductor. Second, we apply this to the specific geometry of an ellipsoid to find the measured magnetization.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Constitutive Relation**\n\nWe start from the London equations for a superconductor in a static magnetic field. The second London equation relates the supercurrent density $\\mathbf{J}_s$ to the magnetic vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$ in the London gauge ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = 0$):\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\lambda^2} \\mathbf{A}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the London penetration depth and $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability.\n\nTaking the curl of this equation gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\lambda^2} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A})\n$$\nSince the magnetic induction $\\mathbf{B}$ is defined as $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$, we have:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\lambda^2} \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nNow, we use the magnetostatic Ampere's law, where the free current is the supercurrent:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J}_s\n$$\nThe fields inside the material are the internal fields $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}}$. So, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\mathbf{J}_s$. Substituting this into the previous equation, we obtain a relation between $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}}) = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\lambda^2} \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}}\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{V}$ and the magnetostatic relation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0$, which implies $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mu_0(\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\mathbf{M})) = 0$, and assuming a homogeneous response where $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is related to magnetic charge density (which is zero away from surfaces), we eventually arrive at the screening equation. A more direct path is to combine $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}_s$ with the curled London equation. This leads to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}}\n$$\nTaking the curl again and using $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}}\n$$\nThis is a differential equation whose solutions describe the exponential decay of the magnetic field from the surface into the superconductor's interior over a characteristic length $\\lambda$.\n\nThe problem states that the sample is \"macroscopically large,\" meaning its dimensions are much greater than $\\lambda$. Consequently, deep inside the bulk of the material, the magnetic induction must decay to zero. This is the essence of the Meissner effect. Therefore, in the bulk interior of the superconductor:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0\n$$\nThe fundamental relation in magnetostatics connecting the magnetic induction $\\mathbf{B}$, the magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$, and the magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 (\\mathbf{H} + \\mathbf{M})\n$$\nApplying this to the interior of the superconductor:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\mu_0 (\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\mathbf{M})\n$$\nSubstituting the result of the Meissner effect, $\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0$:\n$$\n0 = \\mu_0 (\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\mathbf{M})\n$$\nSince $\\mu_0$ is a non-zero constant, we obtain the required linear constitutive relation between the bulk magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$ and the internal magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = -\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}}\n$$\nThis relationship shows that a bulk superconductor in the Meissner state behaves as a perfect diamagnet, with a magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_m = -1$.\n\n**Part 2: Magnetization of the Ellipsoid**\n\nNow we consider the specific geometry of a homogeneous ellipsoid placed in a uniform external field $\\mathbf{H}_a$. A key result from magnetostatics is that for such a configuration, the internal field $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and the magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$ are also uniform throughout the ellipsoid.\n\nThe internal field $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is the superposition of the applied field $\\mathbf{H}_a$ and the demagnetizing field $\\mathbf{H}_d$, which is generated by the magnetization itself:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\mathbf{H}_a + \\mathbf{H}_d\n$$\nThe demagnetizing field is linearly related to the magnetization by the demagnetizing tensor $\\hat{N}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_d = -\\hat{N} \\mathbf{M}\n$$\nCombining these two equations gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\mathbf{H}_a - \\hat{N} \\mathbf{M}\n$$\nThe problem states that the applied field $\\mathbf{H}_a$ is aligned with one of the principal axes of the ellipsoid. Due to the symmetry of the ellipsoid, the tensor $\\hat{N}$ is diagonal in the coordinate system of its principal axes. Therefore, if $\\mathbf{H}_a$ is along a principal axis, the vectors $\\mathbf{H}_a$, $\\mathbf{H}_{\\mathrm{int}}$, and $\\mathbf{M}$ are all collinear. This allows us to simplify the vector equations to scalar equations along the direction of the applied field. Let $H_a$, $H_{\\mathrm{int}}$, and $M$ be the components of these vectors along the field direction, and let $N$ be the corresponding scalar demagnetizing factor (the diagonal component of $\\hat{N}$ for that axis).\n\nThe system of equations becomes:\n1.  $M = -H_{\\mathrm{int}}$ (the constitutive relation for the superconductor)\n2.  $H_{\\mathrm{int}} = H_a - N M$ (the relation for the internal field in an ellipsoid)\n\nOur goal is to find the measured magnetization $M$ as a function of the applied field $H_a$ and the demagnetizing factor $N$. We can solve this system of two linear equations. Substitute the first equation into the second:\n$$\n-M = H_a - N M\n$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $M$:\n$$\nN M - M = H_a\n$$\nFactor out $M$:\n$$\nM(N - 1) = H_a\n$$\nFinally, we obtain the expression for the magnetization:\n$$\nM = \\frac{H_a}{N - 1}\n$$\nIt is conventional to write the denominator as a positive quantity for $0 \\le N < 1$, which is always the case for an ellipsoid:\n$$\nM(H_a) = -\\frac{H_a}{1 - N}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the magnetization of the superconducting ellipsoid along the direction of the applied field, given in the required SI units of A/m. This quantity represents the apparent response of the sample, which is modified from the intrinsic perfect diamagnetism by the geometric demagnetizing effect.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{H_a}{1 - N}}\n$$", "id": "3024756"}, {"introduction": "Beyond zero resistance and flux expulsion, superconductivity is fundamentally a macroscopic quantum phenomenon, described by a single, coherent wavefunction.

The current density is given by $j_s = n_s e^{*} v_s$, where $e^* = 2e$ is the charge of a Cooper pair. Since the superflow is assumed to be uniform, the magnitude of the velocity $v_s$ is constant along the ring.\n$$I = n_s e^{*} A v_s$$\nWe can express the velocity in terms of the current:\n$$v_s = \\frac{I}{n_s e^{*} A}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $v_s$ into the equation for $E_{\\mathrm{kin}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{kin}} = \\frac{1}{2} n_s l A m^{*} \\left(\\frac{I}{n_s e^{*} A}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{m^{*} l}{n_s e^{*2} A}\\right) I^2$$\nThe kinetic energy has the form of the energy stored in an inductor, $E = \\frac{1}{2} L I^2$. By comparing the two expressions, we can identify the kinetic inductance $L_k$:\n$$L_k = \\frac{m^{*} l}{n_s e^{*2} A}$$\nThe problem defines the London penetration depth $\\lambda$ by the relation $\\lambda^2 = m^{*}/(\\mu_{0}n_{s}e^{*2})$.

Thus, $\\oint_C \\nabla\\theta \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = 2\\pi n$, where $n$ is an integer (the winding number). The left side becomes $\\hbar(2\\pi n) = hn$.\n2.  The magnetic flux through the hole of the ring is defined as $\\Phi = \\oint_C \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$.\n3.

The solution for the magnetic field is:\n$$\nB_z(x) = B_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda_L)\n$$\nThis confirms that $\\lambda_L$ is the exponential decay length for the magnetic field.\n\nNext, we incorporate the temperature dependence using the two-fluid model. The superfluid number density $n_s$ is given as a function of temperature $T$:\n$$\nn_s(T) = n \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4\\right]\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the total electron number density and $T_c$ is the critical temperature. Substituting this into the definition of $\\lambda_L$:\n$$\n\\lambda_L(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\mu_0 e^2 n_s(T)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\mu_0 e^2 n \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4\\right]}}\n$$\nThe penetration depth at absolute zero, $\\lambda_L(0)$, is found by taking the limit $T \\to 0$, where $n_s(T) \\to n$.\n$$\n\\lambda_L(0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\mu_0 n e^2}}\n$$\nWe can now express $\\lambda_L(T)$ in terms of $\\lambda_L(0)$:\n$$\n\\lambda_L(T) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\mu_0 n e^2}}}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4}} = \\lambda_L(0) \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nThis is the explicit temperature dependence of the London penetration depth within the two-fluid model.\n\nTo find the leading low-temperature asymptotic expansion for $T \\ll T_c$, we perform a binomial expansion of the expression for $\\lambda_L(T)$. Let $y = (T/T_c)^4$. Since $T \\ll T_c$, we have $y \\ll 1$. The expansion of $(1-y)^p$ for small $y$ is $1 - py + O(y^2)$. With $p = -1/2$:\n$$\n(1-y)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\approx 1 - (-\\frac{1}{2})y = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}y\n$$\nSubstituting back $y = (T/T_c)^4$, we get the low-temperature approximation:\n$$\n\\lambda_L(T) \\approx \\lambda_L(0) \\left[1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4\\right]\n$$\n\nFinally, we compare this low-temperature behavior with the prediction from the microscopic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory. The two-fluid model predicts that the fractional change in the penetration depth, $\\frac{\\lambda_L(T) - \\lambda_L(0)}{\\lambda_L(0)}$, varies as a power law, specifically $\\propto T^4$.\nIn contrast, BCS theory for a clean, isotropic, fully gapped superconductor predicts that low-temperature properties are governed by the thermal excitation of quasiparticles across a finite energy gap $\\Delta$. At temperatures much lower than the gap energy ($k_B T \\ll \\Delta_0$, where $\\Delta_0$ is the gap at $T=0$), the number of such excitations is exponentially suppressed. This leads to a correction to the penetration depth that is also exponentially small. The precise asymptotic form derived from BCS theory is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_L(T)}{\\lambda_L(0)} \\approx 1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta_0}{2 k_B T}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_0}{k_B T}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } T \\ll T_c\n$$\nThe crucial difference lies in the functional form of the temperature dependence. The two-fluid model's prediction of a $T^4$ power-law dependence is qualitatively incorrect at very low temperatures. The BCS theory's prediction of an exponential dependence, stemming directly from the existence of a superconducting energy gap, is the physically correct description and is overwhelmingly supported by experimental measurements. Therefore, the phenomenological two-fluid model, while a useful approximation over a wider temperature range, fails to capture the essential physics of a gapped system in the low-temperature limit. The quantity $\\lambda_L(T)$ has units of length, and so its expression is given in meters if all constituent quantities are in SI units.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\lambda_L(0) \\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2}}}\n$$", "id": "3024734"}]}
