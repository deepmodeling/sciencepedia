It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Equilibrium Free Energy Density**\n\nThe Ginzburg-Landau free energy density difference between the superconducting ($s$) and normal ($n$) states is given by\n$$\n\\Delta f = f_{s} - f_{n} = a(T)\\,|\\psi|^{2} + \\frac{b}{2}\\,|\\psi|^{4} + \\kappa\\,|\\nabla \\psi|^{2}\n$$\nThe problem states that we assume spatial uniformity, which implies the gradient of the order parameter is zero, $\\nabla \\psi = 0$. The expression for the free energy density difference simplifies to\n$$\n\\Delta f = a(T)\\,|\\psi|^{2} + \\frac{b}{2}\\,|\\psi|^{4}\n$$\nThe equilibrium state corresponds to the value of the order parameter $\\psi$ that minimizes this free energy density. To find this minimum, we differentiate $\\Delta f$ with respect to $|\\psi|$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta f)}{\\partial |\\psi|} = 2a(T)\\,|\\psi| + 2b\\,|\\psi|^{3} = 2|\\psi|\\,(a(T) + b\\,|\\psi|^{2}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields two possible solutions for the equilibrium value of $|\\psi|$, denoted as $|\\psi|_{0}$:\n1.  $|\\psi|_{0} = 0$. This is the trivial solution, corresponding to the normal state.\n2.  $|\\psi|_{0}^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)}{b}$. This is the non-trivial solution.\n\nTo determine which solution corresponds to a stable minimum, we examine the second derivative of $\\Delta f$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}(\\Delta f)}{(\\partial |\\psi|)^{2}} = 2a(T) + 6b\\,|\\psi|^{2}\n$$\nThe problem is concerned with the superconducting phase, which exists for temperatures $T < T_{c}$. In this regime, $a(T) = a_{0}(T - T_{c}) < 0$.\n\n-   For the trivial solution, $|\\psi|_{0} = 0$, the second derivative is $2a(T)$. Since $a(T) < 0$ for $T < T_{c}$, the second derivative is negative. This indicates a local maximum, so the normal state is unstable below $T_{c}$.\n-   For the non-trivial solution, $|\\psi|_{0}^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)}{b}$, this value is positive since $a(T) < 0$ and $b > 0$. The second derivative at this point is\n    $$\n    \\left.\\frac{\\partial^{2}(\\Delta f)}{(\\partial |\\psi|)^{2}}\\right|_{|\\psi|^{2}=-a/b} = 2a(T) + 6b\\left(-\\frac{a(T)}{b}\\right) = 2a(T) - 6a(T) = -4a(T)\n    $$\n    Since $a(T) < 0$ for $T < T_{c}$, the second derivative $-4a(T)$ is positive. This indicates a stable minimum.\n\nTherefore, for $T < T_{c}$, the equilibrium value of the order parameter is given by $|\\psi|_{0}^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)}{b}$. We substitute this value back into the expression for $\\Delta f$ to find the equilibrium free energy density difference:\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\text{eq}} = a(T)\\left(-\\frac{a(T)}{b}\\right) + \\frac{b}{2}\\left(-\\frac{a(T)}{b}\\right)^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{b} + \\frac{b}{2}\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{b^{2}} = -\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{b} + \\frac{a(T)^{2}}{2b}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the equilibrium free energy density difference for $T < T_{c}$:\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\text{eq}} = -\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{2b}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Specific Heat Jump**\n\nThe specific heat per unit volume is defined as $C = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial T^{2}}$. We need to compute the specific heats for the superconducting ($C_{s}$) and normal ($C_{n}$) states.\n\nThe free energy of the normal state is $f_{n}$. Its specific heat is $C_{n} = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}}$. This serves as our baseline.\n\nFor $T < T_{c}$, the system is in the superconducting state, and its equilibrium free energy density is $f_{s}(T) = f_{n}(T) + \\Delta f_{\\text{eq}}(T)$. Using the result from Part 1 and the given form of $a(T) = a_{0}(T-T_{c})$:\n$$\nf_{s}(T) = f_{n}(T) - \\frac{\\left[a_{0}(T-T_{c})\\right]^{2}}{2b} = f_{n}(T) - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{2b}(T-T_{c})^{2}\n$$\nTo find $C_{s}$, we compute the second derivative of $f_{s}$ with respect to temperature $T$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_{s}}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial f_{n}}{\\partial T} - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{2b} \\cdot 2(T-T_{c}) = \\frac{\\partial f_{n}}{\\partial T} - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{b}(T-T_{c})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{s}}{\\partial T^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}} - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{b}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the specific heat of the superconducting state, $C_{s}$:\n$$\nC_{s} = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{s}}{\\partial T^{2}} = -T\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}} - \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{b}\\right) = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}} + \\frac{T a_{0}^{2}}{b}\n$$\nRecognizing that $C_{n} = -T\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{n}}{\\partial T^{2}}$, we have:\n$$\nC_{s}(T) = C_{n}(T) + \\frac{T a_{0}^{2}}{b} \\quad (\\text{for } T < T_{c})\n$$\nThe difference in specific heats for $T < T_{c}$ is therefore:\n$$\nC_{s}(T) - C_{n}(T) = \\frac{T a_{0}^{2}}{b}\n$$\nThe problem defines the specific heat jump as the limit as temperature approaches $T_{c}$ from below:\n$$\n\\Delta C \\equiv \\lim_{T \\to T_{c}^{-}} \\left(C_{s} - C_{n}\\right)\n$$\nEvaluating this limit:\n$$\n\\Delta C = \\lim_{T \\to T_{c}^{-}} \\left(\\frac{T a_{0}^{2}}{b}\\right) = \\frac{T_{c} a_{0}^{2}}{b}\n$$\nFor $T > T_{c}$, the system is in the normal state ($|\\psi|_{0}=0$), so $\\Delta f = 0$, which means $f_{s}=f_{n}$ and $C_{s}=C_{n}$. Thus, $C_{s}-C_{n}=0$ for $T>T_{c}$. The result for $\\Delta C$ represents the finite discontinuity in the specific heat at the second-order phase transition temperature $T_{c}$.\n\nThe two results requested are the equilibrium free energy density difference for $T < T_{c}$ and the specific heat jump at $T_{c}$.\n1.  $\\Delta f_{\\text{eq}} = -\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{2b}$\n2.  $\\Delta C = \\frac{a_{0}^{2} T_{c}}{b}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\frac{a(T)^{2}}{2b} & \\frac{a_{0}^{2} T_{c}}{b}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3009560"}, {"introduction": "A defining characteristic of a superconductor is its ability to expel magnetic fields, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Magnetic Penetration Depth\n\nWe begin with the relevant Maxwell's equation for magnetostatics, Ampere's Law, which relates the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ to the current density $\\mathbf{J}$. Inside the superconductor, the current is carried by the superfluid, so $\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{J}_s$.\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}_s\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability.\n\nNext, we employ the second London equation, which provides a constitutive relation between the supercurrent density $\\mathbf{J}_s$ and the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ inside a superconductor:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}_s = -\\frac{n_s e^2}{m} \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nHere, $n_s$ is the number density of superconducting charge carriers (the superfluid density), $e$ is the elementary charge, and $m$ is the electron mass. Note that $n_s$ is a function of temperature, $n_s(T)$.\n\nTo derive an equation for $\\mathbf{B}$ alone, we take the curl of Ampere's Law:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\mu_0 (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}_s)\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{V}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{V}$ and the Maxwell equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, the left side becomes $-\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$. Substituting this and the second London equation into the expression, we get:\n$$\n-\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\left( -\\frac{n_s(T) e^2}{m} \\mathbf{B} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the London equation for the magnetic field:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{\\mu_0 n_s(T) e^2}{m} \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is a characteristic equation describing the spatial variation of the magnetic field. It can be written in the form $\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda(T)^2} \\mathbf{B}$, which identifies the magnetic penetration depth $\\lambda(T)$ as:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\mu_0 n_s(T) e^2}}\n$$\nThis expression fulfills the first objective of the problem.\n\n### Temperature Dependence from the Two-Fluid Model\n\nThe problem provides the two-fluid model for the temperature dependence of the superfluid density:\n$$\nn_s(T) = n \\left[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4 \\right]\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the total density of charge carriers and $T_c$ is the superconducting critical temperature.\n\nWe first determine the zero-temperature penetration depth, $\\lambda(0)$. As $T \\to 0$, $n_s(T) \\to n_s(0) = n[1-0] = n$. Thus, all carriers are in the superfluid state. The penetration depth at zero temperature is:\n$$\n\\lambda(0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\mu_0 n e^2}}\n$$\nNow, we can express $\\lambda(T)$ in terms of $\\lambda(0)$. We substitute the expression for $n_s(T)$ into the formula for $\\lambda(T)$:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\mu_0 e^2 n \\left[1 - (T/T_c)^4\\right]}}\n$$\nBy separating the temperature-independent part, we can identify $\\lambda(0)$:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\mu_0 n e^2}}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - (T/T_c)^4}}\n$$\nRecognizing the first term as $\\lambda(0)$, we arrive at the closed-form expression for $\\lambda(T)$:\n$$\n\\lambda(T) = \\frac{\\lambda(0)}{\\sqrt{1 - (T/T_c)^4}}\n$$\nThis fulfills the second objective and is the expression required for the final answer.\n\n### Low-Temperature Behavior and Comparison with BCS Theory\n\nTo analyze the behavior at low temperatures ($T \\ll T_c$), we examine the change in penetration depth, $\\Delta\\lambda(T) = \\lambda(T) - \\lambda(0)$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda(T) = \\frac{\\lambda(0)}{\\sqrt{1 - (T/T_c)^4}} - \\lambda(0) = \\lambda(0) \\left[ \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4\\right)^{-1/2} - 1 \\right]\n$$\nFor $T \\ll T_c$, the term $x = (T/T_c)^4$ is very small. We can use the binomial expansion $(1-x)^{-1/2} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x$ for small $x$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda(T) \\approx \\lambda(0) \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4\\right) - 1 \\right] = \\frac{\\lambda(0)}{2} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4\n$$\nThus, within the two-fluid model, the leading low-temperature behavior of the change in penetration depth is a power law: $\\Delta\\lambda(T) \\propto T^4$.\n\nThis result can be compared with the prediction from the microscopic BCS theory for a conventional, isotropic $s$-wave superconductor. In BCS theory, single-particle excitations (quasiparticles) are separated from the ground state of Cooper pairs by an energy gap $\\Delta_{BCS}$. At low temperatures ($k_B T \\ll \\Delta_{BCS}(0)$), the density of thermally excited quasiparticles, which constitute the \"normal fluid\" $n_n(T)$, is exponentially suppressed:\n$$\nn_n(T) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_{BCS}(0)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe superfluid density is $n_s(T) = n - n_n(T)$. The change in penetration depth is approximately proportional to the normal fluid density:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda(T) = \\lambda(T) - \\lambda(0) = \\lambda(0)\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{n_s(T)}} - 1\\right) = \\lambda(0)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - n_n(T)/n}} - 1\\right) \\approx \\frac{\\lambda(0)}{2n} n_n(T)\n$$\nTherefore, the BCS prediction for the low-temperature behavior is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\lambda_{BCS}(T) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_{BCS}(0)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n**Qualitative Comparison**:\nThe two-fluid model predicts a power-law dependence ($\\Delta\\lambda \\propto T^4$), meaning that the penetration depth approaches its zero-temperature value relatively slowly as $T \\to 0$. In contrast, BCS theory for a fully gapped superconductor predicts an exponential dependence, which means $\\lambda(T)$ becomes extremely flat and rapidly approaches $\\lambda(0)$ as $T \\to 0$. This exponential behavior is a direct consequence of the energy gap, which heavily suppresses thermal excitations at low temperatures. Experimental measurements on conventional (e.g., $s$-wave) superconductors confirm the exponential behavior, indicating that the empirical two-fluid model, while useful, does not capture the correct microscopic physics at very low temperatures. The power-law dependence predicted by the two-fluid model is a significantly weaker temperature dependence than the exponential freeze-out predicted by BCS theory.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\lambda(0)}{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{T}{T_c}\\right)^4}}}\n$$", "id": "3009515"}, {"introduction": "Our exploration now extends to the behavior of superconductors in the presence of both an external magnetic field and material disorder, a common scenario in real-world materials.

By direct comparison, we identify the square of the temperature-dependent GL coherence length in the dirty limit:\n$$\n\\xi(T)^2 = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar D}{8 k_B (T_c-T)}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that disorder modifies the coherence length through the diffusion constant $D$. The characteristic temperature dependence $\\xi(T) \\propto (T_c-T)^{-1/2}$ is preserved.\n\nFinally, we determine the upper critical field $B_{c2}(T)$. $B_{c2}$ is the maximum magnetic field at which a superconducting state can nucleate. Mathematically, this corresponds to finding the lowest possible eigenvalue of the operator on the left-hand side of the GL equation for a given field $B$, and this determines the highest temperature $T$ (closest to $T_c$) at which a non-trivial solution $\\Delta \\neq 0$ can exist.\nThe GL equation can be written as an eigenvalue problem:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2m^*}\\left(-i\\hbar\\nabla - 2e\\mathbf{A}\\right)^2 \\Delta(\\mathbf{r}) = \\alpha_0(T_c-T) \\Delta(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere we have identified $\\frac{1}{2m^*} \\leftrightarrow \\frac{\\pi D}{8k_B T_c \\hbar}$ and $\\alpha_0 \\leftrightarrow \\frac{1}{T_c}$.\nThe operator $\\frac{1}{2m^*}\\left(-i\\hbar\\nabla - 2e\\mathbf{A}\\right)^2$ is the kinetic energy operator for a particle of charge $2e$ and mass $m^*$. Its eigenvalues in a uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ are quantized into Landau levels. For a field $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{z}$, the lowest eigenvalue of the operator corresponds to the lowest Landau level ($n=0$). The lowest eigenvalue of the operator $(-i\\hbar\\nabla - 2e\\mathbf{A})^2$ is $2e\\hbar B$.\nThe nucleation of superconductivity at $B_{c2}$ corresponds to a solution existing when the operator is replaced by this lowest eigenvalue. Substituting this into our derived GL equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi D}{8 k_B T_c \\hbar} \\left( 2e\\hbar B_{c2}(T) \\right) = \\frac{T_c-T}{T_c}\n$$\nThe factor $\\hbar$ cancels. We can now solve for $B_{c2}(T)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi e D B_{c2}(T)}{4 k_B T_c} = \\frac{T_c-T}{T_c} \\implies B_{c2}(T) = \\frac{4 k_B (T_c-T)}{\\pi e D}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final expression to be in terms of $D$, $\\hbar$, $k_B$, and the superconducting flux quantum $\\Phi_0 = h/(2e)$. We use this definition to eliminate the elementary charge $e$.\n$$\n\\Phi_0 = \\frac{h}{2e} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{2e} = \\frac{\\pi\\hbar}{e} \\implies e = \\frac{\\pi\\hbar}{\\Phi_0}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $B_{c2}(T)$:\n$$\nB_{c2}(T) = \\frac{4 k_B (T_c-T)}{\\pi D \\left(\\frac{\\pi\\hbar}{\\Phi_0}\\right)} = \\frac{4 k_B \\Phi_0 (T_c-T)}{\\pi^2 \\hbar D}\n$$\nThis expression gives the upper critical field $B_{c2}(T)$ near $T_c$, showing a linear dependence on $(T_c-T)$. Dimensionally, this expression yields units of magnetic field (Tesla in SI units). The proportionality constant is $\\frac{4 k_B \\Phi_0}{\\pi^2 \\hbar D}$.\nThis can also be confirmed by using the general relation $B_{c2}(T) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{2\\pi \\xi(T)^2}$ and substituting our derived expression for $\\xi(T)^2$:\n$$\nB_{c2}(T) = \\frac{\\Phi_0}{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\pi\\hbar D}{8 k_B (T_c-T)}} = \\frac{4 k_B \\Phi_0 (T_c-T)}{\\pi^2 \\hbar D}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same consistent result.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4 k_B \\Phi_0 (T_c-T)}{\\pi^2 \\hbar D}}\n$$", "id": "3009546"}]}
