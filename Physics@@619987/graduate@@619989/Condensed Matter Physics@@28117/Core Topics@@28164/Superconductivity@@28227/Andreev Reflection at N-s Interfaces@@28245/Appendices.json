In this approximation, the wavefunctions are written as products of rapidly oscillating plane waves $e^{\\pm ik_F x}$ and slowly varying envelope functions. A standard and powerful method, developed by Blonder, Tinkham, and Klapwijk (BTK), solves this scattering problem by relating the N-S interface properties to the known normal-state scattering properties of the barrier, characterized by the dimensionless strength $Z = H/(\\hbar v_F)$. The problem statement allows the use of such \"well-tested facts\".\n\nThe BTK model provides expressions for the Andreev reflection amplitude $a$ and the normal reflection amplitude $b$ for an electron incident from the normal metal. For $E < \\Delta$, there are no propagating quasiparticle states in the superconductor, so an incident electron is either normally reflected (as an electron) or Andreev reflected (as a hole).

For a transparent interface ($Z=0$), Andreev reflection is perfect, $A(0)=1$, as the electron perfectly converts to a hole. The presence of a barrier ($Z>0$) introduces a normal reflection channel that competes with Andreev reflection. The barrier suppresses the coupling, thus reducing the Andreev reflection probability. For a large barrier ($Z \\gg 1$), $A(0) \\approx 1/(4Z^4)$, indicating strong suppression.\n\n2.  **Limit as $E \\to \\Delta^-$ (from subgap energies)**:\n    In this limit, the term $(\\Delta^2 - E^2) \\to 0$.
