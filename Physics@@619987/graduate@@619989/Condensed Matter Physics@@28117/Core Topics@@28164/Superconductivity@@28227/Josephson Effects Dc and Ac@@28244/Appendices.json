The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics, specifically the theory of the Josephson effect. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nWe begin by modeling the two bulk superconductors on either side of the weak link as macroscopic quantum states, described by complex wavefunctions $\\Psi_1$ and $\\Psi_2$. Each wavefunction can be written in polar form as:\n$$ \\Psi_k = \\sqrt{n_k} \\exp(i\\phi_k) $$\nwhere $k$ is an index representing the superconductor ($1$ or $2$), $\\sqrt{n_k}$ is the amplitude related to the density of Cooper pairs, and $\\phi_k$ is the macroscopic quantum phase.\n\nThe problem states that the phase evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:\n$$ i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\Psi_k}{\\partial t} = E_k \\Psi_k $$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $E_k$ is the energy of the condensate in superconductor $k$. This energy $E_k$ is its electrochemical potential, $\\mu_k$.\n\nSubstituting the form of $\\Psi_k$ into the Schrödinger equation, and assuming the density $n_k$ is constant in time, we get:\n$$ i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\sqrt{n_k} \\exp(i\\phi_k)) = i\\hbar \\sqrt{n_k} (i \\frac{d\\phi_k}{dt}) \\exp(i\\phi_k) = -\\hbar \\frac{d\\phi_k}{dt} \\Psi_k $$\nComparing this with the original Schrödinger equation, we find:\n$$ -\\hbar \\frac{d\\phi_k}{dt} \\Psi_k = E_k \\Psi_k $$\nThis yields the equation for the time evolution of the phase:\n$$ \\hbar \\frac{d\\phi_k}{dt} = -E_k $$\n\nA constant voltage $V$ is applied across the junction, which means there is a difference in electric potential between the two superconductors. This potential difference imparts a difference in energy to the charge carriers, which are Cooper pairs with charge $q = -2e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. A more standard convention in this context is to consider the charge to be $2e$ and the voltage drop $V$ to be $V_1 - V_2$, such that the energy difference is $(2e)V$. The total energy difference between the two condensates is therefore the difference in their electrochemical potentials, which is directly related to the voltage:\n$$ E_1 - E_2 = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 2eV $$\n\nThe crucial quantity for the Josephson effect is the gauge-invariant phase difference across the weak link, defined as $\\delta = \\phi_2 - \\phi_1$. We can find its rate of change by differentiating with respect to time:\n$$ \\frac{d\\delta}{dt} = \\frac{d\\phi_2}{dt} - \\frac{d\\phi_1}{dt} $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived from the Schrödinger equation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\delta}{dt} = \\frac{-E_2}{\\hbar} - \\frac{-E_1}{\\hbar} = \\frac{E_1 - E_2}{\\hbar} $$\nNow, we use the energy difference due to the voltage bias:\n$$ \\frac{d\\delta}{dt} = \\frac{2eV}{\\hbar} $$\nThis is the second Josephson relation. It shows that a constant voltage bias causes the phase difference to evolve linearly with time. Integrating this equation gives:\n$$ \\delta(t) = \\delta(0) + \\frac{2eV}{\\hbar}t $$\nwhere $\\delta(0)$ is the initial phase difference at $t=0$.\n\nThe problem states that the supercurrent $I_s$ through the junction is a $2\\pi$-periodic function of the phase difference $\\delta$. The first Josephson relation gives this dependence explicitly as $I_s = I_c \\sin(\\delta)$, where $I_c$ is the critical current of the junction. Substituting the time-dependent phase difference, we get:\n$$ I_s(t) = I_c \\sin\\left(\\delta(0) + \\frac{2eV}{\\hbar}t\\right) $$\nThis expression describes an alternating current (AC) with a constant angular frequency $\\omega$. By inspection, the angular frequency is the coefficient of $t$:\n$$ \\omega = \\frac{2eV}{\\hbar} $$\nThe frequency $f$ is related to the angular frequency by $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Therefore:\n$$ 2\\pi f = \\frac{2eV}{\\hbar} $$\nSolving for $f$ and using the relation $h = 2\\pi\\hbar$:\n$$ f = \\frac{2eV}{2\\pi\\hbar} = \\frac{2eV}{h} $$\nThis is the celebrated voltage-frequency relation for the AC Josephson effect.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given voltage $V = 1\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$.

It is a standard problem in the study of Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) and is based on the fundamental principles of the Josephson effect and magnetic flux quantization in superconductors. All provided information is consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system consists of two Josephson junctions, labeled $1$ and $2$, integrated into a superconducting loop. The current-phase relationship for each junction is given by the first Josephson equation:\n$$I_1 = I_{c1} \\sin(\\delta_1)$$\n$$I_2 = I_{c2} \\sin(\\delta_2)$$\nwhere $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the supercurrents through the junctions, $I_{c1}$ and $I_{c2}$ are the individual critical currents, and $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are the gauge-invariant phase differences of the macroscopic wavefunctions across the junctions.\n\nThe total bias current $I$ applied to the SQUID is the sum of the currents through the two parallel junctions:\n$$I = I_1 + I_2 = I_{c1} \\sin(\\delta_1) + I_{c2} \\sin(\\delta_2)$$\n\nThe phase differences $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are not independent. The phase of a superconducting wavefunction must be single-valued. Integrating the gradient of the phase around the closed loop gives a change that must be a multiple of $2\\pi$. This leads to the flux quantization condition, which relates the phase differences to the total magnetic flux $\\Phi_{\\text{tot}}$ threading the loop:\n$$\\delta_2 - \\delta_1 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{tot}}}{\\Phi_0}$$\nwhere $\\Phi_0 = h/(2e)$ is the magnetic flux quantum, with $h$ being Planck's constant and $e$ the elementary charge.\n\nThe total flux $\\Phi_{\\text{tot}}$ is the sum of the externally applied flux $\\Phi$ and the self-induced flux $\\Phi_{\\text{ind}} = L J$, where $L$ is the loop inductance and $J$ is the circulating current. The problem states that the screening parameter $2\\pi L I_c / \\Phi_0 \\ll 1$, which corresponds to the limit of negligible loop inductance ($L \\approx 0$). In this limit, the self-induced flux is negligible compared to $\\Phi_0$, and we can approximate $\\Phi_{\\text{tot}} \\approx \\Phi$. The phase constraint simplifies to:\n$$\\delta_2 - \\delta_1 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\Phi}{\\Phi_0}$$\n\nWe can now express the total current $I$ as a function of a single phase variable, say $\\delta_1$.

In the zero-bias limit, $U(\\phi) = -E_J \\cos\\phi$, which has minima at $\\phi_0 = 2n\\pi$ for any integer $n$. We choose the principal value $\\phi_0 = 0$.\nIn this stable equilibrium, as $I_b \\to 0$, we have $\\phi_0 \\to 0$. Therefore:\n$$\\cos\\phi_0 \\to \\cos(0) = 1$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the critical $\\beta_c$:\n$$\\beta_c^{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{1}{4(1)} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThus, the precise critical value of the Stewart–McCumber parameter that separates overdamped and underdamped dynamics in the zero-bias limit is $1/4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n$$", "id": "2997659"}]}
