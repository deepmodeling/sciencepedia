The solution involves analyzing this equation as an eigenvalue problem and relating its solutions to the Landau level quantization of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field.\n\nThe starting point is the linearized GL equation:\n$$\n\\alpha\\,\\psi + \\frac{1}{2 m^*} \\left( - i \\hbar \\nabla - q \\mathbf{A} \\right)^2 \\psi = 0\n$$\nHere, $\\psi$ is the complex order parameter, $\\alpha$ is a temperature-dependent GL coefficient, $m^*$ is the effective mass of a Cooper pair, $q$ is its charge, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\mathbf{A}$ is the magnetic vector potential for a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $H$.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation into the form of a time-independent Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2 m^*} \\left( - i \\hbar \\nabla - q \\mathbf{A} \\right)^2 \\psi = -\\alpha \\psi\n$$\nThis is an eigenvalue equation for the kinetic energy operator $\\hat{H}_{\\text{kin}} = \\frac{1}{2 m^*} \\left( - i \\hbar \\nabla - q \\mathbf{A} \\right)^2$. For a non-trivial solution $\\psi \\neq 0$ to exist, the value $-\\alpha$ must be one of the eigenvalues of this operator. The operator $\\hat{H}_{\\text{kin}}$ is mathematically equivalent to the Hamiltonian of a quantum particle of mass $m^*$ and charge $q$ in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$. The problem specifies a uniform magnetic field of magnitude $H$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are the well-known Landau levels. For motion confined to the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, the energy eigenvalues are given by:\n$$\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_c \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right), \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_c$ is the cyclotron frequency. The charge of a Cooper pair is $q=2e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. Thus, the cyclotron frequency is:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{|q|H}{m^*} = \\frac{2eH}{m^*}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the energy eigenvalue equation, we get:\n$$\nE_n = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{2eH}{m^*} \\right) \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n$$\nIn a three-dimensional system, we must also account for the kinetic energy of motion parallel to the field, $p_z^2 / (2m^*)$. The full spectrum is $E_{n, p_z} = E_n + p_z^2 / (2m^*)$. For a superconducting state to form, $-\\alpha$ must be equal to one of these energy eigenvalues. The onset of superconductivity corresponds to the lowest possible energy state of the system, which occurs for the lowest Landau level ($n=0$) and zero momentum along the field ($p_z=0$). The minimum eigenvalue of the kinetic operator is therefore:\n$$\nE_{\\min} = E_{n=0} = \\frac{1}{2} \\hbar \\omega_c = \\frac{\\hbar e H}{m^*}\n$$\nFor a solution to exist, we must have $-\\alpha \\ge E_{\\min}$, which implies $\\alpha$ must be negative. This is consistent with the physics of the GL theory, where $\\alpha < 0$ in the superconducting phase. If $\\alpha \\ge 0$, no solution is possible, and thus $H_{c2} = 0$, as stated in the problem.\n\nFor a fixed $\\alpha < 0$, the condition $-\\alpha = E_n$ (with $p_z=0$) defines a set of magnetic field values $H_n$ for which a superconducting solution associated with the $n$-th Landau level can exist:\n$$\n-\\alpha = \\hbar \\left( \\frac{2eH_n}{m^*} \\right) \\left( n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $H_n$, we obtain the candidate magnetic fields:\n$$\nH_n = \\frac{-\\alpha m^*}{2e\\hbar} \\frac{1}{n + 1/2}\n$$\nThe upper critical field, $H_{c2}$, is defined as the *maximal* magnetic field that the superconductor can withstand. Therefore, we must find the maximum value of $H_n$ over all allowed Landau-level indices $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n$$\nH_{c2} = \\max_{n \\ge 0} \\{ H_n \\} = \\max_{n \\ge 0} \\left\\{ \\frac{-\\alpha m^*}{2e\\hbar} \\frac{1}{n + 1/2} \\right\\}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha < 0$, the term $\\frac{-\\alpha m^*}{2e\\hbar}$ is a positive constant. The expression for $H_n$ is maximized when the term $1/(n+1/2)$ is maximized. This occurs when the denominator $n+1/2$ is minimized. The minimum value of $n$ is $0$.\n\nThus, the maximum field value corresponds to the lowest Landau level, $n=0$:\n$$\nH_{c2} = H_{n=0} = \\frac{-\\alpha m^*}{2e\\hbar \\left(0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{-\\alpha m^*}{e\\hbar}\n$$\nThe problem's instruction to \"search across Landau-level indices\" is resolved analytically; the maximum is definitively found at $n=0$.\n\nThe computational algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Define the necessary physical constants: electron mass $m_e$, elementary charge $e$, and reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$.\n2.  For each test case, given by parameters $m^*$ and $\\alpha$:\n3.  Check if $\\alpha \\ge 0$. If it is, the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ is $0$.\n4.  If $\\alpha < 0$, calculate $H_{c2}$ using the derived formula: $H_{c2} = \\frac{-\\alpha m^*}{e\\hbar}$.\n5.

Therefore, the expression for the lower critical field is:\n$$\n\\mu_{0} H_{c1}(T) = \\frac{\\Phi_{0}}{4\\pi\\lambda(T)^2} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\kappa(T)\\right) + c \\right]\n$$\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- $T_{c} = 18.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- At $T_1 = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$: $\\lambda(T_1) = 160\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1.60 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\xi(T_1) = 4.00\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- At $T_2 = 17.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$: $\\lambda(T_2) = 420\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 4.20 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\xi(T_2) = 10.00\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- $\\Phi_{0} = 2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{Wb}$.\n- $c = 0.50$.\n\nFirst, we compute the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\\kappa(T)$ at both temperatures.\nAt $T_1 = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\n\\kappa(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{\\lambda(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K})}{\\xi(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{160\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{4.00\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 40.0\n$$\nAt $T_2 = 17.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\n\\kappa(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{\\lambda(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K})}{\\xi(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{420\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{10.00\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = 42.0\n$$\nSince both values of $\\kappa$ are much greater than $1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.707$, the material is indeed a strong type-II superconductor, validating the use of the chosen formulas.\n\nNext, we compute the critical fields at both temperatures.\nAt $T_1 = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{0} H_{c2}(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{\\Phi_{0}}{2\\pi \\xi(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K})^2} = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{Wb}}{2\\pi (4.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} \\approx 20.57\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{0} H_{c1}(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{\\Phi_{0}}{4\\pi\\lambda(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K})^2} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\kappa(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\right) + 0.50 \\right] = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{Wb}}{4\\pi (1.60 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} \\left[ \\ln(40.0) + 0.50 \\right] \\approx 0.0269\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\n\nAt $T_2 = 17.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{0} H_{c2}(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{\\Phi_{0}}{2\\pi \\xi(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K})^2} = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{Wb}}{2\\pi (1.00 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} \\approx 3.29\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{0} H_{c1}(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K}) = \\frac{\\Phi_{0}}{4\\pi\\lambda(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K})^2} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\kappa(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\right) + 0.50 \\right] = \\frac{2.067833848 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{Wb}}{4\\pi (4.20 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} \\left[ \\ln(42.0) + 0.50 \\right] \\approx 0.00395\\,\\mathrm{T}\n$$\nThe critical fields decrease as temperature increases towards $T_c$, which is the expected physical behavior.\n\nNow, we discuss the temperature dependence of $\\kappa(T)$. Ginzburg-Landau theory is formally valid in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$. In this limit, both $\\lambda(T)$ and $\\xi(T)$ are predicted to diverge as $(1 - T/T_c)^{-1/2}$. Consequently, their ratio, $\\kappa(T) = \\lambda(T)/\\xi(T)$, is expected to be independent of temperature.\nThe experimental data yield $\\kappa(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 40.0$ and $\\kappa(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 42.0$. The temperatures correspond to reduced temperatures $t_1 = 12.0/18.0 \\approx 0.67$ and $t_2 = 17.0/18.0 \\approx 0.94$.\nThe measurement at $T_2=17.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is very close to $T_c$ and should be well-described by GL theory. The measurement at $T_1=12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is significantly lower. The observation that $\\kappa(T)$ is not constant between these two temperatures indicates that the behavior of this superconductor is inconsistent with the simplest Ginzburg-Landau prediction of a temperature-independent $\\kappa$. Such temperature dependence is, however, known to occur in real materials due to effects not captured by the simplest GL theory, such as strong coupling corrections or impurity scattering effects (though the problem specifies a \"clean\" superconductor, where such effects are often presumed to be minimal). The data show that $\\kappa$ decreases as temperature moves away from $T_c$.\n\nFinally, we compute the fractional deviation $\\delta\\kappa$ as defined in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\delta\\kappa \\equiv \\frac{\\kappa(12.0\\,\\mathrm{K}) - \\kappa(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K})}{\\kappa(17.0\\,\\mathrm{K})}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $\\kappa(T)$:\n$$\n\\delta\\kappa = \\frac{40.0 - 42.0}{42.0} = \\frac{-2.0}{42.0} = -\\frac{1}{21}\n$$\nAs a decimal number, this is approximately $-0.047619047...$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $-0.04762$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-0.04762}\n$$", "id": "3002075"}]}
