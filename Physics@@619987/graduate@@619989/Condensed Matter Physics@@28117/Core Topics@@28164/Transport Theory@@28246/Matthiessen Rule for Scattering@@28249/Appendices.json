In its simplest form, it treats electrons as a classical gas and does not consider electron-electron interactions, as they are assumed to conserve the total momentum of the electron gas. If two electrons with momentum $\\vec{p}_{1}$ and $\\vec{p}_{2}$ scatter to final momenta $\\vec{p}_{3}$ and $\\vec{p}_{4}$, momentum conservation implies $\\vec{p}_{1}+\\vec{p}_{2} = \\vec{p}_{3}+\\vec{p}_{4}$. The total momentum of the electron subsystem, and thus the current it carries, is unaffected. Therefore, in a simple Galilean-invariant system (a free-electron gas), electron-electron scattering does not contribute to resistivity.\n\nThe observation of a $\\rho \\propto T^{2}$ term is a hallmark of **Fermi liquid theory**, a quantum mechanical description of interacting electrons in metals at low temperatures. In this framework, the $T^{2}$ dependence arises from Pauli exclusion. For an electron to scatter, both the initial and final states must be available. At low temperature $T$, only electrons within an energy window of $\\sim k_B T$ around the Fermi surface can participate in scattering. The number of available initial states is proportional to $T$, and the number of available final states is also proportional to $T$. This leads to a scattering rate that scales as $T^{2}$.\n\nFor electron-electron scattering to contribute to resistivity (i.e., to relax the total current), momentum must be transferred out of the electron system to the crystal lattice. This can occur via two primary mechanisms in a single-band metal:\n1.  **Umklapp Scattering**: In a periodic crystal lattice, momentum is conserved only up to a reciprocal lattice vector $\\vec{G}$. An electron-electron scattering event is called an Umklapp process if $\\vec{k}_{1} + \\vec{k}_{2} = \\vec{k}_{3} + \\vec{k}_{4} + \\vec{G}$, where $\\vec{G} \\neq \\vec{0}$. In such a process, momentum $\\hbar\\vec{G}$ is transferred to the lattice, thus degrading the total current and contributing to resistivity. Umklapp scattering is possible only if the Fermi surface is large enough or complex enough to allow for such processes.\n2.  **Band Structure Effects**: Even in non-Umklapp scattering, if the band structure is not a perfect parabola (i.e., the energy-momentum relation is non-trivial), the relationship between current and total electron momentum ($ \\vec{J} = \\sum_i q_i \\vec{v}_i = \\sum_i q_i \\nabla_{\\vec{p}_i} E(\\vec{p}_i) $) is more complex. Rearrangement of momentum among electrons on a non-parabolic Fermi surface can alter the total current, leading to a finite resistivity contribution from electron-electron scattering.\n\nIn summary, the use of the Drude formula $\\rho = (m/ne^2)\\Gamma$ to analyze the $A T^{2}$ resistivity is a phenomenological extension. The formula provides a valid framework to connect the macroscopic resistivity to a microscopic scattering rate, but the origin and temperature dependence of that rate ($\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{ee}} \\propto T^{2}$) must be justified by a more sophisticated quantum theory, namely Fermi liquid theory, and requires mechanisms like Umklapp scattering to be active.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{A T^{2}}{\\rho_{0}}}$$", "id": "2982995"}]}
