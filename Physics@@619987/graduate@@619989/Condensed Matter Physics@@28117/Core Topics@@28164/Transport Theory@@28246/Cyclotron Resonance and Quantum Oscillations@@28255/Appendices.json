Since $\\mathbf{B}$ is along the $\\hat{z}$-direction, this second surface is a plane of constant $k_z$.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the cross-sectional area $A(E, k_z)$**\n\nThe orbit in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is described by the set of points $(k_x, k_y)$ that satisfy the energy conservation equation for a fixed energy $E$ and a fixed momentum component $k_z$. We can rearrange the dispersion relation to find the equation for this orbit:\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2}\\left(\\frac{k_{x}^{2}}{m_{x}} + \\frac{k_{y}^{2}}{m_{y}} + \\frac{k_{z}^{2}}{m_{z}}\\right)\n$$\nIsolating the terms involving $k_x$ and $k_y$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2}\\left(\\frac{k_{x}^{2}}{m_{x}} + \\frac{k_{y}^{2}}{m_{y}}\\right) = E - \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k_{z}^{2}}{2m_{z}}\n$$\nFor a closed orbit to exist, the kinetic energy associated with the motion in the $k_x$-$k_y$ plane must be positive.

The energy spacing between adjacent Landau levels, $\\Delta E = \\hbar\\omega_c = \\hbar \\frac{eB}{m_c}$, can be related to the k-space area of the orbit, $A$.

The electron's energy $\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k})$ is conserved, so its trajectory in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is confined to a constant-energy surface. The Lorentz force causes the electron to precess on this surface. The trajectory, or orbit, in $\\mathbf{k}$-space is the intersection of the constant-energy surface $\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = \\varepsilon$ and a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field, e.g., $k_z = \\text{constant}$ for $\\mathbf{B} = B \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nThe cyclotron period $T_c$ is the time required to complete one such orbit. It can be written as an integral over the path length $dl_k$ of the orbit in $\\mathbf{k}$-space:\n$$ T_c = \\oint dt = \\oint \\frac{dl_k}{|d\\mathbf{k}/dt|} $$\nFrom the equation of motion, $|d\\mathbf{k}/dt| = \\frac{e}{\\hbar} |\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}| = \\frac{eBv_{\\perp}}{\\hbar}$, where $v_{\\perp}$ is the component of the velocity perpendicular to $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\nThus, $T_c = \\frac{\\hbar}{eB} \\oint \\frac{dl_k}{v_{\\perp}}$.

The extremal cross-sectional area $A(\\varepsilon)$ of the Fermi surface is quantized as:\n$$ A(\\varepsilon_n) = \\frac{2\\pi e B}{\\hbar} (n + \\gamma) $$\nwhere $n$ is an integer (the Landau level index) and $\\gamma$ is a phase offset. Quantum oscillations in physical properties (such as resistivity or magnetization) occur as the magnetic field $B$ is varied, causing successive Landau levels to pass through the Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_F$. A property will show an extremum whenever a Landau level $\\varepsilon_n$ coincides with $\\varepsilon_F$. This occurs for magnetic field values $B_n$ that satisfy:\n$$ A(\\varepsilon_F) = \\frac{2\\pi e B_n}{\\hbar} (n + \\gamma) $$\nRearranging for the inverse magnetic field $1/B_n$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{B_n} = \\frac{2\\pi e}{\\hbar A(\\varepsilon_F)} (n + \\gamma) $$\nThis equation shows that the oscillations are periodic in $1/B$. The period of these oscillations, $\\Delta(1/B)$, is the change in $1/B$ when $n$ changes by $1$:\n$$ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{B}\\right) = \\frac{1}{B_{n}} - \\frac{1}{B_{n-1}} = \\frac{2\\pi e}{\\hbar A(\\varepsilon_F)} ((n+\\gamma) - (n-1+\\gamma)) = \\frac{2\\pi e}{\\hbar A(\\varepsilon_F)} $$\nThe Onsager frequency $F$ is defined as the inverse of this period:\n$$ F(\\varepsilon_F) = \\left[ \\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{B}\\right) \\right]^{-1} = \\frac{\\hbar A(\\varepsilon_F)}{2\\pi e} $$\nThis expression demonstrates that the Onsager frequency, and thus the periodicity of quantum oscillations, is directly proportional to the extremal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface $A(\\varepsilon_F)$. The phase factor $\\gamma$, which contains the Berry phase contribution, affects the absolute position (phase) of the oscillation peaks in a plot versus $1/B$, but it does not affect their spacing. Therefore, a nontrivial Berry phase does not modify the Onsager frequency $F(\\varepsilon_F)$.\n\nUsing the area for the Weyl semimetal, $A(\\varepsilon_F) = \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon_F^2}{\\hbar^2 v_F^2}$, we find the Onsager frequency:\n$$ F(\\varepsilon_F) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\pi e} \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon_F^2}{\\hbar^2 v_F^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\varepsilon_F^2}{2e\\hbar v_F^2} $$\n\n4.

The problem specifies including a Maslov correction and a Berry phase. The total phase offset can be written as:\n$$ \\gamma = \\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}} - \\frac{\\Phi_B}{2\\pi} $$\nFor a standard three-dimensional extremal orbit (e.g., in a parabolic band), the Maslov correction corresponds to a phase factor $\\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}}=1/2$. The problem states that this correction is the same for both the Weyl and the trivial parabolic band.\n\nFor the trivial parabolic band, the Berry phase is $\\Phi_B = 0$. The phase offset is:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\text{trivial}} = \\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}} - \\frac{0}{2\\pi} = \\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}} $$\nFor the Weyl semimetal, the cyclotron orbit at $k_z=0$ encloses the Weyl node at $\\mathbf{k}=0$. The associated Berry phase is given as $\\Phi_B = \\pi$. The phase offset is:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\text{Weyl}} = \\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}} - \\frac{\\pi}{2\\pi} = \\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}} - \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe shift in the quantum-oscillation phase offset is the difference $\\Delta \\gamma \\equiv \\gamma_{\\text{Weyl}} - \\gamma_{\\text{trivial}}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\gamma = \\left(\\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\gamma_{\\text{Maslov}} = -\\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe non-trivial Berry phase of $\\pi$ in the Weyl semimetal results in a phase shift of $-1/2$ in the quantum oscillations compared to a topologically trivial band with the same Fermi surface geometry.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the three derived quantities: $\\omega_{c}(\\varepsilon_{F}, B)$, $F(\\varepsilon_{F})$, and $\\Delta \\gamma$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{e B v_{F}^{2}}{\\varepsilon_{F}} & \\frac{\\varepsilon_{F}^{2}}{2e\\hbar v_{F}^{2}} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2980362"}]}
