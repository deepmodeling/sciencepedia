The derivation must start from fundamental principles and explicitly show the connection to the Fermi surface area.\n\nFirst, we consider the quantization of electron motion in a perpendicular magnetic field $B$. For a 2DEG with a parabolic dispersion relation $E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*}$, where $m^*$ is the effective mass, the continuous energy spectrum coalesces into a series of discrete Landau levels (LLs) with energies given by:\n$$E_{\\ell} = \\left(\\ell + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\hbar \\omega_c$$\nwhere $\\ell = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$ is the Landau level index and $\\omega_c = \\frac{eB}{m^*}$ is the cyclotron frequency.\n\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations in resistivity arise from the periodic modulation of the density of states at the Fermi energy, $E_F$, as the magnetic field $B$ is varied. A maximum in the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}$ occurs each time a Landau level crosses the Fermi energy. The condition for this is $E_F = E_{\\ell}$ for some integer $\\ell$. We can write this condition more generally as:\n$$E_F = \\left(\\ell + \\gamma\\right) \\hbar \\omega_c = \\left(\\ell + \\gamma\\right) \\frac{\\hbar e B}{m^*}$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is a phase factor, which is $1/2$ for this simple model but can deviate. The precise value of $\\gamma$ does not affect the oscillation period. The integer $\\ell$ represents the index of the highest occupied Landau level. This equation can be rearranged to express the value of the inverse magnetic field, $1/B$, at which these crossings occur:\n$$\\frac{1}{B_{\\ell}} = \\frac{e\\hbar}{m^* E_F} (\\ell + \\gamma)$$\nThis equation shows that the resistivity maxima are periodic in $1/B$. The period of these oscillations, $\\Delta(1/B)$, is the change in $1/B$ corresponding to a change of unity in the index $\\ell$:\n$$\\Delta\\left(\\frac{1}{B}\\right) = \\frac{1}{B_{\\ell}} - \\frac{1}{B_{\\ell-1}} = \\frac{e\\hbar}{m^* E_F}\\left[(\\ell + \\gamma) - (\\ell-1 + \\gamma)\\right] = \\frac{e\\hbar}{m^* E_F}$$\nThe oscillation frequency $F$ is defined as the reciprocal of this period:\n$$F = \\frac{1}{\\Delta(1/B)} = \\frac{m^* E_F}{e\\hbar}$$\n\nNext, we connect this frequency $F$ to the area of the Fermi surface in momentum space (k-space), $A_F$, as required. At zero magnetic field, the Fermi energy for a 2DEG with a circular Fermi contour is related to the Fermi wavevector $k_F$ by $E_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m^*}$. Substituting this expression for $E_F$ into our equation for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{m^*}{e\\hbar} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m^*} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar k_F^2}{2e}$$\nThe area of the circular Fermi surface in k-space is $A_F = \\pi k_F^2$. Thus, $k_F^2 = A_F/\\pi$. Substituting this into the expression for $F$ yields the direct relationship between the oscillation frequency and the Fermi surface area, known as the Onsager relation for two dimensions:\n$$F = \\frac{\\hbar}{2e} \\left( \\frac{A_F}{\\pi} \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\pi e} A_F$$\nThis explicitly connects the measurable frequency $F$ to the extremal cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface.\n\nFinally, we relate the Fermi surface area $A_F$ to the carrier density $n_e$. The total number of electronic states per unit area in k-space is given by $\\frac{g_s g_v}{(2\\pi)^2}$, where $g_s$ is the spin degeneracy and $g_v$ is the valley degeneracy. The problem specifies a single-valley 2DEG, so $g_v=1$. For the derivation of the dominant frequency, we must account for all carriers, which are typically spin-degenerate. We therefore make the standard assumption that each k-state can be occupied by two electrons (spin-up and spin-down), so we take $g_s=2$. The total carrier density $n_e$ is the density of states in k-space multiplied by the area of occupied states, which is the Fermi area $A_F$:\n$$n_e = \\frac{g_s g_v}{(2\\pi)^2} A_F = \\frac{2 \\times 1}{4\\pi^2} A_F = \\frac{A_F}{2\\pi^2}$$\nWe now have two independent relations involving $A_F$: $F = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\pi e} A_F$ and $n_e = \\frac{A_F}{2\\pi^2}$. We can eliminate $A_F$ to find the desired expression for $n_e$ in terms of $F$. From the second equation, we have $A_F = 2\\pi^2 n_e$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$F = \\frac{\\hbar}{2\\pi e} (2\\pi^2 n_e) = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar n_e}{e}$$\nUsing the definition of the reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi)$, we get:\n$$F = \\frac{\\pi (h/2\\pi) n_e}{e} = \\frac{h n_e}{2e}$$\nRearranging for the carrier density $n_e$, we arrive at the final expression:\n$$n_e = \\frac{2e}{h} F$$\nThis expression relates the experimentally measured SdH frequency $F$ directly to the carrier density $n_e$.\n\nThe reason this expression for $n_e$ is insensitive to whether spin splitting is resolved is that the dominant frequency $F$ is a direct measure of the extremal area of the Fermi surface at zero magnetic field, $A_F$, via the Onsager relation. The carrier density $n_e$ is also determined by this same zero-field Fermi area $A_F$. Both relations, $F \\propto A_F$ and $n_e \\propto A_F$, are fundamental and depend only on the total number of occupied states, irrespective of how these states are grouped into sub-bands by effects like Zeeman splitting at finite magnetic fields. Thus, the derived relationship $n_e = \\frac{2e}{h}F$ holds regardless of whether the spin degeneracy is lifted and resolved in the experimental data.\n\nIf spin splitting becomes resolved, meaning the Zeeman energy $\\Delta E_Z = g \\mu_B B$ is comparable to or larger than the Landau level spacing $\\hbar \\omega_c$, the single series of spin-degenerate Landau levels splits into two separate series for spin-up and spin-down electrons. Since both spin populations originate from the same zero-field Fermi surface, they oscillate with the same fundamental frequency $F$. However, the Zeeman splitting introduces a relative phase shift between the two oscillatory components. The resulting signal is a superposition of two oscillations of the same frequency but different phase, which leads to a beat pattern. Qualitatively, this manifests as a splitting of each SdH peak into a doublet, or as nodes in the oscillation amplitude where destructive interference occurs. The single Fourier peak at $F$ remains dominant, but its amplitude may be modulated, and harmonics (especially at $2F$) may become more prominent.\n\nNow we perform the calculation.
