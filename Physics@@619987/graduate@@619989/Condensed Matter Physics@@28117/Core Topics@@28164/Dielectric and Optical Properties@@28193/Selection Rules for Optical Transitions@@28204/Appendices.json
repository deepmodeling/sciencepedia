The symbol $\\begin{pmatrix} l' & 1 & l \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ is non-zero only if the sum of the top row numbers, $l' + 1 + l$, is an even integer. This corresponds to the parity selection rule. The parity of the state $|lm\\rangle$ is $(-1)^l$. For the matrix element $\\langle l'm'|\\mathbf{r}|lm\\rangle$ to be non-zero, the overall parity of the integrand must be even. The operator $\\mathbf{r}$ has odd parity ($-1$), so we require $(-1)^{l'} (-1)^1 (-1)^l = 1$, which means $l'+l+1$ must be even.

To present it in a standard form, we can use the symmetry property of the $3j$-symbol: $\\begin{pmatrix} l' & 1 & l \\\\ -m' & q & m \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)^{l'+1+l} \\begin{pmatrix} l & 1 & l' \\\\ m & q & -m' \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $l'+1+l$ is even for allowed transitions, this simplifies to $\\begin{pmatrix} l & 1 & l' \\\\ m & q & -m' \\end{pmatrix}$.

The transition is from an initial state $|i\\rangle=|n, \\mathbf{k}_{\\star}\\rangle$ to a final state $|f\\rangle=|n', \\mathbf{k}_{\\star}\\rangle$ at an inversion-invariant momentum $\\mathbf{k}_{\\star}$.\n\n*   **Centrosymmetric case**: The initial and final states are parity eigenstates with eigenvalues $p_i$ and $p_f$. The transition operator is the electric-dipole operator $\\hat{O}_{\\gamma}$, which is given as odd ($p_{\\gamma}=-1$). The selection rule is $p_f \\cdot p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_i = +1$. Substituting $p_{\\gamma}=-1$, we get $p_f \\cdot (-1) \\cdot p_i = +1$, which simplifies to $p_f p_i = -1$. This means the initial and final states must have opposite parity for the transition to be allowed. The first part of the statement is correct.\n*   **Non-centrosymmetric case**: In a non-centrosymmetric crystal, the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ does not commute with the parity operator $\\hat{P}$. Therefore, the Bloch eigenstates are not, in general, eigenstates of parity. Parity is not a \"good quantum number\". The concept of a parity selection rule does not apply, and transitions are governed by other symmetries of the crystal's point group. A transition that is forbidden by parity in a centrosymmetric material (e.g., between states that would have the same parity) is not subject to this restriction and may be allowed. The second part of the statement is also correct.\n\nTherefore, the entire statement is a correct summary of parity selection rules for direct single-photon transitions.\n\n**Verdict for A**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\nThis statement makes an absolute claim about absorption in indirect-gap centrosymmetric semiconductors like silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge).\n\nThe statement claims absorption is \"strictly forbidden to all orders by parity\". This is a very strong claim. A \"first-order\" process (direct absorption) is forbidden at the band edge by crystal momentum conservation, as the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are at different $\\mathbf{k}$-vectors. The dominant absorption mechanism at the threshold is a \"second-order\" process involving a phonon. As we will see in the analysis of option C, such second-order processes are generally allowed by symmetry. The existence of an allowed second-order process immediately falsifies the claim that absorption is forbidden \"to all orders\".\n\nFurthermore, the statement gives a reason: \"because the initial and final band-edge states reside in bands of the same parity.\" For Si and Ge, the VBM is at the $\\Gamma$ point and has odd parity (derived from p-orbitals), while the CBM is near the X point (Si) or at the L point (Ge), and in both cases, the CBM state has even parity. Therefore, the premise of the reason given is factually incorrect for the examples cited.\n\nThus, the statement is incorrect both in its conclusion (forbidden to all orders) and in its specific premise about Si and Ge.\n\n**Verdict for B**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThis statement describes a mechanism for phonon-assisted absorption in a centrosymmetric indirect-gap semiconductor. This is a second-order process involving both the electron-photon operator $\\hat{O}_{\\gamma}$ and the electron-phonon operator $\\hat{O}_{\\text{ph}}$.\n\nThe effective operator for the transition can be thought of as a product of the two elementary operators. The statement proposes selecting a phonon branch with odd inversion character, meaning $\\chi = -1$ for the operator $\\hat{O}_{\\text{ph}}$. The electric-dipole operator $\\hat{O}_{\\gamma}$ is odd ($p_{\\gamma}=-1$). The parity of the combined effective operator, $p_{\\text{eff}}$, is the product of the parities of the constituent operators: $p_{\\text{eff}} = p_{\\text{ph}} \\cdot p_{\\gamma} = \\chi \\cdot p_{\\gamma} = (-1) \\cdot (-1) = +1$.\n\nSo, the effective operator for this specific process is even under inversion. The selection rule for an even operator is $p_f \\cdot p_{\\text{eff}} \\cdot p_i = +1$, which becomes $p_f \\cdot (+1) \\cdot p_i = +1$, or $p_f p_i = +1$. This means an even effective operator allows transitions between states of the same parity.\n\nThe statement correctly deduces that choosing an odd phonon leads to an even effective operator. It then correctly concludes that this allows coupling between band-edge states (specifically, those of the same parity). The existence of this valid physical mechanism demonstrates that phonon-assisted absorption is \"not forbidden\" by inversion symmetry, even if the direct transition is. While this particular mechanism (odd phonon) is for same-parity states and the mechanism for opposite-parity states would require an even phonon, the statement's logic is sound in establishing a pathway for absorption, thus proving it is not forbidden.\n\n**Verdict for C**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThis statement concerns direct two-photon absorption (TPA) in a centrosymmetric crystal. TPA is a second-order process involving two interactions with the electric-dipole operator $\\hat{O}_{\\gamma}$.\n\nThe transition path is from an initial state $|i\\rangle$ to a virtual intermediate state to a final state $|f\\rangle$. The effective operator for TPA, $\\hat{O}_{\\text{TPA}}$, involves two applications of $\\hat{O}_{\\gamma}$. The parity of this effective operator is the product of the parities of the two $\\hat{O}_{\\gamma}$ operators. Since $\\hat{O}_{\\gamma}$ is odd ($p_{\\gamma}=-1$), the parity of $\\hat{O}_{\\text{TPA}}$ is $p_{\\text{TPA}} = p_{\\gamma} \\cdot p_{\\gamma} = (-1) \\cdot (-1) = +1$.\n\nThe effective operator for TPA is even. The selection rule for an even operator, as derived before, is that the initial and final states must have the same parity ($p_f p_i = +1$).\n\nThe statement correctly identifies that the effective TPA operator is even and correctly concludes that it allows transitions between bands of the same parity at an inversion-invariant point $\\mathbf{k}_{\\star}$. It also correctly contrasts this with single-photon absorption, which requires opposite parity. The selection rules for one-photon and two-photon absorption are complementary in centrosymmetric systems.\n\n**Verdict for D**: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n\nThis statement discusses transitions in gallium arsenide (GaAs), a zinc blende semiconductor. The zinc blende structure is non-centrosymmetric. GaAs is a direct-gap semiconductor, meaning its VBM and CBM are both at the same point in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, the $\\Gamma$ point ($\\mathbf{k}=0$).\n\nThe statement claims that direct single-photon transitions are forbidden by \"translational symmetry because photon momentum is negligible.\" This fundamentally misinterprets the role of momentum conservation. Translational symmetry implies conservation of crystal momentum, $\\mathbf{k}' = \\mathbf{k} + \\mathbf{k}_{\\text{photon}}$. In the electric-dipole approximation, the photon momentum $\\mathbf{k}_{\\text{photon}}$ is considered negligible, so the selection rule becomes $\\mathbf{k}' = \\mathbf{k}$. This is the very definition of a direct or \"vertical\" transition.\n\nFor GaAs, the fundamental gap connects the VBM at $\\mathbf{k}=0$ to the CBM at $\\mathbf{k}'=0$. Since $\\mathbf{k}'=\\mathbf{k}=0$, the condition for a direct transition is perfectly met. Translational symmetry *allows* these transitions, it does not forbid them. The high efficiency of GaAs-based LEDs and lasers is a direct consequence of this allowed, momentum-conserving direct transition at the fundamental gap. The claim that only indirect transitions can occur is false.\n\n**Verdict for E**: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2982238"}]}
