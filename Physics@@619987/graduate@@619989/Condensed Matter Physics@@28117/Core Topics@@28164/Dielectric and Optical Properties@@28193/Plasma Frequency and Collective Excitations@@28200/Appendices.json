A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Plasma Frequency\n\nWe model the electron gas as a fluid. Let $n_0$ be the uniform equilibrium number density of electrons (given as $n$ in the problem, which we will use henceforth). The background positive charge density from the ion cores is $\\rho_{ion} = +en$, which ensures overall charge neutrality at equilibrium, since the equilibrium electron charge density is $\\rho_{e,0} = -en$.\n\nConsider a small, time- and space-dependent perturbation away from equilibrium.\nThe electron number density becomes $n(\\vec{r}, t) = n + \\delta n(\\vec{r}, t)$.\nThe electron fluid velocity is $\\vec{v}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\delta\\vec{v}(\\vec{r}, t)$, assuming the fluid is static at equilibrium $(\\vec{v}_0 = \\vec{0})$.\nThe local electron charge density is $\\rho_e(\\vec{r}, t) = -e n(\\vec{r}, t) = -e(n + \\delta n)$.\nThe total charge density is $\\rho_{total} = \\rho_e + \\rho_{ion} = -e(n + \\delta n) + en = -e\\,\\delta n(\\vec{r}, t)$.\nThis fluctuating charge density creates a small electric field $\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\delta\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t)$.\n\nWe now linearize the three fundamental equations for these small perturbations.\n\n1.  **Continuity Equation:**\n    The continuity equation for electron number is $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (n\\vec{v}) = 0$.\n    Substituting the perturbed quantities:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(n + \\delta n) + \\nabla \\cdot ((n + \\delta n)\\delta\\vec{v}) = 0$$\n    $$\\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (n\\,\\delta\\vec{v} + \\delta n\\,\\delta\\vec{v}) = 0$$\n    To first order in the small quantities $\\delta n$ and $\\delta\\vec{v}$ (neglecting the product $\\delta n\\,\\delta\\vec{v}$), we get:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial(\\delta n)}{\\partial t} + n \\nabla \\cdot (\\delta\\vec{v}) = 0 \\quad (1)$$\n\n2.  **Newton's Second Law (Equation of Motion):**\n    For an element of the electron fluid with mass $m_e$ and charge $-e$, the equation of motion is $m_e \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = -e\\vec{E}$. The problem specifies neglecting the force from electron pressure. The material derivative is $\\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial\\vec{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\vec{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\vec{v}$.\n    Substituting the perturbed quantities:\n    $$m_e \\left(\\frac{\\partial(\\delta\\vec{v})}{\\partial t} + (\\delta\\vec{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\delta\\vec{v}\\right) = -e\\,\\delta\\vec{E}$$\n    Linearizing by dropping the second-order term $(\\delta\\vec{v}\\cdot\\nabla)\\delta\\vec{v}$:\n    $$m_e \\frac{\\partial(\\delta\\vec{v})}{\\partial t} = -e\\,\\delta\\vec{E} \\quad (2)$$\n\n3.  **Gauss's Law:**\n    Gauss's law relates the electric field to the total charge density $\\rho_{total}$.\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = \\frac{\\rho_{total}}{\\epsilon_0}$$\n    Substituting the expressions for the perturbations:\n    $$\\nabla \\cdot (\\delta\\vec{E}) = \\frac{-e\\,\\delta n}{\\epsilon_0} \\quad (3)$$\n\nNow we combine these three linear partial differential equations. Take the time derivative of the continuity equation ($1$):\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2(\\delta n)}{\\partial t^2} + n \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial(\\delta\\vec{v})}{\\partial t}\\right) = 0$$\nSubstitute $\\frac{\\partial(\\delta\\vec{v})}{\\partial t}$ from the equation of motion ($2$):\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2(\\delta n)}{\\partial t^2} + n \\nabla \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{e}{m_e}\\delta\\vec{E}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2(\\delta n)}{\\partial t^2} - \\frac{ne}{m_e} \\nabla \\cdot (\\delta\\vec{E}) = 0$$\nFinally, substitute for $\\nabla \\cdot (\\delta\\vec{E})$ using Gauss's law ($3$):\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2(\\delta n)}{\\partial t^2} - \\frac{ne}{m_e} \\left(-\\frac{e\\,\\delta n}{\\epsilon_0}\\right) = 0$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2(\\delta n)}{\\partial t^2} + \\frac{ne^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0} \\delta n = 0$$\nThis is the equation of a simple harmonic oscillator for the density fluctuation $\\delta n$. The angular frequency $\\omega$ of this oscillation is given by the square root of the coefficient of the $\\delta n$ term.\n$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{ne^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}$$\nThus, the longitudinal collective mode frequency, known as the plasma frequency $\\omega_p$, is:\n$$\\omega = \\omega_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{ne^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}}$$\nThis result is independent of the wavevector $\\vec{k}$ in this long-wavelength approximation.\n\nThe characteristic quantum of this collective excitation (a plasmon) has an energy $\\hbar\\omega_p$.\n$$\\hbar\\omega_p = \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{ne^2}{m_e \\epsilon_0}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the characteristic quantum energy.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are asked to evaluate $\\hbar\\omega_p$ for the given parameters:\n- $n = 8 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n- $m^{*} = m_e = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- $\\epsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$\n- $\\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$\n\nFirst, we compute $\\omega_p^2$:\n$$\\omega_p^2 = \\frac{(8 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}})(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2}{(9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg})(8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}})}$$\n$$\\omega_p^2 \\approx \\frac{(8 \\times 10^{28})(2.56697 \\times 10^{-38})}{(9.10938 \\times 10^{-31})(8.85419 \\times 10^{-12})} \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}}$$\n$$\\omega_p^2 \\approx \\frac{2.053576 \\times 10^{-9}}{8.06584 \\times 10^{-42}} \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}} \\approx 2.54611 \\times 10^{32}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}$$\nThe plasma frequency $\\omega_p$ is:\n$$\\omega_p = \\sqrt{2.54611 \\times 10^{32}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}} \\approx 1.59565 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$$\nNow we calculate the plasmon energy $\\hbar\\omega_p$ in Joules:\n$$\\hbar\\omega_p = (1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}) \\times (1.59565 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})$$\n$$\\hbar\\omega_p \\approx 1.68269 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nFinally, we convert this energy to electronvolts (eV), using $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$:\n$$\\hbar\\omega_p (\\mathrm{in\\,eV}) = \\frac{1.68269 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}}$$\n$$\\hbar\\omega_p \\approx 10.5025\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\hbar\\omega_p \\approx 10.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10.50}$$", "id": "3010184"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the elemental cold plasma model, this practice introduces a crucial layer of physical realism: thermal motion.

Then\n$$\n\\Delta\\epsilon(\\theta;q)=\\frac{q^2}{2m}+v_F q \\cos\\theta,\n$$\nwhich takes its maximum and minimum at $\\cos\\theta=\\pm 1$, giving\n$$\n\\omega_+(q)=\\frac{q^2}{2m}+v_F q,\\qquad \\omega_-(q)=\\frac{q^2}{2m}-v_F q.\n$$\nAt $T=0$, energy absorption at positive frequency $\\omega>0$ is possible only if there exist occupied initial states and empty final states satisfying $\\Delta\\epsilon=\\omega$ with momentum transfer $\\mathbf{q}$. This kinematic analysis shows that a necessary condition is $\\omega\\in[\\max(0,\\omega_-(q)),\\omega_+(q)]$. When $\\omega_-(q)<0$ (which happens for $q<2k_F$ because $\\omega_-(q)=\\frac{q(q-2k_F)}{2m}$), the positive-frequency particle-hole continuum extends from $0$ up to $\\omega_+(q)$. For $q>2k_F$, both bounds are positive and the continuum is the interval $[\\omega_-(q),\\omega_+(q)]$. Inside this continuum, the response can create real particle-hole pairs and $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_0(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)\\neq 0$; outside it, the response is purely reactive with $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_0(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)=0$.\n\nLandau damping of a collective mode arises when the mode’s dispersion $\\omega(\\mathbf{q})$ lies within this particle-hole continuum, so that the mode can resonantly transfer energy to particle-hole excitations. Within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), the $3$D plasmon has a long-wavelength frequency $\\omega_p=\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi n e^2}{m}}$ that is nearly independent of $q$ for small $q$, while the upper boundary of the particle-hole continuum is $\\omega_+(q)\\approx v_F q$ at small $q$ (since $\\frac{q^2}{2m}$ is subleading). Therefore, for sufficiently small $q$, $\\omega_p\\gg v_F q$ and the plasmon lies above the continuum, implying $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_0(q,\\omega_p)=0$ and no Landau damping. As $q$ increases, the continuum broadens and its upper edge rises; Landau damping sets in near the wavevector $q^\\ast$ where the plasmon enters the continuum, approximated by solving\n$$\n\\omega_p=\\omega_+(q^\\ast)=\\frac{q^{\\ast 2}}{2m}+v_F q^\\ast.\n$$\nWhen $\\omega_p\\gg \\frac{q^{\\ast 2}}{2m}$, the quadratic term can be neglected, giving $q^\\ast\\approx \\omega_p/v_F$. This is the standard estimate for the onset of plasmon Landau damping in a $3$D electron gas.\n\nRegarding temperature, finite $T>0$ smears the Fermi surface and broadens the occupation factors, typically increasing the phase space for absorption at a given $\\omega$ and $q$ and hence enhancing (not eliminating) $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_0(q,\\omega)$ in and around the zero-temperature continuum. Landau damping is a collisionless mechanism: it does not require explicit scattering events; it arises from phase-space resonance between the collective mode and single-particle excitations.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This statement correctly ties $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_0(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ to kinematic availability of particle-hole excitations and gives the correct bounds $\\omega_{\\pm}(q)=\\frac{q^2}{2m}\\pm v_F q$, with the caveat about $\\omega_-(q)<0$ at small $q$. It correctly identifies that a collective mode within this interval is Landau damped. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This asserts that Landau damping requires collisions and vanishes in the collisionless limit. In fact, Landau damping is fundamentally collisionless, arising from resonant energy transfer to particle-hole excitations without scattering. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This uses the correct long-wavelength hierarchy $\\omega_p\\gg v_F q$ in $3$D and concludes $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_0(q,\\omega_p)=0$ for sufficiently small $q$, implying an undamped plasmon at long wavelengths. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. This describes the onset condition for damping by equating the plasmon frequency to the upper edge of the particle-hole continuum and gives the standard small-$q$ approximation $q^\\ast\\approx \\omega_p/v_F$ when $\\frac{q^{\\ast 2}}{2m}$ is negligible. Verdict: Correct.\n\nE. This claims that increasing $T$ suppresses Landau damping by making $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_0$ vanish. In reality, finite temperature broadens the response and tends to increase damping near and beyond the zero-temperature continuum rather than eliminate it.
