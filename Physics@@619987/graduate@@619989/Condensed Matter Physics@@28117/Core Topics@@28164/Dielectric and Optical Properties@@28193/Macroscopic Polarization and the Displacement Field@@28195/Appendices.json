It concerns a standard topic in the electromagnetism of continuous media.\n\nThe first task is to derive the general expression for the macroscopic bound surface charge density, $\\sigma_b$, at a planar interface between two uniformly polarized media. We are instructed to start from the definition of the bound charge density, $\\rho_b = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P}$.\n\nTo find the surface charge density, we apply the divergence theorem to the definition of $\\rho_b$. The total bound charge $Q_b$ enclosed within a volume $V$ is given by the integral of the volume charge density $\\rho_b$:\n$$Q_b = \\iiint_V \\rho_b \\, dV = \\iiint_V (-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P}) \\, dV$$\nBy the divergence theorem, this volume integral can be converted into a surface integral over the boundary $S$ of the volume $V$:\n$$Q_b = - \\oiint_S \\mathbf{P} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}$$\nLet us consider the interface between two semi-infinite domains, domain $1$ and domain $2$. The polarization is a uniform vector $\\mathbf{P}_1$ in domain $1$ and $\\mathbf{P}_2$ in domain $2$. The interface is a plane with a unit normal vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ pointing from domain $1$ into domain $2$.\n\nTo find the surface charge density $\\sigma_b$ at this interface, we construct a small Gaussian pillbox that straddles the boundary. The pillbox has two flat faces of area $\\Delta A$ parallel to the interface, one in domain $1$ and the other in domain $2$, and a side wall of height $h$. The total bound charge inside this pillbox is $Q_b$. In the limit as the height $h \\to 0$, any volume charge density contribution vanishes, and the only charge remaining is the surface charge on the area $\\Delta A$ of the interface enclosed by the pillbox. Thus, for an infinitesimally thin pillbox, the enclosed bound charge is $Q_b = \\sigma_b \\Delta A$.\n\nNow we evaluate the surface integral of $\\mathbf{P}$ over the closed surface of the pillbox. The surface consists of the top face (in domain $2$), the bottom face (in domain $1$), and the side wall.\nThe outward-pointing normal to the top face is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$.

In the limit $h \\to 0$, the area of the side wall goes to zero, and thus its contribution to the surface integral vanishes.\n\nSumming the contributions, the total flux of $\\mathbf{P}$ through the closed surface of the pillbox becomes:\n$$\\oiint_S \\mathbf{P} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = (\\mathbf{P}_2 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\Delta A) - (\\mathbf{P}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\Delta A) = (\\mathbf{P}_2 - \\mathbf{P}_1) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\Delta A$$\nEquating the two expressions for the enclosed bound charge $Q_b$:\n$$\\sigma_b \\Delta A = - \\oiint_S \\mathbf{P} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = -(\\mathbf{P}_2 - \\mathbf{P}_1) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\Delta A$$\nDividing by the area $\\Delta A$, we obtain the general expression for the bound surface charge density:\n$$\\sigma_b = -(\\mathbf{P}_2 - \\mathbf{P}_1) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\sigma_b = (\\mathbf{P}_1 - \\mathbf{P}_2) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$$\nThis expression gives the density of the net dipole ends that terminate at the interface.\n\nThe second task is to evaluate this expression for the specific geometry given.

Gauss's law for the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ is given by $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{D}=\\rho_{\\mathrm{free}}$. Since there are no free charges, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{free}}=0$, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{D}=0\n$$\nThe constitutive relation connecting $\\mathbf{D}$, the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, and the polarization $\\mathbf{P}$ is $\\mathbf{D}=\\epsilon_{0}\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{P}$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$\n\\nabla\\cdot(\\epsilon_{0}\\mathbf{E}+\\mathbf{P})=0\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{0}\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} + \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P} = 0\n$$\nThe bound volume charge density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}$ is defined as $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}} = -\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P}$. Using this definition, we can write:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{0}\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}\n$$\nThe electric field is related to the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ by $\\mathbf{E}=-\\nabla\\phi$. Substituting this into the equation yields Poisson's equation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{0}\\nabla\\cdot(-\\nabla\\phi) = \\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla^2\\phi = -\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\epsilon_0}\n$$\nGiven that all fields and potentials vary only with the coordinate $z$, the Laplacian operator simplifies to $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{d^2}{dz^2}$. The polarization is $\\mathbf{P}(z) = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}P(z)$, so the bound volume charge density is:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z) = -\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{P} = -\\frac{d}{dz}P(z)\n$$\nSubstituting these into Poisson's equation gives the one-dimensional differential equation for $\\phi(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi(z)}{dz^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\left(-\\frac{dP(z)}{dz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\frac{dP(z)}{dz}\n$$\nThis equation is valid for $z \\in (0, L)$. The problem provides the boundary conditions $\\phi(0)=0$ and $\\phi(L)=0$. Thus, the complete one-dimensional boundary-value problem for $\\phi(z)$ is:\n- **Differential Equation**: $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dz^2} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\frac{dP}{dz}$ for $0<z<L$.\n- **Boundary Conditions**: $\\phi(0)=0$, $\\phi(L)=0$.\n\n### Part 2: Green's Function and Integral Representation\n\nWe seek to solve a boundary-value problem of the form $\\mathcal{L}\\phi(z) = f(z)$ on an interval $[a,b]$, with specified boundary conditions. Here, the linear operator is $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{d^2}{dz^2}$, the source term is $f(z) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\frac{dP(z)}{dz}$, and the interval is $[0,L]$. The boundary conditions are of the homogeneous Dirichlet type. The solution can be formally written as an integral involving the Green's function $G(z,z')$ corresponding to the operator $\\mathcal{L}$ and the boundary conditions.\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\int_0^L G(z,z') f(z') dz'\n$$\nThe Dirichlet Green's function $G(z,z')$ for the operator $\\frac{d^2}{dz^2}$ on the interval $[0,L]$ is defined by:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial^2 G(z,z')}{\\partial z^2} = \\delta(z-z')$.\n2.  $G(0,z')=0$ and $G(L,z')=0$.\n\nThe solution for this Green's function is well-known and can be constructed systematically. The result is:\n$$\nG(z,z') =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{z(z'-L)}{L} & 0 \\le z \\le z' \\\\\n\\frac{z'(z-L)}{L} & z' \\le z \\le L\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis can be written compactly as $G(z,z') = \\frac{1}{L} z_< (z_> - L)$, where $z_< = \\min(z,z')$ and $z_> = \\max(z,z')$.\n\nUsing this Green's function, the integral representation for the potential $\\phi(z)$ is:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\int_0^L G(z,z') \\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\frac{dP(z')}{dz'}\\right) dz' = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0} \\int_0^L G(z,z') \\frac{dP(z')}{dz'} dz'\n$$\nThis representation expresses $\\phi(z)$ in terms of the Green's function and the volume bound charge density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{b}}(z') = -dP(z')/dz'$.\n\nThe problem asks how the bound surface charges are encoded. The bound surface charges arise from the discontinuity of the polarization at the boundaries of the dielectric. The surface charge density is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\mathbf{P} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ is the outward normal from the dielectric.\n- At $z=0$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, so $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{b}}(0) = \\mathbf{P}(0) \\cdot (-\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = -P(0)$.\n- At $z=L$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = +\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, so $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{b}}(L) = \\mathbf{P}(L) \\cdot (+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = P(L)$.\n\nThese surface charges do not explicitly appear in the integrand of the derived integral representation. Their effect is implicitly included through the use of the Dirichlet Green's function. The BVP as formulated, $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dz^2} = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\frac{dP}{dz}$ with $\\phi(0)=\\phi(L)=0$, is a complete mathematical description of the physical system. The solution to this BVP yields the correct potential $\\phi(z)$ that results from the combined effect of all charges present (volume bound charges, surface bound charges, and charges induced on the conducting plates). The Green's function is constructed specifically to satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions, thereby ensuring that the resulting potential includes the contributions required to ground the plates at $z=0$ and $z=L$. Therefore, the surface charges are encoded not in the source term of the integral, but in the structure of the Green's function itself, which guarantees satisfaction of the physical boundary conditions.\n\n### Part 3: Calculation for $P(z) = P_0\\sinh(\\alpha z)$\n\nWhile the Green's function provides a formal solution, it is often more straightforward to solve the BVP by direct integration, especially in one dimension. The method is equivalent and must yield the same result. Starting from $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{D}=0$, we have $\\frac{dD_z}{dz} = 0$, which implies $D_z(z)$ is a constant, let's call it $D_0$.\n$$\nD_z(z) = \\epsilon_0 E_z(z) + P(z) = D_0\n$$\nSolving for the electric field, $E_z(z) = \\frac{D_0 - P(z)}{\\epsilon_0}$. The potential $\\phi(z)$ is found by integrating the electric field, using the boundary condition $\\phi(0)=0$:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = -\\int_0^z E_z(z') dz' = -\\int_0^z \\frac{D_0 - P(z')}{\\epsilon_0} dz' = -\\frac{D_0 z}{\\epsilon_0} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\int_0^z P(z') dz'\n$$\nThe constant $D_0$ is determined by the second boundary condition, $\\phi(L)=0$:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{D_0 L}{\\epsilon_0} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\int_0^L P(z') dz' \\implies D_0 = \\frac{1}{L}\\int_0^L P(z') dz'\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $D_0$ back into the equation for $\\phi(z)$, we obtain a general solution for the potential:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\left(\\int_0^z P(z') dz' - \\frac{z}{L}\\int_0^L P(z') dz'\\right)\n$$\nNow, we use the specific polarization profile $P(z) = P_0 \\sinh(\\alpha z)$. We compute the necessary integrals:\n$$\n\\int P_0 \\sinh(\\alpha z') dz' = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}\\cosh(\\alpha z') + C\n$$\nThe definite integrals are:\n$$\n\\int_0^z P_0 \\sinh(\\alpha z') dz' = \\left[\\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}\\cosh(\\alpha z')\\right]_0^z = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}(\\cosh(\\alpha z) - \\cosh(0)) = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}(\\cosh(\\alpha z) - 1)\n$$\n$$\n\\int_0^L P_0 \\sinh(\\alpha z') dz' = \\left[\\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}\\cosh(\\alpha z')\\right]_0^L = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}(\\cosh(\\alpha L) - \\cosh(0)) = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}(\\cosh(\\alpha L) - 1)\n$$\nSubstituting these results into the expression for $\\phi(z)$:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\left( \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}(\\cosh(\\alpha z) - 1) - \\frac{z}{L} \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha}(\\cosh(\\alpha L) - 1) \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms, we arrive at the final closed-form expression for the electrostatic potential:\n$$\n\\phi(z) = \\frac{P_0}{\\alpha \\epsilon_0} \\left[ \\cosh(\\alpha z) - 1 - \\frac{z}{L}(\\cosh(\\alpha L) - 1) \\right]\n$$\nThis expression satisfies the differential equation and the boundary conditions $\\phi(0)=0$ and $\\phi(L)=0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{P_{0}}{\\alpha \\epsilon_{0}} \\left[ \\cosh(\\alpha z) - 1 - \\frac{z}{L} \\left( \\cosh(\\alpha L) - 1 \\right) \\right]}\n$$", "id": "3002488"}, {"introduction": "We now transition from the classical picture to the modern quantum theory of polarization, where the change in polarization is rooted in the geometric properties of the electronic wavefunctions.

The total change in polarization over a time interval from $t_i$ to $t_f$ is therefore $\\Delta P = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} J(t) dt$.\n\nThe system's Hamiltonian $H(k, \\lambda(t))$ changes slowly in time through the parameter $\\lambda(t)$.

The parameter space is a cylinder defined by $k \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$ and $\\lambda \\in [0, 4\\pi]$. The boundary of this cylinder consists of two line segments at $k=\\pm\\pi/a$ and two circles at $\\lambda=0$ and $\\lambda=4\\pi$.

The total polarization change will be twice the change over one cycle, e.g., $\\lambda \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nFor such a cyclic evolution, the net pumped charge is a topological invariant, an integer known as the first Chern number, $C_1$. The polarization change is $\\Delta P = e C_1$. This Chern number is the winding number of the map from the parameter space to the space of directions of $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$. The parameter space for one cycle is a torus $T^2$ since $k$ is periodic (a circle $S^1$) and $\\lambda \\in [0, 2\\pi]$ is also a circle (since $H(\\lambda=0)=H(\\lambda=2\\pi)$).\nThe winding number $W$ is given by the formula:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\lambda \\int_{-\\pi/a}^{\\pi/a} dk \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} \\cdot (\\partial_k \\hat{\\mathbf{d}} \\times \\partial_\\lambda \\hat{\\mathbf{d}})\n$$\nWe calculate this integer by finding the preimages of a regular value on the sphere $S^2$ of directions $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}}$, for instance the North Pole, $\\hat{\\mathbf{d}} = (0,0,1)$. The winding number is the sum of the signs of the Jacobian determinant of the map at each preimage.\n\nA preimage of the North Pole requires $d_x=0$, $d_y=0$, and $d_z > 0$.\n$d_y(k,\\lambda) = t(1-r\\cos\\lambda)\\sin(ka) = 0$. Since $t>0$ and $1-r\\cos\\lambda$ is not identically zero, this implies $\\sin(ka)=0$, so $k=0$ or $k=\\pm \\pi/a$.\n\nIf $k=0$: $d_x = t[1+r\\cos\\lambda + 1-r\\cos\\lambda] = 2t \\neq 0$. So $k=0$ is not a solution.\nIf $k=\\pi/a$: $d_x = t[1+r\\cos\\lambda - (1-r\\cos\\lambda)] = 2tr\\cos\\lambda$. For $d_x=0$, since $t,r>0$, we need $\\cos\\lambda=0$.\nThe condition $\\cos\\lambda = 0$ implies $\\lambda = \\pi/2 + n\\pi$ for integer $n$.\nThe condition $d_z > 0$ is $\\Delta_0 \\sin\\lambda > 0$, which means $\\sin\\lambda > 0$.\nCombining $\\cos\\lambda=0$ and $\\sin\\lambda > 0$, we get $\\lambda = \\pi/2 + 2m\\pi$ for integer $m$.\n\nFor one cycle $\\lambda \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, we find one preimage of the North Pole at $(k, \\lambda) = (\\pi/a, \\pi/2)$.\n\nTo find the local degree (sign of the Jacobian), we analyze the map $(k,\\lambda) \\to (\\hat{d}_x, \\hat{d}_y)$ in the vicinity of this point. Let $k=\\pi/a+\\delta k$ and $\\lambda=\\pi/2+\\delta\\lambda$.\nUsing Taylor expansions for small $\\delta k, \\delta\\lambda$:\n$\\cos(ka) = \\cos(\\pi+a\\delta k) \\approx -1$\n$\\sin(ka) = \\sin(\\pi+a\\delta k) \\approx -a\\delta k$\n$\\cos\\lambda \\approx -\\delta\\lambda$\n$\\sin\\lambda \\approx 1$\n\nThe components of $\\mathbf{d}$ are approximately:\n$d_x \\approx t[1-r\\delta\\lambda + (1+r\\delta\\lambda)(-1)] = -2tr\\delta\\lambda$\n$d_y \\approx t(1+r\\delta\\lambda)(-a\\delta k) \\approx -at\\delta k$\n$d_z \\approx \\Delta_0 \\sin(\\pi/2) = \\Delta_0$\nAt this point, $|\\mathbf{d}| \\approx \\Delta_0$. The normalized vector components are $\\hat{d}_x \\approx - (2tr/\\Delta_0)\\delta\\lambda$ and $\\hat{d}_y \\approx -(at/\\Delta_0)\\delta k$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix of the map $(\\delta k, \\delta \\lambda) \\mapsto (\\hat{d}_x, \\hat{d}_y)$ is:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{d}_x}{\\partial(\\delta k)} & \\frac{\\partial \\hat{d}_x}{\\partial(\\delta \\lambda)} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\hat{d}_y}{\\partial(\\delta k)} & \\frac{\\partial \\hat{d}_y}{\\partial(\\delta \\lambda)} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -2tr/\\Delta_0 \\\\ -at/\\Delta_0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(J) = -( -at/\\Delta_0 ) ( -2tr/\\Delta_0 ) = -2at^2r/\\Delta_0^2$.\nSince $a,t,r,\\Delta_0$ are all positive, $\\det(J) < 0$. The sign of the determinant is $-1$.\nThus, the winding number for one cycle ($\\lambda: 0 \\to 2\\pi$) is $W_1 = -1$.\n\nThe full process is for $\\lambda: 0 \\to 4\\pi$. This consists of two identical cycles.\nThe second cycle, $\\lambda \\in [2\\pi, 4\\pi]$, will also have one preimage of the North Pole at $(k, \\lambda) = (\\pi/a, 5\\pi/2)$. The local analysis is identical, yielding another contribution of $-1$ to the winding number.\nThe total winding number over the full process is $W = W_1 + W_2 = (-1) + (-1) = -2$.\n\nThe net change in polarization is $\\Delta P = eW$. Therefore, the requested dimensionless ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta P}{e} = W = -2\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Physical Significance\n\nThe problem specifies zero external electric field ($\\mathbf{E}=0$) and no free charges ($\\rho_{\\text{free}}=0$). The displacement field is defined as $\\mathbf{D} = \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P}$. Under these conditions, $\\mathbf{D} = \\mathbf{P}$. The fundamental Maxwell equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho_{\\text{free}}$ becomes $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P} = 0$. This implies that the bound charge density $\\rho_{\\text{bound}} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P}$ is zero everywhere in the bulk of the insulator.\n\nHowever, the result $\\Delta P/e = -2$ signifies a non-zero, quantized change in the bulk polarization of the material. This corresponds to a net transport of charge. Over the full adiabatic cycle, a charge equal to $-2e$ is pumped across any cross-section of the one-dimensional crystal. This phenomenon is known as a Thouless charge pump. While there is no net accumulation of charge *in* the bulk (as $\\rho_{\\text{bound}}=0$), charge is transported from one end of the sample to the other, leading to a change in the surface charge density at the boundaries. The integer value of $\\Delta P/e$ is a topological invariant, protected by the energy gap of the insulator, and is robust against continuous deformations of the Hamiltonian that do not close the gap. This demonstrates that a current and net charge transport can be induced in an insulator without any applied electric field, purely by the adiabatic manipulation of the system's internal parameters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-2}$$", "id": "3002458"}]}
