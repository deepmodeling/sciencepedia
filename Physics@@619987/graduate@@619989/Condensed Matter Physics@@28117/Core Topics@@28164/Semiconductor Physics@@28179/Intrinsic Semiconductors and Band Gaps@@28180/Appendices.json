The potential energy is the screened Coulomb potential:\n$$ V(r) = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\epsilon r} $$\nwhere $r = |\\mathbf{r}_e - \\mathbf{r}_h|$ is the separation distance, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, and $\\epsilon$ is the static relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor.\n\nThis two-body problem can be separated into two one-body problems by transforming to center-of-mass and relative coordinates. Let the center-of-mass coordinate be $\\mathbf{R} = \\dfrac{m_e^*\\mathbf{r}_e + m_h^*\\mathbf{r}_h}{M}$ and the relative coordinate be $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_e - \\mathbf{r}_h$.

The intrinsic conductivity, $\\sigma_i$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_i(T) = e n_i(T) (\\mu_{n}(T) + \\mu_{p}(T))\n$$\nThe problem states that the semiconductor is in a temperature range where carrier statistics are non-degenerate and the bands are parabolic. The intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i(T)$ is then given by:\n$$\nn_i(T) = \\sqrt{N_C(T) N_V(T)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $E_g$ is the fundamental band gap, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $N_C(T)$ and $N_V(T)$ are the effective densities of states (EDOS) for the conduction and valence bands, respectively. For parabolic bands, the EDOS have the following temperature dependence:\n$$\nN_C(T) = 2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{n}^{*} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\propto T^{3/2}\n$$\n$$\nN_V(T) = 2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{p}^{*} k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\propto T^{3/2}\n$$\nwhere $m_{n}^{*}$ and $m_{p}^{*}$ are the electron and hole effective masses and $h$ is Planck's constant.\n\nConsequently, the pre-exponential factor in the expression for $n_i(T)$ has a temperature dependence of:\n$$\n\\sqrt{N_C(T) N_V(T)} \\propto \\sqrt{T^{3/2} \\cdot T^{3/2}} = T^{3/2}\n$$\nSo, the intrinsic carrier concentration can be written as:\n$$\nn_i(T) = C_n T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C_n$ is a temperature-independent constant incorporating the effective masses and other fundamental constants.\n\nThe problem states that lattice (phonon) scattering dominates transport. The electron and hole mobilities are given to have a temperature dependence of the form:\n$$\n\\mu_n(T) = \\mu_{n0}\\left(\\frac{T}{300\\,\\text{K}}\\right)^{-3/2} \\propto T^{-3/2}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_p(T) = \\mu_{p0}\\left(\\frac{T}{300\\,\\text{K}}\\right)^{-3/2} \\propto T^{-3/2}\n$$\nThis specific power law, $T^{-3/2}$, is characteristic of acoustic phonon scattering in non-polar semiconductors, which is consistent with the problem statement. The sum of the mobilities is:\n$$\n\\mu_n(T) + \\mu_p(T) = (\\mu_{n0} + \\mu_{p0}) \\left(\\frac{T}{300\\,\\text{K}}\\right)^{-3/2} = C_\\mu T^{-3/2}\n$$\nwhere $C_\\mu$ is another temperature-independent constant.\n\nNow, we can substitute these expressions back into the formula for intrinsic conductivity:\n$$\n\\sigma_i(T) = e \\left(C_n T^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2k_B T}\\right)\\right) (C_\\mu T^{-3/2})\n$$\nNotably, the temperature-dependent pre-factors cancel each other out:\n$$\n\\sigma_i(T) = e C_n C_\\mu \\cdot T^{3/2} \\cdot T^{-3/2} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\fracE_g}{2k_B T}\\right) = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_0 = e C_n C_\\mu$ is a constant, independent of temperature. This simplified relationship allows for a direct calculation of the band gap $E_g$ using the two provided conductivity measurements.\n\nLet the two measurements be $\\sigma_i(T_1)$ at temperature $T_1$ and $\\sigma_i(T_2)$ at temperature $T_2$.\n$$\n\\sigma_i(T_1) = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2k_B T_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_i(T_2) = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2k_B T_2}\\right)\n$$\nTaking the ratio of these two equations eliminates the unknown constant $\\sigma_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_i(T_2)}{\\sigma_i(T_1)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2k_B T_2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{2k_B T_1}\\right)} = \\exp\\left[\\frac{E_g}{2k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nTo solve for $E_g$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_i(T_2)}{\\sigma_i(T_1)}\\right) = \\frac{E_g}{2k_B} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\n$$\nIsolating $E_g$ gives:\n$$\nE_g = 2k_B \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_i(T_2)}{\\sigma_i(T_1)}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n- $T_1 = 400\\,\\text{K}$\n- $\\sigma_i(T_1) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n- $T_2 = 600\\,\\text{K}$\n- $\\sigma_i(T_2) = 1.0\\,\\text{S}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n- $k_B = 8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the terms in the expression for $E_g$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_i(T_2)}{\\sigma_i(T_1)} = \\frac{1.0}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = 10000 = 10^4\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_i(T_2)}{\\sigma_i(T_1)}\\right) = \\ln(10^4) = 4 \\ln(10)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{400\\,\\text{K}} - \\frac{1}{600\\,\\text{K}} = \\frac{3 - 2}{1200\\,\\text{K}} = \\frac{1}{1200}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $E_g$:\n$$\nE_g = 2 \\cdot (8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{eV}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\frac{4 \\ln(10)}{\\frac{1}{1200}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nE_g = 2 \\cdot (8.617333 \\times 10^{-5}) \\cdot 1200 \\cdot 4 \\ln(10)\\,\\text{eV}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\nE_g = (1.7234666 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot 1200 \\cdot (9.21034) \\,\\text{eV}\n$$\n$$\nE_g \\approx 0.206816 \\cdot 9.21034 \\,\\text{eV} \\approx 1.90483\\,\\text{eV}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures, which yields $E_g = 1.905\\,\\text{eV}$.\n\nThe problem also asks to reconcile this value with the optical absorption onset at $E_{\\text{on}} = 1.85\\,\\text{eV}$, which is attributed to the $n=1$ bound exciton. An exciton is a quasiparticle consisting of an electron and a hole bound together by their mutual electrostatic Coulomb attraction. In a direct-gap semiconductor, the lowest-energy optical absorption event is typically the creation of an exciton, which requires an energy slightly less than the band gap. The energy of this $n=1$ exciton transition is given by:\n$$\nE_{\\text{on}} = E_g - E_B\n$$\nwhere $E_B$ is the exciton binding energy, representing the energy required to separate the electron-hole pair. Using our calculated value for $E_g$ and the given $E_{\\text{on}}$, we can find the implied binding energy:\n$$\nE_B = E_g - E_{\\text{on}} = 1.905\\,\\text{eV} - 1.85\\,\\text{eV} = 0.055\\,\\text{eV}\n$$\nThis binding energy of $55\\,\\text{meV}$ is a physically reasonable value for a semiconductor with a band gap in this range, providing a consistency check on our result for $E_g$. The reconciliation is thus successful.\n\nThe primary task is to report the fundamental band gap $E_g$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.905}\n$$", "id": "2996692"}]}
