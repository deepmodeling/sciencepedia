In free space, the frequency $f$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ are related by $c = f\\lambda$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. Thus, the photon energy can be expressed as:\n$$E_{\\text{photon}} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\n\nThe process of photoemission is governed by the conservation of energy at the metal-vacuum interface. An incident photon is absorbed by an electron within the metal. To be ejected from the metal into the vacuum, the electron must overcome the binding energy that holds it within the solid. The minimum energy required to liberate an electron from the highest occupied energy level (the Fermi level) to a state of rest in the vacuum just outside the surface is defined as the work function, $\\phi$.\n\nFor an electron to be emitted, the energy it absorbs from the photon, $E_{\\text{photon}}$, must be at least equal to the work function $\\phi$. Any energy in excess of $\\phi$ is converted into the kinetic energy, $E_k$, of the photoelectron after it has escaped the surface. The energy conservation equation for a single photoemission event is therefore:\n$$E_k = E_{\\text{photon}} - \\phi$$\nSince kinetic energy cannot be negative ($E_k \\ge 0$), the condition for photoemission to occur is:\n$$E_{\\text{photon}} - \\phi \\ge 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad E_{\\text{photon}} \\ge \\phi$$\nSubstituting the expression for photon energy in terms of wavelength, we get:\n$$\\frac{hc}{\\lambda} \\ge \\phi$$\nTo find the condition on the wavelength $\\lambda$, we rearrange the inequality:\n$$\\lambda \\le \\frac{hc}{\\phi}$$\nThis inequality shows that photoemission occurs for all photon wavelengths less than or equal to a specific threshold value. This threshold, or maximum, wavelength corresponds to the case where the photon has just enough energy to eject the electron with zero kinetic energy ($E_k = 0$). The problem statement refers to this threshold as the \"minimum free-space photon wavelength $\\lambda_{\\min}$\". While this phrasing is potentially ambiguous (as any wavelength shorter than the threshold also works), it is standard convention in this context to interpret it as the threshold (cutoff) wavelength. We shall denote this threshold wavelength as $\\lambda_t$.\n$$\\lambda_t = \\frac{hc}{\\phi}$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of this threshold wavelength.

It is an intrinsic property determined by the material's work function and is independent of the optical properties of the surface such as reflectivity. Therefore, finite UV reflectivity **does not modify the threshold condition itself**. The wavelength at which photoemission begins, $\\lambda_t = \\frac{hc}{\\phi}$, remains unchanged.\n\nHowever, reflectivity significantly affects the **experimental observation** of the photoemission process. The reflectivity, $R$, is the fraction of incident photons that are reflected and do not interact with the electrons in a way that leads to photoemission. Only the absorbed fraction of photons, given by the absorptivity $A = 1 - R$ (for an opaque material), can contribute to the photocurrent. The measured photoemission quantum yield (emitted electrons per incident photon) is directly proportional to the absorptivity. If a metal has a high reflectivity in the UV spectral range, the number of absorbed photons will be small, resulting in a very low photocurrent even for photons with energy well above the threshold. This reduction in signal strength can make it experimentally more challenging to precisely locate the threshold, as the photocurrent becomes difficult to distinguish from noise near the cutoff wavelength. The reflectivity $R(\\lambda)$ acts as a spectral filter on the incident light, modulating the intensity of the observed photocurrent as a function of wavelength, but it does not shift the fundamental wavelength at which the current first appears.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{275.5}\n$$", "id": "2985250"}, {"introduction": "Shifting our focus from light to heat, this problem explores thermionic emission, a process governed by the Richardson-Dushman law.

The Effective Potential Barrier and Schottky Lowering\n\nAn electron of charge $\\,-e\\,$ at a distance $\\,x>0\\,$ from a planar metal surface at $\\,x=0\\,$ experiences two forces in the one-dimensional model: an attractive force from its own image charge within the conductor and a force from an externally applied electric field, $\\,E_s\\,$, at the surface.

An electron can escape if its kinetic energy associated with motion normal to the surface, $\\,p_x^2/(2m_e)\\,$, is greater than the effective work function $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$. Let's measure energies relative to the Fermi Level, so we require $\\,p_x^2/(2m_e) > \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$.\n\nThe current density $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}}\\,$ is:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\int e v_x dn = \\frac{2e}{h^3} \\int_{p_{x,\\min}}^\\infty dp_x \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dp_y \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dp_z \\left(\\frac{p_x}{m_e}\\right) e^{-( (p_x^2+p_y^2+p_z^2)/(2m_e) ) / (k_B T)}\n$$\nHere, we have set $\\,E_F=0\\,$ for simplicity. The lower limit of integration for $\\,p_x\\,$ is $\\,p_{x,\\min} = \\sqrt{2m_e \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\\,$. The integrals over $\\,p_y\\,$ and $\\,p_z\\,$ are standard Gaussian integrals: $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-ap^2}dp = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}\\,$. Here $\\,a=1/(2m_e k_B T)\\,$, so each integral evaluates to $\\,\\sqrt{2\\pi m_e k_B T}\\,$.\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\frac{2e}{h^3} (2\\pi m_e k_B T) \\int_{\\sqrt{2m_e \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}}}^\\infty \\frac{p_x}{m_e} e^{-p_x^2/(2m_e k_B T)} dp_x\n$$\nTo solve the $\\,p_x\\,$ integral, let $\\,u = p_x^2/(2m_e k_B T)\\,$. Then $\\,du = (p_x / (m_e k_B T)) dp_x\\,$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}^\\infty (k_B T) e^{-u} du = k_B T [-e^{-u}]_{\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}^\\infty = k_B T e^{-\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\frac{2e}{h^3} (2\\pi m_e k_B T) (k_B T e^{-\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}) = \\left(\\frac{4\\pi m_e e k_B^2}{h^3}\\right) T^2 e^{-\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}\n$$\nThis is the Richardson-Dushman equation, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}} = A_R T^2 e^{-\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}/(k_B T)}\\,$, where the Richardson constant $\\,A_R\\,$ is identified as:\n$$\nA_R = \\frac{4\\pi m_e e k_B^2}{h^3} \\approx 1.2017 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-2}}\n$$\nIn this formula, the work function $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,$ must be in Joules.\n\n### 3. Space-Charge-Limited Current Density\n\nWhen emission is strong, the charge of the emitted electrons in the gap between the cathode ($\\,x=0\\,$) and anode ($\\,x=d\\,$) can become significant. This \"space charge\" creates its own electric field that opposes further emission. The maximum current that can be sustained by a potential difference $\\,V\\,$ across the gap is known as the space-charge-limited current, given by the Child-Langmuir law.\n\nWe derive it from the 1D Poisson equation and energy conservation, assuming electrons are emitted with zero initial velocity.\nPoisson's equation: $\\,\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon_0}\\,$.\nEnergy conservation: $\\,\\frac{1}{2}m_e v(x)^2 = e \\phi(x)\\,$, giving $\\,v(x) = \\sqrt{2e\\phi(x)/m_e}\\,$.\nCurrent continuity: $\\,J = |\\rho(x)| v(x)\\,$, so $\\,|\\rho(x)| = J/v(x) = J \\sqrt{m_e/(2e\\phi(x))}\\,$.\nSubstituting into Poisson's equation ($\\rho = -|\\rho|$):\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{J}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e}{2e}} \\phi^{-1/2}\n$$\nWe solve this ODE with boundary conditions $\\,\\phi(0)=0\\,$ and $\\,\\phi(d)=V\\,$. The space-charge-limited condition implies the electric field at the cathode vanishes due to the charge cloud: $\\,E(0) = -(d\\phi/dx)|_{x=0} = 0\\,$. Integrating the ODE once gives $\\,(d\\phi/dx)^2 = 4(J/\\epsilon_0)\\sqrt{m_e/(2e)} \\phi^{1/2}\\,$. A second integration yields $\\,\\frac{4}{3}\\phi^{3/4} = 2\\sqrt{J/\\epsilon_0} (m_e/(2e))^{1/4} x\\,$. Applying the anode boundary condition $\\,\\phi(d)=V\\,$ and solving for the current density $\\,J_{CL}\\,$ gives:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{CL}} = \\frac{4\\epsilon_0}{9} \\sqrt{\\frac{2e}{m_e}} \\frac{V^{3/2}}{d^2}\n$$\nUsing the relation $\\,V = E_{\\mathrm{ext}}d\\,$, we can express $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$ in terms of the external field:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{CL}}(E_{\\mathrm{ext}}, d) = \\frac{4\\epsilon_0}{9} \\sqrt{\\frac{2e}{m_e}} E_{\\mathrm{ext}}^{3/2} d^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $\\,E_{\\mathrm{ext}} > 0\\,$ (and hence $\\,V>0\\,$). If $\\,E_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\le 0\\,$, no current can be drawn, so $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}=0\\,$.\n\n### 4. Self-Consistent Model\n\nThe final step is to combine these effects. The current that the cathode *can* emit, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}}\\,$, depends on the surface field $\\,E_s\\,$ through the Schottky effect. The current the gap *can* sustain, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$, depends on the external field $\\,E_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\,$ and gap distance $\\,d\\,$. The core of the model is enforcing consistency.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Assume the flow is *supply-limited*. This means space charge is negligible and the field at the surface is simply the externally applied field, $\\,E_s = E_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\,$.\n2.  Calculate a provisional effective work function $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff, prov}}\\,$ using this surface field $\\,E_s=E_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\,$ in the Schottky formula.\n3.  Calculate the corresponding thermionic emission current, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}}(T, \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff, prov}})\\,$.\n4.  Calculate the maximum sustainable current density, $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}(V, d)\\,$, where $\\,V=E_{\\mathrm{ext}}d\\,$.\n5.  Compare $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}}\\,$ and $\\,J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$:\n    -   If $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}} \\le J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$: The assumption was correct. The cathode is the bottleneck, and the effective barrier is indeed lowered by the external field. The final effective work function is $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff, prov}}\\,$.\n    -   If $\\,J_{\\mathrm{em}} > J_{\\mathrm{CL}}\\,$: The assumption was incorrect. The cathode *tries* to emit more current than the gap can transport. Space charge builds up and suppresses the field at the cathode. In this *space-charge-limited* regime, the model approximates the surface field as being completely quenched, $\\,E_s = 0\\,$. With zero surface field, there is no Schottky lowering, so the effective barrier is simply the bare work function, $\\,\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Phi_0\\,$.\n\nThis logic provides a deterministic way to find the self-consistent effective emission barrier for each set of parameters. All energies are treated in Joules for calculations and converted to electronvolts for the final output. The final value is clamped at or above zero.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the effective emission barrier for electrons from a metallic surface\n    by self-consistently solving for thermionic emission and space-charge limits.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical Constants (CODATA 2018)\n    e = 1.602176634e-19  # Elementary charge [C]\n    eps0 = 8.8541878128e-12 # Vacuum permittivity [F/m]\n    me = 9.1093837015e-31  # Electron mass [kg]\n    kB = 1.380649e-23      # Boltzmann constant [J/K]\n    h = 6.62607015e-34    # Planck constant [J s]\n\n    # Derived constants for the model\n    # Richardson constant A_R = (4 * pi * me * e * kB^2) / h^3\n    AR = (4 * np.pi * me * e * kB**2) / h**3\n\n    # Schottky effect pre-factor (in Joules per (V/m)^0.5)\n    # Delta_Phi_J = k_S * sqrt(E_s)\n    k_S = np.sqrt(e**3 / (4 * np.pi * eps0))\n\n    # Child-Langmuir law pre-factor (in A * m^2 / V^1.5)\n    # J_CL = k_CL * V^1.5 / d^2\n    k_CL = (4 * eps0 / 9) * np.sqrt(2 * e / me)\n\n    # Test suite: (Phi_0 [eV], T [K], E_ext [V/m], d [m])\n    test_cases = [\n        (4.50, 2200, 2.0e6, 1.0e-5),   # Case 1\n        (4.50, 2900, 2.0e6, 1.0e-3),   # Case 2\n        (4.50, 3300, 2.0e6, 1.0e-3),   # Case 3\n        (4.50, 2500, 0.0, 1.0e-4),    # Case 4\n        (4.50, 2000, 5.0e7, 1.0e-5),   # Case 5\n    ]\n    \n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        Phi0_eV, T, E_ext, d = case\n        Phi0_J = Phi0_eV * e\n\n        # Step 1: Provisional calculation assuming supply-limited regime (E_s = E_ext)\n        E_s = E_ext\n        \n        # Calculate Schottky barrier lowering\n        # Delta_Phi is 0 if E_s is not a positive, accelerating field\n        if E_s > 0:\n            delta_Phi_J = k_S * np.sqrt(E_s)\n        else:\n            delta_Phi_J = 0.0\n        \n        Phi_eff_prov_J = Phi0_J - delta_Phi_J\n\n        # Calculate thermionic emission current density for the provisional barrier\n        # Ensure the argument to exp is not excessively large\n        if Phi_eff_prov_J / (kB * T) > 700: # Avoid overflow for np.exp\n            J_em = 0.0\n        else:\n            J_em = AR * T**2 * np.exp(-Phi_eff_prov_J / (kB * T))\n            \n        # Step 2: Calculate space-charge-limited current density\n        V = E_ext * d\n        \n        # Child-Langmuir law is valid for V > 0.
