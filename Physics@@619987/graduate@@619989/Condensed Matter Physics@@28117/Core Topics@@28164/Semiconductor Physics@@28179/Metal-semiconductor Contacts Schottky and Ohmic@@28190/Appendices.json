The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded, providing all necessary parameters and a clear framework for the analysis.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the behavior of an ideal metal-semiconductor junction is the Schottky–Mott rule, which assumes the alignment of the vacuum energy levels ($E_{vac}$) of the isolated metal and semiconductor upon contact. The nature of the contact (rectifying or ohmic) is determined by the barrier that majority carriers face at the interface. As stated in the problem, a positive barrier height for majority carriers results in rectifying behavior, while a nonpositive barrier results in ohmic behavior.\n\nThe barrier height is defined as the energy difference between the metal's Fermi level ($E_{F, M}$) and the relevant band edge of the semiconductor (conduction band for electrons, valence band for holes) at the metallurgical junction.\n\nLet the metal work function be $\\phi_{M}$, and the semiconductor electron affinity and band gap be $\\chi$ and $E_g$, respectively. After contact, the Fermi levels align, and the semiconductor band edges at the interface are positioned relative to the metal's Fermi level. The conduction band minimum at the interface, $E_{C,i}$, is at an energy $\\chi$ below the vacuum level, while the metal's Fermi level is $\\phi_M$ below the vacuum level.\n\n**Case 1: n-type Semiconductor**\n\nFor an $n$-type semiconductor, the majority carriers are electrons. The barrier that these carriers encounter is the Schottky barrier height for electrons, $\\phi_{Bn}$. This barrier is the energy required for an electron to move from the metal's Fermi level to the semiconductor's conduction band at the interface.\n\nThe definition of $\\phi_{Bn}$ is derived from the alignment of the vacuum levels:\n$$ \\phi_{Bn} = E_{C,i} - E_{F, M} $$\nSubstituting the positions relative to the vacuum level, $E_{C,i} = E_{vac} - \\chi$ and $E_{F, M} = E_{vac} - \\phi_M$, we get:\n$$ \\phi_{Bn} = (E_{vac} - \\chi) - (E_{vac} - \\phi_M) = \\phi_M - \\chi $$\nThis is the majority-carrier barrier height for the $n$-type case.\n\nUsing the provided values:\n- Metal work function: $\\phi_{M} = 3.90\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- Silicon electron affinity: $\\chi = 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nWe calculate the barrier height:\n$$ \\phi_{Bn} = 3.90\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 4.05\\,\\mathrm{eV} = -0.15\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe resulting barrier height is negative.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the electron barrier height at a metal-semiconductor interface in the presence of interface states, followed by numerical calculations for specific materials.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Pinned Barrier Height**\n\nWe begin from first principles. At a metal-semiconductor junction in thermal equilibrium, the Fermi levels of the metal, $E_{F,M}$, and the semiconductor, $E_{F,S}$, must align. We can set this common Fermi level to a reference energy, $E_F = E_{F,M} = E_{F,S}$.\n\nThe electron barrier height, $\\phi_B$ (or $\\phi_{Bn}$ for clarity), is defined as the energy difference between the semiconductor's conduction band minimum at the interface, $E_{c,\\text{int}}$, and the metal's Fermi level:\n$$ \\phi_B = E_{c,\\text{int}} - E_F $$\n\nIn the ideal Schottky-Mott model, interface states are neglected. The alignment of Fermi levels is achieved solely by band bending within the semiconductor. It is assumed that the vacuum level is continuous across the interface. The energy from the vacuum level to the metal's Fermi level is the metal work function, $\\phi_M$. The energy from the vacuum level to the semiconductor's conduction band minimum is the electron affinity, $\\chi$. Therefore, the ideal barrier height, $\\phi_B^{\\text{SM}}$, is given by:\n$$ \\phi_B^{\\text{SM}} = \\phi_M - \\chi $$\n\nIn a real junction, a thin layer of interface states exists at the boundary. When the metal and semiconductor are brought into contact, charge can transfer between the metal and these interface states. This creates a net charge, $Q_{it}$, in the interface states, which in turn establishes an electric dipole layer at the interface. This dipole layer introduces a potential drop, $\\Delta V$, across the interface. The potential drop $\\Delta V$ modifies the relationship between the energy levels. The actual barrier height is given by:\n$$ \\phi_B = (\\phi_M - \\chi) - e\\Delta V $$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge. We can absorb the charge $e$ into the potential to work with energies, so let $\\Delta = e\\Delta V$ be the energy drop across the dipole.\n$$ \\phi_B = (\\phi_M - \\chi) - \\Delta $$\n\nThe interface states are characterized by a charge neutrality level (CNL), denoted $E_{\\text{CNL}}$. If the Fermi level at the interface, $E_F$, coincides with $E_{\\text{CNL}}$, the net charge in the interface states is zero ($Q_{it} = 0$). If $E_F \\neq E_{\\text{CNL}}$, a net charge develops. In a linear approximation, the interface charge $Q_{it}$ is proportional to the density of interface states, $D_{it}$, and the energy difference between the Fermi level and the CNL:\n$$ Q_{it} \\approx -D_{it} (E_F - E_{\\text{CNL}}) $$\nThe dipole potential energy $\\Delta$ is proportional to this charge, $\\Delta \\propto Q_{it}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$ \\Delta = -\\gamma (E_F - E_{\\text{CNL}}) $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is a dimensionless parameter that depends on $D_{it}$ and the effective thickness and permittivity of the interface layer.\n\nLet us express $E_{\\text{CNL}}$ in terms of the barrier height. The problem defines the hole barrier height at the CNL, $\\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}}$, which is the energy difference between the CNL and the valence band maximum at the interface, $E_{v,\\text{int}}$:\n$$ \\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}} = E_{\\text{CNL}} - E_{v,\\text{int}} $$\nWe also know that the band gap is $E_g = E_{c,\\text{int}} - E_{v,\\text{int}}$. The electron barrier height is $\\phi_B = E_{c,\\text{int}} - E_F$.\nWe can express $E_{\\text{CNL}}$ relative to the Fermi level $E_F$:\n$$ E_{\\text{CNL}} = E_{v,\\text{int}} + \\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}} = (E_{c,\\text{int}} - E_g) + \\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}} = (E_F + \\phi_B - E_g) + \\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}} $$\nRearranging this gives the energy difference $E_F - E_{\\text{CNL}}$:\n$$ E_F - E_{\\text{CNL}} = -(\\phi_B - E_g + \\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}}) = -(\\phi_B - (E_g - \\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}})) $$\nAs noted in the problem, the term $\\phi_{B,0} = E_g - \\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}}$ is the electron barrier height that would form if the Fermi level were pinned exactly at the CNL.\n\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for the dipole energy $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = -\\gamma \\left[ -(\\phi_B - \\phi_{B,0}) \\right] = \\gamma (\\phi_B - \\phi_{B,0}) $$\nFinally, substitute this expression for $\\Delta$ into the equation for the barrier height $\\phi_B$:\n$$ \\phi_B = (\\phi_M - \\chi) - \\gamma (\\phi_B - \\phi_{B,0}) $$\nWe can now solve for $\\phi_B$:\n$$ \\phi_B + \\gamma \\phi_B = (\\phi_M - \\chi) + \\gamma \\phi_{B,0} $$\n$$ \\phi_B (1 + \\gamma) = (\\phi_M - \\chi) + \\gamma \\phi_{B,0} $$\n$$ \\phi_B = \\frac{1}{1+\\gamma}(\\phi_M - \\chi) + \\frac{\\gamma}{1+\\gamma} \\phi_{B,0} $$\nThe problem defines the pinning factor $S$ as the parameter that quantifies the sensitivity of $\\phi_B$ to changes in $\\phi_M$. From our derived expression, the slope $\\frac{d\\phi_B}{d\\phi_M}$ is $\\frac{1}{1+\\gamma}$. Thus, we identify:\n$$ S = \\frac{1}{1+\\gamma} $$\nConsequently, $1-S = 1 - \\frac{1}{1+\\gamma} = \\frac{\\gamma}{1+\\gamma}$.\n\nSubstituting $S$ and $1-S$ into the equation for $\\phi_B$, and restoring the definition of $\\phi_{B,0}$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$ \\phi_B = S(\\phi_M - \\chi) + (1-S)(E_g - \\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}}) $$\nThis is the desired result, expressing the barrier height in terms of the specified parameters. When $S=1$ (no pinning, $\\gamma=0$), we recover the Schottky-Mott limit: $\\phi_B = \\phi_M - \\chi$. When $S=0$ (strong pinning, $\\gamma \\to \\infty$), the barrier height is fixed at the CNL value: $\\phi_B = E_g - \\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}}$, independent of the metal work function.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculations**\n\nWe are given the following parameters for an $n$-type silicon surface:\n- Electron affinity: $\\chi = 4.05\\,\\text{eV}$\n- Band gap: $E_g = 1.12\\,\\text{eV}$\n- Hole barrier at CNL: $\\phi_{Bp}^{\\text{CNL}} = 0.55\\,\\text{eV}$\n- Pinning factor: $S = 0.10$\n\nWe also have the work functions for three metals:\n- Aluminum: $\\phi_M^{\\text{Al}} = 4.28\\,\\text{eV}$\n- Nickel: $\\phi_M^{\\text{Ni}} = 5.15\\,\\text{eV}$\n- Gold: $\\phi_M^{\\text{Au}} = 5.10\\,\\text{eV}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the constant terms in our formula.
