In a $p$-$n$ junction at thermal equilibrium, there is no net flow of charge, which implies that the electrochemical potential, or Fermi level ($E_F$), must be constant and uniform throughout the entire device.\n\nThe carrier concentrations for holes ($p$) and electrons ($n$) under the assumption of non-degenerate statistics are given by:\n$$p = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$n = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier concentration, $E_i$ is the intrinsic Fermi level, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nWe apply these relations to the neutral regions on the $p$-side and the $n$-side of the junction, far from the depletion region.\nOn the neutral $p$-side, with complete ionization, the majority carrier (hole) concentration $p_p$ is approximately equal to the acceptor concentration $N_a$.

However, the energy bands ($E_c$, $E_v$, $E_i$) bend across the junction due to the presence of a space-charge region and the associated electric field. The total energy band bending for a particle of charge $q$ across the junction is $qV_{bi}$. For an electron with charge $-e$, this energy difference is $-eV_{bi}$. The intrinsic Fermi level $E_i$ follows the electrostatic potential profile $\\phi(x)$, such that the difference in $E_i$ between the neutral $p$-side and the neutral $n$-side is:\n$$E_{i,p} - E_{i,n} = -e\\phi_p - (-e\\phi_n) = e(\\phi_n - \\phi_p) = e V_{bi}$$\nwhere $V_{bi} = \\phi_n - \\phi_p$ is the built-in potential.\n\nTo find an expression for $e V_{bi}$, we sum the two energy difference equations derived earlier:\n$$(E_{i,p} - E_F) + (E_F - E_{i,n}) = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_a}{n_i}\\right) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_d}{n_i}\\right)$$\nThe Fermi level $E_F$ cancels out:\n$$E_{i,p} - E_{i,n} = k_B T \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_a}{n_i}\\right) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_d}{n_i}\\right)\\right]$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a) + \\ln(b) = \\ln(ab)$:\n$$E_{i,p} - E_{i,n} = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $E_{i,p} - E_{i,n} = e V_{bi}$, we get:\n$$e V_{bi} = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nThis yields the desired expression for the built-in potential:\n$$V_{bi} = \\frac{k_B T}{e} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2}\\right)$$\nThe term $\\frac{k_B T}{e}$ is known as the thermal voltage, $V_T$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters:\nAcceptor density $N_{a}=10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\nDonor density $N_{d}=10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\nIntrinsic carrier concentration $n_{i}=1.0\\times 10^{10}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\nTemperature $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\nBoltzmann constant $k_{B}=1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\nElementary charge $e=1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal voltage $V_T$:\n$$V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{e} = \\frac{(1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.0258520\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nNext, we calculate the argument of the natural logarithm:\n$$\\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2} = \\frac{(10^{18}) \\times (10^{16})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{10})^2} = \\frac{10^{34}}{10^{20}} = 10^{14}$$\nFinally, we compute $V_{bi}$:\n$$V_{bi} = V_T \\ln(10^{14}) = (0.0258520\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times 14 \\ln(10)$$\nUsing $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$V_{bi} \\approx (0.0258520\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times 14 \\times 2.302585 \\approx 0.833357\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the built-in potential is $0.8334\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nRegarding the influence of doping asymmetry, the derived expression $V_{bi} = \\frac{k_B T}{e} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_a N_d}{n_i^2}\\right)$ shows that the built-in potential depends on the product of the doping concentrations, $N_a N_d$, and not on their individual values or their ratio.

Doping asymmetry does, however, strongly affect other junction properties, such as the relative widths of the depletion region on the $p$-side versus the $n$-side, but it does not influence $V_{bi}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.8334}\n$$", "id": "2972143"}, {"introduction": "Applying a forward bias disturbs the equilibrium, injecting minority carriers across the junction and driving a current through diffusion.

Using the provided reference values at $T_{ref} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$N_c(T) = N_c(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{T}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)^{3/2}$$\n$$N_v(T) = N_v(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{T}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nwhere $N_c(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 2.8 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ and $N_v(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1.04 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n\n**c. Carrier Mobilities, $\\mu_n(T)$ and $\\mu_p(T)$**\nAt the temperatures of interest, carrier mobility in silicon is limited primarily by phonon scattering. This leads to a power-law dependence on temperature. Using the reference values and exponents provided:\n$$\\mu_n(T) = \\mu_n(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{T}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)^{-m_n}$$\n$$\\mu_p(T) = \\mu_p(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\left(\\frac{T}{300\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)^{-m_p}$$\nwith $\\mu_n(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 0.135\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})$, $\\mu_p(300\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 0.048\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/(\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})$, $m_n = 2.42$, and $m_p = 2.20$.\n\n**2. Derived Physical Quantities**\n\n**a. Intrinsic Carrier Concentration, $n_i(T)$**\nThe law of mass action for an intrinsic semiconductor relates $n_i$ to the bandgap and effective densities of states:\n$$n_i(T) = \\sqrt{N_c(T) N_v(T)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g(T)}{2 k_B T}\\right)$$\nIn this expression, $E_g(T)$ is in $\\mathrm{eV}$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ must be in units of $\\mathrm{eV/K}$ ($8.617... \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$) to ensure the argument of the exponential is dimensionless.\n\n**b. Diffusion Coefficients, $D_n(T)$ and $D_p(T)$**\nThe diffusion coefficients are related to the mobilities through the Einstein relation:\n$$D_{n,p}(T) = \\mu_{n,p}(T) \\frac{k_B T}{q}$$\nThe term $V_T = k_B T / q$ is the thermal voltage. To obtain $D$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $k_B$ must be in $\\mathrm{J/K}$ ($1.380... \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$) and $q$ is the elementary charge in Coulombs.\n\n**c. Diffusion Lengths, $L_n(T)$ and $L_p(T)$**\nThe minority carrier diffusion length is the average distance a carrier diffuses before recombining. For a temperature-independent minority carrier lifetime $\\tau$, it is given by:\n$$L_{n,p}(T) = \\sqrt{D_{n,p}(T) \\tau_{n,p}}$$\nThe problem specifies constant lifetimes $\\tau_n$ and $\\tau_p$.\n\n**3. Diode Current Formulation**\n\n**a. Saturation Current, $I_s(T)$**\nThe total current in a $p$-$n$ junction is the sum of the electron diffusion current at the edge of the p-side neutral region and the hole diffusion current at the edge of the n-side neutral region. Under low-level injection and assuming long quasi-neutral regions (i.e., regions much longer than the diffusion lengths), the solution to the minority carrier diffusion equations yields the standard Shockley diode equation. The saturation current, $I_s$, is the prefactor in this equation. It represents the diffusion current driven by the gradient of equilibrium minority carriers.\nThe excess minority carrier concentrations at the edges of the depletion region, $\\Delta n_p$ and $\\Delta p_n$, are given by the law of the junction:\n$$\\Delta n_p = n_{p0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta p_n = p_{n0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right) = \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nThe corresponding diffusion current densities are $J_n = q \\frac{D_n}{L_n} \\Delta n_p$ and $J_p = q \\frac{D_p}{L_p} \\Delta p_n$. The total current is $I = A(J_n+J_p)$, where $A$ is the junction area.\n$$I = A q n_i^2 \\left( \\frac{D_n}{L_n N_A} + \\frac{D_p}{L_p N_D} \\right) \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{qV}{k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nFrom this, the saturation current $I_s(T)$ is identified as:\n$$I_s(T) = A q \\, n_i(T)^2 \\left( \\frac{D_n(T)}{L_n(T) N_A} + \\frac{D_p(T)}{L_p(T) N_D} \\right)$$\nSubstituting $L = \\sqrt{D \\tau}$, this simplifies to:\n$$I_s(T) = A q \\, n_i(T)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{N_A} \\sqrt{\\frac{D_n(T)}{\\tau_n}} + \\frac{1}{N_D} \\sqrt{\\frac{D_p(T)}{\\tau_p}} \\right)$$\nFor all calculations, doping concentrations $N_A$ and $N_D$, given in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, must be converted to $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ by multiplying by $10^6$.\n\n**b. Forward Current, $I(V_f, T)$**\nThe forward current under an applied bias $V_f$ is given by the Shockley equation, incorporating the ideality factor $n$, which accounts for recombination in the depletion region and other non-ideal effects.\n$$I(V_f, T) = I_s(T) \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{q V_f}{n k_B T}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nHere, $V_f$ is the applied forward voltage. The term $n k_B T$ in the denominator must have units of Joules, requiring $k_B$ in $\\mathrm{J/K}$.\n\n**4. Computational Procedure**\n\nThe implementation will follow these steps for each test case:\n1.  Identify the set of temperatures, diode geometric and doping parameters, carrier lifetimes, ideality factor, and forward bias voltage.\n2.  For each case, determine the minimum ($T_{min}$) and maximum ($T_{max}$) temperatures from the provided list.\n3.  For $T = T_{min}$ and again for $T = T_{max}$:\n    a.  Calculate $E_g(T)$.\n    b.  Calculate $N_c(T)$ and $N_v(T)$.\n    c.  Calculate $\\mu_n(T)$ and $\\mu_p(T)$.\n    d.  Calculate $n_i(T)$.\n    e.  Calculate $D_n(T)$ and $D_p(T)$.\n    f.  Convert $N_A$ and $N_D$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n    g.  Calculate $I_s(T)$ using the derived formula.\n    h.  Calculate $I(V_f, T)$ using the Shockley equation.\n4.  Collect the four resulting values for each test case: $I_s(T_{min})$, $I_s(T_{max})$, $I(V_f, T_{min})$, and $I(V_f, T_{max})$. For single-temperature cases, $T_{min}=T_{max}$ and the values are simply computed at that temperature.\n5.
