It presents a standard, solvable problem in semiconductor physics without any internal contradictions, missing information, or factual errors.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the equilibrium electron and hole concentrations, denoted as $n_0$ and $p_0$ respectively, in a compensated semiconductor. The derivation must start from fundamental principles and result in a single, closed-form expression for the pair $(n_0, p_0)$ that is valid irrespective of whether the material is n-type ($N_D > N_A$) or p-type ($N_A > N_D$).\n\nStep 1: The Charge Neutrality Condition\n\nThe first given starting point is the definition of space charge density, $\\rho$. In a semiconductor with donor and acceptor impurities, $\\rho$ is the sum of the charge contributions from mobile electrons (concentration $n$, charge $-e$), mobile holes (concentration $p$, charge $+e$), ionized donors (concentration $N_D^+$, charge $+e$), and ionized acceptors (concentration $N_A^-$, charge $-e$). The elementary charge is $e$.\n$$ \\rho = e(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-) $$\nThe problem states that the donors and acceptors are shallow and fully ionized at the operating temperature $T$. This implies that every donor atom has donated an electron, and every acceptor atom has accepted an electron. Therefore, the concentrations of ionized donors and acceptors are equal to their respective total concentrations:\n$$ N_D^+ = N_D $$\n$$ N_A^- = N_A $$\nThe space charge density is then:\n$$ \\rho = e(p - n + N_D - N_A) $$\nThe problem specifies that we are considering a point deep inside a quasi-neutral region at equilibrium. In such a region, the net space charge density is zero ($\\rho=0$). Denoting the equilibrium carrier concentrations as $n_0$ and $p_0$, the charge neutrality condition is:\n$$ e(p_0 - n_0 + N_D - N_A) = 0 $$\n$$ p_0 - n_0 + N_D - N_A = 0 $$\nThis can be rearranged to express the difference between the electron and hole concentrations in terms of the net doping concentration:\n$$ n_0 - p_0 = N_D - N_A $$\nThis equation represents the charge neutrality condition that holds in the quasi-neutral region.\n\nStep 2: Derivation of Carrier Concentrations\n\nThe second principle to be used is the relation between carrier densities implied by Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics for a nondegenerate semiconductor at thermal equilibrium. This relationship is the law of mass action, which states that the product of the electron and hole concentrations is constant for a given temperature and material, and is equal to the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$.\n$$ n_0 p_0 = n_i^2 $$\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $n_0$ and $p_0$:\n1. $n_0 - p_0 = N_D - N_A$\n2. $n_0 p_0 = n_i^2$\n\nWe can solve this system. From equation (2), we can express $p_0$ as $p_0 = \\frac{n_i^2}{n_0}$. Substituting this expression into equation (1):\n$$ n_0 - \\frac{n_i^2}{n_0} = N_D - N_A $$\nMultiplying all terms by $n_0$ (which is non-zero) to clear the denominator, we obtain a quadratic equation for $n_0$:\n$$ n_0^2 - (N_D - N_A)n_0 - n_i^2 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x = n_0$, $a = 1$, $b = -(N_D - N_A)$, and $c = -n_i^2$. The solution for $n_0$ is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ n_0 = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\n$$ n_0 = \\frac{(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(N_D - N_A))^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ n_0 = \\frac{N_D - N_A \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nSince carrier concentration must be a positive physical quantity ($n_0 > 0$), we must choose the appropriate sign. The term under the square root, $\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$, is strictly greater than $|\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2}| = |N_D - N_A|$. If we choose the minus sign, the numerator $(N_D - N_A) - \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$ would be negative, leading to an unphysical negative concentration. Therefore, we must select the plus sign.\nThe exact expression for the equilibrium electron concentration is:\n$$ n_0 = \\frac{N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nThis expression is general and holds for both n-type ($N_D > N_A$) and p-type ($N_A > N_D$) compensated semiconductors.\n\nTo find the expression for the hole concentration $p_0$, we can follow a similar procedure. We express $n_0$ from equation (1) as $n_0 = p_0 + (N_D - N_A)$ and substitute it into equation (2):\n$$ (p_0 + N_D - N_A)p_0 = n_i^2 $$\n$$ p_0^2 + (N_D - N_A)p_0 - n_i^2 = 0 $$\nSolving for $p_0$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2} $$\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nAgain, $p_0$ must be positive. The numerator with the minus sign would be negative, which is unphysical. Thus, we must choose the plus sign:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nThis can be rewritten by distributing the negative sign in the first term:\n$$ p_0 = \\frac{N_A - N_D + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2} $$\nSince $(N_D - N_A)^2 = (N_A - N_D)^2$, the expression remains valid and general.\n\nAs a check, we can verify that $n_0 p_0 = n_i^2$. Let $\\Delta N = N_D - N_A$.\n$n_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\Delta N + \\sqrt{(\\Delta N)^2 + 4n_i^2})$\n$p_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(-\\Delta N + \\sqrt{(\\Delta N)^2 + 4n_i^2})$\n$n_0 p_0 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( (\\sqrt{(\\Delta N)^2 + 4n_i^2})^2 - (\\Delta N)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( ((\\Delta N)^2 + 4n_i^2) - (\\Delta N)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{4}(4n_i^2) = n_i^2$.\nThe expressions are consistent.\n\nDiscussion of Limiting Cases:\nFor an n-type compensated semiconductor with net doping $N_D - N_A \\gg n_i$:\n$\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2} \\approx \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2} = N_D - N_A$.\n$n_0 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(N_D - N_A + N_D - N_A) = N_D - N_A$.\n$p_0 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(-(N_D - N_A) + N_D - N_A) = 0$. More accurately, $p_0 = n_i^2/n_0 \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_D - N_A}$.\nFor a p-type compensated semiconductor with net doping $N_A - N_D \\gg n_i$:\n$\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2} = \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2} \\approx N_A - N_D$.\n$p_0 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(N_A - N_D + N_A - N_D) = N_A - N_D$.\n$n_0 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}(-(N_A - N_D) + N_A - N_D) = 0$. More accurately, $n_0 = n_i^2/p_0 \\approx \\frac{n_i^2}{N_A - N_D}$.\nThe general formulae correctly reduce to the expected approximations in the extrinsic limits.\n\nThe required final answer is the ordered pair $(n_0, p_0)$ presented as a single closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\left( N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2} \\right) & \\frac{1}{2} \\left( N_A - N_D + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2} \\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3008680"}, {"introduction": "When n-type and p-type semiconductors are joined, the system seeks a single, uniform Fermi level at equilibrium, a process that is fundamental to all junction devices.

The derivation will proceed from the statistical mechanics of charge carriers in non-degenerate semiconductors and the principles of electrostatic equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between carrier concentrations and the Fermi energy level. For a non-degenerate semiconductor at temperature $T$, the electron concentration $n$ and hole concentration $p$ are given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximations:\n$$n = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_F - E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$p = n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy level, $E_i$ is the intrinsic Fermi level, $n_i$ is the intrinsic carrier density, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The product of these concentrations is $np = n_i^2$, which is the law of mass action.\n\nThe problem first asks to quantify the offsets of the Fermi level relative to the intrinsic level on each side *before* contact.\n\n(i) Fermi Level Offsets Before Contact\n\nFor the isolated n-type semiconductor, it is doped with donor atoms of density $N_D$. Assuming full ionization of donors and that the doping level is significantly higher than the intrinsic carrier density ($N_D \\gg n_i$), the electron concentration is approximately equal to the donor density, $n \\approx N_D$. Let the Fermi level and intrinsic level on the n-side be $E_{F,n}$ and $E_{i,n}$, respectively. Substituting $n = N_D$ into the electron concentration equation:\n$$N_D \\approx n_i \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{F,n} - E_{i,n}}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nSolving for the energy offset $(E_{F,n} - E_{i,n})$ gives:\n$$E_{F,n} - E_{i,n} = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_D}{n_i}\\right)$$\nThis shows that the Fermi level in the n-type material is located above the intrinsic level.\n\nFor the isolated p-type semiconductor, it is doped with acceptor atoms of density $N_A$. Assuming full ionization and $N_A \\gg n_i$, the hole concentration is approximately equal to the acceptor density, $p \\approx N_A$.

A necessary condition for this is that the Fermi level, $E_F$, must be constant and uniform throughout the entire device. Before contact, $E_{F,n}$ is at a higher energy than $E_{F,p}$. To achieve a constant $E_F$, electrons diffuse from the higher-concentration n-side to the lower-concentration p-side, and holes diffuse in the opposite direction.\n\nThis net flow of charge leaves behind uncompensated ionized donors ($N_D^+$) on the n-side and ionized acceptors ($N_A^-$) on the p-side in a region near the interface. This region, depleted of mobile carriers, is called the depletion or space-charge region. The separated positive and negative charges form an electric dipole, creating an internal electric field that points from the n-side to the p-side. This field opposes further diffusion of carriers. Equilibrium is reached when the drift current caused by this electric field exactly balances the diffusion current.\n\nThis electric field corresponds to a change in electrostatic potential, $\\phi(x)$, across the junction. The total potential drop across the junction is the built-in potential, $V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$. The electrostatic potential energy of an electron (charge $-e$) is $-e\\phi(x)$. This potential energy adds to the energy of the electronic bands. If we define the potential to be zero deep in the p-type bulk, $\\phi_p = 0$, then the potential deep in the n-type bulk will be $\\phi_n = V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$.\n\nConsequently, the energy bands on the n-side are lowered by an amount $e V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$ relative to the p-side. The relationship between the intrinsic energy levels in the bulk n-type and p-type regions is:\n$$E_{i,n} = E_{i,p} - e V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$$\nAt equilibrium, the single Fermi level $E_F$ can be expressed relative to the local intrinsic level in both the n-type and p-type bulk regions.\n\nIn the p-type bulk:\n$$E_F = E_{i,p} - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right)$$\nIn the n-type bulk:\n$$E_F = E_{i,n} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_D}{n_i}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the relation $E_{i,n} = E_{i,p} - e V_{\\mathrm{bi}}$ into the second equation:\n$$E_F = \\left(E_{i,p} - e V_{\\mathrm{bi}}\\right) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_D}{n_i}\\right)$$\nSince $E_F$ is constant, we can equate the two expressions for it:\n$$E_{i,p} - k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right) = E_{i,p} - e V_{\\mathrm{bi}} + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_D}{n_i}\\right)$$\nThe term $E_{i,p}$ cancels from both sides.
