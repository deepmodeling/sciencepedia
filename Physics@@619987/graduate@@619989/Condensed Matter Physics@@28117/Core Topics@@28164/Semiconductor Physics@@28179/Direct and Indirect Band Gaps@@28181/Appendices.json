This means that $|\\mathbf{q}|$ is less than $0.2\\%$ of the size of the Brillouin zone. The crystal momentum of an electron, $\\mathbf{k}$, can take any value within the Brillouin zone. Therefore, the momentum contributed by the photon, $\\mathbf{q}$, is a minuscule perturbation to the electron's momentum on the scale of the $E$-$\\mathbf{k}$ diagram. The transition is thus nearly vertical ($\\Delta \\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{k}_f - \\mathbf{k}_i = \\mathbf{q} \\approx \\mathbf{0}$). This is crucial for optical processes. In a direct-gap semiconductor, where the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum occur at the same $\\mathbf{k}$-vector, this vertical transition is allowed and efficient. In an indirect-gap semiconductor, where a large change in momentum is required to bridge the gap, a photon alone cannot satisfy momentum conservation, and the assistance of a phonon is required, making the process much less efficient.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.37 \\times 10^{-3}}\n$$", "id": "2982231"}, {"introduction": "The properties of semiconductors are not immutable; they can be intentionally modified through a process known as band gap engineering.

In a direct-gap material, the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band occur at the same crystal momentum vector $\\mathbf{k}$ (typically the $\\Gamma$-point, $\\mathbf{k}=0$). In an indirect-gap material, they occur at different $\\mathbf{k}$ vectors. Optical transitions must conserve both energy and momentum. Since a photon carries negligible momentum compared to the crystal momentum scale, optical transitions in bulk indirect-gap materials require the participation of a lattice vibration (a phonon) to provide the necessary momentum change. This makes them much less efficient than direct-gap transitions.\n\nIn semiconductor nanocrystals (or quantum dots), the spatial confinement of charge carriers (electrons and holes) leads to a significant uncertainty in their momentum, as dictated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This momentum spread can provide the necessary crystal momentum to enable an optical transition even without the involvement of a phonon. This phenomenon is often referred to as a \"quasi-direct\" or \"zero-phonon\" transition.\n\nConsider a simplified model of an electron confined in a spherical nanocrystal of an indirect-gap semiconductor of radius $R$.
