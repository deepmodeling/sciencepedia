It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis is based on the Mott criterion for the metal-insulator transition. This criterion posits that a system of doped impurities transitions from an insulating state to a metallic state when the average separation between impurities becomes small enough for their electronic wavefunctions to overlap significantly. This overlap creates a delocalized \"impurity band,\" leading to metallic conduction even at absolute zero temperature.\n\nThe criterion is quantitatively expressed as:\n$$N_c^{1/3} a_B^* \\approx C$$\nwhere $N_c$ is the critical donor concentration for the transition, $a_B^*$ is the effective Bohr radius of the donor electron, and $C$ is a dimensionless constant of order unity. A commonly accepted value for this constant is $C \\approx 0.25$. If the donor concentration $N_D$ is greater than $N_c$, the sample is metallic. If $N_D < N_c$, it is insulating.\n\nFirst, we calculate the effective Bohr radius, $a_B^*$, for a donor in GaAs. The formula can be related to the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom, $a_B = 4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\hbar^2 / (m_e e^2) \\approx 0.529 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$:\n$$a_B^* = a_B \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon_r}{m^*/m_e} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values for GaAs, $\\varepsilon_r = 12.9$ and $m^*/m_e = 0.067$:\n$$a_B^* \\approx (0.529 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\left( \\frac{12.9}{0.067} \\right) \\approx (0.529 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\times 192.5 \\approx 101.8 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n$$a_B^* \\approx 1.02 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\nThis large effective Bohr radius (compared to $a_B$) is due to the high dielectric constant and low effective mass in GaAs, meaning the donor electron is weakly bound and has a spatially extended wavefunction.\n\nNext, we calculate the critical concentration $N_c$ using the Mott criterion with $C=0.25$:\n$$N_c \\approx \\left( \\frac{0.25}{a_B^*} \\right)^3$$\n$$N_c \\approx \\left( \\frac{0.25}{1.02 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm}} \\right)^3 \\approx (2.45 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}})^3$$\n$$N_c \\approx 14.7 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$$\n\nNow, we compare the sample's donor concentration $N_D$ with this critical value $N_c$. The problem states that compensation is negligible, so we can equate the donor concentration to the measured low-temperature electron concentration:\n$$N_D \\approx n_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$$\nComparing the two concentrations:\n$$N_D = 1.0 \\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\gg N_c \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$$\nThe donor concentration in the sample is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than the critical concentration for the metal-insulator transition. Therefore, the sample is decisively on the **metallic** side of the transition.\n\nThis conclusion is further supported by the experimental observation that $n(T)$ saturates at low temperatures. In an insulating sample ($N_D < N_c$), electrons would \"freeze out\" onto the localized donor sites as $T \\to 0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, causing the free carrier concentration to decrease exponentially towards zero. In a metallic sample ($N_D > N_c$), the donor electrons occupy delocalized states in an impurity band that has merged with the conduction band. There is no energy gap for excitation, so the electrons remain delocalized and available for conduction down to the lowest temperatures. The carrier concentration remains constant and equal to $N_D$, which is exactly what the saturation of $n(T)$ at $n_0 \\approx N_D$ signifies.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The sample is on the metallic side of the transition, because the measured $n_0$ significantly exceeds the critical concentration estimated from the donor wavefunction extent, and the saturation of $n(T)$ at low $T$ is consistent with suppressed freeze-out due to impurity band overlap.**\nThis statement is fully consistent with our derivation. It correctly identifies the sample as metallic. The justification is twofold and correct: (1) the donor concentration ($N_D \\approx n_0$) is much larger than the critical concentration $N_c$ derived from the wavefunction overlap model (Mott criterion), and (2) the saturation of $n(T)$ is the expected experimental signature of a metallic state in this context, signaling the absence of carrier freeze-out due to the formation of an impurity band.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The sample is on the insulating side of the transition, because saturation of $n(T)$ at low $T$ signals donor freeze-out and therefore incomplete ionization; since $n_0 \\approx 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ is below the typical metallic threshold, the sample must be insulating.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, it misinterprets the experimental evidence: saturation of carrier concentration is the *opposite* of freeze-out. Freeze-out implies an exponential *decrease*, not a saturation at a high constant value. Second, the claim that $10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ is \"below the typical metallic threshold\" is incorrect for GaAs, as our calculation has shown. The threshold is material-dependent. Consequently, the conclusion that the sample is insulating is wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The sample cannot be classified without additional data (such as mobility or conductivity), because the metal-insulator transition hinges on transport, not on carrier concentration or donor wavefunction overlap; therefore $n(T)$ is insufficient to decide.**\nThis statement presents a false dichotomy. While the MIT is fundamentally a phenomenon of electrical transport (conductivity $\\sigma \\to 0$ or $\\sigma > 0$ as $T \\to 0\\,\\mathrm{K}$), the physical mechanism driving the transition in this system *is* the overlap of donor wavefunctions, which is a direct function of the donor concentration. The Mott criterion explicitly links concentration to the transition. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the carrier concentration $n(T)$ provides powerful, albeit indirect, evidence of the transport regime. The absence of freeze-out is a cardinal sign of metallic behavior. Thus, the provided data are sufficient to make a well-founded classification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The sample is on the metallic side of the transition, but only because phonon scattering weakens at low $T$, which makes carriers more mobile even if donors remain localized; the donor wavefunction overlap criterion is irrelevant in this regime.**\nThis statement correctly concludes the sample is metallic but provides a fundamentally flawed explanation. The reduction of phonon scattering at low temperatures increases carrier mobility, but it does not create free carriers. If the donor states were localized (insulating side), a lack of carriers due to freeze-out would ensure zero conductivity at $T=0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, regardless of mobility. The essence of the metallic state is the *delocalization* of the electronic states themselves, which is precisely what the wavefunction overlap (Mott) criterion describes. To claim this criterion is \"irrelevant\" is to misunderstand the core physics of the transition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2974796"}]}
