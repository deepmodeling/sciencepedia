It represents a standard exercise in semiconductor physics. We will now proceed with the derivation from first principles as requested.\n\nThe concentration of electrons, $n$, in the conduction band and the concentration of holes, $p$, in the valence band are given in the nondegenerate (Maxwell-Boltzmann) limit by the following fundamental expressions:\n$$n = N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n$$p = N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $N_C$ and $N_V$ are the effective densities of states in the conduction and valence bands, respectively, $E_C$ and $E_V$ are the energies of the band edges, $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFirst, we derive the equilibrium relation between $n$ and $p$. This is achieved by computing the product $np$:\n$$np = \\left(N_C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)\\right) \\left(N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_F + E_F - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe Fermi level $E_F$ cancels in the exponent, leading to:\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C - E_V}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe energy difference $E_g = E_C - E_V$ is the semiconductor bandgap energy. Therefore, the product becomes:\n$$np = N_C N_V \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nAt a fixed temperature $T$, the right side of this equation is a constant, as $N_C$, $N_V$, and $E_g$ are material parameters that depend on temperature but not on doping or the Fermi level. This constant is defined as the square of the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i^2$. The intrinsic concentration $n_i$ is the concentration of electrons (or holes) in an undoped (intrinsic) semiconductor, where $n = p = n_i$. Thus, we have established the law of mass action for semiconductors:\n$$np = n_i^2$$\nThis is the first required relation.\n\nSecond, we formulate the condition of global charge neutrality. The semiconductor is electrically neutral in its entirety. The total density of positive charge must equal the total density of negative charge. The sources of positive charge are holes (concentration $p$) and ionized donor atoms (concentration $N_D^+$). The sources of negative charge are electrons (concentration $n$) and ionized acceptor atoms (concentration $N_A^-$). The neutrality condition is therefore:\n$$p + N_D^+ = n + N_A^-$$\nThe problem specifies the assumption of complete ionization for the shallow dopants. This implies that every donor atom has lost its electron, and every acceptor atom has gained an electron. Mathematically, this means:\n$$N_D^+ = N_D$$\n$$N_A^- = N_A$$\nwhere $N_D$ and $N_A$ are the total concentrations of donor and acceptor atoms, respectively. Substituting these into the neutrality equation yields the second required relation for a compensated semiconductor with full ionization:\n$$p + N_D = n + N_A$$\n\nThird, we must solve this system of two equations for the two unknowns, $n$ and $p$:\n1. $np = n_i^2$\n2. $p + N_D = n + N_A$\n\nWe can express $p$ from the first equation as $p = \\frac{n_i^2}{n}$ and substitute it into the second equation:\n$$\\frac{n_i^2}{n} + N_D = n + N_A$$\nTo eliminate the fraction, we multiply the entire equation by $n$ (noting that $n \\neq 0$):\n$$n_i^2 + nN_D = n^2 + nN_A$$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with $x=n$, gives:\n$$n^2 + n(N_A - N_D) - n_i^2 = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the electron concentration $n$. We solve it using the quadratic formula, $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, where $a=1$, $b = N_A - N_D$, and $c = -n_i^2$:\n$$n = \\frac{-(N_A - N_D) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2}$$\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nSince the electron concentration $n$ is a physical quantity, it must be positive. The term under the square root, $\\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$, is strictly greater than $|N_D - N_A|$. If we choose the negative sign, the numerator $(N_D - N_A) - \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}$ would be negative, yielding an unphysical negative concentration. Therefore, we must select the positive root:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A + \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nThis can be written more elegantly as:\n$$n = \\frac{N_D - N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}$$\nTo find the hole concentration $p$, we can follow a symmetrical procedure. From the neutrality equation, we express $n = p + N_D - N_A$. Substituting into the mass-action law $np = n_i^2$:\n$$(p + N_D - N_A)p = n_i^2$$\n$$p^2 + p(N_D - N_A) - n_i^2 = 0$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $p$ yields:\n$$p = \\frac{-(N_D - N_A) \\pm \\sqrt{(N_D - N_A)^2 - 4(1)(-n_i^2)}}{2}$$\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D \\pm \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nAgain, for $p$ to be a physically meaningful positive quantity, we must take the positive root:\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D + \\sqrt{(N_A - N_D)^2 + 4n_i^2}}{2}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$p = \\frac{N_A - N_D}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_A - N_D}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}$$\nThese are the exact, closed-form expressions for the electron and hole concentrations under the given assumptions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nn & p\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_D - N_A}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2} & \\frac{N_A - N_D}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{N_A - N_D}{2}\\right)^2 + n_i^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2836467"}, {"introduction": "The elegant simplicity of $np = n_i^2$ relies on the Maxwell-Boltzmann approximation, which fails in heavily doped (degenerate) semiconductors.

For a given local band edge, the electron concentration can be expressed using the clean-crystal effective density of states, $N_C^0$:\n$$n_{loc} = N_C^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{C,loc}-E_F}{k_B T}\\right) = N_C^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C' + \\delta E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis expression assumes that the shape of the density of states (and thus $N_C^0$) is not altered by the broadening, which is consistent with the model of convolving the clean-crystal DOS with the Gaussian kernel.\n\nThe macroscopic electron concentration $n(N)$ is the ensemble average of $n_{loc}$ over the Gaussian distribution of $\\delta E_C$:\n$$n(N) = \\langle n_{loc} \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} n_{loc} P_C(\\delta E_C) d(\\delta E_C)$$\nwhere $P_C(\\delta E_C) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_C} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\delta E_C)^2}{2\\sigma_C^2}\\right)$.\nSubstituting the expression for $n_{loc}$:\n$$n(N) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} N_C^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C' + \\delta E_C - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_C} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\delta E_C)^2}{2\\sigma_C^2}\\right) d(\\delta E_C)$$\n$$n(N) = N_C^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C' - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta E_C}{k_B T}\\right) P_C(\\delta E_C) d(\\delta E_C)$$\nThe integral is the expectation value $\\left\\langle \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta E_C}{k_B T}\\right) \\right\\rangle$. This is the moment-generating function $M_{\\delta E_C}(t)$ of a normal distribution $N(0, \\sigma_C^2)$ evaluated at $t = -1/(k_B T)$. The moment-generating function is $M_X(t) = \\exp(\\mu t + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t^2)$. For $\\mu=0$, this gives:\n$$\\left\\langle \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta E_C}{k_B T}\\right) \\right\\rangle = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_C^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\right)^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nThus, the electron concentration is:\n$$n(N) = N_C^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C' - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_C(N)^2}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nBy a perfectly symmetric argument for holes, where the local valence band edge is $E_{V,loc} = E_V' + \\delta E_V$, the local hole concentration is:\n$$p_{loc} = N_V^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F-E_{V,loc}}{k_B T}\\right) = N_V^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - (E_V' + \\delta E_V)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nAveraging over the distribution of $\\delta E_V$ involves the moment-generating function with $t = +1/(k_B T)$:\n$$\\left\\langle \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\delta E_V}{k_B T}\\right) \\right\\rangle = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_V^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\right)^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_V^2}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nThe macroscopic hole concentration is:\n$$p(N) = N_V^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V'}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_V(N)^2}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nNow we compute the mass-action product $n(N)p(N)$:\n$$n(N)p(N) = \\left[N_C^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C' - E_F}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)\\right] \\left[N_V^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_V'}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_V^2}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)\\right]$$\nThe terms involving the Fermi level, $\\exp(E_F/(k_B T))$ and $\\exp(-E_F/(k_B T))$, cancel out, yielding:\n$$n(N)p(N) = N_C^0 N_V^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_C' - E_V'}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_C^2 + \\sigma_V^2}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nWe now substitute the expressions for the effective bandgap and the broadening parameters. The new bandgap is $E_g'(N) = E_C' - E_V' = E_g^0 - \\Delta E_g(N) = E_g^0 - \\beta N^{1/3}$. The variances of the broadening are $\\sigma_C(N)^2 = (\\alpha_C \\sqrt{N})^2 = \\alpha_C^2 N$ and $\\sigma_V(N)^2 = (\\alpha_V \\sqrt{N})^2 = \\alpha_V^2 N$.\nThe product becomes:\n$$n(N)p(N) = N_C^0 N_V^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g^0 - \\beta N^{1/3}}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{(\\alpha_C^2 + \\alpha_V^2)N}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nWe can separate the exponential terms:\n$$n(N)p(N) = \\left[N_C^0 N_V^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_g^0}{k_B T}\\right)\\right] \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta N^{1/3}}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{(\\alpha_C^2 + \\alpha_V^2)N}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nThe term in the square brackets is the definition of the clean-crystal intrinsic mass-action product, $n_i^2$.\n$$n(N)p(N) = n_i^2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta N^{1/3}}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{(\\alpha_C^2 + \\alpha_V^2)N}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nFinally, the ratio $R(N)$ is found by dividing by $n_i^2$:\n$$R(N) = \\frac{n(N)p(N)}{n_i^2} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta N^{1/3}}{k_B T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{(\\alpha_C^2 + \\alpha_V^2)N}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nCombining the exponentials gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$R(N) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta N^{1/3}}{k_B T} + \\frac{(\\alpha_C^2 + \\alpha_V^2)N}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)$$\nThis expression quantifies the enhancement of the mass-action product due to both bandgap narrowing and disorder broadening as a function of dopant concentration $N$ and temperature $T$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta N^{1/3}}{k_B T} + \\frac{(\\alpha_C^2 + \\alpha_V^2)N}{2(k_B T)^2}\\right)}$$", "id": "3000420"}]}
