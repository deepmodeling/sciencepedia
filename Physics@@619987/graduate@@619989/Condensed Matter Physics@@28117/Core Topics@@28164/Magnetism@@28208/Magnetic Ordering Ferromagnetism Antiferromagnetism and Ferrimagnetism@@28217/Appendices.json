This suggests a perturbation approach around the zero-field state ($H=0$).\n\nFirst, let's determine the state at $H=0$.\nSetting $H=0$ in equation $(*_2)$, we get $M(2a_{M} + 2\\lambda L^{2}) = 0$. Since $a_M > 0$, $\\lambda > 0$, and $L^2 \\ge 0$, the term in the parenthesis $(2a_{M} + 2\\lambda L^{2})$ is strictly positive. Therefore, at zero field, the uniform magnetization is zero: $M_{H=0} = 0$. This is the expected behavior for an ideal antiferromagnet.\n\nWith $M=0$, equation $(*_1)$ gives the equilibrium value of the order parameter magnitude $L$ at zero field. Let's denote this value by $L_0$.\n$$\na_{L}(T) + 2b_{L}L_{0}^{2} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $L_0^2$:\n$$\nL_{0}^{2} = -\\frac{a_{L}(T)}{2b_{L}}\n$$\nSince we are at $T < T_{N}$, we have $a_{L}(T) = \\alpha(T - T_N) < 0$. Also, $b_{L}>0$. Thus, $L_{0}^{2}$ is positive, ensuring a real, non-zero value for $L_0$, which is consistent with being in the ordered phase.\n\nNow, we consider a weak applied field, $H \\neq 0$. We want to find $M$ to linear order in $H$. From equation $(*_2)$, we have an expression for $M$:\n$$\nM = \\frac{H}{2(a_{M} + \\lambda L^{2})}\n$$\nTo find $M$ to first order in $H$, we need to evaluate the denominator to zeroth order in $H$. In other words, we can approximate $L^2$ in the denominator by its zero-field value, $L_0^2$. Any field-induced correction to $L^2$ would lead to higher-order terms in $H$ for $M$.\n\nLet's verify this. From equation $(*_1)$, we can write $L^2 = -\\frac{a_{L}(T)}{2b_{L}} - \\frac{\\lambda}{2b_{L}} M^{2}$. Since $M$ is of order $H$, $M^2$ is of order $H^2$. Thus, the correction to $L^2$ is of order $H^2$:\n$$\nL^2 = L_0^2 + O(H^2)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $M$:\n$$\nM = \\frac{H}{2(a_{M} + \\lambda (L_0^2 + O(H^2)))} = \\frac{H}{2(a_{M} + \\lambda L_0^2) + O(H^2)}\n$$\nUsing the expansion $(A+x)^{-1} \\approx A^{-1}$ for small $x$ (in this case $x$ is $O(H^2)$), we find that retaining only the $L_0^2$ term in the denominator is sufficient to obtain $M$ to linear order in $H$.\n$$\nM(H,T) \\approx \\frac{H}{2(a_{M} + \\lambda L_0^2)}\n$$\nThis expression gives the magnetization, which is indeed linear in $H$. The problem asks for the final answer in terms of $H$, $a_{L}(T)$, $b_{L}$, $a_{M}$, and $\\lambda$. We substitute the expression for $L_0^2$:\n$$\nM(H,T) = \\frac{H}{2\\left(a_{M} + \\lambda \\left(-\\frac{a_{L}(T)}{2b_{L}}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\nSimplifying the denominator:\n$$\nM(H,T) = \\frac{H}{2a_{M} - \\frac{\\lambda a_{L}(T)}{b_{L}}}\n$$\nTo eliminate the fraction in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $b_L$:\n$$\nM(H,T) = \\frac{b_{L} H}{b_{L}(2a_{M}) - b_{L}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda a_{L}(T)}{b_{L}}\\right)} = \\frac{b_{L} H}{2a_{M} b_{L} - \\lambda a_{L}(T)}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the induced magnetization magnitude $M$ as a function of the applied field $H$, temperature $T$ (through $a_L(T)$), and the phenomenological Landau coefficients.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{b_{L} H}{2 a_{M} b_{L} - \\lambda a_{L}(T)}}\n$$", "id": "3003155"}]}
