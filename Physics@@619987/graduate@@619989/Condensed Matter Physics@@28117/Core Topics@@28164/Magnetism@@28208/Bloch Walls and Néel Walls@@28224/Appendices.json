For magnetizations to point \"away\", we need $\\mathbf{M}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} > 0$ and $\\mathbf{M}_2 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} < 0$. Both conditions again require $(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}) > 0$.\n    The charge density is:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}} = -(\\mathbf{M}_1 - \\mathbf{M}_2) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} = -(+M_s \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - (-M_s \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} = -(+2M_s \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} = -2M_s (\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}) $$\n    Since $(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}) > 0$ for this configuration, a tail-to-tail wall carries a negative bound charge, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}} < 0$.\n\n**4. Magnetostatic Stability**\nThe magnetostatic self-energy (demagnetization energy) is proportional to the square of the bound charge density integrated over the surfaces, $E_d \\propto \\int \\sigma_m^2 dS$. To minimize this energy, the system will favor configurations that minimize $|\\sigma_m|$.\nThe wall charge magnitude is $|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}}| = 2 M_s |(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}})|$. This energy cost is minimized when $|\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}| = 0$, which means $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}$ is perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. Since $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}$ is in the $xy$-plane, this requires $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}$ to be parallel to $\\pm\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\nA wall with $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ is a straight line along the $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ direction (perpendicular to the strip edges). Such a wall has $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}} = 0$ and is called a neutral wall. This is the magnetostatically preferred orientation for a $180^\\circ$ wall separating domains with magnetization along $\\pm \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. Any other orientation will create a charged wall with a large energy penalty.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For a head-to-head wall, the bound surface charge density at the wall is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}} = 2 M_s \\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}\\right) > 0$ whenever the wall normal has a component along $+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, while a tail-to-tail wall carries the same magnitude with opposite sign. At the strip edges, the bound surface charges in a given domain are $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{edge}}(y=0) = - M_s$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{edge}}(y=w) = + M_s$. Because the magnetostatic self-energy scales with $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}}^2$, the wall tends to minimize $|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}}|$ by rotating so that $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} \\to 0$ (a neutral wall with the wall line parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$), or by shifting/tilting so that its charged pole density is partially compensated by nearby edge segments of opposite sign. Head-to-head and tail-to-tail walls are equally costly in magnitude but carry opposite signs.**\n\n-   The formula for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}}$ for a head-to-head wall matches our derivation, as does the conclusion that it is positive when $(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}) > 0$.\n-   The claim that a tail-to-tail wall has opposite sign but same magnitude also matches our derivation ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}} = -2M_s (\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}})$).\n-   The calculation of edge charges is correct for the domain with $\\mathbf{M}=+M_s\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. The phrasing \"in a given domain\" is slightly imprecise but not strictly incorrect.\n-   The stability analysis is correct: magnetostatic energy favors neutral walls ($\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} = 0$), which correspond to a wall line direction parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n-   The possibility of charge compensation by interaction with edge charges is a valid physical consideration.\n-   The final statement on cost and sign is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Néel walls in thin films are magnetostatically neutral because $\\mathbf{M}$ remains in-plane, so $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{M} = 0$. Only Bloch walls carry bound magnetic charge; therefore, wall orientation within the film plane has no magnetostatic consequence for stability.**\n\n-   This is fundamentally incorrect. $\\mathbf{M}$ remaining in-plane does not imply $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{M} = 0$. $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{M} = \\partial_x M_x + \\partial_y M_y$. If $\\mathbf{M}$ varies within the plane, its divergence can be non-zero, leading to bound charges. Head-to-head and tail-to-tail walls are prime examples.\n-   The claim that only Bloch walls carry charge is false. In thin films, Bloch walls create surface charges on the film's top and bottom faces, while Néel walls can create charges within the plane, as shown.\n-   The conclusion that orientation has no magnetostatic consequence is false, as wall energy strongly depends on orientation via the factor $(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}})$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In a head-to-head Néel wall within the strip, both edges at $y=0$ and $y=w$ carry the same sign of bound surface charge in a given domain, producing a symmetric attraction that pins the wall perpendicular to the edges (i.e., with $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$). Magnetostatic energy is minimized when the wall normal is parallel to the magnetization to maximize charge separation.**\n\n-   The first statement is false. We calculated that for a given domain, the edge charges at $y=0$ and $y=w$ have opposite signs.\n-   Pinning with $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ corresponds to a wall line along $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. This orientation maximizes $|\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}}|$ and thus maximizes the magnetostatic energy. It is the most unstable orientation, not a stable pinned one.\n-   The last sentence is nonsensical. Minimizing energy involves minimizing charge, not maximizing charge separation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The correct edge charge convention is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{edge}} = - \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$, so a domain with $\\mathbf{M} = + M_s \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ carries negative charge at $y=0$ and positive charge at $y=w$. This opposite-sign edge charge stabilizes a head-to-head wall when it is perpendicular to the edges, because the wall’s bound charge vanishes in that orientation, whereas a tail-to-tail wall remains charged and is unstable against rotation toward $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.**\n\n-   The proposed formula $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{edge}} = - \\mathbf{M} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ is inconsistent with the result it claims to produce. Using this formula, for $\\mathbf{M}=+M_s\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, we get $\\sigma(y=0)=+M_s$ and $\\sigma(y=w)=-M_s$, the opposite of what is stated. The statement text is correct about the signs, but the formula it cites is wrong.\n-   A wall \"perpendicular to the edges\" has its line parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, meaning its normal $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}$ is parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. In this orientation, $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}}=0$, so the wall is neutral ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{wall}}=0$).\n-   The claim that a tail-to-tail wall \"remains charged\" in this same orientation is false. Any $180^\\circ$ wall in this geometry is neutral when its normal is orthogonal to the domain magnetizations. The distinction between head-to-head and tail-to-tail is irrelevant for a neutral wall.\n-   The statement that a wall is unstable \"against rotation toward $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\" is also backwards. An unstable wall would rotate *away* from the high-energy configuration ($\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{\\mathrm{w}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$), not toward it.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2972945"}]}
