The problem is scientifically sound and well-posed. We proceed with the derivation in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Pauli Paramagnetic Susceptibility ($\\chi_P$)\n\nThe Pauli paramagnetism arises from the alignment of electron spins with an external magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The energy of an electron with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ and spin quantum number $s_z = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}$ is given by\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}, s_z) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} - 2 s_z \\mu_B B$$\nwhere $m$ is the band mass and $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m}$ is the Bohr magneton. Spin-up electrons ($\\uparrow$, $s_z=+\\frac{1}{2}$) have their energy lowered by $\\mu_B B$, while spin-down electrons ($\\downarrow$, $s_z=-\\frac{1}{2}$) have their energy raised by $\\mu_B B$.\n\nAt $T=0$, electrons occupy all available states up to the chemical potential $\\mu$. In the presence of the magnetic field, the densities of spin-up ($n_\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($n_\\downarrow$) electrons are determined by filling states up to $\\mu$. Let $g_0(E)$ be the total density of states (DOS) for both spins per unit volume in the absence of a magnetic field. The DOS for a single spin species is $\\frac{1}{2}g_0(E)$.\nThe number densities are:\n$$n_\\uparrow = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E) f(E-\\mu_B B - \\mu) dE = \\int_{\\mu_B B}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E'+\\mu_B B) f(E' - \\mu) dE'$$\n$$n_\\downarrow = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E) f(E+\\mu_B B - \\mu) dE = \\int_{-\\mu_B B}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E'-\\mu_B B) f(E' - \\mu) dE'$$\nAt $T=0$, the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f(x)$ is a step function. More simply, we can see that the up-spin band is filled to energy $\\mu+\\mu_B B$ and the down-spin band is filled to $\\mu-\\mu_B B$ in their respective energy scales. In a common energy scale, this means all up-spin states are filled to an energy $\\mu$, and their kinetic energies go up to $\\mu+\\mu_B B$. All down-spin states are filled up to $\\mu$, with kinetic energy up to $\\mu-\\mu_B B$.\nThe number densities for each spin species are:\n$$n_\\uparrow = \\int_0^\\mu \\frac{1}{2}g(E+\\mu_B B) dE \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_\\downarrow = \\int_0^\\mu \\frac{1}{2}g(E-\\mu_B B) dE$$\nA simpler, equivalent approach for weak fields ($\\mu_B B \\ll \\mu \\approx E_F$) is to expand the integrals.

Each spin-up electron contributes $+\\mu_B$ and each spin-down electron contributes $-\\mu_B$.\n$$M_P = \\mu_B(n_\\uparrow - n_\\downarrow) = \\mu_B \\left[ \\left(\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}g(E_F)\\mu_B B\\right) - \\left(\\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}g(E_F)\\mu_B B\\right) \\right]$$\n$$M_P = \\mu_B^2 g(E_F) B$$\nThe magnetic susceptibility is defined as $\\chi_P \\simeq \\mu_0 \\frac{\\partial M_P}{\\partial B}$ for a weak response.\n$$\\chi_P = \\mu_0 \\mu_B^2 g(E_F)$$\n\n### Part 2: Landau Diamagnetic Susceptibility ($\\chi_L$)\n\nLandau diamagnetism arises from the quantization of electron orbital motion in a magnetic field.

The magnetization is $M=-\\partial \\Omega/\\partial B$. By isolating the oscillatory part of $D_{B}(E)$ originating from the discrete Landau levels and using mathematically controlled tools valid for advanced analysis (such as the Poisson summation formula), derive the multiplicative damping factorâ€”known as the Dingle factorâ€”that multiplies each harmonic of the oscillatory magnetization due to the finite lifetime $\\tau$. Express your final answer for the Dingle factor $R_{D}(r)$, where $r\\in\\mathbb{N}$ labels the harmonic, in terms of $\\omega_{c}$ and $\\tau$.\n\nThen, using the expression you obtained, provide a physically grounded argument based on the structure of the grand potential and magnetization explaining why this damping factor does not modify the linear magnetic susceptibility in the limit $B\\to 0$, which is defined by the coefficient of the term linear in $B$ in the smooth (non-oscillatory) magnetization.\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for $R_{D}(r)$. No numerical evaluation or rounding is required, and no units should be attached in the final expression.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the Dingle damping factor for magneto-oscillations in a 3D electron gas and an explanation for why it does not affect the linear magnetic susceptibility.\n\nThe starting point is the grand potential $\\Omega$, which depends on the density of states (DOS) $D_B(E)$. The DOS for an ideal 3D electron gas in a magnetic field $B$ is a sum of contributions from each Landau level, indexed by $n \\ge 0$:\n$$\nD_{\\text{ideal}}(E) = \\frac{|e|B\\sqrt{2m}}{\\pi^2\\hbar^2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\Theta(E - E_n^{(0)})}{\\sqrt{E - E_n^{(0)}}}\n$$\nwhere $E_n^{(0)} = \\hbar\\omega_c(n+1/2)$ is the energy of the $n$-th Landau level (the kinetic energy part for motion along the field is included in this structure), a spin degeneracy factor of $2$ has been included, $\\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function, and $\\omega_c = |e|B/m$ is the cyclotron frequency. The singularities at the band edges $E = E_n^{(0)}$ give rise to oscillations in thermodynamic properties.\n\nThe problem states that elastic scattering introduces a finite quantum lifetime $\\tau$, which is modeled by a Lorentzian broadening of each Landau level with a half-width at half-maximum of $\\Gamma = \\hbar/(2\\tau)$. The broadened DOS, $D_B(E)$, can be obtained by convolving the ideal DOS with a Lorentzian distribution:\n$$\nL(E) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma}{E^2 + \\Gamma^2}\n$$\nThus, $D_B(E) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} D_{\\text{ideal}}(E') L(E - E') dE'$. An equivalent and more direct approach in formal derivations is to introduce a complex self-energy, which results in replacing the energy $E$ in the denominator of the Green's function with $E+i\\Gamma$. This leads to a broadened DOS of the form:\n$$\nD_B(E) = \\frac{|e|B\\sqrt{2m}}{\\pi^2\\hbar^2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\text{Re}\\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E - E_n^{(0)} + i\\Gamma}} \\right]\n$$\nTo find the oscillatory part of any thermodynamic potential, one typically relies on the Poisson summation formula, which converts the sum over discrete levels $n$ into a sum over harmonics $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The formula states that for a sufficiently smooth function $f(x)$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} f(n) = \\int_0^{\\infty} f(x)dx + \\frac{1}{2}f(0) + 2 \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\int_0^{\\infty} f(x)\\cos(2\\pi r x)dx\n$$\nThe oscillatory part of the DOS, and consequently of $\\Omega$ and $M$, arises from the sum over harmonics $r \\ge 1$. The non-oscillatory (smooth) part arises from the first integral term.\n\nInstead of a full derivation from the DOS, we can use the structure of the problem to our advantage. The problem asks to isolate the oscillatory part of $D_B(E)$. The oscillatory part of the ideal DOS, $D_{\\text{ideal, osc}}(E)$, which arises from the Poisson summation, is a sum of sinusoidal functions of energy:\n$$\nD_{\\text{ideal, osc}}(E) \\propto \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} A_r \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r (E - \\mu_0)}{\\hbar\\omega_c} + \\phi_r\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A_r$ and $\\phi_r$ are coefficients and phases that depend on the dimensionality and the harmonic index $r$, and $\\mu_0$ is the chemical potential at zero field. The argument of the cosine can be written more generally in terms of the area of the extremal orbit in k-space, but for a parabolic band, it simplifies to being proportional to energy.\n\nThe effect of the lifetime broadening is found by convolving this oscillatory part with the Lorentzian $L(E)$:\n$$\nD_{B, \\text{osc}}(E) = D_{\\text{ideal, osc}}(E) * L(E)\n$$\nLet's consider a single harmonic, $f(E) = \\cos(kE+\\phi)$, where $k = 2\\pi r / (\\hbar\\omega_c)$. The convolution is:\n$$\n(f * L)(E) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos(kE'+\\phi) \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\frac{\\Gamma}{(E-E')^2 + \\Gamma^2} dE'\n$$\nThis integral is the real part of the convolution of $\\exp(i(kE'+\\phi))$ with the Lorentzian. The convolution in the energy domain is equivalent to multiplication in the Fourier domain. The Fourier transform of the Lorentzian $L(E)$ with respect to energy $E$ is $\\mathcal{F}[L(E)](k) = \\exp(-\\Gamma|k|)$.\nThe convolution theorem states that $\\mathcal{F}[f*L] = \\mathcal{F}[f] \\cdot \\mathcal{F}[L]$. The convolution $(f*L)(E)$ is therefore a sinusoidal function whose amplitude is multiplied by the value of the Lorentzian's Fourier transform at the frequency $k$ of the sinusoid.\n$$\n(f * L)(E) = \\cos(kE+\\phi) \\times \\exp(-\\Gamma|k|)\n$$\nSince $r \\ge 1$, we have $k = 2\\pi r / (\\hbar\\omega_c) > 0$. The multiplicative damping factor for the $r$-th harmonic is thus $\\exp(-\\Gamma k)$. This is the Dingle factor, $R_D(r)$.\n$$\nR_D(r) = \\exp\\left(-\\Gamma \\frac{2\\pi r}{\\hbar\\omega_c}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for the broadening, $\\Gamma=\\hbar/(2\\tau)$, we obtain the final form:\n$$\nR_D(r) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\tau} \\frac{2\\pi r}{\\hbar\\omega_c}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi r}{\\omega_c \\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThis factor multiplies the amplitude of each harmonic $r$ in the oscillatory part of the grand potential, and subsequently in the oscillatory magnetization $M_{osc}$.\n\nNow, we address the second part of the problem: why this factor does not modify the linear magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ in the limit $B \\to 0$.\n\nThe total magnetization $M$ is the sum of a smooth, non-oscillatory part $M_{smooth}$ and an oscillatory part $M_{osc}$: $M(B) = M_{smooth}(B) + M_{osc}(B)$. The linear magnetic susceptibility is defined as the coefficient of the linear response to the field:\n$$\n\\chi = \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M(B)}{B}\n$$\n$M_{smooth}$ is responsible for the Pauli paramagnetism and the steady Landau diamagnetism. In the low-field expansion, $M_{smooth}(B) = \\chi_L B + O(B^3)$, where $\\chi_L$ is the well-known Landau susceptibility. This term arises from the non-oscillatory part of the grand potential.\n\nThe oscillatory part, $M_{osc}$, is a sum over harmonics, with the amplitude of each harmonic being proportional to some power of $B$ (typically $B^{1/2}$ for 3D) and multiplied by the damping factors, including the Dingle factor $R_D(r)$ and a thermal damping factor $R_T(r)$. The full amplitude of the $r$-th harmonic of $M_{osc}$ has the form:\n$$\nM_{osc,r} \\propto B^{1/2} R_T(r) R_D(r) \\sin\\left(2\\pi r\\frac{\\mu}{\\hbar\\omega_c} + \\phi'_r\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting our derived Dingle factor and the expression for $\\omega_c$:\n$$\nR_D(r) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi r m}{|e|B\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nLet's analyze the contribution of the oscillatory part to the susceptibility:\n$$\n\\chi_{osc} = \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M_{osc}(B)}{B}\n$$\nThe behavior of each term in $M_{osc}$ as $B \\to 0$ is dominated by the Dingle factor. For any finite lifetime $\\tau$ and harmonic $r \\ge 1$, the argument of the exponential, $-\\pi r m / (|e|B\\tau)$, tends to $-\\infty$ as $B \\to 0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{B\\to 0} R_D(r) = \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\text{const.}}{B}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe exponential decay is much stronger than any polynomial growth. Therefore, the entire oscillatory component of the magnetization, $M_{osc}(B)$, vanishes in the limit $B \\to 0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M_{osc}(B)}{B} = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the linear susceptibility is determined solely by the smooth part of the magnetization:\n$$\n\\chi = \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M_{smooth}(B)}{B} + \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M_{osc}(B)}{B} = \\chi_L + 0 = \\chi_L\n$$\nPhysically, the existence of quantum oscillations (the de Haas-van Alphen effect) requires the Landau level separation $\\hbar\\omega_c$ to be larger than the level broadening, which is of order $\\Gamma = \\hbar/(2\\tau)$. This condition is $\\omega_c \\tau \\gg 1$. In the limit $B \\to 0$, we have $\\omega_c \\to 0$, so this condition is maximally violated. The discrete Landau-level structure is completely washed out by scattering, and the system behaves as if there were a continuous spectrum of states. The Dingle factor mathematically captures this suppression of oscillations. The linear susceptibility, being a property of the $B \\to 0$ regime, is therefore determined by the response of this effective continuum, which corresponds to the smooth, non-oscillatory part of the thermodynamic potential. The Dingle factor, a hallmark of the quantum oscillatory regime, is irrelevant to this limit.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi r}{\\omega_{c} \\tau}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2998868"}]}
