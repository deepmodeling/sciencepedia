The problem is scientifically sound and well-posed. We proceed with the derivation in three parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Pauli Paramagnetic Susceptibility ($\\chi_P$)\n\nThe Pauli paramagnetism arises from the alignment of electron spins with an external magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The energy of an electron with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ and spin quantum number $s_z = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}$ is given by\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}, s_z) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} - 2 s_z \\mu_B B$$\nwhere $m$ is the band mass and $\\mu_B = \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m}$ is the Bohr magneton. Spin-up electrons ($\\uparrow$, $s_z=+\\frac{1}{2}$) have their energy lowered by $\\mu_B B$, while spin-down electrons ($\\downarrow$, $s_z=-\\frac{1}{2}$) have their energy raised by $\\mu_B B$.\n\nAt $T=0$, electrons occupy all available states up to the chemical potential $\\mu$. In the presence of the magnetic field, the densities of spin-up ($n_\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($n_\\downarrow$) electrons are determined by filling states up to $\\mu$. Let $g_0(E)$ be the total density of states (DOS) for both spins per unit volume in the absence of a magnetic field. The DOS for a single spin species is $\\frac{1}{2}g_0(E)$.\nThe number densities are:\n$$n_\\uparrow = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E) f(E-\\mu_B B - \\mu) dE = \\int_{\\mu_B B}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E'+\\mu_B B) f(E' - \\mu) dE'$$\n$$n_\\downarrow = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E) f(E+\\mu_B B - \\mu) dE = \\int_{-\\mu_B B}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2}g_0(E'-\\mu_B B) f(E' - \\mu) dE'$$\nAt $T=0$, the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f(x)$ is a step function. More simply, we can see that the up-spin band is filled to energy $\\mu+\\mu_B B$ and the down-spin band is filled to $\\mu-\\mu_B B$ in their respective energy scales. In a common energy scale, this means all up-spin states are filled to an energy $\\mu$, and their kinetic energies go up to $\\mu+\\mu_B B$. All down-spin states are filled up to $\\mu$, with kinetic energy up to $\\mu-\\mu_B B$.\nThe number densities for each spin species are:\n$$n_\\uparrow = \\int_0^\\mu \\frac{1}{2}g(E+\\mu_B B) dE \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_\\downarrow = \\int_0^\\mu \\frac{1}{2}g(E-\\mu_B B) dE$$\nA simpler, equivalent approach for weak fields ($\\mu_B B \\ll \\mu \\approx E_F$) is to expand the integrals.

Each spin-up electron contributes $+\\mu_B$ and each spin-down electron contributes $-\\mu_B$.\n$$M_P = \\mu_B(n_\\uparrow - n_\\downarrow) = \\mu_B \\left[ \\left(\\frac{n}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}g(E_F)\\mu_B B\\right) - \\left(\\frac{n}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}g(E_F)\\mu_B B\\right) \\right]$$\n$$M_P = \\mu_B^2 g(E_F) B$$\nThe magnetic susceptibility is defined as $\\chi_P \\simeq \\mu_0 \\frac{\\partial M_P}{\\partial B}$ for a weak response.\n$$\\chi_P = \\mu_0 \\mu_B^2 g(E_F)$$\n\n### Part 2: Landau Diamagnetic Susceptibility ($\\chi_L$)\n\nLandau diamagnetism arises from the quantization of electron orbital motion in a magnetic field.

The magnetization is $M=-\\partial \\Omega/\\partial B$. By isolating the oscillatory part of $D_{B}(E)$ originating from the discrete Landau levels and using mathematically controlled tools valid for advanced analysis (such as the Poisson summation formula), derive the multiplicative damping factor—known as the Dingle factor—that multiplies each harmonic of the oscillatory magnetization due to the finite lifetime $\\tau$.

No numerical evaluation or rounding is required, and no units should be attached in the final expression.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the Dingle damping factor for magneto-oscillations in a 3D electron gas and an explanation for why it does not affect the linear magnetic susceptibility.\n\nThe starting point is the grand potential $\\Omega$, which depends on the density of states (DOS) $D_B(E)$. The DOS for an ideal 3D electron gas in a magnetic field $B$ is a sum of contributions from each Landau level, indexed by $n \\ge 0$:\n$$\nD_{\\text{ideal}}(E) = \\frac{|e|B\\sqrt{2m}}{\\pi^2\\hbar^2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\Theta(E - E_n^{(0)})}{\\sqrt{E - E_n^{(0)}}}\n$$\nwhere $E_n^{(0)} = \\hbar\\omega_c(n+1/2)$ is the energy of the $n$-th Landau level (the kinetic energy part for motion along the field is included in this structure), a spin degeneracy factor of $2$ has been included, $\\Theta$ is the Heaviside step function, and $\\omega_c = |e|B/m$ is the cyclotron frequency. The singularities at the band edges $E = E_n^{(0)}$ give rise to oscillations in thermodynamic properties.\n\nThe problem states that elastic scattering introduces a finite quantum lifetime $\\tau$, which is modeled by a Lorentzian broadening of each Landau level with a half-width at half-maximum of $\\Gamma = \\hbar/(2\\tau)$. The broadened DOS, $D_B(E)$, can be obtained by convolving the ideal DOS with a Lorentzian distribution:\n$$\nL(E) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma}{E^2 + \\Gamma^2}\n$$\nThus, $D_B(E) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} D_{\\text{ideal}}(E') L(E - E') dE'$. An equivalent and more direct approach in formal derivations is to introduce a complex self-energy, which results in replacing the energy $E$ in the denominator of the Green's function with $E+i\\Gamma$. This leads to a broadened DOS of the form:\n$$\nD_B(E) = \\frac{|e|B\\sqrt{2m}}{\\pi^2\\hbar^2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\text{Re}\\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{E - E_n^{(0)} + i\\Gamma}} \\right]\n$$\nTo find the oscillatory part of any thermodynamic potential, one typically relies on the Poisson summation formula, which converts the sum over discrete levels $n$ into a sum over harmonics $r \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The formula states that for a sufficiently smooth function $f(x)$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} f(n) = \\int_0^{\\infty} f(x)dx + \\frac{1}{2}f(0) + 2 \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\int_0^{\\infty} f(x)\\cos(2\\pi r x)dx\n$$\nThe oscillatory part of the DOS, and consequently of $\\Omega$ and $M$, arises from the sum over harmonics $r \\ge 1$. The non-oscillatory (smooth) part arises from the first integral term.\n\nInstead of a full derivation from the DOS, we can use the structure of the problem to our advantage. The problem asks to isolate the oscillatory part of $D_B(E)$. The oscillatory part of the ideal DOS, $D_{\\text{ideal, osc}}(E)$, which arises from the Poisson summation, is a sum of sinusoidal functions of energy:\n$$\nD_{\\text{ideal, osc}}(E) \\propto \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} A_r \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r (E - \\mu_0)}{\\hbar\\omega_c} + \\phi_r\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A_r$ and $\\phi_r$ are coefficients and phases that depend on the dimensionality and the harmonic index $r$, and $\\mu_0$ is the chemical potential at zero field. The argument of the cosine can be written more generally in terms of the area of the extremal orbit in k-space, but for a parabolic band, it simplifies to being proportional to energy.\n\nThe effect of the lifetime broadening is found by convolving this oscillatory part with the Lorentzian $L(E)$:\n$$\nD_{B, \\text{osc}}(E) = D_{\\text{ideal, osc}}(E) * L(E)\n$$\nLet's consider a single harmonic, $f(E) = \\cos(kE+\\phi)$, where $k = 2\\pi r / (\\hbar\\omega_c)$. The convolution is:\n$$\n(f * L)(E) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\cos(kE'+\\phi) \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\frac{\\Gamma}{(E-E')^2 + \\Gamma^2} dE'\n$$\nThis integral is the real part of the convolution of $\\exp(i(kE'+\\phi))$ with the Lorentzian. The convolution in the energy domain is equivalent to multiplication in the Fourier domain. The Fourier transform of the Lorentzian $L(E)$ with respect to energy $E$ is $\\mathcal{F}[L(E)](k) = \\exp(-\\Gamma|k|)$.\nThe convolution theorem states that $\\mathcal{F}[f*L] = \\mathcal{F}[f] \\cdot \\mathcal{F}[L]$. The convolution $(f*L)(E)$ is therefore a sinusoidal function whose amplitude is multiplied by the value of the Lorentzian's Fourier transform at the frequency $k$ of the sinusoid.\n$$\n(f * L)(E) = \\cos(kE+\\phi) \\times \\exp(-\\Gamma|k|)\n$$\nSince $r \\ge 1$, we have $k = 2\\pi r / (\\hbar\\omega_c) > 0$. The multiplicative damping factor for the $r$-th harmonic is thus $\\exp(-\\Gamma k)$. This is the Dingle factor, $R_D(r)$.\n$$\nR_D(r) = \\exp\\left(-\\Gamma \\frac{2\\pi r}{\\hbar\\omega_c}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for the broadening, $\\Gamma=\\hbar/(2\\tau)$, we obtain the final form:\n$$\nR_D(r) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\tau} \\frac{2\\pi r}{\\hbar\\omega_c}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi r}{\\omega_c \\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThis factor multiplies the amplitude of each harmonic $r$ in the oscillatory part of the grand potential, and subsequently in the oscillatory magnetization $M_{osc}$.\n\nNow, we address the second part of the problem: why this factor does not modify the linear magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ in the limit $B \\to 0$.\n\nThe total magnetization $M$ is the sum of a smooth, non-oscillatory part $M_{smooth}$ and an oscillatory part $M_{osc}$: $M(B) = M_{smooth}(B) + M_{osc}(B)$. The linear magnetic susceptibility is defined as the coefficient of the linear response to the field:\n$$\n\\chi = \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M(B)}{B}\n$$\n$M_{smooth}$ is responsible for the Pauli paramagnetism and the steady Landau diamagnetism. In the low-field expansion, $M_{smooth}(B) = \\chi_L B + O(B^3)$, where $\\chi_L$ is the well-known Landau susceptibility. This term arises from the non-oscillatory part of the grand potential.\n\nThe oscillatory part, $M_{osc}$, is a sum over harmonics, with the amplitude of each harmonic being proportional to some power of $B$ (typically $B^{1/2}$ for 3D) and multiplied by the damping factors, including the Dingle factor $R_D(r)$ and a thermal damping factor $R_T(r)$. The full amplitude of the $r$-th harmonic of $M_{osc}$ has the form:\n$$\nM_{osc,r} \\propto B^{1/2} R_T(r) R_D(r) \\sin\\left(2\\pi r\\frac{\\mu}{\\hbar\\omega_c} + \\phi'_r\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting our derived Dingle factor and the expression for $\\omega_c$:\n$$\nR_D(r) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi r m}{|e|B\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nLet's analyze the contribution of the oscillatory part to the susceptibility:\n$$\n\\chi_{osc} = \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M_{osc}(B)}{B}\n$$\nThe behavior of each term in $M_{osc}$ as $B \\to 0$ is dominated by the Dingle factor. For any finite lifetime $\\tau$ and harmonic $r \\ge 1$, the argument of the exponential, $-\\pi r m / (|e|B\\tau)$, tends to $-\\infty$ as $B \\to 0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{B\\to 0} R_D(r) = \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\text{const.}}{B}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe exponential decay is much stronger than any polynomial growth. Therefore, the entire oscillatory component of the magnetization, $M_{osc}(B)$, vanishes in the limit $B \\to 0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M_{osc}(B)}{B} = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the linear susceptibility is determined solely by the smooth part of the magnetization:\n$$\n\\chi = \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M_{smooth}(B)}{B} + \\lim_{B\\to 0} \\frac{M_{osc}(B)}{B} = \\chi_L + 0 = \\chi_L\n$$\nPhysically, the existence of quantum oscillations (the de Haas-van Alphen effect) requires the Landau level separation $\\hbar\\omega_c$ to be larger than the level broadening, which is of order $\\Gamma = \\hbar/(2\\tau)$. This condition is $\\omega_c \\tau \\gg 1$. In the limit $B \\to 0$, we have $\\omega_c \\to 0$, so this condition is maximally violated. The discrete Landau-level structure is completely washed out by scattering, and the system behaves as if there were a continuous spectrum of states. The Dingle factor mathematically captures this suppression of oscillations. The linear susceptibility, being a property of the $B \\to 0$ regime, is therefore determined by the response of this effective continuum, which corresponds to the smooth, non-oscillatory part of the thermodynamic potential. The Dingle factor, a hallmark of the quantum oscillatory regime, is irrelevant to this limit.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi r}{\\omega_{c} \\tau}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2998868"}]}
