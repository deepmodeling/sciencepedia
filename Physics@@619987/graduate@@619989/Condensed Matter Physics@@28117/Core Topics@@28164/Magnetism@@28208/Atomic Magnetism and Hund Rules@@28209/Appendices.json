It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantum mechanics as applied to multi-electron atoms. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to determine a unique solution for the ground-state quantum numbers $(S, L, J)$. The language is objective and formal. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Microstate Counting and Term Determination**\n\nA $d$ subshell ($l=2$) has $2l+1 = 5$ spatial orbitals. Each orbital can hold two electrons of opposite spin, so the total number of single-electron states is $2(2l+1) = 10$. A microstate is a specific assignment of the three electrons to these $10$ states. According to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same single-electron state, so each microstate is a unique combination of three distinct states chosen from the available ten. The total number of microstates for the $d^3$ configuration is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$ \\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 120 $$\nEach microstate is characterized by a total spin projection $M_S = \\sum_i m_{s,i}$ and a total orbital angular momentum projection $M_L = \\sum_i m_{l,i}$.\n\nThe possible total spin values $S$ are determined by the allowed values of $M_S$. With three electrons, $M_S$ can range from $3 \\times (-\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\frac{3}{2}$ to $3 \\times (+\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{3}{2}$. The possible values for $M_S$ are thus $\\{-\\frac{3}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2}\\}$. This implies that the possible total spin quantum numbers $S$ for the system are $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ (a spin quartet) and $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ (a spin doublet).\n\nWe now construct the allowed $(S, L)$ terms, starting with the highest spin state, as guided by Hund's first rule.\n\n**States with Maximum Spin ($S=\\frac{3}{2}$)**\nTo achieve the maximum total spin projection, $M_S = \\frac{3}{2}$, all three electrons must have spin up ($m_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$). By the Pauli exclusion principle, they must therefore occupy three different spatial orbitals, i.e., they must have distinct $m_l$ values. The available $m_l$ values are $\\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$. We list the possible combinations of three distinct $m_l$ values and the corresponding total projection $M_L$:\n- $\\{2, 1, 0\\} \\implies M_L = 3$\n- $\\{2, 1, -1\\} \\implies M_L = 2$\n- $\\{2, 1, -2\\} \\implies M_L = 1$\n- $\\{2, 0, -1\\} \\implies M_L = 1$\n- $\\{2, 0, -2\\} \\implies M_L = 0$\n- $\\{1, 0, -1\\} \\implies M_L = 0$\nBy symmetry, we also have negative $M_L$ values. Counting the number of microstates for each value of $M_L$ in the $M_S = \\frac{3}{2}$ sector:\n- $M_L = 3$: $1$ state $(\\{2,1,0\\})$\n- $M_L = 2$: $1$ state $(\\{2,1,-1\\})$\n- $M_L = 1$: $2$ states $(\\{2,1,-2\\}, \\{2,0,-1\\})$\n- $M_L = 0$: $2$ states $(\\{2,0,-2\\}, \\{1,0,-1\\})$\n- $M_L = -1$: $2$ states $(\\{2,-1,-2\\}, \\{1,0,-2\\})$\n- $M_L = -2$: $1$ state $(\\{1,-1,-2\\})$\n- $M_L = -3$: $1$ state $(\\{0,-1,-2\\})$\n\nA spectroscopic term $^{2S+1}L$ corresponds to a multiplet of $(2S+1)(2L+1)$ microstates. The set of states with $M_S=\\frac{3}{2}$ must form complete sets of $M_L$ values for one or more values of $L$. The highest $M_L$ value is $M_L^{max}=3$. This signifies the presence of a term with $L=3$ (an $F$ term). Since this occurs for $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ states, the term is a quartet F, denoted $^4F$. This term requires one microstate for each integer $M_L$ from $-3$ to $3$.\n\nSubtracting this set of $2L+1 = 7$ states (one for each $M_L \\in \\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$) from our distribution for $M_S=\\frac{3}{2}$:\n- Remaining states at $M_L = \\pm 1$: $2 - 1 = 1$\n- Remaining states at $M_L = 0$: $2 - 1 = 1$\n- All other $M_L$ counts become $0$.\nThe remaining microstates form a set with $M_L \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This corresponds to a term with $L=1$ (a $P$ term). As it is also found in the $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ manifold, this is a quartet P term, $^4P$.\n\nThus, the possible terms for $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ are $^4F$ (corresponding to $L=3$) and $^4P$ (corresponding to $L=1$).\nThe total number of microstates for these quartet terms is:\n- $^4F$: $(2S+1)(2L+1) = (2(\\frac{3}{2})+1)(2(3)+1) = 4 \\times 7 = 28$ states.\n- $^4P$: $(2S+1)(2L+1) = (2(\\frac{3}{2})+1)(2(1)+1) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$ states.\nTotal quartet states: $28 + 12 = 40$.\n\n**Remaining States ($S=\\frac{1}{2}$)**\nThe remaining $120 - 40 = 80$ microstates must belong to terms with lower spin, which in this case must be doublets ($S=\\frac{1}{2}$, multiplicity $2S+1=2$). To confirm this, we count the states in the $M_S = \\frac{1}{2}$ sector. A state with $M_S=\\frac{1}{2}$ has two electrons with spin up and one with spin down. The number of ways to choose two spin-up orbitals from five is $\\binom{5}{2}=10$. The number of ways to choose one spin-down orbital is $\\binom{5}{1}=5$. Total states are $\\binom{5}{2}\\binom{5}{1} = 10 \\times 5 = 50$.\nThe quartet terms ($^4F$ and $^4P$) contribute states to the $M_S=\\frac{1}{2}$ sector. The $^4F$ term contributes $2L+1=7$ states, and the $^4P$ term contributes $2L+1=3$ states. Total from quartets is $7+3=10$.\nThe number of doublet states in the $M_S=\\frac{1}{2}$ sector is $50 - 10 = 40$. Since for a doublet, half the states have $M_S=\\frac{1}{2}$ and half have $M_S=-\\frac{1}{2}$, the total number of doublet states is $2 \\times 40 = 80$. This confirms our earlier count.\nBy constructing the full table of microstates (a tedious but systematic process), or by more advanced group theoretical methods, the remaining $80$ states can be shown to form the following terms: $^2H$ ($L=5$), $^2G$ ($L=4$), $^2F$ ($L=3$), $^2D$ (which appears twice), and $^2P$ ($L=1$).\n\nSummary of all terms for the $d^3$ configuration:\n- For $S=\\frac{3}{2}$: $L=3, 1$ (giving terms $^4F, ^4P$).\n- For $S=\\frac{1}{2}$: $L=5, 4, 3, 2, 1$ (giving terms $^2H, ^2G, ^2F, 2 \\times ^2D, ^2P$).\n\n**Part 2: Ground State Identification using Hund's Rules**\n\nWe apply Hund's rules to identify the ground state term amongst all possibilities ($^4F, ^4P, ^2H, ^2G, ^2F, 2 \\times ^2D, ^2P$).\n\n1.  **Hund's First Rule (Maximize Spin Multiplicity):** The term with the highest value of total spin $S$ (and thus the highest multiplicity $2S+1$) is lowest in energy.\n    - We have quartet terms ($S=\\frac{3}{2}$, multiplicity $4$) and doublet terms ($S=\\frac{1}{2}$, multiplicity $2$).\n    - The quartet terms are lower in energy than the doublet terms. The ground state must be either $^4F$ or $^4P$.\n\n2.  **Hund's Second Rule (Maximize Orbital Angular Momentum):** For a given spin multiplicity, the term with the highest value of total orbital angular momentum $L$ is lowest in energy.\n    - Comparing the two quartet terms, $^4F$ ($L=3$) and $^4P$ ($L=1$).\n    - Since $3 > 1$, the $^4F$ term has lower energy than the $^4P$ term.\n    - The ground state spectroscopic term is therefore $^4F$. For this term, $S=\\frac{3}{2}$ and $L=3$.\n\n3.  **Hund's Third Rule (Total Angular Momentum):** The final step is to determine the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ for the lowest energy level of the $^4F$ term. The possible values of $J$ are given by the angular momentum addition rule: $J = |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \\dots, L+S$.\n    - For the $^4F$ term, $L=3$ and $S=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n    - The possible $J$ values are: $|3-\\frac{3}{2}|, \\dots, 3+\\frac{3}{2}$, which are $J \\in \\{\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}, \\frac{9}{2}\\}$.\n    - The rule for selecting the ground state $J$ depends on the filling of the subshell. The $d$ subshell can hold $10$ electrons. The $d^3$ configuration is less than half-filled ($3 < 5$).\n    - For a less-than-half-filled subshell, the level with the minimum value of $J$ is lowest in energy.\n    - The minimum $J$ value is $J = |L-S| = |3 - \\frac{3}{2}| = \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe ground state of the $d^3$ ion is therefore the $^4F_{3/2}$ level. The corresponding quantum numbers are $S=\\frac{3}{2}$, $L=3$, and $J=\\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix $(S, L, J)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{2} & 3 & \\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2970428"}, {"introduction": "After determining an ion's ground state quantum numbers $S$, $L$, and $J$, the next step is to predict its magnetic response.

The problem states that Russell-Saunders (RS) coupling is a valid approximation. The solution proceeds in two stages: first, applying Hund's rules to find the quantum numbers of the ground state, and second, using these quantum numbers to calculate $g_J$.\n\nThe ground-state term is denoted by $^{2S+1}L_J$, where $S$ is the total spin quantum number, $L$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number. These quantum numbers are determined by Hund's rules.\n\nThe electron configuration is $4f^7$. For an $f$ subshell, the orbital angular momentum quantum number for a single electron is $l=3$. This subshell has $2l+1 = 2(3)+1 = 7$ orbitals, corresponding to magnetic quantum numbers $m_l \\in \\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Application of Hund's Rules**\n\n**Rule 1: Maximize the total spin S.**\nTo maximize the total spin, we must place the electrons into the available orbitals in such a way that the number of parallel spins is maximized. The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that each orbital can hold at most one electron of a given spin. Since there are $7$ electrons and $7$ orbitals, we can place one electron in each orbital, all with the same spin direction (e.g., spin-up, $m_s = +1/2$).\n\nThe total spin quantum number $S$ is the sum of the individual spin projection quantum numbers:\n$$ S = \\sum_{i=1}^7 m_{s_i} = 7 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{7}{2} $$\nThe spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8$.\n\n**Rule 2: Maximize the total orbital angular momentum L for the given S.**\nWith the spin configuration from Rule 1 (one electron in each orbital), we calculate the total orbital angular momentum. $L$ is the absolute value of the sum of the individual magnetic quantum numbers $m_{l_i}$:\n$$ L = \\left| \\sum_{i=1}^7 m_{l_i} \\right| $$\nThe electrons occupy orbitals with $m_l = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$. The sum is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^7 m_{l_i} = (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 0 $$\nTherefore, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $L=0$. The spectroscopic letter corresponding to $L=0$ is $S$.\n\n**Rule 3: Determine the total angular momentum J.**\nThe total angular momentum quantum number $J$ is determined by the coupling of $L$ and $S$. The possible values of $J$ range from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps.\nWith $L=0$ and $S=7/2$, the only possible value for $J$ is:\n$$ J = |L-S| = \\left|0 - \\frac{7}{2}\\right| = \\frac{7}{2} $$\nAlternatively, Hund's third rule specifies that for a subshell that is less than half-filled, $J = |L-S|$, and for a subshell that is more than half-filled, $J = L+S$. For a subshell that is exactly half-filled, as is the case for $f^7$, we have $L=0$, which implies $J = S$. Here, $J=S=7/2$.\n\nCombining these results, the ground-state term $^{2S+1}L_J$ for the $4f^7$ configuration is $^8S_{7/2}$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of the Landé g-factor ($g_J$)**\n\nThe Landé $g$-factor is a proportionality constant that relates the magnetic moment of an atom to its total angular momentum under the RS coupling scheme. It is given by the formula:\n$$ g_J = 1 + \\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{2J(J+1)} $$\nThis formula is derived by projecting the magnetic moment operator $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = -(\\mu_B/\\hbar)(\\mathbf{L} + 2\\mathbf{S})$ onto the total angular momentum vector $\\mathbf{J}$, assuming the electron orbital and spin $g$-factors are $g_L=1$ and $g_S=2$ respectively.\n\nWe use the quantum numbers for the ground state of $Gd^{3+}$:\n$S = 7/2$\n$L = 0$\n$J = 7/2$\n\nFirst, let's compute the products involving the quantum numbers:\n$$ S(S+1) = \\frac{7}{2}\\left(\\frac{7}{2}+1\\right) = \\frac{7}{2}\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = \\frac{63}{4} $$\n$$ L(L+1) = 0(0+1) = 0 $$\n$$ J(J+1) = \\frac{7}{2}\\left(\\frac{7}{2}+1\\right) = \\frac{7}{2}\\left(\\frac{9}{2}\\right) = \\frac{63}{4} $$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula for $g_J$:\n$$ g_J = 1 + \\frac{\\frac{63}{4} + \\frac{63}{4} - 0}{2\\left(\\frac{63}{4}\\right)} $$\n$$ g_J = 1 + \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{63}{4}\\right)}{2\\left(\\frac{63}{4}\\right)} $$\n$$ g_J = 1 + 1 $$\n$$ g_J = 2 $$\n\nThis result is expected. For any state with zero orbital angular momentum ($L=0$), the total angular momentum is purely from spin ($J=S$). The magnetic properties are determined entirely by the electron spins. In this case, the Landé $g$-factor simply becomes the electron spin $g$-factor, $g_S$, which is approximated as $2$.\nFor $L=0$, the formula for $g_J$ simplifies to:\n$$ g_J = 1 + \\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1)}{2J(J+1)} $$\nSince $L=0$, we have $J=S$, so $J(J+1) = S(S+1)$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ g_J = 1 + \\frac{S(S+1) + S(S+1)}{2S(S+1)} = 1 + \\frac{2S(S+1)}{2S(S+1)} = 1+1=2 $$\nThe Landé $g$-factor for the ground state of a trivalent gadolinium ion is exactly $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2970421"}, {"introduction": "While Hund's rules and the simple spin–orbit coupling model provide a powerful framework, real spectroscopic data often reveal deviations that point to more subtle physics.

The claims can be verified by direct calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe problem concerns the fine structure of a $^{3}F$ term. The spectroscopic notation $^{2S+1}L$ indicates that for this term, the total spin quantum number is $S$ such that $2S+1 = 3 \\implies S=1$. The letter $F$ indicates that the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $L=3$.\n\nIn the Russell-Saunders (LS) coupling scheme, the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ can take values from $|L-S|$ to $L+S$ in integer steps. For $L=3$ and $S=1$, the possible values are $J=2, 3, 4$, which matches the three components observed experimentally.\n\nThe spin-orbit Hamiltonian is given as $H_{\\mathrm{SO}} = \\zeta\\,\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$. Within a given LS term, the first-order energy correction for a specific $J$ level is given by the expectation value of $H_{\\mathrm{SO}}$. Using the relation $\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{S}$, we get $\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{J}^2 - \\mathbf{L}^2 - \\mathbf{S}^2)$. The first-order energy shift relative to the term's center of gravity is:\n$$ E_{J}^{(1)} = \\langle LSJ | \\zeta\\,\\mathbf{L}\\cdot\\mathbf{S} | LSJ \\rangle = \\frac{\\zeta}{2} [J(J+1) - L(L+1) - S(S+1)] $$\nFor the $^{3}F$ term ($L=3, S=1$):\n-   $E_{J=2}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\zeta}{2} [2(3) - 3(4) - 1(2)] = \\frac{\\zeta}{2} [6 - 12 - 2] = -4\\zeta$\n-   $E_{J=3}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\zeta}{2} [3(4) - 3(4) - 1(2)] = \\frac{\\zeta}{2} [12 - 12 - 2] = -\\zeta$\n-   $E_{J=4}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\zeta}{2} [4(5) - 3(4) - 1(2)] = \\frac{\\zeta}{2} [20 - 12 - 2] = +3\\zeta$\n\nThis result leads to the **Landé interval rule**, which states that the energy separation between adjacent levels, $E_J - E_{J-1}$, is proportional to $J$ (the larger of the two $J$ values).\n-   Interval 1: $E_{J=3}^{(1)} - E_{J=2}^{(1)} = (-\\zeta) - (-4\\zeta) = 3\\zeta$\n-   Interval 2: $E_{J=4}^{(1)} - E_{J=3}^{(1)} = (3\\zeta) - (-\\zeta) = 4\\zeta$\nThe predicted ratio of the intervals is $\\frac{4\\zeta}{3\\zeta} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.333$.\n\nNow, we examine the experimental data:\n-   $E(J{=}2) = -400\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n-   $E(J{=}3) = -75\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n-   $E(J{=}4) = +300\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\nThe observed intervals are:\n-   Interval 1: $E(J=3) - E(J=2) = (-75) - (-400) = 325\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\n-   Interval 2: $E(J=4) - E(J=3) = (+300) - (-75) = 375\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$\nThe observed ratio of the intervals is $\\frac{375}{325} = \\frac{15}{13} \\approx 1.154$.\nSince $1.154 \\neq 1.333$, the Landé interval rule is violated. We must find the origin of this deviation.\n\nThe problem states that only crystal-field effects on the *centroids* are negligible, suggesting that intra-atomic effects are the cause. A common cause for such deviations is the mixing of states by the spin-orbit operator, i.e., configuration interaction (CI). The spin-orbit operator $H_{\\mathrm{SO}}$ is a scalar, so it conserves $J$. It can, however, mix states of different $L$ and $S$ as long as they have the same $J$ and parity.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that the $J=2$ and $J=4$ levels are unperturbed, and only the $J=3$ level is shifted. If this is true, the energy separation between the $J=4$ and $J=2$ levels should be consistent with the first-order theory.\n$E(J=4) - E(J=2) = (+300) - (-400) = 700\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nFrom theory, this difference is $E_{J=4}^{(1)} - E_{J=2}^{(1)} = 3\\zeta - (-4\\zeta) = 7\\zeta$.\nEquating the two, we get $7\\zeta = 700\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, which yields a spin-orbit constant of $\\zeta = +100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nUsing this value of $\\zeta$, we can calculate the \"unperturbed\" energies of all three levels:\n-   Unperturbed $E(J=2) = -4\\zeta = -400\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. (Matches observation)\n-   Unperturbed $E(J=3) = -\\zeta = -100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. (Does NOT match observed $E = -75\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$)\n-   Unperturbed $E(J=4) = +3\\zeta = +300\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. (Matches observation)\n\nThis confirms that the $J=2$ and $J=4$ levels behave as expected for a $^{3}F$ term with $\\zeta = +100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, while the $J=3$ level is shifted from its predicted position of $-100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ to the observed position of $-75\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The shift is $\\Delta E = -75 - (-100) = +25\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem reports the observation of a $^{1}F_3$ level. For a $^{1}F$ term, $S=0$ and $L=3$, so the only possible total angular momentum is $J=3$. The spin-orbit Hamiltonian can mix the $^{3}F_3$ and $^{1}F_3$ states because they have the same $J=3$ value (and assumed same parity). The $J=2$ and $J=4$ levels of the $^{3}F$ term are not affected by this particular interaction to first order, as there are no corresponding $J=2$ or $J=4$ levels in the $^{1}F$ term to mix with. This provides a perfect physical explanation for the selective deviation of the $J=3$ level.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The observed deviations are fully consistent with pure Russell–Saunders (LS) coupling and can be absorbed into a redefinition of an effective spin–orbit constant. The appropriate analysis is to fit a single parameter $\\zeta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ to both fine-structure intervals simultaneously.**\nPure LS coupling yields the Landé interval rule. As shown above, the rule is violated. It is impossible to find a single $\\zeta_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ that simultaneously satisfies both intervals: $3\\zeta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 325\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\implies \\zeta_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 108.3\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $4\\zeta_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 375\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\implies \\zeta_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 93.8\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. These values are inconsistent. Therefore, this statement is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**B. The selective displacement of the $J{=}3$ component indicates configuration interaction (CI) via spin–orbit mixing between $^{3}F_{3}$ and a nearby $^{1}F_{3}$ of the same parity...**\nThis option presents the exact physical mechanism identified in our analysis. We now verify the quantitative claims using a two-level perturbation model for the $\\{|^{3}F_3\\rangle, |^{1}F_3\\rangle\\}$ subspace. The Hamiltonian is:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} E_1^{(0)} & V \\\\ V & E_2^{(0)} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $E_1^{(0)} = E^{(0)}(^{3}F_3)$ and $E_2^{(0)} = E^{(0)}(^{1}F_3)$ are the unperturbed energies, and $V = \\langle ^{1}F_3 | H_{\\mathrm{SO}} | ^{3}F_3 \\rangle$ is the off-diagonal matrix element. The eigenvalues of this matrix are the observed energies $E_{\\text{obs}}(J=3) = -75\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $E_{\\text{obs}}(^{1}F_3) = -260\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n(i) From our analysis, $\\zeta = +100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and the unperturbed energy of the $^{3}F_3$ level is $E_1^{(0)} = -\\zeta = -100\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This matches the option.\n(ii) The sum of the eigenvalues equals the sum of the diagonal elements (the trace of the matrix):\n$E_{\\text{obs}}(J=3) + E_{\\text{obs}}(^{1}F_3) = E_1^{(0)} + E_2^{(0)}$\n$(-75) + (-260) = (-100) + E_2^{(0)}$\n$-335 = -100 + E_2^{(0)} \\implies E_2^{(0)} = -235\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nThe unperturbed energy of the $^{1}F_3$ level is $-235\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This matches the option.\nThe unperturbed detuning is $\\Delta_0 = E_1^{(0)} - E_2^{(0)} = (-100) - (-235) = +135\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. This matches the option.\n(iii) The product of the eigenvalues equals the determinant of the matrix:\n$E_{\\text{obs}}(J=3) \\times E_{\\text{obs}}(^{1}F_3) = E_1^{(0)} E_2^{(0)} - V^2$\n$(-75) \\times (-260) = (-100) \\times (-235) - V^2$\n$19500 = 23500 - V^2$\n$V^2 = 23500 - 19500 = 4000$\n$|V| = \\sqrt{4000} = \\sqrt{400 \\times 10} = 20\\sqrt{10} \\approx 63.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nThis matches the claim that $V \\approx 63\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nEvery step of the analysis proposed in this option and all numerical values are correct and consistent with the provided data and fundamental principles.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. The deviations signal dominant $jj$ coupling admixture for the open shell...**\nThis is incorrect. First, the problem is framed in LS coupling. Second, a transition towards $jj$ coupling would affect the entire multiplet, not selectively perturb a single $J$ level while leaving the spacing of other levels in perfect agreement with the LS prediction. Third, the Landé interval rule is a hallmark of LS coupling; the energy level structure in the $jj$ limit is completely different and does not preserve interval ratios.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The deviations are caused by the crystalline electric field...**\nThis option contradicts the premise explicitly stated in the problem: \"crystal-field effects on the centroids of the total angular momentum $\\mathbf{J}$ multiplets can be neglected.\" The analysis should focus on intra-atomic effects, not ion-host interactions that were ruled out.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The deviations most likely originate from two-body terms in the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian... augment $H_{\\mathrm{SO}}$ by adding effective one-parameter corrections proportional to $\\mathbf{L}^{2}$ and $\\mathbf{S}^{2}$...**\nCorrections proportional to $\\mathbf{L}^2$ and $\\mathbf{S}^2$ would evaluate to constants within a given LS term (since $L$ and $S$ are fixed), shifting all $J$ levels by the same amount. This would not alter the intervals between the levels and thus cannot explain a deviation from the Landé *interval* rule. While more complex two-body operators (like spin-spin or spin-other-orbit) can cause deviations, the presence of the $^{1}F_3$ perturber in the data provides a much more direct, simple, and quantitatively verifiable explanation via second-order perturbation theory (configuration interaction), as shown in B. Option B explains *all* the data points, including the position of the second $J=3$ level, which option E ignores.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2970398"}]}
