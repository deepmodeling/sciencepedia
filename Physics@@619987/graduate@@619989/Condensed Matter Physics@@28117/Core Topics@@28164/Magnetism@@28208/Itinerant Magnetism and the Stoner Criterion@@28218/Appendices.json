It uses standard theoretical tools and concepts like Density of States (DOS), Landau energy expansion, magnetic susceptibility, and the Stoner parameter. The use of DFT and the fixed-spin-moment method to parameterize such a model is a common research practice.

Relation between Susceptibility and the Stoner Parameter**\n\nThe Stoner model describes the enhancement of the magnetic susceptibility due to electron-electron interactions. The interacting susceptibility $\\chi$ is related to the non-interacting (Pauli) susceptibility $\\chi_0$ by the Stoner enhancement factor $S$:\n$$ \\chi = \\frac{\\chi_0}{1 - S} $$\nThe non-interacting Pauli susceptibility per formula unit is given by $\\chi_0 = \\mu_B^2 N_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_F)$, where $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_F)$ is the total density of states at the Fermi level for both spin channels. Given the single-spin DOS $N(E_F)$, the total DOS for a paramagnet is $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_F) = 2N(E_F)$.\n$$ \\chi_0 = 2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F) $$\nThe Stoner enhancement factor is defined as $S = I \\cdot N(E_F)$, where $I$ is the Stoner parameter.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\chi$:\n$$ \\chi = \\frac{2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)}{1 - I N(E_F)} $$\n\n**3. Expression for the Stoner Parameter $I$**\n\nBy equating the two expressions derived for the susceptibility $\\chi$, we can solve for $I$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2c_2} = \\frac{2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)}{1 - I N(E_F)} $$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $I$:\n$$ 1 - I N(E_F) = (2c_2) \\left( 2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F) \\right) = 4c_2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F) $$\n$$ I N(E_F) = 1 - 4c_2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F) $$\n$$ I = \\frac{1 - 4c_2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)}{N(E_F)} $$\nThis expression provides the Stoner parameter $I$ in terms of the given quantities $c_2$ and $N(E_F)$.\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe substitute the given values:\n- $c_2 = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{eV}/\\mu_B^2$\n- $N(E_F)=1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}$ (units of states/spin/f.u. are implicit in the definition)\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless term $4c_2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)$:\n$$ 4c_2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F) = 4 \\times (0.025\\,\\mathrm{eV}/\\mu_B^2) \\times \\mu_B^2 \\times (1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}) $$\n$$ = 4 \\times 0.025 \\times 1.50 = 0.1 \\times 1.50 = 0.15 $$\nNow, substitute this value back into the expression for $I$:\n$$ I = \\frac{1 - 0.15}{1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.85}{1.50}\\,\\mathrm{eV} = \\frac{17}{30}\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\n$$ I \\approx 0.5666...\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $I \\approx 0.567\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $I=\\dfrac{1 - \\left[2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)\\right]\\left(2c_2\\right)}{N(E_F)} \\;=\\; 0.567\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\n- The formula is algebraically equivalent to our derived expression:\n  $$ \\frac{1 - [2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)](2c_2)}{N(E_F)} = \\frac{1 - 4c_2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)}{N(E_F)} $$\n- The numerical value, $0.567\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, matches our calculation.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $I=\\dfrac{1 - \\left[2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)\\right]c_2}{N(E_F)} \\;=\\; 0.617\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\n- The formula is algebraically equivalent to $\\frac{1 - 2c_2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)}{N(E_F)}$. This differs from the correct expression by a factor of $2$ in the second term of the numerator.\n- The numerical calculation based on this incorrect formula would be $\\frac{1 - 2(0.025)(1.50)}{1.50} = \\frac{1 - 0.075}{1.50} = \\frac{0.925}{1.50} \\approx 0.617\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The value is consistent with the formula, but the formula is physically incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $I=\\dfrac{1 - \\left[2\\mu_B^2 N_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_F)\\right]\\left(2c_2\\right)}{N_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_F)} \\;=\\; 0.233\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, where $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_F)=3.00\\,\\mathrm{states}/(\\mathrm{eV}\\cdot\\mathrm{f.u.})$ is the two-spin DOS**\n- This formula incorrectly uses the total DOS, $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}(E_F) = 2N(E_F)$, in the definition of the Stoner enhancement factor ($S = I N(E_F)$, not $I N_{tot}(E_F)$) and in the final expression for $I$. The derivation shows that $I$ must be related via the single-spin DOS, $N(E_F)$.\n- The numerical calculation based on this incorrect formula would be $\\frac{1 - 4(0.025)\\mu_B^2 (3.0)}{3.0} = \\frac{1 - 0.3}{3.0} = \\frac{0.7}{3.0} \\approx 0.233\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The value is consistent with the formula, but the formula is physically incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $I=\\dfrac{1 - \\left[2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)\\right]\\left(4c_2\\right)}{N(E_F)} \\;=\\; 0.467\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\n- The formula is algebraically equivalent to $\\frac{1 - 8c_2\\mu_B^2 N(E_F)}{N(E_F)}$. This differs from the correct expression by a factor of $2$ (it has $8$ instead of $4$).\n- The numerical calculation based on this incorrect formula would be $\\frac{1 - 8(0.025)(1.50)}{1.50} = \\frac{1 - 0.3}{1.50} = \\frac{0.7}{1.50} \\approx 0.467\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The value is consistent with the formula, but the formula is physically incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2997262"}]}
