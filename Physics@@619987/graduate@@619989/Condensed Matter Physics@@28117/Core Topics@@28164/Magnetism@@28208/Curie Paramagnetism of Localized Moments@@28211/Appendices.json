The tasks are clearly defined and lead to a unique, verifiable solution. The problem is a standard exercise in condensed matter physics and does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of the Zeeman Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = - g_{J} \\mu_{B} B \\hat{J}_{z}$ are determined by the eigenvalues of the operator $\\hat{J}_{z}$, which are $m$, where $m$ is the magnetic quantum number ranging from $-J$ to $J$ in integer steps. The energy levels are thus given by:\n$$E_{m} = -g_{J} \\mu_{B} B m, \\quad m \\in \\{-J, -J+1, \\dots, J\\}$$\nWithin the canonical ensemble, the partition function $Z$ for a single ion is the sum of Boltzmann factors over all possible states:\n$$Z = \\sum_{m=-J}^{J} \\exp(-\\beta E_{m}) = \\sum_{m=-J}^{J} \\exp(\\beta g_{J} \\mu_{B} B m)$$\nTo simplify this expression, we define the dimensionless variable $x = \\beta g_{J} \\mu_{B} B = \\frac{g_{J} \\mu_{B} B}{k_{B} T}$. The partition function becomes a geometric series:\n$$Z = \\sum_{m=-J}^{J} (\\exp(x))^{m}$$\nThe sum of this geometric series with first term $a = \\exp(-Jx)$, ratio $r = \\exp(x)$, and $2J+1$ terms is:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\exp(-Jx) (\\exp((2J+1)x) - 1)}{\\exp(x) - 1} = \\frac{\\exp((J+1)x) - \\exp(-Jx)}{\\exp(x) - 1}$$\nBy multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(-x/2)$, we can express the result in terms of hyperbolic sine functions:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\exp((J+1/2)x) - \\exp(-(J+1/2)x)}{\\exp(x/2) - \\exp(-x/2)} = \\frac{\\sinh((J+1/2)x)}{\\sinh(x/2)}$$\nThe magnetization of a single ion is the thermal average of its magnetic moment along the field direction, $\\langle \\mu_{z} \\rangle$. The magnetic moment operator is $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}} = g_{J} \\mu_{B} \\hat{\\mathbf{J}}$, so $\\hat{\\mu}_{z} = g_{J} \\mu_{B} \\hat{J}_{z}$. The eigenvalues of $\\hat{\\mu}_{z}$ are $g_{J} \\mu_{B} m$. The thermal average is:\n$$\\langle \\mu_{z} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_{m=-J}^{J} (g_{J} \\mu_{B} m) \\exp(\\beta g_{J} \\mu_{B} B m)$$\nThis can be conveniently expressed as a derivative of the partition function with respect to $x$:\n$$\\langle \\mu_{z} \\rangle = \\frac{g_{J} \\mu_{B}}{Z} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\sum_{m=-J}^{J} \\exp(mx) \\right) = \\frac{g_{J} \\mu_{B}}{Z} \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x} = g_{J} \\mu_{B} \\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial x}$$\nTaking the derivative of $\\ln Z$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ \\ln(\\sinh((J+1/2)x)) - \\ln(\\sinh(x/2)) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial x} = (J+1/2) \\frac{\\cosh((J+1/2)x)}{\\sinh((J+1/2)x)} - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\cosh(x/2)}{\\sinh(x/2)} = (J+1/2)\\coth((J+1/2)x) - \\frac{1}{2}\\coth(x/2)$$\nThus, the magnetization of a single ion is:\n$$\\langle \\mu_{z} \\rangle = g_{J} \\mu_{B} \\left[ \\left(J+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\coth\\left(\\left(J+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)x\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\coth\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\right]$$\nThis expression is equivalent to $g_{J} \\mu_{B} J B_{J}(y)$, where $B_{J}(y)$ is the Brillouin function and its argument is $y = g_{J} \\mu_{B} J B / (k_{B} T)$.\n\nThe crossover from linear response (Curie's law) at weak fields to nonlinear behavior at strong fields is governed by the magnitude of the argument of the Brillouin function. This argument, $y = \\frac{g_{J} \\mu_{B} J B}{k_{B} T}$, is the natural dimensionless parameter as it compares the maximum Zeeman energy of an ion ($g_{J} \\mu_{B} J B$) with the thermal energy ($k_{B} T$). When $y \\ll 1$, the response is linear. When $y \\gg 1$, the magnetization saturates. The crossover occurs when $y \\sim 1$.\n\nThe problem defines the crossover field $B^{*}$ as the field where this dimensionless parameter equals unity:\n$$\\frac{g_{J} \\mu_{B} J B^{*}}{k_{B} T} = 1$$\nSolving for $B^{*}$ gives:\n$$B^{*} = \\frac{k_{B} T}{g_{J} \\mu_{B} J}$$\nWe are given the values: $J = \\frac{9}{2}$, $g_{J} = \\frac{8}{11}$, $T = 4.00~\\mathrm{K}$, $k_{B} = 1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23}~\\mathrm{J/K}$, and $\\mu_{B} = 9.274\\,010\\,0783 \\times 10^{-24}~\\mathrm{J/T}$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$B^{*} = \\frac{(1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23}~\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (4.00~\\mathrm{K})}{(\\frac{8}{11}) \\times (9.274\\,010\\,0783 \\times 10^{-24}~\\mathrm{J/T}) \\times (\\frac{9}{2})}$$\n$$B^{*} = \\frac{5.522596 \\times 10^{-23}~\\mathrm{J}}{(\\frac{72}{22}) \\times (9.27401... \\times 10^{-24}~\\mathrm{J/T})} = \\frac{5.522596 \\times 10^{-23}}{3.035130... \\times 10^{-23}}~\\mathrm{T}$$\n$$B^{*} \\approx 1.81955~\\mathrm{T}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $B^{*} = 1.82~\\mathrm{T}$.\n\nThe physical significance of $B^{*}$ is that it marks the boundary between two distinct physical regimes for a paramagnet at temperature $T$.\n1.  **Linear Response Regime ($B \\ll B^{*}$):** In this regime, the dimensionless parameter $\\frac{g_{J} \\mu_{B} J B}{k_{B} T} \\ll 1$. The thermal energy $k_{B}T$ is much larger than the Zeeman energy that attempts to align the magnetic moments. The orienting effect of the magnetic field is weak, and thermal fluctuations dominate, leading to a small net magnetization that is directly proportional to the applied field. This is the regime where the Curie law, $\\chi \\propto 1/T$, is valid, and the magnetic susceptibility is constant with respect to the field.\n2.  **Nonlinear/Saturation Regime ($B \\gtrsim B^{*}$):** In this regime, $\\frac{g_{J} \\mu_{B} J B}{k_{B} T} \\gtrsim 1$. The Zeeman energy is comparable to or larger than the thermal energy. The magnetic field is strong enough to significantly align the magnetic moments against thermal agitation. The magnetization is no longer proportional to $B$ but increases more slowly, eventually approaching a saturation value as $B \\to \\infty$. Thus, $B^{*}$ quantifies the field strength at which the linear-response approximation (Curie's law) breaks down and the full nonlinear Brillouin function is required to describe the system's magnetization accurately.

Derivation of the Susceptibility Tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\chi}$**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for a single magnetic moment in an external magnetic flux density $\\mathbf{B}$ is the Zeeman Hamiltonian, $H_Z = -\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\cdot \\mathbf{B}$. The magnetic moment operator is given as $\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = -\\mu_B \\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{S}$, where $\\mathbf{g}$ is the diagonal $g$-tensor in the principal-axis frame, $\\mathbf{g} = \\mathrm{diag}(g_x, g_y, g_z)$.\n\nIn the principal-axis frame of a crystallite, the Hamiltonian is:\n$$ H_Z = -(-\\mu_B \\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{S}) \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_B (g_x S_x B_x + g_y S_y B_y + g_z S_z B_z) $$\nwhere $S_i$ and $B_i$ are the components of the spin operator $\\mathbf{S}$ and magnetic flux density $\\mathbf{B}$ along the principal axes $i \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nThe thermal expectation value of the magnetic moment is given by statistical mechanics:\n$$ \\langle \\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\rangle = \\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu} e^{-\\beta H_Z})}{\\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H_Z})} $$\nwhere $\\beta = 1 / (k_B T)$ and the trace is over the $(2S+1)$ spin states.\n\nThe problem specifies the high-temperature and weak-field limit, $k_B T \\gg \\mu_B g_i B_i$, which implies $\\beta H_Z \\ll 1$. We can therefore expand the exponential to first order in $\\beta H_Z$: $e^{-\\beta H_Z} \\approx 1 - \\beta H_Z$.\n\nThe denominator becomes:\n$$ \\mathrm{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H_Z}) \\approx \\mathrm{Tr}(1 - \\beta H_Z) = \\mathrm{Tr}(1) - \\beta \\mathrm{Tr}(H_Z) $$\nThe trace of the identity operator is the dimension of the Hilbert space, $\\mathrm{Tr}(1) = 2S+1$. The trace of any spin component operator is zero, $\\mathrm{Tr}(S_i) = 0$. Consequently, $\\mathrm{Tr}(H_Z) = \\mu_B \\sum_i g_i B_i \\mathrm{Tr}(S_i) = 0$.

For a random distribution of orientations, the average value of $\\cos^2\\theta$ over a sphere is $1/3$. This can be shown by noting that for any orientation, $(\\hat{x} \\cdot \\hat{z}')^2 + (\\hat{y} \\cdot \\hat{z}')^2 + (\\hat{z} \\cdot \\hat{z}')^2 = |\\hat{z}'|^2 = 1$.

By symmetry, all three averages must be equal, so $\\langle (\\hat{i} \\cdot \\hat{z}')^2 \\rangle = 1/3$ for each $i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$.\n\nSubstituting this result:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{powder}} = H \\left( \\chi_{xx} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\chi_{yy} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} + \\chi_{zz} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = \\frac{H}{3} (\\chi_{xx} + \\chi_{yy} + \\chi_{zz}) $$\nThe scalar powder susceptibility is defined by $M_{\\mathrm{powder}} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{powder}} H$.

Justification for Polycrystalline Samples**\n\nA polycrystalline sample consists of a vast number of microscopic single-crystal domains (crystallites) whose principal axes are oriented randomly. When an external field is applied, the macroscopic measurement of magnetization reflects the volume average of the magnetic responses of all these individual crystallites. The powder average calculation correctly models this physical situation by averaging the anisotropic response of a single crystallite over all possible spatial orientations. The result is an effective isotropic susceptibility, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{powder}}$, which describes the bulk magnetic behavior of the sample, as would be measured experimentally. This is why $\\chi_{\\mathrm{powder}} = M/H$ is the appropriate quantity for interpreting measurements on such materials that follow the Curie-Weiss law.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{n \\mu_0 \\mu_B^2 S(S+1)(g_x^2 + g_y^2 + g_z^2)}{9 k_B T}}\n$$", "id": "2980094"}, {"introduction": "An ideal Curie-Weiss plot is a perfectly straight line, but experimental data rarely conforms to this ideal.

The magnetization $M(T,H)$ of non-interacting localized moments in a uniform field $H$ arises from the thermal population of Zeeman-split levels and is defined as the thermal average of the moment along $H$. The magnetic susceptibility is defined as $\\chi(T,H)=\\partial M/\\partial H$ evaluated in the linear-response regime. In practice, Curie fits are often performed by fitting a plot of $1/\\chi$ versus $T$ over a “high-temperature” window.

Select all that apply.\n\nA. Low-temperature isothermal $M(H)$ loops that display a finite remanent magnetization at $H=0$ and a nonzero coercive field are diagnostics for ferromagnetic inclusions; dilute paramagnetic impurities do not produce hysteresis and instead show a reversible, Brillouin-like approach to saturation.\n\nB. Measuring $\\chi(T)$ at multiple fields $H$ and observing a strong decrease of $\\chi$ with increasing $H$ at fixed low $T$ is a signature of saturating paramagnetic impurities; the intrinsic localized-moment response in the linear regime remains independent of $H$ over the same field range.\n\nC. A uniform diamagnetic background from the holder adds a constant negative offset to $\\chi$; if unaccounted for, it merely shifts $\\chi$ and leaves a linear fit of $1/\\chi$ versus $T$ unaffected.\n\nD. Comparing zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization protocols (ZFC/FC) is a diagnostic: a bifurcation at low $T$ with finite field-cooled magnetization is consistent with ferromagnetic or spin-glass inclusions, whereas an intrinsic localized-moment Curie paramagnet shows overlapping ZFC and FC curves in the linear regime.\n\nE. A positive intercept in a high-temperature linear fit of $1/\\chi$ versus $T$ (interpreted as a positive Weiss temperature) is unambiguous evidence of intrinsic ferromagnetic exchange; extrinsic effects such as inclusions or backgrounds cannot produce an apparent positive intercept.\n\nF. At low $T$, comparing the measured $M(H)$ to the Brillouin function expected for the known ionic $J$ and $g$ can reveal excess low-field curvature that saturates by moderate $H$, consistent with a small fraction of impurity spins of larger effective moment; modeling and subtracting such an impurity contribution can recover the intrinsic response and stabilize Curie fits.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed sound.

The concepts involved—Curie paramagnetism, Brillouin function, magnetic susceptibility, ferromagnetic inclusions, paramagnetic impurities, and experimental diagnostics like ZFC/FC—are all scientifically well-established. The problem is well-posed, objective, and free from internal contradictions or scientific flaws.\n\nThe intrinsic behavior of non-interacting localized moments is governed by the magnetization equation,\n$$M(T,H) = N g \\mu_B J B_J(x)$$\nwhere $B_J(x)$ is the Brillouin function and $x = g \\mu_B J H / (k_B T)$. In the linear-response regime (high $T$, low $H$), this simplifies to Curie's Law for magnetic susceptibility, $\\chi = \\lim_{H \\to 0} (\\partial M / \\partial H)$.\n$$\\chi(T) = \\frac{C}{T}$$\nwhere the Curie constant is $C = N (g \\mu_B)^2 J(J+1) / (3 k_B)$. A plot of $1/\\chi$ versus $T$ for this ideal system is a straight line passing through the origin.\nWe will now evaluate each statement based on these principles and the known physics of the extrinsic effects mentioned.\n\n**A. Low-temperature isothermal $M(H)$ loops that display a finite remanent magnetization at $H=0$ and a nonzero coercive field are diagnostics for ferromagnetic inclusions; dilute paramagnetic impurities do not produce hysteresis and instead show a reversible, Brillouin-like approach to saturation.**\n\nA ferromagnetic material below its Curie temperature exhibits magnetic ordering, resulting in a net spontaneous magnetization. The response to an external field $H$ is characterized by hysteresis: the magnetization $M$ depends on the history of the applied field. Sweeping the field up and down traces out a hysteresis loop. Key features include remanent magnetization, $M_r = M(H=0)$, which is the magnetization remaining after the field is removed, and a coercive field, $H_c$, which is the reverse field required to bring the magnetization to zero. These features are definitive signatures of ferromagnetism. Dilute paramagnetic impurities consist of individual, non-interacting magnetic moments. Their alignment with an external field is a thermodynamic equilibrium process, described by the Brillouin function. The magnetization $M(H)$ is a single-valued, nonlinear function of $H$ at a given temperature $T$. It is fully reversible, meaning no hysteresis loop is formed. The magnetization increases with $H$ and eventually approaches a saturation value at high fields or low temperatures. The statement correctly contrasts the hysteretic behavior of ferromagnetic inclusions with the reversible, non-hysteretic behavior of paramagnetic impurities.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Measuring $\\chi(T)$ at multiple fields $H$ and observing a strong decrease of $\\chi$ with increasing $H$ at fixed low $T$ is a signature of saturating paramagnetic impurities; the intrinsic localized-moment response in the linear regime remains independent of $H$ over the same field range.**\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ is rigorously defined in the linear-response limit, i.e., at $H \\to 0$. In this limit, $\\chi$ is independent of $H$. However, in practice, susceptibility is often approximated as $\\chi \\approx M/H$ for a small but finite field $H$. The magnetization of a paramagnet is given by $M(H) \\propto B_J(x)$, where $x \\propto H/T$. As the field $H$ increases, the argument $x$ increases, and the Brillouin function $B_J(x)$ begins to saturate (i.e., its slope decreases). Since $\\chi(T,H) = \\partial M / \\partial H$, a decreasing slope of $M(H)$ directly translates to a decreasing susceptibility. Paramagnetic impurities often have large effective moments, causing them to saturate at lower fields compared to the intrinsic moments of the host material. Therefore, at a fixed low temperature, increasing the measurement field can cause the impurity contribution to saturate, leading to a significant drop in the measured overall susceptibility. If the intrinsic moments have a smaller $gJ$ value, they may remain in their linear response regime ($\\chi_{int}$ is constant) over the same field range where the impurities are already saturating. Thus, a field-dependent measured susceptibility at low temperature is a classic indicator of saturating paramagnetic species.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. A uniform diamagnetic background from the holder adds a constant negative offset to $\\chi$; if unaccounted for, it merely shifts $\\chi$ and leaves a linear fit of $1/\\chi$ versus $T$ unaffected.**\n\nLet the intrinsic susceptibility of the sample follow the Curie law, $\\chi_{int}(T) = C/T$. Let the constant diamagnetic background be $\\chi_0$, where $\\chi_0  0$. The measured susceptibility is the sum:\n$$\\chi_{meas}(T) = \\chi_{int}(T) + \\chi_0 = \\frac{C}{T} + \\chi_0 = \\frac{C + \\chi_0 T}{T}$$\nThe quantity to be plotted is the inverse of the measured susceptibility:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\chi_{meas}(T)} = \\frac{T}{C + \\chi_0 T}$$\nThis function is not linear in $T$. For a function to be linear, its second derivative must be zero. The first derivative is $\\frac{d}{dT}(1/\\chi_{meas}) = C / (C + \\chi_0 T)^2$. The second derivative is $-2 C \\chi_0 / (C + \\chi_0 T)^3$, which is non-zero (unless $\\chi_0=0$). A plot of $1/\\chi_{meas}$ versus $T$ will be a curve, not a straight line. Specifically, for $\\chi_0  0$, the curve will bend downwards relative to the ideal straight line $T/C$. Stating that a linear fit is \"unaffected\" is incorrect. The presence of the background term fundamentally changes the functional form from linear to non-linear. Forcing a linear fit onto this curved data will yield a slope and intercept that are artifacts of the chosen fitting range and do not represent the true intrinsic parameters.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Comparing zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetization protocols (ZFC/FC) is a diagnostic: a bifurcation at low $T$ with finite field-cooled magnetization is consistent with ferromagnetic or spin-glass inclusions, whereas an intrinsic localized-moment Curie paramagnet shows overlapping ZFC and FC curves in the linear regime.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes a standard experimental technique.\n- For an ideal paramagnet, the moments are in thermal equilibrium and respond reversibly to the applied magnetic field at any temperature. The measured magnetization depends only on the current values of $T$ and $H$, not on the thermal or magnetic history. Therefore, the ZFC and FC measurement protocols will yield identical curves: $M_{ZFC}(T) = M_{FC}(T)$.\n- For ferromagnetic materials below their Curie temperature, or for spin glasses below their freezing temperature, the system possesses long-range order or a frozen, frustrated spin configuration. This leads to history dependence. In a ZFC protocol, cooling in zero field results in randomly oriented domains or frozen spins, yielding a low net magnetization. When a field is applied at low $T$, this magnetization increases upon warming as thermal energy helps overcome energy barriers. In an FC protocol, the field applied during cooling aligns the moments/domains, leading to a large magnetization that persists to low temperatures. The divergence between the ZFC and FC curves below a characteristic temperature is a primary signature of such collective, non-equilibrium magnetic phenomena.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. A positive intercept in a high-temperature linear fit of $1/\\chi$ versus $T$ (interpreted as a positive Weiss temperature) is unambiguous evidence of intrinsic ferromagnetic exchange; extrinsic effects such as inclusions or backgrounds cannot produce an apparent positive intercept.**\n\nThis statement claims that an apparent positive Weiss temperature ($\\theta_W  0$) is *unambiguous* proof of intrinsic ferromagnetism. This is a very strong claim. A positive $\\theta_W$ arises from a fit to the Curie-Weiss law, $\\chi = C / (T - \\theta_W)$, which gives $1/\\chi = (T - \\theta_W) / C$. A positive $\\theta_W$ means the linear extrapolation of the $1/\\chi$ vs. $T$ data intercepts the temperature axis at a positive value. While intrinsic ferromagnetic interactions do produce this effect, it is not unambiguous. There are well-known experimental artifacts that can mimic a positive $\\theta_W$. For instance, poor thermal contact between the sample and the thermometer can lead to a systematic temperature lag, where the actual sample temperature $T_{sample}$ is consistently lower than the measured thermometer reading $T_{meas}$, i.e., $T_{sample} = T_{meas} - \\delta T$ with $\\delta T  0$. If the intrinsic behavior is Curie-like, $\\chi = C/T_{sample} = C/(T_{meas} - \\delta T)$. Plotting $1/\\chi$ versus the measured temperature $T_{meas}$ gives $1/\\chi = (T_{meas} - \\delta T)/C$. This is a perfect linear fit with an apparent positive Weiss temperature $\\theta_W = \\delta T  0$, even though no intrinsic interactions are present. The word \"unambiguous\" makes the statement false, as extrinsic effects can indeed produce this signature.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. At low $T$, comparing the measured $M(H)$ to the Brillouin function expected for the known ionic $J$ and $g$ can reveal excess low-field curvature that saturates by moderate $H$, consistent with a small fraction of impurity spins of larger effective moment; modeling and subtracting such an impurity contribution can recover the intrinsic response and stabilize Curie fits.**\n\nThe total measured magnetization is the sum of contributions from the intrinsic moments and the impurity moments: $M_{total}(H) = M_{int}(H) + M_{imp}(H)$. If the impurity spins have a larger effective magnetic moment ($g_{imp}J_{imp}$) than the intrinsic spins ($gJ$), their Brillouin function $B_{J_{imp}}(x_{imp})$ will rise much more steeply at low fields and saturate earlier than the intrinsic contribution's Brillouin function $B_J(x_{int})$. This results in a composite $M_{total}(H)$ curve that shows a sharp initial rise (the \"excess low-field curvature\") followed by a more gradual, quasi-linear increase at higher fields where the impurity contribution is saturated ($M_{imp} \\approx M_{s,imp}$) and only the intrinsic moments are still responding significantly to the increasing field. This specific shape of the $M(H)$ curve is a classic signature of a small amount of a strongly paramagnetic (high-moment) impurity. By fitting the curve to a model that sums two components (e.g., two Brillouin functions, or a Brillouin function for the impurity and a linear term for the host), one can quantify the impurity contribution. Subtracting this modeled impurity part from the total measured data is a standard and valid procedure to isolate the intrinsic magnetic response, which can then be used for a more accurate analysis, such as a Curie-Weiss fit of the corrected susceptibility data.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDF}$$", "id": "2980086"}]}
