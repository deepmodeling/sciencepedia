General Density of States in k-space**\n\nFor a three-dimensional system of volume $V$, the number of allowed wavevector states within a spherical shell in k-space of radius $k$ and thickness $dk$ is given by the volume of this shell multiplied by the density of states in k-space, which is $V/(2\\pi)^3$.

Case 1: Ferromagnetic Magnons (FM)**\n\nThe dispersion relation is $\\epsilon = A k^2$.\nFirst, we express $k$ and $dk$ in terms of $\\epsilon$ and $d\\epsilon$.\nFrom the dispersion relation, $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{A}} = A^{-1/2} \\epsilon^{1/2}$.\nDifferentiating $k$ with respect to $\\epsilon$ gives:\n$$\\frac{dk}{d\\epsilon} = A^{-1/2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\epsilon^{-1/2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2 A^{1/2} \\epsilon^{1/2}}$$\nSo, $dk = \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{A \\epsilon}} d\\epsilon$.\n\nNow we substitute $k$ and $dk$ into the expression for $dN$:\n$$dN = \\frac{V}{2\\pi^2} \\left( A^{-1/2} \\epsilon^{1/2} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2 \\sqrt{A \\epsilon}} d\\epsilon \\right)$$\n$$dN = \\frac{V}{2\\pi^2} \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{A} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{2 A^{1/2} \\epsilon^{1/2}} d\\epsilon \\right) = \\frac{V}{4\\pi^2 A^{3/2}} \\epsilon^{1/2} d\\epsilon$$\nBy definition, $dN = g_{FM}(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon$, so the density of states for the ferromagnetic case is:\n$$g_{FM}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{V}{4\\pi^2 A^{3/2}} \\epsilon^{1/2}$$\nThe internal energy $U_{FM}$ is:\n$$U_{FM} = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\, g_{FM}(\\epsilon) \\, \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\epsilon/k_B T) - 1} \\, d\\epsilon$$\n$$U_{FM} = \\frac{V}{4\\pi^2 A^{3/2}} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\cdot \\epsilon^{1/2} \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\epsilon/k_B T) - 1} \\, d\\epsilon = \\frac{V}{4\\pi^2 A^{3/2}} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^{3/2}}{\\exp(\\epsilon/k_B T) - 1} \\, d\\epsilon$$\nTo find the temperature dependence, we perform a substitution $x = \\epsilon / (k_B T)$.
