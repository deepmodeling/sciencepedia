The spacing between adjacent points is $2\\pi/L$, so the volume in $\\mathbf{k}$-space associated with a single state is $(2\\pi/L)^3 = (2\\pi)^3/V$.\n\nTo find the number of states, we can treat the $\\mathbf{k}$-space as a continuum for a macroscopic volume $V$. The number of states $dN$ within a spherical shell in $\\mathbf{k}$-space between radii $k$ and $k+dk$ is given by the volume of this shell divided by the volume per state.\n$$\ndN = \\frac{4\\pi k^2 dk}{(2\\pi)^3 / V} = \\frac{V}{2\\pi^2} k^2 dk\n$$\nThe density of states in energy, $g(\\epsilon)$, is defined such that $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon$ is the number of states with energy between $\\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon+d\\epsilon$. Since the states counted by $dN$ all have approximately the same energy $\\epsilon(k)$, we can write $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = dN$.

The limits of integration from $k=0$ to $k=\\infty$ correspond to $x=0$ to $x=\\infty$. Substituting these into the integral for $U$:\n$$\nU = n_b \\frac{V\\hbar c}{2\\pi^2} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{\\beta \\hbar c}\\right)^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} \\left(\\frac{dx}{\\beta \\hbar c}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nU = n_b \\frac{V\\hbar c}{2\\pi^2} \\frac{1}{(\\beta \\hbar c)^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} dx\n$$\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function $\\zeta(s)$ and the Gamma function $\\Gamma(s)$:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^{s-1}}{\\exp(x) - 1} dx = \\Gamma(s)\\zeta(s)\n$$\nIn our case, the power of $x$ is $3$, so $s-1=3$, which means $s=4$.\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4)\n$$\nWe know that $\\Gamma(4) = 3! = 6$ and $\\zeta(4) = \\frac{\\pi^4}{90}$. Therefore, the integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{\\exp(x) - 1} dx = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}\n$$\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for $U$:\n$$\nU = n_b \\frac{V\\hbar c}{2\\pi^2} \\frac{1}{(\\beta \\hbar c)^4} \\left(\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}\\right) = n_b \\frac{V \\pi^2}{30 \\hbar^3 c^3 \\beta^4}\n$$\nNow, substitute $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$:\n$$\nU = n_b \\frac{V \\pi^2 (k_B T)^4}{30 (\\hbar c)^3}\n$$\nThe constant-volume specific heat $C(T)$ is the derivative of the internal energy with respect to temperature at constant volume:\n$$\nC(T) = \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T} \\right)_V = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( n_b \\frac{V \\pi^2 k_B^4}{30 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC(T) = n_b \\frac{V \\pi^2 k_B^4}{30 (\\hbar c)^3} (4T^3)\n$$\n$$\nC(T) = n_b \\frac{2\\pi^2 k_B^4 V}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the low-temperature specific heat of antiferromagnetic magnons.\n\nJustification for the similarity with the Debye specific heat of phonons:\nThe temperature dependence of the specific heat, $C(T) \\propto T^3$, is identical in power to the low-temperature Debye specific heat for acoustic phonons. This is not a coincidence but rather a general consequence of the underlying physics of the low-energy excitations in a $3$-dimensional solid. The key shared features are:\n$1$. The excitations are non-interacting (or weakly interacting) bosons.\n$2$. The system is $3$-dimensional.\n$3$. The low-energy excitations have a linear, isotropic dispersion relation, $\\omega \\propto |\\mathbf{k}|$. For antiferromagnetic magnons, $\\omega = c|\\mathbf{k}|$. For acoustic phonons, $\\omega = v_s|\\mathbf{k}|$, where $v_s$ is the speed of sound.\n\nThe mathematical derivation for any such system proceeds identically. The density of states in frequency, $g(\\omega)$, which is the number of modes per unit frequency, is derived from the density of states in $k$-space. For any system in $3$D with $\\omega = v k$ (where $v$ is a constant velocity), the number of modes $N(\\omega)$ up to frequency $\\omega$ is proportional to the volume of a sphere of radius $k = \\omega/v$ in $k$-space: $N(\\omega) \\propto k^3 \\propto \\omega^3$. The density of states is then $g(\\omega) = \\frac{dN(\\omega)}{d\\omega} \\propto \\omega^2$.\nThe internal energy integral takes the form $U \\propto \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\hbar\\omega \\cdot g(\\omega)}{\\exp(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)-1} d\\omega \\propto \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\omega^3}{\\exp(\\beta\\hbar\\omega)-1} d\\omega$.\nThis integral universally yields a $T^4$ dependence for the energy $U$. Consequently, the specific heat $C(T) = (\\partial U / \\partial T)_V$ will always be proportional to $T^3$. The prefactors differ based on the number of bosonic branches ($n_b$ for these magnons; $3$ for phonons) and their respective propagation velocities ($c$ or $v_s$), but the power law is the same. Both antiferromagnetic magnons and acoustic phonons are examples of \"Type-A\" Goldstone bosons, which are characterized by a linear dispersion relation that arises from the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. This distinguishes them from the \"Type-B\" Goldstone boson (the ferromagnetic magnon), which has a quadratic dispersion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n_{b} \\frac{2 \\pi^2 k_{B}^4 V}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3}\n$$", "id": "3021132"}]}
