The analysis is performed at the Brillouin zone boundary $k=k_0=\\frac{\\pi}{a}$, where the free-electron states $|k_0\\rangle$ and $|k_0-G\\rangle$ are degenerate. The unperturbed energy of both states is $E^0_{k_0} = \\frac{\\hbar^2k_0^2}{2m}$.\n\n### Task 1: Construct the effective Hamiltonian\nThe effective Hamiltonian in the degenerate subspace spanned by the basis $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle\\} \\equiv \\{|k_0\\rangle, |k_0-G\\rangle\\}$ is a $2\\times 2$ matrix with elements $H_{ij} = \\langle i|H|j\\rangle$.\nThe matrix elements are:\n$$\nH_{ij} = \\langle i|H_0 + V|j\\rangle = \\langle i|H_0|j\\rangle + \\langle i|V|j\\rangle\n$$\nSince the basis states are eigenstates of $H_0$, we have $\\langle i|H_0|j\\rangle = E^0_{k_0} \\delta_{ij}$.

For diagonalization, we only need the perturbation matrix $W$.\n\n### Task 2: Find the energy splitting $\\Delta E$\nTo find the first-order corrections to the energy, we must find the eigenvalues of the perturbation matrix $W$. The characteristic equation is $\\det(W - \\epsilon I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n-\\epsilon & V_1 \\\\\nV_1 & -\\epsilon\n\\end{vmatrix} = (-\\epsilon)(-\\epsilon) - (V_1)(V_1) = \\epsilon^2 - V_1^2 = 0\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\epsilon_{\\pm} = \\pm V_1$.

We will proceed with a full derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive the effective mass tensor for a Bloch electron, specialize it to the provided tight-binding dispersion on a 2D rectangular lattice, and compute its principal components at the band minimum.\n\nWe begin with the semiclassical equations of motion for a Bloch electron with crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ in a single band with energy dispersion $E(\\mathbf{k})$. The electron is subject to a weak, slowly varying external force $\\mathbf{F}$. The equations are:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{r}} = \\mathbf{v}_g(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E(\\mathbf{k})\n$$\n$$\n\\hbar \\dot{\\mathbf{k}} = \\mathbf{F}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{v}_g$ is the group velocity of the electron wavepacket and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nThe acceleration of the electron is the time derivative of its group velocity, $\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_g}{dt}$.

Substituting this into the expression for acceleration yields:\n$$\na_i = \\sum_{j} \\frac{\\partial v_{gi}}{\\partial k_j} \\frac{F_j}{\\hbar}\n$$\nNow we substitute the definition of the group velocity, $v_{gi} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_i}$:\n$$\na_i = \\sum_{j} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_j} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial k_i} \\right) \\frac{F_j}{\\hbar} = \\sum_{j} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j} \\right) F_j\n$$\nThis equation relates the acceleration of the electron to the applied force.

This inequality signifies that the electron's inertia is direction-dependent. An applied force along the $x$-direction will induce an acceleration corresponding to the mass $m_x^*$, while a force along the $y$-direction will induce an acceleration corresponding to the different mass $m_y^*$. This is the physical meaning of an anisotropic effective mass, which is a direct consequence of the underlying structural and electronic anisotropy of the crystal.

The effective mass tensor, $m_{ij}^{\\ast}$, is defined by analogy with Newton's second law, $a_i = \\sum_j (m^{-1})_{ij} F_j$, where $F_j = -eE_j$ is the force component.\n$$ \\frac{dv_i}{dt} = \\sum_j (m^{\\ast})^{-1}_{ij} F_j = \\sum_j (m^{\\ast})^{-1}_{ij} (-eE_j) $$\nComparing the two expressions for $dv_i/dt$, we identify the inverse effective mass tensor:\n$$ (m^{\\ast})^{-1}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j} $$\nThe term $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j}$ is the Hessian matrix of the dispersion relation, which we denote as $H_{ij}$. Thus, the effective mass tensor $m^{\\ast}$ is given by the inverse of this matrix, scaled by $\\hbar^2$:\n$$ m^{\\ast}_{ij} = \\hbar^2 (H^{-1})_{ij} $$\n\nNow, we apply this formalism to the specific problem. The given dispersion relation for the two-dimensional square lattice is:\n$$ \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = -2 t_x \\cos(k_x a) - 2 t_y \\cos(k_y a) $$\nThe problem asks us to evaluate the effective mass tensor at the point $\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast} = (\\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0)$. First, we verify that this is a stationary point by computing the gradient of $\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_x} = 2 t_x a \\sin(k_x a) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_y} = 2 t_y a \\sin(k_y a) $$\nAt $\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast} = (\\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0)$, the gradient is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_x}\\bigg|_{\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}} = 2 t_x a \\sin(\\pi) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_y}\\bigg|_{\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}} = 2 t_y a \\sin(0) = 0 $$\nSince $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}) = \\mathbf{0}$, the point $\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}$ is indeed a stationary point of the band.\n\nNext, we calculate the Hessian matrix $H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_i \\partial k_j}$. The required second partial derivatives are:\n$$ H_{xx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_x^2} = 2 t_x a^2 \\cos(k_x a) $$\n$$ H_{yy} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_y^2} = 2 t_y a^2 \\cos(k_y a) $$\n$$ H_{xy} = H_{yx} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon}{\\partial k_x \\partial k_y} = 0 $$\nThe Hessian matrix is diagonal for all $\\mathbf{k}$. We evaluate its components at $\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast} = (\\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0)$:\n$$ H_{xx}|_{\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}} = 2 t_x a^2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{a} \\cdot a\\right) = 2 t_x a^2 \\cos(\\pi) = -2 t_x a^2 $$\n$$ H_{yy}|_{\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}} = 2 t_y a^2 \\cos(0 \\cdot a) = 2 t_y a^2 \\cos(0) = 2 t_y a^2 $$\n$$ H_{xy}|_{\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}} = H_{yx}|_{\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}} = 0 $$\nSo, the Hessian matrix at $\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 t_x a^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 t_y a^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues of the Hessian, $-2 t_x a^2$ and $2 t_y a^2$, have opposite signs (since $t_x, t_y > 0$), confirming that $\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}$ is a saddle point, which corresponds to a van Hove singularity in the density of states.\n\nThe inverse effective mass tensor at $\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$ (m^{\\ast})^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} H = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\begin{pmatrix} -2 t_x a^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 t_y a^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the effective mass tensor $m^{\\ast}$, we take the inverse of $(m^{\\ast})^{-1}$:\n$$ m^{\\ast} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} H \\right)^{-1} = \\hbar^2 H^{-1} $$\nSince $H$ is a diagonal matrix, its inverse is the matrix of the reciprocals of its diagonal elements:\n$$ H^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{-2 t_x a^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2 t_y a^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTherefore, the effective mass tensor at $\\mathbf{k}^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$ m^{\\ast} = \\hbar^2 \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2 t_x a^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2 t_y a^2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 t_x a^2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 t_y a^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe Hessian matrix is already diagonal in the $(k_x, k_y)$ basis, so these are the principal axes. The principal components of the effective mass tensor are the eigenvalues of the $m^{\\ast}$ matrix, which are simply its diagonal entries.\nThe principal effective mass along the $x$-direction is:\n$$ m_x^{\\ast} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 t_x a^2} $$\nThe principal effective mass along the $y$-direction is:\n$$ m_y^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 t_y a^2} $$\nThe negative value of $m_x^{\\ast}$ is a characteristic feature of charge carriers near a saddle point of the energy dispersion; it implies that the electron accelerates in the direction opposite to the applied force along that axis.\nThe problem requests the final answer as a row matrix containing the two principal effective masses in the order $(m_x^{\\ast}, m_y^{\\ast})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 t_x a^2} & \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 t_y a^2} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2972723"}]}
