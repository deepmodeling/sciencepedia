This first practice invites you to derive the expression for $m^*$ from semiclassical dynamics within the tractable 1D tight-binding model [@problem_id:2984205]. By calculating $m^*$ at the bottom and top of the band, you will directly confront the physical meaning of a positive (electron-like) versus negative (hole-like) effective mass and its fundamental connection to the band's curvature.", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional (1D) nearest-neighbor tight-binding band with crystal momentum $k$ and lattice constant $a>0$, whose energy dispersion is given by $E(k)=-2t\\cos(ka)$ with hopping parameter $t>0$.

Evaluate $m^{*}$ at the Brillouin-zone center $k=0$ and at the Brillouin-zone edge $k=\\pi/a$. Then, in words, interpret the sign and magnitude differences between these two results in terms of electron-like versus hole-like response.

No numerical evaluation is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the effective mass $m^{*}(k)$ for a one-dimensional tight-binding band, its evaluation at the center and edge of the Brillouin zone, and a physical interpretation of the results. The derivation will proceed from the given semiclassical equations of motion for a Bloch electron.\n\nThe acceleration $a$ of a wavepacket is the time derivative of its group velocity $v$, which is a function of the crystal momentum $k$. Since the external force $F$ causes $k$ to change with time, we must apply the chain rule:\n$$a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{dv(k)}{dk} \\frac{dk}{dt}$$\nThe problem provides two fundamental relations:\n1. The group velocity: $v(k) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{dE}{dk}$\n2. The crystal momentum's equation of motion: $\\hbar \\frac{dk}{dt} = F$, which implies $\\frac{dk}{dt} = \\frac{F}{\\hbar}$.\n\nFirst, let us find an expression for the term $\\frac{dv(k)}{dk}$ by differentiating the group velocity expression with respect to $k$:\n$$\\frac{dv(k)}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{dE}{dk} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}$$\nNow, we substitute this and the expression for $\\frac{dk}{dt}$ into the equation for acceleration:\n$$a = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{F}{\\hbar} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} \\right) F$$\nThis equation relates the acceleration $a$ of the wavepacket to the external force $F$. To define an effective inertial mass $m^*(k)$, we compare this result to Newton's second law, $F = m a$, or equivalently, $a = \\frac{1}{m} F$. By direct comparison, we identify the inverse of the effective mass as:\n$$\\frac{1}{m^*(k)} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}$$\nInverting this expression gives the general formula for the effective mass in one dimension:\n$$m^*(k) = \\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} \\right)^{-1}$$\nThis result confirms that the effective mass is inversely proportional to the curvature of the energy band $E(k)$.\n\nNext, we apply this formula to the given tight-binding dispersion relation, $E(k) = -2t \\cos(ka)$, where $t>0$ and $a>0$. We need to compute the second derivative of $E(k)$ with respect to $k$.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{d}{dk}(-2t \\cos(ka)) = -2t (-\\sin(ka) \\cdot a) = 2ta \\sin(ka)$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{d}{dk}(2ta \\sin(ka)) = 2ta (\\cos(ka) \\cdot a) = 2ta^2 \\cos(ka)$$\nSubstituting this second derivative into our expression for $m^*(k)$, we obtain the effective mass for this specific band:\n$$m^*(k) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2 \\cos(ka)}$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at the two specified points in the first Brillouin zone.\n\n1.  At the Brillouin-zone center, $k=0$:\n    The effective mass is:\n    $$m^*(0) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2 \\cos(0)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2}$$\n    Since $t>0$, $a>0$, and $\\hbar^2 > 0$, the effective mass $m^*(0)$ is positive.\n\n2.  At the Brillouin-zone edge, $k=\\pi/a$:\n    The effective mass is:\n    $$m^*(\\pi/a) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{a} a\\right)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2 \\cos(\\pi)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2(-1)} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2}$$\n    The effective mass $m^*(\\pi/a)$ is negative and has the same magnitude as $m^*(0)$.\n\nThe physical interpretation of these results is as follows. The effective mass relates the particle's acceleration to an external force. A positive effective mass, as found at the band bottom ($k=0$, where $E(0)=-2t$ is the minimum energy), signifies that the particle accelerates in the same direction as the applied force. This is the conventional response we expect from a particle like an electron, and thus this is described as an \"electron-like\" response. The positive value of $m^*(0)$ is a direct consequence of the positive curvature ($\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} > 0$) of the energy band at its minimum.\n\nConversely, a negative effective mass, as found at the band top ($k=\\pi/a$, where $E(\\pi/a)=+2t$ is the maximum energy), signifies that the particle accelerates in the direction opposite to the applied force. This counter-intuitive behavior is characteristic of charge carriers in a nearly-filled band. The absence of an electron (a hole) near the top of a band behaves as a particle with a positive charge and a positive mass. An electron at the top of the band, having a negative effective mass $m^*<0$, responds to an electric field $E_{field}$ (and force $F=-eE_{field}$) by accelerating against the force. The motion of such an electron is equivalent to the motion of a hole with positive charge $+e$ and positive mass $|m^*|$ under the same field. Therefore, the response at the band top is described as \"hole-like\". The negative value of $m^*(\\pi/a)$ stems from the negative curvature ($\\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} < 0$) of the energy band at its maximum. The magnitudes are equal because the curvature of the simple cosine function is equal in magnitude at its minimum and maximum.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2} & -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2ta^2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2984205"}, {"introduction": "While simple models reveal the essence of effective mass, its value in real materials is determined by more intricate physics, specifically the coupling between different energy bands.
