Let this hypervolume be denoted by $\\Omega_{BZ}$.\n\nThe problem statement provides the following key definitions:\n1.  The primitive vectors of the real-space lattice are $\\{\\mathbf{a}_{1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{a}_{d}\\}$, which form the columns of a matrix $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$.\n2.

The defining relationship between the real and reciprocal lattice vectors is $\\mathbf{a}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{j} = 2\\pi\\,\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n5.  The first Brillouin zone is defined as the Wigner–Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice.\n\nA fundamental property of any Bravais lattice, whether in real or reciprocal space, is that its Wigner–Seitz cell is a valid primitive unit cell. This means that the Wigner–Seitz cell tiles the entire space without overlap when translated by all lattice vectors, and its volume is therefore equal to the volume of any other primitive unit cell of that lattice.\n\nBased on this property, the hypervolume of the first Brillouin zone, $\\Omega_{BZ}$, is equal to the hypervolume of the primitive unit cell of the reciprocal lattice. The primitive unit cell of the reciprocal lattice is the $d$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the primitive reciprocal vectors $\\{\\mathbf{b}_{1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{b}_{d}\\}$. The hypervolume of this parallelotope is given by the magnitude of the determinant of the matrix whose columns (or rows) are these vectors. Using the matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ whose columns are the vectors $\\mathbf{b}_j$, this hypervolume is:\n$$ \\Omega_{BZ} = |\\det \\mathbf{B}| $$\nOur task is to relate $|\\det \\mathbf{B}|$ to the given real-space hypervolume $\\Omega = |\\det \\mathbf{A}|$. To do this, we utilize the defining relation $\\mathbf{a}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{j} = 2\\pi\\,\\delta_{ij}$.\n\nLet us express this relation in matrix form. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ has the vectors $\\mathbf{a}_i$ as its columns. The transpose of this matrix, $\\mathbf{A}^T$, therefore has the vectors $\\mathbf{a}_i$ as its rows (more precisely, the components of $\\mathbf{a}_i$ form the $i$-th row of $\\mathbf{A}^T$). The matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ has the vectors $\\mathbf{b}_j$ as its columns.\n\nThe $(i, j)$-th element of the matrix product $\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{B}$ is the dot product of the $i$-th row of $\\mathbf{A}^T$ and the $j$-th column of $\\mathbf{B}$. This corresponds exactly to the dot product $\\mathbf{a}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{j}$.\nTherefore, the defining relation can be written as a single matrix equation:\n$$ \\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{B} = 2\\pi \\mathbf{I} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix.\n\nTo find the relationship between the hypervolumes, we take the determinant of both sides of this equation:\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{B}) = \\det(2\\pi \\mathbf{I}) $$\nUsing the property that the determinant of a product of matrices is the product of their determinants, $\\det(\\mathbf{XY}) = \\det(\\mathbf{X})\\det(\\mathbf{Y})$, the left side becomes:\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}^T) \\det(\\mathbf{B}) $$\nUsing the property that the determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of its transpose, $\\det(\\mathbf{A}^T) = \\det(\\mathbf{A})$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\det(\\mathbf{A}) \\det(\\mathbf{B}) $$\nFor the right side, we use the property that for a scalar $c$ and a $d \\times d$ matrix $\\mathbf{M}$, $\\det(c\\mathbf{M}) = c^d \\det(\\mathbf{M})$.

The set of discrete $\\mathbf{k}$-points forms a grid.

In the thermodynamic limit, this sum can be approximated by a Riemann integral:\n$$ \\sum_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\text{FBZ}} F(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\text{FBZ}} F(\\mathbf{k}) \\frac{\\Delta k}{\\Delta k} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta k} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\text{FBZ}} F(\\mathbf{k}) \\Delta k $$\nThe term $\\sum F(\\mathbf{k}) \\Delta k$ converges to the integral $\\int_{\\text{FBZ}} F(\\mathbf{k}) d^3k$.

A single-particle state is defined by its quantum numbers, which for a crystal are the band index $n$, the crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}$, and the spin quantum number $m_s$. We are considering a single band, so $n$ is fixed.\nThe number of distinct orbital states is the number of allowed, distinct $\\mathbf{k}$-vectors within one primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice (the FBZ). The set of vectors $\\mathbf{k} = \\frac{m_1}{N_1}\\mathbf{b}_1 + \\frac{m_2}{N_2}\\mathbf{b}_2 + \\frac{m_3}{N_3}\\mathbf{b}_3$ covers the FBZ exactly once if the integers $m_i$ range over $N_i$ consecutive values. For example, we can choose $m_1 \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_1-1\\}$, $m_2 \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_2-1\\}$, and $m_3 \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N_3-1\\}$.\nThe total number of unique integer triplets $(m_1, m_2, m_3)$ within these ranges is $N_1 \\times N_2 \\times N_3 = N$. Thus, there are $N$ distinct orbital states (i.e., $N$ distinct allowed $\\mathbf{k}$-points) in the FBZ for the chosen supercell.\n\nThe problem requires counting spin multiplicity. Electrons are spin-$1/2$ particles, so for each orbital state ($\\mathbf{k}$-vector), there are $2s+1 = 2(1/2)+1 = 2$ possible spin states ($m_s = +1/2$ and $m_s = -1/2$). In zero magnetic field, these states are degenerate in energy.\nThe total number of distinct single-particle states is the product of the number of distinct orbital states and the spin degeneracy.\n$$ \\text{Total States} = (\\text{Number of } \\mathbf{k}\\text{-points in FBZ}) \\times (\\text{Spin degeneracy}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total States} = (N_1 N_2 N_3) \\times 2 $$\nThis result can also be confirmed using the sum-to-integral conversion. The number of orbital states is $\\sum_{\\mathbf{k} \\in \\text{FBZ}} 1$. Using the conversion, this becomes $\\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int_{\\text{FBZ}} 1 \\, d^3k = \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\Omega_k$.

The crystal momentum $k(t)$ increases or decreases linearly and indefinitely with time, sweeping sequentially through all Brillouin zones in $k$-space. Since all physical quantities like energy $E(k)$ and group velocity $v_g(k)$ are periodic with the reciprocal lattice period $G=2\\pi/a$, the linear motion in $k$ leads to periodic motion of all observable physical properties, which is the origin of Bloch oscillations.\n\n- **Reduced-zone scheme**: Here, the crystal momentum is mapped back into the first Brillouin zone (e.g., $[-\\pi/a, \\pi/a)$) by subtracting integer multiples of the reciprocal lattice vector $G=2\\pi/a$. As $k(t)$ increases linearly and reaches the boundary at $k=\\pi/a$, it is instantaneously translated by $-G$ to $k=-\\pi/a$ (since $E(\\pi/a) = E(-\\pi/a)$).
