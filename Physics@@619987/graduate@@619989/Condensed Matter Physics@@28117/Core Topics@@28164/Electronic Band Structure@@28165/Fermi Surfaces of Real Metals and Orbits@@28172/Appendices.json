All necessary information is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe starting point is the general tight-binding dispersion relation for a single orbital per site, given by:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{k}) = E_0 + \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} t_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}}\n$$\nwhere $E_0$ is the on-site energy, $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ are the vectors connecting a site to its neighbors included in the hopping model, and $t_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}$ is the hopping integral for a displacement $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n- The on-site energy is $E_0 = 0$.\n- The model includes nearest-neighbor hopping only.\n- The hopping matrix element for all nearest neighbors is constant, $t_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} = -t$, where $t>0$.\n- For a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice with conventional cubic lattice parameter $a$, the set of $8$ nearest-neighbor vectors is $\\boldsymbol{\\delta} = \\frac{a}{2}(\\pm \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\pm \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\pm \\hat{\\mathbf{z}})$.\n\nSubstituting these givens into the dispersion relation yields:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{k}) = 0 + \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} (-t) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}} = -t \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}}\n$$\nLet the wavevector be $\\mathbf{k} = k_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_y \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + k_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The dot product $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ for each of the $8$ vectors is $\\frac{a}{2}(\\pm k_x \\pm k_y \\pm k_z)$. The sum can be written as:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}} = \\sum_{s_x, s_y, s_z \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}} \\exp\\left(i \\frac{a}{2} (s_x k_x + s_y k_y + s_z k_z)\\right)\n$$\nThis sum is separable:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}} = \\left( \\sum_{s_x \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}} e^{i s_x \\frac{ak_x}{2}} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{s_y \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}} e^{i s_y \\frac{ak_y}{2}} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{s_z \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}} e^{i s_z \\frac{ak_z}{2}} \\right)\n$$\nEach term in parentheses is of the form $e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$.

This corresponds to filling states near the bottom of the energy band. The minimum energy occurs when the product of cosines is maximized. This happens at $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$ (the $\\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone), where each cosine term is $1$. The minimum energy is $E(\\mathbf{0}) = -8t$.\n\nTo find the effective-mass approximation, we perform a Taylor expansion of $E(\\mathbf{k})$ for small $|\\mathbf{k}|$.

Therefore, at low filling, the Fermi surface is a small sphere centered at the Brillouin-zone center ($\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$).\n\nNow, we derive the relation between the Fermi energy $E_F$ and the band filling $\\nu$. The number of available electron states (including spin) in a volume $V$ of the solid is given by state-counting in reciprocal space. The density of $\\mathbf{k}$-points in reciprocal space is $\\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3}$. Since each $\\mathbf{k}$-state can accommodate $2$ electrons (spin up and spin down), the total number of electrons $N$ up to a Fermi wavevector $k_F$ is:\n$$\nN = 2 \\times \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\times (\\text{Volume of the Fermi sphere}) = 2 \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3 = \\frac{V}{3\\pi^2}k_F^3\n$$\nThe band filling $\\nu$ is defined as the number of electrons per primitive cell. The total number of primitive cells in volume $V$ is $V/V_{\\text{cell}}$. Thus, the total number of electrons is also given by $N = \\nu \\frac{V}{V_{\\text{cell}}}$. The problem states the BCC primitive cell volume is $V_{\\text{cell}} = a^3/2$.\n$$\nN = \\nu \\frac{V}{a^3/2} = \\frac{2\\nu V}{a^3}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $N$:\n$$\n\\frac{V}{3\\pi^2}k_F^3 = \\frac{2\\nu V}{a^3}\n$$\nThe volume $V$ cancels. We can solve for $k_F^3$:\n$$\nk_F^3 = \\frac{6\\pi^2 \\nu}{a^3}\n$$\nFrom this, we find $k_F^2$:\n$$\nk_F^2 = \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2\\nu}{a^3}\\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{(6\\pi^2\\nu)^{2/3}}{a^2}\n$$\nThe Fermi energy $E_F$ is the energy at the Fermi surface, i.e., $E(k_F)$. Using our quadratic approximation for the energy:\n$$\nE_F \\approx -8t + ta^2 k_F^2\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_F^2$:\n$$\nE_F \\approx -8t + ta^2 \\left(\\frac{(6\\pi^2\\nu)^{2/3}}{a^2}\\right) = -8t + t(6\\pi^2\\nu)^{2/3}\n$$\nThis is the leading-order relation for the Fermi energy $E_F$ as a function of the band filling $\\nu$ in the low-filling limit. It is expressed solely in terms of the hopping parameter $t$ and the filling $\\nu$, as required. The constant term $-8t$ represents the energy of the band bottom, and the term proportional to $\\nu^{2/3}$ describes how the Fermi energy increases from the band bottom as electrons are added.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-8t + t \\left( 6\\pi^2\\nu \\right)^{\\frac{2}{3}}}\n$$", "id": "2989104"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple spherical surfaces, this exercise explores a Fermi surface with a more complex geometry and a critical topological property: nesting.

This property imparts a crucial symmetry to the energy spectrum. Let us define a vector $\\mathbf{Q} = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a, \\pi/a)$, which connects the center of the BZ ($\\Gamma$ point) to a corner ($R$ point).

At half-filling, the number of electrons is exactly half the total number of available single-particle states in the band. The particle-hole symmetry implies that for every state with energy $E(\\mathbf{k})$, there exists a state with energy $-E(\\mathbf{k})$. The density of states $g(E)$ is therefore symmetric about $E=0$, i.e., $g(E)=g(-E)$. To fill exactly half the states, we must fill all states with negative energy and leave all states with positive energy empty. The chemical potential (which at $T=0$ is the Fermi energy $E_F$) must therefore be located at the energy that separates the occupied and unoccupied states. Due to the symmetry of the density of states, this energy is precisely $E_F = 0$.\n\nThe second task is to derive the implicit equation for the Fermi surface. The Fermi surface is the locus of points in $\\mathbf{k}$-space for which the energy is equal to the Fermi energy. Setting $E(\\mathbf{k}) = E_F = 0$:\n$$-2t\\left(\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) + \\cos(k_z a)\\right) = 0$$\nSince $t>0$, this simplifies to the implicit equation for the Fermi surface:\n$$\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) + \\cos(k_z a) = 0$$\n\nThe third task is to establish whether the Fermi surface is perfectly nested and to find a nesting wavevector. A Fermi surface is perfectly nested if there exists a vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ such that for any point $\\mathbf{k}$ on the Fermi surface, the point $\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}$ is also on the Fermi surface.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{k}_{FS}$ be an arbitrary wavevector on the Fermi surface. By definition, $E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS}) = E_F = 0$. We can use the vector $\\mathbf{Q} = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a, \\pi/a)$ that we analyzed earlier. We need to check if the point $\\mathbf{k}_{FS}+\\mathbf{Q}$ also lies on the Fermi surface. The energy at this translated point is:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS})$$\nSince $E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS}) = 0$, it follows that:\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}_{FS}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -0 = 0$$\nThis means that the point $\\mathbf{k}_{FS}+\\mathbf{Q}$ also has energy equal to the Fermi energy and thus lies on the Fermi surface. This property holds for any point $\\mathbf{k}_{FS}$ on the Fermi surface. Therefore, the Fermi surface is perfectly nested.\n\nThe primitive nesting wavevector is the vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ that maps the Fermi surface onto itself.

Construction of the Reduced Brillouin Zone (RBZ)\n\nThe original square lattice has a lattice constant $a$. The primitive lattice vectors can be chosen as $\\mathbf{a}_1 = (a, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}_2 = (0, a)$. The corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors are $\\mathbf{G}_1 = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{G}_2 = (0, \\frac{2\\pi}{a})$. The first Brillouin zone is a square defined by $|k_x| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{a}$ and $|k_y| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\n\nThe CDW with wavevector $\\mathbf{Q} = (\\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0)$ doubles the real-space periodicity along the $x$ direction. The new superlattice has primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}'_1 = 2\\mathbf{a}_1 = (2a, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}'_2 = \\mathbf{a}_2 = (0, a)$.\n\nThe new reciprocal lattice vectors, $\\mathbf{G}'_1$ and $\\mathbf{G}'_2$, are determined by the condition $\\mathbf{a}'_i \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_j = 2\\pi\\delta_{ij}$.\nFrom $\\mathbf{a}'_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_1 = 2\\pi$, we have $(2a) G'_{1x} + (0) G'_{1y} = 2\\pi$, which gives $G'_{1x} = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\nFrom $\\mathbf{a}'_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_1 = 0$, we have $(0) G'_{1x} + (a) G'_{1y} = 0$, which gives $G'_{1y} = 0$.\nThus, the first new reciprocal lattice vector is $\\mathbf{G}'_1 = (\\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0) = \\mathbf{Q}$.\n\nFrom $\\mathbf{a}'_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_2 = 0$, we have $(2a) G'_{2x} + (0) G'_{2y} = 0$, which gives $G'_{2x} = 0$.\nFrom $\\mathbf{a}'_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{G}'_2 = 2\\pi$, we have $(0) G'_{2x} + (a) G'_{2y} = 2\\pi$, which gives $G'_{2y} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$.\nThus, the second new reciprocal lattice vector is $\\mathbf{G}'_2 = (0, \\frac{2\\pi}{a}) = \\mathbf{G}_2$.\n\nThe reduced Brillouin zone (RBZ) is the Wigner-Seitz cell of the new reciprocal lattice. It is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors from the origin to the nearest new reciprocal lattice points. These points are $\\pm\\mathbf{G}'_1 = (\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0)$ and $\\pm\\mathbf{G}'_2 = (0, \\pm\\frac{2\\pi}{a})$.\nThe boundaries are given by the planes $k_x = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{G}'_1| = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$ and $k_y = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{G}'_2| = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{a}$.\nTherefore, the RBZ is a rectangle in $\\mathbf{k}$-space defined by the region $|k_x| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$ and $|k_y| \\le \\frac{\\pi}{a}$. The reduced-zone boundary along the $k_x$ direction is at $k_x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$.\n\n2.  Derivation of the Hamiltonian and Eigenvalues\n\nThe total Hamiltonian is $H = H_0 + V$, where $H_0$ is the unperturbed tight-binding Hamiltonian and $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is the CDW potential. The eigenstates of $H_0$ are Bloch states $|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$ with eigenvalues $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} = -2t[\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)]$. The potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is periodic with the new lattice periodicity, so it can be expanded in a Fourier series over the new reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{G}'$. The dominant Fourier component is specified as $V_{\\mathbf{Q}}$. The potential is approximately $V(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx V_{\\mathbf{Q}} e^{i\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} + V_{\\mathbf{Q}}^* e^{-i\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$, since $V(\\mathbf{r})$ must be real.\n\nThis potential couples Bloch states $|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$ and $|\\mathbf{k}'\\rangle$. A matrix element $\\langle\\mathbf{k}'|V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$ is non-zero only if $\\mathbf{k}'$ and $\\mathbf{k}$ differ by a new reciprocal lattice vector (modulo an original reciprocal lattice vector). The potential component $V_{\\mathbf{Q}}$ couples the state $|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$ to the state $|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle$.\n\nWe construct the effective Hamiltonian in the nearly-degenerate basis $\\{|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle, |\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle\\}$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is restricted to the RBZ. The matrix elements of $H = H_0 + V$ are:\n$H_{11} = \\langle\\mathbf{k}|H_0+V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} + \\langle\\mathbf{k}|V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle$. The average potential $\\langle V \\rangle$ can be set to zero by a shift of the energy origin. So $H_{11} = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$.\n$H_{22} = \\langle\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}|H_0+V|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}$.\n$H_{21} = \\langle\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}|H_0+V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle = \\langle\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}|V|\\mathbf{k}\\rangle = V_{\\mathbf{Q}}$.\n$H_{12} = \\langle\\mathbf{k}|H_0+V|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle = \\langle\\mathbf{k}|V|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}\\rangle = V_{-\\mathbf{Q}} = V_{\\mathbf{Q}}^*$.\n\nThe $2 \\times 2$ Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$ H(\\mathbf{k}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} & V_{\\mathbf{Q}}^* \\\\ V_{\\mathbf{Q}} & \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the eigenvalues, we first evaluate $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} = -2t\\left[\\cos((k_x+\\frac{\\pi}{a})a) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right] = -2t\\left[\\cos(k_x a + \\pi) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right] $$\nUsing the identity $\\cos(\\theta+\\pi) = -\\cos(\\theta)$, we get:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} = -2t\\left[-\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right] $$\nThe eigenvalues $E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k})$ of the Hamiltonian matrix are given by the standard formula:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} + \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}}{2}\\right)^2 + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\nWe compute the sum and difference of the unperturbed energies:\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} + \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} = -2t(\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a)) -2t(-\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a)) = -4t\\cos(k_y a) $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}} = -2t(\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a)) - (-2t(-\\cos(k_x a)+\\cos(k_y a))) = -4t\\cos(k_x a) $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the eigenvalue formula yields:\n$$ E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t\\cos(k_y a) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{-4t\\cos(k_x a)}{2}\\right)^2 + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\n$$ E_{\\pm}(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t\\cos(k_y a) \\pm \\sqrt{4t^2\\cos^2(k_x a) + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\n\n3.  Energy Splitting at the RBZ Boundary\n\nThe energy splitting between the two new bands is $\\Delta E(\\mathbf{k}) = E_{+}(\\mathbf{k}) - E_{-}(\\mathbf{k})$. From the eigenvalue expression:\n$$ \\Delta E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\left(-2t\\cos(k_y a) + \\sqrt{\\dots}\\right) - \\left(-2t\\cos(k_y a) - \\sqrt{\\dots}\\right) = 2\\sqrt{4t^2\\cos^2(k_x a) + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\nThe problem asks for this splitting on the RBZ boundary. The boundary in the $k_x$ direction is at $k_x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$. At these points, the argument of the cosine function is $k_x a = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so $\\cos(k_x a) = \\cos(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$. Note that this is precisely the condition for degeneracy of the original bands, $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}}$, which is necessary for a gap to open.\n\nEvaluating the splitting at the boundary $k_x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$:\n$$ \\Delta E\\left(k_x = \\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2a}, k_y\\right) = 2\\sqrt{4t^2\\cos^2(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} = 2\\sqrt{4t^2(0)^2 + |V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} $$\n$$ \\Delta E = 2\\sqrt{|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|^2} = 2|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}| $$\nThe energy splitting at the RBZ boundary, which corresponds to the CDW gap, is constant along the boundary and equals $2|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|$.\n\n4.  Numerical Calculation\n\nThe problem provides the values $t = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}| = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The energy splitting at the boundary is $\\Delta E = 2|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|$. The value of $t$ is not required for this final calculation, but its magnitude relative to $|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|$ ($0.06 \\ll 0.25$) justifies the weak-coupling approximation used.\nSubstituting the value of $|V_{\\mathbf{Q}}|$:\n$$ \\Delta E = 2 \\times 0.06\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the final answer is $0.120\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.120}$$", "id": "2989078"}]}
