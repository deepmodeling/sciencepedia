## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The principles of momentum-space topology, including Weyl nodes, Fermi arcs, and the [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583), are not merely theoretical constructs. This intricate mathematical structure gives rise to a range of observable phenomena that can be probed in the laboratory. This section explores the experimental methods used to detect these topological features, the unique transport properties that result from them, and the connections between this field and other areas of science and technology. The focus shifts from the foundational principles to their physical consequences and applications.

### Seeing is Believing: Probes of a Topological World

Before we can dream of using a new physical object, we must first be convinced it truly exists. A Fermi arc is not something you can hold in your hand; it is a feature of the collective behavior of electrons on the surface of a crystal. So, how do we make it tangible? The answer lies in spectacular experimental techniques that can map out the "geography" of electron momenta and energies with astonishing precision.

The most direct approach is a technique called Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy, or ARPES. Think of it as a sophisticated way of performing [the photoelectric effect](@article_id:162308). You shine high-energy photons onto the crystal's surface, which knock electrons out. By measuring the kinetic energy and the angle at which each electron emerges, you can work backward to deduce the energy and momentum it had *inside* the crystal just before it was ejected [@problem_id:3024267]. It is, in essence, a camera for electronic band structures.

To hunt for a Fermi arc, an experimentalist would perform a series of carefully designed measurements. First, they must prove the feature is truly a surface state. A bulk state's energy depends on all three components of its momentum, $\boldsymbol{k}=(k_x, k_y, k_z)$, while a surface state is pinned to the 2D surface and its energy should only depend on the two in-plane momenta, say $(k_x, k_y)$. By changing the energy of the incoming photons, an ARPES experiment can probe different values of the perpendicular momentum, $k_z$. A genuine surface state will appear as a feature that does not change its energy dispersion as the photon energy is varied, while the surrounding bulk bands will shift and morph. Once a non-dispersing feature is found, the next step is to trace its path at the Fermi energy. Is it a closed loop, like the Fermi surfaces of ordinary metals? Or is it an open contour—an arc? The definitive proof comes from showing that the endpoints of this arc terminate precisely where the bulk Weyl nodes are projected onto the surface, which can be independently mapped out by the same photon-energy-dependent measurements [@problem_id:3024267].

An even more elegant, though less direct, method involves a clever application of the bulk-boundary correspondence itself. Instead of mapping the whole arc, one can trace a closed loop in the surface Brillouin zone that is known to enclose a single projected Weyl node. By measuring the electronic states along this loop, one can count the net number of chiral modes crossing it—that is, the number of states moving "in" minus the number moving "out." The bulk topology dictates that this count must equal the [topological charge](@article_id:141828) of the enclosed Weyl node. Finding a non-zero count is a smoking-gun signature of the enclosed topological singularity [@problem_id:3024267].

Another powerful tool is the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM), which can map the local density of electronic states on a surface with atomic resolution. When electrons scatter off impurities, they create interference patterns, much like ripples on a pond. The Fourier transform of these patterns, a technique called [quasiparticle interference](@article_id:145809) (QPI) imaging, reveals the allowed "scattering vectors" $\boldsymbol{q}$ that connect initial and final states on the Fermi surface. For a typical metal with a closed Fermi surface, an electron at momentum $\boldsymbol{k}$ can easily scatter to a state at $-\boldsymbol{k}$ (backscattering), leading to a strong QPI signal at $\boldsymbol{q} = 2\boldsymbol{k}$.

A Weyl semimetal's surface tells a different story. The Fermi arc is an open line. For a generic electron on the arc, there simply is *no available state* at the opposite momentum to scatter into. But the story gets even better. Due to the chiral nature of the Weyl fermions, the electron's spin is locked to its momentum. A [backscattering](@article_id:142067) event would require flipping the electron's spin, a process forbidden for non-magnetic impurities. Therefore, the [backscattering](@article_id:142067) channel is suppressed for two independent and profound reasons: one kinematic (the open arc) and one dynamic (the chiral nature of the states). The systematic *absence* of these backscattering signals in a QPI map becomes a powerful, albeit subtle, fingerprint of the open, chiral Fermi arc [@problem_id:3024299].

### The Anomaly in Action: Harnessing Chiral Transport

Observing these features is a triumph, but the real excitement lies in their consequences for how electrons flow. The [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583), which we previously described as a violation of chiral charge conservation, is not just a theoretical curiosity. It leads to a striking and measurable transport signature: [negative longitudinal magnetoresistance](@article_id:146235).

In an ordinary metal, applying a magnetic field usually makes it harder for electrons to flow, increasing the material's [electrical resistance](@article_id:138454). The [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583) predicts the opposite. When the electric field $\boldsymbol{E}$ and magnetic field $\boldsymbol{B}$ are parallel, the anomaly acts like a pump, transferring electrons between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality. This opens up a new, highly efficient conduction channel, causing the resistance to *decrease*. However, experimentally verifying that this [negative magnetoresistance](@article_id:136380) genuinely comes from the [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583) and not from some mundane classical effect is a masterclass in scientific rigor.

A notorious imposter is an artifact known as "current jetting." In a magnetic field, the resistance of a material becomes anisotropic. To minimize dissipation, an injected current will naturally contort itself into a "jet" that follows the path of least resistance. If your voltage probes happen to fall within this jet, you will measure an artificially low [voltage drop](@article_id:266998) and mistakenly conclude the resistance has decreased [@problem_id:3024249]. To expose this fraud, physicists employ a brilliant control experiment. They fabricate the material into a [special geometry](@article_id:194070) called a Corbino disk, where the electric field is always radial, pointing from an inner to an outer contact. By applying a magnetic field perpendicular to the disk, they ensure that $\boldsymbol{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}=0$ everywhere. In this configuration, the [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583) must be turned off completely. If the [negative magnetoresistance](@article_id:136380) vanishes in the Corbino disk but persists in a standard bar-shaped sample (where $\boldsymbol{E}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}$ can be non-zero), we gain tremendous confidence that we are seeing a true [quantum anomaly](@article_id:146086) at work [@problem_id:3024249].

The interplay of surface and bulk gives rise to an even more exotic phenomenon: the "Weyl orbit." Imagine applying a magnetic field perpendicular to a thin slab of a Weyl semimetal. An electron can begin a fantastic journey:
1.  It travels across the top surface along a Fermi arc.
2.  Upon reaching the end of the arc (a projected Weyl node), it enters the bulk, where the magnetic field has quantized the electronic states into Landau levels. The special "zeroth" Landau level is chiral, acting as a one-way street that whisks the electron through the bulk to the bottom surface.
3.  Emerging on the bottom surface, it travels back along the other Fermi arc (which, due to the opposite surface normal, has an opposite velocity).
4.  Finally, it enters the bulk again along the other chiral Landau level (associated with the opposite-chirality Weyl node) and returns to the top surface, completing the orbit [@problem_id:3024300].

This remarkable trajectory, a hybrid of real-space and momentum-space motion, is not just a fantasy. It leads to a concrete prediction. Closed orbits in a magnetic field give rise to [quantum oscillations](@article_id:141861) in the material's resistance, with a frequency proportional to the area enclosed by the orbit. For a Weyl orbit, this enclosed "area" depends on the momentum-space separation of the nodes and, crucially, the real-space thickness of the slab. This gives experimentalists a unique signature to look for: [quantum oscillations](@article_id:141861) with a frequency that scales linearly with the sample thickness. Such an effect can be detected using nonlocal transport measurements, where current is injected in one location and a voltage is measured far away, even on the opposite side of the sample, demonstrating the bizarre connectivity between the two surfaces [@problem_id:3024273].

### From Blueprints to Devices: A Designer's Guide to Topology

The beauty of Weyl semimetals is that their [topological properties](@article_id:154172) are not just static features to be observed; they are characteristics that can be engineered and tuned. The bulk-boundary correspondence is a blueprint, and the experimenter, like an architect, has choices to make.

The Fermi arc's very shape and length, for instance, depend on how you cut the crystal. The arc must connect the projections of the bulk Weyl nodes onto the surface. If the surface is cut such that its normal vector $\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}$ is parallel to the momentum-space [separation vector](@article_id:267974) $\boldsymbol{b}$ between the nodes, the two nodes project to the same point. The arc has nowhere to go; its endpoints merge, and it is no longer topologically protected. If, on the other hand, the surface is cut perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{b}$, the nodes are projected as far apart as possible, allowing for the longest possible Fermi arc. Any angle in between gives a predictable [arc length](@article_id:142701) [@problem_id:3024270]. This gives us a design principle: we can control the surface phenomena by our choice of surface orientation.

Nature also provides a richer palette than our [minimal model](@article_id:268036). Some materials can host "multi-Weyl" nodes, which act as monopoles of higher [topological charge](@article_id:141828), say $|\chi|=2$. Just as a charge-2 electric monopole would have twice the [electric flux](@article_id:265555) of a charge-1 monopole, a double-Weyl node must be a source or sink for twice the Berry curvature flux. The direct consequence on the surface is the emergence of *two* Fermi arcs, both connecting the projections of the opposite-[chirality](@article_id:143611) nodes [@problem_id:3024287].

Furthermore, Weyl nodes themselves come in two flavors. In Type-I nodes, the electronic dispersion forms a standard point-like cone. In Type-II nodes, this cone is tilted so severely that a Fermi surface exists even at the nodal energy. This tilt has a dramatic effect on the [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583). Landau levels, the prerequisite for the anomaly, can only form if the [cyclotron](@article_id:154447) orbits of electrons are closed. In a Type-II material, this is not always the case. It turns out that for a given tilt vector $\boldsymbol{w}$, well-defined Landau levels only form if the magnetic field $\boldsymbol{B}$ is oriented within a certain critical cone around the tilt direction. Outside this cone, the [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583) is completely switched off [@problem_id:3024269]. This directional dependence provides yet another knob for controlling these quantum phenomena.

Finally, we must acknowledge that real materials are never perfect. They are "doped," meaning the chemical potential is not exactly at the nodal energy, and electrons interact with each other. A finite chemical potential transforms the Fermi surface: the arc no longer connects mere points, but now serves as a bridge between finite-sized pockets of bulk electrons or holes [@problem_id:3024281]. And what about interactions? This is where the story connects to the vast field of [many-body physics](@article_id:144032). In a hydrodynamic picture, we can ask how the collective fluid of electrons behaves. The topological nature of the anomaly coefficient protects it from being changed by electron-electron interactions. However, other properties, like the material's [compressibility](@article_id:144065) or its diffusion constants, are renormalized. The interplay between robust topology and renormalizable interactions gives rise to new, fascinating [collective modes](@article_id:136635) of charge, such as the "chiral magnetic wave," where fluctuations in vector and axial charge densities propagate together as a wave [@problem_id:3024268].

From photographing band structures to designing [quantum transport](@article_id:138438) experiments and contemplating new [collective states](@article_id:168103) of matter, the applications of Weyl [semimetals](@article_id:151783) are as diverse as they are profound. They represent a new frontier in condensed matter physics, where the abstract beauty of topology finds its voice in the concrete and measurable reality of the laboratory.
