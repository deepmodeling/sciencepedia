All provided information is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. The problem is valid and admits a unique, meaningful solution.\n\n(i) Equivalence of quasiparticle excitations and the number of anyon types.\n\nQuasiparticles in this theory are labeled by integer vectors $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. An excitation is considered \"local\" if it has trivial braiding statistics with all other quasiparticles in the theory. Such an excitation can be created by a local operator and corresponds to a fundamental boson of the system, which can be added or removed without changing the topological properties of the state.\n\nThe mutual statistical angle between two quasiparticles, labeled by integer vectors $l_{1}$ and $l_{2}$, is given by $\\theta_{12} = 2\\pi l_{1}^{T} K^{-1} l_{2}$. We will derive this result in part (iii). An excitation labeled by a vector $l_{0}$ is local if its mutual statistical angle with any arbitrary excitation $l$ is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. That is, $\\theta_{l_{0}, l} = 2\\pi l_{0}^{T} K^{-1} l \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2\\pi}$ for all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. This condition implies that $l_{0}^{T} K^{-1} l$ must be an integer for all integer vectors $l$.\nLet $v^{T} = l_{0}^{T} K^{-1}$. For this condition to hold for all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, each component of the vector $v$ must be an integer. For instance, choosing $l = (1, 0)^{T}$ requires $v_{1}$ to be an integer, and choosing $l = (0, 1)^{T}$ requires $v_{2}$ to be an integer. Thus, $v$ must be an integer vector, which we denote by $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\nSo we have $m^{T} = l_{0}^{T} K^{-1}$, or, taking the transpose, $m = (K^{-1})^{T} l_{0}$. Since $K$ is symmetric, $K^{-1}$ is also symmetric, so $m = K^{-1} l_{0}$. This implies that the vectors $l_{0}$ corresponding to local excitations are of the form $l_{0} = K m$ for some integer vector $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\n\nTwo quasiparticle labels $l$ and $l'$ are considered equivalent if they differ by a local excitation. This establishes the equivalence relation $l \\sim l'$ if $l' - l = K m$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$. This means that $l$ and $l'$ belong to the same equivalence class in the quotient group $\\mathbb{Z}^{2} / \\text{Im}(K)$, where $\\text{Im}(K)$ is the lattice generated by the columns of the matrix $K$.\nThe number of inequivalent anyon types is the number of such equivalence classes, which is the order of this quotient group. For an integer matrix $K$, this is given by the index of the sublattice $\\text{Im}(K)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, which is equal to the absolute value of the determinant of $K$.\nNumber of anyon types = $|\\det(K)|$.\n\nThe problem states these local excitations are \"electromagnetically integer-charged\". We can verify this. The charge of an excitation $l_0 = Km$ is $Q_{l_0} = e q^T K^{-1} l_0 = e q^T K^{-1} (Km) = e q^T m$. Since both $q$ and $m$ are integer vectors, their inner product $q^T m$ is an integer. Thus, $Q_{l_0}$ is an integer multiple of the elementary charge $e$.\n\n(ii) Electric charge of a quasiparticle.\n\nThe electromagnetic current $J_{EM}^{\\mu}$ is found by taking the functional derivative of the action $S$ with respect to the electromagnetic gauge field $A_{\\mu}$:\n$$\nJ_{EM}^{\\mu} = \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta A_{\\mu}} = \\frac{e}{2\\pi} \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} q_{I} \\partial_{\\nu} a_{I\\rho}.\n$$\nThe total electric charge $Q_{l}$ of a quasiparticle is the spatial integral of the time component of this current, $J_{EM}^{0}$:\n$$\nQ_{l} = \\int \\mathrm{d}^{2}x\\, J_{EM}^{0} = \\int \\mathrm{d}^{2}x\\, \\frac{e}{2\\pi} \\epsilon^{0ij} q_{I} \\partial_{i} a_{Ij} = \\frac{e}{2\\pi} q_{I} \\int (\\nabla \\times \\vec{a}_{I})_{z} \\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}x.\n$$\nThe integral $\\Phi_{I} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int (\\nabla \\times \\vec{a}_{I})_{z} \\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}x$ is the total flux of the internal gauge field $a_{I\\mu}$. To find this flux, we examine the equations of motion for the $a_{I\\mu}$ fields, obtained by varying the action with respect to $a_{I\\mu}$. In the presence of a static quasiparticle source $l$ at the origin, the source term is $j_{I, \\text{source}}^{\\mu} = l_I \\delta^{\\mu 0} \\delta^{(2)}(\\vec{x})$. The equation of motion for $\\mu=0$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\epsilon^{0\\nu\\rho} K_{IJ} \\partial_{\\nu} a_{J\\rho} = j_{I, \\text{source}}^{0} = l_{I} \\delta^{(2)}(\\vec{x}).\n$$\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\epsilon^{ij} K_{IJ} \\partial_{i} a_{Jj} = l_{I} \\delta^{(2)}(\\vec{x})$. Integrating over all space $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int K_{IJ} (\\nabla \\times \\vec{a}_{J})_{z} \\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}x = \\int l_{I} \\delta^{(2)}(\\vec{x}) \\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}x \\implies K_{IJ} \\Phi_{J} = l_{I}.\n$$\nIn matrix notation, this is $K \\vec{\\Phi} = l$, where $\\vec{\\Phi}$ is the vector of fluxes $(\\Phi_{1}, \\Phi_{2})^{T}$. Solving for the flux vector gives $\\vec{\\Phi} = K^{-1} l$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for charge:\n$$\nQ_{l} = e q_{I} \\Phi_{I} = e q_{I} (K^{-1})_{IJ} l_{J}.\n$$\nIn matrix notation, the expression for the charge is:\n$$\nQ_{l} = e q^{T} K^{-1} l.\n$$\n\n(iii) Mutual braiding phase.\n\nThe braiding statistics are determined by the Aharonov-Bohm phase acquired when one quasiparticle is adiabatically transported around another. Consider a quasiparticle labeled by $l_{1}$ moving along a closed loop $C$ encircling a static quasiparticle labeled by $l_{2}$. The phase acquired is $\\exp(i \\phi)$, where $\\phi = \\oint_{C} l_{1I} a_{I\\mu} \\mathrm{d}x^{\\mu}$. Here, $a_{I\\mu}$ is the gauge field sourced by the quasiparticle $l_{2}$.\nUsing Stokes' theorem, the line integral can be converted to a surface integral over the area $S$ enclosed by the loop $C$:\n$$\n\\phi = l_{1I} \\int_{S} (\\nabla \\times \\vec{a}_{I})_{z} \\,\\mathrm{d}^{2}x = l_{1I} (2\\pi \\Phi_{I}),\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi_{I}$ is the total flux of the field $a_{I}$ sourced by $l_{2}$, as calculated in part (ii). The flux vector is $\\vec{\\Phi} = K^{-1} l_{2}$.\nSubstituting this, the phase angle is:\n$$\n\\phi = 2\\pi l_{1I} (K^{-1})_{IJ} l_{2J} = 2\\pi l_{1}^{T} K^{-1} l_{2}.\n$$\nThe mutual braiding phase is $\\exp(i\\theta_{12})$, where the mutual statistics angle $\\theta_{12}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\theta_{12} = 2\\pi l_{1}^{T} K^{-1} l_{2}.\n$$\nThe angle is defined modulo $2\\pi$.\n\nApplication to specific data:\nGiven $K=\\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $q=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe number of inequivalent anyon types is $|\\det(K)| = |3 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 1| = |6 - 1| = 5$.\nThe problem provides a set of $5$ candidate representatives $l_{k} = \\begin{pmatrix} k \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ for $k=0,1,2,3,4$. Two vectors $l_{a}$ and $l_{b}$ from this set are equivalent if their difference $l_{a} - l_{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} a-b \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ can be written as $K m$ for some integer vector $m = \\begin{pmatrix} m_{1} \\\\ m_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} a-b \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} m_{1} \\\\ m_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3m_{1}+m_{2} \\\\ m_{1}+2m_{2} \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe second component equation gives $m_{1} + 2m_{2} = 0$, which implies $m_{1} = -2m_{2}$. For $m_{1}, m_{2}$ to be integers, $m_{2}$ can be any integer. Substituting into the first component equation: $a-b = 3(-2m_{2}) + m_{2} = -5m_{2}$. This means that $l_a$ and $l_b$ are equivalent if and only if $a-b$ is a multiple of $5$. For the given set of representatives where $a, b \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ and $a \\neq b$, the difference $a-b$ is never a non-zero multiple of $5$. Therefore, the given $5$ vectors are all inequivalent and form a complete set of representatives.\n\nTo compute charges and statistics, we first find $K^{-1}$:\n$$\nK^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(K)} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe charges $Q_{l_k}$ are calculated using $Q_{l}/e = q^{T} K^{-1} l$.\n$$\n\\frac{Q_{l_k}}{e} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} k \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} k \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{2k}{5}.\n$$\nThe charges, in units of $e$ and taken modulo $1$ to lie in $[0,1)$, are:\nFor $k=0$: $Q_{l_0}/e = 0$.\nFor $k=1$: $Q_{l_1}/e = 2/5$.\nFor $k=2$: $Q_{l_2}/e = 4/5$.\nFor $k=3$: $Q_{l_3}/e = 6/5 \\equiv 1/5 \\pmod{1}$.\nFor $k=4$: $Q_{l_4}/e = 8/5 \\equiv 3/5 \\pmod{1}$.\nThe set of fractional charges is $\\{0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5\\}$ in units of $e$.\n\nFinally, we compute the mutual statistics angle $\\theta_{12}$ between $l_{1}=\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ and $l_{2}=\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\theta_{12} = 2\\pi l_{1}^{T} K^{-1} l_{2} = 2\\pi \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{12} = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} (2 \\cdot 0 + (-1) \\cdot 1) = -\\frac{2\\pi}{5}.\n$$\nThis angle is on the principal branch $(-\\pi, \\pi]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{2\\pi}{5}}$$", "id": "2990907"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical predictions of anyonic statistics must ultimately connect to experimental observation.

The phase acquired by a quasiparticle of type $l_a$ upon fully encircling (braiding around) a quasiparticle of type $l_b$ is given by $2\\pi l_a^T K^{-1} l_b$.\nThe total statistical phase is the sum of the contributions from encircling each of the $N$ localized quasiparticles:\n$$ \\varphi_{\\mathrm{stat}} = N \\left( 2\\pi \\, l_{\\mathrm{i}}^T K^{-1} l_{\\mathrm{e}} \\right) $$\nWe compute the mutual statistics term $l_{\\mathrm{i}}^T K^{-1} l_{\\mathrm{e}}$:\n$$ l_{\\mathrm{i}}^T K^{-1} l_{\\mathrm{e}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & -2 \\\\ -2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ l_{\\mathrm{i}}^T K^{-1} l_{\\mathrm{e}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{5} \\left( (1)(-2) + (0)(3) \\right) = -\\frac{2}{5} $$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $\\varphi_{\\mathrm{stat}}$:\n$$ \\varphi_{\\mathrm{stat}} = N \\left( 2\\pi \\left( -\\frac{2}{5} \\right) \\right) = -\\frac{4\\pi N}{5} $$\n\nFinally, the total phase shift $\\varphi_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the sum of the Aharonov-Bohm and statistical phases:\n$$ \\varphi_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\varphi_{\\mathrm{AB}} + \\varphi_{\\mathrm{stat}} = \\frac{2\\pi e B A}{5h} - \\frac{4\\pi N}{5} $$\nThis expression can be conveniently factored to yield the final result:\n$$ \\varphi_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\left( \\frac{eBA}{h} - 2N \\right) $$\nThis is the total phase shift of the interference signal as a function of the magnetic field $B$, the interferometer area $A$, and the number of enclosed quasiparticles $N$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\left( \\frac{eBA}{h} - 2N \\right)} $$", "id": "2990914"}]}
