The concepts of space groups ($p4mm$), point groups ($C_{4v}$), Brillouin zones, high-symmetry points ($\\Gamma$, $M$), little groups, and irreducible representations are fundamental to condensed matter physics.

The questions are precise and lead to a unique, determinable solution using standard group-theoretical methods.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using formal, objective language devoid of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Part 1: Determination of the Little Groups\nThe little group $G_{\\mathbf{k}}$ at a wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ is the subgroup of the space group $G$ containing all space group operations $g=\\{R|\\mathbf{v}\\}$ (where $R$ is a point group operation and $\\mathbf{v}$ is a translation) that leave $\\mathbf{k}$ invariant up to a reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{K}$. The condition is $R\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{k} + \\mathbf{K}$. The set of all such rotational parts $R$ forms the point group of the little group, denoted as $G_{0,\\mathbf{k}}$. The reciprocal lattice is generated by vectors $\\mathbf{K}_{n,m} = n(2\\pi,0) + m(0,2\\pi)$ for integers $n, m$.\n\n- **At the $\\Gamma$ point, $\\mathbf{k}_{\\Gamma} = (0,0)$**:\nFor any point group operation $R \\in C_{4v}$, its action on $\\mathbf{k}_{\\Gamma}$ is $R\\mathbf{k}_{\\Gamma} = R(0,0) = (0,0) = \\mathbf{k}_{\\Gamma}$. This is invariant with $\\mathbf{K}=0$. Therefore, every element of the crystal's point group $C_{4v}$ is in the little point group at $\\Gamma$.\nThus, the little point group at $\\Gamma$ is the full point group: $G_{0,\\Gamma} = C_{4v}$.\n\n- **At the $M$ point, $\\mathbf{k}_{M} = (\\pi,\\pi)$**:\nWe must check which operations $R \\in C_{4v}$ leave $\\mathbf{k}_{M}$ invariant up to a reciprocal lattice vector. The generators of $C_{4v}$ are $C_4$ (rotation by $\\pi/2$) and a vertical mirror $\\sigma_v$ (e.g., reflection across the y-axis, $x \\to -x$).\n1.  Action of $C_4$ (counter-clockwise rotation): The matrix for $C_4$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $$C_4 \\mathbf{k}_M = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\pi \\\\ \\pi \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\pi \\\\ \\pi \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    We check if $(-\\pi, \\pi)$ is equivalent to $(\\pi,\\pi)$.\n    $$(-\\pi, \\pi) = (\\pi, \\pi) + \\mathbf{K} \\implies \\mathbf{K} = (-2\\pi, 0)$$\n    This is a valid reciprocal lattice vector for $n=-1, m=0$. So, $C_4 \\in G_{0,M}$. Since $C_4$ is in the group, so are its powers $C_2=C_4^2$ and $C_4^3$.\n2.  Action of $\\sigma_v$ (reflection $x \\to -x$): The matrix for $\\sigma_v$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $$\\sigma_v \\mathbf{k}_M = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\pi \\\\ \\pi \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\pi \\\\ \\pi \\end{pmatrix}$$\n    This is the same result as for $C_4$, and is equivalent to $\\mathbf{k}_M$. So, $\\sigma_v \\in G_{0,M}$.\nSince the generators $C_4$ and $\\sigma_v$ are in $G_{0,M}$, all elements of the group they generate, which is $C_{4v}$, are also in $G_{0,M}$.\nThus, the little point group at $M$ is also the full point group: $G_{0,M} = C_{4v}$.\n\n### Part 2: Allowed Irreducible Representations\nFor spinless electrons, the electronic wavefunctions at a given $\\mathbf{k}$-point must transform according to a single-valued irreducible representation of the little point group $G_{0,\\mathbf{k}}$. Since the little point group at both $\\Gamma$ and $M$ is $C_{4v}$, the allowed irreps at these momenta are the single-valued irreps of $C_{4v}$. The point group $C_{4v}$ has five such irreps: four one-dimensional irreps denoted $A_1$, $A_2$, $B_1$, $B_2$, and one two-dimensional irrep denoted $E$. No further constraints are given, so all are possible.\n\n### Part 3: Character of the $C_4$ Element\nThe character $\\chi(g)$ of a group element $g$ in a given representation is the trace of its representation matrix, $\\chi(g) = \\text{Tr}[D(g)]$. We determine the character of the $C_4$ element for each of the five irreps of $C_{4v}$ by considering the transformation properties of their standard basis functions under a $\\pi/2$ rotation. Let the rotation map $(x,y) \\to (-y,x)$.\n\n- **$A_1$ (trivial irrep):** This irrep is totally symmetric. Its basis can be taken as a constant, $f(x,y)=1$, or an $s$-orbital like function. A rotation leaves it invariant: $D(C_4)f = 1 \\cdot f$. The representation matrix is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $(1)$.\n$$\\chi_{A_1}(C_4) = 1$$\n\n- **$A_2$:** This irrep is symmetric under proper rotations but must be antisymmetric under vertical mirror planes to be distinct from $A_1$. Its basis transforms like an axial vector along the rotation axis, e.g., $L_z \\propto xp_y - yp_x$, which describes infinitesimal rotations in the $xy$-plane. An in-plane rotation $C_4$ a finite amount does not change the sense of rotation about the $z$-axis. Thus, the basis function is invariant under $C_4$: $D(C_4)f = 1 \\cdot f$.\n$$\\chi_{A_2}(C_4) = 1$$\n\n- **$B_1$:** This irrep is antisymmetric with respect to the principal rotation $C_4$. A standard basis function is $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$. Applying the $C_4$ transformation $(x,y) \\to (-y,x)$:\n$$f(-y,x) = (-y)^2 - (x)^2 = y^2 - x^2 = -(x^2 - y^2) = -1 \\cdot f(x,y)$$\nThe representation matrix is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $(-1)$.\n$$\\chi_{B_1}(C_4) = -1$$\n\n- **$B_2$:** This irrep is also antisymmetric with respect to $C_4$, but has different mirror symmetries than $B_1$. A standard basis function is $f(x,y) = xy$. Applying the $C_4$ transformation:\n$$f(-y,x) = (-y)(x) = -xy = -1 \\cdot f(x,y)$$\nThe representation matrix is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $(-1)$.\n$$\\chi_{B_2}(C_4) = -1$$\n\n- **$E$ (two-dimensional irrep):** This irrep transforms as a vector in the plane, with basis $(x,y)$. The transformation $(x,y) \\to (-y,x)$ can be written in matrix form:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe representation matrix is $D(C_4) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The character is its trace.\n$$\\chi_E(C_4) = \\text{Tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0 + 0 = 0$$\n\nThe characters of the $C_4$ rotation for the irreps $(A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2, E)$ are therefore $(1, 1, -1, -1, 0)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2979769"}, {"introduction": "The Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes (BBH) model is the quintessential example of a higher-order topological insulator, hosting robust zero-energy corner states.

The occupied subspace consists of the two bands with negative energy $E=-\\lambda_x$.\n\n**1. First Wilson loop spectrum along $k_x$**\n\nThe Wilson loop along the $k_x$ direction, $W_x(k_y)$, is an operator acting on the two-dimensional occupied subspace. Its eigenvalues are of the form $\\exp(i\\theta_n)$, where $\\theta_n$ are the Wilson loop eigenphases, which correspond to the Berry phases of the hybrid Wannier states.\n\nTo simplify the problem, we can block-diagonalize the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian involves matrices acting on two different spin-$1/2$ spaces (spanned by $\\tau$ and $\\sigma$ matrices). Let's choose a basis that diagonalizes $\\sigma_x$, which is acted upon by $\\Gamma_3$. Let $S$ be the unitary matrix such that $S\\sigma_x S^\\dagger = \\sigma_z$. We apply the transformation $U=I_\\tau \\otimes S$ to the Hamiltonian, obtaining $\\tilde{H} = U H U^\\dagger$:\n$$\n\\tilde{H}(k_x) = \\lambda_x\\cos k_x (\\tau_x\\otimes\\sigma_0) + \\lambda_x\\sin k_x (\\tau_z\\otimes\\sigma_z)\n$$\nIn the standard basis where $\\tau_z$ and $\\sigma_z$ are diagonal, this Hamiltonian decouples into two independent $2 \\times 2$ blocks. After a suitable permutation of basis vectors, these blocks can be written as:\n$$\nh_1(k_x) = \\lambda_x(\\cos k_x \\sigma_x + \\sin k_x \\sigma_z)\n$$\n$$\nh_2(k_x) = \\lambda_x(\\cos k_x \\sigma_x - \\sin k_x \\sigma_z)\n$$\nThese are two copies of a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like Hamiltonian. The total occupied subspace is spanned by the negative-energy eigenstates of $h_1(k_x)$ and $h_2(k_x)$. The Berry phase for each of these states, integrated over the $k_x$ cycle from $0$ to $2\\pi$, will give the Wilson loop eigenphases.\n\nFor $h_1(k_x)$, the Hamiltonian is described by the vector $\\vec{d}_1(k_x) = \\lambda_x(\\cos k_x, 0, \\sin k_x)$ on the Bloch sphere (spanned by $(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$). As $k_x$ evolves from $0$ to $2\\pi$, $\\vec{d}_1(k_x)$ traces a great circle in the $x$-$z$ plane. The occupied eigenstate corresponds to the spin pointing opposite to $\\vec{d}_1(k_x)$. The Berry phase of this state is half the solid angle subtended by the path of the spin vector, which is also a great circle. The solid angle of a great circle is $2\\pi$, so the Berry phase is $\\gamma_1 = \\pi$.\n\nFor $h_2(k_x)$, the Hamiltonian is described by the vector $\\vec{d}_2(k_x) = \\lambda_x(\\cos k_x, 0, -\\sin k_x)$. The occupied state corresponds to the spin pointing opposite to $\\vec{d}_2(k_x)$, i.e., along $-\\vec{d}_2(k_x) = \\lambda_x(-\\cos k_x, 0, \\sin k_x)$. As $k_x$ evolves from $0$ to $2\\pi$, this vector traces the same great circle as $\\vec{d}_1(k_x)$. Thus, the Berry phase is also $\\gamma_2=\\pi$.\n\nSince the two blocks are decoupled, the Wilson loop matrix is diagonal in the basis of the Wannier states corresponding to each block. The eigenphases are simply the Berry phases calculated for each block. Therefore, the two Wilson loop eigenphases are $\\theta_1=\\pi$ and $\\theta_2=\\pi$.\n\n**2. Nested Wilson loop spectrum along $k_y$**\n\nThe nested Wilson loop calculation involves computing the Berry phase of a Wannier state as a function of the transverse momentum, $k_y$. A Wannier state $|w_n(k_y)\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of the Wilson loop operator $W_x(k_y)$:\n$$\nW_x(k_y)|w_n(k_y)\\rangle = e^{i\\theta_n(k_y)}|w_n(k_y)\\rangle\n$$\nThe problem specifies selecting a Wannier sector with eigenphase $\\pi$. From our previous calculation, both sectors have this eigenphase. Let's select one, say $|w_1(k_y)\\rangle$. The nested Wilson loop phase is then the Berry phase of this state:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{nested}} = \\oint dk_y \\, A_y^{(1)}(k_y) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad A_y^{(1)}(k_y) = i\\langle w_1(k_y)|\\partial_{k_y}|w_1(k_y)\\rangle\n$$\nThe crucial observation is that the Hamiltonian $H(k_x)$ is completely independent of $k_y$. This implies:\n1.  The Bloch eigenstates $|u_{a, \\mathbf{k}}\\rangle$ spanning the occupied subspace can be chosen to be independent of $k_y$. Let's denote them $|u_{a, k_x}\\rangle$.\n2.  The Berry connection matrix $\\mathcal{A}_x(\\mathbf{k})$ used to compute the Wilson loop is independent of $k_y$: $(\\mathcal{A}_x)_{ab}(k_x) = i \\langle u_{a, k_x} | \\partial_{k_x} u_{b, k_x} \\rangle$.\n3.  The Wilson loop operator $W_x(k_y) = \\mathcal{P}\\exp(-i\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\mathcal{A}_x(k_x) dk_x)$ is a constant matrix, independent of $k_y$.\n\nSince $W_x$ does not depend on $k_y$, its eigenvalues $\\theta_n$ are constant, and its eigenvectors, the Wannier states $|w_n(k_y)\\rangle$, can be chosen to be independent of $k_y$. Let's denote a basis of such constant Wannier states as $\\{|w_n\\rangle\\}$.\n\nFor the chosen Wannier state $|w_1(k_y)\\rangle=|w_1\\rangle$, the derivative with respect to $k_y$ is zero:\n$$\n\\partial_{k_y}|w_1(k_y)\\rangle = \\partial_{k_y}|w_1\\rangle = 0\n$$\nConsequently, the nested Berry connection $A_y^{(1)}(k_y)$ is identically zero for all $k_y$. The nested Berry phase is the integral of this zero connection, which is zero:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{nested}} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} 0 \\, dk_y = 0\n$$\nThis result is physically sensible. The parameter choice $\\lambda_y=0$ effectively decouples the 1D chains, leading to a trivial band structure in the $k_y$ direction. The Wannier bands are flat, and a flat band has a trivial Berry phase of $0$.\n\nCombining the results, the two first Wilson loop eigenphases are $\\pi$ and $\\pi$, and the nested Wilson loop eigenphase is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\pi & \\pi & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2979709"}, {"introduction": "The hallmark of topological phases is the robustness of their boundary states against local perturbations that preserve the protecting symmetries.

We can therefore let it act on the bra vector $\\langle \\psi_{c} |$.\nThe action of $\\Pi$ on the bra is given by taking the Hermitian conjugate of its action on the ket:\n$$\n\\langle \\psi_{c} | \\Pi = \\langle \\psi_{c} | \\Pi^{\\dagger} = (\\Pi |\\psi_{c}\\rangle)^{\\dagger} = (s|\\psi_{c}\\rangle)^{\\dagger} = s^{*} \\langle \\psi_{c} |\n$$\nSince $s$ is real ($s=\\pm 1$), $s^{*}=s$. Thus, $\\langle \\psi_{c} | \\Pi = s \\langle \\psi_{c} |$.\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $E^{(1)}$:\n$$\nE^{(1)} = -s ( \\langle \\psi_{c} | \\Pi ) \\delta H | \\psi_{c} \\rangle = -s ( s \\langle \\psi_{c} | ) \\delta H | \\psi_{c} \\rangle = -s^2 \\langle \\psi_{c} | \\delta H | \\psi_{c} \\rangle\n$$\nSince $s^2=1$, and recalling that the original expression was $E^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_{c} | \\delta H | \\psi_{c} \\rangle$, we arrive at the relation:\n$$\nE^{(1)} = -E^{(1)}\n$$\nThis equation has a unique solution:\n$$\n2E^{(1)} = 0 \\implies E^{(1)} = 0\n$$\nThe first-order correction to the energy of the corner state is exactly zero. This result is not a coincidence but a direct consequence of the chiral symmetry. The perturbation, despite being non-zero, cannot shift the energy of the corner mode at first order because it is constrained by the same symmetry that protects the zero mode in the first place.\n\nThis result can also be understood by analyzing the matrix elements of the individual components of the perturbation, $\\delta H = m_{x}\\,\\Gamma_{4} + m_{y}\\,\\Gamma_{2}$. The calculation $E^{(1)} = 0$ implies that $\\langle \\psi_{c} | \\delta H | \\psi_{c} \\rangle = 0$. Since $m_x$ and $m_y$ are independent small parameters, this must hold for their coefficients separately: $\\langle \\psi_{c} | \\Gamma_{4} | \\psi_{c} \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle \\psi_{c} | \\Gamma_{2} | \\psi_{c} \\rangle = 0$. This is guaranteed because both $\\Gamma_2$ and $\\Gamma_4$ anticommute with $\\Pi$. A general theorem states that for any operator $A$ that anticommutes with a chiral symmetry operator $\\Pi$, its expectation value in any eigenstate of $\\Pi$ is zero.\n\nThe problem also asks whether the corner state remains midgap and exponentially localized.\n-   **Midgap Property**: Our calculation shows that $E^{(1)}=0$. The energy of the perturbed state, to first order, is $E = E^{(0)} + E^{(1)} = 0 + 0 = 0$. The state remains at zero energy, i.e., in the middle of the bulk energy gap. This is a hallmark of a symmetry-protected topological state; the protecting symmetry (chiral symmetry, in this case) pins the state's energy to the special value ($E=0$) as long as the perturbation respects the symmetry.\n-   **Localization**: The existence of a localized corner state is tied to the nontrivial bulk topology of the system, which manifests as a nonzero bulk energy gap. The perturbation $\\delta H$ is small ($|m_x|, |m_y| \\ll |\\lambda_x|, |\\lambda_y|$), meaning it is much smaller than the energy scales that determine the bulk gap. Such a small, symmetry-preserving perturbation will not close the bulk gap. As long as the bulk gap remains open and the protecting symmetries are intact, the topological properties and their boundary manifestations, including the exponentially localized corner states, are robust. Therefore, the state remains exponentially localized at the corner.\n\nThe final answer requested is the single analytic expression for $E^{(1)}$. The request to report the energy in units of the unperturbed bandwidth is trivially satisfied, as zero divided by any finite bandwidth is still zero.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2979765"}]}
