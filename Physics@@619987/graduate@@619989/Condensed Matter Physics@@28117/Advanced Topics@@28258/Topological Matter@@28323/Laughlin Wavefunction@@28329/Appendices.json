The analyticity of $P(\\{z_i\\})$ is the defining feature of an LLL state in this representation. For the Laughlin state at filling factor $\\nu=1/m$, the polynomial part is\n$$ P_m(\\{z_i\\}) = \\prod_{1 \\le i < j \\le N} (z_i - z_j)^m $$\nSince $m$ is an odd integer, $P_m$ is correctly antisymmetric.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. Multiplying the holomorphic polynomial part of a many-body LLL state by $\\prod_{i=1}^N (z_i - \\eta)$ yields another LLL state and corresponds to a localized quasihole at $\\eta$ carrying fractional charge $e/m$.**\n\nLet us analyze this statement piece by piece.\n1.  **\"yields another LLL state\"**: The original holomorphic part is an antisymmetric polynomial, $P_m(\\{z_i\\})$. The new holomorphic part would be $P_{qh}(\\{z_i\\}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^N (z_i - \\eta)\\right) P_m(\\{z_i\\})$. The factor $\\prod_{i=1}^N (z_i - \\eta)$ is a symmetric polynomial in the $\\{z_i\\}$. The product of a symmetric polynomial and an antisymmetric polynomial is antisymmetric. Since both factors are polynomials, their product is also a polynomial. Therefore, $P_{qh}(\\{z_i\\})$ is an antisymmetric polynomial, and the resulting wavefunction is a valid many-body LLL state. This part is correct.\n2.  **\"corresponds to a localized quasihole at $\\eta$\"**: The factor $(z_i - \\eta)$ introduces a zero in the wavefunction for each electron at the position $\\eta$. This means the probability of finding any electron at $\\eta$ is zero, creating a localized deficit of electron density relative to the ground state. This density deficit is known as a quasihole. This part is correct.\n3.  **\"carrying fractional charge $e/m$\"**: This is the standard construction of a Laughlin quasihole. Through Laughlin's plasma analogy or the Berry phase argument (adiabatically moving $\\eta$ in a loop), the localized charge of this excitation can be calculated. The result is that the quasihole carries a positive charge of $e^* = \\nu e = (1/m)e$. This part is correct.\n\nSince all parts of the statement are correct, the statement as a whole is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Multiplying the holomorphic polynomial part by $\\prod_{i=1}^N (z_i - \\eta)^{-1}$ produces a localized quasielectron at $\\eta$ that already lies in the LLL, because the resulting function is analytic for all $z_i \\neq \\eta$.**\n\nThe proposed new state has a \"holomorphic\" part $F_{qe}(\\{z_i\\}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^N (z_i - \\eta)^{-1}\\right) P_m(\\{z_i\\})$. This function has poles at $z_i = \\eta$ for each $i$. A state is in the LLL if its spatial part is an analytic function of $z$ (times the Gaussian factor). Analytic functions, by definition, do not have poles; they must be differentiable everywhere in their domain (the complex plane, in this case). A function that is analytic except at isolated poles is meromorphic, not analytic. The reasoning \"analytic for all $z_i \\neq \\eta$\" is insufficient. The function must be a polynomial (or more generally, an entire analytic function) to represent an LLL state in this formalism. Therefore, the resulting state does not lie in the LLL.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A localized quasielectron can be obtained by first multiplying by $\\prod_{i=1}^N (z_i - \\eta)^{-1}$ and then projecting to the LLL, which effectively turns each factor $1/(z_i - \\eta)$ into a polynomial in $z_i$ and $\\bar{\\eta}$.**\n\nThis statement proposes a two-step procedure for creating a quasielectron state, which is qualitatively correct: one often starts with a trial state outside the LLL and then projects it down. However, the quantitative description of the outcome of this projection is flawed. Let's analyze the projection of a function like $f(z) = 1/(z-\\eta)$. The LLL projection operator $P_{LLL}$ maps any function onto the space of analytic functions (times the Gaussian). The projection of $f(z)$ is an analytic function $g(z)$ that is \"closest\" to $f(z)$ in the Hilbert space norm. The result of this projection is generally an infinite power series in $z$, not a finite-degree polynomial. For example, using the coherent state basis, the projection involves an integral transform that does not yield a polynomial. The statement that the projection turns $1/(z_i - \\eta)$ into a polynomial in $z_i$ and $\\bar{\\eta}$ is mathematically incorrect. While the proper quasielectron operator, when constructed through other means (e.g., operator formalism), does yield a polynomial depending on $z_i$ and $\\bar{\\eta}$, it is not equivalent to a simple projection of the factor $1/(z_i - \\eta)$. The statement misrepresents the mathematical outcome of the proposed procedure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under LLL projection, any factor of $\\bar{z}_i$ acting on the holomorphic polynomial part is replaced by $2 \\ell_B^2 \\partial_{z_i}$, yielding an analytic polynomial after projection.**\n\nThis statement describes a key result of the operator formalism for the FQHE in the symmetric gauge. Within the LLL, the physical coordinate operators do not commute. The LLL-projected coordinate operators, which act only within the LLL subspace, have the commutation relation $[\\hat{\\bar{z}}_i, \\hat{z}_j] = 2\\ell_B^2 \\delta_{ij}$. A standard representation for these operators acting on the space of analytic polynomials $P(\\{z_k\\})$ is to let $\\hat{z}_i$ be the multiplication by $z_i$ and $\\hat{\\bar{z}}_i$ be the differential operator $2\\ell_B^2 \\partial_{z_i}$.\nLet's verify the commutator:\n$$ [\\hat{\\bar{z}}_i, \\hat{z}_i] P = (2\\ell_B^2 \\partial_{z_i} z_i - z_i 2\\ell_B^2 \\partial_{z_i}) P = 2\\ell_B^2 (\\partial_{z_i}(z_i P) - z_i \\partial_{z_i} P) = 2\\ell_B^2 (P + z_i \\partial_{z_i} P - z_i \\partial_{z_i} P) = 2\\ell_B^2 P $$\nThis confirms the representation is correct. The action of multiplying an LLL state by $\\bar{z}_i$ takes it out of the LLL. Projecting it back is equivalent to replacing $\\bar{z}_i$ with the operator $\\hat{\\bar{z}}_i = 2\\ell_B^2 \\partial_{z_i}$ acting on the polynomial part. Since differentiating a polynomial yields another polynomial, the result is indeed an analytic polynomial. The statement is a correct and fundamental identity in this context.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The LLL projection preserves the norm exactly, so projecting any state into the LLL does not change its normalization.**\n\nA projection operator $P$ in a Hilbert space is an operator that is Hermitian ($P^\\dagger = P$) and idempotent ($P^2 = P$). Let $|\\Psi\\rangle$ be an arbitrary state and $|\\Psi_{proj}\\rangle = P|\\Psi\\rangle$ be its projection onto a subspace. The squared norm of the projected state is\n$$ \\||\\Psi_{proj}\\rangle\\|^2 = \\langle\\Psi_{proj}|\\Psi_{proj}\\rangle = \\langle P\\Psi|P\\Psi\\rangle = \\langle\\Psi|P^\\dagger P|\\Psi\\rangle = \\langle\\Psi|P^2|\\Psi\\rangle = \\langle\\Psi|P|\\Psi\\rangle $$\nThe norm is preserved if and only if $\\||\\Psi_{proj}\\rangle\\|^2 = \\||\\Psi\\rangle\\|^2$, which means $\\langle\\Psi|P|\\Psi\\rangle = \\langle\\Psi|\\Psi\\rangle$. This equality holds only if $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $P$ with eigenvalue $1$, which means $|\\Psi\\rangle$ must already be in the subspace onto which we are projecting. For any state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ that has components outside the LLL, its projection $P_{LLL}|\\Psi\\rangle$ will have a smaller norm. In general, for any projector $P$, $\\|P\\Psi\\| \\leq \\|\\Psi\\|$. Thus, the statement that projection preserves the norm exactly is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nSummary: Statements A and D are correct.
