Two-body interactions projected to the LLL can be expanded in Haldane pseudopotentials as $H=\\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} V_{m} P_{m}$, where $P_{m}$ projects onto a pair state with relative angular momentum $m$, and for spin-polarized fermions only odd $m$ contribute. Consider the filling fraction $\\nu=1/3$, where the Laughlin ground state is known to be the exact zero-energy ground state of the model interaction with $V_{1}>0$ and $V_{m>1}=0$. A quasihole excitation is created by increasing the magnetic flux by $+1$ unit through the system, and a quasielectron excitation is created by decreasing the flux by $-1$ unit.

Introducing a small positive $V_{3}$ necessarily lowers the quasielectron energy relative to the quasihole because only the quasihole has substantial weight in relative angular momentum $m=3$.", "solution": "We begin from the following well-tested facts and definitions that serve as the fundamental base for the analysis:\n\n- In the lowest Landau level (LLL), the kinetic energy is a constant and the interaction energy is fully characterized by Haldane pseudopotentials $V_{m}$ via $H=\\sum_{m} V_{m} P_{m}$, where $P_{m}$ projects any two-particle state onto relative angular momentum $m$. For spin-polarized fermions, only odd $m$ occur.\n- The $\\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state is the exact zero-energy ground state of the model interaction with $V_{1}>0$ and $V_{m>1}=0$. Equivalently, it has vanishing amplitude for any pair at relative angular momentum $m=1$, so $\\langle P_{1}\\rangle=0$ in that state and in any of its zero-energy excitations for this model Hamiltonian.\n- The expectation value of the interaction energy in any normalized state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is $E[\\Psi]=\\sum_{m} V_{m} \\, \\langle \\Psi|P_{m}|\\Psi\\rangle$, so the energy cost of an excitation relative to the ground state is determined by the change $\\Delta p_{m}=\\langle P_{m}\\rangle_{\\mathrm{exc}}-\\langle P_{m}\\rangle_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ in the pair distribution at each $m$.\n\nQuasihole versus quasielectron near-coincidence structure. Let the electron coordinates be $z_{i}=x_{i}+i y_{i}$, and write the $\\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state as an analytic polynomial times a Gaussian, $\\Psi_{\\mathrm{L}}=\\prod_{i<j}(z_{i}-z_{j})^{3}\\, e^{-\\sum_{i}|z_{i}|^{2}/4l_B^{2}}$, where $l_B=\\sqrt{\\hbar/(eB)}$ is the magnetic length. A single quasihole localized at $\\eta$ is obtained (at the level of analytic structure) by multiplication with $\\prod_{i}(z_{i}-\\eta)$, which is analytic in all $z_{i}$. Therefore, as two electrons approach each other, $z_{i}\\to z_{j}$, the factor $(z_{i}-z_{j})^{3}$ controlling the coincidence still ensures at least a third-order zero. Thus, the quasihole does not introduce any $m=1$ pairs: it preserves the constraint $\\langle P_{1}\\rangle=0$ required by the $V_{1}$-only Hamiltonian.\n\nBy contrast, a quasielectron localized near $\\eta$ cannot be created by multiplying by an analytic factor; one natural construction involves differential operators that effectively reduce a unit of flux. A continuum version uses an operator schematically of the form $\\sum_{i}\\left(\\partial_{z_{i}}-\\frac{\\bar{\\eta}}{2l_B^{2}}\\right)$ acting on the Laughlin polynomial, with subsequent LLL projection (the precise form is given by the Girvin–Jach procedure). When derivatives act on $(z_{i}-z_{j})^{3}$, they reduce the order of vanishing at coincidence, generically producing terms proportional to $(z_{i}-z_{j})$ and hence a nonzero amplitude in the $m=1$ channel. Therefore, a quasielectron inevitably has $\\langle P_{1}\\rangle>0$ and thus acquires finite energy whenever $V_{1}>0$.\n\nWith these principles, we analyze each model:\n\n- Model I ($V_{1}>0$, $V_{m>1}=0$): The quasihole preserves $\\langle P_{1}\\rangle=0$ and is an exact zero-energy eigenstate. The quasielectron has $\\langle P_{1}\\rangle>0$ and therefore a strictly positive energy $E_{\\mathrm{QE}}=V_{1}\\,\\Delta p_{1}>0$ above the Laughlin ground state.\n- Model II (Coulomb-like, $V_{m}>0$ decreasing with $m$): Both excitations carry positive energy because they both alter short- and intermediate-range pair correlations relative to the ground state. However, since the quasielectron introduces excess weight at the most strongly penalized channel $m=1$, while the quasihole primarily redistributes weight toward higher $m\\ge 3$, the quasielectron typically incurs a larger energy cost, $E_{\\mathrm{QE}}>E_{\\mathrm{QH}}>0$.\n\nLowest Landau level projection and the challenge of constructing quasielectrons. The quasihole operator is purely holomorphic, $\\prod_{i}(z_{i}-\\eta)$, and therefore maps LLL states to LLL states without any projection. The quasielectron operator, in contrast, involves derivatives with respect to $z_{i}$ and, in more naive constructions, also $\\bar{z}_{i}$ dependencies; such operations raise Landau levels or produce non-LLL components. To remain within the LLL, one must apply a nontrivial projection (for example, the Girvin–Jach projection), which redistributes the action of the operator over all electrons and yields a highly nonlocal many-body operator. This nonlocality and the need for projection make the explicit construction of a localized quasielectron much more intricate than that of a quasihole.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Under Model I at $\\nu=1/3$, a quasihole retains $\\langle P_{1}\\rangle=0$ and is an exact zero-energy eigenstate of $H=V_{1}P_{1}$. A quasielectron necessarily produces $\\langle P_{1}\\rangle>0$ because derivatives reduce the order of the $(z_{i}-z_{j})^{3}$ zero to $(z_{i}-z_{j})$, creating $m=1$ pairs. Hence $E_{\\mathrm{QE}}=V_{1}\\Delta p_{1}>0$. Correct.\n\nB. For Coulomb-like pseudopotentials with $V_{m}>0$ decreasing in $m$, both excitations cost energy. The quasielectron enhances the most short-range channel $m=1$ and is typically higher in energy than the quasihole, which pushes weight to larger $m\\ge 3$. This ordering is borne out by exact diagonalization and conforms with the pseudopotential hierarchy. Correct.\n\nC. The quasielectron operator involves derivatives that are not purely holomorphic. Without care, such operators leave the LLL. The required LLL projection, such as the Girvin–Jach prescription, generates nonlocal correlations and complicates a localized construction. Correct.\n\nD. Multiplying by a linear analytic factor $\\prod_{i}(z_{i}-\\eta)$ produces a quasihole, not a quasielectron. A quasielectron cannot be obtained by simple multiplication; it requires derivative-like operators and LLL projection, and it is not a zero mode of $V_{1}P_{1}$. Incorrect.\n\nE. It is not true that only the quasihole has substantial $m=3$ weight; both excitations have support in several $m$ channels. Moreover, a small positive $V_{3}$ penalizes $m=3$ pairs regardless of the excitation and does not necessarily lower the quasielectron energy relative to the quasihole. In fact, the quasihole tends to shift weight toward larger $m$ (including $m=3$), so $V_{3}>0$ often penalizes the quasihole more, not the quasielectron; and no generic necessity follows from $V_{3}>0$ alone. The claim as stated, including the word “only,” is incorrect. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A, B, and C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2991085"}]}
