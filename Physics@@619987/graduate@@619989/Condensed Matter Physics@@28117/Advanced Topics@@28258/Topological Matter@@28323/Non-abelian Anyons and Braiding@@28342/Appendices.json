By the associativity of fusion, we can think of this process as first fusing the initial $k-1$ anyons and then fusing their combined topological charge with the $k$-th anyon.\n\nThe state of the first $k-1$ anyons is a superposition of the possible total charge outcomes. The number of ways to obtain the vacuum charge $1$ is $a_{k-1}$, and the number of ways to obtain the charge $\\tau$ is $b_{k-1}$. We can represent this abstractly as the formal sum $a_{k-1} \\cdot 1 + b_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau$.\n\nTo find the outcomes for $k$ anyons, we fuse this result with the $k$-th anyon, which has charge $\\tau$:\n$$ (a_{k-1} \\cdot 1 + b_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau) \\times \\tau $$\nUsing the distributivity of fusion and the given fusion rules:\n$$ a_{k-1} \\cdot (1 \\times \\tau) + b_{k-1} \\cdot (\\tau \\times \\tau) $$\nSubstituting the fusion rules $1 \\times \\tau = \\tau$ and $\\tau \\times \\tau = 1 + \\tau$:\n$$ a_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau + b_{k-1} \\cdot (1 + \\tau) $$\n$$ a_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau + b_{k-1} \\cdot 1 + b_{k-1} \\cdot \\tau $$\nCollecting terms by their resulting charge:\n$$ b_{k-1} \\cdot 1 + (a_{k-1} + b_{k-1}) \\cdot \\tau $$\nFrom this expression, we can read off the dimensions for the fusion of $k$ anyons. The coefficient of the vacuum charge $1$ gives $a_k$, and the coefficient of the charge $\\tau$ gives $b_k$. This yields the following system of recurrence relations:\n$$ a_k = b_{k-1} $$\n$$ b_k = a_{k-1} + b_{k-1} $$\n\nWe are interested in finding an expression for $a_n$. From the first relation, we have $a_k = b_{k-1}$, which implies $a_{k+1} = b_k$. Substituting this into the second relation gives:\n$$ a_{k+1} = a_{k-1} + a_k $$\nThis is the well-known recurrence relation for the Fibonacci numbers.

A basis for this space can be chosen by specifying the intermediate fusion outcome of the first two anyons. In our case, the anyons are all of type $\\sigma$, and the total charge is also $\\sigma$. The fusion rule $\\sigma \\times \\sigma = 1 + \\psi$ indicates that the first two $\\sigma$ anyons can fuse into either a channel $1$ (vacuum) or a channel $\\psi$ (fermion). The fusion of this intermediate particle with the third $\\sigma$ anyon must yield the total charge $\\sigma$. The fusion rules $1 \\times \\sigma = \\sigma$ and $\\psi \\times \\sigma = \\sigma$ confirm that both intermediate channels are allowed. Thus, the fusion space is two-dimensional.

In the basis $\\{|v_1\\rangle, |v_\\psi\\rangle\\}$, this operation is diagonal, as the intermediate particle type is well-defined. The action of $\\sigma_1$ is given by the corresponding $R$-symbols.

Its eigenvalues are the cubes of the eigenvalues of $M$:\n$$\\lambda_1^3 = \\left( R_1^2 \\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{6}) \\right)^3 = R_1^6 \\exp(i\\frac{3\\pi}{6}) = R_1^6 \\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = iR_1^6$$\n$$\\lambda_2^3 = \\left( R_1^2 \\exp(i\\frac{5\\pi}{6}) \\right)^3 = R_1^6 \\exp(i\\frac{15\\pi}{6}) = R_1^6 \\exp(i\\frac{5\\pi}{2}) = R_1^6 \\exp(i(2\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2})) = iR_1^6$$\nBoth eigenvalues of $(B_1 B_2)^3$ are identical. Since $B_1 B_2$ is diagonalizable, it can be written as $M=PDP^{-1}$ where $D$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. Then $M^3 = PD^3P^{-1}$. The matrix $D^3$ is diagonal with identical entries $\\lambda_1^3 = \\lambda_2^3 = iR_1^6$ on the diagonal, so $D^3 = (iR_1^6)I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\nTherefore, $M^3 = P((iR_1^6)I)P^{-1} = (iR_1^6)PIP^{-1} = (iR_1^6)I$.\nThis verifies that the operator $(\\sigma_1\\sigma_2)^3$ is proportional to the identity. The scalar of proportionality is the common eigenvalue $iR_1^6$.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of this scalar:\n$$iR_1^6 = i \\left( \\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{8}) \\right)^6 = i \\exp(-i\\frac{6\\pi}{8}) = i \\exp(-i\\frac{3\\pi}{4})$$\n$$= \\exp(i\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\exp(-i\\frac{3\\pi}{4}) = \\exp(i(\\frac{2\\pi}{4}-\\frac{3\\pi}{4})) = \\exp(-i\\frac{\\pi}{4})$$\nThis complex scalar is $\\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}) + i\\sin(-\\frac{\\pi}{4}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.
