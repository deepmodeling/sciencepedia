The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n#### 1) Derivation of the Shift $\\mathcal{S}$\n\nThe total number of electrons, $N_e$, must equal the total number of available states in the $n$ filled Landau levels for the composite fermions. The number of states in each level $k$ is given by its degeneracy $g_k$.\n\nThe total number of electrons is the sum of the degeneracies of the filled CF Landau levels:\n$$\nN_e = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} g_k = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\left[ 2(Q^{\\star} + k) + 1 \\right]\n$$\nWe can split the sum:\n$$\nN_e = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2Q^{\\star} + 1) + 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k\n$$\nThe first term is a sum of $n$ identical terms, and the second is the sum of an arithmetic series:\n$$\nN_e = n(2Q^{\\star} + 1) + 2 \\left( \\frac{(n-1)n}{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nN_e = 2nQ^{\\star} + n + n(n-1) = 2nQ^{\\star} + n + n^2 - n\n$$\n$$\nN_e = 2nQ^{\\star} + n^2\n$$\nThis equation relates the number of electrons $N_e$ to the effective monopole strength $Q^{\\star}$ and the number of filled CF levels $n$. We can rearrange it to express $2Q^{\\star}$:\n$$\n2Q^{\\star} = \\frac{N_e - n^2}{n} = \\frac{N_e}{n} - n\n$$\nNow, we use the given flux attachment rule:\n$$\n2Q^{\\star} = 2Q - 2p(N_e - 1)\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $2Q^{\\star}$ we just derived:\n$$\n\\frac{N_e}{n} - n = 2Q - 2p(N_e - 1)\n$$\nWe need to find the shift $\\mathcal{S}$, which appears in the defining relation $2Q = \\nu^{-1}N_e - \\mathcal{S}$. To do this, we first solve the above equation for $2Q$:\n$$\n2Q = \\frac{N_e}{n} - n + 2p(N_e - 1)\n$$\n$$\n2Q = \\frac{N_e}{n} - n + 2pN_e - 2p\n$$\nGroup the terms proportional to $N_e$ and the constant terms:\n$$\n2Q = N_e \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + 2p \\right) - (n + 2p)\n$$\nLet's express the coefficient of $N_e$ with a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{n} + 2p = \\frac{1 + 2pn}{n}\n$$\nSo the expression for $2Q$ becomes:\n$$\n2Q = N_e \\left( \\frac{1 + 2pn}{n} \\right) - (n + 2p)\n$$\nWe now compare this result directly with the definition of the shift:\n$$\n2Q = \\nu^{-1} N_e - \\mathcal{S}\n$$\nBy matching the terms, we can identify $\\nu^{-1}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$:\n$$\n\\nu^{-1} = \\frac{1 + 2pn}{n} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\nu = \\frac{n}{1 + 2pn}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p\n$$\nThe derived filling factor $\\nu = \\frac{n}{2pn+1}$ perfectly matches the one given in the problem statement, which serves as a successful consistency check of the derivation. The closed-form expression for the shift is $\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p$.\n\n#### 2) Calculation of Specific Shifts\n\nWe use the derived formula $\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p$ and the given filling factors to find the integer parameters $n$ and $p$.\n\nFor $\\nu = \\dfrac{2}{5}$:\nWe match this to the general form $\\nu = \\dfrac{n}{2pn+1}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{n}{2pn+1}\n$$\nBy inspection, setting the numerator $n=2$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{2}{2p(2)+1} = \\frac{2}{4p+1}\n$$\nComparing the denominators, we have $5 = 4p+1$, which gives $4p=4$, so $p=1$.\nWith $n=2$ and $p=1$, the shift is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p = 2 + 2(1) = 4\n$$\n\nFor $\\nu = \\dfrac{3}{7}$:\nWe again match this to the general form:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{n}{2pn+1}\n$$\nBy inspection, setting the numerator $n=3$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{2p(3)+1} = \\frac{3}{6p+1}\n$$\nComparing the denominators, we have $7 = 6p+1$, which gives $6p=6$, so $p=1$.\nWith $n=3$ and $p=1$, the shift is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p = 3 + 2(1) = 5\n$$\n\n#### 3) Verification of Consistency\n\nThe topological shift for a hierarchical or composite fermion quantum Hall state is generally understood to be additive. It consists of a contribution from the effective integer quantum Hall state of the quasiparticles (the composite fermions) and a contribution from the flux attachment procedure itself.\n\nThe standard expectation from the associated Chern-Simons field theory is $\\mathcal{S} = \\mathcal{S}_{\\text{IQHE}} + \\mathcal{S}_{\\text{flux}}$. For a state where composite fermions fill $n$ Landau levels, the integer quantum Hall part of the shift is $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{IQHE}} = n$. The flux attachment part, corresponding to binding $2p$ flux quanta to each electron, contributes $\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{flux}} = 2p$.\nTherefore, the expected shift is $\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p$.\n\nOur derived expression $\\mathcal{S} = n + 2p$ is in exact agreement with this established theoretical expectation. The result correctly decomposes into a part $n$ depending on the number of filled CF Landau levels and a part $2p$ depending on the number of attached flux quanta. Our calculated values ($\\mathcal{S}=4$ for $\\nu=2/5$ and $\\mathcal{S}=5$ for $\\nu=3/7$) are therefore consistent with the known topological data for Jain sequence states.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 5\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2976554"}, {"introduction": "While the composite fermion model successfully explains the sequence of observed fractional quantum Hall states by mapping them to simpler integer quantum Hall states of CFs, it doesn't fully explain *why* these states are energetically stable. This practice delves into the crucial role of electron-electron interactions, characterized by Haldane pseudopotentials, in selecting and stabilizing FQH ground states. You will reason about how the short-range structure of the interaction potential favors certain CF states over others, providing a deeper physical intuition for the robustness of the FQHE [@problem_id:2976558].", "problem": "Consider a spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gas subjected to a strong perpendicular magnetic field, projected to the lowest Landau level (LLL), and interacting via a translationally and rotationally invariant two-body interaction. In the LLL, such an interaction is completely characterized by its Haldane pseudopotentials $V_m$, where $m$ is the relative pair angular momentum (odd integers for fermions). In the composite fermion (CF) picture, each electron attaches $2p$ vortices (flux quanta) to form CFs that experience a reduced effective magnetic field, yielding the Jain sequence of fractions $\\nu = \\dfrac{n}{2pn \\pm 1}$ with integer $n,p \\ge 1$. Focus on the $p=1$ Jain fractions with the plus sign, namely $\\nu = 1/3,\\,2/5,\\,3/7,\\dots$, and assume the system is on a sphere with the usual flux shifts for these trial states.\n\nYou are asked to reason, from the definitions above and the structure of Haldane pseudopotentials and CF wave functions, about how short-range interaction modelsâ€”specifically truncations that keep only $V_1$ or strongly suppress higher $V_m$â€”alter the relative stability of Jain fractions, and to identify which pseudopotentials most strongly control the energy gaps at these fractions.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. In a model where only $V_1$ is nonzero, the Laughlin state at $\\nu = 1/3$ is an exact zero-energy ground state at the highest possible filling among zero-energy states; Jain fractions with $n \\ge 2$, such as $\\nu = 2/5$ and $\\nu = 3/7$, are energetically disfavored under such a truncated interaction because their pair distributions include relative angular momentum $m=1$.\n\nB. The energy gap at $\\nu = 2/5$ is controlled entirely by $V_5$, with negligible sensitivity to $V_1$ and $V_3$.\n\nC. Increasing the ratio $V_3/V_1$ (while keeping $V_1>0$) tends to enhance the relative stability of $\\nu = 2/5$ and $\\nu = 3/7$ compared to interactions dominated by $V_1$, because these states place nonzero weight at $m=1$ and $m=3$ (and at $m=5$ for $\\nu=3/7$); thus $V_1$ and $V_3$ are the most influential pseudopotentials for $p=1$ Jain fractions.\n\nD. Truncating the interaction to $V_1$ alone generically produces an incompressible state at $\\nu = 1/2$.\n\nE. When the ratio $V_3/V_1$ is reduced (the interaction becomes more short-range), the Jain fractions $\\nu = 2/5$ and $\\nu = 3/7$ weaken relative to $\\nu = 1/3$.", "solution": "The setting is the lowest Landau level (LLL) with a translationally and rotationally invariant two-body interaction fully described by Haldane pseudopotentials $V_m$. The many-body energy of a given normalized LLL state can be expressed in terms of the occupation (pair amplitude) of two-particle relative angular momentum channels. Specifically, letting $\\mathcal{G}_m$ denote the probability (per pair) to find two electrons in a state of relative angular momentum $m$, the interaction energy per particle can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{E}{N} = \\sum_{m \\in \\{1,3,5,\\dots\\}} V_m\\, \\mathcal{G}_m,\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the particle number and $m$ is odd for fermions. This follows from projection of the interaction into the LLL and expansion in the complete basis of two-body relative angular momentum eigenstates; $V_m$ are the corresponding matrix elements, and $\\mathcal{G}_m$ are expectation values of the two-body projectors $P_m$.\n\nFor the Laughlin state at $\\nu = 1/q$ with $q$ odd, the wave function vanishes as $(z_i - z_j)^q$ as any two particles approach, which implies that $\\mathcal{G}_m = 0$ for $m < q$ and $\\mathcal{G}_q > 0$ (and for higher $m$ as allowed by many-body constraints). In particular, for $\\nu=1/3$ one has $\\mathcal{G}_1 = 0$ and $\\mathcal{G}_3 > 0$. For the Jain fractions at $p=1$ with $n \\ge 2$ (e.g., $\\nu=2/5$ and $\\nu=3/7$), the CF construction multiplies a Slater determinant of $n$ filled CF levels by a Jastrow factor $\\prod_{i<j}(z_i - z_j)^{2p}$ with $p=1$. The short-distance behavior is softened relative to the Laughlin $1/3$ state: while pair amplitudes at small $m$ are suppressed, they do not vanish identically at $m=1$; generically $\\mathcal{G}_1 > 0$, and $\\mathcal{G}_3$ and $\\mathcal{G}_5$ are also nonzero with increasing weight as $n$ increases. These qualitative features are borne out by explicit evaluations of pair correlation functions and pair amplitudes for CF trial states.\n\nWe now analyze each statement.\n\nA. In the truncated model with only $V_1$ nonzero and $V_m = 0$ for $m \\ge 3$, the Hamiltonian is $H = V_1 \\sum P_1$. Any state with $\\mathcal{G}_1 = 0$ is an exact zero-energy eigenstate. The Laughlin state at $\\nu=1/3$ has $\\mathcal{G}_1 = 0$ and thus $E=0$. Moreover, among zero-energy states with $\\mathcal{G}_1=0$, the densest translationally invariant ground state is at $\\nu=1/3$: this can be seen from the guiding-center (thin-torus) root pattern constraint that forbids adjacent occupied orbitals to avoid $m=1$, leading to the densest periodic pattern of occupation $100100\\cdots$ with density $\\nu=1/3$. Jain states with $n \\ge 2$ possess $\\mathcal{G}_1 > 0$, so they acquire positive energy under this truncated interaction and are therefore energetically disfavored relative to $\\nu=1/3$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. For $\\nu=2/5$, the dominant short-range contributions to the energy arise from $m=1$ and $m=3$ channels because the CF state does not eliminate $m=1$, and it has significant weight in $m=3$. The $m=5$ channel contributes but is typically subdominant compared to $m=1$ and $m=3$ for realistic LLL interactions such as Coulomb or moderate short-range modifications. Therefore, claiming that the gap is controlled entirely by $V_5$ and that $V_1$ and $V_3$ are negligible contradicts the established hierarchy of pseudopotential importance; $V_1$ and $V_3$ are the most influential for $\\nu=2/5$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Consider an interaction initially dominated by $V_1$ (large $V_1$ with $V_3, V_5$ small or zero). In this limit, $\\nu=1/3$ is favored because $\\mathcal{G}_1=0$, while $\\nu=2/5$ and $\\nu=3/7$ are disfavored due to $\\mathcal{G}_1>0$. Increasing $V_3$ at fixed $V_1$ moves the interaction toward more realistic LLL profiles (e.g., Coulomb), in which the balance among $V_1$ and $V_3$ provides the necessary short-range repulsion structure to stabilize $\\nu=2/5$ and $\\nu=3/7$. Since these Jain states place nonzero weight at $m=1$ and $m=3$ (and at $m=5$ for $\\nu=3/7$), the most influential pseudopotentials for $p=1$ Jain fractions are indeed $V_1$ and $V_3$ (with $V_5$ becoming relevant for $\\nu=3/7$). While increasing $V_3$ also increases the absolute energy of these states (because $\\mathcal{G}_3>0$), the key point about relative stability is the discrimination induced by an interaction dominated by $V_1$: reducing that discrimination by bringing $V_3$ to realistic values enhances the robustness of $\\nu=2/5$ and $\\nu=3/7$ relative to the $V_1$-only limit. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. At $\\nu=1/2$, the celebrated composite fermion Fermi sea is a compressible state for LLL Coulomb-like interactions. A truncated model with only $V_1$ nonzero does not generically turn $\\nu=1/2$ into an incompressible state; the $V_1$ parent Hamiltonian singles out zero-energy states that eliminate $m=1$ pairs, with the densest translationally invariant such state at $\\nu=1/3$. There is no mechanism in $V_1$-only truncation to produce a gap at $\\nu=1/2$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Reducing $V_3/V_1$ (making the interaction more sharply short-range) increases the relative weight of the $m=1$ channel in setting energies. Since $\\nu=2/5$ and $\\nu=3/7$ have $\\mathcal{G}_1>0$, their energies grow more rapidly under such short-range domination than the energy of $\\nu=1/3$, which has $\\mathcal{G}_1=0$ and is protected in the $V_1$-only limit. Consequently, the relative stability of $\\nu=2/5$ and $\\nu=3/7$ weakens compared to $\\nu=1/3$ as $V_3/V_1$ is reduced. This trend is well known in studies of finite layer thickness or modified interactions that effectively reduce $V_3$ relative to $V_1$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nIn summary, the influential pseudopotentials for $p=1$ Jain fractions are $V_1$ and $V_3$ (with $V_5$ increasingly relevant as $n$ grows), and truncating to a short-range $V_1$ model strongly favors $\\nu=1/3$ while suppressing higher $n$ Jain fractions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "2976558"}, {"introduction": "A profound feature of topological phases of matter is the bulk-edge correspondence, which dictates that the properties of the gapped bulk state determine the nature of the gapless excitations at its boundary.

The conceptsâ€”Jain-sequence states, composite fermions, flux attachment, generalized exclusion principles, and the correspondence between the orbital entanglement spectrum (OES) and the conformal field theory (CFT) describing the edge excitationsâ€”are all standard and central topics in modern condensed matter physics. The problem provides a clear, self-contained, and formalizable set of rules and numerical parameters, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. The task of numerically verifying the OES-CFT correspondence is a standard and insightful exercise in this field.\n\nThe solution is implemented by performing two independent counting procedures for the number of low-energy excitations and comparing the results.\n\n### 1. Orbital Entanglement Spectrum (OES) Counting from Microscopic Model\n\nThis approach counts the allowed many-body configurations directly using the microscopic rules of the system.\n\n**a. Generalized Exclusion Principle**\nThe problem states that in the thin-torus limit, a Jain state at filling fraction $\\nu = \\frac{n}{2n+1}$ is characterized by a \"generalized exclusion rule\": in any contiguous block of $r = 2n+1$ orbitals, there can be at most $k=n$ particles. These configurations are often called \"admissible\" or \"squeezed\" states.\n\n**b. Baseline Configuration and Momentum ($K_0$)**\nThe reference state for calculating momentum shifts is the minimal left-justified configuration. This is the admissible configuration of $N_A$ particles in $L_A$ orbitals that minimizes the total orbital momentum $K_A = \\sum_{j} j\\,n_j$, where $n_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is the occupation of orbital $j$. This state is constructed via a greedy algorithm: starting from orbital $j=0$, we place a particle if and only if it does not violate the exclusion rule. We proceed until all $N_A$ particles are placed. The momentum of this state is the baseline momentum, $K_0$.\n\n**c. Enumeration of Excitations**\nExcited states are all other admissible configurations with the same number of particles $N_A$. To find these, a recursive backtracking (depth-first search) algorithm is employed. The algorithm systematically constructs all possible placements of $N_A$ particles into $L_A$ orbitals, pruning any search branch that violates the generalized exclusion rule.\n\nFor each valid configuration found, its total momentum $K_A$ is calculated, and the momentum shift relative to the baseline is computed as $\\Delta K = K_A - K_0$. The number of distinct configurations that yield the same $\\Delta K$ gives the OES multiplicity, which we denote as $C_{\\text{OES}}(\\Delta K)$. This counting is performed for $\\Delta K$ up to a specified maximum value $M_{\\text{check}}$.\n\n### 2. Edge Conformal Field Theory (CFT) Multiplicity Counting\n\nThis approach uses the effective field theory that describes the low-energy physics at the edge of the FQHE liquid.\n\n**a. Edge Mode Structure**\nFor a Jain state with parameter $n$, the edge theory is described by $n$ independent, gapless, chiral boson modes. An excitation in this system is created by adding momentum to these modes. The multiplicity of states at a total momentum shift $\\Delta K$ is the number of ways this momentum can be distributed among the $n$ bosonic modes.\n\n**b. Generating Function and Partition a(q) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} p(k)q^k = \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1-q^m}$. The total generating function for $n$ independent and identical modes is the $n$-th power of this single-mode generating function:\n$$G_n(q) = [P(q)]^n = \\left( \\prod_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1-q^m} \\right)^n$$\nThe number of states at momentum shift $\\Delta K$, denoted $C_{\\text{CFT}}(\\Delta K)$, is the coefficient of the $q^{\\Delta K}$ term in the series expansion of $G_n(q)$.\n\n**c. Computational Algorithm**\nThe coefficients $C_{\\text{CFT}}(\\Delta K)$ are computed as follows:\n1.  First, we compute the coefficients of $P(q)$, which are the integer partition numbers $p(k)$. These can be calculated efficiently using Euler's pentagonal number theorem, which gives the recurrence:\n    $$p(k) = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} (-1)^{j-1} \\left( p\\left(k - \\frac{j(3j-1)}{2}\\right) + p\\left(k - \\frac{j(3j+1)}{2}\\right) \\right)$$\n2.  Next, we find the coefficients of $[P(q)]^n$. This is done by repeatedly convolving the coefficient series with itself. If $C_1(k) = p(k)$, then the coefficients for $n$ modes are given by the series $C_n(q)$, which is obtained by computing $C_i(q) = C_{i-1}(q) \\cdot P(q)$ for $i=2, \\dots, n$. Computationally, this corresponds to the discrete convolution of the coefficient arrays.\n\n### 3. Comparison\n\nThe final step is to compare the two sets of counts, $C_{\\text{OES}}(\\Delta K)$ and $C_{\\text{CFT}}(\\Delta K)$, for each integer momentum shift $\\Delta K$ from $0$ up to $M_{\\text{check}}$. The value $M_{\\text{check}} = \\min(M_{\\text{target}}, S)$ is chosen to ensure the comparison is made in a regime where finite-size effects, quantified by the slack $S$, are minimal. The slack $S = (L_A - 1) - j_{\\text{last}}$ represents the number of empty orbitals available at the right edge of the minimal configuration, providing a measure of the \"room\" for low-energy excitations before they are affected by the boundary at $j=L_A-1$. If the counts match for all $\\Delta K$ in this range, the correspondence is verified for that test case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to run the validation for all test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    test_cases = [\n        # (n, L_A, N_A, M_target)\n        (1, 24, 6, 6),  # Test case 1\n        (2, 25, 8, 5),  # Test case 2\n        (3, 28, 10, 4), # Test case 3\n        (2, 15, 6, 3),  # Test case 4\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Pre-calculate partitions up to a global max M_target to be safe\n    max_m_target = max(tc[3] for tc in test_cases)\n    partitions_p = _calculate_partitions(max_m_target + 10) # a bit of buffer\n\n    for n, L_A, N_A, M_target in test_cases:\n        # Step 1: Compute minimal config and baseline momentum K0\n        min_config_indices, K0 = _get_minimal_config(n, L_A, N_A)\n        \n        if min_config_indices is None:\n            # This should not happen for the given valid test cases\n            results.append(False)\n            continue\n            \n        # Step 2: Define the comparison range M_check\n        j_last = min_config_indices[-1]\n        S = (L_A - 1) - j_last\n        M_check = min(M_target, S)\n\n        # Step 3: Enumerate all configurations and get OES counts\n        oes_counts = _get_oes_counts(n, L_A, N_A, K0, M_check)\n        \n        # Step 4: Compute CFT multiplicities\n        cft_counts = _get_cft_counts(n, M_check, partitions_p)\n        \n        # Step 5: Compare OES and CFT counts\n        is_match = True\n        for dK in range(M_check + 1):\n            oes_count = oes_counts.get(dK, 0)\n            cft_count = cft_counts[dK]\n            if oes_count != cft_count:\n                is_match = False\n                break\n        results.append(is_match)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\".lower())\n\ndef _get_minimal_config(n, L_A, N_A):\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs the minimal left-justified configuration using a greedy algorithm.\n    Returns the indices of occupied orbitals and the total momentum K0.\n    \"\"\"\n    r = 2 * n + 1\n    k_max = n\n    \n    config_indices = []\n    current_config_for_check = []\n    for j in range(L_A):\n        # Try to place a particle at orbital j\n        current_config_for_check.append(j)\n        is_valid_placement = True\n        # Check against exclusion rule for all windows containing the new particle at j\n        for win_start in range(max(0, j - r + 1), j + 1):\n            win_end = win_start + r - 1\n            # Count existing particles in the window + the new one\n            count = sum(1 for p_idx in current_config_for_check if win_start = p_idx = win_end)\n            if count > k_max:\n                is_valid_placement = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_valid_placement:\n            config_indices.append(j)\n            if len(config_indices) == N_A:\n                break\n        current_config_for_check = list(config_indices)\n\n    if len(config_indices)  N_A:\n        return None, None\n        \n    K0 = sum(config_indices)\n    return config_indices, K0\n\ndef _get_oes_counts(n, L_A, N_A, K0, M_check):\n    \"\"\"\n    Enumerates all valid configurations and counts them based on momentum shift.\n    \"\"\"\n    oes_counts = {0: 1} # Baseline config has dK=0 and count 1\n    \n    for config_indices in _generate_valid_configs(n, L_A, N_A):\n        K_A = sum(config_indices)\n        dK = K_A - K0\n        if 0 = dK = M_check:\n            oes_counts[dK] = oes_counts.get(dK, 0) + 1\n            \n    # The generator includes the baseline config, so we have to adjust.\n    # A cleaner approach is to have the generator skip the baseline config\n    # but the current structure is also fine.
