Completing this practice will clarify the definition of the Mott gap as the energy cost to create a particle-hole excitation [@problem_id:3006175].", "problem": "Consider the single-band Hubbard model on a lattice in the atomic limit $t=0$, where sites are decoupled.

It is a standard problem in condensed matter physics and is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps as requested by the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Eigenstates and Energies**\n\nThe single-site Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH_{\\text{site}} = U\\, n_{\\uparrow} n_{\\downarrow} - \\mu \\left(n_{\\uparrow} + n_{\\downarrow}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $U  0$ is the on-site Coulomb repulsion, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $n_{\\sigma}$ is the number operator for an electron with spin $\\sigma \\in \\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$.\n\nThe Hilbert space for a single site is spanned by four Fock states, which are eigenstates of the number operators $n_{\\uparrow}$ and $n_{\\downarrow}$. We calculate the energy for each of these states by applying the Hamiltonian. The total electron number on the site is $n = n_{\\uparrow} + n_{\\downarrow}$.\n\n*   **Empty state:** $|0\\rangle$\n    The site is unoccupied, so the number of electrons is $n=0$.

These two states are degenerate in the absence of a magnetic field.\n    For the state $|\\uparrow\\rangle$, the number operator eigenvalues are $N_{\\uparrow} = 1$ and $N_{\\downarrow} = 0$.

The number operator eigenvalues are $N_{\\uparrow} = 1$ and $N_{\\downarrow} = 1$.\n    The energy of this state is:\n    $$\n    E_2 = \\langle \\uparrow\\downarrow | H_{\\text{site}} | \\uparrow\\downarrow \\rangle = U(1)(1) - \\mu(1+1) = U - 2\\mu\n    $$\n\nIn summary, the four eigenstates and their corresponding energies are:\n*   $|0\\rangle$ with energy $E_0 = 0$ (occupancy $n=0$).\n*   $|\\uparrow\\rangle, |\\downarrow\\rangle$ with degenerate energy $E_1 = -\\mu$ (occupancy $n=1$).\n*   $|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle$ with energy $E_2 = U - 2\\mu$ (occupancy $n=2$).\n\n2.  **Ground State and Chemical Potential for Transitions**\n\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), the system occupies the ground state, which is the eigenstate with the lowest energy. The ground state occupancy is determined by which of the energies ($E_0$, $E_1$, $E_2$) is the minimum. We find the transition points by setting the energies equal.\n\nThe state at half-filling ($n=1$) is the ground state when its energy $E_1$ is lower than both $E_0$ and $E_2$.\n*   $E_1  E_0 \\implies -\\mu  0 \\implies \\mu  0$.\n*   $E_1  E_2 \\implies -\\mu  U - 2\\mu \\implies \\mu  U$.\nTherefore, the half-filled state with average occupancy $n=1$ is the ground state in the chemical potential range $0  \\mu  U$.\n\nThe problem defines $\\mu_{-}$ as the value of $\\mu$ at which the ground-state occupancy changes from $n=1$ to $n=0$. This transition occurs when the energies of the respective states are equal.\n$$\nE_1 = E_0 \\implies -\\mu = 0 \\implies \\mu = 0\n$$\nFor $\\mu  0$, we have $E_0  E_1$, so the ground state is the empty state ($n=0$). Thus, the transition from the $n=1$ ground state to the $n=0$ ground state occurs at $\\mu_{-} = 0$.\n\nThe problem defines $\\mu_{+}$ as the value of $\\mu$ at which the ground-state occupancy changes from $n=1$ to $n=2$. This transition occurs when the energies of these states become equal.\n$$\nE_1 = E_2 \\implies -\\mu = U - 2\\mu \\implies \\mu = U\n$$\nFor $\\mu  U$, we have $E_2  E_1$, so the ground state is the doubly-occupied state ($n=2$). Thus, the transition from the $n=1$ ground state to the $n=2$ ground state occurs at $\\mu_{+} = U$.\n\nThe chemical potential for removing an electron from the half-filled state corresponds to the phase boundary with the $n=0$ state, so $\\mu_{-} = 0$. The chemical potential for adding an electron to the half-filled state corresponds to the phase boundary with the $n=2$ state, so $\\mu_{+} = U$.\n\n3.  **Atomic Mott Gap**\n\nThe atomic Mott gap is defined as the difference between the chemical potential required to add an electron and the chemical potential required to remove one, starting from the half-filled ground state.\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{Mott}} = \\mu_{+} - \\mu_{-}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{Mott}} = U - 0 = U\n$$\nThis gap $\\Delta_{\\text{Mott}} = U$ represents the energy cost to create a particle-hole excitation in the atomic limit, i.e., to move an electron from one singly-occupied site to another, creating one doubly-occupied site and one empty site.

In particular, explain how crystal momentum conservation in optical transitions, doublon-holon binding (excitonic effects), and the temperature dependence of carrier densities and mobilities enter, and under what idealized conditions these three scales trace the same underlying many-body charge gap.

The setup is based on the standard Hubbard model, a cornerstone of condensed matter theory, and the descriptions of the experimental techniques (ARPES, optical conductivity, DC transport) and the associated energy scales ($\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}}$) are accurate. The problem requires a careful analysis of the underlying physical processes, which we shall now undertake before evaluating the options.\n\nThe system is a Mott insulator described by the half-filled Hubbard model in the strong coupling limit, $U/W \\gg 1$. The ground state consists of one electron localized on each lattice site. The elementary charge excitations are mobile doubly-occupied sites (doublons, or effective electrons) and empty sites (holons, or effective holes). The fundamental energy cost to create a well-separated doublon-holon pair is the many-body charge gap, denoted as $\\Delta_{c}$. In the atomic limit ($t \\to 0$), $\\Delta_{c} = U$. For finite hopping $t$, $\\Delta_{c}$ is of the order of $U$, with corrections dependent on $t$.\n\nLet us analyze each energy scale based on its definition.\n\n1.  **The Single-Particle Gap, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$**:\n    This gap is observed in single-particle spectroscopies. Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measures the spectral function $A(\\mathbf{k},\\omega)$ for occupied states ($\\omega  \\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential). It probes excitations created by removing an electron. The lowest energy required to create a hole in the system is given by the top of the lower Hubbard band (LHB). Conversely, inverse photoemission spectroscopy probes the spectral function for unoccupied states ($\\omega  \\mu$), corresponding to adding an electron. The lowest energy state for an added electron defines the bottom of the upper Hubbard band (UHB).\n    The single-particle gap $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ is the minimum energy separation between the UHB and LHB. By definition, this is the difference between the minimum energy to add one electron to the $N$-particle ground state and the maximum energy gained by removing one electron. In terms of generalized chemical potentials, this is precisely the many-body charge gap:\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\mu^{+} - \\mu^{-} = (E_{GS}(N+1) - E_{GS}(N)) - (E_{GS}(N) - E_{GS}(N-1)) \\equiv \\Delta_{c} $$\n    Here, $E_{GS}(N)$ is the ground state energy of the $N$-particle system. Thus, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ is the most direct measure of the fundamental charge gap $\\Delta_{c}$.\n\n2.  **The Optical Gap, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$**:\n    This gap is the threshold for absorption in the optical conductivity, $\\sigma(\\omega)$, in the long-wavelength limit ($q \\to 0$). An absorbed photon creates a particle-hole excitation. Due to the negligible momentum of the photon, the transition is \"direct\", meaning the crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ of the excited electron is conserved.\n    In a Mott insulator, the lowest-energy optical excitation involves moving an electron from one site to another, creating a doublon-holon (d-h) pair. This is a neutral, two-particle excitation of the system. If the created doublon and holon are attracted to each other via the Coulomb interaction (which is poorly screened in an insulator), they can form a bound state, known as a charge-transfer exciton. The energy of this exciton is $E_{\\text{ex}} = \\Delta_{c} - E_{b}$, where $E_{b} \\ge 0$ is the exciton binding energy.\n    The optical gap corresponds to the creation of the lowest-energy allowed neutral excitation. Therefore, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ measures the energy of the lowest-energy exciton that can be created by a $q=0$ photon. This implies $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\leq \\Delta_{c}$.\n    The equality $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\Delta_{c}$ holds only if the exciton binding energy $E_b$ is zero or negligible. Furthermore, if the fundamental single-particle gap $\\Delta_{c}$ were indirect (i.e., the maximum of the LHB and minimum of the UHB occur at different $\\mathbf{k}$), the direct optical transition onset could be larger than the indirect gap. However, the most significant deviation is typically due to the exciton binding, leading to $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}  \\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$.\n\n3.  **The Transport Activation Gap, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}}$**:\n    This scale is determined from the temperature dependence of the DC conductivity, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dc}}(T)$. For electrical current to flow, free charge carriers must be present. In a clean, intrinsic insulator, these carriers (doublons and holons) are created by thermal activation across the charge gap $\\Delta_{c}$.\n    The equilibrium densities of electrons ($n_e$, for doublons) and holes ($n_h$, for holons) are governed by the law of mass action. The product of their densities is proportional to an exponential factor determined by the energy required to create a free pair, which is $\\Delta_{c}$:\n    $$ n_{e} n_{h} \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta_{c}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T) $$\n    For a half-filled, particle-hole symmetric system, $n_{e} = n_{h}$. Thus, the carrier density is:\n    $$ n_{e} = n_{h} \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta_{c}/(2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)) $$\n    The DC conductivity is given by $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dc}} = e(n_{e}\\mu_{e} + n_{h}\\mu_{h})$, where $\\mu_{e}$ and $\\mu_{h}$ are the carrier mobilities. Substituting the expression for the carrier densities:\n    $$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{dc}}(T) \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta_{c}/(2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)) (\\mu_{e} + \\mu_{h}) $$\n    The experimentally fitted Arrhenius law is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dc}}(T) \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}}/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$. Comparing these expressions, if the temperature dependence of the mobilities $(\\mu_{e} + \\mu_{h})$ is weak (e.g., a power law in $T$) compared to the exponential dependence of the carrier density, we can identify the transport activation gap as:\n    $$ \\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{\\Delta_{c}}{2} = \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}}{2} $$\n    The factor of $1/2$ is a well-known result for intrinsic semiconductors and insulators, and it directly reflects that the activation energy in a transport measurement corresponds to half the full band gap.\n\n**Summary of Relationships in an Idealized Case**:\nIn a clean, stoichiometric, direct-gap Mott insulator with negligible exciton binding and weakly temperature-dependent mobilities, the relationships are:\n$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\Delta_{c}$\n$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\approx \\Delta_{c}$\n$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\Delta_{c}/2$\nTherefore, one expects $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\approx \\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}} \\approx 2\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}}$.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n**A.** This option states that (i) $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ measures the many-body charge gap $\\Delta_c = \\mu^+ - \\mu^-$; (ii) $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ measures the direct d-h excitation energy, which equals $\\Delta_c$ if exciton binding is negligible; (iii) $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ is related to the carrier density activation, leading to $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta_{c}/2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$ if mobilities are weakly T-dependent. The concluding summary states that under a set of ideal conditions, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\simeq \\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ is half of this value, so one must compare $2\\Delta_{\\mathrmtr}$ to the other two for numerical equality.\nThis statement precisely matches our derivation. Each point is physically correct, and the specified conditions for the relationships to hold are accurate and comprehensive.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option asserts that all three gaps are strictly equal in any Mott insulator and that momentum conservation and excitonic effects are irrelevant. This is fundamentally incorrect. As derived, the three experimental probes measure physically distinct quantities that are not generally equal. $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ differs by a factor of 2 from $\\Delta_c$ due to the statistics of thermal activation. $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ differs from $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ due to exciton binding and momentum selection rules.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option claims that $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is *always* smaller than $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ and that $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ *always* equals $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ in clean samples, independent of other factors. The first part is too strong; while frequent, it is not a universally guaranteed inequality (e.g., it ignores the case of an indirect single-particle gap). The second part, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, is incorrect. This would imply $\\Delta_c/2 = \\Delta_c - E_b$, which is not true in general and has no physical basis. It also incorrectly dismisses the role of mobility temperature dependence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option claims $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ in clean systems, which is incorrect by the factor of $2$. It also claims that $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ *generally exceeds* $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}$, which is the opposite of the effect of exciton binding, the dominant correction in most Mott insulators. The reasoning about disorder is also confused.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, option A is the only one that provides a physically accurate and complete description of the relationships between the three energy scales and the conditions under which they can be related.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3006241"}]}
