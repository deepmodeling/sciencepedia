Assume half filling so that the chemical potential is $\\mu=0$. In the context of Charge Density Wave (CDW) and Spin Density Wave (SDW) instabilities, the concept of Fermi surface nesting is defined as the existence of a vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ such that states on the Fermi surface are mapped onto other states on the Fermi surface by translation by $\\mathbf{Q}$.
