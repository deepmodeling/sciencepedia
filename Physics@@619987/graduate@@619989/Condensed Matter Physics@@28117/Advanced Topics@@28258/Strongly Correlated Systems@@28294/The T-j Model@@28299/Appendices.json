The Fermi velocity characterizes the slope of the electronic dispersion at the Fermi surface. In the context of the linearized Bogoliubov dispersion, $E_{\\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{N}}+\\mathbf{q}}$, the term $v_{F}(x)q_1$ arises from the linearization of the renormalized single-particle dispersion, $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$, around the nodal point $\\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{N}}$.\n\nThe Fermi surface is defined by the condition $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}=0$. The group velocity of a quasiparticle is given by $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$ (since we work in units where $\\hbar=1$). The direction normal to the Fermi surface at a point $\\mathbf{k}$ is parallel to the gradient $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$. The Fermi velocity $v_F$ is the magnitude of this velocity vector evaluated at the Fermi surface. Therefore, we can identify $v_{F}(x)$ as the magnitude of the gradient of $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$ at the nodal point $\\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{N}}$:\n$$v_{F}(x) = \\left| \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} \\right|_{\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{N}}}$$\nFirst, we write the expression for $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$ using the given assumption that $\\mu=0$.\n$$\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} = g_{t}(x) \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)} = g_{t}(x) \\left( -2t\\left[\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right] - 0 \\right)$$\n$$\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} = -2t \\, g_{t}(x) \\left[ \\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) \\right]$$\nNext, we compute the gradient of $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$ with respect to $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y)$.

There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n*   **Conclusion:** The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained for the reasoning task at hand.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nWe analyze the two-hole ground state in two distinct limits as instructed.\n\n**A. The Small $J/t$ Limit**\n\nIn this limit, the kinetic energy term ($t$) dominates, and the two holes can be pictured as weakly interacting quasiparticles. The ground state of the two-hole system will be constructed from the lowest-energy single-hole states.\n\nAccording to **Fact 1**, the single-hole energy dispersion has its minima at four degenerate momentum points in the Brillouin zone: $\\mathbf{k}_{1}=(\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, $\\mathbf{k}_{2}=(\\pi/2, -\\pi/2)$, $\\mathbf{k}_{3}=(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, and $\\mathbf{k}_{4}=(-\\pi/2, -\\pi/2)$.\n\nTo form the two-hole ground state, we place two hole quasiparticles in these low-energy states. The total momentum $\\mathbf{K}$ of the pair is the sum of the individual momenta, $\\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{k}_a + \\mathbf{k}_b$. Since the underlying electrons are fermions, the total wavefunction for the two holes must be antisymmetric. The ground state is generally a spin-singlet (antisymmetric spin part), so its spatial wavefunction must be symmetric under particle exchange.\n\nWith the four degenerate single-particle states, we can construct two-particle states with various total momenta. A key result from detailed studies is that the residual interaction between the hole quasiparticles, mediated by spin fluctuations, lifts the degeneracy. It is a well-established numerical finding for the $4 \\times 4$ cluster that the ground state at small $J/t$ lies in the $\\mathbf{K}=(\\pi, \\pi)$ sector.\n\nThis can be rationalized by considering the combination of two quasiparticles, each with momentum from the set $\\{(\\pm \\pi/2, \\pm \\pi/2)\\}$. For instance, placing two holes (as a spin-singlet) in the *same* single-particle momentum state, e.g., $\\mathbf{k}_a = \\mathbf{k}_b = (\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, yields a total momentum $\\mathbf{K} = (\\pi/2, \\pi/2) + (\\pi/2, \\pi/2) = (\\pi, \\pi)$. Such a state has zero relative momentum, which can be favorable. Other combinations, like $\\mathbf{k}_a = (\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$ and $\\mathbf{k}_b = (-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, yield $\\mathbf{K}=(0,\\pi)$. The weak interaction selects the $\\mathbf{K}=(\\pi,\\pi)$ state as the ground state.\n\nThis reasoning is general and does not rely on the specific lattice size, as long as the single-particle minima are at $(\\pm \\pi/2,\\pm \\pi/2)$. Therefore, we expect this result to hold for both the $L=4$ and $L=8$ clusters, which both accommodate these momenta.\n\nThus, for small $J/t$, the ground state has total momentum $\\mathbf{K}=(\\pi, \\pi)$.\n\n**B. The Large $J/t$ Limit**\n\nIn this limit, the spin-exchange term ($J$) dominates. The system seeks to minimize the number of broken antiferromagnetic bonds, which favors the binding of the two holes into a composite object.\n\n**Fact 2** provides the answer for this limit directly: the ground state is a spin-singlet pair with zero center-of-mass momentum. This means the total momentum of the two-hole ground state is $\\mathbf{K}=(0,0)$. The internal $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry of this pair state is crucial for maximizing the energy gain from the superexchange interaction, but for the present question, the key piece of information is its total momentum.\n\nThis formation of a bound pair with $\\mathbf{K}=(0,0)$ is a robust feature and is expected to be the ground state for any sufficiently large $J/t$ on both the $L=4$ and $L=8$ clusters.\n\n**C. Evolution from Small to Large $J/t$**\n\nWe have established the following:\n*   At small $J/t$, the ground state has total momentum $\\mathbf{K}=(\\pi, \\pi)$.\n*   At large $J/t$, the ground state has total momentum $\\mathbf{K}=(0,0)$.\n\nThe total momentum $\\mathbf{K}$ is a good quantum number because of the lattice's translation symmetry. This means that the Hamiltonian is block-diagonal in the basis of states with definite $\\mathbf{K}$. Eigenstates with different $\\mathbf{K}$ values are orthogonal and do not mix as a parameter ($J/t$) is varied.\n\nFor the ground state to change its momentum from $\\mathbf{K}=(\\pi, \\pi)$ to $\\mathbf{K}=(0,0)$, there must be a **level crossing**. As $J/t$ increases from a small value, the energy of the lowest-lying state in the $\\mathbf{K}=(0,0)$ sector must decrease relative to the energy of the ground state in the $\\mathbf{K}=(\\pi, \\pi)$ sector. At a critical value $(J/t)_c$, the energies of these two states become equal, and for $J/t > (J/t)_c$, the $\\mathbf{K}=(0,0)$ state becomes the new ground state.\n\nThis level crossing signifies a quantum phase transition in the finite system, reflecting the change in the nature of the ground state from two weakly-coupled quasiparticles to a single, tightly bound $d$-wave pair.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of the Options\n\n*   **A. On both $L=4$ and $L=8$ clusters, the ground state at small $J/t$ lies in the $\\mathbf K=(\\pi,\\pi)$ sector and crosses to $\\mathbf K=(0,0)$ at larger $J/t$; this level crossing is consistent with the emergence of a $d_{x^2-y^2}$ bound pair with zero center-of-mass momentum.**\n    This option correctly identifies the ground state momentum in both the small $J/t$ limit ($\\mathbf{K}=(\\pi,\\pi)$) and the large $J/t$ limit ($\\mathbf{K}=(0,0)$). It correctly states that the transition between these distinct momentum sectors must occur via a level crossing. It also correctly connects the large-$J/t$ state to the formation of a bound pair as described in Fact 2. This is fully consistent with our derivation. **Correct.**\n\n*   **B. On both clusters, the ground state remains in the $\\mathbf K=(\\pi,0)$ sector for all $J/t$, so there is no level crossing and no indication of pairing.**\n    This is incorrect. It misidentifies the ground state momentum in both limits and incorrectly claims there is no level crossing, contradicting the change in the physical nature of the state from unbound to bound. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. On the $L=4$ cluster, the ground state at small $J/t$ lies in $\\mathbf K=(0,0)$ and crosses to $\\mathbf K=(\\pi,\\pi)$ at larger $J/t$; the $L=8$ cluster shows the same sequence. This inversion indicates a kinetic-energy-driven pair at large $J/t$.**\n    This option inverts the sequence of ground state momenta. The large-$J/t$ physics is driven by the interaction ($J$), not kinetic energy. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The $L=4$ cluster has the same sequence as in option A, but the $L=8$ cluster shows the opposite sequence (from $\\mathbf K=(0,0)$ at small $J/t$ to $\\mathbf K=(\\pi,\\pi)$ at larger $J/t$) due to Brillouin-zone folding effects on larger lattices.**\n    There is no fundamental physical reason for the qualitative behavior to invert on a larger lattice. The underlying physics of quasiparticle interaction versus pair binding is generic. While finite-size effects exist, they are not expected to cause such a dramatic reversal of the trend. The physical reasoning should apply to both systems. **Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3020650"}, {"introduction": "From the formation of microscopic pairs, we scale up to the properties of the macroscopic superconducting condensate.

Denote by $D_{s}^{(0)}$ the zero-temperature BCS superfluid stiffness computed with the unrenormalized band $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}$ and the same gap function $\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}$.\n\nYour tasks:\n- Derive from first principles of linear response the expression for the Meissner kernel as a diamagnetic plus paramagnetic contribution in terms of band derivatives and BCS quasiparticle spectra, identifying how $g_{t}(x)$ enters.\n- Use gauge invariance to argue the cancellation of one factor of $g_{t}(x)$ between the two-current-vertex bubble and the dynamical response, establishing that the full kernel scales with a single power of $g_{t}(x)$.\n- Conclude the resulting $x$-dependence of $D_{s}(x)$ in terms of $g_{t}(x)$ and $D_{s}^{(0)}$, and extract the low-doping scaling.\n\nGive your final answer as a single closed-form analytical expression for $D_{s}(x)$ in terms of only $x$ and $D_{s}^{(0)}$. No numerical approximation is required, and no units should be included in the final answer.", "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the zero-temperature superfluid stiffness, $D_s(x)$, for the two-dimensional renormalized $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice. The analysis is to be performed within the renormalized mean-field theory (RMFT) where the kinetic energy is renormalized by a Gutzwiller factor $g_t(x)$.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Model: 2D renormalized $t$-$J$ model on a square lattice.\n- Theory: Renormalized Mean-Field Theory (RMFT) with Gutzwiller projection.\n- Hole doping: $x$.\n- Kinetic energy renormalization factor: $g_{t}(x)=\\dfrac{2x}{1+x}$.\n- Effective BCS mean-field Hamiltonian in Nambu space:\n$$ H = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}}\\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{\\dagger}\\left[\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}\\,\\tau_{3}+\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}\\,\\tau_{1}\\right]\\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}} $$\n- Quasiparticle dispersion: $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}=g_{t}(x)\\,\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}-\\mu(x)$.\n- Bare band structure: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}=-2t\\left(\\cos k_{x}a+\\cos k_{y}a\\right)$.\n- Superconducting gap: $\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}=\\Delta_{0}(x)\\left(\\cos k_{x}a-\\cos k_{y}a\\right)$ ($d$-wave).\n- Conditions: Zero temperature, homogeneous superconducting state.\n- Coupling to vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$: Minimal coupling via Peierls substitution.\n- Target quantity: Static, long-wavelength Meissner kernel $K_{xx}(\\mathbf{q}\\to \\mathbf{0},\\omega=0)$, which is defined as the superfluid stiffness $D_s(x)$.\n- Unrenormalized superfluid stiffness $D_s^{(0)}$: Calculated using the bare band $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}$ and the same gap function $\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, rooted in the standard theoretical framework for strongly correlated electron systems and high-temperature superconductivity. It is well-posed, providing a clear objective and all necessary definitions and equations. The language is precise and objective. The tasks are specific and guide a logical path to the solution. The problem is a non-trivial exercise in condensed matter theory but is well-defined and solvable.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Derivation of the Superfluid Stiffness**\n\nThe superfluid stiffness $D_s$ is the real part of the static, uniform ($\\mathbf{q}\\to\\mathbf{0}, \\omega=0$) transverse conductivity, or equivalently, the Meissner kernel $K_{xx}$. It relates the supercurrent density $\\mathbf{J}_s$ to the vector potential $\\mathbf{A}$ via $\\mathbf{J}_s = -D_s \\mathbf{A}$ (in the London gauge, with factors of $c$ or physical constants depending on the unit system). It can be calculated from the second-order change in the free energy (or ground-state energy at $T=0$) with respect to $\\mathbf{A}$, where $\\delta F = \\frac{1}{2} V D_s A_x^2$ for $\\mathbf{A} = A_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and volume $V$.\n\nThe standard method involves applying the Peierls substitution $\\hbar\\mathbf{k} \\to \\hbar\\mathbf{k} - e\\mathbf{A}$ to the Hamiltonian. The problem directs us to apply this to the effective RMFT Hamiltonian. The only term affected is the quasiparticle dispersion $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$:\n$$ \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{A}) = g_t(x) \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k} - (e/\\hbar)\\mathbf{A}}^{(0)} - \\mu(x) $$\nWe expand $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k} - (e/\\hbar)\\mathbf{A}}^{(0)}$ for small, static, and uniform $\\mathbf{A} = A_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k} - (e/\\hbar)A_x\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}}^{(0)} \\approx \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)} - \\frac{e}{\\hbar}A_x \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}}{\\partial k_x} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{e}{\\hbar}A_x\\right)^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}}{\\partial k_x^2} $$\nThe Hamiltonian becomes $H(\\mathbf{A}) = H(0) + \\delta H^{(1)} + \\delta H^{(2)}$, where:\n$$ \\delta H^{(1)} = -A_x \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\left( \\frac{e}{\\hbar} g_t(x) \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}}{\\partial k_x} \\right) \\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{\\dagger} \\tau_3 \\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}} \\equiv -A_x \\hat{J}_x $$\n$$ \\delta H^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{2} A_x^2 \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\left( \\frac{e^2}{\\hbar^2} g_t(x) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}}{\\partial k_x^2} \\right) \\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{\\dagger} \\tau_3 \\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nThe change in ground state energy to second order in $A_x$ is:\n$$ \\delta E_0 = \\langle 0 | \\delta H^{(2)} | 0 \\rangle + \\sum_{n \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle n | \\delta H^{(1)} | 0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0 - E_n} $$\nFrom this, we identify the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the stiffness. We define $D_s = D_s^{\\text{dia}} + D_s^{\\text{para}}$.\n\n**1. Diamagnetic Contribution**\nThe diamagnetic term arises from the first-order perturbation theory of $\\delta H^{(2)}$.\n$$ D_s^{\\text{dia}} = \\frac{1}{V} \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial^2 H}{\\partial A_x^2} \\right\\rangle_{A_x=0} = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\frac{e^2}{\\hbar^2} g_t(x) \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}}{\\partial k_x^2} \\langle 0 | \\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{\\dagger} \\tau_3 \\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}} | 0 \\rangle $$\nThe ground state expectation value in BCS theory is $\\langle 0 | \\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}}^{\\dagger} \\tau_3 \\Psi_{\\mathbf{k}} | 0 \\rangle = -\\frac{\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}}{E_{\\mathbf{k}}}$, where $E_{\\mathbf{k}}=\\sqrt{\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}^2+\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}^2}$ is the quasiparticle energy. Converting the sum to an integral ($V^{-1}\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\to \\int d^2k/(2\\pi)^2$):\n$$ D_s^{\\text{dia}} = -\\frac{e^2}{\\hbar^2} g_t(x) \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}}{\\partial k_x^2} \\frac{\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}}{E_{\\mathbf{k}}} $$\nThis expression fulfills the first part of the task, identifying how $g_t(x)$ enters the diamagnetic term.\n\n**2. Paramagnetic Contribution**\nThe paramagnetic term arises from the second-order perturbation theory of $\\delta H^{(1)}$.\n$$ D_s^{\\text{para}} = -\\frac{2}{V} \\sum_{n \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle n | \\hat{J}_x | 0 \\rangle|^2}{E_n - E_0} $$\nThis is the static current-current correlation function. The current operator vertex is $\\hat{j}_{x,\\mathbf{k}} \\propto g_t(x) (\\partial \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)} / \\partial k_x) \\tau_3$. Since the expression is quadratic in the current, this contribution is proportional to $(g_t(x))^2$. The standard BCS calculation for this response function at $T=0$ yields:\n$$ D_s^{\\text{para}} = -2 \\frac{e^2}{\\hbar^2} (g_t(x))^2 \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}}{\\partial k_x}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}^2}{E_{\\mathbf{k}}^3} $$\nThis term represents the response of the quasiparticles that counteracts the diamagnetic supercurrent. Summing the two contributions gives a naive expression for the total superfluid stiffness:\n$$ D_s(x) = -\\frac{e^2}{\\hbar^2} \\left[ g_t(x) \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}}{\\partial k_x^2} \\frac{\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}}{E_{\\mathbf{k}}} + 2(g_t(x))^2 \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}^{(0)}}{\\partial k_x}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\Delta_{\\mathbf{k}}^2}{E_{\\mathbf{k}}^3} \\right] $$\n\n**3. Gauge Invariance and Factorization of $g_t(x)$**\nThe expression above, with terms proportional to $g_t(x)$ and $(g_t(x))^2$, does not readily factor. The problem correctly indicates that this naive derivation is incomplete and must be corrected by considering gauge-invariance constraints.\nApplying the Peierls substitution directly to the effective QP Hamiltonian is a common but potentially inconsistent shortcut. A rigorous approach must start from the microscopic Hamiltonian and account for how the projection procedure (leading to $g_t$) interacts with the electromagnetic coupling.\nThe fundamental principle of gauge invariance, expressed through the Ward identity, ensures the conservation of the electromagnetic current. In strongly correlated systems, this leads to significant vertex corrections in response functions. The kinetic energy renormalization by $g_t(x)$ is a manifestation of strong correlations reducing the mobility of charge carriers. The effective mass of the quasiparticles is enhanced, $m^* \\sim m/g_t(x)$.\nA powerful consequence of gauge invariance is the optical f-sum rule, which states that the integrated spectral weight of the optical conductivity is proportional to the average kinetic energy of the charge carriers:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty \\sigma_{xx}(\\omega) d\\omega \\propto \\langle -T_x \\rangle $$\nIn the Gutzwiller RMFT, the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator is renormalized: $\\langle T_x \\rangle = g_t(x) \\langle T_x \\rangle_0$, where $\\langle T_x \\rangle_0$ is the kinetic energy in the underlying (unprojected) mean-field state. This implies that the total charge response, which is a measure of the ability of charges to respond to an electric field, is scaled by $g_t(x)$.\nThe total conductivity spectrum consists of a dissipationless part (the supercurrent) and an absorptive part (QP excitations):\n$$ \\sigma_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\pi D_s(x)}{2} \\delta(\\omega) + \\sigma_{xx}^{\\text{reg}}(\\omega) $$\nBoth parts of the charge response are subject to the same renormalization from correlations. Thus, the superfluid stiffness $D_s(x)$ must be directly proportional to the Gutzwiller factor $g_t(x)$. The constant of proportionality is the superfluid stiffness of the system in the absence of this specific correlation effect, which is the unrenormalized BCS stiffness $D_s^{(0)}$.\nThis physical argument, rooted in gauge invariance, supersedes the naive calculation and \"cures\" its incorrect dependence on powers of $g_t(x)$. It effectively shows that the complex interplay of vertex and self-energy corrections results in a simple scaling relation.\n\n**4. Final Expression and Low-Doping Scaling**\nBased on the gauge invariance argument, the full Meissner kernel (superfluid stiffness) factorizes as:\n$$ D_s(x) = g_t(x) D_s^{(0)} $$\nSubstituting the given form for the Gutzwiller factor, $g_t(x) = \\dfrac{2x}{1+x}$:\n$$ D_s(x) = \\frac{2x}{1+x} D_s^{(0)} $$\nThis is the final expression for the superfluid stiffness in terms of the hole doping $x$ and the unrenormalized stiffness $D_s^{(0)}$.\nFor low doping, $x \\ll 1$, the expression can be approximated as:\n$$ D_s(x) \\approx 2x D_s^{(0)} $$\nThis linear dependence on doping, $D_s(x) \\propto x$, is a hallmark result for the superfluid density in models of hole-doped cuprates starting from the Mott insulating state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D_{s}(x) = \\frac{2x}{1+x} D_{s}^{(0)}}$$", "id": "3020817"}]}
