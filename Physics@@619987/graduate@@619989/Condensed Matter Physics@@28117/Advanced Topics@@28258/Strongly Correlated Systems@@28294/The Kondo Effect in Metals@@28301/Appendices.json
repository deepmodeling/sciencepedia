The task is to derive the impurity contribution to resistivity in the low-temperature Kondo regime.\n\nThe solution is constructed by combining the Drude model of conductivity with the quantum mechanical theory of scattering.\n\nFirst, we begin with the provided givens. The impurity contribution to the electrical resistivity, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}$, is related to the momentum relaxation time due to impurity scattering, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}$, by the Drude formula:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T) = \\frac{m}{n e^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)}\n$$\nwhere $m$ is the quasiparticle effective mass, $n$ is the conduction electron density, and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe momentum relaxation rate, $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)$, for elastic scattering from a dilute concentration $n_i$ of random impurities is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T)} = n_i v_F \\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T)\n$$\nHere, $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T)$ is the transport cross section evaluated at the Fermi surface. The temperature dependence arises from the energy dependence of the scattering phase shifts near the Fermi surface, as captured by the temperature-dependent phase shift $\\delta_0(T)$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the relaxation rate into the Drude formula gives the resistivity in terms of the transport cross section:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T) = \\frac{m n_i v_F}{n e^2} \\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T)\n$$\n\nNext, we must express the transport cross section in terms of the scattering phase shifts. According to partial-wave analysis, the transport cross section for elastic scattering is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{4\\pi}{k^2} \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (l+1) \\sin^2(\\delta_l - \\delta_{l+1})\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the wave number of the scattered particle and $\\delta_l$ are the phase shifts for each angular momentum channel $l$. In this problem, scattering occurs at the Fermi surface, so we set $k = k_F$.\n\nThe problem states that at low temperatures, the scattering is dominated by the isotropic $s$-wave channel. This corresponds to the $l=0$ partial wave. We therefore set all other phase shifts to zero: $\\delta_l = 0$ for $l \\geq 1$. The summation for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ simplifies considerably:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{4\\pi}{k_F^2} \\left( (0+1)\\sin^2(\\delta_0 - \\delta_1) + (1+1)\\sin^2(\\delta_1 - \\delta_2) + \\dots \\right)\n$$\nWith $\\delta_1 = \\delta_2 = \\dots = 0$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}(T) = \\frac{4\\pi}{k_F^2} \\sin^2(\\delta_0(T) - 0) = \\frac{4\\pi}{k_F^2} \\sin^2(\\delta_0(T))\n$$\nThe temperature dependence of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ is carried by the $s$-wave phase shift $\\delta_0(T)$ at the Fermi surface.\n\nWe can now write the impurity resistivity explicitly in terms of the $s$-wave phase shift, as requested by the first part of the problem:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(T) = \\frac{m n_i v_F}{n e^2} \\left[ \\frac{4\\pi}{k_F^2} \\sin^2(\\delta_0(T)) \\right]\n$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to evaluate this expression in the zero-temperature limit, $T \\to 0$. The problem provides the result from the Friedel sum rule for a fully screened spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ impurity, which states that the phase shift at the Fermi level approaches $\\pi/2$:\n$$\n\\lim_{T \\to 0} \\delta_0(T) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the resistivity gives the residual resistivity $\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(0)$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(0) = \\frac{4\\pi m n_i v_F}{n e^2 k_F^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$, the term $\\sin^2(\\pi/2) = 1$. This value corresponds to the maximum possible scattering cross section for the $s$-wave channel, a condition known as the unitarity limit. The fact that the resistivity reaches a constant, maximum value determined by this limit demonstrates its saturation at low temperatures.\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(0) = \\frac{4\\pi m n_i v_F}{n e^2 k_F^2}\n$$\n\nFinally, the problem requires the answer to be expressed in terms of $n$, $n_i$, $e$, $\\hbar$, and $k_F$. The current expression contains the effective mass $m$ and the Fermi velocity $v_F$. These quantities are related to the Fermi wave number $k_F$ through the de Broglie relation for a quasiparticle at the Fermi surface. The Fermi momentum is $p_F = \\hbar k_F$. For a quasiparticle with effective mass $m$, the momentum is also $p_F = m v_F$. Equating these expressions allows us to write:\n$$\nv_F = \\frac{\\hbar k_F}{m}\n$$\nSubstituting this relation into the expression for $\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(0)$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(0) = \\frac{4\\pi m n_i}{n e^2 k_F^2} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar k_F}{m} \\right)\n$$\nThe effective mass $m$ cancels out, yielding the final expression for the saturated residual resistivity:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{imp}}(0) = \\frac{4\\pi \\hbar n_i}{n e^2 k_F}\n$$\nThis is the low-temperature unitarity-limited resistivity caused by a dilute concentration of fully screened Kondo impurities.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{4 \\pi \\hbar n_i}{n e^{2} k_F}}$$", "id": "3020102"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of the low-temperature ground state, this practice delves into the dynamics of the system just above absolute zero.
