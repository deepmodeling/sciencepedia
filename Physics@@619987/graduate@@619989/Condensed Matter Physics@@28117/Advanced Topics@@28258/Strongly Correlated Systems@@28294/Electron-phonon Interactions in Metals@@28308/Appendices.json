The derivation must proceed from the first principles of lattice dynamics.\n\nWe begin with the equation of motion for an atom at lattice site $\\mathbf{R}_n$. The atom has mass $M$ and its displacement from equilibrium is $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{R}_n)$. The model considers harmonic central forces between nearest neighbors, represented by springs of stiffness $K$. The force on the atom at $\\mathbf{R}_n$ is the sum of forces from its nearest neighbors.\n\nThe potential energy stored in the bond between the atom at $\\mathbf{R}_n$ and a nearest neighbor at $\\mathbf{R}_p = \\mathbf{R}_n + \\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}}$ is given by $U = \\frac{1}{2}K (\\delta L)^2$, where $\\delta L$ is the change in the bond length from its equilibrium value, $a$. For small displacements, the change in bond length is the projection of the relative displacement vector onto the bond direction: $\\delta L \\approx (\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{R}_p) - \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{R}_n)) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}}}{|\\mathbf{R}_{\\text{NN}}|}$.

Thus, all off-diagonal components of $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{q})$ are zero.\nThe dynamical matrix is diagonal:\n$$\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{q}) = 2K \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\cos(q_x a) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1-\\cos(q_y a) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1-\\cos(q_z a) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues of the system $M\\omega^2\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{q})\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ are the diagonal elements of $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{q})$. This gives three dispersion relations for the normal modes:\n$$M\\omega_1^2 = 2K(1 - \\cos(q_x a)) \\implies \\omega_1(\\mathbf{q}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}(1 - \\cos(q_x a))}$$\n$$M\\omega_2^2 = 2K(1 - \\cos(q_y a)) \\implies \\omega_2(\\mathbf{q}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}(1 - \\cos(q_y a))}$$\n$$M\\omega_3^2 = 2K(1 - \\cos(q_z a)) \\implies \\omega_3(\\mathbf{q}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}(1 - \\cos(q_z a))}$$\nThe corresponding eigenvectors are $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_1=(1,0,0)$, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_2=(0,1,0)$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_3=(0,0,1)$.\n\nWe are interested in the longitudinal acoustic mode along the $[100]$ crystallographic direction. This corresponds to a wave vector $\\mathbf{q} = (q, 0, 0)$. A longitudinal mode is one for which the polarization vector $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{q}$. For $\\mathbf{q}=(q,0,0)$, the longitudinal polarization is $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}=(1,0,0)$. This corresponds to the first mode, $\\omega_1$.\nSubstituting $q_x=q$, $q_y=0$, $q_z=0$ into the dispersion relations:\nFor the longitudinal mode:\n$$\\omega(q) = \\omega_1(q,0,0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}(1 - \\cos(qa))}$$\nThe other two modes are transverse, with $\\omega_2(q,0,0)=0$ and $\\omega_3(q,0,0)=0$. This is a known artifact of the nearest-neighbor central force model for simple cubic lattices, which yields no restoring force for certain transverse displacements.\n\nThe sound velocity $v_s$ is defined as the long-wavelength limit ($q \\to 0$) of the group velocity, $v_g = \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial q}$.\n$$v_s = \\lim_{q \\to 0} \\frac{\\partial \\omega(q)}{\\partial q}$$\nWe first compute the derivative of $\\omega(q)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q} \\left[ \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}} (1 - \\cos(qa))^{1/2} \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial q} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} (1 - \\cos(qa))^{-1/2} \\cdot (a \\sin(qa)) = a \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}} \\frac{\\sin(qa)}{2\\sqrt{1-\\cos(qa)}}$$\nUsing the trigonometric identities $\\sin(x) = 2\\sin(x/2)\\cos(x/2)$ and $1-\\cos(x) = 2\\sin^2(x/2)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial q} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}} \\frac{2\\sin(qa/2)\\cos(qa/2)}{2\\sqrt{2\\sin^2(qa/2)}} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}} \\frac{2\\sin(qa/2)\\cos(qa/2)}{2\\sqrt{2}|\\sin(qa/2)|}$$\nFor small $q>0$, $\\sin(qa/2)$ is positive, so $|\\sin(qa/2)| = \\sin(qa/2)$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial q} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{M}} \\frac{\\cos(qa/2)}{\\sqrt{2}} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{M}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{qa}{2}\\right)$$\nNow we take the limit as $q \\to 0$:\n$$v_s = \\lim_{q \\to 0} \\left[ a \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{M}} \\cos\\left(\\frac{qa}{2}\\right) \\right] = a \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{M}} \\cos(0) = a \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{M}}$$\nAlternatively, for small $q$, we can approximate the dispersion relation.

From this linear relation, we directly identify the sound velocity as $v_s = a \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{M}}$.\nThe final expression for the sound velocity is in terms of the given parameters $a$, $K$, and $M$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{a\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{M}}}$$"}, {"introduction": "Having established the properties of lattice vibrations, we now explore how they interact with conduction electrons, the dominant scattering mechanism that gives rise to electrical resistivity in pure metals.

The approximations (free electron model, linear phonon dispersion, high-T equipartition, quasi-elastic scattering) are standard and well-defined. Fermi's golden rule is the correct starting point. The formulas for the matrix element, `q` as a function of `theta`, and the transport relaxation time are all standard in solid-state physics. The problem is firmly grounded in condensed matter theory.\n        *   **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for a specific quantity, the transport relaxation time (`tau_tr`), and provides all the necessary starting points and ingredients to derive it.

There are no subjective elements.\n        *   **Completeness**: The problem provides the dispersion relations, the matrix element, the high-temperature approximation for the phonon occupation number, and the definition of the transport relaxation time integral. It also specifies that electrons are at the Fermi surface. This seems to be a self-contained and complete problem. The density of states at the Fermi level is not given explicitly, but must be derived from the electron dispersion, which is standard.\n        *   **Unrealistic/Infeasible**: The problem statement asks to \"Express the final transport relaxation time in seconds.\" This is a bit strange, as the a priori symbolic expression will have units of time, but not necessarily in seconds unless numerical values are plugged in. However, the problem also says \"NEVER substitute numerical values unless a final numerical answer is explicitly required by the problem.\" and \"Express your final result for the transport relaxation time tau_tr as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of D, m, kF, kB, T, rho, cs, and hbar.\" This seems to be a contradictory instruction. Let's analyze it more carefully. The global formatting rules state: \"NEVER substitute numerical values unless a final numerical answer is explicitly required by the problem.\" The problem statement itself asks for the final result as an analytical expression *and then* says \"Express the final transport relaxation time in seconds.\" This is a minor ambiguity. It likely means the final symbolic expression should have dimensions of time, which in SI units would be seconds. It does not imply a numerical calculation.

So we need to consider both processes. The total rate is the sum of absorption and emission rates.\n        *   Absorption: Electron `k` absorbs a phonon `q` to become `k'`. Here `k' = k + q`. Energy conservation: `ε_k' = ε_k + ħω_q`. The rate is proportional to `n_q`.\n        *   Emission: Electron `k` emits a phonon `q` to become `k'`. Here `k = k' + q` or `k' = k - q`. Energy conservation: `ε_k' = ε_k - ħω_q`. The rate is proportional to `1 + n_q`.\n\n    *   **Apply Approximations**:\n        *   **Quasi-elastic scattering**: `ε_k ≈ ε_k'`. This simplifies the delta function to `δ(ε_k' - ε_k)`. This is a common and important approximation. It means electron energy is conserved in the scattering event, which is reasonable since `ħω_q` is much smaller than `ε_F`.\n        *   **Matrix element**: $|M(\\boldsymbol{q})|^2 = D^2 \\hbar q / (2 \\rho V c_s)$.\n        *   **High-temperature equipartition**: `n_q ≈ k_B T / (ħω_q)`.

Rate proportional to `n_q + 1`.\n        Since `|q| = |-q|`, the matrix elements are the same: `|M(k'-k)|^2 = |M(k-k')|^2`.\n        The total rate of transition from `k` to `k'` is roughly:\n        $$ W_{\\boldsymbol{k} \\to \\boldsymbol{k}'} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} |M(\\boldsymbol{q})|^2 (n_q + (n_q+1)) \\delta(\\varepsilon_{\\boldsymbol{k}'} - \\varepsilon_{\\boldsymbol{k}}) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} |M(\\boldsymbol{q})|^2 (2n_q+1) \\delta(\\varepsilon_{\\boldsymbol{k}'} - \\varepsilon_{\\boldsymbol{k}}) $$ where `q = |k - k'|`.\n        In the high-T limit, `k_B T >> ħω_q`, so `n_q >> 1`.

Note that this rate appears independent of `q`. This is a key feature of the high-T limit.\n\n    *   **Calculate the differential scattering rate `W(θ)`**:\n        We need to sum over all final states `k'` that lie in a given solid angle `dΩ`. This gives the differential scattering rate `dW/dΩ`. The problem calls this `W(θ)`.\n        The total rate into `dΩ` is:\n        $$ dW = \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{k}' \\in d\\Omega} W_{\\boldsymbol{k} \\to \\boldsymbol{k}'} $$\n        Replace the sum with an integral:\n        $$ dW = \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int_{\\boldsymbol{k}' \\in d\\Omega} d^3k' W_{\\boldsymbol{k} \\to \\boldsymbol{k}'} $$\n        $$ dW = \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\int_{\\boldsymbol{k}' \\in d\\Omega} d^3k' \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} \\frac{D^2 k_B T}{\\rho V c_s^2} \\delta(\\varepsilon_{\\boldsymbol{k}'} - \\varepsilon_{\\boldsymbol{k}}) \\right) $$\n        $$ dW = \\frac{D^2 k_B T}{4\\pi^2 \\hbar \\rho c_s^2} \\int_{\\boldsymbol{k}' \\in d\\Omega} d^3k' \\delta(\\varepsilon_{\\boldsymbol{k}'} - \\varepsilon_{\\boldsymbol{k}}) $$\n        The initial state `k` is on the Fermi surface, so `ε_k = ε_F`. The delta function constrains the final states `k'` to also be on the Fermi surface.\n        Let's convert `d^3k'` to spherical coordinates: `d^3k' = k'^2 dk' dΩ'`. The integral is over a small solid angle, which we call `dΩ`.\n        $$ dW = \\frac{D^2 k_B T}{4\\pi^2 \\hbar \\rho c_s^2} \\int_{k'=0}^\\infty k'^2 dk' \\int_{d\\Omega} d\\Omega' \\delta(\\varepsilon(k') - \\varepsilon_F) $$\n        The solid angle integral just gives `dΩ`.\n        $$ \\frac{dW}{d\\Omega} = W(\\theta) = \\frac{D^2 k_B T}{4\\pi^2 \\hbar \\rho c_s^2} \\int_0^\\infty k'^2 \\delta(\\varepsilon(k') - \\varepsilon_F) dk' $$\n        Now we need to evaluate the integral over `k'`. We use the property of the delta function: `∫ g(x) δ(f(x)) dx = g(x_0)/|f'(x_0)|` where `f(x_0) = 0`.\n        Here, `f(k') = ε(k') - ε_F = ħ^2 k'^2 / (2m) - ε_F`. `f(k')=0` implies `k' = k_F`.\n        `f'(k') = dε/dk' = ħ^2 k' / m`. At `k' = k_F`, `f'(k_F) = ħ^2 k_F / m`.\n        The integral becomes:\n        $$ \\int_0^\\infty k'^2 \\delta(\\varepsilon(k') - \\varepsilon_F) dk' = \\frac{k_F^2}{|ħ^2 k_F / m|} = \\frac{m k_F}{\\hbar^2} $$\n        This integral is essentially the density of states at the Fermi surface, but per unit solid angle per unit volume. The total density of states at the Fermi level `g(ε_F)` is `V/(2π^2) * k_F^2 * (dk/dε)|_F = V/(2π^2) k_F^2 (m/ħ^2 k_F) = Vm k_F / (2π^2 ħ^2)`.\n        So the integral `∫... dk'` is `g(ε_F) / (V dΩ)`? Let's check. `d^3k' = k'^2 dk' dΩ`.\n        `∫ d^3k' δ(ε(k') - ε_F) = ∫ dΩ' ∫ k'^2 δ(ħ^2 k'^2/(2m) - ε_F) dk' = 4π * (m k_F / ħ^2)`.\n        So `∫ k'^2 δ(ε(k') - ε_F) dk' = m k_F / ħ^2`. This is correct.\n        This is the density of states per unit solid angle.\n        \n        So, the differential scattering rate is:\n        $$ W(\\theta) = \\frac{D^2 k_B T}{4\\pi^2 \\hbar \\rho c_s^2} \\left( \\frac{m k_F}{\\hbar^2} \\right) $$\n        $$ W(\\theta) = \\frac{m D^2 k_F k_B T}{4\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 \\rho c_s^2} $$\n        This scattering rate is independent of the scattering angle `θ`.\n\n    *   **Calculate the transport relaxation rate `1/τ_tr`**:\n        The definition is provided in the problem statement:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = \\int d\\Omega\\, W(\\theta)\\, (1 - \\cos \\theta) $$\n        The integral is over the full solid angle. In spherical coordinates, `dΩ = \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi`.\n        Since `W(θ)` is a constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = W(\\theta) \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi d\\theta \\, (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\sin\\theta $$\n        The integral over `dφ` provides a factor of `2π`.\n        $$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = 2\\pi W(\\theta) \\int_0^\\pi (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta $$\n        We evaluate the `θ` integral by substitution. Let `u = \\cos\\theta`, which means `du = -\\sin\\theta d\\theta`. The limits of integration change from `θ=0` to `u=1` and `θ=π` to `u=-1`.\n        $$ \\int_0^\\pi (1 - \\cos \\theta) \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\int_1^{-1} (1-u) (-du) = \\int_{-1}^1 (1-u) \\, du $$\n        $$ = \\left[ u - \\frac{u^2}{2} \\right]_{-1}^1 = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(-1 - \\frac{(-1)^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 2 $$\n        The full angular integral `∫(1-cosθ)dΩ` is `2π * 2 = 4π`.\n        Substituting this back into the expression for the transport relaxation rate:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = 4\\pi W(\\theta) $$\n        Now, we substitute the derived expression for `W(θ)`:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{m D^2 k_F k_B T}{4\\pi^2 \\hbar^3 \\rho c_s^2} \\right) $$\n        $$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = \\frac{m D^2 k_F k_B T}{\\pi \\hbar^3 \\rho c_s^2} $$\n        The problem asks for the transport relaxation time, `τ_tr`, which is the reciprocal of this rate.\n        $$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar^3 \\rho c_s^2}{m D^2 k_F k_B T} $$\n        This expression has dimensions of time.

The quantities $\\alpha^{2}F(\\omega)$, $\\lambda$, $\\omega_{\\ln}$, and $\\omega_{2}$ are standard in this field.

We begin from the standard integral definitions of these parameters.\n\n**1. Dimensionless Electron-Phonon Coupling Constant ($\\lambda$)**\n\nThe parameter $\\lambda$ is defined as twice the first inverse-frequency moment of the spectral function:\n$$ \\lambda = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha^{2}F(\\omega)}{\\omega} d\\omega $$\nSubstituting the given form of $\\alpha^{2}F(\\omega)$:\n$$ \\lambda = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A\\,\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_{E})}{\\omega} d\\omega $$\nWe use the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, which states that $\\int f(x)\\delta(x-a)dx = f(a)$ for a function $f(x)$ continuous at $x=a$. Here, the function is $f(\\omega) = A/\\omega$ and the point of evaluation is $\\omega = \\omega_{E}$. Since $\\omega_{E} > 0$, the singularity of the delta function is within the integration domain $[0, \\infty)$ and the function $1/\\omega$ is well-behaved at $\\omega_{E}$.\n$$ \\lambda = 2 A \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_{E})}{\\omega} d\\omega = 2A \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega_{E}} \\right) $$\nThus, the expression for $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{2A}{\\omega_{E}} $$\n\n**2. Logarithmic Average Phonon Frequency ($\\omega_{\\ln}$)**\n\nThe logarithmic average frequency $\\omega_{\\ln}$ is defined through its logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(\\omega_{\\ln}) = \\frac{2}{\\lambda} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha^{2}F(\\omega)}{\\omega} \\ln(\\omega) d\\omega $$\nEquivalently,\n$$ \\omega_{\\ln} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{2}{\\lambda} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha^{2}F(\\omega)}{\\omega} \\ln(\\omega) d\\omega \\right) $$\nFirst, we evaluate the integral:\n$$ I_{\\ln} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\alpha^{2}F(\\omega)}{\\omega} \\ln(\\omega) d\\omega = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A\\,\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_{E})}{\\omega} \\ln(\\omega) d\\omega $$\nApplying the sifting property of the delta function with the integrand function being $\\frac{A\\ln(\\omega)}{\\omega}$:\n$$ I_{\\ln} = A \\frac{\\ln(\\omega_{E})}{\\omega_{E}} $$\nNow, we substitute this result and the expression for $\\lambda$ into the definition of $\\omega_{\\ln}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\ln} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{2}{\\lambda} \\left( A \\frac{\\ln(\\omega_{E})}{\\omega_{E}} \\right) \\right) $$\nUsing our result for $\\lambda = \\frac{2A}{\\omega_{E}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\ln} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{2}{\\left(\\frac{2A}{\\omega_{E}}\\right)} \\left( A \\frac{\\ln(\\omega_{E})}{\\omega_{E}} \\right) \\right) = \\exp\\left( \\frac{2\\omega_{E}}{2A} \\cdot \\frac{A\\ln(\\omega_{E})}{\\omega_{E}} \\right) $$\nThe terms $2$, $A$, and $\\omega_{E}$ cancel in the exponent:\n$$ \\omega_{\\ln} = \\exp(\\ln(\\omega_{E})) $$\nTherefore, the logarithmic average frequency is simply the Einstein frequency:\n$$ \\omega_{\\ln} = \\omega_{E} $$\nThe units of this quantity are implicitly radians per second, as it is an angular frequency.\n\n**3. Square-Root Second Moment Frequency ($\\omega_{2}$)**\n\nThe frequency $\\omega_{2}$ is defined as the square root of the normalized second moment of the spectral function:\n$$ \\omega_{2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 2 \\omega \\alpha^{2}F(\\omega) d\\omega \\right)^{1/2} $$\nLet us first evaluate the integral part:\n$$ I_{2} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 2 \\omega \\alpha^{2}F(\\omega) d\\omega = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 2 \\omega \\left( A\\,\\delta(\\omega-\\omega_{E}) \\right) d\\omega $$\nApplying the sifting property of the delta function with the integrand function being $2A\\omega$:\n$$ I_{2} = 2 A \\omega_{E} $$\nNow, we substitute this integral and the expression for $\\lambda$ into the definition of $\\omega_{2}$:\n$$ \\omega_{2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda} (2 A \\omega_{E}) \\right)^{1/2} $$\nUsing $\\lambda = \\frac{2A}{\\omega_{E}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{2} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{2A}{\\omega_{E}}\\right)} (2 A \\omega_{E}) \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{E}}{2A} \\cdot 2 A \\omega_{E} \\right)^{1/2} $$\nThe terms $2$ and $A$ cancel inside the parenthesis:\n$$ \\omega_{2} = \\left( \\omega_{E} \\cdot \\omega_{E} \\right)^{1/2} = \\left( \\omega_{E}^{2} \\right)^{1/2} $$\nSince it is given that $\\omega_{E} > 0$, the square root is unambiguous:\n$$ \\omega_{2} = \\omega_{E} $$\nThe units of this quantity are also implicitly radians per second.\n\nIn summary, for an Einstein phonon spectrum, both characteristic average frequencies, $\\omega_{\\ln}$ and $\\omega_{2}$, are identically equal to the Einstein frequency $\\omega_{E}$. The coupling constant $\\lambda$ is proportional to the spectral weight $A$ and inversely proportional to the frequency $\\omega_E$.\nThe final derived expressions are:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{2A}{\\omega_{E}}$\n$\\omega_{\\ln} = \\omega_{E}$\n$\\omega_{2} = \\omega_{E}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{2A}{\\omega_{E}} & \\omega_{E} & \\omega_{E}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$"}]}
