The analysis begins with the provided Hamiltonian.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for non-interacting electrons on a lattice can be written in a general form as $H = \\sum_{i,j,\\sigma} t_{ij} c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{j\\sigma}$, where $t_{ij}$ represents the hopping integral for an electron moving from site $j$ to site $i$. The problem statement provides the Hamiltonian in a specific form:\n$$\nH = -t \\sum_{\\langle i j\\rangle,\\sigma} (c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{j\\sigma} + \\mathrm{h.c.})\n$$\nwhere $t > 0$ is the hopping amplitude between nearest-neighbor sites, denoted by $\\langle i j \\rangle$. The term `h.c.` stands for the hermitian conjugate, so $(c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{j\\sigma})^{\\dagger} = c_{j\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{i\\sigma}$. The full Hamiltonian is therefore symmetric with respect to interchange of site indices $i$ and $j$:\n$$\nH = -t \\sum_{\\langle i j\\rangle,\\sigma} (c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{j\\sigma} + c_{j\\sigma}^{\\dagger}c_{i\\sigma})\n$$\nThis expression can be mapped to the general form $H = \\sum_{i,j,\\sigma} t_{ij} c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{j\\sigma}$ by defining $t_{ij} = -t$ if sites $i$ and $j$ are nearest neighbors, and $t_{ij}=0$ otherwise. Note that $t_{ii}=0$ as there is no on-site hopping term.\n\nThe system possesses translational invariance, which makes it advantageous to work in momentum space. We introduce the discrete Fourier transform for the electron operators:\n$$\nc_{i\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_i} c_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} e^{-i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_i} c_{\\mathbf{k}\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of lattice sites, $\\mathbf{R}_i$ is the position vector of site $i$, and $\\mathbf{k}$ is the crystal momentum vector within the first Brillouin zone.

The maximum value of $\\cos(\\theta)$ is $1$, which occurs when $\\theta = 2n\\pi$ for any integer $n$.

Due to the translational invariance of the lattice, the ground-state expectation value $\\langle \\hat{n}_{i\\uparrow}\\hat{n}_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle$ is independent of the site index $i$.

Unoccupied ($|0\\rangle$): $n_{i\\uparrow}=0$, $n_{i\\downarrow}=0$. Energy $E_0 = 0$.\n$2$.

Doubly occupied ($|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle$): $n_{i\\uparrow}=1$, $n_{i\\downarrow}=1$. Energy $E_2 = U(1) - \\mu(2) = U - 2\\mu$.\n\nThe problem states that the chemical potential $\\mu$ is chosen to enforce half-filling, meaning the average number of electrons per site is $1$. At zero temperature ($T=0$), the system occupies the lowest energy state(s). For the average occupancy to be $1$, the ground state of each site must be the singly occupied state. This requires the energy $E_1$ to be lower than both $E_0$ and $E_2$.\n- $E_1 < E_0 \\implies -\\mu < 0 \\implies \\mu > 0$.\n- $E_1 < E_2 \\implies -\\mu < U - 2\\mu \\implies \\mu < U$.\nThus, for any chemical potential in the range $0 < \\mu < U$ (with $U>0$), the ground state of each site is singly occupied. For instance, setting $\\mu = U/2$ yields $E_1 = -U/2$ while $E_0 = 0$ and $E_2 = U - 2(U/2) = 0$, making the singly occupied states the unique ground states.\nIn this ground state, every site contains exactly one electron. Therefore, for any site $i$ in the ground state configuration, the number of electrons is either ($n_{i\\uparrow}=1$, $n_{i\\downarrow}=0$) or ($n_{i\\uparrow}=0$, $n_{i\\downarrow}=1$). In either case, the product $n_{i\\uparrow}n_{i\\downarrow}$ is $0$.\nThe eigenvalue of the operator $\\hat{n}_{i\\uparrow}\\hat{n}_{i\\downarrow}$ is $0$ for any state in the ground-state manifold. Consequently, its expectation value is also zero:\n$$\n\\langle \\hat{n}_{i\\uparrow}\\hat{n}_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle = 0\n$$\nThis leads to the double occupancy in the atomic limit:\n$$\nD|_{t=0} = 0\n$$\n\nPhysical difference between the two limits:\n\nIn the noninteracting limit ($U=0$, $t>0$), the kinetic energy (hopping) dominates. Electrons are itinerant and delocalized over the entire lattice, described by Bloch waves. The absence of Coulomb repulsion ($U=0$) means the presence of a spin-up electron on a site has no influence on a spin-down electron. Their occupations are statistically independent, leading to a finite probability ($D = 1/4$) of finding two electrons on the same site, purely by chance.\n\nIn contrast, in the atomic limit ($t=0$, $U>0$), the on-site Coulomb repulsion dominates and kinetic energy is quenched. Electrons are localized on specific lattice sites. The large energy cost $U$ for double occupancy makes it energetically prohibitive for two electrons to reside on the same site. To minimize the total energy at half-filling, the system adopts a configuration with exactly one electron per site. This completely suppresses double occupancy ($D=0$) and results in the formation of well-defined local magnetic moments (one spin-$1/2$ per site), which are orientationally disordered in the paramagnetic phase.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3019516"}]}
