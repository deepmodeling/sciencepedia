This first exercise guides you through the foundational calculation, focusing on a key variational parameter: the probability of double occupancy, $d$. By constructing and minimizing the Gutzwiller energy functional, you will quantitatively derive how the on-site repulsion $U$ penalizes charge fluctuations, leading to the suppression of doubly occupied sites and predicting the critical interaction strength for the Mott transition [@problem_id:2974400].", "problem": "Consider the single-band Hubbard model at half-filling in the paramagnetic phase, described by the Hamiltonian $H = \\sum_{i,j,\\sigma} t_{ij}\\, c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{j\\sigma} + U \\sum_{i} n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow}$, where $c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}$ and $c_{i\\sigma}$ are electron creation and annihilation operators on site $i$ with spin $\\sigma$, $t_{ij}$ is the hopping amplitude, and $U$ is the on-site repulsion.

It is a standard problem in condensed matter theory concerning the Mott transition within the Hubbard model, addressed using the Gutzwiller approximation as pioneered by Brinkman and Rice. All provided information is self-consistent and sufficient for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem is solved in two parts: first, the calculation of the double occupancy in the noninteracting limit, and second, the calculation of the double occupancy as a function of interaction strength $U$ within the Brinkman-Rice-Gutzwiller framework.\n\nPart 1: Noninteracting Double Occupancy, $d_0$\n\nThe double occupancy per site, $d$, is defined as the expectation value $d \\equiv \\langle n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle$, where $n_{i\\sigma} = c_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger} c_{i\\sigma}$ is the number operator for an electron of spin $\\sigma$ on site $i$.\n\nIn the noninteracting case ($U=0$), the ground state is a single Slater determinant formed by filling the lowest energy single-particle states. For a paramagnetic system, the spin-up and spin-down electrons form independent Fermi seas. Consequently, the event of finding a spin-up electron at a site is statistically independent of finding a spin-down electron at the same site. The expectation value of the product of the number operators thus factorizes:\n$$\nd_0 = \\langle n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle_{U=0} = \\langle n_{i\\uparrow} \\rangle_{U=0} \\langle n_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle_{U=0}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a half-filled band, which means the average total electron number per site is $n=1$.\n$$\nn = \\langle n_{i\\uparrow} + n_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle = \\langle n_{i\\uparrow} \\rangle + \\langle n_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle = 1\n$$\nIn a paramagnetic and spin-degenerate system, the average occupancy for each spin species must be equal:\n$$\n\\langle n_{i\\uparrow} \\rangle = \\langle n_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle\n$$\nCombining these two conditions, we find:\n$$\n2 \\langle n_{i\\uparrow} \\rangle = 1 \\implies \\langle n_{i\\uparrow} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nAnd therefore, $\\langle n_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}$ as well.\n\nSubstituting these values into the factorized expression for $d_0$:\n$$\nd_0 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Double Occupancy in the Brinkman-Rice Picture, $d(U)$\n\nThe Brinkman-Rice picture employs a Gutzwiller variational approach. The total energy per site, $E(d)$, is constructed as a function of the variational parameter $d$, the double occupancy. The energy functional consists of the renormalized kinetic energy and the potential energy due to on-site repulsion:\n$$\nE(d) = q(d) E_0 + U d\n$$\nHere, $E_0$ is the noninteracting kinetic energy per site (given as $E_0 < 0$), $U d$ is the interaction energy per site, and $q(d)$ is the Gutzwiller band-narrowing factor, which quantifies the reduction of kinetic energy due to correlations that suppress charge fluctuations.\n\nFor a half-filled ($n=1$) paramagnetic system, in the limit of large lattice coordination (as assumed in the Gutzwiller approximation), the band-narrowing factor $q(d)$ has a well-established form. This form can be derived by considering the probabilities of local configurations on a site allowing for an electron to hop. At half-filling, the probability of a site being empty must equal the probability of it being doubly occupied to maintain particle-hole symmetry, i.e., $\\nu_0 = d$. The probability of single occupancy is $\\nu_s = 1 - 2d$. The resulting band-narrowing factor is:\n$$\nq(d) = 8d(1-2d)\n$$\nThis factor correctly captures the physics in the two limits:\n1.  Noninteracting limit: $d = d_0 = 1/4$. Then $q(1/4) = 8(1/4)(1 - 2(1/4)) = 2(1/2) = 1$. The kinetic energy is unrenormalized, as expected.\n2.  Strongly correlated limit (Mott insulator): $d \\to 0$. Then $q(d) \\to 0$. The kinetic energy is completely suppressed as charge fluctuations are frozen out. The valid range for $d$ is $0 \\le d \\le 1/4$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $q(d)$ into the energy functional gives:\n$$\nE(d) = 8d(1-2d)E_0 + U d\n$$\nTo find the equilibrium double occupancy $d(U)$, we minimize $E(d)$ with respect to $d$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E(d)}{\\partial d} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d} (8d E_0 - 16d^2 E_0 + U d) = 8E_0 - 32d E_0 + U = 0\n$$\nSolving for $d$:\n$$\n32d E_0 = 8E_0 + U\n$$\n$$\nd(U) = \\frac{8E_0 + U}{32E_0} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{U}{32E_0}\n$$\nSince it is given that $E_0 < 0$, we can write $E_0 = -|E_0|$ to make the physical dependence clearer:\n$$\nd(U) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{32|E_0|}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the double occupancy decreases linearly with increasing repulsion $U$ from its noninteracting value of $d_0 = 1/4$.\n\nThe Mott transition occurs at a critical interaction strength $U_c$ where the double occupancy vanishes, signaling the localization of electrons and the opening of a charge gap. We find $U_c$ by setting $d(U_c) = 0$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U_c}{32|E_0|}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{U_c}{32|E_0|} = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies U_c = \\frac{32|E_0|}{4} = 8|E_0|\n$$\nThis is the famous Brinkman-Rice result for the critical interaction.\n\nFinally, we express the double occupancy $d(U)$ in terms of the ratio $U/U_c$. From the expression for $d(U)$, we have $\\frac{U}{32|E_0|} = \\frac{U}{4 U_c}$. Substituting this back, we obtain:\n$$\nd(U) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{4U_c} = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(1 - \\frac{U}{U_c}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for the metallic phase, $0 \\le U \\le U_c$. For $U > U_c$, the double occupancy is zero.\n\nThe problem requests the analytic expressions for $d_0$ and $d(U)$.\n\nThe noninteracting double occupancy is $d_0 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe interacting double occupancy is $d(U) = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(1 - \\frac{U}{U_c}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{4}\\left(1 - \\frac{U}{U_c}\\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2974400"}, {"introduction": "A powerful theoretical concept like the quasiparticle weight, $Z$, becomes truly meaningful when linked to experimentally measurable quantities.

Theoretical Derivation of the Critical Interaction $U_c$\n\nWe begin with the variational ground-state energy per site, $E$, for the single-band Hubbard model at half-filling, as described by the Gutzwiller approximation. The energy is a function of the fraction of doubly occupied sites, $d$:\n$$ E(d) = q(d) E_0 + U d $$\nHere, $U$ is the on-site Hubbard repulsion, and $E_0$ is the kinetic energy per site of the non-interacting ($U=0$) system at half-filling. The term $q(d)$ is the kinetic energy renormalization factor, which captures the reduction in band energy due to correlation effects that hinder electron hopping.\n\nFor a system at half-filling, the Gutzwiller approximation provides a specific form for this renormalization factor:\n$$ q(d) = 8d(1-2d) $$\nThis relation is a cornerstone of the Brinkman-Rice theory. Substituting this into the energy functional gives:\n$$ E(d) = 8d(1-2d)E_0 + Ud $$\nTo find the optimal fraction of double occupancies for a given interaction strength $U$, we minimize the energy $E(d)$ with respect to the variational parameter $d$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial E(d)}{\\partial d} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d} [8dE_0 - 16d^2E_0 + Ud] = 8E_0 - 32dE_0 + U = 0 $$\nSolving for $d$ yields:\n$$ 32dE_0 = 8E_0 + U \\implies d = \\frac{8E_0 + U}{32E_0} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{U}{32E_0} $$\nThe non-interacting kinetic energy $E_0$ is the ground-state energy of the Fermi sea, so it is inherently negative. We can write $E_0 = -|E_0|$, which gives:\n$$ d = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{32|E_0|} $$\nThis equation shows that for $U=0$, we recover the non-interacting result $d=1/4$. As $U$ increases, $d$ decreases, reflecting the energy penalty for double occupancy.\n\nThe Brinkman-Rice model describes a metal-insulator transition where, at a critical interaction strength $U_c$, charge fluctuations are completely suppressed. This corresponds to the vanishing of double occupancy, i.e., $d=0$. At this point, each site is occupied by exactly one electron, and the system becomes a Mott insulator. Setting $d=0$ in our expression for $d$ allows us to solve for $U_c$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U_c}{32|E_0|} $$\n$$ \\frac{U_c}{32|E_0|} = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies U_c = \\frac{32}{4}|E_0| = 8|E_0| $$\nThis is the celebrated result for the critical interaction in the Brinkman-Rice picture. The problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $u_c \\equiv U_c/|t|$, where $t$ is the hopping amplitude. Substituting our result for $U_c$:\n$$ u_c = \\frac{8|E_0|}{|t|} $$\n\n### 2. Numerical Estimation of $E_0$ and $u_c$\n\nThe next step is to compute the non-interacting kinetic energy per site, $E_0$.

Let's define a dimensionless integral $K_0$:\n$$ K_0 = \\frac{4}{4\\pi^2} \\iint_{\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y > 0} (\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y)\\,\\mathrm{d}k_x\\,\\mathrm{d}k_y $$\n- If $t>0$, then $t=|t|$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} < 0$ when $\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y > 0$.\n  $$ E_0 = \\frac{2}{4\\pi^2} \\iint_{\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y>0} -2|t|(\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y)\\,\\mathrm{d}k_x\\,\\mathrm{d}k_y = -|t| K_0 $$\n- If $t<0$, then $t=-|t|$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} < 0$ when $\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y < 0$.\n  $$ E_0 = \\frac{2}{4\\pi^2} \\iint_{\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y<0} 2|t|(\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y)\\,\\mathrm{d}k_x\\,\\mathrm{d}k_y $$\n  Due to the symmetry of the Brillouin zone and the integrand, $\\int_{\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y<0} (\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k} = -\\int_{\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y>0} (\\cos k_x+\\cos k_y)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{k}$. Thus, $E_0 = -|t| K_0$ in this case as well.\n\nIn all cases, $|E_0| = |t|K_0$, which means $|E_0|/|t| = K_0$. The ratio is a constant that depends only on the lattice structure, not on the sign or magnitude of $t$. The dimensionless critical interaction is therefore:\n$$ u_c = \\frac{8|E_0|}{|t|} = 8K_0 $$\nOur task reduces to computing $K_0$ numerically. The problem specifies a Riemann sum on a uniform $N \\times N$ grid, where $k_\\alpha=-\\pi+\\frac{2\\pi}{N}i_\\alpha$ and the area element is $\\Delta k_x \\Delta k_y = (\\frac{2\\pi}{N})^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{N^2}$.\n$$ K_0 \\approx \\frac{4}{4\\pi^2} \\sum_{i_x=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{i_y=0}^{N-1} (\\cos k_{i_x} + \\cos k_{i_y}) \\cdot \\Theta(\\cos k_{i_x} + \\cos k_{i_y}) \\cdot \\frac{4\\pi^2}{N^2} $$\n$$ K_0 \\approx \\frac{4}{N^2} \\sum_{i_x, i_y \\text{ s.t. } \\cos k_{i_x}+\\cos k_{i_y}>0} (\\cos k_{i_x} + \\cos k_{i_y}) $$\nThe computation of $u_c$ will thus depend only on the grid size $N$, not on the specific value of $t$. This implies that test cases B and C must yield identical results.\n\nThe numerical algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For a given grid size $N$, generate the {$k_x, k_y$} points.\n2.  For each point $(\\mathbf{k})$, compute $C = \\cos k_x + \\cos k_y$.\n3.  Sum up all values of $C$ for which $C > 0$.\n4.  Calculate $K_0$ using the formula above.\n5.  Compute $u_c = 8K_0$.\nThis procedure is implemented for each test case.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the dimensionless critical interaction u_c = U_c/|t| in the\n    Brinkman-Rice picture for a 2D square lattice Hubbard model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # (t, N)\n        (1.0, 801),  # Case A\n        (2.5, 401),  # Case B\n        (-1.0, 401), # Case C\n        (1.0, 21),   # Case D\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    \n    # Cache results for N to avoid re-computation for cases B and C.\n    uc_cache = {}\n\n    for t, N in test_cases:\n        if N in uc_cache:\n            results.append(uc_cache[N])\n            continue\n            \n        # The derivation u_c = 8 * |E_0|/|t| shows that the result only depends\n        # on the lattice structure and the numerical grid size N, not the\n        # value or sign of the hopping parameter t.\n\n        # 1.
