For a 2D superconducting thin film, these defects are vortices and antivortices.\n\nConsider a large, circular 2D superconducting film of radius $R$. A single vortex excitation in this film is characterized by a \"core\" of radius $\\xi$ (the superconducting coherence length) where the superconducting order parameter is suppressed, and circulating supercurrents outside the core. The energy required to create such a vortex depends on the system size and is given by:\n$$E_v = \\pi \\rho_s(T) \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{\\xi}\\right)$$\nHere, $\\rho_s(T)$ is the temperature-dependent superfluid stiffness (also known as phase stiffness), which characterizes the energy cost of twisting the phase of the superconducting order parameter.\n\nThe creation of a single vortex also has an associated configurational entropy. Since the vortex core, of effective area $\\xi^2$, can be placed anywhere within the film's area $A = \\pi R^2$, the entropy is given by the Boltzmann formula $S_v = k_B \\ln(\\Omega)$, where $\\Omega$ is the number of available microstates.
