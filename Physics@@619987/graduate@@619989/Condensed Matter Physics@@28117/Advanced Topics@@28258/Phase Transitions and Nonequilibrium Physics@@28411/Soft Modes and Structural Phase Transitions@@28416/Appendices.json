The problem specifies the form in the absence of an external field as $F[\\eta]=F_{0}+\\frac{1}{2}a(T)\\eta^{2}+\\frac{1}{4}b\\,\\eta^{4}$. An external field $h$ is introduced that is conjugate to the order parameter $\\eta$ and breaks the $\\eta \\to -\\eta$ symmetry. This requires a linear coupling term in the free energy.
