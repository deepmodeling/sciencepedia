Let the dimension of a quantity $A$ be denoted by $[A]$.\n\n$1$. **Dimensions of Spacetime and Derivatives**\n\nThe problem specifies an anisotropic scaling between imaginary time $\\tau$ and space $\\mathbf{x}$, given by $\\tau \\to b^{z} \\tau$ and $\\mathbf{x} \\to b \\mathbf{x}$. This implies a relationship between the dimensions of time and space. Let us assign the dimension of momentum to be $[p]=1$. A spatial coordinate $x_i$ has the dimension of inverse momentum, so $[\\mathbf{x}] = -1$.\nThe scaling relation $\\tau \\sim |\\mathbf{x}|^z$ implies that the dimension of time is related to the dimension of space as $[\\tau] = z[\\mathbf{x}] = -z$.\nConsequently, the temporal and spatial derivatives have dimensions:\n-   Spatial derivative: $[\\nabla] = [\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}] = -[\\mathbf{x}] = 1$.\n-   Temporal derivative: $[\\partial_{\\tau}] = [\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau}] = -[\\tau] = z$.\n\n$2$. **Dimensionality of the Action and Lagrangian Density**\n\nThe action $S$ is given by an integral over $d$ spatial dimensions and one time dimension:\n$$\nS[\\phi] \\;=\\; \\int d^{d}\\mathbf{x}\\, d\\tau \\, \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{density}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{density}}$ is the Lagrangian density. For the action $S$ to be dimensionless, $[S] = 0$, the dimension of the Lagrangian density must compensate for the dimension of the integration measure $d^d\\mathbf{x} d\\tau$.\nThe dimension of the integration measure is:\n$$\n[d^{d}\\mathbf{x}\\, d\\tau] = d[\\mathbf{x}] + [\\tau] = d(-1) + (-z) = -(d+z)\n$$\nTherefore, the Lagrangian density must have the dimension:\n$$\n[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{density}}] = -[d^{d}\\mathbf{x}\\, d\\tau] = d+z\n$$\n\n$3$. **Engineering Dimension of the Field $\\phi$**\n\nThe Lagrangian density is given by $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{density}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\, \\phi\\, \\mathcal{L}(\\partial_{\\tau},\\nabla)\\, \\phi + \\frac{u}{4!}\\, \\phi^{4}$. We determine the dimension of the field $\\phi$ from the quadratic (Gaussian) part of the action, $S_2 = \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} d\\tau \\frac{1}{2} \\phi \\mathcal{L} \\phi$. By convention in field theory, the field is normalized such that the coefficient of the spatial stiffness term is unity. The spatial stiffness is encoded in the $\\nabla$ dependence of the kernel $\\mathcal{L}$. The simplest such term is proportional to $(\\nabla \\phi)^2$. The dimension of this term within the Lagrangian density is:\n$$\n[(\\nabla \\phi)^2] = 2[\\nabla] + 2[\\phi] = 2(1) + 2[\\phi] = 2 + 2[\\phi]\n$$\nAt the Gaussian fixed point, all terms in the Lagrangian density must have the same dimension, which we found to be $d+z$. Equating the dimension of the $(\\nabla \\phi)^2$ term to this value yields:\n$$\n2 + 2[\\phi] = d+z\n$$\nSolving for the engineering dimension of the field $\\phi$, we get:\n$$\n[\\phi] = \\frac{d+z-2}{2}\n$$\n\n$4$. **Engineering Dimension of the Coupling $u$**\n\nNext, we determine the dimension of the quartic coupling $u$ by analyzing the interaction term in the Lagrangian density, $\\frac{u}{4!} \\phi^4$. This term must also have the dimension of the Lagrangian density, $d+z$.\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{u}{4!} \\phi^4\\right] = [u] + 4[\\phi] = d+z\n$$\nSubstituting the derived dimension of $\\phi$:\n$$\n[u] + 4 \\left( \\frac{d+z-2}{2} \\right) = d+z\n$$\n$$\n[u] + 2(d+z-2) = d+z\n$$\n$$\n[u] + 2(d+z) - 4 = d+z\n$$\nSolving for the engineering dimension of $u$:\n$$\n[u] = (d+z) - 2(d+z) + 4 = 4 - (d+z)\n$$\n\n$5$. **Upper Critical Dimension $d_{\\text{c}}^{+}$**\n\nThe upper critical dimension, $d_{\\text{c}}^{+}$, is defined as the spatial dimension at which the interaction coupling $u$ becomes marginal at the Gaussian fixed point. A marginal operator has an engineering dimension of zero.\nSetting $[u]=0$:\n$$\n0 = 4 - (d_{\\text{c}}^{+} + z)\n$$\nSolving for $d_{\\text{c}}^{+}$ gives:\n$$\nd_{\\text{c}}^{+} = 4-z\n$$\n\n$6$. **Relevance of the Quartic Interaction**\n\nThe sign of the engineering dimension $[u]$ determines the relevance of the quartic interaction in a perturbative Renormalization Group (RG) analysis around the Gaussian fixed point. The total effective dimension of the system can be thought of as $D_{\\text{eff}} = d+z$. The dimension of the coupling is then $[u] = 4 - D_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\n-   If $[u] > 0$ (i.e., $d+z < 4$), the coupling constant has a positive mass/momentum dimension. Under RG flow towards low energies (long wavelengths), the coupling grows. The interaction is considered **relevant**, and the Gaussian fixed point is unstable.\n-   If $[u] < 0$ (i.e., $d+z > 4$), the coupling constant has a negative mass/momentum dimension. Under RG flow towards low energies, the coupling diminishes and flows to zero. The interaction is considered **irrelevant**. In this regime, the physics is controlled by the Gaussian fixed point, and the non-linear interaction term can be treated as a small perturbation. Therefore, for $d+z>4$, the quartic interaction is perturbatively irrelevant.\n-   If $[u] = 0$ (i.e., $d+z=4$), the coupling is **marginal**. Its behavior under RG flow is determined by higher-order corrections. This condition defines the upper critical dimension.\n\nThe problem asks to explain why for $d+z>4$ the interaction is perturbatively irrelevant. As derived, when the condition $d+z>4$ holds, the engineering dimension of the coupling is $[u] = 4-(d+z) < 0$. A coupling with a negative momentum dimension shrinks under RG transformations towards the infrared (low energy). This means that at large length scales and low energies, the effect of this interaction becomes negligible compared to the terms in the Gaussian part of the action. The theory is said to be \"trivial\" in the infrared, and its critical exponents are given by their mean-field values. This justifies treating the interaction as a small perturbation, hence it is perturbatively irrelevant.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4-z}$$", "id": "3011716"}, {"introduction": "The abstract scaling relations derived from the field theory have concrete, measurable consequences for a system's thermodynamic properties.

The problem specifies $z=2$ for an overdamped bosonic mode.\n\n(a) To find the temperature dependence of $f_s(T)$ at criticality ($r=0$), we set $r=0$ in the scaling equation.

A standard technique in scaling theory is to choose the rescaling factor $b$ to fix one of the arguments of the function on the right-hand side. We choose $b$ such that the thermal energy scale $k_B T$ matches the characteristic energy scale of the system, which is determined by the argument of the scaling function. We set the first argument to unity:\n$$\nT b^{z} = 1 \\implies b = T^{-1/z}\n$$\nSubstituting this choice of $b$ back into the scaling equation yields:\n$$\nf_{s}(T,u) = \\left(T^{-1/z}\\right)^{-(d+z)} f_{s}\\!\\left(1,\\, 0,\\, u\\, \\left(T^{-1/z}\\right)^{y_u}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf_{s}(T,u) = T^{(d+z)/z} f_{s}\\!\\left(1,\\, 0,\\, u T^{-y_u/z}\\right)\n$$\nThe behavior of $f_s(T)$ as $T \\to 0$ now depends on the sign of the exponent $y_u$.\n- If $y_u < 0$, the coupling $u$ is an irrelevant perturbation in the RG sense. As $T \\to 0$, the exponent $-y_u/z$ is positive, so the argument $u T^{-y_u/z}$ flows to $0$. The physics is controlled by the non-interacting Gaussian fixed point ($u=0$). The scaling function $f_{s}(1, 0, u T^{-y_u/z})$ approaches a constant value, $f_s(1,0,0)$.

Thus, the temperature dependence of $\\alpha$ at the QCP is:\n$$\n\\alpha(0,T) \\sim T^{\\frac{d\\nu - 1}{\\nu z}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the GrÃ¼neisen ratio, $\\Gamma = \\alpha/C$. Using the temperature dependencies derived above:\n$$\n\\Gamma(0,T) \\sim \\frac{\\alpha(0,T)}{C(0,T)} \\sim \\frac{T^{\\frac{d\\nu - 1}{\\nu z}}}{T^{\\frac{d}{z}}} = T^{\\frac{d\\nu - 1}{\\nu z} - \\frac{d}{z}} = T^{\\frac{d\\nu - 1 - d\\nu}{\\nu z}} = T^{-\\frac{1}{\\nu z}}\n$$\n\nThe result holds under the following key assumptions:\n1.  The thermodynamics in the quantum critical region are dominated by the singular part of the free energy, $f_s$, such that contributions from any regular (analytic) background part are negligible.\n2.  The singular free energy obeys the stated scaling form $f_{s}(r,T)\\sim T^{(d+z)/z}\\,\\Phi(r/T^{1/\\nu z})$.\n3.  The scaling function $\\Phi(x)$ and its derivatives are well-behaved at $x=0$. Specifically, for the specific heat and thermal expansion to be singular, we require $\\Phi(0) \\neq 0$ and $\\Phi'(0) \\neq 0$. The non-vanishing of $\\Phi'(0)$ is crucial for the divergence of the GrÃ¼neisen ratio.\n\nThe derived temperature dependence shows that the GrÃ¼neisen ratio diverges as $T \\to 0$ at the quantum critical point, which is a key signature of quantum criticality.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{T^{-\\frac{1}{\\nu z}}}\n$$", "id": "3011644"}]}
