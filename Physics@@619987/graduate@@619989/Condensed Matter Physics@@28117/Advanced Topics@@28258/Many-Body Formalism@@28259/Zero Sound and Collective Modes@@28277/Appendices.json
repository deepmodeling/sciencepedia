It is based on standard, well-established principles of Landau Fermi liquid theory in condensed matter physics. All terms are formally defined, and the tasks are unambiguous. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the imaginary part of the dimensionless function $\\Phi(s + i 0^{+})$ for $|s| < 1$. The function is defined as:\n$$\n\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) \\equiv \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{u}{s - u + i 0^{+}} \\, du\n$$\nwhere $s \\equiv \\omega / (v_{F} k)$ is the dimensionless phase velocity, $u \\equiv \\cos\\theta$ is the directional cosine, and the $i 0^{+}$ term ensures a retarded causal response.\n\nTo evaluate the integral involving the infinitesimal imaginary part in the denominator, we employ the Sokhotskiâ€“Plemelj theorem, which states that for a real variable $x$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{1}{x \\pm i\\epsilon} = \\mathcal{P}\\frac{1}{x} \\mp i\\pi\\delta(x)\n$$\nHere, $\\mathcal{P}$ denotes the Cauchy principal value and $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nApplying this theorem to the integrand with the variable $x = s - u$ and the infinitesimal term $+i0^{+}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{s - u + i 0^{+}} = \\mathcal{P}\\frac{1}{s - u} - i\\pi\\delta(s - u)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $\\Phi(s + i 0^{+})$ yields:\n$$\n\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} u \\left( \\mathcal{P}\\frac{1}{s - u} - i\\pi\\delta(s - u) \\right) du\n$$\nThis expression can be separated into its real and imaginary parts:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathcal{P} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{u}{s - u} \\, du\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} u (-\\pi\\delta(s - u)) \\, du\n$$\nWe are tasked with calculating the imaginary part. Let's focus on this integral:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} u \\, \\delta(s - u) \\, du\n$$\nThe integral involves the Dirac delta function $\\delta(s - u)$, which is non-zero only when its argument is zero, i.e., when $u = s$. The sifting property of the delta function states that for a function $f(u)$ continuous at $u=s$:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} f(u) \\delta(u - s) \\, du = f(s) \\quad \\text{if } s \\in (a, b)\n$$\nIn our case, the function is $f(u) = u$, and the integration domain is $u \\in [-1, 1]$. The problem specifies that we are in the regime $|s| < 1$, which means $s \\in (-1, 1)$. Therefore, the point $u=s$ lies strictly within the integration limits. Applying the sifting property:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} u \\, \\delta(s - u) \\, du = s\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the imaginary part gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} s\n$$\nThis is the imaginary part of the response function for $|s| < 1$. For $|s| > 1$, the point $u=s$ is outside the integration limits, so the integral would be zero, resulting in $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) = 0$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to explain the physical significance of this result in the context of Landau damping, as described by the dispersion relation for longitudinal collective modes:\n$$\n1 + F_{0} \\, \\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) = 0\n$$\nHere, $F_{0}$ is the real, dimensionless Landau parameter for the $l=0$ channel. Collective modes, such as zero sound, are self-sustaining oscillations of the system, corresponding to the poles of the response function. The given dispersion relation defines the condition for these poles.\nSince $F_{0}$ and the number $1$ are real, for a non-damped mode (where $s$ is real), the dispersion relation can only be satisfied if $\\Phi(s)$ is also real. This means $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s)$ must be zero. Our calculation shows that for $|s|<1$, $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) = -\\frac{\\pi s}{2}$ is non-zero (for $s \\neq 0$). Consequently, no undamped collective modes can exist in the phase velocity regime $|s| \\in (0, 1)$.\n\nThis mathematical result is the signature of Landau damping. The physical origin of this damping is a resonant energy transfer between the collective wave and individual quasiparticles at the Fermi surface. A quasiparticle with momentum $\\mathbf{p}$ has velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{p}}$ with magnitude $v_F$ at the Fermi surface. The component of its velocity along the wave propagation direction ($z$-axis) is $v_z = v_F \\cos\\theta = v_F u$. A resonance occurs when this velocity matches the phase velocity of the wave, $v_{ph} = \\omega/k = s v_F$. The condition for resonance is therefore $v_F u = s v_F$, or simply $s = u$.\n\nThe denominator $s-u$ in the integrand for $\\Phi(s)$ represents this resonance. The imaginary part, which arises from the pole at $u=s$, quantifies the total effect of this resonant absorption over all possible quasiparticle directions $u \\in [-1, 1]$.\nFor $|s| < 1$, the phase velocity of the wave is less than the Fermi velocity. This guarantees that there are always quasiparticles on the Fermi surface with a velocity component $v_z$ that matches the wave's phase velocity. These quasiparticles can \"surf\" the wave, absorbing energy from it and thereby damping its amplitude. This collisionless damping mechanism is Landau damping.\n\nThe sign and magnitude of $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) = -\\frac{\\pi s}{2}$ are crucial:\n- **Magnitude**: The magnitude of the damping is proportional to $|\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s)| = \\frac{\\pi |s|}{2}$. It increases linearly with the dimensionless phase velocity $|s|$. This means that fluctuations are more strongly damped as their phase velocity approaches the Fermi velocity (from below). The non-zero magnitude of $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s)$ in the region $|s| < 1$ prevents the existence of well-defined, long-lived collective modes. This region is known as the particle-hole continuum, where excitations are predominantly single-particle in nature.\n- **Sign**: For a wave propagating with positive frequency ($\\omega > 0$) and wavevector ($k > 0$), we have $s > 0$. In this case, $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s + i 0^{+}) < 0$. This sign is dictated by causality. The power absorbed by a medium is proportional to $-\\omega \\, \\mathrm{Im}\\,\\chi(\\omega)$. The total density response function of the system, $\\chi_{FL}$, is related to $\\Phi$ by $\\chi_{FL} \\propto \\Phi/(1+F_0\\Phi)$. The imaginary part of $\\chi_{FL}$ is proportional to $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi$ (in the regime where the denominator is not near zero). The negative sign of $\\mathrm{Im}\\,\\Phi(s)$ for $s > 0$ ensures that the system absorbs energy from the wave (positive dissipation), causing the wave to decay, which is the definition of damping.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-\\frac{\\pi s}{2}}\n$$", "id": "3024860"}, {"introduction": "Having established that undamped modes must live outside the particle-hole continuum, we now explore how zero sound first emerges from its edge as a weak repulsive interaction is introduced.

This is a linear relationship, $\\omega = c_0 q$, where $c_0$ is the speed of zero sound.\nThe speed of a longitudinal wave in a medium can be expressed as $c = \\sqrt{K/\\rho}$, where $K$ is a longitudinal elastic modulus and $\\rho$ is the mass density. In our case, $\\rho = n m^*$, where $n$ is the particle density and $m^*$ is the quasiparticle effective mass. The speed of zero sound is then given by $c_0^2 = K_0/\\rho$, where $K_0$ is the emergent high-frequency modulus.\nFrom our asymptotic result, we can identify this modulus:\n$$\nc_0^2 = v_F^2 s^2 \\approx v_F^2 \\frac{F_{0}^{s}}{3}\n$$\nThus, the modulus is:\n$$\nK_0 = \\rho c_0^2 \\approx (n m^*) \\left(v_F^2 \\frac{F_{0}^{s}}{3}\\right) = (n m^*) \\left(\\frac{p_F^2}{(m^*)^2} \\frac{F_{0}^{s}}{3}\\right) = \\frac{n p_F^2 F_{0}^{s}}{3m^*}\n$$\nThis modulus $K_0$ represents the rigidity of the Fermi liquid against rapid compressional deformations that occur in the collisionless regime ($\\omega \\tau \\gg 1$). In this regime, the Fermi surface deforms because collisions are not fast enough to restore local equilibrium. The strong repulsive interaction, quantified by the large parameter $F_{0}^{s}$, provides a powerful restoring force against this deformation, leading to a stiff system that supports a high-velocity collective mode.
