Calculation of the Spectral Function $A(k,\\omega)$**\n\nThe retarded Green's function (RGF) is given by:\n$$G^{R}(k,\\omega) = \\left[\\omega-\\epsilon_{k}-\\Sigma^{R}(k,\\omega)\\right]^{-1}$$\nThe retarded self-energy is provided as $\\Sigma^{R}(k,\\omega)=\\beta\\,\\omega - i\\,\\alpha\\,\\omega^{2}$.

Calculation of the Quasiparticle Residue $Z$**\n\nThe quasiparticle residue $Z$ quantifies the overlap between the true interacting ground state and a single-particle state. It is defined in terms of the real part of the self-energy, evaluated at the Fermi energy ($\\omega=0$). The standard formula is:\n$$Z = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{Re}\\,\\Sigma^{R}(k,\\omega)}{\\partial \\omega}\\bigg|_{\\omega=0}\\right)^{-1}$$\nFrom the given self-energy $\\Sigma^{R}(k,\\omega)=\\beta\\,\\omega - i\\,\\alpha\\,\\omega^{2}$, its real part is:\n$$\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\Sigma^{R}(k,\\omega) = \\beta\\,\\omega$$\nWe compute the partial derivative with respect to $\\omega$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{Re}\\,\\Sigma^{R}(k,\\omega)}{\\partial \\omega} = \\beta$$\nThis derivative is a constant, so its value at $\\omega=0$ is simply $\\beta$.

Determination of the Scattering Rate $\\Gamma(\\omega)$**\n\nThe scattering rate $\\Gamma(\\omega)$ is related to the lifetime of the quasiparticle and is defined in the problem as the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) of the quasiparticle peak in the spectral function. To identify this quantity, it is instructive to rewrite the RGF in a form that explicitly shows the quasiparticle properties. Starting from our expression for $G^{R}(k,\\omega)^{-1}$:\n$$G^{R}(k,\\omega)^{-1} = (1-\\beta)\\omega - \\epsilon_{k} + i\\,\\alpha\\,\\omega^{2}$$\nWe can factor out the term $(1-\\beta) = 1/Z$:\n$$G^{R}(k,\\omega)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{Z} \\left(\\omega - Z\\epsilon_{k} + i\\,Z\\alpha\\,\\omega^{2}\\right)$$\nTherefore, the RGF is:\n$$G^{R}(k,\\omega) = \\frac{Z}{\\omega - E_{k}^{*} + i\\,Z\\alpha\\,\\omega^{2}}$$\nwhere we have defined the renormalized quasiparticle energy $E_{k}^{*} = Z\\epsilon_{k} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{k}}{1-\\beta}$.\n\nThe expression for $G^{R}(k,\\omega)$ closely resembles the canonical form for a quasiparticle propagator, $G^{R}_{QP}(k,\\omega) \\approx \\frac{Z}{\\omega - E_k^* + i\\Gamma_k}$, where $\\Gamma_k$ is the decay rate (or HWHM of the spectral peak). In our case, the width term is energy-dependent. Comparing the two forms, we can identify the energy-dependent scattering rate $\\Gamma(\\omega)$ as the term playing the role of the width in the denominator:\n$$\\Gamma(\\omega) = Z\\alpha\\,\\omega^{2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $Z$:\n$$\\Gamma(\\omega) = \\frac{\\alpha\\,\\omega^{2}}{1-\\beta}$$\nThis expression is consistent with the HWHM definition in the well-defined quasiparticle limit (where the peak is sharp). In this limit, the spectral function $A(k,\\omega) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\mathrm{Im}\\,G^{R}(k,\\omega)$ becomes a Lorentzian centered at $\\omega \\approx E_{k}^{*}$, and its HWHM is precisely given by the imaginary term in the denominator evaluated at the peak, i.e., $\\Gamma(E_k^*) = Z\\alpha(E_k^*)^2$.

The formula involves a correlation function of current operators, which, in a diagrammatic expansion, includes vertex corrections that dress the bare current vertex $e\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{k}}$. For elastic scattering by static impurities in the ladder approximation, the dressed vertex $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}(\\boldsymbol{k})$ for a quasiparticle with momentum $\\boldsymbol{k}$ on the Fermi surface satisfies the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}_{0}(\\boldsymbol{k}) + n_{i} \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{k}'} |V(\\boldsymbol{k} - \\boldsymbol{k}')|^{2} G^{R}(\\boldsymbol{k}', E_{F}) G^{A}(\\boldsymbol{k}', E_{F}) \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}(\\boldsymbol{k}')\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}_{0}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = e\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{k}} = e\\frac{\\hbar\\boldsymbol{k}}{m}$, $n_{i}$ is the concentration of impurities, $V(\\boldsymbol{q})$ is the scattering potential with momentum transfer $\\boldsymbol{q}=\\boldsymbol{k}-\\boldsymbol{k}'$, and $G^{R/A}$ are the retarded/advanced Green's functions evaluated at the Fermi energy, $E_{F}$. The sum over $\\boldsymbol{k}'$ is restricted to the Fermi surface.\n\nThe product of Green's functions, after integrating over energy, is related to the quasiparticle lifetime $\\tau$. The BS equation can be written as an integral equation over the Fermi surface:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}(\\boldsymbol{k}) = e\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{k}} + \\mathcal{C} \\int_{FS} \\frac{d\\Omega_{\\boldsymbol{k}'}}{4\\pi} |V(\\boldsymbol{k} - \\boldsymbol{k}')|^{2} \\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}(\\boldsymbol{k}')\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{C}$ is a constant containing the density of states and other factors.\n\nThe problem specifies isotropic, point-like impurity scattering. This implies that the scattering matrix element is independent of the momentum transfer $\\boldsymbol{q}$. Thus, $|V(\\boldsymbol{k} - \\boldsymbol{k}')|^{2} = |V_{0}|^{2}$, a constant.

For elastic scattering on the Fermi sphere of radius $k_F$, we have $q^{2} = 2k_{F}^{2}(1-\\cos\\theta)$.

The denominator becomes $2k_{F}^{2}(1-u+\\delta)$.\nDropping the common factor $(2k_F^2)^{-2}$ which will cancel in the ratio, the relevant integrals become:\n$$\nJ = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{du}{(1-u+\\delta)^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\frac{(1-u)du}{(1-u+\\delta)^{2}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we evaluate $J$:\nLet $w = 1-u+\\delta$, so $du = -dw$.
