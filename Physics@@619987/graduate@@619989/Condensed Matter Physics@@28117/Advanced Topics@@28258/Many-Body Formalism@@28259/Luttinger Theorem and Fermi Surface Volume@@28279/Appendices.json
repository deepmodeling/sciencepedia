This sphere, known as the Fermi sphere, contains all the occupied orbital states at $T=0$.\n\nWe can calculate the total number of occupied orbital states, $N_{orb}$, by determining how many allowed $\\mathbf{k}$-vectors fit inside the Fermi sphere. In the thermodynamic limit (large $L$), the discrete points are dense enough that we can find this number by dividing the volume of the Fermi sphere by the volume per state, $V_{\\mathbf{k}}$.

The crystal has a real-space area of $A_{\\mathrm{crystal}} = N a^2$, where $a$ is the lattice constant.

Therefore, a completely filled band accommodates $2N$ electrons.\n\nThe electron filling $n$ is defined as the total number of electrons per unit cell. For a crystal with $N$ unit cells, the total number of electrons is $N_e = n N$.\n\nThe problem specifies a system with no broken symmetries, implying no spin polarization.

Luttinger's theorem states that for a Fermi liquid, the k-space volume enclosed by the Fermi surface is determined by the particle density, independent of interactions.
