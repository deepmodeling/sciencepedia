No numerical evaluation is required and no units need to be reported.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the mean free path $\\ell(\\mathbf{k})$ of a quasiparticle in a crystalline solid. The derivation must be based on the provided definitions, the semiclassical model of electron dynamics, and the characterization of scattering as a stationary Poisson process.\n\nThe provided information establishes the following:\n- The state of a quasiparticle is defined by its wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$.\n- The quasiparticle's group velocity is $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k})$, and its speed is the magnitude of this velocity, $v_{\\mathbf{k}} = |\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}|$.\n- A critical assumption is that the group velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is constant for the duration of a single free flight between two consecutive scattering events. This is a consequence of the external force $\\mathbf{F}$ being sufficiently weak.\n- Scattering events are due to dilute, static disorder, which makes them uncorrelated. The process is stationary, meaning its statistical properties do not change over time. This justifies modeling the scattering as a stationary Poisson process.\n- The rate of scattering for a quasiparticle in state $\\mathbf{k}$ is given as $1/\\tau(\\mathbf{k})$, where $\\tau(\\mathbf{k})$ is the quasiparticle lifetime.\n\nLet $T$ be the random variable for the time elapsed between two consecutive scattering events. For a stationary Poisson process, the probability of an event occurring in an infinitesimal time interval $dt$ is $\\lambda dt$, where $\\lambda$ is the constant rate of events. In this problem, the scattering rate is $\\lambda = 1/\\tau(\\mathbf{k})$.\nThe probability of a quasiparticle surviving without scattering for a duration $t$ is the survival function $S(t)$. For a Poisson process, this is given by $S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. Therefore, the probability that a quasiparticle has not scattered by time $t$ is:\n$$ P(T > t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right) $$\nThe probability density function (PDF), $p(t)$, for the free-flight time $T$ is obtained from the negative derivative of the survival function:\n$$ p(t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} P(T > t) = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right) $$\nThis function is valid for $t \\ge 0$. It is the exponential probability distribution.\n\nThe problem states that $\\tau(\\mathbf{k})$ is the quasiparticle lifetime. For consistency, this should correspond to the mean time between scattering events. We verify this by calculating the expectation value of the free-flight time $T$:\n$$ \\langle t \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\, p(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t \\frac{1}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right) dt $$\nWe solve this integral using integration by parts, with $u = t$ and $dv = \\frac{1}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right) dt$. This gives $du = dt$ and $v = -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right)$.\n$$ \\langle t \\rangle = \\left[ -t \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right)\\right) dt $$\nThe boundary term $\\left[-t \\exp(-t/\\tau(\\mathbf{k}))\\right]$ evaluates to $0$ at both the lower limit ($t=0$) and the upper limit ($t \\to \\infty$), as the exponential decay dominates the linear term. The expression thus simplifies to:\n$$ \\langle t \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right) dt = \\left[ -\\tau(\\mathbf{k}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau(\\mathbf{k})}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} $$\n$$ \\langle t \\rangle = (0) - \\left(-\\tau(\\mathbf{k}) \\exp(0)\\right) = \\tau(\\mathbf{k}) $$\nThis confirms that the parameter $\\tau(\\mathbf{k})$ is precisely the mean free time between scattering events.\n\nThe mean free path, $\\ell(\\mathbf{k})$, is defined as the ensemble average of the distance a quasiparticle travels between scattering events. As per the problem statement, the velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is constant during this interval. The distance $d$ traveled in a time $t$ is therefore simply the product of the constant speed $v_{\\mathbf{k}}$ and the time $t$:\n$$ d(t) = v_{\\mathbf{k}} t $$\nTo find the mean free path $\\ell(\\mathbf{k})$, we must compute the expectation value of this distance $d(t)$. The average is taken over the distribution of free-flight times $t$, described by the PDF $p(t)$.\n$$ \\ell(\\mathbf{k}) = \\langle d(t) \\rangle = \\langle v_{\\mathbf{k}} t \\rangle $$\nSince the speed $v_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is a constant for a given initial state $\\mathbf{k}$ and does not vary during the flight, it can be factored out of the expectation value operator:\n$$ \\ell(\\mathbf{k}) = v_{\\mathbf{k}} \\langle t \\rangle $$\nSubstituting the previously derived result for the mean free time, $\\langle t \\rangle = \\tau(\\mathbf{k})$, we arrive at the final expression for the mean free path:\n$$ \\ell(\\mathbf{k}) = v_{\\mathbf{k}} \\tau(\\mathbf{k}) $$\nThis fundamental result demonstrates that the mean free path is the product of the quasiparticle's speed and its lifetime, a direct consequence of the semiclassical dynamics and the statistical nature of scattering.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{v_{\\mathbf{k}}\\tau(\\mathbf{k})} $$", "id": "3013062"}, {"introduction": "While the semiclassical picture is intuitive, a deeper understanding requires the language of quantum many-body theory.

In the quasiparticle picture, an excitation of the interacting system is described as a particle-like entity with a definite momentum $\\hbar k$ and energy $E_k$. In the absence of scattering processes that would limit its existence, a quasiparticle would have an infinite lifetime, and its spectral function $A(k,\\omega)$ would be an infinitely sharp delta function, $A(k,\\omega) \\propto \\delta(\\omega - E_k)$. However, in a real many-body system, interactions cause quasiparticles to scatter off one another, or off impurities or phonons. These scattering events limit the quasiparticle's lifetime, let us call it $\\tau$.\n\nAccording to the time-energy uncertainty principle, a state with a finite lifetime $\\tau$ cannot have a perfectly defined energy. Its energy is \"smeared out\" over a range $\\Delta E$, where $\\Delta E \\cdot \\tau \\approx \\hbar$. The Lorentzian shape of the spectral function $A(k,\\omega)$ that we derived is the characteristic lineshape for an exponentially decaying state. The width of this distribution, $\\Gamma$, is precisely this energy uncertainty $\\Delta E$. Therefore, $\\Gamma$ is directly related to the quasiparticle lifetime $\\tau$ by $\\Gamma = \\hbar/\\tau$. The quantity $\\Gamma/\\hbar = 1/\\tau$ is the total scattering rate of the quasiparticle, representing the probability per unit time that the quasiparticle will be scattered out of the state with momentum $\\hbar k$. A larger value of $\\Gamma$ signifies stronger scattering, a shorter lifetime, and a broader, less well-defined quasiparticle peak.
