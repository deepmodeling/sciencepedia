The total internal energy per unit volume, $u(T)$, of a system of fermions is given by the integral of the energy per state multiplied by the density of states (DOS) and the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, $f(\\epsilon)$. In Landau Fermi liquid theory, the low-energy excitations are quasiparticles, which obey Fermi statistics. Thus, we use the quasiparticle DOS per unit volume, $N^{*}(\\epsilon^{*})$, and quasiparticle energy, $\\epsilon^{*}$:\n$$u(T) = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^{*} N^{*}(\\epsilon^{*}) f(\\epsilon^{*}) d\\epsilon^{*}$$\nwhere $f(\\epsilon^{*}) = (\\exp((\\epsilon^{*} - \\mu)/(k_B T)) + 1)^{-1}$, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. At low temperatures ($T \\to 0$), $\\mu \\approx E_F$, the Fermi energy.\n\nThe heat capacity at constant volume per unit volume is $c_V = (\\partial u / \\partial T)_V$.\n$$c_V = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^{*} N^{*}(\\epsilon^{*}) f(\\epsilon^{*}) d\\epsilon^{*} = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^{*} N^{*}(\\epsilon^{*}) \\frac{\\partial f(\\epsilon^{*})}{\\partial T} d\\epsilon^{*}$$\nTo evaluate this integral at low temperatures ($k_B T \\ll E_F$), we employ the Sommerfeld expansion. A standard result derived from this expansion for the internal energy is:\n$$u(T) \\approx u(0) + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} (k_B T)^2 N^{*}(0)$$\nwhere $N^{*}(0)$ is the quasiparticle DOS per unit volume at the Fermi level. The heat capacity is then found by differentiation with respect to temperature $T$:\n$$c_V(T) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial T} \\approx \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} k_B^2 N^{*}(0) T$$\nThe specific heat coefficient per unit volume, $\\gamma$, is defined as $\\gamma = c_V/T$. Therefore,\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} k_B^2 N^{*}(0)$$\n\nSecond, we express $N^{*}(0)$ in terms of the quasiparticle effective mass $m^{*}$, the Fermi wavevector $k_F$, and the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$. The DOS per unit volume for a three-dimensional isotropic system is given by:\n$$N(\\epsilon) = g_s \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3} \\delta(\\epsilon - \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}})$$\nwhere $g_s=2$ for spin-$1/2$ electrons. Using spherical coordinates in k-space, $d^3k = 4\\pi k^2 dk$.

Substituting this gives:\n$$N^{*}(0) = \\frac{k_F^2}{\\pi^2 \\hbar v_F^{*}}$$\nIn Fermi liquid theory, the relationship between the effective mass $m^{*}$ and the Fermi velocity is analogous to the free electron case: $v_F^{*} = \\hbar k_F / m^{*}$.

The quasiparticle energy $\\epsilon^*_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is defined implicitly as the solution to the equation $\\epsilon^*_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\text{Re}\\Sigma(\\mathbf{k}, \\epsilon^*_{\\mathbf{k}}) = 0$, where $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the bare dispersion and $\\Sigma(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ is the electron self-energy.

The problem states that the self-energy $\\Sigma$ is momentum-independent near the Fermi level. This implies that $\\partial \\text{Re}\\Sigma / \\partial \\mathbf{k} = 0$, and $Z$ is also momentum-independent. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\epsilon^*_{\\mathbf{k}} \\cdot Z^{-1} = \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$$\nMultiplying by $\\hbar$ gives the relationship between the quasiparticle velocity $\\mathbf{v}^*_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\epsilon^*_{\\mathbf{k}}$ and the bare-band velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$:\n$$\\mathbf{v}^*_{\\mathbf{k}} = Z \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{k}}$$\nAt the Fermi surface, $v_F^{*} = Z v_F$.

The expression for $N_0(0)$ is identical to that for $N^{*}(0)$ but with the bare mass $m$ instead of $m^{*}$:\n$$N_0(0) = \\frac{m k_F}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}$$\nThe Luttinger theorem, stated in the problem, guarantees that $k_F$ is fixed by the electron density and is not altered by interactions, so the same $k_F$ is used for both $N_0(0)$ and $N^*(0)$. We can re-express the term $m k_F / \\hbar^2$ as $\\pi^2 N_0(0)$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{k_B^2}{3} \\left( \\frac{m k_F}{\\hbar^2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\frac{k_B^2}{3} (\\pi^2 N_0(0))$$\nThis yields the final result:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2 N_0(0)}{3 Z}$$\nThis celebrated result shows that the specific heat is enhanced by a factor of $1/Z = m^{*}/m$ compared to the non-interacting system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2 N_0(0)}{3 Z}}$$", "id": "2985522"}, {"introduction": "Interactions not only renormalize single-particle properties but can also give rise to entirely new collective excitations involving the coherent motion of the entire electron system.

Typically, for small $q$, the plasma frequency $\\omega_p$ is significantly higher than the upper boundary of the continuum, $\\omega_{_+}(q) \\approx v_F q$. As $q$ increases, $\\omega_{_+}(q)$ increases quadratically. Landau damping sets in at the smallest wave number, $q_{\\mathrm{onset}}$, where the plasmon dispersion enters the continuum. This occurs when the plasmon energy matches the energy of the upper boundary of the continuum:\n$$\n\\omega_p = \\omega_{_+}(q_{\\mathrm{onset}})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega_{_+}(q)$:\n$$\n\\omega_p = \\frac{\\hbar q_{\\mathrm{onset}}^2}{2m} + v_F q_{\\mathrm{onset}}\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $q_{\\mathrm{onset}}$. Rearranging it into standard form $ax^2+bx+c=0$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2m}\\right)q_{\\mathrm{onset}}^2 + (v_F)q_{\\mathrm{onset}} - \\omega_p = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $q_{\\mathrm{onset}}$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{onset}} = \\frac{-v_F \\pm \\sqrt{v_F^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2m}\\right)(-\\omega_p)}}{2\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2m}\\right)} = \\frac{-v_F \\pm \\sqrt{v_F^2 + \\frac{2\\hbar\\omega_p}{m}}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{m}}\n$$\nSince the wave number $q_{\\mathrm{onset}}$ must be a positive quantity, we select the positive root:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{onset}} = \\frac{-v_F + \\sqrt{v_F^2 + \\frac{2\\hbar\\omega_p}{m}}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{m}}\n$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{onset}} = \\frac{m}{\\hbar} \\left( \\sqrt{v_F^2 + \\frac{2\\hbar\\omega_p}{m}} - v_F \\right)\n$$\nThis expression gives the onset wave number for Landau damping in terms of the specified parameters $m$, $v_F$, $\\omega_p$, and $\\hbar$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{m}{\\hbar} \\left( \\sqrt{v_{F}^{2} + \\frac{2\\hbar\\omega_{p}}{m}} - v_{F} \\right)}$$", "id": "2985497"}]}
