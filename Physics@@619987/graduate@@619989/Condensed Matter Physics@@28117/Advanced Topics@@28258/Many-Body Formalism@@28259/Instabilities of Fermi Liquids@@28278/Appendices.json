In the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), the interacting (or screened) susceptibility $\\chi(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)$ is related to the non-interacting (or bare) susceptibility $\\chi_0(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)$ through a Dyson-like equation. For the density (charge) channel, this equation sums all particle-hole bubble diagrams and is given by:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega) = \\frac{\\chi_0(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)}{1 - V(\\mathbf{q}) \\chi_0(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)}\n$$\nwhere $V(\\mathbf{q})$ is the Fourier transform of the two-body interaction potential.\n\nThe problem specifies a momentum-independent contact interaction, which in real space is $V(\\mathbf{r}) = g \\delta(\\mathbf{r})$. The Fourier transform of this interaction is a constant, independent of the momentum transfer $\\mathbf{q}$:\n$$\nV(\\mathbf{q}) = \\int d^3r \\, V(\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(-i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}) = \\int d^3r \\, g \\delta(\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(-i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}) = g\n$$\nSubstituting this into the RPA formula gives:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega) = \\frac{\\chi_0(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)}{1 - g \\chi_0(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)}\n$$\nWe are interested in the static ($\\omega=0$) and long-wavelength ($\\mathbf{q}\\to 0$) limit. The problem provides the value for the non-interacting susceptibility in this limit:\n$$\n\\chi_0(\\mathbf{q}\\to 0, \\omega=0) = -N(0)\n$$\nwhere $N(0)$ is the total density of states per unit volume at the Fermi level, including spin degeneracy. This is a standard result for a non-interacting Fermi gas at temperature $T=0$. The negative sign arises from the definition of susceptibility as the density response to an external potential, $\\delta n = \\chi \\phi_{ext}$. An increase in potential $\\phi_{ext} > 0$ raises the energy levels, thus lowering the density at a fixed chemical potential.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\chi_0$ into the RPA formula for $\\chi$, we obtain the interacting static, long-wavelength susceptibility:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbf{q}\\to 0, \\omega=0) = \\frac{-N(0)}{1 - g(-N(0))} = \\frac{-N(0)}{1 + g N(0)}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Connection to Landau Fermi Liquid Theory and finding $F_0^s$**\n\nNext, we relate this result to the framework of Landau Fermi liquid theory. The thermodynamic compressibility of a system, $\\kappa$, is defined as $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu}$, where $n$ is the particle density and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The derivative $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu}$ represents the change in density in response to a uniform shift in the chemical potential. This is physically equivalent to the response to an external potential $\\phi_{ext} = -\\delta\\mu$. The density susceptibility $\\chi$ is defined by $\\delta n = \\chi \\phi_{ext}$. Therefore, we can establish the connection:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{\\delta n}{\\delta \\mu} = \\frac{\\chi \\phi_{ext}}{-\\phi_{ext}} = -\\chi\n$$\nUsing our result for the static, long-wavelength interacting susceptibility, we find the thermodynamic derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} = -\\chi(\\mathbf{q}\\to 0, \\omega=0) = - \\left( \\frac{-N(0)}{1 + g N(0)} \\right) = \\frac{N(0)}{1 + g N(0)}\n$$\nIn Landau Fermi liquid theory, the compressibility is related to the Landau parameters. Specifically, the change in density with respect to the chemical potential is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{N^*(0)}{1+F_0^s}\n$$\nwhere $F_0^s$ is the dimensionless Landau parameter in the spin-symmetric $l=0$ channel, and $N^*(0)$ is the quasiparticle density of states at the Fermi energy. In the simplified model with a contact interaction, the interaction does not renormalize the quasiparticle dispersion or mass, so we can set the quasiparticle effective mass equal to the bare mass, $m^*=m$. This implies the quasiparticle density of states is the same as the bare density of states, $N^*(0) = N(0)$. Thus, the LFL expression becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{N(0)}{1+F_0^s}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions derived for $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\mu}$:\n$$\n\\frac{N(0)}{1 + g N(0)} = \\frac{N(0)}{1+F_0^s}\n$$\nSince $N(0) \\neq 0$, we can cancel it from the numerators and equate the denominators:\n$$\n1 + g N(0) = 1 + F_0^s\n$$\nThis directly yields the expression for the Landau parameter $F_0^s$ in terms of the interaction strength $g$ and the density of states $N(0)$:\n$$\nF_0^s = g N(0)\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Stability Condition and Critical Interaction $g_c$**\n\nA homogeneous state becomes unstable when the response to a small perturbation diverges, indicating the system's willingness to undergo a spontaneous change. For density fluctuations, the relevant response function is the static, long-wavelength density susceptibility $\\chi(\\mathbf{q}\\to 0, \\omega=0)$. A divergence in this susceptibility signals an instability towards phase separation or the formation of macroscopic density inhomogeneities.\n\nOur expression for the interacting susceptibility is:\n$$\n\\chi(\\mathbf{q}\\to 0, \\omega=0) = \\frac{-N(0)}{1 + g N(0)}\n$$\nThis function diverges when its denominator approaches zero:\n$$\n1 + g N(0) \\to 0\n$$\nThe critical value of the coupling, $g_c$, is the value of $g$ for which this condition is met:\n$$\n1 + g_c N(0) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $g_c$, we find:\n$$\ng_c = -\\frac{1}{N(0)}\n$$\nThis corresponds to an attractive interaction ($g<0$). In the language of Landau theory, using $F_0^s = g N(0)$, the instability occurs at $F_0^s = -1$. This is the well-known Pomeranchuk instability condition for the compressibility of a Fermi liquid. For $F_0^s < -1$ (or $g < g_c$), the compressibility becomes negative, and the uniform liquid is thermodynamically unstable.\n\nThe final results are the expression for $F_0^s$ and the value of $g_c$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ng N(0) & -\\frac{1}{N(0)}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2995931"}, {"introduction": "An instability signals the breakdown of a phase and the birth of a new one with lower energy.

We start with the continuity equation for spin density, $s(\\mathbf{r}, t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j}_s = 0 $$\nThe spin current $\\mathbf{j}_s$ is driven by the gradient of the local spin chemical potential, $\\mu_s$, according to Fick's law: $\\mathbf{j}_s = -\\sigma_s \\nabla \\mu_s$, where $\\sigma_s$ is the spin conductivity. Using the Einstein relation $\\sigma_s = D \\nu$ (where $D$ is the diffusion constant and $\\nu$ is the single-spin DOS), this becomes $\\mathbf{j}_s = -D\\nu \\nabla \\mu_s$.\nThe local spin chemical potential is composed of a term from the spin accumulation itself and the external Zeeman field: $\\mu_s = s/\\nu - h$. The term $s/\\nu$ is the internal potential opposing further spin buildup (since the energy density of an accumulation is $\\frac{s^2}{2\\nu}$), and $-h$ is the external driving potential.\nCombining these, we get the current:\n$$ \\mathbf{j}_s = -D\\nu \\nabla \\left( \\frac{s}{\\nu} - h \\right) = -D \\nabla s + D\\nu \\nabla h $$\nSubstituting this into the continuity equation gives the diffusion equation with a source term:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot (-D \\nabla s + D\\nu \\nabla h) = D \\nabla^2 s - D\\nu \\nabla^2 h $$\nWe now Fourier transform this equation in space and time, using the convention $f(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega) \\propto \\int d^d\\mathbf{r} dt \\, e^{-i(\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)} f(\\mathbf{r}, t)$.

The interacting susceptibility $\\chi_s$ is related to the non-interacting one $\\chi_{s,0}$ via the Dyson-like equation:\n$$ \\chi_s(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega) = \\frac{\\chi_{s,0}(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)}{1 - V_{\\text{eff}} \\chi_{s,0}(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)} $$\nHere $V_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective interaction vertex in the spin channel. For a repulsive contact interaction $U>0$, a local accumulation of parallel spins is energetically favored over anti-parallel spins. This corresponds to an effective interaction vertex $V_{\\text{eff}} = U$ that enhances spin fluctuations. Thus, the RPA formula is:\n$$ \\chi_s(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega) = \\frac{\\chi_{s,0}(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)}{1 - U \\chi_{s,0}(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)} $$\nThe problem provides the relation for the Landau parameter $F_0^a$ in the spin-antisymmetric channel: $F_0^a = -\\nu U$. This is a standard definition relating the microscopic interaction $U$ to the phenomenological Fermi liquid parameter. From this, we have $U = -F_0^a / \\nu$.

An instability corresponds to a pole moving from the lower half-plane ($\\text{Im}(\\omega) < 0$) to the upper half-plane ($\\text{Im}(\\omega) > 0$), signifying an exponentially growing mode. The pole of $\\chi_s(\\mathbf{q}, \\omega)$ is located at:\n$$ \\omega = -iDq^2(1 + F_0^a) $$\nFor the system to be stable, the pole must have a negative imaginary part, which requires $1 + F_0^a > 0$, or $F_0^a > -1$. The onset of an instability occurs when the pole reaches the real axis, which happens when $1+F_0^a = 0$. In words, the Stoner criterion for the onset of ferromagnetic instability is met when the Landau parameter $F_0^a$ reaches the critical value of $-1$. At this point, the static, long-wavelength susceptibility $\\chi_s(\\mathbf{q}\\to 0, \\omega=0) = \\nu/(1+F_0^a)$ diverges, indicating a spontaneous transition to a ferromagnetic state. This highlights that a repulsive interaction ($U>0$), which corresponds to a negative Landau parameter $F_0^a = -\\nu U$, drives the system towards ferromagnetism. The interaction renormalizes the diffusion constant to an effective value $D_s = D(1+F_0^a)$, which vanishes at the instability, indicating the freezing of spin fluctuations into a static magnetic order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\nu D q^2}{-i\\omega + D q^2 (1 + F_{0}^{a})}}$$", "id": "2995941"}]}
