The standard expression for the Josephson current in this formalism is:\n$$ I(\\phi) = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T \\sigma_N A}{e \\hbar} \\sum_{\\omega_n} \\text{Im} \\left[ F^*(x, \\omega_n) \\frac{dF(x, \\omega_n)}{dx} \\right] $$\nwhere $\\sigma_N$ is the normal-state conductivity and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. The expression on the right must be independent of $x$ due to current conservation. To evaluate this term, we separate $F$ into real and imaginary parts.\n$$ F_R = F_{S0} \\frac{\\cos(\\phi/2) \\cosh(k_n x)}{\\cosh(k_n L/2)}, \\quad F_I = F_{S0} \\frac{\\sin(\\phi/2) \\sinh(k_n x)}{\\sinh(k_n L/2)} $$\nThe derivatives are:\n$$ F'_R = F_{S0} k_n \\frac{\\cos(\\phi/2) \\sinh(k_n x)}{\\cosh(k_n L/2)}, \\quad F'_I = F_{S0} k_n \\frac{\\sin(\\phi/2) \\cosh(k_n x)}{\\sinh(k_n L/2)} $$\nThe required imaginary part is $\\text{Im}[F^* \\frac{dF}{dx}] = F_R F'_I - F_I F'_R$:\n$$ F_R F'_I - F_I F'_R = F_{S0}^2 k_n \\frac{\\cos(\\phi/2)\\sin(\\phi/2)}{\\cosh(k_n L/2)\\sinh(k_n L/2)} \\left( \\cosh^2(k_n x) - \\sinh^2(k_n x) \\right) $$\nUsing $\\cosh^2(z) - \\sinh^2(z) = 1$, $\\sin\\phi=2\\sin(\\phi/2)\\cos(\\phi/2)$, and $\\sinh(2z)=2\\sinh(z)\\cosh(z)$:\n$$ \\text{Im}\\left[F^* \\frac{dF}{dx}\\right] = F_{S0}^2 k_n \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\phi}{\\frac{1}{2}\\sinh(k_n L)} = \\frac{k_n F_{S0}^2 \\sin\\phi}{\\sinh(k_n L)} $$\nThe sum over Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n=(2n+1)\\pi k_B T$ can be restricted to positive frequencies by multiplying by $2$, as the summand is an even function of $\\omega_n$.\nUsing the normal state resistance $R_N = L/(\\sigma_N A)$, the current-phase relation is:\n$$ I(\\phi) = \\frac{4\\pi k_B T L}{e \\hbar R_N} \\sin\\phi \\sum_{\\omega_n > 0} \\frac{k_n F_{S0}^2}{\\sinh(k_n L)} $$\nSubstituting $k_n = \\sqrt{2\\omega_n/(\\hbar D)}$ and $F_{S0}^2 = \\Delta^2(T)/(\\omega_n^2 + \\Delta^2(T))$:\n$$ I(\\phi) = \\frac{4\\pi k_B T}{e \\hbar R_N} \\sin\\phi \\sum_{\\omega_n > 0} \\frac{\\Delta^2}{\\omega_n^2+\\Delta^2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\omega_n L^2/(\\hbar D)}}{\\sinh(\\sqrt{2\\omega_n L^2/(\\hbar D)})} $$\nThe canonical result, which is consistent with this derivation up to definitions, is:\n$$ I(\\phi) = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{e R_N} \\sin\\phi \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\Delta^2(T)}{\\omega_n^2+\\Delta^2(T)} \\frac{\\alpha_n}{\\sinh(\\alpha_n)} $$\nwhere $\\alpha_n = k_n L = L\\sqrt{2\\omega_n/(\\hbar D)} = \\sqrt{2\\omega_n/E_{\\text{Th}}}$, with the Thouless energy $E_{\\text{Th}} = \\hbar D/L^2$. The critical current $I_c(T)$ is the maximum of $I(\\phi)$, which is the coefficient of $\\sin\\phi$.\n\nThus, the final expression for the critical current is:\n$$ I_c(T) = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{e R_N} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\Delta^2(T)}{\\omega_n^2 + \\Delta^2(T)} \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\omega_n/E_{\\text{Th}}}}{\\sinh(\\sqrt{2\\omega_n/E_{\\text{Th}}})} $$\nwith $\\omega_n=(2n+1)\\pi k_B T$.\n\nAnalysis of Limiting Cases:\n1.  **Short-junction regime**: This corresponds to $L \\to 0$, so $E_{\\text{Th}} \\to \\infty$. The argument of the sinh function $\\alpha_n = \\sqrt{2\\omega_n/E_{\\text{Th}}} \\to 0$. We use the approximation $\\sinh(z) \\approx z$ for small $z$. The fraction $\\alpha_n/\\sinh(\\alpha_n) \\to 1$.\n    $$ I_c(T) \\approx \\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{e R_N} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\Delta^2(T)}{\\omega_n^2 + \\Delta^2(T)} $$\n    This sum evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi \\Delta(T)}{2e R_N} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\Delta(T)}{2k_B T}\\right)$. This is the well-known Kulik-Omelyanchuk result for a short diffusive junction.\n\n2.  **Long-junction regime**: This corresponds to $L \\to \\infty$, so $E_{\\text{Th}} \\to 0$. The argument $\\alpha_n \\to \\infty$. We use $\\sinh(z) \\approx e^z/2$ for large $z$.\n    $$ I_c(T) \\approx \\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{e R_N} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\Delta^2(T)}{\\omega_n^2+\\Delta^2(T)} (2\\alpha_n e^{-\\alpha_n}) $$\n    The terms in the sum are exponentially suppressed. The dominant contribution comes from the lowest Matsubara frequency, $\\omega_0 = \\pi k_B T$.\n    $$ I_c(T) \\propto \\frac{k_B T}{e R_N} \\frac{\\Delta^2(T)}{(\\pi k_B T)^2+\\Delta^2(T)} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{E_{\\text{Th}}}} \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{E_{\\text{Th}}}}\\right) $$\n    The critical current decays exponentially with $L/\\sqrt{D}$, which is characteristic of the long junction limit.\n\n**Crossover**: The crossover between the short- and long-junction regimes occurs when the argument of the sinh function, $\\alpha_n$, is of order unity for the frequencies that dominate the sum. At finite temperatures, the dominant frequency contributing to the sum is typically the lowest one, $\\omega_0 = \\pi k_B T$. The crossover condition is thus $\\alpha_0 = \\sqrt{2\\pi k_B T / E_{\\text{Th}}} \\sim 1$, or $E_{\\text{Th}} \\sim \\pi k_B T$. At very low temperatures, the sum is dominated by frequencies $\\omega_n \\sim \\Delta(T)$. The crossover condition becomes $\\sqrt{2\\Delta(T)/E_{\\text{Th}}} \\sim 1$, or $E_{\\text{Th}} \\sim \\Delta(T)$. Therefore, the crossover is generally set by the competition between the Thouless energy $E_{\\text{Th}}$ and the characteristic energy scales of the superconductors, namely $\\max(k_B T, \\Delta(T))$. The junction is \"short\" if $E_{\\text{Th}} \\gg \\max(k_B T, \\Delta(T))$ and \"long\" if $E_{\\text{Th}} \\ll \\max(k_B T, \\Delta(T))$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{I_c(T) = \\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{e R_N} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\Delta^2(T)}{((2n+1)\\pi k_B T)^2 + \\Delta^2(T)} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2(2n+1)\\pi k_B T}{E_{\\text{Th}}}}}{\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2(2n+1)\\pi k_B T}{E_{\\text{Th}}}}\\right)}}$$", "id": "3010913"}]}
