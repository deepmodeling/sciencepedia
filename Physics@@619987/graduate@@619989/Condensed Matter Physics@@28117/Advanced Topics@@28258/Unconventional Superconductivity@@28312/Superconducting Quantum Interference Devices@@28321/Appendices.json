Each junction is modeled by the Resistively and Capacitively Shunted Junction (RCSJ) model, with identical critical current $I_{c}$ and shunt resistance $R$. The junction capacitances are negligible in the overdamped limit, so the Stewart–McCumber parameter is small and capacitive terms can be ignored. The loop inductance is also negligible, so the self-induced flux is negligible compared to the applied magnetic flux. A constant bias current $I_{b}$ is injected into the SQUID.

I will now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a symmetric DC SQUID with two identical Josephson junctions in a parallel configuration. The total bias current $I_b$ splits to flow through the two junctions. Based on Kirchhoff's current law, a foundational principle for electrical circuits, the sum of the currents through the two junctions, $I_1(t)$ and $I_2(t)$, must equal the total bias current $I_b$:\n$$I_b = I_1(t) + I_2(t)$$\nThe problem provides the constitutive relation for the current through each junction ($j=1,2$) in the overdamped RCSJ model:\n$$I_j(t) = I_c \\sin \\phi_j(t) + \\frac{V(t)}{R}$$\nwhere $I_c$ is the critical current, $R$ is the shunt resistance, $V(t)$ is the voltage across the junction, and $\\phi_j(t)$ is the gauge-invariant phase difference across the junction.

In the high-bias regime ($I_b > 2I_c$), the junction is always in the \"running state,\" where the phase $\\phi(t)$ continuously increases with time, and the voltage $V(t)$ is a periodic function. The period of this oscillation, $T$, is the time required for the phase $\\phi(t)$ to advance by $2\\pi$.
