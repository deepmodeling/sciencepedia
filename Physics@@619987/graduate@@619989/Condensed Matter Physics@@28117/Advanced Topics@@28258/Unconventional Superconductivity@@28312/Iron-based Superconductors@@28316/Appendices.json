Do not include any physical units in your final answer.", "solution": "The problem requires the determination of several crystallographic parameters for the tetragonal phase of $\\mathrm{BaFe_{2}As_{2}}$ based on provided X-ray diffraction extinction rules and structural constraints. The solution proceeds by systematically addressing each of the five parts of the problem.\n\n1.  Determination of the Bravais lattice type, encoded by the integer $L$.\nThe foremost piece of information for determining the lattice type is the general condition on systematic absences of Bragg reflections. The problem states that reflections with Miller indices $(h,k,l)$ are absent if the sum $h+k+l$ is odd. This condition can be written mathematically as: reflections are observed only if $h+k+l=2n$ for some integer $n$. This is the defining reflection condition for a body-centered lattice, denoted by the letter $I$. In a tetragonal crystal system, this corresponds to the body-centered tetragonal Bravais lattice.\nThe problem provides a coding scheme: $L=1$ for primitive tetragonal ($P$) and $L=2$ for body-centered tetragonal ($I$). Since the observed extinctions uniquely identify an $I$-lattice, the value of $L$ must be $2$.\n\n2.  Determination of the space group number, $S$.\nThe determination of the space group requires combining the information about the Bravais lattice, the crystal system, and the point group symmetry.\n-   **Lattice Type**: As determined above, the lattice is body-centered ($I$).\n-   **Crystal System**: The problem states the phase is tetragonal, with lattice metric $a=b \\neq c$.\n-   **Point Group**: The problem states the crystal is centrosymmetric, meaning its point group must possess an inversion center. For the tetragonal system, the centrosymmetric point groups (Laue classes) are $4/m$ and $4/mmm$. The problem provides an additional constraint that there is a \"mirror-symmetric stacking of $\\mathrm{FeAs}$ layers and $\\mathrm{Ba}$ layers along $c$\". This implies the existence of a mirror plane perpendicular to the $c$-axis (the $xy$-plane at $z=0$ or $z=1/2$). The presence of both an inversion center and a mirror plane perpendicular to the four-fold axis indicates the highest-symmetry point group, $4/mmm$.\nCombining the lattice symbol $I$ with the point group symbol $4/mmm$ yields the space group $I4/mmm$. Consulting the International Tables for Crystallography (ITC), the space group $I4/mmm$ is assigned the number $139$.\nThe problem also provides a second extinction rule: reflections of the form $(0,0,l)$ with odd $l$ are absent. This rule is a special case of the body-centering condition $h+k+l=2n$. For a $(0,0,l)$ reflection, this condition becomes $0+0+l = l = 2n$, meaning $l$ must be even. Thus, the second rule is redundant but consistent with the first, confirming the assignment.\nTherefore, the space group number is $S=139$.\n\n3.  Computation of the number of iron ($\\mathrm{Fe}$) atoms per primitive cell, $N$.\nThe chemical formula is $\\mathrm{BaFe_{2}As_{2}}$. The crystal structure corresponding to this formula in the space group $I4/mmm$ is the $\\mathrm{ThCr_{2}Si_{2}}$-type structure. In this structure, the atoms are located at specific Wyckoff positions within the conventional unit cell. The standard assignment is:\n-   $\\mathrm{Ba}$ at Wyckoff position $2a$: $(0,0,0)$\n-   $\\mathrm{Fe}$ at Wyckoff position $4d$: $(0,1/2,1/4)$, $(1/2,0,1/4)$\n-   $\\mathrm{As}$ at Wyckoff position $4e$: $(0,0,z)$\nThe multiplicity of a Wyckoff position indicates the number of equivalent atoms of that type within the conventional unit cell.\n-   Number of $\\mathrm{Ba}$ atoms per conventional cell = $2$.\n-   Number of $\\mathrm{Fe}$ atoms per conventional cell = $4$.\n-   Number of $\\mathrm{As}$ atoms per conventional cell = $4$.\nThe ratio $2:4:4$ simplifies to $1:2:2$, which is consistent with the chemical formula $\\mathrm{BaFe_{2}As_{2}}$. This confirms there are $Z=2$ formula units per conventional cell.\nThe problem asks for the number of iron atoms, $N$, per *primitive* cell. A body-centered ($I$) conventional cell contains $2$ lattice points, and its volume is twice that of the primitive cell. Therefore, the number of atoms in the conventional cell is twice the number in the primitive cell.\nLet $N_{\\mathrm{conv,Fe}}$ be the number of Fe atoms in the conventional cell, and $N$ be the number in the primitive cell. Then $N_{\\mathrm{conv,Fe}} = 2 \\times N$. We found $N_{\\mathrm{conv,Fe}}=4$.\n$4 = 2 \\times N \\Rightarrow N = 2$.\nSo, there are $2$ iron atoms per primitive cell.\n\n4.  Identification of the fractional $z$-coordinates $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},1}$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},2}$ of the iron layers.\nThe iron atoms occupy the Wyckoff position $4d$ of space group $I4/mmm$. The full set of coordinates for this position within the conventional cell is generated by applying the symmetry operations to the representative coordinates. The resulting positions are: $(0, 1/2, 1/4)$, $(1/2, 0, 1/4)$, $(0, 1/2, 3/4)$, and $(1/2, 0, 3/4)$.\nThese coordinates show that the iron atoms form two distinct layers perpendicular to the $c$-axis.\n-   One layer is at the fractional height $z = 1/4$, containing the atoms at $(0, 1/2, 1/4)$ and $(1/2, 0, 1/4)$.\n-   The other layer is at the fractional height $z = 3/4$, containing the atoms at $(0, 1/2, 3/4)$ and $(1/2, 0, 3/4)$.\nThus, the fractional $z$-coordinates of the two iron layers are $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},1} = 1/4$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},2} = 3/4$.\n\n5.  Expression for the signed fractional vertical separation $\\Delta z$.\nThe problem asks for the signed fractional vertical separation $\\Delta z$ between the iron layer at $z=1/4$ and the nearest arsenic plane at $z=z_{\\mathrm{As}}$. The arsenic atoms occupy the $4e$ Wyckoff position, which has coordinates $(0,0,z_{\\mathrm{As}}), (0,0,-z_{\\mathrm{As}})$, plus their body-centered equivalents. The parameter $z_{\\mathrm{As}}$ is a free variable not fixed by symmetry, and must be determined experimentally.\nThe problem defines the required quantity as $\\Delta z = z_{\\mathrm{As}} - \\frac{1}{4}$ and specifies that $\\Delta z$ is positive if $z_{\\mathrm{As}} > 1/4$. Since no information is provided to determine the numerical value of $z_{\\mathrm{As}}$, the expression for $\\Delta z$ must remain in terms of this symbolic parameter. The task is simply to state this relationship. Therefore, the expression for the separation is $\\Delta z = z_{\\mathrm{As}} - \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the values for $L$, $S$, $N$, $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},1}$, $z_{\\mathrm{Fe},2}$, and $\\Delta z$.\n$L=2$\n$S=139$\n$N=2$\n$z_{\\mathrm{Fe},1}=1/4$\n$z_{\\mathrm{Fe},2}=3/4$\n$\\Delta z = z_{\\mathrm{As}} - 1/4$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\pmatrix{\n2 & 139 & 2 & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{3}{4} & z_{\\mathrm{As}} - \\frac{1}{4}\n}\n}\n$$", "id": "2996893"}, {"introduction": "A central question for any unconventional superconductor is the symmetry of its energy gap, which reveals the nature of the Cooper pairing.

Use the causal prescription $\\omega \\to \\omega+i 0^{+}$ explicitly in your expression.", "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the interacting spin susceptibility $\\chi_{s}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega)$ for a two-orbital model under a specific set of simplifying assumptions, using the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). The calculation proceeds in two stages: first, the computation of the bare interband susceptibility $\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega)$, and second, the RPA resummation.\n\nThe problem first provides a general tight-binding Hamiltonian, then specifies a simplified \"nested limit\" for the actual calculation. This idealized limit is defined by:\n1. Two bands, a hole-like band (h) and an electron-like band (e).\n2. A perfect nesting condition between states on the Fermi surfaces of these bands, given by the relation $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{e}}(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q})=-\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{h}}(\\mathbf{k})$ for a nesting vector $\\mathbf{Q}=(\\pi,0)$.\n3. A constant total density of states (DOS) per spin for the nested pair, $N_{0}$, within an energy cutoff $\\Lambda$ around the Fermi level.\n4. Zero temperature, $T=0$.\n5. A unity interband orbital coherence factor.\n\nLet's begin by calculating the bare interband susceptibility, $\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega)$. The general expression for the bare susceptibility at $T=0$ is given by the Lindhard function, derived from the Kubo formula:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{q},\\omega) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k},\\alpha,\\beta} |M_{\\alpha\\beta}|^2 \\frac{f(\\varepsilon_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q})) - f(\\varepsilon_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{k}))}{\\omega + \\varepsilon_{\\alpha}(\\mathbf{k}) - \\varepsilon_{\\beta}(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}) + i\\eta}\n$$\nwhere $f(\\varepsilon)$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, which is a step function at $T=0$. The chemical potential is set to $0$, so $f(\\varepsilon)=1$ for $\\varepsilon<0$ and $f(\\varepsilon)=0$ for $\\varepsilon>0$. The parameter $\\eta$ is an infinitesimal positive quantity, corresponding to the problem's $0^{+}$ prescription. The matrix element $M_{\\alpha\\beta}$ for the interband transition ($\\alpha \\neq \\beta$) is given as unity. We are interested in $\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{Q}$.\n\nWe are considering transitions between the hole band (h) and the electron band (e). Let $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{h}}(\\mathbf{k}) \\equiv \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$. The nesting condition is $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{e}}(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q})=-\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$. Substituting these into the Lindhard formula for the interband contribution at $\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{Q}$:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\frac{f(-\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}) - f(\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}})}{\\omega + \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} - (-\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}) + i\\eta} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\frac{f(-\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}) - f(\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}})}{\\omega + 2\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} + i\\eta}\n$$\nThe term $f(-\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}) - f(\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}})$ in the numerator is non-zero only for $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} \\neq 0$:\n- If $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} < 0$, the state is an occupied hole state. Then $-\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} > 0$. The numerator is $f(-\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}) - f(\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}) = 0 - 1 = -1$. This corresponds to exciting an electron from the hole band to the electron band.\n- If $\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} > 0$, the state is an empty hole state. Then $-\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} < 0$. The numerator is $f(-\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}) - f(\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}) = 1 - 0 = 1$. This corresponds to exciting an electron from the electron band to the hole band.\n\nThe sum is converted into an energy integral using the constant density of states, $N_{0}$. The DOS $N_{0}$ is for the pair of nested bands, so we integrate over $\\xi$ from $-\\Lambda$ to $\\Lambda$.\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega) = N_{0} \\int_{-\\Lambda}^{\\Lambda} d\\xi \\frac{f(-\\xi) - f(\\xi)}{\\omega + 2\\xi + i\\eta}\n$$\nWe split the integral into two parts: $\\xi \\in [-\\Lambda, 0)$ and $\\xi \\in (0, \\Lambda]$.\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega) = N_{0} \\left( \\int_{-\\Lambda}^{0} \\frac{-1}{\\omega + 2\\xi + i\\eta} d\\xi + \\int_{0}^{\\Lambda} \\frac{1}{\\omega + 2\\xi + i\\eta} d\\xi \\right)\n$$\nIn the first integral, let $\\xi' = -\\xi$. Then $d\\xi = -d\\xi'$, and the limits go from $\\Lambda$ to $0$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\Lambda}^{0} \\frac{-1}{\\omega + 2\\xi + i\\eta} d\\xi = \\int_{\\Lambda}^{0} \\frac{-1}{\\omega - 2\\xi' + i\\eta} (-d\\xi') = \\int_{\\Lambda}^{0} \\frac{1}{\\omega - 2\\xi' + i\\eta} d\\xi' = -\\int_{0}^{\\Lambda} \\frac{1}{\\omega - 2\\xi' + i\\eta} d\\xi'\n$$\nCombining the two parts (and renaming $\\xi'$ back to $\\xi$):\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega) = N_{0} \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\Lambda} \\frac{1}{\\omega + 2\\xi + i\\eta} d\\xi - \\int_{0}^{\\Lambda} \\frac{1}{\\omega - 2\\xi + i\\eta} d\\xi \\right)\n$$\nWe combine the integrands:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\omega + 2\\xi + i\\eta} - \\frac{1}{\\omega - 2\\xi + i\\eta} = \\frac{(\\omega - 2\\xi + i\\eta) - (\\omega + 2\\xi + i\\eta)}{(\\omega + i\\eta)^2 - (2\\xi)^2} = \\frac{-4\\xi}{(\\omega + i\\eta)^2 - 4\\xi^2}\n$$\nSo the susceptibility is given by the integral:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega) = N_{0} \\int_{0}^{\\Lambda} \\frac{-4\\xi}{(\\omega + i\\eta)^2 - 4\\xi^2} d\\xi\n$$\nThis integral can be solved directly. Let $u = (\\omega + i\\eta)^2 - 4\\xi^2$, so $du = -8\\xi d\\xi$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega) = N_{0} \\int_{\\xi=0}^{\\xi=\\Lambda} \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{u} = \\frac{N_{0}}{2} \\left[ \\ln(u) \\right]_{\\xi=0}^{\\xi=\\Lambda} = \\frac{N_{0}}{2} \\left[ \\ln((\\omega + i\\eta)^2 - 4\\xi^2) \\right]_{0}^{\\Lambda}\n$$\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega) = \\frac{N_{0}}{2} \\left( \\ln((\\omega + i\\eta)^2 - 4\\Lambda^2) - \\ln((\\omega + i\\eta)^2) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega) = \\frac{N_{0}}{2} \\ln\\left( \\frac{(\\omega + i\\eta)^2 - 4\\Lambda^2}{(\\omega + i\\eta)^2} \\right) = \\frac{N_{0}}{2} \\ln\\left( 1 - \\frac{4\\Lambda^2}{(\\omega + i\\eta)^2} \\right)\n$$\nReplacing $\\eta$ with the $0^{+}$ notation from the problem statement, we have the bare susceptibility:\n$$\n\\chi_{0}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega) = \\frac{N_{0}}{2} \\ln\\left( 1 - \\frac{4\\Lambda^2}{(\\omega+i 0^{+})^2} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we use the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) to find the interacting spin susceptibility $\\chi_{s}(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega)$.
