Calculation of the in-plane lattice constant ($a$)**\n\nThe problem describes a single S–Mo–S trilayer. The Mo atoms form a triangular lattice, and the S atoms are positioned directly above and below the centers of the triangles formed by Mo atoms. Within this structure, the Mo–S bond, of length $d_{\\mathrm{MoS}}$, can be viewed as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.\n\nThe two legs of this right-angled triangle are:\ni. A vertical component, which is the perpendicular distance from the molybdenum atomic plane to either sulfur atomic plane. Given the total S–Mo–S trilayer thickness is $t$, this distance is $t/2$.\nii. A horizontal component, which is the lateral projection of the Mo–S bond onto the plane of the molybdenum atoms. Let us denote this projection as $p$.\n\nAccording to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship between these quantities is:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{MoS}}^2 = p^2 + \\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2$$\nWe can solve for the lateral projection $p$:\n$$p = \\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{MoS}}^2 - \\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2}$$\nThe problem states that this lateral projection $p$ is equal to the distance from a vertex (a Mo atom) to the centroid of an equilateral triangle whose side length is the in-plane lattice constant $a$. For an equilateral triangle of side $a$, this distance is given by the geometric relation:\n$$p = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nBy equating the two expressions for $p$, we can derive a formula for $a$:\n$$\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{MoS}}^2 - \\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2}$$\n$$a = \\sqrt{3} \\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{MoS}}^2 - \\left(\\frac{t}{2}\\right)^2}$$\nSubstituting the given values $d_{\\mathrm{MoS}} = 2.42\\,\\text{\\AA}$ and $t = 3.10\\,\\text{\\AA}$:\n$$a = \\sqrt{3} \\sqrt{(2.42)^2 - \\left(\\frac{3.10}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{3} \\sqrt{5.8564 - (1.55)^2}$$\n$$a = \\sqrt{3} \\sqrt{5.8564 - 2.4025} = \\sqrt{3} \\sqrt{3.4539} \\approx 3.2190\\,\\text{\\AA}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the in-plane lattice constant is $a \\approx 3.22\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the out-of-plane lattice constant ($c$)**\n\nThe $2\\mathrm{H}$ polytype of $\\mathrm{MoS}_2$ has a unit cell that contains two S–Mo–S trilayers stacked along the $c$-axis. The out-of-plane lattice constant $c$ is the total height of this two-trilayer unit cell.\n\nThe height of the unit cell is twice the distance between the centers of adjacent trilayers (i.e., the Mo-plane to Mo-plane distance). Let this distance be $h_{\\mathrm{Mo-Mo}}$.\n$$c = 2 h_{\\mathrm{Mo-Mo}}$$\nThe distance $h_{\\mathrm{Mo-Mo}}$ is composed of the spacing within a trilayer and the spacing between trilayers. Specifically, from the Mo plane of one layer to the Mo plane of the next, one must traverse the vertical distance from the first Mo plane to its upper S plane ($t/2$), cross the interlayer van der Waals gap ($g$), and then traverse the vertical distance from the second layer's lower S plane to its Mo plane ($t/2$).\nThe distance between the molybdenum planes is therefore $h_{\\mathrm{Mo-Mo}} = \\frac{t}{2} + g + \\frac{t}{2} = t + g$.\nThus, the out-of-plane lattice constant is given by:\n$$c = 2(t + g)$$\nThe problem defines the interlayer sulfur–sulfur separation (the van der Waals gap) as $g = 2\\,r_{\\mathrm{vdW}}(\\mathrm{S})$.\n$$c = 2(t + 2\\,r_{\\mathrm{vdW}}(\\mathrm{S}))$$\nSubstituting the given values $t = 3.10\\,\\text{\\AA}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{vdW}}(\\mathrm{S}) = 1.80\\,\\text{\\AA}$:\n$$c = 2(3.10 + 2 \\times 1.80) = 2(3.10 + 3.60) = 2(6.70) = 13.4\\,\\text{\\AA}$$\nThis result has three significant figures as given by the input parameters. The out-of-plane lattice constant is $c = 13.4\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the anisotropy ratio ($c/a$)**\n\nThe anisotropy ratio is the dimensionless ratio of the out-of-plane lattice constant to the in-plane lattice constant.

We need to find the effective form of this Hamiltonian when projected onto the two-fold spin-degenerate subspace of the valence band edge at the $K$ point.\n\nLet the basis for this subspace be $\\{|v, K, \\uparrow\\rangle, |v, K, \\downarrow\\rangle\\}$, where $|v, K\\rangle$ denotes the orbital part of the Bloch state and $|\\uparrow\\rangle, |\\downarrow\\rangle$ are the spin-up and spin-down states, quantized along the out-of-plane axis, $z$. The effective Hamiltonian will be a $2 \\times 2$ matrix in this spin basis.\n\nThe general form of a $2 \\times 2$ Hamiltonian is $H^{\\text{eff}} = c_0 I + \\mathbf{c} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=(\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ are the Pauli matrices, and the coefficients are determined by projecting $H_{\\mathrm{SO}}$ onto the basis.\n\nThe problem states that the valence band at $K$ arises from metal $d$-orbitals that carry a finite out-of-plane orbital angular momentum. This implies that the expectation value of the $z$-component of the orbital angular momentum, $\\langle v, K|L_z|v, K\\rangle$, is non-zero. The point group symmetry at the $K$ point is $D_{3h}$. Under the $C_3$ rotation symmetry of this group about the $z$-axis, the in-plane components $(L_x, L_y)$ transform as a vector and are not invariant, while $L_z$ is a scalar and is invariant. Consequently, their expectation values within the non-degenerate (orbital-wise) state $|v, K\\rangle$ must be zero: $\\langle v, K|L_x|v, K\\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle v, K|L_y|v, K\\rangle = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the projection of $H_{\\mathrm{SO}}$ simplifies considerably:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{SO}, v, K}^{\\text{eff}} = \\text{proj}_{v,K} (\\lambda (L_x S_x + L_y S_y + L_z S_z)) \\text{proj}_{v,K}\n$$\nThe terms $L_x S_x$ and $L_y S_y$ involve operators that flip the spin. For example, $\\langle \\uparrow | L_x S_x | \\downarrow \\rangle \\propto \\langle v,K|L_x|v,K \\rangle$. Since the first-order expectation values $\\langle L_x \\rangle$ and $\\langle L_y \\rangle$ are zero, these terms do not contribute at leading order. The only surviving term is the one involving $L_z S_z$.\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{SO}, v, K}^{\\text{eff}} \\approx \\lambda \\langle v, K|L_z|v, K\\rangle S_z\n$$\nThis effective Hamiltonian is diagonal in the spin-z basis. Let's represent $S_z$ in matrix form as $S_z \\rightarrow \\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\sigma_z$. For a dimensionless formulation, we can use $S_z \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_z$. The quantity $\\lambda \\langle v, K|L_z|v, K\\rangle$ is a product of microscopic parameters that results in an energy.\n\nNow, we must consider the constraints imposed by the fundamental symmetries: broken inversion symmetry ($\\mathcal{P}$) and preserved time-reversal symmetry ($\\mathcal{T}$). The valley index $\\tau$ distinguishes the $K$ ($\\tau=+1$) and $K'$ ($\\tau=-1$) valleys. The state at valley $K'$ is the time-reversal partner of the state at valley $K$. The operator $\\mathbf{L}$ is odd under time reversal, so $\\langle L_z \\rangle_{K'} = \\langle v, K'|L_z|v, K'\\rangle = - \\langle v, K|L_z|v, K\\rangle = -\\langle L_z \\rangle_K$. This means the effective orbital magnetic moment is opposite in the two valleys.\n\nWe can write the effective Hamiltonian for a general valley $\\tau$ as:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{SO}, v, \\tau}^{\\text{eff}} \\propto \\tau S_z\n$$\nLet's define the effective Hamiltonian in terms of the single parameter $\\lambda_v$ given in the problem. A common form for the effective SOC Hamiltonian in a two-level spin system is $H = C \\sigma_z$. The eigenvalues are $\\pm C$, leading to a splitting of $2C$. Given the numerical values provided, where the parameter $\\lambda_v$ is approximately half the known experimental splitting, it is logical to define the effective Hamiltonian as:\n$$\nH_{\\mathrm{SO}, v, \\tau}^{\\text{eff}} = \\lambda_v \\tau \\sigma_z\n$$\nThis is the derived leading-order effective SOC term permitted by symmetry. This form is consistent with time-reversal symmetry, as it connects the two valleys: $\\mathcal{T} H_{\\text{eff}}(K) \\mathcal{T}^{-1} = \\mathcal{T} (\\lambda_v \\sigma_z) \\mathcal{T}^{-1} = \\lambda_v (-\\sigma_z) = H_{\\text{eff}}(K')$.\n\n### Step 2: Analytic Expression for Spin Splitting $\\Delta_v(K)$\n\nUsing the derived effective Hamiltonian for the $K$ valley ($\\tau=+1$), $H_{\\mathrm{SO}, v, K}^{\\text{eff}} = \\lambda_v \\sigma_z$, we find its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of $\\sigma_z$ are $+1$ (for spin-up, $|\\uparrow\\rangle$) and $-1$ (for spin-down, $|\\downarrow\\rangle$). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n$$\nE_{\\uparrow} = +\\lambda_v\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\downarrow} = -\\lambda_v\n$$\nThe spin splitting $\\Delta_v(K)$ is the absolute difference between these energy levels:\n$$\n\\Delta_v(K) = |E_{\\uparrow} - E_{\\downarrow}| = |\\lambda_v - (-\\lambda_v)| = |2\\lambda_v|\n$$\nSince SOC parameters like $\\lambda_v$ represent energy scales and are taken to be positive, the analytic expression for the spin splitting is:\n$$\n\\Delta_v(K) = 2\\lambda_v\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Role of Symmetries\n\n- **Broken Inversion Symmetry**: For a system to exhibit spin splitting $\\mathbf{\\Delta E} \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(\\mathbf{k}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ at a wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$, the effective SOC field $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(\\mathbf{k})$ must be non-zero. Time-reversal symmetry requires that $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(-\\mathbf{k}) = -\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(\\mathbf{k})$. If inversion symmetry were also present, it would require $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(-\\mathbf{k}) = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(\\mathbf{k})$. The only function that is simultaneously odd and even is the zero function, $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(\\mathbf{k}) = 0$. Thus, in centrosymmetric crystals, spin splitting is forbidden (Kramers' degeneracy holds at every $\\mathbf{k}$). In monolayer TMDs, inversion symmetry is broken, so the constraint $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(-\\mathbf{k}) = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(\\mathbf{k})$ is lifted, allowing for $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}(\\mathbf{k}) \\neq 0$ and thus a non-zero spin splitting $\\Delta_v(K)$.\n\n- **Time-Reversal Symmetry and Valley-Contrasting Spin**: As shown in the derivation, time-reversal symmetry connects the Hamiltonians at the $K$ and $K'$ valleys via $H_{\\text{eff}}(K') = \\mathcal{T} H_{\\text{eff}}(K) \\mathcal{T}^{-1}$. With $H_{\\text{eff}}(K) = \\lambda_v \\sigma_z$, this leads to $H_{\\text{eff}}(K') = -\\lambda_v \\sigma_z$. This means the sign of the spin splitting is opposite in the two valleys. At the $K$ valley, the spin-up state has energy $+\\lambda_v$ and spin-down has $-\\lambda_v$. At the $K'$ valley, the spin-up state has energy $-\\lambda_v$ and spin-down has $+\\lambda_v$. The ordering of the spin states is reversed, which is the signature of valley-contrasting spin configurations. The magnitude of the splitting, $2\\lambda_v$, remains the same in both valleys.\n\n### Step 4: Numerical Evaluation for $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ and $\\mathrm{WS}_{2}$\n\nUsing the derived expression $\\Delta_v(K) = 2\\lambda_v$ and the provided parameters:\n\n- For $\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$: $\\lambda_{v}^{\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}} = 75\\ \\mathrm{meV}$\n$$\n\\Delta_{v}(K)_{\\mathrm{MoS}_{2}} = 2 \\times 75\\ \\mathrm{meV} = 150\\ \\mathrm{meV}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $150.0\\ \\mathrm{meV}$.\n\n- For $\\mathrm{WS}_{2}$: $\\lambda_{v}^{\\mathrm{WS}_{2}} = 215\\ \\mathrm{meV}$\n$$\n\\Delta_{v}(K)_{\\mathrm{WS}_{2}} = 2 \\times 215\\ \\mathrm{meV} = 430\\ \\mathrm{meV}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $430.0\\ \\mathrm{meV}$.\n\n### Step 5: Qualitative Trend\n\nThe strength of atomic spin-orbit coupling increases sharply with atomic number ($Z$), roughly as $Z^4$ for hydrogen-like atoms and somewhat less steeply for multi-electron atoms. The transition metals Molybdenum (Mo, $Z=42$) and Tungsten (W, $Z=74$) are in the same group of the periodic table, but W is in a higher period and is significantly heavier. The effective SOC parameter $\\lambda_v$ is directly proportional to the microscopic atomic SOC strength. Therefore, the spin splitting $\\Delta_v(K)$ is substantially larger in TMDs with heavier transition metals. The qualitative trend is that for a given chalcogen $\\mathrm{X}$, the valence band spin splitting in $\\mathrm{WX}_{2}$ is much larger than in $\\mathrm{MoX}_{2}$. This is confirmed by our calculation: $\\Delta_v(\\mathrm{WS}_2) = 430.0 \\ \\mathrm{meV} > \\Delta_v(\\mathrm{MoS}_2) = 150.0 \\ \\mathrm{meV}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 150.0 & 430.0 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3022332"}, {"introduction": "An understanding of a material's electronic structure is truly powerful when it can predict how that material interacts with light.

In optical transitions at visible frequencies in solids, the photon crystal momentum is negligible compared to reciprocal lattice vectors, so absorption is essentially vertical in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. Therefore, the electron and hole participating in a bright exciton must originate from the same crystal momentum within the same valley, and the exciton center-of-mass momentum must be $Q \\approx 0$.

The momentum mismatch $\\Delta \\mathbf{k} \\approx \\mathbf{Q} - \\mathbf{K} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ cannot be supplied by the photon in the long-wavelength limit. Such excitons can recombine by emitting a photon only with assistance from a phonon or disorder to supply the required momentum. In zero-phonon optical absorption, this exciton is dark due to momentum-indirect character. Verdict — Correct.\n\nD. An intervalley exciton with electron at $\\mathbf{K}'$ and hole at $\\mathbf{K}$ claimed to be bright because of time-reversal symmetry. Time-reversal symmetry relates the $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K}'$ valleys but does not supply the finite crystal momentum $\\Delta \\mathbf{k} \\approx \\mathbf{K}' - \\mathbf{K}$ required for the transition. The photon cannot bridge this momentum, so without phonon or disorder assistance, intervalley excitons are dark in zero-phonon absorption. The assertion that time-reversal symmetry alone makes it bright is incorrect. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. A direct $\\mathbf{K}$-valley exciton that couples only via out-of-plane polarization ($\\hat{p}_z$). Because both $\\lvert v,\\mathbf{K} \\rangle$ and $\\lvert c,\\mathbf{K} \\rangle$ are even under $\\sigma_h$ and $\\hat{p}_z$ is odd, the matrix element $\\langle c,\\mathbf{K} \\rvert \\hat{p}_z \\lvert v,\\mathbf{K} \\rangle$ vanishes by symmetry, rendering such a transition dark in zero-phonon optical absorption. Verdict — Correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are A, B, C, and E.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "3022428"}]}
