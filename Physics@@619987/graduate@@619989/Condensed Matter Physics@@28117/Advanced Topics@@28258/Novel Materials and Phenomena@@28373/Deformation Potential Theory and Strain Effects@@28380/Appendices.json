A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe relationship between the stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ and the strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}$ in linear elasticity is given by Hooke's Law. For a problem where stress is specified and strain is the unknown, it is most direct to use the compliance formulation:\n$$ \\epsilon_{ij} = \\sum_{k,l} S_{ijkl} \\sigma_{kl} $$\nwhere $S_{ijkl}$ is the fourth-rank elastic compliance tensor. For a cubic crystal, this relationship can be simplified using the Voigt notation, where the strain components $\\epsilon_i$ are related to the stress components $\\sigma_j$ via a $6 \\times 6$ compliance matrix $S_{ij}$. The relations for the tensor components are:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx} = S_{11}\\sigma_{xx} + S_{12}\\sigma_{yy} + S_{12}\\sigma_{zz} $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yy} = S_{12}\\sigma_{xx} + S_{11}\\sigma_{yy} + S_{12}\\sigma_{zz} $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = S_{12}\\sigma_{xx} + S_{12}\\sigma_{yy} + S_{11}\\sigma_{zz} $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yz} = \\frac{1}{2} S_{44} \\sigma_{yz} $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zx} = \\frac{1}{2} S_{44} \\sigma_{zx} $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{xy} = \\frac{1}{2} S_{44} \\sigma_{xy} $$\nThe factor of $1/2$ for shear components arises from the definition of the symmetric strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}$, as opposed to engineering shear strain $\\gamma_{ij} = 2\\epsilon_{ij}$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nThe problem states that a uniaxial stress $\\sigma$ is applied along the $[001]$ or $z$-axis. The stress tensor is therefore:\n$$ \\sigma_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\sigma \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSo, $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma$, and all other components of the stress tensor are zero. Substituting these into the compliance equations gives:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx} = S_{12}\\sigma $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yy} = S_{12}\\sigma $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = S_{11}\\sigma $$\nSince all shear stress components ($\\sigma_{yz}$, $\\sigma_{zx}$, $\\sigma_{xy}$) are zero, the corresponding shear strain components are also zero:\n$$ \\epsilon_{yz} = 0, \\quad \\epsilon_{zx} = 0, \\quad \\epsilon_{xy} = 0 $$\nNote that by symmetry of the setup (uniaxial stress along an axis of a cubic crystal), we find $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon_{yy}$, as expected.\n\nThe compliance constants $S_{11}$ and $S_{12}$ for a cubic crystal are related to the stiffness constants $C_{11}$ and $C_{12}$ by the following formulas:\n$$ S_{11} = \\frac{C_{11}+C_{12}}{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})} $$\n$$ S_{12} = \\frac{-C_{12}}{(C_{11}-C_{12})(C_{11}+2C_{12})} $$\nThe given values are $\\sigma = 2.50$ GPa, $C_{11} = 210$ GPa, and $C_{12} = 125$ GPa.

It is a standard problem in condensed matter physics concerning the effects of strain on the electronic properties of semiconductors. All necessary data are provided, and the physical model is standard. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the determination of strain components and the consequent shift in the conduction band edge for a pseudomorphically strained semiconductor film. The film is cubic with a $(001)$ orientation, grown on a cubic substrate.\n\nFirst, we determine the in-plane strain components. A coherently strained pseudomorphic film grown epitaxially on a substrate has its in-plane lattice parameters constrained to match those of the substrate. The strain tensor components $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ are defined with respect to the unstrained film. The principal axes of the strain tensor are aligned with the crystal axes, so we only need to consider the diagonal components $\\varepsilon_{xx}$, $\\varepsilon_{yy}$, and $\\varepsilon_{zz}$. For a $(001)$ film, the in-plane directions are $x \\equiv [100]$ and $y \\equiv [010]$, and the out-of-plane direction is $z \\equiv [001]$.\n\nThe in-plane strain components $\\varepsilon_{1} = \\varepsilon_{xx}$ and $\\varepsilon_{2} = \\varepsilon_{yy}$ are given by the relative difference between the substrate lattice parameter $a_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ (which is the strained in-plane lattice parameter of the film) and the unstrained film lattice parameter $a_{\\mathrm{film}}$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{1} = \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{sub}} - a_{\\mathrm{film}}}{a_{\\mathrm{film}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{2} = \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{sub}} - a_{\\mathrm{film}}}{a_{\\mathrm{film}}}\n$$\nDue to the cubic symmetry of the substrate and the film grown on the $(001)$ plane, the in-plane strain is biaxial and isotropic, i.e., $\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\varepsilon_{yy}$. This quantity is given as the lattice mismatch $\\Delta a/a$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{1} = \\varepsilon_{2} = \\frac{\\Delta a}{a} = +0.008\n$$\nThis is a tensile in-plane strain. We shall denote the in-plane strain as $\\varepsilon_{\\parallel} = \\varepsilon_{1} = \\varepsilon_{2}$.\n\nNext, we determine the out-of-plane strain $\\varepsilon_{3} = \\varepsilon_{zz}$. The film is thin and free to expand or contract in the out-of-plane $(z)$ direction. This corresponds to the plane-stress condition, where the stress component normal to the surface is zero: $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{3} = 0$.\n\nWe first use the isotropic elasticity description. Generalized Hooke's law for an isotropic material relates the strain components $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ to the stress components $\\sigma_{ij}$ via Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.

The change in the band gap energy, $\\Delta E_g$, is given by the difference in the shifts of the conduction and valence band edges:\n$$\\Delta E_g = \\Delta E_c - \\Delta E_v$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the shifts of the band edges are proportional to the trace of the strain tensor, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\epsilon)$, with the proportionality constants being the hydrostatic deformation potentials $a_c$ and $a_v$:\n$$\\Delta E_c = a_c \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\epsilon)$$\n$$\\Delta E_v = a_v \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\epsilon)$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $\\Delta E_g$, we find:\n$$\\Delta E_g = a_c \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\epsilon) - a_v \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\epsilon) = (a_c - a_v) \\cdot \\mathrm{Tr}(\\epsilon)$$\nThe quantity we seek, $a_c - a_v$, is the hydrostatic deformation potential of the band gap.\n\nNext, we relate the trace of the strain tensor to the applied hydrostatic pressure $P$. For a hydrostatic pressure, the strain is isotropic. The strain tensor $\\epsilon$ is diagonal with equal components, $\\epsilon_{ij} = \\epsilon \\delta_{ij}$. The trace of the strain tensor is the sum of its diagonal elements:\n$$\\mathrm{Tr}(\\epsilon) = \\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} + \\epsilon_{zz} = 3\\epsilon$$\nThe trace of the strain tensor is also equal to the volumetric strain, $\\frac{\\Delta V}{V}$, in the limit of small strains. The problem provides the relationship between volumetric strain, pressure $P$, and the bulk modulus $B$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta V}{V} = -\\frac{P}{B}$$\nTherefore, we can write:\n$$\\mathrm{Tr}(\\epsilon) = -\\frac{P}{B}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\epsilon)$ into the equation for the band gap shift:\n$$\\Delta E_g = (a_c - a_v) \\left(-\\frac{P}{B}\\right)$$\nThe band gap energy at a pressure $P$, denoted as $E_g(P)$, is the sum of the band gap at zero pressure, $E_g(0)$, and the shift $\\Delta E_g$:\n$$E_g(P) = E_g(0) + \\Delta E_g = E_g(0) - (a_c - a_v) \\frac{P}{B}$$\nThe problem states that the photoluminescence peak energy $E_{\\mathrm{PL}}(P)$ tracks the band gap $E_g(P)$. This implies that the change in PL energy is equal to the change in the band gap, so we can write:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{PL}}(P) = E_{\\mathrm{PL}}(0) - (a_c - a_v) \\frac{P}{B}$$\nThis equation shows a linear relationship between $E_{\\mathrm{PL}}(P)$ and $P$. We can identify the slope of this relationship, $\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{PL}}}{dP}$, as:\n$$\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{PL}}}{dP} = - \\frac{a_c - a_v}{B}$$\nFrom this, we can derive the expression for the hydrostatic deformation potential difference:\n$$a_c - a_v = -B \\cdot \\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{PL}}}{dP}$$\nNow we must calculate the slope $\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{PL}}}{dP}$ from the experimental data. The data points are $(P, E_{\\mathrm{PL}})$: $(0.0 \\text{ GPa}, 1.425 \\text{ eV})$, $(0.5 \\text{ GPa}, 1.474 \\text{ eV})$, $(1.0 \\text{ GPa}, 1.523 \\text{ eV})$, $(1.5 \\text{ GPa}, 1.572 \\text{ eV})$, and $(2.0 \\text{ GPa}, 1.621 \\text{ eV})$. We can use a linear least-squares fit, but upon inspection, the data is perfectly linear. The change in energy, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{PL}}$, for each pressure step of $\\Delta P = 0.5$ GPa is constant:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{PL}} = 1.474 \\text{ eV} - 1.425 \\text{ eV} = 0.049 \\text{ eV}$$\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{PL}} = 1.523 \\text{ eV} - 1.474 \\text{ eV} = 0.049 \\text{ eV}$$\n... and so on.\nThe slope is therefore constant and can be computed from any two points. For instance, using the first and last points:\n$$\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{PL}}}{dP} = \\frac{1.621 \\text{ eV} - 1.425 \\text{ eV}}{2.0 \\text{ GPa} - 0.0 \\text{ GPa}} = \\frac{0.196 \\text{ eV}}{2.0 \\text{ GPa}} = 0.098 \\: \\frac{\\text{eV}}{\\text{GPa}}$$\nThe slope has units of eV/GPa. We are given the bulk modulus $B=76$ GPa. We can now compute the value of $a_c - a_v$:\n$$a_c - a_v = -(76 \\text{ GPa}) \\cdot \\left(0.098 \\: \\frac{\\text{eV}}{\\text{GPa}}\\right)$$\n$$a_c - a_v = -7.448 \\text{ eV}$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $-7.448$ already has four significant figures. This value is negative, which is typical for most direct-gap zincblende semiconductors, as pressure generally increases the direct band gap. A negative value for $a_c - a_v$ combined with the negative sign in the pressure term $-\\frac{P}{B}$ results in a positive shift $\\Delta E_g > 0$, consistent with the data. The calculated value is reasonably close to the provided context range of $-8.0$ eV to $-8.5$ eV for similar materials.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-7.448}$$", "id": "2980868"}]}
