The tasks require standard, formalizable derivations and calculations based on quantum mechanics and perturbation theory.\n\nThe problem consists of two tasks. We will address them in sequence.\n\n**Task 1: Operator Form of Interlayer Bias**\n\nThe first task is to derive the operator form of a uniform interlayer bias $U$ within the Bistritzer–MacDonald Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{BM}}$.\n\nAn electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$ couples to the charge density of the system. For an electron with charge $q = -e$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, the potential energy added to the Hamiltonian is $V(\\mathbf{r}) = -e\\phi(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nA uniform interlayer bias implies a constant potential difference between the two graphene layers. Let the electric potential on layer $1$ be $\\phi_1$ and on layer $2$ be $\\phi_2$. The potential difference is $\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_1 - \\phi_2$. The problem denotes the \"constant potential difference\" by $U$. This is often used in the literature to refer directly to the potential *energy* difference for an electron, which has units of energy. Let us define the parameter $U$ as the potential energy on layer $1$ minus the potential energy on layer $2$.\n\nTo achieve this energy difference, we can symmetrically apply a potential energy of $+U/2$ to all electrons in layer $1$ and $-U/2$ to all electrons in layer $2$. The total potential energy difference between the layers is then $(+U/2) - (-U/2) = U$. A constant overall energy shift of both layers has no effect on the physics of band splitting and can be ignored.\n\nThe Hamiltonian acts on a space that includes the layer degree of freedom. This two-dimensional \"layer pseudospin\" space is spanned by the basis vectors $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$, which represent an electron localized on layer $1$ and layer $2$, respectively. A standard representation for these basis vectors is:\n$$ |1\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad |2\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nAn operator that adds an energy of $+U/2$ to states in layer $1$ and $-U/2$ to states in layer $2$ takes the form of a diagonal matrix in this basis:\n$$ H_{\\text{bias}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{U}{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\frac{U}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis $2 \\times 2$ matrix can be expressed as a linear combination of the identity matrix $I$ and the Pauli matrices $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = (\\tau_x, \\tau_y, \\tau_z)$. The relevant Pauli matrix is $\\tau_z$:\n$$ \\tau_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nBy inspection, we can write the bias Hamiltonian as:\n$$ H_{\\text{bias}} = \\frac{U}{2} \\tau_z $$\nThis is the operator form by which a uniform interlayer bias $U$ enters the Bistritzer–MacDonald Hamiltonian. It acts as a diagonal operator in the layer pseudospin basis, coupling to the $\\tau_z$ component of the pseudospin, which distinguishes between the two layers. This completes the first task.\n\n**Task 2: Band Splitting at $\\Gamma_m$**\n\nThe second task is to compute the leading-order band splitting $\\Delta E(\\Gamma_m)$ induced by the bias $U$, using degenerate perturbation theory.\n\nThe unperturbed system has a twofold degenerate doublet $\\{|\\psi_{+}\\rangle,\\,|\\psi_{-}\\rangle\\,\\}$ at energy $E_{0}$. These states are defined as eigenstates of the layer-exchange operator, which is proportional to $\\tau_x$. We can set the layer-exchange operator to be $\\tau_x$ without loss of generality (any sign or phase factor can be absorbed into the definition of the Pauli matrices or the basis states). Thus, the unperturbed basis states satisfy:\n$$ \\tau_x |\\psi_{\\pm}\\rangle = \\pm 1 |\\psi_{\\pm}\\rangle $$\nThese states are orthonormal: $\\langle\\psi_i|\\psi_j\\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$ for $i,j \\in \\{+,-\\}$.\n\nThe perturbation is the bias Hamiltonian derived in the first part:\n$$ H' = H_{\\text{bias}} = \\frac{U}{2} \\tau_z $$\nTo find the energy splitting to first order, we must diagonalize the perturbation matrix $W$ constructed within the degenerate subspace spanned by $\\{|\\psi_{+}\\rangle,\\,|\\psi_{-}\\rangle\\,\\}$. The elements of this matrix are given by $W_{ij} = \\langle \\psi_i | H' | \\psi_j \\rangle$:\n$$ W = \\begin{pmatrix} \\langle \\psi_+ | H' | \\psi_+ \\rangle & \\langle \\psi_+ | H' | \\psi_- \\rangle \\\\ \\langle \\psi_- | H' | \\psi_+ \\rangle & \\langle \\psi_- | H' | \\psi_- \\rangle \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{U}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} \\langle \\psi_+ | \\tau_z | \\psi_+ \\rangle & \\langle \\psi_+ | \\tau_z | \\psi_- \\rangle \\\\ \\langle \\psi_- | \\tau_z | \\psi_+ \\rangle & \\langle \\psi_- | \\tau_z | \\psi_- \\rangle \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe now compute these matrix elements.\n\nFirst, consider the diagonal elements, e.g., $\\langle \\psi_+ | \\tau_z | \\psi_+ \\rangle$. The layer pseudospin operators $\\tau_x$ and $\\tau_z$ are Pauli matrices and therefore anticommute: $\\tau_x \\tau_z = -\\tau_z \\tau_x$. Let's examine the state $\\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle$:\n$$ \\tau_x (\\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle) = -\\tau_z (\\tau_x |\\psi_+\\rangle) = -\\tau_z (|\\psi_+\\rangle) = -1 (\\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle) $$\nThis shows that the state $\\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $\\tau_x$ with eigenvalue $-1$. Therefore, $\\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle$ must be proportional to $|\\psi_-\\rangle$. Since eigenstates of a Hermitian operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, the state $\\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle$ must be orthogonal to $|\\psi_+\\rangle$. Consequently, the inner product is zero:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_+ | \\tau_z | \\psi_+ \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_+ | (\\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle) = 0 $$\nBy the same logic, $\\tau_z |\\psi_-\\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $\\tau_x$ with eigenvalue $+1$, so it is orthogonal to $|\\psi_-\\rangle$. Thus:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_- | \\tau_z | \\psi_- \\rangle = 0 $$\nThe diagonal elements of the perturbation matrix $W$ are both zero.\n\nNext, consider the off-diagonal elements. As shown above, $\\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle$ is proportional to $|\\psi_-\\rangle$. We can write $\\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle = c |\\psi_-\\rangle$ for some complex constant $c$. Since the states are normalized and $\\tau_z$ is unitary $(\\tau_z^\\dagger \\tau_z = I)$, we have $|\\!| \\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle |\\!|^2 = \\langle \\psi_+ | \\tau_z^\\dagger \\tau_z | \\psi_+ \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_+ | \\psi_+ \\rangle = 1$. Also, $|\\!| c |\\psi_-\\rangle |\\!|^2 = |c|^2 \\langle \\psi_- | \\psi_- \\rangle = |c|^2$. Thus, we must have $|c|=1$. The constant $c$ is a phase factor, $c = e^{i\\alpha}$. This phase depends on the relative phase chosen for the basis vectors $|\\psi_+\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_-\\rangle$. We are free to redefine $|\\psi_-\\rangle \\to e^{-i\\alpha}|\\psi_-\\rangle$ without changing its physical properties (it remains a normalized eigenstate of $\\tau_x$ with eigenvalue $-1$). With this choice, we get $c=1$. So, we can work in a basis where:\n$$ \\tau_z |\\psi_+\\rangle = |\\psi_-\\rangle \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau_z |\\psi_-\\rangle = |\\psi_+\\rangle $$\n(The second relation follows from applying $\\tau_z$ to the first and using $\\tau_z^2=I$).\n\nNow we can compute the off-diagonal matrix elements:\n$$ W_{+-} = \\langle \\psi_+ | H' | \\psi_- \\rangle = \\frac{U}{2} \\langle \\psi_+ | \\tau_z | \\psi_- \\rangle = \\frac{U}{2} \\langle \\psi_+ | \\psi_+ \\rangle = \\frac{U}{2} $$\n$$ W_{-+} = \\langle \\psi_- | H' | \\psi_+ \\rangle = \\frac{U}{2} \\langle \\psi_- | \\tau_z | \\psi_+ \\rangle = \\frac{U}{2} \\langle \\psi_- | \\psi_- \\rangle = \\frac{U}{2} $$\nThe perturbation matrix is:\n$$ W = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\frac{U}{2} \\\\ \\frac{U}{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe first-order energy corrections, $\\Delta E$, are the eigenvalues of $W$. We solve the characteristic equation:\n$$ \\det(W - \\lambda I) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda & \\frac{U}{2} \\\\ \\frac{U}{2} & -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda^2 - \\left(\\frac{U}{2}\\right)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions are $\\lambda = \\pm \\frac{U}{2}$.\n\nThe initially degenerate energy level $E_0$ splits into two levels:\n$$ E_1 = E_0 + \\frac{U}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E_2 = E_0 - \\frac{U}{2} $$\nThe band splitting, $\\Delta E(\\Gamma_m)$, is the energy difference between these two new levels. If $U$ can be positive or negative depending on which layer has a higher potential energy, the splitting is a non-negative quantity given by the absolute value of the energy difference.\n$$ \\Delta E(\\Gamma_m) = \\left| E_1 - E_2 \\right| = \\left| \\left(E_0 + \\frac{U}{2}\\right) - \\left(E_0 - \\frac{U}{2}\\right) \\right| = |U| $$\nBy convention, $U$ can be defined as the magnitude of the potential energy difference, in which case it is positive, and the splitting is simply $U$.

The problem defines this as:\n$$\n\\nu \\equiv n A_{\\mathrm{M}}\n$$\nwhere $A_{\\mathrm{M}}$ is the area of the moiré unit cell.\n\nSince the measurement is performed at a fixed chemical potential $\\mu$, we can differentiate this definition with respect to the magnetic field $B$ while holding $\\mu$ constant.

The task is to implement a self-consistent Hartree calculation for a simplified continuum model of a moiré superlattice and to compute the resulting electronic bandwidth and Hartree potential amplitude for a given set of parameters.\n\nThe problem is validated as follows:\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The model is based on fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism, employing standard methods like the Hartree approximation, plane-wave expansion, and self-consistent field theory. These are cornerstone techniques in computational condensed matter physics. The physical quantities, their relationships (e.g., the 2D Poisson equation in Fourier space), and the chosen parameters are all standard and realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is clearly defined with all necessary inputs, equations, and explicit computational procedures, including the iterative scheme (fixed-point mixing) and convergence criteria. This structure leads to a unique and meaningful numerical solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is described using precise, quantitative, and unbiased scientific language, free from any subjective elements.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it satisfies all criteria and exhibits no identifiable flaws. I will now proceed with a detailed solution.\n\n### Conceptual Outline\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve a set of coupled equations self-consistently. The electronic wavefunction depends on the total potential, which includes the externally applied moiré potential $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and the internal Hartree potential $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$. The Hartree potential, in turn, is generated by the charge density of the electrons, which is determined by the wavefunction itself.\n\n1.  **Wavefunction from Potential**: The Schrödinger equation, in a truncated plane-wave basis, becomes a matrix eigenvalue problem. The Hamiltonian matrix at a given crystal momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ depends on the Fourier components of the total potential, $V_{\\text{total}}(\\mathbf{Q}) = V_{\\mathrm{m}}(\\mathbf{Q}) + V_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathbf{Q})$. Diagonalizing this matrix yields the band energies and the corresponding Bloch state coefficients, $\\{c_{\\mathbf{G}}\\}$.\n2.  **Potential from Wavefunction**: The charge density is calculated from the lowest-energy Bloch state at the Brillouin zone center ($\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$, the $\\Gamma$ point), as per the problem's low-filling assumption. The Fourier components of this charge density, $\\delta n(\\mathbf{Q})$, are used to compute a new set of Hartree potential components, $V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\text{(calc)}}(\\mathbf{Q})$, via the 2D Poisson equation.\n3.  **Self-Consistency Loop**: Since $V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\text{(calc)}}$ will not, in general, be equal to the $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ used to construct the Hamiltonian, an iterative procedure is required. We start with an initial guess (e.g., $V_{\\mathrm{H}} = 0$). In each iteration, we use the current $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ to find the wavefunction, then use the wavefunction to calculate a new $V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{\\text{(calc)}}$. The next iteration's potential is a mix of the old and newly calculated potentials: $V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(\\text{new})} \\leftarrow \\alpha V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(\\text{calc})} + (1-\\alpha)V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(\\text{old})}$. This process is repeated until the change in $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ between iterations is negligibly small.\n\nOnce the self-consistent potential is found, it is used to calculate the final electronic band structure and the required output quantities.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1.  **Constants and Parameters**: All physical constants ($\\hbar$, $m_{\\mathrm{e}}$, $e$, $\\varepsilon_0$) are defined in SI units. Input parameters like moiré lattice constant $L_{\\mathrm{m}}$ (nm) and potential strength $V_0$ (meV) are converted to SI units (m and J, respectively) for calculations.\n\n2.  **Lattice and Basis Definition**: The primitive reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2$ are defined. The truncated plane-wave basis is formed by the set of $N_{\\mathrm{G}}=7$ vectors $\\{\\mathbf{G}\\} = \\{ \\mathbf{0}, \\pm \\mathbf{b}_1, \\pm \\mathbf{b}_2, \\pm(\\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2) \\}$. The set of $N_{\\mathbf{Q}}=6$ vectors over which the potential Fourier components are non-zero is $\\{\\mathbf{Q}\\} = \\{\\pm\\mathbf{b}_1, \\pm\\mathbf{b}_2, \\mp(\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2)\\}$.\n\n3.  **Self-Consistent Field (SCF) Loop**:\n    a. Initialize the Hartree potential array, $V_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathbf{Q})$, to zeros.\n    b. **Main Loop**: Iterate up to the maximum number of iterations.\n        i. Construct the $N_{\\mathrm{G}} \\times N_{\\mathrm{G}}$ Hamiltonian matrix $H_{\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{G}'}(\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0})$. Since the potential $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is real and even, the Fourier components $V(\\mathbf{Q})$ are real and even, making the Hamiltonian matrix real and symmetric.\n        $H_{\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{G}'} = \\delta_{\\mathbf{G},\\mathbf{G}'} \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{G}|^2}{2 m^\\ast} + V_{\\mathrm{m}}(\\mathbf{G}' - \\mathbf{G}) + V_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathbf{G}' - \\mathbf{G})$.\n        ii. Diagonalize the Hamiltonian using `numpy.linalg.eigh` to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvector corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue contains the coefficients $\\{c_{\\mathbf{G}}\\}$ for the ground state $\\psi_{\\Gamma}$.\n        iii. If the electron filling $N_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is zero, the Hartree potential is analytically zero. The loop can terminate, reporting convergence.\n        iv. Calculate the number-density Fourier components $n(\\mathbf{Q}) = \\frac{1}{A_{\\mathrm{m}}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{G}} c_{\\mathbf{G}} c_{\\mathbf{G}+\\mathbf{Q}}$. Since the coefficients $\\{c_{\\mathbf{G}}\\}$ are real, $n(\\mathbf{Q})$ will also be real.\n        v. Compute the new Hartree potential components $V_{\\mathrm{H}}^{(\\text{calc})}(\\mathbf{Q})$ using the formula $V_{\\mathrm{H}}(\\mathbf{Q}) = \\frac{e^2 N_{\\mathrm{e}}}{2 \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}} \\varepsilon_0 |\\mathbf{Q}|} n(\\mathbf{Q})$.\n        vi. Update the Hartree potential using the fixed-point mixing rule.\n        vii. Check for convergence by computing the Euclidean norm of the difference between the new and old $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ arrays. If the norm is below the tolerance $\\delta$, the loop terminates.\n\n4.  **Post-Processing**:\n    a. After convergence, the final $V_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is used to calculate the bandwidth $W$. This requires constructing and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian at the three high-symmetry points $\\Gamma (\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0})$, $M (\\mathbf{k}=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{b}_1)$, and $K (\\mathbf{k}=\\frac{1}{3}(\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2))$. The lowest eigenvalue at each point gives the energy $E_0(\\mathbf{k})$.\n    b. The bandwidth is $W = \\max\\{E_0\\} - \\min\\{E_0\\}$.\n    c. The root-mean-square amplitude of the converged Hartree potential, $V_{\\mathrm{H,rms}}$, is calculated over the $N_{\\mathbf{Q}}=6$ Fourier components.\n    d. The final result for each test case is the triple $[W, V_{\\mathrm{H,rms}}, N_{\\mathrm{it}}]$.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that all requirements of the problem are met with scientific and numerical rigor.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical Constants in SI units\nHBAR = 1.054571817e-34  # J*s\nM_E = 9.1093837015e-31  # kg\nE_CHARGE = 1.602176634e-19  # C\nEPS0 = 8.8541878128e-12  # F/m\nMEV_TO_J = 1.602176634e-22  # J/meV\nJ_TO_MEV = 1.0 / MEV_TO_J\n\ndef solve_case(params):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the self-consistent Hartree problem for one set of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    Lm_nm, V0_meV, m_star_factor, Ne, eps_r, alpha, delta_meV, max_iter = params\n\n    # 1.
