The problem specifies that the coupling is introduced via the principle of minimal coupling. For a particle with charge $q$, the canonical momentum operator $\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}$ (in the absence of a magnetic field, its eigenvalues are the crystal momentum $\\hbar \\mathbf{k}$) is replaced by the mechanical momentum operator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{p}} - q\\mathbf{A}$.

However, in a finite sample, quantum tunneling is possible. The evanescent modes are solutions of the Dirac equation that exist inside the bulk band gap and decay exponentially away from the contacts. Although they are not propagating states, they have a finite amplitude across the entire sample, allowing for a finite tunneling probability. The total conductivity is the sum of these tunneling contributions from all transverse modes. This tunneling mechanism is responsible for the non-zero minimal conductivity of clean graphene.\n\n- **Independence from $L$ and $W$**: The final result is a universal constant, independent of the sample's length $L$ and width $W$ (in the limit $W \\gg L$). The conductance $G = \\sigma_{xx} W/L$ is proportional to $W/L$. This geometric dependence arises from two competing effects: increasing the width $W$ increases the number of available transport channels, scaling conductance up proportionally to $W$. Conversely, increasing the length $L$ increases the tunneling distance, which suppresses the transmission of each evanescent mode, scaling conductance down as $1/L$. The combination gives $G \\propto W/L$.
