A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe foundation of this problem is the Ward-Takahashi identity for the U(1) gauge symmetry associated with charge conservation. This identity provides an exact relationship between the single-particle Green's function, $G$, and the fully dressed three-point vertex function, $\\Gamma^{\\mu}$. For an infinitesimal gauge transformation, the invariance of the theory leads to the following identity in momentum space:\n$$\nq_{\\mu} \\Gamma^{\\mu}(k; q) = G^{-1}(k+q) - G^{-1}(k)\n$$\nwhere we use the four-vector notation $k = (\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega)$ and $q = (\\mathbf{q}, i\\Omega)$. The quantity $q_{\\mu}\\Gamma^{\\mu}$ represents the contraction $q_0 \\Gamma^0 + \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\Gamma}$, but in Euclidean spacetime with imaginary frequency, it is $i\\Omega\\Gamma^0 - \\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\Gamma}$ (using metric signature $(+,+,+,+)$ after Wick rotation, and identifying $k_0 = i\\omega$). For our purposes, the four-vector dot product $q_{\\mu}k^{\\mu}$ is $q_0 k_0 - \\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{k}$ in Minkowski space, which becomes $-(i\\Omega)(i\\omega) - \\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{k} = \\Omega\\omega - \\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{k}$. A simpler notation without explicit metric is to write the identity as $q_{\\mu}\\Gamma^{\\mu}(k;q)$ and expand the RHS.\n\nThe problem requires the low-energy, long-wavelength (longitudinal) limit, where $q \\to 0$. In this limit, we can perform a Taylor expansion of the right-hand side:\n$$\nG^{-1}(k+q) - G^{-1}(k) = q_{\\nu} \\frac{\\partial G^{-1}(k)}{\\partial k_{\\nu}} + \\mathcal{O}(q^2)\n$$\nwhere the sum over $\\nu$ runs over all $d+1$ dimensions (frequency and momentum). Comparing the two expressions for the $q \\to 0$ limit, we find a direct relation for the longitudinal vertex:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{\\mu}(k; q \\to 0) = \\frac{\\partial G^{-1}(k)}{\\partial k_{\\mu}}\n$$\nThis is the low-energy Ward identity. We are interested in the temporal component, $\\Gamma^{0}$, which corresponds to the derivative with respect to the zeroth component of the four-momentum, $k_0 = i\\omega$.\n$$\n\\Gamma^{0}(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega; q \\to 0) = \\frac{\\partial G^{-1}(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega)}{\\partial (i\\omega)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the Dyson equation, $G^{-1}(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega) = i\\omega - \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\Sigma(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{0}(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega; q \\to 0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (i\\omega)} \\left( i\\omega - \\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\Sigma(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega) \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\partial \\Sigma(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega)}{\\partial (i\\omega)}\n$$\nThis expresses the temporal component of the vertex in the static, uniform limit in terms of the self-energy derivative. This identity is general and holds for any conserving approximation.\n\nThe role of the two-particle-irreducible kernel $\\mathcal{I}$ and vertex corrections is an important point. The Ward identity $q_{\\mu}\\Gamma^{\\mu} = G^{-1}(k+q) - G^{-1}(k)$ is an exact constraint on the *full* vertex $\\Gamma^{\\mu}$, which by definition includes all vertex corrections. These corrections are generated by the Bethe-Salpeter equation involving the kernel $\\mathcal{I}$. A \"conserving approximation\" (generated from a Luttinger-Ward functional) ensures that the approximate self-energy $\\Sigma$ and the corresponding approximate vertex $\\Gamma^{\\mu}$ (which includes corrections from the associated $\\mathcal{I}$) automatically satisfy the Ward identity. Therefore, the vertex corrections encoded in $\\mathcal{I}$ do not modify the Ward identity; they are themselves constrained by it. The relation $\\Gamma^{0}(k; q \\to 0) = 1 - \\partial\\Sigma(k)/\\partial(i\\omega)$ is thus valid for the full vertex within any such valid theoretical framework.\n\nNow, we proceed to compute the ratio $e^{\\star}/e$. The problem asks for the vertex at the Fermi surface, i.e., for $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{k}_{F}$ and $\\omega=0$.\n$$\n\\Gamma^{0}(\\mathbf{k}_{F}; q \\to 0) = \\left. \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\partial \\Sigma(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega)}{\\partial (i\\omega)} \\right) \\right|_{\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{k}_{F}, \\omega=0}\n$$\nLet us compare this to the definition of the quasiparticle residue $Z$ given in the problem:\n$$\nZ^{-1} = 1 - \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\Sigma(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega)}{\\partial (i\\omega)}\\right|_{\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{k}_{F},\\,\\omega=0}\n$$\nIt is immediately apparent that these two quantities are identical:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{0}(\\mathbf{k}_{F}; q \\to 0) = Z^{-1}\n$$\nThis is a general result of Fermi liquid theory, stemming directly from the Ward identity.\n\nThe renormalized quasiparticle charge $e^{\\star}$ is defined as $e^{\\star} = Z\\,\\Gamma^{0}(\\mathbf{k}_{F}; q\\to 0)\\,e$. We can now find the ratio $e^{\\star}/e$:\n$$\n\\frac{e^{\\star}}{e} = Z\\,\\Gamma^{0}(\\mathbf{k}_{F}; q \\to 0) = Z \\cdot Z^{-1} = 1\n$$\nThis fundamental result states that the quasiparticle charge is not renormalized by interactions, a direct consequence of charge conservation.\n\nTo make this result explicit using the specific form of the self-energy provided, $\\Sigma(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega) = \\alpha\\, i\\omega + \\beta\\,\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}}$, we compute the required quantities. The partial derivative of the self-energy with respect to $i\\omega$ at constant $\\mathbf{k}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Sigma(\\mathbf{k}, i\\omega)}{\\partial (i\\omega)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (i\\omega)} \\left( \\alpha\\, i\\omega + \\beta\\,\\xi_{\\mathbf{k}} \\right) = \\alpha\n$$\nThis result is a constant, so its value at the Fermi surface ($\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{k}_F, \\omega=0$) is also $\\alpha$.\n\nUsing this, we can compute $Z^{-1}$ and $\\Gamma^{0}(\\mathbf{k}_{F}; q \\to 0)$ explicitly in terms of $\\alpha$:\n$$\nZ^{-1} = 1 - \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\Sigma}{\\partial (i\\omega)}\\right|_{\\mathbf{k}_{F}, 0} = 1 - \\alpha\n$$\nFrom this, the quasiparticle residue is $Z = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}$.\n\nAnd for the vertex:\n$$\n\\Gamma^{0}(\\mathbf{k}_{F}; q \\to 0) = 1 - \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\Sigma}{\\partial (i\\omega)}\\right|_{\\mathbf{k}_{F}, 0} = 1 - \\alpha\n$$\nThe renormalization constant $\\beta$ does not appear in either expression as both involve a derivative with respect to frequency at constant momentum.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $e^{\\star}/e$ by substituting these explicit forms:\n$$\n\\frac{e^{\\star}}{e} = Z\\,\\Gamma^{0}(\\mathbf{k}_{F}; q \\to 0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}\\right) (1-\\alpha) = 1\n$$\nThis confirms the general result. The parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which renormalize the quasiparticle dispersion (and thus the effective mass), do not renormalize the electric charge due to the constraint imposed by the U(1) Ward identity.

Single-Particle Relaxation Time ($\\tau$)**\nThe single-particle lifetime $\\tau$ is determined by the imaginary part of the electron self-energy $\\Sigma$ in the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA). The scattering rate $1/\\tau$ is the total transition rate out of a given state, which is found by integrating the differential scattering probability $W(\\theta)$ over all possible scattering angles $\\theta$.\n\nFor a state on the Fermi surface, the total scattering rate is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} W(\\theta)\n$$\nThe normalization factor of $1/(2\\pi)$ corresponds to averaging over the angular phase space in two dimensions.

In the conserving ladder approximation, which is the diagrammatic equivalent of solving the linearized Boltzmann equation, the scattering rate is weighted by a factor of $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$. This factor accounts for the fact that forward scattering (small $\\theta$) is inefficient at relaxing the net current, while backscattering (large $\\theta$) is most effective.\n\nThe transport scattering rate is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} W(\\theta) (1 - \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $W(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} W_0 \\left[ 1 + \\alpha \\cos\\theta + \\beta \\cos(2\\theta) \\right] (1 - \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nWe expand the integrand:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = W_0 \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} \\left[ 1 - \\cos\\theta + \\alpha\\cos\\theta - \\alpha\\cos^2\\theta + \\beta\\cos(2\\theta) - \\beta\\cos(2\\theta)\\cos\\theta \\right]\n$$\nLet's evaluate the integral of each term:\n- $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} (1) = 1$\n- $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} (-\\cos\\theta) = 0$\n- $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} (\\alpha\\cos\\theta) = 0$\n- $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} (-\\alpha\\cos^2\\theta) = -\\alpha \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2} = -\\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$\n- $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} (\\beta\\cos(2\\theta)) = 0$\n- To evaluate the last term, we use the identity $\\cos(A)\\cos(B) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(A-B)+\\cos(A+B)]$:\n  $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} (-\\beta\\cos(2\\theta)\\cos\\theta) = -\\frac{\\beta}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{2\\pi} [\\cos\\theta + \\cos(3\\theta)] = 0$\n\nSumming the contributions, we obtain the transport scattering rate:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}} = W_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right)\n$$\nThe transport relaxation time is therefore:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{1}{W_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right)}\n$$\n\nThe parameter $\\beta$, being the coefficient of an even-parity harmonic $\\cos(2\\theta)$, does not couple to the odd-parity transport factor $(1-\\cos\\theta)$ after angular integration, and thus does not affect the DC transport lifetime.\n\n**2.3. The Ratio R**\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R = \\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}} / \\tau$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}}{\\tau} = \\frac{1/\\left[ W_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\right]}{1/W_0}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{W_0}{W_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\n$$\nThis result is derived from the standard definitions of $\\tau$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}$, which are justified by the SCBA and ladder approximations specified in the problem. The ladder summation for the conductivity (current-current correlation function) is precisely what generates the collision integral of the linearized Boltzmann equation, from which the definition of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ arises. The Ward identity ensures that the use of the SCBA self-energy and the ladder vertex forms a conserving approximation, making this calculation scheme consistent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2}}}$$", "id": "3023934"}]}
