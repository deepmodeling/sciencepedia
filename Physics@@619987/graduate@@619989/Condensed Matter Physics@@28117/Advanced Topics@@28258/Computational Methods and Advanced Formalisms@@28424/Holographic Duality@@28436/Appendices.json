In the $z$ coordinate, since $1-z = r_+^2/r^2$, this corresponds to a behavior of $R(z) \\sim (1-z)^{\\Delta/2}$ near $z=1$. The mass-dimension relation in AdS$_3$ is $m^2 = \\Delta(\\Delta-2)$.\n\nBased on this analysis, we seek a solution of the form:\n$$\nR(z) = z^{-i\\omega/(2r_+)} (1-z)^{\\Delta/2} F(z)\n$$\nwhere $F(z)$ is a regular function at $z=0$ and $z=1$. Substituting this ansatz into the radial ODE reveals that $F(z)$ must satisfy the hypergeometric equation:\n$$\nz(1-z)F''(z) + [c - (a+b+1)z]F'(z) - abF(z) = 0\n$$\nThe parameters $a, b, c$ are found to be:\n$$\na = \\frac{\\Delta}{2} - \\frac{i(\\omega-k)}{2r_{+}}\n$$\n$$\nb = \\frac{\\Delta}{2} - \\frac{i(\\omega+k)}{2r_{+}}\n$$\n$$\nc = 1 - \\frac{i\\omega}{r_{+}}\n$$\nThe general solution to the hypergeometric equation is a linear combination of two independent solutions. One regular solution at $z=0$ is the hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)$. Our choice of the prefactor $z^{-i\\omega/(2r_+)}$ has already enforced the ingoing boundary condition at the horizon ($z=0$).\n\nNow, we must enforce the boundary condition at the AdS boundary ($z=1$). The asymptotic behavior of ${}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)$ as $z \\to 1$ is given by the standard connection formula:\n$$\n{}_2F_1(a,b;c;z) = \\frac{\\Gamma(c)\\Gamma(c-a-b)}{\\Gamma(c-a)\\Gamma(c-b)}{}_2F_1(a,b;a+b-c+1;1-z) \\\\\n+ (1-z)^{c-a-b}\\frac{\\Gamma(c)\\Gamma(a+b-c)}{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}{}_2F_1(c-a,c-b;c-a-b+1;1-z)\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $R(z)$, the near-boundary behavior is a superposition of two terms. The first term behaves as $(1-z)^{\\Delta/2}$. The second term's behavior is determined by the exponent $\\frac{\\Delta}{2} + c-a-b$. Let's calculate this exponent:\n$$\nc-a-b = \\left(1 - \\frac{i\\omega}{r_{+}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2} - \\frac{i(\\omega-k)}{2r_{+}}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2} - \\frac{i(\\omega+k)}{2r_{+}}\\right) = 1 - \\Delta\n$$\nSo, the second term in the asymptotic expansion of $R(z)$ behaves as $(1-z)^{\\Delta/2 + 1 - \\Delta} = (1-z)^{1-\\Delta/2}$. This corresponds to the non-normalizable mode $r^{\\Delta-2}$.\nThe boundary condition requires that the coefficient of this non-normalizable part vanishes. This coefficient is proportional to $\\frac{\\Gamma(a+b-c)}{\\Gamma(a)\\Gamma(b)}$. For this coefficient to be zero, one of the Gamma functions in the denominator, $\\Gamma(a)$ or $\\Gamma(b)$, must have a pole. The Gamma function $\\Gamma(x)$ has simple poles for all non-positive integers $x \\in \\{0, -1, -2, \\dots\\}$.\nThis leads to a quantization condition for the QNM frequencies:\n$$\na = -n \\quad \\text{or} \\quad b = -n \\quad \\text{for } n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}\n$$\nThis condition yields two families of QNM frequencies.\n\nCase 1: $a = -n$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta}{2} - \\frac{i(\\omega-k)}{2r_{+}} = -n \\implies i(\\omega-k) = 2r_+\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+n\\right) = r_+(\\Delta+2n)\n$$\n$$\n\\omega-k = -i r_+(\\Delta+2n) \\implies \\omega_n(k) = k - i r_+(\\Delta+2n)\n$$\n\nCase 2: $b = -n$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta}{2} - \\frac{i(\\omega+k)}{2r_{+}} = -n \\implies i(\\omega+k) = 2r_+\\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}+n\\right) = r_+(\\Delta+2n)\n$$\n$$\n\\omega+k = -i r_+(\\Delta+2n) \\implies \\omega_n(k) = -k - i r_+(\\Delta+2n)\n$$\nThe imaginary part of $\\omega$ is negative, which corresponds to modes that decay in time as $e^{-i\\omega t} = e^{-i\\text{Re}(\\omega)t}e^{\\text{Im}(\\omega)t}$. These are the physically correct quasinormal modes.\n\nCombining these two families and using the given relation for the Hawking temperature $T = \\frac{r_{+}}{2\\pi}$, we can write the full QNM spectrum. The imaginary part gives the damping rate of the mode, $\\gamma_n = |\\text{Im}(\\omega_n)| = r_+(\\Delta+2n) = 2\\pi T (\\Delta+2n)$. The spacing in damping rates between successive overtones is $\\gamma_{n+1}-\\gamma_n=2r_+=4\\pi T$.\n\nThe final expression for the QNM frequencies is thus:\n$$\n\\omega_n(k) = \\pm k - i (2\\pi T) (\\Delta+2n), \\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} k - i(2\\pi T)(\\Delta + 2n) & -k - i(2\\pi T)(\\Delta + 2n) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2994594"}]}
