Second, we will compute the additivity defect $\\Delta$ for the provided Local Density Approximation (LDA) and Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) functionals.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Exchange-Correlation Functional Additivity**\n\nThe total electronic energy in Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) is given by the functional:\n$$E[n] = T_{s}[n] + J[n] + E_{ext}[n] + E_{xc}[n]$$\nwhere $T_s[n]$ is the kinetic energy of a non-interacting reference system, $J[n]$ is the classical Coulomb (Hartree) energy of the electron density, $E_{ext}[n]$ is the energy from the external potential (typically from atomic nuclei), and $E_{xc}[n]$ is the exchange-correlation energy, which contains all the many-body quantum effects.\n\nThe problem states that for two non-interacting, infinitely separated fragments A and B with densities $n_A(\\mathbf{r})$ and $n_B(\\mathbf{r})$, the total energy is size-consistent. This means the energy of the combined system (with density $n = n_A+n_B$) is the sum of the energies of the individual fragments:\n$$E[n_A+n_B] = E[n_A] + E[n_B]$$\n\nLet's examine the additivity of each component of the total energy functional for these non-interacting, infinitely separated fragments with disjoint density supports $\\Omega_A$ and $\\Omega_B$.\n\n1.  **Kinetic Energy $T_s[n]$**: Since the fragments are non-interacting, the set of Kohn-Sham orbitals for the combined system is simply the union of the orbitals for fragments A and B. The total non-interacting kinetic energy is therefore the sum of the individual kinetic energies:\n    $$T_s[n_A+n_B] = T_s[n_A] + T_s[n_B]$$\n\n2.  **External Potential Energy $E_{ext}[n]$**: The external potential for the combined system is $v_{ext}(\\mathbf{r}) = v_A(\\mathbf{r}) + v_B(\\mathbf{r})$, where $v_A$ and $v_B$ are the potentials local to each fragment.\n    $$E_{ext}[n_A+n_B] = \\int (v_A(\\mathbf{r})+v_B(\\mathbf{r})) (n_A(\\mathbf{r})+n_B(\\mathbf{r})) d^{3}r$$\n    Expanding this gives $\\int v_A n_A d^{3}r + \\int v_B n_B d^{3}r + \\int v_A n_B d^{3}r + \\int v_B n_A d^{3}r$. The first two terms are $E_{ext}[n_A]$ and $E_{ext}[n_B]$. The term $\\int v_A n_B d^{3}r$ represents the electrostatic interaction between the nuclei of fragment A and the electrons of fragment B. Since the fragments are infinitely separated, this interaction energy is zero. Similarly, $\\int v_B n_A d^{3}r = 0$. Thus:\n    $$E_{ext}[n_A+n_B] = E_{ext}[n_A] + E_{ext}[n_B]$$\n\n3.  **Hartree Energy $J[n]$**: The Hartree energy is given by $J[n] = \\frac{1}{2} \\iint \\frac{n(\\mathbf{r})n(\\mathbf{r'})}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}|} d^{3}r d^{3}r'$. For the combined system:\n    $$J[n_A+n_B] = \\frac{1}{2} \\iint \\frac{(n_A(\\mathbf{r})+n_B(\\mathbf{r}))(n_A(\\mathbf{r'})+n_B(\\mathbf{r'}))}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}|} d^{3}r d^{3}r'$$\n    $$= J[n_A] + J[n_B] + \\iint \\frac{n_A(\\mathbf{r})n_B(\\mathbf{r'})}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}|} d^{3}r d^{3}r'$$\n    The last term is the Coulomb interaction between the electron clouds of the two fragments. As they are infinitely separated, this term is also zero. So:\n    $$J[n_A+n_B] = J[n_A] + J[n_B]$$\n\nNow, we substitute these results into the size-consistency equation for the total energy:\n$$E[n_A+n_B] = T_s[n_A+n_B] + E_{ext}[n_A+n_B] + J[n_A+n_B] + E_{xc}[n_A+n_B]$$\n$$E[n_A] + E[n_B] = (T_s[n_A] + E_{ext}[n_A] + J[n_A] + E_{xc}[n_A]) + (T_s[n_B] + E_{ext}[n_B] + J[n_B] + E_{xc}[n_B])$$\nUsing the additivity of $T_s$, $E_{ext}$, and $J$, we can equate the two expressions and cancel terms:\n$$(T_s[n_A]+T_s[n_B]) + (E_{ext}[n_A]+E_{ext}[n_B]) + (J[n_A]+J[n_B]) + E_{xc}[n_A+n_B] = (T_s[n_A]+T_s[n_B]) + (E_{ext}[n_A]+E_{ext}[n_B]) + (J[n_A]+J[n_B]) + E_{xc}[n_A] + E_{xc}[n_B]$$\nThis simplifies to the required additivity condition for the exchange-correlation functional:\n$$E_{xc}[n_A+n_B] = E_{xc}[n_A] + E_{xc}[n_B]$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Additivity Defect $\\Delta$**\n\nWe are asked to compute the additivity defect $\\Delta = E_{xc}[n_A+n_B] - E_{xc}[n_A] - E_{xc}[n_B]$ for two specific functionals. Let $n(\\mathbf{r}) = n_A(\\mathbf{r}) + n_B(\\mathbf{r})$. The densities $n_A$ and $n_B$ have disjoint supports $\\Omega_A$ and $\\Omega_B$, respectively. This means for any point $\\mathbf{r}$:\n- If $\\mathbf{r} \\in \\Omega_A$, then $n_B(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$ and $n(\\mathbf{r}) = n_A(\\mathbf{r})$.\n- If $\\mathbf{r} \\in \\Omega_B$, then $n_A(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$ and $n(\\mathbf{r}) = n_B(\\mathbf{r})$.\n- If $\\mathbf{r} \\notin \\Omega_A \\cup \\Omega_B$, then $n_A(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$, $n_B(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$, and $n(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$.\n\nThe problem also states a crucial smoothness condition: $\\nabla n_A(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{0}$ wherever $n_A(\\mathbf{r})=0$, and similarly for $n_B$. This implies that the gradient of one fragment's density is zero over the support of the other fragment.\n\n**A) Local Density Approximation (LDA)**\nThe functional is $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} C n(\\mathbf{r})^{4/3} d^3r$.\nLet's compute $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_A+n_B]$:\n$$E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_A+n_B] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} C (n_A(\\mathbf{r})+n_B(\\mathbf{r}))^{4/3} d^3r$$\nWe can split the integral over the disjoint regions $\\Omega_A$, $\\Omega_B$, and the rest of space $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus (\\Omega_A \\cup \\Omega_B)$:\n$$E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_A+n_B] = \\int_{\\Omega_A} C (n_A(\\mathbf{r}))^{4/3} d^3r + \\int_{\\Omega_B} C (n_B(\\mathbf{r}))^{4/3} d^3r + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus (\\Omega_A \\cup \\Omega_B)} C (0)^{4/3} d^3r$$\nThe third integral is zero. The first integral is exactly $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_A]$, since $n_A$ is zero outside $\\Omega_A$. The second integral is $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_B]$.\nTherefore, $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_A+n_B] = E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_A] + E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_B]$.\nThe additivity defect for LDA is:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{LDA}} = E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_A+n_B] - E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_A] - E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}[n_B] = 0$$\n\n**B) Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)**\nThe functional is $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\left[C n(\\mathbf{r})^{4/3} + \\mu \\frac{|\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})|^2}{n(\\mathbf{r})^{4/3}}\\right] d^3r$.\nLet $e_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(n, \\nabla n)$ be the integrand. Let's compute $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_A+n_B]$:\n$$E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_A+n_B] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} e_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(n_A+n_B, \\nabla n_A + \\nabla n_B) d^3r$$\nAgain, we split the integral:\n- Over $\\Omega_A$: $n_B(\\mathbf{r})=0$ and $\\nabla n_B(\\mathbf{r})=\\mathbf{0}$. The integrand becomes $e_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(n_A, \\nabla n_A)$.\n- Over $\\Omega_B$: $n_A(\\mathbf{r})=0$ and $\\nabla n_A(\\mathbf{r})=\\mathbf{0}$. The integrand becomes $e_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(n_B, \\nabla n_B)$.\n- Over $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus (\\Omega_A \\cup \\Omega_B)$: $n_A=n_B=0$ and $\\nabla n_A=\\nabla n_B=\\mathbf{0}$. The integrand is $e_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(0, \\mathbf{0})$, which is $0$.\nSo, the integral becomes:\n$$E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_A+n_B] = \\int_{\\Omega_A} e_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(n_A, \\nabla n_A) d^3r + \\int_{\\Omega_B} e_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}(n_B, \\nabla n_B) d^3r$$\nThe first term is exactly $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_A]$ (since the integrand is zero outside $\\Omega_A$) and the second term is $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_B]$.\nThus, $E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_A+n_B] = E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_A] + E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_B]$.\nThe additivity defect for this GGA functional is:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{GGA}} = E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_A+n_B] - E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_A] - E_{xc}^{\\mathrm{GGA}}[n_B] = 0$$\n\nFor both the LDA and GGA functionals provided, the additivity defect is exactly $0$. This is a general feature of semilocal functionals due to their dependence on the density (and its derivatives) at a single point in space.\n\nThe final answer consists of the additivity defect for the LDA functional and the GGA functional, respectively.\n$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{LDA}} = 0$\n$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{GGA}} = 0$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pmatrix{0 & 0}}\n$$", "id": "2987518"}]}
