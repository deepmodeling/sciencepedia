We will address each part sequentially.\n\n(1) Finding the optimal variational parameter $g$ in the noninteracting limit.\n\nThe variational energy for a given variational state $|\\Psi\\rangle$ and Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ is given by the Rayleigh-Ritz principle:\n$$\nE[\\Psi] = \\frac{\\langle \\Psi | \\hat{H} | \\Psi \\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi | \\Psi \\rangle} \\ge E_{GS}\n$$\nwhere $E_{GS}$ is the true ground state energy of $\\hat{H}$. The equality holds if and only if $|\\Psi\\rangle$ is the true ground state. Our task is to find the parameter $g$ that minimizes this energy for the variational family of states $|\\Psi_{G}(g)\\rangle$ when the interaction term $U=0$.\n\nIn the noninteracting limit, $U=0$, the Hubbard Hamiltonian reduces to the tight-binding Hamiltonian:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{0} = -t \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle, \\sigma} \\left( \\hat{c}^{\\dagger}_{i \\sigma} \\hat{c}_{j \\sigma} + \\hat{c}^{\\dagger}_{j \\sigma} \\hat{c}_{i \\sigma} \\right)\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian is quadratic in the fermion creation and annihilation operators. Such Hamiltonians can be diagonalized exactly by a Fourier transform to momentum space, resulting in:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{0} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, \\sigma} \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} \\hat{c}^{\\dagger}_{\\mathbf{k} \\sigma} \\hat{c}_{\\mathbf{k} \\sigma}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the single-particle dispersion. The ground state of this noninteracting Hamiltonian, by construction, is the state where all single-particle energy levels $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$ are filled up to the Fermi energy, and all levels above are empty. This state is precisely the filled Fermi sea, denoted as $|\\mathrm{FS}\\rangle$. Therefore, $|\\mathrm{FS}\\rangle$ is the exact ground state of $\\hat{H}_{0}$.\n\nThe Gutzwiller variational wavefunction is defined as $|\\Psi_{G}(g) \\rangle = \\hat{P}_{G}(g) | \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle$, where the Gutzwiller projector is:\n$$\n\\hat{P}_{G}(g) = \\prod_{i} \\left[ 1 - (1-g) \\, \\hat{n}_{i \\uparrow} \\hat{n}_{i \\downarrow} \\right]\n$$\nThe variational parameter $g$ is in the range $[0, 1]$. We need to find the value of $g$ that minimizes the variational energy $E(g) = E[|\\Psi_G(g)\\rangle]$ for the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$.\n\nAccording to the Rayleigh-Ritz principle, the minimum possible value of $E(g)$ is the true ground state energy $E_{GS}$, which is achieved if the variational state $|\\Psi_G(g)\\rangle$ becomes the true ground state $|\\mathrm{FS}\\rangle$. Let's examine the Gutzwiller projector for a special value of $g$. When $g=1$, the projector becomes:\n$$\n\\hat{P}_{G}(g=1) = \\prod_{i} \\left[ 1 - (1-1) \\, \\hat{n}_{i \\uparrow} \\hat{n}_{i \\downarrow} \\right] = \\prod_{i} [1] = \\hat{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{I}$ is the identity operator.\nFor $g=1$, the Gutzwiller wavefunction is:\n$$\n|\\Psi_{G}(g=1) \\rangle = \\hat{P}_{G}(g=1) | \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle = \\hat{I} | \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle = | \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle\n$$\nThis means that for $g=1$, the variational state is identical to the exact ground state of the noninteracting Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{0}$.\nConsequently, the variational energy at $g=1$ is:\n$$\nE(g=1) = \\frac{\\langle \\mathrm{FS} | \\hat{H}_{0} | \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle}{\\langle \\mathrm{FS} | \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle} = E_{GS}\n$$\nSince the variational energy is always greater than or equal to the true ground state energy, $E(g) \\ge E_{GS}$ for all $g \\in [0,1]$, the minimum of $E(g)$ must be at $g=1$.\nThus, the value of $g$ that minimizes the variational energy in the noninteracting limit is $g=1$, and the corresponding ground state is the Fermi sea $| \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle$.\n\n(2) Derivation of the noninteracting kinetic energy per site $E_{0}(n)$.\n\nIn the noninteracting limit ($U=0$), the ground state is $|\\mathrm{FS}\\rangle$. The ground state energy per site is the expectation value of the kinetic Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{0}$ in this state, divided by the number of lattice sites $N_s$.\n$$\nE_{0}(n) = \\frac{1}{N_s} \\langle \\mathrm{FS} | \\hat{H}_{0} | \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the diagonal form of $\\hat{H}_{0}$:\n$$\nE_{0}(n) = \\frac{1}{N_s} \\left\\langle \\mathrm{FS} \\left| \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, \\sigma} \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} \\hat{c}^{\\dagger}_{\\mathbf{k} \\sigma} \\hat{c}_{\\mathbf{k} \\sigma} \\right| \\mathrm{FS} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{N_s} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, \\sigma} \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} \\langle \\mathrm{FS} | \\hat{n}_{\\mathbf{k} \\sigma} | \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle\n$$\nThe expectation value of the number operator $\\hat{n}_{\\mathbf{k} \\sigma}$ in the filled Fermi sea state is $1$ if the state $(\\mathbf{k}, \\sigma)$ is occupied (i.e., $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} < \\mu(n)$) and $0$ if it is unoccupied (i.e., $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} > \\mu(n)$), where $\\mu(n)$ is the chemical potential (Fermi energy at zero temperature) corresponding to filling $n$.\n$$\n\\langle \\mathrm{FS} | \\hat{n}_{\\mathbf{k} \\sigma} | \\mathrm{FS} \\rangle = \\theta(\\mu(n) - \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}})\n$$\nwhere $\\theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. So the energy is:\n$$\nE_{0}(n) = \\frac{1}{N_s} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, \\sigma, \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} < \\mu(n)} \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}\n$$\nIn the thermodynamic limit ($N_s \\to \\infty$), the sum over momentum states $\\mathbf{k}$ can be converted into an integral over energy $\\epsilon$ using the density of states (DOS) $\\rho_{0}(\\epsilon)$. The transformation is $\\frac{1}{N_s} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\to \\int d\\epsilon \\, \\rho_0(\\epsilon)$. The given DOS $\\rho_0(\\epsilon)$ is normalized per site and per spin.\nSumming over the two spin species ($\\sigma = \\uparrow, \\downarrow$) gives a factor of $2$:\n$$\nE_{0}(n) = 2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\epsilon \\, \\rho_{0}(\\epsilon) \\, \\epsilon \\, \\theta(\\mu(n) - \\epsilon)\n$$\nThis simplifies to an integral up to the chemical potential $\\mu(n)$:\n$$\nE_{0}(n) = 2 \\int_{-zt}^{\\mu(n)} d\\epsilon \\, \\epsilon \\, \\rho_{0}(\\epsilon)\n$$\nwhere $-zt$ is the bottom of the band. The chemical potential $\\mu(n)$ is itself determined by the filling $n$. The number of electrons per site is given by:\n$$\nn = 2 \\int_{-zt}^{\\mu(n)} d\\epsilon \\, \\rho_{0}(\\epsilon)\n$$\nThis equation implicitly defines $\\mu(n)$ as a function of $n$.\n\n(3) Explicit calculation for the 1D chain at half-filling.\n\nWe now specialize to the one-dimensional case ($d=1$, $z=2$) at half-filling ($n=1$). The single-particle dispersion is $\\epsilon_k = -2t \\cos(k)$ for $k \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$ (with lattice constant $a=1$). The band edges are at $\\pm 2t$.\n\nFirst, we find the noninteracting density of states $\\rho_{0}(\\epsilon)$ for the 1D chain. This is given per spin and per site by:\n$$\n\\rho_{0}(\\epsilon) = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\frac{dk}{2\\pi} \\delta(\\epsilon - \\epsilon_k) = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\frac{dk}{2\\pi} \\delta(\\epsilon + 2t \\cos k)\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we find the roots of the argument of the delta function, $k_0$, and divide by the absolute value of the derivative of the argument.\nThe roots are $k = \\pm \\arccos(-\\epsilon/(2t))$. The derivative is $\\frac{d}{dk}(\\epsilon + 2t \\cos k) = -2t \\sin k$.\nFor $\\epsilon \\in (-2t, 2t)$, there are two roots in $[-\\pi, \\pi]$. Due to symmetry, we can consider $k \\in [0, \\pi]$ and multiply by $2$.\n$$\n\\rho_{0}(\\epsilon) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{|-2t \\sin(\\arccos(-\\epsilon/2t))|} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{1}{2t \\sqrt{1 - (-\\epsilon/2t)^2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{0}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\sqrt{4t^2 - \\epsilon^2}} \\quad \\text{for } \\epsilon \\in (-2t, 2t), \\text{ and } 0 \\text{ otherwise.}\n$$\nNext, we determine the chemical potential $\\mu$ for half-filling, $n=1$. Using the relation from part (2):\n$$\n1 = 2 \\int_{-2t}^{\\mu} \\rho_{0}(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = 2 \\int_{-2t}^{\\mu} \\frac{d\\epsilon}{\\pi \\sqrt{4t^2 - \\epsilon^2}}\n$$\nThe integral is $\\int \\frac{d\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{a^2-\\epsilon^2}} = \\arcsin(\\epsilon/a)$. So:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left[ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{2t}\\right) \\right]_{-2t}^{\\mu} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left( \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2t}\\right) - \\arcsin(-1) \\right) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left( \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2t}\\right) + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2t}\\right) + \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\implies \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2t}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis gives $\\mu=0$. This is expected, as the band is symmetric around $\\epsilon=0$, so half-filling corresponds to filling up to the midpoint.\n\nFinally, we compute the kinetic energy per site, $E_0$, using the formula from part (2) with $\\mu=0$:\n$$\nE_0 = 2 \\int_{-2t}^{0} \\epsilon \\, \\rho_{0}(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = 2 \\int_{-2t}^{0} \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\pi \\sqrt{4t^2 - \\epsilon^2}} d\\epsilon\n$$\nWe perform a substitution. Let $u = 4t^2 - \\epsilon^2$. Then $du = -2\\epsilon d\\epsilon$, so $\\epsilon d\\epsilon = -du/2$.\nThe limits of integration change: when $\\epsilon = -2t$, $u = 4t^2 - (-2t)^2 = 0$. When $\\epsilon=0$, $u = 4t^2 - 0^2 = 4t^2$.\n$$\nE_0 = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{4t^2} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u}} \\left(-\\frac{du}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{4t^2} u^{-1/2} du\n$$\n$$\nE_0 = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ 2u^{1/2} \\right]_{0}^{4t^2} = -\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left( \\sqrt{4t^2} - \\sqrt{0} \\right) = -\\frac{2}{\\pi} (2t)\n$$\n$$\nE_0 = -\\frac{4t}{\\pi}\n$$\nThis is the ground state kinetic energy per site for the noninteracting 1D tight-binding chain at half-filling.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-\\frac{4t}{\\pi}} $$", "id": "2993301"}, {"introduction": "We now turn to the heart of the Gutzwiller approximation's success: its ability to describe the physics of strong electron correlation.

Do not approximate or round.", "solution": "The solution is developed in four parts, as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of local probabilities\n\nWe are given a homogeneous paramagnetic state at half-filling. This implies the total density per site is $n=1$, and the spin-resolved densities are $n_{\\uparrow}=n_{\\downarrow}=1/2$. Let the probabilities of finding a site in the empty state ($|0\\rangle$), spin-up state ($|\\uparrow\\rangle$), spin-down state ($|\\downarrow\\rangle$), or doubly-occupied state ($|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle$) be $p_{0}$, $p_{\\uparrow}$, $p_{\\downarrow}$, and $p_{2}$, respectively. The double-occupancy probability is defined as $d$, so $p_{2}=d$.\n\nThese probabilities must satisfy several conditions based on the given physical constraints:\n\n1.  Normalization: The sum of probabilities for all possible local configurations must be unity.\n    $$p_{0} + p_{\\uparrow} + p_{\\downarrow} + p_{2} = 1$$\n2.  Total electron density: The average number of electrons per site is given by $n = \\langle \\hat{n}_{i\\uparrow} + \\hat{n}_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle$. In terms of local probabilities, this is $n = (0)p_{0} + (1)p_{\\uparrow} + (1)p_{\\downarrow} + (2)p_{2}$. With $n=1$ and $p_{2}=d$, this becomes:\n    $$p_{\\uparrow} + p_{\\downarrow} + 2d = 1$$\n    This implies $p_{\\uparrow} + p_{\\downarrow} = 1 - 2d$.\n3.  Spin-resolved densities: The average number of spin-$\\sigma$ electrons per site is $n_{\\sigma} = \\langle \\hat{n}_{i\\sigma} \\rangle$.\n    For spin-up electrons, $n_{\\uparrow} = p_{\\uparrow} + p_{2}$. Given $n_{\\uparrow}=1/2$ and $p_{2}=d$, we have:\n    $$\\frac{1}{2} = p_{\\uparrow} + d \\implies p_{\\uparrow} = \\frac{1}{2} - d$$\n    For spin-down electrons, $n_{\\downarrow} = p_{\\downarrow} + p_{2}$. Given $n_{\\downarrow}=1/2$ and $p_{2}=d$, we have:\n    $$\\frac{1}{2} = p_{\\downarrow} + d \\implies p_{\\downarrow} = \\frac{1}{2} - d$$\n    The result $p_{\\uparrow}=p_{\\downarrow}$ is consistent with the assumed paramagnetic state.\n\n4.  Probability of empty site: We can now find $p_{0}$ using the normalization condition:\n    $$p_{0} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - d\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - d\\right) + d = 1$$\n    $$p_{0} + 1 - 2d + d = 1$$\n    $$p_{0} - d = 0 \\implies p_{0} = d$$\n\nThus, at half-filling, the local probabilities are indeed $p_{2}=d$, $p_{0}=d$, and $p_{\\uparrow}=p_{\\downarrow}=\\frac{1}{2}-d$. The probabilities must be non-negative, which imposes the constraint $d \\in [0, 1/4]$. Note that in the non-interacting case, $d=(n/2)^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n\nPart 2: Kinetic energy renormalization and variational energy\n\nThe Gutzwiller approximation provides a way to estimate the expectation value of the kinetic energy term by considering the statistical weight of local configurations that permit electron hopping. The expectation value of the hopping operator is renormalized with respect to its value in the non-interacting state $|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\hat{c}_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{j\\sigma}\\rangle_{G} = q_{\\sigma}(d)\\,\\langle \\hat{c}_{i\\sigma}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{j\\sigma}\\rangle_{0} $$\nThe renormalization factor $q_{\\sigma}(d)$ is derived by considering the reduction in hopping amplitude due to the correlation effects introduced by the Gutzwiller projector. Within the standard Gutzwiller approximation, this factor is given by the formula:\n$$ q_{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{p_{0}p_{\\sigma}} + \\sqrt{p_{-\\sigma}p_{2}}\\right)^2}{n_{\\sigma}(1-n_{\\sigma})} $$\nThis formula sums the amplitudes for the two possible hopping processes for a spin-$\\sigma$ electron: from a singly-occupied site to an empty site, and from a doubly-occupied site to a singly-occupied site with spin $-\\sigma$. The denominator normalizes this by the probability of having a configuration that allows hopping in the non-interacting system.\n\nFor the paramagnetic state at half-filling, we have $n_{\\uparrow}=n_{\\downarrow}=1/2$, so the denominator is $n_{\\sigma}(1-n_{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{2}(1-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4}$. The spin-indifference of the probabilities ($p_{\\uparrow}=p_{\\downarrow}$) means $q_{\\uparrow}=q_{\\downarrow}=q$. Using the results from Part 1 ($p_{0}=d, p_{2}=d, p_{\\sigma}=p_{-\\sigma}=\\frac{1}{2}-d$):\n$$ q(d) = \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-d\\right)} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-d\\right)d}\\right)^2}{1/4} = \\frac{\\left(2\\sqrt{d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-d\\right)}\\right)^2}{1/4} $$\n$$ q(d) = \\frac{4d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-d\\right)}{1/4} = 16d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-d\\right) = 8d(1-2d) $$\nThe total variational energy per site, $E(d)$, is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy expectation values. The kinetic energy per site is the non-interacting kinetic energy $\\varepsilon_{0}$ multiplied by the renormalization factor $q(d)$. The potential energy per site is $U$ times the probability of double occupancy, $d$.\n$$ E(d) = q(d)\\varepsilon_{0} + Ud = 8d(1-2d)\\varepsilon_{0} + Ud $$\n\nPart 3: Minimization of energy and critical interaction\n\nTo find the optimal double occupancy $d^{\\star}$, we minimize $E(d)$ with respect to $d$ for $d\\in[0, 1/4]$. First, we find the stationary point by setting the first derivative to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial d} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d} \\left( (8d-16d^2)\\varepsilon_{0} + Ud \\right) = (8-32d)\\varepsilon_{0} + U $$\nSetting $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial d}=0$ yields:\n$$ (8-32d^{\\star})\\varepsilon_{0} + U = 0 $$\n$$ 32d^{\\star}\\varepsilon_{0} = 8\\varepsilon_{0} + U \\implies d^{\\star}(U) = \\frac{8\\varepsilon_{0}+U}{32\\varepsilon_{0}} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{U}{32\\varepsilon_{0}} $$\nSince the kinetic energy of the Fermi sea is negative ($\\varepsilon_{0}<0$), we can write this as $d^{\\star}(U) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{U}{32|\\varepsilon_{0}|}$.\nThis solution is physically valid as long as $d^{\\star} \\geq 0$. This condition defines the critical interaction strength $U_{c}$:\n$$ d^{\\star}(U_{c}) = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{U_{c}}{32\\varepsilon_{0}} = 0 \\implies U_{c} = -8\\varepsilon_{0} $$\nFor $U \\ge U_{c}$, the derivative $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial d}$ becomes non-negative over the entire domain $d\\in[0, 1/4]$, meaning the energy is minimized at the boundary $d^{\\star}=0$. The stationary point is thus $d^{\\star}(U)$ for $U<U_{c}$.\n\nPart 4: Second derivative and stability analysis\n\nWe compute the second derivative of the energy $E(d)$ with respect to $d$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}E}{\\partial d^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial d} \\left( (8-32d)\\varepsilon_{0} + U \\right) = -32\\varepsilon_{0} $$\nThis result is a constant, independent of $d$. It is therefore the value of the curvature at the minimum $d^{\\star}(U)$ for all $U < U_{c}$.\n\nTo discuss stability, we note that $\\varepsilon_{0}<0$, which implies $\\frac{\\partial^{2}E}{\\partial d^{2}} = -32\\varepsilon_{0} = 32|\\varepsilon_{0}| > 0$. A positive second derivative indicates that the stationary point $d^{\\star}(U)$ is a true minimum of the energy functional. This confirms that for $U<U_{c}$, the Gutzwiller metallic state is a stable variational solution.\n\nThe nature of the transition at $U_{c}$ can be analyzed by observing the behavior of the optimal double occupancy, $d^{\\star}(U) = \\frac{1}{4}(1 - U/U_c)$. As $U$ approaches $U_{c}$ from below, $d^{\\star}(U)$ continuously goes to zero. For $U \\ge U_{c}$, the minimum is pinned at $d^{\\star}=0$. Since the order parameter (here, embodied by $d$) changes continuously to zero at the critical point, the transition is continuous, characteristic of a second-order phase transition. The smooth evolution of the minimum of the energy landscape $E(d)$ towards the boundary $d=0$ precludes a discontinuous jump, which would be the signature of a first-order transition. This continuous metal-insulator transition is known as the Brinkman-Rice transition.\n\nThe final answer requested is the simplified expression for the second derivative evaluated at the minimum.\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\partial^{2}E}{\\partial d^{2}}\\right|_{d=d^{\\star}} = -32\\varepsilon_{0} $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-32\\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$", "id": "2993304"}, {"introduction": "Having established the existence of a Mott insulator at half-filling, we now investigate the system's response to doping.

The system is in a paramagnetic state with electron filling $n = 1 - \\delta$, where $\\delta$ represents the hole doping. The quasiparticle weight $Z$ is the factor by which the kinetic energy of the non-interacting system is renormalized due to correlations.\n\nThe Gutzwiller variational energy per site for the paramagnetic state is given by\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{G}} = Z(n, d) \\varepsilon_0 + U d $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_0$ is the kinetic energy per site in the uncorrelated ground state $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$, and $d = \\langle n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow} \\rangle_{\\mathrm{G}}$ is the probability of double occupancy in the correlated state $|\\Psi_{\\mathrm{G}}\\rangle$, which serves as the variational parameter. The kinetic energy renormalization factor $Z(n,d)$, which is the quasiparticle weight, is a central result of the Gutzwiller approximation. For a paramagnetic state with spin-up density $n_{\\uparrow} = n/2$ and spin-down density $n_{\\downarrow} = n/2$, this factor is given by the well-established formula:\n$$ Z(n,d) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{n}{2}(1-\\frac{n}{2})} \\left[ \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n}{2} - d\\right)(1-n+d)} + \\sqrt{d\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-d\\right)} \\right]^2 $$\nThis formula relates the reduction in kinetic energy to the probabilities of local electronic configurations in the correlated state, which are themselves functions of the total density $n$ and the double occupancy $d$. Specifically, within the GA, the site probabilities are: empty ($p_0=1-n+d$), singly occupied ($p_s=n-2d$), and doubly occupied ($p_2=d$).\n\nThe problem requires us to work in the limit $U \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the potential energy term $U d$ would diverge for any non-zero double occupancy $d>0$. To minimize the total energy $E_{\\mathrm{G}}$, the system must completely suppress double occupations. Therefore, the variational parameter must take the value $d=0$.\n\nWe substitute $d=0$ into the general expression for $Z(n,d)$:\n$$ Z(n) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{n}{2}(1-\\frac{n}{2})} \\left[ \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n}{2} - 0\\right)(1-n+0)} + \\sqrt{0 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n}{2}-0\\right)} \\right]^2 $$\nThe second term in the bracket vanishes:\n$$ Z(n) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{n}{2}(1-\\frac{n}{2})} \\left[ \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}(1-n)} \\right]^2 $$\nSquaring the term in the bracket yields:\n$$ Z(n) = \\frac{\\frac{n}{2}(1-n)}{\\frac{n}{2}(1-\\frac{n}{2})} $$\nThe factor of $n/2$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, provided $n \\neq 0$:\n$$ Z(n) = \\frac{1-n}{1-\\frac{n}{2}} $$\nThis is the expression for the quasiparticle weight as a function of the electron filling $n$ in the $U \\to \\infty$ limit.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be expressed in terms of the hole doping $\\delta$. The filling is given as $n = 1 - \\delta$. We substitute this into our expression for $Z(n)$:\n$$ Z(\\delta) = \\frac{1-(1-\\delta)}{1-\\frac{1-\\delta}{2}} $$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$ Z(\\delta) = \\frac{\\delta}{1-\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\delta}{2}} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\delta}{2}} $$\nFinally, we simplify the denominator:\n$$ Z(\\delta) = \\frac{\\delta}{\\frac{1+\\delta}{2}} = \\frac{2\\delta}{1+\\delta} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the quasiparticle weight as a function of hole doping $\\delta$.\n\nFor the explanatory part, the Brinkman–Rice Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a phenomenon that occurs precisely at half-filling ($n=1$, or $\\delta=0$) in the Hubbard model. Within the Gutzwiller approximation, this transition is characterized by the vanishing of the quasiparticle weight, $Z \\to 0$, at a critical interaction strength $U_c$. A state with $Z=0$ is an insulator, as the effective mass of quasiparticles, $m^* \\propto 1/Z$, diverges, indicating complete localization of electrons.\n\nIn the $U \\to \\infty$ limit we are considering, the interaction strength is well above any finite critical value $U_c$. Let's examine our result at and away from half-filling.\nAt half-filling, $\\delta=0$, our derived expression gives:\n$$ Z(\\delta=0) = \\frac{2 \\cdot 0}{1+0} = 0 $$\nThe quasiparticle weight is zero, which means the system is a Mott insulator. This is consistent with the Brinkman-Rice picture, where for $U>U_c$ the half-filled system becomes an insulator.\n\nHowever, for any finite hole doping, $0 < \\delta < 1$, the expression $Z(\\delta) = \\frac{2\\delta}{1+\\delta}$ is strictly positive. Since $\\delta > 0$, the numerator $2\\delta$ is positive, and the denominator $1+\\delta$ is also positive. Thus, $Z(\\delta) > 0$.\n\nA non-zero quasiparticle weight ($Z>0$) signifies that the system is a correlated metal, not an insulator. The electronic quasiparticles have a finite effective mass and can propagate through the lattice, supporting metallic conductivity. The value of $Z$ being less than $1$ for $\\delta < 1$ indicates that the electronic bands are narrowed and the effective mass is enhanced by correlations, but the system remains metallic.\n\nTherefore, the sharp Mott transition, which is strictly a half-filling phenomenon, disappears as soon as the system is doped away from $n=1$. The insulating state with $Z=0$ is fragile and exists only at the singular point $\\delta=0$. Any finite doping introduces mobile charge carriers (holes), which restore kinetic energy pathways that were blocked at half-filling. In the half-filled insulator, an electron cannot hop because doing so would create a high-energy doubly occupied site. Doping introduces empty sites, allowing electrons to hop without incurring the large energy penalty $U$, thus restoring metallic behavior. The Gutzwiller approximation correctly captures this physics, showing an immediate transition from $Z=0$ to $Z>0$ upon infinitesimal doping.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\delta}{1+\\delta}}\n$$", "id": "2993298"}]}
