It is a standard, fundamental exercise in Density Functional Theory concerning the consequences of a constant shift in the external potential.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Ground-State Energy Shift\n\nThe analysis begins with the definition of the two Hamiltonians, $\\hat{H}[v]$ and $\\hat{H}[v']$, which correspond to the external potentials $v(\\mathbf{r})$ and $v'(\\mathbf{r})$, respectively. The relationship between the two potentials is given as $v'(\\mathbf{r}) = v(\\mathbf{r}) + C$, where $C$ is a constant.\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the shifted potential, $\\hat{H}[v']$, can be expressed in terms of the original Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}[v]$.\n$$\n\\hat{H}[v'] = \\hat{T} + \\hat{W} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} v'(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{i})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v'(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}[v'] = \\hat{T} + \\hat{W} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(v(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{i}) + C\\right)\n$$\nBy distributing the summation, we can separate the terms:\n$$\n\\hat{H}[v'] = \\left(\\hat{T} + \\hat{W} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} v(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{i})\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} C\n$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is the original Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}[v]$. The second term is a sum of a constant over the $N$ electrons.\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} C = NC\n$$\nThis term is a scalar operator, equivalent to $NC\\hat{I}$, where $\\hat{I}$ is the identity operator. Thus, the relationship between the two Hamiltonians is:\n$$\n\\hat{H}[v'] = \\hat{H}[v] + NC\n$$\nThe ground-state energy for the shifted potential, $E_0[v']$, is defined by the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle:\n$$\nE_{0}[v'] = \\inf_{\\substack{\\Psi \\in \\mathcal{H}_{N} \\\\ \\|\\Psi\\|=1}} \\langle \\Psi | \\hat{H}[v'] | \\Psi \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\hat{H}[v']$:\n$$\nE_{0}[v'] = \\inf_{\\substack{\\Psi \\in \\mathcal{H}_{N} \\\\ \\|\\Psi\\|=1}} \\langle \\Psi | \\left( \\hat{H}[v] + NC \\right) | \\Psi \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the inner product, we can split the expectation value:\n$$\nE_{0}[v'] = \\inf_{\\substack{\\Psi \\in \\mathcal{H}_{N} \\\\ \\|\\Psi\\|=1}} \\left( \\langle \\Psi | \\hat{H}[v] | \\Psi \\rangle + \\langle \\Psi | NC | \\Psi \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nSince $NC$ is a scalar, it can be factored out of the inner product:\n$$\n\\langle \\Psi | NC | \\Psi \\rangle = NC \\langle \\Psi | \\Psi \\rangle\n$$\nThe minimization is over all normalized wavefunctions, for which $\\langle \\Psi | \\Psi \\rangle = 1$.

If $C$ is in Hartrees, then $NC$ is also in Hartrees.\n\n### Part 2: Proof of Common Ground-State Density\n\nWe need to show that there exists a ground-state wavefunction of $\\hat{H}[v']$ that yields the same ground-state density as a ground-state wavefunction of $\\hat{H}[v]$. Let $\\Psi_{0}$ be a ground-state wavefunction of $\\hat{H}[v]$. By definition, it is an eigenfunction of $\\hat{H}[v]$ with the lowest possible eigenvalue, $E_{0}[v]$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}[v] |\\Psi_{0}\\rangle = E_{0}[v] |\\Psi_{0}\\rangle\n$$\nLet us now apply the new Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}[v']$, to this same wavefunction $\\Psi_{0}$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}[v'] |\\Psi_{0}\\rangle = (\\hat{H}[v] + NC) |\\Psi_{0}\\rangle\n$$\nUsing the distributive property of operators and the eigenvalue equation for $\\hat{H}[v]$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}[v'] |\\Psi_{0}\\rangle = \\hat{H}[v]|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle + NC|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle = E_{0}[v]|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle + NC|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{H}[v'] |\\Psi_{0}\\rangle = (E_{0}[v] + NC)|\\Psi_{0}\\rangle\n$$\nFrom the result in Part 1, we know that $E_{0}[v'] = E_{0}[v] + NC$. Substituting this into the equation above gives:\n$$\n\\hat{H}[v'] |\\Psi_{0}\\rangle = E_{0}[v'] |\\Psi_{0}\\rangle\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that $\\Psi_{0}$ is an eigenfunction of $\\hat{H}[v']$ with eigenvalue $E_{0}[v']$. Since $E_{0}[v']$ is the ground-state energy of the system with potential $v'(\\mathbf{r})$, $\\Psi_{0}$ is a ground-state wavefunction for $\\hat{H}[v']$.\n\nThis holds regardless of degeneracy:\n- **Nondegenerate Case:** If the ground state of $\\hat{H}[v]$ is nondegenerate, its wavefunction $\\Psi_{0}$ is unique (up to a phase factor). We have shown that this same wavefunction $\\Psi_{0}$ is also the ground-state wavefunction of $\\hat{H}[v']$. Since the ground-state wavefunctions are identical, the corresponding ground-state densities, $n_{\\Psi_{0}}(\\mathbf{r})$, must also be identical.\n- **Degenerate Case:** If the ground state of $\\hat{H}[v]$ is degenerate, the ground state is a subspace $\\mathcal{E}_{0}[v]$ of the Hilbert space. Any wavefunction $\\Psi_{0} \\in \\mathcal{E}_{0}[v]$ is a ground-state wavefunction. Our proof shows that any such $\\Psi_{0}$ is also an eigenfunction of $\\hat{H}[v']$ with the ground-state eigenvalue $E_{0}[v']$. This means that the ground-state subspace of $\\hat{H}[v']$, $\\mathcal{E}_{0}[v']$, is identical to the ground-state subspace of $\\hat{H}[v]$: $\\mathcal{E}_{0}[v'] = \\mathcal{E}_{0}[v]$. Consequently, for any ground-state wavefunction of $\\hat{H}[v]$, it is also a ground-state wavefunction of $\\hat{H}[v']$, and thus they share the same set of possible ground-state densities.\n\nIn both cases, we have proven that a ground-state wavefunction of $\\hat{H}[v']$ exists (in fact, all of them) that is identical to a ground-state wavefunction of $\\hat{H}[v]$, and therefore produces the same ground-state density.\n\n### Part 3: Implication for the First Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem\n\nThe First Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem establishes a fundamental mapping in DFT. It states that the ground-state electron density $n(\\mathbf{r})$ of a system of interacting electrons uniquely determines the external potential $v(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nThe results from Parts 1 and 2 reveal a crucial subtlety in this theorem. We have demonstrated that two different external potentials, $v(\\mathbf{r})$ and $v'(\\mathbf{r}) = v(\\mathbf{r}) + C$ (for any $C \\ne 0$), can give rise to the exact same set of ground-state wavefunctions. As a direct consequence, they share the same ground-state density or set of ground-state densities.\n\nThis constitutes a direct counterexample to a simplistic interpretation of the first HK theorem that the mapping from density $n(\\mathbf{r})$ to potential $v(\\mathbf{r})$ is strictly one-to-one. We have two distinct potentials, $v(\\mathbf{r})$ and $v'(\\mathbf{r})$, that map to the same ground-state density $n(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nTherefore, the precise implication of this result is that the First Hohenberg-Kohn theorem must be qualified: **The ground-state density $n(\\mathbf{r})$ determines the external potential $v(\\mathbf{r})$ uniquely only up to an arbitrary additive constant.** The standard proof of the first HK theorem by *reductio ad absurdum* implicitly relies on the assumption that the two potentials being compared do not differ by a constant, as this is the exact case where the proof's central contradiction fails to materialize. The mapping is one-to-one between a ground-state density and an equivalence class of potentials $\\{v(\\mathbf{r}) + C | C \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{NC}\n$$", "id": "2994356"}, {"introduction": "The correspondence between density and potential guaranteed by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem is not merely an abstract statement; it implies that one can, in principle, perform a \"density-to-potential\" inversion.

Since $T_s[n]$ and $E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n]$ are defined to be the kinetic and external potential energies of the non-interacting KS system that reproduces the density $n$, for this one-electron system they are identical to the true kinetic and potential energies. Therefore, for the DFT energy to equal the exact energy, we must have $E_{\\mathrm{H}}[n] + E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n] = 0$. The exchange-correlation energy is composed of the exchange energy $E_{x}[n]$ and the correlation energy $E_{c}[n]$. The exact exchange energy for a single occupied orbital $\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})$ is given by $E_{x}[n] = -\\frac{1}{2}\\iint \\frac{|\\varphi(\\mathbf{r}_1)|^2|\\varphi(\\mathbf{r}_2)|^2}{|\\mathbf{r}_1-\\mathbf{r}_2|}d^3r_1 d^3r_2$. Given that $n(\\mathbf{r})=|\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})|^2$, this becomes $E_{x}[n] = -E_{\\mathrm{H}}[n]$. This demonstrates that the exchange energy exactly cancels the spurious self-interaction contained in the Hartree energy. Consequently, for the total sum to be zero, the correlation energy $E_{c}[n]$ must be zero. This is consistent with the definition of correlation energy as the difference between the exact energy and the Hartree-Fock energy, which for a one-electron system are identical.\n\nWith $E_{\\mathrm{H}}[n] + E_{x}[n] + E_{c}[n] = 0$, the total energy simplifies to $E[n] = T_s[n] + E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n]$. We now evaluate these two terms.\nThe single normalized KS orbital $\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})$ that reproduces the density $n(r) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\exp(-2r)$ is $\\varphi(r) = \\sqrt{n(r)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp(-r)$, as the ground state orbital can be chosen to be real and positive.\nThe external potential energy is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n] = \\int v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) n(\\mathbf{r}) d^3r = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\exp(-2r)\\right) 4\\pi r^2 dr$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n] = -4 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} r\\exp(-2r) dr = -4 \\left(\\frac{1!}{2^2}\\right) = -4 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -1 \\text{ Hartree}$$\nThe Kohn-Sham kinetic energy is $T_s[n] = \\int \\varphi^*(\\mathbf{r})(-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2)\\varphi(\\mathbf{r}) d^3r$. Using integration by parts (Green's first identity), this is equivalent to:\n$$T_s[n] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int |\\nabla \\varphi(\\mathbf{r})|^2 d^3r$$\nFor our radial orbital, $\\nabla\\varphi(r) = \\frac{d\\varphi}{dr}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp(-r)\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\varphi(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.\nThus, $|\\nabla \\varphi(r)|^2 = (\\nabla\\varphi) \\cdot (\\nabla\\varphi) = (-\\varphi\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) \\cdot (-\\varphi\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) = \\varphi(r)^2 = n(r)$.\n$$T_s[n] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int n(r) d^3r$$\nSince the density is normalized to one electron, $\\int n(r) d^3r = 1$.\n$$T_s[n] = \\frac{1}{2}(1) = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ Hartree}$$\n\nFinally, we combine the components to obtain the total ground-state energy:\n$$E[n] = T_s[n] + E_{\\mathrm{ext}}[n] = \\frac{1}{2} + (-1) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\text{ Hartree}$$\nThis result matches the known exact energy of the hydrogen atom, as expected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2634155"}]}
