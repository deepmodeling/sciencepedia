Thus, $n_{\\sigma_d} = 3$.\n\nThe characters of the polar vector representation, $\\chi_{\\text{vec}}(g)$, are given in the problem. We can now compute the characters of the mechanical representation, $\\chi_{\\text{mech}}(g)$.\n\n| Class $[g]$   | Size | $n_g$ | $\\chi_{\\text{vec}}(g)$ | $\\chi_{\\text{mech}}(g) = n_g \\times \\chi_{\\text{vec}}(g)$ |\n|---------------|------|-------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| $[E]$         | $1$  | $3$   | $3$                   | $3 \\times 3 = 9$                                        |\n| $[2C_{3}]$    | $2$  | $3$   | $0$                   | $3 \\times 0 = 0$                                        |\n| $[3C_{2}']$    | $3$  | $1$   | $-1$                  | $1 \\times (-1) = -1$                                    |\n| $[i]$         | $1$  | $1$   | $-3$                  | $1 \\times (-3) = -3$                                    |\n| $[2S_{6}]$    | $2$  | $1$   | $0$                   | $1 \\times 0 = 0$                                        |\n| $[3\\sigma_{d}]$ | $3$  | $3$   | $1$                   | $3 \\times 1 = 3$                                        |\n\nThe character vector for $\\Gamma_{\\text{mech}}$ is $(\\chi_{\\text{mech}}(E), \\chi_{\\text{mech}}(C_3), \\dots) = (9, 0, -1, -3, 0, 3)$.\n\nSecond, we decompose $\\Gamma_{\\text{mech}}$ into the irreducible representations (irreps) of $D_{3d}$ using the reduction formula. The number of times an irrep $\\Gamma_j$ appears in $\\Gamma_{\\text{mech}}$ is given by:\n$$a_j = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{k} N_k \\chi_{\\text{mech}}(g_k) \\chi_j(g_k)$$\nwhere $|G|=12$ is the order of the group, $N_k$ is the size of class $k$, and $\\chi_j$ are the characters of the irreps from the provided table.\n\n- $a_{A_{1g}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ (1)(9)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(-1)(1) + (1)(-3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(3)(1) \\right] = \\frac{1}{12} (9 - 3 - 3 + 9) = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$.\n- $a_{A_{2g}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ (1)(9)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(-1)(-1) + (1)(-3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(3)(-1) \\right] = \\frac{1}{12} (9 + 3 - 3 - 9) = \\frac{0}{12} = 0$.\n- $a_{E_{g}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ (1)(9)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(-1)(0) + (1)(-3)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(3)(0) \\right] = \\frac{1}{12} (18 - 6) = \\frac{12}{12} = 1$.\n- $a_{A_{1u}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ (1)(9)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(-1)(1) + (1)(-3)(-1) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(3)(-1) \\right] = \\frac{1}{12} (9 - 3 + 3 - 9) = \\frac{0}{12} = 0$.\n- $a_{A_{2u}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ (1)(9)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(-1)(-1) + (1)(-3)(-1) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(3)(1) \\right] = \\frac{1}{12} (9 + 3 + 3 + 9) = \\frac{24}{12} = 2$.\n- $a_{E_{u}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ (1)(9)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(-1)(0) + (1)(-3)(-2) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(3)(0) \\right] = \\frac{1}{12} (18 + 6) = \\frac{24}{12} = 2$.\n\nThus, the decomposition of the mechanical representation is:\n$$\\Gamma_{\\text{mech}} = A_{1g} \\oplus E_g \\oplus 2A_{2u} \\oplus 2E_u$$\nThe total dimension is $1 + 2 + 2(1) + 2(2) = 9$, which correctly matches $3N=9$.\n\nThird, we identify the acoustic and optical modes. The acoustic modes correspond to uniform translations of the entire crystal, which transform as a polar vector. The problem states that for $D_{3d}$, the three translational degrees of freedom transform as $A_{2u}$ (for translation along $z$) and $E_u$ (for translations in the $xy$-plane).\n$$\\Gamma_{\\text{acoustic}} = A_{2u} \\oplus E_u$$\nThe optical modes are the remaining modes in the mechanical representation.\n$$\\Gamma_{\\text{optical}} = \\Gamma_{\\text{mech}} - \\Gamma_{\\text{acoustic}} = (A_{1g} \\oplus E_g \\oplus 2A_{2u} \\oplus 2E_u) - (A_{2u} \\oplus E_u) = A_{1g} \\oplus E_g \\oplus A_{2u} \\oplus E_u$$\nThe crystal is centrosymmetric, so the rule of mutual exclusion applies. Modes with even parity ($g$, *gerade*) are Raman active, while modes with odd parity ($u$, *ungerade*) are infrared (IR) active.\n- Raman active modes: $\\Gamma_{\\text{Raman}} = A_{1g} \\oplus E_g$.\n- Infrared active modes: $\\Gamma_{\\text{IR}} = A_{2u} \\oplus E_u$.\nThere are no silent optical modes in this system.\n\nThe question asks for the symbolic decomposition of the $3N$-dimensional mechanical representation, which is the result of the second step.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{A_{1g} \\oplus E_g \\oplus 2A_{2u} \\oplus 2E_u}\n$$", "id": "3013364"}]}
