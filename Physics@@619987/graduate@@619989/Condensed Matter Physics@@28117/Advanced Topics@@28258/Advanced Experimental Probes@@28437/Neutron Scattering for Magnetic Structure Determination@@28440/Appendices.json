To find the average intensity, we must average the polarization factor $\\sin^2(\\alpha)$ over all possible orientations of $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$ relative to a fixed $\\mathbf{Q}$. This is equivalent to averaging over the surface of a unit sphere. We set up the average in spherical coordinates, where $\\alpha$ corresponds to the polar angle $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{powder}} = \\langle \\sin^2(\\alpha) \\rangle = \\frac{\\int_{\\text{sphere}} \\sin^2(\\theta) \\,d\\Omega}{\\int_{\\text{sphere}} \\,d\\Omega}\n$$\nThe differential solid angle is $d\\Omega = \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta d\\phi$.

Since $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{powder}} = 2/3$ is a constant, independent of the reflection $\\mathbf{Q}$ and the moment direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$, the ratio of intensities for the two reflections $\\mathbf{G}_1$ and $\\mathbf{G}_2$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\frac{j(\\mathbf{G}_1) |F_{\\mathrm{mag}}(\\mathbf{G}_1)|^2 (2/3)}{j(\\mathbf{G}_2) |F_{\\mathrm{mag}}(\\mathbf{G}_2)|^2 (2/3)} = \\frac{j(\\mathbf{G}_1)}{j(\\mathbf{G}_2)}\n$$\nThis ratio depends only on the crystallographic multiplicities, as $|F_{\\mathrm{mag}}|$ was given to be the same. If we consider two different magnetic structures that differ only by the absolute direction of the ordered moment (e.g., $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{a}}$ vs. $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{c}}$), their calculated powder diffraction patterns will be identical. The powder averaging process makes the measurement insensitive to the absolute moment direction.\n**Implication:** It is impossible to determine the absolute orientation of the magnetic moment vector relative to the crystallographic axes from unpolarized powder neutron diffraction data alone.\n\n3. **Auxiliary Strategies to Resolve Ambiguity**\n\nTo break the degeneracy introduced by powder averaging, one must use a technique that is sensitive to the relative orientation of the moments and the crystal lattice.\n\n*   **Strategy 1: Single Crystal Neutron Diffraction.**\n    *   **Justification:** In a single crystal experiment, the crystal is held in a fixed orientation. For each measured Bragg reflection $\\mathbf{Q}$, the angle $\\alpha$ between $\\mathbf{Q}$ and the moment direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$ is well-defined. The intensity is proportional to $\\sin^2(\\alpha)$. By measuring the intensities of reflections with different orientations (different $\\mathbf{Q}$ vectors), one can distinguish between models for $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$. For instance, if $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}} \\parallel \\hat{\\mathbf{c}}$, all magnetic reflections of the type $(0, 0, l)$ will have $\\mathbf{Q}$ parallel to $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$, making $\\alpha=0$ and the intensity zero. Observing such systematic extinctions provides direct proof of the moment direction.\n\n*   **Strategy 2: Application of an External Magnetic Field.**\n    *   **Justification:** Applying a magnetic field to the powder sample breaks the random orientation of magnetic domains due to magnetic anisotropy. The magnetic moments in each crystallite will preferentially align relative to the field direction. This creates a textured distribution of moment directions $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$ in the laboratory frame. The powder average is no longer isotropic. By comparing the intensity of a magnetic reflection measured with $\\mathbf{Q}$ parallel versus perpendicular to the applied field, one introduces an orientation dependence that can be used to determine the intrinsic magnetic easy axis and thus the zero-field direction of $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$$", "id": "3007075"}, {"introduction": "Symmetry analysis is one of the most powerful tools in crystallography and the study of ordered matter, and in magnetism this extends to magnetic space groups which include time-reversal symmetry.
