The derivation will be based on the provided definitions and principles of quantum state counting in solid-state physics.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the total number of electrons, $N_e$, and the Fermi wavevector, $k_F$. The system is a one-dimensional chain of length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. This quantizes the allowed crystal momentum values, $k$. The spacing between consecutive allowed $k$-values is $\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$. In the thermodynamic limit, where $L$ is large, we can treat the density of states in $k$-space as continuous. The number of available orbital states per unit length of $k$-space is $\\frac{1}{\\Delta k} = \\frac{L}{2\\pi}$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, at zero temperature, the ground state is formed by filling all single-particle states with crystal momentum $k$ in the range $[-k_F, k_F]$. The total length of this filled interval in $k$-space is $k_F - (-k_F) = 2k_F$.\n\nThe total number of occupied orbital states (or $k$-states) is the length of the filled interval multiplied by the density of states in $k$-space:\n$$ \\text{Number of occupied } k\\text{-states} = (2k_F) \\times \\left(\\frac{L}{2\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{k_F L}{\\pi} $$\nThe electrons are specified as spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ fermions. By the Pauli exclusion principle, each orbital $k$-state can accommodate two electrons: one with spin-up and one with spin-down. Therefore, the total number of electrons, $N_e$, is twice the number of occupied $k$-states:\n$$ N_e = 2 \\times \\frac{k_F L}{\\pi} = \\frac{2k_F L}{\\pi} $$\nNext, we use the definition of the electron filling, $n$, which is given as the average number of electrons per lattice site, $N$.\n$$ n = \\frac{N_e}{N} $$\nFrom this definition, we can express the total number of electrons as $N_e = nN$.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $N_e$, we can solve for $2k_F$:\n$$ \\frac{2k_F L}{\\pi} = nN $$\nSolving for $2k_F$ yields:\n$$ 2k_F = \\frac{nN\\pi}{L} $$\nThe problem provides the lattice constant $a$ as the ratio of the total length $L$ to the number of sites $N$, i.e., $a = \\frac{L}{N}$. The reciprocal of this relation is $\\frac{N}{L} = \\frac{1}{a}$. Substituting this into the expression for $2k_F$, we obtain the first desired result in terms of $n$ and $a$:\n$$ 2k_F = n\\pi \\left(\\frac{N}{L}\\right) = \\frac{n\\pi}{a} $$\nNow, we proceed to find the periodicity $\\lambda$ of the Peierls distortion.

A lattice distortion with wavevector $Q=2k_F$ creates a periodic potential that couples electron states with momentum $k$ and $k-Q$. For an electron near the right Fermi point ($k \\approx k_F$), the state $k-Q$ is near the left Fermi point ($k-2k_F \\approx -k_F$).\n\nLet's describe the system using a basis of right-moving ($R$) and left-moving ($L$) electrons. For a given momentum $p$ relative to the Fermi points, a right-mover has momentum $k_F+p$ and energy $\\xi_p = v_F p$, while a left-mover has momentum $-k_F+p$ and energy $-\\xi_p = -v_F p$. The mean-field Hamiltonian that couples these states via the order parameter $\\Delta(T)$ can be written in a $2 \\times 2$ matrix form for each momentum $p$ and spin $\\sigma$. Taking $\\Delta$ to be real and positive:\n$$\nH_p = \\begin{pmatrix} \\xi_p & \\Delta \\\\ \\Delta & -\\xi_p \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian acts on the two-component spinor $(c_{R,p,\\sigma}, c_{L,p,\\sigma})^T$. The eigenvalues of $H_p$ are found by solving the characteristic equation:\n$$\n(\\xi_p - E)(-\\xi_p - E) - \\Delta^2 = 0 \\implies E^2 - \\xi_p^2 - \\Delta^2 = 0\n$$\nThis yields the gapped single-particle excitation spectrum $E_p = \\pm \\sqrt{\\xi_p^2 + \\Delta^2}$.\n\nThe order parameter $\\Delta$ is proportional to the expectation value of the particle-hole condensate, which represents the amplitude of the charge density wave. The self-consistency condition is established by relating $\\Delta$ to the gap it creates. A standard approach is to minimize the total free energy of the system with respect to $\\Delta$. The free energy has an electronic part $F_{el}$ and a lattice (or phononic) part $F_{ph}$. The lattice part, representing the elastic energy cost of the distortion, is proportional to $\\Delta^2$, i.e., $F_{ph} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{g_{eff}}$ for some effective coupling $g_{eff}$. The electronic free energy for the gapped system is $F_{el} = -2T \\sum_{p, \\sigma} \\ln(1+\\exp(-E_{p,\\alpha}/T))$, summing over all quasiparticle states $\\alpha$. The total free energy relative to the non-distorted state is:\n$$\nF(\\Delta) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{g_{eff}} - 2T \\sum_{p, \\sigma} \\left[ \\ln(1+e^{-E_p/T}) + \\ln(1+e^{E_p/T}) \\right] + \\text{const.}\n$$\nWhere the sum is over one half of the states (e.g., $p>0$) and all spins. Minimizing the free energy, $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial\\Delta} = 0$, leads to the gap equation.\nA more direct method is to use the self-consistency definition of the order parameter, which, with an appropriate choice of coupling constant $g$, is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta = g \\sum_{p,\\sigma} \\langle c_{L,p,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{R,p,\\sigma} \\rangle\n$$\nThe expectation value can be calculated by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian $H_p$. The transformation to the diagonal basis of quasiparticle operators $(\\gamma_{p,+}, \\gamma_{p,-})^T$ shows that $\\langle c_{L,p,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{R,p,\\sigma} \\rangle = u_p v_p (n_F(E_p) - n_F(-E_p))$, where $u_p^2, v_p^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(1 \\pm \\xi_p/E_p)$ are the coherence factors and $n_F(E)$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution. This simplifies to:\n$$\n\\langle c_{L,p,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{R,p,\\sigma} \\rangle = -\\frac{\\Delta}{2E_p} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{E_p}{2T}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming a definition of $g$ that absorbs the negative sign, the self-consistency equation becomes:\n$$\n1 = g \\sum_{p,\\sigma} \\frac{1}{2E_p} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{E_p}{2T}\\right)\n$$\nThe sum over momenta $p$ is converted to an integral over energy $\\xi=v_F p$.

The problem states we can assume a constant DOS, $N(0)$, within a cutoff energy $\\omega_D$ around the Fermi level. The precise prefactors in the final gap equation depend on whether $N(0)$ refers to one or both branches of the electronic spectrum.
