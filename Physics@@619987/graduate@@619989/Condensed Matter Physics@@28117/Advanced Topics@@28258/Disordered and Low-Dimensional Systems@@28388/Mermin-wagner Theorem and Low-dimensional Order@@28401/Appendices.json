The problem is a standard, non-trivial calculation central to the topic of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and does not suffer from any of the listed invalidity flaws. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 2: Fourier Decomposition of the Energy Functional**\n\nTo analyze the thermal fluctuations, we decompose the phase field $\\theta(\\mathbf{r})$ into its Fourier modes. For a system of size $L \\times L$ with periodic boundary conditions, the field can be expressed as a Fourier series:\n$$\n\\theta(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} e^{i \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nwhere the wavevectors $\\mathbf{q}$ are quantized as $\\mathbf{q} = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}(n_x, n_y)$ for integers $n_x, n_y$. Since $\\theta(\\mathbf{r})$ is a real field, its Fourier coefficients must satisfy the condition $\\hat{\\theta}_{-\\mathbf{q}} = \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}^{*}$.\n\nThe gradient of the phase field is:\n$$\n\\nabla\\theta(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} i\\mathbf{q} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} e^{i \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nThe squared magnitude of the gradient is $|\\nabla\\theta(\\mathbf{r})|^2 = (\\nabla\\theta)^{*} \\cdot (\\nabla\\theta)$. We have:\n$$\n|\\nabla\\theta(\\mathbf{r})|^2 = \\left( \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}'} -i\\mathbf{q}' \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}'}^{*} e^{-i \\mathbf{q}' \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} i\\mathbf{q} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} e^{i \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} \\right) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{q}'} (\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{q}') \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}'}^{*} e^{i(\\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{q}') \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nNow, we integrate this expression over the area of the system, $L^2$:\n$$\n\\int d^2 r |\\nabla\\theta(\\mathbf{r})|^2 = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{q}'} (\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{q}') \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}'}^{*} \\int d^2 r \\, e^{i(\\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{q}') \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nThe integral over $\\mathbf{r}$ yields $L^2 \\delta_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{q}'}$, where $\\delta_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{q}'}$ is the Kronecker delta. Substituting this into the sum simplifies it to:\n$$\n\\int d^2 r |\\nabla\\theta(\\mathbf{r})|^2 = L^2 \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} |\\mathbf{q}|^2 |\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian in terms of the Fourier modes is therefore:\n$$\nH = \\frac{\\rho_s L^2}{2} \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} q^2 |\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2\n$$\nwhere $q = |\\mathbf{q}|$. The $\\mathbf{q}=0$ mode corresponds to a uniform rotation of the phase, which costs no energy ($q=0$), so it does not contribute to the Hamiltonian. The sum is over all non-zero wavevectors.\n\n**Step 3: Application of the Equipartition Theorem**\n\nThe Hamiltonian is a sum of independent quadratic terms. Each non-zero mode $\\mathbf{q}$ contributes to the energy. Let's write $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} = u_{\\mathbf{q}} + i v_{\\mathbf{q}}$. Using the reality condition $\\hat{\\theta}_{-\\mathbf{q}} = \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}^{*} = u_{\\mathbf{q}} - i v_{\\mathbf{q}}$, we can rewrite the energy contribution from a pair of modes $(\\mathbf{q}, -\\mathbf{q})$ (for $\\mathbf{q} \\neq 0$):\n$$\nH_{\\mathbf{q}, -\\mathbf{q}} = \\frac{\\rho_s L^2}{2} (q^2 |\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 + q^2 |\\hat{\\theta}_{-\\mathbf{q}}|^2) = \\rho_s L^2 q^2 |\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 = \\rho_s L^2 q^2 (u_{\\mathbf{q}}^2 + v_{\\mathbf{q}}^2)\n$$\nThe variables $u_{\\mathbf{q}}$ and $v_{\\mathbf{q}}$ are independent real variables for each unique wavevector in one half of the Brillouin zone. The Hamiltonian contains two independent quadratic degrees of freedom, $\\rho_s L^2 q^2 u_{\\mathbf{q}}^2$ and $\\rho_s L^2 q^2 v_{\\mathbf{q}}^2$, for each such pair. According to the classical equipartition theorem, each quadratic degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T$ to the average energy.\n$$\n\\langle \\rho_s L^2 q^2 u_{\\mathbf{q}}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\langle \\rho_s L^2 q^2 v_{\\mathbf{q}}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T\n$$\nFrom this, we find the average value of the squared amplitudes:\n$$\n\\langle u_{\\mathbf{q}}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{2 \\rho_s L^2 q^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\langle v_{\\mathbf{q}}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{2 \\rho_s L^2 q^2}\n$$\nThe average squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficient $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}$ is:\n$$\n\\langle |\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 \\rangle = \\langle u_{\\mathbf{q}}^2 \\rangle + \\langle v_{\\mathbf{q}}^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{\\rho_s L^2 q^2}\n$$\nThis holds for any $\\mathbf{q} \\neq 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of the Phase Variance $\\langle \\theta^2 \\rangle$**\n\nThe thermal variance of the phase field, $\\langle \\theta(\\mathbf{r})^2 \\rangle$, is independent of position $\\mathbf{r}$ due to translational invariance. We can calculate it at $\\mathbf{r}=0$:\n$$\n\\langle \\theta^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\theta(0)^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} \\right) \\left( \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}'} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}'} \\right) \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{q}'} \\langle \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}'} \\rangle\n$$\nSince the modes are independent in the harmonic approximation, $\\langle \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}'} \\rangle = 0$ unless $\\mathbf{q}' = -\\mathbf{q}$.\n$$\n\\langle \\theta^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\langle \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} \\hat{\\theta}_{-\\mathbf{q}} \\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\langle \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}} \\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}^{*} \\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\langle |\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 \\rangle\n$$\nWe sum over the fluctuating modes, i.e., $\\mathbf{q} \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\langle \\theta^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q} \\neq 0} \\frac{k_B T}{\\rho_s L^2 q^2}\n$$\nFollowing the problem's instruction, we convert this sum into an integral. The density of states in 2D $\\mathbf{q}$-space is $\\frac{L^2}{(2\\pi)^2}$, so the conversion is $\\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\to \\frac{L^2}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int d^2q$.\n$$\n\\langle \\theta^2 \\rangle = \\frac{L^2}{(2\\pi)^2} \\int \\frac{k_B T}{\\rho_s L^2 q^2} d^2q = \\frac{k_B T}{(2\\pi)^2 \\rho_s} \\int \\frac{d^2q}{q^2}\n$$\nThe integration is performed over an annular region in $\\mathbf{q}$-space defined by the IR and UV cutoffs, $q_{\\min} = 2\\pi/L$ and $q_{\\max} = \\pi/a$.

Rather than reproducing the entire complex derivation, we state the well-established one-loop result and provide its physical basis.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling $g$ in the $d=2$ $O(N)$ NLSM is given by:\n$$\\beta(g) = \\frac{dg}{d\\ln\\mu} = -\\frac{N-2}{2\\pi}g^2$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the momentum (energy) scale. The coefficient $N-2$ is crucial; it reflects the number of transverse Goldstone modes that dominate the low-energy fluctuations. For $N=2$ (the XY model), the target space $S^1$ is flat (zero curvature), and the one-loop beta function vanishes, leading to the distinct physics of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. For $N>2$, the target space is curved, leading to interactions between the Goldstone modes and a non-zero beta function.\n\nFor the $O(3)$ model relevant to the Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we have $N=3$. The beta function is:\n$$\\beta(g) = \\frac{dg}{d\\ln\\mu} = -\\frac{3-2}{2\\pi}g^2 = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi}g^2$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the coupling $g$ decreases as the energy scale $\\mu$ increases. This property is known as asymptotic freedom. Conversely, the coupling increases as the energy scale decreases (i.e., as the length scale increases), leading to strong coupling at low energies.\n\n**Step 3: Integration of the RG Flow and Correlation Length**\n\nWe now integrate the RG flow equation to find the relationship between the coupling and the scale. The flow equation is:\n$$\\frac{dg}{g^2} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} d\\ln\\mu$$\nWe integrate from the ultraviolet (UV) cutoff scale $\\Lambda$, corresponding to the lattice spacing $a$ (i.e., $\\Lambda \\sim 1/a$), down to a lower momentum scale $\\mu$. The coupling at the cutoff scale is the bare coupling $g(\\Lambda) = g_0 = T/\\rho_s$.\n$$\\int_{g_0}^{g(\\mu)} \\frac{dg'}{(g')^2} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\Lambda}^{\\mu} d\\ln\\mu'$$\n$$\\left[ -\\frac{1}{g'} \\right]_{g_0}^{g(\\mu)} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\ln\\mu' \\right]_{\\Lambda}^{\\mu}$$\n$$-\\frac{1}{g(\\mu)} + \\frac{1}{g_0} = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\Lambda}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Lambda}{\\mu}\\right)$$\n\nThe correlation length $\\xi(T)$ is defined as the characteristic length scale at which the system enters a strong-coupling regime, where the perturbative RG treatment breaks down. This occurs at a momentum scale $\\mu_\\xi \\sim 1/\\xi$. At this scale, the effective coupling $g(\\mu_\\xi)$ becomes of order unity. Let's denote this critical coupling value by $g_c$. Substituting $\\mu = 1/\\xi$ and $g(1/\\xi) = g_c$:\n$$-\\frac{1}{g_c} + \\frac{1}{g_0} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln(\\Lambda\\xi)$$\nSubstituting $g_0 = T/\\rho_s$:\n$$\\frac{\\rho_s}{T} - \\frac{1}{g_c} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln(\\Lambda\\xi)$$\nWe are interested in the low-temperature limit, where $T \\ll \\rho_s$. In this limit, the bare coupling $g_0 = T/\\rho_s$ is small, and the term $\\rho_s/T$ is much larger than the constant $1/g_c$. Thus, we can approximate:\n$$\\frac{\\rho_s}{T} \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\ln(\\Lambda\\xi)$$\nSolving for the correlation length $\\xi$:\n$$\\ln(\\Lambda\\xi) \\approx \\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}$$\n$$\\Lambda\\xi \\approx \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)$$\n$$\\xi(T) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\Lambda} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)$$\n\nTo obtain the reduced correlation length $\\xi/a$, we use the relation between the UV cutoff $\\Lambda$ and the lattice spacing $a$. The cutoff is of the order of the inverse lattice spacing, $\\Lambda = C_0/a$, where $C_0$ is a non-universal constant of order one that depends on the specific geometry of the lattice and the choice of the cutoff scheme.\n$$\\frac{\\xi(T)}{a} \\approx \\frac{1}{C_0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)$$\nThe expression contains a non-universal prefactor. The problem requests a single closed-form expression. The most essential physical content, representing the low-temperature growth, is the exponential term. The prefactor depends on scheme choices (e.g., the precise value for $C_0$ and $g_c$) not specified in the problem. A standard practice in such theoretical problems is to present the result with the prefactor set to unity, which amounts to a specific choice of scheme or a re-scaling of the reference lattice constant $a$. Adopting this convention provides the definitive form for the functional dependence.\n\nThus, the low-temperature growth of the reduced correlation length is given by:\n$$\\frac{\\xi(T)}{a} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)$$\nThis result shows that the correlation length diverges exponentially as $T \\to 0$, a hallmark of systems near a quantum critical point in $d=2$. This behavior is consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, which forbids long-range order at any $T>0$, but allows for a diverging correlation length as the ordered ground state is approached.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\pi\\rho_s}{T}\\right)}$$", "id": "3004670"}]}
