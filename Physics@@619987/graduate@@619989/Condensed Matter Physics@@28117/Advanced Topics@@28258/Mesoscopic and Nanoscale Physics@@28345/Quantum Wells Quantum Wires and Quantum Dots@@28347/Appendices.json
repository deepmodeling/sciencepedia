The system is governed by the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE). First, we derive the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions for this system.\n\nThe TISE is given as:\n$$\n-\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r})+V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi(\\mathbf{r})=E\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nInside the cubic box, defined by $0<x<L$, $0<y<L$, and $0<z<L$, the potential $V(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$. Outside the box, $V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\infty$, which imposes the boundary condition that the wavefunction $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ must be zero on the walls of the box.\n\nInside the box, the TISE simplifies to:\n$$\n-\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\dfrac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\dfrac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\\right)\\psi(x,y,z) = E\\psi(x,y,z)\n$$\nThis partial differential equation is separable in Cartesian coordinates. We propose a solution of the form $\\psi(x,y,z) = X(x)Y(y)Z(z)$. Substituting this into the TISE and dividing by $\\psi(x,y,z)$ yields:\n$$\n\\dfrac{1}{X(x)}\\left(-\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\dfrac{d^2X}{dx^2}\\right) + \\dfrac{1}{Y(y)}\\left(-\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\dfrac{d^2Y}{dy^2}\\right) + \\dfrac{1}{Z(z)}\\left(-\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\dfrac{d^2Z}{dz^2}\\right) = E\n$$\nSince each term on the left-hand side depends on a different independent variable, each term must be equal to a constant for their sum to be a constant $E$ for all $x,y,z$. Let these constants be $E_x$, $E_y$, and $E_z$, such that $E = E_x + E_y + E_z$. This separates the $3$D problem into three independent $1$D problems:\n$$\n-\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\dfrac{d^2X}{dx^2} = E_x X(x) \\quad \\text{with } X(0) = X(L) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\dfrac{d^2Y}{dy^2} = E_y Y(y) \\quad \\text{with } Y(0) = Y(L) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*}\\dfrac{d^2Z}{dz^2} = E_z Z(z) \\quad \\text{with } Z(0) = Z(L) = 0\n$$\nEach of these is the standard problem of a particle in a $1$D infinite potential well of length $L$.

The case $n_x=0$ would lead to a trivial wavefunction $X(x)=0$, which is not physically acceptable. Similar solutions hold for $Y(y)$ and $Z(z)$ with quantum numbers $n_y$ and $n_z$.\n\nThe total energy of a state, labeled by the triplet of positive integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$, is the sum of the energies for each dimension:\n$$\nE_{n_xn_yn_z} = E_{n_x} + E_{n_y} + E_{n_z} = \\dfrac{\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2m^*L^2}\\left(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2\\right)\n$$\nThe corresponding total wavefunction is $\\psi_{n_xn_yn_z}(x,y,z) = X_{n_x}(x)Y_{n_y}(y)Z_{n_z}(z)$.\n\nDegeneracy occurs when different states, characterized by distinct sets of quantum numbers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$, have the same energy. This happens when different combinations of quantum numbers yield the same value for the sum of squares $S = n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. The bound-state energies can be labeled by three positive integers $(n_x,n_y,n_z)$ and have the form $E_{n_xn_yn_z}=\\dfrac{\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2m^*L^2}\\left(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2\\right)$ with $n_x,n_y,n_z\\in\\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}$.**\nThis statement precisely matches the result of our derivation from first principles. The energy eigenvalues are determined by the sum of squares of three positive integer quantum numbers, and the prefactor $\\dfrac{\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2m^*L^2}$ is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The level labeled by the multiset $\\{1,1,2\\}$ is twofold degenerate when $L$ is the same along all three directions.**\nA level is labeled by a multiset when we refer to the set of quantum numbers, irrespective of their assignment to the $x$, $y$, or $z$ axes. For the multiset $\\{1,1,2\\}$, the possible distinct ordered triplets $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ are permutations of $(1,1,2)$. These are:\n$1$. $(1, 1, 2)$\n$2$. $(1, 2, 1)$\n$3$. $(2, 1, 1)$\nThere are $\\dfrac{3!}{2!1!} = 3$ distinct permutations. Each corresponds to a unique wavefunction $\\psi_{n_xn_yn_z}$ but has the same energy, because the sum of squares is invariant under permutation: $1^2+1^2+2^2 = 1^2+2^2+1^2 = 2^2+1^2+1^2 = 6$. The energy is $E = \\dfrac{6\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2m^*L^2}$. Since there are three distinct states with this energy, the level is threefold degenerate. The statement claims it is twofold degenerate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For the level labeled by the multiset $\\{1,2,3\\}$, the degeneracy arising from cubic symmetry alone is $6$.**\nThe degeneracy arising from cubic symmetry corresponds to the number of distinct states one can form by permuting the quantum numbers. For the multiset $\\{1,2,3\\}$, all three quantum numbers are different. The number of distinct permutations of these three numbers is $3! = 3\\times2\\times1 = 6$. The explicit states are $(1,2,3)$, $(1,3,2)$, $(2,1,3)$, $(2,3,1)$, $(3,1,2)$, and $(3,2,1)$. All of these have the same sum of squares $1^2+2^2+3^2 = 1+4+9 = 14$ and thus the same energy. This 6-fold degeneracy is a direct consequence of the Hamiltonian's invariance under interchange of the coordinate axes, i.e., the cubic symmetry of the box.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. There exist accidental degeneracies between levels with different multisets, for example between $(3,3,3)$ and $(1,1,5)$.**\nAccidental degeneracies occur when different multisets of quantum numbers yield the same sum of squares. Let's check the provided example.\nThe state specified by the triplet $(3,3,3)$ corresponds to the multiset $\\{3,3,3\\}$. The sum of squares is $S_1 = 3^2+3^2+3^2 = 9+9+9 = 27$. This level is non-degenerate with respect to permutations.\nThe states specified by permutations of $(1,1,5)$ correspond to the multiset $\\{1,1,5\\}$. The sum of squares is $S_2 = 1^2+1^2+5^2 = 1+1+25 = 27$.\nSince $S_1 = S_2$, the energy level $E = \\dfrac{27\\hbar^2\\pi^2}{2m^*L^2}$ is shared by states originating from two different multisets, $\\{3,3,3\\}$ and $\\{1,1,5\\}$. This is the definition of an accidental degeneracy. The total degeneracy of this level is the sum of the degeneracies of the contributing multisets: $1$ (for $\\{3,3,3\\}$) $+ 3$ (for $\\{1,1,5\\}$) $= 4$. The statement correctly identifies that such degeneracies exist and provides a valid example.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. All degeneracies in the cubic infinite well arise solely from permutations of $(n_x,n_y,n_z)$; consequently, levels such as $(3,3,3)$ and $(1,1,5)$ can never be degenerate.**\nThis statement makes a universal claim that \"all degeneracies\" are of the permutational (symmetry-enforced) type. This is equivalent to stating that accidental degeneracies do not exist. As a consequence, it claims that levels from different multisets, such as those corresponding to $\\{3,3,3\\}$ and $\\{1,1,5\\}$, can never be degenerate. Our analysis for option D directly contradicts this. We explicitly showed that the state $(3,3,3)$ and the states from the multiset $\\{1,1,5\\}$ are indeed degenerate. Therefore, the premise (\"All degeneracies arise solely from permutations\") is false, and the stated consequence is also false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2855352"}, {"introduction": "Moving from idealized boxes to more realistic scenarios, we now consider the triangular quantum well, a crucial model for describing the two-dimensional electron gas that forms at a semiconductor heterojunction under an electric field.

We will first determine the scattering matrix $S$ from the given physical constraints and then apply the Landauer-Büttiker formalism for quantum transport.\n\nThe system consists of $3$ semi-infinite, single-mode leads. The scattering properties at the junction are described by a $3 \\times 3$ scattering matrix $S$. The matrix elements $S_{ij}$ relate the amplitude of the outgoing mode in lead $i$ to the amplitude of the incoming mode in lead $j$.\n\nThe problem states three constraints on $S$:\n1.  Current conservation (unitarity): $S^{\\dagger}S = I$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix.\n2.  Time-reversal symmetry: $S$ can be chosen to be real and symmetric, so $S^T = S$ and $S^* = S$. This implies $S^{\\dagger} = S^T = S$. The unitarity condition then simplifies to $S^2 = I$.\n3.  Permutation symmetry: The node is symmetric with respect to the permutation of any of the three leads. This implies that all diagonal elements of $S$ are equal to some real number $r$, and all off-diagonal elements are equal to some real number $t$.\n\nFrom these constraints, the scattering matrix $S$ must have the form:\n$$ S = \\begin{pmatrix} r & t & t \\\\ t & r & t \\\\ t & t & r \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we apply the simplified unitarity condition $S^2 = I$:\n$$ S^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} r & t & t \\\\ t & r & t \\\\ t & t & r \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} r & t & t \\\\ t & r & t \\\\ t & t & r \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r^2 + 2t^2 & 2rt + t^2 & 2rt + t^2 \\\\ 2rt + t^2 & r^2 + 2t^2 & 2rt + t^2 \\\\ 2rt + t^2 & 2rt + t^2 & r^2 + 2t^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor $S^2$ to be equal to the identity matrix $I = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, the elements of $S^2$ must satisfy:\n1. $r^2 + 2t^2 = 1$\n2. $2rt + t^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, we have $t(2r + t) = 0$. This gives two possible solutions:\nCase A: $t=0$. Substituting this into the first equation gives $r^2 = 1$, so $r = \\pm 1$. This corresponds to $S = \\pm I$, which describes three disconnected leads with perfect reflection. This is a trivial case, not a junction, so we discard it.\nCase B: $t = -2r$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$ r^2 + 2(-2r)^2 = 1 $$\n$$ r^2 + 2(4r^2) = 1 $$\n$$ 9r^2 = 1 \\implies r^2 = \\frac{1}{9} \\implies r = \\pm \\frac{1}{3} $$\nIf $r = -1/3$, then $t = -2(-1/3) = 2/3$.\nIf $r = 1/3$, then $t = -2(1/3) = -2/3$.\nBoth solutions yield the same transmission and reflection probabilities, as these depend on the squared magnitudes of the S-matrix elements. Let us choose $r = -1/3$ and $t = 2/3$. The scattering matrix is:\n$$ S = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 2 & -1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe transmission probability from lead $j$ to lead $i$ is $T_{ij} = |S_{ij}|^2$.\nThe reflection probability for lead $i$ is $T_{ii} = |S_{ii}|^2 = r^2 = (-1/3)^2 = 1/9$.\nThe transmission probability between any two different leads $i \\neq j$ is $T_{ij} = |S_{ij}|^2 = t^2 = (2/3)^2 = 4/9$.\n\nWe now use the Landauer-Büttiker formula for the net current $I_i$ flowing from terminal $i$ into the device at zero temperature:\n$$ I_i = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum_{j \\ne i} T_{ji}(V_j - V_i) $$\nwhere the factor of $2$ accounts for spin degeneracy. Since $S$ is symmetric, $T_{ji} = T_{ij}$.\nThe problem specifies the voltages $V_1 = V$ and $V_2 = V_3 = 0$.\n\nThe total current injected *from* lead $1$ into the device is the net current $I_1$:\n$$ I_1 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left[ T_{12}(V_1-V_2) + T_{13}(V_1-V_3) \\right] $$\n$$ I_{inj,1} = I_1 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left[ T_{21}(V-0) + T_{31}(V-0) \\right] = \\frac{2e^2}{h} (T_{21} + T_{31}) V $$\nUsing $T_{21} = T_{31} = 4/9$, we get:\n$$ I_{inj,1} = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left(\\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{4}{9}\\right) V = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{8}{9} V $$\nThis is the total net current flowing from the source at lead $1$ into the junction.\n\nThe current exiting *through* lead $2$ is the net current flowing from the device *into* lead $2$. This is equal to $-I_2$. Let's calculate the net current at terminal $I_2$:\n$$ I_2 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left[ T_{21}(V_2-V_1) + T_{23}(V_2-V_3) \\right] $$\n$$ I_2 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\left[ T_{21}(0-V) + T_{23}(0-0) \\right] = -\\frac{2e^2}{h} T_{21} V $$\nSince $T_{21} = 4/9$:\n$$ I_2 = -\\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{4}{9} V $$\nThe negative sign confirms that the net current flow is out of the device and into lead $2$. The magnitude of the current exiting through lead $2$, denoted $I_{out,2}$, is:\n$$ I_{out,2} = -I_2 = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{4}{9} V $$\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction $F$ of the current injected from lead $1$ that exits through lead $2$:\n$$ F = \\frac{I_{out,2}}{I_{inj,1}} $$\n$$ F = \\frac{\\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{4}{9} V}{\\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{8}{9} V} = \\frac{4/9}{8/9} = \\frac{4}{8} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nAlternatively, we can arrive at this result from a direct symmetry argument. The current injected from lead $1$ must be distributed among the other leads. With the applied voltages, current flows out through leads $2$ and $3$, which are both grounded. The permutation symmetry of the junction, explicitly stated as $S_{12}=S_{13}=t$, means the transmission probabilities $T_{21} = |S_{21}|^2$ and $T_{31} = |S_{31}|^2$ are identical. Since leads $2$ and $3$ are indistinguishable from the perspective of lead $1$ and are at the same potential, the outgoing current must split equally between them. Therefore, half of the injected current exits through lead $2$ and the other half through lead $3$. This gives $F = 1/2$ without needing the explicit values of $r$ and $t$, as long as a non-trivial junction ($t \\neq 0$) exists. Our derivation confirms this is the case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2855289"}]}
