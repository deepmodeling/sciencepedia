Such systems are fundamental to modern electronic devices like High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMTs). A crucial characteristic of a 2DEG is its 'degeneracy temperature', which marks the approximate threshold below which the quantum nature of electrons, governed by Fermi-Dirac statistics, becomes dominant over classical thermal behavior.\n\nConsider a 2DEG formed within a Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) quantum well.

This temperature, often called the Fermi temperature $T_F$, is defined by the relation $E_F = k_B T_F$, where $E_F$ is the Fermi energy and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. To find $T_F$, we must first determine the Fermi energy $E_F$ for a 2D system.\n\nThe Fermi energy is the highest energy level occupied by an electron at absolute zero temperature ($T=0$ K). To find its relationship with the sheet carrier density $n_s$, we first need the density of states (DOS) for a 2D system.\n\nFor a non-interacting electron gas in two dimensions, the allowed states in momentum space (or k-space) are quantized. In a square sample of area $A = L \\times L$, the allowed $k$-vectors form a grid where each state occupies an area of $(\\frac{2\\pi}{L})^2$.

It is a standard problem in the physics of low-dimensional electron systems. We shall proceed with its formal derivation.\n\nThe system is a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined along one dimension in an infinitely deep square quantum well of width $L$. The electron energy spectrum consists of a series of subbands, where for each subband $n$ (with $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$), the energy dispersion is given by:\n$$E(k) = E_n + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m^*}$$\nHere, $E_n$ is the energy minimum of the $n$-th subband, $m^*$ is the effective mass, and $k$ is the magnitude of the in-plane wavevector.\n\nThe problem states that the two-dimensional density of states (DOS) for a single subband is constant with respect to energy. To be rigorous, we first derive this. The number of states $dN$ in k-space within an annulus of radius $k$ and thickness $dk$ is proportional to the area of this annulus, $2\\pi k \\, dk$. For a system of area $A$, the number of states per unit area is $\\frac{2\\pi k \\, dk}{(2\\pi)^2/A} = \\frac{A k \\, dk}{2\\pi}$. The density of states per unit energy, per unit area is $D(E) = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dN}{dE} = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dN}{dk} \\frac{dk}{dE}$. From the dispersion relation, $E - E_n = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m^*}$, we find $k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m^*(E-E_n)}}{\\hbar}$. Differentiating gives $\\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k}{m^*}$, so $\\frac{dk}{dE} = \\frac{m^*}{\\hbar^2 k}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the DOS:\n$$D(E) = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{A k}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{m^*}{\\hbar^2 k}\\right) = \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2}$$\nThis is indeed a constant for $E \\ge E_n$. This DOS is for one spin state and one valley. Accounting for spin degeneracy $g_s$ and valley degeneracy $g_v$, the total DOS for the $n$-th subband is:\n$$D_n(E) = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\quad \\text{for } E \\ge E_n$$\nand $D_n(E) = 0$ for $E < E_n$. This can be written compactly using the Heaviside step function $\\Theta(x)$ as $D_n(E) = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} \\Theta(E - E_n)$.\n\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), electrons occupy all available energy states up to the Fermi energy, $E_F$. The sheet carrier density in the $n$-th subband, $n_n$, is obtained by integrating the subband DOS from its minimum $E_n$ up to $E_F$:\n$$n_n = \\int_{E_n}^{E_F} D_n(E) dE = \\int_{E_n}^{E_F} g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} dE$$\nSince the integrand is constant over the integration range, this yields:\n$$n_n = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} (E_F - E_n), \\quad \\text{for } E_F \\ge E_n$$\nIf $E_F < E_n$, the subband is empty and $n_n = 0$. The total sheet carrier density $n_s$ is the sum over all occupied subbands: $n_s = \\sum_n n_n$.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical sheet density $n_{s,\\mathrm{crit}}$ at which the second subband ($n=2$) begins to populate. This occurs precisely when the Fermi energy $E_F$ becomes equal to the energy minimum of the second subband, $E_2$.\n$$E_F = E_2$$\nAt this critical point, only the subbands with energy minima $E_n \\le E_2$ can be populated. In this case, this includes the first subband ($n=1$) and the second subband ($n=2$). However, for the second subband, the occupancy $n_2$ is:\n$$n_2 = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} (E_F - E_2) = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} (E_2 - E_2) = 0$$\nThus, at the onset of its population, the second subband contains zero electrons. All higher subbands ($n > 2$) are also empty. Therefore, the total carrier density $n_s$ is comprised entirely of electrons in the first subband:\n$$n_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = n_1$$\nWe calculate $n_1$ by setting $E_F = E_2$ in its population formula:\n$$n_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = g_s g_v \\frac{m^*}{2\\pi\\hbar^2} (E_2 - E_1)$$\nThe subband energies for an infinite quantum well of width $L$ are given as:\n$$E_n = E_c + \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\pi^2 n^2}{2 m^* L^2}$$\nwhere $E_c$ is a constant reference energy.

The effective mass $m^*$ cancels. The reduced Planck constant squared $\\hbar^2$ cancels. One factor of $\\pi$ in the numerator cancels with the $\\pi$ in the denominator. This yields the final expression:\n$$n_{s,\\mathrm{crit}} = g_s g_v \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{3\\pi}{2 L^2} \\right) = \\frac{3\\pi g_s g_v}{4 L^2}$$\nThis result shows that the critical density is determined only by the quantum well width $L$ and the degeneracies $g_s$ and $g_v$, and is independent of the effective mass $m^*$.

These levels are separated by energy gaps. The longitudinal resistivity, $\\rho_{xx}$, is a measure of dissipative electron transport. Such transport relies on scattering events, which require electrons to transition from an occupied state to an available unoccupied state at the same energy.\nWhen the filling factor $\\nu$ is an integer, it means that an integer number of Landau levels are completely filled with electrons, and the Fermi energy, $E_F$, lies within the energy gap between the highest filled Landau level and the lowest empty one. At low temperatures, there are no available states for electrons at the Fermi energy to scatter into. Consequently, scattering processes are profoundly suppressed. In an idealized system, this suppression leads to a vanishing longitudinal resistivity, $\\rho_{xx} = 0$. In real systems, some disorder is always present, which creates localized states within the energy gaps. When $E_F$ lies in the region of these localized states, the electrons occupying them are immobile and cannot contribute to conduction. The current is carried by dissipationless \"edge states\" that are robust to scattering. Therefore, integer filling factors correspond to deep minima in $\\rho_{xx}$, which is the signature of the integer quantum Hall effect.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2.068} $$", "id": "2868947"}]}
