A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested: first, a dimensional analysis of the terms in the Landauer formula, and second, a numerical calculation of the conductance prefactor.\n\n**Part 1: Dimensional Analysis**\n\nThe total conductance is given by the expression $G = \\frac{2 e^{2}}{h} \\sum_{n} T_{n}$. For this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the right-hand side must have the units of conductance. We will analyze the dimensions of the summation term and the prefactor separately.\n\nFirst, consider the term $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$. The quantity $T_n$ is defined as the transmission probability for the $n$-th mode. A probability is a ratio of like quantities (e.g., transmitted flux over incident flux) and is therefore a pure, dimensionless number. A summation of dimensionless numbers, $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$, results in a dimensionless quantity. Therefore, the term $\\sum_{n} T_{n}$ is dimensionless.\n\nNext, we analyze the dimensions of the prefactor, $\\frac{2 e^{2}}{h}$. The factor of $2$ arises from spin degeneracy and is a dimensionless pure number. We denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $X$ by $[X]$. The elementary charge $e$ has the dimension of charge, $[e] = Q$, which is the Coulomb ($C$) in SI units. Planck's constant $h$ has dimensions of energy multiplied by time, $[h] = E \\cdot T$. In SI units, this is Joule-second ($J \\cdot s$). The dimensions of the prefactor are therefore:\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{e^2}{h}\\right] = \\frac{[e]^2}{[h]} = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nIn SI units, this is $\\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}$.\n\nNow, we must verify that these are the dimensions of conductance. Conductance $G$ is defined as the ratio of current $I$ to voltage $V$: $G = I/V$. The dimension of current, which is the rate of flow of charge, is $[I] = Q/T$. In SI units, this is Ampere ($A$), where $1\\,A = 1\\,C/s$. The dimension of voltage (electric potential difference), which is energy per unit charge, is $[V] = E/Q$. In SI units, this is Volt ($V$), where $1\\,V = 1\\,J/C$.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of conductance are:\n$$\n[G] = \\frac{[I]}{[V]} = \\frac{Q/T}{E/Q} = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nIn SI units, this corresponds to $\\frac{C/s}{J/C} = \\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}$. This unit is defined as the Siemens ($S$).\n\nComparing the dimensions of the prefactor $\\frac{e^2}{h}$ with the dimensions of conductance $G$, we find they are identical.\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{e^2}{h}\\right] = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad [G] = \\frac{Q^2}{E \\cdot T}\n$$\nThis confirms that the prefactor $\\frac{2e^2}{h}$ has units of conductance. Since the summation term is dimensionless, the entire expression for $G$ correctly has the units of conductance, validating the dimensional consistency of the Landauer formula.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the numerical value of the prefactor, which is known as the quantum of conductance, $G_0 = \\frac{2 e^2}{h}$.\nThe given values for the constants are:\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,C$.\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,J \\cdot s$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for $G_0$:\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 e^2}{h} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,C)^2}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,J \\cdot s}\n$$\nLet's calculate the numerical value:\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634)^2 \\times 10^{-38}}{6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}} \\frac{C^2}{J \\cdot s}\n$$\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{2 \\times 2.566970054...}{6.62607015} \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 = \\frac{5.133940108...}{6.62607015} \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 0.7748091729... \\times 10^{-4} \\, S\n$$\n$$\nG_0 \\approx 7.748091729... \\times 10^{-5} \\, S\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in microsiemens ($\\mu S$).

The first five significant figures are $7, 7, 4, 8, 0$.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to compute the linear-response conductance $G=I/V$ for a perfect one-dimensional channel using two formalisms and show their equivalence.\n\n### 1. Scattering-State Counting Approach (Landauer-Büttiker Formalism)\n\nThis approach views electrical current as a flux of charge carriers in scattering states. The net current is the difference between the charge flux originating from the left reservoir and moving to the right, and the charge flux from the right reservoir moving to the left.\n\nThe current carried by electrons in a single channel within an infinitesimal energy interval $dE$ is given by the product of the charge $-e$, the number of available states per unit energy, the group velocity of the carriers, and the probability that the states are occupied.\n\nThe problem provides a crucial property of a one-dimensional channel: the product of the group velocity $v(E)$ and the one-dimensional density of states per unit length, per spin, and per propagation direction, $D_{1D, \\sigma, \\rightarrow}(E)$, is a universal constant.\n$$\nv(E) \\cdot D_{1D, \\sigma, \\rightarrow}(E) = \\frac{1}{h}\n$$\nThe quantity $v(E) \\cdot D_{1D, \\sigma, \\rightarrow}(E) \\cdot dE$ represents the number of states per second, per spin, and per direction, within the energy range $dE$. Therefore, the number of states supplied by a reservoir per unit time in the energy interval $dE$ is $\\frac{1}{h}dE$ for each spin channel and each direction.\n\nThe channel is spin-degenerate, meaning there are two independent channels (spin-up and spin-down). It is also reflectionless, so the transmission probability $\\mathcal{T}(E)$ for any electron entering the channel is unity, $\\mathcal{T}(E)=1$.\n\nThe charge current from left to right, $I_{\\rightarrow}$, is carried by electrons from the left reservoir, which has occupation function $f_L(E) = f(E-\\mu_L)$. The current from right to left, $I_{\\leftarrow}$, is from the right reservoir with occupation $f_R(E) = f(E-\\mu_R)$. The net current $I$ flowing from left to right is the sum of contributions from both reservoirs (taking direction into account).\n\nThe contribution from the left reservoir is:\n$$\nI_{L \\rightarrow R} = \\sum_{\\text{spins}} \\int dE \\cdot e \\cdot (\\text{rate of states}) \\cdot \\mathcal{T}(E) \\cdot f_L(E)\n$$\nHere, the sum over spins gives a factor of $2$. The rate of states is $1/h$.\n$$\nI_{L \\rightarrow R} = 2 \\int dE \\frac{e}{h} \\cdot 1 \\cdot f_L(E) = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int f_L(E) dE\n$$\nSimilarly, the contribution from the right reservoir gives a current flowing from right to left:\n$$\nI_{R \\rightarrow L} = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int f_R(E) dE\n$$\nThe net current $I$ from left to right is the difference:\n$$\nI = I_{L \\rightarrow R} - I_{R \\rightarrow L} = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int \\left[ f_L(E) - f_R(E) \\right] dE\n$$\nThis is the celebrated Landauer formula for a two-terminal device.\n\nNow, we apply the specific conditions. The temperature is $T=0$, so the Fermi-Dirac distributions are step functions: $f(E-\\mu) = \\Theta(\\mu-E)$, where $\\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. The chemical potentials are $\\mu_{L}=\\mu+\\tfrac{eV}{2}$ and $\\mu_{R}=\\mu-\\tfrac{eV}{2}$.\nThe difference in Fermi functions is:\n$$\nf_L(E) - f_R(E) = \\Theta\\left(\\mu+\\tfrac{eV}{2} - E\\right) - \\Theta\\left(\\mu-\\tfrac{eV}{2} - E\\right)\n$$\nThis difference is $1$ for $E$ in the energy window $[\\mu - \\tfrac{eV}{2}, \\mu + \\tfrac{eV}{2}]$ and $0$ otherwise. We assume $V>0$.\nThe integral for the current becomes:\n$$\nI = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int_{\\mu - eV/2}^{\\mu + eV/2} (1) dE\n$$\n$$\nI = \\frac{2e}{h} \\left[ \\left(\\mu + \\frac{eV}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\mu - \\frac{eV}{2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2e}{h} (eV) = \\frac{2e^2}{h} V\n$$\nThe linear-response conductance $G$ is the ratio of current to voltage:\n$$\nG = \\frac{I}{V} = \\frac{2e^2}{h}\n$$\n\n### 2. Nonequilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) Approach\n\nThis formalism provides a more rigorous, microscopic framework. The current is calculated from the quantum statistical average of the current operator. For a non-interacting system in steady state, the current flowing from lead $\\alpha$ into the central device region can be expressed via the Meir-Wingreen formula. For a two-terminal setup (leads $L$ and $R$), the net current $I=I_L=-I_R$ is given by:\n$$\nI = \\frac{e}{\\hbar} \\int \\frac{dE}{2\\pi} \\left[f_L(E) - f_R(E)\\right] \\text{Tr}\\left[ \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{L}(E) \\mathbf{G}^{r}(E) \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{R}(E) \\mathbf{G}^{a}(E) \\right]\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{G}^{r,a}$ are the retarded and advanced Green's function matrices for the device (the 1D channel), and $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{\\alpha}(E) = i[\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\alpha}^r(E) - \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_{\\alpha}^a(E)]$ are the lead linewidth function matrices, which describe the coupling strength to the leads. The trace is over the internal degrees of freedom of the channel (in this case, spin). The expression inside the trace is defined as the total transmission probability matrix $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E) = \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{L}(E) \\mathbf{G}^{r}(E) \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{R}(E) \\mathbf{G}^{a}(E)\n$$\nThe full expression for the current, using $h=2\\pi\\hbar$, is:\n$$\nI = \\frac{e}{h} \\int dE \\left[f_L(E) - f_R(E)\\right] \\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)]\n$$\nThe problem states the channel is spin-degenerate and supports exactly one propagating mode for each spin. The channel is also \"reflectionless\" and \"translationally invariant.\" In the NEGF language, this implies that the leads are perfectly matched to the channel. For a perfect 1D quantum wire, this means that an electron entering the channel from a lead propagates without any reflection.\nConsequently, for a given spin, the transmission probability is unity. Since the two spin channels are independent, the transmission matrix $\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)$ is a $2 \\times 2$ diagonal matrix:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nfor energies where the modes exist. The trace is therefore $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)] = 1+1=2$.\n\nSubstituting this into the current formula:\n$$\nI = \\frac{e}{h} \\int dE \\left[f_L(E) - f_R(E)\\right] \\cdot 2 = \\frac{2e}{h} \\int \\left[f_L(E) - f_R(E)\\right] dE\n$$\nThis is precisely the same integral expression obtained from the scattering-state approach. Evaluating it under the same $T=0$ and small $V$ conditions yields the identical result:\n$$\nI = \\frac{2e^2}{h} V\n$$\nAnd the conductance is:\n$$\nG = \\frac{I}{V} = \\frac{2e^2}{h}\n$$\n\n### 3. Equivalence of the Formalisms\n\nThe two derivations produce the same expression for the current and hence the same conductance. The equivalence is established by identifying the correspondence between the key physical quantities in each model.\n\n1.  In the **scattering-state approach**, the current is proportional to the number of available conducting channels (here, $2$ for spin degeneracy) multiplied by a phenomenological transmission probability $\\mathcal{T}(E)$, which was taken to be $1$ for a perfect channel. The fundamental rate of states per channel, $\\frac{1}{h}$, is derived from the properties of 1D systems, namely $v(E) D_{1D}(E)_{\\text{per spin, dir}} = 1/h$.\n\n2.  In the **NEGF approach**, the current is proportional to the trace of the transmission matrix, $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)] = \\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{L} \\mathbf{G}^{r} \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{R} \\mathbf{G}^{a}]$. This expression is the rigorous, microscopic definition of the total transmission probability across all channels.\n\nThe equivalence lies in the fact that for the idealized system under consideration, the microscopic NEGF calculation of the total transmission, $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)]$, evaluates to exactly the number of channels assumed in the simpler Landauer picture. The physical premise of a \"reflectionless, single-mode channel per spin\" in the problem statement allows us to deduce that $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\mathcal{T}}(E)]=2$. This value, inserted into the general Meir-Wingreen formula, reduces it to the specific Landauer formula used in the first part.\n\nThus, the NEGF formalism provides a microscopic justification for the phenomenological parameters (number of channels, transmission probability) used in the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. The step that establishes the equivalence is the recognition that $\\text{Tr}[\\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{L} \\mathbf{G}^{r} \\mathbf{\\Gamma}_{R} \\mathbf{G}^{a}]$ is the formal equivalent of the sum of transmission probabilities over all channels, $\\sum_{n} \\mathcal{T}_n(E)$. For this perfect system, both equal $2$.\n\nIn conclusion, both methods correctly predict that the conductance of a single, perfect, spin-degenerate one-dimensional channel is quantized in units of $e^2/h$.

Therefore, we set $\\mathrm{Re}[\\Sigma^R(E)] = 0$.\n\nIn the wide-band limit, with $\\Gamma_{\\alpha}(E) = \\Gamma_{\\alpha}$, the self-energy becomes a constant complex number:\n$$\n\\Sigma^R(E) = -\\frac{i}{2} (\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R) = -i\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma \\equiv \\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R$. Substituting this into the Dyson equation:\n$$\nG_{dd}^R(E) = \\left[ (E - \\epsilon_0) - \\left(-i\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right) \\right]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_0 + i\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}}\n$$\nNow, we can compute $|G_{dd}^R(E)|^2$:\n$$\n|G_{dd}^R(E)|^2 = \\left| \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_0 + i\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}} \\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{(E - \\epsilon_0)^2 + (\\frac{\\Gamma}{2})^2}\n$$\nFinally, substituting this into the expression for $T(E)$, we get the Breit-Wigner form for the transmission probability:\n$$\nT(E) = \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(E - \\epsilon_0)^2 + (\\frac{\\Gamma}{2})^2} = \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(E - \\epsilon_0)^2 + (\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2})^2}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic form for $T(E)$.\n\n(ii) Peak transmission $T_{\\max}$:\n\nThe transmission probability $T(E)$ is a Lorentzian function of energy $E$, centered at $\\epsilon_0$. The maximum value, $T_{\\max}$, occurs when the denominator is minimal, which happens at the resonance energy $E = \\epsilon_0$.\n$$\nT_{\\max} = T(E=\\epsilon_0) = \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\epsilon_0 - \\epsilon_0)^2 + (\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2})^2} = \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\frac{\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R}{2})^2}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\max} = \\frac{4 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2}\n$$\n\n(iii) Full width at half maximum, $\\mathrm{FWHM}$:\n\nThe $\\mathrm{FWHM}$ is the energy width of the resonance peak at half of its maximum height, $T(E) = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\max}$. Let the energies at which this occurs be $E_{\\pm}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(E_{\\pm} - \\epsilon_0)^2 + (\\frac{\\Gamma}{2})^2} = \\frac{1}{2} T_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2})^2}\n$$\nCanceling the common factor $\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R$ and inverting both sides gives:\n$$\n(E_{\\pm} - \\epsilon_0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right)^2 = 2 \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n(E_{\\pm} - \\epsilon_0)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\nTaking the square root, we get $E_{\\pm} - \\epsilon_0 = \\pm \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}$, which gives the two energies $E_{\\pm} = \\epsilon_0 \\pm \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}$. The $\\mathrm{FWHM}$ is the difference between these two energies:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FWHM} = E_{+} - E_{-} = \\left(\\epsilon_0 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\epsilon_0 - \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\right) = \\Gamma\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\Gamma$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FWHM} = \\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R\n$$\n\n(iv) Peak conductance $G_{\\mathrm{pk}}$:\n\nThe Landauer formula for conductance $G$ at zero temperature relates it to the transmission probability at the Fermi energy, $T(E_F)$. For a spin-degenerate system, the formula is:\n$$\nG = \\frac{2e^2}{h} T(E_F)\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, and the factor of $2$ accounts for spin degeneracy. The peak conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{pk}}$, is achieved when the Fermi energy is tuned to the resonance, i.e., $E_F = \\epsilon_0$.\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{pk}} = G(E_F = \\epsilon_0) = \\frac{2e^2}{h} T(E=\\epsilon_0) = \\frac{2e^2}{h} T_{\\max}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_{\\max}$:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{4 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2}\n$$\n\n(v) Asymmetry ratio $r^{\\ast}$ for unit transmission:\n\nWe seek the value of the asymmetry ratio $r = \\Gamma_L / \\Gamma_R$ for which transmission is perfect at resonance, i.e., $T_{\\max} = 1$.\n$$\nT_{\\max} = \\frac{4 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2} = 1\n$$\n$$\n4 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R = (\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2 = \\Gamma_L^2 + 2\\Gamma_L\\Gamma_R + \\Gamma_R^2\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\Gamma_L^2 - 2\\Gamma_L\\Gamma_R + \\Gamma_R^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\Gamma_L - \\Gamma_R)^2 = 0\n$$\nThis implies that $\\Gamma_L = \\Gamma_R$. This condition, known as symmetric coupling, is required for perfect transmission. The corresponding asymmetry ratio $r^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\nr^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\Gamma_L}{\\Gamma_R} = 1\n$$\n\nThe final report consists of the ordered quintuple of these five results.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(E - \\epsilon_0)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\Gamma_L+\\Gamma_R}{2}\\right)^2} & \\frac{4 \\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R)^2} & \\Gamma_L + \\Gamma_R & \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\frac{4\\Gamma_L \\Gamma_R}{(\\Gamma_L+\\Gamma_R)^2} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2999615"}]}
