It represents a canonical problem in the field of mesoscopic condensed matter physics, specifically the study of full counting statistics (FCS) in quantum transport. I will therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe system consists of a single-channel quantum conductor between two reservoirs at zero temperature, $T_{\\text{temp}}=0 \\, \\text{K}$. The reservoirs have a difference in chemical potential of $\\Delta\\mu = \\mu_\\mathrm{L} - \\mu_\\mathrm{R} = eV$. At zero temperature, the Fermi-Dirac distribution is a step function. All electronic states in the left reservoir are filled up to energy $\\mu_\\mathrm{L}$, and all states in the right reservoir are filled up to $\\mu_\\mathrm{R}$. Consequently, electronic transport can only occur from the left reservoir to the right reservoir, for electrons with energies in the interval $E \\in [\\mu_\\mathrm{R}, \\mu_\\mathrm{L}]$, which has a width of $eV$.\n\nFor a one-dimensional, single-channel, spinless conductor, the number of available quantum states, $N$, incident on the scatterer from the left reservoir during a time interval $\\tau$ within the energy window $\\Delta E = eV$ is given by the product of the measurement time and the flux of states. The flux of states per unit energy is $1/h$. Therefore, the total number of single-particle states attempting to transmit is:\n$$ N = \\frac{\\Delta E}{h} \\tau = \\frac{eV\\tau}{h} $$\nThese $N$ states correspond to $N$ incident electrons, each occupying a distinct orthogonal quantum state, a direct consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle. The influx of electrons is thus perfectly deterministic and noiseless.\n\nEach of these $N$ electrons attempts to cross the conductor and is transmitted with a probability $T$ or reflected with a probability $R=1-T$. Since the electrons are in orthogonal states, their scattering events are independent. This scenario is mathematically equivalent to a series of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials, where \"success\" is the transmission of an electron.\n\nThe probability, $P(n)$, that exactly $n$ electrons out of $N$ are transmitted is therefore given by the binomial distribution:\n$$ P(n) = \\binom{N}{n} T^n (1-T)^{N-n} $$\nwhere $n$ can take integer values from $0$ to $N$. This is the probability distribution for the number of transmitted electrons as requested.\n\nThe total charge transferred in time $\\tau$ is $Q = ne$, where $n$ is the number of transmitted electrons. The cumulants of the charge, $C_k(Q)$, are related to the cumulants of the number of electrons, $C_k(n)$, by the relation $C_k(Q) = e^k C_k(n)$. We can find the cumulants of the binomial distribution using its cumulant-generating function (CGF), $K_n(s)$, which is the natural logarithm of the moment-generating function (MGF), $M_n(s)$.\n\nThe MGF for the binomial distribution is:\n$$ M_n(s) = E[\\exp(sn)] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\exp(sn) \\binom{N}{n} T^n (1-T)^{N-n} $$\n$$ M_n(s) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\binom{N}{n} (T\\exp(s))^n (1-T)^{N-n} $$\nBy the binomial theorem, this simplifies to:\n$$ M_n(s) = (T\\exp(s) + 1 - T)^N $$\nThe CGF is therefore:\n$$ K_n(s) = \\ln(M_n(s)) = N \\ln(T\\exp(s) + 1 - T) $$\nThe $k$-th cumulant is found by taking the $k$-th derivative of the CGF with respect to $s$ and evaluating it at $s=0$:\n$$ C_k(n) = \\left. \\frac{d^k K_n(s)}{ds^k} \\right|_{s=0} $$\nFor the first cumulant, $C_1(n)$ (the mean):\n$$ \\frac{dK_n}{ds} = N \\frac{T\\exp(s)}{T\\exp(s) + 1 - T} $$\n$$ C_1(n) = \\left. \\frac{dK_n}{ds} \\right|_{s=0} = N \\frac{T}{T+1-T} = NT $$\nFor the second cumulant, $C_2(n)$ (the variance):\n$$ \\frac{d^2K_n}{ds^2} = N \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\frac{T\\exp(s)}{T\\exp(s) + 1 - T} \\right) = N \\frac{(T\\exp(s))(T\\exp(s) + 1 - T) - (T\\exp(s))(T\\exp(s))}{(T\\exp(s) + 1 - T)^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2K_n}{ds^2} = N \\frac{T\\exp(s)(1-T)}{(T\\exp(s) + 1 - T)^2} $$\n$$ C_2(n) = \\left. \\frac{d^2K_n}{ds^2} \\right|_{s=0} = N \\frac{T(1-T)}{(T+1-T)^2} = NT(1-T) $$\nFor the third cumulant, $C_3(n)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^3K_n}{ds^3} = N T(1-T) \\frac{d}{ds} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(s)}{(T\\exp(s) + 1 - T)^2} \\right) $$\nUsing the quotient rule, the derivative of the term in parenthesis is:\n$$ \\frac{\\exp(s)(T\\exp(s) + 1 - T)^2 - \\exp(s) \\cdot 2(T\\exp(s) + 1-T) \\cdot T\\exp(s)}{(T\\exp(s) + 1 - T)^4} = \\frac{(1-T)\\exp(s) - T\\exp(2s)}{(T\\exp(s) + 1 - T)^3} $$\nEvaluating at $s=0$:\n$$ C_3(n) = \\left. \\frac{d^3K_n}{ds^3} \\right|_{s=0} = N T(1-T) \\frac{(1-T) - T}{(T+1-T)^3} = NT(1-T)(1-2T) $$\nNow, we find the cumulants of the transferred charge $Q$ by substituting $N = \\frac{eV\\tau}{h}$ and multiplying by the appropriate power of $e$.\n\nThe second cumulant of charge is:\n$$ C_2(Q) = e^2 C_2(n) = e^2 (NT(1-T)) = e^2 \\left(\\frac{eV\\tau}{h}\\right) T(1-T) = \\frac{e^3 V \\tau T (1-T)}{h} $$\nThe third cumulant of charge is:\n$$ C_3(Q) = e^3 C_3(n) = e^3 (NT(1-T)(1-2T)) = e^3 \\left(\\frac{eV\\tau}{h}\\right) T(1-T)(1-2T) = \\frac{e^4 V \\tau T (1-T)(1-2T)}{h} $$\n\nThe sub-Poissonian nature of the noise is a direct consequence of fermionic statistics, specifically the Pauli exclusion principle. For a classical (Poissonian) process, the charge carriers arrive randomly and independently. The variance of the number of transmitted particles would equal the mean, $\\langle (\\delta n)^2 \\rangle_{\\text{Pois}} = \\langle n \\rangle = NT$. This would yield a shot noise power proportional to the average current, with a Fano factor $F=1$.\n\nIn our fermionic system, the incident stream of electrons is not random. The Pauli principle dictates that electrons occupy distinct quantum states, leading to a perfectly regular and noiseless stream of $N$ electrons arriving in time $\\tau$. The noise is generated solely by the probabilistic partitioning of this quiet stream by the scatterer into transmitted and reflected components. This is known as partition noise. The variance, $C_2(n)=NT(1-T)$, is suppressed relative to the Poissonian value $NT$ by the factor $(1-T)$. The Fano factor is $F = \\frac{C_2(n)}{C_1(n)} = \\frac{NT(1-T)}{NT} = 1-T$. Since $T \\in [0,1]$, we have $F \\leq 1$. For any non-zero transmission ($T>0$) and non-perfect transmission ($T1$), the noise is sub-Poissonian ($F1$). In the limit of a perfectly transmitting channel ($T=1$), the noise vanishes ($F=0$), as the perfectly ordered incident stream remains perfectly ordered upon transmission.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{e^3 V \\tau T (1-T)}{h}  \\frac{e^4 V \\tau T (1-T)(1-2T)}{h} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3015612"}, {"introduction": "Building on the single-channel picture, this exercise demonstrates how to analyze a more realistic mesoscopic conductor with multiple parallel transport channels.

The conductor is at zero temperature ($T=0$) and subject to a small, constant voltage bias $V$, such that the difference in electrochemical potentials between the left and right reservoirs is $\\mu_\\mathrm{L} - \\mu_\\mathrm{R} = eV$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the direct current $I$ flowing through the conductor. According to the Landauer formula, the current contribution from a single transport channel at zero temperature is given by the transmission probability of that channel, $T(E)$, integrated over the energy window defined by the bias voltage. The problem states that there are four orbital channels and that electronic spin is degenerate. This implies a spin-degeneracy factor of $g_s = 2$. Therefore, each orbital channel $n$ with transmission probability $T_n$ supports two independent spin channels (spin-up and spin-down), each with the same transmission probability $T_n$.\n\nThe total current $I$ is the sum of currents through all available channels:\n$$\nI = g_s \\frac{e}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{4} \\int_{\\mu_\\mathrm{R}}^{\\mu_\\mathrm{L}} T_n(E) \\, dE\n$$\nThe transmission probabilities $T_n$ are given as energy-independent over the relevant bias window.

We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived within the Landauer–Büttiker formalism for two-terminal coherent transport at zero temperature.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Total Current $I$**\n\nThe total current $I$ flowing through the conductor under an applied bias voltage $V$ is given by the Landauer formula. Including the spin degeneracy factor of $2$, which is incorporated into the definition of the conductance quantum $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, the current is:\n$$I = \\frac{2e^2}{h} V \\sum_{n} T_n = G_0 V \\sum_{n} T_n$$\nwhere $\\{T_n\\}$ are the transmission eigenvalues of the system's scattering matrix.\n\nFor a system with a large number of channels, the discrete sum can be replaced by a continuous integral over the distribution of transmission eigenvalues, $\\rho(T)$:\n$$I = G_0 V \\int_{0}^{1} T \\rho(T) dT$$\nAs demonstrated in the validation step, the integral $\\int_{0}^{1} T \\rho(T) dT$ evaluates to the dimensionless conductance $g$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{1} T \\rho(T) dT = \\int_{0}^{1} T \\left(\\frac{g}{2}\\frac{1}{T\\sqrt{1-T}}\\right) dT = \\frac{g}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (1-T)^{-1/2} dT = \\frac{g}{2} \\left[-2(1-T)^{1/2}\\right]_{0}^{1} = g$$\nTherefore, the total current is:\n$$I = g G_0 V = g \\left(\\frac{2e^2}{h}\\right) V$$\nThis is the expression for the current in amperes.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Noise Spectral Density $S_I(0)$**\n\nThe zero-frequency current noise spectral density, or shot noise, at zero temperature arises from the statistical partitioning of electrons at the scatterer. The expression for $S_I(0)$ in the Landauer-Büttiker framework, including spin degeneracy, is:\n$$S_I(0) = 2 \\times \\frac{2e^2}{h} |eV| \\sum_{n} T_n(1-T_n) = 2e|V| G_0 \\sum_{n} T_n(1-T_n)$$\nThe term $T_n(1-T_n)$ reflects the binomial nature of the transmission process for each channel.\n\nAgain, we convert the sum to an integral using the distribution $\\rho(T)$:\n$$S_I(0) = 2e|V| G_0 \\int_{0}^{1} T(1-T) \\rho(T) dT$$\nWe now evaluate this integral by substituting the Dorokhov distribution:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{1} T(1-T) \\rho(T) dT = \\int_{0}^{1} T(1-T) \\left(\\frac{g}{2}\\frac{1}{T\\sqrt{1-T}}\\right) dT $$\n$$ = \\frac{g}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{1-T}{\\sqrt{1-T}} dT = \\frac{g}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (1-T)^{1/2} dT $$\nThis integral evaluates as:\n$$ \\frac{g}{2} \\left[-\\frac{2}{3}(1-T)^{3/2}\\right]_{0}^{1} = \\frac{g}{2} \\left(0 - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{g}{3} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $S_I(0)$, we obtain:\n$$S_I(0) = 2e|V| G_0 \\left(\\frac{g}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} g e |V| G_0 = \\frac{2}{3} g e |V| \\left(\\frac{2e^2}{h}\\right) = \\frac{4 g e^3 |V|}{3h}$$\nThis is the expression for the noise spectral density in ampere-squared per hertz.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Fano Factor $F$**\n\nThe Fano factor is defined as the ratio of the shot noise to the noise of a Poissonian process carrying the same average current, $2e|I|$. The problem provides this definition:\n$$F \\equiv \\frac{S_I(0)}{2 e\\,|I|}$$\nWe now substitute the derived expressions for $I$ and $S_I(0)$. We can use the symbolic forms in terms of $g$, $G_0$, and $V$.\nThe magnitude of the current is $|I| = |g G_0 V| = g G_0 |V|$, since $g$ and $G_0$ are positive.\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} g e |V| G_0}{2e (g G_0 |V|)}$$\nAll the parameters $g$, $e$, $|V|$, and $G_0$ cancel out:\n$$F = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} g e |V| G_0}{2 g e |V| G_0} = \\frac{2/3}{2} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis result, $F=1/3$, is the universal value of the Fano factor for a diffusive metallic conductor, independent of its specific length, width, or conductance.\n\nAlternatively, the Fano factor can be computed directly as the ratio of the averaged channel properties:\n$$F = \\frac{\\sum_n T_n(1-T_n)}{\\sum_n T_n} \\longrightarrow \\frac{\\int_0^1 T(1-T) \\rho(T) dT}{\\int_0^1 T \\rho(T) dT}$$\nUsing our previously calculated integrals:\n$$F = \\frac{g/3}{g} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThis confirms the result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$$", "id": "3015598"}]}
