The reservoirs have an isotropic, spherical Fermi surface characterized by the Fermi wavevector $k_{F}$, and the electrons are spin-degenerate. The temperature is effectively zero so that transport is dominated by states at the Fermi energy.

The approach will be to model the system as two resistors in series, calculate the resistance of each component, and sum them. This series addition is justified because the diffusive segment causes inelastic scattering, destroying phase coherence and effectively thermalizing the electrons, which decouples the ballistic and diffusive transport regimes. The total resistance $R_{total}$ is therefore the sum of the contact resistance of the ballistic constriction, $R_c$, and the resistance of the diffusive segment, $R_d$.\n$$\nR_{total} = R_c + R_d\n$$\n\nFirst, we derive the contact resistance $R_c$ of the ballistic constriction. At zero temperature, the Landauer-Büttiker formula for the conductance $G$ of a multi-channel conductor is given by:\n$$\nG = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum_{n=1}^{M} T_n\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, the factor of $2$ accounts for spin degeneracy, $M$ is the total number of available conduction channels (transverse modes), and $T_n$ is the transmission probability of the $n$-th channel. For a ballistic conductor, scattering is absent, so the transmission probability for any open channel is unity ($T_n=1$), while for closed channels it is zero. The formula simplifies to:\n$$\nG_c = \\frac{2e^2}{h} M\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the number of open conduction channels at the Fermi energy. The resistance is the inverse of the conductance:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{1}{G_c} = \\frac{h}{2e^2 M}\n$$\nThe number of channels $M$ is determined by counting the number of transverse modes whose transverse kinetic energy is less than the Fermi energy. In k-space, this corresponds to counting the number of transverse states $(k_x, k_y)$ that satisfy $k_x^2 + k_y^2  k_F^2$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi wavevector. For a large number of channels, we can use a semiclassical approximation. The number of states is the allowed area in transverse k-space, $\\pi k_F^2$, multiplied by the density of states in 2D k-space, $A/(2\\pi)^2$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the constriction. Thus, the number of orbital channels is:\n$$\nM = \\frac{A}{(2\\pi)^2} \\times (\\pi k_F^2) = \\frac{A k_F^2}{4\\pi}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $M$ into the formula for $R_c$, we obtain the Sharvin contact resistance:\n$$\nR_c = \\frac{h}{2e^2} \\left( \\frac{4\\pi}{A k_F^2} \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi h}{e^2 A k_F^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the resistance $R_d$ of the diffusive segment. The problem states that this segment obeys Ohm's law with a bulk resistivity $\\rho$. For a uniform conductor of length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$, the resistance is given by the classical formula:\n$$\nR_d = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}\n$$\n\nThe total two-terminal resistance is the sum of these two components:\n$$\nR_{total} = R_c + R_d = \\frac{2\\pi h}{e^2 A k_F^2} + \\rho \\frac{L}{A}\n$$\n\nWe are now prepared to substitute the given numerical values to find the final answer.

The wire is phase coherent over a length comparable to $L$ (quantum coherent transport), and it is connected to ideal reservoirs at a small bias voltage $V$ in the zero temperature limit $T=0$. In the Landauer-Büttiker picture of mesoscopic transport, the conductance is determined by the set of transmission eigenvalues $\\{T_n\\}$ of the scattering matrix.

For a quasi-one-dimensional conductor in the diffusive limit ($L \\gg l$, where $l$ is the elastic mean free path), the DMPK equation predicts that regardless of the microscopic details of the disorder, the distribution of eigenvalues converges to a unique, scale-invariant stationary form. This universal distribution is precisely the Dorokhov distribution, $\\rho(T) \\propto (T\\sqrt{1-T})^{-1}$, used in the calculation.\n$2$. **Cancellation of System-Specific Parameters**: The derivation shows that the Fano factor is a ratio of average properties of the transmission spectrum. The parameter $g$, the dimensionless conductance, which depends on the specific geometry ($L$, cross-sectional area) and disorder strength ($l$), appears in both the numerator and the denominator of the expression for $F$ and cancels out. The final result depends only on the functional form of the universal distribution $\\rho(T)$, not on the specific value of $g$.\n$3$. **Role of Phase Coherence**: The entire theoretical framework, including the Landauer-Büttiker formulas and the DMPK equation, is predicated on the assumption of phase-coherent transport. Phase coherence means that electrons maintain their quantum-mechanical phase information as they traverse the sample, allowing for interference effects that are captured by the scattering matrix and its transmission eigenvalues. Without phase coherence (i.e., if the phase-coherence length $L_\\phi \\ll L$), the transport becomes classical, the concept of a single scattering matrix for the entire sample is invalid, and shot noise is suppressed, leading to a much smaller Fano factor.\n\nIn summary, the universality of the $F=1/3$ value stems from the universality of the underlying statistical description of electron transport in the phase-coherent diffusive regime, as established by the DMPK theory.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}\n$$", "id": "3004943"}, {"introduction": "To achieve a complete picture of quantum transport, we must go beyond the first two moments (mean current and noise) and consider the full probability distribution of the transferred charge.
