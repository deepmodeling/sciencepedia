This corresponds to an antiferromagnetic coupling, where the spin-singlet ground state is favored over the triplet state.\n\n**Step 4: Dependence of J on t and $\\Delta$**\n\n- **Dependence on $t$**: The exchange coupling $J$ is proportional to $t^2$. This quadratic dependence is characteristic of a superexchange interaction, which is a second-order quantum process involving virtual charge excitations. Stronger tunnel coupling allows more frequent virtual hopping, leading to a stronger effective spin interaction.\n\n- **Dependence on $\\Delta$**: The exchange coupling can be written as $J(\\Delta) = \\frac{4t^2}{U-V} \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{U-V}\\right)^2\\right)^{-1}$. The dependence on detuning $\\Delta$ is symmetric, i.e., $J(\\Delta)=J(-\\Delta)$. The coupling is at its minimum at zero detuning, $\\Delta=0$, where $J(0) = \\frac{4t^2}{U-V}$. As the magnitude of the detuning, $|\\Delta|$, increases from $0$, the denominator $(U-V)^2-\\Delta^2$ decreases. Consequently, $J$ increases as $|\\Delta|$ grows. This occurs because a non-zero detuning lowers the energy barrier to one of the virtual charged states (e.g., if $\\Delta0$, $\\delta E_{(0,2)}$ becomes smaller), enhancing the virtual tunneling process that mediates the exchange interaction. The expression formally diverges as $|\\Delta| \\to U-V$, signaling the breakdown of perturbation theory as the system approaches a charge transition boundary where the ground state changes from $(1,1)$ to either $(2,0)$ or $(0,2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{4t^2(U-V)}{(U-V)^2 - \\Delta^2}}\n$$", "id": "3011838"}]}
