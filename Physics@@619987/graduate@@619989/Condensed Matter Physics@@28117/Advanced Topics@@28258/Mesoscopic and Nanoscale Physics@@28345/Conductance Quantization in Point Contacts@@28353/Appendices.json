The approach will be based on the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism applied to a tight-binding model of the device. The solution proceeds in several steps: ($1$) defining the tight-binding Hamiltonian for the system, ($2$) calculating the lead self-energies to account for the open-system nature of the device, ($3$) computing the full device Green's function, and ($4$) deriving and using an expression for the transmission probability to find the conductance.\n\nThe system is modeled on a two-dimensional square lattice with lattice spacing set to unity. The Hamiltonian is of a nearest-neighbor tight-binding form. For a site indexed by its coordinates $(i_x, i_y)$, where $i_x \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N_x-1\\}$ and $i_y \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N_y-1\\}$, the time-independent Schrödinger equation is:\n$$ (E - V(i_x, i_y))\\psi(i_x, i_y) = -t \\sum_{\\langle(i'_x, i'_y), (i_x, i_y)\\rangle} \\psi(i'_x, i'_y) $$\nHere, $E$ is the energy of the electron, $\\psi(i_x, i_y)$ is its wavefunction amplitude at site $(i_x, i_y)$, $V(i_x, i_y)$ is the on-site potential, and $t$ is the hopping amplitude between nearest neighbors. The summation runs over the four nearest neighbors of site $(i_x, i_y)$. This discrete equation defines an eigenvalue problem, which can be expressed in matrix form as $H\\Psi = E\\Psi$. The Hamiltonian matrix $H$ has diagonal elements $H_{k,k} = V(i_x, i_y)$ for a site $k$ corresponding to $(i_x, i_y)$, and off-diagonal elements $H_{k,k'} = -t$ if sites $k$ and $k'$ are nearest neighbors, and $0$ otherwise. This formulation implicitly uses an energy reference where the center of the conduction band of a vast $2$D lattice (on-site energy of $4t$) is shifted to $0$. The device region has $N_x \\times N_y$ sites, so its Hamiltonian, $H_D$, is a matrix of size $(N_x N_y) \\times (N_x N_y)$.

The effect of the leads is incorporated into the device description through self-energy matrices, $\\Sigma_L^R(E)$ and $\\Sigma_R^R(E)$. The retarded Green's function of the device coupled to the leads is then given by:\n$$ G^R(E) = \\left[ (E+i\\eta)I - H_D - \\Sigma_L^R(E) - \\Sigma_R^R(E) \\right]^{-1} $$\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix and $\\eta$ is a small positive infinitesimal that ensures causality and aids numerical stability.\n\nThe self-energy $\\Sigma_\\alpha^R$ for a lead $\\alpha \\in \\{L, R\\}$ is constructed from the surface Green's function, $g_s^R$, of the corresponding semi-infinite lead. The leads are uniform along the transport direction, allowing them to be described by a block-tridiagonal Hamiltonian with repeating blocks. The intra-slice Hamiltonian block is $H_0$ (an $N_y \\times N_y$ matrix for a transverse slice of the lead) and the inter-slice coupling matrix is $\\tau$ (also $N_y \\times N_y$). The surface Green's function $g_s^R$ satisfies the nonlinear matrix equation:\n$$ g_s^R(E) = \\left[ (E+i\\eta)I - H_0 - \\tau g_s^R(E) \\tau^\\dagger \\right]^{-1} $$\nThis equation is solved using a numerically stable iterative procedure. Starting with an initial guess $g_s^R = 0$, the expression is iterated until convergence. Once $g_s^R$ is found, the self-energy block is calculated as $\\Sigma_{block}^R = \\tau g_s^R \\tau^\\dagger$. For the left lead, this $N_y \\times N_y$ block is placed in the top-left corner of the full $(N_x N_y) \\times (N_x N_y)$ self-energy matrix $\\Sigma_L^R$.

The problem requires deriving the expression for $T(E)$ from the Green's function formalism. The net current flow from one part of a system to another can be related to the system's Green's functions. By calculating the steady-state current flowing into the right lead originating from the left lead, one arrives at the Caroli formula for the transmission function:\n$$ T(E) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\Gamma_R(E) G^R(E) \\Gamma_L(E) G^A(E) \\right] $$\nThe components of this formula are the device Green's functions $G^R$ and $G^A = [G^R]^\\dagger$ (the advanced Green's function), and the lead broadening matrices $\\Gamma_\\alpha(E)$. The broadening matrix for lead $\\alpha$ is defined as:\n$$ \\Gamma_\\alpha(E) = i \\left[ \\Sigma_\\alpha^R(E) - \\Sigma_\\alpha^A(E) \\right] $$\nwhere $\\Sigma_\\alpha^A(E) = [\\Sigma_\\alpha^R(E)]^\\dagger$. The matrix $\\Gamma_\\alpha$ is Hermitian and positive semi-definite, representing the strength of the coupling between the device and lead $\\alpha$, or equivalently, the rate at which electrons can escape the device into that lead.\n\nThe computational algorithm proceeds as follows: for each specified value of $V_0$:\n$1$.
