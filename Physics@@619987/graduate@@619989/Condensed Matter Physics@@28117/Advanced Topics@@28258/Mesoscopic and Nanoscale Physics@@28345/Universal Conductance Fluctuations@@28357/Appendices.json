The term $\\tau_\\phi^{-1}$ acts as a cutoff for long diffusion paths, suppressing interference.\n\nThe variance $\\mathrm{var}(g)$ is found to be proportional to a sum over the eigenmodes of the diffusion operator. A key expression derived from the theory gives $\\mathrm{var}(g) \\propto \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} (Dq^2 + \\tau_{\\phi}^{-1})^{-2}$, where $q$ are the wavevectors of the eigenmodes.

The resulting function depends only on the dimensionless parameters $\\xi_x = L_x/L_\\phi$ and $A_p=L_x/L_y$. Consequently, if the sample size is scaled such that $L_x$ and $L_y$ change proportionally (constant $A_p$) and $L_x/L_\\phi$ is also kept constant, the value of $F_{2\\mathrm{D}}$ must remain invariant.\n\nThe numerical implementation truncates these infinite sums at a sufficiently large cutoff index $N_{\\mathrm{max}}$. For each test case, we compute the set of $F_i$ values for the given sizes and then evaluate the maximum fractional deviation $\\Delta = \\max_i|F_i - \\overline{F}| / \\overline{F}$ to quantify the invariance of $F$. For cases where the scaling holds (Cases $1-4$), $\\Delta$ is expected to be close to zero, limited only by floating-point precision. For Case $5$, where the scaling condition is broken, $\\Delta$ will be significant.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and implements a numerical finite-size scaling analysis for\n    universal conductance fluctuations in 1D and 2D.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Truncation limits for the infinite sums.\n    # Chosen to be large enough for convergence to high precision.\n    N_MAX_1D = 8000\n    N_MAX_2D = 600\n\n    def calc_F_1d(L, L_phi):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the normalized scaling function F for a 1D wire.\n\n        Args:\n            L (float): Length of the wire.\n            L_phi (float): Phase coherence length.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The dimensionless scaling function value F_1D.\n        \"\"\"\n        xi = L / L_phi\n        n = np.arange(1, N_MAX_1D + 1, dtype=np.float64)\n        \n        pi2_n2 = (np.pi * n)**2\n        \n        # Denominator corresponds to the dephasing-free sum (L_phi - infinity)\n        den_sum = np.sum(1.0 / pi2_n2**2)\n        \n        # Numerator is the dephasing-suppressed sum\n        num_sum = np.sum(1.0 / (pi2_n2 + xi**2)**2)\n        \n        return num_sum / den_sum\n\n    def calc_F_2d(Lx, Ly, L_phi):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the normalized scaling function F for a 2D rectangle.\n\n        Args:\n            Lx (float): Length of the rectangle in x-dimension.\n            Ly (float): Length of the rectangle in y-dimension.\n            L_phi (float): Phase coherence length.\n\n        Returns:\n            float: The dimensionless scaling function value F_2D.\n        \"\"\"\n        A_p = Lx / Ly  # Aspect ratio\n        xi_x = Lx / L_phi\n        \n        m_vals = np.arange(0, N_MAX_2D + 1, dtype=np.float64)\n        n_vals = np.arange(0, N_MAX_2D + 1, dtype=np.float64)\n        mm, nn = np.meshgrid(m_vals, n_vals)\n        \n        # Eigenvalue term q^2 without the (pi/L)^2 factor\n        q2_base = mm**2 + (nn * A_p)**2\n        \n        # Handle the (m=0, n=0) mode which leads to division by zero.\n        # We calculate sums over the grid and ensure the (0,0) contribution is zero.\n        q2_base[0, 0] = 1.0  # Temporary value to avoid 0/0 error\n        pi2 = np.pi**2\n\n        # Dephasing-free sum (denominator)\n        den_matrix = 1.0 / (pi2 * q2_base)**2\n        den_matrix[0, 0] = 0.0\n        den_sum = np.sum(den_matrix)\n\n        # Dephasing-suppressed sum (numerator)\n        num_matrix = 1.0 / (pi2 * q2_base + xi_x**2)**2\n        num_matrix[0, 0] = 0.0\n        num_sum = np.sum(num_matrix)\n        \n        return num_sum / den_sum\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1: 1D, L_phi = 1.5 * L\n        {'dim': 1, 'sizes': [30.0, 60.0, 120.0], 'L_phi_rule': lambda L_params: 1.5 * L_params[0]},\n        # Case 2: 1D, L_phi = 10 * L\n        {'dim': 1, 'sizes': [30.0, 60.0, 120.0], 'L_phi_rule': lambda L_params: 10.0 * L_params[0]},\n        # Case 3: 1D, L_phi = 1 * L\n        {'dim': 1, 'sizes': [30.0, 60.0, 120.0], 'L_phi_rule': lambda L_params: 1.0 * L_params[0]},\n        # Case 4: 2D, L_phi = 1.5 * Lx, aspect ratio Lx/Ly = 2\n        {'dim': 2, 'sizes': [(30.0, 15.0), (60.0, 30.0), (120.0, 60.0)], 'L_phi_rule': lambda L_params: 1.5 * L_params[0]},\n        # Case 5: 1D, L_phi = 100 (fixed)\n        {'dim': 1, 'sizes': [30.0, 60.0, 120.0], 'L_phi_rule': lambda L_params: 100.0},\n    ]\n\n    delta_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        F_values = []\n        for size_params in case['sizes']:\n            if case['dim'] == 1:\n                L = size_params\n                L_phi = case['L_phi_rule']((L,))\n                F = calc_F_1d(L, L_phi)\n            else: # dim == 2\n                Lx, Ly = size_params\n                L_phi = case['L_phi_rule']((Lx, Ly))\n                F = calc_F_2d(Lx, Ly, L_phi)\n            F_values.append(F)\n        \n        F_values = np.array(F_values, dtype=np.float64)\n        \n        if len(F_values)  0:\n            F_mean = np.mean(F_values)\n            if F_mean  0:\n                max_abs_dev = np.max(np.abs(F_values - F_mean))\n                delta = max_abs_dev / F_mean\n            else:\n                delta = 0.0 # Should not happen as F  0\n        else:\n            delta = 0.0\n            \n        delta_results.append(delta)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(f'{d:.10e}' for d in delta_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3023353"}]}
