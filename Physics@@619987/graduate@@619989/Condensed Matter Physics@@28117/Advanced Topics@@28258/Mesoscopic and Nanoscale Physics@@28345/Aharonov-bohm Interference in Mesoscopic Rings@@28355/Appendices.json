The integral is the value of the Beta function $B(1+i\\alpha, 1-i\\alpha)$. Using the relation $B(u,v) = \\frac{\\Gamma(u)\\Gamma(v)}{\\Gamma(u+v)}$ and Euler's reflection formula $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$, we can show that $\\Gamma(1+z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi z}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$.\nSetting $z=i\\alpha$, the integral evaluates to:\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{i\\alpha x} \\frac{e^x}{(e^x+1)^2} dx = \\frac{\\Gamma(1+i\\alpha)\\Gamma(1-i\\alpha)}{\\Gamma(2)} = \\frac{\\pi(i\\alpha)}{\\sin(\\pi i\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\pi i\\alpha}{i\\sinh(\\pi\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\pi\\alpha}{\\sinh(\\pi\\alpha)}$$\nThe result is real and positive, so the absolute value is redundant.\n$$S = \\frac{\\pi\\alpha}{\\sinh(\\pi\\alpha)} = \\frac{\\pi \\frac{k_B T \\Delta L}{\\hbar v_F}}{\\sinh\\left(\\pi \\frac{k_B T \\Delta L}{\\hbar v_F}\\right)}$$\nThe problem defines the thermal length as $L_T = \\frac{\\hbar v_F}{\\pi k_B T}$. We substitute this into the expression for $S$:\n$$\\pi \\frac{k_B T}{\\hbar v_F} = \\frac{1}{L_T}$$\nThus, the argument of the sinh function and the numerator become:\n$$\\pi \\frac{k_B T \\Delta L}{\\hbar v_F} = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_T}$$\nThe final expression for the suppression factor is:\n$$S(\\Delta L, L_T) = \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta L}{L_T}}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L}{L_T}\\right)}$$\nThis expression shows that for $T \\to 0$ (i.e., $L_T \\to \\infty$), the argument $\\frac{\\Delta L}{L_T} \\to 0$. Since $\\sinh(x) \\approx x$ for small $x$, $S \\to 1$, indicating no suppression. For high temperatures or large path differences, $\\frac{\\Delta L}{L_T} \\gg 1$, and $S$ decays exponentially, indicating a strong suppression of the interference amplitude.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\frac{\\Delta L}{L_T}}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L}{L_T}\\right)}}$$", "id": "2968753"}]}
