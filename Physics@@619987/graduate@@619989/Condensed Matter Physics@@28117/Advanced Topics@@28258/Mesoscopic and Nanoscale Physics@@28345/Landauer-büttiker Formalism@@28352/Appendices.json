It describes a standard model system in mesoscopic condensed matter physics used to understand quantum transport. The concepts of Landauer-Büttiker formalism, subbands, and internal degeneracies (spin, valley) are fundamental to the field. All assumptions—ballistic transport, zero temperature, linear response, and perfect transmission—are standard idealizations used to elucidate core physical principles. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information for a rigorous derivation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe starting point is the Landauer-Büttiker formula for the electrical current $I$ flowing between two reservoirs through a multi-channel conductor. The net current is given by the integral over energy $E$ of the transmission probability, multiplied by the number of available states and the difference in the occupation probabilities of the reservoirs, which are given by the Fermi-Dirac distribution function $f(E)$. The formula for a single channel is:\n$$I_{\\text{single channel}} = \\frac{e}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} T(E) [f_{L}(E) - f_{R}(E)] dE$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, $T(E)$ is the transmission probability of the channel at energy $E$, and $f_{L}(E)$ and $f_{R}(E)$ are the Fermi-Dirac distributions for the left and right reservoirs, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that for the single subband under consideration, there are internal degrees of freedom leading to degeneracies. The total number of conducting channels, $N$, is the product of the spin degeneracy, $g_{s}$, and the valley degeneracy, $g_{v}$.\n$$N = g_{s} g_{v}$$\nIt is also given that all these $N$ degenerate channels are identical in their transport properties. Therefore, the total current $I$ is the sum of the currents through each individual channel, which simplifies to $N$ times the current of a single channel:\n$$I = N \\left( \\frac{e}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} T(E) [f_{L}(E) - f_{R}(E)] dE \\right)$$\nSubstituting $N = g_s g_v$, we get:\n$$I = g_{s} g_{v} \\frac{e}{h} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} T(E) [f_{L}(E) - f_{R}(E)] dE$$\n\nWe now apply the specific conditions given in the problem.\n1.  **Zero Temperature ($T=0$)**: At zero temperature, the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f(E, \\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\exp((E-\\mu)/k_{B}T)+1}$ becomes a Heaviside step function, $f(E, \\mu) = \\theta(\\mu - E)$.\n    Thus, $f_{L}(E) = \\theta(\\mu_{L} - E)$ and $f_{R}(E) = \\theta(\\mu_{R} - E)$. The difference $[f_{L}(E) - f_{R}(E)]$ is non-zero only in the energy window between the two chemical potentials. Assuming, without loss of generality, that $V>0$ such that $\\mu_{L} > \\mu_{R}$, this difference is:\n    $$f_{L}(E) - f_{R}(E) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } \\mu_{R} < E < \\mu_{L} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n2.  **Perfect Transmission**: The problem states that the subband is perfectly transmitting. This means the transmission probability $T(E)$ for each channel is unity. Since we are in the linear response regime, the energy window $\\mu_{L} - \\mu_{R} = eV$ is small, and we can consider $T(E)=1$ throughout this window.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the expression for the current $I$:\n$$I = g_{s} g_{v} \\frac{e}{h} \\int_{\\mu_{R}}^{\\mu_{L}} (1) \\cdot (1) dE$$\nThe integral is straightforward:\n$$\\int_{\\mu_{R}}^{\\mu_{L}} dE = E \\bigg|_{\\mu_{R}}^{\\mu_{L}} = \\mu_{L} - \\mu_{R}$$\nThe current is then:\n$$I = g_{s} g_{v} \\frac{e}{h} (\\mu_{L} - \\mu_{R})$$\n\nThe problem relates the chemical potential difference to the applied bias voltage $V$ by $\\mu_{L} - \\mu_{R} = eV$. Substituting this into the expression for the current yields:\n$$I = g_{s} g_{v} \\frac{e}{h} (eV) = \\left( g_{s} g_{v} \\frac{e^2}{h} \\right) V$$\n\nThe linear conductance $G$ is defined by Ohm's law in the linear regime, $G = I/V$.\n$$G = \\frac{I}{V} = g_{s} g_{v} \\frac{e^2}{h}$$\nThe quantity $G_{0} = e^{2}/h$ is the fundamental quantum of conductance. The conductance of the single subband is therefore $G = (g_{s} g_{v}) G_{0}$. The degeneracy factor that multiplies the conductance quantum is the product of the spin and valley degeneracies.\n\n**Degeneracy Factor:** $g_{s} g_{v}$\n\n**Discussion on Lifting Degeneracies**\nThe derived result assumes that all $g_s g_v$ channels are degenerate in energy. This degeneracy can be lifted by physical mechanisms that break the underlying symmetries responsible for it. The observability of such lifting in a transport measurement, such as steps in conductance as a function of gate voltage or magnetic field, depends on the energy splitting $\\Delta E$ between the channels being larger than the energy broadening scales, primarily the thermal energy $k_{B}T$. At $T=0$ as specified in the problem, any finite splitting is, in principle, resolvable.\n\n**Lifting Spin Degeneracy ($g_{s}$)**\nSpin degeneracy for charge carriers (typically $g_s=2$) is a direct consequence of time-reversal symmetry. To lift this degeneracy, one must break time-reversal symmetry.\n-   **Mechanism:** The most direct method is the application of an external magnetic field, $\\vec{B}$. This adds a Zeeman term to the Hamiltonian, $H_{Z} = g^{*} \\mu_{B} \\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{B}$, where $g^{*}$ is the effective Landé g-factor of the material, $\\mu_{B}$ is the Bohr magneton, and $\\vec{\\sigma}$ is the vector of Pauli matrices.\n-   **Energy Scale:** This interaction splits the spin-up and spin-down states by an energy $\\Delta E_{\\text{spin}} = g^{*} \\mu_{B} |\\vec{B}|$. If this splitting is resolved, the single conductance step of size $g_v g_s (e^2/h)$ will split into $g_s$ separate steps, each of size $g_v(e^2/h)$ (assuming $g_s$ distinct levels are created). For a typical $g_s=2$ system, one would see two separate plateaus corresponding to conductances of $g_v (e^2/h)$ and $2g_v (e^2/h)$.\n-   **Other Mechanisms:** Spontaneous spin splitting can also occur in ferromagnetic materials due to internal exchange fields or via proximity effect by placing the conductor near a ferromagnet. Strong spin-orbit interaction, combined with a lack of spatial inversion symmetry (as in the Rashba or Dresselhaus effects), also lifts spin degeneracy, but in a more complex, momentum-dependent manner rather than a rigid energy shift of the entire subband.\n\n**Lifting Valley Degeneracy ($g_{v}$)**\nValley degeneracy arises when a material's band structure has multiple equivalent energy minima (valleys) in momentum space, which are related by the crystal's point group symmetries. For example, graphene has two inequivalent valleys ($K$ and $K'$) leading to $g_{v}=2$, and silicon conduction band has six valleys, which can lead to $g_v=2$ in (001)-oriented quantum wells. To lift this degeneracy, one must break the specific crystal symmetry that relates the valleys.\n-   **Mechanisms:** The required mechanism is system-specific.\n    -   **Strain:** Applying uniaxial or shear strain can deform the crystal lattice anisotropically, making the valleys energetically inequivalent.\n    -   **Confinement and Interfaces:** In nanostructures, the specific boundary conditions can lift valley degeneracy. For instance, in graphene nanoribbons, the \"armchair\" edges can couple the valleys, while specific defects or edge disorder can break the symmetry between them. The interaction with a substrate, especially one that breaks the sublattice symmetry of graphene (like hexagonal boron nitride), can also lift the valley degeneracy.\n    -   **Electric Fields:** In systems with a layer degree of freedom, such as bilayer graphene, a perpendicular electric field breaks inversion symmetry and can induce an energy gap, lifting the valley degeneracy.\n    -   **Magnetic Fields:** A magnetic field can also lift valley degeneracy through an orbital effect, distinct from the spin Zeeman effect. This is sometimes described by a \"valley g-factor,\" leading to a valley splitting $\\Delta E_{\\text{valley}}$ proportional to the field strength.\n-   **Energy Scale:** For any of these mechanisms, the resulting energy splitting $\\Delta E_{\\text{valley}}$ must be large enough to be resolved. If both spin and valley degeneracies are fully lifted, one would observe $g_s g_v$ conductance steps, each of height $e^2/h$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{g_v g_s} $$", "id": "2999837"}, {"introduction": "Quantum transport measurements often involve multi-terminal configurations to probe local potentials or to split currents.

This will be accomplished by applying the Landauer-Büttiker (LB) formalism.\n\nThe fundamental principle of the Landauer-Büttiker formalism at zero temperature and in the linear-response regime is that the net electrical current $I_p$ flowing into a reservoir (terminal) $p$ is determined by the voltages $V_q$ of all connected reservoirs and the transmission probabilities $T_{pq}$ between them. For a system where each lead $p$ supports $N_p$ spin-degenerate modes, the current $I_p$ is given by:\n$$\nI_p = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum_{q} \\left( T_{pq} V_q - \\delta_{pq} N_p V_p \\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be derived from considering the flux of electrons between reservoirs, and it inherently satisfies current conservation, $\\sum_p I_p = 0$, provided the scattering matrix is unitary, which implies $\\sum_p T_{pq} = N_q$.

The quantity $T_{\\alpha\\beta}$ is the total transmission probability from contact $\\beta$ to contact $\\alpha$, which is the number of channels from $\\beta$ that reach $\\alpha$. Each contact is an ideal reservoir that absorbs all incoming electrons and re-emits them with an electrochemical potential corresponding to its voltage.\n\nWe can trace the path of the $N$ channels originating from each contact $\\beta$:\n- **From contact 1:** The $N$ channels propagate ideally to contact $2$. Thus, $T_{21} = N$.\n- **From contact 2:** The $N$ channels propagate towards contact $3$ and encounter the scatterer. A fraction $(1-p)$ is transmitted along the edge to contact $3$, so $T_{32} = N(1-p)$. A fraction $p$ tunnels to the other edge segment, which leads to contact $6$. Thus, $T_{62} = Np$.\n- **From contact 3:** The $N$ channels propagate ideally to contact $4$. Thus, $T_{43} = N$.\n- **From contact 4:** The $N$ channels propagate ideally to contact $5$.

Origin of the Longitudinal Voltage Drop**\nThe longitudinal voltage drop between contacts $2$ and $3$ is $V_2 - V_3$. Using the results from the previous step:\n$$V_2 - V_3 = V_1 - \\left( (1-p)V_1 + pV_4 \\right) = pV_1 - pV_4 = p(V_1 - V_4)$$\nSince a net current $I$ flows from contact $1$ to contact $4$, we must have $V_1 > V_4$. Given that the tunneling probability $p > 0$, it directly follows that $V_2 - V_3 > 0$.\n\nConceptually, this voltage drop arises because the scatterer allows for equilibration between edge channels at different electrochemical potentials. The edge channels arriving at contact $3$ are a mixture of those originating from contact $2$ (at potential $V_2=V_1$) and those originating from contact $5$ (at potential $V_5=V_4$), which have tunneled across. Since $V_1 > V_4$, the potential at contact $3$, which is a weighted average of $V_1$ and $V_4$, is necessarily lower than $V_1$. Thus, $V_3  V_2$, resulting in a non-zero longitudinal voltage drop and associated dissipation.\n\n**4. Calculation of Longitudinal Resistance $R_{xx}$**\nTo find $R_{xx} = \\frac{V_2 - V_3}{I}$, we need to relate the potential difference $V_1 - V_4$ to the current $I$. We use the LB relations for contacts $1$ and $4$, where $I_1=I$ and $I_4=-I$.\n\nUsing the equation for $I_1$:\n$$I = \\frac{e^2}{h} (N V_1 - T_{16} V_6) = \\frac{e^2}{h} (N V_1 - N V_6) = \\frac{Ne^2}{h} (V_1 - V_6)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_6$:\n$$I = \\frac{Ne^2}{h} \\left( V_1 - [pV_1 + (1-p)V_4] \\right) = \\frac{Ne^2}{h} \\left( (1-p)V_1 - (1-p)V_4 \\right)$$\n$$I = \\frac{Ne^2}{h} (1-p) (V_1-V_4)$$\n(One can verify this result using the equation for $I_4=-I$, which yields the same expression for $I$).\n\nNow we can calculate $R_{xx}$:\n$$R_{xx} = \\frac{V_2 - V_3}{I} = \\frac{p(V_1 - V_4)}{\\frac{Ne^2}{h} (1-p) (V_1 - V_4)} = \\frac{p}{\\frac{Ne^2}{h}(1-p)}$$\n$$R_{xx} = \\frac{h}{e^2} \\frac{p}{N(1-p)}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to leading order in $p$, where $0  p \\ll 1$. We expand the term $(1-p)^{-1}$ as a geometric series: $(1-p)^{-1} = 1 + p + p^2 + \\dots$.\n$$R_{xx} = \\frac{h}{e^2} \\frac{p}{N} (1 + p + p^2 + \\dots) = \\frac{h}{e^2} \\left( \\frac{p}{N} + \\frac{p^2}{N} + \\dots \\right)$$\nDiscarding terms of order $p^2$ and higher, we obtain the leading-order result:\n$$R_{xx} = \\frac{h}{e^2} \\frac{p}{N}$$\nThe final answer is required in units of $h/e^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{p}{N}}\n$$", "id": "2999795"}]}
