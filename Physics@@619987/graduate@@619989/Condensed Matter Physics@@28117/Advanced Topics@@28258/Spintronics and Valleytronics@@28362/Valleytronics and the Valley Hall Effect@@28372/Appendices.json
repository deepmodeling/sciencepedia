The conduction band is $E_{+}(\\mathbf{k})$. The minima of the conduction band energy occur where $|f(\\mathbf{k})|^2$ is minimized. Since $|f(\\mathbf{k})|^2 \\ge 0$, the absolute minima are located at the momenta $\\mathbf{k}$ where $f(\\mathbf{k}) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we must locate these band minima by solving $f(\\mathbf{k}) = 0$. The structure factor is given as\n$$f(\\mathbf{k}) = t \\left[ 1 + \\exp \\left( i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{1} \\right) + \\exp \\left( i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2} \\right) \\right].$$\nFor $f(\\mathbf{k})$ to be zero, the three complex numbers in the sum, $1$, $\\exp(i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{1})$, and $\\exp(i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2})$, must form a closed triangle on the complex plane. As they all have unit magnitude, they must be equal to $1$, $e^{i 2\\pi/3}$, and $e^{i 4\\pi/3}$ in some order. This leads to two distinct conditions (up to integer multiples of $2\\pi$):\n1. $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} + 2\\pi n_1$ and $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} + 2\\pi n_2$\n2. $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{1} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} + 2\\pi n_1$ and $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} + 2\\pi n_2$\n\nwhere $n_1, n_2$ are integers. Let $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y)$. Using the given primitive vectors $\\mathbf{a}_{1} = a (1, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2} = a ( \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} )$, the dot products are $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{1} = k_x a$ and $\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_{2} = \\frac{k_x a}{2} + \\frac{k_y \\sqrt{3} a}{2}$.\n\nFor case 1, we solve the system:\n$$k_x a = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\implies k_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{3a}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\frac{k_y \\sqrt{3} a}{2} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\implies \\frac{\\pi}{3} + \\frac{k_y \\sqrt{3} a}{2} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\implies k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a}.$$\nThis gives the point $\\mathbf{K} = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{3a}, \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a} \\right)$.\n\nFor case 2, we solve:\n$$k_x a = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\implies k_x = \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\frac{k_y \\sqrt{3} a}{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\implies \\frac{2\\pi}{3} + \\frac{k_y \\sqrt{3} a}{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\implies k_y = 0.$$\nThis gives the point $\\mathbf{K'} = \\left( \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}, 0 \\right)$.\n\nThese two points, $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K'}$, are the fundamental locations of the conduction band minima. All other solutions for $n_1, n_2 \\neq 0$ correspond to these two points shifted by a reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G} = m_1 \\mathbf{b}_1 + m_2 \\mathbf{b}_2$.\nIndeed, $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K'}$ are two of the six corners of the hexagonal first BZ. The six corners are given by $\\pm \\frac{1}{3}(2\\mathbf{b}_1+\\mathbf{b}_2)$, $\\pm \\frac{1}{3}(\\mathbf{b}_1+2\\mathbf{b}_2)$, $\\pm \\frac{1}{3}(\\mathbf{b}_1-\\mathbf{b}_2)$.

For instance, $-\\mathbf{K'} = (-\\frac{4\\pi}{3a}, 0)$ is equivalent to $\\mathbf{K}$ because $-\\mathbf{K'} + \\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\mathbf{K}$. Also, $\\mathbf{K'} = -\\mathbf{K} + \\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2$, so we can state that $\\mathbf{K'} \\equiv -\\mathbf{K} \\pmod{\\mathbf{G}}$. This means the two valleys are related by time-reversal symmetry, since $E(\\mathbf{k})=E(-\\mathbf{k})$.\n\nNext, we must classify these two minima, $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K'}$, according to the problem's definition of equivalence. Two minima are equivalent if they are related by a proper (orientation-preserving) point-group operation of the crystal, combined with a reciprocal lattice translation. They are inequivalent if related only by orientation-reversing operations or time-reversal symmetry.\n\nThe crystal is a honeycomb lattice with a staggered potential $\\Delta$. This potential breaks the inversion symmetry that swaps the two sublattices. The point group of the pristine honeycomb lattice (graphene, $\\Delta=0$) is $D_{6h}$. The staggered potential reduces this to $D_{3h}$.\nWe need the group of proper (orientation-preserving) operations of $D_{3h}$. This is the group $D_3 = \\{E, C_3, C_3^2, C_2', C_2'', C_2'''\\}$. However, in a 2D system, the $C_2'$ rotations about axes lying in the plane act as reflections through a line, which are orientation-reversing. Thus, the group of orientation-preserving point group operations is $C_3 = \\{E, C_3, C_3^2\\}$, which describes rotations by $0$, $2\\pi/3$, and $4\\pi/3$ about the center of a hexagon ($\\Gamma$ point).\n\nWe must now check if $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K'}$ are related by an operation in $C_3$.\nThe rotation matrices for $C_3$ and $C_3^2$ are:\n$$R(C_3) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(2\\pi/3) & -\\sin(2\\pi/3) \\\\ \\sin(2\\pi/3) & \\cos(2\\pi/3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & -\\sqrt{3}/2 \\\\ \\sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$R(C_3^2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(4\\pi/3) & -\\sin(4\\pi/3) \\\\ \\sin(4\\pi/3) & \\cos(4\\pi/3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & \\sqrt{3}/2 \\\\ -\\sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nLet's apply $C_3$ to $\\mathbf{K'}$:\n$$C_3(\\mathbf{K'}) = R(C_3) \\begin{pmatrix} 4\\pi/(3a) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2\\pi/(3a) \\\\ 2\\pi\\sqrt{3}/(3a) \\end{pmatrix} = \\left( -\\frac{2\\pi}{3a}, \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a} \\right).$$\nThis resulting vector is another corner of the BZ. Let's call it $\\mathbf{V}_3$. Is $\\mathbf{V}_3$ equivalent to $\\mathbf{K}$?\n$\\mathbf{K} - \\mathbf{V}_3 = (\\frac{2\\pi}{3a} - (-\\frac{2\\pi}{3a}), \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a} - \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a}) = (\\frac{4\\pi}{3a}, 0) = \\mathbf{K'}$. This is not a reciprocal lattice vector. So $C_3(\\mathbf{K'}) \\not\\equiv \\mathbf{K}$.\n\nIs $C_3(\\mathbf{K'})$ equivalent to $\\mathbf{K'}$ itself?\n$\\mathbf{K'} - C_3(\\mathbf{K'}) = (\\frac{4\\pi}{3a} - (-\\frac{2\\pi}{3a}), 0 - \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a}) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, -\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a}) = \\mathbf{b}_1$.\nSince $\\mathbf{K'} - C_3(\\mathbf{K'}) = \\mathbf{b}_1$, a reciprocal lattice vector, we have $C_3(\\mathbf{K'}) \\equiv \\mathbf{K'} \\pmod{\\mathbf{G}}$. This means the little group of the $\\mathbf{K'}$ valley contains $C_3$.\n\nSimilarly, let's apply $C_3$ to $\\mathbf{K}$:\n$$C_3(\\mathbf{K}) = R(C_3) \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\pi/(3a) \\\\ 2\\pi/(\\sqrt{3}a) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\pi/(3a) - \\pi/a \\\\ \\pi/(\\sqrt{3}a) - \\pi/(\\sqrt{3}a) \\end{pmatrix} = \\left( -\\frac{4\\pi}{3a}, 0 \\right).$$\nThis resultant vector is $-\\mathbf{K'}$. We can verify that $-\\mathbf{K'} \\equiv \\mathbf{K} \\pmod{\\mathbf{G}}$.\n$\\mathbf{K} - (-\\mathbf{K'}) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{3a} + \\frac{4\\pi}{3a}, \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a}) = (\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a})$.\nWe check if this is a reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G} = m_1 \\mathbf{b}_1 + m_2 \\mathbf{b}_2$:\n$\\mathbf{G} = m_1(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}, -\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a}) + m_2(0, \\frac{4\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a}) = (\\frac{2\\pi m_1}{a}, \\frac{2\\pi(-m_1+2m_2)}{\\sqrt{3}a})$.\nComparing components, we need $m_1=1$. The second component becomes $\\frac{2\\pi(-1+2m_2)}{\\sqrt{3}a}$. We need this to equal $\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{3}a}$, so $-1+2m_2=1$, which gives $m_2=1$.\nThus, $\\mathbf{K} - (-\\mathbf{K'}) = \\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2$. This means $C_3(\\mathbf{K}) = -\\mathbf{K'} \\equiv \\mathbf{K} \\pmod{\\mathbf{G}}$.\nSo, the little group of the $\\mathbf{K}$ valley also contains $C_3$.\n\nThe proper point group $C_3$ maps the $\\mathbf{K}$ valley to itself (modulo $\\mathbf{G}$) and the $\\mathbf{K'}$ valley to itself (modulo $\\mathbf{G}$). No operation in $C_3$ transforms the $\\mathbf{K}$ valley into the $\\mathbf{K'}$ valley. Therefore, the two valleys $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K'}$ form two distinct orbits under the action of the proper point group.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, they are inequivalent.\nThe problem explicitly states that valleys related by time-reversal are considered inequivalent. As shown earlier, $\\mathbf{K'} \\equiv -\\mathbf{K}$, so they are related by time reversal, which confirms their inequivalence.\nSince there are two such inequivalent valleys, the valley index $g_v$ is $2$.\nThis corresponds to the two distinct \"valleys\" in materials like gapped graphene or monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides, which form the basis of valleytronics.\nThe calculation is independent of the specific values of $t$ and $\\Delta$, provided $\\Delta \\neq 0$ to define the crystal symmetry and create the band gap.\n\nThe set of all conduction band minima can be partitioned into two sets, which are the orbits under the group of translations by $\\mathbf{G}$. These two sets are represented by $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K'}$.\nThe further classification according to the problem's definition depends on the action of proper point group operations. Since no proper rotation maps $\\mathbf{K}$ to $\\mathbf{K'}$, they are inequivalent.\nThe valley index $g_v$ is the number of these inequivalent classes. There are two.\nFinal answer is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3023721"}, {"introduction": "Once valleys are defined, their most profound consequence is the Valley Hall Effect, which gives rise to topologically protected edge conduction channels.

This means the system has a total of two right-moving modes and two left-moving modes.

Assume spatially uniform excitation, a single exciton species, and that all rates and $G$ are time-independent.\n\nStarting from conservation of exciton number in each valley and the definitions of the rates $G$, $\\Gamma$, and $\\gamma_{v}$, write down the coupled rate equations for $n_{K}(t)$ and $n_{K'}(t)$, determine the steady-state densities $n_{K}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}$ and $n_{K'}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}$ under continuous pumping, and then compute the steady-state valley polarization\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\equiv \\frac{n_{K}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} - n_{K'}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}}{n_{K}^{(\\mathrm{ss})} + n_{K'}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}}.\n$$\nExpress your final answer for $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\Gamma$ and $\\gamma_{v}$. The valley polarization is dimensionless; report it as a dimensionless quantity. Do not perform any numerical substitutions. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The first step is to establish the coupled rate equations for the exciton densities $n_{K}(t)$ and $n_{K'}(t)$ based on the principle of particle number conservation in each valley.\n\nFor valley $K$, the rate of change of the exciton density, $\\frac{dn_{K}}{dt}$, is determined by three processes:\n1.  **Generation**: Excitons are generated at a constant rate $G$. This is a source term, $+G$.\n2.  **Recombination**: Excitons recombine at a rate proportional to their density, $-\\Gamma n_{K}$. This is a loss term.\n3.  **Intervalley Scattering**: Excitons scatter out of valley $K$ into valley $K'$ at a rate $-\\gamma_{v} n_{K}$. Simultaneously, excitons scatter from valley $K'$ into valley $K$ at a rate $+\\gamma_{v} n_{K'}$.\n\nCombining these terms, the rate equation for $n_{K}(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_{K}}{dt} = G - \\Gamma n_{K} - \\gamma_{v} n_{K} + \\gamma_{v} n_{K'}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dn_{K}}{dt} = G - (\\Gamma + \\gamma_{v}) n_{K} + \\gamma_{v} n_{K'}\n$$\n\nFor valley $K'$, the rate of change of the exciton density, $\\frac{dn_{K'}}{dt}$, is determined by similar processes, but with no direct generation term:\n1.  **Generation**: The generation rate is negligible, so it is $0$.\n2.  **Recombination**: Excitons recombine at a rate $-\\Gamma n_{K'}$.\n3.  **Intervalley Scattering**: Excitons scatter out of valley $K'$ into valley $K$ at a rate $-\\gamma_{v} n_{K'}$. Simultaneously, excitons scatter from valley $K$ into valley $K'$ at a rate $+\\gamma_{v} n_{K}$.\n\nThe rate equation for $n_{K'}(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_{K'}}{dt} = -\\Gamma n_{K'} - \\gamma_{v} n_{K'} + \\gamma_{v} n_{K}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dn_{K'}}{dt} = \\gamma_{v} n_{K} - (\\Gamma + \\gamma_{v}) n_{K'}\n$$\n\nNext, we find the steady-state densities, denoted by $n_{K}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}$ and $n_{K'}^{(\\mathrm{ss})}$. In steady state, the densities are constant, so the time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{dn_{K}}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dn_{K'}}{dt} = 0$.
