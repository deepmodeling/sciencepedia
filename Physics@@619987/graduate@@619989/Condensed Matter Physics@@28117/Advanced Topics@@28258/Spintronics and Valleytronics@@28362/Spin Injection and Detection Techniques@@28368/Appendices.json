The physical model is based on the Meservey-Tedrow technique, which relies on the Zeeman splitting of the superconductor's density of states. The solution will be developed from first principles as outlined.\n\nFirst, we define the spin-resolved quasiparticle density of states (DOS) of the superconductor. The standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) DOS for an ideal superconductor is given by $\\rho_{BCS}(E) \\propto |E| / \\sqrt{E^2 - \\Delta^2}$ for energies $|E| > \\Delta$ and is zero inside the gap $|E| < \\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the superconducting energy gap. To account for lifetime effects and ensure numerical stability, a Dynes broadening parameter $\\Gamma$ is introduced by replacing the energy $E$ with a complex energy. A common, particle-hole symmetric form for the broadened DOS is:\n$$ \\rho(E, \\Delta, \\Gamma) = \\mathrm{Re}\\left[ \\frac{|E - i\\Gamma|}{\\sqrt{(E - i\\Gamma)^2 - \\Delta^2}} \\right] $$\nwhere the constant of proportionality related to the normal state DOS is taken as unity, as it will cancel out in the normalized conductance. In a magnetic field, the Zeeman effect lifts the spin degeneracy. The energies for spin-up ($\\uparrow$) and spin-down ($\\downarrow$) quasiparticles are shifted by $\\mp \\Delta_Z/2$ respectively, where $\\Delta_Z$ is the Zeeman splitting energy. The spin-resolved DOS are thus given by:\n$$ \\rho_{\\uparrow}(E) = \\rho(E - \\Delta_Z/2, \\Delta, \\Gamma) $$\n$$ \\rho_{\\downarrow}(E) = \\rho(E + \\Delta_Z/2, \\Delta, \\Gamma) $$\n\nAccording to Fermi's Golden Rule, the tunneling current at a bias voltage $V$ is proportional to the integral of the spectral function available for tunneling, weighted by the occupation probabilities. The total spectral function, $N(E, P)$, is a weighted sum of the spin-resolved DOS, with weights determined by the spin polarization $P$ of the ferromagnetic electrode:\n$$ N(E, P) = w_{\\uparrow} \\rho_{\\uparrow}(E) + w_{\\downarrow} \\rho_{\\downarrow}(E) = \\frac{1+P}{2} \\rho_{\\uparrow}(E) + \\frac{1-P}{2} \\rho_{\\downarrow}(E) $$\nThe differential conductance, $G(V) = dI/dV$, at a finite temperature $T$ is obtained by convolving the spectral function $N(E, P)$ with the thermal broadening kernel $K_T(E)$, which is the negative derivative of the Fermi-Dirac distribution $f_{FD}(E) = (1 + e^{E/k_B T})^{-1}$:\n$$ G(V) \\propto \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} N(E', P) \\left( -\\frac{\\partial f_{FD}(eV - E')}{\\partial(eV)} \\right) dE' $$\nThe kernel is $K_T(E) = -\\frac{\\partial f_{FD}(E)}{\\partial E} = \\frac{1}{4k_B T} \\mathrm{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{E}{2k_B T}\\right)$. This kernel is normalized such that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} K_T(E) dE = 1$.

We can rewrite the spectral function as:\n$$ N(E, P) = \\left[ \\frac{\\rho_{\\uparrow}(E) + \\rho_{\\downarrow}(E)}{2} \\right] + P \\left[ \\frac{\\rho_{\\uparrow}(E) - \\rho_{\\downarrow}(E)}{2} \\right] $$\nLet $N_A(E) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\rho_{\\uparrow}(E) + \\rho_{\\downarrow}(E))$ be the polarization-independent part and $N_B(E) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\rho_{\\uparrow}(E) - \\rho_{\\downarrow}(E))$ be the polarization-dependent basis function. Due to the linearity of the convolution, the conductance can also be written in a linear form:\n$$ G(V, P) = G_A(V) + P \\cdot G_B(V) $$\nwhere $G_A(V) = (N_A * K_T)(V)$ and $G_B(V) = (N_B * K_T)(V)$. Given a measured conductance curve $G_{meas}(V)$, we can estimate $P$ by minimizing the mean-squared error $\\chi^2 = \\sum_i [G_{meas}(V_i) - G(V_i, P)]^2$ over a discrete set of voltage points $V_i$. Setting the derivative $\\partial \\chi^2 / \\partial P$ to zero yields the least-squares estimator for $P$:\n$$ P_{est} = \\frac{\\sum_i (G_{meas}(V_i) - G_A(V_i)) G_B(V_i)}{\\sum_i G_B(V_i)^2} = \\frac{(\\vec{G}_{meas} - \\vec{G}_A) \\cdot \\vec{G}_B}{\\vec{G}_B \\cdot \\vec{G}_B} $$\nwhere the vectors represent the functions evaluated on the voltage grid. If the Zeeman splitting $\\Delta_Z = 0$, then $\\rho_{\\uparrow}(E) = \\rho_{\\downarrow}(E)$. This causes $N_B(E)$ and consequently $G_B(V)$ to vanish identically. In this case, the polarization information is lost, and the denominator of the estimator becomes zero. The physically correct result is $P=0$, which our algorithm must enforce.\n\nThe numerical implementation proceeds as follows. First, a sufficiently fine and wide numerical grid for energy and voltage is established. The spin-resolved DOS and the thermal kernel are computed on this grid. The convolutions to obtain $G_{meas}(V)$ (from $P_{true}$), $G_A(V)$, and $G_B(V)$ are performed efficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) via `scipy.signal.fftconvolve`. Finally, the derived estimator formula is applied to the generated $G_{meas}(V)$ to calculate $P_{est}$ for each provided test case.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.signal import fftconvolve\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates spin-polarized tunneling and extracts ferromagnet spin polarization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Boltzmann constant in meV/K\n    KB_MEV_K = 0.08617333\n\n    def bcs_dos(E, delta, gamma):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the Dynes-broadened, particle-hole symmetric BCS density of states.\n        \n        Args:\n            E (np.ndarray): Energy grid in meV.\n            delta (float): Superconducting gap in meV.\n            gamma (float): Dynes broadening parameter in meV.\n            \n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: The normalized density of states.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Complex energy E' = E - i*gamma\n        E_complex = E - 1j * gamma\n        \n        # Term inside the square root: (E')^2 - delta^2\n        sqrt_arg = E_complex**2 - delta**2\n        \n        # DOS is Re[|E'| / sqrt((E')^2 - delta^2)]\n        dos = np.real(np.abs(E_complex) / np.sqrt(sqrt_arg))\n        \n        return dos\n\n    def compute_conductance(V_grid, delta, delta_z, T, P, gamma):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes the differential conductance G(V) for a F-I-S junction.\n        \n        Args:\n            V_grid (np.ndarray): Bias voltage grid in mV.\n            delta (float): Superconducting gap in meV.\n            delta_z (float): Zeeman splitting in meV.\n            T (float): Temperature in K.\n            P (float): Spin polarization.\n            gamma (float): Dynes broadening in meV.\n            \n        Returns:\n            np.ndarray: The simulated differential conductance G(V).\n        \"\"\"\n        # Energy grid is identical to voltage grid based on problem spec (eV -> V)\n        E_grid = V_grid\n        dE = E_grid[1] - E_grid[0]\n        \n        # 1.
