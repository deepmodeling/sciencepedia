We will proceed to derive and solve the governing equation for the steady-state spin accumulation $\\mu_{s}(x)$.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental relations provided:\n1.  The spin continuity equation, which describes the conservation of spin angular momentum:\n    $$ \\partial_{t} s + \\partial_{x} j_{s} = - \\frac{s}{\\tau_{s}} $$\n    Here, $s(x,t)$ is the spin density difference, $j_{s}(x,t)$ is the spin current density, $\\tau_{s}$ is the spin relaxation time, and the term $-s/\\tau_{s}$ represents the rate of spin relaxation (a sink term). The partial derivatives are denoted by $\\partial_{t}$ and $\\partial_{x}$ for time and space, respectively.\n\n2.  Fick's first law for spin diffusion, which relates the spin current to the gradient of the spin density:\n    $$ j_{s} = - D_{s} \\partial_{x} s $$\n    where $D_{s}$ is the spin diffusion constant.\n\n3.  The linear relationship between spin accumulation $\\mu_{s}$ and spin density $s$:\n    $$ \\mu_{s} = \\kappa s $$\n    where $\\kappa$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state solution. In steady state, all time derivatives vanish. Therefore, $\\partial_{t} s = 0$. Applying this condition to the spin continuity equation gives:\n$$ \\partial_{x} j_{s} = - \\frac{s}{\\tau_{s}} $$\nSince we are now only concerned with spatial variation, the partial derivative $\\partial_{x}$ can be written as a total derivative $\\frac{d}{dx}$.\n$$ \\frac{d j_{s}}{dx} = - \\frac{s}{\\tau_{s}} $$\nNext, we substitute Fick's law into this steady-state continuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( - D_{s} \\frac{ds}{dx} \\right) = - \\frac{s}{\\tau_{s}} $$\nThe problem states that the spin diffusion constant $D_{s}$ is uniform. Therefore, it can be taken out of the derivative:\n$$ - D_{s} \\frac{d^2 s}{dx^2} = - \\frac{s}{\\tau_{s}} $$\nThis simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation for the spin density $s(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 s}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{D_{s}\\tau_{s}} s $$\nThe problem requires an expression for the spin accumulation $\\mu_{s}(x)$. We use the relation $\\mu_{s} = \\kappa s$, which, given that $\\kappa$ is a constant, implies $s = \\mu_{s}/\\kappa$. Substituting this into the differential equation for $s(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{s}}{\\kappa} \\right) = \\frac{1}{D_{s}\\tau_{s}} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{s}}{\\kappa} \\right) $$\nAgain, since $\\kappa$ is a constant, we have:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\frac{d^2 \\mu_{s}}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\frac{\\mu_{s}}{D_{s}\\tau_{s}} $$\nMultiplying by $\\kappa$ yields the governing equation for the steady-state spin accumulation $\\mu_{s}(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\mu_{s}}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{D_{s}\\tau_{s}} \\mu_{s} $$\nThe problem defines the spin diffusion length as $\\lambda_{s} = \\sqrt{D_{s}\\tau_{s}}$. Using this definition, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\mu_{s}}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{s}^2} \\mu_{s} = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - 1/\\lambda_{s}^2 = 0$, which has roots $r_{1,2} = \\pm 1/\\lambda_{s}$. The general solution is therefore:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) + B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  At $x=0$, there is a spin injection such that $\\mu_{s}(0) = \\mu_{0}$.\n2.  As $x \\to \\infty$, the spin accumulation must remain physically realistic, i.e., $|\\mu_{s}(x)|$ remains finite.\n\nWe apply the second boundary condition first. The spin diffusion length $\\lambda_{s} = \\sqrt{D_{s}\\tau_{s}}$ is a positive real number. As $x \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp(x/\\lambda_{s})$ diverges. For $\\mu_{s}(x)$ to remain finite, its coefficient must be zero. Thus, we must have $A=0$.\nThis simplifies the solution to:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) $$\nNow, we apply the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(0) = \\mu_{0} $$\nSubstituting $x=0$ into our simplified solution:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(0) = B \\exp(0) = B \\cdot 1 = B $$\nEquating the two gives $B = \\mu_{0}$.\n\nSubstituting the value of $B$ back into the solution, we obtain the final expression for the steady-state spin accumulation profile:\n$$ \\mu_{s}(x) = \\mu_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right) $$\nThis result shows that the spin accumulation injected at the boundary decays exponentially into the wire, with a characteristic decay length equal to the spin diffusion length $\\lambda_{s}$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\mu_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{s}}\\right)} $$", "id": "3017633"}, {"introduction": "While spin relaxation presents a major challenge, the quantum mechanical nature of the electron's environment can be engineered to protect spin information.
