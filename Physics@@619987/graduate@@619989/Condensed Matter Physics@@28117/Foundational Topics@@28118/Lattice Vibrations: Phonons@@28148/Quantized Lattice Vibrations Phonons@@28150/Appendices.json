We begin by establishing the equation of motion for an arbitrary mass in the chain.\n\nThe system consists of point masses $m$ at equilibrium positions $x_n = na$, where $n$ is an integer and $a$ is the lattice constant. Let $u_n(t)$ be the longitudinal displacement of the $n$-th mass from its equilibrium position. The force on the $n$-th mass arises from the stretching or compression of the harmonic springs connecting it to its nearest neighbors, the $(n-1)$-th and $(n+1)$-th masses.\n\nThe force exerted on mass $n$ by mass $n+1$ is $F_{n \\leftarrow n+1} = K(u_{n+1} - u_n)$.\nThe force exerted on mass $n$ by mass $n-1$ is $F_{n \\leftarrow n-1} = K(u_{n-1} - u_n)$.\n\nThe net force on the $n$-th mass, $F_n$, is the sum of these two forces:\n$$ F_n = K(u_{n+1} - u_n) + K(u_{n-1} - u_n) = K(u_{n+1} + u_{n-1} - 2u_n) $$\nThis force can also be derived from the total potential energy $V = \\sum_j \\frac{K}{2}(u_{j+1}-u_j)^2$.

We use the trial solution form provided:\n$$ u_n(t) = U \\exp(i(kna - \\omega t)) $$\nwhere $U$ is the amplitude, $k$ is the wavevector, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. We substitute this solution into the equation of motion. First, we compute the necessary derivatives and shifted terms:\nThe second time derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u_n}{dt^2} = (-i\\omega)^2 U \\exp(i(kna - \\omega t)) = -\\omega^2 u_n(t) $$\nThe displacements of the neighboring masses are:\n$$ u_{n+1}(t) = U \\exp(i(k(n+1)a - \\omega t)) = U \\exp(i(kna - \\omega t)) \\exp(ika) = u_n(t) \\exp(ika) $$\n$$ u_{n-1}(t) = U \\exp(i(k(n-1)a - \\omega t)) = U \\exp(i(kna - \\omega t)) \\exp(-ika) = u_n(t) \\exp(-ika) $$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation of motion:\n$$ m(-\\omega^2 u_n) = K(u_n \\exp(ika) + u_n \\exp(-ika) - 2u_n) $$\nSince $u_n(t)$ is not trivially zero for all $n$ and $t$, we can divide the entire equation by $u_n$:\n$$ -m\\omega^2 = K(\\exp(ika) + \\exp(-ika) - 2) $$\nUsing Euler's identity, $\\exp(i\\theta) + \\exp(-i\\theta) = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we can simplify the term in the parenthesis:\n$$ -m\\omega^2 = K(2\\cos(ka) - 2) = -2K(1 - \\cos(ka)) $$\nTo simplify further, we use the trigonometric half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n$$ m\\omega^2 = 2K \\left( 2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right) \\right) = 4K \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{ka}{2}\\right) $$\nSolving for $\\omega$ yields the dispersion relation for the normal modes.

This limit corresponds to wavelengths $\\lambda$ much larger than the lattice spacing $a$, which in terms of the wavevector $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$, means $|k|a \\ll 1$.\nIn this limit, the argument of the sine function, $\\frac{ka}{2}$, is very small. We can therefore use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(x) \\approx x$ for small $|x|$.\nApplying this to our dispersion relation:\n$$ \\omega(k) \\approx 2\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} \\left| \\frac{ka}{2} \\right| = a\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{m}} |k| $$\nThis linear relationship $\\omega(k) = c_s |k|$ is characteristic of acoustic waves, where $c_s$ is the speed of sound.\n\nThe problem specifically asks to identify $c_s$ as the slope $\\frac{d\\omega}{dk}$ at $k=0$. This is the group velocity $v_g = \\frac{d\\omega}{dk}$ in the long-wavelength limit. We compute this from the full dispersion relation. For wavevectors near $k=0$ (and within the first Brillouin zone), we can drop the absolute value, as $\\sin(ka/2)$ will have the same sign as $k$.

The internal energy per unit volume becomes $U/V \\propto T^4$, and the specific heat per unit volume becomes $C_V/V \\propto T^3$ (the Debye $T^3$ law).
