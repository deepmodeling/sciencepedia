It represents a canonical problem in introductory condensed matter physics. Therefore, it is valid, and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe system is a one-dimensional chain of $N$ identical masses $M$ separated by a lattice constant $a$. The displacement of the $n$-th mass from its equilibrium position $x_n = na$ is denoted by $u_n(t)$. The masses are connected by harmonic springs of force constant $K$, and we consider only nearest-neighbor interactions.\n\nThe force $F_n$ on the $n$-th mass is given by Hooke's law, considering the relative displacements of its neighbors:\n$$\nF_n = K(u_{n+1} - u_n) - K(u_n - u_{n-1}) = K(u_{n+1} - 2u_n + u_{n-1})\n$$\nApplying Newton's second law, $F_n = M\\ddot{u}_n$, the equation of motion for the $n$-th mass is:\n$$\nM\\frac{d^2u_n}{dt^2} = K(u_{n+1} - 2u_n + u_{n-1})\n$$\nWe seek normal-mode solutions in the form of traveling waves:\n$$\nu_n(t) = A \\exp[i(kx_n - \\omega t)] = A \\exp[i(kna - \\omega t)]\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the wavevector and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.

To express this in terms of $\\omega$, we use the identity $\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1$. From the dispersion relation, $\\sin(ka/2) = \\omega/\\omega_{\\text{max}}$. Thus, for $k \\in [0, \\pi/a]$, $\\cos(ka/2) = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(ka/2)} = \\sqrt{1 - (\\omega/\\omega_{\\text{max}})^2}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\frac{dk}{d\\omega}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dk}{d\\omega} = \\frac{2}{a\\omega_{\\text{max}}\\sqrt{1 - (\\omega/\\omega_{\\text{max}})^2}} = \\frac{2}{a\\sqrt{\\omega_{\\text{max}}^2 - \\omega^2}}\n$$\nNow we can find the density of states $g(\\omega)$:\n$$\ng(\\omega) = \\frac{a}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{2}{a\\sqrt{\\omega_{\\text{max}}^2 - \\omega^2}} \\right) = \\frac{2}{\\pi\\sqrt{\\omega_{\\text{max}}^2 - \\omega^2}}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $0 < \\omega < \\omega_{\\text{max}}$.

The displacement amplitude ratio is $u/v = -1$. The normalized polarization vector is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the physical motion of these modes. At $k=\\pi/a$, adjacent unit cells move in antiphase ($u_{n+1} \\propto -u_n$, $v_{n+1} \\propto -v_n$).\n- For the mode with $u/v = 1$ (frequency $\\omega_1 = \\sqrt{2K_w/m}$), the atoms $A_n$ and $B_n$ within a unit cell move together ($u=v$). The relative displacement across the strong bond ($K_s$) inside the unit cell is $v_n - u_n$, which has an amplitude of $v-u=0$. The relative displacement across the weak bond ($K_w$) between cells $n$ and $n+1$ is $u_{n+1} - v_n$. With the phase factor for $k=\\pi/a$, this becomes $-u_n - v_n$. The amplitude of this motion is $-u-v = -2u$. This mode, therefore, involves no stretching of the strong bonds; the motion consists of the rigid dimers $(A_nB_n)$ vibrating against each other, selectively stretching only the weak bonds. The frequency correctly depends only on $K_w$.\n\n- For the mode with $u/v = -1$ (frequency $\\omega_2 = \\sqrt{2K_s/m}$), the atoms $A_n$ and $B_n$ within a unit cell move in opposite directions ($u=-v$). The relative displacement across the strong bond ($K_s$) has an amplitude of $v-u = v - (-v) = 2v$. The relative displacement across the weak bond ($K_w$) is $u_{n+1} - v_n$, which becomes $-u_n - v_n$ at the zone boundary. The amplitude of this motion is $-u-v = -(-v)-v=0$. This mode involves motion where the center of mass of each unit cell is stationary, and the atoms within the dimer vibrate against each other. It selectively stretches the strong bonds, and the frequency correctly depends only on $K_s$.\n\nThe two displacement amplitude ratios $u/v$ for the zone-boundary normal modes are $1$ and $-1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3000221"}]}
