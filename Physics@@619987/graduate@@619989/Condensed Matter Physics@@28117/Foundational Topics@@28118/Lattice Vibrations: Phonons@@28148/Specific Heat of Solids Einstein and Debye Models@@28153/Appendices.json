The problem states that the sound speed $v_s$ scales as $v_s \\propto \\sqrt{C/\\rho}$, where $C$ is an elastic modulus and $\\rho$ is the mass density. The elastic moduli are the same for both isotopic samples. The mass densities are $\\rho = n M$ for sample A and $\\rho' = n M'$ for sample B, where the number density $n$ is also the same.\nThus, for any polarization $s$, the sound speed is proportional to $1/\\sqrt{M}$:\n$$v_s \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M}}$$\nLet $v_{s,A}$ and $v_{s,B}$ be the speeds for a given polarization in samples A and B. Then $\\frac{v_{s,A}}{v_{s,B}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M'}{M}}$. This ratio is independent of the polarization $s$.\nThe Debye-averaged sound speeds $v_D$ and $v_D'$ will have the same scaling:\n$$\\frac{v_D}{v_D'} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M'}{M}}$$\nThis can be formally shown from the averaging formula:\n$$\\frac{v_D^3}{v_D'^3} = \\frac{\\sum_s 1/v_{s,B}^3}{\\sum_s 1/v_{s,A}^3} = \\frac{\\sum_s 1/v_{s,B}^3}{\\sum_s 1/(v_{s,B}\\sqrt{M'/M})^3} = \\frac{\\sum_s 1/v_{s,B}^3}{(M/M')^{3/2}\\sum_s 1/v_{s,B}^3} = \\left(\\frac{M'}{M}\\right)^{3/2}$$\nSo, $\\frac{v_D}{v_D'} = \\sqrt{\\frac{M'}{M}}$.\n\nSubstituting this ratio of sound speeds into the expression for the ratio of coefficients:\n$$\\frac{\\beta'}{\\beta} = \\left(\\frac{v_D}{v_D'}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{M'}{M}}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{M'}{M}\\right)^{3/2}$$\n\nPhysical interpretation: The cubic coefficient $\\beta = C_V/T^3$ is proportional to $M^{3/2}$. This means a crystal with heavier isotopes (larger $M$) will have a larger heat capacity at low temperatures. The physical reason is that heavier atoms result in \"softer\" phonon modes. The sound speed $v_D$ is lower for the heavier sample ($v_D \\propto M^{-1/2}$). Consequently, the entire spectrum of phonon frequencies, including the Debye frequency $\\omega_D = v_D (6\\pi^2 n)^{1/3}$, is shifted to lower values. The Debye temperature, $\\Theta_D \\propto \\omega_D \\propto M^{-1/2}$, is also lower. At a given low temperature $T$, a system with a lower $\\Theta_D$ has more of its phonon modes thermally accessible (since the ratio $T/\\Theta_D$ is larger). The easier excitation of these low-energy modes allows the crystal to absorb more heat for a given temperature increase, resulting in a higher heat capacity. The dependence is strong, as $C_V \\propto \\Theta_D^{-3} \\propto (M^{-1/2})^{-3} = M^{3/2}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{M'}{M}\\right)^{3/2}}\n$$", "id": "3016437"}]}
