The vector normal to this plane in Miller indices is $[1, -1, 1]$.

The energy per unit length is therefore:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{SF}}(d) = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}} (Ld)}{L} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}} d\n$$\nThe force resulting from this energy term is attractive, as it pulls the partials together to minimize the high-energy fault area. The magnitude of this attractive force per unit length is:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{SF}} = -\\frac{d E_{\\mathrm{SF}}}{dd} = -\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}}\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the elastic interaction term. The problem states that the repulsive force per unit length between the two parallel partials scales inversely with their separation, $d$. Based on the provided a general expression for the effective elastic interaction prefactor, $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the repulsive force per unit length, $F_{\\mathrm{el}}$, can be written as:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{el}}(d) = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{int}}}{d}\n$$\nwhere $K_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is the elastic interaction parameter. This parameter is composed of the prefactor $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and the square of the magnitude of the interacting Burgers vectors. The two Shockley partials have the same Burgers vector magnitude, $|b_{\\mathrm{p}}|$. The appropriate form of the interaction parameter is $K_{\\mathrm{int}} = K_{\\mathrm{eff}} |b_{\\mathrm{p}}|^2$. Therefore, the repulsive force is:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{el}}(d) = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{eff}} |b_{\\mathrm{p}}|^2}{d}\n$$\nThe prefactor $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is given as a function of the shear modulus $G$, Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, and the angles $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ between the dislocation line and the Burgers vectors of the two partials:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\dfrac{G}{2\\pi}\\left[\\cos(\\alpha_1)\\cos(\\alpha_2) + \\dfrac{1}{1-\\nu}\\sin(\\alpha_1)\\sin(\\alpha_2)\\right]\n$$\n\nAt equilibrium, the repulsive elastic force exactly balances the attractive stacking fault force:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{el}}(d_{\\mathrm{eq}}) + F_{\\mathrm{SF}} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{eff}} |b_{\\mathrm{p}}|^2}{d_{\\mathrm{eq}}} - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}} = 0\n$$\nSolving for the equilibrium separation $d_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ yields the general symbolic expression:\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{eff}} |b_{\\mathrm{p}}|^2}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the magnitude of the Shockley partial Burgers vector is $|b_{\\mathrm{p}}| = a\\sqrt{6}/6$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter. Thus, $|b_{\\mathrm{p}}|^2 = a^2(6/36) = a^2/6$. Substituting this into the expression for $d_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ gives:\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{eff}} a^2}{6\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}}}\n$$\nFor all test cases, the partials are specified to be of pure edge character, meaning their Burgers vectors are perpendicular to the dislocation line. This corresponds to $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha_2 = \\pi/2$ radians. For this specific case, the prefactor $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ simplifies to:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\dfrac{G}{2\\pi}\\left[\\cos(\\pi/2)\\cos(\\pi/2) + \\dfrac{1}{1-\\nu}\\sin(\\pi/2)\\sin(\\pi/2)\\right] = \\dfrac{G}{2\\pi}\\left[0 + \\dfrac{1}{1-\\nu}(1)(1)\\right] = \\dfrac{G}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)}\n$$\nSubstituting this simplified $K_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ into the equation for $d_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, we obtain the final formula for pure edge partials:\n$$\nd_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}}} \\left( \\frac{G}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{a^2}{6} \\right) = \\frac{G a^2}{12\\pi(1-\\nu)\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}}}\n$$\nThis is the expression used for the numerical calculations.\n\nThe computational implementation proceeds as follows for each test case:\n$1$. The input parameters ($a$, $G$, $\\nu$, GSFE path, $w_{\\mathrm{TEM}}$) are processed. All values are converted into base SI units: $a$ from Angstroms ($\\mathrm{\\AA}$) to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$), $G$ from Gigapascals ($\\mathrm{GPa}$) to Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}}$ from millijoules per square meter ($\\mathrm{mJ/m^2}$) to Joules per square meter ($\\mathrm{J/m^2}$). Specifically, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}}$ is taken as the last value in the provided GSFE path array, corresponding to a fractional displacement of $f=1$.\n$2$. The equilibrium separation $d_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is calculated in meters using the derived formula $d_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\frac{G a^2}{12\\pi(1-\\nu)\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ISF}}}$.\n$3$. The calculated separation is converted from meters to nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$) for comparison with the experimental value $w_{\\mathrm{TEM}}$.\n$4$. The theoretical value $d_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is compared against the measured value $w_{\\mathrm{TEM}}$ using the specified relative tolerance $\\delta = 0.10$. The condition for a successful prediction is $|\\frac{d_{\\mathrm{eq}} - w_{\\mathrm{TEM}}}{w_{\\mathrm{TEM}}}| \\le \\delta$. A boolean value (`True` or `False`) is determined based on this comparison.\n$5$. The calculated separation in nanometers, rounded to three decimal places, and the boolean comparison result are stored.\n$6$. The results from all four cases are aggregated and printed in the specified format.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium separation of Shockley partials for several fcc metals\n    and compares the theoretical prediction with experimental TEM data.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Test cases: (a [Å], G [GPa], ν, GSFE path [mJ/m²], w_TEM [nm])\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case 1 (Copper)\n        (3.615, 48, 0.34, [0, 150, 200, 90, 45], 5.5),\n        # Case 2 (Aluminum)\n        (4.049, 26, 0.34, [0, 180, 220, 180, 166], 1.05),\n        # Case 3 (Nickel)\n        (3.524, 76, 0.31, [0, 150, 200, 150, 125], 3.0),\n        # Case 4 (Silver)\n        (4.086, 30, 0.37, [0, 120, 140, 60, 20], 10.7),\n    ]\n\n    # Tolerance for comparison\n    delta = 0.10\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        a_A, G_GPa, nu, gsfe_path_mJ_m2, w_tem_nm = case\n\n        # --- Unit Conversions to SI ---\n        # Lattice parameter from Å to m\n        a_m = a_A * 1e-10\n        # Shear modulus from GPa to Pa (N/m^2)\n        G_Pa = G_GPa * 1e9\n        # Intrinsic stacking fault energy from mJ/m^2 to J/m^2 (N/m)\n        # Gamma_ISF is the value at fractional displacement f=1, the last in the path.\n        gamma_isf_J_m2 = gsfe_path_mJ_m2[-1] * 1e-3\n\n        # --- Calculation of Equilibrium Separation ---\n        # The derived formula for pure edge partials is:\n        # d_eq = (G * a^2) / (12 * pi * (1 - ν) * γ_ISF)\n        \n        numerator = G_Pa * (a_m ** 2)\n        denominator = 12 * np.pi * (1 - nu) * gamma_isf_J_m2\n        \n        d_eq_m = numerator / denominator\n        \n        # Convert result from m to nm for output and comparison\n        d_eq_nm = d_eq_m * 1e9\n\n        # --- Comparison with TEM data ---\n        # Check if the relative error is within the tolerance delta\n        relative_error = abs(d_eq_nm - w_tem_nm) / w_tem_nm\n        is_within_tolerance = relative_error = delta\n\n        # --- Storing results ---\n        # Round the separation to three decimal places\n        results.append(round(d_eq_nm, 3))\n        # Append the boolean result\n        results.append(is_within_tolerance)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # The format is a string representation of a list of floats and booleans.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```", "id": "2982550"}]}
