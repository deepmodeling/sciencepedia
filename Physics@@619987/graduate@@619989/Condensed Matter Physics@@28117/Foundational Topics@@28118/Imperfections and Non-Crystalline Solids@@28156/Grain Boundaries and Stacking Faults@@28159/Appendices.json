The rotation matrix $R$ relating the two grains is:\n$$\nR = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{5} & -\\frac{4}{5} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{4}{5} & \\frac{3}{5} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Coincidence Site Lattice, $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}}$, is defined as the set of lattice points common to both lattices, $\\Lambda$ and the rotated lattice $R\\Lambda$.

Let $v = (v_x, v_y, v_z)^T$ where $v_x, v_y, v_z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n2. $v \\in R\\Lambda$, which means there exists a vector $u \\in \\Lambda$ such that $v = Ru$. Since $u$ must have integer components, this condition is equivalent to stating that the pre-image of $v$ under the rotation $R$ must be an integer vector. That is, $u = R^{-1}v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nSince $R$ is an orthogonal matrix, its inverse $R^{-1}$ is equal to its transpose $R^{T}$. Therefore, the condition for a vector $v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ to be in $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}}$ is $R^{T}v \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the explicit integrality condition. The transpose of the rotation matrix is:\n$$\nR^{T} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{4}{5} & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{4}{5} & \\frac{3}{5} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet $v = (v_x, v_y, v_z)^T$ be a vector in $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$. The vector $R^{T}v$ is:\n$$\nR^{T}v = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{5}v_x + \\frac{4}{5}v_y \\\\\n-\\frac{4}{5}v_x + \\frac{3}{5}v_y \\\\\nv_z\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $R^{T}v$ to be a vector in $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, its components must be integers.\nThe third component is $v_z$, which is already an integer by the definition of $v$.\nThe first two components yield the following conditions for the in-plane coordinates $(v_x, v_y)$:\n1. $\\frac{3}{5}v_x + \\frac{4}{5}v_y \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\implies 3v_x + 4v_y$ must be a multiple of $5$.\n2. $-\\frac{4}{5}v_x + \\frac{3}{5}v_y \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\implies -4v_x + 3v_y$ must be a multiple of $5$.\n\nThese can be expressed as congruence relations modulo $5$:\n1. $3v_x + 4v_y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$\n2. $-4v_x + 3v_y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$\n\nWe can check if these conditions are independent. The first congruence, $3v_x \\equiv -4v_y \\pmod{5}$, simplifies to $3v_x \\equiv v_y \\pmod{5}$. The second, $3v_y \\equiv 4v_x \\pmod{5}$, implies $v_y \\equiv \\frac{4}{3}v_x \\pmod{5}$. Since $3 \\times 2 = 6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, the inverse of $3$ modulo $5$ is $2$. Thus, $v_y \\equiv 4 \\times 2 v_x \\pmod{5}$, which is $v_y \\equiv 8v_x \\pmod{5}$, or $v_y \\equiv 3v_x \\pmod{5}$. The two congruences are equivalent. Thus, the integrality condition that characterizes all vectors in $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}}$ is given by the single congruence relation on the in-plane coordinates:\n$$\n3v_x + 4v_y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}\n$$\n\nNext, we construct a primitive basis $\\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$ for $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}}$. The basis vector $b_3$ must be parallel to $[001]$. The simplest choice is $b_3 = (0, 0, 1)^T$. We verify that it is a CSL vector: for $v_x=0$ and $v_y=0$, the condition $3(0)+4(0)=0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ is satisfied. The component $v_z=1$ is an integer. So, $b_3$ is a valid CSL vector.\n\nNow we need to find a primitive basis for the two-dimensional CSL in the $xy$-plane. We are looking for two linearly independent integer vectors $(v_x, v_y)$ that satisfy $3v_x + 4v_y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ and generate all other such vectors. Let's find two simple solutions.\n- If we set $v_x = 1$, the congruence becomes $3 + 4v_y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, or $4v_y \\equiv -3 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$. Multiplying by $4$ (since $4 \\times 4 = 16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$), we get $v_y \\equiv 8 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{5}$. The simplest integer solution is $(v_x, v_y) = (1, 3)$. Let's use this to define our first basis vector in the plane: $b_1 = (1, 3, 0)^T$.\n- To find a second, linearly independent vector, let's try $v_x = 2$. The congruence becomes $3(2) + 4v_y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, or $6 + 4v_y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, which simplifies to $1 + 4v_y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$, or $4v_y \\equiv -1 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$. This gives $v_y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. The simplest integer solution is $(v_x, v_y) = (2, 1)$. We define our second basis vector: $b_2 = (2, 1, 0)^T$.\n\nSo, we have a proposed basis for $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}}$:\n$$\nb_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad b_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad b_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo verify that this basis is primitive, we must show that any vector $v \\in \\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}}$ can be written as an integer linear combination $v = c_1 b_1 + c_2 b_2 + c_3 b_3$ where $c_1, c_2, c_3 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor a general CSL vector $v = (v_x, v_y, v_z)^T$, we have $v_z = c_3$. Since $v_z$ is an integer, $c_3$ is an integer. For the in-plane components:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSolving for $c_1$ and $c_2$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{1 - 6} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -2 \\\\ -3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = -\\frac{1}{5} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x - 2v_y \\\\ -3v_x + v_y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor the basis to be primitive, $c_1$ and $c_2$ must be integers for any CSL vector $(v_x, v_y, 0)^T$. This requires $v_x - 2v_y$ and $-3v_x + v_y$ to be divisible by $5$. From the CSL condition, $v_y \\equiv 3v_x \\pmod{5}$. Substituting this into the expressions:\n- $v_x - 2v_y \\equiv v_x - 2(3v_x) = v_x - 6v_x = -5v_x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\n- $-3v_x + v_y \\equiv -3v_x + (3v_x) = 0 \\pmod{5}$.\nBoth expressions are divisible by $5$, so $c_1$ and $c_2$ are indeed integers. Thus, the basis $\\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$ is a primitive basis for $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the coincidence index $\\Sigma$. It is defined as the index of the subgroup $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}}$ in $\\Lambda$, which is given by the ratio of the volumes of the primitive cells, $\\Sigma = \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Lambda) / \\mathrm{Vol}(\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}})$. This is equal to the absolute value of the determinant of the change-of-basis matrix from the basis of $\\Lambda$ to the basis of $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{CSL}}$.\nThe standard basis for $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$. The change-of-basis matrix $B$ has the CSL basis vectors $\\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$ as its columns:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe coincidence index $\\Sigma$ is then computed as:\n$$\n\\Sigma = |\\det(B)| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right|\n$$\nThe determinant can be found by cofactor expansion along the third column:\n$$\n\\det(B) = 1 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = 1 \\cdot (1 \\cdot 1 - 2 \\cdot 3) = 1 - 6 = -5\n$$\nTherefore, the coincidence index is:\n$$\n\\Sigma = |-5| = 5\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "2992781"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical concepts of defect geometry and energy find their application in predicting material properties, often through computational methods.
