The analysis must begin from first principles.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient in a cubic crystal can be defined from the long-time behavior of the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of a random-walking particle. For a three-dimensional lattice, this relationship is given by:\n$$\nD_s = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle}{6t}\n$$\nFor a random walk consisting of discrete jumps of length $\\lambda$ occurring at a total frequency $\\Gamma_s$, the MSD after a long time $t$ is $\\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle = (\\Gamma_s t) \\lambda^2$. However, this expression assumes that the direction of each jump is independent of the previous one. In vacancy-mediated solute diffusion, the jump of a solute into an adjacent vacancy leaves the vacancy at the solute's original site, creating a high probability for a reverse jump. This introduces correlations between successive jump vectors. The effect of these correlations is captured by the correlation factor, $f_s$, which is less than $1$. The general expression for the diffusion coefficient is therefore:\n$$\nD_s = \\frac{1}{6} f_s \\Gamma_s \\lambda^2\n$$\nThe problem statement makes a crucial simplifying assumption: \"successive solute displacements are effectively uncorrelated\". This is a directive to set the correlation factor $f_s = 1$. Consequently, the parameters provided for bulk vacancy motion ($\\nu_v$ and $E_m^v$), which would be necessary to calculate $f_s$ in a more sophisticated model (e.g., the five-frequency model), are not required for this specific problem.\n\nThe remaining terms in the expression for $D_s$ must be determined.\nFirst, the jump distance, $\\lambda$, for a substitutional atom in an FCC lattice corresponds to the distance between nearest-neighbor sites. Given a lattice parameter $a$, the nearest-neighbor distance is $\\lambda = a/\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the squared jump distance is:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 = \\frac{a^2}{2}\n$$\nNext, we derive the total jump frequency of the solute atom, $\\Gamma_s$. A solute atom can only jump if there is a vacancy on one of its $z$ nearest-neighbor sites. The total jump frequency is the sum of the jump rates into each of these $z$ sites. Let $\\omega_{sv}$ be the frequency of exchange between the solute and a vacancy located on an adjacent site. Let $c_v^{NN}$ be the probability that any given nearest-neighbor site of the solute is occupied by a vacancy. Assuming the dilute limit allows us to treat each of the $z$ neighboring sites independently and neglect cases with multiple adjacent vacancies. The total jump rate is then the product of the number of neighboring sites, the probability of a vacancy being on such a site, and the exchange frequency:\n$$\n\\Gamma_s = z \\, c_v^{NN} \\, \\omega_{sv}\n$$\nFor an FCC lattice, the coordination number is $z=12$.\n\nThe exchange frequency, $\\omega_{sv}$, is a thermally activated process governed by an Arrhenius-type relation. It is the product of an attempt frequency, $\\nu_{sv}$, and a Boltzmann factor containing the migration energy barrier, $E_m^{sv}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{sv} = \\nu_{sv} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m^{sv}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe probability of finding a vacancy at a nearest-neighbor site to the solute, $c_v^{NN}$, is related to the equilibrium vacancy concentration in the bulk, $c_v^{bulk}$.

A positive binding energy signifies that the energy of the system is lower when the vacancy is adjacent to the solute.

Displacement statistics\nEach hop displaces the particle by a vector $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}$ of magnitude $a$, aligned with one of the coordinate axes, selected uniformly among the four directions. The squared displacement per hop is $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}^2 = a^2$. For independent hops, the mean squared displacement after $N$ hops is $\\langle \\Delta \\mathbf{r}^2 \\rangle_N = N a^2$. Thus, for continuous time,\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta \\mathbf{r}^2(t) \\rangle\n= \\langle N(t) \\rangle a^2\n= R t\\, a^2\n= 4 r\\, a^2\\, t.\n$$\n\n3. Einstein relation and diffusion coefficient\nBy the Einstein relation in $d=2$ dimensions,\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{KMC}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\langle \\Delta \\mathbf{r}^2(t) \\rangle}{2 d t}\n= \\frac{4 r a^2}{2 \\cdot 2}\n= a^2 r.\n$$\n\n4. Arrhenius rate from Transition State Theory\nBy Transition State Theory (TST), the nearest-neighbor hopping rate per bond is\n$$\nr = \\nu_0 \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\nu_0$ is the attempt frequency, $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the activation barrier, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is Boltzmann’s constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\n5. Closed-form result for KMC diffusion\nCombining the above,\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{KMC}} = a^2 \\nu_0 \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right).\n$$\nIn implementation, $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is provided in electronvolts and must be converted to joules to be commensurate with $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ in joules.\n\nAlgorithm for KMC:\n- Convert $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ from electronvolts to joules using $1\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}$.\n- Compute the Arrhenius factor $\\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right)$.\n- Return $D_{\\mathrm{KMC}} = a^2 \\nu_0 \\times \\text{Arrhenius factor}$.\n\nPart II: Overdamped Langevin Molecular Dynamics in a periodic potential\n\n1. Smoluchowski dynamics and microscopic diffusion\nIn the overdamped regime, the stochastic dynamics along one coordinate is governed by the Smoluchowski equation, with a free-particle diffusion constant\n$$\nD_0 = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\gamma},\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the friction coefficient in $\\mathrm{kg/s}$. The potential is\n$$\nU(x) = V_0 \\left[ 1 - \\cos\\left( \\frac{2\\pi x}{a} \\right) \\right],\n$$\nwith periodic minima at $x = n a$ for integer $n$ and barrier height $E_{\\mathrm{a}} = 2 V_0$ at $x = (n + \\tfrac{1}{2}) a$.\n\n2. Curvatures at the minimum and at the saddle\nThe second derivative of the potential is\n$$\nU''(x) = V_0 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\right)^2 \\cos\\left( \\frac{2\\pi x}{a} \\right).\n$$\nThus, at a minimum $x_{\\mathrm{m}} = n a$, $\\cos(0) = 1$ gives\n$$\nU''(x_{\\mathrm{m}}) = V_0 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\right)^2,\n$$\nand at the saddle $x_{\\mathrm{s}} = (n + \\tfrac{1}{2}) a$, $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ gives\n$$\nU''(x_{\\mathrm{s}}) = - V_0 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\right)^2.\n$$\n\n3. Kramers escape rate in the overdamped limit\nIn the overdamped (Smoluchowski) regime, the Kramers-Langer asymptotic expression for the escape rate over a single barrier is\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{OD}} = \\frac{D_0}{2\\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\sqrt{ U''(x_{\\mathrm{m}})\\, \\left| U''(x_{\\mathrm{s}}) \\right| } \\; \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right).\n$$\nSubstituting the curvatures,\n$$\n\\sqrt{ U''(x_{\\mathrm{m}})\\, \\left| U''(x_{\\mathrm{s}}) \\right| } = V_0 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\right)^2.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{OD}} = \\frac{D_0}{2\\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\, V_0 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\right)^2 \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right)\n= D_0 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_0}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right).\n$$\n\n4. Mapping the escape process to an unbiased lattice random walk\nAt long times, the sequence of escapes between adjacent wells produces an unbiased nearest-neighbor random walk with step length $a$ and per-direction rate $k_{\\mathrm{OD}}$. For a two-dimensional square lattice, there are four directions, but in either one-dimensional or two-dimensional unbiased nearest-neighbor random walks, the diffusion coefficient is related to the per-direction rate $k$ by $D = a^2 k$ as shown in Part I (the dimension enters equally in the numerator and denominator of the Einstein relation and cancels). Thus, in two dimensions,\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{MD}} = a^2 k_{\\mathrm{OD}}.\n$$\nUsing $E_{\\mathrm{a}} = 2 V_0$,\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{MD}} = a^2 \\, D_0 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_0}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right)\n= D_0 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi V_0}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right)\n= D_0 \\left( \\frac{\\pi E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right).\n$$\n\n5. Closed-form result for MD diffusion\nWith $D_0 = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\gamma}$,\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{MD}} = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\pi E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right)\n= \\frac{\\pi E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{\\gamma} \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right).\n$$\nEquivalently, one may compute it as\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{MD}} = D_0 \\left( \\frac{\\pi E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) \\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right),\n$$\nwhich emphasizes the thermal diffusivity $D_0$ and the Kramers prefactor.\n\n6. Ratio and consistency check\nThe ratio of the two predictions is\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{KMC}}}{D_{\\mathrm{MD}}}\n= \\frac{a^2 \\nu_0}{ D_0 \\left( \\frac{\\pi E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) }\n= \\frac{a^2 \\nu_0 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\pi E_{\\mathrm{a}} D_0}\n= \\frac{a^2 \\nu_0 \\gamma}{\\pi E_{\\mathrm{a}}},\n$$\nwhich, in this asymptotic regime, is independent of temperature for fixed $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and the same microscopic $a$, $\\nu_0$, and $\\gamma$, providing a nontrivial cross-check.\n\nAlgorithm for MD:\n- Convert $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ from electronvolts to joules.\n- Compute $D_0 = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\gamma}$.\n- Compute the Arrhenius factor $\\exp\\!\\left( - \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right)$.\n- Return $D_{\\mathrm{MD}} = D_0 \\left( \\frac{\\pi E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) \\times \\text{Arrhenius factor}$.\n\nImplementation details and units:\n- Use $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J/K}$.\n- Use $1\\ \\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}$.\n- Inputs $a$ in meters, $\\nu_0$ in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ in electronvolts, $T$ in kelvin, and $\\gamma$ in $\\mathrm{kg/s}$.\n- Outputs $D_{\\mathrm{KMC}}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{MD}}$ in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$; the ratio is dimensionless.\n- The program will compute, for each test case, $[D_{\\mathrm{KMC}}, D_{\\mathrm{MD}}, D_{\\mathrm{KMC}}/D_{\\mathrm{MD}}]$ and print a single line: a JSON-like list of lists without spaces.\n\nNumerical stability:\n- Only elementary functions and constants are used; no stochastic simulation is performed; results are deterministic.\n- Exponentials are evaluated in double precision and the chosen test parameters avoid underflow or overflow.\n\nThis completes the derivation and algorithmic design based on first principles for both Kinetic Monte Carlo and overdamped Langevin Molecular Dynamics coarse-grained predictions of diffusion in crystals.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Physical constants\nkB = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\neV_to_J = 1.602176634e-19  # 1 eV in J\n\ndef D_kmc(a_m, nu0_s_inv, Ea_eV, T_K):\n    \"\"\"\n    KMC diffusion coefficient for a 2D square lattice with 4 equivalent NN hops:\n    D_KMC = a^2 * r, where r = nu0 * exp(-Ea/(k_B T)).\n    Units:\n      a_m: meters\n      nu0_s_inv: 1/s\n      Ea_eV: eV\n      T_K: K\n    Returns D in m^2/s.\n    \"\"\"\n    Ea_J = Ea_eV * eV_to_J\n    arr = np.exp(-Ea_J / (kB * T_K))\n    return (a_m ** 2) * nu0_s_inv * arr\n\ndef D_md_overdamped(a_m, Ea_eV, T_K, gamma_kg_per_s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Overdamped MD (Smoluchowski-Kramers) diffusion in a sinusoidal periodic potential:\n    D_MD = D0 * (pi * Ea / (k_B T)) * exp(-Ea/(k_B T)), where D0 = k_B T / gamma.\n    Units:\n      a_m: meters (not explicitly needed in closed form after mapping)\n      Ea_eV: eV\n      T_K: K\n      gamma_kg_per_s: kg/s\n    Returns D in m^2/s.\n    \"\"\"\n    Ea_J = Ea_eV * eV_to_J\n    D0 = kB * T_K / gamma_kg_per_s\n    arr = np.exp(-Ea_J / (kB * T_K))\n    return D0 * (np.pi * Ea_J / (kB * T_K)) * arr\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case: (a [m], nu0 [1/s], Ea [eV], T [K], gamma [kg/s])\n    test_cases = [\n        (2.5e-10, 1.0e13, 0.6, 800.0, 5.0e-12),\n        (2.5e-10, 1.0e13, 0.6, 1200.0, 5.0e-12),\n        (2.5e-10, 1.0e13, 0.2, 800.0, 5.0e-12),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for a, nu0, Ea_eV, T, gamma in test_cases:\n        d_kmc = D_kmc(a, nu0, Ea_eV, T)\n        d_md = D_md_overdamped(a, Ea_eV, T, gamma)\n        ratio = d_kmc / d_md\n        results.append([d_kmc, d_md, ratio])\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format: no spaces, single line.\n    def format_list(lst):\n        # Format a list of floats without spaces using Python's default str for floats.\n        return \"[\" + \",\".join(str(x) for x in lst) + \"]\"\n\n    output = \"[\" + \",\".join(format_list(r) for r in results) + \"]\"\n    print(output)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2982109"}]}
