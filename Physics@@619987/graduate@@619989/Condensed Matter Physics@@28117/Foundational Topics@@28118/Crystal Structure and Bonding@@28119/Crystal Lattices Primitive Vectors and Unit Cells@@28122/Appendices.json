Primitive Vectors for the FCC Lattice**\n\nThe FCC lattice, within its conventional cubic cell, has lattice points at the $8$ corners and at the centers of the $6$ faces. With the origin at $(0, 0, 0)$, the corner points are at positions such as $(0, 0, 0)$, $(a, 0, 0)$, $(0, a, 0)$, etc. The face-center points are at positions such as $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$, and $(0, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$.\n\nTo form a set of primitive vectors, we can choose three linearly independent vectors that connect the lattice point at the origin to other nearby lattice points. A standard choice connects the origin to the centers of the three faces that meet at the origin. These vectors are:\n$\\mathbf{a}_1$: Vector to the face center in the $xy$-plane.\n$\\mathbf{a}_2$: Vector to the face center in the $xz$-plane.\n$\\mathbf{a}_3$: Vector to the face center in the $yz$-plane.\n\nIn Cartesian components, these vectors are:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_1 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = \\begin{pmatrix} a/2 \\\\ a/2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\begin{pmatrix} a/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ a/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_3 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ a/2 \\\\ a/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThese three vectors are linearly independent and can generate all points in the FCC lattice through integer linear combinations. For example, the corner point at $(a, 0, 0)$ is generated by $\\mathbf{a}_1 + \\mathbf{a}_2 - \\mathbf{a}_3$.\n\n**2. Primitive Vectors for the BCC Lattice**\n\nThe BCC lattice has lattice points at the $8$ corners of the conventional cubic cell and one point at the body center, $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$. All points in a Bravais lattice must be equivalent. The set of all corner points and body-center points of an infinite array of cubes forms the BCC lattice.\n\nA common and symmetric set of primitive vectors connects a lattice point to other nearby lattice points. Let the origin $(0,0,0)$ be a lattice point. A set of three linearly independent vectors that connect the origin to other lattice points can serve as primitive vectors. A standard choice is:\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_1 = \\frac{a}{2}(-\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\begin{pmatrix} -a/2 \\\\ a/2 \\\\ a/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\begin{pmatrix} a/2 \\\\ -a/2 \\\\ a/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{b}_3 = \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\begin{pmatrix} a/2 \\\\ a/2 \\\\ -a/2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThese vectors are linearly independent and generate all points of the BCC lattice. For example, the corner point at $(a, 0, 0)$ is generated by $\\mathbf{b}_2 + \\mathbf{b}_3$, and the body-center point at $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$ is generated by $\\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2 + \\mathbf{b}_3$.\n\n**3.

The reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}$ is expressed in terms of the reciprocal lattice primitive vectors $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$ and integer indices $h, k$ as $\\mathbf{G} = h\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1} + k\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2}$. The basis vector $\\mathbf{d}$ is given as $\\mathbf{d} = (\\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2})/3$.\n\nThe dot product in the exponent is:\n$$\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{d} = \\left(h\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1} + k\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{a}_{1}+\\mathbf{a}_{2}}{3}\\right)$$\nUsing the distributive property of the dot product, we expand this expression:\n$$\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{d} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( h\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{1} + h\\,\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{2} + k\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{1} + k\\,\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{2} \\right)$$\nThe problem provides the fundamental duality relation between the direct ($\\mathbf{a}_j$) and reciprocal ($\\mathbf{b}_i$) lattice primitive vectors: $\\mathbf{b}_{i}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{j} = 2\\pi\\,\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Applying this relation to each term in the sum:\n- $\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{1} = 2\\pi\\,\\delta_{11} = 2\\pi$\n- $\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{2} = 2\\pi\\,\\delta_{12} = 0$\n- $\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{1} = 2\\pi\\,\\delta_{21} = 0$\n- $\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}_{2} = 2\\pi\\,\\delta_{22} = 2\\pi$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{d}$:\n$$\\mathbf{G}\\cdot\\mathbf{d} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( h(2\\pi) + h(0) + k(0) + k(2\\pi) \\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} (h+k)$$\nNow we substitute this phase back into the expression for the structure factor $S(\\mathbf{G})$:\n$$S(\\mathbf{G}) = f_{A} + f_{B}\\,\\exp\\left(i\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k)\\right)$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the structure factor in terms of $h, k, f_A$, and $f_B$.\n\nNext, we analyze the condition for complete destructive interference, $S(\\mathbf{G})=0$.\n$$f_{A} + f_{B}\\,\\exp\\left(i\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k)\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\exp\\left(i\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k)\\right) = -\\frac{f_{A}}{f_{B}}$$\nFor this equation to have a solution, the magnitude of the right-hand side must be $1$, which implies $|-f_A/f_B| = 1$, or $|f_A| = |f_B|$. If the scattering amplitudes of the two basis atoms have different magnitudes, complete destructive interference is impossible. Assuming $|f_A| = |f_B|$, we now analyze the two specific physical cases given.\n\nCase 1: Identical atoms on both sublattices ($f_{A}=f_{B}=f$).\nThis is the case for X-ray diffraction from a material like graphene, where all atoms are carbon. We assume $f$ is real and positive. The condition for extinction becomes:\n$$\\exp\\left(i\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k)\\right) = -\\frac{f}{f} = -1$$\nIn terms of phase, this means:\n$$\\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k) = (2m+1)\\pi, \\quad m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\n$$2(h+k) = 3(2m+1)$$\nThe left-hand side, $2(h+k)$, is an even integer for any integers $h,k$. The right-hand side, $3(2m+1)$, is an odd integer for any integer $m$. An even integer can never equal an odd integer. Therefore, this condition can never be satisfied.\nThe implication is that for a honeycomb lattice with identical atoms on both sublattices, there are no reciprocal lattice vectors for which the structure factor is zero. Complete extinction does not occur. Instead, the intensity of the diffraction peaks, which is proportional to $|S(\\mathbf{G})|^2$, is modulated.\nLet $N=h+k$. The phase factor $\\exp(i\\,2\\pi N/3)$ can take one of three values:\n- If $N=h+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, the phase factor is $1$. $|S(\\mathbf{G})|^2 = |f(1+1)|^2 = 4|f|^2$.\n- If $N=h+k \\equiv 1 \\text{ or } 2 \\pmod{3}$, the phase factor is $e^{i2\\pi/3}$ or $e^{-i2\\pi/3}$. $|S(\\mathbf{G})|^2 = |f(1+e^{\\pm i2\\pi/3})|^2 = |f|^2|1 - 1/2 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}/2|^2 = |f|^2|1/2 \\pm i\\sqrt{3}/2|^2 = |f|^2$.\nThus, some diffraction peaks are more intense than others, but none are fully extinguished.\n\nCase 2: Sublattices with opposite scattering lengths ($f_{B}=-f_{A}$).\nThis scenario can be relevant in neutron scattering. We set $f_{B}=-f_{A}$ (and assume $f_A \\neq 0$). The condition for extinction, $S(\\mathbf{G})=0$, becomes:\n$$f_{A} + (-f_{A})\\,\\exp\\left(i\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k)\\right) = 0$$\n$$f_{A}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(i\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k)\\right)\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\exp\\left(i\\,\\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k)\\right) = 1$$\nThis condition is met if the phase is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$:\n$$\\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k) = 2\\pi m, \\quad m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$$\n$$h+k = 3m$$\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for diffraction extinction when $f_B = -f_A$ is that the sum of the Miller indices for the reciprocal lattice planes, $h+k$, must be a multiple of $3$.\nThe implication is that all reciprocal lattice points of the underlying triangular Bravais lattice for which $h+k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ will have zero diffraction intensity. Only the points for which $h+k \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ will produce diffraction peaks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{f_{A} + f_{B} \\exp\\left(i \\frac{2\\pi}{3}(h+k)\\right)}$$", "id": "2979326"}]}
