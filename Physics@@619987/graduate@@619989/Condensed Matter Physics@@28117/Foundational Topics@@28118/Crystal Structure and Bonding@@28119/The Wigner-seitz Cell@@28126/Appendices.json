It describes a standard physical system (a 2D Bravais lattice) and asks for the determination of a well-defined geometric construct (the Wigner-Seitz cell) using established principles of condensed matter physics. The provided primitive vectors, $\\mathbf{u} = (\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$ and $\\mathbf{v} = (\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{b}{2})$, correctly generate the centered rectangular lattice. The condition $a \\geq b$ is a valid constraint that ensures a well-defined ordering of nearest-neighbor distances. The tasks are clear, objective, and solvable.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe Wigner-Seitz cell centered at the origin is the set of all points $\\mathbf{r}=(x, y)$ that are closer to the origin than to any other lattice point $\\mathbf{R}_{m,n} = m\\mathbf{u} + n\\mathbf{v}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers, not both zero. The condition is $|\\mathbf{r}| \\leq |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}_{m,n}|$ for all non-zero $\\mathbf{R}_{m,n}$. This inequality is equivalent to $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_{m,n} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}_{m,n}|^2$. The boundaries of the Wigner-Seitz cell are the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors connecting the origin to the nearest lattice points.\n\nFirst, we must identify the shortest non-zero lattice vectors $\\mathbf{R}_{m,n} = (\\frac{a}{2}(m+n), \\frac{b}{2}(m-n))$. The squared length is $|\\mathbf{R}_{m,n}|^2 = \\frac{a^2}{4}(m+n)^2 + \\frac{b^2}{4}(m-n)^2$.\n\nLet's identify the shortest vectors:\n1.  For $(m,n) = (1,1)$ or $(-1,-1)$: $\\mathbf{R} = \\pm(a, 0)$. Squared length is $a^2$.\n2.  For $(m,n) = (1,-1)$ or $(-1,1)$: $\\mathbf{R} = \\pm(0, b)$. Squared length is $b^2$.\n3.  For $(m,n) = (1,0)$, $(-1,0)$, $(0,1)$, or $(0,-1)$: $\\mathbf{R} = (\\pm \\frac{a}{2}, \\pm \\frac{b}{2})$. Squared length is $\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{b^2}{4} = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\n\nGiven $a \\geq b > 0$, we compare the squared lengths:\n-   $b^2 \\leq a^2$.\n-   Comparing $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$ with $a^2$: $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4} \\leq a^2 \\iff a^2+b^2 \\leq 4a^2 \\iff b^2 \\leq 3a^2$. This is always true since $a \\geq b$.\n-   Comparing $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$ with $b^2$: $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4} \\leq b^2 \\iff a^2+b^2 \\leq 4b^2 \\iff a^2 \\leq 3b^2$. This is true if $a \\leq \\sqrt{3}b$.\n\nThis analysis indicates that the set of vectors defining the cell boundaries depends on the ratio $a/b$. However, the Wigner-Seitz cell is the intersection of all half-planes $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} \\leq \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}|^2$. A side of the cell might be formed by a bisector of a vector that is not in the set of the absolute shortest vectors.\n\nThe boundary lines are given by the equations $\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} = \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{R}|^2$:\n1.  From $\\mathbf{R} = (\\pm a, 0)$: $\\pm ax = \\frac{1}{2}a^2 \\implies x = \\pm \\frac{a}{2}$.\n2.  From $\\mathbf{R} = (0, \\pm b)$: $\\pm by = \\frac{1}{2}b^2 \\implies y = \\pm \\frac{b}{2}$.\n3.  From $\\mathbf{R} = (\\pm \\frac{a}{2}, \\pm \\frac{b}{2})$: for $\\mathbf{R} = (\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$, the equation is $x\\frac{a}{2} + y\\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{a^2}{4}+\\frac{b^2}{4}) = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{8}$. This simplifies to $ax+by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$. By symmetry, we have four such lines: $ax \\pm by = \\pm\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\n\n#### Explanation for Non-Rectangular Shape\nA simple rectangular Wigner-Seitz cell would be defined solely by the planes $x=\\pm a/2$ and $y=\\pm b/2$. This would be the case for a simple rectangular lattice. However, for the centered rectangular lattice, we must also consider the constraints imposed by the lattice points at the center, which correspond to the lines $ax \\pm by = \\pm\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\n\nLet's test if a corner of the simple rectangle, for instance $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$, satisfies the inequality from the bisector of $\\mathbf{R}=(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$. The inequality is $ax+by \\leq \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\nSubstituting the point's coordinates: $a(\\frac{a}{2}) + b(\\frac{b}{2}) = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{2}$.\nThe inequality becomes $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{2} \\leq \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$, which simplifies to $2 \\leq 1$. This is false. Therefore, the corners of the rectangle defined by $x=\\pm a/2$ and $y=\\pm b/2$ are \"cut off\" by the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors pointing to the centers of the conventional cells. This truncation of the corners results in a polygonal shape that is not a simple rectangle. For $a>b$, it is a hexagon.\n\n#### Computation of the Hexagonal Cell Vertices\nFor $a>b$, the Wigner-Seitz cell is a hexagon. Its vertices are points that are equidistant from the origin and two other non-collinear lattice points. By symmetry, the vertices appear in sets.\nThe vertices of the hexagon are formed by the intersections of the boundary lines. Since $a \\geq b$, $b^2 \\leq a^2$, which implies that the lines $y=\\pm b/2$ form boundaries, while the lines $x=\\pm a/2$ might not. The vertices of the hexagon must lie within the strip $|x| \\le a/2$. The maximum x-coordinate of any vertex will be $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}$. Since $\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a} \\leq \\frac{a}{2}$ (as $a^2+b^2 \\leq 2a^2 \\iff b^2 \\leq a^2$), the cell is always contained within the region $|x| \\leq a/2$. Thus, the lines $x=\\pm a/2$ do not form boundaries of the Wigner-Seitz cell for $a>b$. The boundaries are formed by $y = \\pm \\frac{b}{2}$ and $ax \\pm by = \\pm\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$.\n\nThe vertices are the intersections of these boundary lines.\n-   **Rightmost vertex:** This vertex lies on the $x$-axis $(y=0)$. It is equidistant from the origin and the two lattice points $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$ and $(\\frac{a}{2}, -\\frac{b}{2})$. Thus it is the intersection of the lines $ax+by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$ and $ax-by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$. Adding these equations gives $2ax = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{2}$, which yields $x = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}$. The vertex is $(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0)$.\n\n-   **Other vertices:** The remaining vertices are found by symmetry and by intersecting the other relevant boundary lines.\n    - The vertex in the first quadrant is equidistant from the origin, $(0,b)$, and $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{b}{2})$. It is the intersection of the bisector lines $y=\\frac{b}{2}$ and $ax+by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$. Substituting $y=\\frac{b}{2}$ into the second equation: $ax + b(\\frac{b}{2}) = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4} \\implies ax = \\frac{a^2-b^2}{4} \\implies x = \\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}$. The vertex is $(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2})$.\n\nThe six vertices, ordered counterclockwise starting from the rightmost vertex on the $x$-axis, are:\n\n-   Vertex 1: $(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0)$\n-   Vertex 2: Intersection of $ax+by = \\frac{a^2+b^2}{4}$ and $y=\\frac{b}{2}$, which is $(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2})$.\n-   Vertex 3: By symmetry across the $y$-axis from Vertex 2, $(-\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2})$.\n-   Vertex 4: By symmetry across the origin from Vertex 1, $(-\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0)$.\n-   Vertex 5: By symmetry across the origin from Vertex 2, $(-\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, -\\frac{b}{2})$.\n-   Vertex 6: By symmetry across the $x$-axis from Vertex 2, $(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, -\\frac{b}{2})$.\nThis hexagonal shape is valid for $a>b$. In the special case $a=b$, the coordinates for vertices 2 and 3 become $(0, b/2)$, and vertices 5 and 6 become $(0, -b/2)$. The hexagon degenerates into a square with vertices on the axes, which is the correct Wigner-Seitz cell for a simple square lattice.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0\\right), \\left(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, \\frac{b}{2}\\right), \\left(-\\frac{a^2+b^2}{4a}, 0\\right), \\left(-\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, -\\frac{b}{2}\\right), \\left(\\frac{a^2-b^2}{4a}, -\\frac{b}{2}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3020949"}, {"introduction": "This final practice advances our analysis from analytical derivation to computational implementation, a vital skill in modern condensed matter physics.

The task is to construct the Wigner-Seitz cell (WSC) for several Bravais lattices using two different computational strategies—a naive enumeration and a symmetry-exploiting approach—and to verify that both methods yield the same result.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the geometric definition of the Wigner-Seitz cell and the application of group theory to optimize its construction. The WSC, centered at the origin of a Bravais lattice $\\mathcal{L}$, is the set of all points in space closer to the origin than to any other lattice point $R \\in \\mathcal{L} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This is equivalent to the Voronoi cell of the origin. Geometrically, this region is defined by the intersection of a set of half-spaces. For each nonzero lattice vector $R$, the perpendicular bisector plane between the origin and $R$ is given by the equation $x \\cdot R = \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert R \\rVert^2$. The WSC consists of all points $x$ on the same side of this plane as the origin, leading to the inequality $x \\cdot R \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert R \\rVert^2$. The WSC is thus the intersection of all such half-spaces:\n$$\nW = \\bigcap_{R \\in \\mathcal{L}\\setminus\\{0\\}} \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mid x \\cdot R \\le \\tfrac{1}{2} \\lVert R \\rVert^2 \\}\n$$\nIn any practical computation, it is infeasible to intersect an infinite number of half-spaces. However, only the half-spaces corresponding to the lattice vectors $R$ closest to the origin are typically required to define the facets of the WSC. Half-spaces from more distant vectors $R$ are redundant, as they contain the cell defined by the nearer vectors. This justifies the common computational practice of considering only lattice vectors within a certain cutoff radius, $\\lVert R \\rVert \\le R_{\\text{cut}}$, which is the basis for the \"naive\" strategy. The set of integers $n_i$ used to generate the lattice vectors $R = n_1 a_1 + n_2 a_2 + n_3 a_3$ is also bounded to a box, for instance $n_i \\in [-N, N]$, ensuring a finite candidate set of vectors.\n\nThe primary scientific principle to be demonstrated is the exploitation of symmetry. The point group $G$ of a lattice is the set of all rotation operations $g$ (represented by orthogonal matrices) that leave the lattice invariant, i.e., for any lattice vector $R$, the vector $gR$ is also a lattice vector. Consequently, the set of all lattice vectors $\\mathcal{L}$ is closed under the action of $G$.\n\nThis symmetry has a profound implication for the structure of the WSC. Let $g \\in G$ be a symmetry operation. Since $g$ is an isometry (a distance-preserving transformation), it is represented by an orthogonal matrix, satisfying $(gx) \\cdot (gy) = x \\cdot y$ and $\\lVert gx \\rVert = \\lVert x \\rVert$. The half-space condition $x \\cdot R \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert R \\rVert^2$ is transformed by $g$ as follows:\nLet $x' = gx$ and $R' = gR$. The condition for $x'$ to be in the half-space defined by $R'$ is $x' \\cdot R' \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert R' \\rVert^2$. Substituting the transformed variables, we get $(gx) \\cdot (gR) \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert gR \\rVert^2$. Due to orthogonality, this simplifies to $x \\cdot R \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert R \\rVert^2$, which is the original condition for $x$ being in the half-space defined by $R$. Thus, a point $x$ satisfies the half-space condition for $R$ if and only if the transformed point $gx$ satisfies the half-space condition for the transformed vector $gR$. We can state this as $g(\\{x \\mid x \\cdot R \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert R \\rVert^2\\}) = \\{y \\mid y \\cdot gR \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert gR \\rVert^2\\}$.\n\nThe WSC is the intersection of all half-spaces: $W = \\bigcap_{R \\in \\mathcal{L}\\setminus\\{0\\}} H_R$, where $H_R$ is the half-space for vector $R$. Applying a group operation $g$ to the cell gives $gW = g(\\bigcap_R H_R) = \\bigcap_R (gH_R) = \\bigcap_R H_{gR}$. Since the set of lattice vectors $\\{R\\}$ is invariant under $G$, the set $\\{gR \\mid R \\in \\mathcal{L}\\setminus\\{0\\}\\}$ is identical to $\\mathcal{L}\\setminus\\{0\\}$. Therefore, $\\bigcap_R H_{gR} = \\bigcap_{R'} H_{R'} = W$. This proves that the Wigner-Seitz cell is invariant under all operations of the lattice's point group ($gW = W$).\n\nThe set of candidate lattice vectors (those satisfying $\\lVert R \\rVert \\le R_{\\text{cut}}$) can be partitioned into disjoint orbits under the action of the point group $G$. An orbit of a vector $R_i$ is the set $\\mathcal{O}_i = \\{g R_i \\mid g \\in G\\}$. The set of all half-spaces defining the WSC can likewise be partitioned according to these orbits. The symmetry-exploiting strategy leverages this by:\n$1$. Selecting a single representative vector from each orbit.\n$2$. For each representative $R_i$, generating the full set of corresponding symmetry-equivalent half-spaces $\\{H_{gR_i} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n$3$. The union of these sets of half-spaces over all unique orbits reconstitutes the complete set of relevant half-spaces, identical to the set used in the naive method.\n\nThe advantage is computational efficiency. Instead of processing every candidate vector individually, we only need to identify the unique orbits. The number of such orbits is typically much smaller than the total number of candidate vectors. For cubic lattices, which possess high symmetry, this reduction is significant.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1$. For each test case (SC, BCC, FCC), define the primitive lattice vectors $a_1, a_2, a_3$.\n$2$. Generate the $24$ rotation matrices of the proper octahedral group $O$.\n$3$. Generate an initial set of lattice vectors $R = n_1a_1 + n_2a_2 + n_3a_3$ for integers $n_i \\in [-N, N]$.\n$4$. Filter these vectors, retaining only unique vectors with norm $\\lVert R \\rVert \\le R_{\\text{cut}}$. This forms the set of $c_t$ candidate vectors.\n$5$. **Naive Method**: Directly use the $c_t$ candidate vectors to define $c_t$ half-spaces of the form $R \\cdot x - \\frac{1}{2} \\lVert R \\rVert^2 \\le 0$. Compute the intersection of these half-spaces to find the vertices of the WSC, and then compute the volume of the resulting convex polyhedron.\n$6$. **Symmetry-Exploiting Method**:\n    a. Partition the $c_t$ candidate vectors into orbits under the group $G$. The number of orbits is $r_t$.\n    b. From these $r_t$ orbits, select one representative vector per orbit.\n    c. Apply all $24$ group operations to these $r_t$ representatives to generate a full set of normal vectors. After deduplication, this set will be identical to the original $c_t$ candidate vectors.\n    d. Construct the half-spaces from this regenerated set and compute the volume as in the naive method.\n$7$. Verify that the volumes from both methods agree within a tolerance of $10^{-9}$. The WSC volume must also agree with the theoretical volume of the primitive cell, $V_{\\text{prim}} = |\\det(a_1, a_2, a_3)|$, which is $1a^3$ for SC, $0.5a^3$ for BCC, and $0.25a^3$ for FCC, where $a$ is the conventional lattice constant. The implementation uses $a=1$.\n$8$.
