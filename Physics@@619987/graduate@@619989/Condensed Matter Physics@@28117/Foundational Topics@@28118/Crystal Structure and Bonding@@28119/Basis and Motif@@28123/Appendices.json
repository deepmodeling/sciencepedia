A crystal structure is obtained by attaching a basis (also called a motif) of atoms to every lattice point. In a body-centered cubic (BCC) Bravais lattice, the conventional cubic description includes lattice points at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$, and the vector $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ (in fractional coordinates of the conventional cubic cell) is itself a lattice translation.

By the definition of a Bravais lattice, all lattice points must be equivalent under pure translations. If the cesium chloride structure were a BCC Bravais lattice, the translation $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ would map a lattice point to an equivalent one and thus force the sites at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ to be chemically identical. Because these sites host distinct species, $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ cannot belong to the translation lattice, so the underlying Bravais lattice is simple cubic with a $2$-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$.\n\nB.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It contains no flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full derivation and evaluation of options will be performed.\n\n**Derivation and Analysis**\n\nThe core a priori principle is the definition of a Bravais lattice: every lattice point is indistinguishable from every other. This means the environment, including the identity of any atom occupying the point, must be identical for all points in the lattice when viewed from any other lattice point. A crystal structure is formed by the convolution of a Bravais lattice with a basis:\n$$\n\\text{Crystal Structure} = \\text{Bravais Lattice} + \\text{Basis}\n$$\nThe CsCl structure consists of two interpenetrating cubic sublattices, one of $\\text{Cs}^+$ ions and one of $\\text{Cl}^-$ ions, shifted relative to each other by the vector $(\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{1}{2})$ in fractional coordinates of the conventional cubic cell of side length $a$. Let us place a $\\text{Cs}^+$ ion at $(0,0,0)$ and a $\\text{Cl}^-$ ion at $(\\tfrac{a}{2}, \\tfrac{a}{2}, \\tfrac{a}{2})$.\n\nHypothesis 1: The Bravais lattice is body-centered cubic (BCC).\nA BCC lattice has lattice points not only at integer coordinates $(n_1, n_2, n_3)a$ but also at half-integer coordinates $(n_1+\\tfrac{1}{2}, n_2+\\tfrac{1}{2}, n_3+\\tfrac{1}{2})a$. This means the positions $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ are both points of the *same* Bravais lattice. By definition, these points must be equivalent. However, in CsCl, one point is occupied by a $\\text{Cs}^+$ ion and the other by a $\\text{Cl}^-$ ion. Since these are different chemical species, the points are not equivalent. Therefore, the vector $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ cannot be a translation vector of the Bravais lattice, and the Bravais lattice cannot be BCC.\n\nHypothesis 2: The Bravais lattice is simple cubic (SC) with a basis.\nAn SC Bravais lattice consists of points at integer coordinates $(n_1, n_2, n_3)a$. The vector $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ is *not* a lattice translation. We can define a $2$-atom basis: {$\\text{Cs}^+$ at $\\mathbf{r}_1=(0,0,0)$, $\\text{Cl}^-$ at $\\mathbf{r}_2=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$}. By placing this basis at every point of the SC lattice, we construct the full CsCl crystal structure. The set of $\\text{Cs}^+$ positions is $\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$ and the set of $\\text{Cl}^-$ positions is $\\{\\mathbf{L} + (\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})\\}$, where $\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$ are the SC lattice vectors. This correctly generates the CsCl structure.\n\nThis proves that the correct description of the CsCl structure is a simple cubic Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. By the definition of a Bravais lattice, all lattice points must be equivalent under pure translations. If the cesium chloride structure were a BCC Bravais lattice, the translation $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ would map a lattice point to an equivalent one and thus force the sites at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ to be chemically identical. Because these sites host distinct species, $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ cannot belong to the translation lattice, so the underlying Bravais lattice is simple cubic with a $2$-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$.\nThis statement is a precise and accurate summary of the reasoning derived above. The argument hinges correctly on the non-equivalence of the $\\text{Cs}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$ sites, which violates the definition of a Bravais lattice if the lattice were assumed to be BCC. The conclusion is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. The coordination number being $8$ excludes any body-centered cubic description, since a body-centered cubic Bravais lattice necessarily has coordination number $6$ like the rock salt structure.\nThis statement contains multiple factual errors. The coordination number (number of nearest neighbors) for an atom in the CsCl structure is indeed $8$. However, the coordination number for a point in a BCC Bravais lattice is also $8$ (the $8$ points at distances of $\\sqrt{3}a/2$). It is not $6$. The coordination number of the rock salt (NaCl) structure is $6$, but rock salt is based on a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice, not BCC. The premise of the argument is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. Because the points at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ are both special Wyckoff positions of the primitive cubic space group $Pm\\overline{3}m$, they are related by a pure translation within that space group, which proves that the translation lattice is body-centered cubic.\nThe space group of CsCl is indeed $Pm\\overline{3}m$ (No. $221$), and the ion positions are the $1a$ Wyckoff site at $(0,0,0)$ and the $1b$ site at $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$. However, the statement that they are \"related by a pure translation within that space group\" is false. The set of pure translations constitutes the Bravais lattice. In a space group with the symbol $P$ (for primitive), there are no non-integer lattice translations like $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$. The inference that this \"proves\" a BCC lattice is a direct contradiction, as the 'P' in $Pm\\overline{3}m$ explicitly denotes a primitive, not body-centered ('I'), lattice. The statement is internally contradictory and factually flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. Attempting to model cesium chloride on a body-centered cubic Bravais lattice with a $2$-atom basis at $\\mathbf{0}$ and $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ fails because $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ is itself a lattice translation of the body-centered cubic lattice. The generated set $\\{\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{0}\\}\\cup\\{\\mathbf{L}+(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})\\}$ equals the same lattice point set $\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$, so every lattice site would be doubly occupied by two different species, which is unphysical. Therefore no two-species basis consistent with a body-centered cubic translation lattice reproduces cesium chloride.\nThis statement presents a rigorous proof by contradiction. Let the BCC lattice points be the set $\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$. By definition, this set is invariant under translation by $\\mathbf{t}=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$, i.e., $\\{\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{t}\\}=\\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$. If we attach a basis of species 1 at $\\mathbf{r}_1=\\mathbf{0}$ and species 2 at $\\mathbf{r}_2=(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$, the positions for species 1 would be $\\{\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{r}_1\\} = \\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$ and for species 2 would be $\\{\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{r}_2\\} = \\{\\mathbf{L}+(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} = \\{\\mathbf{L}\\}$. Thus, both species would occupy the exact same set of sites, which is a physical impossibility. The logic is sound and the conclusion is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nE. If the two species in cesium chloride were identical, the same set of geometric points would constitute a body-centered cubic Bravais lattice. The fact that the two sites are occupied by distinct species prevents $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ from being a translation of the Bravais lattice, so the correct classification is a primitive cubic Bravais lattice with a $2$-atom basis.\nThis statement uses a correct and insightful counterfactual. If both sites were occupied by the same atom type, every site would be equivalent, and the vector $(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2})$ would become a valid lattice translation, making the lattice BCC. It correctly identifies that the chemical difference between the species is the specific reason this translation is forbidden for the Bravais lattice of CsCl.

For the given simple cubic Bravais lattice, the reciprocal lattice is, and remains, a simple cubic lattice. The presence of a motif (the basis atoms) does not alter the definition or the geometric type of the reciprocal lattice points $\\mathbf{G}$.\n\n2.  **Diffraction Selection Rules:** The intensity of a diffracted beam corresponding to a reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G}$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of the structure factor, $I(\\mathbf{G}) \\propto |S(\\mathbf{G})|^2$. The structure factor, which depends on the motif positions $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_j$ and form factors $f_j$, acts as a modulator of the diffraction intensity at each point of the reciprocal lattice. If $S(\\mathbf{G})=0$ for a particular $\\mathbf{G}$, the corresponding diffraction peak is absent. These conditions are known as extinction or selection rules.\n\nFrom the derived structure factor $S(h,k,l) = f_{1} + f_{2}(-1)^{h+k+l}$:\n-   If the sum of Miller indices $h+k+l$ is an **even** integer, then $(-1)^{h+k+l}=1$, and the structure factor is $S(h,k,l) = f_{1} + f_{2}$. The corresponding diffraction peaks are observed with an intensity proportional to $|f_{1} + f_{2}|^2$.\n-   If the sum of Miller indices $h+k+l$ is an **odd** integer, then $(-1)^{h+k+l}=-1$, and the structure factor is $S(h,k,l) = f_{1} - f_{2}$. The corresponding diffraction peaks have an intensity proportional to $|f_{1} - f_{2}|^2$.\n\nA critical special case arises if the two atoms in the motif are identical, meaning $f_{1}=f_{2}=f$. In this scenario:\n-   If $h+k+l$ is even, $S(h,k,l) = f+f = 2f$.\n-   If $h+k+l$ is odd, $S(h,k,l) = f-f = 0$.\n\nIn this specific case, all reciprocal lattice points $(h,k,l)$ for which the sum of indices is odd have zero intensity; they are systematically extinct. The original crystal structure—a simple cubic lattice with a two-atom basis at $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$—is physically a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. The extinction rule $h+k+l=\\text{odd}$ systematically removes reflections, leaving only those for which $h+k+l=\\text{even}$. This is precisely the selection rule for a BCC lattice. The set of surviving reciprocal lattice points forms a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, which is the reciprocal of the BCC lattice.\n\nIn conclusion, the motif does not change the geometric type of the reciprocal lattice (which remains simple cubic), but it imposes selection rules via the structure factor that determine which of these geometric points will produce observable diffraction peaks. For the general case where $f_1 \\neq f_2$ (e.g., the CsCl structure), the odd-indexed reflections are weaker but not fully extinguished, and the underlying simple cubic symmetry of the reciprocal lattice is still observable, albeit with a systematic intensity modulation.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{f_{1} + f_{2}(-1)^{h+k+l}} $$", "id": "2971364"}, {"introduction": "The concepts of basis and structure factor are not merely static descriptions but are crucial for understanding dynamic physical phenomena.

It is scientifically grounded, requires reasoning from first principles, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the formal definitions of a Bravais lattice, a motif (or basis), and the kinematic structure factor to the two phases of the alloy.\n\nA crystal structure is defined by the combination of a Bravais lattice and a motif. The Bravais lattice is an infinite array of points where the environment of any point is identical to the environment of any other point. The motif is the set of atoms located at or around each lattice point.\nCrystal Structure = Bravais lattice + Motif.\n\nThe kinematic structure factor, $F_{hkl}$, for a reflection indexed by $(h, k, l)$ is calculated by summing the scattering amplitudes from all atoms within the motif:\n$$F_{hkl} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} f_j e^{2\\pi i (h u_j + k v_j + l w_j)}$$\nwhere $f_j$ is the atomic scattering factor for the $j$-th atom in the motif, and $(u_j, v_j, w_j)$ are its fractional coordinates within the unit cell. A Bragg reflection is observed only if its corresponding structure factor is non-zero, i.e., $F_{hkl} \\neq 0$.\n\n**Analysis of the Low-Temperature B2 (Ordered) Phase**\n\nIn the B2 phase, species $A$ occupies the conventional cubic cell origin at $(u_A, v_A, w_A) = (0,0,0)$ and species $B$ occupies the body-center at $(u_B, v_B, w_B) = \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$. Since the atoms are chemically distinct ($A \\neq B$), the environment at the origin is not identical to the environment at the body-center. An observer at an $A$ site is surrounded by $B$ atoms, while an observer at a $B$ site is surrounded by $A$ atoms. Therefore, the points $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ are not equivalent and cannot belong to the same Bravais lattice. The highest translational symmetry that maps the entire crystal onto itself is generated by lattice vectors connecting the corner sites. This defines a **primitive cubic Bravais lattice**. The complete structure is formed by placing a **two-atom motif** at each point of this primitive cubic lattice. The motif consists of atom $A$ at $(0,0,0)$ and atom $B$ at $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ relative to the lattice point.\n\nThe structure factor for this B2 phase is:\n$$F_{hkl} = f_A e^{2\\pi i (h \\cdot 0 + k \\cdot 0 + l \\cdot 0)} + f_B e^{2\\pi i (h \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + k \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + l \\cdot \\frac{1}{2})}$$\n$$F_{hkl} = f_A + f_B e^{\\pi i (h+k+l)}$$\nWe analyze the two cases for the sum of Miller indices $h+k+l$:\n1.  If $h+k+l$ is an even integer, $e^{\\pi i (h+k+l)} = 1$, so $F_{hkl} = f_A + f_B$. These are the fundamental reflections.\n2.  If $h+k+l$ is an odd integer, $e^{\\pi i (h+k+l)} = -1$, so $F_{hkl} = f_A - f_B$. These are called superlattice reflections.\n\nFor $(100)$-type reflections, the sum of indices is $1+0+0 = 1$, which is odd. The structure factor is $F_{100} = f_A - f_B$. Since $A$ and $B$ are different species, their scattering factors $f_A$ and $f_B$ are different. Thus, $F_{100} \\neq 0$, and the $(100)$-type reflections are present in the B2 phase.\n\n**Analysis of the High-Temperature A2 (Disordered) Phase**\n\nIn the A2 phase, the sites at $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ are randomly occupied by atoms $A$ and $B$ with equal probability ($50\\%$ each, since the alloy is equiatomic). From the perspective of diffraction, which measures the average structure, every site is now statistically identical. We can define an average atomic scattering factor for each site: $f_{avg} = 0.5 f_A + 0.5 f_B$.\n\nBecause all sites are now equivalent on average, they form a single Bravais lattice. The arrangement of these equivalent sites is that of a **body-centered cubic (BCC) Bravais lattice**. The motif is now a single **one-atom motif** consisting of this \"average atom\". The crystal structure is A2 (BCC).\n\nTo calculate the structure factor, we can use the conventional cubic unit cell of the BCC lattice, which contains two average atoms at $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n$$F_{hkl} = f_{avg} e^{2\\pi i (0)} + f_{avg} e^{2\\pi i (h \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + k \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + l \\cdot \\frac{1}{2})}$$\n$$F_{hkl} = f_{avg} \\left(1 + e^{\\pi i (h+k+l)}\\right)$$\nThis is the standard selection rule for a BCC lattice:\n1.  If $h+k+l$ is an even integer, $F_{hkl} = f_{avg}(1+1) = 2 f_{avg} = f_A + f_B$. Reflections are present.\n2.  If $h+k+l$ is an odd integer, $F_{hkl} = f_{avg}(1-1) = 0$. Reflections are systematically absent.\n\nFor $(100)$-type reflections, $h+k+l=1$ is odd. Therefore, in the A2 phase, $F_{100} = 0$. The $(100)$-type superlattice reflections **disappear** upon transitioning from the ordered B2 phase to the disordered A2 phase.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**\n-   **B2 Phase**: Primitive cubic Bravais lattice, two-atom motif ($A$ and $B$), $(100)$-type reflections are present.\n-   **A2 Phase**: Body-centered cubic Bravais lattice, one-atom motif (average atom), $(100)$-type reflections are absent.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\n**A. In the B2 phase the Bravais lattice is primitive cubic with a two-atom motif at $(0,0,0)$ and $\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2},\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)$ occupied by chemically distinct species; in the A2 phase the Bravais lattice becomes body-centered cubic with a one-atom motif (the two sublattices are equivalent on average). $(100)$-type superlattice reflections are present in B2 and disappear in A2.**\nThis statement accurately describes the Bravais lattice and motif for the B2 phase (primitive cubic, two-atom motif) and the A2 phase (body-centered cubic, one-atom motif). It also correctly predicts that the $(100)$-type superlattice reflections are present in the ordered phase and disappear in the disordered phase. This is fully consistent with our first-principles derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In the B2 phase the Bravais lattice is body-centered cubic with a one-atom motif; in the A2 phase the Bravais lattice is primitive cubic with a two-atom motif. $(100)$-type reflections appear only in A2 due to disorder-enhanced scattering.**\nThis statement incorrectly identifies the Bravais lattices and motifs for both phases, reversing their roles. Furthermore, it incorrectly claims that $(100)$-type reflections appear in the A2 phase, which is the opposite of the derived result.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In the B2 phase the Bravais lattice is body-centered cubic with a two-atom motif; in the A2 phase the motif remains two atoms with equal average scattering on both sites. $(100)$-type reflections remain but with reduced intensity.**\nThis statement incorrectly identifies the B2 Bravais lattice as BCC. If the Bravais lattice is BCC, the motif must comprise objects placed *at* the BCC lattice points; a two-atom motif would imply two atoms per lattice point, which is not the B2 structure. It also incorrectly claims the superlattice reflections remain, whereas the structure factor calculation shows they vanish completely in the fully disordered state.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In the B2 phase the Bravais lattice is primitive cubic with a two-atom motif; in the A2 phase the Bravais lattice remains primitive cubic with a one-atom motif. $(100)$-type reflections are allowed in both phases.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the B2 phase structure but incorrectly describes the A2 phase. If the A2 phase were primitive cubic with a one-atom motif, it would be a simple cubic structure, not BCC (A2). It also incorrectly claims the $(100)$-type reflections are allowed in both phases. They are forbidden in the A2 phase.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2971320"}]}
