The derivation proceeds from first principles, beginning with the quantization of electron wavevectors imposed by periodic boundary conditions.\n\nWe consider a cube of side length $L$ and volume $V = L^{3}$. The periodic boundary conditions require that the electron wavefunction $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ satisfies $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$, and similarly for the $y$ and $z$ coordinates. For a plane wave solution of the form $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})$, this condition implies that $k_x L = 2\\pi n_x$, $k_y L = 2\\pi n_y$, and $k_z L = 2\\pi n_z$, where $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ are integers. The allowed wavevectors are thus quantized:\n$$ \\mathbf{k} = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}(n_x, n_y, n_z) $$\nEach unique triplet of integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ defines a distinct quantum state. These allowed states form a discrete grid in wavevector space (k-space), with adjacent points separated by a distance of $2\\pi/L$ along each axis. The volume in k-space occupied by a single state is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta V_k = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{L^3} = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{V} $$\nIn the limit of a large volume $V$, the discrete states become very dense, and we can treat the distribution of states as a continuum. The number of states $dN_k$ in an infinitesimal volume element $d^3k$ of k-space is given by the ratio of the volume element to the volume per state:\n$$ dN_k = \\frac{d^3k}{\\Delta V_k} = \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} d^3k $$\nAccording to the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. Since electrons are spin-$1/2$ fermions, each $\\mathbf{k}$-state can accommodate two electrons: one with spin up and one with spin down. This introduces a spin degeneracy factor of $g_s = 2$.\n\nAt absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), the system is in its ground state. The electrons fill all the available single-particle energy levels starting from the lowest energy up to a maximum energy, the Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_F$. The single-particle energy is given by $\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar^2 k^2/(2m)$, where $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$. Since the energy depends only on the magnitude of the wavevector, the occupied states in k-space form a sphere of radius $k_F$, known as the Fermi sphere. The Fermi wavevector $k_F$ is defined by $\\varepsilon_F = \\hbar^2 k_F^2/(2m)$.\n\nThe total number of electrons, $N$, can be calculated by integrating the number of available states within the Fermi sphere, multiplied by the spin degeneracy $g_s=2$:\n$$ N = g_s \\int_{k \\le k_F} \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} d^3k = 2 \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} \\int_{k \\le k_F} d^3k $$\nThe integral is simply the volume of the Fermi sphere, which is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$.\n$$ N = 2 \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3\\right) = \\frac{8\\pi V k_F^3}{24\\pi^3} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2} $$\nThe number density of electrons is $n = N/V$.

For the one-dimensional case, the two points of the Fermi surface are perfectly nested. The nesting vector $Q$ is the vector that connects the point $-k_F$ to the point $+k_F$:\n$$\n-k_F + Q = +k_F \\implies Q = 2k_F\n$$\nThus, the nesting vector is $Q = 2k_F$. This perfect nesting means that a perturbation with wavevector $Q=2k_F$ (e.g., a lattice vibration or a periodic potential) can efficiently scatter electrons from occupied states near one Fermi point (e.g., $-k_F$) to unoccupied states near the other (e.g., $+k_F$), leading to a strong response of the system.
