The problem is a standard textbook exercise, scientifically sound within the specified theoretical framework, well-posed, unambiguous, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n_Solution_:\nWe derive the thermal conductivity using a kinetic theory argument. A net transport of thermal energy, which constitutes a heat current, arises in the presence of a temperature gradient. Let the temperature gradient be applied along the $z$-direction, so $\\nabla T = \\frac{dT}{dz}\\hat{z}$.\n\nThe general expression for the flux of a physical property $P$ carried by particles in a gas, according to simple kinetic theory, is given by\n$$J_{P,z} = -\\frac{1}{3} n \\langle v \\rangle \\ell \\frac{dP}{dz}$$\nwhere $n$ is the number density of the carriers, $\\langle v \\rangle$ is their average speed, and $\\ell$ is their mean free path. In our case, the carriers are electrons, the characteristic speed is the thermal speed $v_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and the property being transported is the average thermal energy per electron, $\\epsilon(T)$. The flux of energy is the heat current density, $J_{Q,z}$.\n\nThus, we have\n$$J_{Q,z} = -\\frac{1}{3} n v_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ell \\frac{d\\epsilon}{dz}$$\nWe can express the spatial gradient of energy $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dz}$ in terms of the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dz}$ using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dz} = \\frac{d\\epsilon}{dT} \\frac{dT}{dz}$$\nThe term $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dT}$ represents the heat capacity per electron, which we denote as $c_{v,e}$. This is related to the given heat capacity per unit volume, $C_v$. The total thermal energy per unit volume is $U = n\\epsilon$. Therefore,\n$$C_v = \\frac{dU}{dT} = \\frac{d(n\\epsilon)}{dT} = n \\frac{d\\epsilon}{dT} = n c_{v,e}$$\nThis gives the heat capacity per electron as $c_{v,e} = \\frac{C_v}{n}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the heat current density:\n$$J_{Q,z} = -\\frac{1}{3} n v_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ell \\left(\\frac{C_v}{n}\\right) \\frac{dT}{dz} = -\\frac{1}{3} C_v v_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ell \\frac{dT}{dz}$$\nFor an isotropic medium, this result generalizes to a vector gradient:\n$$\\mathbf{J}_{Q} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{3} C_v v_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ell\\right) \\nabla T$$\nThis is the constitutive relation for the heat current density, which is linear in the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$, as required.\n\nBy comparing this derived relation to Fourier's law, $\\mathbf{J}_{Q} = -\\kappa \\nabla T$, we can identify the thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ as:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{1}{3} C_v v_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ell$$\nNow we substitute the specific expressions given in the problem statement. We are given $C_v = \\frac{3}{2} n k_{B}$ and the mean free path $\\ell = v_{\\mathrm{th}} \\tau$.

This practice [@problem_id:2984819] moves beyond the simple assumption of a single relaxation time to explore how different scattering channels—from static impurities and from thermal lattice vibrations (phonons)—combine to determine the total resistivity. Understanding these concepts is essential for applying Matthiessen's rule and explaining why a metal's resistivity approaches a constant, non-zero \"residual\" value as the temperature approaches absolute zero.", "problem": "A crystalline metal is modeled within the Drude framework, where conduction electrons of density $n$ and effective mass $m$ move under an applied electric field and undergo momentum-relaxing scattering events. Consider two distinct classes of scattering: (i) elastic scattering from static impurities (i.e., quenched disorder) with impurity number density $n_{\\mathrm{imp}}$, and (ii) inelastic scattering from lattice vibrations that are thermally activated. Assume a degenerate electron gas so that transport is dominated by quasiparticles within an energy window of order $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ around the Fermi energy, and work within the relaxation-time picture of momentum dissipation. Starting from Newton’s second law for the average electron drift motion and the principle that independent scattering channels contribute additively to the rate of momentum relaxation, explain why elastic impurity scattering generates a temperature-independent contribution to the electrical resistivity and how this sets a lower bound on the resistivity $\\rho(T)$ at low temperatures.

It correctly outlines the Drude-Sommerfeld model for electron transport in metals, including standard scattering mechanisms and the relaxation time approximation. The principles invoked are scientifically sound.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the Drude model and the relaxation-time approximation. Newton's second law for the average momentum $\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle$ of a conduction electron in an electric field $\\vec{E}$ subject to scattering is\n$$\n\\frac{d\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle}{dt} = -e\\vec{E} - \\frac{\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle}{\\tau}\n$$\nwhere $-e$ is the electron charge and $\\tau$ is the momentum relaxation time. In the steady state ($d\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle/dt = 0$), the average momentum is $\\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle = -e\\tau\\vec{E}$. The drift velocity is $\\vec{v}_d = \\langle \\vec{p} \\rangle / m$, where $m$ is the effective mass. The electrical current density is $\\vec{J} = n(-e)\\vec{v}_d = n(-e)(\\frac{-e\\tau\\vec{E}}{m}) = \\frac{ne^2\\tau}{m}\\vec{E}$.\nFrom Ohm's law, $\\vec{J} = \\sigma\\vec{E}$, we identify the electrical conductivity as\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{ne^2\\tau}{m}\n$$\nThe electrical resistivity $\\rho$ is the inverse of the conductivity:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} = \\frac{m}{ne^2\\tau}\n$$\nThis shows that resistivity is directly proportional to the total scattering rate, $\\Gamma = 1/\\tau$.\n\nThe problem states that independent scattering channels contribute additively to the rate of momentum relaxation. This is known as Matthiessen's Rule. For the two channels given—(i) elastic impurity scattering and (ii) inelastic phonon scattering—the total scattering rate $\\Gamma_{\\text{total}}$ is the sum of the individual rates:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\text{total}} = \\Gamma_{\\text{imp}} + \\Gamma_{\\text{ph}}\n$$\nIn terms of relaxation times, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{imp}}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{ph}}}\n$$\nSince $\\rho \\propto 1/\\tau$, the total resistivity is the sum of the resistivities from each channel:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\rho_{\\text{imp}} + \\rho_{\\text{ph}}(T)\n$$\nNow we analyze the temperature dependence of each contribution.\n(i) **Elastic Impurity Scattering:** Scattering occurs from static, randomly distributed impurities. The scattering potential is fixed in space and time. For a degenerate electron gas, transport is dominated by electrons near the Fermi energy $E_F$. The scattering cross-section from these static defects is largely independent of the electron's energy (in the narrow window around $E_F$) and, crucially, independent of temperature $T$. Therefore, the impurity-limited relaxation time $\\tau_{\\text{imp}}$ is constant. This results in a temperature-independent contribution to resistivity, known as the residual resistivity:\n$$\n\\rho_{0} \\equiv \\rho_{\\text{imp}} = \\frac{m}{ne^2\\tau_{\\text{imp}}}\n$$\n(ii) **Inelastic Phonon Scattering:** Scattering occurs from lattice vibrations, or phonons. The population of phonons is highly dependent on temperature. As $T \\to 0$, the number of thermally excited phonons available to scatter electrons approaches zero. Consequently, the scattering rate from phonons vanishes ($\\Gamma_{\\text{ph}} \\to 0$), the corresponding relaxation time diverges ($\\tau_{\\text{ph}} \\to \\infty$), and the phonon contribution to resistivity goes to zero ($\\rho_{\\text{ph}}(T) \\to 0$).\n\nCombining these facts, the total resistivity at low temperature is\n$$\n\\lim_{T \\to 0} \\rho(T) = \\lim_{T \\to 0} (\\rho_0 + \\rho_{\\text{ph}}(T)) = \\rho_0 + 0 = \\rho_0\n$$\nSince the phonon contribution $\\rho_{\\text{ph}}(T)$ is always non-negative, we have $\\rho(T) \\ge \\rho_0$ for all temperatures. This means the temperature-independent residual resistivity from impurity scattering sets a fundamental lower bound on the resistivity of the metal.\n\nFinally, we discuss the implication for the ratio of thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ to electrical conductivity $\\sigma$. Within the Sommerfeld model for a degenerate electron gas, the thermal conductivity is given by $\\kappa = \\frac{1}{3}C_v v_F^2 \\tau' \\approx \\frac{\\pi^2 n k_B^2 T}{3m}\\tau'$, where $\\tau'$ is the relaxation time relevant for thermal transport. The Wiedemann-Franz law (WFL) relates $\\kappa$ and $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa}{\\sigma T} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi^2 n k_B^2 T}{3m}\\tau'}{(\\frac{ne^2\\tau}{m})T} = \\frac{\\pi^2 k_B^2}{3e^2} \\frac{\\tau'}{\\tau} = L_0 \\frac{\\tau'}{\\tau}\n$$\nwhere $L_0 = \\pi^2 k_B^2 / (3e^2)$ is the Lorenz number. The WFL holds (i.e., the ratio is constant and equal to $L_0$) if the relaxation times for electrical and thermal currents are equal, $\\tau' \\approx \\tau$.\nAs $T \\to 0$, scattering is dominated by elastic collisions with impurities. Elastic collisions are very effective at randomizing the electron's momentum direction, which degrades both charge current (requiring a net flow of charge) and thermal current (requiring a net flow of energy). For purely elastic scattering, and assuming the relaxation time is not strongly energy-dependent near the Fermi level, a more rigorous derivation confirms that $\\tau' \\approx \\tau$. Therefore, in the low-temperature limit where elastic impurity scattering dominates, the Wiedemann-Franz law is expected to hold.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In a degenerate metal with only elastic impurity scattering, the low-temperature electrical resistivity tends to a temperature-independent constant determined by the impurity-limited relaxation time, yielding a residual resistivity $\\rho_{0}$ that persists as $T \\to 0$.**\nThis statement is a direct consequence of our analysis. The scattering rate from static impurities is temperature-independent, leading to a constant resistivity contribution $\\rho_0 = m/(ne^2\\tau_{\\text{imp}})$. As $T \\to 0$, other temperature-dependent scattering mechanisms like phonon scattering \"freeze out,\" leaving only the residual resistivity. Thus, $\\rho(T) \\to \\rho_0$ as $T \\to 0$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because elastic scattering conserves energy, it cannot relax crystal momentum; therefore the electrical resistivity must vanish as $T \\to 0$ even in the presence of static impurities.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Elastic scattering means the kinetic energy of the scattering particle (the electron) is conserved. However, its momentum vector $\\vec{p}$ is changed. An electron with momentum $\\vec{p}_i$ scatters off a static impurity to a final state with momentum $\\vec{p}_f$, where $|\\vec{p}_i| = |\\vec{p}_f|$ but $\\vec{p}_i \\neq \\vec{p}_f$. The change in electron momentum, $\\Delta\\vec{p} = \\vec{p}_f - \\vec{p}_i$, is non-zero and is transferred to the lattice via the impurity. The randomization of the momentum vector is precisely what degrades the electrical current and gives rise to resistivity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. When elastic impurity scattering dominates and the relaxation time is weakly energy dependent near the Fermi level, the Wiedemann–Franz law (WFL) holds as $T \\to 0$, i.e., the ratio $\\kappa / (\\sigma T)$ approaches a constant.**\nAs derived above, the ratio $\\kappa / (\\sigma T)$ is proportional to the ratio of thermal to electrical relaxation times, $\\tau'/\\tau$. In the limit $T \\to 0$, scattering is dominated by elastic impurity scattering. For such scattering, both charge and heat currents are relaxed with nearly the same effectiveness, meaning $\\tau' \\approx \\tau$. Under this condition, the ratio $\\kappa / (\\sigma T)$ approaches the constant Lorenz number, $L_0$. The condition of weak energy dependence of $\\tau$ is a necessary part of the formal derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Adding phonon scattering at finite temperature can only lower the total electrical resistivity below the residual value $\\rho_{0}$, because it opens additional transport channels that assist conduction.**\nThis statement misinterprets the nature of scattering. Scattering mechanisms are sources of resistance that impede conduction; they are not parallel channels that assist it. According to Matthiessen's rule, scattering rates add. Since resistivity is proportional to the scattering rate, the total resistivity is the sum of the individual resistivities: $\\rho(T) = \\rho_0 + \\rho_{\\text{ph}}(T)$. Since $\\rho_{\\text{ph}}(T) \\ge 0$, the addition of phonon scattering at finite temperature *increases* the total resistivity above the residual value $\\rho_0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The Pauli exclusion principle forbids elastic impurity scattering at $T = 0$, implying that the mean free path diverges and there is no residual resistivity.**\nThis is an incorrect application of the Pauli principle. Elastic scattering of an electron on the Fermi surface moves it from an occupied state $\\vec{k}$ to an unoccupied state $\\vec{k}'$ with the same energy. At $T=0$, the Fermi surface is an infinitesimally thin boundary separating a sea of filled states from a continuum of empty states. An electron on the Fermi surface can scatter to any other point on the Fermi surface, all of which are isoenergetic and have available empty states just above them (or are themselves available if we consider the boundary). The Pauli principle does not forbid such transitions; in fact, these are the only transitions possible for low-energy transport processes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. If several independent scattering mechanisms contribute, the total momentum-relaxation rate equals the sum of the individual rates; consequently $\\rho(T) \\ge \\rho_{0}$ for all $T$, with equality achieved only when inelastic channels are frozen out as $T \\to 0$.**\nThis is a correct statement of Matthiessen's rule and its consequences. The additivity of scattering rates ($\\Gamma_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i \\Gamma_i$) implies the additivity of resistivities ($\\rho_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_i \\rho_i$). Let $\\rho_0$ be the temperature-independent resistivity from impurities and $\\rho_{\\text{inelastic}}(T)$ be the sum of all temperature-dependent inelastic contributions (like from phonons). Then $\\rho(T) = \\rho_0 + \\rho_{\\text{inelastic}}(T)$. Since scattering rates are non-negative, $\\rho_{\\text{inelastic}}(T) \\ge 0$. Therefore, $\\rho(T) \\ge \\rho_0$ for all $T$. The equality holds if and only if $\\rho_{\\text{inelastic}}(T) = 0$, which occurs in the limit $T \\to 0$ as inelastic processes are \"frozen out.\"\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACF}$$", "id": "2984819"}, {"introduction": "The simple Drude formula for conductivity, $\\sigma = ne^{2}\\tau/m$, contains a mass term that conceals a great deal of underlying quantum mechanics.

This highlights that mass renormalization inferred from thermodynamics (via the density of states at the Fermi energy) and transport are consistent within the Drude-Sommerfeld picture only when the scattering physics (entering $\\tau$) is properly accounted for; notably, the Lorenz number in the Wiedemann–Franz relation does not depend on $m^{\\ast}$ for energy-independent scattering, so thermal conductivity per unit electrical conductivity remains consistent even with $m^{\\ast} \\neq m_{e}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.6679}$$", "id": "2984829"}]}
