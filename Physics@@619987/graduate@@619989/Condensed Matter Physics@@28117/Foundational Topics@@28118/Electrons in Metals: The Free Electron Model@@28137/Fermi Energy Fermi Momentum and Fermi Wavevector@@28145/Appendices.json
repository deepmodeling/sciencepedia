Solution**\n\nThe solution requires a multi-step calculation starting from the crystallographic data to find the electron number density, which is then used in the free electron model to find the Fermi temperature.\n\nFirst, we determine the number density of conduction electrons, $n$. A face-centered cubic (FCC) conventional unit cell has atoms at its $8$ corners and on its $6$ faces. Each corner atom is shared by $8$ adjacent cells, and each face-centered atom is shared by $2$ adjacent cells. The number of atoms per conventional cell, $N_{\\text{atoms/cell}}$, is therefore:\n$$\nN_{\\text{atoms/cell}} = \\left(8 \\times \\frac{1}{8}\\right) + \\left(6 \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 + 3 = 4\n$$\nThe volume of the conventional cubic cell is $V_{\\text{cell}} = a^3$. Each atom contributes $z=3$ conduction electrons. The total number of conduction electrons in a conventional cell is $N_{\\text{electrons/cell}} = z \\times N_{\\text{atoms/cell}} = 3 \\times 4 = 12$. The electron number density $n$ is the number of electrons per unit volume:\n$$\nn = \\frac{N_{\\text{electrons/cell}}}{V_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{4z}{a^3} = \\frac{12}{a^3}\n$$\n\nNext, we relate the electron density $n$ to the Fermi wavevector $k_F$. In the free electron model at absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), all electron states with wavevectors $\\vec{k}$ such that $|\\vec{k}| \\le k_F$ are occupied. These occupied states form a sphere in $k$-space, the Fermi sphere, with radius $k_F$ and volume $V_k = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$. With periodic boundary conditions on a cube of side length $L$ and volume $V=L^3$, the allowed $k$-states are discrete and occupy a volume of $(2\\pi/L)^3 = (2\\pi)^3/V$ each in $k$-space. The total number of orbital states within the Fermi sphere is the ratio of the sphere's volume to the volume per state:\n$$\nN_{\\text{orbitals}} = \\frac{V_k}{(2\\pi)^3/V} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3}{(2\\pi)^3/V} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2}\n$$\nSince each orbital state can accommodate two electrons of opposite spin ($g_s=2$), the total number of electrons $N_e$ is:\n$$\nN_e = g_s N_{\\text{orbitals}} = 2 \\times \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2}\n$$\nThe electron number density is $n = N_e/V$, which gives the fundamental relation:\n$$\nn = \\frac{k_F^3}{3\\pi^2} \\implies k_F = (3\\pi^2 n)^{1/3}\n$$\n\nThe problem states the energy-wavevector (dispersion) relation is parabolic and isotropic: $E(\\vec{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\vec{k}|^2}{2m_e}$.

In this approximation, this implies $E_0 + t a^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2 = \\text{constant}$, which means $|\\mathbf{k}|^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2 = \\text{constant}$. This is the equation of a circle in the $(k_x, k_y)$ plane centered at the origin. Thus, the constant-energy contours at low energy are circular, confirming the assumption of rotational invariance.\n\nNext, we relate the filling $n$ to the Fermi wavevector $k_F$. At $T=0$, electrons fill all states up to the Fermi energy $E_F$. The set of occupied states forms a Fermi sea. Due to the circular nature of the constant-energy contours, the Fermi surface is a circle of radius $k_F$, centered at the $\\Gamma$ point. The area of the Fermi sea in $k$-space is $A_k = \\pi k_F^2$.\n\nTo count the number of electronic states, we use Born-von Karman boundary conditions for a finite system of real-space area $A_{real} = L \\times L$. These conditions quantize the allowed wavevectors as $k_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_x$ and $k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}n_y$, where $n_x$ and $n_y$ are integers. The area in $k$-space per allowed state is $(\\frac{2\\pi}{L})^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{A_{real}}$. Therefore, the density of states in $k$-space is uniform and equal to $\\frac{1}{4\\pi^2/A_{real}} = \\frac{A_{real}}{4\\pi^2}$.\n\nThe total number of orbital states $N_{k-states}$ within the Fermi sea is the asea of the Fermi sea multiplied by the density of states in $k$-space:\n$$\nN_{k-states} = A_k \\times \\left(\\frac{A_{real}}{4\\pi^2}\\right) = (\\pi k_F^2) \\frac{A_{real}}{4\\pi^2} = \\frac{A_{real} k_F^2}{4\\pi}\n$$\nElectrons are spin-$1/2$ fermions, so each orbital state can accommodate two electrons (one spin-up, one spin-down). The spin degeneracy is $g_s = 2$. The total number of electrons, $N_{elec}$, is:\n$$\nN_{elec} = g_s \\times N_{k-states} = 2 \\times \\frac{A_{real} k_F^2}{4\\pi} = \\frac{A_{real} k_F^2}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThe filling $n$ is defined as the average number of electrons per lattice site. The total number of lattice sites, $N_{sites}$, in a system of area $A_{real}$ with a square lattice of constant $a$ is $N_{sites} = \\frac{A_{real}}{a^2}$. The filling is thus:\n$$\nn = \\frac{N_{elec}}{N_{sites}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N_{elec}$ and $N_{sites}$:\n$$\nn = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{A_{real} k_F^2}{2\\pi}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{A_{real}}{a^2}\\right)}\n$$\nThe real-space area $A_{real}$ cancels, as expected for an intensive quantity:\n$$\nn = \\frac{a^2 k_F^2}{2\\pi}\n$$\nFinally, we solve this equation for the Fermi wavevector $k_F$:\n$$\nk_F^2 = \\frac{2\\pi n}{a^2}\n$$\n$$\nk_F = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi n}{a^2}}\n$$\nFactoring out the $a$ from the square root yields the final expression for the Fermi wavevector at low filling:\n$$\nk_F = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}}{a}\n$$\nThis result is valid as long as the low-energy approximation holds, which requires $k_F a \\ll 1$. Substituting our result, this condition becomes $\\sqrt{2\\pi n} \\ll 1$, which is true for $n \\ll 1/(2\\pi)$. This confirms the self-consistency of the approach.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi n}}{a}}\n$$", "id": "2988932"}]}
