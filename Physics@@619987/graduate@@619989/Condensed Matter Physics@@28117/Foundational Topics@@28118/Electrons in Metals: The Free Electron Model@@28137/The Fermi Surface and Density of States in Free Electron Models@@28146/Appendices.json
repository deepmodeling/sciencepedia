To derive the Fermi surface area $S_F$ in terms of the particle number density $n$, we follow a logical progression based on the quantization of wavevectors under periodic boundary conditions.\n\nFirst, consider a single electron in a cubic box of side length $L$ and volume $V=L^3$. The wavefunction must satisfy periodic boundary conditions:\n$$ \\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z) $$\n$$ \\psi(x, y+L, z) = \\psi(x, y, z) $$\n$$ \\psi(x, y, z+L) = \\psi(x, y, z) $$\nThe single-particle wavefunctions are plane waves of the form $\\psi_{\\mathbf{k}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V}}\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})$, where $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y, k_z)$ is the wavevector. Applying the periodic boundary condition in the $x$-direction, we have:\n$$ \\exp(ik_x(x+L)) = \\exp(ik_x x) $$\nThis implies that $\\exp(ik_x L) = 1$, which requires $k_x L = 2\\pi m_x$ for some integer $m_x$. Similar conditions apply to the $y$ and $z$ directions. Thus, the allowed wavevectors are quantized:\n$$ k_x = \\frac{2\\pi m_x}{L}, \\quad k_y = \\frac{2\\pi m_y}{L}, \\quad k_z = \\frac{2\\pi m_z}{L} $$\nwhere $m_x$, $m_y$, and $m_z$ are integers. These allowed $\\mathbf{k}$ vectors form a simple cubic lattice in $\\mathbf{k}$-space. The spacing between adjacent points is $\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}$ along each axis. The volume in $\\mathbf{k}$-space occupied by a single allowed state (a single point on this lattice) is:\n$$ V_{\\mathbf{k}, \\text{state}} = (\\Delta k)^3 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{L^3} = \\frac{8\\pi^3}{V} $$\n\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), the electrons occupy the lowest available energy states. For a free electron gas, the energy of a state with wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ is $E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m}$, which depends only on the magnitude of $\\mathbf{k}$. Consequently, the occupied states fill a sphere in $\\mathbf{k}$-space, known as the Fermi sphere. The radius of this sphere is the Fermi wavevector, $k_F$. All states with $|\\mathbf{k}| \\le k_F$ are filled, and all states with $|\\mathbf{k}| > k_F$ are empty.\n\nTo find the total number of electrons, $N$, we count the number of available states within the Fermi sphere and multiply by the spin degeneracy, $g_s=2$. The volume of the Fermi sphere is $V_{\\text{Fermi sphere}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$.\nThe total number of allowed orbital states (i.e., distinct $\\mathbf{k}$ vectors) inside the Fermi sphere is the ratio of the sphere's volume to the volume per state:\n$$ N_{\\text{states}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{Fermi sphere}}}{V_{\\mathbf{k}, \\text{state}}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3}{\\frac{8\\pi^3}{V}} = \\frac{4\\pi k_F^3 V}{24\\pi^3} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2} $$\nSince each state can hold two electrons (spin-up and spin-down), the total number of electrons $N$ is:\n$$ N = g_s \\times N_{\\text{states}} = 2 \\times \\frac{V k_F^3}{6\\pi^2} = \\frac{V k_F^3}{3\\pi^2} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the result in terms of the particle number density, $n = N/V$.

For a free electron gas, this is a sphere of radius $k_F$. The surface area of this sphere, $S_F$, is given by the standard formula for the surface area of a sphere:\n$$ S_F = 4\\pi k_F^2 $$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $k_F$ in terms of $n$ into the equation for $S_F$:\n$$ S_F = 4\\pi \\left( (3\\pi^2 n)^{1/3} \\right)^2 $$\nSimplifying the exponent gives the desired final expression for the Fermi surface area as a function of the particle number density:\n$$ S_F = 4\\pi (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3} $$\nThis is a single, simplified closed-form expression for $S_F$ solely in terms of $n$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4\\pi (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3}}$$", "id": "3019072"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational 3D model, we now explore the effects of reduced dimensionality and mass anisotropy, features common in modern materials like semiconductor quantum wells.

We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe system is a two-dimensional electron gas confined to a square area $A = L \\times L$, with periodic boundary conditions imposed at the boundaries. A single-particle state is described by a plane wave $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = C \\exp(i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})$, where $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y)$ is the wavevector. The periodic boundary conditions, $\\psi(x+L, y) = \\psi(x,y)$ and $\\psi(x,y+L) = \\psi(x,y)$, impose quantization on the components of the wavevector.\nFor the $x$-component:\n$$\n\\exp(i k_x (x+L)) = \\exp(i k_x x) \\implies \\exp(i k_x L) = 1\n$$\nThis requires $k_x L = 2\\pi n_x$, where $n_x$ is an integer.
