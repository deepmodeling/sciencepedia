The derivation must proceed from first principles, starting with the counting of quantum states in wavevector space ($\\mathbf{k}$-space).\n\nFirst, we consider electrons confined to a cubic box of side length $L$ and volume $V = L^3$. The imposition of periodic boundary conditions, $\\psi(x+L, y, z) = \\psi(x, y, z)$ and similarly for the $y$ and $z$ directions, discretizes the allowed wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$.

As temperature increases, electrons are thermally excited from states below $\\mu$ to states above $\\mu$. The behavior of $\\mu(T)$ depends on the balance between the number of states available for these excited electrons and the number of states vacated by them (holes).\n\n*   **In 3D**, the DOS, $D_{3}(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\varepsilon^{1/2}$, is a monotonically increasing function of energy. This means that for any energy $\\Delta\\varepsilon$, there are more available states in the energy range $[\\mu, \\mu+\\Delta\\varepsilon]$ than in the range $[\\mu-\\Delta\\varepsilon, \\mu]$. Consequently, when electrons are thermally excited, they populate a region with a higher density of states than the region they vacate. To maintain a constant total particle number, the chemical potential must decrease with temperature. This shifts the Fermi-Dirac distribution to lower energies, reducing the overall particle count to compensate for the fact that excited particles occupy a denser state space. The Sommerfeld expansion shows this leads to a correction proportional to $T^2$ and the slope of the DOS at the Fermi energy, i.e., $\\delta\\mu \\propto -T^2 D'(E_F)/D(E_F)$.\n\n*   **In 2D**, the DOS, $D_{2}(\\varepsilon) = g_0$, is constant. The density of states is perfectly symmetric around any energy value. The number of states available for excited electrons in the energy range $[\\mu, \\mu+\\Delta\\varepsilon]$ is exactly equal to the number of states for holes in the range $[\\mu-\\Delta\\varepsilon, \\mu]$. Particle-hole symmetry holds. As a result, the thermal excitation of electrons is balanced, and to first order, there is no need for the chemical potential to shift to maintain particle number conservation. The $T^2$ term in the Sommerfeld expansion is proportional to $D'(E_F)$, which is zero for the constant $2\\mathrm{D}$ DOS. Higher-order effects lead to a much weaker, exponentially small correction. Our exact solution for 2D, $\\mu(T) = E_{F,2\\mathrm{D}} + k_B T \\ln(1 - \\exp(-E_{F,2\\mathrm{D}}/(k_B T)))$, has a low-temperature expansion $\\mu(T) \\approx E_{F,2\\mathrm{D}} - k_B T \\exp(-E_{F,2\\mathrm{D}}/(k_B T))$, showing exponentially suppressed temperature dependence, far weaker than the $T^2$ power law in 3D.\n\nIn summary, the decreasing chemical potential in $3\\mathrm{D}$ is a result of an increasing DOS with energy, while the nearly constant chemical potential in $2\\mathrm{D}$ is due to a constant DOS.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k_{B} T \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{n}{g_{0} k_{B} T}\\right) - 1\\right)}$$", "id": "2991509"}, {"introduction": "While the Sommerfeld model provides a strong foundation, its predictions for transport properties like the Hall effect often diverge from experimental results.

The total conductivity is the sum of contributions from the electron ($e$) and hole ($h$) bands: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_e + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_h$.\nUsing the simple model results for each band, with carrier densities $n_e, n_h$ and mobilities $\\mu_e = e\\tau_e/m_e^*$, $\\mu_h = e\\tau_h/m_h^*$:\n- Longitudinal conductivity: $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{xx,e} + \\sigma_{xx,h} = n_e e \\mu_e + n_h e \\mu_h$.\n- Transverse (Hall) conductivity: $\\sigma_{xy} = \\sigma_{xy,e} + \\sigma_{xy,h} = (-n_e e \\mu_e^2 + n_h e \\mu_h^2)B_z$.\n\nFor a compensated semimetal, $n_e = n_h = n$. The Hall coefficient is:\n$$ R_H \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_{xy}}{B_z \\sigma_{xx}^2} = \\frac{(-n e \\mu_e^2 + n e \\mu_h^2)B_z}{B_z (n e \\mu_e + n e \\mu_h)^2} = \\frac{1}{ne} \\frac{\\mu_h^2 - \\mu_e^2}{(\\mu_h + \\mu_e)^2} = \\frac{1}{ne} \\frac{\\mu_h - \\mu_e}{\\mu_h + \\mu_e} $$\nThis result depends on the mobilities $\\mu_e$ and $\\mu_h$. Since the problem states they are different, $\\mu_e \\neq \\mu_h$, the term $(\\mu_h - \\mu_e)/(\\mu_h + \\mu_e)$ is not equal to $\\pm 1$. Thus, $R_H$ deviates from the simple value of $1/(ne)$ or $-1/(ne)$. This is a generic consequence of two-carrier transport.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n---\n\n**B. A metal with two electron-like bands crossing the Fermi level, with distinct carrier densities and mobilities, and isotropic, energy-independent relaxation time within each band.**\n\nThis is another case of **multi-band conduction**. Let the two electron bands be denoted by subscripts $1$ and $2$.\n- Longitudinal conductivity: $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{xx,1} + \\sigma_{xx,2} = n_1 e \\mu_1 + n_2 e \\mu_2$.\n- Transverse (Hall) conductivity: $\\sigma_{xy} = \\sigma_{xy,1} + \\sigma_{xy,2} = (-n_1 e \\mu_1^2 - n_2 e \\mu_2^2)B_z$.\n\nThe Hall coefficient in the weak-field limit is:\n$$ R_H \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_{xy}}{B_z \\sigma_{xx}^2} = \\frac{(-n_1 e \\mu_1^2 - n_2 e \\mu_2^2)B_z}{B_z (n_1 e \\mu_1 + n_2 e \\mu_2)^2} = -\\frac{1}{e} \\frac{n_1 \\mu_1^2 + n_2 \\mu_2^2}{(n_1 \\mu_1 + n_2 \\mu_2)^2} $$\nThe simple model applied to the total electron density $n_{tot} = n_1 + n_2$ would give $R_H = -1/((n_1+n_2)e)$. The two expressions are equal only if $n_1 n_2 (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)^2 = 0$, which requires $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2$ (assuming $n_1, n_2 > 0$). The problem specifies \"distinct ... mobilities\", so $\\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$. Therefore, the two-band Hall coefficient generically deviates from the simple single-band formula.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n---\n\n**C. A single, nearly spherical Fermi surface in which the relaxation time $\\tau(\\mathbf{k})$ varies strongly with direction on the Fermi surface due to antiferromagnetic spin-fluctuation “hot spots,” while the band dispersion is otherwise isotropic and parabolic.**\n\nThis scenario describes **anisotropic scattering**. The relaxation time $\\tau$ is not a constant but a function of the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$ on the Fermi surface. For an isotropic band structure, the weak-field Hall coefficient can be shown to be:\n$$ R_H = \\frac{1}{nq} \\frac{\\langle \\tau^2 \\rangle_{FS}}{\\langle \\tau \\rangle_{FS}^2} $$\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_{FS}$ denotes an average over the Fermi surface. For example, $\\langle \\tau \\rangle_{FS} = \\frac{1}{S_{FS}} \\int_{FS} \\tau(\\mathbf{k}) dS$, where $S_{FS}$ is the Fermi surface area.\nBy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, for any function $\\tau(\\mathbf{k})$ that is not constant over the domain of integration (the Fermi surface), the inequality $\\langle \\tau^2 \\rangle_{FS} > (\\langle \\tau \\rangle_{FS})^2$ holds strictly. Therefore, the factor $\\langle \\tau^2 \\rangle_{FS} / \\langle \\tau \\rangle_{FS}^2$ will be greater than $1$. This causes $R_H$ to deviate from the simple value $1/(nq)$. The \"hot spots\" are regions where $\\tau(\\mathbf{k})$ is small, ensuring it varies strongly and making the deviation significant.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n---\n\n**D. A single, closed, parabolic band whose constant-energy surface is an ellipsoid characterized by anisotropic effective masses along the principal axes, with a $k$-independent relaxation time $\\tau$ and measurements performed with current and field along principal axes.**\n\nThis scenario concerns anisotropic band structure, which is a different mechanism from multi-band conduction or anisotropic scattering. Let's analyze its effect. Let the effective mass tensor be diagonal with elements $m_x, m_y, m_z$. With $\\mathbf{E} = E_x\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\mathbf{B} = B_z\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, the weak-field conductivity components are $\\sigma_{xx} = ne^2\\tau/m_x$, $\\sigma_{yy} = ne^2\\tau/m_y$, and $\\sigma_{xy} = B_z ne^3\\tau^2/(m_x m_y)$ for hole-like carriers.\nUsing the general weak-field relation for anisotropic media, $R_H \\approx \\sigma_{xy} / (B_z \\sigma_{xx} \\sigma_{yy})$:\n$$ R_H \\approx \\frac{ B_z n e^3 \\tau^2 / (m_x m_y) }{ B_z (n e^2 \\tau / m_x) (n e^2 \\tau / m_y) } = \\frac{ n e^3 \\tau^2 / (m_x m_y) }{ n^2 e^4 \\tau^2 / (m_x m_y) } = \\frac{1}{ne} $$\nFor this specific configuration (fields along principal axes), the anisotropy of the effective mass does not alter the Hall coefficient from its simple, density-controlled value. Furthermore, this mechanism is band-structure anisotropy, not multi-band conduction or anisotropic scattering as requested.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n**E. A ferromagnetic metal in which skew-scattering and side-jump mechanisms produce a large anomalous Hall effect proportional to the magnetization, even in the absence of an external magnetic field.**\n\nThis option is invalid for two reasons. First, the problem setup explicitly states the material is a \"nonmagnetic metal,\" which directly contradicts this option's premise of a \"ferromagnetic metal.\" Second, the anomalous Hall effect is a distinct physical phenomenon arising from spin-orbit coupling in magnetically ordered materials. It is not a consequence of either multi-band conduction or anisotropic scattering in the sense of the BTE for a nonmagnetic metal. The question is about deviations in the ordinary Hall coefficient within the specified model framework.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n---\n\n**F. A single, spherical, parabolic band with an energy-dependent but direction-independent relaxation time $\\tau(\\varepsilon)$, measured strictly in the degenerate limit $k_B T \\ll E_F$ so that only carriers at $\\varepsilon \\approx E_F$ contribute.**\n\nIn the degenerate limit ($T \\to 0$), the factor $(-\\partial f_0 / \\partial \\varepsilon)$ in the transport integrals, such as for $\\sigma_{ij}$, becomes a Dirac delta function $\\delta(\\varepsilon - E_F)$. This means that all transport properties are determined solely by the values of parameters at the Fermi energy, $E_F$. Any quantity that depends on energy $\\varepsilon$, such as the relaxation time $\\tau(\\varepsilon)$, is effectively evaluated only at $\\varepsilon = E_F$. Therefore, the model behaves as if it had a constant, isotropic relaxation time equal to $\\tau(E_F)$. This leads directly back to the simple model result, $R_H = 1/(nq)$, with no deviation.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2991537"}]}
