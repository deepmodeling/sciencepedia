The argument of the sine in the denominator becomes $(G_x+\\kappa_x)a/2 = \\pi m_x + \\kappa_x a/2$. For small $\\kappa_x$, the denominator is $\\sin^2(\\pi m_x + \\kappa_x a/2) = \\sin^2(\\kappa_x a/2) \\approx (\\kappa_x a/2)^2$. The argument in the numerator is $N_x(G_x+\\kappa_x)a/2 = N_x \\pi m_x + N_x \\kappa_x a/2$. The numerator is $\\sin^2(N_x \\pi m_x + N_x \\kappa_x a/2) = \\sin^2(N_x \\kappa_x a/2)$.\nThe half-maximum condition becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2(N_x \\kappa_x a / 2)}{(\\kappa_x a / 2)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} N_x^2 $$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\sin(N_x \\kappa_x a / 2)}{N_x \\kappa_x a / 2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTaking the square root, and noting that for the central maximum the function is positive:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin(N_x \\kappa_x a / 2)}{N_x \\kappa_x a / 2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThis is a transcendental equation. Let $u = N_x \\kappa_x a / 2$. The equation is $\\frac{\\sin u}{u} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$. As per the problem, we define the dimensionless constant $c$ as the principal non-zero solution to this equation, i.e., $\\frac{\\sin c}{c} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nAt the half-maximum point, we have:\n$$ \\frac{N_x |\\kappa_x^{HM}| a}{2} = c $$\nwhere $\\kappa_x^{HM}$ is the displacement in $q_x$ from the peak center to the half-maximum point. Solving for this displacement:\n$$ |\\kappa_x^{HM}| = \\frac{2c}{N_x a} $$\nThe FWHM is twice this value, as the peak is symmetric about $\\kappa_x=0$:\n$$ \\text{FWHM}_x = 2|\\kappa_x^{HM}| = \\frac{4c}{N_x a} $$\nThis expression explicitly shows that the width of the diffraction peak along the $q_x$ direction scales inversely with the number of unit cells $N_x$ in that direction. This is a classic result known as the Scherrer equation in a more general form.

The intensity ratio is $I_{003}/I_{004} \\approx 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n2.  **Wavelength Dependence**: Changing wavelength from $\\lambda = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ to $\\lambda = 1.01\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ (and retuning $\\theta_B$ for $(0\\,0\\,3)$) causes the spike at $\\phi_\\ast$ to vanish.\n3.  **Thickness Dependence**: Doubling crystal thickness $t$ from $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ to $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ increases the spike intensity by a factor of approximately $4$. In contrast, the intensity of strong allowed reflections increases by a factor of approximately $2$.\n4.  **Temperature Dependence**: Cooling from $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $T = 50\\,\\mathrm{K}$ yields no measurable change in the spike intensity $I_{003}$.\n5.  **Particle Dependence**: A neutron diffraction experiment ($\\lambda_n = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$) detects no $(0\\,0\\,3)$ signal above the noise floor ($I_{003}/I_{004} < 10^{-7}$).\n6.  **Polarization Dependence**: Changes in X-ray polarization do not affect $I_{003}$ within measurement error.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of X-ray diffraction and crystallography. The space group $P4_1 22$ and the associated systematic absence rules for a $4_1$ screw axis are standard concepts. The phenomenon describedâthe appearance of a forbidden reflection under specific geometric conditionsâis realistic and known as the Renninger effect.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed, providing a set of detailed experimental observations and asking for the most consistent physical interpretation from a list of possibilities. The data are sufficient to uniquely identify the correct mechanism.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It describes a classic scenario in X-ray diffraction that requires a careful analysis of competing physical explanations. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to explain the origin of the observed intensity at the $(0\\,0\\,3)$ position, which is a systematically absent reflection for the given space group $P4_1 22$. The structure factor $F_{003}$ is expected to be zero due to the $4_1$ screw symmetry. According to kinematic theory, the intensity is proportional to $|F_{hkl}|^2$, so a direct, single-scattering process should not produce any $(0\\,0\\,3)$ intensity. We must evaluate the proposed mechanisms in light of the six experimental observations.\n\n**A. A genuine symmetry breaking that removes the $4_1$ screw axis, producing an intrinsic nonzero $F_{003}$ and thus a true single-scattering $(0\\,0\\,3)$ reflection.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: If the crystal's true symmetry is lower than $P4_1 22$ and lacks the $4_1$ screw axis, then $F_{003}$ could be intrinsically non-zero.\n    -   (1) A true $(0\\,0\\,3)$ reflection should be observable whenever its Bragg condition is met. Its intensity should not depend on the azimuthal rotation angle $\\phi$ about the scattering vector $\\mathbf{G}_{003}$. The observation of sharp spikes at specific $\\phi$ values decisively contradicts this.\n    -   (3) A single-scattering reflection intensity in the kinematic limit scales with crystal thickness as $I \\propto t$ (for integrated intensity) or $I \\propto t^2$ (for peak intensity in a non-absorbing crystal). The observation that allowed reflections scale as $I_{\\text{allowed}} \\propto t$ (factor of $2$ for doubling $t$) while the forbidden one scales as $I_{003} \\propto t^2$ (factor of $4$ for doubling $t$) indicates that $I_{003}$ does not arise from a single-scattering process.\n    -   (5) The absence of a signal with neutrons is also strong evidence against a simple structural symmetry breaking. A structural change should affect both X-ray and neutron diffraction, unless a highly coincidental cancellation occurs for the neutron scattering lengths.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This hypothesis is inconsistent with observations (1), (3), and (5).\n\n**B. Multiple scattering (Renninger effect) in which two allowed reflections are excited simultaneously and deflect intensity into the nominal $(0\\,0\\,3)$ direction via a two-step diffraction path $\\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{in}} \\to \\mathbf{k}_1 \\to \\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ with net $\\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\mathbf{k}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mathbf{G}_{003}$.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This phenomenon, known as the Renninger effect, involves a detour (Umweganregung) through intermediate Bragg reflections. The net scattering vector is the sum of the reciprocal lattice vectors of the intermediate steps, e.g., $\\mathbf{G}_{003} = \\mathbf{G}_1 + \\mathbf{G}_2$. The example given, $\\mathbf{G}_{(2\\,1\\,1)} + \\mathbf{G}_{(\\bar{2}\\,\\bar{1}\\,2)} = \\mathbf{G}_{(0\\,0\\,3)}$, is a valid pathway.\n    -   (1) For this process to occur, the Ewald sphere must simultaneously intersect the origin ($0$), the final point ($\\mathbf{G}_{003}$), and an intermediate point ($\\mathbf{G}_1$). The instrument is set to ensure the first two intersections. An azimuthal rotation $\\phi$ sweeps the reciprocal lattice, and only at specific angles $\\phi_\\ast$ will a third reciprocal lattice point (like $\\mathbf{G}_{211}$) touch the sphere. This perfectly explains the sharp intensity spikes at specific azimuths.\n    -   (2) The radius of the Ewald sphere is $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$. A small change in $\\lambda$ alters the radius, destroying the sensitive geometric condition for the simultaneous intersection of three points. This explains why the spike vanishes when $\\lambda$ changes.\n    -   (3) The intensity of a two-step process depends on the product of the probabilities of each step. In a simplified model, $I_{\\text{multi-scatter}} \\propto |A_1 A_2|^2$, where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are the scattering amplitudes of the intermediate steps. If a single scattering event's intensity scales as $t$ (as observed for allowed reflections), then its amplitude scales as $t^{1/2}$. A two-step process would have an intensity scaling as $(t^{1/2} \\cdot t^{1/2})^2 = t^2$. If the single scattering intensity scales as $t$, the two step process intensity scales as $I_1 \\times I_2 / I_0 \\propto t \\times t = t^2$. More accurately, the intensity of a double diffraction events is proportional to the product of reflectivities of the intermediate reflections. In the kinematic limit, reflectivity is proportional to thickness, so the intensity is proportional to $t^2$. Doubling $t$ should increase the intensity by a factor of $4$, which matches the observation.\n    -   (4), (5), (6) The other observations are also consistent. The absence of a signal with neutrons is plausible if the intermediate reflections, which are strong for X-rays, happen to be weak for neutrons due to different scattering lengths, or simply because the different wavelength $\\lambda_n$ means the geometric condition is not met. The lack of temperature or polarization dependence might be an oversimplification in the problem statement, but it does not fatally contradict this hypothesis, especially compared to the definite contradictions for other options.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This hypothesis is consistent with all experimental data, providing a compelling explanation for the most distinctive features: the sharp azimuthal dependence, the sensitivity to wavelength, and the quadratic thickness dependence.\n\n**C. Instrumental resolution tails from nearby strong reflections bleeding into the $(0\\,0\\,3)$ detector channel regardless of azimuth or sample thickness.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: This suggests that the detector, set for $(0\\,0\\,3)$, is picking up intensity from the tails of a nearby, strong reflection.\n    -   (1) If this were the case, the intensity should be present whenever the nearby strong reflection is excited. It would not appear as sharp spikes during an azimuthal scan at a fixed detector position, unless the scan itself brings another strong reflection into the detector, which is not the scenario described. The effect should be smooth, not spike-like at a specific $\\phi_\\ast$.\n    -   (3) The intensity of the tail should be proportional to the intensity of the parent peak. Since strong allowed reflections have intensity scaling as $I \\propto t$, the tail intensity should also scale as $t$, not $t^2$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This hypothesis is inconsistent with observations (1) and (3).\n\n**D. Resonant X-ray scattering near an absorption edge that relaxes selection rules, giving weak $(0\\,0\\,3)$ intensity independent of azimuth but strongly dependent on photon energy and polarization.**\n\n-   **Analysis**: When the X-ray energy is tuned near an atomic absorption edge, the atomic form factor becomes a complex, energy-dependent tensor. This can lead to the violation of systematic absence rules.\n    -   (1) Like genuine symmetry breaking, this is a single-scattering process. The intensity should be observable whenever the Bragg condition for $(0\\,0\\,3)$ is satisfied and should be independent of the azimuthal angle $\\phi$. The observation of sharp spikes at specific $\\phi$ values contradicts this.\n    -   (3) As a single-scattering process, the intensity should scale with thickness as $I \\propto t$, not $t^2$.\n    -   (6) Resonant scattering is known for its strong dependence on X-ray polarization. The scattering intensity can depend critically on the orientation of the polarization vector relative to the crystal axes. The observation that polarization changes do *not* affect the intensity is a very strong argument against this hypothesis.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This hypothesis is decisively ruled out by observations (1), (3) and (6).\n\nFinal Conclusion: The experimental dataset, particularly the sharp azimuthal dependence, extreme wavelength sensitivity, and quadratic thickness dependence, provides a classic signature of the Renninger effect, a multiple-scattering phenomenon.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2981811"}]}
