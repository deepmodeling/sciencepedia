The process is initiated when the applied resolved shear stress on the twinning system reaches a critical value, $\\tau_{total}$. This critical stress is influenced by the intrinsic properties of the crystal lattice and by the presence of defects.\n\nNeutron irradiation from the fusion plasma creates a high density of defects, predominantly in the form of small dislocation loops. These loops act as obstacles to the motion of twinning dislocations, thereby increasing the stress required to initiate twinning.

The intrinsic critical resolved shear stress for twinning in a defect-free crystal is a constant, $\\tau_0$.\n2.  Irradiation has produced a uniform, random distribution of circular dislocation loops of a single diameter $d$ and a volume number density $N$.\n3.
