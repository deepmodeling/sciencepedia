This can be achieved through two main schemes: direct drive and indirect drive.\n\nIn the direct-drive (DD) scheme, laser beams directly illuminate the capsule. The ablation pressure, $P_{DD}$, generated at the start of the implosion (the \"foot\" pulse) is empirically related to the absorbed laser intensity, $I_a$, and the laser wavelength, $\\lambda_L$, by the scaling law:\n$$P_{DD} = C_{DD} \\left(\\frac{I_a}{\\lambda_L}\\right)^{2/3}$$\nThe absorbed intensity is a fraction $\\eta_a$ of the incident laser intensity $I_L$, so $I_a = \\eta_a I_L$. The total incident laser power on the capsule is $W_{L,DD} = I_L A$, where $A$ is the capsule surface area.\n\nIn the indirect-drive (ID) scheme, lasers heat a high-Z cavity (a hohlraum), which then bathes the capsule in a nearly uniform field of thermal x-rays. The hohlraum is characterized by a radiation temperature, $T_r$. The ablation pressure generated during the foot pulse in this case is given by the scaling law:\n$$P_{ID} = C_{ID} T_r^{7/2}$$\nHere, $C_{DD}$ and $C_{ID}$ are constants that depend on the ablator material and have units that make the equations dimensionally consistent.\n\nConsider an experimental design where we want to launch an initial shock of the same pressure $P_0$ into an identical ablator using either the direct-drive or indirect-drive method.

The goal is to compress the main fuel on a low adiabat (a measure of entropy) to maximize its density, and thus the fusion yield.

A first shock sets an initial adiabat. A second, stronger shock is launched at a later time $t_s$. An error in the laser system causes this launch time to shift by a small amount $\\delta t$.\n\n1.  **Final Adiabat:** The final adiabat of the fuel, $\\alpha_f$, is determined by the strength of the second shock.
