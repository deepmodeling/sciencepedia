By solving this problem [@problem_id:319727], you will uncover a critical link between initial target quality and the stability of the final hot spot.", "problem": "Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) aims to compress and heat a small fuel capsule to ignition conditions. A typical direct-drive capsule consists of a spherical shell of cryogenic deuterium-tritium (DT) ice. The implosion process can be broadly divided into three phases: acceleration, coasting, and deceleration. During the deceleration phase, the kinetic energy of the incoming dense shell is converted into the internal energy of a central low-density, high-temperature \"hot spot\". This phase is hydrodynamically unstable to the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI), as the low-density hot spot gas decelerates the high-density shell.\n\nInitial imperfections on the capsule, such as non-uniformities in its thickness, can \"feed through\" the implosion and act as seeds for this dangerous deceleration-phase RTI. A larger seed amplitude leads to more rapid instability growth, which can disrupt the hot spot and quench ignition.\n\nConsider a simplified model for this seeding process. A spherical shell of initial uniform density $\\rho_s$ has a uniform outer radius $R_o$. Its initial thickness, however, is non-uniform and described by a single Legendre mode $l$ as:\n$$\n\\Delta R(\\theta) = \\Delta R_o + \\delta R P_l(\\cos\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta R_o$ is the mean initial thickness, $\\delta R$ is the initial perturbation amplitude ($\\delta R \\ll \\Delta R_o$), and $\\theta$ is the polar angle. We assume this thickness variation is entirely due to a perturbation on the inner surface.\n\nThe shell is imploded. By the time the shell reaches its peak velocity just before the deceleration phase, it has a mean inner radius of $R_h$ and its material possesses a uniform inward velocity $v_{imp}$. The central hot spot has formed and exerts a uniform pressure $P_h$ on the inner surface of the shell, causing it to decelerate.\n\nAssume that mass is conserved in spherical cones (i.e., no lateral mass flow during the acceleration) and that the shell is thin, allowing the initial mass per unit solid angle, $\\Sigma_0(\\theta)$, to be approximated as:\n$$\n\\Sigma_0(\\theta) \\approx \\rho_s R_o^2 \\Delta R(\\theta)\n$$\n\nThe deceleration of any given segment of the shell depends on its local areal density. This differential deceleration causes the more massive parts of the shell to coast further inward before stopping compared to the less massive parts.
