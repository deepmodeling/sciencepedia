The instability is driven by the passage of a shock wave through an interface between two fluids with different densities. The subsequent growth of perturbations is characterized by the post-shock Atwood number, $A^* = (\\rho_2^* - \\rho_1^*) / (\\rho_2^* + \\rho_1^*)$, where $\\rho_1^*$ and $\\rho_2^*$ are the fluid densities immediately after the shock interaction. A particularly interesting phenomenon is phase inversion, where the perturbation's spatial phase is flipped. A critical condition often associated with the onset of phase inversion is the vanishing of the post-shock Atwood number, $A^*=0$, which implies $\\rho_1^* = \\rho_2^*$.\n\nConsider an interface separating two distinct materials. Material 1 is an ideal gas with a constant adiabatic index $\\gamma_1$. Material 2 is a dense plasma whose pressure is dominated by a fully degenerate, non-relativistic electron gas; this material can be accurately modeled as a polytropic gas with an effective adiabatic index $\\gamma_2$. Initially, both materials are at rest and in pressure equilibrium at $P_0$, with initial densities $\\rho_{1,0}$ and $\\rho_{2,0}$. A strong shock system, driven by the implosion, propagates through the interface, compressing both fluids to a much higher, uniform pressure $P$.\n\n**Problem Statement:** Assume that the final (post-shock) densities, $\\rho_1^*$ and $\\rho_2^*$, can be determined from their respective initial states using the Rankine-Hugoniot relation for a single shock transition from pressure $P_0$ to $P$. Derive the critical initial density ratio, $\\frac{\\rho_{2,0}}{\\rho_{1,0}}$, for which the post-shock Atwood number is zero.
