In a vacuum, it is a stable, weakly-bound system. The energy required to detach the second, outer electron is its binding energy, which we denote as $W$.

The boundary in phase space between trapped and untrapped orbits is the separatrix. The classical trapping width is defined as the full range of velocities, $2\\Delta v_{cl}$, that a particle at the bottom of a potential well can have and still be trapped.

A key effect is that a confined particle cannot have zero kinetic energy. This \"zero-point energy\" effectively raises the minimum energy of a trapped particle, making it easier for it to escape. This effect can be described by adding a quantum potential, the Bohm potential, to the classical potential.\n\nAssume that the dominant quantum correction to the trapping width arises from the zero-point energy of the electron in the potential well.
