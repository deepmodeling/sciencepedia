This practice explores the coupled oscillations of a dust particle levitated in a plasma sheath, a scenario central to many laboratory experiments. By analyzing its motion, you will discover how the anisotropic plasma environment, particularly the ion wakefield, not only confines the particle but also inextricably links its movements in different directions, leading to distinct normal modes of oscillation [@problem_id:298658].", "problem": "A single spherical dust grain of mass $M_d$ is levitated in the sheath of a DC glow discharge plasma. The strong vertical electric field in the sheath, combined with gravity, provides confinement in the vertical ($z$) direction. A downward flow of positive ions past the negatively charged dust grain creates a positively charged region, known as an ion wake, directly below the particle. This wake provides confinement in the horizontal ($x$) direction.\n\nDue to the complex, asymmetric structure of the ion wakefield, the particle's horizontal and vertical motions are coupled. For small displacements $(x, z)$ from its stable equilibrium position (which we define as the origin), the potential energy of the dust grain can be approximated by:\n$$U(x, z) = \\frac{1}{2} k_x x^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k_z z^2 + \\alpha x z$$\nHere, $k_x$ and $k_z$ are the effective spring constants for the horizontal and vertical confinement, respectively. The parameter $\\alpha$ is the coupling constant that arises from the ion wake. Assume $k_x$, $k_z$, and $\\alpha$ are positive real constants. We neglect any damping effects.\n\nThe coupling gives rise to two normal modes of oscillation with distinct eigenfrequencies, $\\omega_+$ and $\\omega_-$ (with $\\omega_+ > \\omega_-$).
