The plasma consists of positive and negative ions, both with mass $m_i$ and charge magnitude $q$.

The positive and negative ion populations are assumed to have the same uniform temperature, $T$. The system is in a state of magnetohydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nThe following assumptions are made:\n1.  The plasma is perfectly quasi-neutral, with equal number densities for the positive and negative ions: $n_+(z) = n_-(z) = n(z)$. The total plasma pressure is therefore given by $P(z) = 2n(z)k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n2.  The current density supporting the magnetic field reversal is directed along the y-axis. It is carried by the relative drift of the ion species and is proportional to the local ion density: $J_y(z) = 2 q U n(z)$. Here, $U$ is a constant parameter representing the effective relative drift speed.\n3.  The boundary conditions are set far from the current sheet (as $z \\to \\pm\\infty$), where the ion density vanishes, $n(z) \\to 0$, and the magnetic field approaches a constant magnitude, $\\lim_{z\\to\\pm\\infty} B_x(z) = \\pm B_0$.\n4.
