For the parametric decay process described, the Manley-Rowe relations imply that for every quantum of the pump wave that is annihilated, one quantum of the Langmuir wave and one quantum of the ion-acoustic wave are created. This means the rate of change of the action density is the same for both daughter waves.\n\nAssuming the two daughter waves grow from negligible initial energy densities, derive the ratio of the energy density of the daughter Langmuir wave, $U_1$, to the energy density of the daughter ion-acoustic wave, $U_2$.
