In this model, the Earth is a perfect sphere of radius $R_E$, and its magnetic field is generated by a magnetic dipole of moment $\\vec{M}$. The dipole is displaced from the Earth's geocenter by a constant vector $\\vec{d}$.\n\nThe minimum magnetic field intensity on the Earth's surface occurs at a point we designate as $P_S$.
