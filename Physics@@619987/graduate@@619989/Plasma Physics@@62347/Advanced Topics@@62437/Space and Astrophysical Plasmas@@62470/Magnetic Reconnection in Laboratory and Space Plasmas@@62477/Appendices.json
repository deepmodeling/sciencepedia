This instability fragments the sheet into a chain of magnetic islands, or plasmoids, separated by shorter, secondary current sheets. A heuristic criterion for the onset of this instability is that the formation time of these plasmoids must be shorter than the time it takes for them to be flushed out of the main current sheet by the Alfvénic outflow.\n\nThe problem requires you to use the following physical model:\n\n1.
