The flux rope is characterized by a time-dependent major radius $R_c(t)$ (distance from the Sun's center to the geometric center of the torus cross-section) and a time-dependent minor radius $a(t)$.\n\nWithin this model, the toroidal magnetic field component $B_t$ at a cylindrical distance $r_{cyl}$ from the main axis of the torus is given by\n$$B_t(r_{cyl}, t) = B_{t,c}(t) \\frac{R_c(t)}{r_{cyl}}$$\nwhere $B_{t,c}(t)$ is the toroidal field strength at the center of the torus cross-section (where $r_{cyl} = R_c(t)$).\n\nAs the CME propagates outwards, the flux rope expands. Observations suggest that the expansion is not necessarily self-similar.

The derivation is based on the conservation of toroidal magnetic flux $\\Psi_t$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the toroidal magnetic flux $\\Psi_t$.**\n\nThe toroidal magnetic flux is the integral of the toroidal magnetic field $B_t$ over the circular cross-section of the torus, which has area $A = \\pi a^2$. We use local polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta)$ centered on the axis of the minor cross-section, such that a point in the cross-section has a cylindrical distance from the main torus axis of $r_{cyl} = R_c + \\rho \\cos\\theta$.
