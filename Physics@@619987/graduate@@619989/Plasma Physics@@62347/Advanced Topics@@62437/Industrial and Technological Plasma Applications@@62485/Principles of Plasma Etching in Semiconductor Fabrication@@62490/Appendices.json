The reactor is highly asymmetric, with the area of the powered RF electrode, $A_{p}$, being much smaller than the area of the grounded chamber walls. This asymmetry leads to the development of a significant negative DC self-bias voltage, $V_{dc}$, on the powered electrode, which is crucial for accelerating ions toward the wafer.\n\nA simplified model is adopted to analyze the power balance in the sheath of the powered electrode, based on the following assumptions:\n1.  The total RF power absorbed by the plasma, $P_{abs}$, is dominantly dissipated by the kinetic energy of ions bombarding the powered electrode. Power dissipated at the grounded walls is considered negligible.\n2.  The energy gained by each ion is determined by the magnitude of the DC self-bias voltage, $|V_{dc}|$.\n3.  The ion flux to the electrode is governed by the Bohm criterion. The ion current density at the sheath edge is $J_{ion} = e n_s u_B$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $n_s$ is the plasma density at the sheath edge, and $u_B$ is the Bohm speed.\n4.  The Bohm speed is given by $u_B = \\sqrt{k_B T_e / m_i}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_e$ is the electron temperature, and $m_i$ is the ion mass.\n\nTwo different etching processes are compared. The first process uses argon (Ar) gas, producing Ar$^+$ ions of mass $m_{Ar}$. The second process uses hydrogen (H) gas, producing H$^+$ ions of mass $m_H$. For both processes, the absorbed power $P_{abs}$, the sheath-edge plasma density $n_s$, and the electron temperature $T_e$ are maintained at the same constant values.\n\nBased on this model, derive a symbolic expression for the ratio of the magnitudes of the DC self-bias voltages for the two plasmas, $\\frac{|V_{dc, Ar}|}{|V_{dc, H}|}$.", "solution": "1.

This practice delves into the mechanism of anisotropic etching by modeling the formation of a protective passivation layer on the wafer surface. You will derive the steady-state surface coverage by balancing the rates of deposition and ion-assisted sputtering, providing insight into how a directional etch is achieved and maintained [@problem_id:321338].", "problem": "In anisotropic plasma etching, a key process for fabricating high-aspect-ratio features in semiconductor devices, the vertical etch rate is enhanced relative to the lateral etch rate. This is often achieved by forming a passivation layer on all surfaces exposed to the plasma. While this layer protects the feature sidewalls from lateral etching by neutral radicals, it is continuously removed from the bottom surface by energetic, vertically incident ions, allowing the etch to proceed downwards.\n\nConsider a simple model for the surface kinetics of such a passivation layer on a substrate. The surface consists of a fixed number of sites, and we define $\\theta$ as the fraction of these sites covered by the passivant. The remaining fraction, $(1-\\theta)$, represents the bare substrate. The evolution of $\\theta$ is governed by a competition between deposition and removal processes.\n\nThe deposition of the passivant occurs through two parallel mechanisms:\n1.  **Spontaneous Deposition:** Neutral passivating species from the plasma, with a flux $\\Gamma_p$, stick to bare surface sites with an intrinsic sticking coefficient $s_0$. The rate of coverage due to this process is proportional to $\\Gamma_p$, $s_0$, and the fraction of bare sites.\n2.  **Ion-Activated Deposition:** Energetic ions, with flux $\\Gamma_i$, strike bare surface sites, creating activated, highly reactive sites with a yield $Y_a$ (number of activated sites created per incident ion). It is assumed these activated sites are instantaneously occupied by a passivating particle. The rate of coverage due to this process is proportional to $\\Gamma_i$, $Y_a$, and the fraction of bare sites.\n\nThe removal of the passivant occurs through one primary mechanism:\n1.  **Ion Sputtering:** Energetic ions from the same flux $\\Gamma_i$ strike passivant-covered sites, physically sputtering away the passivant molecules with a yield $Y_s$ (number of passivant molecules removed per incident ion). The rate of removal is proportional to $\\Gamma_i$, $Y_s$, and the fraction of covered sites.\n\nAssuming the system reaches a dynamic equilibrium, or steady state, where the total rate of deposition equals the rate of removal, derive a closed-form expression for the steady-state fractional surface coverage of the passivant, $\\theta_{ss}$.

A key aspect of these processes is the competition between etching by fluorine (F) atoms and polymerization by fluorocarbon radicals (e.g., $CF_2$). The balance between these two effects determines whether there is net etching of the substrate or net deposition of a fluorocarbon polymer film. A transition from etching to polymerization occurs at a critical feed gas composition.\n\nConsider a simplified zero-dimensional (global) model for a capacitively coupled plasma reactor operating with a mixture of two feed gases: a fluorine-rich etchant precursor, $G_E$, and a carbon-rich polymerizing precursor, $G_P$. Let the composition of the feed gas be described by the mole fraction of the polymerizing precursor, $\\chi = \\frac{P_{G_P}}{P_{total}}$, where $P_{G_P}$ is the partial pressure of $G_P$ and $P_{total}$ is the fixed total pressure in the reactor.\n\nThe model makes the following assumptions:\n1.  The steady-state number density of fluorine etchant atoms, $[F]$, is directly proportional to the mole fraction of the etchant precursor gas. Thus, $[F] = \\alpha(1-\\chi)$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant representing the effective generation rate of F atoms.\n2.  The steady-state number density of the primary polymerizing radical, $CF_2$, is directly proportional to its precursor's mole fraction. Thus, $[CF_2] = \\beta\\chi$, where $\\beta$ is a positive constant for the effective generation rate of $CF_2$ radicals.\n3.  A thin fluorocarbon polymer film forms on the substrate surface. The fraction of the surface covered by this film is denoted by $\\theta$, where $0 \\le \\theta \\le 1$.\n4.  The rate of polymer film growth, $R_{growth}$, is proportional to the density of $CF_2$ radicals and is assumed to be independent of the existing surface coverage. It is given by $R_{growth} = s [CF_2]$, where $s$ is an effective deposition coefficient.\n5.  The polymer film is simultaneously etched by fluorine atoms. The rate of polymer removal, $R_{removal}$, is proportional to the density of F atoms and the fractional area covered by the polymer. This rate is given by $R_{removal} = k [F] \\theta$, where $k$ is an effective etch rate coefficient for the polymer.\n6.  The system reaches a steady state where the polymer coverage $\\theta$ is constant, which occurs when the growth rate equals the removal rate, $R_{growth} = R_{removal}$.\n7.
