The thrust, $T$, is generated by the electrostatic acceleration of ions of mass $M$ and elementary charge $e$. It is given by $T = I_b \\sqrt{2 M V_{acc} / e}$, where $I_b$ is the ion beam current and $V_{acc}$ is the effective accelerating voltage. The thruster consumes a total input power $P_{in} = I_d V_d$, where $V_d$ is the discharge voltage and $I_d$ is the discharge current. The discharge current is composed of the useful ion beam current and a parasitic electron current to the anode, $I_e$, such that $I_d = I_b + I_e$.
