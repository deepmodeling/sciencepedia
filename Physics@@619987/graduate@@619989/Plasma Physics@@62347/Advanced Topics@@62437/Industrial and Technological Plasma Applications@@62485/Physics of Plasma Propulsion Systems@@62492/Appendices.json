The ionization process is imperfect in two ways. First, not all propellant atoms are ionized.

The thruster operates with a fixed anode-cathode potential difference, known as the acceleration voltage $V_a$, and is supplied with a fixed total discharge power $P_d$.\n\nThe thrust, $T$, is generated by the electrostatic acceleration of singly charged ions and is given by the formula:\n$$\nT = I_b \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m V_a}{e}}\n$$\nwhere $I_b$ is the ion beam current, $m$ is the mass of a single propellant atom, and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe thruster's performance is governed by the following idealized model:\n1.  The total discharge current $I_d$ drawn from the power supply is the sum of the ion beam current $I_b$ and an electron current $I_e$ that flows from the cathode to the anode.\n2.  The power associated with this electron current, $P_e = I_e V_a$, is assumed to be entirely consumed in the process of ionizing the neutral propellant gas.\n3.  The total power required to create the ions in the beam is $P_{ion} = (I_b/e) \\mathcal{E}_c$, where $\\mathcal{E}_c$ is the effective energy cost to produce a single ion-electron pair in the plasma. This cost is higher than the simple ionization potential due to other energy loss channels like atomic excitation.\n4.  The effective ionization cost $\\mathcal{E}_c$ is modeled as being directly proportional to the first ionization potential of the propellant atom, $\\epsilon_{ion}$, such that $\\mathcal{E}_c = C \\epsilon_{ion}$. The factor $C$ is a constant determined by the thruster's design and is independent of the propellant used.\n\nBy equating the power consumed for ionization with the power supplied by the electron current ($P_e = P_{ion}$), one can relate the beam current $I_b$ to the total discharge current $I_d$. Since the thruster is operated at constant discharge power $P_d = I_d V_a$ and constant voltage $V_a$, the total discharge current $I_d$ is the same for both propellants.\n\nYou are given the following symbolic parameters:\n-   Atomic mass of Krypton: $m_{Kr}$\n-   Atomic mass of Xenon: $m_{Xe}$\n-   First ionization potential of Krypton: $\\epsilon_{ion,Kr}$\n-   First ionization potential of Xenon: $\\epsilon_{ion,Xe}$\n-   Fixed acceleration voltage: $V_a$\n-   Thruster ionization cost factor: $C$\n-   Elementary charge: $e$\n\nDerive an expression for the ratio of the thrust produced using Krypton to the thrust produced using Xenon, $\\frac{T_{Kr}}{T_{Xe}}$.", "solution": "1.

The accelerator grid, held at a large negative potential, is subject to heating from impinging charge-exchange (CEX) ions. This heating causes the grid to thermally expand. As the grid is fixed at its periphery, this expansion results in the grid buckling or bowing towards the screen grid. If the deflection becomes too large, it will contact the screen grid, causing an electrical short and catastrophic failure of the thruster.\n\nConsider the accelerator grid to be a thin, uniform, solid circular plate of radius $R$ and thickness $h$. The grid is made of a material with density $\\rho$, specific heat capacity $c_p$, and coefficient of linear thermal expansion $\\alpha_L$. The grid is rigidly clamped at its edge (at radius $R$). The initial temperature of the grid is uniform and the grids are perfectly flat, separated by a gap $d_0$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the thruster begins operation, and a constant CEX ion current, $I_{grid}$, strikes the accelerator grid.

Assume this heating is distributed uniformly. For the relatively short operational times considered, you may neglect any heat loss from the grid due to radiation or conduction.\n\nThe thermal expansion of the clamped grid causes it to deflect.
