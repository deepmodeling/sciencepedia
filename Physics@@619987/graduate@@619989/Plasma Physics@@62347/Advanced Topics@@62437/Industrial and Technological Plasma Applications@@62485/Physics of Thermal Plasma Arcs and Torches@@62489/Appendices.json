In many practical applications, such as arc welding or plasma torches, the arc is operated in a regime where it displays a negative differential resistance (NDR), meaning the voltage across the arc decreases as the current increases. This property can lead to instabilities in the electrical circuit driving the arc.\n\nConsider a simple model for a DC arc circuit. A DC voltage source provides power to an arc. To limit the current, a ballast resistor with resistance $R_b$ is placed in series with the arc. The circuit wiring and the ballast resistor itself possess a non-negligible total inductance $L$. Furthermore, stray capacitance and the inter-electrode capacitance of the arc itself can be modeled as a single capacitor $C$ in parallel with the arc. The resulting circuit schematic is a DC source feeding a series R-L circuit, which in turn drives a parallel combination of the arc and the capacitor C.\n\nFor small perturbations around a steady-state DC operating point $(I_{a0}, V_{a0})$, the arc's dynamic behavior can be modeled by a constant negative differential resistance, $r_d = dV_a/dI_a < 0$. When the circuit parameters are in a certain range, the system can become unstable to small perturbations, leading to large, sustained oscillations. This is known as oscillatory instability.\n\nThe onset of this instability occurs at the threshold of marginal stability, where perturbations neither decay nor grow, but oscillate at a specific natural frequency. Assuming the circuit parameters ($R_b, L, C$) and the arc's operating point are such that the instability is oscillatory in nature, derive the angular frequency, $\\omega$, of these nascent oscillations.
