Consider a simplified one-dimensional model of a slab plasma confined between two parallel plates. The plasma has a thickness $L$. The substrate is located at $x=0$, and a second, inert wall is at $x=L$.\n\nWithin the plasma volume ($0 < x < L$), a single type of radical is generated uniformly at a constant rate $G_0$ (number of particles per unit volume per unit time). The transport of these radicals is governed by diffusion, with a constant diffusion coefficient $D$. We assume the system is in a steady state and that there are no gas-phase reactions that consume the radicals. The steady-state diffusion equation for the radical number density $n(x)$ is therefore:\n$$D \\frac{d^2 n(x)}{dx^2} + G_0 = 0$$\n\nThe boundary conditions are defined as follows:\n1.  The substrate at $x=0$ is a perfect sink for the radicals, meaning any radical reaching it is immediately absorbed. This is modeled by the condition $n(0) = 0$.\n2.  The wall at $x=L$ is perfectly reflecting, meaning there is no net flux of radicals into this wall.\n\nThe particle flux, $\\Gamma(x)$, is given by Fick's first law: $\\Gamma(x) = -D \\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$.\n\nDerive an expression for the magnitude of the steady-state particle flux onto the substrate, $\\Gamma_s$, located at $x=0$.", "solution": "We seek the steady‐state solution of  \n$$D\\frac{d^2n}{dx^2}+G_0=0\\,,\\quad0<x<L$$  \nIntegrate once:  \n$$D\\frac{dn}{dx}=-G_0x+C_1$$  \nIntegrate again:  \n$$n(x)=-\\frac{G_0}{2D}x^2+\\frac{C_1}{D}x+C_2$$  \nApply $n(0)=0\\implies C_2=0$.
