This exercise explores the fundamental concept of particle balance, focusing on a neutral radical species within a cylindrical plasma, typical of a fluorescent lamp. By modeling the interplay between particle generation, diffusion towards the walls, and surface recombination, you will derive the effective loss frequency—a critical parameter for predicting the chemical composition and behavior of the plasma [@problem_id:308413].", "problem": "In low-pressure gas discharges, such as those found in fluorescent lamps or plasma display panels, excited neutral atoms and molecular radicals play a crucial role in the plasma chemistry. Consider a long cylindrical plasma positive column of radius $R$. A particular radical species is generated uniformly throughout the plasma volume at a constant rate $P_0$ (number of particles per unit volume per unit time).\n\nThe radicals are lost by diffusing to the wall and recombining on the surface. The transport of these neutral radicals towards the wall is governed by Fick's law of diffusion, with a constant diffusion coefficient $D$. At the wall ($r=R$), the radicals are lost due to surface recombination. This process is characterized by a recombination probability $\\beta$, which is the fraction of incident particles that are lost upon collision with the wall. The random flux of particles incident on any surface is given by $\\frac{1}{4} n v_{th}$, where $n$ is the particle number density at the surface and $v_{th}$ is their mean thermal velocity. Therefore, the recombination flux at the wall is $\\Gamma_{recomb} = \\beta \\frac{1}{4}n(R)v_{th}$. In steady state, this loss flux must be balanced by the diffusive flux arriving at the wall.\n\nThe effective particle loss frequency, $\\nu_{loss}$, is a key parameter that characterizes the overall loss rate. It is defined as the total number of particles lost to the wall per unit time, per unit length of the cylinder, divided by the total number of particles contained within that same unit length.\n\nDerive a closed-form expression for the effective particle loss frequency $\\nu_{loss}$ in terms of the cylinder radius $R$, the diffusion coefficient $D$, the recombination probability $\\beta$, and the mean thermal velocity $v_{th}$.", "solution": "1.

This de-excitation process is governed by a competition between radiative decay and non-radiative collisional quenching.\n\nConsider a model for such a discharge with the following processes:\n1.  **Production:** Ground-state mercury atoms are excited to the $6^3P_1$ state at a constant rate per unit volume, $P$.\n2.  **Radiative Decay:** An excited atom returns to the ground state by emitting a photon. This process is characterized by a natural radiative lifetime $\\tau_{rad}$.\n3.  **Self-Quenching:** An excited atom collides with a ground-state mercury atom and de-excites non-radiatively. This process is described by a rate coefficient $k_{Hg}$ and the number density of ground-state mercury atoms, $N_{Hg}$.\n4.  **Impurity Quenching:** An excited atom collides with a water vapor molecule ($H_2O$) and de-excites non-radiatively.
