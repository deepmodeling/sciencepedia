The CCP is driven by a high-frequency voltage source, resulting in a large voltage drop across the sheath with a peak amplitude of $V_0$.\n2.  The sheath dynamics can be described by a \"matrix sheath\" model, where the ion density, $n_0$, is assumed to be uniform throughout the sheath and equal to the bulk plasma density.
