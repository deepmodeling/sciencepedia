This exercise introduces a more realistic feature by incorporating a drag force at the fluid interface, a model that can represent physical effects like viscosity or ion-neutral friction in a plasma. By solving this problem, you will discover how a dissipative force can fundamentally alter the dynamics of the instability, revealing a critical drag value that separates a regime of growing oscillations from one of purely exponential growth [@problem_id:353072].", "problem": "Consider the interface at $z=0$ between two ideal, incompressible, and immiscible fluids.

A uniform gravitational field $\\mathbf{g}=-g\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ acts on the system. The configuration is unstable if $\\rho_1 > \\rho_2$.\n\nWe introduce a modification to this classic Rayleigh-Taylor instability problem. A drag force, localized at the interface, opposes the vertical motion of the fluid. This drag force per unit area is given by $\\mathbf{F}_D = -\\alpha v_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $v_z$ is the local vertical velocity of the interface and $\\alpha$ is a positive drag coefficient. This force acts as a source of pressure jump at the interface.

An unstable mode is characterized by $\\text{Im}(\\omega) > 0$. The nature of the instability depends on the value of $\\alpha$. For small $\\alpha$, the instability is oscillatory (i.e., $\\text{Re}(\\omega) \\neq 0$), exhibiting growing oscillations. For large $\\alpha$, the drag is strong enough to suppress oscillations, leading to a purely exponential, non-oscillatory growth (i.e., $\\text{Re}(\\omega)=0$).\n\nDerive the critical value of the drag coefficient, $\\alpha_{crit}$, for a given wavenumber $k$, that separates the oscillatory and non-oscillatory instability regimes.
