By analyzing a dispersion relation that couples the plasma dynamics to the wall's magnetic diffusion time [@problem_id:233743], you can explore a more nuanced classification of system behavior. This practice illuminates how key parameters determine whether stable modes are simple decays or damped oscillations, a fundamental concept in stability theory that is critical for designing feedback control systems for advanced fusion devices.", "problem": "The stability of an external kink mode in a magnetically confined plasma is significantly affected by the presence of a nearby conducting wall.
