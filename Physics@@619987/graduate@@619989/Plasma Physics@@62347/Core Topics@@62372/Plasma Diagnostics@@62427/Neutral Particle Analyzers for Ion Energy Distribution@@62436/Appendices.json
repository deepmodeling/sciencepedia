By viewing the plasma along multiple lines of sight (chords), one can perform a tomographic inversion to reconstruct the local ion emissivity profile.\n\nConsider a 2D cross-section of a plasma column centered at the origin $(0,0)$. The plasma is assumed to have a local emissivity $\\epsilon(r)$ that is constant on concentric circular surfaces, i.e., it only depends on the minor radius $r$. For numerical inversion, the plasma cross-section, which has a maximum radius of $R_{max}$, is discretized into $N$ concentric annuli. The $j$-th annulus is the region between a circle of radius $r_j$ and a circle of radius $r_{j+1}$, where $j$ ranges from $1$ to $N$. Within each annulus, the emissivity is assumed to be a constant value $\\epsilon_j$.\n\nAn NPA detector is placed at coordinates $(D, 0)$, where $D > R_{max}$. This detector measures the line-integrated emissivity along a fan of chords. The $i$-th chord is a straight line of sight originating from the detector at an angle $\\theta_i$ with respect to the negative x-axis (i.e., the line points into the first/fourth quadrants).\n\nThe signal $S_i$ from the $i$-th chord is related to the local emissivities $\\epsilon_j$ by the linear system $S_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} G_{ij} \\epsilon_j$. Here, $G_{ij}$ is the geometric matrix element representing the path length of the $i$-th chord through the $j$-th annulus.\n\nDerive the analytical expression for the geometric matrix element $G_{ij}$. Your derivation should assume that the $i$-th chord passes through both the inner boundary (radius $r_j$) and the outer boundary (radius $r_{j+1}$) of the $j$-th annulus.
