The technique's ability to measure velocity relies on the Doppler effect. For a particle moving with velocity component $v$ along the propagation axis of a laser beam, its rest-frame atomic transition frequency, $f_0$, is Doppler-shifted in the laboratory frame. For non-relativistic speeds ($v \\ll c$), the required laser frequency $f_L$ to induce fluorescence is given by the first-order relation:\n$$f_L = f_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{v}{c}\\right)$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of light.\n\nAn LIF system determines velocity by scanning the frequency of a tunable laser and measuring the resulting fluorescence intensity. To provide an absolute velocity measurement, the system must first be calibrated to establish a zero-velocity reference frequency. This is typically done by directing the laser into a stationary reference cell containing a specific isotope of the element of interest, which we will call isotope 1. The laser frequency that produces maximum fluorescence in this cell, which corresponds to the rest-frame transition frequency $f_{0,1}$ of isotope 1, is recorded by the system's software as the zero-velocity reference frequency, $f_{ref}$.

This phenomenon is known as the isotope shift.\n\nAssume the plasma containing only isotope 2 is perfectly stationary (i.e., its bulk fluid velocity is zero). Because the system is calibrated for isotope 1 but is measuring isotope 2, it will erroneously report a non-zero velocity.
