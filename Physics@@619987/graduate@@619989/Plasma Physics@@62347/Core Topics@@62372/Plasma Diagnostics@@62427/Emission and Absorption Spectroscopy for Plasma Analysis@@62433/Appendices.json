The rovibrational energy levels $E(v, J)$ of a diatomic molecule in a specific electronic state can be modeled by the expression:\n$$\nE(v, J) = G(v) + F_v(J)\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the vibrational quantum number and $J$ is the rotational quantum number. $G(v)$ represents the purely vibrational energy. The rotational energy term, $F_v(J)$, for a non-rigid rotator is given by:\n$$\nF_v(J) = B_v J(J+1) - D_v J^2(J+1)^2\n$$\nHere, $B_v$ is the rotational constant and $D_v$ is the first-order centrifugal distortion constant for the vibrational state $v$.\n\nAn absorption experiment is performed on a plasma containing a particular diatomic species. The frequencies, $\\nu$, of the transitions corresponding to the R-branch ($J' = J+1$) of a specific vibrational band ($v'' \\to v'$) are measured. Upon analysis, it is found that these transition frequencies can be accurately described by a quadratic polynomial in the index $m = J+1$, where $J$ is the rotational quantum number of the initial (lower) state:\n$$\n\\nu(m) = K_0 + K_1 m + K_2 m^2\n$$\nThe empirical coefficients $K_0, K_1, K_2$ are determined from a fit to the experimental data. The fact that a quadratic polynomial provides an excellent fit implies that higher-order terms are negligible. This requires a specific relationship between the centrifugal distortion constants of the upper ($v'$) and lower ($v''$) states.
