By applying Newton's second law and the principle of magnetic flux conservation, you will determine the precise external current profile, $I(t)$, needed to drive the implosion at a constant velocity, linking the external engineering controls to the fundamental plasma dynamics [@problem_id:359095].", "problem": "A theta-pinch system is designed to compress a cylindrical plasma. Consider a simplified model of this system, where a long, initially uniform plasma column of radius $r_0$ and constant mass density $\\rho_0$ is present at time $t=0$. This plasma contains an initially uniform, \"frozen-in\" axial magnetic field of magnitude $B_{z0}$.\n\nAt $t=0$, a large current $I(t)$ begins to flow in a single-turn conducting coil of length $L_c$ and radius $r_c$ (where $r_c > r_0$), which is coaxial with the plasma. This current generates a time-varying external axial magnetic field $B_{ext}(t)$ in the vacuum region between the coil and the plasma. For this idealized coil, the external field is related to the current by $B_{ext}(t) = \\mu_0 I(t) / L_c$.\n\nThe external field drives a thin, perfectly conducting plasma sheath radially inward. The objective is to drive the implosion such that the sheath maintains a constant inward velocity $v_p$. The radius of the sheath at time $t$ is therefore given by $r_p(t) = r_0 - v_p t$.\n\nAssume the following:\n1.  The implosion dynamics are described by the snowplow model, where the inward-moving sheath sweeps up all the stationary plasma it encounters.\n2.  The magnetic flux from the initial field $B_{z0}$ is conserved (trapped) within the imploding plasma sheath.\n3.  The plasma acts as a perfect conductor, completely excluding the external field $B_{ext}(t)$ and trapping the internal field.\n4.  The pressure of the neutral gas ahead of the sheath is negligible.\n\nDerive the expression for the coil current, $I(t)$, required to sustain this constant-velocity implosion.

Equation of Motion (Snowplow Model)**\nThe snowplow model is an expression of Newton's second law. The rate of change of momentum of the swept-up plasma must equal the net force acting on it. We consider a section of the cylinder of unit length.\n\nThe net force per unit length on the sheath is due to the difference between the external and internal magnetic pressures:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{net}}{L_c} = \\left( P_{B,ext} - P_{B,int} \\right) \\times (2\\pi r_p)\n$$\nwhere $P_{B,ext} = \\frac{B_{ext}^2}{2\\mu_0}$ and $P_{B,int} = \\frac{B_{int}^2}{2\\mu_0}$ are the external and internal magnetic pressures, respectively. $r_p(t)$ is the sheath radius at time $t$.\n$$\n\\frac{F_{net}}{L_c} = \\left( \\frac{B_{ext}(t)^2}{2\\mu_0} - \\frac{B_{int}(t)^2}{2\\mu_0} \\right) 2\\pi r_p(t) = \\frac{\\pi r_p(t)}{\\mu_0} \\left( B_{ext}(t)^2 - B_{int}(t)^2 \\right)\n$$\nThe rate of change of momentum per unit length for the collected mass is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{L_c} \\frac{d\\mathcal{P}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( m(t) v_p \\right)\n$$\nwhere $m(t)$ is the mass per unit length swept up by the sheath and $v_p$ is the constant implosion speed ($v_p = -dr_p/dt$).
