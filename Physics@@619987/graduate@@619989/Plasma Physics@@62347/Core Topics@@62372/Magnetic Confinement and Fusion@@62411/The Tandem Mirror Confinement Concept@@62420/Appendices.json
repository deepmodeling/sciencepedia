These mirrors reflect charged particles back into the central confinement region, reducing end losses.\n\nConsider one of these choke coils, modeled as a short solenoid of length $L$ and radius $a$, with a total of $N$ turns of wire. The coil is placed coaxially with the central solenoid, and the current $I$ in its windings flows in the same direction as the current producing the main field $B_0$. The superposition of the fields creates a region of high magnetic field strength, acting as a mirror.\n\nThe effectiveness of this mirror is characterized by the mirror ratio, $R_m$, defined as the ratio of the maximum magnetic field strength on the axis, $B_{max}$, to the minimum field strength, which is the field in the central region, $B_0$. The maximum field occurs at the geometric center of the choke coil.\n\nGiven the uniform background field $B_0$, the choke coil parameters ($L, a, N$), and a desired mirror ratio $R_m$, derive an expression for the required current $I$ that must flow through the choke coil.
