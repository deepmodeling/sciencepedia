The only non-vanishing two-point function for these fundamental fields is given by:\n$$\n\\langle \\psi(z) \\bar{\\psi}(w) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{z-w}\n$$\nFrom these fields, one can construct a U(1) current, which is a composite operator defined by the normal-ordered product:\n$$\nJ(z) = :\\psi(z)\\bar{\\psi}(z):\n$$\nThe normal ordering for two fermionic operators is defined by subtracting their vacuum expectation value singularity: $:\\psi(z)\\bar{\\psi}(z): = \\lim_{w\\to z} \\left( \\psi(w)\\bar{\\psi}(z) - \\langle \\psi(w)\\bar{\\psi}(z) \\rangle \\right)$.\n\nThe Operator Product Expansion (OPE) of $J(z)$ with the fundamental field $\\psi(w)$ as $z \\to w$ is a Laurent series in the variable $(z-w)$, whose coefficients are local operators defined at the point $w$.

We want to find the singular terms in its OPE with $\\psi(w)$.\n$$\nJ(z)\\psi(w) = :\\psi(z)\\bar{\\psi}(z): \\psi(w)\n$$\nWe use Wick's theorem for OPEs. This states that the product of a normal-ordered operator with another operator is given by the sum of all possible contractions between the fields of the two operators, plus the normal-ordered product of all fields. The fields within the existing normal-ordered product $:\\psi(z)\\bar{\\psi}(z):$ are not contracted with each other.\n\nWe consider contractions between the fields constituting $J(z)$ and the field $\\psi(w)$:\n1.

These arise from the first term, $\\frac{\\psi(z)}{z-w}$. The second term, $:\\psi(z)\\bar{\\psi}(z)\\psi(w):$, is regular at $z=w$ by definition of the normal product.\n\nTo find all singular terms, we perform a Taylor expansion of the numerator $\\psi(z)$ around the point $z=w$:\n$$\n\\psi(z) = \\psi(w) + (z-w)\\partial_w\\psi(w) + \\frac{(z-w)^2}{2!}\\partial_w^2\\psi(w) + \\dots\n$$\nSubstituting this into the term $\\frac{\\psi(z)}{z-w}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\psi(z)}{z-w} = \\frac{\\psi(w) + (z-w)\\partial_w\\psi(w) + O((z-w)^2)}{z-w} = \\frac{\\psi(w)}{z-w} + \\partial_w\\psi(w) + O(z-w)\n$$\nThe singular part of the OPE, denoted $(J(z)\\psi(w))_{\\text{sing}}$, is the part with negative powers of $(z-w)$.
