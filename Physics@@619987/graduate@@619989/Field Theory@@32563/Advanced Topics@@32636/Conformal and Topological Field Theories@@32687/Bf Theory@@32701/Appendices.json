The degrees of freedom are SU(2) group elements $U_l$ associated with each link $l$ of the lattice. The quantum states of the system are wavefunctions $\\Psi(\\{U_l\\})$. The theory is a form of lattice BF theory, governed by a Hamiltonian that energetically favors flat connections. This Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH = -J \\sum_p A_p\n$$\nwhere the sum is over all elementary plaquettes $p$ of the lattice, and $J$ is a positive coupling constant with units of energy. The operator $A_p$ acts on a state $\\Psi$ by projecting the holonomy around the plaquette $p$ to the trivial representation (spin-0).
