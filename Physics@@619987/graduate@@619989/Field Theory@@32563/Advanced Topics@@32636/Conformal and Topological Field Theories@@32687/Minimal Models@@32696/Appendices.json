This implies that the overall normalization of the block must be chosen to satisfy this condition. The conventional definition of conformal blocks indeed sets the coefficient of the leading singularity to one. The provided expression for $\\mathcal{F}_\\epsilon(x)$ might have a normalization constant related to OPE coefficients, which should be divided out to get the standard block normalization with $c_0=1$.\nLet's assume the block should be normalized such that $c_0=1$.\nOur calculated $g(x)$ before normalization is $g_{unnormalized}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1 + \\frac{1}{4}x + O(x^2))$.\nThe constant term is $g_{unnormalized}(0) = 1/\\sqrt{2}$. To enforce $c_0=1$, we must rescale the block: $\\mathcal{F}_{\\epsilon, \\text{norm}} = \\sqrt{2} \\mathcal{F}_{\\epsilon}$.\nThis leads to a normalized series part:\n$$\ng_{\\text{norm}}(x) = \\sqrt{2} g(x) = (1 + \\frac{1}{8}x + O(x^2)) \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{8}x + O(x^2)\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{4}x + O(x^2)\n$$\nSo, $g_{\\text{norm}}(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \\dots$ where $c_0 = 1$ and $c_1 = 1/4$.\nThis interpretation reconciles the given formula with the convention $c_0=1$.\n\nLet's retrace the calculation carefully without ambiguity.\nLet $\\mathcal{F}(x)$ be the given formula.\n$\\mathcal{F}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (x(1-x))^{-1/8} ( \\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{x}} - \\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{x}} )$.\nWe want to find $c_1$ in $\\mathcal{F}(x) = K x^{3/8} (c_0 + c_1 x + \\dots)$ with $c_0 = 1$.\nFirst, find the asymptotic behavior of $\\mathcal{F}(x)$ as $x\\to 0$.\n$\\mathcal{F}(x) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} x^{-1/8} \\cdot 1 \\cdot (\\sqrt{x}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} x^{3/8}$.\nThis means the constant $K$ is $1/\\sqrt{2}$ and $c_0=1$ for the given formula would be inconsistent. Let's trust the convention $c_0=1$ over the prefactor. This means the block to be expanded is\n$$ \\mathcal{F}^{\\text{normed}}_\\epsilon(x) = \\sqrt{2}\\mathcal{F}_\\epsilon(x) = (x(1-x))^{-1/8} \\left( \\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{x}} - \\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{x}} \\right) $$\nNow we expand this:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}^{\\text{normed}}_\\epsilon(x) = x^{3/8} \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n x^n $$\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n x^n = x^{-3/8} \\mathcal{F}^{\\text{normed}}_\\epsilon(x) = x^{-1/2} (1-x)^{-1/8} (\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{x}} - \\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{x}}) $$\nAs calculated before,\n$$ x^{-1/2} (\\sqrt{1+\\sqrt{x}} - \\sqrt{1-\\sqrt{x}}) = 1 + \\frac{1}{8}x + O(x^2) $$\n$$ (1-x)^{-1/8} = 1 + \\frac{1}{8}x + O(x^2) $$\nMultiplying them:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n x^n = (1 + \\frac{1}{8}x + O(x^2)) (1 + \\frac{1}{8}x + O(x^2)) = 1 + (\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{8})x + O(x^2) $$\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n x^n = 1 + \\frac{1}{4}x + O(x^2) $$\nBy comparing coefficients, we find $c_0=1$ and $c_1=1/4$.
