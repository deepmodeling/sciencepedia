Its dynamics are governed by primary fields, which correspond to the integrable highest-weight representations of the affine Kac-Moody algebra $\\hat{\\mathfrak{su}}(2)_k$.\n\nA deep connection exists between 2D WZW models and 3D Chern-Simons (CS) theory. The number of primary fields in the $SU(2)_k$ WZW model is exactly the dimension of the Hilbert space obtained from the canonical quantization of SU(2) Chern-Simons theory on a torus, $T^2$. This dimension, in turn, is equal to the number of integrable highest-weight representations of $\\hat{\\mathfrak{su}}(2)_k$.\n\nYour task is to calculate this number of primary fields.
