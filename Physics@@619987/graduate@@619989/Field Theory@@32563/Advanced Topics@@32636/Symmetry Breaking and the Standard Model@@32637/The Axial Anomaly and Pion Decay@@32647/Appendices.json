This symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the vector subgroup $SU(2)_V$ (isospin), giving rise to three massless Goldstone bosons, the pions ($\\pi^+, \\pi^0, \\pi^-$). The small, non-zero quark masses give the pions a small mass and lead to the Partially Conserved Axial Current (PCAC) hypothesis.\n\nThe PCAC relation connects the divergence of the isovector axial current, $J^{\\mu,a}_5(x) = \\bar{q}(x) \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma_5 \\frac{\\tau^a}{2} q(x)$ (where $q=(u,d)^T$ and $\\tau^a$ are the Pauli matrices), to the pion field $\\pi^a(x)$. For the neutral pion ($a=3$), this relation is\n$$ \\partial_\\mu J^{\\mu,3}_5(x) = f_\\pi m_\\pi^2 \\pi^0(x) $$\nwhere $f_\\pi \\approx 92.4 \\text{ MeV}$ is the pion decay constant and $m_\\pi$ is the neutral pion mass.\n\nThe chiral anomaly provides an independent, exact expression for the divergence of the axial current in the presence of an electromagnetic field.

The quark electric charges are $Q_u = 2/3$ and $Q_d = -1/3$ in units of $e$.
