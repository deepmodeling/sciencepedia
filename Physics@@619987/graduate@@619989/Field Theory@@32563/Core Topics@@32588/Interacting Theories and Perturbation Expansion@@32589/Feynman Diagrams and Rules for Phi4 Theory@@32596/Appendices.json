This first exercise provides practice in the fundamental skill of enumerating diagrams for a given physical process.

The external lines are considered labeled (e.g., by their respective momenta).", "solution": "Let $E$ be the number of external lines, $I$ the number of internal lines (propagators), and $V$ the number of vertices in a Feynman diagram.\n\nThe scattering process is $2 \\to 4$, so the total number of external lines is $E = 2 + 4 = 6$. The problem states that we are interested in connected, tree-level diagrams.\n\nFor any connected graph without loops (a tree), the number of vertices and internal lines are related by the topological formula:\n$$\nV = I + 1\n$$\nThe Lagrangian specifies a $\\phi^4$ interaction, which means that every vertex in a Feynman diagram must have exactly four lines connected to it. By counting the endpoints of all lines in the diagram, we can establish another relation between $E$, $I$, and $V$. The total number of line endpoints is $4V$, since each of the $V$ vertices has 4 lines attached. These endpoints must correspond to either an external line (which has one end at a vertex) or an internal line (which has both ends at vertices).\n$$\n4V = E + 2I\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $V$ and $I$, with $E=6$:\n1.  $V = I + 1$\n2.  $4V = 6 + 2I$\n\nWe can solve this system. Substitute eq. (1) into eq. (2):\n$$\n4(I+1) = 6 + 2I\n$$\n$$\n4I + 4 = 6 + 2I\n$$\n$$\n2I = 2\n$$\n$$\nI = 1\n$$\nUsing $I=1$ in eq. (1), we find the number of vertices:\n$$\nV = 1 + 1 = 2\n$$\nThus, every connected, tree-level Feynman diagram for this process must have exactly two vertices and one internal line. The single internal line connects the two vertices.\n\nEach vertex has 4 line \"slots\". One slot on each vertex is used by the internal line connecting them. This leaves $4-1=3$ slots on each vertex available for external lines. The total number of external lines is 6, which perfectly matches the $3+3=6$ available slots.\n\nThe problem of finding the number of distinct diagrams is now reduced to a combinatorial problem: in how many distinct ways can we attach the 6 labeled external lines to this two-vertex structure? This is equivalent to counting the number of ways to partition the set of 6 distinct external lines into two groups of 3.\n\nLet the set of external lines be $L$. The number of ways to choose 3 lines from the 6 available for the first vertex is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{3}$:\n$$\n\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20\n$$\nOnce 3 lines are chosen for the first vertex, the remaining 3 are automatically assigned to the second vertex.\n\nHowever, the two vertices are indistinguishable. A diagram where lines $\\{l_1, l_2, l_3\\}$ are attached to vertex A and $\\{l_4, l_5, l_6\\}$ are attached to vertex B is topologically identical to the diagram where $\\{l_4, l_5, l_6\\}$ are on vertex A and $\\{l_1, l_2, l_3\\}$ are on vertex B. This means we have counted each distinct diagram twice. Therefore, we must divide our result by 2.\n\nThe total number of distinct diagrams, $N$, is:\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{2} \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 20 = 10\n$$\n\nAlternatively, we can label the initial particles by momenta $\\{p_1, p_2\\}$ and final particles by $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4\\}$. Consider the vertex to which $p_1$ attaches. It must have two other external lines attached. We have two disjoint cases:\n1.  The other initial particle, $p_2$, attaches to the same vertex. To complete the group of three, one final particle must be chosen. There are $\\binom{4}{1}=4$ ways to choose which of the four final particles attaches to this vertex. The remaining 3 final particles attach to the other vertex. This gives 4 distinct diagrams.\n2.  The other initial particle, $p_2$, attaches to the other vertex. Then, the vertex with $p_1$ must be completed by two final particles. There are $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose two particles from the four final ones. The remaining two final particles attach to the other vertex along with $p_2$. This gives 6 distinct diagrams.\n\nSumming the possibilities from these two mutually exclusive cases, the total number of distinct diagrams is $N = 4 + 6 = 10$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "id": "313828"}, {"introduction": "When calculations are extended beyond tree-level to include quantum corrections, we encounter diagrams with closed loops.
