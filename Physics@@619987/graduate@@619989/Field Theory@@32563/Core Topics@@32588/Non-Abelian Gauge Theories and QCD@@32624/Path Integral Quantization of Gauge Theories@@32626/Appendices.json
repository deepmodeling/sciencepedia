Physical states are identified as elements of the cohomology of the BRST charge operator $Q$. A key property of this formalism is that BRST-exact states, which are of the form $Q|\\chi\\rangle$ for some state $|\\chi\\rangle$, are null states, i.e., they have zero norm.\n\nThis problem involves an explicit verification of this property for a specific state. Consider the QED Lagrangian in a general covariant gauge, with the gauge-fixing and Fadeev-Popov ghost terms:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = -\\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2\\xi} (\\partial_\\mu A^\\mu)^2 - \\partial_\\mu \\bar{c} \\, \\partial^\\mu c $$\nwhere $A^\\mu$ is the photon field, $c$ and $\\bar{c}$ are the ghost and anti-ghost fields respectively, and $\\xi$ is the gauge-fixing parameter. We work in Minkowski spacetime with metric $g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\text{diag}(1, -1, -1, -1)$.\n\nThe canonical quantization of this theory on a Fock space $\\mathcal{F}$ leads to creation and annihilation operators for photons ($a_\\mu^\\dagger, a_\\mu$), ghosts ($c^\\dagger, c$), and anti-ghosts ($\\bar{c}^\\dagger, \\bar{c}$). These operators obey the following non-zero (anti-)commutation relations (for on-shell momenta $k,p$ where $k^2=p^2=0$):\n$$ [a_\\mu(k), a_\\nu^\\dagger(p)] = -g_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta_{kp}, \\quad \\{c(k), \\bar{c}^\\dagger(p)\\} = \\delta_{kp}, \\quad \\{\\bar{c}(k), c^\\dagger(p)\\} = \\delta_{kp} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{kp} \\equiv (2\\pi)^3 2k_0 \\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{k}-\\vec{p})$. The vacuum state $|0\\rangle$ is annihilated by all annihilation operators. The inner product on $\\mathcal{F}$ is the one naturally induced by these relations.\n\nThe BRST charge operator $Q$ is defined by its (anti-)commutation relations with the fundamental field operators. Its action on the creation operators is given by:\n$$ [Q, a_\\mu^\\dagger(k)] = k_\\mu c^\\dagger(k) $$\n$$ \\{Q, c^\\dagger(k)\\} = 0 $$\n$$ \\{Q, \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\xi} k_\\mu a^{\\mu\\dagger}(k) $$\nThe BRST charge annihilates the vacuum: $Q|0\\rangle=0$.\n\nConsider a normalized single anti-ghost state $|\\bar{c}_f\\rangle$ defined by a wavepacket $f(k)$:\n$$ |\\bar{c}_f\\rangle = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3 2k_0} f(k) \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle $$\nwhere the wavepacket $f(k)$ is normalized such that $\\langle \\bar{c}_f | c_f \\rangle = 1$ (with $|c_f\\rangle$ being the corresponding ghost state). This normalization detail, however, will not be essential for the final result.\n\nYour task is to compute the norm of the BRST-exact state $|\\Psi_f\\rangle = Q|\\bar{c}_f\\rangle$.

First, let's construct this state explicitly.\nThe initial state is given by\n$$ |\\bar{c}_f\\rangle = \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3 2k_0} f(k) \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle $$\nLet's denote the Lorentz-invariant momentum-space measure as $d\\mu(k) = \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3 2k_0}$.\nSo, $|\\bar{c}_f\\rangle = \\int d\\mu(k) f(k) \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle$.\n\nWe apply the BRST charge operator $Q$ to this state:\n$$ |\\Psi_f\\rangle = Q|\\bar{c}_f\\rangle = Q \\int d\\mu(k) f(k) \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle $$\nSince $Q$ is a linear operator, we can move it inside the integral:\n$$ |\\Psi_f\\rangle = \\int d\\mu(k) f(k) Q \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle $$\nTo evaluate $Q \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle$, we use the fact that $Q$ and $\\bar{c}^\\dagger(k)$ are Grassmann-odd operators, so they anticommute. Also, we use the property that the vacuum is BRST-invariant, $Q|0\\rangle=0$.\n$$ Q \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle = \\{Q, \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k)\\}|0\\rangle - \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k)Q|0\\rangle = \\{Q, \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k)\\}|0\\rangle $$\nUsing the given relation $\\{Q, \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\xi} k_\\mu a^{\\mu\\dagger}(k)$, we get:\n$$ Q \\bar{c}^\\dagger(k) |0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\xi} k_\\mu a^{\\mu\\dagger}(k) |0\\rangle $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $|\\Psi_f\\rangle$:\n$$ |\\Psi_f\\rangle = \\int d\\mu(k) f(k) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\xi} k_\\mu a^{\\mu\\dagger}(k) \\right) |0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\xi} \\int d\\mu(k) f(k) k_\\mu a^{\\mu\\dagger}(k) |0\\rangle $$\nThis is the explicit form of the state whose norm we need to compute.\n\nThe norm is given by the inner product $\\langle \\Psi_f | \\Psi_f \\rangle$.

Since $a^\\nu(p)|0\\rangle = 0$, we have:\n$$ \\langle 0 | a^\\nu(p) a^{\\mu\\dagger}(k) | 0 \\rangle = \\langle 0 | [a^\\nu(p), a^{\\mu\\dagger}(k)] | 0 \\rangle $$\nUsing the given relation $[a_\\nu(p), a_\\mu^\\dagger(k)] = -g_{\\nu\\mu}\\delta_{pk}$, and raising the indices $\\nu, \\mu$ with $g^{\\nu\\alpha}g^{\\mu\\beta}$, we get $[a^\\alpha(p), a^\\beta(k)^\\dagger] = -g^{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta_{pk}$. (Note: Often the commutator is defined for $a_\\mu, a_\\nu^\\dagger$, giving $-g_{\\mu\\nu}$. This is equivalent.)\nSo, $\\langle 0 | [a^\\nu(p), a^{\\mu\\dagger}(k)] | 0 \\rangle = -g^{\\nu\\mu} \\delta_{pk} \\langle 0 | 0 \\rangle = -g^{\\nu\\mu} \\delta_{pk}$.\nLet's substitute this into the expression for the norm, using $\\delta_{pk} = (2\\pi)^3 2k_0 \\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{p}-\\vec{k})$:\n$$ \\langle \\Psi_f | \\Psi_f \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\xi^2} \\int d\\mu(p) \\int d\\mu(k) f^*(p) f(k) p_\\nu k_\\mu (-g^{\\nu\\mu} \\delta_{pk}) $$\n$$ \\langle \\Psi_f | \\Psi_f \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{\\xi^2} \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3 2p_0} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3 2k_0} f^*(p) f(k) (p_\\nu k^\\nu) (2\\pi)^3 2k_0 \\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{p}-\\vec{k}) $$\nWe can perform the integration over $\\vec{p}$ using the delta function $\\delta^{(3)}(\\vec{p}-\\vec{k})$, which sets $\\vec{p}=\\vec{k}$. Since $p$ and $k$ are on-shell momenta, $p_0=|\\vec{p}|$ and $k_0=|\\vec{k}|$, so $p_0=k_0$ as well. Thus, the four-vector $p$ is replaced by $k$.\n$$ \\langle \\Psi_f | \\Psi_f \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{\\xi^2} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3 2k_0} f^*(k) f(k) (k_\\nu k^\\nu) $$\nThe term $k_\\nu k^\\nu$ is the Lorentz-invariant scalar product of the four-momentum $k$ with itself, which is denoted as $k^2$.\n$$ \\langle \\Psi_f | \\Psi_f \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{\\xi^2} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3 2k_0} |f(k)|^2 k^2 $$\nThe photon field $A^\\mu$ and ghost fields $c, \\bar{c}$ are massless in QED. The creation and annihilation operators $a^\\dagger, a, c^\\dagger, c, \\bar{c}^\\dagger, \\bar{c}$ create and annihilate massless particles. This means their four-momentum $k$ must be on the mass shell, satisfying the condition $k^2 = k_0^2 - \\vec{k}^2 = 0$.\nTherefore, the factor $k^2$ inside the integral is zero for all values of $k$. The entire integrand is zero.\n$$ \\langle \\Psi_f | \\Psi_f \\rangle = -\\frac{1}{\\xi^2} \\int \\frac{d^3k}{(2\\pi)^3 2k_0} |f(k)|^2 \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\nThus, the norm of the state $|\\Psi_f\\rangle=Q|\\bar{c}_f\\rangle$ is zero, regardless of the choice of wavepacket $f(k)$ or the value of the gauge parameter $\\xi$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0} $$", "id": "353889"}, {"introduction": "The choice of gauge is a tool for calculation, and physical results must be independent of it.
