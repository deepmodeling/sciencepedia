The axion is the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global chiral $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry. In Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ) models, this symmetry is introduced along with new heavy fermions that are charged under both $U(1)_{PQ}$ and the color group $SU(3)_c$, while the Standard Model particles are neutral under $U(1)_{PQ}$.\n\nAfter the $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken at a high-energy scale $f_a$, the axion field remains massless until the temperature of the universe drops to the QCD scale, where non-perturbative effects generate a potential for the axion. This potential is periodic, and the number of degenerate vacuum states within one $2\\pi$ period of the axion field's fundamental space is determined by the domain wall number, $N_{DW}$. A value of $N_{DW} > 1$ can lead to a cosmological domain wall problem.\n\nThe domain wall number is given by the magnitude of the integer coefficient $N$ in the $U(1)_{PQ}-SU(3)_c-SU(3)_c$ anomaly equation, $N_{DW} = |N|$.
