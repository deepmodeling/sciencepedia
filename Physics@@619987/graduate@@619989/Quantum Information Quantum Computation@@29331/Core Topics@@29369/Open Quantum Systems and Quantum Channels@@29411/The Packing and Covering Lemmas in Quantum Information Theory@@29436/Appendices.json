These operators must satisfy the completeness relation $\\sum_m M_m^\\dagger M_m = I$, where $I$ is the identity operator. When a measurement is performed on a system in a state described by the density operator $\\rho$, the probability of obtaining outcome $m$ is given by $p_m = \\mathrm{Tr}(M_m^\\dagger M_m \\rho)$.
