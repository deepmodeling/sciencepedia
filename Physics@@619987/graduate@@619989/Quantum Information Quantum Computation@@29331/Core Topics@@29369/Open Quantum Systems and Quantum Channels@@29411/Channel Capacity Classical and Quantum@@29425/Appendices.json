The measurement operators corresponding to the outcomes `+` and `-` are the projectors onto the Hadamard basis states:\n$$M_+ = |+\\rangle\\langle+| = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$M_- = |-\\rangle\\langle-| = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThese form a valid POVM since $M_+ + M_- = I$.\n\nThe channel's action on an arbitrary input density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}(M_+ \\rho) \\sigma_0 + \\mathrm{Tr}(M_- \\rho) \\sigma_1$$\nwhere $\\sigma_0 = |0\\rangle\\langle0|$ and $\\sigma_1 = |1\\rangle\\langle1|$. This is a measure-and-prepare channel, and as stated in the problem, it is entanglement-breaking. For such channels, the classical capacity is not regularized and is given by the Holevo information:\n$$C(\\mathcal{E}) = \\chi(\\mathcal{E}) = \\max_{\\{p_i, \\rho_i\\}} \\left[ S\\left(\\sum_i p_i \\mathcal{E}(\\rho_i)\\right) - \\sum_i p_i S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_i)) \\right]$$\n\nTo maximize the Holevo information, we need to choose an optimal ensemble of input states $\\{p_i, \\rho_i\\}$. Due to the concavity of the von Neumann entropy, the maximum is always achieved for an ensemble of pure states. Let's consider a general pure input state $|\\psi\\rangle$, represented by a density matrix $\\rho = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$.\n\nLet the input state be represented in the Bloch sphere by the vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$, so $\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})$. A general density matrix is $\\rho = \\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ b^*  1-a \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe probabilities of the measurement outcomes are:\n$$p_+(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}(M_+ \\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\rho\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}( \\rho_{00} + \\rho_{01} + \\rho_{10} + \\rho_{11} ) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 2\\mathrm{Re}(\\rho_{01}))$$\n$$p_-(\\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}(M_- \\rho) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\rho\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}( \\rho_{00} - \\rho_{01} - \\rho_{10} + \\rho_{11} ) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 2\\mathrm{Re}(\\rho_{01}))$$\nThe output state is then:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = p_+(\\rho) |0\\rangle\\langle0| + p_-(\\rho) |1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\begin{pmatrix} p_+(\\rho)  0 \\\\ 0  p_-(\\rho) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe output state is always diagonal in the computational basis. Its entropy is the binary entropy of its eigenvalues:\n$$S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho)) = H(p_+(\\rho)) = -p_+(\\rho)\\log_2 p_+(\\rho) - p_-(\\rho)\\log_2 p_-(\\rho)$$\n\nTo maximize the Holevo quantity $\\chi(\\mathcal{E})$, we ideally want to make the second term, $\\sum_i p_i S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_i))$, as small as possible. The entropy $S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_i))$ is zero if the output state is pure, which occurs if $p_+(\\rho_i)$ is either 0 or 1.\n- $p_+(\\rho) = 1 \\implies \\mathrm{Re}(\\rho_{01}) = 1/2$. This is achieved by the pure input state $\\rho = |+\\rangle\\langle+|$, which has $\\rho_{01} = 1/2$.\n- $p_+(\\rho) = 0 \\implies \\mathrm{Re}(\\rho_{01}) = -1/2$. This is achieved by the pure input state $\\rho = |-\\rangle\\langle-|$, which has $\\rho_{01} = -1/2$.\n\nLet's choose an ensemble comprised of these two states, $\\{\\rho_1, \\rho_2\\}$, where $\\rho_1 = |+\\rangle\\langle+|$ and $\\rho_2 = |-\\rangle\\langle-|$.\nFor $\\rho_1 = |+\\rangle\\langle+|$:\n$$p_+(\\rho_1) = \\langle+|M_+|+\\rangle = \\langle+||+\\rangle\\langle+||+\\rangle = 1$$\n$$p_-(\\rho_1) = \\langle+|M_-|+\\rangle = \\langle+||-\\rangle\\langle-||+\\rangle = 0$$\nSo, $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_1) = 1 \\cdot |0\\rangle\\langle0| + 0 \\cdot |1\\rangle\\langle1| = |0\\rangle\\langle0|$. This is a pure state, so $S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_1)) = 0$.\n\nFor $\\rho_2 = |-\\rangle\\langle-|$:\n$$p_+(\\rho_2) = \\langle-|M_+|-\\rangle = \\langle-||+\\rangle\\langle+||-\\rangle = 0$$\n$$p_-(\\rho_2) = \\langle-|M_-|-\\rangle = \\langle-||-\\rangle\\langle-||-\\rangle = 1$$\nSo, $\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_2) = 0 \\cdot |0\\rangle\\langle0| + 1 \\cdot |1\\rangle\\langle1| = |1\\rangle\\langle1|$. This is also a pure state, so $S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_2)) = 0$.\n\nWith this choice of input states, the term $\\sum_i p_i S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_i))$ becomes zero for any probability distribution $\\{p_i\\}$.\nThe Holevo information simplifies to:\n$$\\chi(\\mathcal{E}) = S\\left(p_1 \\mathcal{E}(\\rho_1) + p_2 \\mathcal{E}(\\rho_2)\\right) - (p_1 \\cdot 0 + p_2 \\cdot 0) = S\\left(p_1 |0\\rangle\\langle0| + p_2 |1\\rangle\\langle1|\\right)$$\nThe state $\\bar{\\rho}_{\\text{out}} = p_1 |0\\rangle\\langle0| + p_2 |1\\rangle\\langle1|$ is a diagonal density matrix with eigenvalues $\\{p_1, p_2\\}$. Its entropy is the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution $\\{p_1, p_2\\}$, which is $H(p_1) = -p_1\\log_2 p_1 - p_2\\log_2 p_2$.\n\nTo maximize this quantity, we need to maximize $H(p_1)$. The binary entropy is maximized when the probabilities are equal, i.e., $p_1 = p_2 = 1/2$. For this choice:\n$$\\max_{p_1} H(p_1) = H(1/2) = - (1/2)\\log_2(1/2) - (1/2)\\log_2(1/2) = 1 \\text{ bit}.$$\nThe average output state is a maximally mixed state:\n$$\\bar{\\rho}_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{1}{2}|0\\rangle\\langle0| + \\frac{1}{2}|1\\rangle\\langle1| = \\frac{1}{2}I$$\nThe entropy is $S(I/2) = \\log_2(2) = 1$.\n\nSo, the maximal Holevo information is:\n$$\\chi(\\mathcal{E}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_1)) + \\frac{1}{2} S(\\mathcal{E}(\\rho_2))\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 0\\right) = 1$$\nThus, the classical capacity of the channel is 1 bit.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "50846"}, {"introduction": "Noise in multi-qubit systems is often correlated, a feature we can sometimes turn to our advantage.
