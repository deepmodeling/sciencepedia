Let $p$ be the success probability of the transformation. If the protocol succeeds, we obtain a state with 2 ebits. If it fails (with probability $1-p$), we assume the resulting state has 0 ebits of the desired bipartite form.

For instance, a protocol where two of the parties (e.g., Alice and Bob) perform local measurements and communicate their results to the other parties (Charlie and David) can succeed in creating the two Bell pairs with a probability of exactly $1/2$.
