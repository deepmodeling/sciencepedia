Let the set of input state indices be $V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The confusability of single-shot inputs is described by the pentagon graph $G = C_5$.

The result is $\\alpha(C_5 \\boxtimes C_5) = 5$. We can demonstrate this by constructing an independent set of size 5. Consider the following set of five vertices in $G^{(2)}$:\n$$\nS = \\{(0,0), (1,2), (2,4), (3,1), (4,3)\\}\n$$\nwhere the vertex labels are taken modulo 5. A systematic check confirms that no two vertices in $S$ are adjacent. For any pair of distinct vectors from the set, either the first components are non-adjacent in $C_5$, or the second components are non-adjacent.

The Lovász number is multiplicative under the strong product, i.e., $\\vartheta(G \\boxtimes H) = \\vartheta(G)\\vartheta(H)$. For the pentagon graph, it is known that $\\vartheta(C_5) = \\sqrt{5}$.
