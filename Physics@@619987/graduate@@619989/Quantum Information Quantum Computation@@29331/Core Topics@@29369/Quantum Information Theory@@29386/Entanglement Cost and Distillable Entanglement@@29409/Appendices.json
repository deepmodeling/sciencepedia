A pure bipartite quantum state $|\\Psi\\rangle_{AB}$ is a state vector in the tensor product Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{AB} = \\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_B$. For such states, the concepts of distillable entanglement ($E_D$) and entanglement cost ($E_C$) coincide. They are both equal to the entropy of entanglement, which is defined as the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix of either subsystem.\n\n2.  The entropy of entanglement is given by $E(|\\Psi\\rangle_{AB}) = S(\\rho_A) = S(\\rho_B)$, where $\\rho_A = \\text{Tr}_B(|\\Psi\\rangle_{AB}\\langle\\Psi|_{AB})$ is the reduced density matrix of subsystem A.
