It is designed to find the smallest positive integer $r$, called the order, such that $x^r \\equiv 1 \\pmod{N}$ for given coprime integers $x$ and $N$.\n\nThe algorithm uses two quantum registers: a control register with $Q=2^n$ states (for some integer $n$) and a target register. After a series of operations involving controlled modular exponentiation, a measurement on the target register projects the control register into a periodic superposition of computational basis states. For simplicity, we will consider the case where this post-measurement state is given by:\n$$\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{M}} \\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} |mr\\rangle\n$$\nHere, $r$ is the order, and the sum is over all non-negative integers $m$ such that $mr < Q$.
