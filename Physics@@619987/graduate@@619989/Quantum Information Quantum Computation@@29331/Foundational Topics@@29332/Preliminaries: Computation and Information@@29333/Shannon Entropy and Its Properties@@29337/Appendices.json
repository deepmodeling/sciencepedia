The probability of $Y$ taking a specific value $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$ is the sum of probabilities of all $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ such that $\\text{Tr}(x)=y$. Since $X$ is uniform, $P(X=x) = 1/p^n$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. Thus, the probability mass function for $Y$ is:\n$$\nP(Y=y) = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}, \\text{Tr}(x)=y} P(X=x) = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}, \\text{Tr}(x)=y} \\frac{1}{p^n} = \\frac{|\\{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n} \\mid \\text{Tr}(x)=y\\}|}{p^n}\n$$\nwhere $|\\{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n} \\mid \\text{Tr}(x)=y\\}|$ is the number of elements in $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ whose trace is equal to $y$. Let's denote this quantity by $N_y$. To compute $H(Y)$, we first need to determine the distribution of $Y$, which means finding $N_y$ for each $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nWe can view the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ as an $n$-dimensional vector space over its prime subfield $\\mathbb{F}_p$. The trace map $\\text{Tr}: \\mathbb{F}_{p^n} \\to \\mathbb{F}_p$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_p$-linear map. This can be verified from its definition: For $a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$ and $x, z \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, we have $\\text{Tr}(ax+bz) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (ax+bz)^{p^i} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a^{p^i}x^{p^i} + b^{p^i}z^{p^i})$. Since $a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, they are fixed by the Frobenius automorphism, i.e., $a^{p^i} = a$ and $b^{p^i} = b$. Thus, $\\text{Tr}(ax+bz) = a\\sum x^{p^i} + b\\sum z^{p^i} = a\\text{Tr}(x) + b\\text{Tr}(z)$.\n\nThe trace map is a non-zero linear functional. A key property of the trace map is that it is surjective, meaning its image, $\\text{im}(\\text{Tr})$, is the entire field $\\mathbb{F}_p$. As a vector space over itself, $\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(\\mathbb{F}_p) = 1$.\n\nAccording to the rank-nullity theorem for linear maps, the dimension of the domain is the sum of the dimensions of the kernel and the image:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(\\ker(\\text{Tr})) + \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(\\text{im}(\\text{Tr}))\n$$\nWe have $\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}) = n$ and $\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(\\text{im}(\\text{Tr})) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(\\mathbb{F}_p) = 1$.\nTherefore, the dimension of the kernel of the trace map is:\n$$\n\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_p}(\\ker(\\text{Tr})) = n - 1\n$$\nThe kernel, $\\ker(\\text{Tr}) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n} \\mid \\text{Tr}(x)=0\\}$, is a subspace of dimension $n-1$. The number of elements in a vector space of dimension $d$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is $p^d$. Thus, the number of elements with trace 0 is:\n$$\nN_0 = |\\ker(\\text{Tr})| = p^{n-1}\n$$\nNow we need to find $N_y$ for $y \\neq 0$. Since the trace map is surjective, for any $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$, there exists at least one element $x_y \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ such that $\\text{Tr}(x_y) = y$. The set of all elements with trace $y$, $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{F}_{p^n} \\mid \\text{Tr}(x)=y\\}$, is a fiber of the linear map. For any $x$ in this fiber, we can write $x = x_y + (x - x_y)$. By linearity, $\\text{Tr}(x-x_y) = \\text{Tr}(x) - \\text{Tr}(x_y) = y - y = 0$. This means $x - x_y \\in \\ker(\\text{Tr})$.\nTherefore, the set of elements with trace $y$ is the coset $x_y + \\ker(\\text{Tr}) = \\{x_y + k \\mid k \\in \\ker(\\text{Tr})\\}$. All cosets of a subspace have the same cardinality as the subspace itself. So, for any $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$:\n$$\nN_y = |x_y + \\ker(\\text{Tr})| = |\\ker(\\text{Tr})| = p^{n-1}\n$$\nThis shows that every element $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$ is the trace of exactly $p^{n-1}$ elements from $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.\n\nNow we can calculate the probability $P(Y=y)$:\n$$\nP(Y=y) = \\frac{N_y}{p^n} = \\frac{p^{n-1}}{p^n} = \\frac{1}{p}\n$$\nThis is true for all $y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$. This means that the random variable $Y$ is uniformly distributed over the $p$ elements of $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nFinally, we compute the Shannon entropy of this uniform distribution in bits (logarithm base 2):\n$$\nH(Y) = -\\sum_{y \\in \\mathbb{F}_p} P(Y=y) \\log_2(P(Y=y)) = -\\sum_{y=0}^{p-1} \\frac{1}{p} \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)\n$$\nSince there are $p$ identical terms in the sum:\n$$\nH(Y) = -p \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{p} \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)\\right) = -\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{p}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log(a^{-1}) = -\\log(a)$:\n$$\nH(Y) = -(-\\log_2(p)) = \\log_2(p)\n$$\nThe Shannon entropy of $Y$ is $\\log_2(p)$ bits.
