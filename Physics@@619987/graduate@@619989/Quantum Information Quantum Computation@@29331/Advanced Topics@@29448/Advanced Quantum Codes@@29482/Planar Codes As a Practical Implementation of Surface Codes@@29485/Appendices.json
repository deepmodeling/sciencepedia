Consider a planar code of distance $d$ implemented on a rotated square lattice. In this convention, data qubits are located on the edges of the lattice, while Z-type and X-type stabilizers are associated with plaquettes (faces) and vertices, respectively.\n\nA minimal logical Z operator, denoted $Z_L$, can be represented as a product of Pauli-Z operators acting on a straight, contiguous path of $d$ horizontal data qubits connecting the left and right boundaries of the code. The weight of this minimal operator is $\\text{wt}(Z_L) = d$.\n\nWe can create a non-minimal, but equivalent, logical operator by multiplying $Z_L$ by stabilizer operators. Consider two bulk Z-stabilizers, $S_i$ and $S_j$. These correspond to two plaquettes, $p_i$ and $p_j$, that are horizontally adjacent, sharing a single vertical edge. Their positions are such that the path of the minimal logical operator $Z_L$ runs along their entire upper boundary, as depicted in the schematic below.\n\n```\n      ...-- h_i -- v -- h_j --...

The plaquettes $p_i$ and $p_j$ share the vertical edge $v$.\n\nCalculate the weight of the non-minimal logical operator $Z_L' = Z_L \\cdot S_i \\cdot S_j$.

This exercise [@problem_id:109980] provides a direct, hands-on application of the stabilizer formalism on a small, illustrative planar code. By computing the error syndrome resulting from a specific Pauli error and then determining the minimum-weight correction, you will trace the complete, fundamental cycle of error detection and correction.", "problem": "Consider a small quantum error-correcting code designed with a structure analogous to a planar code. The code utilizes nine data qubits arranged in a $3 \\times 3$ grid, labeled as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{matrix}\nq_1 & - & q_2 & - & q_3 \\\\\n|   &   & |   &   & |   \\\\\nq_4 & - & q_5 & - & q_6 \\\\\n|   &   & |   &   & |   \\\\\nq_7 & - & q_8 & - & q_9 \\\\\n\\end{matrix}\n$$\nThe code is defined by the following four stabilizer generators, which are products of Pauli operators:\n- $P_{Z1} = Z_1 Z_2 Z_4 Z_5$\n- $P_{X1} = X_2 X_3 X_5 X_6$\n- $P_{X2} = X_4 X_5 X_7 X_8$\n- $P_{Z2} = Z_5 Z_6 Z_8 Z_9$\n\nInitially, the system is prepared in a state $|\\psi\\rangle$ within the code space, such that for every stabilizer $S_k$ in the set $\\{P_{Z1}, P_{X1}, P_{X2}, P_{Z2}\\}$, $S_k |\\psi\\rangle = +1 |\\psi\\rangle$.\n\nSuppose the system suffers a single-qubit error on the central qubit, $q_5$, described by the Pauli operator $E = Y_5$.

The correction is considered successful if the operator product $C E$ returns the state to the code space (i.e., $CE$ is an element of the stabilizer group $\\mathcal{S}$, which consists of all possible products of the generators). The correction operator $C$ should be specified as a product of Pauli matrices on specific qubits (e.g., $X_i Z_j$). Ignore any overall phase factors.", "solution": "The solution involves two main steps: first, calculating the error syndrome, and second, finding the minimum-weight Pauli operator that produces this syndrome.\n\n**Step 1: Syndrome Calculation**\n\nThe syndrome is determined by checking whether the error operator $E$ commutes or anti-commutes with each stabilizer generator $S_k$. If $[E, S_k] = 0$, the measurement outcome for $S_k$ is $+1$. If $\\{E, S_k\\} = ES_k + S_kE = 0$, the outcome is $-1$. Two Pauli strings commute if they anti-commute on an even number of shared qubits, and they anti-commute if they anti-commute on an odd number of shared qubits.\n\nThe error is $E = Y_5 = iX_5Z_5$. We examine its relation with each of the four stabilizers.\n\n1.  **Commutation with $P_{Z1} = Z_1 Z_2 Z_4 Z_5$**:\n    The operators $P_{Z1}$ and $E$ have support on overlapping qubit sets, with the only common qubit being $q_5$. We only need to check the commutation relation for the operators on this qubit: $Z_5$ and $Y_5$.\n    The Pauli operators $Y$ and $Z$ on the same qubit anti-commute: $\\{Y, Z\\} = YZ + ZY = (iXZ)Z + Z(iXZ) = iX(Z^2) + iZXZ = iX - i(XZ)Z = iX - i(-X) = 2iX \\neq 0$. More directly, $\\{Y_5, Z_5\\}=0$.\n    Since they anti-commute on one qubit (an odd number), the full operators $E$ and $P_{Z1}$ anti-commute.\n    Syndrome for $P_{Z1}$ is $-1$.\n\n2.  **Commutation with $P_{X1} = X_2 X_3 X_5 X_6$**:\n    The only common qubit between $P_{X1}$ and $E=Y_5$ is $q_5$. The relevant operators are $X_5$ and $Y_5$.\n    The Pauli operators $X$ and $Y$ on the same qubit anti-commute: $\\{X, Y\\} = XY+YX = X(iXZ) + (iXZ)X = iX^2Z + iXZX = iZ -iX(XZ) = iZ-i(-Z) = 2iZ \\neq 0$. More directly, $\\{X_5, Y_5\\}=0$.\n    Since they anti-commute on one qubit, $E$ and $P_{X1}$ anti-commute.\n    Syndrome for $P_{X1}$ is $-1$.\n\n3.  **Commutation with $P_{X2} = X_4 X_5 X_7 X_8$**:\n    The only common qubit is $q_5$. The operators are $X_5$ and $Y_5$. As established above, they anti-commute.\n    Therefore, $E$ and $P_{X2}$ anti-commute.\n    Syndrome for $P_{X2}$ is $-1$.\n\n4.  **Commutation with $P_{Z2} = Z_5 Z_6 Z_8 Z_9$**:\n    The only common qubit is $q_5$. The operators are $Z_5$ and $Y_5$. As established above, they anti-commute.\n    Therefore, $E$ and $P_{Z2}$ anti-commute.\n    Syndrome for $P_{Z2}$ is $-1$.\n\nThe full error syndrome is $(-1, -1, -1, -1)$, meaning all four stabilizer measurements yield a $-1$ outcome.\n\n**Step 2: Minimum-Weight Correction**\n\nThe decoding procedure aims to find the simplest (minimum-weight) Pauli operator $C$ that produces the same syndrome as the error $E$. This means $C$ must also anti-commute with all four stabilizer generators.\n\nLet the correction operator be $C$.\n- $C$ must anti-commute with $P_{Z1}$ and $P_{Z2}$. This implies $C$ must have a component ($X$ or $Y$) that anti-commutes with the $Z$ operators in the stabilizers.\n- $C$ must anti-commute with $P_{X1}$ and $P_{X2}$. This implies $C$ must have a component ($Z$ or $Y$) that anti-commutes with the $X$ operators in the stabilizers.\n\nLet's test possible correction operators, starting with weight-1 operators.\nA weight-1 operator acts non-trivially on only a single qubit $q_k$. For such an operator to anti-commute with a stabilizer $S$, it must act on a qubit in the support of $S$ and the local Pauli operators must anti-commute.\n\nFrom the stabilizer definitions, we see that $q_5$ is the only qubit that is part of the support of all four stabilizer generators.\n- $P_{Z1} = Z_1 Z_2 Z_4 Z_5$\n- $P_{X1} = X_2 X_3 X_5 X_6$\n- $P_{X2} = X_4 X_5 X_7 X_8$\n- $P_{Z2} = Z_5 Z_6 Z_8 Z_9$\n\nAny correction operator that does not act on $q_5$ cannot anti-commute with all four stabilizers simultaneously. For example, an operator on $q_1$ could only anti-commute with $P_{Z1}$ (if it's $X_1$ or $Y_1$), but would commute with the other three.\n\nTherefore, the minimum-weight correction operator must be a Pauli operator acting on $q_5$. Let this operator be $C = P_5$, where $P \\in \\{X, Y, Z\\}$.\nWe test each possibility:\n- If $C = X_5$: It anti-commutes with $P_{Z1}$ and $P_{Z2}$ (since $\\{X_5, Z_5\\}=0$). It commutes with $P_{X1}$ and $P_{X2}$ (since $[X_5, X_5]=0$). This does not match the syndrome.\n- If $C = Z_5$: It commutes with $P_{Z1}$ and $P_{Z2}$ (since $[Z_5, Z_5]=0$). It anti-commutes with $P_{X1}$ and $P_{X2}$ (since $\\{Z_5, X_5\\}=0$). This does not match the syndrome.\n- If $C = Y_5$: It anti-commutes with $P_{Z1}$ and $P_{Z2}$ (since $\\{Y_5, Z_5\\}=0$). It also anti-commutes with $P_{X1}$ and $P_{X2}$ (since $\\{Y_5, X_5\\}=0$). This perfectly matches the calculated syndrome.\n\nThe minimum-weight operator that produces the syndrome $(-1,-1,-1,-1)$ is $C=Y_5$. This is a weight-1 operator. Any other operator producing the same syndrome would have to be $Y_5$ multiplied by an element of the stabilizer group, which would result in a higher weight.\n\nThe correction operator is $C = Y_5$. Applying this correction to the errored state gives the total operator $CE = Y_5 Y_5 = I$.

The logical state is protected by measuring stabilizer operators, which are products of Pauli operators acting on specific groups of data qubits. There are two types of stabilizers: $X$-type plaquette operators and $Z$-type vertex operators.\n\nConsider a $Z$-type stabilizer (a \"star\" or \"vertex\" operator) for a vertex $v$ involving four data qubits, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The stabilizer operator is given by $S_v = Z_1 \\otimes Z_2 \\otimes Z_3 \\otimes Z_4$, where $Z_i$ is the Pauli-Z operator on qubit $i$.\n\nThe measurement of $S_v$ is typically performed using an ancillary qubit, labeled 'a'.
