For this problem, we consider a simplified model of a $[[2,1]]$ QCC, whose encoding is described by a $2 \\times 1$ generator matrix $G(D)$ over the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{F}_2[D]$. This matrix maps a single logical information stream (represented as a formal Laurent series in $D$) to two physical qubit streams.\n\nThe non-catastrophic nature of the code implies the existence of a polynomial left inverse, $G_L^{-1}(D)$.
