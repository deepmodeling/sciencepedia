The error-detecting Z-type stabilizers, $S_Z$, are associated with the elementary plaquettes (faces) of this lattice. For a plaquette $p_{i,j}$ defined by the four corner qubits at $(i,j), (i+1,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j+1)$, the corresponding stabilizer operator is $S_Z(p_{i,j}) = Z_{i,j}Z_{i+1,j}Z_{i,j+1}Z_{i+1,j+1}$, where $Z_{i,j}$ is the Pauli-Z operator on the qubit at $(i,j)$.\n\nSyndrome measurement detects errors. A plaquette is flagged as a 'defect' if its stabilizer measurement outcome is $-1$. A single Pauli-X error or Pauli-Y error on a data qubit at $(i,j)$ anticommutes with (and thus flips the measurement outcome of) all four Z-stabilizers associated with plaquettes that share the qubit $(i,j)$ as a corner. If a plaquette is affected by two such errors, the effects cancel ($(-1) \\times (-1) = 1$), and it is not a final defect.

When a Z-type stabilizer measurement yields a $-1$ outcome, it indicates a \"Z-defect\" or \"Z-syndrome\" at the location of that stabilizer. The MWPM decoder constructs a graph where the nodes are these defects. The weight of an edge connecting two defects is determined by the probability of the physical error chain that connects them. For an error chain consisting of single-qubit X-errors, its probability is the product of the individual error probabilities of the qubits in the chain. The edge weight is defined as the negative logarithm of this probability. A lower weight corresponds to a more probable error chain.
