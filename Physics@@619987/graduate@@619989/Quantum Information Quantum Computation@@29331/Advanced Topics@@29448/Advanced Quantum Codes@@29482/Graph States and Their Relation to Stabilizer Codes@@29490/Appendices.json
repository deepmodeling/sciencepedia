For each vertex $i \\in V$, the generator $K_i$ is given by:\n$$ K_i = X_i \\prod_{j \\in N(i)} Z_j $$\nwhere $X_i$ and $Z_j$ are the Pauli operators acting on qubits $i$ and $j$ respectively, and $N(i)$ is the set of neighbors of vertex $i$ in the graph $G$. The set of all products of these generators forms the stabilizer group $\\mathcal{S}$, and the graph code is the 1-dimensional subspace stabilized by $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWhen an error, represented by a Pauli operator $E$, occurs on the state, we can detect it by measuring the eigenvalues of the stabilizer generators. This measurement yields a classical syndrome vector $s \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$. The $i$-th bit of the syndrome, $s_i$, is $0$ if $[K_i, E] = K_i E - E K_i = 0$ (they commute), and $s_i=1$ if $\\{K_i, E\\} = K_i E + E K_i = 0$ (they anti-commute).

The vertices of this graph can be labeled by binary strings of length 3, from $000$ to $111$. Two vertices are connected by an edge if their binary labels differ in exactly one position.

The only $X$ or $Y$ operator in $S_v$ is $X_v$. Thus, $S_v$ anticommutes with $Z_i$ if and only if $v=i$.\n\n2.  **Commutation of $S_v$ with $X_j$:**\n    $S_v$ anticommutes with $X_j$ if and only if it contains a $Z$ or $Y$ operator on qubit $j$. The operator $S_v$ contains $Z_u$ for all neighbors $u$ of $v$. Thus, $S_v$ anticommutes with $X_j$ if and only if $j \\in N(v)$.\n\nCombining these, $S_v$ anticommutes with $E = Z_i X_j$ if the total number of anticommuting pairs is odd. Let $\\sigma_v = 1$ denote a non-trivial syndrome at $v$ (anticommutation) and $\\sigma_v = 0$ denote a trivial one (commutation).

Since $i \\neq j$ and a vertex is not in its own neighborhood ($j \\notin N(j)$), this is $(0+0) \\pmod 2 = 0$. The syndrome is trivial at $v=j$.\n*   **Case 3: $v \\in N(j)$ and $v \\neq i$**\n    Here, $v \\neq i$. Also, since the graph is undirected, $v \\in N(j) \\implies j \\in N(v)$.\n    $\\sigma_v = (\\mathbb{I}[v=i] + \\mathbb{I}[j \\in N(v)]) \\pmod 2 = (0+1) \\pmod 2 = 1$.

The syndrome is trivial.\n\nSo, the set of vertices with a non-trivial syndrome, let's call it $K^*$, is $K^* = N(j) \\setminus \\{i\\}$.\nThe graph $Q_3$ is a 3-regular graph, meaning every vertex has degree 3. So $|N(j)| = 3$. Since $i \\in N(j)$, the size of $K^*$ is $|N(j)|-1 = 3-1=2$. Let $K^* = \\{k_1, k_2\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the minimum weight Pauli error $E'$ with syndrome at $K^*$.**\nWe are looking for the lowest weight Pauli error $E'$ that anticommutes with $S_{k_1}$ and $S_{k_2}$, and commutes with all other $S_v$.\nThe syndrome of a product of Pauli errors is the linear sum (over $\\mathbb{F}_2$) of the individual syndromes. Let the syndrome vector for an error $P_m$ on a single qubit $m$ be $s(P_m)$.\n\n*   If $E' = Z_m$, it anticommutes only with $S_m$. The syndrome is non-trivial at the single vertex $m$. This cannot match our required syndrome at two vertices, $\\{k_1, k_2\\}$.\n*   If $E' = X_m$, it anticommutes with $S_v$ for all $v \\in N(m)$. In $Q_3$, $|N(m)|=3$. We need a syndrome at 2 vertices, not 3.\n*   If $E' = Y_m = iZ_m X_m$, it anticommutes with $S_m$ and all $S_v$ for $v \\in N(m)$. The syndrome is non-trivial at $\\{m\\} \\cup N(m)$, which is a set of $1+3=4$ vertices. This does not match.\n\nTherefore, no single-qubit error can produce the required syndrome.

This is exactly the syndrome we require.\n    The weight of this error $E'$ is 2.\n\nSince we have found an error of weight 2 that produces the correct syndrome, and we have shown that no error of weight 1 can do so, the minimum weight of such an error is 2.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2} $$", "id": "89907"}]}
