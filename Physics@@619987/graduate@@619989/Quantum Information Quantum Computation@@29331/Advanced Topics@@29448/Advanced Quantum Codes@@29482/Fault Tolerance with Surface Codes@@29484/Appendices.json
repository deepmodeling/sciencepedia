This first practice task [@problem_id:82687] provides a clear, hands-on example of this principle, asking you to determine the error chain that a Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder would infer from a simple, persistent measurement fault.", "problem": "Consider a standard toric surface code defined on a large 2D square lattice. The data qubits reside on the edges of the lattice. The stabilizer group is generated by two types of operators: $X$-stabilizers (star operators) centered on vertices and $Z$-stabilizers (plaquette operators) centered on the faces of the lattice.\n\nTo detect errors, all stabilizers are measured periodically in discrete time steps $t=1, 2, 3, \\dots$. We focus on the detection of $X$-type errors using the $Z$-stabilizers. A syndrome is extracted at each time step, where a value of $-1$ for a given $Z$-stabilizer indicates that an odd number of $X$ errors has occurred on its support. A defect is registered at a spacetime location $(p, t)$ if the measurement outcome of the plaquette stabilizer $S_p$ at time $t$ differs from its outcome at time $t-1$.\n\nDecoding is performed using a minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm on a 3D spacetime graph of these defects. The vertices of this graph are the spacetime locations of the defects. Edges in the graph represent the most likely fundamental error events that could connect a pair of defects. We consider a simplified noise model where any single-qubit $X$ error or any single-plaquette measurement error are equally probable. Consequently, the weight of any edge in the decoding graph that corresponds to a single fundamental error event is taken to be unity.\n\nSuppose a single $Z$-plaquette detector, for a plaquette labeled $p_0$, is faulty. This detector becomes \"stuck\" and reports the incorrect value of $-1$ for $K$ consecutive measurement cycles, from $t=1$ to $t=K$. Before this period (at $t=0$) and after (from $t=K+1$ onwards), the detector functions correctly. Assume that the system is initialized in a state with all stabilizer outcomes being $+1$, and no actual qubit errors occur throughout this entire process.\n\nThe MWPM decoder will interpret the pattern of defects caused by this faulty detector and identify a corresponding error chain (a path in the decoding graph) to correct it. What is the total weight of this error chain?", "solution": "A faulty detector at plaquette $p_0$ that is \"stuck\" at $-1$ from $t=1$ to $t=K$ will generate the following measurement outcomes $m(p_0, t)$:\n- $m(p_0, 0) = +1$ (initial correct state)\n- $m(p_0, t) = -1$ for $t = 1, 2, \\dots, K$ (stuck faulty state)\n- $m(p_0, t) = +1$ for $t \\geq K+1$ (correct state again)\n\nA defect is registered at a spacetime location $(p, t)$ whenever the measurement outcome flips, i.e., $m(p, t) \\neq m(p, t-1)$. For the plaquette $p_0$, we observe flips at two specific times:\n1.  At $t=1$, the outcome flips from $m(p_0, 0)=+1$ to $m(p_0, 1)=-1$. This creates a defect at $(p_0, 1)$.\n2.  At $t=K+1$, the outcome flips from $m(p_0, K)=-1$ to $m(p_0, K+1)=+1$. This creates a defect at $(p_0, K+1)$.\n\nFor all other times $t \\in [2, K]$, the outcome remains $-1$, so no defect is registered. For all other plaquettes $p \\neq p_0$, the outcome is always $+1$, so no defects are registered. The decoder therefore only sees two defects: one at $(p_0, 1)$ and one at $(p_0, K+1)$.\n\nThe MWPM decoder must find the minimum-weight error chain that connects these two defects. In the spacetime graph:\n- A spatial edge (representing a qubit error) connects defects at the same time but different locations.\n- A temporal edge (representing a measurement error) connects defects at the same location but adjacent times. Each such edge has a weight of 1.\n\nThe most likely cause for two defects at the same spatial location separated by $K$ time steps is a chain of $K$ consecutive measurement errors at that location. This chain consists of $K$ temporal edges, from $(p_0, 1)$ to $(p_0, 2)$, from $(p_0, 2)$ to $(p_0, 3)$, ..., and finally from $(p_0, K)$ to $(p_0, K+1)$. The defects at the intermediate times $t=2, \\dots, K$ are created and then immediately annihilated by the next error in the chain, so they are not observed.\n\nThe total weight of this path is the sum of the weights of the $K$ individual measurement errors. Since each has a weight of 1, the total weight of the inferred error chain is $K$. Any path involving spatial (qubit) errors would be longer and thus have a higher weight.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{K} $$", "id": "82687"}, {"introduction": "While the MWPM algorithm is powerful, its guiding principle—that the shortest error path is the most likely—can sometimes lead it astray. Understanding when and how the decoder fails is crucial to appreciating the limits of an error-correcting code. In this exercise [@problem_id:82660], you will analyze a classic scenario where a high-weight physical error mimics a low-weight one, causing the decoder to choose a correction that results in a logical error and revealing the connection between the code's distance $d$ and its fundamental robustness.", "problem": "Consider a rotated planar surface code of distance $d$, where $d$ is an odd integer. The code's data qubits reside on the edges of a grid. The stabilizers are of two types: X-type star operators associated with vertices of one sublattice (say, white vertices on a checkerboard), and Z-type plaquette operators associated with the faces of the grid.\n\nA Pauli-Z error chain $E$ occurs on the data qubits. The resulting error syndrome is measured, and it is found that exactly two X-stabilizers, $S_A$ and $S_B$, are violated (i.e., their measurement outcome is -1). The vertices corresponding to $S_A$ and $S_B$ are adjacent in the grid, connected by a single edge which corresponds to data qubit $q_{AB}$.\n\nA standard minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder is used to infer the error from the syndrome. To correct an error syndrome consisting of two defects, the decoder's default assumption is that the error occurred along the shortest path between the defects. In this case, it infers an error chain $E_{inf}$ consisting of a single Pauli-Z error on the qubit $q_{AB}$.\n\nHowever, this inference is incorrect. The actual error chain, $E_{actual}$, is different from $E_{inf}$, but creates the same syndrome. The combination of the actual error and the decoder's inferred correction, $E_{actual} \\cdot E_{inf}$, constitutes a non-trivial logical Z operator, $Z_L$, leading to a logical error.\n\nAssuming such a logical error has occurred, determine the minimum possible weight of the error chain $E_{actual}$. The weight of an error chain is the number of single-qubit Pauli operators it contains. Express your answer in terms of the code distance $d$.", "solution": "Let $E_{\\text{inf}}$ be the inferred error and $E_{\\text{actual}}$ be the actual error. A logical error occurs when the combination of the actual error and the decoder's correction forms a non-trivial logical operator. This can be expressed using the symmetric difference operator $\\oplus$ as $E_{\\text{actual}} \\oplus E_{\\text{inf}} = Z_L$, where $Z_L$ is a logical operator.\n\n1.  **Inferred Error Weight:** The decoder infers the shortest path between the two adjacent defects. This path consists of the single qubit $q_{AB}$. Therefore, the weight of the inferred error is $\\mathrm{wt}(E_{\\text{inf}}) = 1$.\n\n2.  **Logical Operator Weight:** By the definition of the code distance $d$, the minimum weight of any non-trivial logical operator is $d$. To find the minimum possible weight for $E_{\\text{actual}}$, we must consider the scenario where the resulting logical error $Z_L$ has this minimum weight, i.e., $\\mathrm{wt}(Z_L) = d$.\n\n3.  **Actual Error Weight Calculation:** We can find the weight of the actual error using the property of the symmetric difference: $\\mathrm{wt}(A \\oplus B) = \\mathrm{wt}(A) + \\mathrm{wt}(B) - 2 \\cdot \\mathrm{wt}(A \\cap B)$. Rearranging for our case, we get:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{wt}(E_{\\text{actual}}) = \\mathrm{wt}(Z_L \\oplus E_{\\text{inf}}) = \\mathrm{wt}(Z_L) + \\mathrm{wt}(E_{\\text{inf}}) - 2 \\cdot \\mathrm{wt}(Z_L \\cap E_{\\text{inf}})\n    $$\n    \n4.  **Minimization:** To minimize $\\mathrm{wt}(E_{\\text{actual}})$, we must maximize the overlap term, $\\mathrm{wt}(Z_L \\cap E_{\\text{inf}})$. Since $E_{\\text{inf}}$ consists of just one qubit, the maximum possible overlap is 1 (assuming the single qubit of $E_{\\text{inf}}$ is part of the minimal-weight logical operator path).\n\n5.  **Final Result:** Substituting the values into the equation:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{wt}(E_{\\text{actual}})_{\\min} = d + 1 - 2(1) = d - 1\n    $$\nTherefore, the minimum possible weight of the actual error chain that causes this specific logical error is $d-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{d-1}$$", "id": "82660"}, {"introduction": "In real-world quantum hardware, noise is rarely uniform; some types of errors are more probable than others.

The code is stabilized by two types of operators: Pauli-X products around vertices ($A_v$) and Pauli-Z products around plaquettes ($B_p$). Errors on the data qubits create pairs of defects (anyons), which are detected by stabilizer measurements yielding an eigenvalue of $-1$. An error of type Pauli-X or Y on a data qubit can flip the state of adjacent Z-type stabilizers ($B_p$), creating Z-anyons. An error of type Pauli-Z or Y can flip the state of adjacent X-type stabilizers ($A_v$), creating X-anyons.\n\nA common decoding strategy is the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) algorithm. For the toric code, this is typically implemented by running two independent matching algorithms: one for the X-anyons on the direct lattice and one for the Z-anyons on the dual lattice. The goal of each matcher is to find the most likely set of physical errors that could have produced the observed syndrome. This corresponds to finding a perfect matching of the anyons with minimum total weight.\n\nThe weight of an edge connecting two anyons in the matching graph is calculated by finding the shortest path on the underlying physical lattice and multiplying the path length by an elemental weight $w$. This elemental weight $w$ for a single-qubit error is optimally chosen based on the error probability $q$ as the log-likelihood ratio:\n$$w = \\log\\left(\\frac{1-q}{q}\\right)$$\nwhere $q$ is the effective probability of a single-qubit error that creates the corresponding anyon type. A useful related quantity is the \"odds\" against an error, defined as $\\text{Odds} = \\frac{1-q}{q}$. Note that $\\text{Odds} = \\exp(w)$.\n\nConsider that each data qubit is affected by an independent, biased depolarizing noise channel $\\mathcal{E}$, described by the single-qubit error probabilities $p_X$, $p_Y$, and $p_Z$. The noise has a specific bias towards Z-errors, such that $p_Y = p_X$, and $p_Z = \\eta p_X$, where $\\eta$ is a positive real constant.
