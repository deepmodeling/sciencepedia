This exercise provides a foundational look into this principle by asking you to find the critical noise bias at which a decoder would find two fundamentally different error events to be equally probable. By working through this, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how noise bias directly influences the logic of an optimal decoder [@problem_id:68320].", "problem": "In the context of quantum error correction for noise-biased hardware, the performance of a decoder often depends critically on the noise parameters. Consider the toric code on an $L \\times L$ lattice. The noise is modeled by independent Pauli errors on each qubit, with probabilities $p_X$, $p_Y$, and $p_Z$ for Pauli $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ errors, respectively. The noise is biased, and the biases are characterized by the ratios $\\eta = p_Z/p_Y$ and $\\xi = p_X/p_Y$.\n\nA particular syndrome is observed. From prior characterization of the quantum processor, it is known that this syndrome can only be caused by one of two specific two-qubit error chains involving a particular pair of adjacent qubits, $q_1$ and $q_2$. A decoder, aiming to identify the most likely cause of the error, evaluates the a priori probabilities of these two possibilities:\n\n1.  **Error Chain 1 ($E_1$):** A $Y$ error on qubit $q_1$ and a $Y$ error on qubit $q_2$.\n2.  **Error Chain 2 ($E_2$):** An $X$ error on qubit $q_1$ and a $Z$ error on qubit $q_2$.\n\nThe decoder finds these two explanations to be \"equally likely\" when their a priori probabilities are identical.

For many codes, such as the XZZX surface code, different types of errors (e.g., Pauli-$X$ vs. Pauli-$Z$) generate syndromes that can be visualized as violating different sets of rules or different graphs. This practice problem models a scenario where a decoder, designed exclusively for Z-errors, encounters a syndrome created by an X-error. Your task is to determine the decoder's response, which illustrates how a biased decoder interprets all syndromes through the lens of the dominant noise, a crucial concept for understanding its failure modes [@problem_id:68341].", "problem": "A new generation of quantum hardware exhibits highly biased noise, where Pauli-Z errors are far more likely than Pauli-X or Y errors. Quantum error-correcting codes like the XZZX surface code are designed to leverage this property. In such codes, the task of decoding can be mapped to finding minimum weight paths on a graph whose vertices are the stabilizer checks and whose edges represent physical qubit errors.\n\nFor an XZZX-type code, the syndrome graph for Z-errors is different from the syndrome graph for X-errors. A decoder designed for infinitely Z-biased noise (a Z-biased decoder) will operate solely on the Z-error syndrome graph, assuming any measured syndrome must be due to Z-errors.\n\nConsider a distance-3 planar XZZX-type code with a set of 9 stabilizer checks, which we can label by integer coordinates $(i,j)$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Let's denote a stabilizer check by $S_{ij}$.\n- The **Z-error syndrome graph**, $G_Z$, has these 9 stabilizers as vertices. An edge exists between any two vertices $S_{ij}$ and $S_{i'j'}$ if they are adjacent on the $3 \\times 3$ grid (i.e., if $|i-i'| + |j-j'| = 1$). An edge in $G_Z$ between two stabilizers corresponds to a single data qubit, on which a Z-error would flip precisely those two stabilizers.\n- The **X-error syndrome graph**, $G_X$, has the same 9 stabilizers as vertices. Its edges are defined differently. There is an edge between the central stabilizer $S_{22}$ and each of its grid neighbors, i.e., vertices $(S_{22}, S_{12})$, $(S_{22}, S_{21})$, $(S_{22}, S_{23})$, and $(S_{22}, S_{32})$. An edge in $G_X$ corresponds to a single data qubit, on which an X-error would flip the two connected stabilizers.\n\nSuppose a two-qubit error $E = X_a X_b$ occurs. The error acts on two data qubits, $a$ and $b$, that are \"adjacent\" in the sense that their corresponding edges in the $G_X$ graph share a vertex. Specifically, qubit $a$ corresponds to the edge between $S_{12}$ and $S_{22}$ in $G_X$, and qubit $b$ corresponds to the edge between $S_{21}$ and $S_{22}$ in $G_X$.\n\nThis error $E$ creates a syndrome which is measured perfectly. A Z-biased decoder receives this syndrome and attempts to find a corrective action. The decoder finds the most likely cause of the syndrome by assuming it was generated by a chain of single-qubit Z-errors. This corresponds to finding a minimum-length path in the $G_Z$ graph that connects the stabilizers flipped by the error. The weight of the correction is the number of Z-errors in this minimal chain.\n\nCalculate the weight of this minimal Z-error correction chain.", "solution": "The problem asks for the weight of the minimal Z-error correction proposed by a Z-biased decoder in response to a specific two-qubit X-error.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial error and its syndrome.**\n    The error is $E = X_a X_b$.\n    Qubit $a$ corresponds to the edge $(S_{12}, S_{22})$ in the X-error syndrome graph $G_X$. A single-qubit error $X_a$ would flip the stabilizers $S_{12}$ and $S_{22}$.\n    Qubit $b$ corresponds to the edge $(S_{21}, S_{22})$ in $G_X$. A single-qubit error $X_b$ would flip the stabilizers $S_{21}$ and $S_{22}$.\n\n    The total syndrome from the error $E = X_a X_b$ is the set of stabilizers that are flipped an odd number of times.\n    - $S_{12}$ is flipped once (by $X_a$).\n    - $S_{21}$ is flipped once (by $X_b$).\n    - $S_{22}$ is flipped twice (once by $X_a$ and once by $X_b$).\n    - All other stabilizers are not flipped.\n\n    A double flip of a stabilizer returns it to its original state. Therefore, the net syndrome, i.e., the set of stabilizers that report a non-trivial measurement outcome, is $\\{S_{12}, S_{21}\\}$. These are the \"syndrome defects\".\n\n2.  **Determine the Z-biased decoder's task.**\n    The Z-biased decoder sees the syndrome defects at locations $S_{12}$ and $S_{21}$. The decoder's algorithm is to find a minimum-weight chain of Z-errors that could produce this syndrome. In the graph-based picture, this is equivalent to finding a shortest path between the syndrome vertices $S_{12}$ and $S_{21}$ in the Z-error syndrome graph $G_Z$. The weight of the correction is the length of this shortest path (number of edges).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Z-error syndrome graph $G_Z$.**\n    The graph $G_Z$ has 9 vertices, corresponding to the stabilizers $S_{ij}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The vertices are arranged in a $3 \\times 3$ grid. Edges connect adjacent vertices. The length of a path in this graph is the number of edges. The shortest path length between two vertices $S_{ij}$ and $S_{i'j'}$ is given by the Manhattan distance:\n    $$\n    d((i,j), (i',j')) = |i - i'| + |j - j'|.\n    $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the shortest path length.**\n    The decoder needs to find the shortest path between the syndrome defects $S_{12}$ and $S_{21}$. We use the Manhattan distance formula for the coordinates of the stabilizers, which are $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Path length} = d((1,2), (2,1)) = |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    $$\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The shortest path in $G_Z$ between $S_{12}$ and $S_{21}$ has a length of 2. This means the decoder postulates a two-qubit Z-error (a Z-error chain of weight 2) as the cause of the syndrome. For example, a Z-error on the qubit linking $S_{12}$ and $S_{22}$, followed by a Z-error on the qubit linking $S_{22}$ and $S_{21}$, would form a path of length 2 and explain the syndrome.

This final practice ties together the concepts of biased decoding and logical failure. Here, a single physical Y-error occurs, an event that is a composite of both X and Z-type errors. A Z-biased decoder may incorrectly assume that a more probable, but higher-weight, Z-error event was the cause. This exercise challenges you to analyze the full chain of events: from the initial physical error to the decoder's faulty correction, and finally to the resulting logical error that corrupts the stored quantum information [@problem_id:68344].", "problem": "Consider the [[5,1,3]] quantum error-correcting code, which encodes one logical qubit into five physical qubits.

This channel acts independently on each qubit. With probability $1-p$, the qubit is unaffected.

The two leading candidates are the single-qubit error $Y_1$ (probability $p_Y$) and a two-qubit error consisting only of Z-errors (probability $\\sim p_Z^2$). By inspection, the error $Z_3 Z_4$ produces the same syndrome $\\{S_1, S_3, S_4\\}$.
