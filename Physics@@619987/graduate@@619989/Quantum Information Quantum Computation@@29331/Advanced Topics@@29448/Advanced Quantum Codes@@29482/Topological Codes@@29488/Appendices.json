It consists of spin-1/2 particles (qubits) located on the vertices of a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice.

The honeycomb lattice is trivalent, meaning each vertex has a coordination number of three. The links (edges) of the lattice are colored into three types—x, y, and z—depending on their spatial orientation, such that each vertex is an endpoint for exactly one x-link, one y-link, and one z-link. The summations run over all links of a given type.\n\nConsider this model on a finite lattice constructed with periodic boundary conditions. The lattice is formed from an $L \\times L$ array of unit cells, where $L$ is a positive integer. A unit cell of the honeycomb lattice contains two distinct vertices.

Mastering this reveals how errors become visible and provides the first step towards their correction.", "problem": "The 2D color code is a type of topological quantum error-correcting code. Consider a 2D color code defined on a 4.8.8 Archimedean lattice, which is a tiling of the plane by regular squares and regular octagons, such that one square and two octagons meet at each vertex. This lattice is 3-colorable, meaning its faces (the squares and octagons, also called plaquettes) can be colored with three distinct colors (e.g., red, green, blue) such that no two adjacent plaquettes share the same color.\n\nIn this model, a qubit is located at each vertex of the lattice. The code is defined by a set of stabilizer operators associated with each plaquette. For each plaquette $p$, there are two types of stabilizers:\n$$ S_p^X = \\bigotimes_{j \\in \\partial p} X_j $$\n$$ S_p^Z = \\bigotimes_{j \\in \\partial p} Z_j $$\nwhere $\\partial p$ denotes the set of vertices (qubits) on the boundary of plaquette $p$, and $X_j, Z_j$ are the Pauli operators acting on qubit $j$. The codespace is the simultaneous +1 eigenspace of all these stabilizer operators.\n\nWhen an error $E$ occurs, some stabilizers may be violated. A stabilizer $S$ is said to be violated by an error $E$ if the two operators anticommute, i.e., $ES = -SE$.\n\nConsider a single Pauli-Y error, $E = Y_k$, acting on an arbitrary qubit $k$ in an infinitely large 4.8.8 lattice. Determine the total number of plaquette stabilizers ($S_p^X$ and $S_p^Z$ combined) that are violated by this error.", "solution": "1.

Each plaquette $p$ containing qubit $k$ has two stabilizers $S_p^X$ and $S_p^Z$ which include $X_k$ or $Z_k$ in their tensor product. Thus $E$ anticommutes with both $S_p^X$ and $S_p^Z$, violating both.\n3. In the 4.8.8 lattice, exactly three plaquettes meet at each vertex (one square and two octagons).
