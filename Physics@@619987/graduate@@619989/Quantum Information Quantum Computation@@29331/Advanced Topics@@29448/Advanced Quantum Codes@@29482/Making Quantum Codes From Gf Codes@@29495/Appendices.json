This practice provides a foundational understanding of how the properties of classical codes directly map to the error-correction capabilities of the resulting quantum code.", "problem": "In quantum error correction, Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes are a powerful class of quantum codes constructed from classical binary linear codes. Given two classical linear codes $C_1$ and $C_2$ of block length $n$, such that $C_2$ is a subcode of $C_1$ (i.e., $C_2 \\subset C_1$), one can construct a quantum code, denoted $CSS(C_1, C_2)$.\n\nThe parameters of the resulting quantum code are $[[n, k, d]]$, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits, $k$ is the number of logical qubits, and $d$ is the code distance. The number of logical qubits is given by $k = k_1 - k_2$, where $k_1$ and $k_2$ are the dimensions of $C_1$ and $C_2$, respectively.\n\nThe logical operators of the CSS code, which act on the encoded information, can be described in terms of the classical codes. A logical $Z$ operator, $\\bar{Z}$, corresponds to a tensor product of single-qubit Pauli $Z$ operators, $Z(c) = Z^{c_1} \\otimes Z^{c_2} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes Z^{c_n}$, for some binary vector $c = (c_1, \\dots, c_n)$. For the operator $Z(c)$ to be a valid (non-trivial) logical operator, the vector $c$ must be in the set $C_1 \\setminus C_2$. Similarly, a logical $X$ operator, $\\bar{X}$, is of the form $X(c)$, where $c$ must be in the set $C_2^\\perp \\setminus C_1^\\perp$. Here, $C^\\perp$ denotes the dual code of $C$.\n\nThe code distance $d$ is the minimum weight of a non-trivial logical operator. The minimum weight of a logical $X$ operator is denoted $d_X$, and the minimum weight of a logical $Z$ operator is denoted $d_Z$. They are given by:\n$$\nd_X = \\min \\{ \\text{wt}(c) \\mid c \\in C_2^\\perp \\setminus C_1^\\perp \\}\n$$\n$$\nd_Z = \\min \\{ \\text{wt}(c) \\mid c \\in C_1 \\setminus C_2 \\}\n$$\nwhere $\\text{wt}(c)$ is the Hamming weight of the vector $c$.
