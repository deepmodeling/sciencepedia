Qubits are located on the edges of the lattice. The code is defined by a set of stabilizer operators. For the purpose of this problem, we are concerned with the plaquette (or \"flux\") stabilizers and errors that violate them.\n\nA plaquette stabilizer $B_p$ is defined for each elementary square (plaquette) $p$ of the lattice as the product of Pauli-$Z$ operators on the four qubits (edges) that bound it:\n$$B_p = \\bigotimes_{j \\in \\partial p} Z_j$$\nIn the ground state (the codespace) of the system, all plaquette stabilizers have an eigenvalue of $+1$.\n\nAn error is a Pauli operator acting on one or more qubits.

A syndrome measurement reveals that exactly two plaquettes, $p_A$ and $p_B$, have been violated (i.e., their stabilizer measurements yield $-1$). The centers of these plaquettes can be described by integer coordinates on the dual lattice. Let the coordinates of the center of $p_A$ be $(0,0)$ and the center of $p_B$ be $(L_x, L_y)$, where $L_x$ and $L_y$ are non-negative integers representing the separation in a Cartesian coordinate system aligned with the lattice axes.\n\nThe weight of a Pauli error is the number of qubits on which it acts non-trivially.
