This hands-on problem invites you to explore this relationship within the concrete setting of the [[7,1,3]] Steane code, viewed as a color code. By determining the minimal error that produces a specific, partial syndrome, you will gain direct experience with how the 'colored' stabilizer generators differentially detect errors on the physical qubits [@problem_id:59756].", "problem": "The [[7,1,3]] Steane code is a quantum error-correcting code that can be represented as a color code. In this representation, the qubits are located at the vertices of a lattice, and the stabilizer generators correspond to plaquettes of three different colors (Red, Green, and Blue).\n\nConsider the [[7,1,3]] Steane code with its 7 qubits labeled by the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. The code space is defined by a set of 6 stabilizer generators, 3 of which are of Pauli-X type and 3 are of Pauli-Z type. For detecting Pauli-Z errors, we are concerned with the X-type stabilizers. Let the three independent X-type stabilizer generators be assigned colors as follows:\n-   Red Stabilizer: $S_R = X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7$\n-   Green Stabilizer: $S_G = X_2 X_3 X_6 X_7$\n-   Blue Stabilizer: $S_B = X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7$\n\nA Pauli-Z error, denoted by $E_Z = \\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{S}} Z_i$ for some subset of qubits $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, 7\\}$, is detected by a set of stabilizers corresponding to a given color if it anticommutes with at least one stabilizer generator of that color. For a CSS code like this one, we only need to check commutation with the single generator provided for each color. An error is not detected by a color set if it commutes with the corresponding generator.\n\nThe task is to find the weight of the minimal Pauli-Z error that creates a syndrome detectable by the red and green stabilizers, but not by the blue stabilizer. The weight of an error is the number of qubits on which it acts non-trivially, i.e., the size of the set $\\mathcal{S}$.", "solution": "We label the error by bits $s_i\\in\\{0,1\\}$, $s_i=1$ iff $Z_i$ acts.

This protection is embodied by logical operators, which are non-local string-like objects that commute with all stabilizers yet act non-trivially on the encoded information. This exercise provides a sharp, geometric insight into the structure of these logical operators on a 2D color code lattice, demonstrating how their fundamental anti-commutation relations arise from their physical intersection [@problem_id:59782].", "problem": "A quantum error-correcting code known as the 6.6.6 color code is constructed on a 2D honeycomb lattice. Qubits are located at the vertices of the lattice. The faces of the lattice, which are all hexagons, are 3-colorable, say with colors Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B). For each hexagonal face (plaquette) $p$, there are stabilizer generators of the form $A_p = \\prod_{v \\in p} X_v$ and $B_p = \\prod_{v \\in p} Z_v$, where $X_v$ and $Z_v$ are the Pauli operators for the qubit at vertex $v$.\n\nConsider a square patch of this 6.6.6 color code. The patch is defined to have four boundaries. Two opposite boundaries are of color Red, and the other two opposite boundaries are of color Green. This configuration defines a code that stores a single logical qubit.\n\nLogical operators for this code are strings of Pauli operators acting on qubits along paths connecting boundaries of the same color. We define two such logical operators, $\\bar{X}_1$ and $\\bar{X}_2$:\n1.  $\\bar{X}_1$ is a string of Pauli-X operators supported on a path of qubits $P_1$.

A single fault in an ancilla qubit during measurement can corrupt the data, so ancillas themselves must be encoded. This advanced practice guides you through the construction of a fault-tolerant ancilla state, as used in the Shor measurement scheme, by combining simpler codes into a complex, stabilized state designed to reliably measure a single logical operator on a 6.6.6 color code [@problem_id:59895].", "problem": "The two-dimensional 6.6.6 color code, also known as the triangular color code, is a topological stabilizer code defined on a trivalent lattice tiling the plane with hexagons. The stabilizers of this code are associated with the faces (plaquettes) and vertices of the lattice. For a given coloring of the faces (e.g., red, green, blue), a face operator is a product of Pauli operators acting on the qubits at the vertices of that face. A hexagonal face operator has weight six.\n\nMeasuring these stabilizer operators is fundamental to quantum error correction. To perform this measurement fault-tolerantly, one can use an ancilla system that is itself encoded. Consider the task of measuring a weight-six red face operator, which we can write as $F_R = \\bigotimes_{k=1}^{6} X_k$, acting on six data qubits $\\{q_1, \\dots, q_6\\}$. A common fault-tolerant strategy is the Shor measurement scheme, which uses a multi-qubit ancilla state.\n\nTo protect against at least one physical error on the ancilla during the procedure, we construct an encoded ancilla state as follows:\n1.  The ancilla system comprises six logical qubits.\n2.  Each logical qubit is encoded using a 3-qubit $Z$-basis repetition code. The logical states are $|0_L\\rangle = |000\\rangle$ and $|1_L\\rangle = |111\\rangle$.\n3.

This state $|\\Psi_A\\rangle$ is a stabilizer state, uniquely defined by a set of $N$ independent and commuting stabilizer generators.\n\nA standard generating set for the stabilizer group $\\mathcal{S}_A$ of $|\\Psi_A\\rangle$ is constructed by combining the stabilizers of the individual code blocks with the stabilizers of the logical state.\n- For each of the six 3-qubit blocks, indexed by $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$, the two stabilizer generators are of the form $Z_1Z_2$ and $Z_2Z_3$.\n- For the logical 6-qubit GHZ state, the stabilizer generators are $\\{\\bar{Z}_k \\bar{Z}_{k+1}\\}_{k=1}^5$ and $\\prod_{k=1}^6 \\bar{X}_k$. These are mapped to operators on the physical ancilla qubits by replacing each logical Pauli with its corresponding representation.
