Its elementary excitations are abelian anyons: the electric charge $e$, the magnetic flux $m$, and their composite, the dyon $\\epsilon=em$. The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code depends on the topology of the manifold on which it is defined. For the purposes of this problem, you may take the following as given: on a Mobius strip, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code has a GSD of 2. The two-dimensional ground state space $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{GS}}$ can be spanned by two orthonormal states, $\\{|\\psi_1\\rangle, |\\psi_e\\rangle\\}$. These basis states can be understood as arising from the two sectors of the parent theory on a cylinder that are invariant under the glide reflection that turns the cylinder into a Mobius strip, corresponding to the identity (1) and electric ($e$) anyon flux propagating along the cylinder.\n\nNow, consider this system in the presence of a global on-site $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, represented by a unitary operator $U$. This symmetry enriches the topological order, leading to a symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phase. The defining characteristic of this SET phase is how the symmetry acts on the anyons. We specify that the symmetry fractionalizes non-trivially on the electric anyon $e$. This means that a state with an isolated $e$ anyon is not invariant under the symmetry operation, but instead transforms projectively, acquiring a phase of $-1$. The magnetic anyon $m$, in contrast, transforms trivially (with a phase of $+1$). The identity anyon $1$ is always invariant. The transformation property of the dyon $\\epsilon$ is determined by the fusion rules.

The symmetry does not permute the anyon types, but rather acts projectively on them, a phenomenon known as symmetry fractionalization. For the abelian group $G$, this means an anyon $a$ transforms under a symmetry operation $g \\in G$ by acquiring a phase factor given by a character $\\chi_a(g)$. The specific symmetry fractionalization class is defined by the characters of the fundamental anyons:\n- The electric charge $e$ transforms under the character $\\chi_e$, defined by its values on the generators: $\\chi_e(g_X) = -1$ and $\\chi_e(g_Y) = 1$.\n- The magnetic flux $m$ transforms under the character $\\chi_m$, defined by: $\\chi_m(g_X) = 1$ and $\\chi_m(g_Y) = -1$.\nThe transformation property of the composite anyon $\\psi$ is constrained by the fusion rule $\\psi = e \\times m$.\n\nWe then \"gauge\" the $\\mathbb{Z}_2^{(X)}$ subgroup of the full symmetry group $G$.
