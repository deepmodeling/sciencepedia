This exercise provides a hands-on look at generating a flux anyon from the ground state by applying local operators to the edge degrees of freedom. By tracking the changes in the plaquette holonomy, you will directly see how these fundamental excitations emerge from the underlying gauge structure of the model [@problem_id:159497].", "problem": "The quantum double model for a finite group $G$, denoted $D(G)$, is a lattice model exhibiting topological order. In this problem, we consider the $D(G)$ model on a two-dimensional square lattice where the degrees of freedom are group elements $g_e \\in G$ located on the edges $e$ of the lattice.\n\nThe model's Hamiltonian involves plaquette operators that measure magnetic flux. For any given plaquette $p$, the magnetic flux is determined by the holonomy $g_p$, which is the ordered product of group elements on its boundary edges. Let's establish a convention for the lattice and holonomy calculation. All horizontal edges are oriented to the right, and all vertical edges are oriented upwards. For a plaquette $p$, we trace its boundary counter-clockwise starting from its bottom-left vertex. The boundary consists of four edges: bottom ($e_b$), right ($e_r$), top ($e_t$), and left ($e_l$). The holonomy is given by $g_p = g_{e_l}^{-1} g_{e_t}^{-1} g_{e_r} g_{e_b}$.\n\nThe ground state of the system is one in which all plaquettes have trivial flux, i.e., $g_p=e$ for all $p$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$. An elementary excitation, known as a magnetic flux or anyon, corresponds to a state where $g_p \\neq e$ for some plaquette $p$. The type of this anyon is characterized by the conjugacy class of $g_p$ in $G$.\n\nFluxes can be created by local operators. An operator $L_h^e$ acts on a single edge $e$ by left-multiplying its group element by $h \\in G$, i.e., $g_e \\to hg_e$.\n\nConsider the $D(S_3)$ model, where $S_3$ is the symmetric group on three elements. The elements are $\\{e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)\\}$, with composition corresponding to function composition from right to left (e.g., $(13)(12)$ sends $1\\to2\\to2$, $2\\to1\\to3$, $3\\to3\\to1$, resulting in the cycle $(123)$). The system is initially in a ground state. For a particular plaquette $p_0$, a gauge is fixed such that the group elements on its left and bottom edges are the identity: $g_{e_l} = e$ and $g_{e_b} = e$.\n\nStarting from this state, a sequence of two operations is performed:\n1. The operator $L_h^{e_b}$ with $h=(12)$ is applied to the bottom edge $e_b$ of $p_0$.\n2. Subsequently, the operator $L_f^{e_l}$ with $f=(13)$ is applied to the left edge $e_l$ of $p_0$.\n\nThese operations create a net magnetic flux in plaquette $p_0$.
