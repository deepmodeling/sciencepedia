The Kirby calculus provides a set of rules for manipulating diagrams of framed links in the 3-sphere $S^3$, where these manipulations leave the underlying 3-manifold defined by Dehn surgery on the link invariant.\n\nA **framed link** is a collection of disjoint knots $L = K_1 \\cup K_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup K_n$ embedded in $S^3$, where each component knot $K_i$ is assigned an integer $f_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, called its **framing**. The framing specifies a \"ribbon\" structure, or equivalently, the linking number of the knot with a nearby parallel copy of itself (a push-off).\n\nA fundamental operation in Kirby calculus is the **handleslide**. Given two distinct components $K_i$ and $K_j$ of a framed link $L$, a handleslide of $K_i$ over $K_j$ transforms the link $L$ into a new link $L'$. In this operation, the component $K_i$ is replaced by a new knot $K_i'$, while all other components (including $K_j$) remain unchanged. The new knot $K_i'$ is topologically equivalent to the connected sum of the original knots, $K_i' \\cong K_i \\# K_j$.\n\nThe integer framing $f_i'$ of the new knot $K_i'$ is determined by the framings of the original knots and their linking number, $\\text{lk}(K_i, K_j)$, according to the formula:\n$$ f_i' = f_i + f_j + 2 \\cdot \\text{lk}(K_i, K_j) $$\n\nConsider a 2-component link $L=K_1 \\cup K_2$ with the following properties:\n1.

A framed link is a link where each component knot is thickened into a narrow ribbon. The framing of a component is an integer that quantifies the twisting of this ribbon. For a knot diagram projected onto a plane, a standard choice is the **blackboard framing**, where the framing integer is equal to the writhe of the diagram (the sum of signed crossings of the component with itself). We will use the integer framing coefficient directly, denoted by $f$.\n\nConsider a two-component link $L = K_1 \\cup K_2$ in the 3-sphere $S^3$, where both $K_1$ and $K_2$ are unknots.

Each component $K_i$ is assigned an integer framing $f_i$.\n\nA **handleslide** is a fundamental operation (a Kirby move) that transforms one component of a link by sliding it over another. When component $K_1$ (the sliding component) is slid over component $K_2$ (the stationary component), $K_1$ is replaced by a new component $K_1'$. Topologically, $K_1'$ is the connected sum of $K_1$ and a \"pushoff\" of $K_2$. The pushoff of $K_2$ is a copy of $K_2$ shifted slightly along the direction of its framing vector field. The component $K_2$ and its framing $f_2$ are unaffected by this move.\n\nThe task is to completely unlink the two components, i.e., to transform the link into a new link $L' = K_1' \\cup K_2$ where the final linking number is $\\text{lk}(K_1', K_2) = 0$. This unlinking is to be achieved via a single handleslide of $K_1$ over $K_2$.\n\nGiven that the framing of the sliding component is $f_1 = 0$, determine the required integer blackboard framing, $f_2$, of the stationary component $K_2$ that achieves this unlinking.

The goal is to find the framing $f_2$ of $K_2$ such that after a single handleslide of $K_1$ over $K_2$, the new linking number $\\text{lk}(K_1', K_2) = 0$, where $K_1'$ is the new component after the handleslide.\n\nThe handleslide operation replaces $K_1$ with $K_1'$, which is the connected sum of $K_1$ and a pushoff of $K_2$ along its framing vector field. The pushoff of $K_2$ is a curve parallel to $K_2$, and its linking number with $K_2$ is exactly the framing $f_2$ by definition.\n\nSince the connected sum is performed using a small tube away from $K_2$, the linking number of $K_1'$ with $K_2$ is the sum of the linking number of $K_1$ with $K_2$ and the linking number of the pushoff of $K_2$ with $K_2$.

A framed link is a link where each component is assigned an integer framing, which specifies how to glue a solid torus back into the complement of a tubular neighborhood of the component. The resulting 3-manifold is uniquely determined by the framed link.\n\nThe **Whitehead link**, denoted $W$, is a two-component link where each component is an unknot, and their linking number is zero.

The framings are $(0, n)$ respectively. The goal is to find the value of $n$ for which Dehn surgery on this link yields the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\n2.  **Apply a Kirby Move (Handleslide):** A standard technique in Kirby calculus to simplify this link is to perform a handleslide. We will slide component $K_1$ over component $K_2$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Transformation:**\n    *   The component $K_2$ and its framing $n$ remain unchanged by this move.\n    *   The component $K_1$ is replaced by a new component $K_1'$. After the slide, $K_1'$ and $K_2$ are topologically two unlinked unknots.\n    *   The framing of the new component $K_1'$ is calculated using the handleslide formula: $f_1' = f_1 + f_2 + 2 \\cdot \\text{lk}(K_1, K_2)$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the New Framing:** We substitute the given values into the formula:\n    *   $f_1 = 0$\n    *   $f_2 = n$\n    *   $\\text{lk}(K_1, K_2) = 0$\n    *   This gives $f_1' = 0 + n + 2 \\cdot 0 = n$.\n\n5.  **Describe the Resulting Link:** After the handleslide, the original framed Whitehead link is equivalent to a new framed link consisting of two unlinked unknots. One component (the new $K_1'$) has framing $n$, and the other component (the original $K_2$) also has framing $n$.\n\n6.  **Determine the Result of Surgery:** Dehn surgery on a link of two unlinked components results in the connected sum of the manifolds obtained by surgery on each component individually.\n    *   Surgery on a single unknot with framing $n$ yields the lens space $L(n, 1)$.\n    *   Therefore, surgery on our resulting link yields the connected sum $L(n, 1) \\# L(n, 1)$.\n\n7.  **Solve for the Condition:** We require the resulting manifold to be $S^3$. The lens space $L(n, 1)$ is homeomorphic to $S^3$ if and only if $n = \\pm 1$. In this case, the surgery result is $S^3 \\# S^3$, which is homeomorphic to $S^3$.
