The celebrated Verlinde formula provides a powerful bridge between these two, allowing the calculation of fusion rules directly from the S-matrix. This exercise [@problem_id:179578] provides hands-on practice in applying the Verlinde formula to the $SU(2)_3$ TQFT, a paradigmatic example of a non-Abelian anyon theory.", "problem": "The study of (2+1)-dimensional Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) provides a powerful framework for understanding exotic phases of matter, such as those exhibiting fractional statistics. A key example of such a theory is the $SU(2)_k$ Chern-Simons theory, characterized by an integer level $k$.\n\nThe elementary excitations in this theory, often called anyons or primary fields, are labeled by a spin $j$, where $j \\in \\{0, 1/2, 1, \\dots, k/2\\}$. The behavior of these anyons under braiding and fusion is encoded in the modular data of the theory, specifically the modular S-matrix. The S-matrix is a unitary, symmetric matrix whose entries $S_{ij}$ encode the mutual statistics of anyons $i$ and $j$. For the $SU(2)_k$ TQFT, its elements are given by:\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{k+2}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi(2i+1)(2j+1)}{k+2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $i, j$ are the spin labels of the primary fields.\n\nThe fusion rules of the theory, which describe how two anyons combine, can be determined from the S-matrix using the Verlinde formula. The fusion coefficient $N_{ij}^l$ represents the number of distinct ways that anyons $i$ and $j$ can fuse to produce anyon $l$, mathematically expressed as $i \\otimes j = \\bigoplus_l N_{ij}^l l$. The Verlinde formula is:\n$$\nN_{ij}^l = \\sum_p \\frac{S_{ip} S_{jp} S_{lp}^*}{S_{0p}}\n$$\nwhere the sum is over all primary fields $p$ in the theory, $S_{lp}^*$ is the complex conjugate of $S_{lp}$, and the field labeled '0' is the vacuum (identity) field.\n\nConsider the $SU(2)_3$ TQFT.
