In three or more spatial dimensions, exchanging two particles twice is topologically equivalent to not exchanging them at all. However, in two-dimensional systems, the paths of particles can form non-trivial braids in spacetime. The group describing these exchanges is the braid group $B_n$, not the permutation group $S_n$. The elements of $B_n$ are called braids on $n$ strands. The group is generated by elementary exchanges $\\sigma_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n-1$, where $\\sigma_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th strand crossing over the $(i+1)$-th strand. These generators satisfy the relations:\n1.  $\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = \\sigma_j \\sigma_i$ for $|i-j| > 1$.\n2.  $\\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+1} \\sigma_i = \\sigma_{i+1} \\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+1}$ for $1 \\le i \\le n-2$.\n\nThe quantum states of particles exhibiting this behavior, known as anyons, transform according to unitary representations of the braid group.
