Their Conway polynomials are related by the formula:\n    $$ \\nabla_{L_+}(z) - \\nabla_{L_-}(z) = z \\nabla_{L_0}(z) $$\n3.  **Unlink property:** The Conway polynomial of any split link (a link whose components can be separated by a plane) is zero.

The standard diagram of the trefoil knot can be resolved into the unknot ($U_1$) and the Hopf link ($L2a1$).
