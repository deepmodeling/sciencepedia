This is achieved by systematically amplifying the noise in a quantum circuit in a controlled manner, measuring the expectation value at different noise levels, and then extrapolating the results back to the zero-noise limit.\n\nA common method for noise amplification for a gate $U$ is to replace it with the sequence $U(U^\\dagger U)^k$ for integer $k \\ge 0$. This sequence is logically equivalent to $U$ but involves a total of $c=2k+1$ gates, thus amplifying the noise associated with each gate application. For a CNOT gate, its unitary $U_{CNOT}$ is self-adjoint ($U_{CNOT}^\\dagger = U_{CNOT}$), so this procedure corresponds to replacing a single CNOT with a sequence of $c=2k+1$ CNOTs.\n\nConsider the preparation of a two-qubit Bell state, $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle)$, from the initial state $|00\\rangle$. The circuit consists of an ideal Hadamard gate applied to the first qubit, followed by a CNOT gate with the first qubit as control and the second as target.\n\nThe CNOT gate is subject to a depolarizing noise model. Each application of the CNOT gate is described by the quantum channel $\\mathcal{N}(\\rho)$, defined as:\n$$ \\mathcal{N}(\\rho) = (1-p) U_{CNOT} \\rho U_{CNOT}^\\dagger + p \\frac{I_4}{4} $$\nwhere $p$ is the error probability, $\\rho$ is the two-qubit state, and $I_4$ is the two-qubit identity matrix.\n\nTo mitigate the error, the ZNE procedure described above is used. The single CNOT gate in the circuit is replaced by $c$ sequential applications of the noisy CNOT channel $\\mathcal{N}$, where $c$ is the amplification factor. The fidelity of the resulting state $\\rho_{final}(c)$ with the ideal Bell state $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$ is then measured. This fidelity is given by $F(c) = \\langle\\Phi^+ | \\rho_{final}(c) | \\Phi^+\\rangle$.\n\nSuppose the fidelities are measured for amplification factors $c=1$ and $c=3$, yielding the values $F_1$ and $F_3$, respectively.
