In its canonical form, two identical single photons are simultaneously directed into the two input ports of a symmetric 50:50 beam splitter. Quantum interference dictates that the two photons will always exit the beam splitter through the same output port, a phenomenon known as photon bunching. This leads to a null in the coincidence count rate between photodetectors placed at the two output ports. The quality of this interference is quantified by the HOM visibility, defined as $V = (C_\\infty - C_0) / C_\\infty$, where $C_0$ is the coincidence rate when the photons are indistinguishable (zero time delay), and $C_\\infty$ is the rate when they are distinguishable (large time delay). In an ideal setup, $C_0=0$ and the visibility is $V=1$.\n\nConsider a more realistic HOM interferometer where the two photodetectors at the output ports are non-ideal.
