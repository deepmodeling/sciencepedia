The stabilizer $S_1$ is a product of Pauli-$Z$ operators on the four data qubits neighboring $A_1$, and $S_2$ is a similar product for the data qubits neighboring $A_2$.\n\nThe measurement protocol for each ancilla is based on a standard circuit using Controlled-$Z$ (CZ) gates. For an ancilla $A_i$ and its stabilizer $S_i = \\bigotimes_{k \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} Z_k$ (where $\\mathcal{N}(i)$ is the set of neighboring data qubits), the measurement circuit consists of the following steps:\n1.
