This phenomenon is used to create controlled interactions for implementing two-qubit quantum gates. Consider a system of two identical atoms, initially in their ground state and separated by a distance $R$. A laser system is used to excite these atoms to a specific high-lying electronic state, known as a Rydberg state.\n\nWhen both atoms are simultaneously in this Rydberg state, they experience a strong, long-range van der Waals interaction. This interaction shifts their collective energy level. The potential energy for this interaction can be effectively modeled by the expression $V(R) = -C_6/R^6$, where $C_6$ is a positive constant known as the van der Waals coefficient, which depends on the specific Rydberg state chosen.\n\nThe Rydberg blockade effect arises when this interaction energy shift is significant enough to detune the second atom from the laser's resonance, thereby preventing its excitation. A standard criterion for the onset of a strong blockade is when the magnitude of the interaction energy, $|V(R)|$, is equal to the energy uncertainty of the Rydberg state. This energy uncertainty, also called the natural linewidth, is fundamentally linked to the finite lifetime of the state, denoted by $\\tau$.\n\nDerive a symbolic expression for the \"blockade radius,\" $R_b$. This is defined as the specific interatomic distance at which the magnitude of the van der Waals interaction energy is precisely equal to the natural linewidth of the Rydberg state (expressed in energy units).
