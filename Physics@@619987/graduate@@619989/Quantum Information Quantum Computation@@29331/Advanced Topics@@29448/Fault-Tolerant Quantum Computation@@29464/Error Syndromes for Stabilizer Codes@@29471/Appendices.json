It is a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, and its stabilizer group can be generated by the following six operators, where $X_j$ and $Z_j$ are the Pauli-X and Pauli-Z operators acting on qubit $j$:\n$S_1 = Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7$\n$S_2 = Z_2 Z_3 Z_6 Z_7$\n$S_3 = Z_4 Z_5 Z_6 Z_7$\n$S_4 = X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7$\n$S_5 = X_2 X_3 X_6 X_7$\n$S_6 = X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7$\n\nWhen a Pauli error $E$ occurs, it may or may not commute with the stabilizer generators.

The error $E$ produces the exact same syndrome as a single Pauli $X$ error on qubit 1 (denoted as $X_1$).\n2.

An error $F$ and a stabilizer generator $g_k$ yield a syndrome eigenvalue of $-1$ if they anticommute, and $+1$ if they commute. The lowest-weight error that produces this specific syndrome is $X_1$ itself, as its weight is 1.

The initial error is $E$, and the correction operator is $C=X_1$. The net transformation is the product $C E = X_1 E$. For this net transformation to be equivalent to a logical $\\bar{Z}$ operator, it must belong to the coset of the stabilizer group $\\mathcal{S}$ corresponding to $\\bar{Z}$.

The syndrome of an error $F$ is determined by its commutation relations with the stabilizer generators $g_k$.\nFor any generator $g_k$, its commutation with $E$ is:\n$$ g_k E g_k = g_k (X_1 \\bar{Z} S) g_k = (g_k X_1 g_k) (g_k \\bar{Z} g_k) (g_k S g_k) $$\nBy definition, a logical operator $\\bar{Z}$ commutes with all stabilizer generators ($g_k \\bar{Z} g_k = \\bar{Z}$). Also, any element $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$ commutes with any generator $g_k$ ($g_k S g_k = S$), since the group $\\mathcal{S}$ is Abelian.\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ g_k E g_k = (g_k X_1 g_k) \\bar{Z} S $$\nIf $g_k$ commutes with $X_1$, then $g_k X_1 g_k = X_1$, and $g_k E g_k = X_1 \\bar{Z} S = E$. So $E$ commutes with $g_k$.\nIf $g_k$ anticommutes with $X_1$, then $g_k X_1 g_k = -X_1$, and $g_k E g_k = -X_1 \\bar{Z} S = -E$. So $E$ anticommutes with $g_k$.\nThe commutation relations of $E$ with all $g_k$ are identical to those of $X_1$. Thus, $E$ has the same syndrome as $X_1$.
