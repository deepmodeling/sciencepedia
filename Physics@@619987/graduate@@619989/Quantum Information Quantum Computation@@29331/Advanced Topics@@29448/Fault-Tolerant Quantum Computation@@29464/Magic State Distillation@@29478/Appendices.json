This calculation reveals the characteristic error suppression that makes distillation an indispensable tool for building a quantum computer.", "problem": "In fault-tolerant quantum computation, non-Clifford gates such as the $T$ gate are essential for achieving universality. Since these gates are notoriously difficult to implement with high fidelity, protocols for \"magic state distillation\" are employed. These protocols take multiple noisy copies of a \"magic state\" as input and produce a single copy with much higher fidelity. The purified magic state can then be used to implement the desired non-Clifford gate via a teleportation-based circuit.\n\nA key magic state for the $T$ gate, $$T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{i\\pi/4} \\end{pmatrix},$$ is the state $|A\\rangle = T|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + e^{i\\pi/4}|1\\rangle)$.\nConsider a supply of noisy magic states, where each state is described by the density matrix\n$$ \\rho_{in} = (1-\\epsilon) |A\\rangle\\langle A| + \\epsilon |A^{\\perp}\\rangle\\langle A^{\\perp}| $$\nHere, $|A^{\\perp}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle - e^{i\\pi/4}|1\\rangle)$ is the state orthogonal to $|A\\rangle$, and $\\epsilon$ is the initial error probability. The initial fidelity of these states is $F_{in} = \\langle A|\\rho_{in}|A\\rangle = 1-\\epsilon$. It can be shown that this error model is equivalent to a quantum channel that applies a Pauli $Z$ error to the ideal state $|A\\rangle$ with probability $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe 15-to-1 magic state distillation protocol, first proposed by Bravyi and Kitaev, takes 15 copies of $\\rho_{in}$ and attempts to produce one higher-fidelity state $\\rho_{out}$. The protocol is based on the [[15, 1, 3]] quantum Reed-Muller code. It works by encoding the logical state into 15 physical qubits and then measuring the stabilizer generators of the code. If the measurement syndrome is trivial (all outcomes are $+1$), the output state is accepted. Otherwise, it is discarded.\n\nFor your calculation, you will need the following essential properties of the [[15, 1, 3]] code used in this protocol, which is a CSS code derived from the classical $[15, 11, 3]$ Hamming code:\n1.  The code has a distance of $d=3$. This implies that all error patterns affecting one or two qubits are detected by the stabilizer measurements.\n2.  The error model corresponds to Pauli $Z$ errors. An error operator consisting of a product of $Z$s on a set of qubits $S$, denoted $Z_S$, is undetected if it commutes with all stabilizers. For this specific code, this occurs if $S$ is a codeword in the classical [15, 11, 3] Hamming code.\n3.  If an undetected error occurs, it corrupts the output state, causing a logical error. The lowest weight of such error operators is 3. The number of classical codewords of weight 3 in the $[15, 11, 3]$ Hamming code is exactly 35.\n\nAssuming the initial error probability $\\epsilon$ is small, calculate the fidelity $F_{out}$ of the output state $\\rho_{out}$ from the 15-to-1 distillation protocol. Your answer should be an expression in terms of $\\epsilon$, accurate to the lowest non-vanishing order of $\\epsilon$.", "solution": "The fidelity of the output state, $ F_{\\text{out}} $, is the probability that the output state is correct given that it is accepted.
