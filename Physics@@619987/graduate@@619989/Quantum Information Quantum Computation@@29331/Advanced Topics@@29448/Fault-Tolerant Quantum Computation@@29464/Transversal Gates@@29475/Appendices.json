An error operator anticommutes with a stabilizer generator if it anticommutes with an odd number of Pauli operators within that generator.\n    The error is $Z_1 = Z \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I \\otimes I$.\n    The $X$-type generators are:\n    -   $g_1 = X_2 X_3 X_6 X_7$: $[Z_1, g_1] = 0$ as they act on different qubits.\n    -   $g_2 = X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7$: $[Z_1, g_2] = Z_1(X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7) - (X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7)Z_1$. Since $Z_1$ commutes with $X_3, X_5, X_7$ but anticommutes with $X_1$ (i.e., $Z_1 X_1 = -X_1 Z_1$), we find that $Z_1$ anticommutes with $g_2$. $\\{Z_1, g_2\\} = 0$.\n    -   $g_3 = X_1 X_2 X_5 X_6$: Similarly, $\\{Z_1, g_3\\} = 0$ due to the $X_1$ term.\n    The $Z$-type generators ($g_4, g_5, g_6$) are products of Pauli-Z operators. Since $[Z_1, Z_j] = 0$ for all $j$, $Z_1$ commutes with all $Z$-type generators.\n\n    We have found that the error operator $Z_1$ anticommutes with at least one stabilizer generator (in this case, $g_2$ and $g_3$). Let's pick $g_2 = X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7$.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the inner product:**\n    Let $|\\psi\\rangle \\equiv |\\bar{+}\\rangle_L$. We want to compute $\\langle\\psi|Z_1|\\psi\\rangle$.\n    Since $|\\psi\\rangle$ is in the codespace, it is a $+1$ eigenstate of $g_2$:\n    $$ g_2 |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle $$\n    We can insert $g_2$ into the inner product without changing its value:\n    $$ \\langle\\psi| Z_1 |\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\psi| Z_1 (g_2 |\\psi\\rangle) = \\langle\\psi| Z_1 g_2 |\\psi\\rangle $$\n    Now, use the anticommutation relation $\\{Z_1, g_2\\} = Z_1 g_2 + g_2 Z_1 = 0$, which means $Z_1 g_2 = -g_2 Z_1$:\n    $$ \\langle\\psi| Z_1 g_2 |\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\psi| (-g_2 Z_1) |\\psi\\rangle = - \\langle\\psi| g_2 Z_1 |\\psi\\rangle $$\n    The stabilizer generators are Hermitian operators ($g_2^\\dagger = g_2$). Therefore, we can move $g_2$ to act on the bra state $\\langle\\psi|$:\n    $$ - \\langle\\psi| g_2 Z_1 |\\psi\\rangle = - \\langle g_2 \\psi| Z_1 |\\psi\\rangle $$\n    Since $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a state in the codespace, $g_2$ acting on it from the left also gives $+1$ eigenvalue: $\\langle\\psi|g_2^\\dagger = \\langle\\psi|g_2 = \\langle\\psi|$. So, $\\langle g_2 \\psi| = \\langle\\psi|$.\n    $$ - \\langle g_2 \\psi| Z_1 |\\psi\\rangle = - \\langle\\psi| Z_1 |\\psi\\rangle $$\n    We have thus derived the identity:\n    $$ \\langle\\psi| Z_1 |\\psi\\rangle = - \\langle\\psi| Z_1 |\\psi\\rangle $$\n    The only complex number $c$ that satisfies $c = -c$ is $c=0$. Therefore,\n    $$ \\langle\\bar{+}|_L Z_1 |\\bar{+}\\rangle_L = 0 $$\n    This result has a clear physical interpretation: any error operator that anticommutes with a stabilizer maps the entire codespace to an orthogonal error space. The state $|\\psi_{final}\\rangle = Z_1|\\bar{+}\\rangle_L$ is in an error subspace which is orthogonal to the codespace $\\mathcal{C}$ where $|\\psi_{ideal}\\rangle=|\\bar{+}\\rangle_L$ resides.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final fidelity:**\n    Substituting this result back into the fidelity expression:\n    $$ F = |0|^2 = 0 $$\n\nThe fidelity between the final state and the ideal state is zero.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{0} $$", "id": "181638"}, {"introduction": "While the Clifford group gates are often transversal for many stabilizer codes, achieving a universal set of fault-tolerant gates is more challenging.
