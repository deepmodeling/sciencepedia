This means the total quantum state of the combined system, which includes the black hole and its emitted Hawking radiation, remains a pure state at all times.\n\nConsider a large, isolated, non-rotating, and uncharged (Schwarzschild) black hole of initial mass $M_0$. It slowly emits Hawking radiation, causing its mass to decrease. Let $S_{rad}$ be the entanglement entropy of the total radiation emitted when the black hole's mass has decreased by a small amount $\\Delta M$, where $\\Delta M \\ll M_0$.\n\nIn this early-time regime, the entanglement entropy of the radiation is well-approximated by the total thermal entropy created.

This practice ([@problem_id:145152]) moves beyond a single evaporating black hole to a more complex system of three entangled black holes, modeled as a three-boundary wormhole. By applying the island rule, you will uncover a surprising feature of the late-time radiation: a negative tripartite information, which is a hallmark of genuine multipartite entanglement and a direct consequence of \"replica wormhole\" geometries connecting the black hole interiors.", "problem": "The island paradigm provides a new perspective on the black hole information paradox by introducing a novel rule for calculating the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation. This rule, known as the \"island formula\" or \"quantum extremal surface (QES) formula\", states that the von Neumann entropy of a portion of the radiation $R$ is given by:\n$$\nS(R) = \\min_{\\mathcal{I}} \\operatorname{ext}_{\\mathcal{I}} \\left[ \\frac{\\text{Area}(\\partial \\mathcal{I})}{4G_N} + S_{\\text{vN, matter}}(R \\cup \\mathcal{I}) \\right]\n$$\nHere, one extremizes the generalized entropy over all possible spatial regions $\\mathcal{I}$ (the \"island\") in the gravitating spacetime, and then minimizes over the different extrema. In 2D Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, the gravitational term $\\frac{\\text{Area}}{4G_N}$ is replaced by a term proportional to the value of the dilaton field, $\\phi$, at the boundary of the island, $\\partial\\mathcal{I}$.\n\nConsider a three-boundary wormhole constructed in JT gravity. This geometry is dual to a tripartite quantum state shared among three non-gravitating reservoirs, or \"baths,\" labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$. These baths are coupled to the three mouths of the wormhole and collect the subsequent Hawking radiation. The entire system is in a pure state. Let $S_{BH}$ be the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy associated with each of the three initially identical black hole horizons. We are interested in the information-theoretic properties of the baths after the scrambling time, when the system has reached a late-time steady state.\n\nFrom the application of the island rule to this specific geometry at late times, the following entanglement entropies for the baths are obtained:\n1.  The entropy of a single bath, for instance $A$, is determined by an island forming behind the corresponding horizon. This calculation yields an entropy equal to the thermal entropy of the black hole: $S(A) = S_{BH}$. By the symmetry of the setup, $S(B) = S(C) = S_{BH}$.\n2.  For the union of two baths, say $A \\cup B$, the island rule requires comparing the generalized entropy for different island configurations. The two competing dominant configurations at late times are:\n    a) Two disconnected islands, one associated with bath $A$ and one with bath $B$. This configuration gives an entropy $S(A \\cup B)_{\\text{disconnected}} = S(A) + S(B)$.\n    b) A single, connected island whose geometry bridges the spacetime regions behind the horizons of $A$ and $B$. This is a manifestation of the wormhole connecting the interiors.
