{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Aharonov-Bohm effect provides the canonical example of a geometric phase, where a charged particle acquires a quantum phase by traversing a region with zero magnetic field but a non-zero vector potential. This exercise explores the topological nature of this phase on a torus, a surface with non-trivial loops. By calculating the phase for a particle moving along a $(p,q)$-torus knot, you will see how it depends solely on the winding numbers $(p, q)$ of the path and the fundamental magnetic fluxes, not the specific geometry of the torus or the path taken [@problem_id:87475].", "problem": "A particle of mass $m$ and electric charge $e$ is constrained to move on the surface of a torus. The torus is defined by a major radius $R$ and a minor radius $r$. Its surface can be parameterized by two angles: the toroidal angle $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ and the poloidal angle $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nTwo separate, idealized magnetic fields are present. The first creates a constant magnetic flux $\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}$ directed along the axis of rotational symmetry of the torus (the $z$-axis), confined to the region inside the torus \"hole\" ($r < \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} < R-r$). The second creates a constant magnetic flux $\\Phi_{\\text{pol}}$ that is confined entirely within the tube of the torus itself, circulating in the poloidal direction. Consequently, the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is zero everywhere on the surface of the torus where the particle moves, but the magnetic vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is not.\n\nThe particle travels along a specific closed path $C$ on the torus surface, known as a $(p,q)$-torus knot. This path is defined by the property that it winds $p$ times in the toroidal direction (around the $z$-axis) and $q$ times in the poloidal direction (around the torus tube) before closing on itself. Here, $p$ and $q$ are coprime positive integers.\n\nCalculate the Aharonov-Bohm phase $\\Delta\\varphi_{AB}$ acquired by the particle's wave function after it traverses the closed path $C$ once. Express your answer in terms of the given parameters $e, \\hbar, p, q, \\Phi_{\\text{tor}}$, and $\\Phi_{\\text{pol}}$.", "solution": "The Aharonov-Bohm phase acquired by a charged particle moving along a closed path $C$ in a region with zero magnetic field but non-zero vector potential $\\vec{A}$ is given by the integral:\n$$\n\\Delta\\varphi_{AB} = \\frac{e}{\\hbar} \\oint_C \\vec{A} \\cdot d\\vec{l}\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the charge of the particle and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. The integral is a holonomy, representing the phase accumulated due to the gauge connection.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the line integral of the vector potential $\\vec{A}$ along the specified path $C$. While the explicit form of $\\vec{A}$ in Cartesian coordinates can be complicated, we can find its effective form on the torus surface using the given fluxes. The problem is simplified by working with the language of differential forms. The line integral can be written as $\\oint_C A$, where $A$ is the connection 1-form. On the torus surface, which is a 2-manifold parameterized by $(\\theta, \\phi)$, any 1-form can be locally written as $A = A_\\theta d\\theta + A_\\phi d\\phi$.\n\nThe fluxes $\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}$ and $\\Phi_{\\text{pol}}$ are related to the line integrals of $\\vec{A}$ over the fundamental cycles of the torus.\n1.  The poloidal flux $\\Phi_{\\text{pol}}$ is the flux through the tube of the torus. By Stokes' theorem, this is equal to the line integral of $\\vec{A}$ along a poloidal loop $C_p$, which is a path of constant toroidal angle $\\phi$ where $\\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n    $$\n    \\Phi_{\\text{pol}} = \\oint_{C_p} \\vec{A} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\oint_{C_p} A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} A_\\theta d\\theta\n    $$\n2.  The toroidal flux $\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}$ is the flux through the hole of the torus. This is equal to the line integral of $\\vec{A}$ along a toroidal loop $C_t$, which is a path of constant poloidal angle $\\theta$ where $\\phi$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\n    $$\n    \\Phi_{\\text{tor}} = \\oint_{C_t} \\vec{A} \\cdot d\\vec{l} = \\oint_{C_t} A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} A_\\phi d\\phi\n    $$\n\nSince the magnetic field is zero on the surface, the 2-form of field strength $F=dA$ is zero. This implies that the connection 1-form $A$ is closed ($dA=0$) on the manifold. For a closed form, the coefficients $A_\\theta$ and $A_\\phi$ can be chosen to be constant throughout the surface of the torus. From the flux equations, we can deduce these constant coefficients:\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\text{pol}} = A_\\theta \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = 2\\pi A_\\theta \\implies A_\\theta = \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{pol}}}{2\\pi}\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\text{tor}} = A_\\phi \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi = 2\\pi A_\\phi \\implies A_\\phi = \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThus, the vector potential 1-form on the torus surface can be written as:\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{pol}}}{2\\pi} d\\theta + \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}}{2\\pi} d\\phi\n$$\n\nNow we must evaluate the line integral along the path of the $(p,q)$-torus knot, $C$. A $(p,q)$-torus knot can be parameterized by a single variable $\\tau \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The path winds $p$ times toroidally and $q$ times poloidally, which corresponds to the following relations for the angles:\n$$\n\\phi(\\tau) = p\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\theta(\\tau) = q\\tau\n$$\nAs $\\tau$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$, $\\phi$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi p$ and $\\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi q$, correctly describing the winding properties of the knot. The differentials are $d\\phi = p d\\tau$ and $d\\theta = q d\\tau$.\n\nWe can now compute the line integral:\n$$\n\\oint_C A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{pol}}}{2\\pi} d\\theta + \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}}{2\\pi} d\\phi \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the differentials in terms of $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\oint_C A = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{pol}}}{2\\pi} (q \\, d\\tau) + \\frac{\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}}{2\\pi} (p \\, d\\tau) \\right)\n$$\nWe can factor out the constant terms and $d\\tau$ from the integral:\n$$\n\\oint_C A = \\left(\\frac{q\\Phi_{\\text{pol}} + p\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}}{2\\pi}\\right) \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\tau\n$$\nEvaluating the simple integral over $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\oint_C A = \\left(\\frac{q\\Phi_{\\text{pol}} + p\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}}{2\\pi}\\right) [ \\tau ]_0^{2\\pi} = \\left(\\frac{q\\Phi_{\\text{pol}} + p\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}}{2\\pi}\\right) (2\\pi) = q\\Phi_{\\text{pol}} + p\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into the formula for the Aharonov-Bohm phase:\n$$\n\\Delta\\varphi_{AB} = \\frac{e}{\\hbar} \\oint_C A = \\frac{e}{\\hbar} (q\\Phi_{\\text{pol}} + p\\Phi_{\\text{tor}})\n$$\nThis result is independent of the torus radii $R$ and $r$, highlighting the topological nature of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The phase depends only on the total flux enclosed by the path, which is determined by the winding numbers $(p,q)$ of the knot and the elementary fluxes $(\\Phi_{\\text{tor}}, \\Phi_{\\text{pol}})$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{e}{\\hbar} (p\\Phi_{\\text{tor}} + q\\Phi_{\\text{pol}})} $$", "id": "87475"}, {"introduction": "Geometric phases can be generalized from simple phase factors, which are elements of $U(1)$, to matrices in groups like $SU(2)$ when the quantum system possesses internal, non-Abelian degrees of freedom.
