The left eigenvector $L$ is also found to be $L=\\mathbb{I}$. The state is not normalized as $\\lambda_{\\max} \\neq 1$. After normalization, the dominant eigenvectors represent the reduced density matrices of the semi-infinite halves of the chain.\nThe dominant right eigenvector is $R = \\mathbb{I}$.
