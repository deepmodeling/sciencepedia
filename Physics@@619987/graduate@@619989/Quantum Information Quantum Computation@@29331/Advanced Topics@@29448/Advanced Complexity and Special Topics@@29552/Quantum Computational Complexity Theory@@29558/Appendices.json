The corresponding Hilbert space is $\\mathcal{H} = (\\mathbb{C}^2)^{\\otimes 4}$. The standard Pauli matrices are denoted by $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z$. We define operators on this Hilbert space as tensor products of Pauli matrices and the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix $I$. For instance, $X_i$ denotes the operator $\\sigma_x$ acting on qubit $i$ and identity on all other qubits. Similarly, $Y_i$ and $Z_i$ represent the action of $\\sigma_y$ and $\\sigma_z$ on qubit $i$.\n\nThe system is described by a 3-local Hamiltonian $H$ which is a sum of three terms, $H = H_1 + H_2 + H_3$, where:\n$$H_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(I - Z_1 Z_2 Z_3)$$\n$$H_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(I - Z_2 Z_3 Z_4)$$\n$$H_3 = \\frac{1}{2}(I - X_1 X_2 X_4)$$\nIn this notation, the tensor product symbol $\\otimes$ is implied, e.g., $Z_1 Z_2 Z_3$ is shorthand for $Z_1 \\otimes Z_2 \\otimes Z_3 \\otimes I_4$.\n\nCalculate the ground state energy $E_0$ of the Hamiltonian $H$.", "solution": "The ground state energy $E_0$ is the minimum eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian $H = H_1 + H_2 + H_3$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of the individual terms $H_i$. Each term is of the form $H_i = \\frac{1}{2}(I - K_i)$, where\n$K_1 = Z_1 \\otimes Z_2 \\otimes Z_3 \\otimes I_4$\n$K_2 = I_1 \\otimes Z_2 \\otimes Z_3 \\otimes Z_4$\n$K_3 = X_1 \\otimes X_2 \\otimes I_3 \\otimes X_4$\n\nThe operators $K_i$ are tensor products of Pauli matrices, which are Hermitian and unitary. Therefore, each $K_i$ is also Hermitian ($K_i^\\dagger = K_i$) and unitary ($K_i^\\dagger K_i = I$). Being unitary implies $K_i^2 = I$.\nSince $K_i$ is Hermitian, its eigenvalues are real. Since $K_i^2 = I$, its eigenvalues $\\lambda$ must satisfy $\\lambda^2=1$, so the eigenvalues of each $K_i$ are $\\pm 1$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of each term $H_i = \\frac{1}{2}(I - K_i)$ are given by $\\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $K_i$. Thus, the eigenvalues of each $H_i$ are $\\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0$ and $\\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1$.\nThis shows that each $H_i$ is a projection operator. As projectors, their eigenvalues are non-negative, so they are positive semidefinite operators. The Hamiltonian $H$, being a sum of positive semidefinite operators, is also positive semidefinite. This means its eigenvalues are all non-negative, so the ground state energy $E_0 \\ge 0$.\n\nTo find the precise ground state energy, we check if the terms $H_i$ commute. The commutation of $H_i$ and $H_j$ is determined by the commutation of $K_i$ and $K_j$:\n$[H_i, H_j] = \\frac{1}{4}[I - K_i, I - K_j] = \\frac{1}{4}([K_j, K_i])$.\nSo, $[H_i, H_j]=0$ if and only if $[K_i, K_j]=0$.\n\nWe use the property that two tensor products of Pauli matrices, $P_A$ and $P_B$, commute if they anti-commute on an even number of qubits. Let's check the pairs:\n1.  $[K_1, K_2] = [Z_1 Z_2 Z_3, Z_2 Z_3 Z_4]$. The operators act non-trivially on overlapping sets of qubits {2, 3}. On qubit 2, we have $(Z_2, Z_2)$, which commute. On qubit 3, we have $(Z_3, Z_3)$, which commute. Thus, $[K_1, K_2] = 0$.\n\n2.  $[K_1, K_3] = [Z_1 Z_2 Z_3, X_1 X_2 X_4]$. The operators overlap on qubits {1, 2}.\n    - Qubit 1: $(Z_1, X_1)$. They anti-commute: $Z_1 X_1 = -X_1 Z_1$.\n    - Qubit 2: $(Z_2, X_2)$. They anti-commute: $Z_2 X_2 = -X_2 Z_2$.\n    Since they anti-commute on two qubits (an even number), the overall operators commute: $K_1 K_3 = (-1)^2 K_3 K_1 = K_3 K_1$. So, $[K_1, K_3] = 0$.\n\n3.  $[K_2, K_3] = [Z_2 Z_3 Z_4, X_1 X_2 X_4]$. The operators overlap on qubits {2, 4}.\n    - Qubit 2: $(Z_2, X_2)$. They anti-commute.\n    - Qubit 4: $(Z_4, X_4)$. They anti-commute.\n    Again, they anti-commute on two qubits, so the operators commute: $[K_2, K_3]=0$.\n\nSince all $K_i$ commute with each other, all $H_i$ commute with each other. This means they are simultaneously diagonalizable. There exists a basis of common eigenvectors for $H_1, H_2, H_3$.\nLet $|\\psi\\rangle$ be such a common eigenvector. Then $H_i |\\psi\\rangle = \\epsilon_i |\\psi\\rangle$, where $\\epsilon_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe action of the total Hamiltonian on this state is:\n$$H |\\psi\\rangle = (H_1 + H_2 + H_3) |\\psi\\rangle = (\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_3) |\\psi\\rangle$$\nThe eigenvalues of $H$ are sums of the form $\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_3$. The ground state energy $E_0$ is the minimum possible value of this sum. Since $\\epsilon_i \\ge 0$, the minimum possible value is 0.\n\nThis minimum value $E_0 = 0$ is achieved if there exists a state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ such that $\\epsilon_1=\\epsilon_2=\\epsilon_3=0$ for this state. This requires the existence of a common eigenvector $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ such that:\n$$H_i |\\psi_0\\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i=1, 2, 3$$\nThis is equivalent to the condition:\n$$K_i |\\psi_0\\rangle = |\\psi_0\\rangle \\quad \\text{for } i=1, 2, 3$$\nThis means we are looking for a state that is a simultaneous eigenstate of $K_1, K_2, K_3$ with eigenvalue +1 for all of them.\n\nIn the language of stabilizer theory, the commuting operators $K_1, K_2, K_3$ generate an abelian group $S = \\langle K_1, K_2, K_3 \\rangle$. A simultaneous +1 eigenstate exists if and only if $-I$ is not an element of this group.\nThe elements of the group are products of the generators, such as $K_1 K_2$, $K_1 K_3$, $K_2 K_3$, etc. All generators are tensor products of Hermitian Pauli matrices ($I,X,Y,Z$) with real coefficients. Their products are also such operators. For any such operator to be equal to $-I$, it must be a scalar multiple of the identity. The only such operators that are tensor products of Paulis are $\\pm I$ (and $\\pm iI$, etc., but here coefficients are real). Let's check if any non-trivial product of generators gives $I$ (to check for independence) or $-I$.\n$K_1 K_2 = (Z_1 Z_2 Z_3)(Z_2 Z_3 Z_4) = Z_1 Z_2^2 Z_3^2 Z_4 = Z_1 Z_4$. This is not $I$.\nThe generators $K_1, K_2, K_3$ are independent operators, as no one can be formed from the others (e.g., $K_3$ contains $X$ while $K_1, K_2$ do not, and $K_1 K_2=Z_1 Z_4$ is not proportional to $K_3$).\nNo product of these generators results in $-I$. For instance, all operators $K_i$ are real matrices, so their products are real. Thus, we only need to check if any product equals $-I$. None do.\n\nTherefore, a non-zero \"+1 eigenspace\" common to all $K_i$ must exist. The dimension of this ground state subspace is $2^{n-k}$, where $n=4$ qubits and $k=3$ is the number of independent generators. The dimension is $2^{4-3} = 2$.\nSo, there is a 2-dimensional space of states $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ satisfying $K_i |\\psi_0\\rangle = |\\psi_0\\rangle$ for all $i$. For any state in this subspace, $H_i |\\psi_0\\rangle = 0$ for all $i$.\n\nFor such a ground state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$, the energy is:\n$$E_0 = \\langle \\psi_0 | H | \\psi_0 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_0 | (H_1 + H_2 + H_3) | \\psi_0 \\rangle = \\langle \\psi_0 | 0 | \\psi_0 \\rangle + \\langle \\psi_0 | 0 | \\psi_0 \\rangle + \\langle \\psi_0 | 0 | \\psi_0 \\rangle = 0$$\nThe existence of such a state proves that the ground state energy is 0.
