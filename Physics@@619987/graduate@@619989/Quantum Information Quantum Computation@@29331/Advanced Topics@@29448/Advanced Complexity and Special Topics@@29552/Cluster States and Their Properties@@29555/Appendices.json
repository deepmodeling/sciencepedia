A simple yet fundamental MBQC protocol is the \"quantum wire,\" which transmits a quantum state from one end of a linear cluster state to the other.\n\nConsider a 3-qubit linear cluster state, $|\\psi_C\\rangle$. It is prepared by initializing three qubits in the state $|+\\rangle^{\\otimes 3}$, where $|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$, and then applying a controlled-Z (CZ) gate between qubit 1 and 2, and another between qubit 2 and 3. The corresponding unitary is $U_C = CZ_{23} CZ_{12}$. Thus, $|\\psi_C\\rangle = U_C |+\\rangle^{\\otimes 3}$.\n\nThe standard quantum wire protocol on this state involves sequential measurements: first, qubit 1 is measured in the $X$-basis (eigenstates $|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle$), and then qubit 2 is also measured in the $X$-basis. This sequence ideally teleports the logical information from the start of the wire to the end (qubit 3).\n\nSuppose that just before the computation begins, a single Pauli-X error occurs on the second qubit. The initial state for the computation is therefore not the ideal cluster state $|\\psi_C\\rangle$, but the erroneous state $|\\psi_E\\rangle = X_2 |\\psi_C\\rangle$.\n\nThe measurement protocol (measuring qubits 1 and 2 in the $X$-basis) is then executed on this erroneous state $|\\psi_E\\rangle$. After these measurements are performed, what is the total probability of finding the final qubit (qubit 3) in the state $|+\\rangle_3$? The result should be independent of the specific measurement outcomes for qubits 1 and 2.", "solution": "This problem can be solved by analyzing how the Pauli-$X$ error on qubit 2 affects the final state of qubit 3 after the measurement sequence.\n\n1.  **Error-Free Protocol:** In the standard 3-qubit quantum wire protocol, the logical information encoded in the first qubit (initialized to $|+\\rangle_1$) is teleported to the third qubit. The state of qubit 3, before any final correction, depends on the random binary outcomes of the $X$-basis measurements on qubits 1 and 2. Let these outcomes be $m_1, m_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where a measurement of $|+\\rangle$ corresponds to 0 and $|-\\rangle$ corresponds to 1. The final state on qubit 3 is:\n    $$|\\psi_3(m_1, m_2)\\rangle = X_3^{m_1} Z_3^{m_2} |+\\rangle_3$$\n\n2.  **Effect of the Pauli-$X$ Error:** The computation starts with the state $|\\psi_E\\rangle = X_2 |\\psi_C\\rangle$. In the framework of MBQC, a Pauli-$X$ error on a qubit that is scheduled to be measured in the $X$-basis is a benign error. It does not corrupt the logical information being processed. Its only effect is to flip the classical measurement outcome for that qubit. The measurement of $X_1$ is unaffected. The measurement of $X_2$ will yield an outcome $m_2'$ that is flipped relative to the error-free outcome $m_2$. That is, $m_2' = m_2 \\oplus 1$.\n\n3.  **Final State in the Errored Protocol:** The state on qubit 3 is determined by the measurement outcomes. Since $m_1$ is unaffected and $m_2$ is flipped, the final state is:\n    $$|\\psi_{3,E}(m_1, m_2)\\rangle = X_3^{m_1} Z_3^{m_2 \\oplus 1} |+\\rangle_3$$\n    where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the random outcomes that *would have* occurred in the error-free case.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** We need to find the probability of measuring qubit 3 in the state $|+\\rangle_3$, averaged over the four equally likely combinations of the underlying random outcomes $m_1, m_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The probability for a given state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is $|\\langle + | \\psi \\rangle|^2$.\n\n    Let's compute the inner product:\n    $$ \\langle + | X_3^{m_1} Z_3^{m_2 \\oplus 1} |+\\rangle $$\n    Since $\\langle+|X|+\\rangle = \\langle+|$, the $X_3^{m_1}$ operator does not affect the magnitude of the inner product. We can focus on the $Z$ operator:\n    $$ \\langle + | Z_3^{m_2 \\oplus 1} |+\\rangle $$\n    - If $m_2 \\oplus 1 = 0$ (i.e., $m_2 = 1$), the operator is $I_3$, and the inner product is $\\langle+|+\\rangle = 1$.\n    - If $m_2 \\oplus 1 = 1$ (i.e., $m_2 = 0$), the operator is $Z_3$, and the inner product is $\\langle+|Z_3|+\\rangle = \\langle+|-\\rangle = 0$.\n\n    The probability of measuring $|+\\rangle_3$ is 1 if the underlying random outcome $m_2=1$, and 0 if $m_2=0$.\n\n5.  **Average Over Outcomes:** Since the underlying measurement outcome $m_2$ is 0 or 1 with equal probability (1/2), the total average probability is:\n    $$ P(+) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times P(+, \\text{given } m_2=0)\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times P(+, \\text{given } m_2=1)\\right) $$\n    $$ P(+) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 0\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\n    The total probability of finding the final qubit in the state $|+\\rangle_3$ is $1/2$.
