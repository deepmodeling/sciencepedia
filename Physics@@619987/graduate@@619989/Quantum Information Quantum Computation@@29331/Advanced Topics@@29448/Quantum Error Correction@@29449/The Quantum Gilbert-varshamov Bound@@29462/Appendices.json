The code has a distance $d$, which means it can correct any error affecting up to $t = \\lfloor (d-1)/2 \\rfloor$ qubits. Such errors are modeled as tensor products of Pauli matrices $\\{I, X, Y, Z\\}$. The weight of an error is the number of non-identity Pauli operators in the tensor product.\n\nThe existence of \"good\" quantum codes, i.e., codes with a high rate $k/n$ and large distance $d$, can be explored through various bounds. The quantum Gilbert-Varshamov (QGV) bound provides a sufficient condition for the existence of stabilizer codes. It states that an $[[n, k, d]]$ stabilizer quantum code exists if the following inequality holds:\n$$ 2^{n-k} > \\sum_{j=0}^{t} \\binom{n}{j} 3^j $$\nThis condition arises from a sphere-packing argument: if the number of distinguishable syndromes ($2^{n-k}$) is greater than the number of correctable errors (the sum on the right), a code can be constructed.\n\nConsider a system with $n=25$ physical qubits.
