Let's break down the solution into several steps.\n\n**1. Initial State and Stabilizers**\n\nThe initial state is $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = |+_L\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|0_L\\rangle + |1_L\\rangle\\right)$. The stabilizer generators are $S_1 = X_1 X_2$ and $S_2 = X_2 X_3$. A state is in the code space if it is a $+1$ eigenstate of all stabilizers. Let's verify this for the basis states.

This means the initial state lies in the syndrome subspace $(s_1, s_2) = (+1, +1)$.\n\n**2. Target Syndrome Identification**\n\nWe need to find the syndrome corresponding to a $Z_2$ error. Let's apply $Z_2$ to a generic code state $|\\psi_L\\rangle$. We check how the stabilizers act on the errored state $Z_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle$. We use the anti-commutation relation $\\{X_i, Z_i\\} = X_i Z_i + Z_i X_i = 0$ and the commutation relation $[X_i, Z_j] = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nFor $S_1$:\n$$ S_1 (Z_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle) = (X_1 X_2) Z_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle = X_1 (X_2 Z_2) |\\psi_L\\rangle = X_1 (-Z_2 X_2) |\\psi_L\\rangle = -Z_2 (X_1 X_2) |\\psi_L\\rangle = -Z_2 S_1 |\\psi_L\\rangle $$\nSince $S_1 |\\psi_L\\rangle = (+1) |\\psi_L\\rangle$, we have $S_1 (Z_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle) = -Z_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle$. So the measured eigenvalue for $S_1$ is $s_1 = -1$.\n\nFor $S_2$:\n$$ S_2 (Z_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle) = (X_2 X_3) Z_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle = (X_2 Z_2) X_3 |\\psi_L\\rangle = (-Z_2 X_2) X_3 |\\psi_L\\rangle = -Z_2 (X_2 X_3) |\\psi_L\\rangle = -Z_2 S_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle $$\nSince $S_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle = (+1) |\\psi_L\\rangle$, we have $S_2 (Z_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle) = -Z_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle$. So the measured eigenvalue for $S_2$ is $s_2 = -1$.\n\nThe syndrome for a $Z_2$ error is therefore $(-1,-1)$. We need to calculate the probability of measuring this syndrome.\n\n**3. State After the Error**\n\nThe error is an $R_y(\\theta)$ rotation on the second qubit. The error operator is $E = I_1 \\otimes R_y(\\theta)_2 \\otimes I_3$. We can decompose $R_y(\\theta)_2$ using Euler's formula for operators:\n$$ R_y(\\theta)_2 = \\exp(-i\\frac{\\theta}{2}Y_2) = \\cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2})I_2 - i\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2})Y_2 $$\nThe state after the error is:\n$$ |\\psi_{err}\\rangle = E |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = \\left(\\cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2})I_2 - i\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2})Y_2\\right) |\\psi_{in}\\rangle $$\n$$ |\\psi_{err}\\rangle = \\cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2})|\\psi_{in}\\rangle - i\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle $$\nThis shows the final state is a superposition of the original state and a state resulting from a $Y_2$ error.\n\n**4. Probability Calculation**\n\nThe probability of measuring the syndrome $(s_1, s_2) = (-1, -1)$ is given by the squared norm of the projection of $|\\psi_{err}\\rangle$ onto the corresponding subspace. Let $P_{(-1,-1)}$ be this projector.\n$$ p(-1,-1) = \\| P_{(-1,-1)} |\\psi_{err}\\rangle \\|^2 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $|\\psi_{err}\\rangle$:\n$$ p(-1,-1) = \\| P_{(-1,-1)} \\left(\\cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2})|\\psi_{in}\\rangle - i\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle\\right) \\|^2 $$\nThe syndrome subspaces are orthogonal. Since $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle$ is in the $(+1,+1)$ subspace, its projection onto the $(-1,-1)$ subspace is zero: $P_{(-1,-1)} |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ p(-1,-1) = \\| -i\\sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) P_{(-1,-1)} (Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle) \\|^2 = \\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\| P_{(-1,-1)} (Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle) \\|^2 $$\nNow we must determine the syndrome of the state $Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle$. We check its eigenvalues under $S_1$ and $S_2$, using the anti-commutation relation $\\{X_i, Y_i\\}=0$ and commutation relation $[X_i, Y_j]=0$ for $i\\neq j$.\n\nFor $S_1$:\n$$ S_1 (Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle) = (X_1 X_2) Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = X_1 (X_2 Y_2) |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = X_1 (-Y_2 X_2) |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = -Y_2 (X_1 X_2) |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = -Y_2 S_1 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle $$\nSince $S_1 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = |\\psi_{in}\\rangle$, we have $S_1 (Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle) = - Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle$. The state $Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle$ is a $-1$ eigenstate of $S_1$.\n\nFor $S_2$:\n$$ S_2 (Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle) = (X_2 X_3) Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = (X_2 Y_2) X_3 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = (-Y_2 X_2) X_3 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = -Y_2 (X_2 X_3) |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = -Y_2 S_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle $$\nSince $S_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = |\\psi_{in}\\rangle$, we have $S_2 (Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle) = - Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle$. The state $Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle$ is a $-1$ eigenstate of $S_2$.\n\nThis means the state $Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle$ lies entirely within the $(-1,-1)$ syndrome subspace. Therefore, the projection operator $P_{(-1,-1)}$ acts as the identity on it:\n$$ P_{(-1,-1)} (Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle) = Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle $$\nThe probability calculation becomes:\n$$ p(-1,-1) = \\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) \\| Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle \\|^2 $$\nSince $Y_2$ is a unitary operator, it preserves the norm of the state:\n$$ \\| Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle \\|^2 = \\langle\\psi_{in}| Y_2^\\dagger Y_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = \\langle\\psi_{in}| I_2 |\\psi_{in}\\rangle = \\langle\\psi_{in}|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = 1 $$\nFinally, we obtain the probability:\n$$ p(-1,-1) = \\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2}) $$\nThe probability of measuring the syndrome corresponding to a $Z_2$ error is $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)} $$", "id": "177477"}, {"introduction": "We now assemble all the pieces to analyze the full error correction pipeline and its consequences for logical information.

This procedure consists of measuring the six stabilizer generators and, based on the resulting syndrome, applying the corresponding corrective operation. For the Steane code, the X- and Z-type errors are corrected independently. An X-type error (a product of Pauli-X and/or Pauli-Y operators) is detected by the Z-type stabilizers, and the resulting syndrome is corrected by applying the single-qubit Pauli-X operator that produces the same syndrome.

The measurement projects the state $|\\psi_e\\rangle$ onto subspaces corresponding to different syndromes. Let's analyze the syndrome of the error term $E = X_1 X_2$.\n\nThe Steane code is a CSS code, so X-type errors and Z-type errors are detected by different sets of stabilizers.\n1.  **Z-error detection:** Z-type errors (involving $Z$ or $Y$ Paulis) are detected by the X-type stabilizers ($g_1, g_2, g_3$). Our error operator $E=X_1 X_2$ is a pure X-type error. It commutes with all X-type stabilizers: $[X_1 X_2, g_i] = 0$ for $i=1,2,3$. Therefore, the X-syndrome is trivial, $(0,0,0)$. This means no Z-correction is applied.\n\n2.  **X-error detection:** X-type errors (involving $X$ or $Y$ Paulis) are detected by the Z-type stabilizers ($g_4, g_5, g_6$). We check for commutation or anti-commutation of $E = X_1 X_2$ with these generators.\n    -   $[E, g_4] = [X_1 X_2, Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7]$. $X_1$ anti-commutes with $Z_1$. $X_2$ commutes with all Paulis in $g_4$. Thus, $\\{E, g_4\\}=0$. The syndrome bit is 1.\n    -   $[E, g_5] = [X_1 X_2, Z_2 Z_3 Z_6 Z_7]$. $X_2$ anti-commutes with $Z_2$. $X_1$ commutes with all Paulis in $g_5$. Thus, $\\{E, g_5\\}=0$. The syndrome bit is 1.\n    -   $[E, g_6] = [X_1 X_2, Z_4 Z_5 Z_6 Z_7]$. The operators act on disjoint sets of qubits, so they commute. $[E, g_6]=0$. The syndrome bit is 0.\n\nThe Z-syndrome vector (corresponding to stabilizers $g_4, g_5, g_6$) is therefore $(1,1,0)$. The standard correction algorithm assumes a single-qubit error occurred. We must find which single-qubit X-error gives this syndrome.\n-   $X_1$: anti-commutes with $g_4$. Syndrome $(1,0,0)$.\n-   $X_2$: anti-commutes with $g_5$. Syndrome $(0,1,0)$.\n-   $X_3$: anti-commutes with $g_4$ and $g_5$. Syndrome $(1,1,0)$.\n-   ...and so on for other qubits.\n\nThe syndrome $(1,1,0)$ matches that of a single-qubit error $X_3$. Thus, the recovery operation applied by the correction procedure is $R = X_3$.\n\nNow we analyze the overall process. The syndrome measurement projects the state.\n-   The component of $|\\psi_e\\rangle$ with a trivial syndrome is $\\cos(\\epsilon)|\\psi_L\\rangle$. The probability of measuring the trivial syndrome is $\\|\\cos(\\epsilon)|\\psi_L\\rangle\\|^2 = \\cos^2(\\epsilon)$. In this case, no correction is applied, and the system is left in the state $|\\psi_L\\rangle$.\n-   The component of $|\\psi_e\\rangle$ with a non-trivial syndrome is $-i\\sin(\\epsilon) X_1 X_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle$. The probability of measuring the syndrome $(1,1,0)$ is $\\|-i\\sin(\\epsilon) X_1 X_2|\\psi_L\\rangle\\|^2 = \\sin^2(\\epsilon)$. In this case, the state collapses to $\\frac{-i\\sin(\\epsilon) X_1 X_2|\\psi_L\\rangle}{\\sin(\\epsilon)} = -i X_1 X_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle$. The recovery operator $R=X_3$ is then applied, resulting in the state $X_3(-i X_1 X_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle) = -i X_3 X_1 X_2 |\\psi_L\\rangle$.\n\nThe net effect of the misidentified error is the operator $X_3 X_1 X_2$ applied to the state. We must check if this is a logical operator. $X_3 X_1 X_2 = X_1 X_2 X_3$. Let's compare this to the logical operator $X_L = X_1 X_2 X_3 X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7$.\n$$\n(X_1 X_2 X_3) \\cdot (X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7) = X_L\n$$\nThe operator $g_3 = X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7$ is a stabilizer.
