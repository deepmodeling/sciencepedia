The dimension of a linear code and its dual are related by the fundamental formula:\n$$K + k^\\perp = N$$\nwhere $N$ is the length of the code $C$ and $K$ is its dimension. Our strategy is to first determine the parameters $N$ and $K$ for the constructed code $C$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the length $N$ of the code $C$.**\n\nThe code $C$ is constructed using the $(u|u+v)$ method, where $u \\in C_1$ and $v \\in C_2$. The codes $C_1$ and $C_2$ both have length $n=7$. A codeword in $C$ is formed by concatenating a vector of length $n$ with another vector of length $n$. Therefore, the length of any codeword in $C$ is:\n$$N = n + n = 7 + 7 = 14$$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the dimension $K$ of the code $C$.**\n\nThe dimension $K$ of a binary code is related to the number of codewords, $|C|$, by $|C| = 2^K$. The set of codewords in $C$ is given by $C = \\{ (u | u+v) \\mid u \\in C_1, v \\in C_2 \\}$.

This is a linear map because for any $u, u' \\in C_1$, $v, v' \\in C_2$ and scalars $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{F}_2$:\n$$\\phi(\\alpha u + \\beta u', \\alpha v + \\beta v') = (\\alpha u + \\beta u' | (\\alpha u + \\beta u') + (\\alpha v + \\beta v'))$$\n$$= (\\alpha u + \\beta u' | \\alpha(u+v) + \\beta(u'+v'))$$\n$$= \\alpha(u | u+v) + \\beta(u' | u'+v') = \\alpha\\phi(u,v) + \\beta\\phi(u',v')$$\nThe image of this map is the code $C$. By the rank-nullity theorem for linear maps, the dimension of the image (which is $K$) is the dimension of the domain minus the dimension of the kernel.\n\nThe domain is the Cartesian product $C_1 \\times C_2$. Its dimension is $\\dim(C_1) + \\dim(C_2) = k_1 + k_2$.\nThe kernel of $\\phi$ consists of pairs $(u, v)$ such that $\\phi(u, v) = (0|0)$, where the first $0$ is the zero vector of length $n$ and the second is also the zero vector of length $n$.\n$$(u|u+v) = (0|0) \\implies u=0 \\text{ and } u+v=0$$\nSubstituting $u=0$ into the second equation gives $0+v=0$, which implies $v=0$.\nThus, the only element in the kernel is $(0,0)$. The kernel is trivial, so its dimension is $0$.\n\nThis means the map $\\phi$ is injective (one-to-one), and the number of codewords in $C$ is equal to the number of pairs $(u,v)$.\n$$|C| = |C_1| \\times |C_2|$$\nThe number of codewords in $C_1$ is $2^{k_1}$ and in $C_2$ is $2^{k_2}$.\n$$|C| = 2^{k_1} \\times 2^{k_2} = 2^{k_1+k_2}$$\nSince $|C| = 2^K$, the dimension of the code $C$ is:\n$$K = k_1 + k_2$$\n\n**Step 3: Substitute the given parameters.**\n\nThe parameters for the codes $C_1$ and $C_2$ are given:\n- For $C_1$, a $[7,1,7]$ code, the dimension is $k_1 = 1$.\n- For $C_2$, a $[7,4,3]$ code, the dimension is $k_2 = 4$.\n\nSubstituting these values, we find the dimension of $C$:\n$$K = 1 + 4 = 5$$\nSo, the constructed code $C$ is a $[14, 5]$ linear code.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the dimension $k^\\perp$ of the dual code $C^\\perp$.**\n\nUsing the relation $K + k^\\perp = N$, we can now solve for $k^\\perp$:\n$$5 + k^\\perp = 14$$\n$$k^\\perp = 14 - 5 = 9$$\n\nThe dimension of the dual code $C^\\perp$ is 9.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "54036"}, {"introduction": "Beyond dimension, the complete weight distribution of a code offers a much richer description of its structure, elegantly captured by the weight enumerator polynomial.
