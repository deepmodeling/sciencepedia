By working through the separate syndrome measurement and recovery stages for the $X$ and $Z$ components of the error, you will see firsthand how this modular design allows for perfect correction of errors that extend beyond single-qubit Pauli operators.", "problem": "The Steane code is a `[[7,1,3]]` quantum error-correcting code that encodes one logical qubit into seven physical qubits. It is a type of CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) code built upon the classical `[7,4,3]` Hamming code.\n\nThe stabilizer generators for the Steane code can be defined using the parity-check matrix $H$ of the classical Hamming code. Let the rows of $H$ be $h_1, h_2, h_3$. In a standard representation, these are:\n$h_1 = (0,0,0,1,1,1,1)$\n$h_2 = (0,1,1,0,0,1,1)$\n$h_3 = (1,0,1,0,1,0,1)$\n\nThe stabilizer generators are then given by applying Pauli $X$ or $Z$ operators to the qubits specified by the 1s in each row vector $h_i$. Let $X(v) = \\bigotimes_{i=1}^7 X_i^{v_i}$ and $Z(v) = \\bigotimes_{i=1}^7 Z_i^{v_i}$ for a binary vector $v=(v_1, \\dots, v_7)$. The six generators are:\n- $g_1 = X(h_1) = X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7$\n- $g_2 = X(h_2) = X_2 X_3 X_6 X_7$\n- $g_3 = X(h_3) = X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7$\n- $g_4 = Z(h_1) = Z_4 Z_5 Z_6 Z_7$\n- $g_5 = Z(h_2) = Z_2 Z_3 Z_6 Z_7$\n- $g_6 = Z(h_3) = Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7$\n\nThe logical Pauli operators for this code are $X_L = \\bigotimes_{i=1}^7 X_i$ and $Z_L = \\bigotimes_{i=1}^7 Z_i$. The logical basis states can be written as $|0\\rangle_L$ and $|1\\rangle_L = X_L|0\\rangle_L$.\n\nThe standard error correction procedure for the Steane code involves two separate syndrome measurements:\n1.  **Bit-flip (X-error) correction:** The eigenvalues of the Z-type generators ($g_4, g_5, g_6$) are measured. The resulting 3-bit syndrome $(s_6, s_5, s_4)$ (where $g_{i+3}|\\psi\\rangle_{err} = (-1)^{s_{i+3}} |\\psi\\rangle_{err}$) is matched to the unique single-qubit $X_j$ error that would cause it. A corresponding $X_j$ is applied as a recovery operation.\n2.  **Phase-flip (Z-error) correction:** The eigenvalues of the X-type generators ($g_1, g_2, g_3$) are measured. The syndrome $(s_3, s_2, s_1)$ is matched to the unique single-qubit $Z_j$ error, and a corrective $Z_j$ is applied.\n\nConsider a logical qubit prepared in the initial state $|\\psi_{\\text{init}}\\rangle = |+\\rangle_L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_L + |1\\rangle_L)$. A correlated error $E = X_1 Z_4$ occurs on the physical qubits. After the error, the standard recovery procedure described above is applied.\n\nCalculate the fidelity $F = |\\langle\\psi_{\\text{init}}|\\psi_{\\text{final}}\\rangle|^2$ between the initial state and the state $|\\psi_{\\text{final}}\\rangle$ after the recovery procedure is complete.", "solution": "The initial state is $|\\psi_{\\text{init}}\\rangle = |+\\rangle_L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle_L + |1\\rangle_L)$. The error $E = X_1 Z_4$ occurs, resulting in the state:\n\n$$\n|\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle = E |\\psi_{\\text{init}}\\rangle = X_1 Z_4 |+\\rangle_L.\n$$\n\n\nThe recovery procedure for the Steane code involves two steps: first, correcting bit-flip (X) errors using the Z-type stabilizers, and then correcting phase-flip (Z) errors using the X-type stabilizers.\n\n**Step 1: Bit-flip (X-error) correction.**\nThe Z-type stabilizers are:\n- $g_4 = Z(h_1) = Z_4 Z_5 Z_6 Z_7$\n- $g_5 = Z(h_2) = Z_2 Z_3 Z_6 Z_7$\n- $g_6 = Z(h_3) = Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7$\n\nThe syndrome $(s_6, s_5, s_4)$ is determined by the commutation of the error with each stabilizer. The error $E = X_1 Z_4$ has an X-error component $X_1$. Since $Z_4$ commutes with all Z-type stabilizers, only $X_1$ affects the syndrome:\n- $X_1$ commutes with $g_4$ (disjoint support), so $s_4 = 0$.\n- $X_1$ commutes with $g_5$ (disjoint support), so $s_5 = 0$.\n- $X_1$ anticommutes with $g_6$ (both act on qubit 1), so $s_6 = 1$.\n\nThus, the syndrome is $(s_6, s_5, s_4) = (1, 0, 0)$. This syndrome corresponds to an X-error on qubit 1, as the parity-check matrix columns give the syndrome $(h_{3j}, h_{2j}, h_{1j})$ for qubit $j$, and for $j=1$, $(h_{31}, h_{21}, h_{11}) = (1, 0, 0)$. The recovery operation is $X_1$, so the state becomes:\n\n$$\nX_1 |\\psi_{\\text{err}}\\rangle = X_1 (X_1 Z_4 |+\\rangle_L) = (X_1 X_1) Z_4 |+\\rangle_L = I \\cdot Z_4 |+\\rangle_L = Z_4 |+\\rangle_L.\n$$\n\n\n**Step 2: Phase-flip (Z-error) correction.**\nThe X-type stabilizers are:\n- $g_1 = X(h_1) = X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7$\n- $g_2 = X(h_2) = X_2 X_3 X_6 X_7$\n- $g_3 = X(h_3) = X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7$\n\nThe syndrome $(s_3, s_2, s_1)$ is determined by the commutation of the current error $Z_4$ with each stabilizer:\n- $Z_4$ anticommutes with $g_1$ (both act on qubit 4), so $s_1 = 1$.\n- $Z_4$ commutes with $g_2$ (disjoint support), so $s_2 = 0$.\n- $Z_4$ commutes with $g_3$ (disjoint support), so $s_3 = 0$.\n\nThus, the syndrome is $(s_3, s_2, s_1) = (0, 0, 1)$. This syndrome corresponds to a Z-error on qubit 4, as the parity-check matrix columns give $(h_{3j}, h_{2j}, h_{1j})$ for qubit $j$, and for $j=4$, $(h_{34}, h_{24}, h_{14}) = (0, 0, 1)$. The recovery operation is $Z_4$, so the state becomes:\n\n$$\nZ_4 (Z_4 |+\\rangle_L) = (Z_4 Z_4) |+\\rangle_L = I \\cdot |+\\rangle_L = |+\\rangle_L.\n$$\n\n\nThe final state is identical to the initial state: $|\\psi_{\\text{final}}\\rangle = |+\\rangle_L$. The fidelity is:\n\n$$\nF = |\\langle\\psi_{\\text{init}}|\\psi_{\\text{final}}\\rangle|^2 = |\\langle+_L|+_L\\rangle|^2 = |1|^2 = 1.\n$$\n\n\nAlternatively, the combined recovery operation $R = Z_4 X_1$ and error $E = X_1 Z_4$ commute (since they act on different qubits), and:\n\n$$\nR E = Z_4 X_1 X_1 Z_4 = Z_4 (X_1^2) Z_4 = Z_4 I Z_4 = Z_4^2 = I,\n$$\n\nconfirming that the state is perfectly restored.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "133330"}, {"introduction": "While a quantum error-correcting code guarantees the correction of errors up to a certain weight, understanding its behavior beyond that limit is crucial.

It is a type of CSS code constructed from the classical `[7, 4, 3]` Hamming code. The stabilizer group of the Steane code is generated by six operators. For the purpose of this problem, we define the code using a specific set of stabilizer generators.\n\nLet the seven qubits be indexed by the integers $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$. The stabilizer generators are divided into two types, $X$-type and $Z$-type. These are constructed using the parity check matrix $H$ of the classical Hamming code, where the $j$-th column of $H$ is the 3-bit binary representation of the integer $j$.\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rows of this matrix define the supports of the stabilizer generators. The three $X$-type generators $\\{K_1^X, K_2^X, K_3^X\\}$ and three $Z$-type generators $\\{K_1^Z, K_2^Z, K_3^Z\\}$ are:\n- $K_1^X = X_4 X_5 X_6 X_7$, $K_1^Z = Z_4 Z_5 Z_6 Z_7$\n- $K_2^X = X_2 X_3 X_6 X_7$, $K_2^Z = Z_2 Z_3 Z_6 Z_7$\n- $K_3^X = X_1 X_3 X_5 X_7$, $K_3^Z = Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7$\n\nA standard error correction procedure for Pauli $X$ errors (bit flips) is as follows:\n1.  The three $Z$-type stabilizers $\\{K_1^Z, K_2^Z, K_3^Z\\}$ are measured.\n2.  The measurement outcomes yield a 3-bit error syndrome $s = (s_1, s_2, s_3)$, where $s_i=0$ if the state is an eigenvector of $K_i^Z$ with eigenvalue $+1$ and $s_i=1$ if the eigenvalue is $-1$.\n3.  This syndrome $s$ is interpreted as the binary representation of an integer $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 7\\}$.\n4.  If $k=0$, it is assumed no error occurred. If $k \\neq 0$, it is assumed a single-qubit error $X_k$ occurred, and a corrective operation $X_k$ is applied to the system.\n\nA non-trivial logical operator is an operator that commutes with all six stabilizer generators but is not an element of the stabilizer group (i.e., it cannot be written as a product of the generators). An error $E$ is said to be miscorrected into a non-trivial logical operator if the combined effect of the error and the subsequent \"correction\", $E_{\\text{corr}} E$, results in such an operator.\n\nConsidering all possible two-qubit Pauli-X errors of the form $E = X_i X_j$ (where $i \\neq j$), determine the total number of such errors that are miscorrected by the procedure described above into a non-trivial logical operator.", "solution": "1.

To understand the correction process, we first determine the error syndrome by checking which stabilizer generators anti-commute with $E$. An operator $A$ anti-commutes with $B$ if $AB = -BA$. The syndrome bit for stabilizer $S_k$ is 1 (or eigenvalue -1) if it anti-commutes with the error $E$, and 0 (or eigenvalue +1) if it commutes.\n\n- **Bit-flip stabilizers:**\n  - $S_1 = Z_1 Z_2$: Anti-commutes with $X_1$, commutes with $X_4, X_7$.
