However, when an error exceeds the code's designed correction capability, the outcome can be more subtle than a simple failure. This practice investigates the effect of a correlated two-qubit error, which a standard decoder misidentifies as a single-qubit error. By analyzing the subsequent effect on a logical zero state, we uncover a fascinating case where the code's structure prevents a logical-state flip, even though the correction process results in a non-trivial logical operator.

It is a type of CSS code, denoted as $[[7, 1, 3]]$, capable of correcting an arbitrary single-qubit error.\n\nThe code is defined by a set of stabilizer generators. The stabilizer group $\\mathcal{S}$ is generated by six operators. For the standard Steane code, these generators are derived from the classical $[7,4,3]$ Hamming code's parity check matrix $H$:\n$$\nH = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rows of $H$ define the support of the $X$-type stabilizer generators, and also the $Z$-type stabilizer generators. Let's denote the $j$-th column of $H$ as $h_j$.\nThe stabilizer generators are $\\{g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4, g_5, g_6\\}$, where\n$g_1=X_4X_5X_6X_7$, $g_2=X_2X_3X_6X_7$, $g_3=X_1X_3X_5X_7$ (X-type),\nand $g_4=Z_4Z_5Z_6Z_7$, $g_5=Z_2Z_3Z_6Z_7$, $g_6=Z_1Z_3Z_5Z_7$ (Z-type).\n\nThe logical Pauli operators are given by $\\bar{X} = \\prod_{i=1}^7 X_i$ and $\\bar{Z} = \\prod_{i=1}^7 Z_i$.\n\nThe logical zero state, $|\\bar{0}\\rangle$, is the unique state (up to a global phase) in the code space that is a $+1$ eigenstate of all stabilizer generators and also a $+1$ eigenstate of the logical $\\bar{Z}$ operator, i.e.,\n$g_i |\\bar{0}\\rangle = |\\bar{0}\\rangle$ for $i=1,\\dots,6$, and $\\bar{Z}|\\bar{0}\\rangle = |\\bar{0}\\rangle$.\n\nConsider a physical system where this encoded qubit is subject to a correlated dephasing error channel. This channel affects the first two qubits ($q_1, q_2$) of the 7-qubit block. With probability $p$, it applies the two-qubit Pauli operator $Z_1Z_2$. With probability $1-p$, it does nothing. The initial state of the system is the logical zero state, $|\\bar{0}\\rangle$.\n\nAfter the channel acts, a standard error correction procedure is performed. This procedure involves:\n1.  Measuring the six stabilizer generators to obtain an error syndrome. For a $Z$-type error $E_Z$, the syndrome is determined by which $X$-type generators anticommute with $E_Z$.\n2.  Applying a recovery operation based on the syndrome. The recovery operation is chosen to be the Pauli operator corresponding to the minimum weight error that could have caused the observed syndrome.\n\nA logical error occurs if the final state after the error and correction procedure is no longer the initial logical state $|\\bar{0}\\rangle$. What is the probability of a logical error occurring?", "solution": "1.  **Relevant Definitions**\n    The Steane code has X-type stabilizers\n    $$g_1=X_4X_5X_6X_7, \\quad g_2=X_2X_3X_6X_7, \\quad g_3=X_1X_3X_5X_7,$$\n    and Z-type stabilizers with the same supports.

Otherwise, the error is the identity $I$.\n\n3.  **Syndrome Measurement**\n    Since the error is a Z-type error, we measure the three X-type stabilizers to get a syndrome $(s_1, s_2, s_3)$.\n    -   $g_1=X_4X_5X_6X_7$ has support disjoint from $E=Z_1Z_2$, so $[E,g_1]=0 \\implies s_1=0$.\n    -   For $g_2=X_2X_3X_6X_7$, the operator $Z_2$ in $E$ anticommutes with $X_2$ in $g_2$. Thus, $\\{E,g_2\\}=0 \\implies s_2=1$.\n    -   For $g_3=X_1X_3X_5X_7$, the operator $Z_1$ in $E$ anticommutes with $X_1$ in $g_3$. Thus, $\\{E,g_3\\}=0 \\implies s_3=1$.\n    The resulting error syndrome is $(s_1,s_2,s_3)=(0,1,1)$.\n\n4.  **Recovery Operation**\n    A standard decoder assumes the minimum weight error that could cause the syndrome. For the Hamming code structure, the syndrome $(0,1,1)$ uniquely identifies a single-qubit error on qubit 3.\n    Therefore, the recovery operation applied is $R=Z_3$.\n\n5.  **Combined Effect on the Code Space**\n    If the error $E=Z_1Z_2$ occurred, the net operator applied to the state is $R E = Z_3 Z_1 Z_2 = Z_1Z_2Z_3$.\n    We can express this net operator in terms of logical operators and stabilizers. Note that the logical operator $\\bar{Z} = Z_1Z_2Z_3Z_4Z_5Z_6Z_7$ and the stabilizer $g_4=Z_4Z_5Z_6Z_7$.\n    Therefore, $\\bar{Z} g_4 = (Z_1Z_2Z_3Z_4Z_5Z_6Z_7)(Z_4Z_5Z_6Z_7) = Z_1Z_2Z_3$.\n    So, the net operator is $R E = \\bar{Z} g_4$.\n    When this operator acts on a state in the code space, like $|\\bar{0}\\rangle$, the stabilizer $g_4$ acts as the identity ($g_4|\\bar{0}\\rangle = |\\bar{0}\\rangle$). The net effect is simply the action of the logical operator $\\bar{Z}$.\n\n6.  **Logical Error Probability**\n    We analyze the two possible cases from the error channel:\n    -   With probability $1-p$, no error occurs ($E=I$). The syndrome is trivial (0,0,0), so no recovery is applied ($R=I$). The state remains $|\\bar{0}\\rangle$.\n    -   With probability $p$, the error $E=Z_1Z_2$ occurs. The net effect on the state is the application of the logical operator $\\bar{Z}$. The final state is $\\bar{Z}|\\bar{0}\\rangle$.\n    By definition, the logical zero state is a $+1$ eigenstate of the logical $\\bar{Z}$ operator: $\\bar{Z}|\\bar{0}\\rangle = +|\\bar{0}\\rangle$. So, even in this case, the final state is still $|\\bar{0}\\rangle$.\n\n    In both scenarios, the final state is the same as the initial state $|\\bar{0}\\rangle$. No logical error occurs.
