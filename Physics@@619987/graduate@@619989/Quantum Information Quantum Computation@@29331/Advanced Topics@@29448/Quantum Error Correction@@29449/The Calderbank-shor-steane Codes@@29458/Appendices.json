It can be specified by a $k \\times n$ generator matrix $G$, whose rows form a basis for the code $C$. Any codeword $c \\in C$ can be written as $c = uG$ for some message vector $u \\in \\mathbb{F}_2^k$. The dimension $k$ of the code is the rank of its generator matrix $G$.\n\nThe CSS construction uses two classical linear codes, $C_1$ and $C_2$, both with the same block length $n$. Let $C_1$ be an $[n, k_1]$ code with generator matrix $G_1$, and $C_2$ be an $[n, k_2]$ code with generator matrix $G_2$. A valid CSS code, denoted $CSS(C_1, C_2)$, can be constructed if $C_2$ is a subcode of $C_1$, i.e., $C_2 \\subset C_1$. This condition is satisfied if every generator of $C_2$ is a codeword in $C_1$.\n\nThe resulting quantum code is an $[[n, k, d]]$ code, where $n$ is the number of physical qubits, $k$ is the number of encoded (logical) qubits, and $d$ is the code distance.

By determining the minimum weight of a physical error that causes such a failure for the Steane code [@problem_id:146576], you will uncover the fundamental mechanism by which logical information can be corrupted despite error correction.", "problem": "The [[7,1,3]] Steane code is a quantum error-correcting code that encodes one logical qubit into seven physical qubits and can correct any single-qubit error. It is a type of Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code built upon the classical [7,4,3] Hamming code.\n\nFor the purposes of this problem, we will only consider Pauli-$X$ errors and their correction. The error detection for this type of error is performed by measuring the Z-type stabilizer generators. A standard choice for these generators is:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ng_1 &= Z_1 Z_3 Z_5 Z_7 \\\\\ng_2 &= Z_2 Z_3 Z_6 Z_7 \\\\\ng_3 &= Z_4 Z_5 Z_6 Z_7\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $Z_i$ is the Pauli-Z operator on qubit $i$. A physical Pauli-$X$ error, $E = \\prod_{i \\in S} X_i$, where $S$ is a subset of the qubit indices $\\{1, ..., 7\\}$, is detected by checking if it commutes or anti-commutes with each of these stabilizers. This produces a 3-bit syndrome vector $s = (s_1, s_2, s_3)$, where $s_j=1$ if $E$ anti-commutes with $g_j$, and $s_j=0$ if it commutes.\n\nA minimum-weight perfect decoder operates as follows: given a syndrome $s$, it identifies the set of all Pauli-X operators that produce $s$. From this set, it selects an operator $R$ with the minimum possible weight (i.e., acting on the minimum number of qubits) and applies its inverse $R^{-1}$ (which for Pauli operators is $R$ itself) as the recovery operation.\n\nA miscorrection occurs if the net operation, $R^{-1}E$, is not an element of the stabilizer group. We are interested in a specific type of failure where the net operation is a non-trivial logical-X operator. A logical-X operator is a Pauli operator of the form $\\prod_{i \\in C} X_i$ that commutes with all stabilizer generators (both X- and Z-type) but is not a stabilizer itself. For the Steane code, the minimum weight of a non-trivial logical-X operator is 3.\n\nDetermine the minimum weight of a physical Pauli-$X$ error, $E$, that a minimum-weight perfect decoder will miscorrect into a non-trivial logical-X operator.", "solution": "1.
