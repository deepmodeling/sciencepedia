The frequency of this resonance is sensitive to various subtle effects, including relativistic shifts. This problem explores the interplay between gravitational effects and thermal motion.\n\nConsider a Mössbauer experiment with a nucleus of mass $M$. The two key relativistic effects on the photon's energy are:\n\n1.  **Gravitational Frequency Shift:** According to the principle of equivalence, a photon's energy changes as it moves through a gravitational potential. For a photon traveling a vertical distance $h$ in a uniform gravitational field with acceleration $g$, the fractional energy shift is $\\frac{\\Delta E}{E} = \\frac{gh}{c^2}$. A photon \"falling\" from a higher position to a lower one is blueshifted (gains energy), while a photon \"climbing\" is redshifted (loses energy).\n\n2.  **Second-Order Doppler Shift (SODS):** Due to relativistic time dilation, the internal clock of a moving atom runs slower than that of a stationary one. This leads to a redshift of its transition frequency. For a nucleus with a mean-square velocity $\\langle v^2 \\rangle$ due to thermal vibrations, the fractional energy shift is $\\frac{\\Delta E}{E} = -\\frac{\\langle v^2 \\rangle}{2c^2}$.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, model the nucleus as a classical particle in a three-dimensional harmonic potential within the crystal lattice. The mean kinetic energy is given by the equipartition theorem: $\\frac{1}{2} M \\langle v^2 \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T$, where $T$ is the temperature and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n**Problem Setup:**\nA Mössbauer source at temperature $T_S$ is placed at a height $h$ directly above a Mössbauer absorber at temperature $T_A$. The experiment is conducted in a laboratory with a uniform downward gravitational acceleration $g$.\n\n**Question:**\nTo achieve perfect resonance, the energy of the gamma ray photon emitted by the source, upon its arrival at the absorber, must exactly match the absorption transition energy of the absorber nucleus. Find the required temperature difference, $\\Delta T = T_S - T_A$, to nullify the gravitational shift, thereby ensuring perfect resonance.
