The reaction mechanism can be complex, involving a coherent sum of different quantum pathways.\n\nConsider a $(p,t)$ reaction where the two neutrons are transferred with zero angular momentum ($L=0$). The total transition amplitude, $T(\\theta)$, as a function of the center-of-mass scattering angle $\\theta$, is the sum of a one-step amplitude $T_{1s}$ (direct transfer of a \"dineutron\" pair) and a two-step amplitude $T_{2s}$ (sequential transfer of single neutrons).
