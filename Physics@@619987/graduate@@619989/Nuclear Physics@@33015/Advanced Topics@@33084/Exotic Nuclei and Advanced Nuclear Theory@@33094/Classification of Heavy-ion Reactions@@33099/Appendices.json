It represents the maximum orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ for which two colliding nuclei can fuse. For $l > l_{crit}$, non-fusion processes like deep-inelastic scattering or quasi-elastic scattering dominate. This critical value can be estimated by analyzing the structure of the effective ion-ion potential, $V_{eff}(r)$.\n\nThe effective potential is the sum of the short-range attractive nuclear potential $V_N(r)$, the long-range repulsive Coulomb potential $V_C(r)$, and the $l$-dependent centrifugal potential $V_{cent}(r)$:\n$$V_{eff}(r, l) = V_N(r) + V_C(r) + V_{cent}(r)$$\nThe competition between these terms creates a potential \"pocket\" (a region of negative potential energy) at small internuclear distances, which can trap the incoming projectile, leading to fusion. As the angular momentum $l$ increases, the repulsive centrifugal potential becomes stronger and \"fills in\" this pocket. The critical angular momentum $l_{crit}$ corresponds to the value of $l$ at which this pocket just vanishes.\n\nConsider a simplified model for the interaction between two nuclei with atomic numbers $Z_1, Z_2$ and reduced mass $\\mu$:\n1.
