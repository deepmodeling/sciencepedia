{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) navigates a path through extremely neutron-rich nuclei, whose lifetimes are governed by beta decay. The rate of these decays is a critical input for r-process models, as it dictates the speed at which matter flows to heavier elements and helps shape the final abundance peaks. This problem [@problem_id:400807] delves into a key component of the decay rate calculation: the phase-space factor, which is highly sensitive to the decay energy. You will explore the significant difference between relativistic and non-relativistic treatments for the high-energy decays characteristic of nuclei far from stability, providing a quantitative understanding of why a proper relativistic approach is essential for accurate r-process simulations.", "problem": "In the theory of nuclear beta decay, the accessible phase space for the emitted electron and antineutrino significantly influences the decay rate. For allowed transitions, and neglecting the Coulomb interaction between the nucleus and the electron (i.e., setting the Fermi function $F(Z, W) = 1$), the dimensionless phase-space factor $f(W_0)$ is given by the integral:\n$$\nf(W_0) = \\int_1^{W_0} p(W) W (W_0 - W)^2 dW\n$$\nHere, $W$ is the total energy of the electron in units of its rest mass energy ($m_e c^2$), $W_0$ is the decay endpoint energy in the same units, and $p(W)$ is the electron's momentum in units of $m_e c$. The endpoint energy $W_0$ is related to the kinetic energy Q-value by $Q = (W_0 - 1)m_e c^2$.\n\nA fully relativistic treatment uses the momentum-energy relation $p_{rel}(W) = \\sqrt{W^2 - 1}$. Substituting this into the integral yields the relativistic phase-space factor, $f_{rel}(W_0)$.\n\nA common approximation, valid for low-energy decays ($W_0 - 1 \\ll 1$), is the non-relativistic model. This approximation involves two assumptions:\n1. The momentum-energy relation is taken to be non-relativistic: $p_{non-rel}(W) = \\sqrt{2(W - 1)}$.\n2. In the term $W$ that multiplies the integrand, which varies slowly compared to other terms, $W$ is approximated by its minimum value, $W \\approx 1$.\nThis procedure yields the non-relativistic phase-space factor, $f_{non-rel}(W_0)$.\n\nFor nucleosynthesis in the r-process, nuclei far from stability can undergo beta decay with very large Q-values, corresponding to $W_0 \\gg 1$. In this high-energy limit, the relativistic and non-relativistic phase-space factors differ substantially. Their ratio, $\\mathcal{R}(W_0) = f_{rel}(W_0) / f_{non-rel}(W_0)$, approaches a power-law dependence on $W_0$.\n\nGiven that for large $W_0$, the ratio has the asymptotic form $\\mathcal{R}(W_0) \\sim C \\cdot W_0^{3/2}$, determine the exact value of the constant coefficient $C$.
