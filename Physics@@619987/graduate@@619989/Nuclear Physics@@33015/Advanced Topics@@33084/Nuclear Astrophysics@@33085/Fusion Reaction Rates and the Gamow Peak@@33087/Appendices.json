The rate of a fusion reaction between two nuclei is determined by the interplay of two competing factors: the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the nuclei's kinetic energies and the quantum mechanical probability of tunneling through their mutual Coulomb repulsion. The reaction rate, as a function of the center-of-mass kinetic energy $E$, is proportional to the product $N(E) \\times P_{\\text{tunnel}}(E)$. The energy at which this product is maximized is known as the Gamow peak energy, $E_0$.\n\nConsider the deuteron-deuteron ($d+d$) fusion reaction within a star's core at a uniform temperature $T$. A deuteron is a nucleus with mass $m_d$ and charge $+e$.

In a weak screening approximation, this effect can be modeled by a potential that effectively raises the kinetic energy of the particles by a constant amount, $U_s$, known as the screening energy.
