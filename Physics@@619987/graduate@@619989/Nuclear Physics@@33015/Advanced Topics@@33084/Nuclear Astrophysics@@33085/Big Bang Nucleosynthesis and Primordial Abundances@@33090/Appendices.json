A key parameter governing this process is the neutron-to-proton mass-energy difference, $Q_0 = m_n c^2 - m_p c^2$. The ratio of neutrons to protons, $n/p$, is maintained in thermal equilibrium through weak interactions (e.g., $n + \\nu_e \\leftrightarrow p + e^-$) at high temperatures. In equilibrium, this ratio is given by the Boltzmann factor $(n/p)_{eq} = \\exp(-Q_0/(k_B T))$.\n\nAs the universe expands and cools, the weak interaction rate falls below the Hubble expansion rate, and the $n/p$ ratio \"freezes out\" at a temperature $T_f$.
