Your task is to derive this sum rule within the framework of the quark-parton model (QPM).\n\n**Background:**\n\n1.  In the QPM, the spin-dependent structure function $g_1^N(x)$ for a nucleon $N$ (either proton $p$ or neutron $n$) is expressed in terms of the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) $\\Delta q_f^N(x) = q_f^{\\uparrow}(x) - q_f^{\\downarrow}(x)$, where $q^{\\uparrow(\\downarrow)}$ is the distribution for a quark with helicity parallel (anti-parallel) to the nucleon's helicity.

For this problem, consider only the up ($u$) and down ($d$) quarks, with charges $e_u$ and $e_d$.\n\n2.

The nucleon axial vector coupling constant, $g_A$, is defined via the matrix element of the axial portion of the weak charged current responsible for neutron beta decay. Isospin symmetry relates different components of the isovector axial current. This leads to a fundamental connection between $g_A$ and the quark helicities within the proton:\n    $$ \\Delta u - \\Delta d = g_A $$\n\n4.
