This practice explores a foundational model where we approximate the nascent fragments at the moment of scission as two touching, uniformly charged spheres.

A significant portion of this energy comes from the Coulomb repulsion between the nascent fragments at the moment of scission (when the nucleus splits).\n\nConsider the fission of a heavy nucleus, specifically $^{236}\\text{U}$ (mass number $A=236$, proton number $Z=92$), into a heavy fragment $(A_H, Z_H)$ and a light fragment $(A_L, Z_L)$. We will model the fission process with the following simplifying assumptions:\n1.  At the scission point, the two fragments are modeled as uniformly charged spheres that are just touching.\n2.  The radius $R_i$ of a fragment nucleus with mass number $A_i$ is given by the formula $R_i = r_0 A_i^{1/3}$, where $r_0$ is the empirical nuclear radius parameter.\n3.  The total kinetic energy of the fragments, once they are infinitely far apart, is equal to the electrostatic potential energy of the two-sphere system at the scission point.\n4.  The charge on each fragment is proportional to its mass, such that the charge-to-mass ratio is conserved from the parent nucleus: $Z_H/A_H = Z_L/A_L = Z/A$.\n\nYour task is to find the integer mass number $A_H$ of the heavy fragment that maximizes the total kinetic energy release under this model. By convention, the heavy fragment is the one with $A_H \\ge A/2$.\n\nThe problem depends on the following constants, which should be kept in symbolic form throughout the derivation: the parent nucleus mass number $A$ and charge number $Z$, the elementary charge $e$, the electric constant $k_e$, and the nuclear radius parameter $r_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks to maximize the Total Kinetic Energy (TKE) of the fission fragments with respect to the mass number of the heavy fragment, $A_H$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationships between the fragment properties based on conservation laws.\nThe parent nucleus is $(A, Z)$. The fragments are $(A_H, Z_H)$ and $(A_L, Z_L)$.\nConservation of mass number:\n$$A_L = A - A_H$$\nConservation of charge number:\n$$Z_L = Z - Z_H$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the TKE is equal to the Coulomb potential energy $U_C$ of the two touching spherical fragments at the scission point.\n$$TKE = U_C = \\frac{k_e Q_H Q_L}{d}$$\nThe charges are $Q_H = Z_H e$ and $Q_L = Z_L e$. The distance $d$ between the centers of the two touching spheres is the sum of their radii, $d = R_H + R_L$.\n$$TKE = \\frac{k_e e^2 Z_H Z_L}{R_H + R_L}$$\n\nNow, we apply the specific models given in the problem statement.\nThe radii are given by $R_i = r_0 A_i^{1/3}$:\n$$R_H = r_0 A_H^{1/3}$$\n$$R_L = r_0 A_L^{1/3} = r_0 (A - A_H)^{1/3}$$\n\nThe fragment charges are determined by the conserved charge-to-mass ratio:\n$$Z_H = Z \\frac{A_H}{A}$$\n$$Z_L = Z \\frac{A_L}{A} = Z \\frac{A - A_H}{A}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the TKE equation:\n$$TKE(A_H) = \\frac{k_e e^2 \\left(Z \\frac{A_H}{A}\\right) \\left(Z \\frac{A - A_H}{A}\\right)}{r_0 A_H^{1/3} + r_0 (A - A_H)^{1/3}}$$\nLet's group the constant terms. Let $C = \\frac{k_e e^2 Z^2}{r_0 A^2}$.\n$$TKE(A_H) = C \\cdot \\frac{A_H(A - A_H)}{A_H^{1/3} + (A - A_H)^{1/3}}$$\n\nTo find the value of $A_H$ that maximizes the TKE, we need to find the maximum of the function $f(A_H) = \\frac{A_H(A - A_H)}{A_H^{1/3} + (A - A_H)^{1/3}}$. We treat $A_H$ as a continuous variable and differentiate $f(A_H)$ with respect to $A_H$, setting the derivative to zero. Let $x = A_H$ for simplicity.\n$$f(x) = \\frac{x(A-x)}{x^{1/3} + (A-x)^{1/3}}$$\nUsing the quotient rule $\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, where $u(x) = x(A-x) = Ax - x^2$ and $v(x) = x^{1/3} + (A-x)^{1/3}$.\n$$u'(x) = A - 2x$$\n$$v'(x) = \\frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3} - \\frac{1}{3}(A-x)^{-2/3}$$\nSetting the numerator of the derivative to zero, $u'v - uv' = 0$:\n$$(A-2x)(x^{1/3} + (A-x)^{1/3}) - x(A-x)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3} - \\frac{1}{3}(A-x)^{-2/3}\\right) = 0$$\n$$(A-2x)(x^{1/3} + (A-x)^{1/3}) = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(x^{1/3}(A-x) - x(A-x)^{1/3}\\right)$$\n\nThis equation appears complex. Let's simplify by a change of variables. Let $z=x^{1/3}$ and $y=(A-x)^{1/3}$. Then $x=z^3$, $A-x=y^3$, and $A=z^3+y^3$. The term $A-2x$ becomes $(z^3+y^3) - 2z^3 = y^3-z^3$.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$(y^3 - z^3)(y+z) = \\frac{1}{3}(z y^3 - z^3 y)$$\nUsing the difference of cubes formula, $y^3-z^3 = (y-z)(y^2+yz+z^2)$:\n$$(y-z)(y^2+yz+z^2)(y+z) = \\frac{1}{3}yz(y^2-z^2)$$\n$$(y-z)(y+z)(y^2+yz+z^2) = \\frac{1}{3}yz(y-z)(y+z)$$\n\nThis equation has two types of solutions.\nCase 1: $y-z = 0$ or $y+z = 0$.\nSince $x>0$ and $A-x>0$, we must have $z>0$ and $y>0$, so $y+z \\neq 0$.\nThe condition $y-z=0$ implies $y=z$.\n$$ (A-x)^{1/3} = x^{1/3} \\implies A-x = x \\implies 2x=A \\implies x = A/2 $$\nThis corresponds to symmetric fission, where $A_H = A_L = A/2$.\n\nCase 2: $y-z \\neq 0$ and $y+z \\neq 0$.\nWe can divide both sides by $(y-z)(y+z)$:\n$$y^2+yz+z^2 = \\frac{1}{3}yz$$\n$$y^2 + \\frac{2}{3}yz + z^2 = 0$$\nSince $z \\neq 0$, we can divide by $z^2$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{y}{z}\\right)^2 + \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{y}{z}\\right) + 1 = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the real ratio $y/z$. The discriminant is $\\Delta = (\\frac{2}{3})^2 - 4(1)(1) = \\frac{4}{9} - 4 = -\\frac{32}{9}$.\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions for $y/z$ in this case.\n\nTherefore, the only extremum of the function $f(A_H)$ occurs at $A_H = A/2$.\n\nTo determine if this is a maximum or a minimum, we can analyze the function $f(x)$ near $x=A/2$. Let $x=A/2+\\delta$ where $\\delta$ is small.\nThe numerator is $u(x) = x(A-x) = (A/2+\\delta)(A/2-\\delta) = (A/2)^2 - \\delta^2$. This is maximized at $\\delta=0$.\nThe denominator is $v(x) = x^{1/3} + (A-x)^{1/3}$. Let's examine its second derivative: $v''(x) = -\\frac{2}{9}x^{-5/3} - \\frac{2}{9}(A-x)^{-5/3}$. Since $x>0$ and $A-x>0$, $v''(x) < 0$, which means $v(x)$ is a concave function and also has a maximum at its critical point $x=A/2$.\nSince we are evaluating the ratio of two functions, both of which are maximal at $x=A/2$, we must be more careful. As shown in the derivation of the extremum, $f'(A/2)=0$. By analyzing the function's symmetry $f(x)=f(A-x)$ and its behavior at the boundaries ($f(0)=f(A)=0$), the extremum at $A/2$ must be a maximum.\n\nThus, the TKE is maximized for symmetric fission, $A_H = A/2$.\nThe problem specifies the fission of $^{236}\\text{U}$, for which the mass number is $A=236$.\nThe mass number of the fragment that maximizes TKE is:\n$$A_H = \\frac{236}{2} = 118$$\nAt this maximum, the heavy and light fragments are identical: $A_H=A_L=118$. So the \"heavy\" fragment mass that maximizes the TKE is 118.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{118} $$", "id": "382928"}, {"introduction": "While Coulomb repulsion explains the kinetic energy, the total energy budget of fission—the Q-value—is governed by quantum mechanical binding energies.

This corresponds to a fission path where nucleon pairs remain unbroken.\n\nHowever, fission can also produce odd-A or odd-odd fragments. The fission of an even-even nucleus into two odd-odd fragments is an energetically less favorable channel because it requires the breaking of nucleon pairs.
