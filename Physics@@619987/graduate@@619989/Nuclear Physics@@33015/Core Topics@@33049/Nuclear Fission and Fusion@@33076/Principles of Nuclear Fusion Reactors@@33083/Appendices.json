Consider the following simplified model:\n\n1.  **Initial State (pre-TQ):** The hot plasma carries a total toroidal current $I_{p0}$. The total inductance of the plasma current loop is $L_0 = L_{ext} + L_{int,0}$, where $L_{ext}$ is the external inductance determined by the plasma's geometry within the vessel, and $L_{int,0}$ is the initial internal inductance related to the plasma's internal magnetic field distribution.\n\n2.  **Thermal Quench Process:** The TQ occurs on a timescale much shorter than the plasma's resistive diffusion time ($L/R$). Therefore, the total poloidal magnetic flux linked by the toroidal plasma current is conserved during the quench.\n\n3.  **Final State (post-TQ):** Immediately after the TQ, the plasma is cold. A significant portion of the current now flows in a broad halo region at the plasma edge.

The total current $I_{p,f}$ is the sum of the core current $I_c$ and the halo current $I_h$. The currents partition between these two paths such that the toroidal voltage drop across each is identical.\n\nUsing this model, derive a symbolic expression for the toroidal halo current fraction, defined as $f_h = I_h / I_{p0}$, where $I_h$ is the toroidal halo current immediately following the thermal quench.", "solution": "1.
