The plasma is composed of deuterium ions (mass $m_D$), tritium ions (mass $m_T$), and electrons. We assume the plasma is quasineutral.\n\nA neutral beam injection (NBI) system is used to heat the plasma and fuel it with high-energy deuterium. As a result, the deuterium ion population consists of two components: a thermal bulk and a non-thermal beam component. A fraction $\\epsilon$ of the deuterium ions are in the non-thermal component, so their density is $n_{Db} = \\epsilon n_D$, where $n_D$ is the total deuterium number density. The remaining fraction, $(1-\\epsilon)$, constitutes the thermal bulk, $n_{D,th}=(1-\\epsilon)n_D$. The tritium ion population is assumed to be purely thermal with density $n_T$.\n\nBoth thermal populations (bulk deuterium and all tritium) are well-described by Maxwellian distributions at the same plasma temperature, $T_p$. The non-thermal deuterium ions, originating from the NBI, are modeled as an isotropic, mono-energetic population, where each ion has a kinetic energy $E_b$.\n\nThe fusion reactivity, $\\langle\\sigma v_{rel}\\rangle$, is defined as the product of the fusion cross-section $\\sigma$ and the relative speed $v_{rel}$ between reacting particles, averaged over their velocity distributions. For the D-T reaction in the energy range of interest, the product $\\sigma(v_{rel})v_{rel}$ can be approximated as being directly proportional to the square of the relative speed, i.e., $\\sigma(v_{rel})v_{rel} = \\mathcal{C} v_{rel}^2$, where $\\mathcal{C}$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nCalculate the reactivity enhancement factor, $F$. This factor is defined as the ratio of the total D-T fusion reactivity in this plasma (including both thermal-thermal and beam-thermal reactions) to the purely thermal reactivity that would occur if all deuterium ions were in the thermal bulk population (i.e., if $\\epsilon=0$).
