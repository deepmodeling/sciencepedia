This phenomenon, known as sub-barrier fusion enhancement, is primarily attributed to the coupling between the relative motion of the colliding nuclei and their internal degrees of freedom, such as collective vibrations, rotations, or nucleon transfer channels.\n\nConsider a simplified quantum mechanical model for such a reaction, involving two channels. The entrance channel (channel 1) corresponds to the two initial nuclei approaching each other. Channel 2 represents a state accessible via a two-nucleon transfer reaction. The interaction in this two-state system is described by a $2 \\times 2$ potential matrix, $\\mathbf{V}(r)$, where $r$ is the separation between the centers of the nuclei.\n\nThe effect of the channel coupling on the fusion process can be understood by examining the system's potential energy landscape. The coupling effectively splits the original, single potential barrier into multiple barriers. The lowest of these new effective barriers dramatically increases the tunneling probability, thus enhancing the fusion cross-section at sub-barrier energies.\n\nWe will analyze this phenomenon by diagonalizing the potential matrix at a single, critical point: the radius of the uncoupled Coulomb barrier, $r = R_B$.\n\n**Given:**\n1.  In the absence of coupling, the potential for the entrance channel, $V_{11}(r)$, has a maximum value $V_B$ at the radius $r=R_B$. This is the uncoupled Coulomb barrier height.\n2.  The second channel is a transfer channel characterized by a reaction Q-value, $Q > 0$ (an exothermic reaction). The diagonal potential term for this channel at the barrier radius is given by $V_{22}(R_B) = V_B + Q$.\n3.  The coupling between the entrance and transfer channels is described by off-diagonal terms in the potential matrix. At the barrier radius, the coupling strength is a real constant, $V_{12}(R_B) = V_{21}(R_B) = F_0$.\n\n**Task:**\nThe eigenvalues of the potential matrix $\\mathbf{V}(R_B)$ represent the new, effective potential barrier heights experienced by the system.

Since alpha particles are composite bosons made of fermions (protons and neutrons), the relative motion of two alpha particles is constrained. Specifically, their relative wavefunction must be orthogonal to the Pauli-forbidden states, which are the states already occupied by the nucleons within the shell model description of the combined system.\n\nFor the $\\alpha-\\alpha$ system, the lowest two harmonic oscillator states for relative motion, the $0s$ and $1s$ states, are Pauli-forbidden. One way to model this is to use a deep local nuclear potential that would, in the absence of the Pauli principle, support two s-wave bound states corresponding to these forbidden states. The physical scattering states are then required to be orthogonal to these forbidden states. This requirement forces the radial wavefunction of physical states to have a specific nodal structure.\n\nConsider a simplified model for the s-wave $\\alpha-\\alpha$ interaction where the nuclear potential is an attractive square well of radius $R_N$ and depth $V_0$:\n$$\nV(r) = \\begin{cases} -V_0 & \\text{for } r \\le R_N \\\\ \\frac{(2e)^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} & \\text{for } r > R_N \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe effect of the Pauli exclusion principle is modeled by fixing the potential depth $V_0$ such that the phase of the zero-energy ($E=0$) interior wavefunction $u(r) = r\\psi(r)$ at the nuclear surface $r=R_N$ matches that of the third s-wave eigenstate of the well.
