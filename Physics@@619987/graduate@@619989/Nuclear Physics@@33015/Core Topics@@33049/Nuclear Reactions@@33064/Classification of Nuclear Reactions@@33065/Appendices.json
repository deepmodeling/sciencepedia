For a nuclear reaction of the type $T(p,e)R$, where a projectile $p$ impinges on a target nucleus $T$, leading to an ejectile $e$ and a residual nucleus $R$, two primary mechanisms are often considered: the **Compound Nucleus (CN)** mechanism and the **Direct Reaction (DR)** mechanism.\n\nIn a CN reaction, the projectile and target fuse to form an excited compound nucleus which subsequently decays statistically. This process \"forgets\" the initial direction of the projectile, leading to an angular distribution of the ejectile $e$ that is symmetric about an angle of $\\pi/2$ in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. In contrast, a DR involves a swift interaction, often at the nuclear surface, where the projectile's momentum is largely transferred to the ejectile. This results in a forward-peaked angular distribution.\n\nA useful quantitative measure to distinguish between these mechanisms is the **forward-backward asymmetry parameter**, $A_{FB}$, defined as:\n$$\nA_{FB} = \\frac{\\sigma_F - \\sigma_B}{\\sigma_F + \\sigma_B}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_F$ is the cross-section integrated over the forward hemisphere ($0 \\le \\theta_{CM} \\le \\pi/2$) and $\\sigma_B$ is the cross-section integrated over the backward hemisphere ($\\pi/2 \\le \\theta_{CM} \\le \\pi$). For a purely CN reaction, $A_{FB} = 0$, while a significant non-zero value indicates the presence of a direct reaction component.\n\nConsider a phenomenological model for the differential cross-section in the CM frame for a specific nuclear reaction, given by the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}(\\theta) = C(K_0 + K_1 \\cos\\theta + K_2 \\cos^2\\theta + K_3 \\cos^3\\theta)\n$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the emission angle of the ejectile in the CM frame, and $C, K_0, K_1, K_2, K_3$ are positive constants that depend on the reaction and the beam energy.\n\nYour task is to calculate the forward-backward asymmetry parameter, $A_{FB}$, in terms of the coefficients $K_0, K_1, K_2$, and $K_3$.", "solution": "The forward-backward asymmetry parameter $A_{FB}$ is defined as:\n$$\nA_{FB} = \\frac{\\sigma_F - \\sigma_B}{\\sigma_F + \\sigma_B}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_F$ and $\\sigma_B$ are the integrated cross-sections for the forward and backward hemispheres, respectively.
