In this model, the projectile is absorbed, and its energy is shared among all nucleons, forming a highly excited, quasi-stable compound state. This state eventually decays, but its formation probability depends on quantum mechanical coupling rules and statistical factors.\n\nConsider the capture of a p-wave neutron by a target nucleus with spin $I$. The neutron has intrinsic spin $s=1/2$ and, being a p-wave, an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. The total angular momentum of the resulting compound nucleus is denoted by $J$.\n\nThe relative probability, $\\mathcal{P}(J)$, for the formation of a compound nucleus with a specific total angular momentum $J$ is governed by the statistical model. Under the common assumption that the transmission coefficients are independent of the channel spin for a fixed partial wave, this probability is proportional to two factors:\n1. The statistical weight of the final state, which is $(2J+1)$.\n2. The number of possible entrance channels that can lead to the state $J$.\n\nAn entrance channel is defined by the channel spin $\\vec{S} = \\vec{I} + \\vec{s}$. The total angular momentum is then formed by coupling the channel spin with the orbital angular momentum: $\\vec{J} = \\vec{S} + \\vec{l}$.\n\nGiven a target nucleus with spin $I = 5/2$, calculate the ratio $R = \\frac{\\mathcal{P}(J=2)}{\\mathcal{P}(J=3)}$ of the formation probabilities for compound nucleus states with total angular momentum $J=2$ versus $J=3$ resulting from p-wave neutron capture.", "solution": "1.
