The nucleus has a ground-state rotational band with spin-parity assignments $J^\\pi = 0^+, 2^+, 4^+, \\dots$ and corresponding energies $E_J = A J(J+1)$, where $A$ is a constant. A charged projectile passes the nucleus, and the interaction is described within the semiclassical approximation, where the projectile follows a classical trajectory and generates a time-dependent electric field that perturbs the nucleus.\n\nWe analyze the process under the following simplifying assumptions:\n1.  The collision is head-on (impact parameter $b=0$). Due to the resulting axial symmetry, the magnetic quantum number $M$ of the nucleus is conserved. Since the nucleus starts in the $J=0, M=0$ ground state, only states with $M=0$ can be populated.\n2.  The interaction is very fast compared to the nuclear transition periods, so we can use the \"sudden approximation\".

The interaction is a pure electric quadrupole (E2) interaction.\n4.  The perturbation is weak, allowing the use of time-dependent perturbation theory.

This is a second-order quantum process where the projectile excites the nucleus to the $2^+$ state, which then interacts with the projectile's field via its static spectroscopic quadrupole moment ($Q_2$) before the projectile has left. This leads to a reorientation of the nuclear spin within the magnetic substates of the $2^+$ level.\n\nThe leading correction to the excitation probability due to this reorientation effect is an interference term, which is first-order in $Q_2$.
