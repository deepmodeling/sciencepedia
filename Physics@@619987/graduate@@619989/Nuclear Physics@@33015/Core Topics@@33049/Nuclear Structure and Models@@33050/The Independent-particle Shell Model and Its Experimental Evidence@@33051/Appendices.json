This practice delves into this crucial refinement by modeling the interaction between a valence proton and neutron using a spin-dependent delta-function potential.

Consider the odd-odd nucleus $^{140}_{57}\\text{La}_{83}$. We model its low-lying excited states as arising from the coupling of a single valence proton and a single valence neutron outside closed shells. The relevant configuration is given by a proton in the $1g_{9/2}$ orbital and a neutron in the $2d_{5/2}$ orbital, denoted as $(\\pi 1g_{9/2})^1 (\\nu 2d_{5/2})^1$.\n\nThe residual interaction between the proton and neutron is approximated by a spin-dependent delta-function potential of the form:\n$$ V(\\vec{r}_p, \\vec{r}_n) = V_0 \\delta(\\vec{r}_p - \\vec{r}_n)(1 + \\alpha \\vec{\\sigma}_p \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}_n) $$\nwhere $\\vec{r}_p, \\vec{r}_n$ are the position vectors and $\\vec{\\sigma}_p, \\vec{\\sigma}_n$ are the Pauli spin operators for the proton and neutron, respectively. $V_0$ is the interaction strength, and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless parameter governing the spin dependence. For this problem, assume an attractive overall interaction ($V_0 < 0$) and take the spin-dependence parameter to be $\\alpha > 0$.\n\nThe energy shift $\\Delta E_J$ for a state of total angular momentum $J$, formed by coupling the proton angular momentum $j_p$ and the neutron angular momentum $j_n$, is given by:\n$$ \\Delta E_J = C \\frac{(2j_p+1)(2j_n+1)}{2J+1} \\left[ \\left| \\langle j_p, \\frac{1}{2}; j_n, -\\frac{1}{2} | J, 0 \\rangle \\right|^2 - \\alpha \\left| \\langle j_p, \\frac{1}{2}; j_n, \\frac{1}{2} | J, 1 \\rangle \\right|^2 \\right] $$\nwhere $C$ is a negative constant proportional to the interaction strength and the radial overlap integral, and $\\langle j_1, m_1; j_2, m_2 | J, M \\rangle$ are Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.\n\nDetermine the ground-state spin $J$ of this configuration by finding which value of $J$ corresponds to the lowest energy state (the most negative energy shift). You may use the fact that the first Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is non-zero only if $l_p+l_n+J$ is even, where $l_p$ and $l_n$ are the orbital angular momenta of the proton and neutron.

Identify Angular Momenta and Possible Total Spins**\n\nThe proton is in a $1g_{9/2}$ state, so its quantum numbers are:\n- Total angular momentum: $j_p = 9/2$\n- Orbital angular momentum: $l_p = 4$ (since 'g' corresponds to $l=4$)\n\nThe neutron is in a $2d_{5/2}$ state, so its quantum numbers are:\n- Total angular momentum: $j_n = 5/2$\n- Orbital angular momentum: $l_n = 2$ (since 'd' corresponds to $l=2$)\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum $J$ of the nucleus are given by the angular momentum coupling rules:\n$$ |j_p - j_n| \\le J \\le j_p + j_n $$\n$$ |9/2 - 5/2| \\le J \\le 9/2 + 5/2 $$\n$$ |4/2| \\le J \\le 14/2 $$\n$$ 2 \\le J \\le 7 $$\nSo, the possible integer values for the total spin are $J \\in \\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Energy Shift Formula**\n\nThe energy shift is given by:\n$$ \\Delta E_J = C \\frac{(2j_p+1)(2j_n+1)}{2J+1} \\left[ T_0(J) - \\alpha T_1(J) \\right] $$\nwhere $T_0(J) = |\\langle j_p, 1/2; j_n, -1/2 | J, 0 \\rangle|^2$ and $T_1(J) = |\\langle j_p, 1/2; j_n, 1/2 | J, 1 \\rangle|^2$.\nWe are given that $C < 0$ (attractive interaction) and $\\alpha=1/4$. To find the minimum energy (most negative $\\Delta E_J$), we need to find the value of $J$ that maximizes the positive quantity:\n$$ K(J) = \\frac{(2j_p+1)(2j_n+1)}{2J+1} \\left[ T_0(J) - \\frac{1}{4} T_1(J) \\right] $$\nThe pre-factor is $(2(9/2)+1)(2(5/2)+1) = 10 \\cdot 6 = 60$.

Apply Selection Rules and Calculate Clebsch-Gordan Coefficients**\n\nWe are given that $T_0(J)$ is non-zero only if $l_p + l_n + J$ is even.\nHere, $l_p + l_n = 4 + 2 = 6$, which is even. Therefore, $T_0(J)$ is non-zero only for even values of $J$.\nFor odd values of $J$, $T_0(J)=0$, which makes the term in the brackets negative (since $T_1(J) \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha>0$). This leads to a positive energy shift $\\Delta E_J > 0$ (since $C<0$). The states with even $J$ will have $T_0(J)>0$, and are candidates for the ground state. The lowest energy state will have a negative energy shift. We thus only need to consider $J \\in \\{2, 4, 6\\}$ for the ground state, but we will calculate for all $J$ for completeness.\n\nWe calculate the required squared Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for each possible value of $J$:\n\n- **For $J=2$ (even):**\n  $T_0(2) = |\\langle 9/2, 1/2; 5/2, -1/2 | 2, 0 \\rangle|^2 = 13/66$\n  $T_1(2) = |\\langle 9/2, 1/2; 5/2, 1/2 | 2, 1 \\rangle|^2 = 35/132$\n- **For $J=3$ (odd):**\n  $T_0(3) = 0$\n  $T_1(3) = |\\langle 9/2, 1/2; 5/2, 1/2 | 3, 1 \\rangle|^2 = 1/12$\n- **For $J=4$ (even):**\n  $T_0(4) = |\\langle 9/2, 1/2; 5/2, -1/2 | 4, 0 \\rangle|^2 = 2/21$\n  $T_1(4) = |\\langle 9/2, 1/2; 5/2, 1/2 | 4, 1 \\rangle|^2 = 1/14$\n- **For $J=5$ (odd):**\n  $T_0(5) = 0$\n  $T_1(5) = |\\langle 9/2, 1/2; 5/2, 1/2 | 5, 1 \\rangle|^2 = 1/6$\n- **For $J=6$ (even):**\n  $T_0(6) = |\\langle 9/2, 1/2; 5/2, -1/2 | 6, 0 \\rangle|^2 = 9/154$\n  $T_1(6) = |\\langle 9/2, 1/2; 5/2, 1/2 | 6, 1 \\rangle|^2 = 25/308$\n- **For $J=7$ (odd):**\n  $T_0(7) = 0$\n  $T_1(7) = |\\langle 9/2, 1/2; 5/2, 1/2 | 7, 1 \\rangle|^2 = 1/2$\n\n**4.
