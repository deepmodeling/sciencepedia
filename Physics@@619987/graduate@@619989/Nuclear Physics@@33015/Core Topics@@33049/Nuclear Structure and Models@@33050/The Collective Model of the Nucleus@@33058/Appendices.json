In our two-fermion system, the ground state $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$ has both particles in the lower level $|1\\rangle$. An excited state $|\\Psi_m\\rangle$ is formed by promoting one particle from level $|1\\rangle$ to level $|2\\rangle$. Since the particles are spin-1/2 fermions, we can have a spin-up particle excited or a spin-down particle excited. Thus, there are two such excited states, each with an excitation energy $E_m - E_0 = \\Delta E$.\n\n3. The total angular momentum operator is $\\hat{J}_x = \\hat{j}_x(1) + \\hat{j}_x(2)$.

Let's re-state step 5.\n\n5. Multiplying by the prefactor $2\\hbar^2$ from the Inglis formula gives the final moment of inertia. Oh, wait, the Inglis formula is $\\mathcal{I} = 2 \\sum ... / (E_m-E_0)$, not $2\\hbar^2 \\sum...$ My mistake, the problem statement uses a version with $\\hbar$ absorbed in the matrix element. Let's re-check the standard Inglis formula: $\\mathcal{I} = 2\\hbar^2 \\sum ...$. Ah, the problem has defined the matrix element as $j\\hbar$, which includes $\\hbar$. So the formula should be $\\mathcal{I} = 2 \\sum ...$. Let's re-read the problem. The formula given is $\\mathcal{I} = 2\\hbar^2 \\sum ...$. The matrix element is $\\langle 2|\\hat{j}_x|1\\rangle = j\\hbar$. OK, my first reading was correct. Let's restart the solution.\n\n1. The Inglis cranking formula is $\\mathcal{I} = 2\\hbar^2 \\sum_{m \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle \\Psi_m | \\hat{J}_x | \\Psi_0 \\rangle|^2}{E_m - E_0}$.\n\n2. The system has two possible one-particle, one-hole excited states $|\\Psi_m\\rangle$, each with energy $E_m - E_0 = \\Delta E$.\n\n3. The relevant many-body matrix element is $\\langle \\Psi_m | \\hat{J}_x | \\Psi_0 \\rangle = \\langle 2 | \\hat{j}_x | 1 \\rangle = j\\hbar$.\n\n4. The summation part of the formula becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{m \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle \\Psi_m | \\hat{J}_x | \\Psi_0 \\rangle|^2}{E_m - E_0} = \\frac{|j\\hbar|^2}{\\Delta E} + \\frac{|j\\hbar|^2}{\\Delta E} = 2 \\frac{j^2\\hbar^2}{\\Delta E} $$\n\n5. Plugging this into the full formula for $\\mathcal{I}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{I} = 2\\hbar^2 \\left( 2 \\frac{j^2\\hbar^2}{\\Delta E} \\right) $$\nThis doesn't seem right. Let's check the units. $j$ is dimensionless. $\\mathcal{I}$ should be Energy * Time^2. Right side is $\\hbar^2 * (\\hbar^2 / E) = (E \\cdot T)^2 \\cdot T^2 / (E \\cdot T^2) = E^2 T^4 / (E T^2) = E T^2$. The units are correct. But the expression is $\\mathcal{I} \\propto \\hbar^4$. That seems unusual.\n\nLet's re-read the standard definition. The angular momentum operator $J_x$ is usually dimensionless (in units of $\\hbar$). So $\\langle|\\hat{J}_x/\\hbar|\\rangle$ would be a number. In that case, the formula is $\\mathcal{I} = 2\\hbar^2 \\sum ...$. If the matrix element given $\\langle|\\hat{J}_x|\\rangle$ already has units of $\\hbar$, then maybe the prefactor $2\\hbar^2$ is wrong.\nLet's assume the problem meant for $\\hat{J}_x$ to be dimensionless. Let $\\hat{J}_x' = \\hat{J}_x / \\hbar$. Then $\\langle 2|\\hat{j}_x'|1\\rangle = j$. The formula becomes $\\mathcal{I} = 2\\hbar^2 \\sum \\frac{|\\langle\\Psi_m|\\hat{J}_x'|\\Psi_0\\rangle|^2}{E_m - E_0}$.\nThe sum is $2 \\frac{j^2}{\\Delta E}$. So $\\mathcal{I} = 2\\hbar^2 (2 \\frac{j^2}{\\Delta E}) = \\frac{4j^2\\hbar^2}{\\Delta E}$.\nThis looks much more standard. The confusion was in the problem text giving $\\langle \\hat{J}_x \\rangle$ with units of $\\hbar$ and also having $\\hbar^2$ in the formula. It's more likely that the formula as written is correct and the matrix element is for the dimensionless operator $J_x/\\hbar$.\nI'll rewrite the solution to be clear about this assumption.\n\n1. The Inglis cranking formula for the moment of inertia is $\\mathcal{I} = 2 \\hbar^2 \\sum_{m \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle \\Psi_m | \\hat{J}_x | \\Psi_0 \\rangle|^2}{E_m - E_0}$. In this standard formulation, $\\hat{J}_x$ is the dimensionless angular momentum operator (in units of $\\hbar$).\n\n2. We are given the matrix element $\\langle 2 | \\hat{j}_x | 1 \\rangle = j \\hbar$. This implies the matrix element of the dimensionless single-particle operator $\\hat{j}'_x = \\hat{j}_x / \\hbar$ is $\\langle 2 | \\hat{j}'_x | 1 \\rangle = j$. The total operator is $\\hat{J}'_x = \\hat{J}_x/\\hbar$.\n\n3. The system consists of two identical fermions. The ground state $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$ has both fermions in the lower level. There are two one-particle-one-hole excited states $|\\Psi_m\\rangle$, formed by promoting either the spin-up or spin-down fermion. The excitation energy for both is $E_m - E_0 = \\Delta E$.\n\n4. The matrix element of the total dimensionless operator is $\\langle \\Psi_m | \\hat{J}'_x | \\Psi_0 \\rangle = \\langle 2 | \\hat{j}'_x | 1 \\rangle = j$.\n\n5. The sum in the Inglis formula contains two identical terms:\n$$ \\sum_{m \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle \\Psi_m | \\hat{J}'_x | \\Psi_0 \\rangle|^2}{E_m - E_0} = \\frac{j^2}{\\Delta E} + \\frac{j^2}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{2j^2}{\\Delta E} $$\n\n6. Substituting this into the full formula gives the moment of inertia:\n$$ \\mathcal{I} = 2\\hbar^2 \\left( \\frac{2j^2}{\\Delta E} \\right) = \\frac{4j^2\\hbar^2}{\\Delta E} $$\nThis derivation is sound and leads to the provided answer.

This requires us to determine the configurations and energies of the ground state and the terminating state.\n\nFirst, let's determine the spin of the band-terminating state, $I_{term}$. This state corresponds to the maximum possible projection of the total angular momentum, achieved by aligning the individual particle angular momenta. For four identical particles, the Pauli exclusion principle requires them to occupy different quantum states, which are labeled by the magnetic quantum number $m$. To maximize the total angular momentum projection $M = \\sum m_i$, we must place the particles in the states with the highest available $m$ values.\n\nThe possible values for $m$ for a $j=13/2$ shell are $m = -13/2, -11/2, \\dots, 11/2, 13/2$. The four highest values are $13/2, 11/2, 9/2, 7/2$.\nThe maximum total angular momentum projection is:\n$$\nM_{max} = \\frac{13}{2} + \\frac{11}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} + \\frac{7}{2} = \\frac{13+11+9+7}{2} = \\frac{40}{2} = 20\n$$\nThis maximum projection corresponds to the spin of the terminating state, so $I_{term} = 20$. The configuration for this state is $\\{m_1, m_2, m_3, m_4\\} = \\{13/2, 11/2, 9/2, 7/2\\}$.\n\nNext, we identify the ground state configuration. The ground state has total angular momentum $I=0$, which implies a total projection $M=0$. The energy is minimized by placing the four particles in the single-particle orbitals with the lowest energies. The single-particle energies are given by $\\epsilon_m = K[3m^2 - j(j+1)]$. With $j=13/2$, we have $j(j+1) = (13/2)(15/2) = 195/4$.\nSince $K>0$, the energy $\\epsilon_m$ is minimized when the term $[3m^2 - j(j+1)]$ is most negative. This occurs for the smallest values of $|m|$.\nFor an $I=0$ state made of four particles, we must form pairs with opposite $m$ values, i.e., $(m, -m)$, to make the total projection zero.
