For quadrupole deformations, the shape of the nucleus is described by a set of five deformation parameters $\\alpha_{2\\mu}$ ($\\mu = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$). In the simple harmonic vibrator model, the Hamiltonian is quantized, leading to elementary excitations called phonons.\n\nThe excitations are created and annihilated by phonon operators $b_{2\\mu}^\\dagger$ and $b_{2\\mu}$, respectively, which obey standard bosonic commutation relations:\n$[b_{2\\mu}, b_{2\\nu}] = 0$, $[b_{2\\mu}^\\dagger, b_{2\\nu}^\\dagger] = 0$, and $[b_{2\\mu}, b_{2\\nu}^\\dagger] = \\delta_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nThe states of the nucleus are characterized by the number of phonons, $N$.\n- The ground state, $|0_1^+\\rangle$, is the phonon vacuum ($N=0$), with total angular momentum $I=0$.

For a system of identical fermions occupying a single shell with half-integer angular momentum $j$, a quadrupole phonon, which carries angular momentum $J=2$, can be constructed from a pair of fermions. The creation operator for such a pair with magnetic projection $M$ can be written as:\n$$\nD^{\\dagger}_{M} = \\mathcal{N} \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle j m_1 j m_2 | 2 M \\rangle c^{\\dagger}_{j m_1} c^{\\dagger}_{j m_2}\n$$\nwhere $c^{\\dagger}_{j m}$ is the creation operator for a fermion in the single-particle state with angular momentum $j$ and projection $m$, $\\langle j m_1 j m_2 | 2 M \\rangle$ is a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, and $\\mathcal{N}$ is a normalization constant.\n\nUnlike true bosons, these fermion-pair \"phonons\" are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, which limits the number of such pairs that can exist within the finite single-particle space of the $j$-shell. This effect is known as Pauli blocking.\n\nTo investigate this limit, consider the \"stretched\" configuration, which is built by exclusively using the pair creation operator with the maximum possible magnetic projection, $M=2$.

Therefore, the state $|\\Psi_N\\rangle$ has a total magnetic projection $M_{\\text{tot}} = 2N$.\n\n2.  For the state $|\\Psi_N\\rangle$ to be non-zero, it must be physically possible to construct a quantum state for $2N$ identical fermions in the $j$-shell that has a total magnetic projection of $M_{\\text{tot}} = 2N$. The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that each fermion must occupy a unique single-particle state, specified by the magnetic quantum number $m$.\n\n3.  The single-particle states available within the $j$-shell are labeled by $m$, where $m$ can take $2j+1$ distinct values: $m \\in \\{-j, -j+1, \\dots, j-1, j\\}$.\n\n4.  To construct a state of $2N$ fermions, we must choose $2N$ distinct single-particle states, i.e., $2N$ distinct values of $m$ from the available set. Let these be $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_{2N}$. The total magnetic projection of this state is $M = \\sum_{i=1}^{2N} m_i$.\n\n5.  To determine if a state with $M_{\\text{tot}} = 2N$ is possible, we can find the maximum possible total magnetic projection, $M_{\\text{max}}(2N)$, that can be achieved with $2N$ fermions. This maximum is obtained by placing the $2N$ fermions into the single-particle states with the highest available $m$ values.\n\n6.  The $2N$ highest available values of $m$ are $j, j-1, j-2, \\dots, j-(2N-1)$. For this to be possible, the number of particles $2N$ cannot exceed the total number of available states, $2j+1$.\n\n7.
