Consider such a nucleus where the valence proton is in a $2s_{1/2}$ orbital and the valence neutron is in a $1d_{3/2}$ orbital. The total angular momentum of the nucleus, $\\vec{J}$, is the sum of the individual angular momenta of the valence nucleons, $\\vec{J} = \\vec{j}_p + \\vec{j}_n$. This coupling gives rise to a multiplet of states with different possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number $J$.\n\nYour task is to determine the magnetic moment of the ground state of this $(\\pi 2s_{1/2})(\\nu 1d_{3/2})$ configuration.\n\nTo do this, you must first find the ground-state spin and parity, $J^\\Pi_{gs}$.\n\n1.  The possible values for $J$ form a multiplet. First, attempt to find the ground-state spin $J_{gs}$ by considering the energy splitting caused by a residual proton-neutron quadrupole-quadrupole interaction, $V_{QQ} = -k \\, \\hat{Q}^{(2)}_p \\cdot \\hat{Q}^{(2)}_n$, where $k$ is a positive constant. The energy shift for a state of spin $J$ is given by:\n    $$ \\Delta E_{QQ}(J) = \\langle (j_p j_n) J | V_{QQ} | (j_p j_n) J \\rangle = -k (-1)^{j_p+j_n+J} \\begin{Bmatrix} j_p & j_n & J \\\\ j_n & j_p & 2 \\end{Bmatrix} \\langle j_p || \\hat{Q}^{(2)}_p || j_p \\rangle \\langle j_n || \\hat{Q}^{(2)}_n || j_n \\rangle $$\n    The reduced matrix element of the quadrupole operator $\\hat{Q}^{(2)}$ for a single nucleon state $|nlj\\rangle$ is proportional to the reduced matrix element of the spherical harmonic $Y_2$, which is non-zero only for states with orbital angular momentum $l \\ge 1$.\n\n2.  If the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction fails to lift the degeneracy of the multiplet, you should instead use a short-range attractive (spin-independent) central force, modeled as a delta potential, $V_\\delta = V_0 \\delta(\\vec{r}_p - \\vec{r}_n)$ with $V_0  0$. For a configuration where the sum of orbital angular momenta $l_p+l_n$ is even, the energy shift for a state of spin $J$ is given by:\n    $$ \\Delta E_\\delta(J) = C \\left[ (2j_p+1)(2j_n+1) \\begin{pmatrix} j_p  j_n  J \\\\ 1/2  -1/2  0 \\end{pmatrix}^2 \\right] $$\n    where $C$ is a negative constant proportional to $V_0$ and a radial integral. The ground state corresponds to the lowest (most negative) energy. For reference, the relevant squared 3-j symbols are: $\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2  3/2  1 \\\\ 1/2  -1/2  0 \\end{pmatrix}^2 = 1/6$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} 1/2  3/2  2 \\\\ 1/2  -1/2  0 \\end{pmatrix}^2 = 1/12$.\n\n3.  Once the ground-state spin $J_{gs}$ is determined, calculate the magnetic moment $\\mu$ for this state. The magnetic moment of a two-nucleon configuration is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\mu(J) = \\mu_N \\left[ \\frac{J}{2} (g_p + g_n) + \\frac{j_p(j_p+1) - j_n(j_n+1)}{2(J+1)} (g_p - g_n) \\right] $$\n    where $\\mu_N$ is the nuclear magneton, and $g_p, g_n$ are the g-factors of the valence proton and neutron, respectively. These g-factors are given by the Schmidt formulas:\n    $$ g_j = g_l \\pm \\frac{g_s - g_l}{2l+1} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad j = l \\pm 1/2 $$\n    Use the standard g-factors for the proton ($g_l^{(p)}=1, g_s^{(p)}$) and the neutron ($g_l^{(n)}=0, g_s^{(n)}$). Provide the final magnetic moment as an expression in terms of $\\mu_N$, $g_s^{(p)}$, and $g_s^{(n)}$.", "solution": "1. The valence orbitals are for a proton in $2s_{1/2}$ ($j_p=1/2, l_p=0$) and a neutron in $1d_{3/2}$ ($j_n=3/2, l_n=2$). The possible total angular momenta are $J=1, 2$, and the parity is $\\Pi = (-1)^{l_p+l_n} = (-1)^{0+2}=+$.\n\n2.  For the Quadrupole-Quadrupole interaction: since the proton is in an $l_p=0$ state, its reduced quadrupole matrix element is zero, $\\langle j_p || \\hat{Q}^{(2)} || j_p \\rangle \\propto \\langle l_p=0 || Y_2 || l_p=0 \\rangle = 0$. Therefore, the energy shift is $\\Delta E_{QQ}(J)=0$ for both $J=1$ and $J=2$. The interaction does not split the multiplet.\n\n3.  For the Delta interaction: the energy shift is given by $\\Delta E_\\delta(J) = C \\cdot (2j_p+1)(2j_n+1) \\begin{pmatrix} j_p  j_n  J \\\\ 1/2  -1/2  0 \\end{pmatrix}^2$, with $C0$.

Thus, $\\Delta E_\\delta(1)  \\Delta E_\\delta(2)$, and the ground state has $J_{gs}=1$ and $\\Pi_{gs}=+$.\n\n4.  The magnetic moment for the $J=1$ ground state is calculated using the general formula:\n$$\n\\mu(J=1) = \\mu_N \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(g_p+g_n) + \\frac{j_p(j_p+1)-j_n(j_n+1)}{2(1+1)}(g_p-g_n) \\right]\n$$\nFirst, we compute the spin-dependent terms: $j_p(j_p+1) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{3}{4}$ and $j_n(j_n+1) = \\frac{3}{2}(\\frac{5}{2}) = \\frac{15}{4}$. The difference is $j_p(j_p+1)-j_n(j_n+1) = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{15}{4} = -3$.\nSubstituting this into the formula for $\\mu(1)$:\n$$\n\\mu(1) = \\mu_N \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(g_p+g_n) - \\frac{3}{4}(g_p-g_n) \\right] = \\mu_N \\left[ (\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{3}{4})g_p + (\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{3}{4})g_n \\right] = \\mu_N \\left[ -\\frac{1}{4}g_p + \\frac{5}{4}g_n \\right]\n$$\n\n5.
