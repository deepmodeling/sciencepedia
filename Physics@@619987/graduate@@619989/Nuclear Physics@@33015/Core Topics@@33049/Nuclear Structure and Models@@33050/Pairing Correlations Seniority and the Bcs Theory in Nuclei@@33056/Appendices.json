Particle Number Variance in the Two-Quasiparticle State**\n\nThe 2QP state is $|\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle = \\alpha_{k_a}^\\dagger \\alpha_{k_b}^\\dagger |\\Psi_{BCS}\\rangle$, where $k_a$ belongs to pair $j_a$ and $k_b$ belongs to pair $j_b$ with $j_a \\neq j_b$. We use the blocking property. First, create one QP:\n$$\n\\alpha_{k_a}^\\dagger |\\Psi_{BCS}\\rangle = a_{k_a}^\\dagger \\prod_{j \\neq j_a} (u_j + v_j a_j^\\dagger a_{-j}^\\dagger) |0\\rangle = a_{k_a}^\\dagger |\\Psi'_{BCS}\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $|\\Psi'_{BCS}\\rangle$ is a BCS-like state for all pairs except $j_a$. Now, apply the second QP creation operator:\n$$\n|\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle = \\alpha_{k_b}^\\dagger (a_{k_a}^\\dagger |\\Psi'_{BCS}\\rangle)\n$$\nSince $j_b \\neq j_a$, the state $k_b$ is not involved with particle $k_a$. The operators $\\alpha_{k_b}^\\dagger$ and $a_{k_a}^\\dagger$ act on different Hilbert spaces and thus commute.\n$$\n|\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle = a_{k_a}^\\dagger \\alpha_{k_b}^\\dagger |\\Psi'_{BCS}\\rangle\n$$\nApplying the blocking property again for $\\alpha_{k_b}^\\dagger$ on $|\\Psi'_{BCS}\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{k_b}^\\dagger |\\Psi'_{BCS}\\rangle = a_{k_b}^\\dagger \\prod_{j \\neq j_a, j_b} (u_j + v_j a_j^\\dagger a_{-j}^\\dagger) |0\\rangle\n$$\nSo the 2QP state is:\n$$\n|\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle = a_{k_a}^\\dagger a_{k_b}^\\dagger \\prod_{j \\neq j_a, j_b} (u_j + v_j a_j^\\dagger a_{-j}^\\dagger) |0\\rangle\n$$\nThis state has a definite particle number for the states $k_a$ and $k_b$ (it's 1 for each), and the time-reversed partners $-k_a$ and $-k_b$ are empty. The other pairs $j \\neq j_a, j_b$ remain in a BCS-type superposition.\nThe total particle number operator can be split:\n$$\n\\hat{N} = (a_{k_a}^\\dagger a_{k_a} + a_{-k_a}^\\dagger a_{-k_a}) + (a_{k_b}^\\dagger a_{k_b} + a_{-k_b}^\\dagger a_{-k_b}) + \\sum_{j \\neq j_a, j_b} \\hat{N}_j\n$$\nIn the state $|\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle$, the occupancies of the states in pairs $j_a$ and $j_b$ are fixed. We have one particle in state $k_a$ and zero in $-k_a$, and one in $k_b$ and zero in $-k_b$. So the number of particles from these two pairs is $1+1=2$. The particle number operator acts on this state as:\n$$\n\\hat{N} |\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle = \\left( 2 + \\sum_{j \\neq j_a, j_b} \\hat{N}_j \\right) |\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle\n$$\nThe variance is only due to the fluctuating part:\n$$\n\\sigma_N^2(|\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle) = \\left\\langle \\left( \\Delta \\left( 2 + \\sum_{j \\neq j_a, j_b} \\hat{N}_j \\right) \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\Delta \\sum_{j \\neq j_a, j_b} \\hat{N}_j \\right)^2 \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe state for the pairs $j \\neq j_a, j_b$ is a BCS state. Thus, we can use our previous result for the variance, summing only over the unblocked pairs:\n$$\n\\sigma_N^2(|\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle) = \\sum_{j \\neq j_a, j_b} 4u_j^2 v_j^2\n$$\n\n**3. Change in Variance**\n\nFinally, we compute the difference:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\sigma_N^2) = \\sigma_N^2(|\\Psi_{k_a, k_b}\\rangle) - \\sigma_N^2(|\\Psi_{BCS}\\rangle)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(\\sigma_N^2) = \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq j_a, j_b} 4u_j^2 v_j^2 \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{j>0} 4u_j^2 v_j^2 \\right)\n$$\nThe sum over unblocked pairs is the sum over all pairs minus the terms for $j_a$ and $j_b$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j \\neq j_a, j_b} 4u_j^2 v_j^2 = \\sum_{j>0} 4u_j^2 v_j^2 - 4u_{j_a}^2 v_{j_a}^2 - 4u_{j_b}^2 v_{j_b}^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta(\\sigma_N^2)$:\n$$\n\\Delta(\\sigma_N^2) = (\\sum_{j>0} 4u_j^2 v_j^2 - 4u_{j_a}^2 v_{j_a}^2 - 4u_{j_b}^2 v_{j_b}^2) - \\sum_{j>0} 4u_j^2 v_j^2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta(\\sigma_N^2) = -4u_{j_a}^2 v_{j_a}^2 - 4u_{j_b}^2 v_{j_b}^2 = -4(u_{j_a}^2 v_{j_a}^2 + u_{j_b}^2 v_{j_b}^2)\n$$\nThe creation of two quasiparticles in different pairs reduces the particle number fluctuation by \"freezing\" the occupation of the two blocked pairs, removing their contribution to the total variance.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-4(u_{j_a}^2 v_{j_a}^2 + u_{j_b}^2 v_{j_b}^2)}\n$$", "id": "401913"}, {"introduction": "While the pairing interaction is neatly described by the seniority quantum number, realistic nuclear Hamiltonians include other components, such as the long-range quadrupole-quadrupole force, which do not conserve seniority.
