Consider two identical nucleons (e.g., two neutrons) in a $(1d)^2$ configuration. The single-particle states are those of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator with frequency $\\omega$ and nucleon mass $m$. The two nucleons interact via a zero-range, spin-independent central potential, often called a delta-function interaction, given by $V(\\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2) = -V_0 \\delta(\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2)$, where $V_0 > 0$.\n\nFor identical nucleons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange.
