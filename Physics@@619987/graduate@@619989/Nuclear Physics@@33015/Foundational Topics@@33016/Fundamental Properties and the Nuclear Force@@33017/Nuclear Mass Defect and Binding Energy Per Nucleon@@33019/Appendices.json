The problem is a standard, formalizable exercise in nuclear chemistry and physics. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Binding Energy per Nucleon**\n\nThe nuclear binding energy, $B$, of a nuclide is the energy equivalent of the mass defect, $\\Delta m$. The mass defect is the difference between the total mass of the constituent free nucleons (protons and neutrons) and the mass of the assembled nucleus.\n\nLet us consider a generic nuclide $^{A}_{Z}X$ with $Z$ protons, $N$ neutrons, and a mass number $A = Z+N$. Let $m_p$ be the mass of a proton, $m_n$ be the mass of a neutron, and $M_{\\text{nuc}}(^{A}_{Z}X)$ be the mass of the nucleus. The mass defect is defined as:\n$$ \\Delta m = (Z m_p + N m_n) - M_{\\text{nuc}}(^{A}_{Z}X) $$\nThe binding energy is then given by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence relation:\n$$ B = (\\Delta m)c^2 = \\left[ (Z m_p + N m_n) - M_{\\text{nuc}}(^{A}_{Z}X) \\right] c^2 $$\nExperimentally, it is the atomic masses that are tabulated with high precision, not the nuclear masses. The atomic mass, $M_{\\text{atom}}(^{A}_{Z}X)$, is the mass of the nucleus plus the mass of its $Z$ electrons, reduced by the total binding energy of the electrons, $B_e$.\n$$ M_{\\text{atom}}(^{A}_{Z}X) = M_{\\text{nuc}}(^{A}_{Z}X) + Z m_e - \\frac{B_e}{c^2} $$\nThe problem instructs to neglect the electron binding energies ($B_e \\approx 0$), which are on the order of $\\mathrm{keV}$ and are insignificant compared to the nuclear binding energies on the order of $\\mathrm{MeV}$. Thus, we can approximate the nuclear mass as:\n$$ M_{\\text{nuc}}(^{A}_{Z}X) \\approx M_{\\text{atom}}(^{A}_{Z}X) - Z m_e $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for binding energy:\n$$ B \\approx \\left[ Z m_p + N m_n - (M_{\\text{atom}}(^{A}_{Z}X) - Z m_e) \\right] c^2 $$\nRearranging the terms, we group the proton and electron masses:\n$$ B \\approx \\left[ Z(m_p + m_e) + N m_n - M_{\\text{atom}}(^{A}_{Z}X) \\right] c^2 $$\nThe mass of a neutral hydrogen atom, $m_{\\mathrm{H}}$, is $m_p + m_e$ (again, neglecting the tiny electron binding energy of hydrogen, as specified by the problem's approximations). Therefore, we can substitute $Z m_{\\mathrm{H}}$ for $Z(m_p + m_e)$:\n$$ B \\approx \\left[ Z m_{\\mathrm{H}} + N m_n - M_{\\text{atom}}(^{A}_{Z}X) \\right] c^2 $$\nThis is the desired expression for the total nuclear binding energy in terms of experimentally accessible atomic masses. The binding energy per nucleon, $B/A$, is simply this quantity divided by the mass number, $A$:\n$$ \\frac{B}{A} \\approx \\frac{\\left[ Z m_{\\mathrm{H}} + N m_n - M_{\\text{atom}}(^{A}_{Z}X) \\right] c^2}{A} $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation for $^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}$**\n\nWe now apply this formula to the given data for $^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}$.\n- Given: $Z=26$, $A=56$, $N=A-Z=30$.\n- Masses: $m_{\\mathrm{H}}=1.00782503223\\,\\mathrm{u}$, $m_{n}=1.00866491588\\,\\mathrm{u}$, $M_{\\mathrm{atom}}(^{56}\\mathrm{Fe})=55.93493633\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\nFirst, calculate the mass of the constituent particles in atomic mass units:\n$$ \\text{Mass of constituents} = Z m_{\\mathrm{H}} + N m_n $$\n$$ \\text{Mass of constituents} = 26 \\times (1.00782503223\\,\\mathrm{u}) + 30 \\times (1.00866491588\\,\\mathrm{u}) $$\n$$ \\text{Mass of constituents} = 26.20345083798\\,\\mathrm{u} + 30.2599474764\\,\\mathrm{u} = 56.46339831438\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\nNext, calculate the mass defect, $\\Delta m$:\n$$ \\Delta m = (Z m_{\\mathrm{H}} + N m_n) - M_{\\mathrm{atom}}(^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}) $$\n$$ \\Delta m = 56.46339831438\\,\\mathrm{u} - 55.93493633\\,\\mathrm{u} = 0.52846198438\\,\\mathrm{u} $$\nNow, convert this mass defect into total binding energy, $B$, using the given conversion factor:\n$$ B = (\\Delta m) c^2 = (0.52846198438\\,\\mathrm{u}) c^2 $$\n$$ B = 0.52846198438 \\times (1\\,\\mathrm{u}\\,c^2) = 0.52846198438 \\times 931.49410242\\,\\mathrm{MeV} $$\n$$ B \\approx 492.26084\\,\\mathrm{MeV} $$\nFinally, compute the binding energy per nucleon, $B/A$:\n$$ \\frac{B}{A} = \\frac{492.26084\\,\\mathrm{MeV}}{56} \\approx 8.790372\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\text{nucleon}} $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as instructed, the result is $8.790$ $\\mathrm{MeV}$ per nucleon.\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Explanation of the $B/A$ Curve Maximum**\n\nThe behavior of the binding energy per nucleon ($B/A$) as a function of mass number ($A$) is dictated by the interplay between the strong nuclear force and the electromagnetic (Coulomb) force.\n\n1.  **Strong Nuclear Force:** This force is powerfully attractive between all nucleons (protons and neutrons) but is extremely short-ranged. A key property is *saturation*: a nucleon interacts strongly only with its immediate neighbors. This leads to a contribution to the binding energy that is roughly proportional to the number of nucleons, $A$. This effect alone would cause the $B/A$ curve to be nearly flat for all but the lightest nuclei.\n\n2.  **Coulomb Force:** This force causes electrostatic repulsion between protons. It is weaker than the strong force but is long-ranged, meaning every proton in the nucleus repels every other proton. The total repulsive energy is proportional to the number of proton pairs, $\\frac{Z(Z-1)}{2}$, which scales approximately as $Z^2$. This repulsive contribution reduces the net binding energy. Since it acts over the entire nucleus, its destabilizing effect per nucleon increases as the nucleus grows larger.\n\nThe shape of the $B/A$ curve is a result of the competition between these two effects.\n- For light nuclei (low $A$), the attractive strong force dominates. As nucleons are added, the number of strong-force bonds increases faster than the Coulomb repulsion, so $B/A$ rises sharply.\n- For intermediate-mass nuclei, the saturation of the strong force means its contribution to $B/A$ begins to level off. Simultaneously, the cumulative $Z^2$ effect of Coulomb repulsion becomes increasingly significant.\n- The curve reaches a maximum in the iron-group of nuclides (around $A \\approx 56$ to $62$), where $^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}$ is a prominent example. These nuclides represent the optimal balance: they are large enough to maximize the nearest-neighbor strong force attractions but not so large that the long-range Coulomb repulsion between their numerous protons drastically lowers the net binding energy.\n- For nuclei heavier than iron (high $A$), the increasing Coulomb repulsion term $Z^2/A$ dominates, causing the $B/A$ curve to slowly decrease. This makes heavy nuclei less stable than medium-mass nuclei.\n\n**Part 4: Relation to Accelerator-Driven Transmutation**\n\nThe position of $^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}$ at the peak of the binding energy curve is fundamental to the energetics of nuclear reactions, including those in accelerator-driven systems (ADS).\n- The primary goal of ADS for nuclear waste management is to transmute long-lived radioactive isotopes (e.g., minor actinides and certain fission products) into stable or short-lived nuclides. These waste isotopes are heavy nuclei, located far to the right of the iron peak on the $B/A$ curve, meaning they are significantly less stable (less tightly bound) than nuclides in the iron region.\n- In an ADS, a particle accelerator generates a beam of high-energy particles (e.g., protons), which strikes a heavy metal target (like lead or bismuth) to produce a shower of high-energy neutrons via spallation. These neutrons then bombard the nuclear waste material.\n- When a neutron is captured by or fissions a heavy waste nucleus, the transmutation process generally produces lighter nuclei (fission fragments). These product nuclei tend to be closer to the $A \\approx 56$ peak of the binding energy curve.\n- According to the curve, moving from a region of low $B/A$ (heavy nuclei) to a region of higher $B/A$ (medium-mass nuclei) results in a net release of energy. The total mass of the final products is less than the total mass of the initial reactants, and this mass difference is converted into kinetic energy of the products.\n- Therefore, the transmutation of heavy nuclear waste is an *exothermic* process. The accelerator provides the necessary activation energy in the form of energetic neutrons to initiate and sustain these reactions at a controlled rate, but the overall energetics are favorable due to the fundamental nuclear physics encapsulated by the binding energy curve. The transmutation process effectively \"incinerates\" the waste by converting it into more stable forms, releasing energy in the process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.790}$$", "id": "2948366"}, {"introduction": "The mass defect in a nuclear reaction is not merely an accounting discrepancy; it is converted into tangible kinetic energy, as described by $E=mc^2$.
