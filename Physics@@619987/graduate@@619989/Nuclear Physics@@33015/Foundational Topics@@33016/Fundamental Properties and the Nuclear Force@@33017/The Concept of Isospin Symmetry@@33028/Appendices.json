The Fermi transition operator, which for $\\beta^+$ decay is the total isospin lowering operator $T_- = \\sum_{i=1}^{A} \\tau_-^{(i)}$, only connects states within the same isospin multiplet. Consequently, for a transition to be \"allowed\" by isospin symmetry, the total isospin quantum number $I$ of the nucleus must not change ($\\Delta I = 0$).\n\nHowever, the electromagnetic (Coulomb) interaction does not respect isospin symmetry and can induce mixing between nuclear states of different total isospin $I$.

Since the initial and final states have different total isospin values ($I_p=0$ and $I_d=1$), they are orthogonal with respect to any operator that is a scalar in isospin space (like $T_-$). Therefore, this matrix element is zero due to the isospin selection rule $\\Delta I=0$.\n$$\\langle I=1, I_3=-1 | T_- | I=0, I_3=0 \\rangle = 0$$\nSo, the first term vanishes.\n\n**Term 2: $\\alpha \\langle φ_d | T_- | IAS_d \\rangle$**\nThis term represents the transition from the admixed component of the parent state to the daughter state.\n-   Initial state (for the operator): $|IAS_d\\rangle = |I=1, I_3=0\\rangle$.\n-   Final state: $|φ_d\\rangle = |I=1, I_3=-1\\rangle$.\n\nHere, the total isospin of the initial and final states is the same ($I=1$), so the transition is allowed.
