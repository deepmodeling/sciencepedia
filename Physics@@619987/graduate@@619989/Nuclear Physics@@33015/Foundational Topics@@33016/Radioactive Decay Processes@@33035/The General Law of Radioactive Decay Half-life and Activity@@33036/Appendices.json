This exercise [@problem_id:423858] challenges you to analyze a system that reaches a periodic steady state rather than a simple static equilibrium. You will discover an elegant principle for finding the time-averaged activity by equating the average production and decay rates over a full cycle.", "problem": "A sample of a stable nuclide is irradiated by a source of particles, causing it to transform into a radioactive isotope X. The production of X occurs at a constant rate $R$ whenever the source is active. The source operates in a periodic pulsed mode: it is switched 'on' for a duration $T_{\\text{on}}$, and then switched 'off' for a duration $T_{\\text{off}}$. This on-off cycle repeats indefinitely. The radioactive isotope X decays with a known decay constant $\\lambda$.\n\nAfter a sufficiently long time, the system reaches a periodic steady state. In this state, the number of radioactive nuclei $N(t)$ at the start of any given 'on' pulse is identical to the number at the start of the subsequent 'on' pulse.\n\nYour task is to determine the time-averaged activity of the sample, $\\langle A \\rangle$, over one full period $T = T_{\\text{on}} + T_{\\text{off}}$ once this periodic steady state has been established.", "solution": "Let $N(t)$ be the number of radioactive nuclei of isotope X at time $t$. The activity of the sample at time $t$ is given by $A(t) = \\lambda N(t)$.\n\nThe rate of change of the number of nuclei is described by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = P(t) - \\lambda N(t)\n$$\nwhere $P(t)$ is the production rate of the isotope X. According to the problem description, $P(t)$ is a periodic function of time with period $T = T_{\\text{on}} + T_{\\text{off}}$. Within a single cycle, which we can define to start at $t=0$, the production rate is:\n$$\nP(t) = \n\\begin{cases} \nR & \\text{for } 0 \\le t < T_{\\text{on}} \\\\\n0 & \\text{for } T_{\\text{on}} \\le t < T \n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the system reaches a periodic steady state. This is a crucial condition. It implies that the number of nuclei at the end of a full cycle is equal to the number of nuclei at the beginning of that cycle. Let's denote the number of nuclei at the beginning of a cycle (at $t=0$) as $N_0$. Then, in the steady state, the number of nuclei at the end of the cycle (at $t=T$) must be the same:\n$$\nN(T) = N(0) = N_0\n$$\nThis means that the net change in the number of nuclei over one complete cycle is zero:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{\\text{cycle}} = N(T) - N(0) = 0\n$$\n\nWe can also express this net change by integrating the governing differential equation over one full period $T$:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{\\text{cycle}} = \\int_0^T \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} dt = \\int_0^T \\left( P(t) - \\lambda N(t) \\right) dt\n$$\nSetting $\\Delta N_{\\text{cycle}} = 0$ for the steady state, we get:\n$$\n\\int_0^T P(t) dt - \\int_0^T \\lambda N(t) dt = 0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\int_0^T P(t) dt = \\int_0^T \\lambda N(t) dt\n$$\nThis equation has a clear physical interpretation: in steady state, the total number of nuclei produced during one cycle must equal the total number of nuclei that decay during that same cycle.\n\nLet's evaluate the left-hand side, which is the total number of nuclei produced in one cycle:\n$$\n\\int_0^T P(t) dt = \\int_0^{T_{\\text{on}}} R \\, dt + \\int_{T_{\\text{on}}}^T 0 \\, dt = R \\cdot T_{\\text{on}}\n$$\nThe right-hand side involves the integral of the instantaneous activity $A(t) = \\lambda N(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_0^T \\lambda N(t) dt = \\int_0^T A(t) dt\n$$\nEquating the two sides gives:\n$$\nR T_{\\text{on}} = \\int_0^T A(t) dt\n$$\n\nThe quantity we need to find is the time-averaged activity, $\\langle A \\rangle$, over one period $T$. This is defined as:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T A(t) dt\n$$\nSubstituting the result from our steady-state analysis:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{R T_{\\text{on}}}{T}\n$$\nFinally, substituting $T = T_{\\text{on}} + T_{\\text{off}}$, we obtain the final expression for the average activity:\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle = \\frac{R T_{\\text{on}}}{T_{\\text{on}} + T_{\\text{off}}}\n$$\nThis result is physically intuitive: the average activity (decay rate) in the steady state must equal the average production rate.
