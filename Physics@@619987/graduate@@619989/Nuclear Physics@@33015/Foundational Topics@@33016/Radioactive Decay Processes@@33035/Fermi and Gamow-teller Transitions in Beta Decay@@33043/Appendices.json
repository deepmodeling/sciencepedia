Allowed transitions are the fastest and are described by an operator that is effectively constant over the nuclear volume (the long-wavelength approximation). For Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions, the operator involves the nucleon spin. In the single-particle shell model, the operator for an allowed GT transition is proportional to the Pauli spin operator, $\\vec{\\sigma}$. This operator is a rank-1 tensor in spin space, but a scalar (rank-0 tensor) in ordinary coordinate space. As a consequence, it cannot change the orbital angular momentum ($L$) of the nucleon. Transitions where $\\Delta L \\neq 0$ are thus known as \"$l$-forbidden\" in the context of allowed decay theory; they can only proceed via higher-order terms that are not spatially constant, and are therefore significantly suppressed.\n\nYour task is to demonstrate this selection rule, $\\Delta L = 0$, by direct calculation for a specific case.
