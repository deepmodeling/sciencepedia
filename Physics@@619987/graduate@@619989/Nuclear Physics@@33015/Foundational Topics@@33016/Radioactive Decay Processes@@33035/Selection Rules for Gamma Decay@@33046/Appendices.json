The alpha decay populates the low-lying states of the daughter nucleus. The daughter nucleus possesses a ground-state rotational band, built on the $K=0$ intrinsic state, with levels denoted as $0_g^+, 2_g^+, 4_g^+, \\dots$. It also has a $\\gamma$-vibrational band built on a $K=2$ intrinsic state, with the band-head being the $2_\\gamma^+$ state.\n\nThe alpha decay from the parent nucleus populates the $4_g^+$ and $2_g^+$ states of the daughter's ground-state band. The relative rates of population for these states are proportional to constants $A_4$ and $A_2$, respectively. It is assumed that the alpha decay does not significantly populate any other states that could feed the levels of interest.\n\nThe excited states of the daughter nucleus decay via gamma-ray emission. The decay scheme is as follows:\n1.  The $4_g^+$ state decays via electric quadrupole (E2) transitions to both the $2_g^+$ state and the $2_\\gamma^+$ state. The ratio of the number of emitted gamma photons for these two decay branches is given by $b = \\frac{N_\\gamma(4_g^+ \\to 2_\\gamma^+)}{N_\\gamma(4_g^+ \\to 2_g^+)}$.\n2.  The $2_\\gamma^+$ state is assumed to decay exclusively to the $2_g^+$ state.\n3.  The $2_g^+$ state is assumed to decay exclusively to the $0_g^+$ ground state.\n4.  Internal conversion processes can be neglected for all transitions.\n\nAssuming the system is in a steady state (i.e., the population of each excited state is constant over time), calculate the ratio of the gamma-ray intensities $R = \\frac{I(4_g^+ \\to 2_g^+)}{I(2_g^+ \\to 0_g^+)}$ in terms of the given parameters $A_2$, $A_4$, and $b$.", "solution": "Let $P_\\alpha(J^\\pi)$ be the rate at which the state with spin-parity $J^\\pi$ is populated by the alpha decay of the parent nucleus.
