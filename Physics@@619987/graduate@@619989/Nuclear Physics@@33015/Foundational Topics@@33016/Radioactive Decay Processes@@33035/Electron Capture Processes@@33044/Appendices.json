This process converts a nuclear proton into a neutron and results in the emission of an electron neutrino.\n\nIn the so-called \"allowed approximation,\" which is valid for many transitions, the capture rate $\\lambda_i$ for an electron from a specific atomic state 'i' is proportional to the probability of finding that electron at the location of the nucleus, $|\\psi_i(0)|^2$, and the phase space available to the emitted neutrino. The neutrino energy is the total energy released in the nuclear transition (the Q-value, $Q$) minus the binding energy of the captured electron, $B_i$. Specifically, the capture rate follows the relation:\n$$\n\\lambda_i \\propto |\\psi_i(0)|^2 (Q - B_i)^2\n$$\nNote that for states with non-zero orbital angular momentum ($l > 0$), the wavefunction vanishes at the origin, i.e., $|\\psi_i(0)|^2=0$, so their contribution to the capture rate is negligible in this approximation. Therefore, K-capture refers to the capture of a $1s$ electron, and L-capture refers to the capture of a $2s$ electron.\n\nConsider an atom with nuclear charge $Z$ undergoing electron capture.

By momentum conservation, the daughter nucleus and the neutrino recoil back-to-back: $\\vec{p}_D + \\vec{p}_\\nu = 0$, so $\\hat{p}_D = -\\hat{p}_\\nu$. Let's choose the quantization axis (the $z$-axis) to be along the direction of the neutrino's momentum, $\\hat{z} = \\hat{p}_\\nu$. The recoil direction of the daughter nucleus is then $-\\hat{z}$.\n\nThe spin projection of the daughter nucleus along its direction of motion is $\\vec{J}_D \\cdot \\hat{p}_D = \\vec{J}_D \\cdot (-\\hat{z}) = -J_{D,z}$.\nThe longitudinal polarization is therefore:\n$$\nP_L = \\frac{\\langle -J_{D,z} \\rangle}{J_D} = -\\frac{1}{J_D} \\langle J_{D,z} \\rangle\n$$\nWe need to calculate the expectation value of the $z$-component of the daughter nucleus's spin, $\\langle J_{D,z} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Transition Rates and Selection Rules**\n\nFor an allowed Gamow-Teller transition, the nuclear operator is a vector operator (rank 1 tensor), effectively the spin operator $\\vec{\\sigma}$. The leptons also carry away one unit of angular momentum, $S_{lep}=1$.\n\nThe transition amplitude involves the matrix element of the weak Hamiltonian, which factorizes into a nuclear part and a leptonic part. The crucial part for this problem is the leptonic weak current, which for a Gamow-Teller transition is proportional to $\\bar{u}_\\nu \\boldsymbol{\\gamma} (1-\\gamma_5) u_e$. In the non-relativistic limit for the captured electron, this simplifies to a term proportional to $\\chi_\\nu^\\dagger \\vec{\\sigma} \\chi_e$, where $\\chi$ are the Pauli spinors.\n\nThe transition rate depends on the initial nuclear state $(J, M_J)$, the initial electron spin state $m_e$, and the final nuclear state $(J_D, M_D)$. Let us analyze the spin selection rules imposed by the leptonic part. We use spherical tensor components $\\sigma_q$ of the operator $\\vec{\\sigma}$.\nThe lepton matrix element is $\\langle \\nu | \\sigma_q | e \\rangle$.\nThe neutrino is left-handed, so its spin projection along its momentum (our $z$-axis) is $m_\\nu = -1/2$. Its spinor is $|\\downarrow\\rangle_\\nu$. The K-electron has spin $s_e=1/2$. Its spin state can be $m_e=1/2$ ($|\\uparrow\\rangle_e$) or $m_e=-1/2$ ($|\\downarrow\\rangle_e$) along the $z$-axis. The initial K-shell is unpolarized, so both electron spin states are equally probable.\n\nThe change in the magnetic quantum number of the nucleus, $q = M_D - M_J$, is determined by the angular momentum carried away by the leptons, which is dictated by the value of $q$ for which the lepton matrix element $\\langle \\downarrow_\\nu | \\sigma_q | m_e \\rangle$ is non-zero.\n\n*   **Case 1: Electron spin $m_e = +1/2$ ($|\\uparrow\\rangle_e$).**\n    The only non-zero matrix element is for $q=-1$:\n    $\\langle \\downarrow_\\nu | \\sigma_{-1} | \\uparrow_e \\rangle = \\langle \\downarrow_\\nu | \\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{-} | \\uparrow_e \\rangle = \\sqrt{2}$. The rate contribution is proportional to $|\\sqrt{2}|^2=2$.\n    For this channel, $M_D = M_J - 1$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Electron spin $m_e = -1/2$ ($|\\downarrow\\rangle_e$).**\n    The only non-zero matrix element is for $q=0$:\n    $\\langle \\downarrow_\\nu | \\sigma_0 | \\downarrow_e \\rangle = \\langle \\downarrow_\\nu | \\sigma_z | \\downarrow_e \\rangle = -1$. The rate contribution is proportional to $|-1|^2=1$.\n    For this channel, $M_D = M_J$.\n\nSo, we have two distinct channels for the capture process, with relative rates $W_{q=-1}:W_{q=0} = 2:1$.\n\n3.  **Calculation of $\\langle J_{D,z} \\rangle$**\n\nThe expectation value $\\langle J_{D,z} \\rangle$ is the average over all possible transitions, weighted by their rates. Since the parent nucleus is unpolarized, we average over the initial $2J+1$ magnetic substates $M_J$.\n$$\n\\langle J_{D,z} \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{M_J} \\left[ W_{q=-1} \\cdot M_{D,1} \\cdot P_1(M_J) + W_{q=0} \\cdot M_{D,2} \\cdot P_2(M_J) \\right]}{\\sum_{M_J} \\left[ W_{q=-1} \\cdot P_1(M_J) + W_{q=0} \\cdot P_2(M_J) \\right]}\n$$\nwhere $P_1(M_J)$ and $P_2(M_J)$ are the nuclear transition probabilities for the two channels, and $M_{D,1}, M_{D,2}$ are the corresponding final magnetic quantum numbers.\n\nFrom the Wigner-Eckart theorem, the nuclear transition probability is proportional to the square of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient: $P(J, M_J \\to J_D, M_D) \\propto |C(J, 1, J_D; M_J, q, M_D)|^2$.\nIn our case, $J_D = J-1$. Let's denote the parent spin as $J_P$ for clarity in the formulas.\n*   For channel 1 ($q=-1$): $M_D = M_{J_P}-1$.
