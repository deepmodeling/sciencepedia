The factor is given by the WKB integral:\n$$\nG = \\frac{\\sqrt{2m}}{\\hbar} \\int_{r_{in}}^{r_{out}} \\sqrt{V(r) - E} \\, dr\n$$\nHere, $m$ and $E$ are the mass and energy of the alpha particle, and $r_{in}, r_{out}$ are the classical turning points of the potential $V(r)$.\n\nA simple model for the potential combines the repulsive Coulomb potential of the daughter nucleus, $V_C(r) = k_C/r$, with an attractive nuclear potential. The standard model approximates the nuclear potential as a square well of depth $V_0$ and radius $R$. The total potential is $V_{std}(r) = -V_0$ for $r \\le R$ and $V_{std}(r) = V_C(r)$ for $r > R$. For this potential, the alpha particle is considered to tunnel from $r_{in}=R$ to the outer turning point $r_{out}=k_C/E$.\n\nA more realistic nuclear potential is the Woods-Saxon potential, $V_{WS}(r) = -\\frac{V_0}{1 + \\exp((r-R)/a)}$, where $a$ is the diffuseness parameter.

Treat the difference between the two potentials in the tunneling region as a small perturbation. You may assume that the nuclear diffuseness $a$ is much smaller than both the nuclear radius $R$ and the outer turning point $r_{out}$. This allows for an approximation where the slowly varying Coulomb-related terms in the integrand can be treated as constant over the narrow range near $r=R$ where the Woods-Saxon potential significantly contributes.
