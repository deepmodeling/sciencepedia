This exercise challenges you to connect these different experimental observables through their common origin in the binding energy landscape.

For alpha decay, where a parent nucleus $(A, Z)$ decays into a daughter nucleus $(A-4, Z-2)$ and an alpha particle ($^4\\text{He}$), the Q-value is given by $Q_\\alpha = (m_{parent} - m_{daughter} - m_{\\alpha})c^2$, where $m$ is the nuclear mass and $c$ is the speed of light. In terms of binding energies $B$, this is equivalent to $Q_\\alpha = B_{daughter} + B_{\\alpha} - B_{parent}$.\n\nAnother important quantity is the separation energy. The two-neutron separation energy, $S_{2n}$, for a nucleus $(A, Z)$ is the minimum energy required to remove two neutrons from it. This is given by $S_{2n} = (m(A-2, Z) + 2m_n - m(A, Z))c^2$, where $m_n$ is the mass of a neutron.
