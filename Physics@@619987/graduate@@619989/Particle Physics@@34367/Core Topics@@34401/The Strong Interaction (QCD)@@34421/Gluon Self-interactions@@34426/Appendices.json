At one-loop, these corrections come from two diagrams: an \"abelian-like\" diagram and a \"non-abelian\" diagram which involves the three-gluon self-interaction vertex. This problem focuses exclusively on the non-abelian contribution.\n\nConsider a massless quark field $\\psi$ interacting with a gluon field $A_\\mu^a$ within an $SU(N)$ gauge theory. The quark-gluon vertex is given at tree-level by $V_0^{\\mu,a} = -ig_s \\gamma^\\mu T^a$, where $g_s$ is the strong coupling constant and $T^a$ are the generators of the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$.\n\nThe one-loop non-abelian correction to this vertex, $\\Gamma_{NA}^{\\mu,a}(p', p)$, is described by the Feynman diagram where the external gluon (momentum $q=p'-p$, color $a$, index $\\mu$) connects to a three-gluon vertex, which in turn connects to two internal gluons that are emitted and absorbed by the quark line.\n\nThe UV divergence of this diagram contributes to the vertex renormalization constant $Z_1$. In dimensional regularization ($d=4-\\epsilon$), the counterterm $\\delta_1$ is defined via $Z_1 = 1 - \\delta_1$, and is chosen to cancel the $1/\\epsilon$ pole of the loop correction. The anomalous dimension of the quark field, $\\gamma_\\psi$, is related to the quark wave function renormalization constant $Z_2 = 1 - \\delta_2$. In a power series expansion in the strong coupling $\\alpha_s=g_s^2/(4\\pi)$, the anomalous dimension is $\\gamma_\\psi = \\gamma_\\psi^{(1)} \\frac{\\alpha_s}{4\\pi} + \\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$.
