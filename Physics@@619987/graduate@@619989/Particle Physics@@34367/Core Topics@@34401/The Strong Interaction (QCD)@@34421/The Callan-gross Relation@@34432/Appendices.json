The interaction is mediated by a virtual photon with four-momentum $q$. The structure of the hadron is encoded in the hadronic tensor $W^{\\mu\\nu}$, which can be decomposed in terms of structure functions. For a spin-unpolarized hadron with four-momentum $P$ and mass $M$, the symmetric part of the hadronic tensor has the general form:\n$$\nW^{\\mu\\nu}(P, q) = \\left(-g^{\\mu\\nu} + \\frac{q^\\mu q^\\nu}{q^2}\\right) W_1(x, Q^2) + \\frac{1}{M^2}\\left(P^\\mu - \\frac{P \\cdot q}{q^2}q^\\mu\\right)\\left(P^\\nu - \\frac{P \\cdot q}{q^2}q^\\nu\\right) W_2(x, Q^2)\n$$\nHere, $Q^2 = -q^2$ is the momentum transfer squared, and $x = Q^2 / (2 P \\cdot q)$ is the Bjorken scaling variable. The structure functions $W_1$ and $W_2$ parametrize the response of the hadron to the photon probe. In the Bjorken limit ($Q^2, P \\cdot q \\to \\infty$ with $x$ fixed), these functions exhibit scaling, becoming functions of $x$ alone: $F_1(x) = \\lim W_1(x, Q^2)$ and $F_2(x) = \\lim \\frac{P\\cdot q}{M^2} W_2(x, Q^2)$. The Callan-Gross relation, $2x F_1(x) = F_2(x)$, observed experimentally, was crucial evidence for spin-1/2 quark partons.\n\nIn this problem, we will explore a hypothetical scenario where the fundamental constituents of a hadron are spin-0 particles (scalar partons). We model the hadron itself as a single elementary spin-0 particle of mass $M$ and charge $e_f$. The electromagnetic interaction for a scalar particle is described by a current whose matrix element between an initial state of momentum $P$ and a final state of momentum $P'$ is proportional to $(P+P')^\\mu$.\n\nIn elastic scattering of the virtual photon off this scalar target, the final state is a single particle, so its momentum is fixed by conservation to be $P' = P+q$. Consequently, the hadronic tensor for this process is given by\n$$\nW^{\\mu\\nu} = \\mathcal{K}(x, Q^2) \\cdot (2P+q)^\\mu (2P+q)^\\nu\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{K}(x, Q^2)$ is a scalar function that contains factors from the coupling, normalization, and a delta function enforcing the kinematics of elastic scattering, specifically that the final particle is on its mass shell, $(P+q)^2=M^2$, which implies $x=1$.\n\nYour task is to determine the structure function $F_1(x)$ for this spin-0 parton model. To do this, you only need to analyze the tensor structure. Find the value of $W_1$ by decomposing the tensor part $(2P+q)^\\mu (2P+q)^\\nu$ according to the general form of $W^{\\mu\\nu}$ given above. What is the resulting value of the structure function $F_1(x)$?", "solution": "The structure function $F_1(x)$ (and its unscaled precursor $W_1$) is associated with the absorption of a transversely polarized virtual photon. A fundamental principle of physics is the conservation of angular momentum.\n\n1.  **Angular Momentum Conservation:**\n    A virtual photon, like a real photon, carries one unit of angular momentum ($J=1$). A spin-0 particle, by definition, has zero intrinsic angular momentum ($S=0$). In deep inelastic scattering, the virtual photon is absorbed by the parton. If the initial parton has spin 0 and the final parton (after absorbing the photon) also has spin 0, the process is:\n    $$ \\text{Photon}(J=1) + \\text{Parton}_{\\text{initial}}(S=0) \\to \\text{Parton}_{\\text{final}}(S=0) $$\n    For angular momentum to be conserved, the initial total angular momentum must equal the final total angular momentum. In the parton model frame (where orbital angular momentum can be neglected), this means the spin must be conserved. The initial state has a total spin of 1, while the final state has a total spin of 0. This is a forbidden transition.\n\n2.  **Role of Polarization:**\n    This conservation rule applies specifically to the absorption of a **transverse** photon, which is the type of photon that carries the spin-1 projection. A spin-0 particle cannot flip its spin (as it has none to flip), which is a necessary part of absorbing a transverse photon in the simplest interaction. Therefore, the cross-section for absorbing a transverse photon, $\\sigma_T$, must be zero.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for $F_1(x)$:**\n    The structure function $F_1(x)$ is directly proportional to the transverse cross-section $\\sigma_T$. Since $\\sigma_T=0$ for a spin-0 target in this model, it follows that the structure function $F_1(x)$ must also be zero.\n    $$ F_1(x) = 0 $$\n    This represents a maximal violation of the Callan-Gross relation and is in stark contrast to the experimental data where $F_1(x)$ is large, providing powerful evidence against scalar partons and for spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ quarks.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "202049"}, {"introduction": "The \"naive\" parton model provides a powerful, yet idealized, picture where quarks are massless.
