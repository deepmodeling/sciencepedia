The Bjorken scaling variable $x$ represents the fraction of the hadron's longitudinal momentum carried by the struck parton. For a spin-$1/2$ hadron like the proton, we can define both unpolarized and polarized PDFs.\n\nThe unpolarized PDF for a quark of flavor $q$ is denoted by $q(x)$. The helicity distribution, $\\Delta q(x)$, is defined as the difference between the PDF for quarks with helicity aligned with the proton's helicity ($q^{\\uparrow}(x)$) and the PDF for quarks with helicity anti-aligned ($q^{\\downarrow}(x)$):\n$$\n\\Delta q(x) = q^{\\uparrow}(x) - q^{\\downarrow}(x)\n$$\nThe unpolarized PDF is the sum $q(x) = q^{\\uparrow}(x) + q^{\\downarrow}(x)$.\n\nIn the limit $x \\to 1$, the behavior of these distributions can be predicted by spectator quark counting rules. The rule for the unpolarized PDF states that the leading power-law behavior is governed by the minimum number of spectator quarks, $n_s$, in the hadron's valence Fock state:\n$$\nq(x) \\sim (1-x)^{2n_s - 1} \\quad \\text{as} \\quad x \\to 1\n$$\nFor the polarized case, a key principle derived from helicity conservation in perturbative QCD is that in the $x \\to 1$ limit, the struck quark must have the same helicity as the parent hadron. This implies that for a proton with positive helicity, the distribution $q^{\\uparrow}(x)$ is the dominant component, while $q^{\\downarrow}(x)$ is suppressed by at least one additional power of $(1-x)$.\n\nUsing these principles, determine the leading power-law exponent $n$ for the helicity distribution of a down quark, $\\Delta d(x)$, inside a proton, such that $\\Delta d(x) \\sim (1-x)^n$ as $x \\to 1$.", "solution": "1.

At leading order in the strong coupling constant, the structure function $g_1(x, Q^2)$ is a pure twist-2 quantity. However, $g_2(x, Q^2)$ is more complex and receives contributions from both twist-2 and twist-3 operators.
