The process can be described by the reaction $e(k) + P(P) \\to e'(k') + X$, where $k, P, k'$ are the four-momenta of the initial electron, proton, and final electron, respectively, and $X$ represents the hadronic final state.\n\nThe key kinematic variables are:\n- The momentum transfer squared: $Q^2 = -q^2 = -(k-k')^2 > 0$.\n- The Bjorken scaling variable: $x = \\frac{Q^2}{2P \\cdot q}$.\n- The inelasticity parameter: $y = \\frac{P \\cdot q}{P \\cdot k}$.\n- The total lepton-proton center-of-mass energy squared: $s = (k+P)^2$.\n\nIn the high-energy limit, where all masses ($m_e, M_P, m_q$) can be neglected, these variables are related by $Q^2 \\approx sxy$.\n\nThe naive parton model interprets this process as the elastic scattering of the electron off a quasi-free, point-like constituent of the proton, a quark. The fundamental subprocess is $e(k) + q(p) \\to e(k') + q(p')$, where the initial quark carries a fraction $x$ of the proton's momentum, $p=xP$.\n\nConsider this partonic subprocess in the **parton-lepton center-of-mass frame**, which is the frame where the total three-momentum of the initial electron and the struck quark is zero. Let $\\hat{\\theta}_q$ be the scattering angle of the quark in this frame (i.e., the angle between the final three-momentum $\\vec{p}'$ and the initial three-momentum $\\vec{p}$).\n\nCalculate the cosine of the quark scattering angle, $\\cos(\\hat{\\theta}_q)$, as a function of the DIS kinematic variables $x$ and $y$.", "solution": "**Solution**\n\nWe are asked to find the cosine of the quark scattering angle, $\\cos(\\hat{\\theta}_q)$, in the parton-lepton center-of-mass (CM) frame for the subprocess $e(k) + q(p) \\to e(k') + q(p')$. We work in the high-energy limit where the masses of the electron, proton, and quark are negligible.\n\nThe calculation is most conveniently performed using Mandelstam variables for the partonic subprocess. Let's define them:\n- $\\hat{s} = (k+p)^2$\n- $\\hat{t} = (k-k')^2 = q^2 = -Q^2$\n- $\\hat{u} = (p-k')^2$\n\nSince we assume all particles are massless, the sum of the Mandelstam variables is zero:\n$$\n\\hat{s} + \\hat{t} + \\hat{u} = m_e^2 + m_q^2 + m_e^2 + m_q^2 \\approx 0\n$$\n\nFirst, we relate the partonic variable $\\hat{s}$ to the global DIS variables.

In this frame, the total energy is $\\sqrt{\\hat{s}}$. Since the electron and quark are massless, they each have energy $E_{cm} = \\sqrt{\\hat{s}}/2$.\nLet the initial electron momentum be $\\vec{k}_{cm}$ and the final electron momentum be $\\vec{k}'_{cm}$. Their magnitudes are $|\\vec{k}_{cm}| = |\\vec{k}'_{cm}| = \\sqrt{\\hat{s}}/2$. The angle between them is the electron scattering angle $\\hat{\\theta}_e$.\nBy momentum conservation in the CM frame, $\\vec{p}_{cm} = -\\vec{k}_{cm}$ and $\\vec{p}'_{cm} = -\\vec{k}'_{cm}$.
