Quarks are fundamental fermions with spin $1/2$. They also carry a quantum number called \"color\" (which can be red, green, or blue). A fundamental principle of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), known as color confinement, dictates that all observable free particles must be \"color singlets,\" meaning they have no net color charge.\n\nThe total wavefunction of a multi-quark system, $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$, must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that the total wavefunction for a system of identical fermions must be totally antisymmetric under the exchange of any two particles. The total wavefunction can be expressed as a product of wavefunctions for each degree of freedom:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\Psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{spin}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{color}}\n$$\nThe symmetry of the total wavefunction under particle exchange is the product of the symmetries of its constituent parts.\n\nConsider a hypothetical dibaryon (a stable 6-quark state) composed of six **identical** quarks (i.e., they all have the same flavor and mass). The system is in its quantum mechanical ground state. You are given the following information based on standard assumptions in the quark model:\n\n1.  In the ground state, all six quarks occupy the same lowest-energy spatial orbital (an s-wave state). A multi-particle state where all constituents occupy the same single-particle spatial state is **totally symmetric** under the exchange of any two particles.\n2.  To satisfy color confinement, the 6-quark system forms a color singlet state. For a 6-quark system, the color singlet wavefunction is **totally antisymmetric** under the exchange of any two quarks.\n\nBased on these principles, what is the total spin, $J$, of this ground-state dibaryon?", "solution": "1.  The total wavefunction for this system of identical fermions must be antisymmetric:\n    $$ \\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\Psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{spin}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{color}} $$\n2.  We are given that $\\Psi_{\\text{spatial}}$ is totally symmetric and $\\Psi_{\\text{color}}$ is totally antisymmetric.\n3.  For the product $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$ to be antisymmetric, the spin wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{spin}}$ must be totally symmetric.

For six spin-1/2 particles, the totally symmetric spin state corresponds to the maximum possible total spin, where all individual spins are aligned:\n    $$ S_{\\text{max}} = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3 $$\n5.

In its ground state, it has a spatially symmetric S-wave wavefunction and a total spin of $J=S=3/2$. Due to its composition, its flavor wavefunction is also symmetric. Consequently, its spin wavefunction must be symmetric under the interchange of any two quarks.\n\nThe magnetic octupole moment, $\\mathcal{M}_3$, of a baryon is a measure of the non-spherical distribution of its magnetization.
