The interference between these two exchange processes gives rise to parity-violating effects. One observable consequence is the structure function $F_3^{\\gamma Z}(x, Q^2)$, where $x$ is the Bjorken scaling variable and $Q^2$ is the momentum transfer squared.\n\nIn the naive quark-parton model (QPM), this structure function is independent of $Q^2$ and can be expressed in terms of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton. For a proton target, the expression is:\n$$ F_3^{\\gamma Z}(x) = 2 \\sum_{f} e_f g_A^f [q_f(x) - \\bar{q}_f(x)] $$\nHere, the sum runs over all active quark flavors $f$.
