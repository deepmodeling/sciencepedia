This thought-provoking exercise challenges you to explore a hypothetical universe where quarks are bosons instead of fermions. By rebuilding the baryon spectrum under this new rule, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how the Pauli exclusion principle, in concert with color, spin, and flavor symmetries, dictates the very existence and structure of the baryons we observe in our own universe [@problem_id:171135].", "problem": "**Problem: Ground-State Baryons with Bosonic Quarks**\n\nIn the Standard Model of particle physics, baryons are composite particles made of three quarks ($qqq$). The theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) dictates that any physically observable particle must be a color singlet. For a three-quark state, the color part of the wavefunction, $\\Psi_{\\text{color}}$, is required to be totally antisymmetric under the exchange of any two quarks.\n\nThe three lightest quark flavors—up ($u$), down ($d$), and strange ($s$)—are treated as a basis for the fundamental representation $\\mathbf{3}$ of an approximate SU(3) flavor symmetry. Quarks are also spin-1/2 particles, transforming in the fundamental representation $\\mathbf{2}$ of SU(2) spin symmetry. For ground-state baryons, the quarks are in a state of zero relative orbital angular momentum ($L=0$), meaning the spatial part of the wavefunction, $\\Psi_{\\text{space}}$, is totally symmetric.\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical universe which is identical to our own in all respects, except for one crucial difference: **quarks are spin-1/2 bosons, not fermions.**\n\nAccording to quantum statistics, the total wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\Psi_{\\text{space}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{spin}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{flavor}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{color}}$ for a system of identical bosons must be totally symmetric under particle exchange.\n\nGiven these premises, determine all possible ground-state baryon multiplets, specified by their SU(3) flavor representation and total spin $S$. Then, calculate the total number of distinct quantum states corresponding to all possible ground-state baryons in this hypothetical universe.", "solution": "**1. Overall Symmetry Requirement**\n\nThe total wavefunction for a system of three identical bosonic quarks must be totally symmetric under the permutation of any two quarks. The total wavefunction is given by the tensor product:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\Psi_{\\text{space}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{spin}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{flavor}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{color}}\n$$\nLet's analyze the permutation symmetry of each component:\n*   $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$: Must be **Symmetric (S)** because quarks are bosons.\n*   $\\Psi_{\\text{space}}$: For the ground state ($L=0$), it is **Symmetric (S)**.\n*   $\\Psi_{\\text{color}}$: To form a baryon (a color singlet state from three quarks), it must be **Antisymmetric (A)**.\n\nThe overall symmetry is the product of the symmetries of the individual parts. Let $\\Psi_{\\text{SF}} = \\Psi_{\\text{spin}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{flavor}}$ be the combined spin-flavor wavefunction.\n$$\n(\\text{Symmetry of } \\Psi_{\\text{total}}) = (\\text{Symmetry of } \\Psi_{\\text{space}}) \\otimes (\\text{Symmetry of } \\Psi_{\\text{SF}}) \\otimes (\\text{Symmetry of } \\Psi_{\\text{color}})\n$$\n$$\nS = S \\otimes (\\text{Symmetry of } \\Psi_{\\text{SF}}) \\otimes A\n$$\nFor this equation to hold, the combined spin-flavor wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{SF}}$ must be **Antisymmetric (A)**. This is because $S \\otimes A = A$, and $A \\otimes A = S$.\n\n**2. Decomposition of SU(3) Flavor States**\n\nWe need to find the permutation symmetry properties of the representations arising from the tensor product of three fundamental flavor representations, $\\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{3}$. Using the methodology of Young Tableaux or direct product decomposition, we find:\n$$\n\\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{3} \\otimes \\mathbf{3} = \\mathbf{10}_S \\oplus \\mathbf{8}_M \\oplus \\mathbf{8}_M \\oplus \\mathbf{1}_A\n$$\nThe subscripts denote the symmetry under the permutation group $S_3$:\n*   Flavor-Symmetric (S): A decuplet $\\mathbf{10}$.\n*   Flavor-Mixed (M): Two octets $\\mathbf{8}$.\n*   Flavor-Antisymmetric (A): A singlet $\\mathbf{1}$.\n\n**3. Decomposition of SU(2) Spin States**\n\nSimilarly, we decompose the tensor product of three fundamental spin representations (spin-1/2), $\\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{2}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{2} \\otimes \\mathbf{2} = \\mathbf{4}_S \\oplus \\mathbf{2}_M \\oplus \\mathbf{2}_M\n$$\nThis corresponds to combining three spin-1/2 particles to get a total spin $S=3/2$ state and two distinct total spin $S=1/2$ states. The permutation symmetries are:\n*   Spin-Symmetric (S): A quartet $\\mathbf{4}$ with total spin $S=3/2$.\n*   Spin-Mixed (M): Two doublets $\\mathbf{2}$, each with total spin $S=1/2$.\n*   Spin-Antisymmetric (A): This representation is absent. It is impossible to form a totally antisymmetric spin state from three spin-1/2 particles.\n\n**4. Combining Flavor and Spin to Form Baryons**\n\nWe must combine the flavor and spin states to form a totally antisymmetric spin-flavor wavefunction, $(\\Psi_{\\text{SF}})_A$. The rules for combining permutation symmetries to obtain an overall antisymmetric state are:\n*   $S \\otimes A \\rightarrow A$\n*   $A \\otimes S \\rightarrow A$\n*   $M \\otimes M \\rightarrow A$ (The tensor product of two mixed representations contains an antisymmetric part).\n\nLet's examine the possible pairings:\n1.  **Flavor (S) $\\otimes$ Spin (A):** This would involve the flavor $\\mathbf{10}_S$. However, the spin-antisymmetric representation does not exist for three spin-1/2 particles. This combination is not possible.\n2.  **Flavor (A) $\\otimes$ Spin (S):** This pairs the flavor singlet $\\mathbf{1}_A$ with the spin quartet $\\mathbf{4}_S$.\n    *   Flavor Representation: $\\mathbf{1}$ (singlet)\n    *   Spin Representation: $\\mathbf{4}$ (total spin $S=3/2$)\n    *   This gives a valid baryon multiplet: a flavor singlet with spin $S=3/2$.\n3.  **Flavor (M) $\\otimes$ Spin (M):** This pairs a flavor octet $\\mathbf{8}_M$ with a spin doublet $\\mathbf{2}_M$. This combination yields an antisymmetric part.\n    *   Flavor Representation: $\\mathbf{8}$ (octet)\n    *   Spin Representation: $\\mathbf{2}$ (total spin $S=1/2$)\n    *   This gives another valid baryon multiplet: a flavor octet with spin $S=1/2$.\n\n**5. Calculating the Total Number of States**\n\nWe now sum the number of distinct quantum states for each allowed multiplet. The number of states in a multiplet is the product of the flavor dimension and the spin degeneracy ($2S+1$).\n\n*   **For the (Flavor $\\mathbf{1}$, Spin $3/2$) multiplet:**\n    *   Number of states = (dimension of $\\mathbf{1}$) $\\times$ ($2S+1$)\n    *   Number of states = $1 \\times (2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} + 1) = 1 \\times 4 = 4$.\n\n*   **For the (Flavor $\\mathbf{8}$, Spin $1/2$) multiplet:**\n    *   Number of states = (dimension of $\\mathbf{8}$) $\\times$ ($2S+1$)\n    *   Number of states = $8 \\times (2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1) = 8 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\nThe total number of ground-state baryon states is the sum of the states from these two multiplets.\n$$\n\\text{Total States} = 4 + 16 = 20\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{20}\n$$", "id": "171135"}, {"introduction": "Having established the symmetry rules for constructing baryons, we can now apply these ideas to predict their physical properties.
