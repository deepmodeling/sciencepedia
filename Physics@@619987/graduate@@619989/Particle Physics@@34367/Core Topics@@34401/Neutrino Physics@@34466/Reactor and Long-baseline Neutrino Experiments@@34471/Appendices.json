We can set up a coordinate system where the reactors are located at $(\\mp d/2, 0)$ and the detector's path is described by the line $y=H$. The position of the detector along this path is given by the coordinate $x$, so its location is $(x, H)$. For this problem, assume all detected neutrinos are mono-energetic with energy $E$.\n\nThe rate of neutrino detections is proportional to the incoherent sum of fluxes from each reactor, modulated by the respective survival probabilities. The flux from a point source scales as $1/L^2$, where $L$ is the distance to the source. Therefore, the detection rate as a function of detector position $x$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(x) \\propto \\frac{P(\\bar{\\nu}_e \\to \\bar{\\nu}_e; L_1(x), E)}{L_1(x)^2} + \\frac{P(\\bar{\\nu}_e \\to \\bar{\\nu}_e; L_2(x), E)}{L_2(x)^2}\n$$\nwhere $L_1(x)$ and $L_2(x)$ are the distances from the detector to the first and second reactor, respectively.\n\nThe superposition of the two neutrino signals creates an interference pattern.
