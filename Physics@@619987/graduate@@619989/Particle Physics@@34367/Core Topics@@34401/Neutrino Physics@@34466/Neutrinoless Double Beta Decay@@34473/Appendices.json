Many of these new physics scenarios, such as R-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetry, can be described at low energies by effective short-range operators.\n\nA key feature of these short-range mechanisms is the distinct energy distribution of the two emitted electrons. For certain operators, such as those arising from gluino exchange in some RPV-SUSY models, the two electrons are preferentially emitted in a relative P-wave state.
