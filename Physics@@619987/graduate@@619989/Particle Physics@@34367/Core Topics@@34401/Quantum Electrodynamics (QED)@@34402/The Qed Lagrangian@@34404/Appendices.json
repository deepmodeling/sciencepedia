This procedure introduces a dependence on a chosen renormalization scheme. Two of the most common schemes are the on-shell (OS) scheme and the modified minimal subtraction ($\\overline{\\text{MS}}$) scheme. Consequently, the definition of the renormalized electric charge depends on the scheme, leading to the on-shell charge, $e_{OS}$, and the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ charge, $e_{\\overline{MS}}(\\mu)$, which depends on a renormalization scale $\\mu$.\n\nThe connection between these schemes arises from the renormalization of the photon propagator, which is corrected by the vacuum polarization tensor $\\Pi^{\\mu\\nu}(q)$. Due to gauge invariance, this tensor has the form $\\Pi^{\\mu\\nu}(q) = (q^2 g^{\\mu\\nu} - q^{\\mu}q^{\\nu}) \\Pi(q^2)$.\n\nConsider QED with a single charged fermion of mass $m$.

The counterterm $\\delta_3$ is chosen according to the scheme rules to cancel divergences in the theory. The renormalized scalar function is $\\Pi_R(q^2) = \\Pi_0(q^2) + \\delta_3$.\n\nThe schemes are defined as follows:\n1.  **On-Shell (OS) Scheme:** The charge $e_{OS}$ is defined at zero momentum transfer. The renormalization condition requires the renormalized self-energy to vanish at $q^2=0$, i.e., $\\Pi_R^{OS}(q^2=0) = 0$. This fixes the counterterm $\\delta_3^{OS}$.\n2.  **$\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ Scheme:** The charge $e_{\\overline{MS}}(\\mu)$ is defined by subtracting only the universal divergent part of $\\Pi_0(q^2)$.
