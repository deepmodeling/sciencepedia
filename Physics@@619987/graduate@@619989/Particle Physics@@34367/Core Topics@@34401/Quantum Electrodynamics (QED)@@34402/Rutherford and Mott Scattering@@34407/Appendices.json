It does not account for spin or relativistic effects.\n\nFor the electron (a spin-$1/2$ particle):\nAs stated in Foundation 2, relativistic treatment via the Dirac equation is necessary. An electron moving in the static Coulomb E-field of the nucleus perceives, in its own rest frame, a magnetic field, $\\vec{B} \\propto \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{E}$. The interaction of the electron's intrinsic magnetic moment (due to its spin) with this effective magnetic field is a form of spin-orbit coupling. This interaction introduces spin-dependent terms into the scattering amplitude, including a \"spin-flip\" amplitude which is absent in the non-relativistic theory. For an unpolarized beam, one averages over initial spin states and sums over final spin states. The interference between the primary (spin-conserving) amplitude and the spin-flip amplitude modifies the cross-section. The result, known as the Mott cross-section, for a point nucleus and unpolarized beam is:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma_{\\text{Mott}}}{d\\Omega} = \\left(\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\Omega}\\right)_{\\text{Ruth}} \\left(1 - \\beta_e^2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)\\right)$$\nThis correction term, $1 - \\beta_e^2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$, encapsulates the lowest-order effect of the electron's spin in a relativistic context. At the given angle $\\theta = 60^\\circ$, we have $\\sin(\\theta/2) = \\sin(30^\\circ) = 1/2$, so $\\sin^2(\\theta/2) = 1/4$.\nThe ratio of the measured electron cross-section to the Rutherford prediction is:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_e = 1 - \\beta_e^2 \\sin^2(60^\\circ/2) = 1 - (0.3006) \\times (0.5)^2 = 1 - (0.3006)(0.25) \\approx 1 - 0.07515 = 0.92485$$\nThis ratio is approximately $0.92$. The cross-section is suppressed relative to the Rutherford formula.\n\nFor the alpha particle (a spin-$0$ particle):\nAs stated in Foundation 3, a spin-$0$ particle has no intrinsic spin and therefore no intrinsic magnetic moment. Consequently, there is no spin-orbit interaction and no spin-flip amplitude. The relativistic treatment for a spin-$0$ particle is the Klein-Gordon equation, but since we have established that the alpha particle is highly non-relativistic ($\\beta_\\alpha \\approx 0.05$), any relativistic corrections will be minuscule. The leading kinematic corrections are of order $\\beta_\\alpha^2 \\approx 0.0027$. Therefore, the scattering of these alpha particles is extremely well-described by the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation, which yields the Rutherford formula.\nThe ratio of the measured alpha particle cross-section to the Rutherford prediction is:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_\\alpha \\approx 1$$\nAny deviation from $1$ would be on the order of $\\beta_\\alpha^2$, which is less than $0.3\\%$, and thus negligible for the purposes of this problem.\n\nWith these results, we evaluate the options.\n\nA. For unpolarized electron scattering from a spinless heavy nucleus, interference between Dirac spin amplitudes suppresses the differential cross section by a factor of the form $1 - \\beta_e^2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ relative to the Rutherford result. A spin-$0$ alpha projectile does not experience such spin interference, so at nonrelativistic speeds its differential cross section follows the Rutherford form. At $T_e = 100\\,\\text{keV}$ and $\\theta = 60^\\circ$, the ratio of electron data to Rutherford is approximately $0.92$, while for the $T_\\alpha = 5\\,\\text{MeV}$ alpha beam the ratio is approximately $1$.\nThis option provides a physically correct explanation for both projectiles. The Mott correction for electrons is described correctly as a suppression originating from spin effects in the relativistic Dirac theory. The alpha particle is correctly identified as spin-$0$ and non-relativistic, thus following the Rutherford formula. The calculated numerical ratios, $\\approx 0.92$ for electrons and $\\approx 1$ for alpha particles, match our derived values. **Correct**.\n\nB. Spin interactions with the Coulomb field enhance electron scattering at larger angles, giving a multiplicative factor $1 + \\beta_e^2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ relative to Rutherford. Composite structure similarly enhances alpha scattering. At $T_e = 100\\,\\text{keV}$ and $\\theta = 60^\\circ$, the electron ratio is approximately $1.08$, and the alpha ratio is greater than $1$ for the same reason.\nThe sign of the correction is wrong; it is a suppression, not an enhancement. The explanation for the alpha particle is also incorrect; its composite structure leads to a *decrease* of the cross-section relative to Rutherford at large momentum transfers (large angles), not an enhancement. **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The static Coulomb potential is spin-independent, so spin cannot affect the electron angular distribution. Deviations from Rutherford require nuclear spin, which is absent here; therefore both the electron and alpha data follow the Rutherford law at all angles, and both ratios equal $1$.\nThis displays a fundamental misunderstanding of relativistic quantum mechanics. While the Coulomb potential $V(r)$ is 'spin-independent', the full relativistic interaction of a Dirac particle (possessing spin) within this potential *is* spin-dependent through the spin-orbit term. This effect is present even for a spinless nucleus. **Incorrect**.\n\nD.

Thus the electron and alpha ratios at $\\theta = 60^\\circ$ are identical functions of their respective $\\beta$, independent of angle.\nThis is incorrect. The primary correction for the electron is spin-dependent and also depends on the scattering angle $\\theta$, as shown by the $\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ term. The correction is not universal for all projectiles, as spin-$0$ particles behave differently. The factor is not simply $1-\\beta^2$. **Incorrect**.\n\nE. The suppression factor $1 - \\beta_e^2 \\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ applies to electrons, but Thomas precession imposes an analogous reduction for spin-$0$ alpha particles, so both beams are reduced by essentially the same angular and velocity dependence at the stated energies.\nThe first part about the suppression factor for electrons is correct. However, the second part is false. Thomas precession is a relativistic kinematic effect relevant to particles *with spin*; it corrects the spin-orbit interaction energy. A spin-$0$ particle has no spin, so Thomas precession is irrelevant to its dynamics in this context.
