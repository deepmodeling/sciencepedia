This decay is governed by the V-A (\"Vector minus Axial-vector\") theory, which dictates that the interacting fields must have a definite chirality. Specifically, the produced antimuon is in a right-chiral state, while the muon neutrino is in a left-chiral state.\n\nFor a massless particle, chirality is identical to helicity (the projection of spin onto momentum). A left-chiral particle always has left-handed helicity. Since the neutrino is nearly massless, it is produced with its spin anti-aligned with its momentum.\n\nFor the massive antimuon, however, a state of definite chirality is a superposition of helicity eigenstates. A right-chiral antifermion state $|\\bar{\\psi}_R\\rangle$ with energy $E$ and momentum magnitude $p$ is composed of positive helicity ($h=+1$, spin parallel to momentum) and negative helicity ($h=-1$, spin anti-parallel to momentum) components.
