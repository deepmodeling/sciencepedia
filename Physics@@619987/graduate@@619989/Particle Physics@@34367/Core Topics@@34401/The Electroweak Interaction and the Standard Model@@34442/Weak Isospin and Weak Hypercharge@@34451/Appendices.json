This exercise invites you to explore this profound concept by verifying the anomaly cancellation conditions for a hypothetical fourth generation of fermions. This practice will reveal why the charge structure of the Standard Model is so rigid and non-negotiable, providing a glimpse into the predictive power of theoretical consistency [@problem_id:220971].", "problem": "In the Standard Model of particle physics, the gauge group is $G_{SM} = SU(3)_C \\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$. The consistency of the model as a quantum field theory requires the cancellation of all gauge and gravitational anomalies. This cancellation is observed to hold for each of the three known fermion generations independently.\n\nConsider a hypothetical fourth generation of fermions with a structure analogous to the known generations. It consists of a left-handed quark doublet $Q'_L$, a left-handed lepton doublet $L'_L$, and corresponding right-handed singlets $u'_R, d'_R, e'_R$. Let $N_c$ be the number of colors in the $SU(3)_C$ gauge theory.

For an electroweak doublet, the top component has $I_3 = +1/2$ and the bottom component has $I_3=-1/2$. For singlets, $I_3=0$. The electric charge of a particle is independent of its chirality.\n\nFor this new generation to be consistent with the gauge theory, it must be anomaly-free on its own.
