Minimization of the Potential**\n\nFirst, we find the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the field $\\vec{\\phi}$ by minimizing the potential $V(\\vec{\\phi})$.

Identification of the Masses**\n\nThe mass terms for real scalar fields appear in the Lagrangian as $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{mass}} = - \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2$. Comparing this with our potential term $-V^{(2)}$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{mass}} = -V^{(2)} = -\\lambda v^2 h^2\n$$\nFor the field $h$, we can identify its mass $m_H$ by setting:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} m_H^2 h^2 = -\\lambda v^2 h^2\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\nm_H^2 = 2\\lambda v^2\n$$\nSubstituting $v^2 = \\mu^2/\\lambda$:\n$$\nm_H^2 = 2\\lambda \\left(\\frac{\\mu^2}{\\lambda}\\right) = 2\\mu^2\n$$\nThe mass of the physical scalar boson $h$ is therefore:\n$$\nm_H = \\sqrt{2\\mu^2} = \\sqrt{2}\\mu\n$$\nThe fields $\\eta_1$ and $\\eta_2$ have no quadratic terms in the potential, which means their masses are zero:\n$$\nm_{\\eta_1} = m_{\\eta_2} = 0\n$$\nThese are the two massless Goldstone bosons, corresponding to the two broken generators of $SU(2) \\to U(1)$.
