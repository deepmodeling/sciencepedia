At high-energy electron-positron colliders like the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP), Z bosons can be produced copiously as a resonance. The total decay width of the Z boson, $\\Gamma_Z$, is a fundamental observable and is given by the sum of its partial decay widths into all possible final states.\n\nThe primary decay channels are into quark-antiquark pairs (which form hadrons), charged lepton-antilepton pairs, and neutrino-antineutrino pairs. The total width can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Gamma_Z = \\Gamma_{\\text{had}} + \\Gamma_{\\text{leptonic}} + \\Gamma_{\\text{invisible}} $$\nwhere $\\Gamma_{\\text{had}}$ is the total hadronic width, $\\Gamma_{\\text{leptonic}}$ is the width into charged leptons ($e, \\mu, \\tau$), and $\\Gamma_{\\text{invisible}}$ is the width into neutrinos.\n\nAssuming lepton universality, the partial widths into the three charged lepton species are identical: $\\Gamma_{e\\bar{e}} = \\Gamma_{\\mu\\bar{\\mu}} = \\Gamma_{\\tau\\bar{\\tau}} \\equiv \\Gamma_{\\ell\\ell}$.
