Quarks are spin-1/2 fermions, and by convention, they are assigned a positive intrinsic parity, $P_q = +1$. The total parity $P$ of a three-quark baryon is given by the product of the intrinsic parities of its constituent quarks and a factor related to the internal orbital configuration: $P = P_{q1} P_{q2} P_{q3} (-1)^L$, where $L$ is the total internal orbital angular momentum of the quarks. The total angular momentum of the baryon, denoted by the quantum number $J$, is the vector sum of the total orbital angular momentum $L$ and the total quark spin $S$, i.e., $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$, where $\\vec{S}$ is the vector sum of the individual quark spins.\n\nA \"spin multiplet\" is a set of states that share the same values of $L$ and $S$ but differ in their total angular momentum $J$. The possible values of $J$ in such a multiplet are given by the standard rules of angular momentum addition: $J = |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \\dots, L+S$.\n\nThe $N(1535)$ is an excited state of the nucleon with experimentally determined quantum numbers $J^P = 1/2^-$. It is understood to be the lowest-lying negative-parity excitation, meaning it corresponds to the smallest possible value of $L$ that results in negative parity. Furthermore, the $N(1535)$ is part of a spin multiplet that also contains the $N(1700)$ resonance, which has quantum numbers $J^P = 3/2^-$. For the purposes of this problem, assume this spin multiplet contains only these two nucleon resonance states.\n\nYour task is to determine the values of the total internal orbital angular momentum $L$ and the total quark spin $S$ for this multiplet. Using these values, calculate the numerical value of the quantity $Q = L + 4S(S+1)$.", "solution": "1. **Determine L from Parity:**\n   The total parity of the three-quark baryon is given by $P = P_{q1}P_{q2}P_{q3}(-1)^L = (+1)^3(-1)^L = (-1)^L$.\n   The experimental parity of the $N(1535)$ is negative ($P=-1$).\n   Therefore, we must have $(-1)^L = -1$, which implies that $L$ must be an odd integer. The problem states this is the lowest-lying negative-parity excitation, so we take the smallest possible odd value: $L=1$.\n\n2. **Determine S from Angular Momentum:**\n   The total angular momentum $J$ is the vector sum of $L$ and the total quark spin $S$. The possible values for $J$ are $J = |L-S|, \\dots, L+S$. The spin of three quarks can be $S=1/2$ or $S=3/2$.\n   We test both possibilities with our value $L=1$:\n   - If $S=3/2$, the possible $J$ values are $J = |1 - 3/2|, \\dots, 1+3/2$, which are $J=1/2, 3/2, 5/2$. This multiplet would contain three states.\n   - If $S=1/2$, the possible $J$ values are $J = |1 - 1/2|, \\dots, 1+1/2$, which are $J=1/2, 3/2$.\n   The problem states that the multiplet contains only two states, $N(1535)$ with $J=1/2$ and $N(1700)$ with $J=3/2$. This perfectly matches the case where $S=1/2$. Thus, we conclude $L=1$ and $S=1/2$.\n\n3. **Calculate Q:**\n   Substitute the values of $L$ and $S$ into the given expression:\n   $$Q = L + 4S(S+1) = 1 + 4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right) = 1 + 4\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = 1 + 4\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right) = 1 + 3 = 4.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "184547"}, {"introduction": "Beyond describing static properties, conservation laws are the engine of dynamics in particle physics, dictating which processes can and cannot occur.
