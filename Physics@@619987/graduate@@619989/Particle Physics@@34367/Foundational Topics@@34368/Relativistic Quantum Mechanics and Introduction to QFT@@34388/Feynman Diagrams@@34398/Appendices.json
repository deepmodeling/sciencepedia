At the one-loop level, one of the contributions to the scattering amplitude involves the s-channel diagram. In this process, the two incoming particles with total four-momentum $p = p_1 + p_2$ create a pair of virtual particles which subsequently annihilate to produce the two outgoing particles.\n\nThe part of the amplitude corresponding to this loop diagram is proportional to the integral $I(s)$, where $s=p^2$ is the Mandelstam variable representing the square of the center-of-mass energy. The integral is given by:\n$$ I(s) = \\int \\frac{d^4 k}{(2\\pi)^4} \\frac{1}{k^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{(p-k)^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon} $$\nAs a function of the complex variable $s$, the integral $I(s)$ is analytic except for a branch cut along the real axis. The appearance of this branch cut signals the possibility of producing physical on-shell particles in the intermediate state. The branch point, denoted as $s_{th}$, is the threshold value of $s$ where the branch cut begins.\n\nYour task is to determine this threshold value $s_{th}$. The threshold corresponds to the value of $s$ at which the integral $I(s)$ first develops an imaginary part for real $s$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the threshold value $s_{th}$ where the integral $I(s)$ develops a branch cut. This occurs when the integrand develops poles that pinch the integration contour, a condition we can find by analyzing the denominator of the integral after introducing a Feynman parameter.\n\nThe starting point is the integral:\n$$ I(s) = \\int \\frac{d^4 k}{(2\\pi)^4} \\frac{1}{k^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{(p-k)^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon} $$\nwhere $s = p^2$.\n\nFirst, we combine the two propagator denominators using the Feynman parameter identity:\n$$ \\frac{1}{AB} = \\int_0^1 dx \\frac{1}{[xA + (1-x)B]^2} $$\nLet $A = (p-k)^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon$ and $B = k^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon$. The denominator in the integrand becomes:\n$$ D(k,p,x) = x((p-k)^2 - m^2) + (1-x)(k^2-m^2) + i\\epsilon $$\nExpanding the terms within the denominator:\n$$ D(k,p,x) = x(p^2 - 2p \\cdot k + k^2 - m^2) + (1-x)(k^2 - m^2) + i\\epsilon $$\n$$ D(k,p,x) = xp^2 - 2x p \\cdot k + xk^2 - xm^2 + k^2 - m^2 - xk^2 + xm^2 + i\\epsilon $$\n$$ D(k,p,x) = k^2 - 2x p \\cdot k + x p^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon $$\nNext, we complete the square for the loop momentum $k$. Let's define a shifted momentum variable $k' = k - xp$. Then $k = k' + xp$, and $k^2 = (k' + xp)^2 = k'^2 + 2x p \\cdot k' + x^2 p^2$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D$ is not what we want. We combine terms based on $k$:\n$$ D(k,p,x) = (k - xp)^2 - (xp)^2 + xp^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon $$\nLet $k' = k - xp$. The denominator becomes:\n$$ D(k',p,x) = k'^2 - x^2p^2 + xp^2 - m^2 + i\\epsilon $$\n$$ D(k',p,x) = k'^2 - p^2 x(1-x) - m^2 + i\\epsilon $$\nSince the integration measure $d^4k$ is translationally invariant, $d^4k = d^4k'$. The integral $I(s)$ can be rewritten as:\n$$ I(s) = \\int_0^1 dx \\int \\frac{d^4 k'}{(2\\pi)^4} \\frac{1}{[k'^2 - (m^2 - p^2 x(1-x)) + i\\epsilon]^2} $$\nLet's define the quantity $\\Delta(s, x) = m^2 - s x(1-x)$, where we replaced $p^2$ with $s$. The denominator of the integrand is $[(k')^2 - \\Delta(s,x) + i\\epsilon]^2$.\nThe integral over $k'$ is now a standard form. After a Wick rotation ($k'_0 = i k'_{E}$), the momentum-space integral becomes an integral over Euclidean space, which is real and positive for positive $\\Delta$.\n$$ \\int \\frac{d^4 k'_E}{(2\\pi)^4} \\frac{1}{(k'_E{}^2 + \\Delta(s,x))^2} $$\nFor the integral to be well-defined and purely real (up to an overall factor of $i$ from the Wick rotation), the term $\\Delta(s,x)$ must be positive for all values of $x$ in the integration range $[0, 1]$. An imaginary part of $I(s)$ is generated when $\\Delta(s,x)$ becomes negative for some part of the integration range. The branch point $s_{th}$ is the value of $s$ for which $\\Delta(s,x)$ first touches zero for some value of $x \\in [0,1]$.\n\nSo we need to find the condition for $\\Delta(s, x) = 0$:\n$$ m^2 - s x(1-x) = 0 $$\n$$ s = \\frac{m^2}{x(1-x)} $$\nWe are looking for the minimum value of $s$ (the threshold) for which this condition can be satisfied for an $x \\in [0,1]$. This corresponds to finding the value of $x$ that maximizes the denominator $f(x) = x(1-x)$ on the interval $[0,1]$.\n\nTo find the maximum of $f(x)$, we take its derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{df}{dx} = 1 - 2x = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThis value lies within the interval $[0,1]$. The value of the function at this point is:\n$$ f(1/2) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nAt the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=1$, $f(x)=0$, so $x=1/2$ is indeed the maximum.\n\nThe minimum value of $s$ that allows $\\Delta(s,x)$ to be zero is thus:\n$$ s_{th} = \\frac{m^2}{\\max_{x \\in [0,1]} \\{x(1-x)\\}} = \\frac{m^2}{1/4} = 4m^2 $$\nFor $s < 4m^2$, the quantity $s x(1-x) \\le s/4 < m^2$, so $\\Delta(s,x) > 0$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$, and the integral $I(s)$ is real.\nFor $s > 4m^2$, there is a range of $x$ values for which $\\Delta(s,x) < 0$, leading to a non-zero imaginary part for $I(s)$.\nThus, the branch cut starts at $s = 4m^2$.
