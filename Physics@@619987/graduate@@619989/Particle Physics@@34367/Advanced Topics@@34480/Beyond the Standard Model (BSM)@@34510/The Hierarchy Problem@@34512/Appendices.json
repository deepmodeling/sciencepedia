The details of the supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking mechanism are parametrized by a set of soft SUSY-breaking terms in the Lagrangian. The renormalization group (RG) running of these soft parameters from a high energy scale (like the GUT scale) down to the electroweak scale is crucial for the phenomenological viability of the model.\n\nOne of the most important soft SUSY-breaking parameters is the trilinear scalar coupling $A_t$, associated with the top quark Yukawa interaction. It appears in the soft SUSY-breaking Laguna gian $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{soft}}$ as part of the term:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{soft}} \\supset -a_t \\tilde{Q}_{L,3} \\cdot H_u \\tilde{t}_{R,3}^* + \\text{h.c.} $$\nwhere $a_t = y_t A_t$. Here, $y_t$ is the top Yukawa coupling, $\\tilde{Q}_{L,3}$ is the third-generation left-handed squark doublet (containing the stop $\\tilde{t}_L$), $\\tilde{t}_{R,3}$ is the right-handed stop squark, and $H_u$ is the up-type Higgs doublet. Another relevant soft term is the gluino mass term, $-\\frac{1}{2}M_3 \\tilde{g}^a \\tilde{g}^a$.\n\nThe one-loop Renormalization Group Equation (RGE) for the parameter $A_t$ takes the form:\n$$ 16\\pi^2 \\frac{d A_t}{dt} = \\beta_{A_t} $$\nwhere $t = \\ln(\\mu)$ is the logarithm of the renormalization scale $\\mu$. The beta function $\\beta_{A_t}$ receives contributions from various loops, including those with gauginos.\n\nThe contribution to the RGE of $A_t$ originating from gaugino masses can be calculated using the spurion technique. The gaugino mass contribution to the beta function of the coupling combination $a_t = y_t A_t$ is given by\n$$ \\beta_{a_t}\\Big|_{\\text{gaugino}} = -4 y_t \\sum_{a=1,2,3} g_a^2 M_a \\left( C_a(\\tilde{Q}_{L,3}) + C_a(H_u) + C_a(\\tilde{t}_R^*) \\right) $$\nwhere the sum is over the MSSM gauge groups $G_a \\in \\{U(1)_Y, SU(2)_L, SU(3)_c\\}$, with corresponding gauge couplings $g_a$ and gaugino masses $M_a$. The function $C_a(\\phi)$ denotes the quadratic Casimir invariant of the representation of the scalar field $\\phi$ under the gauge group $G_a$. The fields $\\tilde{Q}_{L,3}, H_u, \\tilde{t}_R^*$ transform under the color group $SU(3)_c$ as a fundamental (**3**), singlet (**1**), and anti-fundamental (**$\\bar{3}$**) representation, respectively. For a general $SU(N)$ group, the quadratic Casimir of the fundamental representation is $C(fund) = \\frac{N^2-1}{2N}$. The Casimir for an anti-fundamental representation is the same as the fundamental one, and the Casimir for a singlet is zero.\n\nThe RGE for $A_t$ is related to that of $a_t$ by the Leibniz rule:\n$$ \\beta_{a_t} = 16\\pi^2 \\frac{d(y_t A_t)}{dt} = y_t (16\\pi^2 \\frac{dA_t}{dt}) + A_t(16\\pi^2 \\frac{dy_t}{dt}) = y_t \\beta_{A_t} + A_t \\beta_{y_t} $$\nThe one-loop beta function for the Yukawa coupling, $\\beta_{y_t}$, does not depend on the gaugino masses. This implies that the gaugino mass contribution to $\\beta_{A_t}$ can be isolated as $\\beta_{A_t}|_{\\text{gaugino}} = \\frac{1}{y_t}\\beta_{a_t}|_{\\text{gaugino}}$.\n\nUsing the information provided, determine the coefficient $C_3$ for the gluino contribution to the one-loop beta function of $A_t$, which is structured as:\n$$ \\beta_{A_t}\\Big|_{\\text{gaugino}} = C_1 g_1^2 M_1 + C_2 g_2^2 M_2 + C_3 g_3^2 M_3 $$\nYour task is to calculate the specific numerical value of $C_3$.\n\n", "solution": "1.
