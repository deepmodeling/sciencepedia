Among the most important topological invariants are the Hodge numbers, $h^{p,q}(M)$, which are the dimensions of the Dolbeault cohomology groups $H^{p,q}(M)$.\n\nFor a Calabi-Yau threefold $M$, the only non-trivial Hodge numbers are $h^{0,0}=h^{3,3}=h^{3,0}=h^{0,3}=1$, and $h^{1,1}$ and $h^{2,1}$ (and those related by Hodge duality, $h^{p,q}=h^{q,p}$). In the context of type II string theory compactifications, $h^{1,1}$ corresponds to the number of KÃ¤hler moduli (related to sizes and shapes of 2-cycles) and $h^{2,1}$ corresponds to the number of complex structure moduli (related to the shape of the manifold itself).\n\nThe Euler characteristic of a Calabi-Yau threefold $M$ is given by $\\chi(M) = 2(h^{1,1}(M) - h^{2,1}(M))$.
