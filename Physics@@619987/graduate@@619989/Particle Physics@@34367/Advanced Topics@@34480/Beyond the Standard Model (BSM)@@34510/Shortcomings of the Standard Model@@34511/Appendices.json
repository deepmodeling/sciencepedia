This simple model predicts the mass relation $m_d = m_e$, $m_s = m_\\mu$, etc., at the GUT scale, which is phenomenologically incorrect for the lighter generations.\n\nThe Georgi-Jarlskog model attempts to correct this by introducing an additional Higgs field in the $\\mathbf{45}_H$ representation. The down-type quark and charged lepton masses arise from Yukawa couplings to both the $\\mathbf{5}_H$ and $\\mathbf{45}_H$ Higgs fields.
