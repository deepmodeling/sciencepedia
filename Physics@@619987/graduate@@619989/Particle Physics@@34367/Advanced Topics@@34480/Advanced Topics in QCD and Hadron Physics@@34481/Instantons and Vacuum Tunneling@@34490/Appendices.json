Identifying the Tunneling Path**\n\nThe bounce solution is an $O(4)$-symmetric field configuration that extremizes the Euclidean action $S_E$. We adopt the ansatz that fields depend only on the Euclidean radial coordinate $r = \\sqrt{x_\\mu x^\\mu}$, i.e., $\\chi = \\chi(r)$ and $\\theta = \\theta(r)$.\n\nThe configuration must minimize the potential energy at each point along the tunneling path.
