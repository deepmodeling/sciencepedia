If the light quark masses ($m_u, m_d, ...$) were zero, the QCD Lagrangian would possess a global chiral symmetry $SU(N_f)_L \\times SU(N_f)_R$. This symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the vector subgroup $SU(N_f)_V$, leading to the emergence of $N_f^2-1$ massless Goldstone bosons.\n\nThe small, non-zero quark masses explicitly break the chiral symmetry. This gives the pseudo-Goldstone bosons, such as the pions, their small masses. The effect of explicit symmetry breaking can be quantified by various parameters. One such quantity is the pion-nucleon sigma term, $\\sigma_{\\pi N}$.
