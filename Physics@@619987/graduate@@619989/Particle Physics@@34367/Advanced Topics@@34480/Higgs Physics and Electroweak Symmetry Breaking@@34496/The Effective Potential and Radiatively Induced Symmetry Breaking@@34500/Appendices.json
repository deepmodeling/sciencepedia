This practice explores the celebrated Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, a prime example of radiatively induced symmetry breaking.

The scalar potential is given by:\n$$\nV(\\phi) = m^2|\\phi|^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}(|\\phi|^2)^2\n$$\nWe are interested in the phenomenon of radiatively induced symmetry breaking, as described by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. To study this, we consider the theory to be classically massless, meaning the mass parameter in the tree-level potential is set to $m^2=0$.\n\nThe symmetry breaking is assumed to be driven by quantum corrections from the gauge sector. Therefore, you should work under the approximation that the contribution of the scalar self-interaction to the one-loop effective potential is negligible, which is valid if $\\lambda \\ll e^4$.\n\nAs a result of radiative corrections, the scalar field develops a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV). By convention, we align this VEV along the real part of the scalar field, such that $\\langle \\phi \\rangle = v/\\sqrt{2}$, where $v$ is a real constant. This spontaneous symmetry breaking gives rise to a massive physical scalar particle, which we call the \"scalar boson\", with mass $m_S$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the vacuum expectation value $v$ in terms of the scalar boson mass $m_S$ and the gauge coupling $e$. For this calculation, work in the Landau gauge ($\\xi=0$) and use the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme where the one-loop correction to the effective potential from a particle species $j$ with $n_j$ degrees of freedom and field-dependent mass $M_j(\\phi_c)$ is given by:\n$$\nV_{1,j}(\\phi_c) = \\frac{n_j}{64\\pi^2} M_j^4(\\phi_c) \\left(\\ln\\frac{M_j^2(\\phi_c)}{\\mu^2} - C_j\\right)\n$$\nwith $\\hbar=1$.
