In technicolor theories, the first step is to perform a census of these NGBs, which depends entirely on the symmetry structure of the theory and the representation of the new fermions. This exercise provides crucial practice in this fundamental accounting by having you determine the number of NGBs for a specific technicolor scenario, connecting abstract group theory to a physical particle count [@problem_id:203531].", "problem": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIn theoretical physics, Technicolor models propose that the Higgs boson is not fundamental but a composite state, formed by the condensation of new fermions (technifermions) bound by a new strong gauge force called the technicolor force. This mechanism is analogous to the formation of Cooper pairs in superconductivity or chiral symmetry breaking in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).\n\nThe number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs) that arise from dynamical symmetry breaking depends crucially on the global symmetries of the theory and the representation of the technifermions under the technicolor gauge group.\n\nConsider a gauge theory with a simple gauge group $G_{TC}$ and $N_f$ flavors of massless Dirac technifermions. The global chiral symmetry group $G$ and its breaking pattern due to a fermion condensate $\\langle\\bar\\Psi\\Psi\\rangle \\neq 0$ depend on the reality of the representation $R$ under which the technifermions transform:\n\n1.  **Complex Representation ($R \\not\\cong R^*$):** The global symmetry is $G = SU(N_f)_L \\times SU(N_f)_R \\times U(1)_V$. This breaks to the diagonal subgroup $H = SU(N_f)_V \\times U(1)_V$. The anomalous axial $U(1)_A$ symmetry is disregarded.\n\n2.  **Real Representation ($R \\cong R^*$, with a symmetric intertwining matrix):** The global symmetry is enhanced to $G = SU(2N_f)$. This breaks to the symplectic group $H = Sp(2N_f)$.\n\n3.  **Pseudo-real (Quaternionic) Representation ($R \\cong R^*$, with an anti-symmetric intertwining matrix):** The global symmetry is also enhanced to $G = SU(2N_f)$. This breaks to the special orthogonal group $H = SO(2N_f)$.\n\n**The Task:**\n\nConsider a technicolor model based on the gauge group $G_{TC} = SU(N_{TC})$ with $N_{TC}=2$. The matter content consists of $N_f$ Dirac technifermions transforming in the **two-index symmetric representation** of this $SU(2)$ gauge group.\n\nAssuming that the technicolor interactions are strong enough to form a fermion condensate, determine the number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons generated by the spontaneous breaking of the global chiral symmetry.

This practice uses the powerful framework of a non-linear sigma model to demonstrate precisely how this happens, challenging you to derive the mass of the $W$ boson and reveal the direct link between the electroweak scale and the fundamental scale of the new strong dynamics [@problem_id:782476].", "problem": "In certain extensions of the Standard Model, such as Technicolor theories, electroweak symmetry is dynamically broken by a new strong interaction, leading to the formation of composite Goldstone bosons analogous to the pions of QCD.
