For physical QCD, $N_c=3$. The generators of the SU($N_c$) group in the fundamental representation are denoted by $N_c \\times N_c$ matrices $T^a$, where $a=1, \\dots, N_c^2-1$. These generators are traceless, Hermitian, and obey the normalization convention $\\mathrm{Tr}(T^a T^b) = T_R \\delta^{ab}$. For SU(3), the normalization constant is $T_R=1/2$.\n\nConsider the tree-level scattering process of two gluons into a quark-antiquark pair: $g(a) + g(b) \\to q(i) + \\bar{q}(j)$, where $a,b$ are the color indices of the initial-state gluons (adjoint representation) and $i,j$ are the color indices of the final-state quark and antiquark (fundamental representation).\n\nThis process is described by three Feynman diagrams: an $s$-channel gluon exchange, a $t$-channel quark exchange, and a $u$-channel quark exchange. The color factors for the $t$-channel and $u$-channel amplitudes can be written as:\n-   $\\mathcal{C}_{t} = (T^a T^b)_{ij}$\n-   $\\mathcal{C}_{u} = (T^b T^a)_{ij}$\n\nWhen calculating the total cross-section, one encounters the interference term between the $t$ and $u$ channel amplitudes. The color factor for this interference term, after averaging over the initial gluon colors and summing over the final quark/antiquark colors, is given by the expression:\n$$\nC_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{1}{(N_c^2-1)^2} \\sum_{a,b=1}^{N_c^2-1} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{N_c} \\mathcal{C}_{t} (\\mathcal{C}_{u})^\\dagger\n$$\n\nCalculate the value of $C_{\\text{int}}$ for the physical case of QCD, where the gauge group is SU(3) and the normalization constant is $T_R=1/2$.", "solution": "1.  First, write the color sum explicitly.

Substitute this back into the expression for $S$:\n    $$\n    S = \\sum_b \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( \\left(\\sum_a T^a T^b T^a\\right) T^b \\right) = \\sum_b \\mathrm{Tr}\\left( \\left(- \\frac{T_R}{N_c} T^b\\right) T^b \\right) = - \\frac{T_R}{N_c} \\sum_b \\mathrm{Tr}(T^b T^b)\n    $$\n5.
