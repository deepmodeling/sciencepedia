The first Brillouin zone is defined for $k \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$.\n\nConsider two distinct three-phonon fusion events:\n\n1.  **A Normal Process (N):** Two phonons with wavevectors $k_{1,N} = \\frac{\\pi}{3a}$ and $k_{2,N} = \\frac{\\pi}{6a}$ fuse together.\n2.  **An Umklapp Process (U):** Two phonons with wavevectors $k_{1,U} = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$ and $k_{2,U} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3a}$ fuse together.\n\nIn both cases, the wavevector of the resulting phonon ($k_N$ for the Normal process, $k_U$ for the Umklapp process) is determined by the law of conservation of crystal momentum, where the final wavevector is mapped back into the first Brillouin zone. The energy of the resulting phonon is then determined by its wavevector via the given dispersion relation, i.e., $E = \\hbar \\omega(k)$.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the energy of the phonon produced in the Normal process to that produced in the Umklapp process, $R = E_N / E_U$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of the energies of the final phonons in two separate fusion events: a Normal process and an Umklapp process. The energy of a phonon is related to its frequency by $E = \\hbar \\omega$.
