The neutron wavevector of the incident beam is denoted by $\\mathbf{k}_{i}$ and that of the scattered beam by $\\mathbf{k}_{f}$. The momentum transfer is $\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{k}_{i}-\\mathbf{k}_{f}$ and the energy transfer is $\\hbar\\omega=E_{i}-E_{f}$, where $E_{i}$ and $E_{f}$ are the neutron kinetic energies before and after scattering from the sample. Energy selection in TAS arises from Bragg scattering off the monochromator and analyzer crystals, each set at a Bragg angle that selects a single wavelength according to Bragg’s law. In fixed-final-energy mode, the analyzer sets $E_{f}$ while the monochromator sets $E_{i}$ to realize the desired $(\\mathbf{Q},\\omega)$.\n\nConsider a TAS operated in fixed-final-energy mode with the analyzer set to a final neutron energy $E_{f}=14.7\\,\\mathrm{meV}$.

It is a standard problem in the physics of neutron scattering. Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe fundamental principles governing this problem are the nonrelativistic kinetic energy of a neutron, the de Broglie relation, and Bragg's law for crystal diffraction.\n\nThe kinetic energy $E$ of a nonrelativistic particle of mass $m_n$ and momentum $p$ is given by:\n$$E = \\frac{p^2}{2m_n}$$\nThe de Broglie relation connects the particle's momentum $p$ to the magnitude of its wavevector $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$:\n$$p = \\hbar k$$\nCombining these two relations, we obtain the dispersion relation for a free neutron:\n$$E = \\frac{(\\hbar k)^2}{2m_n} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_n}$$\nThis equation establishes a direct relationship between the neutron's kinetic energy $E$ and the magnitude of its wavevector $k$. We can rearrange it to solve for $k$:\n$$k = \\sqrt{\\frac{2m_n E}{\\hbar^2}}$$\nThe constant $\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_n}$ is a useful quantity in neutron scattering and has a value of approximately $2.072\\,\\mathrm{meV \\cdot \\AA^2}$.\n\nThe selection of a specific neutron wavelength $\\lambda$ by the monochromator and analyzer crystals is governed by Bragg's law. For first-order diffraction ($n=1$), the law is:\n$$2d\\sin(\\theta) = \\lambda$$\nwhere $d$ is the interplanar spacing of the crystal lattice planes and $\\theta$ is the Bragg angle.\n\nThe wavelength $\\lambda$ is related to the wavevector magnitude $k$ by:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}$$\nBy substituting this into Bragg's law, we can relate the Bragg angle $\\theta$ directly to the wavevector $k$:\n$$2d\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{2\\pi}{k}$$\n$$\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi}{dk}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$ in terms of energy $E$, we arrive at the final relation required to determine the Bragg angles:\n$$\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi}{d\\sqrt{\\frac{2m_n E}{\\hbar^2}}} = \\frac{\\pi \\hbar}{d \\sqrt{2m_n E}}$$\nThis is the equation that connects the Bragg angle $\\theta$ of the monochromator or analyzer to the energy $E$ of the neutrons it is set to select.

The required energy transfer is given as $\\hbar\\omega = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{meV}$. This is a neutron energy loss process, so the incident energy $E_i$ must be higher than the final energy $E_f$.\n$$E_i = E_f + \\hbar\\omega = 14.7\\,\\mathrm{meV} + 5.0\\,\\mathrm{meV} = 19.7\\,\\mathrm{meV}$$\nThe magnitude of the incident neutron wavevector, $k_i$, is:\n$$k_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_i}{\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_n}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{19.7\\,\\mathrm{meV}}{2.072\\,\\mathrm{meV \\cdot \\AA^2}}} \\approx 3.0833\\,\\mathrm{\\AA^{-1}}$$\nThe monochromator crystal is identical to the analyzer, with $d = 3.355\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$.

The magnitude $|\\mathbf{Q}|$ depends on $k_i$, $k_f$, and the angle $\\phi$ between $\\mathbf{k}_i$ and $\\mathbf{k}_f$ at the sample position, according to the law of cosines: $|\\mathbf{Q}|^2 = k_i^2 + k_f^2 - 2k_i k_f \\cos(\\phi)$. Since $k_i$ and $k_f$ are now fixed, the given $|\\mathbf{Q}|$ can be achieved by setting the appropriate sample scattering angle $\\phi$. This parameter is not needed for the calculation of the monochromator and analyzer angles.\n\nThe calculated Bragg angles, rounded to four significant figures, are $\\theta_M = 17.68^\\circ$ and $\\theta_A = 20.58^\\circ$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 17.68 & 20.58 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2493196"}, {"introduction": "No instrument is perfect, and its limitations are always imprinted on the data we collect.
