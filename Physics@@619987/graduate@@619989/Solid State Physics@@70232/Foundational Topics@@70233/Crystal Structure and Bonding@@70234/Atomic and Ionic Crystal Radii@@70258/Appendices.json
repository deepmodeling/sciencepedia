An octahedral interstitial site in an FCC lattice is located at a position that is equidistant from six host lattice atoms. One such site is at the body center of the conventional unit cell.\n\nAssuming the host atoms are perfect, rigid spheres of radius $R$, determine the radius, $r$, of the largest guest atom (also assumed to be a rigid sphere) that can fit into an octahedral interstitial site without distorting the lattice.

The face diagonal length is $a\\sqrt{2}$, where $a$ is the lattice constant. Along this diagonal, the distance from a corner atom to a face-center atom is $2R$ (the sum of the radii of two touching atoms). Since the face-center atom is at the midpoint of the diagonal, the full face diagonal length is $4R$.
