To overcome this, physicists have developed clever approximation schemes. This exercise introduces Evjen's method, a physically intuitive approach that groups ions into charge-neutral shells to accelerate convergence. By working through this method for a 2D square lattice, you will gain hands-on experience with a practical technique for estimating the cohesive energy of ionic crystals [@problem_id:133020].", "problem": "An infinite two-dimensional square lattice consists of alternating positive and negative ions of charge $\\pm q$. The distance between any ion and its nearest neighbors is $R$. The electrostatic potential energy of a single reference ion in the field of all other ions is given by the expression $U = -\\alpha \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0}\\frac{q^2}{R}$, where $\\alpha$ is the dimensionless Madelung constant for the lattice.\n\nThe Madelung constant can be approximated using Evjen's method. This method involves summing the potential contributions from ions within a specified region centered on the reference ion. The contribution of each ion is weighted based on its location relative to the region's boundary. For a 2D square region, an ion fully inside contributes its full charge, an ion on an edge contributes $1/2$ of its charge, and an ion on a corner contributes $1/4$ of its charge. The rationale is that these fractional charges represent the portion of the ion that is effectively \"owned\" by the region. This procedure improves the convergence of the sum by grouping ions into nearly charge-neutral shells.\n\nConsider a reference ion with charge $-q$ located at the origin $(0,0)$. The other ions are located at positions $(mR, nR)$ where $m$ and $n$ are integers (not simultaneously zero), and their charge is given by $q_{m,n} = (-1)^{m+n+1} q$.\n\nYour task is to calculate an approximation for the Madelung constant, $\\alpha$, by applying Evjen's method to the first neutral shell.
