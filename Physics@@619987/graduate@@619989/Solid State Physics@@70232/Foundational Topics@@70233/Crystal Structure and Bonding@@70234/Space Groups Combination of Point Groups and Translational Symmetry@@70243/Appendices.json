The presence of non-symmorphic elements like glide planes and screw axes leads to systematic extinctions—the complete absence of certain Bragg reflections. This exercise provides a crucial link between theory and experiment, asking you to derive the condition for these systematic absences from a crystal's known symmetry operations. Understanding this connection is essential, as it is the primary method crystallographers use to experimentally determine the space group of a material [@problem_id:213782].", "problem": "An orthorhombic crystal with a primitive lattice ($P$) is described by a space group whose point group is $D_{2h} (mmm)$.

The problem states that the origin is a center of inversion. This means that for each given GEP $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$, there must be a corresponding inverted position $(-x_j, -y_j, -z_j)$. This gives a total of 8 GEPs for the space group. We are interested in the structure factor $F_{h0l}$ for reflections where $k=0$. The phase contribution from a position $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ is $e^{2\\pi i (hx_j + lz_j)}$. The full set of positions is:\n- (1) $(x, y, z)$ and its inverse $(-x, -y, -z)$\n- (2) $(-x, -y, z)$ and its inverse $(x, y, -z)$\n- (3) $(-x, y, -z+1/2)$ and its inverse $(x, -y, z-1/2)$\n- (4) $(x, -y, -z+1/2)$ and its inverse $(-x, y, z-1/2)$\n\n2. The structure factor $F_{h0l}$ is the sum of the contributions from all 8 positions (assuming a single atom type with scattering factor $f$):\n$$F_{h0l} = f \\sum_{j=1}^{8} e^{2\\pi i (h x_j + l z_j)}$$\nWe can group the contribution from each position with its inverted partner.
