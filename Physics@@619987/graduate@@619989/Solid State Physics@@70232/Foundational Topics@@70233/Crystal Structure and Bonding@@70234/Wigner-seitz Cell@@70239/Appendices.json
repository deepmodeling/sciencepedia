The problem concerns the construction of a Wigner-Seitz cell for a standard two-dimensional square lattice, which is a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics.\n\nA two-dimensional Bravais lattice is defined by the set of all points $\\mathbf{R}$ given by linear combinations of primitive vectors with integer coefficients. The provided primitive vectors are $\\mathbf{a}_{1} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$. In a Cartesian coordinate system where $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ are the standard basis vectors, we can write $\\mathbf{a}_{1} = (a, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{a}_{2} = (0, a)$. A general lattice point $\\mathbf{R}$ is therefore given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{R} = n_1 \\mathbf{a}_{1} + n_2 \\mathbf{a}_{2} = (n_1 a, n_2 a)\n$$\nwhere $n_1$ and $n_2$ are integers.\n\nThe Wigner-Seitz cell is defined as the locus of points $\\mathbf{r} = (x, y)$ in space that are closer to the origin (the lattice point at $\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{0}$) than to any other lattice point $\\mathbf{R} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$. Using the Euclidean metric, this condition is expressed as:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{r}| < |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}| \\quad \\text{for all } \\mathbf{R} \\neq \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nSquaring both sides of the inequality, which is a valid operation since distances are non-negative, we get:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{r}|^2 < |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}|^2\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} < (\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{R})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} < \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - 2\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} + \\mathbf{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n2\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} < |\\mathbf{R}|^2\n$$\nGeometrically, the equality $2\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} = |\\mathbf{R}|^2$ defines a line that perpendicularly bisects the line segment connecting the origin to the lattice point $\\mathbf{R}$. The inequality defines the open half-plane containing the origin. The Wigner-Seitz cell is the intersection of all such half-planes for every lattice point $\\mathbf{R} \\neq \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThe boundary of the cell is determined by the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors to the nearest neighboring lattice points. We must therefore identify the lattice points $\\mathbf{R}$ with the smallest non-zero magnitude $|\\mathbf{R}|$. The squared magnitude of a lattice vector $\\mathbf{R} = (n_1 a, n_2 a)$ is:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{R}|^2 = (n_1 a)^2 + (n_2 a)^2 = a^2(n_1^2 + n_2^2)\n$$\nTo minimize $|\\mathbf{R}|^2$, we must find the smallest non-zero value of the integer sum $n_1^2 + n_2^2$. This minimum value is $1$, which occurs when one of the integers is $\\pm 1$ and the other is $0$. This gives us the set of four first-nearest neighbors:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $(n_1, n_2) = (1, 0) \\implies \\mathbf{R}_1 = (a, 0)$\n    \\item $(n_1, n_2) = (-1, 0) \\implies \\mathbf{R}_2 = (-a, 0)$\n    \\item $(n_1, n_2) = (0, 1) \\implies \\mathbf{R}_3 = (0, a)$\n    \\item $(n_1, n_2) = (0, -1) \\implies \\mathbf{R}_4 = (0, -a)$\n\\end{itemize}\nFor each of these vectors, $|\\mathbf{R}|^2 = a^2$. Now, we apply the inequality $2\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R} < |\\mathbf{R}|^2$ for each of these four vectors, with $\\mathbf{r} = (x, y)$:\n\n1.  For $\\mathbf{R}_1 = (a, 0)$: $2(x, y) \\cdot (a, 0) < a^2 \\implies 2ax < a^2 \\implies x < \\frac{a}{2}$.\n2.  For $\\mathbf{R}_2 = (-a, 0)$: $2(x, y) \\cdot (-a, 0) < a^2 \\implies -2ax < a^2 \\implies x > -\\frac{a}{2}$.\n3.  For $\\mathbf{R}_3 = (0, a)$: $2(x, y) \\cdot (0, a) < a^2 \\implies 2ay < a^2 \\implies y < \\frac{a}{2}$.\n4.  For $\\mathbf{R}_4 = (0, -a)$: $2(x, y) \\cdot (0, -a) < a^2 \\implies -2ay < a^2 \\implies y > -\\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nThe region defined by the intersection of these four half-planes is given by the set of inequalities:\n$$\n-\\frac{a}{2} < x < \\frac{a}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -\\frac{a}{2} < y < \\frac{a}{2}\n$$\nThis region is an open square centered at the origin with side length $a$.\n\nTo confirm that this square is the complete Wigner-Seitz cell, we must verify that the constraints imposed by all other, more distant, lattice vectors are redundant. Let's consider the next-nearest neighbors. These correspond to the next smallest value of $n_1^2 + n_2^2$, which is $1^2+1^2=2$. This gives four vectors: $(\\pm a, \\pm a)$. Let's analyze the constraint from one of them, for example $\\mathbf{R}_5 = (a, a)$.\nFor this vector, $|\\mathbf{R}_5|^2 = a^2(1^2+1^2) = 2a^2$. The inequality is:\n$$\n2\\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{R}_5 < |\\mathbf{R}_5|^2 \\implies 2(x, y) \\cdot (a, a) < 2a^2 \\implies 2ax + 2ay < 2a^2 \\implies x + y < a\n$$\nWe must check if this new constraint, $x+y < a$, further restricts the square defined by $|x| < a/2$ and $|y| < a/2$. For any point $(x,y)$ within this square, the maximum value of the expression $x+y$ is obtained as $x$ and $y$ approach their upper bounds. We have $x < a/2$ and $y < a/2$, which implies $x+y < a/2 + a/2 = a$. Thus, any point satisfying the constraints from the first-nearest neighbors automatically satisfies the constraint from this next-nearest neighbor. The boundary line $x+y=a$ passes through the corner point $(a/2, a/2)$ of the closed square, but all interior points of the square satisfy $x+y < a$. Therefore, this bisector does not cut into the region already defined. By symmetry, the same conclusion applies to the other next-nearest neighbors $(\\pm a, \\pm a)$ and all farther neighbors.\n\nThe Wigner-Seitz cell is thus the square region defined by the inequalities derived from the four nearest neighbors. The inequalities describing the cell region are:\n$$\n-\\frac{a}{2} < x < \\frac{a}{2}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{a}{2} < y < \\frac{a}{2}\n$$\nThe boundary of the cell consists of the four line segments $x = \\pm a/2$ for $-\\frac{a}{2} \\le y \\le \\frac{a}{2}$ and $y = \\pm a/2$ for $-\\frac{a}{2} \\le x \\le \\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nThe area of this Wigner-Seitz cell, which is a square with side length $s = (\\frac{a}{2}) - (-\\frac{a}{2}) = a$, is given by:\n$$\nA_{\\text{WSC}} = s^2 = a^2\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the general theorem that the area of a primitive unit cell (which the Wigner-Seitz cell is) is equal to the magnitude of the determinant of the matrix formed by the primitive vectors: $A = |\\det(\\mathbf{a}_1, \\mathbf{a}_2)| = \\left| \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 \\\\ 0 & a \\end{pmatrix} \\right| = |a^2| = a^2$.\nThe problem specifies that $a$ is measured in meters, so the area is in square meters.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{a^2}$$", "id": "3020933"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic construction, this exercise explores a more dynamic aspect of the Wigner-Seitz cell.
