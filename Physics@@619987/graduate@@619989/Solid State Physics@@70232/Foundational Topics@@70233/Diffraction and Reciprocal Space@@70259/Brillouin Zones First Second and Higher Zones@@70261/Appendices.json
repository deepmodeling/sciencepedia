Reciprocal Lattice Vectors**\n\nThe primitive real-space lattice vectors are:\n$$\n\\vec{a}_1 = a \\hat{x}, \\quad \\vec{a}_2 = a \\hat{y}\n$$\nThe corresponding reciprocal lattice vectors are:\n$$\n\\vec{b}_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\hat{x}, \\quad \\vec{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\hat{y}\n$$\nThus, any reciprocal lattice vector is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{G} = m \\vec{b}_1 + n \\vec{b}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(m \\hat{x} + n \\hat{y}), \\quad m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **2. First Brillouin Zone (BZ)**\n\nThe first Brillouin zone is the Wigner-Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice centered at the origin. It is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the shortest reciprocal lattice vectors — those with $ |m| = 1, n = 0 $ or $ m = 0, |n| = 1 $. These correspond to:\n$$\n\\vec{G} = \\pm \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\hat{x}, \\quad \\vec{G} = \\pm \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\hat{y}\n$$\nThe perpendicular bisectors between the origin and these $ \\vec{G} $ vectors define the boundaries of the first BZ as:\n$$\nk_x = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{a}, \\quad k_y = \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{a}\n$$\nHence, the first BZ is a square in $ k $-space with vertices at $ (\\pm \\frac{\\pi}{a}, \\pm \\frac{\\pi}{a}) $.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Second Brillouin Zone Construction**\n\nThe second Brillouin zone lies *between* the outer boundary of the first BZ and the boundaries formed by the perpendicular bisectors of the **next-nearest-neighbor** reciprocal lattice vectors. The next-nearest neighbors in the reciprocal lattice are those with $ |m| = 1, |n| = 1 $, i.e., \n$$\n\\vec{G} = \\pm \\frac{2\\pi}{a}(\\hat{x} \\pm \\hat{y})\n$$\nThese have magnitude:\n$$\n|\\vec{G}| = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nThe perpendicular bisector between the origin and such a $ \\vec{G} $ satisfies:\n$$\n|\\vec{k}| = |\\vec{k} - \\vec{G}|\n$$\nSquaring both sides and simplifying gives the equation of the bisector:\n$$\nk_x + k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n$$\nSimilarly, other combinations yield:\n$$\nk_x - k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}, \\quad -k_x + k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}, \\quad -k_x - k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n$$\n\nThese four lines form the outer boundary of the second BZ.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Geometry of the Second Brillouin Zone**\n\nThe second BZ consists of regions that lie **outside** the first BZ but **inside** the bisectors from the next-nearest-neighbor $ \\vec{G} $ vectors. For example, in the region where $ k_x > \\frac{\\pi}{a} $ and $ k_y < \\frac{\\pi}{a} $, the relevant boundary is:\n$$\nk_x + k_y = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n$$\nThis defines a triangular region with vertices at:\n- $ \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{a}, \\frac{\\pi}{a} \\right) $: corner of the first BZ\n- $ \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0 \\right) $: intersection of the bisector with the $ k_x $-axis\n- $ \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{a}, 0 \\right) $: edge of the first BZ\n\nSimilar triangular regions exist in all eight \"directions\" around the first BZ.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Maximum Magnitude in the Second BZ**\n\nTo find the maximum magnitude $ k_{\\text{max}} $, consider the point farthest from the origin within the second BZ. This occurs at the vertex of the triangular region along the $ k_x $-axis:\n$$\n\\vec{k} = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{a}, 0 \\right)\n$$\nIts magnitude is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{max}} = \\left| \\vec{k} \\right| = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n$$\nThis point lies on the outer boundary of the second BZ, defined by the bisector of the next-nearest-neighbor reciprocal lattice vectors. Since the problem specifies the second BZ includes the region **up to** this boundary, this value is valid.\n\nAll other points in the second BZ have smaller magnitudes due to the geometry of the triangular regions.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Final Result**\n\nThus, the maximum possible magnitude of a wavevector $ \\vec{k} $ within the second Brillouin zone is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{a}}\n$$", "id": "45004"}, {"introduction": "Brillouin zones are not just geometric abstractions; they have profound physical consequences, particularly when considering the filling of electronic states.
