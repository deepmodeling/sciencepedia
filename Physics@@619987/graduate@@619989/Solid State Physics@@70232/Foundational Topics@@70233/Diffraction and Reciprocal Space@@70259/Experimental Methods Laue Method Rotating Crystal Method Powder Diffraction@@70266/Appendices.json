This exercise demonstrates how rigorous analysis transforms raw measurements into reliable scientific results.", "problem": "In powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments, systematic errors can lead to inaccuracies in the determination of a crystal's lattice parameters. One of the most significant sources of error is sample displacement, where the sample surface is not precisely on the axis of the goniometer. This error can be corrected for by extrapolating the apparent lattice parameter, calculated from each diffraction peak, to a diffraction angle of $2\\theta = 180^\\circ$ ($\\theta = 90^\\circ$).\n\nA particularly effective method for this extrapolation for cubic crystals is the Nelson-Riley method. It has been shown that the apparent lattice parameter, $a_i$, calculated from a Bragg peak at angle $\\theta_i$, is linearly related to the true lattice parameter, $a_0$, by the following equation:\n$$a_i \\approx a_0 + K f(\\theta_i)$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant proportional to the sample displacement and $f(\\theta_i)$ is the Nelson-Riley function, defined as:\n$$f(\\theta_i) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\cos^2\\theta_i}{\\sin\\theta_i} + \\frac{\\cos^2\\theta_i}{\\theta_i} \\right)$$\n(with $\\theta_i$ in radians).\nThis linear relationship implies that if one plots the apparent lattice parameters $a_i$ against the corresponding values of $f(\\theta_i)$, the data points should fall on a straight line.
