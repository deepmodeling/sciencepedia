The dissociation reaction, for example $\\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0] \\rightarrow \\frac{a}{6}[2\\bar{1}\\bar{1}] + \\frac{a}{6}[1\\bar{2}1]$, is correct for an FCC lattice on a $(111)$ slip plane. The initial dislocation is pure screw, meaning its line direction $\\vec{\\xi}$ is parallel to its Burgers vector $\\vec{b}_{\\text{total}}$. The resulting Shockley partials are of mixed character, specifically $30^{\\circ}$ dislocations, as the angle between their Burgers vectors and the line direction is $30^{\\circ}$. The use of isotropic elasticity is a standard and valid approximation. All necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe equilibrium separation $d$ is established when a balance is achieved between two forces per unit length acting on the partial dislocations: the repulsive elastic force $F_{\\text{repulsive}}/L$ and the attractive force from the stacking fault $F_{\\text{attractive}}/L$.\n\nThe stacking fault creates an energetic penalty proportional to its area. For a segment of length $L$ and width $d$, the energy is $E_{\\mathrm{SF}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{SF}} d L$.

The problem specifies the dissociation of a perfect screw dislocation. Let the total Burgers vector be $\\vec{b}_{\\text{total}}$ with magnitude $b$. The line direction $\\vec{\\xi}$ is parallel to $\\vec{b}_{\\text{total}}$. The dissociation creates two partials with Burgers vectors $\\vec{b}_{1}$ and $\\vec{b}_2$.\nThe relationship between the magnitude of the perfect dislocation's Burgers vector, $b=|\\frac{a}{2}\\langle 110 \\rangle| = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, and the partial's Burgers vector, $b_p=|\\frac{a}{6}\\langle 112 \\rangle| = \\frac{a\\sqrt{6}}{6}$, is $b_p = b/\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe force per unit length between two parallel dislocations separated by a distance $d$ in their slip plane is given by:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\text{repulsive}}}{L} = \\frac{G}{2\\pi d} \\left( b_{s1}b_{s2} + \\frac{\\vec{b}_{e1} \\cdot \\vec{b}_{e2}}{1-\\nu} \\right) $$\nwhere $b_{si}$ is the screw component of the $i$-th partial's Burgers vector and $\\vec{b}_{ei}$ is the edge component vector.\nFor the dissociation of a pure screw dislocation, the screw components of the partials are parallel and their sum equals the total Burgers vector, so $\\vec{b}_{s1}+\\vec{b}_{s2}=\\vec{b}_{\\text{total}}$. The edge components cancel, so $\\vec{b}_{e1}+\\vec{b}_{e2}=0$, which means $\\vec{b}_{e2} = -\\vec{b}_{e1}$. The two partials are identical in character, so $b_{s1}=b_{s2}=b_s$ and $|\\vec{b}_{e1}|=|\\vec{b}_{e2}|=b_e$.\nTherefore, $2b_s = b$, which gives $b_s=b/2$.\nThe angle $\\theta$ between the partial's Burgers vector and the line direction is $30^{\\circ}$.
