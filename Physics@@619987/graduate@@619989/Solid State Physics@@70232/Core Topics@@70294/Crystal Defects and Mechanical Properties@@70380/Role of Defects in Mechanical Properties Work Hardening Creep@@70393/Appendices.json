When a shear stress is applied, dislocations glide on specific crystallographic planes, producing a macroscopic shear strain $\\gamma$. The relationship between an infinitesimal shear strain $d\\gamma$ and the density of mobile dislocations $\\rho$ is given by the Orowan equation in differential form, $d\\gamma = \\rho b dx$, where $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector and $dx$ is the average distance moved by the dislocations perpendicular to their line direction.\n\nDislocation lines are not always perfectly straight. They can contain jogs, which are step-like segments that move the dislocation line from one slip plane to a parallel one. For a screw dislocation, whose line is parallel to its Burgers vector $\\vec{b}$, a jog is a segment with edge character. When the screw dislocation glides, it drags these jogs along. This motion can be non-conservative for the jog (a process called climb), which requires the creation or annihilation of point defects like vacancies or interstitials.\n\nThe creation of a vacancy corresponds to the removal of one atom from the crystal lattice, which has an atomic volume $\\Omega$. The non-conservative motion of a single jog of length $l_j$ by a distance $dx$ is associated with the creation of a number of vacancies proportional to the volume $l_j b dx$. The atomic concentration of vacancies, $c_v$, is defined as the number of vacancies per total number of atomic sites in the crystal. The number of atomic sites per unit volume is $1/\\Omega$.\n\n**Problem:**\n\nA metallic single crystal is plastically deformed at a constant strain rate. The deformation is known to be exclusively carried by the motion of screw dislocations, which have a mobile density $\\rho_s$. These screw dislocations are decorated with jogs. The total density of jogs per unit length of dislocation line is $n_j$. A fraction $\\eta$ of these jogs are sessile, meaning their movement is purely non-conservative. The remaining fraction $(1-\\eta)$ are glissile, and their movement does not generate point defects. All sessile jogs are assumed to have the same length $l_j$. The crystal has a Burgers vector of magnitude $b$ and an atomic volume of $\\Omega$.\n\nCalculate the rate of increase of the atomic concentration of vacancies, $c_v$, per unit increment of shear strain, $\\gamma$.

The primary obstacles to dislocation motion are forest dislocations. The average distance between these obstacles is $L = (\\rho_d)^{-1/2}$.\n3.
