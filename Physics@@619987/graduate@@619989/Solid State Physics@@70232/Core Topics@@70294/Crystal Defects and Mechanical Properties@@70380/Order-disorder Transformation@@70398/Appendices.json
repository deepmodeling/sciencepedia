The B2 structure can be described as a simple cubic lattice with a two-atom basis, or equivalently as two interpenetrating simple cubic sublattices. In a state of perfect order, one sublattice (let's call it $\\alpha$) is occupied exclusively by A atoms, and the other sublattice ($\\beta$) is occupied exclusively by B atoms.
