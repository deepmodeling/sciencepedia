At time $t=0$, the crystal is subjected to a process (e.g., high-energy particle irradiation) that creates a uniform, non-equilibrium concentration $C_0$ of Frenkel defects. A Frenkel defect consists of a vacancy and a nearby self-interstitial atom. For simplicity, we assume that the process creates an equal number of vacancies and interstitials, so their concentrations are always equal: $C_V(t) = C_I(t) = C(t)$.\n\nImmediately after their creation, the crystal's temperature is raised to and maintained at a temperature $T$. At this temperature, the interstitials are mobile with a diffusion coefficient $D$, while the vacancies are considered immobile. The thermal generation of new Frenkel pairs at temperature $T$ is negligible.\n\nThe mobile interstitials diffuse through the lattice. If an interstitial comes within a certain capture radius $r_c$ of a vacancy, the two defects annihilate each other, restoring a perfect lattice site. This annihilation process is diffusion-limited, meaning the overall reaction rate is determined by the rate at which interstitials can diffuse to vacancies.\n\nAssuming the annihilation is a second-order kinetic process, derive an expression for the concentration of Frenkel defects, $C(t)$, as a function of time $t > 0$.
