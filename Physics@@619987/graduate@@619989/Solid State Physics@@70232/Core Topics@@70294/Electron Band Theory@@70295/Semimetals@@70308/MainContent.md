## Introduction
For centuries, our understanding of electronic materials was neatly divided: metals that conduct electricity and insulators that do not. This simple dichotomy, however, overlooks a profound and fascinating class of materials known as semimetals, which challenge these traditional boundaries. These materials represent a new [topological phase](@article_id:145954) of matter where the [electronic bands](@article_id:174841), instead of being separated by an energy gap, touch at discrete points or lines, giving rise to exotic, massless quasiparticles with properties unlike anything in conventional systems. This article bridges the gap between simple classifications and this complex new reality. In the following chapters, we will first explore the fundamental "Principles and Mechanisms" that govern the existence of semimetals, delving into the crucial roles of symmetry and topology. Next, we will survey the remarkable "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," discovering how these theoretical ideas lead to observable phenomena, novel technologies, and surprising links to high-energy physics. Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will provide an opportunity to apply these concepts through targeted problems, solidifying your understanding of this cutting-edge field of [solid-state physics](@article_id:141767).

## Principles and Mechanisms

The scientific exploration of materials can be likened to taking apart a grand clock: observing the components—gears, springs, and hands—to deduce the rules that govern its operation. For a long time, the rules for electrons in crystals seemed fairly simple. They could either live in materials where their energy levels form continuous bands, making a **metal**; or they could face an energy gap they cannot cross, making an **insulator**. A metal conducts electricity, an insulator does not. It seemed a clear-cut division.

But nature, in its infinite subtlety, has hidden some marvelous exceptions in plain sight. What if the [energy bands](@article_id:146082), instead of being separated by a gap, just... touch? What if the "conduction" band, where electrons are free to roam, and the "valence" band, where they are normally stuck, meet at a single point or along a line in the abstract landscape of momentum space? This is not truly a metal, nor an insulator. This is a **semimetal**, and it is the stage for some of the most beautiful and profound physics discovered in recent years.

### The Anatomy of a Touching Point

Imagine you are trying to make two a priori independent functions of three variables, say $f(x,y,z)$ and $g(x,y,z)$, equal to zero at the same time. You have three variables ($x, y, z$) and two equations to satisfy. Generically, the set of solutions will be a line. Now, what if you need to satisfy *three* conditions, say $d_x(k_x, k_y, k_z) = 0$, $d_y(k_x, k_y, k_z) = 0$, and $d_z(k_x, k_y, k_z) = 0$? In the three-dimensional space of electron momentum $\mathbf{k}$, this is like asking three distinct surfaces to intersect. What do you get? Not a line, not a surface, but a set of isolated **points**.

This simple bit of mathematical reasoning is incredibly powerful. The [energy bands](@article_id:146082) of electrons in a simple crystal are described by a $2 \times 2$ matrix Hamiltonian that looks something like $H(\mathbf{k}) = d_0(\mathbf{k})\mathbb{1} + \mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}$, where $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ are the Pauli matrices. A touching, or degeneracy, happens precisely when the vector $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})$ vanishes—that is, when its three components are all zero. So, without any further constraints, band crossings in three dimensions are generically points [@problem_id:3007282]. This is the mathematical birth of the objects at the heart of our story: **Weyl points** and **Dirac points**.

### Symmetry's Decree: The Birth of Dirac and Weyl Points

Now, what’s the difference between a Dirac and a Weyl point? The answer, as it so often is in physics, lies in symmetry. Let’s consider two of the most [fundamental symmetries](@article_id:160762) of the universe: **time-reversal symmetry ($T$)**, which says the laws of physics run the same forwards and backwards in time, and **inversion symmetry ($P$)**, which says the laws look the same if you view the world in a mirror.

What happens if a crystal possesses *both* of these symmetries? The combination of the two, the $PT$ symmetry, acts as a very strict warden. It dictates that every single energy state at a given momentum $\mathbf{k}$ must be at least twofold degenerate [@problem_id:2870328]. This is a form of Kramers' theorem. A simple [band crossing](@article_id:161239), a Weyl point, is a twofold-degenerate point. But crucially, it's *only* degenerate right at the crossing. Move an infinitesimal step away in [momentum space](@article_id:148442), and the bands split. This violates the strict edict of $PT$ symmetry, which demands degeneracy *everywhere*.

So, a crystal with both $P$ and $T$ symmetry simply cannot host a simple Weyl point. To satisfy symmetry, nature must double down. It creates a **fourfold** degenerate crossing—a **Dirac point**. But what *is* a Dirac point? It's not some fundamentally new object. You can think of it as two different Weyl points with opposite properties, forced by symmetry to sit at the exact same point in energy and momentum. They are prisoners, shackled together by the unbreakable chains of $P$ and $T$ symmetry [@problem_id:2870328].

This gives us a wonderful recipe for cooking up a Weyl semimetal. Start with a Dirac semimetal. Now, break the chains! If you can find a way to break *either* [time-reversal symmetry](@article_id:137600) (perhaps with a magnetic field) *or* inversion symmetry (by using a crystal that lacks a center of symmetry), the prisoners are freed [@problem_id:1827852] [@problem_id:2870328]. The single fourfold Dirac point splits into a pair of twofold degenerate Weyl points, which can now move apart in [momentum space](@article_id:148442).

### Momentum-Space Electromagnetism: The Soul of a Weyl Semimetal

We've mentioned that these freed Weyl points have "opposite properties." This property is called **chirality**, and it's a quantized topological charge. A Weyl point can have a [chirality](@article_id:143611) of $\chi=+1$ or $\chi=-1$. A Dirac point is topologically neutral because it's a superposition of a $+1$ and a $-1$ point, for a net charge of zero.

Charge? A charge of what? This isn't electric charge. This is a charge of a more subtle, more abstract field. Living in the momentum space of the crystal is a kind of "fictitious" magnetic field called the **Berry curvature**, $\boldsymbol{\Omega}(\mathbf{k})$. It doesn't point in real space; it points in momentum space. And Weyl points are its sources and sinks! A Weyl point with $\chi=+1$ is a source from which Berry curvature flux emanates, and one with $\chi=-1$ is a sink into which the flux disappears, just like positive and negative electric charges in electromagnetism [@problem_id:1827823]. We can even write down a Gauss's Law for it: the divergence of the Berry curvature is non-zero only at the location of the Weyl points.

This analogy has a stunning consequence. Imagine the entire momentum space of the crystal, the Brillouin Zone. Because of the crystal's periodic lattice structure, this [momentum space](@article_id:148442) is not infinite; it loops back on itself. Topologically, it's a doughnut, or a **torus**—a closed surface with no boundary. Now, what is the total magnetic flux from a collection of monopoles (our Weyl points) through a closed surface that contains them all? From the [divergence theorem](@article_id:144777), it must be zero [@problem_id:2870291].

This leads to the profound **Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem**: the net [chirality](@article_id:143611) of all Weyl points in the entire Brillouin zone must sum to zero [@problem_id:2870291]. You can't have a crystal with just one Weyl point. Nature forbids it. They must always be created in pairs of opposite chirality, a source and a sink, a monopole and an anti-monopole. This "[fermion doubling](@article_id:144288)" is a deep truth rooted in the very periodicity of a crystal lattice.

### Ghosts on the Surface: The Enigma of Fermi Arcs

So what? Electrons live inside the crystal, not in some abstract [momentum space](@article_id:148442). What does this fictitious field and its charges have to do with anything we can measure? The answer appears, quite literally, at the edge of the world—the surface of the crystal.

Let's use a beautiful trick [@problem_id:2870287]. Imagine our 3D [momentum space](@article_id:148442) is a stack of 2D planes, like a deck of cards, parameterized by the momentum component perpendicular to the surface, say $k_z$. For any plane that lies *between* a source ($\chi=+1$) and a sink ($\chi=-1$), there must be a net flux of Berry curvature passing through it. This net flux, when properly calculated, gives an integer called the **Chern number**, $C$. For planes outside the source-sink pair, the net flux is zero, so $C=0$. But for planes in between, $C$ will be a non-zero integer (in our simplest case, $C=1$).

Here's the magic: a 2D system with a non-zero Chern number is a *[topological insulator](@article_id:136609)*, and it is guaranteed by the laws of topology to have a conducting state that lives on its edge. In our picture, the "edge" of the 2D plane is the 1D boundary of our crystal surface.

So, for every value of $k_z$ between our two Weyl points, the surface of the crystal must host a conducting state. String all these states together, and what do you get? A continuous line of conducting states that exists only for $k_z$ values between the Weyl nodes. This is the celebrated **Fermi arc**. It's not a closed loop like the Fermi surface of a normal metal. It's an open arc that terminates where the Weyl points are projected onto the surface, for it is at these points that the [surface states](@article_id:137428) can dive back into the bulk of the crystal and disappear [@problem_id:2870287]. The existence of these strange, incomplete Fermi surfaces is a direct, observable fingerprint of the Weyl monopoles hiding in the bulk.

### A Zoo of Cones: Anisotropy, Tilts, and Lifshitz Transitions

Of course, the simple picture of a perfectly symmetric cone-like dispersion, $E(\mathbf{k}) = \pm \hbar v |\mathbf{k}|$, is an idealization. Real materials are more complex and, frankly, more interesting.

The cone can be **anisotropic**—squashed or stretched along different momentum directions [@problem_id:2870315]. This doesn't change the total topological charge (the flux is still quantized to be $\pm 1$), but it can dramatically change the *distribution* of the Berry curvature. The field becomes stronger in "slow" directions, where the bands are flatter, and weaker in "fast" directions.

Even more dramatically, the entire cone can be tilted over [@problem_id:2870322]. A small tilt doesn't change much; we call this a **Type-I** Weyl semimetal. The [band crossing](@article_id:161239) is still a single point at the Fermi energy. But if the tilt becomes extreme—so extreme that the tilt velocity $|{\mathbf{w}}|$ exceeds the cone's own velocity $v$—something spectacular happens. The cone tips over so far that even at the node energy ($\mu=0$), there are states from both the upper and lower bands that cross this energy. The Fermi "surface" is no longer a single point. It explodes into two open cones, one an electron pocket and one a hole pocket, touching at the Weyl node. This is a **Type-II** Weyl semimetal.

This sudden change in the Fermi surface's topology—from a point (0D) to a surface (2D)—is a classic example of a **Lifshitz transition** [@problem_id:2870322]. This has real consequences. A Type-I Weyl node has zero [density of states](@article_id:147400) (DOS) precisely at the node energy, with the DOS growing as $g(E) \propto |E|^2$ away from it [@problem_id:1827865] [@problem_id:206926]. But a Type-II node, with its finite Fermi surface, has a non-zero [density of states](@article_id:147400) right at the node. They look and behave differently.

### Beyond Points: The Allure of Nodal Lines

Our entire discussion began with the argument that band crossings in 3D are generically points. But we added a crucial caveat: "without any further constraints." What if another symmetry, besides just $P$ and $T$, enters the picture?

Imagine a crystal with a **mirror symmetry**. The states on the mirror plane in the Brillouin zone can be labeled by their mirror eigenvalue. If we consider two bands with *opposite* mirror eigenvalues, the symmetry forbids them from mixing or hybridizing. The only condition for them to cross is for their energies to be equal: $E_1(\mathbf{k}) = E_2(\mathbf{k})$. We started with three conditions, but on this special plane, symmetry has reduced it to just one. One equation in a two-dimensional plane ($k_x, k_y$) doesn't define a point; it defines a **line**.

The result is a **[nodal-line semimetal](@article_id:193051)**, where the valence and conduction bands touch not at isolated points, but along continuous loops or lines in [momentum space](@article_id:148442) [@problem_id:3007282]. These lines are like rings of fire, protected by the crystal's symmetry. They have their own fascinating topology and unique surface states, representing yet another branch in the expanding family of [topological matter](@article_id:160603).

From simple touching points to the grand laws of symmetry, from fictitious fields in momentum space to real, measurable arcs on a crystal surface, the world of semimetals reveals a hidden layer of reality. It's a world governed by topology, where the fundamental properties are robust, quantized, and beautiful. All we had to do was look closely at the places where things were supposed to be simple, and we found a universe of complexity.
