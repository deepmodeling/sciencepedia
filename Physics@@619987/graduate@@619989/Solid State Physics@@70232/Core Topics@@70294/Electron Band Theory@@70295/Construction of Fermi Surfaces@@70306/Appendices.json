The radius of this sphere, the Fermi wavevector $k_F$, is a fundamental property of a metal, as it determines the Fermi energy and other electronic characteristics.\n\nConsider a monovalent metal, meaning each atom contributes a single valence electron to the free electron gas. This metal crystallizes in a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice structure. The conventional unit cell of a BCC lattice is a cube with side length $a$, containing one atom at each of its eight corners and one atom at its center.\n\nAssuming the free electron model is a valid approximation for this metal, determine the radius of the Fermi sphere, $k_F$, expressed in terms of the conventional lattice constant $a$.", "solution": "The radius of the Fermi sphere, $k_F$, is related to the number density of valence electrons, $n$, by the following formula, which we will derive first.\n\nIn the free electron model, the allowed electron wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$ in a crystal of volume $V$ are quantized. Each state, including spin, occupies a volume of $(2\\pi)^3/V$ in k-space. The total number of electron states $N$ within a sphere of radius $k$ in k-space is given by the total volume of the sphere divided by the volume per state.

In k-space, this corresponds to filling all states up to the Fermi wavevector, $k_F$.
