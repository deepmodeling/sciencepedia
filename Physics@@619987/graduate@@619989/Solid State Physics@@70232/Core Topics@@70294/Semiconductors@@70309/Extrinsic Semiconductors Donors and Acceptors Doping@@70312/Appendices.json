It posits that a carrier is captured when it passes near the attractive Coulombic center, loses energy via phonon emission, and becomes trapped in a highly excited state, from which it then cascades down to the ground state.\n\nAssume the following framework based on the Lax model for capture by a single attractive impurity center with charge $+e$:\n1.
