An external electric field, $E$, is applied along the length of the bar, causing the hole pulse to drift towards a detector located at $x=L$. As the pulse drifts, it also spreads out due to diffusion. The entire experiment is conducted at a constant temperature $T$.\n\nThe evolution of the excess hole concentration, $p(x,t)$, is described by the one-dimensional drift-diffusion equation. Neglecting recombination effects (i.e., assuming the hole lifetime is much longer than the travel time), the solution for an initial delta-function pulse is a Gaussian packet.\n\nThe spatial width of the pulse, $W$, is defined as the full width of the concentration profile at $1/e$ of its maximum value. We want to design the experiment such that when the peak of the hole pulse reaches the detector, its spatial width $W$ is a specific fraction $\\alpha$ of the travel distance $L$.\n\nGiven the hole mobility $\\mu_h$, the hole diffusion constant $D_h$, the elementary charge $q$, and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$, determine the required magnitude of the electric field $E$.
