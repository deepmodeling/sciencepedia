In the freeze-out regime at very low temperatures, there is insufficient thermal energy to ionize the donor atoms, so the electron concentration in the conduction band is very low. As the temperature increases, electrons are thermally excited from the donor levels into the conduction band. The problem specifies the criterion for this transition: it occurs when the thermal energy $k_B T$ becomes comparable to the donor binding energy, $E_c - E_D$. This binding energy is the energy required to promote an electron from the donor level $E_D$ to the conduction band edge $E_c$.\n\nThe criterion is given as:\n$$k_B T_1 \\approx E_c - E_D$$\nWe are given the values $E_c - E_D = 5\\,\\mathrm{meV} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_B = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$.

In the extrinsic regime, the carrier concentration is dominated by the ionized donors, so the electron concentration $n$ is approximately equal to the donor concentration $N_D$. As the temperature continues to rise, thermally generated electron-hole pairs become significant. The intrinsic regime begins when the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$, becomes comparable to the dopant concentration. The problem defines this crossover point by the condition:\n$$n_i(T_2) = N_D$$\nTo solve for $T_2$, we must first derive the expression for the intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i(T)$.

This practice extends your understanding to spatially varying systems, which is the foundation for analyzing p-n junctions and transistors. You will investigate a semiconductor with a graded doping profile and derive the resulting internal electric field that arises to maintain equilibrium, demonstrating the crucial balance between carrier diffusion and drift currents. [@problem_id:226119]", "problem": "Consider a semi-infinite n-type semiconductor occupying the region $x > 0$. The semiconductor is non-uniformly doped with a donor concentration profile given by $N_d(x) = \\alpha x$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant. The concentration of acceptor impurities is negligible. The system is maintained in thermal equilibrium at a low temperature $T$, placing it in the *freeze-out* regime.\n\nIn this regime, the following approximations are valid:\n1.  The free electron concentration $n(x)$ is much smaller than the local donor concentration, i.e., $n(x) \\ll N_d(x)$.\n2.  Local charge neutrality holds, which implies that the concentration of ionized donors, $N_d^+(x)$, is approximately equal to the free electron concentration, i.e., $N_d^+(x) \\approx n(x)$.\n\nThe non-uniform distribution of charge carriers gives rise to a diffusion current which, in equilibrium, must be perfectly balanced by a drift current. This balance is sustained by an internal, or built-in, electric field, $E(x)$.\n\nRelevant physical parameters include the elementary charge $q$, the Boltzmann constant $k_B$, the effective density of states in the conduction band $N_c$, the donor ionization energy $\\Delta E_d$, and the donor state degeneracy factor $g_d$. The relationship between the electron diffusion coefficient $D_n$ and mobility $\\mu_n$ is given by the Einstein relation.\n\nDerive a closed-form expression for the built-in electric field $E(x)$ within the semiconductor.
