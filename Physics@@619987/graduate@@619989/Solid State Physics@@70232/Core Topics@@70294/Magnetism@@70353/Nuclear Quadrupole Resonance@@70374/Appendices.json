The interaction of this moment with the local electric field gradient (EFG) gives rise to a set of energy levels, and transitions between these levels can be observed using Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR). The NQR frequency, $\\nu_Q$, is directly proportional to the principal component of the EFG tensor, $V_{zz}$.\n\nIn a particular crystalline solid, the EFG at a specific nuclear site is modeled as the sum of two contributions: an \"ionic\" contribution from the long-range electrostatic field of the lattice ions, and a \"covalent\" contribution from the overlap of electron orbitals with nearest neighbors. The dependence of these contributions on the nearest-neighbor distance, $a$, is given by power laws:\n$$\nV_{zz}^{\\text{ion}}(a) = C_{ion} a^{-3}\n$$\n$$\nV_{zz}^{\\text{cov}}(a) = C_{cov} a^{-n}\n$$\nwhere $C_{ion}$ and $C_{cov}$ are constants and $n$ is a positive real number representing the sensitivity of the covalent bond to distance.
