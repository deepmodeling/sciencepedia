Each atom possesses a spin-1/2 degree of freedom, giving rise to a magnetic moment.

The total magnetic moment of the system along the z-axis is given by the sum $M_z = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mu_{i,z}$, where $\\mu_{i,z}$ is the z-component of the magnetic moment for the $i$-th atom.

The RMS fluctuation is given by $\\Delta M_z = \\sqrt{\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle M_z \\rangle^2}$. We need to compute the thermal averages $\\langle M_z \\rangle$ and $\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle$.\n\n**1. Statistical model of a single spin at zero field**\n\nThe energy of a single magnetic moment in an external magnetic field $B$ along the z-axis is $E = -\\mu_z B$. In this problem, the external field is zero, $B=0$. Thus, the energy is zero regardless of whether the spin is \"up\" ($\\mu_z = +\\mu$) or \"down\" ($\\mu_z = -\\mu$).\n$E_+ = -\\mu B = 0$\n$E_- = -(-\\mu) B = 0$\n\nThe system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$. The probability of finding a spin in a particular state is given by the Boltzmann factor $e^{-E/(k_B T)}$. The partition function for a single spin, $Z_1$, is the sum of these factors over all possible states:\n$$\nZ_1 = e^{-E_+/(k_B T)} + e^{-E_-/(k_B T)} = e^0 + e^0 = 2\n$$\nThe probability $p_+$ of a single spin having $\\mu_z = +\\mu$ is:\n$$\np_+ = \\frac{e^{-E_+/(k_B T)}}{Z_1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nAnd the probability $p_-$ of a single spin having $\\mu_z = -\\mu$ is:\n$$\np_- = \\frac{e^{-E_-/(k_B T)}}{Z_1} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe two states are equally likely, which is expected by symmetry in zero field. Note that these probabilities are independent of the temperature $T$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the average total magnetic moment $\\langle M_z \\rangle$**\n\nThe total magnetic moment is $M_z = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mu_{i,z}$. By the linearity of the expectation value, its thermal average is:\n$$\n\\langle M_z \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mu_{i,z} \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\langle \\mu_{i,z} \\rangle\n$$\nFor any single spin $i$, the average magnetic moment is:\n$$\n\\langle \\mu_{i,z} \\rangle = (+\\mu) p_+ + (-\\mu) p_- = \\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the average total magnetic moment is:\n$$\n\\langle M_z \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^N 0 = 0\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the mean square total magnetic moment $\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle$**\n\nNext, we compute the thermal average of the square of the total magnetic moment:\n$$\n\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mu_{i,z}\\right)^2 \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mu_{i,z}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^N \\mu_{j,z}\\right) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nExpanding the product gives:\n$$\n\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mu_{i,z} \\mu_{j,z} \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mu_{i,z}^2 + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mu_{i,z} \\mu_{j,z} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation value again:\n$$\n\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\langle \\mu_{i,z}^2 \\rangle + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\langle \\mu_{i,z} \\mu_{j,z} \\rangle\n$$\nThe atoms are non-interacting, which means their magnetic moments are statistically independent. For any pair of distinct atoms $i \\neq j$, the average of the product of their moments is the product of their averages:\n$$\n\\langle \\mu_{i,z} \\mu_{j,z} \\rangle = \\langle \\mu_{i,z} \\rangle \\langle \\mu_{j,z} \\rangle\n$$\nSince we found $\\langle \\mu_{i,z} \\rangle = 0$ for all $i$, this cross-term vanishes:\n$$\n\\langle \\mu_{i,z} \\mu_{j,z} \\rangle = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\neq j\n$$\nThus, the sum over $i \\neq j$ is zero, and we are left with:\n$$\n\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\langle \\mu_{i,z}^2 \\rangle\n$$\nNow we compute the mean square magnetic moment for a single spin:\n$$\n\\langle \\mu_z^2 \\rangle = (+\\mu)^2 p_+ + (-\\mu)^2 p_- = \\mu^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\mu^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\mu^2\n$$\nSince all spins are identical, $\\langle \\mu_{i,z}^2 \\rangle = \\mu^2$ for all $i$. Substituting this into the sum:\n$$\n\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mu^2 = N \\mu^2\n$$\n\n**4. Calculation of the RMS fluctuation $\\Delta M_z$**\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the RMS fluctuation:\n$$\n\\Delta M_z = \\sqrt{\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle - \\langle M_z \\rangle^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values $\\langle M_z^2 \\rangle = N \\mu^2$ and $\\langle M_z \\rangle = 0$:\n$$\n\\Delta M_z = \\sqrt{N \\mu^2 - 0^2} = \\sqrt{N \\mu^2}\n$$\nSince $\\mu$ is a positive constant, we have:\n$$\n\\Delta M_z = \\mu \\sqrt{N}\n$$\nThe RMS fluctuation of the total magnetic moment is proportional to the square root of the number of atoms, a characteristic result for the sum of independent random variables.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\mu \\sqrt{N}} $$", "id": "174242"}, {"introduction": "While the simple model of isolated spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles provides the foundation of Curie paramagnetism, real materials often possess more complex energy-level structures.
