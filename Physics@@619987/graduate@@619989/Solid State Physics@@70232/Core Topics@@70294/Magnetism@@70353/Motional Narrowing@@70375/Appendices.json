Consider a pair of protons (spin-1/2 nuclei) in a water molecule of crystallization.

The energy difference between these states, $E_0 = \\hbar\\omega_0$, determines the frequency of emitted photons during photoluminescence (PL).\n\nThe QD is embedded in a host material, which causes the transition energy to fluctuate in time. This fluctuation can be modeled as arising from a large number, $N$, of identical and uncorrelated Random Telegraph Fluctuators (RTFs).
