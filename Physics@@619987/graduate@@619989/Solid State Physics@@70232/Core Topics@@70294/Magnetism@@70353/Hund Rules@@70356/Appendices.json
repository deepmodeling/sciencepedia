These rules determine how electrons occupy orbitals in a subshell, leading to the ground state with the lowest energy. The first rule, the rule of maximum multiplicity, states that the term with the maximum total spin quantum number $S$ has the lowest energy.\n\nThe magnetic properties of an ion are closely related to its total electron spin. For many transition metal ions, the orbital angular momentum is effectively \"quenched\" by the surrounding crystal field, and the effective magnetic moment, $\\mu_{eff}$, can be well approximated by the \"spin-only\" formula:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = g_s \\sqrt{S(S+1)} \\mu_B $$\nwhere $S$ is the total spin quantum number of the ion, $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton, and $g_s$ is the electron spin g-factor.

The electron configuration of a neutral $\\text{Mn}$ atom is:\n$$ 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^5 $$\nAlternatively, this can be written using the noble gas core notation as $[\\text{Ar}] 4s^2 3d^5$.\n\nThe $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$ ion is formed by removing two electrons from the neutral $\\text{Mn}$ atom.

In this case, the two electrons are removed from the $4s$ orbital.\n\nTherefore, the electron configuration of the $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$ ion is:\n$$ [\\text{Ar}] 3d^5 $$\nThis means the $\\text{Mn}^{2+}$ ion has five electrons in its $3d$ subshell.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Hund's rules to find the total spin $S$.**\nThe $3d$ subshell has five orbitals, corresponding to the magnetic quantum numbers $m_l = -2, -1, 0, +1, +2$. We need to place the five $3d$ electrons into these orbitals.\n\nHund's first rule (the rule of maximum multiplicity) states that the ground state is achieved by maximizing the total spin $S$. This is done by placing electrons into separate orbitals with parallel spins before any pairing occurs.\n\nFor the $3d^5$ configuration, we can place one electron in each of the five available $d$-orbitals. To maximize the total spin, all five electrons must have the same spin projection, for example, $m_s = +1/2$.\n\nThe total spin quantum number $S$ is the sum of the spin quantum numbers of the individual electrons:\n$$ S = \\sum m_s = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 5 \\times \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ S = \\frac{5}{2} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the spin-only effective magnetic moment.**\nThe formula for the spin-only effective magnetic moment is given as:\n$$ \\mu_{eff} = g_s \\sqrt{S(S+1)} \\mu_B $$\nWe are given the approximation $g_s = 2$.
