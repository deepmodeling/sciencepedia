Thus, the initial state for all particles is $\\vec{M} = M_s \\hat{z}$.\n\nWhen the external field is reduced to zero, the only energy term is the anisotropy energy, $u_A = K\\sin^2\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\vec{M}$ and the particle's easy axis. This energy is minimized when $\\vec{M}$ is aligned with the easy axis ($\\theta=0$ or $\\theta=\\pi$). Each particle's magnetization will relax to one of these two minimum energy states. The system will choose the state that is closest to the initial, saturated-state magnetization direction ($\\hat{z}$).\n\nLet the easy axis of a particular particle be described by a unit vector $\\hat{n}$, which makes a polar angle $\\alpha$ with the $z$-axis. The two energy minima correspond to $\\vec{M} = M_s \\hat{n}$ and $\\vec{M} = -M_s \\hat{n}$.
