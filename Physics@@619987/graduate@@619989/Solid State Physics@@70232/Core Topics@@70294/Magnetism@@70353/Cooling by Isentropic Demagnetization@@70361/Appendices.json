The salt contains a large number, $N$, of non-interacting magnetic ions, each with total angular momentum quantum number $J$. The total entropy of the salt, $S$, is the sum of the lattice entropy, $S_L$, and the magnetic entropy, $S_m$.\n\nIn a certain low-temperature regime, the lattice heat capacity is well described by $C_L = aT^3$, where $a$ is a constant. The magnetic ions experience both the external magnetic field, $B$, and a small, constant internal field, $b$, which arises from interactions between the ions. For temperatures high enough such that the thermal energy is much larger than the magnetic energy splitting ($k_B T \\gg g\\mu_B \\sqrt{B^2+b^2}$), the magnetic entropy can be approximated as\n$$S_m(T, B) \\approx N k_B \\ln(2J+1) - \\frac{C(B^2 + b^2)}{2T^2}$$\nwhere $C$ is the material's Curie constant and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nA sample of this salt is initially in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T_i$ and in a strong external magnetic field $B_i$.

The problem states that the lattice contribution to the entropy can be considered negligible. Therefore, we only need to consider the magnetic entropy, $S_{tot} \\approx S_m$.\n\nThe expression for the magnetic entropy in the high-temperature approximation is given as:\n$$S_m(T, B) = N k_B \\ln(2J+1) - \\frac{C(B^2 + b^2)}{2T^2}$$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $B$ is the external magnetic field, $b$ is the constant internal field, $C$ is the Curie constant, $N$ is the number of magnetic ions, $J$ is the angular momentum quantum number, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe process of adiabatic demagnetization is carried out while the sample is thermally isolated. A slow change in the magnetic field ensures the process is reversible. Therefore, the process is isentropic, which means the total entropy of the system remains constant.\n\nLet the initial state of the system be characterized by $(T_i, B_i)$ and the final state by $(T_f, B_f)$. The condition for an isentropic process is:\n$$S(T_i, B_i) = S(T_f, B_f)$$\n\nUsing the given approximation for the magnetic entropy, we can write the entropy for the initial and final states:\nInitial entropy:\n$$S(T_i, B_i) = N k_B \\ln(2J+1) - \\frac{C(B_i^2 + b^2)}{2T_i^2}$$\nFinal entropy:\n$$S(T_f, B_f) = N k_B \\ln(2J+1) - \\frac{C(B_f^2 + b^2)}{2T_f^2}$$\n\nNow, we set the initial and final entropies equal to each other:\n$$N k_B \\ln(2J+1) - \\frac{C(B_i^2 + b^2)}{2T_i^2} = N k_B \\ln(2J+1) - \\frac{C(B_f^2 + b^2)}{2T_f^2}$$\n\nThe term $N k_B \\ln(2J+1)$, which represents the maximum entropy of the spin system, is constant and can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n$$-\\frac{C(B_i^2 + b^2)}{2T_i^2} = -\\frac{C(B_f^2 + b^2)}{2T_f^2}$$\n\nWe can cancel the common factor of $-C/2$ from both sides:\n$$\\frac{B_i^2 + b^2}{T_i^2} = \\frac{B_f^2 + b^2}{T_f^2}$$\n\nOur goal is to solve for the final temperature, $T_f$.
