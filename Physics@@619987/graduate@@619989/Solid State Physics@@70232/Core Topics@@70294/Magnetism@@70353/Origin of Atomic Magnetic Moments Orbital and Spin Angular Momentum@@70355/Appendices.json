The electronic state of a multi-electron ion is often summarized by a term symbol of the form $^{2S+1}L_J$. In this notation, $S$ is the total spin angular momentum quantum number, $L$ is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number. For a given total angular momentum quantum number $L$, the spectroscopic notation uses letters: S, P, D, F, G, H, I, K, ... for $L=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ...$ respectively.\n\nThe ground state term symbol for an ion with a partially filled electron subshell is determined by applying Hund's Rules in sequence:\n1.  **Rule 1 (Maximum Spin):** The electron configuration in the orbitals is the one that maximizes the total spin quantum number, $S = |\\sum m_s|$.\n2.  **Rule 2 (Maximum Orbital Angular Momentum):** For the value of $S$ determined from Rule 1, the configuration is the one that maximizes the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L = |\\sum m_l|$.\n3.  **Rule 3 (Total Angular Momentum):** The total angular momentum quantum number $J$ is determined by the values of $L$ and $S$.\n    -   If the subshell is less than half-full, $J = |L - S|$.\n    -   If the subshell is more than half-full, $J = L + S$.\n    -   If the subshell is exactly half-full, $L=0$ and thus $J = S$.\n\nConsider a free Holmium ion, Ho$^{3+}$, which has an outer electron configuration of $4f^{10}$. The $f$ subshell is characterized by an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=3$. The maximum number of electrons this subshell can accommodate is $2(2l+1)$.\n\nUsing Hund's rules, determine the numerical value of the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$, for the ground state of the Ho$^{3+}$ ion.", "solution": "The Ho$^{3+}$ ion has an outer electron configuration of $4f^{10}$. The $f$ subshell has orbital angular momentum quantum number $l = 3$, and a maximum capacity of $2(2l + 1) = 14$ electrons. Since $10 > 7$ (half of 14), the subshell is more than half-full.\n\n**Hund's Rule 1 (Maximize Spin):**  \nTo maximize the total spin $S$, we place as many electrons as possible with parallel spins. In a $4f$ subshell (7 orbitals), we can place 7 electrons with spin up ($m_s = +1/2$). The remaining $10-7=3$ electrons must have spin down ($m_s = -1/2$). This gives a total spin projection of $M_S = 7 \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) + 3 \\times (-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{7}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2$. Thus, the total spin quantum number is $S = 2$.\n\n**Hund's Rule 2 (Maximize Orbital Angular Momentum):**  \nFor the configuration with maximum $S$, we arrange the electrons to maximize the total orbital angular momentum projection, $M_L = \\sum m_l$. The 7 spin-up electrons fill all available orbitals ($m_l = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$), so their contribution to $M_L$ is zero. The 3 spin-down electrons are then placed in the orbitals with the highest possible $m_l$ values to maximize the total $M_L$. These are the orbitals with $m_l = 3, 2, 1$. The total orbital projection is the sum of contributions from all electrons:\n$$M_L = (3+2+1+0-1-2-3)_{\\text{spin up}} + (3+2+1)_{\\text{spin down}} = 0 + 6 = 6.$$\nThus, the total orbital angular momentum quantum number is $L = 6$.\n\n**Hund's Rule 3 (Total Angular Momentum):**  \nSince the subshell is more than half-full ($10 > 7$), the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ is given by the sum:\n$$J = L + S = 6 + 2 = 8.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "171870"}, {"introduction": "Once the quantum numbers $L$ and $S$ are known, we can explore the fundamental interaction that couples them: spin-orbit coupling.
