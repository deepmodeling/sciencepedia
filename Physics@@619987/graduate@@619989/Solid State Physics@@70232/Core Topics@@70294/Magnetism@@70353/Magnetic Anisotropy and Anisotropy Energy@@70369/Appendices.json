Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $K_1/K_2$. From the energy equality condition, we have:\n$$ \\frac{K_1}{K_2} = -1 $$\nThis result is consistent with the stability conditions derived earlier. If $K_1/K_2 = -1$, then $K_1 = -K_2$. The stability condition $K_1 > 0$ requires $-K_2 > 0$, or $K_2 < 0$. The second stability condition $K_1 + 2K_2 < 0$ becomes $-K_2 + 2K_2 = K_2 < 0$. Both are satisfied if $K_2$ is negative.
