The second equation implies the existence of a scalar potential $\\Phi$ such that the electric field is given by its negative gradient, $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\Phi$. Substituting this into the first equation along with the linear constitutive relation $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$ (where $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the medium), we obtain $\\nabla \\cdot (\\epsilon \\mathbf{E}) = \\nabla \\cdot (-\\epsilon \\nabla \\Phi) = 0$.

This requires that all coefficients of the terms singular at the origin, $B_l$, must be zero. Thus, the interior potential has the form:\n$$ \\Phi_{in}(r, \\theta) = \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} A_l r^l P_l(\\cos\\theta) $$\n\nFor the region outside the sphere ($r > R$), the potential $\\Phi_{out}$ must approach the potential of the uniform external field as $r \\to \\infty$. The potential corresponding to $\\mathbf{E}_0 = E_0 \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is $\\Phi_0 = -E_0 z = -E_0 r \\cos\\theta = -E_0 r P_1(\\cos\\theta)$.
