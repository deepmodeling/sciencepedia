We are asked to find the polaron binding energy in the atomic limit, where the electron hopping is negligible and the electron is pinned to a single site.\n\nFirst, we establish the relevant Hamiltonian based on the problem's constraints. The full Hamiltonian is given as:\n$$\nH = -t \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\left( c_{i}^{\\dagger} c_{j} + c_{j}^{\\dagger} c_{i} \\right) + \\omega_0 \\sum_{i} b_{i}^{\\dagger} b_{i} + g \\sum_{i} n_{i} \\left( b_{i} + b_{i}^{\\dagger} \\right)\n$$\nWe are instructed to ignore the hopping term, which corresponds to setting the hopping parameter $t=0$. Furthermore, a single electron is pinned at a specific site $j$. This implies that the electron number operator $n_{i} = c_{i}^{\\dagger} c_{i}$ has the eigenvalue $1$ for site $i=j$ and $0$ for all other sites, i.e., $n_{j}=1$ and $n_{i \\neq j}=0$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the Hamiltonian simplifies significantly. The hopping term vanishes. The electron-phonon interaction term $g \\sum_{i} n_{i} (b_{i} + b_{i}^{\\dagger})$ becomes $g n_{j} (b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger}) = g (1) (b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger})$. The phonons on sites $i \\neq j$ are completely decoupled from the electron and from the phonon at site $j$. Their Hamiltonian is simply $\\omega_0 \\sum_{i \\neq j} b_{i}^{\\dagger} b_{i}$. The ground state of these decoupled phonons has zero energy. Therefore, to find the energy lowering due to the interaction, we only need to consider the part of the Hamiltonian involving site $j$:\n$$\nH_j = \\omega_0 b_{j}^{\\dagger} b_{j} + g \\left( b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger} \\right)\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian describes a quantum harmonic oscillator perturbed by a term linear in the creation and annihilation operators, which represents the force exerted by the electron on the lattice at site $j$.\n\nTo find the ground state energy, we apply a unitary displacement transformation, also known as a Lang-Firsov transformation, to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. Let the unitary operator be $U = \\exp(S)$, where $S$ is an anti-Hermitian operator. We choose $S = \\lambda (b_{j}^{\\dagger} - b_{j})$ where $\\lambda$ is a real constant to be determined. The transformed Hamiltonian is $\\tilde{H}_{j} = U H_{j} U^{\\dagger}$. To calculate this, we first find how the operators $b_{j}$ and $b_{j}^{\\dagger}$ transform:\n$$\n\\tilde{b}_{j} = U b_{j} U^{\\dagger} = e^S b_j e^{-S}\n$$\nUsing the Baker-Hausdorff lemma, $e^A B e^{-A} = B + [A,B] + \\frac{1}{2!}[A,[A,B]] + \\dots$, with $A=S$ and $B=b_j$:\nThe first commutator is $[S, b_{j}] = [\\lambda(b_{j}^{\\dagger}-b_{j}), b_{j}] = \\lambda [b_{j}^{\\dagger}, b_{j}] = -\\lambda$, using the bosonic commutation relation $[b_{j}, b_{j}^{\\dagger}]=1$.\nThe next commutator is $[S, [S, b_{j}]] = [S, -\\lambda] = 0$. Thus, the series terminates.\nThe transformed annihilation operator is:\n$$\n\\tilde{b}_{j} = b_{j} + [S, b_{j}] = b_{j} - \\lambda\n$$\nSimilarly, for the creation operator $b_{j}^{\\dagger}$:\n$$\n[S, b_{j}^{\\dagger}] = [\\lambda(b_{j}^{\\dagger}-b_{j}), b_{j}^{\\dagger}] = -\\lambda [b_{j}, b_{j}^{\\dagger}] = -\\lambda\n$$\nSo the transformed creation operator is:\n$$\n\\tilde{b}_{j}^{\\dagger} = U b_{j}^{\\dagger} U^{\\dagger} = b_{j}^{\\dagger} + [S, b_{j}^{\\dagger}] = b_{j}^{\\dagger} - \\lambda\n$$\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for the transformed Hamiltonian:\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = U (\\omega_0 b_{j}^{\\dagger} b_{j} + g (b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger})) U^{\\dagger} = \\omega_0 (U b_{j}^{\\dagger} U^{\\dagger})(U b_{j} U^{\\dagger}) + g (U b_{j} U^{\\dagger} + U b_{j}^{\\dagger} U^{\\dagger})\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_0 (b_{j}^{\\dagger} - \\lambda)(b_{j} - \\lambda) + g ((b_{j} - \\lambda) + (b_{j}^{\\dagger} - \\lambda))\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_0 (b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} - \\lambda b_{j}^{\\dagger} - \\lambda b_{j} + \\lambda^2) + g (b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger} - 2\\lambda)\n$$\nGrouping terms, we get:\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_0 b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} + (g - \\omega_0\\lambda)b_{j}^{\\dagger} + (g - \\omega_0\\lambda)b_{j} + \\omega_0\\lambda^2 - 2g\\lambda\n$$\nThe purpose of the transformation is to eliminate the linear coupling terms. We achieve this by choosing $\\lambda$ such that the coefficients of $b_{j}$ and $b_{j}^{\\dagger}$ are zero:\n$$\ng - \\omega_0\\lambda = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda = \\frac{g}{\\omega_0}\n$$\nWith this choice of $\\lambda$, the transformed Hamiltonian becomes diagonal in the phonon number operator:\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_0 b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} + \\omega_0 \\left(\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}\\right)^2 - 2g\\left(\\frac{g}{\\omega_0}\\right) = \\omega_0 b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} + \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0} - \\frac{2g^2}{\\omega_0}\n$$\n$$\n\\tilde{H}_{j} = \\omega_0 b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j} - \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}\n$$\nThis is the Hamiltonian of an unperturbed harmonic oscillator shifted by a constant energy. The ground state of this Hamiltonian is the phonon vacuum $|0\\rangle_{j}$, for which $b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j}|0\\rangle_{j} = 0$. The ground-state energy of $\\tilde{H}_{j}$ is therefore $E_{g.s.}^{\\text{transformed}} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}$.\nSince $H_{j}$ and $\\tilde{H}_{j}$ are related by a unitary transformation, they share the same eigenvalue spectrum. Thus, the ground-state energy of the original interacting Hamiltonian $H_{j}$ is $E_{g.s.} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}$.\n\nThe problem defines the polaron binding energy $E_p$ as the magnitude of the ground-state energy lowering caused by the electron-phonon interaction. To find this lowering, we compare the ground-state energy of the interacting system ($g \\neq 0$) with that of the non-interacting system ($g=0$).\nFor $g=0$, the Hamiltonian is $H_{j, g=0} = \\omega_0 b_{j}^{\\dagger}b_{j}$, whose ground-state energy is $0$.\nThe energy lowering is $\\Delta E = E_{g.s.} - E_{g.s., g=0} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0} - 0 = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}$.\nThe polaron binding energy is the magnitude of this value:\n$$\nE_p = |\\Delta E| = \\left| -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0} \\right| = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}\n$$\n\nTo justify this result, we relate it to a classical displaced harmonic oscillator. We can express the phonon operators in terms of dimensionless position and momentum operators, $q_{j} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(b_{j} + b_{j}^{\\dagger})$ and $p_{j} = \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(b_{j}^{\\dagger} - b_{j})$, which satisfy $[q_j, p_j]=i$. The Hamiltonian $H_{j}$ (ignoring the constant zero-point energy term) becomes:\n$$\nH_j = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2}(p_{j}^{2} + q_{j}^{2}) + g\\sqrt{2} q_{j}\n$$\nThe potential energy of the oscillator is $V(q_{j}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 q_{j}^{2} + g\\sqrt{2} q_{j}$. This describes a harmonic potential $\\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0 q_{j}^{2}$ subjected to a constant force $F = -g\\sqrt{2}$ from the electron. The minimum of this potential corresponds to the new equilibrium position of the oscillator. We find it by setting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dq_{j}} = \\omega_0 q_{j} + g\\sqrt{2} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad q_{j, \\text{eq}} = -\\frac{g\\sqrt{2}}{\\omega_0}\n$$\nThe energy at this new equilibrium displacement is the minimum potential energy:\n$$\nV_{\\text{min}} = V(q_{j, \\text{eq}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\\left(-\\frac{g\\sqrt{2}}{\\omega_0}\\right)^2 + g\\sqrt{2}\\left(-\\frac{g\\sqrt{2}}{\\omega_0}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_0\\left(\\frac{2g^2}{\\omega_0^2}\\right) - \\frac{2g^2}{\\omega_0} = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0} - \\frac{2g^2}{\\omega_0} = -\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}\n$$\nThis minimum potential energy is precisely the value of the ground-state energy shift we calculated quantum mechanically. It represents the energy stored in the static deformation of the lattice caused by the presence of the electron. This \"lattice deformation energy\" is released when the polaron forms, binding the electron to its own polarization cloud. The magnitude of this energy is the polaron binding energy, $E_p = |V_{\\text{min}}| = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}$, confirming our previous result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{g^2}{\\omega_0}}$$", "id": "3010648"}, {"introduction": "Having grasped the formation of a single polaron, we can explore more complex scenarios.

This composite quasi-particle, consisting of the electron and its associated lattice distortion, is known as a small polaron.

Relative to a free electron in an undistorted lattice (energy set to zero), a single polaron has an energy of $-E_p$.\n\nIt is sometimes energetically favorable for two such polarons to bind together to form a small bipolaron, where two electrons are localized at the same site, sharing a common, larger lattice distortion. The formation of such a state is hindered by the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U > 0$ between the two electrons.\n\nTo model this, we consider a simplified picture. The energy of the local lattice distortion is described by a single generalized coordinate $q$ as $E_{lat} = \\frac{1}{2} C q^2$, where $C$ is an effective elastic constant. The interaction energy between a single electron localized at that site and the distortion is $E_{int,1} = -g q$, where $g$ is the electron-lattice coupling constant.

The unperturbed ground state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ consists of an electron at rest (momentum $\\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{0}$, thus wavevector $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$) and the phonon system in its vacuum state $|0\\rangle_{\\text{ph}}$. So, $|\\psi_0\\rangle = |\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}\\rangle|0\\rangle_{\\text{ph}}$. The unperturbed ground-state energy, ignoring the constant phonon zero-point energy, is $E_0 = 0$.\n\nThe first-order energy correction is $\\Delta E^{(1)} = \\langle \\psi_0 | H_{\\text{int}} | \\psi_0 \\rangle$. The interaction Hamiltonian contains terms with a single phonon operator $b_{\\mathbf{q}}$ or $b_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\dagger}$. The expectation value of these operators in the phonon vacuum state is zero: $\\langle 0 | b_{\\mathbf{q}} | 0 \\rangle_{\\text{ph}} = 0$ and $\\langle 0 | b_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\dagger} | 0 \\rangle_{\\text{ph}} = 0$. Thus, the first-order energy shift is zero.\n$$\\Delta E^{(1)} = 0$$\nThe leading contribution to the energy shift comes from second-order perturbation theory:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{weak}} \\approx \\Delta E^{(2)} = \\sum_{n \\neq 0} \\frac{|\\langle \\psi_n | H_{\\text{int}} | \\psi_0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0 - E_n}$$\nThe intermediate states $|\\psi_n\\rangle$ must have a non-zero matrix element with $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ via $H_{\\text{int}}$. The term in $H_{\\text{int}}$ containing $b_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\dagger}$ creates a phonon of wavevector $\\mathbf{q}$. By momentum conservation, the electron must recoil with momentum $-\\hbar\\mathbf{q}$ (wavevector $-\\mathbf{q}$). Thus, the relevant intermediate states are one-phonon states of the form $|\\psi_n\\rangle = |\\mathbf{k}=-\\mathbf{q}\\rangle|1_{\\mathbf{q}}\\rangle$. The term with $b_{\\mathbf{q}}$ annihilates a phonon and cannot connect the ground state to any other state, as the ground state has no phonons.\n\nThe energy of an intermediate state is the sum of the electron's kinetic energy and the phonon's energy: $E_n = \\frac{(\\hbar q)^2}{2m} + \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$. The energy denominator is $E_0 - E_n = -\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m} + \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}\\right)$.

The electronic part of the matrix element is $\\langle -\\mathbf{q} | \\exp(-i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}) | \\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0} \\rangle = 1$ due to momentum conservation (the operator $\\exp(-i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})$ imparts momentum $\\hbar\\mathbf{q}$), and the phonon part is $\\langle 1_{\\mathbf{q}} | b_{\\mathbf{q}}^{\\dagger} | 0 \\rangle = 1$. The matrix element is therefore $V_{\\mathbf{q}}^*$.\n\nThe energy shift is the sum over all possible intermediate one-phonon states (i.e., all $\\mathbf{q}$):\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{weak}} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\frac{|V_{\\mathbf{q}}^*|^2}{-\\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m} + \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}\\right)} = - \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\frac{|V_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2}{\\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m} + \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}}$$\nThe problem states that $|V_{\\mathbf{q}}|$ scales as $\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ times an energy scale set by $\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$.

We define this constant as $a$:\n$$a = \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\frac{f(\\mathbf{q})}{1 + \\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}}}$$\nSince $f(\\mathbf{q})=|V_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 / (\\alpha (\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}})^2)$ is non-negative and the denominator is positive definite, $a > 0$. The ground-state energy shift thus scales as:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{weak}}(\\alpha) = - a \\alpha \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$$\nThis justifies the scaling structure and the negative sign for the weak-coupling limit.\n\nNext, we address the strong-coupling limit, as requested in part 2.\nIn the strong-coupling limit ($\\alpha \\gg 1$), the electron is self-trapped in a potential well it creates by polarizing the surrounding lattice. This situation is well-described by the adiabatic (Born-Oppenheimer) approximation, where the lattice is assumed to respond instantaneously to the electron's position. We use a variational approach. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian in a trial state $|\\Psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle_{\\text{el}}|\\phi\\rangle_{\\text{ph}}$ is minimized. In the adiabatic limit, the phonons are treated as classical oscillators displaced by the electron's presence. The minimal-energy state for phonons is a coherent state, where the expectation value of the annihilation operator is $\\langle b_{\\mathbf{q}} \\rangle = \\beta_{\\mathbf{q}}$. Minimizing the energy functional with respect to $\\beta_{\\mathbf{q}}$ yields $\\beta_{\\mathbf{q}} = -V_{\\mathbf{q}} \\rho_{\\mathbf{q}} / (\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}})$, where $\\rho_{\\mathbf{q}} = \\langle \\psi | \\exp(i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}) | \\psi \\rangle$ is the Fourier transform of the electron density. Substituting this back into the energy expectation value gives an effective energy functional for the electron:\n$$E[\\psi] = \\langle \\psi | \\frac{\\mathbf{p}^2}{2m} | \\psi \\rangle - \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\frac{|V_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 |\\rho_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2}{\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}}$$\nWe now use a scaling argument to find the dependence of the minimized energy on $\\alpha$. Let's assume a trial wavefunction for the localized electron of the form $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = L^{-3/2}\\phi(\\mathbf{r}/L)$, where $L$ is a variational parameter representing the size of the polaron and $\\phi$ is a normalized dimensionless function.\n\nThe kinetic energy term scales as:\n$$E_{\\text{kin}} = \\langle \\psi | \\frac{-\\hbar^2\\nabla^2}{2m} | \\psi \\rangle \\propto \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m L^2}$$\nThe potential energy term requires analyzing the scaling of $\\rho_{\\mathbf{q}}$:\n$$\\rho_{\\mathbf{q}} = \\int d^3r \\frac{1}{L^3}|\\phi(\\mathbf{r}/L)|^2 \\exp(i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}) = \\int d^3x |\\phi(\\mathbf{x})|^2 \\exp(i(\\mathbf{q}L)\\cdot\\mathbf{x})$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{r}/L$. Thus, $\\rho_{\\mathbf{q}}$ depends only on the product $\\mathbf{q}L$. Let's call this function $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{q}L)$.\nThe potential energy is $E_{\\text{pot}} = - \\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\frac{|V_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 |\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{q}L)|^2}{\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}}$.\nUsing $|V_{\\mathbf{q}}|^2 \\propto \\alpha/q^2$, which is the specific form for Fröhlich coupling, and converting the sum to an integral $\\sum_{\\mathbf{q}} \\to \\frac{\\mathcal{V}}{(2\\pi)^3}\\int d^3q$ (where $\\mathcal{V}$ is volume):\n$$E_{\\text{pot}} \\propto -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}} \\int \\frac{|\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{q}L)|^2}{q^2} d^3q$$\nLet's change variables to $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{q}L$, so $q=k/L$ and $d^3q = L^{-3}d^3k$.\n$$E_{\\text{pot}} \\propto -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}} \\int \\frac{|\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{k})|^2}{(k/L)^2} L^{-3}d^3k = -\\frac{\\alpha}{L\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}}\\int \\frac{|\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{k})|^2}{k^2}d^3k \\propto -\\frac{\\alpha}{L}$$\nThe total energy as a function of $L$ is of the form:\n$$E(L) = \\frac{C_1}{L^2} - \\frac{C_2\\alpha}{L}$$\nwhere $C_1  0$ and $C_2  0$ are constants independent of $\\alpha$ and $L$. We minimize this energy with respect to $L$:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dL} = -\\frac{2C_1}{L^3} + \\frac{C_2\\alpha}{L^2} = 0 \\implies L_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{2C_1}{C_2\\alpha}$$\nThe polaron radius $L_{\\text{min}}$ scales as $1/\\alpha$. Substituting this back into the energy expression:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{strong}} = E(L_{\\text{min}}) = \\frac{C_1}{(2C_1/C_2\\alpha)^2} - \\frac{C_2\\alpha}{2C_1/C_2\\alpha} = \\frac{C_1(C_2\\alpha)^2}{4C_1^2} - \\frac{(C_2\\alpha)^2}{2C_1} = -\\frac{(C_2\\alpha)^2}{4C_1}$$\nThe ground state energy thus scales with $\\alpha^2$. The constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ contain other physical parameters such that the final expression has units of energy. A full analysis shows the energy scale is set by $\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{strong}}(\\alpha) = - \\kappa \\alpha^2 \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is a positive dimensionless constant. The sign is negative, indicating that for large $\\alpha$, self-trapping is energetically favorable.\n\nFor part 3, we find the crossover coupling constant $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}}$ by equating the magnitudes of the weak- and strong-coupling energy shifts:\n$$|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{weak}}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}})| = |\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{strong}}(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}})|$$\n$$a \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}} \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}} = \\kappa \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}}^2 \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$$\nFor a non-trivial crossover where $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}} \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}} \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$:\n$$a = \\kappa \\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}}$$\nSolving for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}}$ gives:\n$$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{cross}} = \\frac{a}{\\kappa}$$\n\nFinally, for part 4, we define the intermediate coupling regime. The ratio of the magnitudes of the strong- and weak-coupling energy scales is:\n$$R(\\alpha) = \\frac{|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{strong}}(\\alpha)|}{|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{weak}}(\\alpha)|} = \\frac{\\kappa \\alpha^2 \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}}{a \\alpha \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}} = \\frac{\\kappa}{a} \\alpha$$\nThe intermediate regime is defined by the inequality:\n$$\\frac{1}{q} \\le R(\\alpha) \\le q$$\nUsing the given tolerance factor $q=2$, we have:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\le \\frac{\\kappa}{a} \\alpha \\le 2$$\nWe solve this for $\\alpha$. The lower endpoint of the interval is found from the left inequality:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\le \\frac{\\kappa}{a}\\alpha \\implies \\alpha \\ge \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{a}{\\kappa}$$\nThe upper endpoint of the interval is found from the right inequality:\n$$\\frac{\\kappa}{a}\\alpha \\le 2 \\implies \\alpha \\le 2\\frac{a}{\\kappa}$$\nThe intermediate coupling regime is therefore the interval $\\alpha \\in \\left[\\frac{a}{2\\kappa}, \\frac{2a}{\\kappa}\\right]$. The two endpoints of this interval are $\\frac{a}{2\\kappa}$ and $\\frac{2a}{\\kappa}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{a}{2\\kappa}  \\frac{2a}{\\kappa}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3019279"}]}
