[@problem_id:1818338]", "problem": "In the study of dielectric materials, the local electric field, $E_{local}$, experienced by an individual atom is of central importance. This field is the sum of the externally applied electric field, $E_0$, and the field generated by all other polarized atoms in the material. A common approach to calculate this field is the Lorentz model. In this model, we imagine a small spherical cavity (the \"Lorentz sphere\") centered on the atom of interest. The local field is then expressed as $E_{local} = E_0 + E_1 + E_2$, where $E_1$ is the field from the polarized material outside the sphere, and $E_2$ is the field from the discrete dipoles inside the sphere. The contribution from the material outside is found to be $E_1 = P/(3\\epsilon_0)$, where $P$ is the macroscopic polarization of the dielectric and $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. A common simplification, known as the Lorentz relation, approximates the local field as $E_{local} \\approx E_0 + P/(3\\epsilon_0)$. The accuracy of this relation hinges on the contribution from the dipoles inside the sphere, $E_2$.\n\nConsider two different types of isotropic, non-polar, solid dielectric materials: (1) a perfect single crystal with a cubic lattice structure, and (2) an amorphous solid. For which type of material is the Lorentz relation, which effectively assumes $E_2=0$, a more accurate representation of the local field, and why?\n\nA. It is more accurate for the cubic crystal because the high degree of symmetry in the atomic arrangement ensures that the vector sum of electric fields from all dipoles within the Lorentz sphere is exactly zero at the central atom's location.\n\nB. It is more accurate for the amorphous solid because the random arrangement of atoms causes the fields from the internal dipoles to statistically cancel out, leading to an average value of $E_2$ that is closer to zero than in an ordered crystal.\n\nC. It is more accurate for the amorphous solid because its lack of long-range order makes it behave more like the continuous, uniform medium assumed in the derivation of the $E_1 = P/(3\\epsilon_0)$ term, which is the dominant contribution.\n\nD. It is more accurate for the cubic crystal because the regular, repeating structure allows for a much higher degree of polarization $P$, which makes any deviation due to the $E_2$ term negligible in comparison.\n\nE. The accuracy is identical for both because the Lorentz sphere can be chosen to be large enough to contain a representative sample of atoms in either case, making the internal environment macroscopically equivalent.", "solution": "We begin from the Lorentz construction for the local field at an atomic site,\n$$\nE_{\\text{local}}=E_{0}+E_{1}+E_{2},\n$$\nwith the continuum contribution from outside the spherical cavity given by\n$$\nE_{1}=\\frac{P}{3\\epsilon_{0}}.\n$$\nThe remaining term,\n$$\nE_{2},\n$$\nis the field at the center due to the discrete dipoles inside the Lorentz sphere.

Consequently, the tensor $\\mathbf{S}$ is not constrained to be proportional to the identity for each specific realization, and there is no requirement that it vanish. While an ensemble average over many atoms or configurations may yield $\\langle \\mathbf{S}\\rangle=\\mathbf{0}$, the local field at a specific atom generally experiences nonzero fluctuations from $\\mathbf{E}_{2}$, so the approximation $E_{2}=0$ is less accurate on a per-site basis.\n\nThe outside continuum contribution $E_{1}=P/(3\\epsilon_{0})$ arises from replacing the material outside the cavity by a uniform polarization; this step applies equally to both macroscopically isotropic materials. The decisive difference is the symmetry of the discrete interior, which enforces $\\mathbf{E}_{2}=\\mathbf{0}$ in the cubic crystal but not in the amorphous solid.\n\nTherefore, the Lorentz relation is more accurate for the cubic crystal because its symmetry guarantees that the interior dipole contribution cancels exactly.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1818338"}]}
