Therefore, ratios of surface energies are given by ratios of $n_{s} b$.\n\nFirst compute the surface atomic densities. For the FCC lattice with lattice constant $a$:\n1) $(100)$: Consider the square of side $a$ on the $(100)$ face. It contains four corner atoms, each contributing $\\frac{1}{4}$, and one face-centered atom contributing $1$, for a total of $2$ atoms per area $a^{2}$. Hence\n$$\nn_{s}(100)=\\frac{2}{a^{2}}.\n$$\n2) $(110)$: The primitive cell of the (110) surface has an area of $A_{110}=a^2/\\sqrt{2}$. The 2D Bravais lattice on (110) has one atom per such primitive cell. Therefore\n$$\nn_{s}(110)=\\frac{1}{A_{110}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a^{2}}.\n$$\n3) $(111)$: The $(111)$ surface is a close-packed triangular lattice with nearest-neighbor spacing $d=a/\\sqrt{2}$.
