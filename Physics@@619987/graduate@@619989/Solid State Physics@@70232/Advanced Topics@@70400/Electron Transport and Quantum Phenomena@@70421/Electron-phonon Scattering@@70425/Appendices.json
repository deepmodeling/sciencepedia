This first practice confronts a common conceptual hurdle: the role of phonons and zero-point energy at absolute zero.

The crystal is maintained in its ground state by being held at a temperature of absolute zero ($T=0$ K). The electron can interact with the quantized lattice vibrations of the crystal, known as phonons. After some time, the electron is detected. The question is whether it is possible for the electron's kinetic energy to have increased during its travel through the crystal.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the possibility of the electron absorbing a phonon and thus increasing its kinetic energy in this scenario?\n\nA. Yes, the electron can absorb a phonon corresponding to the zero-point energy of one of the lattice's vibrational modes.\n\nB. Yes, but only if the electron's initial kinetic energy is greater than the average phonon energy in the crystal.\n\nC. No, because the thermal-equilibrium population of phonons available for absorption is precisely zero at absolute zero.\n\nD. No, because any interaction that increases the electron's energy would violate the conservation of energy, as the lattice is already in its ground state.\n\nE. The outcome depends on the crystal structure; in some lattices, absorption is possible at absolute zero, while in others, it is forbidden.", "solution": "We model the system with the standard electron–phonon Hamiltonian\n$$\nH=H_{e}+H_{\\text{ph}}+H_{\\text{int}},\n$$\nwhere $H_{e}$ is the electron Hamiltonian, $H_{\\text{ph}}=\\sum_{q}\\hbar\\omega_{q}\\left(b_{q}^{\\dagger}b_{q}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ is the phonon Hamiltonian, and a typical interaction takes the form\n$$\nH_{\\text{int}}=\\sum_{q}M_{q}\\left(b_{q}\\,\\mathrm{e}^{i q\\cdot r}+b_{q}^{\\dagger}\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-i q\\cdot r}\\right).\n$$\nHere $b_{q}$ and $b_{q}^{\\dagger}$ are phonon annihilation and creation operators, $\\omega_{q}$ is the phonon dispersion, and $M_{q}$ encodes the coupling.\n\nAt temperature $T=0$, the lattice is in its ground state, i.e., the phonon vacuum $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ with occupation numbers $n_{q}=0$ for all modes.

The conservation-law argument does not by itself capture the matrix-element nullification that forbids absorption.\n- E is incorrect: at $T=0$ the vanishing of $n_{q}$ is general and does not depend on crystal structure.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1773717"}, {"introduction": "Having established the quantum nature of phonons, we now explore how the crystalline structure of a solid imposes specific \"rules of the road\" for scattering events.
