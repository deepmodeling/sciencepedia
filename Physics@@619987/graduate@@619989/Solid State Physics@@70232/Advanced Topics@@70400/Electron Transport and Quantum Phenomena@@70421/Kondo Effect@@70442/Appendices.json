This interaction is antiferromagnetic in nature, leading to the characteristic Kondo screening effect at low temperatures.\n\nWe are interested in the thermodynamic properties of the impurity itself. The \"impurity entropy,\" $S_{imp}$, is the contribution to the total entropy of the system arising from the impurity's degrees of freedom.\n\nTwo distinct physical regimes are known:\n1.  **High-Temperature Limit ($T \\gg T_K$):** At temperatures much higher than the characteristic Kondo temperature, $T_K$, the thermal energy dominates the interaction. The impurity is effectively decoupled from the conduction electrons and behaves as a free entity. Its $N$ internal states are considered energetically degenerate.\n2.  **Low-Temperature Limit ($T \\to 0$):** As the system is cooled well below the Kondo temperature, the strong coupling between the impurity and the conduction electrons becomes dominant. They form a collective, many-body ground state. It is a fundamental result of the model that this ground state is a non-degenerate singlet, meaning it is a unique quantum state.\n\nUsing these facts, determine the total change in the impurity entropy, $\\Delta S_{imp} = S_{imp}(T=0) - S_{imp}(T \\to \\infty)$, as the system is cooled from the high-temperature limit to absolute zero.
