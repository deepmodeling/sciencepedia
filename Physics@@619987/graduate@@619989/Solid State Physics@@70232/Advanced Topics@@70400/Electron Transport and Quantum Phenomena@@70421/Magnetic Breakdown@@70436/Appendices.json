This phenomenon is particularly relevant in metals where different sheets of the Fermi surface approach each other closely.\n\nConsider a hypothetical two-dimensional metal with a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ applied perpendicular to the plane. The Fermi surface of this metal has regions where two distinct energy bands, which we can approximate as band 1 and band 2, come close to each other. In the absence of any interaction between the bands, their corresponding sheets of the Fermi surface would cross at a point $\\mathbf{k}_c$ in the Brillouin zone.\n\nAt this crossing point $\\mathbf{k}_c$, the semiclassical group velocities of the electrons on the unperturbed bands are $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2$. For this particular metal, it is known that these velocities are orthogonal, i.e., $\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2 = 0$. The interaction between the bands creates an energy gap of magnitude $\\Delta E_g$ at $\\mathbf{k}_c$, preventing the bands from crossing.\n\nThe probability $P$ for an electron to tunnel across this gap (i.e., to switch bands) is given by the Landau-Zener-like formula $P = \\exp(-B_0/B)$, where $B = |\\mathbf{B}|$ is the magnitude of the applied magnetic field and $B_0$ is the characteristic **breakdown field**. For the described system with orthogonal velocities, a detailed theoretical analysis shows that the breakdown field is related to the energy gap by the formula:\n$$\nB_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2 e \\hbar} \\frac{(\\Delta E_g)^2}{v_1 v_2}\n$$\nwhere $v_1 = |\\mathbf{v}_1|$, $v_2 = |\\mathbf{v}_2|$, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nAn experiment on this metal measures the breakdown field to be $B_0$. Given the values of $v_1$ and $v_2$ from band structure calculations, derive an expression for the inter-band energy gap $\\Delta E_g$ in terms of $B_0$, $v_1$, $v_2$, and the fundamental constants $e$ and $\\hbar$.", "solution": "The given formula for the breakdown field is:\n$$\nB_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2 e \\hbar} \\frac{(\\Delta E_g)^2}{v_1 v_2}\n$$\nwhere $B_0$ is the breakdown field, $\\Delta E_g$ is the energy gap, $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the magnitudes of the group velocities, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nTo solve for $\\Delta E_g$, isolate $(\\Delta E_g)^2$:\n1.

Let's label these orbits 1 and 2. If these orbits were isolated, electrons would traverse them with characteristic cyclotron frequencies $\\omega_{c1}$ and $\\omega_{c2}$, respectively.\n\nIn a sufficiently strong magnetic field, a phenomenon called magnetic breakdown can occur if these two orbits pass very close to each other in k-space. This allows an electron to tunnel from one orbit to the other at the point of closest approach (the junction). This coupling creates new, larger, composite orbits.\n\nAssume that at the junction, the breakdown is \"perfect,\" meaning an electron arriving at the junction on one orbit will always tunnel to the other orbit. This process forms a new composite orbit shaped like a \"figure-eight\". An electron starting on orbit 1 will traverse the entire loop, tunnel to orbit 2 at the junction, traverse the entire second loop, and return to the junction, thereby completing one full cycle of the figure-eight trajectory.\n\nCalculate the total time period, $T_{total}$, for an electron to complete one full cycle of this figure-eight composite orbit.
