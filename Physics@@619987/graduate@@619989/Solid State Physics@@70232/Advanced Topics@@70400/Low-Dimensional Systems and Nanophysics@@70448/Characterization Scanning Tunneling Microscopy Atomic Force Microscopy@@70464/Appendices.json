{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A scanning probe microscope does not produce a perfect representation of a surface; instead, the resulting image is a convolution of the sample's topography and the shape of the probe tip. This practice explores this fundamental limitation, known as tip convolution, which can significantly distort measured features. By analyzing the simple case of imaging a narrow trench, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how a finite tip radius broadens features and reduces their apparent depth, a critical skill for accurately interpreting any AFM or STM image.", "problem": "An Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) probe in contact mode can be idealized near its apex by a sphere of radius $R$ mounted on a rigid conical shank. Consider imaging a sample that contains a rectangular trench: the top surface is planar, the trench has vertical sidewalls separated by a width $w$ (measured at the top plane) and a flat bottom at depth $d$ below the top surface. The measured AFM topography at lateral position $x$ is the height of the lowest tip apex position $z(x)$ such that the spherical tip just makes contact with the sample without interpenetration. Assume purely repulsive, non-adhesive contact and that the conical shank does not interfere before the spherical apex does. Separately, in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at small bias, the tunneling current $I$ under the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation obeys $I \\propto \\exp(-2 \\kappa z)$ with $\\kappa = \\sqrt{2 m \\phi}/\\hbar$, where $m$ is the electron mass, $\\phi$ is the effective barrier height, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant; in constant-current mode the feedback adjusts $z(x)$ to maintain a setpoint current as the tip scans.\n\nUsing only the above first-principles geometrical non-penetration for AFM and the exponential distance dependence for STM, analyze how a finite tip radius broadens apparent feature sizes and alters the measured depth of narrow trenches. In your analysis, treat the AFM apex as a sphere of radius $R$ and the STM tip as locally sharp but with a finite decay length $1/(2 \\kappa)$ for tunneling. For a concrete numerical case, consider $R = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $w = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $d = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nSelect all options that are correct.\n\nA. In contact-mode AFM over the rectangular trench, the maximum apparent depth at the trench center (relative to the top surface) is $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max}(w,R,d) = \\min\\!\\left(d,\\, R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}\\right)$, obtained by the condition that the spherical apex simultaneously touches both trench edges when it can no longer descend without sidewall contact.\n\nB. In the AFM limit $w \\ll R$ and for trenches deeper than the tip-limited descent, the apparent depth at the center scales as $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max} \\approx w^{2}/(8 R)$, independent of $d$.\n\nC. A necessary and sufficient condition for the AFM spherical apex to reach and trace the trench bottom is $w \\ge 2 \\sqrt{2 R d - d^{2}}$ (for $d \\le 2 R$); equivalently, if this is not satisfied the apex never reaches the bottom and the measured depth is tip-limited.\n\nD. In STM constant-current imaging, if the apex is atomically sharp so that $R \\to 0$, the apparent trench depth equals the true depth $d$ because tunneling current arises only from the nearest point directly beneath the apex and has no lateral spread.\n\nE. In STM constant-current imaging, even with a very sharp apex, the finite decay length $1/(2 \\kappa)$ causes lateral collection of tunneling current from the trench sidewalls; the feedback therefore reduces the apparent trench depth below $d$ for sufficiently narrow trenches, constituting an effective tip convolution distinct from purely geometrical dilation.\n\nF. In AFM tapping mode, intermittent contact eliminates tip convolution, so the apparent trench width and depth are equal to $w$ and $d$ regardless of $R$.\n\nG. For $R = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $w = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $d = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, the AFM maximum apparent depth at the center is approximately $0.84\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and the apex does not reach the trench bottom.", "solution": "The AFM imaging process in contact mode can be formalized as a non-penetration problem: the measured height profile is the lower envelope of tip apex positions that do not intersect the sample. Modeling the apex as a sphere of radius $R$, the envelope construction is the same as a morphological dilation of the sample by the tip shape. For a rectangular trench with vertical walls and a flat bottom, the limiting descent of the spherical apex at the trench center occurs when the sphere simultaneously touches both upper edges; beyond that point, any further descent would interpenetrate the sidewalls.\n\nTo derive the tip-limited maximum descent at the trench center, place the top surface at $z = 0$ and the trench center at $x = 0$. The vertical walls lie at $x = \\pm w/2$, extending down from $z = 0$. Let the sphere center be at $(x,z) = (0, z_{c})$ and its apex (lowest point) at $z_{\\mathrm{apex}} = z_{c} - R$. The sphere just touching the two top edges at $(x,z) = (\\pm w/2, 0)$ implies that these edge points lie on the spherical surface. Therefore the condition for simultaneous contact is\n$$(w/2)^{2} + (0 - z_{c})^{2} = R^{2},$$\nso that\n$z_{c} = \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}.$\nThe corresponding apex height relative to the top surface is\n$$z_{\\mathrm{apex}} = z_{c} - R = -\\left(R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}\\right).$$\nThus, the maximum descent of the apex below the top plane without interpenetration is\n$$\\Delta z_{\\max}(w,R) = R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}},$$\nprovided $w \\le 2 R$ so that the square root is real. The apparent depth at the trench center is the smaller of this tip-limited descent and the true depth $d$,\n$$d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max}(w,R,d) = \\min\\!\\left(d,\\, R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}\\right).$$\nIf $w > 2 R$, the sidewalls no longer constrain the sphere and the apex can in principle reach the bottom; in that case the measured depth is $d$ (modulo shank interference, which we neglect by assumption).\n\nFor $w \\ll R$, expand the square root using $\\sqrt{1 - x} \\approx 1 - x/2$ for small $x$ with $x = (w/2R)^{2}$. One obtains\n$$R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}} = R \\left[1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{w}{2R}\\right)^{2}}\\right] \\approx R \\left[1 - \\left(1 - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\tfrac{w}{2R}\\right)^{2}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{w^{2}}{8 R}.$$\nConsequently, when $d \\gg w^{2}/(8 R)$ the apparent depth is $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max} \\approx w^{2}/(8 R)$, independent of $d$.\n\nThe condition for the apex to reach the trench bottom is that, when the apex is at the bottom ($z_{\\mathrm{apex}} = -d$, i.e., $z_{c} = R - d$), the sphere does not intersect the sidewalls at the top edges. Non-intersection at $(\\pm w/2, 0)$ requires these edge points to be outside or on the sphere:\n$$(w/2)^{2} + (0 - z_{c})^{2} \\ge R^{2}.$$\nSubstituting $z_{c} = R - d$ yields\n$$(w/2)^{2} + (R - d)^{2} \\ge R^{2} \\;\\;\\Rightarrow\\;\\; (w/2)^{2} \\ge 2 R d - d^{2}.$$\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition for the apex to reach the bottom is\n$$w \\ge 2 \\sqrt{2 R d - d^{2}}, \\quad \\text{for } d \\le 2 R.$$\nIf this inequality is violated, the apex cannot reach the bottom; the measured depth is tip-limited by the geometric constraint derived above.\n\nTurning to Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), the constant-current topography $z(x)$ is defined implicitly by the condition that the integrated tunneling current between the tip and the sample equals the setpoint. In the simplest local approximation, the tunneling current from any local point separated by a gap $z$ obeys $I \\propto \\exp(-2 \\kappa z)$ with $\\kappa = \\sqrt{2 m \\phi}/\\hbar$. Crucially, this dependence is not strictly local in lateral extent: nearby regions at similar $z$ contribute comparably if they are within a lateral distance where the vacuum gap to the tip is not much larger. Over a trench with vertical sidewalls, even an atomically sharp apex ($R \\to 0$) at the trench center receives significant current from the sidewalls because their shortest separation to the apex is only slightly larger than the vertical gap; as the tip descends, the sidewall contributions increase rapidly due to the exponential law, causing the feedback to retract the tip to maintain the setpoint. Hence, the apparent trench depth is reduced below the true $d$ for sufficiently narrow $w$. This broadening mechanism is intrinsically electronic (set by $\\kappa$) and persists even for $R \\to 0$, distinguishing it from purely geometrical dilation.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. This is exactly the geometrical non-penetration result derived above. The maximum apparent depth at the center is limited by simultaneous contact with both edges, giving $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max}(w,R,d) = \\min\\!\\left(d,\\, R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}}\\right)$ for $w \\le 2 R$, and reduces to $d$ when $w > 2 R$. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Using the small-argument expansion for $w \\ll R$, we found $d_{\\mathrm{AFM}}^{\\max} \\approx w^{2}/(8 R)$ provided the true depth $d$ exceeds this tip-limited value. This is independent of $d$ in that regime. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. We derived the reach-bottom criterion $w \\ge 2 \\sqrt{2 R d - d^{2}}$ (for $d \\le 2 R$). Failure of this inequality implies the apex cannot reach the bottom and the measured depth is limited by the tip geometry. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. The statement assumes perfect locality of tunneling, which contradicts the exponential distance dependence that gives finite lateral collection of current. Even for $R \\to 0$, nearby sidewalls contribute because their separation is only slightly larger than the vertical gap, so the apparent depth is not guaranteed to equal $d$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This option correctly identifies that the finite decay length $1/(2 \\kappa)$ causes lateral averaging of the tunneling current and reduces the apparent depth in narrow trenches even for an atomically sharp tip. This is an electronic convolution distinct from pure geometric dilation. Verdict: Correct.\n\nF. Tapping (amplitude-modulation) AFM reduces shear and adhesion but does not remove the geometric constraint set by the finite apex radius; intermittent contact cannot make the apex narrower. Tip convolution remains, so apparent widths and depths depend on $R$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nG. Using $R = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $w = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, and $d = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, compute\n$$R - \\sqrt{R^{2} - (w/2)^{2}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm} - \\sqrt{(10\\,\\mathrm{nm})^{2} - (4\\,\\mathrm{nm})^{2}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm} - \\sqrt{100 - 16}\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nm} - \\sqrt{84}\\,\\mathrm{nm}.$$\nSince $\\sqrt{84} \\approx 9.165$, the tip-limited descent is $\\approx 0.835\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Because $d = 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ exceeds this value, the apparent depth is $\\approx 0.84\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Check the bottom-reach criterion:\n$$2 \\sqrt{2 R d - d^{2}} = 2 \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 5 - 25}\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 2 \\sqrt{100 - 25}\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 2 \\sqrt{75}\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 17.32\\,\\mathrm{nm}.$$\nThe given $w = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ is less than this threshold, so the apex cannot reach the bottom.
