You will explore how the unique bipartite nature of the honeycomb lattice causes this simple defect to create a special, localized state at the Fermi energy, revealing the deep interplay between lattice symmetry and quantum mechanics.", "problem": "A single vacancy in a graphene monolayer is a fundamental point defect that significantly alters the local electronic properties. Within the nearest-neighbor tight-binding model, a vacancy is known to introduce a quasi-localized state at the Fermi energy ($E=0$). A key characteristic of this state is its spatial distribution across the two sublattices (A and B) of the honeycomb lattice.\n\nTo quantify this, we define the sublattice polarization of a quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_i \\psi_i |i\\rangle$ as:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in A} |\\psi_i|^2 - \\sum_{j \\in B} |\\psi_j|^2}{\\sum_{k} |\\psi_k|^2} $$\nwhere the sums run over all sites of the specified sublattice.\n\nConsider a graphene monolayer described by the standard nearest-neighbor tight-binding Hamiltonian, $H_0 = -t \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} (|i\\rangle\\langle j| + |j\\rangle\\langle i|)$.

Introducing a vacancy on sublattice A removes one site from the lattice, altering the connectivity. For the zero-energy state ($ E = 0 $), the Schrödinger equation $ H|\\psi\\rangle = 0 $ implies:\n$$\n\\sum_{j \\in \\text{neighbors of } i} \\psi_j = 0 \\quad \\text{for all remaining sites } i.\n$$\nThis condition must hold for every site $ i $ not removed by the vacancy.\n\n### Step 2: Sublattice structure and vacancy effects\nGraphene's honeycomb lattice is bipartite, with sublattices A and B. Each A site connects only to B sites and vice versa. Removing an A-site vacancy breaks the symmetry, leaving its three neighboring B sites with reduced coordination (each loses one connection to the removed A site).\n\nFor the zero-energy state:\n- **At B sites adjacent to the vacancy**: Each has two remaining A neighbors. The tight-binding condition becomes $ \\psi_{A_1} + \\psi_{A_2} = 0 $, where $ A_1, A_2 $ are the surviving neighbors.\n- **At all other B sites**: Each retains three A neighbors, so $ \\psi_{A_1} + \\psi_{A_2} + \\psi_{A_3} = 0 $.\n- **At all A sites (excluding the vacancy)**: Each has three B neighbors, so $ \\psi_{B_1} + \\psi_{B_2} + \\psi_{B_3} = 0 $.\n\n### Step 3: Wavefunction localization on sublattice B\nA key property of the zero-energy state induced by a single vacancy is its confinement to the **opposite sublattice**. Specifically:\n- If the vacancy is on sublattice A, the zero-energy state has non-zero amplitude **only on sublattice B**.\n- This arises from the bipartite nature of the lattice and the rank deficiency introduced by the vacancy. The Hamiltonian matrix becomes block-off-diagonal, and the zero-energy solution resides entirely in the kernel of the reduced hopping matrix between sublattices.\n\nThus, $ \\psi_i = 0 $ for all $ i \\in A $, and $ \\psi_j \\neq 0 $ only for $ j \\in B $.\n\n### Step 4: Compute sublattice polarization\nThe sublattice polarization is defined as:\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in A} |\\psi_i|^2 - \\sum_{j \\in B} |\\psi_j|^2}{\\sum_{k} |\\psi_k|^2}.\n$$\nSince $ \\sum_{i \\in A} |\\psi_i|^2 = 0 $ and $ \\sum_{j \\in B} |\\psi_j|^2 = \\sum_{k} |\\psi_k|^2 $ (the total norm), we substitute:\n$$\nP = \\frac{0 - \\sum_{j \\in B} |\\psi_j|^2}{\\sum_{k} |\\psi_k|^2} = \\frac{-\\sum_{k} |\\psi_k|^2}{\\sum_{k} |\\psi_k|^2} = -1.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "116518"}]}
