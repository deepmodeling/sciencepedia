The characteristic length of this helix is the pitch, $p$. When a strong external field (electric or magnetic) is applied perpendicular to the helical axis, the twisting can be completely suppressed, leading to a uniformly aligned nematic state. This is known as the field-unwound state.\n\nWhen the external field is removed, the system relaxes back to its stable cholesteric configuration.
