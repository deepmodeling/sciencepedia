Let $s(t)$ be the contour length of the chain that has retracted from the tube's end into the tube at time $t$.

This snake-like motion is diffusive and is characterized by a curvilinear diffusion constant, $D_c$. The terminal relaxation time, known as the reptation time $\\tau_d$, is the time it takes for the chain to fully escape its original tube.\n\n**Problem Setup:** We modify this picture by considering a polymer chain decorated with $n_s$ special monomer units, or \"stickers,\" distributed along its backbone. Each sticker can form a reversible, physical bond (a temporary crosslink) with the surrounding polymer matrix. At any given moment in thermal equilibrium, any single sticker is in a \"bound\" state with probability $p$ and in an \"unbound\" state with probability $1-p$. The states of the different stickers are statistically independent.\n\n**Dynamical Model:** The reptation dynamics of the chain are coupled to the state of the stickers. We adopt a simplified model where the chain's curvilinear motion is completely arrested if *at least one* of its stickers is bound. The chain is only mobile and diffuses along its tube with its intrinsic diffusion constant $D_c$ when *all* $n_s$ stickers are simultaneously in the unbound state.
