For example, Silicon Carbide (SiC) exhibits many polytypes. A common way to describe these structures is to consider stacking faults, which are disruptions in the ideal periodic stacking sequence.\n\nConsider a simplified one-dimensional model of a crystal consisting of a very large number of stacked layers. The occurrence of a stacking fault at any given layer is a random event. We assume that the probability of a fault occurring at any layer is a constant, $\\alpha$, and that the events of fault formation at different layers are mutually independent.\n\nYour task is to calculate the average number of perfectly stacked layers, denoted by $\\langle n \\rangle$, that one would find enclosed between two consecutive stacking faults.

A run of perfectly stacked layers between two consecutive faults starts immediately after a fault and ends at the next fault. The length of such a run, $n$, is the number of consecutive non-fault layers between two faults.\n\nThe probability that a run has exactly $n$ perfectly stacked layers is the probability of $n$ consecutive non-fault layers followed by a fault at the next layer.

The arrangement of layers can be described by specifying the lateral position of each layer, denoted as A, B, or C.\n\nA simplified model for describing these structures uses stacking vectors. A \"cyclic\" or \"positive\" stacking step shifts layers in the sequence A→B, B→C, or C→A, and can be represented by a single vector $\\mathbf{s}_{+}$. An \"anticyclic\" or \"negative\" step corresponds to the sequence A→C, C→B, or B→A, represented by the vector $\\mathbf{s}_{-}$, where $\\mathbf{s}_{-} = -\\mathbf{s}_{+}$. The sequence of these stacking vectors completely defines a polytype. For instance, the common 3C (cubic) polytype corresponds to a purely cyclic sequence (e.g., ...ABCABC...) with all stacking vectors being $\\mathbf{s}_{+}$, while the 2H (hexagonal) polytype corresponds to an alternating sequence (e.g., ...ABABAB...) with stacking vectors alternating between $\\mathbf{s}_{+}$ and $\\mathbf{s}_{-}$.\n\nThe local character of the stacking around a given layer can be described by the Jagodzinski notation. A layer is said to have 'h' (hexagonal) character if its two adjacent layers are in the same relative position, for instance, in a B-A-B sequence, the central A layer is 'h-like'. A layer has 'c' (cubic) character if its neighbors are in different positions, as in C-A-B, where A is 'c-like'. In terms of stacking vectors, a layer $i$ has 'h' character if the vector from layer $i-1$ to $i$ ($\\mathbf{s}_{i-1}$) is the negative of the vector from layer $i$ to $i+1$ ($\\mathbf{s}_{i}$), i.e., $\\mathbf{s}_{i-1} = -\\mathbf{s}_{i}$.\n\nConsider a crystal exhibiting random stacking faults.

A cyclic transition (e.g., A→B, B→C, C→A) is a positive turn (+), while an anti-cyclic transition (e.g., A→C, C→B, B→A) is a negative turn (-).\n\nA periodic stacking sequence can be described by a Zhdanov symbol $(n_1 m_1 n_2 m_2 \\dots)$, which represents a sequence of $n_1$ positive turns, followed by $m_1$ negative turns, and so on. The total number of layers in the repeating unit cell is $N = \\sum_i (n_i + m_i)$.\n\nThe overall symmetry of a polytype can be either hexagonal (H) or rhombohedral (R).
