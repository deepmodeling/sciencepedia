The local average orientation of the molecules is described by a unit vector field $\\mathbf{n}$, called the director. In a cholesteric phase, the director exhibits a natural twist. The elastic energy associated with deformations of the director is described by the Frank-Oseen free energy density.\n\nFor a cholesteric liquid crystal confined between two parallel plates, where the director $\\mathbf{n}$ is everywhere parallel to the plates, the director configuration can be described by an angle $\\phi(z)$ such that $\\mathbf{n}(z) = (\\cos\\phi(z), \\sin\\phi(z), 0)$. Here, the $z$-axis is perpendicular to the plates. For such a pure twist deformation, the Frank-Oseen free energy density simplifies to:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2} K_2 \\left(q_0 - \\frac{d\\phi}{dz}\\right)^2$$\nwhere $K_2$ is the twist elastic constant and $q_0$ is the intrinsic wavenumber, related to the natural pitch $P_0$ of the helix by $q_0 = 2\\pi/P_0$.\n\nConsider a planar cholesteric liquid crystal cell of thickness $d$. The director is strongly anchored to the surfaces at $z=0$ and $z=d$. The anchoring at the bottom plate ($z=0$) fixes the director along the $x$-axis, so $\\phi(0) = 0$. The anchoring at the top plate ($z=d$) fixes the director at a constant angle $\\alpha$ with respect to the $x$-axis, so $\\phi(d) = \\alpha$.
