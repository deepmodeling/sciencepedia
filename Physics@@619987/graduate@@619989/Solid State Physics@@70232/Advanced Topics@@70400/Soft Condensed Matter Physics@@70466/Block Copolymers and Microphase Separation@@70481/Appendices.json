A set of experimental scattering vector magnitudes, $q$: $\\{0.12500, 0.14434, 0.19094, 0.20412, 0.22822, 0.23936\\}$, all in units of $\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\n2.

It presents realistic experimental data and asks for a conclusion based on rigorous application of established physical and mathematical models. The statement about a \"chemically symmetric\" copolymer might naively suggest a lamellar phase, as volume fractions $f \\approx 0.5$ typically lead to lamellae. However, the gyroid phase is known to form in a narrow composition window, and the primary task is to identify the structure from the scattering data itself, which must be treated as the definitive evidence. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution may be pursued.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of theoretical peak position ratios.\nThe position of a Bragg peak in reciprocal space, $q_{hkl}$, is related to the interplanar spacing of the corresponding crystallographic planes, $d_{hkl}$, by the equation $q_{hkl} = 2\\pi/d_{hkl}$. We must determine the allowed values of $d_{hkl}$ for each morphology.\n\nCase A: One-dimensional Lamellae\nLamellae represent a periodic stacking in one dimension with a period $D$. The reflecting planes are separated by distances $d_n = D/n$ where $n$ is an integer $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe corresponding scattering vectors are:\n$$ q_n = \\frac{2\\pi}{d_n} = \\frac{2\\pi n}{D} $$\nLet the position of the first peak ($n=1$) be $q_1 = q^* = 2\\pi/D$. Then the positions of higher-order peaks are $q_n = n q^*$.\nThe ratios of the peak positions normalized by the first peak are:\n$$ \\frac{q_n}{q_1} = n \\implies 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \\ldots $$\n\nCase B: Hexagonally Packed Cylinders\nThis morphology corresponds to a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice in the plane perpendicular to the cylinder axes. For a 2D hexagonal lattice with lattice parameter $a$, the interplanar spacing $d_{hk}$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{1}{d_{hk}^2} = \\frac{4}{3a^2} (h^2 + hk + k^2) $$\nThe scattering vector magnitude is $q_{hk} = 2\\pi/d_{hk}$. Squaring and substituting gives:\n$$ q_{hk}^2 = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2} (h^2 + hk + k^2) $$\nLet $q_1$ be the position of the first-order peak, which corresponds to the smallest non-zero value of $h^2+hk+k^2$. This occurs for the $\\{10\\}$ family of planes, where $h^2+hk+k^2 = 1$. Thus, $q_1 = q_{10} = \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}$.\nThe positions of all allowed peaks are given by $q_{hk} = q_1 \\sqrt{h^2+hk+k^2}$.\nThe allowed values for $N = h^2+hk+k^2$ for integer pairs $(h,k)$ are $1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, \\ldots$.\nThe expected ratios of peak positions are therefore:\n$$ \\frac{q_{hk}}{q_1} = \\sqrt{N} \\implies \\sqrt{1}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{4}, \\sqrt{7}, \\sqrt{9}, \\sqrt{12}, \\ldots \\approx 1, 1.732, 2.000, 2.646, 3.000, 3.464, \\ldots $$\n\nCase C: Bicontinuous Cubic Gyroid ($\\mathrm{Ia\\bar{3}d}$)\nFor a cubic lattice with lattice parameter $a$, the interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$ is:\n$$ d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2}} $$\nThe corresponding scattering vector magnitude is:\n$$ q_{hkl} = \\frac{2\\pi}{d_{hkl}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2} $$\nThe space group $\\mathrm{Ia\\bar{3}d}$ imposes systematic extinction conditions on the Miller indices $(h,k,l)$. The first allowed reflection is not the lowest-index one. A full analysis of the space group selection rules reveals the following sequence for the sum of squares, $N = h^2+k^2+l^2$, for the first few allowed reflections: $N=6$ for $\\{211\\}$ and $N=8$ for $\\{220\\}$. These are followed by reflections corresponding to $N=14, 16, 22, 24, \\ldots$.\nLet the first peak be $q_1$, which corresponds to $N_1=6$ (the $\\{211\\}$ reflection).\n$$ q_1 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\sqrt{6} $$\nThe ratio of any other allowed peak $q_{hkl}$ to the first peak $q_1$ is:\n$$ \\frac{q_{hkl}}{q_1} = \\frac{(2\\pi/a)\\sqrt{N}}{(2\\pi/a)\\sqrt{6}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{N}{6}} $$\nThe expected sequence of peak ratios for the commonly observed gyroid reflections is:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{6}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{6}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{14}{6}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{6}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{22}{6}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{6}}, \\ldots $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ 1, \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{3}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{3}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3}}, \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{3}}, \\sqrt{4}, \\ldots \\approx 1, 1.155, 1.528, 1.633, 1.915, 2.000, \\ldots $$\n\nPart 2: Morphology Identification and Peak Indexing\nWe normalize the experimental $q$ values by the first peak position, $q_1 = 0.12500\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\n\nExperimental $q_i$ ($\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$) | Ratio $q_i/q_1$\n--- | ---\n$0.12500$ | $1.0000$\n$0.14434$ | $1.1547$\n$0.19094$ | $1.5275$\n$0.20412$ | $1.6330$\n$0.22822$ | $1.8258$\n$0.23936$ | $1.9149$\n\nComparing these experimental ratios with the theoretical predictions:\n- Lamellae ($1, 2, 3, \\ldots$): No match.\n- Hexagonal ($1, 1.732, 2, \\ldots$): No match.\n- Gyroid ($1, 1.155, 1.528, 1.633, 1.915, \\ldots$): There is a strong correspondence, but the sequence appears perturbed.\n\nLet us examine the gyroid case more closely. The first four experimental ratios match the first four theoretical ratios for gyroid with high precision.\n- $q_2/q_1 = 1.1547 \\approx \\sqrt{4/3}$\n- $q_3/q_1 = 1.5275 \\approx \\sqrt{7/3}$\n- $q_4/q_1 = 1.6330 \\approx \\sqrt{8/3}$\nThe sixth experimental peak, $q_6/q_1 = 1.9149$, matches the fifth theoretical peak, $\\sqrt{11/3}$.\nThe fifth experimental peak, $q_5/q_1 = 1.8258$, is unaccounted for in the common sequence. Let us determine the corresponding value of $N$.\n$ (q_5/q_1)^2 = N_5/N_1 \\implies (1.8258)^2 = N_5/6 \\implies N_5 \\approx 6 \\times (1.8258)^2 \\approx 20.00$.\nSo, we must check if a reflection for $N=h^2+k^2+l^2=20$ is allowed in space group $\\mathrm{Ia\\bar{3}d}$. The Miller indices for $N=20$ are from the family $\\{420\\}$.\nThe selection rules for $\\mathrm{Ia\\bar{3}d}$ are:\n1.  General $(hkl)$: $h+k+l = 2n$ (even). For $(420)$, $4+2+0=6$, which is even.\n2.  Special $(0kl)$: $k=2n, l=2n$. For the permutation $(024)$, $k=2, l=4$, both are even.\nThus, the $\\{420\\}$ reflection is indeed allowed by the space group symmetry. While often having low intensity and being omitted from simplified lists, its presence in the data is perfectly valid.\n\nThe experimental data is therefore consistent with the Gyroid morphology. The correct indexing is as follows:\n\nPeak | Exp. Ratio $q_i/q_1$ | Theory Ratio $\\sqrt{N/6}$ | $N=h^2+k^2+l^2$ | Miller Indices $\\{hkl\\}$\n--- | --- | --- | --- | ---\n1 | $1.0000$ | $\\sqrt{6/6}=1.0000$ | $6$ | $\\{211\\}$\n2 | $1.1547$ | $\\sqrt{8/6} \\approx 1.1547$ | $8$ | $\\{220\\}$\n3 | $1.5275$ | $\\sqrt{14/6} \\approx 1.5275$ | $14$ | $\\{321\\}$\n4 | $1.6330$ | $\\sqrt{16/6} \\approx 1.6330$ | $16$ | $\\{400\\}$\n5 | $1.8258$ | $\\sqrt{20/6} \\approx 1.8257$ | $20$ | $\\{420\\}$\n6 | $1.9149$ | $\\sqrt{22/6} \\approx 1.9149$ | $22$ | $\\{332\\}$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the fundamental real-space length scale.\nThe identified morphology is the cubic gyroid, for which the fundamental length scale is the cubic lattice parameter, $a$. The relationship is:\n$$ a = \\frac{2\\pi}{q_{hkl}} \\sqrt{h^2+k^2+l^2} $$\nTo obtain a precise value for $a$, we can use the data from the first and most accurately reported peak, $q_1 = q_{211} = 0.12500\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.
