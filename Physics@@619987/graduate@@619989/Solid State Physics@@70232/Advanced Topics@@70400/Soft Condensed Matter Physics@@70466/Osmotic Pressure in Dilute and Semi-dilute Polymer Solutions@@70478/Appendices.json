The terminology is precise and objective. The problem is self-contained and free from internal contradictions or factual errors. The underlying models, while being approximations, are cornerstones of polymer science. Therefore, the problem statement is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe foundation of our analysis is the Flory-Huggins expression for the Gibbs free energy of mixing per lattice site, $\\Delta g_{\\text{mix}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta g_{\\text{mix}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = (1-\\phi) \\ln(1-\\phi) + \\frac{\\phi}{N} \\ln(\\phi) + \\chi \\phi(1-\\phi)\n$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the volume fraction of the polymer, $N$ is the degree of polymerization, and $\\chi$ is the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter.\n\nThe chemical potential difference of the solvent between the solution and the pure state, $\\Delta \\mu_{1} = \\mu_{1} - \\mu_{1}^{0}$, is related to the free energy of mixing by:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mu_{1} = \\Delta g_{\\text{mix}} - \\phi \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta g_{\\text{mix}})}{\\partial \\phi}\n$$\nCalculating the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta g_{\\text{mix}})}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\ln(1-\\phi) - 1 + \\frac{1}{N}\\ln(\\phi) + \\frac{1}{N} + \\chi(1-2\\phi)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta \\mu_1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\mu_1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\left[ (1-\\phi)\\ln(1-\\phi) + \\frac{\\phi}{N}\\ln\\phi + \\chi\\phi(1-\\phi) \\right] - \\phi \\left[ -\\ln(1-\\phi) - 1 + \\frac{1}{N}\\ln\\phi + \\frac{1}{N} + \\chi - 2\\chi\\phi \\right]\n$$\nAfter algebraic simplification, this yields the standard result:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta \\mu_1}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\ln(1-\\phi) + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{N}\\right)\\phi + \\chi\\phi^2\n$$\nThe osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ is defined by the condition of thermodynamic equilibrium across the semipermeable membrane, which requires that the chemical potential of the solvent is equalized. This leads to the relation $\\Pi v_0 = -\\Delta \\mu_1$, where $v_0$ is the molecular volume of the solvent.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Pi v_0}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = - \\left[ \\ln(1-\\phi) + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{N}\\right)\\phi + \\chi\\phi^2 \\right]\n$$\nTo analyze the behavior for small polymer volume fraction $\\phi \\ll 1$, we perform a Taylor expansion of the logarithmic term: $\\ln(1-\\phi) = -\\phi - \\frac{\\phi^2}{2} - \\frac{\\phi^3}{3} - \\mathcal{O}(\\phi^4)$.\nSubstituting this expansion:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Pi v_0}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = - \\left[ \\left(-\\phi - \\frac{\\phi^2}{2} - \\frac{\\phi^3}{3} - \\dots \\right) + \\phi - \\frac{\\phi}{N} + \\chi\\phi^2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Pi v_0}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = - \\left[ -\\frac{\\phi}{N} + \\left(\\chi - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\phi^2 - \\frac{\\phi^3}{3} - \\dots \\right]\n$$\nThis results in the virial expansion for the osmotic pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Pi v_0}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\frac{\\phi}{N} + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\chi\\right)\\phi^2 + \\frac{\\phi^3}{3} + \\mathcal{O}(\\phi^4)\n$$\nThe problem specifies theta conditions, which are defined by $\\chi=1/2$. At this special point, the coefficient of the $\\phi^2$ term, which corresponds to the second virial coefficient, vanishes.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Pi v_0}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\frac{\\phi}{N} + \\frac{1}{3}\\phi^3 + \\mathcal{O}(\\phi^4) \\quad (\\text{for } \\chi=1/2)\n$$\nThis expression describes the behavior for small $\\phi$.\n\nNow, we analyze the distinct regimes:\n\n1.  **Dilute Regime ($\\phi \\ll \\phi^{\\ast}$)**:\n    In this regime, polymer chains are sufficiently far apart that their interactions are negligible. The osmotic pressure is governed by the ideal gas law of the polymer chains. This corresponds to the leading term in the virial expansion. For any finite $N$, the term $\\phi/N$ dominates for sufficiently small $\\phi$.\n    $$\n    \\Pi \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{v_0}\\frac{\\phi}{N}\n    $$\n    Thus, the osmotic pressure scales as $\\Pi \\propto \\phi/N$.\n\n2.  **Semidilute Regime ($\\phi^{\\ast} \\ll \\phi \\ll 1$)**:\n    In this regime, the polymer chains overlap and form a transient network. The virial expansion is not valid here. We must use the scaling picture based on correlation blobs, as instructed. The osmotic pressure is determined by the thermal energy per correlation volume, $\\xi^3$:\n    $$\n    \\Pi \\sim \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{\\xi^3}\n    $$\n    The correlation length $\\xi$ is the characteristic mesh size of the network. A chain segment within a blob of size $\\xi$ consists of $g$ monomers and follows the statistics of an isolated chain in the given solvent. The volume fraction of monomers inside a blob is roughly the same as the overall volume fraction $\\phi$:\n    $$\n    \\phi \\sim \\frac{g v_0}{\\xi^3}\n    $$\n    The size of a chain segment containing $g$ monomers scales as $\\xi \\sim a g^{\\nu}$, where $a \\sim v_0^{1/3}$ is the monomer size and $\\nu$ is the Flory exponent. For theta conditions, the chain behaves as an ideal random walk, so $\\nu = 1/2$.\n    $$\n    \\xi \\sim g^{1/2} \\implies g \\sim \\xi^2\n    $$\n    We combine the two scaling relations to eliminate $g$:\n    $$\n    \\phi \\sim \\frac{\\xi^2}{\\xi^3} = \\frac{1}{\\xi} \\implies \\xi \\sim \\phi^{-1}\n    $$\n    Finally, we substitute this scaling for $\\xi$ into the expression for $\\Pi$:\n    $$\n    \\Pi \\sim \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{\\xi^3} \\sim (\\phi^{-1})^{-3} = \\phi^3\n    $$\n    Therefore, in the semidilute regime under theta conditions, the osmotic pressure scales as $\\Pi \\propto \\phi^3$. It is a known result that for theta solvents, the mean-field Flory-Huggins theory predicts the correct scaling exponent for the semidilute regime, a coincidence that does not hold for good solvents.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Under $\\chi=1/2$, the coefficient of the $\\phi^{2}$ term in the virial expansion of $\\Pi$ vanishes; to leading orders, $\\Pi v_{0}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T) = \\phi/N + (\\tfrac{1}{3})\\phi^{3} + \\mathcal{O}(\\phi^{4})$. Hence, in the dilute regime, $\\Pi \\propto \\phi/N$, while in the semidilute regime, $\\Pi \\propto \\phi^{3}$.**\n- The vanishing of the $\\phi^2$ term and the resulting expansion are correct according to our derivation.\n- The dilute regime scaling $\\Pi \\propto \\phi/N$ is correct.\n- The semidilute regime scaling $\\Pi \\propto \\phi^3$ is correct, as derived from scaling theory. The word \"Hence\" suggests a derivation from the virial expansion, which is formally incorrect as the expansion is for dilute solutions. However, because the FH theory coincidentally gives the correct scaling, this statement leads to the correct physical conclusion. Among the given choices, this option correctly identifies all physical behaviors.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Under $\\chi=1/2$, all interaction contributions vanish; $\\Pi$ equals the ideal pressure of monomers, $\\Pi v_{0}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T) = \\phi$, independent of $N$, in both dilute and semidilute regimes.**\n- The statement that \"all interaction contributions vanish\" is false. Only the pairwise interaction term vanishes; three-body and higher interactions, represented by the $\\phi^3$ term, persist.\n- The formula $\\Pi v_0/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T) = \\phi$ represents the osmotic pressure of a gas of independent monomers, not a solution of polymer chains. This is fundamentally incorrect. The ideal osmotic pressure is due to chains, giving $\\Pi \\propto \\phi/N$.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Under $\\chi=1/2$, the small-$\\phi$ form remains $\\Pi v_{0}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T) \\approx \\phi/N + A\\phi^{2}$ with $A0$, so the semidilute scaling is $\\Pi \\propto \\phi^{2}$.**\n- The claim that the $\\phi^2$ term remains with a positive coefficient ($A0$) is false. The coefficient is $(\\frac{1}{2} - \\chi)$, which is zero for a theta solvent. A positive coefficient characterizes a good solvent.\n- The semidilute scaling of $\\Pi \\propto \\phi^2$ is incorrect for a theta solvent. This scaling is the (incorrect) mean-field prediction for a good solvent.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Under $\\chi=1/2$, the dilute regime obeys $\\Pi \\propto \\phi/N$, but the semidilute regime follows the good-solvent des Cloizeaux scaling $\\Pi \\propto \\phi^{9/4}$.**\n- The dilute regime scaling $\\Pi \\propto \\phi/N$ is stated correctly.\n- However, the scaling $\\Pi \\propto \\phi^{9/4}$ is the established result for the semidilute regime in a *good solvent* (where $\\nu \\approx 3/5$), not a theta solvent. The problem is explicitly set at theta conditions. This option confuses the two cases.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivations, only option A presents the correct physical statements and scaling laws for a polymer solution under theta conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2949436"}, {"introduction": "Real-world polymer samples are rarely composed of chains of a single, uniform length.

A dilute solution of a strong polyelectrolyte is separated from a salt reservoir by a semipermeable membrane. The membrane is permeable to the solvent and small ions but impermeable to the large polyelectrolyte chains.\n\nThe polyelectrolyte solution (the \"inside\" compartment) contains negatively charged polymer chains. The number concentration of monomers is $c_m$, and each monomer carries an effective charge of $-Ze$, where $Z$ is a positive dimensionless number. The total concentration of fixed negative charges on the polymers is therefore $Zc_m$. To maintain charge neutrality, the solution also contains an equivalent concentration, $Zc_m$, of monovalent positive counter-ions that originate from the polymer.\n\nThe salt reservoir (the \"outside\" compartment) contains a monovalent salt (e.g., NaCl) at a concentration $c_s$. This salt dissociates completely into positive and negative ions, each at concentration $c_s$.

We set up the equation:\n$$ k_B T \\left(\\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2} - 2c_s^*\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (Z c_m k_B T) $$\nThe factor of $k_B T$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ \\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2} - 2c_s^* = \\frac{1}{2} Zc_m $$\nTo solve for $c_s^*$, we first isolate the square root term:\n$$ \\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} Zc_m + 2c_s^* $$\nNow, square both sides of the equation:\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} Zc_m + 2c_s^*\\right)^2 $$\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} Zc_m\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2} Zc_m\\right)(2c_s^*) + (2c_s^*)^2 $$\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(Zc_m)^2 + 2Zc_m c_s^* + 4(c_s^*)^2 $$\nThe $4(c_s^*)^2$ term appears on both sides and can be canceled.\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(Zc_m)^2 + 2Zc_m c_s^* $$\nNow, we solve for $c_s^*$.\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}(Zc_m)^2 = 2Zc_m c_s^* $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{4}(Zc_m)^2 = 2Zc_m c_s^* $$\nAssuming $Zc_m \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $2Zc_m$:\n$$ c_s^* = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}(Zc_m)^2}{2Zc_m} $$\n$$ c_s^* = \\frac{3}{8} Zc_m $$\nThis is the final expression for the required reservoir salt concentration.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{3}{8} Z c_m} $$", "id": "172835"}]}
