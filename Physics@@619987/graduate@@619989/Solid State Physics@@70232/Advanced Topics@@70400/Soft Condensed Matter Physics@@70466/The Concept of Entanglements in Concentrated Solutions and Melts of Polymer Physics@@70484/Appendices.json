For a given linear polymer, there exists a critical molecular weight, $M_c$, above which polymer chains become mutually entangled, significantly constraining their motion. This leads to a dramatic change in how the zero-shear viscosity, $\\eta_0$, scales with the molecular weight, $M$.\n\nThe behavior can be summarized by two distinct scaling regimes:\n\n1.  **Unentangled Regime ($M \\le M_c$):** The melt behaves according to the Rouse model. The chains are short enough that they do not form significant topological constraints with each other. In this regime, the zero-shear viscosity is directly proportional to the molecular weight:\n    $$\n    \\eta_0(M) \\propto M\n    $$\n\n2.  **Entangled Regime ($M \\ge M_c$):** The chains are long and form a complex, entangled network. The motion of a single chain is described by the reptation model, where it is confined to a \"tube\" formed by its neighbors.
