First, considering variations $\\delta\\theta(z)$ that are zero at the boundaries ($z=0$ and $z=d$), the integral term must be zero. This yields the Euler-Lagrange equation for the bulk:\n$$ K \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dz^2} = 0 $$\nThe solution to this differential equation is a linear profile: $\\theta(z) = A z + B$.\n\nNext, the boundary terms in the variation $\\delta F_{A}$ must also sum to zero:\n$$ K \\theta'(d) \\delta\\theta(d) + \\left[ W \\theta(0) - K \\theta'(0) \\right] \\delta\\theta(0) = 0 $$\nSince the variation $\\delta\\theta(0)$ at the surface $z=0$ is arbitrary, its coefficient must be zero.

This signifies that the system is in the strong-anchoring regime. The physical meaning of the extrapolation length is the characteristic scale over which surface anchoring forces dominate elastic forces. A small $\\ell$ relative to the system size $d$ implies that the surface enforces its preferred alignment very effectively, and any deviation from this easy axis is confined to a very thin layer near the surface relative to the total cell thickness.
