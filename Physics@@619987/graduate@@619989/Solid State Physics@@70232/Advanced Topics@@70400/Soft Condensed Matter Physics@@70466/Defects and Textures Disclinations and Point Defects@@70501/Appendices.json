This defect creates a displacement field that, in an infinite medium, would be purely radial and correspond to a local volume expansion $\\Delta V$. The solid is characterized by its shear modulus $\\mu$ and Poisson's ratio $\\sigma$.\n\nNow, consider such a solid occupying the half-space $z > 0$, with a planar free surface at $z = 0$. A \"free surface\" is a boundary where the traction (force per unit area) is zero. A single interstitial atom, modeled as a center of dilatation, is located at coordinates $(0, 0, d)$ where $d > 0$.\n\nThe presence of the free surface modifies the total elastic field. The modification can be described by an \"image\" field, which ensures the boundary conditions are met. The interaction of the defect with this image field results in an effective force on the defect, often called an image force.
