Assume nucleation occurs homogeneously and randomly in space. In the Kolmogorov–Johnson–Mehl–Avrami (KJMA) framework, the transformed fraction $X(t)$ is related to the so-called extended transformed fraction $X_{e}(t)$ by Poisson statistics of impingement, and $X_{e}(t)$ is obtained by integrating the $d$-dimensional volume grown by nuclei born at earlier times.

The exponent $n$ is what must be found.\n\nThe extended volume fraction $X_{e}(t)$ represents the sum of the volumes of all crystalline entities if they were allowed to grow without impinging upon one another. It is calculated by integrating the contributions from all nuclei formed up to time $t$. Let $\\dot{N}(t')$ be the nucleation rate density (number of nuclei formed per unit volume per unit time) at time $t'$. The contribution to $X_{e}(t)$ from nuclei formed in the interval $[t', t' + dt']$ is the number of such nuclei, $\\dot{N}(t') dt'$, multiplied by their volume at time $t$, $V_d(t, t')$. Thus, the general expression for the extended volume is:\n$$X_{e}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\dot{N}(t') V_d(t, t') dt'$$\nThe growing objects are $d$-dimensional balls (hyperspheres) with a radius $R(t, t')$ that grows linearly with time: $R(t, t') = G(t - t')$ for a constant growth rate $G$. The volume of a $d$-ball of radius $R$ is given by $V_d(R) = C_d R^d$, where $C_d$ is a geometric factor equal to the volume of a unit $d$-ball. Specifically, $C_d = \\frac{\\pi^{d/2}}{\\Gamma(d/2 + 1)}$, where $\\Gamma(z)$ is the Gamma function.
