The problem is self-contained and has a unique, stable solution.\n-   **Completeness**: All necessary information is provided. The governing equations, geometry, boundary conditions (implicitly), and definitions required for the derivation are stated. The problem is neither underspecified nor overconstrained.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-defined problem in condensed matter physics. I will now proceed with the complete derivation.\n\nThe applied magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}_a$ is directed along the $z$-axis, $\\mathbf{H}_a = H_a \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. Due to the translational invariance in the $y$ and $z$ directions and the orientation of the applied field, the magnetic induction $\\mathbf{B}$ inside the superconductor will have only a $z$-component that depends solely on the $x$ coordinate: $\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{r}) = B(x) \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nWith this form for $\\mathbf{B}$, the Maxwell equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ is automatically satisfied, as $\\frac{\\partial B(x)}{\\partial z} = 0$. The London equation $\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{B}/\\lambda^2$ simplifies to a one-dimensional, second-order ordinary differential equation for $B(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 B(x)}{dx^2} = \\frac{B(x)}{\\lambda^2}\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is\n$$\nB(x) = C_1 \\exp(x/\\lambda) + C_2 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants. For a problem with slab symmetry centered at $x=0$, it is more convenient to use a basis of hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nB(x) = A \\cosh(x/\\lambda) + D \\sinh(x/\\lambda)\n$$\nThe physical situation is symmetric with respect to the plane $x=0$. The external field is uniform, and the slab is centered at the origin. Therefore, the internal field profile $B(x)$ must be an even function of $x$, i.e., $B(x) = B(-x)$. Since $\\cosh(x/\\lambda)$ is an even function and $\\sinh(x/\\lambda)$ is an odd function, this symmetry requirement forces the coefficient $D$ to be zero. The solution must take the form:\n$$\nB(x) = A \\cosh(x/\\lambda)\n$$\nThe constant $A$ is determined by the boundary conditions at the surfaces of the superconductor, $x = \\pm d/2$. The tangential component of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{H}$ must be continuous across any interface. Outside the superconductor, the tangential field is $\\mathbf{H}_a = H_a \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. Inside the superconductor, the relationship between $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{H}$ is $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H}$. For a superconductor, we can take the relative permeability to be unity, so $\\mu = \\mu_0$. Thus, $\\mathbf{H}_{\\text{inside}} = \\mathbf{B}/\\mu_0$.\nThe continuity of the tangential component of $\\mathbf{H}$ at $x=\\pm d/2$ implies:\n$$\nH_a = \\frac{B(\\pm d/2)}{\\mu_0}\n$$\nTherefore, the boundary condition for the magnetic induction $B(x)$ is $B(\\pm d/2) = \\mu_0 H_a$. Let us define $B_a \\equiv \\mu_0 H_a$. Applying this condition at $x=d/2$:\n$$\nB(d/2) = A \\cosh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda}\\right) = B_a\n$$\nSolving for $A$ gives $A = B_a / \\cosh(d/(2\\lambda))$. Substituting this back into the solution for $B(x)$, we obtain the exact magnetic field profile inside the superconducting slab:\n$$\nB(x) = B_a \\frac{\\cosh(x/\\lambda)}{\\cosh(d/(2\\lambda))}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the spatial average of the magnetic induction, $\\bar{B}$, across the slab's thickness:\n$$\n\\bar{B} = \\frac{1}{d} \\int_{-d/2}^{d/2} B(x) \\,dx = \\frac{1}{d} \\frac{B_a}{\\cosh(d/(2\\lambda))} \\int_{-d/2}^{d/2} \\cosh(x/\\lambda) \\,dx\n$$\nThe integral is $\\int \\cosh(x/\\lambda) \\,dx = \\lambda \\sinh(x/\\lambda)$. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-d/2}^{d/2} \\cosh(x/\\lambda) \\,dx = \\lambda \\left[ \\sinh(x/\\lambda) \\right]_{-d/2}^{d/2} = \\lambda \\left( \\sinh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda}\\right) - \\sinh\\left(-\\frac{d}{2\\lambda}\\right) \\right) = 2\\lambda \\sinh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $\\bar{B}$:\n$$\n\\bar{B} = \\frac{B_a}{d} \\frac{2\\lambda \\sinh(d/(2\\lambda))}{\\cosh(d/(2\\lambda))} = B_a \\frac{2\\lambda}{d} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nNow we find the net volumetric magnetization $M$ using the given relation $\\bar{B} = \\mu_0 (H_a + M)$. Rearranging for $M$ and substituting $\\bar{B}$ and $B_a = \\mu_0 H_a$:\n$$\nM = \\frac{\\bar{B}}{\\mu_0} - H_a = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left( (\\mu_0 H_a) \\frac{2\\lambda}{d} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda}\\right) \\right) - H_a = H_a \\left( \\frac{2\\lambda}{d} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{d}{2\\lambda}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nNow we derive the asymptotic forms in the specified limits.\n\n1.

It presents a standard exercise in the application of Ginzburg-Landau theory to the classification of superconductors. All necessary data are provided, and the quantities are physically plausible. We may therefore proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe classification of a superconductor as Type I or Type II is governed by the sign of the surface energy at the interface between a superconducting phase and a normal phase, $\\sigma_{ns}$. This energy is determined by the competition between two length scales characteristic of the superconducting state: the London penetration depth, $\\lambda$, and the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length, $\\xi$. The penetration depth $\\lambda$ is the characteristic distance over which an external magnetic field decays inside the superconductor. The coherence length $\\xi$ is the characteristic distance over which the superconducting order parameter, which describes the density of superconducting charge carriers, can vary significantly. A positive surface energy ($\\sigma_{ns}  0$) disfavors the formation of such interfaces, leading to Type I behavior, while a negative surface energy ($\\sigma_{ns}  0$) makes the creation of interfaces energetically favorable, leading to Type II behavior.\n\nWithin the framework of Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, this competition is encapsulated by a single dimensionless material parameter, known as the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, $\\kappa$. It is defined as the ratio of these two fundamental length scales:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\xi}\n$$\nA detailed calculation in GL theory shows that the sign of the interfacial energy $\\sigma_{ns}$ changes at a critical value of $\\kappa = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n- If $\\kappa  1/\\sqrt{2}$, the coherence length is relatively large compared to the penetration depth. The energy cost of suppressing the order parameter over the distance $\\xi$ dominates the energy gain from magnetic field penetration over the distance $\\lambda$, resulting in a positive interfacial energy ($\\sigma_{ns}  0$). This defines a **Type I** superconductor.\n- If $\\kappa  1/\\sqrt{2}$, the penetration depth is relatively large compared to the coherence length. The energy gain from field penetration dominates the energy cost of creating a normal core, resulting in a negative interfacial energy ($\\sigma_{ns}  0$). This defines a **Type II** superconductor.\n\nThe problem provides the necessary values to compute this parameter:\n- London penetration depth: $\\lambda = 120\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n- Ginzburg-Landau coherence length: $\\xi = 9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nWe can now substitute these values into the definition of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{120\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{9\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{120}{9} = \\frac{40}{3}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives the numerical value:\n$$\n\\kappa \\approx 13.3333...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as required by the problem statement, we obtain:\n$$\n\\kappa \\approx 13.33\n$$\nThis value must be compared to the critical value $\\kappa_c = 1/\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.7071$. Since $\\kappa \\approx 13.33 \\gg 1/\\sqrt{2}$, the material is decisively a **Type II** superconductor.\n\nFor a Type II superconductor, the magnetic response is more complex than that of a simple perfect diamagnet.\n- In the **Meissner state**, for an applied magnetic field $H$ below a lower critical field $H_{c1}$, the superconductor behaves as a perfect diamagnet. It completely expels the magnetic field from its interior, with the field only penetrating the surface over a characteristic depth $\\lambda$. In this regime, its behavior conforms to that of perfect diamagnetism.\n- However, the negative interfacial energy means that for applied fields $H  H_{c1}$, the system can lower its total free energy by allowing magnetic flux to penetrate. This penetration does not occur uniformly but rather in the form of discrete, quantized flux tubes known as Abrikosov vortices. Each vortex consists of a normal-metal core of radius approximately $\\xi$, where the superconducting order parameter is suppressed, surrounded by circulating supercurrents. The magnetic field is high inside the core and decays into the surrounding superconducting material over the length scale $\\lambda$. This state, for $H_{c1}  H  H_{c2}$, is called the **mixed state** or Shubnikov phase.\n- In the mixed state, the material is no longer a perfect diamagnet; it exhibits partial flux penetration. As the external field increases from $H_{c1}$ towards a much higher upper critical field $H_{c2}$, the density of vortices increases until the normal cores begin to overlap. At $H = H_{c2}$, the entire sample transitions to the normal state.\n\nThus, the key deviation from perfect diamagnetism for this material is the existence of the stable mixed state, characterized by the partial penetration of magnetic field in the form of a vortex lattice, which is a direct consequence of its classification as Type II, determined by the calculated value of $\\kappa  1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe problem asks only for the numerical value of the controlling dimensionless parameter. This parameter is $\\kappa$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{13.33}\n$$", "id": "2840871"}]}
