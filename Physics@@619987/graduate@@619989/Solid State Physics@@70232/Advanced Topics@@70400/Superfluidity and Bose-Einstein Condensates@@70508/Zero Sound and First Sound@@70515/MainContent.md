## Introduction
What is sound? On a macroscopic scale, it is a familiar pressure wave, a ripple of collisions passing through a medium. This is the world of '[first sound](@article_id:143731),' governed by the predictable laws of [hydrodynamics](@article_id:158377). But what happens in the ultra-cold, clean environment of a quantum liquid where particles hardly ever collide? Intuition suggests that any vibration should quickly die out, yet something extraordinary occurs: a new, purely quantum form of sound emerges, propagating without the need for collisions. This is '[zero sound](@article_id:142278),' a profound concept that challenges our classical understanding of waves and reveals the deep, collective nature of [quantum matter](@article_id:161610).

This article demystifies these two distinct acoustic phenomena. We will first explore the **Principles and Mechanisms** that differentiate [first sound](@article_id:143731) from its collisionless counterpart, [zero sound](@article_id:142278), uncovering how microscopic quantum interactions give rise to these macroscopic waves. We will then journey through the diverse **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, discovering how physicists use these sound modes as a 'quantum sonar' to probe everything from liquid helium to the dense matter in [neutron stars](@article_id:139189). Finally, a selection of **Hands-On Practices** will provide you with the opportunity to apply these concepts, solidifying your understanding of how to calculate and interpret the properties of these fascinating [collective modes](@article_id:136635).

## Principles and Mechanisms

What is sound? At first glance, the answer seems simple. It’s a travelling vibration. A clap of thunder is the air being violently shoved aside by lightning, and that shove travels to our ears as a wave of pressure. Little parcels of air bump into their neighbours, who bump into their neighbours, and so on. The message is passed along through a frantic series of microscopic collisions. This familiar kind of sound, which relies on the system having enough time to locally thermalize and behave like a continuous fluid, is what physicists call **[first sound](@article_id:143731)**. It's a phenomenon of the **hydrodynamic regime**, where collisions are king.

You might think that's the whole story. But nature, as always, has a few more tricks up her sleeve. What if we had a [system of particles](@article_id:176314) so cold and clean that collisions are rare? What if we tried to send a vibration through it that was so fast—so high-frequency—that the particles simply didn't have time to bump into each other? Surely, the sound must just fizzle out, unable to propagate. But it doesn't. In the strange quantum world of Fermi liquids, something else, something quite magical, can happen. A new kind of sound emerges, one that doesn't need collisions at all. This is **[zero sound](@article_id:142278)**.

Let’s journey into this remarkable world and uncover the principles behind these two distinct symphonies a quantum liquid can play.

### First Sound: The Collective Murmur

Imagine a dense crowd of interacting particles, like the electrons in a metal or the atoms in liquid Helium-3. This isn't just a chaotic gas; it's a **Fermi liquid**, a highly correlated quantum system. If you try to create a low-frequency, long-wavelength density ripple in this liquid, the particles have plenty of time to collide with each other, sharing momentum and energy. They behave like our familiar air molecules, creating a pressure wave that propagates as [first sound](@article_id:143731).

But what determines its speed, $c_1$? It's not just the simple gas-law answer. The interactions between the particles play a crucial role. In Landau's brilliant theory of Fermi liquids, these interactions are captured by a set of numbers called **Landau parameters**, denoted $F_l^s$ (for spin-symmetric interactions) and $F_l^a$ (for spin-antisymmetric ones).

Think of the parameter $F_0^s$ as a measure of the particles' fundamental "sociability." A positive $F_0^s$ means the particles are repulsive; they shove each other away. This makes the liquid "stiffer" and less compressible, causing sound to travel faster. A negative $F_0^s$ means they are attractive, making the liquid "softer."

Then there's $F_1^s$. This parameter is related to how a particle's motion is affected by the flow of its neighbors. A particle moving through the liquid drags a cloud of other interacting particles with it, making it behave as if it were heavier than it actually is. This is the concept of **effective mass**, $m^*$, which is larger than the bare mass $m$ if $F_1^s$ is positive. A heavier particle is more sluggish, which tends to slow down the propagation of sound.

By putting all these pieces together, we can see how the speed of [first sound](@article_id:143731) is a delicate balance of these microscopic effects. The speed is determined by the system's [compressibility](@article_id:144065) (related to $F_0^s$) and the inertia of its constituents (related to $F_1^s$ and the effective mass). A detailed calculation reveals a beautiful formula for a 3D Fermi liquid [@problem_id:267674]:

$$
c_1 = v_F \sqrt{ \frac{1}{3} (1 + F_0^s) \left(1 + \frac{F_1^s}{3}\right) }
$$

where $v_F$ is the **Fermi velocity**, the [characteristic speed](@article_id:173276) of the fastest-moving particles in the system. This equation tells us a profound story: the macroscopic speed of sound is directly dictated by the strength and nature of the microscopic quantum interactions.

### Zero Sound: The Collisionless Symphony

Now, let's turn up the frequency. If the frequency of our wave, $\omega$, becomes much larger than the average rate of collisions between particles, $1/\tau$, we enter the **[collisionless regime](@article_id:195035)** ($\omega\tau \gg 1$). The domino-like chain of collisions is too slow to keep up. How can a wave propagate?

This is where Lev Landau's genius shines. He realized that a particle in a Fermi liquid doesn't just feel its immediate neighbours; it feels the average force, or **mean field**, created by *all* the other particles. Imagine a stadium wave. You stand up not because the person next to you physically nudged you, but because you see the collective pattern of the wave approaching and you react to it. Zero sound is the "stadium wave" of a Fermi liquid. It's a [self-sustaining oscillation](@article_id:272094) of the mean field itself, which in turn causes the particles to move, which in turn sustains the oscillating mean field. The Fermi surface—the boundary in momentum space separating occupied from unoccupied states—begins to breathe and undulate, and this distortion propagates through space.

The transition from the collision-dominated world of [first sound](@article_id:143731) to the collisionless world of [zero sound](@article_id:142278) isn't abrupt. There is a **crossover frequency**, $\omega_c$, where the two descriptions meet. We can estimate this frequency by asking: at what point does the attenuation (or damping) of [first sound](@article_id:143731), which gets worse at high frequencies, become as large as the intrinsic damping of [zero sound](@article_id:142278) (which is due to the eventual, rare collisions)? This crossover marks the frequency above which it's more "efficient" for the system to propagate the wave via the collective mean field rather than by individual collisions [@problem_id:267675].

Unlike [first sound](@article_id:143731), whose existence is a given in a fluid, [zero sound](@article_id:142278) is a more delicate creature. It can only exist under certain conditions.

First, it demands a repulsive interaction. To sustain the propagating distortion, there must be a restoring force. If particles are trying to bunch up somewhere, a repulsive force pushes them back, overshooting the equilibrium and driving the oscillation. This means the Landau parameter $F_0^s$ must be positive. If the interaction were attractive ($F_0^s < 0$), the particles would happily clump together, and the wave would be destroyed. The critical dividing line is precisely $F_0^s = 0$ [@problem_id:267766]. For any repulsive interaction, no matter how weak, a [zero sound](@article_id:142278) mode can propagate.

Second, the wave must be fast. Specifically, the speed of [zero sound](@article_id:142278), $c_0$, must be greater than the Fermi velocity, $v_F$. Imagine a boat trying to surf a wave. If the wave is faster than the boat, the boat can be carried along. But if the boat is faster, it just plows through the wave. In a Fermi liquid, the particles are the "boats," moving at speeds up to $v_F$. If the [zero sound](@article_id:142278) wave were slower than $v_F$, the particles could easily "surf" it, stealing its energy and causing the wave to rapidly dissipate. This process is called **Landau damping**. To survive, the [zero sound](@article_id:142278) wave must outrun all the quasiparticles in the liquid, i.e., $c_0 > v_F$. As the interaction strength $F_0^s$ increases, the liquid gets "stiffer" and the speed of [zero sound](@article_id:142278) increases, moving further away from the dangerous $v_F$ limit [@problem_id:267649].

### A Richer Symphony: Waves of Spin and Shear

Is a propagating density fluctuation the only kind of music a Fermi liquid can play? Absolutely not. The theory reveals a whole orchestra of possibilities.

What if, instead of creating a wave of particle density, we create a wave of **[spin polarization](@article_id:163544)**? Imagine aligning all the particle spins (which act like tiny magnets) in one region pointing up, and in the next region pointing down. If the interactions between particles depend on their spin orientation—described by the spin-antisymmetric Landau parameter $F_0^a$—this pattern of magnetism can propagate as a wave. This is **spin [zero sound](@article_id:142278)** [@problem_id:267651]. The logic is identical to density [zero sound](@article_id:142278), but the waving quantity is spin, and the restoring force is provided by the spin-dependent part of the interaction.

Even more remarkably, at high frequencies, a Fermi liquid can behave like an elastic solid. A normal, everyday liquid like water cannot support a **transverse** or **shear** wave. If you try to "jiggle" water sideways, the motion just dissipates. But in the collisionless limit, the Fermi liquid develops a kind of "quantum rigidity." A transverse jiggle can propagate as a **transverse [zero sound](@article_id:142278)** mode [@problem_id:267748]. This is only possible if the interactions that affect particle currents, described by the Landau parameter $F_1^s$, are sufficiently strong (in this case, sufficiently repulsive, $F_1^s > 6$). The liquid jiggles like a jelly, a truly non-intuitive, purely quantum mechanical effect.

The richness doesn't even stop there. The distortions of the Fermi surface are not limited to simple shapes. They can have more complex angular structures, like the quadrupole shape of a d-wave, leading to even more exotic [zero sound](@article_id:142278) modes, provided the corresponding interaction parameters (like $F_2^s$) are large enough [@problem_id:267678].

### Living on the Edge: Sound and Stability

The Landau parameters don't just give rise to new waves; they also govern the very stability of the liquid. What happens if the attractive interaction becomes too strong? Let's look at [first sound](@article_id:143731) again. The formula tells us that its speed depends on $\sqrt{1+F_0^s}$. As the interaction becomes more attractive, $F_0^s$ becomes more negative. If $F_0^s$ were to reach $-1$, the speed of [first sound](@article_id:143731) would drop to zero! [@problem_id:267682]

A sound speed of zero is a dramatic event. It means the compressibility of the liquid has become infinite; it costs no energy at all to squeeze it. The system is unstable. It is on the verge of a **[quantum phase transition](@article_id:142414)**, where it will spontaneously collapse or separate into regions of high and low density. The vanishing of the [first sound](@article_id:143731) velocity is the canary in the coal mine, a clear signal of this impending instability. In other scenarios, for different [attractive interactions](@article_id:161644), the system may not propagate a wave at all but instead exhibit purely decaying, or **overdamped**, modes that signify a rapid relaxation towards a new, more stable state [@problem_id:267772].

From the familiar murmur of [first sound](@article_id:143731) to the exotic symphony of [zero sound](@article_id:142278) modes, the study of collective excitations in Fermi liquids reveals a world of profound and beautiful physics. It shows how simple, intuitive concepts like sound are transformed in the quantum realm, and how the cooperative dance of billions of interacting particles can be governed by a few fundamental parameters, giving birth to new phenomena and even heralding the dramatic collapse of an entire state of matter.
