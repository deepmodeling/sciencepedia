The Bose-Hubbard model provides a powerful theoretical playground to explore the transition between a superfluid and a Mott insulator, a state where particles are localized. This problem asks you to investigate the system in the limit of strong interactions ($U$) and negligible particle movement or hopping ($t$), which defines the Mott insulating phase. By calculating the energy gap required to create a particle-number fluctuation, you will uncover the fundamental energy cost that kinetic energy must overcome to \"melt\" the insulator and establish the delocalized, coherent state of a superfluid [@problem_id:220101].
