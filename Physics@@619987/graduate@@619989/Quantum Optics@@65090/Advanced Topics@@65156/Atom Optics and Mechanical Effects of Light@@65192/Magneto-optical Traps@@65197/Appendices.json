The first stage of this process is laser cooling, which is used to slow down a beam of Rubidium-87 ($^{87}\\text{Rb}$) atoms originating from a high-temperature oven.\n\nConsider a single $^{87}\\text{Rb}$ atom that is traveling along the z-axis with an initial speed $v_i$. To slow it down, a laser beam is directed along the z-axis, opposing the atom's motion. The atom absorbs photons from this laser beam. Each time the atom absorbs a photon, its momentum is reduced. Although the atom subsequently re-emits a photon, the emission direction is random. Therefore, over many absorption-emission cycles, the momentum kicks from the emitted photons average to zero and do not contribute to a net change in the atom's momentum along the z-axis.\n\nYou are given the following physical parameters:\n- Mass of a $^{87}\\text{Rb}$ atom, $m = 1.443 \\times 10^{-25} \\, \\text{kg}$\n- Initial speed of the atom, $v_i = 300 \\, \\text{m/s}$\n- Wavelength of the cooling laser light, $\\lambda = 780 \\, \\text{nm}$\n- Planck's constant, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34} \\, \\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n\nCalculate the minimum number of photons an atom must absorb to be brought to rest.
