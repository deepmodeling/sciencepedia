The source and drain voltages are set to zero, $V_{s}=V_{d}=0$, while the gate voltage $V_{g}$ is varied. The total capacitance of the quantum dot is the sum of the individual capacitances:\n$$C_{\\Sigma} = C_{g} + C_{s} + C_{d}$$\nThe total charge $Q$ on the dot is related to the dot's potential $V_{dot}$ and the external voltages.
