Its operation relies on a phenomenon where a single photon can disrupt the superconducting state of a biased nanowire.\n\nConsider a simplified model of an SNSPD consisting of a single, straight superconducting nanowire with a rectangular cross-section of width $w$ and uniform thickness. The wire is cooled to a temperature well below its superconducting critical temperature and is biased with a DC current $I_b$. The critical current of the wire, which is the maximum current it can carry without resistance, is denoted by $I_c$. By design, the bias current is set such that $0 < I_b < I_c$.\n\nThe detection mechanism is based on the \"hotspot model,\" which can be described as follows:\n1.  The absorption of a photon with energy $E_{ph}$ by the wire creates a localized, circular, non-superconducting (\"normal\") region, referred to as a hotspot. We assume this hotspot is centered on the wire's longitudinal axis and has a diameter $L$. The energy required to create the hotspot is related to its size by the phenomenological equation $E_{ph} = \\alpha L^2$, where $\\alpha$ is a positive constant that depends on the wire's material properties and thermodynamic conditions.\n2.  The bias current $I_b$, unable to flow through the resistive hotspot, is forced to redistribute itself into the remaining superconducting sections of the wire on either side of the hotspot.\n3.  A successful detection event is triggered if and only if this current redistribution causes the current density in the remaining superconducting side channels to exceed the material's critical current density. This event leads to a cascade that forms a resistive barrier across the entire width of the wire, generating a measurable voltage pulse.\n\nBased on this model, derive an expression for the minimum photon energy, $E_{ph, min}$, that is required to trigger a detection event. Express your answer in terms of the parameters $I_b$, $I_c$, $w$, and $\\alpha$.", "solution": "We model the straight superconducting nanowire as a strip of width $w$ and uniform thickness $t$. The critical current $I_{c}$ corresponds to a critical current density $J_{c}$ given by $J_{c} = I_{c}/(w t)$ when the current is uniformly distributed across the full cross section.\n\nUpon absorption of a photon of energy $E_{ph}$, a circular normal hotspot of diameter $L$ forms at the center of the strip. This removes a central portion of the cross section from carrying supercurrent. The remaining superconducting cross section is effectively two side channels whose total available width is $w - L$, so the available area is $(w - L)t$. The bias current $I_{b}$ must then redistribute through this reduced area, giving a redistributed current density\n$$\nJ_{\\text{side}} = \\frac{I_{b}}{(w - L)t}.\n$$\nA detection event is triggered if and only if this redistributed current density reaches or exceeds the material’s critical current density, i.e.,\n$$\nJ_{\\text{side}} \\geq J_{c}.\n$$\nAt the threshold, we set equality:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{b}}{(w - L)t} = \\frac{I_{c}}{w t}.\n$$\nCancelling $t$ and solving for $L$ gives\n$$\nI_{b} w = I_{c}(w - L) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad L_{\\min} = w \\left(1 - \\frac{I_{b}}{I_{c}}\\right).\n$$\nThe hotspot energy-size relation is $E_{ph} = \\alpha L^{2}$.

In its simplest circuit configuration, it is driven by an ideal DC current source with bias current $I_b$ and shunted by a parallel resistor with resistance $R_s$. The purpose of the shunt resistor is to ensure the detector resets after a photon detection event.\n\nThe electrothermal behavior of the SNSPD after a photon strikes can be described by a simplified bistable model. The detection event creates a localized normal-conducting region (a \"hotspot\") within the superconducting nanowire.\n\n1.  **Superconducting State:** With no hotspot, the nanowire has zero resistance, and the voltage across it, $V_d$, is zero. The entire bias current flows through the detector: $I_d = I_b$.\n\n2.  **Normal State:** When a hotspot with normal-state resistance $R_N$ is present, a non-zero voltage $V_d$ develops across the detector. This hotspot is thermally stable and persists only if the current flowing through the detector, $I_d$, is above a certain threshold known as the \"retrapping current,\" $I_r$. If $I_d$ falls below $I_r$, the hotspot collapses, and the detector \"retraps\" into the zero-voltage superconducting state.\n\nThe steady-state I-V characteristic for the detector in the presence of a hotspot is thus given by $V_d = I_d R_N$, valid only for $I_d \\ge I_r$. If the circuit conditions force $I_d < I_r$, the detector resets, and its operating point returns to $V_d = 0$.\n\nIf the shunt resistance $R_s$ is too large, the current $I_d$ may not drop below $I_r$ after a detection. In this case, the detector remains in the resistive state, a phenomenon known as \"latching\". To ensure proper operation, $R_s$ must be chosen to be small enough to guarantee reset.\n\nUsing a load-line analysis of the shunted detector circuit, derive an expression for the maximum possible shunt resistance, $R_{s,max}$, that guarantees the SNSPD will always thermally reset after a photon detection.
