Each atom is characterized by three relevant energy levels: a ground state (Level 1), a metastable upper lasing state (Level 2), and a short-lived pump state (Level 3). The energies are ordered such that $E_1 < E_2 < E_3$.\n\nAn external pump excites atoms from the ground state to the pump state. From there, they rapidly decay to the metastable state. The lasing action corresponds to the stimulated emission of photons as atoms transition from Level 2 back to the ground state, which serves as the lower lasing level.\n\nUnder steady-state pumping conditions, the lifetime of the pump state is so brief that its population, $N_3$, can be considered negligible compared to the populations of the other two levels, $N_1$ and $N_2$.\n\nThe condition for light amplification, known as population inversion, is achieved when the population of the upper lasing level exceeds that of the lower lasing level.
