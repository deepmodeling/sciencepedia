The cavity is filled with a solid-state gain medium of refractive index $n$. This medium is modeled as a four-level atomic system, which is optically pumped to achieve a population inversion between two of its energy levels, the upper laser level (population density $N_2$) and the lower laser level (population density $N_1$). The transition between these levels has a frequency $\\nu_0$ and a stimulated emission cross-section at line center given by $\\sigma(\\nu_0)$. For an ideal four-level system, the lower laser level $N_1$ is depopulated so rapidly that its population can be considered negligible, i.e., $N_1 \\approx 0$. Thus, the population inversion density is $\\Delta N = N_2 - N_1 \\approx N_2$.\n\nIn addition to losses from the mirrors transmitting light, the gain medium itself introduces a distributed optical loss due to scattering and absorption, which can be described by a loss coefficient $\\alpha_s$.
