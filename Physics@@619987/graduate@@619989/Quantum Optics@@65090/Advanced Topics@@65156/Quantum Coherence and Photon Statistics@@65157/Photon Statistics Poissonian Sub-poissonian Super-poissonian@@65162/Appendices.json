A key measure of the deviation from Poissonian statistics is the Mandel Q parameter. When light is incident on a photodetector, it generates a photocurrent, which is a stream of electrons.

This problem explores the fundamental relationship between the input photon statistics and the output electron statistics.\n\n**Background:**\n\n1.  Consider a beam of light incident on a photodetector. The number of photons, $n$, arriving in a given time interval is a random variable described by a probability distribution $P(n)$.
