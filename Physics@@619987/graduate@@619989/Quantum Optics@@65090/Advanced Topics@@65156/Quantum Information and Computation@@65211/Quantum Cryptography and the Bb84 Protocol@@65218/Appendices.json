She intercepts every qubit from Alice, measures it in a basis of her choosing, and then sends a new qubit to Bob, prepared in the state she measured. Eve does not know Alice's basis choice for each qubit. Her strategy is to choose her measurement basis probabilistically: she selects the Z-basis with probability $p$ and the X-basis with probability $1-p$.\n\nAfter the transmission, Alice and Bob perform sifting: they communicate over a public channel to compare their basis choices and discard any bits for which they used different bases.
