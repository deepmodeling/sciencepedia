This practice takes you back to first principles, using classical electromagnetism to derive the fundamental relationship between the pressure $P$ and energy density $u$ of an isotropic radiation field. By calculating the average Lorentz force on the walls of a perfectly conducting cavity, you will uncover the crucial equation of state for a photon gas, $P = u/3$, which forms a cornerstone for the thermodynamic study of radiation [@problem_id:681569].", "problem": "An isotropic, unpolarized electromagnetic field is contained within a large cavity with perfectly conducting walls. This radiation field has a total time-averaged energy density $u$. The radiation exerts a pressure $P$ on the walls of the cavity.\n\nDerive the fundamental relation between the radiation pressure $P$ and the energy density $u$ by directly calculating the Lorentz force on a flat section of the conducting wall. Your final answer should be the ratio $P/u$.\n\nTo guide your derivation, follow these steps:\n1.  Model the isotropic field as a superposition of incoherent plane waves incident from all directions over a hemisphere. For an isotropic field of total energy density $u$, the energy density per unit solid angle is uniform and given by $u_{\\Omega} = u/(4\\pi)$. The energy density of a single incident plane wave is denoted $u_{\\text{wave}}$.\n2.  Consider a single monochromatic plane wave of arbitrary polarization incident on the wall at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the normal. The wall lies in the $xy$-plane at $z=0$, with the conductor occupying the $z<0$ region.\n3.  Calculate the total electric and magnetic fields in the region $z>0$ by applying the boundary conditions for a perfect conductor.\n4.  The time-averaged force per unit area on the wall is given by the Lorentz force, $\\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\sigma \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{K} \\times \\mathbf{B} \\rangle$, where $\\sigma$ is the surface charge density, $\\mathbf{K}$ is the surface current density, and $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ are the fields just outside the conductor. The factor of $1/2$ accounts for the fact that the fields inside the perfect conductor are zero. The surface charge and current are related to the fields at the surface by $\\sigma = \\epsilon_0 (\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\cdot \\mathbf{E})$ and $\\mathbf{K} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}(\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} \\times \\mathbf{B})$, where $\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}=\\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$ is the outward normal from the conductor.\n5.  Derive the pressure $P(\\theta)$ exerted by this single wave, showing it is independent of polarization, and relate it to $u_{\\text{wave}}$.\n6.  Integrate the pressure contribution from all incident waves over the appropriate solid angle to find the total pressure $P$ in terms of the total energy density $u$. Finally, determine the ratio $P/u$.\n\nYou may use the following constants: permeability of free space $\\mu_0$, permittivity of free space $\\epsilon_0$, and the speed of light in vacuum $c$.", "solution": "1.  **Pressure from a Single Wave:** The time-averaged pressure exerted by a single plane wave with energy density $u_{\\text{wave}}$ incident on a perfectly reflecting surface at an angle $\\theta$ to the normal is given by $P(\\theta) = 2 u_{\\text{wave}} \\cos^2\\theta$. This standard result can be derived from the Lorentz force or Maxwell's stress tensor. It accounts for the change in the wave's momentum upon reflection and is independent of polarization for unpolarized light.\n\n2.  **Isotropic Radiation Field:** For an isotropic radiation field with a total energy density $u$, the energy is distributed uniformly over all directions. The pressure on the wall is caused by waves incident from a hemisphere of solid angles. The energy density of these incident waves is thus half the total, $u_{\\text{inc}} = u/2$. The incident energy density per unit solid angle is uniform, given by $\\frac{du_{\\text{inc}}}{d\\Omega} = \\frac{u_{\\text{inc}}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{u}{4\\pi}$.\n\n3.  **Integrating the Pressure:** The total pressure $P$ is found by integrating the pressure contribution from all incident waves over the hemisphere.
