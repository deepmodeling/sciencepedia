The investigation consists of two separate experimental procedures.\n\nIn the first experiment (the \"fluctuation\" experiment), all external fields are turned off, and the probe undergoes rotational Brownian motion due to thermal collisions with the liquid's molecules. The probe's orientation angle, $\\theta(t)$, is recorded over time. The statistical analysis of this random motion reveals that the mean-squared angular displacement over a time interval $\\Delta t$ is directly proportional to the interval, following the equation $\\langle (\\Delta\\theta)^2 \\rangle = C \\Delta t$.

From the collected data, the constant $C$ is measured to be $0.3312 \\text{ rad}^2/\\text{s}$.\n\nIn the second experiment (the \"dissipation\" experiment), a constant external torque, $\\tau_{ext} = 2.50 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}$, is applied to the probe. The probe accelerates until it reaches a constant terminal angular velocity, $\\omega_{term}$, at which point the applied torque is perfectly balanced by the viscous drag torque from the liquid. The drag torque is described by the relation $\\tau_{drag} = -\\gamma_r \\omega$, where $\\gamma_r$ is the rotational friction coefficient. The measured terminal angular velocity is $\\omega_{term} = 10.0 \\text{ rad}/\\text{s}$.\n\nUsing the results from both experiments, calculate the value of the product $D_r \\gamma_r$.
