In this case, the uniform superfluid state can become unstable towards collapse, where particles aggregate in a small region of space. A standard Bogoliubov analysis of the mean-field equations of motion reveals that the uniform state is always unstable to long-wavelength (wavevector $k \\to 0$) perturbations for any non-zero attractive interaction. This is a lattice version of the Jeans instability and leads to a global collapse whose properties depend on the overall system size.\n\nHowever, a different, intrinsic instability can occur at short wavelengths, which is independent of the system size. This corresponds to a rapid, local density modulation, where the superfluid becomes unstable against the formation of dense clusters at the scale of the lattice spacing. This instability is signaled by the softening of the Bogoliubov excitation mode at the edge of the Brillouin zone.\n\nUsing a mean-field approach (equivalent to the discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equation), determine the critical ratio $(|U|/J)_c$ at which the uniform superfluid state with an average filling of one particle per site, $n=1$, becomes unstable to short-wavelength perturbations.", "solution": "1.
