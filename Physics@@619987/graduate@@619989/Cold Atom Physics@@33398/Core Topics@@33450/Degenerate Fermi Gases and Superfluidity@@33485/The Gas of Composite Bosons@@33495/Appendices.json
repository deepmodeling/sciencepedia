This problem [@problem_id:1273831] demonstrates one of the most remarkable consequences of compositeness: the suppression of the three-body loss rate. You will calculate this rate by considering the different length scales involved—the large scattering length governing interactions and the small molecular size required for recombination—revealing why gases of composite bosons can be surprisingly long-lived.", "problem": "Consider a dilute gas of identical composite bosons at zero temperature. These bosons are weakly-bound dimers, each formed from two distinguishable fermionic atoms. Each dimer has a total mass $m_d$ and a characteristic size (short-range scale) $r_0$. At low energies, the interaction between any two dimers is dominated by s-wave scattering, which can be described by a large, positive scattering length $a_{dd}$, satisfying the condition $a_{dd} \\gg r_0$.\n\nIn this system, the leading loss mechanism is three-body recombination, where three dimers collide and are converted into more deeply bound states, effectively removing them from the gas. The density of dimers, $n_d$, thus decreases according to the rate equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_d}{dt} = -K_3 n_d^3\n$$\nwhere $K_3$ is the three-body recombination rate constant.\n\nFor comparison, consider a gas of *elementary* (point-like) bosons with the same mass $m_d$ and scattering length $a_{dd}$.

For large scattering lengths $a_{dd} \\gg r_0$, the colliding dimers primarily interact at a distance of order $a_{dd}$, while the recombination event requires an overlap on the scale of the dimer size, $r_0$.
