Even without interactions, the Pauli exclusion principle dictates that fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, leading to a substantial ground-state energy and a corresponding \"degeneracy pressure.\" This exercise challenges you to connect this microscopic quantum pressure to a macroscopic dynamical property, the speed of sound, providing a crucial baseline for understanding more complex, interacting systems [@problem_id:1237361].", "problem": "A degenerate Fermi gas is a state of matter consisting of fermions at temperatures low enough that quantum mechanical effects dominate their behavior. Consider a system of non-interacting spin-1/2 fermions, each with mass $m$, confined to a three-dimensional volume $V$. The energy of a single particle is given by the non-relativistic dispersion relation $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{p}) = \\frac{|\\mathbf{p}|^2}{2m}$. At absolute zero temperature ($T=0$), all energy states up to a maximum energy, the Fermi energy $E_F$, are occupied, and all states above it are empty. The momentum corresponding to this energy is the Fermi momentum, $p_F$, and the associated velocity is the Fermi velocity, $v_F = p_F/m$.\n\nThe propagation of density waves in this medium can be described by a speed of sound, $c_s$. In a fluid, the square of the speed of sound is related to the change in pressure $P$ with respect to a change in mass density $\\rho$. Equivalently, it can be expressed in terms of the number density $n=N/V$ as:\n$$c_s^2 = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial n}$$\nAt $T=0$, any process is inherently isentropic, so the derivative is taken at constant entropy. Your task is to determine the speed of sound $c_s$ in this zero-temperature, 3D non-interacting Fermi gas.\n\nExpress your final answer as a function of the Fermi velocity $v_F$.", "solution": "The speed of sound $c_s$ is given by $c_s^2 = \\frac{1}{m} \\frac{dP}{dn}$. To find this, we first need to determine how the pressure $P$ of the Fermi gas depends on its number density $n = N/V$.\n\nThe pressure at zero temperature can be found from the total energy $E_{tot}$ using the thermodynamic relation $P = -(\\frac{\\partial E_{tot}}{\\partial V})_N$. So, our first step is to find the total energy of the gas.\n\n**1. Density of States**\n\nFor non-interacting spin-1/2 fermions in a 3D box of volume $V$, the number of quantum states in a momentum-space spherical shell of radius $p$ and thickness $dp$ is given by:\n$$d\\mathcal{N}_{states} = 2 \\times \\frac{V \\cdot 4\\pi p^2 dp}{(2\\pi\\hbar)^3}$$\nThe factor of 2 accounts for the two possible spin projections (spin-up and spin-down). The energy is $\\epsilon = p^2/(2m)$, which implies $p = \\sqrt{2m\\epsilon}$ and $dp = \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{2m\\epsilon}} d\\epsilon$. Substituting these into the expression for $d\\mathcal{N}_{states}$:\n$$d\\mathcal{N}_{states} = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^3} (2m\\epsilon) \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{2m\\epsilon}} d\\epsilon = \\frac{V(2m)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2\\hbar^3} \\sqrt{\\epsilon} d\\epsilon$$\nThis gives the density of states $g(\\epsilon) = \\frac{d\\mathcal{N}_{states}}{d\\epsilon}$:\n$$g(\\epsilon) = \\frac{V(2m)^{3/2}}{2\\pi^2\\hbar^3} \\epsilon^{1/2}$$\n\n**2.

Pressure**\n\nTo calculate pressure, we express $E_{tot}$ as a function of $N$ and $V$ by substituting the expression for $E_F(n)$:\n$$E_{tot}(N, V) = \\frac{3}{5} N \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (3\\pi^2 (N/V))^{2/3} \\right) = \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{\\hbar^2 (3\\pi^2)^{2/3}}{2m} N^{5/3} V^{-2/3}$$\nNow we compute the pressure:\n$$P = - \\left(\\frac{\\partial E_{tot}}{\\partial V}\\right)_N = - \\frac{3}{5} \\frac{\\hbar^2 (3\\pi^2)^{2/3}}{2m} N^{5/3} \\left(-\\frac{2}{3} V^{-5/3}\\right)$$\n$$P = \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{\\hbar^2 (3\\pi^2)^{2/3}}{2m} \\frac{N^{5/3}}{V^{5/3}} = \\frac{1}{5} \\frac{\\hbar^2 (3\\pi^2)^{2/3}}{m} n^{5/3}$$\n\n**5.

Expressing the result in terms of Fermi Velocity**\n\nThe Fermi velocity $v_F$ is defined through the Fermi energy: $E_F = \\frac{1}{2}mv_F^2$. We also have the expression for $E_F$ in terms of $n$:\n$$E_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $E_F$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}mv_F^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3} \\implies v_F^2 = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m^2} (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3}$$\nComparing this with our expression for $c_s^2$:\n$$c_s^2 = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m^2} (3\\pi^2 n)^{2/3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} v_F^2$$\nTaking the square root gives the final result for the speed of sound:\n$$c_s = \\frac{v_F}{\\sqrt{3}}$$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{v_F}{\\sqrt{3}}} $$", "id": "1237361"}, {"introduction": "Having established the behavior of an ideal Fermi gas, we now take a crucial step towards realism by introducing weak interactions between particles.
