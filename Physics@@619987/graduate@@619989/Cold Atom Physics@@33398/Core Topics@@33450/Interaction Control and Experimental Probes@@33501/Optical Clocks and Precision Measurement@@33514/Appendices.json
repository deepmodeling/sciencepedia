This requires the laser's frequency to be tightly \"locked\" to the atomic resonance, a process that relies on a feedback loop. This loop, often a Proportional-Integral (PI) servo, continuously measures the frequency difference and applies a correction.\n\nThis exercise [@problem_id:1257064] provides a foundational analysis of such a feedback system. By calculating the servo's unity-gain frequency, you will explore a key metric of its performance—the bandwidth over which it can effectively suppress noise. This is a crucial practical skill that connects the abstract parameters of control theory to the physical components of a laser stabilization system.", "problem": "In an optical clock experiment, a narrow-linewidth laser is stabilized to a high-Q atomic resonance. The stabilization is achieved using a digital feedback servo loop. The loop works as follows: the frequency difference between the laser and the atomic resonance, $\\delta\\nu$, is converted into a voltage error signal, $V_{err}$. This conversion is characterized by a discriminator with a slope $D$, in units of V/Hz. The error signal is then fed into a digital Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, which runs at a sampling period of $T_s$. The controller generates a correction voltage, $V_c$, which is applied to an actuator that tunes the laser's frequency. The laser's frequency response to the correction voltage is given by a tuning coefficient $K_{laser}$, in units of Hz/V.\n\nFor frequencies $f$ much smaller than the sampling rate $1/T_s$, the transfer function of the digital PI controller can be well-approximated by its continuous-time analog:\n$$\nC(f) = g_p + \\frac{g_i}{j 2\\pi f T_s}\n$$\nwhere $g_p$ is the dimensionless proportional gain and $g_i$ is the dimensionless integral gain. The term $j$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe plant (the system being controlled, i.e., the discriminator and laser actuator) is assumed to have a flat frequency response in the range of interest. The total open-loop gain of the servo, $G_{OL}(f)$, is the product of the controller and plant transfer functions. We are interested in the unity-gain frequency, $f_u$, which is a key metric for the servo's bandwidth. The unity-gain frequency is defined as the frequency at which the magnitude of the open-loop gain is equal to one: $|G_{OL}(f_u)| = 1$.\n\nAssume that any time delays in the loop (e.g., from analog-to-digital conversion and computation) primarily affect the phase of the open-loop gain and can be neglected when calculating its magnitude. Also, assume the condition $g_p D K_{laser}  1$ holds, ensuring stability at low frequencies.\n\nCalculate the unity-gain frequency, $f_u$, of this laser-locking servo system in terms of the given parameters: $g_p$, $g_i$, $T_s$, $D$, and $K_{laser}$.", "solution": "1.

While Ramsey spectroscopy is the standard technique, its performance is often limited by decoherence, the loss of quantum phase information. For clocks based on trapped atoms, a primary source of this decoherence is the atoms' own thermal motion, which causes fluctuating Doppler shifts.\n\nThis problem [@problem_id:1257151] explores how a clever quantum control protocol, the spin-echo sequence, can be used to mitigate this effect. By calculating the final Ramsey fringe contrast, you will quantitatively see how the sequence reverses the phase scrambling caused by thermal motion.

The spin-echo sequence is designed to mitigate this dephasing.\n\nAssuming the atom's motion can be described by classical mechanics, and that the pulses are instantaneous, calculate the contrast $\\mathcal{C}$ of the Ramsey fringes at the end of the sequence.
