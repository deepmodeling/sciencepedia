It arises from the coupling between a two-atom scattering state (the open channel) and a molecular bound state (the closed channel). The resonance occurs at a magnetic field $B$ where the energies of these two channels are degenerate.\n\nConsider two distinguishable ultracold atoms, A and B, which can form a molecule M. In the presence of a uniform magnetic field $B$, the threshold energies of the open and closed channels (at zero kinetic energy) are given by a simple linear model:\n- Open channel (free atoms A and B): $E_{\\text{open}}(B) = (\\mu_A + \\mu_B) B$\n- Closed channel (molecule M): $E_{\\text{closed}}(B) = E_{c,0} + \\mu_M B$\n\nHere, $\\mu_A$ and $\\mu_B$ are the magnetic moments of atoms A and B, respectively, and $\\mu_M$ is the magnetic moment of the molecule M. $E_{c,0}$ is the energy of the molecular state relative to the two-atom dissociation threshold at zero magnetic field.\n\nThe experiment is conducted in an optical dipole trap (ODT), created by a single laser beam of intensity $I$ and frequency $\\omega$.
