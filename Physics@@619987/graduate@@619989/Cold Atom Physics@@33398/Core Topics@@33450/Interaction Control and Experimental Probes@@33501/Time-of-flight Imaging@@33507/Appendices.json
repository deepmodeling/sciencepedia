Component 1 consists of $N_1$ atoms of mass $m_1$, and component 2 consists of $N_2$ atoms of mass $m_2$. Due to their mutual repulsion, the two condensates are spatially separated within the trap. The total initial repulsive interaction energy between the two species is given by $U_{12}$.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the trapping potential is abruptly switched off. The condensates are then free to expand into vacuum, a process known as time-of-flight (TOF). During the expansion, the initial potential and interaction energies are converted into kinetic energy. The initial inter-species repulsion causes the centers of mass of the two clouds to accelerate away from each other.\n\nAssuming the center of mass of the entire two-component system is initially at rest, calculate the magnitude of the asymptotic relative velocity, $v_{\\text{rel}}$, between the centers of mass of the two condensates after a long expansion time.\n\nFor your calculation, you must make a key simplifying physical assumption: the initial inter-species repulsion energy, $U_{12}$, is entirely and exclusively converted into the kinetic energy associated with the relative motion of the two centers of mass. All other initial stored energies (e.g., intra-species interactions, trap potential energy) contribute only to the internal kinetic energy of each cloud's expansion, but not to the relative motion between them.", "solution": "1.
