This practice [@problem_id:1226700] challenges you to quantify the central requirement for this process to succeed—the adiabatic condition—connecting the abstract theoretical requirement to the concrete experimental parameters of the laser pulses.", "problem": "A four-level atomic system is being considered for population transfer from a ground state $|1\\rangle$ to another ground state $|2\\rangle$. The states $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ are assumed to be degenerate, $E_1 = E_2 = 0$. The transfer is mediated by an excited state $|3\\rangle$ with energy $E_3 = \\hbar\\omega_{31}$. Unlike a standard three-level $\\Lambda$-system, the coupling between $|1\\rangle$ and $|3\\rangle$ (the \"pump\" transition) is driven by a two-photon process via a far-detuned fourth level $|4\\rangle$ with energy $E_4 = \\hbar\\omega_{41}$.\n\nThe coupling scheme is as follows:\n- A \"pump 1\" laser with frequency $\\omega_{P1}$ and Rabi frequency $\\Omega_{P1}(t)$ drives the $|1\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |4\\rangle$ transition.\n- A \"pump 2\" laser with frequency $\\omega_{P2}$ and Rabi frequency $\\Omega_{P2}(t)$ drives the $|4\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |3\\rangle$ transition.\n- A \"Stokes\" laser with frequency $\\omega_S$ and Rabi frequency $\\Omega_S(t)$ drives the $|2\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |3\\rangle$ transition.\n\nThe fourth level $|4\\rangle$ is far-detuned from resonance with the \"pump 1\" laser, i.e., the detuning $\\Delta = \\omega_{P1} - \\omega_{41}$ is large. We assume two-photon resonance for the pump transition, $(\\omega_{P1} + \\omega_{P2}) - \\omega_{31} = 0$, and Raman resonance for the overall process, $(\\omega_{P1} + \\omega_{P2}) - \\omega_S = \\omega_{21} = 0$.\n\nUnder these conditions, the fourth level can be adiabatically eliminated, resulting in an effective three-level $\\Lambda$-system described by states $\\{|1\\rangle, |2\\rangle, |3\\rangle\\}$. This procedure yields an effective two-photon pump Rabi frequency $\\Omega_P^{\\text{eff}}(t)$ coupling states $|1\\rangle$ and $|3\\rangle$, but also introduces AC Stark shifts on states $|1\\rangle$ and $|3\\rangle$. The shift on state $|1\\rangle$, denoted by $\\hbar\\delta_{AC}(t)$, dynamically breaks the two-photon Raman resonance condition and would normally compromise the adiabatic transfer. To counteract this, an experimentalist introduces a time-dependent Raman detuning that exactly compensates for this shift, restoring the condition for a perfect dark state.\n\nThe system can then be analyzed as an ideal $\\Lambda$-system governed by the effective pump Rabi frequency $\\Omega_P^{\\text{eff}}(t)$ and the Stokes Rabi frequency $\\Omega_S(t)$.
