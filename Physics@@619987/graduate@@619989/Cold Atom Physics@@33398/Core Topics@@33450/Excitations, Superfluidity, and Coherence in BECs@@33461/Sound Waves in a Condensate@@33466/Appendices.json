The Bogoliubov modes are plane waves characterized by a wavevector $k$. The solution can be written as $\\psi(z) = \\begin{pmatrix} u(z) \\\\ v(z) \\end{pmatrix}$. Because the BdG equations are linear and the potential affects $u$ and $v$ identically, their spatial dependence will be the same. We can write $u(z) = u_k A(z)$ and $v(z) = v_k A(z)$, where $u_k$ and $v_k$ are the constant amplitudes for a free phonon and $A(z)$ is a spatial envelope function describing the scattering.
