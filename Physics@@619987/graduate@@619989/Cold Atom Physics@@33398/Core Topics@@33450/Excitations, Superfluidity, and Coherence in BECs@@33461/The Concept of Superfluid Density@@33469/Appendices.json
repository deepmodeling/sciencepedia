In a simple, uniform system in flat space, it is a scalar quantity. This first exercise explores a fascinating question: how does the geometry of the space itself affect this response? By confining a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate to the curved surface of a torus, we will discover that the superfluid density becomes anisotropic. This problem illustrates how the energy cost of a phase twist can depend on its direction, naturally leading to the idea of a superfluid density tensor and demonstrating that even a uniform condensate can exhibit a direction-dependent inertia dictated solely by the geometry of its container.
