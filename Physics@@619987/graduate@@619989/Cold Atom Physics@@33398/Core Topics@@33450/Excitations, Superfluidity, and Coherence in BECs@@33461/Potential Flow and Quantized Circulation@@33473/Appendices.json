We assume the obstacle is large compared to the healing length, i.e., $R \\gg \\xi$.\n\nAt low velocities, the superfluid flows irrotationally around the disk. The speed of the fluid is not uniform; it is zero at the stagnation points and reaches a maximum value, $v_{local, max}$, on the sides of the disk perpendicular to the flow direction.
