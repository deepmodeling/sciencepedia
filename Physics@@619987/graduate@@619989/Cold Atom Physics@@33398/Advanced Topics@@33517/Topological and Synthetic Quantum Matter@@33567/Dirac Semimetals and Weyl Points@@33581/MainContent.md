## Introduction
In the vast landscape of materials science, a new class of [quantum matter](@article_id:161610) has emerged that blurs the line between condensed matter and high-energy physics: [topological semimetals](@article_id:137306). Among these, Dirac and Weyl [semimetals](@article_id:151783) stand out as remarkable platforms where electrons behave not as conventional massive particles, but as massless relativistic entities described by equations once reserved for particle physics. This article addresses the fundamental questions of what these exotic states are, how they arise from more symmetric parent states, and what profound and often strange physical phenomena they harbor.

To guide our exploration, this article is structured into three main chapters. We will begin in **"Principles and Mechanisms"** by uncovering the fundamental theory, exploring how a fragile, highly symmetric Dirac point gives birth to a robust pair of Weyl points when fundamental symmetries are broken. Then, in **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** we will bridge theory and reality, examining the experimental signatures that prove the existence of these quasiparticles and the deep connections they forge with fields like cosmology and [hydrodynamics](@article_id:158377). Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section provides an opportunity to engage directly with the physics through guided problems that illuminate key concepts. Our journey begins with the fundamental building blocks of this new physics.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In our journey to understand these remarkable materials, we must start with the parent state from which they are born: the **Dirac semimetal**. Imagine a unique point in a crystal’s electronic structure, a sort of grand central station where four distinct [energy bands](@article_id:146082)—two belonging to electrons ready to conduct (conduction bands) and two to electrons locked in place (valence bands)—all meet at a single point in momentum space and energy. This four-way intersection is a **Dirac point**. It's a point of extreme degeneracy, a state of matter with a beautifully simple, linear energy dispersion in all directions, much like that of a massless relativistic particle described by the Dirac equation.

This remarkable state, however, is fragile. Its existence hinges on the crystal possessing certain fundamental symmetries, typically both **time-reversal symmetry (TRS)** and **inversion symmetry (IS)**. Time-reversal symmetry means the laws of physics governing the electrons don't change if you run the movie backwards. Inversion symmetry means the crystal looks the same when viewed from a point and its exact opposite. A Dirac point is like a perfectly balanced house of cards; these symmetries are the steady table it rests on. The fascinating physics begins when we start to gently shake that table.

### The Birth of Weyl Points: Breaking the Perfect Symmetry

What happens if we break one of these protective symmetries? The Dirac point, unable to sustain its four-fold degeneracy, splits. It doesn't just vanish; it cleaves into a pair of new, more robust entities called **Weyl points**. Each Weyl point is a simpler, two-fold degenerate crossing. Think of the Dirac point as a neutral particle that decays into a particle-antiparticle pair. These Weyl points are the fundamental building blocks of our story.

There are two primary ways to orchestrate this beautiful splitting.

First, we can break time-reversal symmetry. The most direct way to do this is to apply a magnetic field. A magnetic field has a direction, and it fundamentally distinguishes between "running the movie forwards" and "running it backwards." When a magnetic field is applied to a Dirac semimetal, it can introduce a **Zeeman energy** term that affects electron spins differently. This perturbation acts like a wedge, splitting the single Dirac point into two distinct Weyl points separated in [momentum space](@article_id:148442). Interestingly, if the material has an intrinsic "tilt" in its [band structure](@article_id:138885), this splitting not only separates the Weyl points in momentum but also in energy, placing one at a higher energy than the other [@problem_id:1239179].

Second, we can break inversion symmetry. This can happen in crystals that are naturally non-centrosymmetric—that is, their atomic lattice does not have a center of symmetry. The inherent asymmetry of the crystal potential acts as a permanent perturbation. This built-in [symmetry breaking](@article_id:142568) also forces the Dirac point to split into a pair of Weyl points. A simple model shows that an inversion-breaking term of strength $b$ will push two Weyl points apart in momentum space by a distance directly proportional to that strength, specifically by an amount $|\Delta\mathbf{k}| = \frac{2b}{v_F}$, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity [@problem_id:1239185].

So, by breaking either TRS or IS, a Dirac point gives birth to a pair of Weyl points. This isn't just a mathematical curiosity; it's a phase transition into a new state of matter: the **Weyl semimetal**.

### Cosmic Monopoles in a Crystal

These Weyl points are not just simple band crossings. They carry a profound [topological property](@article_id:141111): **chirality**, which is a sort of "handedness." Just as your left and right hands are mirror images but cannot be superimposed, a Weyl point can be either left-handed or right-handed. We assign a [topological charge](@article_id:141828), the **chirality** $\chi$, which is either $+1$ (say, right-handed) or $-1$ (left-handed).

When a Dirac point (with a net [chirality](@article_id:143611) of zero) splits, it always creates a pair of Weyl points with opposite chiralities: one $+1$ and one $-1$. The total chirality remains zero. This is a deep rule. You can't create a single Weyl point; they must come in pairs.

This is wonderfully analogous to the hypothetical magnetic monopoles in particle physics. While we've never seen a free north or south magnetic pole in nature—they always come in dipole pairs—Weyl points act as "monopoles" of **Berry curvature** in momentum space. The Berry curvature is a sort of fictitious magnetic field that exists in the abstract space of the electron's momentum. A Weyl point of [chirality](@article_id:143611) $+1$ acts as a source (a "north pole") from which these Berry curvature field lines emerge, while a Weyl point of [chirality](@article_id:143611) $-1$ acts as a sink (a "south pole") where they terminate.

This analogy is more than just a pretty picture. It means we can manipulate these topological charges. For instance, just as we can create Weyl points by breaking a symmetry, we can reverse the process. Imagine a Weyl semimetal where the Weyl points are separated because of a [broken symmetry](@article_id:158500). By applying an external parameter, such as [hydrostatic pressure](@article_id:141133), we might be able to tune the strength of that symmetry-breaking term. One can imagine a scenario where increasing pressure reduces the separation between the Weyl points. At a specific [critical pressure](@article_id:138339) $P_c$, the nodes meet and annihilate each other, releasing their topological charge and restoring the system to a "trivial" state, perhaps a Dirac semimetal or even a simple insulator [@problem_id:1239156]. This process is a **[topological phase transition](@article_id:136720)**, a fundamental change in the electronic character of the material, driven by the dance of these momentum-space monopoles.

### The Weird and Wonderful Consequences of Weyl Points

The existence of these monopoles inside a material leads to a host of bizarre and observable phenomena that have no counterpart in ordinary metals or semiconductors.

#### The Road to Nowhere: Fermi Arcs

Perhaps the most iconic signature of a Weyl semimetal is what happens at its surface. Because the bulk of the crystal is topologically "charged" with these monopoles, its boundary with the vacuum (or any normal insulator) must host special states to resolve this topological mismatch. These are the famous **Fermi arcs**.

In the surface's two-dimensional momentum space, one finds electronic states that form an open arc—a kind of highway for electrons that connects the projected location of a bulk Weyl point of one chirality to a partner of opposite [chirality](@article_id:143611). This is profoundly strange. In any normal 2D material, states at a constant energy must form closed loops. Here, the road just... ends. An electron traveling along this arc on the surface, upon reaching the end, seems to plunge into the abyss. Where does it go? It enters the three-dimensional bulk, now free to travel through the material via the Weyl cones themselves.

These surface states are not a mere mathematical abstraction. They are real, [localized states](@article_id:137386), whose wavefunctions decay exponentially as one moves from the surface into the bulk of the crystal. The characteristic **[penetration depth](@article_id:135984)**, $\xi$, tells us how tightly these states are bound to the surface. Calculations show this depth depends on the material parameters and the electron's momentum along the arc, confirming their identity as true surface phenomena [@problem_id:1239085] [@problem_id:1239120].

#### A Leak in the Universe: The Chiral Anomaly

Inside the bulk, the separation of electrons into left- and right-handed populations near the Weyl nodes has its own dramatic consequences. In normal circumstances, the number of left-handed electrons and right-handed electrons are separately conserved. You can't just turn one into the other.

However, Weyl semimetals exhibit a phenomenon known as the **[chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583)**, which was first predicted in the context of high-energy particle physics. If you apply an electric field ($\mathbf{E}$) and a magnetic field ($\mathbf{B}$) parallel to each other, you do the seemingly impossible: you break the conservation of chiral charge. This configuration "pumps" electrons from the states of one chirality to the states of the other. For instance, right-handed electrons might be continuously created while left-handed ones are destroyed, leading to a net generation of chiral charge.

The rate of this pumping is a universal quantity. Remarkably, for this process carried by the unique "zeroth Landau levels" that form in a magnetic field, the rate of chiral charge density generation is given by a beautiful and simple formula: $\frac{d\rho_5}{dt} = \frac{e^2}{2\pi^2\hbar^2} \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$. Notice what's *not* in this formula: no material-specific parameters like the Fermi velocity or effective mass. The rate depends only on the applied fields and fundamental constants of nature [@problem_id:1239155]. It’s a piece of fundamental quantum field theory happening right inside a solid crystal.

#### The Crystal's Inner Compass: Anomalous Hall Effect and Transport Signatures

The topological nature of Weyl points leaves fingerprints all over the material's [transport properties](@article_id:202636). One of the most direct is the **Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE)**. Normally, a Hall voltage (a voltage perpendicular to the current) is generated by an *external* magnetic field. In a Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry, an anomalous Hall voltage can appear even with zero external field.

The origin of this effect is the intrinsic Berry curvature—the momentum-space magnetic field we mentioned earlier. Electrons moving through the crystal are deflected by this internal field, just as they would be by an external one. The strength of this AHE is directly proportional to the separation of the Weyl points in [momentum space](@article_id:148442). The further apart the "+1" and "-1" monopoles are, the more "flux" of Berry curvature passes between them, and the larger the anomalous Hall conductivity becomes [@problem_id:1239201]. Measuring the AHE thus provides a direct electrical probe of the topological structure of the bands.

Furthermore, the unique properties of Weyl fermions lead to other distinct signatures. The linear energy dispersion $E \propto k$ of a simple Weyl cone results in a [density of states](@article_id:147400) that scales as $g(E) \propto E^2$, in sharp contrast to the $g(E) \propto \sqrt{E}$ behavior of conventional electrons [@problem_id:1239196]. More exotic variants, like hypothetical "double-Weyl" nodes with dispersion $E \propto k^2$, would have yet another distinct signature, with $g(E) \propto \sqrt{E}$ [@problem_id:1239092]. These fingerprints can be seen in experiments measuring [specific heat](@article_id:136429) or [quantum oscillations](@article_id:141861). Even subtle quantum interference effects are modified. An electron circling a Weyl point in momentum space acquires a **Berry phase** of $\pi$, a 180-degree twist in its quantum wavefunction. This phase leads to a phenomenon called **[weak antilocalization](@article_id:144455)**, a correction to the material's conductivity that can be precisely measured in a weak magnetic field and serves as another telltale sign of these topological quasiparticles [@problem_id:1239123].

From their symmetric origins to their topologically charged nature and the strange phenomena they produce, Weyl and Dirac points represent a profound linkage between the abstract beauty of topology, the exotic world of [high-energy physics](@article_id:180766), and the concrete, measurable properties of real materials.
