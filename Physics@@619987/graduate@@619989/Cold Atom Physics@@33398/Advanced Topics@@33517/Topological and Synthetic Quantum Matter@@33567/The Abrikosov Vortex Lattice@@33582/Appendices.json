For any configuration where a vortex is in the interior of the square, we can typically increase the distances (and thus the product $P$) by moving that vortex towards a boundary, away from the other vortices. This suggests that the energy minimum configuration will have all three vortices located on the boundary of the square. We will therefore test candidate configurations with vortices placed on the square's perimeter.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Candidate Configurations**\n\nDue to the symmetry of the square, we can anticipate that the ground-state configuration will also be symmetric. Let's analyze two plausible, high-symmetry configurations.\n\n**Candidate A: Isosceles Triangle with base on one side**\n\nLet's place two vortices on one side of the square and the third vortex on the opposing side, centered.

By symmetry, any choice of three corners is equivalent.\nLet the positions be:\n$\\mathbf{r}_1 = (-L/2, -L/2)$\n$\\mathbf{r}_2 = (L/2, -L/2)$\n$\\mathbf{r}_3 = (L/2, L/2)$\n\nLet's calculate the distances for this configuration:\n$d_{12} = \\sqrt{(L/2 - (-L/2))^2 + (-L/2 - (-L/2))^2} = \\sqrt{L^2 + 0} = L$\n$d_{23} = \\sqrt{(L/2 - L/2)^2 + (L/2 - (-L/2))^2} = \\sqrt{0 + L^2} = L$\n$d_{13} = \\sqrt{(L/2 - (-L/2))^2 + (L/2 - (-L/2))^2} = \\sqrt{L^2 + L^2} = \\sqrt{2L^2} = L\\sqrt{2}$\n\nThe product of distances for this configuration is:\n$$P_B = d_{12} d_{13} d_{23} = L \\cdot (L\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot L = \\sqrt{2} L^3$$\n\n4.  **Comparing Candidates and Determining the Ground State**\n\nTo find the configuration with the minimum energy, we must find the configuration with the maximum product of distances, $P$.\nWe compare $P_A$ and $P_B$:\n$P_A = \\frac{5}{4}L^3 = 1.25 L^3$\n$P_B = \\sqrt{2} L^3 \\approx 1.414 L^3$\n\nSince $\\sqrt{2} > 5/4$, we have $P_B > P_A$. The \"Three Corners\" configuration (Candidate B) has a larger product of distances, and therefore a lower total energy. It is the ground state for this simplified model.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Ratio of Distances**\n\nFor the ground-state configuration (three vortices at three corners of the square), the inter-vortex distances are $L$, $L$, and $L\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe shortest distance is $d_{\\text{short}} = L$.\nThe longest distance is $d_{\\text{long}} = L\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe ratio of the longest to the shortest distance is:\n$$\\frac{d_{\\text{long}}}{d_{\\text{short}}} = \\frac{L\\sqrt{2}}{L} = \\sqrt{2}$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$", "id": "1270731"}, {"introduction": "Scaling up from a few vortices to a macroscopic lattice introduces the concept of collective stability.
