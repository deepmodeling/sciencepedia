{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A cornerstone of modern cold atom experiments is the ability to precisely tune inter-particle interactions using a Feshbach resonance. This exercise provides a hands-on derivation of this tunability, starting from a microscopic two-channel model. By applying low-energy scattering theory, you will derive how the effective s-wave scattering length $a_s$, the key parameter governing the interaction strength in a BEC, depends on an externally controlled magnetic field detuning [@problem_id:1273376]. This practice is fundamental for bridging the gap between experimental control and theoretical models.", "problem": "A two-channel model for an s-wave Feshbach resonance considers the scattering of two atoms of mass $m$ in an open channel, which is coupled to a molecular bound state in a closed channel. The system is described by a field-theoretic Hamiltonian $H = H_{o} + H_{c} + H_{oc}$.\n\n1.  The open channel consists of atoms described by a field operator $\\psi$. The interaction within this channel gives rise to a background s-wave scattering length $a_{bg}$. The corresponding T-matrix for two-particle scattering in this channel alone is denoted $T_{bg}(E)$. In the low-energy limit $E \\to 0$, it is related to the background scattering length by $T_{bg}(0) = \\frac{4\\pi\\hbar^2 a_{bg}}{m}$.\n\n2.  The closed channel contains a single molecular state, described by a field operator $\\phi$, with a bare energy $\\delta$. This energy, called the detuning, can be controlled externally, for instance, by a magnetic field. The free propagator for this molecule at rest is $G_c(E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\delta}$.\n\n3.  The open and closed channels are coupled by an interaction term $H_{oc}$ with a constant coupling strength $g$, which allows two atoms to form a molecule and vice-versa.\n\nThe total T-matrix for two-atom scattering, $T(E)$, can be expressed in terms of the background T-matrix $T_{bg}(E)$ and the coupling to the closed channel. One can show that it satisfies the relation:\n$$\nT(E) = T_{bg}(E) + \\frac{g_{eff}(E)^2}{E - \\delta - \\Sigma(E)}\n$$\nwhere $g_{eff}(E)$ is an effective, energy-dependent coupling strength, and $\\Sigma(E)$ is the molecule self-energy due to the coupling to the open channel. For this problem, we will make a simplifying approximation standard for broad resonances by treating the effective coupling $g_{eff}$ as a constant, $g_{eff} \\approx g$, and neglecting the self-energy, $\\Sigma(E) \\approx 0$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the T-matrix for the full problem is given by:\n$$\nT(E) = T_{bg}(E) + \\frac{g^2}{E - \\delta}\n$$\nThis expression, however, is not quite complete. A proper derivation shows that the background scattering process itself dresses the coupling vertex. The correct expression for the total T-matrix, which accounts for the multiple-scattering processes in the open channel that precede the transition to the closed channel, is given by the exact relation:\n$$\nT(E) = T_{bg}(E) + (1 + T_{bg}(E) G_0(E)) \\frac{g^2}{E - \\delta_{ren}} (1 + G_0(E) T(E))\n$$\nwhere $G_0(E)$ is the free two-atom propagator in the open channel, and $\\delta_{ren}$ is the renormalized detuning. For low energies ($E \\to 0$), this Lippmann-Schwinger-type equation for the T-matrix becomes an algebraic equation. The free propagator contains a divergence that must be regularized. In low-energy scattering theory, this divergence is cancelled by expressing bare quantities in terms of physical observables. The operator relation $T_{bg} = V_{bg} + V_{bg}G_0 T_{bg}$ implies the identity $(1 + T_{bg}G_0) = (1 - V_{bg}G_0)^{-1}$, where $V_{bg}$ is the bare interaction potential in the open channel.\n\nUsing this formalism, derive the effective s-wave scattering length, $a_s$, as a function of the background scattering length $a_{bg}$, the detuning $\\delta$ (assumed to be the renormalized value), the coupling strength $g$, and the atomic mass $m$. To remove the explicit dependence on the bare potential $V_{bg}$ and the propagator $G_0$, you may use the approximation that the resonance is broad. A broad resonance corresponds to the physical limit where the characteristic range of the background potential is the smallest length scale in the problem, which can be formally taken by letting the bare potential strength $|V_{bg}| \\to \\infty$ while keeping $a_{bg}$ finite.\n\nFind the expression for $a_s$.", "solution": "1. The problem provides a simplified expression for the total T-matrix, stated as an approximation valid for broad resonances:\n$$T(E) = T_{bg}(E) + \\frac{g^2}{E - \\delta}$$\nWe will use this as our starting point.\n\n2. The effective s-wave scattering length, $a_s$, is defined by the value of the full T-matrix at zero energy, $T(0) = \\frac{4\\pi\\hbar^2 a_s}{m}$. Similarly, the background scattering length, $a_{bg}$, is related to the background T-matrix at zero energy by $T_{bg}(0) = \\frac{4\\pi\\hbar^2 a_{bg}}{m}$.\n\n3. We evaluate the simplified T-matrix equation at zero energy, $E=0$:\n$$T(0) = T_{bg}(0) + \\frac{g^2}{0 - \\delta} = T_{bg}(0) - \\frac{g^2}{\\delta}$$\n\n4.
