Consider a dilute, homogeneous gas of identical bosonic atoms, each with mass $m$. The gas is characterized by its number density $n$. At very low temperatures, particle losses from the gas are dominated by two main processes: two-body inelastic collisions and three-body recombination.\n\n1.  **Two-body inelastic loss**: Two atoms collide and are lost from the trap due to an inelastic process (e.g., spin-flip or chemical reaction). The rate of atom loss per unit volume from this process is given by $R_2 = K_2 n^2$. The rate coefficient $K_2$ is determined by the short-range physics of the interaction, which can be parameterized by a complex s-wave scattering length. For the purpose of this problem, we take the coefficient to be $K_2 = \\mathcal{C}_2 \\frac{\\hbar a_i}{m}$, where $a_i$ is the positive imaginary part of the scattering length, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $\\mathcal{C}_2$ is a given dimensionless constant of order unity.\n\n2.  **Three-body recombination**: Three atoms collide, leading to the formation of a diatomic molecule and a third atom that carries away the excess energy and momentum. All three initial atoms are typically lost from the trap. The rate of atom loss per unit volume from this process is given by $R_3 = L_3 n^3$. In the vicinity of a broad Feshbach resonance, the real part of the scattering length, $a$, becomes much larger than any other length scale in the system. In this so-called \"universal\" regime, the three-body recombination coefficient for bosons at zero temperature takes the form $L_3 = \\mathcal{C}_3 \\frac{\\hbar a^4}{m}$, where $\\mathcal{C}_3$ is a positive dimensionless constant that captures the complex\n    many-body physics.\n\nYour task is to find the critical atomic density $n_c$ at which the rate of atom loss per unit volume due to two-body inelastic collisions is exactly equal to the rate of atom loss from universal three-body recombination.

You will learn how to decompose a two-particle state into different total spin channels and weight their contributions, revealing how the internal structure of atoms governs their collective decay.", "problem": "Consider a dilute ultracold gas of spin-1 bosons of mass $m$, prepared entirely in the Zeeman sublevel $|F=1, m_F=0\\rangle$. At low energies, collisions are dominated by the s-wave ($l=0$) partial wave. For identical spin-1 bosons, the requirement of a symmetric total wavefunction under particle exchange allows s-wave scattering to proceed only through channels where the total spin of the colliding pair is $S=0$ or $S=2$. These two scattering channels are characterized by the scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$, respectively.\n\nDue to three-body recombination, the atomic density $n$ of the condensate decays according to the rate equation $\\dot{n} = -K_3 n^3$, where $K_3$ is the three-body loss coefficient. In the universal limit of large scattering lengths, the loss coefficient for a single channel with scattering length $a_S$ is given by $K_S = C_U \\frac{\\hbar a_S^4}{m}$, where $C_U$ is a dimensionless universal constant that we assume is the same for both channels.\n\nTo determine the total loss coefficient $K_3$ for the condensate, we adopt a simplified model. We assume the total loss rate is an incoherent sum of contributions from the allowed two-body s-wave scattering channels ($S=0$ and $S=2$). The contribution from each channel is weighted by the quantum mechanical probability that a pair of atoms, both initially in the $|m_F=0\\rangle$ state, will interact via that specific channel.\n\nYour task is to calculate the total three-body loss coefficient $K_3$ for this system in terms of the fundamental constants $\\hbar$ and $m$, the scattering lengths $a_0$ and $a_2$, and the universal constant $C_U$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the three-body loss coefficient $K_3$ for a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate in the $|F=1, m_F=0\\rangle$ state. The model provided states that $K_3$ is a weighted average of the loss coefficients for the pure scattering channels $S=0$ and $S=2$:\n$$K_3 = P_0 K_0 + P_2 K_2$$\nwhere $P_S$ is the probability that two colliding atoms from the condensate interact via the channel with total spin $S$, and $K_S$ is the loss coefficient for that channel, given by $K_S = C_U \\frac{\\hbar a_S^4}{m}$.\n\nOur first step is to determine the probabilities $P_0$ and $P_2$. These are found by decomposing the initial two-particle spin state into the basis of total spin states, $|S, M_S\\rangle$.\n\nThe initial state of two colliding atoms is $|F_1=1, m_{F1}=0\\rangle \\otimes |F_2=1, m_{F2}=0\\rangle$. We denote this state as $|1,0; 1,0\\rangle$. Since both atoms have $m_F=0$, the total magnetic quantum number is $M_S = m_{F1} + m_{F2} = 0$. Therefore, the two-particle state is a superposition of total spin states $|S, M_S=0\\rangle$. For spin-1 particles, the total spin can be $S=0, 1, 2$.\n\nWe use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to express the total spin eigenstates in terms of the individual particle states $|F_1, m_{F1}; F_2, m_{F2}\\rangle$:\n$$|S, M_S\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1, m_2} \\langle F_1, m_1; F_2, m_2 | S, M_S \\rangle |F_1, m_1; F_2, m_2 \\rangle$$\nFor our case, $F_1=F_2=1$ and $M_S=0$. The relevant states are:\n$$|S=2, M_S=0\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6}}|1,1; 1,-1\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}|1,0; 1,0\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6}}|1,-1; 1,1\\rangle$$\n$$|S=1, M_S=0\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}|1,1; 1,-1\\rangle - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}|1,-1; 1,1\\rangle$$\n$$|S=0, M_S=0\\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}|1,1; 1,-1\\rangle - \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}|1,0; 1,0\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}|1,-1; 1,1\\rangle$$\n\nWe need to express our initial state, $|1,0; 1,0\\rangle$, in this basis. By inspection of the coefficients of the $|1,0; 1,0\\rangle$ term in the expansions above, we can invert the relationship. The $|S=1, M_S=0\\rangle$ state does not contain a $|1,0; 1,0\\rangle$ component, so our initial state is a superposition of only the $|S=0\\rangle$ and $|S=2\\rangle$ states.\n$$|1,0; 1,0\\rangle = A|S=0, M_S=0\\rangle + B|S=2, M_S=0\\rangle$$\nThe coefficients $A$ and $B$ are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients $\\langle S, 0 | 1, 0; 1, 0 \\rangle$.\nFrom the expansions above:\n$$A = \\langle S=0, M_S=0 | 1,0; 1,0 \\rangle = -\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}$$\n$$B = \\langle S=2, M_S=0 | 1,0; 1,0 \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$$\nThus, the decomposition of the initial two-particle state is:\n$$|1,0; 1,0\\rangle = -\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}|S=0, M_S=0\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}|S=2, M_S=0\\rangle$$\n\nThe problem states that for identical bosons, s-wave scattering ($l=0$) is only allowed for symmetric spin states. For two identical spin-1 particles, the states with total spin $S=0$ and $S=2$ are symmetric, while $S=1$ is antisymmetric. Thus, both the $S=0$ and $S=2$ channels are accessible via s-wave collisions, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nThe probability of finding the colliding pair in a given total spin channel $S$ is the squared magnitude of the corresponding coefficient in the expansion.\nThe probability for the $S=0$ channel is:\n$$P_0 = \\left|-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}\\right|^2 = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nThe probability for the $S=2$ channel is:\n$$P_2 = \\left|\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}\\right|^2 = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nAs a check, the probabilities sum to unity: $P_0 + P_2 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{3} = 1$.\n\nNow we use the given model for the total loss coefficient:\n$$K_3 = P_0 K_0 + P_2 K_2$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_S$:\n$$K_3 = P_0 \\left(C_U \\frac{\\hbar a_0^4}{m}\\right) + P_2 \\left(C_U \\frac{\\hbar a_2^4}{m}\\right)$$\nPlugging in the calculated probabilities $P_0 = 1/3$ and $P_2 = 2/3$:\n$$K_3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\left(C_U \\frac{\\hbar a_0^4}{m}\\right) + \\frac{2}{3} \\left(C_U \\frac{\\hbar a_2^4}{m}\\right)$$\nFinally, we factor out the common terms to obtain the final expression:\n$$K_3 = \\frac{C_U \\hbar}{3m} (a_0^4 + 2a_2^4)$$\nThis expression gives the total three-body loss coefficient for the spin-1 BEC in the $|m_F=0\\rangle$ state, based on the provided incoherent mixing model.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{C_U \\hbar}{3m} (a_0^4 + 2a_2^4)} $$", "id": "1277465"}, {"introduction": "The theoretical predictions of enhanced three-body loss, such as those from Efimov physics, are directly verified in experiments by measuring atom loss as a function of magnetic field.
