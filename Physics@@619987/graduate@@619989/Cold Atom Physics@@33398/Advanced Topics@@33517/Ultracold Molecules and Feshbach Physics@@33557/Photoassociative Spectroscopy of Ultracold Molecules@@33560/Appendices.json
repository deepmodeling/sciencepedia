The rate of photoassociation is highly dependent on the scattering wavefunction of the two colliding atoms. For collisions with non-zero angular momentum, the effective interaction potential features a centrifugal barrier that can prevent the atoms from reaching the short internuclear distances where the photoassociation process is most efficient.\n\nConsider two identical bosonic atoms, each of mass $m$. The long-range interaction between them is described by the attractive van der Waals potential, $V_{\\text{vdW}}(r) = -C_6/r^6$, where $r$ is the internuclear separation and $C_6$ is the van der Waals coefficient. The atoms are prepared in such a way that they collide in a d-wave partial wave, corresponding to an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=2$.\n\nThe effective potential experienced by the colliding pair is the sum of the van der Waals potential and the centrifugal potential.
