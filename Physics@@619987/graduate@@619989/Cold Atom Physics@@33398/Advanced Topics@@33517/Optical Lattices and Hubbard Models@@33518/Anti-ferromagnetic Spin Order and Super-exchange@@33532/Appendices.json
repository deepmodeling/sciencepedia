The honeycomb lattice is a bipartite lattice, meaning it can be divided into two interpenetrating sublattices, A and B, such that any site on sublattice A has neighbors only on sublattice B, and vice versa. For the honeycomb lattice, the coordination number (the number of nearest neighbors for any site) is $z=3$.\n\nAt high temperatures, the system is in a paramagnetic phase with no long-range magnetic order. As the temperature is lowered, it undergoes a phase transition into an anti-ferromagnetic (Néel) phase, characterized by a non-zero staggered magnetization, where the average magnetization on sublattice A is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that on sublattice B. The temperature at which this transition occurs is called the Néel temperature, $T_N$.\n\nUsing molecular mean-field theory, determine the Néel temperature $T_N$ for this system. In this theory, the interaction of a given spin with its neighbors is replaced by the interaction with an effective \"molecular\" field, which is proportional to the average magnetization of those neighbors.
