The Fermi gas is characterized by a constant number density $n$. The interaction between the impurity and a gas particle is a short-range potential that can be fully described by its s-wave scattering length, $a$.\n\nThe Tan contact parameter, $C$, is a central quantity in the study of quantum gases with short-range interactions. It quantifies the probability of finding two interacting particles close to each other and governs a series of universal relations, known as the Tan relations. One such relation connects the energy of the system to the contact. For the case of a single impurity, its ground state energy $E_{imp}$ (also known as the polaron energy) is related to the total contact $C$ of the system via the adiabatic relation:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{imp}}{d(a^{-1})} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 C}{4\\pi m_r}\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $m_r = \\frac{m_I m_F}{m_I + m_F}$ is the reduced mass of the impurity-fermion pair.\n\nAssume the impurity is in its ground state of motion (zero momentum).

The interaction can be treated within the framework of first-order perturbation theory for this purpose.\n\nProvide an expression for the quantity $C/a^2$ in the limit $a \\to 0$. Your answer should be expressed in terms of the fermion density $n$ and fundamental constants.", "solution": "The problem asks for the Tan contact parameter $C$ to the lowest non-vanishing order in the s-wave scattering length $a$. We are given the adiabatic relation that connects the impurity energy $E_{imp}$ to the contact $C$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE_{imp}}{d(a^{-1})} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2 C}{4\\pi m_r}\n$$\nTo find $C$, we first need to determine the impurity's ground state energy $E_{imp}$ as a function of $a$. Since we are interested in the lowest non-vanishing order for $C$, we need to find the leading order dependence of $E_{imp}$ on $a$.\n\nThe interaction between the impurity and a fermion of the gas can be modeled by a contact potential, $V(\\mathbf{r}) = g \\delta(\\mathbf{r})$, where $g$ is the coupling constant. For low energies, this constant is related to the s-wave scattering length $a$ via the relation $g = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar^2 a}{m_r}$. This expression is the first term in an expansion and is sufficient for a lowest-order calculation.\n\nThe total Hamiltonian of the system is $H = H_0 + H_{int}$, where $H_0$ is the kinetic energy of the impurity and the Fermi sea, and $H_{int}$ is the interaction Hamiltonian. The impurity energy $E_{imp}$ is the interaction-induced energy shift of the ground state. To first order in the interaction strength $g$ (and thus in $a$), this energy shift is given by first-order perturbation theory:\n$$\nE_{imp} \\approx \\Delta E^{(1)} = \\langle \\Psi_0 | H_{int} | \\Psi_0 \\rangle\n$$\nHere, $|\\Psi_0\\rangle$ is the unperturbed ground state of the system.
