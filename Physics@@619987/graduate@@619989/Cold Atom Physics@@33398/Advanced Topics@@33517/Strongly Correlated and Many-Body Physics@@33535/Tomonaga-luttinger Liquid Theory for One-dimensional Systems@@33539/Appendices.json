It is a well-posed, scientifically sound question based on established principles of condensed matter physics. I will now proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n## DERIVATION AND OPTION ANALYSIS\n\nThis problem requires distinguishing between two different physical quantities: 1) the intrinsic conductance of a hypothetical, infinite, and homogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), and 2) the measured two-terminal DC conductance of a finite TLL wire connected to noninteracting Fermi Liquid (FL) leads.\n\n### 1. Intrinsic Conductance of a Homogeneous TLL\n\nThe intrinsic conductance of a TLL characterizes the current response to a potential gradient within a uniform system. This can be thought of as a TLL connected to hypothetical TLL leads with the same interaction parameter $K$. In this idealized scenario, electron-electron interactions, quantified by the Luttinger parameter $K$, renormalize the charge of the elementary current-carrying excitations. For a non-interacting system ($K=1$), the conductance of a single perfect channel is the quantum of conductance, $G_0 = e^2/h$. For an interacting TLL ($K \\neq 1$), the current response is modified. Using the Landauer-Büttiker formalism adapted for TLLs or the Kubo formula, it is a standard result that the intrinsic DC conductance of a clean, single-channel, spinless TLL is given by:\n\n$$\nG_{\\text{intrinsic}} = K \\frac{e^2}{h}\n$$\n\nFor repulsive interactions in a spinless fermion system, $K  1$, leading to a conductance suppression. For attractive interactions, $K  1$, leading to an enhancement.\n\n### 2. Two-Terminal Conductance with Noninteracting FL Leads\n\nThis scenario describes a realistic measurement setup. A finite TLL wire with parameter $K$ is connected between two reservoirs. The reservoirs are specified as non-interacting Fermi Liquids, which in the Luttinger liquid language means their interaction parameter is $K_{\\text{lead}} = 1$. A voltage bias $V$ is applied across these reservoirs. The conductance is $G = I/V$.\n\nThe crucial information is that the contacts are \"adiabatic\" and \"do not generate backscattering at low energies\". This corresponds to a smooth spatial variation of parameters between the leads and the wire. The problem further provides the key principle (Foundational Fact 4): \"the long-wavelength bosonic charge mode propagates across smooth spatial variations of $K(x)$ without reflection at zero frequency.\"\n\nThe DC measurement corresponds to the zero-frequency ($\\omega \\to 0$) limit. In this limit, the charge mode, which carries the current, transmits perfectly through the system, from the source lead, through the TLL wire, to the drain lead. The transmission probability for the charge-carrying mode is therefore unity, $T=1$.\n\nAccording to the Landauer formula, the two-terminal conductance of a one-dimensional channel is $G = T (e^2/h)$. Since the transmission is perfect ($T=1$), the conductance is:\n\n$$\nG_{\\text{2-terminal}} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h} = \\frac{e^2}{h}\n$$\n\nThis result is universal and independent of the interaction parameter $K$ of the wire. The interactions are still present within the wire, but their effect on the DC conductance is completely screened by the non-interacting leads. The physical picture is that the entire voltage drop occurs at the interfaces between the leads and the TLL wire, while the wire itself remains an equipotential region. The non-interacting leads dictate the injected current, and since there is no backscattering, this is the current that is measured.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a clean spinless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid wire connected to noninteracting Fermi Liquid leads via adiabatic contacts, the DC two-terminal conductance is $e^{2}/h$, independent of $K$, because the voltage drop occurs at the contacts and the bosonic charge mode is transmitted without reflection at zero frequency. By contrast, the intrinsic conductance of a homogeneous infinite Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (with Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid leads of the same $K$) is $K\\, e^{2}/h$.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement correctly identifies the two-terminal conductance as $G_{\\text{2-terminal}} = e^2/h$, independent of $K$, and provides the correct physical reasoning. It also correctly identifies the intrinsic TLL conductance as $G_{\\text{intrinsic}} = K e^2/h$. Both parts of the statement are consistent with our derivation.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The DC two-terminal conductance equals $K\\, e^{2}/h$ because electron-electron interactions renormalize the transmission probability of the entire device, while the intrinsic conductance of a homogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid is $e^{2}/(K h)$.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This statement incorrectly claims the two-terminal conductance is $K e^2/h$. It also incorrectly gives the intrinsic conductance as $e^2/(Kh)$; the factor $K$ should be in the numerator.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The DC two-terminal conductance equals $K^{2} e^{2}/h$ when attached to noninteracting leads since both contacts renormalize the response, and the intrinsic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid conductance equals $K\\, e^{2}/h$.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The expression for the two-terminal conductance, $K^2 e^2/h$, is incorrect. There is no physical basis for a $K^2$ dependence in this context. While the second part about intrinsic conductance is correct, the first part makes the entire statement invalid.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The DC two-terminal conductance depends on the wire length $L$ via $G \\propto K\\, e^{2}/(h\\, L)$ even at zero frequency due to finite-size effects, while the intrinsic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid conductance is $e^{2}/h$.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The claimed length dependence $G \\propto 1/L$ is characteristic of diffusive transport (Ohm's Law), not the ballistic transport described in this problem (clean wire, no backscattering). The DC conductance of a ballistic wire is independent of its length. Additionally, the statement that the intrinsic conductance is $e^2/h$ is only true for the non-interacting case ($K=1$) and is generally incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The DC two-terminal conductance equals $e^{2}/h$ only if $u$ in the wire equals the plasmon velocity in the leads; for $u$ mismatch one obtains $G=(e^{2}/h) \\cdot \\dfrac{2 u_{\\mathrm{lead}} u_{\\mathrm{wire}}}{u_{\\mathrm{lead}}^{2}+u_{\\mathrm{wire}}^{2}}$, while the intrinsic Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid conductance is $K\\, e^{2}/h$.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The assertion that the $e^2/h$ result depends on the equality of plasmon velocities is incorrect for adiabatic contacts and DC transport. As stated in the problem's foundational facts, there is no reflection at zero frequency even with varying parameters. The provided formula for velocity mismatch resembles an impedance matching formula for reflection at a sharp boundary at finite frequency, but it is not applicable to the DC conductance with adiabatic contacts. The claim about intrinsic conductance is correct, but the primary claim about the two-terminal conductance is flawed.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3021817"}]}
