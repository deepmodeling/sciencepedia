Mastering this calculation provides a solid foundation for understanding how all conservative traps function.", "problem": "An atom of mass $m$ is to be trapped and levitated against gravity using a single, focused, red-detuned laser beam. The beam propagates vertically upwards along the z-axis, with its focus at $z=0$. Gravity acts in the negative z-direction with acceleration $g$.\n\nThe interaction of the atom with the off-resonant light creates an optical dipole potential. For an atom confined near the beam axis ($r \\approx 0$), this potential can be described as a function of the vertical position $z$:\n$$U_{dip}(z) = -U_0 \\frac{1}{1 + (z/z_R)^2}$$\nwhere $U_0$ is the potential depth at the focus (a positive constant) and $z_R$ is the Rayleigh range of the Gaussian beam, which characterizes the length scale over which the beam remains focused.\n\nThe total potential experienced by the atom is the sum of the optical dipole potential and the gravitational potential, $U_{total}(z) = U_{dip}(z) + U_g(z)$.\n\nAssuming the optical trap is sufficiently strong or \"stiff,\" the atom's stable equilibrium position, $z_{eq}$, will be very close to the beam focus. This condition can be expressed mathematically as $|z_{eq}| \\ll z_R$.\n\nUnder this small displacement assumption, find a closed-form analytic expression for the stable equilibrium position $z_{eq}$ of the atom.", "solution": "The total potential energy of the atom along the z-axis is the sum of the optical dipole potential and the gravitational potential. The gravitational potential is given by $U_g(z) = mgz$.\n\nThus, the total potential is:\n$$U_{total}(z) = U_{dip}(z) + U_g(z) = -U_0 \\frac{1}{1 + (z/z_R)^2} + mgz$$\n\nAn equilibrium position $z_{eq}$ occurs where the net force on the atom is zero. The force is the negative gradient of the potential:\n$$F_{total}(z) = -\\frac{dU_{total}(z)}{dz}$$\n\nLet's compute the derivative of the total potential:\n$$\\frac{dU_{total}(z)}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left( -U_0 \\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{z}{z_R}\\right)^2\\right)^{-1} + mgz \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dU_{total}(z)}{dz} = -U_0 \\left( -1 \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{z^2}{z_R^2}\\right)^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{2z}{z_R^2} \\right) + mg$$\n$$\\frac{dU_{total}(z)}{dz} = \\frac{2U_0 z / z_R^2}{\\left(1 + (z/z_R)^2\\right)^2} + mg$$\n\nSetting the net force to zero, $F_{total}(z_{eq}) = -\\frac{dU_{total}}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=z_{eq}} = 0$, we get:\n$$-\\left( \\frac{2U_0 z_{eq} / z_R^2}{\\left(1 + (z_{eq}/z_R)^2\\right)^2} + mg \\right) = 0$$\n$$\\frac{2U_0 z_{eq} / z_R^2}{\\left(1 + (z_{eq}/z_R)^2\\right)^2} = -mg$$\n\nThis equation determines the exact equilibrium position(s) $z_{eq}$. We are asked to solve this under the assumption that the equilibrium position is very close to the focus, i.e., $|z_{eq}| \\ll z_R$. This implies that the dimensionless quantity $(z_{eq}/z_R)^2$ is much less than 1.\n\nWe can therefore use a Taylor approximation for the denominator:\n$$\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{z_{eq}}{z_R}\\right)^2\\right)^2 \\approx (1 + 0)^2 = 1$$\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the equilibrium equation gives a much simpler expression:\n$$\\frac{2U_0 z_{eq}}{z_R^2} \\approx -mg$$\n\nNow, we can solve for $z_{eq}$:\n$$z_{eq} \\approx -\\frac{mg z_R^2}{2U_0}$$\n\nThe negative sign indicates that the equilibrium position is below the focus ($z=0$), which is physically expected. The upward-pointing gradient force from the laser beam below the focus balances the downward force of gravity.\n\nTo confirm that this is a stable equilibrium, we check the sign of the second derivative of the potential at $z_{eq}$.
