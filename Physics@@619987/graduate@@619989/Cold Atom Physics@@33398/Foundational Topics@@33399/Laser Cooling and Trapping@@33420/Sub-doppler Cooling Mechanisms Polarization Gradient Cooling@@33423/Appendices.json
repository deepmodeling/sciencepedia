The atom-laser detuning $\\Delta$ is large and negative ($|\\Delta| \\gg \\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma$ is the excited state decay rate). In the low saturation limit, the atom spends most of its time in the ground state manifold. The interaction with the light field lifts the degeneracy of the ground state sublevels, creating two spatially varying potential energy surfaces (dressed states), which we label $|g_+\\rangle$ and $|g_-\\rangle$. Their corresponding potentials are given by:\n$$ U_+(z) = U_{avg} - U_{mod} \\sin(2kz) $$\n$$ U_-(z) = U_{avg} + U_{mod} \\sin(2kz) $$\nHere, $k$ is the laser wavevector. For negative detuning, the constants $U_{avg}$ and $U_{mod}$ are both negative. Optical pumping populates the ground state sublevels. An atom moving through the light field is continuously redistributed between the two potential surfaces.\n\nThe population dynamics of the state $|g_+\\rangle$, denoted by $\\Pi_+(z)$, can be modeled by a relaxation equation. For a moving atom, the population $\\Pi_+(z)$ relaxes towards the local steady-state population $\\Pi_+^{ss}(z)$ with a total optical pumping rate $\\Gamma_{p,tot}$, which you can assume is independent of position $z$. The rate equation is:\n$$ v\\frac{d\\Pi_+}{dz} = -\\Gamma_{p,tot} \\left( \\Pi_+(z) - \\Pi_+^{ss}(z) \\right) $$\nUnder optical pumping, the atom is preferentially pumped to the state with the highest potential energy (the most weakly coupled state). This results in a steady-state population for the $|g_+\\rangle$ state given by:\n$$ \\Pi_+^{ss}(z) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\eta \\sin(2kz)\\right) $$\nwhere $\\eta = U_{mod}/U_{avg}$ is the fractional modulation depth of the potentials, with $0 < \\eta \\le 1$.\n\nDue to its motion, the atom's internal state cannot instantaneously adapt to the changing light field. This results in a lag between the actual population $\\Pi_+(z)$ and the steady-state population $\\Pi_+^{ss}(z)$.

This incoherent process dissipates energy. However, if an atom moves with sufficient velocity $v$, it can undergo a coherent transition between the two diabatic potential curves as it passes through their crossing points. This is a Landau-Zener transition, which competes with and ultimately undermines the cooling mechanism.\n\nAssuming the atom moves with a constant velocity $v$, estimate the characteristic velocity $v_c$ for which the probability of a Landau-Zener transition at a crossing point is equal to $1/e$.
