An ideal linear frequency chirp, $\\omega_{L,ideal}(t)$, can maintain a constant deceleration, $a_{max}$, by keeping the laser frequency perfectly resonant with the changing Doppler shift of the atoms.\n\nIn a real experiment, such a chirp is often generated digitally, resulting in a staircase-like frequency ramp. The laser frequency is held constant at a value $\\omega_n$ for a short time interval $\\tau$, and then abruptly stepped to a new value for the next interval.\n\nConsider an atom of mass $m$ with a two-level optical transition at resonance frequency $\\omega_0$ and natural linewidth $\\Gamma$. It is being slowed by a counter-propagating laser beam with wavenumber $k$. The laser is intense, with a saturation parameter $s_0 = I/I_{sat} \\gg 1$, such that the on-resonance photon scattering rate is saturated at its maximum value, $\\Gamma_{scatt,max} = \\Gamma/2$. This provides a maximum possible deceleration, $a_{max}$.\n\nThe digital frequency synthesizer updates the laser frequency at the beginning of each time step of duration $\\tau$. The frequency for the $n$-th step is set to match the ideal linear chirp frequency evaluated at the temporal midpoint of that step. This strategy is employed to slow atoms from an initial velocity $v_i$ to a target final velocity $v_f$ over a total time $T$.\n\nDue to the discrete frequency steps, the laser is not perfectly resonant with the atom throughout each step. This leads to a reduced average slowing force and a final velocity slightly higher than the ideal target $v_f$.\n\nAssuming the detuning from resonance within any given step is small compared to the power-broadened linewidth $\\Gamma_b = \\Gamma\\sqrt{1+s_0}$, the deceleration can be approximated by $a(\\delta) \\approx a_{max} \\left( 1 - (2\\delta/\\Gamma_b)^2 \\right)$, where $\\delta$ is the instantaneous detuning.
