This exercise provides a foundational model for this process in a single-beam optical dipole trap, a workhorse of modern cold atom experiments. By applying standard scaling laws for trap properties, you will derive a crucial relationship linking the final laser power to a desired gain in phase-space density, offering a clear view of the engine behind this powerful cooling technique [@problem_id:1243840].", "problem": "An ultracold gas of $^{87}$Rb atoms is confined in a single-beam optical dipole trap (ODT), created by a focused laser with initial power $P_i$. The trap potential is well approximated as harmonic near its center. For such a trap, the trap depth $U_0$ is directly proportional to the laser power $P$, and the geometric mean of the trapping frequencies $\\bar{\\omega}$ scales as $\\bar{\\omega} \\propto \\sqrt{P}$.\n\nThe atomic cloud is initially characterized by the number of atoms $N_i$ and temperature $T_i$. To increase the phase-space density (PSD), a process of forced evaporative cooling is implemented by slowly reducing the laser power. This lowers the trap depth, allowing the most energetic atoms to escape. The remaining atoms thermalize to a new equilibrium with a lower number of atoms $N_f$ and a lower temperature $T_f$.\n\nThe peak phase-space density for a harmonically trapped gas is given by the expression $\\rho = N \\left( \\frac{\\hbar \\bar{\\omega}}{k_B T} \\right)^3$, where $N$ is the atom number, $T$ is the temperature, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe evaporative cooling process is modeled by two key assumptions:\n1. The process is \"self-similar,\" meaning the ratio of the trap depth to the thermal energy, $\\eta = U_0 / (k_B T)$, is kept constant throughout the evaporation ramp.\n2. The efficiency of the cooling process is described by a power-law relationship between the atom number and temperature:\n$$ \\frac{T}{T_i} = \\left(\\frac{N}{N_i}\\right)^\\alpha $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless constant characterizing the evaporation efficiency.\n\nIf the goal is to increase the peak phase-space density by a factor of $G$ (i.e., $\\rho_f / \\rho_i = G$), what must be the final laser power, $P_f$, in terms of the initial power $P_i$, the gain factor $G$, and the efficiency parameter $\\alpha$?", "solution": "The goal of the problem is to find the final laser power $P_f$ in terms of the initial power $P_i$, the phase-space density gain $G$, and the evaporation efficiency parameter $\\alpha$.\n\nFirst, we write the expression for the ratio of the final to initial phase-space density (PSD), which is given as $G$.\n$$ G = \\frac{\\rho_f}{\\rho_i} = \\frac{N_f \\left( \\frac{\\hbar \\bar{\\omega}_f}{k_B T_f} \\right)^3}{N_i \\left( \\frac{\\hbar \\bar{\\omega}_i}{k_B T_i} \\right)^3} $$\nHere, the subscripts 'i' and 'f' denote the initial and final states, respectively. The physical constants $\\hbar$ and $k_B$ cancel out.\n$$ G = \\frac{N_f}{N_i} \\left( \\frac{\\bar{\\omega}_f}{\\bar{\\omega}_i} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{T_i}{T_f} \\right)^3 $$\n\nNext, we use the scaling relations given in the problem statement to express the ratios of physical quantities in terms of each other.\nThe geometric mean trapping frequency scales with laser power as $\\bar{\\omega} \\propto \\sqrt{P}$. Therefore, the ratio of the final to initial frequencies is:\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{\\omega}_f}{\\bar{\\omega}_i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{P_f}{P_i}} $$\n\nThe evaporation process is performed such that $\\eta = U_0 / (k_B T)$ is constant. This implies $\\eta_f = \\eta_i$:\n$$ \\frac{U_{0,f}}{k_B T_f} = \\frac{U_{0,i}}{k_B T_i} $$\nRearranging this gives a relation between the temperature ratio and the trap depth ratio:\n$$ \\frac{T_f}{T_i} = \\frac{U_{0,f}}{U_{0,i}} $$\nSince the trap depth is proportional to the laser power, $U_0 \\propto P$, we have $U_{0,f}/U_{0,i} = P_f/P_i$. Thus, we find a direct relationship between the temperature ratio and the power ratio:\n$$ \\frac{T_f}{T_i} = \\frac{P_f}{P_i} $$\n\nNow, we can substitute these scaling relations into the expression for the PSD gain $G$:\n$$ G = \\frac{N_f}{N_i} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{P_f}{P_i}} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{T_i}{T_f} \\right)^3 = \\frac{N_f}{N_i} \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{T_f}{T_i}\\right)^{-3} $$\nUsing the relation $T_f/T_i = P_f/P_i$, we can eliminate the temperature ratio:\n$$ G = \\frac{N_f}{N_i} \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{-3} = \\frac{N_f}{N_i} \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{-3/2} $$\n\nThis equation relates the PSD gain $G$ to two ratios: $N_f/N_i$ and $P_f/P_i$. We need to eliminate the atom number ratio. For this, we use the second assumption about the evaporation process, the efficiency relation:\n$$ \\frac{T_f}{T_i} = \\left(\\frac{N_f}{N_i}\\right)^\\alpha $$\nSince we already found $T_f/T_i = P_f/P_i$, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{P_f}{P_i} = \\left(\\frac{N_f}{N_i}\\right)^\\alpha $$\nSolving for the atom number ratio gives:\n$$ \\frac{N_f}{N_i} = \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{1/\\alpha} $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $N_f/N_i$ back into our equation for $G$:\n$$ G = \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{1/\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{-3/2} $$\nCombining the exponents, we get:\n$$ G = \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha} - \\frac{3}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{P_f}{P_i}\\right)^{\\frac{2 - 3\\alpha}{2\\alpha}} $$\n\nOur goal is to find the final power $P_f$. We can solve for the ratio $P_f/P_i$ by raising both sides to the power of $\\frac{2\\alpha}{2 - 3\\alpha}$:\n$$ \\frac{P_f}{P_i} = G^{\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha}{2 - 3\\alpha}\\right)} $$\nFinally, we can write the expression for the final power $P_f$:\n$$ P_f = P_i \\cdot G^{\\left(\\frac{2\\alpha}{2 - 3\\alpha}\\right)} $$\nThis can also be written with a negative sign in the exponent to make the denominator positive, which is often preferred when $\\alpha > 2/3$ (a condition for efficient evaporation, which makes the exponent negative).\n$$ P_f = P_i \\cdot G^{\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha}{3\\alpha - 2}\\right)} $$\nBoth forms are equivalent.
