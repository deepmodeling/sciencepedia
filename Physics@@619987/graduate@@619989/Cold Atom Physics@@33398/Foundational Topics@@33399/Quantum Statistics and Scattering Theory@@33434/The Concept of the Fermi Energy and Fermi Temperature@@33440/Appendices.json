The two species are confined within the same three-dimensional volume $V$. The mass of a particle of species A is twice the mass of a particle of species B, i.e., $m_A = 2m_B$.\n\nThe Fermi energy $E_F$ for a gas of $N$ non-interacting, spin-polarized fermions of mass $m$ in a volume $V$ is given by the expression:\n$$E_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left(6\\pi^2 \\frac{N}{V}\\right)^{2/3}$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nIf the two fermionic species in the mixture are in thermodynamic equilibrium such that their chemical potentials are equal, which at $T=0$ means their Fermi energies are equal ($E_{F,A} = E_{F,B}$), what is the value of the ratio of their particle numbers, $N_A/N_B$?", "solution": "The problem asks for the ratio of particle numbers $N_A/N_B$ for a two-component Fermi gas under the conditions of equal Fermi energies and a specified mass ratio.\n\nThe Fermi energy for a non-interacting, spin-polarized 3D Fermi gas is given as:\n$$E_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left(6\\pi^2 \\frac{N}{V}\\right)^{2/3}$$\n\nWe can write this expression for each species, A and B.
