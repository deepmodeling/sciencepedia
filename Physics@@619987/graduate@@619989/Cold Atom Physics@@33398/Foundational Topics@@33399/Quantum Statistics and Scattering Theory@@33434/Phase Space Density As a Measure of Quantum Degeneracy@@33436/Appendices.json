Subsequently, an idealized process polarizes the entire atomic sample into a single, specified magnetic sublevel. This optical pumping process is assumed to occur at constant total atom number $N$, constant temperature $T$, and constant trap frequency $\\omega$.\n\nSince atoms in different internal spin states are distinguishable, the onset of quantum degeneracy must be evaluated for each spin component individually.
