For the equation $k_1 \\cot(k_1 a) = k \\cot(ka)$ to hold, $\\cot(k_1a)$ must also be singular, which means $k_1a=m\\pi$.\n    A more careful way is to rewrite the equation as $\\frac{1}{k}\\tan(ka) = \\frac{1}{k_1}\\tan(k_1a)$.\n    If $ka=n\\pi$ and $k_1a=m\\pi$, then $\\tan(ka)=0$ and $\\tan(k_1a)=0$.

So, these conditions indeed specify a set of Ramsauer-Townsend minima.\n    Since $k_1 > k$, we must have $m > n$.\n\n6.  **Relating Wave Numbers to Potential Depth**\n    From the definitions of $k$ and $k_1$:\n    $$\n    k_1^2 = k^2 + \\frac{2mV_0}{\\hbar^2}\n    $$\n    Multiplying by $a^2$:\n    $$\n    (k_1 a)^2 = (ka)^2 + \\frac{2mV_0 a^2}{\\hbar^2}\n    $$\n    Substituting $ka=n\\pi$, $k_1a=m\\pi$, and the given potential strength $U_0 = \\frac{2mV_0 a^2}{\\hbar^2} = 15\\pi^2$:\n    $$\n    (m\\pi)^2 = (n\\pi)^2 + 15\\pi^2\n    $$\n    Dividing by $\\pi^2$, we get a Diophantine equation for the integers $m$ and $n$:\n    $$\n    m^2 = n^2 + 15 \\implies m^2 - n^2 = 15\n    $$\n\n7.  **Solving for Integer Pairs $(n, m)$**\n    We factor the difference of squares:\n    $$\n    (m-n)(m+n) = 15\n    $$\n    Since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $m>n$, the terms $(m-n)$ and $(m+n)$ must be positive integer factors of 15. Let $A = m-n$ and $B = m+n$. We must have $B > A > 0$.\n    The integer factor pairs of 15 are (1, 15) and (3, 5).\n\n    Case 1: $m-n=1$ and $m+n=15$.\n    Adding the two equations gives $2m = 16 \\implies m = 8$.\n    Subtracting the first from the second gives $2n = 14 \\implies n = 7$.\n    This gives the valid integer pair $(n,m) = (7,8)$.\n\n    Case 2: $m-n=3$ and $m+n=5$.\n    Adding the two equations gives $2m = 8 \\implies m = 4$.\n    Subtracting the first from the second gives $2n = 2 \\implies n = 1$.\n    This gives the valid integer pair $(n,m) = (1,4)$.\n\n8.  **Determining the Lowest Energy**\n    The energy of the scattered particle is related to the wave number $k$ by $E = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$.\n    Using the condition $ka = n\\pi$, we find $k = n\\pi/a$.\n    So, the energy levels corresponding to these special minima are given by:\n    $$\n    E_n = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2}\n    $$\n    We found two possible values for $n$: $n=7$ and $n=1$. The problem asks for the *lowest-energy* minimum. Since energy is proportional to $n^2$, the lowest energy corresponds to the smallest possible value of $n$.\n    The smallest value is $n=1$.\n\n9.  **Final Calculation**\n    Substituting $n=1$ into the energy expression gives the lowest energy:\n    $$\n    E_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{(1)^2 \\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2}\n    $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2ma^2}} $$", "id": "1275301"}, {"introduction": "Scattering theory reveals deep connections between a potential's properties and the behavior of particles interacting with it.
