The interaction potential depends on the electronic state of the quasi-molecule formed during the collision. We focus on a simplified two-state model, with diabatic electronic states $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$. The corresponding potential energy curves are $V_1(R)$ and $V_2(R)$, where $R$ is the internuclear separation. These diabatic potentials are coupled by an off-diagonal matrix element $V_{12}$.\n\nIn the vicinity of an internuclear distance $R_c$ where the diabatic potentials cross, i.e., $V_1(R_c) = V_2(R_c)$, the potentials can be approximated as linear functions of $R$:\n$$ V_1(R) \\approx E_c - F_1(R - R_c) $$\n$$ V_2(R) \\approx E_c - F_2(R - R_c) $$\nHere, $E_c$ is the energy at the crossing point, and $F_1$ and $F_2$ represent the forces (slopes) of the respective diabatic potential curves. The coupling $V_{12}$ is assumed to be constant in this region. This coupling leads to a splitting of the energy levels, resulting in two adiabatic potential curves that exhibit an avoided crossing.\n\nA collision event is considered where the system approaches the crossing region, passes through it, reflects at a classical turning point, and then passes through the crossing region again on its way out. The system is initially prepared in state $|1\\rangle$ at very large separation.\n\nThe probability of making a non-adiabatic transition (i.e., staying on the initial diabatic curve) during a single passage through the crossing region is given by the Landau-Zener formula, $P_{LZ} = \\exp(-\\Gamma)$, where the Landau-Zener parameter $\\Gamma$ is given by\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{2\\pi V_{12}^2}{\\hbar v |\\Delta F|} $$\nwith $\\Delta F = F_1 - F_2$ and $v$ being the relative radial velocity of the colliding partners at the crossing point $R_c$.\n\nThe total probability for the system to end up in state $|2\\rangle$ after the collision (after two passages through the crossing) is given by the Landau-Zener-Stückelberg formula, which accounts for the interference between the two non-adiabatic transition events:\n$$ P_{1 \\to 2} = 4 P_{LZ} (1 - P_{LZ}) \\sin^2(\\phi_{St}) $$\nThe phase $\\phi_{St}$ is the semi-classical phase (the \"Stückelberg phase\") accumulated between the two passages due to the energy difference between the two adiabatic paths.\n\n**Problem:**\nFor a specific collision process described by the model above, the Landau-Zener parameter is determined to be $\\Gamma = \\ln(4)$.
