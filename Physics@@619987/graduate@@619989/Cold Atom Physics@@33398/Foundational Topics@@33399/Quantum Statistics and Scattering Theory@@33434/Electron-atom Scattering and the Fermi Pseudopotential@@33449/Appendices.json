This interaction can often be modeled by an effective zero-range potential, known as the Fermi pseudopotential, whose strength is determined by a single parameter: the s-wave scattering length, $a_s$. To determine $a_s$ for a realistic interaction potential, one must solve the low-energy scattering problem.\n\nConsider a particle of mass $m$ scattering off a static, spherically symmetric potential given by an attractive delta-shell:\n$$ V(r) = -V_0 \\delta(r-R) $$\nwhere $V_0$ and $R$ are positive constants. The s-wave scattering length, $a_s$, is defined from the behavior of the $l=0$ radial wave function, $u(r) = r\\psi(r)$, in the zero-energy limit ($E \\to 0$). Specifically, for distances beyond the range of the potential ($r > R$), the wave function has the form $u(r) \\propto (r - a_s)$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the s-wave scattering length $a_s$ for this potential.

The TISE simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u_<(r)}{dr^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution is $u_<(r) = Ar + B$. The physical wave function must be regular at the origin, which implies that the radial wave function $\\psi(r) = u(r)/r$ is finite at $r=0$. This requires $u(0)=0$, so we must have $B=0$. Thus, the solution in the inner region is:\n$$ u_<(r) = Ar $$\n\n**Region 2: $r > R$**\nIn this region, $V(r)=0$ as well. The TISE is again:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u_>(r)}{dr^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution is $u_>(r) = Cr + D$.\nThis solution must match the asymptotic form defining the scattering length, $u(r) \\propto (r-a_s)$. By comparing the two forms, we can identify $C$ as the proportionality constant and $D = -C a_s$. So, the solution in the outer region is:\n$$ u_>(r) = C(r-a_s) $$\n\n**Boundary Conditions at $r=R$**\nWe must apply two boundary conditions at $r=R$:\n1.
