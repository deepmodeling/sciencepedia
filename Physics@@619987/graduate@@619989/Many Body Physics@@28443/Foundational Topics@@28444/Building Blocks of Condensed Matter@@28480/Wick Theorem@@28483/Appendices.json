This gives a total of 8 internal legs.\n2.  **Connectivity Condition 1:** No external-external propagators, i.e., no contractions of the form $\\overbracket{\\phi(x_i)\\phi(x_j)}$. This means that all 6 external fields must be contracted with fields at the vertices $z_1$ or $z_2$. This uses 6 of the 8 available vertex legs.\n3.  **Remaining Legs:** After connecting the 6 external fields, $8 - 6 = 2$ vertex legs remain to be contracted.\n4.  **Connectivity Condition 2:** The subgraph of vertices must be connected. This means there must be at least one propagator connecting a field at $z_1$ to a field at $z_2$.\n    *   Let the two remaining vertex legs be $L_A$ and $L_B$. They must be contracted with each other.\n    *   If both $L_A$ and $L_B$ belong to the same vertex (e.g., $z_1$), the contraction forms a self-loop on that vertex. In this case, there would be no propagator connecting $z_1$ and $z_2$, violating the second connectivity condition.\n    *   Therefore, for the vertex subgraph to be connected, one of the remaining legs must belong to the vertex at $z_1$ and the other to the vertex at $z_2$. Their contraction forms a single propagator $\\overbracket{\\phi(z_1)\\phi(z_2)}$.\n\nThis structural analysis fixes the topology of any fully connected diagram for this process:\n*   There is exactly one propagator connecting the two vertices $z_1$ and $z_2$.\n*   Since one leg from each vertex is used for the internal propagator, each vertex has $4-1=3$ legs remaining.\n*   These $3+3=6$ remaining legs must be connected to the 6 external fields.\n\nNow we can count the number of distinct contractions that produce this topology. We can break this down into two independent steps:\n\n**Step 1: Form the internal propagator connecting the vertices.**\nWe need to choose one field from the four at vertex $z_1$ and one field from the four at vertex $z_2$ and contract them.\n*   Number of choices for the field at $z_1$: 4.\n*   Number of choices for the field at $z_2$: 4.\n*   Total number of ways to form the internal propagator: $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the external fields to the remaining vertex legs.**\nAfter Step 1, we are left with 3 legs at vertex $z_1$ and 3 legs at vertex $z_2$. We also have the 6 external fields $\\phi(x_1), \\dots, \\phi(x_6)$. We must contract these 6 external fields with the 6 remaining vertex legs. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to form a perfect matching between the set of 6 external fields and the set of 6 remaining vertex legs.\n*   The number of ways to pair 6 distinct objects with another 6 distinct objects is the number of permutations of 6 elements, which is $6!$.\n*   $6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 720$.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\nThe total number of distinct Wick contractions for fully connected diagrams is the product of the number of ways to perform each step.\n*   Total number = (Ways to form internal propagator) $\\times$ (Ways to connect external fields)\n*   Total number = $16 \\times 6! = 16 \\times 720$.\n\nCalculation:\n$16 \\times 720 = 16 \\times (700 + 20) = 16 \\times 700 + 16 \\times 20 = 11200 + 320 = 11520$.\n\nAlternatively, $16 \\times 720 = 10 \\times 720 + 6 \\times 720 = 7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nThus, there are 11520 distinct ways to form the Wick contractions that lead to fully connected diagrams for the six-point function at second order in $\\lambda\\phi^4$ theory.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11520}$$", "id": "1220836"}]}
