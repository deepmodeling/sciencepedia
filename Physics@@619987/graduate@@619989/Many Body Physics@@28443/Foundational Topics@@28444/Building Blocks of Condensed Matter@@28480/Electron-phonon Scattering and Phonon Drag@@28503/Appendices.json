(Answer 1 for true, 0 for false.)", "solution": "In a 3D isotropic metal, the DC resistivity arises from scattering processes that dissipate the net momentum of the electron system. Consider the following:\n\n1. **Momentum conservation in scattering**:\n   - Normal (N) electron-phonon scattering processes conserve the total crystal momentum of the system. The momentum transfer satisfies $\\mathbf{k}' = \\mathbf{k} \\pm \\mathbf{q}$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ and $\\mathbf{k}'$ are electron wavevectors, $\\mathbf{q}$ is the phonon wavevector, and no reciprocal lattice vector $\\mathbf{G} \\neq 0$ is involved.\n   - This implies that the total momentum of the electron-phonon system is unchanged: $\\Delta \\mathbf{P}_{\\text{total}} = 0$.\n\n2. **Effect on electrical current**:\n   - Under an applied electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, electrons gain a net drift momentum $\\langle \\mathbf{P} \\rangle$.\n   - In the absence of Umklapp processes, only N-processes occur. These redistribute momentum among electrons and phonons but conserve $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{total}}$. Thus, the net momentum $\\langle \\mathbf{P} \\rangle$ of the electron system is not transferred to the lattice.\n\n3. **Consequence for resistivity**:\n   - A finite DC resistivity requires a mechanism to relax the net momentum of the electron system to zero (i.e., dissipation to the lattice).\n   - Since N-processes conserve $\\mathbf{P}_{\\text{total}}$, they cannot reduce $\\langle \\mathbf{P} \\rangle$ to zero. Instead, they establish a displaced Fermi distribution, maintaining a finite current without dissipation.\n   - Mathematically, the collision integral for N-processes alone yields a steady state with $\\partial f / \\partial t \\big|_{\\text{coll}} = 0$ for a shifted Fermi-Dirac distribution $f(\\mathbf{k}) = f_0(\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{q}_d)$, where $\\mathbf{q}_d$ is proportional to $\\mathbf{E}$.\n\n4. **Role of Umklapp processes**:\n   - Umklapp (U) processes involve $\\mathbf{G} \\neq 0$, so $\\mathbf{k}' = \\mathbf{k} \\pm \\mathbf{q} + \\mathbf{G}$.\n   - This violates conservation of crystal momentum, allowing momentum transfer to the lattice, which dissipates $\\langle \\mathbf{P} \\rangle$ and produces finite resistivity.\n\nTherefore, electron-phonon Normal scattering alone cannot produce finite DC resistivity, as it conserves total momentum and lacks a dissipation mechanism for the net electron momentum.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "1131493"}, {"introduction": "Having established the importance of momentum-dissipating scattering, we now turn to its quantitative consequences for resistivity.

The Seebeck coefficient, $S$, is defined as the ratio of the induced electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ to the temperature gradient $\\nabla T$ under open-circuit conditions ($\\mathbf{j}=0$), i.e., $\\mathbf{E} = -S \\nabla T$. In metals, $S$ is typically composed of two main contributions: a direct, or diffusion, term ($S_d$) arising from the tendency of electrons to diffuse from the hot end to the cold end, and a phonon drag term ($S_g$).\n\nThe phonon drag effect arises because a temperature gradient induces a net flow of phonons from hot to cold. These phonons carry momentum and can transfer it to the conduction electrons via electron-phonon scattering. This \"drag\" acts as an effective force on the electrons, pushing them along the direction of heat flow and thus generating an additional thermoelectric field.\n\nConsider a simple three-dimensional metal with atomic valence $Z$.

In steady state under a temperature gradient $\\nabla T$ and open-circuit conditions, the electric force on a conduction electron (charge $-e$) balances the average drag force exerted on it by the non-equilibrium phonon system, $\\mathbf{F}_{drag}$.\n2.  The drag force per electron is related to the net rate of momentum transfer per unit volume from phonons to electrons. This rate is given by the phonon momentum density, $\\mathbf{P}_{ph}$, divided by the relaxation time for phonons scattering off electrons, $\\tau_{ph-e}$.\n3.  The phonon momentum density $\\mathbf{P}_{ph}$ is related to the phonon heat current density $\\mathbf{j}_{Q,ph}$ by $\\mathbf{j}_{Q,ph} = v_s^2 \\mathbf{P}_{ph}$, where $v_s$ is the average speed of sound in the metal.\n4.
