Semiclassical electron orbits in reciprocal space, corresponding to different bands or different sheets of the Fermi surface, can become coupled when they approach each other closely. At these \"breakdown junctions,\" an electron has a non-zero probability of tunneling from one orbit to another.\n\nConsider a simple network of electron paths in a metal, as depicted in k-space. An electron is initially traveling along an open orbit (path 1). This orbit is coupled to a closed-loop path segment (path 2) at two sequential magnetic breakdown junctions, labeled A and B.
