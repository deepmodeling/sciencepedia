When a constant electric field is applied to a crystal, an electron does not accelerate indefinitely but instead oscillates in both momentum and real space. This practice explores the fundamental nature of these oscillations by calculating their period. You will discover the remarkable result that the oscillation period is a universal quantity, independent of the material-specific details of the energy band, such as hopping parameters. This exercise [@problem_id:1128421] thus provides deep insight into the consequences of the periodic nature of the Brillouin zone.", "problem": "An electron is in a one-dimensional crystal lattice with lattice constant $a$. The energy dispersion relation of the electron is described by a tight-binding model that includes both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor hopping. The energy of the electron as a function of its crystal momentum $k$ is given by:\n$$\n\\epsilon(k) = -2t_1 \\cos(ka) - 2t_2 \\cos(2ka)\n$$\nwhere $t_1$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping integral and $t_2$ is the next-nearest-neighbor hopping integral.\n\nA uniform, static electric field $E$ is applied along the direction of the chain. According to the semiclassical model of electron dynamics, the electron will undergo periodic motion in both momentum space and real space, a phenomenon known as Bloch oscillations.\n\nCalculate the period $T_B$ of these Bloch oscillations. Express your answer in terms of the applied electric field $E$, the lattice constant $a$, the elementary charge $e$, and the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the period of Bloch oscillations for an electron in a 1D crystal under a uniform electric field $E$. The key to solving this is the semiclassical equation of motion for the electron's crystal momentum $k$.\n\n1.  **Semiclassical Equation of Motion:**\n    In the presence of an external electric field $E$, the force on the electron is $F_{ext} = -eE$. The semiclassical equation of motion relates this external force to the rate of change of the crystal momentum $\\hbar k$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(\\hbar k)}{dt} = F_{ext}\n    $$\n    Substituting the force, we get:\n    $$\n    \\hbar \\frac{dk}{dt} = -eE\n    $$\n    This equation describes how the electron's crystal momentum evolves in time. Note that this equation is independent of the specific form of the energy dispersion $\\epsilon(k)$. The parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$ from the dispersion relation are therefore not relevant for calculating the time evolution of $k$.\n\n2.  **Integrating the Equation of Motion:**\n    Since the electric field $E$ is uniform and static, we can directly integrate the equation of motion with respect to time $t$:\n    $$\n    \\int_{k(0)}^{k(t)} dk' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{eE}{\\hbar} dt'\n    $$\n    This yields:\n    $$\n    k(t) - k(0) = -\\frac{eE}{\\hbar} t\n    $$\n    or\n    $$\n    k(t) = k(0) - \\frac{eE}{\\hbar} t\n    $$\n    This shows that the crystal momentum $k$ changes linearly with time.\n\n3.  **Periodicity in the Brillouin Zone:**\n    The energy dispersion $\\epsilon(k)$, and all other physical properties of the electron, are periodic in the reciprocal lattice. For a 1D lattice with lattice constant $a$, the reciprocal lattice vector has magnitude $2\\pi/a$. This means that crystal momenta $k$ and $k + n(2\\pi/a)$ (where $n$ is an integer) are physically equivalent. The first Brillouin zone (BZ) is a primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice, typically chosen as the interval $[-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$, which has a width of $\\Delta k_{BZ} = 2\\pi/a$.\n\n4.  **Definition of Bloch Oscillation Period:**\n    A Bloch oscillation is completed when the electron's crystal momentum $k(t)$ has swept across the entire Brillouin zone and returned to a point equivalent to its starting point. The period of this oscillation, $T_B$, is the time it takes for the crystal momentum to change by a reciprocal lattice vector, i.e., $|\\Delta k| = |k(T_B) - k(0)| = 2\\pi/a$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period:**\n    Using the integrated equation of motion for the change in momentum over one period $T_B$:\n    $$\n    |k(T_B) - k(0)| = \\left| -\\frac{eE}{\\hbar} T_B \\right|\n    $$\n    We set this change equal to the width of the Brillouin zone:\n    $$\n    \\frac{eE}{\\hbar} T_B = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n    $$\n    Solving for the Bloch period $T_B$, we find:\n    $$\n    T_B = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{eEa}\n    $$\n    The hopping parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$ determine the shape of the energy band and thus affect the amplitude and waveform of the electron's real-space oscillation, but they do not influence the period of the oscillation, which is solely determined by the fundamental lattice spacing and the applied field.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{eEa}}\n$$", "id": "1128421"}, {"introduction": "While Bloch oscillations describe an ideal, coherent dynamic, transport in real materials is dominated by scattering processes that disrupt this coherence.
