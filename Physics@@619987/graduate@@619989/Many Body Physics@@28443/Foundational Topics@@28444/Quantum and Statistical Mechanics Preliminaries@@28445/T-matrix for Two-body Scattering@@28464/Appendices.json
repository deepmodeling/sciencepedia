The analytic structure of the T-matrix in the complex energy plane reveals crucial information about the underlying potential. Poles of the T-matrix correspond to specific physical phenomena:\n-   Poles on the negative real energy axis ($E < 0$) on the first Riemann sheet correspond to **bound states**. These are normalizable, stationary states with discrete energy levels.\n-   Poles on the second Riemann sheet can correspond to **resonances** (if $E$ has a non-zero imaginary part) or **virtual states**. A virtual state is a pole on the negative real energy axis of the second Riemann sheet. It represents a system that is \"almost bound\" and is characterized by a very large s-wave scattering length, but it is not a normalizable state.\n\nThe condition for the existence of poles in the s-wave ($l=0$) channel can be derived by analyzing the solutions of the radial Schrödinger equation with purely outgoing boundary conditions.
