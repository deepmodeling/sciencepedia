It presents a standard model in statistical mechanics, for which a unique and meaningful solution exists. We will proceed with the derivation as requested.\n\nThe system consists of $N$ non-interacting, identical spins. Therefore, the properties of the full system can be derived from the properties of a single spin.\n\nFirst, we derive the single-spin partition function, denoted by $z(\\beta)$. A single spin has two possible energy states: $E_{\\uparrow}=-\\mu B$ and $E_{\\downarrow}=+\\mu B$. The degeneracy of each state is $1$. By definition, the partition function is the sum over all states of the Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-\\beta E_{i})$.\n$$\nz(\\beta) = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}} \\exp(-\\beta E_{i})\n$$\nSubstituting the given energy values:\n$$\nz(\\beta) = \\exp(-\\beta (-\\mu B)) + \\exp(-\\beta (+\\mu B)) = \\exp(\\beta \\mu B) + \\exp(-\\beta \\mu B)\n$$\nThis expression is equivalent to the hyperbolic cosine function multiplied by a factor of $2$:\n$$\nz(\\beta) = 2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the $N$ spins are non-interacting and identical. In the context of a paramagnetic solid, the spins are localized on a lattice and are therefore distinguishable. For a system of $N$ non-interacting, distinguishable subsystems, the total partition function $Z_{N}(\\beta)$ is the product of the individual partition functions:\n$$\nZ_{N}(\\beta) = [z(\\beta)]^{N} = [2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)]^{N}\n$$\n\nSecond, we derive the total internal energy $U(T)$. In the canonical ensemble, the internal energy $U$ is the expectation value of the energy, which can be calculated from the total partition function $Z_{N}(\\beta)$ using the relation:\n$$\nU = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln(Z_{N}(\\beta))\n$$\nWe first compute the natural logarithm of $Z_{N}(\\beta)$:\n$$\n\\ln(Z_{N}(\\beta)) = \\ln([2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)]^{N}) = N \\ln(2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B))\n$$\nNow, we take the partial derivative with respect to $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln(Z_{N}(\\beta)) = N \\frac{1}{2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} [2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule and the derivative of the hyperbolic cosine function, which is $\\frac{d}{dx}\\cosh(x) = \\sinh(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln(Z_{N}(\\beta)) = N \\frac{1}{2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)} \\cdot [2 \\sinh(\\beta \\mu B) \\cdot \\mu B] = N \\mu B \\frac{\\sinh(\\beta \\mu B)}{\\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\ln(Z_{N}(\\beta)) = N \\mu B \\tanh(\\beta \\mu B)\n$$\nTherefore, the internal energy $U$ as a function of $\\beta$ is:\n$$\nU(\\beta) = -N \\mu B \\tanh(\\beta \\mu B)\n$$\nTo express the internal energy as a function of temperature $T$, we substitute $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm B} T}$:\n$$\nU(T) = -N \\mu B \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{k_{\\mathrm B} T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the internal energy.\n\nThird, we analyze the existence of negative-temperature states. The possibility of sustaining a negative temperature state, where $\\beta < 0$, is fundamentally dependent on the energy spectrum of the system. A state of negative temperature is only physically meaningful if the system's energy spectrum is bounded from above. If the spectrum were unbounded, the canonical partition function $Z = \\sum_{i} \\exp(-\\beta E_{i})$ would diverge for any $\\beta < 0$, since the exponential term $\\exp(|\\beta| E_i)$ would grow without limit for arbitrarily large energies $E_i$.\n\nFor the two-level spin system under consideration, the energy of a single spin is confined to the values $-\\mu B$ and $+\\mu B$. Consequently, the total energy of the $N$-spin system is bounded both from below and from above:\n$$\n-N \\mu B \\leq E \\leq +N \\mu B\n$$\nDue to this upper bound on the energy, the sum that defines the partition function $Z_{N}(\\beta)$ is over a finite set of energy levels, and thus it converges for all real values of $\\beta$, including $\\beta < 0$. The expression $Z_{N}(\\beta) = [2 \\cosh(\\beta \\mu B)]^{N}$ is well-defined and finite for all $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$. As a result, all thermodynamic quantities derived from it, including the internal energy $U(\\beta) = -N \\mu B \\tanh(\\beta \\mu B)$, are also well-defined for negative temperatures.\n\nLet us examine the physical implications. A negative temperature corresponds to a state of population inversion, where higher-energy states are more populated than lower-energy states. The ratio of the probabilities of finding a spin in the down state (energy $E_{\\downarrow} = +\\mu B$) versus the up state (energy $E_{\\uparrow} = -\\mu B$) is:\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\downarrow}}{P_{\\uparrow}} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta E_{\\downarrow})}{\\exp(-\\beta E_{\\uparrow})} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\beta \\mu B)}{\\exp(\\beta \\mu B)} = \\exp(-2 \\beta \\mu B)\n$$\nFor a positive temperature, $T > 0$, we have $\\beta > 0$, so $\\exp(-2 \\beta \\mu B) < 1$, and the lower energy state is more populated. For a negative temperature, $T < 0$, we have $\\beta < 0$, so $\\exp(-2 \\beta \\mu B) > 1$. This confirms that the higher energy state is more populated, which is the definition of population inversion.\n\nThe internal energy $U(T)$ ranges from its minimum to its maximum value as temperature traverses the full scale from $0^{+}$ to $0^{-}$.\n- As $T \\to 0^{+}$ ($\\beta \\to +\\infty$), $U(T) \\to -N \\mu B \\tanh(+\\infty) = -N \\mu B$. This is the ground state, with all spins aligned with the field.\n- As $T \\to \\pm\\infty$ ($\\beta \\to 0$), $U(T) \\to -N \\mu B \\tanh(0) = 0$. This is the state of maximum entropy, with equal populations of up and down spins.\n- As $T \\to 0^{-}$ ($\\beta \\to -\\infty$), $U(T) \\to -N \\mu B \\tanh(-\\infty) = -N \\mu B (-1) = +N \\mu B$. This is the highest energy state, with all spins anti-aligned with the field.\n\nThus, negative-temperature states not only exist and are consistent within the canonical formalism for this model but are essential for describing states of the system with an average energy greater than zero. The system must pass through $T=\\infty$ to transition from a positive-temperature state to a negative-temperature state.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-N \\mu B \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\mu B}{k_{\\mathrm B} T}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2811783"}, {"introduction": "Having established the core principles with a discrete system, we now extend our analysis to the continuous realm of classical mechanics.
