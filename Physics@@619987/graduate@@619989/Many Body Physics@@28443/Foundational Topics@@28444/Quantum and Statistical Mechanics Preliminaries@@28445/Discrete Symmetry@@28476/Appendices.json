A magnetic field itself breaks time-reversal symmetry. A simpler way is to note that the perturbation Hamiltonian $H'$ is T-odd. The total Hamiltonian $H_0 + H'$ is no longer time-reversal symmetric, so Kramers' theorem does not apply, and the degeneracy can be lifted.\n\nTo show this explicitly, consider a simple spin-1/2 system where the Kramers doublet can be represented by the spin-up $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ and spin-down $|\\downarrow\\rangle$ states.
