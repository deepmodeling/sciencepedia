We will solve this using the Bethe ansatz.\n\n1.  **The Bethe Ansatz Wavefunction**\n\nThe Bethe ansatz proposes a specific form for the many-body wavefunction. For a system of $N$ particles, the wavefunction in a sector where the particle coordinates are ordered, e.g., $x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_N$, is given by a superposition of plane waves:\n$$\n\\Psi(x_1, \\dots, x_N) = \\sum_{P \\in S_N} A_P \\exp\\left(i \\sum_{j=1}^N k_{P(j)} x_j\\right)\n$$\nwhere $S_N$ is the permutation group of $N$ elements, and $\\{k_j\\}_{j=1}^N$ is a set of distinct quasi-momenta that characterize the state. The coefficients $A_P$ are determined by the particle statistics and interaction.\n\n2.  **Boundary Conditions and the S-matrix**\n\nThe delta-function potential imposes a boundary condition on the wavefunction whenever two particles coincide. Integrating the Schrödinger equation $H\\Psi = E\\Psi$ over an infinitesimal interval around $x_j = x_{j+1}$, we find the cusp condition:\n$$\n\\left. \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{j+1}} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\right) \\Psi \\right|_{x_{j+1} \\to x_j^+} = -\\frac{2mg}{\\hbar^2} \\left. \\Psi \\right|_{x_j = x_{j+1}}\n$$\nApplying this condition to the Bethe wavefunction relates the amplitudes of terms where the momenta $k_j$ and $k_{j+1}$ are swapped. This leads to the two-particle scattering matrix (S-matrix), which for bosons is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{...j+1, j...}}{A_{...j, j+1...}} = S(k_j, k_{j+1}) = \\frac{k_j - k_{j+1} - ic}{k_j - k_{j+1} + ic}\n$$\nwhere $c = mg/\\hbar^2$. Note the sign difference from the repulsive case due to the attractive potential ($g>0$).\n\n3.  **The String Hypothesis for a Bound State**\n\nA bound state corresponds to a solution where the wavefunction decays to zero as any $|x_i| \\to \\infty$. This requires the quasi-momenta $k_j$ to be complex. For the unique $N$-particle bound state, the quasi-momenta form a \"string\" in the complex plane. They share the same real part, which corresponds to the center-of-mass momentum of the cluster, and their imaginary parts are spaced in an arithmetic progression.\n\nFor the ground state, the center-of-mass momentum is zero. The string solution for the quasi-momenta is:\n$$\nk_j = i \\frac{c}{2} (N + 1 - 2j), \\quad \\text{for } j=1, 2, \\dots, N\n$$\nThese quasi-momenta satisfy the consistency relations (Yang-Baxter equations) imposed by the S-matrix structure and lead to a normalizable bound state wavefunction.\n\n4.  **Calculation of the Ground State Energy**\n\nThe total energy of the state is given by the sum of the kinetic energies associated with the quasi-momenta:\n$$\nE_N = \\sum_{j=1}^N \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_j^2}{2m}\n$$\nSubstituting the string solution for $k_j$:\n$$\nE_N = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\sum_{j=1}^N \\left( i \\frac{c}{2} (N + 1 - 2j) \\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nE_N = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( \\frac{c}{2} \\right)^2 (-1) \\sum_{j=1}^N (N + 1 - 2j)^2\n$$\nNow we must evaluate the sum.
