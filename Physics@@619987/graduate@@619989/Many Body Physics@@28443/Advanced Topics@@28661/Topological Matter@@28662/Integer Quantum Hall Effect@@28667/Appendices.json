No numerical evaluation is required.", "solution": "The problem as stated is a standard, well-posed problem in quantum mechanics. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and free of contradiction or ambiguity. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is described by the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + q\\mathbf{A})^2$ for a particle of charge $q$ and mass $m$ in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}$.

First, we verify that this gauge correctly produces the magnetic field: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{L}} = (\\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial z})\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (\\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial x})\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (\\frac{\\partial A_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial A_x}{\\partial y})\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = (0-0)\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + (0-0)\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + (0 - (-B))\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = B\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, which is correct.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ \\left(\\hat{p}_x + qA_x\\right)^2 + \\left(\\hat{p}_y + qA_y\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ (\\hat{p}_x - qBy)^2 + \\hat{p}_y^2 \\right]\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian operator does not depend on the coordinate $x$. Therefore, the operator $\\hat{p}_x = -i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ commutes with the Hamiltonian: $[\\hat{H}, \\hat{p}_x] = 0$. This implies that $\\hat{H}$ and $\\hat{p}_x$ share a common basis of eigenfunctions. We can thus write the eigenfunctions in a separated form, as a product of an eigenfunction of $\\hat{p}_x$ and a function of $y$:\n$$\n\\psi(x, y) = e^{i k_x x} \\phi(y)\n$$\nHere, $\\hbar k_x$ is the eigenvalue of the momentum operator $\\hat{p}_x$, and $k_x$ is a continuous quantum number.\n\nSubstituting this ansatz into the Schrödinger equation $\\hat{H}\\psi = E\\psi$, the action of $\\hat{p}_x$ on $\\psi$ is simply multiplication by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k_x$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ (\\hbar k_x - qBy)^2 + \\hat{p}_y^2 \\right] e^{ik_x x} \\phi(y) = E e^{ik_x x} \\phi(y)\n$$\nThe exponential factor $e^{ik_x x}$ cancels from both sides, leaving a one-dimensional Schrödinger equation for the function $\\phi(y)$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{\\hat{p}_y^2}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2m}(\\hbar k_x - qBy)^2 \\right] \\phi(y) = E \\phi(y)\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional bound-state equation requested.

The energy eigenvalues are independent of the center of the potential $y_0$, and therefore independent of $k_x$.

These are the Landau levels. The energy levels exhibit a high degree of degeneracy due to their independence from the continuous parameter $k_x$.\n\nb) Solution in the Symmetric Gauge\n\nIn the symmetric gauge, the vector potential is $\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{B}{2}(-y, x, 0)$. We again verify the gauge: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(\\frac{Bx}{2}) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-\\frac{By}{2}) = \\frac{B}{2} - (-\\frac{B}{2}) = B$. The gauge is correct.\n\nThe Hamiltonian is:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left[ \\left(\\hat{p}_x - \\frac{qBy}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\hat{p}_y + \\frac{qBx}{2}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nWe shall use an operator method. Let us define the kinetic momentum operators $\\hat{\\Pi}_x = \\hat{p}_x + qA_x$ and $\\hat{\\Pi}_y = \\hat{p}_y + qA_y$. The Hamiltonian is then simply $\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2)$. For the symmetric gauge, these operators are:\n$$\n\\hat{\\Pi}_x = \\hat{p}_x - \\frac{qBy}{2}, \\quad \\hat{\\Pi}_y = \\hat{p}_y + \\frac{qBx}{2}\n$$\nLet us compute the commutator of these two operators, using the canonical commutation relations $[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}_x] = i\\hbar$, $[\\hat{y}, \\hat{p}_y] = i\\hbar$, and all other commutators between $\\{x,y,p_x,p_y\\}$ being zero.\n$$\n[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] = \\left[\\hat{p}_x - \\frac{qBy}{2}, \\hat{p}_y + \\frac{qBx}{2}\\right] = [\\hat{p}_x, \\hat{p}_y] + \\frac{qB}{2}[\\hat{p}_x, x] - \\frac{qB}{2}[y, \\hat{p}_y] - \\frac{q^2B^2}{4}[y, x]\n$$\nThe first and last terms are zero. We use $[\\hat{p}_x, x] = -i\\hbar$ and $[y, \\hat{p}_y] = i\\hbar$.\n$$\n[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] = \\frac{qB}{2}(-i\\hbar) - \\frac{qB}{2}(i\\hbar) = -iqB\\hbar\n$$\nSince this commutator is a non-zero $c$-number, $\\hat{\\Pi}_x$ and $\\hat{\\Pi}_y$ form a Heisenberg algebra, analogous to position and momentum. We can construct bosonic ladder operators. Let's define:\n$$\n\\hat{b} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar|q|B}} (\\hat{\\Pi}_x - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{b}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\hbar|q|B}} (\\hat{\\Pi}_x + i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y)\n$$\nThe commutator of these operators is:\n$$\n[\\hat{b}, \\hat{b}^\\dagger] = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} [ \\hat{\\Pi}_x - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y, \\hat{\\Pi}_x + i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y ] = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} ( i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)[\\hat{\\Pi}_y, \\hat{\\Pi}_x] )\n$$\n$$\n[\\hat{b}, \\hat{b}^\\dagger] = \\frac{2i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)}{2\\hbar|q|B}[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] = \\frac{i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)}{\\hbar|q|B}(-iqB\\hbar) = \\frac{\\text{sgn}(q)qB}{|q|B}\n$$\nSince $\\text{sgn}(q)q = |q|$, the commutator is $[\\hat{b}, \\hat{b}^\\dagger] = 1$. This is the standard bosonic commutation relation.\n\nNow, we express the Hamiltonian in terms of these operators. We construct the number operator $\\hat{N} = \\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b}$:\n$$\n\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} (\\hat{\\Pi}_x + i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y) (\\hat{\\Pi}_x - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)\\hat{\\Pi}_y) = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} \\left( \\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)[\\hat{\\Pi}_x, \\hat{\\Pi}_y] \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the value of the commutator:\n$$\n\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} \\left( \\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 - i\\,\\text{sgn}(q)(-iqB\\hbar) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} \\left( \\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 - \\text{sgn}(q)qB\\hbar \\right)\n$$\nAgain using $\\text{sgn}(q)q = |q|$:\n$$\n\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} = \\frac{1}{2\\hbar|q|B} \\left( \\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 - |q|B\\hbar \\right)\n$$\nWe can now express the kinetic energy term $\\hat{\\Pi}_x^2+\\hat{\\Pi}_y^2$ in terms of $\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\Pi}_x^2+\\hat{\\Pi}_y^2 = 2\\hbar|q|B\\,\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} + \\hbar|q|B = \\hbar|q|B(2\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} + 1)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Hamiltonian expression $\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\Pi}_x^2 + \\hat{\\Pi}_y^2)$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2m} \\hbar|q|B(2\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} + 1) = \\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}\\left(\\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis Hamiltonian is equivalent to that of a quantum harmonic oscillator with frequency $\\omega_c = \\frac{|q|B}{m}$. The eigenvalues of the number operator $\\hat{N} = \\hat{b}^\\dagger \\hat{b}$ are the non-negative integers $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. Therefore, the energy eigenvalues are:\n$$\nE_n = \\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\hbar\\omega_c\\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\nc) Comparison and Final Result\n\nThe energy eigenvalues obtained in part (a) using the Landau gauge are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}$.\nThe energy eigenvalues obtained in part (b) using the symmetric gauge are $E_n = (n + \\frac{1}{2})\\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}$.\n\nThe two results are identical. This outcome is required by the principle of gauge invariance in quantum mechanics, which states that physical observables, such as energy eigenvalues, cannot depend on the choice of gauge for the electromagnetic potentials. The different gauges lead to different forms for the wavefunctions and different conserved quantities (linear momentum in Landau gauge, angular momentum in symmetric gauge), but the energy spectrum, which is a physical observable, remains the same.\n\nThe common, gauge-independent spectrum of energy levels for a charged particle in a two-dimensional plane under a perpendicular magnetic field is known as the Landau level spectrum. The expression for these energy levels is:\n$$\nE_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is a non-negative integer quantum number ($n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$), $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $q$ is the charge of the particle, $m$ is its mass, and $B$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{E_n = \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\hbar|q|B}{m}}\n$$", "id": "2830255"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable precision of the quantization in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect points to a deep underlying physical principle: topological protection.

Rearranging the terms, we have:\n$$\n\\Sigma(E) [E - E_n - \\Sigma(E)] = \\frac{W}{2\\pi \\ell_{B}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma(E)^2 - (E - E_n)\\Sigma(E) + \\frac{W}{2\\pi \\ell_{B}^{2}} = 0\n$$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $\\Sigma(E)$ yields:\n$$\n\\Sigma(E) = \\frac{(E - E_n) \\pm \\sqrt{(E - E_n)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{W}{2\\pi \\ell_{B}^{2}}\\right)}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(E - E_n) \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(E - E_n)^2 - \\frac{2W}{\\pi \\ell_{B}^{2}}}\n$$\nThe retarded self-energy $\\Sigma(E)$ must have a non-positive imaginary part, $\\operatorname{Im}\\Sigma(E) \\le 0$, which ensures a non-negative density of states $\\rho(E) = -(\\pi W)^{-1} \\operatorname{Im}\\Sigma(E) \\ge 0$. The imaginary part of $\\Sigma(E)$ is non-zero only when the argument of the square root is negative:\n$$\n(E - E_n)^2 - \\frac{2W}{\\pi \\ell_{B}^{2}} < 0 \\implies |E - E_n| < \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\pi \\ell_{B}^{2}}}\n$$\nLet us define the parameter $\\Gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\pi \\ell_{B}^{2}}}$. The imaginary part is non-zero in the energy interval $|E - E_n| < \\Gamma$. Within this interval, the solution for $\\Sigma(E)$ is:\n$$\n\\Sigma(E) = \\frac{1}{2}(E - E_n) \\pm \\frac{i}{2}\\sqrt{\\Gamma^2 - (E - E_n)^2}\n$$\nTo satisfy the condition $\\operatorname{Im}\\Sigma(E) \\le 0$, we must select the minus sign. Thus, the physical solution for the retarded self-energy is:\n$$\n\\Sigma(E) = \\frac{1}{2}(E - E_n) - \\frac{i}{2}\\sqrt{\\Gamma^2 - (E - E_n)^2}\n$$\nfor $|E - E_n| < \\Gamma$, and is real otherwise. The imaginary part is $\\operatorname{Im}\\Sigma(E) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\Gamma^2 - (E - E_n)^2}$, which corresponds to a semicircular density of states for the broadened Landau level.\n\nThe problem defines the Landau level broadening $\\Gamma$ as the half-width of the support of the resulting density of states. The support is the energy interval where $\\operatorname{Im}\\Sigma(E)$ is non-zero, which we found to be $[E_n - \\Gamma, E_n + \\Gamma]$. The full width of this interval is $2\\Gamma$, and the half-width is indeed $\\Gamma$.\nTherefore, the Landau level broadening $\\Gamma$ is given by our definition:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\pi \\ell_{B}^{2}}}\n$$\nThis provides the final expression for $\\Gamma$ in terms of the given parameters $W$ and $\\ell_B$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2W}{\\pi \\ell_{B}^{2}}}}\n$$", "id": "2830259"}]}
