Hamiltonian and Eigenstates**\n\nThe Hamiltonian is given by $H(k) = \\mathbf{d}(k) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. With the provided $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ and setting $a=1$, the Hamiltonian matrix is:\n$$\nH(k) = d_x(k) \\sigma_x + d_y(k) \\sigma_y = (t_1 + t_2 \\cos k) \\sigma_x + (t_2 \\sin k) \\sigma_y\n$$\n$$\nH(k) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & d_x(k) - i d_y(k) \\\\ d_x(k) + i d_y(k) & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & h^*(k) \\\\ h(k) & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere we have defined the complex function $h(k) = d_x(k) + i d_y(k)$.\n$$\nh(k) = (t_1 + t_2 \\cos k) + i (t_2 \\sin k) = t_1 + t_2 e^{ik}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of $H(k)$ are easily found:\n$$\nE_{\\pm}(k) = \\pm \\sqrt{d_x(k)^2 + d_y(k)^2} = \\pm |h(k)| = \\pm \\sqrt{(t_1+t_2\\cos k)^2 + (t_2\\sin k)^2} = \\pm \\sqrt{t_1^2 + t_2^2 + 2t_1 t_2 \\cos k}\n$$\nThe system is insulating as long as $t_1 \\ne t_2$, which keeps the gap open for all $k$. The filled band is the lower energy band, the valence band, corresponding to the eigenvalue $E_-(k) = -|h(k)|$.\n\nLet's find the corresponding eigenvector $|u_-(k)\\rangle$. We write $h(k)$ in polar form: $h(k) = |h(k)| e^{i\\phi(k)}$.\nThe eigenvector equation is $H(k)|u_-(k)\\rangle = E_-(k)|u_-(k)\\rangle$. Let $|u_-(k)\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & |h(k)|e^{-i\\phi(k)} \\\\ |h(k)|e^{i\\phi(k)} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix} = -|h(k)| \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 \\\\ c_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis gives two equations:\n$|h(k)|e^{-i\\phi(k)} c_2 = -|h(k)| c_1 \\implies c_1 = -e^{-i\\phi(k)} c_2$.\n$|h(k)|e^{i\\phi(k)} c_1 = -|h(k)| c_2 \\implies c_2 = -e^{i\\phi(k)} c_1$.\nThese are consistent.

Berry Connection and Zak Phase**\n\nThe Zak phase is defined as $\\gamma_Z = i \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\langle u_-(k) | \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} | u_-(k) \\rangle dk$.\nFirst, we compute the derivative of the eigenvector:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} |u_-(k)\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\begin{pmatrix} -e^{-i\\phi(k)} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} -(-i \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial k})e^{-i\\phi(k)} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} i \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial k} e^{-i\\phi(k)} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the inner product $\\langle u_-(k) | \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} | u_-(k) \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle u_-(k) | = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} -e^{i\\phi(k)} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle u_-(k) | \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} | u_-(k) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -e^{i\\phi(k)} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} i \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial k} e^{-i\\phi(k)} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -e^{i\\phi(k)} \\cdot i \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial k} e^{-i\\phi(k)} \\right) = -\\frac{i}{2}\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial k}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this into the integral for the Zak phase:\n$$\n\\gamma_Z = i \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\left(-\\frac{i}{2}\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial k}\\right) dk = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial k} dk = \\frac{1}{2} [\\phi(\\pi) - \\phi(-\\pi)]\n$$\nThe Zak phase is half the total change in the phase $\\phi(k)$ as $k$ sweeps across the first Brillouin zone.\n\n**3. Winding Number of d(k)**\n\nThe phase $\\phi(k)$ is the argument of the complex number $h(k) = d_x(k) + i d_y(k)$. The quantity $[\\phi(\\pi) - \\phi(-\\pi)]$ represents the total angle swept by the vector $\\mathbf{d}(k)=(d_x(k), d_y(k))$ in the plane as $k$ goes from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$. This is $2\\pi$ times the winding number of the path around the origin.\n\nThe path is described by $d_x(k) = t_1 + t_2 \\cos k$ and $d_y(k) = t_2 \\sin k$. This is a circle of radius $t_2$ centered at $(t_1, 0)$ in the $(d_x, d_y)$ plane.\n\nThe problem specifies the non-trivial regime, $t_2 > t_1 > 0$.\nIn this case, the center of the circle $(t_1, 0)$ is closer to the origin than its radius $t_2$. Therefore, the circular path traced by $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ encloses the origin $(0,0)$.\n\nLet's trace the path as $k$ goes from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$:\n*   At $k = -\\pi$: $\\mathbf{d}(-\\pi) = (t_1 - t_2, 0)$. Since $t_2 > t_1$, this point is on the negative $d_x$ axis.\n*   At $k = 0$: $\\mathbf{d}(0) = (t_1 + t_2, 0)$. This point is on the positive $d_x$ axis.\n*   At $k = \\pi$: $\\mathbf{d}(\\pi) = (t_1 - t_2, 0)$. The path is closed.\n\nAs $k$ increases from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$, the vector $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ starts on the negative real axis, sweeps counter-clockwise through the plane, and returns to its starting point, completing one full rotation around the origin. The winding number is therefore 1.\n\nThe total change in phase is the winding number multiplied by $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\phi = \\phi(\\pi) - \\phi(-\\pi) = 1 \\times 2\\pi = 2\\pi\n$$\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\nSubstituting this result into our expression for the Zak phase:\n$$\n\\gamma_Z = \\frac{1}{2} [\\phi(\\pi) - \\phi(-\\pi)] = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\pi) = \\pi\n$$\nThus, the Zak phase for the non-trivial topological phase is $\\pi$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi}\n$$", "id": "1171155"}, {"introduction": "After calculating a polarization value, we must ask what this number physically represents.
