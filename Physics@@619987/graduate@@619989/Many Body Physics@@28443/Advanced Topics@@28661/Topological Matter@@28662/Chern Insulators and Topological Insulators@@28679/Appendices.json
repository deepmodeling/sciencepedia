The model consists of a lattice with a two-site basis (sublattices A and B) per unit cell. The hopping amplitude for an electron to move between sites within the same unit cell is $v$, while the hopping amplitude between adjacent unit cells is $w$. We assume the lattice constant is $a=1$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian in momentum space, for a given crystal momentum $k$ in the first Brillouin zone $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, can be written in the basis of the A and B sublattices as:\n$$\nH(k) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & v + w e^{-ik} \\\\ v + w e^{ik} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis can be expressed compactly using the Pauli matrices $\\vec{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ as $H(k) = \\vec{d}(k) \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}$, where the vector $\\vec{d}(k)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{d}(k) = \\big( d_x(k), d_y(k), d_z(k) \\big) = \\big( v + w \\cos(k), w \\sin(k), 0 \\big)\n$$\nThe parameters $v$ and $w$ are real, positive hopping amplitudes.\n\nThe topology of the electronic bands can be characterized by the Zak phase, which is the Berry phase acquired by an electron in a specific band as its momentum $k$ is varied across the entire Brillouin zone.
