All definitions and relationships are consistent with established theory. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution can be constructed directly from the provided definitions.\n\nThe task is to derive the relationship between the electronic filling factor $\\nu$ and the composite fermion filling factor $\\nu^{*}$, and then apply it to specific cases. We are given the following definitions:\n1.  The electronic filling factor: $\\nu = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{B}$, where $n_{e}$ is the electron number density, $\\phi_{0} = h/e$ is the magnetic flux quantum, and $B$ is the external magnetic field.\n2.

The flux is parallel to $B$, leading to a reduced effective field.\n3.  The composite fermion filling factor: $\\nu^{*} = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{B^{*}}$.\n\nOur first goal is to derive the mapping between $\\nu$ and $\\nu^{*}$. We can achieve this by expressing $B$ and $B^{*}$ in terms of $\\nu$, $\\nu^{*}$, and other parameters, and then establishing a relationship between them.\n\nFrom the definition of $\\nu$, we can express the external magnetic field $B$ as:\n$$B = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{\\nu}$$\nSimilarly, from the definition of $\\nu^{*}$, we can express the effective magnetic field $B^{*}$ as:\n$$B^{*} = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{\\nu^{*}}$$\nNow, substitute these two expressions into the definition of the effective magnetic field, $B^{*} = B - 2p\\,n_{e}\\phi_{0}$:\n$$\\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{\\nu^{*}} = \\frac{n_{e}\\phi_{0}}{\\nu} - 2p\\,n_{e}\\phi_{0}$$\nThe term $n_{e}\\phi_{0}$ is common to all terms and is non-zero, so we can divide the entire equation by it:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\nu^{*}} = \\frac{1}{\\nu} - 2p$$\nThis equation provides the general mapping between the inverse filling factors. We can also express $\\nu$ in terms of $\\nu^{*}$ and vice versa.\nSolving for $\\nu$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{\\nu^{*}} + 2p = \\frac{1 + 2p\\nu^{*}}{\\nu^{*}}$$\n$$\\nu = \\frac{\\nu^{*}}{1 + 2p\\nu^{*}}$$\nAnd solving for $\\nu^{*}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\nu^{*}} = \\frac{1 - 2p\\nu}{\\nu}$$\n$$\\nu^{*} = \\frac{\\nu}{1 - 2p\\nu}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we are asked to apply this mapping for the specific case where $p=1$. The relationship becomes:\n$$\\nu^{*} = \\frac{\\nu}{1 - 2\\nu}$$\nWe need to compute the value of $\\nu^{*}$ for two given electronic filling factors, $\\nu = 2/5$ and $\\nu = 3/7$.\n\nFor $\\nu = 2/5$:\n$$\\nu^{*} = \\frac{2/5}{1 - 2(2/5)} = \\frac{2/5}{1 - 4/5} = \\frac{2/5}{1/5} = 2$$\nThus, for an electronic filling factor of $\\nu=2/5$, the composite fermion filling factor is $\\nu^{*}=2$.\n\nFor $\\nu = 3/7$:\n$$\\nu^{*} = \\frac{3/7}{1 - 2(3/7)} = \\frac{3/7}{1 - 6/7} = \\frac{3/7}{1/7} = 3$$\nThus, for an electronic filling factor of $\\nu=3/7$, the composite fermion filling factor is $\\nu^{*}=3$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to predict the corresponding number of filled CF Landau levels for these two cases. The problem statement itself provides the rule: \"Composite fermions fill an integer number of CF Landau levels when $\\nu^{*}$ is an integer.\" Since our calculated values for $\\nu^{*}$ are integers in both cases, the value of $\\nu^{*}$ directly corresponds to the number of filled CF Landau levels.\nFor $\\nu = 2/5$, we found $\\nu^{*} = 2$, which implies that the composite fermions completely fill $2$ Landau levels.\nFor $\\nu = 3/7$, we found $\\nu^{*} = 3$, which implies that the composite fermions completely fill $3$ Landau levels.\n\nThe problem asks for the final pair of answers $(\\nu^{*}\\text{ at }\\nu=2/5,\\ \\nu^{*}\\text{ at }\\nu=3/7)$ as a row vector.

The filling fraction $\\nu=2/5$ corresponds to the Jain state with $m=2$ filled $\\Lambda$-levels and $p=1$ (meaning $2p=2$ flux quanta are attached per electron). The relation between electron monopole strength $S_{GS}$ and CF monopole strength $S^*_{GS}$ for the ground state is given by $S = S^* + p(N-1)$.

Quasielectron State Configuration**\n\nA quasielectron state is formed by adding one flux quantum to the ground state. The new electron monopole strength $S_{qe}$ is related to the ground state one $S_{GS}$ by $2S_{qe} = 2S_{GS} + 1$.\nUsing the relation $S=S^*+p(N-1)$ with $p=1$, we can find the new CF monopole strength $S^*_{qe}$.\nFirst, let's find $2S_{GS}$ in terms of $N$:\n$$2S_{GS} = 2S^*_{GS} + 2p(N-1) = 2\\left(\\frac{N-4}{4}\\right) + 2(1)(N-1) = \\frac{N-4}{2} + 2N-2 = \\frac{N-4+4N-4}{2} = \\frac{5N-8}{2}$$\nThe flux for the quasielectron state is:\n$$2S_{qe} = 2S_{GS}+1 = \\frac{5N-8}{2} + 1 = \\frac{5N-6}{2}$$\nNow we find the new CF monopole strength $S^*_{qe}$ from the relation $2S_{qe} = 2S^*_{qe} + 2p(N-1)$:\n$$2S^*_{qe} = 2S_{qe} - 2p(N-1) = \\frac{5N-6}{2} - 2(1)(N-1) = \\frac{5N-6 - 4(N-1)}{2} = \\frac{5N-6-4N+4}{2} = \\frac{N-2}{2}$$\n$$S^*_{qe} = \\frac{N-2}{4}$$\n\n**3.

We must determine how these $N$ CFs occupy the available $\\Lambda$-levels to form the lowest-energy state. The lowest energy is achieved by occupying the lowest available $\\Lambda$-levels.\nThe two lowest $\\Lambda$-levels have angular momenta:\n-   $k=0$: $l_0 = S^*_{qe} + 0 = \\frac{N-2}{4}$\n-   $k=1$: $l_1 = S^*_{qe} + 1 = \\frac{N-2}{4} + 1 = \\frac{N+2}{4}$\n\nThe number of available single-particle states in these levels are:\n-   $k=0$: $N_0^{\\text{states}} = 2l_0+1 = 2\\left(\\frac{N-2}{4}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{N-2}{2} + 1 = \\frac{N}{2}$\n-   $k=1$: $N_1^{\\text{states}} = 2l_1+1 = 2\\left(\\frac{N+2}{4}\\right) + 1 = \\frac{N+2}{2} + 1 = \\frac{N+4}{2} = \\frac{N}{2}+2$\n\nThe lowest energy configuration places as many CFs as possible in the lowest ($k=0$) $\\Lambda$-level. This level can hold exactly $N/2$ CFs.\nSo, we fill the $k=0$ level completely with $N_0 = N/2$ CFs.\nThe remaining $N_1 = N - N_0 = N - N/2 = N/2$ CFs are placed in the $k=1$ $\\Lambda$-level.\n\n**4. Calculating the Total Angular Momentum**\n\nThe total angular momentum of the electron state is identical to that of the CF state.\n-   The $k=0$ $\\Lambda$-level is completely filled, so its contribution to the total angular momentum is zero ($L_0=0$).\n-   The $k=1$ $\\Lambda$-level is partially filled. It has $N_1 = N/2$ CFs in $N_1^{\\text{states}} = N/2+2$ available states. This configuration is equivalent to having 2 holes in an otherwise filled shell. The angular momentum of this shell is $l_1 = (N+2)/4$.\n\nThe total angular momentum of the quasielectron state $L_{qe}$ is determined by the angular momentum of the two holes in the $l_1$ shell. The electrons are spin-polarized, so the CFs are treated as identical fermions. For two identical fermions in a shell with angular momentum $l_1$, the total two-particle wavefunction must be antisymmetric. Since the spin part is symmetric (both spins are aligned), the spatial part of the wavefunction must be antisymmetric. This restricts the possible values of the total orbital angular momentum $L$ to be odd integers.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the lowest-energy configuration for particles (or holes) with a repulsive interaction corresponds to the state with the maximum possible total angular momentum $L$. For two identical fermions in a shell $l_1$, the maximum antisymmetric state has $L=2l_1-1$.\n\nThe total angular momentum of the quasielectron state is thus:\n$$L_{qe} = L_{\\text{max}} = 2l_1 - 1$$\nSubstituting the expression for $l_1$:\n$$L_{qe} = 2\\left(\\frac{N+2}{4}\\right) - 1$$\n$$L_{qe} = \\frac{N+2}{2} - 1 = \\frac{N+2-2}{2} = \\frac{N}{2}$$\nThe orbital angular momentum of the lowest-energy quasielectron excitation is $N/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{N}{2}}$$", "id": "1112745"}]}
