## Introduction
In the quantum world of crystalline solids, the behavior of electrons is governed by their [energy band structure](@article_id:264051). Conventionally, we classify materials as metals, with overlapping bands, or insulators, with a definitive energy gap. But what happens in the curious case where the valence and conduction bands meet at isolated points or lines in momentum space, and are prevented from gapping out by a deeper, topological law? This question opens the door to the realm of [topological semimetals](@article_id:137306), a fascinating class of [quantum matter](@article_id:161610) that blurs the lines between [metals and insulators](@article_id:148141), hosting exotic electron behaviors with no classical analogue. This article addresses the fundamental principles and observable consequences of these materials, offering a comprehensive overview of this cutting-edge field of physics.

Throughout this exploration, you will first delve into the **Principles and Mechanisms** that give rise to these states, uncovering the [topological invariants](@article_id:138032) like [chirality](@article_id:143611) and Berry phase that protect Weyl nodes and nodal lines, and see how they mandate the existence of remarkable [surface states](@article_id:137428) like Fermi arcs and [drumhead states](@article_id:145387). Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, you will discover the profound impact of this topology on measurable physical phenomena, from novel electrical transport effects like the [chiral anomaly](@article_id:141583) to unique thermodynamic signatures and surprising links to [high-energy physics](@article_id:180766). Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will provide an opportunity to solidify your understanding by tackling concrete analytical problems. Our journey begins by questioning a familiar picture in solid-state physics: the ubiquity of the band gap.

## Principles and Mechanisms

If you've ever looked at a band diagram for a simple crystal like silicon, you might have noticed something comforting: the lines representing [energy bands](@article_id:146082) rarely, if ever, cross. There's almost always a gap between the valence bands, filled with electrons, and the conduction bands, which are empty. This gap is what makes silicon an insulator (or a semiconductor, if the gap is small). We get used to this idea that energy levels "repel" each other. But what if they didn't? What if we could find a situation where bands not only touch but are *forced* to touch by some deep, underlying principle? This is the gateway to the world of [topological semimetals](@article_id:137306).

### The Loneliness of a Point: Birth of a Weyl Node

Let's play a game. Imagine you are an electron moving through a crystal. Your properties, like energy, are described by a Hamiltonian, which is just a matrix that depends on your momentum, $\mathbf{k}$. For many simple but profound cases, this can be a tiny $2 \times 2$ matrix of the form:

$$H(\mathbf{k}) = d_x(\mathbf{k})\sigma_x + d_y(\mathbf{k})\sigma_y + d_z(\mathbf{k})\sigma_z$$

Here, the $\sigma$ matrices are the famous Pauli matrices, and the functions $d_x, d_y, d_z$ change with your momentum. The energy of the two bands are simply $E_{\pm}(\mathbf{k}) = \pm \sqrt{d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2}$. The bands touch—meaning the gap vanishes—if and only if the energy is zero. This requires the vector $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k}) = (d_x, d_y, d_z)$ to be zero.

Now, how hard is it to make this vector vanish? In a three-dimensional world, your momentum $\mathbf{k}$ has three components to tune: $k_x$, $k_y$, and $k_z$. You need to simultaneously satisfy three equations: $d_x(\mathbf{k})=0$, $d_y(\mathbf{k})=0$, and $d_z(\mathbf{k})=0$. Three variables, three equations. As any student of algebra knows, this is the sweet spot! You can generically find isolated solutions. In momentum space, these solutions are just points.

These special points of touching are called **Weyl nodes**. Near one of these nodes, say at $\mathbf{k}_0$, the functions $d_i(\mathbf{k})$ typically behave linearly. So, for a small deviation $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{k} - \mathbf{k}_0$, the Hamiltonian looks something like this:

$$H(\mathbf{q}) \approx v_x q_x \sigma_x + v_y q_y \sigma_y + v_z q_z \sigma_z$$

This is the [canonical form](@article_id:139743) of a Weyl Hamiltonian. These points are not just accidental touchings. They are robust, stable features of the [band structure](@article_id:138885). Unlike an "accidental" touching where, for instance, one of the linear terms is missing, a Weyl node cannot be easily removed by small perturbations like strain or impurities. But why? What gives them this immense stability? The answer, as it so often is in modern physics, lies in topology. [@problem_id:3024309]

### The Unshakable Soul: Topological Chirality

Weyl nodes possess a property that is much like an electric charge. It's a quantized, integer value that cannot be changed by small, continuous deformations. We call this property **[chirality](@article_id:143611)**, denoted by $\chi$. It describes the "handedness" of the node—whether it is left-handed or right-handed.

Imagine standing at the Weyl node where $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})=\mathbf{0}$. Now, take a small step away in some direction. The vector $\mathbf{d}$ is no longer zero; it points somewhere. If you walk on the surface of a tiny sphere in momentum space centered on the node, the vector $\mathbf{d}(\mathbf{k})$ will trace out its own path on a different sphere. The [chirality](@article_id:143611) is simply the number of times the $\mathbf{d}$-vector wraps around its sphere as you traverse your sphere in momentum space once. For a simple Weyl node, this number is either $+1$ or $-1$. [@problem_id:1135130]

Mathematically, this winding number is determined by the orientation of the mapping from $\mathbf{k}$ to $\mathbf{d}$. If we write the linear approximation as $d_i(\mathbf{k}) \approx \sum_j M_{ij} q_j$, the chirality is simply the sign of the determinant of the matrix $M$. A [non-zero determinant](@article_id:153416) means the mapping is volumetric and has a definite orientation, leading to $\chi = \mathrm{sgn}(\det(M)) = \pm 1$. A zero determinant would mean the map flattens the volume to a plane or a line, resulting in zero winding and no [topological protection](@article_id:144894). [@problem_id:3024257]

This integer charge is a *topological invariant*. You can't get rid of it by gently nudging the system. A node with charge $+1$ can only be destroyed if it meets and annihilates with a node of charge $-1$—particle-[antiparticle](@article_id:193113) [annihilation](@article_id:158870), but in [momentum space](@article_id:148442)! This is the source of their stability.

This also leads to a powerful constraint, the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem: in any crystal, the sum of the chiralities of all Weyl nodes must be zero. This means Weyl nodes must come in pairs (or fours, or some other even number). A material can't have just one. This simple rule has profound consequences. For example, in a material that has [time-reversal symmetry](@article_id:137600) (where the laws of physics look the same if you run time backwards), it forces Weyl nodes to come in sets of at least four. [@problem_id:1135081] Similarly, high [crystal symmetry](@article_id:138237) can force any node to be replicated multiple times throughout the Brillouin zone, making a single pair of nodes impossible in, say, a body-centered cubic crystal. [@problem_id:1135099]

### A Line in the Sand: From Weyl Points to Nodal Lines

We found Weyl points by solving three equations in three variables. What if we lived in a world constrained by a symmetry that guaranteed one of the components of our $\mathbf{d}$-vector was always zero? For example, a symmetry might enforce $d_z(\mathbf{k})=0$ everywhere.

Now, we only need to solve two equations, $d_x(\mathbf{k})=0$ and $d_y(\mathbf{k})=0$, in our three-dimensional [momentum space](@article_id:148442). The solution to this is no longer an [isolated point](@article_id:146201), but a continuous line! This is a **[nodal line semimetal](@article_id:136527)**. The conduction and valence bands touch along a 1D curve, which often forms a ring inside the Brillouin zone.

Symmetries like the combination of time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) can provide exactly this kind of protection. A system with this $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can often be described by a Hamiltonian that is purely real, forbidding any term proportional to the imaginary Pauli matrix $\sigma_y$. [@problem_id:1135076]

Nodal lines also have a topological signature, but it's different from the point-charge of a Weyl node. Imagine a closed loop in [momentum space](@article_id:148442) that *links* through the nodal ring, like a link in a chain. If an electron in a single band were to be adiabatically guided along this path, it would acquire a special geometric phase, known as the **Berry phase**. For any loop that links a simple nodal line, this phase is precisely $\pi$. [@problem_id:1135131] [@problem_id:1135135] This non-trivial phase is a tell-tale sign of the linked nodal line and is robust; any deformation of the path that doesn't un-link it from the line will give the same $\pi$ phase. In contrast, a loop that does not encircle the line will have a trivial Berry phase of 0 (or $2\pi$). [@problem_id:1135141] This quantized $\pi$ phase is the topological invariant protecting the nodal line. Other symmetries, such as glide symmetries, can also protect nodal lines that carry this characteristic $\pi$ Berry phase. [@problem_id:1135063]

### The Edge of the World: Fermi Arcs and Drumhead States

So, these materials have strange points or lines in their bulk. Who cares? We live in a world with surfaces. The true magic happens when a [topological semimetal](@article_id:158413) is cut, creating a boundary. This is where the principle of **bulk-boundary correspondence** comes into play: the non-[trivial topology](@article_id:153515) of the bulk *demands* the existence of exotic states at the surface.

For a Weyl semimetal, this correspondence gives rise to one of the most celebrated phenomena in the field: **Fermi arcs**. On the surface of the material, the map of states available to electrons at a constant energy (the Fermi surface) is not made of closed loops, as in a normal metal. Instead, there are open arcs! Each arc is a continuous electronic state that begins at the projection of a bulk Weyl node of one chirality onto the surface and stretches across the surface Brillouin zone to terminate at the projection of a node with the opposite chirality. [@problem_id:3024294] It's as if the bulk monopoles are connected by a string of surface states. These arcs are not a hypothesis; they have been stunningly observed in experiments.

Nodal line semimetals have their own surface-state surprise. When a nodal ring in the bulk is projected onto a surface, a peculiar thing happens. The entire two-dimensional region of the surface Brillouin zone *enclosed* by the projected nodal ring hosts a [flat band](@article_id:137342) of zero-energy states. This is called a **drumhead state**, because it resembles the flat, vibrating surface of a drum. [@problem_id:1135079] [@problem_id:1135128] These states are localized at the surface, decaying exponentially into the bulk, and their existence is a direct consequence of the $\pi$ Berry phase of the bulk nodal line. [@problem_id:1135095]

### A Topological Zoo: Chains, Links, and Beyond

The simple pictures of isolated Weyl points and single nodal rings are just the beginning. The interplay between topology and crystal symmetry creates a veritable zoo of complex structures.

By breaking a symmetry that protects a nodal line, for instance with a magnetic field, the line can gap out, leaving behind a pair of Weyl nodes where the gap closes first. In this way, a nodal line can be seen as a parent to Weyl points. [@problem_id:1135058]

Furthermore, different nodal lines can intersect, forming **nodal chains**, where two rings touch at a point. [@problem_id:1135105] Or, even more mind-bendingly, they can be intertwined without touching, forming **nodal links** that resemble the links of a chain. [@problem_id:1135112] Each of these structures has its own unique set of topological invariants and corresponding surface states.

The field is even pushing into entirely new territory, such as **non-Hermitian** physics, which describes systems with gain or loss. In such systems, Weyl points can smear out into rings of "[exceptional points](@article_id:199031)," opening up yet another chapter in this fascinating story. [@problem_id:1135083]

From simple points to lines, arcs, and drums, the principles of topology provide a powerful and beautiful framework for understanding these new [states of matter](@article_id:138942). They show us that even in the seemingly abstract world of electron bands, there are deep structures and connections waiting to be discovered, right at the boundary between the known and the unknown.
