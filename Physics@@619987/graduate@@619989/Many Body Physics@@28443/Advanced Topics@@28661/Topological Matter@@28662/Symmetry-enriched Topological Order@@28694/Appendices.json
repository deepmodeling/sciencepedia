Its elementary excitations are abelian anyons: the electric charge $e$, the magnetic flux $m$, and their composite, the dyon $\\epsilon=em$. The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code depends on the topology of the manifold on which it is defined. For the purposes of this problem, you may take the following as given: on a Mobius strip, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric code has a GSD of 2. The two-dimensional ground state space $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{GS}}$ can be spanned by two orthonormal states, $\\{|\\psi_1\\rangle, |\\psi_e\\rangle\\}$. These basis states can be understood as arising from the two sectors of the parent theory on a cylinder that are invariant under the glide reflection that turns the cylinder into a Mobius strip, corresponding to the identity (1) and electric ($e$) anyon flux propagating along the cylinder.\n\nNow, consider this system in the presence of a global on-site $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, represented by a unitary operator $U$. This symmetry enriches the topological order, leading to a symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phase. The defining characteristic of this SET phase is how the symmetry acts on the anyons. We specify that the symmetry fractionalizes non-trivially on the electric anyon $e$. This means that a state with an isolated $e$ anyon is not invariant under the symmetry operation, but instead transforms projectively, acquiring a phase of $-1$. The magnetic anyon $m$, in contrast, transforms trivially (with a phase of $+1$). The identity anyon $1$ is always invariant. The transformation property of the dyon $\\epsilon$ is determined by the fusion rules.

The ground states are simultaneous eigenstates of all $A_s$ and $B_p$ with eigenvalue $+1$.\n\nOn a torus with non-trivial cycles $C_1$ and $C_2$, the ground state degeneracy (GSD) is 4. This 4-dimensional space can be described as two logical qubits. The logical Pauli operators are given by Wilson loops of $\\sigma^z$ and $\\sigma^x$ operators along the cycles.

The operator $T_a$ that translates the system by one lattice constant along the cycle $C_a$ acts on the ground-state subspace as the logical operator that transports an 'm' particle along the dual cycle $C_a^*$. For the standard toric code on a square lattice, this corresponds to the logical operator $X_b$, where $C_b$ is the cycle orthogonal to $C_a$ (i.e., if $a=1$, $b=2$ and vice-versa). Specifically, $T_1$ acts as $X_2$ and $T_2$ acts as $X_1$ on the logical qubits.\n\nThe problem is to determine the ground state degeneracy of this SET phase on a torus where a single non-trivial symmetry flux line for the generator $g$ is threaded through the cycle $C_1$.", "solution": "1.
