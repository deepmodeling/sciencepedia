The potential $V(|\\phi|^2)$ contains mass and self-interaction terms, which are not relevant for the topological properties.\n\nIn this theory, the gauge field becomes non-dynamical in the usual sense (it has no propagating degrees of freedom), but it attaches a fictitious magnetic flux to each charged particle. The presence of this \"statistical\" flux tube means that when one particle is moved around another, it accumulates an Aharonov-Bohm phase. This phase contributes to the particle's statistics, transmuting the original boson into an anyon.\n\nAnyons are particles in two spatial dimensions whose exchange statistics are intermediate between those of bosons and fermions.

This practice illuminates how complex correlated states emerge from the principle of flux attachment.", "problem": "In the theory of the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE), the concept of composite fermions (CFs) provides a powerful framework for understanding strongly correlated electron states. A composite fermion is a bound state of an electron and an even number of magnetic flux quanta, denoted by $2m$. The FQHE state of electrons at a filling factor $\\nu$ can often be mapped to a simpler Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) state of these composite fermions at an effective filling factor $\\nu^*$.\n\nThis mapping from a composite fermion wavefunction $\\Psi_{CF}$ to the corresponding electron wavefunction $\\Psi_e$ is realized through a singular gauge transformation, which mathematically amounts to multiplying $\\Psi_{CF}$ by a Jastrow correlation factor. For attaching $2m$ flux quanta to each particle, this factor is $J(\\{z_j\\}) = \\prod_{j<k} (z_j - z_k)^{2m}$, where $z_j = x_j + i y_j$ is the complex coordinate of the $j$-th particle in two dimensions.\n\nThe wavefunctions for particles in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) in the symmetric gauge are of the form $\\Psi(\\{z_j\\}) = P(\\{z_j\\}) \\prod_{i=1}^N \\exp(-|z_i|^2 / (4\\ell_B^2))$, where $P(\\{z_j\\})$ is a polynomial in the particle coordinates that is antisymmetric under particle exchange, and $\\ell_B$ is the magnetic length. The total orbital angular momentum of such a state is determined by the total degree of the polynomial $P(\\{z_j\\})$, with $L_z = \\hbar \\times (\\text{Total Degree of } P)$.\n\nConsider a system of $N$ interacting electrons that form a Laughlin FQHE state. This state can be constructed starting from a ground state of $N$ non-interacting composite fermions that completely fill their own lowest effective Landau level, corresponding to an IQHE state with filling factor $\\nu^*=1$. The wavefunction for these composite fermions, $\\Psi_{CF}$, is given by the Slater determinant of the $N$ lowest energy single-particle LLL wavefunctions.

Determine the Wavefunction of the Initial Composite Fermion State**\n\nThe initial state is that of $N$ composite fermions completely filling their lowest Landau level ($\\nu^*=1$). The single-particle wavefunctions in the LLL are labeled by a non-negative integer $k$, representing their angular momentum in units of $\\hbar$. To fill the LLL with $N$ fermions, we must occupy the states with $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots, N-1$.\n\nThe many-body wavefunction, $\\Psi_{CF}$, is the Slater determinant of these single-particle wavefunctions:\n$$ \\Psi_{CF}(\\{z_j\\}) = \\mathcal{N}_{CF} \\det \\left[ \\phi_{k-1}(z_j) \\right]_{j,k=1,\\dots,N} $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}_{CF}$ is a normalization constant. The single-particle wavefunctions are $\\phi_k(z) = C_k (z/\\ell_B)^k e^{-|z|^2/(4\\ell_B^2)}$, where $C_k$ is a normalization constant.\n\nThe total orbital angular momentum of a LLL state is determined by its polynomial part. Let's extract the polynomial part, $P_{CF}$, of $\\Psi_{CF}$.\n$$ P_{CF}(\\{z_j\\}) \\propto \\det \\left[ (z_j/\\ell_B)^{k-1} \\right]_{j,k=1,\\dots,N} $$\nWe can factor out the constants $(\\ell_B)^{-k+1}$ from each column. These affect only the overall normalization, so we can write:\n$$ P_{CF}(\\{z_j\\}) \\propto \\det \\left[ z_j^{k-1} \\right]_{j,k=1,\\dots,N} $$\nThis is a Vandermonde determinant, which has a well-known expansion:\n$$ \\det \\left[ z_j^{k-1} \\right] = \\prod_{1 \\le j < k \\le N} (z_k - z_j) $$\nSo, the polynomial part of the composite fermion wavefunction is (up to a constant factor):\n$$ P_{CF}(\\{z_j\\}) = \\prod_{1 \\le j < k \\le N} (z_k - z_j) $$\n\n**2.

The polynomial part of the electron wavefunction, $P_e$, is therefore the product of the polynomial parts of the Jastrow factor and the CF wavefunction.\n$$ P_e(\\{z_j\\}) = J(\\{z_j\\}) \\cdot P_{CF}(\\{z_j\\}) $$\n$$ P_e(\\{z_j\\}) = \\left( \\prod_{1 \\le j < k \\le N} (z_j - z_k)^{2m} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{1 \\le j < k \\le N} (z_k - z_j) \\right) $$\nSince $(z_k - z_j) = - (z_j - z_k)$, we can write the Jastrow factor as $\\prod_{j<k} (z_k - z_j)^{2m}$ without changing its value because the exponent is even.\n$$ P_e(\\{z_j\\}) = \\left( \\prod_{1 \\le j < k \\le N} (z_k - z_j)^{2m} \\right) \\left( \\prod_{1 \\le j < k \\le N} (z_k - z_j) \\right) $$\nCombining the terms gives:\n$$ P_e(\\{z_j\\}) = \\prod_{1 \\le j < k \\le N} (z_k - z_j)^{2m+1} $$\nThis is the polynomial part of the Laughlin wavefunction for filling factor $\\nu = 1/(2m+1)$.\n\n**3. Calculate the Total Orbital Angular Momentum**\n\nThe total orbital angular momentum, $L_e$, is $\\hbar$ times the total degree of the polynomial $P_e(\\{z_j\\})$. The polynomial $P_e$ is a product of terms, so its total degree is the sum of the degrees of its factors.\n\nThe factors are of the form $(z_k - z_j)^{2m+1}$. The degree of each such factor is $2m+1$.\nThe number of such factors is the number of pairs $(j,k)$ with $1 \\le j < k \\le N$. This is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N}{2}$.\n$$ \\text{Number of factors} = \\binom{N}{2} = \\dfrac{N(N-1)}{2} $$\nThe total degree of $P_e$ is the product of the degree per factor and the number of factors:\n$$ \\text{Total Degree} = (2m+1) \\times \\dfrac{N(N-1)}{2} $$\nFinally, the total orbital angular momentum $L_e$ is:\n$$ L_e = \\hbar \\times (\\text{Total Degree}) = \\hbar (2m+1) \\dfrac{N(N-1)}{2} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\hbar (2m+1) \\dfrac{N(N-1)}{2}} $$", "id": "1200894"}, {"introduction": "Statistical transmutation can lead to particles even more exotic than Abelian anyons, known as non-Abelian anyons, which form the basis for topological quantum computation.
