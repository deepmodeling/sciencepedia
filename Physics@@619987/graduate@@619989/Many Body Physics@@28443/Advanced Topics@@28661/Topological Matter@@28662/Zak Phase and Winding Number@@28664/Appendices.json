[@problem_id:1225030]", "problem": "**Winding Number of a 1D Two-Band Topological Model**\n\nIn condensed matter physics, many one-dimensional systems with two bands per unit cell can be described by a $2 \\times 2$ Bloch Hamiltonian of the general form:\n$$\nH(k) = \\mathbf{d}(k) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = d_x(k)\\sigma_x + d_y(k)\\sigma_y + d_z(k)\\sigma_z\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the crystal momentum, defined within the first Brillouin Zone (BZ), $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, and $\\mathbf{d}(k)$ is a real vector that depends on the microscopic details of the model.\n\nFor systems where the Hamiltonian can be written as $H(k) = d_x(k)\\sigma_x + d_z(k)\\sigma_z$ (i.e., $d_y(k)=0$), the energy eigenvalues are $E_\\pm(k) = \\pm\\sqrt{d_x(k)^2 + d_z(k)^2}$. The system is gapped if $|\\mathbf{d}(k)| \\neq 0$ for all $k$ in the BZ. Such gapped systems can be classified by a topological invariant known as the winding number, $W$. This integer value characterizes the topology of the mapping from the BZ (which has the topology of a circle, $S^1$) to the space of gapped Hamiltonians.\n\nGeometrically, the winding number $W$ counts how many times the vector $\\mathbf{d}(k) = (d_x(k), d_z(k))$ encircles the origin in the $d_x-d_z$ plane as $k$ traverses the BZ, e.g., from $k=0$ to $k=2\\pi$. The winding number is related to other topological quantities like the Zak phase, which is the Berry phase acquired by a Bloch state across the BZ.\n\nThe winding number can be formally calculated via the integral:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{d_x(k) \\frac{d}{dk}d_z(k) - d_z(k) \\frac{d}{dk}d_x(k)}{d_x(k)^2 + d_z(k)^2} dk\n$$\n\n**Problem:**\nConsider a 1D two-band model described by the Hamiltonian $H(k) = d_x(k)\\sigma_x + d_z(k)\\sigma_z$, with the components of the $\\mathbf{d}$-vector given by:\n$$\nd_x(k) = t \\sin(ka)\n$$\n$$\nd_z(k) = M - t \\cos(ka)\n$$\nwhere $t$ is a hopping parameter, $M$ is a mass-like parameter, and $a$ is the lattice constant. For simplicity, set $t=1$ and $a=1$.\n\nCompute the winding number $W$ for this model when the mass parameter is $M = 1/2$.", "solution": "**1. Model Specification**\n\nThe Hamiltonian for this problem is given by $H(k) = d_x(k)\\sigma_x + d_z(k)\\sigma_z$. With the specified parameters $t=1$, $a=1$, and $M=1/2$, the components of the $\\mathbf{d}$-vector are:\n$$\nd_x(k) = \\sin(k)\n$$\n$$\nd_z(k) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\cos(k)\n$$\nThe winding number $W$ characterizes the path traced by the point $(d_x(k), d_z(k))$ in the plane as $k$ varies over the Brillouin zone, which we take to be the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\n**2. Geometric Interpretation**\n\nA direct and intuitive way to find the winding number is to analyze the geometry of the path traced by $\\mathbf{d}(k)$. The parametric equations for the path are:\n$$\nd_x = \\sin(k)\n$$\n$$\nd_z = \\frac{1}{2} - \\cos(k)\n$$\nWe can identify the shape of this path by eliminating the parameter $k$. Rearranging the second equation gives $\\cos(k) = 1/2 - d_z$. We can use the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(k) + \\cos^2(k) = 1$:\n$$\nd_x^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - d_z\\right)^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\nd_x^2 + \\left(d_z - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = 1\n$$\nThis is the equation of a circle in the $(d_x, d_z)$ plane. The circle is centered at $(0, 1/2)$ and has a radius of $R=1$.\n\nThe winding number is non-zero if and only if this path encloses the origin $(0,0)$. For a circle centered at $(C_x, C_z)$ with radius $R$, the origin is enclosed if the distance of the center from the origin is less than the radius, i.e., $\\sqrt{C_x^2 + C_z^2} < R$.\n\nIn our case, the center is at $(0, 1/2)$. The distance from the origin is $\\sqrt{0^2 + (1/2)^2} = 1/2$. The radius is $R=1$.\nSince $1/2 < 1$, the circular path encloses the origin. Therefore, the winding number is a non-zero integer.\n\nTo determine the value of $W$, we need to check how many times the path winds around the origin and in what direction. As $k$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$, the point $(d_x(k), d_z(k))$ traverses the circle exactly once. We check the direction of traversal (orientation):\n- At $k=0$: $(d_x, d_z) = (\\sin 0, 1/2 - \\cos 0) = (0, -1/2)$.\n- At $k=\\pi/2$: $(d_x, d_z) = (\\sin(\\pi/2), 1/2 - \\cos(\\pi/2)) = (1, 1/2)$.\n- At $k=\\pi$: $(d_x, d_z) = (\\sin \\pi, 1/2 - \\cos \\pi) = (0, 3/2)$.\n- At $k=3\\pi/2$: $(d_x, d_z) = (\\sin(3\\pi/2), 1/2 - \\cos(3\\pi/2)) = (-1, 1/2)$.\n- At $k=2\\pi$: $(d_x, d_z) = (0, -1/2)$.\n\nThe path starts at $(0, -1/2)$, moves right to $(1, 1/2)$, up to $(0, 3/2)$, left to $(-1, 1/2)$, and back down to $(0, -1/2)$. This constitutes a single, counter-clockwise loop around the origin. By convention, a counter-clockwise winding corresponds to a positive winding number. Since the path makes one full loop, the winding number is $W=1$.\n\n**3. Analytic Calculation (Verification)**\n\nWe can verify this result using the integral formula for $W$. Let $m=1/2$.\nFirst, calculate the required derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dk}d_x(k) = \\frac{d}{dk}\\sin(k) = \\cos(k)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dk}d_z(k) = \\frac{d}{dk}(m - \\cos(k)) = \\sin(k)\n$$\nThe numerator of the integrand is:\n$$\nd_x d_z' - d_z d_x' = \\sin(k)(\\sin(k)) - (m - \\cos(k))(\\cos(k)) = \\sin^2(k) - m\\cos(k) + \\cos^2(k) = 1 - m\\cos(k)\n$$\nThe denominator of the integrand is:\n$$\nd_x^2 + d_z^2 = \\sin^2(k) + (m - \\cos(k))^2 = \\sin^2(k) + m^2 - 2m\\cos(k) + \\cos^2(k) = 1 + m^2 - 2m\\cos(k)\n$$\nThe winding number integral is:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1 - m\\cos(k)}{1 + m^2 - 2m\\cos(k)} dk\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we can rewrite the integrand. Notice that the numerator can be related to the denominator:\n$$\n1-m\\cos(k) = \\frac{1}{2} (2 - 2m\\cos(k)) = \\frac{1}{2} ((1+m^2 - 2m\\cos(k)) - (m^2-1))\n$$\nSo, the integrand becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1 - m\\cos(k)}{1 + m^2 - 2m\\cos(k)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - \\frac{m^2-1}{1 + m^2 - 2m\\cos(k)}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we integrate:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{1}{2} dk - \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{m^2-1}{2} \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{dk}{1+m^2-2m\\cos(k)}\n$$\nThe first term is $\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{2\\pi}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. For the second integral, we use the standard result $\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{a+b\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}$ for $a > |b|$. Here, $a=1+m^2$ and $b=-2m$. The condition $a>|b|$ becomes $1+m^2 > |-2m|$, which is $(1-|m|)^2 > 0$, true for $|m| \\neq 1$.\nThe term in the square root is $a^2-b^2 = (1+m^2)^2 - (-2m)^2 = 1+2m^2+m^4 - 4m^2 = (1-m^2)^2$. Thus, $\\sqrt{a^2-b^2} = |1-m^2|$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $W$:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{m^2-1}{4\\pi} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{|1-m^2|}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{m^2-1}{2|1-m^2|}\n$$\nNow, we substitute $m=1/2$. Since $|m|=1/2 < 1$, we have $1-m^2 > 0$, so $|1-m^2| = 1-m^2$.\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{(1/2)^2-1}{2(1-(1/2)^2)} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1/4-1}{2(1-1/4)} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{-3/4}{2(3/4)} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1\n$$\nBoth the geometric and analytical methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "1225030"}, {"introduction": "While the winding number offers a geometric picture, the Zak phase provides an equivalent description rooted in the Berry phase concept.
