Independence of Constraints**\n\nWe must check if these three constraints are independent. We can do this by multiplying the three gauge operators together. Since Pauli operators on different links commute, and $(\\sigma_l^x)^2 = \\mathbb{I}_l$ (the identity on link $l$), we have:\n$$\nG_1 G_2 G_3 = (\\sigma_1^x \\sigma_3^x) (\\sigma_1^x \\sigma_2^x) (\\sigma_2^x \\sigma_3^x) = (\\sigma_1^x)^2 (\\sigma_2^x)^2 (\\sigma_3^x)^2 = \\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathbb{I} = \\mathbb{I}_{\\text{total}}\n$$\nThis result, $G_1 G_2 G_3 = \\mathbb{I}$, shows that the operators are not independent. For example, $G_3 = G_1 G_2$. If a state satisfies the constraints for $G_1$ and $G_2$, it automatically satisfies the constraint for $G_3$:\n$$\nG_3 |\\psi\\rangle = (G_1 G_2) |\\psi\\rangle = G_1 (G_2 |\\psi\\rangle) = G_1 |\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle\n$$\nTherefore, there are only two independent constraints.

This procedure is a form of Kramers-Wannier duality adapted for quantum Hamiltonians, often known as Wegner duality.\n\n**1. Lattice Duality**\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the honeycomb lattice $\\mathcal{L}_H$ and the triangular lattice $\\mathcal{L}_T$. The triangular lattice is the geometric dual of the honeycomb lattice. We can construct the dual lattice $\\mathcal{L}_H^*$ by placing a vertex at the center of each plaquette (hexagon) of $\\mathcal{L}_H$ and connecting vertices of adjacent plaquettes with a link. This construction yields a triangular lattice. Thus, $\\mathcal{L}_H^* = \\mathcal{L}_T$.\n\nThis duality establishes the following correspondences:\n-   Plaquettes $p$ of $\\mathcal{L}_H$ $\\longleftrightarrow$ Vertices $i$ of $\\mathcal{L}_T$.\n-   Links $l$ of $\\mathcal{L}_H$ $\\longleftrightarrow$ Links $l^*$ of $\\mathcal{L}_T$.\n-   Vertices $v$ of $\\mathcal{L}_H$ $\\longleftrightarrow$ Plaquettes (triangles) $p^*$ of $\\mathcal{L}_T$.\n\n**2. Operator Mapping**\n\nWe define a new set of spin operators $\\tau_i$ on the vertices of the dual lattice $\\mathcal{L}_T$. The duality is defined by the following mapping between the operators of the gauge theory and the operators of the Ising model.\n\n-   The plaquette operator $A_p$ of the gauge theory, associated with a plaquette $p \\in \\mathcal{L}_H$, is mapped to the $\\tau_i^x$ operator on the corresponding dual vertex $i \\in \\mathcal{L}_T$:\n    $$ A_p = \\prod_{l \\in \\partial p} \\sigma_l^z \\quad \\longleftrightarrow \\quad \\tau_i^x $$\n-   The link operator $\\sigma_l^x$ of the gauge theory, associated with a link $l \\in \\mathcal{L}_H$, is mapped to a product of $\\tau^z$ operators on the two vertices $i, j$ of the dual link $l^*$ that crosses $l$:\n    $$ \\sigma_l^x \\quad \\longleftrightarrow \\quad \\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z $$\n\n**3. Verification of the Algebra**\n\nWe must check if this mapping preserves the algebraic structure of the operators. The key relations in the original theory are the commutation relations between $A_p$ and $\\sigma_l^x$.\n-   If link $l$ is part of the boundary of plaquette $p$, then $\\sigma_l^x$ and $A_p$ anticommute, i.e., $\\{\\sigma_l^x, A_p\\} = 0$, because $\\sigma_l^x$ anticommutes with one $\\sigma_l^z$ in the product for $A_p$ and commutes with all others.\n-   If link $l$ is not on the boundary of plaquette $p$, then $[\\sigma_l^x, A_p] = 0$.\n\nLet's check the algebra of the dual operators. The link $l$ corresponds to a dual link $(i,j)$ and the plaquette $p$ to a dual vertex $i$.\n-   The corresponding dual operators are $\\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z$ and $\\tau_i^x$. Let's compute their anticommutator:\n    $$ \\{\\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z, \\tau_i^x\\} = (\\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z)\\tau_i^x + \\tau_i^x(\\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z) $$\n    Since operators on different sites commute ($\\tau_j^z$ with $\\tau_i^x, \\tau_i^z$) and operators on the same site anticommute ($\\{\\tau_i^x, \\tau_i^z\\}=0$), we have:\n    $$ \\{\\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z, \\tau_i^x\\} = \\tau_j^z (\\tau_i^z \\tau_i^x) + \\tau_i^x \\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z = \\tau_j^z (-\\tau_i^x \\tau_i^z) + \\tau_i^x \\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z = -\\tau_i^x \\tau_j^z \\tau_i^z + \\tau_i^x \\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z = -\\tau_i^x \\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z + \\tau_i^x \\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z = 0 $$\n    This matches the anticommutation relation of the original operators.\n-   If $l$ is not on the boundary of $p$, its dual link $(k,m)$ does not share a vertex with the dual vertex $i$. Thus, the operators $\\tau_k^z \\tau_m^z$ and $\\tau_i^x$ act on disjoint sets of vertices and commute, which is also consistent.\n\n**4. Mapping the Hamiltonian**\n\nNow we apply the duality transformation to the Hamiltonian $H_G$:\n-   The plaquette term: $-J \\sum_p A_p$ maps to $-J \\sum_i \\tau_i^x$.\n-   The transverse field term: $-h \\sum_l \\sigma_l^x$ maps to $-h \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z$, where the sum is over all links of the dual lattice, i.e., nearest neighbors in the triangular lattice.\n\nThe transformed Hamiltonian is:\n$$ H' = -h \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\tau_i^z \\tau_j^z - J \\sum_i \\tau_i^x $$\nThis is exactly the Hamiltonian $H_I$ of the transverse field Ising model on the triangular lattice $\\mathcal{L}_T$, with the couplings identified as $K=h$ and $\\Gamma=J$.\n\n**5. Mapping the Gauge Constraint**\n\nFinally, we must consider the gauge constraint $G_v = 1$. A vertex $v$ in the honeycomb lattice has three incident links, say $l_1, l_2, l_3$. In the dual lattice, this vertex $v$ corresponds to a triangular plaquette $p^*$, whose boundary is formed by the three dual links $l_1^*, l_2^*, l_3^*$. Let the vertices of this dual triangle be $i_1, i_2, i_3$. The dual links are then $(i_1, i_2)$, $(i_2, i_3)$, and $(i_3, i_1)$.\n\nThe gauge operator $G_v = \\sigma_{l_1}^x \\sigma_{l_2}^x \\sigma_{l_3}^x$ is mapped as follows:\n$$ G_v \\quad \\longleftrightarrow \\quad (\\tau_{i_1}^z \\tau_{i_2}^z) (\\tau_{i_2}^z \\tau_{i_3}^z) (\\tau_{i_3}^z \\tau_{i_1}^z) $$\nUsing $(\\tau^z)^2 = 1$, we can simplify the product:\n$$ (\\tau_{i_1}^z \\tau_{i_2}^z) (\\tau_{i_2}^z \\tau_{i_3}^z) (\\tau_{i_3}^z \\tau_{i_1}^z) = \\tau_{i_1}^z (\\tau_{i_2}^z \\tau_{i_2}^z) (\\tau_{i_3}^z \\tau_{i_3}^z) \\tau_{i_1}^z = \\tau_{i_1}^z (1) (1) \\tau_{i_1}^z = (\\tau_{i_1}^z)^2 = 1 $$\nThe gauge constraint $G_v = 1$ is mapped to the identity $1=1$ in the dual theory. This means the constraint is automatically satisfied by the dual variables. Therefore, the physical Hilbert space of the gauge theory (the subspace satisfying all constraints) maps to the entire Hilbert space of the Ising model.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that there exists a one-to-one mapping between the gauge-invariant sector of the Z2 gauge theory on a honeycomb lattice and the full theory of the transverse field Ising model on a triangular lattice. The Hamiltonians map onto each other with an exchange of coupling constants. Thus, the two theories are dual.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "1155698"}]}
