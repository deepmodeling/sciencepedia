A key operation involves a two-qubit quantum gate, which is implemented by exciting a pair of atoms to a highly excited Rydberg state. When two atoms are simultaneously in this state, they interact via a van der Waals potential. For the specific Rydberg state used, this interaction potential energy $V(R)$ as a function of the inter-atomic distance $R$ is well-approximated by $V(R) = C_6 / R^6$.\n\nThe process of exciting an atom from its ground state to the Rydberg state is driven by a laser with a characteristic coupling strength, described by the Rabi frequency $\\Omega$. A crucial phenomenon known as the 'Rydberg blockade' occurs when the interaction energy between two atoms becomes strong enough to shift the atomic transition out of resonance with the driving laser. A useful length scale for this effect, the blockade radius $R_b$, can be estimated by finding the distance at which the magnitude of the van der Waals interaction energy equals the energy associated with the laser coupling.\n\nGiven the following parameters for the system:\n- The magnitude of the van der Waals coefficient is $|C_6| = 4.00 \\times 10^{-58} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{m}^6$.\n- The Rabi frequency of the excitation laser is $\\Omega = 3.80 \\times 10^6 \\text{ rad/s}$.\n- The reduced Planck constant is $\\hbar = 1.05 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n\nCalculate the Rydberg blockade radius, $R_b$.
