In complex coordinates $z = x^1 + i x^2$ and $\\bar{z} = x^1 - i x^2$, the field can be decomposed into holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts, $\\phi(z, \\bar{z})$. We will focus on the holomorphic part, denoted by $\\phi(z)$.

To make these operators well-defined at short distances, we use normal ordering. For any two operators $X$ and $Y$, the normal-ordered product is defined as $:XY: = XY - \\langle XY \\rangle$. For products of normal-ordered operators built from free fields, like $:X_1 \\dots X_n: :Y_1 \\dots Y_m:$, their vacuum expectation value is calculated using Wick's theorem by summing over all possible ways of fully contracting the fields, where each contraction must connect a field from the first normal-ordered block to a field in the second.\n\nThe state-operator correspondence is a key principle in CFT. It maps a local operator $O(z)$ to a state $|O\\rangle$ in the theory's Hilbert space, defined via $|O\\rangle = \\lim_{z\\to 0} O(z) |\\text{vac}\\rangle$. The squared norm of this state, $\\langle O | O \\rangle$, is determined by the leading singularity in the operator product expansion (OPE) of $O(z)$ with its conjugate.
