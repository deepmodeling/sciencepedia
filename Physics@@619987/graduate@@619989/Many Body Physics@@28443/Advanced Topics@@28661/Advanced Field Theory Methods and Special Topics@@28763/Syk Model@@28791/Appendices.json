These Majorana fermions are represented by Hermitian operators $\\psi_i$ (for $i=1, \\dots, N$) that obey the Clifford algebra relation:\n$$\n\\{\\psi_i, \\psi_j\\} = \\psi_i \\psi_j + \\psi_j \\psi_i = 2\\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe standard $q$-local SYK Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH_{\\text{SYK}} = i^{q/2} \\sum_{1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_q \\le N} J_{i_1 i_2 \\dots i_q} \\psi_{i_1} \\psi_{i_2} \\dots \\psi_{i_q}\n$$\nIn this expression, $q$ is a fixed even integer representing the number of fermions in each interaction term. The coupling constants $J_{i_1 i_2 \\dots i_q}$ are taken to be independent real-valued random variables, typically drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The sum is taken over all possible sets of $q$ distinct indices in increasing order.\n\nGiven the parameters $N$ and $q$, determine the total number of independent coupling constants, $D(N,q)$, present in the $H_{\\text{SYK}}$ Hamiltonian. Provide the answer as a closed-form expression in terms of $N$ and $q$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of independent coupling constants in the SYK Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is defined as:\n$$\nH_{\\text{SYK}} = i^{q/2} \\sum_{1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_q \\le N} J_{i_1 i_2 \\dots i_q} \\psi_{i_1} \\psi_{i_2} \\dots \\psi_{i_q}\n$$\nThe coupling constants are the coefficients $J_{i_1 i_2 \\dots i_q}$. The problem states that these are independent real-valued parameters. Therefore, the total number of independent couplings is equal to the number of terms in the summation.\n\nThe summation runs over all possible sets of indices $\\{i_1, i_2, \\dots, i_q\\}$ that satisfy the condition $1 \\le i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_q \\le N$. This condition is a standard convention to ensure that each distinct interaction is counted exactly once.\n1.  The strict inequality $i_1 < i_2 < \\dots < i_q$ ensures that all the indices in a given term are distinct.\n2.  For any given set of $q$ distinct fermion indices, there is only one way to arrange them in increasing order. This means that each possible set of $q$ interacting fermions corresponds to exactly one term in the sum and thus one independent coupling constant.\n\nDue to the anticommutation relations of the Majorana fermions ($\\psi_i \\psi_j = -\\psi_j \\psi_i$ for $i \\neq j$), any other ordering of the indices for a given set of fermions would produce a term proportional to the one with ordered indices. For instance, a term with $\\psi_{i_2}\\psi_{i_1}\\dots$ can be rewritten as $-\\psi_{i_1}\\psi_{i_2}\\dots$ and its coupling absorbed into the definition of $J_{i_1 i_2 \\dots i_q}$. The summation over strictly ordered indices provides a minimal and complete basis for the interactions.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to a purely combinatorial one: counting the number of ways to choose $q$ distinct indices from the set of $N$ available indices $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. The order in which we choose the indices does not matter, as the summation convention fixes the order uniquely.\n\nThis is a classic \"combinations\" problem. The number of ways to choose an unordered subset of $q$ elements from a set of $N$ elements is given by the binomial coefficient, denoted as $\\binom{N}{q}$ or $C(N, q)$.\n\nThe formula for the binomial coefficient is:\n$$\n\\binom{N}{q} = \\frac{N!}{q!(N-q)!}\n$$\nwhere $k!$ denotes the factorial of $k$.\n\nThis formula directly counts the number of terms in the sum. Since each term has one independent coupling constant $J_{i_1 i_2 \\dots i_q}$, the total number of independent coupling constants $D(N,q)$ is:\n$$\nD(N,q) = \\binom{N}{q}\n$$\nThis expression is valid for integers $N, q$ where $0 \\le q \\le N$. If $q > N$, it is impossible to choose $q$ distinct indices from $N$ fermions, so the sum in the Hamiltonian is empty, and the number of couplings is 0. The binomial coefficient correctly captures this, as $\\binom{N}{q} = 0$ for $q > N$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{N!}{q!(N-q)!}} $$", "id": "1202041"}, {"introduction": "While the SYK Hamiltonian appears complex, its true power is revealed in the large-$N$ limit, where it becomes analytically tractable.
