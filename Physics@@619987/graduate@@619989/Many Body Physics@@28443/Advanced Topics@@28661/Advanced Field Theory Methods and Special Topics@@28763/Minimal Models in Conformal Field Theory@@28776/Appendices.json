For a WZW model constructed from a simple Lie algebra $g$, the central charge is given by the formula:\n$$\nc_g(k) = \\frac{k \\cdot \\text{dim}(g)}{k + h^\\vee}\n$$\nwhere $\\text{dim}(g)$ is the dimension of the Lie algebra and $h^\\vee$ is its dual Coxeter number.

For a Lie group $G$ with a subgroup $H$, the coset model $G/H$ is a CFT whose stress-energy tensor is effectively the difference between that of the $G$ and $H$ theories. This leads to a simple rule for the central charge: $c_{G/H} = c_G - c_H$.

The Hamiltonian $H$ that generates translations along the infinite direction $u$ is related to the Virasoro generators of the theory.\n\nThe boundaries at $v=0$ and $v=L$ must be supplied with boundary conditions. A conformal boundary condition is one that preserves the full Virasoro algebra, which ensures that the energy-momentum tensor has no anomalous behavior at the boundary.

Express your answer in terms of $p$, $p'$, and $L$.", "solution": "The solution involves relating the Hamiltonian on the strip to the Virasoro generators, determining the spectrum of states for the given boundary conditions, and then extracting the lowest energy eigenvalue.\n\n**1. Hamiltonian on the Strip**\n\nA CFT on an infinite strip of width $L$ can be analyzed by conformally mapping it to a more convenient geometry, such as the upper half-plane (UHP). The map $z(w) = e^{\\pi w/L}$ maps the strip in the $w$-plane ($w=u+iv$, $0 \\le v \\le L$) to the UHP in the $z$-plane.\n\nIn this transformed picture, the Hamiltonian $H$ that generates translations in the $u$ direction on the strip is related to the dilatation operator $L_0$ on the plane. For an open string theory, which is the appropriate description for a strip with boundaries, the Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$H = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left(L_0^{\\text{open}} - \\frac{c}{24}\\right)$$\nHere, $c$ is the central charge of the CFT, and $L_0^{\\text{open}}$ is the Virasoro zero-mode for the open string Hilbert space. The eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian give the energy spectrum of the theory on the strip.\n\n**2. Vacuum Energy (Casimir Energy)**\n\nThe vacuum energy, or Casimir energy $E_0$, is the lowest possible eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian $H$. This corresponds to the state with the minimum eigenvalue of $L_0^{\\text{open}}$. Let this minimum eigenvalue be $h_{\\text{min}}$.\n$$E_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left(h_{\\text{min}} - \\frac{c}{24}\\right)$$\n\n**3. Spectrum for Conformal Boundary Conditions**\n\nThe Hilbert space of the open string, $\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{open}}$, depends on the boundary conditions at the two edges of the strip. For conformal boundary conditions corresponding to primary fields $\\phi_a$ and $\\phi_b$, the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{ab}$ decomposes into a direct sum of Virasoro representations $\\mathcal{V}_k$ associated with the primary fields $\\phi_k$ of the bulk theory:\n$$\\mathcal{H}_{ab} = \\bigoplus_k N_{ab}^k \\mathcal{V}_k$$\nHere, $N_{ab}^k$ are the fusion coefficients of the theory, which specify the content of the operator product expansion (OPE) of $\\phi_a \\times \\phi_b$. The eigenvalues of $L_0^{\\text{open}}$ on this space are of the form $h_k + n$, where $h_k$ is the conformal dimension of a primary $\\phi_k$ for which $N_{ab}^k \\neq 0$, and $n$ is any non-negative integer (from the Virasoro descendants).\n\nThe lowest eigenvalue, $h_{\\text{min}}$, is therefore the minimum conformal dimension among all primary fields $\\phi_k$ that appear in the fusion product of the boundary fields:\n$$h_{\\text{min}} = \\min \\{h_k \\,|\\, N_{ab}^k \\neq 0\\}$$\n\n**4. Applying the Specific Boundary Condition**\n\nThe problem specifies that the same boundary condition is applied to both edges, and this condition corresponds to the identity primary field $\\phi_{1,1}$. Thus, we have $a=b=(1,1)$. We need to find the spectrum determined by the fusion rule $\\phi_{1,1} \\times \\phi_{1,1}$.\n\nThe identity field $\\phi_{1,1}$ acts as the identity element in the fusion algebra. Its fusion rule is:\n$$\\phi_{1,1} \\times \\phi_{1,1} = \\phi_{1,1}$$\nThis means the only fusion coefficient that is non-zero is $N_{(1,1)(1,1)}^{(1,1)} = 1$. Consequently, the Hilbert space contains only the Virasoro representation of the identity field:\n$$\\mathcal{H}_{(1,1)(1,1)} = \\mathcal{V}_{1,1}$$\nThe spectrum of $L_0^{\\text{open}}$ is therefore given by the conformal dimension of $\\phi_{1,1}$ and its descendants. The conformal dimension of the identity primary field $\\phi_{1,1}$ is always zero:\n$$h_{1,1} = 0$$\nThe eigenvalues of $L_0^{\\text{open}}$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$. The minimum value is clearly:\n$$h_{\\text{min}} = h_{1,1} = 0$$\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nSubstituting $h_{\\text{min}}=0$ into the expression for the Casimir energy $E_0$:\n$$E_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left(0 - \\frac{c}{24}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi c}{24L}$$\nThis is a universal result for any CFT with the specified identity boundary conditions. Now, we substitute the central charge for the $\\mathcal{M}(p, p')$ minimal model:\n$$c = 1 - 6 \\frac{(p-p')^2}{pp'}$$\nThe Casimir energy is:\n$$E_0 = -\\frac{\\pi}{24L} \\left(1 - 6 \\frac{(p-p')^2}{pp'}\\right)$$\nThis can be rearranged slightly for clarity:\n$$E_0 = -\\frac{\\pi}{24L} + \\frac{6\\pi(p-p')^2}{24Lpp'} = \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\left(\\frac{(p-p')^2}{4pp'} - \\frac{1}{24}\\right)$$\nThis is the final expression for the Casimir energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{\\pi}{24L} \\left(1 - 6 \\frac{(p-p')^2}{pp'}\\right)}$$", "id": "1170601"}]}
