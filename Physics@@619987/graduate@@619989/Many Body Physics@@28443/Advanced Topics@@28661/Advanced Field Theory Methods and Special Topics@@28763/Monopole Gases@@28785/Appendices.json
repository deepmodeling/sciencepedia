At low temperatures, the spin configurations obey the 'ice rule': on each tetrahedron, two spins point in and two spins point out.\n\nExcitations above this ground state manifold correspond to tetrahedra that violate the ice rule, having a 'three-in, one-out' or 'one-in, three-out' spin configuration. These local defects behave as mobile, emergent magnetic monopoles and antimonopoles, carrying a magnetic charge of magnitude $q_m$. These quasiparticles form a dilute gas within the material.\n\nThe dynamics of this monopole gas at a finite temperature $T$ can be described by drift and diffusion processes.
