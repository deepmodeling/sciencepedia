The degrees of freedom are qubits located on the edges of the lattice. The stabilizer group is generated by two types of operators:\n\n1.  **Vertex operators ($A_v$):** For each vertex $v$ of the lattice, the operator $A_v$ is the product of Pauli-$X$ operators on the six edges that meet at the vertex.\n2.  **Cube operators ($B_c$):** For each elementary cube $c$ in the lattice, the operator $B_c$ is the product of Pauli-$Z$ operators on the 12 edges forming the cube.\n\nThe stabilizer group $S$ is the abelian group generated by all such $A_v$ and $B_c$ operators that can be defined on the given lattice.

An elementary cube has 12 edges. Each edge hosts one qubit.

For our region $A$, which is itself an elementary cube, the corresponding operator $B_c = \\prod_{e \\in \\partial c} Z_e$ acts on all 12 edges of the cube. Since all these edges are within $A$, this operator is supported entirely on $A$. This gives us one $Z$-type stabilizer.\n    - **Vertex operators ($A_v$):** A vertex operator $A_v = \\prod_{e \\ni v} X_e$ acts on the six edges meeting at vertex $v$. For any of the 8 vertices of our cubic region $A$, 3 of the edges meeting at that vertex are part of the cube $A$, and 3 edges point outside of $A$. Therefore, no single vertex operator $A_v$ is supported entirely within $A$. Similarly, no product of vertex operators can be constructed that acts non-trivially only on edges inside $A$ and as the identity outside $A$.\n\n    Thus, the only stabilizer generator supported entirely within region $A$ is the cube operator $B_c$ corresponding to that cube.
