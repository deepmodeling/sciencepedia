This exercise provides crucial practice in applying variational principles to assess the stability of exotic phases of matter.", "problem": "**Title:** The Stability of Strange Quark Matter in the MIT Bag Model\n\n**Background:**\nThe Bodmer-Witten hypothesis posits that strange quark matter (SQM), a bulk state of matter composed of roughly equal numbers of up (u), down (d), and strange (s) quarks, might be the absolute ground state of matter at zero pressure and temperature. If true, this would mean its energy per baryon is lower than that of $^{56}\\text{Fe}$, which is approximately $E_{\\text{Fe}}/A$. The stability of atomic nuclei would then be a result of their being in a metastable state.\n\nA simplified description of SQM is provided by the MIT Bag Model. In this model, quarks are treated as a degenerate Fermi gas confined within a \"bag\" of finite volume. The bag is characterized by a constant energy density $B$, which represents the non-perturbative vacuum energy of QCD that is expelled from the volume occupied by the quarks.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nWithin a simplified version of the MIT Bag Model, the energy per baryon, $E/A$, of three-flavor (u, d, s) strange quark matter is given as a function of the baryon number density $n_B$ by the following approximate expression:\n$$\n\\frac{E(n_B)}{A} = K_1 n_B^{1/3} + K_2 n_B^{-1} + K_3 n_B^{-1/3}\n$$\nThe term proportional to $K_1$ represents the kinetic energy of the quarks (dominated by the massless u and d quarks). The term $K_2=B$ is the bag energy density. The term proportional to $K_3$ represents the leading-order correction due to the non-zero mass $m_s$ of the strange quark. All constants ($K_1, K_2, K_3$) are positive.\n\nThe parameters of this specific model are given in terms of a characteristic energy scale $E_0$ and length scale $L_0$:\n- $K_1 = c_1 E_0 L_0$\n- $K_2 = c_2 E_0 L_0^{-3}$\n- $K_3 = c_3 E_0 L_0^{-1}$\n\nwith the numerical coefficients $c_1=1$, $c_2=2$, and $c_3=1$.\n\nThe energy per baryon of $^{56}\\text{Fe}$ is taken to be $E_{\\text{Fe}}/A = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}}E_0$.\n\nDetermine if strange quark matter is the absolute ground state of matter for this set of parameters. To do this, you must first find the minimum energy per baryon of SQM, $(E/A)_{\\text{min}}$, by minimizing $E(n_B)/A$ with respect to the baryon density $n_B$. Then, compare this value to $E_{\\text{Fe}}/A$.\n\nIf $(E/A)_{\\text{min}}  E_{\\text{Fe}}/A$, the statement is true (output 1). Otherwise, it is false (output 0).", "solution": "To determine if strange quark matter (SQM) is the absolute ground state of matter, we must find the minimum energy per baryon, $\\left(\\frac{E}{A}\\right)_{\\text{min}}$, and compare it to the energy per baryon of $^{56}\\text{Fe}$, given as $\\frac{E_{\\text{Fe}}}{A} = \\frac{5}{\\sqrt{3}} E_0$.\n\nThe energy per baryon is:\n$$\n\\frac{E(n_B)}{A} = K_1 n_B^{1/3} + K_2 n_B^{-1} + K_3 n_B^{-1/3}\n$$\nwith parameters:\n$$\nK_1 = c_1 E_0 L_0 = E_0 L_0, \\quad K_2 = c_2 E_0 L_0^{-3} = 2 E_0 L_0^{-3}, \\quad K_3 = c_3 E_0 L_0^{-1} = E_0 L_0^{-1}\n$$\nand coefficients $c_1 = 1$, $c_2 = 2$, $c_3 = 1$.\n\nTo find the minimum, we take the derivative of $\\frac{E(n_B)}{A}$ with respect to $n_B$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dn_B} \\left( K_1 n_B^{1/3} + K_2 n_B^{-1} + K_3 n_B^{-1/3} \\right) = \\frac{1}{3} K_1 n_B^{-2/3} - K_2 n_B^{-2} - \\frac{1}{3} K_3 n_B^{-4/3} = 0\n$$\nTo solve for $n_B$, let's first multiply by $3n_B^2$ to clear the negative and fractional exponents:\n$$\nK_1 n_B^{4/3} - 3K_2 - K_3 n_B^{2/3} = 0\n$$\nNow, let $y = n_B^{2/3}$. Substituting this into the equation gives a standard quadratic form:\n$$\nK_1 y^2 - K_3 y - 3 K_2 = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $y$ using the quadratic formula.
