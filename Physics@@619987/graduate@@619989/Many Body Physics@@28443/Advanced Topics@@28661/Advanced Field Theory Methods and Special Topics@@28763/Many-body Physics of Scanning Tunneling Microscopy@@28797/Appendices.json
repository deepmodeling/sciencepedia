In this exercise, you will explore how many-body interactions, which limit a quasiparticle's lifetime, manifest in Fourier-transformed STM data.

This practice provides a quantitative understanding of how STM can be used to measure fundamental scattering rates in a material.", "problem": "In a scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiment on a two-dimensional metallic surface, impurities scatter the electronic quasiparticles. The interference between the incident and scattered quasiparticle waves creates spatial modulations in the local density of states (LDOS), $\\rho(\\mathbf{r}, E)$, known as quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns. The Fourier transform of the real-space LDOS map, denoted $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{q}, E)$, exhibits peaks at wavevectors $\\mathbf{q}$ that correspond to scattering between quasiparticle states on the constant energy contour (CEC) for a given energy $E$.\n\nConsider a simple model system with a parabolic dispersion relation $E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2 / (2m^*)$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the 2D wavevector and $m^*$ is the effective mass. The quasiparticles at energy $E$ lie on a circular CEC of radius $k_E = \\sqrt{2m^*E}/\\hbar$. The group velocity of these quasiparticles is $v_E = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} |\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E(\\mathbf{k})| = \\hbar k_E/m^*$.\n\nMany-body interactions cause the quasiparticles to have a finite lifetime $\\tau$. This gives rise to an energy uncertainty characterized by a width (Half-Width at Half-Maximum) $\\Gamma = \\hbar/(2\\tau)$. Consequently, the quasiparticle states are not perfectly sharp in momentum space. For a fixed energy $E$, the probability distribution of the quasiparticle momentum magnitude $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$ around $k_E$ can be modeled as a Lorentzian function of $k$.\n\nThe QPI signal $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{q}, E)$ is proportional to the autoconvolution of the spectral function on the CEC. For scattering between two states $|\\mathbf{k_1}\\rangle$ and $|\\mathbf{k_2}\\rangle$, the resulting interference pattern has wavevector $\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{k_2}-\\mathbf{k_1}$. The intensity of the QPI peak at $\\mathbf{q}$ is determined by the joint density of states available for scattering.\n\nConsider the QPI peak corresponding to elastic backscattering, where $\\mathbf{k_2} \\approx -\\mathbf{k_1}$. The peak in $\\tilde{\\rho}(\\mathbf{q}, E)$ is centered at a wavevector $\\mathbf{q}_0$ with magnitude $|\\mathbf{q}_0| = 2k_E$. Due to the finite momentum width of the quasiparticles, this QPI peak has a finite width. Assuming the QPI peak profile along the direction of $\\mathbf{q}_0$ is determined by the convolution of the momentum distributions of the initial and final quasiparticle states, calculate the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of this backscattering QPI peak, $\\Delta q_{FWHM}$.\n\nExpress your answer in terms of the quasiparticle lifetime $\\tau$ and velocity $v_E$.", "solution": "The solution proceeds in three steps:\n1. Determine the FWHM of a single quasiparticle's momentum distribution, $\\Delta k_{QP}$.\n2. Model the QPI backscattering peak as a convolution of the initial and final state momentum distributions.\n3. Calculate the FWHM of the resulting convolved profile, which gives $\\Delta q_{FWHM}$.\n\n**Step 1: FWHM of the quasiparticle momentum distribution**\n\nThe broadening of a quasiparticle state in energy is given by the HWHM $\\Gamma = \\hbar/(2\\tau)$. The energy distribution follows a Lorentzian (or Cauchy) distribution, described by the spectral function $A(E_k, E) \\propto \\frac{\\Gamma}{(E-E_k)^2 + \\Gamma^2}$, where $E_k$ is the energy of the state with momentum $\\mathbf{k}$.\n\nTo find the momentum broadening at a fixed energy $E$, we analyze the spectral function as a function of momentum. We linearize the dispersion relation $E_k$ around $k_E$, the momentum corresponding to energy $E$:\n$$ E - E_k \\approx \\left. \\frac{dE}{dk'} \\right|_{k'=k_E} (k_E-k) = \\hbar v_E (k_E - k) $$\nSubstituting this into the spectral function expression:\n$$ A(k, E) \\propto \\frac{\\Gamma}{(\\hbar v_E (k_E - k))^2 + \\Gamma^2} = \\frac{\\Gamma/(\\hbar v_E)^2}{(k-k_E)^2 + (\\Gamma/(\\hbar v_E))^2} $$\nThis shows that for a fixed energy $E$, the momentum magnitude distribution is a Lorentzian centered at $k_E$. The form of a Lorentzian centered at $x_0$ with HWHM $w$ is $\\frac{w}{(x-x_0)^2+w^2}$.\nBy comparison, the HWHM of the momentum distribution is:\n$$ a_k = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\hbar v_E} $$\nThe FWHM of this distribution, which we denote as $\\Delta k_{QP}$, is twice the HWHM:\n$$ \\Delta k_{QP} = 2a_k = \\frac{2\\Gamma}{\\hbar v_E} $$\nSubstituting the given expression for $\\Gamma = \\hbar/(2\\tau)$:\n$$ \\Delta k_{QP} = \\frac{2}{\\hbar v_E} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{1}{v_E \\tau} $$\n\n**Step 2: QPI peak profile as a convolution**\n\nThe problem states that the QPI peak profile is determined by the convolution of the momentum distributions of the initial and final states. Let's consider the 1D profile of the distributions along the backscattering direction.\nLet the initial state be centered at $k_E$ and the final state at $-k_E$.\nThe initial state momentum distribution is a Lorentzian centered at $k_E$ with FWHM $\\Delta k_{QP}$:\n$$ P_{initial}(k) = C \\frac{(\\Delta k_{QP}/2)^2}{(k-k_E)^2 + (\\Delta k_{QP}/2)^2} = L(k-k_E; \\Delta k_{QP}) $$\nwhere $C$ is a normalization constant and $L(x; w)$ denotes a Lorentzian centered at $0$ with FWHM $w$.\nThe final state momentum distribution is centered at $-k_E$ with the same FWHM:\n$$ P_{final}(k) = L(k+k_E; \\Delta k_{QP}) $$\nThe scattering vector is $q = k_{final} - k_{initial}$. The probability distribution for $q$, $P_{QPI}(q)$, is given by the convolution of the final state distribution with the time-reversed (or inverted) initial state distribution. More directly, it can be computed as:\n$$ P_{QPI}(q) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P_{initial}(k) P_{final}(q+k) dk $$\nSubstituting the Lorentzian forms:\n$$ P_{QPI}(q) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} L(k-k_E; \\Delta k_{QP}) L(q+k+k_E; \\Delta k_{QP}) dk $$\nLet's make a change of variables $u = k-k_E$, so $k=u+k_E$.\n$$ P_{QPI}(q) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} L(u; \\Delta k_{QP}) L(q+u+2k_E; \\Delta k_{QP}) du $$\nWe recognize this as a convolution. Let $f(x) = L(x; \\Delta k_{QP})$. Then the integral is:\n$$ P_{QPI}(q) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(u) f(q+2k_E - (-u)) du $$\nSince the Lorentzian function is even, $f(-u)=f(u)$. The above is equivalent to the convolution $(f \\star f)$ evaluated at $q+2k_E$:\n$$ P_{QPI}(q) = (f \\star f)(q+2k_E) $$\nThe peak is centered at $q = -2k_E$, which is consistent with backscattering ($k_{final} \\approx -k_{initial}$, so $q \\approx -k_E - k_E = -2k_E$).\n\n**Step 3: FWHM of the convolved profile**\n\nA key property of the Lorentzian distribution is that the convolution of two Lorentzians is another Lorentzian. If $L_1(x)$ has FWHM $w_1$ and $L_2(x)$ has FWHM $w_2$, their convolution $(L_1 \\star L_2)(x)$ is a Lorentzian with FWHM $w_1+w_2$.\nIn our case, we are convolving a Lorentzian $f(k)=L(k; \\Delta k_{QP})$ with itself. The resulting function $(f \\star f)(k)$ is a Lorentzian with FWHM equal to the sum of the individual FWHMs:\n$$ \\text{FWHM of } (f \\star f) = \\Delta k_{QP} + \\Delta k_{QP} = 2\\Delta k_{QP} $$\nThe function $P_{QPI}(q)$ is just a shifted version of $(f \\star f)(q)$, so it has the same width. Therefore, the FWHM of the QPI peak is:\n$$ \\Delta q_{FWHM} = 2 \\Delta k_{QP} $$\nSubstituting the result from Step 1, $\\Delta k_{QP} = 1/(v_E \\tau)$:\n$$ \\Delta q_{FWHM} = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{v_E \\tau} \\right) = \\frac{2}{v_E \\tau} $$\nThe FWHM of the backscattering QPI peak in reciprocal space is inversely proportional to the quasiparticle mean free path $l=v_E\\tau$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{2}{v_E \\tau}} $$", "id": "1168781"}, {"introduction": "The Kondo effect, a hallmark of many-body physics, describes the intricate screening of a local magnetic moment by a sea of conduction electrons, leading to a characteristic resonance in the local density of states at the Fermi energy.
