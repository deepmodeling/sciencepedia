A duality relates the behavior of a system at strong coupling (low temperature) to another at weak coupling (high temperature), providing a powerful, non-perturbative window into its phase structure. This final practice [@problem_id:436643] leverages the remarkable self-duality of the Discrete Gaussian Solid-on-Solid (DGSOS) model to pinpoint the roughening transition. You will see how this symmetry dictates that the model must be critical at the self-dual point, allowing for the exact determination of the roughening transition coupling $K_R$ without resorting to complex calculations.", "problem": "The discrete Gaussian solid-on-solid (DGSOS) model is a statistical mechanics model for a crystal surface or an interface. On a two-dimensional square lattice, a height variable $h_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is assigned to each site $i$. The energy of a configuration $\\{h_i\\}$ is given by the Hamiltonian:\n$$H = \\frac{J}{2} \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} (h_i - h_j)^2$$\nwhere the sum is over all nearest-neighbor pairs of sites, and $J$ is a positive coupling constant. The statistical properties of the model are governed by the dimensionless coupling parameter $K = J/(k_B T)$, where $T$ is the temperature and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThis model exhibits a roughening transition at a critical value of the coupling, $K_R$.\n- For $K > K_R$ (low temperatures), the surface is in a **smooth phase**. In this phase, the correlation length is finite, which is equivalent to the system's transfer matrix having a non-zero spectral gap between its largest and second-largest eigenvalues. This gap is known as the mass gap, $m(K) > 0$. Furthermore, the energy cost per unit length to create a macroscopic step on the surface, known as the string tension $\\sigma(K)$, is also non-zero.\n- For $K \\le K_R$ (high temperatures), the surface is in a **rough phase**. In this phase, height fluctuations diverge, the correlation length is infinite, and thus the mass gap vanishes, $m(K) = 0$. The string tension also vanishes, $\\sigma(K)=0$.\n\nThe DGSOS model possesses a powerful self-duality. Two key consequences of this duality are given as follows:\n1.  The DGSOS model with coupling $K$ is dual to another DGSOS model with coupling $K' = (2\\pi)^2/K$. This means that the physics of the model at coupling $K$ is deeply related to the physics of the same model at coupling $K'$.\n2.  The elementary excitations of the model and its dual are related. Specifically, the mass gap of the model at coupling $K$ is directly proportional to the string tension of the dual model at coupling $K'$:\n    $$m(K) = C \\cdot \\sigma(K')$$\n    where $C$ is a positive constant of proportionality.\n\nUsing only the information provided, determine the exact value of the coupling $K_R$ at the roughening transition.", "solution": "The roughening transition occurs at the critical coupling $K_R$ where the model transitions between smooth and rough phases. The self-duality of the DGSOS model provides a key relation: the coupling $K$ is dual to $K' = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{K}$. At the critical point $K_R$, the physics must be invariant under this duality, implying $K_R = K'$.  \n\nSet $K_R = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{K_R}$:  \n$$K_R^2 = (2\\pi)^2$$  \nSolving for $K_R$ (noting $K > 0$):  \n$$K_R = 2\\pi$$  \n\nThis result is consistent with the phase behavior. For $K > K_R$, the model is in the smooth phase ($m(K) > 0$, $\\sigma(K) > 0$), while for $K \\leq K_R$, it is in the rough phase ($m(K) = 0$, $\\sigma(K) = 0$). The duality relation $m(K) = C \\cdot \\sigma(K')$ ensures that the mass gap of the model at $K$ corresponds to the string tension of the dual model at $K'$. At $K = K_R$, the self-dual point, both phases meet, and the vanishing of $m(K_R)$ and $\\sigma(K_R)$ aligns with the critical behavior. Thus, the roughening transition occurs precisely at the self-dual coupling.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2\\pi}$$", "id": "436643"}]}
