The provided information is self-consistent.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard, well-posed problem in theoretical condensed matter physics. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows. First, we transform the real-space Hamiltonian into momentum space using Bloch's theorem. The Hamiltonian acts on a two-component spinor $(\\psi_A(\\mathbf{k}), \\psi_B(\\mathbf{k}))^T$ representing the amplitudes on the two sublattices. In this basis, the Bloch Hamiltonian $H(\\mathbf{k})$ is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix. The diagonal elements correspond to the on-site energies, which are $+\\Delta$ for sublattice $A$ and $-\\Delta$ for sublattice $B$. The off-diagonal elements are determined by the hopping term.\n\nThe matrix element $H_{AB}(\\mathbf{k})$ is given by the Fourier transform of the hopping connections. Let us denote this function by $\\gamma(\\mathbf{k})$. It is defined as\n$$\n\\gamma(\\mathbf{k}) = -t \\sum_{l=1}^{3} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_l}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_l$ are the three nearest-neighbor vectors connecting a site on sublattice $A$ to its neighbors on sublattice $B$. The element $H_{BA}(\\mathbf{k})$ is the complex conjugate, $\\gamma^{*}(\\mathbf{k})$. The full Bloch Hamiltonian is thus:\n$$\nH(\\mathbf{k}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta & \\gamma(\\mathbf{k}) \\\\ \\gamma^{*}(\\mathbf{k}) & -\\Delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis can be expressed using the Pauli matrices $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = (\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z)$:\n$$\nH(\\mathbf{k}) = \\text{Re}[\\gamma(\\mathbf{k})] \\sigma_x - \\text{Im}[\\gamma(\\mathbf{k})] \\sigma_y + \\Delta \\sigma_z\n$$\nThe low-energy physics of graphene is concentrated around the two inequivalent corners of the Brillouin zone, the Dirac points $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{K'}$, where the band gap of pristine graphene ($\\Delta=0$) closes. At these points, the off-diagonal term vanishes, i.e., $\\gamma(\\mathbf{K}) = \\gamma(\\mathbf{K'}) = 0$.\n\nWe are instructed to expand the Hamiltonian around one such valley, for instance, the $\\mathbf{K}$ point. We write $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{K} + \\mathbf{q}$, where $|\\mathbf{q}| \\ll |\\mathbf{K}|$. We expand $\\gamma(\\mathbf{k})$ to first order in $\\mathbf{q}$:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\mathbf{K} + \\mathbf{q}) \\approx \\gamma(\\mathbf{K}) + \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\gamma(\\mathbf{k})|_{\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{K}}\n$$\nSince $\\gamma(\\mathbf{K}) = 0$, the expansion is dominated by the linear term. The gradient $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} \\gamma(\\mathbf{k})|_{\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{K}}$ is a constant complex vector. The proper evaluation of this gradient, which depends on the specific choice of lattice vectors and coordinates, shows that near a Dirac point, the function $\\gamma(\\mathbf{q})$ takes a linear, chiral form. By an appropriate choice of the coordinate system for $\\mathbf{q}=(q_x, q_y)$ and the specific valley, this can be written as:\n$$\n\\gamma(\\mathbf{q}) \\equiv \\gamma(\\mathbf{K} + \\mathbf{q}) \\approx \\hbar v_{F} (q_x - i q_y)\n$$\nHere, $v_{F}$ is the Fermi velocity, defined from the slope of the dispersion of pristine graphene, $v_F = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} |\\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}} E(\\mathbf{k})|_{\\Delta=0, \\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{K}}$. This definition is consistent with our linearization, as for $\\Delta=0$, $E(\\mathbf{q}) = \\pm |\\gamma(\\mathbf{q})| = \\pm \\hbar v_F |\\mathbf{q}|$. For the other valley $\\mathbf{K'}$, the corresponding term would be $\\hbar v_{F} (q_x + i q_y)$. The choice does not affect the final result for the mass.\n\nSubstituting the linearized off-diagonal term into the Hamiltonian matrix, we obtain the low-energy effective Hamiltonian for a single valley:\n$$\nH(\\mathbf{q}) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta & \\hbar v_{F} (q_x - i q_y) \\\\ \\hbar v_{F} (q_x + i q_y) & -\\Delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nExpressing this in terms of Pauli matrices gives the Hamiltonian for massive Dirac fermions in two dimensions:\n$$\nH(\\mathbf{q}) = (\\hbar v_{F} q_x) \\sigma_x + (\\hbar v_{F} q_y) \\sigma_y + \\Delta \\sigma_z\n$$\nThe energy eigenvalues $E(\\mathbf{q})$ are found by diagonalizing this matrix. The eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian of the form $H = \\mathbf{d} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ are given by $E = \\pm |\\mathbf{d}|$. In our case, the vector $\\mathbf{d}$ is $(\\hbar v_{F} q_x, \\hbar v_{F} q_y, \\Delta)$. The magnitude of this vector is:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{d}| = \\sqrt{(\\hbar v_{F} q_x)^2 + (\\hbar v_{F} q_y)^2 + \\Delta^2} = \\sqrt{(\\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}|)^2 + \\Delta^2}\n$$\nThus, the energy dispersion for the conduction ($+$) and valence ($-$) bands is:\n$$\nE(\\mathbf{q}) = \\pm \\sqrt{(\\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}|)^2 + \\Delta^2}\n$$\nAt the center of the valley, $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{0}$, the energy is $E(\\mathbf{0}) = \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta^2} = \\pm \\Delta$. The energy difference between the bottom of the conduction band ($+\\Delta$) and the top of the valence band ($-\\Delta$) is $2\\Delta$. This is the spectral gap opened by the staggered sublattice potential.\n\nThe final step is to compare our result with the provided relativistic energy-momentum relation:\n$$\nE^{2}(\\mathbf{q}) = (\\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}|)^{2} + (m^{\\star} v_{F}^{2})^{2}\n$$\nSquaring our derived dispersion relation, we get:\n$$\nE^{2}(\\mathbf{q}) = \\left( \\sqrt{(\\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}|)^2 + \\Delta^2} \\right)^2 = (\\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}|)^{2} + \\Delta^2\n$$\nBy direct comparison of the two expressions for $E^{2}(\\mathbf{q})$, we can identify the mass term. The kinetic terms $(\\hbar v_{F} |\\mathbf{q}|)^{2}$ are identical. Equating the remaining terms yields:\n$$\n(m^{\\star} v_{F}^{2})^{2} = \\Delta^2\n$$\nTaking the square root and assuming both $m^{\\star}$ and $\\Delta$ are positive quantities, we find:\n$$\nm^{\\star} v_{F}^{2} = \\Delta\n$$\nSolving for the effective mass $m^{\\star}$, we arrive at the final expression.\n$$\nm^{\\star} = \\frac{\\Delta}{v_{F}^{2}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the staggered potential $\\Delta$ directly generates an effective mass for the otherwise massless Dirac fermions in graphene.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\Delta}{v_{F}^{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2802209"}, {"introduction": "The interaction between graphene's chiral charge carriers and a superconductor gives rise to remarkable phenomena.
