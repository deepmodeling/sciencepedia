Even before considering complex many-body effects, the spectra from individual atoms reveal features determined by fundamental quantum mechanics. This first practice explores the intensity ratio of spin-orbit split core-level peaks, a classic example of how spectral intensities directly reflect the degeneracy of the initial electronic states [@problem_id:1168748]. Mastering this simple rule provides a crucial baseline for identifying deviations caused by more intricate interactions.", "problem": "In X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), a core-level electron is ejected from an atom by absorbing a high-energy photon. Due to spin-orbit interaction, a core level with orbital angular momentum quantum number $l>0$ splits into two levels characterized by the total angular momentum quantum number $j$. For an electron in a $p$-orbital (so $l=1$), these levels are conventionally labeled $p_{3/2}$ and $p_{1/2}$.\n\nConsider a photoemission experiment on an atom with a filled $p$ core-level. The experiment uses unpolarized incident X-ray radiation. The intensity of a photoemission peak corresponding to a specific final state (a hole in the $p_{3/2}$ or $p_{1/2}$ level) is proportional to the total transition rate from that initial level configuration.\n\nAssuming that the transition can be described within the electric dipole approximation and that final-state effects (e.g., interaction of the photoelectron with the created core hole) can be neglected, the total intensity for each peak is found by summing over all allowed final electron states and averaging over all initial degenerate sublevels.\n\nCalculate the theoretical intensity ratio $I(p_{3/2}) / I(p_{1/2})$ of the two spin-orbit split photoemission peaks.", "solution": "The intensity of a photoemission peak is proportional to the total transition rate from the initial core level, considering the core level is filled. For a $p$-orbital ($l=1$), the spin-orbit split levels are $p_{3/2}$ ($j=3/2$) and $p_{1/2}$ ($j=1/2$). The degeneracy of each level is given by $2j+1$. Thus, the $p_{3/2}$ level has $2 \\times (3/2) + 1 = 4$ degenerate states, and the $p_{1/2}$ level has $2 \\times (1/2) + 1 = 2$ degenerate states.\n\nThe total intensity $I(j)$ for a peak is proportional to the number of electrons in the initial level and the transition rate per electron. Since the core level is filled, the number of electrons in $p_{3/2}$ is 4, and in $p_{1/2}$ is 2.\n\nUnder the electric dipole approximation and neglecting final-state effects, the transition rate per electron is the same for both $j$ levels. This is because:\n- The radial matrix elements are identical for both levels, as spin-orbit coupling does not affect the radial wave functions in this approximation.\n- After averaging over polarizations of the unpolarized radiation, summing over final states, and averaging over initial degenerate sublevels, the angular part yields the same transition probability per electron for both $j$ values.\n\nTherefore, the intensity ratio depends only on the number of electrons in each level:\n\n$$\nI(p_{3/2}) \\propto 4, \\quad I(p_{1/2}) \\propto 2.\n$$\n\nThe ratio is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{I(p_{3/2})}{I(p_{1/2})} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2.\n$$\n\nThis result is consistent with the standard intensity ratio for spin-orbit split $p$-levels in XPS.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2} $$", "id": "1168748"}, {"introduction": "While the previous exercise focused on an intrinsic atomic property, the electronic spectra of solids are profoundly shaped by interactions between electrons and the crystal lattice.
