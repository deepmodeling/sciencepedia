This problem explores the rigidity of such a framework.\n\nConsider the projective Hilbert space $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{H})$ of a 3-qubit system, where $\\mathcal{H} = (\\mathbb{C}^2)^{\\otimes 3}$ is the 8-dimensional Hilbert space. The distance between any two states (rays) $|\\psi\\rangle$ and $|\\phi\\rangle$ in this space is given by the Fubini-Study distance, $d_{FS}(|\\psi\\rangle, |\\phi\\rangle) = \\arccos(|\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle|)$, for states normalized to unity.\n\nWe construct a framework consisting of three specific 3-qubit states:\n1.  The product state $|\\psi_1\\rangle = |000\\rangle$.\n2.  The Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state $|\\psi_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|000\\rangle + |111\\rangle)$.\n3.  The W state $|\\psi_3\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|100\\rangle + |010\\rangle + |001\\rangle)$.\n\nIn this framework, the states $|\\psi_1\\rangle$ and $|\\psi_2\\rangle$ are considered \"anchored,\" meaning they are fixed. The state $|\\psi_3\\rangle$ is \"mobile.\" The constraints of the framework are that the Fubini-Study distances $d_{FS}(|\\psi_1\\rangle, |\\psi_3\\rangle)$ and $d_{FS}(|\\psi_2\\rangle, |\\psi_3\\rangle)$ are held constant.\n\nA \"floppy mode\" is a possible infinitesimal continuous motion of the mobile state $|\\psi_3\\rangle$ that preserves these distance constraints to the first order. An infinitesimal motion of $|\\psi_3\\rangle$ can be represented by a vector $|\\delta\\psi_3\\rangle$ that is tangent to the manifold of normalized states at $|\\psi_3\\rangle$, which mathematically means $\\text{Re}(\\langle\\psi_3|\\delta\\psi_3\\rangle) = 0$. For convenience, we can work in the complex tangent space where we enforce the stronger condition $\\langle\\psi_3|\\delta\\psi_3\\rangle = 0$.\n\nDetermine the total number of floppy modes for the mobile state $|\\psi_3\\rangle$. This number corresponds to the real dimension of the vector space of all possible infinitesimal motions $|\\delta\\psi_3\\rangle$ that satisfy the constraints.", "solution": "Let the mobile state be $|\\psi\\rangle \\equiv |\\psi_3\\rangle = |W\\rangle$ and the anchored states be $|\\phi_1\\rangle \\equiv |\\psi_1\\rangle = |000\\rangle$ and $|\\phi_2\\rangle \\equiv |\\psi_2\\rangle = |GHZ\\rangle$. All states are vectors in the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathbb{C}^D$ with $D=2^3=8$.\n\nThe constraints are that the Fubini-Study distances $d_{FS}(|\\phi_1\\rangle, |\\psi\\rangle)$ and $d_{FS}(|\\phi_2\\rangle, |\\psi\\rangle)$ are constant. This is equivalent to keeping the squared overlaps, $C_1 = |\\langle\\phi_1|\\psi\\rangle|^2$ and $C_2 = |\\langle\\phi_2|\\psi\\rangle|^2$, constant.\n\nAn infinitesimal displacement of $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by $|\\psi\\rangle \\to |\\psi\\rangle + |\\delta\\psi\\rangle$. For this to be a valid tangent vector on the sphere of normalized states, we require $|\\delta\\psi\\rangle$ to be orthogonal to $|\\psi\\rangle$, i.e., $\\langle\\psi|\\delta\\psi\\rangle=0$. The space of such complex vectors $|\\delta\\psi\\rangle$ forms a complex vector space of dimension $D-1$. The real dimension of the tangent space is $2(D-1)$.\n\nLet's analyze the first-order change in the constraints. A floppy mode is a displacement $|\\delta\\psi\\rangle$ for which the constants $C_a$ do not change to first order. First, we must calculate the initial overlaps between the mobile state and the anchors:\n$|\\psi\\rangle = |W\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|100\\rangle + |010\\rangle + |001\\rangle)$\n$|\\phi_1\\rangle = |000\\rangle$\n$|\\phi_2\\rangle = |GHZ\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|000\\rangle + |111\\rangle)$\n\nThe overlaps are:\n$$ c_1 = \\langle\\phi_1|\\psi\\rangle = \\langle 000 | \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|100\\rangle + |010\\rangle + |001\\rangle) \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ c_2 = \\langle\\phi_2|\\psi\\rangle = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\langle 000| + \\langle 111|) \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|100\\rangle + |010\\rangle + |001\\rangle) \\right) = 0 $$\nSince both overlaps $c_1$ and $c_2$ are zero, the distance is maximal ($d_{FS}=\\pi/2$), which is a critical point of the distance function. For a generic non-zero overlap, the first-order constraint is $\\text{Re}(\\langle\\psi|\\phi_a\\rangle\\langle\\phi_a|\\delta\\psi\\rangle) = 0$. However, when the overlap is zero, the constraint becomes stronger. The change in the overlap itself is $\\langle\\phi_a|\\psi+\\delta\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\phi_a|\\psi\\rangle + \\langle\\phi_a|\\delta\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\phi_a|\\delta\\psi\\rangle$. To keep the overlap zero to first order, we require $\\langle\\phi_a|\\delta\\psi\\rangle = 0$. This gives a complex linear constraint for each zero overlap.\n\nSo, the vector $|\\delta\\psi\\rangle$ representing a floppy mode must satisfy the following set of complex linear equations:\n1.  $\\langle\\psi|\\delta\\psi\\rangle = 0$ (tangent vector condition)\n2.  $\\langle\\phi_1|\\delta\\psi\\rangle = 0$ (from constraint $C_1=0$)\n3.  $\\langle\\phi_2|\\delta\\psi\\rangle = 0$ (from constraint $C_2=0$)\n\nThis means $|\\delta\\psi\\rangle$ must be in the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by the three vectors $\\{|\\psi\\rangle, |\\phi_1\\rangle, |\\phi_2\\rangle\\}$, which are $\\{|W\\rangle, |000\\rangle, |GHZ\\rangle\\}$.\n\nTo find the dimension of the solution space for $|\\delta\\psi\\rangle$, we first check if the three vectors are linearly independent. Consider a linear combination set to zero:\n$$ a|W\\rangle + b|000\\rangle + c|GHZ\\rangle = 0 $$\nSubstituting the state definitions:\n$$ a\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(|100\\rangle + |010\\rangle + |001\\rangle) + b|000\\rangle + c\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|000\\rangle + |111\\rangle) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}|100\\rangle + \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}|010\\rangle + \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{3}}|001\\rangle + \\left(b + \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)|000\\rangle + \\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2}}|111\\rangle = 0 $$\nThe computational basis states $\\{|000\\rangle, |001\\rangle, |010\\rangle, |100\\rangle, |111\\rangle, \\dots\\}$ are orthogonal. For the sum to be zero, all coefficients must be zero.\nFrom the coefficients of $|100\\rangle, |010\\rangle, |001\\rangle$, we get $a=0$.\nFrom the coefficient of $|111\\rangle$, we get $c=0$.\nFrom the coefficient of $|000\\rangle$, we get $b + c/\\sqrt{2}=0$, which implies $b=0$.\nThus, $a=b=c=0$, and the three vectors are linearly independent.\n\nThese three linearly independent vectors span a 3-dimensional complex subspace of $\\mathcal{H}=\\mathbb{C}^8$. The space of allowed infinitesimal displacements $|\\delta\\psi\\rangle$ is the orthogonal complement of this subspace. The dimension of this orthogonal complement is:\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\text{solution space}) = D - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 $$\nThe number of floppy modes is the real dimension of this complex vector space.

The condition for a floppy mode is that the distance remains 0, which means the evolved states must remain identical: $\\rho'_{12} = \\rho'_{34}$.\nUsing $\\rho_{12} = \\rho_{34} = \\rho_0$, this implies the condition on the generators:\n$$[H_{12}, \\rho_0] = [H_{34}, \\rho_0]$$\nwhere $H_{12} = H_1 \\otimes I + I \\otimes H_2$ and $H_{34} = H_3 \\otimes I + I \\otimes H_4$ are now viewed as operators on the same generic 2-qubit space.\nLet's define an operator $K = H_{12} - H_{34}$.

Both $A, B \\in \\mathfrak{su}(2)$. The operator $K$ is $K = A \\otimes I + I \\otimes B$.
