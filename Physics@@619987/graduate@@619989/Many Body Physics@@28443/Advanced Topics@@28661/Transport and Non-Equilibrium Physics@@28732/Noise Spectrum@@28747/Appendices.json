We will examine the current noise in a Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquid, a strongly correlated electronic state hosting emergent quasiparticles with fractional charge. While the average current measurement (conductance) is quantized, it does not directly reveal the charge of these carriers. This exercise will guide you through the calculation of current cross-correlations, demonstrating how such a measurement can provide unambiguous evidence for the fractional charge of the elementary excitations [@problem_id:1174696], a direct signature of the system's underlying topological order.", "problem": "In a two-dimensional electron gas at very low temperatures and in a strong perpendicular magnetic field, electrons can form strongly-correlated states known as fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. These states are characterized by a filling factor $\\nu$, the ratio of electrons to magnetic flux quanta. The low-energy charge carriers in FQH states are not electrons, but emergent quasiparticles with fractional elementary charge $e^*$.\n\nOne way to probe this fractional charge is through shot noise measurements. Consider a T-junction geometry etched into a system hosting an FQH fluid with filling factor $\\nu = 2/5$. A DC voltage bias $V$ is applied to a source terminal (S), driving a current along a chiral edge state. This edge state is then split at the junction into two paths, leading to two separate drain terminals (D1 and D2), which are both held at ground potential. The entire system is at zero temperature ($T=0$).\n\nThe partitioning of the charge carriers at the junction generates fluctuations in the currents $I_1(t)$ and $I_2(t)$ measured at the drains.
