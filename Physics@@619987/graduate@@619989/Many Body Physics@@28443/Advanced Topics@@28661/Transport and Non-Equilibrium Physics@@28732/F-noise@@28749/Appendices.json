The integrated series $y_k$ is divided into non-overlapping segments of equal length $s$.\n3.  In each segment, a linear trend, $y_{fit,s}(k)$, is estimated by a least-squares fit.\n4.  The variance of the residuals (the detrended fluctuations) is calculated over all segments of size $s$. The root-mean-square fluctuation, $F(s)$, is given by the square root of this variance.\n5.
