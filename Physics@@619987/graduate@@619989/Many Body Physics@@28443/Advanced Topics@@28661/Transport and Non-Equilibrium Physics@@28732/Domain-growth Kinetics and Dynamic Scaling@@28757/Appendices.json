This practice challenges you to adapt the classic LSW framework to a scenario where solute transport is dominated by an external drift field, rather than by diffusion, and to derive the modified growth exponent [@problem_id:1125569].", "problem": "**Problem: Modified Growth Law for Ostwald Ripening with Solute Drift**\n\n**Background:**\nOstwald ripening is a coarsening process observed in solid or liquid solutions where, over time, smaller crystals or sol particles dissolve and redeposit onto larger ones. This phenomenon is driven by the minimization of the total interfacial free energy of the system. The chemical potential, and thus the equilibrium solute concentration, at the surface of a curved interface is higher than that of a flat interface. For a spherical particle of radius $R$, the equilibrium solute concentration $c(R)$ at its surface is described by the Gibbs-Thomson relation:\n$$\nc(R) = c_{\\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{d_0}{R}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $c_{\\infty}$ is the equilibrium concentration for a flat interface ($R \\to \\infty$) and $d_0$ is a material-specific parameter known as the capillary length.\n\nIn the mean-field theory of Lifshitz, Slyozov, and Wagner (LSW), the evolution of the particle size distribution is analyzed by considering the particles to be embedded in a medium with a uniform average solute concentration, $c_{\\text{avg}}(t)$. This average concentration is assumed to be in equilibrium with particles of a time-dependent critical radius, $R_c(t)$, such that $c_{\\text{avg}}(t) = c(R_c(t))$. Consequently, particles with $R > R_c$ grow, while those with $R  R_c$ shrink. The concentration difference driving the growth or shrinkage of a particle of radius $R$ is thus proportional to $(c_{\\text{avg}} - c(R)) \\propto \\left(\\frac{1}{R_c} - \\frac{1}{R}\\right)$.\n\nThe growth rate of a particle's volume, $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\\pi R^2 \\frac{dR}{dt}$, is directly proportional to the total flux of solute, $J(R)$, to its surface.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider an Ostwald ripening process where the transport of solute particles in the surrounding medium is governed not only by diffusion (coefficient $D$) but also by a constant external drift field, which imparts a uniform drift velocity $v$ to the solute particles. We are interested in the late-time, drift-dominated regime, where the PÃ©clet number $Pe = vR/D \\gg 1$ for a typical particle of radius $R$. In this limit, the total flux of solute to a spherical particle of radius $R$ is given by:\n$$\nJ(R) = C \\, v^{1/3} D^{2/3} R^{4/3} (c_{\\text{avg}} - c(R))\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant.\n\nAssume that the system reaches a self-similar scaling state where the average particle radius, $\\langle R(t) \\rangle$, grows with time $t$ according to a power law:\n$$\n\\langle R(t) \\rangle \\propto t^\\alpha\n$$\nAssuming that the critical radius $R_c(t)$ scales in the same manner as the average radius, determine the value of the growth exponent $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The growth rate of a particle's radius is derived from the given solute flux and the volume change. The flux is:\n$$\nJ(R) = C v^{1/3} D^{2/3} R^{4/3} (c_{\\text{avg}} - c(R))\n$$\nThe volume $V$ of a spherical particle is $V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3$, so its rate of change is:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = 4\\pi R^2 \\frac{dR}{dt}\n$$\nThis rate is proportional to the flux $J(R)$, with a constant $\\Omega$ (molar volume) accounting for conversion factors:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\Omega J(R)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $J(R)$:\n$$\n4\\pi R^2 \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\Omega C v^{1/3} D^{2/3} R^{4/3} (c_{\\text{avg}} - c(R))\n$$\nSolving for $\\frac{dR}{dt}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{\\Omega C v^{1/3} D^{2/3}}{4\\pi} R^{4/3 - 2} (c_{\\text{avg}} - c(R)) = \\frac{\\Omega C v^{1/3} D^{2/3}}{4\\pi} R^{-2/3} (c_{\\text{avg}} - c(R))\n$$\nThe Gibbs-Thomson relation gives $c(R) = c_{\\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{d_0}{R}\\right)$, and the mean-field assumption gives $c_{\\text{avg}} = c(R_c) = c_{\\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{d_0}{R_c}\\right)$. Thus, the concentration difference is:\n$$\nc_{\\text{avg}} - c(R) = c_{\\infty} d_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{R_c} - \\frac{1}{R} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for the growth rate:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{\\Omega C v^{1/3} D^{2/3} c_{\\infty} d_0}{4\\pi} R^{-2/3} \\left( \\frac{1}{R_c} - \\frac{1}{R} \\right)\n$$\nLet's group the constants into a single parameter $A = \\frac{\\Omega C v^{1/3} D^{2/3} c_{\\infty} d_0}{4\\pi}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = A R^{-2/3} \\left( \\frac{1}{R_c} - \\frac{1}{R} \\right)\n$$\nFor a self-similar scaling state to exist, the functional form of the evolution must be time-invariant under rescaling. We assume $R_c(t) \\propto t^\\alpha$. This implies that a typical radius, $R_c$, grows such that $\\frac{dR_c}{dt} \\propto t^{\\alpha-1} \\propto (R_c^{1/\\alpha})^{\\alpha-1} = R_c^{1-1/\\alpha}$.\n\nThe growth law for a particle near the critical radius (where $R \\approx R_c$) can be approximated. By Taylor expanding the term in the parenthesis $\\left( \\frac{1}{R_c} - \\frac{1}{R} \\right) \\approx \\frac{R-R_c}{R_c^2}$, we see the growth rate depends on the width of the size distribution relative to $R_c$.\nA more robust scaling argument considers the typical growth rate of the critical particle itself. We must have $\\frac{dR_c}{dt}$ scale consistently. From our equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dR_c}{dt} \\sim A R_c^{-2/3} \\left( \\frac{1}{R_c} - \\frac{1}{R_c} \\right) \\implies \\text{this is not helpful.}\n$$\nLet's consider the scaling of the equation itself. $\\frac{dR}{dt}$ must scale like $R_c/t$.\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} \\sim \\frac{R_c}{t} \\propto \\frac{R_c}{R_c^{1/\\alpha}} = R_c^{1-1/\\alpha}\n$$\nThe right-hand side of the growth law scales as:\n$$\nR^{-2/3} \\left( \\frac{1}{R_c} - \\frac{1}{R} \\right) \\sim R_c^{-2/3} \\frac{1}{R_c} = R_c^{-5/3}\n$$\nEquating the exponents of $R_c$ from both sides:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{1}{\\alpha} = -\\frac{5}{3}\n$$\nWait, this isn't right. Let's re-examine the original solution's method.\nLet's follow the formal self-similarity argument again. Introduce scaled radius $\\rho = R/R_c(t)$.\n$\\frac{d}{dt} (\\rho R_c) = \\rho \\frac{dR_c}{dt} + R_c \\frac{d\\rho}{dt}$.\nThis must be equal to $A (\\rho R_c)^{-2/3} (\\frac{1}{R_c} - \\frac{1}{\\rho R_c}) = A \\rho^{-2/3} R_c^{-5/3} \\frac{\\rho-1}{\\rho} = A (\\rho-1)\\rho^{-5/3} R_c^{-5/3}$.\nSo, $R_c \\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = A(\\rho-1)\\rho^{-5/3} R_c^{-5/3} - \\rho\\frac{dR_c}{dt}$.\n$R_c(t) = B t^\\alpha \\implies \\frac{dR_c}{dt} = \\alpha B t^{\\alpha-1} = \\frac{\\alpha R_c}{t}$.\n$R_c \\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = A(\\rho-1)\\rho^{-5/3} R_c^{-5/3} - \\rho \\frac{\\alpha R_c}{t}$.\n$R_c \\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = A(\\rho-1)\\rho^{-5/3} R_c^{-5/3} - \\rho \\alpha R_c (R_c/B)^{-1/\\alpha}$.\nThis is getting complicated. The original solution's approach was cleaner. Let's use it.\nThe condition for self-similarity is that the time dependence can be separated out in the equation for the scaled variable $\\rho$.\n$\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = A \\rho^{-5/3}(\\rho-1) R_c^{-8/3} - \\rho \\frac{1}{R_c}\\frac{dR_c}{dt}$.\nThe time dependence is carried by $R_c$. For the expression to be separable into a function of $\\rho$ and a function of $t$, the time dependence of both terms on the right must be identical.\nLet $R_c \\propto t^\\alpha$. Then $\\frac{dR_c}{dt} \\propto t^{\\alpha-1}$.\nThe time dependence of the first term is $(t^\\alpha)^{-8/3} = t^{-8\\alpha/3}$.\nThe time dependence of the second term is $(t^\\alpha)^{-1} t^{\\alpha-1} = t^{-\\alpha}t^{\\alpha-1} = t^{-1}$.\nEquating the time dependencies:\n$t^{-8\\alpha/3} \\propto t^{-1} \\implies \\frac{8\\alpha}{3} = 1 \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{3}{8}$.\nThe derivation seems to have a small error. Let's recheck the second term.\nTerm 2: $\\rho \\frac{1}{R_c}\\frac{dR_c}{dt}$. The time dependence is in $\\frac{1}{R_c}\\frac{dR_c}{dt} = \\frac{d(\\ln R_c)}{dt}$.\nIf $R_c=Bt^\\alpha$, then $\\ln R_c = \\ln B + \\alpha \\ln t$. So $\\frac{d(\\ln R_c)}{dt} = \\alpha/t$.\nThe time dependence of Term 2 is $t^{-1}$.\nThe time dependence of Term 1 is from $R_c^{-8/3} \\propto (t^\\alpha)^{-8/3} = t^{-8\\alpha/3}$.\nSo, we must have $-8\\alpha/3 = -1$.\n$\\alpha = 3/8$. The original solution's logic was flawed but the final step was correct.\n\nLet's use my first, simpler scaling argument.\n$\\frac{dR}{dt} \\propto R^{-2/3} (\\frac{1}{R_c} - \\frac{1}{R})$. For $R$ of the order $R_c$, this is $\\frac{dR}{dt} \\propto R_c^{-2/3} \\frac{\\Delta R}{R_c^2}$. The width $\\Delta R$ also scales with $R_c$. So $\\frac{dR}{dt} \\propto R_c^{-2/3} \\frac{R_c}{R_c^2} = R_c^{-5/3}$.\nAlso $\\frac{dR_c}{dt} \\propto R_c^{1-1/\\alpha}$.\nEquating exponents: $1 - 1/\\alpha = -5/3 \\implies 1/\\alpha = 1 + 5/3 = 8/3 \\implies \\alpha = 3/8$. This is correct and much simpler. I will adopt this reasoning.\n\nThe growth rate of a characteristic particle of radius $R \\sim R_c(t)$ is $\\frac{dR_c}{dt}$.\nThe right hand side of the growth law, for $R \\sim R_c$, scales as $R_c^{-2/3} \\frac{1}{R_c} = R_c^{-5/3}$. So we have the scaling relation:\n$$ \\frac{dR_c}{dt} \\propto R_c^{-5/3} $$\nThis is a simple differential equation. We can separate variables and integrate:\n$$ R_c^{5/3} dR_c \\propto dt $$\n$$ \\int R_c^{5/3} dR_c \\propto \\int dt $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{8} R_c^{8/3} \\propto t $$\n$$ R_c^{8/3} \\propto t \\implies R_c(t) \\propto t^{3/8} $$\nThus, the growth exponent is $\\alpha = 3/8$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{8}} $$", "id": "1125569"}, {"introduction": "A central concept in coarsening is dynamic scaling, which posits that the statistical properties of a system become time-invariant when spatial dimensions are rescaled by the characteristic length scale $L(t)$.
