The key to solving this is the semiclassical equation of motion for the electron's crystal momentum $k$.\n\n1.  **Semiclassical Equation of Motion:**\n    In the presence of an external electric field $E$, the force on the electron is $F_{ext} = -eE$. The semiclassical equation of motion relates this external force to the rate of change of the crystal momentum $\\hbar k$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(\\hbar k)}{dt} = F_{ext}\n    $$\n    Substituting the force, we get:\n    $$\n    \\hbar \\frac{dk}{dt} = -eE\n    $$\n    This equation describes how the electron's crystal momentum evolves in time. Note that this equation is independent of the specific form of the energy dispersion $\\epsilon(k)$. The parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$ from the dispersion relation are therefore not relevant for calculating the time evolution of $k$.\n\n2.  **Integrating the Equation of Motion:**\n    Since the electric field $E$ is uniform and static, we can directly integrate the equation of motion with respect to time $t$:\n    $$\n    \\int_{k(0)}^{k(t)} dk' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{eE}{\\hbar} dt'\n    $$\n    This yields:\n    $$\n    k(t) - k(0) = -\\frac{eE}{\\hbar} t\n    $$\n    or\n    $$\n    k(t) = k(0) - \\frac{eE}{\\hbar} t\n    $$\n    This shows that the crystal momentum $k$ changes linearly with time.\n\n3.  **Periodicity in the Brillouin Zone:**\n    The energy dispersion $\\epsilon(k)$, and all other physical properties of the electron, are periodic in the reciprocal lattice. For a 1D lattice with lattice constant $a$, the reciprocal lattice vector has magnitude $2\\pi/a$. This means that crystal momenta $k$ and $k + n(2\\pi/a)$ (where $n$ is an integer) are physically equivalent. The first Brillouin zone (BZ) is a primitive cell of the reciprocal lattice, typically chosen as the interval $[-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$, which has a width of $\\Delta k_{BZ} = 2\\pi/a$.\n\n4.  **Definition of Bloch Oscillation Period:**\n    A Bloch oscillation is completed when the electron's crystal momentum $k(t)$ has swept across the entire Brillouin zone and returned to a point equivalent to its starting point. The period of this oscillation, $T_B$, is the time it takes for the crystal momentum to change by a reciprocal lattice vector, i.e., $|\\Delta k| = |k(T_B) - k(0)| = 2\\pi/a$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Period:**\n    Using the integrated equation of motion for the change in momentum over one period $T_B$:\n    $$\n    |k(T_B) - k(0)| = \\left| -\\frac{eE}{\\hbar} T_B \\right|\n    $$\n    We set this change equal to the width of the Brillouin zone:\n    $$\n    \\frac{eE}{\\hbar} T_B = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\n    $$\n    Solving for the Bloch period $T_B$, we find:\n    $$\n    T_B = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{eEa}\n    $$\n    The hopping parameters $t_1$ and $t_2$ determine the shape of the energy band and thus affect the amplitude and waveform of the electron's real-space oscillation, but they do not influence the period of the oscillation, which is solely determined by the fundamental lattice spacing and the applied field.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{eEa}}\n$$", "id": "1128421"}, {"introduction": "While the period of Bloch oscillations is independent of the band structure's shape, the electron's real-space trajectory is not.
