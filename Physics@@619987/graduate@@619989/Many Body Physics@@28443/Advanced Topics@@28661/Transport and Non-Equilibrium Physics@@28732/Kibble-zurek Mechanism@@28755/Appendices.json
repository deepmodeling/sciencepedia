Consider a system in $d$ spatial dimensions, characterized by a critical point at $\\epsilon=0$, where $\\epsilon$ is a dimensionless control parameter (e.g., reduced temperature $\\epsilon = (T-T_c)/T_c$).\n\nNear the critical point, the system exhibits critical slowing down and divergence of the correlation length. The equilibrium relaxation time $\\tau$ and correlation length $\\xi$ scale with $\\epsilon$ as:\n$$\n\\tau(\\epsilon) = \\tau_0 |\\epsilon|^{-\\nu z}\n$$\n$$\n\\xi(\\epsilon) = \\xi_0 |\\epsilon|^{-\\nu}\n$$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the correlation length critical exponent, $z$ is the dynamical critical exponent, and $\\tau_0, \\xi_0$ are microscopic constants.\n\nThe system is subjected to a linear quench protocol, where the control parameter is varied in time as:\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = \\frac{t}{\\tau_Q}\n$$\nHere, $\\tau_Q$ is the characteristic quench time, with a large $\\tau_Q$ corresponding to a slow quench.

This occurs when the system's internal relaxation time, $\\tau(\\epsilon)$, becomes comparable to the characteristic time scale of the quench.\n\n**1. The Freeze-out Condition**\n\nFar from the critical point (large $|t|$), the quench is slow compared to the system's relaxation time, so the system adapts adiabatically. Close to the critical point (small $|t|$), the relaxation time diverges (\"critical slowing down\"), and the system can no longer keep up with the changing control parameter. The evolution effectively \"freezes.\"\n\nThe transition between these regimes occurs at a \"freeze-out\" time, denoted by $\\pm \\hat{t}$, on either side of the critical point. The KZM postulates that this time is determined by the condition that the system's relaxation time is equal to the time remaining until the critical point is crossed. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\tau(\\epsilon(\\hat{t})) = |\\hat{t}|\n$$\n\n**2. Solving for the Freeze-out Time $\\hat{t}$**\n\nWe substitute the given expressions for the relaxation time $\\tau(\\epsilon)$ and the quench protocol $\\epsilon(t)$ into the freeze-out condition.\nThe relaxation time is $\\tau(\\epsilon) = \\tau_0 |\\epsilon|^{-\\nu z}$.\nThe control parameter at time $\\hat{t}$ is $\\epsilon(\\hat{t}) = \\hat{t}/\\tau_Q$.\n\nThe condition becomes:\n$$\n\\tau_0 \\left| \\frac{\\hat{t}}{\\tau_Q} \\right|^{-\\nu z} = |\\hat{t}|\n$$\nLet's solve this equation for $|\\hat{t}|$. We can ignore the sign of $\\hat{t}$ as we are interested in its magnitude.\n$$\n\\tau_0 \\left( \\frac{\\tau_Q}{|\\hat{t}|} \\right)^{\\nu z} = |\\hat{t}|\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_0 \\tau_Q^{\\nu z} = |\\hat{t}|^{\\nu z} |\\hat{t}|\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_0 \\tau_Q^{\\nu z} = |\\hat{t}|^{1+\\nu z}\n$$\nSolving for $|\\hat{t}|$, we get:\n$$\n|\\hat{t}| = (\\tau_0 \\tau_Q^{\\nu z})^{\\frac{1}{1+\\nu z}}\n$$\nThis shows how the freeze-out time scales with the quench time $\\tau_Q$:\n$$\n|\\hat{t}| \\propto \\tau_Q^{\\frac{\\nu z}{1+\\nu z}}\n$$\n\n**3. Determining the Characteristic Length Scale $\\hat{\\xi}$**\n\nAt the freeze-out time $\\hat{t}$, the system's state is frozen. The correlation length at this instant, $\\hat{\\xi} = \\xi(\\epsilon(\\hat{t}))$, sets the characteristic size of the correlated domains that form. Different domains will independently choose a state in the new broken-symmetry phase, and topological defects (like domain walls, vortices, or monopoles) form at the boundaries between these domains. The average separation between defects will be of the order of $\\hat{\\xi}$.\n\nFirst, we find the value of the control parameter at freeze-out, $\\hat{\\epsilon} = |\\epsilon(\\hat{t})|$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\epsilon} = \\frac{|\\hat{t}|}{\\tau_Q} \\propto \\frac{\\tau_Q^{\\frac{\\nu z}{1+\\nu z}}}{\\tau_Q} = \\tau_Q^{\\frac{\\nu z}{1+\\nu z} - 1} = \\tau_Q^{\\frac{\\nu z - (1+\\nu z)}{1+\\nu z}} = \\tau_Q^{-\\frac{1}{1+\\nu z}}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the correlation length at freeze-out, $\\hat{\\xi}$, using its scaling relation $\\xi \\propto |\\epsilon|^{-\\nu}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\xi} \\propto (\\hat{\\epsilon})^{-\\nu} \\propto \\left( \\tau_Q^{-\\frac{1}{1+\\nu z}} \\right)^{-\\nu}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\xi} \\propto \\tau_Q^{\\frac{\\nu}{1+\\nu z}}\n$$\n\n**4. Calculating the Defect Density $n_d$**\n\nThe density of defects, $n_d$, is the number of defects per unit volume. Since the characteristic separation between defects is $\\hat{\\xi}$, in a $d$-dimensional space, the volume of a single correlated domain is of the order $\\hat{\\xi}^d$. Assuming roughly one defect per such domain, the defect density scales as:\n$$\nn_d \\propto \\frac{1}{\\hat{\\xi}^d} = (\\hat{\\xi})^{-d}\n$$\nSubstituting the scaling for $\\hat{\\xi}$:\n$$\nn_d \\propto \\left( \\tau_Q^{\\frac{\\nu}{1+\\nu z}} \\right)^{-d} = \\tau_Q^{-\\frac{d\\nu}{1+\\nu z}}\n$$\n\n**5. Identifying the Scaling Exponent $\\alpha$**\n\nThe problem states that the defect density scales as $n_d \\propto \\tau_Q^{-\\alpha}$. By comparing this with the result we derived, we can directly identify the exponent $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{d\\nu}{1+\\nu z}\n$$\nThis is the general Kibble-Zurek scaling exponent for the density of defects formed during a linear quench across a continuous phase transition.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{d\\nu}{1+\\nu z}}\n$$", "id": "1157625"}, {"introduction": "Having established the general KZM scaling law, we now apply it to a concrete, experimentally relevant scenario: a quantum quench in the Bose-Hubbard model.
