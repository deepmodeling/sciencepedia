Each such bond has an energy change of $+2J$ compared to the metastable state (where both spins are down, giving bond energy $-J$; now, with opposite spins, bond energy is $+J$, so change is $+2J$).\n2. **External field energy change**: Each flipped spin (from down to up) changes the field energy by $-2h$ (since $-h \\times (+1) - [-h \\times (-1)] = -h - h = -2h$).\n\nFor an $L \\times L$ square nucleus at the corner, with two sides aligned with the lattice edges:\n- The broken bonds occur along the top and right edges of the nucleus (since the left and bottom edges are on the lattice boundary and have no neighbors outside).\n- The top edge has $L$ sites, each with one bond above (to an outside spin).\n- The right edge has $L$ sites, each with one bond to the right (to an outside spin).\n- The corner site $(L, L)$ is included in both counts, correctly accounting for its two broken bonds.\n- Total broken bonds: $L + L = 2L$.\n\nThus, the bond energy change is $2L \\times 2J = 4J L$.  \nThe field energy change is $L^2 \\times (-2h) = -2h L^2$.  \n\nThe total energy cost is:\n\n$$\n\\Delta E(L) = 4J L - 2h L^2\n$$\n\n\nThis is a quadratic function in $L$: $\\Delta E(L) = -2h L^2 + 4J L$.  \nTo find the critical size $L_c$ that maximizes $\\Delta E(L)$, take the derivative and set it to zero:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dL} \\Delta E(L) = -4h L + 4J = 0\n$$\n\nSolving for $L$:\n\n$$\n-4h L + 4J = 0 \\implies L = \\frac{J}{h}\n$$\n\nThus, $L_c = J / h$.  \nSubstitute $L_c$ into $\\Delta E(L)$ to find the energy barrier:\n\n$$\n\\Delta E^* = \\Delta E(L_c) = -2h \\left( \\frac{J}{h} \\right)^2 + 4J \\left( \\frac{J}{h} \\right) = -2h \\cdot \\frac{J^2}{h^2} + 4J \\cdot \\frac{J}{h} = -\\frac{2J^2}{h} + \\frac{4J^2}{h} = \\frac{2J^2}{h}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the activation barrier is $\\Delta E^* = \\frac{2J^2}{h}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\dfrac{2J^{2}}{h}}$$", "id": "1170231"}, {"introduction": "Metastability is not just a theoretical curiosity but a key feature of modern experiments, particularly in the realm of ultracold atoms.
