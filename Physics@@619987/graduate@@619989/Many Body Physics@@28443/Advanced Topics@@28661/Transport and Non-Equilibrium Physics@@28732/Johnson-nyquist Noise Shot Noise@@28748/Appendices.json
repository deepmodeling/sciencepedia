By comparing the magnitudes of Johnson-Nyquist thermal noise and shot noise, you will derive the characteristic voltage scale at which quantum effects from the discreteness of charge become as significant as thermal effects. This exercise provides a crucial first step in developing an intuition for the different physical origins and dependencies of these two primary noise sources, which scale with thermal energy $k_B T$ and elementary charge $e$, respectively [@problem_id:584125].", "problem": "Consider a two-terminal electronic device maintained at a constant temperature $T$. The device exhibits a constant DC electrical resistance $R$. When a DC voltage $V$ is applied across its terminals, a current $I$ flows through it, obeying Ohm's law, $V=IR$. The flow of current and the thermal environment give rise to two primary sources of electrical current noise, which are assumed to be uncorrelated.\n\n1.  **Johnson-Nyquist Noise (Thermal Noise):** This noise is due to the thermal agitation of charge carriers within the device. Its one-sided power spectral density, for frequencies relevant to this problem, is independent of frequency (white noise) and is given by\n    $$S_{I, \\text{th}} = \\frac{4k_B T}{R}$$\n    where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n2.  **Shot Noise:** This noise arises from the discrete nature of the elementary charge $e$.

You will investigate the shot noise in a perfectly transmitting quantum channel, as described by the Landauer-Büttiker formalism where the transmission probability is $T=1$. This exercise reveals that shot noise is fundamentally a partitioning effect, and its suppression in a perfect channel is a hallmark of quantum coherence, challenging our classical intuition about current flow [@problem_id:1156669].", "problem": "A Quantum Point Contact (QPC) is a narrow, a few atoms wide, constriction that connects two large electron reservoirs. The electrical conductance, $G$, of such a device is quantized due to the wave-like nature of electrons. The conductance is given by the Landauer formula:\n$$ G = G_0 \\sum_{n=1}^{N} T_n $$\nwhere $G_0 = 2e^2/h$ is the conductance quantum, $e$ is the elementary charge, $h$ is Planck's constant, and $T_n$ is the transmission probability for the $n$-th available transverse mode (or channel) in the constriction. The values of $T_n$ are between 0 (fully reflected) and 1 (fully transmitted).\n\nWhen a voltage $V$ is applied across a conductor at a finite temperature $T$, there are fluctuations in the electric current, which can be characterized by the low-frequency power spectral density of current noise, $S_I(V,T)$. This noise has two main origins:\n1.  **Thermal Noise (Johnson-Nyquist Noise):** Exists in any conductor at $T0$ due to thermal agitation of charge carriers. It is present even at zero bias voltage, $S_I(V=0,T)$.\n2.  **Shot Noise:** Arises from the discreteness of charge carriers. It is a non-equilibrium phenomenon that appears when a voltage is applied ($V \\neq 0$). The shot noise is rigorously defined as the excess noise above the thermal background:\n    $$ S_\\text{shot}(V,T) = S_I(V,T) - S_I(V=0,T) $$\n\nFor a general multi-channel quantum conductor, the low-frequency shot noise is described by the Landauer-Büttiker formalism, which gives the following expression for the excess noise:\n$$ S_\\text{shot}(V,T) = \\frac{2e^2}{h} \\sum_n T_n(1-T_n) \\left[ |eV|\\coth\\left(\\frac{|eV|}{2k_B T}\\right) - 2k_B T \\right] $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. This formula shows that shot noise is intimately related to the transmission probabilities $T_n$.\n\n**Problem:**\nConsider a QPC that is experimentally adjusted to be on the first conductance plateau.
