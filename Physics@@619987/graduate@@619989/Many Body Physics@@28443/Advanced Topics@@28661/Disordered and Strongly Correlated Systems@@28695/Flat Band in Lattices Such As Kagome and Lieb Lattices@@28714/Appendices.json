This exercise demonstrates how a zero-energy flat band can be rigorously proven to exist in certain bipartite lattices without needing to solve the full dispersion relation. By analyzing a decorated honeycomb lattice, you will see how an imbalance in the number of sites between the two sublattices within a unit cell guarantees the presence of zero-energy states for any momentum, forming a perfectly flat band [@problem_id:1138779]. This technique provides a powerful and intuitive design principle for creating flat-band systems.", "problem": "Consider a tight-binding model on a decorated honeycomb lattice. This lattice is constructed from a standard two-dimensional honeycomb lattice by adding an extra site at the midpoint of each of its bonds. Let the original honeycomb sites be denoted as V-sites (for vertex) and the new sites added at the bond centers be denoted as B-sites (for bond).\n\nThe tight-binding Hamiltonian for this system is given by:\n$$ H = -t \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} (c_i^\\dagger c_j + c_j^\\dagger c_i) $$\nwhere $c_i^\\dagger$ and $c_i$ are the creation and annihilation operators for an electron at site $i$, and the sum runs over all pairs of nearest-neighbor sites $\\langle i,j \\rangle$. The hopping parameter $t$ is a real constant and is uniform for all bonds. All sites, both V and B types, are assumed to have the same on-site energy, which is set to zero.\n\nDetermine the energy of the dispersionless (flat) band in the electronic band structure of this lattice.", "solution": "1.

This problem moves us from the single-particle picture to the Hubbard model on a Kagome lattice, a paradigmatic flat-band system. You will analyze the ground state of two interacting electrons that are confined to a compact localized state (CLS), which is the real-space manifestation of the flat band's destructive interference [@problem_id:1138679]. This practice is a crucial first step in understanding how the quenching of kinetic energy in a flat band allows electron-electron interactions to become the dominant force, leading to exotic correlated phases of matter.", "problem": "Consider a tight-binding model on a Kagome lattice, which is a two-dimensional network of corner-sharing triangles.

The eigenstates of this flat band can be constructed as compact localized states (CLS), which are wavefunctions with non-zero amplitudes only on a small, finite number of sites. For the Kagome lattice, a CLS can be localized on the six sites forming an elementary hexagonal plaquette.\n\nThe problem is to determine the ground state energy of a system of two spin-up electrons, which are constrained to move only on the six lattice sites that support a single such compact localized state.", "solution": "We consider two spin-up electrons on the six sites of a single compact-localized hexagon.

We will investigate whether a strong local repulsion between bosons on a Kagome lattice can lead to the formation of a bound pair state, a phenomenon where repulsion paradoxically induces an effective attraction. By analyzing the two-boson energy spectrum within the flat band, you will determine if a bound state with energy lower than the non-interacting continuum exists [@problem_id:1138699].
