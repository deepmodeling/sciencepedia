We begin by applying the principles of quantum mechanics in a periodic potential.\n\nFor a one-dimensional ring of length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions, the allowed electron wavevectors $k$ are quantized. The wavefunction $\\psi(x)$ must satisfy $\\psi(x+L) = \\psi(x)$. For a plane-wave component of the Bloch function, $\\exp(ikx)$, this implies $\\exp(ikL) = 1$. This condition is met if $kL = 2\\pi n$, where $n$ is an integer.\nThe allowed wavevectors are therefore given by:\n$$k = \\frac{2\\pi n}{L}$$\nGiven that the ring consists of $N$ sites with lattice spacing $a$, the total length is $L=Na$. Substituting this into the expression for $k$ yields:\n$$k = \\frac{2\\pi n}{Na}$$\nThese allowed $k$-values form a uniform grid in reciprocal space. The spacing between consecutive $k$-points is $\\Delta k = \\frac{2\\pi}{Na}$.\n\nThe first Brillouin zone (BZ) for a one-dimensional lattice with spacing $a$ is defined by the interval $k \\in [-\\frac{\\pi}{a}, \\frac{\\pi}{a})$. The total number of distinct $k$-states within this BZ is equal to the number of lattice sites $N$. We can verify this: the range of the BZ is $\\frac{2\\pi}{a}$, and dividing this by the spacing $\\Delta k$ gives the number of states:\n$$N_{k-states} = \\frac{2\\pi/a}{2\\pi/Na} = N$$\nEach of these $k$-states can be occupied by two electrons, one with spin up and one with spin down, due to the specified two-fold spin degeneracy.\n\nThe system is at half-filling, which means the average number of electrons per site is one. For a system with $N$ lattice sites, the total number of electrons is $N_{elec} = 1 \\times N = N$.\n\nAt zero temperature ($T=0$), electrons fill the available energy states starting from the lowest energy up to the Fermi energy. In a simple tight-binding model, the lowest energy states correspond to the $k$-states closest to $k=0$. Thus, the occupied states form a continuous band centered at $k=0$, from $-k_F$ to $+k_F$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi wavevector.\n\nTo accommodate $N$ electrons, and since each $k$-state holds $2$ electrons, the number of occupied $k$-states must be:\n$$\\text{Number of occupied } k\\text{-states} = \\frac{N_{elec}}{2} = \\frac{N}{2}$$\nThe number of states in the interval $[-k_F, +k_F]$ can also be calculated by dividing the length of this interval, $2k_F$, by the spacing between states, $\\Delta k$.\n$$\\text{Number of occupied } k\\text{-states} = \\frac{2k_F}{\\Delta k} = \\frac{2k_F}{2\\pi/Na} = \\frac{k_F Na}{\\pi}$$\nEquating the two expressions for the number of occupied $k$-states:\n$$\\frac{k_F Na}{\\pi} = \\frac{N}{2}$$\nWe can now solve for the Fermi wavevector $k_F$:\n$$k_F = \\frac{N}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{Na} = \\frac{\\pi}{2a}$$\nThe problem asks for the value of $2k_F$, which is:\n$$2k_F = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2a} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$$\nThis quantity, $q=2k_F$, is the nesting vector of the Fermi surface in one dimension, connecting the Fermi points at $k=+k_F$ and $k=-k_F$. A Peierls distortion is driven by this nesting and has an ordering wavevector $q=2k_F$.\n\nThe problem then asks for the real-space periodicity, $\\lambda$, corresponding to this ordering wavevector $q$. The relationship between a wave's periodicity and its wavevector is given by $\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{q}$.\nSubstituting $q=2k_F = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{q} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi/a} = 2a$$\nThis result indicates that the lattice undergoes a distortion with a periodicity of $2a$, which corresponds to a dimerization of the chain (alternating short and long bonds). This doubles the size of the unit cell in real space and opens an energy gap at the Fermi level, turning the metal into an insulator.\n\nThe two quantities to be reported are $2k_F = \\frac{\\pi}{a}$ and $\\lambda = 2a$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\pi}{a} & 2a \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3009071"}, {"introduction": "A periodic lattice distortion fundamentally alters the electronic band structure, opening a gap at the Fermi level and driving a metal-insulator transition.
