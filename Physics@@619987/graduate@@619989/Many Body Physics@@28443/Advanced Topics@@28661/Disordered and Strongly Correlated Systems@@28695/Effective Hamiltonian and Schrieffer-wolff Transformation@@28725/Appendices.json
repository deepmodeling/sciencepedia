The parameters $t, U, V$ represent the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude, the on-site Coulomb repulsion, and the nearest-neighbor density-density interaction, respectively. The sum $\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle}$ runs over all pairs of nearest-neighbor sites.\n\nWe are interested in the strong coupling limit, where $U \\gg t, V$, and at half-filling, meaning there is an average of one electron per site. In this regime, the low-energy states are those with exactly one electron on each site, thus avoiding the large energy penalty $U$ from double occupancy. Virtual hopping processes, where an electron hops to an adjacent site and back, generate an effective interaction between the spins of the electrons.\n\nTo second order in the hopping amplitude $t$, the effective Hamiltonian for a single pair of nearest-neighbor sites $\\langle i,j \\rangle$ can be written in the form of a Heisenberg interaction plus a constant:\n$$ H_{\\text{eff}, ij} = J (\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j) + C $$\nwhere $\\vec{S}_i$ is the spin-1/2 operator for the electron at site $i$.\n\nDetermine the superexchange coupling constant $J$ in terms of $t$, $U$, and $V$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the effective Hamiltonian in the low-energy subspace of singly occupied sites, derived from the extended Hubbard model in the large-$U$ limit. We will use second-order perturbation theory.\n\nFirst, we partition the Hamiltonian $H$ into an unperturbed part $H_0$ and a perturbation $H'$. The dominant energy scale is the on-site repulsion $U$, so we define:\n$$ H_0 = U \\sum_i n_{i\\uparrow} n_{i\\downarrow} $$\nThe perturbation is the rest of the Hamiltonian:\n$$ H' = H_t + H_V = -t \\sum_{\\langle k,l \\rangle, \\sigma} (c_{k\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{l\\sigma} + \\text{h.c.}) + V \\sum_{\\langle k,l \\rangle} n_k n_l $$\n\nThe low-energy subspace, which we denote by $\\mathcal{L}$, consists of states with no doubly occupied sites. At half-filling, this means every site is singly occupied. The projector onto this subspace is $P$. The high-energy subspace, $\\mathcal{H}$, contains all other states (i.e., those with at least one doubly occupied site), and its projector is $Q=1-P$.\n\nThe hopping term $H_t$ is purely off-diagonal with respect to these subspaces, i.e., $P H_t P = Q H_t Q = 0$, because it always changes the number of doubly occupied sites. The interaction term $H_V$ is diagonal, as it does not change site occupations, so $P H_V Q = Q H_V P = 0$.\n\nThe effective Hamiltonian up to second order in the perturbation is given by:\n$$ H_{\\text{eff}} = P H' P + P H' Q \\frac{1}{E_0 - H_0 - Q H' Q} Q H' P $$\nwhere $E_0$ is the energy of the low-energy manifold under $H_0$. For states in $\\mathcal{L}$, there are no doubly occupied sites, so $H_0$ gives zero energy. Thus, $E_0=0$.\n\nLet's evaluate the terms for $H_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\n**First-order term:**\nThe first-order contribution is $P H' P = P(H_t + H_V)P = P H_V P$. In the subspace $\\mathcal{L}$, each site is occupied by exactly one electron, so the number operator $n_i$ acting on any state in $\\mathcal{L}$ gives eigenvalue 1. Therefore, $P n_i n_j P$ acts as the identity operator on $\\mathcal{L}$. The total first-order contribution is a constant energy shift:\n$$ P H_V P = V \\sum_{\\langle k,l \\rangle} P n_k n_l P = V \\sum_{\\langle k,l \\rangle} I = V N_b $$\nwhere $N_b$ is the total number of nearest-neighbor bonds in the lattice. This contributes to the constant term $C$ for each bond.\n\n**Second-order term:**\nThe second-order term involves the off-diagonal part of the perturbation, which is just $H_t$. The term is:\n$$ H_{\\text{eff}}^{(2)} = P H_t Q \\frac{1}{-H_0 - Q H_V Q} Q H_t P $$\nLet's determine the energy denominator. An intermediate state $|\\psi_{\\text{int}}\\rangle$ is created by applying $H_t$ to a state $|\\psi_0\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{L}$. For a specific hop from site $i$ to $j$, $|\\psi_{\\text{int}}\\rangle$ has a doubly occupied site $j$ and an empty site $i$. The energy of this state is:\n$$ E_{\\text{int}} = \\langle \\psi_{\\text{int}} | H_0 + H_V | \\psi_{\\text{int}} \\rangle $$\n$\\langle \\psi_{\\text{int}} | H_0 | \\psi_{\\text{int}} \\rangle = U$, since there is one doubly occupied site.\nTo find $\\langle \\psi_{\\text{int}} | H_V | \\psi_{\\text{int}} \\rangle$, we compare it with the energy of the initial state $\\langle \\psi_0 | H_V | \\psi_0 \\rangle$.\nIn $|\\psi_0\\rangle$, $n_k=1$ for all sites $k$. In $|\\psi_{\\text{int}}\\rangle$, we have $n_i=0$, $n_j=2$, and $n_k=1$ for $k \\ne i,j$.\nThe change in the interaction energy is due to bonds connected to $i$ or $j$. Let $z$ be the coordination number of the lattice.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Bond $\\langle i,j \\rangle$: The energy changes from $V(1 \\cdot 1)$ to $V(0 \\cdot 2)$. Change = $-V$.\n    \\item Bonds $\\langle i,k \\rangle$ where $k \\neq j$ ($z-1$ bonds): Energy changes from $V(1 \\cdot 1)$ to $V(0 \\cdot 1)$.

Change = $+(z-1)V$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe total change in $V$ energy when going from $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ to the intermediate state is $\\Delta E_V = -V - (z-1)V + (z-1)V = -V$.\nThe energy of the intermediate state is $E_{\\text{int}} = U - V + E_{V,0}$, where $E_{V,0}$ is the interaction energy of the initial state (excluding the bond $\\langle i,j \\rangle$ and its neighbors). The energy of the initial state is $E_0=E_{V,0}$. The energy denominator is $E_0 - E_{\\text{int}} = -(U-V)$.\nThus, the second-order effective Hamiltonian is:\n$$ H_{\\text{eff}}^{(2)} = -\\frac{1}{U-V} P H_t^2 P $$\nWe are interested in the part of this Hamiltonian corresponding to a specific bond $\\langle i,j \\rangle$.

Then the contribution from this bond is:\n$$ H_{\\text{eff}, ij}^{(2)} = -\\frac{1}{U-V} P (H_{t,ij})^2 P $$\nExpanding $(H_{t,ij})^2$ and keeping only terms that connect $\\mathcal{L}$ to $\\mathcal{H}$ and back gives:\n$$ P(H_{t,ij})^2 P = t^2 P \\sum_{\\sigma, \\sigma'} (c_{i\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{j\\sigma} c_{j\\sigma'}^\\dagger c_{i\\sigma'} + c_{j\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{i\\sigma} c_{i\\sigma'}^\\dagger c_{j\\sigma'}) P $$\nThis operator represents the sum of two processes: an electron hops $i \\to j$ and another hops $j \\to i$. The action of this operator on the spin states in $\\mathcal{L}$ can be shown to be equivalent to an operator involving the spin permutation operator $P_{ij}^{\\text{spin}}$, which swaps the spins on sites $i$ and $j$.\nThe explicit calculation of the action of $P(H_{t,ij})^2 P$ on a basis state like $|\\uparrow_i, \\downarrow_j\\rangle$ yields $2t^2(|\\uparrow_i, \\downarrow_j\\rangle - |\\downarrow_i, \\uparrow_j\\rangle) = 2t^2(I - P_{ij}^{\\text{spin}})|\\uparrow_i, \\downarrow_j\\rangle$.\nSo, we can write the operator identity within the subspace $\\mathcal{L}$:\n$$ P(H_{t,ij})^2 P = 2t^2(I - P_{ij}^{\\text{spin}}) $$\nUsing the relation for spin-1/2 operators, $P_{ij}^{\\text{spin}} = 2\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j + \\frac{1}{2}I$, we get:\n$$ P(H_{t,ij})^2 P = 2t^2(I - (2\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j + \\frac{1}{2}I)) = 2t^2(\\frac{1}{2}I - 2\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j) = -4t^2(\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j - \\frac{1}{4}I) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $H_{\\text{eff}, ij}^{(2)}$:\n$$ H_{\\text{eff}, ij}^{(2)} = -\\frac{1}{U-V} \\left[ -4t^2 \\left(\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j - \\frac{1}{4}I\\right) \\right] = \\frac{4t^2}{U-V} \\left(\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j - \\frac{1}{4}I\\right) $$\nThe total effective Hamiltonian for the bond $\\langle i,j \\rangle$ is the sum of the first-order contribution from $H_V$ for this bond ($V$) and the second-order term:\n$$ H_{\\text{eff}, ij} = V + \\frac{4t^2}{U-V} \\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j - \\frac{t^2}{U-V} $$\nThis is in the form $J (\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j) + C$, with $C = V - \\frac{t^2}{U-V}$.\nThe coefficient of the spin-spin interaction term, $\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j$, is the superexchange coupling $J$.\n$$ J = \\frac{4t^2}{U-V} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{4t^2}{U-V}} $$", "id": "1130138"}, {"introduction": "While second-order perturbation often captures the dominant physics, higher-order terms can reveal more exotic and subtle interactions.
