The stability of the Fermi surface against a deformation with a specific angular symmetry (e.g., $s$-wave, $p$-wave, $d$-wave) is determined by the corresponding spin-symmetric Landau parameter, $F_l^s$.

The number of states per unit area with energy less than $E$ is:\n$$\nN(E) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{2mE}{\\hbar^2}\\right) = \\frac{mE}{\\pi\\hbar^2}\n$$\nThe density of states per unit area, $D(E)$, is the derivative of $N(E)$ with respect to energy:\n$$\nD(E) = \\frac{dN(E)}{dE} = \\frac{m}{\\pi\\hbar^2}\n$$\nA key feature of the non-relativistic 2DEG is that its density of states is constant, independent of the energy $E$.
