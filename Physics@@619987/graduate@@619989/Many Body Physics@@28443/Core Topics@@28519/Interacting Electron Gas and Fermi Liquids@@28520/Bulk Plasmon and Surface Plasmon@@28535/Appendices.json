A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the frequency of longitudinal surface charge oscillations at the interface between two media. We start from the provided electrostatic equation, which holds in a source-free region:\n$$\n\\nabla\\cdot\\left(\\epsilon(\\mathbf{r}, \\omega)\\nabla\\phi(\\mathbf{r}, \\omega)\\right) = 0\n$$\nIn this problem, the permittivity $\\epsilon$ is a function of frequency $\\omega$ but is spatially uniform within each half-space. Thus, in each medium, the equation simplifies to Laplace's equation for the scalar potential $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2\\phi = 0\n$$\nWe are looking for a bound surface mode, which is a wave that propagates along the interface (in the $xy$-plane) and decays exponentially into both media away from the interface. Due to the translational symmetry in the $xy$-plane, we can seek a solution of the form:\n$$\n\\phi(x, y, z) = f(z) e^{i(k_x x + k_y y)}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k}_‖ = (k_x, k_y)$ is the in-plane wavevector. Let's align the propagation direction with the $x$-axis without loss of generality, so $k_y=0$ and the wavevector magnitude is $k_‖ = |k_x|$. The potential then takes the form $\\phi(x, z) = f(z)e^{ik_x x}$. Substituting this into Laplace's equation, $\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\\right)\\phi = 0$, gives:\n$$\n(-k_x^2 f(z) + \\frac{d^2f(z)}{dz^2})e^{ik_x x} = 0\n$$\nThis leads to an ordinary differential equation for $f(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f(z)}{dz^2} - k_x^2 f(z) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is $f(z) = A e^{k_x z} + B e^{-k_x z}$. We must apply this solution to each medium and enforce the boundary condition that the potential vanishes far from the interface, i.e., $\\phi \\to 0$ as $|z| \\to \\infty$. We assume $k_x$ is real and positive.\n\nIn the dielectric medium ($z>0$), the potential must decay as $z \\to \\infty$. This requires the coefficient of the $e^{k_x z}$ term to be zero. Thus, the potential in the dielectric is:\n$$\n\\phi_d(x, z) = A e^{-k_x z} e^{ik_x x} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad z>0\n$$\nIn the metal medium ($z<0$), the potential must decay as $z \\to -\\infty$. This requires the coefficient of the $e^{-k_x z}$ term to be zero. Thus, the potential in the metal is:\n$$\n\\phi_m(x, z) = B e^{k_x z} e^{ik_x x} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad z<0\n$$\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions at the interface $z=0$.\n\n1.  Continuity of the scalar potential $\\phi$:\n    $$\n    \\phi_d(x, z=0) = \\phi_m(x, z=0)\n    $$\n    $$\n    A e^0 e^{ik_x x} = B e^0 e^{ik_x x} \\implies A = B\n    $$\n    For simplicity, we can set $B=A$.\n\n2.  Continuity of the normal component of the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$. The normal direction is the $z$-direction. The component $D_z$ is given by $D_z = \\epsilon(\\omega) \\epsilon_0 E_z = -\\epsilon(\\omega) \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial z}$. The boundary condition is:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_d \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial\\phi_d}{\\partial z}\\bigg|_{z=0} = \\epsilon_m(\\omega) \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial\\phi_m}{\\partial z}\\bigg|_{z=0}\n    $$\n    The constant $\\epsilon_0$ cancels out. Let's compute the derivatives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial\\phi_d}{\\partial z} = -k_x A e^{-k_x z} e^{ik_x x} \\implies \\frac{\\partial\\phi_d}{\\partial z}\\bigg|_{z=0} = -k_x A e^{ik_x x}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial\\phi_m}{\\partial z} = k_x A e^{k_x z} e^{ik_x x} \\implies \\frac{\\partial\\phi_m}{\\partial z}\\bigg|_{z=0} = k_x A e^{ik_x x}\n    $$\n    Substituting these into the boundary condition gives:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_d (-k_x A e^{ik_x x}) = \\epsilon_m(\\omega) (k_x A e^{ik_x x})\n    $$\n    For a non-trivial solution to exist, we must have $A \\neq 0$ and $k_x \\neq 0$. We can thus divide both sides by $-k_x A e^{ik_x x}$:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_d = -\\epsilon_m(\\omega)\n    $$\n    This relation, $\\epsilon_d + \\epsilon_m(\\omega) = 0$, is the general existence condition for a surface plasmon mode at the interface between two media in the electrostatic limit. For a bound mode to exist, we require that the permittivities have opposite signs. Since $\\epsilon_d > 0$ for a dielectric, we must have $\\epsilon_m(\\omega) < 0$, which is characteristic of a metal below its plasma frequency.\n\nTo find the surface plasmon frequency $\\omega_s$, we substitute the given expression for the metal's permittivity, $\\epsilon_{m}(\\omega)=\\epsilon_{\\infty}-\\omega_{p}^{2}/\\omega^{2}$, into the existence condition. Let $\\omega_s$ be the frequency that satisfies this condition:\n$$\n\\epsilon_d + \\left(\\epsilon_{\\infty} - \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega_s^2}\\right) = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $\\omega_s$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_d + \\epsilon_{\\infty} = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega_s^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_s^2 = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\epsilon_{\\infty} + \\epsilon_d}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the final expression for the surface plasmon frequency:\n$$\n\\omega_s = \\frac{\\omega_p}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\infty} + \\epsilon_d}}\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon_d>0$ and $\\epsilon_{\\infty}>1$, the denominator is real and greater than $1$, ensuring that $\\omega_s < \\omega_p$.
