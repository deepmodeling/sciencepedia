A formal derivation and solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the quasiparticle band gap, $E_g^{GW}$, begins with the fundamental quasiparticle equation for the conduction band minimum (state $c$) and the valence band maximum (state $v$). Using the provided approximation $Z_i \\approx 1$, the equations for the quasiparticle energies $E_c$ and $E_v$ are:\n$$\nE_c \\approx \\varepsilon_c + \\langle \\psi_c \\lvert \\Sigma - V_{xc} \\rvert \\psi_c \\rangle\n$$\n$$\nE_v \\approx \\varepsilon_v + \\langle \\psi_v \\lvert \\Sigma - V_{xc} \\rvert \\psi_v \\rangle\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon_c$ and $\\varepsilon_v$ are the Kohn-Sham eigenvalues. The quasiparticle band gap is the difference $E_g^{GW} = E_c - E_v$. Subtracting the two equations yields:\n$$\nE_g^{GW} \\approx (\\varepsilon_c - \\varepsilon_v) + \\left( \\langle \\psi_c \\lvert \\Sigma \\rvert \\psi_c \\rangle - \\langle \\psi_v \\lvert \\Sigma \\rvert \\psi_v \\rangle \\right) - \\left( \\langle \\psi_c \\lvert V_{xc} \\rvert \\psi_c \\rangle - \\langle \\psi_v \\lvert V_{xc} \\rvert \\psi_v \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nThe first term, $\\varepsilon_c - \\varepsilon_v$, is precisely the Kohn-Sham band gap from the starting DFT calculation, which we denote as $E_g^{\\mathrm{DFT}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nE_g^{GW} \\approx E_g^{\\mathrm{DFT}} + \\Delta\\Sigma - \\Delta V_{xc}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\Sigma = \\langle \\psi_c \\lvert \\Sigma \\rvert \\psi_c \\rangle - \\langle \\psi_v \\lvert \\Sigma \\rvert \\psi_v \\rangle$ and $\\Delta V_{xc} = \\langle \\psi_c \\lvert V_{xc} \\rvert \\psi_c \\rangle - \\langle \\psi_v \\lvert V_{xc} \\rvert \\psi_v \\rangle$. We must now model these two terms using the given assumptions.\n\nFirst, we analyze the self-energy correction, $\\Delta\\Sigma$. We employ the static COHSEX approximation, $\\Sigma \\approx \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SEX}} + \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{COH}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta\\Sigma \\approx \\left( \\langle \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SEX}} \\rangle_c - \\langle \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SEX}} \\rangle_v \\right) + \\left( \\langle \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{COH}} \\rangle_c - \\langle \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{COH}} \\rangle_v \\right)\n$$\nBased on the problem statement, the Coulomb-hole contributions are assumed to approximately cancel, so $\\langle \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{COH}} \\rangle_c - \\langle \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{COH}} \\rangle_v \\approx 0$. Further, the screened exchange is assumed to be negligible for the unoccupied conduction state, $\\langle \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SEX}} \\rangle_c \\approx 0$. This simplifies the self-energy correction to:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Sigma \\approx - \\langle \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SEX}} \\rangle_v\n$$\nThe screened exchange operator, in the static limit with scalar screening $W_0 \\approx v/\\epsilon_{\\infty}$, is related to the bare Fock exchange operator $V_x^{\\mathrm{HF}}$ by $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SEX}} \\approx V_x^{\\mathrm{HF}} / \\epsilon_{\\infty}$. The expectation value of the bare Fock exchange for an occupied state $\\psi_v$ defines the effective exchange integral scale, $\\langle \\psi_v \\lvert V_x^{\\mathrm{HF}} \\rvert \\psi_v \\rangle \\approx -K_x$, where $K_x$ is a positive quantity representing the self-exchange energy. Therefore:\n$$\n\\langle \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SEX}} \\rangle_v \\approx \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\infty}} \\langle \\psi_v \\lvert V_x^{\\mathrm{HF}} \\rvert \\psi_v \\rangle \\approx -\\frac{K_x}{\\epsilon_{\\infty}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we find the self-energy contribution to the gap correction:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Sigma \\approx - \\left( -\\frac{K_x}{\\epsilon_{\\infty}} \\right) = \\frac{K_x}{\\epsilon_{\\infty}}\n$$\n\nNext, we address the exchange-correlation potential term, $\\Delta V_{xc}$. The problem provides a direct model for this term to account for the starting-point dependence:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{xc} = \\langle \\psi_c \\lvert V_{xc} \\rvert \\psi_c \\rangle - \\langle \\psi_v \\lvert V_{xc} \\rvert \\psi_v \\rangle \\approx \\alpha K_x\n$$\nThis approximation correctly models the fact that a fraction $\\alpha$ of Fock exchange, when introduced into the DFT functional, primarily deepens the energy of the occupied valence state $\\psi_v$ by an amount proportional to $K_x$, thus widening the difference between the expectation values of the potential for states $c$ and $v$.\n\nFinally, assembling all the pieces into the expression for $E_g^{GW}$:\n$$\nE_g^{GW} \\approx E_g^{\\mathrm{DFT}} + \\Delta\\Sigma - \\Delta V_{xc}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived forms for $\\Delta\\Sigma$ and $\\Delta V_{xc}$:\n$$\nE_g^{GW} \\approx E_g^{\\mathrm{DFT}} + \\frac{K_x}{\\epsilon_{\\infty}} - \\alpha K_x\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the structure of the correction:\n$$\nE_g^{GW} \\approx E_g^{\\mathrm{DFT}} + K_x \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_{\\infty}} - \\alpha \\right)\n$$\nThis is the final, simplified expression for the quasiparticle band gap. It explicitly shows how the $G_0W_0$ correction depends on the screening environment ($\\epsilon_{\\infty}$) and subtracts the bare exchange ($\\alpha K_x$) already accounted for in the starting DFT calculation.
