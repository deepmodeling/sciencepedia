This first exercise provides the ideal starting point by considering the simplest non-trivial interacting spin system: two spins on a ladder rung. By mapping this system's Hamiltonian to a fermionic representation, you will see firsthand how the ubiquitous spin-exchange interaction, often written as $S_i^x S_j^x + S_i^y S_j^y$, translates into the fundamental process of a fermion hopping between sites [@problem_id:1136925].

Periodic boundary conditions imply no intra-leg neighbors (since each leg has only 1 site), so the only nearest-neighbor pair is the rung connecting site 1 and site 2.  \n\nUse the Jordan-Wigner transformation to map the spin operators to fermionic operators, then diagonalize the resulting Hamiltonian to find the ground state energy.", "solution": "1.

This calculation illuminates how the string generates crucial phase factors that depend on the occupation of the intermediate sites, a key mechanical and conceptual aspect of the transformation.", "problem": "In the study of one-dimensional quantum spin systems, the Jordan-Wigner transformation is a powerful tool that maps spin operators to fermionic creation and annihilation operators. This allows the use of many-body techniques from fermionic systems to solve spin problems.\n\nConsider a 1D chain of 4 sites, each with a spin-1/2 particle. The spin operators at site $i$ are denoted by $S_i^x, S_i^y, S_i^z$, with ladder operators $S_i^\\pm = S_i^x \\pm i S_i^y$. We map the spin states to fermionic Fock states by identifying a spin-up state at site $i$ with an occupied fermionic site ($n_i=1$) and a spin-down state with an empty site ($n_i=0$). The fermionic vacuum $|0\\rangle_f \\equiv |0000\\rangle$ corresponds to the state with all spins down, where all sites are empty. A generic Fock state is denoted by $|n_1 n_2 n_3 n_4\\rangle$.\n\nUnder this convention, the Jordan-Wigner transformation for the spin ladder operators is given by:\n$$S_j^+ = \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{j-1} (2n_k-1) \\right) c_j^\\dagger$$\n$$S_j^- = \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{j-1} (2n_k-1) \\right) c_j$$\nwhere $c_j^\\dagger$ and $c_j$ are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators for a fermion at site $j$, and $n_k=c_k^\\dagger c_k$ is the fermion number operator at site $k$. The product $\\prod_{k=1}^{j-1} (\\dots)$ is known as the Jordan-Wigner string. Note that for $j=1$, the string is an empty product, which equals 1. The fermionic operators obey the standard anti-commutation relations: $\\{c_i, c_j^\\dagger\\} = \\delta_{ij}$ and $\\{c_i, c_j\\} = \\{c_i^\\dagger, c_j^\\dagger\\} = 0$.\n\nYour task is to compute the matrix element of the long-range spin-hopping operator $S_1^+ S_3^-$ between two fermionic Fock states.
