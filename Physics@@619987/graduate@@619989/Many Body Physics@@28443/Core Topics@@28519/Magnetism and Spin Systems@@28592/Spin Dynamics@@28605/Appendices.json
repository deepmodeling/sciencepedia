It consists of $N$ Ising spins, $S_i = \\pm 1$, with an all-to-all random interaction. The Hamiltonian is given by:\n$$\nH = -\\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le N} J_{ij} S_i S_j\n$$\nwhere the couplings $J_{ij}$ are chosen from a random distribution. For a specific realization of the couplings (a specific \"instance\"), the system may exhibit frustration, leading to a complex energy landscape with many local minima and potentially a degenerate ground state at zero temperature ($T=0$).\n\nA key quantity to characterize the spin-glass phase is the Edwards-Anderson (EA) order parameter, defined as:\n$$\nq_{EA} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle S_i \\rangle^2\n$$\nAt $T=0$, the thermal average $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ becomes an average over all degenerate ground state configurations. Due to the global spin-flip symmetry of the Hamiltonian ($H(\\{S_i\\}) = H(\\{-S_i\\})$), a naive average over all ground states often yields $\\langle S_i \\rangle = 0$ for all spins, resulting in $q_{EA}=0$. To properly capture the \"frozen\" nature of spins in one of the system's macroscopic states (or \"valleys\"), one must perform the average only over the ground states belonging to a single valley. These valleys are sets of ground states that are not connected by global symmetries. For the system considered here, the set of all ground states can be partitioned into two valleys, where one valley is the global spin-flip of the other.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider a system of $N=4$ Ising spins, described by a specific instance of the SK model.

The parameters $J_0$ and $J_1$ are positive constants, and it is given that $J_0$ is much larger than $J_1$ ($J_0 \\gg J_1$).\n\nYour task is to compute the Edwards-Anderson order parameter $q_{EA}$ at zero temperature for a single valley of ground states.
