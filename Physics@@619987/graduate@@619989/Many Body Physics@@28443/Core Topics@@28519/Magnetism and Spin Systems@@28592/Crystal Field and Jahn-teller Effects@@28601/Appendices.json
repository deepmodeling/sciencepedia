We are to use second-order perturbation theory in the limit where the energy separation between the metal $d$ and ligand $p$ states, $\\Delta_{dp} = \\epsilon_{d} - \\epsilon_{p}$, is large compared to the hopping integrals.\n\nThe unperturbed Hamiltonian, $H_{0}$, describes the system with no interaction between the metal and the ligands. Its eigenstates are the five metal $d$ orbitals, all with energy $\\epsilon_{d}$, and the $6 \\times 3 = 18$ ligand $p$ orbitals, all with energy $\\epsilon_{p}$. The perturbation, $H'$, is the Hamiltonian term that describes the covalent hopping (hybridization) between the metal $d$ orbitals and the ligand $p$ orbitals.\n\nAccording to second-order perturbation theory, the energy shift $\\Delta E_{i}^{(2)}$ for a specific metal $d$ orbital $|d_{i}\\rangle$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta E_{d_{i}}^{(2)} = \\sum_{j} \\frac{|\\langle\\psi_{p,j}| H' |d_{i}\\rangle|^2}{E_{d}^{(0)} - E_{p}^{(0)}} $$\nwhere the sum runs over all $18$ unperturbed ligand $p$ orbitals, which we denote collectively as $|\\psi_{p,j}\\rangle$. The unperturbed energies are $E_{d}^{(0)} = \\epsilon_{d}$ and $E_{p}^{(0)} = \\epsilon_{p}$. The denominator is therefore the given energy separation, $\\Delta_{dp} = \\epsilon_{d} - \\epsilon_{p}$. The formula becomes:\n$$ \\Delta E_{d_{i}}^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta_{dp}} \\sum_{j=1}^{18} |\\langle\\psi_{p,j}| H' |d_{i}\\rangle|^2 $$\nThe matrix elements $\\langle\\psi_{p,j}| H' |d_{i}\\rangle$ are the hopping integrals, which are parameterized using the Slater-Koster (SK) two-center integral scheme. We are given the parameters $V_{pd\\sigma}$ and $V_{pd\\pi}$.\n\nIn the octahedral ($O_{h}$) symmetry of the crystal field, the five degenerate $d$ orbitals of the free ion split into two sets corresponding to two irreducible representations of the $O_h$ group:\n1.  The $e_{g}$ orbitals: {$d_{3z^{2}-r^{2}}$, $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$}, which are doubly degenerate.\n2.  The $t_{2g}$ orbitals: {$d_{xy}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{zx}$}, which are triply degenerate.\n\nBy symmetry, all orbitals within a given irreducible representation must have the same energy. Therefore, we only need to calculate the energy shift for one representative orbital from each set.\n\nThe hopping integrals depend on the orientation of the bond axis relative to the orbitals. We analyze the interactions with the six ligands located at $(\\pm a, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\pm a, 0)$, and $(0, 0, \\pm a)$. It is most convenient to evaluate the SK integrals by considering the local symmetry of each metal-ligand bond. For a bond oriented along the $z$-axis, orbitals are classified by their angular momentum projection onto this axis ($\\sigma, \\pi, \\delta, \\dots$). The non-zero hopping integrals are only between orbitals of the same symmetry type. For a metal $d$ orbital and a ligand $p$ orbital, the non-zero interactions are:\n-   $\\langle d_{3z^2-r^2}| H' |p_z \\rangle = V_{pd\\sigma}$ ($\\sigma$-type interaction)\n-   $\\langle d_{zx}| H' |p_x \\rangle = V_{pd\\pi}$ ($\\pi$-type interaction)\n-   $\\langle d_{yz}| H' |p_y \\rangle = V_{pd\\pi}$ ($\\pi$-type interaction)\nAll other $d$-$p$ interactions for a bond along the $z$-axis are zero by symmetry.\n\n**Energy Shift of the $e_{g}$ levels**\n\nLet us calculate the shift for the $|d_{x^2-y^2}\\rangle$ orbital. We sum the squared hopping integrals over all six ligands.\n\n1.  **Ligands on the $z$-axis ($0, 0, \\pm a$):** The bond axis is $z$. The $|d_{x^2-y^2}\\rangle$ orbital has $\\delta$ symmetry with respect to this axis.

The $|d_{x^2-y^2}\\rangle$ orbital has lobes pointing along the $x$ and $y$ axes, participating in $\\sigma$-type bonding with ligands on these axes.

The $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ orbital has $\\delta$ symmetry with respect to this axis, so it does not interact with any of the ligand $p$ orbitals. The contribution is zero.\n\n2.  **Ligands on the $x$-axis ($\\pm a, 0, 0$):** The bond axis is $x$. The $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ orbital lobes are between the $x$ and $y$ axes. This orbital forms a $\\pi$-bond with the ligand $p_y$ orbital. Using the SK rules or symmetry considerations:\n    $$ |\\langle p_y @ (\\pm a,0,0) | H' | d_{xy} \\rangle|^2 = V_{pd\\pi}^2 $$\n    The interaction with $p_x$ and $p_z$ orbitals is zero by symmetry. The total contribution from the two ligands on the $x$-axis is $2 \\times V_{pd\\pi}^2$.\n\n3.  **Ligands on the $y$-axis ($0, \\pm a, 0$):** The bond axis is $y$. By symmetry with the previous case (swapping $x$ and $y$), the $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ orbital forms a $\\pi$-bond with the ligand $p_x$ orbital.\n    $$ |\\langle p_x @ (0,\\pm a,0) | H' | d_{xy} \\rangle|^2 = V_{pd\\pi}^2 $$\n    The total contribution from the two ligands on the $y$-axis is $2 \\times V_{pd\\pi}^2$.\n\nThe total sum of squared matrix elements for $|d_{xy}\\rangle$ is $0 + 2V_{pd\\pi}^2 + 2V_{pd\\pi}^2 = 4V_{pd\\pi}^2$.
