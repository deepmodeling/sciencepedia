This system is a toy model for a spin glass.\n\nThe model is the Edwards-Anderson $\\pm J$ Ising model on a single triangular plaquette.

Since each coupling is chosen independently, each of these 8 configurations has a probability of $(1/2)^3 = 1/8$.\n\nA key concept for this problem is frustration. A plaquette is frustrated if the product of the signs of the couplings around the loop is negative. For our triangle, the frustration measure is $\\Phi = \\text{sgn}(J_{12}J_{23}J_{31})$.\n- If $\\Phi = +1$, the plaquette is **unfrustrated**.\n- If $\\Phi = -1$, the plaquette is **frustrated**.\n\nWe can classify the 8 disorder configurations based on whether they are frustrated or not.\n\n**Case 1: Unfrustrated configurations ($\\Phi = +1$)**\nThis occurs if the number of negative (antiferromagnetic, $-J$) couplings is even (i.e., zero or two).\n- **Zero negative couplings:** All couplings are $+J$. This is the configuration $(+J, +J, +J)$. There is $\\binom{3}{0} = 1$ such configuration.\n- **Two negative couplings:** Two couplings are $-J$ and one is $+J$. An example is $(+J, -J, -J)$. There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ such configurations.\nIn total, there are $1+3=4$ unfrustrated configurations.\n\nFor an unfrustrated plaquette, it is possible to find a spin configuration that satisfies all interaction bonds simultaneously. A bond $\\langle ij \\rangle$ is satisfied if $J_{ij}S_iS_j > 0$. The ground state energy is achieved when all bonds are satisfied.\nFor any unfrustrated configuration, the ground-state energy is:\n$$E_g^{\\text{unfrust.}} = -\\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} |J_{ij}| = -(|J_{12}| + |J_{23}| + |J_{31}|)$$\nSince $|J_{ij}| = J$ for all bonds, the ground-state energy for any unfrustrated configuration is:\n$$E_g^{\\text{unfrust.}} = -J - J - J = -3J$$\nFor example, for $(+J, -J, -J)$, we can choose spins $(S_1, S_2, S_3) = (+1, +1, -1)$.\nThe energy is $H = -(+J)(+1)(+1) - (-J)(+1)(-1) - (-J)(-1)(+1) = -J - J - J = -3J$.\n\n**Case 2: Frustrated configurations ($\\Phi = -1$)**\nThis occurs if the number of negative couplings is odd (i.e., one or three).\n- **One negative coupling:** One coupling is $-J$ and two are $+J$.

A satisfied bond contributes $-J$ to the energy, while an unsatisfied bond ($J_{ij}S_iS_j < 0$) contributes $+J$.\nSo, the ground-state energy for any frustrated configuration is:\n$$E_g^{\\text{frust.}} = (-J) + (-J) + (+J) = -J$$\n\nLet's verify this for a generic frustrated configuration, say $J_{12}=J, J_{23}=J, J_{31}=-J$.\nThe Hamiltonian is $H = -J S_1 S_2 - J S_2 S_3 + J S_3 S_1$.
