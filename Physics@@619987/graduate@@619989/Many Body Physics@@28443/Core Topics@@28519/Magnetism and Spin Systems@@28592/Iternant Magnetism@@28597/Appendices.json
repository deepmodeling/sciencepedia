Consider a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas with an effective mass $m$ and parabolic dispersion relation $\\epsilon(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 |\\mathbf{k}|^2}{2m}$. In the Stoner model, a simplified local interaction between electrons is introduced. Within the mean-field approximation at zero temperature ($T=0$), this interaction adds a term to the total energy per unit area of the form $\\mathcal{E}_{int} = I n_{\\uparrow} n_{\\downarrow}$, where $n_{\\uparrow}$ and $n_{\\downarrow}$ are the number densities (number of electrons per unit area) of spin-up and spin-down electrons, respectively, and $I$ is the Stoner parameter representing the strength of the effective interaction.\n\nThe total energy of the system is the sum of the kinetic energy of the spin-up and spin-down electrons and this interaction energy.
