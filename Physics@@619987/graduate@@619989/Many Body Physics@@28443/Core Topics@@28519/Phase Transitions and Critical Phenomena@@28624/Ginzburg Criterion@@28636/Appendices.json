For a classical system with an $N$-component vector order parameter $\\vec{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x}) = (\\phi_1(\\mathbf{x}), \\dots, \\phi_N(\\mathbf{x}))$, the O(N) symmetric GL functional in $d$ spatial dimensions is given by:\n$$F[\\vec{\\phi}] = \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\left[ \\frac{c}{2} (\\nabla \\vec{\\phi})^2 + \\frac{r}{2} \\vec{\\phi}^2 + \\frac{u}{4} (\\vec{\\phi}^2)^2 \\right]$$\nwhere $(\\nabla \\vec{\\phi})^2 = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^N |\\nabla\\phi_\\alpha|^2$ and $\\vec{\\phi}^2 = \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^N \\phi_\\alpha^2$. The parameters $c$ and $u$ are positive constants. The parameter $r$ depends on the temperature $T$ as $r \\approx r_0 t$, where $t = (T-T_c^{MF})/T_c^{MF}$ is the reduced temperature relative to the mean-field critical temperature $T_c^{MF}$, and $r_0$ is a positive constant.\n\nMean-field theory (MFT), which neglects fluctuations, provides a first approximation of the system's behavior. However, fluctuations become important close to the critical point. The Ginzburg criterion determines the temperature range, defined by the Ginzburg number $Gi$, where MFT breaks down.\n\nOne way to establish this criterion is to analyze the effect of fluctuations on the parameters of the GL theory itself. In a one-loop perturbative calculation in the disordered phase ($T>T_c^{MF}$, $r>0$), the parameter $r$ receives a correction from the fluctuation self-energy, $\\Sigma(r)$. The renormalized parameter $r_{ren}$ is related to the bare parameter $r$ by $r_{ren} = r + \\Sigma(r)$. A proper treatment involves renormalization, which shows that MFT is valid when the temperature-dependent part of the self-energy is small compared to the mean-field term $r$. That is, MFT holds when $r \\gg |\\Sigma(r) - \\Sigma(0)|$. The Ginzburg number $Gi$ corresponds to the value of the reduced temperature $|t|$ where these two terms become comparable.\n\nFor the O(N) model, the one-loop self-energy at zero external momentum is given by:\n$$\\Sigma(r) = \\frac{u(N+2)}{2} k_B T_c \\int^\\Lambda \\frac{d^d q}{(2\\pi)^d} \\frac{1}{cq^2+r}$$\nwhere $\\Lambda$ is an ultraviolet momentum cutoff, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and we approximate the temperature prefactor by $T_c \\equiv T_c^{MF}$.\n\nAssuming the spatial dimension $d$ is in the range $2 < d < 4$, determine the Ginzburg number for the O(N) model, $Gi(N,d)$, and express the ratio $\\frac{Gi(N,d)}{Gi(1,d)}$, where $Gi(1,d)$ is the Ginzburg number for the corresponding Ising model ($N=1$).", "solution": "1.

The Ginzburg criterion states that MFT breaks down when the correction is of the same order as the bare term, i.e., $r \\sim |\\Sigma(r) - \\Sigma(0)|$.
