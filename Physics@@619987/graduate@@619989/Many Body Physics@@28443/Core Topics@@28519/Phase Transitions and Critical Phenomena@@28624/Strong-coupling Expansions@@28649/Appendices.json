In the strong coupling limit, where on-site repulsion $U$ dominates the kinetic hopping $t$, the low-energy charge-frozen states exhibit rich magnetic behavior. This exercise guides you through one of the most crucial derivations in condensed matter theory: obtaining the effective Heisenberg antiferromagnetic Hamiltonian from the Hubbard model at half-filling using second-order degenerate perturbation theory. Mastering this calculation is key to understanding how spin physics emerges from charge dynamics in strongly correlated materials [@problem_id:1201221].", "problem": "The Hubbard model on a one-dimensional chain with $N_s$ sites is described by the Hamiltonian:\n$$H = -t \\sum_{i=1, \\sigma}^{N_s} (c_{i,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{i+1,\\sigma} + c_{i+1,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{i,\\sigma}) + U \\sum_{i=1}^{N_s} n_{i,\\uparrow} n_{i,\\downarrow}$$\nHere, $c_{i,\\sigma}^\\dagger$ ($c_{i,\\sigma}$) creates (annihilates) an electron with spin $\\sigma \\in \\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$ at site $i$, $n_{i,\\sigma} = c_{i,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{i,\\sigma}$ is the number operator, $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude, and $U$ is the on-site Coulomb repulsion. Assume periodic boundary conditions ($c_{N_s+1,\\sigma} \\equiv c_{1,\\sigma}$).\n\nThe system is at half-filling, meaning the number of electrons $N_e$ is equal to the number of sites $N_s$. In the strong-coupling limit where $U \\gg t$, calculate the ground-state energy per site, $E_0/N_s$, to second order in the expansion parameter $t/U$.", "solution": "We treat the Hubbard model in the strong-coupling limit ($U \\gg t$) using degenerate perturbation theory. We split the Hamiltonian into an unperturbed part $H_0$ and a perturbation $H_1$:\n$$H_0 = U \\sum_{i=1}^{N_s} n_{i,\\uparrow} n_{i,\\downarrow}$$\n$$H_1 = -t \\sum_{i=1, \\sigma}^{N_s} (c_{i,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{i+1,\\sigma} + c_{i+1,\\sigma}^\\dagger c_{i,\\sigma})$$\n**Zeroth-Order Ground State**\n\nThe unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal in the site-occupation basis. Its energy is $U$ times the number of doubly occupied sites. To minimize the energy, we must minimize the number of such sites. At half-filling ($N_e=N_s$), it is possible to have exactly one electron per site, resulting in zero double occupancies.\n\nThe ground state of $H_0$ is thus a manifold of states with no doubly occupied sites. The energy of any state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ in this manifold is $E^{(0)} = 0$. This ground state is highly degenerate, as the spin of the electron at each site can be up or down, leading to a degeneracy of $2^{N_s}$.\n\n**First-Order Correction**\n\nThe first-order energy correction for the degenerate ground state manifold is given by the eigenvalues of the matrix $P H_1 P$, where $P$ is the projector onto the ground-state manifold. Any state in the manifold has single occupancy at each site. The hopping Hamiltonian $H_1$ acts on such a state by moving an electron from one site to a neighbor, which necessarily creates a doubly occupied site and an empty site. The resulting state is outside the degenerate manifold. Therefore, $P H_1 P = 0$, and the first-order energy correction is zero:\n$$E^{(1)} = 0$$\n\n**Second-Order Correction**\n\nThe second-order correction is found by diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian acting within the degenerate manifold:\n$$H_{\\text{eff}} = P H_1 \\frac{Q}{E^{(0)} - H_0} H_1 P$$\nwhere $Q = 1-P$ is the projector onto the excited states.\nAs established, $H_1$ acting on a ground state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ produces an excited state $|\\psi_{\\text{exc}}\\rangle$ with one empty site and one doubly occupied site. The energy of this excited state under $H_0$ is $E_{\\text{exc}}^{(0)} = U$. With $E^{(0)}=0$, the energy denominator is $E^{(0)} - E_{\\text{exc}}^{(0)} = -U$.\nThe effective Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$H_{\\text{eff}} = -\\frac{1}{U} P H_1^2 P$$\nWe need to evaluate the action of $H_1^2$ on the ground-state manifold. A non-zero contribution arises only if the sequence of two hops returns the system to a state with single occupancy on every site. This happens when an electron hops from site $i$ to a neighbor $j$ and then an electron hops back from $j$ to $i$.\n\nConsider two adjacent sites, $i$ and $j$. Let the initial spin configuration be $|\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j\\rangle$.\n1.  An electron with spin $\\sigma_i$ hops from $i \\to j$. This is only possible via the Pauli principle if site $j$ does not already have a spin-$\\sigma_i$ electron, i.e., $\\sigma_j = \\bar{\\sigma}_i$. The intermediate state has site $i$ empty and site $j$ doubly occupied. The matrix element for this hop is $-t$.\n2.  From this virtual state, an electron must hop back from $j \\to i$. There are two possibilities:\n    a. The same electron (spin $\\sigma_i$) hops back. This restores the original state $|\\sigma_i, \\sigma_j\\rangle$. The matrix element is $-t$.\n    b. The other electron (spin $\\sigma_j$) hops back. This results in the state $|\\sigma_j, \\sigma_i\\rangle$, where spins are exchanged. The matrix element is $-t$.\n\nThe total amplitude for a process on the bond $\\langle i,j \\rangle$ is the sum over all such virtual paths, divided by $-U$.\n-   **Diagonal term (no spin flip):** The process $i \\to j \\to i$ with the same spin contributes $\\frac{(-t)(-t)}{-U} = -t^2/U$. The process $j \\to i \\to j$ also contributes $-t^2/U$. This occurs only if the spins are anti-parallel. Total contribution: $-2t^2/U$.\n-   **Off-diagonal term (spin exchange):** The process $i \\to j$ (spin $\\sigma_i$) followed by $j \\to i$ (spin $\\sigma_j$) contributes $\\frac{(-t)(-t)}{-U} = -t^2/U$. The process $j \\to i$ (spin $\\sigma_j$) followed by $i \\to j$ (spin $\\sigma_i$) also contributes $-t^2/U$. Total contribution: $-2t^2/U$.\n\nIf spins are parallel (e.g., $|\\uparrow_i, \\uparrow_j\\rangle$), hopping is forbidden, so the matrix elements are zero.\nThe effective Hamiltonian for the pair of sites $\\langle i,j \\rangle$ in the basis $\\{|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle, |\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle\\}$ is:\n$$H_{\\text{eff, ij}} = -\\frac{2t^2}{U} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis operator has eigenvalues $0$ (for the triplet state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle + |\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle)$) and $-4t^2/U$ (for the singlet state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\rangle - |\\downarrow\\uparrow\\rangle)$).\n\nThis is the spectrum of the operator $J(\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j - 1/4)$ with $J = 4t^2/U$.\n-   For a triplet state ($S_{\\text{tot}}=1$), $\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j = 1/4$, giving energy $J(1/4-1/4)=0$.\n-   For a singlet state ($S_{\\text{tot}}=0$), $\\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j = -3/4$, giving energy $J(-3/4-1/4)=-J=-4t^2/U$.\n\nThe total effective Hamiltonian is the sum over all nearest-neighbor bonds:\n$$H_{\\text{eff}} = \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\frac{4t^2}{U} \\left( \\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{4t^2}{U} \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} \\vec{S}_i \\cdot \\vec{S}_j - \\frac{t^2}{U} \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} 1$$\nThe second-order energy correction $E^{(2)}$ is the ground-state expectation value of $H_{\\text{eff}}$. The ground state of this effective Hamiltonian is the ground state of the 1D spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model.
