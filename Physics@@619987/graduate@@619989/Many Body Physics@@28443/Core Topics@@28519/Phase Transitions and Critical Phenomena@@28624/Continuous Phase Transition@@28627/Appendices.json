No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem posed is a standard and fundamental exercise in the Landau theory of continuous phase transitions. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe central principle, as stated in the problem, is that the equilibrium state of the system corresponds to the minimum of the Landau free-energy density, $F(\\phi;T)$, with respect to the order parameter, $\\phi$. The given expression for the free-energy density is\n$$\nF(\\phi;T) = F_{0} + a(T)\\phi^{2} + b\\phi^{4}\n$$\nwhere $F_0$ is a constant background term, $a(T)=a'\\,(T-T_{c})$ with $a'0$, and $b0$.\n\nTo find the value of $\\phi$ that minimizes $F$, we must first find the extrema by taking the first derivative with respect to $\\phi$ and setting it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\phi} = 2a(T)\\phi + 4b\\phi^{3} = 0\n$$\nFactoring this expression gives\n$$\n2\\phi(a(T) + 2b\\phi^{2}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields two possible sets of solutions for the order parameter:\n1. $\\phi = 0$\n2. $a(T) + 2b\\phi^{2} = 0$, which implies $\\phi^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)}{2b}$. This gives non-trivial solutions $\\phi = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{a(T)}{2b}}$, which are real only when $a(T)  0$.\n\nNext, we must determine which of these solutions correspond to a stable minimum. The condition for a stable minimum is that the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the order parameter must be positive:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}F}{\\partial \\phi^{2}} = 2a(T) + 12b\\phi^{2}  0\n$$\nWe analyze the stability of each solution in the two relevant temperature regimes defined by the sign of $a(T)=a'\\,(T-T_{c})$.\n\nCase 1: High-temperature (disordered) phase, $T  T_{c}$.\nIn this regime, $a(T) = a'(T - T_{c})  0$.\n- For the trivial solution $\\phi = 0$, the second derivative is $\\frac{\\partial^{2}F}{\\partial \\phi^{2}}\\Big|_{\\phi=0} = 2a(T)  0$. Thus, $\\phi=0$ is a stable minimum.\n- The non-trivial solutions $\\phi = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{a(T)}{2b}}$ are not real because $a(T)0$.\nTherefore, for $T  T_c$, the unique equilibrium state is $\\phi_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0$.\n\nCase 2: Low-temperature (ordered) phase, $T  T_{c}$.\nIn this regime, $a(T) = a'(T - T_{c})  0$.\n- For the trivial solution $\\phi = 0$, the second derivative is $\\frac{\\partial^{2}F}{\\partial \\phi^{2}}\\Big|_{\\phi=0} = 2a(T)  0$. Thus, $\\phi=0$ corresponds to a local maximum and is an unstable state.\n- For the non-trivial solutions $\\phi^{2} = -\\frac{a(T)}{2b}$, we evaluate the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}F}{\\partial \\phi^{2}} = 2a(T) + 12b\\left(-\\frac{a(T)}{2b}\\right) = 2a(T) - 6a(T) = -4a(T)\n$$\nSince $a(T)  0$ in this regime, the second derivative $-4a(T)$ is strictly positive. Thus, the solutions $\\phi = \\pm\\sqrt{-\\frac{a(T)}{2b}}$ represent two equivalent, stable minima of the free energy. The system spontaneously breaks the $\\phi \\mapsto -\\phi$ symmetry and chooses one of these states.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical exponent $\\beta$, which describes the behavior of the order parameter as the critical temperature is approached from below, i.e., as $T \\to T_{c}^{-}$. For this regime ($T  T_c$), the magnitude of the equilibrium order parameter is\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T) = \\sqrt{-\\frac{a(T)}{2b}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given temperature dependence $a(T)=a'\\,(T-T_{c})$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T) = \\sqrt{-\\frac{a'(T-T_{c})}{2b}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a'}{2b}(T_{c}-T)}\n$$\nThe problem defines the reduced temperature $t = T - T_c$, which means $T_c - T = -t$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\phi_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T)$ gives:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{a'}{2b}(-t)} = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{a'}{2b}}\\right)(-t)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe definition of the critical exponent $\\beta$ is given by the asymptotic relationship $\\phi_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T) \\sim B(-t)^{\\beta}$ for $T \\to T_{c}^{-}$, where $B$ is a constant amplitude. By direct comparison of our derived result with this definition, we have:\n$$\n\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{a'}{2b}}\\right)(-t)^{1/2} \\sim B(-t)^{\\beta}\n$$\nFrom this comparison, we can immediately identify the value of the critical exponent $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis is the mean-field value for the order parameter critical exponent for a transition described by this Landau free energy.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2834621"}, {"introduction": "While powerful, mean-field theory neglects critical fluctuations.
