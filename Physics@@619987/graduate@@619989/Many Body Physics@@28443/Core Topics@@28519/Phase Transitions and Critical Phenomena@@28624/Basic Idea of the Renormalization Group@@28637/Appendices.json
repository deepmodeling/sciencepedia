For a system characterized by a scalar order parameter field $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})$ in $d$ spatial dimensions, the standard Ginzburg-Landau free energy density involves terms like $(\\nabla \\phi)^2$, $\\phi^2$, and $\\phi^4$. The gradient-squared term, $(\\nabla \\phi)^2$, corresponds to short-range interactions and, in momentum space, gives rise to a quadratic term $k^2|\\phi_k|^2$, leading to a free propagator $G(k) \\sim 1/k^2$.\n\nHowever, in certain physical systems, such as those with long-range interactions (e.g., elastic modes in a crystal, unscreened dipolar interactions), the effective energy cost for a spatial fluctuation of wavevector $k$ is not proportional to $k^2$.

We begin at generation $n=0$ with a single directed bond connecting a source node $A$ to a sink node $B$. To obtain generation $n+1$ from generation $n$, we replace every bond in the generation $n$ lattice with a diamond-shaped motif. This motif consists of two new intermediate nodes, $C$ and $D$, and four new directed bonds.

In the infinite-generation limit, each bond is independently present with probability $p$ and absent with probability $1-p$. The connectivity of the lattice is studied using a real-space renormalization group (RG) approach. The RG transformation consists of coarse-graining by replacing a single diamond motif with a single effective bond.
