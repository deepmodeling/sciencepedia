The corresponding entropy density $S_{\\mathrm{eq}} = -\\partial f_{\\mathrm{eq}}/\\partial T$ and heat capacity density $c_{\\mathrm{MF}} = T(\\partial S_{\\mathrm{eq}}/\\partial T)$ are both zero.\n\nFor $T<T_c$, $a(T)<0$. The minimum of $f$ is found by setting $\\partial f/\\partial \\phi = 2a\\phi + 2b\\phi^3 = 0$. This gives the non-trivial solution $\\phi_{\\mathrm{eq}}^2 = -a/b = -a_0 t/b$.\nThe equilibrium free energy density for $T<T_c$ is:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T<T_c) = a\\phi_{\\mathrm{eq}}^2 + \\frac{b}{2}\\phi_{\\mathrm{eq}}^4 = a(-a/b) + \\frac{b}{2}(-a/b)^2 = -\\frac{a^2}{2b}\n$$\nSubstituting $a=a_0 t = a_0(T-T_c)/T_c$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T<T_c) = -\\frac{1}{2b} \\left(\\frac{a_0(T-T_c)}{T_c}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{a_0^2}{2b T_c^2}(T-T_c)^2\n$$\nThe entropy density is $S_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T<T_c) = -\\frac{\\partial f_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial T} = \\frac{a_0^2}{b T_c^2}(T-T_c)$.\nThe mean-field heat capacity density is $c_{\\mathrm{MF}}(T<T_c) = T \\frac{\\partial S_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\partial T} = T \\frac{a_0^2}{b T_c^2}$.\nThe value just below $T_c$ is obtained by setting $T=T_c$:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{MF}}(T\\to T_c^-) = T_c \\frac{a_0^2}{b T_c^2} = \\frac{a_0^2}{b T_c}\n$$\nThe heat capacity jump at $T_c$ is $\\Delta c_{\\mathrm{MF}} = c_{\\mathrm{MF}}(T_c^-) - c_{\\mathrm{MF}}(T_c^+) = \\frac{a_0^2}{b T_c} - 0$:\n$$\n\\Delta c_{\\mathrm{MF}} = \\frac{a_0^2}{b T_c}\n$$\nNow we apply the Ginzburg criterion: $c_{\\mathrm{fl}}^+(t=\\mathrm{Gi}) = \\Delta c_{\\mathrm{MF}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{k_B}{16\\pi} \\left(\\frac{a_0}{c}\\right)^{3/2} (\\mathrm{Gi})^{-1/2} = \\frac{a_0^2}{b T_c}\n$$\nWe solve for $\\mathrm{Gi}$:\n$$\n(\\mathrm{Gi})^{1/2} = \\frac{k_B b T_c}{16\\pi a_0^2} \\left(\\frac{a_0}{c}\\right)^{3/2} = \\frac{k_B b T_c}{16\\pi a_0^2} \\frac{a_0^{3/2}}{c^{3/2}} = \\frac{k_B b T_c}{16\\pi a_0^{1/2} c^{3/2}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives the expression for the Ginzburg number:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Gi} = \\left( \\frac{k_B b T_c}{16\\pi a_0^{1/2} c^{3/2}} \\right)^2 = \\frac{k_B^2 b^2 T_c^2}{256\\pi^2 a_0 c^3}\n$$\nThis quantity is dimensionless, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_B^2 T_c^2 b^2}{256\\pi^2 a_0 c^3}}\n$$", "id": "2834618"}]}
