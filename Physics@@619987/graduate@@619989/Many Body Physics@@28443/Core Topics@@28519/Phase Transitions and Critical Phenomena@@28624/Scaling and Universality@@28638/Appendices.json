Near the critical point, the system's behavior is governed by the Landau free energy density, which, in the mean-field approximation (ignoring spatial fluctuations), is given by:\n$$\nf(\\phi, t, h) = \\frac{a}{2} t \\phi^2 + \\frac{b}{4} \\phi^4 - h \\phi\n$$\nHere, $t = (T - T_c)/T_c$ is the reduced temperature, $h$ is an external field that couples linearly to the order parameter, and $a, b$ are positive phenomenological constants. The equilibrium value of the order parameter $\\phi_0$ is the one that minimizes the free energy density $f$.\n\nThe zero-field susceptibility, $\\chi$, is defined as the response of the order parameter to an infinitesimal external field, evaluated at zero field:\n$$\n\\chi = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial h} \\right)_{h=0}\n$$\nNear the critical point ($t \\to 0$), the susceptibility exhibits a power-law divergence:\n$$\n\\chi(t) \\propto |t|^{-\\gamma}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the critical exponent for the susceptibility. The behavior is described more precisely by introducing amplitudes $\\Gamma_+$ and $\\Gamma_-$ for the phases above and below the critical temperature:\n-   For the high-temperature (disordered) phase ($t > 0$): $\\chi_+(t) = \\Gamma_+ t^{-\\gamma}$ as $t \\to 0^+$.\n-   For the low-temperature (ordered) phase ($t < 0$): $\\chi_-(t) = \\Gamma_- |t|^{-\\gamma}$ as $t \\to 0^-$.\n\nThe ratio of these amplitudes, $R = \\Gamma_+ / \\Gamma_-$, is a universal quantity, meaning it is independent of the microscopic details of the system, and thus independent of the parameters $a$ and $b$.\n\nWithin the framework of this Landau theory, calculate the universal amplitude ratio $R = \\Gamma_+ / \\Gamma_-$.", "solution": "The solution involves calculating the susceptibility in both the high-temperature ($t>0$) and low-temperature ($t<0$) phases and then extracting the corresponding amplitudes to find their ratio.\n\n**1.

High-Temperature Phase ($t > 0$)**\n\nIn the absence of an external field ($h=0$), the equilibrium condition is:\n$$\n\\phi_0 (at + b\\phi_0^2) = 0\n$$\nSince $a > 0$, $b > 0$, and for this phase $t > 0$, the term $(at + b\\phi_0^2)$ is always positive for any real $\\phi_0 \\neq 0$. Thus, the only real solution is $\\phi_0 = 0$. This corresponds to the disordered phase.\n\nNow, we calculate the susceptibility $\\chi_+$ for $t>0$ by substituting $\\phi_0=0$ into our general expression for $\\chi$:\n$$\n\\chi_+(t) = \\frac{1}{at + 3b(0)^2} = \\frac{1}{at}\n$$\nComparing this to the definition $\\chi_+(t) = \\Gamma_+ t^{-\\gamma}$, we identify the mean-field critical exponent $\\gamma = 1$ and the amplitude:\n$$\n\\Gamma_+ = \\frac{1}{a}\n$$\n\n**3. Low-Temperature Phase ($t < 0$)**\n\nLet's define $t = -|t|$ for $t<0$. The equilibrium condition for $h=0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\phi_0 (-a|t| + b\\phi_0^2) = 0\n$$\nThis equation has three real solutions:\n-   $\\phi_0 = 0$\n-   $\\phi_0^2 = \\frac{a|t|}{b} \\implies \\phi_0 = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{a|t|}{b}}$\n\nTo determine which solution corresponds to the stable equilibrium state, we evaluate the free energy density (with $h=0$ and $t=-|t|$) for each case:\n-   For $\\phi_0=0$: $f(0) = 0$.\n-   For $\\phi_0^2 = \\frac{a|t|}{b}$:\n    $$\n    f = \\frac{a}{2}(-|t|)\\left(\\frac{a|t|}{b}\\right) + \\frac{b}{4}\\left(\\frac{a|t|}{b}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{a^2|t|^2}{2b} + \\frac{b}{4}\\frac{a^2|t|^2}{b^2} = -\\frac{a^2|t|^2}{2b} + \\frac{a^2|t|^2}{4b} = -\\frac{a^2|t|^2}{4b}\n    $$\nSince $a>0, b>0$, we have $f < 0$. The non-zero solutions for $\\phi_0$ correspond to a lower free energy, so they represent the stable, ordered phase. We use $\\phi_0^2 = \\frac{a|t|}{b}$ for the susceptibility calculation.\n\nNow, we calculate the susceptibility $\\chi_-$ for $t<0$ by substituting this $\\phi_0^2$ into the general expression:\n$$\n\\chi_-(t) = \\frac{1}{at + 3b\\phi_0^2} = \\frac{1}{a(-|t|) + 3b\\left(\\frac{a|t|}{b}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{-a|t| + 3a|t|} = \\frac{1}{2a|t|}\n$$\nComparing this to the definition $\\chi_-(t) = \\Gamma_- |t|^{-\\gamma}$, we again find $\\gamma=1$ and the amplitude:\n$$\n\\Gamma_- = \\frac{1}{2a}\n$$\n\n**4.
