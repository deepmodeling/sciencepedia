At zero temperature, these pairs condense into a macroscopic quantum state separated from single-particle-like excitations by an energy gap $\\Delta_0$. An external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ affects the superconducting state in two ways: through the orbital motion of electrons (Meissner effect) and through the spin (Zeeman effect).\n\nThis problem focuses on the Zeeman effect, which tends to break Cooper pairs. A spin-up electron has its energy shifted by $+\\mu_B B$ and a spin-down by $-\\mu_B B$, where $\\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. This energy difference makes spin-singlet pairing energetically less favorable. When the magnetic energy becomes comparable to the pairing energy, superconductivity can be destroyed. This is known as the Chandrasekhar-Clogston or paramagnetic limit.\n\nThe behavior of the elementary excitations (quasiparticles) in a superconductor under a magnetic field can be described by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) formalism. The mean-field Hamiltonian for an s-wave superconductor in a uniform magnetic field $B$ along the z-axis is given by:\n$$\nH = \\sum_{k} \\left( (\\xi_k+\\mu_B B) c_{k\\uparrow}^\\dagger c_{k\\uparrow} + (\\xi_k-\\mu_B B) c_{k\\downarrow}^\\dagger c_{k\\downarrow} \\right) - \\sum_k \\left( \\Delta c_{k\\uparrow}^\\dagger c_{-k\\downarrow}^\\dagger + \\Delta^* c_{-k\\downarrow} c_{k\\uparrow} \\right)\n$$\nHere, $c_{k\\sigma}^\\dagger$ and $c_{k\\sigma}$ are creation and annihilation operators for an electron with momentum $k$ and spin $\\sigma \\in \\{\\uparrow, \\downarrow\\}$, $\\xi_k = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} - E_F$ is the single-particle kinetic energy relative to the Fermi energy $E_F$, and $\\Delta$ is the complex superconducting gap parameter, which we can take to be real and positive, $\\Delta > 0$.\n\nBy diagonalizing this Hamiltonian using a Bogoliubov transformation, one can find the energy spectrum of the quasiparticle excitations.

We are given the mean-field Hamiltonian and are told to assume the gap parameter $\\Delta$ is a constant $\\Delta_0$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian couples particle and hole states. To find the excitation spectrum, we diagonalize it. The Hamiltonian can be structured in a matrix form using Nambu-Gorkov spinors. The pairing term couples the state $(k, \\uparrow)$ with $(-k, \\downarrow)$ and the state $(k, \\downarrow)$ with $(-k, \\uparrow)$. Due to this structure, the Hamiltonian decouples into independent $2 \\times 2$ blocks for each pair of coupled states.\n\nLet's first consider the subspace spanned by the basis vectors corresponding to creating an electron $(k, \\uparrow)$ and a hole $(-k, \\downarrow)$. We use the Nambu spinor $\\Psi_{k, \\uparrow}^\\dagger = (c_{k\\uparrow}^\\dagger, c_{-k\\downarrow})$. The part of the Hamiltonian acting on this subspace is\n$$\nH_{k, \\uparrow} = \\begin{pmatrix} c_{k\\uparrow}^\\dagger & c_{-k\\downarrow} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\xi_k + \\mu_B B & -\\Delta_0 \\\\ -\\Delta_0 & -(\\xi_{-k} - \\mu_B B) \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} c_{k\\uparrow} \\\\ c_{-k\\downarrow}^\\dagger \\end{pmatrix} + (\\xi_{-k} - \\mu_B B).\n$$\nWe assume inversion symmetry, so $\\xi_{-k} = \\xi_k$.

The possible positive excitation energies are given by $E_k^0 + \\mu_B B$ and $|E_k^0 - \\mu_B B|$.\n\nThe superconducting energy gap, $E_{gap}$, is the minimum energy required to create any quasiparticle excitation. To find it, we must find the minimum of the positive excitation energies over all possible momenta $k$. The energy $E_k^0 = \\sqrt{\\xi_k^2 + \\Delta_0^2}$ has a minimum value when $\\xi_k = 0$ (i.e., for electrons at the Fermi surface), where it equals $\\Delta_0$.\n\nLet's find the minimum of each branch of positive energies:\n1. Minimum of $E_k^0 + \\mu_B B$: This occurs at $\\xi_k=0$, and the minimum value is $\\Delta_0 + \\mu_B B$.\n2. Minimum of $|E_k^0 - \\mu_B B|$: This also occurs at $\\xi_k=0$, and the minimum value is $|\\Delta_0 - \\mu_B B|$.\n\nThe overall energy gap $E_{gap}$ is the minimum of these two values:\n$$\nE_{gap} = \\min(\\Delta_0 + \\mu_B B, |\\Delta_0 - \\mu_B B|)\n$$\nSince $\\Delta_0 > 0$ and we consider $B \\ge 0$, $\\Delta_0 + \\mu_B B$ is always positive and larger than or equal to $|\\Delta_0 - \\mu_B B|$. Therefore, the energy gap is:\n$$\nE_{gap} = |\\Delta_0 - \\mu_B B|\n$$\nThe superconducting state is destroyed when the energy gap closes, i.e., when $E_{gap} = 0$. The critical magnetic field $B_c$ is the field at which this occurs:\n$$\n|\\Delta_0 - \\mu_B B_c| = 0\n$$\nThis implies:\n$$\n\\mu_B B_c = \\Delta_0\n$$\nSolving for the critical magnetic field $B_c$, we get:\n$$\nB_c = \\frac{\\Delta_0}{\\mu_B}\n$$\nThis is the Chandrasekhar-Clogston critical magnetic field.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\Delta_0}{\\mu_B}}\n$$", "id": "1100145"}, {"introduction": "This final practice problem is a comprehensive exercise that demonstrates how the Bogoliubov transformation fits into a larger framework for solving celebrated models in quantum magnetism.
