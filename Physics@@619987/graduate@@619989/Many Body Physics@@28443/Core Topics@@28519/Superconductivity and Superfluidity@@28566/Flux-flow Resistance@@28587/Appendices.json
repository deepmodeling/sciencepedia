The magnitude of the field is such that it places the superconductor in the mixed state, where the lower critical field $H_{c1}$ is less than $H$, and $H$ is less than the upper critical field $H_{c2}$. In this state, the magnetic field penetrates the material in the form of quantized flux tubes known as Abrikosov vortices, each carrying a single magnetic flux quantum, $\\Phi_0$. The average magnetic induction inside the material is $\\vec{B}$. A transport current with a uniform density $\\vec{J}$ is then passed through the superconductor in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder and thus perpendicular to $\\vec{B}$.\n\nThe transport current exerts a Lorentz force on each vortex line. This force causes the vortices to move. The motion of the vortices is opposed by a viscous drag force, which for a single vortex of unit length is given by $\\vec{F}_d = -\\eta \\vec{v}_L$, where $\\eta$ is the viscous drag coefficient and $\\vec{v}_L$ is the vortex velocity. Assume the system reaches a steady state where the Lorentz force on a vortex is perfectly balanced by the drag force. The motion of these magnetic flux lines, in turn, induces an electric field within the superconductor.\n\nBased on this model of vortex dynamics, derive an expression for the resulting electrical resistivity, $\\rho$, often called the flux-flow resistivity.
