It represents a standard calculation in the theory of interacting electron systems, specifically within the framework of Landau's Fermi liquid theory as described by many-body Green's functions.

Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe retarded single-particle Green's function, $G^{R}(k,\\omega)$, is given by the Dyson equation:\n$$G^{R}(k,\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_{k} - \\Sigma^{R}(k,\\omega)}$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_{k} = \\frac{k^{2} - k_{F}^{2}}{2 m}$ is the non-interacting dispersion relative to the Fermi energy, and $\\Sigma^{R}(k,\\omega)$ is the retarded self-energy. A quasiparticle is defined as a pole of the Green's function. Ignoring the imaginary part of the self-energy as instructed, the quasiparticle energy $\\omega_{k}^{\\ast}$ is the real solution to the equation where the denominator vanishes:\n$$\\omega_{k}^{\\ast} - \\epsilon_{k} - \\operatorname{Re}\\,\\Sigma^{R}(k, \\omega_{k}^{\\ast}) = 0$$\n\nThe problem specifies that the chemical potential has been absorbed such that $\\epsilon_{k_{F}} = 0$. By definition, the quasiparticle energy at the Fermi surface must be zero, so $\\omega_{k_{F}}^{\\ast} = 0$. Substituting $k=k_{F}$ and $\\omega=\\omega_{k_{F}}^{\\ast}=0$ into the pole equation gives:\n$$0 - \\epsilon_{k_{F}} - \\operatorname{Re}\\,\\Sigma^{R}(k_{F}, 0) = 0$$\nGiven $\\epsilon_{k_{F}} = (\\frac{k_F^2 - k_F^2}{2m}) = 0$, and using the provided expansion for the self-energy, $\\operatorname{Re}\\,\\Sigma^{R}(k_{F}, 0) = \\Sigma_{0}$, we find that $\\Sigma_{0} = 0$. Thus, the self-energy expansion near the Fermi surface is:\n$$\\operatorname{Re}\\,\\Sigma^{R}(k,\\omega) = a\\,\\omega + b\\,\\epsilon_{k} + c\\,\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{\\Omega} + d\\,\\frac{\\epsilon_{k}^{2}}{E} + e\\,\\frac{\\omega\\,\\epsilon_{k}}{W}$$\n\nFirst, we derive the quasiparticle residue $Z_{k_{F}}$.

We must evaluate the Fourier transform of the disorder correlator:\n$$ \\langle V(\\mathbf{q}) V^{*}(\\mathbf{q}') \\rangle = \\int d^{2}r \\int d^{2}r' e^{-i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} e^{i\\mathbf{q}'\\cdot\\mathbf{r}'} \\langle V(\\mathbf{r})V(\\mathbf{r}') \\rangle $$\n$$ = \\int d^{2}r \\int d^{2}r' e^{-i\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} e^{i\\mathbf{q}'\\cdot\\mathbf{r}'} \\Delta \\delta^{(2)}(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}') = \\Delta \\int d^{2}r e^{-i(\\mathbf{q}-\\mathbf{q}')\\cdot\\mathbf{r}} $$\n$$ = \\Delta (2\\pi)^{2} \\delta^{(2)}(\\mathbf{q}-\\mathbf{q}') $$\nThis implies that $\\langle |V(\\mathbf{q})|^{2} \\rangle = \\Delta$. This quantity is independent of the momentum transfer $\\mathbf{q}$. As a result, the self-energy expression's right-hand side is independent of the external momentum $\\mathbf{k}$:\n$$ \\Sigma^{R}(E) = \\int \\frac{d^{2}k'}{(2\\pi)^{2}} \\Delta G^{R}(E, \\mathbf{k'}) $$\nThus, the self-energy is momentum-independent, $\\Sigma^{R}(E, \\mathbf{k}) \\equiv \\Sigma^{R}(E)$, due to the short-range (white-noise) nature of the disorder potential. Substituting the expression for $G^{R}(E, \\mathbf{k'})$, we obtain the final self-consistent equation:\n$$ \\Sigma^{R}(E) = \\Delta \\int \\frac{d^{2}k'}{(2\\pi)^{2}} \\frac{1}{E - \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k'^{2}}{2m} - \\Sigma^{R}(E) + i\\eta} $$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of $\\Gamma$ and the Density of States (DOS)\n\nLet us define the real and imaginary parts of the self-energy as $\\Sigma^{R}(E) = \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R}(E) - i\\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma \\equiv -\\operatorname{Im}\\Sigma^{R}(E) > 0$. Taking the imaginary part of the SCBA equation:\n$$ \\operatorname{Im}\\Sigma^{R}(E) = \\Delta \\int \\frac{d^{2}k'}{(2\\pi)^{2}} \\operatorname{Im} \\left( \\frac{1}{E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R}(E) - \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k'^{2}}{2m} + i\\Gamma} \\right) $$\nUsing the identity $\\operatorname{Im}[(A+iB)^{-1}] = -B/(A^{2}+B^{2})$, we get:\n$$ -\\Gamma = \\Delta \\int \\frac{d^{2}k'}{(2\\pi)^{2}} \\frac{-\\Gamma}{\\left(E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R}(E) - \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k'^{2}}{2m}\\right)^{2} + \\Gamma^{2}} $$\nAssuming $\\Gamma \\neq 0$, we can divide by $-\\Gamma$:\n$$ 1 = \\Delta \\int \\frac{d^{2}k'}{(2\\pi)^{2}} \\frac{1}{\\left(E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R}(E) - \\frac{\\hbar^{2}k'^{2}}{2m}\\right)^{2} + \\Gamma^{2}} $$\nTo evaluate the integral, we convert from an integral over momentum $\\mathbf{k'}$ to an integral over energy $\\epsilon' = \\hbar^{2}k'^{2}/(2m)$. We use $d^{2}k' = 2\\pi k' dk'$ and $d\\epsilon' = (\\hbar^{2}k'/m)dk'$, which gives $k'dk' = (m/\\hbar^{2})d\\epsilon'$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\int \\frac{d^{2}k'}{(2\\pi)^{2}} f(E_{\\mathbf{k'}}) \\to \\int_{0}^{E_{c}} d\\epsilon' \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^{2}} f(\\epsilon') $$\nwhere we have used the fact that the two-dimensional density of states for a clean system is $\\rho_{0} = m/(2\\pi\\hbar^{2})$. The equation for $\\Gamma$ is now:\n$$ 1 = \\Delta \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^{2}} \\int_{0}^{E_{c}} \\frac{d\\epsilon'}{\\left(E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R}(E) - \\epsilon'\\right)^{2} + \\Gamma^{2}} $$\nLet $u = \\epsilon' - (E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R}(E))$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\int_{-(E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R})}^{E_{c}-(E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R})} \\frac{du}{u^{2}+\\Gamma^{2}} = \\left[\\frac{1}{\\Gamma}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{u}{\\Gamma}\\right)\\right]_{-(E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R})}^{E_{c}-(E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R})} $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma} \\left[ \\arctan\\left(\\frac{E_{c} - E + \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R}}{\\Gamma}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R}}{\\Gamma}\\right) \\right] $$\nWe consider the specified limit $0 < E \\ll E_{c}$. For weak disorder, $\\Gamma$ is small, and so is the energy shift $\\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R}$. In this regime, the arguments of the arctan functions are large: $(E - \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R})/\\Gamma \\to +\\infty$ and $(E_{c} - E + \\operatorname{Re}\\Sigma^{R})/\\Gamma \\to +\\infty$. Thus, $\\arctan(x) \\to \\pi/2$ for $x \\to \\infty$. The term in brackets becomes $\\pi/2 + \\pi/2 = \\pi$. The integral evaluates to $\\pi/\\Gamma$. Substituting this back:\n$$ 1 \\approx \\Delta \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^{2}} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\Gamma} \\right) = \\frac{m\\Delta}{2\\hbar^{2}\\Gamma} $$\nThis yields an energy-independent broadening:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{m\\Delta}{2\\hbar^{2}} $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the disorder-broadened density of states per unit area, $\\rho(E)$. It is given by:\n$$ \\rho(E) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\operatorname{Im} \\left( \\int \\frac{d^{2}k}{(2\\pi)^{2}} G^{R}(E, \\mathbf{k}) \\right) $$\nFrom the SCBA equation, we have a direct relation for the integral: $\\int \\frac{d^{2}k}{(2\\pi)^{2}} G^{R}(E, \\mathbf{k}) = \\Sigma^{R}(E)/\\Delta$. Therefore,\n$$ \\rho(E) = -\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\operatorname{Im} \\left( \\frac{\\Sigma^{R}(E)}{\\Delta} \\right) = -\\frac{\\operatorname{Im}\\Sigma^{R}(E)}{\\pi\\Delta} = \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\pi\\Delta} $$\nTo evaluate this, we can substitute the expression for $\\Gamma$ we just found:\n$$ \\rho(E) = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{m\\Delta}{2\\hbar^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^{2}} $$\nThis shows that in the SCBA and for energies well inside the band ($0 < E \\ll E_{c}$), the disorder-averaged density of states is constant and equal to the value of the clean $2$D system.\n\nFinally, the problem asks to use these results to obtain $\\Gamma$. We have established two key results: $\\rho(E) = \\Gamma/(\\pi\\Delta)$ and the evaluation that $\\rho(E) = m/(2\\pi\\hbar^{2})$. Equating these two expressions for the density of states provides a self-consistent way to determine $\\Gamma$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\pi\\Delta} = \\frac{m}{2\\pi\\hbar^{2}} $$\nSolving for $\\Gamma$, we obtain the final expression for the disorder-induced broadening:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{m\\Delta}{2\\hbar^{2}} $$\nThis expression has units of energy, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{m\\Delta}{2\\hbar^2}}\n$$", "id": "2813708"}]}
