The average concentration $\\bar{c}_{num}$ corresponds to the solubility at the surface of a \"critical radius\" droplet, $R_c$, for which $dR/dt=0$.\n$$\nc_{s,num}(R) = c_{s,num}(\\infty)\\left(1+\\frac{2\\gamma\\Omega}{k_B T R}\\right)\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\n\\bar{c}_{num} = c_{s,num}(R_c) = c_{s,num}(\\infty)\\left(1+\\frac{2\\gamma\\Omega}{k_B T R_c}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $dR/dt$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{D\\Omega c_{s,num}(\\infty)}{R} \\left[ \\left(1+\\frac{2\\gamma\\Omega}{k_B T R}\\right) - \\left(1+\\frac{2\\gamma\\Omega}{k_B T R_c}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\frac{2D\\gamma\\Omega^2 c_{s,num}(\\infty)}{k_B T R}\\left(\\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{1}{R_c}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation describes the growth ($R > R_c$) or dissolution ($R < R_c$) of a single droplet.\n\n**2.

The dispersed phase is characterized by surface tension $\\gamma$, molar volume $v_m$, and molar solubility in the continuous phase $c_s$ at planar interface. The continuous phase allows diffusion of the dispersed phase molecules with diffusion coefficient $D$, and the system is maintained at absolute temperature $T$. Assume quasi-steady diffusion so that the molar concentration field $c(\\mathbf{x})$ in the continuous phase satisfies the Laplace equation $\\nabla^2 c = 0$ at all points not on droplet surfaces.

For an isolated droplet in a spatially uniform far-field concentration $c_\\infty$, the radial flux $J_i$ onto droplet $i$ is related to the concentration difference by a quasi-static boundary layer argument: the total molar flux onto its surface is $J_i = 4 \\pi D R_i \\left(c_\\infty - c_{\\mathrm{eq}}(R_i)\\right)$. The droplet radius changes according to mass balance, $dR_i/dt = \\left(D v_m / R_i\\right) \\left(c_\\infty - c_{\\mathrm{eq}}(R_i)\\right)$. In a many-droplet configuration, the far-field concentration experienced by a droplet is not simply $c_\\infty$; it is perturbed by the presence of other droplets.

Truncated Multipole Model\n\nThis model accounts for the specific geometric arrangement of the droplets. The concentration field $c(\\mathbf{x})$ is approximated by a superposition of fields from effective monopoles ($a_j$) and dipoles ($\\mathbf{p}_j$) at each droplet center $\\mathbf{x}_j$. Near droplet $i$, the \"external\" field from all other sources is approximated as $c(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx c_{\\mathrm{ext},i} + \\mathbf{G}_{\\mathrm{ext},i} \\cdot (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_i)$. Using the analogy to a conducting sphere in electrostatics, the multipole coefficients are chosen to satisfy the surface boundary condition:\n$$\na_i = R_i (c_{\\mathrm{eq}}(R_i) - c_{\\mathrm{ext},i})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{p}_i = R_i^3 \\mathbf{G}_{\\mathrm{ext},i}\n$$\nThe growth rate of droplet $i$ is $dR_i/dt = (D v_m / R_i) (c_{\\mathrm{ext},i} - c_{\\mathrm{eq}}(R_i))$. This simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{dR_i}{dt}\\right)_{\\mathrm{multi}} = -\\frac{D v_m a_i}{R_i^2}\n$$\nThe system of equations for $\\{a_i, \\mathbf{p}_i\\}$ is closed by enforcing mass conservation, which requires the sum of all fluxes to be zero. Since the molar flux into droplet $i$ is $J_i = 4 \\pi D a_i$, conservation requires $\\sum_{i=1}^N a_i = 0$. This condition allows the unknown background concentration $c_\\infty$ to be determined. The resulting coupled equations for the multipole coefficients must be solved self-consistently, for which a fixed-point iteration algorithm is used.\n\n### 3. Computational Implementation\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  **Generate Configuration**: Generate droplet radii and positions according to the case specifications, ensuring no overlaps.\n2.  **LSW Calculation**: Compute the critical radius $R_c$ and then the LSW growth rate for each droplet. Average the results.\n3.  **Multipole Calculation**: Initialize multipole coefficients to zero. Iterate several times, updating the background concentration $c_\\infty$ and the multipole coefficients $\\{a_i, \\mathbf{p}_i\\}$ at each step until self-consistency is approached. Use the final coefficients to compute the multipole growth rates and their average.\n4.  **Report Results**: Collect and format the six average growth rates as specified.\n\nFor the monodisperse case (Case C), all $R_i$ are identical. This implies $R_c = R_i$, leading to $(dR_i/dt)_{\\mathrm{LSW}} = 0$ for all droplets. For the multipole model, while individual droplets may have non-zero growth rates due to local asymmetries, the condition $\\sum a_i = 0$ and the fact that all radii are equal ensures that the average growth rate, $\\overline{dR/dt} = (1/N)\\sum (-D v_m a_i / R_i^2)$, is also zero.",
