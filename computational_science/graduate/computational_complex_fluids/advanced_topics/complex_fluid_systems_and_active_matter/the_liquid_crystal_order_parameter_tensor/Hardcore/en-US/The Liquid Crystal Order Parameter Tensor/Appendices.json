We will now address the three parts of the problem in order.\n\n$1.$ To find the stationary solutions for the scalar order parameter $S$, we must find the values of $S$ that extremize the free-energy density $f_b(S)$. This is accomplished by solving the stationarity condition $\\frac{\\partial f_b}{\\partial S} = 0$.\n\nThe first derivative of $f_b(S)$ with respect to $S$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_b}{\\partial S} = A S - B S^2 + C S^3\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero gives the equation for the stationary points:\n$$\nA S - B S^2 + C S^3 = 0\n$$\n$$\nS(A - B S + C S^2) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields one immediate solution:\n$$\nS_0 = 0\n$$\nThis solution corresponds to the isotropic phase, where there is no long-range orientational order.\n\nThe other solutions, corresponding to the nematic phase, are the roots of the quadratic equation:\n$$\nC S^2 - B S + A = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $S = \\frac{-(-B) \\pm \\sqrt{(-B)^2 - 4AC}}{2C}$, we find two nematic solutions:\n$$\nS_{\\pm} = \\frac{B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2C}\n$$\nThese two solutions, $S_+$ and $S_-$, are real and distinct provided that the discriminant is positive, i.e., $B^2 - 4AC  0$, or $A  \\frac{B^2}{4C}$. If $B^2 - 4AC = 0$, the two solutions coalesce into a single solution $S = \\frac{B}{2C}$. If $B^2 - 4AC  0$, there are no real nematic solutions.\n\nThus, there are three stationary solutions for $S$: $S_0 = 0$, $S_+ = \\frac{B + \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2C}$, and $S_- = \\frac{B - \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2C}$.\n\n$2.$ To classify the stationary solutions by their local stability, we use the second derivative test. A solution is a local minimum (stable) if $\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2}  0$ and a local maximum (unstable) if $\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2}  0$.\n\nThe second derivative of $f_b(S)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2} = A - 2 B S + 3 C S^2\n$$\nWe now evaluate this expression at each stationary point.\n\nIsotropic solution ($S_0 = 0$):\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2}\\right|_{S=0} = A\n$$\n- If $A  0$, the isotropic solution $S_0=0$ is a local minimum and thus is locally stable.\n- If $A  0$, the isotropic solution $S_0=0$ is a local maximum and thus is unstable.\n- If $A = 0$, the stability is marginal, and this point marks the limit of stability for the isotropic phase.\n\nNematic solutions ($S_{\\pm}$):\nThe nematic solutions satisfy the equation $C S^2 - B S + A = 0$, which can be rearranged to give $A = B S - C S^2$. Substituting this into the second derivative expression simplifies the analysis:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2} = (B S - C S^2) - 2 B S + 3 C S^2 = 2 C S^2 - B S = S(2CS - B)\n$$\nFor the solutions $S_{\\pm}$, we have $2CS_{\\pm} - B = 2C\\left(\\frac{B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2C}\\right) - B = \\pm\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}$.\nSo, the second derivative at $S_{\\pm}$ is:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2}\\right|_{S=S_{\\pm}} = S_{\\pm} (\\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC})\n$$\nWe assume $B0$ and $C0$. The nematic solutions are real for $A \\le \\frac{B^2}{4C}$.\n- For the solution $S_+ = \\frac{B + \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2C}$: Since $\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}  B$ for $A0$, and even for $A0$ the term $B$ is positive, $S_+$ is always positive. The stability is determined by $\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2}\\right|_{S=S_+} = S_+ (+\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC})$. As long as $B^2 - 4AC  0$, this is positive. Therefore, $S_+$ corresponds to a local minimum (stable nematic state).\n- For the solution $S_- = \\frac{B - \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2C}$:\n  - If $0  A  \\frac{B^2}{4C}$, then $0  \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}  B$, which implies $S_-0$. The stability is given by $\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2}\\right|_{S=S_-} = S_- (-\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC})$, which is negative. Thus, $S_-$ is a local maximum (unstable). It represents the energy barrier between the isotropic and nematic minima.\n  - If $A  0$, then $\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}  B$, which implies $S_-  0$. The stability is given by $\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2}\\right|_{S=S_-} = S_- (-\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC})$. Since both terms are negative, their product is positive. Thus, for $A0$, $S_-$ is a local minimum. However, a negative scalar order parameter is typically considered unphysical in this context, although it is a valid mathematical solution. The stable physical nematic state is $S_+$.\n\n$3.$ To determine the global minimum and the transition conditions, we compare the free-energy values of the stable minima, specifically the isotropic minimum $S=0$ and the stable nematic minimum $S=S_+$.\n\nThe free energy of the isotropic state is $f_b(0) = 0$.\nThe system will favor the nematic phase when $f_b(S_+)  f_b(0)$, i.e., $f_b(S_+)  0$. The first-order phase transition occurs under the coexistence condition where the two phases have equal free energy:\n$$\nf_b(S_+) = f_b(0) = 0\n$$\nSince $S_+ \\neq 0$, the equation $f_b(S_+) = \\frac{1}{2} A S_+^2 - \\frac{1}{3} B S_+^3 + \\frac{1}{4} C S_+^4 = 0$ can be divided by $S_+^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} A - \\frac{1}{3} B S_+ + \\frac{1}{4} C S_+^2 = 0\n$$\nWe must solve this simultaneously with the stationarity condition for $S_+$: $C S_+^2 - B S_+ + A = 0$.\nLet's eliminate $A$. From the second equation, $A = B S_+ - C S_+^2$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} (B S_+ - C S_+^2) - \\frac{1}{3} B S_+ + \\frac{1}{4} C S_+^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{B}{2} - \\frac{B}{3}\\right)S_+ + \\left(-\\frac{C}{2} + \\frac{C}{4}\\right)S_+^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{B}{6}S_+ - \\frac{C}{4}S_+^2 = 0\n$$\nSince $S_+ \\neq 0$, we divide by $S_+$ to get $\\frac{B}{6} - \\frac{C}{4}S_+ = 0$, which yields the order parameter at coexistence:\n$$\nS_{+,coex} = \\frac{4B}{6C} = \\frac{2B}{3C}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $A$:\n$$\nA_{coex} = B\\left(\\frac{2B}{3C}\\right) - C\\left(\\frac{2B}{3C}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2B^2}{3C} - \\frac{4B^2}{9C} = \\frac{6B^2 - 4B^2}{9C} = \\frac{2B^2}{9C}\n$$\nThis is the condition for coexistence. For $A  A_{coex}$, the isotropic state is the global minimum. For $A  A_{coex}$, the nematic state is the global minimum.\n\nThe spinodal conditions mark the limits of local stability (metastability):\n- The isotropic spinodal is where the isotropic phase becomes unstable. This occurs when $\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 f_b}{\\partial S^2}\\right|_{S=0} = A = 0$. So, $A_{spin,iso} = 0$.\n- The nematic spinodal is where the nematic minimum ceases to exist. This occurs when the discriminant of the quadratic for S becomes zero, $B^2 - 4AC = 0$. This gives $A_{spin,nem} = \\frac{B^2}{4C}$.\n\nIn summary, for $B0, C0$, as $A$ decreases:\n- For $A  \\frac{B^2}{4C}$: Only the isotropic minimum exists (stable absolute minimum).\n- For $\\frac{2B^2}{9C}  A  \\frac{B^2}{4C}$: The isotropic state is the global minimum; the nematic state ($S_+$) is a metastable local minimum.\n- At $A = \\frac{2B^2}{9C}$: Isotropic-nematic coexistence (first-order phase transition).\n- For $0  A  \\frac{2B^2}{9C}$: The nematic state is the global minimum; the isotropic state is a metastable local minimum.\n- At $A=0$: The isotropic state loses its local stability.\n- For $A  0$: The nematic state is the global minimum; the isotropic state is an unstable maximum.\n\nThis completes the analysis required by the problem.

Scaling Argument\n\nThe core of a defect is a region where the nematic order is disrupted to avoid a singularity in the director field, which would lead to an infinite gradient energy. Inside the core, the order parameter magnitude is suppressed, approaching zero. This suppression occurs over a characteristic length scale, $\\ell$. We can estimate $\\ell$ by balancing the energetic cost of creating this disordered core against the energetic gain of smoothing out the gradients.\n\nThe total free energy is minimized at equilibrium. The core size $\\ell$ will adjust to a value where the contributions from the bulk and gradient energy densities are comparable.\n\nLet $Q_{val}$ be the characteristic magnitude of the components of the order parameter tensor $Q_{ij}$ in the bulk nematic phase, far from the defect core. Inside the core, the order parameter vanishes, i.e., $Q_{ij} \\approx 0$. The transition from $Q_{val}$ to $0$ occurs over the distance $\\ell$.\n\nThe bulk energy density term, $f_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = \\frac{A}{2} \\mathrm{tr}(Q^{2})$, represents the energy penalty for deviating from the preferred ordered state. In this problem, it's the cost of being in the isotropic state ($Q_{ij}=0$) inside the core. Assuming the minimum free energy of the nematic state is zero, the cost density to be in the isotropic state is associated with the value of $Q_{ij}$ in the bulk. We estimate the bulk energy density cost within the core as:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{bulk}} \\sim A \\, \\mathrm{tr}(Q^{2}) \\sim A \\, Q_{val}^{2}\n$$\nThis is the energy cost per unit volume to have a disordered core.\n\nThe gradient energy density term, $f_{\\mathrm{grad}} = \\frac{L_{1}}{2} \\partial_{k} Q_{ij} \\partial_{k} Q_{ij}$, represents the energy cost associated with spatial variations of the order parameter. In the transition region around the core, the order parameter changes by an amount $\\Delta Q_{ij} \\sim Q_{val}$ over a length scale $\\ell$. The gradient can be estimated as:\n$$\n|\\partial_{k} Q_{ij}| \\sim \\frac{\\Delta Q_{ij}}{\\ell} \\sim \\frac{Q_{val}}{\\ell}\n$$\nTherefore, the gradient energy density in this region scales as:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{grad}} \\sim L_{1} (\\partial_{k} Q_{ij})^{2} \\sim L_{1} \\left( \\frac{Q_{val}}{\\ell} \\right)^{2}\n$$\n\nThe characteristic core size $\\ell$ is found by balancing these two competing energy density contributions. A larger core would have a high bulk energy cost, while a smaller core would have a high gradient energy cost. The minimum total energy is achieved when these two are of the same order of magnitude:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{bulk}} \\approx f_{\\mathrm{grad}}\n$$\n$$\nA \\, Q_{val}^{2} \\approx L_{1} \\frac{Q_{val}^{2}}{\\ell^{2}}\n$$\nThe characteristic order parameter magnitude $Q_{val}^{2}$ cancels from both sides of the relation.

We need to construct a quantity with units of length from the given parameters $A$ and $L_{1}$.\n\nThe free energy functional $F$ has units of energy, which we denote as $[E]$. The integration volume element $\\mathrm{d}V$ has units of length cubed, $[L]^{3}$. Therefore, the free energy density, $f = f_{\\mathrm{bulk}} + f_{\\mathrm{grad}}$, must have units of energy per volume:\n$$\n[f] = \\frac{[E]}{[L]^{3}} = [E][L]^{-3}\n$$\nThe order parameter $Q_{ij}$ is given to be dimensionless, so $[Q_{ij}] = 1$.\n\nFrom the bulk energy density expression, $f_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = \\frac{A}{2} \\mathrm{tr}(Q^{2})$, we can determine the dimensions of $A$:\n$$\n[A] = \\frac{[f_{\\mathrm{bulk}}]}{[\\mathrm{tr}(Q^{2})]} = \\frac{[E][L]^{-3}}{1} = [E][L]^{-3}\n$$\n\nFrom the gradient energy density expression, $f_{\\mathrm{grad}} = \\frac{L_{1}}{2} \\partial_{k} Q_{ij} \\partial_{k} Q_{ij}$, we determine the dimensions of $L_{1}$. The gradient operator $\\partial_{k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k}$ has dimensions of inverse length, $[L]^{-1}$. The term $\\partial_{k} Q_{ij} \\partial_{k} Q_{ij}$ (with implicit summation over indices) has dimensions of $([L]^{-1})^{2} = [L]^{-2}$.\n$$\n[L_{1}] = \\frac{[f_{\\mathrm{grad}}]}{[(\\partial_{k} Q_{ij})^{2}]} = \\frac{[E][L]^{-3}}{[L]^{-2}} = [E][L]^{-1}\n$$\nNote that units of energy per length are units of force, consistent with $L_{1}$ being an elastic constant.\n\nWe now seek a combination $\\ell \\propto L_{1}^{\\alpha} A^{\\beta}$ that has units of length, $[L]^{1}$.\n$$\n[L]^{1} = ([L_{1}])^{\\alpha} ([A])^{\\beta} = ([E][L]^{-1})^{\\alpha} ([E][L]^{-3})^{\\beta}\n$$\n$$\n[L]^{1} = [E]^{\\alpha + \\beta} [L]^{-\\alpha - 3\\beta}\n$$\nEquating the exponents for each fundamental dimension (energy $[E]$ and length $[L]$) gives a system of linear equations for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n1. For $[E]$: $\\alpha + \\beta = 0$\n2. For $[L]$: $-\\alpha - 3\\beta = 1$\n\nFrom equation (1), we have $\\alpha = -\\beta$. Substituting this into equation (2):\n$$\n-(-\\beta) - 3\\beta = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\beta - 3\\beta = 1\n$$\n$$\n-2\\beta = 1 \\implies \\beta = -\\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nConsequently, $\\alpha = -(-\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus, the characteristic length $\\ell$ must be proportional to $L_{1}^{1/2} A^{-1/2}$.\n$$\n\\ell \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{L_{1}}{A}}\n$$\nBoth the scaling argument and dimensional analysis lead to the same functional form for the characteristic core size. The final estimate, neglecting any dimensionless prefactors of order unity, is given by this expression.",
