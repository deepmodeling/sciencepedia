Partition of Unity (Zeroth Moment): $\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\phi_4(r - k) = 1$ for any $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n2.  First Moment Condition: $\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} (k - r) \\phi_4(r - k) = 0$ for any $r \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThese properties of the one-dimensional kernel extend to the two-dimensional tensor-product weighting function, $W(\\mathbf{X}_q, \\mathbf{x}_{ij}) = \\phi_4(\\frac{X_{qx}}{h} - i) \\phi_4(\\frac{X_{qy}}{h} - j)$.\nThe sum of weights is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} W(\\mathbf{X}_q, \\mathbf{x}_{ij}) = \\left(\\sum_i \\phi_4\\left(\\frac{X_{qx}}{h} - i\\right)\\right) \\left(\\sum_j \\phi_4\\left(\\frac{X_{qy}}{h} - j\\right)\\right) = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1\n$$\nThe first moment of the interpolation scheme is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} (\\mathbf{x}_{ij} - \\mathbf{X}_q) W(\\mathbf{X}_q, \\mathbf{x}_{ij}) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis is because, for the x-component for instance, we have:\n$$\n\\sum_{i,j} (ih - X_{qx}) W = h \\sum_i \\left(i - \\frac{X_{qx}}{h}\\right) \\phi_4\\left(\\frac{X_{qx}}{h} - i\\right) \\sum_j \\phi_4\\left(\\frac{X_{qy}}{h} - j\\right)\n$$\nThe first sum is zero due to the first moment condition, and the second sum is one. A similar argument holds for the y-component.\n\nThe given Eulerian velocity field is $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = (2x - y, -x + 3y)$. This is a linear function of the spatial coordinates $(x,y)$.

Therefore, the computationally intensive summation is unnecessary. We can find the required velocities by directly evaluating the analytical function $\\mathbf{u}(x,y)$ at each point $\\mathbf{X}_q$.\n\nThe Eulerian velocity field is $\\mathbf{u}(x,y) = (u_x, u_y) = (2x - y, -x + 3y)$.\n\n1.

Peskin.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for an analysis of a trade-off between two competing numerical errors governed by a single parameter, $\\Delta s/h$. This is a standard consideration in numerical analysis, and there is a well-established optimal range for this parameter, which can be deduced from the principles provided.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language. It is free from subjective claims or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the trade-off between two competing numerical requirements, both of which are governed by the ratio of the Lagrangian spacing $\\Delta s$ to the Eulerian grid spacing $h$, denoted by $\\Delta s/h$.\n\n**1. Analysis of Leakage**\nLeakage, the non-physical passage of fluid through the immersed boundary, is directly related to how well the discrete set of Lagrangian points and their associated smoothed delta functions represent a continuous, impermeable barrier. The weight function, $W(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{k} \\delta_h(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{X}_k)\\, \\Delta s$, is a discrete approximation of the integral $\\int_{\\Gamma} \\delta_h(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{X}(s)) \\, ds = 1$ for a point $\\mathbf{x}$ on the boundary curve $\\Gamma$. For the discrete sum to be a good approximation of this integral (i.e., for $W(\\mathbf{x}) \\approx 1$), the Lagrangian points must be spaced appropriately.\n\nThe standard $4$-point Peskin kernel has a support of width $4h$. This means the function $\\delta_h(\\mathbf{y})$ is non-zero only for arguments $\\mathbf{y}$ whose components lie within $[-2h, 2h]$.\n\n- If $\\Delta s/h$ is too large (e.g., $\\Delta s/h \\gtrsim 2$): The distance between adjacent Lagrangian points, $\\Delta s$, becomes comparable to or larger than the support radius ($2h$) of the kernel. For a point $\\mathbf{x}$ on the membrane located midway between two Lagrangian points, the distance to the nearest point is $\\Delta s/2$. If $\\Delta s/2 > 2h$, then $\\delta_h$ evaluates to zero, leading to $W(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$. More generally, if $\\Delta s$ is large enough, $W(\\mathbf{x})$ will exhibit significant dips below $1$ between Lagrangian points. These \"gaps\" in the discrete representation of the boundary cause leakage. Therefore, to ensure adequate coverage and prevent leakage, $\\Delta s/h$ must not be too large. A value of $\\Delta s/h \\le 1.0$ is generally considered safe.\n\n**2. Analysis of Spurious Force Oscillations**\nSpurious force oscillations are a high-frequency numerical instability. As stated in the problem, they are \"exacerbated when the Lagrangian mesh is excessively refined relative to the Eulerian grid,\" i.e., when $\\Delta s/h \\ll 1$.\n\nThis phenomenon arises from the properties of the composed operator that links Lagrangian forces to Lagrangian velocities. The ill-conditioning mentioned in the problem stems from the near-linear dependence of the basis functions used for spreading/interpolation. When two Lagrangian points, $\\mathbf{X}_k$ and $\\mathbf{X}_{k+1}$, are very close to each other relative to the Eulerian grid spacing ($\\Delta s \\ll h$), the discrete kernel functions centered at these points, $\\delta_h(\\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{X}_k)$ and $\\delta_h(\\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{X}_{k+1})$, become almost indistinguishable from the perspective of the Eulerian grid points $\\mathbf{x}_i$. A small change in position from $\\mathbf{X}_k$ to $\\mathbf{X}_{k+1}$ results in a very small change in the vector of kernel values on the grid. This creates near-collinearity in the columns of the discrete spreading operator matrix, which in turn leads to an ill-conditioned system. An ill-conditioned system is highly sensitive to small perturbations (like round-off error or small discretization errors in the fluid velocity), which are amplified into large, high-frequency oscillations in the computed Lagrangian forces. To maintain numerical stability and avoid this ill-conditioning, $\\Delta s/h$ must not be too small. A common practical guideline is to maintain $\\Delta s/h \\ge 0.5$.\n\n**3. Synthesis: The Optimal Range**\nCombining the two analyses reveals a clear trade-off:\n- To prevent leakage, we need $\\Delta s/h \\lesssim 1.0$.\n- To prevent spurious force oscillations, we need $\\Delta s/h \\gtrsim 0.5$.\n\nTherefore, a robust and practical choice for the mesh ratio that balances these competing effects is $\\Delta s/h \\in [0.5, 1.0]$. This range is widely recommended in the IBM literature for the standard $4$-point kernel.\n\n### Option-by-Option Evaluation\n\n**Option A: Choose $\\Delta s/h \\in [0.05,\\,0.2]$ so that the Lagrangian mesh is much finer than the Eulerian grid; this strong oversampling guarantees $W(\\mathbf{x}) \\equiv 1$ and eliminates both leakage and force oscillations for the $4$-point kernel.**\nThis recommendation corresponds to a very small $\\Delta s/h$ ratio. While this strong refinement might improve the approximation of the partition of unity and reduce leakage, it directly enters the regime ($\\Delta s \\ll h$) that is known to cause severe spurious force oscillations due to ill-conditioning. The claim that it eliminates these oscillations is contrary to both the provided problem description and established numerical analysis.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option B: With the $4$-point kernel, select $\\Delta s/h \\in [0.5,\\,1.0]$. If $\\Delta s/h$ is larger, $W(\\mathbf{x})$ departs from unity and leakage appears because kernel supports leave gaps; if $\\Delta s/h$ is much smaller, extensive kernel overlap makes the coupling operator ill-conditioned, amplifying grid-scale force oscillations.**\nThis option correctly identifies both failure modes and their dependence on the mesh ratio. It correctly states that a large $\\Delta s/h$ leads to leakage and a small $\\Delta s/h$ leads to force oscillations. The recommended range, $[0.5, 1.0]$, is precisely the \"rule of thumb\" derived from balancing these two constraints. This statement accurately captures the state-of-the-art understanding of this numerical issue.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Option C: Take $\\Delta s/h \\ge 1.5$ so that neighboring Lagrangian kernels have minimal overlap; this reduces stiffness and suppresses spurious force oscillations, while leakage can be controlled by reducing $\\Delta t$.**\nThe first part of the claim, that a large $\\Delta s/h$ reduces kernel overlap and suppresses force oscillations, is true. However, the second part of the claim is false. Leakage is a spatial discretization error caused by the poor representation of the boundary ($W(\\mathbf{x}) \\ll 1$). Reducing the time step $\\Delta t$ does not remedy this spatial error; it only reduces the volume of fluid that leaks per step, without fixing the underlying porosity of the discrete interface. A ratio of $\\Delta s/h \\ge 1.5$ would create significant gaps and unacceptable leakage.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**Option D: Any $\\Delta s/h$ is acceptable if a broader $6$-point discrete delta is used; the larger support ensures $W(\\mathbf{x})=1$ and prevents both leakage and force oscillations regardless of the Lagrangian spacing.**\nThis option proposes a solution outside the problem's scope (which specifies a $4$-point kernel). Even on its own merits, the claim is too strong and therefore false. While a broader kernel (like a $6$-point one) would allow for a larger $\\Delta s/h$ before leakage becomes an issue, it does not solve the problem of ill-conditioning for very small $\\Delta s/h$. The fundamental issue of near-linear dependence of kernels persists when $\\Delta s \\ll h$. So, it does not prevent force oscillations \"regardless of the Lagrangian spacing.\" Furthermore, it is not guaranteed to produce $W(\\mathbf{x})=1$ exactly.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.",

This self-induced velocity, $\\boldsymbol{U}$, is given by the well-established relation:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{U} = \\frac{1}{6\\pi\\mu w} \\boldsymbol{F}\n$$\nThe mobility of the marker, $M_{\\text{marker}}$, is therefore:\n$$\nM_{\\text{marker}}(w) = \\frac{1}{6\\pi\\mu w}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires us to equate these two mobilities:\n$$\nM_{\\text{marker}}(w) = M_{\\text{sphere}}(a_{\\mathrm{eff}})\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the mobilities yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{6\\pi\\mu w} = \\frac{1}{6\\pi\\mu a_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nThis leads to a direct and simple relationship between the effective hydrodynamic radius and the kernel width:\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{eff}} = w\n$$\n\nNow, we can analyze the change in the required drag force. The drag force is the force $\\boldsymbol{F}$ required to maintain a fixed marker speed $U = |\\boldsymbol{U}|$. From the marker's mobility equation, we can express the magnitude of the drag force, $F = |\\boldsymbol{F}|$, as:\n$$\nF = (M_{\\text{marker}}(w))^{-1} U = 6\\pi\\mu w U\n$$\nThis shows that for a fixed speed $U$ and viscosity $\\mu$, the drag force is directly proportional to the kernel width $w$.\n\nWe are asked to find the multiplicative change in drag, $\\Lambda$, when the kernel width changes from a reference value $w_1 = h$ to a new value $w_2 = \\alpha h$.\nLet $F_1$ be the drag force corresponding to $w_1 = h$:\n$$\nF_1 = 6\\pi\\mu w_1 U = 6\\pi\\mu h U\n$$\nLet $F_2$ be the drag force corresponding to $w_2 = \\alpha h$:\n$$\nF_2 = 6\\pi\\mu w_2 U = 6\\pi\\mu (\\alpha h) U\n$$\n\nThe multiplicative change in drag, $\\Lambda$, is defined as the ratio of the new drag to the original drag:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{F_2}{F_1}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_1$ and $F_2$:\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\frac{6\\pi\\mu (\\alpha h) U}{6\\pi\\mu h U}\n$$\nAll terms cancel out except for the scaling factor $\\alpha$.\n$$\n\\Lambda = \\alpha\n$$\nThus, the multiplicative change in drag is equal to the scaling factor applied to the kernel width.",
