It is based on fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and statistical mechanics (Stokes-Einstein relation, Péclet number). All necessary information for derivation and calculation is provided, and the given numerical values are physically realistic for typical colloidal systems. The wording is precise, and the questions are unambiguous. There are no contradictions, missing data, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe Péclet number, denoted as $Pe$, is a dimensionless quantity that compares the rate of advection by a flow to the rate of diffusion. For a shear flow, it is defined as the ratio of the characteristic timescale of thermal diffusion, $\\tau_{diff}$, to the characteristic timescale of shear, $\\tau_{shear}$.\n$$Pe = \\frac{\\tau_{diff}}{\\tau_{shear}}$$\n\nThe characteristic timescale of the shear flow is the inverse of the shear rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}$.\n$$\\tau_{shear} = \\frac{1}{\\dot{\\gamma}}$$\n\nThe characteristic timescale for diffusion, $\\tau_{diff}$, is the time required for a particle to diffuse a distance on the order of its own size, in this case, its radius $a$. From the theory of Brownian motion, the mean squared displacement is related to time $t$ and the diffusion coefficient $D$ by $\\langle (\\Delta x)^2 \\rangle = 2Dt$. The time to diffuse a distance $a$ is thus:\n$$\\tau_{diff} \\sim \\frac{a^2}{D}$$\nHere, $D$ is the translational diffusion coefficient of an isolated spherical particle. The problem specifies to use the Stokes–Einstein relation, which provides an expression for $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{k_B T}{f}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $f$ is the frictional drag coefficient. For a spherical particle of radius $a$ in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta_0$, the Stokes drag coefficient is:\n$$f = 6 \\pi \\eta_0 a$$\nSubstituting this expression for $f$ into the equation for $D$ gives:\n$$D = \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta_0 a}$$\nNow we can write the diffusive timescale in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\\tau_{diff} = \\frac{a^2 (6 \\pi \\eta_0 a)}{k_B T} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\eta_0 a^3}{k_B T}$$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $\\tau_{diff}$ and $\\tau_{shear}$ into the definition of the Péclet number:\n$$Pe = \\frac{\\tau_{diff}}{\\tau_{shear}} = \\frac{\\frac{6 \\pi \\eta_0 a^3}{k_B T}}{\\frac{1}{\\dot{\\gamma}}} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\eta_0 a^3 \\dot{\\gamma}}{k_B T}$$\nThis is the required expression for the Péclet number.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values. We must first convert all values to the International System of Units (SI).\n- Particle radius: $a = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Temperature: $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Solvent viscosity: $\\eta_0 = 1\\,\\mathrm{mPa\\cdot s} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^{-1} \\cdot s^{-1}}$\n- Shear rate: $\\dot{\\gamma} = 10^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_B \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot K^{-1}} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2 \\cdot s^{-2} \\cdot K^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $Pe$:\n$$Pe = \\frac{6 \\pi (1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^{-1} \\cdot s^{-1}}) (0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3 (10^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2 \\cdot s^{-2} \\cdot K^{-1}}) (300\\,\\mathrm{K})}$$\n$$Pe = \\frac{6 \\pi (1 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.125 \\times 10^{-18}) (100)}{1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 300}$$\n$$Pe = \\frac{2.356194... \\times 10^{-19}}{4.141947 \\times 10^{-21}} \\approx 56.886$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the Péclet number is $56.9$.\n\nThe physical assumptions necessary for this estimate to be valid are implicit in the use of the Stokes-Einstein relation for an isolated sphere:\n1.  **Dilute Suspension:** The calculation assumes the particle is isolated, meaning it does not interact with other particles. This is strictly valid only in the limit of zero particle volume fraction ($\\phi \\to 0$). In dense suspensions, hydrodynamic and direct interparticle interactions become significant and modify the effective diffusion.\n2.  **Newtonian Solvent:** The fluid viscosity $\\eta_0$ is assumed to be constant, independent of the shear rate.\n3.  **No-Slip Boundary Condition:** The Stokes drag law used assumes a no-slip condition at the particle-fluid interface.\n4.  **Spherical Particles:** The geometric factor of $6\\pi$ in the drag coefficient is specific to spheres.\n5.  **Negligible Inertia:** The system is assumed to be in the low Reynolds number regime, where inertial forces on the particles are negligible compared to viscous forces. This is characteristic of microscale flows.\n\nFinally, we assess the implications of the calculated Péclet number. We found $Pe \\approx 56.9$, which satisfies the condition $Pe \\gg 1$. The Péclet number represents the ratio of the shear-advection rate to the thermal diffusion rate. Since $Pe \\gg 1$, the transport of particles is dominated by the imposed shear flow rather than by random thermal (Brownian) motion. Shear advection drives particles together much faster than diffusion can separate them. Consequently, thermal energy is insufficient to prevent particle collisions and allow them to escape from forming clusters. The system's rheological response is therefore governed by the interactions that arise when particles are forced into close proximity, namely short-range hydrodynamic lubrication forces and, in the context of DST, frictional contacts between particles. These mechanisms are \"athermal\" as they are not driven by thermal energy, and \"contact-dominated\" because they are activated by particle-particle contacts. This high-$Pe$ regime is the canonical condition under which discontinuous shear thickening and jamming are observed in dense suspensions.",

It presents a standard problem in the rheology of dense suspensions, based on established physical principles. The provided parameters are physically realistic for colloidal systems. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, I will proceed with a full derivation and solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive a leading-order estimate for the onset macroscopic shear stress, $\\sigma^{\\star}$, at which discontinuous shear thickening (DST) occurs in a dense suspension. The onset of DST is defined as the point where the applied stress is sufficient to overcome a short-range repulsive force, $F^{\\star}$, between particles, allowing the formation of a percolating network of frictional contacts.\n\nThe derivation will be based on two fundamental principles as requested:\n1.  The definition of macroscopic Cauchy stress ($\\sigma$) as force per unit area.\n2.  Static force balance on a near-contact particle pair in the overdamped (zero Reynolds number) limit.\n\nLet us begin by considering the forces acting on a representative particle of radius $a$ within the dense suspension under an applied simple shear flow. The macroscopic shear stress, $\\sigma$, is transmitted through the material. In a dense suspension, this stress is primarily supported by the particles. We can estimate the typical magnitude of the force exerted on a single particle by the surrounding stressed medium. The stress $\\sigma$ represents a force per unit area. The characteristic area associated with a single particle is its cross-sectional area, which scales as $a^2$. Therefore, the magnitude of the force, $F_{hydro}$, that the flow exerts to push one particle against another can be estimated as:\n$$\nF_{hydro} \\sim \\sigma a^2\n$$\nThis is the compressive force driving particles together along the compressive axis of the shear flow (oriented at approximately $45^{\\circ}$ to the flow and gradient directions).\n\nThe particles are stabilized by a short-range repulsive interaction, which can support a maximum compressive normal force of magnitude $F^{\\star}$ before the particles are pushed into frictional contact.\n\nAccording to the principle of static force balance at the particle scale, and given that the system is in the overdamped Stokes flow regime where inertial forces are negligible, the hydrodynamic forces must be balanced by the interparticle forces. The critical condition for the onset of DST is reached when the hydrodynamic compressive force is just large enough to overcome the maximum repulsive force. At this point, widespread frictional contacts can begin to form.\n\nWe establish the force balance at this critical threshold:\n$$\nF_{hydro} \\approx F^{\\star}\n$$\n\nSubstituting our previous scaling for the hydrodynamic force in terms of the macroscopic stress $\\sigma$, which we now label as the critical onset stress $\\sigma^{\\star}$, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\star} a^2 \\approx F^{\\star}\n$$\n\nSolving for the onset shear stress $\\sigma^{\\star}$, we obtain the leading-order estimate:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{F^{\\star}}{a^2}\n$$\n\nThis expression provides the scaling relationship between the macroscopic stress and the microscopic particle properties. It justifies the area scale, $a^2$, as the effective area per particle over which the macroscopic stress acts to generate the microscopic contact force.\n\nThe primary assumption made in this derivation is that the constant of proportionality relating $\\sigma a^2$ to the actual compressive force is of order unity. This is a standard and reasonable assumption for a leading-order estimate in a dense system (e.g., volume fraction $\\phi > 0.5$). More detailed theories would introduce a prefactor dependent on volume fraction and particle arrangement, but the fundamental scaling $\\sigma^{\\star} \\propto F^{\\star}/a^2$ is robust.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given numerical values.\nThe given parameters are:\n- Particle radius: $a = 0.75\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.75 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Maximum repulsive force: $F^{\\star} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n\nWe substitute these values into our derived expression for $\\sigma^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{N}}{(0.75 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n$$\na^2 = (0.75 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 0.5625 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\nNow, compute the value of $\\sigma^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{N}}{0.5625 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = \\frac{1.8}{0.5625} \\times 10^{-11 - (-12)}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\star} \\approx 3.2 \\times 10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 32\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\sigma^{\\star} \\approx 32.0\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThis value represents the macroscopic shear stress required to initiate frictional contacts and trigger discontinuous shear thickening in this model suspension.",

The relevant shear stress $\\tau$ is the $xy$-component of the macroscopic stress tensor, $\\tau = \\sigma_{xy}$.\n\nThe computational algorithm proceeds through the following steps for each test case:\n\n1.  **Compute Suspension Volume**: The suspension volume $V$ is calculated for a cylindrical geometry defined by the rheometer plate radius $R$ and gap height $h$:\n    $$\n    V = \\pi R^2 h\n    $$\n\n2.  **Compute the Total Stress Dyadic**: The un-normalized stress, which we can call the total stress dyadic $\\boldsymbol{S}$, is computed by summing the contributions from all pairwise and single-particle interactions:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{S} = \\sum_{ij}\\mathbf{r}_{ij}\\otimes\\mathbf{F}_{ij}\\;+\\;\\sum_{i}\\mathbf{r}_{i}\\otimes\\mathbf{f}_{i}\n    $$\n    Each term in the sum is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix resulting from the outer product of a position vector and a force vector. For instance, for $\\mathbf{a}=(a_x, a_y, a_z)$ and $\\mathbf{b}=(b_x, b_y, b_z)$, the outer product is:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{a} \\otimes \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_x b_x  a_x b_y  a_x b_z \\\\ a_y b_x  a_y b_y  a_y b_z \\\\ a_z b_x  a_z b_y  a_z b_z \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The implementation involves initializing a $3 \\times 3$ zero matrix and accumulating the results of these outer products.\n\n3.  **Compute the Macroscopic Stress Tensor**: The macroscopic Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is obtained by volumetric averaging, i.e., dividing the total stress dyadic $\\boldsymbol{S}$ by the suspension volume $V$:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{V}\\boldsymbol{S}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Extract Shear Stress**: The macroscopic shear stress $\\tau$ is extracted from the computed tensor. It is the component $\\sigma_{xy}$, which corresponds to the element at row $0$, column $1$ of the matrix representation of $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ (using $0$-based indexing for axes $x, y, z$).\n\n5.  **Compute Predicted Torque**: The predicted torque, $T_{\\text{pred}}$, is calculated using the extracted shear stress $\\tau$ and the given plate radius $R$:\n    $$\n    T_{\\text{pred}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}R^3\\tau\n    $$\n\n6.  **Perform Validation**: The predicted torque $T_{\\text{pred}}$ is compared against the measured torque $T_{\\text{meas}}$ using the specified criteria:\n    - If $|T_{\\text{meas}}| \\geq 10^{-6}$, the validation is true if the relative difference is within $5\\%$: $|\\frac{T_{\\text{pred}} - T_{\\text{meas}}}{T_{\\text{meas}}}| \\leq 0.05$.\n    - If $|T_{\\text{meas}}|  10^{-6}$, the validation is true if the absolute difference is less than $10^{-6}$: $|T_{\\text{pred}} - T_{\\text{meas}}|  10^{-6}$.\n\nThis procedure is systematically applied to each of the provided test cases to generate the required output.",
