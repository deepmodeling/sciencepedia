            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded and well-posed, asking for a derivation based on fundamental principles of tensor algebra and kinematics.\n\nWe begin by establishing the relationship between the left Cauchy-Green (Finger) tensor $\\boldsymbol{B}(t,t')$ and the principal stretch ratios $\\lambda_{i}(t,t')$. For notational conciseness within the derivation, we will denote the deformation-dependent quantities $\\boldsymbol{F}(t,t')$, $\\boldsymbol{B}(t,t')$, and $\\lambda_{i}(t,t')$ as $\\boldsymbol{F}$, $\\boldsymbol{B}$, and $\\lambda_{i}$ respectively.\n\nThe problem states that the Finger tensor is defined as the left Cauchy-Green tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B} = \\boldsymbol{F}\\boldsymbol{F}^{\\top}\n$$\nThe problem also assumes the existence of the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient $\\boldsymbol{F}$. We use the left polar decomposition:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{R}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{V}$ is the left stretch tensor, which is symmetric ($\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\top} = \\boldsymbol{V}$) and positive-definite, and $\\boldsymbol{R}$ is a proper orthogonal tensor representing a pure rotation ($\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{R} = \\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\top} = \\boldsymbol{I}$, where $\\boldsymbol{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor).\n\nSubstituting the left polar decomposition into the definition of $\\boldsymbol{B}$ yields:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B} = (\\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{R})(\\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{R})^{\\top} = \\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\top}\n$$\nUsing the properties $\\boldsymbol{V}^{\\top} = \\boldsymbol{V}$ and $\\boldsymbol{R}\\boldsymbol{R}^{\\top} = \\boldsymbol{I}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{B} = \\boldsymbol{V}\\boldsymbol{I}\\boldsymbol{V} = \\boldsymbol{V}^2\n$$\nThe problem states that the deformation has real, positive principal stretches $\\lambda_i$. The eigenvalues of the left stretch tensor $\\boldsymbol{V}$ are precisely these principal stretches. Since $\\boldsymbol{V}$ is symmetric, it is diagonalizable. There exists an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors $\\{\\boldsymbol{n}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{n}_{2}, \\boldsymbol{n}_{3}\\}$ such that the action of $\\boldsymbol{V}$ on each $\\boldsymbol{n}_{i}$ is a simple scaling by the corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$.
