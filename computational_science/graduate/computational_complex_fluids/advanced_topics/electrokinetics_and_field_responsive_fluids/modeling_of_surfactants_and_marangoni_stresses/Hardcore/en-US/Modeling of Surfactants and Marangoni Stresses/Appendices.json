            "solution": "The objective is to derive an expression for the surface excess, $\\Gamma(c)$, for a nonideal soluble surfactant. The derivation begins with the fundamental thermodynamic relations provided.\n\nThe Gibbs adsorption isotherm for a single solute at constant temperature $T$ and pressure is given as:\n$$d\\gamma = -\\Gamma \\, d\\mu$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the surface tension, $\\Gamma$ is the surface excess, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential of the surfactant.\n\nFrom this relation, the surface excess $\\Gamma$ can be expressed as the ratio of the change in surface tension to the change in chemical potential:\n$$\\Gamma = -\\frac{d\\gamma}{d\\mu}$$\n\nSince the surface tension $\\gamma$ is given as a function of the bulk concentration $c$, $\\gamma = \\gamma(c)$, and we seek an expression for $\\Gamma$ as a function of $c$, it is convenient to express the derivatives with respect to $c$. Using the chain rule, we can write:\n$$\\frac{d\\gamma}{dc} = \\frac{d\\gamma}{d\\mu} \\frac{d\\mu}{dc}$$\n\nSubstituting $\\frac{d\\gamma}{d\\mu} = -\\Gamma$ into this equation gives:\n$$\\frac{d\\gamma}{dc} = -\\Gamma \\frac{d\\mu}{dc}$$\n\nSolving for $\\Gamma$ yields:\n$$\\Gamma = -\\frac{1}{\\frac{d\\mu}{dc}} \\frac{d\\gamma}{dc}$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the derivative of the chemical potential with respect to concentration, $\\frac{d\\mu}{dc}$.

From this scaling analysis, identify the natural dimensionless groups that quantify (i) the competition between interfacial advection and surface diffusion, (ii) the ratio of Marangoni shear to viscous shear, and (iii) the ratio of viscous stresses to capillary forces responsible for shape deformation. Then, based on those groups, select all statements below that correctly define these groups and explain the physical regimes they demarcate for interfacial transport and flow.\n\nA. The surface Péclet number $Pe_s$ quantifies the ratio of interfacial advection to surface diffusion and is $Pe_s = U L/D_s$.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a rigorous analysis. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Nondimensionalization and Derivation of Dimensionless Groups\n\nWe introduce the following dimensionless variables, denoted by a prime ($'$):\n$x' = x/L$, $t' = t/(L/U)$, $\\boldsymbol{u}_s' = \\boldsymbol{u}_s/U$.\nThe surfactant concentration is expressed as a perturbation of characteristic magnitude $\\Gamma_0$ around a reference state. We nondimensionalize the perturbation itself: $\\Gamma = \\Gamma_{ref} + \\Gamma_0 \\Gamma'$, where $\\Gamma'$ is of order unity. The surface gradient and time derivative operators transform as $\\nabla_s = (1/L)\\nabla_s'$ and $\\partial/\\partial t = (U/L)\\partial/\\partial t'$.\n\n**(i) Surfactant Transport: Advection vs. Diffusion**\n\nThe surfactant transport equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_s\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{u}_s\\,\\Gamma) = D_s\\,\\nabla_s^2 \\Gamma\n$$\nSubstituting the scaled variables and considering only the perturbation $\\Gamma_0 \\Gamma'$ (as the uniform $\\Gamma_{ref}$ satisfies the equation trivially if $\\boldsymbol{u}_s$ has no divergence), we obtain:\n$$\n\\frac{U}{L}\\frac{\\partial (\\Gamma_0 \\Gamma')}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{1}{L}\\nabla_s'\\cdot(U\\boldsymbol{u}_s' \\Gamma_0 \\Gamma') \\approx D_s \\frac{1}{L^2}\\nabla_s'^2(\\Gamma_0 \\Gamma')\n$$\nAssuming $\\boldsymbol{u}_s'$ and $\\Gamma'$ are of order $O(1)$, we can analyze the scales of the terms:\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\frac{U\\Gamma_0}{L}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma'}{\\partial t'} + \\nabla_s'\\cdot(\\boldsymbol{u}_s'\\Gamma') \\right]}_{\\text{Advection term, scale } \\sim U\\Gamma_0/L} = \\underbrace{D_s \\frac{\\Gamma_0}{L^2}\\nabla_s'^2\\Gamma'}_{\\text{Diffusion term, scale } \\sim D_s\\Gamma_0/L^2}\n$$\nThe ratio of the magnitude of the advection term to the diffusion term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Advection}}{\\text{Diffusion}} \\sim \\frac{U\\Gamma_0/L}{D_s\\Gamma_0/L^2} = \\frac{UL}{D_s}\n$$\nThis defines the **surface Péclet number**, $Pe_s = UL/D_s$. It quantifies the competition between advective transport of surfactant by the interfacial flow and diffusive transport due to concentration gradients.\n\n**(ii) Tangential Stress: Marangoni vs. Viscous Shear**\n\nThe tangential stress balance is:\n$$\n\\tau_{visc} = \\boldsymbol{t}\\cdot\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{n}\\right) = \\nabla_s \\gamma(\\Gamma) = \\tau_{Marangoni}\n$$\nThe viscous shear stress exerted by the bulk fluid on the interface scales as $\\tau_{visc} \\sim \\eta (\\partial u_t / \\partial n)$, where $u_t$ is the tangential velocity and $n$ is the normal coordinate into the fluid. For a shear flow varying over a lateral scale $L$, the velocity variation penetrates into the fluid over a similar length scale $L$. Thus, the viscous stress scales as:\n$$\n\\tau_{visc} \\sim \\eta \\frac{U}{L}\n$$\nThe Marangoni stress arises from gradients in surface tension. Using the given equation of state, $\\gamma(\\Gamma) = \\gamma_0 - E\\,\\Gamma$, the stress is $\\nabla_s \\gamma = -E \\nabla_s \\Gamma$. Its magnitude scales as:\n$$\n|\\tau_{Marangoni}| \\sim E \\frac{\\Delta\\Gamma}{L}\n$$\nUsing the characteristic concentration perturbation $\\Delta\\Gamma \\sim \\Gamma_0$, we have:\n$$\n|\\tau_{Marangoni}| \\sim \\frac{E\\Gamma_0}{L}\n$$\nThe ratio of Marangoni stress to viscous shear stress is:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\tau_{Marangoni}|}{\\tau_{visc}} \\sim \\frac{E\\Gamma_0/L}{\\eta U/L} = \\frac{E\\Gamma_0}{\\eta U}\n$$\nLet's define the characteristic surface tension variation as $\\Delta\\gamma = E\\Gamma_0$. The ratio becomes $\\Delta\\gamma/(\\eta U)$. This defines the **Marangoni number**, $Ma = \\Delta\\gamma/(\\eta U)$.\n\n**(iii) Normal Stress: Viscous vs. Capillary**\n\nThe normal stress balance determines the interface shape. Viscous stresses in the fluid tend to deform the interface, while capillary forces (surface tension) resist deformation.\nThe viscous normal stress, $\\sigma_{nn}$, scales similarly to the viscous shear stress, $\\sigma_{nn} \\sim \\eta (\\partial u/\\partial x) \\sim \\eta U/L$.\nThe capillary force per unit area (pressure) scales as $p_{cap} \\sim \\gamma \\kappa$. Using the characteristic surface tension scale $\\gamma_0$ and the given curvature scale $\\kappa \\sim 1/L$, we get:\n$$\np_{cap} \\sim \\frac{\\gamma_0}{L}\n$$\nThe ratio of viscous deforming stress to the capillary restoring pressure is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Viscous Stress}}{\\text{Capillary Pressure}} \\sim \\frac{\\eta U/L}{\\gamma_0/L} = \\frac{\\eta U}{\\gamma_0}\n$$\nThis defines the **Capillary number**, $Ca = \\eta U / \\gamma_0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The surface Péclet number $Pe_s$ quantifies the ratio of interfacial advection to surface diffusion and is $Pe_s = U L/D_s$. The regime $Pe_s \\ll 1$ implies diffusion-dominated transport with nearly uniform $\\Gamma$ and weak interfacial gradients, whereas $Pe_s \\gg 1$ implies advection-dominated transport with large interfacial gradients possible.**\n- **Analysis**: My derivation confirms that $Pe_s = UL/D_s$ is the dimensionless group comparing advection to diffusion. The physical interpretations of the limits are correct. When diffusion is fast compared to advection ($Pe_s \\ll 1$), concentration gradients are smoothed out, leading to a nearly uniform $\\Gamma$. When advection is fast ($Pe_s \\gg 1$), surfactant is transported by the flow, which can create and sustain sharp gradients against the slow smoothing effect of diffusion.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The Marangoni number $Ma = \\Delta \\gamma/(\\eta U)$ measures the ratio of Marangoni stress to viscous shear at the interface. The regime $Ma \\gg 1$ implies the interface behaves nearly immobile due to strong surface-tension gradients, suppressing interfacial slip, while $Ma \\ll 1$ implies negligible Marangoni influence on the shear.**\n- **Analysis**: My derivation confirms that $Ma = \\Delta\\gamma/(\\eta U)$ (with $\\Delta\\gamma = E\\Gamma_0$) is the ratio of Marangoni stress to viscous shear. The physical interpretation is correct. If $Ma \\gg 1$, surface tension gradients generate stresses that are much larger than the applied viscous shear, forcing the interfacial velocity to adjust to reduce these gradients, often leading to a near-zero velocity (a \"rigid\" or \"immobile\" interface). If $Ma \\ll 1$, the Marangoni stresses are a negligible perturbation to the viscous stress balance.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The Capillary number $Ca = \\eta U/\\gamma$ compares viscous stresses to capillary forces controlling surface shape. The regime $Ca \\ll 1$ yields small deformations and an almost flat interface, while $Ca \\gg 1$ allows significant shape deformation under flow.**\n- **Analysis**: My derivation confirms that $Ca = \\eta U/\\gamma_0$ is the ratio of viscous stress to capillary pressure. Using $\\gamma$ to denote the characteristic surface tension scale instead of $\\gamma_0$ is common and acceptable. The physical descriptions of the limits are correct. A small $Ca$ means capillary forces (which resist bending) dominate, keeping the interface flat. A large $Ca$ means viscous forces overwhelm capillarity, leading to large deformations.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For insoluble surfactant with $\\gamma = \\gamma_0 - E \\Gamma$, the relevant $\\Delta \\gamma$ in $Ma$ scales like $E\\,\\Delta \\Gamma$; therefore, even when $Pe_s \\ll 1$, $Ma \\gg 1$ must imply large interfacial deformations (wrinkling) due to elastic stiffening, regardless of $Ca$.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement incorrectly conflates two distinct physical effects. Interfacial deformation (\"wrinkling\") is governed by the normal stress balance, an effect quantified by the Capillary number, $Ca$. The Marangoni number, $Ma$, governs the tangential stress balance and in-plane flow. One can have a large $Ma$ and a very small $Ca$, which would result in a flow strongly modified by Marangoni stress on a nearly flat interface. Deformation is not a necessary consequence of a large $Ma$. The claim that it occurs \"regardless of $Ca$\" is fundamentally incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. When $Pe_s \\gg 1$ and $Ma \\gg 1$, an initially clean interface cannot sustain any flow and will always instantly jam, independent of $Ca$ and the precise equation of state $\\gamma(\\Gamma)$.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement contains a critical logical flaw. A \"clean interface\" implies $\\Gamma = 0$ everywhere. If $\\Gamma=0$, then $\\nabla_s \\Gamma = 0$ and consequently the Marangoni stress $\\nabla_s \\gamma = -E\\nabla_s \\Gamma$ is identically zero. No Marangoni effect can occur, and the interface cannot \"jam\" due to surface tension gradients. The flow would proceed as if on a clean interface, unimpeded by Marangoni effects. The premise of a \"clean interface\" contradicts the mechanism of \"jamming\" that relies on the presence and advection of surfactant.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. The correct definition of the Capillary number in surfactant-laden flow is $Ca = \\gamma/(\\eta U)$, and $Ca \\gg 1$ implies capillarity dominates viscous stresses, maintaining an almost flat interface.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement is incorrect in two ways. First, the definition provided, $\\gamma/(\\eta U)$, is the inverse of the standard Capillary number, $Ca = \\eta U / \\gamma$. Second, the physical interpretation is inverted. The regime $Ca \\gg 1$ corresponds to viscous forces dominating capillarity, leading to large deformations, not a flat interface. The condition for a flat interface where capillarity dominates is $Ca \\ll 1$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**G. In the limit $Pe_s \\ll 1$, interfacial diffusion rapidly homogenizes $\\Gamma$, so the dimensional Marangoni stress magnitude $\\|\\nabla_s \\gamma\\|$ becomes small even if a nominal $Ma$ defined using a fixed $\\Delta \\gamma$ scale is large; diffusion suppresses realized $\\Delta \\gamma$ by reducing $\\nabla_s \\Gamma$.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement presents a correct and important physical insight. When $Pe_s \\ll 1$, diffusion is very efficient at smoothing out any concentration gradients created by the flow. While a nominal Marangoni number, $Ma_{nom} = E\\Gamma_0/(\\eta U)$, might be large based on a reference concentration scale $\\Gamma_0$, the *actual* concentration variation $\\Delta\\Gamma$ that can be sustained at steady state is very small (it can be shown to scale with $Pe_s$). Since the Marangoni stress $|\\nabla_s \\gamma| = E|\\nabla_s\\Gamma|$ is proportional to the concentration gradient, the realized stress becomes small. Thus, rapid diffusion effectively weakens the Marangoni effect.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**",

            "solution": "The user requests a solution for the transport of an insoluble surfactant on a rotating, circular interface. The problem is a classic advection-diffusion problem on a curved one-dimensional manifold. I will first validate the problem statement and then provide a detailed derivation of the analytical solution, followed by the implementation.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **System**: An insoluble surfactant with surface concentration $\\Gamma(\\theta, t)$ on a circular interface of radius $R$.\n- **Coordinates**: The interface is parameterized by the polar angle $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ and time $t \\ge 0$.\n- **Transport Mechanisms**:\n    - **Advection**: The interface rotates at a constant angular velocity $\\Omega$.\n    - **Diffusion**: The surfactant diffuses with a positive surface diffusivity $D_s  0$.\n- **Assumptions**:\n    1.

It is well-posed, with a linear PDE, a periodic domain, and a specified initial condition, ensuring a unique and stable solution. The language is objective and precise. The physical parameters are plausible, and the setup is self-contained and free of contradictions. The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in transport phenomena and is directly relevant to the specified topic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be developed.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Equation and Solution\n\nThe transport of an insoluble surfactant on an interface is governed by a conservation law. For a scalar concentration field $\\Gamma$ on a surface with a velocity field $\\mathbf{v}_s$, the general advection-diffusion equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_s \\cdot (\\Gamma \\mathbf{v}_s - D_s \\nabla_s \\Gamma) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_s$ is the surface gradient operator and $\\nabla_s \\cdot$ is the surface divergence. The problem states there are no sources or sinks. Assuming a constant surface diffusivity $D_s$, the equation expands to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_s \\cdot (\\Gamma \\mathbf{v}_s) = D_s \\nabla_s^2 \\Gamma\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_s^2 = \\nabla_s \\cdot \\nabla_s$ is the surface Laplacian (or Laplace-Beltrami operator).\n\nThe problem specifies an incompressible tangential velocity field, which means $\\nabla_s \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_s = 0$. The advection term simplifies:\n$$\n\\nabla_s \\cdot (\\Gamma \\mathbf{v}_s) = \\mathbf{v}_s \\cdot (\\nabla_s \\Gamma) + \\Gamma (\\nabla_s \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_s) = \\mathbf{v}_s \\cdot (\\nabla_s \\Gamma)\n$$\nThe governing equation thus becomes the standard advection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}_s \\cdot \\nabla_s \\Gamma = D_s \\nabla_s^2 \\Gamma\n$$\nWe now express the operators in the polar coordinate system of the circular interface. The position on the interface is described by the angle $\\theta$. The tangential velocity due to rotation at angular velocity $\\Omega$ is purely in the azimuthal direction, with magnitude $\\Omega R$. The velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v}_s = (\\Omega R) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta$.\nThe surface gradient and Laplacian on a circle of radius $R$ are:\n$$\n\\nabla_s = \\frac{1}{R} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\nabla_s^2 = \\frac{1}{R^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2}\n$$\nThe advection term becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_s \\cdot \\nabla_s \\Gamma = (\\Omega R \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial \\theta} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta\\right) = \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial \\theta}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the governing equation yields the one-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) for $\\Gamma(\\theta, t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial t} + \\Omega \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial \\theta} = \\frac{D_s}{R^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Gamma}{\\partial \\theta^2}\n$$\nThis is a linear PDE with constant coefficients. Given the periodic domain and the Fourier series initial condition, we seek a solution of the form:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\theta, t) = A_0(t) + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ A_k(t) \\cos(k\\theta) + B_k(t) \\sin(k\\theta) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting this series into the PDE and equating coefficients of the orthogonal basis functions $\\{\\cos(k\\theta), \\sin(k\\theta)\\}$ for each mode $k$, we obtain a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the time-dependent coefficients $A_k(t)$ and $B_k(t)$.\n\nFor the mean concentration ($k=0$):\n$$ \\frac{dA_0}{dt} = 0 \\implies A_0(t) = A_0(0) = a_0 $$\nThis confirms that the total amount of surfactant is conserved.\n\nFor any mode $k \\ge 1$:\nEquating coefficients of $\\cos(k\\theta)$: $\\frac{dA_k}{dt} + \\Omega (k B_k) = \\frac{D_s}{R^2} (-k^2 A_k)$\nEquating coefficients of $\\sin(k\\theta)$: $\\frac{dB_k}{dt} - \\Omega (k A_k) = \\frac{D_s}{R^2} (-k^2 B_k)$\n\nThis can be written as a matrix ODE system for each $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\begin{pmatrix} A_k \\\\ B_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -D_s k^2/R^2  -k\\Omega \\\\ k\\Omega  -D_s k^2/R^2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A_k \\\\ B_k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe solution to this system with initial conditions $A_k(0) = a_k$ and $B_k(0) = b_k$ is:\n$$\nA_k(t) = e^{-\\frac{D_s k^2 t}{R^2}} \\left( a_k \\cos(k\\Omega t) - b_k \\sin(k\\Omega t) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nB_k(t) = e^{-\\frac{D_s k^2 t}{R^2}} \\left( a_k \\sin(k\\Omega t) + b_k \\cos(k\\Omega t) \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the Fourier series expansion for $\\Gamma(\\theta,t)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\theta,t) = a_0 + \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} e^{-\\frac{D_s k^2 t}{R^2}} \\left[ \\Big(a_k \\cos(k\\Omega t) - b_k \\sin(k\\Omega t)\\Big)\\cos(k\\theta) + \\Big(a_k \\sin(k\\Omega t) + b_k \\cos(k\\Omega t)\\Big)\\sin(k\\theta) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric angle-subtraction identities, $\\cos(x)\\cos(y) + \\sin(x)\\sin(y) = \\cos(x-y)$ and $\\sin(x)\\cos(y) - \\cos(x)\\sin(y) = \\sin(x-y)$, the term in the sum simplifies significantly. Let $x=k\\theta$ and $y=k\\Omega t$. The expression in the square brackets becomes:\n$$\na_k \\Big(\\cos(k\\theta)\\cos(k\\Omega t) + \\sin(k\\theta)\\sin(k\\Omega t)\\Big) + b_k \\Big(\\sin(k\\theta)\\cos(k\\Omega t) - \\cos(k\\theta)\\sin(k\\Omega t)\\Big)\n$$\n$$\n= a_k \\cos(k(\\theta - \\Omega t)) + b_k \\sin(k(\\theta - \\Omega t))\n$$\nThis gives the final, elegant solution for the surfactant concentration:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\theta, t) = a_0 + \\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{K}} e^{-\\frac{D_s k^2 t}{R^2}} \\left[ a_k \\cos(k(\\theta - \\Omega t)) + b_k \\sin(k(\\theta - \\Omega t)) \\right]\n$$\nThis solution has a clear physical interpretation. The term $e^{-\\frac{D_s k^2 t}{R^2}}$ represents the exponential decay of the amplitude of each mode $k$ due to diffusion. Higher frequency modes (larger $k$) decay more rapidly. The argument of the trigonometric functions, $k(\\theta - \\Omega t)$, shows that the initial spatial pattern rotates with the imposed angular velocity $\\Omega$ in a Galilean transformation to a rotating frame. Advection rotates the pattern, and diffusion smooths it out.\n\nTo solve the problem, we will implement this final analytical formula for each test case, evaluating it at the specified point $(\\theta^\\ast,t^\\ast)$.",
