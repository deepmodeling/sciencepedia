            "problem": "Consider an incompressible, isothermal complex fluid modeled in three spatial dimensions. You are tasked with verifying material frame-indifference (objectivity) of a differential constitutive equation that will be implemented in a numerical solver for computational complex fluids. Work directly from first principles: kinematics of a continuum under a superposed rigid body motion, and the transformation of physical tensor fields between observers. Do not assume any prepackaged “objective rate” formulas. \n\nStart by considering a general superposed rigid body motion that maps an initial observer to a new observer via a time-dependent proper orthogonal tensor $Q(t)$ and a translation $c(t)$, with position mapping $x^{\\ast}(t)=Q(t)\\,x(t)+c(t)$. Let $v(x,t)$ be the velocity field and let $L(x,t)$ denote the velocity gradient, defined by $L=\\nabla v$, with symmetric and skew-symmetric parts $D=(L+L^{T})/2$ and $W=(L-L^{T})/2$. Let $\\tau(x,t)$ denote the extra stress tensor. Assume that under a pure change of observer (a superposed rigid body motion), material frame-indifference requires tensor fields representing intrinsic material response to transform by proper orthogonal similarity, and that $Q(t)$ satisfies $Q^{T}(t)Q(t)=I$.\n\n1) Derive, from the mapping $x^{\\ast}(t)=Q(t)\\,x(t)+c(t)$ and the definition $L=\\nabla v$, the transformation of the velocity gradient $L$, and hence the transformations of $D$ and $W$, between the two observers. Express your result in terms of $Q(t)$ and its time derivative $\\dot{Q}(t)$. In particular, identify any additional term generated by the time dependence of $Q(t)$.\n\n2) Using the same principles and the chain rule, derive the transformation of the time derivative of a transported second-order tensor field $\\tau(x,t)$ that transforms between observers by $\\tau^{\\ast}=Q\\,\\tau\\,Q^{T}$. Express $\\dot{\\tau}^{\\ast}$ in terms of $Q$, $\\dot{Q}$, $\\tau$, and $\\dot{\\tau}$.\n\nNow consider the following proposed differential constitutive equation for the extra stress $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau+\\lambda\\Big(\\dot{\\tau}-c\\,(W\\,\\tau-\\tau\\,W)-d\\,(D\\,\\tau+\\tau\\,D)\\Big)=2\\,\\eta\\,D+\\kappa\\,W,\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda>0$, $\\eta>0$, $d$ are fixed material parameters, and $c$ and $\\kappa$ are real coefficients introduced by the modeler. The equation is to be interpreted pointwise in space and time, with all fields smooth.\n\n3) Apply your derived transformation rules to test this constitutive equation for material frame-indifference under an arbitrary superposed rigid body motion. Identify which terms are nonobjective and state the necessary conditions on the coefficients to remove nonobjective contributions.\n\n4) Determine the unique value of the coefficient $c$ that renders the entire left-hand side of the constitutive equation objective under an arbitrary superposed rigid body motion, regardless of the value of $d$. Provide this value as your final answer. No rounding is required. The final answer must be a single real number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a step-by-step validation of a proposed constitutive equation against the principle of material frame-indifference, also known as the principle of objectivity. This principle states that the constitutive equations must be independent of the observer. An observer is characterized by a reference frame. A change of observer is represented by a superposed rigid-body motion.\n\nLet an inertial frame be the \"unstarred\" frame. A second frame, the \"starred\" frame, moves arbitrarily with respect to the first. The position of a material point $X$ at time $t$ is denoted by $x$ in the unstarred frame and $x^{\\ast}$ in the starred frame. The relationship is given by:\n$$x^{\\ast}(t) = Q(t) x(t) + c(t)$$\nwhere $c(t)$ is a time-dependent translation vector and $Q(t)$ is a time-dependent proper orthogonal tensor, satisfying $Q(t) Q(t)^T = Q(t)^T Q(t) = I$ and $\\det(Q)=1$, where $I$ is the identity tensor.\n\nA second-order tensor field $A$ is said to be objective (or frame-indifferent) if its components in the two frames are related by the similarity transformation $A^{\\ast} = Q A Q^T$. A vector field $u$ is objective if $u^{\\ast} = Q u$.\n\nWe will now proceed with the four parts of the problem.\n\n**1) Transformation of the velocity gradient $L$, rate of deformation $D$, and spin $W$.**\n\nThe velocity of a material point is the time derivative of its position. In the unstarred and starred frames, we have $v = \\dot{x}$ and $v^{\\ast} = \\dot{x}^{\\ast}$, respectively. Taking the time derivative of the position mapping, we get:\n$$v^{\\ast}(x^{\\ast}, t) = \\dot{x}^{\\ast} = \\frac{d}{dt} (Q(t) x(t) + c(t)) = \\dot{Q} x + Q \\dot{x} + \\dot{c}$$\nSubstituting $v = \\dot{x}$, we have $v^{\\ast} = \\dot{Q} x + Q v + \\dot{c}$. To compute the velocity gradient $L^{\\ast} = \\nabla^{\\ast} v^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial v^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}$, we need to express $v^{\\ast}$ as a function of $x^{\\ast}$. We use the inverse position mapping $x = Q^T (x^{\\ast}-c)$:\n$$v^{\\ast}(x^{\\ast}, t) = \\dot{Q} Q^T(x^{\\ast}-c) + Q v(Q^T(x^{\\ast}-c), t) + \\dot{c}$$\nNow, we take the gradient with respect to $x^{\\ast}$. Using the chain rule $\\frac{\\partial f(x)}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}$ and noting that $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} = Q^T$:\n$$L^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\partial v^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} \\left( \\dot{Q} Q^T(x^{\\ast}-c) \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} \\left( Q v(x,t) \\right) + \\frac{\\partial \\dot{c}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}$$\nThe derivatives of the terms are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} \\left( \\dot{Q} Q^T(x^{\\ast}-c) \\right) = \\dot{Q} Q^T$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} \\left( Q v(x,t) \\right) = Q \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} = Q (\\nabla v) Q^T = Q L Q^T$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\dot{c}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} = 0$$\nCombining these results gives the transformation rule for the velocity gradient $L$:\n$$L^{\\ast} = Q L Q^T + \\dot{Q} Q^T$$\nThe term $\\dot{Q} Q^T$ is an additional term arising from the time-dependence of the rotation tensor $Q$. Let's analyze this term. Differentiating $Q Q^T = I$ with respect to time gives $\\dot{Q} Q^T + Q \\dot{Q}^T = 0$. This implies $\\dot{Q} Q^T = -Q \\dot{Q}^T = -(\\dot{Q} Q^T)^T$. Let $\\Omega = \\dot{Q} Q^T$. The condition $\\Omega = -\\Omega^T$ shows that $\\Omega$ is a skew-symmetric tensor representing the angular velocity of the starred frame relative to the unstarred frame. Thus, $L^{\\ast} = Q L Q^T + \\Omega$.\n\nNow we find the transformations for the rate of deformation tensor $D = \\frac{1}{2}(L+L^T)$ and the spin tensor $W = \\frac{1}{2}(L-L^T)$.\nFor $D^{\\ast}$:\n$$D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}(L^{\\ast} + L^{\\ast T}) = \\frac{1}{2}((Q L Q^T + \\Omega) + (Q L Q^T + \\Omega)^T)$$\n$$D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}(Q L Q^T + \\Omega + Q L^T Q^T + \\Omega^T)$$\nSince $\\Omega$ is skew-symmetric, $\\Omega^T = -\\Omega$.\n$$D^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}(Q L Q^T + \\Omega + Q L^T Q^T - \\Omega) = \\frac{1}{2}Q(L+L^T)Q^T = Q D Q^T$$\nThe tensor $D$ is objective.\n\nFor $W^{\\ast}$:\n$$W^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}(L^{\\ast} - L^{\\ast T}) = \\frac{1}{2}((Q L Q^T + \\Omega) - (Q L Q^T + \\Omega)^T)$$\n$$W^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}(Q L Q^T + \\Omega - (Q L^T Q^T - \\Omega)) = \\frac{1}{2}(Q(L-L^T)Q^T + 2\\Omega)$$\n$$W^{\\ast} = Q W Q^T + \\Omega$$\nThe spin tensor $W$ is not objective; it transforms with an additional term $\\Omega = \\dot{Q}Q^T$, which is the spin of the observer's frame.\n\n**2) Transformation of the time derivative of $\\tau$.**\n\nWe are given that the stress tensor $\\tau$ transforms as an objective tensor: $\\tau^{\\ast} = Q \\tau Q^T$. The problem asks for the transformation of its time derivative. In the context of constitutive equations, $\\dot{\\tau}$ refers to the material time derivative, $\\frac{D\\tau}{Dt}$, which follows a material particle. We differentiate $\\tau^{\\ast}$ with respect to time using the product rule:\n$$\\dot{\\tau}^{\\ast} = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\tau^{\\ast}) = \\frac{d}{dt}(Q \\tau Q^T) = \\dot{Q} \\tau Q^T + Q \\dot{\\tau} Q^T + Q \\tau \\dot{Q}^T$$\nThis is the transformation rule for $\\dot{\\tau}$. The presence of $\\dot{Q}$ and $\\dot{Q}^T$ terms indicates that the material time derivative $\\dot{\\tau}$ is not an objective tensor.\n\n**3) Testing the constitutive equation for objectivity.**\n\nThe proposed constitutive equation is:\n$$\\tau+\\lambda\\Big(\\dot{\\tau}-c\\,(W\\,\\tau-\\tau\\,W)-d\\,(D\\,\\tau+\\tau\\,D)\\Big)=2\\,\\eta\\,D+\\kappa\\,W$$\nFor this equation to be objective, it must have the same form in the starred frame. That is:\n$$\\tau^{\\ast}+\\lambda\\Big(\\dot{\\tau}^{\\ast}-c\\,(W^{\\ast}\\,\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\,W^{\\ast})-d\\,(D^{\\ast}\\,\\tau^{\\ast}+\\tau^{\\ast}\\,D^{\\ast})\\Big)=2\\,\\eta\\,D^{\\ast}+\\kappa\\,W^{\\ast}$$\nLet's analyze the transformation of each term. We denote the expression inside the parenthesis on the left-hand side as $\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}$, an objective time rate to be determined.\n$$\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau} = \\dot{\\tau}-c\\,(W\\,\\tau-\\tau\\,W)-d\\,(D\\,\\tau+\\tau\\,D)$$\nIts counterpart in the starred frame is:\n$$\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}{}^{\\ast} = \\dot{\\tau}^{\\ast}-c\\,(W^{\\ast}\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}W^{\\ast})-d\\,(D^{\\ast}\\tau^{\\ast}+\\tau^{\\ast}D^{\\ast})$$\nLet's substitute the transformation rules:\n$D^{\\ast}\\tau^{\\ast}+\\tau^{\\ast}D^{\\ast} = (QDQ^T)(Q\\tau Q^T) + (Q\\tau Q^T)(QDQ^T) = Q(D\\tau+\\tau D)Q^T$. This term is objective.\n$W^{\\ast}\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}W^{\\ast} = (QWQ^T+\\Omega)(Q\\tau Q^T)-(Q\\tau Q^T)(QWQ^T+\\Omega) = Q(W\\tau-\\tau W)Q^T + \\Omega\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\Omega$.\n$\\dot{\\tau}^{\\ast} = \\dot{Q}\\tau Q^T+Q\\dot{\\tau}Q^T+Q\\tau\\dot{Q}^T = Q\\dot{\\tau}Q^T + (\\dot{Q}Q^T)(Q\\tau Q^T) - (Q\\tau Q^T)(Q\\dot{Q}^T) = Q\\dot{\\tau}Q^T + \\Omega\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\Omega$.\n\nNow substitute these into the expression for $\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}{}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}{}^{\\ast} = (Q\\dot{\\tau}Q^T + \\Omega\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\Omega) - c(Q(W\\tau-\\tau W)Q^T + \\Omega\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\Omega) - d(Q(D\\tau+\\tau D)Q^T)$$\nGroup terms that transform with $Q(\\cdot)Q^T$ and the remaining non-objective terms:\n$$\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}{}^{\\ast} = Q[\\dot{\\tau} - c(W\\tau-\\tau W) - d(D\\tau+\\tau D)]Q^T + (1-c)(\\Omega\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\Omega)$$\n$$\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}{}^{\\ast} = Q\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}Q^T + (1-c)(\\Omega\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\Omega)$$\nFor the entire left-hand side (LHS) of the constitutive equation to be objective, the term $\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}$ must be objective, i.e., $\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}{}^{\\ast}=Q\\overset{\\circ}{\\tau}Q^T$. This requires the non-objective part to vanish:\n$$(1-c)(\\Omega\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\Omega) = 0$$\nSince this must hold for any arbitrary rigid body motion (any skew-symmetric $\\Omega \\neq 0$) and any stress state ($\\tau^{\\ast}$), we must have $1-c=0$, which implies $c=1$.\nWith $c=1$, the LHS is objective.\n\nNow we analyze the right-hand side (RHS): $2\\,\\eta\\,D+\\kappa\\,W$.\nIn the starred frame, it becomes:\n$$\\text{RHS}^{\\ast} = 2\\,\\eta\\,D^{\\ast}+\\kappa\\,W^{\\ast} = 2\\,\\eta\\,(QDQ^T) + \\kappa\\,(QWQ^T+\\Omega)$$\n$$\\text{RHS}^{\\ast} = Q(2\\,\\eta\\,D+\\kappa\\,W)Q^T + \\kappa\\,\\Omega$$\nFor the RHS to be objective, the non-objective term $\\kappa\\,\\Omega$ must vanish. For an arbitrary rotation rate $\\Omega \\neq 0$, this requires $\\kappa=0$.\n\nIn summary, the term $-c\\lambda(W\\tau-\\tau W)$ contains a non-objective part, which combines with the non-objective part of $\\lambda\\dot{\\tau}$. The term $\\kappa W$ is also nonobjective. To remove all nonobjective contributions from the equation, the coefficients must satisfy $c=1$ and $\\kappa=0$.\n\n**4) Unique value for the coefficient $c$.**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $c$ that makes the entire left-hand side objective, regardless of the value of $d$. The LHS is $\\tau+\\lambda\\Big(\\dot{\\tau}-c\\,(W\\,\\tau-\\tau\\,W)-d\\,(D\\,\\tau+\\tau\\,D)\\Big)$.\nThe tensor $\\tau$ is objective by a given condition. The term containing $d$ involves $D\\tau+\\tau D$, and we showed that $D^{\\ast}\\tau^{\\ast}+\\tau^{\\ast}D^{\\ast} = Q(D\\tau+\\tau D)Q^T$, so this term is objective for any value of $d$.\nThe objectivity of the LHS thus depends on the rate term $\\dot{\\tau}-c(W\\tau-\\tau W)$. As derived in part 3), this combined term transforms as:\n$$Q(\\dot{\\tau}-c(W\\tau-\\tau W))Q^T + (1-c)(\\Omega\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\Omega)$$\nFor the LHS to be objective, all terms comprising it must be objective. This requires the non-objective remainder to be zero for any $\\Omega$ and $\\tau$.\n$$(1-c)(\\Omega\\tau^{\\ast}-\\tau^{\\ast}\\Omega) = 0$$\nGiven $\\lambda>0$ and the arbitrariness of $\\Omega$ and $\\tau$, the only way to satisfy this condition is to have:\n$$1-c=0$$\n$$c=1$$\nThis value of $c$ ensures that the combination $\\dot{\\tau} - (W\\tau-\\tau W)$, known as the Jaumann or corotational derivative, is an objective time rate. This condition is independent of the coefficient $d$. Thus, the unique value is $c=1$.",

The gradient operator with respect to $\\mathbf{x}'$, denoted $\\nabla'$, is related to the gradient operator with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$, denoted $\\nabla$, by the chain rule. The components of the gradient operators are related by $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x'_i} = \\sum_j \\frac{\\partial x_j}{\\partial x'_i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}$. From the position transformation, we have $\\frac{\\partial x_j}{\\partial x'_i} = Q_{ij}^{\\top} = Q_{ji}$. This implies the operator transformation $\\nabla' = Q \\nabla$.\n\nThe velocity gradient in the primed frame, $\\nabla' \\mathbf{v}'$, is the gradient of $\\mathbf{v}'$ with respect to $\\mathbf{x}'$. Using the given velocity transformation $\\mathbf{v}' = Q \\mathbf{v} + \\dot{Q} \\mathbf{x} + \\dot{\\mathbf{c}}$:\n$$\n\\nabla' \\mathbf{v}' = \\nabla'_{\\mathbf{x}'} \\left[ Q(t) \\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}(\\mathbf{x}',t), t) + \\dot{Q}(t) \\mathbf{x}(\\mathbf{x}',t) + \\dot{\\mathbf{c}}(t) \\right]\n$$\nWe evaluate the gradient of each term.\nFor the first term, using the chain rule for tensor-valued functions and the gradient operator transformation:\n$$\n\\nabla' (Q \\mathbf{v}) = Q (\\nabla \\mathbf{v}) Q^{\\top}\n$$\nFor the second term, substituting $\\mathbf{x} = Q^{\\top}(\\mathbf{x}' - \\mathbf{c})$:\n$$\n\\nabla' (\\dot{Q} \\mathbf{x}) = \\nabla' (\\dot{Q} Q^{\\top} (\\mathbf{x}' - \\mathbf{c}))\n$$\nSince $\\dot{Q} Q^{\\top}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$ depend only on time $t$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla' (\\dot{Q} \\mathbf{x}) = \\dot{Q} Q^{\\top}\n$$\nThe gradient of the third term, $\\dot{\\mathbf{c}}(t)$, is zero as it is spatially uniform.\nCombining these results, the transformation for the velocity gradient is:\n$$\n\\nabla' \\mathbf{v}' = Q (\\nabla \\mathbf{v}) Q^{\\top} + \\dot{Q} Q^{\\top}\n$$\nNow, we find the transformation for the rate-of-deformation tensor, $D' = \\frac{1}{2} ( \\nabla' \\mathbf{v}' + (\\nabla' \\mathbf{v}')^{\\top} )$.\n$$\nD' = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (Q (\\nabla \\mathbf{v}) Q^{\\top} + \\dot{Q} Q^{\\top}) + (Q (\\nabla \\mathbf{v}) Q^{\\top} + \\dot{Q} Q^{\\top})^{\\top} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the property $(AB)^{\\top} = B^{\\top}A^{\\top}$ and $(A+B)^{\\top} = A^{\\top}+B^{\\top}$:\n$$\nD' = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ Q (\\nabla \\mathbf{v}) Q^{\\top} + \\dot{Q} Q^{\\top} + (Q^{\\top})^{\\top} (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^{\\top} Q^{\\top} + (Q^{\\top})^{\\top} (\\dot{Q})^{\\top} \\right]\n$$\nSince $Q$ is orthogonal, $(Q^{\\top})^{\\top} = Q$.\n$$\nD' = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ Q (\\nabla \\mathbf{v}) Q^{\\top} + Q (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^{\\top} Q^{\\top} + \\dot{Q} Q^{\\top} + Q (\\dot{Q})^{\\top} \\right]\n$$\nFactoring out $Q$ and $Q^{\\top}$ from the first two terms:\n$$\nD' = Q \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\mathbf{v} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{v})^{\\top}) \\right] Q^{\\top} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\dot{Q} Q^{\\top} + Q (\\dot{Q})^{\\top} \\right]\n$$\nThe first term is $Q D Q^{\\top}$. For the second term, we use the property that differentiation of $Q Q^{\\top} = I$ gives $\\dot{Q} Q^{\\top} + Q (\\dot{Q})^{\\top} = 0$. This implies $Q (\\dot{Q})^{\\top} = - \\dot{Q} Q^{\\top}$, which shows that $\\dot{Q} Q^{\\top}$ is a skew-symmetric tensor. Let $W_{frame} = \\dot{Q} Q^{\\top}$. Then the second term is $\\frac{1}{2} [W_{frame} + W_{frame}^{\\top}]$. Since $W_{frame}$ is skew-symmetric, $W_{frame}^{\\top} = -W_{frame}$, and this term vanishes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} [W_{frame} - W_{frame}] = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the transformation law for the rate-of-deformation tensor is:\n$$\nD' = Q D Q^{\\top}\n$$\nThis shows that $D$ is an objective tensor. The superposed rigid-body motion of the observer, represented by the spin tensor $\\dot{Q} Q^{\\top}$, does not contribute to the rate-of-deformation tensor $D'$.\n\nNow, we demonstrate the objectivity of the Newtonian constitutive law, $T = -p I + 2 \\mu D$. A constitutive law is objective if its form is invariant under a change of observer and if the stress tensor transforms objectively, i.e., $T' = Q T Q^{\\top}$. We assume pressure $p$ and viscosity $\\mu$ are objective scalars, meaning $p' = p$ and $\\mu' = \\mu$.\nThe constitutive law in the primed frame $\\mathcal{S}'$ is $T' = -p' I + 2 \\mu' D'$. With our assumptions, this becomes $T' = -p I + 2 \\mu D'$.\nLet's see what the transformation $T' = Q T Q^{\\top}$ implies:\n$$\nQ T Q^{\\top} = Q (-p I + 2 \\mu D) Q^{\\top} = -p (Q I Q^{\\top}) + 2 \\mu (Q D Q^{\\top})\n$$\nUsing $Q I Q^{\\top} = Q Q^{\\top} = I$ and the derived transformation $D' = Q D Q^{\\top}$:\n$$\nQ T Q^{\\top} = -p I + 2 \\mu D'\n$$\nThis is precisely the expression for $T'$ from the constitutive law in the new frame. Thus, $T' = Q T Q^{\\top}$, confirming that the Cauchy stress tensor for a Newtonian fluid transforms objectively. The deviatoric stress for an incompressible fluid is $\\tau = T + pI = 2\\mu D$. The transformation is $\\tau' = Q \\tau Q^{\\top}$, since $T' + p'I = Q T Q^{\\top} + p I = Q(T+pI)Q^{\\top} = Q\\tau Q^{\\top}$. The relationship $\\tau' = 2\\mu D'$ holds because $D' = Q D Q^{\\top}$. The superposed motion of the observer does not add any extra terms to the deviatoric stress relation.\n\n### Part 2: Specialization to Rigid-Body Rotation\n\nWe now consider the specific case of rigid-body rotation in the inertial frame $\\mathcal{S}$, given by the velocity field $\\mathbf{v}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$ is a constant vector.\nWe compute the velocity gradient tensor, $(\\nabla \\mathbf{v})_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j}$.

The co-rotating frame rotates with the fluid at an angular velocity $\\omega$. The rotation from the laboratory basis to the co-rotating basis is given by the angle $\\theta(t) = \\omega t$.

This is physically incorrect. In a rigid-body rotation, there is no deformation, so an initial stress state should simply decay due to relaxation, not exhibit spurious oscillations. The initial shear stress in the co-rotating frame is $\\tau'_{xy}(0) = -\\tau_{0} \\exp(0) \\sin(0) = 0$. An objective constitutive model would predict that $\\tau'_{xy}(t)$ remains zero for all $t > 0$. The fact that this model predicts non-zero, oscillating shear stress is a direct consequence of using the nonobjective material time derivative $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\tau}}$. This result exemplifies a violation of the principle of material frame-indifference.\n\nThe closed-form analytic expression for $\\tau'_{xy}(t)$ is precisely the result derived in Task 2.",
