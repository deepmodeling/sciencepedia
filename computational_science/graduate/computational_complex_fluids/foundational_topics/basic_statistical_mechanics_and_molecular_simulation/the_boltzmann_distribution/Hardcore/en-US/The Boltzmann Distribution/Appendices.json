            "introduction": "While energy is a primary determinant of state population, it is not the only factor; the degeneracy of an energy level, or the number of distinct states sharing that energy, is equally crucial. This exercise explores this interplay by examining the rotational energy levels of a diatomic molecule . You will discover how the competition between the increasing degeneracy ($g_J = 2J+1$) and the decreasing Boltzmann factor leads to a maximum population at a non-zero rotational level, a key feature of molecular spectroscopy.",

            "problem": "A heteronuclear diatomic molecule can be modeled as a rigid rotor with rotational energy levels indexed by the integer quantum number $J \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$ and energies $E_J = B\\,h\\,c\\,J(J+1)$, where $B$ is the rotational constant expressed in inverse centimeters, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light. Each level has rotational degeneracy $g_J = 2J+1$. Consider the canonical ensemble at absolute temperature $T$ with Boltzmann constant ($k_{\\mathrm{B}}$).\n\nStarting only from the canonical probability assignment for discrete microstates and the presence of degeneracy, derive—using a controlled continuous approximation valid in the high-temperature regime where the most populated $J$ is large—the asymptotic expression for the rotational quantum number $J^{\\ast}(T)$ at which the level population is maximal.

No numerical evaluation or rounding is required. Because $J$ is dimensionless, no units are to be reported in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The population of a rotational energy level $J$, denoted $N_J$, in a canonical ensemble at temperature $T$ is proportional to the probability of occupying that level. According to the Boltzmann distribution, this probability is given by the product of the level's degeneracy, $g_J$, and the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-E_J / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T))$. The partition function serves as a normalization constant and does not affect the location of the maximum, so we can work with proportionality.\nThus, the population $N_J$ is proportional to:\n$$\nN_J \\propto g_J \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_J}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem provides the expressions for the energy levels and their degeneracies for a rigid rotor:\n$$\nE_J = B\\,h\\,c\\,J(J+1)\n$$\n$$\ng_J = 2J+1\n$$\nwhere $J \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$. Substituting these into the population expression yields:\n$$\nN_J \\propto (2J+1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B\\,h\\,c\\,J(J+1)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression represents the relative population of the discrete rotational levels. To find the quantum number $J^{\\ast}$ at which this population is maximized, we follow the directive to use a continuous approximation. This is valid in the high-temperature limit, where the thermal energy $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$ is large compared to the rotational energy spacing, causing many levels to be populated and the most populated level $J^{\\ast}$ to be large. We therefore treat $J$ as a continuous non-negative variable and find the maximum of the function $N(J)$.\n\nTo simplify the process of differentiation, it is advantageous to find the maximum of the natural logarithm of $N(J)$, as the logarithm is a strictly monotonic function and will have its maximum at the same value of $J$. Let $f(J) = \\ln(N(J))$.\n$$\nf(J) = \\ln\\left( (2J+1) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B\\,h\\,c\\,J(J+1)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) \\right) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality. Using the properties of logarithms:\n$$\nf(J) = \\ln(2J+1) - \\frac{B\\,h\\,c\\,J(J+1)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} + C\n$$\nExpanding the quadratic term in $J$:\n$$\nf(J) = \\ln(2J+1) - \\frac{B\\,h\\,c}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}(J^2 + J) + C\n$$\nTo find the value of $J$, denoted $J^{\\ast}$, that maximizes this function, we compute the first derivative with respect to $J$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{df(J)}{dJ} = \\frac{d}{dJ}\\left[ \\ln(2J+1) - \\frac{B\\,h\\,c}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}(J^2 + J) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{df(J)}{dJ} = \\frac{2}{2J+1} - \\frac{B\\,h\\,c}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}(2J+1)\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero for $J = J^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{2J^{\\ast}+1} - \\frac{B\\,h\\,c}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}(2J^{\\ast}+1) = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $J^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{2J^{\\ast}+1} = \\frac{B\\,h\\,c}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}(2J^{\\ast}+1)\n$$\n$$\n2 = \\frac{B\\,h\\,c}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}(2J^{\\ast}+1)^2\n$$\n$$\n(2J^{\\ast}+1)^2 = \\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{B\\,h\\,c}\n$$\nTaking the positive square root, since $J$ must be non-negative and therefore $2J^{\\ast}+1 > 0$:\n$$\n2J^{\\ast}+1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{B\\,h\\,c}}\n$$\nFinally, isolating $J^{\\ast}$ gives the desired expression:\n$$\n2J^{\\ast} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{B\\,h\\,c}} - 1\n$$\n$$\nJ^{\\ast}(T) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{B\\,h\\,c}} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$\nJ^{\\ast}(T) = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{2B\\,h\\,c}} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis is the asymptotic expression for the rotational quantum number corresponding to the most populated level in the high-temperature continuous approximation.\n\nThe problem additionally requires a comparison with a hypothetical non-degenerate spectrum. In such a case, the degeneracy factor $g_J$ would be a constant, which we can set to $1$ without loss of generality. The population function would then be:\n$$\nN_J' \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_J}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{B\\,h\\,c\\,J(J+1)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential is a negative and monotonically decreasing function for $J \\ge 0$. Consequently, $N_J'$ is a strictly decreasing function of $J$ for all $J \\ge 0$. The maximum population must therefore occur at the lowest possible quantum number, $J=0$. Thus, for a non-degenerate spectrum, the most populated level is always $J^{\\ast}_{nd} = 0$, independent of temperature.\n\nIn conclusion, the inclusion of the degeneracy factor $g_J = 2J+1$ is fundamentally responsible for the existence of a non-zero most populated level. The degeneracy increases with $J$, favoring higher levels, while the Boltzmann factor decreases exponentially, favoring lower levels. The competition between these two opposing factors creates a maximum at $J^{\\ast}(T) > 0$. The degeneracy factor thus changes the temperature dependence of the most populated level from a constant ($J=0$) to a function that grows with the square root of the temperature, $J^{\\ast}(T) \\propto \\sqrt{T}$, in the high-temperature limit.",
