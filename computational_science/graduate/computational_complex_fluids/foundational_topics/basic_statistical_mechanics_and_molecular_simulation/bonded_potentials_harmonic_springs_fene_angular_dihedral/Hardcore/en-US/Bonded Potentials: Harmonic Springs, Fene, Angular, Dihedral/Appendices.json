The bonded potential energy is given by $U(r) = \\frac{1}{2} k \\left(r - r_0\\right)^2$, where $r$ is the instantaneous separation between the two beads.

            "solution": "We begin by applying Newton's second law to the two beads. Let the positions of the beads with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ be $\\vec{r}_1(t)$ and $\\vec{r}_2(t)$, respectively. The bonded potential energy is given as $U(r) = \\frac{1}{2} k (r - r_0)^2$, where $r = |\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|$ is the separation distance. The force on bead $1$ from bead $2$ is $\\vec{F}_{12}$, and the force on bead $2$ from bead $1$ is $\\vec{F}_{21}$. These forces are derived from the potential energy:\n$\\vec{F}_{12} = -\\nabla_1 U(r)$. Since $r$ depends on $\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2$, we have $\\nabla_1 r = \\frac{\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2}{|\\vec{r}_1 - \\vec{r}_2|} = \\frac{\\vec{r}}{r}$.\nThe force magnitude is $F(r) = -\\frac{dU}{dr} = -k(r - r_0)$.\nThus, the force vector on bead $1$ is $\\vec{F}_{12} = F(r) \\frac{\\vec{r}}{r} = -k(r-r_0)\\frac{\\vec{r}}{r}$.

For the internal vibrational mode, we are interested in the dynamics of the separation distance $r$. Taking the dot product of the equation with $\\frac{\\vec{r}}{r}$ and considering only oscillations along the bond axis, the dynamics of the scalar separation $r$ can be described by:\n$$ \\mu \\ddot{r} = -k(r - r_0) $$\nLet $x(t) = r(t) - r_0$ be the displacement from the equilibrium bond length. Then $\\ddot{x} = \\ddot{r}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\mu \\ddot{x} = -kx $$\n$$ \\ddot{x} + \\frac{k}{\\mu} x = 0 $$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator.

Harmonic potential: $U_{\\mathrm{harm}}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\theta} (\\theta - \\theta_{0})^{2}$\n2.  Cosine potential: $U_{\\mathrm{cos}}(\\theta) = \\kappa \\left[ 1 - \\cos(\\theta - \\theta_{0}) \\right]$\n\nHere, $\\theta$ is the bond angle, $\\theta_{0}$ is the equilibrium or rest angle, $k_{\\theta}$ is the harmonic force constant, and $\\kappa$ is the stiffness parameter for the cosine potential.

For an analytic function $f(x)$, the expansion about $x=0$ is $f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \\frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \\frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3 + \\dots$.\nFor $f(x) = \\cos(x)$, the derivatives are $f'(x) = -\\sin(x)$, $f''(x) = -\\cos(x)$, $f'''(x) = \\sin(x)$, $f^{(4)}(x) = \\cos(x)$, etc.\nAt $x=0$, these evaluate to $f(0)=1$, $f'(0)=0$, $f''(0)=-1$, $f'''(0)=0$, $f^{(4)}(0)=1$.\nThe Taylor series for $\\cos(x)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\cos(x) = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\frac{x^6}{6!} + \\dots $$\nSubstituting $x = \\delta\\theta$ into the expression for $U_{\\mathrm{cos}}$, we obtain:\n$$ U_{\\mathrm{cos}}(\\delta\\theta) = \\kappa \\left[ 1 - \\left( 1 - \\frac{(\\delta\\theta)^2}{2!} + \\frac{(\\delta\\theta)^4}{4!} - \\dots \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ U_{\\mathrm{cos}}(\\delta\\theta) = \\kappa \\left[ \\frac{(\\delta\\theta)^2}{2} - \\frac{(\\delta\\theta)^4}{24} + O((\\delta\\theta)^6) \\right] $$\nThe expression $O((\\delta\\theta)^6)$ denotes terms of order $(\\delta\\theta)^6$ and higher, which are negligible for very small $\\delta\\theta$.\n\nThe leading-order term in this expansion for $U_{\\mathrm{cos}}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa(\\delta\\theta)^2$.

This is consistent with the general principle that any smooth potential energy minimum can be approximated by a harmonic potential for small displacements, where the effective spring constant is the curvature of the potential at the minimum.

The problem states $\\theta_0 \\in (0, \\pi)$, which ensures $\\sin(\\theta_0)  0$, so we are not approximating by zero. With this approximation, the $\\sin(\\theta_0)$ term is a constant and cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\langle x^2 \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\int_{-\\theta_0}^{\\pi - \\theta_0} x^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta k_{\\theta}}{2} x^2\\right) dx}{\\int_{-\\theta_0}^{\\pi - \\theta_0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta k_{\\theta}}{2} x^2\\right) dx} $$\nFurthermore, because the integrand is negligible far from $x=0$, extending the finite integration limits $[-\\theta_0, \\pi - \\theta_0]$ to $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ introduces only a very small error, which is higher order in the small parameter $k_B T / k_{\\theta}$. This is justified because both $\\theta_0$ and $\\pi-\\theta_0$ are much larger than the standard deviation of the angle, which scales as $\\sqrt{k_B T / k_\\theta}$.\n$$ \\langle x^2 \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta k_{\\theta}}{2} x^2\\right) dx}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta k_{\\theta}}{2} x^2\\right) dx} $$\nLet $\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta k_{\\theta}}{2}$. The integrals are standard Gaussian integrals. The denominator is:\n$$ I_0 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\alpha x^2) dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} $$\nThe numerator can be found by differentiating $I_0$ with respect to $\\alpha$:\n$$ I_2 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^2 \\exp(-\\alpha x^2) dx = -\\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\alpha x^2) dx = -\\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}}\\right) = -\\sqrt{\\pi} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^{-3/2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} $$\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\frac{I_2}{I_0} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\alpha} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha} $$\nSubstituting back $\\alpha = \\frac{\\beta k_{\\theta}}{2}$:\n$$ \\langle (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\beta k_{\\theta}}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\beta k_{\\theta}} $$\nFinally, substituting $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$$ \\langle (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2 \\rangle = \\frac{k_B T}{k_{\\theta}} $$\nThis is the desired analytic expression for the temperature dependence of $\\langle (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2 \\rangle$ to leading order in $k_B T / k_{\\theta}$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to assess the validity of the equipartition theorem. The theorem states that, for a classical system in thermal equilibrium, every degree of freedom that appears quadratically in the total energy has a mean energy of $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T$.\nThe bending potential energy is $U_{\\text{bend}}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\theta} (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2$. This is a quadratic function of the coordinate $(\\theta - \\theta_0)$.\nThe mean potential energy contribution from bending is:\n$$ \\langle U_{\\text{bend}} \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\theta} (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\theta} \\langle (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2 \\rangle $$\nSubstituting the result we derived for $\\langle (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2 \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle U_{\\text{bend}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\theta} \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{k_{\\theta}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} k_B T $$\nThis result is precisely what the equipartition theorem predicts for a single quadratic degree of freedom. Therefore, our derivation confirms that the equipartition theorem is valid for the bending energy contribution in the harmonic, small-fluctuation regime. The approximations made (approximating $\\sin(\\theta)$ as constant and extending integration limits) are the same approximations under which the equipartition theorem is expected to hold for such a coordinate.",
