A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Dimensionless Group**\n\nThe motion of an incompressible, viscous Newtonian fluid is described by the momentum balance equation, also known as the Navier-Stokes equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector, $t$ is time, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. For this problem, the flow is specified as steady, which means the time derivative term $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t}$ is zero. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nThe term on the left, $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$, represents the inertial forces per unit volume. The term $\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$ represents the viscous forces per unit volume.\n\nTo derive the dimensionless group, we nondimensionalize the equation using the characteristic scales provided: length $L$ and velocity $U$. We define the following dimensionless variables, denoted by an asterisk:\n- Dimensionless velocity: $\\mathbf{v}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{U}$\n- Dimensionless position: $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{L}$\n- The gradient operator consequently scales as: $\\nabla = \\frac{1}{L} \\nabla^*$\n- We choose a characteristic pressure scale based on inertial effects, $P_c = \\rho U^2$. The dimensionless pressure is: $p^* = \\frac{p}{\\rho U^2}$\n\nSubstituting these dimensionless variables into the steady-state momentum equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( (U \\mathbf{v}^*) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\nabla^*\\right) \\right) (U \\mathbf{v}^*) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\nabla^*\\right) (\\rho U^2 p^*) + \\mu \\left(\\frac{1}{L^2} \\nabla^{*2}\\right) (U \\mathbf{v}^*)\n$$\nFactoring out the dimensional coefficients from each term:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\rho U^2}{L} \\right) (\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^* = -\\left( \\frac{\\rho U^2}{L} \\right) \\nabla^* p^* + \\left( \\frac{\\mu U}{L^2} \\right) \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{v}^*\n$$\nTo find the relative importance of the inertial and viscous terms, we can divide the entire equation by the coefficient of the inertial term, $\\frac{\\rho U^2}{L}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^* = -\\nabla^* p^* + \\frac{\\mu U / L^2}{\\rho U^2 / L} \\nabla^{*2} \\mathbf{v}^*\n$$\nThe dimensionless coefficient pre-multiplying the viscous term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu U / L^2}{\\rho U^2 / L} = \\frac{\\mu U}{L^2} \\frac{L}{\\rho U^2} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho U L}\n$$\nThe dimensionless group that quantifies the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces is the reciprocal of this coefficient.

From dimensional analysis of the diffusion term ($[D] = \\mathrm{length}^2/\\mathrm{time}$), this time is given by:\n$$ \\tau_{diff} = \\frac{L^2}{D} $$\nThe competition between advection and diffusion is quantified by comparing the relative rates of these processes. The rate of a process is inversely proportional to its characteristic time. The Péclet number, $Pe$, is defined as the ratio of the advective transport rate to the diffusive transport rate.\n$$ Pe = \\frac{\\text{Rate of Advection}}{\\text{Rate of Diffusion}} = \\frac{1/\\tau_{adv}}{1/\\tau_{diff}} = \\frac{\\tau_{diff}}{\\tau_{adv}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the timescales, we derive the expression for the Péclet number:\n$$ Pe = \\frac{\\frac{L^2}{D}}{\\frac{L}{U}} = \\frac{UL}{D} $$\nNow, we can establish the criterion for dominance.\n-   If $Pe \\gg 1$, then $\\tau_{diff} \\gg \\tau_{adv}$. This implies that the time taken for diffusion is much longer than the time taken for advection over the same length scale. Therefore, advection is the dominant transport mechanism.\n-   If $Pe \\ll 1$, then $\\tau_{diff} \\ll \\tau_{adv}$. This implies that diffusion is a much faster process than advection over the length scale $L$, and diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism.\n\nWe now compute the value of the Péclet number for the given system using the values in SI units.\n-   $U = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n-   $L = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $D = 1.20 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$\n\n$$ Pe = \\frac{(8.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m/s}) (7.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.20 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}} $$\n$$ Pe = \\frac{60 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.20 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.20 \\times 10^{-10}} $$\n$$ Pe = 5.0 \\times 10^5 $$\nThe problem requires rounding $Pe$ to four significant figures.\n$$ Pe = 5.000 \\times 10^5 $$\nSince $Pe = 5.0 \\times 10^5 \\gg 1$, the system is strongly advection-dominated.

The solution will proceed by first estimating the characteristic extensional rate at the stagnation point, then calculating the corresponding Weissenberg number, and finally using this dimensionless number to assess the physical basis for the observed optical phenomena.\n\n1.  **Estimation of the Characteristic Extensional Rate, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$**\n\nA Cartesian coordinate system is established with its origin, $(0,0)$, at the geometric center of the cross-slot, which corresponds to a stagnation point in the flow. The inlet channels are aligned with the y-axis, and the outlet channels are aligned with the x-axis. For a steady, inertia-free, and incompressible flow, the velocity field near the stagnation point can be locally approximated as a linear planar extensional flow:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}(x, y) = (v_x, v_y) = (\\dot{\\varepsilon}x, -\\dot{\\varepsilon}y) $$\nHere, $x$ and $y$ are the spatial coordinates, $v_x$ and $v_y$ are the velocity components, and $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is the constant planar extensional rate. This form of the velocity field intrinsically satisfies the incompressibility condition for a two-dimensional flow, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial y} = \\dot{\\varepsilon} - \\dot{\\varepsilon} = 0$.\n\nTo estimate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ from the given macroscopic flow parameters, namely the average inlet speed $U$ and the channel width $L$, we employ a scaling analysis. Consider a fluid element moving along the extensional outflow centerline, where $y=0$. The velocity of this element is given by $v_x(x,0) = \\dot{\\varepsilon}x$. This element accelerates from a velocity of $v_x(0,0)=0$ at the stagnation point. We can relate the local kinematics to the global flow rate by assuming that the velocity along this centerline reaches a magnitude comparable to the average channel velocity $U$ at a characteristic distance from the center. A natural choice for this distance is the channel half-width, $x=L/2$. This leads to the approximation:\n$$ v_x\\left(\\frac{L}{2}, 0\\right) = \\dot{\\varepsilon}\\frac{L}{2} \\approx U $$\nSolving for the extensional rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ yields the following standard estimate for cross-slot devices:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon} \\approx \\frac{2U}{L} $$\n\n2.  **Calculation of the Weissenberg Number, $Wi$**\n\nThe Weissenberg number, $Wi$, is a dimensionless parameter crucial for describing viscoelastic flow phenomena. It represents the ratio of the characteristic relaxation time of the fluid, $\\lambda$, to a characteristic timescale of the flow. In a steady extensional flow, the flow timescale is the inverse of the strain rate, $\\frac{1}{\\dot{\\varepsilon}}$. The Weissenberg number is thus defined as:\n$$ Wi = \\lambda \\dot{\\varepsilon} $$\nSubstituting the previously derived estimate for $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$ Wi = \\lambda \\left(\\frac{2U}{L}\\right) $$\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n- Average inlet speed, $U = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Channel width, $L = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Polymer relaxation time, $\\lambda = 1.20 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of the extensional rate, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$:\n$$ \\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{2 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{6.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4}}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 60\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nNext, we compute the Weissenberg number:\n$$ Wi = (1.20 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times (60\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 7.2 $$\nAs per the problem's instruction to round the final answer to three significant figures, we have:\n$$ Wi = 7.20 $$\n\n3.  **Assessment of the Coil–Stretch Transition**\n\nThe final task is to assess whether the observation of a \"strong, steady birefringence pattern observed along the outflow centerlines\" is consistent with fundamental criteria for polymer stretching. Flow-induced birefringence in a polymer solution is a direct consequence of the anisotropic orientation and deformation of polymer chains. A strong birefringence signal indicates that the polymer chains are, on average, highly aligned and stretched.\n\nThe coil–stretch transition is a critical phenomenon in polymer rheology where flexible macromolecules in a dilute solution undergo a rapid and substantial elongation from a compact, random coil state to a highly stretched conformation. This transition is driven by the hydrodynamic forces of a strong extensional flow.\n\nThe criterion for the onset of the coil–stretch transition in a steady, planar extensional flow is governed by the Weissenberg number. Based on first-principles theoretical models, the transition is predicted to occur when the Weissenberg number exceeds a critical value, $Wi_{crit}$:\n$$ Wi_{crit} = 0.5 $$\nOur calculated Weissenberg number for the flow in the cross-slot is $Wi = 7.20$. Comparing this value to the critical threshold:\n$$ Wi = 7.20 \\gg Wi_{crit} = 0.5 $$\nThe condition for the coil-stretch transition is clearly met and substantially exceeded. The flow is in a \"strong\" regime, where the extensional forces are more than sufficient to overcome the entropic tendency of the polymer chains to remain coiled. The outflow centerlines represent the streamlines of highest strain and longest residence time for fluid elements passing near the stagnation point. Consequently, polymers traveling along these paths are subjected to the ideal conditions for maximal stretching.\n\nTherefore, the observation of a strong and steady birefringence pattern localized along the outflow centerlines is fully consistent with the theoretical prediction of a coil–stretch transition occurring for $Wi > 0.5$. The high value of $Wi$ confirms that the flow is strong enough to induce significant polymer chain extension and alignment, which is the physical origin of the observed strong birefringence.",
