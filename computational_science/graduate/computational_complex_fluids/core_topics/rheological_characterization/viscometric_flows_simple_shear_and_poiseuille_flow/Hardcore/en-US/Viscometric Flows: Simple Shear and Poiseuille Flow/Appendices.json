For a velocity field $\\boldsymbol{v}=(u, v, w)$ and pressure $p$, and with negligible body forces, these are:\n\nContinuity:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n\nNavier-Stokes (momentum balance):\n$$ \\rho(\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{v} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{v} $$\nIn component form:\n$x$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho\\left(u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + w\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}\\right) $$\n$y$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho\\left(u\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + w\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2}\\right) $$\n$z$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho\\left(u\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} + w\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial z^2}\\right) $$\n\n**1. Simplification of the Velocity Field**\n\nWe start with the most general form $\\boldsymbol{v}(x,y,z) = (u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z), w(x,y,z))$ and apply the problem's constraints.\n\n-   **Infinite plates in the $x$ and $z$ directions:** This geometric configuration implies translational symmetry along the $z$-axis. Consequently, all physical quantities, including the velocity components and pressure, must be independent of $z$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = 0$ for all flow variables. The velocity field simplifies to $\\boldsymbol{v} = (u(x,y), v(x,y), w(x,y))$.\n\n-   **Fully developed flow:** This assumption means the velocity profile does not change in the primary flow direction, which is $x$. This implies $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$. Therefore, $u$ can only be a function of $y$, so $u=u(y)$.\n\n-   **Application to the continuity equation:** With $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}=0$, the continuity equation $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0$ reduces to $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$. This implies that $v$ is not a function of $y$. Since we already established $v$ is independent of $z$, $v$ can only be a function of $x$, i.e., $v = v(x)$.\n\n-   **No-penetration boundary condition:** The fluid cannot pass through the solid plates at $y=\\pm H$. This requires the velocity component normal to the plates to be zero: $v(y=H)=0$ and $v(y=-H)=0$. Since we found that $v=v(x)$ and does not depend on $y$, the condition $v=0$ at the boundaries implies that $v$ must be zero everywhere. Thus, $v(x,y,z) = 0$.\n\n-   **Analysis of the $z$-component of velocity, $w$:** We currently have $\\boldsymbol{v} = (u(y), 0, w(x,y))$. The no-slip boundary condition at the plates requires $w(x, y=\\pm H) = 0$. The driving force is a pressure gradient only in the $x$-direction, meaning there is no external mechanism to induce flow in the $z$-direction. Physical intuition and the symmetry of the problem (invariance under the coordinate transformation $z \\to -z$) suggest that $w$ must be zero. If there were a flow in the $z$-direction, say $w > 0$, there would be no reason why it shouldn't be $w < 0$ instead, as the physical problem statement is identical for both cases. The only consistent solution is $w=0$.\n    Formally, looking at the $z$-momentum equation: with $v=0$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}=0$, and no pressure gradient in the $z$-direction ($\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}=0$ due to symmetry), the equation becomes $\\rho u(y) \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} \\right)$. With boundary conditions $w(x, y=\\pm H) = 0$ and the implicit condition that the flow is bounded as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, the only physically acceptable solution is the trivial one, $w(x,y) = 0$.\n\n-   **Final velocity field form:** Based on the analysis above, the velocity field simplifies to $\\boldsymbol{v} = (u(y), 0, 0)$.\n\n**2. Derivation and Solution of the ODE for $u(y)$**\n\nWe substitute $\\boldsymbol{v}=(u(y), 0, 0)$ back into the simplified Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n-   From the $y$-momentum and $z$-momentum equations:\n    $$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n    $$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n    These results show that the pressure $p$ is a function only of $x$, so $p=p(x)$.\n\n-   From the $x$-momentum equation:\n    $$ \\rho\\left(u(y)\\frac{\\partial u(y)}{\\partial x} + 0 + 0\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u(y)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u(y)}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u(y)}{\\partial z^2}\\right) $$\n    Since $u$ depends only on $y$, its derivatives with respect to $x$ and $z$ are zero. The equation reduces to:\n    $$ 0 = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\mu \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d}y^2} $$\n    Here we use total derivatives as $p$ depends only on $x$ and $u$ only on $y$. Rearranging gives:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d}y^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x} $$\n    The problem states that the pressure gradient $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ is a constant. Let's denote $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ as the given positive constant gradient.\n\n-   Integrating the ODE twice with respect to $y$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}y + C_1 $$\n    $$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\n\n-   Applying the no-slip boundary conditions, $u(y=\\pm H) = 0$:\n    At $y=H$: $u(H) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}H^2 + C_1 H + C_2 = 0$.\n    At $y=-H$: $u(-H) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}(-H)^2 + C_1(-H) + C_2 = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}H^2 - C_1 H + C_2 = 0$.\n    Subtracting the second equation from the first yields $2C_1H = 0$, which implies $C_1=0$ since $H \\neq 0$.\n    Substituting $C_1=0$ into the first equation gives $C_2 = -\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}H^2$.\n\n-   The final velocity profile is:\n    $$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}y^2 - \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}H^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}(y^2 - H^2) $$\n    Rewriting this in terms of the given positive constant $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$:\n    $$ u(y) = -\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)(y^2 - H^2) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)(H^2 - y^2) $$\n    This is the parabolic velocity profile characteristic of plane Poiseuille flow.\n\n**3. Kinematic Tensors**\n\nGiven the velocity field $\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)(H^2 - y^2), 0, 0\\right)$, we compute the required tensors.\n\n-   **Velocity gradient tensor $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v}$:**\n    The only non-zero component of the gradient is $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)(-2y) = -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) $$\n    The tensor is therefore:\n    $$ \\nabla \\boldsymbol{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n-   **Rate-of-deformation tensor $\\boldsymbol{D}$:**\n    $\\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v} + (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v})^{\\mathsf{T}})$.\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] $$\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{y}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{y}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n-   **Spin tensor $\\boldsymbol{W}$:**\n    $\\boldsymbol{W} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v} - (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v})^{\\mathsf{T}})$.\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{W} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] $$\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{W} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{y}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) & 0 \\\\ \\frac{y}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe requested final answer is the analytical expression for $u(y)$.",

            "problem": "You are asked to design and implement a computational procedure that resolves startup transients in simple shear for a Maxwell-type fluid, and to validate the discrete stress evolution against an analytic stress-growth curve derived from the governing equations. The computational design must comprise both a one-dimensional spatial mesh across the shear gap and an explicit time-stepping scheme for the constitutive dynamics. The physical setting is planar Couette shear between two parallel plates separated by a gap of height $H$, with the bottom plate at rest and the top plate impulsively set to a constant speed $U$ at time $t=0^{+}$. Under no-slip boundary conditions, the imposed kinematics produce a uniform simple shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$ across the gap.\n\nStart from the following context-appropriate fundamental base:\n- Continuum kinematics for simple shear: the velocity field $v_{x}(y,t)$ and its gradient define the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)=\\partial v_{x}(y,t)/\\partial y$.\n- The linear Maxwell constitutive model for the shear component of the extra stress $ \\tau \\equiv \\tau_{xy} $ under an imposed shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$: the shear stress satisfies the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $ \\tau(t) + \\lambda \\,\\dot{\\tau}(t) = \\eta \\,\\dot{\\gamma}(t) $, where $ \\lambda $ is the relaxation time and $ \\eta $ is the viscosity.\n\nYour program must implement:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and rheology, specifically the linear Maxwell model for viscoelastic fluids. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear governing ordinary differential equation (ODE), an initial condition, and a complete set of physical and numerical parameters. The objective is clearly defined: to implement a specific numerical scheme (forward Euler), compare it against the analytical solution, and compute a specified error metric. The language is precise and objective. All parameters are physically plausible and internally consistent. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the linear Maxwell constitutive equation for the shear stress $\\tau$ under a startup flow condition.\n\n**1. Governing Equation and Analytical Solution**\n\nThe governing equation for the shear stress component $\\tau(t) \\equiv \\tau_{xy}(t)$ in a linear Maxwell fluid under a time-dependent shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ is given as a first-order linear ODE:\n$$\n\\tau(t) + \\lambda \\frac{d\\tau(t)}{dt} = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the relaxation time and $\\eta$ is the zero-shear viscosity.\n\nThe physical scenario is a startup of simple shear flow, where the fluid is at rest for $t<0$ and a constant shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma} = U/H$ is applied for all $t \\geq 0$. The initial condition is that the fluid is stress-free, so $\\tau(0) = 0$. For $t > 0$, the ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\lambda \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} + \\tau = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nThis is a standard non-homogeneous first-order linear ODE. The solution consists of a homogeneous part and a particular (steady-state) solution. The steady-state solution, achieved as $t \\to \\infty$, is found by setting the time derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\infty} = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\lambda \\frac{d\\tau_h}{dt} + \\tau_h = 0$, which has the solution $\\tau_h(t) = C e^{-t/\\lambda}$ for some constant $C$. The general solution is the sum of the steady-state and homogeneous solutions:\n$$\n\\tau(t) = \\tau_{\\infty} + C e^{-t/\\lambda}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ is determined by the initial condition $\\tau(0)=0$:\n$$\n\\tau(0) = 0 = \\tau_{\\infty} + C e^0 \\implies C = -\\tau_{\\infty}\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the general solution gives the analytical stress-growth function:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{analytic}}(t) = \\tau_{\\infty} (1 - e^{-t/\\lambda}) = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma} (1 - e^{-t/\\lambda})\n$$\nThis equation provides the exact value of the shear stress at any time $t \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Numerical Discretization and Stability**\n\nThe problem requires a forward Euler explicit time-stepping scheme. We first rearrange the governing ODE to isolate the time derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} (\\eta \\dot{\\gamma} - \\tau)\n$$\nDiscretizing this equation using a forward difference for the time derivative, $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} \\approx \\frac{\\tau^{n+1} - \\tau^n}{\\Delta t}$, where $\\tau^n = \\tau(t_n)$ and $t_n = n \\Delta t$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau^{n+1} - \\tau^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} (\\eta \\dot{\\gamma} - \\tau^n)\n$$\nSolving for the stress at the next time step, $\\tau^{n+1}$, yields the iterative formula:\n$$\n\\tau^{n+1} = \\tau^n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda} (\\eta \\dot{\\gamma} - \\tau^n) = \\tau^n \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda}\\right) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda} \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nThis formula allows us to compute the stress at time $t_{n+1}$ based on its value at time $t_n$. Starting with $\\tau^0 = 0$, we can march forward in time up to $T_{\\text{end}}$.\n\nThe stability of this explicit scheme depends on the amplification factor of the $\\tau^n$ term, which is $(1 - \\Delta t/\\lambda)$. For a stable solution, the magnitude of this factor must be less than or equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\left|1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda}\\right| \\le 1 \\implies -1 \\le 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda} \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality yields the stability criterion $\\Delta t \\le 2\\lambda$. If $\\Delta t > 2\\lambda$, the numerical solution will exhibit unphysical oscillations that grow exponentially, leading to instability. The test cases are designed to probe this limit: Cases $1$, $2$, and $4$ are stable ($\\Delta t/\\lambda < 2$), while Case $3$ is unstable ($\\Delta t/\\lambda = 2.1 > 2$).\n\n**3. Spatial Considerations**\n\nThe problem specifies a one-dimensional mesh of $N$ nodes across the gap $[0,H]$. However, it also states that the kinematics impose a *uniform* simple shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}=U/H$ across the entire gap for all $t > 0$. Since the governing ODE for $\\tau$ depends only on $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ and not on the spatial coordinate $y$, the ODE is identical at every point in the domain. Given a uniform initial condition $\\tau(y,0)=0$, the stress evolution $\\tau(y,t)$ must also be uniform in space, i.e., $\\tau(y,t) = \\tau(t)$.\n\nConsequently, the simulation is effectively zero-dimensional in space; we only need to solve a single ODE in time. The domain-averaged discrete stress $\\overline{\\tau}(t_n)$ is simply the stress value $\\tau^n$ computed at any single point. The number of nodes $N$ is therefore an extraneous parameter for this specific problem formulation, as the solution is identical at all nodes.\n\n**4. Error Metric Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to compute the normalized root-mean-square (RMS) deviation, $E$. The computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For a given test case, calculate the constant parameters: $\\dot{\\gamma} = U/H$ and $\\tau_{\\infty} = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}$.\n2. Determine the number of time steps $M = T_{\\text{end}}/\\Delta t$ and create an array of time points $t_n = n \\Delta t$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, M$.\n3. Compute the analytical solution $\\tau_{\\text{analytic}}(t_n)$ for all time points.\n4. Compute the numerical solution $\\tau^n$ for all time points using the forward Euler iteration, starting from $\\tau^0=0$.\n5. Calculate the sum of squared differences: $S = \\sum_{n=0}^{M} (\\tau^n - \\tau_{\\text{analytic}}(t_n))^2$.\n6. Compute the final error metric $E$ as per the formula:\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{S}{M+1}}}{\\tau_{\\infty}}\n$$\nThis procedure is repeated for each of the four test cases. For the unstable case, the numerical values for $\\tau^n$ will grow very large, and the resulting error $E$ is expected to be extremely large or reported as infinity (`inf`), which is the correct outcome reflecting the breakdown of the numerical method.",
