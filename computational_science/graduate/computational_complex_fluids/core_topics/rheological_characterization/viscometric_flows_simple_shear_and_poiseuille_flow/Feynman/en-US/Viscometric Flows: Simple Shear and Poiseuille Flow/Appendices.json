For a velocity field $\\boldsymbol{v}=(u, v, w)$ and pressure $p$, and with negligible body forces, these are:\n\nContinuity:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n\nNavier-Stokes (momentum balance):\n$$ \\rho(\\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{v} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\boldsymbol{v} $$\nIn component form:\n$x$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho\\left(u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + w\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}\\right) $$\n$y$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho\\left(u\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + w\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2}\\right) $$\n$z$-momentum:\n$$ \\rho\\left(u\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} + w\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial z^2}\\right) $$\n\n**1. Simplification of the Velocity Field**\n\nWe start with the most general form $\\boldsymbol{v}(x,y,z) = (u(x,y,z), v(x,y,z), w(x,y,z))$ and apply the problem's constraints.\n\n-   **Infinite plates in the $x$ and $z$ directions:** This geometric configuration implies translational symmetry along the $z$-axis. Consequently, all physical quantities, including the velocity components and pressure, must be independent of $z$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = 0$ for all flow variables. The velocity field simplifies to $\\boldsymbol{v} = (u(x,y), v(x,y), w(x,y))$.\n\n-   **Fully developed flow:** This assumption means the velocity profile does not change in the primary flow direction, which is $x$. This implies $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$. Therefore, $u$ can only be a function of $y$, so $u=u(y)$.\n\n-   **Application to the continuity equation:** With $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}=0$ and $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z}=0$, the continuity equation $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0$ reduces to $\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0$. This implies that $v$ is not a function of $y$. Since we already established $v$ is independent of $z$, $v$ can only be a function of $x$, i.e., $v = v(x)$.\n\n-   **No-penetration boundary condition:** The fluid cannot pass through the solid plates at $y=\\pm H$. This requires the velocity component normal to the plates to be zero: $v(y=H)=0$ and $v(y=-H)=0$. Since we found that $v=v(x)$ and does not depend on $y$, the condition $v=0$ at the boundaries implies that $v$ must be zero everywhere. Thus, $v(x,y,z) = 0$.\n\n-   **Analysis of the $z$-component of velocity, $w$:** We currently have $\\boldsymbol{v} = (u(y), 0, w(x,y))$. The no-slip boundary condition at the plates requires $w(x, y=\\pm H) = 0$. The driving force is a pressure gradient only in the $x$-direction, meaning there is no external mechanism to induce flow in the $z$-direction. Physical intuition and the symmetry of the problem (invariance under the coordinate transformation $z \\to -z$) suggest that $w$ must be zero. If there were a flow in the $z$-direction, say $w  0$, there would be no reason why it shouldn't be $w  0$ instead, as the physical problem statement is identical for both cases. The only consistent solution is $w=0$.\n    Formally, looking at the $z$-momentum equation: with $v=0$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}=0$, and no pressure gradient in the $z$-direction ($\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}=0$ due to symmetry), the equation becomes $\\rho u(y) \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 w}{\\partial y^2} \\right)$. With boundary conditions $w(x, y=\\pm H) = 0$ and the implicit condition that the flow is bounded as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, the only physically acceptable solution is the trivial one, $w(x,y) = 0$.\n\n-   **Final velocity field form:** Based on the analysis above, the velocity field simplifies to $\\boldsymbol{v} = (u(y), 0, 0)$.\n\n**2. Derivation and Solution of the ODE for $u(y)$**\n\nWe substitute $\\boldsymbol{v}=(u(y), 0, 0)$ back into the simplified Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n-   From the $y$-momentum and $z$-momentum equations:\n    $$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} + 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n    $$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n    These results show that the pressure $p$ is a function only of $x$, so $p=p(x)$.\n\n-   From the $x$-momentum equation:\n    $$ \\rho\\left(u(y)\\frac{\\partial u(y)}{\\partial x} + 0 + 0\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u(y)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u(y)}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u(y)}{\\partial z^2}\\right) $$\n    Since $u$ depends only on $y$, its derivatives with respect to $x$ and $z$ are zero. The equation reduces to:\n    $$ 0 = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\mu \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d}y^2} $$\n    Here we use total derivatives as $p$ depends only on $x$ and $u$ only on $y$. Rearranging gives:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 u}{\\mathrm{d}y^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x} $$\n    The problem states that the pressure gradient $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ is a constant. Let's denote $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ as the given positive constant gradient.\n\n-   Integrating the ODE twice with respect to $y$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}y + C_1 $$\n    $$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\n\n-   Applying the no-slip boundary conditions, $u(y=\\pm H) = 0$:\n    At $y=H$: $u(H) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}H^2 + C_1 H + C_2 = 0$.\n    At $y=-H$: $u(-H) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}(-H)^2 + C_1(-H) + C_2 = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}H^2 - C_1 H + C_2 = 0$.\n    Subtracting the second equation from the first yields $2C_1H = 0$, which implies $C_1=0$ since $H \\neq 0$.\n    Substituting $C_1=0$ into the first equation gives $C_2 = -\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}H^2$.\n\n-   The final velocity profile is:\n    $$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}y^2 - \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}H^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}(y^2 - H^2) $$\n    Rewriting this in terms of the given positive constant $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}$:\n    $$ u(y) = -\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)(y^2 - H^2) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)(H^2 - y^2) $$\n    This is the parabolic velocity profile characteristic of plane Poiseuille flow.\n\n**3. Kinematic Tensors**\n\nGiven the velocity field $\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)(H^2 - y^2), 0, 0\\right)$, we compute the required tensors.\n\n-   **Velocity gradient tensor $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v}$:**\n    The only non-zero component of the gradient is $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)(-2y) = -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right) $$\n    The tensor is therefore:\n    $$ \\nabla \\boldsymbol{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y}  \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n-   **Rate-of-deformation tensor $\\boldsymbol{D}$:**\n    $\\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v} + (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v})^{\\mathsf{T}})$.\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] $$\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -\\frac{y}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)  0 \\\\ -\\frac{y}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n-   **Spin tensor $\\boldsymbol{W}$:**\n    $\\boldsymbol{W} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v} - (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{v})^{\\mathsf{T}})$.\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{W} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ -\\frac{y}{\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] $$\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{W} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -\\frac{y}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)  0 \\\\ \\frac{y}{2\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe requested final answer is the analytical expression for $u(y)$.",

Which statement below is most accurate?\n\nA. Only the Bingham plastic can produce a finite central plug in slit Poiseuille flow, and this occurs whenever the wall shear stress exceeds the yield stress; the power-law and Carreau fluids have no true plug because they lack a yield stress and satisfy $\\dot{\\gamma}(y) \\ne 0$ for every $y \\ne 0$, albeit with a blunted profile near $y=0$.\n\nB.

The Carreau and Bingham fluids both develop central plugs under sufficiently small $|\\partial p/\\partial x|$ because the Carreau model’s finite zero-shear viscosity $\\eta_0$ implies vanishing shear rate over a finite neighborhood of the centerline.\n\nD. None of the three develop a finite central plug in slit flow, because the shear stress vanishes only at the centerline and there is no yield stress in any of the models.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of fluid mechanics and rheology, well-posed with a clear question and sufficient information, and expressed in objective, technical language. The setup describes a canonical problem (planar Poiseuille flow) for several standard generalized Newtonian fluid models.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine which of the three fluid models can exhibit a finite-width central plug, defined as a region where the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(y) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$ is zero over a finite interval around the centerline $y=0$.\n\nFirst, we determine the shear stress profile, which is independent of the fluid's constitutive relation. The streamwise momentum balance is given as:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial y}\n$$\nLet the constant pressure gradient term be $G = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$. Since the flow is in the positive $x$-direction, $G  0$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tau_{xy}}{\\partial y} = -G\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $y$ yields:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy}(y) = -Gy + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. The problem states that symmetry implies $\\tau_{xy}(0) = 0$. Applying this condition:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy}(0) = -G(0) + C = 0 \\implies C = 0\n$$\nThus, the shear stress profile is linear across the channel:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy}(y) = -Gy\n$$\nThe magnitude of the shear stress is $|\\tau_{xy}(y)| = G|y|$. This shows that the shear stress is zero only at the centerline ($y=0$) and increases linearly in magnitude towards the walls.\n\nA central plug of finite width exists if there is a region $|y| \\le y_p$ with $y_p  0$ where $\\dot{\\gamma}(y) = 0$. We now analyze this condition for each fluid model. For viscometric flows, viscosity is a function of the shear rate magnitude, $|\\dot{\\gamma}|$. We interpret the given viscosity functions accordingly, i.e., $\\eta = \\eta(|\\dot{\\gamma}|)$, and relate stress and shear rate by $\\tau_{xy} = \\eta(|\\dot{\\gamma}|)\\dot{\\gamma}$.\n\n**1. Bingham Plastic**\nThe constitutive model is defined as:\n- $\\dot{\\gamma} = 0$ for $|\\tau_{xy}| \\le \\tau_y$\n- $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_y\\,\\mathrm{sgn}(\\dot{\\gamma}) + \\mu_p\\,\\dot{\\gamma}$ for $|\\tau_{xy}|  \\tau_y$\nThe condition for a region to be unyielded (i.e., a plug where $\\dot{\\gamma}=0$) is that the magnitude of the local shear stress does not exceed the yield stress $\\tau_y$.\nUsing our derived stress profile, $|\\tau_{xy}(y)| = G|y|$, the condition for a plug is:\n$$\nG|y| \\le \\tau_y\n$$\n$$\n|y| \\le \\frac{\\tau_y}{G}\n$$\nSince $\\tau_y  0$ and $G  0$, this inequality defines a finite interval $[-y_p, y_p]$ where $y_p = \\tau_y/G  0$. Therefore, the Bingham plastic model predicts a central plug of finite width $2y_p$. This plug exists as long as flow occurs, which requires the wall shear stress $|\\tau_{xy}(h)| = Gh$ to be greater than the yield stress $\\tau_y$. If $Gh \\le \\tau_y$, the entire channel is plugged and there is no flow.\n\n**2. Carreau Fluid**\nThe viscosity function is $\\eta(|\\dot{\\gamma}|)=\\eta_\\infty+(\\eta_0-\\eta_\\infty)\\left[1+(\\lambda\\,|\\dot{\\gamma}|)^2\\right]^{(m-1)/2}$. A key property is that the zero-shear-rate viscosity is finite and non-zero: $\\eta(|\\dot{\\gamma}| \\to 0) = \\eta_0  0$.\nThe stress is given by $\\tau_{xy} = \\eta(|\\dot{\\gamma}|) \\dot{\\gamma}$. If a plug exists, then $\\dot{\\gamma}=0$. In this case, the stress is:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy} = \\eta(0) \\cdot 0 = \\eta_0 \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThis means that for a Carreau fluid, a plug can only exist where the shear stress is exactly zero. From the stress profile $\\tau_{xy}(y) = -Gy$, the stress is zero only at the single point $y=0$. Therefore, $\\dot{\\gamma}(y)$ is zero only at $y=0$, and there is no finite-width central plug. For any $y \\ne 0$, there is a non-zero stress, which induces a non-zero shear rate. The velocity profile is blunted near the center because the viscosity is highest there, but it is not perfectly flat over any finite interval.\n\n**3. Shear-thinning Power-law Fluid**\nThe constitutive relation is $\\tau_{xy} = \\eta(|\\dot{\\gamma}|)\\dot{\\gamma}$ with $\\eta(|\\dot{\\gamma}|) = K|\\dot{\\gamma}|^{n-1}$ where $0n1$. This can be written as $\\tau_{xy} = K|\\dot{\\gamma}|^n \\mathrm{sgn}(\\dot{\\gamma})$.\nFor a plug to exist, we must have $\\dot{\\gamma}=0$. If $\\dot{\\gamma}=0$, the stress is:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy} = K|0|^n \\mathrm{sgn}(0) = 0\n$$\nSimilar to the Carreau fluid, a plug can only form where the shear stress is zero. Since $\\tau_{xy}(y) = -Gy$ is zero only at $y=0$, the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(y)$ can only be zero at $y=0$. There is no finite-width plug.\nThe divergence of the viscosity as $|\\dot{\\gamma}| \\to 0$ (since $n-1  0$) does not create a yield stress. We can solve for the shear rate explicitly:\n$$\n-Gy = K|\\dot{\\gamma}|^n \\mathrm{sgn}(\\dot{\\gamma})\n$$\nFor $y0$, we have $\\tau_{xy}  0$, so we expect $\\dot{\\gamma}0$. This gives:\n$$\n-Gy = -K(-\\dot{\\gamma})^n \\implies (-\\dot{\\gamma})^n = \\frac{G}{K}y \\implies \\dot{\\gamma}(y) = -\\left(\\frac{Gy}{K}\\right)^{1/n}\n$$\nSince $y0$, $G0$, $K0$, the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(y)$ is non-zero for any $y0$.\nLike the Carreau model, the power-law model produces a blunted velocity profile, but not a true plug.\n\n**Summary of Analysis:**\n- **Bingham plastic:** A finite-width central plug exists.\n- **Carreau fluid:** No finite-width plug exists.\n- **Power-law fluid:** No finite-width plug exists.\n\nA true plug requires a yield stress, a stress threshold below which the material does not deform. Among the three models, only the Bingham plastic has this property.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. Only the Bingham plastic can produce a finite central plug in slit Poiseuille flow, and this occurs whenever the wall shear stress exceeds the yield stress; the power-law and Carreau fluids have no true plug because they lack a yield stress and satisfy $\\dot{\\gamma}(y) \\ne 0$ for every $y \\ne 0$, albeit with a blunted profile near $y=0$.**\nThis statement is the most accurate description of the physics.\n- \"Only the Bingham plastic can produce a finite central plug\": **Correct**.\n- \"this occurs whenever the wall shear stress exceeds the yield stress\": **Correct**. This condition ensures that the fluid is flowing and the plug does not occupy the entire channel.\n- \"the power-law and Carreau fluids have no true plug because they lack a yield stress\": **Correct**. This is the fundamental reason.\n- \"and satisfy $\\dot{\\gamma}(y) \\ne 0$ for every $y \\ne 0$\": **Correct**.\n- \"albeit with a blunted profile near $y=0$\": **Correct**. Both models are shear-thinning, which leads to profiles that are flatter near the center than the Newtonian parabola.\nConsidering all points, this option is the most accurate description of the physics.\n\n**B. Both the Bingham plastic and the shear-thinning power-law fluid produce finite central plugs; for the power-law fluid, the divergence of $\\eta(\\dot{\\gamma})$ as $\\dot{\\gamma}\\to 0$ is sufficient to create a plug region.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The power-law fluid does not produce a finite plug. The divergent viscosity at zero shear rate is not equivalent to a yield stress.\n\n**C. The Carreau and Bingham fluids both develop central plugs under sufficiently small $|\\partial p/\\partial x|$ because the Carreau model’s finite zero-shear viscosity $\\eta_0$ implies vanishing shear rate over a finite neighborhood of the centerline.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The Carreau fluid does not form a plug. The reasoning provided is also flawed; a finite $\\eta_0$ implies Newtonian behavior at low shear rates, for which $\\dot{\\gamma}=0$ only if $\\tau_{xy}=0$.\n\n**D. None of the three develop a finite central plug in slit flow, because the shear stress vanishes only at the centerline and there is no yield stress in any of the models.**\nThis is **Incorrect**. The Bingham plastic does develop a finite plug. The statement incorrectly claims that none of the models have a yield stress, which is false for the Bingham plastic.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly identifies which fluid forms a plug and provides the correct physical reasoning. The original `γ̇(y)>0` has been corrected to `γ̇(y)≠0` for clarity on non-zero magnitude and to avoid sign issues.",

The computational design must comprise both a one-dimensional spatial mesh across the shear gap and an explicit time-stepping scheme for the constitutive dynamics. The physical setting is planar Couette shear between two parallel plates separated by a gap of height $H$, with the bottom plate at rest and the top plate impulsively set to a constant speed $U$ at time $t=0^{+}$. Under no-slip boundary conditions, the imposed kinematics produce a uniform simple shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$ across the gap.\n\nStart from the following context-appropriate fundamental base:\n- Continuum kinematics for simple shear: the velocity field $v_{x}(y,t)$ and its gradient define the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)=\\partial v_{x}(y,t)/\\partial y$.\n- The linear Maxwell constitutive model for the shear component of the extra stress $\\tau \\equiv \\tau_{xy}$ under an imposed shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$: the shear stress satisfies the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\tau(t) + \\lambda \\,\\dot{\\tau}(t) = \\eta \\,\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, where $\\lambda$ is the relaxation time and $\\eta$ is the viscosity.\n\nYour program must implement:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and rheology, specifically the linear Maxwell model for viscoelastic fluids. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear governing ordinary differential equation (ODE), an initial condition, and a complete set of physical and numerical parameters. The objective is clearly defined: to implement a specific numerical scheme (forward Euler), compare it against the analytical solution, and compute a specified error metric. The language is precise and objective. All parameters are physically plausible and internally consistent. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the linear Maxwell constitutive equation for the shear stress $\\tau$ under a startup flow condition.\n\n**1. Governing Equation and Analytical Solution**\n\nThe governing equation for the shear stress component $\\tau(t) \\equiv \\tau_{xy}(t)$ in a linear Maxwell fluid under a time-dependent shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ is given as a first-order linear ODE:\n$$\n\\tau(t) + \\lambda \\frac{d\\tau(t)}{dt} = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the relaxation time and $\\eta$ is the zero-shear viscosity.\n\nThe physical scenario is a startup of simple shear flow, where the fluid is at rest for $t0$ and a constant shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma} = U/H$ is applied for all $t \\geq 0$. The initial condition is that the fluid is stress-free, so $\\tau(0) = 0$. For $t  0$, the ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\lambda \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} + \\tau = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nThis is a standard non-homogeneous first-order linear ODE. The solution consists of a homogeneous part and a particular (steady-state) solution. The steady-state solution, achieved as $t \\to \\infty$, is found by setting the time derivative to zero:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\infty} = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\lambda \\frac{d\\tau_h}{dt} + \\tau_h = 0$, which has the solution $\\tau_h(t) = C e^{-t/\\lambda}$ for some constant $C$. The general solution is the sum of the steady-state and homogeneous solutions:\n$$\n\\tau(t) = \\tau_{\\infty} + C e^{-t/\\lambda}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ is determined by the initial condition $\\tau(0)=0$:\n$$\n\\tau(0) = 0 = \\tau_{\\infty} + C e^0 \\implies C = -\\tau_{\\infty}\n$$\nSubstituting $C$ back into the general solution gives the analytical stress-growth function:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{analytic}}(t) = \\tau_{\\infty} (1 - e^{-t/\\lambda}) = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma} (1 - e^{-t/\\lambda})\n$$\nThis equation provides the exact value of the shear stress at any time $t \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Numerical Discretization and Stability**\n\nThe problem requires a forward Euler explicit time-stepping scheme. We first rearrange the governing ODE to isolate the time derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} (\\eta \\dot{\\gamma} - \\tau)\n$$\nDiscretizing this equation using a forward difference for the time derivative, $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} \\approx \\frac{\\tau^{n+1} - \\tau^n}{\\Delta t}$, where $\\tau^n = \\tau(t_n)$ and $t_n = n \\Delta t$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau^{n+1} - \\tau^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} (\\eta \\dot{\\gamma} - \\tau^n)\n$$\nSolving for the stress at the next time step, $\\tau^{n+1}$, yields the iterative formula:\n$$\n\\tau^{n+1} = \\tau^n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda} (\\eta \\dot{\\gamma} - \\tau^n) = \\tau^n \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda}\\right) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda} \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nThis formula allows us to compute the stress at time $t_{n+1}$ based on its value at time $t_n$. Starting with $\\tau^0 = 0$, we can march forward in time up to $T_{\\text{end}}$.\n\nThe stability of this explicit scheme depends on the amplification factor of the $\\tau^n$ term, which is $(1 - \\Delta t/\\lambda)$. For a stable solution, the magnitude of this factor must be less than or equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\left|1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda}\\right| \\le 1 \\implies -1 \\le 1 - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\lambda} \\le 1\n$$\nThis inequality yields the stability criterion $\\Delta t \\le 2\\lambda$. If $\\Delta t  2\\lambda$, the numerical solution will exhibit unphysical oscillations that grow exponentially, leading to instability. The test cases are designed to probe this limit: Cases $1$, $2$, and $4$ are stable ($\\Delta t/\\lambda  2$), while Case $3$ is unstable ($\\Delta t/\\lambda = 2.1  2$).\n\n**3. Spatial Considerations**\n\nThe problem specifies a one-dimensional mesh of $N$ nodes across the gap $[0,H]$. However, it also states that the kinematics impose a *uniform* simple shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}=U/H$ across the entire gap for all $t  0$. Since the governing ODE for $\\tau$ depends only on $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ and not on the spatial coordinate $y$, the ODE is identical at every point in the domain. Given a uniform initial condition $\\tau(y,0)=0$, the stress evolution $\\tau(y,t)$ must also be uniform in space, i.e., $\\tau(y,t) = \\tau(t)$.\n\nConsequently, the simulation is effectively zero-dimensional in space; we only need to solve a single ODE in time. The domain-averaged discrete stress $\\overline{\\tau}(t_n)$ is simply the stress value $\\tau^n$ computed at any single point. The number of nodes $N$ is therefore an extraneous parameter for this specific problem formulation, as the solution is identical at all nodes.\n\n**4. Error Metric Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to compute the normalized root-mean-square (RMS) deviation, $E$. The computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For a given test case, calculate the constant parameters: $\\dot{\\gamma} = U/H$ and $\\tau_{\\infty} = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}$.\n2. Determine the number of time steps $M = T_{\\text{end}}/\\Delta t$ and create an array of time points $t_n = n \\Delta t$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, M$.\n3. Compute the analytical solution $\\tau_{\\text{analytic}}(t_n)$ for all time points.\n4. Compute the numerical solution $\\tau^n$ for all time points using the forward Euler iteration, starting from $\\tau^0=0$.\n5. Calculate the sum of squared differences: $S = \\sum_{n=0}^{M} (\\tau^n - \\tau_{\\text{analytic}}(t_n))^2$.\n6. Compute the final error metric $E$ as per the formula:\n$$\nE = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{S}{M+1}}}{\\tau_{\\infty}}\n$$\nThis procedure is repeated for each of the four test cases. For the unstable case, the numerical values for $\\tau^n$ will grow very large, and the resulting error $E$ is expected to be extremely large or reported as infinity (`inf`), which is the correct outcome reflecting the breakdown of the numerical method.",
