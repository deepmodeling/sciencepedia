            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional massive tracer of mass $m$ immersed in a complex fluid at thermodynamic temperature $T$. The tracer’s momentum $p$ evolves under linear Stokes drag with coefficient $\\gamma$ (units of inverse time), along with thermal fluctuations from the fluid. You are tasked with designing a discrete-time integrator for the momentum over a time step $\\Delta t$ that respects the equilibrium Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at temperature $T$.\n\nAssume the time-discrete update for $p$ over one step is of the autoregressive form\n$$\np_{n+1} = a\\, p_n + \\eta_n,\n$$\nwhere $a$ is a deterministic coefficient determined only by the linear drag, and $\\eta_n$ is a zero-mean Gaussian random variable that models the net thermal impulse from the fluid over the interval $\\Delta t$. Assume that $\\eta_n$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across steps and independent of $p_n$.\n\nStarting only from Newton’s second law, linear drag, and the requirement of equilibrium with the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, proceed as follows:\n- Determine $a$ from the exact solution of the linear deterministic dynamics for $p$ under drag alone over a time step $\\Delta t$.\n- Impose that the stationary distribution of $p_n$ under the above Markov update is Maxwell–Boltzmann at temperature $T$, which implies $\\langle p_n^2 \\rangle = m k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard problem in statistical mechanics and computational physics concerning the discretization of a Langevin equation. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the variance of the thermal impulse, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\eta_n)$, for a discrete-time integrator of a particle's momentum. The integrator must preserve the equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We will follow the specified steps.\n\nFirst, we determine the deterministic coefficient $a$ in the update rule $p_{n+1} = a\\, p_n + \\eta_n$. This coefficient is derived from the dynamics under linear drag alone. The problem states a linear Stokes drag with a coefficient $\\gamma$ having units of inverse time. This implies the drag force is proportional to momentum, $F_{drag} = -\\gamma p$. Newton's second law for the momentum $p$ under this drag force is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp(t)}{dt} = -\\gamma p(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it over a time interval of duration $\\Delta t$, from an initial time $t_n$ where the momentum is $p(t_n) = p_n$, to a final time $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$. The solution is found by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\int_{p_n}^{p(t_{n+1})} \\frac{dp}{p} = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} -\\gamma dt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{p(t_{n+1})}{p_n}\\right) = -\\gamma (t_{n+1} - t_n) = -\\gamma \\Delta t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the exact solution for the deterministic evolution of momentum:\n$$\np(t_{n+1}) = p_n \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta t)\n$$\nBy comparing this result to the deterministic part of the discrete update rule, $p_{n+1} = a p_n$, we identify the coefficient $a$:\n$$\na = \\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta t)\n$$\n\nNext, we impose the condition that the stationary distribution of the momentum under the full stochastic update rule is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The update rule is:\n$$\np_{n+1} = a p_n + \\eta_n\n$$\nWe compute the second moment of the momentum at step $n+1$:\n$$\n\\langle p_{n+1}^2 \\rangle = \\langle (a p_n + \\eta_n)^2 \\rangle = \\langle a^2 p_n^2 + 2a p_n \\eta_n + \\eta_n^2 \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n$$\n\\langle p_{n+1}^2 \\rangle = a^2 \\langle p_n^2 \\rangle + 2a \\langle p_n \\eta_n \\rangle + \\langle \\eta_n^2 \\rangle\n$$\nThe problem states that the thermal impulse $\\eta_n$ is independent of the momentum $p_n$. Therefore, the covariance term is $\\langle p_n \\eta_n \\rangle = \\langle p_n \\rangle \\langle \\eta_n \\rangle$. The problem also specifies that $\\eta_n$ is a zero-mean random variable, so $\\langle \\eta_n \\rangle = 0$. Consequently, $\\langle p_n \\eta_n \\rangle = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\langle p_{n+1}^2 \\rangle = a^2 \\langle p_n^2 \\rangle + \\langle \\eta_n^2 \\rangle\n$$\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, the system is in a stationary state, which means the statistical properties of the momentum are constant over time. Thus, the mean squared momentum is time-invariant: $\\langle p_{n+1}^2 \\rangle = \\langle p_n^2 \\rangle \\equiv \\langle p^2 \\rangle_{eq}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\langle p^2 \\rangle_{eq} = a^2 \\langle p^2 \\rangle_{eq} + \\langle \\eta_n^2 \\rangle\n$$\nWe can now solve for $\\langle \\eta_n^2 \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\eta_n^2 \\rangle = (1 - a^2) \\langle p^2 \\rangle_{eq}\n$$\nThe variance of $\\eta_n$ is defined as $\\mathrm{Var}(\\eta_n) = \\langle \\eta_n^2 \\rangle - (\\langle \\eta_n \\rangle)^2$. Since $\\langle \\eta_n \\rangle = 0$, the variance is simply $\\mathrm{Var}(\\eta_n) = \\langle \\eta_n^2 \\rangle$.\nThe problem requires that the stationary distribution is Maxwell-Boltzmann, which for a one-dimensional particle of mass $m$ at temperature $T$ implies that the mean squared momentum is $\\langle p^2 \\rangle_{eq} = m k_B T$, a result of the equipartition theorem. Substituting this and the expression for $a$ into our equation for the variance, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\eta_n) = (1 - (\\exp(-\\gamma \\Delta t))^2) (m k_B T) = m k_B T (1 - \\exp(-2 \\gamma \\Delta t))\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the variance of the thermal impulse.\n\nFinally, we analyze the small time step limit ($\\Delta t \\to 0$) to relate this result to the continuous-time fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We use the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function for small arguments, $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$ for $x \\ll 1$. Let $x = -2 \\gamma \\Delta t$.\n$$\n\\exp(-2 \\gamma \\Delta t) \\approx 1 - 2 \\gamma \\Delta t\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the variance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\eta_n) \\approx m k_B T (1 - (1 - 2 \\gamma \\Delta t)) = m k_B T (2 \\gamma \\Delta t) = 2 m \\gamma k_B T \\Delta t\n$$\nIn the continuous formulation of the Langevin equation, $\\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\gamma p + F_{fluct}(t)$, the random force $F_{fluct}(t)$ is a white noise term whose strength is determined by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem: $\\langle F_{fluct}(t) F_{fluct}(t') \\rangle = 2 \\zeta k_B T \\delta(t-t')$, where $\\zeta$ is the friction coefficient. From the equation of motion, we identify $\\gamma = \\zeta/m$. The discrete thermal impulse $\\eta_n$ corresponds to the integral of the random force over the time step, $\\eta_n = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} F_{fluct}(t') dt'$. Its variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\eta_n) = \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\int_{t_n}^{t_{n+1}} \\langle F_{fluct}(t') F_{fluct}(t'') \\rangle dt' dt'' = 2 \\zeta k_B T \\Delta t = 2 (m\\gamma) k_B T \\Delta t$. Our asymptotic result matches this continuum limit, confirming the consistency of our derived variance. The expression $2 m \\gamma k_B T \\Delta t$ is indeed proportional to $2 \\gamma k_B T \\Delta t$, with the proportionality constant being the mass $m$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the reconstruction of the full complex susceptibility $\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$ of a trapped probe in a fluid from its thermal position fluctuations, quantified by the power spectral density $S_{xx}(\\omega)$. This task hinges on two fundamental principles of statistical physics: the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) and the causality principle, which manifests through the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relations. The solution involves three main stages: (1) calculating the ground-truth model and synthesizing the \"measured\" fluctuation spectrum, (2) applying the FDT and KK relations to reconstruct the real part of the susceptibility from the synthetic spectrum, and (3) quantifying the accuracy of the reconstruction.\n\n### Step 1: Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Susceptibility\n\nThe Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem establishes a direct relationship between the thermal fluctuations of a system at equilibrium and its dissipative response to an external perturbation. For a one-dimensional system like the probe's position $x$, the theorem relates the power spectral density of position fluctuations, $S_{xx}(\\omega)$, to the imaginary (dissipative) part of the mechanical susceptibility, $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$. The spectral form of the theorem for a classical system at temperature $T$ is:\n$$\nS_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{\\omega} \\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. This equation forms the basis for the first part of the task. Given $S_{xx}(\\omega)$ and $T$, we can compute the dissipative component of the susceptibility:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega S_{xx}(\\omega)}{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\n$$\nAt $\\omega = 0$, a static force produces no dissipation, so $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(0) = 0$. This is consistent with the formula, as the $\\omega$ term in the numerator ensures the result is zero at zero frequency. For $\\omega  0$, this provides a direct algebraic way to find $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$ from the fluctuation spectrum.\n\n### Step 2: Causality and the Kramers-Kronig Relations\n\nThe principle of causality dictates that a system's response cannot precede the force that causes it. This physical constraint imposes a mathematical structure on the complex susceptibility $\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$. Specifically, $\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$ must be an analytic function in the upper half of the complex frequency plane. A consequence of this analyticity is that the real and imaginary parts of $\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$ are not independent but are related to each other through a pair of integral transforms known as the Kramers-Kronig relations.\n\nTo reconstruct the real (reactive) part of the susceptibility, $\\operatorname{Re}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$, from its imaginary part, we use the following KK relation:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\mathcal{P} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega')}{\\omega' - \\omega} d\\omega'\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}$ denotes the Cauchy principal value of the integral. Since the physical response function $x(t)$ is real-valued, its Fourier transform $\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$ has the symmetry property $\\chi_{xx}(-\\omega) = \\chi_{xx}^*(\\omega)$, which means $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$ is an odd function of $\\omega$. Using this property, the integral can be simplified to run only over positive frequencies:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\mathcal{P} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\omega' \\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega')}{\\omega'^2 - \\omega^2} d\\omega'\n$$\nThis is the integral that must be implemented numerically.\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Implementation\n\nThe problem provides data on a finite, uniform grid $\\omega_i \\in [0, \\omega_{\\max}]$ with spacing $\\Delta\\omega$. The KK integral is approximated by a sum. The principal value is handled by omitting the singular term where the denominator is zero.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re}\\chi_{xx}^{\\text{recon}}(\\omega_k) \\approx \\frac{2 \\Delta\\omega}{\\pi} \\sum_{j, j \\neq k} \\frac{\\omega_j \\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega_j)}{\\omega_j^2 - \\omega_k^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_k$ is the frequency at which we reconstruct the real part and the sum runs over the grid points $\\omega_j$. The integral truncation at $\\omega_{\\max}$ is an inherent approximation in this procedure.\n\n### Step 4: Ground-Truth Models and Data Synthesis\n\nTo validate the reconstruction, we first need a ground truth. The problem provides the physical model for the susceptibility:\n$$\n\\chi_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{k - i\\omega\\zeta^*(\\omega)}\n$$\nThe complex friction $\\zeta^*(\\omega)$ is modeled via the fluid's complex shear modulus $G^*(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\zeta^*(\\omega) = 6\\pi a \\eta^*(\\omega) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\eta^*(\\omega) = \\frac{G^*(\\omega)}{i\\omega}\n$$\nSubstituting these yields a direct relation between $\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$ and $G^*(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\chi_{xx}^{\\text{true}}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{k - 6\\pi a G^*(\\omega)}\n$$\nThe specific models for $G^*(\\omega)$ are:\n1.  **Newtonian Fluid**: $G^*(\\omega) = i\\omega\\eta$. The viscosity $\\eta$ is constant.\n2.  **Maxwell Fluid**: $G^*(\\omega) = G_0 \\frac{i\\omega\\tau}{1+i\\omega\\tau}$. This model has a frequency-dependent viscosity, exhibiting both elastic ($G_0$) and viscous ($\\tau$) character.\n\nFor each test case, we compute the ground-truth $\\chi_{xx}^{\\text{true}}(\\omega)$ over the specified frequency grid. From this, we extract $\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}^{\\text{true}}(\\omega)$ and synthesize the input power spectrum $S_{xx}(\\omega)$ using the FDT. Care must be taken at $\\omega=0$, where the FDT expression is an indeterminate $0/0$ form. The correct value is found by taking the limit:\n$$\nS_{xx}(0) = 2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{\\operatorname{Im}\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)}{\\omega}\n$$\nFor a Newtonian fluid with friction $\\zeta=6\\pi a\\eta$, this limit gives $S_{xx}(0) = 2k_BT\\zeta/k^2$. For the Maxwell model, the zero-shear friction is $\\zeta_0 = 6\\pi a G_0 \\tau$, yielding $S_{xx}(0) = 2k_BT\\zeta_0/k^2$.\n\n### Step 5: Error Calculation\n\nAfter reconstructing $\\operatorname{Re}\\chi_{xx}^{\\text{recon}}(\\omega)$ using the KK integral, its accuracy is assessed against the ground-truth $\\operatorname{Re}\\chi_{xx}^{\\text{true}}(\\omega)$ using the provided relative root-mean-square error metric $\\varepsilon$, computed over the positive-frequency points of the grid.\n\nThe complete procedure—synthesis, reconstruction, and validation—is implemented for each of the three test cases specified. The resulting reconstruction error $\\varepsilon$ for each case is then reported.",
