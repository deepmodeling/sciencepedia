            "problem": "Consider an isothermal, isobaric, ideal-gas reactor containing a solid catalyst with a single type of adsorption site. A simple reaction mechanism converts a gas-phase reactant into a gas-phase product via a single surface intermediate. The mechanism consists of two elementary steps: (i) Langmuir adsorption of the reactant, and (ii) an irreversible unimolecular surface reaction that is the rate-determining step (RDS).

Express the final answer as a single row matrix $(x_{k_r}, x_{K_A})$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a classic Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model, a cornerstone of heterogeneous catalysis theory. The mechanism, assumptions, and definitions are standard in chemical engineering and physical chemistry textbooks. It is free of any pseudoscience or controversial claims.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear mechanism and a complete set of standard assumptions (quasi-equilibrium, RDS) that allow for a unique derivation of the rate law and the DRCs. The objective is clearly stated, and a definite analytical solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, unambiguous scientific language. All terms are well-defined within the context of chemical kinetics.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary information and definitions required for the derivation are provided. There are no contradictions in the setup.\n- **Realism**: The model is a simplification, but it is a scientifically valid and widely used approximation for many real catalytic systems.\n- **Structure**: The problem is logically structured, first asking for the derivation of a rate law, and then for the derivation of sensitivity metrics based on that rate law.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard, well-posed problem in chemical kinetics that is scientifically sound and internally consistent. The derivation of the solution can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Rate Law\nThe analysis begins with the provided two-step mechanism. Let $\\theta_{A*}$ be the fraction of catalyst sites occupied by species $A$, and $\\theta_*$ be the fraction of vacant sites.\n\nStep (i) is the adsorption of $A$: $A(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$. This step is assumed to be quasi-equilibrated. This implies that the forward and reverse rates of this step are effectively equal and much faster than the rate of step (ii). The equilibrium relationship for this step is given by:\n$$K_A = \\frac{\\theta_{A*}}{p_A \\theta_*}$$\nwhere $K_A$ is the adsorption equilibrium constant. This equation can be rearranged to express the coverage of $A*$ in terms of the vacant site coverage:\n$$\\theta_{A*} = K_A p_A \\theta_*$$\n\nThe catalyst surface has a finite number of sites. The site balance equation states that the sum of the fractions of all types of sites must equal unity. In this mechanism, sites are either vacant ($*$) or occupied by $A$ ($A*$). Therefore:\n$$\\theta_* + \\theta_{A*} = 1$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the two unknown coverages, $\\theta_*$ and $\\theta_{A*}$. Substituting the first equation into the second yields:\n$$\\theta_* + (K_A p_A \\theta_*) = 1$$\nFactoring out $\\theta_*$:\n$$\\theta_*(1 + K_A p_A) = 1$$\nSolving for the vacant site coverage, $\\theta_*$:\n$$\\theta_* = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\nSubstituting this expression back into the equation for $\\theta_{A*}$ gives the coverage of the surface intermediate $A*$:\n$$\\theta_{A*} = K_A p_A \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A} \\right) = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\nThis expression for $\\theta_{A*}$ is the Langmuir isotherm for single-site dissociative adsorption.\n\nThe overall rate of the reaction, $r$, is determined by the rate of the rate-determining step (RDS), which is step (ii): $A* \\rightarrow P(\\mathrm{g}) + *$. The rate of this elementary step is proportional to the concentration (or coverage) of the reactant species, $A*$. Thus:\n$$r = k_r \\theta_{A*}$$\nwhere $k_r$ is the rate constant for the surface reaction. Substituting the derived expression for $\\theta_{A*}$ into this rate equation gives the overall rate law:\n$$r = k_r \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\n\n### Derivation of the Degrees of Rate Control (DRC)\nCampbell's Degree of Rate Control for a parameter $z$ is defined as $x_z = \\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial \\ln z}$. The external conditions, such as $p_A$, are held constant during the differentiation.\n\nFirst, we take the natural logarithm of the rate expression:\n$$\\ln r = \\ln \\left( k_r \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} \\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this can be expanded as:\n$$\\ln r = \\ln(k_r) + \\ln(K_A) + \\ln(p_A) - \\ln(1 + K_A p_A)$$\n\nNow, we can compute the DRC for each parameter.\n\n**DRC with respect to $k_r$ ($x_{k_r}$):**\nThe DRC for $k_r$ is found by differentiating $\\ln r$ with respect to $\\ln k_r$, holding $K_A$ and $p_A$ constant.\n$$x_{k_r} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln r)}{\\partial (\\ln k_r)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln k_r)} \\left[ \\ln(k_r) + \\ln(K_A) + \\ln(p_A) - \\ln(1 + K_A p_A) \\right]$$\nOnly the first term, $\\ln(k_r)$, is a function of $k_r$. The other terms are constant with respect to this differentiation.\n$$x_{k_r} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln k_r)}{\\partial (\\ln k_r)} = 1$$\nThis result is expected: because the overall rate $r$ is directly proportional to $k_r$, the logarithmic sensitivity is unity.\n\n**DRC with respect to $K_A$ ($x_{K_A}$):**\nThe DRC for $K_A$ is found by differentiating $\\ln r$ with respect to $\\ln K_A$, holding $k_r$ and $p_A$ constant.\n$$x_{K_A} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln r)}{\\partial (\\ln K_A)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln K_A)} \\left[ \\ln(k_r) + \\ln(K_A) + \\ln(p_A) - \\ln(1 + K_A p_A) \\right]$$\nThe terms $\\ln(k_r)$ and $\\ln(p_A)$ are constant. The differentiation becomes:\n$$x_{K_A} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln K_A)}{\\partial (\\ln K_A)} - \\frac{\\partial (\\ln(1 + K_A p_A))}{\\partial (\\ln K_A)}$$\nThe first term is $1$. For the second term, we use the chain rule: $\\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial v} = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial v}$. Let $u = \\ln K_A$, so $K_A = \\exp(u)$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial (\\ln(1 + K_A p_A))}{\\partial (\\ln K_A)} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln(1 + p_A \\exp(u)))}{\\partial u} = \\frac{1}{1 + p_A \\exp(u)} \\cdot (p_A \\exp(u)) = \\frac{p_A K_A}{1 + p_A K_A}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $x_{K_A}$:\n$$x_{K_A} = 1 - \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\nThis can be simplified by finding a common denominator:\n$$x_{K_A} = \\frac{(1 + K_A p_A) - K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A}$$\nNotably, this expression for $x_{K_A}$ is equal to the vacant site fraction, $\\theta_*$. This means that the sensitivity of the rate to changes in the adsorption strength decreases as the surface becomes saturated with the reactant.\n\nThe derived DRCs are $x_{k_r} = 1$ and $x_{K_A} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A}$. The problem requests the answer as a single row matrix $(x_{k_r}, x_{K_A})$.",

From the $A*$ balance,\n$$\n\\theta_A = \\frac{(k_1 p_A)\\theta_*}{k_2(\\varphi) + k_3(\\varphi)}.\n$$\nFrom the $B*$ balance,\n$$\n\\theta_B = \\frac{k_3(\\varphi)}{k_4(\\varphi)}\\theta_A.\n$$\nThe site balance gives\n$$\n\\theta_* = 1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B = 1 - \\theta_A\\left[1 + \\frac{k_3(\\varphi)}{k_4(\\varphi)}\\right].\n$$\nSubstituting $\\theta_A$ in terms of $\\theta_*$,\n$$\n\\theta_* = 1 - \\frac{(k_1 p_A)\\theta_*}{k_2(\\varphi) + k_3(\\varphi)}\\left[1 + \\frac{k_3(\\varphi)}{k_4(\\varphi)}\\right].\n$$\nDefine\n$$\nF(\\varphi) = \\frac{k_1 p_A}{k_2(\\varphi) + k_3(\\varphi)}\\left[1 + \\frac{k_3(\\varphi)}{k_4(\\varphi)}\\right].\n$$\nThen the site balance becomes\n$$\n\\theta_*\\big(1 + F(\\varphi)\\big) = 1, \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\theta_* = \\frac{1}{1 + F(\\varphi)}.\n$$\nThe turnover frequency follows from $r(\\varphi) = k_3(\\varphi)\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_A$ in terms of $\\theta_*$:\n$$\nr(\\varphi) = k_3(\\varphi)\\frac{(k_1 p_A)\\theta_*}{k_2(\\varphi) + k_3(\\varphi)} = \\frac{k_3(\\varphi)(k_1 p_A)}{k_2(\\varphi) + k_3(\\varphi)}\\frac{1}{1 + F(\\varphi)}.\n$$\nThis expression contains only the four rate constants and the descriptor-controlled barriers via their Arrhenius relations. The constants are defined in electronvolts for activation energies and in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for pre-exponentials in a way that yields $r(\\varphi)$ in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we quantify Campbell’s Degree of Rate Control (DRC) for each step $i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$. Campbell’s Degree of Rate Control (DRC) is the dimensionless sensitivity of the overall steady-state rate to the rate constant of a specific step under steady-state constraints, defined as the logarithmic derivative of the turnover frequency with respect to the logarithm of the rate constant for that step while holding all other parameters fixed. To evaluate this numerically without invoking any shortcut formulas, we proceed by small symmetric multiplicative perturbations. For a given $\\varphi$, define the vector of rate constants $\\mathbf{k}(\\varphi) = \\big[k_1 p_A,\\, k_2(\\varphi),\\, k_3(\\varphi),\\, k_4(\\varphi)\\big]$. For each index $i$, construct perturbed vectors $\\mathbf{k}^{(+)}$ and $\\mathbf{k}^{(-)}$ by multiplying only the $i$-th component by $1 + \\delta$ and $1 - \\delta$, respectively, with $\\delta = 10^{-4}$. Compute the corresponding turnover frequencies $r^{(+)}$ and $r^{(-)}$ at fixed $\\varphi$ by inserting the perturbed rate constants into the steady-state expression for $r(\\varphi)$. The DRC for step $i$ is then approximated by the symmetric finite-difference estimate of the logarithmic derivative:\n$$\nX_{\\mathrm{RC},i}(\\varphi) \\approx \\frac{\\ln r^{(+)} - \\ln r^{(-)}}{\\ln\\big(k_i(1+\\delta)\\big) - \\ln\\big(k_i(1-\\delta)\\big)}.\n$$\nThis is consistent with the definition of a logarithmic sensitivity and yields a dimensionless DRC value for each step. The controlling barrier for a given $\\varphi$ is identified as the step with the largest positive $X_{\\mathrm{RC},i}(\\varphi)$.\n\nTo construct the volcano, evaluate $r(\\varphi)$ across the test suite $[-1.8, -1.4, -1.0, -0.6, -0.2]$. For strongly negative $\\varphi$ (strong binding), $|\\varphi|$ and $|E_B(\\varphi)|$ are large, which makes $k_2(\\varphi)$ and $k_4(\\varphi)$ small and increases surface coverage, typically leading to a small $r(\\varphi)$ limited by desorption of the product. For weakly negative $\\varphi$ (weak binding), $E_{\\mathrm{rxn}}(\\varphi)$ becomes large, which makes $k_3(\\varphi)$ small, reducing the surface reaction rate and resulting again in a small $r(\\varphi)$. Between these regimes, there is an intermediate $\\varphi$ where the trade-off between too-strong and too-weak binding optimizes $r(\\varphi)$, forming the apex of the volcano.\n\nBy computing $X_{\\mathrm{RC},i}(\\varphi)$ numerically for each step and each descriptor value, one typically observes that for the left-hand slope (strong binding), the largest positive DRC corresponds to product desorption ($i=3$), indicating that desorption is most rate-controlling. For the right-hand slope (weak binding), the largest positive DRC corresponds to the surface reaction ($i=2$), indicating that the chemical transformation is most rate-controlling. Near the apex, DRC values are more balanced and may show mixed control among steps. The program therefore reports, for each $\\varphi$ in the test suite, the pair $[r(\\varphi), i_{\\max}]$ where $i_{\\max}$ is the index of the step with the largest positive DRC, thus quantitatively explaining the shift in controlling barriers from the left to the right slope of the volcano. The final output is a single line consisting of a list of these per-case results, with $r(\\varphi)$ given in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ rounded to six decimal places as required.",
