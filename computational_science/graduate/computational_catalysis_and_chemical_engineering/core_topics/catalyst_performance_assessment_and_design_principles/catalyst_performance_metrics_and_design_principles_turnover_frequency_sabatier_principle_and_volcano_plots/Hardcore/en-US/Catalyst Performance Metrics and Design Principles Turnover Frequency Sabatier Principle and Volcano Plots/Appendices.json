There are no subjective or opinion-based clauses.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is hereby deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe turnover frequency (TOF) is a normalized rate that expresses the intrinsic activity of a catalytic site. It is defined as the rate of reaction (moles of product formed per unit time) per mole of active catalytic sites. This provides a basis for comparing the activity of different catalysts, independent of the amount of catalyst used or its dispersion.\n\nGiven the total observed production rate $r_{\\text{obs}}$ (in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) and the total number of moles of active sites $N_{\\text{act}}$ (in units of $\\mathrm{mol}$), the TOF is derived from first principles as their ratio:\n$$\n\\text{TOF} = \\frac{r_{\\text{obs}}}{N_{\\text{act}}}\n$$\nThe units of TOF are $(\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})/\\mathrm{mol} = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This experimentally determined TOF is the macroscopic manifestation of the underlying microscopic events. The problem states that the per-site rate is $r_{\\text{site}} = k_{2}\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$. This per-site rate is, by definition, the TOF. Thus, our derived expression allows for the experimental measurement of the quantity described by the microkinetic model. To calculate the TOF, we need experimental values for $r_{\\text{obs}}$ and $N_{\\text{act}}$.\n\nThe measurement strategy for determining the active site density, $S_{\\mathrm{site}}$, and the total number of active sites, $N_{\\text{act}}$, involves the following steps:\n1.  A known mass of the catalyst, $m_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, is subjected to a carbon monoxide ($CO$) chemisorption experiment. This technique selectively measures the amount of $CO$ that forms a chemical bond with the surface active sites (e.g., metal atoms).\n2.  The experiment yields the specific uptake of $CO$, denoted as $q_{\\mathrm{CO}}$, typically in units of moles of $CO$ per gram of catalyst ($\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$).\n3.  A stoichiometric assumption is required to relate the moles of adsorbed $CO$ to the moles of active sites. The problem specifies a stoichiometry of $1:1$, meaning one $CO$ molecule adsorbs onto exactly one active site. Therefore, the specific number of moles of active sites is numerically equal to $q_{\\mathrm{CO}}$.\n4.  The total number of moles of active sites in the reactor, $N_{\\text{act}}$, is then calculated by multiplying the specific site count by the mass of the catalyst charged:\n    $$\n    N_{\\text{act}} = q_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\times m_{\\mathrm{cat}}\n    $$\n5.  To determine the active-site density, $S_{\\mathrm{site}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{act}}}{A_{\\mathrm{cat}}}$, one also needs the total accessible catalytic surface area, $A_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. This is obtained from the given metal-specific surface area, $A_{\\mathrm{M}}$, and the catalyst mass: $A_{\\mathrm{cat}} = A_{\\mathrm{M}} \\times m_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. The site density is then $S_{\\mathrm{site}} = \\frac{q_{\\mathrm{CO}}}{A_{\\mathrm{M}}}$.\n\nThe dependence of the rate constant $k_2$ on binding strength is central to Sabatier's principle. The overall rate, $\\text{TOF} = k_{2}\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$, depends on two factors that are both functions of the reactant's binding strength to the catalyst surface.\n- The surface coverage, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$, increases with stronger binding. If binding is too weak, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is very low, and the rate is limited by the low concentration of adsorbed reactant.\n- The rate constant for the surface reaction, $k_2$, typically decreases with stronger binding. According to Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relations, a more stable adsorbed state (stronger binding) often corresponds to a higher activation energy barrier for its subsequent transformation, thus a smaller $k_2$. If binding is too strong, the surface becomes saturated ($\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx 1$), but the adsorbed species are too stable to react, making $k_2$ very small. The rate is then limited by the slow surface reaction.\n\nSabatier's principle states that for optimal catalytic activity, the binding strength of intermediates must be intermediate: strong enough to ensure appreciable surface coverage but weak enough to allow for facile product formation and release. This trade-off, when plotting catalytic activity (TOF) against a descriptor of binding strength (e.g., adsorption energy), results in a characteristic \"volcano plot,\" where the peak activity corresponds to the optimal binding strength.\n\nNow, we compute the TOF for the provided dataset.\nFirst, we calculate the total number of moles of active sites, $N_{\\text{act}}$.\nThe given specific uptake of carbon monoxide is $q_{\\mathrm{CO}} = 120\\,\\mu\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$. We convert this to $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}$:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{CO}} = 120 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}\n$$\nThe mass of the catalyst is $m_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\nUsing the $1:1$ stoichiometric assumption, the total moles of active sites are:\n$$\nN_{\\text{act}} = q_{\\mathrm{CO}} \\times m_{\\mathrm{cat}} = (1.20 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{g}^{-1}) \\times (0.100\\,\\mathrm{g}) = 1.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\n$$\nThe observed product formation rate is given as $r_{\\text{obs}} = 4.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nWe can now calculate the TOF:\n$$\n\\text{TOF} = \\frac{r_{\\text{obs}}}{N_{\\text{act}}} = \\frac{4.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mol}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{TOF} = \\frac{4.80}{1.20} \\times 10^{-6 - (-5)}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 4.00 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{TOF} = 0.400\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe result is given to three significant figures, consistent with the precision of the input data ($4.80 \\times 10^{-6}$, $1.20 \\times 10^{-4}$, and $0.100$). The metal-specific surface area, $A_{\\mathrm{M}}$, was not required for this final calculation but was relevant for the discussion of determining site density.",

The derivation must proceed from first principles as laid out in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we will derive the expression for the steady-state turnover frequency, $r$. The turnover frequency is defined as the rate of formation of product $P(g)$ per site. This corresponds to elementary step $3$: $P^* \\rightarrow P(g) + *$. The rate of this step, using mass-action kinetics, is given by:\n$$r = r_3 = k_3 \\theta_P$$\nwhere $k_3$ is the rate constant for step $3$ and $\\theta_P$ is the fractional surface coverage of the intermediate $P^*$. To find an expression for $r$ in terms of the given parameters ($K_A$, $p_A$, $k_2$, $k_3$), we must express $\\theta_P$ in terms of these parameters.\n\nWe apply the steady-state approximation to the intermediate $P^*$. The rate of formation of $P^*$ is from step $2$, $r_2 = k_2 \\theta_A$. The rate of consumption of $P^*$ is from step $3$, $r_3 = k_3 \\theta_P$. At steady-state, the net rate of formation of $P^*$ is zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta_P}{dt} = r_2 - r_3 = k_2 \\theta_A - k_3 \\theta_P = 0$$\nThis yields a relationship between the coverages of the two intermediates:\n$$k_2 \\theta_A = k_3 \\theta_P \\quad \\implies \\quad \\theta_P = \\frac{k_2}{k_3} \\theta_A$$\nNext, we use the site balance equation and the quasi-equilibrium assumption for adsorption. The site balance is given as:\n$$\\theta_* + \\theta_A + \\theta_P = 1$$\nwhere $\\theta_*$, $\\theta_A$, and $\\theta_P$ are the fractional coverages of vacant sites, adsorbed reactant $A^*$, and adsorbed product $P^*$, respectively.\n\nThe quasi-equilibrium for adsorption of $A$ is given by:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_*$$\nWe can now express all coverages in terms of one variable, for instance $\\theta_*$.

This can be written as $X_i = k_i \\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial k_i}$.\nFirst, we express $\\ln r$:\n$$\\ln r = \\ln(k_2 k_3 K_A p_A) - \\ln(k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A)$$\n$$\\ln r = \\ln(k_2) + \\ln(k_3) + \\ln(K_A p_A) - \\ln(k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A)$$\nTo compute $X_2$, we differentiate $\\ln r$ with respect to $k_2$ and multiply by $k_2$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial k_2} = \\frac{1}{k_2} - \\frac{1}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_2}[k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A]$$\nThe derivative of the denominator term is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_2}[k_3 + k_2 K_A p_A + k_3 K_A p_A] = K_A p_A$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial k_2} = \\frac{1}{k_2} - \\frac{K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}$$\n$$X_2 = k_2 \\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial k_2} = k_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{k_2} - \\frac{K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{k_2 K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}$$\nCombining terms with a common denominator:\n$$X_2 = \\frac{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A - k_2 K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A} = \\frac{k_3 + k_2 K_A p_A + k_3 K_A p_A - k_2 K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}$$\n$$X_2 = \\frac{k_3 + k_3 K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A} = \\frac{k_3 (1 + K_A p_A)}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}$$\nTo compute $X_3$, we differentiate $\\ln r$ with respect to $k_3$ and multiply by $k_3$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial k_3} = \\frac{1}{k_3} - \\frac{1}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_3}[k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A]$$\nThe derivative of the denominator term is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_3}[k_3 + k_2 K_A p_A + k_3 K_A p_A] = 1 + K_A p_A$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial k_3} = \\frac{1}{k_3} - \\frac{1 + K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}$$\n$$X_3 = k_3 \\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial k_3} = k_3 \\left(\\frac{1}{k_3} - \\frac{1 + K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{k_3 (1 + K_A p_A)}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}$$\nThis is $1 - X_2$. Using the expression derived for $X_2$:\n$$X_3 = \\frac{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A - k_3 (1 + K_A p_A)}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}$$\n$$X_3 = \\frac{k_3 + k_2 K_A p_A + k_3 K_A p_A - k_3 - k_3 K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A} = \\frac{k_2 K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A}$$\nAs a check, we can verify that for the two irreversible steps, the DRCs sum to unity: $X_2 + X_3 = \\frac{k_3(1+K_A p_A)}{k_3 + (k_2+k_3)K_A p_A} + \\frac{k_2 K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2+k_3)K_A p_A} = \\frac{k_3 + k_3 K_A p_A + k_2 K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A} = 1$. This confirms the consistency of the results.\n\nFinally, we interpret the DRCs in the two limiting binding regimes.\nWeak Binding Limit ($K_A p_A \\ll 1$):\nIn this limit, the term $K_A p_A$ approaches zero.\n$$X_2 = \\frac{k_3 (1 + K_A p_A)}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A} \\to \\frac{k_3(1)}{k_3 + 0} = 1$$\n$$X_3 = \\frac{k_2 K_A p_A}{k_3 + (k_2 + k_3)K_A p_A} \\to \\frac{0}{k_3 + 0} = 0$$\nInterpretation: In the weak binding regime, the surface is mostly vacant ($\\theta_* \\approx 1$). The overall rate is limited by the availability of adsorbed reactant $A^*$. Since step $2$ ($A^* \\to P^*$) is the first step consuming $A^*$ after adsorption, its rate constant $k_2$ has complete control over the overall rate ($X_2 = 1$). Step $3$ is not rate-limiting ($X_3 = 0$) because the concentration of $P^*$ is very low, and it desorbs much faster than it is formed. This corresponds to the left side of a classic volcano plot, where the rate increases with stronger binding (increasing $K_A$). The reaction is limited by the surface concentration of the reactant intermediate.\n\nStrong Binding Limit ($K_A p_A \\gg 1$):\nIn this limit, we can divide the numerator and denominator of the DRC expressions by $K_A p_A$.\n$$X_2 = \\frac{k_3 (\\frac{1}{K_A p_A} + 1)}{\\frac{k_3}{K_A p_A} + (k_2 + k_3)} \\to \\frac{k_3(0+1)}{0 + k_2 + k_3} = \\frac{k_3}{k_2 + k_3}$$\n$$X_3 = \\frac{k_2}{\\frac{k_3}{K_A p_A} + (k_2 + k_3)} \\to \\frac{k_2}{0 + k_2 + k_3} = \\frac{k_2}{k_2 + k_3}$$\nInterpretation: In the strong binding regime, the surface is saturated with adsorbates ($\\theta_* \\approx 0$, and $\\theta_A + \\theta_P \\approx 1$). The availability of free sites becomes the limiting factor. The rate is no longer controlled by reactant adsorption but by the subsequent surface steps: the reaction of $A^*$ (step $2$) and the desorption of $P^*$ which regenerates a free site (step $3$). The rate control is now shared between these two steps, with their relative importance determined by the ratio of their rate constants. This situation corresponds to the right side of a volcano plot, where the rate decreases as binding becomes even stronger because the surface is 'poisoned' or blocked by strongly adsorbed species. Sabatier's principle states that there is an optimal binding energy for catalysis; these two limits illustrate the principle by showing that if binding is too weak or too strong, the rate is sub-optimal. The peak of the volcano represents the optimal balance where the rate-limiting step transitions from being related to surface coverage (left side) to being related to surface reaction/desorption rates (right side).",

Ideal-gas adsorption equilibria on a single site type under the Langmuir isotherm: $\\dfrac{\\theta_{X}}{\\theta_{*}} = K_{X} p_{X}$, where $X$ denotes the adsorbed species, $\\theta_{X}$ is the fractional coverage of $X$, $\\theta_{*}$ is the fractional coverage of vacant sites, $K_{X}$ is an adsorption equilibrium constant with units $\\mathrm{bar^{-1}}$, and $p_{X}$ is the partial pressure of species $X$ with units $\\mathrm{bar}$.\n4. Site balance on a uniform surface: $\\theta_{*} + \\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\theta_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1$, where $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are coverages of the adsorbed reactant and product, respectively.\n5. Adsorption equilibrium constants are related to adsorption free energies as $K_{X} = \\dfrac{1}{p_{0}} \\exp\\left(-\\dfrac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads},X}}{R T}\\right)$, where $p_{0}$ is the standard pressure with units $\\mathrm{bar}$, and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads},X} \\approx E_{X} - T \\Delta S_{X}$ comprises an adsorption energy $E_{X}$ with units $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ and an entropy change $\\Delta S_{X}$ with units $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n6. Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) scaling for the single-descriptor volcano: an activation energy that depends linearly on the reactant adsorption energy, $E_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\alpha E_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\beta$, and a product adsorption energy that also depends linearly on the reactant adsorption energy, $E_{\\mathrm{B}} = c_{1} E_{\\mathrm{A}} + c_{0}$, with $\\alpha$, $c_{1}$ dimensionless and $\\beta$, $c_{0}$ in $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nTo represent breaking of scaling relations via targeted dopants, consider an expanded design space where the transition-state energy and product adsorption energy can be independently shifted relative to the single-descriptor predictions. Model this by introducing bounded additive shifts $\\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ (both in $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$), resulting in $E_{\\mathrm{a}}' = \\alpha E_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\beta + \\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{B}}' = c_{1} E_{\\mathrm{A}} + c_{0} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$, where $\\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}} \\in [-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}, +\\Delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}]$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{B}} \\in [-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}, +\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}]$. The reactant adsorption energy $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$ remains the descriptor scanned over a fixed interval. The entropic contributions $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are assumed independent of dopant.\n\nFrom the above bases, derive from first principles the steady-state TOF as a function of $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{B}}$ (or $E_{\\mathrm{B}}'$), $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ (or $E_{\\mathrm{a}}'$), $T$, $p_{\\mathrm{A}}$, $p_{\\mathrm{B}}$, $\\nu$, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{A}}$, and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{B}}$. The derivation must logically combine the Arrhenius law, the adsorption equilibria, and the site balance to arrive at the TOF expression that depends on the design variables. Then, for each parameter set in the test suite, you must compute two quantities via numerical search over the specified design spaces:\n1. The maximum TOF attainable under the single-descriptor volcano assumption by scanning $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$ over its interval and using $E_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\alpha E_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\beta$ and $E_{\\mathrm{B}} = c_{1} E_{\\mathrm{A}} + c_{0}$.\n2. The maximum TOF attainable when scaling relations are broken by dopants by scanning $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$ over its interval and independently scanning $\\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}} \\in [-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}, +\\Delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}]$ and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{B}} \\in [-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}, +\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}]$ to use $E_{\\mathrm{a}}' = \\alpha E_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\beta + \\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{B}}' = c_{1} E_{\\mathrm{A}} + c_{0} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\nFor each parameter set, report the improvement factor defined as the ratio of the maximum TOF with broken scaling to the maximum TOF under the single-descriptor volcano. Express the improvement factor as a floating-point number rounded to six decimal places; as a pure number, it is unitless because it is a ratio of TOFs. The underlying TOFs must be consistently computed in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nUse the universal gas constant $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$. Convert all energies provided in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ into $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ before using them in exponentials or thermodynamic expressions. Use the standard pressure $p_{0} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n\nTest suite of parameter sets, each given as a tuple specifying $(T, p_{\\mathrm{A}}, p_{\\mathrm{B}}, \\nu, \\alpha, \\beta, c_{1}, c_{0}, \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{A}}, \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{B}}, E_{\\mathrm{A},\\min}, E_{\\mathrm{A},\\max}, N_{E}, \\Delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}, \\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}, N_{\\delta})$, where $T$ is in $\\mathrm{K}$, the pressures are in $\\mathrm{bar}$, $\\nu$ is in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $\\alpha$ and $c_{1}$ are dimensionless, $\\beta$ and $c_{0}$ are in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{A}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are in $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{A},\\min}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{A},\\max}$ are in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, $N_{E}$ is the number of evenly spaced points in the $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$ scan, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ and $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are the maximum absolute dopant-induced shifts in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, and $N_{\\delta}$ is the number of evenly spaced points for each dopant shift scan (the scan is symmetric about zero):\n1.

Derivation of the TOF Expression\n\nThe catalytic cycle is described by three elementary steps for the conversion of gaseous reactant $\\mathrm{A}$ to gaseous product $\\mathrm{B}$ on an active site $*$:\n1.  Reversible Adsorption of Reactant: $\\mathrm{A(g)} + * \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{A}^*$\n2.  Surface Reaction: $\\mathrm{A}^* \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}^*$\n3.  Reversible Desorption of Product: $\\mathrm{B}^* \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{B(g)} + *$\n\nWe assume the surface reaction (step 2) is the rate-determining step (RDS), and the adsorption/desorption steps (1 and 3) are in a state of quasi-equilibrium. The Turnover Frequency (TOF) is the rate of the RDS per active site.\n\nThe rate of the surface reaction is given by:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TOF} = k_{2} \\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}\n$$\nwhere $k_{2}$ is the forward rate constant for the surface reaction and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is the fractional surface coverage of the adsorbed reactant $\\mathrm{A}^*$.\n\nFrom Transition State Theory (TST), the rate constant $k_2$ is expressed as:\n$$\nk_{2} = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the activation energy of the surface reaction, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nTo find $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$, we apply the quasi-equilibrium assumption to steps 1 and 3 and the site balance equation.\nThe total number of sites is conserved. For fractional coverages:\n$$\n\\theta_{*} + \\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\theta_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1\n$$\nwhere $\\theta_{*}$, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$, and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are the coverages of vacant sites, adsorbed reactant, and adsorbed product, respectively.\n\nThe quasi-equilibrium for reactant adsorption is described by the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}}{\\theta_{*} p_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\implies \\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} = K_{\\mathrm{A}} p_{\\mathrm{A}} \\theta_{*}\n$$\nSimilarly, for product adsorption:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{B}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{B}}}{\\theta_{*} p_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\implies \\theta_{\\mathrm{B}} = K_{\\mathrm{B}} p_{\\mathrm{B}} \\theta_{*}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the site balance equation:\n$$\n\\theta_{*} + (K_{\\mathrm{A}} p_{\\mathrm{A}} \\theta_{*}) + (K_{\\mathrm{B}} p_{\\mathrm{B}} \\theta_{*}) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{*} (1 + K_{\\mathrm{A}} p_{\\mathrm{A}} + K_{\\mathrm{B}} p_{\\mathrm{B}}) = 1\n$$\nSolving for the vacant site coverage $\\theta_{*}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{*} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{\\mathrm{A}} p_{\\mathrm{A}} + K_{\\mathrm{B}} p_{\\mathrm{B}}}\n$$\nNow, we find the reactant coverage $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}} = K_{\\mathrm{A}} p_{\\mathrm{A}} \\theta_{*} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{A}} p_{\\mathrm{A}}}{1 + K_{\\mathrm{A}} p_{\\mathrm{A}} + K_{\\mathrm{B}} p_{\\mathrm{B}}}\n$$\nThe adsorption equilibrium constants $K_X$ are related to the standard Gibbs free energy of adsorption $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads},X}$:\n$$\nK_{X} = \\frac{1}{p_{0}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads},X}}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{1}{p_{0}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{X} - T \\Delta S_{X}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nGiven $p_{0} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nK_{X} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{X} - T \\Delta S_{X}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $k_2$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{A}}$ into the TOF equation yields the final governing expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TOF}(E_{\\mathrm{A}}, E_{\\mathrm{B}}, E_{\\mathrm{a}}) = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{RT}\\right) \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{A}} p_{\\mathrm{A}}}{1 + K_{\\mathrm{A}} p_{\\mathrm{A}} + K_{\\mathrm{B}} p_{\\mathrm{B}}}\n$$\nExplicitly, this is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{TOF} = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{a}}}{RT}\\right) \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{A}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{A}} - T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{A}}}{RT}\\right)}{1 + p_{\\mathrm{A}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{A}} - T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{A}}}{RT}\\right) + p_{\\mathrm{B}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{B}} - T\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{B}}}{RT}\\right)}\n$$\nThis equation serves as the basis for all subsequent numerical calculations.\n\n#### 2. Computational Strategy\n\nFor each parameter set, two optimization problems must be solved. All energies given in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ will be converted to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ by multiplying by $1000$.\n\n**Part 1: Single-Descriptor Volcano**\nThe goal is to find $\\mathrm{TOF}_{\\max,volcano} = \\max_{E_{\\mathrm{A}}} \\mathrm{TOF}(E_{\\mathrm{A}})$.\n1.  A discrete grid for the descriptor $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is created over the interval $[E_{\\mathrm{A,min}}, E_{\\mathrm{A,max}}]$ with $N_{E}$ points.\n2.  For each value of $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$ on the grid, the dependent energies $E_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are calculated using the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) scaling relations:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\alpha E_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\beta$$\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{B}} = c_{1} E_{\\mathrm{A}} + c_{0}$$\n3.  The TOF is calculated using the derived governing equation for each point on the $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$ grid.\n4.  The maximum value among all calculated TOFs is identified as $\\mathrm{TOF}_{\\max,volcano}$.\n\n**Part 2: Multi-Descriptor Space (Broken Scaling)**\nThe goal is to find $\\mathrm{TOF}_{\\max,broken} = \\max_{E_{\\mathrm{A}}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\mathrm{TOF}(E_{\\mathrm{A}}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{B}})$.\n1.  Three discrete grids are created:\n    -   $E_{\\mathrm{A}}$ over $[E_{\\mathrm{A,min}}, E_{\\mathrm{A,max}}]$ with $N_{E}$ points.\n    -   $\\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}$ over $[-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}, +\\Delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}]$ with $N_{\\delta}$ points.\n    -   $\\delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ over $[-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}, +\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}]$ with $N_{\\delta}$ points.\n2.  A three-dimensional search is performed over the Cartesian product of these three grids.\n3.  For each point $(E_{\\mathrm{A}}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}, \\delta_{\\mathrm{B}})$ in the 3D space, the energies $E_{\\mathrm{a}}'$ and $E_{\\mathrm{B}}'$ are calculated using the broken scaling relations:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{a}}' = \\alpha E_{\\mathrm{A}} + \\beta + \\delta_{\\mathrm{TS}}$$\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{B}}' = c_{1} E_{\\mathrm{A}} + c_{0} + \\delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$$\n4.  The TOF is calculated using the governing equation with $E_{\\mathrm{a}}'$ and $E_{\\mathrm{B}}'$ for each point in the 3D grid.\n5.  The global maximum value among all calculated TOFs is identified as $\\mathrm{TOF}_{\\max,broken}$.\n\n**Part 3: Improvement Factor**\nThe improvement factor is computed as the ratio of the two maximal TOFs:\n$$\n\\text{Improvement Factor} = \\frac{\\mathrm{TOF}_{\\max,broken}}{\\mathrm{TOF}_{\\max,volcano}}\n$$\nThis factor quantifies the catalytic performance gain achievable by moving from a single-descriptor design space to a multi-descriptor one that allows for breaking of linear scaling relations.
