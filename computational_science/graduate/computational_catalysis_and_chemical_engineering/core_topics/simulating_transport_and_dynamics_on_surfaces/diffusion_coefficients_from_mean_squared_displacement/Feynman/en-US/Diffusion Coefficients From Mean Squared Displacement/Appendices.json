            "solution": "The problem requires a dimensional analysis of three quantities based on fundamental definitions. The base dimensions used are mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$). For a quantity $X$, its physical dimension will be denoted by $[X]$.\n\n1.  **Physical Dimensions of Mean Squared Displacement, $\\langle \\Delta r^{2}(t) \\rangle$**\n\nThe Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) is defined as $\\langle \\Delta r^{2}(t) \\rangle \\equiv \\left\\langle \\left| \\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0) \\right|^{2} \\right\\rangle$. We analyze the dimensions of each component of this definition.\nThe term $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ represents a position vector in $d$-dimensional space. The physical dimension of a position vector is length, so $[\\mathbf{r}(t)] = L$.\nThe difference of two position vectors, $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)$, is a displacement vector, which also has the dimension of length: $[\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t)] = L$.\nThe term $|\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|$ is the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of the displacement vector. Its dimension is also length.\nThe quantity inside the average is the square of this magnitude, $|\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2$. The dimension of a squared length is $[|\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2] = L^2$.\nThe angular brackets, $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$, denote an ensemble average. An average is calculated by summing a set of values and dividing by the count of those values. This operation is dimensionless, meaning it does not alter the physical dimensions of the quantity being averaged. Therefore, $[\\langle X \\rangle] = [X]$.\nApplying this, the dimensions of the MSD are the same as the dimensions of the squared displacement:\n$[\\langle \\Delta r^{2}(t) \\rangle] = [|\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2] = L^2$.\nIn terms of the base dimensions $M$, $L$, and $T$, this is expressed as $M^0 L^2 T^0$. The corresponding exponent triple $(M,L,T)$ is $(0, 2, 0)$.\n\n2.  **Physical Dimensions of the Diffusion Coefficient, $D$**\n\nFick's first law provides the definition of the diffusion coefficient, $D$, through the relation between molar flux, $J$, and the concentration gradient, $\\nabla C$: $J = -D \\nabla C$. The negative sign is a dimensionless factor of $-1$. The dimensions of $D$ can be determined by isolating it from the equation: $[D] = \\frac{[J]}{[\\nabla C]}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the dimensions of molar flux, $J$. Flux is the amount of substance that crosses a unit area per unit time. Let the dimension for amount of substance be denoted $N_{subst}$. Area has dimensions of $L^2$, and time has dimensions of $T$.\nThus, the dimensions of flux are $[J] = \\frac{N_{subst}}{L^2 T} = N_{subst} L^{-2} T^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we establish the dimensions of the concentration gradient, $\\nabla C$.\nConcentration, $C$, is the amount of substance per unit volume. Volume has dimensions of $L^3$.\nSo, the dimensions of concentration are $[C] = \\frac{N_{subst}}{L^3} = N_{subst} L^{-3}$.\nThe gradient operator, $\\nabla$, involves spatial derivatives (e.g., $\\partial/\\partial x$), and thus has dimensions of inverse length, $[\\nabla] = L^{-1}$.\nThe dimensions of the concentration gradient are therefore $[\\nabla C] = [\\nabla][C] = L^{-1} \\cdot (N_{subst} L^{-3}) = N_{subst} L^{-4}$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these results to find the dimensions of $D$:\n$$ [D] = \\frac{[J]}{[\\nabla C]} = \\frac{N_{subst} L^{-2} T^{-1}}{N_{subst} L^{-4}} $$\nThe dimension for amount of substance, $N_{subst}$, cancels out as specified in the problem statement.\n$$ [D] = \\frac{L^{-2} T^{-1}}{L^{-4}} = L^{-2 - (-4)} T^{-1} = L^2 T^{-1} $$\nIn terms of base dimensions $M$, $L$, and $T$, this is $M^0 L^2 T^{-1}$. The corresponding exponent triple $(M,L,T)$ is $(0, 2, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Dimensional Consistency of the Ratio, $R$**\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as $R \\equiv \\frac{\\langle \\Delta r^{2}(t) \\rangle}{2\\,d\\,D\\,t}$. To check for dimensional consistency, we find the net dimensions of $R$ by dividing the dimensions of the numerator by the dimensions of the denominator.\n$$ [R] = \\frac{[\\langle \\Delta r^{2}(t) \\rangle]}{[2] [d] [D] [t]} $$\nWe use the dimensions determined in the previous parts and for the other terms:\n- From part 1, the dimensions of the numerator are $[\\langle \\Delta r^{2}(t) \\rangle] = L^2$.\n- The number $2$ is a dimensionless constant, so $[2]=1$.\n- The spatial dimensionality $d$ is a pure number, so $[d]=1$.\n- From part 2, the dimensions of the diffusion coefficient are $[D] = L^2 T^{-1}$.\n- The dimension of time $t$ is $[t] = T$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{L^2}{(1) \\cdot (1) \\cdot (L^2 T^{-1}) \\cdot (T)} = \\frac{L^2}{L^2 T^{(-1+1)}} = \\frac{L^2}{L^2 T^0} = 1 $$\nThe result is a value of $1$, indicating that the ratio $R$ is a dimensionless quantity. A dimensionless quantity has exponents of zero for all base dimensions.\nIn terms of base dimensions $M$, $L$, and $T$, this is $M^0 L^0 T^0$. The corresponding exponent triple $(M,L,T)$ is $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final result as a single row matrix concatenating the exponent triples $(M,L,T)$ for (i) $\\langle \\Delta r^{2}(t) \\rangle$, (ii) $D$, and (iii) $R$.\nThe triples are $(0, 2, 0)$, $(0, 2, -1)$, and $(0, 0, 0)$, respectively.",

First, a symbolic expression for the diffusion coefficient $D$ in SI units is derived from fundamental principles and the given parameters. Second, this expression is evaluated numerically using the provided data.\n\n**Part 1: Symbolic Derivation of the Diffusion Coefficient**\n\nThe three-dimensional Einstein relation defines the diffusion coefficient $D$ in terms of the long-time behavior of the mean squared displacement (MSD), $\\langle|\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|^{2}\\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle|\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|^{2}\\rangle = 6Dt $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ is the position of the particle at time $t$, and $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)$.

The relationships between quantities in SI units (un-starred) and LJ reduced units (starred) are:\n1.  Length: $r = r^{*} \\sigma$\n2.  Energy: $E = E^{*} \\epsilon$\n3.  Time: $t = t^{*} \\tau$\n\nThe characteristic time unit, $\\tau$, is derived from the base units by dimensional analysis. From kinetic energy, we know energy has dimensions of mass $\\times$ (length/time)$^2$. In terms of the LJ base units:\n$$ \\epsilon \\sim m \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\tau}\\right)^2 $$\nSolving for $\\tau$ gives the definition of the LJ time unit:\n$$ \\tau = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\epsilon}} $$\n\nNow, we express the Einstein relation using reduced units.

This slope corresponds to the derivative in the long-time limit:\n$$ s^{*} = \\frac{d}{dt^{*}} \\langle|\\Delta \\mathbf{r}^{*}(t^{*})|^{2}\\rangle $$\nIn the reduced unit system, the Einstein relation is $\\langle|\\Delta \\mathbf{r}^{*}(t^{*})|^{2}\\rangle = 6D^{*}t^{*}$, where $D^{*}$ is the diffusion coefficient in reduced units. The slope is therefore $6D^{*}$. Thus, we have:\n$$ s^{*} = 6D^{*} \\implies D^{*} = \\frac{s^{*}}{6} $$\nNow we rearrange the transformed Einstein relation to solve for $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{6t^{*}\\tau} \\langle|\\Delta r^{*}|^{2}\\rangle = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\tau} \\left( \\frac{\\langle|\\Delta r^{*}|^{2}\\rangle}{6t^{*}} \\right) $$\nRecognizing that the term in the parentheses is $D^{*}$, we get the relationship between the SI diffusion coefficient $D$ and the reduced diffusion coefficient $D^{*}$:\n$$ D = D^{*} \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\tau} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $D^{*}$ and $\\tau$:\n$$ D = \\left(\\frac{s^{*}}{6}\\right) \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{m}{\\epsilon}}} = \\frac{s^{*}}{6} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{m}} $$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the diffusion coefficient $D$ in SI units in terms of the given parameters.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $s^{*} = 0.33$ (dimensionless)\n- $\\epsilon_{\\text{molar}} = 0.75 \\,\\text{kJ/mol}$\n- $\\sigma = 0.35 \\,\\text{nm}$\n- $m_{\\text{molar}} = 74.12 \\,\\text{g/mol}$\n- $N_{A} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$\n\nThe symbolic formula for $D$ requires the energy $\\epsilon$ and mass $m$ of a single particle.

We have:\n$$\n6D = 2.10\\,\\mathrm{nm^2/ns}\n$$\nSolving for $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{2.10}{6}\\,\\mathrm{nm^2/ns} = 0.350\\,\\mathrm{nm^2/ns}\n$$\nFinally, we convert the units of $D$ to $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$ as requested.\nThe conversion factors are $1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $1\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\nD = 0.350 \\frac{(\\mathrm{nm})^2}{\\mathrm{ns}} = 0.350 \\frac{(10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 0.350 \\frac{10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 0.350 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation and rounding to three significant figures (which it already has):\n$$\nD = 3.50 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3.50 \\times 10^{-10}}\n$$"
