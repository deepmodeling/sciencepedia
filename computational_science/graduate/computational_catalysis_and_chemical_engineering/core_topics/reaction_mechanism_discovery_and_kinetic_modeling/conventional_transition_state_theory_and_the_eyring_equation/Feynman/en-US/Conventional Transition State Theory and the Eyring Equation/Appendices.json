            "introduction": "In practical catalysis, the activation energy measured from an Arrhenius plot, known as the apparent activation energy ($E_{\\text{app}}$), rarely equals the intrinsic enthalpic barrier ($\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$) of the rate-determining step. This is because the overall observed rate is a product of both kinetics and the thermodynamics of preceding steps, such as reactant adsorption. This exercise  guides you through a derivation that reveals how the temperature dependence of reactant surface coverage and the TST prefactor itself contribute to the experimentally observed activation energy, a critical skill for bridging theory and experiment.",

            "problem": "Consider a heterogeneous catalytic reaction network on a uniform surface with one dominant reactive step. A gas-phase species $A(\\text{g})$ adsorbs reversibly onto a vacant site $\\ast$ to form an adsorbed intermediate $A\\ast$, which then undergoes a unimolecular surface reaction over a saddle point (transition state) to form product $P\\ast$ that subsequently desorbs rapidly. Assume that product desorption is sufficiently fast to be non-rate-limiting and that $A(\\text{g}) \\rightleftharpoons A\\ast$ is quasi-equilibrated at the temperatures of interest. The overall rate is controlled by the elementary surface reaction $A\\ast \\to P\\ast$.\n\nStarting from the canonical ensemble and the definition of reaction rate as the thermally averaged positive flux across a dividing surface at the saddle point, and invoking the conventional Transition State Theory (TST) with a unit transmission coefficient, derive a form for the rate constant $k(T)$ of the surface reaction in terms of the standard Gibbs free energy of activation $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T)$ for $A\\ast \\to \\text{TS}^{\\ddagger}$. Your derivation should begin from partition functions and the Boltzmann distribution, and logically explain how entropic contributions lead to an explicit temperature factor in $k(T)$.\n\nIndependently, use equilibrium statistical mechanics for adsorption to obtain the coverage $\\theta_{A}(T)$ under a Langmuirian adsorption model as a function of temperature and gas partial pressure $p_{A}$, assuming an equilibrium constant $K_{\\text{ads}}(T)$ expressible via the standard enthalpy and entropy of adsorption, $\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}}$, referenced to a standard pressure $p^{\\circ}$. You may assume ideal gas behavior and a single-site adsorption with non-interacting adsorbates.\n\nDefine the apparent activation energy $E_{\\text{app}}(T)$ of the overall rate $r(T)$ by\n$$\nE_{\\text{app}}(T) \\equiv - R \\,\\frac{d \\ln r(T)}{d(1/T)} \\, ,\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the molar gas constant and $r(T) = k(T)\\,\\theta_{A}(T)$.\n\nShow, by explicit differentiation of your derived $r(T)$, that $E_{\\text{app}}(T)$ generally differs from the standard enthalpic barrier $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$ because of entropic effects and thermodynamic coupling to the adsorption equilibrium.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It represents a standard problem in chemical kinetics and heterogeneous catalysis that combines conventional Transition State Theory (TST) with the Langmuir adsorption model. All provided parameters are physically realistic, and the derivation and calculation steps are clearly defined. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be furnished.\n\nThe overall observed rate of reaction, $r(T)$, is given by the product of the intrinsic rate constant for the surface reaction, $k(T)$, and the surface coverage of the reactant intermediate $A\\ast$, denoted as $\\theta_A(T)$.\n$$r(T) = k(T)\\,\\theta_{A}(T)$$\nWe will derive expressions for $k(T)$ and $\\theta_A(T)$ separately, then combine them to find the apparent activation energy, $E_{\\text{app}}(T)$.\n\nDerivation of the surface reaction rate constant, $k(T)$:\nThe rate constant for the elementary step $A\\ast \\to P\\ast$ is described by conventional Transition State Theory (TST). The TST expression for the rate constant, assuming a transmission coefficient $\\kappa=1$, is given by the Eyring equation:\n$$k(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, $R$ is the molar gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the standard Gibbs free energy of activation for the process $A\\ast \\to \\text{TS}^{\\ddagger}$.\nThis equation arises from considering the equilibrium between the reactant $A\\ast$ and the transition state species $\\text{TS}^{\\ddagger}$. The rate is the flux of species passing through the transition state. The pre-factor $\\frac{k_B T}{h}$ represents a universal frequency for crossing the barrier, derived from the classical kinetic energy of motion along the reaction coordinate. The exponential term is the equilibrium constant for forming the transition state from the reactant.\n\nThe problem asks to explain the origin of the explicit temperature factor. The term linear in $T$ in the pre-exponential factor fundamentally arises from the thermal energy, $k_B T$, available to the system to surmount the activation barrier. More formally, in the derivation from partition functions, the partition function for the translational motion along the unbound reaction coordinate at the transition state is proportional to $T^{1/2}$, and the average velocity along this coordinate is also proportional to $T^{1/2}$, leading to a combined linear dependence on $T$.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of activation is related to the standard enthalpy ($\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$) and entropy ($\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$) of activation by the thermodynamic relation:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(T) = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger} - T\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}$$\nSubstituting this into the Eyring equation, we obtain the temperature dependence of $k(T)$ in terms of the activation enthalpy and entropy:\n$$k(T) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger} - T\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}}{R}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{RT}\\right)$$\nThis is the desired form for the rate constant.\n\nDerivation of the surface coverage, $\\theta_A(T)$:\nThe adsorption of species $A$ is described by the reversible quasi-equilibrated process $A(\\text{g}) + \\ast \\rightleftharpoons A\\ast$. Under the Langmuirian adsorption model (single-site adsorption, non-interacting adsorbates on a uniform surface), the equilibrium is described by an equilibrium constant $K_{\\text{ads}}(T)$.\n$$K_{\\text{ads}}(T) = \\frac{\\theta_A}{\\left(\\frac{p_A}{p^{\\circ}}\\right)\\theta_{\\ast}}$$\nwhere $\\theta_A$ is the fractional coverage of species $A$, $\\theta_{\\ast}$ is the fractional coverage of vacant sites $\\ast$, $p_A$ is the partial pressure of $A$ in the gas phase, and $p^{\\circ}$ is the standard pressure. The site balance requires $\\theta_A + \\theta_{\\ast} = 1$, so $\\theta_{\\ast} = 1 - \\theta_A$. Substituting this into the equilibrium expression gives:\n$$K_{\\text{ads}}(T) = \\frac{\\theta_A}{\\left(\\frac{p_A}{p^{\\circ}}\\right)(1 - \\theta_A)}$$\nSolving for $\\theta_A$ yields the Langmuir isotherm:\n$$\\theta_A(T) = \\frac{K_{\\text{ads}}(T) \\frac{p_A}{p^{\\circ}}}{1 + K_{\\text{ads}}(T) \\frac{p_A}{p^{\\circ}}}$$\nThe equilibrium constant $K_{\\text{ads}}(T)$ is related to the standard Gibbs free energy of adsorption, $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}(T)$, by $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}(T) = -RT \\ln K_{\\text{ads}}(T)$. Using $\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}(T) = \\Delta H_{\\text{ads}} - T\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}}$, where $\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}}$ are the standard enthalpy and entropy of adsorption, we get:\n$$K_{\\text{ads}}(T) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{ads}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}} - T\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}}}{R}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}}{RT}\\right)$$\n\nDerivation of the apparent activation energy, $E_{\\text{app}}(T)$:\nThe apparent activation energy is defined as:\n$$E_{\\text{app}}(T) = -R \\frac{d \\ln r(T)}{d(1/T)}$$\nThe overall rate is $r(T) = k(T)\\theta_A(T)$, so $\\ln r(T) = \\ln k(T) + \\ln \\theta_A(T)$. The derivative can be taken term by term:\n$$E_{\\text{app}}(T) = \\left(-R \\frac{d \\ln k(T)}{d(1/T)}\\right) + \\left(-R \\frac{d \\ln \\theta_A(T)}{d(1/T)}\\right)$$\nFor the first term, we use our expression for $k(T)$:\n$$\\ln k(T) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{h}\\right) + \\ln T + \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{RT}$$\nLet $x = 1/T$, so $T = 1/x$ and $\\ln T = -\\ln x$. The derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\\frac{d \\ln k(T)}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_B}{h}\\right) - \\ln x + \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\ddagger}}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{R}x\\right) = -\\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{R} = -T - \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{R}$$\nThus, the first term for $E_{\\text{app}}(T)$ is:\n$$-R \\frac{d \\ln k(T)}{d(1/T)} = -R\\left(-T - \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}}{R}\\right) = RT + \\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$$\nFor the second term, we differentiate $\\ln \\theta_A$. From the Langmuir isotherm, it is simpler to note that $\\theta_A = \\frac{K'}{1+K'}$ where $K' = K_{\\text{ads}}(T)(p_A/p^{\\circ})$. We also have the relation $1-\\theta_A = \\frac{1}{1+K'}$. The logarithmic derivative is:\n$$\\frac{d \\ln \\theta_A}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{d}{d(1/T)} \\left[ \\ln K' - \\ln(1+K') \\right] = \\frac{d \\ln K'}{d(1/T)} - \\frac{1}{1+K'}\\frac{dK'}{d(1/T)}$$\nSince $\\frac{dK'}{d(1/T)} = K'\\frac{d\\ln K'}{d(1/T)}$, this becomes:\n$$\\frac{d \\ln \\theta_A}{d(1/T)} = \\left(1-\\frac{K'}{1+K'}\\right)\\frac{d \\ln K'}{d(1/T)} = (1-\\theta_A)\\frac{d \\ln K'}{d(1/T)}$$\nThe term $\\ln K' = \\ln K_{\\text{ads}} + \\ln(p_A/p^{\\circ})$. Since $p_A$ and $p^{\\circ}$ are constant, $\\frac{d \\ln K'}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{d \\ln K_{\\text{ads}}}{d(1/T)}$. From the van't Hoff equation:\n$$\\frac{d \\ln K_{\\text{ads}}}{d(1/T)} = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}}{R}$$\nSo, $\\frac{d \\ln \\theta_A}{d(1/T)} = (1-\\theta_A)\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}}{R}\\right)$. The second term for $E_{\\text{app}}(T)$ is:\n$$-R \\frac{d \\ln \\theta_A(T)}{d(1/T)} = -R(1-\\theta_A)\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}}{R}\\right) = (1-\\theta_A)\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}$$\nCombining both terms yields the full expression for the apparent activation energy:\n$$E_{\\text{app}}(T) = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger} + RT + (1-\\theta_A(T))\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}$$\nThis expression shows that $E_{\\text{app}}(T)$ is generally not equal to the intrinsic enthalpic barrier $\\Delta H^{\\ddagger}$. It includes a contribution from the thermal energy, $RT$, as dictated by TST, and a contribution from the temperature dependence of the reactant surface coverage, $(1-\\theta_A(T))\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}$. This second term reflects the thermodynamic coupling between the adsorption equilibrium and the surface reaction kinetics.\n\nNumerical Calculation at $T=600\\,\\text{K}$:\nWe are given:\n$\\Delta H^{\\ddagger} = 85\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = 85000\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta S^{\\ddagger} = -10\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}} = -100\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = -100000\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}} = -120\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$p_A = 0.10\\,\\text{bar}$, $p^{\\circ} = 1\\,\\text{bar}$\n$T = 600\\,\\text{K}$\n$R = 8.314\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the adsorption equilibrium constant $K_{\\text{ads}}(600\\,\\text{K})$:\n$$K_{\\text{ads}}(600\\,\\text{K}) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S_{\\text{ads}}}{R}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}}{RT}\\right)$$\n$$K_{\\text{ads}}(600\\,\\text{K}) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{-120}{8.314}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{-100000}{8.314 \\times 600}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-14.433) \\exp(20.047) = \\exp(5.614)$$\n$$K_{\\text{ads}}(600\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 274.2$$\nNext, we calculate the surface coverage $\\theta_A(600\\,\\text{K})$:\n$$\\theta_A(600\\,\\text{K}) = \\frac{K_{\\text{ads}}(600\\,\\text{K}) \\frac{p_A}{p^{\\circ}}}{1 + K_{\\text{ads}}(600\\,\\text{K}) \\frac{p_A}{p^{\\circ}}} = \\frac{274.2 \\times 0.10}{1 + 274.2 \\times 0.10} = \\frac{27.42}{28.42}$$\n$$\\theta_A(600\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 0.9648$$\nNow, we can calculate $E_{\\text{app}}(600\\,\\text{K})$:\n$$E_{\\text{app}}(600\\,\\text{K}) = \\Delta H^{\\ddagger} + RT + (1-\\theta_A(600\\,\\text{K}))\\Delta H_{\\text{ads}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{app}}(600\\,\\text{K}) = 85000\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} + (8.314\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} \\times 600\\,\\text{K}) + (1 - 0.9648)(-100000\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1})$$\n$$E_{\\text{app}}(600\\,\\text{K}) = 85000 + 4988.4 + (0.0352)(-100000) = 85000 + 4988.4 - 3520$$\n$$E_{\\text{app}}(600\\,\\text{K}) = 86468.4\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = 86.4684\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $86.47\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.\n(Using higher precision for intermediate steps:\n$K_{\\text{ads}} = 273.96$; $\\theta_A = 0.96478$; $1-\\theta_A = 0.035216$;\n$E_{\\text{app}} = 85000 + 4988.4 + (0.035216 \\times -100000) = 85000 + 4988.4 - 3521.6 = 86466.8\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1} = 86.4668\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $86.47\\,\\text{kJ}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}$.)",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It requires the derivation and application of the fundamental equation of Variational Transition State Theory (VTST) to a set of model chemical systems. The provided physical constants, functional forms, and parameters are appropriate for a problem in computational chemical kinetics. A minor ambiguity exists in the output specification: the instruction \"exactly six significant figures\" is inconsistent with the provided example \"$1.234560\\mathrm{e}{-03}$\", which has seven significant figures. I shall resolve this by adhering to the format of the example, which corresponds to seven significant figures (one digit before and six digits after the decimal point in standard scientific notation). The problem is otherwise valid and admits a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe theoretical foundation of this problem is the calculation of a chemical reaction rate constant using transition state theory (TST). The objective of VTST is to find the optimal location of the dividing surface between reactants and products to obtain the best estimate of the rate constant. This is achieved by minimizing the conventional TST rate constant, $k(s,T)$, with respect to the reaction coordinate, $s$.\n\nWe begin by deriving the expression for the conventional TST rate constant, $k(s,T)$, from first principles as stipulated. The derivation rests on three pillars: the assumption of a thermal equilibrium between reactants and activated complexes (derived from the canonical ensemble), the flux-over-population principle, and the quantization of phase space embodied by Planck's constant, $h$.\n\nIn TST, the rate constant $k$ is defined as the unidirectional flux of reacting systems through a dividing surface, normalized by the population of reactants. For a unimolecular reaction $\\mathrm{R} \\to \\mathrm{P}$, this is expressed in terms of concentrations as:\n$$ k = \\nu \\frac{[\\mathrm{TS}]}{[\\mathrm{R}]} $$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{R}]$ is the concentration of the reactant, $[\\mathrm{TS}]$ is the concentration of activated complexes at the dividing surface, and $\\nu$ is the frequency with which these complexes proceed to form products.\n\nFirst, we establish the concentration of activated complexes, $[\\mathrm{TS}](s)$, located at a specific dividing surface parameterized by $s$. Assuming a quasi-equilibrium between reactants and activated complexes, we can write an equilibrium-like constant, $K^\\ddagger(s,T)$:\n$$ K^\\ddagger(s,T) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{TS}](s)}{[\\mathrm{R}]} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{TS}}(s,T)}{Q_{\\mathrm{R}}(T)} e^{-V(s) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)} $$\nHere, $Q_{\\mathrm{R}}(T)$ is the partition function of the reactant species, and $Q_{\\mathrm{TS}}(s,T)$ is the partition function of the activated complex, both per unit volume. The potential energy at the dividing surface relative to the reactant minimum is $V(s)$. $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem provides dimensionless partition functions, assuming the volume factors have been handled. The partition function of the activated complex, $Q_{\\mathrm{TS}}(s,T)$, is factored into a component for the translational motion along the reaction coordinate, $q_{rc}$, and a component for all other bounded degrees of freedom, $Q^\\ddagger(s,T)$:\n$$ Q_{\\mathrm{TS}}(s,T) = q_{rc} Q^\\ddagger(s,T) $$\n\nNext, we determine the crossing frequency, $\\nu$. This is the inverse of the time required for an activated complex to traverse the infinitesimal width of the dividing surface, $\\delta$. The average velocity of species moving in the forward direction (e.g., positive momentum $p_s$) in one dimension is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as $\\langle v_s \\rangle_{v_s > 0} = \\sqrt{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T / (2\\pi m_{rc})}$, where $m_{rc}$ is the effective mass for motion along the reaction coordinate. The crossing frequency is $\\nu = \\langle v_s \\rangle_{v_s > 0} / \\delta$.\n\nTo proceed and reveal the universal frequency factor, we model the motion along the reaction coordinate within the transition state region as free translation in one dimension. The partition function for this motion over the length $\\delta$ is:\n$$ q_{rc} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{rc} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h^2}\\right)^{1/2} \\delta $$\nThe use of Planck's constant, $h$ (the \"quantum of action\"), fundamentally arises from the quantization of phase space, where each quantum state occupies a phase space volume of $h^f$ for a system with $f$ degrees of freedom.\n\nSubstituting these components into the initial rate expression:\n$$ k(s,T) = \\nu K^\\ddagger(s,T) = \\left(\\frac{\\langle v_s \\rangle_{v_s > 0}}{\\delta}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q_{rc} Q^\\ddagger(s,T)}{Q_{\\mathrm{R}}(T)} e^{-V(s) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)}\\right) $$\n$$ k(s,T) = \\frac{1}{\\delta} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{2\\pi m_{rc}}} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2\\pi m_{rc} k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{h^2}\\right)^{1/2} \\delta \\right] \\frac{Q^\\ddagger(s,T)}{Q_{\\mathrm{R}}(T)} e^{-V(s) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)} $$\nThe auxiliary parameters $\\delta$ and $m_{rc}$ cancel, yielding the celebrated Eyring-Polanyi equation for the rate constant at a given dividing surface $s$:\n$$ k(s,T) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} \\frac{Q^\\ddagger(s,T)}{Q_{\\mathrm{R}}(T)} e^{-V(s) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)} $$\nThe term $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T/h$ has units of frequency ($\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) and represents a universal frequency for crossing a barrier at temperature $T$.\n\nThe final step is to apply the variational principle. The fundamental assumption of TST is that any trajectory crossing the dividing surface from reactants to products does so only once and proceeds irreversibly to the product state. This \"no-recrossing\" assumption is an idealization. In reality, dynamical trajectories can recross the dividing surface. Consequently, TST overestimates the true flux of reactive trajectories and the resulting rate constant, $k(s,T)$, is a strict upper bound to the true classical rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{true}}(T)$:\n$$ k(s,T) \\ge k_{\\mathrm{true}}(T) $$\nVariational Transition State Theory (VTST) seeks to optimize the choice of the dividing surface to minimize this overestimation. The best approximation to the true rate constant is obtained by finding the dividing surface that minimizes the calculated rate. This surface represents the true dynamical bottleneck of the reaction. Therefore, the VTST rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{VTST}}(T)$, is given by:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{VTST}}(T) = \\min_{s} k(s,T) = \\min_{s} \\left[ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} \\frac{Q^\\ddagger(s)}{Q_{\\mathrm{R}}} e^{-V(s) / (k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)} \\right] $$\nThe problem requires us to compute this minimum over a discrete grid of $s$ values. The procedure is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, establish a uniform grid of $s$ values over the specified interval.\n2.  For each point $s_i$ in the grid, evaluate the potential energy $V(s_i)$ and the transition-state partition function $Q^\\ddagger(s_i)$.\n3.  Calculate the rate constant $k(s_i, T)$ using the derived Eyring-Polanyi equation.\n4.  The variational rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{VTST}}(T)$ is the minimum value found in the array of calculated $k(s_i, T)$ values.\nThis procedure will be implemented for each of the four test cases provided.",
