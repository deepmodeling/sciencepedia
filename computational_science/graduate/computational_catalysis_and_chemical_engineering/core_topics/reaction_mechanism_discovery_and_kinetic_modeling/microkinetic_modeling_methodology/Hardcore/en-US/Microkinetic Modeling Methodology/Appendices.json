The tasks—constructing the matrix, finding its rank, and identifying a basis for its column space—are standard linear algebra operations with definite answers.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is posed in objective, formal language, free of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound for the intended mathematical analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid.

Let the column vectors of $S$ be $\\mathbf{v}_1$, $\\mathbf{v}_2$, and $\\mathbf{v}_3$. We test for linear independence by solving the equation $c_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\mathbf{v}_2 + c_3 \\mathbf{v}_3 = \\mathbf{0}$ for scalars $c_1, c_2, c_3$.\n\nThis vector equation corresponds to the following system of linear equations:\n1.  $-c_1 = 0$\n2.  $c_3 = 0$\n3.  $-c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 0$\n4.  $c_1 - c_2 = 0$\n5.  $-c_2 = 0$\n6.  $c_2 - c_3 = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1), we find $c_1 = 0$.\nFrom equation (2), we find $c_3 = 0$.\nFrom equation (5), we find $c_2 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the remaining equations (3, 4, 6) shows they are satisfied:\n-   $-(0) + (0) + (0) = 0$\n-   $(0) - (0) = 0$\n-   $(0) - (0) = 0$\n\nSince the only solution is the trivial one, $c_1 = c_2 = c_3 = 0$, the column vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1$, $\\mathbf{v}_2$, and $\\mathbf{v}_3$ are linearly independent.\n\nThe rank of $S$ is the number of linearly independent columns, which is $3$.\nAn alternative method is to find a $k \\times k$ submatrix with a non-zero determinant, which proves the rank is at least $k$. Consider the submatrix formed by rows 1, 2, and 5:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this submatrix is $\\det(M) = -1 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -1 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot (-1)) = -1 \\cdot (1) = -1$.\nSince there exists a $3 \\times 3$ submatrix with a non-zero determinant, the rank of $S$ is at least $3$. As $S$ only has $3$ columns, its rank cannot exceed $3$. Therefore, the rank of $S$ is exactly $3$.\n\n**Part 3: Identification of a Minimal Independent Set of Reaction Extents**\n\nA minimal independent set of reaction extents corresponds to a basis for the column space of $S$. The dimension of the column space is the rank, which we determined to be $3$.\nThe number of reactions (and thus the number of columns in $S$) is also $3$.\nSince the rank of the matrix equals the number of columns, the entire set of columns is linearly independent. This means the set of all three reactions, corresponding to reaction extents $\\xi_1$, $\\xi_2$, and $\\xi_3$, forms a basis for the column space.\n\nTherefore, a minimal independent set of reactions is the set of all given reactions, whose indices are $1$, $2$, and $3$.\n\nThe final answer combines the rank $r=3$ and the indices of this set, $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$, into a single row matrix.",

Calculate the absolute relative error $E = \\lvert r_{\\mathrm{red}} - r_{\\mathrm{full}} \\rvert / r_{\\mathrm{full}}$ for five given parameter sets.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a standard exercise in chemical reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of microkinetic modeling, using the Law of Mass Action and well-established approximations (QE, QSSA). The problem is well-posed, providing a complete set of equations, parameters, and a clearly defined objective. The language is formal and objective. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Derivation of the Full Steady-State Rate Expression ($r_{\\mathrm{full}}$)\n\nAt steady-state, the time derivatives of the coverages are zero, $d\\theta_A/dt = 0$ and $d\\theta_I/dt = 0$. The ODE system becomes a system of algebraic equations:\n$$ k_{1f} P_A \\theta_* - k_{1r} \\theta_A - k_{2f} P_B \\theta_A + k_{2r} \\theta_I = 0 \\quad (1) $$\n$$ k_{2f} P_B \\theta_A - k_{2r} \\theta_I - k_3 \\theta_I = 0 \\quad (2) $$\nThe site balance equation is:\n$$ \\theta_* = 1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_I \\quad (3) $$\nFrom equation ($2$), we solve for $\\theta_I$ in terms of $\\theta_A$:\n$$ k_{2f} P_B \\theta_A = (k_{2r} + k_3) \\theta_I $$\n$$ \\theta_I = \\left( \\frac{k_{2f} P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3} \\right) \\theta_A \\quad (4) $$\nThis is an exact relationship at steady state. Next, we substitute equation ($3$) into equation ($1$):\n$$ k_{1f} P_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_I) - k_{1r} \\theta_A - k_{2f} P_B \\theta_A + k_{2r} \\theta_I = 0 $$\nRearranging to isolate the constant term and group terms by coverage:\n$$ k_{1f} P_A = (k_{1f} P_A + k_{1r} + k_{2f} P_B) \\theta_A + (k_{1f} P_A - k_{2r}) \\theta_I \\quad (5) $$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations, ($4$) and ($5$), for the two unknown coverages $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_I$. Substitute $\\theta_I$ from ($4$) into ($5$):\n$$ k_{1f} P_A = \\left( k_{1f} P_A + k_{1r} + k_{2f} P_B \\right) \\theta_A + (k_{1f} P_A - k_{2r}) \\left( \\frac{k_{2f} P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3} \\right) \\theta_A $$\nFactor out $\\theta_A$ and combine the coefficients over a common denominator:\n$$ k_{1f} P_A = \\left[ \\frac{(k_{1f} P_A + k_{1r} + k_{2f} P_B)(k_{2r} + k_3) + (k_{1f} P_A - k_{2r}) k_{2f} P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3} \\right] \\theta_A $$\nExpanding the numerator inside the brackets and simplifying by canceling the $\\pm k_{2f} P_B k_{2r}$ terms, we obtain:\n$$ k_{1f} P_A (k_{2r} + k_3) = \\left[ (k_{1r} + k_{1f} P_A)(k_{2r} + k_3) + k_3 k_{2f} P_B + k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B \\right] \\theta_A $$\nSolving for the steady-state coverage $\\theta_A^{ss}$:\n$$ \\theta_A^{ss} = \\frac{k_{1f} P_A (k_{2r} + k_3)}{(k_{1r} + k_{1f} P_A)(k_{2r} + k_3) + k_3 k_{2f} P_B + k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B} $$\nUsing equation ($4$), we find $\\theta_I^{ss}$:\n$$ \\theta_I^{ss} = \\frac{k_{2f} P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3} \\theta_A^{ss} = \\frac{k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B}{(k_{1r} + k_{1f} P_A)(k_{2r} + k_3) + k_3 k_{2f} P_B + k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B} $$\nThe exact steady-state rate of production is $r_{\\mathrm{full}} = k_3 \\theta_I^{ss}$, which gives:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{full}} = \\frac{k_3 k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B}{(k_{1r} + k_{1f} P_A)(k_{2r} + k_3) + k_3 k_{2f} P_B + k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B} $$\n\n### Derivation of the Reduced Rate Expression ($r_{\\mathrm{red}}$)\n\nThis derivation applies two standard approximations.\n1.  **Quasi-Equilibrium (QE) Approximation for Step (1):** $A(g) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$.\nThis approximation assumes the forward and reverse rates of step ($1$) are much larger than the rates of all other steps, causing step ($1$) to be in a state of near-equilibrium. The net rate of step ($1$) is thus considered to be zero.\n$$ r_1 = k_{1f} P_A \\theta_* - k_{1r} \\theta_A \\approx 0 \\implies k_{1f} P_A \\theta_* \\approx k_{1r} \\theta_A $$\nThis yields an expression for $\\theta_A$ in terms of $\\theta_*$, where $K_1 = k_{1f}/k_{1r}$ is the adsorption equilibrium constant:\n$$ \\theta_A \\approx \\frac{k_{1f}}{k_{1r}} P_A \\theta_* = K_1 P_A \\theta_* \\quad (6) $$\n2.  **Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) for Intermediate $I*$**:\nThis approximation assumes the concentration of the reactive intermediate $I*$ is low and changes slowly with time, so $d\\theta_I/dt \\approx 0$.\n$$ k_{2f} P_B \\theta_A - (k_{2r} + k_3) \\theta_I \\approx 0 \\implies \\theta_I \\approx \\left( \\frac{k_{2f} P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3} \\right) \\theta_A \\quad (7) $$\nWe use the site balance $\\theta_* + \\theta_A + \\theta_I = 1$ to solve for the coverages. Substitute expressions for $\\theta_A$ (from $6$) and $\\theta_I$ (from $7$) into the site balance, expressing all coverages in terms of $\\theta_*$:\n$$ \\theta_* + (K_1 P_A \\theta_*) + \\left( \\frac{k_{2f} P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3} \\right) (K_1 P_A \\theta_*) = 1 $$\nSolving for $\\theta_*$:\n$$ \\theta_* \\left( 1 + K_1 P_A + \\frac{k_{2f} K_1 P_A P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3} \\right) = 1 \\implies \\theta_* \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + K_1 P_A + \\frac{k_{2f} K_1 P_A P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3}} $$\nThe rate of production is $r_{\\mathrm{red}} = k_3 \\theta_I^{\\mathrm{approx}}$. We find $\\theta_I^{\\mathrm{approx}}$ by combining equations ($6$) and ($7$) and substituting the expression for $\\theta_*$:\n$$ \\theta_I^{\\mathrm{approx}} \\approx \\left(\\frac{k_{2f} K_1 P_A P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3}\\right) \\theta_* \\approx \\frac{\\frac{k_{2f} K_1 P_A P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3}}{1 + K_1 P_A + \\frac{k_{2f} K_1 P_A P_B}{k_{2r} + k_3}} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $k_{2r} + k_3$:\n$$ \\theta_I^{\\mathrm{approx}} \\approx \\frac{k_{2f} K_1 P_A P_B}{(k_{2r} + k_3)(1 + K_1 P_A) + k_{2f} K_1 P_A P_B} $$\nSubstitute $K_1 = k_{1f}/k_{1r}$:\n$$ \\theta_I^{\\mathrm{approx}} \\approx \\frac{k_{2f} (k_{1f}/k_{1r}) P_A P_B}{(k_{2r} + k_3)(1 + (k_{1f}/k_{1r}) P_A) + k_{2f} (k_{1f}/k_{1r}) P_A P_B} $$\nMultiply the numerator and denominator by $k_{1r}$:\n$$ \\theta_I^{\\mathrm{approx}} \\approx \\frac{k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B}{(k_{2r} + k_3)(k_{1r} + k_{1f} P_A) + k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B} $$\nThe reduced rate expression is then $r_{\\mathrm{red}} = k_3 \\theta_I^{\\mathrm{approx}}$:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{red}} = \\frac{k_3 k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B}{(k_{1r} + k_{1f} P_A)(k_{2r} + k_3) + k_{1f} k_{2f} P_A P_B} $$\nThe final task is to implement these two expressions for $r_{\\mathrm{full}}$ and $r_{\\mathrm{red}}$ to calculate the absolute relative error $E = \\lvert r_{\\mathrm{red}} - r_{\\mathrm{full}} \\rvert / r_{\\mathrm{full}}$ for the given test cases.",
