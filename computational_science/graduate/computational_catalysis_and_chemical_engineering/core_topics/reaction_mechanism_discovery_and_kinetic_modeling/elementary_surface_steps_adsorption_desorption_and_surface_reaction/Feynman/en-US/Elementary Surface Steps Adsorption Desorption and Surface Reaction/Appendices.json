            "introduction": "The Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism is a cornerstone for modeling reactions between co-adsorbed species on a catalyst surface. While its final rate expression is widely used, a deeper understanding comes from deriving it from first principles. This practice challenges you to build the LH model from its elementary steps, focusing on how competitive adsorption affects the surface coverage of reactants and, consequently, the overall reaction rate . By deriving the expressions for apparent reaction orders, you will uncover how these kinetic parameters are not fixed constants but rather dynamic functions of pressure and temperature, a crucial insight that distinguishes surface catalysis from simple gas-phase kinetics.",

            "problem": "Consider a binary Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism for a catalytic surface reaction involving two gas-phase species $A$ and $B$ that adsorb competitively on the same type of surface site and react via an elementary bimolecular surface reaction. Assume the following elementary steps and modeling assumptions hold: (i) non-dissociative adsorption of $A$ and $B$ obeys mass-action kinetics, (ii) adsorption and desorption of each species reach quasi-equilibrium with well-defined adsorption equilibrium constants, (iii) one site per adsorbate and no lateral interactions (ideal mean-field Langmuir model), (iv) a single type of uniform surface site, (v) the site balance enforces conservation of fractional coverage, and (vi) the surface reaction between adsorbed $A$ and $B$ is elementary and irreversible.\n\nYou are to derive and implement the reaction orders with respect to the partial pressures $p_A$ and $p_B$ for the rate of product formation, based on first principles. Start from the fundamental base consisting of mass-action kinetics for elementary surface steps, quasi-equilibrium for adsorption/desorption, and the Langmuir site balance. Do not begin from any pre-specified rate expression.

            "solution": "The user has provided a valid problem statement in the domain of chemical engineering and heterogeneous catalysis. The problem asks for the derivation and implementation of expressions for the reaction orders of a binary Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) catalytic reaction. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters are provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from fundamental principles as requested. Let $*$ denote a vacant surface site, $A(g)$ and $B(g)$ the gas-phase reactants, and $A*$ and $B*$ the corresponding adsorbed species.\n\n**1. Derivation of Surface Coverages and Reaction Rate**\n\nThe elementary steps for the process are:\n1.  Reversible, non-dissociative adsorption of species $A$: $A(g) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$\n2.  Reversible, non-dissociative adsorption of species $B$: $B(g) + * \\rightleftharpoons B*$\n3.  Irreversible, elementary surface reaction: $A* + B* \\rightarrow \\text{Products} + 2*$\n\nLet $\\theta_A$, $\\theta_B$, and $\\theta_v$ be the fractional surface coverages of species $A$, species $B$, and vacant sites, respectively.\n\nUnder the quasi-equilibrium assumption for adsorption (steps 1 and 2), the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption for each species. For species $A$, this is expressed as:\n$$r_{ad,A} = r_{des,A}$$\nUsing mass-action kinetics, where the rate of adsorption is proportional to the partial pressure $p_A$ and the fraction of vacant sites $\\theta_v$, and the rate of desorption is proportional to the fraction of adsorbed sites $\\theta_A$:\n$$k_{ad,A} p_A \\theta_v = k_{des,A} \\theta_A$$\nRearranging this gives an expression for $\\theta_A$:\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{k_{ad,A}}{k_{des,A}} p_A \\theta_v = K_A(T) p_A \\theta_v$$\nwhere $K_A(T) = k_{ad,A}/k_{des,A}$ is the temperature-dependent adsorption equilibrium constant for species $A$.\n\nBy an identical argument for species $B$:\n$$\\theta_B = K_B(T) p_B \\theta_v$$\nwhere $K_B(T)$ is the adsorption equilibrium constant for species $B$.\n\nThe Langmuir model assumes a fixed number of total sites. The site balance equation states that the sum of all fractional coverages must be unity:\n$$\\theta_A + \\theta_B + \\theta_v = 1$$\nWe can now solve for the coverages by substituting the equilibrium expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ into the site balance equation:\n$$K_A(T) p_A \\theta_v + K_B(T) p_B \\theta_v + \\theta_v = 1$$\nFactoring out $\\theta_v$:\n$$\\theta_v(1 + K_A(T) p_A + K_B(T) p_B) = 1$$\nThis yields the expression for the fraction of vacant sites:\n$$\\theta_v = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A(T) p_A + K_B(T) p_B}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\theta_v$ back into the equations for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$, we obtain the final expressions for the surface coverages:\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{K_A(T) p_A}{1 + K_A(T) p_A + K_B(T) p_B}$$\n$$\\theta_B = \\frac{K_B(T) p_B}{1 + K_A(T) p_A + K_B(T) p_B}$$\n\nThe surface reaction step, $A* + B* \\rightarrow \\text{Products}$, is stated to be elementary and irreversible. The rate of this reaction, $r$, is therefore given by the law of mass action applied to the surface species:\n$$r = k_s(T) \\theta_A \\theta_B$$\nwhere $k_s(T)$ is the surface reaction rate constant. Substituting the derived expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ gives the full rate law:\n$$r(p_A, p_B, T) = k_s(T) \\frac{K_A(T) p_A}{(1 + K_A(T) p_A + K_B(T) p_B)} \\frac{K_B(T) p_B}{(1 + K_A(T) p_A + K_B(T) p_B)}$$\n$$r = \\frac{k_s(T) K_A(T) K_B(T) p_A p_B}{(1 + K_A(T) p_A + K_B(T) p_B)^2}$$\nThis is the Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate expression for a bimolecular reaction between two competitively adsorbed species.\n\n**2. Derivation of Reaction Orders**\n\nThe reaction order with respect to a species is defined as the logarithmic derivative of the rate with respect to its partial pressure. For species $A$, the reaction order $n_A$ is:\n$$n_A = \\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial \\ln p_A} \\equiv \\frac{p_A}{r} \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial p_A}$$\nTo derive the expression for $n_A$, we first take the natural logarithm of the rate expression $r$:\n$$\\ln r = \\ln(k_s(T) K_A(T) K_B(T)) + \\ln p_A + \\ln p_B - 2 \\ln(1 + K_A(T) p_A + K_B(T) p_B)$$\nNow, we differentiate $\\ln r$ with respect to $p_A$, holding $p_B$ and $T$ constant. The terms $k_s(T)$, $K_A(T)$, and $K_B(T)$ are constant with respect to pressure.\n$$\\frac{\\partial (\\ln r)}{\\partial p_A} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_A} \\left[ \\ln p_A - 2 \\ln(1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial (\\ln r)}{\\partial p_A} = \\frac{1}{p_A} - 2 \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p_A}(1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial (\\ln r)}{\\partial p_A} = \\frac{1}{p_A} - \\frac{2 K_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\nUsing the chain rule definition $n_A = \\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial \\ln p_A} = p_A\\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial p_A}$:\n$$n_A = p_A \\left( \\frac{1}{p_A} - \\frac{2 K_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\right)$$\n$$n_A = 1 - \\frac{2 K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\nThis is the final expression for the reaction order with respect to species $A$.\n\nThe derivation for $n_B$ is symmetrical:\n$$n_B = \\frac{\\partial \\ln r}{\\partial \\ln p_B}$$\nDifferentiating $\\ln r$ with respect to $p_B$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial (\\ln r)}{\\partial p_B} = \\frac{1}{p_B} - \\frac{2 K_B}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\nMultiplying by $p_B$:\n$$n_B = p_B \\left( \\frac{1}{p_B} - \\frac{2 K_B}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\right)$$\n$$n_B = 1 - \\frac{2 K_B p_B}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\n\n**3. Implementation Plan**\nThe derived expressions will be implemented in a Python program. The program will first define the given physical constants. Then, for each test case $(p_A, p_B, T)$:\na. It will compute the temperature-dependent adsorption constants $K_A(T)$ and $K_B(T)$ using the provided van't Hoff equation:\n   $$K_i(T) = K_{i,\\mathrm{ref}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta H_i}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}-\\frac{1}{T}\\right)\\right)$$\nb. It will then compute the denominator term $D = 1 + K_A(T) p_A + K_B(T) p_B$.\nc. Finally, it will calculate $n_A = 1 - 2 K_A(T) p_A / D$ and $n_B = 1 - 2 K_B(T) p_B / D$.\nd. The results for each test case, rounded to six decimal places, will be collected and formatted into the required output string. The special case where a reactant partial pressure is zero, as in test case $4$ ($p_B=0.0$), is handled correctly by the derived formulae, yielding $n_B=1$.",

            "problem": "A Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) experiment heats a catalytic surface linearly in time according to $T(t) = T_0 + \\beta t$, with constant heating rate $\\beta > 0$. Consider a diatomic product that can desorb by two distinct microscopic mechanisms: (i) molecular desorption of a preformed diatomic adsorbate, which is first order in the surface coverage, and (ii) associative (recombinative) desorption of two adsorbed atoms to form the diatomic gas-phase molecule, which is second order in coverage. Let the surface coverage be $\\theta$, and assume the Polanyi–Wigner rate law $r(T) = \\nu \\theta^{n} \\exp\\!\\big(-E/(k_B T)\\big)$ with $n = 1$ for molecular desorption and $n = 2$ for associative desorption.

The coverage evolves via the continuity equation $d\\theta/dt = -r(T)$.\n\nStarting strictly from these bases and using only physically justified approximations, derive the maximum-rate (peak) condition and obtain closed-form analytic expressions for the peak temperature $T_p$ in both the first-order and second-order cases.

The concepts of Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD), the Polanyi-Wigner rate law, and the use of approximations like the leading-edge analysis are standard in the fields of surface science and chemical kinetics. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe desorption rate, $r$, is given by the Polanyi–Wigner equation:\n$$r(t) = \\nu \\theta(t)^n \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T(t)}\\right)$$\nThe rate is a function of time $t$ through the time-dependent coverage $\\theta(t)$ and temperature $T(t)$. The peak temperature, $T_p$, corresponds to the temperature at which the desorption rate is maximum. To find this maximum, we set the time derivative of the rate to zero: $\\frac{dr}{dt} = 0$.

We start by integrating the rate law:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = -\\nu \\theta^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nUsing $dt = \\frac{dT}{\\beta}$, we separate variables and integrate from the start of the experiment ($T_0, \\theta_0$) to the peak ($T_p, \\theta_p$):\n$$\\int_{\\theta_0}^{\\theta_p} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\theta^2} = -\\frac{\\nu}{\\beta} \\int_{T_0}^{T_p} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dT$$\n$$\\left[-\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right]_{\\theta_0}^{\\theta_p} = -\\frac{1}{\\theta_p} + \\frac{1}{\\theta_0} = -\\frac{\\nu}{\\beta} \\int_{T_0}^{T_p} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dT$$\nThe strong temperature dependence of the Arrhenius factor justifies approximating the integral (especially since $E \\gg k_B T$ and desorption is negligible at $T_0$):\n$$\\int_{T_0}^{T_p} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T}\\right) dT \\approx \\frac{k_B T_p^2}{E} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_p}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this approximation back into the integrated rate equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} - \\frac{1}{\\theta_p} \\approx -\\frac{\\nu}{\\beta} \\frac{k_B T_p^2}{E} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_p}\\right)$$\nFrom the peak condition for $n=2$, we can write $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_p}\\right) = \\frac{E\\beta}{2\\nu\\theta_p k_B T_p^2}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} - \\frac{1}{\\theta_p} \\approx -\\frac{\\nu k_B T_p^2}{\\beta E} \\left(\\frac{E\\beta}{2\\nu\\theta_p k_B T_p^2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2\\theta_p}$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\theta_p$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\theta_0} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\theta_p} - \\frac{1}{2\\theta_p} = \\frac{1}{2\\theta_p} \\implies \\theta_p \\approx \\frac{\\theta_0}{2}$$\nThis standard result states that for a second-order process, the peak maximum occurs when half the initial adsorbate has desorbed.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing all necessary information for a unique solution without contradictions or ambiguities. It describes a standard and fundamental task in computational chemical kinetics: ensuring that the rate constants in a microkinetic model are consistent with the underlying thermodynamics of the elementary steps. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between thermodynamics and kinetics for an elementary reversible reaction. This relationship is enforced by the principle of detailed balance, which states that at equilibrium, the rate of every elementary process is equal to the rate of its reverse process. For a simple reversible step, this implies that the ratio of the forward rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{f}}$, to the reverse rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$, must be equal to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{f}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}}} = K_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\n\nThe solution requires us to compute both $k_{\\mathrm{f}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$ using Transition State Theory (TST) in a way that respects this condition.\n\nFirst, the equilibrium constant, $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, is related to the standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $R$ is the universal gas constant ($8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$) and $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nSecond, according to Transition State Theory (specifically, the Eyring equation), the rate constant, $k$, for an elementary step is given by:\n\n$$\nk = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn this expression, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant ($1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$), $h$ is Planck's constant ($6.62607015 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s}$), and $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ is the molar Gibbs free energy of activation. The transmission coefficient is assumed to be unity, a common practice for elementary steps on surfaces unless quantum tunneling is significant. The units of the pre-exponential factor $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h}$ are $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, consistent with the required output units for the rate constants.\n\nApplying the TST expression to the forward and reverse reactions, we have:\n\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}$ and $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}$ are the activation free energies for the forward and reverse directions, respectively.\n\nTo enforce thermodynamic consistency, we substitute these expressions into the detailed balance condition:\n\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{f}}}{k_{\\mathrm{r}}} = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT}\\right)}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}}{RT}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}} - \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\nSetting this equal to the thermodynamic expression for $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}} - \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we obtain the relationship between the activation energies and the overall reaction energy:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}} - \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}} = -\\Delta G^\\circ\n$$\n\nThis can be rearranged to express the reverse activation energy in terms of the given forward activation energy and the Gibbs free energy change:\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\Delta G^\\circ\n$$\n\nThis equation is the key to ensuring thermodynamic consistency. It demonstrates that if the forward activation energy and the reaction energy are known, the reverse activation energy is uniquely determined.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Take the input parameters: temperature $T$, standard Gibbs free energy change $\\Delta G^\\circ$, and forward activation free energy $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\n2.  Convert the energy values from $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ by multiplying by $1000$.\n3.  Calculate the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ}{RT})$.\n4.  Calculate the forward rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{f}}$, using its TST expression with $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\n5.  Calculate the reverse activation free energy, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}} = \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\Delta G^\\circ$.\n6.  Calculate the reverse rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$, using its TST expression with the derived $\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}}$.\n7.  Compute the ratio of the calculated rate constants, $(k_{\\mathrm{f}}/k_{\\mathrm{r}})_{\\text{model}} = k_{\\mathrm{f}}/k_{\\mathrm{r}}$.\n8.  Finally, calculate the absolute relative deviation to verify consistency: $\\left|\\dfrac{(k_{\\mathrm{f}}/k_{\\mathrm{r}})_{\\text{model}}}{K_{\\mathrm{eq}}} - 1\\right|$.\n\nBy construction, the ratio $(k_{\\mathrm{f}}/k_{\\mathrm{r}})_{\\text{model}}$ will be mathematically identical to $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\n(k_{\\mathrm{f}}/k_{\\mathrm{r}})_{\\text{model}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{r}} - \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{(\\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\Delta G^\\circ) - \\Delta G^\\ddagger_{\\mathrm{f}}}{RT}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ}{RT}\\right) = K_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n$$\nTherefore, the absolute relative deviation should be zero, or a very small number attributable to floating-point precision limitations in the computer's arithmetic. This calculation serves as an excellent internal consistency check on the implementation.",
