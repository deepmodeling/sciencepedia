            "problem": "In computational catalysis and chemical engineering, local characterization of adsorption-site stability on a Potential Energy Surface (PES) is often conducted by vibrational frequency analysis of a quadratic expansion of the potential about a stationary point. Consider a two-dimensional approximation to the PES near a stationary point written in nondimensionalized coordinates as the scalar potential $V(x,y)=x^{2}+xy+2y^{2}$, where $x$ and $y$ are dimensionless mass-weighted internal coordinates and $V$ is nondimensionalized energy. The origin $(x,y)=(0,0)$ is a stationary point candidate obtained, for instance, from a geometry optimization using Density Functional Theory (DFT).\n\nStarting from first principles of stationary point characterization and the definition of the curvature matrix, compute the Hessian matrix $H$ of $V$ at the origin, determine its eigenvalues, and use them to assess positive definiteness. Conclude whether the origin is a local minimum by testing positive definiteness via the eigenvalues. Provide your final answer as the two exact eigenvalues of $H$ in a single row, expressed in closed form without numerical rounding. Since the potential and coordinates are nondimensionalized, no physical units should be reported.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the characterization of a stationary point on a two-dimensional Potential Energy Surface (PES) by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. The potential is given by the function $V(x,y) = x^{2} + xy + 2y^{2}$. The point to be characterized is the origin, $(x,y) = (0,0)$.\n\nAccording to the principles of multivariable calculus, a stationary point of a twice-differentiable scalar function is a point where the gradient of the function is zero. The nature of this stationary point (local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point) is determined by the definiteness of the Hessian matrix, which is the matrix of second partial derivatives, evaluated at that point. Specifically, a stationary point is a local minimum if and only if its Hessian matrix is positive definite. A symmetric matrix is positive definite if all of its eigenvalues are strictly positive.\n\nFirst, we must verify that the origin, $(x,y) = (0,0)$, is indeed a stationary point of $V(x,y)$. We compute the gradient of $V$, denoted as $\\nabla V$. The components of the gradient are the first partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^{2} + xy + 2y^{2}) = 2x + y $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^{2} + xy + 2y^{2}) = x + 4y $$\nThe gradient vector is $\\nabla V(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2x + y \\\\ x + 4y \\end{pmatrix}$.\nEvaluating the gradient at the origin $(0,0)$:\n$$ \\nabla V(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(0) + 0 \\\\ 0 + 4(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince the gradient is the zero vector at the origin, $(0,0)$ is confirmed to be a stationary point.\n\nNext, we compute the Hessian matrix, $H$, of the potential $V(x,y)$. The elements of the Hessian matrix, $H_{ij}$, are the second partial derivatives, $H_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}$. For our two-dimensional case with coordinates $x$ and $y$:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}}  \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y \\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the required second partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2x + y) = 2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x + 4y) = 4 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x + 4y) = 1 $$\nSince $V$ is a polynomial function, it is continuously differentiable to any order, meaning the mixed partial derivatives are equal (Clairaut's theorem), so $\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 1$.\nThe Hessian matrix is therefore:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 1  4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSince all second partial derivatives are constants, the Hessian matrix is constant for all $(x,y)$, including the origin.\n\nTo determine if this matrix is positive definite, we compute its eigenvalues, denoted by $\\lambda$. The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic equation, $\\det(H - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 - \\lambda  1 \\\\ 1  4 - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\nExpanding the determinant gives the characteristic polynomial:\n$$ (2 - \\lambda)(4 - \\lambda) - (1)(1) = 0 $$\n$$ 8 - 4\\lambda - 2\\lambda + \\lambda^{2} - 1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^{2} - 6\\lambda + 7 = 0 $$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $\\lambda$ using the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-6$, and $c=7$.\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-(-6) \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^{2} - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 28}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} $$\nSince $\\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, we have:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda = 3 \\pm \\sqrt{2} $$\nThe two eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix $H$ are:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = 3 - \\sqrt{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = 3 + \\sqrt{2} $$\n\nFinally, we test for positive definiteness by examining the signs of the eigenvalues.\nWe know that $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$.\n$$ \\lambda_1 = 3 - \\sqrt{2} \\approx 3 - 1.414 = 1.586  0 $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = 3 + \\sqrt{2} \\approx 3 + 1.414 = 4.414  0 $$\nSince both eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, are strictly positive, the Hessian matrix $H$ is positive definite.\nA stationary point where the Hessian is positive definite is a local minimum.

            "solution": "The problem requires a complete vibrational analysis of the stationary points on the potential energy surface (PES) given by $V(x,y) = x^{4} + y^{2} - 2x^{2}$. The analysis proceeds in four steps as requested.\n\n1) **Location of Stationary Points**\n\nA stationary point $(x_0, y_0)$ on the PES is a point where the gradient of the potential energy is zero. The gradient of $V(x,y)$ is given by $\\nabla V = \\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} \\right)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the partial derivatives of $V(x,y)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^{4} + y^{2} - 2x^{2}) = 4x^{3} - 4x $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(x^{4} + y^{2} - 2x^{2}) = 2y $$\n\nNext, we set these partial derivatives equal to zero to find the coordinates of the stationary points:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = 4x^{3} - 4x = 4x(x^{2} - 1) = 4x(x-1)(x+1) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = 2y = 0 $$\n\nThe first equation gives solutions $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$. The second equation gives the solution $y=0$. Combining these, we find three stationary points on the PES:\n$P_1 = (0,0)$\n$P_2 = (1,0)$\n$P_3 = (-1,0)$\n\n2) **Hessian Matrix, Eigenvalues, and Classification**\n\nThe nature of a stationary point is determined by the local curvature of the PES, which is described by the Hessian matrix, $H$. The Hessian is the matrix of second partial derivatives:\n$$ H = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}}  \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x \\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y \\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y^{2}} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nWe compute the second partial derivatives of $V(x,y)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(4x^{3} - 4x) = 12x^{2} - 4 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(2y) = 2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x \\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(2y) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial y \\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(4x^{3} - 4x) = 0 $$\n\nThe Hessian matrix as a function of $(x,y)$ is:\n$$ H(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12x^{2} - 4  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Hessian at each stationary point. Since the Hessian is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvalues ($\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$) are its diagonal elements.\n\n**At point $P_1 = (0,0)$:**\n$$ H(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12(0)^{2} - 4  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -4$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since one eigenvalue is negative and one is positive, the point $(0,0)$ is a **first-order saddle point** (also known as a transition state).\n\n**At point $P_2 = (1,0)$:**\n$$ H(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12(1)^{2} - 4  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 8$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the point $(1,0)$ is a **local minimum**.\n\n**At point $P_3 = (-1,0)$:**\n$$ H(-1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12(-1)^{2} - 4  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 8$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the point $(-1,0)$ is also a **local minimum**.\n\n3) **Normal Mode Angular Frequencies**\n\nFor small oscillations around a stationary point, the system's dynamics are governed by a linearization of Newton's second law. Let $\\boldsymbol{q} = (x,y)$ be the coordinate vector and $\\boldsymbol{\\eta} = \\boldsymbol{q} - \\boldsymbol{q}_0$ be the displacement from a stationary point $\\boldsymbol{q}_0$. The equations of motion are $m \\ddot{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}} = -\\nabla V$. For small displacements, the force can be approximated as $-\\nabla V \\approx -H \\boldsymbol{\\eta}$, where $H$ is the Hessian evaluated at $\\boldsymbol{q}_0$. We assume the same mass $m$ for both degrees of freedom, giving the matrix equation $m\\ddot{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}} + H\\boldsymbol{\\eta} = 0$.\n\nWe seek solutions of the form $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}(t) = \\boldsymbol{\\eta}_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. Substituting this into the equation of motion yields:\n$$ m(-\\omega^{2})\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_0 \\exp(i\\omega t) + H\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_0 \\exp(i\\omega t) = 0 $$\n$$ (H - m\\omega^{2}I)\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_0 = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the matrix must be zero: $\\det(H - m\\omega^{2}I) = 0$. This implies that the values of $m\\omega^{2}$ are the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the Hessian matrix $H$. Thus, for each eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$, there is a corresponding squared angular frequency $\\omega_i^2 = \\lambda_i / m$, which gives $\\omega_i = \\sqrt{\\lambda_i/m}$.\n\n**Frequencies at $P_1 = (0,0)$ (Saddle Point):**\nEigenvalues: $\\lambda_1 = -4$, $\\lambda_2 = 2$.\n$$ \\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{-4}{m}} = i\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{m}} $$\n$$ \\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}} $$\nThe presence of an imaginary angular frequency $\\omega_1$ indicates that this mode is not oscillatory. An imaginary frequency $\\omega = i\\nu$ (where $\\nu$ is real and positive) corresponds to solutions of the form $\\exp(\\pm \\nu t)$, representing exponential decay from or growth away from the saddle point. This instability is characteristic of a maximum in the potential energy along the corresponding normal coordinate (the reaction coordinate). The mode with imaginary frequency defines the pathway for the reaction over the transition state barrier.\n\n**Frequencies at $P_2 = (1,0)$ and $P_3 = (-1,0)$ (Minima):**\nEigenvalues: $\\lambda_1 = 8$, $\\lambda_2 = 2$.\n$$ \\omega_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{m}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}} $$\n$$ \\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}} $$\nBoth angular frequencies are real, corresponding to stable, bounded harmonic oscillations about the potential energy minimum.\n\n4) **Calculation of the Ratio $R$**\n\nThe dimensionless ratio $R$ is defined as the magnitude of the imaginary angular frequency at the first-order saddle point divided by the smaller of the two real angular frequencies at either minimum.\n\nThe saddle point is $(0,0)$. The imaginary angular frequency is $\\omega_{imag} = i\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{m}}$. Its magnitude is:\n$$ |\\omega_{imag}| = \\left| i\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{m}} \\right| = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{m}} $$\n\nThe minima are at $(\\pm 1,0)$. The two real angular frequencies at these points are $\\omega_{min,1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{m}}$ and $\\omega_{min,2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}}$.\nThe smaller of these two frequencies is:\n$$ \\omega_{small} = \\omega_{min,2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}} $$\n\nNow, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{|\\omega_{imag}|}{\\omega_{small}} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{m}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}}} = \\frac{2/\\sqrt{m}}{\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{m}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nSimplifying the expression for $R$:\n$$ R = \\sqrt{2} $$\nThe parameter $m$ cancels out, making the ratio $R$ independent of the mass.",

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Context**: A transition state search for a heterogeneous catalytic reaction.\n- **System**: An adsorbed nonlinear intermediate on a metal slab.\n- **Computation**: The mass-weighted Hessian matrix was computed.\n- **Coordinate System**: The analysis was performed in an active internal-coordinate subspace.\n- **Subspace Dimensionality**: The diagonalization was carried out in a reduced, $7$-dimensional subspace.\n- **Constraints**: Redundant internal coordinates and constraints were used to keep the slab rigid.\n- **Data**: The eigenvalues of the mass-weighted Hessian are given as $\\{\\lambda_i\\}=\\{0,0,0,0.5,0.7,1.2,-0.1\\}$ in atomic units.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem describes a standard scenario in computational chemistry and catalysis for characterizing points on a potential energy surface (PES).\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The methodology is sound. The characterization of a stationary point on a PES by diagonalizing the Hessian matrix (specifically, the mass-weighted Hessian to obtain normal-mode frequencies) is a fundamental technique. Positive eigenvalues correspond to stable vibrational modes, while negative eigenvalues correspond to unstable modes (imaginary frequencies). The concept of a transition state (a first-order saddle point) having exactly one negative eigenvalue is a cornerstone of transition state theory. The use of a constrained, reduced-dimensional active subspace for computational efficiency in complex systems (like an adsorbate on a surface) is also a common and valid practice.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a complete set of eigenvalues for the specified subspace, along with sufficient context to interpret them.

It contains no contradictions or ambiguities. It represents a valid and standard problem in the field of computational chemistry.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe local topology of a potential energy surface $V$ around a stationary point $\\mathbf{q}_0$ (where the gradient $\\nabla V = \\mathbf{0}$) is determined by the second-order term in its Taylor expansion. In mass-weighted coordinates $\\mathbf{q}$, this is given by:\n$$ V(\\mathbf{q}) \\approx V(\\mathbf{q}_0) + \\frac{1}{2} (\\mathbf{q}-\\mathbf{q}_0)^T \\mathbf{H}^m (\\mathbf{q}-\\mathbf{q}_0) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{H}^m$ is the mass-weighted Hessian matrix. The eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ of $\\mathbf{H}^m$ determine the curvature of the PES along the directions of the corresponding eigenvectors (the normal modes).\n\nThe relationship between the eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ and the angular frequency $\\omega_i$ of a normal mode is:\n$\\lambda_i = \\omega_i^2$\nFrom this, we can classify the nature of each mode:\n1.  **If $\\lambda_i  0$**: The frequency $\\omega_i = \\sqrt{\\lambda_i}$ is real and positive. The potential energy increases quadratically along this direction. This corresponds to a stable, harmonic vibration.\n2.  **If $\\lambda_i  0$**: The frequency $\\omega_i = \\sqrt{\\lambda_i} = i\\sqrt{|\\lambda_i|}$ is imaginary. The potential energy *decreases* quadratically along this direction. This corresponds to an unstable mode, indicating a maximum along that coordinate.\n3.  **If $\\lambda_i = 0$**: The frequency is zero. This corresponds to a direction along which the potential energy is locally flat (to second order). In a full-system calculation of an isolated molecule, these typically correspond to the $3$ overall translations and $3$ overall rotations ($2$ for a linear molecule). In a constrained or subspace calculation, as described here, zero eigenvalues can also arise from the constraints themselves (e.g., motion within a frozen slab), redundancies in the chosen coordinate system, or directions effectively projected out of the active space.\n\nThe stationary point is classified by its *index*, which is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian.\n-   Index $0$ (all non-zero $\\lambda_i  0$): Local minimum.\n-   Index $1$ (one $\\lambda_i  0$): First-order saddle point (a transition state).\n-   Index $N  1$ ($N$ eigenvalues $\\lambda_i  0$): $N$-th order saddle point.\n\nLet us analyze the given set of eigenvalues for the $7$-dimensional subspace: $\\{\\lambda_i\\} = \\{0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0.7, 1.2, -0.1\\}$.\n-   **Positive Eigenvalues**: There are three positive eigenvalues: $0.5$, $0.7$, and $1.2$. These correspond to $3$ stable vibrational modes within the active subspace.\n-   **Negative Eigenvalues**: There is exactly one negative eigenvalue: $-0.1$. This indicates exactly one unstable direction.\n-   **Zero Eigenvalues**: There are three zero eigenvalues: $0$, $0$, and $0$. As established, these are expected consequences of using a constrained, reduced-dimensional subspace and do not affect the index of the stationary point.\n\nSince there is exactly one negative eigenvalue, the index of the stationary point is $1$. Therefore, this point is a first-order saddle point, which corresponds to a transition state.

The provided set has only three.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. The point is a first-order saddle (a transition state) in the $7$-dimensional active subspace; the unstable direction is along the eigenvector associated with $\\lambda=-0.1$, and the zero eigenvalues arise from rigid or redundant coordinates that do not change the index.**\n-   This statement correctly identifies the point as a first-order saddle (transition state) because there is exactly one negative eigenvalue.\n-   It correctly identifies the unstable direction as being associated with the negative eigenvalue, $\\lambda=-0.1$.\n-   It provides a correct physical and computational interpretation of the zero eigenvalues in this context: they are artifacts of the calculation setup (constraints, redundancies) and do not alter the classification of the saddle point, which is determined by the number of negative eigenvalues (the index).\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. The point is a second-order saddle; the system is unstable along two directions corresponding to $\\lambda=-0.1$ and $\\lambda=0.5$, and the zero eigenvalues indicate the optimizer failed to converge.**\n-   This statement claims the point is a second-order saddle. This is **Incorrect**. A second-order saddle would require two negative eigenvalues. There is only one.\n-   It incorrectly claims that the direction associated with $\\lambda=0.5$ is unstable. Since this eigenvalue is positive, it corresponds to a stable vibrational mode.\n-   The claim that zero eigenvalues indicate a failed convergence is generally false. A stationary point is defined by a zero gradient. Zero Hessian eigenvalues at such a point are physically and computationally meaningful, as explained above, and do not imply the gradient is non-zero.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. This is not a stationary point because the Hessian has zero eigenvalues; a true stationary point must have a Hessian that is strictly positive or strictly negative definite with no zeros.**\n-   This statement presents a fundamentally flawed definition. A stationary point is a point where the gradient of the potential energy is zero. The Hessian's eigenspectrum *classifies* the type of stationary point (minimum, maximum, or saddle point of various orders).\n-   The existence of zero eigenvalues does not invalidate a point as a stationary point. For any isolated molecule in vacuum, the Hessian will have at least $5$ or $6$ zero eigenvalues corresponding to translation and rotation.\n-   The claim that a \"true\" stationary point's Hessian must be strictly positive or negative definite is false; this only describes a non-degenerate local minimum or maximum, respectively, and completely excludes the entire class of saddle points (transition states).\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.",
