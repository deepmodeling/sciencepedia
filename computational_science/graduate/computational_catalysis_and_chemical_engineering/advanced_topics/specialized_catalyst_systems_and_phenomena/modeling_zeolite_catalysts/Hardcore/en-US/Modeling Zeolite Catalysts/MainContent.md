## Introduction
Zeolite catalysts are cornerstone materials in the chemical and petrochemical industries, valued for their unique porous structures and tunable acidity. Understanding how their atomic-scale features translate into macroscopic catalytic performance is a central challenge in catalysis research. While experimental techniques provide valuable macroscopic data, they often struggle to resolve the intricate details of [reaction mechanisms](@entry_id:149504) within the confined zeolite pores. Computational modeling has emerged as an indispensable tool to bridge this gap, offering a molecular-level lens to decipher the complex interplay of structure, energetics, and kinetics.

This article provides a graduate-level guide to the theory and practice of modeling zeolite catalysts. We will navigate the multi-scale modeling hierarchy, starting from the ground up. In the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, you will learn the foundational concepts for representing zeolite frameworks, modeling active sites, calculating accurate [reaction energetics](@entry_id:142634) with methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT), and mapping reaction pathways. Building on this foundation, the second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, explores how these models are applied to understand complex phenomena such as [shape selectivity](@entry_id:152121), transport limitations, and [catalyst deactivation](@entry_id:152780), highlighting the crucial links to [chemical engineering](@entry_id:143883), materials science, and experimental validation. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will provide opportunities to apply these theoretical concepts to solve practical computational problems.

Our journey begins by establishing the digital bedrock of any simulation: the accurate representation of the zeolite's crystalline structure and its catalytically [active sites](@entry_id:152165).

## Principles and Mechanisms

The accurate computational modeling of zeolite catalysts hinges on a multi-scale approach, progressing from the precise digital representation of the crystalline framework to the simulation of complex [reaction networks](@entry_id:203526). This chapter elucidates the core principles and mechanisms underpinning this hierarchy of models. We begin by establishing the methods for representing zeolite structures and their [active sites](@entry_id:152165). Subsequently, we delve into the quantum mechanical treatment of adsorbate-framework interactions and reaction pathways. Finally, we connect these microscopic events to macroscopic kinetics through the formalism of [microkinetic modeling](@entry_id:175129).

### Representing the Crystalline Framework

The foundation of any computational model of a zeolite is a robust and accurate representation of its atomic structure. Zeolites are crystalline [aluminosilicates](@entry_id:151974), and their defining characteristic is a three-dimensional periodic framework. In [computational solid-state physics](@entry_id:136630), such a structure is described by a combination of a lattice and a basis.

The **Bravais lattice** defines the periodicity of the crystal. It is specified by a set of three [primitive lattice vectors](@entry_id:270646), $\mathbf{a}_1, \mathbf{a}_2, \mathbf{a}_3$, which form the columns of a lattice matrix $\mathbf{H} \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$. These vectors define a repeating volume known as the unit cell. Any point in the crystal can be reached from an equivalent point in the unit cell by a translation of the form $\mathbf{T} = n_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \mathbf{a}_3$, where $n_1, n_2, n_3$ are integers. This periodicity is implemented in simulations via **Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC)**, where the unit cell is treated as if it is surrounded by infinite copies of itself.

The **basis** specifies the arrangement of atoms within this unit cell. Atomic positions are most conveniently expressed in **[fractional coordinates](@entry_id:203215)**, $\mathbf{s}_i \in [0,1)^3$, which are dimensionless coordinates relative to the [lattice vectors](@entry_id:161583). The [real-space](@entry_id:754128) Cartesian position $\mathbf{r}_i$ of an atom is then given by the transformation $\mathbf{r}_i = \mathbf{H}\mathbf{s}_i$.

Most zeolite frameworks possess a high degree of symmetry, which is mathematically described by a **[space group](@entry_id:140010)**. A [space group](@entry_id:140010) consists of all [symmetry operations](@entry_id:143398) (e.g., rotations, reflections, inversions) that leave the crystal structure invariant. This symmetry allows for a more compact description of the structure. Instead of listing all atoms in the unit cell, one only needs to specify the positions of atoms in the **asymmetric unit**, the smallest part of the structure from which the entire unit cell can be generated by applying the [space group](@entry_id:140010) operations.

For [zeolites](@entry_id:152923) specifically, the framework is an intricate network of corner-sharing $\text{TO}_4$ tetrahedra, where T (for "tetrahedral atom") is typically silicon (Si) or aluminum (Al). These are often called **T-sites**. To construct a computational model, one needs the essential crystallographic information: the lattice matrix $\mathbf{H}$, the [fractional coordinates](@entry_id:203215) of the atoms in the asymmetric unit (both T-sites and oxygen atoms), and the [space group](@entry_id:140010) operations. The **International Zeolite Association (IZA)** provides a canonical database of idealized framework topologies, each identified by a unique three-letter code (e.g., MFI for ZSM-5, FAU for Faujasite). This IZA code serves as the definitive starting point for building a simulation cell, as it maps directly to a standard set of crystallographic data .

From this complete geometric description, other important [topological properties](@entry_id:154666) can be derived. These include the sizes of the rings in the framework (the number of T-sites in a minimal cycle) and the **channel dimensionality**, which describes whether continuous pores exist for [molecular diffusion](@entry_id:154595) along one, two, or three independent directions. It is crucial to recognize that these properties are emergent features of the atomic connectivity under PBC; they are useful for classifying and understanding zeolite behavior but do not, by themselves, uniquely define the framework geometry .

### Modeling the Active Site

While the overall framework provides the confining environment, catalytic activity in [zeolites](@entry_id:152923) originates at specific **active sites**. The generation and modeling of these sites are central to [computational catalysis](@entry_id:165043).

#### Brønsted and Lewis Acidity

The most common active sites in aluminosilicate [zeolites](@entry_id:152923) are **Brønsted acid sites**. These arise from the [isomorphous substitution](@entry_id:150526) of a tetravalent $\text{Si}^{4+}$ cation with a trivalent $\text{Al}^{3+}$ cation in the framework. This substitution creates a net negative charge of $-1$ on the $[\text{AlO}_4]^-$ tetrahedron. To maintain overall electroneutrality, this charge must be balanced by an extra-framework cation. When this cation is a proton ($\text{H}^+$), it localizes on one of the four oxygen atoms bridging the aluminum and a neighboring silicon atom, forming a **bridging [hydroxyl group](@entry_id:198662)**, denoted as $\text{Si–O(H)–Al}$. This proton is labile and can be donated to a basic molecule, making it a Brønsted acid according to the Brønsted–Lowry definition.

This structural model is consistent with a wealth of experimental and computational evidence. For instance, the characteristic infrared (IR) stretching frequency of this acidic proton, $\nu_{\text{OH}}$, appears around $3610\ \text{cm}^{-1}$. When a strong base like ammonia ($\text{NH}_3$) adsorbs, it readily accepts the proton to form the ammonium ion ($\text{NH}_4^+$), a process characterized by a very low activation barrier and a large exothermic adsorption energy (e.g., approximately $-120\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}$). In contrast, a weak probe molecule like carbon monoxide (CO) interacts only weakly with the Brønsted acid proton, primarily through a [hydrogen bond](@entry_id:136659) .

The distribution of aluminum atoms within the framework is not entirely random. It is governed by **Loewenstein's rule** (also known as the aluminum avoidance rule), which posits that $\text{Al–O–Al}$ linkages are energetically unfavorable and thus strongly avoided in stable zeolite frameworks. This local connectivity constraint implies that every $\text{AlO}_4$ tetrahedron must be surrounded by $\text{SiO}_4$ tetrahedra, leading to a global compositional limit of $\text{Si/Al} \ge 1$. It is important to distinguish this local structural rule from the global requirement of charge balance, which simply states that the total positive charge of extra-framework cations must equal the total number of framework aluminum atoms ($\sum_i z_i n_i = n_{\text{Al}}$) .

In addition to Brønsted sites, [zeolites](@entry_id:152923) can also contain **Lewis acid sites**. These are electron-pair acceptors and typically consist of [coordinatively unsaturated](@entry_id:151171) metal centers. In [aluminosilicates](@entry_id:151974), Lewis sites are often defect-associated species, such as extra-framework aluminum (EFAL) created during synthesis or through post-synthetic treatments like steaming (dealumination). Unlike Brønsted sites, they lack a [hydroxyl group](@entry_id:198662) and thus show no characteristic $\nu_{\text{OH}}$ band. They are identified by their ability to strongly bind probe molecules that are Lewis bases, such as CO, through dative coordination to the electron-deficient metal center. For example, a [coordinatively unsaturated](@entry_id:151171) $\text{Al}^{3+}$ species will bind CO much more strongly than a Brønsted acid site but will interact more weakly with $\text{NH}_3$ without undergoing [proton transfer](@entry_id:143444) .

#### Periodic vs. Cluster Models

Having identified the structure of the active site, a choice must be made on how to represent it computationally. Two main strategies exist: periodic models and finite cluster models.

**Periodic models** employ the full crystal structure within periodic boundary conditions. Typically, a **supercell** (an integer multiple of the [primitive unit cell](@entry_id:159354)) is used. The active site, for example an $\text{Al}$ substitution and a charge-compensating proton, is introduced into this supercell. This approach has the significant advantage of inherently including the long-range electrostatic and elastic effects of the infinite crystal. However, it comes at a high computational cost. Furthermore, because of the periodicity, the adsorbate and active site are replicated in every cell. This can lead to spurious interactions between an adsorbate and its periodic images if the supercell is not large enough. A common rule of thumb is to ensure the minimum distance between an atom and its own periodic image is greater than the typical [correlation length](@entry_id:143364) of [intermolecular interactions](@entry_id:750749), often taken to be around $10-15\ \mathrm{\AA}$ .

**Cluster models** offer a computationally less expensive alternative. Here, a finite, often spherical, fragment of the zeolite is "cut" from the crystal, with the active site at its center. A major challenge with this approach is the treatment of the boundary. The cutting process creates artificial dangling bonds (e.g., on Si atoms that were bonded to oxygen atoms now removed). These must be terminated to avoid unphysical electronic states. A standard practice is to use **link atoms**, most commonly hydrogen atoms, placed along the direction of the original bond to passivate the dangling bond and preserve the local [tetrahedral geometry](@entry_id:136416). The outermost atoms of the cluster are often fixed at their crystallographic positions to mimic the mechanical rigidity of the surrounding framework. While cluster models can be effective for studying local chemical phenomena, they suffer from two main artifacts: the absence of the long-range Madelung potential of the crystal and the artificial mechanical constraints at the boundary. The error due to missing [long-range electrostatics](@entry_id:139854), for a neutral cluster, is dominated by dipole and higher-order terms, and its effect on calculated energies typically decays with cluster radius $R$ as $\mathcal{O}(R^{-3})$ or faster .

### Energetics of Adsorption and Reaction

With a structural model in place, the next step is to compute the energies that govern catalytic processes. This is typically done using electronic structure methods, most commonly Density Functional Theory (DFT).

#### The Crucial Role of London Dispersion

A key challenge in accurately modeling interactions within [zeolites](@entry_id:152923) is the proper description of [non-covalent forces](@entry_id:188178), particularly **London dispersion**. These attractive forces arise from correlated, instantaneous fluctuations in electron density between molecules or between a molecule and the framework. They are a manifestation of non-local [electron correlation](@entry_id:142654).

Standard DFT functionals, especially those based on the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA, e.g., PBE), are "semilocal" by construction. They approximate the [exchange-correlation energy](@entry_id:138029) based only on the electron density and its gradient at a given point. Consequently, they fail to capture the long-range, [non-local correlation](@entry_id:180194) that gives rise to dispersion. This leads to a systematic underestimation of the attraction between a hydrocarbon adsorbate and the (often nonpolar) zeolite wall.

This is not a minor effect. For hydrocarbons in micropores, the cumulative effect of numerous weak adsorbate-framework interactions can amount to a substantial stabilization energy. For example, a GGA calculation might predict an [adsorption energy](@entry_id:180281) of $-40\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}$ for a hydrocarbon, whereas including dispersion corrections can deepen this well to $-70\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}$ or more.

Crucially, [dispersion forces](@entry_id:153203) do not just affect adsorption; they can also alter reaction barriers. The activation energy, $E_a = E(\text{TS}) - E(\text{IS})$, is the difference in energy between the transition state (TS) and the initial adsorbed state (IS). If dispersion stabilizes the TS and IS to different extents, the barrier will change. It is often observed that the transition state, being a transient and often more compact structure, fits more snugly into the catalytic pocket than the reactant. This leads to stronger dispersion interactions and a greater stabilization for the TS. For instance, an uncorrected GGA calculation might yield a barrier of $120\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}$, but when dispersion is included, the TS might be stabilized by an additional $50\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}$ while the reactant is only stabilized by an extra $32\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}$. This differential stabilization of $18\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}$ lowers the calculated activation barrier to $102\ \text{kJ mol}^{-1}$, a significant kinetic effect .

To remedy this deficiency in DFT, various correction schemes have been developed. These range from empirical pairwise-additive corrections (such as the Grimme D3 method) to more sophisticated, fully non-local functionals (e.g., vdW-DF) and high-level theoretical methods (e.g., Many-Body Dispersion, MBD, or the Random Phase Approximation, RPA) that can also account for non-additive, many-body screening effects present in the dense pore environment .

#### From Electronic Energies to Thermodynamic Quantities

DFT calculations provide the ground-state electronic energy, $E_{\text{el}}$, at a temperature of $0\ \text{K}$ for a given fixed nuclear geometry. To compare with experimental thermodynamic data, these energies must be converted into enthalpies ($H$) and Gibbs free energies ($G$).

For an adsorption process $A_{\text{g}} + * \rightarrow A^*$, where a gas-phase molecule $A$ adsorbs onto a vacant site $*$, the purely electronic adsorption energy is defined as:
$$
\Delta E = E_{\text{el}}(A^*) - E_{\text{el}}(*) - E_{\text{el}}(A_{\text{g}})
$$
To obtain the standard [enthalpy of adsorption](@entry_id:171774) at a temperature $T$, $\Delta H^\circ(T)$, several corrections must be added. First, the **Zero-Point Energy (ZPE)**, which is the residual [vibrational energy](@entry_id:157909) at $0\ \text{K}$ due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, must be included. It is calculated within the harmonic approximation from the [vibrational frequencies](@entry_id:199185) $\nu_i$ as $E_{\text{ZP}} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_i h \nu_i$. Second, thermal corrections that account for the population of excited vibrational, rotational, and translational states at temperature $T$ must be added.

The standard enthalpy of a species $X$ at temperature $T$ is given by $H^\circ(X,T) = E_{\text{el}}(X) + E_{\text{ZP}}(X) + \Delta H_{\text{th}}^\circ(X,T)$, where $\Delta H_{\text{th}}^\circ(X,T)$ is the thermal enthalpy correction. For the gas-phase molecule, this correction includes contributions from translation, rotation, and vibration, as well as the $pV$ term, which for an ideal gas at standard pressure $p^\circ$ is $RT$. For the adsorbed species and the clean zeolite framework, which are condensed phases, the translational and [rotational degrees of freedom](@entry_id:141502) are quenched (becoming low-frequency vibrations known as frustrated translations and rotations), and the $pV$ term is negligible.

The standard Gibbs free energy of adsorption, $\Delta G^\circ(T)$, is then obtained from the fundamental relation $G = H - TS$:
$$
\Delta G^\circ(T) = \Delta H^\circ(T) - T \Delta S^\circ(T)
$$
where $\Delta H^\circ(T)$ and $\Delta S^\circ(T)$ are the changes in standard enthalpy and entropy for the reaction, respectively. The entropy of the gas-phase molecule, $S^\circ(A_{\text{g}},T)$, includes translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions evaluated at the standard state pressure ($p^\circ = 1\ \text{bar}$). The entropies of the adsorbed species and the framework, $S^\circ(A^*,T)$ and $S^\circ(*,T)$, are typically calculated from their [vibrational modes](@entry_id:137888) using statistical mechanics .

A useful theoretical metric for the intrinsic [acidity](@entry_id:137608) of a Brønsted site is the **Deprotonation Energy (DPE)**, defined as the gas-phase energy required to remove the proton:
$$
\mathrm{DPE} = E(\mathrm{Z}^-)+E(\mathrm{H}^+)-E(\mathrm{Z}\text{-H})
$$
where $\text{Z-H}$ represents the neutral acid site and $\text{Z}^-$ its [conjugate base](@entry_id:144252). A smaller DPE corresponds to a stronger intrinsic acid. The DPE is formally identical to the gas-phase **Proton Affinity (PA)** of the [conjugate base](@entry_id:144252) anion $\text{Z}^-$. The energy of a gas-phase [proton transfer](@entry_id:143444) reaction, $\mathrm{Z}\text{-H} + \mathrm{B} \rightarrow \mathrm{Z}^- + \mathrm{BH}^+$, can be expressed as:
$$
\Delta E = \mathrm{DPE}(\mathrm{Z}\text{-H}) - \mathrm{PA}(\mathrm{B})
$$
The reaction is exothermic if the base B has a higher [proton affinity](@entry_id:193250) than the zeolite's [conjugate base](@entry_id:144252). However, this gas-phase picture is incomplete. Inside the zeolite pore, the charged products ($\mathrm{Z}^-$ and $\mathrm{BH}^+$) are strongly stabilized by the polarizable framework, an effect that can be large enough to make a gas-phase [endothermic reaction](@entry_id:139150) become exothermic inside the catalyst .

### Reaction Pathways and Selectivity

#### Finding the Minimum Energy Path

A chemical reaction can be visualized as the system moving from a reactant valley to a product valley on a high-dimensional **Potential Energy Surface (PES)**, $E(\mathbf{R})$, where $\mathbf{R}$ represents the coordinates of all atoms. Reactants and products correspond to local minima on this surface, where the gradient of the energy (the force) is zero, $\nabla E(\mathbf{R})=\mathbf{0}$, and the Hessian matrix of second derivatives, $\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{R})=\nabla\nabla E(\mathbf{R})$, has all positive eigenvalues.

The path of lowest energy connecting a reactant and a product is called the **Minimum Energy Path (MEP)**. The highest point along this path is the **transition state**, which is a [first-order saddle point](@entry_id:165164) on the PES. At the transition state, $\mathbf{R}^\ddagger$, the gradient is also zero, but the Hessian has exactly one negative eigenvalue. The eigenvector corresponding to this negative eigenvalue defines the reaction coordinate at the saddle point. The energy difference between the transition state and the reactant minimum is the activation barrier.

Locating these elusive saddle points is a primary goal of computational catalysis. Two classes of algorithms are widely used:

1.  **Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) Method:** This is a chain-of-states method that finds the MEP between a known reactant and product. A series of "images" (replicas of the system) are created to form a discrete path. The optimization algorithm then moves these images to converge onto the MEP. This is achieved by projecting the forces on each image into two components. The component of the true force from the PES that is perpendicular to the path pushes the image towards the MEP. The component of an artificial spring force that is parallel to the path acts to keep the images equally spaced. A common variant, **Climbing-Image NEB (CI-NEB)**, allows the highest-energy image to move "uphill" along the path tangent to converge exactly onto the saddle point .

2.  **Dimer Method:** This is a local method that does not require knowledge of the product state. It starts with an initial guess and seeks to find a saddle point in its vicinity. It uses a "dimer"—two closely spaced images—to numerically find the direction of lowest curvature at the dimer's center. It then translates the dimer "uphill" along this direction while minimizing the energy in all perpendicular directions. This process iteratively converges to a [first-order saddle point](@entry_id:165164) .

When implementing these path-finding algorithms in periodic systems like [zeolites](@entry_id:152923), it is essential to correctly handle atomic displacements that cross the periodic cell boundaries. This is done using the **minimum-image convention**, which ensures that the distance and direction between two atoms (or between an atom in two consecutive images) are always calculated as the shortest path in the periodically tiled space .

#### The Origins of Shape Selectivity

The confining environment of the zeolite pore network is not a passive spectator; it actively influences which reactions can occur and which products can form. This phenomenon, known as **[shape selectivity](@entry_id:152121)**, is a hallmark of [zeolite catalysis](@entry_id:161162) and is broadly classified into three types.

**Reactant Shape Selectivity** acts as a [molecular sieve](@entry_id:149959) at the entrance of the pore system. It prevents molecules with a [kinetic diameter](@entry_id:201958) ($d_r$) larger than the zeolite's limiting pore diameter ($d_{\text{pore}}$) from entering the crystal and accessing the internal [active sites](@entry_id:152165). Reactions involving such bulky reactants are therefore suppressed .

**Product Shape Selectivity** acts as a filter at the exit. If a reaction inside the pore produces a molecule too large to diffuse out ($d_p > d_{\text{pore}}$), it will be trapped. The trapped molecule may eventually isomerize to a smaller product or form larger coke precursors that deactivate the catalyst. This mechanism favors the formation of smaller, more mobile products. The dimensionality of the channel network is also relevant; a 3D network offers more escape routes than a 1D channel, making it more resilient to blockage by trapped products .

**Transition-State Shape Selectivity** is arguably the most subtle and powerful form. It occurs when two or more competing reaction pathways are available at the active site. The zeolite cavity, often at a channel intersection with a characteristic diameter $d_{\text{int}}$, provides a constrained space for the reaction. A reaction pathway that proceeds through a sterically demanding, bulky transition state will be penalized by repulsive van der Waals interactions with the framework walls. This [steric hindrance](@entry_id:156748) raises the free energy of the transition state, $\Delta G^\ddagger$, thereby slowing down that specific pathway. A pathway with a more compact transition state will be less affected. This differential stabilization can dramatically alter the [product distribution](@entry_id:269160) compared to the same reaction in the gas phase or on an open surface. Computationally, this effect is captured within Transition State Theory by the partition function of the transition state, $q^\ddagger$. Confinement reduces the accessible configuration space, lowering $q^\ddagger$ and thus the rate. A bulkier transition state experiences a greater reduction in $q^\ddagger$, and this effect is most pronounced in smaller pores .

### Linking to Macroscopic Kinetics: Microkinetic Modeling

The ultimate goal of computational catalysis is to predict the overall performance of a catalyst under realistic conditions. This requires bridging the gap from the elementary steps calculated with DFT to the observable, macroscopic reaction rates. **Microkinetic modeling** provides the theoretical framework for this connection.

A [microkinetic model](@entry_id:204534) consists of a sequence of coupled ordinary differential equations that describe the [time evolution](@entry_id:153943) of the [surface coverage](@entry_id:202248) of all [reaction intermediates](@entry_id:192527). Its construction involves several key components:

1.  **Reaction Mechanism:** A complete set of all relevant [elementary steps](@entry_id:143394), including adsorption of reactants, desorption of products, and all surface-mediated transformations. For a reaction $A \rightarrow P$, a simple mechanism might be: $A(\text{g}) + * \rightleftharpoons A^*$, $A^* \rightleftharpoons P^*$, and $P^* \rightleftharpoons P(\text{g}) + *$.

2.  **Site Balance:** A conservation equation stating that the sum of the fractional coverages ($\theta_i$) of all species on the catalyst surface, including vacant sites ($\theta_*$), must equal one: $\theta_* + \sum_i \theta_i = 1$.

3.  **Rate Expressions:** For each elementary step, a rate expression is formulated based on the law of [mass action](@entry_id:194892), where the rate is proportional to the product of the activities of the reacting species. For gas-phase species, the activity is its [partial pressure](@entry_id:143994) normalized by a standard-state pressure ($a_i = p_i / p^\circ$). For surface species, in the simplest mean-field models, activity is taken as the fractional coverage ($\theta_i$).

4.  **Rate Constants:** The rate constants for each forward and reverse [elementary step](@entry_id:182121) are calculated using Transition State Theory, typically from the Eyring equation $k(T) = (k_B T / h) \exp(-\Delta G^\ddagger / RT)$, using the activation free energies derived from DFT.

Interactions between co-adsorbed species (so-called "lateral interactions") can be incorporated by making the activation barriers coverage-dependent, for instance, through a linear approximation $\Delta G^\ddagger(\theta_{\text{tot}}) = \Delta G^\ddagger_0 + \xi \theta_{\text{tot}}$. To maintain thermodynamic consistency (i.e., to ensure the equilibrium constant of a step does not depend on coverage), this coverage-dependent term must be applied to the transition state, affecting both the forward and reverse barriers equally for that step .

By assembling these components, one obtains a system of equations for the coverages (e.g., $d\theta_A/dt = \dots$, $d\theta_P/dt = \dots$). Solving this system, often by assuming a steady state for the surface intermediates ($d\theta_i/dt=0$), yields the surface coverages as a function of temperature and [partial pressures](@entry_id:168927). From these coverages, the overall rate of product formation can be calculated, providing a direct, parameter-free prediction of the catalyst's kinetic behavior.
