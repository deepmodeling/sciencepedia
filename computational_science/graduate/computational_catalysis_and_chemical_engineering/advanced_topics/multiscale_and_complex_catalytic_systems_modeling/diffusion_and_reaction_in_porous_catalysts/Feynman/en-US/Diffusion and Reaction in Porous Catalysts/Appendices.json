There are no subjective or opinion-based elements. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Flux and Effective Diffusivity\n\nThe starting point for describing diffusion in a binary gas mixture is the Maxwell–Stefan equation. For species $A$ diffusing in species $B$ at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, the equation is:\n$$\n\\nabla x_A = \\frac{x_B \\mathbf{N}_A - x_A \\mathbf{N}_B}{c D_{AB}}\n$$\nwhere $x_i$ is the mole fraction of species $i$, $\\mathbf{N}_i$ is the total molar flux of species $i$ relative to stationary coordinates, $c$ is the total molar concentration of the mixture, and $D_{AB}$ is the Maxwell–Stefan binary diffusivity.\n\nThe problem specifies equimolar counter-diffusion, which is defined by the condition that the molar fluxes of the two species are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}_A + \\mathbf{N}_B = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\mathbf{N}_B = -\\mathbf{N}_A\n$$\nThis condition also implies that the net molar flux is zero, which is consistent with the stated assumption of negligible bulk flow. Under this condition, the total flux $\\mathbf{N}_A$ is purely diffusive, so $\\mathbf{N}_A = \\mathbf{J}_A$, where $\\mathbf{J}_A$ is the diffusive flux.\n\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{N}_B = -\\mathbf{N}_A$ into the Maxwell–Stefan equation gives:\n$$\n\\nabla x_A = \\frac{x_B \\mathbf{N}_A - x_A (-\\mathbf{N}_A)}{c D_{AB}} = \\frac{(x_B + x_A) \\mathbf{N}_A}{c D_{AB}}\n$$\nSince for a binary mixture $x_A + x_B = 1$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla x_A = \\frac{\\mathbf{N}_A}{c D_{AB}}\n$$\nRearranging for the molar flux $\\mathbf{N}_A$ (which is the diffusive flux $\\mathbf{J}_A$ in this case), we obtain the expression for the flux within the fluid-filled pores. This is the Fickian form for equimolar counter-diffusion in the bulk phase:\n$$\n\\mathbf{N}_A_|_{\\text{pore}} = \\mathbf{J}_A_|_{\\text{pore}} = -c D_{AB} \\nabla x_A\n$$\nThis equation describes the flux per unit area of the pore space. The problem asks for the *averaged* diffusive molar flux in the pellet, denoted here as $\\mathbf{J}_A^*$. This is a superficial flux, averaged over the total cross-sectional area of the pellet (solid matrix + pores). The presence of the solid matrix hinders transport in two primary ways, which are accounted for by the porosity $\\epsilon$ and tortuosity $\\tau$.\n\n$1$. **Porosity ($\\epsilon$)**: The flux can only occur through the void space of the pellet. The cross-sectional area available for diffusion is a fraction $\\epsilon$ of the total area. This reduces the superficial flux by a factor of $\\epsilon$.\n\n$2$. **Tortuosity ($\\tau$)**: The diffusion path through the interconnected pores is not a straight line but a tortuous path of effective length $L_{eff}$, which is longer than the straight-line distance $L$ across the pellet. The tortuosity factor $\\tau$ is a measure of this path elongation. The increased path length reduces the effective concentration gradient, and thus the flux. In the common model used in chemical engineering, the flux is considered to be inversely proportional to the tortuosity factor.\n\nCombining these two effects, the superficial (averaged) flux $\\mathbf{J}_A^*$ is related to the flux in the bulk fluid by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_A^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\tau} \\left( -c D_{AB} \\nabla x_A \\right)\n$$\nThis is the desired form of the averaged diffusive molar flux of $A$ in the pellet.\n\nThe effective binary diffusivity in the porous medium, $D_{AB}^*$, is defined such that the superficial flux follows a Fickian-like law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_A^* = -c D_{AB}^* \\nabla x_A\n$$\nBy comparing this definitional equation with the derived expression for $\\mathbf{J}_A^*$, we can identify the effective diffusivity:\n$$\n-c D_{AB}^* \\nabla x_A = -c \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\tau} D_{AB} \\right) \\nabla x_A\n$$\nThis directly yields the expression for the effective binary diffusivity:\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\tau} D_{AB}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation of $D_{AB}^*$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Porosity, $\\epsilon = 0.30$\n- Tortuosity, $\\tau = 2.0$\n- Bulk diffusivity, $D_{AB} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $D_{AB}^*$:\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = \\frac{0.30}{2.0} \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = 0.15 \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = 0.90 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nD_{AB}^* = 9.000 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^2 \\ \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\n### Qualitative Interpretation of the Flux\n\nThe relationship between the averaged molar flux of species $A$ and the gradient of its mole fraction is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J}_A^* = -c D_{AB}^* \\nabla x_A\n$$\nLet's consider diffusion in one dimension, along a coordinate $z$ normal to the pellet surface and pointing into the pellet. The flux and gradient in this direction are $J_{A,z}^*$ and $\\frac{dx_A}{dz}$, respectively.\n$$\nJ_{A,z}^* = -c D_{AB}^* \\frac{dx_A}{dz}\n$$\nThe problem states that there is a \"negative gradient in $x_A$ normal to the pellet surface\". This means:\n$$\n\\frac{dx_A}{dz}  0\n$$\nThis condition implies that the mole fraction of species $A$ decreases as one moves into the pellet. The concentration of $A$ is higher at the surface (and in the bulk gas) than it is inside the pellet.\n\nThe quantities in the flux equation have the following signs:\n- The total molar concentration $c$ is physically required to be positive ($c0$).\n- The effective diffusivity $D_{AB}^* = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\tau}D_{AB}$ is a product and ratio of positive physical quantities ($\\epsilon0$, $\\tau0$, $D_{AB}0$), so $D_{AB}^*  0$.\n\nTherefore, the term $-c D_{AB}^*$ is strictly negative. The sign of the flux $J_{A,z}^*$ is determined by the product of this negative term and the sign of the gradient:\n$$\nJ_{A,z}^* = (-c D_{AB}^*) \\left( \\frac{dx_A}{dz} \\right) = (\\text{negative term}) \\times (\\text{negative value})\n$$\nThe product of two negative numbers is a positive number. Thus, $J_{A,z}^*  0$.\n\nA positive sign for $J_{A,z}^*$ means that the diffusive molar flux of species $A$ is in the positive $z$-direction. Since the $z$-direction was defined as normal to the surface and pointing *into* the pellet, the flux is directed from the external bulk gas phase into the interior of the catalyst pellet. This is the physically expected result: diffusion occurs spontaneously from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration, which is what the negative sign in Fick's law correctly models.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of the characteristic diffusion time $t_D$ and characteristic reaction time $t_k$ for a reactant in a spherical catalyst pellet. Subsequently, these time scales must be compared to determine whether the transient approach to a new steady state is diffusion-controlled or reaction-controlled.\n\nFirst, we must ensure all given values are in a consistent set of units. We will use the International System of Units (SI). The pellet radius is given as $R=1.2\\,\\text{mm}$ and the effective diffusivity is $D_{\\text{eff}}=1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}$. We convert the radius to meters:\n$$R = 1.2\\,\\text{mm} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nNext, we derive the characteristic diffusion time, $t_D$, from first principles. The governing partial differential equation for the transient diffusion of a species with concentration $C$ in a sphere is given by Fick's second law in spherical coordinates:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D_{\\text{eff}} \\left( \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right) \\right)$$\nTo find the characteristic time, we perform a dimensional analysis of this equation. Let $[T]$ denote the dimension of time and $[L]$ denote the dimension of length. The characteristic length scale of the physical domain is the pellet radius, $R$. The time derivative term, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$, scales as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{t_D}$, where $\\Delta C$ is a characteristic concentration difference and $t_D$ is the characteristic diffusion time. The spatial derivative term, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r}$, scales as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{R}$. The entire right-hand side, representing the net diffusional flux, therefore scales as $D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta C}{R^2}$. For the transient process, the rate of accumulation must balance the rate of diffusion. Equating the scales of the two terms gives:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta C}{t_D} \\sim D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta C}{R^2}$$\nSolving for the characteristic diffusion time $t_D$, we find:\n$$t_D = \\frac{R^2}{D_{\\text{eff}}}$$\nThis quantity represents the time required for a concentration disturbance to propagate across the characteristic length $R$.

The rate of consumption of the reactant due to reaction is given by the rate law $r = kC$. The equation describing the change in concentration due to reaction alone is:\n$$\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC$$\nThe characteristic reaction time $t_k$ is the time scale over which the concentration changes substantially due to the reaction. From the equation, it is evident that $t_k$ is the time constant of the exponential decay. Dimensionally, the left side scales as $\\frac{\\Delta C}{t_k}$ and the right side scales as $k \\Delta C$. Equating these scales:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta C}{t_k} \\sim k \\Delta C$$\nSolving for the characteristic reaction time $t_k$, we obtain:\n$$t_k = \\frac{1}{k}$$\nUsing the given value for the rate constant:\n$$t_k = \\frac{1}{0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 2.0\\,\\text{s}$$\n\nFinally, we determine which physical process controls the transient approach to the new state. The controlling process is the one that is slower, meaning it has the longer characteristic time. We compare the calculated values of $t_D$ and $t_k$:\n$$t_D = 1.44\\,\\text{s}$$\n$$t_k = 2.0\\,\\text{s}$$\nSince $t_k  t_D$, the reaction process is slower than the diffusion process. Diffusion is rapid enough to transport reactants throughout the pellet faster than the reaction consumes them.

Mathematical Model Formulation**\nThe steady-state species balance for a reactant A in a spherical catalyst pellet is given by a differential equation balancing diffusion and reaction. For a spherical coordinate system, the balance is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 N_A\\right) + r_A = 0 $$\nwhere $r$ is the radial coordinate, $N_A$ is the molar flux of the reactant, and $r_A$ is the volumetric rate of formation of A.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n- The reaction rate is first-order consumption: $-r_A = kC$. Therefore, the rate of formation is $r_A = -kC$.\n- The flux is governed by Fick's law: $N_A = -D_\\text{eff} \\frac{dC}{dr}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the species balance equation, and assuming $D_\\text{eff}$ is constant, we get:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\left(-D_\\text{eff} \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right)\\right) - kC = 0 $$\n$$ D_\\text{eff}\\left(\\frac{d^2C}{dr^2} + \\frac{2}{r}\\frac{dC}{dr}\\right) - kC = 0 $$\nThis is the governing second-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $C(r)$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  Symmetry at the center of the pellet: $\\frac{dC}{dr} = 0$ at $r=0$.\n2.  Concentration at the pellet surface: $C = C_b$ at $r=R_i$, because external film resistance is negligible.\n\nTo solve this, we non-dimensionalize the equation. Let $\\psi = C/C_b$ and $\\lambda = r/R_i$. The equation transforms to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi}{d\\lambda^2} + \\frac{2}{\\lambda}\\frac{d\\psi}{d\\lambda} - \\left(\\frac{k R_i^2}{D_\\text{eff}}\\right)\\psi = 0 $$\nWe define the Thiele modulus for a first-order reaction in a sphere as $\\phi_i = R_i\\sqrt{k/D_\\text{eff}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\psi}{d\\lambda^2} + \\frac{2}{\\lambda}\\frac{d\\psi}{d\\lambda} - \\phi_i^2 \\psi = 0 $$\nThe solution to this equation with the boundary conditions ($\\frac{d\\psi}{d\\lambda}|_{\\lambda=0}=0$ and $\\psi(1)=1$) is:\n$$ \\psi(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\sinh(\\phi_i \\lambda)}{\\lambda \\sinh(\\phi_i)} $$\nwhich gives the concentration profile $C(r) = C_b \\psi(r/R_i)$.\n\n**2. Observed Rate and Effectiveness Factor**\nThe observed volumetric rate, $r_i$, is the total reaction rate within the pellet divided by the pellet volume, $V_p = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_i^3$. The total rate is equal to the total flux of reactant into the pellet at its surface:\n$$ \\text{Total Rate} = (-\\text{Area}) \\times N_A|_{r=R_i} = (4\\pi R_i^2) \\left. \\left( D_\\text{eff} \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) \\right|_{r=R_i} $$\nAfter evaluating the derivative and simplifying, one finds that the total rate is related to the effectiveness factor, $\\eta$. The effectiveness factor is the ratio of the actual (observed) rate to the ideal rate that would occur if the entire pellet were at the surface concentration $C_b$.\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{\\text{Observed Rate}}{\\text{Rate at } C_b} $$\nThe observed volumetric rate is thus given by:\n$$ r_i = \\eta(\\phi_i) \\times (\\text{Ideal Volumetric Rate}) = \\eta(\\phi_i) \\cdot (k C_b) $$\nFor a first-order reaction in a sphere, the effectiveness factor is a known function of the Thiele modulus:\n$$ \\eta(\\phi_i) = \\frac{3}{\\phi_i} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tanh(\\phi_i)} - \\frac{1}{\\phi_i}\\right) = \\frac{3}{\\phi_i^2} (\\phi_i \\coth(\\phi_i) - 1) $$\nCombining these, the model for the observed rate for a pellet of radius $R_i$ is:\n$$ r_\\text{model}(R_i; k, D_\\text{eff}) = k C_b \\, \\eta\\left(R_i\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D_\\text{eff}}}\\right) $$\n\n**3. NLS Formulation and Identifiability Analysis**\nTo estimate the unknown parameters $k$ and $D_\\text{eff}$ from the dataset $\\{(R_i, r_i)\\}$, we use Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS). The objective is to minimize the sum of squared differences between the measured rates $r_i$ and the model predictions $r_\\text{model}$:\n$$ J(k, D_\\text{eff}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[r_i - r_\\text{model}(R_i; k, D_\\text{eff})\\right]^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[r_i - k\\,C_b\\,\\eta\\left(R_i\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D_\\text{eff}}}\\right)\\right]^2 $$\nParameter identifiability depends on how changes in $k$ and $D_\\text{eff}$ affect the model output, which is analyzed through the asymptotic behavior of $\\eta(\\phi_i)$.\n\n- **Case 1: Reaction-controlled limit ($\\phi_i \\ll 1$)**\n  For small $\\phi_i$, $\\eta(\\phi_i) \\to 1$. The model simplifies to:\n  $$ r_i \\approx k C_b $$\n  In this regime, the observed rate is independent of the pellet radius $R_i$ and the effective diffusivity $D_\\text{eff}$. From the data, one can estimate $k$, but no information about $D_\\text{eff}$ can be extracted. Thus, $D_\\text{eff}$ is unidentifiable.\n\n- **Case 2: Diffusion-controlled limit ($\\phi_i \\gg 1$)**\n  For large $\\phi_i$, $\\coth(\\phi_i) \\to 1$, and the effectiveness factor has the asymptote $\\eta(\\phi_i) \\approx 3/\\phi_i$. The model becomes:\n  $$ r_i \\approx k C_b \\left(\\frac{3}{\\phi_i}\\right) = k C_b \\left(\\frac{3}{R_i\\sqrt{k/D_\\text{eff}}}\\right) = \\frac{3 C_b}{R_i}\\sqrt{k D_\\text{eff}} $$\n  Here, the observed rate depends on the pellet radius as $r_i \\propto R_i^{-1}$. The parameters $k$ and $D_\\text{eff}$ appear only as the product $\\sqrt{k D_\\text{eff}}$. Different pairs of $(k, D_\\text{eff})$ that yield the same value for this product will produce identical model predictions. Therefore, only the composite group $\\sqrt{k D_\\text{eff}}$ is identifiable, not the individual parameters.\n\n- **Case 3: Mixed-control regime ($\\phi_i = \\mathcal{O}(1)$)**\n  In this intermediate regime, the full, nonlinear expression for $\\eta(\\phi_i)$ must be used. The parameter $k$ appears both as a prefactor and within the argument of $\\eta$, while $D_\\text{eff}$ appears only within the argument of $\\eta$. This complex, nonlinear dependence means that the effects of $k$ and $D_\\text{eff}$ on the observed rate $r_i$ are distinct. The sensitivity functions $\\partial r_i / \\partial k$ and $\\partial r_i / \\partial D_\\text{eff}$ are not linearly dependent. Consequently, if the experimental data $\\{(R_i, r_i)\\}$ includes points in this regime, both $k$ and $D_\\text{eff}$ are structurally identifiable. However, in practice, the sensitivity functions can be highly correlated, making the NLS estimation problem ill-conditioned. This results in poor practical identifiability, meaning the parameter estimates may have very large confidence intervals unless the data are of high quality and the pellet sizes $R_i$ span a wide range, clearly capturing the transition between regimes.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Define the model prediction for each pellet as $r_\\text{model}(R_i; k, D_\\text{eff}) = k\\,C_b\\,\\eta(\\phi_i)$, where $\\phi_i = R_i\\,\\sqrt{k/D_\\text{eff}}$ is the Thiele modulus and $\\eta(\\cdot)$ is the spherical-pellet effectiveness factor... Estimate $(k, D_\\text{eff})$ by minimizing... $J(k, D_\\text{eff}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[r_i - k\\,C_b\\,\\eta(\\phi_i)\\right]^2$. With size variation alone: in the reaction-controlled limit ($\\phi_i \\ll 1$), $r_i \\approx k\\,C_b$ so $D_\\text{eff}$ is unidentifiable; in the diffusion-controlled limit ($\\phi_i \\gg 1$), $r_i \\propto \\frac{\\sqrt{k\\,D_\\text{eff}}}{R_i}$ so only the combination $\\sqrt{k\\,D_\\text{eff}}$ is identifiable; in mixed-control ($\\phi_i = \\mathcal{O}(1)$), both $k$ and $D_\\text{eff}$ are structurally identifiable from $\\{(R_i, r_i)\\}$, but the NLS Jacobian columns are highly correlated, causing poor practical identifiability unless $R_i$ spans a wide range and the data are informative.**\n- This option correctly states the model, the Thiele modulus, the NLS objective function, and provides a complete and accurate analysis of parameter identifiability in all three regimes, including the important distinction between structural and practical identifiability.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because external film resistance is negligible, the pellet surfaces are at $C_b$ and diffusion does not affect the observed rate. Therefore, define $r_\\text{model}(R_i; k) = k\\,C_b$ and estimate $k$ by minimizing $J(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[r_i - k\\,C_b\\right]^2$. ...**\n- The initial premise is flawed. Negligible *external* film resistance implies $C(R_i) = C_b$, but it does not eliminate the effect of *internal* (intrapellet) diffusion, which causes the concentration to drop below $C_b$ inside the pellet. The model $r_\\text{model} = k\\,C_b$ is only valid in the strict reaction-controlled limit and ignores the explicit goal of the pellet-size-variation experiment, which is to probe diffusion effects. The proposed method to estimate $D_\\text{eff}$ from residuals is ad-hoc and unfounded.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use the Thiele modulus $\\phi_i = R_i^2\\,k/D_\\text{eff}$ and define $r_\\text{model}(R_i; k, D_\\text{eff}) = k\\,C_b\\,\\eta(\\phi_i)$. ... Because $\\eta$ depends only on $\\phi_i$, the parameters $(k, D_\\text{eff})$ remain structurally non-identifiable for any regime...**\n- This option incorrectly defines the Thiele modulus. For a first-order reaction, the modulus is proportional to the characteristic length $R_i$, not its square. $\\phi_i^2 = R_i^2 k/D_\\text{eff}$, but $\\phi_i \\neq R_i^2 k/D_\\text{eff}$. Furthermore, the conclusion that the parameters are always non-identifiable is incorrect. As shown in the derivation, they are structurally identifiable in the mixed-control regime.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Linearize the model in the mixed-control regime by plotting $r_i$ against $R_i^{-1}$. Fit a line $r_i = a + b\\,R_i^{-1}$ by least squares, then back out $k = a/C_b$ and $D_\\text{eff}$ from $b$. ...**\n- This option proposes a linearization that does not correctly represent the model. The functional form of $r_\\text{model}$ is not a simple linear function of $R_i^{-1}$. The interpretation of the fitted parameters is also incorrect. The intercept $a$ would correspond to the rate for an infinitely large pellet ($R_i^{-1} \\to 0$), which should be $r_i \\to 0$, not a value from which $k$ can be found. The rate approaches $k C_b$ for very small pellets ($R_i \\to 0$, $R_i^{-1} \\to \\infty$), which contradicts the interpretation of $a$ as the intercept. This approach is a flawed approximation.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.",
