By applying the Green-Kubo relations, you will connect the time-correlated velocity fluctuations of a particle, observable in a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, to its continuum-scale self-diffusion coefficient ($D$). This practice is essential for understanding how continuum models, such as those involving Fick's law, are directly parameterized and validated by atomistic simulations. ",

            "problem": "In equilibrium Molecular Dynamics (MD) of a dilute solute relevant to catalytic reaction environments, the self-diffusion coefficient connects atomistic velocity fluctuations to the continuum transport parameter used in Fickian species balance.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics (Green-Kubo relations) and computational chemistry (Molecular Dynamics), is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and uses objective, formal language. The provided data are physically plausible. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts: first, the derivation of the expression for the self-diffusion coefficient $D$; second, the numerical calculation of $D$; and third, a qualitative discussion on the practical aspects of its estimation from simulation data.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Self-Diffusion Coefficient Expression**\n\nThe transport coefficient for self-diffusion, $D$, is related to microscopic fluctuations through the Green-Kubo relations. Specifically, for a three-dimensional system, $D$ is given by the time integral of the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF) of a particle:\n$$\nD = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\langle \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) \\rangle \\, dt\n$$\nIn this expression, $\\mathbf{v}(t)$ is the velocity vector of the solute particle at time $t$, and the angle brackets $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ denote an ensemble average, which in the context of an equilibrium MD simulation is equivalent to a time average over multiple time origins.\n\nThe dot product $\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t)$ can be expanded in Cartesian coordinates as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) = v_x(0)v_x(t) + v_y(0)v_y(t) + v_z(0)v_z(t)\n$$\nBy the linearity of the ensemble average, we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) \\rangle = \\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle + \\langle v_y(0)v_y(t) \\rangle + \\langle v_z(0)v_z(t) \\rangle\n$$\nThe problem states that the medium is isotropic. In an isotropic system, there are no preferential directions. Therefore, the statistical properties of the velocity components are identical along each Cartesian axis. This implies:\n$$\n\\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle = \\langle v_y(0)v_y(t) \\rangle = \\langle v_z(0)v_z(t) \\rangle\n$$\nFurthermore, for an isotropic system in the absence of external fields (like a magnetic field), the velocity components are uncorrelated, meaning $\\langle v_i(0)v_j(t) \\rangle = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nSubstituting the equivalence of the diagonal terms into the expression for the full VACF, we get:\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbf{v}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(t) \\rangle = 3 \\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the Green-Kubo formula for $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} 3 \\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle \\, dt\n$$\nThe factor of $3$ cancels, leading to the desired expression for the self-diffusion coefficient in terms of the single-component VACF:\n$$\nD = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle \\, dt\n$$\nThis is the required derived expression linking $D$ to the given VACF.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of D**\n\nThe problem provides the functional form for the single-component VACF for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\n\\langle v_x(0)v_x(t) \\rangle = v_{0}^{2}\\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\nwhere $v_{0} = 100\\,\\text{m/s}$ and $\\tau = 0.5\\,\\text{ps}$.\n\nWe substitute this function into our derived expression for $D$:\n$$\nD = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_{0}^{2}\\exp(-t/\\tau) \\, dt\n$$\nSince $v_{0}^{2}$ is a constant, it can be taken out of the integral:\n$$\nD = v_{0}^{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\, dt\n$$\nThe integral is elementary:\n$$\n\\int \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\, dt = -\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$:\n$$\nD = v_{0}^{2} \\left[ -\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = v_{0}^{2} \\left( \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} (-\\tau \\exp(-t/\\tau)) - (-\\tau \\exp(-0/\\tau)) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nD = v_{0}^{2} \\left( 0 - (-\\tau \\cdot 1) \\right) = v_{0}^{2}\\tau\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for $v_{0}$ and $\\tau$. We must ensure consistent units. The desired unit for $D$ is $\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}$.\nThe value of $v_0$ is given as $100\\,\\text{m/s}$.\nThe value of $\\tau$ must be converted from picoseconds ($\\text{ps}$) to seconds ($\\text{s}$):\n$$\n\\tau = 0.5\\,\\text{ps} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s}\n$$\nNow, we compute $D$:\n$$\nD = (100\\,\\text{m/s})^{2} \\cdot (0.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s})\n$$\n$$\nD = (1.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}^{2}) \\cdot (0.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{s})\n$$\n$$\nD = 0.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}\n$$\n$$\nD = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, we express the result as $5.000 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^{2}/\\text{s}$.\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Discussion of Finite Sampling Effects**\n\nIn a practical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, the analytical VACF is unknown. Instead, it is estimated from a discrete velocity trajectory of finite length. This introduces errors in the calculated $D$ due to both the truncation of the integral and the discretization of time.\n\n**Truncation of the VACF Integral:**\nThe Green-Kubo integral extends to $t=\\infty$, but in practice, it must be truncated at a finite cutoff time, $t_{cut}$.\n- **Bias:** The VACF for a simple diffusive liquid is typically a positive, decaying function. Truncating the integral at $t_{cut}$ means neglecting the positive contribution from the tail of the function for $t > t_{cut}$. This leads to a systematic underestimation of the true diffusion coefficient. This negative bias is more severe if $t_{cut}$ is chosen too small, i.e., before the VACF has fully decayed to near zero.\n- **Variance:** The statistical uncertainty (variance) of the estimated VACF, $C_{est}(t)$, itself increases with lag time $t$. This is because for larger $t$, there are fewer pairs of points in the finite trajectory separated by that time lag, leading to poorer statistics. Integrating the VACF accumulates this noise. Extending the integration limit $t_{cut}$ further into the noisy tail of the function increases the variance of the resulting estimate for $D$. Therefore, there is a trade-off: increasing $t_{cut}$ reduces bias but increases variance.\n\n**Discretization of the Trajectory:**\nMD simulations produce velocities at discrete time steps, $\\Delta t$. The VACF is thus calculated at discrete points $t_k = k \\Delta t$, and the integral is replaced by a numerical sum.\n- **Bias:** The choice of the simulation time step, $\\Delta t$, affects the accuracy of the computed VACF. If $\\Delta t$ is too large, it may fail to resolve the initial, rapid decay of the VACF (for $t \\sim \\tau$). This leads to a numerical integration error, which manifests as a bias in the estimated $D$. The initial part of the VACF often contributes significantly to the integral, so accurately capturing its shape is critical.\n- **Variance:** The time step $\\Delta t$ is not the primary factor controlling the statistical variance of the estimate of $D$. The variance is fundamentally limited by the total simulation time, $T_{sim}$. A longer simulation provides more independent data for averaging, thus reducing the variance of the estimated VACF at all lag times and, consequently, reducing the variance of the final integrated value of $D$. While a smaller $\\Delta t$ provides more points, if $T_{sim}$ is short, these points are highly correlated, and the number of statistically independent segments of the trajectory remains small, resulting in high variance.",

No contradictions are present.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. A principled solution will be derived and implemented.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nThe objective is to determine how a symmetric uncertainty $\\pm\\delta$ in the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$, affects the unimolecular rate constant, $k$. We begin with the Eyring equation from Transition State Theory for a unimolecular reaction.\n\nThe rate constant $k$ is given by:\n$$ k = \\kappa \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the transmission coefficient, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ is the Gibbs free energy of activation.\n\nThe problem states that we assume $\\kappa=1$, which simplifies the equation to:\n$$ k = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nThis equation provides the direct link between the atomistic-scale energy $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ and the continuum-scale rate constant $k$. The pre-exponential factor, $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h}$, represents the characteristic frequency of crossing the transition state barrier.\n\nLet the central, or nominal, value of the activation free energy be denoted by $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger}$. The corresponding nominal rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{c}}$, is:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nThe activation free energy has a symmetric uncertainty $\\pm\\delta$, meaning its true value lies in the interval $[\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger} - \\delta, \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger} + \\delta]$. We must propagate this uncertainty to the rate constant.\n\nThe lower bound for the rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{lo}}$, corresponds to the highest possible energy barrier, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger} + \\delta$. A higher barrier kinetically impedes the reaction, resulting in a lower rate.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{lo}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} e^{-(\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger} + \\delta)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nUsing properties of exponents, we can rewrite this as:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{lo}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}\\right) \\cdot e^{-\\delta/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} = k_{\\mathrm{c}} \\cdot e^{-\\delta/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\n\nThe upper bound for the rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{hi}}$, corresponds to the lowest possible energy barrier, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger} - \\delta$. A lower barrier facilitates the reaction, resulting in a higher rate.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{hi}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} e^{-(\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger} - \\delta)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nSimilarly, we can rewrite this as:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{hi}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}\\right) \\cdot e^{\\delta/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} = k_{\\mathrm{c}} \\cdot e^{\\delta/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\n\nThe problem asks for a multiplicative half-range factor $f$ such that $k_{\\mathrm{hi}} = k_{\\mathrm{c}} \\cdot f$ and $k_{\\mathrm{lo}} = k_{\\mathrm{c}} / f$. From our derivations above, we can identify this factor.\nFrom the expression for $k_{\\mathrm{hi}}$, we have:\n$$ f = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{hi}}}{k_{\\mathrm{c}}} = e^{\\delta/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nLet's verify this with the expression for $k_{\\mathrm{lo}}$:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{lo}}}{k_{\\mathrm{c}}} = e^{-\\delta/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\delta/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}} = \\frac{1}{f} $$\nThis confirms our derivation. The uncertainty interval for the rate constant is $[k_{\\mathrm{c}}/f, k_{\\mathrm{c}} \\cdot f]$. The derived multiplicative factor is:\n$$ f = e^{\\delta/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nIt is crucial to note that this factor $f$ is independent of the central activation energy $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger}$ and depends only on the uncertainty magnitude $\\delta$ and the temperature $T$.\n\nThe implementation will proceed as follows:\n1.  Define all physical constants in SI units.\n2.  Convert the given energy uncertainty $\\delta$ from $\\mathrm{eV}$ to Joules.\n3.  Calculate the thermal energy term $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$.\n4.  Calculate the constant multiplicative factor $f = e^{\\delta / (k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$.\n5.  Iterate through the test suite of $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger}$ values.\n6.  For each $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger}$:\n    a. Convert $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger}$ from $\\mathrm{eV}$ to Joules.\n    b. Calculate the nominal rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{h} e^{-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{c}}^{\\ddagger}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$.\n    c. Calculate the lower and upper bounds: $k_{\\mathrm{lo}} = k_{\\mathrm{c}} / f$ and $k_{\\mathrm{hi}} = k_{\\mathrm{c}} \\cdot f$.\n    d. Collate the four values ($k_{\\mathrm{c}}, k_{\\mathrm{lo}}, k_{\\mathrm{hi}}, f$), ensuring each is formatted to six significant figures as a decimal representation.",

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Equation and Solution\n\nWe begin by performing a steady-state mass balance on a differential spherical shell of the catalyst pellet, with inner radius $r$ and outer radius $r+\\Delta r$. The mass balance equation is:\n$$ (\\text{Rate of mass in at } r) - (\\text{Rate of mass out at } r+\\Delta r) - (\\text{Rate of consumption by reaction in shell}) = 0 $$\nThe molar flux of species $A$ is given by Fick's first law: $N_A = -D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dC}{dr}$. The area for mass transfer is the surface area of the sphere, $4\\pi r^2$.\nThe rate of mass transfer into the shell at radius $r$ is $(4\\pi r^2 N_A)|_r$.\nThe rate of mass transfer out of the shell at radius $r+\\Delta r$ is $(4\\pi r^2 N_A)|_{r+\\Delta r}$.\nThe rate of reaction within the shell volume, $dV = 4\\pi r^2 \\Delta r$, for a first-order reaction is $(kC) (4\\pi r^2 \\Delta r)$, where $k$ is the volumetric rate constant.\n\nThe balance is:\n$$ (4\\pi r^2 N_A)|_r - (4\\pi r^2 N_A)|_{r+\\Delta r} - kC(4\\pi r^2 \\Delta r) = 0 $$\nDividing by $4\\pi \\Delta r$ and taking the limit as $\\Delta r \\to 0$ gives:\n$$ -\\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 N_A) - kCr^2 = 0 $$\nSubstituting Fick's law, $N_A = -D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dC}{dr}$, into the equation yields:\n$$ -\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\left(-D_{\\text{eff}}\\frac{dC}{dr}\\right)\\right) - kCr^2 = 0 $$\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right) - kCr^2 = 0 $$\nAssuming $D_{\\text{eff}}$ is constant, we divide by $D_{\\text{eff}}r^2$ to obtain the dimensional governing differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr}\\right) - \\frac{k}{D_{\\text{eff}}}C = 0 $$\nNext, we nondimensionalize the equation using the variables $\\rho=r/R$ and $c=C/C_s$. The derivatives transform as:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} = \\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\frac{d}{d\\rho} = \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{d}{d\\rho} $$\nSubstituting the dimensionless variables into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(R\\rho)^2} \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{d}{d\\rho}\\left((R\\rho)^2 \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{d(cC_s)}{d\\rho}\\right) - \\frac{k}{D_{\\text{eff}}}(cC_s) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{C_s}{R^2\\rho^2}\\frac{d}{d\\rho}\\left(\\rho^2 \\frac{dc}{d\\rho}\\right) - \\frac{kC_s}{D_{\\text{eff}}}c = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $R^2/C_s$ gives the dimensionless governing equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\rho^2}\\frac{d}{d\\rho}\\left(\\rho^2 \\frac{dc}{d\\rho}\\right) - \\frac{kR^2}{D_{\\text{eff}}}c = 0 $$\nThe dimensionless group that appears is the square of the Thiele modulus, $\\phi$. Thus, we identify the Thiele modulus as:\n$$ \\phi = R\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D_{\\text{eff}}}} $$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\rho^2}\\frac{d}{d\\rho}\\left(\\rho^2 \\frac{dc}{d\\rho}\\right) - \\phi^2 c = 0 $$\nExpanding the derivative, we get $\\frac{d^2c}{d\\rho^2} + \\frac{2}{\\rho}\\frac{dc}{d\\rho} - \\phi^2 c = 0$.\n\nThe physically appropriate boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the center of the pellet ($r=0$, so $\\rho=0$), the concentration profile must be symmetric, meaning the gradient is zero: $\\frac{dC}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$, which implies $\\frac{dc}{d\\rho}|_{\\rho=0} = 0$. Alternatively, one can state that the concentration must be finite at the center.\n2.  At the external surface of the pellet ($r=R$, so $\\rho=1$), the concentration is given as $C_s$: $C(R) = C_s$, which implies $c(1) = 1$.\n\nTo solve this ODE, we use the substitution $u(\\rho) = \\rho c(\\rho)$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{d\\rho^2} - \\phi^2 u = 0 $$\nThis is a standard second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution is $u(\\rho) = A \\cosh(\\phi\\rho) + B \\sinh(\\phi\\rho)$.\nThus, the solution for $c(\\rho)$ is:\n$$ c(\\rho) = \\frac{u(\\rho)}{\\rho} = \\frac{A \\cosh(\\phi\\rho) + B \\sinh(\\phi\\rho)}{\\rho} $$\nApplying the first boundary condition, the concentration $c(\\rho)$ must be finite at $\\rho=0$. As $\\rho \\to 0$, the term $\\frac{A \\cosh(\\phi\\rho)}{\\rho}$ approaches $\\pm\\infty$ unless $A=0$. Therefore, to ensure a physically meaningful finite concentration at the center, we must set $A=0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $c(\\rho) = \\frac{B \\sinh(\\phi\\rho)}{\\rho}$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $c(1)=1$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{B \\sinh(\\phi \\cdot 1)}{1} \\implies B = \\frac{1}{\\sinh(\\phi)} $$\nThe final closed-form expression for the dimensionless concentration profile is:\n$$ c(\\rho) = \\frac{\\sinh(\\phi\\rho)}{\\rho\\sinh(\\phi)} $$\n\n### Derivation of the Effectiveness Factor\n\nThe internal effectiveness factor $\\eta$ is defined as the ratio of the actual reaction rate in the pellet to the hypothetical rate if the entire pellet volume were exposed to the surface concentration $C_s$.\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{\\text{Actual Rate}}{\\text{Ideal Rate}} = \\frac{\\int_0^R k C(r) (4\\pi r^2) dr}{k C_s (\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3)} $$\nSimplifying and converting to dimensionless variables:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{\\int_0^1 c(\\rho) (4\\pi (R\\rho)^2 R d\\rho)}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3} = 3\\int_0^1 c(\\rho) \\rho^2 d\\rho $$\nSubstituting the expression for $c(\\rho)$:\n$$ \\eta = 3\\int_0^1 \\left(\\frac{\\sinh(\\phi\\rho)}{\\rho\\sinh(\\phi)}\\right) \\rho^2 d\\rho = \\frac{3}{\\sinh(\\phi)}\\int_0^1 \\rho\\sinh(\\phi\\rho) d\\rho $$\nThe integral can be solved using integration by parts, $\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du$. Let $u=\\rho$ and $dv = \\sinh(\\phi\\rho)d\\rho$. Then $du=d\\rho$ and $v = \\frac{1}{\\phi}\\cosh(\\phi\\rho)$.\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\rho\\sinh(\\phi\\rho) d\\rho = \\left[\\frac{\\rho}{\\phi}\\cosh(\\phi\\rho)\\right]_0^1 - \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\phi}\\cosh(\\phi\\rho) d\\rho $$\n$$ = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\phi}\\cosh(\\phi) - 0\\right) - \\left[\\frac{1}{\\phi^2}\\sinh(\\phi\\rho)\\right]_0^1 = \\frac{\\cosh(\\phi)}{\\phi} - \\frac{\\sinh(\\phi)}{\\phi^2} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{3}{\\sinh(\\phi)}\\left(\\frac{\\cosh(\\phi)}{\\phi} - \\frac{\\sinh(\\phi)}{\\phi^2}\\right) = \\frac{3}{\\phi}\\frac{\\cosh(\\phi)}{\\sinh(\\phi)} - \\frac{3}{\\phi^2} $$\nThe closed-form expression for the effectiveness factor is:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{3}{\\phi^2}\\left(\\phi\\coth(\\phi)-1\\right) $$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nThe given parameter values are $k=0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $R=1\\,\\text{mm} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$, and $D_{\\text{eff}}=1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\!/\\text{s}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Thiele modulus $\\phi$:\n$$ \\phi = R\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D_{\\text{eff}}}} = (1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}) \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\!/\\text{s}}} = 10^{-3}\\sqrt{5 \\times 10^8} = 10^{-3} \\times 10^4\\sqrt{5} = 10\\sqrt{5} $$\nNumerically, $\\phi \\approx 22.36067977...$. Rounded to four significant figures, $\\phi = 22.36$.\n\nNext, we calculate the effectiveness factor $\\eta$ using the derived expression:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{3}{\\phi^2}\\left(\\phi\\coth(\\phi)-1\\right) $$\nWith $\\phi = 10\\sqrt{5}$, we have $\\phi^2 = 500$.\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{3}{500}\\left(10\\sqrt{5}\\coth(10\\sqrt{5})-1\\right) $$\nFor large values of $x$, $\\coth(x) \\approx 1$. Since $\\phi \\approx 22.36$ is large, $\\coth(\\phi)$ is extremely close to $1$.\nSo we can approximate the term $\\phi\\coth(\\phi)-1 \\approx \\phi-1$.\n$$ \\eta \\approx \\frac{3(\\phi-1)}{\\phi^2} = \\frac{3(10\\sqrt{5}-1)}{500} \\approx \\frac{3(22.36067977-1)}{500} = \\frac{3(21.36067977)}{500} \\approx \\frac{64.08203931}{500} \\approx 0.1281640786 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\eta = 0.1282$.\n\nThe final numerical result is the ordered pair $(\\phi, \\eta)$.",
