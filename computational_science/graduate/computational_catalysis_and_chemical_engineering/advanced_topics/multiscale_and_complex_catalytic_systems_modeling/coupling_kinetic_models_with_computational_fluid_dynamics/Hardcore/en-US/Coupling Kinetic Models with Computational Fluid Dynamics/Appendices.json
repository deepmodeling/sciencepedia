            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in chemical reaction engineering, particularly in the study of heterogeneous catalysis coupled with transport phenomena. All necessary information is provided, and the tasks are logically structured and solvable.\n\n### Part 1: Rate Expressions and Coverage ODEs\n\nThe elementary reaction steps are modeled using mass-action kinetics. The rate of each step is proportional to the concentration (or surface coverage fraction) of its reactants. The site balance equation is $\\theta_A + \\theta_B + \\theta_* = 1$, which implies the fraction of free sites is $\\theta_* = 1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B$.\n\nThe elementary rates are as follows:\n- Adsorption of $A(g)$: $r_{aA}$. The rate is proportional to the gas-phase concentration of $A$ at the wall, $C_A$, and the fraction of available free sites, $\\theta_*$.\n$$r_{aA} = k_{aA} C_A \\theta_* = k_{aA} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)$$\n- Desorption of $A*$: $r_{dA}$. The rate is proportional to the surface coverage of $A$, $\\theta_A$.\n$$r_{dA} = k_{dA} \\theta_A$$\n- Surface reaction of $A*$: $r_{rA}$. The rate is proportional to the surface coverage of $A$, $\\theta_A$.\n$$r_{rA} = k_{rA} \\theta_A$$\n- Adsorption of $B(g)$: $r_{aB}$. The rate is proportional to the gas-phase concentration of $B$ at the wall, $C_B$, and the fraction of available free sites, $\\theta_*$.\n$$r_{aB} = k_{aB} C_B \\theta_* = k_{aB} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B)$$\n- Desorption of $B*$: $r_{dB}$. The rate is proportional to the surface coverage of $B$, $\\theta_B$.\n$$r_{dB} = k_{dB} \\theta_B$$\n\nThe time evolution of the surface coverages $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ is described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on the conservation of adsorbed species. The rate of change of a species' coverage is the sum of the rates of all elementary steps that produce it, minus the sum of the rates of all steps that consume it.\n\nFor species $A*$:\n- Formation is by adsorption of $A$: $r_{aA}$.\n- Consumption is by desorption of $A$ ($r_{dA}$) and surface reaction of $A*$ ($r_{rA}$).\nThe ODE for $\\theta_A(t)$ is:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = r_{aA} - r_{dA} - r_{rA}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = k_{aA} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{dA} \\theta_A - k_{rA} \\theta_A$$\n$$\\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = k_{aA} C_A (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - (k_{dA} + k_{rA}) \\theta_A$$\n\nFor species $B*$:\n- Formation is by adsorption of $B$: $r_{aB}$.\n- Consumption is by desorption of $B$: $r_{dB}$.\nThe ODE for $\\theta_B(t)$ is:\n$$\\frac{d\\theta_B}{dt} = r_{aB} - r_{dB}$$\n$$\\frac{d\\theta_B}{dt} = k_{aB} C_B (1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B) - k_{dB} \\theta_B$$\n\nThese two coupled ODEs describe the surface kinetics.\n\n### Part 2: Non-linear Coupling at the Boundary\n\nThe boundary condition for the gas-phase species transport equation (PDE) at the catalytic wall ($y=0$) equates the diffusive flux to the net rate of consumption or production of that species at the surface. For species $A$, the net rate of consumption from the gas phase, denoted $R_{A,net}$, is the rate of adsorption minus the rate of desorption.\n$$R_{A,net} = r_{aA} - r_{dA}$$\nThe boundary condition for the PDE governing $C_A(y,t)$ is therefore:\n$$-D_A \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} = R_{A,net} = r_{aA} - r_{dA}$$\nwhere $D_A$ is the diffusion coefficient of $A$ in the gas mixture.\n\nSubstituting the rate expressions from Part 1:\n$$-D_A \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} = k_{aA} C_A(y=0, t) \\theta_* - k_{dA} \\theta_A(t)$$\nUsing the site balance $\\theta_* = 1 - \\theta_A - \\theta_B$, the expression becomes:\n$$-D_A \\frac{\\partial C_A}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} = k_{aA} C_A(y=0, t) (1 - \\theta_A(t) - \\theta_B(t)) - k_{dA} \\theta_A(t)$$\nIn a fully coupled CFD-kinetic model, the unknowns are the fields $C_A(y,t)$, $C_B(y,t)$ and the surface coverages $\\theta_A(t)$, $\\theta_B(t)$. The wall concentrations $C_A(y=0, t)$ and $C_B(y=0, t)$ are part of the solution to the PDEs. The boundary condition explicitly contains products of these unknowns, such as $C_A(y=0, t) \\cdot \\theta_A(t)$ and $C_A(y=0, t) \\cdot \\theta_B(t)$. These product terms render the boundary condition, and thus the overall coupled problem, non-linear.\n\n### Part 3: Jacobian Matrix, Eigenvalues, and Stiffness Ratio\n\nWe are asked to linearize the system under conditions where $C_A$ and $C_B$ are constant. The ODE system is:\n$$f_A(\\theta_A, \\theta_B) = \\frac{d\\theta_A}{dt} = k_{aA} C_A - (k_{aA} C_A + k_{dA} + k_{rA}) \\theta_A - k_{aA} C_A \\theta_B$$\n$$f_B(\\theta_A, \\theta_B) = \\frac{d\\theta_B}{dt} = k_{aB} C_B - k_{aB} C_B \\theta_A - (k_{aB} C_B + k_{dB}) \\theta_B$$\nSince these equations are already linear in $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ for constant $C_A, C_B$, the Jacobian matrix of the right-hand side with respect to the vector of coverages $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\theta_A, \\theta_B)^T$ is a matrix of constants.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ is defined as:\n$$\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f_A}{\\partial \\theta_A} & \\frac{\\partial f_A}{\\partial \\theta_B} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f_B}{\\partial \\theta_A} & \\frac{\\partial f_B}{\\partial \\theta_B} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f_A}{\\partial \\theta_A} = -(k_{aA} C_A + k_{dA} + k_{rA}) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f_A}{\\partial \\theta_B} = -k_{aA} C_A $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f_B}{\\partial \\theta_A} = -k_{aB} C_B $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f_B}{\\partial \\theta_B} = -(k_{aB} C_B + k_{dB}) $$\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\\mathbf{J} = - \\begin{pmatrix} k_{aA} C_A + k_{dA} + k_{rA} & k_{aA} C_A \\\\ k_{aB} C_B & k_{aB} C_B + k_{dB} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbf{J}$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{J} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$, which is $\\lambda^2 - \\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J})\\lambda + \\det(\\mathbf{J}) = 0$.\n\nLet $J_{11} = -(k_{aA} C_A + k_{dA} + k_{rA})$, $J_{12} = -k_{aA} C_A$, $J_{21} = -k_{aB} C_B$, and $J_{22} = -(k_{aB} C_B + k_{dB})$.\nThe trace of $\\mathbf{J}$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) = J_{11} + J_{22} = -(k_{aA} C_A + k_{dA} + k_{rA} + k_{aB} C_B + k_{dB})$$\nThe determinant of $\\mathbf{J}$ is:\n$$\\det(\\mathbf{J}) = J_{11}J_{22} - J_{12}J_{21} = (k_{aA} C_A + k_{dA} + k_{rA})(k_{aB} C_B + k_{dB}) - (k_{aA} C_A)(k_{aB} C_B)$$\n$$\\det(\\mathbf{J}) = k_{aA} C_A k_{dB} + (k_{dA} + k_{rA})(k_{aB} C_B) + (k_{dA} + k_{rA})k_{dB}$$\nSince all rate constants and concentrations are positive, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) < 0$ and $\\det(\\mathbf{J}) > 0$. This guarantees that both eigenvalues are real and negative, indicating a stable system. The eigenvalues are given by:\n$$\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) \\pm \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J})^2 - 4\\det(\\mathbf{J})}}{2}$$\nThe stiffness ratio $S$ is the ratio of the magnitudes of the larger to the smaller eigenvalue. Let $\\lambda_{min}$ be the eigenvalue with the larger magnitude (more negative) and $\\lambda_{max}$ be the eigenvalue with the smaller magnitude (less negative).\n$$S = \\frac{|\\lambda_{min}|}{|\\lambda_{max}|} = \\frac{\\lambda_{min}}{\\lambda_{max}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) - \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J})^2 - 4\\det(\\mathbf{J})}}{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) + \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J})^2 - 4\\det(\\mathbf{J})}}$$\n\n### Part 4: Numerical Evaluation\n\nGiven parameters:\n- $C_A = 40\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$\n- $C_B = 20\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$\n- $k_{aA} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{m^3/(mol\\,s)}$\n- $k_{dA} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- $k_{rA} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- $k_{aB} = 500\\,\\mathrm{m^3/(mol\\,s)}$\n- $k_{dB} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the components of the Jacobian matrix elements:\n$$k_{aA} C_A = 2.5 \\times 40 = 100\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$k_{dA} + k_{rA} = 1.0 + 0.10 = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$k_{aB} C_B = 500 \\times 20 = 10000\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$k_{dB} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n\nNow, we assemble the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$:\n$$J_{11} = -(100 + 1.1) = -101.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$J_{12} = -100\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$J_{21} = -10000\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$J_{22} = -(10000 + 1000) = -11000\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} -101.1 & -100 \\\\ -10000 & -11000 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNext, we compute the trace and determinant of $\\mathbf{J}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) = -101.1 + (-11000) = -11101.1\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\n$$\\det(\\mathbf{J}) = (-101.1)(-11000) - (-100)(-10000) = 1112100 - 1000000 = 112100\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}$$\n\nThe characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 + 11101.1 \\lambda + 112100 = 0$.

The far-field concentration of $A$ is uniform and equal to $C_{\\infty}$, and the local coordinate $x$ measures distance from the plate leading edge. The molecular diffusivity of $A$ is $D$, and the kinematic viscosity of the liquid is $\\nu$. The surface reaction at the wall is first-order in the local interfacial concentration, with intrinsic surface rate constant $k_{s}$, so that the surface molar consumption rate per unit area is $r'' = k_{s} C_{w}$, where $C_{w}$ is the concentration evaluated at the wall.\n\nA continuum Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver for the convective-diffusive transport of $A$ in the fluid is to be coupled to the surface microkinetics.

The problem is a standard exercise in chemical reaction engineering and transport phenomena.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested: derivation of the reactive boundary condition, derivation of the effective mass transfer coefficient, and numerical computation of this coefficient.\n\n### Derivation of the Mixed (Robin) Boundary Condition\n\nThe core principle for deriving the boundary condition at the catalytic surface ($y=0$) is the conservation of the reactant species $A$. At steady state, the molar flux of $A$ transported from the fluid *to* the surface must be equal to the rate at which $A$ is consumed *by* the first-order reaction on the surface.\n\nLet $N''_{A}$ be the molar flux of species $A$ per unit area. According to Fick's first law of diffusion, the flux vector is given by $\\boldsymbol{J}_{A} = -D \\nabla C$, where $C$ is the molar concentration of $A$ and $D$ is its molecular diffusivity. The problem defines the normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$ as pointing from the wall into the fluid. In the given coordinate system where the plate is at $y=0$, this corresponds to the positive $y$-direction, so $\\boldsymbol{n} = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$.\n\nThe molar flux of $A$ *towards* the wall is the component of the flux vector in the negative $y$-direction, evaluated at $y=0$.\n$$\n\\text{Flux to wall} = -(\\boldsymbol{J}_{A} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}})\\big|_{y=0} = -(-D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y})\\big|_{y=0} = D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y}\\big|_{y=0}\n$$\nThe rate of consumption of $A$ per unit area by the surface reaction is given as $r'' = k_{s} C_{w}$, where $k_{s}$ is the intrinsic surface rate constant and $C_{w} \\equiv C(x, y=0)$ is the concentration of $A$ at the wall.\n\nAt steady state, the flux to the wall equals the rate of consumption at the wall:\n$$\nD \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y}\\big|_{y=0} = k_{s} C_{w}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the boundary condition to be expressed in terms of the quantity $-D\\, \\nabla C \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}\\big|_{w}$. As established, $\\nabla C \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}\\big|_{w} = (\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y})_{y=0}$. We can rearrange our balance equation to match this form by multiplying by $-1$:\n$$\n-D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial y}\\big|_{y=0} = -k_{s} C_{w}\n$$\nSubstituting the vector notation, we arrive at the mixed (Robin) boundary condition:\n$$\n-D\\, \\nabla C \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}\\big|_{w} = -k_{s} C_{w}\n$$\nThis equation relates the wall-normal diffusive flux to the wall concentration, which is the required form for a reactive boundary condition in a continuum CFD solver. The left side represents the diffusive flux leaving the surface (and entering the fluid), which is negative because the species is being consumed at the surface.\n\n### Derivation of the Effective Mass Transfer Coefficient\n\nThe wall flux, which we denote as $N''_{w}$, is the rate of species consumption, $r''$. Thus, $N''_{w} = k_{s} C_{w}$.\nThe problem introduces a film model, which approximates the same flux using a mass transfer coefficient $k_{m}(x)$ and the concentration difference between the far-field fluid and the wall:\n$$\nN''_{w} = k_{m}(x) (C_{\\infty} - C_{w})\n$$\nWe now have a system of two equations for the flux, which involve the unknown wall concentration $C_{w}$:\n1. $N''_{w} = k_{s} C_{w}$\n2. $N''_{w} = k_{m}(x) (C_{\\infty} - C_w)$\n\nOur goal is to find an effective coefficient $k_{\\text{eff}}(x)$ such that $N''_{w} = k_{\\text{eff}}(x) C_{\\infty}$. To do this, we must eliminate $C_{w}$ from the system. From equation (1), we express $C_w$ in terms of the flux: $C_w = N''_{w} / k_s$. Substituting this into equation (2):\n$$\nN''_{w} = k_{m}(x) \\left(C_{\\infty} - \\frac{N''_{w}}{k_s}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we solve for $N''_{w}$:\n$$\nN''_{w} = k_{m}(x) C_{\\infty} - \\frac{k_{m}(x)}{k_s} N''_{w}\n$$\n$$\nN''_{w} \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{m}(x)}{k_s}\\right) = k_{m}(x) C_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\nN''_{w} \\left(\\frac{k_s + k_{m}(x)}{k_s}\\right) = k_{m}(x) C_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\nN''_{w} = \\left(\\frac{k_s k_{m}(x)}{k_s + k_{m}(x)}\\right) C_{\\infty}\n$$\nBy comparing this result with the desired form $N''_{w} = k_{\\text{eff}}(x) C_{\\infty}$, we identify the effective mass transfer coefficient as:\n$$\nk_{\\text{eff}}(x) = \\frac{k_s k_{m}(x)}{k_s + k_{m}(x)}\n$$\nThis expression is commonly written in terms of resistances, where the resistance is the inverse of the rate coefficient. The overall resistance is the sum of the individual resistances in series (mass transfer and reaction):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff}}(x)} = \\frac{1}{k_m(x)} + \\frac{1}{k_s}\n$$\nThis shows that the effective coefficient consistently combines the finite fluid-side mass transfer resistance ($1/k_m$) and the finite intrinsic reaction kinetic resistance ($1/k_s$).\n\n### Numerical Computation of $k_{\\text{eff}}$\n\nWe are asked to compute the value of $k_{\\text{eff}}$ at $x = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$ using the following parameters:\n- $u_{\\infty} = 0.20\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\nu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $D = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $k_{s} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $x = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the local film-model coefficient $k_{m}(x)$ by evaluating the dimensionless numbers.\n\n1.  **Reynolds Number ($Re_x$)**:\n    $$\n    Re_{x} = \\frac{u_{\\infty} x}{\\nu} = \\frac{(0.20\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1})(0.10\\,\\text{m})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{0.020}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}} = 20000\n    $$\n\n2.  **Schmidt Number ($Sc$)**:\n    $$\n    Sc = \\frac{\\nu}{D} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 1000\n    $$\n\n3.  **Sherwood Number ($Sh_x$)**: Using the given correlation:\n    $$\n    Sh_{x} = 0.332\\, Re_{x}^{1/2} Sc^{1/3} = 0.332 \\times (20000)^{1/2} \\times (1000)^{1/3}\n    $$\n    $$\n    Sh_{x} = 0.332 \\times (141.4213...) \\times (10) \\approx 469.52\n    $$\n\n4.  **Film Mass Transfer Coefficient ($k_m$)**: From the definition of the Sherwood number, $Sh_x = k_m x / D$:\n    $$\n    k_{m}(x) = \\frac{Sh_{x} D}{x} = \\frac{469.52 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^{2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1})}{0.10\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 4.6952 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n    $$\n\n5.  **Effective Mass Transfer Coefficient ($k_{\\text{eff}}$)**: Now substitute the values of $k_m$ and $k_s$ into the derived expression for $k_{\\text{eff}}$:\n    $$\n    k_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_m} + \\frac{1}{k_s}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4.6952 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}} + \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    k_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1}{(2.1298 \\times 10^{5}) + (0.3333 \\times 10^{5})\\,\\text{s}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{2.4631 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{s}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    k_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 4.0600 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n    $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required gives $4.060 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.",

The reaction kinetics are described by a simple first-order decay, which is a common and valid model. The numerical method, operator splitting with an explicit forward Euler update for the reaction part, is a standard technique in computational fluid dynamics and reactive transport modeling. The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of applied mathematics and chemical engineering.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated and provides all necessary information to perform the requested linear stability analysis and determine the maximum time step. The tasks are logically structured and lead to a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise, quantitative, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a linear stability analysis of the explicit time integration scheme for the reaction substep, followed by the determination of the maximum stable global time step for the full operator-split scheme.\n\nFirst, we analyze the reaction substep. The governing ODE for the reaction part is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}c}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\dot{\\omega}(c) = -k\\,c\n$$\nThe problem specifies that this ODE is discretized using an explicit forward time update, which corresponds to the Forward Euler method:\n$$\nc^{n+1} = c^{n} + \\Delta t \\, \\dot{\\omega}(c^{n})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the source term, $\\dot{\\omega}(c^{n}) = -k\\,c^{n}$, into the update equation gives:\n$$\nc^{n+1} = c^{n} + \\Delta t (-k\\,c^{n})\n$$\nFactoring out $c^{n}$, we obtain a relationship between the concentration at consecutive time levels:\n$$\nc^{n+1} = (1 - k\\,\\Delta t) c^{n}\n$$\nThis is a linear recurrence relation of the form $c^{n+1} = G \\, c^{n}$, where $G = (1 - k\\,\\Delta t)$ is the amplification factor. For the numerical solution to be asymptotically stable, the magnitude of the amplification factor must be less than or equal to one. This ensures that any initial error or perturbation does not grow unboundedly in time. The condition for stability is therefore:\n$$\n|G| \\leq 1\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $G$, we have:\n$$\n|1 - k\\,\\Delta t| \\leq 1\n$$\nThis inequality is equivalent to the following two conditions:\n$$\n-1 \\leq 1 - k\\,\\Delta t \\leq 1\n$$\nWe analyze each inequality separately. The right-hand side inequality is:\n$$\n1 - k\\,\\Delta t \\leq 1 \\implies -k\\,\\Delta t \\leq 0\n$$\nSince both the rate constant $k$ and the time step $\\Delta t$ are physically positive quantities ($k>0$, $\\Delta t>0$), this condition is always satisfied.\n\nThe left-hand side inequality is:\n$$\n-1 \\leq 1 - k\\,\\Delta t \\implies k\\,\\Delta t \\leq 2\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t$, we find the stability constraint for the reaction substep:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq \\frac{2}{k}\n$$\nLet us denote this constraint as $\\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}}$.\n\nThe problem involves a first-order operator splitting scheme. For such a scheme to be stable, the global time step $\\Delta t$ must satisfy the stability constraints of all the individual substeps. In this case, there are two substeps: the advection-diffusion transport substep and the reaction substep.\n\nThe stability constraint for the advection-diffusion substep is given in the problem statement:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\leq 0.05\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nLet us denote this as $\\Delta t_{\\text{transport}} = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe overall stability of the split-step scheme requires that $\\Delta t$ satisfies both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the maximum admissible global time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is the minimum of the maximum allowable time steps for each substep:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\min(\\Delta t_{\\text{transport}}, \\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}})\n$$\nWe are given the value for the rate constant $k = 900\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We can now calculate the limit imposed by the reaction stability:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}} = \\frac{2}{k} = \\frac{2}{900}\\ \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{1}{450}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow, we must compare the two time step limits:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{transport}} = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{5}{100}\\ \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{1}{20}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{reaction}} = \\frac{1}{450}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nSince $450 > 20$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{450} < \\frac{1}{20}$. Thus, the reaction substep imposes the more restrictive constraint on the global time step.\n\nThe maximum admissible global time step is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{450}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a numerical value rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{450}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.0022222... \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures yields $0.002222$. The first significant digit is the first $2$ after the zeros, and we keep three more digits. The fifth significant digit is $2$, so no rounding up is needed.\n\nThe maximum admissible global time step that ensures stability of the full split update is $0.002222\\ \\mathrm{s}$.",
