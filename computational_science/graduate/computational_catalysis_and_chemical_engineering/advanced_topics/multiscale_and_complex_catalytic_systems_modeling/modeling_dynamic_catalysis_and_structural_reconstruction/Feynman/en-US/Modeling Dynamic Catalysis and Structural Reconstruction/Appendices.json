            "introduction": "We begin with a foundational analytical exercise that explores the direct consequence of a periodically modulated energy barrier on a simple surface reaction. By deriving the exact time-averaged rate, you will uncover the non-intuitive but fundamental principle that oscillations can enhance overall catalytic activity due to the convex nature of the Arrhenius relationship. This problem  provides a crucial first insight into why dynamic operation can be advantageous compared to steady-state conditions.",

Here, $\\theta_A$ is the constant coverage of $A^*$ maintained by rapid adsorption-desorption relative to the reaction and structural dynamics, and $k(t)$ is the time-dependent rate constant arising from barrier modulation by periodic structural reconstruction. Assume the rate constant is $k(t) = k_0 \\exp\\!\\big(-\\alpha \\sin(\\omega t)\\big)$, where $k_0 > 0$ is a baseline rate constant, $\\alpha \\ge 0$ is a dimensionless modulation amplitude that encodes the sensitivity of the barrier to the structural coordinate, and $\\omega > 0$ is the angular frequency of the structural modulation imposed by an external stimulus.\n\nUsing only first principles of microkinetic modeling and time averaging of periodic functions, derive the exact time-averaged rate $\\langle r \\rangle$ over the long-time periodic steady state.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained and consistent framework for a standard problem in the microkinetic modeling of dynamic catalytic systems.\n\nThe instantaneous rate of the reaction $A^* \\rightarrow B^*$ is given by $r(t) = k(t)\\,\\theta_A$. The coverage of species $A^*$, denoted by $\\theta_A$, is constant. The rate constant $k(t)$ is a time-periodic function given by $k(t) = k_0 \\exp(-\\alpha \\sin(\\omega t))$, where $k_0$, $\\alpha$, and $\\omega$ are positive constants (with $\\alpha \\ge 0$). The period of the structural modulation, and thus of the rate constant $k(t)$, is $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$.\n\nThe primary task is to derive the time-averaged rate, $\\langle r \\rangle$, over a single period in the long-time periodic steady state. The time average of a periodic function $f(t)$ over its period $T$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\langle f \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} f(t) \\, dt\n$$\nApplying this definition to the rate $r(t)$:\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} r(t) \\, dt = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} k(t) \\theta_A \\, dt\n$$\nSince $\\theta_A$ is defined as a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle = \\theta_A \\left( \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} k(t) \\, dt \\right) = \\theta_A \\langle k(t) \\rangle\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given expressions for $k(t)$ and its period $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$:\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle = \\theta_A \\left( \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} k_0 \\exp(-\\alpha \\sin(\\omega t)) \\, dt \\right)\n$$\nThe constant $k_0$ can also be factored out:\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle = k_0 \\theta_A \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\exp(-\\alpha \\sin(\\omega t)) \\, dt\n$$\nTo solve the integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = \\omega t$. Then, $du = \\omega \\, dt$. The limits of integration change from $t=0$ and $t=2\\pi/\\omega$ to $u=0$ and $u=2\\pi$, respectively.\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle = k_0 \\theta_A \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(-\\alpha \\sin(u)) \\, du\n$$\nThis integral is a well-known integral representation of a modified Bessel function of the first kind. The definition of the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order $n=0$, denoted $I_0(z)$, is:\n$$\nI_0(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(z \\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta\n$$\nWe can show that the integral involving $\\sin(u)$ is equivalent to the one involving $\\cos(\\theta)$. Due to the $2\\pi$-periodicity of the integrand $\\exp(-\\alpha \\sin(u))$, we can shift the integration interval without changing the value of the integral. Let's make the substitution $u = \\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(-\\alpha \\sin(u)) \\, du = \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{3\\pi/2} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\sin\\left(\\theta + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) \\, d\\theta = \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{3\\pi/2} \\exp(-\\alpha \\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta\n$$\nSince the integrand $\\exp(-\\alpha \\cos\\theta)$ is itself periodic with period $2\\pi$, we can integrate over any interval of length $2\\pi$, such as $[0, 2\\pi]$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{3\\pi/2} \\exp(-\\alpha \\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(-\\alpha \\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta\n$$\nThus, the integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(-\\alpha \\sin(u)) \\, du = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(-\\alpha \\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta = 2\\pi I_0(-\\alpha)\n$$\nModified Bessel functions possess the property $I_n(-z) = (-1)^n I_n(z)$. For order $n=0$, this simplifies to $I_0(-z) = I_0(z)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(-\\alpha \\sin(u)) \\, du = 2\\pi I_0(\\alpha)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $\\langle r \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle = k_0 \\theta_A \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( 2\\pi I_0(\\alpha) \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression for the time-averaged rate:\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle = k_0 \\theta_A I_0(\\alpha)\n$$\nThis expression gives the exact time-averaged rate for any valid set of parameters. The question further asks to determine the dependence of $\\langle r \\rangle$ on $\\alpha$ and $\\omega$ in the fast ($\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty$) and slow ($\\omega \\rightarrow 0$) modulation limits.\n\nObserving our derived expression, we note that the time-averaged rate $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a function of $k_0$, $\\theta_A$, and $\\alpha$, but it is entirely independent of the modulation frequency $\\omega$. This is a direct consequence of averaging over an integer number of periods; the specific duration of the period does not affect the mean value of the periodic function. Therefore, the dependence of $\\langle r \\rangle$ on the parameters is the same for all $\\omega > 0$, including the limits as $\\omega \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nIn both the fast and slow modulation limits, the dependence is:\n1.  The time-averaged rate $\\langle r \\rangle$ is independent of the angular frequency $\\omega$.\n2.  The time-averaged rate $\\langle r \\rangle$ depends on the modulation amplitude $\\alpha$ through the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, $I_0(\\alpha)$. Since $I_0(\\alpha) \\ge 1$ for all real $\\alpha$ (with $I_0(0)=1$), the presence of oscillations ($\\alpha > 0$) always results in a time-averaged rate that is greater than or equal to the rate without modulation, $k_0 \\theta_A$. This phenomenon is a consequence of Jensen's inequality applied to the convex exponential function.\n\nThe single closed-form analytic expression for $\\langle r \\rangle$ remains $k_0 \\theta_A I_0(\\alpha)$ across all conditions specified.",

            "problem": "Consider a catalytic surface that can dynamically reconstruct between two structural states, denoted by $R_0$ (unreconstructed) and $R_1$ (reconstructed). Let $x(t)$ be the fraction of the surface in state $R_1$ at time $t$, so that the fraction in state $R_0$ is $1 - x(t)$. An adsorbate species $A$ with gas-phase partial pressure $p_A(t)$ controls the coverage $\\theta(t)$ of $A$ on the surface, and coverage in turn modulates the $R_0 \\rightleftharpoons R_1$ kinetics.\n\nAssume the following physically grounded laws:\n- Adsorption and desorption follow Langmuir kinetics with mass action, so that the coverage obeys the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $$\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p_A(t)\\,\\left(1-\\theta(t)\\right) - k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta(t),$$ where $k_{\\mathrm{ads}}$ has units $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ has units $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $\\theta(t)$ is dimensionless.\n- Reconstruction and deconstruction follow first-order transitions with coverage-modulated rates, $$\\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{01}\\!\\left(\\theta(t)\\right)\\,\\left(1 - x(t)\\right) - k_{10}\\!\\left(\\theta(t)\\right)\\,x(t),$$ where $k_{01}\\!\\left(\\theta\\right) = k_{01}^0\\,\\exp\\!\\left(\\alpha\\,\\theta\\right)$ and $k_{10}\\!\\left(\\theta\\right) = k_{10}^0\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\beta\\,\\theta\\right)$.

The use of Langmuir kinetics for adsorption/desorption and first-order rate laws for structural transitions, with rates modulated by adsorbate coverage, are standard and well-established formalisms in surface science and heterogeneous catalysis. The model is scientifically sound and represents a simplified but realistic picture of dynamic catalysis.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a system of two coupled, non-linear, first-order ordinary differential equations with a specified, piecewise-constant forcing function. Initial conditions are given. The rate functions are well-behaved, ensuring that the state variables $\\theta(t)$ and $x(t)$ remain within their physically meaningful bounds of $[0, 1]$. For a dissipative system under periodic forcing, convergence to a unique, stable limit cycle is expected. The procedure to find this limit cycle and compute the cycle-average is clearly defined. The problem is mathematically well-posed.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise mathematical and physical terms. All quantities are unambiguously defined. There is no subjective or opinion-based content.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** All parameters, equations, initial conditions, and objectives are provided. The units are internally consistent: for instance, in the $d\\theta/dt$ equation, both terms $k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p_A$ and $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ have units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is correct for a rate of change of a dimensionless quantity. The setup is complete and free of contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It poses a non-trivial numerical challenge rooted in established principles of chemical kinetics. The problem is declared **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the numerical solution of a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that model a dynamically reconstructing catalytic surface under periodic forcing. The state of the system is described by the vector $Y(t) = [\\theta(t), x(t)]^T$, where $\\theta(t)$ is the surface coverage of adsorbate $A$ and $x(t)$ is the fraction of the surface in the reconstructed state $R_1$.\n\nThe governing system of ODEs is:\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dt} = F(Y, p_A(t)) =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\\\\n\\frac{dx}{dt}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere the component functions are:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p_A(t)\\,\\left(1-\\theta\\right) - k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = k_{01}\\!\\left(\\theta\\right)\\,\\left(1 - x\\right) - k_{10}\\!\\left(\\theta\\right)\\,x\n$$\nThe reconstruction and deconstruction rate constants are modulated by coverage $\\theta$:\n$$\nk_{01}\\!\\left(\\theta\\right) = k_{01}^0\\,\\exp\\!\\left(\\alpha\\,\\theta\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_{10}\\!\\left(\\theta\\right) = k_{10}^0\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\beta\\,\\theta\\right)\n$$\nThe external control is the partial pressure $p_A(t)$, which follows a square-wave pattern with period $T$, duty cycle $d$, high pressure $p_{\\mathrm{high}}$, and low pressure $p_{\\mathrm{low}}$.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main stages:\n1.  **Finding the Periodic Steady State (Limit Cycle):** The system is simulated forward in time, starting from the initial condition $Y(0) = [\\theta(0), x(0)]^T = [0, 0]^T$. The simulation progresses period by period. For each period, the integration is split into two segments corresponding to the piecewise-constant pressure:\n    - An interval of duration $d T$ with $p_A = p_{\\mathrm{high}}$.\n    - An interval of duration $(1-d)T$ with $p_A = p_{\\mathrm{low}}$.\n    Let $Y_n$ be the state of the system at the start of the $n$-th period. We numerically integrate the ODEs over one full period to obtain the state $Y_{n+1}$ at the beginning of the next period. This iterative process is repeated until the system reaches a periodic steady state, or limit cycle. Convergence is declared when the state vector at the start of a period no longer changes significantly, i.e., when the Euclidean norm of the difference between successive states falls below a small tolerance $\\epsilon$: $\\|Y_{n+1} - Y_n\\| < \\epsilon$. We use a robust numerical ODE solver, `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, for this task.\n\n2.  **Calculating the Cycle-Averaged Reconstructed Fraction $\\bar{x}$:** Once the periodic steady state is reached, let the state at the beginning of a stable period be $Y_{ss}$. We then perform one final, high-precision integration over a single period starting from $Y_{ss}$. To compute the integral $\\int_{t_0}^{t_0+T} x(t)\\,dt$, we instruct the `solve_ivp` function to produce a \"dense output\". This provides a continuous interpolating function (a polynomial spline) that represents the solution $x(t)$ accurately between the solver's internal time steps.\nThe cycle-averaged value is then given by:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{t_{ss}}^{t_{ss} + T} x(t)\\,dt\n$$\nThis integral is computed by breaking it into two parts corresponding to the pressure phases and using a standard numerical quadrature routine, `scipy.integrate.quad`, on the interpolants for $x(t)$ generated by `solve_ivp`:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\int_{t_{ss}}^{t_{ss}+dT} x_{\\mathrm{high}}(t)\\,dt + \\int_{t_{ss}+dT}^{t_{ss}+T} x_{\\mathrm{low}}(t)\\,dt \\right)\n$$\nwhere $x_{\\mathrm{high}}(t)$ and $x_{\\mathrm{low}}(t)$ are the solution functions during the high- and low-pressure segments, respectively.\n\nThe final implementation will be a Python script that defines the ODE system and parameters, then executes this two-stage numerical procedure for each of the four test cases specified in the problem statement. The resulting values of $\\bar{x}$ are rounded to six decimal places and formatted as a list.",

Let $ \\theta \\in [0,1] $ denote the fractional coverage of an adsorbate on catalytic sites and let $ r \\in [0,1] $ denote the fractional extent of surface reconstruction. The model respects mass-action kinetics for adsorption and desorption, and linear kinetics for reconstruction/relaxation, with the reconstruction reducing adsorption strength.

All parameters are positive. The negative feedback loop is represented by the factor $ e^{-\\alpha r} $ that reduces adsorption strength as $ r $ increases, which in turn reduces coverage $ \\theta $, reducing the driving force for reconstruction.\n\nA steady state $ (\\theta^\\ast, r^\\ast) $ satisfies\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,e^{-\\alpha r^\\ast}\\,p\\,(1-\\theta^\\ast) \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta^\\ast,\n$$\n$$\n0 \\;=\\; k_{\\mathrm{rec}}\\,\\theta^\\ast \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{rel}}\\,r^\\ast,\n$$\nso that $ r^\\ast = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel}}}\\right)\\,\\theta^\\ast $ and $ \\theta^\\ast $ is the unique root in $ (0,1) $ of\n$$\nf(\\theta) \\;=\\; k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,e^{-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel}}}\\right)\\theta}\\,p\\,(1-\\theta) \\;-\\; k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta.\n$$\nTo analyze the local stability and the presence or absence of small-amplitude oscillations in the linear response near $ (\\theta^\\ast, r^\\ast) $, consider the Jacobian matrix $ J $ of the ODEs evaluated at $ (\\theta^\\ast,r^\\ast) $:\n$$ J = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial r} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial \\theta} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial r} \\end{bmatrix}_{(\\theta^\\ast,r^\\ast)} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\,k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,e^{-\\alpha r^\\ast}\\,p - k_{\\mathrm{des}} & -\\,k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,e^{-\\alpha r^\\ast}\\,p\\,(1-\\theta^\\ast) \\\\ k_{\\mathrm{rec}} & -\\,k_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nDefine the trace $ t = \\mathrm{tr}(J) $ and determinant $ d = \\det(J) $.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been meticulously reviewed and is determined to be valid. It presents a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in the field of computational chemical engineering, specifically concerning the stability analysis of a dynamic model for catalysis. All parameters, equations, and objectives are clearly defined, constituting a standard application of numerical methods and dynamical systems theory.\n\nThe problem requires determining whether the linearized dynamics around a steady state exhibit oscillations. This involves a four-step process:\n1.  Numerically determine the steady-state adsorbate coverage, $ \\theta^\\ast $.\n2.  Calculate the steady-state surface reconstruction, $ r^\\ast $.\n3.  Evaluate the trace $ t $ and determinant $ d $ of the system's Jacobian matrix at the steady state $ (\\theta^\\ast, r^\\ast) $.\n4.  Apply the criterion for oscillatory behavior, which corresponds to complex eigenvalues of the Jacobian.\n\n**Step 1: Steady-State Analysis**\n\nThe steady state $ (\\theta^\\ast, r^\\ast) $ of the system is defined by the condition $ \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = 0 $ and $ \\frac{dr}{dt} = 0 $.\nThe second steady-state equation, $ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{rec}}\\,\\theta^\\ast - k_{\\mathrm{rel}}\\,r^\\ast $, provides a direct linear relationship between $ r^\\ast $ and $ \\theta^\\ast $:\n$$\nr^\\ast = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel}}}\\right)\\theta^\\ast\n$$\nSubstituting this into the first steady-state equation, $ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,e^{-\\alpha r^\\ast}\\,p\\,(1-\\theta^\\ast) - k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta^\\ast $, yields a single transcendental equation for $ \\theta^\\ast $:\n$$\nf(\\theta^\\ast) = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,e^{-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{k_{\\mathrm{rel}}}\\right)\\theta^\\ast}(1-\\theta^\\ast) - k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta^\\ast = 0\n$$\nTo solve for $ \\theta^\\ast $, we must find the root of the function $ f(\\theta) $ in the physically meaningful interval $ (0, 1) $. We can analyze the function at the interval boundaries:\n-   At $ \\theta = 0 $, $ f(0) = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,e^0(1-0) - k_{\\mathrm{des}}(0) = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p $. Since all parameters $ k_{\\mathrm{ads}} $, $ s_0 $, and $ p $ are positive, $ f(0) > 0 $.\n-   At $ \\theta = 1 $, $ f(1) = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,e^{-\\alpha (k_{\\mathrm{rec}}/k_{\\mathrm{rel}})}(1-1) - k_{\\mathrm{des}}(1) = -k_{\\mathrm{des}} $. Since $ k_{\\mathrm{des}} > 0 $, $ f(1) < 0 $.\n\nSince $ f(\\theta) $ is continuous on $ [0, 1] $ and $ f(0) > 0 $ and $ f(1) < 0 $, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of at least one root $ \\theta^\\ast \\in (0, 1) $. The problem statement asserts this root is unique. A robust numerical root-finding algorithm, such as the Brent-Dekker method (`brentq` in SciPy), is suitable for locating this root given the bracket $ (0, 1) $.\n\n**Step 2: Jacobian Matrix and Simplification**\n\nThe local stability of the steady state is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $ J $ evaluated at $ (\\theta^\\ast, r^\\ast) $. The general form of the Jacobian is given as:\n$$\nJ =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\,k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,e^{-\\alpha r} - k_{\\mathrm{des}} & -\\,\\alpha\\,k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,e^{-\\alpha r}(1-\\theta) \\\\\nk_{\\mathrm{rec}} & -\\,k_{\\mathrm{rel}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nWe can simplify the entries of the Jacobian by substituting the steady-state condition $ k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,e^{-\\alpha r^\\ast}(1-\\theta^\\ast) = k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\theta^\\ast $.\n\nFor the top-right entry, $ J_{12} $:\n$$\nJ_{12}(\\theta^\\ast, r^\\ast) = -\\alpha\\,k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,e^{-\\alpha r^\\ast}(1-\\theta^\\ast) = -\\alpha (k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\theta^\\ast)\n$$\nFor the top-left entry, $ J_{11} $:\nFirst, express $ k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,e^{-\\alpha r^\\ast} $ from the steady-state equation:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,e^{-\\alpha r^\\ast} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\theta^\\ast}{1-\\theta^\\ast}\n$$\nNow substitute this into the expression for $ J_{11} $:\n$$\nJ_{11}(\\theta^\\ast, r^\\ast) = -\\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\theta^\\ast}{1-\\theta^\\ast}\\right) - k_{\\mathrm{des}} = -k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\left(\\frac{\\theta^\\ast}{1-\\theta^\\ast} + 1\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\left(\\frac{\\theta^\\ast + 1 - \\theta^\\ast}{1-\\theta^\\ast}\\right) = -\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}}{1-\\theta^\\ast}\n$$\nThe simplified Jacobian matrix at the steady state $ (\\theta^\\ast, r^\\ast) $ is:\n$$\nJ^\\ast =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}}{1-\\theta^\\ast} & -\\alpha\\,k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\theta^\\ast \\\\\nk_{\\mathrm{rec}} & -k_{\\mathrm{rel}}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis simplified form is computationally more efficient and robust as it avoids re-evaluating the exponential term and depends only on known rate constants and the numerically determined $ \\theta^\\ast $.\n\n**Step 3: Oscillation Criterion**\n\nThe eigenvalues $ \\lambda $ of a $ 2 \\times 2 $ matrix are the roots of the characteristic equation $ \\lambda^2 - t\\lambda + d = 0 $, where $ t = \\mathrm{tr}(J^\\ast) $ is the trace and $ d = \\det(J^\\ast) $ is the determinant.\nThe solutions are $ \\lambda = \\frac{t \\pm \\sqrt{t^2 - 4d}}{2} $.\n\nThe system exhibits small-amplitude oscillations if and only if the eigenvalues are a pair of complex conjugates. This occurs when the discriminant of the characteristic equation is negative:\n$$\nt^2 - 4d < 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad t^2 < 4d\n$$\n\nThe trace $ t $ and determinant $ d $ of the simplified Jacobian $ J^\\ast $ are:\n$$\nt = \\mathrm{tr}(J^\\ast) = -\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}}{1-\\theta^\\ast} - k_{\\mathrm{rel}}\n$$\n$$\nd = \\det(J^\\ast) = \\left(-\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}}{1-\\theta^\\ast}\\right)(-k_{\\mathrm{rel}}) - (-\\alpha\\,k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\theta^\\ast)(k_{\\mathrm{rec}}) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}k_{\\mathrm{rel}}}{1-\\theta^\\ast} + \\alpha\\,k_{\\mathrm{des}}k_{\\mathrm{rec}}\\theta^\\ast\n$$\nSince all parameters are positive and $ \\theta^\\ast \\in (0, 1) $, it is clear that $ t < 0 $ and $ d > 0 $. The condition $ t < 0 $ ensures that the steady state is always stable (damped response), meaning any oscillations will decay over time. Our task is solely to determine the presence of these oscillations, which is governed by the $ t^2 < 4d $ inequality.\n\n**Step 4: Algorithm**\n\nFor each parameter set $ (k_{\\mathrm{ads}}, s_0, \\alpha, p, k_{\\mathrm{des}}, k_{\\mathrm{rec}}, k_{\\mathrm{rel}}) $:\n1.  Define the function $ f(\\theta) = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,s_0\\,p\\,\\exp(-\\alpha (k_{\\mathrm{rec}}/k_{\\mathrm{rel}})\\theta)(1-\\theta) - k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\theta $.\n2.  Find the root $ \\theta^\\ast $ of $ f(\\theta) = 0 $ within the interval $ (0, 1) $ using a numerical solver.\n3.  Calculate the trace $ t = -\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}}{1-\\theta^\\ast} - k_{\\mathrm{rel}} $.\n4.  Calculate the determinant $ d = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}k_{\\mathrm{rel}}}{1-\\theta^\\ast} + \\alpha\\,k_{\\mathrm{des}}k_{\\mathrm{rec}}\\theta^\\ast $.\n5.  Evaluate the boolean expression $ t^2 < 4d $. Return `True` if oscillations are present, `False` otherwise.\nThis procedure will be applied to each of the four test cases provided.",
