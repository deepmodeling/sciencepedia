            "problem": "Consider a perfectly uniform catalytic surface with a single kind of adsorption site, denoted by the vacant site symbol $*$. Two gas-phase species, $A$ and $B$, competitively adsorb via the elementary equilibria $A(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$ and $B(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons B*$. Assume the following physically grounded conditions: ideal gas behavior in the gas phase, a thermodynamically ideal adsorbed lattice without lateral interactions or multisite occupancy, and a well-mixed, isothermal environment so that adsorption equilibria are established. Let $p_A$ and $p_B$ denote the partial pressures of $A$ and $B$, respectively, and let $\\theta_A$, $\\theta_B$, and $\\theta_*$ denote the fractional coverages of $A*$, $B*$, and vacant sites, respectively, on the surface. The site balance is $ \\theta_A + \\theta_B + \\theta_* = 1$.\n\nDefine the adsorption equilibrium constants $K_A$ and $K_B$ with units of inverse pressure, consistent with $p_A$ and $p_B$ expressed in the same pressure units, by the ideal-activity mass-action relationships implied by adsorption thermodynamics. Specifically, under the ideal assumptions stated above and a standard pressure $p^{0}$, the dimensionless mass-action constants satisfy $K_A^{\\mathrm{(dimless)}} = (\\theta_A/\\theta_*)(p^{0}/p_A)$ and $K_B^{\\mathrm{(dimless)}} = (\\theta_B/\\theta_*)(p^{0}/p_B)$. For convenience in engineering calculations, define $K_A \\equiv K_A^{\\mathrm{(dimless)}}/p^{0}$ and $K_B \\equiv K_B^{\\mathrm{(dimless)}}/p^{0}$, which therefore have units of inverse pressure.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental site balance and the ideal mass-action definitions above, derive closed-form analytical expressions for the competitive coverages $\\theta_A(p_A,p_B)$ and $\\theta_B(p_A,p_B)$ on the single type of site. Then, for the specific case $K_A = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$, $K_B = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$, $p_A = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, and $p_B = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, compute the numerical values of $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$. Round your numerical answers to four significant figures. Express the final coverages as dimensionless fractions (no units). Ensure that any intermediate dimensional parameters use bar as the pressure unit so that the products $K_A p_A$ and $K_B p_B$ are dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the competitive Langmuir adsorption isotherms for two species, $A$ and $B$, on a uniform surface, followed by a numerical calculation for specific conditions. The derivation proceeds from the fundamental principles of adsorption equilibrium and site conservation.\n\nThe problem statement provides the definitions for the adsorption equilibrium constants, $K_A$ and $K_B$, which have units of inverse pressure. These definitions are consistent with the mass-action relationships for the adsorption equilibria $A(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons A*$ and $B(\\mathrm{g}) + * \\rightleftharpoons B*$. The relationships are:\n$$K_A = \\frac{\\theta_A}{p_A \\theta_*}$$\n$$K_B = \\frac{\\theta_B}{p_B \\theta_*}$$\nHere, $\\theta_A$, $\\theta_B$, and $\\theta_*$ represent the fractional coverages of sites occupied by species $A$, species $B$, and vacant sites ($*$), respectively. The partial pressures of the gas-phase species are denoted by $p_A$ and $p_B$.\n\nFrom these equilibrium expressions, we can express the coverages of the adsorbed species, $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$, in terms of the vacant site coverage, $\\theta_*$, and the partial pressures:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_*$$\n$$\\theta_B = K_B p_B \\theta_*$$\n\nThe total number of available sites on the catalytic surface is conserved. Therefore, the sum of the fractional coverages of all entities on the surface must be equal to $1$. This is described by the site balance equation:\n$$\\theta_A + \\theta_B + \\theta_* = 1$$\n\nTo derive expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ that are independent of the unknown vacant site coverage $\\theta_*$, we substitute the expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ from the equilibrium relations into the site balance equation:\n$$(K_A p_A \\theta_*) + (K_B p_B \\theta_*) + \\theta_* = 1$$\n\nWe can then solve this algebraic equation for $\\theta_*$. Factoring $\\theta_*$ from each term on the left-hand side yields:\n$$\\theta_* (K_A p_A + K_B p_B + 1) = 1$$\nIsolating $\\theta_*$ gives the expression for the fractional coverage of vacant sites:\n$$\\theta_* = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\n\nWith this explicit expression for $\\theta_*$, we can now determine the final closed-form analytical expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$. We substitute the expression for $\\theta_*$ back into the rearranged equilibrium relations:\nFor the coverage of species $A$, $\\theta_A$:\n$$\\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_* = K_A p_A \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\right)$$\nThis yields the final expression for $\\theta_A(p_A, p_B)$:\n$$\\theta_A(p_A, p_B) = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\nSimilarly, for the coverage of species $B$, $\\theta_B$:\n$$\\theta_B = K_B p_B \\theta_* = K_B p_B \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\right)$$\nThis yields the final expression for $\\theta_B(p_A, p_B)$:\n$$\\theta_B(p_A, p_B) = \\frac{K_B p_B}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B}$$\nThese two equations represent the competitive Langmuir adsorption isotherms for species $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the numerical values of these coverages using the provided data:\n$K_A = 4.0~\\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$\n$K_B = 0.5~\\mathrm{bar}^{-1}$\n$p_A = 0.20~\\mathrm{bar}$\n$p_B = 0.80~\\mathrm{bar}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless products $K_A p_A$ and $K_B p_B$. The problem ensures the pressure units are consistent such that these products are dimensionless.\n$$K_A p_A = (4.0) \\times (0.20) = 0.80$$\n$$K_B p_B = (0.5) \\times (0.80) = 0.40$$\nNext, we calculate the value of the denominator term, which appears in both isotherm expressions:\n$$1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B = 1 + 0.80 + 0.40 = 2.20$$\nNow we can compute the numerical values of the fractional coverages, $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$:\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} = \\frac{0.80}{2.20} = \\frac{8}{22} = \\frac{4}{11}$$\n$$\\theta_B = \\frac{K_B p_B}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} = \\frac{0.40}{2.20} = \\frac{4}{22} = \\frac{2}{11}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final numerical answers to be rounded to four significant figures.\nFor $\\theta_A$:\n$$\\theta_A = \\frac{4}{11} \\approx 0.363636... \\approx 0.3636$$\nFor $\\theta_B$:\n$$\\theta_B = \\frac{2}{11} \\approx 0.181818... \\approx 0.1818$$\nThese values represent the fractional surface coverages of species $A$ and $B$, respectively, under the specified conditions.",

Thus, $E_2 = \\max\\{0.9, 0\\} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.0}{0.051704}\\right) = 1.0 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $k_2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.9}{0.051704}\\right) \\approx 2.495 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n5.  $r = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\approx k_2 \\approx 2.495 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, since $k_1 \\gg k_2$.\n\n**Case 2: $\\Delta E = -0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\n1.  $E_1 = \\max\\{0.4 + 0.5(-0.5), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.15, 0\\} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n2.  $E_2 = \\max\\{0.4 - 0.5(-0.5), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.65, 0\\} = 0.65\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.15}{0.051704}\\right) \\approx 5.498 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $k_2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.65}{0.051704}\\right) \\approx 3.475 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n5.  $r = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\approx k_2 \\approx 3.475 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, since $k_1 \\gg k_2$.\n\n**Case 3: $\\Delta E = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\nThis corresponds to the apex of the volcano plot, where the system is thermoneutral and maximally active.\n1.  $E_1 = \\max\\{0.4, 0\\} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n2.  $E_2 = \\max\\{0.4, 0\\} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 = k_2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.4}{0.051704}\\right) \\approx 4.370 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $r = \\frac{k_1 \\cdot k_1}{k_1 + k_1} = \\frac{k_1}{2} \\approx 2.185 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\n**Case 4: $\\Delta E = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\nBy symmetry, $E_1(0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = E_2(-0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV})$ and $E_2(0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = E_1(-0.5\\,\\mathrm{eV})$.\n1.  $E_1 = \\max\\{0.4 + 0.5(0.5), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.65, 0\\} = 0.65\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n2.  $E_2 = \\max\\{0.4 - 0.5(0.5), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.15, 0\\} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 \\approx 3.475 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $k_2 \\approx 5.498 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n5.  $r = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\approx k_1 \\approx 3.475 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, since $k_2 \\gg k_1$.\n\n**Case 5: $\\Delta E = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$**\nBy symmetry, $E_1(1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = E_2(-1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV})$ and $E_2(1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = E_1(-1.0\\,\\mathrm{eV})$.\n1.  $E_1 = \\max\\{0.4 + 0.5(1.0), 0\\} = \\max\\{0.9, 0\\} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n2.  $E_2 = \\max\\{0.4 - 0.5(1.0), 0\\} = \\max\\{-0.1, 0\\} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n3.  $k_1 \\approx 2.495 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n4.  $k_2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n5.  $r = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2} \\approx k_1 \\approx 2.495 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, since $k_2 \\gg k_1$.\n\nThe results illustrate the characteristic volcano-shaped dependence of the catalytic rate on the descriptor $\\Delta E$. The rate is low for very negative $\\Delta E$ (strong binding, high barrier for product release) and for very positive $\\Delta E$ (weak binding, high barrier for reactant activation). The maximum rate is achieved at $\\Delta E=0$, where the barriers for both steps are balanced.",
