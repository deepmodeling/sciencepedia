            "problem": "A gas-phase adsorbate $A$ interacts with a catalytically active surface comprised of a large number of identical and non-interacting sites at temperature $T$. Assume monolayer adsorption, negligible lateral interactions, and ideal gas behavior. Let the fractional surface coverage be $\\theta$, so that site conservation implies $\\theta + \\theta_{\\mathrm{vac}} = 1$, where $\\theta_{\\mathrm{vac}}$ is the fraction of vacant sites. Under isothermal and isobaric conditions, model adsorption and desorption as elementary steps with mass-action kinetics:\n- Adsorption rate: $r_{\\mathrm{ads}} = k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p\\,(1-\\theta)$.\n- Desorption rate: $r_{\\mathrm{des}} = k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta$.\nHere, $p$ is the gas-phase pressure of $A$, and $k_{\\mathrm{ads}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ are temperature-dependent rate coefficients.

It describes the Langmuir adsorption model, a cornerstone of surface science and heterogeneous catalysis. The rate expressions for adsorption and desorption are based on the law of mass action, a fundamental principle of chemical kinetics. The adsorption rate is proportional to the partial pressure of the adsorbate $p$ and the fraction of available vacant sites $(1-\\theta)$, while the desorption rate is proportional to the fraction of occupied sites $\\theta$. All assumptions (monolayer adsorption, identical sites, no lateral interactions) are the standard idealizations for the elementary Langmuir model. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, relationships, and numerical values to derive the requested quantities. The setup is internally consistent and objective. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Adsorption Isotherm**\nThe derivation begins with the principle of dynamic equilibrium, where the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption.\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{ads}} = r_{\\mathrm{des}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given rate expressions:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p\\,(1-\\theta) = k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta\n$$\nOur goal is to solve this equation for the fractional coverage $\\theta$. We expand the left-hand side:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p - k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p\\,\\theta = k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta\n$$\nNext, we rearrange the equation to group all terms containing $\\theta$ on one side:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p = k_{\\mathrm{des}}\\,\\theta + k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p\\,\\theta\n$$\nFactoring out $\\theta$ from the right-hand side gives:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p = \\theta (k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p)\n$$\nIsolating $\\theta$ yields:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p}{k_{\\mathrm{des}} + k_{\\mathrm{ads}}\\,p}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of the equilibrium constant $K \\equiv k_{\\mathrm{ads}}/k_{\\mathrm{des}}$, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the desorption rate coefficient $k_{\\mathrm{des}}$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ads}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}}}\\,p}{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{des}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}}} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ads}}}{k_{\\mathrm{des}}}\\,p}\n$$\nSubstituting $K$ for $k_{\\mathrm{ads}}/k_{\\mathrm{des}}$ and simplifying, we arrive at the Langmuir adsorption isotherm:\n$$\n\\theta(p, K) = \\frac{K\\,p}{1 + K\\,p}\n$$\n\n**Evaluation of Fractional Coverage $\\theta$**\nWe are given $K = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{bar^{-1}}$. We now evaluate $\\theta$ for the specified pressures.\n\n1.  At $p = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{bar}$:\n    $$\n    \\theta(0.1) = \\frac{(0.2)(0.1)}{1 + (0.2)(0.1)} = \\frac{0.02}{1 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{1.02} = \\frac{2}{102} = \\frac{1}{51}\n    $$\n2.  At $p = 1\\,\\mathrm{bar}$:\n    $$\n    \\theta(1) = \\frac{(0.2)(1)}{1 + (0.2)(1)} = \\frac{0.2}{1 + 0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{1.2} = \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{1}{6}\n    $$\n3.  At $p = 10\\,\\mathrm{bar}$:\n    $$\n    \\theta(10) = \\frac{(0.2)(10)}{1 + (0.2)(10)} = \\frac{2}{1 + 2} = \\frac{2}{3}\n    $$\n\n**Determination of the Half-Coverage Pressure $p_{1/2}$**\nThe half-coverage pressure $p_{1/2}$ is defined as the pressure at which $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$. We use the derived isotherm expression:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K\\,p_{1/2}}{1 + K\\,p_{1/2}}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $2(1 + K\\,p_{1/2})$ gives:\n$$\n1 + K\\,p_{1/2} = 2\\,K\\,p_{1/2}\n$$\nSubtracting $K\\,p_{1/2}$ from both sides yields:\n$$\n1 = K\\,p_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for $p_{1/2}$ gives a general relationship:\n$$\np_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{K}\n$$\nUsing the given value $K = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{bar^{-1}}$:\n$$\np_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{bar^{-1}}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{bar}\n$$\n\n**Comment on Saturation Behavior**\nThe derived expression for fractional coverage is $\\theta = \\frac{K\\,p}{1 + K\\,p}$. To analyze the behavior as pressure $p$ increases, we examine the limit of $\\theta$ as $p \\rightarrow \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{p \\to \\infty} \\theta(p) = \\lim_{p \\to \\infty} \\frac{K\\,p}{1 + K\\,p}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $p$:\n$$\n\\lim_{p \\to \\infty} \\frac{K}{\\frac{1}{p} + K} = \\frac{K}{0 + K} = 1\n$$\nThis limit shows that as the pressure becomes very large, the fractional coverage $\\theta$ approaches $1$. This corresponds to a state of saturation, where nearly all available adsorption sites on the surface are occupied. The computed values are consistent with this behavior: as $p$ increases from $0.1\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ to $1\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ to $10\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $\\theta$ increases from $\\frac{1}{51}$ (approximately $0.02$) to $\\frac{1}{6}$ (approximately $0.167$) to $\\frac{2}{3}$ (approximately $0.667$), progressively approaching saturation.\n\nThe final numerical results for the tuple $\\big(\\theta(0.1\\,\\mathrm{bar}),\\,\\theta(1\\,\\mathrm{bar}),\\,\\theta(10\\,\\mathrm{bar}),\\,p_{1/2}\\big)$ are $(\\frac{1}{51}, \\frac{1}{6}, \\frac{2}{3}, 5\\,\\mathrm{bar})$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in deriving and applying the competitive Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, a fundamental concept in surface science and heterogeneous catalysis. The assumptions provided—(i) elementary, quasi-equilibrated adsorption, (ii) no lateral interactions, (iii) a fixed total number of sites governed by a site balance, and (iv) ideal gas behavior—are the standard postulates for this model. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters are provided for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin the derivation by considering the elementary adsorption-desorption processes for each species, $A$ and $B$, on a single type of surface site, designated by $*$. The reactions are given as:\n$A(\\mathrm{g})+*(\\mathrm{s}) \\rightleftharpoons A*(\\mathrm{s})$\n$B(\\mathrm{g})+*(\\mathrm{s}) \\rightleftharpoons B*(\\mathrm{s})$\n\nLet $\\theta_A$ be the fractional surface coverage of species $A$, $\\theta_B$ be the fractional coverage of species $B$, and $\\theta_*$ be the fraction of vacant sites. The rates of adsorption ($r_{\\text{ads}}$) are proportional to the partial pressure of the adsorbing species in the gas phase and the fraction of available vacant sites. The rates of desorption ($r_{\\text{des}}$) are proportional to the fraction of sites occupied by that species.\n\nFor species $A$, the forward (adsorption) and reverse (desorption) rates are:\n$$ r_{\\text{ads},A} = k_{\\text{ads},A} p_A \\theta_* $$\n$$ r_{\\text{des},A} = k_{\\text{des},A} \\theta_A $$\nwhere $k_{\\text{ads},A}$ and $k_{\\text{des},A}$ are the rate constants for adsorption and desorption of $A$, respectively, and $p_A$ is its partial pressure.\n\nThe problem states that the adsorption is quasi-equilibrated, which means the net rate of adsorption is zero, or equivalently, the forward rate equals the reverse rate:\n$$ r_{\\text{ads},A} = r_{\\text{des},A} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{ads},A} p_A \\theta_* = k_{\\text{des},A} \\theta_A $$\nWe can rearrange this to express $\\theta_A$ in terms of $\\theta_*$. The ratio of the rate constants defines the adsorption equilibrium constant, $K_A$:\n$$ K_A = \\frac{k_{\\text{ads},A}}{k_{\\text{des},A}} $$\nSubstituting this definition, we obtain the expression for $\\theta_A$:\n$$ \\theta_A = K_A p_A \\theta_* $$\n\nThis completes the first part of the derivation for species $A$. An identical procedure is followed for species $B$:\n$$ r_{\\text{ads},B} = k_{\\text{ads},B} p_B \\theta_* $$\n$$ r_{\\text{des},B} = k_{\\text{des},B} \\theta_B $$\nAt quasi-equilibrium, $r_{\\text{ads},B} = r_{\\text{des},B}$, leading to:\n$$ k_{\\text{ads},B} p_B \\theta_* = k_{\\text{des},B} \\theta_B $$\nDefining the equilibrium constant for $B$ as $K_B = k_{\\text{ads},B}/k_{\\text{des},B}$, we find:\n$$ \\theta_B = K_B p_B \\theta_* $$\nThese expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ are in terms of the system parameters and the fraction of empty sites, $\\theta_*$, as requested.\n\nNext, we eliminate $\\theta_*$ using the site balance. The sum of the fractional coverages of all species on the surface, including vacant sites, must equal unity:\n$$ \\theta_A + \\theta_B + \\theta_* = 1 $$\nWe substitute the equilibrium expressions for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ into the site balance equation:\n$$ (K_A p_A \\theta_*) + (K_B p_B \\theta_*) + \\theta_* = 1 $$\nFactoring out $\\theta_*$ from the left side gives:\n$$ \\theta_* (K_A p_A + K_B p_B + 1) = 1 $$\nSolving for the fraction of vacant sites, $\\theta_*$, we get:\n$$ \\theta_* = \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} $$\nNow we substitute this expression for $\\theta_*$ back into the equations for $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$ to obtain the final closed-form expressions that depend only on the given parameters:\n$$ \\theta_A = K_A p_A \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\right) = \\frac{K_A p_A}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} $$\n$$ \\theta_B = K_B p_B \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} \\right) = \\frac{K_B p_B}{1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B} $$\nThese are the competitive Langmuir adsorption isotherms for a binary mixture.\n\nNow we evaluate these expressions using the provided numerical values:\n$K_A = 1\\,\\mathrm{bar^{-1}}$\n$K_B = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{bar^{-1}}$\n$p_A = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{bar}$\n$p_B = 1\\,\\mathrm{bar}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless products $K_A p_A$ and $K_B p_B$, which represent the adsorption driving forces for each species:\n$K_A p_A = (1\\,\\mathrm{bar^{-1}}) \\times (0.5\\,\\mathrm{bar}) = 0.5$\n$K_B p_B = (0.1\\,\\mathrm{bar^{-1}}) \\times (1\\,\\mathrm{bar}) = 0.1$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, which is common to both expressions:\nDenominator $= 1 + K_A p_A + K_B p_B = 1 + 0.5 + 0.1 = 1.6$\n\nFinally, we calculate the fractional coverages:\n$$ \\theta_A = \\frac{0.5}{1.6} = 0.3125 $$\n$$ \\theta_B = \\frac{0.1}{1.6} = 0.0625 $$\nThe problem requires rounding each value to four significant figures. The value of $\\theta_A = 0.3125$ already has four significant figures. The value of $\\theta_B = 0.0625$ has two significant figures; to express it with four, we write it as $0.06250$.\n\nInterpretation:\nThe competition for surface sites is determined by both the intrinsic affinity of each species for the surface (quantified by $K_i$) and its availability in the gas phase (quantified by $p_i$). The relevant term for comparison is the product $K_i p_i$. Here, $K_A = 10 \\times K_B$, indicating that species $A$ has a tenfold stronger intrinsic binding affinity than species $B$. Although the partial pressure of $B$ is twice that of $A$ ($p_B = 2 \\times p_A$), the much stronger binding of $A$ dominates the competition. This is confirmed by comparing the products: $K_A p_A = 0.5$, which is five times larger than $K_B p_B = 0.1$. Consequently, the surface coverage of $A$ ($\\theta_A = 0.3125$) is five times greater than that of $B$ ($\\theta_B = 0.0625$). Therefore, under these conditions, species $A$ competitively displaces species $B$ from the surface due to its significantly higher adsorption equilibrium constant.",

It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution process involves two main steps: first, to derive the scalar nonlinear equation for the equilibrium surface coverage $\\theta$ from the provided fundamental principles, and second, to implement a numerical routine to solve this equation for each set of parameters.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Equilibrium Equation**\n\nThe condition for thermodynamic equilibrium between the gas phase and the adsorbed phase is the equality of their chemical potentials.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\theta, T) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}(p, T)\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the expressions for the chemical potential of the gas, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}$, and the adsorbed layer, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}(p,T) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}(T) + R T \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{p}{p^{0}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\theta,T) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}(T) + R T \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) + w\\,\\theta\n$$\nHere, $\\theta$ is the fractional surface coverage, $T$ is the temperature, $p$ is the pressure, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $w$ is the mean-field lateral interaction energy, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}(T)$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}(T)$ are the standard-state chemical potentials of the gas and adsorbate, respectively, and $p^0$ is the reference pressure.\n\nEquating the two expressions for chemical potential:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}(T) + R T \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) + w\\,\\theta = \\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}(T) + R T \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{p}{p^{0}}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo isolate the terms involving $\\theta$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\nR T \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) + w\\,\\theta = \\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}(T) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}(T) + R T \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{p}{p^{0}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNext, we divide the entire equation by $R T$:\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{w\\,\\theta}{R T} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}(T) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}(T)}{R T} + \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{p}{p^{0}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the equilibrium constant, $K$, as:\n$$\nK \\equiv \\dfrac{1}{p^{0}} \\exp\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}(T) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}(T)}{R T}\\right)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of this definition gives:\n$$\n\\ln(K) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{p^0}\\right) + \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}(T) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}(T)}{R T} = -\\ln(p^0) + \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}(T) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}(T)}{R T}\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the standard-state chemical potential difference term as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{0}(T) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}(T)}{R T} = \\ln(K) + \\ln(p^0) = \\ln(K p^0)\n$$\n\nSubstituting this back into our rearranged equilibrium equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{w\\,\\theta}{R T} = \\ln(K p^0) + \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{p}{p^{0}}\\right)\n$$\n\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a) + \\ln(b) = \\ln(ab)$, the right-hand side simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln(K p^0) + \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{p}{p^{0}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(K p^0 \\cdot \\frac{p}{p^0}\\right) = \\ln(K p)\n$$\n\nThis leads to the final form of the implicit equation for $\\theta$, known as the Frumkin-Fowler-Guggenheim isotherm equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{w\\,\\theta}{R T} = \\ln(K p)\n$$\nThis is the scalar nonlinear equation that must be solved for $\\theta$. To solve it numerically, we formulate it as a root-finding problem. We define a function $f(\\theta)$ such that we seek the root of $f(\\theta) = 0$:\n$$\nf(\\theta) = \\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) + \\frac{w\\,\\theta}{R T} - \\ln(K p) = 0\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Numerical Solution Strategy**\n\nThe unknown $\\theta$ is physically constrained to the open interval $(0, 1)$. We need to find the root of the function $f(\\theta)$ within this interval.\nLet's analyze the behavior of $f(\\theta)$ at the boundaries of its domain:\n- As $\\theta \\to 0^+$, the term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) \\to -\\infty$, so $f(\\theta) \\to -\\infty$.\n- As $\\theta \\to 1^-$, the term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) \\to +\\infty$, so $f(\\theta) \\to +\\infty$.\n\nSince the function $f(\\theta)$ is continuous on $(0, 1)$ and goes from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that at least one root exists in this interval. For the parameter ranges given, the function is also monotonic, ensuring a unique root.\n\nA suitable numerical method for this problem is a bracketing root-finding algorithm, such as the Brent-Dekker method (`brentq` in `scipy.optimize`). This method is robust as it requires finding an interval $[a, b]$ where $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs. Given the boundary behavior of $f(\\theta)$, we can choose $a$ to be a small positive number (e.g., $10^{-12}$) and $b$ to be a number slightly less than $1$ (e.g., $1 - 10^{-12}$), which will reliably bracket the root.\n\nThe implementation will iterate through each test case, define the function $f(\\theta)$ with the specific parameters $(K, w, T, p)$, and use `scipy.optimize.brentq` to find the unique root $\\theta \\in (0, 1)$. The interaction energy $w$ must be converted from $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ by multiplying by $1000$. The computed value of $\\theta$ for each case is then rounded to six decimal places for the final output.",
