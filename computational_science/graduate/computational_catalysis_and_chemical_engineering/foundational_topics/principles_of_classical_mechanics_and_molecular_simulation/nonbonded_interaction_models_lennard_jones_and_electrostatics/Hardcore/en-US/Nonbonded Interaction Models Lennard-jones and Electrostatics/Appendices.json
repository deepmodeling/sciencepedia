It is a standard, fundamental problem in physical chemistry and computational science. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the first principles as requested.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Equilibrium Separation, $r_{\\min}$**\n\nThe equilibrium separation, $r_{\\min}$, is the distance at which the potential energy $u(r)$ is at a minimum. At a minimum, the first derivative of the potential with respect to the separation distance is zero.\nThe potential energy function is:\n$$u(r) = 4\\epsilon \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6} \\right] = 4\\epsilon(\\sigma^{12}r^{-12} - \\sigma^{6}r^{-6})$$\nWe first compute the derivative of $u(r)$ with respect to $r$:\n$$\\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ 4\\epsilon(\\sigma^{12}r^{-12} - \\sigma^{6}r^{-6}) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{du}{dr} = 4\\epsilon(\\sigma^{12}(-12r^{-13}) - \\sigma^{6}(-6r^{-7}))$$\n$$\\frac{du}{dr} = 4\\epsilon(-12\\sigma^{12}r^{-13} + 6\\sigma^{6}r^{-7})$$\nSetting this derivative to zero defines the equilibrium distance $r_{\\min}$:\n$$4\\epsilon(-12\\sigma^{12}r_{\\min}^{-13} + 6\\sigma^{6}r_{\\min}^{-7}) = 0$$\nSince $4\\epsilon \\neq 0$, the term in the parentheses must be zero:\n$$12\\sigma^{12}r_{\\min}^{-13} = 6\\sigma^{6}r_{\\min}^{-7}$$\nAssuming $r_{\\min}  0$, we can rearrange the equation:\n$$\\frac{12\\sigma^{12}}{r_{\\min}^{13}} = \\frac{6\\sigma^{6}}{r_{\\min}^7}$$\n$$r_{\\min}^{6} = \\frac{12\\sigma^{12}}{6\\sigma^6} = 2\\sigma^6$$\nSolving for $r_{\\min}$ yields the symbolic expression for the equilibrium separation:\n$$r_{\\min} = (2\\sigma^6)^{1/6} = 2^{1/6}\\sigma$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Force, $F(r)$, and its Value at Equilibrium**\n\nThe force $F(r)$ is defined as the negative gradient of the potential energy. In one dimension, this is $F(r) = -\\frac{du}{dr}$. Using the expression for $\\frac{du}{dr}$ derived above:\n$$F(r) = - \\left[ 4\\epsilon(-12\\sigma^{12}r^{-13} + 6\\sigma^{6}r^{-7}) \\right]$$\n$$F(r) = 4\\epsilon(12\\sigma^{12}r^{-13} - 6\\sigma^{6}r^{-7})$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$F(r) = \\frac{24\\epsilon}{r} \\left[ 2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6} \\right]$$\nBy the definition of equilibrium, the force at the equilibrium separation $r_{\\min}$ must be zero. This is because $r_{\\min}$ is the point where $\\frac{du}{dr} = 0$, and thus $F(r_{\\min}) = -\\frac{du}{dr}\\big|_{r=r_{\\min}} = 0$.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Curvature at Equilibrium, $\\frac{d^{2}u}{dr^{2}}\\big|_{r=r_{\\min}}$**\n\nThe curvature of the potential energy function is its second derivative, $\\frac{d^{2}u}{dr^{2}}$. This quantity is related to the vibrational frequency of the bond (or interaction) in a harmonic approximation. We differentiate $\\frac{du}{dr}$:\n$$\\frac{du}{dr} = 4\\epsilon(-12\\sigma^{12}r^{-13} + 6\\sigma^{6}r^{-7})$$\n$$\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ 4\\epsilon(-12\\sigma^{12}r^{-13} + 6\\sigma^{6}r^{-7}) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} = 4\\epsilon(-12\\sigma^{12}(-13r^{-14}) + 6\\sigma^{6}(-7r^{-8}))$$\n$$\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} = 4\\epsilon(156\\sigma^{12}r^{-14} - 42\\sigma^{6}r^{-8})$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression at the equilibrium separation $r = r_{\\min} = 2^{1/6}\\sigma$. It is computationally simpler to use the relation $r_{\\min}^6 = 2\\sigma^6$.\n$$\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}\\bigg|_{r=r_{\\min}} = 4\\epsilon \\left( \\frac{156\\sigma^{12}}{r_{\\min}^{14}} - \\frac{42\\sigma^6}{r_{\\min}^8} \\right)$$\n$$= 4\\epsilon \\left( \\frac{156\\sigma^{12}}{(r_{\\min}^6)^{14/6}} - \\frac{42\\sigma^6}{(r_{\\min}^6)^{8/6}} \\right) = 4\\epsilon \\left( \\frac{156\\sigma^{12}}{(2\\sigma^6)^{7/3}} - \\frac{42\\sigma^6}{(2\\sigma^6)^{4/3}} \\right)$$\n$$= 4\\epsilon \\left( \\frac{156\\sigma^{12}}{2^{7/3}\\sigma^{14}} - \\frac{42\\sigma^6}{2^{4/3}\\sigma^8} \\right) = \\frac{4\\epsilon}{\\sigma^2} \\left( \\frac{156}{2^{7/3}} - \\frac{42}{2^{4/3}} \\right)$$\nTo simplify the term in the parenthesis, we can write $2^{-7/3} = 2^{-1} \\cdot 2^{-4/3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2^{-4/3}$:\n$$= \\frac{4\\epsilon}{\\sigma^2} \\left( 156 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2^{-4/3} - 42 \\cdot 2^{-4/3} \\right) = \\frac{4\\epsilon}{\\sigma^2} \\left( 78 \\cdot 2^{-4/3} - 42 \\cdot 2^{-4/3} \\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{4\\epsilon}{\\sigma^2} (36 \\cdot 2^{-4/3}) = \\frac{144\\epsilon}{2^{4/3}\\sigma^2}$$\nSimplifying the powers of $2$: $144 = 36 \\times 4 = 36 \\times 2^2$.\n$$\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}\\bigg|_{r=r_{\\min}} = \\frac{36 \\cdot 2^2 \\epsilon}{2^{4/3}\\sigma^2} = 36 \\cdot 2^{(2-4/3)} \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sigma^2} = 36 \\cdot 2^{2/3} \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sigma^2}$$\nThe sign is positive, confirming that $r_{\\min}$ corresponds to a potential energy minimum.\n\n**4. Numerical Computations**\n\nGiven the parameters $\\epsilon = 0.997$ kJ/mol and $\\sigma = 3.405$ Å.\n\n-   **Equilibrium separation $r_{\\min}$**:\n    $$r_{\\min} = 2^{1/6}\\sigma = 2^{1/6} \\times 3.405 \\text{ Å} \\approx 1.12246 \\times 3.405 \\text{ Å} \\approx 3.82198 \\text{ Å}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $r_{\\min} = 3.822$ Å.\n\n-   **Force at equilibrium $F(r_{\\min})$**:\n    As derived from first principles, the force at the potential minimum is exactly zero.\n    $$F(r_{\\min}) = 0 \\text{ kJ/mol·Å}$$\n\n-   **Curvature at equilibrium $\\frac{d^{2}u}{dr^{2}}\\big|_{r=r_{\\min}}$**:\n    Using the symbolic expression derived above:\n    $$\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}\\bigg|_{r=r_{\\min}} = 36 \\cdot 2^{2/3} \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sigma^2} = 36 \\cdot 2^{2/3} \\frac{0.997 \\text{ kJ/mol}}{(3.405 \\text{ Å})^2}$$\n    $$2^{2/3} \\approx 1.587401$$\n    $$(3.405 \\text{ Å})^2 = 11.594025 \\text{ Å}^2$$\n    $$\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2}\\bigg|_{r=r_{\\min}} \\approx (36 \\times 1.587401) \\frac{0.997}{11.594025} \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{Å}^2}$$\n    $$\\approx 57.14644 \\times 0.0859925 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{Å}^2} \\approx 4.91410 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{Å}^2}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $\\frac{d^{2}u}{dr^{2}}\\big|_{r=r_{\\min}} = 4.914$ kJ/mol·Å$^{-2}$.\n\nThe final numerical answers are presented in the requested order $(r_{\\min}, F(r_{\\min}), d^{2}u/dr^{2}\\big|_{r=r_{\\min}})$.",

The relation is given as $F(r) = -\\frac{d u(r)}{d r}$.\n\nFirst, we write the Lennard-Jones potential in a form more amenable to differentiation:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = 4\\varepsilon\\left(\\sigma^{12}r^{-12} - \\sigma^{6}r^{-6}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we differentiate $u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)$ with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)}{d r} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ 4\\varepsilon\\left(\\sigma^{12}r^{-12} - \\sigma^{6}r^{-6}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)}{d r} = 4\\varepsilon \\left[ \\sigma^{12}(-12)r^{-13} - \\sigma^{6}(-6)r^{-7} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)}{d r} = 4\\varepsilon \\left[ -12\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{r^{13}} + 6\\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{r^{7}} \\right]\n$$\nThe force is the negative of this derivative:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = - \\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)}{d r} = -4\\varepsilon \\left[ -12\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{r^{13}} + 6\\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{r^{7}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = 4\\varepsilon \\left[ 12\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{r^{13}} - 6\\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{r^{7}} \\right]\n$$\nFactoring out common terms gives a more conventional form:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = \\frac{24\\varepsilon}{r} \\left[ 2\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6} \\right]\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Construct the modified potential $u_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r)$**\n\nTo ensure that both the potential and its first derivative (the force) are continuous and equal to zero at the cutoff distance $r_c$, we must modify the standard LJ potential. A general method is to add a polynomial correction term to the original potential for $r \\le r_c$. To satisfy two conditions (on the function and its first derivative), a linear correction term is insufficient; however, the problem asks for a potential that is shifted and has its force shifted. Let's construct a potential $u_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r)$ such that it satisfies the given boundary conditions. The standard procedure is to add a linear term to $u_{LJ}(r)$ and a constant, in the form $u_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r) = u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) + C_1 r + C_0$. Let's generalize this. We seek a potential of the form $u_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r) = u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) - V_{shift}(r)$. The conditions are $u_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r_c)=0$ and $\\left.\\frac{du_{\\mathrm{SF}}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c}=0$.\nThis leads to:\n$u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c) - V_{shift}(r_c) = 0$\n$\\left.\\frac{du_{\\mathrm{LJ}}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c} - \\left.\\frac{dV_{shift}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c} = 0$\nA simple polynomial that satisfies these constraints on $V_{shift}$ is a Taylor expansion of $u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)$ around $r_c$, truncated at the linear term.\nLet $V_{shift}(r) = u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c) + (r-r_c)\\left.\\frac{du_{\\mathrm{LJ}}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c}$.\nThis choice for $V_{shift}(r)$ satisfies $V_{shift}(r_c) = u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c)$ and $\\left.\\frac{dV_{shift}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c} = \\left.\\frac{du_{\\mathrm{LJ}}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c}$. Subtracting this from $u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)$ gives the desired properties.\n\nThus, the shifted-force potential $u_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r)$ is:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r) = u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) - \\left( u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c) + (r-r_c)\\left.\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c} \\right)\n$$\nThis form ensures by construction that at $r=r_c$:\n1. $u_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r_c) = u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c) - \\left( u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c) + (r_c-r_c)\\left.\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c} \\right) = u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c) - u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c) = 0$.\n2. $\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r)}{dr} = \\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)}{dr} - \\left.\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c}$. Evaluating at $r=r_c$ gives $\\left.\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{SF}}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c} = \\left.\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c} - \\left.\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c} = 0$.\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)$ and its derivative:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c) = 4\\varepsilon\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r_c}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r_c}\\right)^{6}\\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r)}{dr}\\right|_{r=r_c} = 4\\varepsilon \\left[ -12\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{r_c^{13}} + 6\\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{r_c^{7}} \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $u_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r)$ yields the final analytical form:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{SF}}(r) = 4\\varepsilon\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6}\\right] - 4\\varepsilon\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r_c}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r_c}\\right)^{6}\\right] - (r-r_c) \\left( 4\\varepsilon \\left[ -12\\frac{\\sigma^{12}}{r_c^{13}} + 6\\frac{\\sigma^{6}}{r_c^{7}} \\right] \\right)\n$$\n\n**Task 3: Discussion on Electrostatics vs. Lennard-Jones**\n\nThe necessity of enforcing force continuity (i.e., $\\frac{du}{dr} \\to 0$ at $r_c$) is far more critical for long-ranged electrostatic interactions than for short-ranged Lennard-Jones interactions. This arises from the fundamental difference in how their respective potentials and forces decay with distance.\n\n1.  **Decay Rates**: The LJ potential decays rapidly, approximately as $u_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) \\approx -4\\varepsilon(\\sigma/r)^6$ for large $r$. The force decays even faster, $F_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) \\approx -24\\varepsilon\\sigma^6/r^7$. In contrast, the Coulomb potential decays very slowly as $u_{elec}(r) \\propto 1/r$, and its corresponding force decays as $F_{elec}(r) \\propto 1/r^2$. At a typical MD cutoff ($r_c \\approx 10-15$ Å), the magnitude of the LJ force and potential are negligible. However, the electrostatic force and potential remain significant.\n\n2.  **Consequences of Force Discontinuity**: If one simply truncates or even applies a simple potential shift ($u'_{shifted}(r) = u(r)-u(r_c)$), the potential becomes continuous at $r_c$, but the force remains discontinuous. The force $F(r) = -du'/dr = -du/dr$ abruptly drops from $F(r_c^{-})$ to $0$ for $r \\ge r_c$.\n    - For LJ, the force jump $F_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_c)$ is very small, leading to minor perturbations.\n    - For electrostatics, the force jump $F_{elec}(r_c)$ is substantial. This large discontinuity has severe physical and numerical consequences:\n        - **Violation of Energy Conservation**: As particles cross the cutoff boundary, they experience an impulsive change in force. This impulse performs work, leading to a systematic drift in the total energy of the system, typically observed as artificial heating. This makes long simulations in the microcanonical ($NVE$) ensemble unstable.\n        - **Violation of Momentum Conservation**: A discontinuous force breaks the symmetry of Newton's third law. A particle $i$ may exert a force on particle $j$ (if $r_{ij}  r_c$), while particle $j$ exerts no force back on $i$ if $i$ is outside $j$'s cutoff sphere but $j$ is inside $i$'s (a situation possible with neighbor listing). This leads to a net force on the center of mass and non-conservation of linear momentum.\n\n3.  **Physically Consistent Remedies for Electrostatics**: To handle long-range electrostatics accurately, methods that account for interactions beyond the cutoff are required.\n    - **Reaction Field (RF) Methods**: These methods are suitable for homogeneous, isotropic systems (like bulk liquids). The system within the cutoff sphere is treated explicitly, while the medium beyond $r_c$ is modeled as a continuous dielectric with a dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_{RF}$. Each pair of charges inside the sphere polarizes the surrounding dielectric, which in turn generates a \"reaction field\" that acts back on the charges. This adds a correction term to the pairwise Coulomb potential, effectively accounting for the mean influence of the long-range environment and ensuring the force is continuous (and often zero) at the cutoff boundary.\n    - **Ewald Summation Methods**: This is the benchmark for treating electrostatics under periodic boundary conditions (PBC), essential for simulations of crystals, surfaces, and solvated systems. The slowly converging $1/r$ sum is ingeniously split into two rapidly converging sums:\n        - A short-ranged, direct-space sum, which is truncated at $r_c$. This is achieved by adding a screening charge distribution (typically Gaussian) around each particle to screen its interaction.\n        - A long-ranged, reciprocal-space sum, which calculates the smooth part of the interaction using Fourier series. This sum is over the reciprocal lattice vectors of the simulation cell.\n    Modern algorithms like Particle-Mesh Ewald (PME) use Fast Fourier Transforms to make the reciprocal-space calculation highly efficient (scaling as $O(N\\log N)$), making it the standard for high-quality simulations involving ionic or polar species.\n\nIn summary, while simple truncation or shifting schemes may be acceptable for the rapidly decaying LJ potential, they are physically and numerically disastrous for the long-ranged electrostatic potential. The significant magnitude of the electrostatic force at typical cutoffs necessitates more sophisticated, physically-grounded methods like Reaction Field or Ewald summation to maintain energy conservation and simulation stability.",

            "problem": "Consider a small spherical ion being solvated in a polar solvent. In classical statistical mechanics, the Helmholtz free energy difference between two states is defined by the partition function and may be computed via a parameterization of the Hamiltonian. Let a coupling parameter $\\lambda$ be introduced to continuously couple nonbonded interactions between the solute and the solvent. For a path that decouples and then recouples interactions in two stages, first the van der Waals term using the Lennard-Jones model and second the electrostatic term using Coulombic interactions, Thermodynamic Integration (TI) defines the free energy contribution of each stage as the integral of the ensemble average of the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the corresponding coupling parameter. Specifically, for a Lennard-Jones stage with coupling parameter $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{LJ}}$ and a Coulombic stage with coupling parameter $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}$, the total solvation free energy is the sum of the two integrals,\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}} = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{LJ}})}{\\partial \\lambda_{\\mathrm{LJ}}} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{LJ}}} \\, d\\lambda_{\\mathrm{LJ}} \\;+\\; \\int_{0}^{1} \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U_{\\mathrm{C}}(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}})}{\\partial \\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}} \\, d\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}.\n$$\nThermodynamic Integration (TI) follows from the definition of the partition function, the relationship between the Helmholtz free energy and the partition function, and the chain rule applied to a parameterized Hamiltonian; you must begin from these fundamental bases without assuming any shortcut formulas beyond the definition above.\n\nYou are given discrete values of the coupling parameter and the corresponding ensemble averages of the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the coupling parameter.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and computational chemistry, specifically the method of Thermodynamic Integration (TI). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique numerical solution. The language is objective and the provided data are physically plausible. The task is to compute the solvation free energy for three distinct cases by numerically integrating discrete data representing the ensemble average of the derivative of the potential energy with respect to a coupling parameter.\n\nThe theoretical foundation of Thermodynamic Integration for calculating the Helmholtz free energy difference, $\\Delta A$, between two states (e.g., a decoupled state at $\\lambda=0$ and a fully coupled state at $\\lambda=1$) stems from fundamental statistical mechanics. The Helmholtz free energy $A$ is related to the canonical partition function $Q$ by:\n$$\nA = -k_B T \\ln Q\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature. The partition function $Q$ is an integral over all possible states (phase space $\\Gamma$) of the system:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{N!h^{3N}} \\int e^{-H(\\mathbf{r}^N, \\mathbf{p}^N)/(k_B T)} \\,d\\mathbf{r}^N d\\mathbf{p}^N\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian $H$ is the sum of kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $U$, $H=K+U$. When the potential energy is parameterized by a coupling parameter $\\lambda$, such that $U = U(\\lambda)$, the derivative of the free energy with respect to $\\lambda$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{d\\lambda} = -k_B T \\frac{1}{Q} \\frac{dQ}{d\\lambda}\n$$\nThe derivative of the partition function is:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\left( C \\int e^{-U(\\lambda)/(k_B T)} d\\Gamma \\right) = C \\int \\left( -\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\frac{\\partial U(\\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right) e^{-U(\\lambda)/(k_B T)} d\\Gamma\n$$\nwhere $C$ incorporates constants and the integral over kinetic energy terms. Substituting this back gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{d\\lambda} = -k_B T \\frac{1}{Q} \\left( C \\int \\left( -\\frac{1}{k_B T}\\frac{\\partial U(\\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right) e^{-U(\\lambda)/(k_B T)} d\\Gamma \\right) = \\frac{C \\int \\frac{\\partial U(\\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda} e^{-U(\\lambda)/(k_B T)} d\\Gamma}{C \\int e^{-U(\\lambda)/(k_B T)} d\\Gamma}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the definition of the ensemble average of $\\frac{\\partial U(\\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda}$ in the canonical ensemble at a specific $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{d\\lambda} = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U(\\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe total free energy change from $\\lambda=0$ to $\\lambda=1$ is obtained by integrating this derivative:\n$$\n\\Delta A = A(\\lambda=1) - A(\\lambda=0) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U(\\lambda)}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda} d\\lambda\n$$\nThis corresponds to the formula given in the problem statement, where $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{solv}}$ is used to denote the molar free energy of solvation. The process is applied separately to the Lennard-Jones ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{LJ}}$) and Coulombic ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{C}}$) contributions.\n\nTo compute the integrals numerically from discrete data points $(\\lambda_i, y_i)$, where $y_i = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial \\lambda} \\right\\rangle_{\\lambda_i}$, we must use a numerical quadrature method. The integral $\\int_{a}^{b} y(\\lambda) d\\lambda$ is the area under the curve of $y$ versus $\\lambda$. This area can be approximated by summing the areas of smaller shapes. The composite trapezoidal rule approximates the area by summing the areas of trapezoids formed between consecutive data points. For a set of $N+1$ points $(\\lambda_0, y_0), (\\lambda_1, y_1), \\dots, (\\lambda_N, y_N)$, the integral is approximated as:\n$$\n\\int_{\\lambda_0}^{\\lambda_N} y(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\frac{1}{2} (y_i + y_{i+1}) (\\lambda_{i+1} - \\lambda_i)\n$$\nThis method is robust for arbitrarily spaced samples and is suitable for the given problem. We will apply this rule to calculate $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{LJ}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{C}}$ for each case.
