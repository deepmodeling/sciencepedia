A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the small-argument asymptotic behavior of the spherical Bessel functions $j_{\\ell}(x)$ and $y_{\\ell}(x)$, an analysis of their regularity at the origin and its physical implications, and the calculation of the constant $S_{\\ell}$.\n\nWe begin with the spherical Bessel differential equation, obtained by setting $x = kr$ in the given radial equation:\n$$\nx^{2} f''(x) + 2 x f'(x) + \\left(x^{2} - \\ell(\\ell+1)\\right) f(x) = 0\n$$\nwhere $f(x)$ represents either $j_{\\ell}(x)$ or $y_{\\ell}(x)$. The standard method for finding solutions to such an equation is the method of Frobenius, which reveals two indicial roots at $s_{1} = \\ell$ and $s_{2} = -(\\ell+1)$. These roots correspond to two linearly independent solutions with leading behaviors of $x^{\\ell}$ and $x^{-(\\ell+1)}$ respectively. To find the correctly normalized asymptotic forms, we use the standard definitions of spherical Bessel functions in terms of the ordinary Bessel functions, $J_{\\nu}(x)$:\n$$\nj_{\\ell}(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2x}} J_{\\ell+1/2}(x)\n$$\n$$\ny_{\\ell}(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2x}} Y_{\\ell+1/2}(x) = (-1)^{\\ell+1} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2x}} J_{-(\\ell+1/2)}(x)\n$$\nThe second equality for $y_{\\ell}(x)$ uses the relation for Bessel functions of the second kind, $Y_{\\nu}(x)$, when the order $\\nu$ is a half-integer.\n\nThe defining series for the Bessel function of the first kind, $J_{\\nu}(x)$, is:\n$$\nJ_{\\nu}(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{m}}{m! \\Gamma(m+\\nu+1)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2m+\\nu}\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma$ is the Gamma function.\n\n**1. Asymptotic Behavior of $j_{\\ell}(x)$**\nTo find the small-argument behavior of $j_{\\ell}(x)$ as $x \\to 0^{+}$, we consider the leading term ($m=0$) of the series for $J_{\\ell+1/2}(x)$:\n$$\nJ_{\\ell+1/2}(x) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\ell+1/2+1)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{\\ell+1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\ell+3/2)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{\\ell+1/2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $j_{\\ell}(x)$:\n$$\nj_{\\ell}(x) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2x}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\ell+3/2)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{\\ell+1/2} \\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} x^{-1/2} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\ell+3/2)} \\frac{x^{\\ell+1/2}}{2^{\\ell+1/2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^{\\ell+1} \\Gamma(\\ell+3/2)} x^{\\ell}\n$$\nWe use the property of the Gamma function $\\Gamma(z+1) = z\\Gamma(z)$ and the value $\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$ to express $\\Gamma(\\ell+3/2)$ in terms of a double factorial:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\ell+3/2) = \\left(\\ell+\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\ell-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\cdots \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(2\\ell+1)(2\\ell-1)\\cdots 1}{2^{\\ell+1}} \\sqrt{\\pi} = \\frac{(2\\ell+1)!!}{2^{\\ell+1}} \\sqrt{\\pi}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $j_{\\ell}(x)$:\n$$\nj_{\\ell}(x) \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2^{\\ell+1}} \\frac{1}{\\frac{(2\\ell+1)!!}{2^{\\ell+1}} \\sqrt{\\pi}} x^{\\ell} = \\frac{x^{\\ell}}{(2\\ell+1)!!}\n$$\nThis is the leading small-argument asymptotic behavior of $j_{\\ell}(x)$.\n\n**2. Asymptotic Behavior of $y_{\\ell}(x)$**\nSimilarly, for $y_{\\ell}(x)$, we use the leading term of the series for $J_{-(\\ell+1/2)}(x)$:\n$$\nJ_{-(\\ell+1/2)}(x) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(-(\\ell+1/2)+1)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{-(\\ell+1/2)} = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1/2-\\ell)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{-(\\ell+1/2)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $y_{\\ell}(x)$:\n$$\ny_{\\ell}(x) \\sim (-1)^{\\ell+1} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2x}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1/2-\\ell)} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{-(\\ell+1/2)} \\right) = \\frac{(-1)^{\\ell+1} \\sqrt{\\pi} 2^{\\ell}}{\\Gamma(1/2-\\ell)} x^{-(\\ell+1)}\n$$\nUsing the reflection formula for the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$, with $z = \\ell+1/2$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\ell+1/2) \\Gamma(1/2-\\ell) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi(\\ell+1/2))} = \\frac{\\pi}{(-1)^{\\ell}}\n$$\nThus, $\\Gamma(1/2-\\ell) = \\frac{(-1)^{\\ell} \\pi}{\\Gamma(\\ell+1/2)}$. We know $\\Gamma(\\ell+1/2) = \\frac{(2\\ell-1)!!}{2^{\\ell}}\\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n$$\n\\Gamma(1/2-\\ell) = \\frac{(-1)^{\\ell} \\pi}{\\frac{(2\\ell-1)!!}{2^{\\ell}}\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{(-1)^{\\ell}\n\\sqrt{\\pi} 2^{\\ell}}{(2\\ell-1)!!}\n$$\nHere we use the convention that $(-1)!!=1$. Substituting this into the asymptotic expression for $y_{\\ell}(x)$:\n$$\ny_{\\ell}(x) \\sim \\frac{(-1)^{\\ell+1} \\sqrt{\\pi} 2^{\\ell}}{\\frac{(-1)^{\\ell} \\sqrt{\\pi} 2^{\\ell}}{(2\\ell-1)!!}} x^{-(\\ell+1)} = (-1) (2\\ell-1)!! x^{-(\\ell+1)}\n$$\nThis is the leading small-argument asymptotic behavior of $y_{\\ell}(x)$.\n\n**3. Regularity, Singularity, and Physical Admissibility**\nThe asymptotic forms are:\n$$\nj_{\\ell}(x) \\sim \\frac{x^{\\ell}}{(2\\ell+1)!!} \\quad \\text{as } x \\to 0^{+}\n$$\n$$\ny_{\\ell}(x) \\sim -(2\\ell-1)!! x^{-(\\ell+1)} \\quad \\text{as } x \\to 0^{+}\n$$\nFor any non-negative integer $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, the exponent $\\ell \\ge 0$. Thus, $j_{\\ell}(x)$ approaches a finite value as $x \\to 0$ ($j_0(0)=1$ and $j_{\\ell}(0)=0$ for $\\ell > 0$). This function is regular at the origin.\nFor any $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, the exponent $-(\\ell+1) \\le -1$. Thus, $|y_{\\ell}(x)| \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to 0$. This function is singular at the origin.\n\nIn a physical problem, the acoustic pressure field $p(\\mathbf{x}) = u_{\\ell}(r) Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta,\\phi)$ must remain finite everywhere in the domain of interest. If the domain includes the origin ($r=0$), any solution component that becomes infinite at the origin is physically inadmissible, as it would represent an infinite energy density. The general radial solution is a linear combination $u_{\\ell}(r) = A j_{\\ell}(kr) + B y_{\\ell}(kr)$. To ensure a finite pressure at $r=0$, the coefficient $B$ of the singular solution $y_{\\ell}(kr)$ must be zero. Therefore, for acoustic fields within a region containing the origin, only the regular solution $j_{\\ell}(kr)$ is physically admissible. The singular solution $y_{\\ell}(kr)$ is only valid in regions that exclude the origin, e.g., the exterior of a radiating object.\n\n**4. Calculation of $S_{\\ell}$**\nWe now compute the defined limit for $S_{\\ell}$:\n$$\nS_{\\ell} \\equiv \\lim_{x \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{1}{x^{2\\ell+1}} \\frac{j_{\\ell}(x)}{y_{\\ell}(x)}\n$$\nWe substitute the derived asymptotic expressions for $j_{\\ell}(x)$ and $y_{\\ell}(x)$ into the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{j_{\\ell}(x)}{y_{\\ell}(x)} \\sim \\frac{\\frac{x^{\\ell}}{(2\\ell+1)!!}}{-(2\\ell-1)!! x^{-(\\ell+1)}} = -\\frac{1}{(2\\ell+1)!! (2\\ell-1)!!} x^{\\ell - (-(\\ell+1))} = -\\frac{x^{2\\ell+1}}{(2\\ell+1)!! (2\\ell-1)!!}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the limit for $S_{\\ell}$:\n$$\nS_{\\ell} = \\lim_{x \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{1}{x^{2\\ell+1}} \\left( -\\frac{x^{2\\ell+1}}{(2\\ell+1)!! (2\\ell-1)!!} \\right)\n$$\nThe terms involving $x$ cancel out, leaving a constant:\n$$\nS_{\\ell} = -\\frac{1}{(2\\ell+1)!! (2\\ell-1)!!}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for $S_{\\ell}$ as a function of $\\ell$.",

This signifies a propagating wave where energy is equally partitioned between potential and kinetic forms, and energy flows outward without being locally stored.\n- In the near field ($kr \\ll 1$), the kinetic energy density $\\langle w_k \\rangle \\propto 1/r^4$ dominates the potential energy density $\\langle w_p \\rangle \\propto k^2/r^2$. Thus, $w_{\\mathrm{re}}(r) = \\langle w_p \\rangle - \\langle w_k \\rangle \\approx -\\langle w_k \\rangle$. The reactive energy is large and negative, indicating a dominance of kinetic energy.\nThis large kinetic energy corresponds to the \"sloshing\" motion of the fluid mass immediately surrounding the pulsating source. This motion does not efficiently create the compressions and rarefactions needed for propagation. Instead, it represents energy that is stored in the inertia of the fluid during one part of the cycle and returned to the source during another, much like the energy stored in the magnetic field of an inductor in an AC electrical circuit. This region of dominant stored kinetic energy is known as the reactive near field.",

By performing a plane wave analysis on a standard finite-difference scheme, you will learn how the discrete nature of a computational grid affects wave propagation speed, making it dependent on frequency and direction. This skill is indispensable for any computational acoustician seeking to develop or use accurate numerical models.",

On a uniform Cartesian grid with spatial steps $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ and time step $\\Delta t$, approximate the second derivatives by standard second-order centered finite differences in space and time. This leads to the explicit second-order finite difference scheme\n$$\\frac{p_{i,j}^{n+1} - 2 p_{i,j}^{n} + p_{i,j}^{n-1}}{\\Delta t^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{p_{i+1,j}^{n} - 2 p_{i,j}^{n} + p_{i-1,j}^{n}}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{p_{i,j+1}^{n} - 2 p_{i,j}^{n} + p_{i,j-1}^{n}}{\\Delta y^2} \\right),$$\nwhere $i$ and $j$ index the grid in space and $n$ indexes time.

For cases where a Courant number is specified, use the relation $\\Delta t = S \\Delta x / c$ for isotropic grids with $\\Delta x = \\Delta y$, and for anisotropic grids use $\\Delta t = S_x \\Delta x / c$ (which implies an effective $S_y = c \\Delta t / \\Delta y$).

The values must be dimensionless decimals (no percentage sign), in the order listed above.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive the discrete dispersion relation for a second-order finite-difference scheme for the two-dimensional linear acoustic wave equation and to use this relation to quantify the numerical phase speed error for a given set of parameters.\n\nThe starting point is the two-dimensional linear acoustic wave equation in a homogeneous, lossless medium:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\nwhere $p(x,y,t)$ is the acoustic pressure, and $c$ is the constant speed of sound. This equation is discretized on a uniform Cartesian grid with spatial steps $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$, and a time step $\\Delta t$. The pressure at grid point $(i\\Delta x, j\\Delta y)$ and time $n\\Delta t$ is denoted by $p_{i,j}^{n}$. Using second-order centered finite differences for all second derivatives, we obtain the explicit finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme:\n$$ \\frac{p_{i,j}^{n+1} - 2 p_{i,j}^{n} + p_{i,j}^{n-1}}{\\Delta t^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{p_{i+1,j}^{n} - 2 p_{i,j}^{n} + p_{i-1,j}^{n}}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{p_{i,j+1}^{n} - 2 p_{i,j}^{n} + p_{i,j-1}^{n}}{\\Delta y^2} \\right) $$\n\nTo perform a plane wave analysis (also known as von Neumann analysis), we substitute a discrete plane-wave solution, or ansatz, of the form\n$$ p_{i,j}^{n} = A \\exp\\left( \\mathrm{i} \\left( k_x i \\Delta x + k_y j \\Delta y - \\omega n \\Delta t \\right) \\right) $$\ninto the numerical scheme. Here, $A$ is a constant amplitude, $k_x$ and $k_y$ are the Cartesian components of the wavenumber vector $\\mathbf{k}$, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\mathrm{i}$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nSubstituting the ansatz requires evaluating the pressure at shifted grid points $(i\\pm 1, j, n)$, $(i, j\\pm 1, n)$, and $(i, j, n\\pm 1)$:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $p_{i,j}^{n\\pm 1} = p_{i,j}^{n} \\exp(\\mp \\mathrm{i} \\omega \\Delta t)$\n    \\item $p_{i\\pm 1,j}^{n} = p_{i,j}^{n} \\exp(\\pm \\mathrm{i} k_x \\Delta x)$\n    \\item $p_{i,j\\pm 1}^{n} = p_{i,j}^{n} \\exp(\\pm \\mathrm{i} k_y \\Delta y)$\n\\end{itemize}\nPlugging these into the FDTD scheme and dividing by the common non-zero factor $p_{i,j}^{n}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\exp(-\\mathrm{i} \\omega \\Delta t) - 2 + \\exp(\\mathrm{i} \\omega \\Delta t)}{\\Delta t^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{\\exp(\\mathrm{i} k_x \\Delta x) - 2 + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k_x \\Delta x)}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{\\exp(\\mathrm{i} k_y \\Delta y) - 2 + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i} k_y \\Delta y)}{\\Delta y^2} \\right) $$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\phi) + \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\phi) = 2 \\cos(\\phi)$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{2 \\cos(\\omega \\Delta t) - 2}{\\Delta t^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{2 \\cos(k_x \\Delta x) - 2}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{2 \\cos(k_y \\Delta y) - 2}{\\Delta y^2} \\right) $$\nNext, we employ the half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(\\phi) = 2 \\sin^2(\\phi/2)$:\n$$ \\frac{-4 \\sin^2(\\omega \\Delta t / 2)}{\\Delta t^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{-4 \\sin^2(k_x \\Delta x / 2)}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{-4 \\sin^2(k_y \\Delta y / 2)}{\\Delta y^2} \\right) $$\nCanceling the common factor of $-4$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2(\\omega \\Delta t / 2)}{\\Delta t^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sin^2(k_x \\Delta x / 2)}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{\\sin^2(k_y \\Delta y / 2)}{\\Delta y^2} \\right) $$\nTo solve for $\\omega$, we first isolate $\\sin(\\omega \\Delta t / 2)$. The problem specifies using the principal branch for $\\omega$, such that $0 \\le \\omega \\Delta t \\le \\pi$. This implies $0 \\le \\omega \\Delta t / 2 \\le \\pi/2$, for which $\\sin(\\omega \\Delta t / 2)$ is non-negative. Taking the positive square root:\n$$ \\sin(\\omega \\Delta t / 2) = c \\Delta t \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sin^2(k_x \\Delta x / 2)}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{\\sin^2(k_y \\Delta y / 2)}{\\Delta y^2} } $$\nApplying the arcsin function and solving for $\\omega$ gives the discrete dispersion relation:\n$$ \\omega(\\mathbf{k}) = \\frac{2}{\\Delta t} \\arcsin\\left( c \\Delta t \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sin^2(k_x \\Delta x / 2)}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{\\sin^2(k_y \\Delta y / 2)}{\\Delta y^2} } \\right) $$\nThis equation relates the numerical angular frequency $\\omega$ to the wavenumber components $k_x$ and $k_y$, and it differs from the continuous dispersion relation $\\omega = c k = c \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$. This difference is the source of numerical dispersion.\n\nThe numerical phase speed $c_{\\mathrm{num}}$ is defined as $\\omega/k$, where $k = |\\mathbf{k}| = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$. The relative phase speed error $\\varepsilon$ is then computed as:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{num}}}{c} - 1 = \\frac{\\omega(\\mathbf{k})}{c k} - 1 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$ \\varepsilon = \\frac{1}{c k} \\left[ \\frac{2}{\\Delta t} \\arcsin\\left( c \\Delta t \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sin^2(k_x \\Delta x / 2)}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{\\sin^2(k_y \\Delta y / 2)}{\\Delta y^2} } \\right) \\right] - 1 $$\nThe wavenumber components are related to the propagation angle $\\theta$ (measured from the $x$-axis) and magnitude $k$ by $k_x = k \\cos(\\theta)$ and $k_y = k \\sin(\\theta)$.\n\nFor implementation, the following steps are executed for each test case:\n1.  Obtain the parameters: $c, \\Delta x, \\Delta y, k, \\theta$, and the Courant number ($S$ or $S_x$).\n2.  Calculate the time step $\\Delta t$ using the provided Courant number definition. For isotropic grids ($\\Delta x = \\Delta y$), $\\Delta t = S \\Delta x / c$. For the anisotropic case, $\\Delta t = S_x \\Delta x / c$.\n3.  Calculate the wavenumber components $k_x = k \\cos(\\theta)$ and $k_y = k \\sin(\\theta)$.\n4.  Evaluate the argument of the arcsin function: $A = c \\Delta t \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sin^2(k_x \\Delta x / 2)}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{\\sin^2(k_y \\Delta y / 2)}{\\Delta y^2} }$.\n5.  Calculate the numerical angular frequency $\\omega = (2/\\Delta t) \\arcsin(A)$.\n6.  Calculate the numerical phase speed $c_{\\mathrm{num}} = \\omega / k$.\n7.  Compute the relative error $\\varepsilon = c_{\\mathrm{num}}/c - 1$.\nThe stability of this scheme is ensured by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which requires that the argument of the arcsin function be less than or equal to $1$ for all possible wavenumbers. This leads to the condition $c \\Delta t \\sqrt{1/\\Delta x^2 + 1/\\Delta y^2} \\le 1$. The Courant numbers in the test cases are chosen to satisfy this condition.",
