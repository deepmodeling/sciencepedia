            "problem": "A time-harmonic plane acoustic wave of angular frequency $\\omega$ propagates in the $+x$ direction in a lossless, homogeneous, inviscid fluid medium $1$ and is normally incident on a planar interface at $x=0$ with a second lossless, homogeneous, inviscid fluid medium $2$. The characteristic acoustic impedances of the two media are $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ (units Pa·s/m). Assume no interfacial mass, stiffness, or dissipation, and that the fields are strictly one-dimensional and time-harmonic with time dependence $\\exp(-i \\omega t)$.\n\nLet $p_i(x)$, $p_r(x)$, and $p_t(x)$ denote the complex pressure amplitudes of the incident, reflected, and transmitted plane waves, respectively. Define the complex pressure reflection coefficient $r$ and complex pressure transmission coefficient $t$ by $r := p_r(0)/p_i(0)$ and $t := p_t(0)/p_i(0)$.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in linear acoustics concerning wave reflection and transmission at a planar interface. All provided information is consistent and sufficient for a complete solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the pressure reflection and transmission coefficients, the intensity reflectance and transmittance, a proof of energy conservation, and a numerical calculation for specific impedance values.\n\nLet the interface between medium $1$ (for $x < 0$) and medium $2$ (for $x > 0$) be at $x=0$. The characteristic acoustic impedances are $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, which are real and positive for the specified lossless media. A time-harmonic plane wave with time dependence $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$ and angular frequency $\\omega$ propagates in the $+x$ direction in medium $1$.\n\nThe spatial complex pressure amplitude of the incident wave is denoted by $p_i(x)$. Since it propagates in the $+x$ direction, its form is $p_i(x) = p_i(0)\\exp(ik_1x)$, where $k_1$ is the wavenumber in medium $1$. The reflected wave propagates in the $-x$ direction, so its form is $p_r(x) = p_r(0)\\exp(-ik_1x)$. The transmitted wave propagates in the $+x$ direction in medium $2$, so its form is $p_t(x) = p_t(0)\\exp(ik_2x)$, where $k_2$ is the wavenumber in medium $2$.\n\nThe total pressure field $p(x)$ is:\nIn medium $1$ ($x<0$): $p_1(x) = p_i(x) + p_r(x) = p_i(0)\\exp(ik_1x) + p_r(0)\\exp(-ik_1x)$.\nIn medium $2$ ($x>0$): $p_2(x) = p_t(x) = p_t(0)\\exp(ik_2x)$.\n\nThe relationship between the complex pressure amplitude $p$ and the complex normal particle velocity amplitude $u_x$ for a plane wave is required. It stems from the one-dimensional linearized Euler's equation in the frequency domain: $-i\\omega \\rho u_x = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$, which gives $u_x(x) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$.\nFor a wave propagating in the $+x$ direction, $p(x) \\propto \\exp(ikx)$, so $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = ikp$. Thus, $u_x = \\frac{ik}{i\\omega\\rho}p = \\frac{k}{\\omega\\rho}p$. Using $k=\\omega/c$ and the definition of characteristic impedance $Z=\\rho c$, we get $u_x = \\frac{\\omega/c}{\\omega\\rho}p = \\frac{1}{\\rho c} p = \\frac{p}{Z}$.\nFor a wave propagating in the $-x$ direction, $p(x) \\propto \\exp(-ikx)$, so $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = -ikp$.

Dividing Equations 1 and 2 by $p_i(0)$:\n$1 + \\frac{p_r(0)}{p_i(0)} = \\frac{p_t(0)}{p_i(0)} \\implies 1 + r = t$ (Equation 1a)\n$\\frac{1}{Z_1}\\left(1 - \\frac{p_r(0)}{p_i(0)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{Z_2}\\frac{p_t(0)}{p_i(0)} \\implies \\frac{1-r}{Z_1} = \\frac{t}{Z_2}$ (Equation 2a)\n\nWe solve this system for $r$ and $t$. Substitute $t$ from Equation 1a into Equation 2a:\n$\\frac{1-r}{Z_1} = \\frac{1+r}{Z_2}$\n$Z_2(1-r) = Z_1(1+r)$\n$Z_2 - Z_2 r = Z_1 + Z_1 r$\n$Z_2 - Z_1 = r(Z_1 + Z_2)$\n$r = \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_1 + Z_2}$\n\nTo find $t$, substitute the expression for $r$ back into Equation 1a:\n$t = 1 + r = 1 + \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_1 + Z_2} = \\frac{(Z_1 + Z_2) + (Z_2 - Z_1)}{Z_1 + Z_2} = \\frac{2Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}$\n\nNext, we express the dimensionless intensity reflectance $R$ and transmittance $T$. The time-averaged intensity $I$ of a plane wave with complex pressure amplitude $P$ is $I = \\frac{|P|^2}{2Z}$.\nThe incident intensity is $I_i = \\frac{|p_i(0)|^2}{2Z_1}$.\nThe reflected intensity is $I_r = \\frac{|p_r(0)|^2}{2Z_1}$ (the reflected wave propagates in medium $1$).\nThe transmitted intensity is $I_t = \\frac{|p_t(0)|^2}{2Z_2}$ (the transmitted wave propagates in medium $2$).\n\nThe intensity reflectance $R$ is the ratio of reflected to incident intensity:\n$R = \\frac{I_r}{I_i} = \\frac{|p_r(0)|^2 / (2Z_1)}{|p_i(0)|^2 / (2Z_1)} = \\frac{|p_r(0)|^2}{|p_i(0)|^2} = \\left|\\frac{p_r(0)}{p_i(0)}\\right|^2 = |r|^2$.\n\nThe intensity transmittance $T$ is the ratio of transmitted to incident intensity:\n$T = \\frac{I_t}{I_i} = \\frac{|p_t(0)|^2 / (2Z_2)}{|p_i(0)|^2 / (2Z_1)} = \\frac{|p_t(0)|^2}{|p_i(0)|^2} \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\left|\\frac{p_t(0)}{p_i(0)}\\right|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = |t|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2}$.\n\nNow we demonstrate that $R+T=1$, which represents conservation of energy at the interface.\n$R = |r|^2 = \\left|\\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_1 + Z_2}\\right|^2 = \\frac{(Z_2 - Z_1)^2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2}$ since $Z_1, Z_2$ are real.\n$T = |t|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\left|\\frac{2Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}\\right|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\frac{4Z_2^2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2} \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = \\frac{4Z_1Z_2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2}$.\n\nSumming $R$ and $T$:\n$R+T = \\frac{(Z_2 - Z_1)^2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2} + \\frac{4Z_1Z_2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2} = \\frac{(Z_2 - Z_1)^2 + 4Z_1Z_2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2}$\nThe numerator is $(Z_2^2 - 2Z_1Z_2 + Z_1^2) + 4Z_1Z_2 = Z_1^2 + 2Z_1Z_2 + Z_2^2 = (Z_1 + Z_2)^2$.\nThus, $R+T = \\frac{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2}{(Z_1 + Z_2)^2} = 1$. This proves the conservation of energy flux.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values for $Z_1 = 1.5 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}·\\text{s}/\\text{m}$ and $Z_2 = 3.0 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{Pa}·\\text{s}/\\text{m}$.\n$r = \\frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_1 + Z_2} = \\frac{(3.0 - 1.5) \\times 10^6}{(1.5 + 3.0) \\times 10^6} = \\frac{1.5}{4.5} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nTo four significant figures, $r \\approx 0.3333$.\n\n$t = \\frac{2Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2} = \\frac{2 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^6)}{(1.5 + 3.0) \\times 10^6} = \\frac{6.0}{4.5} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\nTo four significant figures, $t \\approx 1.333$.\n\n$R = |r|^2 = (1/3)^2 = 1/9$.\nTo four significant figures, $R \\approx 0.1111$.\n\n$T = 1 - R = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9$.\nTo four significant figures, $T \\approx 0.8889$.\nLet's verify $T$ using its formula: $T = |t|^2 \\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = (4/3)^2 \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^6}{3.0 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{16}{9} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{8}{9}$.

Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem considers a time-harmonic plane acoustic wave propagating in the $-z$ direction in a lossless fluid, normally incident on a planar boundary at $z=0$. The complex pressure field $p(z)$ for $z>0$ is the superposition of the incident and reflected waves.\n\nThe incident wave, traveling in the $-z$ direction, has a complex pressure field of the form $p_i(z) = P_i e^{-ikz}$, where $P_i$ is the complex pressure amplitude at the boundary $z=0$ and $k=\\omega/c_0$ is the wavenumber.\nThe reflected wave, traveling in the $+z$ direction, has a complex pressure field of the form $p_r(z) = P_r e^{+ikz}$, where $P_r$ is the complex pressure amplitude of the reflected wave at the boundary $z=0$.\n\nThe total complex pressure field in the half-space $z>0$ is the linear superposition of these two waves:\n$$\np(z) = p_i(z) + p_r(z) = P_i e^{-ikz} + P_r e^{+ikz}\n$$\nThe complex pressure reflection coefficient $r$ is defined as the ratio of the complex amplitudes at the boundary, $r = P_r / P_i$. We can substitute $P_r = r P_i$ into the expression for the total pressure field:\n$$\np(z) = P_i e^{-ikz} + (r P_i) e^{+ikz} = P_i (e^{-ikz} + r e^{+ikz})\n$$\nWe are interested in the magnitude of this complex pressure field, $|p(z)|$.\n$$\n|p(z)| = |P_i (e^{-ikz} + r e^{+ikz})| = |P_i| |e^{-ikz} + r e^{+ikz}|\n$$\nTo find the standing-wave ratio ($\\mathrm{SWR}$), we must find the maximum and minimum values of $|p(z)|$ for $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{+}$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum and minimum values of the term $|e^{-ikz} + r e^{+ikz}|$.\n\nWe can determine these extrema by applying the triangle inequality to the sum of the two complex numbers, $e^{-ikz}$ and $r e^{+ikz}$.\nThe magnitude of the first term is $|e^{-ikz}|=1$ since $k$ and $z$ are real.\nThe magnitude of the second term is $|r e^{+ikz}| = |r||e^{+ikz}| = |r|$, since $|e^{+ikz}|=1$.\n\nThe maximum value of the sum is found when the two complex numbers are collinear and point in the same direction.

It is a standard problem in linear acoustics concerning wave reflection from an impedance boundary, extended to the modern concept of metasurfaces.\n\n**Part I: Reflection from a Uniform Impedance Boundary**\n\nWe begin by defining the geometry and the wave fields. The boundary is the plane $z=0$. The fluid medium $j$ with properties $\\rho_j$ and $c_j$ occupies the half-space $z>0$. An incident plane wave impinges on the boundary from this region. We can orient the coordinate system such that the plane of incidence is the $yz$-plane without loss of generality. The incident wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_i$ thus has no $x$-component. The angle of incidence $\\theta_i$ is measured from the normal $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. For a wave propagating from $z>0$ toward $z=0$, the $z$-component of its wavevector must be negative.\n\nThe incident wavevector is $\\mathbf{k}_i = k_{iy} \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + k_{iz} \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, where $k_{iy} = k_j \\sin\\theta_i$ and $k_{iz} = -k_j \\cos\\theta_i$, with $k_j = \\omega/c_j$ being the wavenumber in the medium.

The tangential component of the wavevector is conserved ($k_{ry} = k_{iy}$), and the normal component reverses sign. The reflected wavevector is $\\mathbf{k}_r = k_j \\sin\\theta_i \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} + k_j \\cos\\theta_i \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The reflected pressure field is $p_r(\\mathbf{r}) = P_r \\exp(i \\mathbf{k}_r \\cdot \\mathbf{r}) = P_r \\exp(i(k_j y \\sin\\theta_i + k_j z \\cos\\theta_i))$.\n\nThe total pressure field for $z>0$ is the superposition of the incident and reflected waves:\n$$p(y,z) = p_i(y,z) + p_r(y,z) = \\left[ P_i \\exp(-i k_j z \\cos\\theta_i) + P_r \\exp(i k_j z \\cos\\theta_i) \\right] \\exp(i k_j y \\sin\\theta_i)$$\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the linearized momentum balance, which for a time-harmonic field (with time-dependence $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$) is $\\rho_j (-i\\omega \\mathbf{v}) = -\\nabla p$.

Note that $v_n$ is specified as the velocity in the $+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ direction, so $v_n = v_z$.\nAt $z=0$, the total pressure and normal velocity become:\n$$p(y,0) = (P_i + P_r) \\exp(i k_j y \\sin\\theta_i)$$\n$$v_z(y,0) = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_i}{Z_j}(-P_i + P_r) \\exp(i k_j y \\sin\\theta_i)$$\nSubstituting these into the boundary condition:\n$$(P_i + P_r)\\exp(i k_j y \\sin\\theta_i) = -Z_s \\left( \\frac{\\cos\\theta_i}{Z_j}(-P_i + P_r) \\exp(i k_j y \\sin\\theta_i) \\right)$$\nThe exponential spatial dependence cancels out, leaving an algebraic relation for the amplitudes:\n$$P_i + P_r = \\frac{Z_s \\cos\\theta_i}{Z_j} (P_i - P_r)$$\nTo find the reflection coefficient $R(\\theta_i) = P_r/P_i$, we divide by $P_i$:\n$$1 + R(\\theta_i) = \\frac{Z_s \\cos\\theta_i}{Z_j} (1 - R(\\theta_i))$$\n$$1 + R(\\theta_i) = \\frac{Z_s \\cos\\theta_i}{Z_j} - R(\\theta_i) \\frac{Z_s \\cos\\theta_i}{Z_j}$$\nRearranging to solve for $R(\\theta_i)$:\n$$R(\\theta_i) \\left( 1 + \\frac{Z_s \\cos\\theta_i}{Z_j} \\right) = \\frac{Z_s \\cos\\theta_i}{Z_j} - 1$$\n$$R(\\theta_i) \\left( \\frac{Z_j + Z_s \\cos\\theta_i}{Z_j} \\right) = \\frac{Z_s \\cos\\theta_i - Z_j}{Z_j}$$\nThe complex pressure reflection coefficient is therefore:\n$$R(\\theta_i) = \\frac{Z_s \\cos\\theta_i - Z_j}{Z_s \\cos\\theta_i + Z_j}$$\n\n**Part II: Reflection from a Phase-Gradient Boundary**\n\nNow, the surface impedance $Z_s(y)$ varies along the $y$-direction. We employ the local plane-wave approximation, which assumes that at each point $(x,y,0)$, the reflection process is governed by the local impedance value $Z_s(y)$, as if it were a uniform infinite plane. The reflection coefficient thus becomes a function of position, $R(y)$. The relationship between the reflected and incident pressure fields on the surface is $p_r(x,y,0) = R(y) p_i(x,y,0)$.\n\nThe incident field on the surface $z=0$ is $p_i(x,y,0) = P_i \\exp(i(k_{ix}x + k_{iy}y))$. For incidence in the $yz$-plane, $k_{ix}=0$ and $k_{iy} = k_j \\sin\\theta_i$.\nThe reflection coefficient is given to have unit magnitude and a prescribed phase $\\phi(y)$, so $R(y) = \\exp(i\\phi(y))$.\nThe reflected pressure field at the boundary is:\n$$p_r(x,y,0) = \\exp(i\\phi(y)) \\left( P_i \\exp(i k_j y \\sin\\theta_i) \\right) = P_i \\exp\\left(i(k_j y \\sin\\theta_i + \\phi(y))\\right)$$\nThe phase of the reflected wave along the surface is $\\Phi_r(y) = k_j y \\sin\\theta_i + \\phi(y)$.\nThe tangential component of the reflected wavevector, $k_{ry}$, is given by the local spatial rate of change of the phase (the phase gradient). For a general surface phase $\\Phi_r(x,y)$, the tangential wavevector is $\\mathbf{k}_{r,t} = \\nabla_t \\Phi_r(x,y)$, where $\\nabla_t = \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$.\nIn our case, the phase varies only with $y$, so we only need the $y$-component:\n$$k_{ry} = \\frac{d\\Phi_r(y)}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left( k_j y \\sin\\theta_i + \\phi(y) \\right) = k_j \\sin\\theta_i + \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}$$\nThis equation shows that the phase gradient $\\partial\\phi/\\partial y$ adds to the tangential component of the incident wavevector to produce the tangential component of the reflected wavevector. This is a form of the generalized law of reflection.\n\nThe reflected wave propagates in the medium $j$, so its wavevector $\\mathbf{k}_r$ must have magnitude $k_j$. The reflection angle $\\theta_r$ is defined by the components of $\\mathbf{k}_r$, such that $k_{ry} = k_j \\sin\\theta_r$. Equating the two expressions for $k_{ry}$:\n$$k_j\\sin\\theta_r = k_j \\sin\\theta_i + \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}$$\nDividing by $k_j = \\omega/c_j$:\n$$\\sin\\theta_r = \\sin\\theta_i + \\frac{1}{k_j}\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y} = \\sin\\theta_i + \\frac{c_j}{\\omega}\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y}$$\nFor the specific linear phase profile $\\phi(y) = g y$, the phase gradient is a constant: $\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y} = g$. Substituting this into the equation for the reflection angle gives:\n$$\\sin\\theta_r = \\sin\\theta_i + \\frac{g c_j}{\\omega}$$\nSolving for $\\theta_r$ yields the closed-form expression for the reflection angle in radians:\n$$\\theta_r = \\arcsin\\left(\\sin\\theta_i + \\frac{g c_j}{\\omega}\\right)$$\nThis result describes anomalous reflection, where the angle of reflection is controlled by the engineered phase gradient $g$ on the surface.",
