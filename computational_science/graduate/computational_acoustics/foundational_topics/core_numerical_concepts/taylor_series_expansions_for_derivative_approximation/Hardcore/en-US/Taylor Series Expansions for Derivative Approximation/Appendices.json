The derivation must be founded on the Taylor series expansion of the function $f(x)$ about the point $x_i$.\n\nThe local truncation error, which we denote as $\\tau(x_i, h)$, is formally defined as the difference between the finite difference approximation applied to the exact function and the exact derivative it is intended to approximate. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\tau(x_i, h) = \\frac{f(x_i+h) - f(x_i-h)}{2h} - f'(x_i)\n$$\nTo analyze this expression, we invoke the Taylor series for $f(x)$ expanded about the point $x_i$. The problem premise of $f(x)$ being \"sufficiently smooth\" ensures the validity of this expansion. We expand $f(x_i+h)$ and $f(x_i-h)$ and denote the $n$-th derivative of $f(x)$ evaluated at $x_i$ as $f^{(n)}(x_i)$. For clarity, we also use the notation $f_i \\equiv f(x_i)$.\n\nThe Taylor series expansion for $f(x_i+h)$ is:\n$$\nf_{i+1} = f(x_i+h) = f(x_i) + h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{2!} f''(x_i) + \\frac{h^3}{3!} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^4}{4!} f^{(4)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^5}{5!} f^{(5)}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the factorials:\n$$\nf_{i+1} = f_i + h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''(x_i) + \\frac{h^3}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^5}{120} f^{(5)}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6)\n$$\nSimilarly, the Taylor series expansion for $f(x_i-h)$ is:\n$$\nf_{i-1} = f(x_i-h) = f(x_i) + (-h) f'(x_i) + \\frac{(-h)^2}{2!} f''(x_i) + \\frac{(-h)^3}{3!} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{(-h)^4}{4!} f^{(4)}(x_i) + \\frac{(-h)^5}{5!} f^{(5)}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6)\n$$\n$$\nf_{i-1} = f_i - h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''(x_i) - \\frac{h^3}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i) + \\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}(x_i) - \\frac{h^5}{120} f^{(5)}(x_i) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6)\n$$\nAs mandated by the problem, we now systematically demonstrate the cancellation of terms.

As $h \\to 0$, the term $\\frac{h^2}{6} f^{(3)}(x_i)$ is the dominant part of the error, assuming $f^{(3)}(x_i) \\neq 0$. The error is therefore proportional to $h^2$, which is written as $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. This means the central difference approximation is second-order accurate.\n\nThe leading-order truncation error term is the first non-zero term in the error series.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the three-point central-difference formula for the second derivative and the subsequent determination of its leading truncation error term. The derivation will be based on Taylor series expansions of a sufficiently smooth function $f(x)$ about a point $x_i$ on a uniform grid. The function $f(x)$ is assumed to possess at least four continuous derivatives in the neighborhood of $x_i$. The uniform grid is defined by points $x_i = x_0 + i h$, where $h > 0$ is the constant grid spacing.\n\nWe begin by writing the Taylor series expansions for $f(x_{i+1}) = f(x_i + h)$ and $f(x_{i-1}) = f(x_i - h)$ about the point $x_i$. The problem specifies that we should retain terms up to the fourth derivative. To determine the leading error term correctly, we will include the remainder term, which will involve derivatives of an order higher than four. A more direct approach is to use big O notation, which is standard practice for this type of derivation.\n\nThe Taylor series expansion for $f(x_i + h)$ is:\n$$f(x_{i+1}) = f(x_i) + h f'(x_i) + \\frac{h^2}{2!} f''(x_i) + \\frac{h^3}{3!} f'''(x_i) + \\frac{h^4}{4!} f^{(4)}(x_i) + O(h^5)$$\nUsing a more compact notation where $f_i = f(x_i)$, $f'_i = f'(x_i)$, and so on, this becomes:\n$$f_{i+1} = f_i + h f'_i + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''_i + \\frac{h^3}{6} f'''_i + \\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}_i + O(h^5) \\quad (1)$$\n\nSimilarly, the Taylor series expansion for $f(x_i - h)$ is:\n$$f(x_{i-1}) = f_i + (-h) f'_i + \\frac{(-h)^2}{2} f''_i + \\frac{(-h)^3}{6} f'''_i + \\frac{(-h)^4}{24} f^{(4)}_i + O((-h)^5)$$\n$$f_{i-1} = f_i - h f'_i + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''_i - \\frac{h^3}{6} f'''_i + \\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}_i + O(h^5) \\quad (2)$$\nNote that $O((-h)^5)$ is equivalent to $O(h^5)$ in this context, but writing out the negative sign is instructive.\n\nOur goal is to find an approximation for the second derivative, $f''_i$. Observing equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we see that the terms involving odd-order derivatives ($f'_i$, $f'''_i$) have opposite signs. Adding the two equations will thus eliminate these terms.\nAdding equation $(1)$ and equation $(2)$:\n$$f_{i+1} + f_{i-1} = (f_i + f_i) + (h f'_i - h f'_i) + \\left(\\frac{h^2}{2} f''_i + \\frac{h^2}{2} f''_i\\right) + \\left(\\frac{h^3}{6} f'''_i - \\frac{h^3}{6} f'''_i\\right) + \\left(\\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}_i + \\frac{h^4}{24} f^{(4)}_i\\right) + O(h^6)$$\nThe error terms must be handled with care. The fifth-order terms in the expansions are $\\frac{h^5}{120}f^{(5)}_i$ and $\\frac{(-h)^5}{120}f^{(5)}_i = -\\frac{h^5}{120}f^{(5)}_i$, respectively. Their sum is zero. Thus, the next non-zero term in the sum of the expansions involves $h^6$, and the remainder is of order $O(h^6)$.\nSumming the terms yields:\n$$f_{i+1} + f_{i-1} = 2f_i + h^2 f''_i + \\frac{2h^4}{24} f^{(4)}_i + O(h^6)$$\n$$f_{i+1} + f_{i-1} = 2f_i + h^2 f''_i + \\frac{h^4}{12} f^{(4)}_i + O(h^6)$$\n\nNow, we can rearrange this equation to solve for the second derivative, $f''_i$.\n$$h^2 f''_i = f_{i+1} - 2f_i + f_{i-1} - \\frac{h^4}{12} f^{(4)}_i - O(h^6)$$\nDividing by $h^2$:\n$$f''_i = \\frac{f_{i+1} - 2f_i + f_{i-1}}{h^2} - \\frac{h^2}{12} f^{(4)}_i - O(h^4)$$\n\nThis equation provides both the finite difference approximation and its error. The first part of the problem is to derive the approximation. By neglecting the terms involving $h$, we obtain the standard three-point central-difference approximation for the second derivative:\n$$f''(x_i) \\approx \\frac{f(x_{i+1}) - 2f(x_i) + f(x_{i-1})}{h^2}$$\n\nThe second part of the problem is to find the leading truncation error. The truncation error, $\\tau$, is defined as the difference between the finite difference approximation and the exact differential operator it approximates.\n$$\\tau = \\left( \\frac{f_{i+1} - 2f_i + f_{i-1}}{h^2} \\right) - f''_i$$\nFrom our rearranged equation for $f''_i$, we can directly find an expression for $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\left( f''_i + \\frac{h^2}{12} f^{(4)}_i + O(h^4) \\right) - f''_i$$\n$$\\tau = \\frac{h^2}{12} f^{(4)}_i + O(h^4)$$\n\nThe leading truncation error term is the term in the expansion of $\\tau$ with the lowest power of $h$. In this case, that term is $\\frac{h^2}{12} f^{(4)}(x_i)$. This indicates that the approximation is second-order accurate, as the error scales with $h^2$.

The Taylor series expansions for $f(x+h)$ and $f(x-h)$ about the point $x$ are:\n$$f(x+h) = f(x) + hf'(x) + \\frac{h^2}{2!}f''(x) + \\frac{h^3}{3!}f'''(x) + \\frac{h^4}{4!}f^{(4)}(x) + \\frac{h^5}{5!}f^{(5)}(x) + O(h^6)$$\n$$f(x-h) = f(x) - hf'(x) + \\frac{h^2}{2!}f''(x) - \\frac{h^3}{3!}f'''(x) + \\frac{h^4}{4!}f^{(4)}(x) - \\frac{h^5}{5!}f^{(5)}(x) + O(h^6)$$\nSubtracting the second expansion from the first yields:\n$$f(x+h) - f(x-h) = 2hf'(x) + 2\\frac{h^3}{3!}f'''(x) + 2\\frac{h^5}{5!}f^{(5)}(x) + O(h^7)$$\nSolving for $f'(x)$, we get:\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h} - \\frac{h^2}{6}f'''(x) - \\frac{h^4}{120}f^{(5)}(x) - O(h^6)$$\nThe second-order centered finite difference approximation for $f'(x)$, which we denote as $D_c(h)$, is:\n$$D_c(h) = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x-h)}{2h}$$\nThe truncation error, $T(h)$, is the difference between the approximation and the exact value, $T(h) = D_c(h) - f'(x)$. From the rearranged Taylor expansion, we have:\n$$T(h) = \\frac{h^2}{6}f'''(x) + \\frac{h^4}{120}f^{(5)}(x) + O(h^6)$$\nThe leading-order truncation error is $\\frac{h^2}{6}f'''(x)$. This shows that the approximation is second-order accurate, with the error proportional to $h^2$ and dependent on the third derivative of the function $f$ at $x$.\n\n#### Construction of the Extrapolated Approximation\nLet $A = f'(x)$ be the exact value and $A(h) = D_c(h)$ be our approximation using step size $h$. The error expansion is:\n$$A(h) = A + C_1 h^2 + C_2 h^4 + O(h^6)$$\nwhere $C_1 = \\frac{1}{6}f'''(x)$ and $C_2 = \\frac{1}{120}f^{(5)}(x)$.\nUsing a step size of $h/2$, the approximation is:\n$$A(h/2) = A + C_1 \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^4 + O(h^6) = A + \\frac{C_1}{4}h^2 + \\frac{C_2}{16}h^4 + O(h^6)$$\nTo eliminate the leading $h^2$ error term, we seek a linear combination of $A(h)$ and $A(h/2)$. We can write:\n$$4A(h/2) = 4A + C_1 h^2 + \\frac{C_2}{4}h^4 + O(h^6)$$\n$$A(h) = A + C_1 h^2 + C_2 h^4 + O(h^6)$$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives:\n$$4A(h/2) - A(h) = 3A - \\frac{3}{4}C_2 h^4 + O(h^6)$$\nSolving for $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{4A(h/2) - A(h)}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}C_2 h^4 + O(h^6)$$\nThe extrapolated approximation, $A_{extrap}$, is therefore:\n$$A_{extrap} = \\frac{4A(h/2) - A(h)}{3}$$\nThe error of this new approximation is $O(h^4)$, making it a fourth-order accurate method.\n\n#### Application to $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ at $x=1$\nThe exact derivative is $f'(x) = \\cos(x)$. At $x=1$, the exact value is $f'(1) = \\cos(1)$.\nUsing a high-precision calculator, $\\cos(1) \\approx 0.540302305868$.\nWe are given $h=0.2$ and $h/2=0.1$.\n\nFirst, we compute the second-order approximations.\nFor $h=0.2$:\n$$A(0.2) = \\frac{\\sin(1+0.2) - \\sin(1-0.2)}{2(0.2)} = \\frac{\\sin(1.2) - \\sin(0.8)}{0.4}$$\n$$A(0.2) \\approx \\frac{0.93203909 - 0.71735609}{0.4} \\approx \\frac{0.21468299}{0.4} \\approx 0.53670749$$\nFor $h=0.1$:\n$$A(0.1) = \\frac{\\sin(1+0.1) - \\sin(1-0.1)}{2(0.1)} = \\frac{\\sin(1.1) - \\sin(0.9)}{0.2}$$\n$$A(0.1) \\approx \\frac{0.89120736 - 0.78332691}{0.2} \\approx \\frac{0.10788045}{0.2} \\approx 0.53940225$$\n\nNext, we compute the extrapolated approximation:\n$$A_{extrap} = \\frac{4A(0.1) - A(0.2)}{3} \\approx \\frac{4(0.53940225) - 0.53670749}{3}$$\n$$A_{extrap} \\approx \\frac{2.15760900 - 0.53670749}{3} = \\frac{1.62090151}{3} \\approx 0.5403005033$$\nRounding to eight significant figures, we get $A_{extrap} = 0.54030050$.

The error is $E(h) = A(h) - f'(1)$.\n$$E(0.2) = A(0.2) - \\cos(1) \\approx 0.53670749 - 0.54030231 = -0.00359482$$\n$$E(0.1) = A(0.1) - \\cos(1) \\approx 0.53940225 - 0.54030231 = -0.00090006$$\nUsing more precise intermediate values:\n$E(0.2) \\approx 0.536707487668 - 0.540302305868 = -0.003594818200$\n$E(0.1) \\approx 0.539402252170 - 0.540302305868 = -0.000900053698$\nThe formula for the observed order is:\n$$p = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{|E(h)|}{|E(h/2)|}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{|E(0.2)|}{|E(0.1)|}\\right)$$\n$$p \\approx \\log_{2}\\!\\left(\\frac{|-0.003594818200|}{|-0.000900053698|}\\right) = \\log_{2}(3.9939374) = \\frac{\\ln(3.9939374)}{\\ln(2)}$$\n$$p \\approx \\frac{1.3847805}{0.6931472} \\approx 1.997818$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $p=1.998$. This value is very close to the theoretical order of $2$, verifying the analysis.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(A_{extrap}, p)$.\n$A_{extrap} \\approx 0.54030051$\n$p \\approx 1.998$",
