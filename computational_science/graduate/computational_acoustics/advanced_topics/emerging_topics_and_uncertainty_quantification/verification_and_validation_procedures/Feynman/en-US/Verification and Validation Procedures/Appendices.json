The validity of this linearization rests on the assumption that $\\delta$ is small, which is guaranteed by the problem statement ($|b_{m}|, |b_{n}|, \\sigma_{m}, \\sigma_{n} \\ll 1$). We perform a first-order Taylor series expansion of $\\ln(1+\\delta)$ around $\\delta = 0$:\n$$\n\\ln(1+\\delta) = \\delta - \\frac{\\delta^2}{2} + \\frac{\\delta^3}{3} - \\dots \\approx \\delta\n$$\nThis approximation is appropriate when terms of order $\\delta^2$ and higher are negligible compared to $\\delta$. Substituting this linear approximation into the expression for $\\Delta L$ gives the first-order approximation of the SPL error:\n$$\n\\Delta L \\approx \\frac{20}{\\ln(10)} \\delta = \\frac{20}{\\ln(10)} (b_{m} + b_{n} + \\varepsilon_{m} + \\varepsilon_{n})\n$$\nThis step demonstrates how the multiplicative pressure uncertainties propagate through the logarithmic SPL transformation, becoming additive errors in the SPL.\n\nWith this linearized expression, we can now derive the mean bias and the variance of the SPL error.\n\n**1. Mean Bias of the SPL Error, $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta L]$**\n\nThe mean bias is the expected value of the error, $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta L]$. Applying the expectation operator to our linearized expression:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta L] \\approx \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\frac{20}{\\ln(10)} (b_{m} + b_{n} + \\varepsilon_{m} + \\varepsilon_{n}) \\right]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, and since $b_m$ and $b_n$ are deterministic constants:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta L] \\approx \\frac{20}{\\ln(10)} (b_{m} + b_{n} + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_{m}] + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_{n}])\n$$\nThe problem states that the random errors $\\varepsilon_{m}$ and $\\varepsilon_{n}$ are zero-mean, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_{m}] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_{n}] = 0$. Therefore, the mean bias of the SPL error is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{L} - L_{\\star}] = \\frac{20}{\\ln(10)} (b_{m} + b_{n})\n$$\n\n**2. Variance of the SPL Error, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L)$**\n\nThe variance of the error is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{L} - L_{\\star})$. Using the linearized expression for $\\Delta L$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L) \\approx \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\frac{20}{\\ln(10)} (b_{m} + b_{n} + \\varepsilon_{m} + \\varepsilon_{n}) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the variance property $\\mathrm{Var}(aX+b) = a^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X)$, where the deterministic terms $(b_m+b_n)$ and the constant factor $\\frac{20}{\\ln(10)}$ are treated accordingly:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L) \\approx \\left(\\frac{20}{\\ln(10)}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(b_{m} + b_{n} + \\varepsilon_{m} + \\varepsilon_{n})\n$$\nSince $b_m$ and $b_n$ are constants, they do not contribute to the variance, so $\\mathrm{Var}(b_m+b_n+\\varepsilon_m+\\varepsilon_n) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_m+\\varepsilon_n)$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L) \\approx \\left(\\frac{20}{\\ln(10)}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{m} + \\varepsilon_{n})\n$$\nThe variance of a sum of two random variables is given by $\\mathrm{Var}(X+Y) = \\mathrm{Var}(X) + \\mathrm{Var}(Y) + 2\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)$.\nHere, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{m}) = \\sigma_{m}^2$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{n}) = \\sigma_{n}^2$. The covariance is related to the correlation coefficient $\\rho$ by $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\varepsilon_{m}, \\varepsilon_{n}) = \\rho \\sigma_{m} \\sigma_{n}$.\nSubstituting these into the variance expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_{m} + \\varepsilon_{n}) = \\sigma_{m}^2 + \\sigma_{n}^2 + 2\\rho\\sigma_{m}\\sigma_{n}\n$$\nThus, the variance of the SPL error is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{L} - L_{\\star}) = \\left(\\frac{20}{\\ln(10)}\\right)^2 (\\sigma_{m}^2 + \\sigma_{n}^2 + 2\\rho\\sigma_{m}\\sigma_{n})\n$$\n\n**3. Root-Mean-Square (RMS) SPL Error, $U_L$**\n\nFinally, we combine the mean bias and the variance to find the RMS error $U_L$, which is defined as the square root of the mean squared error (MSE). The MSE is the sum of the squared bias and the variance.\n$$\nU_{L} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{L} - L_{\\star}]\\right)^{2} + \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{L} - L_{\\star})}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expressions for the mean bias and variance:\n$$\nU_{L} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20}{\\ln(10)} (b_{m} + b_{n})\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\frac{20}{\\ln(10)}\\right)^2 (\\sigma_{m}^2 + \\sigma_{n}^2 + 2\\rho\\sigma_{m}\\sigma_{n})}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\left(\\frac{20}{\\ln(10)}\\right)^2$:\n$$\nU_{L} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{20}{\\ln(10)}\\right)^2 \\left[ (b_{m} + b_{n})^2 + \\sigma_{m}^2 + \\sigma_{n}^2 + 2\\rho\\sigma_{m}\\sigma_{n} \\right]}\n$$\nTaking the square root of the constant factor yields the final closed-form expression for the RMS SPL error, expressed in decibels (dB), as the SPL itself is.\n$$\nU_{L} = \\frac{20}{\\ln(10)} \\sqrt{(b_{m} + b_{n})^2 + \\sigma_{m}^2 + \\sigma_{n}^2 + 2\\rho\\sigma_{m}\\sigma_{n}}\n$$\nThis expression correctly combines the effects of deterministic biases and random errors from both measurement and numerical sources, including their correlation, to provide a single metric for the total uncertainty in the computed SPL.",
