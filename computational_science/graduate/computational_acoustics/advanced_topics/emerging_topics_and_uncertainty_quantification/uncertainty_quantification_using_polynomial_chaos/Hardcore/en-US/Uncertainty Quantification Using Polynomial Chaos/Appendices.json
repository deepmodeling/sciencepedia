            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional linear acoustic wave in a homogeneous medium where the sound speed is modeled as a random variable depending on two independent inputs, one Gaussian and one uniformly distributed. A Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is to be constructed for a scalar response quantity of interest in this computational acoustics setting. The PCE requires a set of orthonormal polynomial basis functions with respect to the probability measures of the random inputs. Specifically, let the two independent inputs be distributed as follows: $\\,\\xi_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\,$ and $\\,\\xi_2 \\sim \\mathcal{U}[-1,1]\\,$. \n\nStarting from the definition of orthonormality with respect to a probability measure and the independence of inputs, select appropriate univariate orthogonal polynomial families for $\\,\\xi_1\\,$ and $\\,\\xi_2\\,$ and determine their normalization to produce orthonormal bases. Then, use the tensor-product construction under the product measure for independent inputs to build a mixed Hermite–Legendre basis for the PCE of total polynomial degree less than or equal to $\\,2\\,$. \n\nProvide the final set of basis functions as explicit polynomials in $\\,\\xi_1\\,$ and $\\,\\xi_2\\,$ that are orthonormal under the joint probability density.

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of an orthonormal polynomial basis for a two-dimensional random input space, up to a total polynomial degree of $2$. The random vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\xi} = (\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$, where the components are independent random variables with specified probability distributions: $\\xi_1$ follows a standard normal distribution, $\\xi_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, and $\\xi_2$ follows a standard uniform distribution, $\\xi_2 \\sim \\mathcal{U}[-1,1]$.\n\nThe Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) represents a random quantity as a series expansion in terms of orthogonal polynomials of the underlying random inputs. The choice of polynomial family is dictated by the probability distribution of the random input to ensure orthogonality, a principle encapsulated by the Wiener-Askey scheme. Since the inputs $\\xi_1$ and $\\xi_2$ are independent, the joint probability density function (PDF) is the product of the individual PDFs: $f(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) = f_1(\\xi_1) f_2(\\xi_2)$. Consequently, the multivariate orthonormal basis can be constructed as a tensor product of the univariate orthonormal bases.\n\nLet $\\{\\Psi_k^{(i)}(\\xi_i)\\}$ be the set of orthonormal polynomials for the $i$-th random variable $\\xi_i$. Orthonormality is defined with respect to the probability measure of the variable, which means:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\Psi_j^{(i)}(\\xi_i) \\Psi_k^{(i)}(\\xi_i)] = \\int \\Psi_j^{(i)}(x) \\Psi_k^{(i)}(x) f_i(x) dx = \\delta_{jk}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{jk}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nFirst, we determine the appropriate orthonormal basis for each random variable.\n\nFor the first input, $\\xi_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, the PDF is $f_1(\\xi_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-\\xi_1^2/2)$. The corresponding family of orthogonal polynomials is the probabilists' Hermite polynomials, denoted $H_k(\\xi_1)$. Their orthogonality property with respect to the standard normal measure is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[H_j(\\xi_1) H_k(\\xi_1)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H_j(\\xi_1) H_k(\\xi_1) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\xi_1^2}{2}\\right) d\\xi_1 = k! \\delta_{jk}\n$$\nTo obtain an orthonormal basis $\\Psi_k^{(1)}(\\xi_1)$, we must normalize the Hermite polynomials by dividing by the square root of their squared norm, $\\sqrt{k!}$.\n$$\n\\Psi_k^{(1)}(\\xi_1) = \\frac{H_k(\\xi_1)}{\\sqrt{k!}}\n$$\nThe first three Hermite polynomials are:\n$H_0(\\xi_1) = 1$\n$H_1(\\xi_1) = \\xi_1$\n$H_2(\\xi_1) = \\xi_1^2 - 1$\nThus, the first three orthonormal univariate basis functions for $\\xi_1$ are:\n$\\Psi_0^{(1)}(\\xi_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0!}} H_0(\\xi_1) = 1$\n$\\Psi_1^{(1)}(\\xi_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1!}} H_1(\\xi_1) = \\xi_1$\n$\\Psi_2^{(1)}(\\xi_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2!}} H_2(\\xi_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\xi_1^2 - 1)$\n\nFor the second input, $\\xi_2 \\sim \\mathcal{U}[-1,1]$, the PDF is $f_2(\\xi_2) = 1/2$ for $\\xi_2 \\in [-1,1]$ and $0$ otherwise.
