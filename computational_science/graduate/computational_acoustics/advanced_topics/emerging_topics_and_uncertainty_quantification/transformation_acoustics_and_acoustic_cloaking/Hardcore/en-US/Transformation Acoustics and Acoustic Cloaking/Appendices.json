It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of transformation acoustics, is well-posed with a clear and consistent setup, and is expressed in objective, formal language. All necessary information for a unique solution is provided.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in analyzing a coordinate transformation from a virtual space (unprimed coordinates) to a physical space (primed coordinates). The Jacobian matrix of this transformation, when expressed in a local orthonormal basis, describes the anisotropic material properties required to achieve the acoustic cloaking effect.\n\nLet the virtual space be described by coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$ and the physical space by $\\mathbf{x}'$. The transformation is given by $\\mathbf{x}'(\\mathbf{x})$. The Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ required for the transformation acoustic parameter push-forward rules is the one that relates the infinitesimal displacement vectors expressed in their local orthonormal basis components. That is, if $d\\mathbf{s} = \\sum_i (ds)_i \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_i$ and $d\\mathbf{s}' = \\sum_j (ds')_j \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}'_j$, then the components are related by $(ds')_j = \\sum_i A_{ji} (ds)_i$. For a diagonal transformation like the one given, the basis vectors do not rotate ($\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}'_i = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_i$), and the matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ becomes a diagonal matrix of principal stretches, $\\lambda_i$. The principal stretch in a given direction is the ratio of an infinitesimal length in the physical space to the corresponding infinitesimal length in the virtual space.\n\nLet $\\alpha \\equiv \\frac{b-a}{b}$. The mapping is defined for a virtual radius $r \\in [0,b]$. This maps to the physical annulus $r' \\in [a, b]$.\n\n### Part 1: Two-Dimensional (2D) Case\n\nThe transformation is given by $r' = a + \\alpha r$ and $\\theta' = \\theta$.\nThe line element in the virtual space with polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ is $ds^2 = dr^2 + (r d\\theta)^2$.

In the high-frequency limit (geometric acoustics), rays minimize the travel-time functional $T = \\int ds/c$, where $ds$ is the Euclidean arclength element and $c$ is the local sound speed.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the difference in travel time, $\\Delta T = T_{\\text{cloak}} - T_{\\text{free}}$, for an acoustic ray traveling between a source $\\mathbf{x}_{S}$ and a receiver $\\mathbf{x}_{R}$ in the presence of a cylindrical acoustic cloak, compared to its travel time in a homogeneous free space.\n\nThe foundational principle of transformation acoustics is the form invariance of the governing wave equation under a coordinate transformation. The acoustic wave equation for a time-harmonic pressure field $p$ in a fluid with heterogeneous and anisotropic mass density $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}(\\mathbf{x})$ and heterogeneous bulk modulus $K(\\mathbf{x})$ is given as:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\big(\\boldsymbol{\\rho}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\nabla p\\big) + \\omega^{2} K^{-1}(\\mathbf{x})\\,p = 0\n$$\nIn a homogeneous, isotropic \"virtual\" space with constant parameters $\\rho_0$ and $K_0$, this equation simplifies to the Helmholtz equation:\n$$\n\\nabla_X^2 p + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c_0^2} p = 0\n$$\nwhere $c_0 = \\sqrt{K_0/\\rho_0}$ is the constant sound speed and $\\nabla_X^2$ is the Laplacian in the virtual coordinate system $\\mathbf{X}$.\n\nTransformation acoustics establishes a mapping $\\mathbf{x}(\\mathbf{X})$ from the virtual space to the physical space $\\mathbf{x}$ such that the Helmholtz equation in virtual space transforms into the general acoustic equation in physical space. This is achieved by defining the physical material parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}(\\mathbf{x})$ and $K(\\mathbf{x})$ based on the Jacobian of the transformation.\n\nA crucial consequence of this form invariance, particularly in the high-frequency (geometric acoustics) limit, is that the travel time of a ray is conserved under the transformation. The travel time functional, which rays extremize according to Fermat's principle, is equivalent in both spaces. If $dS = |\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{X}|$ is the arclength element in the virtual space and $ds = |\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}|$ is the arclength element in the physical space, this equivalence is expressed as:\n$$\nT = \\int_{\\text{physical ray}} \\frac{ds}{c(\\mathbf{x})} = \\int_{\\text{virtual ray}} \\frac{dS}{c_0}\n$$\nHere, $c(\\mathbf{x})$ is the effective (and generally anisotropic) speed of sound in the physical medium, and $c_0$ is the constant speed of sound in the virtual medium.\n\nWe can use this principle to calculate the travel time in the presence of the cloak, $T_{\\text{cloak}}$. We need to determine the corresponding path in the virtual space.\n\nThe given transformation maps the physical space $r \\in [a, b]$ to the virtual space $R \\in [0, b]$ via the function:\n$$\nR(r) = \\frac{b}{b - a}(r - a)\n$$\nThe region outside the cloak, $r \\geq b$, is mapped via the identity, so $R=r$. The cloaked core, $r  a$, is effectively removed from the propagation domain, as the entire physical annulus $a \\le r \\le b$ is compressed from the virtual disk $0 \\le R \\le b$. The inner boundary of the cloak, $r=a$, is mapped to the origin of the virtual space, $R=0$.\n\nIn the homogeneous virtual space, acoustic rays travel in straight lines. The source and receiver are located at $\\mathbf{x}_{S} = (-d, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{R} = (d, 0)$ respectively, with $d  b$. Since these points are in the region $rb$, their coordinates in the virtual space are identical: $\\mathbf{X}_{S} = (-d, 0)$ and $\\mathbf{X}_{R} = (d, 0)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that we are to consider the ray that is \"deflected around the inner radius $r=a$\". In the virtual space, this corresponds to a ray path that passes through the point $R=0$, which is the mapping of $r=a$. The straight line connecting $\\mathbf{X}_{S}$ and $\\mathbf{X}_{R}$ in the virtual space passes directly through the origin. This straight line is the ray path in the virtual space.\n\nThe travel time for this ray, $T_{\\text{cloak}}$, is therefore the travel time along the straight-line path in the virtual space. The length of this path, $L_{\\text{virtual}}$, is the Euclidean distance between $\\mathbf{X}_{S}$ and $\\mathbf{X}_{R}$:\n$$\nL_{\\text{virtual}} = |\\mathbf{X}_{R} - \\mathbf{X}_{S}| = \\sqrt{(d - (-d))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(2d)^2} = 2d\n$$\nThe travel time in the virtual space, and thus in the physical space for the cloaked ray, is:\n$$\nT_{\\text{cloak}} = \\frac{L_{\\text{virtual}}}{c_0} = \\frac{2d}{c_0}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the free-space travel time, $T_{\\text{free}}$. This is the time for a ray to travel between the same two points, $\\mathbf{x}_{S}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{R}$, in a homogeneous medium with sound speed $c_0$. In this case, the ray is a straight line in physical space. The problem provides the definition:\n$$\nT_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{x}_{R} - \\mathbf{x}_{S}|}{c_{0}}\n$$\nThe distance is the same as calculated before:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{x}_{R} - \\mathbf{x}_{S}| = 2d\n$$\nSo, the free-space travel time is:\n$$\nT_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{2d}{c_0}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta T$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = T_{\\text{cloak}} - T_{\\text{free}} = \\frac{2d}{c_0} - \\frac{2d}{c_0} = 0\n$$\nThe difference in travel time is exactly zero. The final answer is requested \"in seconds.\" Since the value is $0$, it is $0$ seconds.\n\nFor the concluding question: \"Conclude whether an ideal, lossless, non-dispersive transformation-acoustic cloak is detectable via time-of-flight measurements between exterior points solely on the basis of $\\Delta T$.\"\nSince $\\Delta T = 0$, the travel time of a ray deflected by the cloak is identical to the travel time of a ray in free space between the same endpoints. Therefore, based solely on this time-of-flight measurement, the presence of the ideal cloak is undetectable. The acoustic wave behaves as if it propagated through empty, homogeneous space, which is the defining characteristic of a perfect cloak.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe task is to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{K} \\mathbf{u} = \\lambda \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{u}$ for the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min}$. The matrices $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{M}$ are derived from a finite-volume discretization of the one-dimensional radial operator $\\mathcal{L}$. The solution involves three main steps for each test case: a) assembly of matrices $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{M}$, b) solution of the eigenproblem, and c) calculation of the scaled product $S$.\n\nFirst, for a given set of parameters $(a,b,\\varepsilon,N)$, we define the discrete domain. The size of the matrices is $D = N-2$, corresponding to the number of interior grid points. The grid spacing is $h = \\frac{b-a}{N-1}$. The interior grid points are located at $r_k = a + k h$ for $k=1, \\dots, D$. These points correspond to the matrix indices $i=0, \\dots, D-1$ (i.e., $i=k-1$).\n\nThe mass matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is a diagonal matrix of size $D \\times D$. Its diagonal entries are given by the coordinates of the interior grid points: $M_{ii} = r_{i+1} = a + (i+1)h$. Since $a=10$, all entries are positive, and $\\mathbf{M}$ is positive-definite.\n\nThe stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ is a symmetric tridiagonal matrix of size $D \\times D$. Its entries are built from the coefficient function $p(r') = \\frac{r'^{2}}{r' - a + \\varepsilon}$ evaluated at half-grid points. Let's define the terms $T_{k \\pm 1/2} = r_{k \\pm 1/2} p(r_{k \\pm 1/2})$, where $r_{k \\pm 1/2} = a+(k \\pm 1/2)h$. For the $i$-th row of the matrix (corresponding to grid point $r_{i+1}$), the entries are:\n-   Diagonal: $K_{ii} = \\frac{T_{i+1+1/2} + T_{i+1-1/2}}{h^{2}} = \\frac{T_{i+3/2} + T_{i+1/2}}{h^{2}}$\n-   Off-diagonal: $K_{i, i+1} = K_{i+1, i} = -\\frac{T_{i+1+1/2}}{h^{2}} = -\\frac{T_{i+3/2}}{h^{2}}$\n\nThese matrices are constructed computationally. For efficiency, we can first compute an array of the terms $T_{j+1/2}$ for $j=0, \\dots, D$. Then, the diagonals of $\\mathbf{K}$ can be assembled directly without an explicit loop.\n\nOnce $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{M}$ are assembled, we solve the generalized eigenvalue problem. Since $\\mathbf{K}$ is symmetric and $\\mathbf{M}$ is symmetric positive-definite, we can use a specialized eigensolver, such as `scipy.linalg.eigh`, which is numerically stable and efficient for this class of problems. It returns the eigenvalues in ascending order, so the smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\min}$, is the first element of the returned array of eigenvalues.\n\nFinally, we compute the scaled product $S = \\lambda_{\\min} \\times \\rho'_{r}(a)$. The density at the inner boundary is given by $\\rho'_{r}(a) = \\frac{a - a + \\varepsilon}{a} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{a}$. Thus, $S = \\lambda_{\\min} \\frac{\\varepsilon}{a}$.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for each of the five test cases provided. The final output is a list containing the pairs $[\\lambda_{\\min}, S]$ for each case.",
