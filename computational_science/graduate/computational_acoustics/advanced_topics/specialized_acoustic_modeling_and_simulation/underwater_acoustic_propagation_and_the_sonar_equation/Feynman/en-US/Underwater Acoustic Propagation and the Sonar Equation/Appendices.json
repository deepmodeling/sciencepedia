The given values for temperature and salinity are typical for deep ocean water. The tasks are mathematically well-defined and lead to a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\nThe objective is to determine the change in sound speed, $\\Delta c$, over a pressure change of $\\Delta P = 1000$ decibars, based on a linear approximation of the Mackenzie empirical formula.\n\nFirst, we construct the function for sound speed in terms of pressure, $c(T,S,P)$, by substituting depth $D$ in meters with pressure $P$ in decibars, as per the problem's instruction. The symbol $P$ will henceforth represent pressure in decibars.\nThe Mackenzie equation is:\n$$c(T,S,D) = 1448.96 + 4.591\\,T - 5.304\\times 10^{-2} T^{2} + 2.374\\times 10^{-4} T^{3} + 1.340\\,(S-35) + 1.630\\times 10^{-2} D + 1.675\\times 10^{-7} D^{2} - 1.025\\times 10^{-2} T\\,(S-35) - 7.139\\times 10^{-13} T\\,D^{3}$$\nSubstituting $D=P$, we get $c(T,S,P)$:\n$$c(T,S,P) = 1448.96 + 4.591\\,T - 5.304\\times 10^{-2} T^{2} + 2.374\\times 10^{-4} T^{3} + 1.340\\,(S-35) + 1.630\\times 10^{-2} P + 1.675\\times 10^{-7} P^{2} - 1.025\\times 10^{-2} T\\,(S-35) - 7.139\\times 10^{-13} T\\,P^{3}$$\nThe problem specifies constant temperature $T=4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and salinity $S=35\\,\\mathrm{g/kg}$. For $S=35\\,\\mathrm{g/kg}$, the terms containing $(S-35)$ become zero:\n$$1.340\\,(S-35) = 1.340\\,(35-35) = 0$$\n$$-1.025\\times 10^{-2} T\\,(S-35) = -1.025\\times 10^{-2} T\\,(35-35) = 0$$\nThe expression for $c(T,S,P)$ thus simplifies to a function of $T$ and $P$ only. For the purposes of differentiation with respect to $P$ at constant $T$, we can group all terms not containing $P$ into a single constant $C(T)$.\n$$c(T,S,P) = C(T) + 1.630\\times 10^{-2} P + 1.675\\times 10^{-7} P^{2} - 7.139\\times 10^{-13} T\\,P^{3}$$\nwhere $C(T) = 1448.96 + 4.591\\,T - 5.304\\times 10^{-2} T^{2} + 2.374\\times 10^{-4} T^{3}$.\n\nThe first task is to find the leading-order pressure sensitivity, which is the partial derivative of $c$ with respect to $P$, evaluated at $P=0$. We differentiate at fixed $T$ and $S$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial P} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P} \\left[ C(T) + 1.630\\times 10^{-2} P + 1.675\\times 10^{-7} P^{2} - 7.139\\times 10^{-13} T\\,P^{3} \\right]$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial P} = 0 + 1.630\\times 10^{-2} + 2 \\cdot (1.675\\times 10^{-7}) P - 3 \\cdot (7.139\\times 10^{-13}) T\\,P^{2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial P} = 1.630\\times 10^{-2} + 3.350\\times 10^{-7} P - 2.1417\\times 10^{-12} T\\,P^{2}$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at $P=0$ to find the sensitivity at zero gauge pressure (the sea surface):\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial P}\\right|_{P=0} = 1.630\\times 10^{-2} + 3.350\\times 10^{-7} (0) - 2.1417\\times 10^{-12} T\\,(0)^{2}$$\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial P}\\right|_{P=0} = 1.630\\times 10^{-2}$$\nThe units of this sensitivity are $\\mathrm{m/s}$ per decibar. This value is the leading-order coefficient for the pressure dependence of sound speed and is independent of temperature $T$ and salinity $S$.\n\nThe second task is to use a first-order Taylor expansion about $P=0$ to estimate the sound speed change, $\\Delta c$, for a pressure increase of $\\Delta P = 1000$ decibars. The first-order expansion of $c(P)$ around $P=0$ is:\n$$c(P) \\approx c(0) + \\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial P}\\right|_{P=0} \\cdot P$$\nThe change in sound speed, $\\Delta c = c(P) - c(0)$, is therefore approximated by:\n$$\\Delta c \\approx \\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial P}\\right|_{P=0} \\cdot P$$\nWe are interested in the change over $\\Delta P = 1000$ decibars, so we set $P = \\Delta P = 1000$.\n$$\\Delta c \\approx (1.630\\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{m/s/dbar}) \\cdot (1000 \\, \\mathrm{dbar})$$\n$$\\Delta c \\approx (0.01630) \\cdot 1000 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$$\n$$\\Delta c \\approx 16.30 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe problem asks for the numerical value to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $16.30$ rounded to three significant figures is $16.3$.\nThis result is the estimated increase in sound speed due to the effect of pressure alone over a depth change of approximately $1000$ meters.",

The slowness is the reciprocal of the speed, $|\\vec{S}| = 1/c$. The horizontal slowness, or ray parameter $p$, is given by:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\cos\\theta(z)}{c(z)} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nwhere $\\theta(z)$ is the local grazing angle of the ray with respect to the horizontal. This conserved quantity $p$ is the ray invariant.\n\nThe value of $p$ for any given ray is determined by its initial conditions at the source. For a source at depth $z_s$ launching a ray at angle $\\theta_s$, the invariant is:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_s}{c(z_s)}\n$$\nIn this problem, the source is located on the channel axis, so $z_s = z_0$. The sound speed at the source is therefore $c(z_s) = c(z_0) = c_0$. The ray invariant for any ray is:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_s}{c_0}\n$$\nA turning depth, $z_t$, is a depth at which a ray path becomes horizontal before reversing its vertical direction. At a turning point, the grazing angle is zero, i.e., $\\theta(z_t) = 0$. Consequently, $\\cos\\theta(z_t) = 1$.\n\nApplying the ray invariant condition at the turning depth gives:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\cos\\theta(z_t)}{c(z_t)} = \\frac{1}{c(z_t)}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $p$, we obtain the mathematical condition that defines the turning depths:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c(z_t)} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_s}{c_0} \\implies c(z_t) = \\frac{c_0}{\\cos\\theta_s}\n$$\nThis fundamental result states that a ray turns at the depth where the sound speed matches the initial horizontal phase speed of the ray, $c_0/\\cos\\theta_s$.\n\n**Part 2: Linearized Ray Dynamics and Caustics**\n\nThe differential equation for a ray path $z(r)$ in a stratified medium can be expressed in terms of the range $r$. The slope of the ray is $\\frac{dz}{dr} = \\tan\\theta(z)$. Using the ray invariant $p = \\cos\\theta(z)/c(z)$, we can write:\n$$\n\\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2\\theta}}{\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - p^2c^2(z)}}{pc(z)}\n$$\nThis leads to a non-linear ODE. For near-axial rays, we assume small grazing angles ($\\theta_s \\ll 1$) and small vertical excursions from the axis, $u(r) = z(r) - z_0$.\n\nUnder the small-angle (paraxial) approximation, $\\frac{dz}{dr} \\approx \\theta(z)$, and the ray equation can be shown to simplify to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2z}{dr^2} \\approx \\frac{1}{c_0} \\frac{dc}{dz}\n$$\nLet's linearize the sound-speed profile for small $u = z-z_0$: The profile is $c(z) = c_0[1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}(z-z_0)^2]$.\nThe gradient of the sound speed is:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dz} = c_0 \\Gamma (z-z_0) = c_0 \\Gamma u\n$$\nSubstituting this into the paraxial ray equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} = \\frac{d^2z}{dr^2} \\approx \\frac{1}{c_0} (c_0 \\Gamma u) = \\Gamma u\n$$\nThis seems to have a sign error. Let's re-derive with care. A more accurate form is $\\frac{d^2z}{dr^2} = n \\frac{dn}{dz} / p^2$, where $n(z)=c_0/c(z)$ is the index of refraction. For near-axial rays, $p \\approx n(z_0) = 1$ and $n(z) \\approx 1$.\n$n(z) = \\frac{c_0}{c_0(1+\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}u^2)} \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}u^2$.\n$\\frac{dn}{dz} = \\frac{dn}{du} = -\\Gamma u$.\nThe paraxial ray equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \\Gamma u = 0\n$$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator in range $r$, with angular frequency $\\sqrt{\\Gamma}$. The vertical displacement $u(r)$ oscillates sinusoidally as the ray propagates horizontally.\n\nThe general solution is $u(r) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r)$.\nThe initial conditions at the source $(r=0)$ are:\n$1$. $u(0) = z(0) - z_0 = z_s - z_0 = 0$. This implies $A=0$.\n$2$. $\\frac{du}{dr}|_{r=0} = \\tan\\theta_s$. For small angles, $\\tan\\theta_s \\approx \\theta_s$.\nThe derivative of the solution is $\\frac{du}{dr} = B\\sqrt{\\Gamma}\\cos(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r)$. At $r=0$, this gives $B\\sqrt{\\Gamma} = \\tan\\theta_s$.\nThus, $B = \\frac{\\tan\\theta_s}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}}$.\nThe ray trajectory for small angles is:\n$$\nu(r; \\theta_s) = \\frac{\\tan\\theta_s}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r)\n$$\nCaustics are envelopes of the ray family, where infinitesimally close rays cross. For a family of rays parameterized by launch angle $\\theta_s$, a caustic occurs at a range $r$ where a small change in $\\theta_s$ produces no change in depth $z$, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\theta_s} = 0$ or $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\theta_s} = 0$. Using the small-angle approximation $\\tan\\theta_s \\approx \\theta_s$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\theta_s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_s} \\left( \\frac{\\theta_s}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r)\n$$\nSetting this to zero for $r > 0$ yields the condition for caustics:\n$$\n\\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r) = 0\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied when $\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r = n\\pi$ for integer $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe ranges of the caustics are therefore:\n$$\nr_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}}\n$$\nAt these ranges, the vertical displacement is $u(r_n) = \\frac{\\tan\\theta_s}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}}\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$. This means all near-axial rays, regardless of their launch angle, re-converge on the channel axis $z=z_0$ at these specific ranges. These are therefore known as axial caustics or convergence zones.\n\n**Part 3: Turning Depths for $\\theta_s = 1^{\\circ}$**\n\nUsing the turning depth condition $c(z_t) = c_0 / \\cos\\theta_s$ and the given profile for $c(z)$:\n$$\nc_{0}\\left[1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\left(z_t - z_{0}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\frac{c_0}{\\cos\\theta_s}\n$$\n$$\n1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}(z_t - z_0)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta_s}\n$$\n$$\n(z_t - z_0)^2 = \\frac{2}{\\Gamma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta_s} - 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nz_{t,\\pm} = z_0 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\Gamma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta_s} - 1 \\right)}\n$$\nWe are given $\\theta_s = 1^{\\circ}$, $z_0 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\Gamma = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-2}}$.

For a family of rays launched with a spectrum of angles up to some $|\\theta_{s, \\text{max}}|$, there will be a corresponding maximum turning depth excursion, $|z_t - z_0|_{\\text{max}}$. The envelope of these turning depths confines the acoustic energy within the sound channel. The regions in depth above the uppermost turning depth and below the lowermost turning depth are shadow zones, into which no direct ray path from the source can penetrate.\n\n**Part 4: Range of the First Axial Caustic**\n\nFrom the analysis in Part 2, the ranges of the axial caustics are given by $r_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}}$.

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Formulation\n\nThe problem requires a comparative analysis of two signal processing strategies. We begin by converting the given decibel quantities into linear units, which forms the basis for physical calculations. Let the reference pressure be $p_{\\text{ref}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu Pa}$ and the reference spectral density be $S_{\\text{ref}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu Pa}^2/\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe mean-square signal pressure, $p_s^2$, is derived from the received level $RL$:\n$$RL = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{p_s^2}{p_{\\text{ref}}^2}\\right) \\implies p_s^2 = p_{\\text{ref}}^2 \\times 10^{RL/10}$$\nGiven $RL = 100\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, we have $p_s^2 = p_{\\text{ref}}^2 \\times 10^{100/10} = 10^{10} p_{\\text{ref}}^2$.\n\nThe noise power spectral density (PSD), $S_{pp}(f)$, is constant over the band of interest. Let's denote this constant value as $N_0$. It is derived from the spectrum level $NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}$:\n$$NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{S_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\implies N_0 = S_{\\text{ref}} \\times 10^{NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}/10}$$\nGiven $NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, we have $N_0 = S_{\\text{ref}} \\times 10^{60/10} = 10^{6} S_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nThe directivity index, $DI$, relates to the linear directivity factor, $D$, which quantifies the reduction in isotropic noise power:\n$$DI = 10 \\log_{10}(D) \\implies D = 10^{DI/10}$$\nGiven $DI = 12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, we have $D = 10^{12/10} = 10^{1.2}$.\n\nThe output noise mean-square pressure from the beamformer, $p_{n, \\text{out}}^2$, is the input noise pressure, $p_{n, \\text{in}}^2$, divided by the directivity factor $D$. The input noise pressure is the integral of the noise PSD $N_0$ over the processing bandwidth $W$, which simplifies to $N_0 W$ since $N_0$ is constant.\n$$p_{n, \\text{out}}^2 = \\frac{p_{n, \\text{in}}^2}{D} = \\frac{N_0 W}{D}$$\nThe signal is on-axis, so the beamformer preserves its power: $p_{s, \\text{out}}^2 = p_s^2$. The output signal-to-noise ratio in decibels is $SNR = RL - NL$, where $NL$ is the output noise level.\n\nWe now analyze each strategy.\n\n**1. Broadband (BB) Energy Detection Strategy**\nThe processing bandwidth is $W_{\\text{BB}} = B = 200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n- **Task 1: Integrated noise mean-square pressure at the beamformer output.**\n$$p_{n, \\text{out, BB}}^2 = \\frac{N_0 B}{D} = \\frac{(10^6 S_{\\text{ref}}) \\times (200\\,\\mathrm{Hz})}{10^{1.2}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^8}{10^{1.2}} p_{\\text{ref}}^2$$\n\n- **Task 2: Noise level $NL_{\\text{BB}}$ in decibels.**\nThe output noise level $NL_{\\text{BB}}$ is calculated as:\n$$NL_{\\text{BB}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{p_{n, \\text{out, BB}}^2}{p_{\\text{ref}}^2}\\right) = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0 B}{D p_{\\text{ref}}^2}\\right)$$\nThis can be expressed using the decibel values directly:\n$$NL_{\\text{BB}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{S_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) + 10 \\log_{10}(B) - 10 \\log_{10}(D)$$\n$$NL_{\\text{BB}} = NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} + 10 \\log_{10}(B) - DI$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$NL_{\\text{BB}} = 60 + 10 \\log_{10}(200) - 12 = 48 + 10(\\log_{10}(2) + 2) \\approx 48 + 23.0103 = 71.0103\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\n- **Task 3: Output signal-to-noise ratio $SNR_{\\text{BB}}$.**\n$$SNR_{\\text{BB}} = RL - NL_{\\text{BB}} \\approx 100 - 71.0103 = 28.9897\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\n**2. Narrowband (NB) Coherent Line Processing Strategy**\nThe effective resolution bandwidth is $W_{\\text{NB}} = \\Delta f = 1/T = 1/300\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n- **Task 1: Integrated noise mean-square pressure at the beamformer output.**\n$$p_{n, \\text{out, NB}}^2 = \\frac{N_0 \\Delta f}{D} = \\frac{(10^6 S_{\\text{ref}}) \\times (1/300\\,\\mathrm{Hz})}{10^{1.2}} = \\frac{10^6 / 300}{10^{1.2}} p_{\\text{ref}}^2 = \\frac{10^4 / 3}{10^{1.2}} p_{\\text{ref}}^2$$\n\n- **Task 2: Noise level $NL_{\\text{NB}}$ in decibels.**\n$$NL_{\\text{NB}} = NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} + 10 \\log_{10}(\\Delta f) - DI$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$NL_{\\text{NB}} = 60 + 10 \\log_{10}(1/300) - 12 = 48 - 10 \\log_{10}(300) = 48 - 10(\\log_{10}(3) + 2) \\approx 48 - 24.7712 = 23.2288\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\n- **Task 3: Output signal-to-noise ratio $SNR_{\\text{NB}}$.**\nThe monochromatic signal power is fully captured in the single Fourier bin.\n$$SNR_{\\text{NB}} = RL - NL_{\\text{NB}} \\approx 100 - 23.2288 = 76.7712\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\n**3. SNR Advantage**\nThe SNR advantage of the narrowband strategy over the broadband strategy is the difference in their respective SNRs.\n\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = SNR_{\\text{NB}} - SNR_{\\text{BB}}$$\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = (RL - NL_{\\text{NB}}) - (RL - NL_{\\text{BB}}) = NL_{\\text{BB}} - NL_{\\text{NB}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the noise levels:\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = (NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} + 10 \\log_{10}(B) - DI) - (NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} + 10 \\log_{10}(\\Delta f) - DI)$$\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = 10 \\log_{10}(B) - 10 \\log_{10}(\\Delta f) = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{B}{\\Delta f}\\right)$$\nThis result, known as the processing gain, is independent of the signal level, noise spectral level, and directivity index, as these factors affect both SNRs equally. Substituting the values for the bandwidths:\n$$B = 200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$\\Delta f = \\frac{1}{300}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{200}{1/300}\\right) = 10 \\log_{10}(200 \\times 300) = 10 \\log_{10}(60000)$$\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = 10 \\log_{10}(6 \\times 10^4) = 10(\\log_{10}(6) + \\log_{10}(10^4)) = 10(\\log_{10}(6) + 4)$$\nUsing $\\log_{10}(6) \\approx 0.77815$:\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} \\approx 10(0.77815 + 4) = 47.7815\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the SNR advantage is $47.78\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.",
