The slowness is the reciprocal of the speed, $|\\vec{S}| = 1/c$. The horizontal slowness, or ray parameter $p$, is given by:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\cos\\theta(z)}{c(z)} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nwhere $\\theta(z)$ is the local grazing angle of the ray with respect to the horizontal. This conserved quantity $p$ is the ray invariant.\n\nThe value of $p$ for any given ray is determined by its initial conditions at the source. For a source at depth $z_s$ launching a ray at angle $\\theta_s$, the invariant is:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_s}{c(z_s)}\n$$\nIn this problem, the source is located on the channel axis, so $z_s = z_0$. The sound speed at the source is therefore $c(z_s) = c(z_0) = c_0$. The ray invariant for any ray is:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_s}{c_0}\n$$\nA turning depth, $z_t$, is a depth at which a ray path becomes horizontal before reversing its vertical direction. At a turning point, the grazing angle is zero, i.e., $\\theta(z_t) = 0$. Consequently, $\\cos\\theta(z_t) = 1$.\n\nApplying the ray invariant condition at the turning depth gives:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\cos\\theta(z_t)}{c(z_t)} = \\frac{1}{c(z_t)}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $p$, we obtain the mathematical condition that defines the turning depths:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{c(z_t)} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta_s}{c_0} \\implies c(z_t) = \\frac{c_0}{\\cos\\theta_s}\n$$\nThis fundamental result states that a ray turns at the depth where the sound speed matches the initial horizontal phase speed of the ray, $c_0/\\cos\\theta_s$.\n\n**Part 2: Linearized Ray Dynamics and Caustics**\n\nThe differential equation for a ray path $z(r)$ in a stratified medium can be expressed in terms of the range $r$. The slope of the ray is $\\frac{dz}{dr} = \\tan\\theta(z)$. Using the ray invariant $p = \\cos\\theta(z)/c(z)$, we can write:\n$$\n\\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-\\cos^2\\theta}}{\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - p^2c^2(z)}}{pc(z)}\n$$\nThis leads to a non-linear ODE. For near-axial rays, we assume small grazing angles ($\\theta_s \\ll 1$) and small vertical excursions from the axis, $u(r) = z(r) - z_0$.\n\nUnder the small-angle (paraxial) approximation, $\\frac{dz}{dr} \\approx \\theta(z)$, and the ray equation can be shown to simplify to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2z}{dr^2} \\approx \\frac{1}{c_0} \\frac{dc}{dz}\n$$\nLet's linearize the sound-speed profile for small $u = z-z_0$: The profile is $c(z) = c_0[1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}(z-z_0)^2]$.\nThe gradient of the sound speed is:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dz} = c_0 \\Gamma (z-z_0) = c_0 \\Gamma u\n$$\nSubstituting this into the paraxial ray equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} = \\frac{d^2z}{dr^2} \\approx \\frac{1}{c_0} (c_0 \\Gamma u) = \\Gamma u\n$$\nThis seems to have a sign error. Let's re-derive with care. A more accurate form is $\\frac{d^2z}{dr^2} = n \\frac{dn}{dz} / p^2$, where $n(z)=c_0/c(z)$ is the index of refraction. For near-axial rays, $p \\approx n(z_0) = 1$ and $n(z) \\approx 1$.\n$n(z) = \\frac{c_0}{c_0(1+\\frac{\\Gamma}{2}u^2)} \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}u^2$.\n$\\frac{dn}{dz} = \\frac{dn}{du} = -\\Gamma u$.\nThe paraxial ray equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u}{dr^2} + \\Gamma u = 0\n$$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator in range $r$, with angular frequency $\\sqrt{\\Gamma}$. The vertical displacement $u(r)$ oscillates sinusoidally as the ray propagates horizontally.\n\nThe general solution is $u(r) = A \\cos(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r) + B \\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r)$.\nThe initial conditions at the source $(r=0)$ are:\n$1$. $u(0) = z(0) - z_0 = z_s - z_0 = 0$. This implies $A=0$.\n$2$. $\\frac{du}{dr}|_{r=0} = \\tan\\theta_s$. For small angles, $\\tan\\theta_s \\approx \\theta_s$.\nThe derivative of the solution is $\\frac{du}{dr} = B\\sqrt{\\Gamma}\\cos(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r)$. At $r=0$, this gives $B\\sqrt{\\Gamma} = \\tan\\theta_s$.\nThus, $B = \\frac{\\tan\\theta_s}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}}$.\nThe ray trajectory for small angles is:\n$$\nu(r; \\theta_s) = \\frac{\\tan\\theta_s}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r)\n$$\nCaustics are envelopes of the ray family, where infinitesimally close rays cross. For a family of rays parameterized by launch angle $\\theta_s$, a caustic occurs at a range $r$ where a small change in $\\theta_s$ produces no change in depth $z$, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\theta_s} = 0$ or $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\theta_s} = 0$. Using the small-angle approximation $\\tan\\theta_s \\approx \\theta_s$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\theta_s} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_s} \\left( \\frac{\\theta_s}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r) \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}} \\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r)\n$$\nSetting this to zero for $r > 0$ yields the condition for caustics:\n$$\n\\sin(\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r) = 0\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied when $\\sqrt{\\Gamma}r = n\\pi$ for integer $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\nThe ranges of the caustics are therefore:\n$$\nr_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}}\n$$\nAt these ranges, the vertical displacement is $u(r_n) = \\frac{\\tan\\theta_s}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}}\\sin(n\\pi) = 0$. This means all near-axial rays, regardless of their launch angle, re-converge on the channel axis $z=z_0$ at these specific ranges. These are therefore known as axial caustics or convergence zones.\n\n**Part 3: Turning Depths for $\\theta_s = 1^{\\circ}$**\n\nUsing the turning depth condition $c(z_t) = c_0 / \\cos\\theta_s$ and the given profile for $c(z)$:\n$$\nc_{0}\\left[1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}\\left(z_t - z_{0}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\frac{c_0}{\\cos\\theta_s}\n$$\n$$\n1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{2}(z_t - z_0)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta_s}\n$$\n$$\n(z_t - z_0)^2 = \\frac{2}{\\Gamma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta_s} - 1 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nz_{t,\\pm} = z_0 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\Gamma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta_s} - 1 \\right)}\n$$\nWe are given $\\theta_s = 1^{\\circ}$, $z_0 = 1000$ m, and $\\Gamma = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ m$^{-2}$. First, convert the angle to radians: $\\theta_s = 1^{\\circ} = \\frac{\\pi}{180}$ rad.\nThe term in the square root is:\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\cos(\\pi/180)} - 1 \\right)}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\sqrt{5.0 \\times 10^8 \\times (1.00015233 - 1)} = \\sqrt{5.0 \\times 10^8 \\times 1.523315 \\times 10^{-4}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\sqrt{76165.75} \\approx 275.981 \\text{ m}\n$$\nThe pair of turning depths is:\n$z_{t,+} = z_0 + \\Delta z = 1000 + 275.981 = 1275.981$ m\n$z_{t,-} = z_0 - \\Delta z = 1000 - 275.981 = 724.019$ m\n\nInterpretation: The turning depths define the maximum vertical extent of a ray. For a family of rays launched a with a spectrum of angles up to some $|\\theta_{s, \\text{max}}|$, there will be a corresponding maximum turning depth excursion, $|z_t - z_0|_{\\text{max}}$. The envelope of these turning depths confines the acoustic energy within the sound channel. The regions in depth above the uppermost turning depth and below the lowermost turning depth are shadow zones, into which no direct ray path from the source can penetrate.\n\n**Part 4: Range of the First Axial Caustic**\n\nFrom the analysis in Part 2, the ranges of the axial caustics are given by $r_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}}$. The first axial caustic corresponds to $n=1$:\n$$\nr_c = r_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\Gamma}}\n$$\nUsing the given value $\\Gamma = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ m$^{-2}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\Gamma} = \\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}} \\text{ m}^{-1} \\approx 6.324555 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe range of the first caustic is:\n$$\nr_c = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{4.0 \\times 10^{-9}}} \\text{ m} \\approx \\frac{3.14159265}{6.324555 \\times 10^{-5}} \\text{ m} \\approx 49673.43 \\text{ m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilometers (km), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nr_c = 49.67343 \\text{ km}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $r_c = 49.67$ km.",

            "problem": "A coherent continuous-wave underwater source emits at frequency $f$ in a horizontally stratified, lossless ocean with constant sound speed $c$ and a pressure-release free surface at $z=0$.

Depth is measured positive downward. You may neglect bottom interactions and assume deep water such that only the free-surface reflection is relevant.\n\nFrom first principles of computational acoustics, proceed as follows:\n- Begin with the time-harmonic acoustic wave equation and the fundamental point-source solution in a homogeneous medium.\n- Impose the free-surface pressure-release boundary condition using the method of images to construct the direct path and the surface-reflected path.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in underwater acoustics that is solvable using established physical principles and mathematical methods. All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions are physically reasonable for an idealized scenario.\n\nThe analysis begins with the time-harmonic acoustic wave equation, also known as the Helmholtz equation, which governs the spatial variation of the complex acoustic pressure $p$ for a single frequency source in a homogeneous medium. Away from any sources, the equation is $(\\nabla^2 + k^2)p = 0$, where $k$ is the acoustic wavenumber. For a point source, the fundamental solution in an unbounded medium is a spherical wave. The complex pressure $p_d$ at a distance $R_d$ from the source is given by:\n$$p_d = A \\frac{\\exp(ikR_d)}{R_d}$$\nwhere $A$ is a constant representing the source strength and time-harmonic dependence $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$ is implicitly assumed. The wavenumber is $k = \\omega/c = 2\\pi f/c$, where $f$ is the frequency and $c$ is the sound speed.\n\nThe problem specifies a source at depth $z_s > 0$ and a receiver at horizontal range $r$ and depth $z_r > 0$. The coordinate system defines the free surface at $z=0$, with depth increasing downwards. The distance for the direct path from the source to the receiver is:\n$$R_d = \\sqrt{r^2 + (z_r - z_s)^2}$$\n\nThe free surface at $z=0$ is a pressure-release boundary, meaning the total pressure at the surface must be zero for all time and positions on the surface: $p(r, z=0) = 0$. To satisfy this boundary condition, the method of images is employed. An image source is placed at the mirror-image position above the surface, at depth $-z_s$. To achieve perfect cancellation of pressure at $z=0$, this image source must have an opposite phase, which corresponds to a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians or a negative amplitude. The pressure contribution from this image source, $p_r$, represents the surface-reflected path. The distance from the image source to the receiver is:\n$$R_r = \\sqrt{r^2 + (z_r - (-z_s))^2} = \\sqrt{r^2 + (z_r + z_s)^2}$$\n\nThe total complex pressure at the receiver is the coherent superposition of the pressure from the direct path and the surface-reflected path:\n$$p(r, z_r) = p_d + p_r = A \\left( \\frac{\\exp(ikR_d)}{R_d} - \\frac{\\exp(ikR_r)}{R_r} \\right)$$\nThe minus sign before the second term accounts for the $\\pi$ phase shift upon reflection.\n\nThe Lloyd mirror effect is the interference phenomenon resulting from this superposition. The total acoustic intensity, proportional to $|p|^2$, exhibits a spatial interference pattern. This pattern arises from the phase difference between the two paths, which has two components: a geometric phase difference $k(R_r - R_d)$ due to the path length difference, and the fixed $\\pi$ phase reversal from the reflection itself. The total phase difference is $\\Delta\\Phi = k(R_r - R_d) - \\pi$. The modulation of the received acoustic intensity translates directly to a modulation of the Received Level ($RL$) in decibels. In the context of the sonar equation, this interference pattern is captured within the transmission loss ($TL$) term, which therefore varies significantly with geometry ($r, z_s, z_r$).\n\nIn the far-field regime where $r \\gg z_s, z_r$, the path length difference can be approximated. Using the binomial expansion $(1+x)^{1/2} \\approx 1 + x/2$ for small $x$:\n$$R_d = r \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{(z_r - z_s)^2}{r^2}} \\approx r \\left( 1 + \\frac{(z_r - z_s)^2}{2r^2} \\right)$$\n$$R_r = r \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{(z_r + z_s)^2}{r^2}} \\approx r \\left( 1 + \\frac{(z_r + z_s)^2}{2r^2} \\right)$$\nThe path length difference $\\Delta R = R_r - R_d$ is then:\n$$\\Delta R \\approx \\left( r + \\frac{(z_r + z_s)^2}{2r} \\right) - \\left( r + \\frac{(z_r - z_s)^2}{2r} \\right) = \\frac{(z_r^2 + 2z_s z_r + z_s^2) - (z_r^2 - 2z_s z_r + z_s^2)}{2r}$$\n$$\\Delta R \\approx \\frac{4z_s z_r}{2r} = \\frac{2z_s z_r}{r}$$\nThis is the leading-order approximation for the path length difference. The corresponding geometric phase difference is $k\\Delta R \\approx \\frac{2kz_s z_r}{r}$.\n\nTo find the spacing between interference fringes, we analyze the acoustic intensity $I \\propto |p|^2$. In the far-field, the amplitudes from the two paths are nearly equal, $1/R_d \\approx 1/R_r \\approx 1/r$. The intensity becomes:\n$$I \\propto \\left| \\frac{A}{r} \\left( \\exp(ikR_d) - \\exp(ikR_r) \\right) \\right|^2 = \\frac{|A|^2}{r^2} \\left| 1 - \\exp(ik\\Delta R) \\right|^2$$\n$$I \\propto \\frac{|A|^2}{r^2} (2 - 2\\cos(k\\Delta R)) = \\frac{4|A|^2}{r^2} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k\\Delta R}{2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the far-field approximation for $\\Delta R$:\n$$I(z_r) \\propto \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k}{2} \\frac{2z_s z_r}{r}\\right) = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{kz_s z_r}{r}\\right)$$\nThe interference fringes in $RL$ correspond to the extrema of $I(z_r)$. Adjacent maxima (or adjacent minima) occur when the argument of the $\\sin^2$ function changes by $\\pi$. Let $z_{r,n}$ and $z_{r,n+1}$ be the receiver depths of two adjacent fringes. Then:\n$$\\frac{kz_s z_{r,n+1}}{r} - \\frac{kz_s z_{r,n}}{r} = \\pi$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{kz_s}{r} (z_{r,n+1} - z_{r,n}) = \\pi$$\nThe spacing in receiver depth between adjacent fringes, $\\Delta z_r = z_{r,n+1} - z_{r,n}$, is therefore:\n$$\\Delta z_r = \\frac{\\pi r}{kz_s}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression. Note that since $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$, where $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, this expression is equivalent to the classic Lloyd's mirror formula $\\Delta z_r = \\frac{\\lambda r}{2z_s}$.\n\nFor the numerical calculation, the given parameters are:\n$f=2000$ Hz\n$c=1500$ m/s\n$z_s=50$ m\n$r=3000$ m\n\nFirst, the acoustic wavenumber $k$ is calculated:\n$$k = \\frac{2\\pi f}{c} = \\frac{2\\pi(2000)}{1500} = \\frac{4000\\pi}{1500} = \\frac{8\\pi}{3} \\text{ rad/m}$$\nNow, substitute the values into the derived expression for the fringe spacing $\\Delta z_r$:\n$$\\Delta z_r = \\frac{\\pi r}{kz_s} = \\frac{\\pi(3000)}{(\\frac{8\\pi}{3})(50)} = \\frac{3000 \\cdot 3}{8 \\cdot 50} = \\frac{9000}{400} = \\frac{90}{4} = 22.5 \\text{ m}$$\nThe required precision is three significant figures. The calculated value of $22.5$ m already has three significant figures.\nThus, the numerical value of the adjacent-fringe spacing is $22.5$ m.",

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Formulation\n\nThe problem requires a comparative analysis of two signal processing strategies. We begin by converting the given decibel quantities into linear units, which forms the basis for physical calculations. Let the reference pressure be $p_{\\text{ref}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu Pa}$ and the reference spectral density be $S_{\\text{ref}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu Pa}^2/\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe mean-square signal pressure, $p_s^2$, is derived from the received level $RL$:\n$$RL = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{p_s^2}{p_{\\text{ref}}^2}\\right) \\implies p_s^2 = p_{\\text{ref}}^2 \\times 10^{RL/10}$$\nGiven $RL = 100\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, we have $p_s^2 = p_{\\text{ref}}^2 \\times 10^{100/10} = 10^{10}\\,p_{\\text{ref}}^2$.\n\nThe noise power spectral density (PSD), $S_{pp}(f)$, is constant over the band of interest. Let's denote this constant value as $N_0$. It is derived from the spectrum level $NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}$:\n$$NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{S_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\implies N_0 = S_{\\text{ref}} \\times 10^{NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}/10}$$\nGiven $NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, we have $N_0 = S_{\\text{ref}} \\times 10^{60/10} = 10^{6}\\,S_{\\text{ref}}$.\n\nThe directivity index, $DI$, relates to the linear directivity factor, $D$, which quantifies the reduction in isotropic noise power:\n$$DI = 10 \\log_{10}(D) \\implies D = 10^{DI/10}$$\nGiven $DI = 12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, we have $D = 10^{12/10} = 10^{1.2}$.\n\nThe output noise mean-square pressure from the beamformer, $p_{n, \\text{out}}^2$, is the input noise pressure, $p_{n, \\text{in}}^2$, divided by the directivity factor $D$. The input noise pressure is the integral of the noise PSD $N_0$ over the processing bandwidth $W$, which simplifies to $N_0 W$ since $N_0$ is constant.\n$$p_{n, \\text{out}}^2 = \\frac{p_{n, \\text{in}}^2}{D} = \\frac{N_0 W}{D}$$\nThe signal is on-axis, so the beamformer preserves its power: $p_{s, \\text{out}}^2 = p_s^2$. The output signal-to-noise ratio in decibels is $SNR = RL - NL$, where $NL$ is the output noise level.\n\nWe now analyze each strategy.\n\n**1. Broadband (BB) Energy Detection Strategy**\nThe processing bandwidth is $W_{\\text{BB}} = B = 200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n- **Task 1: Integrated noise mean-square pressure at the beamformer output.**\n$$p_{n, \\text{out, BB}}^2 = \\frac{N_0 B}{D} = \\frac{(10^6\\,S_{\\text{ref}}) \\times (200\\,\\mathrm{Hz})}{10^{1.2}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^8}{10^{1.2}}\\,p_{\\text{ref}}^2$$\n\n- **Task 2: Noise level $NL_{\\text{BB}}$ in decibels.**\nThe output noise level $NL_{\\text{BB}}$ is calculated as:\n$$NL_{\\text{BB}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{p_{n, \\text{out, BB}}^2}{p_{\\text{ref}}^2}\\right) = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0 B}{D p_{\\text{ref}}^2}\\right)$$\nThis can be expressed using the decibel values directly:\n$$NL_{\\text{BB}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{S_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) + 10 \\log_{10}(B) - 10 \\log_{10}(D)$$\n$$NL_{\\text{BB}} = NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} + 10 \\log_{10}(B) - DI$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$NL_{\\text{BB}} = 60 + 10 \\log_{10}(200) - 12 = 48 + 10( \\log_{10}(2) + 2) \\approx 48 + 23.0103 = 71.0103\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\n- **Task 3: Output signal-to-noise ratio $SNR_{\\text{BB}}$.**\n$$SNR_{\\text{BB}} = RL - NL_{\\text{BB}} \\approx 100 - 71.0103 = 28.9897\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\n**2. Narrowband (NB) Coherent Line Processing Strategy**\nThe effective resolution bandwidth is $W_{\\text{NB}} = \\Delta f = 1/T = 1/300\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n- **Task 1: Integrated noise mean-square pressure at the beamformer output.**\n$$p_{n, \\text{out, NB}}^2 = \\frac{N_0 \\Delta f}{D} = \\frac{(10^6\\,S_{\\text{ref}}) \\times (1/300\\,\\mathrm{Hz})}{10^{1.2}} = \\frac{10^6 / 300}{10^{1.2}}\\,p_{\\text{ref}}^2 = \\frac{10^4 / 3}{10^{1.2}}\\,p_{\\text{ref}}^2$$\n\n- **Task 2: Noise level $NL_{\\text{NB}}$ in decibels.**\n$$NL_{\\text{NB}} = NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} + 10 \\log_{10}(\\Delta f) - DI$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$NL_{\\text{NB}} = 60 + 10 \\log_{10}(1/300) - 12 = 48 - 10 \\log_{10}(300) = 48 - 10(\\log_{10}(3) + 2) \\approx 48 - 24.7712 = 23.2288\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\n- **Task 3: Output signal-to-noise ratio $SNR_{\\text{NB}}$.**\nThe monochromatic signal power is fully captured in the single Fourier bin.\n$$SNR_{\\text{NB}} = RL - NL_{\\text{NB}} \\approx 100 - 23.2288 = 76.7712\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\n\n**3. SNR Advantage**\nThe SNR advantage of the narrowband strategy over the broadband strategy is the difference in their respective SNRs.\n\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = SNR_{\\text{NB}} - SNR_{\\text{BB}}$$\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = (RL - NL_{\\text{NB}}) - (RL - NL_{\\text{BB}}) = NL_{\\text{BB}} - NL_{\\text{NB}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the noise levels:\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = (NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} + 10 \\log_{10}(B) - DI) - (NL_{1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} + 10 \\log_{10}(\\Delta f) - DI)$$\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = 10 \\log_{10}(B) - 10 \\log_{10}(\\Delta f) = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{B}{\\Delta f}\\right)$$\nThis result, known as the processing gain, is independent of the signal level, noise spectral level, and directivity index, as these factors affect both SNRs equally. Substituting the values for the bandwidths:\n$$B = 200\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$\\Delta f = \\frac{1}{300}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{200}{1/300}\\right) = 10 \\log_{10}(200 \\times 300) = 10 \\log_{10}(60000)$$\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} = 10 \\log_{10}(6 \\times 10^4) = 10(\\log_{10}(6) + \\log_{10}(10^4)) = 10(\\log_{10}(6) + 4)$$\nUsing $\\log_{10}(6) \\approx 0.77815$:\n$$SNR_{\\text{Advantage}} \\approx 10(0.77815 + 4) = 47.7815\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the SNR advantage is $47.78\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.",
