## Introduction
While [linear acoustics](@entry_id:1127264) adeptly describes the propagation of low-amplitude sound, it fails to explain the steady flows and forces that manifest in high-intensity acoustic fields. These phenomena, known as **acoustic streaming** and **[acoustic radiation force](@entry_id:909529)**, are critical second-order consequences of acoustic nonlinearities. Understanding them is essential for a complete picture of acoustic interactions and for leveraging their power in advanced applications. This article bridges the gap between linear theory and real-world effects by providing a comprehensive exploration of these fascinating nonlinear phenomena.

The journey begins in the **Principles and Mechanisms** chapter, where we will deconstruct the underlying physics using [perturbation analysis](@entry_id:178808), differentiate between Eulerian and Lagrangian mean motion, and detail the mechanisms of bulk-driven (Eckart) and boundary-driven (Rayleigh) streaming, as well as the formulation of the [acoustic radiation force](@entry_id:909529) via the Gor'kov potential. Building on this foundation, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will demonstrate how these principles are harnessed for innovation in [microfluidics](@entry_id:269152), biomedical therapies like [sonoporation](@entry_id:907083), and industrial process enhancement. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will provide opportunities to apply these theoretical concepts to practical computational problems, solidifying your understanding of how to model and predict these crucial effects.

## Principles and Mechanisms

While the linear theory of acoustics provides a powerful framework for understanding the propagation of sound waves, a complete description of acoustic phenomena must account for nonlinear effects. These effects, which arise from terms in the governing fluid dynamics equations that are quadratic or higher in the acoustic field variables, become significant at high sound intensities. Although typically small compared to the first-order linear fields, these nonlinearities give rise to a rich set of phenomena that do not exist in linear theory, most notably the generation of steady flows and steady forces. These second-order effects are broadly categorized as **[acoustic streaming](@entry_id:187348)** and **[acoustic radiation force](@entry_id:909529)**. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and physical mechanisms that govern their behavior.

Our analysis is founded on a perturbation expansion of the fluid dynamic variables (velocity $\mathbf{u}$, pressure $p$, density $\rho$) in powers of a small, dimensionless parameter—the acoustic Mach number, $\varepsilon = u_a/c_0$, where $u_a$ is the characteristic amplitude of the acoustic particle velocity and $c_0$ is the small-signal sound speed. For instance, the velocity field is expressed as $\mathbf{u} = \varepsilon \mathbf{u}_1 + \varepsilon^2 \mathbf{u}_2 + \dots$. The first-order terms (subscript 1) represent the familiar linear, oscillatory acoustic field. The second-order terms (subscript 2) contain both oscillatory components at twice the fundamental frequency and, crucially, steady (time-averaged) components that describe streaming and radiation forces.

### Mean Motion: The Eulerian and Lagrangian Viewpoints

Before delving into the mechanisms of streaming, it is essential to distinguish between two different ways of describing mean fluid motion. The most common is the **Eulerian mean velocity**, defined as the [time average](@entry_id:151381) of the fluid velocity at a fixed point in space, $\mathbf{x}$. It is denoted by $\langle \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t) \rangle$, where the angle brackets represent a time average over one or more acoustic periods. For a purely oscillatory first-order field, $\langle \mathbf{u}_1(\mathbf{x},t) \rangle = \mathbf{0}$. Therefore, any non-zero Eulerian mean flow must be a higher-order effect, $\mathbf{U}_E = \langle \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle$. This is the velocity one would measure with a stationary probe.

A second, equally important concept is the **Lagrangian mean velocity**, which describes the [average velocity](@entry_id:267649) of an individual fluid particle as it moves through the fluid. A fluid particle, initially at position $\mathbf{x}_0$, moves along a path $\mathbf{x}(t) = \mathbf{x}_0 + \boldsymbol{\xi}(\mathbf{x}_0, t)$, where $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ is the particle displacement. The Lagrangian velocity is the [time average](@entry_id:151381) of the particle's velocity, $\mathbf{U}_L = \langle d\mathbf{x}/dt \rangle$.

These two mean velocities are not, in general, the same. The difference arises because a particle oscillating in an inhomogeneous sound field experiences a slightly different velocity field at the extremes of its excursion. The relationship between them is given, to second order, by the sum of the Eulerian mean velocity and the **Stokes drift**, $\mathbf{U}_S$:
$$ \mathbf{U}_L = \mathbf{U}_E + \mathbf{U}_S $$
The Stokes drift is a second-order effect arising from the correlation between the first-order particle displacement and the gradient of the first-order velocity field:
$$ \mathbf{U}_S = \langle (\boldsymbol{\xi}_1 \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}_1 \rangle $$
where $\mathbf{u}_1 = \partial_t \boldsymbol{\xi}_1$.

The Stokes drift represents a net transport of mass even when the Eulerian mean flow is zero. A classic example is a one-dimensional progressive (traveling) wave with velocity $u_1(x,t) = u_0 \cos(kx - \omega t)$ . Here, the Eulerian mean is zero, $\langle u_1 \rangle = 0$. However, the first-order displacement is $\xi_1(x,t) = -\frac{u_0}{\omega} \sin(kx - \omega t)$. The Stokes drift is calculated as:
$$ U_S = \langle \xi_1 \partial_x u_1 \rangle = \left\langle \left( -\frac{u_0}{\omega} \sin(kx - \omega t) \right) \left( -u_0 k \sin(kx - \omega t) \right) \right\rangle = \frac{u_0^2 k}{\omega} \langle \sin^2(kx - \omega t) \rangle = \frac{u_0^2 k}{2\omega} $$
Using the dispersion relation $k = \omega/c_0$, this simplifies to a net drift in the direction of wave propagation:
$$ U_S = \frac{u_0^2}{2c_0} $$
This shows that particles in a traveling wave undergo a slow, steady drift in the direction of wave propagation. In contrast, for a pure standing wave, such as $u_1(x,t) = u_0 \cos(kx)\cos(\omega t)$, the Stokes drift is zero everywhere, meaning there is no net mass transport . Understanding this distinction is critical, as [acoustic streaming](@entry_id:187348) refers specifically to the generation of a non-zero *Eulerian* mean flow.

### Acoustic Streaming: Generation of a Steady Eulerian Flow

**Acoustic streaming** is defined as the steady, second-order Eulerian mean flow, $\mathbf{U} \equiv \langle \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle$, generated by the [nonlinear dynamics](@entry_id:140844) of an acoustic field. The physical origin of this flow lies in the time-averaged effect of the nonlinear terms of the Navier-Stokes equations. When the full momentum equation is time-averaged, terms that are quadratic in the first-order oscillatory quantities can have a non-[zero mean](@entry_id:271600), acting as a steady "body force" that drives the streaming flow.

The primary source term for acoustic streaming is the divergence of the **acoustic Reynolds stress tensor**, $\mathbf{\Pi} = \rho_0 \langle \mathbf{u}_1 \mathbf{u}_1 \rangle$. The time-averaged momentum equation for the streaming velocity $\mathbf{U}$ can be written as:
$$ \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{U} - \nabla \langle p_2 \rangle = -\nabla \cdot (\rho_0 \langle \mathbf{u}_1 \mathbf{u}_1 \rangle) $$
This equation reveals a fundamental principle: a [steady streaming](@entry_id:191654) flow $\mathbf{U}$ is generated when a steady body force, $\mathbf{F}_s = -\nabla \cdot (\rho_0 \langle \mathbf{u}_1 \mathbf{u}_1 \rangle)$, is balanced by the viscous stresses and pressure gradients of the mean flow. For this force to be non-zero, the first-order acoustic field must be spatially inhomogeneous. Such inhomogeneity arises primarily from two sources: absorption of the wave in the bulk of the fluid, and the presence of boundaries. These two sources give rise to two distinct classes of streaming.

#### Bulk-Driven (Eckart) Streaming

When an acoustic wave propagates through a viscous fluid, its energy is dissipated and its amplitude attenuates. This attenuation implies a spatial decay of the wave's momentum flux. The conservation of momentum requires that the momentum lost from the wave must be transferred to the fluid, resulting in a steady [body force](@entry_id:184443) in the direction of propagation. This mechanism drives **Eckart streaming**.

Consider a nearly plane wave with intensity $I(x)$ propagating in the $x$-direction. The acoustic momentum flux density is $\Pi_x = I/c_0$. The time-averaged [body force](@entry_id:184443) density is the negative gradient of this momentum flux:
$$ F_x = -\frac{d\Pi_x}{dx} = -\frac{1}{c_0} \frac{dI}{dx} $$
If the wave's amplitude attenuates exponentially with an attenuation coefficient $\alpha$, then its intensity decays as $I(x) = I_0 \exp(-2\alpha x)$. The derivative is $dI/dx = -2\alpha I(x)$, leading to a body force :
$$ F_x(x) = \frac{2\alpha I(x)}{c_0} $$
This steady force drives a streaming flow that is resisted by [viscous forces](@entry_id:263294). In a confined geometry, such as a long duct or channel, this balance creates a characteristic flow profile. For example, in a circular duct of radius $a$, assuming no externally applied pressure gradient, the streaming flow is governed by the steady Stokes equation. This yields a [parabolic velocity profile](@entry_id:270592) with a maximum (centerline) speed of :
$$ U_c(x) = \frac{F_x(x) a^2}{4\mu} = \frac{\alpha a^2 I(x)}{2\mu c_0} $$
Similarly, for a parallel-plate channel of height $H$, the cross-sectionally averaged streaming speed is given by $\bar{U} = \frac{F_x H^2}{12\mu}$ . These results demonstrate that bulk-driven streaming is directly proportional to the rate of acoustic [energy dissipation](@entry_id:147406). If attenuation is zero ($\alpha=0$), the driving force vanishes and there is no Eckart streaming.

#### Boundary-Layer-Driven (Rayleigh) Streaming

A second, often dominant, form of streaming occurs near solid boundaries. The [no-slip condition](@entry_id:275670) at a boundary requires the fluid velocity to be zero. This forces the formation of a thin oscillatory boundary layer, known as the **Stokes boundary layer**, within which the acoustic velocity rapidly drops from its free-field value to zero. The thickness of this layer is determined by the balance between inertial and viscous forces and is given by $\delta_\nu = \sqrt{2\nu/\omega}$, where $\nu=\mu/\rho_0$ is the kinematic viscosity and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

Within this thin layer, the velocity gradients are extremely large. These intense gradients in the first-order acoustic field produce a strong, localized Reynolds stress gradient, which acts as a powerful source driving **Rayleigh streaming**  . This mechanism is distinct from linear thermoviscous attenuation; it is an inherently nonlinear [rectification](@entry_id:197363) of oscillatory stresses within the boundary layer .

Rayleigh streaming is characterized by a two-scale structure. A fast but spatially confined streaming flow is generated within the Stokes layer itself. This "inner" flow acts as a boundary condition for a much larger, but slower, "outer" flow that fills the bulk of the fluid. The result is typically a set of [steady streaming](@entry_id:191654) gyres or vortices. A scaling analysis shows that the [characteristic speed](@entry_id:173770) $U_s$ of these outer streaming gyres depends on the acoustic velocity amplitude $v_a$ and the sound speed $c_0$:
$$ U_s \sim \frac{v_a^2}{c_0} $$
This scaling relationship highlights key features of Rayleigh streaming: it is a second-order effect ($U_s \propto v_a^2$) that is fundamentally dependent on viscosity (which creates the boundary layer), and its structure depends on the geometry of the system. In the inviscid limit ($\nu \to 0$), the Stokes layer vanishes, and so does this streaming mechanism . Numerically simulating this phenomenon requires the grid resolution $h$ and any immersed boundary kernel width $w_{\mathrm{ib}}$ to be smaller than the Stokes layer thickness, i.e., $h, w_{\mathrm{ib}} \lesssim \delta_\nu$, to accurately capture the crucial shear gradients .

#### Streaming Enhancement by Shocks

In the regime of high-amplitude [nonlinear acoustics](@entry_id:200235), an initially sinusoidal wave can progressively steepen as it propagates, eventually forming a [sawtooth wave](@entry_id:159756) containing abrupt, thin transitions known as shock fronts. The competition between [nonlinear steepening](@entry_id:183454) and dissipative effects (like viscosity) is quantified by the **Gol'dberg number**, $\Gamma$. It is the ratio of the attenuation length, $L_a = 1/\alpha$, to the [shock formation distance](@entry_id:1131576), $L_s = \rho_0 c_0^3 / (\beta p_0 \omega)$, where $\beta$ is the [coefficient of nonlinearity](@entry_id:1122598) and $p_0$ is the pressure amplitude . When $\Gamma \gg 1$, nonlinear effects dominate, and [shock formation](@entry_id:194616) is expected.

A shock front is a region of extremely intense dissipation. Consequently, it is also a region where the acoustic momentum flux changes abruptly. As derived from the time-averaged momentum equation, the streaming [body force](@entry_id:184443) can be expressed generally as the negative gradient of the total time-averaged [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796), $f_s(x) = -\partial_x \langle \rho u^2 + p \rangle$ . A shock creates a finite jump in this momentum flux over a very short distance. This makes the shock front a highly concentrated source of body force, which can drive exceptionally strong streaming flows. The total force imparted by the shock is proportional to the jump in momentum flux across it and, to a leading order, is independent of the shock's internal thickness .

### Acoustic Radiation Force

While acoustic streaming describes a mean flow of the host fluid, **[acoustic radiation force](@entry_id:909529)** refers to the steady, time-averaged force exerted by a sound field on an object suspended within the fluid. This force arises from the scattering of the incident acoustic wave by the object. As the wave scatters, its [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796) field is altered. By conservation of momentum, the object must experience a reaction force equal to the net rate of change of momentum of the surrounding sound field.

For a small spherical particle (with radius $a$ much smaller than the acoustic wavelength, $ka \ll 1$), the radiation force can be conveniently calculated as the negative gradient of an [effective potential energy](@entry_id:171609), the **Gor'kov potential** $U$ :
$$ \mathbf{F}_{\text{rad}} = -\nabla U $$
The Gor'kov potential itself is given by the sum of two terms representing the primary scattering mechanisms:
$$ U = V_p \left( \frac{\langle p_1^2 \rangle}{2 \rho_0 c_0^2} f_1 - \frac{3 \rho_0 \langle v_1^2 \rangle}{4} f_2 \right) $$
Here, $V_p = \frac{4}{3}\pi a^3$ is the particle volume, and $\langle p_1^2 \rangle$ and $\langle v_1^2 \rangle$ are the time-averaged squared pressure and velocity of the incident acoustic field at the particle's location. The dimensionless factors $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the **monopole** and **dipole** scattering coefficients, which depend on the contrast in material properties between the particle (compressibility $\kappa_p$, density $\rho_p$) and the fluid (compressibility $\kappa_0$, density $\rho_0$):
$$ f_1 = 1 - \frac{\kappa_p}{\kappa_0} \qquad f_2 = \frac{2(\rho_p - \rho_0)}{2\rho_p + \rho_0} $$
The $f_1$ term, proportional to $\langle p_1^2 \rangle$, represents the force due to the particle's volume pulsation in response to the pressure field (monopole scattering). The $f_2$ term, proportional to $\langle v_1^2 \rangle$, represents the force due to the particle's oscillation as it is dragged by the fluid's velocity field (dipole scattering).

The utility of the Gor'kov potential is powerfully demonstrated in a one-dimensional standing wave field  . In a standing wave, the pressure and velocity fields are spatially out of phase. The time-averaged pressure energy, $\langle p_1^2 \rangle$, is maximal at the pressure antinodes and zero at the pressure nodes. Conversely, the time-averaged kinetic energy, $\langle v_1^2 \rangle$, is maximal at the pressure nodes (velocity antinodes) and zero at the pressure antinodes.

The direction of the radiation force therefore depends on the particle's material properties through $f_1$ and $f_2$.
- If a particle is denser and less compressible than the fluid (e.g., a glass bead in water), then $\rho_p > \rho_0$ and $\kappa_p  \kappa_0$, making both $f_1$ and $f_2$ positive. The particle will seek to minimize its potential energy by moving to a location where both $\langle p_1^2 \rangle$ and $\langle v_1^2 \rangle$ are minimal. In a [standing wave](@entry_id:261209), this corresponds to the pressure nodes.
- Conversely, if a particle is lighter and more compressible than the fluid (e.g., a microbubble in water), then $\rho_p  \rho_0$ and $\kappa_p > \kappa_0$, making $f_1$ negative and $f_2$ negative. The particle will seek to maximize the magnitude of the potential terms, moving towards pressure antinodes where the kinetic energy is zero but the pressure energy is high.

This principle is the basis for acoustic levitation and particle manipulation, where carefully shaped sound fields are used to trap and move small objects without physical contact. The force depends sensitively on the spatial gradients of the acoustic energy densities, highlighting again that inhomogeneity in the acoustic field is the ultimate driver of all second-order acoustic effects.
