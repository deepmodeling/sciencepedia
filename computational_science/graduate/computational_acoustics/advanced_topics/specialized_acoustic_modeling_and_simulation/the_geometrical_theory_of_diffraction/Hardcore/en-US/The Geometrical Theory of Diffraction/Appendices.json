We must compute the Laplacian of $u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}$.\nFirst, the gradient of $u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}$ is:\n$$\\nabla u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = \\nabla(A_{0} \\exp(ikS)) = (\\nabla A_{0}) \\exp(ikS) + A_{0} (ik \\nabla S) \\exp(ikS)$$\n$$\\nabla u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = (\\nabla A_{0} + ik A_{0} \\nabla S) \\exp(ikS)$$\nNext, the divergence of the gradient gives the Laplacian:\n$$\\nabla^{2} u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}) = \\nabla \\cdot [(\\nabla A_{0} + ik A_{0} \\nabla S) \\exp(ikS)]$$\nUsing the product rule for divergence, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\phi \\mathbf{F}) = (\\nabla \\phi) \\cdot \\mathbf{F} + \\phi (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F})$, with $\\phi = \\exp(ikS)$ and $\\mathbf{F} = \\nabla A_{0} + ik A_{0} \\nabla S$:\n$$\\nabla^{2} u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = \\nabla(\\exp(ikS)) \\cdot (\\nabla A_{0} + ik A_{0} \\nabla S) + \\exp(ikS) \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla A_{0} + ik A_{0} \\nabla S)$$\n$$\\nabla^{2} u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = (ik \\nabla S) \\cdot (\\nabla A_{0} + ik A_{0} \\nabla S) \\exp(ikS) + (\\nabla^{2}A_{0} + ik \\nabla \\cdot (A_{0}\\nabla S))\\exp(ikS)$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\\nabla^{2} u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = (ik \\nabla S \\cdot \\nabla A_{0} + (ik)^{2} A_{0} |\\nabla S|^{2}) \\exp(ikS) + (\\nabla^{2}A_{0} + ik (\\nabla A_{0} \\cdot \\nabla S + A_{0}\\nabla^{2}S)) \\exp(ikS)$$\n$$\\nabla^{2} u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = (-k^{2} A_{0} |\\nabla S|^{2} + ik(2\\nabla A_{0} \\cdot \\nabla S + A_{0} \\nabla^{2}S) + \\nabla^{2}A_{0}) \\exp(ikS)$$\nSubstituting this back into the Helmholtz equation $(\\nabla^{2}+k^{2})u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}=0$:\n$$(-k^{2} A_{0} |\\nabla S|^{2} + ik(2\\nabla A_{0} \\cdot \\nabla S + A_{0} \\nabla^{2}S) + \\nabla^{2}A_{0} + k^{2}A_{0}) \\exp(ikS) = 0$$\nDividing by the non-zero exponential term and rearranging by powers of $k$:\n$$k^{2} A_{0}(1 - |\\nabla S|^{2}) + ik(2\\nabla A_{0} \\cdot \\nabla S + A_{0} \\nabla^{2}S) + \\nabla^{2}A_{0} = 0$$\nThe WKB approximation is an asymptotic expansion for large $k$. For this equation to hold, the coefficients of the dominant powers of $k$ must vanish independently.\nEquating the coefficient of the $k^{2}$ term to zero gives the **eikonal equation**:\n$$|\\nabla S|^{2} = 1$$\nEquating the coefficient of the $k$ term to zero gives the **leading-order transport equation**:\n$$2\\nabla A_{0} \\cdot \\nabla S + A_{0} \\nabla^{2}S = 0$$\nThe remaining term, $\\nabla^{2}A_{0}$, is considered to be of a lower order and is neglected in the leading-order approximation.\n\n**Step 2: Solution under Spherical Symmetry**\n\nFor a point source at the origin, the field exhibits spherical symmetry. We thus assume $S(\\mathbf{x}) = S(r)$ and $A_{0}(\\mathbf{x}) = A_{0}(r)$, where $r = |\\mathbf{x}|$.\nIn spherical coordinates, the gradient of a radially symmetric function $f(r)$ is $\\nabla f = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\frac{df}{dr}$.\nThe eikonal equation becomes:\n$$|\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\frac{dS}{dr}|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{dS}{dr}\\right)^{2} = 1$$\nThe solution is $\\frac{dS}{dr} = \\pm 1$, which integrates to $S(r) = \\pm r + S_{c}$. The integration constant $S_c$ represents a constant phase shift and can be absorbed into the amplitude constant, so we set $S_{c}=0$. Thus, $S(r) = \\pm r$.\n\nNow we solve the transport equation. We need the terms $\\nabla A_{0}$, $\\nabla S$, and $\\nabla^{2}S$.\n$\\nabla A_{0} = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\frac{dA_{0}}{dr}$\n$\\nabla S = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\frac{dS}{dr} = \\pm \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$\nThe Laplacian of a radially symmetric function $S(r)$ is $\\nabla^{2}S = \\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^{2}\\frac{dS}{dr}\\right)$.\nUsing $\\frac{dS}{dr} = \\pm 1$, we get:\n$$\\nabla^{2}S = \\frac{1}{r^{2}}\\frac{d}{dr}(r^{2}(\\pm 1)) = \\frac{1}{r^{2}}(\\pm 2r) = \\pm \\frac{2}{r}$$\nSubstituting these into the transport equation:\n$$2\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\frac{dA_{0}}{dr}\\right) \\cdot (\\pm \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) + A_{0} \\left(\\pm \\frac{2}{r}\\right) = 0$$\n$$\\pm 2\\frac{dA_{0}}{dr} \\pm \\frac{2}{r} A_{0} = 0$$\nThis simplifies to the same ordinary differential equation regardless of the sign choice:\n$$\\frac{dA_{0}}{dr} + \\frac{A_{0}}{r} = 0$$\nThis is a separable equation: $\\frac{dA_{0}}{A_{0}} = -\\frac{dr}{r}$. Integrating yields $\\ln A_{0} = -\\ln r + C'$, or $A_{0}(r) = \\frac{\\exp(C')}{r}$. We define a new constant $C_{A} = \\exp(C')$.\nThe solution for the leading-order amplitude is $A_{0}(r) = \\frac{C_{A}}{r}$.\n\n**Step 3: Imposing Conditions and Normalization**\n\nThe WKB solution has the form $u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(r) = \\frac{C_{A}}{r} \\exp(ik(\\pm r))$. The choice of sign in the phase is determined by the Sommerfeld radiation condition for an outgoing wave, which requires $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} r (\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} - iku) = 0$ for a time-harmonic dependence of $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$.\nLet's test the sign.\n$$\\frac{\\partial u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left(\\frac{C_{A}}{r}\\exp(\\pm ikr)\\right) = -\\frac{C_{A}}{r^{2}}\\exp(\\pm ikr) \\pm ik\\frac{C_{A}}{r}\\exp(\\pm ikr) = \\left(-\\frac{1}{r} \\pm ik\\right) u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}$$\nSo, $r\\left(\\frac{\\partial u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}}{\\partial r} - iku\\right) = r\\left(-\\frac{1}{r} \\pm ik - ik\\right)u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}$.\nFor the '$+$' sign: $r\\left(-\\frac{1}{r}\\right)u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = -u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = -\\frac{C_{A}}{r}\\exp(ikr)$, which tends to $0$ as $r\\to\\infty$. This corresponds to an outgoing wave.\nFor the '$-$' sign: $r\\left(-\\frac{1}{r} - 2ik\\right)u_{\\mathrm{WKB}} = (-1 - 2ikr)u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}$, which diverges as $r\\to\\infty$. This corresponds to an incoming wave.\nWe must choose the '$+$' sign, so $S(r) = r$. The solution is $u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(r) = \\frac{C_{A}}{r}\\exp(ikr)$.\n\nThe problem specifies normalization by matching this to the exact outgoing spherical wave $u_{\\mathrm{exact}}(r) = \\frac{\\exp(ikr)}{r}$.\nComparing the two expressions, we see that the constant $C_{A}$ must be $1$.\nTherefore, the normalized leading-order WKB solution is:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(r) = \\frac{1}{r}\\exp(ikr)$$\n\n**Step 4: Error Analysis**\n\nThe relative error is defined as $E(k,r) = \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(r) - u_{\\mathrm{exact}}(r)}{u_{\\mathrm{exact}}(r)}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $u_{\\mathrm{WKB}}(r)$ and $u_{\\mathrm{exact}}(r)$:\n$$E(k,r) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{r}\\exp(ikr) - \\frac{1}{r}\\exp(ikr)}{\\frac{1}{r}\\exp(ikr)}$$\nThe numerator is identically zero for all $r>0$.\n$$E(k,r) = 0$$\nThis result stems from a specific feature of the three-dimensional Helmholtz equation in a homogeneous medium. The WKB approximation procedure, when applied to this problem, yields the exact solution. The term $\\nabla^{2}A_0$ that was neglected in the derivation of the transport equation is, in fact, zero for the solution $A_{0}(r)=1/r$ (for $r \\neq 0$), since $\\nabla^{2}(1/r) = -4\\pi\\delta(\\mathbf{x})$, which is zero away from the origin. Consequently, the leading-order WKB solution satisfies the Helmholtz equation exactly, not just asymptotically.\n\nThe problem asks for the leading-order asymptotic term of $E(k,r)$ as $kr\\to\\infty$. Since the error $E(k,r)$ is identically zero for all relevant $k$ and $r$, its asymptotic expansion is also identically zero. The leading-order term of a function that is identically zero is zero itself.",

            "solution": "The solution proceeds by analyzing the scaling of the diffracted pressure for the vertex and edge cases separately, based on the principles of the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD).\n\n**1. Vertex Diffraction Scaling ($|p_{\\mathrm{v}}|$ )**\n\nAccording to GTD, a diffracted field can be calculated by considering the incident field at the point of diffraction, which then acts as a secondary source. For vertex diffraction, the diffracted field $p_{\\mathrm{v}}$ at a receiver location is given by:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{v}} \\approx p_{\\mathrm{inc}}(V) \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{v}} \\cdot A_{\\mathrm{v}}(s_{\\mathrm{d}}) \\cdot \\exp(i k s_{\\mathrm{d}}) $$\nwhere $V$ is the vertex location, $p_{\\mathrm{inc}}(V)$ is the incident pressure at the vertex, $D_{\\mathrm{v}}$ is the vertex diffraction coefficient, $s_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is the distance from the vertex to the receiver, and $A_{\\mathrm{v}}(s_{\\mathrm{d}})$ is the spatial spreading factor of the diffracted wave.\n\n-   **Incident Field**: The source is a point source at a distance $s_{\\mathrm{i}} = R$ from the vertex. The magnitude of the incident pressure at the vertex is inversely proportional to this distance:\n    $$ |p_{\\mathrm{inc}}(V)| \\propto \\frac{1}{s_{\\mathrm{i}}} = \\frac{1}{R} $$\n\n-   **Spreading Factor**: The vertex acts as a point diffractor, radiating a spherical wave. The amplitude of this spherical wave decays inversely with the distance $s_{\\mathrm{d}}$ from the vertex. The receiver is at a distance $s_{\\mathrm{d}} = R$ from the vertex. Thus, the spreading factor has a magnitude:\n    $$ |A_{\\mathrm{v}}(R)| = \\frac{1}{R} $$\n\n-   **Diffraction Coefficient**: The vertex diffraction coefficient $D_{\\mathrm{v}}$ depends on the geometry of the corner and the angles of incidence and diffraction. Crucially, its magnitude scales with the wavenumber $k$. The diffracted field arises from a stationary phase evaluation of a two-dimensional physical optics integral over the surface area near the vertex. This evaluation introduces a factor of $k^{-1}$. Therefore, the magnitude of the vertex diffraction coefficient has the following scaling:\n    $$ |D_{\\mathrm{v}}| \\propto \\frac{1}{k} $$\n\n-   **Total Scaling for $|p_{\\mathrm{v}}|$**: Combining these factors, the magnitude of the vertex-diffracted pressure at the receiver scales as:\n    $$ |p_{\\mathrm{v}}| \\propto |p_{\\mathrm{inc}}(V)| \\cdot |D_{\\mathrm{v}}| \\cdot |A_{\\mathrm{v}}(R)| \\propto \\frac{1}{R} \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{1}{k R^2} $$\n\n**2. Edge Diffraction Scaling ($|p_{\\mathrm{e}}|$ )**\n\nFor edge diffraction, the diffracted field $p_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is given by a similar GTD expression:\n$$ p_{\\mathrm{e}} \\approx p_{\\mathrm{inc}}(Q) \\cdot D_{\\mathrm{e}} \\cdot A_{\\mathrm{e}}(s_{\\mathrm{d}}) \\cdot \\exp(i k s_{\\mathrm{d}}) $$\nwhere $Q$ is the point of diffraction on the edge, $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the edge diffraction coefficient, and $A_{\\mathrm{e}}(s_{\\mathrm{d}})$ is the corresponding spreading factor.\n\n-   **Path Lengths**: The problem specifies an \"identical source and receiver geometry\" and that the \"total diffracted path length is comparable to $R$\". This implies that both the incident path length $s_{\\mathrm{i}}$ (source to edge) and the diffracted path length $s_{\\mathrm{d}}$ (edge to receiver) are on the order of $R$. We thus take $s_{\\mathrm{i}} \\sim R$ and $s_{\\mathrm{d}} \\sim R$.\n\n-   **Incident Field and Spreading Factor**: The incident field at the edge is from a point source, so $|p_{\\mathrm{inc}}(Q)| \\propto 1/s_{\\mathrm{i}}$. The diffracted wave from a straight edge excited by a spherical wave has a principal radius of curvature that grows linearly with distance $s_{\\mathrm{d}}$ from the edge, while the other principal radius of curvature depends on the distance from the source. The combined effect is described by an astigmatic ray tube. The amplitude attenuation for the total path from source to receiver via edge diffraction is given by:\n    $$ \\frac{|p_{\\mathrm{e}}|}{|S|} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{i}} s_{\\mathrm{d}} (s_{\\mathrm{i}} + s_{\\mathrm{d}})}} $$\n    With $s_{\\mathrm{i}} \\sim R$ and $s_{\\mathrm{d}} \\sim R$, the spatial attenuation scales as:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R \\cdot R \\cdot (R+R)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 R^3}} \\propto \\frac{1}{R^{3/2}} $$\n\n-   **Diffraction Coefficient**: The edge diffraction coefficient $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ arises from a one-dimensional stationary phase evaluation of the physical optics integral along the edge. This evaluation introduces a factor of $k^{-1/2}$. Thus, the magnitude of the edge diffraction process itself contributes a scaling factor:\n    $$ |D_{\\mathrm{e}}| \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} $$\n\n-   **Total Scaling for $|p_{\\mathrm{e}}|$**: Combining the spatial and frequency-dependent scalings, we get:\n    $$ |p_{\\mathrm{e}}| \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{R^{3/2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k} R^{3/2}} $$\n\n**3. Ratio of Magnitudes ($|p_{\\mathrm{v}}| / |p_{\\mathrm{e}}|$ )**\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the vertex-diffracted pressure magnitude to the edge-diffracted pressure magnitude. The problem statement allows us to neglect all order-unity constants, focusing only on the scaling with $k$ and $R$.\n$$ \\frac{|p_{\\mathrm{v}}|}{|p_{\\mathrm{e}}|} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{v}} (k R^2)^{-1}}{C_{\\mathrm{e}} (k^{1/2} R^{3/2})^{-1}} $$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{v}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{e}}$ are order-unity constants which we neglect.\n$$ \\frac{|p_{\\mathrm{v}}|}{|p_{\\mathrm{e}}|} \\propto \\frac{k^{1/2} R^{3/2}}{k R^2} = k^{1/2 - 1} R^{3/2 - 2} = k^{-1/2} R^{-1/2} = (kR)^{-1/2} $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{kR}} $$\nThis result confirms the fundamental hierarchy in GTD: in the high-frequency limit ($kR \\gg 1$), the vertex-diffracted field is asymptotically smaller than the edge-diffracted field.",
