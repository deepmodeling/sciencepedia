Two experiments are performed:\n\n- Experiment A (moving source, fixed receiver): The source moves at constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ along a straight line toward a fixed receiver located at $\\mathbf{x}_{r}$ in free space. The source position is $\\mathbf{x}_{s}(t) = \\mathbf{x}_{s}(0) + \\mathbf{v} t$, and the emission drives the inhomogeneous linear acoustic wave equation with a point source at $\\mathbf{x}_{s}(t)$.\n\n- Experiment B (fixed source, moving receiver): The source is fixed at $\\mathbf{x}_{s}$ and emits the same narrowband signal $s(t) = \\exp(i \\omega_{0} t)$, while the receiver moves at the same constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ along the same straight line, now toward the fixed source.

This relationship is governed by the propagation delay. The signal travels a distance $\\|\\mathbf{x}_r(t_r) - \\mathbf{x}_s(t_e)\\|$ at the speed of sound $c$. Thus, the receiver time $t_r$ is the sum of the emission time $t_e$ and the travel time:\n$$t_r = t_e + \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{x}_r(t_r) - \\mathbf{x}_s(t_e)\\|}{c}$$\nThe source emits a signal with complex baseband $s(t) = \\exp(i \\omega_{0} t)$. The phase of the signal received at time $t_r$ is determined by the phase of the source at the corresponding emission time $t_e(t_r)$. The received signal's phase is therefore $\\phi(t_r) = \\omega_{0} t_e(t_r)$.\n\nThe instantaneous angular frequency observed by the receiver, $\\omega_r$, is the time derivative of the phase with respect to the receiver's time $t_r$:\n$$\\omega_r(t_r) = \\frac{d\\phi(t_r)}{dt_r} = \\frac{d}{dt_r} (\\omega_{0} t_e(t_r)) = \\omega_{0} \\frac{dt_e}{dt_r}$$\nThe observed frequency $f_r$ is related to the source frequency $f_0$ by $f_r = f_0 \\frac{dt_e}{dt_r}$.

            "solution": "The solution proceeds by first identifying the analytical domain of dependence, which is determined by the characteristic speeds of the governing partial differential equation (PDE).\n\n1.  **Finding Characteristic Speeds**\n\nWe look for plane-wave solutions to the convected wave equation of the form $p(x,t) = P_0 \\exp(i(kx - \\omega t))$, where $k$ is the wavenumber and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = -i\\omega p, \\quad \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = ikp, \\quad \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} = (ik)^2 p = -k^2 p.\n$$\nThe operator $(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x})$ acting on $p$ yields:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)p = (-i\\omega + U(ik))p = i(Uk - \\omega)p\n$$\nApplying this operator twice gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 p = (i(Uk - \\omega))^2 p = -(Uk - \\omega)^2 p\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the original PDE:\n$$\n-(Uk - \\omega)^2 p - c^2(-k^2 p) = 0\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial solution ($p \\neq 0$), we obtain the dispersion relation:\n$$\n(Uk - \\omega)^2 = c^2 k^2\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n$$\nUk - \\omega = \\pm ck\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\omega = Uk \\mp ck = (U \\mp c)k\n$$\nThe speeds at which information propagates are the characteristic speeds, which for this linear, non-dispersive equation are equal to the phase speeds $v_p = \\omega/k$. Thus, there are two characteristic speeds:\n$$\nv_{+} = U + c\n$$\n$$\nv_{-} = U - c\n$$\nThese speeds represent the propagation of sound waves downstream (with the flow) and upstream (against the flow), respectively, as observed in the stationary frame of the grid.\n\n2.  **Applying the CFL Condition**\n\nThe CFL condition stipulates that for an explicit numerical scheme to be stable, the numerical domain of dependence must encompass the analytical (or physical) domain of dependence. For a nearest-neighbor stencil, a numerical value at grid point $x_j$ and time $t_{n+1}$ is computed using information from points $x_{j-1}$, $x_j$, and $x_{j+1}$ at time $t_n$. The numerical domain of dependence is the interval $[x_{j-1}, x_{j+1}]$, of width $2\\Delta x$.\n\nA more direct way to apply the CFL principle is to require that the fastest physical wave speed does not exceed the \"numerical propagation speed,\" which is the grid spacing divided by the time step, $\\Delta x / \\Delta t$. The fastest physical speed relative to the stationary grid, $v_{\\max}$, is the maximum of the absolute values of the characteristic speeds:\n$$\nv_{\\max} = \\max(|v_{+}|, |v_{-}|) = \\max(|U+c|, |U-c|)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $U$ and $c$ are positive constants. The problem also asks for the result in terms of $\\|U\\| = |U|$. Let's use $|U|$ for generality, as the physical principle holds regardless of the direction of the flow.\n$$\nv_{\\max} = \\max(|U|+c, ||U|-c|)\n$$\nBy the properties of absolute values, for any real numbers $a, b \\ge 0$, we have $a+b \\ge |a-b|$. Therefore, $|U|+c \\ge ||U|-c|$. The equality holds only if $c=0$ or $|U|=0$, which are not the general case. Thus, the maximum speed is always given by the sum of the magnitudes:\n$$\nv_{\\max} = |U| + c\n$$\nThe CFL condition is therefore:\n$$\nv_{\\max} \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1\n$$\n$$\n(|U| + c) \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1\n$$\nSolving for the maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, gives the desired closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{|U| + c}\n$$\n\n3.  **Limiting Form as $\\|U\\| \\to c$**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the limit of $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ as the flow speed magnitude $|U|$ approaches the speed of sound $c$.\n$$\n\\lim_{|U| \\to c} \\Delta t_{\\max} = \\lim_{|U| \\to c} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta x}{|U| + c} \\right)\n$$\nSince the expression is a continuous function of $|U|$ at $|U|=c$ (given $c0$), we can evaluate the limit by direct substitution:\n$$\n\\lim_{|U| \\to c} \\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{c + c} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2c}\n$$\n\n4.  **Physical and Numerical Implications**\n\nThe case $|U| \\to c$ corresponds to a Mach number $M = |U|/c$ approaching $1$, which describes a sonic or transonic flow regime.\n\n**Physical Implications**:\n- In a sonic flow where $|U|=c$, one of the characteristic speeds becomes zero ($v_{-} = U-c = 0$ if $U=c  0$), while the other becomes twice the sound speed ($v_{+} = U+c = 2c$).\n- The zero-speed characteristic signifies that waves attempting to propagate upstream are held stationary by the opposing flow. This is the physical basis for the formation of a sonic boom or shock wave in a real, nonlinear fluid, as acoustic energy accumulates at a fixed location relative to the flow.\n- The downstream-propagating waves move at a speed of $2c$ relative to a stationary observer. This is the fastest speed at which disturbances can propagate in this system.\n\n**Numerical Implications**:\n- The limiting stable time step is $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\Delta x / (2c)$. Comparing this to the case with no flow ($U=0$), where $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\Delta x/c$, we see that the time step must be halved to maintain stability in a sonic flow.\n- This imposes a more stringent stability constraint, increasing the computational cost of the simulation. To simulate a given duration of physical time, a simulation of a sonic flow requires twice as many time steps as a simulation of a stationary medium with the same spatial resolution $\\Delta x$.\n- This result highlights a key challenge in the computational modeling of moving sources and observers. As the relative speed between the source/observer and the medium increases, the CFL condition becomes more restrictive because the stability limit is governed by the sum of the flow speed and sound speed, $|U|+c$.\n- Furthermore, for such advection-dominated problems ($|U| \\ge c$), simple centered-difference schemes (a common choice for nearest-neighbor stencils) are prone to severe numerical oscillations and instabilities. While the CFL condition derived here is a necessary condition for stability for any explicit nearest-neighbor scheme, it is not sufficient. Accurate and stable simulations in the transonic regime typically require more advanced numerical techniques, such as upwind schemes or flux-limiter methods, to properly handle the directional nature of information propagation.",

To find this direction, we must determine the source's position when it emitted the signal that arrives at $x=0$ at $t=0$.

At this emission time, the source position was $\\mathbf{r}_s(t_r(0)) = (0, R_0 + v t_r(0))$. Since the $x$-coordinate is $0$, the source was on the $y$-axis. The signal arriving at the sensor at $x=0$ therefore propagates along the $y$-axis, which is normal to the sensor array on the $x$-axis.\n\nA plane wave arriving at normal incidence has a constant phase across the $x$-axis.

Its maximum absolute value across the aperture $x \\in [-D/2, D/2]$ occurs at the endpoints $x=\\pm D/2$:\n$$\n\\max_{x \\in [-D/2,D/2]} |\\Delta \\phi(x)| = \\frac{\\omega_{0}(D/2)^2}{2cR_{0}} = \\frac{\\omega_{0}D^2}{8cR_{0}}\n$$\nThe far-field assumption is considered valid as long as this maximum error does not exceed the tolerance $\\varepsilon$. The minimal distance $R_{0,\\min}$ corresponds to the case where the maximum error equals the tolerance:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega_{0}D^2}{8cR_{0,\\min}} = \\varepsilon\n$$\nSolving for $R_{0,\\min}$:\n$$\nR_{0,\\min} = \\frac{\\omega_{0}D^2}{8c\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in terms of the aperture $D$, the acoustic wavelength $\\lambda_{0} \\equiv 2\\pi c/\\omega_{0}$, and the tolerance $\\varepsilon$. We can substitute $\\omega_{0}/c = 2\\pi/\\lambda_{0}$ into the expression for $R_{0,\\min}$:\n$$\nR_{0,\\min} = \\frac{D^2}{8\\varepsilon} \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{0}}{c}\\right) = \\frac{D^2}{8\\varepsilon} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nR_{0,\\min} = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4\\lambda_{0}\\varepsilon}\n$$\nThis result is analogous to the Fraunhofer distance criterion in optics and antenna theory, defining the boundary between the near-field and far-field, where the wavefront can be approximated as planar. The derivation shows that, to the second order, the effect of source motion on this specific phase error metric vanishes at the point of closest approach.",
