            "problem": "Consider small-amplitude ultrasound propagation in a Newtonian fluid governed by the linearized, thermoviscous limit of the Westervelt equation. Starting from the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, together with Newtonian viscosity and Fourier heat conduction, one arrives at a linear wave equation with a dissipative correction that is third order in time. In this framework, the dissipation is characterized by a sound diffusivity $\\delta$ that depends on shear viscosity, bulk viscosity, and thermal effects. For a plane, time-harmonic pressure wave $p(x,t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{p}\\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]\\}$, the complex wavenumber $k$ determines the attenuation coefficient $\\alpha$ via $\\alpha = \\Im\\{k\\}$.\n\n1.

It presents a standard problem in physical acoustics concerning thermoviscous dissipation. All necessary physical quantities and thermodynamic relations are provided, enabling a unique and meaningful solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Sound Diffusivity and Attenuation Coefficient**\n\nThe propagation of sound in a thermoviscous fluid is governed by the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy, augmented by constitutive relations for stress (Newtonian fluid) and heat flux (Fourier's law). For small-amplitude perturbations, these equations can be linearized. Combining these linearized equations yields a single partial differential equation for the acoustic pressure perturbation, $p$. This equation takes the form of a wave equation with a dissipative term, often referred to as the thermoviscous wave equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 p - \\frac{1}{c_0^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} + \\frac{\\delta}{c_0^4} \\frac{\\partial^3 p}{\\partial t^3} = 0 $$\nwhere $c_0$ is the small-signal (isentropic) speed of sound and $\\delta$ is the sound diffusivity.\n\nThe sound diffusivity, $\\delta$, consolidates the effects of viscosity and thermal conduction. Its expression is derived by accounting for the dissipative terms arising from the momentum and energy equations. The viscous stress tensor in the linearized momentum equation contributes a term proportional to the bulk viscosity, $\\mu_b$, and the shear viscosity, $\\mu$. The heat conduction in the linearized energy equation, coupled with thermodynamic state relations, contributes a term proportional to the thermal conductivity, $\\kappa$. The resulting expression for the sound diffusivity is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ \\delta = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\left( \\mu_b + \\frac{4}{3}\\mu \\right) + \\frac{\\kappa}{\\rho_0 c_p} (\\gamma - 1) $$\nHere, $\\rho_0$ is the equilibrium density, $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $\\gamma = c_p/c_v$ is the ratio of specific heats ($c_v$ being the specific heat at constant volume). The first term represents dissipation due to viscosity, and the second represents dissipation due to thermal conduction.\n\nNext, we derive the leading-order formula for the attenuation coefficient, $\\alpha$. We consider a plane, time-harmonic pressure wave propagating in the $x$-direction, given by the ansatz $p(x,t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{p}\\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]\\}$, where $\\hat{p}$ is the complex amplitude, $k$ is the complex wavenumber, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. Substituting this into the thermoviscous wave equation yields the dispersion relation for $k$:\n$$ (ik)^2 p - \\frac{1}{c_0^2}(-i\\omega)^2 p + \\frac{\\delta}{c_0^4}(-i\\omega)^3 p = 0 $$\nDividing by $p$ (assuming $p \\neq 0$), we get:\n$$ -k^2 + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c_0^2} + i \\frac{\\omega^3 \\delta}{c_0^4} = 0 $$\n$$ k^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2}{c_0^2} \\left( 1 + i \\frac{\\omega \\delta}{c_0^2} \\right) $$\nSolving for $k$:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\omega}{c_0} \\sqrt{1 + i \\frac{\\omega \\delta}{c_0^2}} $$\nFor small losses, the dissipative term is small, i.e., $\\omega \\delta / c_0^2 \\ll 1$. We can therefore use the first-order Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+z} \\approx 1 + z/2$ for small $z$. Let $z = i \\omega \\delta / c_0^2$.\n$$ k \\approx \\frac{\\omega}{c_0} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{2} i \\frac{\\omega \\delta}{c_0^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\omega}{c_0} + i \\frac{\\omega^2 \\delta}{2c_0^3} $$\nThe attenuation coefficient $\\alpha$ is defined as the imaginary part of the wavenumber, $\\alpha = \\Im\\{k\\}$. Thus, the leading-order small-loss formula for $\\alpha$ is:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\omega^2 \\delta}{2c_0^3} $$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation for Water**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the ratio of specific heats, $\\gamma$. The problem provides the thermodynamic identity $\\gamma - 1 = \\alpha_T^{2} T / (\\rho_0 c_p \\kappa_T)$, where $\\alpha_T$ is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient. Using the provided values:\n- $\\alpha_T = 2.07 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 293.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\rho_0 = 998\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $c_p = 4182\\ \\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $\\kappa_T = 4.6 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{Pa^{-1}}$\n\n$$ \\gamma - 1 = \\frac{(2.07 \\times 10^{-4})^2 \\times 293.15}{998 \\times 4182 \\times (4.6 \\times 10^{-10})} = \\frac{1.25593 \\times 10^{-5}}{1.92111 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 0.00653744 $$\nThis value for $\\gamma-1$ is small, as expected for a liquid where $c_p \\approx c_v$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the sound diffusivity, $\\delta$, using its derived expression.

The angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$. We use the derived formula for $\\alpha$ along with $c_0 = 1482\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and the unrounded value for $\\delta$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\omega^2 \\delta}{2c_0^3} = \\frac{(2\\pi \\times 10^6)^2 \\times (4.145226 \\times 10^{-6})}{2 \\times (1482)^3} $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{(3.94784 \\times 10^{13}) \\times (4.145226 \\times 10^{-6})}{2 \\times (3.25533 \\times 10^9)} = \\frac{1.63653 \\times 10^8}{6.51066 \\times 10^9} \\approx 0.025136\\ \\mathrm{Np\\,m^{-1}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\alpha = 0.02514\\ \\mathrm{Np\\,m^{-1}}$.\n\nTherefore, the sound diffusivity $\\delta$ is $4.145 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$ and the attenuation coefficient $\\alpha$ is $0.02514\\ \\mathrm{Np\\,m^{-1}}$.",

If we consider a wave with characteristic dimensionless amplitude and frequency of order unity, the nonlinear term is of order $N$ and the dissipative term is of order $\\Sigma$. Thus, the competition is governed by the ratio $N/\\Sigma$.\n- If $N \\gg \\Sigma$, nonlinearity dominates, leading to wave steepening and potential shock formation.\n- If $\\Sigma \\gg N$, dissipation dominates, and the wave attenuates before significant steepening occurs.\n- The transition between these regimes occurs when $N$ and $\\Sigma$ are of the same order, i.e., $N/\\Sigma = \\mathcal{O}(1)$. This ratio is known as the Gol'dberg number.\n\nAn alternative, complementary approach is to compare the characteristic length scales for each process.\n1.  **Nonlinear steepening length, $L_s$**: For an initially sinusoidal wave of angular frequency $\\omega$, the distance at which a shock would form in a lossless medium is $L_s = \\frac{\\rho_0 c_0^3}{\\beta \\omega P}$. Using $\\omega=2\\pi/T$ and $N=\\beta P/(\\rho_0 c_0^2)$, we find $L_s = \\frac{\\rho_0 c_0^3}{(\\rho_0 c_0^2 N/P)(2\\pi/T)} = \\frac{c_0 P T}{2\\pi N}$. This scaling seems off in my re-derivation. Let's re-do it carefully.\n    $N = \\frac{\\beta P}{\\rho_0 c_0^2} \\implies \\frac{\\beta P}{\\rho_0} = N c_0^2$.\n    $L_s = \\frac{\\rho_0 c_0^3}{\\beta \\omega P} = \\frac{c_0^3}{\\omega (\\beta P/\\rho_0)} = \\frac{c_0^3}{\\omega (N c_0^2)} = \\frac{c_0}{N \\omega}$.\n    Using $\\omega = 2\\pi/T$ and $\\lambda = c_0 T$, $L_s = \\frac{c_0 T}{2\\pi N} = \\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi N}$. Thus, $L_s \\sim c_0 T/N$. The solution text is correct.\n2.  **Attenuation length, $L_a$**: The thermoviscous attenuation coefficient is $\\alpha = \\frac{\\delta \\omega^2}{2 c_0^3}$. The characteristic attenuation length is $L_a = 1/\\alpha = \\frac{2 c_0^3}{\\delta \\omega^2}$. Using $\\omega=2\\pi/T$ and $\\Sigma=\\delta/(c_0^2 T)$, we find $L_a = \\frac{2 c_0^3}{(\\Sigma c_0^2 T)(4\\pi^2/T^2)} = \\frac{c_0 T}{2\\pi^2\\Sigma}$. Thus, $L_a \\sim c_0 T/\\Sigma$. The solution text is correct.\n\nNonlinear steepening will be the dominant effect if it occurs over a much shorter distance than attenuation, i.e., $L_s \\ll L_a$. This implies $\\frac{c_0 T}{N} \\ll \\frac{c_0 T}{\\Sigma}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{N} \\ll \\frac{1}{\\Sigma}$, or $N \\gg \\Sigma$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Upon nondimensionalization with $x = c_0 T \\xi$, $t = T\\tau$, and $p = P\\pi$, the quadratic nonlinearity and thermoviscous terms enter the dimensionless Westervelt equation as $-N \\frac{\\partial^2(\\pi^2)}{\\partial \\tau^2}$ and $\\Sigma \\frac{\\partial^3 \\pi}{\\partial \\tau^3}$, with $N = \\beta P/(\\rho_0 c_0^2)$ and $\\Sigma = \\delta/(c_0^2 T)$. Nonlinear steepening dominates if $N \\gg \\Sigma$, attenuation dominates if $\\Sigma \\gg N$, and the transition occurs when $N/\\Sigma = \\mathcal{O}(1)$.**\nMy derivation of the dimensionless Westervelt equation yields $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\pi}{\\partial \\xi^2} - \\frac{\\partial^2 \\pi}{\\partial \\tau^2} + \\Sigma \\frac{\\partial^3 \\pi}{\\partial \\tau^3} = - N \\frac{\\partial^2 (\\pi^2)}{\\partial \\tau^2}$. This form precisely matches the claim that the thermoviscous term enters with a prefactor of $+\\Sigma$ and the nonlinear term enters on the opposing side with a prefactor of $-N$. The remainder of the statement accurately describes the physical competition between nonlinearity and dissipation as governed by the ratio $N/\\Sigma$. The entire statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The balance between nonlinear steepening and attenuation is controlled by the product $N\\Sigma$; steepening dominates if $N\\Sigma \\gg 1$, and attenuation dominates if $N\\Sigma \\ll 1$.**\nAs established in the derivation, the balance is controlled by the ratio $N/\\Sigma$, not the product $N\\Sigma$. The ratio compares the relative magnitudes of the two effects. The product would not represent this competition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. For any value of $\\Sigma$, the shock formation distance scales as $L_s \\sim c_0 T \\Sigma$, so dissipation accelerates steepening in direct proportion to $\\Sigma$.**\nThe lossless shock formation distance scales as $L_s \\sim c_0 T/N$. The claim that it scales as $L_s \\sim c_0 T \\Sigma$ is false. Furthermore, dissipation (represented by $\\Sigma$) is a diffusive process that counteracts the formation of sharp gradients. It therefore delays or prevents shock formation, it does not accelerate it. The physical reasoning is inverted.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If $N > 1$, nonlinear steepening necessarily produces a shock within a distance shorter than a wavelength, regardless of the magnitude of $\\Sigma$.**\nThis statement is false because it ignores the role of dissipation. Shock formation requires that the rate of steepening overcomes the rate of attenuation. This is true only if the Gol'dberg number $\\Gamma = N/\\Sigma$ is sufficiently large (typically $\\Gamma > 1$). If dissipation is strong enough such that $\\Sigma \\gg N$, no shock will form, regardless of how large $N$ is. The phrase \"regardless of the magnitude of $\\Sigma$\" is a critical error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. For a quasi-monochromatic wave with angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi/T$, balancing the nonlinear and dissipative scales gives $L_s \\sim c_0 T/N$ and $L_a \\sim c_0 T/\\Sigma$; steepening dominates when $L_s \\ll L_a$, equivalently when $N \\gg \\Sigma$.**\nThis statement provides a physically intuitive derivation for the competition between nonlinearity and dissipation by comparing their characteristic length scales. As shown in the derivation above, the scaling relations for the shock formation distance ($L_s \\sim c_0 T/N$) and the attenuation length ($L_a \\sim c_0 T/\\Sigma$) are correct. The condition for the dominance of nonlinear steepening is correctly identified as $L_s \\ll L_a$, which is correctly shown to be equivalent to $N \\gg \\Sigma$. This statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct**",
