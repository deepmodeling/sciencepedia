            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a standard question in the field of computational fluid dynamics concerning the solution of a Riemann problem for the inviscid Burgers equation. All necessary information is provided, and the requested quantity is well-defined.\n\nThe governing equation is the inviscid Burgers equation, a scalar conservation law of the form $u_{t} + f(u)_{x} = 0$, where $u(x,t)$ is the conserved variable and $f(u)$ is the flux function.\nFor this problem, the flux function is given by\n$$\nf(u) = \\frac{1}{2} u^{2}\n$$\nThe problem considers the exact solution to the Riemann problem with initial data consisting of two constant states, $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$, separated by a discontinuity at $x=0$:\n$$\nu(x,0) = \\begin{cases}\nu_{L} = 1.5, & x<0 \\\\\nu_{R} = -0.5, & x>0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe solution to this Riemann problem is self-similar, meaning it depends only on the ratio $\\xi = x/t$. The nature of the solution, whether it is a shock wave or a rarefaction wave, is determined by the characteristic speeds associated with the left and right states. The characteristic speed, $a(u)$, is given by the derivative of the flux function:\n$$\na(u) = f'(u) = \\frac{d}{du}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} u^{2}\\right) = u\n$$\nWe evaluate the characteristic speeds for the given left and right states:\n$$\na(u_{L}) = u_{L} = 1.5\n$$\n$$\na(u_{R}) = u_{R} = -0.5\n$$\nSince $a(u_{L}) > a(u_{R})$ (that is, $1.5 > -0.5$), the characteristics are converging, which leads to the formation of a discontinuous solution known as a shock wave. If the characteristics were diverging ($a(u_{L}) < a(u_{R})$), the solution would be a continuous rarefaction wave.\n\nFor a shock wave, the speed of the discontinuity, $s$, must satisfy the Rankine–Hugoniot jump condition. This condition ensures that the integral form of the conservation law is satisfied across the discontinuity. It is given by:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta u} = \\frac{f(u_{R}) - f(u_{L})}{u_{R} - u_{L}}\n$$\nWe first compute the flux values for the left and right states:\n$$\nf(u_{L}) = f(1.5) = \\frac{1}{2} (1.5)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (2.25) = 1.125\n$$\n$$\nf(u_{R}) = f(-0.5) = \\frac{1}{2} (-0.5)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.25) = 0.125\n$$\nNow, we substitute these values along with $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$ into the Rankine–Hugoniot condition to find the shock speed $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{0.125 - 1.125}{-0.5 - 1.5} = \\frac{-1.0}{-2.0} = 0.5\n$$\nThe shock speed is $s = 0.5$. Since $s > 0$, the shock wave propagates to the right, into the region where $x > 0$. The self-similar solution for $u(x,t)$ is thus given by:\n$$\nu(x,t) = u(x/t) = \\begin{cases}\nu_{L} = 1.5, & \\text{if } x/t < s = 0.5 \\\\\nu_{R} = -0.5, & \\text{if } x/t > s = 0.5\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe Godunov intercell flux, $F_{G}$, is defined as the physical flux evaluated at the cell interface, which is located at $x=0$, for any time $t > 0$. We need to determine the value of the state $u$ at this location, i.e., $u(0,t)$. This corresponds to the self-similar variable value $\\xi = x/t = 0/t = 0$.\n\nAccording to the shock solution structure, we must compare $\\xi=0$ to the shock speed $s=0.5$. Since $0 < 0.5$, the position $x=0$ lies in the region where the state is $u_{L}$.\nTherefore, for any $t>0$, the state at the interface is:\n$$\nu(0,t) = u_{L} = 1.5\n$$\nThe Godunov flux $F_{G}$ is the physical flux $f(u)$ evaluated at this state:\n$$\nF_{G} = f(u(0,t)) = f(u_{L}) = f(1.5)\n$$\nUsing our previously calculated value for $f(1.5)$:\n$$\nF_{G} = 1.125\n$$\nThis is the value of the intercell numerical flux for the given Riemann problem.",

This result is expected, as the data points lie on a straight line, and the limiter correctly reproduces the gradient of that line.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the interface states $p_{i,-}^{R}$ and $p_{i,+}^{L}$**\n\nNext, we use the calculated slope $s_i$ to find the reconstructed pressure values at the cell interfaces.\n\nThe right state at the left interface, $p_{i,-}^{R}$, is calculated using the formula:\n$$ p_{i,-}^{R} = p_{i} - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} s_{i} $$\nSubstituting the given and calculated values:\n$$ p_{i,-}^{R} = 200 - \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 200 - 50 = 150\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n\nThe left state at the right interface, $p_{i,+}^{L}$, is calculated using the formula:\n$$ p_{i,+}^{L} = p_{i} + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} s_{i} $$\nSubstituting the given and calculated values:\n$$ p_{i,+}^{L} = 200 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 100 = 200 + 50 = 250\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n\nThe final results are: the limited slope $s_i=100\\,\\mathrm{Pa}/\\mathrm{m}$, the left interface state $p_{i,-}^{R}=150\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, and the right interface state $p_{i,+}^{L}=250\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe scalar conservation law under consideration is the inviscid Burgers equation:\n$$u_t + \\left(\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right)_x = 0$$\nThis is of the form $u_t + f(u)_x = 0$ with a flux function $f(u) = \\frac{u^2}{2}$. The initial condition is a Riemann problem:\n$$u(x,0) = \\begin{cases} u_L & \\text{if } x < 0 \\\\ u_R & \\text{if } x > 0 \\end{cases}$$\nwhere we are given the condition $u_L > u_R$.\n\nFirst, we derive the self-similar shock solution. For a Riemann problem, the solution is expected to be self-similar, i.e., $u(x,t) = v(\\xi)$ where $\\xi = x/t$. Given the piecewise constant initial data, a possible weak solution is a discontinuous jump propagating with a constant speed $s$. This solution takes the form:\n$$u(x,t) = \\begin{cases} u_L & \\text{if } x < st \\\\ u_R & \\text{if } x > st \\end{cases}$$\nThe speed of this discontinuity, $s$, is determined by the Rankine–Hugoniot jump condition, which is derived from the integral form of the conservation law. The condition states that the shock speed is the ratio of the jump in flux to the jump in the conserved variable:\n$$s = \\frac{[f(u)]}{[u]} = \\frac{f(u_R) - f(u_L)}{u_R - u_L}$$\nSubstituting the flux $f(u) = u^2/2$:\n$$s = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}u_R^2 - \\frac{1}{2}u_L^2}{u_R - u_L} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(u_R - u_L)(u_R + u_L)}{u_R - u_L} = \\frac{u_L + u_R}{2}$$\nThus, the shock-wave solution is fully described by the piecewise constant function above with the shock speed $s = \\frac{u_L + u_R}{2}$.\n\nNext, we must verify that this shock solution is physically admissible. For conservation laws with a convex flux function, the Lax admissibility criterion must be satisfied. The characteristic speed is given by $f'(u)$. For the Burgers equation, $f'(u) = u$. The flux is convex since $f''(u) = 1 > 0$. The Lax criterion for a shock connecting a left state $u_L$ to a right state $u_R$ requires that the characteristic speed of the state ahead of the shock be less than the shock speed, which in turn must be less than the characteristic speed of the state behind the shock. Mathematically:\n$$f'(u_L) > s > f'(u_R)$$\nThis condition ensures that characteristics on both sides of the shock front are directed into the shock, preventing the solution from becoming multi-valued. Substituting our derived values:\n$$u_L > \\frac{u_L + u_R}{2} > u_R$$\nThe left inequality, $u_L > \\frac{u_L+u_R}{2}$, simplifies to $2u_L > u_L + u_R$, which gives $u_L > u_R$. This is true by the problem statement. The right inequality, $\\frac{u_L+u_R}{2} > u_R$, simplifies to $u_L + u_R > 2u_R$, which also gives $u_L > u_R$. Since the condition $u_L > u_R$ is given, the Lax admissibility criterion is satisfied, and this shock is the correct entropy-satisfying solution.\n\nNow, we verify the entropy inequality. An entropy pair $(\\eta(u), q(u))$ for the conservation law consists of a convex function $\\eta(u)$ (the entropy) and a corresponding entropy flux $q(u)$ satisfying $q'(u) = \\eta'(u)f'(u)$. A standard choice for the Burgers equation is the \"mechanical energy\" entropy $\\eta(u) = \\frac{u^2}{2}$. This function is convex as $\\eta''(u) = 1 > 0$. We find its corresponding entropy flux:\n$$q'(u) = \\eta'(u)f'(u) = (u)(u) = u^2$$\nIntegrating with respect to $u$ gives $q(u) = \\frac{u^3}{3}$ (the constant of integration is irrelevant as it cancels in the jump calculation).\nFor a discontinuous solution, the entropy condition in integral form implies the entropy inequality across the shock:\n$$s[\\eta] - [q] \\ge 0$$\nwhere $[\\cdot]$ denotes the jump $[\\phi] = \\phi_R - \\phi_L$. Let us compute this quantity, which represents the rate of entropy production at the shock.\nThe jumps are:\n$$[\\eta] = \\eta(u_R) - \\eta(u_L) = \\frac{u_R^2}{2} - \\frac{u_L^2}{2}$$\n$$[q] = q(u_R) - q(u_L) = \\frac{u_R^3}{3} - \\frac{u_L^3}{3}$$\nSubstituting these and the shock speed $s = \\frac{u_L + u_R}{2}$ into the entropy production expression:\n$$s[\\eta] - [q] = \\left(\\frac{u_L + u_R}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{u_R^2 - u_L^2}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{u_R^3 - u_L^3}{3}\\right)$$\nWe can rewrite this expression to simplify it. Factoring $(u_R - u_L)$ from the first term and $(u_R^3 - u_L^3)$ gives:\n$$s[\\eta] - [q] = \\frac{(u_L + u_R)}{2} \\frac{(u_R - u_L)(u_R + u_L)}{2} - \\frac{(u_R - u_L)(u_R^2 + u_R u_L + u_L^2)}{3}$$\n$$ = -\\frac{(u_L + u_R)^2(u_L - u_R)}{4} + \\frac{(u_L - u_R)(u_L^2 + u_L u_R + u_R^2)}{3}$$\nFactoring out the term $(u_L - u_R)$:\n$$ = (u_L - u_R)\\left[-\\frac{(u_L + u_R)^2}{4} + \\frac{u_L^2 + u_L u_R + u_R^2}{3}\\right]$$\n$$ = (u_L - u_R)\\left[\\frac{-3(u_L^2 + 2u_L u_R + u_R^2) + 4(u_L^2 + u_L u_R + u_R^2)}{12}\\right]$$\n$$ = (u_L - u_R)\\left[\\frac{-3u_L^2 - 6u_L u_R - 3u_R^2 + 4u_L^2 + 4u_L u_R + 4u_R^2}{12}\\right]$$\n$$ = (u_L - u_R)\\left[\\frac{u_L^2 - 2u_L u_R + u_R^2}{12}\\right]$$\n$$ = (u_L - u_R)\\frac{(u_L - u_R)^2}{12} = \\frac{(u_L - u_R)^3}{12}$$\nSince we are given $u_L > u_R$, the term $(u_L - u_R)$ is positive, and thus $(u_L - u_R)^3 > 0$. This confirms that $s[\\eta] - [q] > 0$ for $u_L \\ne u_R$, satisfying the strict entropy inequality. This nonzero value represents the dissipation of \"energy\" (entropy) at the shock front.\n\nFinally, we discuss why a centered expansion fan is not a valid solution for $u_L > u_R$. A centered expansion fan is a continuous, self-similar solution of the form:\n$$u(x,t) = \\begin{cases} u_L & \\text{if } x/t \\le u_L \\\\ x/t & \\text{if } u_L < x/t < u_R \\\\ u_R & \\text{if } x/t \\ge u_R \\end{cases}$$\nThis structure, which continuously connects $u_L$ and $u_R$ through the fan $u = x/t$, is only valid if the interval $[u_L, u_R]$ is non-empty, which requires $u_L \\le u_R$. In our case, we have $u_L > u_R$. The condition for an expansion wave is that the characteristics must be fanning out from the origin. The characteristic speed is $f'(u)=u$. An expansion requires $f'(u_L) < f'(u_R)$, which means $u_L < u_R$.\nWhen $u_L > u_R$ as given, the characteristics are \"fanning in\" or compressing. Characteristics starting at $x < 0$ have speed $u_L$, and those starting at $x > 0$ have speed $u_R$. Since $u_L > u_R$, the characteristics will inevitably intersect for $t > 0$, leading to a multi-valued, non-physical solution. The formation of a shock wave is the physical mechanism that resolves this crossing of characteristics. An expansion fan would imply that characteristics emerge from a single point in spacetime, which is physically inadmissible and violates the fundamental principle underlying the entropy condition. Thus, the expansion fan fails conceptually and violates the entropy condition for $u_L > u_R$.\n\nThe final answer is the derived expression for the entropy production measure, $s[\\eta] - [q]$.\n$$s[\\eta] - [q] = \\frac{(u_L - u_R)^3}{12}$$",
