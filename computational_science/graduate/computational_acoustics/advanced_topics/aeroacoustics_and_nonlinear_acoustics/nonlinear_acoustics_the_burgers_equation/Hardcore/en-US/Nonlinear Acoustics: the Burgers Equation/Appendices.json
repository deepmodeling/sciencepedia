            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, self-contained, and consistent. The problem is a standard one in the study of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations and presents a clear, solvable task.\n\nThe one-dimensional inviscid Burgers equation is given by\n$$\nu_{t} + u\\,u_{x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $u=u(x,t)$ is the particle velocity. This is a first-order quasilinear partial differential equation (PDE). We solve it subject to the initial condition\n$$\nu(x,0) = u_{0}(x) = U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x)\n$$\nwith $U_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ and $k0$. We employ the method of characteristics.\n\nThe characteristic curves $x(s)$, $t(s)$, $u(s)$ are governed by the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{dt}{ds} = 1, \\quad \\frac{dx}{ds} = u, \\quad \\frac{du}{ds} = 0\n$$\nwhere $s$ is a parameter along the characteristic.\n\nIntegrating the first ODE, $\\frac{dt}{ds} = 1$, and setting the integration constant such that $s=0$ at $t=0$, we obtain $t=s$.\n\nIntegrating the third ODE, $\\frac{du}{ds} = 0$, we find that $u$ is constant along any given characteristic curve. Let this constant value be denoted by $u_{c}$. The value of $u_{c}$ for a specific characteristic is determined by the initial condition at the point $x_0$ from which the characteristic originates at $t=0$. Thus,\n$$\nu_{c} = u(x_0, 0) = U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0)\n$$\n\nIntegrating the second ODE, $\\frac{dx}{ds} = u$, and recalling that $u=u_c$ is constant along the characteristic and $s=t$, we get\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = u_{c}\n$$\nIntegration yields the equation for the characteristic line in the $(x,t)$-plane:\n$$\nx(t) = u_{c} t + x_0\n$$\nwhere $x_0$ is the position of the characteristic at $t=0$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $u_c$, we obtain the implicit solution for $u(x,t)$. The solution is defined by the pair of equations:\n\\begin{align}\nu(x,t) = U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0) \\label{eq:1} \\\\\nx = \\left(U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0)\\right)t + x_0 \\label{eq:2}\n\\end{align}\nHere, $x_0$ is treated as a parameter that labels the characteristic curves. For any given $(x,t)$, one would in principle solve the second equation for $x_0$ and substitute it into the first to find $u(x,t)$.\n\nA discontinuity, or shock, forms when the solution's gradient, $u_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$, becomes infinite. This occurs when characteristics intersect. To find the time of this \"gradient blow-up,\" we compute $u_x$ by implicit differentiation. We treat $x_0$ as a function of $x$ and $t$, i.e., $x_0(x,t)$. Differentiating equations \\eqref{eq:1} and \\eqref{eq:2} with respect to $x$ while holding $t$ constant gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_0}\\left(U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0)\\right) \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} = \\left(U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)\\right) \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\left(U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0)\\right)t + x_0\\right)\n$$\n$$\n1 = \\left(U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)\\,t\\right)\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} = \\left(1 + U_{0}\\,k\\,t\\,\\cos(k x_0)\\right)\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSolving for $\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{1 + U_{0}\\,k\\,t\\,\\cos(k x_0)}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $u_x$:\n$$\nu_x(x,t) = \\frac{U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)}{1 + U_{0}\\,k\\,t\\,\\cos(k x_0)}\n$$\nThe gradient $u_x$ becomes infinite when the denominator is zero:\n$$\n1 + U_{0}\\,k\\,t\\,\\cos(k x_0) = 0\n$$\nSolving for the time $t$ along a characteristic originating from $x_0$:\n$$\nt(x_0) = -\\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)}\n$$\nThe shock time, $t_s$, is the earliest positive time $t  0$ at which this condition is met for some $x_0$. For $t$ to be positive, the product $U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)$ must be negative. To find the minimum positive $t$, we must maximize the magnitude of this product. The term $\\cos(k x_0)$ varies between $-1$ and $1$.\n\nCase 1: $U_{0}  0$.\nFor $t  0$, we require $\\cos(k x_0)  0$. The minimum positive time occurs when the denominator is minimized (i.e., most negative). This happens when $\\cos(k x_0)$ reaches its minimum value of $-1$.\n$$\nt_\ns = \\min_{x_0} \\left(-\\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k\\,(-1)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k}\n$$\nSince $U_00$, this is equal to $\\frac{1}{|U_0|k}$.\n\nCase 2: $U_{0}  0$.\nFor $t  0$, we require $\\cos(k x_0)  0$. The minimum positive time occurs when the denominator $U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)$ is minimized (most negative). Since $U_0 k  0$, this occurs when $\\cos(k x_0)$ reaches its maximum value of $1$.\n$$\nt_\ns = \\min_{x_0} \\left(-\\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k\\,(1)}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k}\n$$\nSince $U_00$, we can write $U_0 = -|U_0|$, so $t_s = -\\frac{1}{-|U_0|k} = \\frac{1}{|U_0|k}$.\n\nIn both cases, the earliest time of shock formation is identical and is given by:\n$$\nt_s = \\frac{1}{|U_0|k}\n$$\nThis is the time of wave breaking, or gradient blow-up, expressed in terms of the given parameters $U_0$ and $k$.\n\nNow, we relate this result to the maximum initial slope, $S_{\\max}$. The initial slope is given by the derivative of the initial condition:\n$$\nu_x(x,0) = \\frac{d}{dx} u_0(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x)\\right) = U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x)\n$$\nThe maximum initial slope, $S_{\\max}$, is the maximum absolute value of this quantity over all $x$:\n$$\nS_{\\max} = \\max_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}\\,|u_x(x,0)| = \\max_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}\\, |U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x)|\n$$\nSince $| \\cos(k x)| \\le 1$ and $k0$, the maximum value is attained when $|\\cos(k x)|=1$.\n$$\nS_{\\max} = |U_{0}\\,k| = |U_0|k\n$$\nComparing our expression for $t_s$ with $S_{\\max}$, we find the physical relationship:\n$$\nt_s = \\frac{1}{|U_0|k} = \\frac{1}{S_{\\max}}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the shock formation time is the reciprocal of the maximum magnitude of the initial velocity gradient. Alternatively, the shock time is the reciprocal of the maximum compressive slope, as it occurs at points where $u_x(x,0)0$ and has the largest magnitude, specifically $u_x(x,0) = -|U_0|k$. The time to shock is $t_s = -1/\\min(u_x(x,0)) = -1/(-|U_0|k) = 1/(|U_0|k)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final result as a single closed-form analytic expression for $t_s$ in terms of $U_0$ and $k$.",

The finite-difference equation becomes:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - a \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}(u_{j+1}^n - u_j^n) + \\frac{\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}(u_{j+1}^n - 2u_j^n + u_{j-1}^n)\n$$\nGrouping terms:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = \\left(-\\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\right)u_{j+1}^n + \\left(1 + \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} - \\frac{2\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\right)u_j^n + \\left(\\frac{\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\right)u_{j-1}^n\n$$\nApplying the non-negativity condition for the coefficients, and letting $|a| = -a$ since $a  0$:\n1.  Coefficient of $u_{j-1}^n$: $\\frac{\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\ge 0$. True.\n2.  Coefficient of $u_{j+1}^n$: $\\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\ge 0$. True.\n3.  Coefficient of $u_j^n$: $1 + \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} - \\frac{2\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} = 1 - \\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} - \\frac{2\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\ge 0$. This is the constraint.\n\nBoth cases yield the same form of the stability constraint, expressed in terms of $|a|$:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} - \\frac{2\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\ge 0\n$$\nRearranging this inequality to solve for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n1 \\ge \\Delta t \\left( \\frac{|a|}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{2\\nu}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{\\frac{|a|}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{2\\nu}{(\\Delta x)^2}}\n$$\nTo obtain a sufficient stability condition for the original nonlinear Burgers equation, this inequality must hold for all values of the local speed $u(x,t)$. Given the prescribed bound $|u(x,t)| \\le U_{\\max}$, the most restrictive (smallest $\\Delta t$) condition is found by substituting the maximum possible speed, $|a| \\to U_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{\\frac{U_{\\max}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{2\\nu}{(\\Delta x)^2}}\n$$\nThis is the desired sufficient Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) stability condition. The right-hand side of this inequality defines the maximum permissible time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$.\n\nThe algorithm to be implemented is as follows:\n1.  For a given set of parameters $(\\nu, \\Delta x, U_{\\max}, \\Delta t)$, calculate the maximum stable time step $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ using the derived formula:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{U_{\\max}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{2\\nu}{(\\Delta x)^2}}\n    $$\n2.  Determine if the proposed time step $\\Delta t$ is stable by checking if the condition $\\Delta t \\le \\Delta t_{\\max}$ is satisfied.\n3.  The output for each case will be the pair $[\\Delta t_{\\max}, \\text{is\\_stable}]$, where $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ is rounded to $9$ decimal places and `is_stable` is a boolean value.",
