            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, self-contained, and consistent. The problem is a standard one in the study of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations and presents a clear, solvable task.\n\nThe one-dimensional inviscid Burgers equation is given by\n$$\nu_{t} + u\\,u_{x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $u=u(x,t)$ is the particle velocity. This is a first-order quasilinear partial differential equation (PDE). We solve it subject to the initial condition\n$$\nu(x,0) = u_{0}(x) = U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x)\n$$\nwith $U_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ and $k0$. We employ the method of characteristics.\n\nThe characteristic curves $x(s)$, $t(s)$, $u(s)$ are governed by the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{dt}{ds} = 1, \\quad \\frac{dx}{ds} = u, \\quad \\frac{du}{ds} = 0\n$$\nwhere $s$ is a parameter along the characteristic.\n\nIntegrating the first ODE, $\\frac{dt}{ds} = 1$, and setting the integration constant such that $s=0$ at $t=0$, we obtain $t=s$.\n\nIntegrating the third ODE, $\\frac{du}{ds} = 0$, we find that $u$ is constant along any given characteristic curve. Let this constant value be denoted by $u_{c}$. The value of $u_{c}$ for a specific characteristic is determined by the initial condition at the point $x_0$ from which the characteristic originates at $t=0$. Thus,\n$$\nu_{c} = u(x_0, 0) = U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0)\n$$\n\nIntegrating the second ODE, $\\frac{dx}{ds} = u$, and recalling that $u=u_c$ is constant along the characteristic and $s=t$, we get\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = u_{c}\n$$\nIntegration yields the equation for the characteristic line in the $(x,t)$-plane:\n$$\nx(t) = u_{c} t + x_0\n$$\nwhere $x_0$ is the position of the characteristic at $t=0$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $u_c$, we obtain the implicit solution for $u(x,t)$. The solution is defined by the pair of equations:\n\\begin{align}\nu(x,t) = U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0) \\label{eq:1} \\\\\nx = \\left(U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0)\\right)t + x_0 \\label{eq:2}\n\\end{align}\nHere, $x_0$ is treated as a parameter that labels the characteristic curves. For any given $(x,t)$, one would in principle solve the second equation for $x_0$ and substitute it into the first to find $u(x,t)$.\n\nA discontinuity, or shock, forms when the solution's gradient, $u_x = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}$, becomes infinite. This occurs when characteristics intersect. To find the time of this \"gradient blow-up,\" we compute $u_x$ by implicit differentiation. We treat $x_0$ as a function of $x$ and $t$, i.e., $x_0(x,t)$. Differentiating equations \\eqref{eq:1} and \\eqref{eq:2} with respect to $x$ while holding $t$ constant gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_0}\\left(U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0)\\right) \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} = \\left(U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)\\right) \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}\n$$\nand\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\left(U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x_0)\\right)t + x_0\\right)\n$$\n$$\n1 = \\left(U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)\\,t\\right)\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} = \\left(1 + U_{0}\\,k\\,t\\,\\cos(k x_0)\\right)\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSolving for $\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{1 + U_{0}\\,k\\,t\\,\\cos(k x_0)}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $u_x$:\n$$\nu_x(x,t) = \\frac{U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)}{1 + U_{0}\\,k\\,t\\,\\cos(k x_0)}\n$$\nThe gradient $u_x$ becomes infinite when the denominator is zero:\n$$\n1 + U_{0}\\,k\\,t\\,\\cos(k x_0) = 0\n$$\nSolving for the time $t$ along a characteristic originating from $x_0$:\n$$\nt(x_0) = -\\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)}\n$$\nThe shock time, $t_s$, is the earliest positive time $t  0$ at which this condition is met for some $x_0$. For $t$ to be positive, the product $U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)$ must be negative. To find the minimum positive $t$, we must maximize the magnitude of this product. The term $\\cos(k x_0)$ varies between $-1$ and $1$.\n\nCase 1: $U_{0}  0$.\nFor $t  0$, we require $\\cos(k x_0)  0$. The minimum positive time occurs when the denominator is minimized (i.e., most negative). This happens when $\\cos(k x_0)$ reaches its minimum value of $-1$.\n$$\nt_s = \\min_{x_0} \\left(-\\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k\\,(-1)}\\right) = \\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k}\n$$\nSince $U_00$, this is equal to $\\frac{1}{|U_0|k}$.\n\nCase 2: $U_{0}  0$.\nFor $t  0$, we require $\\cos(k x_0)  0$. The minimum positive time occurs when the denominator $U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x_0)$ is minimized (most negative). Since $U_0 k  0$, this occurs when $\\cos(k x_0)$ reaches its maximum value of $1$.\n$$\nt_s = \\min_{x_0} \\left(-\\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k\\,(1)}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{U_{0}\\,k}\n$$\nSince $U_00$, we can write $U_0 = -|U_0|$, so $t_s = -\\frac{1}{-|U_0|k} = \\frac{1}{|U_0|k}$.\n\nIn both cases, the earliest time of shock formation is identical and is given by:\n$$\nt_s = \\frac{1}{|U_0|k}\n$$\nThis is the time of wave breaking, or gradient blow-up, expressed in terms of the given parameters $U_0$ and $k$.\n\nNow, we relate this result to the maximum initial slope, $S_{\\max}$. The initial slope is given by the derivative of the initial condition:\n$$\nu_x(x,0) = \\frac{d}{dx} u_0(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(U_{0}\\,\\sin(k x)\\right) = U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x)\n$$\nThe maximum initial slope, $S_{\\max}$, is the maximum absolute value of this quantity over all $x$:\n$$\nS_{\\max} = \\max_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}\\,|u_x(x,0)| = \\max_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}\\, |U_{0}\\,k\\,\\cos(k x)|\n$$\nSince $| \\cos(k x)| \\le 1$ and $k0$, the maximum value is attained when $|\\cos(k x)|=1$.\n$$\nS_{\\max} = |U_{0}\\,k| = |U_0|k\n$$\nComparing our expression for $t_s$ with $S_{\\max}$, we find the physical relationship:\n$$\nt_s = \\frac{1}{|U_0|k} = \\frac{1}{S_{\\max}}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the shock formation time is the reciprocal of the maximum magnitude of the initial velocity gradient. Alternatively, the shock time is the reciprocal of the maximum compressive slope, as it occurs at points where $u_x(x,0)0$ and has the largest magnitude, specifically $u_x(x,0) = -|U_0|k$. The time to shock is $t_s = -1/\\min(u_x(x,0)) = -1/(-|U_0|k) = 1/(|U_0|k)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the final result as a single closed-form analytic expression for $t_s$ in terms of $U_0$ and $k$.",

Express your final answer as a single analytic expression. No numerical evaluation or rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and computational acoustics, well-posed with a unique entropy solution, and stated objectively. All necessary information is provided.\n\nThe problem concerns the one-dimensional inviscid Burgers' equation, a model for a conservation law:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u + \\partial_{x} f(u) = 0\n$$\nwhere the flux function is $f(u) = \\frac{u^{2}}{2}$. Expanding the spatial derivative gives the quasi-linear form:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u + f'(u) \\partial_{x} u = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\partial_{t} u + u \\partial_{x} u = 0\n$$\nThis equation states that the quantity $u$ is constant along characteristic curves defined by the ordinary differential equation $\\frac{dx}{dt} = u$. Since $u$ is constant along each characteristic, the characteristics are straight lines in the $x-t$ plane with equation $x = x_0 + u(x_0, 0) t$, where $x_0$ is the initial position at $t=0$.\n\nThe initial data is a Riemann problem:\n$$\nu(x,0) = \n\\begin{cases}\nu_{L},  x  0, \\\\\nu_{R},  x  0,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$ are constants.\n\nWe analyze the two cases for the relationship between $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$.\n\nCase 1: $u_{L}  u_{R}$ (Rarefaction Wave)\nFor initial positions $x_0  0$, the initial value is $u(x_0, 0) = u_{L}$. The characteristics are a family of parallel lines $x = x_0 + u_{L} t$.\nFor initial positions $x_0  0$, the initial value is $u(x_0, 0) = u_{R}$. The characteristics are a family of parallel lines $x = x_0 + u_{R} t$.\n\nSince $u_{L}  u_{R}$, the speed of the characteristics originating from the left half-axis is less than the speed of those from the right half-axis. This means the characteristics diverge from the origin $x=0$, creating a void or a fan-like region where the solution is not determined by simply propagating the initial data. This region is bounded by the slowest characteristic from the right ($x_0 \\to 0^+$, speed $u_{R}$) and the fastest from the left ($x_0 \\to 0^-$, speed $u_{L}$). The fan is the region $u_{L}t \\le x \\le u_{R}t$.\n\nTo find the solution within this fan, we seek a self-similar solution of the form $u(x,t) = g(\\frac{x}{t})$. Substituting this into the quasi-linear equation $\\partial_{t} u + u \\partial_{x} u = 0$ gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{x}{t^2} g'(\\frac{x}{t}) + g(\\frac{x}{t}) \\frac{1}{t} g'(\\frac{x}{t}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t^2} g'(\\frac{x}{t}) \\left(tg(\\frac{x}{t}) - x\\right) = 0\n$$\nThis is satisfied if $g'(\\frac{x}{t})=0$ (constant solution) or if $g(\\frac{x}{t}) = \\frac{x}{t}$. The latter provides the non-trivial continuous connection between $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$.\nThus, the entropy solution is a continuous rarefaction wave:\n$$\nu(x,t) = \n\\begin{cases}\nu_{L},  \\text{if } x/t  u_{L} \\\\\nx/t,  \\text{if } u_{L} \\le x/t \\le u_{R} \\\\\nu_{R},  \\text{if } x/t  u_{R}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $u_{L}  u_{R}$ (Shock Wave)\nIn this case, the characteristic speed $u_L$ from the left is greater than the speed $u_R$ from the right. Characteristics originating from $x0$ will cross those originating from $x0$. This leads to a multi-valued, unphysical solution. The physical resolution is the formation of a discontinuity, or a shock wave, that propagates from the origin.\n\nTo determine the speed of this shock, we use the integral form of the conservation law. This is known as the Rankine–Hugoniot jump condition. We begin with the conservation law in integral form over a fixed spatial domain $[a,b]$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{a}^{b} u(x,t) \\, dx = f(u(a,t)) - f(u(b,t))\n$$\nLet the shock be a single discontinuity moving with speed $s$, located at position $x=s(t)$. Let the domain $[a,b]$ be chosen such that it contains the shock, with $a  s(t)  b$. The solution is piecewise constant: $u(x,t) = u_{L}$ for $x  s(t)$ and $u(x,t) = u_{R}$ for $x  s(t)$. The values $u(a,t)$ and $u(b,t)$ are therefore $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$ respectively, so $f(u(a,t)) = f(u_{L})$ and $f(u(b,t)) = f(u_{R})$. The integral form becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{a}^{b} u(x,t) \\, dx = f(u_{L}) - f(u_{R})\n$$\nWe can evaluate the integral on the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\int_{a}^{b} u(x,t) \\, dx = \\int_{a}^{s(t)} u_{L} \\, dx + \\int_{s(t)}^{b} u_{R} \\, dx = u_{L}(s(t)-a) + u_{R}(b-s(t))\n$$\nNow, we differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$. The shock speed is $s = \\frac{ds(t)}{dt}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ u_{L}(s(t)-a) + u_{R}(b-s(t)) \\right] = u_{L} \\frac{ds(t)}{dt} - u_{R} \\frac{ds(t)}{dt} = (u_{L} - u_{R})s\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the time derivative yields the Rankine–Hugoniot condition:\n$$\n(u_{L} - u_{R})s = f(u_{L}) - f(u_{R})\n$$\nSolving for the shock speed $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{f(u_{L}) - f(u_{R})}{u_{L} - u_{R}}\n$$\nThis condition ensures that the discontinuous solution is a valid weak solution to the original conservation law. For the Burgers' equation, the flux function is $f(u) = \\frac{u^2}{2}$. We substitute this into the expression for $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\frac{u_{L}^{2}}{2} - \\frac{u_{R}^{2}}{2}}{u_{L} - u_{R}}\n$$\nFactoring the numerator as a difference of squares:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(u_{L} - u_{R})(u_{L} + u_{R})}{u_{L} - u_{R}}\n$$\nSince we are in the shock case, $u_{L}  u_{R}$, which means $u_{L} - u_{R} \\neq 0$. We can cancel this term from the numerator and denominator, yielding the analytical expression for the shock speed:\n$$\ns = \\frac{u_{L} + u_{R}}{2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression. This specific shock solution is the unique entropy solution because it satisfies the Lax entropy condition for a convex flux: the characteristic speed on the left ($u_{L}$) must be greater than the characteristic speed on the right ($u_{R}$), which is precisely the condition $u_{L}  u_{R}$.",
