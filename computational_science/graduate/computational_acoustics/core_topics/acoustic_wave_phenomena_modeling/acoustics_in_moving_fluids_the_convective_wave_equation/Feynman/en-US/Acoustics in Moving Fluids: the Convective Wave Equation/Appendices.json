The $\\pm$ accounts for the two acoustic wave modes.\n\nFor the second part, we must find the convection-induced anisotropy factor $\\Gamma(\\theta,\\kappa)$. It is defined as the ratio of the discrete convective projection $k_x^{\\text{eff}}$ to its continuous counterpart $k_x$. The continuous projection is $k_x = k \\cos\\theta$.\nThe discrete projection $k_x^{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective wavenumber corresponding to the spatial derivative operator $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. The problem specifies a centered difference for the first derivative in space (as part of the mixed derivative): $(\\delta_x p)^{n}_{j,l} = (p^{n}_{j+1,l} - p^{n}_{j-1,l})/(2h)$.\nApplying this operator to the spatial part of the plane wave, $\\exp(i k_x j h)$:\n$$\n\\delta_x[\\exp(i k_x j h)] = \\frac{\\exp(i k_x (j+1) h) - \\exp(i k_x (j-1) h)}{2h} = \\frac{\\exp(i k_x h) - \\exp(-i k_x h)}{2h} \\exp(i k_x j h)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2i\\sin(k_x h)}{2h} \\exp(i k_x j h) = i \\left(\\frac{\\sin(k_x h)}{h}\\right) \\exp(i k_x j h)\n$$\nThe continuous operator $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ applied to $\\exp(i k_x x)$ yields $i k_x \\exp(i k_x x)$. By comparing the discrete and continuous results, we identify the effective wavenumber as:\n$$\nk_x^{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\sin(k_x h)}{h}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this in terms of $\\kappa \\equiv k h$ and $\\theta$. We use the relations $k_x = k\\cos\\theta$ and $\\kappa_x = k_x h$:\n$$\nk_x h = (k \\cos\\theta) h = (k h) \\cos\\theta = \\kappa \\cos\\theta\n$$\nSubstituting this, we get:\n$$\nk_x^{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\sin(\\kappa \\cos\\theta)}{h}\n$$\nThis matches the expression for $k_x^{\\text{eff}}$ provided in the problem statement.\nNow we can compute the anisotropy factor $\\Gamma(\\theta,\\kappa)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\theta,\\kappa) \\equiv \\frac{k_x^{\\text{eff}}}{k_x} = \\frac{\\sin(k_x h) / h}{k_x} = \\frac{\\sin(k_x h)}{k_x h}\n$$\nSubstituting $k_x h = \\kappa \\cos\\theta$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(\\theta,\\kappa) = \\frac{\\sin(\\kappa \\cos\\theta)}{\\kappa \\cos\\theta}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the anisotropy factor.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is a well-posed task in computational acoustics, requiring the numerical solution of the one-dimensional convected wave equation and a verification of the numerical scheme's convergence rate. The problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and all parameters and methods are clearly defined.\n\nThe solution proceeds by discretizing the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is then integrated in time. The core steps of the methodology are outlined below.\n\n### 1. System of Equations\nThe problem begins with the second-order convected wave equation for acoustic pressure perturbation $p(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 p - c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} = 0\n$$\nwhere $U$ is the uniform mean flow velocity and $c$ is the constant speed of sound.

Spatial Discretization\nThe spatial domain $[0, L]$ is discretized into $N$ uniformly spaced grid points $x_i = i \\Delta x$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = L/N$. The values of $p$ and $q$ at these points are denoted by $p_i(t) = p(x_i, t)$ and $q_i(t) = q(x_i, t)$, respectively.\n\nThe spatial derivatives are approximated using $2^{\\text{nd}}$-order centered finite differences. For a generic function $f(x)$ on the grid, the derivatives at point $x_i$ are:\n- First derivative: $\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right)_i \\approx \\frac{f_{i+1} - f_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x}$\n- Second derivative: $\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}\\right)_i \\approx \\frac{f_{i+1} - 2f_i + f_{i-1}}{\\Delta x^2}$\n\nDue to the periodic boundary conditions, the indices are handled modulo $N$, i.e., $f_{N} \\equiv f_0$ and $f_{-1} \\equiv f_{N-1}$. Applying these discretizations to the first-order system yields a large system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the grid-point values:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{d p_i}{d t} &= - U \\left(\\frac{p_{i+1} - p_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x}\\right) + q_i \\\\\n\\frac{d q_i}{d t} &= - U \\left(\\frac{q_{i+1} - q_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta x}\\right) + c^2 \\left(\\frac{p_{i+1} - 2p_i + p_{i-1}}{\\Delta x^2}\\right)\n\\end{align*}\nThis system can be written in compact vector form as $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y})$, where $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [p_0(t), \\dots, p_{N-1}(t), q_0(t), \\dots, q_{N-1}(t)]^T$ is the state vector of size $2N$, and $\\mathbf{F}$ is the function representing the discretized spatial operators on the right-hand side.\n\n### 3. Temporal Integration\nThe system of ODEs is advanced in time using the explicit $2^{\\text{nd}}$-order two-stage Runge-Kutta method, also known as Heun's method. For a time step $\\Delta t$, the state vector $\\mathbf{y}^{n+1}$ at time $t_{n+1} = t_n + \\Delta t$ is computed from $\\mathbf{y}^n$ at time $t_n$ as follows:\n1. Predictor step: $\\mathbf{y}^* = \\mathbf{y}^n + \\Delta t \\cdot \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}^n)$\n2. Corrector step: $\\mathbf{y}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}^n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left[ \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}^n) + \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y}^*) \\right]$\n\nThe time step $\\Delta t$ is chosen based on the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition for numerical stability. The maximum characteristic speed of the system is $|U| + c$. A preliminary time step is calculated as $\\Delta t_{\\text{CFL}} = \\text{CFL} \\cdot \\Delta x / (|U| + c)$ with a given CFL number of $0.2$. To ensure the simulation stops at the exact final time $T$, the number of integer time steps is calculated as $N_t = \\lceil T / \\Delta t_{\\text{CFL}} \\rceil$. The actual time step used for integration is then re-calculated as $\\Delta t = T / N_t$.\n\n### 4. Convergence Analysis\nThe numerical simulation is initialized at $t=0$ using the manufactured exact solution:\n$$\np(x,0) = \\sin(k x), \\qquad q(x,0) = -c k \\cos(k x)\n$$\nwhere the wavenumber is $k = 2\\pi m / L$ with $m=1$. After integrating to the final time $T$, the numerical solution $p_{\\text{num}}(x_i, T)$ is compared to the exact solution $p_{\\text{exact}}(x_i, T) = \\sin(k x_i - \\omega T)$, where the angular frequency is $\\omega = k(U+c)$.\n\nThe error is quantified using the discrete $L^2$ norm:\n$$\nE(\\Delta x) = \\left(\\Delta x \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\left[p_{\\text{num}}(x_i,T) - p_{\\text{exact}}(x_i,T)\\right]^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe theoretical order of accuracy for the combined spatial and temporal discretization is $p_{\\text{th}} = 2$. This implies that the error should scale as $E(\\Delta x) \\propto (\\Delta x)^{p_{\\text{th}}}$. To verify this, we run the simulation for a sequence of four grid resolutions $N=[50, 100, 200, 400]$, yielding a set of grid spacings $\\Delta x_j$ and corresponding errors $E_j$. Taking the logarithm, we get $\\log(E) \\approx \\log(C) + p_{\\text{obs}} \\log(\\Delta x)$. The observed convergence rate, $p_{\\text{obs}}$, is determined by finding the slope of a best-fit line to the points $(\\log(\\Delta x_j), \\log(E_j))$ using linear regression.\n\nFinally, the observed rate is compared to the theoretical rate. A boolean flag $b$ is set to true if the observed rate is within a tolerance of the theoretical rate, i.e., $|p_{\\text{obs}} - 2| \\le 0.15$. The procedure is repeated for each test case specified in the problem.",

Let $p'(\\mathbf{x},t)$ denote the acoustic pressure perturbation. The convective derivative is $D_t = \\partial_t + \\mathbf{U}\\cdot\\nabla$. In the physical domain, the acoustic field satisfies the convective wave equation. A sponge layer is implemented adjacent to a planar boundary normal to the $x$-direction by augmenting the pressure equation inside the sponge with a relaxation term $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) D_t p'$, where $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) \\ge 0$ is a spatially varying relaxation strength. Outside the sponge, $\\sigma(\\mathbf{x})=0$.\n\nYour task is to design a program that, for a semi-infinite sponge layer occupying $x>0$ with a uniform relaxation strength $\\sigma$ (constant in $x$), computes and tunes $\\sigma$ to minimize the reflection magnitude for incident plane waves over a specified frequency band and set of incidence angles. Assume the interface between the undamped region ($x<0$) and the sponge ($x>0$) is at $x=0$, and model the reflection at $x=0$ using a plane-wave impedance mismatch with the following physical constraints:\n\n- The undamped region satisfies the convective wave dynamics with $\\sigma=0$.\n- The sponge region satisfies the convective wave dynamics with the relaxation term $\\sigma D_t p'$ active.\n- The tangential wavenumber component (along $y$) is conserved across the interface.\n- The sponge layer is semi-infinite so that no reflection occurs from $x\\to +\\infty$; only the interface reflection at $x=0$ is relevant.\n\nStarting from first principles of linearized acoustics in moving media, the program shall use the physically admissible plane-wave solutions and interface continuity conditions to compute, for each frequency $f$ and incidence angle $\\theta$, the normal wavenumber $k_x$ in the undamped region, the corresponding tangential wavenumber $k_y$, the complex normal wavenumber in the sponge, and the resulting plane-wave normal specific acoustic impedances on both sides of the interface. The reflection coefficient at the interface is then computed as the ratio of impedance mismatch, and its magnitude is used as the reflection metric. Your program must choose $\\sigma$ to minimize the worst-case (maximum over the frequency band and angle set) reflection magnitude.\n\nUnits and conventions:\n\n- Use $c_0$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, $U$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, and $\\rho_0$ in $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.\n- Frequencies are given in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ and must be converted to angular frequency $\\omega$ in $\\mathrm{rad/s}$ using $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.\n- Angles are specified in degrees and must be interpreted in degrees.\n- The relaxation strength $\\sigma$ is in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n- The output relaxation strengths must be reported in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, rounded to six decimal places.\n\nOptimization protocol:\n\n- For each test case, sample the frequency band using $N_f=20$ equally spaced points between $f_{\\min}$ and $f_{\\max}$ (inclusive).\n- For the angle set, use the given discrete angles as-is.\n- For each candidate $\\sigma$ in a search grid $\\sigma \\in [0,5000]\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ sampled at $\\Delta\\sigma=25\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, compute the maximum reflection magnitude over all sampled frequencies and angles.

            "solution": "The present task requires the determination of an optimal relaxation strength $\\sigma$ for a semi-infinite sponge layer designed to absorb acoustic waves in a uniform mean flow. The optimization criterion is to minimize the maximum reflection coefficient magnitude over a specified range of frequencies and incidence angles. The solution involves deriving the reflection properties of the interface between the standard fluid and the sponge layer from first principles.\n\nWe begin with the governing equations. The acoustic field is described by the pressure perturbation $p'(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in a fluid with base density $\\rho_0$, sound speed $c_0$, and a uniform mean flow $\\mathbf{U} = U \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. The material derivative in the presence of the mean flow is $D_t = \\partial_t + \\mathbf{U} \\cdot \\nabla = \\partial_t + U \\partial_x$.\n\nIn the undamped region ($x<0$), the pressure field satisfies the convective wave equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{c_0^2} D_t^2 p' - \\nabla^2 p' = 0 $$\nIn the sponge region ($x>0$), the equation is augmented with a relaxation term, which, based on standard formulations for absorbing layers, modifies the convective wave equation to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{c_0^2} D_t^2 p' + \\frac{\\sigma}{c_0^2} D_t p' - \\nabla^2 p' = 0 $$\nwhere $\\sigma > 0$ is the constant relaxation strength.\n\nTo analyze reflection and transmission, we seek plane-wave solutions of the form $p'(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\hat{p} e^{i(k_x x + k_y y - \\omega t)}$. Applying the differential operators to this form yields: $\\partial_t \\to -i\\omega$, $\\nabla \\to i\\mathbf{k} = i(k_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + k_y \\hat{\\mathbf{y}})$, and $D_t \\to i(Uk_x - \\omega)$. Substituting these into the governing equations gives the dispersion relation for each region.\n\nFor the undamped region ($x<0$, denoted by subscript $1$):\n$$ -\\frac{1}{c_0^2}(\\omega - Uk_x)^2 + (k_x^2 + k_y^2) = 0 $$\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation for $k_x$:\n$$ (c_0^2 - U^2)k_x^2 + (2\\omega U)k_x + (c_0^2 k_y^2 - \\omega^2) = 0 $$\n\nFor the sponge region ($x>0$, denoted by subscript $2$):\n$$ -\\frac{1}{c_0^2}(\\omega - Uk_x)^2 + i\\frac{\\sigma}{c_0^2}(\\omega - Uk_x) + (k_x^2 + k_y^2) = 0 $$\nThis also yields a quadratic equation for the complex wavenumber $k_{x,s}$ in the sponge:\n$$ (c_0^2 - U^2)k_{x,s}^2 + (2\\omega U - i\\sigma U)k_{x,s} + (c_0^2 k_y^2 - \\omega^2 + i\\sigma\\omega) = 0 $$\n\nAn incident plane wave is characterized by its frequency $f$ (angular frequency $\\omega=2\\pi f$) and incidence angle $\\theta$ relative to the $x$-axis. The wave vector $\\mathbf{k}_{\\text{inc}}$ makes an angle $\\theta$ with the $x$-axis. Its magnitude $k = |\\mathbf{k}_{\\text{inc}}|$ is related to $\\omega$ via the dispersion relation: $(\\omega - U k \\cos\\theta)^2 = (c_0 k)^2$. For a forward-propagating wave in a subsonic flow, we take the positive root, leading to $\\omega - U k \\cos\\theta = c_0 k$, which gives $k = \\omega / (c_0 + U\\cos\\theta)$. The components of the incident wave vector are:\n$$ k_{x,\\text{inc}} = \\frac{\\omega \\cos\\theta}{c_0 + U\\cos\\theta}, \\quad k_y = \\frac{\\omega \\sin\\theta}{c_0 + U\\cos\\theta} $$\nThe tangential wavenumber $k_y$ must be continuous across the interface at $x=0$.\nIn the undamped region, for a given $(\\omega, k_y)$, there are two solutions for $k_x$: the incident $k_{x,\\text{inc}}$ and the reflected $k_{x,\\text{refl}}$. From Vieta's formulas applied to the quadratic for $k_x$, their sum is $k_{x,\\text{inc}} + k_{x,\\text{refl}} = -2\\omega U / (c_0^2 - U^2)$. Thus,\n$$ k_{x,\\text{refl}} = -\\frac{2\\omega U}{c_0^2 - U^2} - k_{x,\\text{inc}} $$\n\nIn the sponge region, we solve the complex quadratic equation for $k_{x,s}$. Let the equation be $A k_{x,s}^2 + B k_{x,s} + C = 0$. The solutions are $k_{x,s} = (-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2-4AC})/(2A)$. Since the sponge is semi-infinite, the wave must decay as $x \\to \\infty$. This physical constraint requires that the imaginary part of $k_{x,s}$ be positive, i.e., $\\text{Im}(k_{x,s}) > 0$. We select the root that satisfies this condition.\n\nThe reflection coefficient is determined by the impedance mismatch. The normal specific acoustic impedance for a single plane wave is derived from the linearized momentum equation in the $x$-direction, $\\rho_0 D_t u'_x = -\\partial_x p'$:\n$$ Z(k_x) = \\frac{\\hat{p}}{\\hat{u}_x} = \\frac{\\rho_0(\\omega - Uk_x)}{k_x} $$\nAt the interface, the total fields must be continuous. The impedance of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves are $Z_i = Z(k_{x,\\text{inc}})$, $Z_r = Z(k_{x,\\text{refl}})$, and $Z_2 = Z(k_{x,s})$, respectively.\nThe pressure reflection coefficient $R = \\hat{p}_{\\text{refl}} / \\hat{p}_{\\text{inc}}$ is found by enforcing continuity of pressure and normal particle velocity at the interface, which yields a relation between the impedances:\n$$ R = \\frac{Z_r(Z_i - Z_2)}{Z_i(Z_2 - Z_r)} $$\nThe reflection coefficient magnitude $|R|$ is computed for each pair of frequency and angle.\n\nThe optimization procedure involves a grid search over the specified range of $\\sigma$. For each candidate $\\sigma$, we compute the maximum value of $|R|$ across all sampled frequencies and angles. The optimal $\\sigma$ is the one that minimizes this maximum $|R|$. If a tie occurs, the smallest $\\sigma$ is chosen.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, set up the grids for frequency $f_j$ and relaxation strength $\\sigma_k$.\n2.  Initialize $\\sigma_{\\text{opt}} = 0$ and a minimum-of-maximums reflection $R_{\\min-\\max} = \\infty$.\n3.  Loop over each $\\sigma_k$:\n4.  Initialize a maximum reflection for the current sigma, $R_{\\max}(\\sigma_k) = 0$.\n5.  Loop over each frequency $f_j$ and angle $\\theta_l$:\n    a. Calculate $\\omega=2\\pi f_j$ and convert $\\theta_l$ to radians.\n    b. Compute $k_{x,\\text{inc}}$ and $k_y$.\n    c. Compute $k_{x,\\text{refl}}$.\n    d. Solve the complex quadratic dispersion relation for the sponge to find $k_{x,s}$ with $\\text{Im}(k_{x,s})>0$.\n    e. Calculate the impedances $Z_i$, $Z_r$, and $Z_2$. Special care is taken for cases where a wavenumber component is near zero, although the derived formulas are well-behaved.\n    f. Compute the reflection coefficient magnitude $|R|$.\n    g. Update $R_{\\max}(\\sigma_k) = \\max(R_{\\max}(\\sigma_k), |R|)$.\n6.  If $R_{\\max}(\\sigma_k) < R_{\\min-\\max}$, update $R_{\\min-\\max} = R_{\\max}(\\sigma_k)$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{opt}} = \\sigma_k$.\n7.  The final $\\sigma_{\\text{opt}}$ for the test case is the result. This procedure is repeated for all test cases.",
