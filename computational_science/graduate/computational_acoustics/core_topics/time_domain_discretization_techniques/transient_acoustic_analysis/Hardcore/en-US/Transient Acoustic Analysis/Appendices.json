            "problem": "A linearized small-amplitude acoustic model is considered in one spatial dimension for a benchmark Riemann problem and in three spatial dimensions for a benchmark free-space outgoing pulse. The one-dimensional model (valid for small perturbations about a quiescent state) is governed by the linearized continuity and momentum equations, which for pressure $p(x,t)$ and particle velocity $u(x,t)$ read $p_t + \\rho_0 c^2 u_x = 0$ and $u_t + \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} p_x = 0$, where $\\rho_0$ is the constant reference density and $c$ is the sound speed. The three-dimensional model for the pressure field $p(\\mathbf{x},t)$ is governed by the homogeneous acoustic wave equation $p_{tt} - c^2 \\Delta p = 0$ in free space.\n\nBenchmark 1 (one-dimensional Riemann problem): Take an initial discontinuity at $x=0$ with $p(x,0) = p_0 H(x)$ and $u(x,0) = 0$, where $H(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. Let $\\rho_0 = 1.2$ (reference density in kilograms per cubic meter), $c = 343$ (sound speed in meters per second), and $p_0 = 1.0$ (pressure amplitude in pascals). A probe is placed at $x = -L$ with $L = 0.5$ (meters). The numerical scheme under validation should reproduce the correct wave speeds, arrival times, and wave amplitudes, and should honor appropriate energy properties of the linearized system.\n\nBenchmark 2 (three-dimensional free-space outgoing pulse): Consider a spherically symmetric, purely outgoing pulse generated by specifying initial data $p(\\mathbf{x},0) = 0$ and $p_t(\\mathbf{x},0) = g(|\\mathbf{x}|)$ with $g$ compactly supported and radially symmetric so that the resulting solution is an outgoing spherical wave. Place two probes at radii $R_1 = 0.5$ and $R_2 = 1.0$ (meters) along any ray from the origin. The numerical solution under validation should exhibit the correct geometric spreading, arrival times of the pulse peak, and physically appropriate conservation properties associated with the acoustic wave equation.\n\nWhich option best specifies physically correct and precise validation criteria for these benchmarks, including arrival times, amplitudes, and norm-based checks?\n\nA. For Benchmark 1, the pressure and velocity split into left- and right-traveling waves with speeds $\\pm c$. At the probe $x = -L$, the first nonzero arrival occurs at time $t^* = L/c \\approx 0.001458$ (seconds). Immediately after arrival, $p(-L,t^*+) = p_0/2 = 0.5$ and $u(-L,t^*+) = -\\dfrac{p_0}{2 \\rho_0 c} \\approx -0.00121$ (meters per second), with the negative sign indicating motion to the left. A robust validation must include the discrete acoustic energy check in one dimension, using the energy density $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 u^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\dfrac{p^2}{\\rho_0 c^2}$, and report relative energy drift over time. For Benchmark 2, the outgoing spherical wave exhibits amplitude decay proportional to $1/r$ and the pulse peak at radius $R$ arrives at $t_R = R/c$, so $t_{R_1} \\approx 0.001458$ and $t_{R_2} \\approx 0.002915$ (seconds). The peak-amplitude ratio satisfies $p_{\\max}(R_2)/p_{\\max}(R_1) = R_1/R_2 = 0.5$, and an appropriate validation includes comparison of the measured $L^\\infty$ amplitudes to the $1/r$ law together with an energy-flux consistency check over spheres.\n\nB. For Benchmark 1, the arrival at $x = -L$ is $t^* = 2L/c \\approx 0.002915$ (seconds), and the full jump $p(-L,t^*+) = p_0 = 1.0$ is observed with $u(-L,t^*+) = +\\dfrac{p_0}{\\rho_0 c}$ (meters per second). Validation is based on conservation of the $L^2$ norm of $p$ over space. For Benchmark 2, the amplitude decays as $1/r^2$, the peak arrival times are $t_{R_1} = R_1/c$ and $t_{R_2} = R_2/c$, and $p_{\\max}(R_2)/p_{\\max}(R_1) = (R_1/R_2)^2 = 0.25$.\n\nC. For Benchmark 1, choose the probe at $x = +L$ and expect the first arrival at $t^* = L/c \\approx 0.001458$ (seconds) with $p(+L,t^*+) = p_0/2 = 0.5$ and $u(+L,t^*+) = +\\dfrac{p_0}{2 \\rho_0 c}$ (meters per second). Validation uses the $L^2$ norm of $p$ and requires that it be invariant to within numerical tolerance. For Benchmark 2, the amplitude at radius $R$ is independent of $R$, so $p_{\\max}(R_2)/p_{\\max}(R_1) = 1$, and the peak arrives at $t_R = R/c$.\n\nD. For Benchmark 1, wave speeds depend on the local wavenumber of the initial jump, so the arrival time at $x = -L$ satisfies $t^* > L/c$ due to dispersion, and the plateau value after arrival is $p_0$ with $u = 0$. For Benchmark 2, the spherical pulse exhibits diffusive spreading, so the amplitude decays faster than $1/r^2$, the peak arrival at radius $R$ is later than $R/c$, and validation should therefore focus on matching a frequency-dependent group velocity less than $c$ and dissipative decay in the $L^2$ norm.",

I will proceed with deriving the solution and evaluating the options.\n\n**Derivation of Analytical Solution**\n\n**Benchmark 1: 1D Riemann Problem**\nThe system of equations $p_t + \\rho_0 c^2 u_x = 0$ and $u_t + \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} p_x = 0$ is a standard hyperbolic system whose solutions propagate at characteristic speeds $\\lambda = \\pm c$. The general solution can be expressed as a superposition of a right-traveling wave $f(x-ct)$ and a left-traveling wave $g(x+ct)$.\nFor the state vector $(p, u)$, the solution is:\n$$ p(x,t) = f(x-ct) + g(x+ct) $$\n$$ u(x,t) = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 c} f(x-ct) - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 c} g(x+ct) $$\nThe initial conditions are $p(x,0) = p_0 H(x)$ and $u(x,0) = 0$.\nAt $t=0$:\n$p(x,0) = f(x) + g(x) = p_0 H(x)$\n$u(x,0) = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 c} [f(x) - g(x)] = 0 \\implies f(x) = g(x)$\nSubstituting $f(x) = g(x)$ into the first equation gives $2f(x) = p_0 H(x)$, so $f(x) = g(x) = \\frac{p_0}{2}H(x)$.\nThe full solution is therefore:\n$$ p(x,t) = \\frac{p_0}{2} H(x-ct) + \\frac{p_0}{2} H(x+ct) $$\n$$ u(x,t) = \\frac{p_0}{2\\rho_0 c} H(x-ct) - \\frac{p_0}{2\\rho_0 c} H(x+ct) $$\nThis shows the initial jump at $x=0$ splits into two waves of half the amplitude, propagating in opposite directions.\nA probe is at $x = -L = -0.5$ m. This probe will only be affected by the left-traveling wave, described by the term with argument $x+ct$. The wave front reaches $x=-L$ at a time $t^*$ such that $-L + ct^* = 0$, which gives $t^* = L/c$.\nUsing the given values, $L=0.5$ m and $c=343$ m/s, the arrival time is:\n$$ t^* = \\frac{0.5}{343} \\approx 0.0014577 \\text{ s} \\approx 0.001458 \\text{ s} $$\nFor $t > t^*$, the state at the probe $x = -L$ is determined. At this location, $x-ct = -L-ct < 0$ for all $t>0$, so $H(x-ct)=0$. The argument $x+ct = -L+ct > 0$, so $H(x+ct)=1$.\nThe pressure and velocity at the probe for $t > t^*$ are:\n$$ p(-L, t>t^*) = \\frac{p_0}{2}(0) + \\frac{p_0}{2}(1) = \\frac{p_0}{2} = \\frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5 \\text{ Pa} $$\n$$ u(-L, t>t^*) = \\frac{p_0}{2\\rho_0 c}(0) - \\frac{p_0}{2\\rho_0 c}(1) = -\\frac{p_0}{2\\rho_0 c} = -\\frac{1.0}{2(1.2)(343)} \\approx -0.0012147 \\text{ m/s} \\approx -0.00121 \\text{ m/s} $$\nThe negative velocity indicates particle motion in the $-x$ direction (leftward), consistent with the wave propagation direction.\nFor this non-dissipative system, the total acoustic energy, whose density is $E_d = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 u^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{p^2}{\\rho_0 c^2}$, is a conserved quantity. Verifying the conservation of its discrete analogue is a standard and crucial test for numerical schemes.\n\n**Benchmark 2: 3D Free-Space Outgoing Pulse**\nThe 3D wave equation $p_{tt} - c^2 \\Delta p = 0$ for a radially symmetric pressure $p(r,t)$ can be simplified by the substitution $q(r,t) = r p(r,t)$, which yields the 1D wave equation $q_{tt} - c^2 q_{rr} = 0$.\nThe general solution for $p(r,t)$ is $p(r,t) = \\frac{f(r-ct)}{r} + \\frac{g(r+ct)}{r}$.\nThe problem specifies a \"purely outgoing pulse,\" which corresponds to the solution $p(r,t) = \\frac{f(r-ct)}{r}$. This functional form shows that the amplitude of the wave shape $f$ decays as $1/r$. This phenomenon is known as geometric spreading.\nThe peak amplitude of the pressure pulse at a radius $R$, denoted $p_{\\max}(R)$, is proportional to $1/R$. The ratio of peak amplitudes at two radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ is:\n$$ \\frac{p_{\\max}(R_2)}{p_{\\max}(R_1)} = \\frac{k/R_2}{k/R_1} = \\frac{R_1}{R_2} $$\nWith $R_1 = 0.5$ m and $R_2 = 1.0$ m, this ratio is $0.5/1.0 = 0.5$.\nThe wave shape propagates outwards at speed $c$. Therefore, the peak of the pulse, which is at some position in the argument of $f$, arrives at radius $R$ at time $t_R = R/c$ (relative to its \"emission\" time from the origin).\nThe arrival times at the probes are:\n$$ t_{R_1} = \\frac{R_1}{c} = \\frac{0.5}{343} \\approx 0.001458 \\text{ s} $$\n$$ t_{R_2} = \\frac{R_2}{c} = \\frac{1.0}{343} \\approx 0.002915 \\text{ s} $$\nFor a 3D outgoing spherical wave, the total acoustic power flowing through any sphere of radius $r$ enclosing the source is constant. The acoustic intensity (power per unit area) is $I_r \\propto p^2$. The total power is $P = I_r \\times (\\text{Area}) = I_r \\times (4\\pi r^2)$. Since $p \\propto 1/r$, then $I_r \\propto p^2 \\propto 1/r^2$. Thus, $P \\propto (1/r^2) \\times (4\\pi r^2)$, which is independent of $r$. Verifying that the numerically computed energy flux is consistent across spheres of different radii is a robust validation check.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. For Benchmark 1, the pressure and velocity split into left- and right-traveling waves with speeds $\\pm c$. At the probe $x = -L$, the first nonzero arrival occurs at time $t^* = L/c \\approx 0.001458$ (seconds). Immediately after arrival, $p(-L,t^*+) = p_0/2 = 0.5$ and $u(-L,t^*+) = -\\dfrac{p_0}{2 \\rho_0 c} \\approx -0.00121$ (meters per second), with the negative sign indicating motion to the left. A robust validation must include the discrete acoustic energy check in one dimension, using the energy density $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 u^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\dfrac{p^2}{\\rho_0 c^2}$, and report relative energy drift over time. For Benchmark 2, the outgoing spherical wave exhibits amplitude decay proportional to $1/r$ and the pulse peak at radius $R$ arrives at $t_R = R/c$, so $t_{R_1} \\approx 0.001458$ and $t_{R_2} \\approx 0.002915$ (seconds). The peak-amplitude ratio satisfies $p_{\\max}(R_2)/p_{\\max}(R_1) = R_1/R_2 = 0.5$, and an appropriate validation includes comparison of the measured $L^\\infty$ amplitudes to the $1/r$ law together with an energy-flux consistency check over spheres.**\n- This option's description for Benchmark 1 is entirely consistent with the analytical solution derived above: wave splitting, speeds, arrival time, and post-arrival values for $p$ and $u$ are all correct. The proposed energy conservation check is the physically correct one.\n- The description for Benchmark 2 is also fully correct: $1/r$ amplitude decay, peak arrival times, peak amplitude ratio, and the proposed validation checks ($L^\\infty$ norm decay and energy flux) are all appropriate and accurate.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For Benchmark 1, the arrival at $x = -L$ is $t^* = 2L/c \\approx 0.002915$ (seconds), and the full jump $p(-L,t^*+) = p_0 = 1.0$ is observed with $u(-L,t^*+) = +\\dfrac{p_0}{\\rho_0 c}$ (meters per second). Validation is based on conservation of the $L^2$ norm of $p$ over space. For Benchmark 2, the amplitude decays as $1/r^2$, the peak arrival times are $t_{R_1} = R_1/c$ and $t_{R_2} = R_2/c$, and $p_{\\max}(R_2)/p_{\\max}(R_1) = (R_1/R_2)^2 = 0.25$.**\n- Benchmark 1: The arrival time is incorrect ($L/c$, not $2L/c$). The pressure jump is incorrect ($p_0/2$, not $p_0$). The velocity is incorrect in both magnitude and sign. The $L^2$ norm of $p$ is not a conserved quantity for this system.\n- Benchmark 2: The amplitude decay law is incorrect (it is $1/r$, not $1/r^2$). The peak amplitude ratio is consequently incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For Benchmark 1, choose the probe at $x = +L$ and expect the first arrival at $t^* = L/c \\approx 0.001458$ (seconds) with $p(+L,t^*+) = p_0/2 = 0.5$ and $u(+L,t^*+) = +\\dfrac{p_0}{2 \\rho_0 c}$ (meters per second). Validation uses the $L^2$ norm of $p$ and requires that it be invariant to within numerical tolerance. For Benchmark 2, the amplitude at radius $R$ is independent of $R$, so $p_{\\max}(R_2)/p_{\\max}(R_1) = 1$, and the peak arrives at $t_R = R/c$.**\n- Benchmark 1: This option modifies the problem by moving the probe to $x=+L$. While the physics described for this new location is mostly correct, the proposed validation metric (conservation of $L^2$ norm of $p$) is incorrect.\n- Benchmark 2: The statement that amplitude is independent of $R$ is incorrect; this would describe a plane wave, not a spherical wave, and would violate energy conservation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. For Benchmark 1, wave speeds depend on the local wavenumber of the initial jump, so the arrival time at $x = -L$ satisfies $t^* > L/c$ due to dispersion, and the plateau value after arrival is $p_0$ with $u = 0$. For Benchmark 2, the spherical pulse exhibits diffusive spreading, so the amplitude decays faster than $1/r^2$, the peak arrival at radius $R$ is later than $R/c$, and validation should therefore focus on matching a frequency-dependent group velocity less than $c$ and dissipative decay in the $L^2$ norm.**\n- Benchmark 1: This is incorrect. The specified model equations are non-dispersive; all frequencies travel at speed $c$. The arrival time is exactly $L/c$. The post-arrival state is also incorrect.\n- Benchmark 2: This is incorrect. The wave equation is hyperbolic, not parabolic, so it exhibits propagation, not diffusion. The phenomena described (diffusive spreading, arrival later than $R/c$, dissipation) are characteristic of different physical models (e.g., viscous or heat-conducting fluids).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that provides a physically and mathematically correct set of validation criteria for both benchmarks.",

A more consistent centering would be:\n$$ \\frac{p_i^{n+1} - p_i^n}{\\Delta t} = -K \\frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1/2} - u_{i-1}^{n+1/2}}{2 \\Delta x} $$\n$$ \\frac{u_i^{n+1/2} - u_i^{n-1/2}}{\\Delta t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{p_{i+1}^n - p_{i-1}^n}{2 \\Delta x} $$\nRearranging these gives the explicit update equations for the solver:\n1. Update for velocity $u$:\n$$ u_i^{n+1/2} = u_i^{n-1/2} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho (2 \\Delta x)} (p_{i+1}^n - p_{i-1}^n) $$\n2. Update for pressure $p$:\n$$ p_i^{n+1} = p_i^n - K \\frac{\\Delta t}{2 \\Delta x} (u_{i+1}^{n+1/2} - u_{i-1}^{n+1/2}) $$\nThis scheme is second-order accurate in both time and space, $O(\\Delta t^2, \\Delta x^2)$.\n\n**3. Scheme Initialization**\n\nThe simulation starts at $t=0$ with given initial conditions $p(x,0)$ and $u(x,0)$. We set $p_i^0 = \\sin(2\\pi x_i)$ and $u_i^0 = 0$. The leapfrog scheme requires $u$ at a half-time step to begin. To find $u_i^{1/2}$, we perform a single forward Euler half-step update for $u$ from $t=0$ to $t=\\Delta t/2$:\n$$ u_i^{1/2} = u_i^0 - \\frac{\\Delta t/2}{\\rho} \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)_i^0 \\approx u_i^0 - \\frac{\\Delta t/2}{\\rho} \\frac{p_{i+1}^0 - p_{i-1}^0}{2\\Delta x} $$\nSince $u_i^0=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ u_i^{1/2} = - \\frac{\\Delta t}{4 \\rho \\Delta x} (p_{i+1}^0 - p_{i-1}^0) $$\nThis \"kick-start\" step has a local truncation error of $O(\\Delta t^2)$, which is consistent with the global second-order accuracy of the main leapfrog algorithm and does not degrade the overall convergence rate.\n\n**4. Boundary Conditions**\n\nPeriodic boundary conditions, $f(0,t) = f(L,t)$, are implemented by ensuring that for a grid point $i$, the neighbor at $i-1$ for $i=0$ is $N_x-1$, and the neighbor at $i+1$ for $i=N_x-1$ is $0$. In the vector-based implementation, this is efficiently handled using `numpy.roll` to perform circular shifts on the arrays representing the fields $p$ and $u$.\n\n**5. Error Analysis and Empirical Order of Convergence (EOC)**\n\nThe numerical solution is run until a final time $T_{final}$. The final time is determined by $T_{final} = N_t \\Delta t$, where $N_t = \\lceil T/\\Delta t \\rceil$ to ensure the simulation time is at least the target time $T$. The accuracy of the numerical pressure $p_i(T_{final})$ is measured against the exact solution $p_{\\text{exact}}(x_i, T_{final})$ using the discrete $L^2$-norm:\n$$ E = \\left( \\Delta x \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x-1} \\left[p_i(T_{final}) - p_{\\text{exact}}(x_i, T_{final})\\right]^2 \\right)^{1/2} $$\nThe Empirical Order of Convergence (EOC) is computed from two runs with characteristic step sizes $h_1$ and $h_2$ (where $h$ can be $\\Delta t$ or $\\Delta x$) and corresponding errors $E_1$ and $E_2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{EOC} = \\frac{\\log(E_1/E_2)}{\\log(h_1/h_2)} $$\nFor refinements where $h_2=h_1/2$, this simplifies to $\\mathrm{EOC} = \\log_2(E_1/E_2)$.\n\n**6. Convergence Study Design**\n\nThe four test cases are designed to validate the theoretical second-order convergence of the scheme in both time and space.\n- **Time Refinement (Cases 1 & 2)**: The spatial resolution $N_x$ is held constant while the time step $\\Delta t$ is systematically refined. The error is expected to be dominated by the temporal discretization, and the EOC with respect to $\\Delta t$ should be approximately $2$. Case $1$ uses a fine spatial grid and small Courant numbers, representing an ideal scenario. Case $2$ probes behavior near the stability limit (Courant number $\\approx 1$).\n- **Space Refinement (Cases 3 & 4)**: The spatial resolution $N_x$ is refined, and the time step $\\Delta t$ is coupled to the spatial step via $\\Delta t = \\sigma \\Delta x^2 / c$. The total error is of the form $O(\\Delta t^2, \\Delta x^2) = O((\\Delta x^2)^2, \\Delta x^2) = O(\\Delta x^4, \\Delta x^2)$. As $\\Delta x$ decreases, the $O(\\Delta x^2)$ term dominates. This design effectively isolates the spatial convergence rate, which is expected to be approximately $2$. Case $3$ uses relatively fine grids, while Case $4$ uses coarse grids where pre-asymptotic effects might reduce the observed EOC.",

            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional linearized acoustic wave equation for pressure, derived from the linearized momentum and continuity equations under small perturbations in a homogeneous medium of constant density and sound speed, given by $p_{tt} - c^{2} p_{xx} = 0$, where $p(x,t)$ is pressure, $c$ is the sound speed, and subscripts denote partial derivatives. In computational acoustics, high-frequency spurious transients can arise from numerical dispersion and aliasing when discretizing this equation on a grid. A common stabilization is to add an artificial viscosity term $\\nu\\, p_{xxt}$ to the right-hand side, yielding $p_{tt} - c^{2} p_{xx} = \\nu\\, p_{xxt}$, where $\\nu$ is a positive coefficient with dimensions of $\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Alternatively, explicit filtering in Fourier space attenuates high-wavenumber components per time step. Both approaches aim to suppress spurious high-frequency content while minimally disturbing the physical frequency band of interest.\n\nStarting from first principles of the wave dynamics and modal (Fourier) analysis, explain the mechanism by which high-wavenumber modes are selectively damped by artificial viscosity or filtering. Then, derive a criterion that ensures the relative amplitude attenuation at time $T$ across the physical band of interest is bounded below by a specified threshold, while the spurious band is attenuated below a specified level. Concretely, let the physical band be defined by wavenumbers $|k| \\leq k_{p}$, where $k_{p} = 2\\pi f_{p}/c$ for a maximum physical frequency $f_{p}$, and let the spurious band be characterized by $|k| \\geq k_{s}$, where $k_{s}$ can be approximated by the numerical Nyquist wavenumber $k_{s} = \\pi/\\Delta x$ on a uniform grid of spacing $\\Delta x$. Let the acceptable relative amplitude loss (after time $T$) for the physical band be no more than $\\varepsilon$ (so amplitudes must remain at least $1 - \\varepsilon$ of their initial values), and the required attenuation factor for the spurious band be at most $r$ (so amplitudes must be reduced to $r$ or less of their initial values).\n\nFor the following scientifically realistic parameters, compute the minimal artificial viscosity coefficient $\\nu$ that satisfies both constraints at time $T$:\n- Sound speed $c = 1500\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- Grid spacing $\\Delta x = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}$,\n- Maximum physical frequency $f_{p} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$,\n- Time horizon $T = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{s}$,\n- Physical-band tolerance $\\varepsilon = 0.010$,\n- Spurious-band attenuation target $r = 0.600$.\n\nExpress the final $\\nu$ in $\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and round your answer to four significant figures. Your derivation should start from the governing equations and use modal analysis to obtain the wavenumber-dependent attenuation, from which you formulate the criterion linking $\\nu$, $k_{p}$, $k_{s}$, $\\varepsilon$, $r$, and $T$, and then compute the required value for $\\nu$ under the given parameters.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an explanation of the selective damping mechanism of artificial viscosity in the context of the one-dimensional acoustic wave equation and a derivation of the minimal viscosity coefficient $\\nu$ that satisfies specific attenuation criteria for physical and spurious frequency bands.\n\nFirst, I shall validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Governing Equation with Artificial Viscosity**: $p_{tt} - c^{2} p_{xx} = \\nu\\, p_{xxt}$, where $p(x,t)$ is pressure, $c$ is sound speed, and $\\nu$ is the artificial viscosity coefficient.\n- **Physical Band Wavenumber**: $|k| \\leq k_{p}$, with $k_{p} = \\frac{2\\pi f_{p}}{c}$.\n- **Spurious Band Wavenumber**: $|k| \\geq k_{s}$, with $k_{s} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta x}$.\n- **Physical Band Constraint**: Relative amplitude loss is no more than $\\varepsilon$, meaning the final amplitude at time $T$ must be at least $1 - \\varepsilon$ times the initial amplitude.\n- **Spurious Band Constraint**: Attenuation factor is at most $r$, meaning the final amplitude at time $T$ must be no more than $r$ times the initial amplitude.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - Sound speed: $c = 1500\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n  - Grid spacing: $\\Delta x = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n  - Maximum physical frequency: $f_{p} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n  - Time horizon: $T = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n  - Physical-band tolerance: $\\varepsilon = 0.010$\n  - Spurious-band attenuation target: $r = 0.600$\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically sound. The linearized acoustic wave equation is a fundamental model. The addition of a $p_{xxt}$ term is a standard and well-understood method for introducing artificial viscosity to stabilize numerical schemes for hyperbolic partial differential equations. The analysis via Fourier modes is the correct and standard approach to study the dispersive and dissipative properties of such an equation.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides two inequality constraints on a single parameter, $\\nu$, and asks for the minimum value that satisfies them. This is a well-defined optimization problem. All necessary data are provided.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent set of data and constraints. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe governing equation is the one-dimensional acoustic wave equation modified with an artificial viscosity term:\n$$p_{tt} - c^{2} p_{xx} = \\nu p_{xxt}$$\nTo analyze the behavior of different frequency components, we perform a modal analysis. We seek a plane-wave solution of the form:\n$$p(x,t) = \\hat{p}(k) \\exp(i(kx - \\omega t))$$\nwhere $k$ is the real-valued wavenumber and $\\omega$ is the potentially complex-valued angular frequency. The imaginary part of $\\omega$ will describe the temporal amplitude decay or growth.\n\nWe compute the partial derivatives of this solution form:\n- $p_{tt} = (-i\\omega)^{2} p = -\\omega^{2} p$\n- $p_{xx} = (ik)^{2} p = -k^{2} p$\n- $p_{xxt} = (ik)^{2}(-i\\omega) p = i\\omega k^{2} p$\n\nSubstituting these into the governing equation yields the characteristic equation, also known as the dispersion relation:\n$$-\\omega^{2} p - c^{2}(-k^{2} p) = \\nu (i\\omega k^{2} p)$$\nDividing by $p$ (which is non-zero for a non-trivial solution), we get:\n$$-\\omega^{2} + c^{2} k^{2} = i\\nu\\omega k^{2}$$\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation for $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega^{2} + (i\\nu k^{2})\\omega - c^{2} k^{2} = 0$$\nWe solve for $\\omega$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\\omega = \\frac{-i\\nu k^{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(i\\nu k^{2})^{2} - 4(1)(-c^{2} k^{2})}}{2} = \\frac{-i\\nu k^{2} \\pm \\sqrt{-\\nu^{2} k^{4} + 4c^{2} k^{2}}}{2}$$\n$$\\omega = \\frac{-i\\nu k^{2} \\pm |k|\\sqrt{4c^{2} - \\nu^{2} k^{2}}}{2}$$\nWe can separate $\\omega$ into its real and imaginary parts, $\\omega = \\omega_{R} + i\\omega_{I}$.\n$$\\omega_{R} = \\pm \\frac{|k|}{2}\\sqrt{4c^{2} - \\nu^{2} k^{2}}$$\n$$\\omega_{I} = -\\frac{\\nu k^{2}}{2}$$\nThe solution for a given mode $k$ is $p_k(x,t) = \\hat{p}(k) \\exp(i(kx - \\omega_R t)) \\exp(\\omega_I t)$. The amplitude of this mode evolves in time as $A(t) = A(0) \\exp(\\omega_I t) = A(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu k^{2}}{2} t\\right)$.\n\n**Mechanism of Selective Damping:**\nThe damping is governed by the term $\\exp(-\\frac{\\nu k^{2}}{2} t)$. Since $\\nu  0$, the amplitude of every mode decreases over time. The crucial observation is that the decay rate, given by the exponent $-\\frac{\\nu k^{2} t}{2}$, is proportional to $k^{2}$. This means that modes with high wavenumbers (large $|k|$), which correspond to high spatial frequencies and often arise as spurious numerical artifacts, are damped much more aggressively than modes with low wavenumbers (small $|k|$), which represent the physical, large-scale features of the wave. This is the mechanism by which artificial viscosity selectively suppresses high-frequency numerical noise.\n\n**Derivation of the Criterion for $\\nu$:**\nThe relative amplitude of a mode with wavenumber $k$ after a time $T$ is:\n$$A_{rel}(k, T) = \\frac{A(T)}{A(0)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu k^{2} T}{2}\\right)$$\n\n**Constraint 1: Physical Band ($|k| \\leq k_{p}$)**\nThe amplitude loss must not exceed $\\varepsilon$, so the relative amplitude must be at least $1-\\varepsilon$. The damping is strongest at the upper edge of this band, $|k|=k_{p}$. To satisfy the constraint for the entire band, we must satisfy it at this worst-case point:\n$$A_{rel}(k_p, T) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu k_{p}^{2} T}{2}\\right) \\geq 1 - \\varepsilon$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{\\nu k_{p}^{2} T}{2} \\geq \\ln(1 - \\varepsilon)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\\frac{\\nu k_{p}^{2} T}{2} \\leq -\\ln(1 - \\varepsilon) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon}\\right)$$\nThis gives an upper bound on $\\nu$:\n$$\\nu \\leq \\frac{2}{k_{p}^{2} T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon}\\right)$$\n\n**Constraint 2: Spurious Band ($|k| \\geq k_{s}$)**\nThe amplitude must be attenuated to at most a factor of $r$. Damping is weakest at the lower edge of this band, $|k|=k_{s}$. To ensure all spurious modes are sufficiently attenuated, we must satisfy the constraint at this least-damped point:\n$$A_{rel}(k_s, T) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\nu k_{s}^{2} T}{2}\\right) \\leq r$$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$-\\frac{\\nu k_{s}^{2} T}{2} \\leq \\ln(r)$$\n$$\\frac{\\nu k_{s}^{2} T}{2} \\geq -\\ln(r) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$$\nThis gives a lower bound on $\\nu$:\n$$\\nu \\geq \\frac{2}{k_{s}^{2} T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$$\n\n**Computation of Minimal $\\nu$:**\nWe require a value of $\\nu$ that satisfies both derived inequalities. To find the minimal such $\\nu$, we must choose the smallest possible value that satisfies the second constraint, which is the lower bound itself. This choice is valid if it does not violate the first constraint.\nThe minimal viscosity coefficient is therefore:\n$$\\nu_{min} = \\frac{2}{k_{s}^{2} T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical parameters.\nFirst, calculate the wavenumbers $k_{p}$ and $k_{s}$:\n$$k_{p} = \\frac{2\\pi f_{p}}{c} = \\frac{2\\pi (1000)}{1500} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n$$k_{s} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\pi}{0.1} = 10\\pi\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, compute $\\nu_{min}$ using $k_{s} = 10\\pi$, $T = 0.020$, and $r = 0.600$:\n$$\\nu_{min} = \\frac{2}{(10\\pi)^{2} (0.020)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.600}\\right) = \\frac{2}{100\\pi^{2} (0.020)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\pi^{2}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)$$\nNumerically:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) \\approx 0.51082562376$$\n$$\\pi^{2} \\approx 9.8696044011$$\n$$\\nu_{min} \\approx \\frac{0.51082562}{9.8696044} \\approx 0.05175743\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nWe must verify that this minimal $\\nu$ also satisfies the physical band constraint:\n$\\nu \\leq \\frac{2}{k_{p}^{2} T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\varepsilon}\\right)$. Let's calculate this upper bound, $\\nu_{max}$:\n$$\\nu_{max} = \\frac{2}{\\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\right)^{2} (0.020)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - 0.010}\\right) = \\frac{2}{\\frac{16\\pi^{2}}{9} (0.020)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.99}\\right) = \\frac{18}{0.32\\pi^{2}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.99}\\right)$$\nNumerically:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.99}\\right) \\approx 0.01005033585$$\n$$\\nu_{max} \\approx \\frac{18}{0.32\\pi^{2}} (0.01005033) \\approx \\frac{0.180906}{3.15827} \\approx 0.057280\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nSince $\\nu_{min} \\approx 0.051757$ is indeed less than $\\nu_{max} \\approx 0.057280$, a valid range for $\\nu$ exists, and the minimal value is $\\nu_{min}$.\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\\nu \\approx 0.05176\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nWriting this in standard scientific notation gives $5.176 \\times 10^{-2}$.",
