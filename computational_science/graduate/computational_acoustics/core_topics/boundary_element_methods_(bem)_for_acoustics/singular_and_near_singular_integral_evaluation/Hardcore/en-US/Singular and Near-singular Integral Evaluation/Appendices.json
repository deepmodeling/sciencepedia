In our local coordinates, this is the distance from the origin to the point $(\\xi_1, \\xi_2, h(\\xi_1, \\xi_2))$.\n    $$\n    r = \\sqrt{\\xi_1^2 + \\xi_2^2 + h(\\xi_1, \\xi_2)^2} = \\sqrt{\\rho^2 + O(\\rho^4)} = \\rho \\sqrt{1 + O(\\rho^2)} = \\rho \\left(1 + O(\\rho^2)\\right)\n    $$\n    For small $\\rho$, the leading-order term is simply $r \\approx \\rho$.\n\n2.  **The surface element $d\\Gamma_{\\mathbf{y}}$**: The differential surface element is given by\n    $$\n    d\\Gamma_{\\mathbf{y}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial \\xi_1}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial \\xi_2}\\right)^2} \\, d\\xi_1 d\\xi_2\n    $$\n    Since $\\nabla h = O(\\rho)$, we have $(\\nabla h)^2 = O(\\rho^2)$.

In local coordinates, this condition is $r  \\epsilon$, which becomes $\\rho(1+O(\\rho^2))  \\epsilon$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, this domain on the surface is asymptotically equivalent to the open disk $D_{\\epsilon} = \\{(\\xi_1, \\xi_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid \\rho  \\epsilon\\}$ in the tangent plane.\n\nSubstituting these leading-order approximations into the integral $I(\\epsilon)$, we obtain:\n$$\nI(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_{D_{\\epsilon}} \\frac{\\exp(i k \\rho)}{4\\pi \\rho} \\, d\\xi_1 d\\xi_2\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral over the disk $D_{\\epsilon}$, we switch to polar coordinates $(\\rho, \\theta)$ in the $(\\xi_1, \\xi_2)$-plane.

Since the exponential function is continuous, $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\exp(i k \\epsilon) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} I(\\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{\\exp(i k \\epsilon) - 1}{2ik} = \\frac{1 - 1}{2ik} = 0\n$$\nThe leading-order behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$ can be found by a Taylor expansion of the exponential term for small $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\exp(i k \\epsilon) = 1 + i k \\epsilon + O((k\\epsilon)^2)\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$$\nI(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{(1 + i k \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)) - 1}{2ik} = \\frac{i k \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)}{2ik} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} + O(\\epsilon^2)\n$$\nThis confirms that $I(\\epsilon) \\to 0$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\n\nThe singularity of the kernel $G(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})$ is of order $|\\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{y}|^{-1}$. In a surface integral setting in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the surface measure $d\\Gamma_{\\mathbf{y}}$ behaves locally like $\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$. The integrand thus behaves like $\\rho^{-1} \\cdot \\rho$, which is regular. Since the integral over any arbitrarily small neighborhood containing the singularity exists and is finite, the singularity is classified as **weak**.\n\nThe final answer is the value of the limit.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the evaluation of the Cauchy Principal Value (PV) of a singular integral for the double-layer kernel in potential theory, under the specific condition that the integration surface is planar and the density function is constant.\n\nThe integral to be computed is\n$$\nI(\\mathbf{x}) = \\operatorname{PV} \\int_{\\Gamma} \\frac{\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x})}{|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}|^{3}} \\, f(\\mathbf{y}) \\, \\mathrm{d}S_{\\mathbf{y}}\n$$\nwhere the density is given as $f(\\mathbf{y}) = 1$.\n\nFirst, we state the definition of the Principal Value integral. Let $\\mathbf{x}$ be a point in the interior of the surface $\\Gamma$. The PV is defined as the limit of an integral over the surface from which a small neighborhood of the singularity $\\mathbf{x}$ has been excluded. For a planar surface patch, this neighborhood is a disk. Let $D_\\epsilon(\\mathbf{x})$ denote a disk of radius $\\epsilon  0$ centered at $\\mathbf{x}$ and lying within the plane of $\\Gamma$.

The problem statement provides the following crucial geometric constraints:\n1.  The surface patch $\\Gamma$ is planar, meaning it is a subset of a plane $\\Pi \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n2.  This plane $\\Pi$ is defined by the equation $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{z} = c$ for a fixed unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ and a constant $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means that for any point $\\mathbf{z}$ on the plane $\\Pi$, its dot product with the normal $\\mathbf{n}$ is the constant $c$.\n3.  The integration point, $\\mathbf{y}$, traverses the surface $\\Gamma$. Since $\\Gamma \\subset \\Pi$, it follows that for any $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\Gamma$, the relation $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} = c$ must hold.\n4.  The observation point, $\\mathbf{x}$, is located in the interior of $\\Gamma$. This implies that $\\mathbf{x}$ is also a point on the surface patch, and therefore $\\mathbf{x}$ must also lie in the plane $\\Pi$. Consequently, the relation $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} = c$ must also hold.\n\nUsing these facts, we can directly evaluate the dot product in the numerator of the integrand. By the linearity of the dot product, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}\n$$\nSubstituting the values derived from the definition of the plane $\\Pi$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}) = c - c = 0\n$$\nThis result holds for any point $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\Gamma$ and the given point $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\Gamma$. The vector $\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}$ is a vector that lies entirely within the plane $\\Pi$, and the vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is, by definition, normal (orthogonal) to this plane. Thus, their dot product is necessarily zero.\n\nNow we can analyze the integrand. The integrand is\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x})}{|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}|^{3}} = \\frac{0}{|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}|^{3}}\n$$\nThis expression is evaluated for points $\\mathbf{y}$ in the domain $\\Gamma \\setminus D_\\epsilon(\\mathbf{x})$. In this domain, $\\mathbf{y} \\neq \\mathbf{x}$, which ensures that the denominator $|\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}|^{3}$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the integrand is identically zero for all $\\mathbf{y}$ in the integration domain.\n\nThe integral for any fixed $\\epsilon  0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Gamma \\setminus D_\\epsilon(\\mathbf{x})} 0 \\, \\mathrm{d}S_{\\mathbf{y}} = 0\n$$\nThe final step is to evaluate the limit as $\\epsilon$ approaches zero, as required by the PV definition:\n$$\nI(\\mathbf{x}) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\left( \\int_{\\Gamma \\setminus D_\\epsilon(\\mathbf{x})} 0 \\, \\mathrm{d}S_{\\mathbf{y}} \\right) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} 0 = 0\n$$\nThe value of the integral is $0$. This result is a direct and unavoidable consequence of the specified planar geometry. It is worth noting that no symmetry arguments regarding the shape of the domain $\\Gamma$ were necessary, as the integrand vanishes pointwise due to the orthogonality of the normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ and the difference vector $\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}$.\n\nThis result is consistent with the solid angle interpretation of the double-layer kernel. The expression (up to a factor of $-1/(4\\pi)$) represents the solid angle subtended by the surface element $\\mathrm{d}S_{\\mathbf{y}}$ at the observation point $\\mathbf{x}$. Since the point $\\mathbf{x}$ lies in the same plane as the surface $\\Gamma$, the surface subtends a solid angle of zero at $\\mathbf{x}$. The calculation confirms this physical intuition with mathematical rigor.",

The resulting integrand is smooth and bounded, making it suitable for standard numerical quadrature. We employ Gauss-Legendre quadrature for high accuracy.\n\n    *   **Global Part**: This consists of two integrals, over $[-1, s_{\\mathrm{lo}}]$ and $[s_{\\mathrm{hi}}, 1]$. On these intervals, the distance $|s-\\xi|$ is always greater than or equal to the local patch half-width $\\varepsilon$ (unless the patch is truncated by the element boundary, in which case $|s-\\xi|$ is still bounded away from $0$). Therefore, the integrand $\\phi(s)K(s;\\xi,d)$ is smooth, and these integrals are also evaluated using Gauss-Legendre quadrature.\n\n3.  **Numerical Implementation**: The algorithm is implemented in a Python function. Standard Gauss-Legendre quadrature is realized using `numpy.polynomial.legendre.leggauss` to obtain nodes and weights. The logic correctly handles the special cases $d=0$ and truncated local patches (when $\\xi$ is close to $\\pm 1$). The final result for each test case is the sum of the three computed parts.",
