            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its language. We proceed with the solution, which consists of three parts: the derivation of the Kolmogorov scales, their numerical computation, and a physical interpretation in the context of turbulent combustion.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the smallest turbulent length and time scales based on dimensional analysis. According to the Kolmogorov hypotheses, in the viscous dissipation range of turbulence, the relevant physical quantities are the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the mean rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation per unit mass, $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe dimensions of these quantities are:\n- Kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$: $[L^2 T^{-1}]$\n- Dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$: $[L^2 T^{-3}]$. Note that energy per unit mass has dimensions of velocity squared, $([L T^{-1}])^2 = [L^2 T^{-2}]$, and a rate is per unit time, leading to $[L^2 T^{-3}]$.\n- Smallest length scale (Kolmogorov length scale), $\\eta$: $[L]$\n- Smallest time scale (Kolmogorov time scale), $\\tau_{\\eta}$: $[T]$\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$. We assume a relationship of the form:\n$$ \\eta = C \\nu^a \\epsilon^b $$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant, conventionally taken as $C=1$. Expressing this relationship in terms of fundamental dimensions ($L$ for length, $T$ for time):\n$$ [L]^1 [T]^0 = ([L^2 T^{-1}])^a ([L^2 T^{-3}])^b $$\n$$ [L]^1 [T]^0 = [L]^{2a} [T]^{-a} [L]^{2b} [T]^{-3b} $$\n$$ [L]^1 [T]^0 = [L]^{2a+2b} [T]^{-a-3b} $$\nEquating the exponents for each dimension on both sides of the equation yields a system of two linear equations for the exponents $a$ and $b$:\n1. For dimension $L$: $1 = 2a + 2b$\n2. For dimension $T$: $0 = -a - 3b$\n\nFrom the second equation, we find $a = -3b$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$ 1 = 2(-3b) + 2b = -6b + 2b = -4b $$\nThis gives $b = -1/4$. Consequently, $a = -3(-1/4) = 3/4$.\nThus, the Kolmogorov length scale is:\n$$ \\eta = \\nu^{3/4} \\epsilon^{-1/4} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/4} $$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$. We assume a similar relationship:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = K \\nu^c \\epsilon^d $$\nwhere $K$ is another dimensionless constant, also taken as $K=1$. In terms of dimensions:\n$$ [L]^0 [T]^1 = ([L^2 T^{-1}])^c ([L^2 T^{-3}])^d $$\n$$ [L]^0 [T]^1 = [L]^{2c+2d} [T]^{-c-3d} $$\nThis yields another system of linear equations for the exponents $c$ and $d$:\n1. For dimension $L$: $0 = 2c + 2d$\n2. For dimension $T$: $1 = -c - 3d$\n\nFrom the first equation, we find $c = -d$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$ 1 = -(-d) - 3d = d - 3d = -2d $$\nThis gives $d = -1/2$. Consequently, $c = -(-1/2) = 1/2$.\nThus, the Kolmogorov time scale is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = \\nu^{1/2} \\epsilon^{-1/2} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for the given parameters: $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and $\\epsilon = 50 \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s^3}$.\n\nFor the Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = \\left(\\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{-5})^3}{50}\\right)^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{3.375 \\times 10^{-15}}{50}\\right)^{1/4} = (6.75 \\times 10^{-17})^{1/4} $$\n$$ \\eta \\approx 9.06422 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\eta = 9.064 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFor the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = \\left(\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}{50}\\right)^{1/2} = (3 \\times 10^{-7})^{1/2} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} \\approx 5.47722 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\tau_{\\eta} = 5.477 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the physical meaning of these scales in the context of turbulence–chemistry interaction. The Kolmogorov scales represent the smallest scales of turbulent motion before viscous forces dominate and dissipate the kinetic energy of the eddies into heat.\nThe computed length scale is $\\eta \\approx 90.6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. A typical premixed hydrocarbon-air flame has a laminar flame thickness, $\\delta_L$, on the order of several hundred micrometers (e.g., $\\delta_L \\approx 400 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for methane-air). This flame structure consists of a relatively thick preheat zone and a much thinner inner reaction zone, $\\delta_r$, which is typically about one-tenth the total thickness (e.g., $\\delta_r \\approx 40 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\nIn our case, we observe the ordering $\\delta_r  \\eta  \\delta_L$. This inequality has a crucial implication for the combustion regime, as visualized on a Borghi-Peters diagram.\n- Since $\\eta  \\delta_L$, the smallest eddies are small enough to penetrate the preheat zone of the flame. This enhances the transport of heat and species, effectively thickening the flame front.\n- Since $\\eta > \\delta_r$, the eddies are still too large to enter and disrupt the thin reaction zone. The reaction layer remains an internally contiguous structure, although it is heavily strained and wrinkled by the turbulent motions.\nThis scenario corresponds to the \"thin reaction zones\" regime (in Peters' terminology) or the \"thickened-wrinkled flame\" regime. Turbulence significantly alters the flame's internal structure but does not completely disrupt the chemistry to the point of creating distributed reaction zones.\n\nThe computed time scale is $\\tau_{\\eta} \\approx 0.548 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$. This is the characteristic lifetime or turnover time of the smallest eddies. A characteristic chemical time, $\\tau_c$, can be estimated as the time for a fluid particle to traverse the laminar flame, $\\tau_c = \\delta_L / s_L$, where $s_L$ is the laminar flame speed (e.g., $s_L \\approx 0.4 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$). Using $\\delta_L \\approx 400 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, we get $\\tau_c \\approx (4 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}) / (0.4 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}) = 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$.\nThe ratio of these time scales defines the Karlovitz number at the Kolmogorov scale, $Ka_{\\eta} = \\tau_c / \\tau_{\\eta}$.\n$$ Ka_{\\eta} \\approx \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{ms}}{0.548 \\, \\mathrm{ms}} \\approx 1.83 $$\nA Karlovitz number greater than $1$ means that the chemical processes are slower than the rate of strain imposed by the smallest turbulent eddies ($1/\\tau_{\\eta}$). This confirms that the flame structure is significantly affected by turbulence, consistent with the conclusion from the length scale analysis. The boundary $Ka=1$ (the Klimov-Williams criterion) is often used to demarcate the flamelet regime from regimes with stronger turbulent interaction. The fact that $Ka_{\\eta} > 1$ firmly places the combustion process outside the simple wrinkled flamelet regime.\n\nIn summary, the computed scales indicate that the smallest eddies are able to penetrate the flame's preheat zone, but not its reaction zone, placing the combustion in the thin reaction zones regime where turbulent transport broadens the flame structure while the chemistry remains confined to a thin, contorted layer.",

Therefore, a complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Damköhler number ($Da$) and the Karlovitz number ($Ka$) for a premixed flame in a turbulent flow.\n\n**1. Derivation of Governing Non-Dimensional Numbers**\n\nWe begin by defining the three characteristic time scales involved, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe large-eddy turnover time, $\\tau_t$, is the characteristic time associated with the largest, energy-containing eddies in the turbulent flow. It is defined as the ratio of the integral length scale, $L$, to the turbulent root-mean-square fluctuation velocity, $u'$.\n$$\n\\tau_t = \\frac{L}{u'}\n$$\n\nThe chemical time scale, $\\tau_c$, is a representative time for the chemical reactions to be completed as a fluid element passes through the flame front. It is defined as the ratio of the laminar flame thermal thickness, $\\delta_L$, to the laminar flame speed, $s_L$.\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{\\delta_L}{s_L}\n$$\n\nThe Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_\\eta$, is the characteristic time of the smallest eddies in the turbulence cascade, where kinetic energy is dissipated into heat by viscosity. The problem states that $\\tau_\\eta$ can be expressed solely in terms of the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$. We use dimensional analysis to find this relationship. The dimensions of the quantities are:\n- Kinematic viscosity, $[\\nu] = \\mathrm{L}^2 \\mathrm{T}^{-1}$\n- Dissipation rate, $[\\epsilon] = \\mathrm{L}^2 \\mathrm{T}^{-3}$\nWe seek a combination $\\tau_\\eta \\propto \\nu^a \\epsilon^b$ such that the resulting dimension is time, $\\mathrm{T}$.\n$$\n[\\tau_\\eta] = [\\nu]^a [\\epsilon]^b = (\\mathrm{L}^2 \\mathrm{T}^{-1})^a (\\mathrm{L}^2 \\mathrm{T}^{-3})^b = \\mathrm{L}^{2a+2b} \\mathrm{T}^{-a-3b}\n$$\nFor the result to have dimensions of time, we must have:\n- Exponent of $\\mathrm{L}$: $2a+2b = 0 \\implies a = -b$\n- Exponent of $\\mathrm{T}$: $-a-3b = 1$\nSubstituting $a = -b$ into the second equation gives $b - 3b = 1$, which yields $-2b = 1$, so $b = -1/2$. Consequently, $a = 1/2$.\nThus, the Kolmogorov time scale is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_\\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}}\n$$\n\nNow we derive the expressions for the Damköhler and Karlovitz numbers based on their definitions.\n\nThe Damköhler number, $Da$, compares the large-eddy turnover time to the chemical time.\n$$\nDa = \\frac{\\tau_t}{\\tau_c} = \\frac{L/u'}{\\delta_L/s_L}\n$$\nThis gives the final formula for the Damköhler number:\n$$\nDa = \\frac{L s_L}{u' \\delta_L}\n$$\n\nThe Karlovitz number, $Ka$, compares the chemical time to the Kolmogorov time.\n$$\nKa = \\frac{\\tau_c}{\\tau_\\eta} = \\frac{\\delta_L/s_L}{\\sqrt{\\nu/\\epsilon}}\n$$\nThis gives the final formula for the Karlovitz number:\n$$\nKa = \\frac{\\delta_L}{s_L} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\nu}}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**2.

The condition $\\eta = 0.1\\,\\delta_L$ describes a specific, physically realistic combustion regime (the thin reaction zones regime). The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not ambiguous, and contains no contradictory information.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Karlovitz number, $Ka$, and then to compute its value under a specified condition.\n\nThe Karlovitz number, $Ka$, is defined as the ratio of the characteristic time scale of the laminar flame, $\\tau_F$, to the Kolmogorov time scale of the turbulence, $\\tau_\\eta$.\n$$Ka = \\frac{\\tau_F}{\\tau_\\eta}$$\n\nFirst, we establish the expression for the flame time scale, $\\tau_F$. The characteristic time of a laminar flame is the time required for heat to diffuse across the preheat zone of the flame. This diffusive time scale is given by:\n$$\\tau_F \\sim \\frac{\\delta_L^2}{\\alpha}$$\nwhere $\\delta_L$ is the laminar flame thickness and $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity. The problem states that due to an approximately unity Prandtl number ($\\mathrm{Pr} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} \\approx 1$), the thermal diffusivity can be taken as approximately equal to the kinematic viscosity, $\\alpha \\approx \\nu$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\tau_F$ yields:\n$$\\tau_F = \\frac{\\delta_L^2}{\\nu}$$\n(Note: An alternative but equivalent approach is to define $\\tau_F = \\frac{\\delta_L}{S_L}$, where $S_L$ is the laminar flame speed. For $\\mathrm{Le} \\approx 1$, the flame thickness scales as $\\delta_L \\sim \\frac{\\alpha}{S_L}$. With $\\alpha \\approx \\nu$, we have $S_L \\approx \\frac{\\nu}{\\delta_L}$. Substituting this into the time scale definition gives $\\tau_F = \\frac{\\delta_L}{(\\nu/\\delta_L)} = \\frac{\\delta_L^2}{\\nu}$, confirming our expression.)\n\nNext, we define the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_\\eta$. The Kolmogorov microscales are the smallest scales in a turbulent flow, where viscosity dominates and the turbulent kinetic energy is dissipated into heat. The Kolmogorov time scale is defined in terms of the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the mean rate of dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy per unit mass, $\\epsilon$. The definition is:\n$$\\tau_\\eta = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $\\tau_F$ and $\\tau_\\eta$ into the definition of the Karlovitz number:\n$$Ka = \\frac{\\tau_F}{\\tau_\\eta} = \\frac{\\delta_L^2 / \\nu}{(\\nu/\\epsilon)^{1/2}} = \\frac{\\delta_L^2}{\\nu} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\nu}\\right)^{1/2}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the Karlovitz number $Ka$ in terms of $\\delta_L$, $\\nu$, and $\\epsilon$.\n\nTo compute the value of $Ka$ for the given condition, it is useful to express $Ka$ in terms of length scales. The Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$, is defined as:\n$$\\eta = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/4}$$\nLet us relate $Ka$ to the ratio of flame thickness $\\delta_L$ to the Kolmogorov length $\\eta$. We can square the expression for $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta^2 = \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/4}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2} = \\nu \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2}$$\nRecognizing that $\\tau_\\eta = (\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon})^{1/2}$, we can write:\n$$\\eta^2 = \\nu \\tau_\\eta$$\nFrom this, we can express the Kolmogorov time scale as $\\tau_\\eta = \\frac{\\eta^2}{\\nu}$. Now we substitute this and the expression for $\\tau_F$ into the definition of $Ka$:\n$$Ka = \\frac{\\tau_F}{\\tau_\\eta} = \\frac{\\delta_L^2 / \\nu}{\\eta^2 / \\nu} = \\frac{\\delta_L^2}{\\eta^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\delta_L}{\\eta}\\right)^2$$\nThis provides an alternative, and for this problem more direct, definition of the Karlovitz number.\n\nThe problem specifies the condition that the Kolmogorov length scale equals one-tenth of the laminar flame thickness:\n$$\\eta = 0.1\\,\\delta_L$$\nFrom this condition, we can find the ratio $\\frac{\\delta_L}{\\eta}$:\n$$\\frac{\\delta_L}{\\eta} = \\frac{\\delta_L}{0.1\\,\\delta_L} = \\frac{1}{0.1} = 10$$\nFinally, we substitute this ratio into our derived expression for $Ka$:\n$$Ka = \\left(\\frac{\\delta_L}{\\eta}\\right)^2 = (10)^2 = 100$$\nThe Karlovitz number is a dimensionless quantity. A value of $Ka = 100$ indicates that the flame is in the thin reaction zones regime, where the smallest turbulent eddies are smaller than the flame's preheat zone but larger than its inner reaction layer, causing significant wrinkling and stretching of the flame front.",
