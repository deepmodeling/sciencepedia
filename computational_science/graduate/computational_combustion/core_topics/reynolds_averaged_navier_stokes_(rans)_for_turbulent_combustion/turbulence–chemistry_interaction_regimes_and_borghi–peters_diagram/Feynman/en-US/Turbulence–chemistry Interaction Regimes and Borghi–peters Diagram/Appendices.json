In the framework of the Borghi–Peters diagram for turbulence–chemistry interaction in premixed combustion, the Damköhler number and the Karlovitz number are defined from fundamental time scales as follows: the Damköhler number compares a representative large-eddy turnover time to a representative chemical time associated with the laminar flame, while the Karlovitz number compares the same chemical time to the smallest-eddy (Kolmogorov) time.

It presents a standard exercise in the field of turbulent combustion, using established definitions and physically plausible data. All necessary information is provided, and the questions are unambiguous. Therefore, a complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Damköhler number ($Da$) and the Karlovitz number ($Ka$) for a premixed flame in a turbulent flow.\n\n**1. Derivation of Governing Non-Dimensional Numbers**\n\nWe begin by defining the three characteristic time scales involved, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe large-eddy turnover time, $\\tau_t$, is the characteristic time associated with the largest, energy-containing eddies in the turbulent flow. It is defined as the ratio of the integral length scale, $L$, to the turbulent root-mean-square fluctuation velocity, $u'$.\n$$\n\\tau_t = \\frac{L}{u'}\n$$\n\nThe chemical time scale, $\\tau_c$, is a representative time for the chemical reactions to be completed as a fluid element passes through the flame front. It is defined as the ratio of the laminar flame thermal thickness, $\\delta_L$, to the laminar flame speed, $s_L$.\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{\\delta_L}{s_L}\n$$\n\nThe Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_k$, is the characteristic time of the smallest eddies in the turbulence cascade, where kinetic energy is dissipated into heat by viscosity. The problem states that $\\tau_k$ can be expressed solely in terms of the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$. We use dimensional analysis to find this relationship. The dimensions of the quantities are:\n- Kinematic viscosity, $[\\nu] = \\mathrm{L}^2 \\mathrm{T}^{-1}$\n- Dissipation rate, $[\\epsilon] = \\mathrm{L}^2 \\mathrm{T}^{-3}$\nWe seek a combination $\\tau_k \\propto \\nu^a \\epsilon^b$ such that the resulting dimension is time, $\\mathrm{T}$.\n$$\n[\\tau_k] = [\\nu]^a [\\epsilon]^b = (\\mathrm{L}^2 \\mathrm{T}^{-1})^a (\\mathrm{L}^2 \\mathrm{T}^{-3})^b = \\mathrm{L}^{2a+2b} \\mathrm{T}^{-a-3b}\n$$\nFor the result to have dimensions of time, we must have:\n- Exponent of $\\mathrm{L}$: $2a+2b = 0 \\implies a = -b$\n- Exponent of $\\mathrm{T}$: $-a-3b = 1$\nSubstituting $a = -b$ into the second equation gives $b - 3b = 1$, which yields $-2b = 1$, so $b = -1/2$. Consequently, $a = 1/2$.\nThus, the Kolmogorov time scale is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}}\n$$\n\nNow we derive the expressions for the Damköhler and Karlovitz numbers based on their definitions.\n\nThe Damköhler number, $Da$, compares the large-eddy turnover time to the chemical time.\n$$\nDa = \\frac{\\tau_t}{\\tau_c} = \\frac{L/u'}{\\delta_L/s_L}\n$$\nThis gives the final formula for the Damköhler number:\n$$\nDa = \\frac{L s_L}{u' \\delta_L}\n$$\n\nThe Karlovitz number, $Ka$, compares the chemical time to the Kolmogorov time.\n$$\nKa = \\frac{\\tau_c}{\\tau_k} = \\frac{\\delta_L/s_L}{\\sqrt{\\nu/\\epsilon}}\n$$\nThis gives the final formula for the Karlovitz number:\n$$\nKa = \\frac{\\delta_L}{s_L} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon}{\\nu}}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n**2. Numerical Calculation**\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values of $Da$ and $Ka$ using the provided data. First, we ensure all data are in consistent SI units.\n- $u' = 2\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $L = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\delta_{L} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $s_{L} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$\n- $\\epsilon = 50\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s^{3}}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formulas.\n\nFor the Damköhler number:\n$$\nDa = \\frac{(0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (0.4\\,\\mathrm{m/s})}{(2\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{0.008}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = 8\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $Da = 8.00$.\n\nFor the Karlovitz number:\n$$\nKa = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.4\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} \\sqrt{\\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s^{3}}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}}}\n$$\n$$\nKa = (1.25 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\sqrt{\\frac{50}{1.5} \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}} = (1.25 \\times 10^{-3}) \\sqrt{33.333... \\times 10^5}\n$$\n$$\nKa = (1.25 \\times 10^{-3}) \\sqrt{3.333333... \\times 10^6} = (1.25 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1.82574... \\times 10^3)\n$$\n$$\nKa \\approx 2.282177\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $Ka = 2.28$.\n\nThe calculated values are $Da = 8.00$ and $Ka = 2.28$. These values place the combustion process in the \"thin reaction zones\" regime of the Borghi–Peters diagram, where the turbulent eddies can penetrate into the flame preheat zone but not into the inner reaction layer.",

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its language. We proceed with the solution, which consists of three parts: the derivation of the Kolmogorov scales, their numerical computation, and a physical interpretation in the context of turbulent combustion.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the smallest turbulent length and time scales based on dimensional analysis. According to the Kolmogorov hypotheses, in the viscous dissipation range of turbulence, the relevant physical quantities are the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, and the mean rate of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation per unit mass, $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe dimensions of these quantities are:\n- Kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$: $[L^2 T^{-1}]$\n- Dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$: $[L^2 T^{-3}]$. Note that energy per unit mass has dimensions of velocity squared, $([L T^{-1}])^2 = [L^2 T^{-2}]$, and a rate is per unit time, leading to $[L^2 T^{-3}]$.\n- Smallest length scale (Kolmogorov length scale), $\\eta$: $[L]$\n- Smallest time scale (Kolmogorov time scale), $\\tau_{\\eta}$: $[T]$\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$. We assume a relationship of the form:\n$$ \\eta = C \\nu^a \\epsilon^b $$\nwhere $C$ is a dimensionless constant, conventionally taken as $C=1$. Expressing this relationship in terms of fundamental dimensions ($L$ for length, $T$ for time):\n$$ [L]^1 [T]^0 = ([L^2 T^{-1}])^a ([L^2 T^{-3}])^b $$\n$$ [L]^1 [T]^0 = [L]^{2a} [T]^{-a} [L]^{2b} [T]^{-3b} $$\n$$ [L]^1 [T]^0 = [L]^{2a+2b} [T]^{-a-3b} $$\nEquating the exponents for each dimension on both sides of the equation yields a system of two linear equations for the exponents $a$ and $b$:\n1. For dimension $L$: $1 = 2a + 2b$\n2. For dimension $T$: $0 = -a - 3b$\n\nFrom the second equation, we find $a = -3b$. Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$ 1 = 2(-3b) + 2b = -6b + 2b = -4b $$\nThis gives $b = -1/4$. Consequently, $a = -3(-1/4) = 3/4$.\nThus, the Kolmogorov length scale is:\n$$ \\eta = \\nu^{3/4} \\epsilon^{-1/4} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu^3}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/4} $$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$. We assume a similar relationship:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = K \\nu^c \\epsilon^d $$\nwhere $K$ is another dimensionless constant, also taken as $K=1$. In terms of dimensions:\n$$ [L]^0 [T]^1 = ([L^2 T^{-1}])^c ([L^2 T^{-3}])^d $$\n$$ [L]^0 [T]^1 = [L]^{2c+2d} [T]^{-c-3d} $$\nThis yields another system of linear equations for the exponents $c$ and $d$:\n1. For dimension $L$: $0 = 2c + 2d$\n2. For dimension $T$: $1 = -c - 3d$\n\nFrom the first equation, we find $c = -d$. Substituting this into the second equation:\n$$ 1 = -(-d) - 3d = d - 3d = -2d $$\nThis gives $d = -1/2$. Consequently, $c = -(-1/2) = 1/2$.\nThus, the Kolmogorov time scale is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = \\nu^{1/2} \\epsilon^{-1/2} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for the given parameters: $\\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and $\\epsilon = 50 \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s^3}$.\n\nFor the Kolmogorov length scale, $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = \\left(\\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{-5})^3}{50}\\right)^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{3.375 \\times 10^{-15}}{50}\\right)^{1/4} = (6.75 \\times 10^{-17})^{1/4} $$\n$$ \\eta \\approx 9.06422 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\eta = 9.064 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFor the Kolmogorov time scale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} = \\left(\\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-5}}{50}\\right)^{1/2} = (3 \\times 10^{-7})^{1/2} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\eta} \\approx 5.47722 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\tau_{\\eta} = 5.477 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the physical meaning of these scales in the context of turbulence–chemistry interaction. The Kolmogorov scales represent the smallest scales of turbulent motion before viscous forces dominate and dissipate the kinetic energy of the eddies into heat.\nThe computed length scale is $\\eta \\approx 90.6 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. A typical premixed hydrocarbon-air flame has a laminar flame thickness, $\\delta_L$, on the order of several hundred micrometers (e.g., $\\delta_L \\approx 400 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for methane-air). This flame structure consists of a relatively thick preheat zone and a much thinner inner reaction zone, $\\delta_r$, which is typically about one-tenth the total thickness (e.g., $\\delta_r \\approx 40 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$).\nIn our case, we observe the ordering $\\delta_r  \\eta  \\delta_L$. This inequality has a crucial implication for the combustion regime, as visualized on a Borghi-Peters diagram.\n- Since $\\eta  \\delta_L$, the smallest eddies are small enough to penetrate the preheat zone of the flame. This enhances the transport of heat and species, effectively thickening the flame front.\n- Since $\\eta  \\delta_r$, the eddies are still too large to enter and disrupt the thin reaction zone. The reaction layer remains an internally contiguous structure, although it is heavily strained and wrinkled by the turbulent motions.\nThis scenario corresponds to the \"thin reaction zones\" regime (in Peters' terminology) or the \"thickened-wrinkled flame\" regime. Turbulence significantly alters the flame's internal structure but does not completely disrupt the chemistry to the point of creating distributed reaction zones.\n\nThe computed time scale is $\\tau_{\\eta} \\approx 0.548 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$. This is the characteristic lifetime or turnover time of the smallest eddies. A characteristic chemical time, $\\tau_c$, can be estimated as the time for a fluid particle to traverse the laminar flame, $\\tau_c = \\delta_L / s_L$, where $s_L$ is the laminar flame speed (e.g., $s_L \\approx 0.4 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$). Using $\\delta_L \\approx 400 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, we get $\\tau_c \\approx (4 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{m}) / (0.4 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}) = 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$.\nThe ratio of these time scales defines the Karlovitz number at the Kolmogorov scale, $Ka_{\\eta} = \\tau_c / \\tau_{\\eta}$.\n$$ Ka_{\\eta} \\approx \\frac{1 \\, \\mathrm{ms}}{0.548 \\, \\mathrm{ms}} \\approx 1.83 $$\nA Karlovitz number greater than $1$ means that the chemical processes are slower than the rate of strain imposed by the smallest turbulent eddies ($1/\\tau_{\\eta}$). This confirms that the flame structure is significantly affected by turbulence, consistent with the conclusion from the length scale analysis. The boundary $Ka=1$ (the Klimov-Williams criterion) is often used to demarcate the flamelet regime from regimes with stronger turbulent interaction. The fact that $Ka_{\\eta}  1$ firmly places the combustion process outside the simple wrinkled flamelet regime.\n\nIn summary, the computed scales indicate that the smallest eddies are able to penetrate the flame's preheat zone, but not its reaction zone, placing the combustion in the thin reaction zones regime where turbulent transport broadens the flame structure while the chemistry remains confined to a thin, contorted layer.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of turbulent premixed combustion, is well-posed with a clear, self-contained set of definitions and parameters, and is expressed in objective, formal language. A unique, verifiable solution can be determined for each test case.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first generating a synthetic dataset for the turbulent root-mean-square velocity fluctuation, `$u'$`, and then calculating the key dimensionless numbers that govern the combustion regime: the Damköhler number, `$Da$`, the Karlovitz number, `$Ka$`, and the velocity ratio, `$r$`. Based on these numbers, each data point is classified into a specific regime, and transition indices between regimes are identified.\n\nThe methodology for each dataset is as follows:\n\nFirst, we generate the primary variable, `$u'$`, as a vector of `$N$` points linearly spaced between `$u'_{min}$` and `$u'_{max}$`, inclusive.\n$$\nu' = \\text{linspace}(u'_{min}, u'_{max}, N)\n$$\n\nSecond, we formulate expressions for `$Ka$`, `$Da$`, and `$r$` as functions of `$u'$` and the given physical parameters. The laminar chemical time scale, `$\\tau_{chem}$`, is constant for a given dataset:\n$$\n\\tau_{chem} = \\frac{\\delta_L}{S_L}\n$$\nThe turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate `$\\epsilon$` depends on `$u'$`:\n$$\n\\epsilon(u') = C_\\epsilon \\frac{u'^3}{l}\n$$\nFrom this, we derive the Kolmogorov time scale `$\\tau_\\eta$`:\n$$\n\\tau_\\eta(u') = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu l}{C_\\epsilon u'^3}\\right)^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu l}{C_\\epsilon}} (u')^{-3/2}\n$$\nThe Karlovitz number, `$Ka = \\tau_{chem} / \\tau_\\eta$`, is then expressed as:\n$$\nKa(u') = \\frac{\\tau_{chem}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu l}{C_\\epsilon}} (u')^{-3/2}} = \\left( \\frac{\\delta_L}{S_L} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_\\epsilon}{\\nu l}} \\right) (u')^{3/2}\n$$\nThis shows that `$Ka$` is a monotonically increasing function of `$u'$`, scaling as `$Ka \\propto (u')^{3/2}$`.\n\nThe integral turbulent time scale `$\\tau_t$` is:\n$$\n\\tau_t(u') = \\frac{l}{u'}\n$$\nThe Damköhler number, `$Da = \\tau_t / \\tau_{chem}$`, becomes:\n$$\nDa(u') = \\frac{l/u'}{\\delta_L/S_L} = \\left( \\frac{l S_L}{\\delta_L} \\right) (u')^{-1}\n$$\nThis shows that `$Da$` is a monotonically decreasing function of `$u'$`, scaling as `$Da \\propto (u')^{-1}$`.\n\nFinally, the velocity ratio, `$r = u'/S_L$`, is a simple linear function of `$u'$`.\n\nThird, we implement the classification logic. For each of the `$N$` samples in the generated `$u'$` array, we calculate the corresponding `$Ka$`, `$Da$`, and `$r$` values. We then apply the specified hierarchical rules to categorize each sample and increment the appropriate regime counter. The five mutually exclusive regime categories are: `laminar flamelet`, `corrugated flamelet`, `thin reaction zones`, `distributed reaction`, and `well-stirred reactor`. The rules are applied in the specified order of precedence:\n1. If `$Ka  100$`, the regime is `distributed reaction`.\n2. Else if `$Da  1$`, the regime is `well-stirred reactor`.\n3. Else if `$Ka \\ge 1$`, the regime is `thin reaction zones`.\n4. Else (`$Ka  1$`), the regime is `laminar flamelet` if `$r  1$`, or `corrugated flamelet` if `$r \\ge 1$`.\n\nFourth, we determine the transition indices. Since `$Ka(u')$` is monotonically increasing and `$Da(u')$` is monotonically decreasing, the first index (zero-based) where a threshold is crossed is unique. We search for the first index `i` in the arrays (which correspond to increasing `$u'`) that satisfies each condition:\n- `$Ka[i] \\ge 1$`\n- `$Ka[i]  100$`\n- `$Da[i]  1$`\nIf a condition is never met across the entire dataset, the corresponding index is recorded as `$-1$`.\n\nThese steps are encapsulated in a function that processes a single dataset's parameters `$(S_L, \\delta_L, l, \\nu, C_\\epsilon, N, u'_{min}, u'_{max})$` and returns a list of eight integers: five regime counts followed by three transition indices, in the required order. This function is then called for each of the three test cases provided. The numerical implementation leverages the `numpy` library for efficient vectorized computation of `$u'$`, `$Ka$`, `$Da$`, and `$r$`.",
