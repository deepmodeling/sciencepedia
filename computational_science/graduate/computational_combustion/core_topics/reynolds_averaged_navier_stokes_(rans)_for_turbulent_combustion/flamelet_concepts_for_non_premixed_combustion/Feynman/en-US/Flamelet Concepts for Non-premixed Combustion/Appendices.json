            "problem": "Consider a steady, laminar, non-premixed flamelet formed by mixing a methane-containing fuel stream with a humid oxidizer stream. The mixture fraction is defined following Bilger’s approach based on element conservation (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen). Let the fuel stream be a methane–nitrogen mixture with species mass fractions $Y_{\\mathrm{CH_4}} = 0.90$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 0.10$. The oxidizer stream contains molecular oxygen, water vapor, and nitrogen, with species mass fractions $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.23$, $Y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.03$, and $Y_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 1 - Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} - Y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$.

The given atomic weights are $W_C = 12$, $W_H = 1$, and $W_O = 16$.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Fuel Stream (subscript f)**\n\nThe fuel stream is a mixture of methane ($\\mathrm{CH_4}$) and nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N_2}$) with mass fractions $Y_{\\mathrm{CH_4, f}} = 0.90$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{N_2, f}} = 0.10$.\nThe molar mass of methane is $W_{\\mathrm{CH_4}} = W_C + 4W_H = 12 + 4(1) = 16$.\nThe elemental mass fractions in the fuel stream are:\n- Carbon (from $\\mathrm{CH_4}$): $Y_{C,f} = Y_{\\mathrm{CH_4, f}} \\times \\frac{W_C}{W_{\\mathrm{CH_4}}} = 0.90 \\times \\frac{12}{16} = 0.90 \\times 0.75 = 0.675$.\n- Hydrogen (from $\\mathrm{CH_4}$): $Y_{H,f} = Y_{\\mathrm{CH_4, f}} \\times \\frac{4W_H}{W_{\\mathrm{CH_4}}} = 0.90 \\times \\frac{4}{16} = 0.90 \\times 0.25 = 0.225$.\n- Oxygen: $Y_{O,f} = 0$, as there are no oxygen-containing species in the fuel stream.\n\nNow, we calculate $\\beta_{\\mathrm{f}}$:\n$$\\beta_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\frac{Y_{O,f}}{W_O} - 2\\,\\frac{Y_{C,f}}{W_C} - \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{Y_{H,f}}{W_H} = \\frac{0}{16} - 2\\,\\frac{0.675}{12} - \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{0.225}{1} = 0 - 0.1125 - 0.1125 = -0.225$$\nIn fractional form, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{f}} = -\\frac{9}{40}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Oxidizer Stream (subscript ox)**\n\nThe oxidizer stream contains oxygen ($\\mathrm{O_2}$), water vapor ($\\mathrm{H_2O}$), and nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N_2}$) with mass fractions $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2, ox}} = 0.23$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{H_2O, ox}} = 0.03$.\nThe mass fraction of nitrogen is $Y_{\\mathrm{N_2, ox}} = 1 - Y_{\\mathrm{O_2, ox}} - Y_{\\mathrm{H_2O, ox}} = 1 - 0.23 - 0.03 = 0.74$.\nThe molar mass of water is $W_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 2W_H + W_O = 2(1) + 16 = 18$.\nThe elemental mass fractions in the oxidizer stream are:\n- Carbon: $Y_{C,ox} = 0$.\n- Hydrogen (from $\\mathrm{H_2O}$): $Y_{H,ox} = Y_{\\mathrm{H_2O, ox}} \\times \\frac{2W_H}{W_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = 0.03 \\times \\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{0.06}{18} = \\frac{1}{300}$.\n- Oxygen (from $\\mathrm{O_2}$ and $\\mathrm{H_2O}$): $Y_{O,ox} = Y_{\\mathrm{O_2, ox}} + Y_{\\mathrm{H_2O, ox}} \\times \\frac{W_O}{W_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = 0.23 + 0.03 \\times \\frac{16}{18} = \\frac{23}{100} + \\frac{3}{100} \\times \\frac{16}{18} = \\frac{23}{100} + \\frac{48}{1800} = \\frac{23}{100} + \\frac{4}{150} = \\frac{69+8}{300} = \\frac{77}{300}$.\n\nNow, we calculate $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ox}}$:\n$$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\frac{Y_{O,ox}}{W_O} - 2\\,\\frac{Y_{C,ox}}{W_C} - \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{Y_{H,ox}}{W_H} = \\frac{77/300}{16} - 2\\,\\frac{0}{12} - \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{1/300}{1} = \\frac{77}{4800} - \\frac{1}{600} = \\frac{77 - 8}{4800} = \\frac{69}{4800} = \\frac{23}{1600}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Stoichiometric Mixture Fraction, $Z_{\\mathrm{st}}$**\n\nWith $\\beta_{\\mathrm{f}} = -9/40$ and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 23/1600$, we can compute $Z_{\\mathrm{st}}$:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{st}} = \\frac{-\\beta_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{f}} - \\beta_{\\mathrm{ox}}} = \\frac{-(23/1600)}{(-9/40) - (23/1600)} = \\frac{-23/1600}{(-360/1600) - (23/1600)} = \\frac{-23/1600}{-383/1600} = \\frac{23}{383}$$\nNumerically, this is $Z_{\\mathrm{st}} \\approx 0.060052219...$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $Z_{\\mathrm{st}} = 0.06005$.\n\n**4. Verification of Elemental Balance at Stoichiometry**\n\nThe problem requires verification that at $Z = Z_{\\mathrm{st}}$, the available elemental oxygen mass fraction, $Y_O(Z_{\\mathrm{st}})$, equals the mass fraction of oxygen required to completely oxidize the available carbon and hydrogen, $Y_{O,req}(Z_{\\mathrm{st}})$.\n\nThe stoichiometric oxidation reactions are $\\mathrm{C} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO_2}$ and $2\\mathrm{H_2} + \\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{H_2O}$. On a mass basis, $W_C$ units of carbon require $2W_O$ units of oxygen, and $2W_H$ units of hydrogen require $W_O$ units of oxygen.\nTherefore, the required oxygen mass fraction is:\n$$Y_{O,req} = Y_C \\left(\\frac{2W_O}{W_C}\\right) + Y_H \\left(\\frac{W_O}{2W_H}\\right) = Y_C \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 16}{12}\\right) + Y_H \\left(\\frac{16}{2 \\times 1}\\right) = \\frac{8}{3}Y_C + 8Y_H$$\nThe elemental mass fractions at any point $Z$ are found by linear interpolation between the fuel and oxidizer streams: $Y_k(Z) = ZY_{k,f} + (1-Z)Y_{k,ox}$.\nAt $Z_{\\mathrm{st}} = 23/383$:\n- $Y_C(Z_{\\mathrm{st}}) = \\frac{23}{383} Y_{C,f} + \\frac{360}{383} Y_{C,ox} = \\frac{23}{383}(0.675) + 0 = \\frac{23}{383} \\frac{27}{40} = \\frac{621}{15320}$.\n- $Y_H(Z_{\\mathrm{st}}) = \\frac{23}{383} Y_{H,f} + \\frac{360}{383} Y_{H,ox} = \\frac{23}{383}(0.225) + \\frac{360}{383}\\left(\\frac{1}{300}\\right) = \\frac{23}{383}\\frac{9}{40} + \\frac{360}{114900} = \\frac{207}{15320} + \\frac{48}{15320} = \\frac{255}{15320}$.\n- $Y_O(Z_{\\mathrm{st}}) = \\frac{23}{383} Y_{O,f} + \\frac{360}{383} Y_{O,ox} = 0 + \\frac{360}{383}\\left(\\frac{77}{300}\\right) = \\frac{360 \\times 77}{383 \\times 300} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 77}{383} = \\frac{92.4}{383} = \\frac{924}{3830} = \\frac{462}{1915}$. To match denominators, this is $\\frac{3696}{15320}$.\n\nNow we check if $Y_O(Z_{\\mathrm{st}}) = Y_{O,req}(Z_{\\mathrm{st}})$.\nThe available oxygen is $Y_{O,available} = Y_O(Z_{\\mathrm{st}}) = \\frac{3696}{15320}$.\nThe required oxygen is:\n$$Y_{O,req}(Z_{\\mathrm{st}}) = \\frac{8}{3}Y_C(Z_{\\mathrm{st}}) + 8Y_H(Z_{\\mathrm{st}}) = \\frac{8}{3}\\left(\\frac{621}{15320}\\right) + 8\\left(\\frac{255}{15320}\\right)$$\n$$Y_{O,req}(Z_{\\mathrm{st}}) = \\frac{8 \\times 207}{15320} + \\frac{2040}{15320} = \\frac{1656 + 2040}{15320} = \\frac{3696}{15320}$$\nSince $Y_{O,available} = Y_{O,req}$, the elemental balance is satisfied, which verifies the calculation. The derivation of $Z_{\\mathrm{st}}$ from the condition $\\beta=0$ inherently ensures this balance, and this explicit calculation confirms its correctness.\nThe final value for the stoichiometric mixture fraction, rounded to four significant figures, is $0.06005$.",

At a given location, you have measured the following dimensionless quantities that characterize local interaction between turbulence and chemistry: the Damköhler number $Da$, the Karlovitz number $Ka$, and the ratio of the measured local scalar thickness to the Kolmogorov length scale $r = \\delta_{s}/\\eta$, where $\\eta$ denotes the Kolmogorov length scale and $\\delta_{s}$ denotes the thickness of the local diffusion–reaction layer estimated from a conservative scalar (e.g., mixture fraction) profile.

            "solution": "The problem asks to determine if a local state in a turbulent non-premixed reacting flow is consistent with the flamelet assumption, based on three measured dimensionless quantities: the Damköhler number, $Da$, the Karlovitz number, $Ka$, and the ratio of the scalar thickness to the Kolmogorov length scale, $r$. The conclusion is to be encoded in an indicator variable $I$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the physical principles underlying the non-premixed flamelet concept. The flamelet model posits that a turbulent flame can be viewed as an ensemble of thin, quasi-steady, one-dimensional laminar diffusion flame structures. These flamelets are advected, stretched, and strained by the turbulent flow but maintain their internal one-dimensional structure. The validity of this model hinges on a critical assumption of scale separation. Specifically, the characteristic length and time scales of the chemical reaction must be significantly smaller than the corresponding scales of the turbulent fluid motion.\n\nWe will assess the given data against the necessary conditions for the flamelet regime.\n\n1.  **Condition on Length Scales:**\n    The most fundamental requirement for the flamelet concept is that the reaction-diffusion layer must be thinner than the smallest scales of turbulence. The smallest turbulent length scale is the Kolmogorov microscale, denoted by $\\eta$. The thickness of the reaction-diffusion layer can be estimated from the profile of a conserved scalar (like the mixture fraction), denoted here as $\\delta_s$. For the flamelet's internal structure to be unaffected by turbulent eddies, it must be geometrically embedded within the smallest dissipative structures. This leads to the condition:\n    $$\n    \\delta_s  \\eta\n    $$\n    The problem provides a dimensionless ratio $r$ precisely for evaluating this condition:\n    $$\n    r = \\frac{\\delta_s}{\\eta}\n    $$\n    The measured value is $r = 0.60$. Since $0.60  1$, the condition $\\delta_s  \\eta$ is satisfied. This provides strong evidence that the reaction zone is sufficiently thin relative to the smallest turbulent eddies to maintain its structure.\n\n2.  **Conditions on Time Scales:**\n    The chemical processes must be fast enough to respond quasi-steadily to the changes imposed by the turbulent flow. This is typically assessed by comparing the chemical time scale, $\\tau_c$, to two different turbulent time scales.\n\n    a) **Comparison with the large-eddy time scale:** The Damköhler number, $Da$, compares the macroscopic turbulent time scale (the large-eddy turnover time, $\\tau_t$) to the characteristic chemical time scale, $\\tau_c$.\n    $$\n    Da = \\frac{\\tau_t}{\\tau_c}\n    $$\n    For chemistry to be considered \"fast\" relative to the overall turbulent mixing process, the Damköhler number must be large. The conventional criterion for entering the flamelet regime is $Da > 1$. The problem states that the measured value is $Da = 1.8$. Since $1.8 > 1$, this condition is met. This implies that the chemical reaction is completed faster than the time it takes for a large turbulent eddy to distort the flame sheet, allowing a flamelet structure to exist. While ideally one would expect $Da \\gg 1$ for a canonical flamelet, a value of $1.8$ is consistent with the regime.\n\n    b) **Comparison with the small-eddy time scale:** The Karlovitz number, $Ka$, compares the chemical time scale, $\\tau_c$, to the turbulent time scale at the Kolmogorov scale, $\\tau_k$.\n    $$\n    Ka = \\frac{\\tau_c}{\\tau_k}\n    $$\n    This number is critical for the flamelet's internal structure. If the chemical time is longer than the Kolmogorov time ($Ka > 1$), the smallest turbulent eddies can penetrate the reaction zone, disrupt the balance between diffusion and reaction, and potentially quench the flame. Therefore, the existence of a flamelet structure requires that chemical processes are faster than the dissipative processes at the smallest scales, which imposes the condition:\n    $$\n    Ka  1\n    $$\n    The measured value is $Ka = 0.90$. Since $0.90  1$, this crucial condition is satisfied. It indicates that the reaction layer is not being torn apart by the smallest scales of turbulence. The condition can also be interpreted in terms of length scales, as $Ka$ is related to the square of the ratio of a characteristic flame thickness $\\delta_L$ to the Kolmogorov scale $\\eta$, i.e., $Ka \\approx (\\delta_L/\\eta)^2$. Thus, $Ka  1$ is consistent with the length-scale separation condition $\\delta_L  \\eta$.\n\n**Conclusion Synthesis:**\nWe have examined the three provided dimensionless parameters against the established criteria for the non-premixed flamelet regime:\n-   The length scale condition, $r = \\delta_s/\\eta  1$, is met since $0.60  1$.\n-   The large-scale time condition, $Da > 1$, is met since $1.8 > 1$.\n-   The small-scale time condition, $Ka  1$, is met since $0.90  1$.\n\nAll three criteria are consistent with the assumptions of flamelet theory. The local state of the flow, as characterized by the given parameters, falls within the non-premixed flamelet combustion regime. Therefore, the indicator variable $I$, which is defined to be $1$ if the local regime is consistent with the flamelet assumption, must be assigned the value $1$.\n\nThe final answer is the value of the indicator $I$.\n$$\nI = 1\n$$",

Thus, $g(c)$ is a monotonically increasing function on $[0,1)$, starting from $g(0)=1+\\Lambda$ and approaching $+\\infty$ as $c \\to 1^-$.\nA solution $c^\\star \\in (0,1)$ to the equation $\\gamma = g(c)$ exists if and only if $\\gamma  g(0)$, which is the condition $\\gamma  1+\\Lambda$.\nIf $\\gamma \\le 1+\\Lambda$, then $\\gamma - g(c) \\le 0$ for all $c \\in [0,1)$, meaning $\\frac{d\\chi_{\\mathrm{st}}}{dc} \\le 0$. The function is monotonically decreasing, and its maximum on $[0,1]$ occurs at the boundary $c=0$. In this case, $c^\\star = 0$.\n\nIf $\\gamma  1+\\Lambda$, a unique internal maximum $c^\\star \\in (0,1)$ exists. To find it, we rearrange the condition $\\gamma = g(c^\\star)$ into a polynomial equation for $c^\\star$:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{(1 + \\Lambda c^\\star) + \\Lambda(1 - c^\\star)}{(1 - c^\\star)(1 + \\Lambda c^\\star)} = \\frac{1+\\Lambda}{1 + (\\Lambda-1)c^\\star - \\Lambda (c^\\star)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma (1 + (\\Lambda-1)c^\\star - \\Lambda (c^\\star)^2) = 1+\\Lambda\n$$\nRearranging into standard quadratic form $a_q(c^\\star)^2 + b_q c^\\star + c_q = 0$:\n$$\n\\gamma\\Lambda (c^\\star)^2 - \\gamma(\\Lambda-1)c^\\star + (1+\\Lambda - \\gamma) = 0\n$$\nor\n$$\n\\gamma\\Lambda (c^\\star)^2 + \\gamma(1-\\Lambda)c^\\star + (1+\\Lambda - \\gamma) = 0\n$$\nThis quadratic equation can be solved for $c^\\star$. The coefficients are $a_q = \\gamma\\Lambda$, $b_q = \\gamma(1-\\Lambda)$, and $c_q = 1+\\Lambda-\\gamma$. Since $\\gamma  1+\\Lambda$, $c_q$ is negative. The product of the roots, $c_q/a_q$, is negative, meaning one root is positive and one is negative. The physically meaningful solution must be the positive root, which is given by:\n$$\nc^\\star = \\frac{-b_q + \\sqrt{b_q^2 - 4 a_q c_q}}{2 a_q}\n$$\nOnce $c^\\star$ is determined, whether it is $0$ or the solution to the quadratic equation, the extinction scalar dissipation rate, $\\chi_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, is calculated by substituting $c^\\star$ into the original function:\n$$\n\\chi_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{st}}(c^\\star) = C \\exp(\\gamma c^\\star)\\,\\frac{1 - c^\\star}{1 + \\Lambda c^\\star}\n$$\nFinally, the extinction strain rate, $a_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, is found by inverting the counterflow relation:\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{k}\n$$\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Calculate $\\gamma$ from the given parameters $E, R, T_u, \\beta$.\n2.  Compare $\\gamma$ with $1+\\Lambda$.\n3.  If $\\gamma  1+\\Lambda$, solve the quadratic equation for the positive root $c^\\star \\in (0,1)$.\n4.  If $\\gamma \\le 1+\\Lambda$, set $c^\\star = 0$.\n5.  Calculate $C = A \\exp(-E/(RT_u))$.\n6.  Calculate $\\chi_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{st}}(c^\\star)$.\n7.  Calculate $a_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\chi_{\\mathrm{ext}} / k$.\nThis procedure will be applied to each of the three parameter sets provided.",
