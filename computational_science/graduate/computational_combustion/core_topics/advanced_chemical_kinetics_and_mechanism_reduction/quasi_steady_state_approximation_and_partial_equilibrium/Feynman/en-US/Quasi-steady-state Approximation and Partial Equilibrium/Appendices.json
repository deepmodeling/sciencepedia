This exercise demonstrates how to formally derive the algebraic constraint imposed by a fast, reversible reaction and use it to determine the effective rate at which a slower reaction consumes the equilibrated species pool. By working through this problem , you will gain a fundamental understanding of how PE allows us to describe the evolution of a system on its slow manifold, a cornerstone of chemical model reduction.",

            "problem": "Consider an isothermal, spatially homogeneous ideal-gas mixture at temperature $T$ in which the fast reversible bimolecular association $A + B \\rightleftharpoons C$ is in Partial Equilibrium (PE) on the timescale of the rest of the network, and a slow irreversible step $C + D \\rightarrow E$ proceeds by mass-action kinetics. Let the concentration of species $i$ be denoted by $c_i$ and the stoichiometric vector for the fast association be $(-1,-1,+1)$ on $(A,B,C)$. Assume ideal-mixture chemical potentials and activities, and a separation of timescales such that the constraint imposed by PE is maintained during the slow evolution.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from the equilibrium condition that the sum of stoichiometric coefficients times chemical potentials vanishes for $A + B \\rightleftharpoons C$, and using $\\mu_i(T,p,X) = \\mu_i^{\\circ}(T) + R T \\ln a_i$ with ideal activities $a_i = c_i/c^{\\circ}$ for a chosen standard concentration $c^{\\circ}$, derive the PE relation for $c_C$ as a function of $c_A$, $c_B$, and the temperature-dependent equilibrium constant $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T)$ defined so that $$c_C = K_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T)\\,c_A\\,c_B.$$ State clearly any redefinition of $K_{\\mathrm{eq}}(T)$ needed to absorb $c^{\\circ}$.\n2.

The stoichiometric vector is:\n$$\n\\nu_{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe law of mass action states that the forward and reverse rates ($r_{f,j}$ and $r_{r,j}$) for an elementary reaction are proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient.\nFor $\\mathrm{R1}$:\n$r_{f,1} = k_{f,1} c_1 c_2$\n$r_{r,1} = k_{r,1} c_4^2$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{R2}$:\n$r_{f,2} = k_{f,2} c_4 c_5$\n$r_{r,2} = k_{r,2} c_3$\n\nPartial equilibrium is the condition where the forward and reverse rates of a reaction are much larger than the net rate of other reactions and are approximately equal, i.e., $r_{f,j} \\approx r_{r,j}$.\nApplying this condition to $\\mathrm{R1}$:\n$k_{f,1} c_1 c_2 = k_{r,1} c_4^2$\nRearranging gives the multiplicative (mass-action ratio) form of the PE constraint:\n$$\n\\frac{c_4^2}{c_1 c_2} = \\frac{k_{f,1}}{k_{r,1}} = K_{c,1}\n$$\nwhere $K_{c,1}$ is the concentration-based equilibrium constant for $\\mathrm{R1}$.\n\nApplying the PE condition to $\\mathrm{R2}$:\n$k_{f,2} c_4 c_5 = k_{r,2} c_3$\nRearranging gives the multiplicative form:\n$$\n\\frac{c_3}{c_4 c_5} = \\frac{k_{f,2}}{k_{r,2}} = K_{c,2}\n$$\nwhere $K_{c,2}$ is the equilibrium constant for $\\mathrm{R2}$.\n\nTo obtain the logarithmic form, we take the natural logarithm of these expressions, which is well-defined as the manifold is restricted to the positive orthant ($c_i>0$).\nFor $\\mathrm{R1}$:\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{c_4^2}{c_1 c_2}\\right) = \\ln(K_{c,1})$\n$2\\ln(c_4) - \\ln(c_1) - \\ln(c_2) = \\ln(K_{c,1})$\nThis can be expressed using the stoichiometric vector $\\nu_1$ and the vector of log-concentrations, $\\ln c = (\\ln c_1, \\dots, \\ln c_5)^{\\mathsf{T}}$:\n$$\n\\nu_1^{\\mathsf{T}} \\ln c = \\ln(K_{c,1})\n$$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{R2}$:\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{c_3}{c_4 c_5}\\right) = \\ln(K_{c,2})$\n$\\ln(c_3) - \\ln(c_4) - \\ln(c_5) = \\ln(K_{c,2})$\nThis can be expressed using the stoichiometric vector $\\nu_2$:\n$$\n\\nu_2^{\\mathsf{T}} \\ln c = \\ln(K_{c,2})\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Compatibility of PE Constraints with Elemental Conservation**\n\nElemental conservation is expressed as the linear system $A\\,c=b$, where $A$ is the elemental composition matrix and $b$ is the vector of total elemental amounts. Any chemical reaction transforms the concentration vector $c$ by adding a multiple of its stoichiometric vector $\\nu_j$. That is, if a reaction $j$ proceeds by an extent $\\xi_j$, the new concentration vector becomes $c' = c + \\xi_j \\nu_j$.\n\nFor the elemental totals to be conserved during the reaction, the new concentration vector $c'$ must also satisfy the conservation law for the same totals $b$, i.e., $A\\,c' = b$. Substituting the expression for $c'$:\n$A(c + \\xi_j \\nu_j) = b$\n$A\\,c + \\xi_j A\\,\\nu_j = b$\nSince we started from a state where $A\\,c=b$, this equation simplifies to $\\xi_j A\\,\\nu_j = 0$. As this must hold for any non-zero extent of reaction ($\\xi_j \\neq 0$), the following structural condition must be met:\n$$\nA\\,\\nu_j = 0\n$$\nThis condition states that any valid stoichiometric vector must lie in the null space of the elemental composition matrix. It is the mathematical embodiment of the principle that chemical reactions only rearrange atoms and do not create or destroy them. The PE constraints, being derived from these reactions, are thus compatible with elemental conservation if and only if their corresponding stoichiometric vectors satisfy this condition.\n\nLet's verify this for the given system.\nThe elemental composition matrix is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor $\\nu_1 = (-1, -1, 0, 2, 0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$:\n$$\nA\\,\\nu_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(-1) + 0(-1) + 2(0) + 1(2) + 1(0) \\\\ 0(-1) + 2(-1) + 1(0) + 1(2) + 0(0) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $\\nu_2 = (0, 0, 1, -1, -1)^{\\mathsf{T}}$:\n$$\nA\\,\\nu_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2(1) + 1(-1) + 1(-1) \\\\ 1(1) + 1(-1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $A\\,\\nu_1 = 0$ and $A\\,\\nu_2 = 0$, both PE constraints are structurally compatible with the elemental conservation laws.\n\n**Part 3: Dimension of the Admissible Composition Manifold**\n\nThe admissible composition manifold $\\mathcal{M}$ is a subset of the $5$-dimensional concentration space $\\mathbb{R}_{>0}^{5}$ defined by a set of independent constraints. The dimension of this manifold is given by the dimension of the ambient space minus the total number of independent constraints.\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathcal{M}) = N - (\\text{number of independent constraints})\n$$\nwhere $N=5$ is the number of species.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1.  Elemental Conservation: $A\\,c = b$. These are two linear equations. To find the number of independent constraints, we find the rank of $A$.\n    $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The two rows of $A$ are clearly linearly independent (e.g., the second column is non-zero only in the second row). Therefore, $\\mathrm{rank}(A) = 2$. These two linear constraints confine the state to an affine subspace of dimension $N-\\mathrm{rank}(A) = 5-2=3$.\n\n2.  Partial Equilibrium: These are two nonlinear constraints, $\\nu_1^{\\mathsf{T}} \\ln c = \\ln(K_{c,1})$ and $\\nu_2^{\\mathsf{T}} \\ln c = \\ln(K_{c,2})$. The number of independent PE constraints, $N_{PE}$, is the number of linearly independent stoichiometric vectors $\\nu_j$.\n    The vectors are $\\nu_1 = (-1, -1, 0, 2, 0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$ and $\\nu_2 = (0, 0, 1, -1, -1)^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n    These two vectors are linearly independent. A linear combination $k_1 \\nu_1 + k_2 \\nu_2 = 0$ implies $k_1(-1, -1, 0, 2, 0)^{\\mathsf{T}} + k_2(0, 0, 1, -1, -1)^{\\mathsf{T}} = (0,0,0,0,0)^{\\mathsf{T}}$. Looking at the first component, $-k_1 = 0$, which implies $k_1=0$. Looking at the third component, $k_2=0$. Thus, the only solution is trivial, and the vectors are linearly independent. This gives $N_{PE}=2$ independent PE constraints.\n\nThe total number of constraints is the sum of the independent linear constraints and the independent PE constraints. The two sets of constraints are independent of each other. This is guaranteed by the condition $A\\nu_j = 0$, which shows that the vectors $\\nu_j$ (which define the PE constraints in logarithmic space) are in the null space of $A$, and thus are orthogonal to the row space of $A$ (which defines the conservation constraints).\n\nThe total number of independent constraints is $\\mathrm{rank}(A) + N_{PE} = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\nThe dimension of the manifold $\\mathcal{M}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\dim(\\mathcal{M}) = N - (\\mathrm{rank}(A) + N_{PE}) = 5 - (2 + 2) = 1\n$$\nThe admissible composition manifold is a one-dimensional curve in the 5-dimensional concentration space.",

Radical loss to inert sink: $R \\rightarrow S$ with rate constant $k_{4}$.\n\nAssume the initial conditions satisfy $[X](0) = 0$ and $[R](0) = 0$, with $[F](0) = F_{0} > 0$, and that the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) for the radical $R$ is externally justified by a separation of timescales such that $k_{3}[F] + k_{4}$ is large compared to the net production rate scale for $R$. You are to examine the interplay between the QSSA for $R$ and the Partial Equilibrium (PE) assumption for the reversible activation step $(1)$.\n\nStarting from the species balance laws implied by mass-action kinetics, derive the QSSA expression for $[R]$ in terms of $[X]$, $[F]$, and the rate constants. Then, enforce Partial Equilibrium (PE) on step $(1)$ by setting the forward and backward rates equal and eliminate $[X]$ accordingly to obtain a predicted $[R]$ that results from combining QSSA for $R$ with PE for step $(1)$. Next, without enforcing PE, compute the steady-state value of $[X]$ that is consistent with its production by step $(1)$ and drain by step $(2)$, and use this to obtain the radical concentration from QSSA without PE.\n\nDefine the inconsistency factor $\\Phi$ as the ratio of the radical concentration predicted by QSSA under enforced PE to the radical concentration predicted by QSSA using the correct steady-state of $X$ without PE. Provide the closed-form analytic expression of $\\Phi$ in terms of the relevant rate constants only, and analyze which parameter regime or initial condition drives $\\Phi \\neq 1$. Your final answer must be the single closed-form expression for $\\Phi$ with no units. If you choose to specialize any parameters numerically, do not do so in your final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in chemical kinetics concerning the application and comparison of the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) and the Partial Equilibrium (PE) assumption. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe chemical mechanism consists of four elementary steps:\n1. $F \\rightleftharpoons X$ (forward rate constant $k_{1f}$, backward rate constant $k_{1b}$)\n2. $X \\rightarrow P + R$ (rate constant $k_{2}$)\n3. $R + F \\rightarrow P'$ (rate constant $k_{3}$)\n4. $R \\rightarrow S$ (rate constant $k_{4}$)\n\nBased on mass-action kinetics, we can write the species balance laws (rate equations) for the intermediate $X$ and the radical $R$ in the homogeneous, constant-volume reactor:\n$$ \\frac{d[X]}{dt} = k_{1f}[F] - k_{1b}[X] - k_{2}[X] = k_{1f}[F] - (k_{1b} + k_{2})[X] $$\n$$ \\frac{d[R]}{dt} = k_{2}[X] - k_{3}[R][F] - k_{4}[R] = k_{2}[X] - (k_{3}[F] + k_{4})[R] $$\n\nThe first task is to derive the QSSA expression for $[R]$. The QSSA for $R$ is justified if $R$ is a highly reactive species, meaning its concentration adjusts rapidly to changes in the slower-moving species $F$ and $X$. Mathematically, this is expressed by setting its net rate of formation to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d[R]}{dt} \\approx 0 $$\nApplying this to the rate equation for $R$:\n$$ k_{2}[X] - (k_{3}[F] + k_{4})[R] = 0 $$\nSolving for $[R]$ yields the general QSSA expression for the radical concentration, which we denote as $[R]_{QSSA}$:\n$$ [R]_{QSSA} = \\frac{k_{2}[X]}{k_{3}[F] + k_{4}} $$\n\nNext, we derive the radical concentration that results from combining the QSSA for $R$ with the Partial Equilibrium (PE) assumption for step ($1$). The PE assumption posits that the forward and backward reactions of step ($1$) are very fast compared to other reactions involving $F$ or $X$, and are therefore nearly balanced.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{1f} \\approx \\text{Rate}_{1b} $$\n$$ k_{1f}[F] = k_{1b}[X] $$\nSolving for the concentration of $X$ under this assumption gives:\n$$ [X]_{PE} = \\frac{k_{1f}}{k_{1b}}[F] $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[X]$ into the QSSA expression for $[R]$ gives the radical concentration predicted under the combined PE and QSSA assumptions, $[R]_{PE+QSSA}$:\n$$ [R]_{PE+QSSA} = \\frac{k_{2}[X]_{PE}}{k_{3}[F] + k_{4}} = \\frac{k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1f}}{k_{1b}}[F] \\right)}{k_{3}[F] + k_{4}} = \\frac{k_{1f}k_{2}[F]}{k_{1b}(k_{3}[F] + k_{4})} $$\n\nNow, we follow an alternative procedure without enforcing PE on step ($1$). Instead, we compute the steady-state value of $[X]$ by applying a steady-state approximation to the intermediate $X$. This is generally a more accurate approach than assuming PE, as it accounts for the net drain of $X$ through step ($2$). We set the net rate of formation of $X$ to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d[X]}{dt} = k_{1f}[F] - (k_{1b} + k_{2})[X] \\approx 0 $$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration of $X$, denoted $[X]_{SS}$:\n$$ (k_{1b} + k_{2})[X]_{SS} = k_{1f}[F] $$\n$$ [X]_{SS} = \\frac{k_{1f}[F]}{k_{1b} + k_{2}} $$\nWe then use this more accurate expression for $[X]$ in the QSSA formula for $[R]$ to obtain $[R]_{SS+QSSA}$:\n$$ [R]_{SS+QSSA} = \\frac{k_{2}[X]_{SS}}{k_{3}[F] + k_{4}} = \\frac{k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1f}[F]}{k_{1b} + k_{2}} \\right)}{k_{3}[F] + k_{4}} = \\frac{k_{1f}k_{2}[F]}{(k_{1b} + k_{2})(k_{3}[F] + k_{4})} $$\n\nThe problem defines the inconsistency factor $\\Phi$ as the ratio of the radical concentration predicted by QSSA with enforced PE to that predicted by QSSA using the more accurate steady-state of $X$:\n$$ \\Phi = \\frac{[R]_{PE+QSSA}}{[R]_{SS+QSSA}} $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$ \\Phi = \\frac{\\frac{k_{1f}k_{2}[F]}{k_{1b}(k_{3}[F] + k_{4})}}{\\frac{k_{1f}k_{2}[F]}{(k_{1b} + k_{2})(k_{3}[F] + k_{4})}} $$\nThe terms $k_{1f}$, $k_{2}$, $[F]$, and $(k_{3}[F] + k_{4})$ cancel, leaving:\n$$ \\Phi = \\frac{\\frac{1}{k_{1b}}}{\\frac{1}{k_{1b} + k_{2}}} = \\frac{k_{1b} + k_{2}}{k_{1b}} $$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression for $\\Phi$:\n$$ \\Phi = 1 + \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1b}} $$\n\nFinally, we analyze the condition that drives $\\Phi \\neq 1$. The expression for $\\Phi$ depends only on the rate constants $k_{2}$ and $k_{1b}$, and not on any initial conditions or on the concentration of fuel $[F]$. Rate constants for physical processes are non-negative, i.e., $k_{2} \\ge 0$ and $k_{1b} \\ge 0$. For the given reaction mechanism to be meaningful, step ($2$) and step ($1b$) must occur, so we assume $k_2 > 0$ and $k_{1b} > 0$.\nUnder this assumption, the ratio $\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1b}}$ is strictly positive. Consequently, $\\Phi = 1 + \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1b}} > 1$. Therefore, $\\Phi$ is unequal to $1$ for any non-trivial instance of this reaction mechanism ($k_2 > 0$).\n\nThe factor $\\Phi$ quantifies the error introduced by incorrectly assuming partial equilibrium for step ($1$). The PE assumption is valid only if the reversible reaction $F \\rightleftharpoons X$ is much faster than any other process that consumes $X$. The rate of consumption of $X$ by deactivation is characterized by $k_{1b}$, while its consumption to produce radicals is characterized by $k_{2}$. The validity condition for PE is thus $k_2 \\ll k_{1b}$. In this regime, $\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1b}} \\approx 0$, and $\\Phi \\approx 1$, meaning the PE assumption is accurate. Conversely, when the rate of radical generation from $X$ (step ($2$)) is comparable to or faster than the rate of deactivation of $X$ back to $F$ (step ($1b$)), i.e., $k_2 \\gtrsim k_{1b}$, the PE assumption breaks down, and $\\Phi$ becomes significantly greater than $1$. This indicates that the simple PE assumption overestimates the concentration of $X$ and, consequently, the concentration of the radical $R$.",
