            "problem": "A two-dimensional, inviscid, zero-thickness, planar premixed flame subject to small-amplitude sinusoidal perturbations of wavenumber magnitude $|k|$ exhibits the Darrieus–Landau (DL) hydrodynamic instability. Let $S_L$ denote the unstrained laminar flame speed, and let the gas expansion ratio be $E \\equiv \\rho_u/\\rho_b > 1$, where $\\rho_u$ and $\\rho_b$ are the densities of the unburned and burned gases, respectively. In classical linear theory for such a flame, the temporal growth rate of a single Fourier mode is given by\n$$\\omega = S_L |k| \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1}.$$\nTreating $S_L$ and $|k|$ as constants, compute the parametric sensitivity of the growth rate with respect to the expansion ratio, $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$, as an explicit analytic function of $E$, $S_L$, and $|k|$. Then, interpret physically the sign and magnitude of this sensitivity in the limits $E \\to 1^+$ and $E \\to \\infty$, and state the units of $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$. Your final reported answer must be the closed-form analytic expression for $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$ only, with no units attached.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the parametric sensitivity of the Darrieus–Landau instability growth rate, $\\omega$, with respect to the gas expansion ratio, $E$. The given expression for the growth rate is:\n$$ \\omega = S_L |k| \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} $$\nwhere $S_L$ is the unstrained laminar flame speed, $|k|$ is the perturbation wavenumber magnitude, and $E = \\rho_u / \\rho_b > 1$ is the expansion ratio. We are tasked with computing the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$, treating $S_L$ and $|k|$ as constants.\n\nTo find the sensitivity, we differentiate the expression for $\\omega$ with respect to $E$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left( S_L |k| \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} \\right) $$\nSince $S_L$ and $|k|$ are treated as constants, we can factor them out of the derivative:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = S_L |k| \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left( \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} \\right) $$\nWe apply the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that for functions $u(E)$ and $v(E)$, $\\frac{d}{dE}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{v \\frac{du}{dE} - u \\frac{dv}{dE}}{v^2}$. Let $u(E) = E - 1$ and $v(E) = E + 1$. Their derivatives with respect to $E$ are:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dE} = \\frac{d}{dE}(E - 1) = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{dv}{dE} = \\frac{d}{dE}(E + 1) = 1 $$\nSubstituting these into the quotient rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial E} \\left( \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} \\right) = \\frac{(E + 1)(1) - (E - 1)(1)}{(E + 1)^2} = \\frac{E + 1 - E + 1}{(E + 1)^2} = \\frac{2}{(E + 1)^2} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$, we obtain the final analytic expression for the sensitivity:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = S_L |k| \\frac{2}{(E + 1)^2} $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the sensitivity of the growth rate with respect to the expansion ratio.\n\nNext, we interpret the sign and magnitude of this sensitivity. The quantities $S_L$ and $|k|$ are physically positive ($S_L > 0$ and $|k| > 0$ for a non-trivial perturbation). The term $(E+1)^2$ is also strictly positive since $E > 1$. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$ is always positive. This signifies that the growth rate of the instability, $\\omega$, is a monotonically increasing function of the expansion ratio $E$. A larger density drop across the flame (i.e., a larger $E$) always leads to a stronger instability, which is physically expected as the instability is driven by the hydrodynamic effect of gas expansion.\n\nWe now analyze the limits as $E \\to 1^+$ and $E \\to \\infty$.\n\nIn the limit of weak expansion, $E \\to 1^+$:\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to 1^+} \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = \\lim_{E \\to 1^+} \\left( S_L |k| \\frac{2}{(E + 1)^2} \\right) = S_L |k| \\frac{2}{(1 + 1)^2} = S_L |k| \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} S_L |k| $$\nIn this limit, the sensitivity is a finite positive value. This means that as soon as the expansion ratio becomes slightly greater than $1$, the instability growth rate begins to increase. The growth rate itself is zero at $E=1$, so this sensitivity describes how rapidly the instability \"turns on\" for flames with very low heat release.\n\nIn the limit of strong expansion, $E \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E} = \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\left( S_L |k| \\frac{2}{(E + 1)^2} \\right) = 0 $$\nAs $E$ becomes very large, the denominator $(E+1)^2$ grows without bound, causing the sensitivity to approach zero. This indicates that while increasing $E$ always increases $\\omega$, the effect diminishes for very strong flames. The growth rate $\\omega$ approaches an asymptotic maximum value in this limit:\n$$ \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\omega = \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\left( S_L |k| \\frac{E - 1}{E + 1} \\right) = S_L |k| \\lim_{E \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{E}}{1 + \\frac{1}{E}} = S_L |k| $$\nThe sensitivity approaching zero reflects the fact that the growth rate is saturating at its theoretical maximum of $S_L |k|$. Further increases in the expansion ratio yield progressively smaller increases in the instability growth rate.\n\nFinally, we determine the units of $\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}$. The growth rate $\\omega$ has units of inverse time, $[T]^{-1}$ (e.g., $s^{-1}$). The expansion ratio $E$ is a ratio of densities, making it dimensionless. Therefore, the units of the sensitivity are:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial E}\\right] = \\frac{[\\omega]}{[E]} = \\frac{[T]^{-1}}{1} = [T]^{-1} $$\nThe units of the sensitivity are inverse time, the same as the growth rate itself. We can verify this from the derived expression: $S_L$ has units of $[L][T]^{-1}$ and $|k|$ has units of $[L]^{-1}$. Their product, $S_L |k|$, has units of $[T]^{-1}$. The term $\\frac{2}{(E+1)^2}$ is dimensionless. Thus, the units are consistent.",
