All provided information is consistent and conforms to established principles in linear systems theory and combustion dynamics. The model for the Flame Transfer Function (FTF) is a standard representation known as a time-delay with a first-order lag. The problem is solvable as stated.\n\nThe Flame Transfer Function (FTF), $G(\\omega)$, is given as a complex function of the angular frequency $\\omega$:\n$$\nG(\\omega)=\\frac{\\beta\\,\\exp(-i\\omega \\tau)}{1+i\\omega T}\n$$\nHere, $\\beta$, $\\tau$, and $T$ are real, positive constants, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. To solve the problem, we will derive expressions for the magnitude $|G(\\omega)|$ and the phase angle $\\angle G(\\omega)$, and then determine the corner frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\nFirst, we derive the magnitude of the FTF, $|G(\\omega)|$. The magnitude of a ratio of two complex numbers is the ratio of their magnitudes. Let the numerator be $z_1 = \\beta\\,\\exp(-i\\omega \\tau)$ and the denominator be $z_2 = 1+i\\omega T$. Then, $|G(\\omega)| = \\frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the numerator, $|z_1|$, is calculated as follows:\n$$\n|z_1| = |\\beta\\,\\exp(-i\\omega \\tau)|\n$$\nSince $\\beta$ is a positive real number, we can write:\n$$\n|z_1| = \\beta\\,|\\exp(-i\\omega \\tau)|\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\exp(-i\\omega \\tau) = \\cos(-\\omega\\tau) + i\\sin(-\\omega\\tau) = \\cos(\\omega\\tau) - i\\sin(\\omega\\tau)$. The magnitude is:\n$$\n|\\exp(-i\\omega \\tau)| = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\omega\\tau) + (-\\sin(\\omega\\tau))^2} = \\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\omega\\tau) + \\sin^2(\\omega\\tau)} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the magnitude of the numerator is $|z_1| = \\beta$.\n\nThe magnitude of the denominator, $|z_2|$, is the magnitude of the complex number $1+i\\omega T$:\n$$\n|z_2| = |1+i\\omega T| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (\\omega T)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\omega^2 T^2}\n$$\nCombining the magnitudes of the numerator and the denominator, we obtain the expression for the magnitude of the FTF:\n$$\n|G(\\omega)| = \\frac{|z_1|}{|z_2|} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{1 + \\omega^2 T^2}}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the phase angle of the FTF, $\\angle G(\\omega)$. The phase of a ratio of two complex numbers is the difference of their phases: $\\angle G(\\omega) = \\angle(z_1) - \\angle(z_2)$.\n\nThe phase of the numerator, $\\angle(z_1)$, is:\n$$\n\\angle(z_1) = \\angle(\\beta\\,\\exp(-i\\omega \\tau))\n$$\nSince $\\beta$ is a positive real number, its phase is $0$. Thus, the phase of the numerator is simply the phase of the complex exponential term:\n$$\n\\angle(z_1) = \\angle(\\exp(-i\\omega \\tau)) = -\\omega\\tau\n$$\nThis is expressed in radians.\n\nThe phase of the denominator, $\\angle(z_2)$, is the phase of the complex number $1+i\\omega T$. This is given by the arctangent of the ratio of the imaginary part to the real part:\n$$\n\\angle(z_2) = \\angle(1+i\\omega T) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega T}{1}\\right) = \\arctan(\\omega T)\n$$\nThis is the principal value, which lies in the interval $(0, \\pi/2)$ since $\\omega > 0$ and $T > 0$.\n\nCombining the phases, we obtain the expression for the phase angle of the FTF:\n$$\n\\angle G(\\omega) = \\angle(z_1) - \\angle(z_2) = -\\omega\\tau - \\arctan(\\omega T)\n$$\nThe result is in radians.\n\nFinally, we determine the corner angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, defined as the frequency at which the magnitude $|G(\\omega)|$ has decreased to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its low-frequency limit. First, we find the low-frequency limit by evaluating $|G(\\omega)|$ as $\\omega \\to 0$:\n$$\n|G(0)| = \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{1 + \\omega^2 T^2}} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{1 + 0}} = \\beta\n$$\nThe condition for the corner frequency $\\omega_c$ is:\n$$\n|G(\\omega_c)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |G(0)|\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $|G(\\omega_c)|$ and $|G(0)|$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{1 + \\omega_c^2 T^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\beta\n$$\nSince $\\beta > 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\omega_c^2 T^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives:\n$$\n\\sqrt{1 + \\omega_c^2 T^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nSquaring both sides yields:\n$$\n1 + \\omega_c^2 T^2 = 2\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega_c^2$:\n$$\n\\omega_c^2 T^2 = 1 \\implies \\omega_c^2 = \\frac{1}{T^2}\n$$\nSince angular frequency $\\omega$ must be non-negative, we take the positive square root:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T^2}} = \\frac{1}{T}\n$$\nThe corner frequency $\\omega_c$ depends only on the relaxation time $T$ and has units of radians per second.\n\nThe three requested quantities are $|G(\\omega)|$, $\\angle G(\\omega)$, and $\\omega_c$.

I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis of the discrepancy between a pure time-delay model of a flame and experimental measurements.\n\n**1. The Pure Time-Delay Model**\n\nA system with a pure time delay $\\tau$ and a constant gain $K$ has a transfer function given by:\n$$G_{delay}(\\omega) = K e^{-i\\omega\\tau}$$\nThe magnitude and phase of this transfer function are:\n$$\\lvert G_{delay}(\\omega) \\rvert = K$$\n$$\\angle G_{delay}(\\omega) = -\\omega\\tau$$\nThe model described in the problem states that $\\lvert G(\\omega) \\rvert$ is independent of $\\omega$ and $\\angle G(\\omega)$ decreases linearly with slope $-\\tau$. This corresponds exactly to the transfer function $G_{delay}(\\omega)$.\n\n**2. Comparison of the Pure Time-Delay Model with Experimental Data**\n\nWe are given $\\tau = 0.005\\,\\text{s}$. Let's calculate the phase predicted by the pure time-delay model at the measured frequencies:\n*   At $\\omega = 100\\,\\text{rad/s}$: Predicted phase $\\angle G_{pred} = -(100\\,\\text{rad/s})(0.005\\,\\text{s}) = -0.50\\,\\text{rad}$.\n*   At $\\omega = 200\\,\\text{rad/s}$: Predicted phase $\\angle G_{pred} = -(200\\,\\text{rad/s})(0.005\\,\\text{s}) = -1.00\\,\\text{rad}$.\n*   At $\\omega = 1000\\,\\text{rad/s}$: Predicted phase $\\angle G_{pred} = -(1000\\,\\text{rad/s})(0.005\\,\\text{s}) = -5.00\\,\\text{rad}$.\n\nNow, we compare these predictions with the measured data:\n\n*   **Magnitude Discrepancy:**\n    *   The model predicts a constant magnitude.\n    *   The data shows a magnitude that decreases with frequency: $\\lvert G(100)\\rvert \\approx 2.0$, $\\lvert G(200)\\rvert \\approx 1.41$, $\\lvert G(1000)\\rvert \\approx 0.40$. This behavior is characteristic of a low-pass filter.\n\n*   **Phase Discrepancy:**\n    *   At $\\omega = 100\\,\\text{rad/s}$: Predicted phase ($-0.50\\,\\text{rad}$) matches the measured phase ($-0.50\\,\\text{rad}$).\n    *   At $\\omega = 200\\,\\text{rad/s}$: The measured phase ($-1.79\\,\\text{rad}$) is more negative than the predicted phase ($-1.00\\,\\text{rad}$). The additional phase lag is $\\Delta\\phi = -1.79 - (-1.00) = -0.79\\,\\text{rad}$.\n    *   At $\\omega = 1000\\,\\text{rad/s}$: The measured phase ($-6.37\\,\\text{rad}$) is significantly more negative than the predicted phase ($-5.00\\,\\text{rad}$). The additional phase lag is $\\Delta\\phi = -6.37 - (-5.00) = -1.37\\,\\text{rad}$.\n\n**3. Interpretation of Discrepancies**\n\nThe flame response is clearly not just a simple time delay. The system must contain at least one other dynamic element which, when combined with the convective time delay, can reproduce the observed behavior. This additional element must:\n1.  Act as a low-pass filter, causing the magnitude to decrease with increasing frequency.\n2.  Introduce an additional, frequency-dependent phase lag (i.e., a negative phase contribution that grows with frequency).\n\nA first-order low-pass filter is the simplest linear system element that satisfies both of these requirements. Its transfer function is:\n$$G_{filter}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_f}$$\nwhere $\\tau_f$ is the characteristic time constant of the filter.\n\nThe magnitude and phase of this filter are:\n$$\\lvert G_{filter}(\\omega) \\rvert = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega\\tau_f)^2}}$$\n$$\\angle G_{filter}(\\omega) = -\\arctan(\\omega\\tau_f)$$\nThe magnitude rolls off at high frequencies, and the phase provides an additional lag that varies from $0$ to a maximum of $-\\pi/2\\,\\text{rad}$.\n\nCombining the convective delay with a first-order filter gives a model of the form:\n$$G_{model}(\\omega) = K e^{-i\\omega\\tau} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_f} \\right)$$\nThe total phase is $\\angle G_{model}(\\omega) = -\\omega\\tau - \\arctan(\\omega\\tau_f)$.\n\nIn combustion dynamics, such a filter is often associated with the \"kinematic\" response of the flame surface, representing the finite time required for flame wrinkles to form, grow, and be destroyed. The characteristic time of this process, $\\tau_f$, is often scaled with the convective time, $\\tau = L/U$. The \"break frequency\" of the filter is $\\omega_b = 1/\\tau_f$. A break frequency near $\\omega \\sim U/L = 1/\\tau = 200\\,\\text{rad/s}$ is suggested by the data, as this is where the deviation from the pure delay model becomes prominent.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with $\\tau_f = \\tau = 0.005\\,\\text{s}$:\n*   Additional phase at $\\omega=200\\,\\text{rad/s}$: $-\\arctan(\\omega\\tau_f) = -\\arctan(200 \\times 0.005) = -\\arctan(1) = -\\pi/4 \\approx -0.785\\,\\text{rad}$. This is an excellent match for the observed additional lag of $-0.79\\,\\text{rad}$.\n*   Additional phase at $\\omega=1000\\,\\text{rad/s}$: $-\\arctan(\\omega\\tau_f) = -\\arctan(1000 \\times 0.005) = -\\arctan(5) \\approx -1.373\\,\\text{rad}$. This is an excellent match for the observed additional lag of $-1.37\\,\\text{rad}$.\n\nThe proposed physical mechanism of a first-order kinematic flame response added to a convective delay is strongly supported by the data.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The data indicate the presence of an intrinsic first-order kinematic flame response in addition to convective delay, acting as a low-pass dynamic on top of the delay; this produces both magnitude attenuation and an additional frequency-dependent phase lag that grows from 0 toward -pi/2 as omega increases beyond a break near omega ~ U/L.**\n\nThis option perfectly matches our derivation. It correctly identifies the need for an additional dynamic element, characterizes it as a first-order response (a common model for flame kinematics), notes its low-pass filtering nature, and correctly describes its effect on both magnitude (attenuation) and phase (additional lag approaching $-\\pi/2$). It also correctly places the break frequency $\\omega \\sim U/L = 1/\\tau$, which is consistent with the provided data where significant deviations begin at $\\mathrm{St}=1.0$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The discrepancy can be fully removed by revising the convective time tau upward (e.g., doubling L or halving U), because a larger pure delay suffices to explain both the observed magnitude attenuation and the extra negative phase.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A pure time-delay system, regardless of the value of the delay $\\tau$, has a transfer function $K e^{-i\\omega\\tau}$. Its magnitude is $\\lvert K e^{-i\\omega\\tau} \\rvert = |K|$, which is constant with respect to frequency $\\omega$. Therefore, such a model can *never* account for the observed magnitude attenuation ($2.0 \\to 1.41 \\to 0.40$). The premise of the option is scientifically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The observed phase roll-off and magnitude attenuation are due to instrumentation phase bias and microphone gain roll-off; with proper calibration, the flame response is purely a delay with flat magnitude and linear phase -omega*tau.**\n\nWhile instrumentation artifacts are a real concern in experimental physics, the problem provides \"physically consistent measurements\" and asks for a conclusion about \"flame dynamics.\" This directs us to interpret the data as representative of the flame's behavior. The observed trends (magnitude roll-off and extra phase lag) are well-documented physical characteristics of flame response, explained by the finite time scales of flame surface dynamics. Attributing them solely to measurement error ignores established combustion physics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The phase roll-off arises from acoustic propagation ahead of the flame causing a net time advance; therefore one should model the flame with a negative delay to recover the measured trend in angle G(omega) without introducing additional dynamic elements.**\n\nThis option contains multiple errors. First, signal propagation (acoustic or convective) from the inlet to the flame causes a time *delay*, not a time *advance*. A time advance (or \"negative delay\") corresponds to a transfer function $e^{+i\\omega\\tau_{adv}}$, which would contribute a *positive* phase of $+\\omega\\tau_{adv}$. The data shows an increasingly *negative* phase, so a time advance would counteract, not explain, the observation. Second, just like the pure delay in option B, a pure time advance model has a constant magnitude of $1$ and cannot explain the observed magnitude attenuation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

The output heat release rate perturbation is therefore $q'(t) = q_{\\max}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\omega t)}{U_s}\\right)$.\n\nThe Flame Describing Function, $G(A, \\omega)$, is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of the output signal $q'(t)$ to the amplitude of the input signal $A$.\n\nFirst, we derive the FDF from first principles. The output signal $q'(t)$ is a periodic function with a period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$. It can be expanded into a Fourier series:\n$$q'(t) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left[ a_n \\cos(n\\omega t) + b_n \\sin(n\\omega t) \\right]$$\nThe Fourier coefficients are determined by the orthogonality of trigonometric functions. The function $u'(t) = A\\sin(\\omega t)$ is an odd function of $t$. The function $\\tanh(x)$ is an odd function of its argument $x$. Therefore, $q'(t) = f(u'(t))$ is an odd function of time $t$, since $f(-u') = q_{\\max}\\tanh(-u'/U_s) = -q_{\\max}\\tanh(u'/U_s) = -f(u')$. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval $[-T/2, T/2]$ is zero. The coefficients $a_n$ are calculated by integrating $q'(t)\\cos(n\\omega t)$, which is the product of an odd function ($q'(t)$) and an even function ($\\cos(n\\omega t)$), resulting in an odd integrand. Thus, all $a_n = 0$ for $n \\geq 0$.\n\nThe coefficients $b_n$ are given by:\n$$b_n = \\frac{2}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} q'(t) \\sin(n\\omega t) \\, dt$$\nThe integrand $q'(t)\\sin(n\\omega t)$ is the product of two odd functions, which is an even function, so the integral is generally non-zero. The fundamental component of the output corresponds to $n=1$, and its amplitude is $b_1$.\n$$b_1 = \\frac{2}{T} \\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} q_{\\max}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\omega t)}{U_s}\\right) \\sin(\\omega t) \\, dt$$\nSubstituting $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$, we get:\n$$b_1 = \\frac{\\omega}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi/\\omega}^{\\pi/\\omega} q_{\\max}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\omega t)}{U_s}\\right) \\sin(\\omega t) \\, dt$$\nTo show that the result is independent of $\\omega$ for this static nonlinearity, we perform a change of variables. Let $\\theta = \\omega t$, which implies $dt = d\\theta/\\omega$. The integration limits for $t$ from $-\\pi/\\omega$ to $\\pi/\\omega$ correspond to $\\theta$ from $-\\pi$ to $\\pi$.\n$$b_1 = \\frac{\\omega}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} q_{\\max}\\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\theta)}{U_s}\\right) \\sin(\\theta) \\, \\frac{d\\theta}{\\omega} = \\frac{q_{\\max}}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\theta)}{U_s}\\right) \\sin(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nAs demonstrated, the angular frequency $\\omega$ is eliminated from the expression for $b_1$, proving that the FDF for a static nonlinearity is independent of frequency. We can therefore denote it as $G(A)$.\nThe integrand $g(\\theta) = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\theta)}{U_s}\\right) \\sin(\\theta)$ is an even function of $\\theta$, since $g(-\\theta) = \\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(-\\theta)}{U_s}\\right) \\sin(-\\theta) = \\tanh\\left(-\\frac{A\\sin(\\theta)}{U_s}\\right)(-\\sin(\\theta)) = \\left(-\\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\theta)}{U_s}\\right)\\right)(-\\sin(\\theta)) = g(\\theta)$. Thus, we can simplify the integral:\n$$b_1 = \\frac{2q_{\\max}}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\theta)}{U_s}\\right) \\sin(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nThe FDF is $G(A) = b_1/A$. The final expression to be evaluated is:\n$$G(A) = \\frac{2q_{\\max}}{\\pi A} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\theta)}{U_s}\\right) \\sin(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\n\nNext, we analyze the asymptotic limits.\nFor the small-amplitude limit, $A \\to 0$, the argument of the $\\tanh$ function, $x = A\\sin(\\theta)/U_s$, is small. We use the Taylor expansion $\\tanh(x) \\approx x$.\n$$G(A) \\approx \\frac{2q_{\\max}}{\\pi A} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\left(\\frac{A\\sin(\\theta)}{U_s}\\right) \\sin(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{2q_{\\max}}{\\pi U_s} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nThe integral $\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\int_0^{\\pi} \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2} d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{\\theta}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{4}\\right]_0^{\\pi} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nThus, the small-amplitude limit is:\n$$\\lim_{A \\to 0} G(A) = \\frac{2q_{\\max}}{\\pi U_s} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\frac{q_{\\max}}{U_s}$$\nPhysically, this limit represents the linear gain of the system. For infinitesimally small perturbations, the nonlinear function $f(u')$ can be approximated by its tangent at the origin, $f(u') \\approx f'(0)u'$. The derivative is $f'(u') = \\frac{q_{\\max}}{U_s}\\mathrm{sech}^2(u'/U_s)$, and at $u'=0$, $f'(0) = q_{\\max}/U_s$. This linear gain is known as the Flame Transfer Function (FTF), and the FDF correctly reduces to the FTF in the linear regime.\n\nFor the large-amplitude asymptotic behavior, $A \\to \\infty$, the argument $x = A\\sin(\\theta)/U_s$ becomes very large for any $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$. The hyperbolic tangent approaches the signum function: $\\tanh(x) \\to \\mathrm{sgn}(x)$. In the integration interval $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin(\\theta) \\ge 0$, so $\\tanh(A\\sin(\\theta)/U_s) \\to 1$.\n$$G(A) \\approx \\frac{2q_{\\max}}{\\pi A} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} (1) \\sin(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nThe integral $\\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta = [-\\cos(\\theta)]_0^{\\pi} = 2$.\nSo, the large-amplitude asymptote is:\n$$G(A) \\sim \\frac{2q_{\\max}}{\\pi A} (2) = \\frac{4q_{\\max}}{\\pi A}$$\nPhysically, as the input amplitude $A$ becomes very large, the flame response saturates. The output $q'(t)$ approaches a square wave oscillating between $+q_{\\max}$ and $-q_{\\max}$. The amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of a square wave with peak value $q_{\\max}$ is $4q_{\\max}/\\pi$. Since the FDF is this amplitude divided by the input amplitude $A$, the gain must decay as $1/A$, which is confirmed by our derivation.\n\nFor numerical evaluation, we use the derived integral expression for $G(A)$. For Case 1 where $A=0$, we use the analytical small-amplitude limit $G(0) = q_{\\max}/U_s$. For Cases 2-5 where $A>0$, we compute the definite integral numerically using high-accuracy quadrature. The parameters $q_{\\max}$, $U_s$, and $A$ for each case are substituted into the formula for $G(A)$. The results are then rounded to six decimal places.",
