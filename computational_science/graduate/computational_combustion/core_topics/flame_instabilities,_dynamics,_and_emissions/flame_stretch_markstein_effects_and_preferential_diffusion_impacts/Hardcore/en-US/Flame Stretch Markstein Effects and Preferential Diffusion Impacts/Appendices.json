A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe primary task is to compute the Lewis number, $Le$, of the deficient reactant, which is stated to be hydrogen. The Lewis number is a dimensionless quantity defined as the ratio of the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$, to the mass diffusivity, $D$. For the deficient species (hydrogen), this is written as:\n$$\nLe = \\frac{\\alpha}{D}\n$$\nThe problem provides the mass diffusivity of hydrogen, $D = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$, is not given directly but can be calculated from its definition using the other provided properties: thermal conductivity ($\\lambda$), mass density ($\\rho$), and specific heat at constant pressure ($c_p$). The relationship is:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\rho c_p}\n$$\nWe are given the following values for the unburned mixture:\n$\\lambda = 0.055\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$\\rho = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$c_p = 1.20 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{0.055\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}{(0.95\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (1.20 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{0.055}{0.95 \\times 1200}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}} = \\frac{0.055}{1140}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}} \\approx 4.82456 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the Lewis number $Le$ using the calculated value of $\\alpha$ and the given value of $D$:\n$$\nLe = \\frac{\\alpha}{D} = \\frac{4.82456 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{8.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} \\approx 0.60307\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\nLe \\approx 0.6031\n$$\nThe second part of the problem asks for reasoning about the sign of the Markstein length, $L_M$. The Markstein length characterizes the sensitivity of the displacement speed, $S_d$, to flame stretch rate, $K$. A common convention is $S_d = S_L^0 - L_M K$, where $S_L^0$ is the unstretched burning velocity.\n\nThe reasoning is based on the principles of diffusive-thermal theory. We have found that the Lewis number of the deficient reactant (hydrogen) is $Le \\approx 0.6031$, which is significantly less than unity ($Le  1$). This implies that the mass diffusivity of the deficient reactant is greater than the thermal diffusivity of the mixture ($D > \\alpha$).\n\nFor an outwardly propagating spherical flame, the flame front is convex towards the unburned mixture. This geometry results in a positive flame stretch rate, $K > 0$. Flame stretch corresponds to a divergence of flow streamlines at the flame front.\n\nIn a region of positive curvature and positive stretch, diffusion processes are affected by the geometry. The diffusion of species towards the flame front is focused, while the diffusion of heat away from the flame front is defocused.\n-   When $Le  1$ ($D > \\alpha$), the preferential diffusion of the deficient reactant towards the flame front is more pronounced than the diffusion of heat away from it.\n-   This preferential focusing of the highly mobile, deficient reactant (hydrogen) leads to its enrichment at the curved flame front.\n-   An increase in the concentration of the deficient reactant at the reaction zone enhances the local chemical reaction rate, which in turn leads to a higher local flame temperature and a higher local displacement speed, $S_d$.\n-   Therefore, for a flame with $Le  1$, a positive stretch ($K > 0$) causes an increase in the displacement speed ($S_d > S_L^0$).\n\nRevisiting the relation $S_d = S_L^0 - L_M K$, we can rearrange it to $L_M = -\\frac{S_d - S_L^0}{K}$.\nSince we have established that for our case $S_d - S_L^0 > 0$ and $K > 0$, it follows that the term $\\frac{S_d - S_L^0}{K}$ is positive.\nTherefore, the Markstein length must be negative:\n$$\nL_M  0\n$$\nThis negative Markstein length signifies that the flame is strengthened by stretch, a characteristic feature of lean hydrogen-air flames and other mixtures with a light, deficient reactant, which are prone to diffusive-thermal instabilities.\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of the Lewis number.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem states that for weak stretch, the displacement speed $S_d$ deviates linearly from the planar, unstretched laminar burning velocity $S_L$. This relationship, known as the Markstein model, is expressed as:\n$$S_d = S_L - L_b K$$\nwhere $L_b$ is the Markstein length and $K$ is the stretch rate. The sign convention is chosen such that for a mixture with positive $L_b$, a positive stretch rate ($K  0$) reduces the burning velocity.\n\nThe stretch rate $K$ is given by:\n$$K = \\nabla_s\\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_t + S_d \\kappa$$\nThe problem specifies the assumption of negligible tangential strain, which means the surface divergence of the tangential velocity is zero:\n$$\\nabla_s\\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}_t \\approx 0$$\nWith this assumption, the stretch rate simplifies to being purely a function of curvature and displacement speed:\n$$K = S_d \\kappa$$\nThis indicates that the stretch is curvature-dominated.\n\nThe task is to find a first-order expression for $S_d$. In the weak stretch limit, the deviation of $S_d$ from $S_L$ is small. We can therefore approximate the stretch rate $K$ by replacing $S_d$ with its zeroth-order value, $S_L$:\n$$K \\approx S_L \\kappa$$\nSubstituting this first-order approximation for the stretch rate back into the linear model for displacement speed yields:\n$$S_d \\approx S_L - L_b (S_L \\kappa)$$\nThis expression can be rearranged as:\n$$S_d \\approx S_L(1 - L_b \\kappa)$$\nThis is the desired first-order expression for $S_d$. The problem also asks for identification of a coefficient with dimensions of diffusivity. We can write the expression as:\n$$S_d \\approx S_L - (S_L L_b) \\kappa$$\nThe term $S_L L_b$ has units of $(\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}) \\cdot \\mathrm{m} = \\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, which are the units of diffusivity. Let us define this effective \"Markstein diffusivity\" as $D_M = S_L L_b$. The expression is then $S_d \\approx S_L - D_M \\kappa$, which satisfies the problem's requirement.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for a locally spherical flame segment of radius $R$, convex to the unburned gas. The curvature for such a surface is given as:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{2}{R}$$\nThe sign is positive, consistent with the convention for a convex front. Substituting this into our first-order expression for $S_d$:\n$$S_d \\approx S_L\\left(1 - L_b \\frac{2}{R}\\right) = S_L\\left(1 - \\frac{2L_b}{R}\\right)$$\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n- $S_L = 0.400\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- $L_b = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $R = 5.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless stretch term $2L_b/R$:\n$$\\frac{2L_b}{R} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{5.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-3}}{5.00 \\times 10^{-2}} = 0.0400$$\nThis value is small compared to $1$, which self-consistently validates the use of the weak stretch approximation.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $S_d$:\n$$S_d = (0.400\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (1 - 0.0400) = (0.400\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (0.9600)$$\n$$S_d = 0.3840\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe result, $0.3840\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, is given to four significant figures as requested.\n\n### Discussion of Physical Effects\n\nThe derived relation $\\Delta S_d = S_d - S_L = -S_L L_b \\kappa$ shows how the flame speed is modified by local geometry and mixture properties.\n- **Sign of $\\kappa$ (Curvature):** As per the convention, $\\kappa  0$ for a flame front convex toward the unburned gas (like an expanding sphere), and $\\kappa  0$ for a front that is concave (like in a cusp or near a Bunsen burner rim).\n- **Sign of $L_b$ (Markstein Length):** The sign of $L_b$ is determined by the thermo-diffusive properties of the mixture, specifically the effective Lewis number ($Le$). The Lewis number is the ratio of thermal diffusivity to the mass diffusivity of the deficient reactant.\n  - If $Le  1$, the deficient reactant diffuses more slowly than heat. At a convex front ($\\kappa  0$), heat diffuses away from the flame tip faster than the reactant is supplied, weakening the reaction and slowing the flame. This corresponds to $L_b  0$. For a concave front ($\\kappa  0$), reactant is focused, strengthening the reaction and accelerating the flame.\n  - If $Le  1$, the deficient reactant diffuses faster than heat. At a convex front ($\\kappa  0$), the fast-diffusing reactant is focused toward the tip, enriching the mixture, strengthening the reaction, and accelerating the flame. This corresponds to $L_b  0$. At a concave front ($\\kappa  0$), the reactant diffuses away, weakening the reaction and slowing the flame.\n- **Conclusion:** For the given methane–air flame, we are told $L_b  0$. This is physically correct for lean or stoichiometric methane-air mixtures, which have an effective Lewis number greater than $1$. Since the flame is convex ($\\kappa  0$), the product $L_b \\kappa$ is positive. Therefore, the change in speed $\\Delta S_d = -S_L L_b \\kappa$ is negative. The flame is locally decelerated relative to its planar, unstretched speed $S_L$, which is consistent with our numerical result ($S_d = 0.3840\\ \\mathrm{m/s}  S_L = 0.400\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$).",
