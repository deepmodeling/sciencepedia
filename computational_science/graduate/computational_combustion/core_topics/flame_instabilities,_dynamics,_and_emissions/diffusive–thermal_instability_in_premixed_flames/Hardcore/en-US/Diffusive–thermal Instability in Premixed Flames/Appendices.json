In the preheat zone, the governing balances reduce to diffusion-dominated energy and species transport with negligible reaction, so that heat and the deficient reactant spread ahead of the front by thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ and mass diffusivity $D$, respectively. The Lewis number $Le$ of the deficient reactant is defined as the ratio of thermal to mass diffusivity.

The physical description of the diffusive-thermal instability mechanism and the provided values for thermal and mass diffusivity are consistent with established principles of combustion theory.\n\nThe first part of the task is to compute the Lewis number, $Le$. The problem statement defines the Lewis number as the ratio of the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$, to the mass diffusivity, $D$.\n$$Le = \\frac{\\alpha}{D}$$\nThe given values are $\\alpha = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and $D = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$.

Thus, $Le = 0.200$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine whether the flame is predisposed to diffusive–thermal instability, represented by the indicator variable $S$. This requires an analysis of the physical mechanism described.\n\nConsider a planar flame front that develops a small, convex perturbation (a \"protrusion\") that bulges into the unburnt gas mixture. The local burning rate, which determines the local flame speed, is a strong function of the flame temperature and the concentration of the reactants at the flame front. The stability of the front depends on how these local properties are affected by the perturbation. The transport of heat and the deficient reactant ahead of the flame front is governed by diffusion.\n\n$1$. **Heat Transport:** The flame front is at a high temperature (the adiabatic flame temperature) and the unburnt mixture is cold. Heat diffuses from the hot flame front into the cold reactants. At a convex protrusion, the area for heat diffusion into the unburnt gas is increased relative to a planar front. This is a \"defocusing\" effect, where heat spreads out divergently from the protrusion. This enhanced heat loss tends to lower the temperature at the protrusion, which in turn reduces the local reaction rate and flame speed. This effect acts to dampen the perturbation and stabilize the flame. The rate of this thermal smoothing process is governed by the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$.\n\n$2$. **Mass Transport:** The deficient reactant is consumed at the flame front. It diffuses from the unburnt mixture, where its concentration is higher, toward the flame front. At a convex protrusion, the iso-concentration lines in the unburnt mixture converge onto the tip. This \"focusing\" effect enhances the flux of the deficient reactant to the protrusion. An increased supply of the deficient reactant tends to increase the local reaction rate and flame speed. This effect acts to amplify the perturbation and destabilize the flame. The rate of this mass focusing process is governed by the mass diffusivity of the deficient reactant, $D$.\n\nThe predisposition to instability is determined by the competition between these two opposing effects. The dimensionless Lewis number, $Le = \\alpha/D$, directly compares the rate of thermal diffusion to the rate of mass diffusion.\n\n- If $Le  1$, then $\\alpha  D$. Thermal diffusion is more effective than mass diffusion. The stabilizing effect of heat defocusing dominates the destabilizing effect of reactant focusing. The temperature at the protrusion drops more significantly than the reactant concentration rises. The net effect is a reduction in the local burning rate, which smooths out the perturbation. The flame is stable.\n\n- If $Le  1$, then $\\alpha  D$. Mass diffusion is more effective than thermal diffusion. The destabilizing effect of reactant focusing dominates the stabilizing effect of heat defocusing. The reactant concentration at the protrusion increases more significantly than the temperature drops. The net effect is an increase in the local burning rate, which causes the perturbation to grow. The flame is predisposed to instability.\n\n- If $Le = 1$, then $\\alpha = D$. The two effects balance, and the flame is neutrally stable with respect to the diffusive-thermal mechanism.\n\nIn this problem, the calculated Lewis number is $Le = 0.2$. Since $Le  1$, mass diffusion is significantly faster than heat diffusion ($D = 5\\alpha$). Therefore, the destabilizing mechanism of reactant focusing is dominant. The flame is predisposed to diffusive–thermal instability.\n\nAccording to the problem definition, the indicator variable $S$ is $S=1$ for a predisposition to instability and $S=0$ for no predisposition. As the flame is predisposed to instability, $S=1$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}Le  S\\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting the calculated values gives $\\begin{pmatrix}0.200  1\\end{pmatrix}$.",

            "introduction": "Having established the condition for instability, we now explore one of its most important physical consequences: the modification of the local flame speed by curvature. This effect is quantified by the Markstein number, which links the flame's response to stretch, a measure of frontal area change. This practice challenges you to derive and apply the relationship between burning velocity, curvature, and the Markstein number for a spherically expanding flame, providing a concrete example of how diffusive-thermal effects alter flame dynamics .",

            "problem": "A spherically expanding, outwardly propagating premixed laminar flame is ignited in a quiescent, isothermal, constant-pressure environment. The unburned mixture has a planar laminar burning velocity $S_L^0$ and thermal flame thickness $\\delta_L$. In the thin-flame limit, diffusive–thermal effects are modeled to first order through the Markstein length $L_M$, with Markstein number defined by $Ma \\equiv L_M/\\delta_L$. The flame surface experiences stretch through its area change; the flame stretch rate is defined by $K \\equiv (1/A)\\,\\mathrm{d}A/\\mathrm{d}t$, where $A$ is the instantaneous flame surface area. For a sphere of radius $R$, the mean curvature is $\\kappa = 2/R$, and the area is $A = 4\\pi R^2$.\n\nStarting from conservation in a thin reaction zone and the definition of flame stretch, use the linear response of the local burning velocity to stretch through the Markstein length to derive the first-order curvature correction to the local burning velocity $S_L$ for a spherical flame in a quiescent environment.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained set of definitions, data, and assumptions consistent with standard combustion theory for analyzing diffusive–thermal effects in premixed flames. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution is tractable.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the first-order curvature correction to the local burning velocity, $S_L$, for a spherically expanding flame. The starting point is the linear relationship between the local burning velocity and the flame stretch rate, $K$, which is mediated by the Markstein length, $L_M$:\n$$\nS_L - S_L^0 = -L_M K\n$$\nHere, $S_L^0$ is the planar laminar burning velocity. Flame stretch, $K$, is defined as the fractional rate of change of the flame surface area, $A$: $K \\equiv \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dA}{dt}$.\n\nThe problem states to consider a spherical flame of radius $R$ and to assume that the only source of stretch is curvature. The general expression for stretch includes contributions from both fluid dynamic strain and flame propagation normal to a curved surface. The statement \"the only source of stretch is curvature\" implies a simplification where the stretch rate is directly related to the propagation and curvature. For a spherical flame element, the stretch rate can be approximated by accounting for the flame's own propagation into a curved geometry. A common first-order approximation for the stretch rate in this context is to relate it to the curvature $\\kappa$ and the unperturbed burning velocity $S_L^0$. The mean curvature of a sphere is $\\kappa = 2/R$. The stretch rate is approximated as:\n$$\nK \\approx S_L^0 \\kappa = \\frac{2S_L^0}{R}\n$$\nThis approximation linearizes the problem by evaluating the stretch rate using the zeroth-order velocity, $S_L^0$, which is consistent with a first-order analysis. Substituting this expression for $K$ into the linear response equation yields:\n$$\nS_L - S_L^0 \\approx -L_M \\left( \\frac{2S_L^0}{R} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $S_L$:\n$$\nS_L \\approx S_L^0 - \\frac{2L_M S_L^0}{R}\n$$\nFactoring out $S_L^0$ gives the first-order correction:\n$$\nS_L \\approx S_L^0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{2L_M}{R} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the definition of mean curvature $\\kappa = 2/R$, this can be written as:\n$$\nS_L \\approx S_L^0 (1 - L_M \\kappa)\n$$\nThis expression represents the first-order curvature correction to the local burning velocity.\n\nNext, we evaluate $S_L$ for the given data:\n- Planar laminar burning velocity: $S_L^0 = 0.35\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Thermal flame thickness: $\\delta_L = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Markstein number: $Ma = -2.0$\n- Flame radius: $R = 10\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Markstein length $L_M$ from the Markstein number $Ma \\equiv L_M/\\delta_L$:\n$$\nL_M = Ma \\cdot \\delta_L = (-2.0) \\times (0.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}) = -0.4 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the mean curvature $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\kappa = \\frac{2}{R} = \\frac{2}{10 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 200\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, substitute these values into the derived expression for $S_L$:\n$$\nS_L \\approx S_L^0 (1 - L_M \\kappa) = (0.35\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times \\left(1 - (-0.4 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (200\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-1})\\right)\n$$\n$$\nS_L \\approx 0.35 \\times (1 - (-0.08))\n$$\n$$\nS_L \\approx 0.35 \\times (1 + 0.08)\n$$\n$$\nS_L \\approx 0.35 \\times 1.08 = 0.378\\ \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the local burning velocity is $S_L = 0.378\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nFinally, we determine if the curvature-induced correction instantaneously increases or decreases the local normal acceleration of the flame front relative to the planar case.\n\nThe planar case corresponds to $R \\to \\infty$, where $\\kappa=0$ and $S_L = S_L^0$. Our calculation for the curved flame at the given radius shows $S_L = 0.378\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, while $S_L^0 = 0.35\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$. Since $S_L  S_L^0$, the local burning velocity is increased by the curvature effect. An increase in the flame's propagation speed relative to the unburned gas constitutes a positive normal acceleration of the flame front compared to the planar case. Therefore, the correction instantaneously **increases** the local normal acceleration.\n\nThe justification for this sign choice lies in the physics of diffusive-thermal instability. The Markstein number $Ma$ is negative ($Ma = -2.0$), which typically corresponds to a mixture with an effective Lewis number ($Le$) less than one. For an outwardly propagating spherical flame, the front is convex towards the unburned reactants ($\\kappa  0$).\n1.  **Heat Diffusion**: Heat diffuses from the compact reaction zone into the larger volume of the unburned mixture. This defocusing of thermal energy tends to lower the flame temperature and thus decrease $S_L$.\n2.  **Mass Diffusion**: For $Le  1$, the deficient reactant is more mobile than heat. This reactant diffuses from the unburned mixture toward the reaction zone. Due to the convex curvature, the reactant flux is focused onto a smaller area, increasing its concentration at the flame front. This effect tends to raise the flame temperature and increase $S_L$.\n\nSince $Ma  0$, the reactant-focusing effect (destabilizing) dominates the heat-defocusing effect (stabilizing). The net result is an increase in the local burning velocity, $S_L  S_L^0$. This increase in velocity signifies a positive acceleration relative to the constant-velocity planar flame, promoting the growth of the outward bulge and indicating an unstable configuration. This is consistent with our calculation where the correction term, $-L_M \\kappa$, is positive because $L_M$ and $\\kappa$ have opposite signs ($L_M  0$, $\\kappa  0$).",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of definitions, parameters, and constraints to perform the required calculations for setting up a Direct Numerical Simulation of a premixed flame. The underlying physical model, based on a linearized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky-type equation for diffusive-thermal instability, and the numerical constraints for spatial resolution and temporal stability are standard and correct within the field of computational combustion. All provided data are physically realistic and dimensionally consistent.\n\nThe solution proceeds by systematically calculating the required simulation parameters based on the provided physical and numerical principles. The procedure is as follows for each test case.\n\nFirst, we determine the properties of the most unstable mode of the diffusive-thermal instability. The dimensionless growth rate $\\sigma(\\hat{k})$ of a perturbation with dimensionless wavenumber $\\hat{k}$ is given by $\\sigma(\\hat{k}) = a\\, \\hat{k}^2 - b\\, \\hat{k}^4$. The coefficient $a$ represents the strength of the destabilizing mechanism, which is proportional to the deviation of the Lewis number $Le$ from unity. We use the specified approximation $a = 1 - Le$. The coefficient $b$ represents a high-wavenumber stabilizing effect. To find the fastest-growing mode, we find the maximum of $\\sigma(\\hat{k})$ by setting its derivative with respect to $\\hat{k}$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{d\\hat{k}} = 2a\\hat{k} - 4b\\hat{k}^3 = 0\n$$\nThis yields the dimensionless wavenumber of the most unstable mode, $\\hat{k}_m = \\sqrt{a / (2b)}$. The corresponding dimensionless wavelength is $\\hat{\\lambda}_m = 2\\pi / \\hat{k}_m = 2\\pi \\sqrt{2b / a}$. The physical wavelength, $\\lambda_m$, is found by scaling with the laminar flame thermal thickness $\\delta_L$:\n$$\n\\lambda_m = \\hat{\\lambda}_m \\, \\delta_L = 2\\pi \\delta_L \\sqrt{\\frac{2b}{a}}\n$$\nWe compute a nominal wavelength $\\lambda_m$ using the nominal coefficient $b_{\\text{nom}} = 0.10$. To bracket the uncertainty in this prediction, we also compute minimum and maximum possible wavelengths using the provided bounds $b_{\\min} = 0.05$ and $b_{\\max} = 0.20$.\n\nSecond, we determine the necessary spatial resolution. A numerical simulation must resolve all relevant physical length scales. In this problem, there are two primary scales: the flame's intrinsic thermal thickness, $\\delta_L$, and the characteristic wavelength of the instability, $\\lambda_m$. The problem requires resolving the former with at least $N_\\delta$ grid points and the latter with at least $N_\\lambda$ grid points. This imposes two upper bounds on the grid spacing $\\Delta x$:\n$$\n\\Delta x \\le \\frac{\\delta_L}{N_\\delta} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta x \\le \\frac{\\lambda_m}{N_\\lambda}\n$$\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously while using the most computationally efficient (i.e., largest) grid spacing possible, we choose $\\Delta x$ to be the minimum of these two upper bounds:\n$$\n\\Delta x = \\min\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_m}{N_\\lambda}, \\frac{\\delta_L}{N_\\delta}\\right)\n$$\nAll subsequent calculations for domain size and grid count are based on this value of $\\Delta x$. Note that the nominal wavelength $\\lambda_m$ (calculated with $b_{\\text{nom}}$) is used for this step.\n\nThird, we define the computational domain size and the corresponding grid dimensions. To study the interaction of instability cells, the domain must be large enough to contain multiple wavelengths. The domain lengths $L_x$ and $L_y$ are set to contain $N_x^{\\text{cells}}$ and $N_y^{\\text{cells}}$ nominal wavelengths, respectively:\n$$\nL_x = N_x^{\\text{cells}} \\cdot \\lambda_m \\quad \\text{and} \\quad L_y = N_y^{\\text{cells}} \\cdot \\lambda_m\n$$\nGiven the domain sizes and the grid spacing $\\Delta x$, the number of grid points required in each direction, $N_x$ and $N_y$, is determined by dividing the domain length by the grid spacing. We use the ceiling function, $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$, to ensure the grid covers the entire domain:\n$$\nN_x = \\left\\lceil \\frac{L_x}{\\Delta x} \\right\\rceil \\quad \\text{and} \\quad N_y = \\left\\lceil \\frac{L_y}{\\Delta x} \\right\\rceil\n$$\n\nFourth, we determine the stable time step size for explicit time integration. The governing partial differential equation contains second-order spatial derivatives (diffusion/Laplacian terms) which, when discretized explicitly (e.g., using a forward Euler scheme with central differences), are subject to a stability constraint. For a 2D diffusion equation $\\partial_t u = D_{eff} (\\partial_{xx}u + \\partial_{yy}u)$ with grid spacing $\\Delta x = \\Delta y$, the stability limit is $\\Delta t \\le \\Delta x^2 / (4 D_{eff})$. The most stringent constraint arises from the fastest diffusion process in the system. The two relevant diffusivities are the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha_T$, and the mass diffusivity of the limiting reactant, $D$. These are related by the Lewis number, $D = \\alpha_T / Le$. The effective maximum diffusivity is therefore $D_{\\max} = \\max(\\alpha_T, D)$. Since the problem specifies $Le  1$, we have $D  \\alpha_T$, and thus $D_{\\max} = D = \\alpha_T / Le$. The time step $\\Delta t$ is then calculated using the stability condition, incorporating the specified safety factor:\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\text{safety} \\times \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{4 D_{\\max}}\n$$\nFor this calculation, it is crucial to maintain consistent units. Since $\\alpha_T$ is given in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, the grid spacing $\\Delta x$, given in $\\mathrm{mm}$, must be converted to meters. The resulting $\\Delta t$ will be in seconds.",
