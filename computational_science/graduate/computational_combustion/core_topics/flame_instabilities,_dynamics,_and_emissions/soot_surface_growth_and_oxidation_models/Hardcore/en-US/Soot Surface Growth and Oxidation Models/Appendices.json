If $R_{\\text{net}, i} = 0$, then $t_{\\text{cross}} = t_i$. Otherwise, assuming linear variation on the interval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$, we solve\n$$\nR_{\\text{net}}(t) \\approx R_{\\text{net}, i} + \\frac{t - t_i}{\\Delta t} \\big(R_{\\text{net}, i+1} - R_{\\text{net}, i}\\big),\n$$\nfor $R_{\\text{net}}(t_{\\text{cross}}) = 0$, yielding\n$$\nt_{\\text{cross}} = t_i - \\Delta t \\, \\frac{R_{\\text{net}, i}}{R_{\\text{net}, i+1} - R_{\\text{net}, i}}.\n$$\nIf no sign change occurs over the entire interval, we return $-1.0$.\n\nAlgorithmic design steps integrated with principles:\n- Use the spherical geometry relation $A(m)$ to couple kinetics to particle size consistently with mass conservation.\n- Implement Arrhenius temperature dependence to account for activation barriers in both HACA growth and oxygen oxidation.\n- Apply piecewise species histories to represent the residence-time environment switch and avoid unphysical instantaneous concentration discontinuities by using exponential ramps.\n- Use explicit Euler integration with a small $\\Delta t$ to resolve fast kinetics while maintaining code simplicity; clamp $m(t)$ to a small positive $\\epsilon$ to ensure nonnegative mass.\n- Use linear interpolation for sub-time-step precision in estimating $t_{\\text{cross}}$, honoring the continuous nature of $R_{\\text{net}}(t)$ between discrete samples.\n\nWith the specified test suite parameter values and units, the program computes $R_{\\text{net}}(t)$ trajectories and returns the earliest crossover time for each case. The results are printed as a single line in the required format, with times in seconds and rounded to six decimal places.",
