The problem provides specific idealizations for these activities: the activity of a surface species is approximated by its fractional coverage, and the activity of a dilute gas-phase species is approximated by its molar concentration.\n\nFirst, we formulate the per-site rate for the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism, denoted as $r_{\\mathrm{LH}}$.
