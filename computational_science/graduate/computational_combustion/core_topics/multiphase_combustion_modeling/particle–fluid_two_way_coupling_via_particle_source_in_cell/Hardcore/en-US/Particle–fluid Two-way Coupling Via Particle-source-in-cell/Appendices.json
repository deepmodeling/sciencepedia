The Particle-Source-in-Cell (PSI-CELL) method and the Cloud-In-Cell (CIC) scheme are standard tools in computational fluid dynamics for particle-laden flows. The constraints listed—positivity, partition of unity, and affine completeness (first-moment conservation)—are the defining properties of such second-order accurate interpolation schemes. The problem is self-contained, with all requisite information provided. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nSolution Derivation:\nThe construction begins in one dimension, along the $x$-coordinate. The local coordinate is $\\xi \\in [0,1]$. The two vertices of the one-dimensional cell segment are at local coordinates $0$ and $1$. Let the corresponding weights be $W_{0}(\\xi)$ and $W_{1}(\\xi)$. The constraints, reduced to one dimension, are:\n$1$. Positivity: $W_m(\\xi) \\ge 0$ for $m \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $\\xi \\in [0,1]$.\n$2$. Partition of unity (zeroth-order moment conservation): $W_{0}(\\xi) + W_{1}(\\xi) = 1$. This ensures that a constant field is reproduced exactly, preserving conserved quantities.\n$3$. Affine completeness (first-order moment conservation): The weighted average of the vertex positions must equal the particle's position. In local coordinates, this is $0 \\cdot W_{0}(\\xi) + 1 \\cdot W_{1}(\\xi) = \\xi$.\n\nFrom the first-order moment condition, we directly obtain $W_{1}(\\xi) = \\xi$.\nSubstituting this into the partition of unity condition gives $W_{0}(\\xi) + \\xi = 1$, which yields $W_{0}(\\xi) = 1 - \\xi$.\nThese functions, $W_{0}(\\xi) = 1 - \\xi$ and $W_{1}(\\xi) = \\xi$, are piecewise-linear and satisfy the positivity constraint for $\\xi \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe problem states that the three-dimensional kernel is a tensor product of the one-dimensional functions. The weight $w_{mnp}$ at the vertex with local Eucledian coordinate offset $(m, n, p)$ from the cell origin, where $m, n, p \\in \\{0,1\\}$, is given by the product of the corresponding one-dimensional weights for each direction:\n$$w_{mnp}(\\xi, \\eta, \\zeta) = W_m(\\xi) W_n(\\eta) W_p(\\zeta)$$\nAnalogous to the $x$-direction, the one-dimensional weights for the $y$ and $z$ directions are:\n$W_0(\\eta) = 1-\\eta$, $W_1(\\eta) = \\eta$\n$W_0(\\zeta) = 1-\\zeta$, $W_1(\\zeta) = \\zeta$\n\nTherefore, the eight weights for the vertices of the cubic cell are given by the trilinear interpolation functions:\n$w_{000} = W_0(\\xi)W_0(\\eta)W_0(\\zeta) = (1-\\xi)(1-\\eta)(1-\\zeta)$\n$w_{100} = W_1(\\xi)W_0(\\eta)W_0(\\zeta) = \\xi(1-\\eta)(1-\\zeta)$\n$w_{010} = W_0(\\xi)W_1(\\eta)W_0(\\zeta) = (1-\\xi)\\eta(1-\\zeta)$\n$w_{001} = W_0(\\xi)W_0(\\eta)W_1(\\zeta) = (1-\\xi)(1-\\eta)\\zeta$\n$w_{110} = W_1(\\xi)W_1(\\eta)W_0(\\zeta) = \\xi\\eta(1-\\zeta)$\n$w_{101} = W_1(\\xi)W_0(\\eta)W_1(\\zeta) = \\xi(1-\\eta)\\zeta$\n$w_{011} = W_0(\\xi)W_1(\\eta)W_1(\\zeta) = (1-\\xi)\\eta\\zeta$\n$w_{111} = W_1(\\xi)W_1(\\eta)W_1(\\zeta) = \\xi\\eta\\zeta$\n\nThese are the expressions for the eight CIC weights in terms of the local coordinates $\\xi$, $\\eta$, and $\\zeta$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values for the specific case provided. The particle position is given as $(x_{p}, y_{p}, z_{p}) = (x_{0} + 0.3 \\Delta x, y_{0} + 0.7 \\Delta y, z_{0} + 0.4 \\Delta z)$.

Assume free space (no boundaries) so that the integrals are taken over $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nUsing only fundamental conservation principles and the definitions above, determine the exact symbolic expression for the normalization constant $C$ that enforces the conservation constraint. Then, justify whether the first-moment condition is satisfied by this choice of kernel. Report $C$ symbolically in terms of $R$ and universal constants. Do not substitute numerical values or perform rounding. The unit of $C$ is the reciprocal of volume (for example, $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ if $R$ is in meters). The final answer must be a single closed-form expression for $C$.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a standard procedure in computational fluid dynamics for coupling Lagrangian particles to an Eulerian fluid grid, specifically the normalization of a projection kernel. All necessary information is provided to determine the constant $C$ and verify the moment conditions. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires two tasks: first, to determine the normalization constant $C$ for the given kernel function $w(\\mathbf{r})$ using the conservation (zeroth moment) constraint; second, to verify if the resulting kernel satisfies the no-spurious-torque (first moment) constraint.\n\nThe kernel function is given by:\n$$\nw(\\mathbf{r}) =\n\\begin{cases}\nC \\left( 1 - \\dfrac{\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|^{2}}{R^{2}} \\right)^{2}, & \\text{if } \\|\\mathbf{r}\\| \\le R, \\\\\n0, & \\text{if } \\|\\mathbf{r}\\| > R,\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_{p}$.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the normalization constant $C$**\n\nThe conservation constraint requires that the integral of the kernel over all space equals $1$.\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}V = 1\n$$\nSince $w(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$ for $\\|\\mathbf{r}\\| > R$, the integral is non-zero only within a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin of the $\\mathbf{r}$ coordinate system (i.e., at the particle's location $\\mathbf{x}_p$).\n$$\n\\int_{\\|\\mathbf{r}\\| \\le R} C \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|^{2}}{R^{2}} \\right)^{2} \\,\\mathrm{d}V = 1\n$$\nThe integrand is spherically symmetric, making it highly advantageous to evaluate the integral in spherical coordinates. Let $r = \\|\\mathbf{r}\\|$. The volume element is $\\mathrm{d}V = r^{2} \\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}r \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi$, where $r \\in [0, R]$, $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\nC \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{R} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}} \\right)^{2} r^{2} \\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}r \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi = 1\n$$\nThe integrand is separable. We can separate the radial and angular parts:\n$$\nC \\left( \\int_{0}^{R} r^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}} \\right)^{2} \\,\\mathrm{d}r \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\mathrm{d}\\phi \\right) = 1\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the angular integrals:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\mathrm{d}\\phi = [\\phi]_{0}^{2\\pi} = 2\\pi\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin\\theta \\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta = [-\\cos\\theta]_{0}^{\\pi} = -(\\cos\\pi - \\cos0) = -(-1 - 1) = 2\n$$\nThe product of the angular integrals represents the total solid angle of a sphere, which is $4\\pi$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the radial integral, $I_{r}$:\n$$\nI_{r} = \\int_{0}^{R} r^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{r^{2}}{R^{2}} \\right)^{2} \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nExpand the squared term:\n$$\nI_{r} = \\int_{0}^{R} r^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{2r^{2}}{R^{2}} + \\frac{r^{4}}{R^{4}} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}r = \\int_{0}^{R} \\left( r^{2} - \\frac{2r^{4}}{R^{2}} + \\frac{r^{6}}{R^{4}} \\right) \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nIntegrate term by term with respect to $r$:\n$$\nI_{r} = \\left[ \\frac{r^{3}}{3} - \\frac{2r^{5}}{5R^{2}} + \\frac{r^{7}}{7R^{4}} \\right]_{0}^{R}\n$$\nEvaluate at the limits of integration:\n$$\nI_{r} = \\left( \\frac{R^{3}}{3} - \\frac{2R^{5}}{5R^{2}} + \\frac{R^{7}}{7R^{4}} \\right) - (0) = \\frac{R^{3}}{3} - \\frac{2R^{3}}{5} + \\frac{R^{3}}{7}\n$$\nFind a common denominator, which is $3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 105$:\n$$\nI_{r} = R^{3} \\left( \\frac{35}{105} - \\frac{42}{105} + \\frac{15}{105} \\right) = R^{3} \\left( \\frac{35 - 42 + 15}{105} \\right) = R^{3} \\left( \\frac{8}{105} \\right) = \\frac{8R^{3}}{105}\n$$\nNow, substitute the results of the radial and angular integrals back into the conservation equation:\n$$\nC \\cdot \\left( \\frac{8R^{3}}{105} \\right) \\cdot (4\\pi) = 1\n$$\n$$\nC \\cdot \\frac{32\\pi R^{3}}{105} = 1\n$$\nSolving for $C$ gives the final symbolic expression:\n$$\nC = \\frac{105}{32\\pi R^{3}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Verification of the first moment condition**\n\nThe first moment condition for preventing spurious torque is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} \\mathbf{r}\\, w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}V = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis is a vector integral. It is zero if and only if each of its components is zero. Let $\\mathbf{r} = x\\mathbf{e}_x + y\\mathbf{e}_y + z\\mathbf{e}_z$. We must show that $\\int x\\, w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}V = 0$, $\\int y\\, w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}V = 0$, and $\\int z\\, w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}V = 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the $x$-component integral:\n$$\nI_x = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} x\\, w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}V = \\iiint_{\\|\\mathbf{r}\\| \\le R} x\\, w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}z\n$$\nThe kernel function $w(\\mathbf{r})$ depends only on $\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|^{2} = x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}$. This means $w(\\mathbf{r})$ is an even function with respect to each of its spatial coordinates. Specifically, $w(x, y, z) = w(-x, y, z)$.\nThe integrand is the product $f(x, y, z) = x \\cdot w(x, y, z)$. Let's check its parity with respect to the variable $x$:\n$$\nf(-x, y, z) = (-x) \\cdot w(-x, y, z) = (-x) \\cdot w(x, y, z) = -f(x, y, z)\n$$\nThe integrand $x\\, w(\\mathbf{r})$ is an odd function with respect to $x$. The domain of integration is a sphere of radius $R$ centered at the origin, which is a symmetric domain with respect to the plane $x=0$. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval (or domain) is always zero. Therefore, $I_x=0$.\n\nBy identical reasoning, the integrand $y\\, w(\\mathbf{r})$ is an odd function of $y$, and the integrand $z\\, w(\\mathbf{r})$ is an odd function of $z$. Since the spherical domain is also symmetric with respect to the $y=0$ and $z=0$ planes, their respective integrals are also zero.\n$$\nI_y = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} y\\, w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}V = 0\n$$\n$$\nI_z = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} z\\, w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}V = 0\n$$\nThus, the vector integral is the zero vector:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{3}} \\mathbf{r}\\, w(\\mathbf{r}) \\,\\mathrm{d}V = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis confirms that the first-moment condition is satisfied for any spherically symmetric kernel, including the specific form given in the problem, regardless of the value of the normalization constant $C$. The spherical symmetry of the kernel is the key property that guarantees the absence of spurious self-induced torque.\nThe value of $C$ derived ensures conservation, and the form of the kernel ensures the torque condition is met.",
