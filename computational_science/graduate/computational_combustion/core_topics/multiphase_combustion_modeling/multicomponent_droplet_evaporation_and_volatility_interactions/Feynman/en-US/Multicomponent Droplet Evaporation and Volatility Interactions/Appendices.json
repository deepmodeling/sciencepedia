            "problem": "A computational combustion code simulates the evaporation of a ternary liquid droplet ($i=1,2,3$) composed of species with molar masses $M_i$ and liquid density $\\rho_{\\ell}$. The surrounding gas is an ideal mixture at pressure $p$ and temperature $T$. The code requires, at each time step, consistent conversions between gas-phase mass fractions $Y_i^{g}$, gas-phase mole fractions $x_i^{g}$, gas-phase number densities $n_i^{g}$, liquid-phase mass fractions $Y_i^{\\ell}$, liquid-phase mole fractions $x_i^{\\ell}$, and liquid-phase number densities $n_i^{\\ell}$. The evaporation submodels use gas-phase number densities to compute interfacial diffusive fluxes and liquid-phase mole fractions to evaluate non-ideal activity corrections; the mass sources returned to the gas solver are based on mass fractions. The implementation team suspects their current conversion formulas are causing order-of-magnitude errors.\n\nAssume the following fundamental laws and definitions hold:\n- Ideal gas law in molecular form: $p V = N k_{B} T$, where $N$ is the number of molecules, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n- Ideal gas law in molar form: $p V = n_{\\text{mol}} R_{u} T$, where $n_{\\text{mol}}$ is the number of moles and $R_{u}$ is the Universal Gas Constant.\n- Mass fraction definition: $Y_{i} \\equiv \\rho_{i} / \\rho$, where $\\rho_{i}$ and $\\rho$ are the component and mixture mass densities.\n- Mole fraction definition: $x_{i} \\equiv n_{i} / n$, where $n_{i}$ and $n$ are the component and mixture number densities (molecules per unit volume).\n- Molar mass definition: $M_{i}$ is the mass per mole of species $i$, and $N_{A}$ is Avogadro’s number, relating molecules to moles by $n_{\\text{mol}} = n / N_{A}$.\n- For the liquid mixture, treat it as an ideal solution with known mixture density $\\rho_{\\ell}$, and let the mixture-average molar mass be $\\bar{M}_{\\ell} \\equiv \\sum_{j} x_{j}^{\\ell} M_{j}$.\n\nWhich option correctly states the required conversion formulas for both phases and explains why unit consistency is critical in multicomponent evaporation codes?\n\nA. For either phase, the conversion between mass and mole fractions is $x_{i} = \\dfrac{Y_{i}}{M_{i}}\\Big/\\sum_{j}\\dfrac{Y_{j}}{M_{j}}$ and $Y_{i} = \\dfrac{x_{i} M_{i}}{\\sum_{j} x_{j} M_{j}}$.

Unit consistency is critical because $k_{B}$ relates energy per molecule and $R_{u}$ per mole; using $R_{u}$ without $N_{A}$ mislabels molar densities as number densities, and mixing $\\mathrm{kg/mol}$ with $\\mathrm{kg/kmol}$ or inconsistent $\\rho$ units propagates factor-of-$N_{A}$ or $10^{3}$ errors into interfacial fluxes.\n\nB.

Unit consistency is secondary because ratios cancel common units; any inconsistent choice of $\\mathrm{kg/mol}$ or $\\mathrm{kg/kmol}$ will not affect $n_{i}^{g}$ or $n_{i}^{\\ell}$, since both are proportional to fractions.\n\nC.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and its internal definitions are consistent under a standard interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Conversion Formulas\n\nFirst, we derive the general relationships between mass fraction ($Y_i$) and mole fraction ($x_i$). These are valid for any phase (liquid or gas). Let $C_i$ be the molar concentration of species $i$ (moles/volume) and $\\rho_i$ be its partial mass density (mass/volume). They are related by $\\rho_i = C_i M_i$.\nThe total molar concentration is $C = \\sum_j C_j$ and the total mass density is $\\rho = \\sum_j \\rho_j$.\n\n1.  **From Mass Fraction ($Y_i$) to Mole Fraction ($x_i$):**\n    By definition, $x_i = C_i / C$.\n    We can write $C_i = \\rho_i / M_i$. The total molar concentration is $C = \\sum_j C_j = \\sum_j (\\rho_j / M_j)$.\n    Substituting these into the definition of $x_i$:\n    $$x_i = \\frac{\\rho_i / M_i}{\\sum_j (\\rho_j / M_j)}$$\n    Dividing the numerator and denominator by the total mass density $\\rho$ gives:\n    $$x_i = \\frac{(\\rho_i / \\rho) / M_i}{\\sum_j ((\\rho_j / \\rho) / M_j)} = \\frac{Y_i / M_i}{\\sum_j (Y_j / M_j)}$$\n\n2.  **From Mole Fraction ($x_i$) to Mass Fraction ($Y_i$):**\n    By definition, $Y_i = \\rho_i / \\rho$.\n    We can write $\\rho_i = C_i M_i$. The total mass density is $\\rho = \\sum_j \\rho_j = \\sum_j C_j M_j$.\n    Substituting these into the definition of $Y_i$:\n    $$Y_i = \\frac{C_i M_i}{\\sum_j C_j M_j}$$\n    Dividing the numerator and denominator by the total molar concentration $C$ gives:\n    $$Y_i = \\frac{(C_i / C) M_i}{\\sum_j ((C_j / C) M_j)} = \\frac{x_i M_i}{\\sum_j x_j M_j}$$\n    The denominator, $\\sum_j x_j M_j$, is the definition of the mixture-average molar mass, $\\bar{M}$.\n\nNext, we derive the formulas for number densities ($n_i$).\n\n3.  **Gas-Phase Number Density ($n_i^g$):**\n    The ideal gas law in molecular form is $p V = N k_B T$. The total number density of molecules is $n^g = N/V = p / (k_B T)$.\n    The mole fraction is defined in the problem as $x_i^g = n_i^g / n^g$.\n    Therefore, the species number density is $n_i^g = x_i^g n^g = x_i^g \\frac{p}{k_B T}$.\n    Using Dalton's Law of partial pressures, $p_i = x_i^g p$, this can be rewritten as:\n    $$n_i^g = \\frac{p_i}{k_B T}$$\n    We can also relate this to the molar formulation. The universal gas constant $R_u$ and Boltzmann constant $k_B$ are related by $R_u = N_A k_B$.\n    $$n_i^g = \\frac{p_i}{k_B T} = \\frac{p_i}{(R_u / N_A) T} = N_A \\frac{p_i}{R_u T}$$\n    Here, $p_i / (R_u T)$ is the molar concentration $C_i^g$. This confirms that number density $n_i^g$ is Avogadro's number $N_A$ times the molar concentration $C_i^g$.\n\n4.  **Liquid-Phase Number Density ($n_i^\\ell$):**\n    For the liquid, we start with the mass fraction $Y_i^\\ell = \\rho_i^\\ell / \\rho_\\ell$, where $\\rho_i^\\ell$ is the partial mass density of species $i$ in the liquid mixture and $\\rho_\\ell$ is the mixture's total density.\n    The molar concentration of species $i$ is $C_i^\\ell = \\rho_i^\\ell / M_i$.\n    Substituting $\\rho_i^\\ell = \\rho_\\ell Y_i^\\ell$, we get $C_i^\\ell = (\\rho_\\ell Y_i^\\ell) / M_i$.\n    The number density is $n_i^\\ell = N_A C_i^\\ell$.\n    $$n_i^\\ell = N_A \\frac{\\rho_\\ell Y_i^\\ell}{M_i}$$\n    We can also express this in terms of the liquid mole fraction, $x_i^\\ell$. Using the previously derived relation $Y_i^\\ell = (x_i^\\ell M_i) / \\bar{M}_\\ell$, where $\\bar{M}_\\ell = \\sum_j x_j^\\ell M_j$:\n    $$n_i^\\ell = N_A \\frac{\\rho_\\ell}{M_i} \\left( \\frac{x_i^\\ell M_i}{\\bar{M}_\\ell} \\right) = \\frac{\\rho_\\ell N_A}{\\bar{M}_\\ell} x_i^\\ell$$\n\n5.  **Unit Consistency**:\n    The derivations reveal several points where unit errors can arise.\n    - Using $R_u$ in a formula for number density without the $N_A$ factor (e.g., $p_i / (R_u T)$) will yield a molar density, which is incorrect by a factor of $N_A \\approx 6.022 \\times 10^{23}$.\n    - In sums like $\\sum_j (Y_j / M_j)$, all molar masses $M_j$ must have consistent units (e.g., all in $\\text{kg/mol}$ or all in $\\text{g/mol}$). Mixing units, for instance using $\\text{g/mol}$ (numerically equivalent to $\\text{kg/kmol}$) with $\\text{kg/mol}$, will introduce factors of $1000$ and corrupt the mole fraction calculation.\n    - All densities ($\\rho$, $\\rho_\\ell$) and molar masses ($M_i$) must use a consistent mass unit (e.g., $\\text{kg}$).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For either phase, the conversion between mass and mole fractions is $x_{i} = \\dfrac{Y_{i}}{M_{i}}\\Big/\\sum_{j}\\dfrac{Y_{j}}{M_{j}}$ and $Y_{i} = \\dfrac{x_{i} M_{i}}{\\sum_{j} x_{j} M_{j}}$. In the gas phase, $p_{i} = x_{i}^{g} p$ and $n_{i}^{g} = \\dfrac{p_{i}}{k_{B} T} = N_{A} \\dfrac{p_{i}}{R_{u} T}$. In the liquid phase, $n_{i}^{\\ell} = \\dfrac{\\rho_{\\ell} Y_{i}^{\\ell} N_{A}}{M_{i}} = \\dfrac{\\rho_{\\ell} N_{A}}{\\bar{M}_{\\ell}} x_{i}^{\\ell}$. Unit consistency is critical because $k_{B}$ relates energy per molecule and $R_{u}$ per mole; using $R_{u}$ without $N_{A}$ mislabels molar densities as number densities, and mixing $\\mathrm{kg/mol}$ with $\\mathrm{kg/kmol}$ or inconsistent $\\rho$ units propagates factor-of-$N_{A}$ or $10^{3}$ errors into interfacial fluxes.**\n- The mass/mole fraction conversions match the derived formulas (1) and (2). **Correct**.\n- The gas-phase formulas for $n_i^g$ match the derived formula (3) and its equivalent form using $R_u$ and $N_A$. **Correct**.\n- The liquid-phase formulas for $n_i^\\ell$ match the derived formula (4) and its equivalent form using $x_i^\\ell$. **Correct**.\n- The explanation of unit consistency correctly identifies the $N_A$ factor error between molecular ($k_B$) and molar ($R_u$) constants, and the factor of $10^3$ error from inconsistent molar mass units. This is a precise and accurate description of the potential issues. **Correct**.\nThis option is entirely correct.\n\n**B. Use $x_{i} = \\dfrac{Y_{i} M_{i}}{\\sum_{j} Y_{j} M_{j}}$ and $Y_{i} = \\dfrac{x_{i}}{M_{i}}\\Big/\\sum_{j}\\dfrac{x_{j}}{M_{j}}$. In the gas phase, set $n_{i}^{g} = \\dfrac{p x_{i}^{g}}{R_{u} T}$ and in the liquid phase set $n_{i}^{\\ell} = \\dfrac{\\rho_{\\ell} x_{i}^{\\ell}}{\\bar{M}_{\\ell}}$. Unit consistency is secondary because ratios cancel common units; any inconsistent choice of $\\mathrm{kg/mol}$ or $\\mathrm{kg/kmol}$ will not affect $n_{i}^{g}$ or $n_{i}^{\\ell}$, since both are proportional to fractions.**\n- The fraction conversion formulas are the inverse of the correct ones. **Incorrect**.\n- The formula for gas-phase number density $n_i^g$ gives molar concentration $C_i^g$; it is missing the factor $N_A$. **Incorrect**.\n- The formula for liquid-phase number density $n_i^\\ell$ also gives a molar quantity, not a number density; it is missing the factor $N_A$. **Incorrect**.\n- The reasoning about unit consistency is dangerously false. Inconsistent units in a sum do not cancel. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In the gas phase, take $p_{i} = Y_{i}^{g} p$ and $n_{i}^{g} = \\dfrac{p_{i}}{k_{B} T}$. In the liquid phase, set $n_{i}^{\\ell} = \\dfrac{\\rho_{\\ell} Y_{i}^{\\ell}}{M_{i}}$. Unit consistency is not a concern for the liquid since Avogadro’s number $N_{A}$ cancels when forming evaporation fluxes, but in the gas phase consistency only requires using $k_{B}$ with $p$ and $T$.**\n- The relation $p_i = Y_i^g p$ is incorrect. The correct relation is Dalton's Law, $p_i = x_i^g p$. **Incorrect**.\n- The formula for liquid-phase number density $n_i^\\ell$ gives molar concentration $C_i^\\ell$; it is missing the factor $N_A$. **Incorrect**.\n- The reasoning about unit consistency is flawed. Consistency of $M_i$ units is critical in both phases, and the claim that $N_A$ just \"cancels\" is unsubstantiated and generally false. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use $x_{i} = \\dfrac{Y_{i}}{M_{i}}\\Big/\\sum_{j}\\dfrac{Y_{j}}{M_{j}}$ and $Y_{i} = \\dfrac{x_{i} M_{i}}{\\sum_{j} x_{j} M_{j}}$. For the gas phase, approximate $n_{i}^{g} = \\dfrac{p}{k_{B} T} Y_{i}^{g}$ with $p_{i} \\approx Y_{i}^{g} p$, and for the liquid use $n_{i}^{\\ell} = \\dfrac{\\rho_{\\ell} Y_{i}^{\\ell} N_{A}}{M_{i}}$. Unit consistency matters only in the gas phase because the liquid density already carries correct units, whereas the gas uses $k_{B}$ and $R_{u}$ interchangeably.**\n- The fraction conversions are correct.\n- The gas-phase formula is explicitly an approximation ($x_i^g \\approx Y_i^g$), not the correct formula. **Incorrect**.\n- The reasoning about unit consistency is flawed. It wrongly claims unit consistency is not an issue for the liquid phase and incorrectly states $k_B$ and $R_u$ are interchangeable. The latter is the source of a massive error. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In the gas phase compute $n_{i}^{g} = \\dfrac{\\rho_{g} Y_{i}^{g}}{M_{i}}$ with $\\rho_{g} = \\dfrac{p \\bar{M}_{g}}{R_{u} T}$ and $\\bar{M}_{g} = \\sum_{j} x_{j}^{g} M_{j}$, and take $x_{i}^{g} = \\dfrac{Y_{i}^{g} M_{i}}{\\bar{M}_{g}}$. In the liquid phase, $n_{i}^{\\ell} = \\dfrac{\\rho_{\\ell} Y_{i}^{\\ell}}{M_{i}} N_{A}$. Unit consistency is ensured if one always uses $\\bar{M}_{g}$ in both phases, because the mixture-average molar mass is a property of the system and does not depend on phase.**\n- The formula for $n_i^g$ gives molar concentration $(\\rho_i^g/M_i)$, not number density. It is missing $N_A$. **Incorrect**.\n- The formula given to convert $Y_i^g$ to $x_i^g$ is incorrect; it should be $x_i^g = Y_i^g \\bar{M}_g / M_i$. **Incorrect**.\n- The reasoning about unit consistency is based on a false premise. The mixture-average molar mass $\\bar{M}$ depends on mole fractions, which are generally different in the liquid and gas phases ($\\bar{M}_\\ell \\neq \\bar{M}_g$). **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option A presents a complete and correct set of formulas and a sound explanation for the critical nature of unit and constant consistency.",

            "problem": "An isolated spherical liquid droplet consisting of a binary mixture of species $A$ and $B$ evaporates into a quiescent, isothermal, and isobaric environment of nitrogen. The droplet is large enough that continuum transport applies and small enough that quasi-steady gas-phase diffusion with Stefan flow is valid. The ambient nitrogen contains no vapor of $A$ or $B$ far from the droplet. The interface is isothermal and at mechanical equilibrium.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All necessary data and conditions are provided, and they are physically and mathematically consistent. The problem describes a canonical scenario in transport phenomena and thermodynamics and can be solved using established principles.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the three tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Net Evaporation Mass Flux Expression**\n\nWe begin with the steady-state species conservation equation for a species $k$ in a spherically symmetric system, which is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 n_{k,r}) = 0\n$$\nwhere $n_{k,r}$ is the radial component of the mass flux vector for species $k$. This implies that the quantity $r^2 n_{k,r}$ is constant. The total evaporation rate of species $k$, $\\dot{m}_k$, is thus constant for all radii:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_k = 4 \\pi r^2 n_{k,r}\n$$\nThe mass flux $n_{k,r}$ is composed of a diffusive component (described by Fick's law) and an advective component (due to Stefan flow):\n$$\nn_{k,r} = j_{k,r} + Y_k n_r = -\\rho \\mathcal{D}_{km} \\frac{dY_k}{dr} + Y_k n_r\n$$\nwhere $Y_k$ is the mass fraction of species $k$, $\\rho$ is the gas mixture density, $\\mathcal{D}_{km}$ is the effective diffusion coefficient of species $k$ in the mixture, and $n_r = \\sum_k n_{k,r}$ is the total radial mass flux.\n\nThe problem states that nitrogen ($\\text{N}_2$) is an inert gas, meaning it does not evaporate from the droplet. Therefore, its net mass flux is zero everywhere:\n$$\nn_{\\text{N}_2, r} = 0\n$$\nApplying the flux equation to nitrogen, and using the simplification of identical binary diffusivities ($\\mathcal{D}_{k, \\text{N}_2} = \\mathcal{D}$ for $k=A,B$), we can treat the problem as a pseudo-binary system of combined vapors ($v = A+B$) diffusing into an inert ($i = \\text{N}_2$).\nThe flux of nitrogen is:\n$$\nn_{\\text{N}_2, r} = -\\rho \\mathcal{D} \\frac{dY_{\\text{N}_2}}{dr} + Y_{\\text{N}_2} n_r = 0\n$$\nSince the sum of mass fractions is unity, $Y_A + Y_B + Y_{\\text{N}_2} = 1$, we can write the total vapor mass fraction as $Y_v = Y_A + Y_B$, and thus $Y_{\\text{N}_2} = 1 - Y_v$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the design and implementation of a single-step numerical algorithm to update the state of an evaporating binary liquid droplet. The state is described by the liquid mole fractions of its components, $x_i$, and the corresponding gas-phase mole fractions at the droplet surface, $y_{i,s}$. The algorithm must be based on an explicit Euler time integration scheme and incorporate non-ideal liquid-phase thermodynamics, temperature-dependent vapor pressures, and gas-side mass transfer.\n\nThe core of the problem is to couple these physical phenomena into a discrete time-step update. The following is a step-by-step derivation of the algorithm, grounded in the provided physical principles.\n\nFirst, we define the state of the system at the beginning of a time step, $t^0$. The droplet is characterized by the number of moles of each species, $n_1^0$ and $n_2^0$, its radius $r$, and its temperature $T$. The surrounding gas is at a total pressure $P$ and has far-field mole fractions $y_{i,\\infty}$. Our goal is to find the state, specifically $x_i^1$ and $y_{i,s}^1$, at time $t^1 = t^0 + \\Delta t$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Evaluation of Interfacial Properties at $t^0$**\n\nTo calculate the mass transfer rate, we first need to determine the driving force, which depends on the gas-phase mole fractions at the liquid-gas interface, $y_{i,s}^0$. These are determined by phase equilibrium, described by the modified Raoult's law, which accounts for non-ideal behavior in the liquid phase.\n\nThe liquid mole fractions at $t^0$ are $x_1^0 = n_1^0 / (n_1^0+n_2^0)$ and $x_2^0 = n_2^0 / (n_1^0+n_2^0)$.\n\nThe non-ideality is captured by the activity coefficients, $\\gamma_i$, calculated using the two-suffix Margules model:\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_1 = A_{\\mathrm{M}} (x_2^0)^2 \\implies \\gamma_1^0 = \\exp\\left(A_{\\mathrm{M}} (x_2^0)^2\\right) $$\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_2 = A_{\\mathrm{M}} (x_1^0)^2 \\implies \\gamma_2^0 = \\exp\\left(A_{\\mathrm{M}} (x_1^0)^2\\right) $$\nwhere $A_{\\mathrm{M}}$ is the Margules parameter.\n\nThe saturation vapor pressure of each pure component, $p_i^{\\text{sat}}$, is a strong function of temperature. We use the Antoine equation, converting temperature from Kelvin to Celsius ($T_\\mathrm{C} = T - 273.15$) and pressure from mmHg to Pascals:\n$$ p_i^{\\text{sat}}(T) = 133.322 \\times 10^{A_i - \\frac{B_i}{C_i + T_\\mathrm{C}}} $$\nwhere $(A_i, B_i, C_i)$ are species-specific constants.\n\nWith $\\gamma_i^0$ and $p_i^{\\text{sat}}$ known, the interfacial partial pressure $p_{i,s}^0$ is given by Raoult's law:\n$$ p_{i,s}^0 = x_i^0 \\, \\gamma_i^0 \\, p_i^{\\text{sat}}(T) $$\nThe corresponding gas-phase mole fraction at the interface is then:\n$$ y_{i,s}^0 = \\frac{p_{i,s}^0}{P} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of Molar Fluxes at $t^0$**\n\nThe molar flux, $N_i$, of each species from the droplet surface to the bulk gas is modeled using film theory. The flux is proportional to the difference in mole fractions between the interface and the far-field.\nFirst, the total molar concentration of the gas, $c_g$, is determined from the ideal gas law:\n$$ c_g = \\frac{P}{R T} $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nThe molar flux for each species at $t^0$ is then:\n$$ N_i^0 = k_g \\, c_g \\, (y_{i,s}^0 - y_{i,\\infty}) $$\nwhere $k_g$ is the mass transfer coefficient, assumed to be the same for both species. A positive $N_i^0$ signifies evaporation, while a negative value signifies condensation.\n\n**Step 3: Explicit Euler Time Integration**\n\nThe change in the number of moles of species $i$ in the droplet is governed by mass conservation: $\\frac{d n_i}{d t} = - A \\, N_i$, where $A = 4 \\pi r^2$ is the droplet surface area. We discretize this ordinary differential equation using the explicit Euler method. The number of moles at the end of the time step, $n_i^1$, is approximated as:\n$$ n_i^1 = n_i^0 - A \\, N_i^0 \\, \\Delta t $$\nTo ensure physical realism, the number of moles cannot be negative. Therefore, we apply a clipping function:\n$$ n_i^1 = \\max(0, n_i^1) $$\n\n**Step 4: Update of State Variables at $t^1$**\n\nAfter updating the mole numbers to $n_1^1$ and $n_2^1$, we calculate the total moles in the droplet at $t^1$, $n_\\mathrm{L}^1 = n_1^1 + n_2^1$.\n\n A special numerical stability condition is handled: if $n_\\mathrm{L}^1$ is effectively zero (i.e., $n_\\mathrm{L}^1 < 10^{-16}$ mol), the droplet is considered fully evaporated. In this case, the composition is ill-defined, and for stability, we hold the mole fractions constant at their previous values: $x_i^1 = x_i^0$ and $y_{i,s}^1 = y_{i,s}^0$.\n\nIf $n_\\mathrm{L}^1$ is non-trivial, the new liquid mole fractions are computed by normalization:\n$$ x_i^1 = \\frac{n_i^1}{n_\\mathrm{L}^1} $$\nFinally, to complete the state update, the new interfacial gas-phase mole fractions, $y_{i,s}^1$, are calculated. This is done by reapplying the phase-equilibrium relations from Step 1, but using the newly computed liquid mole fractions $x_i^1$. The temperature $T$ is assumed to be constant over this single time step.\n$$ \\gamma_i^1 = \\exp(\\dots) \\text{ using } x_i^1 $$\n$$ p_{i,s}^1 = x_i^1 \\, \\gamma_i^1 \\, p_i^{\\text{sat}}(T) $$\n$$ y_{i,s}^1 = \\frac{p_{i,s}^1}{P} $$\n\nThis procedure yields the required outputs: the liquid mole fractions $x_1^1, x_2^1$ and interfacial gas mole fractions $y_{1,s}^1, y_{2,s}^1$ at the end of the single time step. The implementation will systematically execute these four steps for each of the provided test cases.",
