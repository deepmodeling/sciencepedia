For a droplet in a stagnant medium ($Re=0$), the quasi-steady evaporation rate is given by the classical Stefan flow solution:\n$$ \\dot{m}_{e, ref} = 2 \\pi d \\rho_g D_g \\ln(1 + B_m) $$\nwhere $\\rho_g$ is the gas density, $D_g$ is the gas-phase binary diffusivity, and $B_m$ is the Spalding mass transfer number. $B_m$ is a dimensionless driving potential for mass transfer, defined as:\n$$ B_m = \\frac{Y_{vs} - Y_{\\infty}}{1 - Y_{vs}} $$\nHere, $Y_{vs}$ is the vapor mass fraction at the droplet surface and $Y_{\\infty}$ is the ambient vapor mass fraction.\n\nForced convection enhances the mass transfer rate. This enhancement is quantified by the Sherwood number, $Sh$. The evaporation rate in the presence of convection, $\\dot{m}_e$, is related to the stagnant reference rate by multiplying by a convective correction factor, commonly taken as $Sh/2$.\n$$ \\dot{m}_e = \\dot{m}_{e, ref} \\left( \\frac{Sh}{2} \\right) = \\left( 2 \\pi d \\rho_g D_g \\ln(1 + B_m) \\right) \\left( \\frac{Sh}{2} \\right) = \\pi d \\rho_g D_g Sh \\ln(1 + B_m) $$\nThe problem provides the Ranz-Marshall correlation for the Sherwood number, which is a function of the Reynolds number, $Re(t)$, and the Schmidt number, $Sc$:\n$$ Sh(t) = 2 + 0.6 \\, Re(t)^{1/2} \\, Sc^{1/3} $$\nThis correlation correctly yields $Sh=2$ for the stagnant case ($Re=0$), recovering the reference evaporation rate.\n\nNow, we equate the two expressions by applying mass conservation, $\\frac{dm_l}{dt} = -\\dot{m}_e$:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi \\rho_l d}{4} \\frac{d(d^2)}{dt} = - \\left( \\pi d \\rho_g D_g Sh(t) \\ln(1 + B_m) \\right) $$\nAssuming the droplet has not fully evaporated ($d  0$), we can cancel the term $\\pi d$ from both sides:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_l}{4} \\frac{d(d^2)}{dt} = - \\rho_g D_g Sh(t) \\ln(1 + B_m) $$\nRearranging this gives the ordinary differential equation for the evolution of the squared diameter, known as the d-squared law:\n$$ \\frac{d(d^2)}{dt} = - \\frac{4 \\rho_g D_g}{\\rho_l} Sh(t) \\ln(1 + B_m) $$\nThis is of the form $\\frac{d(d^2)}{dt} = -K(t)$, where $K(t)$ is the time-varying evaporation constant:\n$$ K(t) = \\frac{4 \\rho_g D_g}{\\rho_l} \\ln(1 + B_m) \\left( 2 + 0.6 \\, Re(t)^{1/2} \\, Sc^{1/3} \\right) $$\nSince all properties ($\\rho_g$, $D_g$, $\\rho_l$, $Sc$, $Y_{vs}$, $Y_{\\infty}$) are assumed constant, $B_m$ is constant for each case, and $K(t)$ varies with time only through the given function $Re(t)$.\n\nTo find the squared diameter at a final time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, we integrate the differential equation from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\mathrm{end}}$:\n$$ \\int_{d^2(0)}^{d^2(t_{\\mathrm{end}})} d(d^2) = - \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{end}}} K(t) dt $$\n$$ d^2(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) - d^2(0) = - \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{end}}} K(t) dt $$\nWith the initial condition $d^2(0) = d_0^2$, the final squared diameter is:\n$$ d^2(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = d_0^2 - \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{end}}} K(t) dt $$\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n$1$. For each test case, retrieve the given parameters: $d_0$, $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, $D_g$, $\\rho_g$, $\\rho_l$, $Sc$, $Y_{vs}$, $Y_{\\infty}$, and the function for $Re(t)$.\n$2$. Calculate the constant Spalding number $B_m$.\n$3$. Create a uniform time grid from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\mathrm{end}}$ with a sufficiently large number of points, $N$, to ensure numerical accuracy.\n$4$. Evaluate the function $Re(t)$ at each point on the time grid.\n$5$. Using the values of $Re(t)$ and the constant $Sc$, evaluate the evaporation constant $K(t)$ at each point on the time grid using the derived formula.\n$6$. Numerically compute the definite integral of $K(t)$ from $0$ to $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$ using the trapezoidal rule.\n$7$. Calculate the final squared diameter using $d^2(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = d_0^2 - \\text{integral}$.\n$8$. Enforce the physical constraint that the squared diameter cannot be negative. If the calculated value is less than $0$, the result is set to $0$, signifying complete evaporation. This is achieved by taking $\\max(0, d^2(t_{\\mathrm{end}}))$.\nThis procedure will be implemented for each test case provided.",
