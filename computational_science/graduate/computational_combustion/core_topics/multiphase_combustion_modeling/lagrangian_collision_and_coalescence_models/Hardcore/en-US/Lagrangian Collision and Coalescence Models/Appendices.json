The parcels have a statistically stationary relative speed magnitude $|u_{ij}|$ during a timestep of duration $\\Delta t$, and collisions have a collection efficiency $E_{c} \\in (0,1]$ accounting for hydrodynamic interactions.

            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part analysis of a collision model used in computational combustion simulations: first, the derivation of the approximate No-Time-Counter (NTC) collision probability; second, an analysis of its limitations and potential remedies; and third, the derivation of a corrected, physically consistent collision probability. The validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and based on established principles in multiphase flow modeling. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the NTC expression for the collision probability, $P_{ij}$. The fundamental premise is that droplet collisions within the computational cell volume $V_c$ constitute a Poisson process. The rate of this process, $\\lambda_{ij}$, must be determined.\n\nConsider a single droplet from parcel $i$ and a single droplet from parcel $j$. The problem defines the collision kernel per droplet pair, $k_{ij}$, with units of volume per time. This kernel represents the volume swept out per unit time by one droplet relative to the other, corrected for collection efficiency. Assuming the droplets are uniformly distributed throughout the cell volume $V_c$, the probability per unit time of these two specific droplets colliding is the ratio of the swept volume rate to the total volume, which is $\\frac{k_{ij}}{V_c}$. This quantity has units of T$^{-1}$ and represents a frequency, or a rate.\n\nThe model considers $N_i$ droplets in parcel $i$ and $N_j$ droplets in parcel $j$. The total number of distinct interacting pairs between the two parcels is $N_i N_j$. Since the process is assumed to be dilute, the collisions of different pairs are treated as independent events. Therefore, the total rate of collision events between any droplet from parcel $i$ and any droplet from parcel $j$ is the rate per pair multiplied by the total number of pairs:\n$$\n\\lambda_{ij} = N_i N_j \\left( \\frac{k_{ij}}{V_c} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the problem's definition of the parcel-pair event-rate coefficient, $\\beta_{ij} \\equiv N_i N_j k_{ij}$, the total collision rate can be written as:\n$$\n\\lambda_{ij} = \\frac{\\beta_{ij}}{V_c}\n$$\nFor a Poisson process with a constant mean rate $\\lambda_{ij}$, the probability of observing exactly $k$ events in a time interval $\\Delta t$ is given by:\n$$\nP(k; \\lambda_{ij}, \\Delta t) = \\frac{(\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t)^k \\exp(-\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t)}{k!}\n$$\nThe probability of at least one collision is $P(k \\ge 1) = 1 - P(k=0)$. The probability of zero collisions is:\n$$\nP(k=0) = \\frac{(\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t)^0 \\exp(-\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t)\n$$\nThus, the exact probability of at least one collision during $\\Delta t$ is:\n$$\nP_{ij, \\text{exact}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}\\right)\n$$\nThe NTC expression is a leading-order approximation of this exact probability, valid in the limit where the expected number of events is small. Let $x = \\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}$. For $x \\ll 1$, we can use the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function, $e^{-x} \\approx 1 - x$. Substituting this into the exact probability expression yields the approximation:\n$$\nP_{ij} \\approx 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}\n$$\nThis is the desired NTC expression. The key modeling assumptions that lead to this linear-in-time form are:\n1.  Collisions are modeled as a memoryless Poisson process, implying events are independent and random, which is appropriate for dilute sprays.\n2.  Droplets from both parcels are uniformly distributed throughout the cell volume $V_c$, which justifies the use of macroscopic number densities.\n3.  The collision rate $\\lambda_{ij}$ is constant over the timestep $\\Delta t$. This is supported by the problem statement's condition of a \"statistically stationary relative speed magnitude $|u_{ij}|$\" and implies that $N_i$ and $N_j$ do not change significantly due to collisions within that timestep.\n4.  The expected number of collision events during the timestep is much less than one, i.e., $\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t = \\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c} \\ll 1$. This is the crucial mathematical assumption that validates the linearization of the exponential function.\n\nNext, we analyze the probabilistic consistency constraint $P_{ij} \\le 1$. The NTC expression $P_{ij} = \\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}$ is a linear function of its parameters and is unbounded. It can exceed $1$, which is a violation of the definition of probability. This violation occurs in practice when the assumption $\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t \\ll 1$ is broken. This happens under conditions of:\n-   A large timestep, $\\Delta t$.\n-   A small computational cell volume, $V_c$.\n-   Large droplet numbers in the parcels, $N_i$ and $N_j$.\n-   A large collision kernel, $k_{ij}$, which can result from large droplet diameters ($d_i, d_j$) or high relative speeds ($|u_{ij}|$).\nSuch conditions are common in regions of dense spray, near injectors, or where the computational mesh is highly refined.\n\nPhysically consistent remedies must be employed to handle cases where $P_{ij}  1$. These remedies should ensure that the collision statistics are handled correctly without introducing bias, and that mass and number are conserved.\n1.  **Substepping:** The most direct way to enforce the condition $\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t \\ll 1$ is to reduce $\\Delta t$. If the overall fluid-dynamics timestep $\\Delta t$ is too large, it can be divided into $M$ smaller collision substeps of duration $\\Delta t_s = \\Delta t / M$. The number of substeps $M$ is chosen such that the collision probability in a substep, $P_{ij,s} = \\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t_s}{V_c}$, is well below $1$. After each substep, the parcel populations ($N_i, N_j$) are updated if a collision-coalescence event occurs. This method correctly models the depleting population of reactants (colliding droplets) over the full timestep $\\Delta t$. However, it increases computational cost significantly.\n2.  **Using an Exact-Event Probability:** A more computationally efficient remedy is to abandon the linear NTC approximation and use a more accurate probability expression. The issue with $P_{ij}  1$ is that it implies an average of more than one collision event in the timestep. Instead of simply capping the probability at $1$ (which would bias the collision rate downwards), one can use a formulation that is inherently bounded. The exact Poisson probability for at least one event, $P_{ij, \\text{exact}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t)$, is a natural choice. This expression is always in the range $[0, 1)$ and correctly represents the probability of one or more collisions. If a collision is sampled using this probability, it is typically assumed that a single coalescence event occurs. This is still an approximation, as it doesn't account for the possibility of multiple distinct collision events within $\\Delta t$, but it is a significant improvement over the NTC method and avoids the unphysical $P_{ij}  1$ issue without the cost of substepping.\n\nFinally, we are asked to provide a single closed-form analytical expression for a corrected collision probability, $\\widetilde{P}_{ij}$, that satisfies three conditions: validity for arbitrary $\\Delta t$, automatic enforcement of $\\widetilde{P}_{ij} \\le 1$, and reduction to the NTC form in the appropriate limit.\n\nAs derived and discussed above, the exact probability for at least one event in a Poisson process meets all these criteria. Let us define the corrected probability $\\widetilde{P}_{ij}$ as this exact probability:\n$$\n\\widetilde{P}_{ij} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{ij} \\Delta t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}\\right)\n$$\nLet's verify the conditions:\n1.  **Validity for arbitrary $\\Delta t$**: The exponential function is defined for all real arguments. As $\\Delta t \\ge 0$, the argument of the exponential is always non-positive, and the function is well-behaved.\n2.  **Enforces $\\widetilde{P}_{ij} \\le 1$**: Since all physical quantities ($\\beta_{ij}$, $\\Delta t$, $V_c$) are non-negative, the argument of the exponential, $-\\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}$, is always less than or equal to $0$. Thus, $0  \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}\\right) \\le 1$. It follows that $0 \\le 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}\\right)  1$. The condition $\\widetilde{P}_{ij} \\le 1$ is therefore always satisfied.\n3.  **Reduces to NTC expression**: In the limit where $\\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c} \\ll 1$, we use the Taylor expansion $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$.\n    $$\n    \\widetilde{P}_{ij} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta_{ij} \\Delta t}{V_c}\n    $$\n    This is precisely the NTC expression.\n\nTherefore, the corrected collision probability is the exact Poisson probability for at least one event.",

            "problem": "Consider two Lagrangian liquid-fuel parcels in a high-pressure combustor. Parcel $1$ has mass $m_1$ and velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}_1$, and parcel $2$ has mass $m_2$ and velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}_2$. They undergo a coalescing collision and are merged into a single parcel of mass $m = m_1 + m_2$. In the Lagrangian collision–coalescence update, linear momentum is conserved, and the merged parcel is advanced with a single mean velocity determined by conservation of momentum. However, because the two incoming parcels have different velocities, there exists relative translational kinetic energy associated with their motion that is generally dissipated during coalescence.\n\nIn a computational combustion model, suppose you wish to maintain the total parcel-ensemble kinetic energy at the discrete level by attributing the dissipated relative translational energy to a stored, isotropic, zero-mean agitation represented by a pseudo-velocity $\\boldsymbol{u}$ associated with the merged parcel. This pseudo-velocity contributes to the parcel’s kinetic energy as $\\tfrac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$ but is not used for momentum update or advection, so it does not alter linear momentum.\n\nStarting only from conservation of linear momentum, the definition of kinetic energy, and vector algebra, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the squared magnitude $|\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$ that is necessary and sufficient to make the merged parcel’s total (mean plus agitation) kinetic energy exactly equal to the sum of the two incoming parcels’ translational kinetic energies.

It describes a physically consistent scenario of an inelastic collision within a clearly defined modeling framework. The necessary information is provided to derive a unique solution based on the principles of conservation of linear momentum and a prescribed form of energy conservation.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental principles of conservation of linear momentum and the total energy balance as defined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we establish the velocity of the merged parcel. The collision is governed by the conservation of linear momentum. The total momentum before the collision is the sum of the individual momenta of the two parcels:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{P}_{\\text{initial}} = m_1 \\boldsymbol{v}_1 + m_2 \\boldsymbol{v}_2\n$$\nAfter the collision, the two parcels merge into a single parcel of mass $m = m_1 + m_2$ moving with a mean velocity $\\boldsymbol{v}$.

The total kinetic energy of the two parcels before the collision is the sum of their individual translational kinetic energies:\n$$\nK_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2\n$$\nAfter the collision, the problem states that the total kinetic energy of the merged parcel is the sum of its mean translational kinetic energy, $\\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{v}|^2$, and a stored agitation energy, $\\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$.\n$$\nK_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{v}|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2\n$$\nThe problem requires that the total energy be conserved, so $K_{\\text{initial}} = K_{\\text{final}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m_1 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{v}|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2\n$$\nWe want to find an expression for $|\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$. Rearranging the equation to solve for the agitation energy term gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} m_1 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{v}|^2\n$$\nThis equation shows that the agitation energy term, $\\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$, is precisely the difference between the initial kinetic energy and the final mean kinetic energy of the system. This difference is the kinetic energy that is \"lost\" or dissipated from the bulk translational motion during the inelastic coalescence.\n\nTo find $|\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$, we first solve for the dissipated energy. Let's substitute the expressions for $m$ and $\\boldsymbol{v}$:\n$$\nm |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2 = m_1 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 - (m_1 + m_2) \\left| \\frac{m_1 \\boldsymbol{v}_1 + m_2 \\boldsymbol{v}_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\right|^2\n$$\nThe last term can be expanded using the property $|\\boldsymbol{a}|^2 = \\boldsymbol{a} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{a}$:\n$$\n(m_1 + m_2) \\frac{(m_1 \\boldsymbol{v}_1 + m_2 \\boldsymbol{v}_2) \\cdot (m_1 \\boldsymbol{v}_1 + m_2 \\boldsymbol{v}_2)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} = \\frac{m_1^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 (\\boldsymbol{v}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_2)}{m_1 + m_2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $m |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$:\n$$\nm |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2 = m_1 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 - \\frac{m_1^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 (\\boldsymbol{v}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_2)}{m_1 + m_2}\n$$\nTo simplify, we put all terms over the common denominator $(m_1 + m_2)$:\n$$\nm |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2 = \\frac{(m_1 + m_2)(m_1 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2) - (m_1^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 (\\boldsymbol{v}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_2))}{m_1 + m_2}\n$$\nExpanding the first part of the numerator:\n$$\n(m_1 + m_2)(m_1 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2) = m_1^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_1 m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 + m_2 m_1 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the numerator expression and simplifying:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = (m_1^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_1 m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 + m_1 m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2) - (m_1^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_2^2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 (\\boldsymbol{v}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_2))\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = m_1 m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 + m_1 m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 - 2 m_1 m_2 (\\boldsymbol{v}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_2)\n$$\nFactoring out the term $m_1 m_2$:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = m_1 m_2 (|\\boldsymbol{v}_1|^2 - 2 (\\boldsymbol{v}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_2) + |\\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2)\n$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is the expansion of the squared magnitude of the relative velocity vector, $(\\boldsymbol{v}_1 - \\boldsymbol{v}_2) \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{v}_1 - \\boldsymbol{v}_2) = |\\boldsymbol{v}_1 - \\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2$.\nThus, the numerator simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = m_1 m_2 |\\boldsymbol{v}_1 - \\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2\n$$\nThis result explicitly identifies the central role of the incoming relative motion, as requested. The dissipated energy depends directly on the relative velocity between the parcels.\nSo we have:\n$$\nm |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2 = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} |\\boldsymbol{v}_1 - \\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$ is the reduced mass of the system, often denoted by $\\mu$. The dissipated energy is therefore $\\frac{1}{2} \\mu |\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\text{rel}}|^2$, which is the kinetic energy associated with the relative motion of the two parcels in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nFinally, we solve for $|\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$ by dividing by the total mass $m = m_1 + m_2$:\n$$\n|\\boldsymbol{u}|^2 = \\frac{1}{m_1 + m_2} \\left(\\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\\right) |\\boldsymbol{v}_1 - \\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2 = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} |\\boldsymbol{v}_1 - \\boldsymbol{v}_2|^2\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the squared magnitude of the pseudo-velocity.\n\nIn a physical coalescence, the dissipated kinetic energy, $\\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$, is converted into other energy forms. The pseudo-velocity $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is a modeling construct to track this energy. The primary physical reservoirs for this energy are:\n$1$. Internal Energy: Viscous dissipation during the fluid deformation and merging of the parcels converts kinetic energy into thermal energy, resulting in a temperature rise.\n$2$. Surface Energy: Two spherical parcels have a total surface area $A_i \\propto (m_1^{2/3} + m_2^{2/3})$, while the merged spherical parcel has an area $A_f \\propto (m_1+m_2)^{2/3}$. Since $x^{2/3}$ is a concave function, $A_i  A_f$. This reduction in surface area releases surface energy $\\Delta E_s = \\sigma (A_i - A_f)$, where $\\sigma$ is the surface tension. This energy is also largely converted to internal heat.\n$3$. Vibrational and Rotational Energy: The resulting merged parcel may be left in an oscillating, non-spherical shape or with bulk rotation, representing another temporary energy reservoir.\n\nThe computational model's use of $\\frac{1}{2} m |\\boldsymbol{u}|^2$ lumps these complex physical effects into a single, tractable scalar quantity, ensuring that energy is conserved within the discrete numerical simulation.",

The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any fundamental principles. The numerical values are physically plausible. The assumption that $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is a known standard quantile does not render the problem incomplete.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Part 1: Confidence Interval for the Rate $r$**\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is assumed to apply to the sample mean $\\bar{C} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{k=1}^{M} C_k$. For a large number of steps $M$, the distribution of $\\bar{C}$ is approximately normal with mean $\\mu_C$ and variance $\\sigma_C^2/M$. We can write this as:\n$$ \\bar{C} \\approx N\\left(\\mu_C, \\frac{\\sigma_C^2}{M}\\right) $$\nStandardizing the random variable $\\bar{C}$, we obtain a standard normal variable $Z$:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{C} - \\mu_C}{\\sigma_C / \\sqrt{M}} \\approx N(0, 1) $$\nSince the true population variance $\\sigma_C^2$ is unknown, we use its unbiased estimator, the sample variance $s_C^2$. For a large sample size ($M=8000$ in the pilot run is sufficiently large), we can approximate $\\sigma_C$ with $s_C$. The pivotal quantity for the confidence interval is thus:\n$$ Z \\approx \\frac{\\bar{C} - \\mu_C}{s_C / \\sqrt{M}} $$\nFor a $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence level, the following probabilistic statement holds for a standard normal variable $Z$:\n$$ P(-z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\le Z \\le z_{1-\\alpha/2}) = 1-\\alpha $$\nwhere $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the quantile of the standard normal distribution such that $P(Z \\le z_{1-\\alpha/2}) = 1-\\alpha/2$. Substituting the expression for $Z$, we get:\n$$ P\\left(-z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\le \\frac{\\bar{C} - \\mu_C}{s_C / \\sqrt{M}} \\le z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\right) \\approx 1-\\alpha $$\nTo find the confidence interval for the true mean $\\mu_C$, we rearrange the inequalities:\n$$ \\bar{C} - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{s_C}{\\sqrt{M}} \\le \\mu_C \\le \\bar{C} + z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{s_C}{\\sqrt{M}} $$\nThe collision rate is defined as $r = \\mu_C / \\Delta t$. Since $\\Delta t$ is a positive constant, we can divide the entire inequality by $\\Delta t$ without changing the direction of the inequalities to obtain the confidence interval for $r$:\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{C}}{\\Delta t} - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{s_C}{\\Delta t \\sqrt{M}} \\le \\frac{\\mu_C}{\\Delta t} \\le \\frac{\\bar{C}}{\\Delta t} + z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{s_C}{\\Delta t \\sqrt{M}} $$\nRecognizing the estimator $\\hat{r} = \\bar{C} / \\Delta t$, the approximate $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for the true rate $r$ is:\n$$ \\hat{r} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{s_C}{\\Delta t \\sqrt{M}} $$\nWe now evaluate this interval for the pilot run. The confidence level is $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, so $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. The required quantile is $z_{1-0.025} = z_{0.975}$. The standard value, which we use, is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.960$.\nThe given pilot data are: $M = 8000$, $\\Delta t = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s}$, $\\bar{C} = 3.7$, and $s_C^2 = 5.5$. Therefore, $s_C = \\sqrt{5.5}$.\nFirst, we calculate the point estimate of the rate, $\\hat{r}$:\n$$ \\hat{r} = \\frac{\\bar{C}}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{3.7}{2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{s}} = 185000\\ \\text{s}^{-1} = 1.85 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nNext, we calculate the half-width of the confidence interval, also known as the margin of error, $E$:\n$$ E = z_{0.975} \\frac{s_C}{\\Delta t \\sqrt{M}} = 1.960 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{5.5}}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\sqrt{8000}} \\approx 2569.56\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for $r$ are $r_{lower} = \\hat{r} - E$ and $r_{upper} = \\hat{r} + E$.\n$$ r_{lower} = 185000 - 2569.56 = 182430.44\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ r_{upper} = 185000 + 2569.56 = 187569.56\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nRounding these results to four significant figures:\n$$ r_{lower} \\approx 1.824 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ r_{upper} \\approx 1.876 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\n**Part 2: Required Number of Steps $M$**\n\nThe relative half-width of the confidence interval is defined as the ratio of the half-width $E$ to the true rate $r$. The half-width for the rate $r$ is $E = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma_C}{\\Delta t \\sqrt{M}}$, and the true rate is $r = \\mu_C / \\Delta t$.\nThe relative half-width is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{E}{r} = \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma_C}{\\Delta t \\sqrt{M}}}{\\frac{\\mu_C}{\\Delta t}} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma_C}{\\mu_C \\sqrt{M}} $$\nThe term $\\sigma_C / \\mu_C$ is the coefficient of variation of the counts, denoted as $CV_C$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{E}{r} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{CV_C}{\\sqrt{M}} $$\nWe require this relative half-width to be at most a target value $\\delta$:\n$$ z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{CV_C}{\\sqrt{M}} \\le \\delta $$\nSolving this inequality for $M$:\n$$ \\sqrt{M} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{CV_C}{\\delta} $$\n$$ M \\ge \\left( \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} CV_C}{\\delta} \\right)^2 $$\nTo compute the required $M$, we use the pilot simulation statistics as plug-in estimates for the unknown population parameters. The coefficient of variation $CV_C$ is estimated by $\\widehat{CV}_C = s_C / \\bar{C}$.\nThe given values are $\\delta = 0.03$ and $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, which implies $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.960$.\nThe plug-in estimate for the coefficient of variation is:\n$$ \\widehat{CV}_C = \\frac{s_C}{\\bar{C}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5.5}}{3.7} \\approx 0.63384 $$\nSubstituting these values into the inequality for $M$:\n$$ M \\ge \\left( \\frac{1.960 \\times (\\sqrt{5.5} / 3.7)}{0.03} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ M \\ge \\left( \\frac{1.960 \\times 0.63384}{0.03} \\right)^2 \\approx (41.4109)^2 \\approx 1714.86 $$\nSince the number of steps $M$ must be an integer, we must round up to the next integer to guarantee the condition is met.\n$$ M_{req} = 1715 $$\nThis value, $1715$, is presented with four significant figures as required.\n\nThe final numerical results are the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the rate $r$, and the required number of steps $M$.\n$r_{lower} \\approx 1.824 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$r_{upper} \\approx 1.876 \\times 10^5\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$M = 1715$",
