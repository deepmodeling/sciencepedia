This first exercise provides a foundational practice in uncertainty propagation by asking you to analytically determine how uncertainties in the pre-exponential factor ($A$) and activation energy ($E$) translate into uncertainty in the reaction rate constant ($k$). By treating the parameters as random variables, you will derive the resulting probability distribution for $k$, a critical skill for assessing the reliability of any reaction model. ",

At a fixed temperature $T0$, suppose that the uncertainty in $A$ and $E$ arises from unresolved multiscale physics and measurement variability and is modeled as follows: $\\ln A$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu_A$ and variance $\\sigma_A^2$, and $E$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu_E$ and variance $\\sigma_E^2$.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the specified criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The Arrhenius law: $k(T)=A\\exp(-E/(R T))$\n- Temperature $T$ is a fixed positive constant, $T0$.\n- The Universal Gas Constant is $R$.\n- The logarithm of the pre-exponential factor, $\\ln A$, is a random variable following a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_A$ and variance $\\sigma_A^2$. This can be written as $\\ln A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_A, \\sigma_A^2)$.\n- The activation energy, $E$, is a random variable following a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_E$ and variance $\\sigma_E^2$. This can be written as $E \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_E, \\sigma_E^2)$.\n- The random variables $A$ and $E$ are statistically independent.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses the Arrhenius equation, a fundamental principle in chemical kinetics. The modeling of parameter uncertainty using probability distributions (specifically log-normal for $A$ and normal for $E$) is a standard and physically justified practice in uncertainty quantification for combustion and chemical systems. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear functional relationship and complete probabilistic descriptions of the input random variables. The request to derive the probability density function (PDF) of the output is a standard problem in probability theory (transformation of random variables) and has a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** All necessary information is provided. The assumption of statistical independence is crucial and explicitly stated. There are no contradictions. The condition $T0$ ensures the expression is well-defined.\n- **Feasibility:** The scenario is a realistic representation of uncertainty analysis in computational models.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Solution**\nThe goal is to derive the probability density function (PDF) of the rate coefficient $k$, denoted as $f_k(k)$. The rate coefficient is given by the Arrhenius law:\n$$k = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT}\\right)$$\nTo simplify the product and exponential forms, we take the natural logarithm of $k$:\n$$\\ln k = \\ln\\left(A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT}\\right)\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we get:\n$$\\ln k = \\ln A - \\frac{E}{RT}$$\nLet us define a new random variable $Y = \\ln k$. We can express $Y$ as the difference of two random variables, $Y = X_1 - X_2$, where:\n$$X_1 = \\ln A$$\n$$X_2 = \\frac{E}{RT}$$\nWe are given the distribution of $X_1$. Since $\\ln A$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu_A$ and variance $\\sigma_A^2$, we have:\n$$X_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_A, \\sigma_A^2)$$\nNext, we determine the distribution of $X_2$. $X_2$ is a linear transformation of the random variable $E$, where the scaling factor is $1/(RT)$. Since $E$ is normally distributed, $E \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_E, \\sigma_E^2)$, the random variable $X_2$ is also normally distributed. Its mean and variance are:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X_2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{E}{RT}\\right] = \\frac{1}{RT}\\mathbb{E}[E] = \\frac{\\mu_E}{RT}$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X_2) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{E}{RT}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{RT}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(E) = \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{R^2 T^2}$$\nThus, the distribution of $X_2$ is:\n$$X_2 \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_E}{RT}, \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{R^2 T^2}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that $A$ and $E$ are statistically independent. This implies that any functions of these variables, such as $X_1 = \\ln A$ and $X_2 = E/(RT)$, are also statistically independent.\nThe random variable $Y = \\ln k$ is the difference of two independent normal random variables, $X_1$ and $X_2$. The sum or difference of independent normal random variables is itself a normal random variable. The mean of $Y$, denoted $\\mu_Y$, is the difference of the means of $X_1$ and $X_2$:\n$$\\mu_Y = \\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[X_1 - X_2] = \\mathbb{E}[X_1] - \\mathbb{E}[X_2] = \\mu_A - \\frac{\\mu_E}{RT}$$\nThe variance of $Y$, denoted $\\sigma_Y^2$, is the sum of the variances of $X_1$ and $X_2$ (due to their independence):\n$$\\sigma_Y^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_1 - X_2) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_1) + \\mathrm{Var}(X_2) = \\sigma_A^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{R^2 T^2}$$\nSo, the random variable $Y = \\ln k$ follows a normal distribution:\n$$Y = \\ln k \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_A - \\frac{\\mu_E}{RT}, \\sigma_A^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{R^2 T^2}\\right)$$\nA random variable $k$ whose natural logarithm is normally distributed is said to follow a log-normal distribution. The PDF of a log-normal random variable $k$, for which $\\ln k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y^2)$, is given by the general formula:\n$$f_k(k) = \\frac{1}{k \\sigma_Y \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\ln k - \\mu_Y)^2}{2\\sigma_Y^2}\\right), \\quad \\text{for } k0$$\nSubstituting our derived expressions for $\\mu_Y$ and $\\sigma_Y^2$ into this formula gives the PDF of $k$:\n$$f_k(k) = \\frac{1}{k \\sqrt{2\\pi \\left(\\sigma_A^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{R^2 T^2}\\right)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(\\ln k - \\left(\\mu_A - \\frac{\\mu_E}{RT}\\right)\\right)^2}{2\\left(\\sigma_A^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{R^2 T^2}\\right)}\\right)$$\nThis can be written more cleanly as:\n$$f_k(k) = \\frac{1}{k \\sqrt{2\\pi\\left(\\sigma_A^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{R^2T^2}\\right)}} \\exp\\left( - \\frac{\\left( \\ln k - \\mu_A + \\frac{\\mu_E}{RT} \\right)^2}{2\\left(\\sigma_A^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{R^2T^2}\\right)} \\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the probability density function of the rate coefficient $k$.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by formulating the problem as a linear regression, from which all desired quantities can be derived.\n\n**1. Linear Model Formulation**\nThe measurement model is given by:\n$$\ny_i = \\theta_1 - \\theta_2 \\frac{T_0}{T_i} + \\varepsilon_i\n$$\nThis can be written in the standard linear model form $\\mathbf{y} = X\\boldsymbol{\\theta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$. For a set of $N$ temperature measurements $\\{T_i\\}_{i=1}^N$, the model is:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_N \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -T_0/T_1 \\\\ 1  -T_0/T_2 \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots \\\\ 1  -T_0/T_N \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_1 \\\\ \\varepsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\varepsilon_N \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{y}$ is the vector of observations, $X$ is the $N \\times 2$ design matrix, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is the parameter vector, and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the vector of i.i.d. Gaussian noise terms with $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\sigma_y^2 I)$, where $I$ is the $N \\times N$ identity matrix.\n\n**2. Posterior Distribution via Laplace Approximation**\nGiven a uniform prior $p(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\propto 1$, the posterior distribution is proportional to the likelihood:\n$$\np(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} | \\mathbf{y}) \\propto L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}; \\mathbf{y}) \\propto \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma_y^2} (\\mathbf{y} - X\\boldsymbol{\\theta})^\\top (\\mathbf{y} - X\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\right)\n$$\nThe Laplace approximation states that the posterior can be approximated by a multivariate normal distribution centered at the posterior mode $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$, with a covariance matrix equal to the inverse of the Hessian of the negative log-posterior evaluated at the mode. For this linear-Gaussian problem, the approximation is exact. The mode $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ is the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE), given by the standard least-squares solution:\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = (X^\\top X)^{-1} X^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n$$\nThe Hessian of the negative log-likelihood is $H = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_y^2} X^\\top X$.\nThe covariance matrix of the posterior distribution for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = H^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_y^2} X^\\top X\\right)^{-1} = \\sigma_y^2 (X^\\top X)^{-1}\n$$\nThus, the posterior is approximated as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} | \\mathbf{y} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}, \\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})$.\n\n**3. Characteristics of the Confidence Ellipse**\nThe $95\\%$ confidence (or credible) region for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is an ellipse defined by the equation:\n$$\n(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})^\\top \\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}^{-1} (\\boldsymbol{\\theta} - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) \\le s^2\n$$\nwhere $s^2$ is the $95$-th percentile of the chi-squared distribution with $k=2$ degrees of freedom, i.e., $s^2 = \\chi^2_{2; 0.95} \\approx 5.9915$.\n\n- **Semi-axes ($a, b$) and Axis Ratio ($\\kappa$):** Let $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ be the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$, with $\\lambda_{\\text{max}} \\ge \\lambda_{\\text{min}}$. The semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse are given by:\n$$\na = \\sqrt{s^2 \\lambda_{\\text{max}}}, \\quad b = \\sqrt{s^2 \\lambda_{\\text{min}}}\n$$\nThe axis ratio is $\\kappa = a/b = \\sqrt{\\lambda_{\\text{max}} / \\lambda_{\\text{min}}}$.\n\n- **Orientation Angle ($\\alpha$):** The orientation of the ellipse is determined by the eigenvectors of $\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$. The major axis is aligned with the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$. If this eigenvector is $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{max}} = [v_x, v_y]^\\top$, the angle $\\alpha$ with respect to the $\\theta_1$ axis is:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\mathrm{atan2}(v_y, v_x)\n$$\n\n**4. Derived Statistical Quantities**\n- **Posterior Correlation ($\\rho$):** The correlation coefficient between $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ is derived from the components of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Sigma_{11}  \\Sigma_{12} \\\\ \\Sigma_{21}  \\Sigma_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\Sigma_{12}}{\\sqrt{\\Sigma_{11} \\Sigma_{22}}}\n$$\n\n- **Condition Number ($\\mathrm{cond}(X^\\top X)$):** The condition number of the normal matrix $M = X^\\top X$ is a measure of its sensitivity to inversion, which reflects the collinearity of the columns of $X$. For a symmetric positive definite matrix, the $2$-norm condition number is the ratio of its largest to its smallest eigenvalue:\n$$\n\\mathrm{cond}_2(X^\\top X) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(X^\\top X)}{\\lambda_{\\text{min}}(X^\\top X)}\n$$\nThere is a direct relationship between the axis ratio $\\kappa$ and the condition number:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})}{\\lambda_{\\text{min}}(\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})} = \\frac{\\sigma_y^2 \\lambda_{\\text{max}}((X^\\top X)^{-1})}{\\sigma_y^2 \\lambda_{\\text{min}}((X^\\top X)^{-1})} = \\frac{1/\\lambda_{\\text{min}}(X^\\top X)}{1/\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(X^\\top X)} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{max}}(X^\\top X)}{\\lambda_{\\text{min}}(X^\\top X)} = \\mathrm{cond}_2(X^\\top X)\n$$\nHence, $\\kappa = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{cond}_2(X^\\top X)}$. This provides a valuable consistency check.\n\n**5. Algorithm**\nFor each test case with a given set of temperatures $\\{T_i\\}$ and noise standard deviation $\\sigma_y$:\n1. Construct the $N \\times 2$ design matrix $X$, where the $i$-th row is $[1, -T_0/T_i]$.\n2. Compute the normal matrix $M = X^\\top X$.\n3. Calculate the condition number of $M$, $\\mathrm{cond}(M)$, using a standard numerical library function.\n4.

Compute the eigenvalues, $\\lambda_{\\text{min}}, \\lambda_{\\text{max}}$, and corresponding eigenvectors of $\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the laminar flame speed, its sensitivity to thermophysical properties, and an uncertainty analysis, based on a linearized model of a premixed flame. This task will be addressed by first establishing the theoretical framework and then applying it to the provided test cases.\n\n**1. Emergence of the FKPP Equation and Minimal Wave Speed**\n\nWe consider a one-dimensional, steady, planar premixed flame propagating with a laminar speed $S_L$. In a coordinate system moving with the flame, the conservation equation for a generic reaction progress variable, $c$, which varies from $c=0$ in the unburnt mixture to $c=1$ in the burnt products, can be written as:\n$$ \\rho S_L \\frac{d c}{d x} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\Gamma_c \\frac{dc}{dx}\\right) + \\omega_c(c) $$\nwhere $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $\\rho$ is the density, $\\Gamma_c$ is the transport coefficient for $c$, and $\\omega_c$ is the reaction source term for $c$. Assuming constant thermophysical properties, including density $\\rho$ and an effective diffusivity $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, this simplifies to:\n$$ S_L \\frac{d c}{d x} = D_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{d^2 c}{d x^2} + \\frac{\\omega_c(c)}{\\rho} $$\nThe problem is concerned with the leading edge of the flame, where $c \\ll 1$. In this region, the reaction source term $\\omega_c(c)$ can be linearized around the unburnt state ($c=0$). Since there is no reaction in the unburnt mixture, $\\omega_c(0)=0$. The first-order Taylor expansion is $\\omega_c(c) \\approx \\omega_c(0) + c \\cdot \\frac{d\\omega_c}{dc}\\Big|_{c=0} = c \\cdot \\omega_c'(0)$. Let us define a characteristic reaction rate $r$ such that $\\frac{\\omega_c(c)}{\\rho} \\approx r c$ for small $c$. The problem provides this linearized rate as $r = A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E}{R T_u}\\right)$. The governing equation at the flame's leading edge becomes:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{d^2 c}{d x^2} - S_L \\frac{d c}{d x} + r c = 0 $$\nThis is the ordinary differential equation for a steady traveling wave solution to the Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov (FKPP) equation, $\\partial_t c = D_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\partial_{xx} c + r c$. We seek solutions that decay to zero in the unburnt gas, which we assume is at $x \\to +\\infty$. A trial solution of the form $c(x) \\propto e^{-\\lambda x}$ with a positive real decay constant $\\lambda0$ is substituted into the ODE, yielding the characteristic equation:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\lambda^2 + S_L \\lambda + r = 0 $$\nNo, this is incorrect. Let the flame propagate in the $-x$ direction. The moving coordinate is $\\xi=x-S_L t$. Then $\\partial_t \\to -S_L \\frac{d}{d\\xi}$ and $\\partial_x \\to \\frac{d}{d\\xi}$. The PDE becomes $-S_L \\frac{dc}{d\\xi} = D_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{d^2c}{d\\xi^2} + rc$. This gives $D_{\\mathrm{eff}} c'' + S_L c' + rc = 0$. Let the unburnt state be at $\\xi \\to +\\infty$. A solution $c \\propto e^{-\\lambda \\xi}$ gives $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\lambda^2 - S_L\\lambda + r = 0$. For a physically realistic, smooth decaying profile, we require real roots for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{S_L \\pm \\sqrt{S_L^2 - 4 D_{\\mathrm{eff}} r}}{2 D_{\\mathrm{eff}}} $$\nReal roots exist only if the discriminant is non-negative: $S_L^2 - 4 D_{\\mathrm{eff}} r \\ge 0$, which implies $|S_L| \\ge 2\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{eff}} r}$. The minimal possible speed for such a traveling wave, or \"pulled front,\" is given by the equality:\n$$ S_L = 2\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{eff}} r} $$\n\n**2. Effective Diffusion Coefficient, $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**\n\nThe progress variable $c$ is a representation of the state of the gas, which is determined by both its temperature $T$ and its composition (e.g., species mass fractions $Y_i$). The transport of thermal energy is governed by Fourier's law, leading to a thermal diffusivity $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$. The transport of chemical species is governed by Fick's law, leading to a mass diffusivity $D$. The problem asks for a \"symmetric coupling\" of these two diffusion mechanisms. A physically intuitive and mathematically simple symmetric coupling is the arithmetic mean, which corresponds to a scenario where the progress variable is equally sensitive to changes in temperature and species concentration. We therefore define the effective diffusivity as:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\alpha + D}{2} $$\nThe mass diffusivity $D$ is related to the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ via the Schmidt number, $\\mathrm{Sc} = \\mu / (\\rho D)$, so $D=\\mu/(\\rho \\mathrm{Sc})$. Substituting the expressions for $\\alpha$ and $D$:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho \\mathrm{Sc}}\\right) $$\n\n**3. Laminar Flame Speed Expression**\n\nSubstituting the expression for $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ into the minimal speed formula for $S_L$:\n$$ S_L = 2\\sqrt{\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho \\mathrm{Sc}}\\right)\\right] r} = \\sqrt{2r\\left(\\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho \\mathrm{Sc}}\\right)} $$\nThis is the final expression for the nominal laminar flame speed.\n\n**4. Sensitivity Coefficients**\n\nWe now derive the sensitivity of $S_L$ to variations in dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ and thermal conductivity $k$, treating all other parameters as constants.\nThe sensitivity with respect to $\\mu$ is found using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu} \\left[ \\sqrt{2r\\left(\\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho \\mathrm{Sc}}\\right)} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2 S_L} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu} \\left[ 2r\\left(\\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho \\mathrm{Sc}}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2 S_L} \\cdot 2r \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\rho \\mathrm{Sc}} = \\frac{r}{S_L \\rho \\mathrm{Sc}} $$\nSimilarly, the sensitivity with respect to $k$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\left[ \\sqrt{2r\\left(\\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho \\mathrm{Sc}}\\right)} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2 S_L} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k} \\left[ 2r\\left(\\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} + \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho \\mathrm{Sc}}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2 S_L} \\cdot 2r \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\rho c_p} = \\frac{r}{S_L \\rho c_p} $$\n\n**5. First-Order Second-Moment (FOSM) Uncertainty Propagation**\n\nThe variance of $S_L$ due to uncertainties in $\\mu$ and $k$ can be approximated using a first-order Taylor series expansion of $S_L(\\mu, k)$. Assuming $\\mu$ and $k$ are independent random variables with means $\\bar{\\mu}, \\bar{k}$ and variances $\\sigma_\\mu^2, \\sigma_k^2$, the variance of $S_L$ is approximated as:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}[S_L] \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial \\mu}\\bigg|_{\\bar{\\mu}, \\bar{k}}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}[\\mu] + \\left(\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial k}\\bigg|_{\\bar{\\mu}, \\bar{k}}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}[k] $$\nSubstituting the given standard deviations $\\sigma_\\mu$ and $\\sigma_k$:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}[S_L] \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial \\mu}\\right)^2 \\sigma_\\mu^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial k}\\right)^2 \\sigma_k^2 $$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the nominal (mean) parameter values. The standard deviation of the flame speed is then $\\mathrm{Std}[S_L] = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[S_L]}$.\n\n**6. First-Order Sobol Indices**\n\nThe first-order Sobol indices, $S_\\mu$ and $S_k$, quantify the fraction of the total output variance that can be attributed to the variance of each input parameter. Within the FOSM framework, they are defined as the ratio of the partial variance to the total variance:\n$$ S_\\mu = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial \\mu}\\right)^2 \\sigma_\\mu^2}{\\mathrm{Var}[S_L]} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S_k = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\partial S_L}{\\partial k}\\right)^2 \\sigma_k^2}{\\mathrm{Var}[S_L]} $$\nGiven that only $\\mu$ and $k$ are considered uncertain and independent, the sum of these first-order indices is $S_\\mu + S_k = 1$.",
