            "introduction": "The speed of a detonation wave is a critical performance parameter in a Rotating Detonation Engine. This exercise delves into the foundational Chapman-Jouguet theory to explore how different thermodynamic assumptions about the post-shock state—whether the chemical composition is \"frozen\" or has instantly reached \"equilibrium\"—alter the derived wave speed. By working through this problem , you will gain a deeper appreciation for how modeling choices within the idealized Zeldovich-von Neumann-Döring (ZND) framework influence the predicted behavior of the detonation.",

            "problem": "Consider a thin azimuthal wave in a Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE) propagating through a premixed, calorically perfect gas. The premix initially consists of stoichiometric reactants at rest with pressure $p_{0}$, temperature $T_{0}$, specific volume $v_{0}$, density $\\rho_{0} = 1/v_{0}$, and ratio of specific heats $\\gamma_{0}$. The detonation is modeled as a zero-thickness discontinuity obeying the one-dimensional conservation of mass, momentum, and energy with a net specific heat release $q>0$. The wave speed is the Chapman–Jouguet (CJ) speed $D_{CJ}$, and the CJ condition imposes that the flow immediately behind the wave is sonic relative to the wave. Two thermodynamic closures are considered for the state immediately behind the leading shock:\n\n- Frozen composition behind the shock: the post-shock state obeys the reactant equation of state with ratio of specific heats $\\gamma_{\\text{f}}$ (composition frozen during the shock).\n- Equilibrium composition behind the shock: the post-shock state obeys the equilibrium product equation of state with ratio of specific heats $\\gamma_{\\text{e}}$ (composition instantly equilibrated by the shock).\n\nBoth closures use the ideal-gas, calorically perfect relation $e = p v /(\\gamma-1)$ and $h = \\gamma p v /(\\gamma-1)$. Starting from the conservation laws for a steady one-dimensional discontinuity, and the CJ sonic condition, do the following:\n\n1. Carefully explain, in physical and thermodynamic terms, the distinction between frozen and equilibrium compositions behind the shock in the detonation structure of an RDE, and how this distinction alters the equation of state that closes the jump conditions.\n\n2. Using only the fundamental jump relations and the ideal-gas closure, derive the reactive Hugoniot relation for each assumption, expressing the downstream energy in terms of upstream quantities, the downstream pressure $p_{2}$, and specific volume $v_{2}$:\n   - The frozen-composition Hugoniot, in which the downstream internal energy uses $\\gamma_{\\text{f}}$.\n   - The equilibrium-composition Hugoniot, in which the downstream internal energy uses $\\gamma_{\\text{e}}$.\n   Do not introduce any empirical detonation formulas; proceed from the definitions and laws stated above.\n\n3. Impose the CJ sonic condition to eliminate the downstream velocity, and reduce the jump relations to a closed equation for $D_{CJ}$. In the asymptotic regime relevant to strongly exothermic RDE operation, assume $q \\gg p_{0} v_{0}$ so that upstream sensible enthalpy is negligible compared to $q$. Under this assumption, show analytically how the different post-shock $\\gamma$ values lead to different asymptotic CJ speeds $D_{CJ,\\text{f}}$ and $D_{CJ,\\text{e}}$, and obtain a closed-form expression for the ratio $D_{CJ,\\text{f}}/D_{CJ,\\text{e}}$ purely in terms of $\\gamma_{\\text{f}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\text{e}}$.\n\nFinally, evaluate this ratio for a stoichiometric hydrogen–air mixture representative of RDE operation with the following values: $\\gamma_{\\text{f}} = 1.35$ and $\\gamma_{\\text{e}} = 1.25$. Express your final result as a dimensionless number and round your answer to four significant figures. No units should be reported for the ratio.",
            "solution": "The physical distinction is as follows. In a detonation, the leading shock compresses and heats the mixture, and chemical reactions follow in a finite zone behind the shock. Under the frozen-composition assumption behind the shock, the composition is constrained to remain the same as the far-upstream reactants during the shock jump, so the thermodynamic properties (including the ratio of specific heats) of the immediately post-shock state are those of the reactants. Under the equilibrium-composition assumption behind the shock, the shock is considered sufficiently strong that the state immediately behind it has already relaxed to chemical equilibrium, so the thermodynamic properties (including the ratio of specific heats) of that post-shock state are those of the equilibrium products. In both cases, the jump conditions across the thin detonation discontinuity must be closed by an equation of state, and the choice of composition (frozen versus equilibrium) alters the value of $\\gamma$ that enters the thermodynamic relations for internal energy and enthalpy. Because the ratio of specific heats affects the speed of sound, enthalpy, and the shape of the Hugoniot curve in the pressure–specific-volume ($p$–$v$) plane, the CJ point selected by tangency with the Rayleigh line, and hence the CJ speed $D_{CJ}$, will depend on whether the post-shock state is treated as frozen or equilibrium.\n\nWe begin from the one-dimensional, steady conservation laws across a thin reactive discontinuity (shock plus reaction zone collapsed to a surface) in the wave-fixed frame. Let subscripts $0$ denote upstream (unburned, at rest in the lab), and $2$ denote the state immediately behind the detonation discontinuity. The mass, momentum, and energy jump relations are:\n- Mass: $m = \\rho_{0} u_{0} = \\rho_{2} u_{2}$, where $u$ is the velocity in the wave-fixed frame and $m$ is the mass flux. For a wave moving at speed $D$ into quiescent gas, $u_{0} = D$ and $m = \\rho_{0} D$.\n- Momentum: $p_{2} - p_{0} = m^{2} (v_{0} - v_{2})$, with $v = 1/\\rho$ the specific volume.\n- Energy with net heat release $q$ per unit mass: $h_{2} + \\frac{1}{2} u_{2}^{2} = h_{0} + \\frac{1}{2} u_{0}^{2} + q$.\n\nThe reactive Hugoniot is obtained by eliminating velocities in favor of thermodynamic variables using $u_{i} = m v_{i}$ and $h_{i} = e_{i} + p_{i} v_{i}$:\n\n$$\ne_{2} - e_{0} = q + \\frac{1}{2} (p_{2} + p_{0}) (v_{0} - v_{2}).\n$$\n\nThis relation is general; the closure comes from the equation of state for $e$.\n\nFor a calorically perfect ideal gas, $e = p v / (\\gamma - 1)$ and $h = \\gamma p v / (\\gamma - 1)$. The distinction between frozen and equilibrium compositions enters through the value of $\\gamma$ used for the downstream state:\n- Frozen-composition Hugoniot: the downstream internal energy is $e_{2} = p_{2} v_{2} / (\\gamma_{\\text{f}} - 1)$, while the upstream is $e_{0} = p_{0} v_{0} / (\\gamma_{0} - 1)$. The reactive Hugoniot becomes\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{2} v_{2}}{\\gamma_{\\text{f}} - 1} - \\frac{p_{0} v_{0}}{\\gamma_{0} - 1} = q + \\frac{1}{2} (p_{2} + p_{0}) (v_{0} - v_{2}).\n$$\n\n- Equilibrium-composition Hugoniot: the downstream internal energy is $e_{2} = p_{2} v_{2} / (\\gamma_{\\text{e}} - 1)$, giving\n\n$$\n\\frac{p_{2} v_{2}}{\\gamma_{\\text{e}} - 1} - \\frac{p_{0} v_{0}}{\\gamma_{0} - 1} = q + \\frac{1}{2} (p_{2} + p_{0}) (v_{0} - v_{2}).\n$$\n\n\nTo connect to $D_{CJ}$, impose the CJ sonic condition. The downstream velocity relative to the wave is $u_{2} = m v_{2}$, and the downstream sound speed is $c_{2}^{2} = \\gamma_{2} p_{2} / \\rho_{2} = \\gamma_{2} p_{2} v_{2}$ with $\\gamma_{2}$ equal to $\\gamma_{\\text{f}}$ or $\\gamma_{\\text{e}}$ depending on the closure. The CJ condition is $u_{2} = c_{2}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\nm^{2} v_{2}^{2} = \\gamma_{2} p_{2} v_{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad p_{2} = \\frac{m^{2} v_{2}}{\\gamma_{2}}.\n$$\n\nCombine this with the Rayleigh line $p_{2} - p_{0} = m^{2} (v_{0} - v_{2})$ to eliminate $p_{2}$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{m^{2} v_{2}}{\\gamma_{2}} - p_{0} = m^{2} (v_{0} - v_{2}) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad v_{2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{2}}{\\gamma_{2} + 1} \\left( v_{0} + \\frac{p_{0}}{m^{2}} \\right).\n$$\n\nThe detonation speed is related to the mass flux by $m = \\rho_{0} D$, so $m^{2} = \\rho_{0}^{2} D^{2} = D^{2}/v_{0}^{2}$. Using $h_{2} = \\gamma_{2} p_{2} v_{2} / (\\gamma_{2} - 1) = m^{2} v_{2}^{2} / (\\gamma_{2} - 1)$ and $u_{2}^{2} = m^{2} v_{2}^{2}$, the energy jump becomes\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{2} - 1} + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) m^{2} v_{2}^{2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{0}}{\\gamma_{0} - 1} p_{0} v_{0} + \\frac{1}{2} D^{2} + q.\n$$\n\nSubstituting $m^{2} = D^{2}/v_{0}^{2}$ and $v_{2} = \\frac{\\gamma_{2}}{\\gamma_{2} + 1} \\left( v_{0} + \\frac{p_{0} v_{0}^{2}}{D^{2}} \\right)$ yields a closed equation in $D^{2}$. After algebraic reduction, this can be written as a quadratic in $D^{2}$:\n\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{1}{2(\\gamma_{2}^{2} - 1)} \\right] D^{4} + \\left[ \\frac{\\gamma_{2}^{2}}{\\gamma_{2}^{2} - 1} p_{0} v_{0} - \\frac{\\gamma_{0}}{\\gamma_{0} - 1} p_{0} v_{0} - q \\right] D^{2} + \\left[ \\frac{\\gamma_{2}^{2}}{2(\\gamma_{2}^{2} - 1)} p_{0}^{2} v_{0}^{2} \\right] = 0.\n$$\n\nIn the strongly exothermic limit $q \\gg p_{0} v_{0}$ (typical for practical RDE operation, where $q$ is orders of magnitude larger than $p_{0} v_{0} = R_{0} T_{0}$), the terms proportional to $p_{0} v_{0}$ and $p_{0}^{2} v_{0}^{2}$ are negligible compared to $q$, and the quadratic simplifies asymptotically to\n\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{1}{2(\\gamma_{2}^{2} - 1)} \\right] D^{4} - q D^{2} \\approx 0.\n$$\n\nDiscarding the trivial root $D=0$, the asymptotic CJ speed is\n\n$$\nD_{CJ}^{2} \\approx 2 (\\gamma_{2}^{2} - 1) \\, q.\n$$\n\nThis expression shows explicitly that the asymptotic CJ speed depends on the post-shock ratio of specific heats $\\gamma_{2}$, which differs between the frozen and equilibrium closures.
