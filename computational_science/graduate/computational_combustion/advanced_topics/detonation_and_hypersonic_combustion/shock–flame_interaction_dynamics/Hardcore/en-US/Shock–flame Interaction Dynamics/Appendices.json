            "problem": "A planar, steady, one-dimensional normal shock forms ahead of a premixed laminar flame propagating into an unburned methane–air mixture. The unburned mixture upstream of the shock has pressure $p_1 = 101.325 \\text{ kPa}$ and temperature $T_1 = 300 \\text{ K}$. Treat the mixture as a calorically perfect gas with constant specific heat ratio $\\gamma = 1.4$ and ideal-gas behavior. The upstream Mach number is $M_1 = 2.0$. Immediately behind the shock, the gas is still unreacted and remains a single ideal-gas mixture characterized by $(p_2, T_2)$.\n\nStarting from the steady, one-dimensional conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy across a normal shock, together with the ideal-gas constitutive relations, derive expressions for the post-shock pressure $p_2$ and temperature $T_2$ in terms of $(p_1, T_1, M_1, \\gamma)$, and then evaluate $p_2$ and $T_2$ for the given numerical conditions. Assume no heat addition or work across the shock and neglect any chemical reaction or species change across the shock.\n\nTo estimate the impact on the laminar flame speed $S_L$, adopt the empirical scaling $S_L \\propto T^n$ and ignore any direct pressure dependence over the narrow range of conditions considered. Use $n = 1.7$ and compute the ratio $S_{L,2}/S_{L,1}$, where $S_{L,1}$ is the upstream laminar flame speed at $T_1$ and $S_{L,2}$ is the laminar flame speed the flame would have if it immediately encountered the post-shock temperature $T_2$.\n\nExpress $p_2$ in kilopascals (kPa), $T_2$ in kelvins (K), and $S_{L,2}/S_{L,1}$ as a pure number. Round all reported quantities to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of post-shock pressure and temperature from fundamental principles and their subsequent numerical evaluation, followed by the calculation of a laminar flame speed ratio based on an empirical temperature scaling.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady, one-dimensional conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy across a stationary normal shock wave. For a control volume enclosing the shock, these are:\nMass conservation:\n$$ \\rho_1 u_1 = \\rho_2 u_2 $$\nMomentum conservation:\n$$ p_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 = p_2 + \\rho_2 u_2^2 $$\nEnergy conservation:\n$$ h_1 + \\frac{1}{2} u_1^2 = h_2 + \\frac{1}{2} u_2^2 $$\nHere, subscripts $1$ and $2$ denote conditions upstream (unburned, preshock) and downstream (unburned, post-shock) of the shock, respectively. The variables $\\rho$, $u$, $p$, and $h$ represent density, fluid velocity, pressure, and specific enthalpy.\n\nThe mixture is treated as a calorically perfect ideal gas. The relevant constitutive relations are:\nIdeal-gas law: $p = \\rho R T$\nSpecific enthalpy: $h = c_p T$\nSpecific heat relation: $c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1}$\nSpeed of sound: $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$\nMach number: $M = u/a$\nwhere $T$ is temperature, $R$ is the specific gas constant, $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $\\gamma$ is the specific heat ratio.\n\nThe energy equation implies that the stagnation enthalpy $h_0 = h + \\frac{1}{2}u^2$ is conserved, $h_{01} = h_{02}$. This also means stagnation temperature $T_0$ is conserved. The stagnation temperature is related to the static temperature by $T_0 = T(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M^2)$. Thus, we have:\n$$ T_1\\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2\\right) = T_2\\left(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_2^2\\right) $$\nThis yields an expression for the temperature ratio in terms of the Mach numbers:\n$$ \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_2^2} $$\nThe momentum equation can be rewritten by factoring out the pressure and using the relation $\\rho u^2 = \\rho a^2 M^2 = (\\gamma p) M^2$:\n$$ p_1(1 + \\gamma M_1^2) = p_2(1 + \\gamma M_2^2) $$\nThis gives the pressure ratio in terms of Mach numbers:\n$$ \\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2}{1 + \\gamma M_2^2} $$\nTo find an expression dependent only on upstream conditions, we must relate $M_2$ to $M_1$. We can combine the continuity equation, $\\rho_1 u_1 = \\rho_2 u_2$, with the ideal-gas law and the definitions of Mach number and speed of sound:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{R T_1} (M_1 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_1}) = \\frac{p_2}{R T_2} (M_2 \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_2}) $$\n$$ \\frac{p_1 M_1}{\\sqrt{T_1}} = \\frac{p_2 M_2}{\\sqrt{T_2}} \\implies \\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\left(\\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{M_2}{M_1}\\right)^2 $$\nSubstituting the previously derived expressions for the temperature and pressure ratios into this equation establishes a relationship solely between $M_1$ and $M_2$:\n$$ \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_1^2}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M_2^2} = \\left(\\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2}{1 + \\gamma M_2^2}\\right)^2 \\frac{M_2^2}{M_1^2} $$\nThis equation has a trivial solution $M_1^2 = M_2^2$ (no shock) and a second solution that describes the property changes across a shock. After algebraic manipulation, the second solution is found to be:\n$$ M_2^2 = \\frac{M_1^2 + \\frac{2}{\\gamma-1}}{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}M_1^2 - 1} $$\nNow we substitute this expression for $M_2^2$ back into the pressure ratio formula:\n$$ \\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2}{1 + \\gamma M_2^2} = \\frac{1 + \\gamma M_1^2}{1 + \\gamma \\left(\\frac{M_1^2 + \\frac{2}{\\gamma-1}}{\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma-1}M_1^2 - 1}\\right)} $$\nSimplifying the denominator and the overall expression yields the Rankine-Hugoniot relation for pressure:\n$$ \\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \\frac{2\\gamma M_1^2 - (\\gamma-1)}{\\gamma+1} $$\nTo find the temperature ratio, we use the relationship $\\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2}$. The density ratio $\\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1}$ across a normal shock is given by $\\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1} = \\frac{(\\gamma+1)M_1^2}{(\\gamma-1)M_1^2+2}$.
