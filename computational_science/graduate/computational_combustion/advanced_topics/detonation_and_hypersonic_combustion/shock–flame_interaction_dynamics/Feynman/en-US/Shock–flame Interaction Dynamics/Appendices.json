            "problem": "A planar, steady, one-dimensional normal shock forms ahead of a premixed laminar flame propagating into an unburned methane–air mixture. The unburned mixture upstream of the shock has pressure $p_1 = 101.325 \\text{ kPa}$ and temperature $T_1 = 300 \\text{ K}$. Treat the mixture as a calorically perfect gas with constant specific heat ratio $\\gamma = 1.4$ and ideal-gas behavior. The upstream Mach number is $M_1 = 2.0$. Immediately behind the shock, the gas is still unreacted and remains a single ideal-gas mixture characterized by ($p_2, T_2$).\n\nStarting from the steady, one-dimensional conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy across a normal shock, together with the ideal-gas constitutive relations, derive expressions for the post-shock pressure $p_2$ and temperature $T_2$ in terms of ($p_1, T_1, M_1, \\gamma$), and then evaluate $p_2$ and $T_2$ for the given numerical conditions. Assume no heat addition or work across the shock and neglect any chemical reaction or species change across the shock.\n\nTo estimate the impact on the laminar flame speed $S_L$, adopt the empirical scaling $S_L \\propto T^n$ and ignore any direct pressure dependence over the narrow range of conditions considered. Use $n = 1.7$ and compute the ratio $S_{L,2}/S_{L,1}$, where $S_{L,1}$ is the upstream laminar flame speed at $T_1$ and $S_{L,2}$ is the laminar flame speed the flame would have if it immediately encountered the post-shock temperature $T_2$.\n\nExpress $p_2$ in kilopascals (kPa), $T_2$ in kelvins (K), and $S_{L,2}/S_{L,1}$ as a pure number.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of post-shock pressure and temperature from fundamental principles and their subsequent numerical evaluation, followed by the calculation of a laminar flame speed ratio based on an empirical temperature scaling.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady, one-dimensional conservation laws for mass, momentum, and energy across a stationary normal shock wave. For a control volume enclosing the shock, these are:\nMass conservation:\n$$ \\rho_1 u_1 = \\rho_2 u_2 $$\nMomentum conservation:\n$$ p_1 + \\rho_1 u_1^2 = p_2 + \\rho_2 u_2^2 $$\nEnergy conservation:\n$$ h_1 + \\frac{1}{2} u_1^2 = h_2 + \\frac{1}{2} u_2^2 $$\nHere, subscripts $1$ and $2$ denote conditions upstream (unburned, preshock) and downstream (unburned, post-shock) of the shock, respectively. The variables $\\rho$, $u$, $p$, and $h$ represent density, fluid velocity, pressure, and specific enthalpy.\n\nThe mixture is treated as a calorically perfect ideal gas.

This also means stagnation temperature $T_0$ is conserved. The stagnation temperature is related to the static temperature by $T_0 = T(1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2}M^2)$.

The left eigenvector is $\\mathbf{l}_1^T = [1, -\\rho_b a_b]$. The corresponding characteristic variable, which must be set to zero at $x=L$ for a nonreflecting condition, is $W_{in} = \\mathbf{l}_1^T \\mathbf{q}'$.\n$$\nW_{in}(L,t) = p'(L,t) - \\rho_b a_b u'(L,t) = 0\n$$\nFor the problem setup, the perturbations are defined as $p'(L,t) = p(L,t) - p_b$ and $u'(L,t) = u(L,t) - U_b$. The nonreflecting condition is therefore:\n$$\np(L,t) - p_b = \\rho_b a_b \\left( u(L,t) - U_b \\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a boundary condition of the Robin type:\n$$\np(L,t) - p_b = Z \\left( u(L,t) - U_b \\right)\n$$\nBy direct comparison of these two forms, we identify the boundary impedance $Z$ as:\n$$\nZ = \\rho_b a_b\n$$\nThe problem requires $Z$ to be expressed in terms of $\\gamma$, $\\rho_b$, and $p_b$. We substitute the given relation for the speed of sound, $a_b = \\sqrt{\\gamma p_b / \\rho_b}$:\n$$\nZ = \\rho_b \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma p_b}{\\rho_b}} = \\sqrt{\\rho_b^2 \\frac{\\gamma p_b}{\\rho_b}} = \\sqrt{\\gamma \\rho_b p_b}\n$$\nThis quantity, $\\rho a$, is the characteristic acoustic impedance of the medium. Setting the boundary impedance $Z$ equal to the characteristic impedance of the medium ensures that outgoing waves are perfectly absorbed without reflection.\n\nThe units of $Z$ are those of density multiplied by velocity, i.e., $(\\text{kg}/\\text{m}^3) \\cdot (\\text{m}/\\text{s}) = \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$. A Pascal is $1\\ \\text{Pa} = 1\\ \\text{N}/\\text{m}^2 = 1\\ (\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2)/\\text{m}^2 = \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$. Therefore, the unit $\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}/\\text{m}$ is $(\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}) \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1} = \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$. The units are consistent with the requested SI units of $\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}/\\text{m}$.\nThe boundary condition $p' = Z u'$ with the derived $Z$ is homogeneous in the perturbations and is therefore fully consistent with preserving the specified mean state, for which $p'=0$ and $u'=0$.",
