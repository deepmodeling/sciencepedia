The problem defines this as the ratio of the rise in the progress variable between $c_1=0.1$ and $c_2=0.9$ to the maximum magnitude of the spatial gradient of $c$.

The kernel remains nearly spherical, and the local consumption speed is extracted from species transport across the flame surface.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to proceed with a solution. The concepts presented—Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS), premixed flame kernels, flame stretch, Markstein length, and thermal flame thickness—are standard and well-defined within the field of combustion science. The provided values are physically realistic for the specified mixture conditions.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the dimensionless Markstein number, $M$, and explain its physical significance in the context of flame stretch sensitivity.\n\nThe dimensionless Markstein number, $M$, is defined as the ratio of the Markstein length, $L_M$, to a characteristic flame thickness. In this problem, the thermal flame thickness, $\\delta_L$, is provided and serves as the appropriate length scale for normalization. The definition is thus:\n$$\nM = \\frac{L_M}{\\delta_L}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values obtained from the DNS analysis:\nThe Markstein length, $L_M = 0.92\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe thermal flame thickness, $\\delta_L = 0.31\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition yields:\n$$\nM = \\frac{0.92\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{0.31\\ \\mathrm{mm}} \\approx 2.96774...\n$$\nAs per the instruction to round the result to four significant figures, the Markstein number is:\n$$\nM \\approx 2.968\n$$\nSince both $L_M$ and $\\delta_L$ have units of length, $M$ is a dimensionless quantity as required.\n\nThe second part of the task is to explain how the sign and magnitude of $M$ relate to the sensitivity of the laminar burning velocity, $S_L$, to flame stretch, $K$, in the small stretch limit ($K \\to 0$). This relationship is rooted in the first-order asymptotic analysis of stretched flames. For small values of $K$, the response of the burning velocity (or consumption speed, $S_c$, which is nearly identical to $S_L$ for low stretch) is linear. The relationship is conventionally expressed using the Markstein length, $L_M$:\n$$\nS_{L,K} - S_L^0 \\approx -L_M K\n$$\nwhere $S_{L,K}$ is the burning velocity of the stretched flame and $S_L^0$ is the burning velocity of a planar, unstretched flame ($K=0$).\n\nBy substituting the definition $L_M = M \\delta_L$, this relationship becomes:\n$$\nS_{L,K} - S_L^0 \\approx -M \\delta_L K\n$$\nThis equation directly links the change in burning velocity to the Markstein number $M$.\n\n**Significance of the Sign of $M$**:\nThe sign of $M$ dictates the qualitative response of the flame to stretch. In this problem, $M \\approx 2.968$, which is a positive value. For an expanding spherical flame kernel, the flame front is convex towards the unburned gas, and the stretch rate $K$ is positive ($K0$). Therefore, the change in burning velocity is:\n$$\nS_{L,K} - S_L^0 \\approx -(+) \\cdot (+) \\cdot (+)  0\n$$\nThis implies that $S_{L,K}  S_L^0$. A positive Markstein number signifies that the burning velocity decreases under positive stretch. Such flames are considered stable with respect to stretch-induced wrinkling. This behavior is characteristic of premixed flames with an effective Lewis number greater than unity ($Le_{eff}  1$). The Lewis number, $Le$, is the ratio of thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity of a species. For a lean methane-air flame ($\\phi=0.80$), the deficient reactant is oxygen, but the overall diffusive-thermal effects, influenced by all species including products, result in $Le_{eff}  1$. This means that heat tends to diffuse away from a positively curved flame front faster than reactants diffuse into it, leading to a local cooling, a lower reaction rate, and thus a reduced burning velocity. A negative Markstein number ($M0$) would imply $S_{L,K}  S_L^0$ for $K0$, indicating an enhancement of burning velocity by stretch, which is a destabilizing effect characteristic of flames with $Le_{eff}  1$.\n\n**Significance of the Magnitude of $M$**:\nThe magnitude of $M$ quantifies the sensitivity of the flame to stretch. A larger value of $|M|$ indicates a stronger response of the burning velocity to a given rate of stretch. The value $M \\approx 2.968$ is a moderately large positive number, indicating that this lean methane-air flame is quite sensitive to stretch, with its burning velocity being significantly suppressed as the flame kernel expands and the associated stretch rate is non-zero.\n\nIn summary, the calculated positive Markstein number $M \\approx 2.968$ indicates that the burning velocity of the specified methane-air flame is reduced by flame stretch, a characteristic feature of mixtures with an effective Lewis number greater than $1$. The magnitude of $M$ shows a significant sensitivity to this effect.",

            "solution": "The first task is to derive an expression for the local scalar dissipation rate, $\\chi$. The scalar dissipation rate is defined as the rate at which mixture fraction variance, conventionally taken as $Z^2$, is destroyed by molecular diffusion. We start with the transport equation for a passive scalar $Z$, assuming constant density $\\rho$ and diffusivity $D$ for simplicity of derivation, though the final expression holds more generally for the instantaneous field:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla Z = D \\nabla^2 Z\n$$\nTo find the transport equation for the quantity $Z^2$, we multiply the above equation by $2Z$:\n$$\n2Z\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial t} + 2Z(\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla Z) = 2Z(D \\nabla^2 Z)\n$$\nUsing the identities $\\frac{\\partial (Z^2)}{\\partial t} = 2Z\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial t}$ and $\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla(Z^2) = 2Z(\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla Z)$, the left-hand side becomes the material derivative of $Z^2$. The equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (Z^2)}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla(Z^2) = 2D Z \\nabla^2 Z\n$$\nThe term on the right-hand side represents the effect of molecular diffusion on the quantity $Z^2$. We can rewrite this term using the vector identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\phi \\boldsymbol{A}) = \\phi (\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{A}) + \\boldsymbol{A} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi$. Let $\\phi = Z$ and $\\boldsymbol{A} = \\nabla Z$. Then $\\nabla \\cdot (Z \\nabla Z) = Z \\nabla^2 Z + |\\nabla Z|^2$. Rearranging gives $Z \\nabla^2 Z = \\nabla \\cdot (Z \\nabla Z) - |\\nabla Z|^2$. Substituting this into the equation for $Z^2$ transport:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (Z^2)}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla(Z^2) = 2D (\\nabla \\cdot (Z \\nabla Z) - |\\nabla Z|^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (Z^2)}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla(Z^2) = \\nabla \\cdot (2D Z \\nabla Z) - 2D |\\nabla Z|^2\n$$\nThis is the transport equation for $Z^2$. The term $\\nabla \\cdot (2D Z \\nabla Z)$ is a diffusive transport term, which redistributes $Z^2$ in space. The term $-2D |\\nabla Z|^2$ is a source/sink term. Since $D  0$ and $|\\nabla Z|^2 \\ge 0$, this term is always non-positive, acting as a sink. It represents the irreversible destruction of scalar variance by molecular mixing.

It quantifies the rate of molecular mixing at the smallest scales of the flow (the Batchelor scale).\n1.  **Influence on Flame Thickness**: The scalar dissipation rate is related to the magnitude of the mixture fraction gradient, $\\chi = 2D|\\nabla Z|^2$. The physical thickness of the mixing layer, $\\delta_L$, can be defined as the scale over which $Z$ varies, so $\\delta_L \\sim 1/|\\nabla Z|$. This implies a relationship between the flame thickness and $\\chi$: $|\\nabla Z| = \\sqrt{\\chi/(2D)}$, and thus $\\delta_L \\sim \\sqrt{2D/\\chi}$. A higher scalar dissipation rate implies steeper gradients and consequently a thinner flame structure in physical space. The reaction zone becomes more compressed.\n\n2.  **Influence on Local Extinction**: Combustion is a competition between the rate of chemical reaction and the rate of transport processes. The scalar dissipation rate represents the inverse of a characteristic diffusion/mixing time, $\\tau_{mix} \\sim 1/\\chi$. Local flame extinction occurs when this mixing time becomes comparable to or shorter than the characteristic chemical reaction time, $\\tau_{chem}$. This competition is quantified by the Damköhler number, $Da = \\tau_{mix}/\\tau_{chem} \\propto 1/(\\chi \\tau_{chem})$.\n   A very high value of $\\chi$ leads to a very small mixing time and a low Damköhler number ($Da \\ll 1$). Under these conditions, reactants (fuel and oxidizer) are mixed and transported away from the reaction zone so rapidly that they do not have sufficient residence time to react and release heat. The heat release rate can no longer balance the heat loss rate (primarily through convection and diffusion), and the flame locally extinguishes. Flamelet theory predicts a critical value of scalar dissipation, the quenching dissipation rate $\\chi_q$, beyond which a steady flame structure cannot be sustained. If the local instantaneous $\\chi$ exceeds $\\chi_q$, particularly at the stoichiometric surface where heat release is maximal, local extinction occurs. The location specified in the problem, a jet shear layer, is characterized by intense turbulence, which generates large fluctuations in $\\chi$ and frequently leads to such extinction events.",
