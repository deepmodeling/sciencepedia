## Introduction
The widespread adoption of [lithium-ion batteries](@entry_id:150991) has revolutionized energy storage, but their high energy density also presents a significant safety challenge: thermal runaway. This catastrophic failure mode, characterized by a rapid, self-accelerating temperature rise, can lead to cell rupture, fire, and even explosion. To engineer safer battery systems, from consumer electronics to electric vehicles, a deep, physics-based understanding of this phenomenon is not just beneficial—it is essential. The core knowledge gap lies in bridging fundamental thermochemical principles with predictive engineering models that can accurately forecast the onset and consequences of thermal runaway.

This article provides a graduate-level exposition on the modeling of [battery thermal runaway](@entry_id:267438) and combustion. It is structured to build knowledge systematically, from foundational principles to complex applications. In "Principles and Mechanisms," we will dissect the core physics of thermal runaway, examining the heat sources, the kinetic hierarchy of decomposition reactions, and the classical theories that govern [thermal stability](@entry_id:157474). Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate how these theories are implemented in computational models to analyze cell stability, predict inter-cell propagation, and assess the fire and explosion hazards of vented gases. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will provide opportunities to apply these concepts to solve practical engineering problems, solidifying your understanding of this critical subject. Our exploration begins with the fundamental principles that underpin this complex and crucial area of safety engineering.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The phenomenon of thermal runaway in a lithium-ion battery is a complex interplay of electrochemical, thermal, and chemical processes. To construct predictive models for safety analysis and system design, a firm understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms is essential. This chapter deconstructs the progression of thermal runaway, beginning with the fundamental sources of heat within the cell, proceeding to the kinetic mechanisms that drive [thermal instability](@entry_id:151762), and concluding with the theoretical frameworks used to analyze and model this critical safety issue.

### Fundamental Heat Sources in a Lithium-Ion Cell

Under normal operation, a lithium-ion cell generates a modest amount of heat that is typically managed by the battery's thermal management system. During abuse conditions, however, these heat sources can intensify and be augmented by new, highly exothermic decomposition reactions. A comprehensive understanding of thermal behavior begins with an energy balance on the cell, treated as a [thermodynamic control](@entry_id:151582) volume. The first law of thermodynamics, neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energy, states that the rate of change in the cell's internal energy is equal to the net rate of [heat and work](@entry_id:144159) transfer across its boundary. For an [electrochemical cell](@entry_id:147644), the primary work term is electrical work, $VI$, where $V$ is the terminal voltage and $I$ is the current (defined as positive for discharge). The total heat generation rate, $\dot{Q}_{total}$, can be derived from [electrochemical thermodynamics](@entry_id:264154) and is conventionally decomposed into three principal components: irreversible Joule heating, reversible [entropic heating](@entry_id:1124552), and chemical reaction heating .

$$
\dot{Q}_{total} = \dot{Q}_{Joule} + \dot{Q}_{ent} + \dot{Q}_{rxn}
$$

A rigorous derivation yields the following expression for the heat generated by the main electrochemical process:
$$
\dot{Q}_{gen} = I(E-V) - IT\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}
$$
Here, $E$ is the cell's equilibrium open-circuit voltage (OCV), and $T$ is the [absolute temperature](@entry_id:144687). To this, we add the heat from parasitic side reactions, $\dot{Q}_{rxn}$, to obtain the total heat generation. Let us examine each of these terms in detail.

#### Irreversible Joule Heating

The first term, **Joule heating**, is given by:
$$
\dot{Q}_{Joule} = I(E-V)
$$
This represents all irreversible energy dissipation within the cell. The difference between the [equilibrium potential](@entry_id:166921) $E$ and the operating voltage $V$ is the **total overpotential**, $\eta_{total} = E-V$ for discharge. This overpotential is the driving force needed to overcome the various resistances to current flow, including the electronic resistance of the current collectors, the ionic resistance of the electrolyte, and the charge-transfer resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces. An equivalent and more familiar expression for Joule heating is $\dot{Q}_{Joule} = I^2R_{int}$, where $R_{int} = (E-V)/I$ is the effective internal resistance of the cell.

The magnitude of Joule heating is strongly dependent on both temperature and state of charge (SOC) .
*   **Temperature Dependence**: The primary contributors to internal resistance, such as the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte and the kinetics of [charge transfer](@entry_id:150374), are highly sensitive to temperature. Within the normal operating range, ionic conductivity in [liquid electrolytes](@entry_id:1127330) increases with temperature, and charge-[transfer reactions](@entry_id:159934) become faster. Both effects lead to a *decrease* in internal resistance as temperature rises. Consequently, for a fixed current, Joule heating tends to decrease with increasing temperature.
*   **SOC Dependence**: The material properties that determine $R_{int}$, such as the electronic conductivity of the electrode active materials and [solid-state diffusion](@entry_id:161559) coefficients, are strong functions of their degree of lithiation. Therefore, the internal resistance and the resulting Joule heat generation vary significantly throughout a charge or discharge cycle.

#### Reversible Entropic Heating

The second term, **[entropic heating](@entry_id:1124552)**, arises from the reversible [entropy change](@entry_id:138294) of the primary cell reaction. Its contribution to the overall heat generation rate is:
$$
\dot{Q}_{ent} = -IT\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}
$$
The quantity $\partial E/\partial T$ is known as the **entropic heat coefficient**. It represents the change in the cell's [equilibrium potential](@entry_id:166921) with temperature at a fixed composition (i.e., fixed SOC) . This term's origin lies in the fundamental thermodynamic relationship $\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$. For a reversible electrochemical reaction, the change in Gibbs free energy is $\Delta G = -nFE$, and the entropy of reaction can be shown to be $\Delta S = nF(\partial E/\partial T)$. The reversible heat exchanged with the surroundings is $T\Delta S$, and the rate of this heat exchange is proportional to the reaction rate, which is in turn proportional to the current $I$.

Unlike Joule heating, which is always positive (exothermic), [entropic heating](@entry_id:1124552) can be either positive or negative:
*   If $\partial E/\partial T > 0$, the entropic term is negative during discharge ($I>0$), resulting in a **cooling** effect (endothermic).
*   If $\partial E/\partial T  0$, the entropic term is positive during discharge, resulting in an additional **heating** effect (exothermic).

The entropic heat coefficient is a strong function of SOC because the partial molar entropy of lithium within the electrode host materials, particularly the [configurational entropy](@entry_id:147820) component, depends heavily on the lithium concentration. As a result, $\partial E/\partial T$ can vary significantly and even change sign over the course of a single discharge cycle. While often smaller than Joule heating at high currents, [entropic heating](@entry_id:1124552) is a critical component of accurate thermal modeling, especially at low to moderate charge/discharge rates.

#### Chemical Reaction Heating

The third term, **reaction heating** ($\dot{Q}_{rxn}$), encompasses all heat generated by unintended parasitic or decomposition side reactions. It is given by the sum of the rates of each [side reaction](@entry_id:271170), $r_i$, multiplied by their respective enthalpies of reaction, $(-\Delta H_i)$:
$$
\dot{Q}_{rxn} = \sum_i r_i (-\Delta H_i)
$$
Under normal operating conditions, this term is negligible. However, under abuse conditions such as overheating, it becomes the dominant and most dangerous source of heat. The rates of these chemical reactions are governed by the **Arrhenius law**, which describes their exponential dependence on temperature. This is the fundamental mechanism that enables the positive feedback loop of thermal runaway.

### The Onset and Escalation of Thermal Runaway

Thermal runaway is initiated when the rate of heat generation within a cell exceeds the rate at which heat can be dissipated to the surroundings. This imbalance leads to a temperature rise, which, due to the nature of chemical kinetics, can lead to a catastrophic, self-accelerating thermal event.

#### The Arrhenius Law and Thermal Sensitivity

The rate of a thermally activated chemical reaction is typically described by the Arrhenius equation:
$$
k(T) = A \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{RT}\right)
$$
where $k(T)$ is the rate constant, $A$ is the [pre-exponential factor](@entry_id:145277), $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the [universal gas constant](@entry_id:136843), and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

To understand the onset of runaway, consider a simple **[lumped thermal model](@entry_id:1127534)** of a battery cell, where the entire cell is at a single uniform temperature $T$. The energy balance can be written as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) :
$$
C \frac{dT}{dt} = \dot{Q}_{gen}(T) - \dot{Q}_{loss}(T)
$$
where $C$ is the cell's total heat capacity. The heat loss term is often modeled by Newton's law of cooling, $\dot{Q}_{loss} = hA_s(T - T_\infty)$, where $h$ is the heat [transfer coefficient](@entry_id:264443), $A_s$ is the surface area, and $T_\infty$ is the ambient temperature. The heat generation term, dominated by decomposition reactions at high temperatures, is proportional to the Arrhenius rate: $\dot{Q}_{gen}(T) \propto \exp(-E_a/RT)$.

The critical feature leading to thermal runaway is the disparity between the functional forms of generation and loss. Heat loss increases linearly with temperature, while heat generation increases exponentially. At low temperatures, heat loss dominates. As temperature rises, heat generation can increase so rapidly that it surpasses heat loss, leading to a net positive heat accumulation ($dT/dt  0$). This further increases the temperature, which in turn causes an even faster rate of heat generation. This powerful **positive feedback loop** is the essence of thermal runaway.

The sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature is a crucial concept. It can be quantified by the [logarithmic derivative](@entry_id:169238) of the rate constant :
$$
\frac{d\ln k}{dT} = \frac{E_a}{RT^2}
$$
This expression shows that reactions with a **high activation energy $E_a$** are exceptionally sensitive to changes in temperature. Even a small increase in temperature can cause a massive increase in the reaction rate and, consequently, the heat generation rate. This extreme temperature sensitivity is a defining characteristic of the reactions that drive thermal runaway. A more general stability analysis, known as a Semenov analysis, shows that runaway is initiated when the *gradient* of the heat generation curve exceeds the *gradient* of the heat loss line. This leads to an instability criterion of the form $\dot{Q}_{gen}(T_0) \frac{E_a}{RT_0^2}  hA_s$, explicitly showing the importance of $E_a$ in determining the threshold for runaway  .

#### The Kinetic Hierarchy of Decomposition Reactions

Thermal runaway is not a single event but a cascade of sequential [exothermic reactions](@entry_id:199674). As the battery's temperature rises, different components begin to decompose at different temperatures, dictated by their respective thermal stabilities and activation energies. For a typical charged lithium-ion cell with a [graphite anode](@entry_id:269569) and a metal-oxide cathode (e.g., NMC), the sequence of events is well-established :

1.  **SEI Decomposition:** The Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) layer on the surface of the graphite anode is the least thermally stable component. Its decomposition is exothermic and typically initiates at the lowest temperatures, often in the range of $90^\circ\mathrm{C}$ to $120^\circ\mathrm{C}$. The heat generated is relatively modest but is critical because it raises the cell temperature to the point where more severe reactions can begin.

2.  **Anode and Electrolyte Reactions:** Once the protective SEI layer is compromised, the highly reactive lithiated graphite is exposed to the electrolyte. This triggers further [exothermic reactions](@entry_id:199674), often starting around $140^\circ\mathrm{C}$ to $180^\circ\mathrm{C}$.

3.  **Cathode Decomposition and Oxygen Release:** At even higher temperatures, typically above $200^\circ\mathrm{C}$ for NMC cathodes, the cathode active material itself becomes unstable and decomposes. A critical consequence of this decomposition is the release of gaseous oxygen from the oxide lattice.

4.  **Electrolyte Oxidation:** The oxygen released by the cathode acts as a powerful oxidant that reacts violently with the flammable organic electrolyte solvents. This is effectively an internal combustion event, which generates a tremendous amount of heat and gas, leading to the most rapid temperature rise and the highest risk of cell rupture and fire.

This sequence is governed by the relative activation energies of the processes, with the ordering typically being $E_{a, \text{SEI}}  E_{a, \text{electrolyte}}  E_{a, \text{cathode}}$ . We can illustrate this principle with a simplified kinetic model . Consider three processes—SEI oxidation, solvent decomposition, and cathode-driven oxidation—each with its own Arrhenius parameters. The [onset temperature](@entry_id:197328) $T_i$ for each process can be defined as the temperature at which its heat generation rate reaches a certain critical value $C$. This condition gives the relation:
$$
T_i = \frac{E_i}{R \ln\left(\frac{Q_i A_i}{C}\right)}
$$
where $Q_i$ is a heat [release factor](@entry_id:174698). Using plausible parameters, one can calculate that despite large differences in the pre-exponential factors $A_i$, the ordering of onset temperatures ($T_1  T_2  T_3$) is primarily determined by the ordering of the activation energies ($E_1  E_2  E_3$). The lowest [activation energy barrier](@entry_id:275556) is overcome first, initiating the runaway cascade.

#### Modeling Runaway Dynamics: n-th Order vs. Autocatalytic Kinetics

Accurate modeling of the reaction progress is crucial. While simple $n$-th order kinetics can be used, they often fail to capture a key feature of observed battery runaway: a long, slow **[induction period](@entry_id:901770)** followed by an abrupt, almost explosive, temperature rise.

A more physically representative model for many solid-state decomposition reactions is **autocatalytic kinetics**. In this model, the reaction rate depends not only on temperature but also on the amount of product already formed, as the product itself can catalyze further reaction. For a reaction progress variable $\alpha$ (from 0 to 1), the rate can be modeled as:
$$
\frac{d\alpha}{dt} \approx k(T)\alpha \quad (\text{for small } \alpha)
$$
Linear stability analysis of a system with autocatalytic kinetics reveals a crucial difference from simple $n$-th order models . The system possesses an inherently unstable chemical mode with a positive eigenvalue equal to the rate constant, $k(T_a)$. At ambient temperature $T_a$, $k(T_a)$ is extremely small due to the Arrhenius factor. This means the reaction progress $\alpha$ grows, but at an almost imperceptibly slow rate, leading to a long [induction period](@entry_id:901770) where the temperature remains near ambient. However, once $\alpha$ becomes large enough to generate significant heat, the temperature begins to rise, exponentially increasing $k(T)$ and triggering the rapid positive feedback loop. This two-stage behavior—a long, slow buildup followed by a sudden escalation—is a hallmark of autocatalytic systems and aligns much better with experimental observations of [battery thermal runaway](@entry_id:267438).

### Theoretical Frameworks for Runaway Analysis

To formalize the analysis of thermal runaway, classical theories from combustion science provide two powerful, limiting-case frameworks. The choice between these frameworks depends on the relative importance of internal heat conduction versus external heat convection, a balance quantified by the dimensionless **Biot number**, $Bi = hL/k$, where $L$ is a characteristic length of the cell.

#### Semenov and Frank-Kamenetskii Theories

The two foundational theories for [thermal explosion](@entry_id:166460) are the Semenov theory and the Frank-Kamenetskii theory .

*   **Semenov Theory (Lumped Model):** This theory applies when internal thermal resistance is negligible compared to external resistance ($Bi \ll 1$). This corresponds to a thermally thin body where the temperature can be assumed to be spatially uniform. The analysis reduces to the lumped ODE discussed previously: $C dT/dt = \dot{Q}_{gen}(T) - \dot{Q}_{loss}(T)$. The critical condition for runaway is found graphically as the point where the S-shaped heat generation curve becomes tangent to the linear heat loss line. Beyond this point, no stable [steady-state solution](@entry_id:276115) exists, and the temperature will rise uncontrollably.

*   **Frank-Kamenetskii (FK) Theory (Distributed Model):** This theory applies when internal thermal resistance dominates ($Bi \gg 1$), meaning heat conduction within the body is the bottleneck for heat removal. The classical FK model considers the [steady-state heat equation](@entry_id:176086) with an internal source term, $k\nabla^2 T + \dot{q}(T) = 0$, typically with a fixed surface temperature boundary condition ($T_s = T_\infty$). The analysis reveals that [steady-state temperature](@entry_id:136775) profiles only exist if a dimensionless group, the **Frank-Kamenetskii parameter ($\delta$)**, is below a critical value, $\delta_c$. If $\delta > \delta_c$, no steady-state solution is possible, and runaway is inevitable. The value of $\delta_c$ depends on the geometry of the body (e.g., slab, cylinder, sphere). A crucial insight from this theory is the prediction of an internal **hot spot**, where the temperature is highest at the center of the body. Because reaction rates are exponentially sensitive to temperature, this hot spot can drive the system to runaway even when the average temperature is relatively low. For this reason, applying the simpler Semenov theory to a thermally thick body ($Bi \gg 1$) can be non-conservative, as it neglects hot-spot formation and may overpredict the ambient temperature at which runaway will occur .

#### Key Dimensionless Groups in Runaway Modeling

The behavior of a system undergoing thermal runaway can be comprehensively described by a set of dimensionless numbers derived from the governing equations. For a 1D slab model, these key groups are :

*   **Biot Number ($Bi = hL/k$):** As discussed, this ratio of external convective resistance to internal conductive resistance determines the spatial uniformity of the temperature field.
*   **Damköhler Number ($Da$):** This group, defined as the ratio of a characteristic heat diffusion time to a characteristic chemical reaction time (e.g., $Da = t_{diffusion}/t_{reaction}$), compares the rate of [heat transport](@entry_id:199637) to the rate of heat generation. A large $Da$ implies that reaction is fast compared to heat removal, favoring runaway.
*   **Frank-Kamenetskii Parameter ($\delta$):** This is the paramount group for predicting runaway in the FK regime. It is a composite parameter that typically scales with the reaction rate, the square of the system size, the activation energy, and the inverse of the thermal conductivity: $\delta \propto \frac{L^2 \dot{q}(T_\infty) E}{k R T_\infty^2}$.
*   **Dimensionless Heat Release ($\beta$):** This parameter represents the ratio of the total chemical energy available for release to the sensible heat capacity of the system, e.g., $\beta \propto \frac{(-\Delta H)}{c_p \Delta T}$. It quantifies the maximum potential temperature rise due to the reaction.

These groups provide a powerful way to generalize the analysis of thermal runaway, allowing results from one system to be scaled and applied to others with similar dimensionless parameters.

### Modeling Combustion of Vented Gases

The final stage of a severe thermal runaway event often involves the rupture of the cell casing and the forceful ejection of hot, flammable gases. Modeling the subsequent combustion of this vented gas is critical for assessing the full scope of the hazard.

#### Composition of Vented Gases and Combustion Stoichiometry

The vented gases are primarily the decomposition products of the organic carbonate solvents (e.g., [ethylene](@entry_id:155186) carbonate, dimethyl carbonate) and the electrolyte salt (e.g., LiPF$_6$). The flammable components are largely from the C-H-O system and include **carbon monoxide (CO)**, **hydrogen ($\mathrm{H}_2$)**, **methane ($\mathrm{CH}_4$)**, and various light hydrocarbons such as **[ethylene](@entry_id:155186) ($\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_4$)**. The composition of this mixture as it burns depends critically on the availability of an oxidizer, typically oxygen from the surrounding air.

This relationship is quantified by the **equivalence ratio ($\phi$)**, defined as the ratio of the actual fuel-to-oxidizer ratio to the stoichiometric fuel-to-oxidizer ratio. The resulting combustion products are fundamentally different under oxygen-rich and oxygen-lean conditions :

*   **Oxygen-Rich Conditions ($\phi  1$):** When there is an excess of oxygen, the fuel can burn completely. The dominant products of combustion are the most stable oxidized species: **carbon dioxide ($\mathrm{CO}_2$)** and **water ($\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$)**.
*   **Oxygen-Lean Conditions ($\phi > 1$):** When there is insufficient oxygen for complete combustion, the [chemical equilibrium](@entry_id:142113) shifts. Carbon is only partially oxidized, leading to high concentrations of toxic and flammable **carbon monoxide (CO)**. Hydrogen that cannot be converted to water remains as flammable **hydrogen gas ($\mathrm{H}_2$)**. The high-temperature, oxygen-starved environment also favors the persistence of hydrocarbon fragments like **$\mathrm{CH}_4$** and **$\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_4$**.

Therefore, predicting the external fire hazard requires not only modeling the venting process but also considering the mixing of the vented fuel with ambient air to determine the local equivalence ratio and thus the nature and energy release of the subsequent combustion.
