            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and conforming to all criteria for a solvable scientific problem. The concepts of heat of combustion, fuel load, rate of spread, and fireline intensity are fundamental to wildland fire science, and the given values are physically realistic. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for fireline intensity, $I$, from fundamental principles. The fireline intensity is defined as the rate of heat release per unit length of the fireline. Let us consider a segment of the fireline of length $\\Delta L$. The fire front advances at a rate of spread $R$.\n\nIn a time interval $\\Delta t$, the fire front sweeps over a distance $\\Delta x = R \\Delta t$.\nThe area of fuel bed consumed during this time interval is the product of the length of the fireline segment and the distance the front has advanced:\n$$ \\Delta A = \\Delta L \\cdot \\Delta x = \\Delta L \\cdot (R \\Delta t) $$\nThe mass of fuel consumed per unit ground area is given as $W$. Therefore, the total mass of fuel consumed in the area $\\Delta A$ is:\n$$ \\Delta m = W \\cdot \\Delta A = W \\cdot (\\Delta L R \\Delta t) $$\nThe heat of combustion, $H$, is the energy released per unit mass of fuel consumed. The total heat energy, $\\Delta Q$, released from the consumption of mass $\\Delta m$ is:\n$$ \\Delta Q = H \\cdot \\Delta m = H \\cdot (W \\Delta L R \\Delta t) $$\nThe rate of heat release, $\\dot{Q}$, is the heat released per unit time:\n$$ \\dot{Q} = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{H W \\Delta L R \\Delta t}{\\Delta t} = H W R \\Delta L $$\nBy definition, the fireline intensity, $I$, is the rate of heat release per unit length of the fireline. Thus, we divide the total rate of heat release, $\\dot{Q}$, by the length of the fireline segment, $\\Delta L$:\n$$ I = \\frac{\\dot{Q}}{\\Delta L} = \\frac{H W R \\Delta L}{\\Delta L} = HWR $$\nThis provides the derived expression for fireline intensity, also known as Byram's fireline intensity.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $I$ using the given data:\nHeat of combustion, $H = 16\\ \\mathrm{MJ/kg} = 16 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{J/kg}$.\nFuel mass per unit area, $W = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$.\nRate of spread, $R = 0.4\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $I$:\n$$ I = (16 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{J/kg}) \\cdot (0.5\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}) \\cdot (0.4\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) $$\n$$ I = (16 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.4) \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{J/(s \\cdot m)} $$\n$$ I = 3.2 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{W/m} $$\nThe problem requires the result in kilowatts per meter ($\\mathrm{kW/m}$).

The radiative fraction is given as $f_{\\mathrm{rad}} = 0.3$.\nThe radiative component is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rad}} = f_{\\mathrm{rad}} \\cdot I $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rad}} = 0.3 \\cdot (3200\\ \\mathrm{kW/m}) = 960\\ \\mathrm{kW/m} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $I_{\\mathrm{rad}} = 960.0\\ \\mathrm{kW/m}$.\n\nThe convective component is the remaining part of the total intensity:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{conv}} = I - I_{\\mathrm{rad}} = I \\cdot (1 - f_{\\mathrm{rad}}) $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{conv}} = 3200\\ \\mathrm{kW/m} - 960.0\\ \\mathrm{kW/m} = 2240\\ \\mathrm{kW/m} $$\nAlternatively, using the fraction:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{conv}} = (1 - 0.3) \\cdot (3200\\ \\mathrm{kW/m}) = 0.7 \\cdot (3200\\ \\mathrm{kW/m}) = 2240\\ \\mathrm{kW/m} $$\nThis value, $2240$, already has four significant figures if the final zero is treated as significant, which is implied by the calculation.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the temperature tendency, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$, within a conceptual atmospheric grid cell heated from below, and its subsequent numerical evaluation. The derivation will be based on the first law of thermodynamics.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the temperature change is the conservation of energy. For a thermodynamic system, the first law relates the change in internal energy to heat added and work done. However, for processes involving fluid flow and gases at approximately constant pressure, it is more convenient to work with enthalpy, $H$. The problem specifies the specific heat at constant pressure, $c_p$, which strongly indicates that the appropriate physical model is one of isobaric (constant pressure) heating. In this model, we consider a fixed mass of air being heated and assume it can expand or contract to maintain pressure equilibrium with its surroundings. The rate of change of enthalpy for the mass of air in the control volume is equal to the net rate of heat addition, assuming other energy transfer mechanisms are negligible.\n\nThe energy balance equation is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{\\text{net}} $$\nwhere $H$ is the total enthalpy of the air in the volume and $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{net}}$ is the net rate of heat transfer into the volume.\n\nLet us define each term based on the parameters provided.\n\nThe control volume is a rectangular cell of horizontal area $A$ and vertical thickness $\\Delta z$. The volume of the cell is $V = A \\Delta z$.\nThe mass of the dry air, $m$, contained within this volume is given by the product of its constant density $\\rho$ and the volume $V$:\n$$ m = \\rho V = \\rho A \\Delta z $$\n\nThe total enthalpy $H$ of this mass of air is related to its temperature $T$ and specific heat capacity at constant pressure $c_p$ by $H = m c_p T$. The rate of change of enthalpy is then:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(m c_p T) $$\nSince mass $m$ and specific heat capacity $c_p$ are constant, we have:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = m c_p \\frac{dT}{dt} $$\nSubstituting the expression for mass $m$:\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = (\\rho A \\Delta z) c_p \\frac{dT}{dt} $$\nWe use the partial derivative notation $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$ to denote the local time rate of change of temperature at a fixed point within the volume, as is standard in field equations.\n\nThe net rate of heat addition, $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{net}}$, comes solely from the specified surface heat flux, $\\dot{q}_s$, which has units of power per unit area ($\\mathrm{W/m^2}$). This flux is applied over the entire bottom surface of the cell, which has area $A$. Therefore, the total power input to the cell is:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{\\text{net}} = \\dot{q}_s A $$\n\nNow, we equate the rate of enthalpy change with the net rate of heat addition:\n$$ (\\rho A \\Delta z) c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\dot{q}_s A $$\n\nTo find the expression for the temperature tendency, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$, we solve for this term. We can divide both sides by the quantity $(\\rho A \\Delta z) c_p$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\dot{q}_s A}{\\rho c_p A \\Delta z} $$\nThe horizontal area $A$ appears in both the numerator (as it determines the total heat input) and the denominator (as it determines the total mass to be heated) and thus cancels out. This is a critical insight: for a uniform surface flux, the heating rate is independent of the horizontal area of the grid cell. The final derived relation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\dot{q}_s}{\\rho c_p \\Delta z} $$\nThis equation is physically intuitive: the rate of temperature increase is directly proportional to the heat flux $\\dot{q}_s$ and inversely proportional to the air density $\\rho$, the specific heat capacity $c_p$, and the thickness of the atmospheric layer $\\Delta z$ over which the heat is distributed.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis requires computing exponents $n_{\\Delta z}$ and $n_A$ from the best-fit slopes of log-log plots. If a variable $y$ has a power-law dependence on $x$ of the form $y = C x^n$, taking the natural logarithm of both sides yields $\\ln(y) = \\ln(C) + n \\ln(x)$. This is the equation of a straight line in a plot of $\\ln(y)$ versus $\\ln(x)$, where the slope is the exponent $n$.\n\nFor the vertical-resolution sensitivity, we analyze $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$ as a function of $\\Delta z$. Our derived equation can be written as $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\left(\\frac{\\dot{q}_s}{\\rho c_p}\\right) (\\Delta z)^{-1}$. This is a power law with an exponent of exactly $-1$. Therefore, we expect the sensitivity exponent to be $n_{\\Delta z} = -1$.\n\nFor the horizontal-resolution sensitivity, we analyze $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$ as a function of $A$. Our derived equation shows no dependence on $A$. This can be expressed as a power law of the form $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\propto A^0$. Therefore, we expect the sensitivity exponent to be $n_A = 0$.\n\nThe implementation will compute $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t}$ for each test case using the derived formula with the constants $\\dot{q}_s = 200000\\ \\mathrm{W/m^2}$, $\\rho = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, and $c_p = 1005\\ \\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}$. Then, it will perform linear regression on the logarithm of the results against the logarithm of the corresponding geometric parameter to find the exponents $n_{\\Delta z}$ and $n_A$.",

Since $u0$ and $\\Delta t0$, this is always satisfied.\n    b) $x_i - \\Delta x \\le x_i - u \\Delta t \\implies -\\Delta x \\le -u \\Delta t$. Multiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality: $\\Delta x \\ge u \\Delta t$.\n\nThe stability condition is therefore $u \\Delta t \\le \\Delta x$, which can be rewritten in terms of the Courant number, $C = \\frac{u \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$:\n$$\nC \\le 1\n$$\nFor a variable velocity field $u(x,t)$, stability of the explicit scheme must be guaranteed for the worst-case (fastest) speed anywhere in the domain, $u_{\\max}$. Thus, the final stability requirement is:\n$$\n\\frac{u_{\\max} \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1\n$$\nNow, we apply this requirement to the given parameters: $u_{\\max} = 12\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\Delta x = 20\\ \\mathrm{m}$, and a proposed $\\Delta t_{prop} = 1\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\nFirst, we check if the proposed time step is stable by calculating its corresponding Courant number:\n$$\nC_{prop} = \\frac{u_{\\max} \\Delta t_{prop}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{(12\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) (1\\ \\mathrm{s})}{20\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{12}{20} = 0.6\n$$\nSince $C_{prop} = 0.6 \\le 1$, the proposed time step of $\\Delta t = 1\\ \\mathrm{s}$ satisfies the stability requirement.\n\nFinally, we compute the maximum permissible time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, which corresponds to the limit of stability, $C=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{u_{\\max} \\Delta t_{\\max}}{\\Delta x} = 1\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{u_{\\max}} = \\frac{20\\ \\mathrm{m}}{12\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = \\frac{20}{12}\\ \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{5}{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} \\approx 1.6666... \\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} \\approx 1.67\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThis is the maximum time step that can be used while guaranteeing the stability of the numerical scheme.",
