It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical thermodynamics, well-posed with sufficient information to determine a unique solution, and presented in an objective, formal manner. The assumptions, such as ideal-gas behavior and complete combustion, are standard for simplified combustion problems. All necessary thermodynamic data and property models are provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we establish the balanced chemical equation for the stoichiometric combustion of hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H}_2$) with air. Air is modeled as a mixture of oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}_2$) and nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N}_2$) with mole fractions $x_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 0.21$ and $x_{\\mathrm{N}_2} = 0.79$. The molar ratio of nitrogen to oxygen in air is therefore $\\frac{x_{\\mathrm{N}_2}}{x_{\\mathrm{O}_2}} = \\frac{0.79}{0.21}$.\n\nThe general stoichiometric reaction is:\n$$ \\mathrm{H}_2 + a(\\mathrm{O}_2 + \\frac{0.79}{0.21}\\mathrm{N}_2) \\rightarrow b\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} + c\\mathrm{N}_2 $$\nWe balance this equation based on the conservation of atoms for a basis of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H}_2$:\n- Hydrogen (H) atom balance: $2 = 2b \\implies b=1$.\n- Oxygen (O) atom balance: $2a = b \\implies 2a = 1 \\implies a=0.5$.\n- Nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N}_2$) is inert, so the number of moles is conserved: $c = a \\times \\frac{0.79}{0.21} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{0.79}{0.21} = \\frac{0.395}{0.21} = \\frac{79}{42}$.\n\nThe balanced reaction for the consumption of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{H}_2$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{H}_2 + 0.5\\,\\mathrm{O}_2 + \\frac{79}{42}\\,\\mathrm{N}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O} + \\frac{79}{42}\\,\\mathrm{N}_2 $$\nThe reactants are $n_{\\mathrm{H}_2} = 1$ mol, $n_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 0.5$ mol, and $n_{\\mathrm{N}_2,reac} = \\frac{79}{42}$ mol.\nThe products are $n_{\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}} = 1$ mol and $n_{\\mathrm{N}_2,prod} = \\frac{79}{42}$ mol.\n\nNext, we apply the First Law of Thermodynamics for a steady, adiabatic, constant-pressure process. The enthalpy of the reactants at their initial state must equal the enthalpy of the products at the final state (the adiabatic flame temperature, $T_{ad}$).\n$$ H_{reactants} = H_{products} $$\nThe total enthalpy $H$ of a mixture is the sum of the molar enthalpies of its constituents, $H = \\sum_i n_i \\bar{h}_i(T)$. The molar enthalpy of species $i$ at temperature $T$ is the sum of its standard molar enthalpy of formation at a reference temperature $T_0$ and its sensible enthalpy change from $T_0$ to $T$:\n$$ \\bar{h}_i(T) = \\Delta h_{f,i}^{\\circ}(T_0) + \\int_{T_0}^{T} c_{p,i}(T') dT' $$\nIn this problem, the initial temperature is $T_0 = 300$ K, which is also the standard reference temperature.

This implies that the term $-\\frac{D_k^T}{\\rho_k}$ must be positive for hydrogen. As $\\rho_k  0$, the coefficient $D_k^T$ must be negative for hydrogen, which is the standard convention in combustion literature.\n\nThe problem provides a \"mixture-averaged thermal diffusion coefficient\" for hydrogen, $D_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}}$, with units of $\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Let us examine the units of the prefactor in our derived velocity equation: $\\left[-\\frac{D_k^T}{\\rho_k}\\right] = \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}} = \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This matches the units of the given coefficient $D_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}}$. This strongly implies that the problem defines the provided coefficient as:\n$$\nD_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}} \\equiv -\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{H_2}}^T}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}\n$$\nSince $D_{\\mathrm{H_2}}^T$ is negative for hydrogen, this definition makes $D_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}}$ a positive quantity, which is consistent with the given value of $2.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nSubstituting this definition into the expression for the thermal diffusion velocity yields the specific relationship to be used:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}} = D_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}} \\nabla \\ln T\n$$\nUsing the identity provided in the problem, $\\nabla \\ln T = \\frac{1}{T}\\nabla T$, we obtain the final form for the derivation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}} = \\frac{D_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}}}{T} \\nabla T\n$$\nThis equation directly relates the thermal diffusion velocity to the given coefficient and the temperature field.\n\nNext, we evaluate the component of this velocity along the $x$-axis, which we denote as $v_{T,\\mathrm{H_2},x}$. Since the problem is one-dimensional, the gradient $\\nabla T$ becomes $\\frac{dT}{dx}\\mathbf{i}$, where $\\mathbf{i}$ is the unit vector in the $+x$ direction. The scalar component is:\n$$\nv_{T,\\mathrm{H_2},x} = \\frac{D_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}}}{T} \\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting the provided numerical values:\n$$\nv_{T,\\mathrm{H_2},x} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1500 \\,\\mathrm{K}} \\left(1.2 \\times 10^{7} \\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nv_{T,\\mathrm{H_2},x} = \\frac{(2.5 \\times 1.2) \\times (10^{-5} \\times 10^{7})}{1500} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nv_{T,\\mathrm{H_2},x} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{2}}{1500} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nv_{T,\\mathrm{H_2},x} = \\frac{300}{1500} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{5} \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.2 \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the hydrogen thermal diffusion velocity is therefore $|v_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}}| = 0.2 \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The positive sign confirms that hydrogen diffuses in the direction of increasing temperature, as expected.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{\\left|v_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}}\\right|}{S_{L}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $|v_{T,\\mathrm{H_2}}|$ and the given value for $S_{L}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{0.2 \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.82 \\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{20}{82} = \\frac{10}{41}\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx 0.2439024...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, as requested, we get $R = 0.244$. This result shows that in this specific flame condition, the thermal diffusion of hydrogen contributes a velocity that is approximately $24.4\\%$ of the laminar flame speed, highlighting the importance of the Soret effect in modeling hydrogen-containing flames.",
