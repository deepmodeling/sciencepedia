## Introduction
In many advanced engineering systems, from hypersonic vehicles to next-generation combustors, plasmas operate far from the simple, single-temperature state described by classical thermodynamics. This condition of **[thermochemical non-equilibrium](@entry_id:1133047)**, where electrons, ions, and neutral particles possess distinct energy distributions, is not an anomaly but a defining characteristic that governs reactivity and energy transfer. The primary challenge for scientists and engineers is to move beyond the simplifying assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE) to accurately model and predict the behavior of these complex systems. This article provides a comprehensive guide to the principles and applications of [non-equilibrium thermochemistry](@entry_id:1128783). The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms"**, establishes the theoretical groundwork, contrasting the LTE state with [multi-temperature models](@entry_id:1128289) and state-resolved kinetics. The second chapter, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections"**, explores the use of these theories in computational modeling and experimental diagnostics for aerospace and [combustion science](@entry_id:187056). Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section offers practical problems to reinforce key concepts. Our journey begins by defining the foundational state of equilibrium, the essential baseline for understanding any departure from it.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The State of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium

The thermochemical state of a plasma is fundamentally described at the microscopic level by the distribution functions of its constituent particles—electrons, ions, and neutrals. The most foundational [reference state](@entry_id:151465) is that of **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)**. Formally, for a material system, LTE is the state that maximizes the local entropy density, as defined by the Boltzmann H-functional, subject to local constraints on the conserved quantities: elemental mass densities, total [momentum density](@entry_id:271360), and total energy density.

The maximization of entropy under these constraints yields a state of profound simplicity and uniformity. In LTE, all species (electrons and heavy particles) share a single, common temperature, $T$. The velocity distribution functions, $f_s(\mathbf{v})$, for all species $s$ conform to a Maxwellian distribution at this temperature. Concurrently, the populations of internal energy levels (rotational, vibrational, electronic) for every species are governed by a Boltzmann distribution, also at temperature $T$. Finally, the chemical composition of the plasma, i.e., the number densities of all species, satisfies the law of mass action at this same temperature. This includes the Guldberg-Waage law for chemical reactions and the Saha-Boltzmann equation for ionization and recombination equilibria .

From a kinetic perspective, LTE is the state where the collision operator in the Boltzmann equation vanishes. This occurs when **detailed balance** is achieved for every elementary collisional process. For any given reaction, such as $A+B \leftrightarrow C+D$, the forward rate is exactly equal to the reverse rate at every point in space. This microscopic balance ensures that the net production rates of all chemical species are zero, and the system's composition remains stationary, defined by the equilibrium constants at temperature $T$ .

It is crucial to distinguish detailed balance from the principle of **[microscopic reversibility](@entry_id:136535)** (or microreversibility). Microreversibility is a fundamental property of the laws of physics, stemming from [time-reversal invariance](@entry_id:152159) of the governing Hamiltonian. It provides a [reciprocity relation](@entry_id:198404) between the [cross-sections](@entry_id:168295) of a forward process and its time-reversed counterpart, accounting for statistical weights and kinematic factors. This principle holds for any elementary collision, regardless of whether the system is in equilibrium. Detailed balance, in contrast, is a condition of the macroscopic system *at equilibrium*, stating that the population-weighted fluxes between any two states are equal and opposite. The consistency between the statistical description of equilibrium (e.g., Boltzmann factors) and the kinetic description (detailed balance) is guaranteed by microreversibility .

A final important distinction is between LTE and true Thermodynamic Equilibrium (TE). In TE, the radiation field must also be in equilibrium with the matter, meaning it must be described by a Planck function at the same temperature $T$. However, many laboratory and astrophysical plasmas are "optically thin," meaning radiation can freely escape, and the local [radiation field](@entry_id:164265) is far from Planckian. LTE is a more practical and widely applicable concept that describes a state of equilibrium for the material particles among themselves, even if they are not in equilibrium with the [radiation field](@entry_id:164265) .

### Departures from Equilibrium: Multi-Temperature and Partial Equilibrium States

The stringent conditions required for LTE are often not met in practice. LTE is a valid approximation only when collisional processes, which drive the system towards equilibrium, are significantly faster than any processes that might drive it away. These competing processes include macroscopic transport due to flow gradients (with a [characteristic time scale](@entry_id:274321) $L/U$, where $L$ is a length scale and $U$ is a characteristic velocity) and radiative processes, such as [spontaneous emission](@entry_id:140032) (with a rate $A_{ij}$). A useful sufficient criterion for the validity of LTE is that collisional rates $C_{ij}$ must dominate: $C_{ij} \gg U/L$ and $C_{ij} \gg A_{ij}$ .

When these conditions are not met, the plasma exists in a state of **non-equilibrium**. Such states are often characterized by a disparity in the characteristic timescales of different energy exchange processes. For example, translation-translation (T-T) and translation-rotation (T-R) energy exchanges among heavy particles are typically very rapid, while translation-vibration (T-V) and translation-electron (T-e) exchanges can be much slower. If there is a clear [separation of timescales](@entry_id:191220), the system may relax to a state of **[partial equilibrium](@entry_id:1129368)**. In such a state, a subset of fast-exchanging energy modes equilibrates internally, while remaining out of equilibrium with the slower modes. A common example is a state where the translational and [rotational modes](@entry_id:151472) of all heavy species equilibrate at a common heavy-particle temperature, $T_h$, while vibrational and electronic modes, as well as the electrons, have distinct energy distributions. In this state of partial T-R equilibrium, chemical reaction rates and energy exchange between the equilibrated subset and other modes are not zero .

A more general and powerful framework for describing non-equilibrium plasmas is the **[multi-temperature model](@entry_id:1128288)**. This approach assigns a distinct temperature to each internal energy mode that is not in equilibrium with the others. A comprehensive model might include:
*   An electron translational temperature, $T_e$.
*   A heavy-particle translational temperature, $T_{tr,h}$.
*   A molecular rotational temperature, $T_r$.
*   A molecular vibrational temperature, $T_v$.
*   A heavy-species [electronic excitation](@entry_id:183394) temperature, $T_{el}$.

In the framework of [irreversible thermodynamics](@entry_id:142664), each temperature $T_\alpha$ is associated with a [specific energy](@entry_id:271007) reservoir (e.g., $T_v$ with the total vibrational energy of the molecules). The departure from full equilibrium gives rise to irreversible [entropy production](@entry_id:141771). This [entropy production](@entry_id:141771) has two principal components: transport and inter-mode exchange. Transport-driven [entropy production](@entry_id:141771) arises from the coupling of fluxes to [thermodynamic forces](@entry_id:161907), such as the heat flux of a mode, $\mathbf{q}_\alpha$, coupling to the gradient of its inverse temperature, $\nabla(1/T_\alpha)$. Inter-mode exchange-driven [entropy production](@entry_id:141771) arises from the net energy transfer between modes, taking the form of products of an exchange power $\Xi_{\alpha\beta}$ and the difference in inverse temperatures, $(1/T_\alpha - 1/T_\beta)$ .

### Kinetic Distributions in Non-Equilibrium Plasmas

The [multi-temperature model](@entry_id:1128288) provides a fluid-level description of non-equilibrium. The underlying physics, however, resides in the particle-level kinetic distribution functions.

#### The Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF)

Perhaps the most critical kinetic descriptor in a [non-equilibrium plasma](@entry_id:752559) is the **Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF)**, often denoted $f(\varepsilon)$. It is defined as a probability density such that for a total electron [number density](@entry_id:268986) $n_e$, the density of electrons with kinetic energy in the range $[\varepsilon, \varepsilon+d\varepsilon]$ is $n_e f(\varepsilon) d\varepsilon$. The EEDF is normalized such that $\int_0^\infty f(\varepsilon) d\varepsilon = 1$. The shape of the EEDF is determined by the balance between energy gained by electrons (typically from an electric field) and energy lost through collisions. Three [canonical forms](@entry_id:153058) are particularly important :

1.  **Maxwellian EEDF**: This distribution, whose energy probability function is proportional to $\exp(-\varepsilon / (k_B T_e))$, arises when electron-electron (e-e) collisions are the dominant energy exchange process for electrons. The high efficiency of Coulomb collisions in redistributing energy among the electron population drives the EEDF towards this most probable, thermalized state, characterized by a single electron temperature $T_e$. This often occurs in plasmas with a sufficiently high [degree of ionization](@entry_id:264739).

2.  **Druyvesteyn EEDF**: This distribution, with an energy probability function proportional to $\exp(-C \varepsilon^2)$ for some constant $C$, is characteristic of weakly ionized plasmas where e-e collisions are negligible. It arises when electrons gain energy from a DC electric field and lose it primarily through *elastic* collisions with heavy neutral particles, under the specific condition that the momentum-transfer [collision cross-section](@entry_id:141552) is approximately constant with energy. Compared to a Maxwellian with the same average energy, the Druyvesteyn distribution is depleted in the high-energy tail, meaning there are fewer high-energy electrons.

3.  **Bi-Maxwellian EEDF**: This is a superposition of two Maxwellian distributions at different temperatures, $T_1$ and $T_2$. It is a phenomenological model used to describe plasmas with two distinct, weakly interacting electron populations. Such a situation can occur, for instance, when a population of high-energy "primary" electrons, accelerated in a sheath or created by specific reactions, coexists with a colder bulk electron population.

#### Non-Equilibrium Vibrational Distributions: The Treanor Distribution

Similar to electrons, the internal energy modes of molecules can exhibit strongly non-equilibrium distributions. A classic example is the vibrational population distribution of [diatomic molecules](@entry_id:148655) in a plasma where $T_v > T_g$ (vibrational temperature exceeds gas temperature). If the vibrational levels are anharmonic and the dominant collisional process is the near-resonant exchange of single vibrational quanta between molecules (V-V exchange), a **Treanor distribution** emerges. This state occurs when the rate of V-V exchange is much faster than both the rate of [vibrational energy](@entry_id:157909) pumping (e.g., by [electron impact](@entry_id:183205)) and the rate of vibrational-translational (V-T) relaxation.

The Treanor distribution is characterized by a significant overpopulation of the higher vibrational levels compared to a Boltzmann distribution at the same effective vibrational temperature. It is given by the relation $n_v \propto \exp(-v \varepsilon_{01}/(k_B T_v) + (\varepsilon_v - v\varepsilon_{01})/(k_B T_g))$, where $\varepsilon_v$ is the energy of the $v$-th level, $\varepsilon_{01}$ is the energy of the first vibrational quantum, $T_v$ is the effective vibrational temperature of the lowest levels, and $T_g$ is the translational gas temperature. This overpopulation is a direct consequence of [anharmonicity](@entry_id:137191): as vibrational quanta are "climbed" up the ladder via V-V exchanges, the decreasing energy gap between levels means the excess energy, which must be absorbed by the [translational motion](@entry_id:187700) at $T_g$, becomes smaller, favoring the population of higher levels .

### Thermodynamic and Kinetic Formalism

#### The Generalized Partition Function

In equilibrium statistical mechanics, the [canonical partition function](@entry_id:154330) $Z(T)$ is central, serving as the [normalization constant](@entry_id:190182) for the Boltzmann probability distribution and providing access to all [thermodynamic state functions](@entry_id:191389), such as the Helmholtz free energy via $F = -k_B T \ln Z$. In a multi-temperature non-equilibrium system, a single such potential does not exist. However, a **generalized species partition function** can be constructed.

Assuming the energy modes are separable ($E = \epsilon_t + \epsilon_r + \epsilon_v + \epsilon_e$), this non-equilibrium partition function is defined as the product of the individual modal partition functions, with each evaluated at its own characteristic temperature:
$Z_{\mathrm{neq}} = Z_t(T_t) Z_r(T_r) Z_v(T_v) Z_e(T_e)$.
For example, the [translational partition function](@entry_id:136950) would be $Z_t(T_t) = V(2\pi m k_B T_t / h^2)^{3/2}$, while the [vibrational partition function](@entry_id:138551) would be $Z_v(T_v) = \sum_v \exp(-\epsilon_v / (k_B T_v))$. This construct is invaluable for calculating modal populations and total internal energy. However, it must be used with a clear understanding of its limitations: $Z_{\mathrm{neq}}$ does not correspond to the normalization of a single probability distribution over total energy and is not linked to a single thermodynamic free energy potential in the way its equilibrium counterpart is .

#### From Microscopic Cross-Sections to Macroscopic Rates

The macroscopic rate of any collisional process is determined by averaging the microscopic interaction probability over the energy distributions of the colliding particles. The fundamental quantity describing the microscopic probability of a reaction is the **[collision cross-section](@entry_id:141552)**, $\sigma(\varepsilon)$, which depends on the center-of-mass [collision energy](@entry_id:183483), $\varepsilon$.

The macroscopic **rate coefficient**, $k$, for a binary collision process (e.g., between an electron and a neutral molecule) is obtained by integrating the product of the cross-section and the relative speed, $v(\varepsilon) = \sqrt{2\varepsilon/\mu}$ (where $\mu$ is the [reduced mass](@entry_id:152420)), over the normalized energy distribution function of the colliding particles. For electron-impact reactions, this is the EEDF, $f(\varepsilon)$:
$$ k = \int_{0}^{\infty} \sigma(\varepsilon) v(\varepsilon) f(\varepsilon) d\varepsilon $$
This integral relationship highlights the critical role of the EEDF: two plasmas with the same average electron energy but different EEDF shapes (e.g., Maxwellian vs. Druyvesteyn) will exhibit vastly different reaction rates for processes with strong energy-dependent cross-sections .

### Key Electron-Impact Mechanisms

In plasmas for combustion applications, a few classes of electron-impact reactions are of paramount importance. Their [cross-sections](@entry_id:168295) determine the rates of ionization, [radical production](@entry_id:1130516), and negative ion formation .

*   **Electron-Impact Ionization**: $e^- + \mathrm{M} \to 2e^- + \mathrm{M}^+$. This is the primary process for sustaining a plasma. The reaction has a sharp energy threshold equal to the [ionization potential](@entry_id:198846) of the target species M (e.g., $\sim 12.1$ eV for $\mathrm{O_2}$, $\sim 15.6$ eV for $\mathrm{N_2}$). The cross-section rises from zero at the threshold to a broad maximum, typically at an energy several times the threshold (e.g., 50-100 eV), and then slowly decreases at higher energies.

*   **Electron-Impact Dissociation**: $e^- + \mathrm{AB} \to e^- + \mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B}$. This process is a major source of chemically reactive radicals. It proceeds via [electronic excitation](@entry_id:183394) of the molecule to a repulsive or predissociative state. The absolute energy threshold is the [bond dissociation energy](@entry_id:136571) ($D_0$, e.g., $\sim 5.1$ eV for $\mathrm{O_2}$). However, due to the Franck-Condon principle, the effective threshold is often significantly higher (e.g., $\sim 8$ eV for $\mathrm{O_2}$), corresponding to the vertical transition to the repulsive state. The cross-section typically exhibits a broad maximum in the 10-30 eV range.

*   **Dissociative Attachment**: $e^- + \mathrm{AB} \to \mathrm{A}^- + \mathrm{B}$. This is a key mechanism for forming negative ions. It is a resonant process where the electron is temporarily captured to form a transient negative ion, which then dissociates. The thermodynamic threshold is given by $E_{th} = D_0(\mathrm{AB}) - \mathrm{EA}(\mathrm{A})$, where $\mathrm{EA}(\mathrm{A})$ is the electron affinity of the fragment A. Because it is resonant, the cross-section is not a [smooth function](@entry_id:158037) but instead shows distinct, often narrow, peaks at specific energies corresponding to the transient negative ion states (e.g., for $\mathrm{O_2}$, a prominent peak occurs near 6.5 eV).

### Governing Equations and Plasma Structure

#### Multi-Temperature Energy Conservation

To computationally model a [non-equilibrium plasma](@entry_id:752559), one must solve a system of [conservation equations](@entry_id:1122898). The energy conservation equation must be split into separate equations for the modes that are not in equilibrium. For a common two-temperature ($T_e$, $T_h$) model, the energy equations for the electron and heavy-species translational modes take the following form :

For electrons:
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{3}{2} n_e k_B T_e\right) + \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{5}{2} k_B T_e \boldsymbol{\Gamma}_e + \mathbf{q}_e\right) = \mathbf{J}_e \cdot \mathbf{E} - Q_{e \to h}^{\mathrm{el}} - \sum_r \varepsilon_r R_r
$$
For heavy-species ([translational energy](@entry_id:170705)):
$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{3}{2} n_h k_B T_h\right) + \nabla \cdot \left(\frac{5}{2} k_B T_h \boldsymbol{\Gamma}_h + \mathbf{q}_h\right) = \Phi + \sum_i \mathbf{J}_i \cdot \mathbf{E} + Q_{e \to h}^{\mathrm{el}}
$$
Here, $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}_s$ and $\mathbf{q}_s$ are the particle and heat fluxes, and $\mathbf{J}_s$ is the electric current density for species $s$. The source/sink terms are:
*   **Joule Heating**: The work done by the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ is partitioned. Electrons gain energy at a rate of $\mathbf{J}_e \cdot \mathbf{E}$, and ions gain energy at a rate of $\sum_i \mathbf{J}_i \cdot \mathbf{E}$.
*   **Elastic Exchange**: Energy is exchanged in elastic collisions between electrons and heavy particles. The term $Q_{e \to h}^{\mathrm{el}}$ represents the net rate of energy transfer from electrons to heavies, acting as a sink for electrons and a source for heavies.
*   **Inelastic Losses**: Energy lost by electrons in [inelastic collisions](@entry_id:137360) (e.g., ionization, [dissociation](@entry_id:144265)) is represented by $\sum_r \varepsilon_r R_r$. This energy is transferred to the internal or chemical potential of the heavy species and thus appears only as a sink in the electron energy equation.
*   **Viscous Dissipation**: The irreversible conversion of macroscopic kinetic energy into thermal motion of the heavy species is represented by $\Phi$, which acts as a source term in the heavy-species [energy equation](@entry_id:156281).

#### Electrostatic Effects: Quasi-neutrality and Sheaths

On macroscopic scales, plasmas are often treated as electrically neutral, an approximation known as **quasi-neutrality**, where the electron number density is nearly equal to the total ion number density ($n_e \approx \sum_i Z_i n_i$). This approximation is valid for systems whose characteristic length scale $L$ is much larger than the **Debye length**, $\lambda_D$ ($L \gg \lambda_D$).

The Debye length is the fundamental scale over which a plasma shields out electrostatic perturbations. An imbalance of charge creates an electric field, which causes mobile charges—primarily the light and energetic electrons—to rearrange themselves to screen the field. For a [non-equilibrium plasma](@entry_id:752559), this screening is governed by the electron temperature and density, with the Debye length given by:
$$ \lambda_D = \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_e e^2}} $$
For typical [plasma-assisted combustion](@entry_id:1129759) conditions ($n_e = 10^{19} \text{ m}^{-3}$, $T_e = 2 \text{ eV}$), the Debye length is on the micrometer scale ($\lambda_D \approx 3.3 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}$), justifying the quasi-neutral approximation in the bulk plasma region .

However, quasi-neutrality inevitably fails near material boundaries. Due to their much higher thermal velocity ($v_{th,e} \propto \sqrt{T_e/m_e}$), electrons initially flow to a bounding wall far more rapidly than ions. This efflux of negative charge leaves behind a region depleted of electrons, creating a net positive space charge ($n_i > n_e$). This non-neutral region is the **[plasma sheath](@entry_id:201017)**. Within the sheath, which has a thickness of several Debye lengths, a strong electric field develops. This field repels further electrons from the wall and accelerates positive ions towards it, eventually establishing a steady state where the fluxes of positive and negative charge to the surface are balanced. The sheath is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of [plasma-wall interactions](@entry_id:187149), and the large potential drop across it plays a critical role in surface processes and [plasma confinement](@entry_id:203546) .
