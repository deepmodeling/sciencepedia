The particle is exposed isothermally to methane at a constant bulk concentration $C_{CH_4}$, and external gas-phase mass transfer, intraparticle diffusion, and product-layer resistance are negligible so that the gas-solid reaction is reaction-controlled. The interfacial rate of methane consumption per unit area is first order in methane, given by $r = k\\,C_{CH_4}$, where $k$ is the surface reaction rate constant. The surface reaction consumes $\\nu$ moles of reactive lattice oxygen in the solid per mole of methane according to the overall stoichiometry of the reduction step. The unreacted core model applies: the reaction occurs at a sharp interface, the unreacted core radius $r_{c}(t)$ decreases from $R$ to $0$, and the solid properties ($C_{s}$ and geometric sphericity) remain constant throughout conversion.\n\nStarting from conservation of moles of reactive lattice oxygen in the unreacted core and the definition of interfacial molar flux, derive a closed-form analytical expression for the time $t_{c}$ required for complete conversion of the particle, expressed in terms of $R$, $C_{s}$, $\\nu$, $k$, and $C_{CH_4}$. Provide the final expression for $t_{c}$ only. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the time for complete conversion, $t_c$, of a spherical oxygen-carrier particle under the reaction-controlled regime of the unreacted core model. We begin by establishing a molar balance on the reactive lattice oxygen within the unreacted core of the particle.\n\nLet $r_c(t)$ be the radius of the unreacted core at time $t$. The volume of this spherical core is $V_c(t) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_c(t)^3$.\nThe problem states that the molar concentration of reactive lattice oxygen in the solid is a constant, $C_s$, with units of moles per unit volume of solid. Therefore, the total number of moles of reactive oxygen, $N_O(t)$, remaining in the unreacted core at time $t$ is:\n$$N_O(t) = C_s V_c(t) = C_s \\left( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_c(t)^3 \\right)$$\n\nThe rate of consumption of this oxygen is the negative time derivative of $N_O(t)$:\n$$\\text{Rate of O consumption} = -\\frac{dN_O}{dt} = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( C_s \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_c^3 \\right)$$\nSince $C_s$ is a constant, we apply the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$-\\frac{dN_O}{dt} = -C_s \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{d}{dt}(r_c^3) = -C_s \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left( 3 r_c^2 \\frac{dr_c}{dt} \\right)$$\n$$-\\frac{dN_O}{dt} = -4\\pi C_s r_c^2 \\frac{dr_c}{dt}$$\nNote that $\\frac{dr_c}{dt}$ is negative, so the consumption rate is positive, as expected.\n\nThis rate of consumption must be equal to the rate at which oxygen is consumed by the chemical reaction occurring at the surface of the unreacted core. The problem states that the reaction is reaction-controlled and occurs at this sharp interface.\n\nThe surface area of the unreacted core is $A_c(t) = 4\\pi r_c(t)^2$.\nThe interfacial rate of methane consumption per unit area is given as a first-order reaction: $r = k\\,C_{CH_4}$, where $C_{CH_4}$ is the constant bulk concentration of methane.\nThe total molar rate of methane consumption over the entire surface of the core is the rate per unit area multiplied by the total area:\n$$\\text{Total rate of } CH_4 \\text{ consumption} = r \\cdot A_c = (k\\,C_{CH_4}) (4\\pi r_c^2)$$\n\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction is given as $\\nu$ moles of reactive lattice oxygen consumed per mole of methane. Therefore, the total rate of oxygen consumption at the reaction interface is $\\nu$ times the total rate of methane consumption:\n$$\\text{Rate of O consumption at interface} = \\nu \\cdot (k\\,C_{CH_4}) (4\\pi r_c^2)$$\n\nBy the principle of conservation of mass, the rate of depletion of oxygen from the core must equal the rate of consumption at the reaction interface. We equate the two derived expressions for the oxygen consumption rate:\n$$-4\\pi C_s r_c^2 \\frac{dr_c}{dt} = \\nu k\\,C_{CH_4} (4\\pi r_c^2)$$\n\nFor $r_c > 0$, we can divide both sides by $4\\pi r_c^2$:\n$$-C_s \\frac{dr_c}{dt} = \\nu k C_{CH_4}$$\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables:\n$$dr_c = -\\frac{\\nu k C_{CH_4}}{C_s} dt$$\n\nTo find the time required for complete conversion, $t_c$, we integrate this equation.

The Thiele modulus, $\\phi$, compares the rate of reaction to the rate of diffusion.\n-   If $\\phi \\ll 1$, the overall process is limited by the chemical reaction rate (kinetically limited regimen).\n-   If $\\phi \\gg 1$, the overall process is limited by the rate of internal diffusion (diffusion-limited regimen).\n-   If $\\phi \\approx 1$, both reaction and diffusion rates are comparable and influence the overall process rate (intermediate regimen).\n\nA value of $\\phi = 1.56$ falls into the intermediate regimen. It is not small enough to neglect diffusion effects nor large enough for the reaction to be considered instantaneous compared to diffusion. Therefore, internal diffusion significantly reduces the reactant concentration within the particle, and as a result, limits the overall reaction rate. The effectiveness factor, which is the ratio of the actual overall rate to the rate that would be observed if the entire interior of the particle were exposed to the surface concentration, would be noticeably less than $1$. Thus, under these conditions, internal diffusion is expected to be a limiting factor for the overall rate.",

The problem statement explicitly controls for this thermal effect by assuming $T_{ad}$ is held constant, but the physical reasoning in this option is flawed.\n- The conclusion that flame speed increases is contrary to our kinetic analysis.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. For a fixed $[O_2]$, three-body termination rates $H+O_2+M$ are independent of the diluent identity, so replacing $N_2$ by $CO_2$ leaves the radical pool and laminar flame speed unchanged.**\n- The termination rate depends on $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}] = \\sum_i \\varepsilon_i [i]$. Since the third-body efficiency for $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ ($\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 3.0$) is different from that of $\\mathrm{N_2}$ ($\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 1.0$), the termination rate is explicitly dependent on the diluent identity.\n- The premise is false, and as shown in the derivation, both the radical pool dynamics ($\\omega_{net}$) and the flame speed ($S_L$) are significantly altered.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In chemical looping combustion, $CO_2$ present in the fuel reactor acts only as an inert diluent with zero third-body efficiency in $H+O_2+M$ recombination, so it does not suppress chain branching or reduce flame speed.**\n- The premise that $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ has zero third-body efficiency is factually incorrect. The problem provides $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 3.0$, which reflects the well-known experimental fact that $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is an effective third body in many recombination reactions.\n- Because its efficiency is significantly greater than zero (and greater than that of $\\mathrm{N_2}$), $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ strongly enhances the termination rate, which suppresses the net radical production and reduces the flame speed. The conclusion is therefore also false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**",
