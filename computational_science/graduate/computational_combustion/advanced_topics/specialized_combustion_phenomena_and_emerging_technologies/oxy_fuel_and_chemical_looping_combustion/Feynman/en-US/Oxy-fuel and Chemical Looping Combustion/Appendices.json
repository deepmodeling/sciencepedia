It provides a complete set of conditions and constraints ($x, y, R$, steady-state, complete stoichiometric combustion) to determine a unique set of outputs (outlet mole fractions). The constraint $R < 1$ ensures a non-zero exhaust flow, which is necessary for a physically meaningful steady state with continuous feed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and formal scientific language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid** and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe first step is to establish the stoichiometric equation for the complete combustion of the hydrocarbon fuel $C_{x}H_{y}$ with pure oxygen $O_{2}$. The products are specified as carbon dioxide $CO_{2}$ and water $H_{2}O$.\n\nThe balanced chemical reaction is:\n$$\nC_{x}H_{y} + \\left(x + \\frac{y}{4}\\right) O_{2} \\rightarrow x CO_{2} + \\frac{y}{2} H_{2}O\n$$\n\nWe will perform a mole balance analysis. Let us establish a basis of calculation: a continuous molar flow rate of fuel, $\\dot{n}_{C_{x}H_{y}, fresh}$, equal to $1$ mole per unit time entering the overall process.\n\nAccording to the problem statement and the stoichiometry, the fresh feed to the system consists of:\n- Fuel feed: $\\dot{n}_{C_{x}H_{y}, fresh} = 1$\n- Stoichiometric oxygen feed: $\\dot{n}_{O_{2}, fresh} = x + \\frac{y}{4}$\n\nThe system is at steady state. Consider a control volume enclosing the entire process (mixer, combustor, and splitter). At steady state, the molar flow of each element entering the control volume must equal the molar flow of that element exiting. Since combustion is complete and the feed is stoichiometric, the only species exiting in the final exhaust stream are $CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$.\n\n- **Carbon Balance**: The rate of carbon atoms in is $1 \\cdot x$. The rate of carbon atoms out is $\\dot{n}_{CO_{2}, exhaust} \\cdot 1$.\n$$\nx = \\dot{n}_{CO_{2}, exhaust}\n$$\n- **Hydrogen Balance**: The rate of hydrogen atoms in is $1 \\cdot y$. The rate of hydrogen atoms out is $\\dot{n}_{H_{2}O, exhaust} \\cdot 2$.\n$$\ny = 2 \\cdot \\dot{n}_{H_{2}O, exhaust} \\implies \\dot{n}_{H_{2}O, exhaust} = \\frac{y}{2}\n$$\n\nThe total molar flow rate of the final exhaust stream, $\\dot{N}_{exhaust}$, is the sum of the molar flow rates of its components:\n$$\n\\dot{N}_{exhaust} = \\dot{n}_{CO_{2}, exhaust} + \\dot{n}_{H_{2}O, exhaust} = x + \\frac{y}{2}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the recycle loop returns a fraction $R$ of the total combustor outlet molar flow, $\\dot{N}_{out}$, back to the inlet. The remaining fraction, $(1-R)$, constitutes the final exhaust stream.\n$$\n\\dot{N}_{exhaust} = (1-R) \\dot{N}_{out}\n$$\nThe splitter does not alter the composition of the stream. Therefore, the mole fractions of all species in the combustor outlet stream are identical to their mole fractions in the final exhaust stream. Let $Y_{CO_{2}, out}$ and $Y_{H_{2}O, out}$ be the mole fractions of $CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$ at the combustor outlet.\n\n$$\nY_{CO_{2}, out} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{CO_{2}, exhaust}}{\\dot{N}_{exhaust}} = \\frac{x}{x + \\frac{y}{2}}\n$$\n$$\nY_{H_{2}O, out} = \\frac{\\dot{n}_{H_{2}O, exhaust}}{\\dot{N}_{exhaust}} = \\frac{\\frac{y}{2}}{x + \\frac{y}{2}}\n$$\n\nTo confirm this result and explicitly demonstrate the role of $R$, we can perform a mole balance directly around the combustor. Let $\\dot{n}_{i, in}$ and $\\dot{n}_{i, out}$ be the molar flow rates of species $i$ into and out of the combustor, respectively. Let $\\xi$ be the extent of reaction. The general balance is $\\dot{n}_{i, out} = \\dot{n}_{i, in} + \\nu_i \\xi$, where $\\nu_i$ is the stoichiometric coefficient.\n\nThe feed to the combustor is the sum of fresh feeds and the recycle stream. The recycle stream contains products $CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$ at molar flow rates $\\dot{n}_{CO_{2}, recycle} = R \\cdot \\dot{n}_{CO_{2}, out}$ and $\\dot{n}_{H_{2}O, recycle} = R \\cdot \\dot{n}_{H_{2}O, out}$. Since $\\dot{n}_{i, out} = Y_{i, out} \\dot{N}_{out}$, the recycle flows are $R \\cdot Y_{CO_{2}, out} \\dot{N}_{out}$ and $R \\cdot Y_{H_{2}O, out} \\dot{N}_{out}$.\n\n- **Fuel Balance (C$_{x}$H$_{y}$)**: $\\dot{n}_{C_{x}H_{y}, in} = 1$. $\\dot{n}_{C_{x}H_{y}, out} = 0$ (complete combustion).\n$$\n0 = 1 + (-1)\\xi \\implies \\xi = 1\n$$\n- **CO$_{2}$ Balance**: $\\dot{n}_{CO_{2}, in} = R \\cdot Y_{CO_{2}, out} \\dot{N}_{out}$. $\\dot{n}_{CO_{2}, out} = Y_{CO_{2}, out} \\dot{N}_{out}$.\n$$\nY_{CO_{2}, out} \\dot{N}_{out} = (R \\cdot Y_{CO_{2}, out} \\dot{N}_{out}) + (x) \\xi\n$$\nWith $\\xi = 1$:\n$$\nY_{CO_{2}, out} \\dot{N}_{out} (1-R) = x\n$$\n- **H$_{2}$O Balance**: $\\dot{n}_{H_{2}O, in} = R \\cdot Y_{H_{2}O, out} \\dot{N}_{out}$. $\\dot{n}_{H_{2}O, out} = Y_{H_{2}O, out} \\dot{N}_{out}$.\n$$\nY_{H_{2}O, out} \\dot{N}_{out} = (R \\cdot Y_{H_{2}O, out} \\dot{N}_{out}) + \\left(\\frac{y}{2}\\right) \\xi\n$$\nWith $\\xi = 1$:\n$$\nY_{H_{2}O, out} \\dot{N}_{out} (1-R) = \\frac{y}{2}\n$$\nFrom the $CO_{2}$ and $H_{2}O$ balances, we can equate the term $\\dot{N}_{out}(1-R)$:\n$$\n\\frac{x}{Y_{CO_{2}, out}} = \\frac{y/2}{Y_{H_{2}O, out}} \\implies x \\cdot Y_{H_{2}O, out} = \\frac{y}{2} \\cdot Y_{CO_{2}, out}\n$$\nSince $CO_2$ and $H_2O$ are the only products, the sum of their mole fractions is $1$:\n$$\nY_{CO_{2}, out} + Y_{H_{2}O, out} = 1 \\implies Y_{H_{2}O, out} = 1 - Y_{CO_{2}, out}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the previous relation:\n$$\nx(1 - Y_{CO_{2}, out}) = \\frac{y}{2} Y_{CO_{2}, out}\n$$\n$$\nx = x \\cdot Y_{CO_{2}, out} + \\frac{y}{2} Y_{CO_{2}, out} = Y_{CO_{2}, out} \\left(x + \\frac{y}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nY_{CO_{2}, out} = \\frac{x}{x + \\frac{y}{2}}\n$$\nAnd for water:\n$$\nY_{H_{2}O, out} = 1 - Y_{CO_{2}, out} = 1 - \\frac{x}{x + \\frac{y}{2}} = \\frac{x + \\frac{y}{2} - x}{x + \\frac{y}{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{y}{2}}{x + \\frac{y}{2}}\n$$\nThese results confirm the initial analysis. The recycle fraction $R$ influences the total molar flow rate within the system (e.g., $\\dot{N}_{out} = (x + y/2)/(1-R)$), and consequently affects process variables like temperature and residence time. However, under the strict idealizations of complete, stoichiometric combustion with no side reactions or dissociation, the composition of the outlet stream is determined solely by the elemental composition of the fuel ($x, y$) and is independent of $R$.\n\nFor a cleaner final expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $2$:\n$$\nY_{CO_{2}, out} = \\frac{2x}{2x + y}\n$$\n$$\nY_{H_{2}O, out} = \\frac{y}{2x + y}\n$$\nThe results are presented as a row matrix as requested.",

Provide the final expression for $t_{c}$ only. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the time for complete conversion, $t_c$, of a spherical oxygen-carrier particle under the reaction-controlled regime of the unreacted core model. We begin by establishing a molar balance on the reactive lattice oxygen within the unreacted core of the particle.\n\nLet $r_c(t)$ be the radius of the unreacted core at time $t$. The volume of this spherical core is $V_c(t) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_c(t)^3$.\nThe problem states that the molar concentration of reactive lattice oxygen in the solid is a constant, $C_s$, with units of moles per unit volume of solid. Therefore, the total number of moles of reactive oxygen, $N_O(t)$, remaining in the unreacted core at time $t$ is:\n$$N_O(t) = C_s V_c(t) = C_s \\left( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_c(t)^3 \\right)$$\n\nThe rate of consumption of this oxygen is the negative time derivative of $N_O(t)$:\n$$\\text{Rate of O consumption} = -\\frac{dN_O}{dt} = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( C_s \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_c^3 \\right)$$\nSince $C_s$ is a constant, we apply the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$-\\frac{dN_O}{dt} = -C_s \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{d}{dt}(r_c^3) = -C_s \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left( 3 r_c^2 \\frac{dr_c}{dt} \\right)$$\n$$-\\frac{dN_O}{dt} = -4\\pi C_s r_c^2 \\frac{dr_c}{dt}$$\nNote that $\\frac{dr_c}{dt}$ is negative, so the consumption rate is positive, as expected.\n\nThis rate of consumption must be equal to the rate at which oxygen is consumed by the chemical reaction occurring at the surface of the unreacted core.

Laminar Flame Speed Scaling**\nAccording to classical flame theory (e.g., ZFK theory), for a reaction-diffusion front with a characteristic reaction rate $\\omega$, the laminar flame speed $S_L$ scales as $S_L \\propto \\sqrt{\\alpha \\omega}$, where $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity. The problem states to use a linearized source term, so the relevant characteristic rate is $\\omega_{net}$. The problem also specifies to neglect differences in $\\alpha$. Therefore, the scaling relation is:\n$$\nS_L \\propto \\sqrt{\\omega_{net}} = \\sqrt{k_b [O_2] - k_t [O_2] [M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]}\n$$\n\n**3. Analysis of Case AIR**\nThe oxidizer is composed of $X_{O_2} = 0.21$ and $X_{N_2} = 0.79$. Let the total molar concentration of the oxidizer be $C_{ox}$. The molar concentrations of the components are $[O_2] = 0.21 C_{ox}$ and $[N_2] = 0.79 C_{ox}$.\nThe effective third-body concentration $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]$ is:\n$$\n[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]_{\\mathrm{AIR}} = \\varepsilon_{O_2} [O_2] + \\varepsilon_{N_2} [N_2] = (1.0)(0.21 C_{ox}) + (1.0)(0.79 C_{ox}) = C_{ox}\n$$\nThe problem states that the termination rate coefficient constant is $100\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ per unit $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]$. Let's normalize $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]$ by $C_{ox}$, defining $\\tilde{M}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = [M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]/C_{ox}$. For the AIR case, $\\tilde{M}_{\\mathrm{eff, AIR}} = 1.0$. The net radical growth rate is then:\n$$\n\\omega_{net, \\mathrm{AIR}} = k_b [O_2] - (100\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\tilde{M}_{\\mathrm{eff, AIR}}\n$$\nUsing the given value $k_b [O_2] = 300\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{net, \\mathrm{AIR}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} - (100\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(1.0) = 200\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\n\n**4. Analysis of Case OXY**\nThe oxidizer is composed of $X_{O_2} = 0.21$ and $X_{CO_2} = 0.79$. The total oxidizer concentration $C_{ox}$ is the same. The molar concentrations are $[O_2] = 0.21 C_{ox}$ and $[CO_2] = 0.79 C_{ox}$.\nThe effective third-body concentration $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]$ is:\n$$\n[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]_{\\mathrm{OXY}} = \\varepsilon_{O_2} [O_2] + \\varepsilon_{CO_2} [CO_2] = (1.0)(0.21 C_{ox}) + (3.0)(0.79 C_{ox})\n$$\n$$\n[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]_{\\mathrm{OXY}} = (0.21 + 2.37) C_{ox} = 2.58 C_{ox}\n$$\nThe normalized effective third-body concentration is $\\tilde{M}_{\\mathrm{eff, OXY}} = 2.58$.\nThe net radical growth rate is:\n$$\n\\omega_{net, \\mathrm{OXY}} = k_b [O_2] - (100\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\tilde{M}_{\\mathrm{eff, OXY}}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_{net, \\mathrm{OXY}} = 300\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} - (100\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(2.58) = 300\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} - 258\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 42\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\n\n**5. Comparison of Flame Speeds**\nThe replacement of $N_2$ by $CO_2$ significantly increases the third-body termination rate, which in turn dramatically reduces the net radical growth rate $\\omega_{net}$ from $200\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ to $42\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. This suppression of the radical pool will reduce the laminar flame speed. We can calculate the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{S_{L,\\mathrm{OXY}}}{S_{L,\\mathrm{AIR}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{net, \\mathrm{OXY}}}{\\omega_{net, \\mathrm{AIR}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{42}{200}} = \\sqrt{0.21} \\approx 0.45826\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures, the ratio is approximately $0.46$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Replacing $N_2$ by $CO_2$ at fixed $[O_2]$ increases $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]$ for the $H+O_2+M$ recombination, thereby decreasing the net linear radical growth rate in the reaction zone. Under reaction–diffusion scaling, this reduction in the net linear rate reduces the laminar flame speed; with the parameters provided, the speed ratio $S_{L,\\mathrm{OXY}}/S_{L,\\mathrm{AIR}} \\approx 0.46$.**\n- Our analysis shows that $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]_{\\mathrm{OXY}} = 2.58 C_{ox}$ while $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]_{\\mathrm{AIR}} = 1.0 C_{ox}$, so $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]$ increases.\n- This increase in $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}]$ enhances the termination rate, reducing the net radical growth rate $\\omega_{net}$ from $200\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ to $42\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n- The reduction in $\\omega_{net}$ causes a reduction in the laminar flame speed $S_L$.\n- The calculated ratio of speeds is $\\approx 0.46$.\n- Every part of this statement is consistent with the derivation from the problem's premises.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Because $CO_2$ has lower heat capacity than $N_2$, its presence at fixed $[O_2]$ increases the adiabatic flame temperature, increasing the radical pool and the laminar flame speed even when its third-body efficiency is high.**\n- The premise that $CO_2$ has a lower heat capacity ($C_p$) than $N_2$ is factually incorrect for conditions relevant to flames. Due to its additional vibrational modes, $CO_2$ has a significantly higher molar heat capacity than $N_2$ at elevated temperatures.\n- Consequently, replacing $N_2$ with $CO_2$ would *decrease* the adiabatic flame temperature for a given stoichiometry, not increase it. The problem statement explicitly controls for this thermal effect by assuming $T_{ad}$ is held constant, but the physical reasoning in this option is flawed.\n- The conclusion that flame speed increases is contrary to our kinetic analysis.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. For a fixed $[O_2]$, three-body termination rates $H+O_2+M$ are independent of the diluent identity, so replacing $N_2$ by $CO_2$ leaves the radical pool and laminar flame speed unchanged.**\n- The termination rate depends on $[M_{\\mathrm{eff}}] = \\sum_i \\varepsilon_i [i]$. Since the third-body efficiency for $CO_2$ ($\\varepsilon_{CO_2} = 3.0$) is different from that of $N_2$ ($\\varepsilon_{N_2} = 1.0$), the termination rate is explicitly dependent on the diluent identity.\n- The premise is false, and as shown in the derivation, both the radical pool dynamics ($\\omega_{net}$) and the flame speed ($S_L$) are significantly altered.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In chemical looping combustion, $CO_2$ present in the fuel reactor acts only as an inert diluent with zero third-body efficiency in $H+O_2+M$ recombination, so it does not suppress chain branching or reduce flame speed.**\n- The premise that $CO_2$ has zero third-body efficiency is factually incorrect. The problem provides $\\varepsilon_{CO_2} = 3.0$, which reflects the well-known experimental fact that $CO_2$ is an effective third body in many recombination reactions.\n- Because its efficiency is significantly greater than zero (and greater than that of $N_2$), $CO_2$ strongly enhances the termination rate, which suppresses the net radical production and reduces the flame speed. The conclusion is therefore also false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**",
