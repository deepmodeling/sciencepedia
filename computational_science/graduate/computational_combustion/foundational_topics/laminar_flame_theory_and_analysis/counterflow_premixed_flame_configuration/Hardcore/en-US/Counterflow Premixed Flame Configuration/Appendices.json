            "problem": "Consider a steady planar counterflow configuration for a premixed gaseous mixture of constant density, modeled as an inviscid core flow between two opposed inlets separated by a fixed distance $L$ along the axial coordinate $x \\in [0, L]$. The left inlet at $x = 0$ issues a uniform inflow of speed $U_1  0$ directed in the $+x$ direction, and the right inlet at $x = L$ issues a uniform inflow of speed $U_2  0$ directed in the $-x$ direction. The stagnation plane is defined as the locus where the axial velocity component $u(x)$ vanishes.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the axial velocity profile and the location of the stagnation plane in a steady, planar, inviscid, constant-density counterflow configuration. The analysis is to be based on the fundamental principles of mass and momentum conservation, under the specific idealization that the flow in the core region can be modeled as having a spatially uniform axial strain rate.\n\nLet the axial coordinate be denoted by $x$, with the domain of interest being $x \\in [0, L]$. The left inlet is at $x=0$ and the right inlet is at $x=L$. The axial velocity component along the centerline is denoted by $u(x)$.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the axial velocity are provided by the inlet flow speeds:\n1. At the left inlet, $x=0$, the flow is in the $+x$ direction with speed $U_1$. Thus, the velocity condition is $u(0) = U_1$.\n2. At the right inlet, $x=L$, the flow is in the $-x$ direction with speed $U_2$. Thus, the velocity condition is $u(L) = -U_2$.\n\nThe problem states that a valid approximation for this flow field, consistent with the three-dimensional incompressible steady Euler equations, is a planar extensional flow with a spatially uniform axial strain rate. This is the crucial physical simplification. The axial strain rate is defined as the gradient of the axial velocity, $\\frac{du}{dx}$. The condition of spatial uniformity implies that this gradient is constant throughout the flow domain. Let us denote this constant strain rate by $a$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dx} = a\n$$\nwhere $a$ is a constant.\n\nThis first-order ordinary differential equation can be integrated with respect to $x$ to find the general form of the axial velocity profile $u(x)$:\n$$\nu(x) = \\int a \\, dx = ax + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. The velocity profile is therefore linear along the axial direction.\n\nThe two constants, $a$ and $C$, are determined by enforcing the boundary conditions at the two inlets.\n\nFirst, applying the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$\nu(0) = a(0) + C = U_1\n$$\nThis immediately yields the value of the integration constant $C$:\n$$\nC = U_1\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the general expression for $u(x)$, we have:\n$$\nu(x) = ax + U_1\n$$\nNext, we apply the boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\nu(L) = aL + U_1 = -U_2\n$$\nWe can now solve for the constant strain rate, $a$:\n$$\naL = -U_1 - U_2\n$$\n$$\na = -\\frac{U_1 + U_2}{L}\n$$\nSince $U_1  0$, $U_2  0$, and $L  0$, the strain rate $a$ is negative, which is physically consistent with a flow that is decelerating from the left inlet and converging towards a stagnation point.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $a$ back into the velocity profile equation, we obtain the complete and specific axial velocity profile along the centerline:\n$$\nu(x) = -\\left(\\frac{U_1 + U_2}{L}\\right)x + U_1\n$$\nThis expression describes the axial velocity at any position $x$ between the two inlets.\n\nThe stagnation plane is defined as the locus where the axial velocity component is zero. Let the position of this plane be $x_s$. By definition, $u(x_s) = 0$. We set the velocity profile expression to zero to find $x_s$:\n$$\n0 = -\\left(\\frac{U_1 + U_2}{L}\\right)x_s + U_1\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $x_s$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{U_1 + U_2}{L}\\right)x_s = U_1\n$$\n$$\nx_s = U_1 \\left(\\frac{L}{U_1 + U_2}\\right)\n$$\nThis gives the final closed-form expression for the position of the stagnation plane, measured from the left inlet at $x=0$, in terms of the given parameters $U_1$, $U_2$, and $L$. The problem further specifies that the result for $x_s$ should be in meters; given that $U_1$ and $U_2$ are speeds (e.g., in m/s) and $L$ is a distance (e.g., in m), the derived expression is dimensionally correct, yielding a result for $x_s$ in meters.\n$$\n[x_s] = \\frac{[\\text{m/s}] \\cdot [\\text{m}]}{[\\text{m/s}] + [\\text{m/s}]} = \\frac{[\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}]}{[\\text{m/s}]} = [\\text{m}]\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem asks for two main results: first, the derivation of an analytical expression for the scalar dissipation rate at the flame, $\\chi_{c}$, and second, an explanation of the role of the unity Lewis number assumption in this derivation.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Scalar Dissipation Rate at the Flame\n\nWe begin with the steady-state, one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation for the conserved scalar $Z(y)$, as provided in the problem statement:\n$$u(y)\\,\\frac{dZ}{dy} = D\\,\\frac{d^{2}Z}{dy^{2}}$$\nThe velocity field in the vicinity of the stagnation plane is given as $u(y) = -a\\,y$, where $a  0$ is the strain rate. Substituting this into the governing equation yields:\n$$-a\\,y\\,\\frac{dZ}{dy} = D\\,\\frac{d^{2}Z}{dy^{2}}$$\nThis is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it as:\n$$D\\,\\frac{d^{2}Z}{dy^{2}} + a\\,y\\,\\frac{dZ}{dy} = 0$$\nTo solve this equation, let us define an intermediate variable $W(y) = \\frac{dZ}{dy}$. The equation transforms into a first-order separable differential equation for $W(y)$:\n$$D\\,\\frac{dW}{dy} = -a\\,y\\,W$$\nSeparating variables, we get:\n$$\\frac{dW}{W} = -\\frac{a}{D}\\,y\\,dy$$\nIntegrating both sides gives:\n$$\\int \\frac{dW}{W} = \\int -\\frac{a}{D}\\,y\\,dy$$\n$$\\ln(W) = -\\frac{a}{2D}\\,y^{2} + C_{1}$$\nwhere $C_{1}$ is the constant of integration. Exponentiating both sides yields $W(y)$:\n$$W(y) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a}{2D}\\,y^{2} + C_{1}\\right) = C_{2}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a}{2D}\\,y^{2}\\right)$$\nwhere $C_{2} = \\exp(C_{1})$ is a new constant. Since $W(y) = \\frac{dZ}{dy}$, we can now find $Z(y)$ by integrating $W(y)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$Z(y) = \\int W(y)\\,dy = C_{2} \\int \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a}{2D}\\,y^{2}\\right)dy + C_{3}$$\nThe integral is related to the error function, $\\mathrm{erf}(x)$, which is defined as $\\mathrm{erf}(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{x} \\exp(-t^{2})\\,dt$. To utilize this, we perform a change of variables. Let $s = y\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}$, so $dy = \\sqrt{\\frac{2D}{a}}\\,ds$. The solution for $Z(y)$ becomes:\n$$Z(y) = C_{2} \\int \\exp(-s^2) \\sqrt{\\frac{2D}{a}}\\,ds + C_{3} = C_{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2D}{a}}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}\\,\\mathrm{erf}(s)\\right) + C_{3}$$\n$$Z(y) = C_{A}\\,\\mathrm{erf}\\left(y\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}\\right) + C_{B}$$\nwhere $C_{A}$ and $C_{B}$ are new constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are $Z(y) \\to 0$ as $y \\to -\\infty$ and $Z(y) \\to 1$ as $y \\to +\\infty$. We use the limits of the error function: $\\mathrm{erf}(x) \\to -1$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and $\\mathrm{erf}(x) \\to 1$ as $x \\to +\\infty$.\nApplying the first boundary condition ($y \\to -\\infty$):\n$$0 = C_{A}\\,(-1) + C_{B} \\implies C_{B} = C_{A}$$\nApplying the second boundary condition ($y \\to +\\infty$):\n$$1 = C_{A}\\,(1) + C_{B}$$\nSubstituting $C_{B} = C_{A}$ into the second equation gives:\n$$1 = C_{A} + C_{A} = 2C_{A} \\implies C_{A} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThus, $C_{B} = \\frac{1}{2}$. The full solution for the scalar profile is:\n$$Z(y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{erf}\\left(y\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[1 + \\mathrm{erf}\\left(y\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}\\right)\\right]$$\nThe problem states that the flame is located at $y_{f}$ where $Z(y_{f}) = 1/2$. Let's find this location:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[1 + \\mathrm{erf}\\left(y_{f}\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}\\right)\\right]$$\n$$1 = 1 + \\mathrm{erf}\\left(y_{f}\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}\\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{erf}\\left(y_{f}\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}\\right) = 0$$\nSince $\\mathrm{erf}(0) = 0$, the argument of the error function must be zero. As $a  0$ and $D  0$, this implies $y_{f}=0$. So, the flame is located at the stagnation plane.\n\nNext, we calculate the scalar dissipation rate, $\\chi(y) = 2D\\left(\\frac{dZ}{dy}\\right)^{2}$. We first need the derivative $\\frac{dZ}{dy}$:\n$$\\frac{dZ}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left[\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{erf}\\left(y\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}\\right)\\right]$$\nUsing the chain rule and the derivative of the error function, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\mathrm{erf}(u) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\exp(-u^{2})\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$$\\frac{dZ}{dy} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\left(y\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}\\right)^{2}\\right) \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}}$$\n$$\\frac{dZ}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a}{2D}y^{2}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2\\pi D}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a}{2D}y^{2}\\right)$$\nNow we compute $\\chi(y)$:\n$$\\chi(y) = 2D \\left(\\frac{dZ}{dy}\\right)^{2} = 2D \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2\\pi D}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a}{2D}y^{2}\\right)\\right]^{2}$$\n$$\\chi(y) = 2D \\left( \\frac{a}{2\\pi D} \\right) \\exp\\left(-2 \\cdot \\frac{a}{2D}y^{2}\\right) = \\frac{a}{\\pi}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a}{D}y^{2}\\right)$$\nThe scalar dissipation rate at the flame, $\\chi_{c}$, is this expression evaluated at the flame location $y_{f}=0$:\n$$\\chi_{c} = \\chi(y_{f}=0) = \\frac{a}{\\pi}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a}{D}(0)^{2}\\right) = \\frac{a}{\\pi}\\exp(0)$$\n$$\\chi_{c} = \\frac{a}{\\pi}$$\nThe strain rate $a$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, so $\\chi_{c}$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ as required.\n\n### Part 2: Role of the Unity Lewis Number Assumption\n\nThe derivation of the expression $\\chi_c = a/\\pi$ is the scalar dissipation rate for a passive scalar at the stagnation plane ($y=0$). The crucial assumption that links this specific location and value to the *flame* is the statement that \"one may take the flame location as the plane where $Z=1/2$\". The problem explicitly states this is a consequence of the unity Lewis number ($Le=1$) limit.\n\n1.  **Modeling Assumption Reliant on $Le=1$**: The key assumption is that the flame front, a thermo-chemical structure defined by a peak in temperature and reaction rate, is spatially co-located with the $Z=1/2$ iso-surface of the passive scalar field. For the symmetric flow considered, the $Z=1/2$ iso-surface is at the stagnation plane $y=0$. Thus, the assumption is that the flame is located exactly at the stagnation plane, $y_{f}=0$.\n\n2.  **Why this holds for $Le=1$**: The Lewis number is the ratio of thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$, to mass diffusivity, $D$, so $Le = \\alpha/D$. When $Le=1$, we have $\\alpha = D$. The transport equation for temperature $T$ (ignoring the heat release term for a moment) is homologous to the transport equation for the scalar $Z$:\n    $$u(y)\\frac{dZ}{dy} = D\\frac{d^2Z}{dy^2}$$\n    $$u(y)\\frac{dT}{dy} = \\alpha\\frac{d^2T}{dy^2} = D\\frac{d^2T}{dy^2} \\quad (\\text{for } Le=1)$$\n    Because heat and the passive scalar are transported by convection and diffusion in an identical manner, the normalized temperature profile is directly coupled to the $Z$ profile. In the thin-flame limit, the flame sheet acts as a source plane for heat. For a symmetric configuration like this, where two identical premixed streams meet, the temperature peak (the flame) naturally stabilizes on the plane of symmetry, which is the stagnation plane $y=0$. As we derived, this is also the location where $Z=1/2$. Thus, for $Le=1$, the flame location $y_f$ coincides with the $Z=1/2$ iso-surface.\n\n3.  **Breakdown for $Le \\neq 1$**: When the Lewis number is not unity ($Le \\neq 1$), thermal diffusivity is not equal to mass diffusivity ($\\alpha \\neq D$). This phenomenon is known as preferential diffusion.\n    -   The transport equations for heat and the scalar $Z$ are no longer homologous. The temperature field becomes decoupled from the scalar field.\n    -   The flame's position is determined by the balance between the incoming flow velocity and the laminar flame speed, $S_L$. The flame stabilizes at a position $y_f$ where $|u(y_f)| = |-a\\,y_f| = S_L$.\n    -   Crucially, the laminar flame speed $S_L$ itself is strongly dependent on the Lewis number. Preferential diffusion of heat towards or away from the reaction zone, relative to the diffusion of reactants, alters the flame temperature and structure, thereby changing $S_L$.\n    -   As a result, the flame position $y_f$ will shift away from the stagnation plane ($y=0$) to a new location $y_f = \\pm S_L(Le)/a$. Since $y_f \\neq 0$, the flame is no longer on the $Z=1/2$ iso-surface.\n    -   Consequently, the assumption $y_f = 0$ breaks down. The scalar dissipation rate *at the flame* would be $\\chi_c = \\chi(y_f) = \\frac{a}{\\pi}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a}{D}y_f^{2}\\right)$, which is no longer equal to $a/\\pi$.\n\nIn summary, the assumption that the flame is at the $Z=1/2$ location is a direct consequence of the identical transport of heat and mass when $Le=1$. This assumption fails when $Le \\neq 1$ due to preferential diffusion, which shifts the flame's position away from the stagnation plane.",

This gives a system of two linear equations for the coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$C_1 + C_2 = 1$$\n$$\\frac{C_1}{6} + \\frac{4C_2}{6} = 0 \\implies C_1 + 4C_2 = 0$$\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives $3C_2 = -1$, so $C_2 = -\\frac{1}{3}$.\nSubstituting $C_2$ into the first equation gives $C_1 - \\frac{1}{3} = 1$, so $C_1 = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\nThe resulting estimator for $a$ is:\n$$a_{est} = \\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{u(h) - u(-h)}{2h} \\right) - \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{u(2h) - u(-2h)}{4h} \\right)$$\n$$a_{est} = \\frac{2}{3h} (u(h) - u(-h)) - \\frac{1}{12h} (u(2h) - u(-2h))$$\nCombining terms, we get the fourth-order accurate finite-difference formula:\n$$a_{est} = \\frac{1}{12h} \\left[ 8(u(h) - u(-h)) - (u(2h) - u(-2h)) \\right]$$\n$$a_{est} = \\frac{1}{12h} \\left[ u(-2h) - 8u(-h) + 8u(h) - u(2h) \\right]$$\nNote that the coefficient for $u(0)$ is zero, which is consistent with exploiting the odd symmetry and makes the estimator robust to the noise in the $u(0)$ measurement. The leading truncation error for this estimator is $O(h^4)$.\n\nNow, we compute the best-estimate of $a$ using the given data:\n$h = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$u(-2h) = -0.159\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$u(-h) = -0.112\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$u(h) = 0.109\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$u(2h) = 0.161\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\n$$a = \\frac{1}{12 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})} \\left[ (-0.159) - 8(-0.112) + 8(0.109) - (0.161) \\right]$$\n$$a = \\frac{1}{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}} \\left[ -0.159 + 0.896 + 0.872 - 0.161 \\right]$$\n$$a = \\frac{1}{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}} \\left[ 1.448 \\right]$$\n$$a = \\frac{1.448}{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1448}{1.2} = \\frac{3620}{3} \\approx 1206.66... \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we quantify the uncertainty of this estimate. The estimator is a linear function of the measured velocities $u_i = u(x_i)$. Let the estimator be $a = \\sum_i k_i u_i$. The coefficients are:\n$k_{-2} = \\frac{1}{12h}$, $k_{-1} = \\frac{-8}{12h}$, $k_{1} = \\frac{8}{12h}$, $k_{2} = \\frac{-1}{12h}$.\nThe standard deviation of each velocity measurement is $\\sigma_u = 0.002\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Since the errors are independent, the variance of the estimate, $\\sigma_a^2$, is given by the linear uncertainty propagation formula:\n$$\\sigma_a^2 = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial u_i} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{u_i}^2 = \\sum_i k_i^2 \\sigma_u^2$$\n$$\\sigma_a^2 = \\sigma_u^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{12h}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{-8}{12h}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{8}{12h}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{-1}{12h}\\right)^2 \\right]$$\n$$\\sigma_a^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_u^2}{(12h)^2} [1^2 + (-8)^2 + 8^2 + (-1)^2] = \\frac{\\sigma_u^2}{(12h)^2} [1 + 64 + 64 + 1] = \\frac{130 \\sigma_u^2}{(12h)^2}$$\nThe standard uncertainty $\\sigma_a$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\sigma_a = \\sqrt{\\frac{130 \\sigma_u^2}{(12h)^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{130} \\sigma_u}{12h}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\sigma_a = \\frac{\\sqrt{130} \\times (0.002)}{12 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})} = \\frac{0.002 \\sqrt{130}}{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{130}}{1.2} = \\frac{5}{3} \\sqrt{130} \\approx 19.003\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe best estimate for the strain rate is $a = 1206.66...\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, with a standard uncertainty of approximately $19\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The question asks for the best-estimate of $a$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$a \\approx 1207\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThis result is reported as the final answer.",
