            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, steady, planar, premixed, laminar flame propagating into a uniform unburned mixture at constant pressure. The flame is adiabatic and there is no external work or radiative loss. In the computational combustion formulation where the laminar flame speed emerges as an eigenvalue of the coupled reactive-diffusive system, the far-field burned temperature serves as a boundary condition that must be determined from thermochemistry.\n\nStarting from the First Law of Thermodynamics for a steady flow control volume and the definition of specific enthalpy, show that for an adiabatic, constant-pressure planar flame, the sum of sensible enthalpy and chemical (formation) enthalpy per unit mass is conserved across the flame.

            "solution": "The analysis of the problem is divided into two parts as requested: first, a derivation showing the conservation of total enthalpy across the flame, and second, the calculation of the final burned gas temperature, $T_b$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Enthalpy Conservation\n\nWe consider a control volume enclosing the one-dimensional, steady, planar flame. The inlet of the control volume is in the unburned mixture (state $u$) and the outlet is in the burned products (state $b$). The First Law of Thermodynamics for a steady-state, steady-flow process is:\n$$\n\\dot{Q}_{cv} - \\dot{W}_{cv} = \\sum_{\\text{out}} \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}} \\left(h + \\frac{1}{2}V^2 + gz\\right)_{\\text{out}} - \\sum_{\\text{in}} \\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} \\left(h + \\frac{1}{2}V^2 + gz\\right)_{\\text{in}}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{Q}_{cv}$ is the rate of heat transfer into the control volume, $\\dot{W}_{cv}$ is the rate of work done by the control volume (shaft work), $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate, $h$ is the specific enthalpy, $V$ is the velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $z$ is the elevation.\n\nFor a one-dimensional flow, the conservation of mass requires $\\dot{m}_{\\text{in}} = \\dot{m}_{\\text{out}} = \\dot{m}$. The energy equation can then be written per unit mass:\n$$\nq - w = (h_b - h_u) + \\frac{1}{2}(V_b^2 - V_u^2) + g(z_b - z_u)\n$$\nwhere $q = \\dot{Q}_{cv}/\\dot{m}$ and $w = \\dot{W}_{cv}/\\dot{m}$.\n\nThe problem states several conditions which simplify this equation:\n1.  The flame is adiabatic, so there is no heat transfer to the surroundings: $q = 0$.\n2.  There is no external work, which in this context means no shaft work: $w = 0$.\n3.  For a low-speed combustion wave such as a laminar flame, the change in kinetic energy is negligible compared to the enormous change in chemical enthalpy. Thus, we assume $\\frac{1}{2}(V_b^2 - V_u^2) \\approx 0$.\n4.  Similarly, the change in potential energy is assumed to be zero or negligible: $g(z_b - z_u) = 0$.\n\nApplying these conditions to the energy equation yields:\n$$\n0 - 0 = (h_b - h_u) + 0 + 0\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nh_u = h_b\n$$\nThis result states that the specific enthalpy of the mixture is conserved across the flame.\n\nThe specific enthalpy $h$ of a mixture is the sum of the specific enthalpies of its constituent species, weighted by their mass fractions. For any single species, the specific enthalpy at a temperature $T$ can be expressed as the sum of its standard specific enthalpy of formation at a reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}}$ (the chemical enthalpy), denoted $h_f^0$, and its sensible enthalpy change from $T_{\\text{ref}}$ to $T$:\n$$\nh(T) = h_f^0 + h_{\\text{sens}}(T) = h_f^0 + \\int_{T_{\\text{ref}}}^T c_p(T') dT'\n$$\nwhere $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure.\nTherefore, the conservation law $h_u = h_b$ directly shows that the sum of the sensible enthalpy and the chemical (formation) enthalpy per unit mass is conserved across the flame. This completes the required derivation.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Burned Temperature $T_b$\n\nFrom the conservation of enthalpy, $h_u = h_b$, we can write the energy balance for the mixture:\n$$\nh_{\\text{mixture}, u}(T_u) = h_{\\text{mixture}, b}(T_b)\n$$\nExpanding this using the definition of enthalpy, where $(h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}}$ is the mass-weighted enthalpy of formation of the mixture:\n$$\n(h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} + \\int_{T_{\\text{ref}}}^{T_u} c_{p,u}(T') dT' = (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} + \\int_{T_{\\text{ref}}}^{T_b} c_{p,b}(T') dT'\n$$\nThe problem states that the specific heats of the unburned mixture, $c_{p,u}$, and the burned mixture, $c_{p,b}$, can be taken as constant. The integrals simplify:\n$$\n(h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} + c_{p,u}(T_u - T_{\\text{ref}}) = (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} + c_{p,b}(T_b - T_{\\text{ref}})\n$$\nRearranging to solve for the burned gas temperature $T_b$:\n$$\nc_{p,b}(T_b - T_{\\text{ref}}) = \\left[ (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} - (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} \\right] + c_{p,u}(T_u - T_{\\text{ref}})\n$$\nThe term $\\left[ (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} - (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} \\right]$ represents the heat released during the combustion of a unit mass of the mixture at the reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}}$. This quantity is related to the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel, $q_L$, which is given per unit mass of fuel. The relationship is through the mass fraction of the fuel in the unburned mixture, $Y_{F,u}$:\n$$\n(h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, u} - (h_f^0)_{\\text{mix}, b} = Y_{F,u} \\cdot q_L\n$$\nSubstituting this into the energy balance gives:\n$$\nc_{p,b}(T_b - T_{\\text{ref}}) = Y_{F,u} \\cdot q_L + c_{p,u}(T_u - T_{\\text{ref}})\n$$\nSo, the final equation for $T_b$ is:\n$$\nT_b = T_{\\text{ref}} + \\frac{Y_{F,u} \\cdot q_L + c_{p,u}(T_u - T_{\\text{ref}})}{c_{p,b}}\n$$\nTo use this equation, we first need to calculate the fuel mass fraction $Y_{F,u}$. The stoichiometric reactant mixture is given as $1$ mole of $\\text{CH}_4$, $2$ moles of $\\text{O}_2$, and $7.52$ moles of $\\text{N}_2$. Using the provided molar masses:\n-   Mass of $\\text{CH}_4$: $m_{\\text{CH}_4} = 1\\,\\text{mol} \\times 16\\,\\text{g/mol} = 16\\,\\text{g}$.\n-   Mass of $\\text{O}_2$: $m_{\\text{O}_2} = 2\\,\\text{mol} \\times 32\\,\\text{g/mol} = 64\\,\\text{g}$.\n-   Mass of $\\text{N}_2$: $m_{\\text{N}_2} = 7.52\\,\\text{mol} \\times 28\\,\\text{g/mol} = 210.56\\,\\text{g}$.\n\nThe total mass of the unburned mixture corresponding to $1$ mole of fuel is:\n$$\nm_{\\text{mix}} = m_{\\text{CH}_4} + m_{\\text{O}_2} + m_{\\text{N}_2} = 16\\,\\text{g} + 64\\,\\text{g} + 210.56\\,\\text{g} = 290.56\\,\\text{g}\n$$\nThe fuel mass fraction is then:\n$$\nY_{F,u} = \\frac{m_{\\text{CH}_4}}{m_{\\text{mix}}} = \\frac{16\\,\\text{g}}{290.56\\,\\text{g}} = \\frac{16}{290.56}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given values into the equation for $T_b$:\n-   $Y_{F,u} = 16/290.56$\n-   $q_L = 5.00 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{J/kg}$\n-   $c_{p,u} = 1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n-   $c_{p,b} = 1.20 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n-   $T_u = 300\\,\\text{K}$\n-   $T_{\\text{ref}} = 298\\,\\text{K}$\n\n$$\nT_b = 298\\,\\text{K} + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{16}{290.56}\\right) \\cdot (5.00 \\times 10^7\\,\\text{J/kg}) + (1.00 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(300\\,\\text{K} - 298\\,\\text{K})}{1.20 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 298 + \\frac{\\left(\\frac{16 \\times 5.00 \\times 10^7}{290.56}\\right) + (1000 \\times 2)}{1200}\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 298 + \\frac{2753303.96... + 2000}{1200}\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 298 + \\frac{2755303.96...}{1200}\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 298 + 2296.0866...\n$$\n$$\nT_b = 2594.0866...\\,\\text{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nT_b = 2594\\,\\text{K}\n$$",

Since $\\omega = \\rho A (\\dots)$ and $\\rho \\propto p$, we have $\\omega \\propto p \\cdot A$. For a second-order reaction, $\\omega \\propto p^2$, which implies $p \\cdot A \\propto p^2$, thus $A \\propto p$, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nNow, we substitute these pressure dependencies into our scaling law for $(\\rho_u S_L)^2$:\n$$\n(\\rho_u S_L)^2 \\propto (p^2) \\cdot (p^{-1}) \\cdot (p^1)\n$$\nCombining the exponents on the right side gives:\n$$\n(\\rho_u S_L)^2 \\propto p^{2 - 1 + 1} = p^2\n$$\nThe left side of the relation is $(\\rho_u S_L)^2$. Since $\\rho_u \\propto p$, this term scales as:\n$$\n(\\rho_u S_L)^2 \\propto (p \\cdot S_L)^2 = p^2 S_L^2\n$$\nEquating the scaling of both sides:\n$$\np^2 S_L^2 \\propto p^2\n$$\nDividing by $p^2$ shows that $S_L^2$ must be independent of pressure:\n$$\nS_L^2 \\propto p^0\n$$\nTaking the square root, we find the scaling for the laminar flame speed itself:\n$$\nS_L \\propto p^0\n$$\nThis implies that the pressure-scaling exponent $\\alpha$ is $0$.\n$$\n\\alpha = 0\n$$\n\n**Qualitative Comparison with Experimental Data:**\n\nThe derived result, $S_L \\propto p^0$, predicts that the laminar flame speed is independent of pressure. This prediction is a direct consequence of the assumption that the global reaction kinetics are second-order ($A \\propto p$).\n\nHowever, experimental measurements for methane-air flames, and hydrocarbon-air flames in general, show that the laminar flame speed *decreases* as pressure increases. The experimentally observed pressure exponent $\\alpha$ is negative, typically in the range of $-0.5  \\alpha  -0.1$.\n\nThe discrepancy between the simple theoretical prediction and experimental results arises primarily from the oversimplified kinetic model. Real combustion chemistry for methane involves a large number of elementary reactions. The concept of a single \"overall reaction order\" is an approximation. The effective reaction order for methane combustion is not exactly $2$ and, more importantly, it changes with pressure. At higher pressures, three-body chain-termination reactions (e.g., $\\text{H} + \\text{O}_2 + \\text{M} \\to \\text{HO}_2 + \\text{M}$, where $\\text{M}$ is any third body) become more significant. These reactions consume key radical species like $\\text{H}$, thereby reducing the overall reaction rate. This effect leads to an effective global reaction order $n$ that is less than $2$.\n\nIf we use the more general scaling law for an arbitrary reaction order $n$, $S_L \\propto p^{(n-2)/2}$, an effective order of $n  2$ results in a negative exponent $\\alpha$, which correctly predicts a decrease in flame speed with increasing pressure. For instance, an effective order of $n=1.8$ would yield $\\alpha = (1.8-2)/2 = -0.1$, which is within the range of experimental observations.\n\nTherefore, the derived scaling of $\\alpha=0$ **disagrees** with experimental trends. The reason for the disagreement is the idealized assumption of simple second-order kinetics, which fails to capture the increasing importance of chain-terminating reactions at higher pressures in real flame chemistry.",
