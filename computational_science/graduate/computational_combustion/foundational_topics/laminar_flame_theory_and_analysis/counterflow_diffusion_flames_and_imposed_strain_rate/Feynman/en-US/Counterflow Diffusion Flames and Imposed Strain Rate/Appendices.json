This exercise provides a direct physical interpretation of this crucial parameter by deriving its relationship with the easily measurable inlet velocities and nozzle separation distance .

            "problem": "Consider a planar opposed-jet configuration for a counterflow diffusion flame in which two semi-infinite, uniform-velocity streams face each other across a gap of width $L$. The left nozzle at $x=-L/2$ issues a fuel stream of constant speed $U_f0$ directed in the $+x$ direction, and the right nozzle at $x=+L/2$ issues an oxidizer stream of constant speed $U_o0$ directed in the $-x$ direction. Assume steady, low-Mach-number, constant-density flow and neglect the feedback of heat release on the hydrodynamics so that the base flow is determined kinematically by the opposed jets. Define the stagnation plane as the location $x=x_s$ where the axial velocity component $u(x)$ vanishes. Define the imposed axial strain rate $a$ to be the magnitude of the axial velocity gradient at the stagnation plane, $a \\equiv -\\left.\\frac{du}{dx}\\right|_{x=x_s}0$.\n\nUnder the standard near-stagnation similarity assumption for planar counterflow that, in the core between the two inlets, the axial velocity profile is linear in the distance from the stagnation plane, i.e., $u(x)$ is well-approximated by a linear function of $(x-x_s)$, use only basic kinematics consistent with steady, constant-density flow to derive a closed-form expression that links the imposed strain rate $a$ to the inlet speeds $(U_f,U_o)$ and the separation $L$. State clearly any intermediate quantities you introduce, and eliminate them in favor of $(U_f,U_o,L)$ in the final expression. Express your final answer for $a$ in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. No numerical evaluation or rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the imposed axial strain rate, $a$, in a planar opposed-jet counterflow configuration. The derivation will be based on the provided kinematic assumptions.\n\nThe fundamental assumption stated in the problem is that in the core region between the two nozzles, the axial velocity profile $u(x)$ is a linear function of the distance from the stagnation plane, $x_s$. The stagnation plane is defined as the location where the axial velocity vanishes, $u(x_s) = 0$. We can express this linear relationship as:\n$$\nu(x) = C(x - x_s)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality. This form automatically satisfies the condition $u(x_s) = 0$.\n\nThe imposed axial strain rate, $a$, is defined as the magnitude of the velocity gradient at the stagnation plane:\n$$\na \\equiv -\\left.\\frac{du}{dx}\\right|_{x=x_s}\n$$\nThe negative sign is included in the definition to ensure that $a > 0$ for a flow that is compressing along the $x$-axis around the stagnation point. We can find the derivative of our assumed velocity profile:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}[C(x - x_s)] = C\n$$\nSince the derivative is constant for a linear function, the gradient at any point $x$, including at $x=x_s$, is equal to $C$. Therefore, we can relate the constant $C$ to the strain rate $a$:\n$$\na = -C\n$$\nSubstituting $C = -a$ back into the expression for the velocity profile, we obtain the axial velocity as a function of the strain rate $a$ and the stagnation plane position $x_s$:\n$$\nu(x) = -a(x - x_s)\n$$\nThis is the kinematic model for the velocity field that we will use. It contains two unknown parameters: the strain rate $a$ and the stagnation plane position $x_s$. To solve for these, we must apply the boundary conditions given at the two nozzle exits.\n\nThe problem specifies the following boundary conditions:\n1.  At the fuel nozzle exit, located at $x = -L/2$, the velocity is $U_f$ in the positive $x$-direction. Thus, $u(-L/2) = U_f$.\n2.  At the oxidizer nozzle exit, located at $x = +L/2$, the velocity is $U_o$ in the negative $x$-direction. Thus, $u(+L/2) = -U_o$.\n\nWe now apply these two boundary conditions to our velocity model, $u(x) = -a(x-x_s)$, which yields a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns, $a$ and $x_s$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition (fuel side):\n$$\nu\\left(-\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = U_f \\implies U_f = -a\\left(-\\frac{L}{2} - x_s\\right)\n$$\n$$\nU_f = a\\left(\\frac{L}{2} + x_s\\right) \\quad \\quad (1)\n$$\n\nApplying the second boundary condition (oxidizer side):\n$$\nu\\left(+\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = -U_o \\implies -U_o = -a\\left(\\frac{L}{2} - x_s\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-U_o = a\\left(x_s - \\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\quad \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nWe have a system of two equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nU_f = a x_s + \\frac{aL}{2} \\\\\n-U_o = a x_s - \\frac{aL}{2}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nOur goal is to find an expression for $a$. We can eliminate the intermediate quantity $x_s$ by subtracting the second equation from the first:\n$$\nU_f - (-U_o) = \\left(a x_s + \\frac{aL}{2}\\right) - \\left(a x_s - \\frac{aL}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nU_f + U_o = a x_s + \\frac{aL}{2} - a x_s + \\frac{aL}{2}\n$$\n$$\nU_f + U_o = aL\n$$\nSolving for the strain rate $a$, we find:\n$$\na = \\frac{U_f + U_o}{L}\n$$\nThis expression relates the imposed strain rate $a$ directly to the inlet speeds $U_f$ and $U_o$ and the separation distance $L$, as required. The units are consistent: if speeds are in $\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$ and distance is in $\\mathrm{m}$, the strain rate $a$ is in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. All intermediate quantities have been eliminated in the final expression. For completeness, we could also solve for the stagnation plane position $x_s$ by adding the two equations, which yields $x_s = \\frac{L}{2} \\frac{U_f - U_o}{U_f + U_o}$, confirming its dependence on the relative momentum of the jets.

The left (fuel) stream enters with mass fractions $Y_{F,1}$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1}$ of the fuel $F$ and oxygen $\\mathrm{O_2}$, respectively, and the right (oxidizer) stream enters with mass fractions $Y_{F,2}$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2}$ of the same two species.

Provide your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for $Z_{st}$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the stoichiometric mixture fraction, $Z_{st}$, for a counterflow diffusion flame. The derivation will be based on the principles of mass conservation, the definition of the mixture fraction as a conserved scalar, and the definition of stoichiometry.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the local mass fractions of fuel and oxidizer and the mixture fraction, $Z$. The problem states that $Z$ is a conserved scalar, with $Z=1$ in the fuel stream (stream $1$) and $Z=0$ in the oxidizer stream (stream $2$). Under the assumption of equal molecular diffusivities (unity Lewis number), any conserved scalar, including the elemental mass fractions, varies linearly with $Z$. Consequently, the \"unreacted\" mass fractions of fuel ($Y_F^u$) and oxygen ($Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^u$)—that is, the mass fractions that would exist at a given location due to mixing alone, without any chemical reaction—also vary linearly with $Z$. These are given by:\n$$Y_F^u(Z) = Z \\cdot Y_{F,1} + (1-Z) \\cdot Y_{F,2}$$\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^u(Z) = Z \\cdot Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1} + (1-Z) \\cdot Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2}$$\nwhere $Y_{F,1}$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1}$ are the mass fractions at the fuel stream inlet, and $Y_{F,2}$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2}$ are the mass fractions at the oxidizer stream inlet.\n\nNext, we establish the stoichiometric condition on a mass basis. The single-step global reaction is given on a molar basis:\n$$F + s\\,\\mathrm{O_2} \\to \\text{products}$$\nHere, $1$ mole of fuel $F$ reacts with $s$ moles of oxygen $\\mathrm{O_2}$. The quantity $s$ is the molar stoichiometric coefficient. To convert this to a mass relationship, we use the molecular weights of the fuel, $W_F$, and oxygen, $W_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$. The mass of fuel reacting is proportional to $1 \\cdot W_F$, and the mass of oxygen reacting is proportional to $s \\cdot W_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$. The stoichiometric mass ratio, $\\nu$, is the mass of oxygen required to completely consume a unit mass of fuel:\n$$\\nu = \\frac{\\text{mass of } \\mathrm{O_2} \\text{ consumed}}{\\text{mass of } F \\text{ consumed}} = \\frac{s \\cdot W_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}{1 \\cdot W_F} = \\frac{s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}{W_F}$$\n\nThe stoichiometric mixture fraction, $Z_{st}$, is the specific value of $Z$ at which the unreacted fuel and oxygen are present in exactly this stoichiometric ratio. At the location where $Z=Z_{st}$, the ratio of the available (unreacted) mass fractions must equal the stoichiometric mass ratio:\n$$\\frac{Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^u(Z_{st})}{Y_F^u(Z_{st})} = \\nu$$\n\nSubstituting the linear expressions for $Y_F^u(Z)$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^u(Z)$ into this condition, we get:\n$$\\frac{Z_{st} Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1} + (1-Z_{st}) Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2}}{Z_{st} Y_{F,1} + (1-Z_{st}) Y_{F,2}} = \\nu = \\frac{s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}{W_F}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $Z_{st}$. First, cross-multiply:\n$$W_F \\left( Z_{st} Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1} + (1-Z_{st}) Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2} \\right) = s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\left( Z_{st} Y_{F,1} + (1-Z_{st}) Y_{F,2} \\right)$$\nExpand the terms:\n$$W_F Z_{st} Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1} + W_F Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2} - W_F Z_{st} Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2} = s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} Z_{st} Y_{F,1} + s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} Y_{F,2} - s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} Z_{st} Y_{F,2}$$\nGroup all terms containing $Z_{st}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$Z_{st} \\left( W_F Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1} - W_F Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2} - s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} Y_{F,1} + s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} Y_{F,2} \\right) = s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} Y_{F,2} - W_F Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2}$$\nIsolating $Z_{st}$ gives:\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} Y_{F,2} - W_F Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2}}{s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} (Y_{F,2} - Y_{F,1}) + W_F (Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1} - Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2})}$$\nTo obtain a more standard form, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $-1$:\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{W_F Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2} - s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} Y_{F,2}}{s W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} (Y_{F,1} - Y_{F,2}) - W_F (Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1} - Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2})}$$\n\nThe problem requires an explicit expression for the molar stoichiometric coefficient $s$. The fuel has the empirical formula $\\mathrm{C}_{n_C}\\mathrm{H}_{n_H}\\mathrm{O}_{n_O}$. Assuming complete combustion, the products are carbon dioxide ($\\mathrm{CO_2}$) and water ($\\mathrm{H_2O}$). The balanced chemical equation is:\n$$\\mathrm{C}_{n_C}\\mathrm{H}_{n_H}\\mathrm{O}_{n_O} + s\\,\\mathrm{O_2} \\to n_C\\,\\mathrm{CO_2} + \\frac{n_H}{2}\\,\\mathrm{H_2O}$$\nWe determine $s$ by balancing the oxygen atoms. The number of oxygen atoms on the left side is $n_O + 2s$, and on the right side is $2n_C + \\frac{n_H}{2}$. Equating these gives:\n$$n_O + 2s = 2n_C + \\frac{n_H}{2}$$\nSolving for $s$:\n$$2s = 2n_C + \\frac{n_H}{2} - n_O$$\n$$s = n_C + \\frac{n_H}{4} - \\frac{n_O}{2}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $s$ into our equation for $Z_{st}$ to obtain the final closed-form expression in terms of the specified variables:\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{W_F Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2} - \\left(n_C + \\frac{n_H}{4} - \\frac{n_O}{2}\\right) W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} Y_{F,2}}{\\left(n_C + \\frac{n_H}{4} - \\frac{n_O}{2}\\right) W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} (Y_{F,1} - Y_{F,2}) - W_F (Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},1} - Y_{\\mathrm{O_2},2})}$$\nThis expression is the complete and final solution, derived from first principles as requested.

The expression for the adiabatic flame temperature is:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{ad}} = T_0 + \\frac{-\\Delta H_R^0 + \\sum_{i \\in \\text{reactants}} n_i c_{p,i}(T_i - T_0)}{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{products}} n_j c_{p,j}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values for the terms in this expression.\nThe standard enthalpy of reaction, $\\Delta H_R^0$, for the consumption of $2.1~\\mathrm{mol}$ of $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta H_R^0 = \\sum_{j \\in \\text{products}} n_j h_{f,j}^0 - \\sum_{i \\in \\text{reactants}} n_i h_{f,i}^0\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_R^0 = [n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}h_{f,\\mathrm{CO_2}}^0 + n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}h_{f,\\mathrm{H_2O}}^0] - [n_{\\mathrm{CH_4}}h_{f,\\mathrm{CH_4}}^0 + n_{\\mathrm{O_2}}h_{f,\\mathrm{O_2}}^0]\n$$\n(Note that the inert $\\mathrm{N_2}$ does not contribute as $n_{\\mathrm{N_2,R}} = n_{\\mathrm{N_2,P}}$ and $h_{f,\\mathrm{N_2}}^0=0$)\n$$\n\\Delta H_R^0 = [2.1(-393.52) + 4.2(-241.82)] - [2.1(-74.85) + 4.2(0)]~\\mathrm{kJ}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_R^0 = [-826.392 - 1015.644] - [-157.185]~\\mathrm{kJ} = -1842.036 + 157.185 = -1684.851~\\mathrm{kJ}\n$$\nSo, the heat released is $-\\Delta H_R^0 = 1684.851~\\mathrm{kJ}$ or $1684851~\\mathrm{J}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total sensible enthalpy of the reactants relative to $T_0 = 298~\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\nH_{\\text{sens,R}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{reactants}} n_i c_{p,i}(T_i - T_0)\n$$\n$$\nH_{\\text{sens,R}} = [n_{\\mathrm{CH_4}}c_{p,\\mathrm{CH_4}} + n_{\\mathrm{N_2,F}}c_{p,\\mathrm{N_2}}](T_F-T_0) + [n_{\\mathrm{O_2}}c_{p,\\mathrm{O_2}} + n_{\\mathrm{N_2,O}}c_{p,\\mathrm{N_2}}](T_O-T_0)\n$$\n$$\nH_{\\text{sens,R}} = [2.1(35.0) + 4.9(34.0)](500-298) + [4.2(36.0) + 15.8(34.0)](900-298)\n$$\n$$\nH_{\\text{sens,R}} = [73.5 + 166.6](202) + [151.2 + 537.2](602)\n$$\n$$\nH_{\\text{sens,R}} = (240.1)(202) + (688.4)(602) = 48500.2 + 414416.8 = 462917~\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nThe numerator of the fraction for $T_{\\mathrm{ad}}$ is the sum of the heat release and the reactants' sensible enthalpy:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = -\\Delta H_R^0 + H_{\\text{sens,R}} = 1684851 + 462917 = 2147768~\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the denominator, which is the total heat capacity of the product mixture:\n$$\n\\sum_{j \\in \\text{products}} n_j c_{p,j} = n_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}c_{p,\\mathrm{CO_2}} + n_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}c_{p,\\mathrm{H_2O}} + n_{\\mathrm{N_2,total}}c_{p,\\mathrm{N_2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum n_j c_{p,j} = 2.1(44.0) + 4.2(42.0) + 20.7(34.0)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum n_j c_{p,j} = 92.4 + 176.4 + 703.8 = 972.6~\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\nNow we can compute the adiabatic flame temperature:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{ad}} = 298~\\mathrm{K} + \\frac{2147768~\\mathrm{J}}{972.6~\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}} = 298 + 2208.274...~\\mathrm{K}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{ad}} = 2506.274...~\\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures gives $2506~\\mathrm{K}$.",
