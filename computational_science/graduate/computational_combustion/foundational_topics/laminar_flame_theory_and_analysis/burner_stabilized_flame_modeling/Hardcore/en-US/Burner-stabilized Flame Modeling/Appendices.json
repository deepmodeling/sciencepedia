            "problem": "A one-dimensional, steady premixed flame can be modeled in two canonical configurations used in computational combustion: a burner-stabilized flame anchored on a solid burner and a freely propagating flame without a solid anchoring surface. Both are governed by conservation of mass, species, and energy for a reacting multicomponent mixture. Let $x$ denote the axial coordinate, $\\rho$ the density, $u$ the axial velocity, $Y_k$ the mass fraction of species $k$, $J_k$ the diffusive mass flux of species $k$, $\\dot{\\omega}_k$ the chemical production rate of species $k$, $T$ the temperature, $\\lambda$ the thermal conductivity, $h$ a heat transfer coefficient, $T_w$ a burner wall temperature, $T_u$ the unburned-gas temperature, and $S_L$ the laminar burning velocity.

Burner-stabilized flame: finite domain $x \\in [0,L]$ with a solid burner at $x=0$. Impose a thermal boundary at the burner by either a Dirichlet condition $T(0)=T_w$ or a Robin condition $-\\lambda \\, \\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_{x=0} = h \\, [\\,T(0)-T_w\\,]$. Impose zero normal species flux at the burner, $J_k(0)=0$ for all $k$. Specify the inflow by fixing the mass flux via $u(0)=u_{\\text{in}}$ so $m=\\rho u$ is determined by $d(\\rho u)/dx=0$. At the outflow $x=L$, apply open boundaries $\\frac{dT}{dx}(L)=0$ and $\\frac{dY_k}{dx}(L)=0$ so the solution exits smoothly. Stabilization criterion: the flame is stationary in the laboratory frame when the imposed convective inflow matches the mixture’s effective burning capability under the loss and strain environment, i.e., $u_{\\text{in}} = S_L^{\\text{eff}}$; if $u_{\\text{in}} < S_L^{\\text{eff}}$ the flame flashes back, whereas if $u_{\\text{in}} > S_L^{\\text{eff}}$ it blows off.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and presents a standard, non-trivial problem in computational combustion theory. The governing equations and physical scenarios described—the burner-stabilized flame and the freely propagating flame—are canonical models. The question assesses a clear and precise distinction between the mathematical formulations of these two problems, which is a fundamental concept in the field. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient to answer the question.\n\nThe core of the problem is to distinguish the mathematical setup for two fundamental one-dimensional ($1$D) premixed flame models.\n\n**1. Burner-Stabilized Flame**\n\nThis configuration models a flame that is held stationary in the laboratory frame by a solid object, typically a porous plug burner through which a premixed fuel-oxidizer mixture flows.\n\n*   **Governing Equations and Frame of Reference**: The problem is solved in a stationary (laboratory) frame of reference. The flame is located at a fixed position relative to the burner, which is placed at a boundary, say $x=0$. The governing equations for mass, species, and energy are solved on a finite domain, $x \\in [0, L]$.\n*   **Key Parameter**: The mass flow rate per unit area, $\\dot{m}'' = \\rho u$, is a constant throughout the domain since $d(\\rho u)/dx = 0$. In this configuration, $\\dot{m}''$ is a *prescribed input parameter*. The experimenter or computational scientist sets the inflow mass flux, which in turn fixes the inflow velocity for a given inlet density.\n*   **Boundary Conditions**:\n    *   At the inflow/burner surface ($x=0$): a) The velocity is determined by the prescribed mass flux, $\\dot{m}''$. b) A thermal boundary condition is required to account for heat transfer between the gas and the solid burner. This can be a Dirichlet condition, specifying the temperature $T(0)=T_w$, or more generally, a Robin condition that models heat loss, such as $-\\lambda \\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_{x=0} = h (T(0) - T_w)$. c) Species boundary conditions must be set. For a porous burner where a premixed gas flows in, the most direct physical condition is to specify the incoming mass fractions of the unburned mixture: $Y_k(0)=Y_{k, \\text{inlet}}$. An alternative simplification, sometimes used to model a non-catalytic surface while still allowing for convective flow-through, is to set the diffusive mass flux at the surface to zero, $J_k(0) = 0$ for all species $k$. Option A uses this latter simplification.\n    *   At the outflow ($x=L$): The computational domain must be long enough for the combustion to be complete (or nearly so). To prevent the boundary from artificially influencing the solution, \"open\" or \"soft\" boundary conditions are applied. These are typically zero-gradient (Neumann) conditions: $\\frac{dT}{dx}(L)=0$ and $\\frac{dY_k}{dx}(L)=0$.\n*   **Stabilization Criterion**: The problem is a boundary-value problem. For a given set of parameters (inflow mass flux $\\dot{m}''$, unburned mixture properties, burner thermal properties), one solves for the steady-state profiles $T(x)$ and $Y_k(x)$. A physically stable flame corresponds to the existence of a steady solution. The stabilization is physically understood as a balance between the imposed flow speed and the flame's tendency to propagate.\n\n**2. Freely Propagating Flame**\n\nThis configuration models an idealized, planar flame propagating freely into a quiescent, uniform unburned mixture, far from any walls or restraining surfaces.\n\n*   **Governing Equations and Frame of Reference**: The problem is most conveniently solved in a frame of reference moving with the flame front. In this frame, the flame is stationary, and the unburned gas flows towards it from $x \\to -\\infty$ at a speed $S_L$, the laminar burning velocity. The burned products flow away towards $x \\to +\\infty$. The domain is theoretically infinite, $x \\in (-\\infty, +\\infty)$.\n*   **Key Parameter**: The mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}'' = \\rho u$, is again constant. However, in this configuration, $\\dot{m}''$ is not a prescribed parameter. It is an *unknown eigenvalue* of the problem. The laminar burning velocity is then determined from this eigenvalue as $S_L = \\dot{m}''/\\rho_u$, where $\\rho_u$ is the density of the unburned gas.\n*   **Boundary Conditions**:\n    *   At the upstream far-field ($x \\to -\\infty$): The flow is the unburned mixture. Dirichlet conditions are applied: $T(-\\infty)=T_u$ and $Y_k(-\\infty)=Y_{k,u}$.\n    *   At the downstream far-field ($x \\to +\\infty$): The combustion is complete, and the gas is in chemical equilibrium. All gradients must vanish. Neumann conditions are applied: $\\frac{dT}{dx}(+\\infty)=0$ and $\\frac{dY_k}{dx}(+\\infty)=0$.\n*   **Propagation Criterion**: The system of governing ordinary differential equations, subject to the two-point boundary conditions at $\\pm\\infty$, constitutes a non-linear eigenvalue problem. A non-trivial solution (i.e., a flame profile) exists only for a unique, specific value of the mass flux $\\dot{m}''$. Finding this eigenvalue is the primary goal of the computation, as it determines the fundamental property of the mixture, the laminar burning velocity $S_L$.\n\nBased on this analysis, we evaluate the options.\n\n**Option A**\n*   **Burner-stabilized flame description**: Correctly identifies the finite domain $[0,L]$, standard thermal boundary conditions (Dirichlet or Robin), and zero-gradient outflow conditions. It correctly identifies the mass flux as a prescribed parameter and provides a reasonable (though simplified) species boundary condition ($J_k(0)=0$). The physical interpretation of stabilization is also correct.\n*   **Freely propagating flame description**: Correctly identifies the moving frame and infinite domain. It correctly specifies the upstream Dirichlet conditions and downstream zero-gradient conditions. Critically, it correctly identifies $S_L$ (via the mass flux $\\dot{m}''$) as an eigenvalue that emerges from satisfying the boundary conditions.\n*   **Verdict**: This option accurately and completely contrasts the two configurations. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B**\n*   This option incorrectly swaps the descriptions of the two flame types. It attributes a \"cold wall\" and a \"prescribed inlet\" to the freely propagating flame, which by definition has no walls. It attributes the \"moving frame with unknown $S_L$\" to the burner-stabilized flame, which is incorrect.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C**\n*   **Burner-stabilized flame description**: It incorrectly restricts the thermal condition to only the adiabatic case. Its stabilization criterion, $\\frac{dT}{dx}(0)=0$, is merely the adiabatic boundary condition itself, not a general criterion for stabilization.\n*   **Freely propagating flame description**: It incorrectly proposes imposing Dirichlet conditions for the burned state temperature $T_b$ and composition $Y_{k,b}$ downstream. This over-constrains the problem; the burned state is a result of the calculation, not an input. It also incorrectly states that $S_L$ is a known quantity.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D**\n*   **Freely propagating flame description**: As with option C, it incorrectly imposes Dirichlet conditions at the downstream boundary, which is a fundamental error. It also incorrectly implies that $S_L$ or $\\dot{m}''$ is a specified quantity.\n*   **Burner-stabilized flame description**: It incorrectly states that zero-gradient conditions are imposed at the burner; a non-adiabatic burner, which is the general case, has a non-zero temperature gradient. It also incorrectly claims the inflow $u(0)$ is unknown and adjusted; in the standard formulation, the inflow mass flux is a fixed input parameter.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that presents a physically and mathematically sound contrast between the two canonical flame models.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a canonical problem in combustion science—a one-dimensional burner-stabilized flame—and provides standard conservation equations and realistic physical parameters. The questions posed are precise and can be answered through a standard scaling analysis of the provided equations. The problem is valid.\n\nWe will proceed with the derivation as requested. The problem asks for scaling estimates for two characteristic lengths: the thermal boundary layer thickness, $\\delta_T$, and the reaction zone thickness, $\\delta_R$.\n\n**1. Scaling for the Thermal Boundary Layer Thickness ($\\delta_T$)**\n\nThe thermal boundary layer, or preheat zone, is the region near the burner where heat from the flame is conducted upstream, balancing the convective flow of the unburned mixture. In this region, chemical reactions are negligible. The steady-state energy conservation equation, neglecting the reaction term, is:\n$$ \\rho c_p u \\frac{dT}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(k\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) $$\nAssuming constant properties ($k$, $\\rho$, $c_p$), this simplifies to:\n$$ \\rho c_p u \\frac{dT}{dx} = k \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} $$\nTo find the characteristic thickness $\\delta_T$ of this layer, we perform a scaling analysis.

The derivatives are scaled as:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} \\sim \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T^2} $$\nwhere $\\Delta T$ is a characteristic temperature difference across the layer.\nSubstituting these scales into the energy equation gives the balance between the convective and conductive terms:\n$$ \\rho c_p u \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T} \\sim k \\frac{\\Delta T}{\\delta_T^2} $$\nSolving for $\\delta_T$, we get:\n$$ \\delta_T \\sim \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p u} $$\nThis can also be expressed using the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha = k/(\\rho c_p)$:\n$$ \\delta_T \\sim \\frac{\\alpha}{u} $$\n\n**2. Scaling for the Reaction Zone Thickness ($\\delta_R$)**\n\nThe reaction zone is a thin region within the flame where the fuel is consumed. The problem asks to determine its thickness, $\\delta_R$, by balancing molecular diffusion and chemical reaction. The governing equation for the mass fraction $Y$ of the deficient reactant is:\n$$ \\rho u \\frac{dY}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\rho D\\frac{dY}{dx}\\right) + \\omega $$\nThe reaction source term is given as $\\omega \\sim \\rho k_\\omega(T) Y$. In the thin reaction zone of a premixed flame (a concept formalized in large activation energy asymptotics), the diffusive flux is balanced by the consumption rate. Convection is typically a smaller effect within this layer. Following the problem's directive, we balance the diffusion and reaction terms.\nAssuming constant properties, the diffusion term is $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\rho D\\frac{dY}{dx}\\right) = \\rho D \\frac{d^2Y}{dx^2}$.\nLet the characteristic length be $x \\sim \\delta_R$ and the characteristic mass fraction be $Y \\sim Y_u$, where $Y_u$ is the unburned reactant mass fraction.

Interpretation and Option Analysis**\n\nThe thin-flame approximation (or flame-sheet model) is predicated on the assumption that the reaction zone is asymptotically thin compared to the preheat zone, i.e., $\\delta_R \\ll \\delta_T$. Our results show that in the high-temperature (near-adiabatic) case, $\\Xi_1 \\approx 0.45$, so the reaction zone is thinner than the preheat zone, and the approximation is reasonably valid.\n\nHowever, in the strong-heat-loss case, the flame temperature is reduced. Chemical reaction rates are highly sensitive to temperature (typically following an Arrhenius law, $k_\\omega \\propto \\exp(-E_a/RT)$). The significant reduction in $k_\\omega$ from $2.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ to $3.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ reflects this. As shown by the scaling $\\delta_R \\sim 1/\\sqrt{k_\\omega}$, a slower reaction leads to a thicker reaction zone. Our calculation shows $\\delta_R$ increases from $5.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ to $1.29 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nIn this strong-heat-loss case, the ratio becomes $\\Xi_2 \\approx 1.16$, which means $\\delta_R \\gtrsim \\delta_T$. The reaction zone is now as thick as, or even thicker than, the thermal boundary layer. When this occurs, the flame can no longer be idealized as a thin sheet. The reactions are distributed over a wide region, and the fundamental assumption of the thin-flame model breaks down. This phenomenon is characteristic of flames approaching their quenching limit due to excessive heat loss.\n\n- **A. The thin-flame approximation fails when $\\delta_R/\\delta_T \\gtrsim 1$, i.e., when the reaction zone thickness becomes comparable to or exceeds the thermal boundary layer thickness because heat loss reduces $k_\\omega(T)$ and broadens the reaction zone; in the strong-heat-loss case above, this condition is met.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the physics. The failure condition is correctly identified as $\\delta_R/\\delta_T \\gtrsim 1$. The causal chain—heat loss reduces temperature, which reduces $k_\\omega$, which broadens $\\delta_R$—is correct. The numerical results confirm that this condition is met in the strong-heat-loss case. This statement is **Correct**.\n\n- **B. The thin-flame approximation fails when $\\delta_R/\\delta_T \\ll 1$, because the flame is too sharp to resolve; the strong-heat-loss case above illustrates this situation.**\nThe condition $\\delta_R/\\delta_T \\ll 1$ is the requirement for the *validity* of the thin-flame approximation, not its failure. Furthermore, the strong-heat-loss case leads to $\\delta_R/\\delta_T \\approx 1.16$, which contradicts the condition $\\delta_R/\\delta_T \\ll 1$. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. If the Lewis number (ratio of thermal to mass diffusivity, $\\mathrm{Le}\\equiv \\alpha/D$ with $\\alpha=k/(\\rho c_p)$) is unity, the thin-flame approximation remains valid regardless of heat loss, so failure cannot be attributed to heat loss.**\nThe ratio of thicknesses is $\\Xi = \\delta_R / \\delta_T \\sim (\\sqrt{D/k_\\omega}) / (\\alpha/u)$. Substituting $\\alpha = D \\cdot \\text{Le}$ gives $\\Xi \\sim (u \\sqrt{D}) / (D \\cdot \\text{Le} \\sqrt{k_\\omega}) = u / (\\text{Le} \\sqrt{D k_\\omega})$. The ratio $\\Xi$ still depends on $k_\\omega$ as $1/\\sqrt{k_\\omega}$. Strong heat loss will decrease the flame temperature and thus $k_\\omega$, causing $\\Xi$ to increase. At a sufficiently small $k_\\omega$ (near quenching), $\\Xi$ will become large, and the thin-flame approximation will fail, regardless of the Lewis number. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Failure of the thin-flame approximation requires $T_w=T_u$; otherwise, heat loss cannot induce failure even if the reaction zone thickens.**\nThe condition $T_w \\approx T_u$ can lead to a nearly adiabatic flame if it's stabilized far from the burner, meaning there is minimal heat loss to the burner. This is the ideal case where the thin-flame approximation is *most* valid, as the flame temperature and reaction rate are maximized, making the reaction zone thinnest. Failure is induced by strong heat loss, which requires a significant temperature difference between the flame and the cooled wall ($T_w \\ll T_{flame}$). The problem setup with a cooled burner is designed to study the effects of heat loss, which causes the failure. This statement is the opposite of the correct physical reasoning. This statement is **Incorrect**.",

Do not invoke any shortcut formulas beyond these bases; instead, argue from timescale and balance considerations.\n\nGiven the following representative parameters for methane–air at atmospheric pressure: $\\alpha = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$, $S_L = 0.40\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $T_u = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $T_b = 2200\\ \\mathrm{K}$, and $E_a/R = 2.4\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{K}$, answer the following.\n\n1) Starting from advection–diffusion and diffusion–reaction timescale arguments, estimate the reaction-zone thickness $\\delta_R$ in terms of $\\delta_T$ and the Zel’dovich number $\\beta$, and compute a maximum grid spacing $\\Delta x_{\\max}$ that guarantees at least $N_R = 8$ points across $\\delta_R$.\n\n2) Propose a dimensionally consistent AMR indicator that will trigger refinement where the flame is under-resolved, based on simultaneous consideration of the normalized gradients of $T$ and $Y_F$ and a curvature-like measure built from $T$ in one dimension. The indicator should be scale-aware with respect to the local grid size $\\Delta x$ and the jump scales $T_b - T_u$ and $Y_{F,u}$, and it should support hysteresis to avoid grid thrashing.\n\nWhich option is most consistent with these principles and the provided data?\n\nA. Use the thermal thickness alone to set $\\Delta x_{\\max}$: take $\\Delta x_{\\max} = \\delta_T/10$. With the given data, this yields $\\Delta x_{\\max} \\approx 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$. For AMR, refine if $\\Delta x\\,|\\partial T/\\partial x|/(T_b - T_u) > 0.5$ and coarsen if it falls below $0.4$, with no species or curvature criteria.\n\nB. From reaction–diffusion balance, take $\\delta_R \\sim \\delta_T/\\beta$ and require $N_R$ points across $\\delta_R$, i.e., $\\Delta x_{\\max} = \\delta_R/N_R$. With the given data, compute $\\beta$ and obtain $\\Delta x_{\\max} \\approx 6.6\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$. For AMR, refine if \n$\\max\\!\\big(\\Delta x\\,|\\partial T/\\partial x|/(T_b - T_u),\\ \\Delta x\\,|\\partial Y_F/\\partial x|/Y_{F,u},\\ \\Delta x\\,\\kappa\\big) > 0.125$ \nand coarsen if all three fall below $0.06$, where in one dimension $\\kappa \\equiv \\big|\\partial^2 T/\\partial x^2\\big|/\\big|\\partial T/\\partial x\\big|$.\n\nC. Use a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) advection constraint with an explicit steady solver: take $\\Delta t = 1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}$ and set $\\Delta x_{\\max} = S_L\\,\\Delta t \\approx 4.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$. For AMR, refine if $|\\partial Y_F/\\partial x|\\,Y_{F,u}\\,\\Delta x > 0.1$ and ignore temperature and curvature.\n\nD. Account for kinetic-theory scales and require the grid to be below the mean free path; set $\\Delta x_{\\max} = 1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, and refine based on the curvature of the velocity field defined as $\\kappa_u \\equiv \\big|\\partial^2 u/\\partial x^2\\big|/\\big|\\partial u/\\partial x\\big|$, ignoring $T$ and $Y_F$ gradients because chemistry determines resolution.",

It directly addresses core challenges in computational combustion, namely resolving thin reaction zones.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles and data.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n#### Part 1: Estimation of Reaction Zone Thickness and Maximum Grid Spacing\n\nFirst, we calculate the Zel'dovich number, $\\beta$, which characterizes the temperature sensitivity of the reaction rate.\nThe definition is given as:\n$$ \\beta \\equiv \\frac{E_a (T_b - T_u)}{R T_b^2} $$\nUsing the provided data, $E_a/R = 2.4\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $T_u = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, and $T_b = 2200\\ \\mathrm{K}$:\n$$ \\beta = (2.4\\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\frac{(2200\\ \\mathrm{K} - 300\\ \\mathrm{K})}{(2200\\ \\mathrm{K})^2} = (2.4\\times 10^4) \\frac{1900}{4.84\\times 10^6} \\approx 9.42148 $$\n\nNext, we determine the characteristic thermal thickness of the flame, $\\delta_T$. This scale arises from the balance between advection and thermal diffusion in the preheat zone. The problem gives the scaling as $\\delta_T \\sim \\alpha/S_L$.\nUsing the data $\\alpha = 2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and $S_L = 0.40\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$:\n$$ \\delta_T \\sim \\frac{2.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}}{0.40\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 5.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\nThe problem states that the thin reaction zone thickness, $\\delta_R$, is set by a reaction–diffusion balance. In the limit of large activation energy (large $\\beta$), classical asymptotic analysis shows that the reaction is confined to a very thin layer near the hot boundary where the temperature is high. The width of this layer is smaller than the overall thermal thickness $\\delta_T$ by a factor of $\\beta$. This can be understood by considering that the temperature range over which the reaction rate changes significantly is of order $(T_b-T_u)/\\beta$. The temperature gradient in the flame is of order $(T_b-T_u)/\\delta_T$. Therefore, the spatial thickness of the reaction zone is the ratio of this temperature range to the characteristic gradient:\n$$ \\delta_R \\sim \\frac{(T_b-T_u)/\\beta}{(T_b-T_u)/\\delta_T} = \\frac{\\delta_T}{\\beta} $$\nUsing our calculated values for $\\delta_T$ and $\\beta$:\n$$ \\delta_R \\sim \\frac{5.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{9.42148} \\approx 5.307\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\nTo properly resolve this thin reaction zone, the grid spacing $\\Delta x$ must be a fraction of $\\delta_R$. The problem requires a minimum of $N_R = 8$ grid points across this zone. The maximum allowed grid spacing is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta x_{\\max} = \\frac{\\delta_R}{N_R} = \\frac{5.307\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{8} \\approx 6.634\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThis value is approximately $6.6\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\n#### Part 2: Formulation of the AMR Indicator\n\nAn effective AMR indicator for a flame should trigger refinement where solution features are sharpest and potentially under-resolved. The problem asks for an indicator based on normalized gradients of $T$ and $Y_F$, and a curvature measure for $T$.\n\n1.  **Normalized Gradients:** A good indicator of local resolution is the change in a variable across a single grid cell, normalized by the total change in that variable across the flame.\n    - For temperature: $I_T = \\frac{\\Delta x |\\partial T/\\partial x|}{T_b - T_u}$. This represents the fraction of the total temperature rise that occurs over one cell.\n    - For fuel mass fraction: $I_Y = \\frac{\\Delta x |\\partial Y_F/\\partial x|}{Y_{F,u}}$. (Assuming $Y_{F,b} \\approx 0$, the total change is $Y_{F,u}$).\n\n2.  **Curvature:** Gradients are largest in the center of the flame front, but refinement is also needed at the edges where gradients start to change rapidly. This is captured by a curvature-based term. A common 1D measure is the ratio of the second to the first derivative, which has units of inverse length. To make it a dimensionless indicator that is aware of the grid size, one multiplies by $\\Delta x$.\n    - Curvature indicator: $I_\\kappa = \\Delta x \\cdot \\kappa$, where the problem suggests using $\\kappa \\equiv |\\partial^2 T/\\partial x^2|/|\\partial T/\\partial x|$. So, $I_\\kappa = \\Delta x \\frac{|\\partial^2 T/\\partial x^2|}{|\\partial T/\\partial x|}$.\n\n3.  **Combined Criterion:** To ensure all sharp features are captured, the refinement should be triggered if any of these indicators exceeds a threshold.\n    - Refinement condition: $\\max(I_T, I_Y, I_\\kappa) > C_{\\text{refine}}$.\n    A logical choice for $C_{\\text{refine}}$ is $1/N$, where $N$ is the desired number of points across the feature. Since we want $N_R=8$ points in the reaction zone, a threshold of $C_{\\text{refine}} = 1/8 = 0.125$ is a well-justified choice.\n\n4.  **Hysteresis:** To avoid oscillations where cells are repeatedly refined and coarsened, the coarsening threshold $C_{\\text{coarsen}}$ should be lower than the refinement threshold.\n    - Coarsening condition: $\\max(I_T, I_Y, I_\\kappa) < C_{\\text{coarsen}}$. A value of $C_{\\text{coarsen}} \\approx C_{\\text{refine}}/2$ is a common heuristic.\n\nCombining these elements yields a comprehensive and principled AMR strategy.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A.** This option sets $\\Delta x_{\\max} = \\delta_T/10 \\approx 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$. This grid spacing is based on the thermal thickness, not the much thinner reaction thickness $\\delta_R \\approx 5.3\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$. A grid size nearly equal to the reaction zone thickness is grossly inadequate for resolving it, contradicting the goal of placing $N_R=8$ points. The AMR criterion is incomplete as it ignores species and curvature, and the refinement threshold of $0.5$ is too high, corresponding to only $2$ points of resolution. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B.** This option uses the scaling $\\delta_R \\sim \\delta_T/\\beta$ and requires $N_R$ points, leading to $\\Delta x_{\\max} = \\delta_R/N_R$. The computed value $\\Delta x_{\\max} \\approx 6.6\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$ matches our derivation precisely. The AMR criterion is $\\max\\!\\big(\\Delta x\\,|\\partial T/\\partial x|/(T_b - T_u),\\ \\Delta x\\,|\\partial Y_F/\\partial x|/Y_{F,u},\\ \\Delta x\\,\\kappa\\big) > 0.125$ for refinement, with $\\kappa$ defined as $|\\partial^2 T/\\partial x^2|/|\\partial T/\\partial x|$. This form matches our derived criterion in every aspect: the use of normalized gradients for both $T$ and $Y_F$, the inclusion of a dimensionless curvature term, the use of `max` for simultaneous consideration, and a refinement threshold of $0.125 = 1/8$ which is directly tied to the resolution requirement $N_R=8$. The coarsening threshold of $0.06$ is smaller than $0.125$, providing hysteresis. This option is fully consistent with the principles of flame theory and numerical resolution. **Correct**.\n\n**C.** This option determines $\\Delta x_{\\max}$ from a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition tied to an arbitrary time step for an explicit solver. This is fundamentally flawed. Grid resolution must be determined by the need to resolve physical length scales (accuracy), not by a numerical stability constraint of a time-marching method used to find a steady solution. The resulting grid spacing, $\\Delta x_{\\max} \\approx 4.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, is insufficient to resolve the reaction zone with $8$ points. The AMR criterion is incomplete (ignoring $T$ and curvature) and uses a non-standard, poorly motivated normalization $|\\partial Y_F/\\partial x|\\,Y_{F,u}\\,\\Delta x$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option proposes to resolve the mean free path of molecules, setting $\\Delta x_{\\max} = 1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$. This scale is relevant for kinetic theory simulations (like DSMC), not for continuum models described by the given advection-diffusion-reaction equations. For a flame at atmospheric pressure, the continuum hypothesis is valid, and resolving to this level is unnecessary and computationally wasteful. The AMR criterion is based on the curvature of the velocity field while ignoring direct markers of reaction ($T$ and $Y_F$ gradients). For strictly constant properties (including density), velocity is constant and its curvature is zero. For a more realistic gas, velocity is a proxy for temperature, so it is illogical to use it while ignoring temperature itself. **Incorrect**.",
