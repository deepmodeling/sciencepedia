            "solution": "The problem requires the definition of a conserved scalar based on elemental conservation and the calculation of the stoichiometric mixture fraction, $Z_{st}$. The process involves characterizing the fuel and oxidizer streams in terms of their elemental composition.\n\nFirst, we define a conserved scalar based on the elemental composition of the mixture. Let $b_k$ be the number of moles of element $k$ per unit mass of the mixture. Assuming equal a priori diffusivities for all elements, each $b_k$ is a conserved quantity. The elements present in this system are Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Nitrogen (N). The Bilger framework defines a conserved scalar, which we will denote as $\\beta$, as a linear combination of these elemental quantities. This scalar is constructed to be zero for the main products of complete combustion ($\\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, and inert $\\mathrm{N_2}$). The definition is based on the stoichiometric equation for hydrocarbon combustion, where carbon is oxidized to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ and hydrogen to $\\mathrm{H_2O}$.\n$\\mathrm{C} + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_2$ implies that $1$ mole of C requires $2$ moles of O atoms.\n$2\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$ implies that $2$ moles of H atoms require $1$ mole of O atoms, or $1$ mole of H atoms requires $0.5$ moles of O atoms.\nThus, the total moles of oxygen atoms required for complete combustion is $2 b_C + \\frac{1}{2} b_H$. The \"oxygen deficit\" is the amount of oxygen required minus the amount of oxygen present. We define the conserved scalar $\\beta$ as:\n$$ \\beta = 2 b_C + \\frac{1}{2} b_H - b_O $$\nThis quantity $\\beta$ is a conserved scalar because it is a linear combination of conserved scalars ($b_C$, $b_H$, $b_O$).\n\nTo find the stoichiometric mixture fraction $Z_{st}$, we first need to determine the value of $\\beta$ in the pure fuel stream ($\\beta_f$) and the pure oxidizer stream ($\\beta_{ox}$). The number of moles of element $k$ per unit mass of stream $s$ (where $s$ is either fuel, $f$, or oxidizer, $ox$), is given by:\n$$ b_{k,s} = \\frac{\\sum_i x_{s,i} n_{k,i}}{W_s} = \\frac{\\sum_i x_{s,i} n_{k,i}}{\\sum_j x_{s,j} W_j} $$\nwhere $x_{s,i}$ is the mole fraction of species $i$ in stream $s$, $n_{k,i}$ is the number of atoms of element $k$ in one molecule of species $i$, and $W_j$ is the molecular weight of species $j$.\n\nStep 1: Characterize the fuel stream.\nThe fuel stream composition is given as: $x_{f,\\mathrm{C_2H_6O}} = 0.80$, $x_{f,\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 0.10$, $x_{f,\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.05$, and $x_{f,\\mathrm{N_2}} = 0.05$.\nThe molecular weights are: $W_{\\mathrm{C_2H_6O}} = 46.06844\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,kmol^{-1}}$, $W_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 44.0095\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,kmol^{-1}}$, $W_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 18.01528\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,kmol^{-1}}$, and $W_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 28.0134\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,kmol^{-1}}$.\nThe average molecular weight of the fuel stream, $W_f$, is:\n$$ W_f = \\sum_i x_{f,i} W_i = (0.80)(46.06844) + (0.10)(44.0095) + (0.05)(18.01528) + (0.05)(28.0134) $$\n$$ W_f = 36.854752 + 4.40095 + 0.900764 + 1.40067 = 43.557136\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,kmol^{-1}} $$\nThe number of moles of each element per mole of fuel mixture is:\nMoles of C: $n_{C,f} = 0.80 \\times 2 + 0.10 \\times 1 = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,C\\,/\\,kmol\\,fuel}$\nMoles of H: $n_{H,f} = 0.80 \\times 6 + 0.05 \\times 2 = 4.9\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,H\\,/\\,kmol\\,fuel}$\nMoles of O: $n_{O,f} = 0.80 \\times 1 + 0.10 \\times 2 + 0.05 \\times 1 = 1.05\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,O\\,/\\,kmol\\,fuel}$\nNow, we calculate $\\beta_f$:\n$$ \\beta_f = 2 b_{C,f} + \\frac{1}{2} b_{H,f} - b_{O,f} = \\frac{2 n_{C,f} + \\frac{1}{2} n_{H,f} - n_{O,f}}{W_f} $$\n$$ \\beta_f = \\frac{2(1.7) + \\frac{1}{2}(4.9) - 1.05}{43.557136} = \\frac{3.4 + 2.45 - 1.05}{43.557136} = \\frac{4.8}{43.557136}\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,kg^{-1}} $$\n\nStep 2: Characterize the oxidizer stream.\nThe oxidizer stream composition is: $x_{ox,\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.209$, $x_{ox,\\mathrm{N_2}} = 0.781$, and $x_{ox,\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.010$.\nThe molecular weights are: $W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 31.9988\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,kmol^{-1}}$, $W_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 28.0134\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,kmol^{-1}}$, and $W_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 18.01528\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,kmol^{-1}}$.\nThe average molecular weight of the oxidizer stream, $W_{ox}$, is:\n$$ W_{ox} = \\sum_i x_{ox,i} W_i = (0.209)(31.9988) + (0.781)(28.0134) + (0.010)(18.01528) $$\n$$ W_{ox} = 6.6877492 + 21.8784654 + 0.1801528 = 28.7463674\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,kmol^{-1}} $$\nThe number of moles of each element per mole of oxidizer mixture is:\nMoles of C: $n_{C,ox} = 0\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,C\\,/\\,kmol\\,ox}$\nMoles of H: $n_{H,ox} = 0.010 \\times 2 = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,H\\,/\\,kmol\\,ox}$\nMoles of O: $n_{O,ox} = 0.209 \\times 2 + 0.010 \\times 1 = 0.428\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,O\\,/\\,kmol\\,ox}$\nNow, we calculate $\\beta_{ox}$:\n$$ \\beta_{ox} = \\frac{2 n_{C,ox} + \\frac{1}{2} n_{H,ox} - n_{O,ox}}{W_{ox}} $$\n$$ \\beta_{ox} = \\frac{2(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(0.02) - 0.428}{28.7463674} = \\frac{0.01 - 0.428}{28.7463674} = \\frac{-0.418}{28.7463674}\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,kg^{-1}} $$\n\nStep 3: Define and calculate the stoichiometric mixture fraction $Z_{st}$.\nThe mixture fraction $Z$ is a conserved scalar defined to be $1$ in the fuel stream and $0$ in the oxidizer stream. It can be constructed from any other conserved scalar, such as $\\beta$:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\beta - \\beta_{ox}}{\\beta_f - \\beta_{ox}} $$\nA stoichiometric mixture is one that contains exactly enough oxygen to completely oxidize all combustible elements (C and H) to $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ and $\\mathrm{H_2O}$. For such a mixture, the value of $\\beta$ is zero by construction. The stoichiometric mixture fraction $Z_{st}$ is the value of $Z$ for this mixture. Setting $\\beta = 0$:\n$$ Z_{st} = \\frac{0 - \\beta_{ox}}{\\beta_f - \\beta_{ox}} = \\frac{-\\beta_{ox}}{\\beta_f - \\beta_{ox}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\beta_f$ and $\\beta_{ox}$:\n$$ Z_{st} = \\frac{-\\left(\\frac{-0.418}{28.7463674}\\right)}{\\frac{4.8}{43.557136} - \\left(\\frac{-0.418}{28.7463674}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{0.418}{28.7463674}}{\\frac{4.8}{43.557136} + \\frac{0.418}{28.7463674}} $$\nNumerically, we have:\n$\\beta_f \\approx 0.11020030\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,kg^{-1}}$\n$\\beta_{ox} \\approx -0.01454100\\,\\mathrm{kmol\\,kg^{-1}}$\n$$ Z_{st} = \\frac{0.01454100}{0.11020030 + 0.01454100} = \\frac{0.01454100}{0.12474130} \\approx 0.11656934 $$\nRounding to five significant figures, $Z_{st} \\approx 0.11657$.\n\nStep 4: Verification of the conserved scalar.\nThe problem asks to verify that for a stoichiometric mixture, the conserved scalar $\\beta$ remains zero for any equilibrium product composition.\nA fluid parcel is defined as stoichiometric if its elemental composition is such that $\\beta = 2 b_C + \\frac{1}{2} b_H - b_O = 0$. Because the elemental moles per unit mass ($b_k$) are conserved quantities (assuming equal elemental diffusivities), their specific linear combination $\\beta$ is also a conserved quantity for that fluid parcel. This means the value of $\\beta$ for a given fluid parcel does not change as it undergoes chemical reactions.\nTherefore, if a fluid parcel starts with a stoichiometric composition ($\\beta = 0$), it will maintain $\\beta = 0$ throughout its history, regardless of whether it is unburnt, partially burnt, or at chemical equilibrium. The specific species that constitute the mixture at equilibrium (e.g., $\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\mathrm{H_2O}, \\mathrm{N_2}, \\mathrm{CO}, \\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{H_2}$, etc.) must collectively respect the overall elemental balance of the parcel. Since the elemental balance corresponds to $\\beta = 0$, the state of the mixture, including any equilibrium state, must also have $\\beta = 0$. This principle is the foundation of using the mixture fraction approach in combustion modeling.\n\nThe calculation of $Z_{st}$ depends only on the elemental compositions of the unmixed streams and the definition of stoichiometry, which sets $\\beta=0$. The value is thus fixed.\nFinal value is $Z_{st} \\approx 0.11657$.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of reacting flow transport phenomena, is mathematically well-posed, internally consistent, and objective. We proceed with a step-by-step solution.\n\n#### Part 1: Conceptual Analysis of Scalar Transport\n\nThe transport of a generic scalar $\\psi$ in the specified flow is governed by the steady advection–diffusion–reaction equation:\n$$\nU \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\psi}{\\partial x^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\psi}{\\partial y^{2}} \\right) + S_{\\psi}\n$$\n\nThe mixture fraction, $Z$, is constructed from elemental mass fractions. According to the principle of conservation of elements, atoms are neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions. Therefore, the elemental mass fractions are conserved quantities. The Bilger mixture fraction $Z$, being a normalized linear combination of these elemental mass fractions, is also a conserved quantity, provided there is no differential diffusion. The problem states that all Lewis numbers are unity, which implies that the mass diffusivity $D_{i}$ of each species $i$ is equal to the thermal diffusivity of the mixture. With the further assumption of a constant mixture-averaged diffusivity $D$, this effectively eliminates differential diffusion effects. Consequently, the source term for the mixture fraction is identically zero, $S_{Z} = 0$.\n\nThe progress variable, $\\phi$, is defined as a linear combination of the mass fractions of product species, such as $\\text{CO}_2$ and $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$. These species are produced or consumed during the chemical reaction process. The source term $S_{\\phi}$ represents the net rate of change of $\\phi$ due to chemical reactions. In a reacting flow, this rate is generally non-zero, so $S_{\\phi} \\neq 0$.\n\nContours of constant $\\phi$ coincide with contours of constant $Z$ if and only if their gradient vectors, $\\nabla \\phi$ and $\\nabla Z$, are parallel throughout the domain. This condition implies that $\\phi$ must be a function of $Z$ alone, i.e., $\\phi = f(Z)$. If this is true, the chain rule gives $\\nabla \\phi = \\frac{d f}{d Z} \\nabla Z$.\n\nLet's examine the transport equations under this condition. The transport equation for $Z$ is:\n$$\nU \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x} = D \\nabla^{2} Z\n$$\nIf $\\phi = f(Z)$, its derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = f'(Z) \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x}$ and $\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\nabla \\cdot (f'(Z) \\nabla Z) = f'(Z) \\nabla^2 Z + f''(Z) |\\nabla Z|^2$. Substituting these into the transport equation for $\\phi$:\n$$\nU f'(Z) \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x} = D \\left(f'(Z) \\nabla^2 Z + f''(Z) |\\nabla Z|^2 \\right) + S_{\\phi}\n$$\nUsing the transport equation for $Z$ to substitute $U \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x}$:\n$$\nf'(Z) (D \\nabla^2 Z) = D f'(Z) \\nabla^2 Z + D f''(Z) |\\nabla Z|^2 + S_{\\phi}\n$$\nThis simplifies to $0 = D f''(Z) |\\nabla Z|^2 + S_{\\phi}$, or $S_{\\phi} = -D f''(Z) |\\nabla Z|^2$. This is the flamelet equation, which describes a specific relationship between the source term and the scalar dissipation rate.\nHowever, the question asks for a special condition under which the contours coincide. The most direct and simple condition for this is when the source term for the progress variable is identically zero, $S_{\\phi} = 0$. If $S_{\\phi}=0$, the transport equation for $\\phi$ becomes $U \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = D \\nabla^{2} \\phi$, which is of the same form as the equation for $Z$. If $\\phi$ and $Z$ are subject to boundary conditions that are linearly related, then $\\phi$ and $Z$ will be linearly related throughout the domain, i.e., $\\phi = c_1 Z + c_2$ for some constants $c_1, c_2$. In this case, $\\nabla \\phi = c_1 \\nabla Z$, their gradients are parallel, and their level sets (contours) coincide. Therefore, the special condition is $S_{\\phi} = 0$.\n\n#### Part 2: Algebraic Conditions and Coefficient Determination\n\nWe are given the transport equation $U \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x} = D \\nabla^2 \\psi + S_\\psi$.\n\nFirst, for the mixture fraction $Z(x,y) = B \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\cos(k y)$, the source term is $S_Z = 0$. We compute the derivatives:\n$\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x} = -\\lambda B \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\cos(k y) = -\\lambda Z$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 Z}{\\partial x^2} = \\lambda^2 B \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\cos(k y) = \\lambda^2 Z$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 Z}{\\partial y^2} = -k^2 B \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\cos(k y) = -k^2 Z$\nSubstituting into the transport equation:\n$U(-\\lambda Z) = D(\\lambda^2 Z - k^2 Z)$\nFor this to hold for $Z \\neq 0$, we divide by $Z$ to get the algebraic condition on $\\lambda$:\n$-U\\lambda = D(\\lambda^2 - k^2) \\implies D\\lambda^2 + U\\lambda - Dk^2 = 0$.\nSince $\\lambda > 0$ is required, the physically meaningful solution for $\\lambda$ is $\\lambda = \\frac{-U + \\sqrt{U^2 + 4D^2k^2}}{2D}$.\n\nNext, for the progress variable $\\phi(x,y) = A \\exp(-\\mu x) \\sin(k y)$ with source term $S_{\\phi}(x,y) = s_{0} \\exp(-\\beta x) \\sin(k y)$, we compute the derivatives of $\\phi$:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} = -\\mu A \\exp(-\\mu x) \\sin(k y) = -\\mu \\phi$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\mu^2 A \\exp(-\\mu x) \\sin(k y) = \\mu^2 \\phi$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = -k^2 A \\exp(-\\mu x) \\sin(k y) = -k^2 \\phi$\nSubstituting into the transport equation for $\\phi$:\n$U(-\\mu \\phi) = D(\\mu^2 \\phi - k^2 \\phi) + S_\\phi$\nReplacing $\\phi$ and $S_\\phi$ with their full expressions:\n$U(-\\mu A \\exp(-\\mu x) \\sin(k y)) = D(\\mu^2 - k^2)A \\exp(-\\mu x) \\sin(k y) + s_{0} \\exp(-\\beta x) \\sin(k y)$\nFor this equation to be valid for all $x$ and $y$, the spatial dependencies must match. The $\\sin(ky)$ term is common. The exponential terms $\\exp(-\\mu x)$ and $\\exp(-\\beta x)$ require that $\\mu = \\beta$. This is the condition on $\\mu$.\nWith $\\mu = \\beta$, we can divide the equation by $\\exp(-\\mu x) \\sin(k y)$:\n$-U\\mu A = D(\\mu^2 - k^2)A + s_0$\nRearranging to solve for $A$:\n$s_0 = -U\\mu A - D(\\mu^2 - k^2)A = -A(U\\mu + D(\\mu^2 - k^2))$\nThus, the expression for $A$ is:\n$A = -\\frac{s_0}{U\\mu + D(\\mu^2 - k^2)}$\n\n#### Part 3: Misalignment Angle Derivation\n\nThe misalignment angle $\\theta(x,y)$ is defined by $\\cos \\theta(x,y) = \\frac{\\nabla Z \\cdot \\nabla \\phi}{|\\nabla Z| |\\nabla \\phi|}$. We first compute the gradients $\\nabla Z$ and $\\nabla \\phi$.\nFor $Z(x,y) = B \\exp(-\\lambda x) \\cos(k y)$:\n$\\nabla Z = \\left( \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\left( -\\lambda B e^{-\\lambda x} \\cos(ky), -k B e^{-\\lambda x} \\sin(ky) \\right) = B e^{-\\lambda x} \\left( -\\lambda \\cos(ky), -k \\sin(ky) \\right)$\nFor $\\phi(x,y) = A \\exp(-\\mu x) \\sin(k y)$:\n$\\nabla \\phi = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\left( -\\mu A e^{-\\mu x} \\sin(ky), k A e^{-\\mu x} \\cos(ky) \\right) = A e^{-\\mu x} \\left( -\\mu \\sin(ky), k \\cos(ky) \\right)$\n\nThe dot product is:\n$\\nabla Z \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = (B e^{-\\lambda x})(-\\lambda \\cos(ky)) (A e^{-\\mu x})(-\\mu \\sin(ky)) + (B e^{-\\lambda x})(-k \\sin(ky)) (A e^{-\\mu x})(k \\cos(ky))$\n$= AB e^{-(\\lambda+\\mu)x} \\left( \\lambda\\mu \\cos(ky)\\sin(ky) - k^2 \\sin(ky)\\cos(ky) \\right)$\n$= AB e^{-(\\lambda+\\mu)x} (\\lambda\\mu - k^2) \\sin(ky)\\cos(ky)$\n\nThe squared magnitudes of the gradients are:\n$|\\nabla Z|^2 = (B e^{-\\lambda x})^2 \\left( (-\\lambda \\cos(ky))^2 + (-k \\sin(ky))^2 \\right) = B^2 e^{-2\\lambda x} (\\lambda^2 \\cos^2(ky) + k^2 \\sin^2(ky))$\n$|\\nabla \\phi|^2 = (A e^{-\\mu x})^2 \\left( (-\\mu \\sin(ky))^2 + (k \\cos(ky))^2 \\right) = A^2 e^{-2\\mu x} (\\mu^2 \\sin^2(ky) + k^2 \\cos^2(ky))$\n\nThe product of a non-zero $A$ and $B$ can be positive or negative. We define $\\theta$ as the angle in $[0, \\pi]$, so $\\cos\\theta$ can be negative. We may write $|A||B|\\text{sgn}(AB)$ to be precise, but standard vector algebra implies $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}}{|\\mathbf{u}||\\mathbf{v}|}$. Here, we have $AB$ in the numerator and $|A||B|$ in the denominator. So the sign is $\\text{sgn}(AB)$. Let us assume $A,B > 0$ for simplicity, as their product's sign only reflects a choice of direction for the gradients. The resulting angle's physical meaning is the same.\n$\\cos \\theta(x,y) = \\frac{e^{-(\\lambda+\\mu)x} (\\lambda\\mu - k^2) \\sin(ky)\\cos(ky)}{e^{-(\\lambda+\\mu)x} \\sqrt{\\lambda^2 \\cos^2(ky) + k^2 \\sin^2(ky)} \\sqrt{\\mu^2 \\sin^2(ky) + k^2 \\cos^2(ky)}}$\nThe expression for $\\cos \\theta$ is independent of $x$.\nAt $y = \\frac{\\pi}{4k}$, we have $ky = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.

For $C$ to be a valid coordinate in a flamelet model, it should be a monotonic function of the reaction's progression.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the field of computational combustion. All necessary information is provided, and there are no internal contradictions. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nFirst, we address the justification for requiring the progress variable $C(Z)$ to be monotonically non-decreasing with respect to the conserved scalar $Z$. A conserved scalar, such as the mixture fraction $Z$, parameterizes the thermochemical state space along a one-dimensional path. In the context of a premixed flame, $Z$ can be interpreted as a coordinate that tracks the progression from the unburnt state (conventionally $Z=0$) to the burnt state (conventionally $Z=1$). A progress variable, $C$, is designed to quantify the extent of chemical reaction. The fundamental purpose of using a coordinate system like $(Z, C)$ to describe the flame is to establish a unique mapping from these coordinates to the full thermochemical state of the system (e.g., temperature and species mass fractions). If $C(Z)$ were not monotonic, a single value of $C$ could correspond to multiple values of $Z$. This would introduce ambiguity, defeating the purpose of $C$ as a variable that measures unique \"progress\" along the flame structure. For any given mixture (fixed $Z$), as the reaction proceeds, $C$ should increase. As we move along the flamelet solution from reactants to products (increasing $Z$), we expect the overall extent of reaction to continually advance or at least not regress. Therefore, for $C$ to be a valid and unambiguous measure of reaction progress along the coordinate $Z$, it must be a monotonically non-decreasing function of $Z$. Mathematically, this is expressed as the condition $\\frac{dC}{dZ} \\ge 0$ for all $Z$ in the domain of interest, here $Z \\in [0,1]$.\n\nNext, we demonstrate that the choice of weights $w = (1,0,0)$ results in a non-monotonic progress variable.\nFor this choice, the progress variable $C(Z)$ is given by:\n$$\nC(Z) = (1) Y_{1}(Z) + (0) Y_{2}(Z) + (0) Y_{3}(Z) = Y_{1}(Z)\n$$\nUsing the provided functional form for $Y_{1}(Z)$:\n$$\nC(Z) = Z(1-Z) = Z - Z^{2}\n$$\nTo assess monotonicity, we compute the derivative with respect to $Z$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dZ} = \\frac{d}{dZ} (Z - Z^{2}) = 1 - 2Z\n$$\nWe seek the interval of $Z \\in [0,1]$ over which this derivative is negative, signifying a decrease in $C(Z)$ as $Z$ increases.\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dZ} < 0 \\implies 1 - 2Z < 0 \\implies 1 < 2Z \\implies Z > \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThus, for $Z \\in (\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$, the derivative $\\frac{dC}{dZ}$ is negative. This explicitly demonstrates that $C(Z)$ defined with $w = (1,0,0)$ is not monotonically non-decreasing over the entire interval $[0,1]$.\n\nFinally, we formulate and solve the constrained optimization problem to find the optimal weights $w^{\\star} = (w_{1}^{\\star}, w_{2}^{\\star}, w_{3}^{\\star})$ that enforce monotonicity with the largest possible non-negativity margin.\nThe progress variable is defined as:\n$$\nC(Z) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_{i} Y_{i}(Z)\n$$\nIts derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dZ} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_{i} \\frac{dY_{i}}{dZ}\n$$\nWe compute the derivatives of the given species profiles:\n$$\n\\frac{dY_{1}}{dZ} = \\frac{d}{dZ}(Z-Z^{2}) = 1 - 2Z\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dY_{2}}{dZ} = \\frac{d}{dZ}(Z - \\frac{Z^{2}}{2}) = 1 - Z\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dY_{3}}{dZ} = \\frac{d}{dZ}(\\frac{Z}{2} - \\frac{Z^{2}}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} - Z\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\frac{dC}{dZ}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dZ} = w_{1}(1 - 2Z) + w_{2}(1 - Z) + w_{3}(\\frac{1}{2} - Z)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged as a linear function of $Z$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dZ} = (w_{1} + w_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}w_{3}) - (2w_{1} + w_{2} + w_{3})Z\n$$\nThe optimization problem is to maximize a scalar $m$ subject to $\\frac{dC}{dZ} \\ge m$ for all $Z \\in [0,1]$, and the constraints on the weights: $w_{i} \\ge 0$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_{i} = 1$.\n\nThe condition $\\frac{dC}{dZ} \\ge m$ must hold for the minimum value of $\\frac{dC}{dZ}$ on the interval $Z \\in [0,1]$. Since $\\frac{dC}{dZ}$ is a linear function of $Z$, its minimum on a closed interval will occur at one of the endpoints, $Z=0$ or $Z=1$.\nAt $Z=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dZ}\\bigg|_{Z=0} = w_{1} + w_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}w_{3}\n$$\nAt $Z=1$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dZ}\\bigg|_{Z=1} = (w_{1} + w_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}w_{3}) - (2w_{1} + w_{2} + w_{3}) = -w_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}w_{3}\n$$\nThe optimization problem can now be stated as:\nMaximize $m$ subject to:\n1. $w_{1} + w_{2} + \\frac{1}{2}w_{3} \\ge m$\n2. $-w_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}w_{3} \\ge m$\n3. $w_{1} + w_{2} + w_{3} = 1$\n4. $w_{1} \\ge 0, w_{2} \\ge 0, w_{3} \\ge 0$\n\nFrom constraint $2$, we have $m \\le -w_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}w_{3}$. Since $w_{1}$ and $w_{3}$ are non-negative (constraint $4$), the term $-w_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}w_{3}$ is always less than or equal to zero.\n$$\n-w_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}w_{3} \\le 0\n$$\nThis implies that $m \\le 0$. The maximum possible value for the margin $m$ is $0$. To maximize $m$, we must make the right-hand side of $m \\le -w_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}w_{3}$ as large as possible, which means we must set it to its maximum value of $0$.\nThis maximum is achieved when $-w_{1} - \\frac{1}{2}w_{3} = 0$. Given that $w_{1} \\ge 0$ and $w_{3} \\ge 0$, this equality can only be satisfied if $w_{1} = 0$ and $w_{3} = 0$.\n\nHaving determined the optimal values for $w_{1}$ and $w_{3}$, we use the normalization constraint (constraint $3$) to find $w_{2}$:\n$$\nw_{1} + w_{2} + w_{3} = 1 \\implies 0 + w_{2} + 0 = 1 \\implies w_{2} = 1\n$$\nThis gives the unique optimal weight vector $w^{\\star} = (0, 1, 0)$.\nLet's verify this solution. The weights $w_{1}=0$, $w_{2}=1$, $w_{3}=0$ satisfy all constraints. The value of $m$ is maximized at $m=0$.\nWith $w^{\\star} = (0, 1, 0)$, the derivative becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dZ} = (1)(1-Z) = 1-Z\n$$\nFor $Z \\in [0,1]$, we have $1-Z \\ge 0$, so the monotonicity condition $\\frac{dC}{dZ} \\ge 0$ is satisfied. The minimum value of the derivative is $\\min_{Z \\in [0,1]} (1-Z) = 0$ (at $Z=1$), which corresponds to the maximized margin $m=0$.\nThe optimal weight vector is therefore $w^{\\star} = (0, 1, 0)$.",
