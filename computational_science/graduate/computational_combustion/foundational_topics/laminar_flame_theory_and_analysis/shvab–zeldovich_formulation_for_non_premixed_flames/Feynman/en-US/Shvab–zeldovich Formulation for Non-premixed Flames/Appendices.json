The mixture fraction, $Z$, is a conserved scalar by definition, with values $Z=1$ in the fuel stream and $Z=0$ in the oxidizer stream. The scalar $\\beta$, being a linear combination of conserved elemental mass fractions, is also a conserved scalar.\n\nTherefore, $\\beta$ must be a linear function of $Z$:\n$$ \\beta(Z) = (\\beta_F - \\beta_O)Z + \\beta_O $$\nwhere $\\beta_F$ and $\\beta_O$ are the values of $\\beta$ in the pure fuel and oxidizer streams, respectively.\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\beta_F$ for the fuel stream ($Z=1$), where $Y_{C,F} = \\frac{12}{16}$, $Y_{H,F} = \\frac{4}{16}$, and $Y_{O,F} = 0$.\n$$ \\beta_F = 2\\,\\frac{Y_{C,F}}{W_C} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{Y_{H,F}}{W_H} - \\frac{Y_{O,F}}{W_O} $$\n$$ \\beta_F = 2 \\left( \\frac{12/16}{12} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4/16}{1} \\right) - \\frac{0}{16} $$\n$$ \\beta_F = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{16} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4}{16} \\right) = \\frac{2}{16} + \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n\nNext, we calculate $\\beta_O$ for the oxidizer stream ($Z=0$), where $Y_{C,O} = 0$, $Y_{H,O} = 0$, and $Y_{O,O} = 0.233$.\n$$ \\beta_O = 2\\,\\frac{Y_{C,O}}{W_C} + \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\frac{Y_{H,O}}{W_H} - \\frac{Y_{O,O}}{W_O} $$\n$$ \\beta_O = 2 \\left( \\frac{0}{12} \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{0}{1} \\right) - \\frac{0.233}{16} $$\n$$ \\beta_O = - \\frac{0.233}{16} $$\n\nStoichiometry is defined as the condition where there is exactly enough oxidizer to completely consume the fuel, which corresponds to $\\beta = 0$. We denote the mixture fraction at this condition as $Z_{st}$. We can find $Z_{st}$ by setting $\\beta(Z_{st}) = 0$ in the linear relationship.\n$$ 0 = (\\beta_F - \\beta_O)Z_{st} + \\beta_O $$\nSolving for $Z_{st}$:\n$$ Z_{st} = \\frac{-\\beta_O}{\\beta_F - \\beta_O} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $\\beta_F$ and $\\beta_O$:\n$$ Z_{st} = \\frac{- \\left( - \\frac{0.233}{16} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{4} - \\left( - \\frac{0.233}{16} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{0.233}{16}}{\\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{0.233}{16}} $$\n$$ Z_{st} = \\frac{\\frac{0.233}{16}}{\\frac{4 + 0.233}{16}} = \\frac{0.233}{4.233} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ Z_{st} \\approx 0.0550437042... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives:\n$$ Z_{st} \\approx 0.05504 $$\n\nThe problem then asks to determine if the state at a location with mixture fraction $Z = 0.08$ is fuel-lean or fuel-rich.\nA mixture is:\n-   Fuel-lean if $Z  Z_{st}$ (excess oxidizer)\n-   Fuel-rich if $Z > Z_{st}$ (excess fuel)\n-   Stoichiometric if $Z = Z_{st}$\n\nComparing the given value $Z=0.08$ with the calculated stoichiometric value $Z_{st} \\approx 0.05504$:\n$$ 0.08 > 0.05504 $$\nSince $Z > Z_{st}$, the mixture is fuel-rich.\n\nWe must also calculate $s = \\operatorname{sgn}(Z - Z_{st})$.\n$$ Z - Z_{st} = 0.08 - 0.05504 = 0.02496 $$\nSince $Z - Z_{st} > 0$, the sign function gives:\n$$ s = \\operatorname{sgn}(0.02496) = 1 $$\n\nThe final answer is to be provided as a two-entry row matrix $$ \\begin{pmatrix} Z_{st}  s \\end{pmatrix} $$.\nThe two entries are $Z_{st} = 0.05504$ and $s = 1$.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a standard problem in combustion theory that requires the application of principles from thermodynamics and stoichiometry. All necessary data are provided, and the task is clearly defined. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe stoichiometric mixture fraction, $Z_{st}$, represents the specific value of the mixture fraction $Z$ at which fuel and oxidizer are mixed in exact stoichiometric proportions, leading to complete combustion with no excess of either reactant. The mixture fraction $Z$ is defined as the mass fraction of material in a given fluid parcel that originated from the fuel stream. Consequently, $(1-Z)$ is the mass fraction of material that originated from the oxidizer stream.\n\nLet $m_F$ be the mass originating from the fuel stream and $m_O$ be the mass originating from the oxidizer stream in a mixture of total mass $m_{total} = m_F + m_O$. The mixture fraction is $Z = m_F / m_{total}$.\nLet $Y_{F,fuel}$ be the mass fraction of fuel in the fuel stream and $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}}$ be the mass fraction of oxygen in the oxidizer stream.\nThe mass of fuel available in the mixture is $m_f = Y_{F,fuel} m_F = Y_{F,fuel} Z m_{total}$.\nThe mass of oxygen available in the mixture is $m_{O_2} = Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}} m_O = Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}} (1-Z) m_{total}$.\n\nStoichiometry is defined by the stoichiometric oxygen-to-fuel mass ratio, $L_s$, which is the mass of oxygen required to completely burn a unit mass of fuel. At the flame location, where $Z = Z_{st}$, the available mass of oxygen is exactly $L_s$ times the available mass of fuel:\n$$m_{O_2} = L_s \\cdot m_f$$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of $Z$ and cancelling $m_{total}$:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}} (1-Z_{st}) = L_s \\cdot Y_{F,fuel} Z_{st}$$\nThis equation is solved for $Z_{st}$:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}} - Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}} Z_{st} = L_s Y_{F,fuel} Z_{st}$$\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}} = (L_s Y_{F,fuel} + Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}}) Z_{st}$$\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}}}{L_s Y_{F,fuel} + Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{L_s Y_{F,fuel}}{Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}}}}$$\nIn this specific problem, the fuel stream is pure methane ($\\mathrm{CH_4}$), so the mass fraction of fuel in the fuel stream is $Y_{F,fuel} = 1$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$Z_{st} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{L_s}{Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}}}}$$\nThis is the general expression for $Z_{st}$ for a pure fuel stream. Now, we must compute the values of $L_s$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the stoichiometric oxygen-to-fuel mass ratio, $L_s$, for methane. The complete oxidation reaction is:\n$$\\mathrm{CH_4} + 2\\,\\mathrm{O_2} \\to \\mathrm{CO_2} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H_2O}$$\nThis indicates that $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ reacts with $2$ moles of $\\mathrm{O_2}$.

The oxidizer is humid air with a relative humidity $\\phi=0.60$ at $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $P=101325\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. The saturation pressure of water at this temperature is $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}=3168\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\nThe partial pressure of water vapor, $p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$, is given by the definition of relative humidity:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = \\phi \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 0.60 \\times 3168\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 1900.8\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nBy Dalton's law, the mole fraction of water vapor, $y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$, in the oxidizer stream is:\n$$y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{P} = \\frac{1900.8}{101325} \\approx 0.018759$$\nThe remainder of the mixture is dry air, so its mole fraction is $y_{\\mathrm{dry\\,air}} = 1 - y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$. The mole fractions of oxygen ($y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$) and nitrogen ($y_{\\mathrm{N_2}}$) in the humid air are found by scaling their mole fractions in dry air ($y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\mathrm{dry}}=0.21$, $y_{\\mathrm{N_2}}^{\\mathrm{dry}}=0.79$):\n$$y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\mathrm{dry}} (1 - y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}) = 0.21 \\left(1 - \\frac{1900.8}{101325}\\right) = 0.21 \\left(\\frac{99424.2}{101325}\\right) = \\frac{20879.082}{101325} \\approx 0.20606$$\n$$y_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{N_2}}^{\\mathrm{dry}} (1 - y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}) = 0.79 \\left(1 - \\frac{1900.8}{101325}\\right) = 0.79 \\left(\\frac{99424.2}{101325}\\right) = \\frac{78545.118}{101325} \\approx 0.77518$$\nTo convert these mole fractions to mass fractions, we first find the mean molecular weight of the humid air (oxidizer), $W_{\\text{ox}}$:\n$$W_{\\text{ox}} = y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}W_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + y_{\\mathrm{N_2}}W_{\\mathrm{N_2}} + y_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}W_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$$\nUsing the given molecular masses $W_{\\mathrm{O_2}}=31.998\\,\\mathrm{kg/kmol}$, $W_{\\mathrm{N_2}}=28.014\\,\\mathrm{kg/kmol}$, and $W_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}=18.015\\,\\mathrm{kg/kmol}$:\n$$W_{\\text{ox}} = \\left(\\frac{20879.082}{101325}\\right)(31.998) + \\left(\\frac{78545.118}{101325}\\right)(28.014) + \\left(\\frac{1900.8}{101325}\\right)(18.015)$$\n$$W_{\\text{ox}} \\approx (0.20606)(31.998) + (0.77518)(28.014) + (0.018759)(18.015)$$\n$$W_{\\text{ox}} \\approx 6.59353 + 21.71536 + 0.33792 \\approx 28.6468\\,\\mathrm{kg/kmol}$$\nThe mass fraction of oxygen in the oxidizer stream, $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}}$, is:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}} = \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} W_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}{W_{\\text{ox}}} = \\frac{(0.2060606...) \\times 31.998}{28.6468} \\approx \\frac{6.59353}{28.6468} \\approx 0.230167$$\nNow we have both $L_s$ and $Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,ox}}$.

The presence of humidity in the air slightly displaces oxygen, resulting in a slightly lower oxygen mass fraction compared to dry air ($Y_{\\mathrm{O_2,dry}} \\approx 0.2329$).

            "solution": "The problem asks for the numerical solution of a simplified unsteady flamelet equation, which is a one-dimensional parabolic partial differential equation (PDE), to determine the ignition time for several sets of physical parameters.\n\nFirst, we validate the origin and form of the governing equation. The problem begins with the general conservation equation for a chemical species mass fraction $Y_i$ in a fluid. Under the stated assumptions of constant density $\\rho$ and equal species diffusivities $D_i=D$ (implying unity Lewis numbers), the species transport equation is:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial Y_i}{\\partial t} + \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla Y_i = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j}_i + \\dot{\\omega}_i\n$$\nUsing Fick's law for the diffusive flux, $\\mathbf{j}_i = -\\rho D \\nabla Y_i$, and constant density, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Y_i}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla Y_i = D \\nabla^2 Y_i + \\frac{\\dot{\\omega}_i}{\\rho}\n$$\nThe Shvab-Zeldovich formulation introduces a conserved scalar, the mixture fraction $Z$, which has no source term and is governed by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla Z = D \\nabla^2 Z\n$$\nA coordinate transformation is applied, from physical coordinates $(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ to mixture fraction coordinates $(Z, t)$. For any scalar quantity $\\phi$ expressed as a function of $Z$ and $t$, its transport equation $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla \\phi = D \\nabla^2 \\phi + S_\\phi$ can be transformed. Using the chain rule, the derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{Z} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial Z}\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\phi = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial Z} \\nabla Z\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial Z^2} (\\nabla Z \\cdot \\nabla Z) + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial Z} \\nabla^2 Z = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial Z^2} |\\nabla Z|^2 + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial Z} \\nabla^2 Z\n$$\nSubstituting these into the transport equation for $\\phi$ yields:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial Z}\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial t} \\right) + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial Z} \\nabla Z \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial Z^2} |\\nabla Z|^2 + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial Z} \\nabla^2 Z \\right) + S_\\phi\n$$\nRearranging and using the transport equation for $Z$ to substitute for the term $\\frac{\\partial Z}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla Z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial Z} \\left( D \\nabla^2 Z \\right) = D \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial Z^2} |\\nabla Z|^2 + D \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial Z} \\nabla^2 Z + S_\\phi\n$$\nThe terms involving $\\nabla^2 Z$ cancel, leaving:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = D |\\nabla Z|^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial Z^2} + S_\\phi\n$$\nBy defining the scalar dissipation rate as $\\chi(Z,t) = 2D |\\nabla Z|^2$, we arrive at the general form of the unsteady flamelet equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\chi(Z,t)}{2}\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial Z^2} + S_{\\phi}(Z,t)\n$$\nThis derivation confirms the theoretical soundness of the model provided in the problem.\n\nThe specific problem to be solved is a specialization of this equation for a progress variable $C(Z,t)$ on the domain $Z \\in [0,1]$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\chi(t)}{2}\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial Z^2} + \\mathrm{Da}\\,G(Z;Z_{\\mathrm{st}},\\sigma_R)\\,C\\,(1-C)\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $C(0,t)=0$, $C(1,t)=0$, and initial condition $C(Z,0) = \\varepsilon\\,G(Z;Z_{\\mathrm{st}},\\sigma_R)$. For the simulations starting at $t=0$, the scalar dissipation rate is constant, $\\chi(t) = \\chi_{\\mathrm{lo}}$. The parameter $\\chi_{\\mathrm{hi}}$ pertains to the system state before $t=0$ and is not used in the simulation for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nWe solve this PDE using the method of lines. The spatial domain $Z \\in [0,1]$ is discretized into $N_Z$ uniformly spaced points $Z_j = j \\cdot \\Delta Z$ for $j=0, 1, \\dots, N_Z-1$, where $\\Delta Z = 1/(N_Z-1)$. Let $C_j(t)$ denote the numerical approximation of $C(Z_j, t)$. The second spatial derivative (Laplacian) at the interior grid points ($j=1, \\dots, N_Z-2$) is approximated using a second-order central finite difference scheme:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial Z^2}\\right|_{Z_j} \\approx \\frac{C_{j+1}(t) - 2C_j(t) + C_{j-1}(t)}{(\\Delta Z)^2}\n$$\nThis discretization transforms the single PDE into a system of $N_Z-2$ coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the interior points. The ODE for each $C_j(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_j}{dt} = \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathrm{lo}}}{2} \\left( \\frac{C_{j+1} - 2C_j + C_{j-1}}{(\\Delta Z)^2} \\right) + \\mathrm{Da}\\,G(Z_j)\\,C_j\\,(1-C_j)\n$$\nThe Dirichlet boundary conditions $C_0(t)=0$ and $C_{N_Z-1}(t)=0$ are enforced directly in the equations for $C_1$ and $C_{N_Z-2}$.\n\nThis system of ODEs is known to be stiff due to the strong coupling introduced by the discretized diffusion term, especially for fine grids (small $\\Delta Z$). We use a suitable stiff ODE solver, `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` with the `BDF` (Backward Differentiation Formula) method, to integrate the system in time from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\max}$.\n\nThe ignition time, $t_{\\mathrm{ign}}$, is defined as the first time $t \\ge 0$ at which the ignition indicator $I(t) = \\max_{Z \\in [0,1]} C(Z,t)$ reaches a given threshold $\\theta$. This is implemented using the event detection capability of the ODE solver. We define an event function $e(t, \\mathbf{C}) = \\max(\\mathbf{C}) - \\theta$, where $\\mathbf{C}$ is the vector of interior $C_j$ values. The solver is configured to find the root of this function (where $e=0$) and terminate the integration. The time of this event is $t_{\\mathrm{ign}}$. If the integration completes up to $t_{\\max}$ without the event occurring, it signifies failed ignition, and $t_{\\mathrm{ign}}$ is reported as $-1$.\n\nFor the numerical implementation, a sufficiently fine grid with $N_Z=401$ points is used to ensure resolution of the narrow reaction zones, particularly in Case C. The initial condition is evaluated on this grid using the prescribed value of $\\varepsilon=10^{-4}$.",
