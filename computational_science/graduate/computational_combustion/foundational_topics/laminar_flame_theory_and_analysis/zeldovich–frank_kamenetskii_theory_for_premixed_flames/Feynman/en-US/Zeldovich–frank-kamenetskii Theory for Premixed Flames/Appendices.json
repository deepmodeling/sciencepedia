            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the peak chemical source term and its location within the inner reaction zone of a premixed flame, employing the Zeldovich–Frank-Kamenetskii (ZFK) theory. The analysis is performed under the assumptions of a steady, planar, one-dimensional flame with unity Lewis number, constant thermophysical properties, and a single-step Arrhenius reaction mechanism.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the fuel mass fraction, $Y$, and the local temperature, $T$. The problem specifies a unity Lewis number, $\\Le = \\frac{\\alpha}{D} = 1$, where $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity and $D$ is the mass diffusivity. For a one-step, irreversible reaction (Fuel $\\rightarrow$ Products), the conservation equations for species and energy, under these assumptions, can be combined to yield a linear relationship between $Y$ and $T$. This is known as a Shvab-Zeldovich coupling. We define normalized variables for temperature and mass fraction. Let the normalized temperature be $\\theta = \\frac{T - T_u}{T_b - T_u}$, where $T_u$ and $T_b$ are the unburned and burned gas temperatures, respectively. Let the normalized fuel mass fraction be $y = \\frac{Y}{Y_u}$, where $Y_u$ is the fuel mass fraction in the unburned mixture. In the unburned state ($T=T_u$, $Y=Y_u$), we have $\\theta=0$ and $y=1$. In the fully burned state ($T=T_b$, $Y=0$), we have $\\theta=1$ and $y=0$. The coupling relationship for $\\Le=1$ is given by:\n$$ \\theta + y = 1 $$\nFrom this relation, we can express the fuel mass fraction $Y$ as a function of temperature $T$:\n$$ \\frac{Y}{Y_u} = 1 - \\theta = 1 - \\frac{T - T_u}{T_b - T_u} = \\frac{(T_b - T_u) - (T - T_u)}{T_b - T_u} $$\n$$ Y(T) = Y_u \\left( \\frac{T_b - T}{T_b - T_u} \\right) $$\nThis expression holds throughout the entire flame structure.\n\nNext, we formulate the temperature-dependent chemical source term, $\\omega(T)$. The source term is given by the Arrhenius law:\n$$ \\omega(T,Y) = A\\,Y\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $Y(T)$ into the Arrhenius law gives the source term as a function of temperature alone:\n$$ \\omega(T) = A \\left( Y_u \\frac{T_b - T}{T_b - T_u} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T}\\right) $$\n\nThe ZFK theory is based on a large-activation-energy asymptotic analysis, which posits that the chemical reaction is significant only in a very narrow region where the temperature is close to the final burned temperature, $T_b$. In this region, we perform a first-order Frank-Kamenetskii expansion of the reciprocal temperature, $1/T$, in the exponential term. We define a small temperature deficit, $\\tau = T_b - T$, such that $T = T_b - \\tau$. For $\\tau \\ll T_b$, the expansion is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{T_b - \\tau} = \\frac{1}{T_b(1 - \\tau/T_b)} \\approx \\frac{1}{T_b}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\tau}{T_b}\\right) = \\frac{1}{T_b} + \\frac{T_b - T}{T_b^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the exponential part of the source term yields:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T}\\right) \\approx \\exp\\left[-\\frac{E_a}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_b} + \\frac{T_b - T}{T_b^2}\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T_b}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a (T_b - T)}{R T_b^2}\\right) $$\nNow, substituting this approximation back into the expression for $\\omega(T)$, we obtain the source term valid within the inner reaction zone:\n$$ \\omega(T) \\approx A Y_u \\left( \\frac{T_b - T}{T_b - T_u} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T_b}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a (T_b - T)}{R T_b^2}\\right) $$\n\nTo find the peak source term, $\\omega_{\\max}$, we must find the temperature, $T_{\\text{peak}}$, at which $\\omega(T)$ is maximum. We can do this by differentiating $\\omega(T)$ with respect to $T$ and setting the result to zero. To simplify, let us define a variable $x = T_b - T$. The expression for $\\omega$ becomes a function of $x$:\n$$ \\omega(x) \\approx \\left[ \\frac{A Y_u}{T_b - T_u} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T_b}\\right) \\right] x \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a x}{R T_b^2}\\right) $$\nLet $C_1 = \\frac{A Y_u}{T_b - T_u} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T_b}\\right)$ and $C_2 = \\frac{E_a}{R T_b^2}$. The function to maximize is $\\omega(x) = C_1 x \\exp(-C_2 x)$. Differentiating with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\omega}{dx} = C_1 \\left( \\exp(-C_2 x) - C_2 x \\exp(-C_2 x) \\right) = C_1 \\exp(-C_2 x) (1 - C_2 x) $$\nSetting the derivative to zero, since $C_1 > 0$ and $\\exp(-C_2 x) > 0$, we must have:\n$$ 1 - C_2 x = 0 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{C_2} $$\nThis value of $x$ corresponds to the temperature deficit at the peak, $\\Delta T_{\\text{peak}} = T_b - T_{\\text{peak}}$. Substituting back the expression for $C_2$:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{1}{C_2} = \\frac{R T_b^2}{E_a} $$\nThis is the location of the peak source term, expressed as a temperature difference from the burned gas temperature. This result depends on $R$, $T_b$, and $E_a$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the peak source term, $\\omega_{\\max}$, by substituting $x_{\\text{peak}} = 1/C_2$ back into the expression for $\\omega(x)$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\max} = \\omega(x_{\\text{peak}}) = C_1 x_{\\text{peak}} \\exp(-C_2 x_{\\text{peak}}) $$\nSince $C_2 x_{\\text{peak}} = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\omega_{\\max} = C_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{C_2}\\right) \\exp(-1) = \\frac{C_1}{e C_2} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\max} = \\frac{\\frac{A Y_u}{T_b - T_u} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T_b}\\right)}{e \\left(\\frac{E_a}{R T_b^2}\\right)} $$\n$$ \\omega_{\\max} = \\frac{A Y_u R T_b^2}{e E_a (T_b - T_u)} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_b}\\right) $$\nThis expression for the maximum reaction rate, $\\omega_{\\max}$, depends on all the required parameters: $A$, $Y_u$, $R$, $T_b$, $T_u$, and $E_a$.\n\nThe two required quantities are thus derived as closed-form expressions.",

The analysis is restricted to diffusive–thermal effects, neglecting hydrodynamic instabilities.\n\nThe starting point is the kinematic evolution of the flame front. A point on the flame surface moves with a velocity equal to the local burning velocity, $S_b$, in the direction normal to the front. Let the flame front position be described by $x = x_f(y,t)$. The planar flame without perturbation would propagate at the laminar flame speed $S_L$, so its position would be $x = S_L t$. We introduce a small perturbation $\\xi(y,t)$ such that $x_f(y,t) = S_L t + \\xi(y,t)$.\n\nThe velocity of a point on the front in the $x$-direction is $\\frac{\\partial x_f}{\\partial t}$.
