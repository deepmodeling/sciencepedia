Consider a one-dimensional stack of layers adjacent to the wall that will be extruded tangentially to form the near-wall mesh for the full flow domain. The stack uses a geometric progression of layer thicknesses, with constant growth factor $g1$, such that the thickness of the $k$-th layer is $\\,\\Delta y_k\\,$ and satisfies $\\,\\Delta y_k = \\Delta y_1\\, g^{\\,k-1}\\,$ for $\\,k=1,2,\\dots,N\\,$.

It describes a standard method for generating a boundary layer mesh in computational fluid dynamics, using a geometric progression for layer thicknesses. All necessary parameters are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be determined.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the total thickness $\\delta$ of the boundary-layer mesh and the thicknesses of the individual layers, $\\Delta y_k$. The total thickness is the sum of the $N$ individual layer thicknesses:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\Delta y_k\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the layer thicknesses follow a geometric progression with a constant growth factor $g$.

In our case, the first term is $g^0 = 1$, the common ratio is $g$, and there are $N$ terms. Thus, the sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} g^j = \\frac{g^N - 1}{g - 1}\n$$\nThis formula is valid since the problem specifies $g  1$, so the denominator $g-1$ is non-zero.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\Delta y_1 \\left( \\frac{g^N - 1}{g - 1} \\right)\n$$\n\nWe can now solve for $\\Delta y_1$, the thickness of the first layer:\n$$\n\\Delta y_1 = \\delta \\left( \\frac{g - 1}{g^N - 1} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for $\\Delta y_1$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for $\\Delta y_N$, the thickness of the $N$-th (outermost) layer.

We consider a single Fourier mode of the solution for the numerical error, represented as:\n$$\nY_j^n = G^n \\exp(i k x_j) = G^n \\exp(i k j \\Delta x)\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the wavenumber, $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, and $G$ is the amplification factor per time step.

This occurs when $\\sin^2(k \\Delta x/2)$ is maximum. The maximum value of $\\sin^2(\\cdot)$ is $1$.

The core issue stems from the scaling relationship $\\Delta t \\propto (\\Delta x)^2$.\n\n1.  **Mesh Resolution and Time-Step Restriction**: Reacting flows, such as laminar or turbulent flames, are characterized by extremely thin layers where temperature and species concentrations exhibit very steep gradients. To accurately capture the physics within these layers (e.g., flame structure, propagation speed, pollutant formation), the computational mesh must be highly resolved. This necessitates a very small grid spacing, $\\Delta x$. The quadratic dependence in the stability constraint means that reducing $\\Delta x$ to improve spatial accuracy imposes a severe, quadratic penalty on the maximum allowable time step $\\Delta t$. For instance, halving the grid spacing $\\Delta x$ to double the resolution forces a four-fold reduction in $\\Delta t$. This makes simulations with explicit diffusion schemes prohibitively expensive for finely resolved grids.\n\n2.  **Interaction with Chemical Stiffness**: Combustion chemistry is described by a large set of stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Stiffness arises from the vast range of characteristic time scales of the chemical reactions, from very fast radical chain reactions (nanoseconds or faster) to slower heat release processes (microseconds or milliseconds). Explicit time integration of these chemical source terms would require a time step on the order of the fastest chemical time scale, which is often impractically small. Thus, stiff ODE solvers, which are implicit, are almost universally used for the chemistry sub-step in operator-split methods.\n    The problem arises when the explicit diffusion time-step limit, $\\Delta t_{\\max} \\propto (\\Delta x)^2$, becomes even more restrictive than the time scales of the chemistry or convection. In the example calculated, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ is approximately $15.6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$. While this is a small time step, in turbulent combustion (Direct Numerical Simulation or Large Eddy Simulation), resolving the smallest turbulent scales (Kolmogorov scales) and steep flame structures can require $\\Delta x$ to be on the order of micrometers. A simple calculation with $\\Delta x = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$ would yield $\\Delta t_{\\max} \\approx 2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{s}$ ($25\\ \\mathrm{ns}$), which begins to approach the time scales of chemical stiffness. For even finer grids, the diffusion constraint becomes the primary bottleneck, dictating the overall simulation time step and rendering the computation extremely costly.\n\n3.  **Grid Topology and Solver Strategy**: The severe penalty of explicit diffusion on fine meshes drives specific choices in grid topology and numerical methods.\n    *   **Non-Uniform/Adaptive Meshing**: To mitigate cost, it is standard practice to use non-uniform grids, where the mesh is very fine only in regions of high gradients (the reactive layers) and coarse elsewhere. However, with a global time-stepping explicit scheme, the smallest cell in the entire domain dictates the time step for all cells. This means that even a small, highly refined region will force the entire simulation to advance at a cripplingly slow pace.\n    *   **Implicit Diffusion Solvers**: To overcome the diffusive CFL constraint, the most common strategy is to treat the diffusion term implicitly (e.g., using the Crank-Nicolson or backward Euler schemes). These schemes are unconditionally stable for the linear diffusion problem, allowing the time step $\\Delta t$ to be chosen based on accuracy requirements or other physical constraints (like the convective CFL condition), rather than numerical stability. The trade-off is that an implicit solve requires constructing and solving a large sparse system of linear equations at each time step, which has a higher computational cost per step but is ultimately far more efficient overall because of the much larger $\\Delta t$ it permits.\n    *   **Operator Splitting**: In practice, high-fidelity reacting flow solvers often use operator-splitting techniques. A typical approach is to split the governing equations into substeps for convection, diffusion, and reaction. Convection might be handled explicitly (subject to a less restrictive $\\Delta t \\propto \\Delta x$ constraint), while diffusion is treated implicitly, and chemistry is handled by a specialized stiff ODE solver. This hybrid approach allows for an optimal choice of numerical method for each physical process, balancing stability, accuracy, and computational cost.\n\nIn summary, the $\\Delta t \\propto (\\Delta x)^2$ scaling of explicit diffusion forces a move away from simple explicit schemes towards more complex but efficient implicit or semi-implicit methods for the diffusion term, and it strongly motivates the use of adaptive or non-uniform grids to localize high resolution only where physically necessary.",
