            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical thermodynamics, is well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. We will therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis: first, a justification of the thermochemical treatment of elemental substances; second, a derivation of the reaction enthalpy expression using Hess's law; and third, the numerical evaluation of this enthalpy.\n\nFirst, we address the role of elemental oxygen, $\\mathrm{O_2(g)}$, and the value of its standard enthalpy of formation. The standard enthalpy of formation, denoted $\\Delta H_f^\\circ$, is defined as the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance is formed from its constituent elements in their respective standard states at a specified temperature and standard pressure ($1\\ \\mathrm{bar}$). The standard state of an element is its most stable form under these conditions. For oxygen at $298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $1\\ \\mathrm{bar}$, the standard state is gaseous dioxygen, $\\mathrm{O_2(g)}$.\n\nTo determine the standard enthalpy of formation of $\\mathrm{O_2(g)}$, we must consider the reaction that forms one mole of $\\mathrm{O_2(g)}$ from its constituent element (oxygen) in its standard state ($\\mathrm{O_2(g)}$). This notional reaction is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{O_2(g)} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{O_2(g)}\n$$\nEnthalpy is a state function, meaning its change, $\\Delta H$, depends only on the initial and final states of the system. In this case, the initial and final states are identical. Consequently, the enthalpy change for this process is necessarily zero. Thus, by definition, the standard enthalpy of formation of any element in its standard state is zero. For oxygen:\n$$\n\\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{O_2(g)}) = 0\n$$\nThis convention is consistent with Hess’s law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a chemical reaction is independent of the pathway taken. Hess's law is concerned with enthalpy *differences* ($\\Delta H$), not absolute enthalpy values (which are not experimentally accessible). By defining the enthalpy of formation of elements in their standard states as the zero-point on the enthalpy scale, we establish a common, convenient reference from which the enthalpies of all compounds can be measured. Any other choice for this reference point would be an arbitrary constant added to the enthalpy of every substance. When calculating a reaction enthalpy as the difference between product and reactant enthalpies, such a constant would cancel out, leaving the final $\\Delta H^\\circ$ unchanged. Therefore, the convention $\\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\text{element, std. state}) = 0$ is a matter of convenience that does not compromise the physical reality described by Hess's law.\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the standard reaction enthalpy, $\\Delta H^\\circ$, for the reaction:\n$$\n2\\mathrm{NO(g)} + \\mathrm{O_2(g)} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{NO_2(g)}\n$$\nWe apply Hess's law by constructing a hypothetical two-step pathway from reactants to products, passing through the constituent elements in their standard states ($\\mathrm{N_2(g)}$ and $\\mathrm{O_2(g)}$).\n\nStep $1$: Decomposition of reactants into their constituent elements.\nThe decomposition of $2$ moles of $\\mathrm{NO(g)}$ is the reverse of its formation reaction. The formation of $1$ mole of $\\mathrm{NO(g)}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{N_2(g)} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{O_2(g)} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{NO(g)}$, with enthalpy change $\\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{NO(g)})$. Therefore, the reaction $2\\mathrm{NO(g)} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{N_2(g)} + \\mathrm{O_2(g)}$ has an enthalpy change of $-2 \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{NO(g)})$. The other reactant, $\\mathrm{O_2(g)}$, is already an element in its standard state, so its enthalpy of decomposition is zero, which is consistent with $-\\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{O_2(g)}) = -0 = 0$.\nThe total enthalpy change for Step $1$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta H_1 = -[2 \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{NO(g)}) + 1 \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{O_2(g)})]\n$$\nStep $2$: Formation of products from the constituent elements.\nThe formation of $2$ moles of $\\mathrm{NO_2(g)}$ from its elements is $\\mathrm{N_2(g)} + 2\\mathrm{O_2(g)} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{NO_2(g)}$. The enthalpy change for this step is $2 \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{NO_2(g)})$.\nThe enthalpy change for Step $2$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta H_2 = 2 \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{NO_2(g)})\n$$\nAccording to Hess's law, the standard reaction enthalpy $\\Delta H^\\circ$ is the sum of the enthalpy changes of the steps: $\\Delta H^\\circ = \\Delta H_1 + \\Delta H_2$.\n$$\n\\Delta H^\\circ = \\left( 2 \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{NO_2(g)}) \\right) - \\left( 2 \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{NO(g)}) + 1 \\times \\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{O_2(g)}) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the general expression derived from first principles. It is an application of the general formula $\\Delta H^\\circ = \\sum_{\\text{products}} \\nu_p \\Delta H_f^\\circ(P) - \\sum_{\\text{reactants}} \\nu_r \\Delta H_f^\\circ(R)$, where $\\nu$ represents the stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data:\n$\\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{NO(g)}) = +90.25\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{NO_2(g)}) = +33.18\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$\nAnd from our preceding analysis, $\\Delta H_f^\\circ(\\mathrm{O_2(g)}) = 0\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\Delta H^\\circ = \\left( 2 \\times (+33.18\\ \\mathrm{kJ}) \\right) - \\left( 2 \\times (+90.25\\ \\mathrm{kJ}) + 1 \\times (0\\ \\mathrm{kJ}) \\right)\n$$\nThe calculation yields:\n$$\n\\Delta H^\\circ = 66.36\\ \\mathrm{kJ} - (180.50\\ \\mathrm{kJ} + 0\\ \\mathrm{kJ})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H^\\circ = 66.36\\ \\mathrm{kJ} - 180.50\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H^\\circ = -114.14\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

This is equivalent to the matrix product $AS$ being the zero matrix.\n$$AS = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1/2 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 3 & 1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$(AS)_{11} = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) = 0$$\n$$(AS)_{12} = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) = 0$$\n$$(AS)_{13} = 0$$\n$$(AS)_{21} = (4)(-1) + (2)(3) + (2)(-1) = -4 + 6 - 2 = 0$$\n$$(AS)_{22} = (2)(1) + (2)(-1) = 0$$\n$$(AS)_{23} = (2)(-1) + (2)(1) = 0$$\n$$(AS)_{31} = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) = 0$$\n$$(AS)_{32} = (1)(-1) + (2)(1) + (1)(-1) = -1 + 2 - 1 = 0$$\n$$(AS)_{33} = (2)(-1/2) + (1)(1) = -1 + 1 = 0$$\nThus, we obtain the $3 \\times 3$ zero matrix, confirming that all three reactions conserve C, H, and O atoms.\n$$AS = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we compute the standard heat of reaction, $\\Delta H_j^{\\circ}$, for each reaction $j$ using the standard enthalpies of formation, $\\Delta H_{f,i}^{\\circ}$:\n$$\\Delta H_j^{\\circ} = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\nu_{ij} \\Delta H_{f,i}^{\\circ}$$\nThe provided data are: $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(\\text{CH}_4) = -74.873$, $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(\\text{O}_2) = 0$, $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(\\text{CO}) = -110.530$, $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(\\text{CO}_2) = -393.522$, $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(\\text{H}_2) = 0$, and $\\Delta H_{f}^{\\circ}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) = -241.826$, all in $\\text{kJ/mol}$.\n\nFor Reaction $A$: $\\text{CH}_4 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{CO} + 3\\,\\text{H}_2$\n$$\\Delta H_A^{\\circ} = [1 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{CO}) + 3 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{H}_2)] - [1 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{CH}_4) + 1 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})]$$\n$$\\Delta H_A^{\\circ} = [-110.530 + 3(0)] - [-74.873 - 241.826] = -110.530 - (-316.699) = 206.169~\\text{kJ/mol}$$\n\nFor Reaction $B$: $\\text{CO} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2$\n$$\\Delta H_B^{\\circ} = [1 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{CO}_2) + 1 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{H}_2)] - [1 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{CO}) + 1 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})]$$\n$$\\Delta H_B^{\\circ} = [-393.522 + 0] - [-110.530 - 241.826] = -393.522 - (-352.356) = -41.166~\\text{kJ/mol}$$\n\nFor Reaction $C$: $\\text{H}_2 + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n$$\\Delta H_C^{\\circ} = [1 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})] - [1 \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{H}_2) + \\tfrac{1}{2} \\cdot \\Delta H_f^{\\circ}(\\text{O}_2)]$$\n$$\\Delta H_C^{\\circ} = [-241.826] - [0 + \\tfrac{1}{2}(0)] = -241.826~\\text{kJ/mol}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the composite reaction $R_{\\text{tot}} = A + B + 4C$. The net stoichiometric vector $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}_{\\text{tot}}$ is the linear combination of the individual reaction vectors: $\\boldsymbol{\\nu}_{\\text{tot}} = \\boldsymbol{\\nu}_A + \\boldsymbol{\\nu}_B + 4\\boldsymbol{\\nu}_C$.\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\nu}_{\\text{tot}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 3 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} + 4\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1-1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 3+1-4 \\\\ -1-1+4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis vector corresponds to species coefficients: $\\nu_{\\text{CH}_4}=-1$, $\\nu_{\\text{O}_2}=-2$, $\\nu_{\\text{CO}}=0$, $\\nu_{\\text{CO}_2}=1$, $\\nu_{\\text{H}_2}=0$, $\\nu_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}=2$.
