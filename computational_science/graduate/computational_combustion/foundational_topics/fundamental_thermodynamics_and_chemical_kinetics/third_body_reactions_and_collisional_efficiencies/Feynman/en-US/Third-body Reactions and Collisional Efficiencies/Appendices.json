The overall efficiency of a third-body reaction, therefore, depends on the collective behavior of all species present. This exercise  introduces the fundamental concept of a 'mixture-averaged collisional efficiency', providing a hands-on calculation for this critical parameter. Mastering this allows for the accurate modeling of reaction rates in the multi-component environments typical of practical combustion devices.",

In the low-pressure limit, the rate law contains the effective third-body number density, which by definition is the number-density-weighted sum of species-specific collisional efficiencies. Consider an ideal-gas mixture at a fixed thermodynamic state with mole fractions $X_{\\mathrm{N_2}}=0.7$, $X_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}=0.2$, and $X_{\\mathrm{Ar}}=0.1$. The species-specific collisional efficiencies are $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{N_2}}=1.0$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}=2.0$, and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Ar}}=0.6$.\n\nStarting from the ideal-gas relation between species number densities and their mole fractions, and from the definition that the effective third-body concentration is the sum over species of their number densities weighted by their collisional efficiencies, derive an expression for the mixture-averaged collisional efficiency $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ in terms of $\\{X_i\\}$ and $\\{\\alpha_i\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the mixture-averaged collisional efficiency, $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$, its calculation for a specific mixture, and an interpretation of its role in the reaction rate law.\n\nLet $[M_i]$ be the molar concentration of species $i$ in the gas mixture. The total molar concentration of the mixture is $[M]$, given by the sum of individual species concentrations:\n$$\n[M] = \\sum_i [M_i]\n$$\nThe problem states that the effective third-body concentration, which we denote as $[M]_{\\text{eff}}$, is the sum of the species concentrations, each weighted by its species-specific collisional efficiency, $\\alpha_i$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n[M]_{\\text{eff}} = \\sum_i \\alpha_i [M_i]\n$$\nThe mixture-averaged collisional efficiency, $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$, is defined as the factor that relates the effective third-body concentration to the total concentration of the mixture:\n$$\n[M]_{\\text{eff}} = \\alpha_{\\text{mix}} [M]\n$$\nTo derive the expression for $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$, we equate the two expressions for $[M]_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} [M] = \\sum_i \\alpha_i [M_i]\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ yields:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = \\frac{\\sum_i \\alpha_i [M_i]}{[M]}\n$$\nThe problem instructs us to use the ideal-gas relation between species concentration and mole fraction. For an ideal gas mixture, the mole fraction of species $i$, $X_i$, is the ratio of the molar concentration of species $i$ to the total molar concentration of the mixture:\n$$\nX_i = \\frac{[M_i]}{[M]}\n$$\nSubstituting this relationship into the expression for $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ gives the desired derivation:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\left( \\frac{[M_i]}{[M]} \\right) = \\sum_i \\alpha_i X_i\n$$\nThis result shows that the mixture-averaged collisional efficiency is the mole-fraction-weighted average of the individual species' collisional efficiencies.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ for the given gas mixture.

The temperature-dependent rate is determined by the term $k_0(T)[M]_{\\text{eff}}$.\nUsing the definition of the mixture-averaged efficiency, we can rewrite this term as:\n$$\nk_0(T)[M]_{\\text{eff}} = k_0(T) \\alpha_{\\text{mix}} [M]\n$$\nNow consider the reference case where all species have a collisional efficiency of unity, i.e., $\\alpha_i = 1$ for all $i$. In this hypothetical scenario, the mixture-averaged efficiency would be:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{mix, ref}} = \\sum_i (1) X_i = \\sum_i X_i = 1\n$$\nFor this reference case, the rate-determining term becomes $k_0(T)(1)[M] = k_0(T)[M]$.\nBy comparing the actual case with the reference case, we can see the effect of $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$. The product $k_0(T)[M]$ from the reference case is modified by being multiplied by the factor $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ to obtain the term $k_0(T)\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}[M]$ that governs the rate in the actual mixture. Thus, $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}}$ acts as a direct multiplicative correction factor to the product $k_0(T)[M]$. If $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} > 1$, the reaction is accelerated relative to the reference mixture; if $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} < 1$, it is decelerated. In this specific problem, with $\\alpha_{\\text{mix}} = 1.160$, the effective collisional rate is $16\\%$ higher than it would be in a mixture where all collider efficiencies are unity. The problem is valid. It is a standard exercise in applying the definitions of third-body efficiency in chemical kinetics. The problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution. The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in chemical kinetics concerning pressure-dependent reactions, based on established theoretical frameworks.

The species ($\\mathrm{N_2}$, $\\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\\mathrm{Ar}$) are common bath gases, and the given efficiency values are physically plausible (e.g., polyatomic molecules like $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ are often more efficient colliders than monatomic species like $\\mathrm{Ar}$ in energy transfer).",

If a default assumption $\\alpha_M = 1$ is used for all species, one computes\n$$\n[M_{\\text{eff,default}}] = \\sum_i [i] = C_{\\text{tot}},\n$$\nbecause mole fractions sum to unity, where $C_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total molar concentration. The true value is\n$$\n[M_{\\text{eff,true}}] = \\sum_i \\alpha_i [i] = C_{\\text{tot}} \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i,\n$$\nwhere $x_i$ are mole fractions and $[i] = x_i C_{\\text{tot}}$. The ratio of the default to the true ignition delay is then\n$$\n\\frac{t_{\\text{ign,default}}}{t_{\\text{ign,true}}} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{[M_{\\text{eff,true}}]}{[M_{\\text{eff,default}}]} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ C_{\\text{tot}} \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i }{ C_{\\text{tot}} } } = \\sqrt{ \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i }.\n$$\nThe magnitude of the relative error is\n$$\ne = \\left| \\frac{ t_{\\text{ign,default}} - t_{\\text{ign,true}} }{ t_{\\text{ign,true}} } \\right| = \\left| \\frac{ t_{\\text{ign,default}} }{ t_{\\text{ign,true}} } - 1 \\right| = \\left| \\sqrt{ \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i } - 1 \\right|.\n$$\nThis demonstrates that using $\\alpha_M = 1$ can either underpredict or overpredict ignition delay, depending on whether $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i$ is less than or greater than $1$, respectively.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each test case:\n- Compute $C_{\\text{tot}} = P/(R_u T)$ in $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$ using the Ideal Gas Law.\n- Compute $[M_{\\text{eff,true}}] = C_{\\text{tot}} \\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i$ and $[M_{\\text{eff,default}}] = C_{\\text{tot}}$.\n- Compute $K_{\\text{true}} = k_t [M_{\\text{eff,true}}]$ and $K_{\\text{default}} = k_t [M_{\\text{eff,default}}]$ in $\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n- Compute $t_{\\text{ign,true}} = \\operatorname{arctanh}(\\beta) / \\sqrt{ P_{\\text{prod}} K_{\\text{true}} }$ and $t_{\\text{ign,default}} = \\operatorname{arctanh}(\\beta) / \\sqrt{ P_{\\text{prod}} K_{\\text{default}} }$ in $\\text{s}$.\n- Compute $e = \\left| (t_{\\text{ign,default}} - t_{\\text{ign,true}})/t_{\\text{ign,true}} \\right|$ and round to six decimal places.\n\nProperties tested by the suite:\n- Case $1$ (dry hydrogen-air): $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i < 1$, showing underprediction of ignition delay when using $\\alpha_M=1$.\n- Case $2$ (humid hydrogen-air): $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i > 1$ due to high $\\alpha_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}$, showing overprediction of ignition delay.\n- Case $3$ (oxygen bath): $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i = 1$, yielding zero error, demonstrating the boundary condition.\n- Case $4$ (argon-diluted): $\\sum_i \\alpha_i x_i \\ll 1$ due to low $\\alpha_{\\text{Ar}}$, showing a large underprediction error.\n\nThe final program implements these steps and prints the list $[e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4]$ as a single line, with each value rounded to six decimal places.",
