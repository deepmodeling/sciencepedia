We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the relationship between a bimolecular rate constant expressed on a number-density basis, $k_n$, and one expressed on a molar-concentration basis, $k_m$. We will then use this relationship to convert a given value of $k_n$ to $k_m$ and verify the dimensional consistency.\n\nLet us consider a general bimolecular reaction between species $A$ and $B$:\n$$ A + B \\rightarrow \\text{Products} $$\nIn this specific problem, the reaction is $\\mathrm{O} + \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{OH} + \\mathrm{H}$, so we can identify $A$ with $\\mathrm{O}$ and $B$ with $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$.\n\nFirst, we apply the law of mass action to express the rate of progress on a number-density basis. The number density, $n_i$, of a species $i$ has units of particles per unit volume (e.g., $\\mathrm{molecule}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ in SI). The rate of progress, which we will denote $\\omega_n$, can be expressed as the rate of consumption of a reactant, for instance, species $A$:\n$$ \\omega_n = -\\frac{dn_A}{dt} = k_n n_A n_B $$\nThe units of the rate constant $k_n$ are determined by this equation.

The analysis is based on canonical Transition State Theory (TST).

The rate of reactive events, as predicted by the flux through the transition state, is proportional to the concentration of reacting pairs. For indistinguishable reactants, the number of distinct pairs is proportional to $[\\mathrm{A}]^2/2$. To reconcile the microscopic flux with the macroscopic rate law, a statistical factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ must be introduced.

The problem states that the transition state, $\\mathrm{H}_{2}^{\\ddagger}$, is a homonuclear diatomic species. Its rotational symmetry number is $\\sigma^{\\ddagger}=2$. The corrected partition function for the transition state, $\\Phi^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{corr}}(T)$, is therefore related to the uncorrected one (which omits this division), $\\Phi^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{uncorr}}(T)$, by:\n$$\n\\Phi^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{corr}}(T) = \\frac{\\Phi^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{uncorr}}(T)}{\\sigma^{\\ddagger}} = \\frac{\\Phi^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{uncorr}}(T)}{2}\n$$\nThe partition function for the reactant hydrogen atom, $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{H}}(T)$, has a symmetry number of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}}=1$, so no correction is needed there.\n\nCombining these two points, the expression for the correct rate coefficient is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{correct}}(T) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{\\Phi^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{corr}}(T)}{(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{H}}(T))^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_0}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Phi^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{corr}}(T)$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{correct}}(T) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{\\Phi^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{uncorr}}(T) / 2}{(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{H}}(T))^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_0}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk_{\\text{correct}}(T) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\frac{k_B T}{h} \\frac{\\Phi^{\\ddagger}_{\\text{uncorr}}(T)}{(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{H}}(T))^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_0}{k_B T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n\nNext, we formulate the expression for the naive rate coefficient, $k_{\\text{naive}}(T)$.

The problem states that all other factors are treated identically and cancel in the ratio.

Neglecting the symmetry number of the transition state ($\\sigma^{\\ddagger}=2$) results in a rate coefficient that is too high by a factor of $2$.

This yields the semiclassical expression for the sum of states:\n$$\nN(E) = \\frac{E^s}{s! \\prod_{i=1}^s \\epsilon_i}\n$$\nThe density of states, $\\rho(E)$, is the number of states per unit energy, obtained by differentiating $N(E)$ with respect to $E$:\n$$\n\\rho(E) = \\frac{dN(E)}{dE} = \\frac{d}{dE} \\left( \\frac{E^s}{s! \\prod_{i=1}^s \\epsilon_i} \\right) = \\frac{s E^{s-1}}{s! \\prod_{i=1}^s \\epsilon_i} = \\frac{E^{s-1}}{(s-1)! \\prod_{i=1}^s \\epsilon_i}\n$$\nNow, we apply these formulas to our system:\n1.  **Reactant Density of States, $\\rho(E)$**:\n    The reactant $\\mathrm{CH_3O_2}$ has $s=12$ vibrational modes with frequencies $\\tilde{\\nu}_i$. The density of states at energy $E$ is:\n    $$\n    \\rho(E) = \\frac{E^{s-1}}{(s-1)! \\prod_{i=1}^{s} (h c \\tilde{\\nu}_i)}\n    $$\n    where $E$ is the total vibrational energy above the reactant's ZPE.\n\n2.  **Transition State Sum of States, $N^\\ddagger(E - E_0)$**:\n    The transition state has $s^\\ddagger = s-1 = 11$ vibrational modes with frequencies $\\tilde{\\nu}_i^\\ddagger$. The energy available to these modes is the total energy $E$ minus the barrier height $E_0$. Thus, for $E  E_0$:\n    $$\n    N^\\ddagger(E - E_0) = \\frac{(E - E_0)^{s^\\ddagger}}{s^\\ddagger! \\prod_{i=1}^{s^\\ddagger} (h c \\tilde{\\nu}_i^\\ddagger)}\n    $$\n    If $E \\le E_0$, the system lacks sufficient energy to reach the transition state, so $N^\\ddagger(E-E_0) = 0$, and consequently, $k(E) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these into the RRKM expression gives the rate coefficient $k(E)$.\n\n**Algorithmic Strategy:**\nThe computation involves terms like $E^s$ and $s!$, where $E$ is very small (on the order of $10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{J}$) and $s$ is moderately large. Direct computation can lead to numerical overflow or underflow. A robust approach is to compute the logarithm of each term.\n\n1.  **Logarithm of Reactant Density of States**:\n    $$\n    \\ln(\\rho(E)) = (s-1)\\ln(E) - \\ln((s-1)!) - \\sum_{i=1}^{s} \\ln(\\epsilon_i)\n    $$\n    We use $\\ln((s-1)!) = \\ln(\\Gamma(s))$, which can be calculated using the `gammaln` function.\n\n2.  **Logarithm of Transition State Sum of States**:\n    $$\n    \\ln(N^\\ddagger(E - E_0)) = s^\\ddagger\\ln(E - E_0) - \\ln(s^\\ddagger!) - \\sum_{i=1}^{s^\\ddagger} \\ln(\\epsilon_i^\\ddagger)\n    $$\n    Here, $\\ln(s^\\ddagger!) = \\ln(\\Gamma(s^\\ddagger+1))$.\n\n3.  **Logarithm of the Rate Coefficient**:\n    $$\n    \\ln(k(E)) = \\ln(N^\\ddagger(E - E_0)) - \\ln(h) - \\ln(\\rho(E))\n    $$\n    The final rate is then $k(E) = \\exp(\\ln(k(E)))$.\n\n**Unit Conversions**: All calculations must be performed in consistent units. We will convert energies from $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ to Joules per molecule, and vibrational frequencies from wavenumbers ($\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) to energy quanta in Joules.\n- Energy conversion: $E_{[\\text{J}]} = E_{[\\text{kJ/mol}]} \\times 1000 / N_A$.\n- Frequency to energy quantum: $\\epsilon_i = h c \\tilde{\\nu}_i$, where $c$ is in $\\mathrm{cm/s}$ to match $\\tilde{\\nu}_i$ in $\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by first converting all inputs to SI units (or compatible units). Then for each given energy $E$, it calculates $\\ln(\\rho(E))$ and $\\ln(N^\\ddagger(E - E_0))$, combines them to find $\\ln(k(E))$, and finally exponentiates to get $k(E)$ in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. For the case $E \\le E_0$, the rate is immediately set to $0.0$.",
