It is a standard derivation in chemical reaction engineering and computational combustion, testing the understanding of the relationship between kinetics and thermodynamics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe derivation begins with the principle of detailed balance, which states that at chemical equilibrium, the rate of every elementary forward reaction is equal to the rate of its corresponding reverse reaction. Let the subscript '$eq$' denote concentrations at equilibrium. At equilibrium, we must have:\n$$r_{f,eq} = r_{r,eq}$$\nSubstituting the given expressions for the forward and reverse rates of progress, $r_{f}$ and $r_{r}$, evaluated at equilibrium conditions:\n$$k_{f} \\prod_{i} c_{i,eq}^{\\nu^{\\prime}_{i}} = k_{r} \\prod_{i} c_{i,eq}^{\\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}$$\nTo find an expression for the reverse rate constant, $k_{r}$, we can rearrange this equation. It is convenient to first solve for the ratio of the rate constants, $k_{f}/k_{r}$:\n$$\\frac{k_{f}}{k_{r}} = \\frac{\\prod_{i} c_{i,eq}^{\\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}}{\\prod_{i} c_{i,eq}^{\\nu^{\\prime}_{i}}}$$\nThe expression on the right-hand side is precisely the definition of the concentration-based equilibrium constant, $K_{c}$, as given in the problem statement. Therefore, we establish the relationship:\n$$\\frac{k_{f}}{k_{r}} = K_{c}$$\nSolving this equation for the reverse rate constant, $k_{r}$, in terms of the forward rate constant, $k_{f}$, and the concentration-based equilibrium constant, $K_{c}$, yields the desired expression:\n$$k_{r} = \\frac{k_{f}}{K_{c}}$$\nThis is the required analytical expression. The problem also asks to demonstrate that this expression ensures $r_{f}$ and $r_{r}$ have identical physical units. We proceed with a dimensional analysis.\n\nLet $[Q]$ denote the physical units of a quantity $Q$. In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of molar concentration, $[c]$, is $\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$. The rate of progress, $r$, has units of concentration per unit time, i.e., $[r] = [\\text{concentration}] \\cdot [\\text{time}]^{-1}$, or $\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFrom the given rate laws, we can determine the units of the rate constants $k_{f}$ and $k_r$.\nFor the forward reaction:\n$$[r_{f}] = [k_{f}] \\prod_{i} [c_{i}]^{\\nu^{\\prime}_{i}} = [k_{f}] [c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu^{\\prime}_{i}}$$\nFor the reverse reaction:\n$$[r_{r}] = [k_{r}] \\prod_{i} [c_{i}]^{\\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}} = [k_{r}] [c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}$$\nFor the rate laws to be physically consistent, the units of $r_f$ and $r_r$ must be identical: $[r_{f}] = [r_{r}] = [r]$. This imposes a constraint on the units of the rate constants:\n$$[k_{f}] [c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu^{\\prime}_{i}} = [k_{r}] [c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}$$\nSolving for the units of $k_{r}$:\n$$[k_{r}] = [k_{f}] \\frac{[c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu^{\\prime}_{i}}}{[c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}} = [k_{f}] [c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu^{\\prime}_{i} - \\sum_{i} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}$$\nUsing the definition $\\Delta \\nu \\equiv \\sum_{i} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime} - \\sum_{i} \\nu^{\\prime}_{i}$:\n$$[k_{r}] = [k_{f}] [c]^{-\\Delta \\nu}$$\nThis is the required dimensional relationship between $[k_{r}]$ and $[k_{f}]$ for the rates $r_f$ and $r_r$ to have the same units.\n\nNow, we check if our derived expression $k_{r} = k_{f}/K_{c}$ satisfies this dimensional requirement. We first need the units of $K_{c}$. From its definition:\n$$[K_{c}] = \\left[\\frac{\\prod_{i} c_{i}^{\\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}}{\\prod_{i} c_{i}^{\\nu^{\\prime}_{i}}}\\right] = \\frac{\\prod_{i} [c_{i}]^{\\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}}{\\prod_{i} [c_{i}]^{\\nu^{\\prime}_{i}}} = \\frac{[c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime}}}{[c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu^{\\prime}_{i}}} = [c]^{\\sum_{i} \\nu_{i}^{\\prime\\prime} - \\sum_{i} \\nu^{\\prime}_{i}} = [c]^{\\Delta \\nu}$$\nNote that for the specified case $\\Delta \\nu \\neq 0$, the equilibrium constant $K_{c}$ is not dimensionless.\n\nNow we find the units of the right-hand side of our derived expression, $k_f / K_c$:\n$$\\left[\\frac{k_{f}}{K_{c}}\\right] = \\frac{[k_{f}]}{[K_{c}]} = \\frac{[k_{f}]}{[c]^{\\Delta \\nu}} = [k_{f}] [c]^{-\\Delta \\nu}$$\nThis result is identical to the required units for $[k_r]$ derived from the consistency of the rate expressions. Thus, the relationship $k_{r} = k_{f}/K_{c}$ is thermodynamically and dimensionally consistent, guaranteeing that the forward and reverse rates of progress possess identical physical units.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a thermodynamically consistent relationship between the forward rate coefficient, $k_f$, and the reverse rate coefficient, $k_r$, for a general elementary gas-phase reaction:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} \\nu_i^{\\prime} X_i \\rightleftharpoons \\sum_{i} \\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} X_i\n$$\nHere, $X_i$ is a chemical species, and $\\nu_i^{\\prime}$ and $\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime}$ are its stoichiometric coefficients as a reactant (forward direction) and product (reverse direction), respectively.\n\nOur derivation will be based on three first principles as requested: (i) the law of mass action for elementary reactions, (ii) the Ideal Gas Law (IGL), and (iii) the thermodynamic definition of the pressure-based equilibrium constant, $K_p$.\n\nFirst, we apply the law of mass action. For an elementary reaction, the forward rate of reaction, $R_f$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient:\n$$\nR_f = k_f \\prod_{i} [X_i]^{\\nu_i^{\\prime}}\n$$\nwhere $[X_i]$ represents the molar concentration of species $X_i$ in units of $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$ and $k_f$ is the forward rate coefficient.\n\nSimilarly, the reverse rate of reaction, $R_r$, is given by:\n$$\nR_r = k_r \\prod_{i} [X_i]^{\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime}}\n$$\nwhere $k_r$ is the reverse rate coefficient.\n\nThe principle of detailed balance requires that at chemical equilibrium, the forward rate must equal the reverse rate for every elementary reaction. Thus, at equilibrium, $R_{f, \\text{eq}} = R_{r, \\text{eq}}$:\n$$\nk_f \\prod_{i} [X_i]_{\\text{eq}}^{\\nu_i^{\\prime}} = k_r \\prod_{i} [X_i]_{\\text{eq}}^{\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime}}\n$$\nwhere the subscript 'eq' denotes equilibrium conditions.\n\nThis equation can be rearranged to relate the ratio of the rate coefficients to the ratio of the products of equilibrium concentrations:\n$$\n\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{\\prod_{i} [X_i]_{\\text{eq}}^{\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime}}}{\\prod_{i} [X_i]_{\\text{eq}}^{\\nu_i^{\\prime}}} = \\prod_{i} [X_i]_{\\text{eq}}^{\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} - \\nu_i^{\\prime}}\n$$\nThe right-hand side of this expression is, by definition, the concentration-based equilibrium constant, $K_c(T)$:\n$$\nK_c(T) = \\prod_{i} [X_i]_{\\text{eq}}^{\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} - \\nu_i^{\\prime}}\n$$\nTherefore, the rate coefficients are directly related through $K_c(T)$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_f(T)}{k_r(T)} = K_c(T)\n$$\n\nNext, we introduce the thermodynamic pressure-based equilibrium constant, $K_p(T)$. For a mixture of ideal gases, the activity of species $i$ is defined as $a_i = p_i / p^\\circ$, where $p_i$ is its partial pressure and $p^\\circ$ is the standard state pressure ($1~\\mathrm{bar}$ or $10^5~\\mathrm{Pa}$). $K_p(T)$ is defined in terms of these activities at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_p(T) = \\prod_{i} a_{i, \\text{eq}}^{(\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} - \\nu_i^{\\prime})} = \\prod_{i} \\left( \\frac{p_{i, \\text{eq}}}{p^\\circ} \\right)^{(\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} - \\nu_i^{\\prime})}\n$$\nWe can separate the pressure terms:\n$$\nK_p(T) = \\frac{\\prod_{i} p_{i, \\text{eq}}^{(\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} - \\nu_i^{\\prime})}}{\\prod_{i} (p^\\circ)^{(\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} - \\nu_i^{\\prime})}} = \\frac{\\prod_{i} p_{i, \\text{eq}}^{(\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} - \\nu_i^{\\prime})}}{(p^\\circ)^{\\sum_i (\\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} - \\nu_i^{\\prime})}}\n$$\nLet $\\Delta \\nu$ be the net change in the total number of moles for the reaction, defined as $\\Delta \\nu = \\sum_i \\nu_i^{\\prime\\prime} - \\sum_i \\nu_i^{\\prime}$.

            "problem": "You are to design and implement a numerical test that verifies detailed balance for individual reversible reactions by computing the forward–reverse rate residual at a composition constrained by the thermodynamic equilibrium constant. The test must be general, transparent, and reproducible. Your program must take a small, specified test suite of reactions and produce a single line of output listing a residual metric for each case.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n- Ideal Gas Law (IGL): partial pressure and concentration of an ideal gas are related by $p_i = C_i R T$, where $p_i$ is partial pressure, $C_i$ is molar concentration in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and $T$ is absolute temperature in $\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Law of Mass Action: for a reaction with net stoichiometry $\\sum_i \\nu_{i,f} X_i \\rightleftharpoons \\sum_i \\nu_{i,r} X_i$, the forward rate is $r_f = k_f \\prod_i C_i^{\\nu_{i,f}}$ and the reverse rate is $r_r = k_r \\prod_i C_i^{\\nu_{i,r}}$, where $k_f$ and $k_r$ are rate coefficients in units consistent with the overall reaction order and concentrations $C_i$ given in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\n- Thermodynamic equilibrium constant: the pressure-based equilibrium constant is $K_p(T) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\Delta G^\\circ_r(T)/(R T)\\right)$, where $\\Delta G^\\circ_r(T)$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction in $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. The concentration-based equilibrium constant is related by $K_p(T) = K_c(T) (R T/p^\\circ)^{\\Delta \\nu}$, with $\\Delta \\nu = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,r} - \\sum_i \\nu_{i,f}$ and a standard pressure of $p^\\circ = 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium and for a mechanism that is thermodynamically consistent, detailed balance holds: $r_f = r_r$ when the composition satisfies $K_c(T)$ and $k_r = k_f / K_c(T)$. Your task is to compute $r_f - r_r$ at the composition that enforces $K_c(T)$ for each reaction, and to demonstrate how violations of thermodynamic consistency manifest when $k_r$ is not computed from $K_c(T)$.\n\nDefine the reaction extent $\\xi$ for a single reaction with initial concentrations $C_{i,0}$ and net stoichiometric signed coefficients $s_i = \\nu_{i,r} - \\nu_{i,f}$, so that $C_i(\\xi) = C_{i,0} + s_i \\xi$. The equilibrium composition for the single-reaction mixture is found by solving the scalar constraint\n$$\n\\frac{\\prod_i C_i(\\xi)^{\\nu_{i,r}}}{\\prod_i C_i(\\xi)^{\\nu_{i,f}}} \\;=\\; K_c(T),\n$$\nsubject to the physical bounds that keep all $C_i(\\xi) \\ge 0$. Use this $\\xi$ to evaluate $r_f$ and $r_r$ and report a normalized residual\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\;=\\; \\frac{r_f - r_r}{\\lvert r_f \\rvert + \\lvert r_r \\rvert + \\varepsilon_0},\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_0$ is a small positive number (use $10^{-300}$) to prevent division by zero. The normalized residual $\\varepsilon$ is dimensionless.\n\nImplement the forward rate coefficient using the Arrhenius form $k_f(T) = A T^n \\exp\\!\\left(-E_a/(R T)\\right)$, where $A$, $n$, and $E_a$ are provided parameters. Units must be consistent: concentrations $C_i$ in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, temperature $T$ in $\\mathrm{K}$, activation energy $E_a$ in $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and time in $\\mathrm{s}$. The units of $A$ depend on the overall reaction order $m = \\sum_i \\nu_{i,f}$: for $m = 1$, $A$ has units $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; for $m = 2$, $A$ has units $\\mathrm{m}^3\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; for $m = 3$, $A$ has units $\\mathrm{m}^6\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and so on.\n\nTest suite. Use the following three cases. In each, compute $K_p(T)$, $K_c(T)$, the equilibrium extent $\\xi$, the forward $k_f(T)$, the reverse $k_r(T)$, rates $r_f$ and $r_r$, and then $\\varepsilon$.\n\n- Case $1$ (thermodynamically consistent, negative $\\Delta \\nu$):\n    - Reaction: $A + B \\rightleftharpoons C$.\n    - Temperature: $T = 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n    - Standard Gibbs free energy of reaction: $\\Delta G^\\circ_r(T) = -20000\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n    - Net stoichiometric coefficients: $\\nu_{A,f} = 1$, $\\nu_{B,f} = 1$, $\\nu_{C,r} = 1$, others zero.

Do not read input; embed the test suite numerics internally.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example: $[r_1,r_2,r_3]$, where each $r_j$ is the computed $\\varepsilon$ for case $j$ as a floating-point number with default Python formatting. The residuals are dimensionless and require no physical unit conversion.",
            "solution": "The goal is to test detailed balance by evaluating the difference $r_f - r_r$ at a composition that enforces the thermodynamic equilibrium constant $K_c(T)$ for each reaction. The reasoning proceeds from first principles.\n\nStart from the Ideal Gas Law (IGL) and the Law of Mass Action. For a single reaction $\\sum_i \\nu_{i,f} X_i \\rightleftharpoons \\sum_i \\nu_{i,r} X_i$, define the signed stoichiometric coefficients $s_i = \\nu_{i,r} - \\nu_{i,f}$. If the reaction proceeds by an extent $\\xi$ starting from initial concentrations $C_{i,0}$, the instantaneous concentrations are $C_i(\\xi) = C_{i,0} + s_i \\xi$. The concentration-based equilibrium constant for the reaction, assuming ideal gas behavior, is related to the pressure-based constant by\n$$\nK_c(T) \\;=\\; K_p(T) \\left(\\frac{p^\\circ}{R T}\\right)^{\\Delta \\nu}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\Delta \\nu \\;=\\; \\sum_i \\nu_{i,r} - \\sum_i \\nu_{i,f}, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad K_p(T) \\;=\\; \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\circ_r(T)}{R T}\\right).\n$$\nThis relationship follows from the definition $K_p = \\prod_i (p_i/p^\\circ)^{\\nu_{i,r}} / \\prod_i (p_i/p^\\circ)^{\\nu_{i,f}}$ and the Ideal Gas Law $p_i = C_i R T$, which yields $K_p = K_c (R T/p^\\circ)^{\\Delta \\nu}$.\n\nThermodynamic consistency and microscopic reversibility imply that at equilibrium $r_f = r_r$, provided that the reverse rate coefficient satisfies $k_r = k_f / K_c(T)$ and the composition enforces $K_c(T)$. To construct a numerical test, we enforce the equilibrium composition through a scalar equation in $\\xi$:\n$$\n\\Phi(\\xi) \\;\\equiv\\; \\frac{\\prod_i C_i(\\xi)^{\\nu_{i,r}}}{\\prod_i C_i(\\xi)^{\\nu_{i,f}}} \\;-\\; K_c(T) \\;=\\; 0.\n$$\nWe solve for $\\xi$ on the admissible interval determined by $C_i(\\xi) \\ge 0$. Specifically, if $s_i  0$, then $\\xi \\le C_{i,0}/(-s_i)$; if $s_i > 0$, then $\\xi \\ge -C_{i,0}/s_i$. In the typical forward progression for reactions initialized with only reactants, we constrain $\\xi \\in [0, \\min_{i: s_i  0} C_{i,0}/(-s_i)]$.\n\nOnce $\\xi$ is found, we compute concentrations $C_i(\\xi)$ and then the forward and reverse rates using the Law of Mass Action:\n$$\nr_f \\;=\\; k_f(T)\\, \\prod_i C_i(\\xi)^{\\nu_{i,f}}, \\qquad k_f(T) \\;=\\; A T^n \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T}\\right),\n$$\n$$\nr_r \\;=\\; k_r(T)\\, \\prod_i C_i(\\xi)^{\\nu_{i,r}}, \\qquad k_r(T) \\;=\\; \\frac{k_f(T)}{K_c(T)} \\quad \\text{(consistent)}.\n$$\nTo demonstrate violations, we set $k_r(T) = \\alpha\\, k_f(T)/K_c(T)$ for some $\\alpha \\ne 1$, thus breaking detailed balance. We then compute the normalized residual\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\;=\\; \\frac{r_f - r_r}{\\lvert r_f \\rvert + \\lvert r_r \\rvert + \\varepsilon_0},\n$$\nwith $\\varepsilon_0 = 10^{-300}$ to avoid division by zero. For a consistent mechanism, the numerator tends to $0$ at equilibrium (up to numerical round-off), yielding $\\varepsilon \\approx 0$. For inconsistent reverse rates, $\\varepsilon$ will be non-zero, scaled by the magnitude of the violation $\\alpha - 1$ and the equilibrium rates.\n\nApply this to the three test cases:\n\nCase $1$: $A + B \\rightleftharpoons C$ at $T = 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\Delta G^\\circ_r = -20000\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. Compute $K_p = \\exp\\!\\left(20000/(8.314462618 \\cdot 1000)\\right)$, then with $\\Delta \\nu = -1$, compute $K_c = K_p (p^\\circ/R T)^{-1} = K_p (R T/p^\\circ)$. The equilibrium constraint reduces to\n$$\n\\frac{C_C}{C_A C_B} \\;=\\; K_c, \\quad C_A = 1 - \\xi, \\; C_B = 1 - \\xi, \\; C_C = \\xi,\n$$\nwhich yields $\\xi$ from $\\xi = K_c (1 - \\xi)^2$. The program solves this via robust root finding. With $k_r = k_f/K_c$, the residual $\\varepsilon$ should be near $0$.\n\nCase $2$: $C \\rightleftharpoons A + B$ at $T = 1200\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\Delta G^\\circ_r = +15000\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. Compute $K_p = \\exp\\!\\left(-15000/(8.314462618 \\cdot 1200)\\right)$, then with $\\Delta \\nu = +1$, compute $K_c = K_p (p^\\circ/R T)^{+1}$. The equilibrium constraint reduces to\n$$\n\\frac{C_A C_B}{C_C} \\;=\\; K_c, \\quad C_C = 1 - \\xi, \\; C_A = \\xi, \\; C_B = \\xi,\n$$\nwhich gives $\\xi^2/(1 - \\xi) = K_c$. With $k_r = \\alpha\\, k_f/K_c$ and $\\alpha = 2.0$, detailed balance is violated and $\\varepsilon$ will be non-zero.\n\nCase $3$: $A + B \\rightleftharpoons D + E$ at $T = 800\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $\\Delta G^\\circ_r = -5000\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. With $\\Delta \\nu = 0$, $K_c = K_p$. The constraint is\n$$\n\\frac{C_D C_E}{C_A C_B} \\;=\\; K_c, \\quad C_A = 0.5 - \\xi, \\; C_B = 0.5 - \\xi, \\; C_D = \\xi, \\; C_E = \\xi,\n$$\nleading to $\\xi^2/(0.5 - \\xi)^2 = K_c$. Because $k_r = k_f/K_c$, the residual should again be near $0$. This case also acts as a boundary with $\\Delta \\nu = 0$, removing the $(RT/p^\\circ)^{\\Delta \\nu}$ factor.\n\nNumerical considerations:\n- Root finding is carried out on the interval constrained by $C_i(\\xi) \\ge 0$.\n- The function is solved in terms of logarithms if necessary to improve robustness, but direct ratio evaluation suffices in these cases.\n- Residual normalization avoids unit dependencies and highlights violations independently of absolute rate magnitudes.\n\nThe final program implements these steps for the specified test suite and prints a single line in the required format $[r_1,r_2,r_3]$.",
