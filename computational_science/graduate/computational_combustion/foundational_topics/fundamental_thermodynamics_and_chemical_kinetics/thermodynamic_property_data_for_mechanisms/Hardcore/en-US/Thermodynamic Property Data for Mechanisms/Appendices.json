Derivation of Thermodynamic Property Expressions**\n\n**Specific Heat Capacity, $c_p^\\circ(T)$**\nThe NASA formulation defines the dimensionless specific heat capacity as a polynomial function of temperature:\n$$ \\frac{c_p^\\circ(T)}{R} = a_1 + a_2 T + a_3 T^2 + a_4 T^3 + a_5 T^4 $$\nMultiplying by the universal gas constant $R$ gives the expression for $c_p^\\circ(T)$:\n$$ c_p^\\circ(T) = R \\left( a_1 + a_2 T + a_3 T^2 + a_4 T^3 + a_5 T^4 \\right) $$\n\n**Standard Molar Enthalpy, $h^\\circ(T)$**\nThe relationship between enthalpy and specific heat capacity is given by $dh^\\circ = c_p^\\circ dT$. Integrating this expression yields the enthalpy:\n$$ h^\\circ(T) = \\int c_p^\\circ(T) dT = \\int R \\left( a_1 + a_2 T + a_3 T^2 + a_4 T^3 + a_5 T^4 \\right) dT $$\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$ h^\\circ(T) = R \\left( a_1 T + \\frac{a_2}{2} T^2 + \\frac{a_3}{3} T^3 + \\frac{a_4}{4} T^4 + \\frac{a_5}{5} T^5 + a_6 \\right) $$\nwhere $a_6$ is the constant of integration. The standard dimensionless form for enthalpy is $\\frac{h^\\circ(T)}{RT}$. Dividing the expression for $h^\\circ(T)$ by $RT$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{h^\\circ(T)}{RT} = a_1 + \\frac{a_2}{2} T + \\frac{a_3}{3} T^2 + \\frac{a_4}{4} T^3 + \\frac{a_5}{5} T^4 + \\frac{a_6}{T} $$\nThus, the expression to recover $h^\\circ(T)$ is:\n$$ h^\\circ(T) = RT \\left( a_1 + \\frac{a_2}{2} T + \\frac{a_3}{3} T^2 + \\frac{a_4}{4} T^3 + \\frac{a_5}{5} T^4 + \\frac{a_6}{T} \\right) $$\n\n**Standard Molar Entropy, $s^\\circ(T)$**\nThe relationship between entropy and specific heat capacity is $ds^\\circ = \\frac{c_p^\\circ(T)}{T} dT$. Integrating yields the entropy:\n$$ s^\\circ(T) = \\int \\frac{c_p^\\circ(T)}{T} dT = \\int \\frac{R}{T} \\left( a_1 + a_2 T + a_3 T^2 + a_4 T^3 + a_5 T^4 \\right) dT $$\n$$ s^\\circ(T) = R \\int \\left( \\frac{a_1}{T} + a_2 + a_3 T + a_4 T^2 + a_5 T^3 \\right) dT $$\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$ s^\\circ(T) = R \\left( a_1 \\ln(T) + a_2 T + \\frac{a_3}{2} T^2 + \\frac{a_4}{3} T^3 + \\frac{a_5}{4} T^4 + a_7 \\right) $$\nwhere $a_7$ is the constant of integration. The dimensionless form for entropy, $\\frac{s^\\circ(T)}{R}$, is directly obtained from this expression:\n$$ \\frac{s^\\circ(T)}{R} = a_1 \\ln(T) + a_2 T + \\frac{a_3}{2} T^2 + \\frac{a_4}{3} T^3 + \\frac{a_5}{4} T^4 + a_7 $$\n\n**2.

Dimensional Analysis of $h^\\circ(T)$**\n\nThe expression for molar enthalpy is $h^\\circ(T) = RT \\times \\left(\\frac{h^\\circ}{RT}\\right)$.\nThe term in parentheses, $\\left(\\frac{h^\\circ}{RT}\\right)$, is the sum of terms $a_1$, $\\frac{a_2}{2}T$, $\\frac{a_3}{3}T^2$, $\\frac{a_4}{4}T^3$, $\\frac{a_5}{5}T^4$, and $\\frac{a_6}{T}$. For these terms to be added, they must all be dimensionless. This implies that the coefficients $a_i$ have units that cancel the units of temperature $T$ raised to the appropriate power. For example, the units of $a_2$ must be $\\mathrm{K^{-1}}$, the units of $a_3$ must be $\\mathrm{K^{-2}}$, and so on. The unit of $a_6$ must be $\\mathrm{K}$. As the coefficients are provided as dimensionless numbers, it is implicitly understood that they are numerical values in a system of units where temperature is expressed in Kelvin. Consequently, the entire sum $\\left(\\frac{h^\\circ}{RT}\\right)$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nThe dimensions of $h^\\circ(T)$ are therefore determined solely by the product $RT$. Let $[X]$ denote the units of a quantity $X$.\nThe units of the universal gas constant are given as $[R] = \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\nThe units of temperature are $[T] = \\mathrm{K}$.\nTherefore, the units of molar enthalpy are:\n$$ [h^\\circ(T)] = [R] \\times [T] = (\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (\\mathrm{K}) = \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThis is a unit of energy per mole, which is the correct SI unit for molar enthalpy. The dimensional analysis confirms the consistency of the formulation.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe calculated value for the standard molar enthalpy of diatomic oxygen at $T=1200 \\, \\mathrm{K}$ is $h^\\circ(1200) \\approx 29.7595 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $29.76 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, presenting a practical and relevant challenge in the field of computational combustion and chemical thermodynamics. The task is to evaluate a series of proposed validation checks for thermodynamic data based on first principles.\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relations for a single-phase ideal gas at standard-state pressure $p^\\circ$ are the basis for this evaluation. The standard-state enthalpy $h^\\circ(T)$ and heat capacity at constant pressure $C_p^\\circ(T)$ are related by the definition of heat capacity:\n$$\nC_p^\\circ(T) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial h^\\circ}{\\partial T}\\right)_p\n$$\nIntegrating this gives the temperature dependence of enthalpy:\n$$\nh^\\circ(T) = h^\\circ(T_{ref}) + \\int_{T_{ref}}^T C_p^\\circ(T') dT'\n$$\nSimilarly, from the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the change in standard-state entropy $s^\\circ(T)$ is given by:\n$$\nds^\\circ = \\frac{dq_{rev,p}}{T} = \\frac{dh^\\circ}{T} = \\frac{C_p^\\circ(T)}{T}dT\n$$\nIntegrating this gives the temperature dependence of entropy:\n$$\ns^\\circ(T) = s^\\circ(T_{ref}) + \\int_{T_{ref}}^T \\frac{C_p^\\circ(T')}{T'} dT'\n$$\nThese relationships, along with fundamental thermodynamic laws and properties of state functions, will be used to analyze each proposed validation check.\n\n**A. For every species and all $T \\in [T_{\\min},T_{\\max}]$, verify $C_p^\\circ(T) > 0$; if violated anywhere, reject the data for that species.**\nThis check is based on the principle of thermodynamic stability. The heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_p = (\\partial H / \\partial T)_p$, must be positive. If $C_p$ were negative, adding heat to the system at constant pressure would cause its temperature to decrease, which is an unstable and unphysical situation. For a gas composed of atoms or molecules, the total energy increases with temperature due to translational, rotational, and vibrational kinetic and potential energies. All contributions to the heat capacity from these modes are non-negative. Therefore, for any physical substance at a temperature $T > 0 \\, \\text{K}$, the heat capacity $C_p^\\circ(T)$ must be strictly positive.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For every species and all $T \\in [T_{\\min},T_{\\max}]$, verify that $s^\\circ(T)$ is nondecreasing in $T$, i.e., $\\dfrac{d s^\\circ}{dT} \\ge 0$ everywhere; if violated, reject the data for that species.**\nFrom the fundamental thermodynamic relation $ds^\\circ = \\frac{C_p^\\circ(T)}{T}dT$, we can write the derivative of entropy with respect to temperature at constant pressure as:\n$$\n\\frac{ds^\\circ}{dT} = \\frac{C_p^\\circ(T)}{T}\n$$\nIn the validity range $[T_{\\min}, T_{\\max}]$, the absolute temperature $T$ is strictly positive. As established in the analysis of option A, thermodynamic stability requires $C_p^\\circ(T) > 0$. Consequently, the ratio $\\frac{C_p^\\circ(T)}{T}$ must be strictly positive for all $T$ in the domain. This implies that $s^\\circ(T)$ must be a strictly increasing function of temperature. A strictly increasing function is, by definition, also nondecreasing. Therefore, this check is a direct consequence of the Second Law and thermodynamic stability.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For every species, verify that $h^\\circ(T)$ and $s^\\circ(T)$ are continuous at $T_{\\mid}$ to within a small numerical tolerance; if either $h^\\circ$ or $s^\\circ$ has a jump at $T_{\\mid}$, reject the data for that species.**\nEnthalpy ($h^\\circ$) and entropy ($s^\\circ$) are state functions. For a substance that is not undergoing a phase transition, its state functions must be continuous with respect to the state variables (in this case, temperature). The piecewise polynomial representation is a mathematical approximation of the true, continuous physical properties. A discontinuity in $h^\\circ(T)$ or $s^\\circ(T)$ at the switching temperature $T_{\\mid}$ would be unphysical. For example, a jump in $h^\\circ$ would imply an infinite heat capacity ($C_p^\\circ = dh^\\circ/dT$) at that point. From a numerical standpoint, such discontinuities would violate energy and entropy conservation in a simulation time step that crosses $T_{\\mid}$, leading to severe solver failures. Thus, ensuring continuity of $h^\\circ$ and $s^\\circ$ at $T_{\\mid}$ is mandatory.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Require $C_p^\\circ(T)$ to be continuous at $T_{\\mid}$; if $C_p^\\circ$ has any finite jump at $T_{\\mid}$, reject the data for that species.**\n$C_p^\\circ(T)$ is the first derivative of $h^\\circ(T)$ with respect to $T$. While $h^\\circ(T)$ itself must be continuous (C0 continuity), its derivative, $C_p^\\circ(T)$, is not required by any fundamental law to be continuous. In fact, many standard piecewise data representations, such as the widely used 7-coefficient NASA polynomial format, are constructed specifically to enforce continuity in $h^\\circ(T)$ and $s^\\circ(T)$ but explicitly allow for a discontinuity in $C_p^\\circ(T)$ at $T_{\\mid}$. While a smaller jump in $C_p^\\circ(T)$ indicates a better-quality fit, its presence is not a violation of physical principles and is a common feature of such databases. Rejecting data based on this criterion would be overly restrictive and would discard many valid and standard mechanism files.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Enforce the Third Law by requiring $s^\\circ(0)=0$ for all species, using extrapolation of the representation to $T=0$ if needed; if not satisfied, reject the data for that species.**\nThe Third Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystalline substance at absolute zero ($T=0 \\, \\text{K}$) is zero. This principle is fundamental for establishing absolute entropy scales. However, the polynomial representations for thermodynamic properties are empirical fits valid only over a specified temperature range, e.g., $[T_{\\min}, T_{\\max}]$ where $T_{\\min}$ is typically $200 \\, \\text{K}$ or $300 \\, \\text{K}$. These high-temperature polynomials do not accurately describe the quantum-mechanical behavior of heat capacity as $T \\to 0 \\, \\text{K}$. Extrapolating such a polynomial to $T=0 \\, \\text{K}$ is a mathematically and physically invalid procedure. The integration constants used in the polynomial form for $s^\\circ(T)$ are determined to match known entropy values at a reference temperature (like $298.15 \\, \\text{K}$), which themselves have been calculated by integrating experimental low-temperature heat capacity data from (or near) $0 \\, \\text{K}$. Thus, the Third Law is implicitly honored by the data the fit is based on, not by enforcing a condition on the polynomial form outside its domain of validity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. Verify that a single standard-state reference pressure $p^\\circ$ is consistently used across all species and matches the simulation convention (e.g., $p^\\circ=1$ bar); if not, either reconcile or reject the data.**\nWhile the standard-state enthalpy $h^\\circ$ and heat capacity $C_p^\\circ$ of an ideal gas are independent of pressure, the standard-state entropy $s^\\circ$ is not. The entropy of an ideal gas at temperature $T$ and pressure $p$ is related to its standard-state value by $s(T, p) = s^\\circ(T) - R \\ln(p/p^\\circ)$, where $p^\\circ$ is the standard-state pressure ($1 \\, \\text{atm}$ or $1 \\, \\text{bar}$ are common conventions). When calculating thermodynamic properties of a reaction, such as the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction $\\Delta_r G^\\circ = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i^\\circ$, consistency in the standard state is essential. If different species in a mechanism were defined using different values of $p^\\circ$, the resulting reaction thermodynamics and chemical equilibrium calculations would be erroneous. Therefore, it is mandatory to ensure a single, consistent $p^\\circ$ is used for all species.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**G. Require the heat capacity ratio $\\gamma(T)=\\dfrac{C_p^\\circ(T)}{C_v^\\circ(T)}$ to be strictly increasing in $T$ on $[T_{\\min},T_{\\max}]$ for every species; if not, reject the data.**\nFor an ideal gas, Mayer's relation states that $C_p^\\circ(T) - C_v^\\circ(T) = R$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant. We can rewrite the heat capacity ratio $\\gamma(T)$ as:\n$$\n\\gamma(T) = \\frac{C_p^\\circ(T)}{C_v^\\circ(T)} = \\frac{C_p^\\circ(T)}{C_p^\\circ(T) - R} = 1 + \\frac{R}{C_p^\\circ(T) - R}\n$$\nAs temperature increases, vibrational and electronic energy modes become progressively excited, causing $C_p^\\circ(T)$ to increase (or remain constant for a monatomic gas). As $C_p^\\circ(T)$ increases, the denominator $C_p^\\circ(T) - R$ also increases. This causes the fraction $R/(C_p^\\circ(T) - R)$ to decrease. Consequently, $\\gamma(T)$ is generally a non-increasing function of temperature for polyatomic gases in the typical temperature ranges of interest. The proposition that $\\gamma(T)$ must be strictly *increasing* is physically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**H. Cross-validate each species’ tabulated standard enthalpy of formation at $T=298.15$ by computing $h^\\circ(298.15)$ from the imported representation and comparing against the tabulated value within a tight tolerance; if inconsistent, reject the data.**\nThe polynomial representation for $h^\\circ(T)$ is not just a function of temperature; it also contains an integration constant that sets its absolute scale. This constant is chosen so that the value of $h^\\circ(T)$ at a reference temperature (almost universally $T_{ref} = 298.15 \\, \\text{K}$) is equal to the species' standard enthalpy of formation at that temperature, $\\Delta_f H^\\circ(298.15 \\, \\text{K})$. The problem states that there is an independent tabulation of this value. Comparing the value computed from the polynomial, $h^\\circ(298.15)$, against this independently tabulated $\\Delta_f H^\\circ(298.15)$ is a critical check for data consistency. A mismatch indicates an error in the polynomial coefficients or that the data are from two incompatible sources. Since accurate enthalpy of formation is paramount for calculating heats of reaction and ensuring energy conservation, this check is mandatory.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",

You will use the NASA polynomials to find thermodynamic equilibrium and compare it with the kinetic rates, performing the single most important consistency check for any reaction mechanism .",

            "problem": "You are given a small ideal gas reaction mechanism with temperature-dependent standard-state thermodynamic functions for the participating species, represented using the seven-coefficient polynomial form developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). At thermodynamic equilibrium in an ideal gas, the concentration-based equilibrium constant for a reaction is related to the underlying standard-state molar Gibbs free energies and the ideal gas law. Your task is to implement a complete computational procedure that, for multiple reversible reactions and multiple temperatures, verifies the condition for detailed balance in the concentration framework under ideal-gas assumptions by numerically comparing the ratio of forward and reverse rate coefficients to the concentration-based equilibrium constant formed from the prescribed thermodynamic property data. The program must produce boolean results per case using a specified tolerance and must aggregate all results in a single-line output in a specified format.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- For each species, the standard-state dimensionless heat capacity, enthalpy, and entropy are provided as a function of temperature $T$ through the NASA seven-coefficient form. For a given species with coefficients $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6,a_7)$ (valid over the temperature range of interest), the dimensionless functions are:\n$$\n\\frac{c_p(T)}{R} = a_1 + a_2 T + a_3 T^2 + a_4 T^3 + a_5 T^4,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{h(T)}{R T} = a_1 + \\frac{a_2}{2} T + \\frac{a_3}{3} T^2 + \\frac{a_4}{4} T^3 + \\frac{a_5}{5} T^4 + \\frac{a_6}{T},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{s(T)}{R} = a_1 \\ln T + a_2 T + \\frac{a_3}{2} T^2 + \\frac{a_4}{3} T^3 + \\frac{a_5}{4} T^4 + a_7,\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant. The dimensionless Gibbs free energy function is $\\frac{g(T)}{R T} = \\frac{h(T)}{R T} - \\frac{s(T)}{R}$.\n\n- For a reaction with stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_i$ (positive for products, negative for reactants), the standard-state dimensionless Gibbs free energy change is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\left(\\frac{g^\\circ(T)}{R T}\\right) = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\left(\\frac{g_i^\\circ(T)}{R T}\\right),\n$$\nand the pressure-based equilibrium constant (dimensionless, referenced to a standard pressure) obeys:\n$$\nK_p(T) = \\exp\\left(-\\Delta \\left(\\frac{g^\\circ(T)}{R T}\\right)\\right).\n$$\n\n- In the concentration framework under ideal gas assumptions, using the ideal gas law $p = c R T$ and a standard-state pressure $p^\\circ$, the concentration-based equilibrium constant is related to the pressure-based constant through the change in the number of moles $\\Delta \\nu = \\sum_i \\nu_i$:\n$$\nK_c(T) = K_p(T) \\left(\\frac{p^\\circ}{R T}\\right)^{\\Delta \\nu}.\n$$\n\n- Reaction rate coefficients follow the Arrhenius law $k(T) = A \\, T^\\beta \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T}\\right)$ with appropriate units depending on reaction molecularity. For ideal-gas mass-action kinetics, the forward rate coefficient for an $n$-molecule elementary reaction has units consistent with concentration-based rate laws such that the ratio $\\frac{k_f(T)}{k_r(T)}$ has the same units as $K_c(T)$.\n\nYour program must implement the following procedure:\n1. Compute the dimensionless Gibbs free energy $\\frac{g^\\circ(T)}{R T}$ for each species using the provided NASA coefficients at each specified temperature.\n2. For each reaction, compute $\\Delta \\left(\\frac{g^\\circ(T)}{R T}\\right)$ and then $K_p(T)$ for each temperature.\n3. Convert $K_p(T)$ to $K_c(T)$ using the ideal-gas relation and the specified standard-state pressure.\n4. For each reversible reaction at each temperature, compute $\\frac{k_f(T)}{k_r(T)}$ from the given Arrhenius parameters, and compare it numerically with $K_c(T)$ using a specified relative tolerance. For reactions marked as “reverse computed from equilibrium,” use the forward rate coefficient together with the computed $K_c(T)$ to determine the reverse rate coefficient and then check the ratio as above.\n5. Output a single line containing the boolean results for all specified cases, in the exact order given by the test suite, formatted as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example, “[$\\text{True}$,$\\text{False}$]”.\n\nPhysical and numerical units and constants:\n- Use the International System of Units (SI). Temperatures are in kelvin (K), pressure in pascal (Pa), energy in joule (J), time in second (s), and amount in mole (mol). The concentration unit is mole per cubic meter (mol/m$^3$).\n- Use the universal gas constant $R = 8.314462618$ J/(mol·K).\n- Use the standard-state pressure $p^\\circ = 10^5$ Pa.\n- For bimolecular reactions, the forward rate coefficient $k_f(T)$ must be in units of m$^3$/mol·s, and for unimolecular reactions, in s$^{-1}$. The reverse coefficient must use the corresponding units consistent with the reaction molecularity to make $\\frac{k_f(T)}{k_r(T)}$ commensurate with $K_c(T)$.\n- Use a relative tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-7}$, meaning the check passes if $\\left|\\frac{(k_f/k_r)}{K_c} - 1\\right| \\le \\tau$.\n\nSpecies and thermodynamic data:\nFour abstract ideal-gas species are defined with NASA seven-coefficient polynomials valid over the temperature ranges in this problem.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed exercise in computational chemical kinetics and thermodynamics. It requires the numerical verification of the principle of detailed balance for a given set of ideal gas reactions. The problem provides all necessary data, including species' thermodynamic properties via NASA 7-coefficient polynomials and reaction kinetic parameters in Arrhenius form. The procedure is scientifically grounded, free of contradictions, and requires direct application of fundamental principles.\n\nThe solution is implemented by following a systematic, step-by-step computational procedure rooted in the principles of physical chemistry.\n\nFirst, we establish the thermodynamic state of each species at a given temperature $T$. The standard-state thermodynamic functions are provided in the form of NASA 7-coefficient polynomials $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7)$. The dimensionless standard-state enthalpy $\\frac{h^\\circ(T)}{RT}$ and entropy $\\frac{s^\\circ(T)}{R}$ are calculated using the prescribed formulas:\n$$\n\\frac{h^\\circ(T)}{RT} = a_1 + \\frac{a_2}{2} T + \\frac{a_3}{3} T^2 + \\frac{a_4}{4} T^3 + \\frac{a_5}{5} T^4 + \\frac{a_6}{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{s^\\circ(T)}{R} = a_1 \\ln T + a_2 T + \\frac{a_3}{2} T^2 + \\frac{a_4}{3} T^3 + \\frac{a_5}{4} T^4 + a_7\n$$\nFrom these, the dimensionless standard-state Gibbs free energy for each species $i$, $\\frac{g_i^\\circ(T)}{RT}$, is obtained from its fundamental definition:\n$$\n\\frac{g_i^\\circ(T)}{RT} = \\frac{h_i^\\circ(T)}{RT} - \\frac{s_i^\\circ(T)}{R}\n$$\nSince the provided coefficients $a_2$ through $a_5$ are zero for all species, these formulas simplify to:\n$$\n\\frac{h_i^\\circ(T)}{RT} = a_{1,i} + \\frac{a_{6,i}}{T}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{s_i^\\circ(T)}{R} = a_{1,i} \\ln T + a_{7,i}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{g_i^\\circ(T)}{RT} = a_{1,i}\\left(1 - \\ln T\\right) + \\frac{a_{6,i}}{T} - a_{7,i}\n$$\n\nSecond, for each reaction at temperature $T$, we compute the standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction, $\\Delta_r g^\\circ(T)$. This is accomplished by summing the standard Gibbs free energies of the products and subtracting those of the reactants, weighted by their respective stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_i$ (positive for products, negative for reactants):\n$$\n\\Delta\\left(\\frac{g^\\circ(T)}{RT}\\right) = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\left(\\frac{g_i^\\circ(T)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThis quantity directly determines the thermodynamic equilibrium position of the reaction.\n\nThird, we calculate the equilibrium constant. The dimensionless, pressure-based equilibrium constant, $K_p(T)$, is related to the standard Gibbs free energy change by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\nK_p(T) = \\exp\\left(-\\Delta\\left(\\frac{g^\\circ(T)}{RT}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSince reaction rates are expressed in terms of concentrations, we must convert $K_p(T)$ to the concentration-based equilibrium constant, $K_c(T)$. For an ideal gas mixture, this conversion depends on the change in the number of moles for the reaction, $\\Delta \\nu = \\sum_i \\nu_i$, the universal gas constant $R$, temperature $T$, and the standard-state pressure $p^\\circ$:\n$$\nK_c(T) = K_p(T) \\left(\\frac{p^\\circ}{RT}\\right)^{\\Delta\\nu}\n$$\nThe units of $K_c(T)$ will be (moles/volume)$^{\\Delta\\nu}$.\n\nFourth, we determine the forward and reverse reaction rate coefficients, $k_f(T)$ and $k_r(T)$. These are calculated using the provided Arrhenius parameters $(A, \\beta, E_a)$ and the relation:\n$$\nk(T) = A T^\\beta \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nFor Reaction $\\mathrm{R1}$, the reverse rate is specified as being \"computed from equilibrium\". In this case, $k_r(T)$ is not determined from independent Arrhenius parameters but is instead defined by invoking the principle of detailed balance itself: $k_r(T) = k_f(T) / K_c(T)$. For Reactions $\\mathrm{R2}$ and $\\mathrm{R3}$, both $k_f(T)$ and $k_r(T)$ are computed from their independent, specified Arrhenius parameters.\n\nFinally, we perform the numerical verification. The core of the task is to check if the ratio of kinetic rate coefficients equals the thermodynamically derived equilibrium constant. We compute the ratio $\\frac{k_f(T)}{k_r(T)}$ and compare it to $K_c(T)$. The check passes if the relative difference is within a specified tolerance $\\tau = 10^{-7}$:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{k_f(T)/k_r(T)}{K_c(T)} - 1 \\right| \\le \\tau\n$$\nFor Reaction $\\mathrm{R1}$, where $k_r(T)$ is defined to satisfy this relation, the check becomes a test of the numerical self-consistency of the implementation, and the expected outcome is `True`. For Reactions $\\mathrm{R2}$ and $\\mathrm{R3}$, this check is a non-trivial test of the consistency between the provided kinetic and thermodynamic data.\n\nThis entire procedure is applied to each reaction and temperature combination specified in the test suite. The resulting boolean outcomes are collected and printed in the specified format. The implementation uses the provided high-precision value for the universal gas constant $R = 8.314462618$ J/(mol·K) and standard pressure $p^\\circ = 10^5$ Pa.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the thermodynamic consistency problem by verifying detailed balance\n    for a set of chemical reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Physical and numerical constants\n    R = 8.314462618  # Universal gas constant in J/(mol·K)\n    P_STD = 1e5    # Standard-state pressure in Pa\n    TOLERANCE = 1e-7 # Relative tolerance for the check\n\n    # Species thermodynamic data (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7)\n    SPECIES_DATA = {\n        'A': (3.5, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -10000.0, 5.0),\n        'B': (3.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -8000.0, 4.0),\n        'C': (4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -18000.0, 6.0),\n        'D': (3.2, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -12000.0, 4.5),\n    }\n\n    # Reaction mechanism and kinetics data\n    REACTIONS = {\n        'R1': {\n            'stoich': {'A': -1, 'B': -1, 'C': 1},\n            'fwd_kinetics': (2.0e3, 0.5, 2.0e4),\n            'rev_kinetics': 'equilibrium'\n        },\n        'R2': {\n            'stoich': {'A': -1, 'B': -1, 'C': 1},\n            'fwd_kinetics': (2.0e3, 0.5, 2.0e4),\n            'rev_kinetics': (5.0, 0.0, 1.0e4)\n        },\n        'R3': {\n            'stoich': {'A': -1, 'D': 1},\n            'fwd_kinetics': (1.0e1, 0.0, 5.0e4),\n            'rev_kinetics': (2.0e1, 0.0, 3.0e4)\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Test suite to be evaluated\n    TEST_CASES = [\n        ('R1', 800.0),\n        ('R1', 1500.0),\n        ('R1', 2500.0),\n        ('R2', 800.0),\n        ('R2', 2500.0),\n        ('R3', 1000.0),\n        ('R3', 2000.0),\n    ]\n\n    def g_over_rt(coeffs, T):\n        \"\"\"Computes dimensionless Gibbs free energy g/RT for a species.\"\"\"\n        a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 = coeffs\n        h_over_rt = (a1 + a2/2*T + a3/3*T**2 + a4/4*T**3 + a5/5*T**4 + a6/T)\n        s_over_r = (a1*np.log(T) + a2*T + a3/2*T**2 + a4/3*T**3 + a5/4*T**4 + a7)\n        return h_over_rt - s_over_r\n\n    def k_arrhenius(params, T):\n        \"\"\"Computes Arrhenius rate coefficient.\"\"\"\n        A, beta, Ea = params\n        return A * (T**beta) * np.exp(-Ea / (R * T))\n\n    results = []\n    for reaction_id, T in TEST_CASES:\n        reaction = REACTIONS[reaction_id]\n        stoich = reaction['stoich']\n\n        # 1. & 2.
