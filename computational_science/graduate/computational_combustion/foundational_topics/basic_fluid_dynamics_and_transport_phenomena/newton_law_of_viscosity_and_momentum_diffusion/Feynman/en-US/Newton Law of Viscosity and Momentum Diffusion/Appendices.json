However, in reacting flows, large temperature gradients often make the assumption of constant viscosity untenable.

The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe starting point is the steady-state $x$-momentum equation for a one-dimensional shear flow, $u=u(y)$, with constant density and no pressure gradient. For fully developed flow, the convective acceleration terms are zero. The momentum equation reduces to a balance between viscous forces:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\tau_{xy}\\right) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{xy}$ is the shear stress. This equation implies that the shear stress is constant across the gap:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy}(y) = \\text{constant} = C_{1}\n$$\nThis constant shear stress is equal to the stress at the wall, so we can set $C_{1} = \\tau_{w}$, where $\\tau_{w} = \\tau_{xy}(y=0)$.\n\nNewton's law of viscosity states:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy} = \\mu(y) \\frac{du}{dy}\n$$\nCombining these, we get:\n$$\n\\mu(y) \\frac{du}{dy} = \\tau_{w}\n$$\nThe viscosity $\\mu$ is a function of temperature $T$, and temperature is a function of position $y$. We first express $\\mu$ as an explicit function of $y$:\n$$\nT(y) = T_{0} + \\Delta T \\frac{y}{h} = T_{0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the viscosity law:\n$$\n\\mu(y) = \\mu_{0}\\left(\\frac{T(y)}{T_{0}}\\right)^{n} = \\mu_{0}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}\\right)^{n}\n$$\nNow, we can write the differential equation for the velocity profile $u(y)$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\mu(y)} = \\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\mu_{0}}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}\\right)^{-n}\n$$\nTo find the velocity profile $u(y)$, we integrate this expression with respect to $y$:\n$$\nu(y) = \\int \\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\mu_{0}}\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}\\right)^{-n} dy\n$$\nLet the variable of integration be $z = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\frac{y}{h}$. Then $dz = \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}h} dy$, so $dy = \\frac{T_{0}h}{\\Delta T} dz$.\nThe integration yields:\n$$\nu(y) = \\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\mu_{0}} \\int z^{-n} \\left(\\frac{T_{0}h}{\\Delta T}\\right) dz = \\frac{\\tau_{w}T_{0}h}{\\mu_{0}\\Delta T} \\frac{z^{1-n}}{1-n} + C_{2}\n$$\nThis integration is valid because the problem specifies $n \\neq 1$.

The request to express the answer in Pascals (Pa) is a confirmation of the physical quantity, as the derived expression is dimensionally consistent with stress (Force/Area) if SI units are used for all input parameters.\n\nFinally, we verify the result in the limit $n \\to 0$. This limit corresponds to a constant viscosity $\\mu = \\mu_0$.\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to 0} \\tau_{w} = \\lim_{n\\to 0} \\frac{\\mu_{0} U (1-n) \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}}{h \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{1-n} - 1 \\right]} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} U (1) \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}}{h \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{1} - 1 \\right]}\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to 0} \\tau_{w} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} U \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}}{h \\left( \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}} \\right)} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} U}{h}\n$$\nThis is precisely the well-known shear stress for classical planar Couette flow with constant viscosity $\\mu_{0}$, thus verifying the derived expression.\nThe velocity profile $u(y)$ can also be expressed by substituting $\\tau_w$ into its equation:\n$$\nu(y) = U \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}\\frac{y}{h}\\right)^{1-n} - 1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{1-n} - 1}\n$$\nThis expression satisfies $u(0)=0$ and $u(h)=U$, as required.

Newton’s law of viscosity states that the shear stress is proportional to the velocity gradient, $\\tau = \\mu \\, \\partial u / \\partial x$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. For constant density $\\rho$ and constant $\\mu$, the momentum equation reduces to the linear diffusion equation $\\partial u / \\partial t = \\nu \\, \\partial^{2} u / \\partial x^{2}$, where $\\nu = \\mu / \\rho$ is the kinematic viscosity.

Using Fourier (von Neumann) mode reasoning that starts from the physical diffusion model above, compare these three spatial discretizations with respect to their dispersion and dissipation characteristics and their implications for explicit time-step stability.

For constant $\\nu$, the semi-discrete diffusion operators produced by the second-order central difference, the fourth-order tridiagonal compact scheme, and the Fourier spectral method on a uniform periodic grid have real, nonpositive eigenvalues for all discrete Fourier modes.

For explicit forward Euler time integration of the semi-discrete diffusion equation on a periodic grid of spacing $\\Delta x$, the maximum stable time step for the second-order central-difference Laplacian is $\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\Delta x^{2} / (2 \\nu)$, and for the Fourier spectral second derivative it is $\\Delta t_{\\max} = 2 \\Delta x^{2} / (\\nu \\pi^{2})$.

The Fourier spectral discretization of the viscous term yields exact decay rates $\\exp(-\\nu k^{2} t)$ for all grid-resolved Fourier modes with wavenumber $k$ below the Nyquist limit, whereas the second-order central differencing underestimates the decay rate for higher wavenumbers relative to the exact $k^{2}$, leading to less damping of under-resolved gradients compared to the spectral method.\n\nD.

The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and uses precise, objective language. The concepts of momentum diffusion, Newton's law of viscosity, and the comparison of standard numerical discretization schemes (finite difference, compact finite difference, spectral) are fundamental topics in computational fluid dynamics. The analysis requested, based on Fourier (von Neumann) stability and accuracy theory, is the standard approach for such problems. Therefore, the problem statement is valid.\n\nThe core of the problem is the analysis of the semi-discrete equation $\\partial u / \\partial t = \\nu \\mathcal{L}(u)$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is a discrete approximation of the second spatial derivative $\\partial^2 / \\partial x^2$. We use Fourier analysis by considering the action of the discrete operator on a single mode $u_j(t) = \\hat{u}(t) e^{i k x_j}$, where $x_j = j \\Delta x$. The continuous operator transforms this mode as $\\partial^2 (e^{ikx}) / \\partial x^2 = (ik)^2 e^{ikx} = -k^2 e^{ikx}$.

We often analyze $\\lambda_k$ in terms of an effective squared wavenumber, $-k_{eff}^2$.\n\nIf $\\nu \\lambda_k$ is purely real and non-positive, the scheme is purely dissipative and introduces no numerical dispersion. The accuracy of the dissipation is determined by how well $-\\nu k_{eff}^2$ approximates the exact value $-\\nu k^2$. For explicit forward Euler time integration, $u^{n+1} = u^n + \\Delta t (\\nu \\mathcal{L}(u^n))$, stability requires $|1 + \\nu \\Delta t \\lambda_k| \\le 1$ for all relevant wavenumbers $k$. Since $\\lambda_k$ will be shown to be real and non-positive for all schemes, this simplifies to $\\nu \\Delta t (-\\lambda_k) \\le 2$.

Applying this to $u_j = e^{ikj\\Delta x}$:\n    $$ \\mathcal{L}(e^{ikj\\Delta x}) = \\frac{e^{ik(j+1)\\Delta x} - 2e^{ikj\\Delta x} + e^{ik(j-1)\\Delta x}}{\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{e^{ikj\\Delta x}(e^{ik\\Delta x} - 2 + e^{-ik\\Delta x})}{\\Delta x^2} $$\n    $$ = \\frac{2(\\cos(k\\Delta x) - 1)}{\\Delta x^2} e^{ikj\\Delta x} = -\\frac{4\\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)}{\\Delta x^2} e^{ikj\\Delta x} $$\n    The eigenvalue is $\\lambda_k = -4\\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2) / \\Delta x^2$, which is real and non-positive.\n\n2.  **Fourth-order tridiagonal compact scheme**: A standard scheme has the form $\\alpha f_{j-1} + f_j + \\alpha f_{j+1} = a \\frac{u_{j+1}-2u_j+u_{j-1}}{\\Delta x^2}$, where $f_j$ is the discrete second derivative. For $f_j = \\lambda_k u_j$ and $u_j = e^{ikj\\Delta x}$, we get $\\lambda_k (\\alpha e^{-ik\\Delta x} + 1 + \\alpha e^{ik\\Delta x}) = a \\frac{e^{ik\\Delta x} - 2 + e^{-ik\\Delta x}}{\\Delta x^2}$.\n    $$ \\lambda_k (1 + 2\\alpha\\cos(k\\Delta x)) = \\frac{2a(\\cos(k\\Delta x) - 1)}{\\Delta x^2} \\implies \\lambda_k = \\frac{-4a\\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)}{\\Delta x^2(1 + 2\\alpha\\cos(k\\Delta x))} $$\n    For any valid coefficients (e.g., $\\alpha=1/10, a=6/5$), $\\mu > 0$, and since $1+2\\alpha\\cos\\theta$ is positive for typical schemes, $\\lambda_k$ is real and non-positive.\n\n3.  **Fourier spectral method**: This method computes the derivative exactly in Fourier space. The operator corresponds to multiplication by $(ik)^2 = -k^2$ for each wavenumber $k$ up to the Nyquist limit. The eigenvalue is $\\lambda_k = -k^2$, which is real and non-positive.\n\nSince for all three schemes the eigenvalues $\\nu \\lambda_k$ (for real $\\nu$) are purely real, there is no imaginary part to the growth rate $d(\\ln \\hat{u})/dt$. An imaginary part would correspond to a phase speed, so its absence means there is no numerical dispersion. The decay rate is the real part, $\\nu \\lambda_k$, where $\\lambda_k$ is the symbol. The statement is entirely correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThis statement compares the maximum stable time steps for the $2$nd-order central difference and the Fourier spectral method.\n\n1.  **Second-order central difference**: The stability condition is $\\nu \\Delta t (-\\lambda_k) \\le 2$. We need the maximum of $-\\lambda_k = 4\\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2) / \\Delta x^2$. This occurs at the highest wavenumber, $k = \\pi/\\Delta x$, where $k\\Delta x/2 = \\pi/2$.\n    $$ (-\\lambda_k)_{max} = \\frac{4\\sin^2(\\pi/2)}{\\Delta x^2} = \\frac{4}{\\Delta x^2} $$\n    Thus, $\\nu \\Delta t (4/\\Delta x^2) \\le 2 \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{2\\Delta x^2}{4\\nu} = \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2\\nu}$. This formula is correct.\n\n2.  **Fourier spectral method**: The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_k = -k^2$. The maximum magnitude is at the Nyquist limit, $k_{max} = \\pi/\\Delta x$.\n    $$ (-\\lambda_k)_{max} = k_{max}^2 = (\\pi/\\Delta x)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{\\Delta x^2} $$\n    Thus, $\\nu \\Delta t (\\pi^2/\\Delta x^2) \\le 2 \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{2\\Delta x^2}{\\nu\\pi^2}$. This formula is also correct.\n\n3.  **Comparison**: The statement claims the spectral method permits a larger time step. Let's compare the two maximum step sizes:\n    $$ \\Delta t_{max, CD2} = \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2\\nu} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta t_{max, Spec} = \\frac{2\\Delta x^2}{\\nu\\pi^2} $$\n    Since $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.87$, we have $1/2 = 0.5$ and $2/\\pi^2 \\approx 2/9.87 \\approx 0.2026$.\n    Since $0.2026  0.5$, we have $\\Delta t_{max, Spec}  \\Delta t_{max, CD2}$. The spectral method has a much more restrictive time step limit. The conclusion of the statement is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThis statement compares the decay rates of the Fourier spectral method and the $2$nd-order central differencing.\n\n1.  **Fourier spectral method**: As established, the semi-discrete equation for a mode is $\\frac{d\\hat{u}_k}{dt} = -\\nu k^2 \\hat{u}_k$. The solution is $\\hat{u}_k(t) = \\hat{u}_k(0) e^{-\\nu k^2 t}$. This means the decay rate is exact for all grid-resolved modes. This part of the statement is correct.\n\n2.  **Second-order central differencing**: The decay is governed by the exponent $-\\nu k_{eff}^2 t$, where $k_{eff}^2 = 4\\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2) / \\Delta x^2$. We must compare this to the exact $k^2$. Let $\\theta = k\\Delta x$. We compare $\\frac{4\\sin^2(\\theta/2)}{\\Delta x^2}$ with $\\frac{\\theta^2}{\\Delta x^2}$. This is equivalent to comparing $2|\\sin(\\theta/2)|$ with $|\\theta|$. The well-known inequality $|\\sin(x)| \\le |x|$ (with equality only at $x=0$) shows that $2|\\sin(\\theta/2)| \\le |\\theta|$. Therefore, $k_{eff}^2 \\le k^2$. The inequality is more pronounced for larger $\\theta$, i.e., for higher wavenumbers. This means the scheme underestimates the true dissipation, especially for high-wavenumber components, which represent sharp gradients.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: \"leading to less damping of under-resolved gradients compared to the spectral method.\" This is correct. The spectral method applies the exact damping, while the $2$nd-order scheme applies insufficient damping to high-wavenumber content.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThis statement assesses a $4$th-order compact scheme regarding its dispersion and dissipation error.\n\n1.  **Dispersion error**: \"vanishing phase speed error at all wavenumbers\". As shown in the analysis of option A, the eigenvalues are purely real. This means the scheme is purely dissipative for the diffusion problem and introduces no dispersion (phase error). This part is correct.\n\n2.  **Amplitude error**: This refers to the error in the decay rate, comparing the numerical dissipation $\\nu k_{eff}^2$ to the exact $\\nu k^2$.\n    *   For the $2$nd-order scheme, the Taylor series expansion is $k_{eff,2}^2 = \\frac{4}{\\Delta x^2}(\\frac{k\\Delta x}{2} - \\frac{(k\\Delta x)^3}{48} + \\dots)^2 = k^2 - \\frac{k^4\\Delta x^2}{12} + O(k^6)$. The leading error term is of order $k^4$.\n    *   For the $4$th-order compact scheme, it is designed such that the error is of a higher order. By construction (matching Taylor series coefficients), $k_{eff,4}^2 = k^2 + C k^6 \\Delta x^4 + \\dots$ for some constant $C$ (which can be shown to be $1/360$). The leading error term is of order $k^6$.\n    *   For low wavenumbers ($k\\Delta x \\ll 1$), an error term proportional to $k^6$ is much smaller than an error term proportional to $k^4$. The statement claims the amplitude error of the $4$th-order scheme \"exceeds that of the second-order central difference for low wavenumbers\". This is false. The $4$th-order scheme is significantly more accurate for low wavenumbers.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Option E:**\nThis statement analyzes a variable viscosity case, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (\\mu(x) \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x})$, discretized using central differences.\n\n1.  **Discretization and Operator Symmetry**: The variable-coefficient diffusion term $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x})$ is discretized at node $j$ as $\\frac{1}{\\Delta x} [ (\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x})_{j+1/2} - (\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x})_{j-1/2} ]$. Using central differences for the gradients at the faces gives:\n    $$ \\mathcal{L}(u)_j = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2} [ \\mu_{j+1/2}(u_{j+1}-u_j) - \\mu_{j-1/2}(u_j - u_{j-1}) ] $$\n    $$ = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2} [ \\mu_{j-1/2} u_{j-1} - (\\mu_{j-1/2} + \\mu_{j+1/2}) u_j + \\mu_{j+1/2} u_{j+1} ] $$\n    The corresponding operator matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ has elements $L_{j,j-1} = \\mu_{j-1/2}/\\Delta x^2$, $L_{j,j+1} = \\mu_{j+1/2}/\\Delta x^2$, and $L_{j+1,j} = \\mu_{j+1-1/2}/\\Delta x^2 = \\mu_{j+1/2}/\\Delta x^2$. Since $L_{j, j+1} = L_{j+1, j}$, the matrix is symmetric. The use of arithmetic averaging for $\\mu$ at the faces, $\\mu_{j+1/2} = (\\mu_j+\\mu_{j+1})/2$, ensures $\\mu>0$ if the nodal values are positive.\n\n2.  **Negative-definiteness**: To check if the operator is negative-definite, we compute the quadratic form $\\vec{v}^T \\mathbf{L} \\vec{v}$ for an arbitrary vector $\\vec{v}$:\n    $$ \\vec{v}^T \\mathbf{L} \\vec{v} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2} \\sum_j v_j [ \\mu_{j-1/2} v_{j-1} - (\\mu_{j-1/2} + \\mu_{j+1/2}) v_j + \\mu_{j+1/2} v_{j+1} ] $$\n    After re-arranging the sum and collecting terms by faces, this simplifies to:\n    $$ \\vec{v}^T \\mathbf{L} \\vec{v} = -\\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2} \\sum_j \\mu_{j+1/2} (v_{j+1} - v_j)^2 $$\n    Since viscosity $\\mu(x)>0$, $\\mu_{j+1/2} > 0$. The squared term is non-negative. Thus, $\\vec{v}^T \\mathbf{L} \\vec{v} \\le 0$. It is zero only if $v_{j+1}=v_j$ for all $j$, i.e., for a constant vector. On the space orthogonal to the constant vectors, the operator is negative-definite. So the statement that the operator is symmetric negative-definite is correct in the standard sense used in numerical analysis.\n\n3.  **Kinetic Energy**: The discrete kinetic energy is proportional to $E = ||\\vec{u}||_2^2 = \\sum_j u_j^2$. Its time evolution under the semi-discrete system $\\frac{d\\vec{u}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\mathbf{L}\\vec{u}$ is:\n    $$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} (\\vec{u}^T\\vec{u}) = 2\\vec{u}^T \\frac{d\\vec{u}}{dt} = \\frac{2}{\\rho} \\vec{u}^T \\mathbf{L} \\vec{u} \\le 0 $$\n    This shows that the discrete kinetic energy is non-increasing for the semi-discrete system. For the fully discrete forward Euler step $\\vec{u}^{n+1} = (\\mathbf{I} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\mathbf{L})\\vec{u}^n$, the energy $||\\vec{u}^{n+1}||_2^2$ will be non-increasing if the spectral radius of the amplification matrix $\\mathbf{G} = \\mathbf{I} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\mathbf{L}$ is at most $1$. Since $\\mathbf{G}$ is symmetric, this is equivalent to its eigenvalues being in $[-1, 1]$. Since $\\mathbf{L}$ is symmetric negative semi-definite (eigenvalues $\\lambda_i \\le 0$), the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}$ are $1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\lambda_i \\le 1$. The condition $1 + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\lambda_i \\ge -1$ is precisely the diffusion stability limit. If this limit is respected, energy is non-increasing. The statement is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.",
