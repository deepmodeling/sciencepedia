            "problem": "You are tasked with deriving and implementing a computational model for the binary diffusion coefficient of a dilute reacting gas mixture using principles from kinetic theory of gases and the Chapman–Enskog expansion. Specifically, consider the pair of species hydrogen $\\mathrm{H_2}$ and nitrogen $\\mathrm{N_2}$, each characterized by Lennard–Jones parameters: collision diameter $\\sigma$ (in Ångström) and well depth divided by the Boltzmann constant $\\epsilon/k_B$ (in Kelvin). Using physically plausible values, let the tabulated parameters be $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 2.827$ Å, $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 38.0$ K, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 3.621$ Å, and $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 97.0$ K. Adopt the standard combining rules for binary interaction: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}} = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{N_2}})/2$ and $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}} = \\sqrt{(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\cdot (\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{N_2}}}$. Let the molar masses be $M_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 2.01588$ g/mol and $M_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 28.0134$ g/mol.\n\nStarting from a valid theoretical base, namely the Maxwell–Stefan description of multicomponent diffusion specialized to a binary dilute gas and the Chapman–Enskog first-order expression for the binary diffusion coefficient with a Lennard–Jones $12$-$6$ potential, derive the expression for the binary diffusion coefficient $D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}(T,p)$ as a function of absolute temperature $T$ (in Kelvin) and pressure $p$ (in Pascal). Your derivation must be based on definitions and well-tested facts, such as the Boltzmann constant $k_B$, Avogadro’s number $N_A$, reduced mass, and the temperature-dependent collision integral for diffusion. Do not use any pre-supplied shortcut formulas; instead, derive the computationally implementable expression from first principles within this framework and specify any necessary dimensional conversions to ensure $D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}$ is returned in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n\nFor the diffusion collision integral $\\Omega_D$ of the Lennard–Jones $12$-$6$ potential, let $\\Omega_D$ be a function of the reduced temperature $T^\\star = T / ((\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}})$, and in the reference implementation assume the standard fit used by CHEMKIN (CHEMical KINetics software package). For comparison purposes, also implement a simplified approximation for $\\Omega_D$ keeping only the leading inverse-power term and omitting the exponential correction terms. Use both the full fit and the simplified approximation to compute two values for $D_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}(T,p)$ and form their ratio to quantify the deviation of the approximation from the CHEMKIN-style reference.\n\nPhysical units requirement: Express all final diffusion coefficients in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$. Pressures in inputs are given in Pascal; any internal conversions to other units (for example, atmospheres) must be handled explicitly and consistently.\n\nAngle units are not applicable in this problem.\n\nYour program must evaluate the following test suite of $(T,p)$ values:\n- Test case 1 (happy path): $T = 300.0$ K, $p = 101325.0$ Pa.\n- Test case 2 (elevated temperature): $T = 1000.0$ K, $p = 101325.0$ Pa.\n- Test case 3 (elevated temperature and pressure): $T = 1000.0$ K, $p = 10 \\times 101325.0$ Pa.\n- Test case 4 (high temperature, sub-atmospheric pressure): $T = 2500.0$ K, $p = 0.5 \\times 101325.0$ Pa.\n- Test case 5 (low pressure edge case): $T = 400.0$ K, $p = 1000.0$ Pa.\n\nFor each test case, compute the ratio $R = D_{\\mathrm{approx}}(T,p)/D_{\\mathrm{CHEMKIN}}(T,p)$, where $D_{\\mathrm{approx}}$ uses the simplified approximation for the diffusion collision integral and $D_{\\mathrm{CHEMKIN}}$ uses the full CHEMKIN-style fit for the diffusion collision integral. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the ratios as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, \"[r1,r2,r3,r4,r5]\"), with each $r_i$ a decimal floating-point number.",

The Chapman–Enskog theory, Lennard-Jones potential, and associated concepts are standard and scientifically sound. The provided physical parameters are realistic.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem specifies all necessary inputs, physical models (or references to standard models, e.g., \"CHEMKIN-style fit\"), and a clearly defined objective.

However, this is a standard, widely published model in the field of combustion and transport phenomena, and it is reasonable to expect a practitioner in this domain to know or be able to reference it. This is considered expected domain knowledge, not a flaw of incompleteness. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Algorithmic Design\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the ratio $R = D_{\\mathrm{approx}}/D_{\\mathrm{CHEMKIN}}$. We begin by deriving the expression for the binary diffusion coefficient, $D_{ij}$, for a pair of species $i$ and $j$.\n\n**2.1. Fundamental Expression for Binary Diffusion Coefficient**\nFrom the first-order Chapman–Enskog theory for a dilute gas mixture interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential, the binary diffusion coefficient $D_{ij}$ is given by:\n$$\nD_{ij} = \\frac{3}{16} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 \\pi k_B^3 T^3 / \\mu_{ij}}}{p \\pi \\sigma_{ij}^2 \\Omega_D(T_{ij}^*)}\n$$\nTo ensure the output $D_{ij}$ is in SI units ($\\mathrm{m^2/s}$), all input quantities must be in base SI units:\n- $k_B$: Boltzmann constant ($1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K)\n- $T$: Absolute temperature in Kelvin (K)\n- $p$: Absolute pressure in Pascal (Pa)\n- $\\mu_{ij}$: Reduced mass of the interacting pair in kilograms (kg)\n- $\\sigma_{ij}$: Collision diameter for the pair in meters (m)\n- $\\Omega_D$: The dimensionless diffusion collision integral, which is a function of the reduced temperature $T_{ij}^*$.\n\n**2.2. Calculation of Interaction Parameters**\nThe parameters for the binary interaction between species $i$ and $j$ are calculated from the pure-species parameters using the specified combining rules:\n- **Collision Diameter**: $\\sigma_{ij} = (\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j)/2$\n- **Well Depth Parameter**: $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{ij} = \\sqrt{(\\epsilon/k_B)_i \\cdot (\\epsilon/k_B)_j}$\n\nThe required species parameters, converted to SI units, are:\n- $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 2.827 \\times 10^{-10}$ m\n- $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 38.0$ K\n- $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 3.621 \\times 10^{-10}$ m\n- $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 97.0$ K\n\nThis yields the binary interaction parameters for the H₂-N₂ pair:\n- $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}} = (2.827 + 3.621)/2 \\times 10^{-10} = 3.224 \\times 10^{-10}$ m\n- $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}} = \\sqrt{38.0 \\cdot 97.0} = \\sqrt{3686} \\approx 60.712$ K\n\n**2.3. Reduced Mass and Reduced Temperature**\n- The **reduced mass** $\\mu_{ij}$ is defined as $\\mu_{ij} = (m_i m_j) / (m_i + m_j)$, where $m_i$ is the mass of a single molecule, calculated from the molar mass $M_i$ and Avogadro's number $N_A$ ($6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}$ mol⁻¹), i.e., $m_i = M_i / N_A$.\n- The **reduced temperature** $T_{ij}^*$ is a dimensionless quantity defined as $T_{ij}^* = T / (\\epsilon/k_B)_{ij}$.\n\n**2.4. Collision Integral Models**\nThe diffusion collision integral $\\Omega_D$ corrects the rigid-sphere model for the true nature of intermolecular forces. We will implement two models for $\\Omega_D(T_{ij}^*)$.\n\n- **CHEMKIN-style Fit ($\\Omega_{D, \\text{CHEMKIN}}$)**: This is a standard empirical fit to tabulated values of the collision integral for the Lennard-Jones potential.\n$$\n\\Omega_{D, \\text{CHEMKIN}}(T^*) = \\frac{A}{(T^*)^B} + \\frac{C}{\\exp(D T^*)} + \\frac{E}{\\exp(F T^*)} + \\frac{G}{\\exp(H T^*)}\n$$\nwith the standard coefficients: $A = 1.06036$, $B = 0.15610$, $C = 0.19300$, $D = 0.47635$, $E = 1.03587$, $F = 1.52996$, $G = 1.76474$, $H = 3.89411$.\n\n- **Simplified Approximation ($\\Omega_{D, \\text{approx}}$)**: As per the problem statement, this model retains only the leading inverse-power term of the full fit.\n$$\n\\Omega_{D, \\text{approx}}(T^*) = \\frac{A}{(T^*)^B} = \\frac{1.06036}{(T^*)^{0.15610}}\n$$\n\n**2.5. Derivation of the Ratio $R$**\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R = D_{\\mathrm{approx}}/D_{\\mathrm{CHEMKIN}}$. Let's define a prefactor $C(T, p)$ that contains all terms in the $D_{ij}$ expression except for the collision integral:\n$$\nC(T, p) = \\frac{3}{16} \\frac{\\sqrt{2 \\pi k_B^3 T^3 / \\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}}}{p \\pi \\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}^2}\n$$\nThe diffusion coefficients for the two models can then be written as:\n- $D_{\\mathrm{CHEMKIN}}(T,p) = C(T, p) / \\Omega_{D, \\text{CHEMKIN}}(T_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}^*)$\n- $D_{\\mathrm{approx}}(T,p) = C(T, p) / \\Omega_{D, \\text{approx}}(T_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}^*)$\n\nThe ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$\nR = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{approx}}(T,p)}{D_{\\mathrm{CHEMKIN}}(T,p)} = \\frac{C(T, p) / \\Omega_{D, \\text{approx}}(T_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}^*)}{C(T, p) / \\Omega_{D, \\text{CHEMKIN}}(T_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}^*)}\n$$\nThe prefactor $C(T, p)$ cancels out, leading to a significant simplification:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Omega_{D, \\text{CHEMKIN}}(T_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}^*)}{\\Omega_{D, \\text{approx}}(T_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}^*)}\n$$\nThis result shows that the ratio $R$ depends only on the temperature $T$ (through the reduced temperature $T^*$) and is independent of pressure $p$, collision diameter $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}$, and reduced mass $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}$.\n\n**2.6. Computational Algorithm**\nThe algorithm to compute the required ratios is as follows:\n1. Define the species parameter $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 38.0$ K and $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 97.0$ K.\n2. Calculate the binary interaction parameter $(\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}} = \\sqrt{38.0 \\cdot 97.0}$.\n3. For each test case temperature $T$:\n    a. Calculate the reduced temperature $T^* = T / (\\epsilon/k_B)_{\\mathrm{H_2,N_2}}$.\n    b. Compute $\\Omega_{D, \\text{CHEMKIN}}(T^*)$ using the full fit expression.\n    c. Compute $\\Omega_{D, \\text{approx}}(T^*)$ using the simplified expression.\n    d. Calculate the ratio $R = \\Omega_{D, \\text{CHEMKIN}}(T^*) / \\Omega_{D, \\text{approx}}(T^*)$.\n4.

Derivation of the Lewis Number Expression\nThe Lewis number is defined as the ratio of thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha(T)$, to mass diffusivity, $D_k(T)$:\n$$ Le_k(T) = \\frac{\\alpha(T)}{D_k(T)} $$\nWe are given models for all constituent properties. Let's substitute them step-by-step.\n- The thermal diffusivity is $\\alpha(T) = \\frac{\\lambda(T)}{\\rho(T) c_p(T)}$.\n- The density is given by the ideal gas law: $\\rho(T) = \\frac{p}{R_m T}$.\n\nSubstituting the density into the thermal diffusivity expression:\n$$ \\alpha(T) = \\frac{\\lambda(T)}{\\left(\\frac{p}{R_m T}\\right) c_p(T)} = \\frac{\\lambda(T) R_m T}{p \\, c_p(T)} $$\nNow, we substitute this into the Lewis number definition:\n$$ Le_k(T) = \\frac{1}{D_k(T)} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda(T) R_m T}{p \\, c_p(T)} \\right) $$\nThe problem provides the following temperature-dependent models:\n- Thermal conductivity: $\\lambda(T) = a_\\lambda + b_\\lambda T$\n- Specific heat: $c_p(T) = a_{c_p} + b_{c_p} T$\n- Mass diffusivity: $D_k(T) = D_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{n}\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{p}\\right)$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $Le_k(T)$:\n$$ Le_k(T) = \\frac{1}{D_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{n}\\left(\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{p}\\right)} \\left( \\frac{(a_\\lambda + b_\\lambda T) R_m T}{p (a_{c_p} + b_{c_p} T)} \\right) $$\nWe can simplify and group the terms.

Numerical Implementation and Classification\nThe procedure to solve the problem for each test case is as follows:\n1.  **Discretize the Domain:** Create a uniform spatial grid of $N \\ge 1000$ points, $x_i$, for $x \\in [0, L]$.\n2.  **Calculate Temperature Profile:** For each grid point $x_i$, compute the local temperature $T(x_i)$ using the given hyperbolic tangent profile:\n    $$ T(x_i) = T_u + \\frac{T_b - T_u}{2}\\left[1 + \\tanh\\left(\\frac{x_i - x_0}{\\delta}\\right)\\right] $$\n3.  **Calculate Lewis Number Profile:** For each temperature value $T(x_i)$, calculate the corresponding local Lewis number $Le_k(T(x_i))$ using the derived expression. This yields a profile $Le_k(x_i)$.\n4.  **Compute Classification Metrics:**\n    *   **Average Lewis Number ($\\overline{Le}_k$):** Compute the numerical average of the $Le_k(x_i)$ values over the grid. Since the grid is uniform, this approximates the spatial integral:\n        $$ \\overline{Le}_k \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Le_k(x_i) $$\n    *   **Minimum Lewis Number ($Le_{k,\\min}$):** Find the minimum value in the calculated $Le_k(x_i)$ profile.\n    *   **Fraction Below Unity ($\\phi_{1}$):** Count the number of grid points $N_{1}$ where $Le_k(x_i)  1$ and divide by the total number of points $N$.\n        $$ \\phi_{1} = \\frac{N_{1}}{N} $$\n5.  **Apply Classification Rule:** Use the computed metrics to determine the stability prediction:\n    - Predict **destabilizing (1)** if ($\\overline{Le}_k  1$) OR ($Le_{k,\\min}  0.8$ AND $\\phi_{1} > 0.3$).\n    - Otherwise, predict **stabilizing/neutral (0)**.\n\nThis structured computational approach allows for a robust and reproducible evaluation of the flame's diffusive-thermal behavior for each set of parameters.",
