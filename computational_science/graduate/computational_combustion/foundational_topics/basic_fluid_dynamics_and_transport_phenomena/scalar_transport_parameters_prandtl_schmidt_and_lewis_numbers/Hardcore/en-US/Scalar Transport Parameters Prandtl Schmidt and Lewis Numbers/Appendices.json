This exercise provides a tangible link between the value of the Schmidt number, $Sc$, and a physical outcome: the thickness of a scalar boundary layer. By applying order-of-magnitude analysis to the advection-diffusion equation for a simplified jet, you will derive a fundamental scaling law that governs mixing in shear flows . This practice reinforces the physical meaning of transport parameters and develops crucial skills in analytical estimation.",

            "problem": "An axisymmetric round methane jet issues steadily into quiescent air at standard atmospheric pressure. The nozzle has diameter $D_{n}$ and the mean exit speed is $U_{0}$. The ambient air at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is initially free of methane. Assume the near-nozzle shear layer is laminar and that, over the short axial distances considered, density variations due to heating are negligible so that constant-property laminar boundary-layer scalings apply.\n\nTake the following properties and operating conditions as known and uniform: air kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, methane–air binary mass diffusivity $D_{AB}$, nozzle diameter $D_{n}$, mean exit speed $U_{0}$, and an axial location $x$ downstream of the nozzle plane where you wish to estimate the scalar boundary-layer thickness.\n\nStarting from (i) the definition of the Reynolds number $Re$ based on $D_{n}$, (ii) the definition of the Schmidt number $Sc$ based on $D_{AB}$, and (iii) the steady advection–diffusion equation for a passive scalar in a thin laminar shear layer derived from the conservation of species, use order-of-magnitude analysis to obtain an estimate for the scalar boundary-layer thickness $\\delta_{s}(x)$ at the axial location $x$. In your reasoning, use the balance between streamwise advection and cross-stream molecular diffusion to extract the characteristic transverse length scale.\n\nUse the numerical values:\n- $D_{n} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$,\n- $U_{0} = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$,\n- $\\nu = 1.54 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$,\n- $D_{AB} = 2.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$,\n- $x = 3.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nCompute $Re$ and $Sc$ to check the laminar and diffusive regimes and then estimate $\\delta_{s}(x)$. Express the final thickness in $\\mathrm{mm}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics and mass transfer, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively. The assumptions provided are standard for simplifying such problems for analytical estimation. We can thus proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for an estimate of the scalar boundary-layer thickness, $\\delta_{s}(x)$, for a methane jet issuing into air. This is a classic transport phenomena problem that can be analyzed using order-of-magnitude scaling of the governing conservation equation.\n\nThe governing equation for a steady-state, passive scalar concentration, $C$, in an axisymmetric flow is the advection-diffusion equation. In cylindrical coordinates $(x, r)$, where $x$ is the axial direction and $r$ is the radial direction, with corresponding velocity components $(u, v)$, the equation is:\n$$\nu \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} = D_{AB} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nHere, $D_{AB}$ is the binary mass diffusivity of methane in air.\n\nThe problem specifies that we are in the near-nozzle region where a thin laminar shear layer forms. For a thin shear layer (a boundary layer), transverse gradients are much larger than axial gradients. This means that changes in the radial direction $r$ occur over a much smaller length scale, $\\delta_s$, than changes in the axial direction $x$. Consequently, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\gg \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. This allows us to apply the boundary layer approximation, which states that axial diffusion is negligible compared to transverse (radial) diffusion. The term $\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}$ is therefore dropped, simplifying the equation to:\n$$\nu \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} = D_{AB} \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right)\n$$\nWe now perform an order-of-magnitude analysis on the remaining terms. Let the characteristic velocity in the streamwise ($x$) direction be the jet exit speed, $U_0$. The characteristic length scale in the $x$-direction is the axial distance from the nozzle, $x$. The characteristic length scale in the transverse ($r$) direction is the scalar boundary-layer thickness itself, $\\delta_s$. The characteristic concentration difference across the shear layer is $\\Delta C$, the difference between the methane concentration in the jet core and the ambient air.\n\nThe terms are scaled as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Streamwise advection: $u \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\sim U_0 \\frac{\\Delta C}{x}$\n    \\item Transverse diffusion: $D_{AB} \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right) \\sim D_{AB} \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\delta_s^2}$. In the thin layer, the curvature term $1/r$ does not change the fundamental scaling of the second derivative.\n\\end{itemize}\nFrom the continuity equation for an incompressible flow, we find that the transverse advection term, $v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r}$, is of the same order of magnitude as the streamwise advection term. Thus, the entire left-hand side (advection) scales as $U_0 \\frac{\\Delta C}{x}$.\n\nThe problem states that the growth of the boundary layer is governed by the balance between streamwise advection and cross-stream molecular diffusion. Equating the orders of magnitude of these two processes:\n$$\n\\text{Advection} \\sim \\text{Diffusion}\n$$\n$$\nU_0 \\frac{\\Delta C}{x} \\sim D_{AB} \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\delta_s^2}\n$$\nWe can cancel the characteristic concentration difference $\\Delta C$ from both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{U_0}{x} \\sim \\frac{D_{AB}}{\\delta_s^2}\n$$\nSolving for the scalar boundary-layer thickness, $\\delta_s(x)$, we obtain the scaling law:\n$$\n\\delta_s^2 \\sim \\frac{D_{AB} x}{U_0} \\implies \\delta_s(x) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{AB} x}{U_0}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the required estimate for the scalar boundary-layer thickness. Order-of-magnitude analysis implies the constant of proportionality is on the order of unity, so we will use $1$ for this estimation.\n\nBefore calculating the numerical value, we compute the Reynolds and Schmidt numbers as requested.\n\nThe Reynolds number, $Re$, based on the nozzle diameter $D_n$ is:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{U_0 D_n}{\\nu} = \\frac{(1.20\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) (2.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.54 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{2.40 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.54 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 155.8\n$$\nSince $Re \\approx 156$, which is much less than the typical critical Reynolds number for jet transition to turbulence (usually over $1000$), the assumption of a laminar shear layer is validated.\n\nThe Schmidt number, $Sc$, is the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) to mass diffusivity:\n$$\nSc = \\frac{\\nu}{D_{AB}} = \\frac{1.54 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}}{2.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}} = 0.70\n$$\nA Schmidt number less than $1$ indicates that mass diffuses more readily than momentum. This implies that the scalar boundary layer will be thicker than the velocity boundary layer ($\\delta_s  \\delta_v$).\n\nFinally, we compute the estimate for $\\delta_s(x)$ at $x = 3.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$\n\\delta_s(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{AB} x}{U_0}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(2.20 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s})(3.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{1.20\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_s(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{6.60 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/s}}{1.20\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}} = \\sqrt{5.50 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_s(x) \\approx 7.416198 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$) and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\delta_s(x) = (7.416198 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{1\\,\\mathrm{m}}\\right) \\approx 0.7416198\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\delta_s(x) = 0.7416\\,\\mathrm{mm}\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete set of definitions, constants, and test cases to derive and compute dimensionless scalar transport parameters, a standard task in computational combustion and fluid dynamics.\n\n### Derivation of Dimensionless Transport Numbers\n\nThe objective is to derive expressions for the Prandtl number ($Pr$), Schmidt number ($Sc$), and Lewis number ($Le$) from fundamental physical principles. These dimensionless numbers represent the ratios of different transport phenomena and are defined by comparing their characteristic diffusion time scales, which scale as $t \\sim L^2/\\text{diffusivity}$ for a characteristic length $L$. A smaller time scale implies faster diffusion. The ratios are therefore equivalent to ratios of the respective diffusivities.\n\nWe identify three key diffusive transport processes: momentum, heat, and mass.\n\n**1. Momentum Diffusivity ($\\nu$)**\n\nMomentum transport in a fluid is governed by viscous forces. For a Newtonian fluid, the viscous stress tensor leads to a diffusive flux of momentum. The governing equation for fluid motion, the Navier-Stokes equation, contains a term representing this diffusion:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = -\\nabla p + \\nabla \\cdot (\\mu (\\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T - \\frac{2}{3}(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})\\mathbf{I})) $$\nIn an incompressible flow or by analogy for the transport of shear momentum, the dominant diffusion term simplifies to a form proportional to $\\nabla \\cdot (\\mu \\nabla \\mathbf{u})$. The quantity being diffused is momentum per unit volume, $\\rho\\mathbf{u}$. The property controlling this diffusion is the dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$ ($\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$ or $\\mathrm{kg/(m \\cdot s)}$). To obtain a diffusivity with units of $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$, we define the momentum diffusivity, also known as the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$, as the ratio of dynamic viscosity to density $\\rho$:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho} $$\nThe units are $(\\mathrm{kg/(m \\cdot s)}) / (\\mathrm{kg/m^3}) = \\mathrm{m^2/s}$, which is consistent with the dimensions of a diffusivity.\n\n**2. Thermal Diffusivity ($\\alpha$)**\n\nHeat transport via conduction is described by Fourier's law, which states that the heat flux density $\\mathbf{q}$ is proportional to the temperature gradient: $\\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla T$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity ($\\mathrm{W/(m \\cdot K)}$). The conservation of energy for a fluid, neglecting viscous dissipation and other sources, can be written as:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{DT}{Dt} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T) $$\nwhere $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure ($\\mathrm{J/(kg \\cdot K)}$). To cast this into a standard diffusion equation form, $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = \\mathcal{D} \\nabla^2 \\phi$, we divide by $\\rho c_p$ (assuming constant properties for simplicity of derivation):\n$$ \\frac{DT}{Dt} = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} \\nabla^2 T $$\nFrom this, we identify the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$, as:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} $$\nIts units are $(\\mathrm{W/(m \\cdot K)}) / ((\\mathrm{kg/m^3}) (\\mathrm{J/(kg \\cdot K)})) = (\\mathrm{J/(s \\cdot m \\cdot K)}) / (\\mathrm{J/(m^3 \\cdot K/m^3)}) = \\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n\n**3. Mass Diffusivity ($D$)**\n\nMass transport of a chemical species due to concentration gradients is described by Fick's law. For a species with mass fraction $Y$, the mass flux $\\mathbf{J}$ is given by $\\mathbf{J} = -\\rho D \\nabla Y$, where $D$ is the mass diffusivity of the species in the mixture. The species conservation equation is:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{DY}{Dt} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho D \\nabla Y) $$\nBy inspection, the mass diffusivity is the coefficient $D$, which is typically provided with units of $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n\n**Formation of Dimensionless Numbers**\n\nThe Prandtl, Schmidt, and Lewis numbers are formed by taking ratios of these three diffusivities.\n\n*   **Prandtl Number ($Pr$)**: The Prandtl number compares the rate of momentum diffusion to the rate of thermal diffusion. It signifies the relative thickness of the momentum and thermal boundary layers.\n    $$ Pr = \\frac{\\text{momentum diffusivity}}{\\text{thermal diffusivity}} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\mu / \\rho}{k / (\\rho c_p)} $$\n    $$ Pr = \\frac{\\mu c_p}{k} $$\n\n*   **Schmidt Number ($Sc$)**: The Schmidt number compares the rate of momentum diffusion to the rate of mass diffusion. It is the analogue of the Prandtl number for mass transfer.\n    $$ Sc = \\frac{\\text{momentum diffusivity}}{\\text{mass diffusivity}} = \\frac{\\nu}{D} = \\frac{\\mu / \\rho}{D} $$\n    $$ Sc = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho D} $$\n\n*   **Lewis Number ($Le$)**: The Lewis number compares the rate of thermal diffusion to the rate of mass diffusion. It is crucial in combustion as it relates the transport of heat to the transport of fuel/oxidizer.

This exercise delves into the concept of numerical diffusion, a common error introduced by discretization schemes for advection . By analyzing how a first-order upwind scheme adds artificial diffusion, you will quantify how this error can \"masquerade\" as a change in the physical Prandtl and Schmidt numbers, thereby altering the fundamental transport behavior of the simulated system. This practice is essential for developing a critical eye for CFD results and understanding the profound impact of numerical choices.",

            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional steady transport of a thermal scalar (temperature) and a chemical species scalar (mass fraction) in a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) setting. Use the advection–diffusion model as the fundamental base: for a generic scalar $\\,\\phi\\,$ advected at speed $\\,U\\,$ over a characteristic length $\\,L\\,$, the governing equation is $\\,\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla \\phi = \\kappa \\nabla^{2}\\phi\\,$, where $\\,\\kappa\\,$ is a diffusivity. For thermal energy, $\\,\\kappa = \\alpha\\,$ (thermal diffusivity), and for species, $\\,\\kappa = D\\,$ (mass diffusivity). Kinematic viscosity is $\\,\\nu\\,$. By nondimensionalizing the transport equations with the scales $\\,U\\,$ and $\\,L\\,$, identify the dimensionless group that quantifies the ratio of advection to diffusion in each equation. Then, by comparing momentum diffusion to scalar diffusion, derive the dimensionless ratios that quantify relative momentum versus thermal transport and momentum versus species transport.\n\nSuppose the advection term is discretized with the first-order upwind scheme on a uniform grid of spacing $\\,\\Delta x\\,$. Use the well-tested modified-equation estimate for numerical diffusion to model discretization error as an additive, purely diffusive term with effective diffusivity $\\,D_{\\text{num}} = \\dfrac{U\\,\\Delta x}{2}\\,$ that acts equivalently on both the thermal and species equations. Define the effective thermal diffusivity and species diffusivity as $\\,\\alpha_{\\text{eff}} = \\alpha + D_{\\text{num}}\\,$ and $\\,D_{\\text{eff}} = D + D_{\\text{num}}\\,$. From these, define the corresponding effective momentum-to-scalar ratios. For each test case, compute all relevant dimensionless groups derived from the fundamental base and decide, for both thermal and species transport, whether numerical errors can masquerade as changes in the momentum-to-scalar ratios beyond a specified tolerance.\n\nYour program must, for each test case:\n- Compute the thermal advection-to-diffusion dimensionless group using the energy equation scales $\\,U\\,$ and $\\,L\\,$.\n- Compute the species advection-to-diffusion dimensionless group using the species equation scales $\\,U\\,$ and $\\,L\\,$.\n- Compute the physical momentum-to-thermal ratio and momentum-to-species ratio.\n- Compute the effective momentum-to-thermal ratio and momentum-to-species ratio by using $\\,\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}\\,$ and $\\,D_{\\text{eff}}\\,$.\n- Compute the thermal-to-species scalar ratio based on both physical and effective diffusivities.\n- Return two booleans per case indicating whether the relative deviation between physical and effective momentum-to-thermal ratios, and between physical and effective momentum-to-species ratios, exceeds the specified tolerance $\\,r_{\\text{tol}}\\,$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics and numerical methods, and objectively defined. It presents a clear task of calculating and analyzing dimensionless transport parameters in the presence of numerical error. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem revolves around the steady, one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation for a scalar quantity $\\phi$:\n$$ U \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\kappa \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} $$\nwhere $U$ is the advection velocity and $\\kappa$ is the diffusivity of the scalar $\\phi$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Dimensionless Groups**\n\nTo analyze the physical behavior, we nondimensionalize the equation using a characteristic velocity $U$ and length scale $L$. Let's define the dimensionless variables: $x^* = x/L$. The derivatives become:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\frac{d\\phi}{dx^*} \\frac{dx^*}{dx} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx^*} $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^{*2}} $$\nSubstituting these into the governing equation yields:\n$$ U \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx^*} = \\kappa \\frac{1}{L^2} \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^{*2}} $$\nMultiplying by $L/U$ to make the advection term have a coefficient of $1$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi}{dx^*} = \\frac{\\kappa}{UL} \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^{*2}} $$\nThe dimensionless group that appears is the inverse of the Péclet number, $\\text{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{\\kappa}$. The Péclet number represents the ratio of the rate of advection of a physical quantity to its rate of diffusion. A large Péclet number signifies that advection dominates diffusion.\n\nFor thermal transport, the scalar is temperature, and the diffusivity is the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$. The relevant advection-to-diffusion ratio is the thermal Péclet number:\n$$ \\text{Pe}_T = \\frac{UL}{\\alpha} $$\nFor species transport, the scalar is mass fraction, and its diffusivity is the mass diffusivity, $D$. The corresponding ratio is the mass Péclet number:\n$$ \\text{Pe}_M = \\frac{UL}{D} $$\n\n**2. Relative Transport Ratios: Prandtl, Schmidt, and Lewis Numbers**\n\nThe problem also requires comparing momentum diffusion to scalar diffusion. The diffusivity for momentum is the kinematic viscosity, $\\nu$. The key dimensionless numbers are:\n-   **Prandtl Number ($\\text{Pr}$)**: The ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity.\n    $$ \\text{Pr} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha} $$\n-   **Schmidt Number ($\\text{Sc}$)**: The ratio of momentum diffusivity to mass (species) diffusivity.\n    $$ \\text{Sc} = \\frac{\\nu}{D} $$\n-   **Lewis Number ($\\text{Le}$)**: The ratio of thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity. It relates the other two ratios: $\\text{Le} = \\text{Sc}/\\text{Pr}$.\n    $$ \\text{Le} = \\frac{\\alpha}{D} $$\nThese numbers are properties of the fluid and are crucial for correctly modeling coupled heat, mass, and momentum transfer.\n\n**3. Effect of Numerical Diffusion**\n\nWhen the advection term is discretized using a first-order upwind scheme, it introduces a leading-order error term that acts like a diffusion term. This is known as numerical or artificial diffusion. The problem provides a model for this numerical diffusivity:\n$$ D_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{U \\Delta x}{2} $$\nwhere $\\Delta x$ is the grid spacing. This numerical diffusion is an artifact of the computational method and adds to the physical diffusion, contaminating the simulation. The effective diffusivities for the thermal and species transport equations become:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{eff}} = \\alpha + D_{\\text{num}} = \\alpha + \\frac{U \\Delta x}{2} $$\n$$ D_{\\text{eff}} = D + D_{\\text{num}} = D + \\frac{U \\Delta x}{2} $$\nThis leads to \"effective\" dimensionless numbers that the simulation is actually solving for, rather than the true physical ones. The effective Prandtl, Schmidt, and Lewis numbers are:\n$$ \\text{Pr}_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha + \\frac{U \\Delta x}{2}} $$\n$$ \\text{Sc}_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\nu}{D_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\nu}{D + \\frac{U \\Delta x}{2}} $$\n$$ \\text{Le}_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}}{D_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\alpha + \\frac{U \\Delta x}{2}}{D + \\frac{U \\Delta x}{2}} $$\nA critical observation is that $D_{\\text{num}}$ is the same for both scalars, which drives the effective Lewis number, $\\text{Le}_{\\text{eff}}$, towards $1$ as numerical diffusion becomes dominant.\n\n**4. The \"Masquerade\" Criterion**\n\nThe numerical scheme can \"masquerade\" as a fluid with different physical properties if the effective parameters deviate significantly from the physical ones. We quantify this using the relative deviation, with a given tolerance $r_{\\text{tol}}$.\n-   For thermal transport, we check if the relative change in the Prandtl number exceeds the tolerance:\n    $$ \\left| \\frac{\\text{Pr}_{\\text{eff}} - \\text{Pr}_{\\text{phys}}}{\\text{Pr}_{\\text{phys}}} \\right|  r_{\\text{tol}} $$\n-   For species transport, we check the relative change in the Schmidt number:\n    $$ \\left| \\frac{\\text{Sc}_{\\text{eff}} - \\text{Sc}_{\\text{phys}}}{\\text{Sc}_{\\text{phys}}} \\right|  r_{\\text{tol}} $$\n\n**5. Computational Procedure**\n\nFor each test case, the following quantities will be computed in order:\n1.  **Thermal Advection-Diffusion Number**: $\\text{Pe}_T = \\frac{UL}{\\alpha}$\n2.  **Species Advection-Diffusion Number**: $\\text{Pe}_M = \\frac{UL}{D}$\n3.  **Effective Momentum-to-Thermal Ratio**: $\\text{Pr}_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\nu}{\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}}$\n4.  **Effective Momentum-to-Species Ratio**: $\\text{Sc}_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\nu}{D_{\\text{eff}}}$\n5.  **Effective Thermal-to-Species Scalar Ratio**: $\\text{Le}_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}}{D_{\\text{eff}}}$\n6.  **Boolean for Thermal Masquerade**: Evaluate $\\left| \\frac{\\text{Pr}_{\\text{eff}}}{\\text{Pr}_{\\text{phys}}} - 1 \\right|  r_{\\text{tol}}$\n7.  **Boolean for Species Masquerade**: Evaluate $\\left| \\frac{\\text{Sc}_{\\text{eff}}}{\\text{Sc}_{\\text{phys}}} - 1 \\right|  r_{\\text{tol}}$\n\nThese calculations will be implemented for the five specified test cases.",
