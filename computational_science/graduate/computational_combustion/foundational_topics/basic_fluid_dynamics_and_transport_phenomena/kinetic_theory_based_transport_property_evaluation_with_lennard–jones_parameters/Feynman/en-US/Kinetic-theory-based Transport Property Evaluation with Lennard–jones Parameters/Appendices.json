It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the solution.\n\nThe shear viscosity, $\\mu$, quantifies the transport of momentum in a fluid subjected to a velocity gradient. In the framework of the kinetic theory of gases, this property can be derived from the Boltzmann transport equation. For a dilute monatomic gas, the Chapman–Enskog expansion provides a systematic method for solving the Boltzmann equation and obtaining expressions for transport coefficients. The first-order approximation for the shear viscosity is given by the well-known expression:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{5}{16} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi m k_B T}}{\\pi \\sigma^2 \\Omega^{(2,2)}(T)}\n$$\nHere, $m$ is the mass of a single molecule, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The parameter $\\sigma$ represents a characteristic length scale of the intermolecular potential, often interpreted as an effective molecular diameter. The term $\\Omega^{(2,2)}(T)$ is a dimensionless collision integral for viscosity (and thermal conductivity). It accounts for the dynamics of binary collisions and depends on the specific form of the intermolecular potential and the temperature. For potentials characterized by an energy scale $\\varepsilon$ and a length scale $\\sigma$, such as the Lennard-Jones potential, the collision integral is naturally a function of the reduced temperature, $T^* = k_B T / \\varepsilon$. The notation $(2,2)$ for the omega integral arises from the orders of the Sonine polynomials used in the CE expansion.\n\nThe hard-sphere (HS) model is a simplified intermolecular potential where molecules are treated as perfectly rigid, elastic spheres of diameter $\\sigma$. The potential energy is infinite for intermolecular separation $r  \\sigma$ and zero for $r \\ge \\sigma$. In this model, the collision dynamics are independent of the relative kinetic energy of the colliding particles. Consequently, the collision integral $\\Omega^{(2,2)}$ is independent of temperature. By convention, the collision integrals for realistic potentials are normalized by their hard-sphere values. Therefore, for the hard-sphere model, we have:\n$$\n\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{HS}} = 1\n$$\nThe viscosity of a hard-sphere gas, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HS}}$, is then given by simplifying the general expression:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{HS}}(T) = \\frac{5}{16 \\sigma^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{m k_B T}{\\pi}}\n$$\nThis expression shows the characteristic $T^{1/2}$ temperature dependence for the viscosity of a hard-sphere gas.\n\nFor the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, the viscosity, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{LJ}}$, is given by the general formula where $\\Omega^{(2,2)}$ is calculated for the LJ potential. This is denoted as $\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*)$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T) = \\frac{5}{16 \\sigma^2 \\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*)} \\sqrt{\\frac{m k_B T}{\\pi}}\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the maximum fractional error $E(T)$ of the hard-sphere viscosity relative to the Lennard-Jones viscosity. Let's substitute the expressions for $\\mu_{\\mathrm{HS}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{LJ}}$ into the definition of $E(T)$. For convenience, let the constant pre-factors be represented by $C(T) = \\frac{5}{16 \\sigma^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{m k_B T}{\\pi}}$.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{HS}}(T) = C(T) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T) = \\frac{C(T)}{\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*)}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $E(T)$:\n$$\nE(T) = \\frac{|C(T) - \\frac{C(T)}{\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*)}|}{\\frac{C(T)}{\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*)}} = \\frac{|1 - \\frac{1}{\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*)}|}{\\frac{1}{\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*)}} = \\left| \\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*)}\\right) \\right| = |\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*) - 1|\n$$\nThe problem provides an empirical fit for $\\Omega^{(2,2)}_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(T^*)$ in the range $0.5 \\le T^* \\le 20$:\n$$\n\\Omega^{(2,2)}(T^*) = 1 + 0.25\\,{T^*}^{-1/2} + 0.40\\,\\exp(-0.80\\,T^*)\n$$\nFor $T^* > 0$, both ${T^*}^{-1/2}$ and $\\exp(-0.80\\,T^*)$ are positive quantities. Therefore, $\\Omega^{(2,2)}(T^*) > 1$ over the specified domain. This allows us to remove the absolute value signs:\n$$\nE(T^*) = \\Omega^{(2,2)}(T^*) - 1 = 0.25\\,{T^*}^{-1/2} + 0.40\\,\\exp(-0.80\\,T^*)\n$$\nTo find the maximum value of $E(T^*)$ on the closed interval $[0.5, 20]$, we analyze its derivative with respect to $T^*$. Let $x = T^*$. We are analyzing the function $f(x) = 0.25\\,x^{-1/2} + 0.40\\,\\exp(-0.80\\,x)$.\nThe first derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dT^*} = \\frac{d}{dT^*} \\left( 0.25\\,(T^*)^{-1/2} + 0.40\\,\\exp(-0.80\\,T^*) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dT^*} = 0.25 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} (T^*)^{-3/2}\\right) + 0.40 \\left(-0.80\\,\\exp(-0.80\\,T^*)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{dT^*} = -0.125\\,(T^*)^{-3/2} - 0.32\\,\\exp(-0.80\\,T^*)\n$$\nFor any $T^* > 0$, both terms in the derivative are negative. Specifically, $(T^*)^{-3/2} > 0$ and $\\exp(-0.80\\,T^*) > 0$. Thus, $\\frac{dE}{dT^*}  0$ for all $T^*$ in the domain $[0.5, 20]$. This indicates that the function $E(T^*)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function over this interval.\n\nFor a monotonically decreasing function on a closed interval $[a, b]$, the maximum value occurs at the left endpoint, $a$. In this case, the interval for $T^*$ is $[0.5, 20]$, so the maximum value of $E(T^*)$ will occur at $T^* = 0.5$.\n\nWe now calculate the value of $E$ at $T^*=0.5$:\n$$\nE_{\\max} = E(0.5) = 0.25\\,(0.5)^{-1/2} + 0.40\\,\\exp(-0.80 \\times 0.5)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\max} = 0.25 \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.5}}\\right) + 0.40\\,\\exp(-0.40)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\max} = 0.25\\,\\sqrt{2} + 0.40\\,\\exp(-0.40)\n$$\nUsing the numerical values $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356$ and $\\exp(-0.40) \\approx 0.67032005$:\n$$\nE_{\\max} \\approx 0.25 \\times 1.41421356 + 0.40 \\times 0.67032005\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\max} \\approx 0.35355339 + 0.26812802\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\max} \\approx 0.62168141\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required, we get $0.6217$.",

The problem provides species-specific values for $\\epsilon/k_{\\mathrm{B}}$, which has units of temperature (kelvin), allowing for the simplified calculation $T^* = T / (\\epsilon/k_{\\mathrm{B}})$.\n\nCalculating $\\Omega^{(l,s)}(T^*)$ directly involves complex numerical integration of the classical scattering angle over a range of impact parameters and relative kinetic energies. To avoid this computational expense, well-tested empirical correlations are widely used in practice. The problem provides such correlations for $\\Omega^{(1,1)}(T^*)$ and $\\Omega^{(2,2)}(T^*)$, which are the most critical for calculating diffusion and viscosity/thermal conductivity, respectively. These correlations serve as our \"ground truth\" reference functions.\n- For $(l,s) = (1,1)$:\n$$\n\\Omega^{(1,1)}(T^*) = \\frac{1.06036}{(T^*)^{0.15610}} + 0.19300 \\, e^{-0.47635 \\, T^*} + 1.03587 \\, e^{-1.52996 \\, T^*} + 1.76474 \\, e^{-3.89411 \\, T^*}\n$$\n- For $(l,s) = (2,2)$:\n$$\n\\Omega^{(2,2)}(T^*) = \\frac{1.16145}{(T^*)^{0.14874}} + 0.52487 \\, e^{-0.77320 \\, T^*} + 2.16178 \\, e^{-2.43787 \\, T^*}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Approximation and Error Analysis\n\nThe core task is to approximate these continuous, non-polynomial functions $\\Omega^{(l,s)}(T^*)$ with simpler functional forms over a finite range of $T^*$ relevant to combustion applications ($T \\in [300\\,\\mathrm{K}, 3000\\,\\mathrm{K}]$). We evaluate two standard numerical approximation techniques:\n\n1.  **Degree-$5$ Polynomial Least-Squares Fit**: An approximant $p(T^*)$ of degree $5$ is constructed. Since the fit is based on $12$ training points, which is greater than the number of polynomial coefficients ($5+1=6$), the coefficients are determined by the method of least squares. This method finds the unique polynomial that minimizes the sum of squared errors at the training points. It is a robust method for creating a global approximation over an interval.\n\n2.  **Cubic Spline Interpolation**: A spline approximant $s(T^*)$ is constructed. This method creates a piecewise function composed of cubic polynomials that join smoothly at the $12$ training points (knots). The 'not-a-knot' boundary condition, as specified, provides a naturalistic termination of the spline by forcing the third derivative to be continuous across the second and second-to-last knots. Splines are excellent for interpolation as they avoid the oscillatory behavior (Runge's phenomenon) that can plague high-degree global polynomial interpolants.\n\nThe accuracy of these approximations is quantified using the maximum relative error over a dense evaluation grid $\\mathcal{G}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\max_{T^* \\in \\mathcal{G}} \\left| \\frac{\\widehat{\\Omega}^{(l,s)}(T^*) - \\Omega^{(l,s)}(T^*)}{\\Omega^{(l,s)}(T^*)} \\right|\n$$\nwhere $\\widehat{\\Omega}^{(l,s)}(T^*)$ represents either the polynomial $p(T^*)$ or the spline $s(T^*)$. The relative error is a percentage-like measure that normalizes the absolute error by the true function's magnitude, making it a more meaningful metric for functions that vary significantly over their domain.\n\n### Algorithmic Implementation\n\nThe solution is implemented by following a systematic procedure for each of the $3$ species and $2$ collision integrals.\n\n1.  **Define Species-Specific $T^*$ Range**: For each species, the physical temperature range $T \\in [300\\,\\mathrm{K}, 3000\\,\\mathrm{K}]$ is mapped to a species-specific reduced temperature range $[T^*_{\\min}, T^*_{\\max}]$ using its given $\\epsilon/k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ value.\n\n2.  **Generate Grids**: Two uniform grids are established on the interval $[T^*_{\\min}, T^*_{\\max}]$:\n    - A sparse training grid of $12$ points used to construct the approximants.\n    - A dense evaluation grid of $200$ points used to compute the ground-truth function and accurately estimate the maximum error of the approximants.\n\n3.  **Construct Approximants**: For each collision integral function, $\\Omega^{(l,s)}(T^*)$:\n    - The true function values are calculated at the $12$ training points.\n    - These training pairs $(T^*, \\Omega^{(l,s)}(T^*))$ are used to build the degree-$5$ polynomial fit using `numpy.polyfit` and the cubic spline using `scipy.interpolate.CubicSpline`.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Errors**:\n    - The true function and both approximants are evaluated on the dense $200$-point grid.\n    - The relative error is computed at each point on the grid for both the polynomial and the spline.\n    - The maximum value of the relative error is identified for each approximant, yielding the final error metrics.\n\n5.  **Aggregate Results**: The two error metrics (polynomial and spline) are calculated for each of the $6$ combinations of species and collision integral, resulting in $12$ final values. These are collected in the specified order and formatted for output.",
