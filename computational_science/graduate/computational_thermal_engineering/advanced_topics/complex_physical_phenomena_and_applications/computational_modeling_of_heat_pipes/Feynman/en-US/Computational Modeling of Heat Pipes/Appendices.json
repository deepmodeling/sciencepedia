The concepts of steady-state energy conservation, Fourier's law, and the use of lumped parameter models (effective thermal resistance $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and effective thermal conductivity $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) are standard and fundamental in thermal engineering.

The problem provides all necessary data ($Q$, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) for the final numerical calculation. The contextual data ($L$, $D$, $k_{\\mathrm{Cu}}$) is clearly demarcated for an interpretive comparison and does not create any contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all its components are consistent and clearly defined. It represents a standard problem in introductory thermal systems analysis. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem asks for two main things: first, to derive the linear lumped relation between the temperature drop $\\Delta T$ and the heat rate $Q$ in terms of an effective thermal resistance $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$; second, to use this relation to compute a specific value for $\\Delta T$.\n\nThe concept of a lumped thermal element inherently implies a linear relationship between the thermal potential difference (temperature drop $\\Delta T$) and the thermal current (heat rate $Q$). This relationship is the definition of thermal resistance, analogous to Ohm's law in electrical circuits. The problem statement itself posits this: \"a single lumped element that linearly relates the net axial heat rate $Q$ to the temperature drop $\\Delta T$\". The mathematical expression for this linear relation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\Delta T}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the constant of proportionality, defined as the effective thermal resistance of the lumped element. Rearranging this equation gives the direct relationship between $\\Delta T$ and $Q$:\n$$\\Delta T = Q R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\nThis equation is the fundamental a-priori definition of the lumped-element thermal resistance model.\n\nThe problem further requires this lumped model to be related to a Fourier-type conduction model through an effective thermal conductivity, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Let us start with the provided governing equations for one-dimensional steady-state conduction.\nConservation of energy in one dimension at steady state dictates that the axial heat flux $q_x$ is constant with position $x$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dx} q_x = 0 \\implies q_x = \\mathrm{constant}$$\nThe total axial heat rate $Q$ is the product of the flux and the cross-sectional area over which it is defined, $A$. Thus, $Q = q_x A$, which is also constant along the pipe's length.\n\nThe problem provides a definition for an effective thermal conductivity, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which makes the behavior of the entire heat pipe analogous to that of a simple solid conductor. This definition is given as:\n$$Q = k_{\\mathrm{eff}} A \\frac{\\Delta T}{L}$$\nBy rearranging this definitional equation, we can express the temperature drop as:\n$$\\Delta T = Q \\left( \\frac{L}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}} A} \\right)$$\nNow, we compare the two expressions for $\\Delta T$ from the two equivalent lumped representations:\n$$ \\Delta T = Q R_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Delta T = Q \\left( \\frac{L}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}} A} \\right) $$\nThis comparison establishes the relationship between the effective thermal resistance and the effective thermal conductivity for this one-dimensional lumped model:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{L}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}} A}$$\nThis confirms the consistency of the two modeling approaches. The primary linear lumped relation in terms of resistance remains $\\Delta T = Q R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nNext, we proceed to the numerical calculation. The problem provides the following values:\nNet axial heat rate, $Q = 100\\ \\mathrm{W}$.\nEffective thermal resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{K/W}$.\n\nUsing the derived and defined linear relationship:\n$$\\Delta T = Q R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\\Delta T = (100\\ \\mathrm{W}) \\times (0.05\\ \\mathrm{K/W}) = 5\\ \\mathrm{K}$$\nThe question asks for the result to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the temperature drop is $\\Delta T = 5.00\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nFor the purpose of interpretation as requested in the problem description, we can calculate the effective thermal conductivity $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ of the heat pipe. The required parameters are given: $L = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $D = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{K/W}$. The cross-sectional area $A$ is defined as:\n$$A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (8.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (64 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2)}{4} = 1.6 \\pi \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2$$\nUsing the relationship $R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = L/(k_{\\mathrm{eff}} A)$, we solve for $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{L}{R_{\\mathrm{eff}} A} = \\frac{0.30\\ \\mathrm{m}}{(0.05\\ \\mathrm{K/W}) (1.6 \\pi \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2)} \\approx 119366\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$$\nThis value can be written as approximately $1.2 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$. We are asked to compare this to the thermal conductivity of copper, $k_{\\mathrm{Cu}} = 400\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$. The ratio is $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}/k_{\\mathrm{Cu}} \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^5 / 400 \\approx 300$. This demonstrates that the heat pipe, through its two-phase heat transfer mechanism (evaporation and condensation of a working fluid), acts as a \"superconductor\" of heat, with an effective thermal conductivity that is orders of magnitude greater than that of even a highly conductive solid metal like copper. This is a characteristic feature of heat pipes and justifies their use in high-performance thermal management applications. This interpretation, however, is contextual and does not form part of the final numerical answer.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of the temperature drop, $\\Delta T$.\n$\\Delta T = 5.00\\ \\mathrm{K}$.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Analytical Solution**\n\nThe flow is governed by the steady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, with the $z$-axis aligned with the pipe's centerline, the velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v} = (v_r, v_\\theta, v_z)$.\n\nThe problem states the following simplifying assumptions:\n1.  **Steady flow**: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\cdot) = 0$.\n2.  **Axisymmetric flow**: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} (\\cdot) = 0$ and the tangential velocity component is zero, $v_\\theta = 0$.\n3.  **Fully developed axial flow**: The radial velocity component is zero, $v_r = 0$, and the axial velocity profile does not change along the $z$-axis, $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$. This also implies $v_z = v_z(r)$ only.\n4.  **No gravity along the axis**: $g_z = 0$.\n\nLet's apply these assumptions to the governing equations. The continuity equation for an incompressible fluid ($\\rho = \\text{constant}$) is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r v_r) + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial v_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nWith $v_r=0$, $v_\\theta=0$, and $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z}=0$, the continuity equation is identically satisfied: $0+0+0=0$.\n\nNow, consider the momentum equations. Due to the assumptions, the $r$- and $\\theta$-momentum equations are trivially satisfied or show that pressure is not a function of $r$ or $\\theta$, i.e., $p=p(z)$. The substantive dynamics are captured by the $z$-momentum (axial) equation:\n$$ \\rho \\left( v_r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} + \\frac{v_\\theta}{r}\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta} + v_z \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right] + \\rho g_z $$\nApplying the assumptions ($v_r=0$, $v_z\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z}=0$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2}=0$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2}=0$, $g_z=0$), this equation simplifies dramatically:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dp}{dz} + \\frac{\\mu}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{dv_z}{dr}\\right) $$\nSince $p=p(z)$ and $v_z=v_z(r)$, the term $\\frac{dp}{dz}$ must be a constant, as it equals a function of $r$. Let's denote this constant pressure gradient as $C = \\frac{dp}{dz}$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r\\frac{dv_z}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{C}{\\mu}r $$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$ once:\n$$ r\\frac{dv_z}{dr} = \\frac{C}{2\\mu}r^2 + A $$\nDividing by $r$ and integrating a second time:\n$$ \\frac{dv_z}{dr} = \\frac{C}{2\\mu}r + \\frac{A}{r} $$\n$$ v_z(r) = \\frac{C}{4\\mu}r^2 + A \\ln(r) + B $$\nHere, $A$ and $B$ are constants of integration determined by the boundary conditions.\n\n1.  **Regularity at the centerline ($r=0$):** The velocity must be finite at the center of the pipe. As $\\ln(r) \\to -\\infty$ when $r \\to 0$, we must have $A=0$.\n2.  **No-slip condition at the wall ($r=R$):** The fluid velocity is zero at the wall, $v_z(R)=0$.\n    $$ v_z(R) = 0 = \\frac{C}{4\\mu}R^2 + B \\implies B = -\\frac{C R^2}{4\\mu} $$\nSubstituting the constants $A$ and $B$ back into the velocity profile:\n$$ v_z(r) = \\frac{C}{4\\mu}r^2 - \\frac{C R^2}{4\\mu} = \\frac{C}{4\\mu}(r^2 - R^2) $$\nThe pressure drop over a length $L$ is $\\Delta p = p_0 - p_L$. Since flow is from higher to lower pressure, $\\frac{dp}{dz} = \\frac{p_L - p_0}{L} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$. So, $C = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$.\nSubstituting this for $C$ gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ v_z(r) = \\frac{-\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}(r^2 - R^2) = \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}(R^2 - r^2) $$\nNext, we relate this velocity profile to the total mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$. The mass flow rate is the integral of the mass flux, $\\rho v_z$, over the cross-sectional area of the pipe.\n$$ \\dot{m} = \\int_{A_c} \\rho v_z(r) dA $$\nUsing a differential area element $dA = 2\\pi r dr$:\n$$ \\dot{m} = \\int_0^R \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\Delta p}{4\\mu L}(R^2 - r^2) \\right) 2\\pi r dr $$\nWe can take the constant terms outside the integral:\n$$ \\dot{m} = \\frac{2\\pi \\rho \\Delta p}{4\\mu L} \\int_0^R (R^2 - r^2)r dr = \\frac{\\pi \\rho \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr $$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$ \\int_0^R (R^2 r - r^3) dr = \\left[ \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_0^R = \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) - 0 = \\frac{R^4}{4} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for $\\dot{m}$:\n$$ \\dot{m} = \\frac{\\pi \\rho \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\rho \\Delta p R^4}{8\\mu L} $$\nThis is the relation between mass flow rate and pressure drop. The problem asks for an analytical relation for $\\Delta p$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{8 \\mu L \\dot{m}}{\\pi \\rho R^4} $$\nThis is the well-known Hagen-Poiseuille equation adapted for mass flow rate.\n\n**Step 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n- $\\rho = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n- $L = 0.300\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $R = 5.00\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 5.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\dot{m} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}$\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula for $\\Delta p$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{8 (1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}) (0.300\\ \\mathrm{m}) (1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg/s})}{\\pi (0.6\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}) (5.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})^4} $$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 8 \\times 1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 0.300 \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{-3} = 2.4 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s \\cdot m \\cdot kg/s} $$\nNext, calculate the denominator:\n$$ (5.00 \\times 10^{-3})^4 = 5.00^4 \\times 10^{-12} = 625 \\times 10^{-12} = 6.25 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^4} $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = \\pi \\times 0.6 \\times (6.25 \\times 10^{-10}) \\approx 1.178097 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot m} $$\nNow, compute the ratio:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{2.4 \\times 10^{-8}}{1.178097 \\times 10^{-9}}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} \\approx 20.37183\\ \\mathrm{Pa} $$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta p \\approx 20.37\\ \\mathrm{Pa} $$\nThe final answer is $20.37$ Pascals.",

Hydrostatic Pressure ($\\Delta P_{grav}$): For a vertical column of liquid with density $\\rho$ and height $L$ in a gravitational field with acceleration $g$, the hydrostatic pressure difference is:\n    $$\n    \\Delta P_{grav} = \\rho g L\n    $$\n    This term opposes the capillary-driven flow, as the liquid must be wicked upward from the evaporator (presumably at the bottom) to the condenser (at the top).\n\n3.  Viscous Pressure Drop ($\\Delta P_{visc}$): Darcy's law for one-dimensional, incompressible, laminar flow through a porous medium with permeability $k$ and fluid dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ relates the pressure gradient to the superficial velocity $v$:\n    $$\n    v = -\\frac{k}{\\mu}\\frac{dP}{dx}\n    $$\n    For flow over an effective axial length $L$, the pressure drop is approximated as:\n    $$\n    \\Delta P_{visc} = \\frac{\\mu v L}{k}\n    $$\n    The superficial velocity $v$ is related to the mass flow rate of the liquid, $\\dot{m}$, the liquid density $\\rho$, and the wick's cross-sectional area available for flow, $A_{w}$:\n    $$\n    v = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{\\rho A_{w}}\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the expression for $\\Delta P_{visc}$ yields:\n    $$\n    \\Delta P_{visc} = \\frac{\\mu L \\dot{m}}{\\rho k A_{w}}\n    $$\n    The heat transport $Q$ is proportional to the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ and the latent heat of vaporization $h_{fg}$:\n    $$\n    Q = \\dot{m} h_{fg} \\implies \\dot{m} = \\frac{Q}{h_{fg}}\n    $$\n    At the maximum heat transport capacity, $Q_{max}$, the mass flow rate is at its maximum. Substituting this into the viscous pressure drop equation gives the pressure drop at the capillary limit:\n    $$\n    \\Delta P_{visc} = \\frac{\\mu L Q_{max}}{\\rho k A_{w} h_{fg}}\n    $$\n\nNow, we substitute all the derived pressure terms back into the governing pressure balance equation:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\sigma\\cos(\\theta)}{r_{p}} = \\frac{\\mu L Q_{max}}{\\rho k A_{w} h_{fg}} + \\rho g L\n$$\nSolving this equation for $Q_{max}$ provides the closed-form expression for the maximum axial heat transport:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu L Q_{max}}{\\rho k A_{w} h_{fg}} = \\frac{2\\sigma\\cos(\\theta)}{r_{p}} - \\rho g L\n$$\n$$\nQ_{max} = \\frac{\\rho k A_{w} h_{fg}}{\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{2\\sigma\\cos(\\theta)}{r_{p}} - \\rho g L \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression. A positive heat transport ($Q_{max} > 0$) is possible only if the capillary pressure is greater than the hydrostatic pressure, i.e., $\\frac{2\\sigma\\cos(\\theta)}{r_p} > \\rho g L$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $Q_{max}$ by substituting the given parameters:\n- $\\sigma = 0.072\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$\n- $\\theta = 10^{\\circ}$\n- $r_{p} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $k = 1 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$\n- $\\mu = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n- $L = 0.3\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\rho = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n- $g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n- $A_{w} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$\n- $h_{fg} = 2.26 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{J/kg}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the pressure terms:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{cap, max} = \\frac{2(0.072)\\cos(10^{\\circ})}{10 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 14181.23\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta P_{grav} = (1000)(9.81)(0.3) = 2943\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe condition $\\Delta P_{cap, max} > \\Delta P_{grav}$ is satisfied. The net pressure available to overcome viscous forces is:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{cap, max} - \\Delta P_{grav} \\approx 14181.23 - 2943 = 11238.23\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the coefficient term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho k A_{w} h_{fg}}{\\mu L} = \\frac{(1000)(1 \\times 10^{-12})(1.0 \\times 10^{-4})(2.26 \\times 10^{6})}{(1 \\times 10^{-3})(0.3)}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2.26 \\times 10^{-7}}{3 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 7.5333 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{W}}{\\mathrm{Pa}}\n$$\nMultiplying these results gives $Q_{max}$:\n$$\nQ_{max} \\approx (7.5333 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (11238.23) \\approx 8.46617\\ \\mathrm{W}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain the final answer.",
