A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation for the reversible heat rate begins with the differential of the Gibbs free energy, $G$:\n$$dG = -S\\,dT + V\\,dP + \\sum_i \\mu_i\\,dn_i$$\nHere, $S$ is entropy, $T$ is absolute temperature, $V$ is volume, $P$ is pressure, $\\mu_i$ are the chemical potentials of species $i$, and $n_i$ are the mole numbers.\n\nUnder isobaric conditions, the change in pressure $dP$ is zero, so the $V\\,dP$ term vanishes:\n$$dG = -S\\,dT + \\sum_i \\mu_i\\,dn_i$$\nThe term $\\sum_i \\mu_i\\,dn_i$ represents the change in Gibbs free energy due to the chemical reaction at constant $T$ and $P$. This change is equal to the maximum non-$PV$ work that can be extracted from the system. In an electrochemical cell, this is the reversible electrical work. The electrical work done *by* the cell when an infinitesimal charge $dq$ flows is $U\\,dq$, where $U$ is the open-circuit voltage. The change in Gibbs energy is the negative of the work done by the system, so:\n$$\\sum_i \\mu_i\\,dn_i = -U\\,dq$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $dG$ gives:\n$$dG = -S\\,dT - U\\,dq$$\nThis expression shows $G$ as a state function of temperature $T$ and charge passed $q$. As $dG$ is an exact differential, we can write:\n$$dG = \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T}\\right)_q dT + \\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial q}\\right)_T dq$$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $dG$, we can identify the partial derivatives:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T}\\right)_q = -S$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial q}\\right)_T = -U$$\nSince $G$ is a well-behaved state function, its mixed second partial derivatives must be equal (Maxwell's relation):\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial T}\\right)_q = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial q}\\right)_T$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the first derivatives yields:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}(-S) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}(-U)$$\n$$-\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q}\\right)_T = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_q$$\nTherefore, we arrive at the following thermodynamic identity for an electrochemical cell:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q}\\right)_T = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_q$$\nThe problem asks for the reversible heat rate, $\\dot{Q}_{rev}$. From the second law of thermodynamics, for a reversible process, the incremental heat absorbed by the system is $dQ_{rev} = T\\,dS$. The rate of heat absorption is thus:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{rev} = T \\frac{dS}{dt}$$\nUsing the chain rule, we can express $\\frac{dS}{dt}$ in terms of the rate of charge flow. Assuming constant temperature:\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q}\\right)_T \\frac{dq}{dt}$$\nThe rate of charge flow, $\\frac{dq}{dt}$, is the electric current, $I$. For a discharging cell, a positive current $I$ flows out of the positive terminal.\n$$\\frac{dq}{dt} = I$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\dot{Q}_{rev}$:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{rev} = T \\cdot I \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q}\\right)_T$$\nFinally, using the Maxwell relation we derived, we substitute $\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_q$ for $\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q}\\right)_T$:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{rev} = I \\cdot T \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_q$$\nThis is the derived expression for the reversible heat rate. A positive value for $\\dot{Q}_{rev}$ signifies heat absorption by the cell (endothermic process, or reversible cooling), while a negative value signifies heat release (exothermic process, or reversible heating).\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical values:\n- Current $I = 50$ A\n- Temperature $T = 298$ K\n- Temperature coefficient $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T} = -0.2$ mV/K $= -0.2 \\times 10^{-3}$ V/K\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{rev} = (50 \\text{ A}) \\cdot (298 \\text{ K}) \\cdot (-0.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ V/K})$$\n$$\\dot{Q}_{rev} = (50 \\cdot 298 \\cdot -0.2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\text{ W}$$\n$$\\dot{Q}_{rev} = (14900) \\cdot (-0.2 \\times 10^{-3}) \\text{ W}$$\n$$\\dot{Q}_{rev} = -2.98 \\text{ W}$$\nThe result, rounded to three significant figures as requested, is $-2.98$ W.\n\nThe sign of the reversible heat rate is negative. This indicates that heat is being released by the cell into its surroundings. Therefore, at these operating conditions, the cell undergoes reversible heating.",

It requires the derivation of a temperature profile from first principles, which is a standard and meaningful task in thermal engineering.\n\nThe physical system under consideration is a long solid cylinder of radius $R$ with uniform internal heat generation $q'''$ and constant thermal conductivity $k$. Heat transfer is one-dimensional in the radial direction, $r$. The governing equation for steady-state heat conduction in cylindrical coordinates with internal heat generation is derived from the principle of energy conservation.\n\nConsidering a cylindrical shell of infinitesimal thickness $dr$ at a radial position $r$ and of length $L$, the energy balance at steady state is:\n(Rate of heat conducted into the shell at $r$) + (Rate of heat generated within the shell) = (Rate of heat conducted out of the shell at $r+dr$).\n\nLet $q_r$ be the radial heat rate. The energy balance can be written as:\n$$ q_r + d\\dot{E}_{gen} = q_{r+dr} $$\nThe rate of heat generation within the differential volume $dV = (2\\pi r L) dr$ is $d\\dot{E}_{gen} = q''' (2\\pi r L dr)$.\nThe difference in heat rate across the shell is $q_{r+dr} - q_r = d_r q_r$. Thus:\n$$ d_r q_r = q''' (2\\pi r L dr) $$\nDividing by $dr$ and $L$ gives the change in heat rate per unit length:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( \\frac{q_r}{L} \\right) = 2\\pi r q''' $$\nThe radial heat rate $q_r$ is related to the heat flux $q''_r$ by $q_r = q''_r A_r = q''_r (2\\pi r L)$. Substituting this into the previous equation is not the most direct path. A more direct formulation from the general heat diffusion equation is preferred.\n\nThe general heat diffusion equation in cylindrical coordinates is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(k r \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi}\\left(k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\phi}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}\\right) + q''' = \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} $$\nApplying the problem's simplifying assumptions:\n1.  Steady state: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  Negligible end effects and no axial gradients: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z} = 0$.\n3.  Purely radial heat transfer implies azimuthal symmetry: $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$.\n4.  Spatially constant thermal conductivity $k$.\n\nThe equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(k r \\frac{dT}{dr}\\right) + q''' = 0 $$\nSince $k$ is constant, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{k}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dT}{dr}\\right) + q''' = 0 $$\nRearranging yields the governing ODE for the temperature profile $T(r)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dT}{dr}\\right) = -\\frac{q'''}{k} r $$\nWe solve this equation by integrating twice with respect to $r$. The first integration gives:\n$$ r \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\int \\frac{q'''}{k} r \\,dr = -\\frac{q'''}{2k} r^2 + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant. Dividing by $r$ gives the temperature gradient:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{q'''}{2k} r + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nThe second integration yields the general solution for the temperature profile:\n$$ T(r) = \\int \\left(-\\frac{q'''}{2k} r + \\frac{C_1}{r}\\right) dr = -\\frac{q'''}{4k} r^2 + C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second integration constant. The constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined from the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is the symmetry condition at the centerline of the cylinder ($r=0$). The temperature profile must be symmetric about the axis, which implies that the temperature gradient must be zero at $r=0$.\n$$ \\left.\\frac{dT}{dr}\\right|_{r=0} = 0 $$\nApplying this condition to the expression for the temperature gradient:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{q'''}{2k}(0) + \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nFor the right-hand side to be zero, the term $\\frac{C_1}{r}$ must not be singular. This is only possible if $C_1 = 0$. This also ensures that the temperature $T(r=0)$ is finite, as the $\\ln(r)$ term in the solution for $T(r)$ would otherwise diverge at $r=0$.\nWith $C_1=0$, the solution simplifies to:\n$$ T(r) = -\\frac{q'''}{4k} r^2 + C_2 $$\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{q'''}{2k} r $$\n\nThe second boundary condition is at the outer surface ($r=R$), where heat conducted to the surface is transferred to the ambient fluid via convection. The energy balance at the surface is:\n$$ q''_{\\text{conduction}} = q''_{\\text{convection}} $$\n$$ -k \\left.\\frac{dT}{dr}\\right|_{r=R} = h [T(R) - T_{\\infty}] $$\nSubstituting the expression for the temperature gradient at $r=R$:\n$$ -k \\left(-\\frac{q''' R}{2k}\\right) = h [T(R) - T_{\\infty}] $$\n$$ \\frac{q''' R}{2} = h [T(R) - T_{\\infty}] $$\nThis equation allows us to determine the surface temperature, $T(R)$:\n$$ T(R) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} $$\nNow we use this result to determine the constant $C_2$. From the simplified temperature profile, we evaluate it at $r=R$:\n$$ T(R) = -\\frac{q''' R^2}{4k} + C_2 $$\nEquating the two expressions for $T(R)$:\n$$ T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} = -\\frac{q''' R^2}{4k} + C_2 $$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} + \\frac{q''' R^2}{4k} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution for $T(r)$, we obtain the final closed-form temperature profile:\n$$ T(r) = -\\frac{q'''}{4k} r^2 + \\left( T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} + \\frac{q''' R^2}{4k} \\right) $$\nThis can be rearranged into a more interpretable form:\n$$ T(r) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} + \\frac{q'''}{4k} (R^2 - r^2) $$\nThis expression gives the temperature $T$ at any radial position $r$ within the cylinder.\n\nNext, we derive the core-to-surface temperature difference, $\\Delta T_{cs} \\equiv T(0) - T(R)$.\nThe core temperature, $T(0)$, is found by setting $r=0$ in the temperature profile:\n$$ T(0) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} + \\frac{q'''}{4k} (R^2 - 0) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} + \\frac{q''' R^2}{4k} $$\nThe surface temperature, $T(R)$, was previously determined as:\n$$ T(R) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} $$\nThe difference is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta T_{cs} = T(0) - T(R) = \\left( T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} + \\frac{q''' R^2}{4k} \\right) - \\left( T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q''' R}{2h} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta T_{cs} = \\frac{q''' R^2}{4k} $$\n\n**Interpretation of Parametric Dependence of $\\Delta T_{cs}$:**\nThe expression $\\Delta T_{cs} = \\frac{q''' R^2}{4k}$ reveals the following physical dependencies for the temperature drop within the solid cylinder:\n1.  **Heat Generation ($q'''$):** $\\Delta T_{cs}$ is directly proportional to $q'''$. A higher rate of internal heat generation leads to a steeper internal temperature gradient and a larger core-to-surface temperature difference.\n2.  **Radius ($R$):** $\\Delta T_{cs}$ is proportional to the square of the radius, $R^2$. This is a critical insight, indicating that the internal temperature rise is significantly more pronounced in larger-diameter cells. Doubling the radius quadruples this internal temperature difference, all else being equal.\n3.  **Thermal Conductivity ($k$):** $\\Delta T_{cs}$ is inversely proportional to $k$. A material with high thermal conductivity can more effectively conduct heat from the core to the surface, resulting in a smaller internal temperature difference.\n4.  **Convective Conditions ($h$, $T_{\\infty}$):** Notably, $\\Delta T_{cs}$ is independent of the convective heat transfer coefficient $h$ and the ambient temperature $T_{\\infty}$. These external parameters determine the temperature of the surface itself, $T(R)$, and thus shift the entire temperature profile up or down, but they do not affect the magnitude of the temperature difference between the core and the surface, which is solely a function of internal heat generation and conduction.\n\nThe two required expressions are the temperature profile $T(r)$ and the core-to-surface difference $\\Delta T_{cs}$.",

Multiplying the ODE by $I(t)$:\n$$\n\\exp(t/\\tau) \\frac{dT}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\exp(t/\\tau) T(t) = \\exp(t/\\tau) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau} T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q(t)}{\\rho c_p} \\right)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ T(t) \\exp(t/\\tau) \\right] = \\frac{T_{\\infty}}{\\tau} \\exp(t/\\tau) + \\frac{q(t)}{\\rho c_p} \\exp(t/\\tau)\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from $t'=0$ to $t'=t$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{d}{dt'} \\left[ T(t') \\exp(t'/\\tau) \\right] dt' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\left( \\frac{T_{\\infty}}{\\tau} \\exp(t'/\\tau) + \\frac{q(t')}{\\rho c_p} \\exp(t'/\\tau) \\right) dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\left[ T(t') \\exp(t'/\\tau) \\right]_0^t = T(t) \\exp(t/\\tau) - T(0) \\exp(0) = T(t) \\exp(t/\\tau) - T_0\n$$\nSo, we have:\n$$\nT(t) \\exp(t/\\tau) - T_0 = T_{\\infty} \\left[ \\exp(t'/\\tau) \\right]_0^t + \\frac{1}{\\rho c_p} \\int_0^t q(t') \\exp(t'/\\tau) dt'\n$$\n$$\nT(t) \\exp(t/\\tau) - T_0 = T_{\\infty} (\\exp(t/\\tau) - 1) + \\frac{1}{\\rho c_p} \\int_0^t q(t') \\exp(t'/\\tau) dt'\n$$\nSolving for $T(t)$:\n$$\nT(t) = T_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau) + T_{\\infty} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) + \\frac{\\exp(-t/\\tau)}{\\rho c_p} \\int_0^t q(t') \\exp(t'/\\tau) dt'\n$$\nThis is the general closed-form expression for $T(t)$ for an arbitrary heat generation rate $q(t)$.\n\n### Specific Solution for Step Input $q(t) = q_{0}$\n\nFor the case of a constant heat generation $q(t) = q_{0}$ for $t \\ge 0$, we evaluate the integral in the general solution:\n$$\n\\int_0^t q_0 \\exp(t'/\\tau) dt' = q_0 \\int_0^t \\exp(t'/\\tau) dt' = q_0 \\left[ \\tau \\exp(t'/\\tau) \\right]_0^t = q_0 \\tau (\\exp(t/\\tau) - 1)\n$$\nSubstitute this result back into the general expression for $T(t)$:\n$$\nT(t) = T_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau) + T_{\\infty} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) + \\frac{\\exp(-t/\\tau)}{\\rho c_p} \\left[ q_0 \\tau (\\exp(t/\\tau) - 1) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nT(t) = T_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau) + T_{\\infty} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) + \\frac{q_0 \\tau}{\\rho c_p} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau))\n$$\nNow, substitute the definition of the time constant $\\tau = \\frac{\\rho V c_p}{h A_s}$:\n$$\n\\frac{q_0 \\tau}{\\rho c_p} = \\frac{q_0}{\\rho c_p} \\left( \\frac{\\rho V c_p}{h A_s} \\right) = \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s}\n$$\nThe expression for $T(t)$ becomes:\n$$\nT(t) = T_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau) + T_{\\infty} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau)) + \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau))\n$$\nWe can collect terms with and without the exponential:\n$$\nT(t) = T_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau) + \\left( T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s} \\right) (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau))\n$$\n$$\nT(t) = T_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau) + T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s} - T_{\\infty} \\exp(-t/\\tau) - \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s} \\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\n$$\nT(t) = \\left( T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s} \\right) + \\left( T_0 - T_{\\infty} - \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s} \\right) \\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\nThis form clearly shows the steady-state temperature $T_{ss} = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s}$ and the transient decay. Finally, substituting the full expression for $\\tau$:\n$$\nT(t) = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s} + \\left(T_0 - T_{\\infty} - \\frac{q_0 V}{h A_s}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{h A_s t}{\\rho V c_p}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for $T(t)$ for the step input case.",
