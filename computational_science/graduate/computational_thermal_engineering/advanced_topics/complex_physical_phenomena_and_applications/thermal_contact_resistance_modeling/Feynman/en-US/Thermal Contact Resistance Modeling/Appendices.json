It is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution to the specified temperature difference.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the layer-wise temperature fields, the interfacial temperature jump, and the total outer-surface temperature difference for a composite slab under steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction.\n\nThe governing equation for steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction with no internal heat generation is derived from the energy balance:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} q''(x) = 0 $$\nwhere $q''(x)$ is the local heat flux. This equation implies that the heat flux $q''(x)$ is constant throughout the slab. The problem specifies a uniform heat flux $q''$ entering at $x=0$ and exiting at $x=L_{1}+L_{2}$, so we have $q''(x) = q''$ for all $x$ in the domain $0 \\le x \\le L_{1}+L_{2}$.\n\nThe relationship between heat flux and temperature gradient is given by Fourier's law of heat conduction:\n$$ q''(x) = -k \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity.\n\n**Layer 1: $0 \\le x \\le L_{1}$**\nIn this layer, the thermal conductivity is a constant $k_{1}$. Applying Fourier's law:\n$$ q'' = -k_{1} \\frac{dT_{1}}{dx} $$\nSince $q''$ and $k_{1}$ are constants, the temperature gradient is also constant:\n$$ \\frac{dT_{1}}{dx} = -\\frac{q''}{k_{1}} $$\nThis is the first required result. Integrating with respect to $x$ yields the temperature field $T_{1}(x)$:\n$$ T_{1}(x) = -\\frac{q''}{k_{1}}x + C_{1} $$\nwhere $C_{1}$ is an arbitrary integration constant.

Applying Fourier's law:\n$$ q'' = -k_{2} \\frac{dT_{2}}{dx} $$\nThe temperature gradient in this layer is constant as well:\n$$ \\frac{dT_{2}}{dx} = -\\frac{q''}{k_{2}} $$\nThis is the second required result for the gradients.

Temperature drop across the interface at $x=L_{1}$:\n    This is the interfacial temperature jump we already derived:\n    $$ T_{1}(L_{1}) - T_{2}(L_{1}) = q'' R_{c} $$\n3.  Temperature drop across layer 2 ($L_{1} \\le x \\le L_{1}+L_{2}$):\n    $$ T_{2}(L_{1}) - T_{2}(L_{1}+L_{2}) = \\left(-\\frac{q''}{k_{2}}L_{1} + C_{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{q''}{k_{2}}(L_{1}+L_{2}) + C_{2}\\right) = -\\frac{q''L_{1}}{k_{2}} + \\frac{q''}{k_{2}}(L_{1}+L_{2}) = \\frac{q''L_{2}}{k_{2}} $$\n\nSumming these three temperature drops gives the total temperature difference:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{q''L_{1}}{k_{1}} + q''R_{c} + \\frac{q''L_{2}}{k_{2}} $$\nFactoring out the constant heat flux $q''$ gives the final expression:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\text{out}} = q'' \\left( \\frac{L_{1}}{k_{1}} + R_{c} + \\frac{L_{2}}{k_{2}} \\right) $$\nThis expression is solely in terms of the parameters specified in the problem statement.

This can be expressed as $Q_{i \\to i+1} = \\frac{T_i - T_{i+1}}{R_{\\mathrm{cond}}}$, where $R_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{k A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}$ is the thermal resistance between the nodes.\n\n1.  **Interior Node in Slab 1 ($0 < i < N_1-1$)**:\n    The energy balance for the control volume around node $i$ is $Q_{i-1 \\to i} + Q_{i+1 \\to i} = 0$.\n    $$ \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_{i-1} - T_i) + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_{i+1} - T_i) = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_{i-1} - \\frac{2 k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_i + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_{i+1} = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Interior Node in Slab 2 ($N_1 < i < N-1$)**:\n    Similarly, for a node in slab $2$:\n    $$ \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{i-1} - \\frac{2 k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_i + \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{i+1} = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Interface Nodes ($i = N_1-1$ and $i = N_1$)**:\n    The thermal path between node $N_1-1$ and $N_1$ consists of three resistances in series: half a control volume in slab 1, the contact resistance, and half a control volume in slab 2.\n    - Resistance from node $N_1-1$ to the physical interface: $R_1 = \\frac{\\Delta x_1 / 2}{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}$.\n    - Contact resistance (effective over area $A_{\\mathrm{cs}}$): $R_{\\mathrm{contact,eff}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}$.\n    - Resistance from the physical interface to node $N_1$: $R_2 = \\frac{\\Delta x_2 / 2}{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}$.\n    The total effective resistance between the nodes is $R_{\\mathrm{int,eff}} = R_1 + R_{\\mathrm{contact,eff}} + R_2$.\n    The corresponding thermal conductance is $G_{\\mathrm{int}} = 1 / R_{\\mathrm{int,eff}}$.\n    The heat transfer rate between these nodes is $Q_{\\mathrm{int}} = G_{\\mathrm{int}} (T_{N_1-1} - T_{N_1})$.\n\n    - **Energy Balance for Node $N_1-1$**:\n      Heat from node $N_1-2$ plus heat from node $N_1$ must sum to zero.\n      $$ \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_{N_1-2} - T_{N_1-1}) + G_{\\mathrm{int}}(T_{N_1} - T_{N_1-1}) = 0 $$\n      $$ \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_{N_1-2} - \\left(\\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} + G_{\\mathrm{int}}\\right) T_{N_1-1} + G_{\\mathrm{int}} T_{N_1} = 0 $$\n\n    - **Energy Balance for Node $N_1$**:\n      Heat from node $N_1-1$ plus heat from node $N_1+1$ must sum to zero.\n      $$ G_{\\mathrm{int}}(T_{N_1-1} - T_{N_1}) + \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2}(T_{N_1+1} - T_{N_1}) = 0 $$\n      $$ G_{\\mathrm{int}} T_{N_1-1} - \\left(G_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2}\\right) T_{N_1} + \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{N_1+1} = 0 $$\n\n4.  **Boundary Nodes ($i=0$ and $i=N-1$)**:\n    We consider a control volume of half-width $\\Delta x_1/2$ at the left boundary and $\\Delta x_2/2$ at the right.\n\n    - **Left Boundary ($i=0$)**:\n      - **Dirichlet**: The temperature is specified.\n        $$ T_0 = T_L $$\n      - **Neumann**: A heat flux $q_L$ (positive into the domain) is applied.\n        $$ q_L A_{\\mathrm{cs}} + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_1 - T_0) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_0 + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_1 = -q_L A_{\\mathrm{cs}} $$\n      - **Robin**: Convective heat transfer with ambient $T_\\infty$ and coefficient $h$.\n        $$ h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} (T_\\infty - T_0) + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_1 - T_0) = 0 \\implies -\\left(h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}\\right)T_0 + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_1 = -h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} T_\\infty $$\n\n    - **Right Boundary ($i=N-1$)**:\n      - **Dirichlet**: The temperature is specified.\n        $$ T_{N-1} = T_R $$\n      - **Neumann**: A heat flux $q_R$ (positive into the domain) is applied.\n        $$ \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2}(T_{N-2} - T_{N-1}) + q_R A_{\\mathrm{cs}} = 0 \\implies \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{N-2} - \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{N-1} = -q_R A_{\\mathrm{cs}} $$\n      - **Robin**: Convective heat transfer.\n        $$ \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2}(T_{N-2} - T_{N-1}) + h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} (T_\\infty - T_{N-1}) = 0 \\implies \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{N-2} - \\left(\\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} + h A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\right) T_{N-1} = -h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} T_\\infty $$\n\nThese $N$ linear algebraic equations form a system $[A]\\{T\\} = \\{b\\}$, which can be solved for the nodal temperature vector $\\{T\\}$.\n\n### Calculation of Interfacial Temperature Jump $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{c}}$\n\nOnce the nodal temperatures are found, the steady-state heat rate $Q$ through the system can be calculated. For steady state with no generation, $Q$ is constant. We can calculate it based on the temperature difference between any two adjacent nodes. For robustness, if the left boundary is not Neumann, we use the first two nodes:\n$$ Q = \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_0 - T_1) $$\nIf the left boundary is Neumann with flux $q_L$, the heat rate is simply:\n$$ Q = q_L A_{\\mathrm{cs}} $$\nThe interfacial heat flux is $q_{\\mathrm{int}} = Q / A_{\\mathrm{cs}}$. The temperature jump across the contact resistance is then calculated as:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{c}} = |q_{\\mathrm{int}} R_{\\mathrm{c}}| $$\nThe absolute value ensures the result is non-negative as required.",
