I will proceed with deriving the numerical model and implementing the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Finite Volume Discretization\n\nWe will use a finite volume method. The domain is divided into $N=N_1+N_2$ control volumes, each centered around a node $T_i$. For steady-state, one-dimensional conduction with no heat generation, the energy balance for any control volume is that the net rate of heat entering the volume is zero.\n\nThe nodes are indexed from $i=0$ to $N-1$.\n- Nodes $i=0, \\dots, N_1-1$ are in slab $1$.\n- Nodes $i=N_1, \\dots, N-1$ are in slab $2$.\nThe interface is located between node $N_1-1$ and node $N_1$.\nThe node spacings are $\\Delta x_1 = L_1 / (N_1-1)$ for slab $1$ and $\\Delta x_2 = L_2 / (N_2-1)$ for slab $2$.\n\nThe heat transfer rate $Q$ between two adjacent nodes $T_i$ and $T_{i+1}$ within a homogeneous material is given by Fourier's law, approximated as:\n$Q_{i \\to i+1} = \\frac{k A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x} (T_i - T_{i+1})$. This can be expressed as $Q_{i \\to i+1} = \\frac{T_i - T_{i+1}}{R_{\\mathrm{cond}}}$, where $R_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{k A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}$ is the thermal resistance between the nodes.\n\n1.  **Interior Node in Slab 1 ($0  i  N_1-1$)**:\n    The energy balance for the control volume around node $i$ is $Q_{i-1 \\to i} + Q_{i+1 \\to i} = 0$.\n    $$ \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_{i-1} - T_i) + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_{i+1} - T_i) = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_{i-1} - \\frac{2 k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_i + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_{i+1} = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Interior Node in Slab 2 ($N_1  i  N-1$)**:\n    Similarly, for a node in slab $2$:\n    $$ \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{i-1} - \\frac{2 k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_i + \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{i+1} = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Interface Nodes ($i = N_1-1$ and $i = N_1$)**:\n    The thermal path between node $N_1-1$ and $N_1$ consists of three resistances in series: half a control volume in slab 1, the contact resistance, and half a control volume in slab 2.\n    - Resistance from node $N_1-1$ to the physical interface: $R_1 = \\frac{\\Delta x_1 / 2}{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}$.\n    - Contact resistance (effective over area $A_{\\mathrm{cs}}$): $R_{\\mathrm{contact,eff}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{c}}}{A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}$.\n    - Resistance from the physical interface to node $N_1$: $R_2 = \\frac{\\Delta x_2 / 2}{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}$.\n    The total effective resistance between the nodes is $R_{\\mathrm{int,eff}} = R_1 + R_{\\mathrm{contact,eff}} + R_2$.\n    The corresponding thermal conductance is $G_{\\mathrm{int}} = 1 / R_{\\mathrm{int,eff}}$.\n    The heat transfer rate between these nodes is $Q_{\\mathrm{int}} = G_{\\mathrm{int}} (T_{N_1-1} - T_{N_1})$.\n\n    - **Energy Balance for Node $N_1-1$**:\n      Heat from node $N_1-2$ plus heat from node $N_1$ must sum to zero.\n      $$ \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_{N_1-2} - T_{N_1-1}) + G_{\\mathrm{int}}(T_{N_1} - T_{N_1-1}) = 0 $$\n      $$ \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_{N_1-2} - \\left(\\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} + G_{\\mathrm{int}}\\right) T_{N_1-1} + G_{\\mathrm{int}} T_{N_1} = 0 $$\n\n    - **Energy Balance for Node $N_1$**:\n      Heat from node $N_1-1$ plus heat from node $N_1+1$ must sum to zero.\n      $$ G_{\\mathrm{int}}(T_{N_1-1} - T_{N_1}) + \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2}(T_{N_1+1} - T_{N_1}) = 0 $$\n      $$ G_{\\mathrm{int}} T_{N_1-1} - \\left(G_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2}\\right) T_{N_1} + \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{N_1+1} = 0 $$\n\n4.  **Boundary Nodes ($i=0$ and $i=N-1$)**:\n    We consider a control volume of half-width $\\Delta x_1/2$ at the left boundary and $\\Delta x_2/2$ at the right.\n\n    - **Left Boundary ($i=0$)**:\n      - **Dirichlet**: The temperature is specified.\n        $$ T_0 = T_L $$\n      - **Neumann**: A heat flux $q_L$ (positive into the domain) is applied.\n        $$ q_L A_{\\mathrm{cs}} + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_1 - T_0) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_0 + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_1 = -q_L A_{\\mathrm{cs}} $$\n      - **Robin**: Convective heat transfer with ambient $T_\\infty$ and coefficient $h$.\n        $$ h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} (T_\\infty - T_0) + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_1 - T_0) = 0 \\implies -\\left(h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}\\right)T_0 + \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1} T_1 = -h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} T_\\infty $$\n\n    - **Right Boundary ($i=N-1$)**:\n      - **Dirichlet**: The temperature is specified.\n        $$ T_{N-1} = T_R $$\n      - **Neumann**: A heat flux $q_R$ (positive into the domain) is applied.\n        $$ \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2}(T_{N-2} - T_{N-1}) + q_R A_{\\mathrm{cs}} = 0 \\implies \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{N-2} - \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{N-1} = -q_R A_{\\mathrm{cs}} $$\n      - **Robin**: Convective heat transfer.\n        $$ \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2}(T_{N-2} - T_{N-1}) + h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} (T_\\infty - T_{N-1}) = 0 \\implies \\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} T_{N-2} - \\left(\\frac{k_2 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_2} + h A_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\right) T_{N-1} = -h A_{\\mathrm{cs}} T_\\infty $$\n\nThese $N$ linear algebraic equations form a system $[A]\\{T\\} = \\{b\\}$, which can be solved for the nodal temperature vector $\\{T\\}$.\n\n### Calculation of Interfacial Temperature Jump $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{c}}$\n\nOnce the nodal temperatures are found, the steady-state heat rate $Q$ through the system can be calculated. For steady state with no generation, $Q$ is constant. We can calculate it based on the temperature difference between any two adjacent nodes. For robustness, if the left boundary is not Neumann, we use the first two nodes:\n$$ Q = \\frac{k_1 A_{\\mathrm{cs}}}{\\Delta x_1}(T_0 - T_1) $$\nIf the left boundary is Neumann with flux $q_L$, the heat rate is simply:\n$$ Q = q_L A_{\\mathrm{cs}} $$\nThe interfacial heat flux is $q_{\\mathrm{int}} = Q / A_{\\mathrm{cs}}$. The temperature jump across the contact resistance is then calculated as:\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{c}} = |q_{\\mathrm{int}} R_{\\mathrm{c}}| $$\nThe absolute value ensures the result is non-negative as required.",
