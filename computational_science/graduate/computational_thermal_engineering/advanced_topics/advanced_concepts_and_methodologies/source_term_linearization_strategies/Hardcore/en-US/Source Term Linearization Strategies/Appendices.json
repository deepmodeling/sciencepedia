We will see how a convective heat transfer boundary, governed by Newton's law of cooling, is incorporated into the Finite Volume Method framework not as a boundary value itself, but as a linearized source term for the adjacent control volume. This exercise  demonstrates how to derive the linearization coefficients $S_C$ and $S_P$ and correctly modify the algebraic equation, a fundamental skill in computational heat transfer.",

            "problem": "Consider a steady one-dimensional heat conduction problem in a solid discretized by the Finite Volume Method (FVM). Let the control volume adjacent to a boundary face $f$ have center temperature $T_{P}$, face area $A_{f}$, and be subject to a convective (Robin-type) boundary condition given by Newton’s law of cooling, namely that the heat flux at the boundary is $q'' = h\\left(T_{w} - T_{\\infty}\\right)$, where $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, $T_{w}$ is the wall temperature, and $T_{\\infty}$ is the ambient temperature. Assume that the face $f$ exchanges heat with the environment such that the net heat flow across $f$ entering or leaving the control volume can be written in terms of the control-volume temperature $T_{P}$ and known data.\n\nStarting from energy conservation over the control volume and Newton's law of cooling, recast the convective boundary contribution at face $f$ into the standard linearized source form $S = S_{C} + S_{P} T_{P}$ prescribed in source term linearization strategies.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer and computational fluid dynamics, well-posed, and objective. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe foundation of the Finite Volume Method (FVM) is the conservation of a physical quantity over a control volume. For a steady-state heat transfer problem, this means the net rate of heat energy entering the control volume is zero. The energy balance for the control volume $P$ adjacent to the boundary face $f$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} Q_{i} + S_{\\text{vol}} \\Delta V = 0\n$$\nwhere $Q_{i}$ is the net heat flow rate across face $i$, $S_{\\text{vol}}$ is a volumetric heat source, and $\\Delta V$ is the volume of the control volume. In this problem, we are concerned only with the contribution from the convective boundary at face $f$. The heat flow across this face, $Q_f$, is treated as a source term for the control volume cell.\n\nAccording to Newton's law of cooling, the heat flux (heat flow rate per unit area) from the wall surface at temperature $T_w$ to the ambient environment at temperature $T_{\\infty}$ is given by:\n$$\nq'' = h (T_{w} - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient. By convention in FVM, heat flow *into* the control volume is considered positive. Therefore, the heat flow rate into the control volume through face $f$ is:\n$$\nQ_{f} = -q'' A_{f} = -h A_{f} (T_{w} - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nwhere $A_{f}$ is the area of the boundary face $f$.\n\nTo incorporate this heat flow into the discretized algebraic equation for the cell-centered temperature $T_P$, we must express the wall temperature $T_w$ in terms of the nodal temperatures. For a boundary control volume in a solid, a standard and necessary approximation is to assume the temperature at the wall face is equal to the temperature at the center of the control volume:\n$$\nT_w \\approx T_P\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $Q_f$, we obtain the heat source contribution from the boundary:\n$$\nS = Q_{f} = -h A_{f} (T_P - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nThis source term $S$ depends on the unknown variable $T_P$. To maintain the linear structure of the final algebraic system, this term must be linearized into the standard form $S = S_C + S_P T_P$. By rearranging the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = h A_{f} T_{\\infty} - h A_{f} T_P\n$$\nComparing this with the linearized form $S = S_C + S_P T_P$, we can identify the components:\n$$\nS_C = h A_{f} T_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\nS_P = -h A_{f}\n$$\nThe general practice for source term linearization requires that the coefficient $S_P$ must be less than or equal to zero ($S_P \\le 0$). This ensures that when the term $S_P T_P$ is moved to the left-hand side of the algebraic equation, it adds a positive value to the main diagonal coefficient $a_P$, thus reinforcing diagonal dominance and promoting stability of the numerical solution. Since $h$ and $A_f$ are physical quantities that must be positive, our derived $S_P = -h A_f$ is indeed negative, satisfying this crucial condition.\n\nThe general form of the discretized algebraic equation for cell $P$ is:\n$$\na_P T_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + b_P\n$$\nwhere $a_{nb}$ are the coefficients for neighboring cells, and $b_P$ is the constant part of the source term. Before accounting for the boundary source, let the equation be $a_P^0 T_P = \\sum a_{nb} T_{nb} + b_P^0$. The total source term, including the linearized boundary contribution, is added to the right-hand side:\n$$\na_P^0 T_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + b_P^0 + S = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + b_P^0 + S_C + S_P T_P\n$$\nTo restore the standard form, we move the term containing $T_P$ to the left-hand side:\n$$\n(a_P^0 - S_P) T_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + (b_P^0 + S_C)\n$$\nThe new diagonal coefficient is $a_P = a_P^0 - S_P$, and the new constant source part is $b_P = b_P^0 + S_C$.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical contributions, $\\Delta a_P$ and $\\Delta b_P$, that must be added to the coefficients due solely to the convective boundary. These are the changes from the baseline values ($a_P^0$, $b_P^0$) that do not include the boundary effect.\nThe change in the diagonal coefficient is:\n$$\n\\Delta a_P = a_P - a_P^0 = -S_P\n$$\nThe change in the constant source term is:\n$$\n\\Delta b_P = b_P - b_P^0 = S_C\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_C$ and $S_P$:\n$$\n\\Delta a_P = -(-h A_{f}) = h A_{f}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta b_P = h A_{f} T_{\\infty}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $h = 100\\,\\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-2} \\cdot K^{-1}}$, $A_{f} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, and $T_{\\infty} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe numerical contribution to the diagonal coefficient $a_P$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta a_P = (100\\,\\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-2} \\cdot K^{-1}}) \\times (0.01\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) = 1\\,\\mathrm{W \\cdot K^{-1}}\n$$\nThe numerical contribution to the constant source term $b_P$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta b_P = (100\\,\\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-2} \\cdot K^{-1}}) \\times (0.01\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 1 \\times 300\\,\\mathrm{W} = 300\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nThe final answer is the pair of values $(\\Delta a_P, \\Delta b_P)$.",

The local energy conservation law can be written in terms of the temperature $T$ as $$\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T) + S(T),$$ where $\\rho$ is density, $c$ is specific heat capacity, $k$ is thermal conductivity, and $S(T)$ is the volumetric heat source.

To treat the nonlinearity in $S(T)$, you intend to linearize the source in the standard form $$S(T) \\approx S_C + S_P \\, T,$$ where $S_C$ and $S_P$ are coefficients to be determined at each iteration, with $S_C$ assembled into the right-hand side and $S_P$ assembled into the coefficient of the unknown temperature. For numerical boundedness and physical realism (avoiding nonphysical overshoots and preserving monotonicity), a common guideline is to enforce a sign condition on $S_P$.\n\nAnalyze the sign of $S_P$ appropriate for exothermic sources in the fully implicit FVM discretization, and explain how to recast $S(T)$ into $S_C + S_P T$ in a way that enforces the required sign while preserving physical behavior (e.g., matching the true source at a chosen reference temperature and keeping the source non-negative for exothermic mechanisms).

For exothermic sources with $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}  0$, setting $S_P = 0$ and taking $S_C = S(T^{*})$, where $T^{*}$ is a lagged or previously computed temperature, is a safe choice that enforces the sign condition on $S_P$ and preserves boundedness in the implicit discretization.\n\nB.

The governing equation is the standard energy conservation equation. Source term linearization is a critical and well-established technique for handling non-linearities in numerical simulations. The Arrhenius model is a standard representation of chemical heat release. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The question asks for an analysis and evaluation of different numerical strategies, not a solution to a specific boundary value problem. The context is clearly defined, and the criteria for evaluation (boundedness, physical realism) are standard in the field. The problem is well-posed.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n4.  **Complete/Consistent:** The problem provides all necessary information to analyze the numerical stability implications of source term linearization. There are no contradictions.\n5.  **Realistic:** The scenario described is a common challenge faced by engineers and scientists implementing numerical models for systems with reactive or radiative sources.\n6.  **Other Flaws:** The problem is not trivial, metaphorical, or unverifiable. It addresses a core concept in advanced numerical modeling.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in computational thermal engineering. I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation of the options.\n\n### Derivation of the Sign Condition for `$S_P$`\n\nThe fully implicit FVM discretization of the governing equation for a single control volume `$P$` of volume `$V$` is:\n$$ \\rho c \\frac{T_P - T_P^0}{\\Delta t} V = \\sum_{nb} \\frac{k_{nb} A_{nb}}{d_{nb}} (T_{nb} - T_P) + \\int_V S(T) dV $$\nwhere `$T_P$` is the unknown temperature at the current time step, `$T_P^0$` is the temperature at the previous time step, `$\\Delta t$` is the time step size, and the sum is over all neighboring control volumes (`$nb$`). `$A_{nb}$` is the face area and `$d_{nb}$` is the distance between cell centers.\n\nLinearizing the source term as `$\\int_V S(T) dV \\approx (S_C + S_P T_P) V$`, we substitute this into the equation:\n$$ \\rho c \\frac{T_P - T_P^0}{\\Delta t} V = \\sum_{nb} \\frac{k_{nb} A_{nb}}{d_{nb}} (T_{nb} - T_P) + (S_C + S_P T_P) V $$\nTo obtain the standard linear algebraic form, `$a_P T_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + b$`, we rearrange the terms, moving all terms with the unknown `$T_P$` to the left-hand side and all other terms to the right-hand side:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\rho c V}{\\Delta t} + \\sum_{nb} \\frac{k_{nb} A_{nb}}{d_{nb}} - S_P V \\right) T_P = \\left( \\sum_{nb} \\frac{k_{nb} A_{nb}}{d_{nb}} T_{nb} \\right) + \\frac{\\rho c V}{\\Delta t} T_P^0 + S_C V $$\nWe can identify the coefficients:\n$$ a_{nb} = \\frac{k_{nb} A_{nb}}{d_{nb}} $$\n$$ a_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} + \\frac{\\rho c V}{\\Delta t} - S_P V $$\n$$ b = \\frac{\\rho c V}{\\Delta t} T_P^0 + S_C V $$\n\nFor a numerical scheme to be bounded (i.e., to prevent unphysical oscillations and ensure solutions remain within physical bounds) and for iterative matrix solvers to converge reliably, the resulting system of linear equations must satisfy certain properties, most commonly diagonal dominance. The Scarborough criterion for an irreducible matrix to be diagonally dominant requires `$a_P  0$` for all equations and `$a_P \\ge \\sum_{nb} |a_{nb}|$`. In the FVM, the neighbor coefficients `$a_{nb}$` are positive (since `$k, A, d  0$`). The transient term coefficient `$\\frac{\\rho c V}{\\Delta t}$` is also positive.\n\nThe requirement for boundedness in the FVM context is often simplified to ensuring that all coefficients `$a_{nb}$` are non-negative and that the main coefficient `$a_P$` satisfies `$a_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} + a'_P$`, where `$a'_P \\ge 0$`. In our case:\n$$ a_P = \\left( \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\rho c V}{\\Delta t} - S_P V \\right) $$\nTo satisfy the condition, we must have `$\\frac{\\rho c V}{\\Delta t} - S_P V \\ge 0$`. Since `$\\frac{\\rho c V}{\\Delta t} \\ge 0$`, this condition is most robustly guaranteed if the source term part `$-S_P V$` is non-negative. As `$V  0$`, this implies:\n$$ -S_P \\ge 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad S_P \\le 0 $$\nA choice of `$S_P \\le 0$` increases (or leaves unchanged) the magnitude of the main diagonal coefficient `$a_P$`, thereby strengthening diagonal dominance and promoting stability and boundedness. Conversely, a choice of `$S_P  0$` would decrease `$a_P$`, potentially making it negative and violating diagonal dominance, leading to numerical instability and divergence. This is particularly dangerous for exothermic sources where `$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}  0$`, as it creates a destabilizing positive feedback in the numerical scheme.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental guideline for linearizing a source term in this context is to ensure `$S_P \\le 0$`.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For exothermic sources with `$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}  0$`, setting `$S_P = 0$` and taking `$S_C = S(T^{*})$`, where `$T^{*}$` is a lagged or previously computed temperature, is a safe choice that enforces the sign condition on `$S_P$` and preserves boundedness in the implicit discretization.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option proposes setting `$S_P = 0$`. This choice satisfies the derived condition `$S_P \\le 0$`. With `$S_P = 0$`, the source term `$-S_P V$` makes a zero contribution to the diagonal coefficient `$a_P$`, thus leaving the diagonal dominance of the base (source-free) scheme intact. The entire source term `$S(T^{*})$` is treated explicitly, i.e., moved to the right-hand side source vector `$b$`. While this explicit treatment can have limitations for stiff sources (requiring small time steps for stability/accuracy), it correctly adheres to the boundedness criterion. It is a \"safe\" and simple choice.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Choosing `$S_P = \\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T^{*}}  0$` improves convergence and preserves boundedness because it captures temperature sensitivity in the implicit coefficient.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** For the given exothermic sources, `$S(T)$` increases with `$T$`, so `$\\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T^{*}}  0$`. This choice means `$S_P  0$`. As derived, a positive `$S_P$` violates the condition `$S_P \\le 0$`. It subtracts from the main diagonal coefficient `$a_P$`, reducing diagonal dominance and potentially making `$a_P$` negative. This is the recipe for numerical instability and divergence, not for preserving boundedness. This choice is fundamentally incorrect for the standard FVM formulation.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A physically preserving recast is `$$S_C = S(T^{*}) - S_P \\, T^{*}, \\quad S_P = -\\beta,$$` with `$\\beta \\ge 0$` chosen by the user. This both matches the exact source at `$T^{*}$` and enforces `$S_P \\le 0$`. For exothermic sources with `$S(T^{*}) \\ge 0$`, it keeps the effective source non-negative in the linearized model for temperatures near `$T^{*}$`.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The proposal is `$S_P = -\\beta$` where `$\\beta \\ge 0$`. This directly enforces the condition `$S_P \\le 0$`. The construction `$S_C = S(T^{*}) - S_P T^{*}$` ensures that the linearized source, `$S_{\\text{lin}}(T) = S_C + S_P T = (S(T^{*}) - S_P T^{*}) + S_P T = S(T^{*}) + S_P(T - T^{*})$`, evaluates to `$S(T^{*})$` at `$T = T^{*}$`. This is a desirable property, making the approximation a first-order Taylor expansion in its structure but with a modified slope `$S_P$`. The statement that it keeps the source non-negative near `$T^{*}$` is also correct, as `$S(T^{*}) \\ge 0$` and the change `$S_P(T - T^{*})$` is small for `$T \\approx T^{*}$`. This is a general and correct procedure for implementing the source term linearization while respecting numerical stability constraints.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**D. For an Arrhenius exothermic source `$$S(T) = \\rho Q A \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E}{R T}\\right),$$` one can enforce `$S_P \\le 0$` while still capturing stiffness by taking `$$S_P = -\\theta \\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T^{*}}, \\quad S_C = S(T^{*}) - S_P T^{*}, \\quad 0 \\le \\theta \\le 1.$$` This damps the nonlinearity, increases the diagonal coefficient of the linear system, and preserves boundedness of the implicit solve.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This is a specific application of the principle from option C. For the Arrhenius source, `$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T} = S(T) \\frac{E}{RT^2}  0$`. The proposed `$S_P = -\\theta \\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T^{*}}$` with `$0 \\le \\theta \\le 1$` ensures that `$S_P \\le 0$`. The contribution to the diagonal coefficient is `$-S_P V = \\theta \\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T^{*}} V \\ge 0$`, which *increases* the diagonal coefficient `$a_P$`, enhancing stability and boundedness. The factor `$\\theta$` acts as a \"damping\" or under-relaxation factor. `$\\theta = 0$` recovers the explicit method (Option A). `$\\theta = 1$` would correspond to a Newton-like linearization term (with the sign flipped for stability), which may be too aggressive for highly nonlinear sources. Using `$0  \\theta  1$` provides a robust way to add implicitness and stabilize the solution without causing overshoots. The construction `$S_C = S(T^{*}) - S_P T^{*}$` is consistent as before. This is an advanced, correct, and practical strategy.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**E. To preserve physical behavior for exothermic sources, `$S_P$` must be strictly negative (i.e., `$S_P  0$`); choosing `$S_P = 0$` is physically inconsistent and leads to energy non-conservation in the discretization.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The condition for boundedness is `$S_P \\le 0$`, which includes `$S_P = 0$`. Therefore, the claim that `$S_P$` must be *strictly* negative is false. As analyzed in A, `$S_P = 0$` is a valid choice. The claim that `$S_P=0$` is \"physically inconsistent\" is also incorrect; it represents a valid zero-order approximation `$S(T) \\approx S(T^{*})$`. Most importantly, the claim that it \"leads to energy non-conservation\" is fundamentally wrong. The Finite Volume Method is derived by integrating the conservation law over a control volume, making it inherently conservative. The linearization is a mathematical technique used to solve the resulting algebraic equations at each time step/iteration. It influences the path to the solution and its stability, not the conservative nature of the underlying discretization framework.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

Substituting the expression for $h(T)$:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (c\\,T + L\\,f(T)) = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T)\n$$\nAssuming constant specific heat $c$, we can expand the time derivative:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\rho L \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T)\n$$\nTo solve for temperature $T$, it is standard practice to treat the latent heat term as a source or sink. Rearranging the equation to isolate the transient term for temperature:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T) - \\rho L \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe problem defines the latent heat source term as $S(T) \\equiv \\rho\\,L\\,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}$. Therefore, this term acts as a sink in the temperature equation, entering with a negative sign. The total source term in the temperature equation is $S_{\\text{eff}} = -S(T)$.\n\nFor a fully implicit time discretization, all terms are evaluated at the new time level, $n+1$. The time derivative is approximated using a first-order backward difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{T^{n+1} - T^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nAnd similarly for the liquid fraction derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{f(T^{n+1}) - f(T^n)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe effective source term at time $n+1$ is thus approximated as:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1} = -\\rho L \\frac{f(T^{n+1}) - f(T^n)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThis expression is non-linear in the unknown temperature $T^{n+1}$ because $f$ is a function of $T^{n+1}$. To incorporate this into a linear system of algebraic equations, we must linearize it. The problem specifies linearization about the previous time level temperature, $T^n$, into the form $S_P T^{n+1} + S_C$.\nThis is achieved by using a first-order Taylor series expansion of $f(T^{n+1})$ around $T^n$:\n$$\nf(T^{n+1}) \\approx f(T^n) + \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n (T^{n+1} - T^n)\n$$\nwhere $\\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n$ is the derivative of the liquid fraction with respect to temperature, evaluated at $T^n$.\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the expression for $S_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1}$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1} \\approx -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left[ \\left( f(T^n) + \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n (T^{n+1} - T^n) \\right) - f(T^n) \\right]\n$$\nThe $f(T^n)$ terms cancel out:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1} \\approx -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n (T^{n+1} - T^n) \\right]\n$$\nRearranging this into the desired linearized form $S_P T^{n+1} + S_C$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1} \\approx \\left[ -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n \\right] T^{n+1} + \\left[ \\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n T^n \\right]\n$$\nBy comparing this with the target form, we identify the coefficients $S_P$ and $S_C$:\n$$\nS_P = -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n\n$$\n$$\nS_C = \\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n T^n = -S_P T^n\n$$\nThe problem provides the explicit constraint that $S_P \\le 0$. Since $\\rho$, $L$, and $\\Delta t$ are all positive, this requires $\\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n \\ge 0$. As temperature increases during melting, the liquid fraction $f$ increases, so this condition is physically consistent. Our derivation correctly yields a negative $S_P$, satisfying this fundamental requirement for numerical stability in the FVM.\n\nThe first part of the task is to provide the closed-form expression for $S_P$ in terms of the given parameters. This is:\n$$\nS_P = -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\frac{df}{dT}\n$$\nNote that we drop the superscript $n$ on the derivative because, for the given model, it is constant within the phase-change interval.\n\nThe second part is to evaluate $S_P$ numerically. The liquid fraction is given as $f(T) = \\dfrac{T-T_s}{T_l-T_s}$ in the phase-change interval $T \\in [T_s, T_l]$.\nThe derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dT} = \\frac{1}{T_l - T_s}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S_P$:\n$$\nS_P = -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t (T_l - T_s)}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\rho = 900\\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^{-3}}$\n$L = 2 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot kg^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta t = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$T_s = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$T_l = 350\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe temperature difference is $T_l - T_s = 350\\,\\mathrm{K} - 300\\,\\mathrm{K} = 50\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\n$$\nS_P = -\\frac{(900\\,\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^{-3}}) \\times (2 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot kg^{-1}})}{(0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times (50\\,\\mathrm{K})}\n$$\n$$\nS_P = -\\frac{1.8 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot m^{-3}}}{5\\,\\mathrm{s \\cdot K}}\n$$\n$$\nS_P = -0.36 \\times 10^8\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{s \\cdot m^3 \\cdot K}}\n$$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{J/s} = 1\\,\\mathrm{W}$, the units are $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}\\,K^{-1}}$, as required.\n$$\nS_P = -3.6 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nS_P = -3.60 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}\\,K^{-1}}\n$$\nThis is the final numerical value for the coefficient $S_P$.",
