This exercise demonstrates how to convert a physical law at a boundary—in this case, Newton's law of cooling—into the standard linearized form $S = S_C + S_P T_P$. By working through this fundamental example , you will see how boundary conditions directly modify the main diagonal and source vector of your linear system and understand why the resulting linearization naturally enhances numerical stability.",

            "problem": "Consider a steady one-dimensional heat conduction problem in a solid discretized by the Finite Volume Method (FVM). Let the control volume adjacent to a boundary face $f$ have center temperature $T_{P}$, face area $A_{f}$, and be subject to a convective (Robin-type) boundary condition given by Newton’s law of cooling, namely that the heat flux at the boundary is $q'' = h\\left(T_{w} - T_{\\infty}\\right)$, where $h$ is the heat transfer coefficient, $T_{w}$ is the wall temperature, and $T_{\\infty}$ is the ambient temperature. Assume that the face $f$ exchanges heat with the environment such that the net heat flow across $f$ entering or leaving the control volume can be written in terms of the control-volume temperature $T_{P}$ and known data.\n\nStarting from energy conservation over the control volume and Newton's law of cooling, recast the convective boundary contribution at face $f$ into the standard linearized source form $S = S_{C} + S_{P} T_{P}$ prescribed in source term linearization strategies. Choose $S_{P}$ to satisfy the diagonal dominance requirement appropriate for linearized sources. Then, determine how this linearized source modifies the assembled algebraic balance $a_{P} T_{P} = \\sum a_{nb} T_{nb} + b_{P}$ at the adjacent cell, and compute the numerical contributions $\\Delta a_{P}$ and $\\Delta b_{P}$ that must be added to the diagonal coefficient $a_{P}$ and the right-hand side $b_{P}$ due solely to the convective boundary at face $f$.\n\nUse the data $h = 100\\,\\text{W/m}^{2}\\text{/K}$, $A_{f} = 0.01\\,\\text{m}^{2}$, and $T_{\\infty} = 300\\,\\text{K}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer and computational fluid dynamics, well-posed, and objective. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe foundation of the Finite Volume Method (FVM) is the conservation of a physical quantity over a control volume. For a steady-state heat transfer problem, this means the net rate of heat energy entering the control volume is zero. The energy balance for the control volume $P$ adjacent to the boundary face $f$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} Q_{i} + S_{\\text{vol}} \\Delta V = 0\n$$\nwhere $Q_{i}$ is the net heat flow rate across face $i$, $S_{\\text{vol}}$ is a volumetric heat source, and $\\Delta V$ is the volume of the control volume. In this problem, we are concerned only with the contribution from the convective boundary at face $f$. The heat flow across this face, $Q_f$, is treated as a source term for the control volume cell.\n\nAccording to Newton's law of cooling, the heat flux (heat flow rate per unit area) from the wall surface at temperature $T_w$ to the ambient environment at temperature $T_{\\infty}$ is given by:\n$$\nq'' = h (T_{w} - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient. By convention in FVM, heat flow *into* the control volume is considered positive. Therefore, the heat flow rate into the control volume through face $f$ is:\n$$\nQ_{f} = -q'' A_{f} = -h A_{f} (T_{w} - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nwhere $A_{f}$ is the area of the boundary face $f$.\n\nTo incorporate this heat flow into the discretized algebraic equation for the cell-centered temperature $T_P$, we must express the wall temperature $T_w$ in terms of the nodal temperatures. For a boundary control volume in a solid, a standard and necessary approximation is to assume the temperature at the wall face is equal to the temperature at the center of the control volume:\n$$\nT_w \\approx T_P\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the expression for $Q_f$, we obtain the heat source contribution from the boundary:\n$$\nS = Q_{f} = -h A_{f} (T_P - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nThis source term $S$ depends on the unknown variable $T_P$. To maintain the linear structure of the final algebraic system, this term must be linearized into the standard form $S = S_C + S_P T_P$. By rearranging the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = h A_{f} T_{\\infty} - h A_{f} T_P\n$$\nComparing this with the linearized form $S = S_C + S_P T_P$, we can identify the components:\n$$\nS_C = h A_{f} T_{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\nS_P = -h A_{f}\n$$\nThe general practice for source term linearization requires that the coefficient $S_P$ must be less than or equal to zero ($S_P \\le 0$). This ensures that when the term $S_P T_P$ is moved to the left-hand side of the algebraic equation, it adds a positive value to the main diagonal coefficient $a_P$, thus reinforcing diagonal dominance and promoting stability of the numerical solution. Since $h$ and $A_f$ are physical quantities that must be positive, our derived $S_P = -h A_f$ is indeed negative, satisfying this crucial condition.\n\nThe general form of the discretized algebraic equation for cell $P$ is:\n$$\na_P T_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + b_P\n$$\nwhere $a_{nb}$ are the coefficients for neighboring cells, and $b_P$ is the constant part of the source term. Before accounting for the boundary source, let the equation be $a_P^0 T_P = \\sum a_{nb} T_{nb} + b_P^0$. The total source term, including the linearized boundary contribution, is added to the right-hand side:\n$$\na_P^0 T_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + b_P^0 + S = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + b_P^0 + S_C + S_P T_P\n$$\nTo restore the standard form, we move the term containing $T_P$ to the left-hand side:\n$$\n(a_P^0 - S_P) T_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + (b_P^0 + S_C)\n$$\nThe new diagonal coefficient is $a_P = a_P^0 - S_P$, and the new constant source part is $b_P = b_P^0 + S_C$.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical contributions, $\\Delta a_P$ and $\\Delta b_P$, that must be added to the coefficients due solely to the convective boundary. These are the changes from the baseline values ($a_P^0$, $b_P^0$) that do not include the boundary effect.\nThe change in the diagonal coefficient is:\n$$\n\\Delta a_P = a_P - a_P^0 = -S_P\n$$\nThe change in the constant source term is:\n$$\n\\Delta b_P = b_P - b_P^0 = S_C\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_C$ and $S_P$:\n$$\n\\Delta a_P = -(-h A_{f}) = h A_{f}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta b_P = h A_{f} T_{\\infty}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $h = 100\\,\\text{W/m}^{2}\\text{/K}$, $A_{f} = 0.01\\,\\text{m}^{2}$, and $T_{\\infty} = 300\\,\\text{K}$.\n\nThe numerical contribution to the diagonal coefficient $a_P$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta a_P = (100\\,\\text{W/m}^{2}\\text{/K}) \\times (0.01\\,\\text{m}^{2}) = 1\\,\\text{W/K}\n$$\nThe numerical contribution to the constant source term $b_P$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta b_P = (100\\,\\text{W/m}^{2}\\text{/K}) \\times (0.01\\,\\text{m}^{2}) \\times (300\\,\\text{K}) = 1 \\times 300\\,\\text{W} = 300\\,\\text{W}\n$$\nThe final answer is the pair of values $(\\Delta a_P, \\Delta b_P)$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the linearization of a latent heat source term for a one-dimensional phase-change problem solved using the Finite Volume Method (FVM) with a fully implicit time integration scheme. The goal is to derive the coefficient $S_P$ from the linearized source term representation $S_P\\,T^{n+1}+S_C$ and evaluate it numerically.\n\nFirst, let us establish the governing energy equation. In a system involving phase change, the conservation of energy can be expressed in terms of enthalpy, $h$. The rate of change of enthalpy per unit volume is balanced by heat conduction and any volumetric sources. The enthalpy is given by $h(T) = c\\,T + L\\,f(T)$, where $c$ is the specific heat, $L$ is the latent heat, and $f(T)$ is the liquid fraction.\nThe governing equation is:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T)\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density and $k$ is the thermal conductivity.

Rearranging the equation to isolate the transient term for temperature:\n$$\n\\rho c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T) - \\rho L \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe problem defines the latent heat source term as $S(T) \\equiv \\rho\\,L\\,\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t}$. Therefore, this term acts as a sink in the temperature equation, entering with a negative sign. The total source term in the temperature equation is $S_{\\text{eff}} = -S(T)$.\n\nFor a fully implicit time discretization, all terms are evaluated at the new time level, $n+1$. The time derivative is approximated using a first-order backward difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{T^{n+1} - T^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nAnd similarly for the liquid fraction derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{f(T^{n+1}) - f(T^n)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe effective source term at time $n+1$ is thus approximated as:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1} = -\\rho L \\frac{f(T^{n+1}) - f(T^n)}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThis expression is non-linear in the unknown temperature $T^{n+1}$ because $f$ is a function of $T^{n+1}$. To incorporate this into a linear system of algebraic equations, we must linearize it. The problem specifies linearization about the previous time level temperature, $T^n$, into the form $S_P T^{n+1} + S_C$.\nThis is achieved by using a first-order Taylor series expansion of $f(T^{n+1})$ around $T^n$:\n$$\nf(T^{n+1}) \\approx f(T^n) + \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n (T^{n+1} - T^n)\n$$\nwhere $\\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n$ is the derivative of the liquid fraction with respect to temperature, evaluated at $T^n$.\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the expression for $S_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1}$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1} \\approx -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left[ \\left( f(T^n) + \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n (T^{n+1} - T^n) \\right) - f(T^n) \\right]\n$$\nThe $f(T^n)$ terms cancel out:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1} \\approx -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n (T^{n+1} - T^n) \\right]\n$$\nRearranging this into the desired linearized form $S_P T^{n+1} + S_C$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{eff}}^{n+1} \\approx \\left[ -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n \\right] T^{n+1} + \\left[ \\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n T^n \\right]\n$$\nBy comparing this with the target form, we identify the coefficients $S_P$ and $S_C$:\n$$\nS_P = -\\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n\n$$\n$$\nS_C = \\frac{\\rho L}{\\Delta t} \\left(\\frac{df}{dT}\\right)^n T^n = -S_P T^n\n$$\nThe problem provides the explicit constraint that $S_P \\le 0$.

To treat the nonlinearity in $S(T)$, you intend to linearize the source in the standard form $$S(T) \\approx S_C + S_P \\, T,$$ where $S_C$ and $S_P$ are coefficients to be determined at each iteration, with $S_C$ assembled into the right-hand side and $S_P$ assembled into the coefficient of the unknown temperature.

Answer the following multiple-choice question; select all options that are correct.\n\nA. For exothermic sources with $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}  0$, setting $S_P = 0$ and taking $S_C = S(T^{*})$, where $T^{*}$ is a lagged or previously computed temperature, is a safe choice that enforces the sign condition on $S_P$ and preserves boundedness in the implicit discretization.\n\nB. Choosing $S_P = \\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T^{*}}  0$ improves convergence and preserves boundedness because it captures temperature sensitivity in the implicit coefficient.\n\nC.

            "solution": "The core of this problem is to understand how the linearization of a source term $S(T)$ impacts the numerical stability of the discretized equation in the Finite Volume Method (FVM). The key lies in analyzing the main diagonal coefficient of the resulting linear system.\n\nLet's start with the general FVM discretization for a control volume $P$ using a fully implicit scheme:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho c V_P}{\\Delta t} (T_P - T_P^0) = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} (T_{nb} - T_P) + S(T_P) V_P $$\nwhere $T_P$ is the unknown temperature, $T_P^0$ is the temperature from the previous time step, $V_P$ is the control volume, and $a_{nb}$ are the positive coefficients representing heat transfer to neighboring cells.\n\nLinearizing the source term as $S(T_P) \\approx S_C + S_P T_P$ and rearranging the equation to group terms with the unknown $T_P$ on the left-hand side gives:\n$$ \\left( \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} + \\frac{\\rho c V_P}{\\Delta t} - S_P V_P \\right) T_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} T_{nb} + \\frac{\\rho c V_P}{\\Delta t} T_P^0 + S_C V_P $$\nThe main diagonal coefficient of the linear system for cell $P$ is $a_P = \\sum_{nb} a_{nb} + \\frac{\\rho c V_P}{\\Delta t} - S_P V_P$.\nFor the numerical solution to be bounded and stable (guaranteeing diagonal dominance), the contribution from the source term, $-S_P V_P$, must not weaken the diagonal. Since $V_P > 0$, the most robust way to ensure this is to require that this term is non-negative:\n$$ -S_P V_P \\ge 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad S_P \\le 0 $$\nThis is the fundamental \"golden rule\" for source term linearization. Any strategy that violates this rule risks numerical instability, especially for exothermic sources where the physical feedback ($\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T} > 0$) is positive. With this rule in mind, let's analyze the options.\n\n**A. Correct.** Setting $S_P = 0$ perfectly satisfies the stability condition $S_P \\le 0$. The source term is treated fully explicitly by setting $S_C = S(T^*)$. This is the simplest and a guaranteed-stable approach, although it might lead to slow convergence for stiff sources. It preserves the boundedness of the discretization.\n\n**B. Incorrect.** For an exothermic source, $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T} > 0$. Choosing $S_P = \\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T^{*}}$ means choosing $S_P > 0$. This directly violates the stability condition. It subtracts from the main diagonal coefficient $a_P$, weakening diagonal dominance and creating a positive feedback loop in the numerical scheme that can lead to divergence.\n\n**C. Correct.** This describes a general and robust method. By choosing $S_P = -\\beta$ with $\\beta \\ge 0$, the condition $S_P \\le 0$ is explicitly enforced. The construction $S_C = S(T^*) - S_P T^*$ ensures that the linearized source $S_C + S_P T$ matches the true source at the reference temperature $T^*$, which is a desirable property for accuracy. This strategy correctly enforces stability while maintaining consistency.\n\n**D. Correct.** This is a practical and sophisticated application of the principle from option C, tailored for a stiff Arrhenius source. The physical derivative $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}$ is positive. By setting $S_P = -\\theta \\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T^{*}}$ with $0 \\le \\theta \\le 1$, we guarantee $S_P \\le 0$. This adds a stabilizing term to the main diagonal that is proportional to the physical stiffness of the source, which can significantly improve convergence. The damping factor $\\theta$ allows for tuning the implicitness. This method correctly increases the diagonal coefficient and preserves boundedness.\n\n**E. Incorrect.** The stability condition is $S_P \\le 0$, which includes the case $S_P = 0$. Therefore, the claim that $S_P$ must be *strictly* negative is false. Furthermore, the choice $S_P = 0$ (explicit treatment) does not lead to energy non-conservation. The FVM itself ensures conservation; the linearization strategy affects the stability and convergence path of the iterative solver, not the conservation property of the discretization.\n\nTherefore, options A, C, and D represent valid and correct strategies for source term linearization.",
