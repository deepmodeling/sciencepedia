            "problem": "A junction in a tree-like flow network consists of a single parent channel (mother) of length $L_{m}$ and diameter $d_{m}$ that splits into two daughter channels of lengths $L_{d}$, $L_{s}$ and diameters $d_{d}$, $d_{s}$, respectively. The volumetric flow rate entering the mother channel is $Q_{m}$ and it divides into $Q_{d}$ and $Q_{s}$ in the daughters, with $Q_{m} = Q_{d} + Q_{s}$.

These are standard tools in thermal-fluid engineering and biophysics. The problem represents a classic application of constructal theory.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is a well-posed constrained optimization problem. The phrase \"total solid volume occupied by the three channels\" is ambiguous. It could refer to the volume of the material making up the pipe walls or the fluid-filled volume within the channels. In the context of constructal theory, the \"volume occupied by the flow\" is a standard constraint and refers to the fluid volume. Interpreting it as the volume of the solid material would render the problem ill-posed, as wall thickness is not provided. Thus, the problem is valid under the standard and most plausible interpretation that the total *fluid* volume is fixed: $V_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}(L_m d_m^2 + L_d d_d^2 + L_s d_s^2)$.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, mathematical terms.\n-   The problem is free from the other invalidity flags: it is not scientifically unsound, irrelevant, incomplete (under the stated interpretation), contradictory, unrealistic, ill-structured, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**.

This will be done for both a Newtonian fluid and a non-Newtonian power-law fluid.\n\n**Part 1: Newtonian Fluid**\n\nFor steady, fully developed, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a circular pipe of length $L$ and diameter $d$, the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{128 \\mu L Q}{\\pi d^4} $$\nwhere $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nThe pumping power $\\dot{W}$ required to sustain this flow is the product of the flow rate and the pressure drop:\n$$ \\dot{W} = Q \\Delta P = Q \\left( \\frac{128 \\mu L Q}{\\pi d^4} \\right) = \\frac{128 \\mu L}{\\pi} \\frac{Q^2}{d^4} $$\nThe total pumping power for the three-channel junction is the sum of the power for each channel:\n$$ \\dot{W}_{\\text{tot}} = \\dot{W}_m + \\dot{W}_d + \\dot{W}_s = \\frac{128 \\mu}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{L_m Q_m^2}{d_m^4} + \\frac{L_d Q_d^2}{d_d^4} + \\frac{L_s Q_s^2}{d_s^4} \\right) $$\nThe objective is to minimize $\\dot{W}_{\\text{tot}}$. The constraint is the fixed total fluid volume $V_{\\text{tot}}$:\n$$ V_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (L_m d_m^2 + L_d d_d^2 + L_s d_s^2) = \\text{constant} $$\nThe optimization variables are the diameters $d_m, d_d, d_s$. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(d_m, d_d, d_s, \\lambda) = \\frac{128 \\mu}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{L_m Q_m^2}{d_m^4} + \\frac{L_d Q_d^2}{d_d^4} + \\frac{L_s Q_s^2}{d_s^4} \\right) + \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} (L_m d_m^2 + L_d d_d^2 + L_s d_s^2) - V_{\\text{tot}} \\right) $$\nTo find the minimum, we set the partial derivatives with respect to each diameter to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial d_m} = \\frac{128 \\mu}{\\pi} \\left( -4 \\frac{L_m Q_m^2}{d_m^5} \\right) + \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\cdot 2 L_m d_m \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial d_d} = \\frac{128 \\mu}{\\pi} \\left( -4 \\frac{L_d Q_d^2}{d_d^5} \\right) + \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\cdot 2 L_d d_d \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial d_s} = \\frac{128 \\mu}{\\pi} \\left( -4 \\frac{L_s Q_s^2}{d_s^5} \\right) + \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\cdot 2 L_s d_s \\right) = 0 $$\nFrom the first equation, we solve for the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda \\frac{\\pi}{2} L_m d_m = \\frac{128 \\mu}{\\pi} \\frac{4 L_m Q_m^2}{d_m^5} \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{1024 \\mu}{\\pi^2} \\frac{Q_m^2}{d_m^6} $$\nDoing the same for the other two equations yields analogous expressions for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1024 \\mu}{\\pi^2} \\frac{Q_d^2}{d_d^6} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda = \\frac{1024 \\mu}{\\pi^2} \\frac{Q_s^2}{d_s^6} $$\nSince $\\lambda$ must be the same for all three equations, we obtain the optimality condition:\n$$ \\frac{Q_m^2}{d_m^6} = \\frac{Q_d^2}{d_d^6} = \\frac{Q_s^2}{d_s^6} $$\nTaking the square root (and considering only positive physical quantities for $Q$ and $d$) gives:\n$$ \\frac{Q_m}{d_m^3} = \\frac{Q_d}{d_d^3} = \\frac{Q_s}{d_s^3} = C $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. This implies $Q_i = C d_i^3$ for $i \\in \\{m, d, s\\}$. Using the flow conservation law $Q_m = Q_d + Q_s$:\n$$ C d_m^3 = C d_d^3 + C d_s^3 $$\n$$ d_m^3 = d_d^3 + d_s^3 $$\nThis is the well-known Murray's Law for bifurcations.\n\n**Part 2: Non-Newtonian Power-law Fluid**\n\nFor a power-law fluid with $\\tau = k \\dot{\\gamma}^n$, the relation between flow rate $Q$ and pressure drop $\\Delta P$ in a circular pipe of diameter $d$ and length $L$ is:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi n}{3n+1} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta P}{2kL} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} \\left( \\frac{d}{2} \\right)^{\\frac{3n+1}{n}} $$\nSolving for $\\Delta P$:\n$$ \\Delta P = 2kL \\left( Q \\frac{3n+1}{\\pi n} \\left( \\frac{2}{d} \\right)^{\\frac{3n+1}{n}} \\right)^n = 2kL \\left(\\frac{3n+1}{\\pi n}\\right)^n 2^{3n+1} \\frac{Q^n}{d^{3n+1}} $$\nThe pumping power $\\dot{W} = Q \\Delta P$ is:\n$$ \\dot{W} = 2kL \\left(\\frac{3n+1}{\\pi n}\\right)^n 2^{3n+1} \\frac{Q^{n+1}}{d^{3n+1}} $$\nThe pumping power scales as $\\dot{W} \\propto L Q^{n+1} / d^{3n+1}$. The total pumping power is:\n$$ \\dot{W}_{\\text{tot}} = C_{PL} \\left( \\frac{L_m Q_m^{n+1}}{d_m^{3n+1}} + \\frac{L_d Q_d^{n+1}}{d_d^{3n+1}} + \\frac{L_s Q_s^{n+1}}{d_s^{3n+1}} \\right) $$\nwhere $C_{PL} = 2k (2^{3n+1}) \\left(\\frac{3n+1}{\\pi n}\\right)^n$ is a constant for a given fluid.\n\nWe minimize this objective function subject to the same volume constraint, $V_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\sum L_i d_i^2 = \\text{constant}$. The Lagrangian is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = C_{PL} \\sum_{i} \\frac{L_i Q_i^{n+1}}{d_i^{3n+1}} + \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\sum_{i} L_i d_i^2 - V_{\\text{tot}} \\right) $$\nSetting the partial derivative with respect to a generic diameter $d_j$ to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial d_j} = C_{PL} \\left( \\frac{L_j Q_j^{n+1} (-(3n+1))}{d_j^{3n+2}} \\right) + \\lambda \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\cdot 2 L_j d_j \\right) = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda \\frac{\\pi}{2} L_j d_j = C_{PL} \\frac{L_j Q_j^{n+1} (3n+1)}{d_j^{3n+2}} \\implies \\lambda = \\frac{2 C_{PL} (3n+1)}{\\pi} \\frac{Q_j^{n+1}}{d_j^{3n+3}} $$\nThis must hold for all channels ($j=m, d, s$), so we have the optimality condition:\n$$ \\frac{Q_m^{n+1}}{d_m^{3n+3}} = \\frac{Q_d^{n+1}}{d_d^{3n+3}} = \\frac{Q_s^{n+1}}{d_s^{3n+3}} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{Q_m^{n+1}}{d_m^{3(n+1)}} = \\frac{Q_d^{n+1}}{d_d^{3(n+1)}} = \\frac{Q_s^{n+1}}{d_s^{3(n+1)}} $$\nTaking the $(n+1)$-th root of all terms gives:\n$$ \\frac{Q_m}{d_m^3} = \\frac{Q_d}{d_d^3} = \\frac{Q_s}{d_s^3} $$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained for the Newtonian fluid. The exponent in the optimal diameter law relating flow rate to diameter ($Q \\propto d^3$) is independent of the power-law index $n$. Using the flow conservation law $Q_m = Q_d + Q_s$, we once again arrive at:\n$$ d_m^3 = d_d^3 + d_s^3 $$\nThus, the relationship between the optimal mother and daughter diameters is the same for both Newtonian and power-law fluids under the given constraints.\n\nThe explicit law relating the optimal mother diameter $d_{m}$ to the daughter diameters $d_{d}$ and $d_{s}$ is obtained by solving for $d_m$:\n$$ d_m = (d_d^3 + d_s^3)^{\\frac{1}{3}} $$",

            "problem": "A tree-like cooling network is designed for an electronic module following the principles of constructal theory for flow and thermal architecture. The network is a symmetric binary tree with $L=7$ levels from the root to the terminal branches. The diameters of all branches have been computed from Murray’s law, such that the cube of the parent diameter equals the sum of the cubes of the two daughter diameters at each bifurcation.

The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to derive a unique solution, and is stated using objective, unambiguous language. There are no contradictions or missing data. The problem is a non-trivial application of scaling laws to a branching flow network.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by first establishing the scaling laws for mass flow rate and diameter across the network levels. Then, the Reynolds number for a generic branch is expressed as a function of its level index, allowing for the identification of the branch with the highest Reynolds number. This determines the governing constraint for maintaining laminar flow throughout the network.\n\nLet the levels of the tree network be indexed by $k$, where $k=0$ corresponds to the single root (inlet) branch and $k=L$ corresponds to the terminal branches. Given $L=7$, the levels are $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots, 7$.\n\nFor a symmetric binary tree, the number of branches at level $k$ is $N_k = 2^k$.\nThe total inlet mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}$, enters at the root branch ($k=0$), so $\\dot{m}_0 = \\dot{m}$. Due to the condition of equal mass flow splitting at each bifurcation, the mass flow rate in a single branch at level $k$ is given by:\n$$ \\dot{m}_k = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{N_k} = \\frac{\\dot{m}}{2^k} $$\n\nMurray’s law states that for a symmetric bifurcation, the diameter of the parent branch ($D_{k-1}$) is related to the diameter of the two identical daughter branches ($D_k$) by $D_{k-1}^3 = D_k^3 + D_k^3 = 2D_k^3$. This yields the scaling relation:\n$$ D_{k-1} = 2^{1/3} D_k $$\nThis implies that diameters decrease at deeper levels of the tree. We can express the diameter $D_k$ at any level $k$ in terms of the given terminal diameter $D_L$. Starting from the terminal level $L$ and moving up:\n$D_{L-1} = 2^{1/3} D_L$\n$D_{L-2} = 2^{1/3} D_{L-1} = 2^{1/3}(2^{1/3} D_L) = 2^{2/3} D_L$\nGeneralizing this pattern for a level $k$:\n$$ D_k = D_{L - (L-k)} = 2^{(L-k)/3} D_L $$\nThis relation correctly yields $D_L$ for $k=L$ and $D_0 = 2^{L/3} D_L$ for $k=0$.\n\nThe Reynolds number ($Re$) for flow in a circular conduit is defined as $Re = \\frac{\\rho u D}{\\mu}$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $u$ is the average velocity, $D$ is the diameter, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. The mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ is related to velocity by $\\dot{m} = \\rho A u = \\rho \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4} u$. This allows writing the Reynolds number in terms of mass flow rate, which is advantageous as it does not require the fluid density:\n$$ Re = \\frac{\\rho \\left(\\frac{4\\dot{m}}{\\pi \\rho D^2}\\right) D}{\\mu} = \\frac{4\\dot{m}}{\\pi \\mu D} $$\nWe now express the Reynolds number for a branch at level $k$, $Re_k$, by substituting the scaling laws for $\\dot{m}_k$ and $D_k$:\n$$ Re_k = \\frac{4 \\dot{m}_k}{\\pi \\mu D_k} = \\frac{4 (\\dot{m}/2^k)}{\\pi \\mu (D_L \\cdot 2^{(L-k)/3})} $$\nCombining the powers of $2$ in the denominator:\n$$ Re_k = \\frac{4\\dot{m}}{\\pi \\mu D_L} \\left( \\frac{1}{2^k \\cdot 2^{(L-k)/3}} \\right) = \\frac{4\\dot{m}}{\\pi \\mu D_L} \\left( \\frac{1}{2^{k + (L-k)/3}} \\right) = \\frac{4\\dot{m}}{\\pi \\mu D_L} \\cdot 2^{-(L+2k)/3} $$\n\nTo ensure laminar flow ($Re  Re_c$) everywhere in the network, the condition $Re_k  Re_c$ must hold for all levels $k=0, 1, \\dots, L$. This is equivalent to ensuring that the maximum Reynolds number in the network is below the critical value: $\\max_k(Re_k)  Re_c$.\nTo find the maximum $Re_k$, we analyze its dependence on the level index $k$. The term $\\frac{4\\dot{m}}{\\pi \\mu D_L}$ is constant for a given inlet flow. $Re_k$ is maximized when the exponent $-(L+2k)/3$ is maximized. This occurs when the term $(L+2k)/3$ is minimized. Since $L$ is a positive constant and $k \\geq 0$, the expression $(L+2k)/3$ is minimized at the smallest possible value of $k$, which is $k=0$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum Reynolds number occurs in the root branch ($k=0$). This branch governs the constraint on the total mass flow rate.\n\nThe condition to maintain laminar flow throughout the entire network is thus determined by the root branch:\n$$ Re_0  Re_c $$\nSubstituting $k=0$ into the expression for $Re_k$:\n$$ Re_0 = \\frac{4\\dot{m}}{\\pi \\mu D_L} \\cdot 2^{-L/3}  Re_c $$\nThis inequality is the condition on the total inlet mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$. By rearranging, we get:\n$$ \\dot{m}  \\frac{\\pi \\mu D_L Re_c}{4} \\cdot 2^{L/3} $$\nThe maximum allowable total mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}_{\\max}$, is the value of $\\dot{m}$ for which $Re_0 = Re_c$:\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi \\mu D_L Re_c}{4} \\cdot 2^{L/3} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\dot{m}_{\\max}$ using the given parameters:\n$L = 7$\n$\\mu = 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$\n$D_L = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$Re_c = 2300$\n\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi (6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (2300)}{4} \\cdot 2^{7/3} $$\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\max} = (\\pi \\cdot 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot 10^{-4} \\cdot 2300) \\cdot 2^{7/3} \\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\max} = (6900\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\cdot 2^{7/3} \\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\max} \\approx (2.1677 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot 2^{7/3} \\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nThe term $2^{7/3} = (2^7)^{1/3} = 128^{1/3} \\approx 5.039684$.\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\max} \\approx (2.1677 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot 5.039684 \\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\max} \\approx 0.0109249 \\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\max} = 1.092 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\nFinally, we assess the feasibility of operating at the desired inlet mass flow rate, $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{des}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nWe compare $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{des}}$ with the calculated maximum allowable rate $\\dot{m}_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{des}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\dot{m}_{\\max} = 1.092 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nSince $\\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{des}} > \\dot{m}_{\\max}$, operating at the desired flow rate is not feasible if laminar flow must be maintained throughout the network.

The number of channels at level $k$ is $b^k$.\n- Each channel at level $k$ is assumed circular with radius $r_k$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), and length $L_k$ that scales with the geometric coverage as $L_k = L_0 \\, b^{-k/2}$, where $L_0$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$) is a reference length scale of the domain.\n- The volumetric flow rate through each level-$k$ channel is $Q_k = Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}/b^k$.\n- Flow is laminar in all channels. For a circular channel of radius $r$ and length $L$, the pressure drop is related to the flow rate by the Hagen–Poiseuille law, $\\Delta p = \\dfrac{8 \\mu L Q}{\\pi r^4}$.\n\nDefine the total pumping power as the sum of viscous dissipation over all channels in the network,\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{L} b^k \\, \\Delta p_k \\, Q_k,\n$$\nand impose a fixed total channel volume constraint\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{L} b^k \\, \\pi r_k^2 \\, L_k = V_{\\mathrm{tot}},\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ (in $\\mathrm{m^3}$) is prescribed.\n\nManufacturing imposes a finite minimum channel width $w_{\\min}$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$), which translates to a minimum radius constraint $r_k \\ge r_{\\min}$ with $r_{\\min} = w_{\\min}/2$. The design variables are the integer branching factor $b$, the integer number of levels $L$, and the continuous radii $\\{r_k\\}_{k=0}^L$.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and the Hagen–Poiseuille law, formulate the optimization problem of minimizing $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ subject to the fixed volume constraint and the lower bound $r_k \\ge r_{\\min}$. Derive the stationarity condition for the optimal radii in the absence of the lower bound and explain how the lower bound modifies the solution via inequality constraints. Then, design an algorithm that, for given $(\\mu,Q_{\\mathrm{tot}},L_0,V_{\\mathrm{tot}},w_{\\min})$, scans a finite set of integer candidates for $(b,L)$ subject to a minimum required number of terminals $N_{\\min}$, where the number of terminal branches is $N=b^L$. For each candidate, determine whether a feasible radius allocation satisfying $r_k \\ge r_{\\min}$ and the fixed total volume exists. If feasible, compute the optimal radii using a one-dimensional search over the Lagrange multiplier associated with the volume constraint, and evaluate $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Search over the integer branching factor $b \\in \\{2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and the number of levels $L \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, with the constraint $b^L \\ge N_{\\min}$.\n- For each feasible pair $(b,L)$, compute the sequence $\\{r_k\\}$ that minimizes $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ subject to the volume constraint and $r_k \\ge r_{\\min}$, and then compute $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ (in $\\mathrm{W}$).\n- Select the pair $(b,L)$ that minimizes $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and report $(b_{\\mathrm{opt}},N_{\\mathrm{opt}},L_{\\mathrm{opt}},P_{\\mathrm{opt}})$, where $N_{\\mathrm{opt}} = b_{\\mathrm{opt}}^{L_{\\mathrm{opt}}}$.\n\nExpress $P_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ in watts ($\\mathrm{W}$) and round it to six decimal places. All other outputs are integers.\n\nTest suite:\nUse the following three parameter sets to evaluate your program. In each case, search over $b \\in \\{2,3,4,5,6\\}$ and $L \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, and enforce $b^L \\ge N_{\\min}$.\n\n- Case A (happy path, moderate $w_{\\min}$): $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$, $Q_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m^3/s}$, $L_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $V_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^3}$, $w_{\\min} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $N_{\\min} = 16$.\n- Case B (large $w_{\\min}$ causing strong lower-bound activity): $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$, $Q_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m^3/s}$, $L_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $V_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^3}$, $w_{\\min} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $N_{\\min} = 16$.\n- Case C (small $w_{\\min}$ and higher coverage requirement): $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$, $Q_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m^3/s}$, $L_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $V_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m^3}$, $w_{\\min} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $N_{\\min} = 64$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case contributes a list in the form $[b_{\\mathrm{opt}},N_{\\mathrm{opt}},L_{\\mathrm{opt}},P_{\\mathrm{opt}}]$. For example, the output should look like:\n$[[b_1,N_1,L_1,P_1],[b_2,N_2,L_2,P_2],[b_3,N_3,L_3,P_3]]$.",
            "solution": "The user-provided problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics (Hagen–Poiseuille flow), mathematically well-posed as a constrained optimization problem, and objectively formulated without ambiguity.\n\n### Step 1: Formulation of the Optimization Problem\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total pumping power, $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, required to drive a coolant through a hierarchical tree of channels. The total power is the sum of viscous dissipation in all channels.\n\nThe power dissipated in a single channel at level $k$ is $\\Delta p_k Q_k$. With $b^k$ channels at level $k$, the total power is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{L} b^k \\Delta p_k Q_k\n$$\nThe flow is described by the Hagen–Poiseuille law for a circular channel of radius $r_k$ and length $L_k$:\n$$\n\\Delta p_k = \\frac{8 \\mu L_k Q_k}{\\pi r_k^4}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a self-similar architecture where flow is conserved at each branch point, so the flow rate in a level-$k$ channel is $Q_k = Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}/b^k$. The channel length scales as $L_k = L_0 b^{-k/2}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the total power equation yields:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{L} b^k \\left( \\frac{8 \\mu (L_0 b^{-k/2})}{\\pi r_k^4} \\left(\\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{b^k}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{b^k} \\right) = \\frac{8 \\mu Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 L_0}{\\pi} \\sum_{k=0}^{L} \\frac{b^{-3k/2}}{r_k^4}\n$$\nThis can be written as $P_{\\mathrm{tot}} = C_P \\sum_{k=0}^{L} \\frac{b^{-3k/2}}{r_k^4}$, where $C_P = \\frac{8 \\mu Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 L_0}{\\pi}$ is a constant.\n\nThe optimization is subject to two constraints:\n$1$. A fixed total volume of all channels, $V_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{L} b^k (\\pi r_k^2 L_k) = \\pi L_0 \\sum_{k=0}^{L} b^{k/2} r_k^2\n$$\n$2$. A minimum manufacturable channel radius, $r_k \\ge r_{\\min}$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, L\\}$.\n\nFor a fixed integer branching factor $b$ and number of levels $L$, the problem is to find the set of radii $\\{r_k\\}_{k=0}^L$ that minimizes $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ subject to these constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of Optimal Radii using Lagrange Multipliers\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem that can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers, extended by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to handle the inequality constraints. The Lagrangian $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\{r_k\\}, \\lambda, \\{\\nu_k\\}) = P_{\\mathrm{tot}} + \\lambda \\left( \\pi L_0 \\sum_{k=0}^{L} b^{k/2} r_k^2 - V_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\right) - \\sum_{k=0}^{L} \\nu_k (r_k - r_{\\min})\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the Lagrange multiplier for the equality (volume) constraint, and $\\{\\nu_k\\}$ are the multipliers for the inequality (minimum radius) constraints. The KKT conditions require $\\nu_k \\ge 0$ and the complementary slackness condition $\\nu_k (r_k - r_{\\min}) = 0$.\n\nThe stationarity condition is $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial r_j} = 0$ for each $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, L\\}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_j} \\left( C_P \\frac{b^{-3j/2}}{r_j^4} + \\lambda \\pi L_0 b^{j/2} r_j^2 - \\nu_j r_j \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-4 C_P \\frac{b^{-3j/2}}{r_j^5} + 2 \\lambda \\pi L_0 b^{j/2} r_j - \\nu_j = 0\n$$\n\nThe complementary slackness condition implies two cases for each level $j$:\n- **Case 1: Radius constraint is inactive ($r_j > r_{\\min}$).**\nThis implies $\\nu_j=0$. The stationarity condition becomes:\n$$\n2 \\lambda \\pi L_0 b^{j/2} r_j = 4 C_P \\frac{b^{-3j/2}}{r_j^5} \\implies r_j^6 = \\frac{2 C_P}{\\lambda \\pi L_0} b^{-2j}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_P = \\frac{8 \\mu Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 L_0}{\\pi}$:\n$$\nr_j^6 = \\frac{2}{\\lambda \\pi L_0} \\left( \\frac{8 \\mu Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2 L_0}{\\pi} \\right) b^{-2j} = \\frac{16 \\mu Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{\\lambda \\pi^2} b^{-2j}\n$$\nThe unconstrained radius $r_{j, \\text{unc}}$ is:\n$$\nr_{j, \\text{unc}} = \\left( \\frac{16 \\mu Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{\\pi^2} \\right)^{1/6} \\lambda^{-1/6} b^{-j/3}\n$$\n\n- **Case 2: Radius constraint is active ($r_j = r_{\\min}$).**\nIn this case, the radius is fixed at its lower bound. The multiplier $\\nu_j$ must be non-negative, which imposes a condition on $\\lambda$.\n\nCombining both cases, the optimal radius at level $j$ is the maximum of the unconstrained value and the minimum allowed value:\n$$\nr_j = \\max(r_{\\min}, r_{j, \\text{unc}})\n$$\nLet's define a constant $A = \\left(\\frac{16 \\mu Q_{\\mathrm{tot}}^2}{\\pi^2}\\right)^{1/3}$ and a new variable $x = \\lambda^{-1/3}$. Since $\\lambda > 0$, we have $x > 0$. The squared radius can be expressed as:\n$$\nr_j^2 = \\max(r_{\\min}^2, A x b^{-2j/3})\n$$\nThe term $b^{-2j/3}$ decreases with $j$, so the unconstrained radius also decreases with level number. This means that if the constraint is active at level $j$, it will also be active for all subsequent levels $k > j$.\n\n### Step 3: Algorithmic Design\n\nFor a given pair of $(b, L)$, the set of optimal radii $\\{r_k\\}$ is parameterized by a single unknown, $x$ (or equivalently, $\\lambda$). The value of $x$ is determined by substituting the expression for $r_k^2$ back into the volume constraint:\n$$f(x) = \\pi L_0 \\sum_{k=0}^{L} b^{k/2} \\max(r_{\\min}^2, A x b^{-2k/3}) - V_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0$$\nThe function $f(x)$ is monotonically increasing with $x$. This structure allows us to find the unique positive root $x_{\\mathrm{sol}}$ using a one-dimensional numerical root-finding algorithm, such as the bisection method or Brent's method.\n\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n$1$. Initialize the minimum power found so far, $P_{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\infty$, and an empty container for the optimal parameters, $(b_{\\mathrm{opt}}, N_{\\mathrm{opt}}, L_{\\mathrm{opt}})$.\n$2$. For each integer branching factor $b$ in the candidate set $\\{2,3,4,5,6\\}$:\n$3$. For each integer number of levels $L$ in the candidate set $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$:\n    a. Check if the number of terminal channels $N = b^L$ meets the minimum requirement: $b^L \\ge N_{\\min}$. If not, continue to the next iteration.\n    b. **Feasibility Check**: Determine if it's possible to satisfy the volume constraint given the minimum radius constraint. The minimum possible volume for the given $(b, L)$ is $V_{\\min\\text{-possible}} = \\pi L_0 r_{\\min}^2 \\sum_{k=0}^{L} b^{k/2}$. If $V_{\\mathrm{tot}}  V_{\\min\\text{-possible}}$, no feasible solution exists for this $(b, L)$ pair; continue to the next iteration.\n    c. **Root Finding**: Define the function $f(x)$ as above. The lower end of the search interval for $x$ is $0$. The upper end, $x_{\\mathrm{upper}}$, can be chosen large enough to guarantee $f(x_{\\mathrm{upper}}) > 0$. Use a numerical solver (e.g., `scipy.optimize.brentq`) to find the root $x_{\\mathrm{sol}}$ of $f(x)=0$.\n    d. **Calculate Optimal Radii and Power**: With the solved $x_{\\mathrm{sol}}$, calculate the squared radius for each level: $r_k^2 = \\max(r_{\\min}^2, A x_{\\mathrm{sol}} b^{-2k/3})$. Then, compute the total power dissipation using these radii: $P_{\\mathrm{tot}} = C_P \\sum_{k=0}^{L} \\frac{b^{-3k/2}}{r_k^4}$.\n    e. **Update Optimum**: If the calculated $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}  P_{\\mathrm{opt}}$, update $P_{\\mathrm{opt}} = P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and store the current parameters as the new optimum: $(b_{\\mathrm{opt}}, N_{\\mathrm{opt}}, L_{\\mathrm{opt}}) = (b, b^L, L)$.\n$4$. After iterating through all candidate pairs $(b, L)$, the stored $(b_{\\mathrm{opt}}, N_{\\mathrm{opt}}, L_{\\mathrm{opt}}, P_{\\mathrm{opt}})$ represents the global optimum over the search space.\n$5$.
