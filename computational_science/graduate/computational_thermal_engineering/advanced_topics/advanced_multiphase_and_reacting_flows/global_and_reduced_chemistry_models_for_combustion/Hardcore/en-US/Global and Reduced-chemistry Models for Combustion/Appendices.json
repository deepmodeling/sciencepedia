            "problem": "Consider a reduced single-step global combustion model for a hydrocarbon fuel $F$ reacting with an oxidizer $O$ in a constant-volume, premixed reactor. The global fuel-consumption rate per unit volume is modeled as\n$$\\dot{\\omega}_{F} = -\\rho\\,A\\,Y_{F}^{\\nu}\\,Y_{O}^{\\mu}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right),$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the mass density, $A$ is a temperature-independent pre-exponential factor, $Y_{F}$ and $Y_{O}$ are the reactant mass fractions, $\\nu$ and $\\mu$ are global reaction orders, $E_{a}$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The magnitude $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$ is used because $\\dot{\\omega}_{F}<0$ for fuel consumption.\n\nTwo experiments are performed at the same initial composition and density, ensuring that $\\rho$, $Y_{F}$, $Y_{O}$, and $A$ are identical between experiments so that any temperature sensitivity of $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$ arises solely from the Arrhenius exponential factor. The measured magnitudes of the initial fuel-consumption rates are:\n- At $T_{1} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})| = 4.00 \\times 10^{1}$ in consistent units.\n- At $T_{2} = 1500\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})| = 1.60 \\times 10^{2}$ in the same units.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions and the well-tested Arrhenius form of temperature dependence, derive the temperature sensitivity of the global rate in terms of the derivative $\\partial \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|/\\partial(1/T)$ and interpret the slope in an Arrhenius plot of $\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$ versus $1/T$. Then, using the data above, compute the value of $E_{a}/R$.\n\nExpress your final answer for $E_{a}/R$ in $\\mathrm{K}$ and round your result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as being scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard scenario in chemical kinetics for determining activation energy from experimental data using the Arrhenius equation, a fundamental principle in the field. All necessary data and conditions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts as requested: first, a derivation and interpretation of the temperature sensitivity, and second, the computation of the activation energy term $E_{a}/R$.\n\nThe global fuel-consumption rate per unit volume is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{\\omega}_{F} = -\\rho\\,A\\,Y_{F}^{\\nu}\\,Y_{O}^{\\mu}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem concerns the magnitude of this rate, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$. Since the physical quantities $\\rho$, $A$, $Y_{F}$, and $Y_{O}$ are positive, we have:\n$$\n|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\rho\\,A\\,Y_{F}^{\\nu}\\,Y_{O}^{\\mu}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nThe experimental conditions specify that the initial composition and density are identical for both measurements. This means the terms $\\rho$, $Y_{F}$, and $Y_{O}$ are constant. The pre-exponential factor $A$ is also stated to be temperature-independent. We can therefore group all these constant terms into a single constant, $C$:\n$$\nC = \\rho\\,A\\,Y_{F}^{\\nu}\\,Y_{O}^{\\mu}\n$$\nThe rate expression simplifies to:\n$$\n|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = C\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nTo analyze the temperature sensitivity as requested, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of this equation:\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\ln\\left(C\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\ln(C) + \\ln\\left(\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a linear relationship, which becomes apparent if we consider the variable to be the reciprocal of temperature, $1/T$. Let $x = 1/T$. The equation is then:\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}| = \\ln(C) - \\left(\\frac{E_{a}}{R}\\right)x\n$$\nThis is an equation of a straight line $y = b + mx$, where $y = \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$, the variable is $x = 1/T$, the y-intercept is $b = \\ln(C)$, and the slope is $m = -E_{a}/R$.\n\nThe problem asks for the temperature sensitivity in terms of the derivative $\\partial \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|/\\partial(1/T)$. This is precisely the slope of the line described above. Taking the derivative of $\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$ with respect to $1/T$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|}{\\partial(1/T)} = \\frac{d}{d(1/T)}\\left(\\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\ln(C)$ is a constant, its derivative is zero. The derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|}{\\partial(1/T)} = -\\frac{E_{a}}{R}\n$$\nThe interpretation of this result is that in an \"Arrhenius plot,\" where the natural logarithm of the reaction rate (or a quantity proportional to it, like $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}|$) is plotted on the y-axis against the reciprocal of absolute temperature ($1/T$) on the x-axis, the data should fall on a straight line. The slope of this line is equal to the negative of the activation energy divided by the universal gas constant, $-E_{a}/R$. This provides a direct graphical method for determining the activation energy of a reaction.\n\nNow, we use the provided experimental data to compute the value of $E_{a}/R$. We have two data points:\n1. $T_{1} = 1200\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})| = 4.00 \\times 10^{1}$\n2. $T_{2} = 1500\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})| = 1.60 \\times 10^{2}$\n\nWe can write the ln-linearized rate equation for each point:\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})| = \\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{1}} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})| = \\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{2}} \\quad (2)\n$$\nTo eliminate the unknown constant $C$, we subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n$$\n\\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})| - \\ln |\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})| = \\left(\\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{2}}\\right) - \\left(\\ln(C) - \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})|}{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})|}\\right) = -\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{2}} + \\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T_{1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})|}{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})|}\\right) = \\frac{E_{a}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_{1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the two-point form of the Arrhenius equation. We can now solve for $E_{a}/R$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{R} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})|}{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})|}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{T_{1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{2}}}\n$$\nSubstitute the given numerical values into this expression. First, calculate the ratio of the rates:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{2})|}{|\\dot{\\omega}_{F}(T_{1})|} = \\frac{1.60 \\times 10^{2}}{4.00 \\times 10^{1}} = \\frac{160}{40} = 4.00\n$$\nNext, calculate the difference of the reciprocal temperatures:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_{1}} - \\frac{1}{T_{2}} = \\frac{1}{1200} - \\frac{1}{1500} = \\frac{5}{6000} - \\frac{4}{6000} = \\frac{1}{6000}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nNow substitute these intermediate results back into the equation for $E_{a}/R$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{R} = \\frac{\\ln(4.00)}{\\frac{1}{6000}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}} = 6000 \\cdot \\ln(4.00)\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe value of $\\ln(4.00)$ is approximately $1.38629436$.\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{R} \\approx 6000 \\times 1.38629436\\ \\mathrm{K} \\approx 8317.766\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{E_{a}}{R} \\approx 8318\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe unit of $E_{a}/R$ is Kelvin (K), which is consistent, as the term $E_{a}/(RT)$ in the exponential must be dimensionless.",

The stoichiometric combustion reaction is $\\text{CH}_4 + 2\\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$. For $1$ mole of $\\text{CH}_4$, $2$ moles of $\\text{O}_2$ are required.

The governing equation simplifies to:\n$\\dfrac{d x_i}{d t} = \\dfrac{\\nu_{i,A} \\mathcal{R}_A}{C_{\\text{tot}}}$\nFor carbon monoxide ($i = \\text{CO}$), the stoichiometric coefficient is $\\nu_{\\text{CO},A} = 0$. Therefore, the rate of change of its mole fraction is:\n$\\dfrac{d x_{\\text{CO}}}{d t} = 0$\nGiven the initial condition $x_{\\text{CO}}(0) = 0$, the mole fraction of $\\text{CO}$ remains zero for all time. Thus, the predicted exit mole fraction for the one-step model is:\n$x_{\\text{CO, one-step}}(\\tau) = 0$\n\n**Model 2: Two-Step Reduced-Chemistry Model**\nThis model involves two reactions, and the full governing equation must be used:\n$\\dfrac{d x_i}{d t} = \\dfrac{1}{C_{\\text{tot}}} \\left( (\\nu_{i,1} \\mathcal{R}_1 + \\nu_{i,2} \\mathcal{R}_2) - x_i (\\Delta \\nu_1 \\mathcal{R}_1 + \\Delta \\nu_2 \\mathcal{R}_2) \\right)$\nwhere reactor conditions ($T, P$) are constant. The terms are defined as:\n- Total molar concentration: $C_{\\text{tot}} = P/(RT)$\n- Reaction rates:\n  $\\mathcal{R}_1 = k_1 (x_{\\text{CH}_4}C_{\\text{tot}})^{1} (x_{\\text{O}_2}C_{\\text{tot}})^{1.5}$\n  $\\mathcal{R}_2 = k_2 (x_{\\text{CO}}C_{\\text{tot}})^{1} (x_{\\text{O}_2}C_{\\text{tot}})^{0.5}$\n- Rate constants:\n  $k_1 = A_1 \\exp(-E_1/RT)$\n  $k_2 = A_2 \\exp(-E_2/RT)$\n- Change in moles for each reaction: $\\Delta \\nu_1 = +0.5$, $\\Delta \\nu_2 = -0.5$.\n\nIn this model, $\\text{CO}$ is an intermediate species. It is produced by the first reaction ($\\nu_{\\text{CO},1} = +1$) and consumed by the second reaction ($\\nu_{\\text{CO},2} = -1$). Its governing equation is non-trivial:\n$\\dfrac{d x_{\\text{CO}}}{d t} = \\dfrac{1}{C_{\\text{tot}}} \\left( (1 \\cdot \\mathcal{R}_1 - 1 \\cdot \\mathcal{R}_2) - x_{\\text{CO}} (0.5 \\cdot \\mathcal{R}_1 - 0.5 \\cdot \\mathcal{R}_2) \\right)$\n\nThis system of six coupled, non-linear ODEs for the mole fractions of all species must be solved numerically.\n\n**Numerical Solution Strategy**\nThe initial value problem for the two-step model is solved by integrating the ODE system from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$. Due to the wide range of reaction timescales (stiffness), which is characteristic of chemical kinetics, a robust implicit ODE solver is required. The `solve_ivp` function from the SciPy library, with the `Radau` method, is an appropriate choice.\n\nFor each test case `(T, P, tau)`:\n1. The one-step model result is analytically $x_{\\text{CO, one-step}}(\\tau) = 0$.\n2. The ODE system for the two-step model is integrated using the initial condition vector $\\vec{x}(0)$ over the time span $[0, \\tau]$.\n3. The mole fraction of carbon monoxide at the final time, $x_{\\text{CO, two-step}}(\\tau)$, is extracted from the numerical solution.\n4. The final result for the test case is computed as the difference $\\Delta x_{\\text{CO}} = x_{\\text{CO, two-step}}(\\tau) - 0 = x_{\\text{CO, two-step}}(\\tau)$.\n\nThe final output will be a list of these $\\Delta x_{\\text{CO}}$ values for all test cases.",

            "problem": "You are tasked with designing a program to compute local first-order parameter sensitivities for the laminar flame speed in a steady, planar, premixed flame modeled with a single-step global reaction. The sensitivities to be computed are $\\partial S_L/\\partial A$, $\\partial S_L/\\partial E_a$, $\\partial S_L/\\partial m$, and $\\partial S_L/\\partial p$. Your program must implement a scientifically consistent thermal-diffusive premixed flame model under the following assumptions and foundations, and produce values in specified units for a given test suite of parameters.\n\nFundamental base and assumptions:\n- Consider a one-dimensional, steady, planar premixed flame with unity Lewis number and constant transport properties. The energy conservation, species conservation, and heat release are the governing bases.\n- The global one-step reaction rate is assumed to be Arrhenius with explicit pressure dependence: $k(T) = A\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{m}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T}\\right)$, where $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $m$ is the global reaction order with respect to pressure, $p$ is the thermodynamic pressure, $p_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is a fixed reference pressure, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n- Adiabatic flame conditions are assumed for the thermal structure, with the adiabatic burned-gas temperature defined by energy balance as $T_b = T_u + \\frac{Q}{c_p}$, where $T_u$ is the unburned-gas temperature, $Q$ is the specific heat release per unit mass of the mixture, and $c_p$ is the mixture specific heat at constant pressure.\n- Use the high-activation-energy asymptotic framework of Frank-Kamenetskii and Zel'dovich. Define the Zel'dovich number as $\\beta = \\dfrac{E_a (T_b - T_u)}{R T_b^2}$ and approximate the effective reaction zone temperature by $T_e = T_b\\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\beta}\\right)$ for $\\beta > 1$.\n- Under thermal-diffusive theory and matched asymptotics for unity Lewis number, relate the laminar flame speed to an effective chemical time scale via $S_L \\sim \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\alpha}{\\tau_c}}$ with $\\tau_c \\approx 1/k(T_e)$, where $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity of the unburned mixture.

            "solution": "The problem has been critically assessed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the classical theory of premixed flame propagation, is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided assumptions and constants allow for the derivation of a unique and meaningful solution. The minor ambiguity in the flame speed scaling relation, $S_L \\sim \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau_c}$, is resolved by adopting the standard interpretation for such problems, which implies a proportionality constant of unity. This leads to the direct algebraic form $S_L = \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau_c}$, from which the sensitivities can be rigorously derived. The test cases are well-chosen to probe different physical regimes of the model, including the high-pressure limit, the low-activation-energy limit, and the zero-pressure-order case, confirming the problem's thoughtful design.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation of the laminar flame speed, $S_L$, and its parameter sensitivities.\n\nFirst, we establish the functional form of the laminar flame speed, $S_L$, based on the provided theoretical framework. The model parameters are the pre-exponential factor $A$, the activation energy $E_a$, the pressure order $m$, and the pressure $p$. The fixed physical constants are the unburned gas temperature $T_u$, the specific heat $c_p$, the heat release $Q$, the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$, the universal gas constant $R$, and the reference pressure $p_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n\nThe adiabatic flame temperature, $T_b$, is constant for all cases as it depends only on fixed thermal properties:\n$$T_b = T_u + \\frac{Q}{c_p}$$\n\nThe Zel'dovich number, $\\beta$, which is a dimensionless measure of the activation energy, depends on $E_a$:\n$$\\beta(E_a) = \\frac{E_a (T_b - T_u)}{R T_b^2}$$\nThe asymptotic theory is valid for large $\\beta$, and the problem states to use the framework for $\\beta > 1$, a condition that holds for all specified test cases.\n\nThe effective reaction zone temperature, $T_e$, is approximated using the high-activation-energy asymptotics:\n$$T_e(E_a) = T_b \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta(E_a)}\\right)$$\n\nThe global one-step Arrhenius reaction rate, $k$, is evaluated at this effective temperature:\n$$k(T_e) = A \\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^m \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_e(E_a)}\\right)$$\n\nThe flame speed, $S_L$, is related to the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ and a characteristic chemical time $\\tau_c$. As specified, we use $\\tau_c \\approx 1/k(T_e)$ and the scaling $S_L \\sim \\sqrt{\\alpha/\\tau_c}$. Interpreting the proportionality constant as unity gives the explicit formula:\n$$S_L(A, E_a, m, p) = \\sqrt{\\alpha k(T_e)} = \\sqrt{\\alpha A \\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^m \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R T_e(E_a)}\\right)}$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$S_L = A^{1/2} \\alpha^{1/2} \\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)^{m/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{2 R T_e(E_a)}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we derive the required first-order partial derivatives.
