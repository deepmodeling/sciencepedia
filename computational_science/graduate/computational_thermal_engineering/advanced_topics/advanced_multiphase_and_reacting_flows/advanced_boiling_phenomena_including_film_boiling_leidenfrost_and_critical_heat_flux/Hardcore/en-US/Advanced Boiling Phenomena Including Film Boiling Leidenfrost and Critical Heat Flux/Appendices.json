            "problem": "A smooth heated metal surface in contact with liquid water at $1$ atmosphere exhibits the Onset of Nucleate Boiling (ONB) when a vapor bubble can stably grow from a pre-existing surface cavity. Consider a single cavity with mouth radius $r$ that hosts a vapor nucleus. Assume the surrounding liquid is at its saturation temperature $T_{sat}$ and the incipient bubble, initially constrained by the cavity, has a radius comparable to the cavity mouth. The stability of the bubble at ONB requires that the additional pressure inside the bubble needed to balance the capillary pressure is provided by the increase in saturation pressure resulting from the wall superheat $\\Delta T_{ONB} = T_{w}-T_{sat}$, where $T_{w}$ is the wall temperature at ONB.\n\nStarting only from the following fundamental bases:\n- The mechanical equilibrium of a curved interface imposes a capillary (Laplace) pressure jump: $p_{v} - p_{l} = 2\\sigma/r$, where $p_{v}$ is the vapor pressure inside the bubble, $p_{l}$ is the liquid pressure, $\\sigma$ is the liquid-vapor surface tension, and $r$ is the radius of curvature (taken here as the cavity mouth radius).\n- The Clausius–Clapeyron relation for the saturation curve gives $\\mathrm{d}p_{sat}/\\mathrm{d}T = h_{fg}/(T\\,\\Delta v)$, where $p_{sat}(T)$ is the saturation pressure as a function of temperature $T$, $h_{fg}$ is the latent heat of vaporization, and $\\Delta v = v_{v}-v_{l}$ is the specific volume change between vapor and liquid. In saturated boiling of water near atmospheric pressure, take $\\Delta v \\approx v_{v}$ so that $\\mathrm{d}p_{sat}/\\mathrm{d}T \\approx h_{fg}\\rho_{v}/T$, with $\\rho_{v}$ the saturated vapor density.\n\nDerive an expression for the minimum wall superheat $\\Delta T_{ONB}$ required to activate a cavity of radius $r$, and then compute its numerical value for water at $1$ atmosphere with the following properties: $\\sigma=0.058$ $\\mathrm{N/m}$, $h_{fg}=2.26\\times 10^{6}$ $\\mathrm{J/kg}$, $\\rho_{v}=0.6$ $\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, $T_{sat}=373$ $\\mathrm{K}$, and $r=5\\times 10^{-6}$ $\\mathrm{m}$. Express the final superheat in $\\mathrm{K}$ and round your answer to four significant figures. As part of your reasoning, qualitatively comment on the sensitivity of $\\Delta T_{ONB}$ to $r$ based on your derived expression; the final numerical answer need only be the computed $\\Delta T_{ONB}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of thermodynamics and fluid mechanics concerning phase change, is well-posed with sufficient information, and uses objective, formal language. The problem asks for the derivation of a standard model for the onset of nucleate boiling, which is a core concept in boiling heat transfer.\n\nThe fundamental condition for the onset of nucleate boiling (ONB) from a pre-existing cavity is that the vapor nucleus must be in mechanical and thermal equilibrium. This equilibrium is unstable, such that any slight increase in wall temperature will cause the bubble to grow.\n\nThe mechanical equilibrium of the hemispherical vapor nucleus at the mouth of the cavity is governed by the Young-Laplace equation. This equation states that the pressure difference across the curved interface is balanced by surface tension. For a bubble of radius $r$, this is given as:\n$$\np_v - p_l = \\frac{2\\sigma}{r}\n$$\nwhere $p_v$ is the pressure of the vapor inside the nucleus, $p_l$ is the pressure of the liquid surrounding it, and $\\sigma$ is the surface tension. The problem assumes the bubble radius is equal to the cavity mouth radius $r$.\n\nThe thermal condition dictates the pressures involved. The vapor inside the nucleus is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with the heated wall, which is at a temperature $T_w$. Therefore, the vapor is saturated at this temperature, and its pressure is the corresponding saturation pressure, $p_v = p_{sat}(T_w)$. The surrounding liquid is at the bulk saturation temperature $T_{sat}$, so the pressure in the liquid far from the wall is $p_l = p_{sat}(T_{sat})$. The problem defines the wall superheat as $\\Delta T_{ONB} = T_w - T_{sat}$.\n\nSubstituting these pressure definitions into the Young-Laplace equation yields the core relationship for bubble stability:\n$$\np_{sat}(T_w) - p_{sat}(T_{sat}) = \\frac{2\\sigma}{r}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the pressure difference required to sustain the curved interface must be generated by the increase in saturation pressure due to the wall superheat.\n\nThe wall superheat $\\Delta T_{ONB}$ required for ONB is typically small. This allows us to approximate the change in saturation pressure, $p_{sat}(T_w) - p_{sat}(T_{sat})$, using a first-order Taylor expansion of the saturation pressure function $p_{sat}(T)$ around the temperature $T_{sat}$:\n$$\np_{sat}(T_w) - p_{sat}(T_{sat}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_{sat}}{\\mathrm{d}T}\\right)_{T=T_{sat}} (T_w - T_{sat})\n$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_{sat}}{\\mathrm{d}T}$ is given by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. The problem provides the specific form for water near atmospheric pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_{sat}}{\\mathrm{d}T} \\approx \\frac{h_{fg}\\rho_v}{T}\n$$\nwhere $h_{fg}$ is the latent heat of vaporization, $\\rho_v$ is the saturated vapor density, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Evaluating this derivative at $T = T_{sat}$, we have:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_{sat}}{\\mathrm{d}T}\\right)_{T=T_{sat}} \\approx \\frac{h_{fg}\\rho_v}{T_{sat}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Taylor expansion for the pressure difference:\n$$\np_{sat}(T_w) - p_{sat}(T_{sat}) \\approx \\frac{h_{fg}\\rho_v}{T_{sat}} (T_w - T_{sat}) = \\frac{h_{fg}\\rho_v}{T_{sat}} \\Delta T_{ONB}\n$$\nNow, we equate the two expressions for the pressure difference: the one from mechanical equilibrium and the one from thermodynamic considerations.\n$$\n\\frac{h_{fg}\\rho_v}{T_{sat}} \\Delta T_{ONB} = \\frac{2\\sigma}{r}\n$$\nSolving this equation for the minimum wall superheat, $\\Delta T_{ONB}$, gives the desired expression:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{ONB} = \\frac{2\\sigma T_{sat}}{h_{fg}\\rho_v r}\n$$\nThis is the well-known Hsu-Rohsenow-Bergles criterion for the incipience of boiling.\n\nQualitatively, this expression reveals the sensitivity of $\\Delta T_{ONB}$ to the cavity radius $r$. The required superheat for activation is inversely proportional to the radius of the nucleation site: $\\Delta T_{ONB} \\propto \\frac{1}{r}$. This means that smaller cavities require a larger wall superheat to become active. As the heat flux to a surface is increased, the wall temperature rises, and progressively smaller cavities are activated, leading to an increase in the number of active nucleation sites.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta T_{ONB}$ using the provided data for water at $1$ atmosphere:\n$\\sigma = 0.058 \\text{ N/m}$\n$T_{sat} = 373 \\text{ K}$\n$h_{fg} = 2.26 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ J/kg}$\n$\\rho_v = 0.6 \\text{ kg/m}^3$\n$r = 5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{ONB} = \\frac{2(0.058 \\, \\mathrm{N/m})(373 \\, \\mathrm{K})}{(2.26 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{J/kg})(0.6 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^3})(5 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m})}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{ONB} = \\frac{43.268 \\, \\mathrm{N \\cdot K / m}}{6.78 \\, \\mathrm{J/m^3}}\n$$\nSince $1 \\, \\mathrm{J} = 1 \\, \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$, the units become $\\mathrm{N \\cdot K / m} / (\\mathrm{N \\cdot m / m^3}) = \\mathrm{N \\cdot K / m} / (\\mathrm{N/m^2}) = \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\n\\Delta T_{ONB} = \\frac{43.268}{6.78} \\, \\mathrm{K} \\approx 6.3817109... \\, \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{ONB} \\approx 6.382 \\, \\mathrm{K}\n$$",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution process involves three main steps: parameter calibration, prediction, and uncertainty analysis.\n\n**1. Parameter Calibration**\nThe primary goal is to find the value of the surface-fluid constant, denoted $\\hat{C}_{sf}$, that best fits the provided experimental data. This is achieved by minimizing the sum of squared residuals (SSR) between the measured heat fluxes, $q^{*}_{\\text{data}}$, and the heat fluxes predicted by the model, $q^{*}(\\Delta T^{*}; C_{sf})$.\nThe objective function to minimize is:\n$$\n\\text{SSR}(C_{sf}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( q^{*}_{\\text{data},i} - q^{*}(\\Delta T^{*}_i; C_{sf}) \\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $N=8$ is the number of data points. This is a nonlinear least squares problem. We will use the `curve_fit` function from the `scipy.optimize` library, which is designed for such tasks. This function takes the model function, the independent variable data ($\\Delta T^{*}$), and the dependent variable data ($q^{*}$) as input.\n\nThe model function, implemented in code, is:\n$$\nf(\\Delta T^{*}; C_{sf}) = \\left( \\frac{(\\Delta T^{*})^{1+m}}{C_{sf} \\, Pr_l^{\\,n}} \\right)^{3} = \\left( \\frac{(\\Delta T^{*})^{1.5}}{C_{sf} \\, (6.2)^{1.7}} \\right)^{3}\n$$\nThe `curve_fit` function returns two items:\n- `popt`: An array containing the optimal parameter values. In this case, `popt[0]` will be our estimate, $\\hat{C}_{sf}$.\n- `pcov`: The estimated covariance matrix of `popt`. The variance of a parameter is the corresponding diagonal element of this matrix.\n\nThe standard uncertainty of the estimated parameter, $\\sigma_C$, is the square root of its variance. Therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_C = \\sqrt{\\texttt{pcov}[0, 0]}\n$$\n\n**2. Prediction of Heat Flux**\nOnce $\\hat{C}_{sf}$ is determined, the model is fully specified. We can use it to predict the dimensionless heat flux $q^{*}$ for any given dimensionless excess temperature $\\Delta T^{*}$. For each of the four values in the prediction test suite ($\\Delta T^{*} = [0.4, 1.5, 2.5, 3.0]$), the predicted heat flux is calculated as:\n$$\nq^{*}_{\\text{pred}} = q^{*}(\\Delta T^{*}_{\\text{test}}; \\hat{C}_{sf}) = \\left( \\frac{(\\Delta T^{*}_{\\text{test}})^{1.5}}{\\hat{C}_{sf} \\, (6.2)^{1.7}} \\right)^{3}\n$$\n\n**3. Uncertainty Propagation and Validity Check**\nFor each prediction, we must also quantify its uncertainty and check its validity.\n\n- **Uncertainty**: The uncertainty in the predicted $q^{*}_{\\text{pred}}$ arises from the uncertainty $\\sigma_C$ in the calibrated parameter $\\hat{C}_{sf}$. Using the first-order uncertainty propagation formula (delta method) provided in the problem statement, the standard uncertainty $\\sigma_{q^{*}}$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{q^{*}} = 3 \\, \\frac{q^{*}_{\\text{pred}}}{\\hat{C}_{sf}} \\, \\sigma_{C}\n$$\nThis formula is derived from the sensitivity of $q^{*}$ to $C_{sf}$: $\\sigma_{q^{*}} \\approx \\left| \\frac{\\partial q^{*}}{\\partial C_{sf}} \\right| \\sigma_{C}$. As given, $\\frac{\\partial q^{*}}{\\partial C_{sf}} = -3 \\frac{q^{*}}{C_{sf}}$. The absolute value is taken, resulting in the provided expression.\n\n- **Validity**: The Rohsenow correlation is only valid within the nucleate boiling regime. The problem defines a simplified validity check using a threshold for the Critical Heat Flux, $q^{*}_{CHF} = 1.0$. If the predicted heat flux $q^{*}_{\\text{pred}}$ exceeds this value, the model is being extrapolated outside its range of applicability, into the transition or film boiling regimes. The boolean validity flag $v$ is thus computed as:\n$$\nv = (q^{*}_{\\text{pred}} \\le 1.0)\n$$\n\nThese calculations will be performed for each of the four test $\\Delta T^{*}$ values. All resulting floating-point numbers will be rounded to $6$ decimal places, and the final results will be aggregated into a single list as specified.",
