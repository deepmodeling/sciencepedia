            "problem": "A dilute suspension of rigid, monodisperse spherical particles is transported in steady, fully developed, laminar flow of a Newtonian liquid through a long circular pipe of radius $R$. The flow is vertical upward. You are to model the system using the Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluid framework with interphase transfer restricted to drag and buoyancy, neglecting added mass, Basset history, lift, and turbulent dispersion. Assume the particle phase is sufficiently dilute that particle–particle interactions and hindered settling are negligible, and that the particle Reynolds number based on the local slip is small enough to justify the creeping-flow limit a posteriori.\n\nGiven:\n- Pipe radius: $R = 0.02 \\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- Carrier liquid: density $\\rho_{f} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, dynamic viscosity $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$.\n- Particles: density $\\rho_{p} = 2500 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, diameter $d_{p} = 100 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Mean axial liquid velocity (single-phase reference): $U_{m} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n- Gravitational acceleration: $g = 9.81 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^{2}}$.\n- Volume fraction of particles: $\\alpha_{p} \\ll 1$ (dilute limit).\n\nIn the Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluid description, adopt a steady algebraic axial momentum balance for the dispersed phase in which the interphase drag force balances the net axial body force difference (gravity minus buoyancy). Take the interphase drag to be represented by the standard drag law for a single isolated sphere with a drag coefficient that is a function of the particle Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re}_{p}$, defined using the slip velocity magnitude $|u_{s}|$ and the carrier liquid properties as $\\mathrm{Re}_{p} = \\rho_{f} d_{p} |u_{s}| / \\mu$. In the creeping-flow limit, use the Stokes expression for the drag coefficient, $C_{d} = 24 / \\mathrm{Re}_{p}$.\n\nUsing only fundamental balances and definitions, derive the local steady slip velocity profile $u_{s}(r)$, where $u_{s} \\equiv u_{p} - u_{f}$ is the axial particle–fluid relative velocity. Then, evaluate the magnitude $|u_{s}(r)|$ numerically for the given properties. State clearly whether the result depends on the radial coordinate $r$. Express your final numerical answer as the magnitude of the slip velocity in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and evaluation of the local steady slip velocity profile, $u_{s}(r)$, for a dilute suspension of particles in a laminar pipe flow. The modeling framework is specified as a steady, algebraic axial momentum balance for the dispersed (particle) phase, where the interphase drag force is balanced by the net body force (gravity minus buoyancy).\n\nLet the vertical upward direction define the positive $z$-axis. The gravitational acceleration vector acts downwards, so its component is $g_z = -g$. The flow is considered one-dimensional in the axial direction.\n\nThe problem's framework allows us to consider the force balance on a single, representative spherical particle, as the suspension is dilute ($\\alpha_p \\ll 1$), implying that particle-particle interactions and the influence of the particle phase on the fluid's bulk properties are negligible. The specified algebraic momentum balance is equivalent to the condition of terminal velocity for a particle, but in a moving fluid, where the velocity of interest is the relative (slip) velocity.\n\nThe forces acting on a single particle in the axial ($z$) direction are:\n$1$. **Gravitational Force ($F_{g,z}$)**: This is the weight of the particle, acting downwards.\n$$F_{g,z} = -m_p g = -\\rho_p V_p g$$\nwhere $\\rho_p$ is the particle density and $V_p$ is the volume of a single spherical particle, given by $V_p = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3$.\n\n$2$. **Buoyancy Force ($F_{b,z}$)**: This is the upward force exerted by the fluid, equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the particle.\n$$F_{b,z} = \\rho_f V_p g$$\nwhere $\\rho_f$ is the fluid density.\n\n$3$. **Drag Force ($F_{d,z}$)**: This force opposes the relative motion between the particle and the fluid. The slip velocity is defined as $u_s = u_p - u_f$, where $u_p$ and $u_f$ are the particle and fluid axial velocities, respectively. The drag force is given by the standard formula:\n$$F_d = \\frac{1}{2} C_d \\rho_f A_p |u_s| u_s$$\nFor one-dimensional axial flow, the drag force vector is opposite to the slip velocity vector. The axial component is thus proportional to $-u_s$. The problem specifies using the Stokes drag law for the creeping-flow limit, where the drag coefficient $C_d$ is:\n$$C_d = \\frac{24}{\\mathrm{Re}_p}$$\nThe particle Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}_p$, is defined based on the slip velocity:\n$$\\mathrm{Re}_p = \\frac{\\rho_f d_p |u_s|}{\\mu}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_d$ into the drag force formula, where $A_p = \\frac{1}{4}\\pi d_p^2$ is the particle's projected area, we obtain the Stokes drag force:\n$$F_{d,z} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{24\\mu}{\\rho_f d_p |u_s|} \\right) \\rho_f \\left( \\frac{\\pi d_p^2}{4} \\right) |u_s| u_s = -3\\pi\\mu d_p u_s$$\n\nAccording to the problem, the steady-state momentum balance requires the sum of these forces to be zero:\n$$F_{g,z} + F_{b,z} + F_{d,z} = 0$$\n$$-\\rho_p V_p g + \\rho_f V_p g - 3\\pi\\mu d_p u_s = 0$$\nWe can now solve for the slip velocity $u_s$:\n$$3\\pi\\mu d_p u_s = (\\rho_f - \\rho_p) V_p g$$\nSubstituting the expression for the particle volume, $V_p = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3$:\n$$3\\pi\\mu d_p u_s = (\\rho_f - \\rho_p) \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3\\right) g$$\n$$u_s = \\frac{(\\rho_f - \\rho_p) g \\pi d_p^3}{18\\pi\\mu d_p}$$\n$$u_s = \\frac{d_p^2 g}{18\\mu}(\\rho_f - \\rho_p)$$\nThis derived expression for $u_s$ represents the local steady slip velocity. We observe that it depends only on the physical properties of the particles and the fluid, and on the gravitational acceleration. It does not depend on the radial coordinate $r$. Therefore, the slip velocity profile $u_s(r)$ is a constant, independent of position within the pipe.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically with the given values:\n- Particle diameter: $d_p = 100 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Gravitational acceleration: $g = 9.81 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n- Fluid dynamic viscosity: $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$\n- Fluid density: $\\rho_f = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n- Particle density: $\\rho_p = 2500 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n\n$$u_s = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-4})^2 \\times 9.81}{18 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3})} (1000 - 2500)$$\n$$u_s = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times 9.81}{1.8 \\times 10^{-2}} (-1500)$$\n$$u_s = \\frac{9.81 \\times (-1500)}{1.8} \\times 10^{-6}$$\n$$u_s = -8175 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m/s} = -0.008175 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates that the particle velocity is less than the fluid velocity ($u_p < u_f$), as the denser particles settle relative to the upward-flowing fluid.\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the slip velocity, $|u_s(r)|$:\n$$|u_s(r)| = |-0.008175 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}| = 0.008175 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nAs requested, this result is given to four significant figures.\n\nFinally, we perform the a posteriori check on the particle Reynolds number to confirm the consistency of the creeping-flow assumption:\n$$\\mathrm{Re}_p = \\frac{\\rho_f d_p |u_s|}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1000) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (0.008175)}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = 0.8175$$\nThe Stokes drag law is most accurate for $\\mathrm{Re}_p \\ll 1$ (typically $\\mathrm{Re}_p < 0.1$). A value of $\\mathrm{Re}_p \\approx 0.82$ indicates that inertial effects, which are neglected in the Stokes law, are beginning to be significant. However, since the problem explicitly instructs the use of the Stokes expression, the derived result is the correct solution within the specified model constraints. The derived slip velocity is indeed independent of the radial coordinate $r$.",

            "problem": "Consider a dispersed gas phase of monodisperse bubbles of diameter $d_b$ rising through a continuous liquid phase in a vertical column. The flow and thermal fields are modeled using an Eulerian–Eulerian two-fluid framework, where each phase obeys its own mass, momentum, and energy equations with interphase exchange terms. In the energy equations, the interphase heat transfer is represented by a volumetric source term of the form $S_T = h_i a_i \\left( T_g - T_c \\right)$, where $h_i$ is the interphase heat transfer coefficient, $a_i$ is the interfacial area density, and $T_g$ and $T_c$ are the gas and continuous-phase temperatures, respectively.

            "solution": "The objective is to derive an expression for the interphase Nusselt number, $Nu_i$, as a function of the physical properties of the continuous phase and the flow conditions. This will be accomplished in two stages. First, we will nondimensionalize the governing energy equation to formally establish the dependence of heat transfer on the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. Second, we will select an appropriate and physically justified correlation to specify this functional dependence.\n\nThe problem considers heat transfer from a single bubble of diameter $d_b$ to a surrounding continuous liquid phase. The analysis is most conveniently performed in a frame of reference co-moving with the bubble. In this frame, the bubble is stationary, and the continuous phase approaches with a far-field velocity of magnitude $u_{sl}$. The steady-state energy equation for the continuous phase, neglecting viscous dissipation and internal heat generation, is the convection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\rho_c c_{p,c} (\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla T) = k_c \\nabla^2 T\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{u}$ and $T$ are the local velocity and temperature fields in the continuous phase, respectively. The physical properties $\\rho_c$, $c_{p,c}$, and $k_c$ are assumed to be constant.\n\nThe boundary conditions for the temperature field are:\n1. At the bubble surface, $r = d_b/2$: The temperature is assumed to be uniform, $T = T_s$. For the purpose of defining the heat transfer coefficient, this surface temperature is the reference temperature driving the heat flux. It is typically assumed to be close to the bulk gas temperature, $T_g$.\n2. Far from the bubble, $r \\to \\infty$: The temperature approaches the bulk temperature of the continuous phase, $T \\to T_c$.\n\nTo nondimensionalize the problem, we introduce the following dimensionless variables:\n- Dimensionless temperature: $\\Theta = \\dfrac{T - T_c}{T_s - T_c}$\n- Dimensionless velocity: $\\boldsymbol{u}^* = \\dfrac{\\boldsymbol{u}}{u_{sl}}$\n- Dimensionless spatial coordinates, using the bubble diameter $d_b$ as the characteristic length scale: $\\boldsymbol{x}^* = \\dfrac{\\boldsymbol{x}}{d_b}$. Consequently, the gradient operator becomes $\\nabla = \\dfrac{1}{d_b} \\nabla^*$.\n\nSubstituting these into the energy equation:\n$$\n\\rho_c c_{p,c} \\left( (u_{sl} \\boldsymbol{u}^*) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{d_b} \\nabla^* \\left( (T_s - T_c)\\Theta + T_c \\right) \\right) \\right) = k_c \\left( \\frac{1}{d_b^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\left( (T_s - T_c)\\Theta + T_c \\right) \\right)\n$$\nSince $T_s$, $T_c$, and $u_{sl}$ are constants, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho_c c_{p,c} u_{sl} \\frac{T_s - T_c}{d_b} (\\boldsymbol{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\Theta) = k_c \\frac{T_s - T_c}{d_b^2} \\nabla^{*2} \\Theta\n$$\nDividing both sides by $\\dfrac{k_c(T_s - T_c)}{d_b^2}$ yields the dimensionless energy equation:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\rho_c u_{sl} d_b}{\\mu_c} \\right) \\left( \\frac{c_{p,c} \\mu_c}{k_c} \\right) (\\boldsymbol{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\Theta) = \\nabla^{*2} \\Theta\n$$\nThe dimensionless groups that appear are the Reynolds number, $Re_p = \\dfrac{\\rho_c u_{sl} d_b}{\\mu_c}$, and the Prandtl number, $Pr = \\dfrac{c_{p,c} \\mu_c}{k_c}$. The dimensionless equation is thus:\n$$\nRe_p Pr (\\boldsymbol{u}^* \\cdot \\nabla^* \\Theta) = \\nabla^{*2} \\Theta\n$$\nThe dimensionless boundary conditions are $\\Theta=1$ at the surface $r^* = 1/2$ and $\\Theta=0$ as $r^* \\to \\infty$. The solution to this system, $\\Theta(\\boldsymbol{x}^*)$, depends only on the parameters $Re_p$ and $Pr$.\n\nThe interphase heat transfer coefficient, $h_i$, is defined from the total heat transfer rate $Q$ from the bubble surface $A_b = \\pi d_b^2$:\n$$\nQ = h_i A_b (T_s - T_c)\n$$\nThe heat rate $Q$ is also obtained by integrating the local heat flux over the bubble surface:\n$$\nQ = \\int_{A_b} \\left( -k_c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n} \\right) dS\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n}$ is the normal derivative at the surface, pointing into the continuous phase. In spherical coordinates, this is $\\left. -k_c \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=d_b/2}$.\nEquating the two expressions for $Q$ and solving for $h_i$:\n$$\nh_i = \\frac{1}{A_b(T_s-T_c)} \\int_{A_b} \\left( -k_c \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=d_b/2} \\right) dS\n$$\nNow, we express the temperature gradient in dimensionless form: $\\dfrac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} = \\dfrac{T_s - T_c}{d_b} \\dfrac{\\partial \\Theta}{\\partial r^*}$.\n$$\nh_i = \\frac{-k_c}{A_b d_b} \\int_{A_b} \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Theta}{\\partial r^*} \\right|_{r^*=1/2} dS\n$$\nThe Nusselt number, $Nu_i$, is defined as the dimensionless heat transfer coefficient:\n$$\nNu_i = \\frac{h_i d_b}{k_c} = -\\frac{1}{A_b} \\int_{A_b} \\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Theta}{\\partial r^*} \\right|_{r^*=1/2} dS = - \\overline{\\left. \\frac{\\partial \\Theta}{\\partial r^*} \\right|_{r^*=1/2}}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the Nusselt number is the area-averaged dimensionless temperature gradient at the bubble surface. Since the dimensionless temperature field $\\Theta$ is a function of $Re_p$ and $Pr$, the Nusselt number must also be a function of these two dimensionless groups: $Nu_i = f(Re_p, Pr)$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to provide an explicit form for this function using an appropriate correlation. The problem's assumption of a \"thin thermal boundary layer\" guides the choice. This condition arises at high Péclet numbers ($Pe_p = Re_p Pr \\gg 1$), where convection dominates heat transfer. A widely used and well-justified empirical correlation for heat transfer from a rigid sphere in forced convection is the Ranz-Marshall correlation:\n$$\nNu_i = 2.0 + 0.6 Re_p^{1/2} Pr^{1/3}\n$$\nThis correlation is appropriate for several reasons:\n1. It correctly reduces to the theoretical limit of $Nu_i = 2.0$ for pure conduction in a stagnant medium ($Re_p = 0$).\n2. The convective term, $0.6 Re_p^{1/2} Pr^{1/3}$, is consistent with theoretical boundary layer analysis for flows at moderate to high Reynolds numbers, which aligns with the \"thin thermal boundary layer\" assumption.\n3. It is a standard correlation used in multiphase flow modeling for dispersed particles or bubbles, particularly when surfaces are assumed to be immobile (e.g., due to surfactants).\n\nTo obtain the final expression, we substitute the definitions of $Re_p$ and $Pr$ into the Ranz-Marshall correlation:\n$$\nNu_i = 2 + 0.6 \\left( \\frac{\\rho_c u_{sl} d_b}{\\mu_c} \\right)^{1/2} \\left( \\frac{c_{p,c} \\mu_c}{k_c} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the interphase Nusselt number, $Nu_i$, as a function of the specified physical properties and flow parameters.",
