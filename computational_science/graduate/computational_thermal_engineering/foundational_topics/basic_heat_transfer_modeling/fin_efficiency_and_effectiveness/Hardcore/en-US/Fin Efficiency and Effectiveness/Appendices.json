            "problem": "A straight, uniform fin of length $L$, cross-sectional area $A$, perimeter $P$, and thermal conductivity $k$ is attached to a wall at $x=0$ and extends into a fluid at ambient temperature $T_{\\infty}$. The base of the fin at $x=0$ is held at a uniform temperature $T_{b}$, with $T_{b}  T_{\\infty}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a standard, well-posed problem in heat transfer that is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by establishing the governing differential equation for the temperature distribution along the fin. Consider a differential control volume of the fin of length $dx$ located at a distance $x$ from the base. Under steady-state conditions, an energy balance on this element requires that the rate of heat conducted into the element at $x$ equals the sum of the rate of heat conducted out at $x+dx$ and the rate of heat lost by convection from the surface of the element.\n$$ \\dot{Q}_x = \\dot{Q}_{x+dx} + d\\dot{Q}_{\\text{conv}} $$\nAccording to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the rate of heat conduction is given by $\\dot{Q}_x = -kA \\frac{dT}{dx}$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. The heat conducted out at $x+dx$ can be expressed using a Taylor series expansion:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{x+dx} = \\dot{Q}_x + \\frac{d\\dot{Q}_x}{dx}dx $$\nThe heat loss by convection from the differential surface area $dA_s = Pdx$ is given by Newton's law of cooling:\n$$ d\\dot{Q}_{\\text{conv}} = h(Pdx)(T(x) - T_{\\infty}) $$\nwhere $h$ is the convection coefficient, $P$ is the perimeter, and $T_{\\infty}$ is the ambient fluid temperature.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the energy balance yields:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_x = \\left(\\dot{Q}_x + \\frac{d\\dot{Q}_x}{dx}dx\\right) + hP(T - T_{\\infty})dx $$\n$$ -\\frac{d\\dot{Q}_x}{dx} - hP(T - T_{\\infty}) = 0 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\dot{Q}_x$:\n$$ -\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-kA\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right) - hP(T - T_{\\infty}) = 0 $$\nFor constant $k$ and $A$, this simplifies to:\n$$ kA\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} - hP(T - T_{\\infty}) = 0 $$\nTo simplify this equation, we introduce the excess temperature, $\\theta(x) = T(x) - T_{\\infty}$. Since $T_{\\infty}$ is a constant, we have $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\frac{dT}{dx}$ and $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} - \\frac{hP}{kA}\\theta = 0 $$\nWe define the fin parameter $m$ as $m = \\sqrt{\\frac{hP}{kA}}$. The governing differential equation is then:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} - m^2\\theta = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.\n\nThe boundary conditions are derived from the physical constraints described in the problem.\n$1$. At the fin base ($x=0$), the temperature is fixed at $T_b$. Thus, the excess temperature is $\\theta(0) = T_b - T_{\\infty}$. We denote this constant as $\\theta_b$.\n$$ \\theta(0) = \\theta_b $$\n$2$. At the fin tip ($x=L$), the fin is thermally insulated. This implies that there is no heat flux across the tip surface. From Fourier's law, this means the temperature gradient is zero.\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = 0 $$\nThe general solution to the governing ODE can be written in terms of hyperbolic functions:\n$$ \\theta(x) = C_1 \\cosh(mx) + C_2 \\sinh(mx) $$\nWe apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ \\theta(0) = \\theta_b = C_1 \\cosh(0) + C_2 \\sinh(0) \\implies C_1 = \\theta_b $$\nSo the solution takes the form $\\theta(x) = \\theta_b \\cosh(mx) + C_2 \\sinh(mx)$.\nTo apply the second boundary condition, we first find the derivative:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = m\\theta_b \\sinh(mx) + mC_2 \\cosh(mx) $$\nApplying the condition at $x=L$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = m\\theta_b \\sinh(mL) + mC_2 \\cosh(mL) = 0 $$\n$$ C_2 = -\\theta_b \\frac{\\sinh(mL)}{\\cosh(mL)} = -\\theta_b \\tanh(mL) $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the general solution gives the temperature distribution:\n$$ \\theta(x) = \\theta_b \\cosh(mx) - \\theta_b \\tanh(mL) \\sinh(mx) = \\theta_b \\left( \\cosh(mx) - \\frac{\\sinh(mL)}{\\cosh(mL)}\\sinh(mx) \\right) $$\nUsing the identity $\\cosh(a-b) = \\cosh(a)\\cosh(b) - \\sinh(a)\\sinh(b)$, we can write this more compactly:\n$$ \\theta(x) = \\frac{\\theta_b}{\\cosh(mL)} \\left( \\cosh(mL)\\cosh(mx) - \\sinh(mL)\\sinh(mx) \\right) = \\theta_b \\frac{\\cosh(m(L-x))}{\\cosh(mL)} $$\n\nNext, we derive the fin efficiency, $\\eta_f$. It is defined as the ratio of the actual heat transfer rate from the fin, $q_f$, to the maximum possible heat transfer rate, $q_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$ \\eta_f = \\frac{q_f}{q_{\\text{max}}} $$\nThe actual heat transfer rate, $q_f$, is the heat conducted into the fin at its base, which must equal the total heat convected from its surface in steady state.\n$$ q_f = -kA \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} $$\nUsing the derivative we found earlier, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = m\\theta_b \\sinh(mx) + mC_2 \\cosh(mx)$, with $C_2 = -\\theta_b\\tanh(mL)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = m\\theta_b \\sinh(0) - m\\theta_b \\tanh(mL) \\cosh(0) = -m\\theta_b \\tanh(mL) $$\nSo, the actual heat transfer rate is:\n$$ q_f = -kA(-m\\theta_b \\tanh(mL)) = kAm\\theta_b \\tanh(mL) $$\nThe maximum heat transfer rate, $q_{\\text{max}}$, would occur if the entire fin surface were at the base temperature $T_b$. The total surface area for convection is $A_s = PL$.\n$$ q_{\\text{max}} = h A_s (T_b - T_{\\infty}) = h(PL)\\theta_b $$\nThe efficiency is therefore:\n$$ \\eta_f = \\frac{kAm\\theta_b \\tanh(mL)}{hPL\\theta_b} = \\frac{kA}{hPL}m\\tanh(mL) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $m^2 = \\frac{hP}{kA}$, we get $\\frac{kA}{hP} = \\frac{1}{m^2}$:\n$$ \\eta_f = \\frac{1}{m^2L}m\\tanh(mL) = \\frac{\\tanh(mL)}{mL} $$\nThis is the exact expression for the efficiency of a fin with an insulated tip.\n\nThe problem requires a leading-order expression for $\\eta_f$ in the limit of a large dimensionless fin length, i.e., $mL \\to \\infty$. We analyze the behavior of the hyperbolic tangent function:\n$$ \\tanh(z) = \\frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}} = \\frac{1 - e^{-2z}}{1 + e^{-2z}} $$\nAs $z \\to \\infty$, the term $e^{-2z}$ approaches $0$, and thus $\\tanh(z) \\to 1$.\nFor large $mL$, we have $\\tanh(mL) \\approx 1$. Substituting this into the efficiency expression provides the leading-order asymptotic approximation:\n$$ \\eta_f \\approx \\frac{1}{mL} $$\n\nFinally, we discuss the role of exponential decay. The temperature distribution is $\\theta(x) = \\theta_b \\frac{\\cosh(m(L-x))}{\\cosh(mL)}$. Let's examine this in the limit of large $mL$. Using the exponential definition of cosh, $\\cosh(z) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}e^z$ for large $z$:\n$$ \\theta(x) \\approx \\theta_b \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(e^{m(L-x)} + e^{-m(L-x)})}{\\frac{1}{2}e^{mL}} = \\theta_b (e^{-mx} + e^{-m(2L-x)}) $$\nAs $L \\to \\infty$, the term $e^{-m(2L-x)}$ vanishes for any fixed $x$. The temperature distribution approaches that of a semi-infinite fin:\n$$ \\theta(x) = \\theta_b e^{-mx} $$\nThis solution shows that the excess temperature decays exponentially along the fin from its base value $\\theta_b$. The approach to the semi-infinite fin limit is governed by the decay of this exponential function. The characteristic decay length scale is the value of $x$ for which the exponent becomes $-1$. Setting $mx=1$, we find this length scale to be $x = 1/m$. When the fin's physical length $L$ is much greater than this characteristic length (i.e., $L \\gg 1/m$, or $mL \\gg 1$), the temperature at the tip has decayed to a very small fraction of the base temperature difference, $e^{-mL}$, and the heat flux at the tip also becomes negligible. This justifies the approximation of a long fin by a semi-infinite one and explains why the insulated tip boundary condition holds naturally for very long fins, as $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} \\propto e^{-mL} \\to 0$. The exponential decay, with its characteristic length $1/m = \\sqrt{kA/hP}$, is the fundamental physical principle controlling this limiting behavior.",

Critique of $\\epsilon_f$ as a Sole Metric**\nThe relationship between $R$ and $\\epsilon_f$ can be formally derived:\n$$R = \\frac{Q}{Q_0} = \\frac{h(A_p - N A_b)\\Theta_b + N q_f}{h A_p \\Theta_b} = 1 - \\frac{N A_b}{A_p} + \\frac{N q_f}{h A_p \\Theta_b}$$\nSubstituting $q_f = \\epsilon_f h A_b \\Theta_b$:\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{N A_b}{A_p} + \\frac{N (\\epsilon_f h A_b \\Theta_b)}{h A_p \\Theta_b} = 1 - \\frac{N A_b}{A_p} + \\epsilon_f \\frac{N A_b}{A_p}$$\n$$R = 1 + (\\epsilon_f - 1)\\left(\\frac{N A_b}{A_p}\\right)$$\nThis equation shows that the enhancement ratio $R$ depends not only on the fin effectiveness $\\epsilon_f$, but also critically on the total fin footprint fraction, $\\frac{N A_b}{A_p}$. In our case, this fraction is exceedingly small:\n$$\\frac{N A_b}{A_p} = \\frac{10 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2)}{1.000\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$R = 1 + (82.2 - 1)(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 1 + (81.2)(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) = 1 + 0.00406 = 1.00406$$\nThe calculation is consistent. The counterexample is successful: a very high fin effectiveness ($\\epsilon_f \\approx 82$) leads to a negligible overall heat transfer enhancement ($R \\approx 1.004$) because the fins occupy a minuscule fraction of the total available surface area.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. A large fin effectiveness $\\epsilon_f \\gg 1$ guarantees a large percentage increase in plate heat transfer, regardless of how small the fin footprint area is relative to the plate area.\nThis statement is demonstrably false. Our numerical calculation provides a direct counterexample: $\\epsilon_f \\approx 82$, which is much greater than $1$, yet the percentage increase in heat transfer is only $0.4\\%$. The derived relation $R = 1 + (\\epsilon_f - 1)(N A_b/A_p)$ proves that the enhancement is proportional to the footprint fraction, which this statement incorrectly neglects.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. Even if $\\epsilon_f \\gg 1$ for each fin, the overall enhancement $R$ can be arbitrarily close to $1$ when the total fin footprint fraction $N A_b/A_p$ is very small; thus $\\epsilon_f$ alone is not a sufficient design metric.\nThis statement accurately reflects the findings of our analysis. The formula $R = 1 + (\\epsilon_f - 1)(N A_b/A_p)$ shows that if the footprint fraction $N A_b/A_p$ approaches zero, the enhancement term $(\\epsilon_f - 1)(N A_b/A_p)$ also approaches zero, and $R$ approaches $1$. This confirms that high effectiveness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for significant heat transfer enhancement; the area coverage is also a critical factor.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. Whenever $\\epsilon_f  1$ for each fin, the overall surface efficiency of the finned plate must exceed $0.90$.\nThe overall surface efficiency is $\\eta_o = Q/Q_{max}$, where $Q_{max} = h A_{total} \\Theta_b$ and $A_{total}$ is the total exposed area, $A_{total} = (A_p - N A_b) + N A_f$. Fin surface area is $A_f = P L = (0.021\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 4.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$. We can fabricate a counterexample. Consider a very long fin made of a poor conductor, such that its fin efficiency $\\eta_f = q_f/(h A_f \\Theta_b)$ is low. For example, let $\\eta_f = 0.5$. The overall efficiency can be written as $\\eta_o = 1 - \\frac{N A_f}{A_{total}}(1-\\eta_f)$. If we cover a large fraction of the base with fins, e.g., $\\frac{N A_f}{A_{total}} = 0.9$, then $\\eta_o = 1 - 0.9(1-0.5) = 1 - 0.45 = 0.55$, which is less than $0.90$. We must ensure $\\epsilon_f > 1$ in this case. $\\epsilon_f = \\eta_f (A_f/A_b)$. For a fin where the ratio of surface area to base area $A_f/A_b$ is large (e.g., $A_f/A_b = 20$), we would have $\\epsilon_f = 0.5 \\times 20 = 10 > 1$. Thus, it is possible to have $\\epsilon_f > 1$ while $\\eta_o  0.90$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. Ranking fin arrays for a fixed convection environment should be based solely on $\\epsilon_f$; the added surface area and base-area occupancy can be neglected in the comparison.\nThis statement is equivalent to the fallacy addressed by the problem. As shown by the relation $R = 1 + (\\epsilon_f - 1)(N A_b/A_p)$, neglecting base-area occupancy ($N A_b$) and added surface area (which influences $\\epsilon_f$) leads to an incomplete and often incorrect assessment of performance. A fin array with a lower $\\epsilon_f$ but much larger area coverage can easily outperform an array with a higher $\\epsilon_f$ but minimal area coverage.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "Consider a straight, slender, one-dimensional fin of uniform cross-sectional area $A$ and perimeter $P$, made of a solid with thermal conductivity $k$, extending a length $L$ from a base at temperature $T_b$ into a fluid at ambient temperature $T_\\infty$. The lateral surface of the fin is exposed to a fluid with a uniform convective heat transfer coefficient $h$. The tip of the fin at $x=L$ is exposed to convection with coefficient $h_t$ over the tip area $A_t$. Define the excess temperature as $\\theta(x) = T(x) - T_\\infty$ and the base excess temperature $\\theta_b = T_b - T_\\infty$. Under steady-state conditions with negligible axial heat generation and constant properties, the fin is governed by a linear, second-order ordinary differential equation with a convective (Robin) boundary condition at the tip. The fin efficiency $\\eta_f$ is defined as the ratio of the total heat transfer rate from the fin to the hypothetical heat transfer rate if the entire fin were at the base excess temperature, i.e., $\\eta_f = q_f/\\left(h P L \\theta_b\\right)$, where $q_f$ is the actual heat transfer rate conducted at the base.\n\nYour task is to implement a finite difference scheme that:\n- Discretizes the governing ordinary differential equation on a uniform grid with spacing $\\Delta x$ using a second-order central difference approximation in the interior and a first-order one-sided difference for the convective tip boundary condition at $x=L$.\n- Enforces a Dirichlet boundary condition at the base $x=0$ with $\\theta(0)=\\theta_b$.\n- Computes the discrete temperature field, then computes the base heat rate $q_f$ using a second-order one-sided finite difference approximation of the derivative at $x=0$.\n- Computes the fin efficiency $\\eta_f$ from the discrete solution.\n\nTo quantify accuracy, you must also compute a reference value of $\\eta_f$ based on the exact closed-form solution of the governing linear ordinary differential equation with the same boundary conditions, and then evaluate the absolute relative error in $\\eta_f$ as a function of the grid spacing $\\Delta x$.\n\nUse the following constants and units:\n- Thermal conductivity $k$ in $\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$.\n- Convective heat transfer coefficients $h$ and $h_t$ in $\\mathrm{W/(m^2\\cdot K)}$.\n- Geometric quantities $L$ in $\\mathrm{m}$, $A$ and $A_t$ in $\\mathrm{m^2}$, $P$ in $\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Temperatures in $\\mathrm{K}$; use a base excess temperature $\\theta_b = 1$ so that the fin efficiency remains dimensionless.

The physical parameters provided for the test cases are realistic for common engineering materials (e.g., aluminum, copper) and convection scenarios. The definitions are standard in the field of heat transfer.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem describes a linear, second-order ODE with two boundary conditions (one Dirichlet at the base, one Robin at the tip). This constitutes a well-posed boundary value problem, for which a unique, stable, and meaningful analytical solution exists. The numerical task is also well-posed; the specified finite difference scheme leads to a system of linear equations that is non-singular and solvable.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. All parameters, methods, and evaluation criteria are explicitly defined, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary data for both the analytical solution and the numerical implementation are provided. The units are consistent. The structure of the numerical scheme is fully specified. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The observation that fin efficiency $\\eta_f$ can exceed $1$ is a valid consequence of the provided definition $\\eta_f = q_f/\\left(h P L \\theta_b\\right)$, which defines the ideal heat transfer based only on the lateral fin area, while the actual heat transfer $q_f$ includes contributions from both the lateral area and the tip area.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, complete, and objective. The task is a rigorous and standard verification and validation exercise in computational thermal engineering. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution Design\n\nThe solution involves both an analytical derivation for a reference value and a numerical implementation based on the finite difference method, as specified.\n\n**1. Analytical Solution**\n\nThe governing equation for the excess temperature $\\theta(x) = T(x) - T_\\infty$ in a fin with uniform properties is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} - m^2 \\theta = 0 $$\nwhere the fin parameter $m$ is defined as $m = \\sqrt{\\frac{hP}{kA}}$. The boundary conditions in terms of $\\theta$ are:\n1. Base ($x=0$): $\\theta(0) = \\theta_b$\n2. Tip ($x=L$): Heat conduction to the tip equals convection from the tip. With $A_t=A$, this is $-k A \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}|_{L} = h_t A \\theta(L)$, which simplifies to $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}|_{L} + \\frac{h_t}{k} \\theta(L) = 0$.\n\nThe general solution to the ODE is $\\theta(x) = C_1 \\cosh(m(L-x)) + C_2 \\sinh(m(L-x))$. Applying the boundary conditions allows us to solve for the constants, yielding the standard solution for the temperature distribution.\n\nThe heat transfer rate at the base is given by Fourier's law: $q_f = -kA \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}|_{x=0}$. Differentiating the general solution and applying the boundary conditions yields the well-known expression for the heat rate from a fin with a convective tip:\n$$ q_f = \\sqrt{hPkA} \\theta_b \\frac{\\sinh(mL) + (h_t/mk) \\cosh(mL)}{\\cosh(mL) + (h_t/mk) \\sinh(mL)} $$\nThe fin efficiency, $\\eta_f$, is defined as the ratio of this actual heat transfer rate to the ideal rate if the entire lateral surface were at the base temperature, $q_{ideal} = hPL\\theta_b$.\n$$ \\eta_f^{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{q_f}{hPL\\theta_b} = \\frac{\\sqrt{hPkA}}{hPL} \\frac{\\sinh(mL) + (h_t/mk) \\cosh(mL)}{\\cosh(mL) + (h_t/mk) \\sinh(mL)} $$\nSince $m = \\sqrt{hP/kA}$, the pre-factor simplifies: $\\frac{\\sqrt{hPkA}}{hPL} = \\frac{m k A}{hPL} = \\frac{m k A}{(m^2 k A) L} = \\frac{1}{mL}$. Thus, the exact efficiency is:\n$$ \\eta_f^{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{1}{mL} \\frac{\\sinh(mL) + (h_t/mk) \\cosh(mL)}{\\cosh(mL) + (h_t/mk) \\sinh(mL)} $$\nFor the special case of an adiabatic tip ($h_t=0$), this simplifies to the classic result $\\eta_f^{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\frac{\\tanh(mL)}{mL}$.\n\n**2. Finite Difference Formulation**\n\nThe fin domain of length $L$ is discretized into $N$ uniform segments of length $\\Delta x = L/N$, creating $N+1$ nodes indexed $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N$. Let $\\theta_i$ be the numerical approximation of $\\theta(x_i)$.\n\n- **Interior Nodes ($i=1, \\dots, N-1$)**: The ODE $\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} - m^2 \\theta = 0$ is discretized using a second-order central difference for the second derivative:\n$$ \\frac{\\theta_{i-1} - 2\\theta_i + \\theta_{i+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2} - m^2 \\theta_i = 0 $$\nRearranging gives a linear algebraic equation for each interior node:\n$$ \\theta_{i-1} - (2 + m^2(\\Delta x)^2) \\theta_i + \\theta_{i+1} = 0 $$\n\n- **Boundary Nodes**:\n    - **Base ($i=0$)**: The Dirichlet condition is applied directly: $\\theta_0 = \\theta_b$. Since $\\theta_b=1$ is specified, $\\theta_0=1$. This value is substituted into the equation for node $i=1$.\n    - **Tip ($i=N$)**: The Robin BC $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}|_{L} + \\frac{h_t}{k} \\theta(L) = 0$ is discretized using a first-order backward difference for the derivative, as specified:\n    $$ \\frac{\\theta_N - \\theta_{N-1}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{h_t}{k} \\theta_N = 0 $$\n    Rearranging gives the final equation of the system:\n    $$ -\\theta_{N-1} + \\left(1 + \\frac{h_t \\Delta x}{k}\\right) \\theta_N = 0 $$\n\nThis formulation results in a system of $N$ linear equations for the $N$ unknown temperatures $\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_N$. In matrix form, $\\mathbf{M}\\vec{\\theta} = \\vec{b}$, where $\\vec{\\theta} = [\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_N]^T$, $\\mathbf{M}$ is an $N \\times N$ tridiagonal matrix, and $\\vec{b}$ is a vector representing the boundary condition contribution. Specifically:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-(2+c)  1  0  \\cdots  0 \\\\\n1  -(2+c)  1  \\cdots  0 \\\\\n\\vdots  \\ddots  \\ddots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n0  \\cdots  1  -(2+c)  1 \\\\\n0  \\cdots  0  -1  1+d\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\vec{b} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\theta_b \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $c = m^2(\\Delta x)^2$ and $d = \\frac{h_t \\Delta x}{k}$. This system can be solved efficiently to find the discrete temperature field $\\theta_i$.\n\n**3. Numerical Fin Efficiency and Error Calculation**\n\nThe base heat rate $q_f$ is computed using the specified second-order forward difference formula for the derivative at $x=0$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{d\\theta}{dx}\\right|_{x=0} \\approx \\frac{-3\\theta_0 + 4\\theta_1 - \\theta_2}{2\\Delta x} $$\nThe numerical heat rate is then:\n$$ q_f^{\\mathrm{FD}} = -kA \\left( \\frac{-3\\theta_0 + 4\\theta_1 - \\theta_2}{2\\Delta x} \\right) $$\nThe numerical fin efficiency is calculated using the given definition:\n$$ \\eta_f^{\\mathrm{FD}} = \\frac{q_f^{\\mathrm{FD}}}{hPL\\theta_b} $$\nWith $\\theta_0=\\theta_b=1$, this becomes:\n$$ \\eta_f^{\\mathrm{FD}} = \\frac{-kA(-3 + 4\\theta_1 - \\theta_2)}{2hPL\\Delta x} $$\n\nFinally, for each grid resolution $N$, the absolute relative error $e$ is computed by comparing the numerical result to the exact solution:\n$$ e = \\frac{\\left|\\eta_f^{\\mathrm{FD}} - \\eta_f^{\\mathrm{exact}}\\right|}{\\left|\\eta_f^{\\mathrm{exact}}\\right|} $$\n\nThe overall algorithm consists of iterating through each set of physical parameters (test cases) and for each case, iterating through the prescribed grid resolutions $N$, calculating and storing the error $e$ at each step.",
