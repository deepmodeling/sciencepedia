In wall-bounded turbulence and laminar boundary layers, it is standard to introduce a velocity scale $u_{\\tau}$, called the friction velocity, by defining the wall shear stress $\\tau_{w}$ to be equal to the dynamic pressure scale formed from $u_{\\tau}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{w}=\\rho\\,u_{\\tau}^{2}.\n$$\nThis definition arises from dimensional analysis and near-wall scaling of the momentum equation, which identifies $\\rho\\,u_{\\tau}^{2}$ as the characteristic stress scale when velocities are normalized by $u_{\\tau}$ and lengths by the viscous length scale. Solving the above definition for $u_{\\tau}$ gives\n$$\nu_{\\tau}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau_{w}}{\\rho}}.\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the viscous wall unit and the definition of the dimensionless wall-normal coordinate $y^{+}$.

Let the $k$-th layer height be denoted by $H_k$, with $H_1$ prescribed, and let the constant expansion ratio be $r$, defined by $H_{k+1}/H_k=r$. The cumulative thickness of the inflation layer stack of $N$ layers is $H_{\\text{stack}}(N)=\\sum_{k=1}^{N} H_k$, which must be at least a prescribed target thickness $H_{\\text{tot}}$ to envelop the thermal boundary layer.\n\nStarting from the definitions of geometric growth and the finite sum of a geometric progression, and without assuming any pre-derived target formulas, derive the selection criterion for the minimal integer number of layers $N$ needed to ensure $H_{\\text{stack}}(N)\\ge H_{\\text{tot}}$ when a constant per-layer expansion ratio $r$ is used.

            "solution": "The height of the $k$-th layer, $H_k$, is defined by a geometric progression. The first layer height is $H_1$, and each subsequent layer is larger by a constant expansion ratio, $r$.\nThe height of the second layer, $H_2$, is $H_1 \\cdot r$.\nThe height of the third layer, $H_3$, is $H_2 \\cdot r = (H_1 \\cdot r) \\cdot r = H_1 r^2$.\nBy induction, the height of the $k$-th layer is given by:\n$$H_k = H_1 r^{k-1}$$\n\nThe cumulative thickness of the inflation layer stack, $H_{\\text{stack}}(N)$, is the sum of the heights of the first $N$ layers:\n$$H_{\\text{stack}}(N) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} H_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} H_1 r^{k-1}$$\n\nThis is a finite geometric series with first term $a = H_1$, ratio $r$, and $N$ terms. The sum of a finite geometric series is given by the formula $S_N = a \\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1}$. Applying this formula, we get:\n$$H_{\\text{stack}}(N) = H_1 \\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1}$$\nThis expression for $H_{\\text{stack}}(N)$ is derived directly from the definition of geometric growth and the formula for the sum of a geometric progression, as required.\n\nThe problem requires that the total stack thickness be at least the target thickness $H_{\\text{tot}}$. This gives the inequality:\n$$H_{\\text{stack}}(N) \\ge H_{\\text{tot}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $H_{\\text{stack}}(N)$:\n$$H_1 \\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1} \\ge H_{\\text{tot}}$$\n\nWe must now derive the selection criterion for the minimal integer $N$ that satisfies this inequality. We solve for $N$:\n$$\\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1} \\ge \\frac{H_{\\text{tot}}}{H_1}$$\nSince the specified ratio $r = 1.2 > 1$, the term $(r - 1)$ is positive. We can multiply both sides by $(r-1)$ without changing the inequality direction:\n$$r^N - 1 \\ge \\frac{H_{\\text{tot}}}{H_1} (r - 1)$$\n$$r^N \\ge 1 + \\frac{H_{\\text{tot}}}{H_1} (r - 1)$$\nTo solve for the exponent $N$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since $r > 1$, the right-hand side is greater than $1$, so its logarithm is positive. The natural logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, so the inequality direction is preserved:\n$$\\ln(r^N) \\ge \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{H_{\\text{tot}}}{H_1} (r - 1)\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$:\n$$N \\ln(r) \\ge \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{H_{\\text{tot}}}{H_1} (r - 1)\\right)$$\nSince $r = 1.2 > 1$, $\\ln(r)$ is a positive constant.

Using the formula $H_k = H_1 r^{k-1}$:\n$$H_{26} = H_1 r^{26-1} = H_1 r^{25}$$\nSubstitute the numerical values:\n$$H_{26} = (0.01\\,\\text{mm}) \\cdot (1.2)^{25}$$\nCalculate $(1.2)^{25}$:\n$$(1.2)^{25} \\approx 95.39621566$$\nNow, compute $H_{26}$:\n$$H_{26} \\approx (0.01) \\cdot 95.39621566 \\,\\text{mm} \\approx 0.9539621566\\,\\text{mm}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.
