The indices $i, j$ range over $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ corresponding to $(r, \\theta, z)$.\n\nWe begin by computing the partial derivatives of the Cartesian coordinates with respect to the cylindrical coordinates.\nFor $i=1$ (the coordinate $r$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r} = \\cos\\theta, \\quad \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial r} = \\sin\\theta, \\quad \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial r} = 0\n$$\nFor $i=2$ (the coordinate $\\theta$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta} = -r\\sin\\theta, \\quad \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta} = r\\cos\\theta, \\quad \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\theta} = 0\n$$\nFor $i=3$ (the coordinate $z$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial z} = 1\n$$\n\nNow we compute the components of the metric tensor $g_{ij}$:\n$$\ng_{rr} = g_{11} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial r}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial r}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial r}\\right)^2 = (\\cos\\theta)^2 + (\\sin\\theta)^2 + 0^2 = 1\n$$\n$$\ng_{\\theta\\theta} = g_{22} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2 = (-r\\sin\\theta)^2 + (r\\cos\\theta)^2 + 0^2 = r^2\\sin^2\\theta + r^2\\cos^2\\theta = r^2\n$$\n$$\ng_{zz} = g_{33} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial z}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial z}\\right)^2 = 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1\n$$\nThe off-diagonal components are zero due to the orthogonality of the cylindrical coordinate system.
