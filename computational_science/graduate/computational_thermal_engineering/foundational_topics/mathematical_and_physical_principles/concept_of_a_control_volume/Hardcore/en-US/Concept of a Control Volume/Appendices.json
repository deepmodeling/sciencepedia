It is well-posed, providing all necessary information (geometry, velocity field, density field) to calculate a unique value for the net mass flow rate. The language is objective and precise.\n\nA critical check is the physical plausibility of the density field. Density must be positive everywhere within the control volume. The density $\\rho(x,y,z)$ is a linear function of the coordinates. Its minimum value within the specified rectangular domain will occur at one of the corners. To minimize $\\rho = 1.2 + 0.2x - 0.1y + 0.15z$, we must choose the minimum values for coordinates with positive coefficients ($x$ and $z$) and the maximum value for the coordinate with a negative coefficient ($y$).\nThe domain is $x \\in [0, 0.4]$, $y \\in [0, 0.3]$, and $z \\in [0, 0.2]$.\nThe minimum density occurs at $(x, y, z) = (0, 0.3, 0)$.\n$$\n\\rho_{min} = 1.2 + 0.2(0) - 0.1(0.3) + 0.15(0) = 1.2 - 0.03 = 1.17\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nSince $\\rho_{min} > 0$, the density is positive throughout the entire control volume, and the field is physically valid.\nThe problem is complete, consistent, and feasible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe net outward mass flow rate, denoted as $\\dot{m}_{out}$, across the control surface (CS) is given by the integral of the normal component of the mass flux vector, $\\rho\\mathbf{u}$, over the entire control surface. The outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface is $\\mathbf{n}$.\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{out} = \\oint_{CS} \\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dA\n$$\nThe problem statement encourages the use of standard vector calculus. The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's theorem) provides a direct relationship between a surface integral of a vector field over a closed surface and the volume integral of the divergence of that field over the enclosed volume (CV). Applying the Divergence Theorem to the mass flux vector $\\rho\\mathbf{u}$:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{out} = \\oint_{CS} (\\rho\\mathbf{u}) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dA = \\int_{CV} \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\mathbf{u}) \\, dV\n$$\nThis approach avoids the tedious process of integrating over each of the six faces of the control volume. The next step is to compute the divergence of the mass flux, $\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\mathbf{u})$. We use the vector calculus identity for the divergence of a scalar field ($\\rho$) times a vector field ($\\mathbf{u}$):\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\mathbf{u}) = \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\nabla\\rho)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the divergence of the velocity field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$. The components of the velocity field are $u = 1.0 + 0.5x$, $v = 0.4y$, and $w = 0.3 + 0.2z$.\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(1.0+0.5x) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(0.4y) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(0.3+0.2z)\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0.5 + 0.4 + 0.2 = 1.1\n$$\nThis is a constant value. The units are $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we compute the gradient of the density field, $\\nabla\\rho$.\n$$\n\\nabla\\rho = \\left( \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial z} \\right) = \\big( 0.2, -0.1, 0.15 \\big)\n$$\nThis is a constant vector. The units are $\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-4}$.\n\nNow we can assemble the two terms for $\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\mathbf{u})$:\nThe first term is $\\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u})$:\n$$\n\\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = (1.2 + 0.2x - 0.1y + 0.15z)(1.1) = 1.32 + 0.22x - 0.11y + 0.165z\n$$\nThe second term is $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\nabla\\rho)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\nabla\\rho) = (1.0 + 0.5x)(0.2) + (0.4y)(-0.1) + (0.3 + 0.2z)(0.15)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot (\\nabla\\rho) = (0.2 + 0.1x) - 0.04y + (0.045 + 0.03z) = 0.245 + 0.1x - 0.04y + 0.03z\n$$\nSumming these two terms gives the divergence of the mass flux:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\mathbf{u}) = (1.32 + 0.22x - 0.11y + 0.165z) + (0.245 + 0.1x - 0.04y + 0.03z)\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\mathbf{u}) = (1.32 + 0.245) + (0.22 + 0.1)x + (-0.11 - 0.04)y + (0.165 + 0.03)z\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\mathbf{u}) = 1.565 + 0.32x - 0.15y + 0.195z\n$$\nThe units of this expression are $\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nNow, we integrate this expression over the control volume:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{out} = \\int_0^{L_z} \\int_0^{L_y} \\int_0^{L_x} (1.565 + 0.32x - 0.15y + 0.195z) \\, dx \\, dy \\, dz\n$$\nWe can separate the integral:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{out} = \\int_{CV} 1.565\\,dV + \\int_{CV} 0.32x\\,dV - \\int_{CV} 0.15y\\,dV + \\int_{CV} 0.195z\\,dV\n$$\nLet $V = L_x L_y L_z$ be the volume of the CV. The integrals of the coordinate variables over the volume can be related to the centroid of the volume. For a rectangular prism defined by $0 \\le x \\le L_x$, $0 \\le y \\le L_y$, $0 \\le z \\le L_z$, the centroid is at $(\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}, \\bar{z}) = (L_x/2, L_y/2, L_z/2)$. The integrals are:\n$\\int_{CV} x\\,dV = \\bar{x}V = \\frac{L_x}{2}V$, $\\int_{CV} y\\,dV = \\bar{y}V = \\frac{L_y}{2}V$, and $\\int_{CV} z\\,dV = \\bar{z}V = \\frac{L_z}{2}V$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\dot{m}_{out}$:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{out} = 1.565 V + 0.32\\left(\\frac{L_x}{2}V\\right) - 0.15\\left(\\frac{L_y}{2}V\\right) + 0.195\\left(\\frac{L_z}{2}V\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the volume $V$:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{out} = V \\left( 1.565 + 0.16 L_x - 0.075 L_y + 0.0975 L_z \\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for the dimensions: $L_x=0.4\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $L_y=0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $L_z=0.2\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nFirst, calculate the volume $V$:\n$$\nV = L_x L_y L_z = (0.4)(0.3)(0.2) = 0.024\\,\\mathrm{m}^3\n$$\nNext, calculate the term in the parentheses:\n$$\n1.565 + 0.16(0.4) - 0.075(0.3) + 0.0975(0.2)\n$$\n$$\n= 1.565 + 0.064 - 0.0225 + 0.0195\n$$\n$$\n= 1.629 - 0.0225 + 0.0195 = 1.6065 + 0.0195 = 1.626\n$$\nThe units of this term are $\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nFinally, compute the net outward mass flow rate:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{out} = (0.024\\,\\mathrm{m}^3) \\times (1.626\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 0.039024\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{out} \\approx 0.03902\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis positive result indicates a net efflux of mass from the control volume at the given instant.

No subjective claims are made.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Jump Relations\n\nThe derivation of the jump conditions across a discontinuity is most clearly performed in a frame of reference that moves with the discontinuity. Let the discontinuity propagate at a constant speed $s$ in the laboratory frame. In a reference frame moving at speed $s$, the discontinuity is stationary, and the flow is steady. The fluid velocities in this moving frame are given by $u' = u - s$.\n\nThe integral form of a conservation law for a steady flow through a stationary control volume $V$ states that the net flux of a conserved quantity across the control surface $\\partial V$ must be zero (in the absence of source terms).\n$$ \\oint_{\\partial V} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dA = 0 $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{F}$ is the total flux vector of the conserved quantity in the moving frame. We apply this to a thin \"pillbox\" control volume of area $A$ that straddles the stationary discontinuity. As the thickness of the pillbox shrinks to zero, the integral reduces to a balance of fluxes at the right (R) and left (L) faces:\n$$ F_{x,R} A - F_{x,L} A = 0 \\implies F_{x,R} = F_{x,L} $$\nThis gives the general jump condition, often written using the double-bracket notation as $[[F_x]] = 0$, where $F_x$ is the component of the total flux vector normal to the discontinuity. The total flux consists of a convective part (due to mass crossing the boundary) and a non-convective part (like pressure or viscous stresses).\n\n**1. Conservation of Mass**\nFor mass conservation, the conserved quantity per unit mass is $\\psi=1$. The flux is purely convective. In the moving frame, the flux is $F_{mass,x} = \\rho u' = \\rho(u-s)$. The jump condition is:\n$$ [[\\rho(u-s)]] = 0 \\implies \\rho_R(u_R-s) = \\rho_L(u_L-s) $$\n\n**2. Conservation of Momentum**\nFor $x$-momentum, the conserved quantity per unit mass is the lab-frame momentum, $\\psi=u$. The total flux in the $x$-direction is the momentum transported by the fluid plus the pressure force. This flux, across a surface moving with velocity $s$, is given by $F_{momentum,x} = \\rho u (u-s) + p$. The jump condition is:\n$$ [[\\rho u(u-s) + p]] = 0 \\implies \\rho_R u_R(u_R-s) + p_R = \\rho_L u_L(u_L - s) + p_L $$\n\n**Properties of a Contact Discontinuity**\nThe problem specifies that the interface is a contact discontinuity. By definition, a contact discontinuity is a material interface, meaning there is no flow of mass across it. Fluid particles on the interface move *with* the interface. This gives the kinematic condition that the fluid velocity relative to the discontinuity is zero.\n$$ u - s = 0 $$\nThis must hold on both sides of the interface, so:\n$$ u_L - s = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad u_R - s = 0 $$\nThis leads to the primary condition for a contact discontinuity:\n$$ s = u_L = u_R $$\nThe fluid velocity is continuous across the discontinuity and equal to its propagation speed.\n\nWe can now substitute this condition into the mass and momentum jump relations.\n- Mass conservation:\n$$ \\rho_R(u_R-s) = \\rho_L(u_L-s) \\implies \\rho_R(s-s) = \\rho_L(s-s) \\implies 0=0 $$\nThis equation is trivially satisfied, which means that the density $\\rho$ can be discontinuous, i.e., $\\rho_L \\neq \\rho_R$ is permitted.\n- Momentum conservation:\n$$ \\rho_R u_R(u_R-s) + p_R = \\rho_L u_L(u_L - s) + p_L $$\n$$ \\rho_R u_R(0) + p_R = \\rho_L u_L(0) + p_L \\implies p_R = p_L $$\nThis shows that the pressure must be continuous across a contact discontinuity.\n\nThe derived relations for a contact discontinuity are thus: $s = u_L = u_R$ and $p_L = p_R$.\n\n### Application to Given Data\n\nWe are given the following states:\n- Left state: $\\rho_L = 1.40$ kg m$^{-3}$, $u_L = 231.764$ m s$^{-1}$, $p_L = 2.00 \\times 10^{5}$ Pa.\n- Right state: $\\rho_R = 0.700$ kg m$^{-3}$, $u_R = 231.764$ m s$^{-1}$, $p_R = 2.00 \\times 10^{5}$ Pa.\n\nWe verify that this data is consistent with the physics of a contact discontinuity:\n1.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Principle-Based Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires coupling the energy conservation in the fluid with the heat transfer through the pipe wall. We will model the heat transfer process using a thermal resistance network.\n\n**1. Thermal Resistance Network**\n\nFor a differential length of the pipe $\\mathrm{d}x$, the heat transfer rate per unit length, $q'(x)$, from the external environment at $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ to the bulk fluid at $T_b(x)$ must overcome three thermal resistances in series: external convection, wall conduction, and internal convection.\n\n- **Internal Convection Resistance, $R'_i$**:\nBased on Newton's law of cooling at the inner surface (area $A_i = 2\\pi r_i L$), the heat transfer rate per unit length is:\n$$q'(x) = h_i (2\\pi r_i) (T_{w,i}(x) - T_b(x))$$\nThe temperature drop is $\\Delta T = T_{w,i}(x) - T_b(x) = q'(x) \\frac{1}{2\\pi h_i r_i}$. The resistance per unit length is therefore:\n$$R'_i = \\frac{1}{2\\pi h_i r_i}$$\n\n- **Wall Conduction Resistance, $R'_w$**:\nFor steady, one-dimensional radial conduction through a cylindrical shell without heat generation, Fourier's law is given as $q'(x) = -2\\pi r k_w \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}r}$. We separate variables and integrate across the wall thickness, from $r=r_i$ to $r=r_o$, where the temperature changes from $T_{w,i}(x)$ to $T_{w,o}(x)$:\n$$\\int_{r_i}^{r_o} \\frac{q'(x)}{r} \\mathrm{d}r = - \\int_{T_{w,i}(x)}^{T_{w,o}(x)} 2\\pi k_w \\mathrm{d}T$$\n$$q'(x) [\\ln r]_{r_i}^{r_o} = -2\\pi k_w [T]_{T_{w,i}(x)}^{T_{w,o}(x)}$$\n$$q'(x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_o}{r_i}\\right) = 2\\pi k_w (T_{w,i}(x) - T_{w,o}(x))$$\nThe temperature drop is $\\Delta T = T_{w,i}(x) - T_{w,o}(x) = q'(x) \\frac{\\ln(r_o/r_i)}{2\\pi k_w}$. The resistance per unit length is:\n$$R'_w = \\frac{\\ln(r_o/r_i)}{2\\pi k_w}$$\n\n- **External Convection Resistance, $R'_o$**:\nSimilarly, at the outer surface (area $A_o = 2\\pi r_o L$), Newton's law of cooling gives:\n$$q'(x) = h_o (2\\pi r_o) (T_{w,o}(x) - T_{\\mathrm{ext}})$$\nThe temperature drop is $\\Delta T = T_{w,o}(x) - T_{\\mathrm{ext}} = q'(x) \\frac{1}{2\\pi h_o r_o}$. The resistance per unit length is:\n$$R'_o = \\frac{1}{2\\pi h_o r_o}$$\n\nThe total thermal resistance per unit length, $R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of these series resistances:\n$$R'_{\\mathrm{tot}} = R'_i + R'_w + R'_o = \\frac{1}{2\\pi h_i r_i} + \\frac{\\ln(r_o/r_i)}{2\\pi k_w} + \\frac{1}{2\\pi h_o r_o}$$\nThe heat transfer rate per unit length can now be expressed in terms of the overall temperature difference:\n$$q'(x) = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ext}} - T_b(x)}{R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\n\n**2. ODE for Bulk Fluid Temperature**\n\nThe problem provides the energy balance for a differential fluid control volume:\n$$\\dot{m} c_p \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}x} = q'(x)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $q'(x)$ from the resistance network yields the governing ODE for the bulk fluid temperature $T_b(x)$:\n$$\\dot{m} c_p \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ext}} - T_b(x)}{R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it as:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{T_b(x) - T_{\\mathrm{ext}}} = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\dot{m} c_p R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nIntegrating from the pipe inlet ($x=0$, where $T_b(0) = T_{\\mathrm{in}}$) to an arbitrary axial position $x$:\n$$\\int_{T_{\\mathrm{in}}}^{T_b(x)} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b'}{T_b' - T_{\\mathrm{ext}}} = -\\int_0^x \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x'}{\\dot{m} c_p R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\n$$[\\ln(T_b' - T_{\\mathrm{ext}})]_{T_{\\mathrm{in}}}^{T_b(x)} = -\\frac{x}{\\dot{m} c_p R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_b(x) - T_{\\mathrm{ext}}}{T_{\\mathrm{in}} - T_{\\mathrm{ext}}}\\right) = -\\frac{x}{\\dot{m} c_p R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$$\nSolving for $T_b(x)$ gives the axial temperature distribution of the fluid:\n$$T_b(x) = T_{\\mathrm{ext}} + (T_{\\mathrm{in}} - T_{\\mathrm{ext}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\dot{m} c_p R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\right)$$\n\n**3. Expression for Inner Wall Temperature**\n\nThe inner wall temperature $T_{w,i}(x)$ is the quantity of interest. From the definition of the internal convection resistance, we have:\n$$T_{w,i}(x) - T_b(x) = q'(x) R'_i$$\n$$T_{w,i}(x) = T_b(x) + q'(x) R'_i$$\nSubstituting $q'(x) = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ext}} - T_b(x)}{R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$, we get:\n$$T_{w,i}(x) = T_b(x) + \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ext}} - T_b(x)}{R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\\right) R'_i$$\nThis is the final algebraic expression used for computation. We can first calculate $T_b(x)$ at a given $x$ and then use this equation to find the corresponding $T_{w,i}(x)$.\n\n**4. Special Case: Insulated Outer Surface ($h_o = 0$)**\n\nIf $h_o = 0$, the external convection resistance $R'_o = \\frac{1}{2\\pi h_o r_o} \\to \\infty$. Consequently, the total resistance $R'_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\to \\infty$.\nIn this limit, the heat transfer rate per unit length from the environment becomes zero:\n$$q'(x) = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ext}} - T_b(x)}{R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\to 0$$\nSubstituting $q'(x) = 0$ into the fluid energy balance:\n$$\\dot{m} c_p \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0$$\nThis implies that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T_b}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0$, so the bulk fluid temperature remains constant along the pipe:\n$$T_b(x) = T_b(0) = T_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\nFurthermore, since $q'(x)=0$, the temperature drop across the inner convective layer is also zero:\n$$T_{w,i}(x) - T_b(x) = q'(x) R'_i = 0$$\nTherefore, for the perfectly insulated case, the inner wall temperature is constant and equal to the inlet fluid temperature:\n$$T_{w,i}(x) = T_b(x) = T_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\nThe external temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ becomes irrelevant as there is no thermal communication with the environment.\n\n**5. Numerical Implementation**\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\nFor each test case:\n1.  Read the input parameters: $r_i, r_o, L, \\dot{m}, c_p, k_w, h_i, h_o, T_{\\mathrm{in}}, T_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n2.  Check if $h_o = 0$. If so, the result for all three axial positions ($x=0, L/2, L$) is $T_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\n3.  If $h_o > 0$:\n    a. Calculate the thermal resistances per unit length: $R'_i$, $R'_w$, and $R'_o$.\n    b. Sum them to find the total resistance $R'_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n    c. For each required axial position $x \\in \\{0, L/2, L\\}$:\n        i.  Calculate the bulk fluid temperature $T_b(x)$ using its derived exponential profile.\n        ii. Calculate the inner wall temperature $T_{w,i}(x)$ using the algebraic relation derived in section 3.\n4.  Store and format the three computed temperatures for the case, rounded to six decimal places.\n5.  Aggregate the results from all test cases into the final specified format.",
