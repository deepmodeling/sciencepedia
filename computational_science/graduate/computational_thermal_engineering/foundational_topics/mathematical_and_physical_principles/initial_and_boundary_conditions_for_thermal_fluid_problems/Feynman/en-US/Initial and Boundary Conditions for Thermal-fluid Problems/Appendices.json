The first interior cell has its center at $x_{1} = \\Delta x/2$ with temperature $T_{1}$. A ghost cell is placed symmetrically outside the domain, with its center at $x_{G} = -\\Delta x/2$ and an unknown temperature $T_{G}$. The distance between these two cell centers is $x_{1} - x_{G} = (\\Delta x/2) - (-\\Delta x/2) = \\Delta x$.\n\nThe problem specifies two rules for approximating quantities at the boundary face ($x=0$) using the values at the adjacent cell centers, $T_{G}$ and $T_{1}$:\n\n1.  **Face Temperature Reconstruction**: The temperature at the face, $T_{f}$, is determined by linear interpolation between the values at $x_{G}$ and $x_{1}$. Since the face at $x=0$ is the geometric midpoint between $x_{G}$ and $x_{1}$, the interpolated value is the arithmetic mean:\n    $$T_{f} = \\frac{T_{G} + T_{1}}{2}$$\n    The order of accuracy of this interpolation can be assessed with Taylor series expansions of $T(x)$ around $x=0$. Let $T_{0} = T(0,t)$, $T'_{0} = \\partial T/\\partial x|_{x=0}$, $T''_{0} = \\partial^2 T/\\partial x^2|_{x=0}$, etc.\n    $T_{1} = T(\\Delta x/2) = T_{0} + T'_{0}(\\frac{\\Delta x}{2}) + \\frac{T''_{0}}{2!}(\\frac{\\Delta x}{2})^{2} + O(\\Delta x^{3})$\n    $T_{G,\\text{exact}} = T(-\\Delta x/2) = T_{0} - T'_{0}(\\frac{\\Delta x}{2}) + \\frac{T''_{0}}{2!}(\\frac{\\Delta x}{2})^{2} + O(\\Delta x^{3})$\n    The interpolated value is $\\frac{T_{1} + T_{G,\\text{exact}}}{2} = T_{0} + \\frac{T''_{0}}{8}\\Delta x^{2} + O(\\Delta x^{4})$. The error is $T_{f} - T_{0} = O(\\Delta x^{2})$, so this is a second-order accurate approximation of the face temperature.\n\n2.  **Face Gradient Reconstruction**: The temperature gradient at the face, $(\\partial T/\\partial x)_{f}$, is approximated by a centered finite difference using the values at $x_{G}$ and $x_{1}$:\n    $$\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right)_{f} = \\frac{T_{1} - T_{G}}{x_{1} - x_{G}} = \\frac{T_{1} - T_{G}}{\\Delta x}$$\n    Using the same Taylor series, the truncation error of this approximation is:\n    $\\frac{T_{1} - T_{G}}{\\Delta x} - T'_{0} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}(T'_{0}\\Delta x + \\frac{T'''_{0}}{24}\\Delta x^{3} + O(\\Delta x^{5})) - T'_{0} = \\frac{T'''_{0}}{24}\\Delta x^{2} + O(\\Delta x^{4})$.\n    The error is $O(\\Delta x^{2})$, so this is a second-order accurate approximation of the face gradient.\n\nWe now use these second-order accurate reconstructions to enforce the two specified boundary conditions and find the corresponding expression for $T_{G}$.\n\n**1) Dirichlet Boundary Condition**\n\nThe boundary condition specifies a constant temperature at the boundary:\n$$T(0,t) = T_{b}$$\nTo implement this condition in the finite volume scheme, we enforce that the reconstructed temperature at the face equals the specified boundary temperature $T_{b}$.\n$$T_{f} = T_{b}$$\nUsing the formula for the face temperature reconstruction:\n$$\\frac{T_{G} + T_{1}}{2} = T_{b}$$\nSolving for the ghost-cell temperature $T_{G}$:\n$$T_{G} + T_{1} = 2T_{b}$$\n$$T_{G} = 2T_{b} - T_{1}$$\nThis enforcement is second-order accurate because, as shown before, the error in the face temperature approximation is $O(\\Delta x^{2})$. Setting the approximation equal to the exact value $T_b$ means we are implicitly satisfying $T(0,t) + O(\\Delta x^2) = T_b$.\n\n**2) Neumann (Specified Heat Flux) Boundary Condition**\n\nThe boundary condition specifies a constant heat flux at the boundary:\n$$q(0,t) = q_{b}$$\nThe heat flux $q$ is related to the temperature gradient by Fourier's law: $q(x,t) = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$. At the boundary $x=0$, this gives:\n$$q(0,t) = -k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0} = q_{b}$$\nThis implies a condition on the temperature gradient at the boundary:\n$$\\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right|_{x=0} = -\\frac{q_{b}}{k}$$\nTo implement this, we enforce that the reconstructed gradient at the face equals this required value:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right)_{f} = -\\frac{q_{b}}{k}$$\nUsing the formula for the face gradient reconstruction:\n$$\\frac{T_{1} - T_{G}}{\\Delta x} = -\\frac{q_{b}}{k}$$\nSolving for the ghost-cell temperature $T_{G}$:\n$$T_{1} - T_{G} = - \\frac{q_{b} \\Delta x}{k}$$\n$$T_{G} = T_{1} + \\frac{q_{b} \\Delta x}{k}$$\nThis enforcement is second-order accurate because the centered difference approximation for the gradient has a truncation error of $O(\\Delta x^{2})$, as demonstrated earlier.\n\nIn summary, the expressions for the ghost-cell value $T_{G}$ are:\n- For the Dirichlet condition $T(0,t) = T_{b}$: $T_{G} = 2T_{b} - T_{1}$\n- For the Neumann condition $q(0,t) = q_{b}$: $T_{G} = T_{1} + \\frac{q_{b} \\Delta x}{k}$\nThese are presented as a row matrix as requested.",

            "solution": "This problem consists of two tasks. The first is to derive the general boundary condition at a solid-fluid interface with finite thermal contact resistance. The second is to apply this boundary condition to compute the thermal contact resistance from a given set of experimental data.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Interfacial Boundary Condition**\n\nWe begin by applying the principle of local conservation of energy to a control volume straddling the interface. Let the interface be located at the plane $x=0$, with the solid in the region $x0$ and the fluid in the region $x0$. The unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ points from the solid into the fluid, which corresponds to the positive $x$-direction.\n\nConsider a thin, planar control volume (CV) of infinitesimal thickness $2\\epsilon$ and cross-sectional area $A$. The CV extends from $x = -\\epsilon$ in the solid to $x = +\\epsilon$ in the fluid. The general one-dimensional energy balance for this CV is:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{in} - \\dot{E}_{out} + \\dot{E}_{gen} = \\dot{E}_{st}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{E}_{in}$ and $\\dot{E}_{out}$ are the rates of energy transfer by conduction into and out of the CV, $\\dot{E}_{gen}$ is the rate of energy generation within the CV, and $\\dot{E}_{st}$ is the rate of energy storage within the CV.\n\nThe rates of energy transfer by conduction are given by the heat flux at the boundaries of the CV. Let $q_x''(x,t)$ be the heat flux in the $x$-direction.\n$\\dot{E}_{in} = A \\cdot q_x''(x=-\\epsilon, t)$\n$\\dot{E}_{out} = A \\cdot q_x''(x=+\\epsilon, t)$\nThe problem does not specify any heat generation at the interface (e.g., from chemical reactions), so we set $\\dot{E}_{gen} = 0$.\nThe rate of energy storage is related to the change in internal energy of the material within the CV.\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{st} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{+\\epsilon} \\rho(x) c(x) T(x,t) A \\, dx\n$$\nwhere $\\rho(x)$ and $c(x)$ are the local density and specific heat, respectively.\n\nThe energy balance equation becomes:\n$$\nA \\cdot q_x''(-\\epsilon, t) - A \\cdot q_x''(+\\epsilon, t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{+\\epsilon} \\rho c T A \\, dx\n$$\nDividing by the area $A$ yields the energy balance per unit area:\n$$\nq_x''(-\\epsilon, t) - q_x''(+\\epsilon, t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{+\\epsilon} \\rho c T \\, dx\n$$\nTo obtain the condition at the interface itself, we take the limit as the thickness of the CV approaches zero, i.e., $\\epsilon \\to 0$. In this limit, the volume of the CV, and consequently its thermal mass and energy storage capacity, vanishes.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{+\\epsilon} \\rho c T \\, dx = 0\n$$\nThis leads to the first part of the interfacial boundary condition: the continuity of heat flux.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} [q_x''(-\\epsilon, t) - q_x''(+\\epsilon, t)] = 0\n$$\n$$\nq_x''(0^-, t) = q_x''(0^+, t)\n$$\nwhere $q_x''(0^-, t)$ is the heat flux on the solid side of the interface, and $q_x''(0^+, t)$ is the heat flux on the fluid side. We can define a single interfacial heat flux, $q''_{int}(t) = q_x''(0^-, t) = q_x''(0^+, t)$.\n\nOur sign convention is that heat flux is positive in the positive $x$-direction (from solid to fluid). According to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux is related to the temperature gradient by $q_x'' = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$, where $k$ is the thermal conductivity. Applying this to both sides of the interface:\n$$\nq''_{int}(t) = -k_s \\left.\\frac{dT_s}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^-} = -k_f \\left.\\frac{dT_f}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^+}\n$$\nThis equation states that the heat flux is continuous across the interface.\n\nThe second part of the boundary condition accounts for the temperature jump caused by the finite thermal contact resistance, $R_{tc}''$. This resistance is an empirical property of the interface, defined as the ratio of the temperature difference across the interface to the heat flux passing through it.\nLet $T_s(0,t)$ be the temperature of the solid at $x=0^-$ and $T_f(0,t)$ be the temperature of the fluid at $x=0^+$. The temperature jump is $\\Delta T_{int}(t) = T_s(0,t) - T_f(0,t)$. The relationship is:\n$$\nR_{tc}'' = \\frac{\\Delta T_{int}(t)}{q''_{int}(t)} = \\frac{T_s(0,t) - T_f(0,t)}{q''_{int}(t)}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as a condition on the temperature jump:\n$$\nT_s(0,t) - T_f(0,t) = q''_{int}(t) \\cdot R_{tc}''\n$$\nIn summary, the complete interfacial boundary condition is a pair of equations:\n1.  **Heat Flux Continuity**: $q''_{int} = -k_s \\left.\\frac{dT_s}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^-} = -k_f \\left.\\frac{dT_f}{dx}\\right|_{x=0^+}$\n2.  **Temperature Jump**: $T_s(0) - T_f(0) = q''_{int} \\cdot R_{tc}''$\n\n**Task 2: Computation of Thermal Contact Resistance**\n\nWe are asked to compute the thermal contact resistance $R_{tc}''$ using the data provided at time $t=120\\ \\mathrm{s}$, when the system is in a quasi-steady state. The formula derived in Task 1 is:\n$$\nR_{tc}'' = \\frac{T_s(0) - T_f(0)}{q''_{int}}\n$$\nWe are given the interfacial heat flux $q''_{int}$. The problem states its magnitude is $q''=2.80 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{W/m^{2}}$ and it is directed from solid to fluid. In our coordinate system where $x$ increases from solid to fluid, this corresponds to a positive heat flux: $q''_{int} = +2.80 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{W/m^{2}}$.\n\nTo use the formula, we need the temperatures on both sides of the interface, $T_s(0)$ and $T_f(0)$. We are given temperatures at locations near the interface: $T_s(-\\delta_s) = 78.428\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ at $x=-\\delta_s = -2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $T_f(+\\delta_f) = 75.600\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ at $x=+\\delta_f = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n\nWe use the assumption that the temperature profiles are linear in the small regions $[-\\delta_s, 0]$ and $[0, \\delta_f]$. This is justified for quasi-steady, one-dimensional conduction in a region with no heat sources. Under these conditions, the heat flux is constant.\nFrom Fourier's Law, $q_x'' = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$, we get $\\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{q_x''}{k}$. Since $q_x''$ is constant in each region adjacent to the interface, the temperature gradient $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ is constant, confirming the linear temperature profile $T(x) = ax+b$.\n\nFirst, we extrapolate the temperature to the interface on the solid side ($x0$). The temperature at $x=0^-$ is found by integrating the temperature gradient from $x=-\\delta_s$ to $x=0$:\n$$\nT_s(0) - T_s(-\\delta_s) = \\int_{-\\delta_s}^{0} \\frac{dT_s}{dx} dx = \\int_{-\\delta_s}^{0} \\left(-\\frac{q''_{int}}{k_s}\\right) dx = -\\frac{q''_{int}}{k_s} [0 - (-\\delta_s)] = -\\frac{q''_{int} \\delta_s}{k_s}\n$$\nThus, the solid-side interface temperature is:\n$$\nT_s(0) = T_s(-\\delta_s) - \\frac{q''_{int} \\delta_s}{k_s}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$k_s = 200\\ \\mathrm{W/(m \\cdot K)}$, $\\delta_s = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $T_s(-\\delta_s) = 78.428\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n$$\nT_s(0) = 78.428\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - \\frac{(2.80 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{W/m^{2}}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{200\\ \\mathrm{W/(m \\cdot K)}}\n$$\n$$\nT_s(0) = 78.428\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - \\frac{5.6}{200}\\ \\mathrm{K} = 78.428\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 0.028\\ \\mathrm{K} = 78.400\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\n$$\n(Note that a temperature difference in Kelvin is equal to a temperature difference in Celsius, so the units are consistent).\n\nNext, we extrapolate the temperature to the interface on the fluid side ($x0$). The temperature at $x=0^+$ is related to the temperature at $x=\\delta_f$:\n$$\nT_f(\\delta_f) - T_f(0) = \\int_{0}^{\\delta_f} \\frac{dT_f}{dx} dx = \\int_{0}^{\\delta_f} \\left(-\\frac{q''_{int}}{k_f}\\right) dx = -\\frac{q''_{int}}{k_f} (\\delta_f - 0) = -\\frac{q''_{int} \\delta_f}{k_f}\n$$\nThus, the fluid-side interface temperature is:\n$$\nT_f(0) = T_f(\\delta_f) + \\frac{q''_{int} \\delta_f}{k_f}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$k_f = 0.60\\ \\mathrm{W/(m \\cdot K)}$, $\\delta_f = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $T_f(\\delta_f) = 75.600\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n$$\nT_f(0) = 75.600\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + \\frac{(2.80 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{W/m^{2}}) (3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{0.60\\ \\mathrm{W/(m \\cdot K)}}\n$$\n$$\nT_f(0) = 75.600\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + \\frac{0.84}{0.60}\\ \\mathrm{K} = 75.600\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + 1.4\\ \\mathrm{K} = 77.000\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\n$$\nNow we can compute the temperature jump across the interface:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{int} = T_s(0) - T_f(0) = 78.400\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 77.000\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 1.400\\ ^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 1.400\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the thermal contact resistance:\n$$\nR_{tc}'' = \\frac{\\Delta T_{int}}{q''_{int}} = \\frac{1.400\\ \\mathrm{K}}{2.80 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{W/m^{2}}} = \\frac{1.4}{2.8} \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\cdot K/W}\n$$\n$$\nR_{tc}'' = 0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\cdot K/W} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\cdot K/W}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR_{tc}'' = 5.000 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\cdot K/W}\n$$",

Substituting this into the first two terms on the right-hand side yields:\n$$\nT_{b,0} = \\frac{T_{b,0}}{U_{m}\\,A} (U_{m}A) + \\frac{\\delta}{U_{m}\\,A} (U_{m}A) - \\frac{\\delta\\beta}{U_{m}^{2}\\,A} \\int_{A} [u(r)]^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\n$$\nT_{b,0} = T_{b,0} + \\delta - \\frac{\\delta\\beta}{U_{m}^{2}\\,A} \\int_{A} [u(r)]^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nSubtracting $T_{b,0}$ from both sides gives:\n$$\n0 = \\delta - \\frac{\\delta\\beta}{U_{m}^{2}\\,A} \\int_{A} [u(r)]^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nAssuming $\\delta \\neq 0$, we can rearrange the equation to solve for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\delta\\beta}{U_{m}^{2}\\,A} \\int_{A} [u(r)]^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A \\implies 1 = \\frac{\\beta}{U_{m}^{2}\\,A} \\int_{A} [u(r)]^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nNow, we must evaluate the integral of $[u(r)]^2$. The velocity profile is $u(r) = 2U_m(1-(r/R)^2)$.\n$$\n[u(r)]^2 = 4U_{m}^{2} \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^{2}\\right)^{2} = 4U_{m}^{2} \\left(1 - 2\\frac{r^2}{R^2} + \\frac{r^4}{R^4}\\right)\n$$\nThe integral over the cross-sectional area $A$ is performed in polar coordinates, with $\\mathrm{d}A = 2\\pi r\\,\\mathrm{d}r$:\n$$\n\\int_{A} [u(r)]^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}A = \\int_{0}^{R} 4U_{m}^{2} \\left(1 - 2\\frac{r^2}{R^2} + \\frac{r^4}{R^4}\\right) (2\\pi r)\\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\n$$\n= 8\\pi U_{m}^{2} \\int_{0}^{R} \\left(r - \\frac{2r^3}{R^2} + \\frac{r^5}{R^4}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\n$$\n= 8\\pi U_{m}^{2} \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{2r^4}{4R^2} + \\frac{r^6}{6R^4} \\right]_{0}^{R}\n$$\n$$\n= 8\\pi U_{m}^{2} \\left( \\frac{R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{2R^2} + \\frac{R^6}{6R^4} \\right) = 8\\pi U_{m}^{2} \\left( \\frac{R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^2}{2} + \\frac{R^2}{6} \\right) = 8\\pi U_{m}^{2} \\frac{R^2}{6} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^2 U_{m}^{2}\n$$\nSince $A = \\pi R^2$, the integral is $\\frac{4}{3} A U_{m}^{2}$. Substituting this back into the equation for $\\beta$:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{\\beta}{U_{m}^{2}\\,A} \\left(\\frac{4}{3} A U_{m}^{2}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\beta\n$$\nSolving for $\\beta$, we find:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThe second step is to compute the cross-sectional average temperature at the inlet, $T_{A,0}$.\n$$\nT_{A,0} = \\frac{1}{A}\\int_{A} T(r,0)\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $T(r,0)$:\n$$\nT_{A,0} = \\frac{1}{A} \\int_{A} \\left( T_{b,0} + \\delta\\left[1 - \\beta\\,\\frac{u(r)}{U_{m}}\\right] \\right) \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\n$$\nT_{A,0} = \\frac{1}{A} \\int_{A} \\left( T_{b,0} + \\delta - \\frac{\\delta\\beta}{U_{m}} u(r) \\right) \\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nSplit the integral:\n$$\nT_{A,0} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\int_{A} T_{b,0}\\,\\mathrm{d}A + \\int_{A} \\delta\\,\\mathrm{d}A - \\int_{A} \\frac{\\delta\\beta}{U_{m}} u(r)\\,\\mathrm{d}A \\right)\n$$\nPulling the constants out of the integrals:\n$$\nT_{A,0} = \\frac{T_{b,0}}{A} \\int_{A} \\mathrm{d}A + \\frac{\\delta}{A} \\int_{A} \\mathrm{d}A - \\frac{\\delta\\beta}{AU_{m}} \\int_{A} u(r)\\,\\mathrm{d}A\n$$\nWe know that $\\int_{A} \\mathrm{d}A = A$ and $\\int_{A} u(r)\\,\\mathrm{d}A = U_{m}A$. Substituting these gives:\n$$\nT_{A,0} = \\frac{T_{b,0}}{A}(A) + \\frac{\\delta}{A}(A) - \\frac{\\delta\\beta}{AU_{m}}(U_{m}A)\n$$\n$$\nT_{A,0} = T_{b,0} + \\delta - \\delta\\beta = T_{b,0} + \\delta(1-\\beta)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the value of $\\beta = \\frac{3}{4}$ we found earlier:\n$$\nT_{A,0} = T_{b,0} + \\delta\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{4}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_{A,0} = T_{b,0} + \\frac{\\delta}{4}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the cross-sectional average temperature at the inlet in terms of the bulk temperature $T_{b,0}$ and the perturbation amplitude $\\delta$. The units of $T_{A,0}$, $T_{b,0}$, and $\\delta$ are all in kelvin as per the context of thermal problems, although no numerical values are given.",
