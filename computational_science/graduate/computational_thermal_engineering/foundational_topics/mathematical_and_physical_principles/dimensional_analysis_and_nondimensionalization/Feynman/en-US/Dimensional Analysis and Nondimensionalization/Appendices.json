The sphere, with mass $m$, specific heat capacity $c$, and surface area $A$, is initially at a uniform temperature $T_0$. At time $t=0$, it is placed in a large, well-ventilated room where the air is maintained at a constant ambient temperature $T_{env}$, with $T_0 > T_{env}$. The cooling of the sphere is governed by Newton's law of cooling, which states that the rate of heat loss is proportional to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The task is to perform a \"unit-consistency audit\" and identify hidden assumptions. This is a well-defined analytical task with a unique set of correct conclusions based on the provided equations and definitions.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical and physical terms.

There are no contradictions.\n-   **Other Flaws:** The problem does not exhibit any other flaws. It is a standard, valid problem in an introductory computational science or numerical analysis context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Audit\n\nThe principle of dimensional homogeneity states that for an equation to be physically meaningful, all terms being added or subtracted must have the same physical dimensions, and the dimensions of the left-hand side must equal the dimensions of the right-hand side.\n\n**1. Dimensional Analysis of the Governing PDE**\n\nWe begin with the continuous governing law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\kappa\\, \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nLet's analyze the units of each side.\n-   **Left-Hand Side (LHS):** The term $\\partial u/\\partial t$ is a rate of change of $u$ with respect to time. Its units are:\n    $$\n    \\left[\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right] = \\frac{[u]}{[t]} = \\frac{\\mathcal{U}}{\\mathcal{T}} = \\mathcal{U}\\mathcal{T}^{-1}\n    $$\n-   **Right-Hand Side (RHS):** The term $\\kappa\\, \\partial^{2} u/\\partial x^{2}$ involves the second spatial derivative of $u$. Its units are:\n    $$\n    \\left[\\kappa\\, \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right] = [\\kappa] \\left[\\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right] = [\\kappa] \\frac{[u]}{[x]^2} = [\\kappa] \\frac{\\mathcal{U}}{\\mathcal{L}^2}\n    $$\nFor the PDE to be dimensionally homogeneous, we must have $[LHS] = [RHS]$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{U}\\mathcal{T}^{-1} = [\\kappa] \\frac{\\mathcal{U}}{\\mathcal{L}^2}\n$$\nSolving for the dimensions of the diffusivity constant $\\kappa$:\n$$\n[\\kappa] = \\frac{\\mathcal{U}\\mathcal{T}^{-1}}{\\mathcal{U}\\mathcal{L}^{-2}} = \\mathcal{L}^{2}\\mathcal{T}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is a fundamental result: the units of diffusivity are length-squared per time.\n\n**2. Dimensional Analysis of the Finite-Difference Scheme**\n\nNow we audit the discrete update equation:\n$$\nu^{n+1}_i \\;=\\; u^n_i \\;+\\; \\underbrace{\\left(\\kappa\\,\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}\\right)\\,\\Big(u^n_{i+1} - 2\\,u^n_i + u^n_{i-1}\\Big)}_{\\text{Increment Term}}\n$$\nThis is an additive equation. For it to be consistent, all three terms ($u^{n+1}_i$, $u^n_i$, and the increment term) must have the same units.\n\n-   **LHS Term:** The term $u^{n+1}_i$ is a value of the field $u$, so its units are $[u^{n+1}_i] = [u] = \\mathcal{U}$.\n-   **First RHS Term:** The term $u^n_i$ is also a value of the field $u$, so its units are $[u^n_i] = [u] = \\mathcal{U}$. This is consistent with the LHS.\n-   **Second RHS Term (Increment Term):** We must verify that this entire term also has units of $\\mathcal{U}$. Let's break it down.\n    -   **Parenthetical Difference:** The term $(u^n_{i+1} - 2\\,u^n_i + u^n_{i-1})$ is a linear combination of values of $u$. The numerical factor $2$ is dimensionless. Therefore, the units of this entire expression are simply the units of $u$:\n        $$\n        \\left[u^n_{i+1} - 2\\,u^n_i + u^n_{i-1}\\right] = [u] = \\mathcal{U}\n        $$\n    -   **Prefactor:** The prefactor is the group $\\kappa\\,\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}$. Let's determine its units using the result for $[\\kappa]$ and the definitions of the step sizes.\n        -   $[\\kappa] = \\mathcal{L}^{2}\\mathcal{T}^{-1}$\n        -   $\\Delta t$ is a time step, so $[\\Delta t] = [t] = \\mathcal{T}$.\n        -   $\\Delta x$ is a spatial step, so $[\\Delta x] = [x] = \\mathcal{L}$. Thus, $[\\Delta x^2] = \\mathcal{L}^2$.\n        -   The units of the prefactor are:\n            $$\n            \\left[\\kappa\\,\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}\\right] = [\\kappa]\\,\\frac{[\\Delta t]}{[\\Delta x^2]} = (\\mathcal{L}^{2}\\mathcal{T}^{-1}) \\frac{\\mathcal{T}}{\\mathcal{L}^2} = \\mathcal{L}^{2-2}\\mathcal{T}^{-1+1} = \\mathcal{L}^{0}\\mathcal{T}^{0} = 1\n            $$\n            The prefactor $\\kappa\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x^2$ is a dimensionless number. This group is often called the diffusion number or discrete Courant number.\n    -   **Total Increment Term:** The units of the increment term are the product of the units of its two parts:\n        $$\n        \\left[\\left(\\kappa\\,\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}\\right)\\,\\Big(u^n_{i+1} - 2\\,u^n_i + u^n_{i-1}\\Big)\\right] = 1 \\times \\mathcal{U} = \\mathcal{U}\n        $$\nSince the increment term has units $\\mathcal{U}$, it can be validly added to $u^n_i$ (units $\\mathcal{U}$) to yield $u^{n+1}_i$ (units $\\mathcal{U}$). The scheme is dimensionally homogeneous.\n\n**3. Hidden Assumptions**\n\n-   **Uniform Grid:** The finite-difference approximation for the second derivative, $\\frac{u^n_{i+1} - 2u^n_i + u^n_{i-1}}{\\Delta x^2}$, is valid for a grid with uniform spacing $\\Delta x$. The use of a single $\\Delta x^2$ term as a factor for the entire spatial domain implies this assumption.\n-   **Dimensionless Indices:** The indices $i$ and $n$ are dimensionless integers that serve as counters or labels for grid points and time levels, respectively.\n-   **Nondimensionalization:** If a user implements this scheme in code and sets a dimensional parameter like $\\kappa$ or $\\Delta x$ to a value like $1.0$, they are implicitly working in a nondimensional system of units. For example, to make the PDE dimensionless, one defines dimensionless variables $\\hat x = x/L_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $\\hat t = t/T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and $\\hat u = u/U_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, where $L_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, and $U_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ are characteristic reference scales. A judicious choice of $T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = L_{\\mathrm{ref}}^2 / \\kappa$ (where $\\kappa$ is the physical diffusivity) transforms the PDE into $\\partial \\hat u/\\partial \\hat t = \\partial^2 \\hat u/\\partial \\hat x^2$, where the effective dimensionless diffusivity is $1$. This practice is an application of formal nondimensionalization.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The scheme is dimensionally homogeneous provided $[\\kappa]=\\mathcal{L}^{2}\\,\\mathcal{T}^{-1}$, $[\\Delta x]=\\mathcal{L}$, $[\\Delta t]=\\mathcal{T}$, and $[u]=\\mathcal{U}$. The combination $\\kappa\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x^{2}$ is dimensionless, and the parenthetical difference has units $\\mathcal{U}$, so the increment has units $\\mathcal{U}$ and can be added to $u^n_i$. Hidden assumptions include: uniform grid spacing (constant $\\Delta x$ so that a single $\\Delta x^{2}$ factors the discrete Laplacian), consistent units for $u$ at all nodes and times, indices $i$ and $n$ are dimensionless labels, and any coding choice like setting $\\kappa=1$ or $\\Delta x=1$ implies a deliberate nondimensionalization with reference scales, e.g., $x=L_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\,\\hat x$, $t=(L_{\\mathrm{ref}}^{2}/\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\,\\hat t$, and $u=U_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\,\\hat u$.**\n-   This option correctly identifies that $[\\kappa]=\\mathcal{L}^{2}\\,\\mathcal{T}^{-1}$.\n-   It correctly states that $\\kappa\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x^{2}$ is dimensionless.\n-   It correctly identifies the units of the difference term as $\\mathcal{U}$ and the increment as $\\mathcal{U}$.\n-   It correctly identifies the key assumptions: uniform grid, consistent units, dimensionless indices, and the implications of setting parameters to unity as a form of nondimensionalization. The example reference scales are standard.\n-   This option provides a complete and accurate audit.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The factor $\\kappa\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x^{2}$ has units $\\mathcal{T}^{-1}$, so the term $\\left(\\kappa\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x^{2}\\right)\\left(u^n_{i+1} - 2\\,u^n_i + u^n_{i-1}\\right)$ has units $\\mathcal{U}\\,\\mathcal{T}^{-1}$. Therefore, $u$ must be scaled to have units $\\mathcal{U}\\,\\mathcal{T}$ for the sum to be meaningful. No assumptions about grid uniformity are required.**\n-   The claim that $[\\kappa\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x^{2}] = \\mathcal{T}^{-1}$ is incorrect. As derived, this group is dimensionless.\n-   The conclusion that the increment has units $\\mathcal{U}\\,\\mathcal{T}^{-1}$ is therefore also incorrect.\n-   The suggestion that $u$ must have units of $\\mathcal{U}\\,\\mathcal{T}$ is absurd and violates the very premise of the problem where $[u]=\\mathcal{U}$.\n-   The claim that no grid uniformity is required is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Because $u^n_{i+1} - 2\\,u^n_i + u^n_{i-1}$ is a discrete second derivative, it already has units $\\mathcal{U}\\,\\mathcal{L}^{-2}$. Thus, the denominator $\\Delta x^{2}$ in the update is redundant and should be removed to maintain consistency, giving $u^{n+1}_i = u^n_i + \\kappa\\,\\Delta t\\,\\left(u^n_{i+1} - 2\\,u^n_i + u^n_{i-1}\\right)$.**\n-   This option makes a fundamental error. The expression $u^n_{i+1} - 2\\,u^n_i + u^n_{i-1}$ is a finite difference, but its units are simply $[u]=\\mathcal{U}$. It only becomes an approximation of the second derivative *after* division by $\\Delta x^2$. The premise that it has units $\\mathcal{U}\\,\\mathcal{L}^{-2}$ is false.\n-   Removing $\\Delta x^2$ would make the equation dimensionally inconsistent, as the added term would have units $[\\kappa][\\Delta t][u] = (\\mathcal{L}^2\\mathcal{T}^{-1})(\\mathcal{T})(\\mathcal{U}) = \\mathcal{L}^2\\mathcal{U}$, which cannot be added to $u_i^n$ (units $\\mathcal{U}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The update is dimensionally homogeneous only if $u$ is nondimensional (that is, $[u]=1$). If $u$ carries physical units, the sum $u^n_i + \\cdots$ is not defined, so $u$ must be scaled to be unitless before applying the scheme.**\n-   The word \"only\" makes this statement false. Our analysis proved that the scheme is perfectly dimensionally homogeneous even when $u$ carries physical units $\\mathcal{U}$. The claim that the sum is not defined for physical units is demonstrably false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Since indices $i$ and $n$ are integers, both $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta t$ must be dimensionless increments; therefore, to balance units, $\\kappa$ must carry the same units as $u$ so that the added term matches $u^n_i$. This removes any need for nondimensionalization or reference scales.**\n-   The premise is flawed. From $x_i = i\\,\\Delta x$, if $[x_i]=\\mathcal{L}$ and $[i]=1$, then by dimensional analysis, $[\\Delta x]$ must be $\\mathcal{L}$. Similarly, $[\\Delta t]$ must be $\\mathcal{T}$. The claim that they are dimensionless is incorrect.\n-   The subsequent reasoning is built on this false premise and is therefore incorrect. For instance, requiring $[\\kappa]=[u]$ would lead to contradictions with the original PDE.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Formulation of the Coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)\n\nThe system consists of a hot reservoir with thermal capacitance $C_h$ and temperature $T_h(t)$, and a cold reservoir with thermal capacitance $C_c$ and temperature $T_c(t)$. Heat is exchanged between them through a thermal conductance $G$. The fundamental principles governing the system are energy conservation for each reservoir and Newton's law of cooling for the heat transfer between them.\n\nAccording to Newton's law of cooling, the instantaneous rate of heat transfer, $\\dot{Q}$, from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir is proportional to the temperature difference:\n$$\n\\dot{Q}(t) = G \\cdot [T_h(t) - T_c(t)]\n$$\nThis heat transfer rate has units of watts ($W$) or joules per second ($J/s$).\n\nThe principle of energy conservation applied to each reservoir states that the rate of change of internal energy is equal to the net rate of heat transfer into the reservoir. Since the reservoirs are assumed to be well-mixed (lumped capacitance model), their internal energies $U_h$ and $U_c$ are given by $U_h(t) = C_h T_h(t)$ and $U_c(t) = C_c T_c(t)$, respectively.\n\nFor the hot reservoir, heat is flowing out, so its energy decreases.

The relevant physical parameters that determine this response are: the temperature rise itself, $(T_c(t) - T_{c,0})$; the time, $t$; the thermal capacitances, $C_h$ and $C_c$; the thermal conductance, $G$; and the initial driving temperature difference, $(T_{h,0} - T_{c,0})$.\n\nLet's list these $n=6$ physical quantities and their fundamental dimensions in a system of energy (E), time (t), and temperature ($\\Theta$):\n- $T_c(t) - T_{c,0}$: $[\\Theta]$\n- $t$: $[\\mathrm{t}]$\n- $C_h$: $[\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}]$\n- $C_c$: $[\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}]$\n- $G$: $[\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{t}^{-1} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}]$\n- $T_{h,0} - T_{c,0}$: $[\\Theta]$\n\nThe number of fundamental dimensions is $k=3$. According to the Buckingham Pi theorem, the number of independent dimensionless groups (Pi groups) is $n - k = 6 - 3 = 3$.\n\nTo find these groups, we select $k=3$ repeating variables that, combined, contain all fundamental dimensions and are dimensionally independent. A suitable set of repeating variables is $G$, $C_c$, and the initial temperature difference $\\Delta T_0 = T_{h,0} - T_{c,0}$.\n- $[G] = \\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{t}^{-1} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}$\n- $[C_c] = \\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}$\n- $[\\Delta T_0] = \\Theta$\n\nThese are dimensionally independent as no combination $[G]^a [C_c]^b [\\Delta T_0]^c$ can form a dimensionless group unless $a=b=c=0$.\n\nNow we form the Pi groups by combining the repeating variables with each of the remaining non-repeating variables: $(T_c(t) - T_{c,0})$, $t$, and $C_h$.\n\n**$\\Pi_1$ (Dimensionless Temperature):** We combine with $(T_c(t) - T_{c,0})$.\n$$\n\\Pi_1 = (T_c(t) - T_{c,0}) \\cdot G^a C_c^b (\\Delta T_0)^c\n$$\nFor $\\Pi_1$ to be dimensionless, the dimensions must cancel:\n$[\\Theta] \\cdot [\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{t}^{-1} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}]^a \\cdot [\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}]^b \\cdot [\\Theta]^c = \\mathrm{E}^0 \\mathrm{t}^0 \\Theta^0$.\n- For E: $a+b=0$\n- For t: $-a=0 \\implies a=0$\n- For $\\Theta$: $1-a-b+c=0$\nSolving yields $a=0$, $b=0$, and $c=-1$. Thus:\n$$\n\\Pi_1 = \\frac{T_c(t) - T_{c,0}}{T_{h,0} - T_{c,0}} \\equiv \\theta_c\n$$\n\n**$\\Pi_2$ (Dimensionless Time):** We combine with $t$.\n$$\n\\Pi_2 = t \\cdot G^a C_c^b (\\Delta T_0)^c\n$$\n$[\\mathrm{t}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{t}^{-1} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}]^a \\cdot [\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}]^b \\cdot [\\Theta]^c = \\mathrm{E}^0 \\mathrm{t}^0 \\Theta^0$.\n- For E: $a+b=0$\n- For t: $1-a=0 \\implies a=1$\n- For $\\Theta$: $-a-b+c=0$\nSolving yields $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=0$. Thus:\n$$\n\\Pi_2 = \\frac{Gt}{C_c} \\equiv \\tau\n$$\n\n**$\\Pi_3$ (Dimensionless Capacitance Ratio):** We combine with $C_h$.\n$$\n\\Pi_3 = C_h \\cdot G^a C_c^b (\\Delta T_0)^c\n$$\n$[\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\mathrm{t}^{-1} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}]^a \\cdot [\\mathrm{E} \\cdot \\Theta^{-1}]^b \\cdot [\\Theta]^c = \\mathrm{E}^0 \\mathrm{t}^0 \\Theta^0$.\n- For E: $1+a+b=0$\n- For t: $-a=0 \\implies a=0$\n- For $\\Theta$: $-1-a-b+c=0$\nSolving yields $a=0$, $b=-1$, and $c=0$. Thus:\n$$\n\\Pi_3 = \\frac{C_h}{C_c} \\equiv C_R\n$$\n\nThe minimal set of dimensionless groups is therefore $\\theta_c$, $\\tau$, and $C_R$. The functional relationship is $\\Pi_1 = f(\\Pi_2, \\Pi_3)$, or $\\theta_c = f(\\tau, C_R)$, confirming that the dimensionless solution depends only on these groups.\n\n### 3. Nondimensionalization of the ODE System\n\nWe now rewrite the governing ODEs in terms of the dimensionless groups identified above. Let's define the dimensionless temperatures and time:\n- $\\theta_c(\\tau) = \\frac{T_c(t) - T_{c,0}}{T_{h,0} - T_{c,0}}$\n- $\\theta_h(\\tau) = \\frac{T_h(t) - T_{c,0}}{T_{h,0} - T_{c,0}}$\n- $\\tau = \\frac{Gt}{C_c}$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can express the dimensional temperatures as:\n- $T_c(t) = T_{c,0} + \\theta_c(\\tau) (T_{h,0} - T_{c,0})$\n- $T_h(t) = T_{c,0} + \\theta_h(\\tau) (T_{h,0} - T_{c,0})$\n\nThe time derivative must be transformed using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} \\frac{d}{d\\tau} = \\frac{G}{C_c} \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\n$$\n\nSubstitute these into the original ODEs.\n**Hot-side ODE:** $C_h \\frac{dT_h}{dt} = -G(T_h - T_c)$\n$$\nC_h \\left( \\frac{G}{C_c} \\frac{d}{d\\tau} [T_{c,0} + \\theta_h (T_{h,0} - T_{c,0})] \\right) = -G \\left( [T_{c,0} + \\theta_h (T_{h,0}-T_{c,0})] - [T_{c,0} + \\theta_c (T_{h,0}-T_{c,0})] \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{C_h}{C_c} G (T_{h,0}-T_{c,0}) \\frac{d\\theta_h}{d\\tau} = -G (T_{h,0}-T_{c,0}) (\\theta_h - \\theta_c)\n$$\nDividing by $G(T_{h,0}-T_{c,0})$ and substituting $C_R = C_h/C_c$ yields the first dimensionless ODE:\n$$\nC_R \\frac{d\\theta_h}{d\\tau} = -(\\theta_h - \\theta_c)\n$$\n\n**Cold-side ODE:** $C_c \\frac{dT_c}{dt} = G(T_h - T_c)$\n$$\nC_c \\left( \\frac{G}{C_c} \\frac{d}{d\\tau} [T_{c,0} + \\theta_c (T_{h,0} - T_{c,0})] \\right) = G \\left( [T_{c,0} + \\theta_h (T_{h,0}-T_{c,0})] - [T_{c,0} + \\theta_c (T_{h,0}-T_{c,0})] \\right)\n$$\n$$\nG (T_{h,0}-T_{c,0}) \\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau} = G (T_{h,0}-T_{c,0}) (\\theta_h - \\theta_c)\n$$\nDividing by $G(T_{h,0}-T_{c,0})$ yields the second dimensionless ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau} = \\theta_h - \\theta_c\n$$\n\nThe dimensionless initial conditions at $\\tau=0$ (which corresponds to $t=0$) are:\n- $\\theta_h(0) = \\frac{T_{h,0} - T_{c,0}}{T_{h,0} - T_{c,0}} = 1$\n- $\\theta_c(0) = \\frac{T_{c,0} - T_{c,0}}{T_{h,0} - T_{c,0}} = 0$\n\nThe nondimensionalized system depends only on the single parameter $C_R$, as predicted by the dimensional analysis.\n\n### 4. Derivation of the Closed-Form Expression\n\nWe have a system of two linear ODEs. To solve for $\\theta_c(\\tau)$, we can decouple the equations. From the second dimensionless ODE, we express $\\theta_h$ in terms of $\\theta_c$:\n$$\n\\theta_h = \\theta_c + \\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau}\n$$\nDifferentiating this with respect to $\\tau$ gives $\\frac{d\\theta_h}{d\\tau} = \\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau} + \\frac{d^2\\theta_c}{d\\tau^2}$.\nSubstitute these into the first dimensionless ODE, $C_R \\frac{d\\theta_h}{d\\tau} = -(\\theta_h - \\theta_c)$:\n$$\nC_R \\left( \\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau} + \\frac{d^2\\theta_c}{d\\tau^2} \\right) = -\\left( \\left(\\theta_c + \\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau}\\right) - \\theta_c \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_R \\frac{d^2\\theta_c}{d\\tau^2} + C_R \\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau} = -\\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau}\n$$\nThis simplifies to a second-order, linear, homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients for $\\theta_c(\\tau)$:\n$$\nC_R \\frac{d^2\\theta_c}{d\\tau^2} + (C_R + 1) \\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau} = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $C_R r^2 + (C_R+1)r = 0$, which factors as $r(C_R r + C_R+1) = 0$. The roots are:\n$$\nr_1 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r_2 = -\\frac{C_R+1}{C_R} = -\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{C_R}\\right)\n$$\nThe general solution for $\\theta_c(\\tau)$ is:\n$$\n\\theta_c(\\tau) = A e^{r_1 \\tau} + B e^{r_2 \\tau} = A + B e^{-(1 + 1/C_R)\\tau}\n$$\nThe constants $A$ and $B$ are determined from the initial conditions. We have $\\theta_c(0)=0$. We need a second condition for the derivative $\\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau}$ at $\\tau=0$. From the dimensionless system, $\\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau} = \\theta_h - \\theta_c$. At $\\tau=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau}(0) = \\theta_h(0) - \\theta_c(0) = 1 - 0 = 1\n$$\nApplying the first condition to the general solution:\n$$\n\\theta_c(0) = A + B = 0 \\implies A = -B\n$$\nDifferentiating the general solution with respect to $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau} = -B \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{C_R}\\right) e^{-(1 + 1/C_R)\\tau}\n$$\nApplying the second condition at $\\tau=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta_c}{d\\tau}(0) = -B \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{C_R}\\right) = 1 \\implies B = -\\frac{1}{1 + 1/C_R} = -\\frac{C_R}{C_R+1}\n$$\nThen, $A = -B = \\frac{C_R}{C_R+1}$.\nSubstituting $A$ and $B$ back into the general solution for $\\theta_c(\\tau)$ gives the final expression:\n$$\n\\theta_c(\\tau) = \\frac{C_R}{C_R+1} - \\frac{C_R}{C_R+1} e^{-(1 + 1/C_R)\\tau}\n$$\nFactoring this expression yields the desired closed-form solution:\n$$\n\\theta_c(t) = \\frac{C_R}{C_R+1} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left[ -\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{C_R}\\right) \\tau \\right] \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\theta_c(t)$ is the normalized temperature, $C_R = C_h/C_c$ is the capacitance ratio, and $\\tau = Gt/C_c$ is the dimensionless time. This expression is exclusively in terms of the derived dimensionless groups.",
