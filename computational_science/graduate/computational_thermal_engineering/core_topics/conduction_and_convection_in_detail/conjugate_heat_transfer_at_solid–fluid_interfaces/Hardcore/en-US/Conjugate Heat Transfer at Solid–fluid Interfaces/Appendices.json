A rigorous derivation from the specified first principles is possible. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation\nThe derivation begins with the application of the principle of conservation of energy to a differential control volume within the solid film. For steady-state ($ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0 $), one-dimensional ($ y $-direction only) heat transfer with no internal heat generation ($ \\dot{q} = 0 $) and constant thermal conductivity ($ k_s $), the general heat diffusion equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(k_s \\frac{dT}{dy}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $k_s$ is a constant, it can be divided out, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2T}{dy^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation for the temperature profile $T(y)$ within the film. Integrating twice with respect to $y$ gives the general solution:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dy} = C_1\n$$\n$$\nT(y) = C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  At the interface with the substrate ($y=0$), the temperature is fixed:\n    $$ T(0) = T_0 $$\n2.  At the outer surface ($y=L$), the heat conducted to the surface from within the solid must equal the heat convected from the surface into the fluid. This is an energy balance at the interface, combining Fourier’s law of heat conduction and Newton’s law of cooling:\n    $$ q''_{\\text{cond}} = q''_{\\text{conv}} $$\n    $$ -k_s \\frac{dT}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=L} = h\\bigl(T(L) - T_{\\infty}\\bigr) $$\n\nWe apply the first boundary condition to the general solution for $T(y)$:\n$$\nT(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = T_0 \\implies C_2 = T_0\n$$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the temperature profile gives:\n$$\nT(y) = C_1 y + T_0\n$$\nNext, we apply the second boundary condition. We need the terms $T(L)$ and $\\frac{dT}{dy}$:\n$$\nT(L) = C_1 L + T_0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dy} = C_1\n$$\nSubstituting these into the energy balance at $y=L$:\n$$\n-k_s (C_1) = h\\bigl((C_1 L + T_0) - T_{\\infty}\\bigr)\n$$\nWe now solve for the constant $C_1$:\n$$\n-k_s C_1 = h C_1 L + h(T_0 - T_{\\infty})\n$$\n$$\n-h(T_0 - T_{\\infty}) = k_s C_1 + h L C_1\n$$\n$$\n-h(T_0 - T_{\\infty}) = C_1(k_s + hL)\n$$\n$$\nC_1 = -\\frac{h(T_0 - T_{\\infty})}{k_s + hL}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the net steady heat flux, $q''$, leaving the substrate. This is the heat flux at $y=0$. According to Fourier's law:\n$$\nq'' = -k_s \\frac{dT}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=0}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{dT}{dy} = C_1$ is constant throughout the film (a consequence of steady state with no generation), we have:\n$$\nq'' = -k_s C_1\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_1$:\n$$\nq'' = -k_s \\left( -\\frac{h(T_0 - T_{\\infty})}{k_s + hL} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nq'' = \\frac{k_s h (T_0 - T_{\\infty})}{k_s + hL}\n$$\nThe problem defines the effective heat transfer coefficient, $h_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, through the relation:\n$$\nq'' = h_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_0 - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nBy equating our derived expression for $q''$ with its definition involving $h_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we get:\n$$\nh_{\\mathrm{eff}}(T_0 - T_{\\infty}) = \\frac{k_s h (T_0 - T_{\\infty})}{k_s + hL}\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial case where $T_0 \\neq T_{\\infty}$, we can divide both sides by the temperature difference $(T_0 - T_{\\infty})$ to isolate $h_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nh_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{k_s h}{k_s + hL}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the effective heat transfer coefficient as a function of the given parameters. The expression can also be written as $h_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{h} + \\frac{L}{k_s}\\right)^{-1}$, which clearly shows that the total thermal resistance is the sum of the convective and conductive resistances in series.",

It is a standard problem in one-dimensional steady-state heat conduction.\n\nThe first step is to derive the governing differential equation for the temperature distribution $T(x)$ within the solid slab.

For steady-state conditions, the rate of energy entering the control volume plus the rate of energy generated within it must equal the rate of energy leaving it.\nLet $q_x''(x)$ be the heat flux in the positive $x$-direction at position $x$. The energy balance is:\n$$A q_x''(x) + \\dot{q}''' (A \\Delta x) = A q_x''(x+\\Delta x)$$\nwhere $\\dot{q}'''$ is the uniform volumetric heat generation rate.

The convective flux, governed by Newton's law of cooling, is $h[T(0) - T_{\\infty}]$, where $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient and $T_{\\infty}$ is the free-stream fluid temperature. Thus, the boundary condition at $x=0$ is:\n$$-k_s \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = h[T(0) - T_{\\infty}]$$\nThis is a boundary condition of the third kind (Robin condition).\n\nAt the face $x=L$, the slab is perfectly insulated.

Since we are modeling the substrate with thickness $t_s$ and thermal conductivity $k_s$, the cross-sectional area for heat flow per unit width is $t_s$.\n$$ q'_x = -k_s t_s \\frac{dT_w(x)}{dx} $$\nSubstituting this into the energy balance equation:\n$$ q''_{\\text{in}} - q''_{\\text{fluid}}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -k_s t_s \\frac{dT_w(x)}{dx} \\right) = -k_s t_s \\frac{d^2T_w(x)}{dx^2} $$\nSolving for the actual heat flux to the fluid, $q''_{\\text{fluid}}(x)$:\n$$ q''_{\\text{fluid}}(x) = q''_{\\text{in}} + k_s t_s \\frac{d^2T_w(x)}{dx^2} $$\nThis equation shows that the local heat flux to the fluid is the sum of the imposed surface flux and a term representing the net rate of heat gained or lost by the element due to axial conduction.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $q''_{\\text{fluid}}(x)$ into our equation for the correction factor $C(x)$:\n$$ C(x) = \\frac{q''_{\\text{in}}}{q''_{\\text{in}} + k_s t_s \\frac{d^2T_w(x)}{dx^2}} $$\nThe problem asks for the bias $B$ at the mid-length position $x = L/2$, which is defined as $B = C(L/2) - 1$.\n$$ B = \\frac{q''_{\\text{in}}}{q''_{\\text{in}} + k_s t_s \\left. \\frac{d^2T_w}{dx^2} \\right|_{x=L/2}} - 1 $$\nWe must now calculate the second derivative of the given wall temperature distribution $T_w(x) = 320\\,\\mathrm{K} + 1.2\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\sin(\\pi x/L)$.\nThe first derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dT_w}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ 320 + 1.2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right] = 1.2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{L} = \\frac{1.2 \\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2T_w}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{1.2 \\pi}{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1.2 \\pi}{L} \\left[ -\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{L} \\right] = - \\frac{1.2 \\pi^2}{L^2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nNow, we evaluate this second derivative at $x = L/2$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{d^2T_w}{dx^2} \\right|_{x=L/2} = - \\frac{1.2 \\pi^2}{L^2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi (L/2)}{L}\\right) = - \\frac{1.2 \\pi^2}{L^2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\nSince $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$, we have:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{d^2T_w}{dx^2} \\right|_{x=L/2} = - \\frac{1.2 \\pi^2}{L^2} $$\nWe now substitute the numerical values.\n$L = 0.060\\,\\mathrm{m}$, so $L^2 = (0.060)^2\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 = 0.0036\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n$$ \\left. \\frac{d^2T_w}{dx^2} \\right|_{x=L/2} = - \\frac{1.2 \\pi^2}{0.0036} \\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\nThe axial conduction term in the denominator is $k_s t_s \\left. \\frac{d^2T_w}{dx^2} \\right|_{x=L/2}$.\nUsing $k_s = 205\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $t_s = 0.0015\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$ k_s t_s = (205\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) (0.0015\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.3075\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_s t_s \\left. \\frac{d^2T_w}{dx^2} \\right|_{x=L/2} = (0.3075\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\left( - \\frac{1.2 \\pi^2}{0.0036\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} \\right) \\approx -1011.633\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\nThe imposed heat flux is $q''_{\\text{in}} = 8000\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Now we can calculate the bias $B$:\n$$ B = \\frac{8000\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}}{8000\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2} - 1011.633\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}} - 1 $$\n$$ B = \\frac{8000}{6988.367} - 1 $$\n$$ B \\approx 1.144754 - 1 = 0.144754 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the bias $B$ is $0.1448$. This positive bias indicates that at the center of the test section, where the wall temperature is at a maximum (concave down, $d^2T_w/dx^2<0$), axial conduction carries heat away from this point, so the actual heat flux to the fluid $q''_{\\text{fluid}}$ is less than the applied flux $q''_{\\text{in}}$. This results in an apparent Nusselt number that is artificially inflated by approximately $14.48\\%$.",
