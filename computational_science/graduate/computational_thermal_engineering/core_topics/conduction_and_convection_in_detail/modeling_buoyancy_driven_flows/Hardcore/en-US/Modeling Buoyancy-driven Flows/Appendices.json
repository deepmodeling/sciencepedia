It outlines a standard problem in the field of thermal-fluid sciences, specifically Rayleigh–Bénard convection. All required data and conditions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the governing equations for an incompressible fluid under the Boussinesq approximation. The coordinate system is defined with the $z$-axis pointing upward, opposite to the direction of gravity, so that $\\mathbf{g} = -g\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$. The fluid layer is between $z=0$ (lower plate) and $z=H$ (upper plate).\n\nThe dimensional governing equations are:\nConservation of mass (continuity):\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\nConservation of momentum (Navier-Stokes):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_m}\\nabla p^{*} + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} + g \\beta (T - T_m) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nConservation of energy:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)T = \\alpha \\nabla^2 T $$\nIn these equations, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the fluid velocity vector, $t$ is time, $p^*$ is the modified pressure (deviation from the hydrostatic profile of the reference fluid), $T$ is the temperature, $\\rho_m$ is the reference density at the mean temperature $T_m$, $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity, $\\beta$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion, and $g$ is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration.\n\nTo nondimensionalize the system, we introduce the following dimensionless variables (denoted with a prime):\n- Length: $\\mathbf{x} = H\\mathbf{x}'$\n- Time: $t = \\frac{H^2}{\\alpha}t'$ (as specified, using the thermal diffusion time scale)\n- Temperature: $\\theta = \\frac{T - T_0}{\\Delta T}$, where $T_0$ is the upper plate temperature. This gives $T = T_0 + \\theta \\Delta T$.\n- Velocity: $\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\alpha}{H}\\mathbf{u}'$ (using the thermal diffusion velocity scale)\n- Pressure: $p^* = \\frac{\\rho_m\\nu\\alpha}{H^2}p'^*$ (scaling to balance the viscous term)\n\nWe substitute these scales into the governing equations. The continuity equation, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$, becomes $\\nabla' \\cdot \\mathbf{u}' = 0$.\n\nThe energy equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha}{H^2}\\frac{\\partial (T_0 + \\theta \\Delta T)}{\\partial t'} + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{H}\\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\frac{1}{H}\\nabla'\\right)(T_0 + \\theta \\Delta T) = \\alpha \\frac{1}{H^2}\\nabla'^2(T_0 + \\theta \\Delta T) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha\\Delta T}{H^2}\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\alpha\\Delta T}{H^2}(\\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\nabla')\\theta = \\frac{\\alpha\\Delta T}{H^2}\\nabla'^2\\theta $$\nDividing by the factor $\\frac{\\alpha\\Delta T}{H^2}$, the dimensionless energy equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial t'} + (\\mathbf{u}' \\cdot \\nabla')\\theta = \\nabla'^2\\theta $$\n\nFor the momentum equation, we must handle the buoyancy term $g \\beta (T - T_m) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$.

The problem states that a spurious flow is driven by the imbalance between the discretized pressure gradient and the discretized body force. This imbalance constitutes a residual force, $F_{res}$, which acts as a source term for the momentum equation:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} \\approx F_{res} = \\left(\\frac{p_{k+1} - p_{k}}{\\Delta z}\\right) + \\rho_{k}g $$\nOur first step is to derive an analytical expression for $F_{res}$.\n\nFirst, we find the exact continuum hydrostatic pressure $p(z)$ by integrating the hydrostatic relation $\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\rho(z)g$.\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\rho_{0}\\left(1 - \\alpha \\beta z\\right)g $$\nIntegrating with respect to $z$:\n$$ p(z) = \\int -\\rho_{0}g\\left(1 - \\alpha \\beta z\\right)dz = -\\rho_{0}g\\left(z - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha \\beta z^2\\right) + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration, representing the pressure at $z=0$. Let $p(0) = p_{ref}$.\nThe discrete pressure values $p_k$ and $p_{k+1}$ are the exact values of $p(z)$ evaluated at cell centers $z_k = (k - 1/2)\\Delta z$ and $z_{k+1} = (k + 1/2)\\Delta z$.\n$$ p_{k} = p(z_k) = -\\rho_{0}g\\left(z_k - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha \\beta z_k^2\\right) + p_{ref} $$\n$$ p_{k+1} = p(z_{k+1}) = -\\rho_{0}g\\left(z_{k+1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha \\beta z_{k+1}^2\\right) + p_{ref} $$\nThe discrete pressure gradient is:\n$$ \\frac{p_{k+1} - p_{k}}{\\Delta z} = \\frac{-\\rho_{0}g}{\\Delta z} \\left[ (z_{k+1}-z_k) - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha \\beta (z_{k+1}^2 - z_k^2) \\right] $$\nWe use the identities $z_{k+1}-z_k = \\Delta z$ and $z_{k+1}^2 - z_k^2 = (z_{k+1}-z_k)(z_{k+1}+z_k) = \\Delta z ( (k+1/2)\\Delta z + (k-1/2)\\Delta z ) = \\Delta z (2k\\Delta z) = 2z_{k+1/2}\\Delta z$.\nSubstituting these into the pressure gradient expression:\n$$ \\frac{p_{k+1} - p_{k}}{\\Delta z} = -\\rho_{0}g \\left[ 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha \\beta (2z_{k+1/2}) \\right] = -\\rho_{0}g(1 - \\alpha \\beta z_{k+1/2}) $$\nThis term is the exact hydrostatic pressure gradient evaluated at the face center $z_{k+1/2}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the discretized body force term, which uses the density at the lower cell center $z_k$:\n$$ \\rho_{k}g = \\rho(z_k)g = \\rho_{0}(1 - \\alpha \\beta z_k)g $$\nNow we compute the residual force $F_{res}$:\n$$ F_{res} = -\\rho_{0}g(1 - \\alpha \\beta z_{k+1/2}) + \\rho_{0}g(1 - \\alpha \\beta z_k) $$\n$$ F_{res} = \\rho_{0}g \\left[ -(1 - \\alpha \\beta z_{k+1/2}) + (1 - \\alpha \\beta z_k) \\right] $$\n$$ F_{res} = \\rho_{0}g \\left[ -1 + \\alpha \\beta z_{k+1/2} + 1 - \\alpha \\beta z_k \\right] = \\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta (z_{k+1/2} - z_k) $$\nSince $z_{k+1/2} = k\\Delta z$ and $z_k = (k-1/2)\\Delta z$, their difference is $z_{k+1/2} - z_k = \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta z$.\n$$ F_{res} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z $$\nThe residual force is a constant, independent of the vertical position $k$. To find the resulting continuous velocity profile $w(z)$, we solve the differential equation with this constant source term:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{d^2w}{dz^2} = F_{res} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z $$\nIntegrating once with respect to $z$:\n$$ \\frac{dw}{dz} = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z}{2\\mu}z + C_1 $$\nIntegrating a second time:\n$$ w(z) = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z}{4\\mu}z^2 + C_1 z + C_2 $$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the no-slip boundary conditions $w(0)=0$ and $w(H)=0$.\nFrom $w(0)=0$:\n$$ w(0) = 0 + 0 + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2=0 $$\nFrom $w(H)=0$:\n$$ w(H) = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z}{4\\mu}H^2 + C_1 H = 0 $$\nSince $H \\neq 0$, we can solve for $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = -\\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z H}{4\\mu} $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the expression for $w(z)$:\n$$ w(z) = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z}{4\\mu}z^2 - \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z H}{4\\mu}z $$\n$$ w(z) = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z}{4\\mu}(z^2 - Hz) $$\nThis is the analytical expression for the spurious vertical velocity profile.\n\nTo find the maximum magnitude of this velocity, we find the extremum of $w(z)$ by setting its derivative to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dw}{dz} = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z}{4\\mu}(2z - H) = 0 $$\nThe extremum occurs at $z = H/2$. We substitute this back into $w(z)$ to find the maximum velocity, $w_{max}$:\n$$ w_{max} = w(H/2) = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z}{4\\mu}\\left(\\left(\\frac{H}{2}\\right)^2 - H\\left(\\frac{H}{2}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ w_{max} = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z}{4\\mu}\\left(\\frac{H^2}{4} - \\frac{H^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z}{4\\mu}\\left(-\\frac{H^2}{4}\\right) $$\n$$ w_{max} = -\\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta \\Delta z H^2}{16\\mu} $$\nThe maximum magnitude is $|w_{max}|$. Substituting $\\Delta z = H/N_z$:\n$$ |w_{max}| = \\frac{\\rho_{0}g \\alpha \\beta H^3}{16\\mu N_z} $$\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\rho_{0} = 1000\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n- $g = 9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$\n- $\\alpha = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\beta = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{K}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n- $H = 0.1\\,\\text{m}$\n- $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{s}$\n- $N_{z} = 50$\n\n$$ |w_{max}| = \\frac{(1000)(9.81)(2.0 \\times 10^{-4})(2.0 \\times 10^{-2})(0.1)^3}{16(1.0 \\times 10^{-3})(50)} $$\n$$ |w_{max}| = \\frac{10^3 \\times 9.81 \\times 4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 10^{-3}}{16 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 50} $$\n$$ |w_{max}| = \\frac{39.24 \\times 10^{-6}}{800 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{39.24 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.8} $$\n$$ |w_{max}| = 49.05 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} $$\nIn standard scientific notation and rounded to four significant figures, this is $4.905 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.",
