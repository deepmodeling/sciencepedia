            "solution": "We consider buoyancy-driven flow in a tall cavity under gravity. The Boussinesq approximation is a modeling approach that simplifies the governing equations of fluid motion at low Mach number and small temperature differences by assuming that all fluid properties are constant except the density in the gravitational body force term, where the density is linearized with temperature about a reference state.\n\nWe begin by stating the relevant equations and assumptions. The mass conservation (continuity) equation is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = 0,\n$$\nand the momentum equation (Navier–Stokes with gravity) is\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\mathbf{u} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{u} + \\rho \\mathbf{g},\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is density, $\\mathbf{u}$ is velocity, $p$ is pressure, $\\mu$ is dynamic viscosity, and $\\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration vector.\n\nThe Boussinesq approximation assumes:\n- $|\\Delta \\rho| / \\rho_{\\infty} \\ll 1$ so that $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\approx 0$ and density variations are neglected everywhere except in the buoyancy term $\\rho \\mathbf{g}$.\n- All thermophysical properties (e.g., $\\mu$, thermal conductivity $k$, specific heat $c_{p}$) are treated as constants evaluated at the ambient state.\n- Pressure variations are small compared to the thermodynamic pressure, and acoustic effects are negligible (low Mach number).\n\nWe contrast gases and liquids. For liquids, the coefficient of thermal expansion, defined as\n$$\n\\beta \\equiv -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial T} \\right)_{p},\n$$\nis typically small and varies weakly with temperature over moderate ranges. Liquids are nearly incompressible, so density is only weakly dependent on temperature and pressure. Therefore, $|\\Delta \\rho| / \\rho_{\\infty}$ remains small even for relatively large $\\Delta T$, and the assumption $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\approx 0$ is consistent. Furthermore, the linearization of $\\rho$ with respect to $T$ is accurate over a broader temperature interval, and property variations (e.g., $\\mu(T)$, $k(T)$) are often moderate.\n\nFor gases, under the ideal gas law\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{p}{R T},\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the specific gas constant, the density depends strongly on temperature at fixed pressure. The effective coefficient of thermal expansion is\n$$\n\\beta_{\\text{gas}} = \\frac{1}{T},\n$$\nwhich is comparatively large. Consequently, even modest $\\Delta T$ can produce appreciable fractional density changes, and the linearization of $\\rho(T)$ about $T_{\\infty}$ incurs a larger error margin relative to liquids. The leading source of error when applying the Boussinesq approximation to gases is the truncation of the density–temperature relation to the linear term while neglecting higher-order terms; this directly impacts the buoyancy term $\\rho \\mathbf{g}$ and the implied solenoidal constraint $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} \\approx 0$.\n\nWe now quantify the error of the Boussinesq linearization for an ideal gas at fixed ambient pressure $p_{\\infty}$. Let the local temperature be $T = T_{\\infty} + \\Delta T$, with $|\\Delta T| \\ll T_{\\infty}$ under the approximation. The exact density (ideal gas) at constant $p_{\\infty}$ is\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{exact}}(T) = \\frac{p_{\\infty}}{R T} = \\frac{p_{\\infty}}{R T_{\\infty}} \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{\\infty}}} = \\rho_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_{\\infty}} \\right)^{-1},\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\infty} \\equiv \\frac{p_{\\infty}}{R T_{\\infty}}$ is the ambient density.

Therefore,\n$$\nE = 0.10 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\left| \\frac{\\Delta T_{\\text{th}}}{T_{\\infty}} \\right| = 0.10.\n$$\nSolving for the threshold temperature difference,\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{th}} = 0.10 \\, T_{\\infty}.\n$$\nFor air at standard conditions, we are given $T_{\\infty} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Substituting,\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\text{th}} = 0.10 \\times 300 = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{K}.\n$$\nWe round to three significant figures, which yields $\\Delta T_{\\text{th}} = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nInterpretation and comparison for liquids versus gases: For an ideal gas, the coefficient of thermal expansion is $\\beta_{\\text{gas}} = 1/T_{\\infty}$, so the linear fractional density change scales like $|\\Delta \\rho|/\\rho_{\\infty} \\sim |\\Delta T|/T_{\\infty}$. The threshold derived above corresponds to a $10\\%$ fractional density change at fixed pressure, which is already substantial for buoyancy and continuity. In contrast, many liquids have much smaller and nearly constant $\\beta$ (on the order of $10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ to $10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$), so achieving the same $10\\%$ fractional density change would require $\\Delta T$ two to three orders of magnitude larger. Thus, the Boussinesq approximation is typically more robust for liquids over broad $\\Delta T$ ranges, while for gases its validity is constrained to comparatively small $\\Delta T$ by the strong temperature dependence of density under the ideal gas law. Additionally, gases often exhibit stronger temperature dependence of viscosity and thermal conductivity, which can further degrade the accuracy of Boussinesq modeling if properties are treated as constants.\n\nHence, the derived threshold for air at $1\\,\\mathrm{atm}$ and $T_{\\infty} = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, using a $10\\%$ error criterion for the density linearization in the buoyancy term, is $\\Delta T_{\\text{th}} = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$.",

The steady-state, one-dimensional heat conduction equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2T}{dz^2} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $z$ gives a general linear temperature profile:\n$$\nT(z) = C_1 z + C_2\n$$\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by the boundary conditions at the top and bottom plates.\nAt $z=0$, we have $T(0) = T_0$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\nT(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = T_0 \\implies C_2 = T_0\n$$\nAt $z=H$, we have $T(H) = T_H$. Substituting this and the value for $C_2$ gives:\n$$\nT(H) = C_1 H + T_0 = T_H \\implies C_1 = \\frac{T_H - T_0}{H}\n$$\nTherefore, the temperature profile throughout the fluid is:\n$$\nT(z) = T_0 + \\left(\\frac{T_H - T_0}{H}\\right)z\n$$\n\nStep 3: Express the density profile $\\rho(z)$ using the Boussinesq approximation.\nThe problem states that the density is governed by the Boussinesq approximation:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\rho_{ref}[1 - \\beta(T - T_{ref})]\n$$\nSubstitute the expression for $T(z)$ from Step 2 into this equation to find the density as a function of height, $\\rho(z)$:\n$$\n\\rho(z) = \\rho_{ref}\\left[1 - \\beta\\left(\\left(T_0 + \\left(\\frac{T_H - T_0}{H}\\right)z\\right) - T_{ref}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nWe can rearrange the terms inside the brackets for clarity:\n$$\n\\rho(z) = \\rho_{ref}\\left[1 - \\beta(T_0 - T_{ref}) - \\beta\\left(\\frac{T_H - T_0}{H}\\right)z\\right]\n$$\n\nStep 4: Substitute the density profile into the hydrostatic equation and integrate.\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\rho(z)$ from Step 3 into the hydrostatic equation from Step 1:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = -g \\rho_{ref}\\left[1 - \\beta(T_0 - T_{ref}) - \\beta\\left(\\frac{T_H - T_0}{H}\\right)z\\right]\n$$\nTo find the pressure $P(z)$, we integrate this differential equation from the bottom plate (where $z=0$ and $P=P_0$) to an arbitrary height $z$ (where the pressure is $P(z)$):\n$$\n\\int_{P_0}^{P(z)} dP' = \\int_{0}^{z} -g \\rho_{ref}\\left[1 - \\beta(T_0 - T_{ref}) - \\beta\\left(\\frac{T_H - T_0}{H}\\right)z'\\right] dz'\n$$\nThe left side evaluates to $P(z) - P_0$. The right side is integrated term by term:\n$$\nP(z) - P_0 = -g \\rho_{ref} \\int_{0}^{z} \\left[ (1 - \\beta(T_0 - T_{ref})) - \\left(\\frac{\\beta(T_H - T_0)}{H}\\right)z' \\right] dz'\n$$\n$$\nP(z) - P_0 = -g \\rho_{ref} \\left[ (1 - \\beta(T_0 - T_{ref}))z' - \\left(\\frac{\\beta(T_H - T_0)}{H}\\right)\\frac{z'^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{z}\n$$\nEvaluating the integral at the limits $z$ and $0$:\n$$\nP(z) - P_0 = -g \\rho_{ref} \\left( (1 - \\beta(T_0 - T_{ref}))z - \\frac{\\beta(T_H - T_0)}{2H}z^2 \\right)\n$$\nFinally, solving for $P(z)$ gives the desired pressure distribution:\n$$\nP(z) = P_0 - g \\rho_{ref} (1 - \\beta(T_0 - T_{ref}))z + g \\rho_{ref}\\frac{\\beta(T_H - T_0)}{2H}z^2\n$$\nThis expression can be slightly rearranged by distributing the terms to match a common form:\n$$\nP(z) = P_0 - g \\rho_{ref}z + g \\rho_{ref}\\beta(T_0 - T_{ref})z + g \\rho_{ref}\\frac{\\beta(T_H - T_0)}{2H}z^2\n$$\nThe derived expression is the theoretical pressure field that the CFD simulation should reproduce. It shows that the pressure is a quadratic function of height, a deviation from the linear profile found in an isothermal fluid, due to the temperature-dependent density.",
