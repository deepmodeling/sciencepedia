This exercise provides an opportunity to derive an exact analytical solution to the advection-diffusion equation, allowing us to observe precisely how a temperature profile is transported by a mean flow (advection) and simultaneously spreads out due to random thermal motion (diffusion). Understanding the evolution of the solution's mean and variance in this idealized case  offers a crucial benchmark and conceptual foundation for more complex computational problems.",

The initial condition is a Gaussian function, which is a physically realistic and mathematically well-behaved distribution. The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of transport phenomena.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is a well-posed initial value problem for a linear parabolic partial differential equation on an infinite domain.

The parameters are constants, a common and valid simplification for many physical systems.\n6.  **Other Flaws**: The problem is a standard exercise in mathematical physics and is neither trivial, tautological, nor pseudo-profound. It requires a specific analytical technique to solve.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained problem from the field of transport phenomena. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe governing equation is the advection-diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^{2} T}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nThis equation describes two physical processes: advection (transport with the mean flow) represented by the term $u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$, and diffusion (spreading due to random molecular motion) represented by the term $\\alpha \\frac{\\partial^{2} T}{\\partial x^{2}}$. The problem suggests using a moving coordinate frame. This is a natural choice to simplify the advection term.\n\nLet us define a new spatial coordinate $\\xi$ that moves with the flow at velocity $u$:\n$$\n\\xi = x - ut\n$$\nThe time coordinate $t$ remains unchanged. We define a new function $\\tilde{T}(\\xi, t) = T(x, t)$. To transform the PDE, we must express the partial derivatives with respect to $(x, t)$ in terms of partial derivatives with respect to $(\\xi, t)$ using the chain rule.\n\nThe derivative with respect to $x$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi} \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi} (1) + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial t} (0) = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi}\n$$\nThe second derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} T}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi^{2}}\n$$\nThe derivative with respect to $t$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi} \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial t} (1) + \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi} (-u) = \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial t} - u \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi}\n$$\nNow, substitute these transformed derivatives back into the original PDE:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial t} - u \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi}\\right) + u \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi}\\right) = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe advection terms cancel out, yielding the classical one-dimensional heat (or diffusion) equation in the moving frame $(\\xi, t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^{2} \\tilde{T}}{\\partial \\xi^{2}}\n$$\nNext, we transform the initial condition. At $t=0$, the moving coordinate $\\xi$ is identical to the fixed coordinate $x$, i.e., $\\xi = x - u(0) = x$. The initial condition in the new frame is:\n$$\n\\tilde{T}(\\xi, 0) = T(x,0) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,\\sigma_{0}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\xi - x_{c})^{2}}{2\\,\\sigma_{0}^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem is now reduced to solving the standard diffusion equation with a Gaussian initial condition. The solution to the diffusion equation is well-known to be the convolution of the initial condition with the fundamental solution (or heat kernel), $K(\\xi, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\alpha t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\xi^2}{4\\alpha t}\\right)$.\n\nA key property of the Gaussian distribution is that the convolution of two Gaussians is another Gaussian. The initial condition is a Gaussian with mean $x_c$ and variance $\\sigma_0^2$. The heat kernel is a Gaussian with mean $0$ and variance $2\\alpha t$. The convolution property implies that the resulting distribution will be a Gaussian whose mean is the sum of the initial means, and whose variance is the sum of the initial variances.\n\nTherefore, the solution $\\tilde{T}(\\xi, t)$ is a Gaussian distribution in $\\xi$ for all $t > 0$. Its mean is $x_c + 0 = x_c$, and its variance is $\\sigma_0^2 + 2\\alpha t$. The total integrated value $M$ is conserved. The solution in the moving frame is thus:\n$$\n\\tilde{T}(\\xi, t) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(\\sigma_{0}^{2} + 2\\alpha t)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\xi - x_{c})^{2}}{2(\\sigma_{0}^{2} + 2\\alpha t)}\\right)\n$$\nThis structure, where the solution maintains its functional form (a Gaussian) while its parameters (width) evolve in time, is characteristic of a similarity solution.\n\nTo find the solution in the original laboratory frame $(x, t)$, we substitute $\\xi = x - ut$ back into the expression for $\\tilde{T}$:\n$$\nT(x,t) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(\\sigma_{0}^{2} + 2\\alpha t)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{((x - ut) - x_{c})^{2}}{2(\\sigma_{0}^{2} + 2\\alpha t)}\\right)\n$$\nRearranging the term in the exponent gives the final form of the temperature distribution:\n$$\nT(x,t) = \\frac{M}{\\sqrt{2\\pi(\\sigma_{0}^{2} + 2\\alpha t)}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - (x_{c} + ut))^{2}}{2(\\sigma_{0}^{2} + 2\\alpha t)}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian probability density function (scaled by $M$) of the form $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$, where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma^2$ is the variance. By comparing our solution for $T(x,t)$ to this general form, we can directly identify the time-dependent mean $\\mu(t)$ and variance $\\sigma^2(t)$ of the temperature distribution.\n\nThe mean of the distribution is the center of the Gaussian:\n$$\n\\mu(t) = x_{c} + ut\n$$\nThe variance of the distribution is the term in the denominator of the exponent's quadratic part:\n$$\n\\sigma^{2}(t) = \\sigma_{0}^{2} + 2\\alpha t\n$$\nThe mean position of the temperature profile travels at the constant advection velocity $u$, starting from the initial centroid $x_c$. The variance grows linearly with time from its initial value $\\sigma_0^2$ at a rate of $2\\alpha$, which is the classic signature of a diffusive process.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the mean $\\mu(t)$ and the variance $\\sigma^2(t)$.",

            "solution": "The posed problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational fluid dynamics, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from any factual or logical contradictions. The derivation and analysis of the first-order upwind scheme, including its modified equation and stability properties, constitute a fundamental exercise in the numerical analysis of partial differential equations.\n\nThe derivation and analysis proceed in the following steps.\n\n**1. Derivation of the First-Order Upwind Scheme**\n\nThe one-dimensional linear advection equation for a scalar quantity $u(x, t)$ with a constant velocity $a$ is given by the partial differential equation (PDE) $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 0$, where the flux is $F(u) = a u$.\n\nWe start from the integral form of this conservation law applied to a control volume, or cell, $C_j = [x_{j-1/2}, x_{j+1/2}]$ of width $\\Delta x = x_{j+1/2} - x_{j-1/2}$, over a time interval $[t^n, t^{n+1}]$ of duration $\\Delta t = t^{n+1} - t^n$.\n$$\n\\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} u(x, t^{n+1}) dx - \\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} u(x, t^{n}) dx = - \\int_{t^n}^{t^{n+1}} \\left[ F(u(x_{j+1/2}, t)) - F(u(x_{j-1/2}, t)) \\right] dt\n$$\nLet $u_j^n$ be the cell-averaged value of the scalar in cell $C_j$ at time $t^n$:\n$$\nu_j^n = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\int_{x_{j-1/2}}^{x_{j+1/2}} u(x, t^{n}) dx\n$$\nThe integral form can be rewritten in terms of cell averages:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} \\Delta x - u_j^n \\Delta x = - \\int_{t^n}^{t^{n+1}} \\left[ F_{j+1/2}(t) - F_{j-1/2}(t) \\right] dt\n$$\nwhere $F_{j \\pm 1/2}(t)$ represents the flux at the cell interfaces. Using a first-order explicit Euler time integration, we approximate the time integral:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} \\Delta x - u_j^n \\Delta x \\approx -\\Delta t \\left[ F_{j+1/2}^n - F_{j-1/2}^n \\right]\n$$\nThis yields the semi-discrete finite volume update formula:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left[ F_{j+1/2}^n - F_{j-1/2}^n \\right]\n$$\nThe numerical flux $F_{j+1/2}^n$ must be chosen appropriately. The upwind principle dictates that the flux at an interface should be determined by the state from the \"upwind\" direction, i.e., the direction from which information is flowing.\n- If $a > 0$, the flow is from left to right. The flux at the interface $x_{j+1/2}$ is determined by the state in cell $j$. Thus, $F_{j+1/2} = a u_j$.\n- If $a < 0$, the flow is from right to left. The flux at the interface $x_{j+1/2}$ is determined by the state in cell $j+1$. Thus, $F_{j+1/2} = a u_{j+1}$.\n\nSubstituting these fluxes into the update formula:\n- For $a > 0$:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( a u_j^n - a u_{j-1}^n \\right) = u_j^n - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n \\right)\n$$\n- For $a < 0$:\n$$\nu_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( a u_{j+1}^n - a u_j^n \\right) = u_j^n - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( u_{j+1}^n - u_j^n \\right)\n$$\nThese are the discrete update equations for the first-order upwind method.\n\n**2. Modified Equation and Numerical Diffusion**\n\nTo quantify the leading-order truncation error, we perform a modified-equation analysis by substituting Taylor series expansions for each term in the discrete equation around the point $(x_j, t^n)$. We analyze the case $a > 0$. The scheme is $u_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\sigma(u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n)$, where $\\sigma = \\frac{a\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ is the Courant number.\n$$\nu(x_j, t^n+\\Delta t) = u_j^n - \\sigma \\left( u_j^n - u(x_j-\\Delta x, t^n) \\right)\n$$\nExpansions are:\n$u(x_j, t^n+\\Delta t) = u + \\Delta t u_t + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} u_{tt} + O(\\Delta t^3)$\n$u(x_j-\\Delta x, t^n) = u - \\Delta x u_x + \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2} u_{xx} - \\frac{\\Delta x^3}{6} u_{xxx} + O(\\Delta x^4)$\nwhere all partial derivatives are evaluated at $(x_j, t^n)$.\nSubstituting these into the scheme:\n$$\nu + \\Delta t u_t + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} u_{tt} + \\dots = u - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( u - \\left( u - \\Delta x u_x + \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2} u_{xx} + \\dots \\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t u_t + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} u_{tt} + \\dots = - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\left( \\Delta x u_x - \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2} u_{xx} + \\dots \\right)\n$$\nDividing by $\\Delta t$ and simplifying:\n$$\nu_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} u_{tt} + \\dots = -a u_x + \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} + \\dots\n$$\nTo form the modified equation, we must express time derivatives in terms of spatial derivatives. From the leading-order terms, $u_t \\approx -a u_x$. Differentiating, we get $u_{tt} \\approx -a u_{xt} = -a (u_t)_x \\approx -a (-a u_x)_x = a^2 u_{xx}$. Substituting this back:\n$$\nu_t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} (a^2 u_{xx}) = -a u_x + \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} u_{xx} + \\dots\n$$\nRearranging gives the modified PDE:\n$$\nu_t + a u_x = \\left( \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} - \\frac{a^2 \\Delta t}{2} \\right) u_{xx} + O(\\Delta x^2, \\Delta t^2)\n$$\nThe coefficient of the second spatial derivative, $u_{xx}$, is the numerical diffusion $D_{\\text{num}}$:\n$$\nD_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right) \\quad (\\text{for } a > 0)\n$$\nA similar analysis for $a < 0$ yields:\n$$\nD_{\\text{num}} = -\\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} \\left(1 + \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right) \\quad (\\text{for } a < 0)\n$$\nWe can combine these into a single expression using the absolute value of $a$ and the CFL number $\\nu = \\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$. For $a > 0$, $\\nu = \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ and $D_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} (1 - \\nu) = \\frac{|a| \\Delta x}{2} (1 - \\nu)$. For $a < 0$, $\\nu = \\frac{-a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$, so $\\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} = -\\nu$, and $D_{\\text{num}} = -\\frac{a \\Delta x}{2} (1 - \\nu) = \\frac{|a| \\Delta x}{2} (1 - \\nu)$. Thus, the general expression is:\n$$\nD_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{|a| \\Delta x}{2} \\left(1 - \\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right)\n$$\n\n**3. Fourier Analysis and Stability**\n\nWe perform a von Neumann stability analysis by substituting a single Fourier mode $u_j^n = G^n \\hat{u}^0 e^{i k x_j}$ into the discrete scheme, where $G$ is the amplification factor and $k$ is the wavenumber.\nFor $a > 0$, the scheme is $u_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\sigma(u_j^n - u_{j-1}^n)$ with $\\sigma > 0$.\n$$\nG e^{i k j \\Delta x} = e^{i k j \\Delta x} - \\sigma(e^{i k j \\Delta x} - e^{i k (j-1) \\Delta x})\n$$\n$$\nG = 1 - \\sigma(1 - e^{-i k \\Delta x})\n$$\nThe stability condition is $|G| \\le 1$ for all $k$. The squared magnitude is $|G|^2 = 1 - 2\\sigma(1-\\sigma)(1-\\cos(k\\Delta x))$. For this to be less than or equal to $1$, we require $2\\sigma(1-\\sigma)(1-\\cos(k\\Delta x)) \\ge 0$. As $1-\\cos(k\\Delta x) \\ge 0$, this requires $\\sigma(1-\\sigma) \\ge 0$, which for $\\sigma > 0$ implies $0 \\le \\sigma \\le 1$.\n\nFor $a < 0$, the scheme is $u_j^{n+1} = u_j^n - \\sigma(u_{j+1}^n - u_j^n)$ with $\\sigma < 0$.\n$$\nG e^{i k j \\Delta x} = e^{i k j \\Delta x} - \\sigma(e^{i k (j+1) \\Delta x} - e^{i k j \\Delta x})\n$$\n$$\nG = 1 - \\sigma(e^{i k \\Delta x} - 1)\n$$\nThe squared magnitude is $|G|^2 = 1 + 2\\sigma(1+\\sigma)(1-\\cos(k\\Delta x))$. For stability, we need $\\sigma(1+\\sigma) \\le 0$. Since $\\sigma < 0$, this requires $1+\\sigma \\ge 0$, or $-1 \\le \\sigma \\le 0$.\n\nCombining both cases, the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) stability condition for the first-order upwind method is $|\\sigma| = \\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\le 1$.\n\nThe numerical diffusion $D_{\\text{num}} = \\frac{|a| \\Delta x}{2}(1 - \\frac{|a| \\Delta t}{\\Delta x})$ is non-negative ($D_{\\text{num}} \\ge 0$) if and only if the CFL condition is satisfied. A positive numerical diffusion term $D_{\\text{num}} u_{xx}$ acts to dissipate, or damp, Fourier modes. The decay rate for a mode with wavenumber $k$ in the modified equation is goverened by the factor $e^{-D_{\\text{num}}k^2 t}$. This damping stabilizes the numerical scheme by preventing the growth of high-frequency oscillations that arise from discretization errors.

            "problem": "Consider the steady heat conduction operator in two spatial dimensions defined by the divergence of conductive heat flux, namely $\\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T)$, where $T$ is temperature and $k$ is thermal conductivity. Starting from the local statement of energy conservation and Fourier’s law of heat conduction, derive a second-order accurate Finite Volume Method (FVM) discretization for a structured Cartesian grid on a unit square domain $[0,1]\\times[0,1]$ with cell-centered unknowns and face-normal fluxes. The derivation must begin from the integral conservation form over a control volume and use a physically consistent definition of face flux. Explicitly show how to handle spatial variability of $k$ by using harmonic averaging at interior faces, and explain the treatment of Dirichlet boundary conditions to maintain second-order spatial accuracy. Assume $k$ is a sufficiently smooth function of position and, unless otherwise stated, depends only on the $x$-coordinate.\n\nYour program must implement the derived discretization to solve the partial differential equation\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\left(k(x)\\nabla T(x,y)\\right) = f(x,y)\n$$\non the domain $x\\in[0,1]$, $y\\in[0,1]$, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions $T(x,y) = T_{\\text{exact}}(x,y)$ prescribed on all boundaries. Use the method of manufactured solutions with\n$$\nT_{\\text{exact}}(x,y) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y),\n$$\nand choose $k(x) = k_0 + \\alpha x$ with constants $k_0 \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha \\ge 0$. Derive the corresponding source term $f(x,y)$ from the exact $T_{\\text{exact}}(x,y)$ and the chosen $k(x)$, and use the midpoint rule to approximate $\\int_{\\Omega_P} f \\, dV$ for each control volume $\\Omega_P$. The grid should be uniform with $N_x$ cells in the $x$-direction and $N_y$ cells in the $y$-direction, with cell widths $\\Delta x = 1/N_x$ and $\\Delta y = 1/N_y$. Implement harmonic averaging of $k$ at interior faces to compute face conductivities for fluxes, and treat Dirichlet boundary faces by eliminating ghost-cell values to obtain second-order consistent face coefficients and source terms. Assemble the resulting sparse linear system and solve for the cell-centered temperatures.\n\nCompute the error as the discrete $\\ell^2$ norm of the difference between the numerical solution $T_h$ and the exact solution $T_{\\text{exact}}$,\n$$\n\\|e\\|_2 = \\left(\\sum_{P} (T_h(P) - T_{\\text{exact}}(P))^2 \\, \\Delta x \\, \\Delta y \\right)^{1/2},\n$$\nand report it in kelvin.

Output the discrete $\\ell^2$ error in kelvin.\n- Case $4$ (linearly varying conductivity, observed order on refinement): $k_0 = 1$, $\\alpha = 1$, coarse grid $N_x = 20$, $N_y = 20$, fine grid $N_x = 40$, $N_y = 40$. Output the observed order $p$ as a decimal number.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the cases described above, for example, $[e_1,e_2,e_3,p_4]$, where $e_i$ are errors in kelvin and $p_4$ is dimensionless.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of a second-order accurate Finite Volume Method (FVM) for the steady-state heat conduction equation with a spatially varying thermal conductivity, $k(x)$, on a two-dimensional Cartesian grid. The derivation must originate from the fundamental principles of energy conservation and Fourier's law of heat conduction.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) for steady-state heat conduction with a source term $f$ is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\left(k \\nabla T\\right) = f $$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $k$ is the thermal conductivity, and $f$ is the volumetric heat source density.\n\nThe FVM begins with the integral form of the conservation law. Integrating the PDE over an arbitrary control volume (CV), $\\Omega_P$, gives:\n$$ \\int_{\\Omega_P} \\nabla \\cdot \\left(k \\nabla T\\right) \\, dV = \\int_{\\Omega_P} f \\, dV $$\nApplying the divergence theorem to the left-hand side transforms the volume integral of the divergence into a surface integral of the flux over the boundary of the control volume, $\\partial \\Omega_P$:\n$$ \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega_P} (k \\nabla T) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\int_{\\Omega_P} f \\, dV $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector to the surface element $dS$. The term $-(k \\nabla T)$ is Fourier's law for the heat flux vector, $\\mathbf{q}$. The equation thus represents a balance of heat fluxes across the CV boundary with the heat generated within it.\n\nWe now discretize this integral equation on a structured Cartesian grid composed of rectangular cells. Consider a generic cell, or control volume, $\\Omega_P$, centered at point $P(x_P, y_P)$ with dimensions $\\Delta x \\times \\Delta y$ and volume $V_P = \\Delta x \\Delta y$ (assuming unit depth). The boundary $\\partial \\Omega_P$ consists of four faces: east ($e$), west ($w$), north ($n$), and south ($s$). The integral balance equation becomes a sum of fluxes over these four faces:\n$$ F_e - F_w + F_n - F_s = \\bar{f}_P V_P $$\nwhere $F_f$ represents the total heat rate crossing face $f$, and $\\bar{f}_P$ is the average source term over the control volume. The total heat rate is the product of the face-normal flux density, $q_f$, and the face area, $A_f$. For our 2D grid, the areas are $A_e = A_w = \\Delta y$ and $A_n = A_s = \\Delta x$. The balance equation is:\n$$ (q_e A_e - q_w A_w) + (q_n A_n - q_s A_s) = (q_e - q_w)\\Delta y + (q_n - q_s)\\Delta x = \\bar{f}_P \\Delta x \\Delta y $$\nThe problem specifies using the midpoint rule to approximate the integrated source term, so $\\bar{f}_P \\approx f(x_P, y_P)$. The fluxes $q_f$ are the components of the heat flux vector normal to the faces, evaluated at the face centers. Using Fourier's law, we approximate these fluxes. For instance, at the east face:\n$$ q_e = (-k\\nabla T)_e \\cdot \\mathbf{i} \\approx -k_e \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right)_e $$\nwhere $k_e$ is the thermal conductivity at the east face. To maintain second-order accuracy, the gradients at the faces are approximated using central differences between the adjacent cell centers. Let $P$ denote the center of the current cell and $E, W, N, S$ denote the centers of its east, west, north, and south neighbors, respectively. The gradients are:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right)_e \\approx \\frac{T_E - T_P}{\\Delta x}, \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right)_n \\approx \\frac{T_N - T_P}{\\Delta y} $$\nThe fluxes through the four faces of cell $P$ are thus approximated as:\n$$ q_e \\approx -k_e \\frac{T_E - T_P}{\\Delta x}, \\quad q_w \\approx -k_w \\frac{T_P - T_W}{\\Delta x} $$\n$$ q_n \\approx -k_n \\frac{T_N - T_P}{\\Delta y}, \\quad q_s \\approx -k_s \\frac{T_P - T_S}{\\Delta y} $$\n\nFor a spatially variable conductivity $k(x)$, the face conductivities $k_f$ must be evaluated appropriately. For faces normal to the direction of variation (east and west faces), a simple arithmetic average of the cell-center conductivities would lead to first-order accuracy. To ensure second-order accuracy and physical consistency (continuity of flux and temperature), the harmonic mean is used. This is equivalent to modeling the heat transfer across the face as a series of thermal resistances corresponding to the two half-cells adjacent to the face.\nFor an interior east face between cells $P$ and $E$:\n$$ k_e = \\frac{2 k(x_P) k(x_E)}{k(x_P) + k(x_E)} $$\nSimilarly for the west face between cells $W$ and $P$:\n$$ k_w = \\frac{2 k(x_W) k(x_P)}{k(x_W) + k(x_P)} $$\nFor the north and south faces, which are aligned with constant $x$-coordinates, the conductivity $k(x)$ is constant along each face. Thus, no averaging is needed:\n$$ k_n = k_s = k(x_P) $$\nSubstituting these flux approximations into the balance equation yields the discretized equation for an interior cell $P$:\n$$ -k_e \\frac{T_E - T_P}{\\Delta x} \\Delta y - \\left(-k_w \\frac{T_P - T_W}{\\Delta x}\\right) \\Delta y - k_n \\frac{T_N - T_P}{\\Delta y} \\Delta x - \\left(-k_s \\frac{T_P - T_S}{\\Delta y}\\right) \\Delta x = f(x_P, y_P) \\Delta x \\Delta y $$\nRearranging to the standard linear algebraic form $a_P T_P = a_E T_E + a_W T_W + a_N T_N + a_S T_S + b_P$:\n$$ \\left( k_e \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} + k_w \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} + k_n \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y} + k_s \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y} \\right) T_P = \\left( k_e \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\right) T_E + \\left( k_w \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\right) T_W + \\left( k_n \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y} \\right) T_N + \\left( k_s \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y} \\right) T_S + f_P \\Delta x \\Delta y $$\nHere, we define the coefficients: $a_E = k_e \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$, $a_W = k_w \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$, $a_N = k_n \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y}$, $a_S = k_s \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y}$, and the central coefficient $a_P = a_E + a_W + a_N + a_S$. The source term contribution is $b_P = f(x_P, y_P) \\Delta x \\Delta y$.\n\nFor cells adjacent to a Dirichlet boundary, the treatment must be modified to maintain second-order accuracy. Consider a cell $P$ at the west boundary ($x=0$). The west face of the cell lies on the boundary, where the temperature $T_b$ is known. The distance from the cell center $P$ to this boundary is $\\Delta x/2$. The gradient at the west face is approximated using the cell-center and boundary values:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right)_w \\approx \\frac{T_P - T_{b,w}}{\\Delta x / 2} $$\nwhere $T_{b,w} = T_{\\text{exact}}(0, y_P)$. The flux through the west face is $q_w = -k_w (\\frac{T_P - T_{b,w}}{\\Delta x/2})$, where $k_w = k(0)$ is the conductivity at the boundary. The term in the balance equation is $-q_w \\Delta y$. The coefficient for the west face becomes $a_W = k(0) \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x/2} = 2k(0)\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$. This modifies the linear equation for the boundary cell: the term $a_W T_W$ is replaced by a known value added to the source term. The final equation for a cell $P$ on the west boundary is:\n$$ (a_E + a_W + a_N + a_S) T_P - a_E T_E - a_N T_N - a_S T_S = b_P + a_W T_{b,w} $$\nThis procedure is applied analogously to all other boundaries (east, north, south), adjusting the coefficient and source term for the respective boundary face. This \"ghost cell\" elimination with a half-cell distance ensures the gradient approximation at the boundary is second-order, thus preserving the overall accuracy of the scheme.\n\nFinally, we use the method of manufactured solutions to define the source term $f(x,y)$. Given $T_{\\text{exact}}(x,y) = \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)$ and $k(x) = k_0 + \\alpha x$, we compute $f(x,y) = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T_{\\text{exact}})$.\nWith $\\nabla T_{\\text{exact}} = \\langle \\pi\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y), \\pi\\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y) \\rangle$, we have:\n$$ f(x,y) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left((k_0+\\alpha x)\\pi\\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y)\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left((k_0+\\alpha x)\\pi\\sin(\\pi x)\\cos(\\pi y)\\right) $$\n$$ f(x,y) = \\pi\\sin(\\pi y)\\left[\\alpha\\cos(\\pi x) - (k_0+\\alpha x)\\pi\\sin(\\pi x)\\right] + (k_0+\\alpha x)\\pi\\sin(\\pi x)\\left[-\\pi\\sin(\\pi y)\\right] $$\n$$ f(x,y) = \\pi \\alpha \\cos(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) - 2\\pi^2 (k_0 + \\alpha x) \\sin(\\pi x)\\sin(\\pi y) $$\nThis function is used to compute the source term $b_P$ for each cell. Assembling the equations for all $N_x \\times N_y$ cells results in a sparse linear system $A\\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{b}$, which can be solved for the vector of cell-centered temperatures $\\mathbf{T}$.",
