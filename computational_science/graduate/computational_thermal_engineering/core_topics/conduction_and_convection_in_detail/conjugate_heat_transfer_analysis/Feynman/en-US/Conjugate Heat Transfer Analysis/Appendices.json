It represents a standard problem in one-dimensional, steady-state heat transfer.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of heat transfer, is well-posed with a clear objective, and is free from ambiguity or contradiction. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe primary task is to construct a dimensionless parameter $\\Pi$ defined as the ratio of the total radial conduction resistance of the composite wall to the internal convective resistance. The analysis will be performed on a per-unit-length basis, as the heat transfer is specified as being one-dimensional in the radial direction. Let $R'$ denote a thermal resistance per unit length, with units of $\\mathrm{K} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{W}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the internal convective resistance per unit length, $R'_{\\text{conv,i}}$. According to Newton's law of cooling, the heat transfer rate per unit length, $q'$, from the bulk fluid at temperature $T_b$ to the inner pipe surface at temperature $T_{s,i}$ is given by:\n$$q' = h_i A'_i (T_b - T_{s,i})$$\nwhere $h_i$ is the internal convective heat transfer coefficient and $A'_i$ is the inner surface area per unit length. For a circular pipe of inner radius $r_i$, this area is $A'_i = 2 \\pi r_i$. The thermal resistance is defined as the temperature difference divided by the heat rate, so:\n$$R'_{\\text{conv,i}} = \\frac{|T_b - T_{s,i}|}{q'} = \\frac{1}{h_i A'_i} = \\frac{1}{h_i (2 \\pi r_i)}$$\nThe problem provides the Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}_i$, based on the inner diameter $D_i = 2 r_i$:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu}_i = \\frac{h_i D_i}{k_f} = \\frac{h_i (2 r_i)}{k_f}$$\nwhere $k_f$ is the thermal conductivity of the fluid. We can express $h_i$ in terms of $\\mathrm{Nu}_i$:\n$$h_i = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}_i k_f}{2 r_i}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $h_i$ into the equation for $R'_{\\text{conv,i}}$ yields:\n$$R'_{\\text{conv,i}} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}_i k_f}{2 r_i}\\right) (2 \\pi r_i)} = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\mathrm{Nu}_i k_f}$$\n\nNext, we determine the total conduction resistance of the composite wall per unit length, $R'_{\\text{cond,total}}$. The wall consists of $m$ concentric cylindrical layers in series. The total conduction resistance is the sum of the individual resistances of each layer:\n$$R'_{\\text{cond,total}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} R'_{\\text{cond},j}$$\nFor a single hollow cylindrical layer $j$ with inner radius $r_{j,i}$, outer radius $r_{j,o}$, and thermal conductivity $k_{s,j}$, the resistance to steady, radial heat conduction is derived from Fourier's law. In cylindrical coordinates, the heat conduction equation for heat rate per unit length $q'$ is:\n$$q' = -k_{s,j} (2 \\pi r) \\frac{dT}{dr}$$\nSeparating variables and integrating across the layer from $r_{j,i}$ to $r_{j,o}$ (and from temperature $T_{j,i}$ to $T_{j,o}$):\n$$\\int_{r_{j,i}}^{r_{j,o}} \\frac{q'}{2 \\pi k_{s,j}} \\frac{dr}{r} = -\\int_{T_{j,i}}^{T_{j,o}} dT$$\n$$ \\frac{q'}{2 \\pi k_{s,j}} [\\ln(r)]_{r_{j,i}}^{r_{j,o}} = T_{j,i} - T_{j,o} $$\nThe conduction resistance for layer $j$ per unit length is thus:\n$$R'_{\\text{cond},j} = \\frac{T_{j,i} - T_{j,o}}{q'} = \\frac{\\ln(r_{j,o}/r_{j,i})}{2 \\pi k_{s,j}}$$\nSumming over all $m$ layers gives the total conduction resistance per unit length:\n$$R'_{\\text{cond,total}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{\\ln(r_{j,o}/r_{j,i})}{2 \\pi k_{s,j}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k_{s,j}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{j,o}}{r_{j,i}}\\right)$$\n\nThe dimensionless heat flux coupling parameter $\\Pi$ is defined as the ratio of these two resistances:\n$$\\Pi = \\frac{R'_{\\text{cond,total}}}{R'_{\\text{conv,i}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k_{s,j}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{j,o}}{r_{j,i}}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\pi \\mathrm{Nu}_i k_f}}$$\nSimplifying the expression, we obtain:\n$$\\Pi = \\frac{\\pi \\mathrm{Nu}_i k_f}{2 \\pi} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k_{s,j}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{j,o}}{r_{j,i}}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{Nu}_i k_f}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k_{s,j}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{j,o}}{r_{j,i}}\\right)$$\nThis final expression is dimensionless, as required.\n\nFor the second part of the analysis, we consider the simplifying assumption that all solid layers share a common thermal conductivity, $k_{s,j} = k_s$ for $j = 1, \\dots, m$.

The heat flux is:\n$$\nF_{fs} = -A k_s \\frac{T_S - T_{int}}{x_S - L_f} = A k_s \\frac{T_{int} - T_S}{\\delta_{S}^{w}}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the temperature drop from the interface to the solid cell center:\n$$\nT_{int} - T_S = F_{fs} \\frac{\\delta_{S}^{w}}{A k_s}\n$$\nHere, the thermal resistance of the solid half-cell is $R_{th,s} = \\frac{\\delta_{S}^{w}}{A k_s}$.\n\nThe problem requires a conservative expression for the flux, which is ensured by imposing the continuity of heat flux at the interface. Our formulation inherently satisfies this, as we have used the same flux, $F_{fs}$, for both the fluid and solid sides. To find an expression for $F_{fs}$ that depends only on the cell-center temperatures $T_P$ and $T_S$, we must eliminate the unknown interface temperature $T_{int}$. We can achieve this by adding the two temperature drop equations:\n$$\n(T_P - T_{int}) + (T_{int} - T_S) = F_{fs} \\frac{\\delta_{P}^{e}}{A k_f} + F_{fs} \\frac{\\delta_{S}^{w}}{A k_s}\n$$\nThe interface temperature $T_{int}$ cancels out, leaving the total temperature drop between the two adjacent cell centers:\n$$\nT_P - T_S = F_{fs} \\left( \\frac{\\delta_{P}^{e}}{A k_f} + \\frac{\\delta_{S}^{w}}{A k_s} \\right)\n$$\nThis demonstrates the principle of adding thermal resistances in series. The total resistance between nodes $P$ and $S$ is the sum of the fluid-side and solid-side resistances: $R_{th,total} = R_{th,f} + R_{th,s}$.\n\nFinally, we solve for the interface heat flux $F_{fs}$:\n$$\nF_{fs} = \\frac{T_P - T_S}{\\frac{\\delta_{P}^{e}}{A k_f} + \\frac{\\delta_{S}^{w}}{A k_s}}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten by factoring out the area $A$ from the denominator:\n$$\nF_{fs} = \\frac{A(T_P - T_S)}{\\frac{\\delta_{P}^{e}}{k_f} + \\frac{\\delta_{S}^{w}}{k_s}}\n$$\nThis expression is conservative and is based on the specified thermal resistance model. It is a standard practice in FVM for CHT to use a harmonic mean for the interface thermal conductivity to ensure flux continuity, and this formulation is the direct result of that principle. The derived expression depends only on the specified variables: $A$, $k_f$, $k_s$, $\\delta_{P}^{e}$, $\\delta_{S}^{w}$, $T_P$, and $T_S$. A sign error in the original solution's derivation of the Fourier's Law expression has been corrected in this version, though it does not affect the final answer.",
