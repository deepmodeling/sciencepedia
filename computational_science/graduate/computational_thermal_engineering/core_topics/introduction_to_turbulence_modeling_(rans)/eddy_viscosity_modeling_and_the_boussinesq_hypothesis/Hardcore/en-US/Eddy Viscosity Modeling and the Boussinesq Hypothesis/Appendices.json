The specified flow, a simple shear flow, is a canonical case used in textbooks to introduce these concepts. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and parameters for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The numerical values are physically realistic for a fluid like air under significant shear. The problem is fully formalizable within the framework of fluid mechanics and does not violate any scientific principles or contain internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nWe begin by applying the Reynolds decomposition to the velocity field. For a turbulent flow, the instantaneous velocity component $u_i$ is decomposed into a mean component $\\overline{u_i}$ and a fluctuating component $u_i'$, such that $u_i = \\overline{u_i} + u_i'$. For the given plane shear flow, the mean velocity field is $\\overline{\\mathbf{u}} = (U(y), 0, 0)$, where $U(y) = Sy$.\n\nThe Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for an incompressible fluid with constant properties are given by:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u_i}}{\\partial t} + \\rho \\overline{u_j} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u_i}}{\\partial x_j} = -\\frac{\\partial \\overline{p}}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( \\mu \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u_i}}{\\partial x_j} - \\rho \\overline{u_i' u_j'} \\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\tau_{ij}^R = -\\rho \\overline{u_i' u_j'}$ is the Reynolds stress tensor, representing the effect of turbulent fluctuations on the mean flow.\n\nFor a statistically stationary flow, all time derivatives of mean quantities are zero ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$). For a plane shear flow with $\\overline{\\mathbf{u}} = (U(y), 0, 0)$, the mean momentum equation in the streamwise ($x$) direction simplifies significantly. Assuming homogeneity in the $x$ and $z$ directions for mean quantities (a standard assumption for such flows), the equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{d \\overline{p}}{dx} + \\frac{d}{dy} \\left( \\mu \\frac{dU}{dy} - \\rho \\overline{u'v'} \\right)\n$$\nThe total shear stress in the flow, $\\tau_{total}$, is the sum of the mean viscous stress, $\\tau_{yx}^{visc} = \\mu \\frac{dU}{dy}$, and the turbulent shear stress (also known as Reynolds shear stress), $\\tau_{yx}^{turb} = -\\rho \\overline{u'v'}$.\nSo, $\\tau_{total} = \\tau_{yx}^{visc} + \\tau_{yx}^{turb} = \\mu \\frac{dU}{dy} - \\rho \\overline{u'v'}$.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the turbulent shear stress term. The Boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis provides an analogy to molecular viscous stress by introducing an eddy viscosity, $\\mu_t$. For this specific flow configuration, the hypothesis states:\n$$\n\\tau_{yx}^{turb} = -\\rho \\overline{u'v'} = \\mu_t \\frac{dU}{dy}\n$$\n\nNext, we use the Prandtl mixing-length model to obtain an expression for the turbulent stress. This model relates the velocity fluctuations to the mean velocity gradient through a characteristic length scale, $l$, the mixing length. It proposes that the Reynolds shear stress is given by:\n$$\n-\\rho \\overline{u'v'} = \\rho l^2 \\left| \\frac{dU}{dy} \\right| \\frac{dU}{dy}\n$$\n\nBy equating the Boussinesq expression and the Prandtl model expression for the turbulent shear stress, we get:\n$$\n\\mu_t \\frac{dU}{dy} = \\rho l^2 \\left| \\frac{dU}{dy} \\right| \\frac{dU}{dy}\n$$\nSolving for the eddy viscosity, $\\mu_t$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mu_t = \\rho l^2 \\left| \\frac{dU}{dy} \\right|\n$$\nThis is the general expression for eddy viscosity based on the mixing-length model.\n\nFor the specific mean velocity profile given, $U(y) = Sy$, the mean shear rate is:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dy} = S\n$$\nSince the problem states that $S  0$, the absolute value is simply $S$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\mu_t$:\n$$\n\\mu_t = \\rho l^2 S\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the eddy viscosity in terms of $\\rho$, $l$, and $S$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $\\mu_t$ and the ratio $R = \\mu_t / \\mu$ using the provided numerical parameters:\n$\\rho = 1.20 \\ \\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n$\\mu = 1.80 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{Pa}\\,\\text{s}$\n$S = 500 \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$l = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the eddy viscosity $\\mu_t$:\n$$\n\\mu_t = (1.20 \\ \\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m})^2 \\times (500 \\ \\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_t = 1.20 \\times (1.00 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 500 \\ \\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_t = 600 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{Pa}\\,\\text{s} = 6.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{Pa}\\,\\text{s}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\mu_t}{\\mu} = \\frac{6.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{Pa}\\,\\text{s}}{1.80 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\text{Pa}\\,\\text{s}}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{6.00}{1.80} \\times \\frac{10^{-4}}{10^{-5}} = \\frac{6.00}{1.80} \\times 10^1\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{60.0}{1.80} = \\frac{100}{3} \\approx 33.333...\n$$\nThe problem asks for the final value of $R$ to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 33.3\n$$\nThis dimensionless ratio indicates that for the given conditions, the turbulent transport of momentum is about $33.3$ times more effective than the molecular (viscous) transport.",

The premises are consistent and realistic for a computational engineering problem. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution requires deriving expressions for the eddy viscosity ($\\mu_t$), wall shear stress ($\\tau_w$), and wall heat flux ($|q_w|$) based on the provided model, and then evaluating the sensitivity of these quantities to a change in the coefficient $C_\\mu$.\n\n**1. Governing Relations**\n\n**Eddy Viscosity ($\\mu_t$)**\nIn the context of high-Reynolds-number $k-\\varepsilon$ turbulence models, the eddy viscosity, $\\mu_t$, is related to the turbulent kinetic energy, $k_{\\text{tke}}$, and its dissipation rate, $\\varepsilon$, through the following relation:\n$$ \\mu_t = \\rho C_{\\mu} \\frac{k_{\\text{tke}}^2}{\\varepsilon} $$\nThis expression stems from dimensional analysis, where $k_{\\text{tke}}^2/\\varepsilon$ provides the correct units for a kinematic viscosity.\n\n**Wall Shear Stress ($\\tau_w$)**\nThe Boussinesq hypothesis relates the Reynolds shear stress to the mean velocity gradient:\n$$ -\\rho \\overline{u'v'} = \\mu_t \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} $$\nThe total shear stress, $\\tau$, is the sum of the molecular (laminar) and turbulent contributions:\n$$ \\tau = \\mu \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} - \\rho \\overline{u'v'} = (\\mu + \\mu_t) \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} $$\nThe problem specifies using a \"near-wall gradient approximation\" to find the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. This implies a first-order finite difference approximation for the velocity gradient based on the wall-adjacent cell center $P$. Assuming a stationary wall ($U_w = 0$ at $y=0$), the gradient is approximated as:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{\\text{wall}} \\approx \\frac{U_P - 0}{y_P - 0} = \\frac{U_P}{y_P} $$\nThe effective viscosity $(\\mu + \\mu_t)$ is evaluated at the cell center $P$. Thus, the wall shear stress is approximated as:\n$$ \\tau_w \\approx (\\mu + \\mu_t) \\frac{U_P}{y_P} $$\n\n**Wall Heat Flux ($|q_w|$)**\nAnalogous to momentum transfer, the turbulent heat flux is modeled by the gradient diffusion hypothesis:\n$$ -\\rho c_p \\overline{v'T'} = k_t \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} $$\nwhere $k_t$ is the turbulent thermal conductivity. The total heat flux, $q_w$, is the sum of molecular and turbulent contributions:\n$$ q_w = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} - \\rho c_p \\overline{v'T'} = -(k + k_t) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} $$\nThe turbulent thermal conductivity $k_t$ is related to the eddy viscosity $\\mu_t$ via the turbulent Prandtl number, $\\Pr_t$:\n$$ k_t = \\frac{\\mu_t c_p}{\\Pr_t} $$\nUsing the same near-wall gradient approximation for the temperature field:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\bigg|_{\\text{wall}} \\approx \\frac{T_P - T_w}{y_P - 0} $$\nThe magnitude of the wall heat flux is therefore:\n$$ |q_w| = (k + k_t) \\frac{|T_P - T_w|}{y_P} = \\left( k + \\frac{\\mu_t c_p}{\\Pr_t} \\right) \\frac{T_P - T_w}{y_P} $$\nsince $T_P  T_w$.\n\n**2.

All other fundamental parameters ($\\rho$, $\\mu$, $c_p$, $k$, $\\Pr_t$, $k_{\\text{tke}}$, $\\varepsilon$, etc.) are constant.\n\n**Factor for Eddy Viscosity ($F_{\\mu_t}$)**\nThe factor is the ratio of the new eddy viscosity to the old one:\n$$ F_{\\mu_t} = \\frac{\\mu_{t,2}}{\\mu_{t,1}} = \\frac{\\rho C_{\\mu,2} k_{\\text{tke}}^2 / \\varepsilon}{\\rho C_{\\mu,1} k_{\\text{tke}}^2 / \\varepsilon} = \\frac{C_{\\mu,2}}{C_{\\mu,1}} $$\nGiven $C_{\\mu,2} = 1.10 C_{\\mu,1}$, the factor is exactly:\n$$ F_{\\mu_t} = 1.10 $$\n\n**Factor for Wall Shear Stress ($F_{\\tau_w}$)**\nThe factor is the ratio of the new wall shear stress to the old one:\n$$ F_{\\tau_w} = \\frac{\\tau_{w,2}}{\\tau_{w,1}} = \\frac{(\\mu + \\mu_{t,2}) U_P / y_P}{(\\mu + \\mu_{t,1}) U_P / y_P} = \\frac{\\mu + \\mu_{t,2}}{\\mu + \\mu_{t,1}} $$\nSince $\\mu_{t,2} = F_{\\mu_t} \\mu_{t,1} = 1.10 \\mu_{t,1}$, we have:\n$$ F_{\\tau_w} = \\frac{\\mu + 1.10 \\mu_{t,1}}{\\mu + \\mu_{t,1}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the initial eddy viscosity, $\\mu_{t,1}$:\n$$ \\mu_{t,1} = \\rho C_{\\mu,1} \\frac{k_{\\text{tke}}^2}{\\varepsilon} = (1.20) (0.0900) \\frac{(0.80)^2}{40.0} = 0.108 \\times \\frac{0.64}{40.0} = 0.001728\\,\\text{Pa}\\,\\text{s} $$\nNow, we substitute the values of $\\mu$ and $\\mu_{t,1}$ into the expression for $F_{\\tau_w}$:\n$$ F_{\\tau_w} = \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^{-5} + 1.10 \\times 0.001728}{1.80 \\times 10^{-5} + 0.001728} = \\frac{0.000018 + 0.0019008}{0.000018 + 0.001728} = \\frac{0.0019188}{0.001746} \\approx 1.098969... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $F_{\\tau_w} = 1.099$.\n\n**Factor for Wall Heat Flux ($F_{q_w}$)**\nThe factor is the ratio of the new wall heat flux magnitude to the old one:\n$$ F_{q_w} = \\frac{|q_{w,2}|}{|q_{w,1}|} = \\frac{(k + k_{t,2}) (T_P-T_w)/y_P}{(k + k_{t,1}) (T_P-T_w)/y_P} = \\frac{k + k_{t,2}}{k + k_{t,1}} $$\nSince $k_t \\propto \\mu_t$, we have $k_{t,2} = 1.10 k_{t,1}$. The factor becomes:\n$$ F_{q_w} = \\frac{k + 1.10 k_{t,1}}{k + k_{t,1}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the initial turbulent thermal conductivity, $k_{t,1}$:\n$$ k_{t,1} = \\frac{\\mu_{t,1} c_p}{\\Pr_t} = \\frac{0.001728 \\times 1005}{0.85} = \\frac{1.73664}{0.85} \\approx 2.043106\\,\\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} $$\nNow, we substitute the values of $k$ and $k_{t,1}$:\n$$ F_{q_w} = \\frac{0.026 + 1.10 \\times 2.043106}{0.026 + 2.043106} = \\frac{0.026 + 2.2474166}{2.069106} = \\frac{2.2734166}{2.069106} \\approx 1.098743... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $F_{q_w} = 1.099$.\n\nThe contribution of molecular transport terms ($\\mu$ and $k$) is small compared to the turbulent transport terms ($\\mu_t$ and $k_t$), as $\\mu_t/\\mu \\approx 96$ and $k_t/k \\approx 79$.

The equations for momentum, strain rate, and turbulent production are standard.

The provided momentum equation is consistent with this interpretation for the specified shear flow. There are no internal contradictions.\n-   **Other Flaws**: The problem does not exhibit any of the other invalidity flags. It is not trivial, metaphorical, or unverifiable.

It represents a well-posed conceptual question in the field of fluid dynamics and turbulence modeling. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the consequences of having a negative turbulent viscosity, $\\mu_t  0$, within the Boussinesq eddy-viscosity framework. We will analyze its impact on three key aspects: turbulent kinetic energy production, the stability of the mean momentum equation, and the physical interpretation of the turbulent stress.\n\n**1. Impact on Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) Production**\n\nThe production of TKE, $P_k$, represents the rate of energy transfer from the mean flow to the turbulent fluctuations. It is defined as $P_k = -\\overline{u_i' u_j'} \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j}$.\nFor the specified planar shear flow, $U_i = (U(y,t), 0, 0)$, the only nonzero mean velocity gradient component relevant to the product is $\\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$.\nThus, the expression for production simplifies to:\n$$P_k = -\\overline{u_x' u_y'} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$$\nThe Boussinesq hypothesis relates the Reynolds shear stress $-\\rho\\overline{u_x' u_y'}$ to the mean strain rate. The problem defines the model for the turbulent stress as $\\tau_{ij}$. For the off-diagonal shear component, this gives:\n$$\\tau_{xy} = 2 \\mu_t S_{xy} - \\frac{2}{3} \\rho k \\delta_{xy} = 2 \\mu_t \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\mu_t \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$$\nAssuming the standard convention that $\\tau_{ij}$ in the problem statement is the model for the Reynolds stress tensor $-\\rho \\overline{u_i' u_j'}$, we have $-\\rho \\overline{u_x' u_y'} = \\mu_t \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$.\nDividing by $\\rho$, we get $-\\overline{u_x' u_y'} = \\frac{\\mu_t}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P_k$:\n$$P_k = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_t}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\right) \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\mu_t}{\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\right)^2$$\nSince $\\rho  0$ and $\\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 \\ge 0$, the sign of $P_k$ is determined by the sign of $\\mu_t$. If $\\mu_t  0$, then $P_k \\le 0$. A negative TKE production signifies a reversal of the normal energy cascade; instead of the mean flow losing energy to produce turbulence, the turbulent fluctuations are losing energy to the mean flow. This process is known as \"backscatter.\" This contradicts the fundamental physical picture behind simple eddy-viscosity models, which assume that turbulence is a purely dissipative phenomenon for the mean flow, characterized by a forward energy cascade from large to small scales.\n\n**2. Impact on the Mean Momentum Equation and Stability**\n\nThe provided mean momentum equation is:\n$$\\rho \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left[ \\left( \\mu + \\mu_t \\right) \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\right] + \\dots$$\nDividing by $\\rho$ and defining an effective kinematic viscosity $\\nu_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\mu + \\mu_t}{\\rho}$, the equation takes the form of a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\nu_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\right) + \\dots = \\nu_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial \\nu_{\\text{eff}}}{\\partial y} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} + \\dots$$\nThe stability of this partial differential equation (PDE) for short-wavelength (high-wavenumber) perturbations is governed by the sign of the coefficient of the highest-order spatial derivative, which is $\\nu_{\\text{eff}}$.\nThe problem states that in the layer, $\\mu_t = -\\alpha \\mu$ for some $\\alpha  0$.\nThe effective dynamic viscosity is $\\mu_{\\text{eff}} = \\mu + \\mu_t = \\mu - \\alpha \\mu = \\mu (1-\\alpha)$.\n- If $0  \\alpha  1$, then $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}  0$. The net viscosity is reduced, but the equation remains a forward-parabolic diffusion equation, which is stable.\n- If $\\alpha  1$, which corresponds to $|\\mu_t|  \\mu$, then $\\mu_{\\text{eff}}  0$. The effective kinematic viscosity $\\nu_{\\text{eff}}$ becomes negative.\nLet's analyze the stability of the equation $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t} = \\nu_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial y^2}$ when $\\nu_{\\text{eff}}  0$. Let $\\nu_{\\text{eff}} = -|\\nu_{\\text{eff}}|$. The equation is a backward heat equation: $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial t} = -|\\nu_{\\text{eff}}| \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial y^2}$.\nConsider a small perturbation of the form $U'(y,t) = \\hat{U} e^{\\sigma t} e^{iK_y y}$, where $K_y$ is the wavenumber in the $y$-direction. Substituting into the PDE yields:\n$$\\sigma \\hat{U} e^{\\sigma t} e^{iK_y y} = \\nu_{\\text{eff}} (iK_y)^2 \\hat{U} e^{\\sigma t} e^{iK_y y}$$\n$$\\sigma = \\nu_{\\text{eff}} (-K_y^2) = (-|\\nu_{\\text{eff}}|) (-K_y^2) = |\\nu_{\\text{eff}}| K_y^2$$\nSince $\\sigma  0$, the amplitude of the perturbation grows exponentially as $e^{\\sigma t} = \\exp\\left( |\\nu_{\\text{eff}}| K_y^2 t \\right)$. The growth rate is proportional to $K_y^2$, meaning that perturbations with smaller wavelengths (larger $K_y$) grow fastest. This makes the problem ill-posed; any numerical simulation would immediately fail due to the unbounded amplification of high-frequency noise (like round-off error).\n\n**3. Impact on Turbulent Shear Stress**\n\nThe turbulent shear stress is modeled as $\\tau_{xy} = \\mu_t \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$. This stress represents a flux of $x$-momentum in the $y$-direction. For a typical boundary layer, the mean velocity gradient $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$ is positive.\n-   **Standard case ($\\mu_t  0$)**: $\\tau_{xy}  0$. This positive stress acts to slow down faster fluid and speed up slower fluid, resulting in a diffusive flux of momentum down the velocity gradient, which smooths the profile. This is consistent with the molecular shear stress $\\tau_{\\text{mol}, xy} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}  0$.\n-   **Negative viscosity case ($\\mu_t  0$)**: With $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}  0$, the turbulent shear stress becomes $\\tau_{xy}  0$. This stress has the opposite sign to the molecular stress and acts counter-intuitively. A negative stress implies an \"up-gradient\" flux of momentum, transporting momentum from regions of lower velocity to regions of higher velocity. This process is anti-diffusive and acts to steepen velocity gradients, rather than smooth them. This behavior is fundamentally at odds with the intended purpose of an eddy-viscosity model, which is to represent the enhanced mixing and dissipation caused by turbulence.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In the layer, the turbulent kinetic energy production simplifies (under the Boussinesq hypothesis and incompressibility) to $ P_k = \\frac{\\mu_t}{\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 $, which becomes negative; this represents energy transfer from turbulence to the mean (backscatter) and contradicts the dissipative forward-cascade character implicitly assumed by eddy-viscosity closures.**\nAs derived in point (1), the formula for $P_k$ is correct. With $\\mu_t  0$, $P_k$ becomes negative. This correctly identifies the phenomenon as backscatter (energy transfer from turbulence to the mean flow), which violates the physical premise of simple eddy-viscosity models.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If $|\\mu_t|  \\mu$ in the layer, the effective kinematic viscosity $ \\nu_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\mu + \\mu_t}{\\rho} $ becomes negative, turning the diffusion operator into a backward-parabolic operator and making high-wavenumber perturbations grow as $ \\exp\\left( |\\nu_{\\text{eff}}| k^2 t \\right) $, which is ill-posed and leads to severe numerical instability.**\nAs derived in point (2), if $|\\mu_t|  \\mu$, the effective viscosity $\\mu + \\mu_t$ becomes negative. This turns the diffusion term into that of a backward heat equation. The stability analysis is correct and shows that high-wavenumber perturbations grow exponentially with a rate proportional to the square of the wavenumber, leading to ill-posedness and numerical divergence. (Note: the option uses $k$ for wavenumber, which is consistent with standard notation, although I used $K_y$ to avoid confusion with the turbulent kinetic energy $k$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. A negative $\\mu_t$ merely reduces the net viscosity; therefore it is always stabilizing, decreasing gradients and suppressing turbulence, with no implications for energy transfer.**\nThis statement is incorrect on all counts. A negative $\\mu_t$ can make the net viscosity negative, which is not a mere reduction. As shown in B, this leads to catastrophic instability, not stabilization. It leads to the steepening of gradients (anti-diffusion), not a decrease. It has direct implications for the TKE budget, causing negative production.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. With $\\mu_t  0$ and $ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}  0 $, the turbulent shear stress $ \\tau_{xy} = \\mu_t \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} $ is negative, opposite in sign to the molecular shear stress $ \\mu \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}  0 $, implying an anti-diffusive momentum flux that steepens the mean velocity gradient, contradicting the dissipative role intended in Boussinesq-type eddy-viscosity models.**\nAs analyzed in point (3), a negative $\\mu_t$ with a positive velocity gradient results in a negative turbulent shear stress, which is opposite to the positive molecular shear stress. This describes an anti-diffusive or up-gradient transport of momentum. As established by the stability analysis (point 2), such a system leads to the steepening of gradients. This behavior is contrary to the dissipative and diffusive nature that eddy-viscosity models are designed to capture.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The presence of a negative $\\mu_t$ is harmless as long as the molecular viscosity $\\mu$ is positive, because the Second Law of Thermodynamics only constrains $\\mu$, and $\\mu_t$ is a modeling artifact without consequences for stability or energy budgets.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. While it is true that the Second Law of Thermodynamics directly constrains $\\mu \\ge 0$ and that $\\mu_t$ is a modeling coefficient, to claim it has no consequences is false. The mathematical behavior of the model equations is entirely determined by the coefficients within them. As shown in A and B, a negative $\\mu_t$ has severe consequences for both the energy budget ($P_k0$) and the mathematical stability of the momentum equation, rendering the model ill-posed if $|\\mu_t|  \\mu$. A \"modeling artifact\" with such consequences is not \"harmless\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
