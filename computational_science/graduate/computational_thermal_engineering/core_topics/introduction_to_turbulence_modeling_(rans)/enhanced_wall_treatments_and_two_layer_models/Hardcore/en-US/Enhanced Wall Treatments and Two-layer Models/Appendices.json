            "problem": "An automated plagiarism detection tool analyzes a document to determine its likely origin. The document is known to be either from a British source or an American source.\n\nLet $B$ be the event that the document is from a British source, and let $A$ be the event that it is from an American source. These two events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The prior probability that the document is from a British source is $P(B) = p_B$.\n\nThe tool checks for specific spellings. Let $E$ be the event that the tool finds the word spelled as \"flavour\" (the common British spelling) instead of \"flavor\" (the common American spelling). The conditional probabilities for this event are known:\n- The probability of observing the spelling \"flavour\" given the source is British is $P(E|B) = q_B$.\n- The probability of observing the spelling \"flavour\" given the source is American is $P(E|A) = q_A$.\n\nGiven that the tool has found the spelling \"flavour\" in the document, derive an expression for the posterior probability that the document is from a British source, $P(B|E)$. Express your answer in terms of $p_B$, $q_B$, and $q_A$.",
