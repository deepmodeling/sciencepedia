Relationship between $u^{+}(y^{+})$ and $T^{+}(y^{+})$ under Reynolds analogy with $Pr = 1$.\n\nThe total shear stress and heat flux are modeled as\n$$\\tau(y) = \\rho\\left(\\nu + \\nu_t(y)\\right)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y}, \\qquad q''(y) = -\\rho c_p\\left(\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y)\\right)\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}y}.$$\nIn the inner region of the turbulent boundary layer, the total shear stress is approximately constant and equal to the wall shear stress,\n$$\\tau(y) \\approx \\tau_w = \\rho u_{\\ast}^{2},$$\nwhich implies\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{u_{\\ast}^{2}}{\\nu + \\nu_t(y)}.$$\nFor heat transfer with a uniform nonzero wall heat flux $q_w$, we have $q''(y) \\approx q_w$ in the inner region, leading to\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}y} = -\\frac{q_w}{\\rho c_p}\\,\\frac{1}{\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y)}.$$\nUnder Reynolds analogy with $\\alpha_t(y) = \\nu_t(y)$ and $Pr = 1$ so that $\\alpha = \\nu$, the denominators in both gradients are the same:\n$$\\alpha + \\alpha_t(y) = \\nu + \\nu_t(y).$$\nTherefore,\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}y} = -\\frac{q_w}{\\rho c_p}\\,\\frac{1}{\\nu + \\nu_t(y)}, \\qquad \\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{u_{\\ast}^{2}}{\\,\\nu + \\nu_t(y)\\,}.$$\n\nWe now convert these gradients to derivatives with respect to the inner coordinate $y^{+} = y\\,u_{\\ast}/\\nu$.

Recovery factor $r$ for an adiabatic wall when $Pr = 1$.\n\nWe now consider the adiabatic-wall case ($q_w = 0$) and focus on the transport of total enthalpy\n$$h_0(y) \\equiv c_p T(y) + \\frac{u^{2}(y)}{2}.$$\nThe steady Reynolds-averaged energy equation for a constant-property, calorically perfect gas in a two-dimensional boundary layer with negligible streamwise diffusion and pressure work can be written as\n$$\\rho u\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(c_p T\\right) + \\rho v\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(c_p T\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left[k_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right] + \\Phi,$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k + k_t = \\rho c_p\\left(\\alpha + \\alpha_t\\right)$ is the effective thermal conductivity and $\\Phi$ is the mean viscous dissipation, which within the boundary layer is dominated by shear and can be modeled in terms of the effective viscosity $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\rho\\left(\\nu + \\nu_t\\right)$ as\n$$\\Phi \\approx \\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right)^{2}.$$\n\nTo expose the transport of $h_0$, we combine the energy equation with the momentum equation expressed in terms of the effective viscosity. The mean streamwise momentum equation under boundary-layer approximations yields\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left[\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right] \\approx \\rho u\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\rho v\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}.$$\nMultiplying this by $u$ and adding it to the energy equation, we obtain an equation for $h_0$:\n$$\\rho u\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{u^{2}}{2} + c_p T\\right) + \\rho v\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{u^{2}}{2} + c_p T\\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left[\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,u\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\rho c_p\\left(\\alpha + \\alpha_t\\right)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right] + \\Phi - \\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right)^{2}.$$\nNoting that $\\Phi \\approx \\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\left(\\partial u/\\partial y\\right)^{2}$, the dissipation terms cancel, leaving\n$$\\rho u\\,\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial x} + \\rho v\\,\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left[\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,u\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\rho c_p\\left(\\alpha + \\alpha_t\\right)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right].$$\nWe rewrite the right-hand side using the product rule:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,u\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\rho\\left(\\nu + \\nu_t\\right)\\,u\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\rho\\left(\\nu + \\nu_t\\right)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{u^{2}}{2}\\right),$$\nand\n$$\\rho c_p\\left(\\alpha + \\alpha_t\\right)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\rho\\left(\\nu + \\nu_t\\right)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(c_p T\\right) \\quad \\text{when } Pr = 1 \\text{ and } \\alpha_t = \\nu_t.$$\nThus, under $Pr = 1$ and Reynolds analogy, the bracket on the right-hand side becomes\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\,u\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} + \\rho c_p\\left(\\alpha + \\alpha_t\\right)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = \\rho\\left(\\nu + \\nu_t\\right)\\,\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{u^{2}}{2} + c_p T\\right) = \\rho\\left(\\nu + \\nu_t\\right)\\,\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y}.$$\nTherefore, the transport equation for $h_0$ reduces to\n$$\\rho u\\,\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial x} + \\rho v\\,\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left[\\rho\\left(\\nu + \\nu_t\\right)\\,\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y}\\right].$$\n\nIn the case of a spatially uniform free stream (no streamwise variation of edge conditions) and a statistically steady boundary layer, $\\partial h_0/\\partial x$ within the inner region is negligible compared to wall-normal diffusion and convection. At an adiabatic wall, the wall-normal conductive heat flux vanishes, $q_w = 0$, and the net wall-normal diffusive flux of $h_0$ must also vanish at the wall to satisfy the boundary condition on total enthalpy transport. With the effective diffusivity of $h_0$ given by $\\rho\\left(\\nu + \\nu_t\\right)$ under $Pr = 1$, the only consistent solution matching the uniform edge value $h_{0,e} = c_p T_e + U_e^{2}/2$ and zero diffusive flux at the wall is\n$$\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} = 0 \\quad \\text{throughout the boundary layer},$$\nso that\n$$h_0(y) \\equiv c_p T(y) + \\frac{u^{2}(y)}{2} = h_{0,e} = c_p T_e + \\frac{U_e^{2}}{2}.$$\nEvaluating at the wall (where $u \\to 0$),\n$$c_p T_{aw} + \\frac{0^{2}}{2} = c_p T_e + \\frac{U_e^{2}}{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad T_{aw} = T_e + \\frac{U_e^{2}}{2 c_p} = T_0.$$\nThus, the adiabatic wall temperature equals the free-stream stagnation temperature, and the recovery factor is\n$$r = \\frac{T_{aw} - T_e}{T_0 - T_e} = \\frac{T_0 - T_e}{T_0 - T_e} = 1.$$\n\nThe step where $Pr = 1$ is essential is the identification of the effective diffusivity of static enthalpy with that of momentum (and hence of kinetic energy) so that the combined diffusive flux of $h_0$ can be written in terms of a single effective diffusivity multiplying $\\partial h_0/\\partial y$. This equality ensures that $h_0$ is transported without distortion across the boundary layer under adiabatic conditions, yielding $T_{aw} = T_0$ and $r = 1$.\n\nTherefore, under Reynolds analogy with $\\alpha_t = \\nu_t$ and $Pr = 1$, we have $T^{+}(y^{+}) = u^{+}(y^{+})$ in the inner region for non-adiabatic walls with uniform $q_w$, and, for adiabatic walls, the recovery factor evaluates to $r = 1$.",

We can express the time-dependent wall shear stress $\\tau_w(t)$, wall heat flux $q_w(t)$, skin-friction coefficient $C_f(t)$, and Stanton number $St(t)$ as a sum of a mean component (denoted by an overbar) and a small, time-varying perturbation (denoted by a prime):\n$$ \\tau_w(t) = \\overline{\\tau}_w + \\tau'_w(t) $$\n$$ q_w(t) = \\overline{q}_w + q'_w(t) $$\nThe dimensionless numbers are defined as:\n$$ C_f(t) = \\frac{2\\,\\tau_w(t)}{\\rho\\,U_{\\infty}^{2}} = \\overline{C}_f + C'_f(t) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad C'_f(t) = \\frac{2\\,\\tau'_w(t)}{\\rho\\,U_{\\infty}^{2}} $$\n$$ St(t) = \\frac{q_w(t)}{\\rho\\,c_p\\,U_{\\infty}\\,\\Delta T} = \\overline{St} + St'(t) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad St'(t) = \\frac{q'_w(t)}{\\rho\\,c_p\\,U_{\\infty}\\,\\Delta T} $$\nThe forcing is a harmonic perturbation in the wall shear stress:\n$$ \\tau'_w(t) = \\tilde{\\tau}\\,\\cos(\\omega t) $$\nwhere $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency. It is convenient to use complex notation, where the physical quantity is the real part of a complex variable:\n$$ \\tau'_w(t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\hat{\\tau}_w e^{i \\omega t}\\} $$\nwith the complex amplitude $\\hat{\\tau}_w = \\tilde{\\tau}$ being a real number in this case. We seek a fluctuating heat flux of the form $q'_w(t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\hat{q}_w e^{i \\omega t}\\}$, where $\\hat{q}_w$ is the complex amplitude of the heat flux perturbation.\n\nThe core of the model is the Maxwell-Cattaneo-type relaxation equation for the turbulent heat flux, which for perturbations at the wall ($y=0$), is given by:\n$$ \\tau_h\\,\\frac{d q'_w}{dt} + q'_w = -\\rho\\,c_p\\,\\alpha_t\\,\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right)'_{y=0}(t) $$\nHere, we have used the assumption that $q_w(t) \\approx q_t|_{y=0}$, and we have subtracted the mean-state equation to obtain the equation for the perturbations.\n\nThe third assumption provides a closure for the term on the right-hand side. It states that the near-wall thermal gradient perturbation is proportional to the wall shear stress perturbation:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\right)'_{y=0}(t) = -K\\,\\tau'_w(t) $$\nwhere $K$ is a positive constant of proportionality. The negative sign ensures that for a positive shear stress perturbation (implying stronger mixing), the temperature gradient near the heated wall becomes more negative (steeper profile, enhanced heat transfer). The exact value of $K$, which depends on $Pr_t$ and mean flow properties, is not needed to find the phase.\n\nSubstituting this relationship into the relaxation equation gives a first-order linear ordinary differential equation relating the output $q'_w(t)$ to the input $\\tau'_w(t)$:\n$$ \\tau_h\\,\\frac{d q'_w}{dt} + q'_w = -\\rho\\,c_p\\,\\alpha_t\\,(-K\\,\\tau'_w(t)) = K\\,\\rho\\,c_p\\,\\alpha_t\\,\\tau'_w(t) $$\n\nTo find the frequency-domain relationship, we substitute the complex forms for the perturbations into this differential equation. The time derivative $\\frac{d}{dt}$ becomes multiplication by $i\\omega$:\n$$ \\tau_h (i\\omega \\hat{q}_w e^{i\\omega t}) + (\\hat{q}_w e^{i\\omega t}) = K\\,\\rho\\,c_p\\,\\alpha_t\\,(\\hat{\\tau}_w e^{i\\omega t}) $$\nDividing by $e^{i\\omega t}$, we get an algebraic equation for the complex amplitudes:\n$$ (1 + i\\omega\\tau_h) \\hat{q}_w = K\\,\\rho\\,c_p\\,\\alpha_t\\,\\hat{\\tau}_w $$\nSolving for $\\hat{q}_w$:\n$$ \\hat{q}_w = \\frac{K\\,\\rho\\,c_p\\,\\alpha_t}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_h}\\,\\hat{\\tau}_w $$\nThis equation relates the complex amplitudes of the physical heat flux and shear stress. Now, we convert to the dimensionless Stanton and skin-friction numbers. The complex amplitudes of their perturbations are:\n$$ \\hat{C}_f = \\frac{2\\,\\hat{\\tau}_w}{\\rho\\,U_{\\infty}^{2}} \\implies \\hat{\\tau}_w = \\frac{\\rho\\,U_{\\infty}^{2}}{2}\\,\\hat{C}_f $$\n$$ \\hat{St} = \\frac{\\hat{q}_w}{\\rho\\,c_p\\,U_{\\infty}\\,\\Delta T} \\implies \\hat{q}_w = \\rho\\,c_p\\,U_{\\infty}\\,\\Delta T\\,\\hat{St} $$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\hat{q}_w$:\n$$ \\rho\\,c_p\\,U_{\\infty}\\,\\Delta T\\,\\hat{St} = \\frac{K\\,\\rho\\,c_p\\,\\alpha_t}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_h} \\left( \\frac{\\rho\\,U_{\\infty}^{2}}{2}\\,\\hat{C}_f \\right) $$\nWe can now find the transfer function $H(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{St}}{\\hat{C}_f}$:\n$$ H(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{St}}{\\hat{C}_f} = \\left(\\frac{K\\,\\rho\\,\\alpha_t\\,U_{\\infty}}{2\\,\\Delta T}\\right) \\frac{1}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_h} $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is a real-valued constant. The phase shift, $\\phi$, of $St(t)$ relative to $C_f(t)$ is given by the argument of the complex transfer function $H(\\omega)$:\n$$ \\phi = \\arg(H(\\omega)) = \\arg\\left(\\frac{K\\,\\rho\\,\\alpha_t\\,U_{\\infty}}{2\\,\\Delta T}\\right) + \\arg\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + i\\omega\\tau_h}\\right) $$\nSince the first term is real and positive, its argument is zero.\n$$ \\phi = \\arg(1) - \\arg(1 + i\\omega\\tau_h) = 0 - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega\\tau_h}{1}\\right) $$\n$$ \\phi = -\\arctan(\\omega\\tau_h) $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the Stanton number oscillations lag behind the skin-friction oscillations. The phase lag is the magnitude of this phase shift, which is a positive quantity:\n$$ \\text{Phase Lag} = |\\phi| = \\arctan(\\omega\\tau_h) $$\nThe phase lag is expressed in terms of the relaxation time $\\tau_h$ and the forcing frequency $f$ via $\\omega = 2\\pi f$:\n$$ \\text{Phase Lag} = \\arctan(2\\pi f \\tau_h) $$\nWe are given the values $\\tau_h = 8.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ s and $f = 40$ Hz. We can now compute the phase lag in radians.\n$$ 2\\pi f \\tau_h = 2\\pi (40) (8.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 2\\pi (0.32) = 0.64\\pi $$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$ 2\\pi f \\tau_h \\approx 2 \\times 3.14159265 \\times 0.32 \\approx 2.010619 $$\nThe phase lag is then:\n$$ \\text{Phase Lag} = \\arctan(2.010619) \\approx 1.109144 \\text{ radians} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.109$ radians.",
