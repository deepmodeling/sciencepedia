The concepts of local equilibrium and homogeneous shear are common idealizations used for analyzing turbulence models. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and constraints to derive a unique analytical expression. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a formalizable and relevant problem in computational thermal engineering, free from contradictions, and its solution requires a non-trivial application of fundamental principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution follows.\n\nThe derivation begins by systematically combining the given definitions and assumptions.\n\nThe definition of the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$ is given as:\n$$\n\\rho\\,u_{\\tau}^{2} = \\tau_{xy}\n$$\nThe problem states that the total shear stress $\\tau_{xy}$ is equal to the turbulent shear stress, which is modeled using the Boussinesq hypothesis with the turbulent kinematic viscosity $\\nu_t$ and the mean shear $S$:\n$$\n\\tau_{xy} = \\rho\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S\n$$\nCombining these two equations gives a relationship between $u_{\\tau}$, $\\nu_t$, and $S$:\n$$\n\\rho\\,u_{\\tau}^{2} = \\rho\\,\\nu_{t}\\,S\n$$\nDividing by the density $\\rho$ (which is non-zero) yields:\n$$\nu_{\\tau}^{2} = \\nu_{t}\\,S \\quad \\quad (1)\n$$\nThe problem requires using the fundamental kinematic definition for the production of turbulent kinetic energy, $P$. For a planar shear flow with mean velocity $U(y)$, the production term is given by:\n$$\nP = -\\overline{u'v'} \\frac{dU}{dy}\n$$\nwhere $-\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v'}$ is the Reynolds shear stress. The Boussinesq hypothesis relates this stress to the mean strain rate: $-\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v'} = \\rho\\,\\nu_{t}\\,\\frac{dU}{dy}$.

We can rearrange it to express $\\nu_t$ as:\n$$\n\\nu_{t} = \\frac{u_{\\tau}^{4}}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nNow, we equate this expression for $\\nu_t$ with the model definition for $\\nu_t$ from equation (3):\n$$\n\\frac{u_{\\tau}^{4}}{\\epsilon} = C_{\\mu}\\,\\frac{k^{2}}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe dissipation rate $\\epsilon$ is non-zero in a turbulent flow, so we can cancel it from both sides:\n$$\nu_{\\tau}^{4} = C_{\\mu}\\,k^{2}\n$$\nTo find $u_{\\tau}$, we take the fourth root of both sides. Since $u_{\\tau}$ represents a velocity scale and $k$ (kinetic energy) is non-negative, we consider the positive real root:\n$$\nu_{\\tau} = (C_{\\mu}\\,k^{2})^{1/4} = C_{\\mu}^{1/4}\\,(k^2)^{1/4} = C_{\\mu}^{1/4}\\,k^{1/2}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$ in terms of the turbulent kinetic energy $k$ and the model constant $C_{\\mu}$.\n\nFor the physical interpretation of $C_{\\mu}$, we can rearrange the intermediate result $u_{\\tau}^{4} = C_{\\mu}\\,k^{2}$ by taking the square root:\n$$\nu_{\\tau}^{2} = \\sqrt{C_{\\mu}}\\,k\n$$\nRecalling that $\\tau_{xy} = \\rho\\,u_{\\tau}^{2}$ and that $\\tau_{xy}$ is the magnitude of the Reynolds shear stress $-\\rho\\,\\overline{u'v'}$ in this high Reynolds number flow, we can write:\n$$\n\\left|-\\overline{u'v'}\\right| = \\sqrt{C_{\\mu}}\\,k\n$$\nThis can be expressed as a ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\left|-\\overline{u'v'}\\right|}{k} = \\sqrt{C_{\\mu}}\n$$\nThe ratio of the Reynolds shear stress to the turbulent kinetic energy, $\\left|-\\overline{u'v'}\\right|/k$, is a key structural parameter of turbulent shear flows. It quantifies the anisotropy of the Reynolds stress tensor and the efficiency of the turbulence in transporting momentum. The derivation shows that in a state of local equilibrium, this ratio is not an independent flow variable but is instead a constant determined solely by the model parameter $C_{\\mu}$. Thus, $C_{\\mu}$ is a fundamental constant of the $k$-$\\epsilon$ model that sets the level of shear stress generated by a given amount of turbulent kinetic energy in equilibrium shear flows. The standard empirical value $C_{\\mu} \\approx 0.09$ corresponds to the experimentally observed value of $\\left|-\\overline{u'v'}\\right|/k \\approx 0.3$ in such flows. In the context of the derived expression $u_{\\tau} = C_{\\mu}^{1/4}\\,k^{1/2}$, the term $C_{\\mu}^{1/4}$ acts as the constant of proportionality that links two characteristic velocity scales: the friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$ (a scale for turbulent momentum transfer) and the turbulent velocity fluctuation scale $\\sqrt{k}$.",

We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nWe are asked to characterize the evolution of the ratio $r(t) = \\epsilon(t)/k(t)$. We begin by finding its time derivative using the quotient rule:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{ d }{ dt } \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon}{k} \\right) = \\frac{k \\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} - \\epsilon \\frac{dk}{dt}}{k^2} $$\nNext, we substitute the provided governing equations for $\\frac{dk}{dt}$ and $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt}$ into this expression. First, let's incorporate the production relation $P(t) = \\alpha\\,\\epsilon(t)$ into the governing equations:\n$$ \\frac{dk}{dt} = \\alpha\\epsilon - \\epsilon = (\\alpha - 1)\\epsilon $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = C_{\\epsilon1}\\,\\frac{\\epsilon}{k}\\,(\\alpha\\epsilon) - C_{\\epsilon2}\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k} = (C_{\\epsilon1}\\alpha - C_{\\epsilon2})\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{k} $$\nNow we substitute these simplified derivatives into the expression for $\\frac{dr}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{k \\left( (C_{\\epsilon1}\\alpha - C_{\\epsilon2})\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{k} \\right) - \\epsilon \\left( (\\alpha - 1)\\epsilon \\right)}{k^2} $$\nSimplifying the terms in the numerator:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{(C_{\\epsilon1}\\alpha - C_{\\epsilon2})\\epsilon^2 - (\\alpha - 1)\\epsilon^2}{k^2} $$\nWe can factor out $\\epsilon^2$ from the numerator:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\frac{(C_{\\epsilon1}\\alpha - C_{\\epsilon2} - \\alpha + 1)\\epsilon^2}{k^2} $$\nRecognizing that $r^2 = (\\epsilon/k)^2$, we can rewrite the equation in terms of $r$:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = (C_{\\epsilon1}\\alpha - C_{\\epsilon2} - \\alpha + 1)r^2 $$\nThe problem asks us to investigate the specific case where $C_{\\epsilon1} = C_{\\epsilon2}$. Substituting this condition into the differential equation for $r(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = (C_{\\epsilon2}\\alpha - C_{\\epsilon2} - \\alpha + 1)r^2 $$\nWe can factor the coefficient on the right-hand side by grouping terms:\n$$ C_{\\epsilon2}\\alpha - C_{\\epsilon2} - \\alpha + 1 = C_{\\epsilon2}(\\alpha - 1) - (\\alpha - 1) = (C_{\\epsilon2} - 1)(\\alpha - 1) $$\nThus, the evolution of $r(t)$ is governed by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = (C_{\\epsilon2} - 1)(\\alpha - 1) r^2 $$\nLet's analyze this equation for the specified condition $\\alpha \\ge 1$.\n\n**Case 1: $\\alpha = 1$**\nIf $\\alpha = 1$, the right-hand side becomes zero:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = (C_{\\epsilon2} - 1)(1 - 1) r^2 = 0 $$\nThis implies that $r(t)$ is a constant, $r(t) = r(0) = \\epsilon_{0}/k_{0}$.\nLet's examine the evolution of $k(t)$ and $\\epsilon(t)$ in this case.\n$\\frac{dk}{dt} = (\\alpha - 1)\\epsilon = (1 - 1)\\epsilon = 0$, which means $k(t) = k_{0}$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nSimilarly, $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = (C_{\\epsilon1}\\alpha - C_{\\epsilon2})\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{k} = (C_{\\epsilon2}(1) - C_{\\epsilon2})\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{k} = 0$, which means $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_{0}$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThe turbulent kinetic energy $k$ and its dissipation rate $\\epsilon$ remain constant. This represents a state of non-decaying turbulence. Physically, for a situation where production equals dissipation ($P=\\epsilon$, i.e., $\\alpha=1$), the flow is in equilibrium. However, for a generic initial state in a decaying turbulent field, one expects $k$ and $\\epsilon$ to decrease over time. The model's prediction of a static state is non-physical for a system that should be dynamically evolving towards decay, thus demonstrating its incompatibility with physically acceptable decay.\n\n**Case 2: $\\alpha  1$**\nIn this case, the term $(\\alpha - 1)$ is positive. The standard value of $C_{\\epsilon2}$ is derived from experiments on decaying grid turbulence and is found to be approximately $1.92$. This value is greater than $1$. Assuming $C_{\\epsilon2}  1$, the term $(C_{\\epsilon2} - 1)$ is also positive.\nLet's define a positive constant $\\beta = (C_{\\epsilon2} - 1)(\\alpha - 1)  0$. The ODE for $r(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\beta r^2 $$\nThis is a standard ODE that leads to a finite-time singularity (or \"blow-up\"). We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{r^2} = \\beta dt $$\nWe integrate both sides, from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$, and from the initial ratio $r(0) = r_{0} = \\epsilon_{0}/k_{0}$ to $r(t)$:\n$$ \\int_{r_0}^{r(t)} \\frac{dr'}{(r')^2} = \\int_0^t \\beta dt' $$\n$$ \\left[ -\\frac{1}{r'} \\right]_{r_0}^{r(t)} = \\beta t $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{r(t)} + \\frac{1}{r_0} = \\beta t $$\nSolving for $r(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r(t)} = \\frac{1}{r_0} - \\beta t = \\frac{1 - r_0 \\beta t}{r_0} $$\n$$ r(t) = \\frac{r_0}{1 - r_0 \\beta t} $$\nThe ratio $r(t)$ will diverge to infinity as the denominator approaches zero. This explosive behavior is physically unrealistic for $k$ and $\\epsilon$, which are expected to decay, or at worst, grow polynomially in certain flows. This demonstrates the incompatibility of the choice $C_{\\epsilon1}=C_{\\epsilon2}$ with physical reality for $\\alpha1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the finite time $T^{\\ast}$ at which this divergence occurs. This happens when the denominator of the expression for $r(t)$ is zero:\n$$ 1 - r_0 \\beta T^{\\ast} = 0 $$\nSolving for $T^{\\ast}$:\n$$ T^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{r_0 \\beta} $$\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $r_0$ and $\\beta$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ r_0 = \\frac{\\epsilon_0}{k_0} $$\n$$ \\beta = (C_{\\epsilon2} - 1)(\\alpha - 1) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $T^{\\ast}$:\n$$ T^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_0}{k_0}\\right) (C_{\\epsilon2} - 1)(\\alpha - 1)} $$\n$$ T^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_0}{\\epsilon_0 (C_{\\epsilon2} - 1)(\\alpha - 1)} $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the finite time at which the ratio $r(t)$ diverges.",

The maximum allowable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is the upper limit of this inequality.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{k}{C_{\\epsilon 2}\\,\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe units of this expression are seconds, as $k$ has units of $\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2$ and $\\epsilon$ has units of $\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^3$, while $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ is dimensionless. Thus, $[k/\\epsilon] = (\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2) / (\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^3) = \\text{s}$.\n\n**Influence of $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ on Stiffness**\nNumerical stiffness in an ODE system arises when there are vastly different time scales governing the system's dynamics. For explicit integration methods like forward Euler, the time step must be smaller than the fastest time scale in the system to ensure numerical stability.\n\nThe characteristic time scale, $\\tau_{\\epsilon}$, of the destruction process for $\\epsilon$ can be estimated by dividing the quantity itself by its rate of change:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\epsilon} \\approx \\left| \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt}} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{\\epsilon}{-C_{\\epsilon 2}\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{k}} \\right| = \\frac{k}{C_{\\epsilon 2}\\,\\epsilon}\n$$\nWe observe that the stability limit we derived, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is precisely this characteristic time scale.\n\nThe influence of the constant $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ is now evident. The time scale $\\tau_{\\epsilon}$ is inversely proportional to $C_{\\epsilon 2}$.\n-   If $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ is large, the characteristic time scale $\\tau_{\\epsilon}$ becomes small. This indicates that the dissipation rate $\\epsilon$ decays very rapidly.\n-   For an explicit method to be stable, the time step $\\Delta t$ must resolve this fast decay, meaning $\\Delta t \\leq \\tau_{\\epsilon}$.\n-   Therefore, a larger value of $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ tightens the restriction on the time step, forcing the use of a smaller $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ to maintain stability and positivity.\n\nThis is the definition of increased stiffness for an explicit scheme: a larger coefficient on a high-order term (here, $\\epsilon^2$) forces a computationally expensive reduction in the time step. Thus, a larger magnitude of $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ makes the ODE stiffer with respect to explicit time integration.",
