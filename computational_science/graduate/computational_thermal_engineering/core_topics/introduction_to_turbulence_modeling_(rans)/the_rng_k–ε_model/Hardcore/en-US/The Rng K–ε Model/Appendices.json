            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is based on established principles of computational fluid dynamics, specifically Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) turbulence modeling. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, we justify the functional form of the turbulent kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$, using dimensional analysis. Second, we compute $\\nu_t$ for both the standard and RNG $k$–$\\epsilon$ models and then determine their fractional difference.\n\nThe Boussinesq hypothesis provides a linear relationship between the Reynolds stress tensor and the mean strain rate tensor, introducing the turbulent (or eddy) kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$. For high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows, the local state of turbulence can often be characterized by two parameters: the turbulent kinetic energy, $k$, and its rate of dissipation, $\\epsilon$. The quantity $k$ represents the energy contained in the turbulent fluctuations (per unit mass), and $\\epsilon$ represents the rate at which this energy is converted into thermal internal energy (per unit mass).\n\nWe seek to find a functional relationship for $\\nu_t$ based on $k$ and $\\epsilon$ through dimensional analysis. Let $[L]$, $[M]$, and $[T]$ represent the fundamental dimensions of length, mass, and time, respectively. The dimensions of the quantities of interest are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Turbulent kinematic viscosity, $\\nu_t$: This has the same dimensions as molecular kinematic viscosity, which is a diffusivity. $[\\nu_t] = L^2 T^{-1}$.\n    \\item Turbulent kinetic energy, $k$: This is energy per unit mass, which has dimensions of velocity squared. $[k] = (L T^{-1})^2 = L^2 T^{-2}$.\n    \\item Turbulent dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$: This is energy per unit mass per unit time, or $k$ per unit time. $[\\epsilon] = \\frac{[k]}{[T]} = \\frac{L^2 T^{-2}}{T} = L^2 T^{-3}$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe assume a power-law relationship of the form:\n$$ \\nu_t = C_\\mu k^a \\epsilon^b $$\nwhere $C_\\mu$ is a dimensionless proportionality constant, and $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined. Equating the dimensions on both sides of the equation:\n$$ [\\nu_t] = [k]^a [\\epsilon]^b $$\n$$ L^2 T^{-1} = (L^2 T^{-2})^a (L^2 T^{-3})^b $$\n$$ L^2 T^{-1} = L^{2a} T^{-2a} L^{2b} T^{-3b} $$\n$$ L^2 T^{-1} = L^{2a+2b} T^{-2a-3b} $$\n\nFor the equation to be dimensionally homogeneous, the exponents of each fundamental dimension must be equal on both sides. This yields a system of two linear equations for $a$ and $b$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item For dimension $L$: $2 = 2a + 2b \\implies 1 = a + b$\n    \\item For dimension $T$: $-1 = -2a - 3b \\implies 1 = 2a + 3b$\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nFrom equation (1), we express $b$ in terms of $a$: $b = 1 - a$.\nSubstituting this into equation (2):\n$$ 1 = 2a + 3(1 - a) $$\n$$ 1 = 2a + 3 - 3a $$\n$$ 1 = 3 - a $$\n$$ a = 2 $$\nNow, we find $b$:\n$$ b = 1 - a = 1 - 2 = -1 $$\nThus, the exponents are $a=2$ and $b=-1$.

The task requires a straightforward application of asymptotic analysis to a well-defined rational function, which is a standard mathematical procedure. All necessary information is provided for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the leading-order asymptotic expressions for the RNG term $R_{\\epsilon}$ in the limits of weak strain ($\\eta \\to 0$) and strong strain ($\\eta \\to \\infty$). The term is given by\n$$\nR_{\\epsilon} = C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k}\\, r(\\eta)\n$$\nwhere $r(\\eta)$ is a function of the dimensionless strain parameter $\\eta = \\frac{S\\,k}{\\epsilon}$.

We examine the leading-order behavior of the function $r(\\eta)$ as its argument approaches zero.\nFor the numerator of $r(\\eta)$, as $\\eta \\to 0$, the term $\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta_{0}}$ becomes negligible compared to $1$. Thus, the expression $(1 - \\frac{\\eta}{\\eta_{0}})$ approaches $1$. The numerator is asymptotically equivalent to $\\eta^{3}$.\n$$\n\\eta^{3}\\left(1 - \\frac{\\eta}{\\eta_{0}}\\right) \\sim \\eta^{3} \\quad \\text{as} \\quad \\eta \\to 0\n$$\nFor the denominator, as $\\eta \\to 0$, the term $\\beta\\,\\eta^{3}$ becomes negligible compared to $1$. The denominator approaches $1$.\n$$\n1 + \\beta\\,\\eta^{3} \\sim 1 \\quad \\text{as} \\quad \\eta \\to 0\n$$\nCombining these, the leading-order behavior of $r(\\eta)$ for small $\\eta$ is:\n$$\nr(\\eta) \\sim \\frac{\\eta^{3}}{1} = \\eta^{3}\n$$\nWe substitute this asymptotic form into the expression for $R_{\\epsilon}$ to find its leading-order behavior, denoted as $L_{0}$:\n$$\nL_{0} = R_{\\epsilon}|_{\\eta \\to 0} \\approx C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k}\\, (\\eta^{3})\n$$\nThe problem requires the final expression to be in terms of the primary flow variables, so we substitute the definition $\\eta = \\frac{S\\,k}{\\epsilon}$:\n$$\nL_{0} \\approx C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k}\\, \\left(\\frac{S\\,k}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{3} = C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k}\\, \\frac{S^{3}\\,k^{3}}{\\epsilon^{3}} = C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,S^{3}\\,k^{2}\\,\\epsilon^{-1}\n$$\nThus, the leading-order asymptotic expression for $R_{\\epsilon}$ as $\\eta \\to 0$ is:\n$$\nL_{0} = C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{S^{3} k^{2}}{\\epsilon}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the limit of strong mean strain, which corresponds to $\\eta \\to \\infty$. We examine the leading-order behavior of the rational function $r(\\eta)$ as its argument becomes very large. To do this, we identify the highest power of $\\eta$ in the numerator and the denominator.\nThe numerator is $\\eta^{3} - \\frac{\\eta^{4}}{\\eta_{0}}$. For large $\\eta$, the term $-\\frac{\\eta^{4}}{\\eta_{0}}$ dominates.\nThe denominator is $1 + \\beta\\,\\eta^{3}$. For large $\\eta$, the term $\\beta\\,\\eta^{3}$ dominates.\nSo, the asymptotic behavior of $r(\\eta)$ for large $\\eta$ is the ratio of these dominant terms:\n$$\nr(\\eta) \\sim \\frac{-\\frac{\\eta^{4}}{\\eta_{0}}}{\\beta\\,\\eta^{3}} = -\\frac{\\eta}{\\beta\\,\\eta_{0}} \\quad \\text{as} \\quad \\eta \\to \\infty\n$$\nWe substitute this asymptotic form into the expression for $R_{\\epsilon}$ to find its leading-order behavior, denoted as $L_{\\infty}$:\n$$\nL_{\\infty} = R_{\\epsilon}|_{\\eta \\to \\infty} \\approx C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k}\\, \\left(-\\frac{\\eta}{\\beta\\,\\eta_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nAgain, substituting $\\eta = \\frac{S\\,k}{\\epsilon}$:\n$$\nL_{\\infty} \\approx C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{k}\\, \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\beta\\,\\eta_{0}}\\frac{S\\,k}{\\epsilon}\\right) = -\\frac{C_{\\mu}}{\\beta\\,\\eta_{0}}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}\\,S\\,k}{k\\,\\epsilon} = -\\frac{C_{\\mu}}{\\beta\\,\\eta_{0}}\\,\\rho\\,S\\,\\epsilon\n$$\nThus, the leading-order asymptotic expression for $R_{\\epsilon}$ as $\\eta \\to \\infty$ is:\n$$\nL_{\\infty} = -\\frac{C_{\\mu}}{\\beta\\,\\eta_{0}}\\,\\rho\\,S\\,\\epsilon\n$$\n\nFinally, we discuss the physical implications of these limits. The term $R_{\\epsilon}$ typically appears in the dissipation rate transport equation with a negative sign, as in $\\frac{D\\epsilon}{Dt} = \\dots - R_{\\epsilon}$.\n\nIn the limit of weak strain ($\\eta \\to 0$), $L_0$ is positive since all its constituent variables and constants ($C_{\\mu}, \\rho, S, k, \\epsilon$) are non-negative. This means the term $-R_{\\epsilon}$ becomes a sink (destruction) term in the $\\epsilon$ equation, representing additional destruction. However, since the term's magnitude diminishes rapidly with the strain rate (proportional to $S^3$), its effect becomes negligible in regions of very weak or zero strain, ensuring the model's behavior converges toward that of the standard model in those limits.\n\nIn the limit of strong strain ($\\eta \\to \\infty$), $L_{\\infty}$ is negative. Consequently, the term $-R_{\\epsilon}$ becomes a source (production) term for $\\epsilon$. This increased production of $\\epsilon$ leads to a faster dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. The turbulent viscosity, $\\mu_t = C_{\\mu}\\,\\rho\\,\\frac{k^{2}}{\\epsilon}$, is consequently reduced. This is a key feature of the RNG model: it systematically reduces the turbulent viscosity in regions of high strain rate, thereby correcting the tendency of the standard $k$-$\\epsilon$ model to over-predict turbulent mixing in such regions.",

The ratio $k/\\epsilon$ has units of time and represents the turnover time of the large, energy-containing eddies.\n$$ \\tau_t = \\frac{k}{\\epsilon} $$\n- The characteristic time scale of the mean flow strain, $\\tau_s$, is the inverse of the mean-strain magnitude, $S$. The quantity $S$ has units of $[\\text{time}]^{-1}$ (e.g., $\\text{s}^{-1}$).\n$$ \\tau_s = \\frac{1}{S} $$\n- The dimensionless parameter $\\eta$ is the ratio of these two time scales, quantifying the effect of the mean strain rate on the turbulence.\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{\\tau_t}{\\tau_s} = \\frac{k/\\epsilon}{1/S} $$\nThis simplifies to the standard definition:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{Sk}{\\epsilon} $$\n\n**2. Functional Form of the Additional Dissipation Term**\n\nThe standard transport equation for $\\epsilon$ in many $k$–$\\epsilon$ models includes production and destruction terms. The RNG $k$–$\\epsilon$ model, as derived by Yakhot and Orszag, introduces an additional term, $R_\\epsilon$, in the $\\epsilon$ equation to account for the effects of mean strain on the dissipation process. This term is what makes the model more accurate for flows with high strain rates, such as those with strong streamline curvature or separation.\n\nThe standard form of this additional term is given by:\n$$ R_{\\epsilon} = \\frac{C_{\\mu} \\rho \\eta^3 (1 - \\eta/\\eta_0)}{1 + \\beta \\eta^3} \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{k} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, and $C_{\\mu}$, $\\eta_0$, and $\\beta$ are model constants.\n\nThe problem asks for the normalized functional form $R_{\\epsilon}/(\\rho\\,\\epsilon^{2}/k)$. We can obtain this by dividing the expression for $R_{\\epsilon}$ by the factor $\\rho\\,\\epsilon^{2}/k$.\n$$ \\frac{R_{\\epsilon}}{\\rho\\,\\epsilon^{2}/k} = \\frac{C_{\\mu} \\eta^3 (1 - \\eta/\\eta_0)}{1 + \\beta \\eta^3} $$\nThis is the required functional form in terms of $\\eta$.\n\n**3.

The negative sign of the normalized term indicates that for this high-strain condition ($\\eta \\gg \\eta_0$), the term $R_\\epsilon$ is itself negative. Since this term appears as $-R_\\epsilon$ in the dissipation transport equation, it acts as a **source** (production) term for $\\epsilon$. The resulting increase in $\\epsilon$ leads to a **reduction** in the turbulent viscosity ($\\mu_t \\propto k^2/\\epsilon$). This is the key mechanism by which the RNG model correctly dampens turbulent mixing in regions of high strain rate, improving its predictive accuracy over the standard $k$–$\\epsilon$ model.",
