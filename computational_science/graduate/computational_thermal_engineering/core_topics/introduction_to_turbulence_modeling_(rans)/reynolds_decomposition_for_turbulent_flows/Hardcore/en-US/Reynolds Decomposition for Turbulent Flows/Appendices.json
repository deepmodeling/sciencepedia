            "solution": "We begin by applying the Reynolds decomposition to the velocity field. For a turbulent flow, the instantaneous velocity component $u_i$ is decomposed into a mean component $\\overline{u_i}$ and a fluctuating component $u_i'$, such that $u_i = \\overline{u_i} + u_i'$. For the given plane shear flow, the mean velocity field is $\\overline{\\mathbf{u}} = (U(y), 0, 0)$, where $U(y) = Sy$.\n\nThe Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations for an incompressible fluid with constant properties are given by:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u_i}}{\\partial t} + \\rho \\overline{u_j} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u_i}}{\\partial x_j} = -\\frac{\\partial \\overline{p}}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( \\mu \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u_i}}{\\partial x_j} - \\rho \\overline{u_i' u_j'} \\right)\n$$\nThe term $\\tau_{ij}^R = -\\rho \\overline{u_i' u_j'}$ is the Reynolds stress tensor, representing the effect of turbulent fluctuations on the mean flow.\n\nFor a statistically stationary flow, all time derivatives of mean quantities are zero ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$). For a plane shear flow with $\\overline{\\mathbf{u}} = (U(y), 0, 0)$, the mean momentum equation in the streamwise ($x$) direction simplifies significantly. Assuming homogeneity in the $x$ and $z$ directions for mean quantities (a standard assumption for such flows), the equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{d \\overline{p}}{dx} + \\frac{d}{dy} \\left( \\mu \\frac{dU}{dy} - \\rho \\overline{u'v'} \\right)\n$$\nThe total shear stress in the flow, $\\tau_{total}$, is the sum of the mean viscous stress, $\\tau_{yx}^{visc} = \\mu \\frac{dU}{dy}$, and the turbulent shear stress (also known as Reynolds shear stress), $\\tau_{yx}^{turb} = -\\rho \\overline{u'v'}$.\nSo, $\\tau_{total} = \\tau_{yx}^{visc} + \\tau_{yx}^{turb} = \\mu \\frac{dU}{dy} - \\rho \\overline{u'v'}$.\n\nThe problem requires us to model the turbulent shear stress term.

The process involves Reynolds averaging, modeling the resulting turbulent flux term, and evaluating the final expression with the provided data.\n\nFirst, we begin with the instantaneous scalar transport equation for temperature, $T$, in an incompressible flow with constant thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$.
