The goal is to resolve the viscous sublayer without using wall functions.\n\n1.  **First Wall-Normal Cell Position ($y_{1}^{+}$)**: The problem specifies a \"wall-resolved\" simulation. The SST $k$–$\\omega$ model, being an $\\omega$-based model, requires the resolution of the viscous sublayer ($y^{+} \\lesssim 5$) to behave correctly near the wall. The standard best practice to achieve this is to place the first computational cell center at $y_{1}^{+} \\leq 1$. This ensures the steep gradients within the sublayer are captured accurately.\n    -   Options A and D meet this criterion ($y_{1}^{+} \\leq 1$).\n    -   Option B ($30 \\leq y_{1}^{+} \\leq 300$) is for wall-function approaches and is incorrect for this problem.\n    -   Option C ($y_{1}^{+} \\leq 5$) is insufficient, as placing the cell center at the edge of the sublayer does not properly resolve it.\n\n2.  **Wall-Parallel Spacing ($\\Delta x^{+}$, $\\Delta z^{+}$)**: For RANS simulations, the mesh does not need to resolve turbulent eddies, but it should be fine enough to accurately compute the mean flow gradients. Established guidelines for achieving grid-independent wall quantities (shear stress, heat flux) suggest a streamwise spacing of $\\Delta x^{+} \\lesssim 100-150$ and a spanwise spacing of $\\Delta z^{+} \\lesssim 30-60$.\n    -   Option A ($\\Delta x^{+} \\leq 100$, $\\Delta z^{+} \\leq 50$) fits these standard guidelines perfectly.\n    -   Option D ($\\Delta x^{+} \\leq 50$, $\\Delta z^{+} \\leq 20$) represents a much finer mesh, which, while accurate, likely constitutes \"unnecessary over-resolution\" for a RANS calculation.\n\n3.  **Wall-Normal Growth Factor ($r_{y}$)**: To maintain numerical accuracy and avoid large truncation errors, the grid spacing should expand smoothly away from the wall. A growth factor of $r_{y} \\leq 1.2$ is widely considered a good practice.\n    -   Option A ($r_{y} \\leq 1.2$) and Option D ($r_{y} \\leq 1.1$) both satisfy this, with Option A being the less restrictive standard.\n    -   Options B ($r_{y} \\leq 1.4$) and C ($r_{y} \\leq 1.3$) propose growth factors that are too aggressive for a high-quality simulation.\n\n4.  **Number of Wall-Normal Points**: Resolving the entire boundary layer structure (viscous sublayer, buffer layer, log-law region, and wake) requires a sufficient number of points. A minimum of 10 or 15 points (Options B, C) is inadequate. A range of 30-50 points is typically considered a reasonable minimum.\n    -   Option A (at least 30 points) and Option D (at least 40 points) both provide a sufficient number of points.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n-   **Option A** provides a complete set of meshing criteria that are consistent with established best practices for a wall-resolved SST $k$–$\\omega$ simulation. It balances the need for accuracy with computational efficiency, meeting the problem's requirement for the \"smallest set of grid-spacing criteria... without unnecessary over-resolution.\"\n-   **Option B** is fundamentally incorrect as it describes a wall-function mesh.\n-   **Option C** uses criteria that are too coarse and would likely not lead to grid-independent results.\n-   **Option D** describes a very high-quality, conservative mesh that would be more expensive than necessary for the stated RANS goal, thus representing \"unnecessary over-resolution.\"\n\nTherefore, Option A represents the most appropriate choice.",
