            "problem": "Consider the two-dimensional, steady, incompressible, laminar boundary layer that forms over a semi-infinite flat plate aligned with a uniform free-stream velocity $U_{\\infty}$. Starting from the conservation of mass and momentum for boundary-layer flow, the governing equations are the continuity equation $\\partial u / \\partial x + \\partial v / \\partial y = 0$ and the streamwise momentum equation $u \\, \\partial u / \\partial x + v \\, \\partial u / \\partial y = \\nu \\, \\partial^2 u / \\partial y^2$, where $u(x,y)$ and $v(x,y)$ are the velocity components in the streamwise and wall-normal directions, respectively, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. Seeking a similarity solution with a streamfunction representation and a properly scaled similarity variable reduces the partial differential equations to the classical Blasius ordinary differential equation (ODE) for a dimensionless streamfunction profile $f(\\eta)$,\n$$\nf'''(\\eta) + \\tfrac{1}{2} f(\\eta) \\, f''(\\eta) = 0,\n$$\nwith boundary conditions\n$$\nf(0) = 0, \\quad f'(0) = 0, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f'(\\eta \\to \\infty) = 1,\n$$\nwhere primes denote differentiation with respect to the similarity variable $\\eta$. The quantity of interest is the unknown initial curvature $f''(0)$, which determines the wall shear stress and is a dimensionless number.\n\nYour task is to implement a numerical shooting method to solve the above initial value problem (IVP) and determine $f''(0)$ to at least four significant figures. Treat $s = f''(0)$ as a shooting parameter. For any trial $s$, integrate the Blasius ODE as a first-order system from $\\eta = 0$ to a finite truncation $\\eta = L$ using a modern adaptive ODE solver. Define the residual\n$$\nR(s; L) = f'(\\eta = L; s) - 1,\n$$\nand find $s$ such that $R(s; L) = 0$. Compare your computed $s$ against the classical reference value $s_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0.332057336215$ and assess whether the result has at least four significant figures correct. For this assessment, declare a pass if the absolute error $|s - s_{\\mathrm{ref}}| \\le 0.00005$, which guarantees correct rounding to four significant figures for a value near $s_{\\mathrm{ref}}$.\n\nThe solution must be purely algorithmic and dimensionless. Implement your solver in a single program that produces the required outputs without any external input. Use an adaptive ODE integrator from a standard scientific library to handle the IVP accurately. You may use a one-dimensional root-finding method such as bisection or secant for the shooting parameter.\n\nTest Suite:\nProvide results for the following parameter sets $(L, \\mathrm{rtol}, \\mathrm{atol})$, where $L$ is the finite truncation in the similarity variable and $\\mathrm{rtol}$ and $\\mathrm{atol}$ are the relative and absolute tolerances of the ODE solver, respectively. All quantities are dimensionless.\n\n- Case $1$: $(L, \\mathrm{rtol}, \\mathrm{atol}) = (10.0, 10^{-9}, 10^{-11})$.\n- Case $2$: $(L, \\mathrm{rtol}, \\mathrm{atol}) = (4.0, 10^{-8}, 10^{-10})$.\n- Case $3$: $(L, \\mathrm{rtol}, \\mathrm{atol}) = (20.0, 10^{-8}, 10^{-10})$.\n- Case $4$: $(L, \\mathrm{rtol}, \\mathrm{atol}) = (10.0, 10^{-6}, 10^{-8})$.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each element corresponds to one test case and must be a three-element list of the form $[s, e, p]$, where $s$ is the computed $f''(0)$ rounded to six decimal places, $e$ is the absolute error $|s - s_{\\mathrm{ref}}|$ rounded to six decimal places, and $p$ is a boolean indicating whether the four-significant-figure criterion is satisfied. For example, the output format must be\n$$\n[[s_1, e_1, p_1],[s_2, e_2, p_2],[s_3, e_3, p_3],[s_4, e_4, p_4]].\n$$",
            "solution": "The user has presented a problem that is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It involves the numerical solution of the Blasius equation, a classical problem in fluid mechanics, using a standard shooting method. All required data, boundary conditions, and evaluation criteria are provided. The problem is valid.\n\nThe core task is to solve a third-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) boundary value problem (BVP) for the dimensionless streamfunction profile $f(\\eta)$. The ODE is the Blasius equation:\n$$\nf'''(\\eta) + \\tfrac{1}{2} f(\\eta) \\, f''(\\eta) = 0\n$$\nsubject to the boundary conditions:\n$$\nf(0) = 0, \\quad f'(0) = 0, \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f'(\\eta \\to \\infty) = 1\n$$\nThe objective is to find the value of the unknown initial condition $f''(0)$. This type of BVP is well-suited for a shooting method, which transforms the BVP into an initial value problem (IVP) that can be solved iteratively.\n\n**Step 1: Conversion to a System of First-Order ODEs**\nTo use standard IVP solvers, the third-order ODE must be converted into a system of three first-order ODEs. We define a state vector $y(\\eta)$ as:\n$$\ny(\\eta) = \\begin{bmatrix} y_0(\\eta) \\\\ y_1(\\eta) \\\\ y_2(\\eta) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} f(\\eta) \\\\ f'(\\eta) \\\\ f''(\\eta) \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe derivatives of the components of $y$ with respect to $\\eta$ form the system:\n$$\n\\frac{d y}{d \\eta} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_0' \\\\ y_1' \\\\ y_2' \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} f' \\\\ f'' \\\\ f''' \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} f f'' \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ -0.5 \\, y_0 \\, y_2 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThis is the system of first-order ODEs that will be integrated numerically.\n\n**Step 2: The Shooting Method**\nThe shooting method addresses the missing initial condition, $f''(0)$, by treating it as a parameter, which we will call $s$. We \"shoot\" solutions from $\\eta=0$ by guessing $s$ and integrating the IVP. The goal is to adjust $s$ until the boundary condition at the far end of the domain is met.\n\nThe initial conditions for the IVP at $\\eta=0$ are:\n$$\nf(0) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad y_0(0) = 0\n$$\n$$\nf'(0) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad y_1(0) = 0\n$$\nThe missing condition is our shooting parameter:\n$$\nf''(0) = s \\quad \\implies \\quad y_2(0) = s\n$$\nThus, the initial state vector for our IVP is $y(0) = [0, 0, s]^T$.\n\nThe boundary condition at infinity, $f'(\\eta \\to \\infty) = 1$, is numerically intractable. We approximate it by enforcing the condition at a finite, but sufficiently large, value of the similarity variable, $\\eta = L$. The condition becomes $f'(L; s) = 1$, or in terms of our state vector, $y_1(L; s) = 1$. The parameter $L$ is one of the inputs specified in the test suite.\n\nWe define a residual function, $R(s; L)$, which measures how far a given guess $s$ is from satisfying the far-field boundary condition:\n$$\nR(s; L) = y_1(L; s) - 1\n$$\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the root of the equation $R(s;L) = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Numerical Implementation**\nThe overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For each test case, specified by the tuple $(L, \\mathrm{rtol}, \\mathrm{atol})$, we need to find the value of $s$ that solves $R(s; L) = 0$.\n2.  The evaluation of the residual function $R(s; L)$ for any given $s$ requires the numerical integration of the first-order ODE system from $\\eta=0$ to $\\eta=L$ with the initial condition $y(0) = [0, 0, s]^T$. This integration is performed using a modern adaptive ODE solver, specifically `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`, with the provided relative tolerance `rtol` and absolute tolerance `atol`. This solver automatically adjusts its internal step size to achieve the desired accuracy.\n3.  A robust one-dimensional root-finding algorithm is used to find the value of $s$ for which $R(s; L) = 0$. The `scipy.optimize.brentq` function, which implements Brent's method, is an excellent choice. It requires a bracket, an interval $[s_a, s_b]$, where the residual function has opposite signs at the endpoints, i.e., $R(s_a; L) \\times R(s_b; L)  0$. A suitable bracket is $[0, 1]$. For $s=0$, the solution is trivially $f(\\eta)=0$, so $y_1(L)=0$ and $R(0; L) = -1$. For $s=1$, the initial curvature is large, and we expect the velocity profile to overshoot the target, making $y_1(L)  1$ and thus $R(1; L)  0$. This bracket guarantees a root.\n4.  Once the root $s$ (our approximation of $f''(0)$) is found, it is compared against the high-precision reference value $s_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0.332057336215$. The absolute error $e = |s - s_{\\mathrm{ref}}|$ is calculated.\n5.  A pass/fail flag, $p$, is set to `True` if the accuracy criterion, $e \\le 0.00005$, is met, and `False` otherwise.\n6.  The computed value $s$ and the error $e$ are rounded to six decimal places, and the triplet $[s, e, p]$ is stored. This process is repeated for all test cases.\n\nThe final output is a list of these triplets, formatted as a string according to the problem specification.",

This exercise introduces the semi-empirical $e^N$ method, a widely-used engineering tool for estimating the transition location based on the amplification of Tollmien-Schlichting waves. You will implement a model to integrate local disturbance growth rates and determine where the cumulative amplification factor reaches a critical threshold, providing a practical introduction to stability analysis .",

            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional, incompressible, laminar boundary layer over a smooth, flat plate in a uniform free stream. Small-amplitude disturbances are assumed to evolve under linear stability considerations, and their streamwise spatial amplification is taken to be slow enough that a local growth-rate description is meaningful. The goal is to determine the streamwise transition location where the cumulative disturbance growth reaches a specified threshold using the exponential $e^N$ framework. All lengths must be expressed in meters, all velocities in meters per second, all viscosities in square meters per second, and the final transition locations must be reported in meters rounded to four decimal places.\n\nStarting from a fundamental base, model the disturbance amplitude $A(x)$ as evolving according to a linear ordinary differential equation in the streamwise coordinate $x$ with a local growth rate $s(x)$ such that the rate of change of $A(x)$ with respect to $x$ is proportional to $A(x)$ and to $s(x)$. The cumulative growth factor $N(x)$ is defined as the natural logarithm of the amplitude ratio from a reference location $x_0$. Transition is considered to occur at the smallest streamwise location $x_t$ where the cumulative growth $N(x)$ reaches a specified threshold $N_{\\mathrm{th}}$. If $N(x)$ never reaches $N_{\\mathrm{th}}$ within the computational domain, the transition location must be reported as $-1.0$.\n\nTo close the model computationally without invoking full Orr–Sommerfeld analysis, adopt an envelope model for the local spatial amplification rate $s(x)$ that is dimensionally consistent and qualitatively representative of Tollmien–Schlichting (TS) wave amplification in a zero to mildly varying external pressure gradient. Let the external velocity be modeled as $U_e(x) = U_\\infty \\left(\\frac{x}{x_0}\\right)^m$ for $x \\ge x_0$, where $U_\\infty$ is the free-stream speed, $m$ is the Falkner–Skan pressure-gradient exponent ($m = 0$ for zero pressure gradient, $m  0$ for adverse pressure gradient, and $m  0$ for favorable pressure gradient), and $x_0$ is the leading-edge offset where the boundary layer is assumed to be sufficiently developed to support linear instability analysis. Define the local Reynolds number based on $x$ as $Re_x(x) = \\dfrac{U_e(x) \\, x}{\\nu}$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. Use the following envelope model for $s(x)$:\nFor $Re_x(x)  Re_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, let $s(x) = 0$; for $Re_x(x) \\ge Re_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, define\n$$\ns(x) = F_{\\mathrm{pg}} \\, c_0 \\, \\frac{U_e(x)}{\\nu} \\left( \\frac{Re_x(x) - Re_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{Re_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right)^{p} \\exp\\!\\left( -\\beta \\, \\frac{Re_x(x)}{Re_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $c_0$ is a dimensionless scaling constant, $Re_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is the onset Reynolds number for instability, $Re_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is a reference Reynolds number scaling the envelope, $p$ is a positive exponent controlling the near-onset growth behavior, and $\\beta$ is a positive envelope-decay parameter. The factor $F_{\\mathrm{pg}} = 1 - r \\, m$ models the first-order destabilizing or stabilizing influence of the pressure gradient on the disturbance growth envelope, with $r$ a positive constant. The function $s(x)$ has units of inverse meters, ensuring that the cumulative growth integral $N(x)$ is dimensionless.\n\nYour task is to write a program that, for given parameters, computes the cumulative growth\n$$\nN(x) = \\int_{x_0}^{x} s(\\xi) \\, d\\xi\n$$\nand finds the smallest $x_t \\in [x_0, x_{\\mathrm{end}}]$ such that $N(x_t) = N_{\\mathrm{th}}$. If no such $x_t$ exists within $[x_0, x_{\\mathrm{end}}]$, you must return $-1.0$. Use numerical quadrature over a uniform grid in $x \\in [x_0, x_{\\mathrm{end}}]$ and perform linear interpolation between adjacent grid points to refine the crossing location of $N(x)$ with $N_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The output must be expressed in meters, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nImplement and test your program using the following test suite. Each test case specifies the parameters $(U_\\infty, \\nu, x_0, x_{\\mathrm{end}}, m, c_0, Re_{\\mathrm{crit}}, Re_{\\mathrm{ref}}, p, \\beta, N_{\\mathrm{th}})$ in International System of Units (SI), with $r = 1.5$ fixed for all cases.\n\n- Test case $1$ (general case, zero pressure gradient): $(U_\\infty = 30.0, \\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}, x_0 = 0.05, x_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1.5, m = 0.0, c_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}, Re_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 3.5 \\times 10^{5}, Re_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}, p = 1.0, \\beta = 0.3, N_{\\mathrm{th}} = 9.0)$.\n- Test case $2$ (no transition within domain): $(U_\\infty = 15.0, \\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}, x_0 = 0.05, x_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1.5, m = 0.0, c_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}, Re_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 3.5 \\times 10^{5}, Re_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}, p = 1.0, \\beta = 0.3, N_{\\mathrm{th}} = 9.0)$.\n- Test case $3$ (adverse pressure gradient destabilization): $(U_\\infty = 20.0, \\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}, x_0 = 0.05, x_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1.5, m = -0.25, c_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}, Re_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 3.5 \\times 10^{5}, Re_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}, p = 1.0, \\beta = 0.3, N_{\\mathrm{th}} = 9.0)$.\n- Test case $4$ (higher threshold near domain end): $(U_\\infty = 30.0, \\nu = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}, x_0 = 0.05, x_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1.5, m = 0.0, c_0 = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}, Re_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 3.5 \\times 10^{5}, Re_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}, p = 1.0, \\beta = 0.3, N_{\\mathrm{th}} = 11.5)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, e.g., $[x_{t,1}, x_{t,2}, x_{t,3}, x_{t,4}]$, where each $x_{t,i}$ is the transition location for test case $i$ in meters, rounded to four decimal places.

The $e^N$ method is a standard, albeit semi-empirical, engineering tool for transition prediction. The models for velocity, Reynolds number, and the disturbance growth rate envelope are simplified but physically representative models used in this field. The dimensional consistency is sound: $s(x)$ has units of $m^{-1}$, so its integral $N(x)$ is dimensionless.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It requires finding the root of the equation $N(x) - N_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0$. Since the growth rate $s(x)$ is non-negative, the cumulative growth function $N(x)$ is monotonically non-decreasing. This ensures that if a solution exists, it is unique (as the smallest $x_t$ is sought). The problem provides a clear procedure for finding the solution numerically and specifies the outcome if no solution exists within the given domain.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. There are no subjective elements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary parameters, equations, boundary conditions (the domain $[x_0, x_{\\mathrm{end}}]$), and numerical procedures are specified. The test cases provide complete sets of data required for a solution. There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Feasibility**: The physical parameters and ranges are realistic for aeronautical and mechanical engineering applications. The computational task is feasible and well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be formulated based on the provided models and computational instructions.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to find the transition location $x_t$ on a flat plate, defined as the point where the cumulative growth factor $N(x)$ of boundary layer disturbances first reaches a specified threshold $N_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The cumulative growth is calculated by integrating a modeled spatial amplification rate $s(x)$ from a starting location $x_0$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to solve for $x_t$ for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Discretize the Domain**: The spatial domain $[x_0, x_{\\mathrm{end}}]$ is discretized into a fine, uniform grid of points, $\\{x_i\\}_{i=0}^M$, where $x_i = x_0 + i \\cdot \\Delta x$ and $\\Delta x = (x_{\\mathrm{end}} - x_0)/M$. A sufficiently large number of points $M+1$ is chosen to ensure the accuracy of the numerical integration.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Local Amplification Rate**: For each point $x_i$ on the grid, the local amplification rate $s(x_i)$ is computed. This involves a sequence of calculations based on the provided models:\n    a.  Calculate the external velocity $U_e(x_i) = U_\\infty \\left(\\frac{x_i}{x_0}\\right)^m$.\n    b.  Calculate the local Reynolds number $Re_x(x_i) = \\frac{U_e(x_i) \\, x_i}{\\nu}$.\n    c.  Evaluate the amplification rate $s(x_i)$. If $Re_x(x_i)$ is below the critical Reynolds number $Re_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the flow is stable, and $s(x_i) = 0$. Otherwise, $s(x_i)$ is calculated using the given envelope formula:\n        $$\n        s(x_i) = (1 - r \\, m) \\, c_0 \\, \\frac{U_e(x_i)}{\\nu} \\left( \\frac{Re_x(x_i) - Re_{\\mathrm{crit}}}{Re_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right)^{p} \\exp\\!\\left( -\\beta \\, \\frac{Re_x(x_i)}{Re_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right)\n        $$\n\n3.  **Compute the Cumulative Growth Factor**: The cumulative growth factor $N(x)$ is the integral of the amplification rate, $N(x) = \\int_{x_0}^{x} s(\\xi) \\, d\\xi$. This integral is computed numerically over the grid. We use the trapezoidal rule, which is efficient and well-suited for a fine grid. The value of $N(x_i)$ at each grid point $x_i$ is obtained by accumulating the areas of the trapezoids formed by the $s(x)$ function:\n    $$\n    N(x_i) \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{i} \\frac{s(x_{j-1}) + s(x_j)}{2} \\Delta x\n    $$\n    This is efficiently implemented using a cumulative trapezoidal integration function, yielding an array of values $\\{N(x_i)\\}_{i=0}^M$, where $N(x_0) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Transition Location**: We search the array $\\{N(x_i)\\}$ for the first index $i$ where $N(x_i) \\ge N_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n    a.  If no such index is found up to $i=M$, it means $N(x_{\\mathrm{end}})  N_{\\mathrm{th}}$, and transition does not occur within the computational domain. In this case, the result is reported as $-1.0$.\n    b.  If such an index $i$ is found, the transition location $x_t$ lies in the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$. To find its precise value, we perform linear interpolation. Assuming a straight line connects the points $(x_{i-1}, N(x_{i-1}))$ and $(x_i, N(x_i))$, we find the value $x_t$ that corresponds to $N(x_t) = N_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n        $$\n        x_t = x_{i-1} + (x_i - x_{i-1}) \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{th}} - N(x_{i-1})}{N(x_i) - N(x_{i-1})}\n        $$\n\n5.  **Finalize Output**: The calculated transition location $x_t$ is rounded to four decimal places. If transition does not occur, the value is reported as $-1.0000$ as per the problem specification. This procedure is repeated for all four test cases provided.\n\nThe implementation will use the `numpy` library for efficient vectorized computations and `scipy.integrate.cumulative_trapezoid` for accurate numerical integration.",
