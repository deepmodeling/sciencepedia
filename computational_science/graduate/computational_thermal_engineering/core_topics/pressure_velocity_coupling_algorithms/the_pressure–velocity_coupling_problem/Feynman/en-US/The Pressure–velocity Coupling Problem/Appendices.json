            "introduction": "Before diving into complex solution algorithms, it is crucial to understand the numerical challenge that motivates them. A naive discretization of the incompressible flow equations on a collocated grid, where pressure and velocity components are stored at the same location, can lead to a critical failure known as pressure-velocity decoupling. This practice will guide you through a numerical experiment to diagnose this very issue, demonstrating analytically and computationally why a staggered grid arrangement is inherently more robust at preventing non-physical pressure oscillations .",

            "problem": "Consider the incompressible, isothermal, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a two-dimensional channel in the absence of thermal gradients. The governing equations are the continuity equation and the momentum equation, stated respectively as\n$$\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0,$$\n$$\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + \\rho (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u},$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u} = (u,v)$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. Under a pressure–velocity splitting (projection) viewpoint, the pressure is responsible for enforcing the continuity constraint by correcting a predicted velocity via\n$$\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^{*} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\nabla p,$$\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the time increment, $\\mathbf{u}^{*}$ is the predicted velocity, and $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$ is the divergence-free corrected velocity. In a discrete setting, how $\\nabla p$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$ are constructed depends on the grid arrangement. A naive collocated grid stores $u$, $v$, and $p$ at cell centers, approximating derivatives by central differences; a staggered grid (Marker-And-Cell (MAC) arrangement) stores $p$ at cell centers while $u$ and $v$ are stored at cell faces. It is well known in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that the naive collocated arrangement can admit spurious odd–even pressure modes (checkerboard oscillations), whereas staggered grids suppress them because face-centered fluxes directly sense cell-centered pressure differences.\n\nYour task is to derive and implement, from first principles, discrete operators for both arrangements and demonstrate numerically that a pure checkerboard pressure mode produces negligible mass-flux divergence on the naive collocated scheme (revealing decoupling), but non-negligible divergence on the staggered scheme (revealing coupling that suppresses oscillations). Treat the domain as a rectangular, uniform grid of size $N_x \\times N_y$ with spacings $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$, and employ periodic boundary conditions in both directions to isolate interior coupling effects without boundary layers. Use a synthetic checkerboard pressure field\n$$p_{i,j} = p_0 (-1)^{i+j},$$\nwith amplitude $p_0$ (in $\\mathrm{Pa}$), and evaluate the divergence of the pressure-correction-induced velocity field for each scheme as follows:\n\n- For the naive collocated scheme:\n  - Place $u$, $v$, and $p$ at cell centers $(i,j)$.\n  - Approximate the cell-centered pressure gradients by central differences:\n    $$\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{p_{i+1,j} - p_{i-1,j}}{2\\Delta x}, \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{p_{i,j+1} - p_{i,j-1}}{2\\Delta y}.$$\n  - Define the corrected cell-centered velocities:\n    $$u_{i,j}^{c} = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)_{i,j}, \\quad v_{i,j}^{c} = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}\\right)_{i,j}.$$\n  - Construct face mass fluxes by naive linear interpolation of cell-centered velocities:\n    $$u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}^{c} = \\frac{u_{i,j}^{c} + u_{i+1,j}^{c}}{2}, \\quad v_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}^{c} = \\frac{v_{i,j}^{c} + v_{i,j+1}^{c}}{2}.$$\n  - Compute the cell-centered discrete divergence:\n    $$\\left(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{c}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}^{c} - u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}^{c}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{v_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}^{c} - v_{i,j-\\frac{1}{2}}^{c}}{\\Delta y}.$$\n\n- For the staggered MAC scheme:\n  - Place $p$ at cell centers $(i,j)$, $u$ at vertical faces $(i+\\frac{1}{2}, j)$, and $v$ at horizontal faces $(i, j+\\frac{1}{2})$.\n  - Approximate the face-centered pressure gradients by one-cell differences:\n    $$u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s} = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\frac{p_{i+1,j} - p_{i,j}}{\\Delta x}, \\quad v_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}^{s} = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\frac{p_{i,j+1} - p_{i,j}}{\\Delta y}.$$\n  - Compute the cell-centered discrete divergence:\n    $$\\left(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{s}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s} - u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{v_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}^{s} - v_{i,j-\\frac{1}{2}}^{s}}{\\Delta y}.$$\n\nDerive, using the above definitions and the synthetic $p_{i,j}$, why the collocated central differences yield $\\left(\\partial p / \\partial x\\right)_{i,j} = 0$ and $\\left(\\partial p / \\partial y\\right)_{i,j} = 0$ for the checkerboard mode, while the staggered face differences do not vanish, and hence the collocated divergence is negligible whereas the staggered divergence is non-negligible. To quantify the effect, define the root-mean-square (RMS) divergence for scheme $\\star \\in \\{c, s\\}$ as\n$$\\mathcal{D}_{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N_x N_y} \\sum_{i=0}^{N_x-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{N_y-1} \\left(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{\\star}\\right)_{i,j}^2}.$$\nAs a suppression metric, report the dimensionless ratio\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\mathcal{D}_{s}}{\\mathcal{D}_{c} + \\varepsilon},$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is a small positive number to avoid division by zero, chosen proportional to $\\mathcal{D}_{s}$ (e.g., $\\varepsilon = 10^{-16} \\mathcal{D}_{s}$). A large value of $\\mathcal{R}$ indicates that the staggered scheme strongly couples pressure to mass flux, thereby suppressing oscillations relative to the naive collocated scheme.\n\nPhysical units: take $p_0$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\rho$ in $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ in $\\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta t$ in $\\mathrm{s}$. The output ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ is dimensionless.\n\nTest suite: run your program for the following parameter sets, each specified as $(N_x, N_y, \\Delta x, \\Delta y, \\rho, \\Delta t, p_0)$:\n- Case A (general case): $(32, 32, 1.0\\times 10^{-2}, 1.0\\times 10^{-2}, 1.0, 1.0\\times 10^{-3}, 1.0)$.\n- Case B (coarse grid edge case): $(8, 8, 1.0\\times 10^{-2}, 1.0\\times 10^{-2}, 1.0, 5.0\\times 10^{-4}, 1.0)$.\n- Case C (anisotropic channel aspect): $(64, 4, 5.0\\times 10^{-3}, 1.25\\times 10^{-2}, 1.0, 2.0\\times 10^{-3}, 1.0)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the three suppression ratios for Cases A, B, and C as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[\\mathcal{R}_A,\\mathcal{R}_B,\\mathcal{R}_C]$). The output must be a list of floating-point numbers in decimal notation on that single line. No other text should be printed. Express all intermediate quantities internally in their proper units as specified; the final ratios are dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem at hand is a classic numerical experiment in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) designed to illustrate the pressure-velocity coupling problem on different grid arrangements. Specifically, it contrasts a naive collocated grid, where all variables ($u$, $v$, $p$) are stored at cell centers, with a staggered Marker-And-Cell (MAC) grid, where scalar pressure $p$ is at cell centers while velocity components $u$ and $v$ are stored at cell faces. The core issue is that certain non-physical pressure oscillations, known as checkerboard modes, can exist undetected by the discrete operators of a naive collocated scheme, leading to numerical instabilities. A staggered grid, by its construction, correctly couples pressure gradients to mass fluxes, thereby preventing such spurious modes. We will demonstrate this analytically and then verify it numerically.\n\nThe analysis is performed on a synthetic checkerboard pressure field defined on a uniform $N_x \\times N_y$ grid with spacings $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$. The pressure at the center of cell $(i,j)$ is given by\n$$p_{i,j} = p_0 (-1)^{i+j},$$\nwhere $p_0$ is the amplitude. The analysis relies on evaluating the divergence of the velocity field induced solely by the pressure correction step of a projection method, $\\mathbf{u}^{\\star} = -(\\Delta t / \\rho) \\nabla p$, where for simplicity we analyze the velocity field induced from a zero state. Periodic boundary conditions are assumed, and all test cases use even numbers for $N_x$ and $N_y$.\n\n### Analysis of the Naive Collocated Scheme\n\nIn the collocated scheme, all variables, including pressure $p$ and velocity components $u$ and $v$, are stored at the cell center $(i,j)$.\n\n1.  **Pressure Gradient Calculation**: The pressure gradient components are approximated at the cell center $(i,j)$ using central differences:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{p_{i+1,j} - p_{i-1,j}}{2\\Delta x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}\\right)_{i,j} \\approx \\frac{p_{i,j+1} - p_{i,j-1}}{2\\Delta y}. $$\n    Substituting the checkerboard pressure field $p_{i,j} = p_0 (-1)^{i+j}$:\n    $$ \\frac{p_{i+1,j} - p_{i-1,j}}{2\\Delta x} = \\frac{p_0(-1)^{(i+1)+j} - p_0(-1)^{(i-1)+j}}{2\\Delta x} = \\frac{p_0(-1)^{i+j}}{2\\Delta x} \\left( (-1)^1 - (-1)^{-1} \\right) = \\frac{p_0(-1)^{i+j}}{2\\Delta x} (-1 - (-1)) = 0. $$\n    Similarly, for the $y$-gradient:\n    $$ \\frac{p_{i,j+1} - p_{i,j-1}}{2\\Delta y} = \\frac{p_0(-1)^{i+(j+1)} - p_0(-1)^{i+(j-1)}}{2\\Delta y} = \\frac{p_0(-1)^{i+j}}{2\\Delta y} \\left( (-1)^1 - (-1)^{-1} \\right) = 0. $$\n    This holds for all interior points and also at the boundaries due to the periodic conditions and the even number of grid cells in each direction. The $2\\Delta x$ central difference stencil is blind to the highest frequency (Nyquist) mode on the grid.\n\n2.  **Velocity Field and Divergence**: The pressure-correction-induced velocity components at the cell centers, denoted $\\mathbf{u}^c = (u^c, v^c)$, are:\n    $$ u_{i,j}^{c} = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)_{i,j} = 0, \\quad v_{i,j}^{c} = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}\\right)_{i,j} = 0. $$\n    The velocities are zero at all cell centers.\n\n3.  **Mass Flux and Divergence**: The scheme constructs mass fluxes at cell faces by averaging the cell-centered velocities. For the face at $(i+\\frac{1}{2}, j)$:\n    $$ u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}^{c} = \\frac{u_{i,j}^{c} + u_{i+1,j}^{c}}{2} = \\frac{0 + 0}{2} = 0. $$\n    Similarly, $v_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}^{c} = 0$. Since all face fluxes are zero, the discrete divergence at cell $(i,j)$ is identically zero:\n    $$ \\left(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{c}\\right)_{i,j} = \\frac{u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}^{c} - u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}^{c}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{v_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}^{c} - v_{i,j-\\frac{1}{2}}^{c}}{\\Delta y} = 0. $$\n    Therefore, the root-mean-square (RMS) divergence for the collocated scheme is $\\mathcal{D}_{c} = 0$. In a numerical implementation, this value will be subject to floating-point error but should be negligible (on the order of machine precision).\n\n### Analysis of the Staggered (MAC) Scheme\n\nIn the staggered scheme, pressure $p$ is at the cell center $(i,j)$, the $u$-velocity component is at vertical faces $(i+\\frac{1}{2}, j)$, and the $v$-velocity component is at horizontal faces $(i, j+\\frac{1}{2})$.\n\n1.  **Face Velocity Calculation**: The pressure gradient is evaluated directly across a single cell to compute the velocity at the face. For the $u$-velocity at face $(i+\\frac{1}{2}, j)$, denoted $u^s_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}$:\n    $$ u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s} = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\frac{p_{i+1,j} - p_{i,j}}{\\Delta x} = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho \\Delta x} \\left[ p_0(-1)^{(i+1)+j} - p_0(-1)^{i+j} \\right] $$\n    $$ = -\\frac{\\Delta t p_0(-1)^{i+j}}{\\rho \\Delta x} \\left[ (-1)^1 - 1 \\right] = \\frac{2 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho \\Delta x} (-1)^{i+j}. $$\n    Similarly, for the $v$-velocity at face $(i, j+\\frac{1}{2})$:\n    $$ v_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}^{s} = -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\frac{p_{i,j+1} - p_{i,j}}{\\Delta y} = \\frac{2 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho \\Delta y} (-1)^{i+j}. $$\n    Unlike the collocated scheme, the staggered arrangement produces a non-zero velocity field in response to the checkerboard pressure.\n\n2.  **Divergence Calculation**: The discrete divergence at cell center $(i,j)$ is:\n    $$ \\left(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{s}\\right)_{i,j} = \\frac{u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s} - u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s}}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{v_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}^{s} - v_{i,j-\\frac{1}{2}}^{s}}{\\Delta y}. $$\n    We need the velocity at the left face, $u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s}$, which is calculated as:\n    $$ u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s} = \\frac{2 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho \\Delta x} (-1)^{(i-1)+j} = -\\frac{2 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho \\Delta x} (-1)^{i+j}. $$\n    Substituting into the divergence expression:\n    $$ \\frac{u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s} - u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}^{s}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x} \\left[ \\frac{2 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho \\Delta x} (-1)^{i+j} - \\left(-\\frac{2 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho \\Delta x} (-1)^{i+j}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{4 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho (\\Delta x)^2} (-1)^{i+j}. $$\n    The term for the $y$-direction is analogous. The total divergence is:\n    $$ \\left(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{s}\\right)_{i,j} = \\left[ \\frac{4 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho (\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{4 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho (\\Delta y)^2} \\right] (-1)^{i+j} = \\frac{4 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho} \\left( \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta y)^2} \\right) (-1)^{i+j}. $$\n    This expression represents a discrete Laplacian of the pressure field, confirming that the staggered divergence operator is strongly coupled to pressure variations. The divergence is clearly non-zero.\n\n3.  **RMS Divergence**: To find the RMS divergence $\\mathcal{D}_s$, we square the divergence at each cell, average over the grid, and take the square root. The term $(-1)^{i+j}$ squares to $1$, making the squared divergence constant across all cells:\n    $$ \\left( \\left(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{s}\\right)_{i,j} \\right)^2 = \\left[ \\frac{4 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho} \\left( \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta y)^2} \\right) \\right]^2. $$\n    The RMS value is simply the absolute value of the constant factor:\n    $$ \\mathcal{D}_{s} = \\frac{4 \\Delta t p_0}{\\rho} \\left( \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta y)^2} \\right). $$\n    This is a non-zero, non-negligible value.\n\n### Suppression Metric\n\nThe suppression metric $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined as $\\mathcal{R} = \\mathcal{D}_{s} / (\\mathcal{D}_{c} + \\varepsilon)$. Since we found that $\\mathcal{D}_{c}$ is analytically zero (and numerically negligible), the denominator is dominated by the regularization term $\\varepsilon = 10^{-16} \\mathcal{D}_{s}$.\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\mathcal{D}_{s}}{\\mathcal{D}_{c} + 10^{-16} \\mathcal{D}_{s}} \\approx \\frac{\\mathcal{D}_{s}}{10^{-16} \\mathcal{D}_{s}} = 10^{16}. $$\nA very large value for $\\mathcal{R}$ signifies that the staggered grid generates a strong divergence (a strong correction signal) in response to a checkerboard pressure mode, whereas the naive collocated grid generates virtually no signal. This ability to \"see\" and thus correct high-frequency pressure oscillations is the fundamental advantage of the staggered grid arrangement.",

This powerful technique decouples the velocity and pressure updates by first predicting a preliminary velocity field that does not satisfy the incompressibility constraint, and then projecting it onto the space of divergence-free fields. This exercise provides a direct, hands-on experience implementing the core predict-correct sequence, where you will solve a Poisson equation for the pressure and use it to enforce mass conservation .",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed sound. It outlines a standard numerical exercise in computational fluid dynamics, specifically the implementation of a single time step of a projection method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, simplified to the incompressible Stokes equations to isolate the pressure-velocity coupling mechanism. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed, providing all necessary equations, boundary conditions, discretization schemes, and parameters.\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing the specified algorithm step-by-step. All mathematical entities are represented in LaTeX as required.\n\n### 1. Discretization and Initial State\nThe domain is a square $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$, discretized by a uniform collocated grid with $N_x = N_y = N$ points. The grid spacing is $h = 1/(N-1)$. The grid indices $(i,j)$ range from $0$ to $N-1$ in both $x$ and $y$ directions, where $i$ corresponds to the $x$-direction and $j$ to the $y$-direction. The velocity field is $\\mathbf{u} = (u,v)$ and the pressure is $p$.\n\nThe initial velocity field at time $t^n$ is given as $\\mathbf{u}^n = (u^n, v^n) = \\mathbf{0}$ for all interior points. The boundary conditions are enforced on $\\mathbf{u}^n$:\n-   Top boundary ($j=N-1$): $u^n_{i,N-1} = U_0$ for $i \\in [0, N-1]$, $v^n_{i,N-1} = 0$. Note that at the corners, the no-slip condition from the side walls takes precedence, so $u^n_{0,N-1}=0$ and $u^n_{N-1,N-1}=0$.\n-   Other boundaries (bottom, left, right): No-slip condition, $u^n=0$ and $v^n=0$.\n\n### 2. Intermediate Velocity Computation\nThe first step is to compute an intermediate velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}^\\star$, by applying a diffusion step to the initial velocity field $\\mathbf{u}^n$. The advection term is omitted as per the problem's formulation for this step.\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}^\\star = \\mathbf{u}^n + \\nu \\Delta t \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}^n\n$$\nThe Laplacian, $\\nabla^2$, is discretized using a second-order central-difference 5-point stencil for the interior points, i.e., for $i,j \\in [1, N-2]$:\n$$\n(\\nabla^2 u^n)_{i,j} = \\frac{u^n_{i+1,j} + u^n_{i-1,j} + u^n_{i,j+1} + u^n_{i,j-1} - 4u^n_{i,j}}{h^2}\n$$\nA similar expression holds for $(\\nabla^2 v^n)_{i,j}$. The intermediate velocities $u^\\star$ and $v^\\star$ are computed for all interior points. Following the computation, the prescribed velocity boundary conditions are re-enforced on the $\\mathbf{u}^\\star$ field.\n\n### 3. Divergence of Intermediate Velocity\nThe discrete divergence of the intermediate velocity field $\\mathbf{u}^\\star$ is computed at the interior grid points $(i,j)$ for $i,j \\in [1, N-2]$ using second-order central differences:\n$$\n(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^\\star)_{i,j} = \\frac{u^\\star_{i+1,j} - u^\\star_{i-1,j}}{2h} + \\frac{v^\\star_{i,j+1} - v^\\star_{i,j-1}}{2h}\n$$\nThe divergence is set to zero at all boundary points. The discrete $L^2$ norm of this divergence field is then computed over the interior of the domain:\n$$\n\\|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^\\star\\|_2 = \\left( h^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} \\sum_{j=1}^{N-2} \\left( (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^\\star)_{i,j} \\right)^2 \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThis value quantifies the extent to which the intermediate velocity field fails to satisfy the incompressibility constraint.\n\n### 4. Pressure Poisson Equation\nTo enforce incompressibility on the final velocity field, a pressure field $p^{n+1}$ is found by solving the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE):\n$$\n\\nabla^2 p^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^\\star\n$$\nThis equation is subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, $\\partial p / \\partial n = 0$, on all boundaries, where $n$ is the direction normal to the boundary. The Laplacian operator on the left-hand side is discretized using a 5-point stencil that incorporates these boundary conditions. This results in a system of linear equations $A\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{p}$ is a vector of the unknown pressure values at all $N \\times N$ grid points, $A$ is the matrix representing the discretized Laplacian operator, and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the vector representing the source term $(1/\\Delta t) \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^\\star$.\n\nFor an interior point $(i,j)$, the equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{i+1,j} + p_{i-1,j} + p_{i,j+1} + p_{i,j-1} - 4p_{i,j}}{h^2} = \\frac{(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^\\star)_{i,j}}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nFor a boundary point, the stencil is modified to reflect the $\\partial p / \\partial n = 0$ condition. For example, at a bottom boundary point $(i,0)$, for $i \\in [1, N-2]$, the condition $\\partial p/\\partial y = 0$ is implemented using a ghost point $p_{i,-1} = p_{i,1}$, leading to the discretized equation:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{i+1,0} + p_{i-1,0} + 2p_{i,1} - 4p_{i,0}}{h^2} = \\frac{(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^\\star)_{i,0}}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nSimilar expressions are derived for all other boundary and corner points. The resulting matrix $A$ is singular. To obtain a unique solution, a reference pressure is set by enforcing $p^{n+1}=0$ at the center grid point $((N-1)/2, (N-1)/2)$. This is achieved by replacing the corresponding row in the matrix system with the constraint equation. The resulting non-singular linear system is solved for the pressure field $p^{n+1}$.\n\n### 5. Velocity Projection\nThe intermediate velocity $\\mathbf{u}^\\star$ is projected onto the space of divergence-free fields to yield the final, divergence-free velocity field $\\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^\\star - \\Delta t \\nabla p^{n+1}\n$$\nThe pressure gradient $\\nabla p^{n+1}$ is computed using second-order central differences in the interior and first-order one-sided differences at the boundaries. For an interior point $(i,j)$:\n$$\n(\\nabla p^{n+1})_{i,j} = \\left( \\frac{p^{n+1}_{i+1,j} - p^{n+1}_{i-1,j}}{2h}, \\frac{p^{n+1}_{i,j+1} - p^{n+1}_{i,j-1}}{2h} \\right)\n$$\nAt the boundaries, for example at the left boundary $i=0$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial p^{n+1}}{\\partial x}\\right)_{0,j} = \\frac{p^{n+1}_{1,j} - p^{n+1}_{0,j}}{h}\n$$\nAfter computing $u^{n+1}$ and $v^{n+1}$, the velocity boundary conditions are reapplied to finalize the velocity field for the new time step.\n\n### 6. Divergence of Corrected Velocity\nFinally, the discrete divergence of the corrected velocity field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}$, and its $L^2$ norm, $\\|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{n+1}\\|_2$, are computed over the interior points using the same formulas as in Step 3. This norm is expected to be significantly smaller than $\\|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^\\star\\|_2$, demonstrating the efficacy of the projection method in enforcing the incompressibility constraint.",

The fluid has constant density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$. The flow starts from rest at time $t=0$ and is driven by an imposed constant streamwise pressure gradient of magnitude $G$ in units of $\\mathrm{Pa/m}$.

PISO Algorithm\n\nThe PISO algorithm is a non-iterative method for pressure-velocity coupling that performs one predictor and multiple corrector steps within a single time step to enforce the incompressibility constraint. For this problem, we implement one predictor and two corrector steps. Let $\\mathbf{u}^n$ and $p^n$ be the known fields at the beginning of the time step.\n\n**Step 1: Velocity Predictor**\n\nAn intermediate velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}^*$, is explicitly calculated from the momentum equation using the pressure field from the previous time step, $p^n$.\n\n$$ \\frac{\\mathbf{u}^* - \\mathbf{u}^n}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\left( -\\nabla p^n + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}^n + \\mathbf{f} \\right) $$\nRearranging gives the predictor equation for $\\mathbf{u}^*$:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}^* = \\mathbf{u}^n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\left( -\\nabla p^n + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}^n + \\mathbf{f} \\right) $$\nThis predicted velocity field $\\mathbf{u}^*$ does not, in general, satisfy the continuity equation, i.e., $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^* \\neq 0$. The spatial root-mean-square of this divergence, $\\|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^*\\|_2$, is the first value to be reported for the time step.\n\n**Step 2: First Pressure-Velocity Correction**\n\nThe goal of the corrector step is to find a pressure correction, $p'$, and a corresponding velocity correction such that the new velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}^{(1)}$, satisfies the continuity equation. The corrected velocity and pressure are defined as:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}^{(1)} = \\mathbf{u}^* + \\delta\\mathbf{u}^{(1)} $$\n$$ p^{(1)} = p^n + p' $$\nThe update to the momentum equation from the predictor step to the first corrector step is simply the change in the pressure gradient term. The relation between the velocity correction and pressure correction is derived by subtracting the predictor equation from the corrected momentum equation, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathbf{u}^{(1)} - \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\Delta t} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla(p^{(1)}-p^n) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p' $$\nThis provides an explicit velocity correction formula:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}^{(1)} = \\mathbf{u}^* - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\nabla p' $$\nTo find $p'$, we enforce the incompressibility constraint on the corrected velocity, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{(1)} = 0$. Applying the divergence operator to the velocity correction equation gives:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{(1)} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^* - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\nabla^2 p' = 0 $$\nThis leads to the first Pressure-Poisson Equation (PPE) for the pressure correction $p'$:\n$$ \\nabla^2 p' = \\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nThis is an elliptic partial differential equation that we solve for $p'$. The solution requires boundary conditions. For the no-slip walls, the normal component of velocity ($v$) must remain zero. This implies that the normal component of the velocity correction must be zero at the wall. From the velocity correction formula, this imposes a zero-gradient (Neumann) boundary condition on the pressure correction: $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial y} = 0$. In the periodic $x$-direction, $p'$ is also periodic.\n\nAfter solving for $p'$, we update the velocity field to $\\mathbf{u}^{(1)}$. Due to discretization errors, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{(1)}$ may not be exactly zero. We compute and report its norm, $\\|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{(1)}\\|_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Second Pressure-Velocity Correction**\n\nThe PISO algorithm philosophy is to improve the satisfaction of the momentum and continuity equations by performing additional correction steps. We introduce a second pressure correction, $p''$, and a second velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}^{(2)}$. The process is analogous to the first correction:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}^{(2)} = \\mathbf{u}^{(1)} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\rho} \\nabla p'' $$\nEnforcing $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{(2)} = 0$ yields the second PPE:\n$$ \\nabla^2 p'' = \\frac{\\rho}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{(1)} $$\nNote that the source term is now the divergence of the previously corrected velocity field, $\\mathbf{u}^{(1)}$. We solve this PPE for $p''$ using the same boundary conditions as for $p'$. The velocity is then updated to $\\mathbf{u}^{(2)}$. The final divergence norm for the time step, $\\|\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^{(2)}\\|_2$, is then computed.\n\n**Step 4: Update for Next Time Step**\n\nThe fields are advanced to the next time step, $t^{n+1}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{u}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{u}^{(2)} $$\n$$ p^{n+1} = p^n + p' + p'' $$\nThis completes one full time step of the PISO algorithm.\n\n### 4. Implementation Details\n\n- **Boundary Conditions:** The problem states periodic boundaries in $x$ and no-slip walls at $y=0$ and $y=L_y$. We use ghost cells to implement these. For a generic field $\\phi$ on a padded grid with `(y, x)` indexing:\n    - Periodicity in $x$: $\\phi_{j,0} = \\phi_{j,N_x}$ and $\\phi_{j,N_x+1} = \\phi_{j,1}$.\n    - No-slip on walls for velocity components $u, v$: At the $y=0$ wall (index `j=1` on padded grid), the ghost cell value (at `j=0`) is the negative of the adjacent interior cell value to enforce zero velocity at the boundary interface. For example, $u_{0,i} = -u_{1,i}$.\n    - Zero-gradient for pressure on walls: At the $y=0$ wall, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}=0$ is approximated by setting the ghost cell pressure equal to the adjacent interior cell pressure: $p_{0,i} = p_{1,i}$.\n\n- **Poisson Solver:** The discretized PPE results in a large, sparse linear system of equations, $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{x}$ is the flattened vector of unknown pressure correction values. We construct the matrix $A$ representing the 5-point stencil of the Laplacian operator, incorporating the second-order accurate boundary conditions. The resulting system is singular due to the pure Neumann/periodic boundary conditions (the pressure is only known up to an additive constant). To ensure a unique solution, we enforce a reference pressure by setting the pressure correction at one cell (e.g., index `(0,0)`) to zero. This is done by modifying the corresponding row of matrix $A$ to be an identity row and setting the corresponding element in vector $\\mathbf{b}$ to zero. The system is then solved efficiently using `scipy.sparse.linalg.spsolve`.\n\n- **Numerical Stability:** The use of an explicit predictor requires the time step $\\Delta t$ to be constrained by the CFL and diffusive stability limits. The problem uses a purely explicit scheme for the viscous term, imposing $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\rho}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta x^2} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta y^2}\\right)^{-1}$. The provided test cases use $\\Delta t$ values that satisfy this criterion.\n\n- **Note on Collocated Grids:** The use of central differences for pressure gradients and velocity divergence on a collocated grid can lead to pressure-velocity decoupling (checkerboard pressure fields). Advanced schemes often employ Rhie-Chow interpolation to mitigate this. As this was not specified, it is omitted from this implementation, which adheres strictly to the problem statement. The chosen flow problem, which develops into a one-dimensional profile, is less susceptible to this issue than more complex flows.\n\nThe following Python code implements this algorithm.",
