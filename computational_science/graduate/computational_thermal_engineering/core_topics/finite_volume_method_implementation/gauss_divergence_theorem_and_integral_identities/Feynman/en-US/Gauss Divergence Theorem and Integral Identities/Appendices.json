It is a standard problem in vector calculus applied to the field of heat transfer. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two primary parts: first, the derivation of the divergence of a vector field in cylindrical coordinates from its fundamental definition, and second, the application of Gauss's divergence theorem to a specific heat transfer scenario.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Divergence in Cylindrical Coordinates\n\nThe divergence of a vector field $\\mathbf{F}$ is defined as the net outward flux per unit volume, as the volume shrinks to a point. Mathematically,\n$$ \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{F} = \\lim_{\\Delta V \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta V} \\oiint_{\\Delta S} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} $$\nwhere $\\Delta S$ is the closed surface bounding the infinitesimal volume element $\\Delta V$.\n\nWe consider an infinitesimal volume element in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$ defined by the ranges $r$ to $r+dr$, $\\theta$ to $\\theta+d\\theta$, and $z$ to $z+dz$. The vector field is expressed in terms of its cylindrical components as $\\mathbf{F} = F_r \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} + F_\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}} + F_z \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The volume of this element is $\\Delta V = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz$.\n\nThe total flux $\\oiint_{\\Delta S} \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}$ is the sum of fluxes through the six faces of the volume element.

Their area elements are $d\\mathbf{S}_{r} = -r\\,d\\theta\\,dz\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ (inner face) and $d\\mathbf{S}_{r+dr} = (r+dr)\\,d\\theta\\,dz\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ (outer face).\n    The net flux is the sum of flux out minus flux in:\n    $$ \\Delta\\Phi_r = \\left. \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} \\right|_{r+dr} + \\left. \\mathbf{F} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} \\right|_{r} = F_r(r+dr, \\theta, z)(r+dr)\\,d\\theta\\,dz - F_r(r, \\theta, z)r\\,d\\theta\\,dz $$\n    Let $g(r) = r\\,F_r(r, \\theta, z)$.

First, we determine the heat flux vector $\\mathbf{q}$.\n\nThe temperature field is $T(r,\\theta,z)=T_{b}+\\alpha r^{2}+\\beta z$.

Flux through the bottom disk ($S_{bot}$):\n    On this surface, $z=0$, and the outward normal vector is $-\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The differential surface element is $d\\mathbf{S} = -r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n    $$ \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{q} \\cdot (-\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} r\\,dr\\,d\\theta) = -q_z (r\\,dr\\,d\\theta) = -(-\\beta k_{0}r)(r\\,dr\\,d\\theta) = \\beta k_{0}r^{2}\\,dr\\,d\\theta $$\n    The integral over $S_{bot}$ is:\n    $$ \\iint_{S_{bot}} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}\\int_{0}^{R} (\\beta k_{0}r^{2}) \\,dr\\,d\\theta = \\beta k_{0} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}d\\theta \\int_{0}^{R}r^{2}\\,dr = \\beta k_{0}(2\\pi)\\left[\\frac{r^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{R} = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\beta k_{0}R^{3} $$\n\nThe total net outward flux is the sum of these three contributions:\n$$ \\text{Total Flux} = (-4\\pi\\alpha k_{0}R^{3}H) + \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\beta k_{0}R^{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi\\beta k_{0}R^{3}\\right) = -4\\pi\\alpha k_{0}R^{3}H $$\nThe fluxes through the top and bottom surfaces cancel, as the axial component of the heat flux, $q_z$, is independent of $z$.

The model of a line heat source is standard in physics and engineering. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-defined. The symmetries (axisymmetry, $z$-invariance) and boundary condition (vanishing at infinity) are sufficient to determine a unique form for the heat flux field. The goal of relating the field's strength to the source strength is a standard, solvable problem.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and unambiguous, using standard scientific terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in thermal engineering that can be solved using the specified principles.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Radial Heat Flux Profile**\n\nThe local statement of energy conservation for steady-state heat conduction without fluid motion is given by the heat equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = \\dot{q}_{gen} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{q}$ is the heat flux vector and $\\dot{q}_{gen}$ is the volumetric heat generation rate.\n\nThe problem states that there is no volumetric heat generation away from the filamentary heater on the $z$-axis. Therefore, for any point in the domain $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\setminus \\Gamma$, which corresponds to $r0$ in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, we have $\\dot{q}_{gen} = 0$. The governing equation for the heat flux in this region is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } r0 $$\nIn cylindrical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field $\\mathbf{q} = q_r \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r + q_\\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_\\theta + q_z \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$ is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r q_r) + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial q_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial q_z}{\\partial z} $$\nThe problem imposes symmetry conditions:\n1.  **Axisymmetry:** The field is independent of the angle $\\theta$. This implies that all partial derivatives with respect to $\\theta$ are zero, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. For a simple source on the axis of symmetry, there is no physical reason for heat to circulate, so the tangential component of the flux must be zero, $q_\\theta = 0$.\n2.  **z-invariance:** The field is independent of the axial coordinate $z$. This implies $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} = 0$. This means $\\frac{\\partial q_z}{\\partial z} = 0$. Furthermore, because the heat source is uniform along the $z$-axis, there are no axial temperature gradients to drive an axial heat flux. Combined with the condition that the flux vanishes at infinity, any constant axial flux must be zero, so we conclude $q_z=0$.\n\nWith these conditions, the heat flux vector simplifies to $\\mathbf{q} = q_r(r) \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r$, and the divergence equation reduces to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{d r}(r q_r) = 0 $$\nSince $r0$, we can multiply by $r$ to obtain:\n$$ \\frac{d}{d r}(r q_r) = 0 $$\nIntegrating this ordinary differential equation with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$ r q_r = C $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. The radial profile of the heat flux is therefore:\n$$ q_r(r) = \\frac{C}{r} $$\nThe entire heat flux vector field is $\\mathbf{q}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{C}{r} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r$.\n\nThe problem requires this result to be compatible with a finite net heat flow across any finite-radius cylindrical surface. Let's verify this. The net heat flow rate, $\\dot{Q}$, across a cylindrical surface of radius $r$ and length $L$ coaxial with the $z$-axis is given by the integral of the flux over the surface area:\n$$ \\dot{Q} = \\int_{S_{cyl}} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} q_r(r) (r \\, d\\theta \\, dz) = \\int_{0}^{L} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{C}{r}\\right) r \\, d\\theta \\, dz = C \\int_{0}^{L} dz \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} d\\theta = C(L)(2\\pi) = 2\\pi C L$$\nThis result is finite for any finite $L$ and is independent of the radius $r$, which is consistent with the principle of energy conservation for any source-free region between two cylinders.\n\n**Part 2: Relation of the Constant $C$ to the Power Density $q'**\n\nWe apply the integral form of the steady-state energy balance to the specified control volume $V$. The volume $V$ is a right circular cylinder of radius $a0$ and length $L0$, coaxial with the $z$-axis. The principle, which is an application of Gauss's divergence theorem to the energy conservation law, states that the total net heat flow out of the control volume's boundary surface $S$ must equal the total rate of heat generated within the volume $V$.\n$$ \\oiint_S \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\int_V \\dot{q}_{gen} d V $$\nWe evaluate the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of this equation separately.\n\n(a) **Net Outward Heat Flow (Surface Integral):**\nThe boundary surface $S$ of the cylinder consists of a top circular face ($S_{top}$), a bottom circular face ($S_{bottom}$), and a cylindrical side wall ($S_{side}$).\n$$ \\oiint_S \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\int_{S_{top}} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} + \\int_{S_{bottom}} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} + \\int_{S_{side}} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} $$\nThe heat flux vector is purely radial: $\\mathbf{q} = q_r(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r$.\n-   On $S_{top}$, the outward normal vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$. The dot product $\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = (q_r \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z = 0$.\n-   On $S_{bottom}$, the outward normal vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z$. The dot product $\\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = (q_r \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r) \\cdot (-\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_z) = 0$.\nTherefore, there is no heat flow across the top and bottom faces. The entire outward flux is through the side wall.\n-   On $S_{side}$, the radius is constant, $r=a$, and the outward normal vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r$. The area element is $d\\mathbf{A} = a \\, d\\theta \\, dz \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r$. The flux on this surface is $q_r(a) = C/a$.\nThe integral over the side wall is:\n$$ \\int_{S_{side}} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = \\int_0^L \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{C}{a} \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r\\right) \\cdot (a \\, d\\theta \\, dz \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_r) = \\int_0^L \\int_0^{2\\pi} C \\, d\\theta \\, dz $$\n$$ = C \\left( \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_0^L dz \\right) = C (2\\pi) (L) = 2\\pi C L $$\nSo, the LHS is $\\oiint_S \\mathbf{q} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = 2\\pi C L$.\n\n(b) **Total Heat Generation (Volume Integral):**\nThe heat source is the filamentary heater running along the $z$-axis, with a constant linear power density $q'$. The total length of the heater enclosed within the control volume $V$ is $L$. The total rate of heat generation inside $V$ is therefore:\n$$ \\int_V \\dot{q}_{gen} dV = q' L $$\nSo, the RHS is $q' L$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the total heat rate:\n$$ 2\\pi C L = q' L $$\nSince $L0$, we can divide both sides by $L$ to find the relationship between $q'$ and $C$:\n$$ q' = 2\\pi C $$\nThis provides the required closed-form expression for the linear power density $q'$ in terms of the constant $C$ from the radial flux profile. The units of $C$ are $(\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) \\cdot \\mathrm{m} = \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}}$, making the equation dimensionally consistent with $q'$ in $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}}$.",

            "problem": "A steady-state heat conduction problem is posed in a bounded domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$ with piecewise constant isotropic thermal conductivity $k0$. Let $V_P \\subset \\Omega$ be a control volume associated with a cell center at $\\mathbf{x}_P$ in a Finite Volume Method (FVM) discretization. The outward unit normal on $\\partial V_P$ is denoted by $\\mathbf{n}$. The conductive heat flux is given by Fourier’s law $\\mathbf{q}=-k \\nabla T$, and steady energy conservation without volumetric sources reads $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0$ in $\\Omega$.\n\nOne face of $\\partial V_P$, denoted $\\Gamma_b \\subset \\partial \\Omega \\cap \\partial V_P$, lies on a boundary where a Robin (mixed) condition is prescribed:\n$$\n-k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n} = h \\left(T - T_{\\infty}\\right) \\quad \\text{on } \\Gamma_b,\n$$\nwhere $h0$ is a specified heat transfer coefficient, $T_{\\infty}$ is a specified ambient temperature, and $\\partial T/\\partial n \\equiv \\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ with $\\mathbf{n}$ pointing outward from $V_P$. Let the area of $\\Gamma_b$ be $A_f0$, and let $d_n0$ be the normal distance from $\\mathbf{x}_P$ to the plane of $\\Gamma_b$.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in computational thermal engineering. All provided information is self-contained, consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive expressions for the coefficients $a_b$ and $s_b$ in the linearized form of the outward heat flow $F_b = a_b T_P - s_b$ through a boundary face $\\Gamma_b$ of a finite volume cell.\n\nThe starting point is the integral form of the steady-state energy conservation law over the control volume $V_P$. The governing equation in differential form is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0$, where $\\mathbf{q}$ is the heat flux vector. Integrating over $V_P$ and applying Gauss's divergence theorem yields:\n$$ \\oiint_{\\partial V_P} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = \\int_{V_P} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}) \\, dV = 0 $$\nThis equation states that the net heat flow across the boundary $\\partial V_P$ of the control volume is zero. The total flow is the sum of flows over the individual faces of the control volume. We are interested in the outward heat flow through the specific boundary face $\\Gamma_b$, which is defined as:\n$$ F_b = \\int_{\\Gamma_b} \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector from the control volume $V_P$.\n\nUsing Fourier's law of heat conduction, $\\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla T$, the expression for $F_b$ becomes:\n$$ F_b = \\int_{\\Gamma_b} (-k \\nabla T) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS $$\nAssuming the thermal conductivity $k$ is uniform in the vicinity of the face $\\Gamma_b$, we can write:\n$$ F_b = -k \\int_{\\Gamma_b} \\nabla T \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, dS = -k \\int_{\\Gamma_b} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n} \\, dS $$\nwhere $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n}$ is the derivative of the temperature in the direction of the outward normal $\\mathbf{n}$.\n\nThe problem states to assume a locally one-dimensional linear temperature variation normal to the boundary face $\\Gamma_b$. Let $x_n$ be the coordinate along the outward normal $\\mathbf{n}$, with $x_n=0$ on the face $\\Gamma_b$. The cell center $\\mathbf{x}_P$ is located at a normal distance $d_n$ from the face, which corresponds to $x_n = -d_n$. The temperature at the face is $T(x_n=0) = T_b$ and at the cell center is $T(x_n=-d_n) = T_P$. The linear temperature profile is given by $T(x_n) = C_1 x_n + C_2$. Applying the boundary conditions:\n$T(0) = T_b \\implies C_2 = T_b$.\n$T(-d_n) = T_P \\implies C_1(-d_n) + T_b = T_P \\implies C_1 = \\frac{T_P - T_b}{-d_n} = \\frac{T_b - T_P}{d_n}$.\nThe temperature gradient normal to the face is constant and equal to $C_1$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x_n}\\bigg|_{x_n=0} = C_1 = \\frac{T_b - T_P}{d_n} $$\n\nSubstituting this gradient into the expression for $F_b$:\n$$ F_b = -k \\int_{\\Gamma_b} \\left(\\frac{T_b - T_P}{d_n}\\right) dS $$\nSince $T_b$, $T_P$, $d_n$, and $k$ are constant over the face $\\Gamma_b$ (a consequence of the local 1D assumption), we can take the integrand out of the integral:\n$$ F_b = -k \\left(\\frac{T_b - T_P}{d_n}\\right) \\int_{\\Gamma_b} dS $$\nThe integral is the area of the face, $A_f$.\n$$ F_b = -k A_f \\left(\\frac{T_b - T_P}{d_n}\\right) = \\frac{k A_f}{d_n} (T_P - T_b) $$\nThis expression for the heat flow depends on the unknown boundary temperature $T_b$. We must eliminate $T_b$ using the prescribed Robin boundary condition:\n$$ -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n} = h (T - T_{\\infty}) \\quad \\text{on } \\Gamma_b $$\nAt the boundary face, $T = T_b$. Substituting the expression for the normal derivative $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial n}$:\n$$ -k \\left(\\frac{T_b - T_P}{d_n}\\right) = h (T_b - T_{\\infty}) $$\nNow, we solve this algebraic equation for $T_b$:\n$$ \\frac{k}{d_n} (T_P - T_b) = h (T_b - T_{\\infty}) $$\n$$ \\frac{k}{d_n} T_P - \\frac{k}{d_n} T_b = h T_b - h T_{\\infty} $$\n$$ \\frac{k}{d_n} T_P + h T_{\\infty} = T_b \\left(h + \\frac{k}{d_n}\\right) $$\n$$ T_b = \\frac{\\frac{k}{d_n} T_P + h T_{\\infty}}{h + \\frac{k}{d_n}} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $d_n$ gives a simpler form:\n$$ T_b = \\frac{k T_P + h d_n T_{\\infty}}{k + h d_n} $$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $T_b$ back into our equation for $F_b$:\n$$ F_b = \\frac{k A_f}{d_n} (T_P - T_b) = \\frac{k A_f}{d_n} \\left( T_P - \\frac{k T_P + h d_n T_{\\infty}}{k + h d_n} \\right) $$\nTo simplify the term in the parenthesis, we use a common denominator $(k + h d_n)$:\n$$ T_P - \\frac{k T_P + h d_n T_{\\infty}}{k + h d_n} = \\frac{T_P(k + h d_n) - (k T_P + h d_n T_{\\infty})}{k + h d_n} $$\n$$ = \\frac{k T_P + h d_n T_P - k T_P - h d_n T_{\\infty}}{k + h d_n} = \\frac{h d_n T_P - h d_n T_{\\infty}}{k + h d_n} = \\frac{h d_n (T_P - T_{\\infty})}{k + h d_n} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $F_b$:\n$$ F_b = \\frac{k A_f}{d_n} \\left( \\frac{h d_n (T_P - T_{\\infty})}{k + h d_n} \\right) $$\nThe term $d_n$ cancels out:\n$$ F_b = \\frac{k h A_f (T_P - T_{\\infty})}{k + h d_n} $$\nFinally, we arrange this expression into the target linearized form $F_b = a_b T_P - s_b$:\n$$ F_b = \\left( \\frac{k h A_f}{k + h d_n} \\right) T_P - \\left( \\frac{k h A_f T_{\\infty}}{k + h d_n} \\right) $$\nBy comparing the terms, we identify the coefficients $a_b$ and $s_b$:\n$$ a_b = \\frac{k h A_f}{k + h d_n} $$\n$$ s_b = \\frac{k h A_f T_{\\infty}}{k + h d_n} $$\nThe problem requires $a_b$ and $s_b$ to be non-negative. Given that $k0$, $h0$, $d_n0$, and $A_f0$, the coefficient $a_b$ is strictly positive. For $s_b$ to be non-negative, we must have $T_{\\infty} \\geq 0$, which is a reasonable physical assumption for temperature expressed on an absolute scale (e.g., Kelvin). These derived expressions are in their simplest form.",
