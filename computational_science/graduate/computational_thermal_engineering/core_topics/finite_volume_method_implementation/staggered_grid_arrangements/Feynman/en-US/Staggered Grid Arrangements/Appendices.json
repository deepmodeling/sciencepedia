            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional incompressible momentum balance in the absence of body forces, written as the semi-discrete finite volume form for the control volume centered at index $i$ on a uniform grid of spacing $\\Delta x$: the net pressure force contribution is approximated as the difference of the pressure at the east and west faces divided by $\\Delta x$. In a collocated arrangement, pressure and velocity are both stored at cell centers, and a common central linear interpolation is used to obtain face pressures. Specifically, let the face pressures be computed by $p_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{i}+p_{i+1}\\right)$ and $p_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{i-1}+p_{i}\\right)$, where $p_{j}$ denotes the pressure at the cell center $x_{j}=j\\,\\Delta x$.

The setup, including the use of central interpolation and the analysis of a high-frequency \"checkerboard\" pressure mode, is a standard textbook example used to illustrate the deficiency of this numerical scheme and the motivation for staggered grids. The principles are firmly based in numerical analysis applied to fluid dynamics.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary definitions and equations to compute the value of $\\Phi_{i}$. The instructions for the qualitative explanation are clear and pertain to established concepts in the field. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Quantitative Computation of $\\Phi_{i}$**\n\nThe objective is to compute the dimensionless pressure force $\\Phi_{i}$ for the given pressure field $p_{j}=p_{0}\\,(-1)^{j}$. The definition of $\\Phi_{i}$ is:\n$$\n\\Phi_{i} = \\frac{-\\left(p_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-p_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right)}{\\Delta x\\,p_{0}}\n$$\nFirst, we use the given central interpolation scheme to compute the pressures at the cell faces, $p_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$ and $p_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}$. The pressure at any cell center $j$ is given by $p_{j} = p_{0}\\,(-1)^{j}$.\n\nThe pressure at the east face, $p_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$, depends on the pressures at cell centers $i$ and $i+1$:\n$$\np_{i} = p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i}\n$$\n$$\np_{i+1} = p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i+1} = p_{0}\\,(-1) \\cdot (-1)^{i} = -p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i}\n$$\nUsing the interpolation formula:\n$$\np_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{i}+p_{i+1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i} + (-p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i})\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(0\\right) = 0\n$$\nNext, the pressure at the west face, $p_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}$, depends on the pressures at cell centers $i-1$ and $i$:\n$$\np_{i-1} = p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i-1} = p_{0}\\,(-1)^{-1} \\cdot (-1)^{i} = -p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i}\n$$\nUsing the interpolation formula:\n$$\np_{i-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(p_{i-1}+p_{i}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i} + p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(0\\right) = 0\n$$\nNow, substitute these face pressures back into the expression for $\\Phi_{i}$:\n$$\n\\Phi_{i} = \\frac{-\\left(0 - 0\\right)}{\\Delta x\\,p_{0}} = \\frac{0}{\\Delta x\\,p_{0}}\n$$\nSince $\\Delta x \\neq 0$ and $p_{0} \\neq 0$ by definition, the result is:\n$$\n\\Phi_{i} = 0\n$$\nThis value is a constant, $0$, and is therefore independent of the index $i$, as required by the problem statement.\n\n**Qualitative Explanation of Spurious Pressure-Velocity Decoupling**\n\nThe pressure gradient term in the momentum equation for cell $i$ is numerically approximated as $-\\frac{p_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-p_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}}{\\Delta x}$. Our calculation shows that for the highly oscillatory, non-uniform pressure field $p_{j} = p_{0}\\,(-1)^{j}$, this discrete pressure gradient is exactly zero for every control volume $i$.\n\nThis outcome is the core of pressure-velocity decoupling. The discrete momentum equation, which governs the velocity field, becomes completely \"blind\" to this particular pressure field. Even though the pressure field exhibits strong cell-to-cell oscillations (a \"checkerboard\" or \"sawtooth\" pattern), the numerical scheme computes a zero pressure gradient everywhere. A zero pressure gradient is what one would compute for a uniform pressure field, $p_j = \\text{constant}$.\n\nTherefore, the velocity field solution does not respond to these high-frequency pressure oscillations. A non-physical, oscillatory pressure field can exist as a spurious numerical artifact without creating any corresponding flow, because the discrete operators fail to link it to the velocity field. This allows for unphysical solutions to satisfy the discretized equations. The pressure and velocity fields are \"decoupled\" in the sense that the velocity is not driven by this non-uniform pressure mode.\n\n**Qualitative Explanation of Why a Staggered Grid Prevents Decoupling**\n\nA staggered grid arrangement, as proposed by Harlow and Welch (the MAC scheme), resolves this issue. In a one-dimensional staggered grid, the scalar quantities like pressure $p$ are stored at the cell centers (e.g., $p_i, p_{i+1}$), while the vector quantities like velocity $u$ are stored at the cell faces (e.g., $u_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}, u_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$).\n\nConsider the momentum equation for the velocity component $u_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$, which is defined on a control volume centered around the face $i+\\frac{1}{2}$. The natural locations for the pressures that drive this velocity are the adjacent cell centers, $i$ and $i+1$. The pressure gradient term is thus approximated directly using these node values, without interpolation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} \\approx \\frac{p_{i+1} - p_{i}}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nLet's evaluate this discrete gradient for the same oscillatory pressure field, $p_{j}=p_{0}\\,(-1)^{j}$:\n$$\np_{i+1} - p_{i} = p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i+1} - p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i} = p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i}(-1 - 1) = -2p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i}\n$$\nThe pressure gradient at the face $i+\\frac{1}{2}$ is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{i+1} - p_{i}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{-2p_{0}\\,(-1)^{i}}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nThis result is non-zero (since $p_0 \\neq 0$). The discrete pressure gradient now correctly \"senses\" the large difference in pressure between adjacent cells. This strong, non-zero gradient will drive a significant velocity response. Because the staggered arrangement creates this tight coupling between the nearest-neighbor pressures and the velocity component located between them, it is impossible for a spurious, oscillatory pressure field to exist without being felt by the velocity field. Any such pressure mode is immediately detected and will influence the flow, preventing the unphysical decoupling seen in the collocated arrangement with central interpolation.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested: interpolation of the scalar field $T$, interpolation of the velocity component $u$, and the consistency analysis for each.\n\n#### 1. Interpolation of Scalar Field $T$ to Velocity Locations\n\n**a) Interpolation of $T$ to the $u$-velocity location $(x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}},y_j)$**\n\nThe target point $(x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}},y_j)$ lies on the horizontal grid line connecting the scalar nodes $(x_i, y_j)$ and $(x_{i+1}, y_j)$. We use linear interpolation between the values $T_{i,j} = T(x_i, y_j)$ and $T_{i+1,j} = T(x_{i+1}, y_j)$. The general formula for linear interpolation of a function $f(x)$ from points $x_a$ and $x_b$ to a point $x_c$ is $f(x_c) = f(x_a)\\frac{x_b-x_c}{x_b-x_a} + f(x_b)\\frac{x_c-x_a}{x_b-x_a}$.\n\nHere, $x_a = x_i$, $x_b = x_{i+1}$, and $x_c = x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$. The problem defines $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2}$.\nThe interpolation weights are:\nWeight for $T_{i,j}$: $\\frac{x_{i+1}-x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}}{x_{i+1}-x_i} = \\frac{x_{i+1}-\\frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2}}{x_{i+1}-x_i} = \\frac{\\frac{x_{i+1}-x_i}{2}}{x_{i+1}-x_i} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nWeight for $T_{i+1,j}$: $\\frac{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-x_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i} = \\frac{\\frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2}-x_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i} = \\frac{\\frac{x_{i+1}-x_i}{2}}{x_{i+1}-x_i} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe interpolated value, denoted $T_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}$, is therefore the arithmetic mean:\n$$T_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} = \\frac{1}{2}T_{i,j} + \\frac{1}{2}T_{i+1,j} = \\frac{T(x_i, y_j) + T(x_{i+1}, y_j)}{2}$$\n\n**b) Interpolation of $T$ to the $v$-velocity location $(x_i,y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})$**\n\nBy analogy, this interpolation is performed along the vertical grid line connecting $(x_i, y_j)$ and $(x_i, y_{j+1})$. Using the definition $y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{y_j+y_{j+1}}{2}$, the interpolation is:\n$$T_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}T_{i,j} + \\frac{1}{2}T_{i,j+1} = \\frac{T(x_i, y_j) + T(x_i, y_{j+1})}{2}$$\n\n#### 2. Interpolation of $u$-velocity to Scalar Face Location $(x_i,y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})$\n\nThe target point $(x_i, y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})$ does not lie on a grid line directly connecting any two $u$-velocity nodes. This requires a bilinear interpolation, which can be performed as two sequential linear interpolations. The four relevant $u$-velocity nodes surrounding the target point are $u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}$, $u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}$, $u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j+1}$, and $u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j+1}$.\n\nStep 1: Interpolate in the $x$-direction to the line $x=x_i$ at elevations $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$.\nLet $\\Delta x_k = x_{k+1}-x_k$. The grid points are $x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{x_{i-1}+x_i}{2}$ and $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{x_i+x_{i+1}}{2}$.\nThe distance from $x_i$ to $x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}$ is $x_i - x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{x_i - x_{i-1}}{2} = \\frac{\\Delta x_{i-1}}{2}$.\nThe distance from $x_i$ to $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$ is $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} - x_i = \\frac{x_{i+1} - x_i}{2} = \\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}$.\nThe total distance is $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} - x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\Delta x_{i-1} + \\Delta x_i}{2}$.\n\nAt $y=y_j$, the interpolated value $u(x_i,y_j)$ is:\n$$u(x_i,y_j) = u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j} \\frac{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-x_i}{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}} + u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} \\frac{x_i-x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}}{x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}-x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}} = u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j} \\frac{\\Delta x_i/2}{(\\Delta x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i)/2} + u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} \\frac{\\Delta x_{i-1}/2}{(\\Delta x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i)/2}$$\n$$u(x_i,y_j) = \\frac{\\Delta x_i}{\\Delta x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i} u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j} + \\frac{\\Delta x_{i-1}}{\\Delta x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i} u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}$$\nSimilarly, at $y=y_{j+1}$:\n$$u(x_i,y_{j+1}) = \\frac{\\Delta x_i}{\\Delta x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i} u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j+1} + \\frac{\\Delta x_{i-1}}{\\Delta x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i} u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j+1}$$\n\nStep 2: Interpolate in the $y$-direction to the point $y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}$. Since $y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}$ is the midpoint between $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$, this is a simple average:\n$$u_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{u(x_i,y_j) + u(x_i,y_{j+1})}{2}$$\nSubstituting the expressions from Step 1 gives the final formula:\n$$u_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\Delta x_i u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j} + \\Delta x_{i-1} u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}}{\\Delta x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta x_i u_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j+1} + \\Delta x_{i-1} u_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j+1}}{\\Delta x_{i-1}+\\Delta x_i}\\right) \\right]$$\n\n#### 3. Truncation Error Analysis and Consistency Order\n\nThe truncation error $\\tau$ is defined as the difference between the interpolated value and the exact value of the continuous field at the target point: $\\tau = \\text{Interpolation} - \\text{Exact}$. The order of consistency $p$ is the lowest power of the characteristic grid spacing $\\Delta$ in the leading term of $\\tau$.\n\n**a) Analysis for $T_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j}$**\nThe target point is $P=(x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}, y_j)$. The truncation error is $\\tau_T = \\frac{1}{2}(T(x_i, y_j) + T(x_{i+1}, y_j)) - T(x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}, y_j)$. Let $\\Delta x_i = x_{i+1}-x_i$. The locations are $x_i = x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} - \\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}$ and $x_{i+1} = x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} + \\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}$.\nWe expand $T(x_i, y_j)$ and $T(x_{i+1}, y_j)$ in a Taylor series around $P$:\n$$T(x_i, y_j) = T|_P - \\left(\\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_P + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}\\right)^2\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_P - \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}\\right)^3\\frac{\\partial^3 T}{\\partial x^3}\\bigg|_P + O((\\Delta x_i)^4)$$\n$$T(x_{i+1}, y_j) = T|_P + \\left(\\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}\\right)\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_P + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}\\right)^2\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_P + \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}\\right)^3\\frac{\\partial^3 T}{\\partial x^3}\\bigg|_P + O((\\Delta x_i)^4)$$\nAveraging these two expansions:\n$$\\frac{T(x_i, y_j) + T(x_{i+1}, y_j)}{2} = T|_P + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}\\right)^2\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_P + O((\\Delta x_i)^4) = T|_P + \\frac{(\\Delta x_i)^2}{8}\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_P + O((\\Delta x_i)^4)$$\nThe truncation error is:\n$$\\tau_T = \\left( T|_P + \\frac{(\\Delta x_i)^2}{8}\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_P \\right) - T|_P + O((\\Delta x_i)^4) = \\frac{(\\Delta x_i)^2}{8}\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_P + O((\\Delta x_i)^4)$$\nThe leading error term is proportional to $(\\Delta x_i)^2$, so the consistency order is $p=2$. By symmetry, the interpolation for $T_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}$ also has a consistency order of $p=2$, with error $\\tau_T = \\frac{(\\Delta y_j)^2}{8}\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2}|_{(x_i, y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})} + O((\\Delta y_j)^4)$.\n\n**b) Analysis for $u_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}}$**\nThe analysis is performed in two steps, mirroring the interpolation procedure.\nLet $Q = (x_i, y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}})$ be the target point.\nStep 1 Error (x-interpolation): The error of the linear interpolation $\\tilde{u}(x_i, y)$ from $u(x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}, y)$ and $u(x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}, y)$ is:\n$$\\tau_x(y) = \\tilde{u}(x_i, y) - u(x_i, y) = -\\frac{(x_i - x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}})(x_i-x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}})}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}(x_i, y) + O(\\Delta x^3)$$\nUsing $x_i-x_{i-\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{\\Delta x_{i-1}}{2}$ and $x_i-x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = -\\frac{\\Delta x_i}{2}$:\n$$\\tau_x(y) = \\frac{\\Delta x_{i-1} \\Delta x_i}{8} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}(x_i, y) + O(\\Delta x^3)$$\nSo, $\\tilde{u}(x_i,y_j) = u(x_i,y_j) + \\tau_x(y_j)$ and $\\tilde{u}(x_i,y_{j+1}) = u(x_i,y_{j+1}) + \\tau_x(y_{j+1})$.\n\nStep 2 Error (y-interpolation): The final interpolated value is $\\tilde{u}_Q = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{u}(x_i,y_j) + \\tilde{u}(x_i,y_{j+1}))$.\n$$\\tilde{u}_Q = \\frac{1}{2}(u(x_i,y_j) + u(x_i,y_{j+1})) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\tau_x(y_j) + \\tau_x(y_{j+1}))$$\nThe first term is the standard linear interpolation of the exact function $u$ from $y_j$ and $y_{j+1}$ to $y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}$. From the analysis for $T$, its error is known:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(u(x_i,y_j) + u(x_i,y_{j+1})) = u(x_i,y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}) + \\frac{(\\Delta y_j)^2}{8} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\bigg|_Q + O(\\Delta y^4)$$\nThe second term involves the error from Step 1. We approximate the average of $\\tau_x$ by its value at the midpoint, which is itself a second-order accurate approximation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(\\tau_x(y_j) + \\tau_x(y_{j+1})) = \\tau_x(y_{j+\\frac{1}{2}}) + O(\\Delta y^2) = \\frac{\\Delta x_{i-1} \\Delta x_i}{8} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_Q + O(\\Delta x^2 \\Delta y^2) + O(\\Delta x^3)$$\nCombining these parts, the total truncation error $\\tau_u = \\tilde{u}_Q - u_Q$ is:\n$$\\tau_u = \\frac{(\\Delta y_j)^2}{8} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\bigg|_Q + \\frac{\\Delta x_{i-1} \\Delta x_i}{8} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_Q + \\text{H.O.T.}$$\nThe leading terms are of order $(\\Delta y_j)^2$ and $(\\Delta x_{i-1}\\Delta x_i)$, which both scale as $\\Delta^2$ for a characteristic grid size $\\Delta$. Thus, the consistency order is $p=2$.\n\n### Conclusion\nAll three specified linear interpolation schemes—$T$ to $u$-locations, $T$ to $v$-locations, and $u$ to scalar face locations—are shown to have a leading truncation error term proportional to the square of the grid spacing. Therefore, the common consistency order for all three interpolations is $p=2$.",
