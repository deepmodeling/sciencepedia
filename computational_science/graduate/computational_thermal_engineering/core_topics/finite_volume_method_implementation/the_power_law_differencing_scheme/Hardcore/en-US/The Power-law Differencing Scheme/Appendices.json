The 1D steady convection-diffusion equation is a canonical model equation, and the power-law scheme is a standard, well-documented differencing scheme in computational heat transfer and fluid dynamics.

It is not trivial, as it requires specific knowledge of the FVM and the power-law scheme formulation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### **Solution**\n\nThe one-dimensional, steady-state convection-diffusion equation for a scalar property $\\phi$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx}(\\rho u A \\phi) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\Gamma A \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right) + S $$\nwhere on the left-hand side is the convective transport term, and on the right-hand side are the diffusive transport and source terms. In the Finite Volume Method (FVM), this equation is integrated over a control volume (CV) around a grid node $P$. For a uniform grid, the CV extends from a west face $w$ to an east face $e$. The integrated equation expresses the balance of fluxes:\n$$ J_e - J_w = \\bar{S} \\, \\Delta V $$\nwhere $J_f$ is the total flux (convection + diffusion) across a face $f$, $\\bar{S}$ is the average source over the CV, and $\\Delta V = A \\Delta x$ is the volume of the CV.\n\nThe core parameters for characterizing the transport across the faces of the control volume are the convective mass flux, $F$, and the diffusive conductance, $D$.\n\n1.  **Convective Mass Flux ($F$)**:\n    This represents the rate of mass flow across a CV face. For constant properties and a uniform grid, it is the same for all faces.\n    $$ F = \\rho u A $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ F = (1) \\times (2) \\times (1) = 2 $$\n\n2.  **Diffusive Conductance ($D$)**:\n    This represents the ease with which the scalar diffuses between adjacent nodes. For a uniform grid, the distance between nodes (e.g., $P$ and $E$) is $\\Delta x$, and the face is located midway.\n    $$ D = \\frac{\\Gamma A}{\\Delta x} $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ D = \\frac{(0.5) \\times (1)}{0.2} = 2.5 $$\n\n3.  **Face Peclet Number ($P$)**:\n    The Peclet number is a dimensionless parameter that represents the ratio of the strength of convection to the strength of diffusion.\n    $$ P = \\frac{F}{D} $$\n    Substituting the calculated values of $F$ and $D$:\n    $$ P = \\frac{2}{2.5} = 0.8 $$\n    As properties are uniform, the Peclet number is the same for all interior faces, $P_e = P_w = P$.\n\n4.  **Power-Law Weighting Function ($f(P)$)**:\n    The power-law differencing scheme approximates the exact exponential solution for 1D convection-diffusion without sources. It modifies the diffusive flux contribution based on the Peclet number to ensure boundedness and improve accuracy over other simple schemes. The weighting function, which we denote here as $f(P)$, is given by the standard formulation:\n    $$ f(P) = A(|P|) = \\max\\left(0, \\left(1 - 0.1|P|\\right)^5\\right) $$\n    The problem asks for $f(P)$, which is this function evaluated at the calculated Peclet number $P=0.8$.\n    $$ f(0.8) = \\max\\left(0, \\left(1 - 0.1|0.8|\\right)^5\\right) = \\left(1 - 0.08\\right)^5 = (0.92)^5 $$\n    Calculating the value:\n    $$ f(0.8) = 0.6590815232 $$\n\n5.  **Neighbor Coefficients ($a_E$ and $a_W$)**:\n    The coefficients $a_E$ and $a_W$ in the discretized equation $a_P \\phi_P = a_W \\phi_W + a_E \\phi_E + b$ relate the influence of the neighbor nodes $W$ and $E$ on the central node $P$. For the power-law scheme, the general expressions for these coefficients are:\n    $$ a_W = D_w A(|P_w|) + \\max(F_w, 0) $$\n    $$ a_E = D_e A(|P_e|) + \\max(-F_e, 0) $$\n    Given that the flow is positive ($u > 0$), the convective flux $F$ is also positive ($F = 2 > 0$). This implies $F_w > 0$ and $F_e > 0$. The expressions simplify to:\n    $$ a_W = D_w A(|P_w|) + F_w $$\n    $$ a_E = D_e A(|P_e|) $$\n    Since the grid and properties are uniform, $D_w = D_e = D = 2.5$, $F_w = F_e = F = 2$, and $A(|P_w|) = A(|P_e|) = f(P) \\approx 0.65908$.\n\n    Now we compute the coefficients:\n    **East coefficient ($a_E$)**:\n    $$ a_E = D \\cdot f(P) = (2.5) \\times (0.6590815232) = 1.647703808 $$\n    **West coefficient ($a_W$)**:\n    $$ a_W = D \\cdot f(P) + F = a_E + F = 1.647703808 + 2 = 3.647703808 $$\n\nFinally, we round all requested quantities to four significant figures.\n*   $F = 2 \\rightarrow 2.000$\n*   $D = 2.5 \\rightarrow 2.500$\n*   $P = 0.8 \\rightarrow 0.8000$\n*   $f(P) = 0.659081... \\rightarrow 0.6591$\n*   $a_E = 1.647703... \\rightarrow 1.648$\n*   $a_W = 3.647703... \\rightarrow 3.648$\n\nThe final answer is reported as a row vector $[F, D, P, f(P), a_{E}, a_{W}]$.",

We apply the Finite Volume Method (FVM) by integrating this equation over a control volume of length $\\Delta x$ and cross-sectional area $A$ centered at a grid node $P$, with neighboring nodes $W$ (west) and $E$ (east).

The faces of the CV are denoted $e$, $w$, $n$, and $s$.\n\n**1. Establish Diffusive Conductance ($D_f$) and Convective Mass Flux ($F_f$)**\n\nThe total flux of a quantity is the sum of its convective and diffusive parts. We analyze these for each face. The grid is uniform with $\\Delta x = \\Delta y$. The depth in the $z$-direction is $1$. The face areas are $A_e = A_w = \\Delta y \\times 1 = \\Delta y$ and $A_n = A_s = \\Delta x \\times 1 = \\Delta x$. Since $\\Delta x = \\Delta y$, all face areas are equal.\n\n**Diffusive Conductance, $D_f$:**\nThe diffusive heat flux through a face $f$ is governed by Fourier's law. For the east face $e$, the flux is approximated as:\n$$ Q_{\\text{diff}, e} = -k A_e \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right)_e \\approx -k A_e \\frac{T_E - T_P}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{k A_e}{\\Delta x} (T_P - T_E) $$\nThe diffusive conductance $D_f$ is defined as the coefficient multiplying the temperature difference.\nFor the east face ($e$): $D_e = \\frac{k A_e}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{k \\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$.\nFor the west face ($w$): $D_w = \\frac{k A_w}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{k \\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$.\nFor the north face ($n$): $D_n = \\frac{k A_n}{\\Delta y} = \\frac{k \\Delta x}{\\Delta y}$.\nFor the south face ($s$): $D_s = \\frac{k A_s}{\\Delta y} = \\frac{k \\Delta x}{\\Delta y}$.\n\n**Convective Mass Flux, $F_f$:**\nThe convective mass flux (or flow rate) through a face $f$ is the product of density, the normal velocity component at the face, and the face area.\n$$ F_f = (\\rho v_n)_f A_f $$\nwhere $v_n$ is the velocity component normal to the face. The velocity field is uniform with components $u$ and $v$.\nFor the east face ($e$): The normal velocity is $u$. $F_e = \\rho u A_e = \\rho u \\Delta y$.\nFor the west face ($w$): The normal velocity is $u$. $F_w = \\rho u A_w = \\rho u \\Delta y$.\nFor the north face ($n$): The normal velocity is $v$. $F_n = \\rho v A_n = \\rho v \\Delta x$.\nFor the south face ($s$): The normal velocity is $v$. $F_s = \\rho v A_s = \\rho v \\Delta x$.\n\n**2. Define and Compute Directional Peclet Numbers ($P_f$)**\n\nThe face Peclet number, $P_f$, is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of the strength of convection to the strength of diffusion. It is defined as:\n$$ P_f = \\frac{F_f}{D_f} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $F_f$ and $D_f$:\n$P_e = \\frac{\\rho u \\Delta y}{k \\Delta y / \\Delta x} = \\frac{\\rho u \\Delta x}{k}$\n$P_w = \\frac{\\rho u \\Delta y}{k \\Delta y / \\Delta x} = \\frac{\\rho u \\Delta x}{k}$\n$P_n = \\frac{\\rho v \\Delta x}{k \\Delta x / \\Delta y} = \\frac{\\rho v \\Delta y}{k}$\n$P_s = \\frac{\\rho v \\Delta x}{k \\Delta x / \\Delta y} = \\frac{\\rho v \\Delta y}{k}$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\rho=1$, $k=1$, $u=1$, $v=0.5$, and $\\Delta x = \\Delta y = 1$.\n$P_e = \\frac{1 \\times 1 \\times 1}{1} = 1$\n$P_w = \\frac{1 \\times 1 \\times 1}{1} = 1$\n$P_n = \\frac{1 \\times 0.5 \\times 1}{1} = 0.5$\n$P_s = \\frac{1 \\times 0.5 \\times 1}{1} = 0.5$\n\n**3. Identify and Compute Power-Law Attenuation Coefficients**\n\nThe power-law differencing scheme provides a specific functional form for the relationship between flux and nodal values, which approximates the exact solution of the $1$-D steady-state convection-diffusion equation. The \"power-law attenuation factor\", which we denote as $\\alpha_f$, is a function of the absolute value of the face Peclet number, $|P_f|$. This coefficient modulates the diffusive contribution to the flux. The standard expression is:\n$$ \\alpha_f = A(|P_f|) = \\max\\left(0, \\left(1 - 0.1 |P_f|\\right)^5\\right) $$\nThis expression is used to calculate the neighbor coefficients in the discretized algebraic equation. For $|P_f| > 10$, the scheme reverts to the upwind differencing scheme, as the term $(1 - 0.1|P_f|)$ becomes negative, and the $\\max$ function yields $0$.\n\nWe compute the attenuation coefficient for each face using the calculated Peclet numbers.\nFor the east face ($e$): $|P_e| = 1$.\n$$ \\alpha_e = \\max\\left(0, \\left(1 - 0.1 \\times 1\\right)^5\\right) = (0.9)^5 = 0.59049 $$\nFor the west face ($w$): $|P_w| = 1$.\n$$ \\alpha_w = \\max\\left(0, \\left(1 - 0.1 \\times 1\\right)^5\\right) = (0.9)^5 = 0.59049 $$\nFor the north face ($n$): $|P_n| = 0.5$.\n$$ \\alpha_n = \\max\\left(0, \\left(1 - 0.1 \\times 0.5\\right)^5\\right) = (1 - 0.05)^5 = (0.95)^5 $$\n$$ \\alpha_n = 0.95 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.95 = 0.7737809375 $$\nFor the south face ($s$): $|P_s| = 0.5$.\n$$ \\alpha_s = \\max\\left(0, \\left(1 - 0.1 \\times 0.5\\right)^5\\right) = (0.95)^5 = 0.7737809375 $$\n\n**4. Final Result Assembly**\n\nThe problem asks for a single row vector containing the eight computed values: the four directional Peclet numbers ($P_e, P_w, P_n, P_s$) and the four power-law attenuation coefficients ($\\alpha_e, \\alpha_w, \\alpha_n, \\alpha_s$).\n\nThe values are:\n$P_e = 1$\n$P_w = 1$\n$P_n = 0.5$\n$P_s = 0.5$\n$\\alpha_e = 0.59049$\n$\\alpha_w = 0.59049$\n$\\alpha_n = 0.7737809375$\n$\\alpha_s = 0.7737809375$\n\nThese eight values will be presented in a single row matrix in the final answer.",
