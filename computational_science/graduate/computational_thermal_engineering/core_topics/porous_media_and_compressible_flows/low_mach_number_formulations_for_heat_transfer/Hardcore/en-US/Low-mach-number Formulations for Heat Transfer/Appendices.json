The fluid is heated uniformly by a volumetric heat source of magnitude $Q$ (energy per unit volume per unit time). Assume constant specific heat capacity at constant pressure $c_p$, constant ideal-gas constant $R$, negligible viscous dissipation, no species diffusion or reactions, and a spatially uniform temperature field so that heat conduction does not contribute ($\\nabla T = \\mathbf{0}$).\n\nStarting from the continuity equation, the ideal-gas equation of state, and the enthalpy-based energy equation with specific enthalpy $h = c_p T$, derive the low-Mach-number divergence constraint and compute the divergence source $S$ such that $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = S$ expressed solely in terms of $Q$, $c_p$, $p_0$, and $R$.\n\nPresent your final expression for $S$ as a single closed-form analytic expression. Express the magnitude of $S$ in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.",
            "solution": "The derivation begins by combining three fundamental equations: the continuity equation, the ideal-gas equation of state, and the energy equation, under the specified assumptions.\n\nThe continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) = 0 $$\nUsing the product rule, this expands to $\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla \\rho = 0$. The problem states that the temperature field is spatially uniform ($\\nabla T = \\mathbf{0}$). Since the pressure is also uniform ($p=p_0$), the density $\\rho = p_0/(RT)$ must also be spatially uniform, meaning $\\nabla \\rho = \\mathbf{0}$. The continuity equation thus simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d\\rho}{dt} + \\rho (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}) = 0 $$\nRearranging gives an expression for the velocity divergence:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} $$\nNext, we differentiate the logarithmic form of the ideal-gas equation of state, $\\ln(p_0) = \\ln(\\rho) + \\ln(R) + \\ln(T)$, with respect to time.

Given the assumptions ($p=p_0$, $\\nabla T = \\mathbf{0}$, $\\Phi=0$, $h=c_pT$), the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{DT}{Dt} = Q $$\nThe material derivative $\\frac{DT}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla T$ simplifies to $\\frac{dT}{dt}$ because $\\nabla T = \\mathbf{0}$ and $T$ becomes a function of time only. The energy equation is therefore:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{dT}{dt} = Q \\implies \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\frac{Q}{\\rho c_p} $$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $\\frac{dT}{dt}$ back into our equation for the velocity divergence:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\frac{Q}{\\rho c_p} \\right) = \\frac{Q}{\\rho c_p T} $$\nTo express this solely in terms of the required variables, we use the ideal-gas law $p_0 = \\rho R T$ to substitute for the product $\\rho T = \\frac{p_0}{R}$.\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{Q}{c_p (p_0/R)} $$\nThis simplifies to the final result for the divergence source $S$:\n$$ S = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{Q R}{c_p p_0} $$\nThe units of this expression are $[Q] [R] / ([c_p] [p_0]) = ([ML^{-1}T^{-3}] [L^2 T^{-2} \\Theta^{-1}]) / ([L^2 T^{-2} \\Theta^{-1}] [ML^{-1}T^{-2}]) = [T^{-1}]$, which is consistent with the units of velocity divergence, $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.",
