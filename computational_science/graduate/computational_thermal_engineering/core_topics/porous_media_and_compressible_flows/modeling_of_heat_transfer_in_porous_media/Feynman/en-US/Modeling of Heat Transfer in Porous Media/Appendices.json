It is a substantive problem requiring derivation and application of established physical models.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\n### Derivation of Series and Parallel Bounds\n\nLet the volume fraction of the fluid phase be $\\varepsilon$ and the volume fraction of the solid phase be $1-\\varepsilon$. The heat flow is considered to be along the $z$-direction without loss of generality, so the macroscopic temperature gradient is $\\nabla T = \\frac{dT}{dz}\\hat{z}$.\n\n**1. Parallel Bound**\nFor the parallel model, the two phases are idealized as being arranged side-by-side, parallel to the direction of the macroscopic temperature gradient. In this arrangement, the temperature gradient is the same across both phases:\n$$ \\nabla T_s = \\nabla T_f = \\nabla T $$\nThe total heat flux, $\\boldsymbol{q}$, is the area-fraction-weighted average of the fluxes in each phase. The area fractions are equal to the volume fractions, $\\varepsilon$ and $1-\\varepsilon$.\n$$ \\boldsymbol{q} = (1-\\varepsilon)\\boldsymbol{q}_s + \\varepsilon\\boldsymbol{q}_f $$\nSubstituting Fourier's law for each phase ($\\boldsymbol{q}_s = -k_s\\nabla T_s$, $\\boldsymbol{q}_f = -k_f\\nabla T_f$) and for the effective medium ($\\boldsymbol{q} = -k_{\\text{eff,p}}\\nabla T$):\n$$ -k_{\\text{eff,p}}\\nabla T = (1-\\varepsilon)(-k_s\\nabla T) + \\varepsilon(-k_f\\nabla T) $$\nDividing by $-\\nabla T$ yields the expression for the parallel-bound effective conductivity, which is an arithmetic mean:\n$$ k_{\\text{eff,p}} = (1-\\varepsilon)k_s + \\varepsilon k_f $$\n\n**2. Series Bound**\nFor the series model, the phases are idealized as layers perpendicular to the direction of heat flow. In this arrangement, the heat flux is constant through each phase and equal to the total flux:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{q}_s = \\boldsymbol{q}_f = \\boldsymbol{q} $$\nThe total temperature drop is the sum of the temperature drops across each phase. This implies the total temperature gradient is the length-fraction-weighted average of the gradients in each phase. The length fractions are equal to the volume fractions.\n$$ \\nabla T = (1-\\varepsilon)\\nabla T_s + \\varepsilon\\nabla T_f $$\nFrom Fourier's law, we express the local gradients in terms of the constant flux $\\boldsymbol{q}$:\n$$ \\nabla T = -\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}}{k_{\\text{eff,s}}}, \\quad \\nabla T_s = -\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}}{k_s}, \\quad \\nabla T_f = -\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}}{k_f} $$\nSubstituting these into the gradient summation equation:\n$$ -\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}}{k_{\\text{eff,s}}} = (1-\\varepsilon)\\left(-\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}}{k_s}\\right) + \\varepsilon\\left(-\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}}{k_f}\\right) $$\nDividing by $-\\boldsymbol{q}$ yields the reciprocal relationship for the series-bound effective conductivity, which is a harmonic mean:\n$$ \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff,s}}} = \\frac{1-\\varepsilon}{k_s} + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{k_f} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{eff,s}} = \\left(\\frac{1-\\varepsilon}{k_s} + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{k_f}\\right)^{-1} $$\nThese two bounds, $k_{\\text{eff,s}}$ and $k_{\\text{eff,p}}$, are known as the Wiener bounds. For any $k_s, k_f > 0$, it can be shown that $k_{\\text{eff,s}} \\leq k_{\\text{eff}} \\leq k_{\\text{eff,p}}$.\n\n### Derivation of the Maxwell–Eucken Expression\n\nThe Maxwell–Eucken model considers a dilute dispersion of spherical inclusions (fluid phase, $k_f$, volume fraction $\\varepsilon$) within a continuous matrix (solid phase, $k_s$). The derivation is extended to finite concentrations using a mean-field argument.\n\n**1. Single Inclusion Problem**\nFirst, we solve for the temperature field around a single spherical inclusion of radius $R$ and conductivity $k_f$ embedded in an infinite matrix of conductivity $k_s$, subject to a uniform far-field temperature gradient $\\boldsymbol{E}_0 = -\\nabla T_0$. The governing equation is the steady heat equation, $\\nabla^2 T = 0$. In spherical coordinates with $\\boldsymbol{E}_0$ along the $z$-axis, the solutions for the temperature inside the inclusion ($T_f$) and outside in the matrix ($T_s$) take the form:\n$$ T_f(r, \\theta) = -A r \\cos\\theta \\quad (r \\le R) $$\n$$ T_s(r, \\theta) = -E_0 r \\cos\\theta + \\frac{B}{r^2} \\cos\\theta \\quad (r \\ge R) $$\nThe boundary conditions at the interface $r=R$ are continuity of temperature, $T_f(R, \\theta) = T_s(R, \\theta)$, and continuity of normal heat flux, $-k_f \\frac{\\partial T_f}{\\partial r} = -k_s \\frac{\\partial T_s}{\\partial r}$. These lead to a system of equations for the coefficients $A$ and $B$. The result for the temperature gradient field inside the inclusion is that it is uniform and given by:\n$$ \\nabla T_f = A \\hat{z} = \\frac{3k_s}{k_f+2k_s} \\nabla T_0 $$\n\n**2. Mean-Field Extension (Clausius-Mossotti Relation)**\nTo extend this to a finite concentration $\\varepsilon$, we use a mean-field approach. The effective conductivity $k_{\\text{eff}}$ is related to the average heat flux $\\langle\\boldsymbol{q}\\rangle$ and the average temperature gradient $\\langle\\nabla T\\rangle$ by $\\langle\\boldsymbol{q}\\rangle = -k_{\\text{eff}}\\langle\\nabla T\\rangle$.\nThe average flux can also be written in terms of a thermal \"polarization\" $\\boldsymbol{P}_T$, which represents the density of induced thermal dipoles:\n$$ \\langle\\boldsymbol{q}\\rangle = -k_s\\langle\\nabla T\\rangle - \\boldsymbol{P}_T \\implies \\boldsymbol{P}_T = -(k_{\\text{eff}} - k_s)\\langle\\nabla T\\rangle $$\nThe polarization is also the number density of inclusions, $n = \\varepsilon/V_{\\text{sphere}}$, times the average dipole moment $\\langle\\boldsymbol{p}_T\\rangle$ of a single inclusion: $\\boldsymbol{P}_T = n \\langle\\boldsymbol{p}_T\\rangle$.\nThe dipole moment of an inclusion is related to its \"polarizability\" $\\alpha_T$ and the local field it experiences, $\\nabla T_{\\text{loc}}$: $\\boldsymbol{p}_T = \\alpha_T \\nabla T_{\\text{loc}}$. The polarizability for a sphere is found from the single-inclusion solution to be $\\alpha_T = 3V_{\\text{sphere}}k_s \\frac{k_f-k_s}{k_f+2k_s}$.\nThe mean-field part of the argument lies in relating the local field to the average field. Using the Lorentz argument for a spherical cavity, the local field is:\n$$ \\nabla T_{\\text{loc}} = \\langle\\nabla T\\rangle - \\frac{\\boldsymbol{P}_T}{3k_s} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\boldsymbol{P}_T$ in terms of $k_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ \\nabla T_{\\text{loc}} = \\langle\\nabla T\\rangle - \\frac{-(k_{\\text{eff}}-k_s)\\langle\\nabla T\\rangle}{3k_s} = \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}-k_s}{3k_s}\\right)\\langle\\nabla T\\rangle = \\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}+2k_s}{3k_s}\\langle\\nabla T\\rangle $$\nCombining these relations:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{P}_T = n \\alpha_T \\nabla T_{\\text{loc}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{V_{\\text{sphere}}} \\left(3V_{\\text{sphere}}k_s \\frac{k_f-k_s}{k_f+2k_s}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}+2k_s}{3k_s}\\langle\\nabla T\\rangle\\right) $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{P}_T = \\varepsilon \\frac{k_f-k_s}{k_f+2k_s} (k_{\\text{eff}}+2k_s) \\langle\\nabla T\\rangle $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\boldsymbol{P}_T$:\n$$ -(k_{\\text{eff}} - k_s)\\langle\\nabla T\\rangle = \\varepsilon (k_f-k_s) \\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}+2k_s}{k_f+2k_s} \\langle\\nabla T\\rangle $$\nThis simplifies to the Clausius-Mossotti relation (also known as the Maxwell-Garnett relation in this context):\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}-k_s}{k_{\\text{eff}}+2k_s} = \\varepsilon \\frac{k_f-k_s}{k_f+2k_s} $$\nTo obtain the Maxwell-Eucken expression, we solve for $k_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ k_{\\text{eff}}(k_f+2k_s) - k_s(k_f+2k_s) = \\varepsilon(k_f-k_s)(k_{\\text{eff}}+2k_s) $$\n$$ k_{\\text{eff}}\\left[k_f+2k_s - \\varepsilon(k_f-k_s)\\right] = k_s(k_f+2k_s) + 2\\varepsilon k_s(k_f-k_s) $$\n$$ k_{\\text{eff}} = k_s \\frac{(k_f+2k_s) + 2\\varepsilon(k_f-k_s)}{(k_f+2k_s) - \\varepsilon(k_f-k_s)} $$\nThis is the Maxwell-Eucken expression for spherical inclusions (phase $f$) in a continuous matrix (phase $s$).\n\n### Numerical Calculations\n\nGiven the parameters $k_s = 5$, $k_f = 0.026$, and $\\varepsilon = 0.70$.\n\n**1. Series Bound ($k_{\\text{eff,s}}$):**\n$$ k_{\\text{eff,s}} = \\left(\\frac{1-0.70}{5} + \\frac{0.70}{0.026}\\right)^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{0.3}{5} + \\frac{0.7}{0.026}\\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{eff,s}} = (0.06 + 26.92307...)^{-1} = (26.98307...)^{-1} \\approx 0.037060... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $k_{\\text{eff,s}} = 0.03706\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\n**2. Parallel Bound ($k_{\\text{eff,p}}$):**\n$$ k_{\\text{eff,p}} = (1-0.70)(5) + (0.70)(0.026) = (0.3)(5) + (0.7)(0.026) $$\n$$ k_{\\text{eff,p}} = 1.5 + 0.0182 = 1.5182 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $k_{\\text{eff,p}} = 1.518\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\n**3. Maxwell-Eucken Prediction ($k_{\\text{eff,M}}$):**\n$$ k_{\\text{eff,M}} = k_s \\frac{k_f+2k_s + 2\\varepsilon(k_f-k_s)}{k_f+2k_s - \\varepsilon(k_f-k_s)} $$\nFirst, compute the intermediate terms:\n$$ k_f-k_s = 0.026 - 5 = -4.974 $$\n$$ k_f+2k_s = 0.026 + 2(5) = 10.026 $$\nNow, substitute these into the expression:\n$$ k_{\\text{eff,M}} = 5 \\times \\frac{10.026 + 2(0.70)(-4.974)}{10.026 - (0.70)(-4.974)} = 5 \\times \\frac{10.026 - 6.9636}{10.026 + 3.4818} $$\n$$ k_{\\text{eff,M}} = 5 \\times \\frac{3.0624}{13.5078} \\approx 5 \\times 0.22671... = 1.13356... $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $k_{\\text{eff,M}} = 1.134\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\n### Discussion of Bounds\n\nThe calculated values are the series bound $0.03706\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, the parallel bound $1.518\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, and the Maxwell-Eucken prediction $1.134\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n\nThe parallel bound is significantly \"tighter,\" or more representative of the material's actual behavior, than the series bound. This is a direct consequence of the material's microstructure and the large contrast in phase conductivities. The problem describes a continuous solid matrix, which is the high-conductivity phase ($k_s/k_f \\approx 192$), with dispersed pores of low-conductivity gas.\n\nThe parallel model idealizes the material as having continuous, parallel pathways for heat flow through both the solid and fluid phases. Because the solid phase is highly conductive and continuous, it provides an efficient \"bridge\" for heat transfer across the material. This microstructural arrangement is conceptually closer to a parallel connection of conductors than a series one.\n\nConversely, the series model represents a worst-case scenario. It assumes the two phases are layered such that all heat must pass sequentially through both the high-conductivity solid and the low-conductivity, insulating gas. This would create a severe thermal bottleneck, which is not representative of a foam with a continuous solid skeleton. The extremely low value of the series bound reflects this physically unrealistic bottleneck.\n\nThe Maxwell-Eucken model, which explicitly accounts for a continuous matrix and dispersed inclusions, yields a value much closer to the parallel bound than the series bound. This confirms that for a high-contrast composite where the high-conductivity phase is continuous, the effective conductivity is controlled more by the parallel-like pathways and is closer to the upper Wiener bound. The significant gap between the bounds themselves is a hallmark of a large conductivity contrast between the constituent phases.",

A single-phase fluid of density $\\rho_{f}$ and specific heat capacity at constant pressure $c_{p,f}$ flows steadily in the $+x$ direction through the porous skeleton with constant Darcy (superficial) velocity $u$. The porous medium and the fluid are assumed to be in Local Thermal Equilibrium (LTE), with a single volume-averaged temperature field $T(x)$, and the mixture exhibits a constant effective thermal conductivity $k_{\\text{eff}}$. Inside the slab there is uniform volumetric heat generation $q'''$ (for example, due to an exothermic reaction in the solid matrix), spatially and temporally constant. Viscous dissipation, axial dispersion beyond Fourier conduction, radiation, and property variations are negligible.\n\nStarting from conservation of energy for a Representative Elementary Volume (REV) under LTE, model the one-dimensional steady temperature field $T(x)$ resulting from the combined effects of Darcy advection and effective conduction with internal generation.

            "solution": "The problem statement is reviewed and validated. It constitutes a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in heat transfer. All necessary data, conditions, and definitions are provided, and no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness are present. The problem is a standard one in transport phenomena and is suitable for analytical treatment.\n\nThe physical system is a one-dimensional porous slab with steady fluid flow, uniform internal heat generation, and specified boundary conditions. The temperature field $T(x)$ is governed by the steady-state energy conservation equation, which accounts for both advective and conductive heat transfer.\n\nWe begin by performing an energy balance on a differential control volume element of the porous medium, having a cross-sectional area $A$ normal to the flow and a thickness $dx$ in the direction of flow. For steady-state conditions, the rate of energy entering the control volume must balance the rate of energy leaving, plus any energy generated within the volume.\n\nThe energy balance equation is:\n$$\n\\dot{E}_{\\text{in}} - \\dot{E}_{\\text{out}} + \\dot{E}_{\\text{gen}} = 0\n$$\n\nThe terms are as follows:\n-   Advective energy flux in at $x$: $(\\rho_f c_{p,f} u A) T(x)$\n-   Advective energy flux out at $x+dx$: $(\\rho_f c_{p,f} u A) T(x+dx)$\n-   Conductive heat flux in at $x$: $-k_{\\text{eff}} A \\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_x$\n-   Conductive heat flux out at $x+dx$: $-k_{\\text{eff}} A \\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_{x+dx}$\n-   Volumetric heat generation: $q''' (A \\, dx)$\n\nCombining these terms into the balance equation:\n$$\n(\\rho_f c_{p,f} u A) T(x) - (\\rho_f c_{p,f} u A) T(x+dx) - k_{\\text{eff}} A \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_x - \\left(-k_{\\text{eff}} A \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x+dx}\\right) + q''' A \\, dx = 0\n$$\nDividing by the volume of the element, $A \\, dx$, and rearranging terms:\n$$\n-\\rho_f c_{p,f} u \\frac{T(x+dx)-T(x)}{dx} + k_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_{x+dx} - \\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_x\\right)}{dx} + q''' = 0\n$$\nTaking the limit as $dx \\to 0$, we obtain the governing second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the temperature field $T(x)$:\n$$\n-\\rho_f c_{p,f} u \\frac{dT}{dx} + k_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} + q''' = 0\n$$\nRearranging into a standard form:\n$$\nk_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} - (\\rho_f c_{p,f} u) \\frac{dT}{dx} + q''' = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order, linear, non-homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The general solution $T(x)$ is the sum of a homogeneous solution $T_h(x)$ and a particular solution $T_p(x)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n$$\nk_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{d^2T_h}{dx^2} - (\\rho_f c_{p,f} u) \\frac{dT_h}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThe characteristic equation is $k_{\\text{eff}} r^2 - (\\rho_f c_{p,f} u) r = 0$, which has roots $r_1=0$ and $r_2 = \\frac{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u}{k_{\\text{eff}}}$.\nThe homogeneous solution is therefore:\n$$\nT_h(x) = C_1 e^{0 \\cdot x} + C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u x}{k_{\\text{eff}}}\\right) = C_1 + C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u x}{k_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)\n$$\nFor the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term $q'''$ is a constant and the homogeneous solution contains a constant term, we assume a solution of the form $T_p(x) = Bx$. Substituting this into the full ODE:\n$$\nk_{\\text{eff}}(0) - (\\rho_f c_{p,f} u)(B) + q''' = 0 \\implies B = \\frac{q'''}{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u}\n$$\nSo, the particular solution is $T_p(x) = \\frac{q''' x}{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u}$. This holds for $u \\neq 0$.\n\nThe general solution for $T(x)$ is:\n$$\nT(x) = C_1 + C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u x}{k_{\\text{eff}}}\\right) + \\frac{q''' x}{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u}\n$$\nWe now apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nBoundary Condition 1: $T(0) = T_{\\text{in}}$\n$$\nT(0) = C_1 + C_2 \\exp(0) + 0 = C_1 + C_2 = T_{\\text{in}} \\implies C_1 = T_{\\text{in}} - C_2\n$$\nBoundary Condition 2: $\\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_{x=L} = 0$.

The governing ODE simplifies to $k_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} + q''' = 0$.\nIntegrating twice yields $T(x) = -\\frac{q''' x^2}{2 k_{\\text{eff}}} + A_1 x + A_2$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n$T(0) = T_{\\text{in}} \\implies A_2 = T_{\\text{in}}$.\n$\\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_{x=L} = -\\frac{q''' L}{k_{\\text{eff}}} + A_1 = 0 \\implies A_1 = \\frac{q''' L}{k_{\\text{eff}}}$.\nThe pure conduction solution is $T(x) = T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{q'''}{k_{\\text{eff}}} \\left( L x - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right)$.\nTo confirm our general solution converges to this, we take the limit as $u \\to 0$. Let $z = \\frac{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u}{k_{\\text{eff}}}$. As $u \\to 0$, $z \\to 0$. We use Taylor series $\\exp(y) \\approx 1+y+y^2/2$.\nThe general solution involves terms like $\\frac{1}{u}$ and $\\frac{1}{u^2}$, which require careful evaluation using L'Hôpital's rule or Taylor expansion. The expansion of the exponential term in the solution yields:\n$$ \\lim_{u\\to 0} T(x) = T_{\\text{in}} + \\lim_{z\\to 0} \\left( \\frac{q''' x}{z k_{\\text{eff}}} + \\frac{q'''}{z^2 k_{\\text{eff}}} \\left[ \\exp(-zL) - \\exp(z(x-L)) \\right] \\right) $$\n$$ = T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{q'''}{k_{\\text{eff}}} \\lim_{z\\to 0} \\frac{zx + (1-zL+\\frac{z^2L^2}{2}) - (1+z(x-L)+\\frac{z^2(x-L)^2}{2})}{z^2} $$\n$$ = T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{q'''}{k_{\\text{eff}}} \\lim_{z\\to 0} \\frac{zx -zL - zx + zL + z^2(\\frac{L^2}{2} - \\frac{(x-L)^2}{2})}{z^2} = T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{q'''}{k_{\\text{eff}}} \\left( Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right) $$\nThe limit correctly reproduces the pure conduction solution.\n\n**Limiting Case 2: Pure Advection ($k_{\\text{eff}} \\to 0$)**\nIn this limit, conduction vanishes. The governing equation becomes a first-order ODE: $-\\rho_f c_{p,f} u \\frac{dT}{dx} + q''' = 0$.\nSuch an equation can only satisfy one boundary condition. As information flows downstream with the fluid, the upstream condition $T(0)=T_{\\text{in}}$ is the relevant one. Solving $\\frac{dT}{dx} = \\frac{q'''}{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u}$ with this condition gives:\n$T(x) = T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{q''' x}{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u}$.\nNow, we examine the limit of our general solution as $k_{\\text{eff}} \\to 0$. This corresponds to the exponent argument $\\frac{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u}{k_{\\text{eff}}} \\to \\infty$ (for $u>0$).\nIn the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u (x-L)}{k_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)$, the argument is negative for $x<L$ and zero for $x=L$. Thus, as $k_{\\text{eff}} \\to 0$, this exponential term tends to $0$ for all $x \\in [0,L)$. At $x=L$, it is $1$.\nThe term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u L}{k_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)$ also tends to $0$.\nThe pre-factor $\\frac{q''' k_{\\text{eff}}}{(\\rho_f c_{p,f} u)^2}$ also tends to $0$.\nThe entire last term of the solution vanishes in the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{k_{\\text{eff}}\\to 0} \\left( \\frac{q''' k_{\\text{eff}}}{(\\rho_f c_{p,f} u)^2} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\dots\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\dots\\right) \\right] \\right) = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the general solution reduces to:\n$$\n\\lim_{k_{\\text{eff}}\\to 0} T(x) = T_{\\text{in}} + \\frac{q''' x}{\\rho_f c_{p,f} u}\n$$\nThis limit correctly reproduces the pure advection solution. The downstream, no-flux boundary condition, which is a condition on the conductive flux, becomes irrelevant as conduction itself vanishes.\nThe derived solution is robust and physically consistent in both advection-dominated and conduction-dominated regimes.",
