            "solution": "The problem requires an assessment of the physical admissibility of a measured intrinsic permeability tensor, $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{meas}}$, within the framework of Darcy's law for creeping flow in a porous medium. This assessment is based on fundamental principles of linear irreversible thermodynamics and dimensional analysis. The analysis will proceed through the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nThe measured permeability tensor is given as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{meas}} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.2 \\times 10^{-12} & 3.0 \\times 10^{-13} \\\\\n2.7 \\times 10^{-13} & 0.8 \\times 10^{-12}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\ \\text{m}^{2}\n$$\nFor computational convenience, we express all components with a common factor of $10^{-12}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{meas}} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.2 & 0.3 \\\\\n0.27 & 0.8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\times 10^{-12} \\ \\text{m}^{2}\n$$\n\n**1. Justification of Symmetry and Positive Definiteness, and Construction of $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{s}}$**\n\nDarcy's law provides a linear relationship between the thermodynamic flux (superficial velocity, $\\mathbf{u}$) and the thermodynamic force (the negative gradient of the hydraulic potential, $-\\nabla p^*$, where $p^* = p - \\rho \\mathbf{g} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}$ for pressure $p$, fluid density $\\rho$, and gravitational acceleration $\\mathbf{g}$):\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\mathbf{K} \\cdot (-\\nabla p^*)\n$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\mathbf{K}$ is the intrinsic permeability tensor.\n\n**Symmetry**: Within the theory of linear irreversible thermodynamics, for processes near thermodynamic equilibrium and in the absence of external magnetic fields or Coriolis forces, the matrix of phenomenological coefficients linking fluxes and forces must be symmetric. This is a statement of the Onsager reciprocal relations. The permeability tensor $\\mathbf{K}$ is such a matrix of coefficients. Therefore, for flow in a static porous medium, the physically correct intrinsic permeability tensor must be symmetric, i.e., $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{K}^\\text{T}$.\n\n**Positive Definiteness**: The second law of thermodynamics requires that the rate of local entropy production, or equivalently the rate of mechanical energy dissipation per unit volume ($\\mathcal{D}$), must be non-negative. For viscous flow, this dissipation must be strictly positive for any non-zero flow. The dissipation rate is given by the product of the flux and the force:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} = \\mathbf{u} \\cdot (-\\nabla p^*) \\ge 0\n$$\nSubstituting Darcy's law:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\mathbf{K} \\cdot (-\\nabla p^*) \\right) \\cdot (-\\nabla p^*) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} (\\nabla p^*)^\\text{T} \\mathbf{K} (\\nabla p^*)\n$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$, for $\\mathcal{D}$ to be strictly positive for any non-zero driving force $\\nabla p^* \\ne \\mathbf{0}$, the quadratic form $(\\nabla p^*)^\\text{T} \\mathbf{K} (\\nabla p^*)$ must be positive. This is the definition of a positive definite tensor $\\mathbf{K}$.\n\nThe measured tensor $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{meas}}$ is not symmetric. The physically relevant part is its symmetric component, $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{s}}$, which represents the true material property, with the non-symmetric part attributed to experimental error.

Evaluation of the Antisymmetric Part $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{a}}$**\n\nThe antisymmetric (or skew-symmetric) part, $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{a}}$, is calculated as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{a}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{meas}} - \\mathbf{K}_{\\text{meas}}^\\text{T})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{a}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.3 \\\\ 0.27 & 0.8 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.27 \\\\ 0.3 & 0.8 \\end{pmatrix} \\right] \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\text{m}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{a}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.03 \\\\ -0.03 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\text{m}^{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0.015 \\\\ -0.015 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\text{m}^{2}\n$$\nThe non-zero antisymmetric part $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{a}}$ indicates a violation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. Physically, it has no contribution to energy dissipation since for any vector $\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{x}^\\text{T} \\mathbf{K}_{\\text{a}} \\mathbf{x} = 0$. Its presence in experimental data for this system is unphysical and is interpreted as measurement error. The relative magnitude of the off-diagonal element of $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{a}}$ ($0.015$) compared to that of $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{s}}$ ($0.285$) is about $5.3\\%$, suggesting a small but non-negligible experimental discrepancy.\n\n**3. Test of Positive Definiteness via Eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{s}}$**\n\nA symmetric matrix is positive definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are strictly positive. We compute the eigenvalues, $\\lambda$, of $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{s}}$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{s}} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$. For clarity, we operate on the numerical part of the tensor and re-apply the scaling factor at the end. Let the matrix be $\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.2 & 0.285 \\\\ 0.285 & 0.8 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\n\\det(\\mathbf{M} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = \\begin{vmatrix} 1.2 - \\lambda & 0.285 \\\\ 0.285 & 0.8 - \\lambda \\end{vmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(1.2 - \\lambda)(0.8 - \\lambda) - (0.285)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - (1.2 + 0.8)\\lambda + (1.2)(0.8) - 0.081225 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - 2.0\\lambda + 0.96 - 0.081225 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - 2.0\\lambda + 0.878775 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{2.0 \\pm \\sqrt{(-2.0)^2 - 4(1)(0.878775)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{2.0 \\pm \\sqrt{4.0 - 3.5151}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{2.0 \\pm \\sqrt{0.4849}}{2} = \\frac{2.0 \\pm 0.6963476}{2}\n$$\nThe two eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\frac{2.0 + 0.6963476}{2} \\approx 1.3481738\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = \\frac{2.0 - 0.6963476}{2} \\approx 0.6518262\n$$\nBoth eigenvalues are positive, so the symmetric tensor $\\mathbf{K}_{\\text{s}}$ is positive definite. The smallest eigenvalue serves as a scalar diagnostic of admissibility. It represents the minimum possible permeability in any direction.\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{min}} = \\lambda_2 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\text{m}^{2} \\approx 0.6518262 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\text{m}^{2}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.6518 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\text{m}^{2}$, or $6.518 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\text{m}^{2}$.\n\n**4. Dimensional Consistency Verification**\n\nLet $[\\cdot]$ denote the dimensions of a quantity in terms of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$).\nThe dimensions of the terms in Darcy's law, $\\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{K}}{\\mu} \\nabla p$, are:\n- Velocity $\\mathbf{u}$: $[\\text{u}] = L T^{-1}$\n- Dynamic viscosity $\\mu$: $[\\mu] = M L^{-1} T^{-1}$\n- Pressure $p$: $[p] = \\text{Force/Area} = (M L T^{-2}) / L^2 = M L^{-1} T^{-2}$\n- Pressure gradient $\\nabla p$: $[\\nabla p] = [p]/L = M L^{-2} T^{-2}$\n\nFrom Darcy's law, we equate the dimensions:\n$$\n[u] = \\frac{[\\mathbf{K}]}{[\\mu]} [\\nabla p]\n$$\n$$\nL T^{-1} = \\frac{[\\mathbf{K}]}{M L^{-1} T^{-1}} M L^{-2} T^{-2} = [\\mathbf{K}] L^{-1} T^{-1}\n$$\nSolving for the dimensions of permeability $[\\mathbf{K}]$:\n$$\n[\\mathbf{K}] = \\frac{L T^{-1}}{L^{-1} T^{-1}} = L^2\n$$\nThus, intrinsic permeability has dimensions of area. The given unit of $\\text{m}^2$ is dimensionally correct.\n\n**5. Consequences of Violations**\n\n- **Violation of Symmetry**: A non-symmetric permeability tensor, if not attributed to error, implies physics beyond the scope of the Onsager relations, such as the presence of a Hall effect analogue, which is not expected in this context. Computationally, it makes the discrete system matrix non-symmetric, requiring more complex and costly iterative solvers (e.g., GMRES, BiCGSTAB) compared to the efficient Conjugate Gradient method applicable to symmetric positive definite systems.\n\n- **Violation of Positive Definiteness**: A non-positive definite permeability tensor is a catastrophic physical violation. If an eigenvalue is negative, it implies that flow can be generated against a pressure gradient, creating energy from nothing and violating the second law of thermodynamics. Such a system would be physically unstable. Computationally, the governing PDE for pressure would no longer be elliptic, and the corresponding stiffness matrix would be non-positive-definite. This leads to ill-posed problems with no unique stable solution, and numerical simulations would diverge or yield meaningless results.\n\n- **Violation of Unit Consistency**: Using incorrect units is a fundamental modeling error. It makes the governing equations dimensionally inhomogeneous, and any numerical output would be physically meaningless as it would not quantitatively represent the intended physical system.\n\nIn conclusion, the measured tensor shows a slight deviation from symmetry, attributable to experimental error. Its symmetric part is positive definite, confirming its physical admissibility from a thermodynamic standpoint. The units are consistent with the physical definition of intrinsic permeability. The smallest eigenvalue of the symmetric tensor is $\\lambda_{\\text{min}} \\approx 6.518 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\text{m}^2$.",

            "problem": "Consider a homogeneous, isotropic porous medium occupying the half-space $y \\geq 0$ adjacent to an impermeable solid wall at $y = 0$. A steady, isothermal, incompressible flow of a Newtonian fluid is driven along the $x$-direction by a uniform macroscopic pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$, assumed constant in space and time. The fluid has dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ and the porous medium has scalar permeability $K$. The flow is sufficiently slow that inertial effects are negligible. The volumetric-averaged axial velocity is $u(y)$, depending only on the wall-normal coordinate $y$.\n\nStarting from conservation of linear momentum and the well-tested porous-media extension that adds a viscous diffusion term to account for near-wall shear within the pore space, derive the governing ordinary differential equation for $u(y)$, impose physically consistent boundary conditions at $y=0$ and $y \\to \\infty$, and solve for the velocity profile $u(y)$.\n\nThen, critically assess what would be implied by applying the original form of Darcy’s law alone under the same conditions, and explain whether an exponential near-wall decay can or cannot be obtained without the viscous diffusion term.

No numerical evaluation is required. If you introduce any characteristic length scales, define them explicitly from the governing equation. The final answer must be the velocity profile expression. Units should not be included in the final expression; however, all dimensional quantities in the derivation should be assigned their standard physical units.",
            "solution": "The analysis begins with the conservation of linear momentum for a steady, incompressible, slow flow in a porous medium. The problem specifies that in addition to the standard porous drag force (the Darcy term), a viscous diffusion term must be included. This leads to the Brinkman equation, which for this flow configuration represents the momentum balance in the $x$-direction. The general form of the Brinkman equation is:\n$$ -\\nabla p - \\frac{\\mu}{K} \\mathbf{u} + \\mu_{eff} \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\nwhere $p$ is the macroscopic pressure, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the volume-averaged (Darcy) velocity, $\\mu$ is the fluid's dynamic viscosity, $K$ is the permeability of the porous medium, and $\\mu_{eff}$ is an effective viscosity. It is a common and reasonable assumption for a homogeneous porous medium to take the effective viscosity equal to the fluid viscosity, i.e., $\\mu_{eff} = \\mu$.\n\nThe flow is purely in the $x$-direction and varies only with $y$, so the velocity vector is $\\mathbf{u} = (u(y), 0, 0)$. The pressure gradient is given as a constant, $\\nabla p = (\\frac{dp}{dx}, 0, 0)$. The Laplacian operator acting on $\\mathbf{u}$ simplifies to $\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} = (\\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2}, 0, 0)$.\n\nSubstituting these forms into the $x$-component of the Brinkman equation yields the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the velocity profile $u(y)$:\n$$ -\\frac{dp}{dx} - \\frac{\\mu}{K} u(y) + \\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order, linear, non-homogeneous ODE. Rearranging it into a standard form gives:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} - \\frac{\\mu}{K} u(y) = \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nDividing by the fluid viscosity $\\mu$ gives:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} - \\frac{1}{K} u(y) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\n\nNext, we establish the boundary conditions.\n1.  At the solid, impermeable wall at $y=0$, the fluid velocity must be zero. This is the no-slip condition.\n    $$ u(0) = 0 $$\n2.  Far from the wall, as $y \\to \\infty$, the influence of the wall's shear stress must vanish. In this region, the viscous diffusion term $\\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2}$ becomes negligible. The flow is then governed by a balance between the pressure gradient and the porous drag, which is precisely the statement of Darcy's law. The momentum equation simplifies to:\n    $$ -\\frac{dp}{dx} - \\frac{\\mu}{K} u_{\\infty} = 0 $$\n    This defines the far-field velocity, which the problem statement denotes as $u_{D,\\infty}$:\n    $$ u(y \\to \\infty) = u_{D,\\infty} = -\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\n    For flow to occur in the positive $x$-direction ($u > 0$), the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ must be negative. The resulting $u_{D,\\infty}$ is a positive constant.\n\nWe now solve the ODE subject to these boundary conditions. The general solution $u(y)$ is the sum of a particular solution $u_p(y)$ and the homogeneous solution $u_h(y)$.\nThe right-hand side of the ODE is constant, so we seek a constant particular solution, $u_p(y) = C$. Substituting into the ODE:\n$$ \\frac{d^2}{dy^2}(C) - \\frac{1}{K} C = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\implies 0 - \\frac{C}{K} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nSolving for $C$ yields the particular solution:\n$$ u_p(y) = C = -\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} = u_{D,\\infty} $$\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u_h}{dy^2} - \\frac{1}{K} u_h(y) = 0 $$\nThis has a characteristic equation $r^2 - \\frac{1}{K} = 0$, with roots $r_{1,2} = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{K}}$. The homogeneous solution is thus:\n$$ u_h(y) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right) $$\nFrom the structure of the ODE, we can identify a characteristic length scale $\\delta = \\sqrt{K}$, often called the Brinkman screening length. This length scale determines the thickness of the boundary layer near the wall.\n\nThe full general solution is $u(y) = u_h(y) + u_p(y)$:\n$$ u(y) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right) - \\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions to determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nApplying the far-field condition, $u(y \\to \\infty) = u_{D,\\infty} = -\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}$:\n$$ \\lim_{y \\to \\infty} \\left[ C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right) - \\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\right] = -\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nAs $y \\to \\infty$, the term $\\exp\\left(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right)$ grows without bound, while $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right)$ decays to zero. For the solution to remain physically bounded, the coefficient of the growing exponential term must be zero. Therefore, $C_1 = 0$.\n\nThe solution simplifies to:\n$$ u(y) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right) - \\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nApplying the no-slip condition at the wall, $u(0) = 0$:\n$$ u(0) = C_2 \\exp(0) - \\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} = 0 \\implies C_2 - \\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} = 0 $$\n$$ C_2 = \\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\n\nSubstituting the value of $C_2$ back into the solution gives the final expression for the velocity profile:\n$$ u(y) = \\left(\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right) - \\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nFactoring out the constant term $-\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}$:\n$$ u(y) = -\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{K}}\\right) \\right) $$\n\n### Critical Assessment of Darcy's Law\n\nThe problem asks what would be implied by applying the original form of Darcy's law alone under the same conditions. Darcy's law is an algebraic relation between velocity and pressure gradient:\n$$ \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\nabla p $$\nFor the given one-dimensional flow driven by a constant pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$, this law would predict:\n$$ u(y) = -\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} = \\text{constant} $$\nThis result implies that the velocity is uniform across the entire half-space $y \\geq 0$. This poses a significant physical inconsistency: it fails to satisfy the no-slip boundary condition $u(0)=0$ at the solid wall. Darcy's law, being a first-order model (in terms of spatial derivatives of pressure), lacks the mathematical structure (it's not a differential equation for velocity) to incorporate boundary conditions on the velocity itself. It fundamentally describes bulk flow far from boundaries and cannot capture the physics of the boundary layer where viscous shear stresses are dominant.\n\nThe question of whether an exponential near-wall decay can be obtained without the viscous diffusion term can now be answered. The answer is unequivocally no. The exponential term $\\exp(-y/\\sqrt{K})$ in the solution arises directly from the homogeneous solution of the second-order differential equation. The second-derivative term, $\\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2}$, is precisely the viscous diffusion term requested by the problem statement. Without this term, the governing equation degenerates from a differential equation to the algebraic Darcy relation, which yields only a constant velocity. The exponential decay is therefore a direct mathematical and physical consequence of including viscous diffusion, which models the transmission of shear from the stationary wall into the fluid.",

Let $u_c$ be the critical superficial velocity at which this transition occurs.\n$$\n(\\text{Viscous Term}) = (\\text{Inertial Term})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu}{k} u_c = \\rho \\beta u_c^2\n$$\nAssuming $u_c > 0$, we can divide by $u_c$ to get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu}{k} = \\rho \\beta u_c\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for a critical parameter. A convenient choice is the particle Reynolds number, defined as $Re_p \\equiv \\frac{\\rho u d_p}{\\mu}$. The critical particle Reynolds number, $Re_{p,c}$, is therefore:\n$$\nRe_{p,c} = \\frac{\\rho u_c d_p}{\\mu}\n$$\nFrom the equality of the drag terms, we can express $u_c$ as:\n$$\nu_c = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho k \\beta}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $u_c$ into the definition of $Re_{p,c}$:\n$$\nRe_{p,c} = \\frac{\\rho d_p}{\\mu} \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho k \\beta} \\right) = \\frac{d_p}{k \\beta}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given expressions for $k$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\phi^{3} d_p^{2}}{C_v (1-\\phi)^{2}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\beta = \\frac{C_i (1-\\phi)}{\\phi^{3} d_p}\n$$\nThe product $k \\beta$ is:\n$$\nk \\beta = \\left( \\frac{\\phi^{3} d_p^{2}}{C_v (1-\\phi)^{2}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{C_i (1-\\phi)}{\\phi^{3} d_p} \\right)\n$$\nCanceling common terms ($\\phi^3$, one $d_p$, one $(1-\\phi)$):\n$$\nk \\beta = \\frac{d_p C_i}{C_v (1-\\phi)}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the expression for $Re_{p,c}$:\n$$\nRe_{p,c} = \\frac{d_p}{k \\beta} = d_p \\left( \\frac{C_v (1-\\phi)}{d_p C_i} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the desired expression for the critical particle Reynolds number as a function of $\\phi$, $C_v$, and $C_i$:\n$$\nRe_{p,c} = \\frac{C_v(1-\\phi)}{C_i}\n$$\n\n(b) We now calibrate this expression using the representative Ergun-type coefficients $C_v = 150$ and $C_i = 1.75$. We evaluate $Re_{p,c}$ for a packed bed with porosity $\\phi = 0.37$.\n$$\nRe_{p,c} = \\frac{150 (1 - 0.37)}{1.75}\n$$\n$$\nRe_{p,c} = \\frac{150 (0.63)}{1.75}\n$$\n$$\nRe_{p,c} = \\frac{94.5}{1.75} = 54\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nRe_{p,c} = 54.00\n$$\n\n(c) We are asked to estimate the inertial coefficient $\\beta$ for a packed bed of spherical particles with diameter $d_p = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and porosity $\\phi = 0.37$, using the same calibration coefficients. First, we must convert the particle diameter to SI units: $d_p = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nUsing the expression for $\\beta$ with $C_i = 1.75$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{C_i (1-\\phi)}{\\phi^{3} d_p} = \\frac{1.75 (1 - 0.37)}{(0.37)^{3} (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1.75 (0.63)}{(0.050653) (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1.1025}{1.51959 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta \\approx 7255.234\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\beta = 7255\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$",
