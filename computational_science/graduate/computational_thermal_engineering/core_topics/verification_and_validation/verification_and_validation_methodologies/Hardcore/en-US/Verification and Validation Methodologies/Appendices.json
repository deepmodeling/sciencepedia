This involves replacing the finite difference approximation of the spatial derivative with its Taylor series expansion to reveal the higher-order derivative terms that are implicitly introduced by the discretization. We must consider two cases based on the sign of the velocity $u$.\n\n**Case 1: $u > 0$**\nFor $u > 0$, the upwind scheme uses a first-order backward difference for the spatial derivative.

By comparison, we identify the artificial diffusivity for $u0$ as:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{art}} = u \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}\n$$\n\n**Case 2: $u  0$**\nFor $u  0$, the upwind scheme uses a first-order forward difference. The semi-discrete equation at node $x_i$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d T_i}{d t} + u \\left( \\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\\Delta x} \\right) = 0\n$$\nWe expand $T_{i+1} = T(x_i + \\Delta x, t)$ in a Taylor series about $x_i$:\n$$\nT_{i+1} = T_i + \\Delta x \\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right|_i + \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\right|_i + \\frac{\\Delta x^3}{6} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^3 T}{\\partial x^3}\\right|_i + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^4)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the finite difference term:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\left( T_i + \\Delta x \\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right|_i + \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\right|_i + \\dots \\right) - T_i}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\\Delta x} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right|_i + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\\right|_i + \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{6} \\left.\\frac{\\partial^3 T}{\\partial x^3}\\right|_i + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^3)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression back into the semi-discrete equation to get the modified equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + u \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{6} \\frac{\\partial^3 T}{\\partial x^3} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^3) \\right) = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = -u \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} - u \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{6} \\frac{\\partial^3 T}{\\partial x^3} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^4)\n$$\nThis is the modified equation for $u0$. Comparing the leading-order error term to $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{art}} \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}$, we identify the artificial diffusivity for $u0$ as:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{art}} = -u \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}\n$$\n\n**General Expression for $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{art}}$**\nWe have derived the artificial diffusivity for both signs of $u$:\n-   If $u > 0$, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{art}} = u \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}$.\n-   If $u  0$, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{art}} = -u \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}$.\n\nWe can combine these two results into a single expression using the absolute value function. If $u > 0$, then $|u| = u$. If $u  0$, then $|u| = -u$. In both cases, the expression for the artificial diffusivity can be written as:\n$$\n\\kappa_{\\mathrm{art}} = |u| \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}\n$$\nThis single, closed-form expression is valid for any non-zero $u$. This term is always non-negative ($\\kappa_{\\mathrm{art}} \\ge 0$, since $\\Delta x  0$), which confirms its diffusive nature, as a negative diffusion coefficient would lead to an ill-posed, unstable problem.",

We can eliminate $c$ to solve for a more accurate estimate of $\\phi_{\\mathrm{exact}}$, known as the Richardson extrapolated solution, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{extrap}}^{21}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{extrap}}^{21} = \\frac{r_{21}^p \\phi_1 - \\phi_2}{r_{21}^p - 1} = \\phi_1 + \\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_2}{r_{21}^p - 1}\n$$\nThe estimated error in the fine-grid solution, $E_a^{21}$, is the difference between the fine-grid solution and this extrapolated value:\n$$\nE_a^{21} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{extrap}}^{21} - \\phi_1 = \\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_2}{r_{21}^p - 1}\n$$\nThe GCI is defined as a measure of the uncertainty in the fine-grid solution. It is based on the magnitude of the estimated error, scaled by a factor of safety $F_s$, and is typically expressed as a relative quantity with respect to the fine-grid solution itself.\n$$\n\\mathrm{GCI}_{21} = F_s \\frac{|E_a^{21}|}{|\\phi_1|} = F_s \\frac{1}{|\\phi_1|} \\left| \\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_2}{r_{21}^p - 1} \\right|\n$$\nSince $r_{21} = 2  1$ and $p_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 1.98  0$, the term $r_{21}^p - 1$ is positive. The formula can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GCI}_{21} = \\frac{F_s}{r_{21}^p - 1} \\left| \\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_2}{\\phi_1} \\right|\n$$\n\nThe factor of safety, $F_s$, serves to create a conservative error band. Its value reflects the confidence in the assumptions underlying the extrapolation. The Richardson extrapolation assumes the numerical solution is in the asymptotic range, which may not be perfectly true. $F_s  1$ (e.g., $F_s=1.25$ for three-grid studies with a well-behaved order of convergence) inflates the estimated error to create an uncertainty interval, $\\phi_1 \\pm (\\mathrm{GCI}_{21} \\cdot \\phi_1)$, that is likely (e.g., with $95\\%$ confidence) to contain the exact solution $\\phi_{\\mathrm{exact}}$.\n\n**Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given values into the derived formula for $\\mathrm{GCI}_{21}$.\nThe givens are:\n- Fine-grid solution: $\\phi_1 = 1.0010 \\times 10^4$\n- Coarse-grid solution: $\\phi_2 = 1.0040 \\times 10^4$\n- Refinement ratio: $r_{21} = 2$\n- Observed order of accuracy: $p = p_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 1.98$\n- Factor of safety: $F_s = 1.25$\n\nFirst, we compute the relative difference between the two solutions:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{\\phi_1 - \\phi_2}{\\phi_1} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{1.0010 \\times 10^4 - 1.0040 \\times 10^4}{1.0010 \\times 10^4} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{-0.0030 \\times 10^4}{1.0010 \\times 10^4} \\right| = \\frac{0.0030}{1.0010} = \\frac{3}{1001}\n$$\nNext, we compute the denominator term involving the order of accuracy:\n$$\nr_{21}^p - 1 = 2^{1.98} - 1\n$$\nNow, substitute these into the GCI formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{GCI}_{21} = \\frac{1.25}{2^{1.98} - 1} \\times \\frac{3}{1001}\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\n2^{1.98} \\approx 3.944835\n$$\n$$\nr_{21}^p - 1 \\approx 2.944835\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{3}{1001} \\approx 0.002997003\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{GCI}_{21} \\approx \\frac{1.25}{2.944835} \\times 0.002997003 \\approx (0.424469) \\times (0.002997003) \\approx 0.00127214\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $2$, $7$, and $2$. The fifth digit is $1$, so we round down.\n$$\n\\mathrm{GCI}_{21} \\approx 0.001272\n$$\nThis value represents an estimated uncertainty of approximately $0.1272\\%$ in the fine-grid solution $\\phi_1$.",
