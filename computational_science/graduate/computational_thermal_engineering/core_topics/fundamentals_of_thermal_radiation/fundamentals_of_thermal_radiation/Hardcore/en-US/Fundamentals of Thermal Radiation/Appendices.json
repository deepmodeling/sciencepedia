It is defined by integrating the directional radiance $L_b(\\theta, \\phi)$ over all solid angles of the hemisphere. For a diffuse surface, the radiance is isotropic, i.e., independent of direction $(\\theta, \\phi)$. Thus, $L_b$ can be taken out of the angular integral.\nThe spectral hemispherical emissive power, $E_{\\lambda,b}$, is related to the spectral radiance, $L_{\\lambda,b}$, by:\n$$E_{\\lambda,b} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} L_{\\lambda,b} \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\,d\\theta \\,d\\phi$$\nSince the surface is diffuse, $L_{\\lambda,b}$ is constant with respect to direction.
