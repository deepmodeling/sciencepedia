            "problem": "Consider two large, parallel, isothermal, opaque plates, labeled surface $1$ and surface $2$, facing each other across a vacuum gap. The medium between them is nonparticipating (no absorption, emission, or scattering), and the surfaces are gray and diffuse. Each plate fully sees only the other (i.e., the view factor $F_{12} = 1$ and no radiation escapes the two-surface enclosure). The plate areas are equal to $A$, the emissivities are $\\epsilon_{1}$ and $\\epsilon_{2}$, and the absolute temperatures are $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$. Let the Stefan–Boltzmann constant be denoted by $\\sigma$, and let the blackbody emissive power be $E_{b,i} = \\sigma T_{i}^{4}$ for surface $i$.\n\nStarting only from the conservation of energy at a surface, the definition of radiosity and irradiation for a gray, diffuse surface, and view-factor relations, do the following:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing a complete and consistent set of givens for a standard problem in radiative heat transfer. It is therefore deemed valid. The solution proceeds by systematically addressing the four required tasks.\n\nThe analysis begins from first principles for radiative exchange between two opaque, diffuse, gray surfaces forming an enclosure. The surfaces are labeled $1$ and $2$, with areas $A_1 = A_2 = A$, emissivities $\\epsilon_1$ and $\\epsilon_2$, and held at absolute temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively.\n\nThe radiosity, $J_i$, of a surface $i$ is defined as the total radiant energy flux leaving the surface. For an opaque, diffuse, gray surface, it is the sum of emitted and reflected radiation:\n$$ J_i = E_i + \\rho_i G_i $$\nwhere $E_i$ is the emissive power, $\\rho_i$ is the reflectivity, and $G_i$ is the irradiation (incident radiant energy flux). The emissive power is $E_i = \\epsilon_i E_{b,i}$, where $E_{b,i} = \\sigma T_i^4$ is the blackbody emissive power. For an opaque surface, conservation of energy for incident radiation requires that the sum of absorptivity $\\alpha_i$ and reflectivity $\\rho_i$ is unity, $\\alpha_i + \\rho_i = 1$. For a gray surface, emissivity equals absorptivity, $\\epsilon_i = \\alpha_i$. Therefore, the reflectivity is $\\rho_i = 1 - \\epsilon_i$. Substituting these relations into the radiosity definition gives:\n$$ J_i = \\epsilon_i E_{b,i} + (1 - \\epsilon_i) G_i $$\nThe irradiation $G_i$ on surface $i$ is the sum of radiosities from all surfaces in the enclosure, weighted by the respective view factors. For an $N$-surface enclosure:\n$$ G_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ji} J_j $$\nIn this two-surface enclosure, the plates are large and parallel, so each surface sees only the other. This implies view factors $F_{12}=1$ and $F_{21}=1$ (which is consistent with the reciprocity relation $A_1 F_{12} = A_2 F_{21}$ since $A_1=A_2$). Also, since the surfaces are flat, they cannot see themselves, so $F_{11}=0$ and $F_{22}=0$.\n\nThe irradiation on surface $1$ is due solely to surface $2$: $G_1 = F_{21} J_2 = (1)J_2 = J_2$.\nThe irradiation on surface $2$ is due solely to surface $1$: $G_2 = F_{12} J_1 = (1)J_1 = J_1$.\n\n1. Formulate the two coupled linear equations for $J_1$ and $J_2$.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for irradiation into the radiosity equations for each surface yields the following system.\n\nFor surface $1$:\n$$ J_1 = \\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1 - \\epsilon_1) G_1 = \\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1 - \\epsilon_1) J_2 $$\nRearranging into a standard linear form:\n$$ J_1 - (1 - \\epsilon_1) J_2 = \\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} $$\n\nFor surface $2$:\n$$ J_2 = \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\epsilon_2) G_2 = \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\epsilon_2) J_1 $$\nRearranging into a standard linear form:\n$$ -(1 - \\epsilon_2) J_1 + J_2 = \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} $$\nThese two equations form the coupled linear system for the unknown radiosities $J_1$ and $J_2$.\n\n2. Solve for $J_1$ and $J_2$.\n\nWe solve a system of two linear equations. From the second equation, we express $J_2$ in terms of $J_1$:\n$$ J_2 = \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\epsilon_2) J_1 $$\nSubstitute this expression for $J_2$ into the first equation:\n$$ J_1 - (1 - \\epsilon_1) [\\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\epsilon_2) J_1] = \\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} $$\n$$ J_1 - (1 - \\epsilon_1)\\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} - (1 - \\epsilon_1)(1 - \\epsilon_2) J_1 = \\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} $$\nGroup the terms involving $J_1$:\n$$ J_1 [1 - (1 - \\epsilon_1)(1 - \\epsilon_2)] = \\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1 - \\epsilon_1)\\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} $$\nThe coefficient of $J_1$ simplifies to:\n$$ 1 - (1 - \\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2) = \\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2 $$\nSolving for $J_1$:\n$$ J_1 = \\frac{\\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1 - \\epsilon_1)\\epsilon_2 E_{b,2}}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} $$\nBy symmetry of the problem geometry and the governing equations, the expression for $J_2$ can be obtained by interchanging all subscripts $1$ and $2$:\n$$ J_2 = \\frac{\\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\epsilon_2)\\epsilon_1 E_{b,1}}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} $$\n\n3. Derive the net radiative heat transfer rate $Q$ using the electrical-network analogy.\n\nThe radiative network analogy models heat transfer as a current flowing through a series of resistances. The potential at each node is a blackbody emissive power, $E_{b,i}$, or a radiosity, $J_i$.\n\nThe surface resistance, $R_{\\text{surf},i}$, for a gray, diffuse surface $i$ relates its blackbody potential to its radiosity potential. It is given by:\n$$ R_{\\text{surf},i} = \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_i}{\\epsilon_i A_i} $$\nThe space resistance, $R_{\\text{space},ij}$, between two surfaces $i$ and $j$ accounts for the geometric configuration (view factors) and is given by:\n$$ R_{\\text{space},ij} = \\frac{1}{A_i F_{ij}} $$\nFor the given two-surface enclosure, the network is a simple series circuit:\n$E_{b,1} \\rightarrow R_{\\text{surf},1} \\rightarrow J_1 \\rightarrow R_{\\text{space},12} \\rightarrow J_2 \\rightarrow R_{\\text{surf},2} \\rightarrow E_{b,2}$\n\nThe resistances are:\n$R_{\\text{surf},1} = \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_1}{\\epsilon_1 A}$\n$R_{\\text{space},12} = \\frac{1}{A_1 F_{12}} = \\frac{1}{A \\cdot 1} = \\frac{1}{A}$\n$R_{\\text{surf},2} = \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_2}{\\epsilon_2 A}$\n\nThe total resistance of the network, $R_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the series resistances:\n$$ R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{surf},1} + R_{\\text{space},12} + R_{\\text{surf},2} = \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_1}{\\epsilon_1 A} + \\frac{1}{A} + \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_2}{\\epsilon_2 A} $$\n$$ R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} - 1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1 \\right) $$\nThe net heat transfer rate, $Q$, from surface $1$ to surface $2$ is the total potential difference divided by the total resistance:\n$$ Q = \\frac{E_{b,1} - E_{b,2}}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{\\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{A} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1 \\right)} = \\frac{A \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1} $$\n\n4. Demonstrate consistency between the radiosity and network solutions.\n\nFirst, we show that the net heat rate calculated from the radiosity solution matches the network result. The net heat rate leaving surface $1$ is $Q_1 = A_1 (J_1 - G_1)$. Since $G_1 = J_2$ and $A_1=A$:\n$$ Q_1 = A (J_1 - J_2) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $J_1$ and $J_2$ from Part 2:\n$$ J_1 - J_2 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} \\left[ (\\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} + (1 - \\epsilon_1)\\epsilon_2 E_{b,2}) - (\\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} + (1 - \\epsilon_2)\\epsilon_1 E_{b,1}) \\right] $$\n$$ J_1 - J_2 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} [(\\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_1(1-\\epsilon_2)) E_{b,1} - (\\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_2(1-\\epsilon_1)) E_{b,2}] $$\n$$ J_1 - J_2 = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} [\\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2 E_{b,1} - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2}] = \\frac{\\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2 (E_{b,1} - E_{b,2})}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} $$\nSo, the heat rate is:\n$$ Q_1 = A (J_1 - J_2) = \\frac{A \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2 (E_{b,1} - E_{b,2})}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} $$\nThis expression can be rewritten by dividing the numerator and denominator by $\\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2$:\n$$ Q_1 = \\frac{A (E_{b,1} - E_{b,2})}{\\frac{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2}{\\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2}} = \\frac{A (E_{b,1} - E_{b,2})}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} - 1} $$\nThis is identical to the net heat rate $Q$ derived from the network analogy.\n\nSecond, we show that the expressions for $J_1$ and $J_2$ are consistent with the network result. From the network, the heat rate $Q$ must equal the potential drop across the first surface resistance:\n$$ Q = \\frac{E_{b,1} - J_1}{R_{\\text{surf},1}} = \\frac{E_{b,1} - J_1}{(1 - \\epsilon_1)/(\\epsilon_1 A)} $$\nSolving for $J_1$:\n$$ J_1 = E_{b,1} - Q \\cdot R_{\\text{surf},1} = E_{b,1} - \\frac{A (E_{b,1} - E_{b,2})}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\epsilon_1}{\\epsilon_1 A} $$\n$$ J_1 = E_{b,1} - \\frac{(E_{b,1} - E_{b,2})(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} - 1)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1} $$\nPutting this over a common denominator:\n$$ J_1 = \\frac{E_{b,1}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1) - (E_{b,1} - E_{b,2})(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} - 1)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1} $$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$ \\frac{E_{b,1}}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{E_{b,1}}{\\epsilon_2} - E_{b,1} - \\frac{E_{b,1}}{\\epsilon_1} + E_{b,1} + \\frac{E_{b,2}}{\\epsilon_1} - E_{b,2} = \\frac{E_{b,1}}{\\epsilon_2} + \\frac{E_{b,2}}{\\epsilon_1} - E_{b,2} = \\frac{\\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} + \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2} - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2}}{\\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} $$\nThe denominator is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1 = \\frac{\\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2}{\\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} $$\nDividing the numerator by the denominator yields:\n$$ J_1 = \\frac{\\epsilon_1 E_{b,1} + \\epsilon_2 E_{b,2}(1 - \\epsilon_1)}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2} $$\nThis expression is identical to the result for $J_1$ from Part 2. A similar derivation for $J_2 = E_{b,2} + Q \\cdot R_{\\text{surf},2}$ confirms the expression for $J_2$. The two methods are fully consistent.\n\nThe final expressions for $J_1$, $J_2$, and $Q$ are provided in terms of the given variables.\n$J_1 = \\frac{\\sigma(\\epsilon_1 T_1^4 + (1 - \\epsilon_1)\\epsilon_2 T_2^4)}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2}$\n$J_2 = \\frac{\\sigma(\\epsilon_2 T_2^4 + (1 - \\epsilon_2)\\epsilon_1 T_1^4)}{\\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 - \\epsilon_1 \\epsilon_2}$\n$Q = \\frac{A \\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_1} + \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_2} - 1}$",

            "problem": "Consider an opaque, isothermal, polished surface patch of area $A$ embedded in a vacuum enclosure.

The definitions of radiance, irradiance, and the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) are standard. The Phong-type BRDF is a common empirical model for specular reflection, and the Lambertian model is the definition of a perfectly diffuse surface. The energy conservation constraint is a fundamental physical law. All necessary variables and functional forms are provided to derive the requested ratio. The problem asks for justification of the BRDF normalization, which is a required check for physical consistency. This check is performed as part of the solution process below. The problem is free from ambiguity, contradiction, and factual error.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe analysis begins from the fundamental definitions of radiative quantities. Radiance, denoted $L$, is defined as the radiant power per unit projected area per unit solid angle, in units of $\\mathrm{W} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$. Irradiance, denoted $E$, is the radiant power incident upon a surface per unit area, in units of $\\mathrm{W} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n\nThe radiant power, $P$, received by a detector of small acceptance solid angle $\\Delta \\Omega$ viewing a surface patch of area $A$ is given by the product of the outgoing radiance from the surface in the detector's direction, $L_o(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o)$, the projected area of the surface normal to the viewing direction, $A \\cos\\theta_d$, and the solid angle subtended by the detector, $\\Delta \\Omega$.\n$$\nP = L_o(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o) (A \\cos\\theta_d) \\Delta\\Omega\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o$ is the direction towards the detector, and $\\theta_d$ is the polar angle of this direction with respect to the surface normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$.\n\nThe problem states that the outgoing radiance $L_o$ is related to the incident irradiance $E_i$ via the BRDF, $f_r(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_i, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o)$:\n$$\nL_o(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o) = f_r(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_i, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o) E_i(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_i)\n$$\nFor a collimated beam of irradiance $G_0$ incident normally on the surface, the incident irradiance $E_i$ is simply $G_0$. The incident direction $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_i$ is along $\\boldsymbol{n}$, so the polar angle of incidence is $\\theta_i=0$. Therefore, the outgoing radiance in the direction of the detector, $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o$, is:\n$$\nL_o(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o) = f_r(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_i, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o) G_0\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for detector power gives a general formula:\n$$\nP = G_0 A \\Delta\\Omega f_r(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_i, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o) \\cos\\theta_d\n$$\n\nFirst, we must justify the normalization of the specified specular BRDF, $f_r^{\\mathrm{spec}}$. The energy conservation principle requires that the directional-hemispherical reflectance $\\rho$ is equal to the integral of the BRDF multiplied by the cosine of the outgoing polar angle over the entire hemisphere of outgoing directions $\\Omega^{+}$.\n$$\n\\rho = \\int_{\\Omega^{+}} f_r(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_i,\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_o)\\,\\cos\\theta_o\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_o\n$$\nThe differential solid angle in spherical coordinates is $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega_o = \\sin\\theta_o\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta_o\\,\\mathrm{d}\\phi_o$, where $\\phi_o$ is the azimuthal angle.

The limits of integration change from $\\theta_o=0$ to $u=1$ and from $\\theta_o=\\pi/2$ to $u=0$.\n$$\n= \\rho(n+2) \\int_{1}^{0} u^{n+1} (-\\mathrm{d}u) = \\rho(n+2) \\int_{0}^{1} u^{n+1} \\mathrm{d}u = \\rho(n+2) \\left[ \\frac{u^{n+2}}{n+2} \\right]_{0}^{1} = \\rho(n+2) \\left( \\frac{1}{n+2} - 0 \\right) = \\rho\n$$\nThe specular BRDF is properly normalized to satisfy the energy conservation constraint.\n\nNow we can calculate the detector power for both the diffuse and specular cases.\n\n**Case 1: Diffuse Surface ($P_{\\mathrm{diff}}$)**\nThe diffuse (Lambertian) BRDF is constant for all outgoing directions: $f_r^{\\mathrm{diff}} = \\rho/\\pi$. The outgoing radiance is also independent of direction, $L_{o,\\mathrm{diff}} = (\\rho/\\pi)G_0$.

The summation rule for view factors is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy for a closed system. The use of a Monte Carlo method to compute these factors and the subsequent analysis of numerical error are standard practices in computational thermal engineering.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary data (the matrix $\\mathbf{F}$) and a clear, unambiguous calculational procedure. A unique, stable, and meaningful numerical solution exists. The fact that the row sums of the provided matrix are not exactly unity is expected for a numerical result and is the very basis for the problem, which asks to quantify this discrepancy.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, formal language, free of any subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the View Factor Summation Rule**\nThe view factor, $F_{ij}$, is defined as the fraction of the total radiant energy leaving surface $i$ that arrives directly at surface $j$. The surfaces are assumed to be diffuse emitters and reflectors, meaning that the intensity of radiation leaving a surface is uniform in all directions.\n\nFor a closed enclosure comprised of $N$ surfaces (in this case, $N=4$), any radiation emitted from a surface $i$ must ultimately be intercepted by one of the surfaces within the enclosure. This includes the possibility of surface $i$ intercepting its own radiation if it is concave (i.e., $F_{ii} > 0$). This statement is a direct expression of the conservation of energy for the radiation field.\n\nSince $F_{ij}$ represents the fraction of energy leaving surface $i$ that strikes surface $j$, the sum of these fractions over all possible receiving surfaces $j=1, 2, ..., N$ must account for all of the energy leaving surface $i$. Therefore, the sum of all view factors from a given surface $i$ to all other surfaces $j$ (including itself) in the enclosure must be exactly equal to unity. This is known as the summation rule or closure relation for view factors:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{N} F_{ij} = 1\n$$\nFor the specific case of the $4$-surface enclosure described, this condition must hold for each surface $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{4} F_{ij} = F_{i1} + F_{i2} + F_{i3} + F_{i4} = 1\n$$\nThis is the necessary condition that must be satisfied by the set of view factors leaving any surface in a closed enclosure.\n\n**Calculation of Residuals and the Consistency Metric**\nThe provided view factor matrix $\\mathbf{F}$ is the result of a numerical Monte Carlo simulation and is therefore subject to statistical error. The summation rule provides a benchmark against which the accuracy of the numerical result can be checked. The closure residual, $r_i$, is defined as the deviation from this rule for each surface $i$:\n$$\nr_i = 1 - \\sum_{j=1}^{4} F_{ij}\n$$\nWe now compute the sum for each row of the given matrix $\\mathbf{F}$ and the corresponding residual $r_i$.\n\nFor surface $i=1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{4} F_{1j} = 0.0002 + 0.515 + 0.245 + 0.237 = 0.9972\n$$\n$$\nr_1 = 1 - 0.9972 = 0.0028\n$$\n\nFor surface $i=2$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{4} F_{2j} = 0.514 + 0.0003 + 0.246 + 0.237 = 0.9973\n$$\n$$\nr_2 = 1 - 0.9973 = 0.0027\n$$\n\nFor surface $i=3$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{4} F_{3j} = 0.350 + 0.349 + 0.0001 + 0.290 = 0.9891\n$$\n$$\nr_3 = 1 - 0.9891 = 0.0109\n$$\n\nFor surface $i=4$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{4} F_{4j} = 0.351 + 0.349 + 0.290 + 0.0002 = 0.9902\n$$\n$$\nr_4 = 1 - 0.9902 = 0.0098\n$$\n\nThe Euclidean consistency metric, $\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|_{2}$, is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of these residuals:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{4} r_{i}^{2}} = \\sqrt{r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2 + r_4^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values of the residuals:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{(0.0028)^2 + (0.0027)^2 + (0.0109)^2 + (0.0098)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{0.00000784 + 0.00000729 + 0.00011881 + 0.00009604}\n$$\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|_{2} = \\sqrt{0.00022998}\n$$\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|_{2} \\approx 0.01516509...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
