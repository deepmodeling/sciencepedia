The process involves several steps, starting from the fundamental heat equation.\n\nFirst, we model the transient conduction in the liquid adjacent to the wall.

At time $t=0$, the wall at $y=0$ is suddenly raised to and maintained at a temperature $T_w = T_l + \\Delta T$. The one-dimensional heat conduction in the liquid is governed by the heat diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha_l \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial y^2}\n$$\nwhere $T(y,t)$ is the temperature in the liquid, $t$ is time, $y$ is the spatial coordinate normal to the wall, and $\\alpha_l$ is the thermal diffusivity of the liquid.\n\nThe initial and boundary conditions are:\n1. Initial condition: $T(y, 0) = T_l$ for $y  0$.\n2. Boundary condition at the wall: $T(0, t) = T_w$ for $t  0$.\n3. Boundary condition far from the wall: $T(y \\to \\infty, t) = T_l$ for $t  0$.\n\nThis is a classic problem in heat transfer, and its solution is found using a similarity transformation. Let's define a dimensionless temperature $\\theta$ and a similarity variable $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\theta(y,t) = \\frac{T(y,t) - T_l}{T_w - T_l} = \\frac{T(y,t) - T_l}{\\Delta T}\n$$\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{y}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha_l t}}\n$$\nThe solution for the dimensionless temperature profile is given in terms of the complementary error function, $\\text{erfc}(\\eta)$:\n$$\n\\theta(\\eta) = \\text{erfc}(\\eta)\n$$\nSubstituting back, the temperature profile in the liquid is:\n$$\n\\frac{T(y,t) - T_l}{\\Delta T} = \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{y}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha_l t}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT(y,t) = T_l + \\Delta T \\cdot \\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{y}{2\\sqrt{\\alpha_l t}}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we find the instantaneous heat flux into the liquid at the wall, $q''_q(t)$, using Fourier's law of conduction:\n$$\nq''_q(t) = -k_l \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right|_{y=0}\n$$\nwhere $k_l$ is the thermal conductivity of the liquid.
