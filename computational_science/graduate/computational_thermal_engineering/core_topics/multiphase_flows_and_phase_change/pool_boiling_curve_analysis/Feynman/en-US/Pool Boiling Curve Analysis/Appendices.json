This practice builds a foundational bridge between the bubble-scale events and the overall surface heat flux, $q''$. By quantifying the energy carried by a single bubble and scaling it up by the density of nucleation sites and their frequency, you will develop a bottom-up model for the energy transport in the nucleate boiling regime.

            "problem": "An electrically heated horizontal plate of area $A_h$ is immersed in saturated liquid water at atmospheric pressure. The macroscopic boiling heat flux, denoted $q''$, is the rate of heat transfer per unit heater area from the surface to the liquid-vapor mixture. To connect $q''$ to bubble-scale energetics, consider the following controlled scenario designed for computational thermal engineering analysis of the pool boiling curve.\n\nAssume nucleation sites are uniformly distributed over the heater with an areal density $n_a$ (sites per unit area), and each active site produces a single spherical vapor bubble that detaches at a departure diameter $D_d$ and repeats this cycle at a departure frequency $f_d$ (bubbles per site per second). Assume that during each cycle the bubble interior contains saturated vapor at the prevailing saturation state, and neglect sensible heating of the liquid, conduction through the liquid, radiation, and any heat carried by liquid microlayers or wake effects; treat latent heat associated with phase change as the only mechanism of energy removal.\n\nStarting from the definitions of mass, volume, and the specific enthalpy of vaporization (often denoted $h_{fg}$), and using basic geometry for a sphere, derive an expression for the latent heat consumed per bubble cycle $Q_b$. Then, by energy conservation at the surface, relate the aggregate latent heating rate from all sites to the macroscopic heat flux $q''$ measured over the heater area, expressing $q''$ in terms of $Q_b$, $f_d$, and $n_a$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the macroscopic boiling heat flux, $q''$, based on a microscopic model of bubble generation, and its subsequent numerical evaluation. The solution is developed in three stages as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the latent heat consumed per bubble cycle, $Q_b$. The problem states that each bubble is spherical and contains saturated vapor. The volume of a single spherical bubble, $V_b$, with a departure diameter $D_d$ is given by the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n$$V_b = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{D_d}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi D_d^3$$\nThe mass of the vapor, $m_b$, contained within this bubble volume is the product of the volume and the saturated vapor density, $\\rho_v$:\n$$m_b = \\rho_v V_b = \\rho_v \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi D_d^3\\right)$$\nThe latent heat of vaporization is the energy required to convert a unit mass of saturated liquid to saturated vapor. This is given as the specific enthalpy of vaporization, $h_{fg}$. Therefore, the total latent heat consumed to form one bubble, $Q_b$, is the product of the vapor mass and the specific enthalpy of vaporization:\n$$Q_b = m_b h_{fg} = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi D_d^3 \\rho_v\\right) h_{fg}$$\n\nSecond, we relate the aggregate latent heating rate to the macroscopic heat flux $q''$. The problem specifies an active nucleation site density of $n_a$ (sites per unit area). For a heater of total area $A_h$, the total number of active sites is $N = n_a A_h$. Each site produces bubbles at a frequency $f_d$ (bubbles per second per site). The rate of energy removal per site, $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{site}}$, is the energy per bubble, $Q_b$, multiplied by the bubble frequency, $f_d$:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{\\text{site}} = Q_b f_d$$\nThe total rate of heat transfer from the entire heater surface, $\\dot{Q}_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the rates from all active sites. Assuming uniform site distribution and behavior, this is the number of sites, $N$, multiplied by the rate per site:\n$$\\dot{Q}_{\\text{total}} = N \\dot{Q}_{\\text{site}} = (n_a A_h) (Q_b f_d)$$\nThe macroscopic heat flux, $q''$, is defined as the total heat transfer rate per unit heater area.

            "solution": "### Derivation\nWe begin by applying the principle of conservation of energy to a control volume that encloses the hemispherical vapor bubble. The first law of thermodynamics for this open system states that the rate of change of energy within the control volume is equal to the net rate of energy transfer into the system.\nThe energy increase within the bubble is primarily due to the generation of vapor mass. Let $\\dot{m}_{net}$ be the net rate of mass vaporized. The rate of energy storage is then $\\dot{m}_{net} h_{fg}$, where $h_{fg}$ is the latent heat of vaporization.\nEnergy enters the control volume via heat transfer from the heated surface through the evaporating microlayer, $\\dot{Q}_{evap}$. Energy leaves the control volume via heat transfer from the bubble cap to the subcooled bulk liquid, $\\dot{Q}_{cond}$. The energy balance is:\n$$ \\dot{m}_{net} h_{fg} = \\dot{Q}_{evap} - \\dot{Q}_{cond} $$\nThe heat input from the microlayer, $\\dot{Q}_{evap}$, is defined by the surface heat flux over the bubble footprint area, $q''_{\\mathrm{ml}}$. For a hemispherical bubble of radius $R$, the footprint is a circle of area $A_{footprint} = \\pi R^2$.\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{evap} = q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} A_{footprint} = q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} (\\pi R^2) $$\nThe heat output from the bubble cap, $\\dot{Q}_{cond}$, is due to condensation. The problem specifies this process is limited by steady-state conduction from the cap surface (at $T_{\\mathrm{sat}}$) into the semi-infinite subcooled liquid (at $T_{b}$). The rate of heat transfer for this configuration is given by Fourier's law, integrated over the geometry. This is a classic conduction shape factor problem. For a hemisphere of radius $R$ on an infinite adiabatic plane, the shape factor $S$ is $2\\pi R$.\nThe heat transfer rate is therefore:\n$$ \\dot{Q}_{cond} = S k_{l} (T_{\\mathrm{sat}} - T_{b}) = (2\\pi R) k_{l} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}} $$\nwhere $k_{l}$ is the thermal conductivity of the liquid and $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}} = T_{\\mathrm{sat}} - T_{b}$ is the degree of subcooling.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\dot{Q}_{evap}$ and $\\dot{Q}_{cond}$ into the energy balance equation:\n$$ \\dot{m}_{net} h_{fg} = q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} (\\pi R^2) - 2\\pi R k_{l} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}} $$\nTo understand how subcooling alters the microlayer heat flux $q''_{\\mathrm{ml}}$, we solve for this term:\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} (\\pi R^2) = \\dot{m}_{net} h_{fg} + 2\\pi R k_{l} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}} $$\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{net} h_{fg}}{\\pi R^2} + \\frac{2\\pi R k_{l} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{\\pi R^2} $$\n$$ q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} = \\frac{\\dot{m}_{net} h_{fg}}{A_{footprint}} + \\frac{2 k_{l} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{R} $$\nThis equation shows that the total microlayer heat flux, $q''_{\\mathrm{ml}}$, is composed of two parts. The first term, $\\frac{\\dot{m}_{net} h_{fg}}{A_{footprint}}$, represents the portion of the heat flux that contributes to the net growth of the bubble. The second term, $\\frac{2 k_{l} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{R}$, represents the additional heat flux required from the surface to offset the heat loss due to condensation at the bubble cap.\n\nUnder saturated conditions, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}} = 0$, and the condensation term vanishes. The entire microlayer heat flux contributes to bubble growth. The presence of subcooling introduces the condensation term, which alters the energy balance. This term, which we are asked to find and designate as $\\Delta q''_{\\mathrm{ml}}$, is the reduction in heat flux available for growth, or equivalently, the portion of $q''_{\\mathrm{ml}}$ that is channeled to balance condensation.\nThis term is expressed per unit bubble footprint area, as required. The derivation explicitly uses the hemispherical geometry to determine the total condensation rate $\\dot{Q}_{cond}$ and the footprint area $A_{footprint}$, relating them to find the flux contribution. The bubble cap area is $A_{cap} = 2\\pi R^2$, which is twice the footprint area $A_{footprint} = \\pi R^2$. The derived term correctly accounts for this geometric factor.\nThe alteration due to condensation is:\n$$ \\Delta q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} = \\frac{2 k_{l} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{R} $$\nThis expression rigorously shows the modification to the interfacial energy balance due to cap condensation, expressed as an equivalent flux over the bubble footprint.\n\n### Calculation\nWe now compute the numerical value for this reduction, $\\Delta q''_{\\mathrm{ml}}$, using the provided parameters:\n-   Liquid thermal conductivity, $k_{l} = 0.67\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n-   Bubble radius, $R = 1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   Subcooling, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}} = 10\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ \\Delta q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} = \\frac{2 \\times k_{l} \\times \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{sub}}}{R} $$\n$$ \\Delta q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} = \\frac{2 \\times (0.67\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (10\\ \\mathrm{K})}{1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} = \\frac{13.4\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}}}{1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ \\Delta q''_{\\mathrm{ml}} = 13400\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The fact that $q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}} \\propto g^{1/4}$ implies that as $g$ approaches zero, $q''_{\\mathrm{CHF}}$ also approaches zero. This signifies that in a zero-gravity environment, the mechanism for vapor removal (buoyancy) is absent, and the heater surface can become blanketed by vapor (film boiling) at extremely low heat fluxes, posing a significant challenge for thermal management systems in space.",
