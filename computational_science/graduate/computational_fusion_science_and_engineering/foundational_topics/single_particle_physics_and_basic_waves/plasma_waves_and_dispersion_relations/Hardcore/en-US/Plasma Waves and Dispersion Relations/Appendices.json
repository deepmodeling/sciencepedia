This first practice explores how to incorporate dissipative effects, such as collisions between electrons and ions, into the fluid picture.

Your final answer must be the expression for $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$ only, written in a dimensionless form with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the complex dielectric function $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$ for a cold, collisional, unmagnetized plasma. The derivation proceeds in two main steps: first, finding the complex conductivity $\\sigma(\\omega)$ from the electron fluid momentum balance, and second, relating this conductivity to the dielectric function using Maxwell's equations.\n\nThe starting point is the linearized momentum balance equation for the electron fluid. The problem specifies that we should consider the electric force, a linear collisional drag term, and neglect electron pressure, convective nonlinearities, and the magnetic component of the Lorentz force. The equation for a representative electron's velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is given by the balance of the rate of change of momentum, the electric force, and the collisional drag force:\n$$\nm_{e}\\frac{d\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -e\\mathbf{E} - m_{e}\\nu\\mathbf{v}\n$$\nHere, $m_{e}$ is the electron mass, $-e$ is the electron charge, $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, and $\\nu$ is the constant effective collision frequency.\n\nThe electric field is assumed to be time-harmonic with angular frequency $\\omega$, of the form $\\mathbf{E}(t) = \\Re\\{\\mathbf{E}_{0}\\exp(i\\omega t)\\}$. In a linear system, we can work with complex phasors for all time-varying quantities. We represent the electric field as $\\mathbf{E}(t) = \\mathbf{E}_{0}\\exp(i\\omega t)$ and the resulting electron fluid velocity as $\\mathbf{v}(t) = \\mathbf{v}_{0}\\exp(i\\omega t)$. With this representation, the time derivative operator becomes a multiplication by $i\\omega$: $\\frac{d}{dt} \\rightarrow i\\omega$.\n\nSubstituting these complex forms into the momentum equation yields:\n$$\nm_{e}(i\\omega \\mathbf{v}) = -e\\mathbf{E} - m_{e}\\nu\\mathbf{v}\n$$\nWe can now algebraically solve for the complex velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ in terms of the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n(i\\omega m_{e} + m_{e}\\nu)\\mathbf{v} = -e\\mathbf{E}\n$$\n$$\nm_{e}(i\\omega + \\nu)\\mathbf{v} = -e\\mathbf{E}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} = -\\frac{e}{m_{e}(\\nu + i\\omega)}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThis expression gives the velocity response of the electron fluid to the harmonic electric field.\n\nNext, we relate this velocity to the current density $\\mathbf{J}$. Since the ions are assumed to be immobile, the current is due solely to the motion of the electrons. For an electron density of $n_{0}$, the current density is defined as $\\mathbf{J} = -n_{0}e\\mathbf{v}$. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbf{v}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = -n_{0}e \\left( -\\frac{e}{m_{e}(\\nu + i\\omega)}\\mathbf{E} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{n_{0}e^{2}}{m_{e}(\\nu + i\\omega)}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of Ohm's law in the frequency domain, $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma(\\omega)\\mathbf{E}$, where $\\sigma(\\omega)$ is the complex conductivity. By comparison, we identify the expression for $\\sigma(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\omega) = \\frac{n_{0}e^{2}}{m_{e}(\\nu + i\\omega)}\n$$\nThis is the first part of the derivation. Now, we must relate $\\sigma(\\omega)$ to the dielectric function $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$.\n\nWe start from Ampere's law, one of Maxwell's equations. In a medium with free currents $\\mathbf{J}$ and for time-harmonic fields, it is written as:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0}(\\mathbf{J} + \\varepsilon_{0}\\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t})\n$$\nIn the frequency domain ($ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow i\\omega $), and using $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{H}$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J} + i\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe total current on the right-hand side, consisting of the conduction current $\\mathbf{J}$ and the displacement current $i\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{E}$, can be represented by a single effective displacement current using the complex dielectric function $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = i\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon(\\omega)\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the right-hand side gives:\n$$\ni\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon(\\omega)\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{J} + i\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma(\\omega)\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\ni\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon(\\omega)\\mathbf{E} = \\sigma(\\omega)\\mathbf{E} + i\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nDividing by $\\mathbf{E}$ (which is non-zero) and $i\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\omega) = \\frac{\\sigma(\\omega)}{i\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}} + 1\n$$\nThis is the general relationship between the dielectric function and conductivity for a linear, isotropic medium.\n\nNow, we substitute our derived expression for $\\sigma(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\omega) = 1 + \\frac{1}{i\\omega\\varepsilon_{0}} \\left( \\frac{n_{0}e^{2}}{m_{e}(\\nu + i\\omega)} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\omega) = 1 + \\frac{n_{0}e^{2}}{\\varepsilon_{0}m_{e}} \\frac{1}{i\\omega(\\nu + i\\omega)}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of the electron plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$, defined by $\\omega_{pe}^{2} = n_{0}e^{2}/(\\varepsilon_{0}m_{e})$. Substituting this into our expression for $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\omega) = 1 + \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^{2}}{i\\omega(\\nu + i\\omega)}\n$$\nTo obtain a more standard form, we can simplify the denominator:\n$$\ni\\omega(\\nu + i\\omega) = i\\omega\\nu + (i\\omega)^{2} = i\\omega\\nu - \\omega^{2} = -(\\omega^{2} - i\\omega\\nu)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\omega) = 1 + \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^{2}}{-(\\omega^{2} - i\\omega\\nu)}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon(\\omega) = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^{2}}{\\omega^{2} - i\\omega\\nu}\n$$\nThis final expression gives the complex dielectric function $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$ in terms of the wave frequency $\\omega$, the collision frequency $\\nu$, and the electron plasma frequency $\\omega_{pe}$, as required. All quantities in the final fraction are frequencies squared, making the fraction dimensionless, and thus $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$ is dimensionless, as expected.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the dispersion relation for one-dimensional electrostatic electron plasma waves (Langmuir waves) and its application to calculate a specific frequency correction. The derivation begins with the linearized Vlasov-Poisson system for electrons, assuming immobile ions.\n\nThe linearized Vlasov equation for the perturbed electron distribution function, $f_1(x, v, t)$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial x} - \\frac{e E_1}{m_e} \\frac{\\partial f_{0e}}{\\partial v} = 0\n$$\nwhere $f_{0e}(v)$ is the unperturbed Maxwellian distribution, $e$ is the elementary charge, $m_e$ is the electron mass, and $E_1(x,t)$ is the perturbed electric field, related to the potential $\\phi_1$ by $E_1 = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial x}$.
