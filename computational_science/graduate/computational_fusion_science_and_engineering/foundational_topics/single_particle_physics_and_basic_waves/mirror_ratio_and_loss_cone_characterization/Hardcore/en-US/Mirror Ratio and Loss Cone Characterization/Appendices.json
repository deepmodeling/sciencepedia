The confinement region is symmetric about $z = 0$. Using first principles, determine the extrema of the magnetic field along the axis and identify the locations where they occur. Then, using the core definition of the mirror ratio in a magnetic mirror, form the dimensionless mirror ratio in terms of only $a$ and $L$. Your reasoning should proceed from basic calculus for extremum identification and physically justified properties of this field profile, and any symmetry arguments must be explicitly justified.\n\nAs context, recall that magnetic mirroring and the associated loss-cone physics in magnetically confined plasmas arise from adiabatic invariance of the first invariant of motion, but do not use any pre-supplied shortcut formulas; build all necessary steps from foundational definitions and invariance principles. You must first determine $B_{\\min}$ and $B_{\\max}$ along $z \\in [-L, L]$, and only then form the mirror ratio.\n\nExpress the final mirror ratio as a dimensionless analytic expression. Provide only the mirror ratio in your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the mirror ratio for a linear magnetic mirror device. The axial magnetic field strength, $B(z)$, is given by the function:\n$$\nB(z) = B_{0}\\left(1 + a z^{2}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $B_{0}  0$, $a  0$, and the confinement region is defined by the interval $z \\in [-L, L]$ with $L  0$.\n\nThe mirror ratio, $R_m$, is fundamentally defined as the ratio of the maximum magnetic field strength, $B_{\\max}$, to the minimum magnetic field strength, $B_{\\min}$, within the confinement region.\n$$\nR_m = \\frac{B_{\\max}}{B_{\\min}}\n$$\nTo find the mirror ratio, we must first find the extrema of the function $B(z)$ on the closed interval $[-L, L]$. According to the extreme value theorem, a continuous function on a closed interval must attain its absolute maximum and minimum values on that interval. These extrema occur either at the critical points of the function within the interval or at the endpoints of theinterval.\n\nFirst, we identify the critical points of $B(z)$ by finding where its first derivative with respect to $z$ is zero or undefined. The function $B(z)$ is a polynomial in $z$, so it is differentiable everywhere. We compute the derivative $\\frac{dB}{dz}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left[ B_{0}\\left(1 + a z^{2}\\right) \\right] = B_{0} \\frac{d}{dz} \\left(1 + a z^{2}\\right) = B_{0}(2az) = 2aB_{0}z\n$$\nTo find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero:\n$$\n2aB_{0}z = 0\n$$\nGiven that $a  0$ and $B_{0}  0$, the product $2aB_{0}$ is non-zero. Therefore, the only solution to this equation is:\n$$\nz = 0\n$$\nThis critical point $z=0$ lies within the interior of the interval $[-L, L]$ since $L0$. To determine if this point corresponds to a local minimum or maximum, we can use the second derivative test. The second derivative of $B(z)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2B}{dz^2} = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left( 2aB_{0}z \\right) = 2aB_{0}\n$$\nSince $a  0$ and $B_{0}  0$, the second derivative $\\frac{d^2B}{dz^2} = 2aB_{0}$ is strictly positive for all $z$. This indicates that the function $B(z)$ is concave up everywhere, and thus the critical point at $z=0$ corresponds to a local and absolute minimum.\n\nThe value of the magnetic field at this minimum is:\n$$\nB(0) = B_{0}\\left(1 + a(0)^{2}\\right) = B_{0}\n$$\nSo, the minimum magnetic field strength is $B_{\\min} = B_{0}$, and it occurs at the center of the device, $z=0$.\n\nNext, we must evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval, $z = -L$ and $z = L$.\nAt $z=L$:\n$$\nB(L) = B_{0}\\left(1 + a(L)^{2}\\right) = B_{0}\\left(1 + aL^{2}\\right)\n$$\nAt $z=-L$:\n$$\nB(-L) = B_{0}\\left(1 + a(-L)^{2}\\right) = B_{0}\\left(1 + aL^{2}\\right)\n$$\nAs an explicit justification of the symmetry, the function $B(z)$ is an even function of $z$ because it depends only on $z^2$. This means $B(z) = B(-z)$, so the magnetic field strength is symmetric about the plane $z=0$. Consequently, the values at the endpoints $z=L$ and $z=-L$ are identical.\n\nTo find the maximum magnetic field, $B_{\\max}$, we compare the value at the minimum, $B(0)$, with the values at the endpoints, $B(\\pm L)$.\nWe have $B(0) = B_0$ and $B(\\pm L) = B_0(1 + aL^2)$. Since the problem states that $a  0$ and $L  0$, the term $aL^2$ is strictly positive. Therefore:\n$$\n1 + aL^2  1\n$$\nMultiplying by the positive constant $B_0$ preserves the inequality:\n$$\nB_0(1 + aL^2)  B_0\n$$\nThis confirms that the maximum value of the magnetic field occurs at the endpoints $z = \\pm L$.\n$$\nB_{\\max} = B(\\pm L) = B_{0}\\left(1 + aL^{2}\\right)\n$$\nWe have now identified the extrema:\n- Minimum field: $B_{\\min} = B_{0}$ at $z=0$.\n- Maximum field: $B_{\\max} = B_{0}(1 + aL^{2})$ at $z=\\pm L$.\n\nFinally, we can form the dimensionless mirror ratio, $R_m$, by substituting these values into its definition:\n$$\nR_m = \\frac{B_{\\max}}{B_{\\min}} = \\frac{B_{0}\\left(1 + aL^{2}\\right)}{B_{0}}\n$$\nThe term $B_{0}$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the expression for the mirror ratio in terms of only $a$ and $L$:\n$$\nR_m = 1 + aL^{2}\n$$\nThis result is dimensionless as required, as the product $aL^2$ must be dimensionless for the expression $1 + a z^2$ to be consistent (meaning $a$ must have units of inverse length squared).",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in plasma physics concerning the motion of charged particles in a magnetic mirror configuration. We can therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe fundamental principles governing the particle's motion are the conservation of its total kinetic energy, $E$, and its magnetic moment, $\\mu$. We are given that there are no electric fields, so the potential energy is zero.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is:\n$$ E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_{\\parallel}^{2} + v_{\\perp}^{2}) $$\nHere, $m$ is the particle mass, $v$ is its total speed, and $v_{\\parallel}$ and $v_{\\perp}$ are the velocity components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field vector $\\vec{B}$, respectively. Since $E$ and $m$ are constant, the total speed $v$ is also constant along the particle's trajectory.\n\nThe magnetic moment, or first adiabatic invariant, is:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2B} $$\nwhere $B = |\\vec{B}|$ is the magnitude of the magnetic field. The conservation of $\\mu$ is a cornerstone of this problem.\n\nLet us denote conditions at the midplane of the mirror device, where the magnetic field is at its minimum value $B_{\\min}$, with a subscript '$0$'. Any quantity without a subscript refers to its value at an arbitrary point along the particle's path where the field strength is $B$.\n\nFrom the conservation of $\\mu$, we can write:\n$$ \\frac{m v_{\\perp,0}^{2}}{2 B_{\\min}} = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^{2}}{2 B} $$\nThis allows us to relate the perpendicular speed at any point to its initial value at the midplane:\n$$ v_{\\perp}^{2} = v_{\\perp,0}^{2} \\left( \\frac{B}{B_{\\min}} \\right) $$\n\nFrom the conservation of energy, we have:\n$$ v^{2} = v_{\\parallel}^{2} + v_{\\perp}^{2} = v_{\\parallel,0}^{2} + v_{\\perp,0}^{2} $$\nWe can find an expression for the parallel velocity component $v_{\\parallel}$ at any point $B$:\n$$ v_{\\parallel}^{2} = v^{2} - v_{\\perp}^{2} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_{\\perp}^{2}$ from $\\mu$ conservation:\n$$ v_{\\parallel}^{2} = v^{2} - v_{\\perp,0}^{2} \\left( \\frac{B}{B_{\\min}} \\right) $$\n\nThe problem specifies the initial pitch angle $\\alpha$ at the midplane. The velocity components at the midplane can be expressed in terms of the total speed $v$ and this pitch angle $\\alpha$ as:\n$$ v_{\\perp,0} = v \\sin\\alpha $$\n$$ v_{\\parallel,0} = v \\cos\\alpha $$\nThese definitions are consistent with the problem's statement that $\\tan\\alpha = v_{\\perp,0}/v_{\\parallel,0}$. Substituting $v_{\\perp,0}^{2} = v^{2} \\sin^{2}\\alpha$ into the equation for $v_{\\parallel}^{2}$:\n$$ v_{\\parallel}^{2} = v^{2} - (v^{2} \\sin^{2}\\alpha) \\left( \\frac{B}{B_{\\min}} \\right) $$\nFactoring out $v^{2}$:\n$$ v_{\\parallel}^{2} = v^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{B}{B_{\\min}} \\sin^{2}\\alpha \\right) $$\nThis equation describes how the particle's parallel kinetic energy changes as it moves along the magnetic field line.\n\nA particle is reflected, or \"mirrored\", at the point where its parallel velocity becomes zero, $v_{\\parallel} = 0$. At this turning point, all of its kinetic energy is in the perpendicular motion. Let the magnetic field at the reflection point be $B_{\\text{refl}}$. Setting $v_{\\parallel} = 0$ provides the condition for reflection:\n$$ 0 = v^{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{B_{\\text{refl}}}{B_{\\min}} \\sin^{2}\\alpha \\right) $$\nFor a particle with non-zero speed ($v \\neq 0$), this simplifies to:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{B_{\\text{refl}}}{B_{\\min}} \\sin^{2}\\alpha \\quad \\implies \\quad \\sin^{2}\\alpha = \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\text{refl}}} $$\n\nA particle is considered trapped or confined if it reflects before reaching the ends of the mirror, where the field is at its maximum, $B_{\\max}$. This means the reflection must occur at a field strength $B_{\\text{refl}} \\le B_{\\max}$. Applying this to our reflection condition:\n$$ \\frac{B_{\\min}}{\\sin^{2}\\alpha} \\le B_{\\max} $$\nRearranging this inequality gives the condition for particle confinement in terms of its initial pitch angle $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\sin^{2}\\alpha \\ge \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}} $$\nUsing the definition of the mirror ratio, $R \\equiv B_{\\max}/B_{\\min}$, the confinement condition becomes:\n$$ \\sin^{2}\\alpha \\ge \\frac{1}{R} $$\n\nParticles that do not satisfy this condition will pass through the mirror and be lost. These particles are said to be in the \"loss cone\". The critical pitch angle, $\\alpha_c$, defines the boundary of this loss cone. It corresponds to a particle that just barely reflects at the maximum magnetic field, i.e., where $B_{\\text{refl}} = B_{\\max}$. At this critical angle, the confinement condition is an equality:\n$$ \\sin^{2}\\alpha_{c} = \\frac{1}{R} $$\nSince the pitch angle is in the range $[0, \\pi/2]$, we can take the positive square root:\n$$ \\sin\\alpha_{c} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R}} $$\nThus, the critical pitch angle is given by:\n$$ \\alpha_{c} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R}}\\right) $$\nAny particle launched at the midplane with an initial pitch angle $\\alpha  \\alpha_c$ is within the loss cone and will escape.\n\nNow we apply the given numerical values. We have a mirror ratio $R=16$. The values for particle speed $v=3 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{m/s}$ and minimum field $B_{\\min}=0.2\\,\\text{T}$ are not required for calculating $\\alpha_c$, as it depends only on the geometry of the magnetic field expressed via $R$.\n$$ \\alpha_{c} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{16}}\\right) = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\arcsin(0.25) $$\nTo express this in degrees, we perform the numerical calculation:\n$$ \\alpha_{c} \\approx 14.477512...^{\\circ} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\alpha_{c} \\approx 14.48^{\\circ} $$\n\nNext, we evaluate the trajectory of a particle launched with an initial pitch angle of $\\alpha_{\\text{initial}} = 10^{\\circ}$. We compare this angle with the critical angle $\\alpha_c$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{initial}} = 10^{\\circ}  14.48^{\\circ} \\approx \\alpha_{c} $$\nSince the initial pitch angle is smaller than the critical angle, the particle's velocity vector lies inside the loss cone. Therefore, the particle is not confined and will be lost.\n\nFinally, we determine the indicator variable $L$, which is defined as $L=1$ for a lost particle and $L=0$ for a confined particle. Since the particle is lost, we have $L=1$.\n\nThe required answer is the row matrix $(\\alpha_c, L)$.",

Trapping and Passing Criterion**\n\nA particle is \"trapped\" if it is reflected by the magnetic mirror before it can escape the device. This physical reflection point, or \"turning point,\" is where the parallel velocity $v_\\parallel$ becomes zero. If a particle's parallel velocity becomes zero at a position $|s|  L$, it is trapped. If the particle reaches the end of the mirror, $|s| = L$, with a non-zero parallel velocity, it escapes and is classified as \"passing.\" A particle that reaches $|s|=L$ with exactly $v_\\parallel=0$ is, by the problem's definition, considered trapped.\n\nThe numerical simulation will directly test for this condition. We will integrate the equations of motion for $s(t)$ and $v_\\parallel(t)$ and monitor the state of the particle. The simulation terminates and reports a classification based on two conditions:\n1.  **Trapped:** The particle's parallel velocity $v_\\parallel(t)$ reverses sign at a position $|s(t)| \\le L$. This indicates a turning point has been reached inside the mirror.\n2.  **Passing:** The particle's position $s(t)$ satisfies $|s(t)|  L$. This indicates the particle has exited the mirror from one end.\n\n**3. Numerical Integration Scheme**\n\nTo solve the system of ODEs for $s(t)$ and $v_\\parallel(t)$, we employ the Velocity Verlet (or leapfrog) algorithm. This is a symplectic integrator, well-suited for Hamiltonian systems like this one, as it exhibits good long-term energy conservation properties. Given the state $(s_i, v_{\\parallel,i})$ at time $t_i$, the state at time $t_{i+1} = t_i + \\Delta t$ is computed as follows:\n\nFirst, we define the parallel acceleration $a_\\parallel(s) = -\\frac{\\mu}{m}\\frac{dB}{ds}$.\n\n1.  Calculate the half-step velocity (this step is implicit in the standard form): $v_{\\parallel, i+1/2} = v_{\\parallel, i} + \\frac{1}{2} a_\\parallel(s_i) \\Delta t$.\n2.  Update the position to the full step: $s_{i+1} = s_i + v_{\\parallel, i} \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2} a_\\parallel(s_i) (\\Delta t)^2$. This is mathematically equivalent to $s_{i+1} = s_i + v_{\\parallel,i+1/2} \\Delta t$.\n3.  Calculate the new acceleration $a_\\parallel(s_{i+1})$ at the new position.\n4.  Update the velocity to the full step: $v_{\\parallel, i+1} = v_{\\parallel, i} + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_\\parallel(s_i) + a_\\parallel(s_{i+1})\\right)\\Delta t$. This is equivalent to $v_{\\parallel, i+1} = v_{\\parallel, i+1/2} + \\frac{1}{2}a_\\parallel(s_{i+1}) \\Delta t$.\n\nThis scheme is applied iteratively, starting from the initial conditions $(s_0, v_{\\parallel,0})$, until a trapping or passing condition is met. A sufficiently small time step $\\Delta t$ is chosen to ensure the dynamics are well-resolved. Given particle speeds of $\\sim 10^6 \\, \\text{m/s}$ and a device length of $\\sim 1 \\, \\text{m}$, the characteristic bounce time is on the order of microseconds ($10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}$). A time step of $\\Delta t = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{s}$ provides ample resolution.\n\n**4. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nFor each test case specified by $(m, v, B_{\\min}, R_m, L, s_0, \\alpha_0)$:\n\n1.  **Initialize**:\n    -   Calculate initial parallel and perpendicular velocities: $v_{\\parallel,0} = v\\cos(\\alpha_0)$, $v_{\\perp,0} = v\\sin(\\alpha_0)$.\n    -   Store the initial direction of motion via $\\text{sign}(v_{\\parallel,0})$. If $v_{\\parallel,0} = 0$, the particle is immediately classified as trapped.\n    -   Compute the magnetic field at the start position, $B(s_0)$.\n    -   Compute the conserved magnetic moment, $\\mu = m v_{\\perp,0}^2 / (2 B(s_0))$.\n    -   Initialize current state: $s \\leftarrow s_0$, $v_\\parallel \\leftarrow v_{\\parallel,0}$.\n\n2.  **Iterate**:\n    -   Start a time-stepping loop up to a maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite execution.\n    -   Inside the loop, apply one step of the Velocity Verlet algorithm to update $s$ and $v_\\parallel$.\n    -   After each step, check termination conditions:\n        -   If $|s|  L$, the particle has escaped. The trajectory is `passing`. Return `False`.\n        -   If the sign of the current $v_\\parallel$ is opposite to or zero compared to the initial $v_\\parallel$, a reflection has occurred. The trajectory is `trapped`. Return `True`.\n\n3.  **Output**: Collect the boolean results for all test cases and format them as required.",
