            "introduction": "The performance of a magnetic confinement device is fundamentally limited by how well it prevents particles and heat from escaping the plasma core. A key mechanism for this transport is governed by particles \"trapped\" in regions of weak magnetic field. This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to connect the geometric structure of the magnetic field to the fraction of trapped particles, $f_t$. By deriving the expression for $f_t$ from first principles and applying it to simplified models of tokamak and stellarator fields, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how differing magnetic geometries directly influence neoclassical transport, a critical factor in comparing configuration performance .",

            "problem": "You are tasked with deriving and computing the trapped-particle fraction $f_t$ in magnetically confined plasmas from first principles, using the ratio of the maximum and minimum magnetic field strengths $B_{\\max}$ and $B_{\\min}$ along a single closed field line on a flux surface. You will compare two magnetic confinement configuration families: a circular, axisymmetric tokamak and a helical-rippled stellarator. The derivation and computation must be based on fundamental principles and plausible, self-consistent geometry models of $B(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the poloidal angle parameterizing position along the field line.\n\nFundamental base to be used:\n- Conservation of magnetic moment $\\mu = m v_\\perp^2/(2 B)$ for sufficiently magnetized particles in slowly varying fields, and conservation of total kinetic energy $E = m(v_\\perp^2 + v_\\parallel^2)/2$ in the absence of collisions.\n- Isotropic velocity-space distribution, meaning particle directions are uniformly distributed over the unit sphere.\n- The magnetic mirror condition relating pitch-angle at $B_{\\min}$ to reflection at $B_{\\max}$.\n\nGeometry models for the magnetic field magnitude along a field line on a circular concentric flux surface:\n- Tokamak-like variation due to toroidal curvature:\n  $$B_{\\mathrm{tok}}(\\theta) = B_0 \\, \\frac{R_0}{R_0 + r \\cos\\theta},$$\n  where $B_0$ is the on-axis magnetic field in $\\mathrm{T}$, $R_0$ is the major radius in $\\mathrm{m}$, $r$ is the minor radius in $\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ is the poloidal angle in radians.\n- Stellarator-like variation with additional helical ripple superimposed on the tokamak-like variation:\n  $$B_{\\mathrm{stel}}(\\theta) = B_0 \\, \\frac{R_0}{R_0 + r \\cos\\theta} \\, \\left(1 + \\delta \\cos(N \\theta)\\right),$$\n  where $\\delta$ is the dimensionless ripple amplitude and $N$ is the integer field-period number.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of plasma physics and provides a complete and consistent set of parameters for a solvable computational task. The derivation and subsequent calculation are standard procedures in the study of magnetic confinement fusion. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the trapped-particle fraction, $f_t$, and then compute it for several magnetic field configurations. The derivation will be based on the first principles provided: the conservation of a particle's magnetic moment, $\\mu$, and its total kinetic energy, $E$.\n\nLet us begin with the definitions of the conserved quantities for a single particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ moving in a magnetic field $B$:\nThe magnetic moment is given by $\\mu = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2 B}$, where $v_{\\perp}$ is the component of the particle's velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field vector.\nThe kinetic energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m (v_{\\perp}^2 + v_{\\parallel}^2)$, where $v_{\\parallel}$ is the velocity component parallel to the field and $v$ is the total speed.\n\nIn a static magnetic field, $E$ is conserved, which implies the particle's total speed $v$ is constant. The magnetic moment $\\mu$ is an adiabatic invariant, conserved so long as the magnetic field varies slowly in space and time relative to the particle's gyromotion. We assume these conditions hold.\n\nFrom the conservation of $\\mu$ and $E$, we can establish the condition for particle trapping. The constancy of $\\mu$ implies that $\\frac{v_{\\perp}^2}{B}$ is a constant along the particle's trajectory. Let us express this in terms of the pitch angle, $\\alpha$, defined by $v_{\\perp} = v \\sin \\alpha$ and $v_{\\parallel} = v \\cos \\alpha$. Substituting this into the invariant gives:\n$$ \\frac{v^2 \\sin^2 \\alpha}{B} = \\text{constant} $$\nSince $v$ is also constant, we have the relation:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2 \\alpha}{B} = \\text{constant} $$\n\nA particle is considered \"trapped\" if its motion along a field line is reversed by the magnetic mirror effect. This occurs at a \"turning point\" where the parallel velocity $v_{\\parallel}$ becomes zero. At such a point, the total kinetic energy is purely perpendicular, so $v_{\\perp} = v$, which implies that the pitch angle $\\alpha = \\pi/2$, and thus $\\sin^2 \\alpha = 1$. Let $B_{\\text{turn}}$ be the magnetic field strength at this turning point.\n\nLet us evaluate the invariant $\\frac{\\sin^2 \\alpha}{B}$ at two locations along the field line: the turning point and the point where the magnetic field is at its minimum, $B_{\\min}$. At the location of $B_{\\min}$, let the pitch angle be $\\alpha_{\\min}$. Equating the invariant at these two points gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\sin^2 \\alpha_{\\min}}{B_{\\min}} = \\frac{1}{B_{\\text{turn}}} $$\nThis allows us to determine the magnetic field strength at which a particle with pitch angle $\\alpha_{\\min}$ at the low-field point will be reflected:\n$$ B_{\\text{turn}} = \\frac{B_{\\min}}{\\sin^2 \\alpha_{\\min}} $$\n\nA particle is trapped in the magnetic well between $B_{\\min}$ and $B_{\\max}$ if its turning point occurs at a field strength $B_{\\text{turn}} \\le B_{\\max}$. This leads to the trapping condition on the initial pitch angle $\\alpha_{\\min}$:\n$$ \\frac{B_{\\min}}{\\sin^2 \\alpha_{\\min}} \\le B_{\\max} $$\nRearranging this inequality yields the fundamental condition for trapping:\n$$ \\sin^2 \\alpha_{\\min} \\ge \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the fraction of particles that satisfy this condition. The problem states that the velocity-space distribution is isotropic, meaning the particle velocity vectors are uniformly distributed over all solid angles. The fraction of trapped particles, $f_t$, is therefore the ratio of the solid angle corresponding to the trapped region of velocity space to the total solid angle of a sphere, which is $4\\pi$.\n\nThe element of solid angle in spherical velocity coordinates is $d\\Omega = \\sin\\alpha \\, d\\alpha \\, d\\phi$. We integrate this over the region of pitch angles that satisfy the trapping condition. Let the mirror ratio be $R = B_{\\max}/B_{\\min}$. The condition is $\\sin^2 \\alpha_{\\min} \\ge 1/R$. Let us define a critical angle $\\alpha_c \\in [0, \\pi/2]$ such that $\\sin \\alpha_c = 1/\\sqrt{R}$. The trapping condition becomes $|\\sin \\alpha_{\\min}| \\ge \\sin \\alpha_c$. Since $\\alpha_{\\min}$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, this corresponds to the interval $\\alpha_{\\min} \\in [\\alpha_c, \\pi - \\alpha_c]$. This region in velocity space is a \"belt\" around the equator, while the \"passing\" particles occupy cones at the poles (the loss cones).\n\nThe solid angle for the trapped particles is:\n$$ \\Omega_{\\text{trapped}} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi-\\alpha_c} \\sin \\alpha_{\\min} \\, d\\alpha_{\\min} $$\n$$ \\Omega_{\\text{trapped}} = 2\\pi \\left[ -\\cos \\alpha_{\\min} \\right]_{\\alpha_c}^{\\pi-\\alpha_c} = 2\\pi (-\\cos(\\pi - \\alpha_c) - (-\\cos \\alpha_c)) $$\n$$ \\Omega_{\\text{trapped}} = 2\\pi (\\cos \\alpha_c + \\cos \\alpha_c) = 4\\pi \\cos \\alpha_c $$\n\nThe trapped particle fraction is the ratio of this solid angle to the total solid angle $4\\pi$:\n$$ f_t = \\frac{\\Omega_{\\text{trapped}}}{\\Omega_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{4\\pi \\cos \\alpha_c}{4\\pi} = \\cos \\alpha_c $$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2 \\alpha_c + \\sin^2 \\alpha_c = 1$, and knowing $\\alpha_c$ is in the first quadrant, we have $\\cos \\alpha_c = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2 \\alpha_c}$. Substituting $\\sin \\alpha_c = 1/\\sqrt{R}$:\n$$ f_t = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{R}} $$\nFinally, substituting $R = B_{\\max}/B_{\\min}$, we arrive at the desired closed-form expression:\n$$ f_t = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{B_{\\min}}{B_{\\max}}} $$\n\nFor the computational part of the task, we will implement this result. The magnetic field strength along a field line, $B(\\theta)$, is given for two configurations. For the tokamak:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{tok}}(\\theta) = B_0 \\, \\frac{R_0}{R_0 + r \\cos\\theta} $$\nFor the stellarator, a helical ripple is added:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{stel}}(\\theta) = B_0 \\, \\frac{R_0}{R_0 + r \\cos\\theta} \\, \\left(1 + \\delta \\cos(N \\theta)\\right) $$\nwhere the parameters are the on-axis field $B_0$, major radius $R_0$, minor radius $r$, ripple amplitude $\\delta$, and field-period number $N$.\n\nFor each test case, the procedure is as follows:\n1.  Sample the poloidal angle $\\theta$ with $N_\\theta = 2000$ points uniformly distributed in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$.\n2.  Evaluate $B(\\theta)$ at each sample point using the appropriate formula and parameters.\n3.  Numerically determine $B_{\\max}$ and $B_{\\min}$ by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array of $B(\\theta)$ values.\n4.  Calculate the mirror ratio $R = B_{\\max} / B_{\\min}$.\n5.  Compute the trapped fraction $f_t = \\sqrt{1 - 1/R}$.\n\nThis method will be applied to the four specified test cases to evaluate the impact of geometry (aspect ratio $r/R_0$) and helical ripples on particle confinement.",

This practice explores how to analyze the stability properties of a configuration directly from its $q$-profile.

            "solution": "The user has provided a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in the domain of computational fusion science, and a rigorous, step-by-step solution is warranted. The problem will be solved by analyzing each magnetic configuration separately to determine the locations of specified rational surfaces and the magnetic shear at those locations. These values will then be used to compute a proxy for tearing mode susceptibility for each case, and finally, their ratio. All calculations will be performed with the given parameters and definitions. The minor radius is given as $a=1$, which simplifies the expressions by normalizing all radial coordinates.\n\nFirst, we analyze Configuration $\\mathrm{T}$ (conventional tokamak). The safety factor profile is given by:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r) = q_{0,\\mathrm{T}} + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{T}} \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2}$$\nWith $q_{0,\\mathrm{T}} = 0.9$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{T}} = 2.5$, and $a=1$, the profile is:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r) = 0.9 + 2.5 r^{2}$$\nThe range of $q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r)$ for $r \\in [0, 1]$ is from $q_{\\mathrm{T}}(0) = 0.9$ to $q_{\\mathrm{T}}(1) = 0.9 + 2.5 = 3.4$. All rational values in the designated set $\\{2/1, 3/2, 4/3, 5/3, 7/3\\}$ lie within this range, so a corresponding resonant surface exists for each. The values are $2$, $1.5$, approximately $1.333$, approximately $1.667$, and approximately $2.333$.\n\nThe magnetic shear $s(r)$ is defined as $s(r) = \\frac{r}{q(r)} \\frac{dq}{dr}$. For Configuration $\\mathrm{T}$, the derivative of the q-profile is:\n$$\\frac{dq_{\\mathrm{T}}}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}(0.9 + 2.5 r^{2}) = 5r$$\nThe shear is then:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{T}}(r) = \\frac{r}{q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r)} (5r) = \\frac{5r^{2}}{q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r)}$$\nAt a resonant surface $r_{m/n}$, we have $q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r_{m/n}) = m/n$. We can express $r^2$ from the q-profile: $2.5r^2 = q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r) - 0.9$, so $5r^2 = 2(q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r) - 0.9)$. Substituting this into the shear expression yields a simplified form that depends only on the value of $q$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{T}}(r_{m/n}) = \\frac{2(q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r_{m/n}) - 0.9)}{q_{\\mathrm{T}}(r_{m/n})} = 2\\left(1 - \\frac{0.9}{m/n}\\right)$$\nWe now evaluate the shear $s_{\\mathrm{T}}$ for each rational surface:\n- For $q = 2/1 = 2$: $s_{\\mathrm{T}} = 2(1 - \\frac{0.9}{2}) = 2(0.55) = 1.1$.\n- For $q = 3/2 = 1.5$: $s_{\\mathrm{T}} = 2(1 - \\frac{0.9}{1.5}) = 2(1 - 0.6) = 0.8$.\n- For $q = 4/3$: $s_{\\mathrm{T}} = 2(1 - \\frac{0.9}{4/3}) = 2(1 - \\frac{2.7}{4}) = 2(1 - 0.675) = 0.65$.\n- For $q = 5/3$: $s_{\\mathrm{T}} = 2(1 - \\frac{0.9}{5/3}) = 2(1 - \\frac{2.7}{5}) = 2(1 - 0.54) = 0.92$.\n- For $q = 7/3$: $s_{\\mathrm{T}} = 2(1 - \\frac{0.9}{7/3}) = 2(1 - \\frac{2.7}{7}) = 2(\\frac{4.3}{7}) = \\frac{8.6}{7}$.\nAll shear values are positive, so $|s_{\\mathrm{T}}| = s_{\\mathrm{T}}$. The susceptibility proxy $S_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is the sum of the inverse shear values:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{T}} = \\sum_{m/n} \\frac{1}{|s_{\\mathrm{T}}(r_{m/n})|} = \\frac{1}{1.1} + \\frac{1}{0.8} + \\frac{1}{0.65} + \\frac{1}{0.92} + \\frac{7}{8.6}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{T}} \\approx 0.909091 + 1.25 + 1.538462 + 1.086957 + 0.813953 \\approx 5.598463$$\n\nNext, we analyze Configuration $\\mathrm{R}$ (reversed-shear tokamak). The safety factor profile is:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{R}}(r) = 1.8 + 1.6 \\left[\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^{2} - 0.4\\right]^{2} = 1.8 + 1.6(r^2 - 0.4)^2$$\nThis profile is non-monotonic.

The value at the magnetic axis is $q_{\\mathrm{R}}(0) = 1.8 + 1.6(-0.4)^2 = 1.8 + 0.256 = 2.056$. The value at the edge is $q_{\\mathrm{R}}(1) = 1.8 + 1.6(1-0.4)^2 = 1.8 + 0.576 = 2.376$. The range of $q_{\\mathrm{R}}$ for $r \\in [0,1]$ is $[1.8, 2.376]$.\nWe check which of the given rationals fall in this range:\n- $q = 2$: Yes, $1.8 \\le 2 \\le 2.376$.\n- $q = 1.5$: No.\n- $q = 4/3 \\approx 1.333$: No.\n- $q = 5/3 \\approx 1.667$: No.\n- $q = 7/3 \\approx 2.333$: Yes, $1.8 \\le 7/3 \\le 2.376$.\nThus, only the $q=2$ and $q=7/3$ surfaces exist in this configuration.\n\nWe find the radial locations $r_{m/n}$ by solving $q_{\\mathrm{R}}(r) = m/n$:\n$$(r^2 - 0.4)^2 = \\frac{(m/n) - 1.8}{1.6} \\implies r^2 = 0.4 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{(m/n) - 1.8}{1.6}}$$\nFor $q = 2$:\n$$r^2 = 0.4 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2 - 1.8}{1.6}} = 0.4 \\pm \\sqrt{0.125} = 0.4 \\pm \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = 0.4 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}$$\nThis gives two solutions for $r^2$ which are both positive and less than $1$, so two surfaces exist: $r^2_{2/1,1} \\approx 0.04645$ and $r^2_{2/1,2} \\approx 0.75355$.\nFor $q = 7/3$:\n$$r^2 = 0.4 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{7/3 - 1.8}{1.6}} = 0.4 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{8/15}{8/5}} = 0.4 \\pm \\sqrt{1/3}$$\nThe solution $r^2 = 0.4 - 1/\\sqrt{3}$ is negative, so it is unphysical.

This practice moves from core plasma physics to the critical engineering trade-offs involved in reactor design. You will analyze how the neutron power from a fusion plasma impacts the first wall and blanket components, which must simultaneously withstand high heat loads and breed sufficient tritium. By modeling these constraints for a tokamak and a stellarator, you will confront a central design challenge: balancing power handling against tritium self-sufficiency, and see how this balance differs based on the fundamental geometry of the confinement concept .",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of fusion energy, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of parameters, and objective in its formulation. It requests a derivation and series of calculations that are standard in conceptual fusion reactor analysis.\n\n**1. Derivation of Neutron Wall Loading Scaling**\n\nThe total fusion power, $P_{\\text{fus}}$, represents the total energy released from all fusion reactions per unit time. For a deuterium-tritium (D-T) reaction, a specific amount of energy, $E_{\\text{fus,reaction}}$, is released. Thus, the total rate of fusion reactions, $R_{\\text{fus}}$, is given by:\n$$R_{\\text{fus}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{fus}}}{E_{\\text{fus,reaction}}}$$\nIn a D-T reaction, the total energy is split between an alpha particle and a neutron. The problem states that the neutron carries a fixed fraction, $f_{n}$, of the total energy. The energy carried by a single neutron is $E_{n} = f_{n} E_{\\text{fus,reaction}}$. The total power carried by all neutrons produced in the plasma, $P_{n}$, is the reaction rate multiplied by the energy per neutron:\n$$P_{n} = R_{\\text{fus}} \\times E_{n} = \\left(\\frac{P_{\\text{fus}}}{E_{\\text{fus,reaction}}}\\right) \\times (f_{n} E_{\\text{fus,reaction}}) = f_{n} P_{\\text{fus}}$$\nThe neutron wall loading, $W_{n}$, is defined as the neutron power incident upon the first wall per unit area of that wall, $A_{\\text{wall}}$. To relate $P_{n}$ to $W_{n}$, we make the following assumptions about neutron transport:\n1.  Neutrons are emitted isotropically from the plasma volume.\n2.  Neutrons travel in straight lines from their point of creation to the first wall, with negligible attenuation or interaction within the plasma volume or the vacuum gap between the plasma and the wall.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the total neutron power generated within the plasma, $P_{n}$, is equal to the total neutron power incident upon the entire surface of the first wall. Therefore, we can write the wall loading as:\n$$W_{n} = \\frac{P_{n}}{A_{\\text{wall}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{n}$, we arrive at the explicit relationship:\n$$W_{n} = \\frac{f_{n} P_{\\text{fus}}}{A_{\\text{wall}}}$$\nSince $f_{n}$ is a constant for D-T fusion, and $P_{\\text{fus}}$ is a specified operating parameter, this derivation shows the scaling $W_{n} \\propto P_{\\text{fus}}/A_{\\text{wall}}$, as requested.\n\n**2. Computation of Neutron Wall Loading ($W_{n}$) for Each Configuration**\n\nWe are given the following parameters: $P_{\\text{fus}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{W}$ and $f_{n} = 14.1/17.6$.\nThe total neutron power is $P_{n} = f_{n} P_{\\text{fus}} = (14.1/17.6) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{W}) \\approx 1.6023 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{W}$.\n\nFor the tokamak:\nThe first-wall area, $A_{\\text{T}}$, is approximated by the surface area of a circular torus with major radius $R = 7.0\\ \\text{m}$ and minor radius $a = 2.0\\ \\text{m}$.\n$$A_{\\text{T}} = 4\\pi^{2} R a = 4\\pi^{2} (7.0\\ \\text{m})(2.0\\ \\text{m}) = 56\\pi^{2}\\ \\text{m}^{2}$$\nThe neutron wall loading for the tokamak, $W_{n, \\text{T}}$, is:\n$$W_{n, \\text{T}} = \\frac{f_{n} P_{\\text{fus}}}{A_{\\text{T}}} = \\frac{(14.1/17.6) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{W})}{56\\pi^{2}\\ \\text{m}^{2}} \\approx 2.900 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$$\n\nFor the stellarator:\nThe first-wall area, $A_{\\text{S}}$, is given by $A_{\\text{S}} = \\kappa A_{\\text{T}}$, with $\\kappa = 1.5$.\n$$A_{\\text{S}} = 1.5 \\times (56\\pi^{2}\\ \\text{m}^{2}) = 84\\pi^{2}\\ \\text{m}^{2}$$\nThe neutron wall loading for the stellarator, $W_{n, \\text{S}}$, is:\n$$W_{n, \\text{S}} = \\frac{f_{n} P_{\\text{fus}}}{A_{\\text{S}}} = \\frac{f_{n} P_{\\text{fus}}}{\\kappa A_{\\text{T}}} = \\frac{W_{n, \\text{T}}}{\\kappa} = \\frac{2.900 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}}{1.5} \\approx 1.933 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$$\n\n**3. Determination of Minimum Blanket Thickness ($t$)**\n\nFor each configuration, we must find the minimum thickness $t$ that satisfies two constraints: a heat flux limit and a tritium breeding ratio (TBR) requirement. The controlling thickness is the maximum of the two individual minimum thicknesses.\n\n**Constraint 1: Heat Flux Limit**\nThe heat flux at the back of the blanket, $q_{\\text{back}}(t)$, must not exceed $q_{\\max} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$.\nThe model is $q_{\\text{back}}(t) = W_{n}\\exp(-t/\\lambda)$. The constraint is $W_{n}\\exp(-t/\\lambda) \\le q_{\\max}$.\nTo find the minimum thickness, $t_{q}$, we solve the equality:\n$$W_{n}\\exp(-t_{q}/\\lambda) = q_{\\max} \\implies \\exp(-t_{q}/\\lambda) = \\frac{q_{\\max}}{W_{n}}$$\n$$-t_{q}/\\lambda = \\ln\\left(\\frac{q_{\\max}}{W_{n}}\\right) \\implies t_{q} = -\\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{q_{\\max}}{W_{n}}\\right) = \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{W_{n}}{q_{\\max}}\\right)$$\nGiven $\\lambda = 0.12\\ \\text{m}$.\n\n**Constraint 2: Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) Limit**\nThe TBR must be at least $\\text{TBR}_{\\min} = 1.10$.\nThe model is $\\text{TBR}(t) = c\\,\\beta\\left(1-\\exp(-t/\\delta)\\right)$. The constraint is $c\\,\\beta\\left(1-\\exp(-t/\\delta)\\right) \\ge \\text{TBR}_{\\min}$.\nTo find the minimum thickness, $t_{\\text{TBR}}$, we solve the equality:\n$$c\\,\\beta\\left(1-\\exp(-t_{\\text{TBR}}/\\delta)\\right) = \\text{TBR}_{\\min} \\implies 1-\\exp(-t_{\\text{TBR}}/\\delta) = \\frac{\\text{TBR}_{\\min}}{c\\beta}$$\n$$\\exp(-t_{\\text{TBR}}/\\delta) = 1 - \\frac{\\text{TBR}_{\\min}}{c\\beta} \\implies t_{\\text{TBR}} = -\\delta \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\text{TBR}_{\\min}}{c\\beta}\\right)$$\nGiven $\\delta = 0.10\\ \\text{m}$ and $\\beta = 1.40$.\n\n**Calculations for the Tokamak:**\nUsing $W_{n, \\text{T}} \\approx 2.900 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$ and $c_{\\text{T}} = 0.90$.\n-   Heat flux constraint thickness, $t_{q, \\text{T}}$:\n    $$t_{q, \\text{T}} = (0.12\\ \\text{m}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.900 \\times 10^{6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{6}}\\right) = (0.12\\ \\text{m}) \\ln(2.900) \\approx 0.1278\\ \\text{m}$$\n-   TBR constraint thickness, $t_{\\text{TBR, T}}$:\n    $$c_{\\text{T}}\\beta = 0.90 \\times 1.40 = 1.26$$\n    $$t_{\\text{TBR, T}} = -(0.10\\ \\text{m}) \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{1.10}{1.26}\\right) \\approx -(0.10\\ \\text{m}) \\ln(1 - 0.8730) = -(0.10\\ \\text{m}) \\ln(0.1270) \\approx 0.2064\\ \\text{m}$$\nThe required minimum blanket thickness for the tokamak, $t_{\\text{T}}$, is the maximum of these two values:\n$$t_{\\text{T}} = \\max(t_{q, \\text{T}}, t_{\\text{TBR, T}}) = \\max(0.1278\\ \\text{m}, 0.2064\\ \\text{m}) = 0.2064\\ \\text{m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $t_{\\text{T}} = 0.206\\ \\text{m}$.\n\n**Calculations for the Stellarator:**\nUsing $W_{n, \\text{S}} \\approx 1.933 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$ and $c_{\\text{S}} = 0.80$.\n-   Heat flux constraint thickness, $t_{q, \\text{S}}$:\n    $$t_{q, \\text{S}} = (0.12\\ \\text{m}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.933 \\times 10^{6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{6}}\\right) = (0.12\\ \\text{m}) \\ln(1.933) \\approx 0.0791\\ \\text{m}$$\n-   TBR constraint thickness, $t_{\\text{TBR, S}}$:\n    $$c_{\\text{S}}\\beta = 0.80 \\times 1.40 = 1.12$$\n    $$t_{\\text{TBR, S}} = -(0.10\\ \\text{m}) \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{1.10}{1.12}\\right) \\approx -(0.10\\ \\text{m}) \\ln(1 - 0.9821) = -(0.10\\ \\text{m}) \\ln(0.0179) \\approx 0.4025\\ \\text{m}$$\nThe required minimum blanket thickness for the stellarator, $t_{\\text{S}}$, is the maximum of these two values:\n$$t_{\\text{S}} = \\max(t_{q, \\text{S}}, t_{\\text{TBR, S}}) = \\max(0.0791\\ \\text{m}, 0.4025\\ \\text{m}) = 0.4025\\ \\text{m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, $t_{\\text{S}} = 0.403\\ \\text{m}$.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe pair of minimum blanket thicknesses, $(t_{\\text{T}}, t_{\\text{S}})$, rounded to three significant figures, is $(0.206\\ \\text{m}, 0.403\\ \\text{m})$.\n\nFor the tokamak, the TBR requirement ($t=0.206\\ \\text{m}$) is the controlling constraint, being more demanding than the heat flux limit ($t=0.128\\ \\text{m}$). For the stellarator, the lower wall loading relaxes the heat flux constraint significantly ($t=0.079\\ \\text{m}$), but the lower blanket coverage fraction ($c_S = 0.80$ vs $c_T = 0.90$) makes the TBR requirement much more difficult to meet, demanding a substantially thicker blanket ($t=0.403\\ \\text{m}$). This illustrates a key engineering trade-off between managing surface heat loads and achieving tritium self-sufficiency in different magnetic confinement geometries.",
