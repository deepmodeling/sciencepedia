These properties govern how magnetic field lines twist and change their pitch, which is essential for suppressing large-scale instabilities. This first exercise  provides a direct link between a fundamental engineering parameter—the multipolarity $l$ of the helical windings—and the resulting magnetic shear, illustrating how core stability characteristics are 'built-in' to the stellarator's design from the ground up.",

            "problem": "In the study of magnetically confined plasmas, such as in a stellarator or tokamak, the topology of magnetic field lines is crucial for confinement. The field lines lie on nested magnetic flux surfaces. The winding of a field line on a flux surface is characterized by the rotational transform, $\\iota$, which is the average poloidal angle a field line advances per toroidal transit. In general, $\\iota$ is a function of the flux surface label, which can be taken as the minor radius $r$.\n\nA magnetic island can form at a rational flux surface, $r_s$, where the rotational transform is a rational number, i.e., $\\iota(r_s) = n/m$ for integers $n$ and $m$. This is caused by a resonant magnetic field perturbation.\n\nConsider a simplified model of a toroidal plasma in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, \\zeta)$, where $r$ is the minor radius, $\\theta$ is the poloidal angle, and $\\zeta$ is the toroidal angle (related to the major radius $R_0$ by $z = R_0 \\zeta$). The unperturbed magnetic field is given by $\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_\\theta(r)\\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}} + B_\\phi \\hat{\\mathbf{\\phi}}$, where $B_\\phi$ is the large, approximately constant toroidal field.

In this case, the center of the magnetic island (the O-point) lies exactly on the resonant surface, $r=r_s$.\n\nHowever, if the curvature of the rotational transform profile is significant, the situation changes.

Starting from magnetostatic principles and the field-line Hamiltonian picture for magnetic islands, derive a model that expresses the resonant component $b_{mn}$ as a linear combination of coil currents and evaluate the associated island width. Then, compute the coil currents that minimize $|b_{mn}|$ under bound constraints and report the achieved island width. The physical unit for the coil currents must be Amperes ($\\mathrm{A}$) and the physical unit for the island width must be meters ($\\mathrm{m}$).

            "solution": "We begin from magnetostatics in the low-frequency limit where the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is generated by steady currents $\\mathbf{J}$. The governing equations are $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. Under these conditions, the principle of linear superposition applies: the total magnetic field is the sum of fields produced by individual coils, each proportional to the corresponding current, assuming the materials are linear and the magnetic response is sufficiently small to neglect saturation and non-linearities. In a stellarator, coil-generated fields can be characterized by their Fourier components in angle coordinates adapted to the magnetic geometry, such as Boozer coordinates $(\\theta,\\zeta)$ on a given flux surface.\n\nFor a given rational surface with rotational transform near $m/n$, the resonant perturbation couples strongly to the field-line dynamics. In the field-line Hamiltonian description, one uses canonical variables $(\\psi,\\theta)$ with the toroidal angle $\\zeta$ as the independent variable. The unperturbed Hamiltonian has the form $\\mathcal{H}_0(\\psi)$ that generates the field-line trajectory, and a small helical perturbation adds a term of the form $\\epsilon \\cos(m \\theta - n \\zeta)$ at the resonance characterized by integers $(m,n)$. Near resonance, expanding $\\mathcal{H}_0$ to second order around the resonant action $\\psi_r$ and retaining the perturbation yields a Hamiltonian equivalent to a pendulum. The canonical island half-width in action space scales as the square root of the perturbation strength,\n$$\n\\Delta \\psi \\propto \\sqrt{\\epsilon},\n$$\nwhere the proportionality involves the second derivative $\\mathcal{H}_0''(\\psi_r)$ and geometric factors. To relate this to a physical island width in meters, one uses a metric factor that maps action variation to radial or poloidal arc-length variation. Consequently, the physical island width $w$ obeys a square-root scaling with the perturbation amplitude,\n$$\nw = \\mathcal{K}_{mn} \\sqrt{|b_{mn}|},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{K}_{mn}$ is a case-dependent metric coefficient with units $\\mathrm{m}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Tesla}}$, and $|b_{mn}|$ is the magnitude of the resonant Fourier component of the radial magnetic field. The identification of the perturbation strength $\\epsilon$ with $|b_{mn}|$ is justified by the fact that, to leading order, the Hamiltonian perturbation enters through the resonant magnetic field component that couples to the field-line dynamics; the proportionality constant is absorbed into $\\mathcal{K}_{mn}$.\n\nBy linear superposition, the resonant component $b_{mn}$ can be modeled as a linear combination of the currents $I_j$ in $J$ trim coils via a transfer vector $\\mathbf{T} = [T_1,\\dots,T_J]$,\n$$\nb_{mn}^{\\mathrm{tot}} = b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{vac}} + \\sum_{j=1}^{J} T_j I_j,\n$$\nwhere $b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{vac}}$ is the static vacuum error field amplitude at the mode $(m,n)$. The trim-coil optimization aims to choose $I_j$ to minimize the absolute value of $b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$. A natural formulation is a bounded least-squares problem minimizing the squared residual:\n$$\n\\min_{\\mathbf{I}} \\; \\left| b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{vac}} + \\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\mathbf{I} \\right|^2 \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad l_j \\le I_j \\le u_j,\n$$\nwhere $l_j$ and $u_j$ are lower and upper bounds for each coil current reflecting engineering limits. This is a convex optimization problem; with the absolute value squared as objective, it reduces to a standard linear least-squares form with bound constraints. One can rewrite the residual as $A \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{b}$ with $A = \\mathbf{T}$ (a row vector) and $\\mathbf{b} = - b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{vac}}$, and solve using a bounded least-squares solver that enforces the box constraints. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for this problem coincide with the trust-region reflective algorithm used by well-established numerical solvers, ensuring convergence to the unique minimizer (or a minimum-norm solution if the problem is underdetermined).\n\nAfter obtaining the optimal currents $\\mathbf{I}^\\star$, we compute the residual resonant field\n$$\nb_{mn}^{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\mathbf{I}^\\star) = b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{vac}} + \\mathbf{T} \\cdot \\mathbf{I}^\\star,\n$$\nand then evaluate the achieved island width\n$$\nw = \\mathcal{K}_{mn} \\sqrt{ \\left| b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\mathbf{I}^\\star) \\right| }.\n$$\nComparing $w$ to the target width $w_\\star$ indicates whether the reduction meets the target; however, the output required is the actual achieved width and the coil currents.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- For each test case, form $A = \\mathbf{T}$ as a $1 \\times J$ matrix and $\\mathbf{b} = - b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{vac}}$ as a $1$-vector.\n- Solve the bounded least-squares problem $\\min_{\\mathbf{I}} \\|A \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{b}\\|_2$ with bounds $(\\mathbf{l}, \\mathbf{u})$ using a trust-region reflective method.\n- Compute the achieved resonant field $b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and the island width $w$ using the square-root scaling with the given $\\mathcal{K}_{mn}$.\n- Return, for each test case, the list $[I_1,\\dots,I_J,w]$ where $I_j$ are in $\\mathrm{A}$ and $w$ is in $\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nApplying to the test suite:\n- Test case $1$: With wide bounds, the solver can set $\\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\mathbf{I}$ nearly equal to $-b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{vac}}$, making $b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{tot}}$ close to zero and $w$ close to zero, hence below $w_\\star$.\n- Test case $2$: Tight bounds limit the compensating field to less than the vacuum error, leaving a nonzero residual and a width $w$ likely above $w_\\star$.\n- Test case $3$: Multiple coils with moderate bounds collectively cancel most of $b_{mn}^{\\mathrm{vac}}$, leaving a small residual; with the given $\\mathcal{K}_{mn}$ this produces a width $w$ below $w_\\star$.\n\nThe final program implements this logic, uses bound-constrained least squares, and prints the results in the specified single-line format with no spaces.",
