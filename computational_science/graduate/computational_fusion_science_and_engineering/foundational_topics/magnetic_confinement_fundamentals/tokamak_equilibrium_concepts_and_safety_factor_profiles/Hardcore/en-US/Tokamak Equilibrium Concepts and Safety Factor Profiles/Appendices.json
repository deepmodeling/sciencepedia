A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Magnetic Shear $s(r)$**\n\nThe problem defines the local magnetic shear, $s(r)$, as \"the dimensionless measure of the fractional radial variation of $q$ scaled by the minor radius\". This descriptive definition is formalized mathematically as follows:\n-   The \"radial variation of $q$\" corresponds to the derivative, $\\frac{dq}{dr}$.\n-   The \"fractional radial variation of $q$\" normalizes this derivative by $q$ itself, yielding $\\frac{1}{q} \\frac{dq}{dr}$. This is equivalent to the derivative of the natural logarithm of $q$, $\\frac{d(\\ln q)}{dr}$.\n-   \"Scaled by the minor radius\" implies multiplication by the radial coordinate, $r$.\n\nCombining these elements gives the standard definition for magnetic shear in a large-aspect-ratio, circular tokamak:\n$$\ns(r) = \\frac{r}{q(r)} \\frac{dq(r)}{dr}\n$$\n\nThe provided safety factor profile is:\n$$\nq(r) = q_0 + \\alpha r^2\n$$\nwhere $q_0 > 0$ is the safety factor on the magnetic axis ($r=0$) and $\\alpha$ is a constant parameter.\n\nFirst, we compute the radial derivative of $q(r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} (q_0 + \\alpha r^2) = 2 \\alpha r\n$$\nNext, we substitute the expressions for $q(r)$ and $\\frac{dq}{dr}$ into the formula for $s(r)$:\n$$\ns(r) = \\frac{r}{q_0 + \\alpha r^2} (2 \\alpha r)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final analytic form for the local magnetic shear:\n$$\ns(r) = \\frac{2 \\alpha r^2}{q_0 + \\alpha r^2}\n$$\n\n**Analysis of Parameter $\\alpha$ and Shear Profile**\n\nThe derived expression for $s(r)$ allows for a complete characterization of the shear profile based on the parameter $\\alpha$.\n\n1.  **Control of Shear Sign and Magnitude:**\n    The denominator, $q(r) = q_0 + \\alpha r^2$, is required by the problem to be positive for all $r \\in [0, a]$. The numerator contains the term $r^2$, which is always non-negative. Therefore, for any $r>0$, the sign of the magnetic shear $s(r)$ is determined exclusively by the sign of the parameter $\\alpha$.\n    -   If $\\alpha > 0$: The shear $s(r)$ is positive for all $r>0$. This corresponds to a \"positive\" or \"normal\" shear configuration, where the safety factor $q(r)$ is a monotonically increasing function of the minor radius. The magnetic field-line pitch increases away from the axis.\n    -   If $\\alpha = 0$: The shear $s(r)$ is identically zero for all $r$. This is a \"zero shear\" configuration, where $q(r) = q_0$ is constant across the plasma radius.\n    -   If $\\alpha < 0$: The shear $s(r)$ is negative for all $r>0$. This corresponds to a \"negative\" shear configuration, where $q(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of the radius.\n\n    The magnitude of the shear is also controlled by $\\alpha$. For a fixed radius $r$, a larger magnitude of $\\alpha$ generally leads to a larger magnitude of shear, $|s(r)|$.\n    -   In the core ($r \\rightarrow 0$): $\\lim_{r\\to 0} s(r) = \\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{2 \\alpha r^2}{q_0 + \\alpha r^2} = 0$. The shear is always zero on the magnetic axis for any smooth $q$ profile with a finite derivative at the origin, which this profile satisfies.\n    -   At the edge ($r=a$): $s(a) = \\frac{2 \\alpha a^2}{q_0 + \\alpha a^2} = \\frac{2 \\alpha a^2}{q(a)}$. The edge shear is directly proportional to $\\alpha$ and $a^2$.\n\n2.  **Transition from Positive to Reversed Shear and Physical Constraints:**\n    For the given parabolic profile, $q(r) = q_0 + \\alpha r^2$, the term \"reversed shear\" must be interpreted as a purely negative shear profile, since this functional form cannot produce a non-monotonic $q(r)$ with an off-axis minimum (the hallmark of a true reversed-shear equilibrium). The transition described occurs as $\\alpha$ passes through $0$.\n    -   For $\\alpha > 0$, we have a positive shear profile.\n    -   As $\\alpha \\to 0^+$, the shear profile flattens towards $s(r)=0$.\n    -   At $\\alpha=0$, we have zero shear.\n    -   For $\\alpha < 0$, we enter the negative shear regime. The problem text refers to this as \"reversed shear.\" The safety factor $q(r)$ now decreases from its maximum value $q_0$ at the center.\n\n    A critical physical constraint arises when $\\alpha < 0$. The safety factor $q(r)$ must remain positive throughout the plasma, i.e., $q(r) > 0$ for $r \\in [0, a]$. Since $q(r)$ is a monotonically decreasing function for $\\alpha < 0$, its minimum value occurs at the edge, $r=a$. Thus, we must enforce the condition $q(a) > 0$.\n    $$\n    q(a) = q_0 + \\alpha a^2 > 0\n    $$\n    This inequality places a lower bound on the value of $\\alpha$:\n    $$\n    \\alpha a^2 > -q_0 \\implies \\alpha > -\\frac{q_0}{a^2}\n    $$\n    Therefore, a physically valid negative shear profile is only possible for values of $\\alpha$ in the range $-\\frac{q_0}{a^2} < \\alpha < 0$. If $\\alpha \\le -\\frac{q_0}{a^2}$, the safety factor would become zero or negative at or before the plasma edge, which corresponds to a disruption or a breakdown of the nested flux surface model.",

A common and useful expression for $q(\\psi)$ in an axisymmetric system is derived from its fundamental definition as the differential ratio of toroidal flux $\\Phi$ to poloidal flux $\\Psi$:\n$$q(\\psi) = \\frac{d\\Phi}{d\\Psi}$$\nFor an axisymmetric equilibrium, this can be written as an integral over a poloidal cross-section of the flux surface:\n$$q(\\psi) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\oint \\frac{B_\\phi}{R B_p} dl_p$$\nwhere $dl_p$ is the element of arc length along the poloidal contour of the flux surface $\\psi = \\text{const}$, $B_\\phi$ is the toroidal magnetic field, $B_p$ is the poloidal magnetic field, and $R$ is the major radius.\n\nUsing the given expressions, $B_{\\phi} = B_{0} R_{0} / R$ and $B_{p} = |\\nabla\\psi|/R$, we substitute into the integral for $q(\\psi)$:\n$$q(\\psi) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\oint \\frac{(B_0 R_0 / R)}{R (|\\nabla\\psi|/R)} dl_p = \\frac{B_0 R_0}{2\\pi} \\oint \\frac{dl_p}{R |\\nabla\\psi|}$$\nWe are interested in the behavior of $q(\\psi)$ as a flux surface approaches the separatrix from the inside, i.e., $\\psi \\to \\psi_{\\text{sep}}^-$. As this limit is taken, the flux surface contour passes arbitrarily close to the X-point.\n\nAt the X-point, the poloidal magnetic field is null, i.e., $\\mathbf{B}_p = 0$. Since $\\mathbf{B}_p = \\frac{\\nabla\\psi \\times \\mathbf{e}_\\phi}{R}$, this implies $\\nabla\\psi=0$ at the X-point. The local model for $\\psi$ near the X-point is given as $\\psi(x,y) = \\psi_{\\text{sep}} + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}(x^2 - y^2)$. The gradient is $\\nabla\\psi = (\\kappa x, -\\kappa y)$, and its magnitude is $|\\nabla\\psi| = \\kappa \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = \\kappa r$, where $r$ is the distance from the X-point in the local $(x,y)$ plane. As one approaches the X-point ($r \\to 0$), we have $|\\nabla\\psi| \\to 0$.\n\nThe integral for $q(\\psi)$ is taken along the contour of the flux surface. As $\\psi \\to \\psi_{\\text{sep}}^-$, the part of this contour near the X-point makes the dominant contribution to the integral because the integrand $\\frac{1}{R |\\nabla\\psi|}$ diverges as $|\\nabla\\psi| \\to 0$. Let's analyze this contribution. Near the X-point, $R$ is approximately constant, $R \\approx R_X$, where $R_X$ is the major radius of the X-point. The integral's behavior is dominated by $\\int \\frac{dl_p}{|\\nabla\\psi|}$.\n\nThe flux surface is defined by $\\psi = \\psi_{\\text{sep}} - \\Delta\\psi$, which in the local model becomes $\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(x^2-y^2) = -\\Delta\\psi$, or $y^2 - x^2 = \\frac{2\\Delta\\psi}{\\kappa}$. Let $C^2 = \\frac{2\\Delta\\psi}{\\kappa}$. The equation is $y^2 = x^2 + C^2$, which describes a hyperbola whose closest approach to the origin (the X-point) is at $(0, \\pm C)$. The distance of closest approach is $r_{min} = C = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\Delta\\psi}{\\kappa}}$.\n\nThe arc length element is $dl_p = \\sqrt{1 + (dx/dy)^2} dy$. From $y^2-x^2=C^2$, we get $2y\\,dy - 2x\\,dx = 0$, so $dx/dy = y/x$. Thus, $dl_p = \\sqrt{1 + y^2/x^2} dy = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{x} dy$. The integrand is $\\frac{dl_p}{|\\nabla\\psi|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{x \\cdot \\kappa\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa x}$. Substituting $x = \\sqrt{y^2-C^2}$, the integral segment becomes $\\int \\frac{1}{\\kappa \\sqrt{y^2-C^2}} dy$. This integral evaluates to $\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\text{arccosh}(y/C)$.\n\nA simpler and more intuitive argument is that the integrand behaves like $1/r$ near the X-point, while the length of the path segment over which $r$ is small is finite. The minimum distance is $r_{min} \\sim \\sqrt{\\Delta\\psi}$. A simplified integral of the form $\\int_{r_{min}} \\frac{dl}{r}$ will exhibit a logarithmic dependence on $r_{min}$. That is, the integral behaves as $-\\ln(r_{min}) \\sim -\\ln(\\sqrt{\\Delta\\psi}) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln(\\Delta\\psi)$. As $\\Delta\\psi \\to 0^+$, $-\\ln(\\Delta\\psi) \\to \\infty$. Therefore, the integral for $q(\\psi)$ diverges logarithmically.\n\nConclusion on $q_{\\text{sep}}$: The safety factor at the separatrix, $q_{\\text{sep}}$, is formally infinite. This is a direct consequence of the poloidal magnetic field vanishing at the X-point, which makes the poloidal transit time for a field line infinite.\n\nNext, we consider $q_{95}$. Since $q(\\psi)$ is infinite at the separatrix, it is not a useful parameter for characterizing the edge operational boundary of a diverted plasma. Instead, a standardized value is used: $q_{95}$. This is defined as the safety factor on the flux surface that encloses $95\\%$ of the total poloidal flux between the magnetic axis and the separatrix. This is conventionally expressed using the normalized poloidal flux, $\\psi_N$:\n$$\\psi_N = \\frac{\\psi - \\psi_{\\text{axis}}}{\\psi_{\\text{sep}} - \\psi_{\\text{axis}}}$$\nHere, $\\psi_N=0$ on the magnetic axis and $\\psi_N=1$ at the separatrix. By definition, $q_{95}$ is the value $q(\\psi)$ where $\\psi_N=0.95$. This surface is, by definition, a closed flux surface located inside the separatrix, so it does not include the X-point or the open-field-line region (Scrape-Off Layer). Consequently, $q_{95}$ is a well-defined, finite number.\n\nTo obtain $q_{95}$ experimentally, one cannot measure it directly. It must be computed from a reconstruction of the plasma's magnetic equilibrium. This is done using sophisticated computational codes, the most common of which is EFIT (Equilibrium Fitting). This code solves the Grad-Shafranov equation for the poloidal flux $\\psi(R,Z)$, iteratively adjusting the source terms (which depend on the plasma pressure and current profiles) to achieve the best fit to a wide array of experimental measurements. These measurements crucially include:\n1.  Data from magnetic pickup coils and flux loops located outside the plasma, which constrain the boundary shape and total current.\n2.  Internal measurements that constrain the current density profile, $j(R,Z)$. The most important diagnostic for this is Motional Stark Effect (MSE) spectroscopy, which measures the local magnetic field pitch angle inside the hot plasma core.\nFrom the reconstructed $\\psi(R,Z)$ map, the $q(\\psi)$ profile is calculated, and the value at $\\psi_N=0.95$ is identified as $q_{95}$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $q_{\\text{sep}}$ is formally infinite because the poloidal magnetic field vanishes at the X-point, producing a logarithmic divergence of the poloidal transits; $q_{95}$ is defined on the closed flux surface containing $95\\%$ of the poloidal flux inside the separatrix (i.e., $\\psi_{N}=0.95$ with $\\psi_{N} = (\\psi - \\psi_{\\text{axis}})/(\\psi_{\\text{sep}} - \\psi_{\\text{axis}})$) and is finite; it is obtained from equilibrium reconstruction (e.g., EFIT constrained by magnetic and Motional Stark Effect measurements) and excludes the open-field-line region outside the separatrix.**\nThis statement is entirely correct. It accurately describes the infinite value of $q_{\\text{sep}}$ and the reason for it (logarithmic divergence due to $B_p \\to 0$). It provides the correct, standard definition of $q_{95}$ in terms of normalized poloidal flux. It also correctly identifies the method of determination via equilibrium reconstruction (EFIT) using key diagnostics (magnetics, MSE) and correctly states that $q_{95}$ is defined on closed flux surfaces.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $q_{\\text{sep}}$ equals the edge safety factor $q_{a}$ and is approximately equal to $q_{95}$ in a diverted plasma; $q_{95}$ is measured at the divertor strike points using Langmuir probes, and the presence of the X-point generally reduces $q_{95}$ compared to a limiter plasma.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, $q_{\\text{sep}}$ is infinite, not finite and equal to some $q_a$ or $q_{95}$. Second, $q_{95}$ is not measured with Langmuir probes, which measure local plasma properties (like density and temperature) at a solid surface in the open-field-line region. They provide no information about the magnetic field structure on closed flux surfaces.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $q_{\\text{sep}}$ is zero because field lines become open at the separatrix; $q_{95}$ cannot be defined in diverted equilibria since the separatrix is not a closed surface.**\nThis statement is incorrect. $q_{\\text{sep}}$ is infinite, not zero. A value of $q=0$ would imply an infinite number of poloidal turns per toroidal turn, which is physically backwards. The safety factor definition applies to closed field line regions, and its value is determined by taking the limit from within this region. The claim that $q_{95}$ cannot be defined is also false; it is specifically defined *because* a diverted equilibrium has a separatrix, to provide a practical and well-defined measure of the edge safety factor.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $q_{\\text{sep}}$ is finite and given by $q_{\\text{sep}} = R_{0}B_{0}/(\\kappa a)$, where $a$ is the minor radius; $q_{95}$ is defined as the average safety factor over the outer $5\\%$ of minor radius and depends only on the toroidal magnetic field profile.**\nThis statement is incorrect. $q_{\\text{sep}}$ is infinite, not finite. The provided formula is spurious. The definition of $q_{95}$ is also misstated; it is a point value on a specific flux surface ($\\psi_N=0.95$), not an average over a radial zone. Finally, the claim that it depends only on the toroidal field is a severe error; the safety factor is critically dependent on the poloidal field, which is generated by the plasma current, i.e., $q \\propto B_\\phi / B_p$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
