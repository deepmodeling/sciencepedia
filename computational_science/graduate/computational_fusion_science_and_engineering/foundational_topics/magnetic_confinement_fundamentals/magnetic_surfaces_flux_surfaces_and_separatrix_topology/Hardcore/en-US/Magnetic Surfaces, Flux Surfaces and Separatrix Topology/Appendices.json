            "solution": "The problem requires the construction of a magnetic flux function, $\\psi(R,Z)$, for a given axisymmetric magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$, and the subsequent verification that the field is orthogonal to the gradient of this function.\n\nThe fundamental principle underlying this problem is derived from Maxwell's equations for magnetostatics, specifically the divergence-free condition for the magnetic field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. For an axisymmetric field in cylindrical coordinates $(R, \\phi, Z)$, this condition simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}(R B_R) + \\frac{\\partial B_Z}{\\partial Z} = 0 $$\nThe poloidal field components can be derived from a scalar poloidal flux function, $\\psi(R,Z)$, using the definitions:\n$$ B_R = \\frac{1}{R} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial Z}, \\qquad B_Z = -\\frac{1}{R} \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial R} $$\nSubstituting these into the divergence condition confirms they satisfy it identically for a sufficiently smooth function $\\psi$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}\\left(R \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial Z}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Z}\\left(-\\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial R}\\right) = \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial R \\partial Z} - \\frac{1}{R}\\frac{\\partial^2\\psi}{\\partial Z \\partial R} = 0 $$\nThus, we can construct $\\psi$ by integrating these relations. From the definition of $B_R$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial Z} = R B_R(R,Z) = R \\left( \\frac{2\\kappa Z}{R} \\right) = 2\\kappa Z $$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to $Z$ yields $\\psi(R,Z)$, introducing an arbitrary function of $R$, let's call it $f(R)$:\n$$ \\psi(R,Z) = \\int 2\\kappa Z \\, dZ = \\kappa Z^2 + f(R) $$\nNext, we use the definition of $B_Z$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial R} = -R B_Z(R,Z) = -R \\left( \\frac{2\\kappa(R - R_x)}{R} \\right) = -2\\kappa(R - R_x) $$\nWe also differentiate our expression for $\\psi$ with respect to $R$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial R} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial R}(\\kappa Z^2 + f(R)) = \\frac{df(R)}{dR} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial R}$ allows us to determine $f(R)$:\n$$ \\frac{df(R)}{dR} = -2\\kappa(R - R_x) $$\nIntegrating with respect to $R$:\n$$ f(R) = \\int -2\\kappa(R - R_x) \\, dR = -2\\kappa \\left( \\frac{R^2}{2} - R_x R \\right) + C = -\\kappa R^2 + 2\\kappa R_x R + C $$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration.
