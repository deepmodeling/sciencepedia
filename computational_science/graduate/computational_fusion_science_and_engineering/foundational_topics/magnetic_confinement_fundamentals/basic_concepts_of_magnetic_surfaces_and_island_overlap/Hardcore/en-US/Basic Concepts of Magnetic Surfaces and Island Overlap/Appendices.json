            "solution": "This problem requires the derivation of the safety factor $q(r)$ and the magnetic shear $s(r)$ for a model tokamak equilibrium. The solution proceeds in three steps as requested.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the safety factor $q(r)$.\nA magnetic field line is a curve in space that is everywhere tangent to the magnetic field vector $\\boldsymbol{B}$. Its trajectory is described by the differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{B_r} = \\frac{r d\\theta}{B_\\theta} = \\frac{R d\\phi}{B_\\phi}\n$$\nIn the given model, the magnetic field is $\\boldsymbol{B} = B_{\\phi}(R)\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{\\phi} + B_{\\theta}(r)\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_{\\theta}$. The radial component $B_r$ is zero. This implies that $dr=0$ for a field line, meaning field lines lie on nested circular surfaces of constant minor radius $r$. These are the magnetic surfaces.\n\nFrom the B-line-following equation, we relate the poloidal angle $\\theta$ and toroidal angle $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{r d\\theta}{B_\\theta(r)} = \\frac{R d\\phi}{B_\\phi(R)}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to find the change in toroidal angle $d\\phi$ for a given change in poloidal angle $d\\theta$ as a field line is traced:\n$$\nd\\phi = \\frac{B_\\phi(R)}{R B_\\theta(r)} r d\\theta\n$$\nThe safety factor $q(r)$ is defined as the number of toroidal turns a field line makes for one complete poloidal turn. Mathematically, for one poloidal turn ($\\Delta\\theta = 2\\pi$), the field line advances by $\\Delta\\phi = q(r) \\cdot 2\\pi$. We integrate the above relation over one poloidal circuit:\n$$\nq(r) \\cdot 2\\pi = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{B_\\phi(R)}{R B_\\theta(r)} r d\\theta\n$$\nThe major radius $R$ is related to the reference major radius $R_0$ and the minor radius coordinate $r$ by $R = R_0 + r\\cos\\theta$. The toroidal field is given as $B_\\phi(R) = B_0 R_0 / R$. The problem specifies using the large aspect ratio approximation, $r \\ll R_0$. Under this approximation, we can consider $R \\approx R_0$ and thus $B_\\phi \\approx B_0$ for a given flux surface at radius $r$. The integrand then becomes approximately constant with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\nq(r) \\cdot 2\\pi \\approx \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{B_0}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)} r d\\theta = \\frac{r B_0}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\theta = \\frac{r B_0}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)} (2\\pi)\n$$\nDividing by $2\\pi$, we obtain the approximate expression for the safety factor:\n$$\nq(r) \\approx \\frac{r B_\\phi}{R_0 B_\\theta}\n$$\nwhere we use $B_\\phi$ to represent the toroidal field on the magnetic axis, i.e., $B_0$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nStep 2: Calculation of the magnetic shear $s(r)$.\nThe magnetic shear is defined as $s(r) \\equiv \\frac{r}{q} \\frac{dq}{dr}$. To compute this, we first need to determine the poloidal field $B_\\theta(r)$ from the given toroidal current density profile $j_\\phi(r)$. We use the integral form of Ampère's law, $\\oint \\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{l} = \\mu_0 I_{enc}$, on a circular loop of radius $r$ in the poloidal plane.\n$$\n\\oint \\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{l} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} B_\\theta(r) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_\\theta \\cdot (r d\\theta \\hat{\\boldsymbol{e}}_\\theta) = 2\\pi r B_\\theta(r)\n$$\nThe enclosed current $I_{enc} = I_p(r)$ is the integral of the current density $j_\\phi(r')$ over the circular area of radius $r$:\n$$\nI_p(r) = \\int_0^r j_\\phi(r') 2\\pi r' dr'\n$$\nSubstituting the given profile $j_{\\phi}(r') = j_{0}\\left[1 - \\left(\\frac{r'}{a}\\right)^{2}\\right]$:\n$$\nI_p(r) = 2\\pi j_0 \\int_0^r \\left( r' - \\frac{r'^3}{a^2} \\right) dr' = 2\\pi j_0 \\left[ \\frac{r'^2}{2} - \\frac{r'^4}{4a^2} \\right]_0^r = 2\\pi j_0 \\left( \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4a^2} \\right)\n$$\nFrom Ampère's law, $2\\pi r B_\\theta(r) = \\mu_0 I_p(r)$, so:\n$$\nB_\\theta(r) = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_p(r)}{2\\pi r} = \\frac{\\mu_0}{2\\pi r} \\cdot 2\\pi j_0 \\left( \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4a^2} \\right) = \\mu_0 j_0 \\left( \\frac{r}{2} - \\frac{r^3}{4a^2} \\right)\n$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $B_\\theta(r)$ into our formula for $q(r)$:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{r B_0}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)} = \\frac{r B_0}{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0 \\left( \\frac{r}{2} - \\frac{r^3}{4a^2} \\right)} = \\frac{B_0}{R_0 \\mu_0 j_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{r^2}{4a^2} \\right)}\n$$\nTo compute the shear, we can use the logarithmic derivative form $s(r) = \\frac{r}{q}\\frac{dq}{dr} = r \\frac{d}{dr}(\\ln q)$.\nUsing $q(r) \\approx \\frac{r B_0}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)}$, we have $\\ln q(r) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{B_0}{R_0}\\right) + \\ln r - \\ln B_\\theta(r)$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{q}\\frac{dq}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}(\\ln q) = \\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{B_\\theta(r)}\\frac{dB_\\theta}{dr}\n$$\nSo, the shear is $s(r) = r\\left(\\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{B_\\theta}\\frac{dB_\\theta}{dr}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{r}{B_\\theta}\\frac{dB_\\theta}{dr}$.\nWe need the derivative of $B_\\theta(r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dB_\\theta}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ \\mu_0 j_0 \\left( \\frac{r}{2} - \\frac{r^3}{4a^2} \\right) \\right] = \\mu_0 j_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3r^2}{4a^2} \\right)\n$$\nNow we compute the term $\\frac{r}{B_\\theta}\\frac{dB_\\theta}{dr}$:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{B_\\theta}\\frac{dB_\\theta}{dr} = \\frac{r}{\\mu_0 j_0 \\left( \\frac{r}{2} - \\frac{r^3}{4a^2} \\right)} \\mu_0 j_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3r^2}{4a^2} \\right) = \\frac{r \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3r^2}{4a^2} \\right)}{r \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{r^2}{4a^2} \\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{2a^2-3r^2}{4a^2}}{\\frac{2a^2-r^2}{4a^2}} = \\frac{2a^2-3r^2}{2a^2-r^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for shear:\n$$\ns(r) = 1 - \\frac{2a^2-3r^2}{2a^2-r^2} = \\frac{(2a^2-r^2) - (2a^2-3r^2)}{2a^2-r^2} = \\frac{2r^2}{2a^2-r^2}\n$$\nThe shear depends only on the relative radial position $r/a$, not on the absolute machine parameters $a$, $R_0$, $B_0$, or the current density scale $j_0$.\n\nStep 3: Evaluation of $s$ at $r = a/2$.\nWe substitute $r = a/2$ into the derived expression for $s(r)$:\n$$\ns\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2(a/2)^2}{2a^2 - (a/2)^2} = \\frac{2(a^2/4)}{2a^2 - a^2/4} = \\frac{a^2/2}{\\frac{8a^2-a^2}{4}} = \\frac{a^2/2}{7a^2/4}\n$$\n$$\ns\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{a^2}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{7a^2} = \\frac{4}{14} = \\frac{2}{7}\n$$\nThe problem requests a numerical answer rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\ns\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{7} \\approx 0.285714...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $0.2857$.

            "solution": "The problem provides a Hamiltonian description of magnetic field lines in a toroidally confined plasma. The solution requires finding the fixed points of the perturbed flow, classifying them, and analyzing their geometric displacement under a change of parameters.\n\nThe total Hamiltonian is given by the sum of an unperturbed, integrable part $H_{0}(\\psi)$ and a single-helicity perturbation:\n$$H(\\psi, \\theta, \\zeta) = H_{0}(\\psi) - \\epsilon \\cos(m(\\theta - \\theta_{s}) - n\\zeta)$$\nThe field-line equations of motion are canonical:\n$$ \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\zeta} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\theta} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\zeta} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\psi} $$\nThe unperturbed rotational transform is $\\iota(\\psi) = d\\theta/d\\zeta|_{H_0} = \\partial H_0 / \\partial \\psi$. The perturbation creates a magnetic island chain near the rational surface $\\psi = \\psi_{0}$ where $\\iota(\\psi_{0}) = n/m$.\n\nTo analyze the dynamics near this resonance, we transform to a coordinate system rotating with the helical phase of the perturbation. Let the helical angle be $\\phi = \\theta - (n/m)\\zeta$. Using a generating function $F(\\phi, \\psi, \\zeta) = \\psi(\\phi + (n/m)\\zeta)$, the new Hamiltonian $K$ is:\n$$ K(\\psi, \\phi) = H + \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial \\zeta} = H_{0}(\\psi) - \\epsilon \\cos(m(\\phi - \\theta_{s})) + \\psi\\frac{n}{m} $$\nThe argument of the cosine becomes $m(\\theta - \\theta_s) - n\\zeta = m(\\phi + (n/m)\\zeta - \\theta_s) - n\\zeta = m(\\phi - \\theta_s)$. The new Hamiltonian $K$ is independent of the toroidal angle $\\zeta$, and is therefore a conserved quantity. The trajectories in the $(\\psi, \\phi)$ plane are contours of constant $K$.\n\nThe equations of motion in the new coordinates are:\n$$ \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\zeta} = -\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\phi} = -m\\epsilon \\sin(m(\\phi - \\theta_{s})) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\zeta} = \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial \\psi} = \\frac{\\partial H_{0}}{\\partial \\psi} - \\frac{n}{m} = \\iota(\\psi) - \\frac{n}{m} $$\nFixed points in this rotating frame correspond to equilibrium points where $d\\psi/d\\zeta = 0$ and $d\\phi/d\\zeta = 0$.\nThe condition $d\\phi/d\\zeta = 0$ implies $\\iota(\\psi) - n/m = 0$, which means the fixed points are located radially at the rational surface $\\psi = \\psi_{0}$.\nThe condition $d\\psi/d\\zeta = 0$ implies $-m\\epsilon \\sin(m(\\phi - \\theta_{s})) = 0$. This gives the condition on the helical angle $\\phi$:\n$$ m(\\phi - \\theta_{s}) = k\\pi, \\quad \\text{for any integer } k $$\nThe poloidal angle $\\theta$ on a Poincaré section at a fixed toroidal angle $\\zeta = \\zeta_{0}$ is found by transforming back: $\\theta = \\phi + (n/m)\\zeta_{0}$.

Let $\\delta\\psi = \\psi - \\psi_{0}$ and $\\delta\\phi = \\phi - \\phi_k$. We expand the equations of motion to first order. Near $\\psi_0$, we approximate $\\iota(\\psi) \\approx \\iota(\\psi_{0}) + \\iota'(\\psi_{0})(\\psi - \\psi_{0}) = n/m + \\iota'(\\psi_{0})\\delta\\psi$, where $\\iota' = d\\iota/d\\psi$.\nThe linearized system is:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\delta\\psi)}{d\\zeta} \\approx -m^2\\epsilon\\cos(m(\\phi_k - \\theta_s))\\delta\\phi $$\n$$ \\frac{d(\\delta\\phi)}{d\\zeta} \\approx \\iota'(\\psi_0)\\delta\\psi $$\nAt the fixed points, $m(\\phi_k - \\theta_s) = k\\pi$, so $\\cos(m(\\phi_k - \\theta_s)) = (-1)^k$.

In typical tokamaks, magnetic shear is negative, $\\iota'(\\psi_0) < 0$. Assuming this standard case:\n- If $k$ is even ($k=2j$ for integer $j$), the coefficient is positive: $-\\iota'(\\psi_0)m^2\\epsilon > 0$. The equation is $d^2(\\delta\\phi)/d\\zeta^2 = \\gamma^2\\delta\\phi$, which has exponentially growing/decaying solutions. These are hyperbolic fixed points (X-points).\nTheir poloidal angles are $\\theta_{\\mathrm{X}} = \\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{2j\\pi}{m}$.\n- If $k$ is odd ($k=2j+1$ for integer $j$), the coefficient is negative: $\\iota'(\\psi_0)m^2\\epsilon < 0$. The equation is $d^2(\\delta\\phi)/d\\zeta^2 = -\\omega^2\\delta\\phi$, which has oscillatory solutions. These are elliptic fixed points (O-points).\nTheir poloidal angles are $\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{(2j+1)\\pi}{m}$.\n(If $\\iota'(\\psi_0) > 0$, the roles of even and odd $k$ would be reversed, but the relative positions are unchanged).\n\nThe smallest positive poloidal-angle displacement $\\Delta\\theta$ between an O-point and an adjacent X-point can be found by taking the difference between their angles. Let's take the O-point for $j=0$, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{\\pi}{m}$, and the adjacent X-point for $j=0$, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{X}} = \\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m}$.\n$$ \\Delta\\theta = |\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{X}}| = \\left|\\left(\\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{\\pi}{m}\\right) - \\left(\\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m}\\right)\\right| = \\frac{\\pi}{m} $$\nThis corresponds to half the distance between two consecutive X-points (or O-points), which are separated by $2\\pi/m$.\n\nNow, we predict the effect of changing the source poloidal phase by $\\Delta\\theta_{s} = \\pi/m$. The new source phase is $\\theta_{s}' = \\theta_{s} + \\pi/m$.\nThe original O-points were located at angles $\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}} = \\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{(2j+1)\\pi}{m}$.\nThe new O-point locations, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}'$, are found by replacing $\\theta_s$ with $\\theta_s'$ in the derived formula:\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}' = \\theta_{s}' + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{(2j'+1)\\pi}{m} = \\left(\\theta_{s} + \\frac{\\pi}{m}\\right) + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{(2j'+1)\\pi}{m} $$\n$$ \\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}' = \\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{(2j'+2)\\pi}{m} $$\nThis expression for the new O-point locations $\\theta_{\\mathrm{O}}'$ is identical to the expression for the original X-point locations $\\theta_{\\mathrm{X}}$. The phase shift effectively swaps the positions of the O-points and X-points.\nThe problem asks for the smallest positive displacement between an original O-point location and a new O-point location. This is equivalent to finding the smallest positive displacement between an original O-point and an original X-point, which we have already calculated.\nTo formally verify, we compute the displacement between an original O-point (indexed by $j$) and a new O-point (indexed by $j'$):\n$$ |\\theta_{\\mathrm{O,j}} - \\theta'_{\\mathrm{O,j'}}| = \\left|\\left(\\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{(2j+1)\\pi}{m}\\right) - \\left(\\theta_{s} + \\frac{n\\zeta_{0}}{m} + \\frac{(2j'+2)\\pi}{m}\\right)\\right| $$\n$$ = \\left|\\frac{(2j+1)\\pi - (2j'+2)\\pi}{m}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{(2(j-j') - 1)\\pi}{m}\\right| $$\nTo find the smallest positive displacement, we must find the integer $k = j-j'$ that minimizes the absolute value of $2k-1$. The term $2k-1$ is always an odd integer. Its smallest non-zero absolute value is $1$, which occurs for $k=0$ (giving $-1$) or $k=1$ (giving $1$).\nTherefore, the smallest positive displacement is $\\frac{\\pi}{m}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction and analysis of a symplectic Poincaré map for magnetic field lines in a toroidal system. The analysis involves both numerical verification of the symplectic property and an analytical check of the Chirikov island overlap criterion.\n\n### Principle-Based Algorithm Design\n\nThe solution is developed in four main stages: (1) defining the Hamiltonian system and the splitting method, (2) constructing the one-step symplectic integrator, (3) implementing the full Poincaré map and the numerical estimation of its Jacobian, and (4) calculating the analytical Chirikov overlap condition.\n\n#### 1. Hamiltonian System and Splitting\n\nThe dynamics of the magnetic field lines are governed by a Hamiltonian system in straight-field-line coordinates $(\\psi, \\theta)$, where $\\psi$ is the flux coordinate, $\\theta$ is the poloidal angle, and the toroidal angle $\\phi$ acts as the time-like variable. The canonical equations of motion are:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\psi}\\,, \\qquad \\frac{d\\psi}{d\\phi} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\theta}\n$$\nThe specified Hamiltonian is $H(\\psi, \\theta, \\phi) = H_0(\\psi) + H_p(\\psi, \\theta, \\phi)$, where the problem statement uses the notation $H_B$ for the perturbation, which we will denote as $H_p$ to avoid confusion with subflow nomenclature. It is split into an integrable part $H_A(\\psi) = H_0(\\psi)$ and a non-integrable, $\\phi$-dependent perturbation $H_p(\\theta, \\phi)$:\n$$\nH_A(\\psi) = \\int^{\\psi} \\iota(\\tilde{\\psi})\\,d\\tilde{\\psi} = \\int^{\\psi} (\\iota_0 + s\\tilde{\\psi})\\,d\\tilde{\\psi} = \\iota_0\\psi + \\frac{1}{2}s\\psi^2 + C\n$$\n$$\nH_p(\\theta, \\phi) = \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\varepsilon_k \\cos(m_k\\theta - n_k\\phi)\n$$\nThe constant of integration $C$ in $H_A$ is irrelevant as it vanishes when taking derivatives. The core idea of a splitting method is to decompose the full evolution operator over a step $\\Delta\\phi$ into a composition of operators for the simpler, exactly solvable sub-dynamics governed by $H_A$ and $H_p$ individually. We will use a symmetric Strang splitting, which is a second-order accurate symplectic method.\n\n#### 2. The Symplectic One-Step Map\n\nThe map $\\mathcal{M}(\\Delta\\phi)$ that advances the system from $(\\psi, \\theta)$ at $\\phi_j$ to $(\\psi', \\theta')$ at $\\phi_{j+1} = \\phi_j + \\Delta\\phi$ is constructed as a symmetric composition of two sub-maps: $\\mathcal{S}_A$, the flow due to $H_A$, a shear in $\\theta$; and $\\mathcal{K}_p$, the flow due to $H_p$, a kick in $\\psi$. The Strang composition for one step is $\\mathcal{M}_j = \\mathcal{S}_A(\\Delta\\phi/2) \\circ \\mathcal{K}_p(\\phi_j, \\Delta\\phi) \\circ \\mathcal{S}_A(\\Delta\\phi/2)$.\n\n**Sub-map $\\mathcal{S}_A(\\delta\\phi)$ (Shear):**\nThis map evolves the system under $H_A(\\psi)$ for a step $\\delta\\phi$. The equations are $\\frac{d\\psi}{d\\phi} = 0$ and $\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\phi} = \\frac{\\partial H_A}{\\partial\\psi} = \\iota(\\psi) = \\iota_0 + s\\psi$.\nThe exact solution is a shear transformation:\n$$\n\\psi' = \\psi, \\qquad \\theta' = \\theta + (\\iota_0 + s\\psi)\\delta\\phi\n$$\n\n**Sub-map $\\mathcal{K}_p(\\phi_j, \\Delta\\phi)$ (Kick):**\nThis map evolves the system under $H_p(\\theta, \\phi)$ for a step $\\Delta\\phi$, from $\\phi_j$ to $\\phi_j+\\Delta\\phi$. The equations are $\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\phi} = 0$ and $\\frac{d\\psi}{d\\phi} = -\\frac{\\partial H_p}{\\partial\\theta} = \\sum_k \\varepsilon_k m_k \\sin(m_k\\theta - n_k\\phi)$.\nSince $\\theta$ is constant, we can integrate with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$\n\\theta' = \\theta, \\qquad \\psi' = \\psi + \\int_{\\phi_j}^{\\phi_j+\\Delta\\phi} \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\varepsilon_k m_k \\sin(m_k\\theta - n_k\\phi') d\\phi'\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields the change in $\\psi$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\psi = \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{\\varepsilon_k m_k}{n_k} \\Big[ \\cos(m_k\\theta - n_k\\phi') \\Big]_{\\phi_j}^{\\phi_j+\\Delta\\phi}\n$$\n$$\n\\psi' = \\psi + \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{\\varepsilon_k m_k}{n_k} \\Big( \\cos(m_k\\theta - n_k(\\phi_j+\\Delta\\phi)) - \\cos(m_k\\theta - n_k\\phi_j) \\Big)\n$$\nThis assumes $n_k \\neq 0$, which is true for all test cases.\n\n**Composed One-Step Map $\\mathcal{M}_j$:**\nLet the state at $\\phi_j$ be $(\\psi_j, \\theta_j)$.\n1.  **First Shear:** Apply $\\mathcal{S}_A(\\Delta\\phi/2)$:\n    $$\n    \\psi^{(1)} = \\psi_j, \\qquad \\theta^{(1)} = (\\theta_j + (\\iota_0 + s\\psi_j)\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2}) \\pmod{2\\pi}\n    $$\n2.  **Kick:** Apply $\\mathcal{K}_p(\\phi_j, \\Delta\\phi)$ to $(\\psi^{(1)}, \\theta^{(1)})$:\n    $$\n    \\psi^{(2)} = \\psi^{(1)} + \\sum_{k=1}^{2} \\frac{\\varepsilon_k m_k}{n_k} \\Big( \\cos(m_k\\theta^{(1)} - n_k(\\phi_j+\\Delta\\phi)) - \\cos(m_k\\theta^{(1)} - n_k\\phi_j) \\Big)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\theta^{(2)} = \\theta^{(1)}\n    $$\n3.  **Second Shear:** Apply $\\mathcal{S}_A(\\Delta\\phi/2)$ to $(\\psi^{(2)}, \\theta^{(2)})$:\n    $$\n    \\psi_{j+1} = \\psi^{(2)}, \\qquad \\theta_{j+1} = (\\theta^{(2)} + (\\iota_0 + s\\psi^{(2)})\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2}) \\pmod{2\\pi}\n    $$\nThis sequence defines the symplectic map for a single step from $\\phi_j$ to $\\phi_{j+1}$.\n\n#### 3. Poincaré Map and Jacobian Verification\n\nThe full stroboscopic Poincaré map $\\mathcal{P}: (\\psi_0, \\theta_0) \\mapsto (\\psi_K, \\theta_K)$ is obtained by iterating the one-step map $\\mathcal{M}_j$ for $K$ steps, starting from $\\phi_0 = 0$. The total toroidal angle traversed is $K\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi$.\n\nTo verify the area-preserving (symplectic) property of $\\mathcal{P}$, we must check that the determinant of its Jacobian matrix is unity.\n$$\nJ = \\frac{\\partial(\\psi_K, \\theta_K)}{\\partial(\\psi_0, \\theta_0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial\\psi_K}{\\partial\\psi_0} & \\frac{\\partial\\psi_K}{\\partial\\theta_0} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\theta_K}{\\partial\\psi_0} & \\frac{\\partial\\theta_K}{\\partial\\theta_0} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are estimated numerically using a second-order central finite difference scheme with a small perturbation $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{f(x+\\delta) - f(x-\\delta)}{2\\delta}\n$$\nFor example, $\\frac{\\partial\\psi_K}{\\partial\\psi_0} \\approx (\\psi_K(\\psi_0+\\delta, \\theta_0) - \\psi_K(\\psi_0-\\delta, \\theta_0)) / (2\\delta)$. Care must be taken when differencing the angle $\\theta_K$, as it is periodic. The difference $\\Delta\\theta_K$ is computed as the shortest angle, for example using `np.angle(np.exp(1j * theta_plus) / np.exp(1j * theta_minus))`. We compute $|\\det(J) - 1|$ at $R$ random points in the domain $[\\psi_{\\min}, \\psi_{\\max}] \\times [0, 2\\pi)$ and report the maximum deviation found.\n\n#### 4. Chirikov Overlap Criterion\n\nThis analytical criterion predicts the onset of widespread chaos due to the overlap of adjacent magnetic island chains.\n1.  **Resonance Location:** The resonance for mode $k$ occurs at $\\psi_{rk}$ where the field line pitch matches the mode helicity: $m_k\\iota(\\psi_{rk}) - n_k = 0$. Using $\\iota(\\psi) = \\iota_0 + s\\psi$, we solve for $\\psi_{rk}$:\n    $$\n    \\psi_{rk} = \\frac{n_k/m_k - \\iota_0}{s}\n    $$\n2.  **Island Half-width:** The width of the island chain in the $\\psi$ coordinate is given by:\n    $$\n    \\delta\\psi_k = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_k}{|s|}}\n    $$\n3.  **Overlap Condition:** Overlap is predicted if the sum of the half-widths of the two island chains is greater than the separation between their resonant surfaces:\n    $$\n    \\delta\\psi_1 + \\delta\\psi_2 > |\\psi_{r1} - \\psi_{r2}|\n    $$\nThis condition is evaluated for each parameter set, yielding a boolean result. For Case A where $\\varepsilon_k=0$, the island widths are zero, so overlap is impossible.",
