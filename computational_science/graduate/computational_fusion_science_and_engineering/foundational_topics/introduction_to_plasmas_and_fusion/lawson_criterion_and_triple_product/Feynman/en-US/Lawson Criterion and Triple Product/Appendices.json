            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part analysis. First, we must derive the expression for the volumetric power loss in a deuterium–tritium (D–T) plasma based on fundamental principles. Second, we must calculate the multiplicative error factor resulting from an incorrect unit conversion in a computational model.\n\nFirst, let us derive the volumetric thermal energy density, $W_{th}$. The plasma consists of electrons and ions (deuterium, D$^{+}$, and tritium, T$^{+}$). Let the number densities of electrons, deuterium ions, and tritium ions be $n_e$, $n_D$, and $n_T$, respectively. The problem states the plasma is fully ionized and quasi-neutral. Quasi-neutrality implies that the total positive charge density equals the negative charge density:\n$$n_e = n_D + n_T$$\nThe total ion density is $n_i = n_D + n_T$. Therefore, for a fully ionized D–T plasma, the electron density equals the total ion density:\n$$n_e = n_i$$\nThe problem specifies that the plasma particles are described by Maxwellian distributions and that we should use the ideal-gas model for internal energy. According to the equipartition theorem, for a particle with three translational degrees of freedom, the average kinetic energy is $\\frac{3}{2} k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the thermodynamic temperature in kelvins.\n\nThe volumetric thermal energy density $W_{th}$ is the sum of the kinetic energies of all particles per unit volume. The problem states that electrons and ions have equal temperatures, so $T_e = T_i = T$.\n$$W_{th} = n_e \\left( \\frac{3}{2} k_B T_e \\right) + n_i \\left( \\frac{3}{2} k_B T_i \\right)$$\nSubstituting $T_e = T_i = T$ and $n_e = n_i$:\n$$W_{th} = n_e \\left( \\frac{3}{2} k_B T \\right) + n_e \\left( \\frac{3}{2} k_B T \\right) = 2 n_e \\left( \\frac{3}{2} k_B T \\right) = 3 n_e k_B T$$\nThis expression can also be written in terms of the total particle density $n_{total} = n_e + n_i = 2n_e$ as $W_{th} = \\frac{3}{2} n_{total} k_B T$.\n\nNext, we define the energy confinement time, $\\tau_E$. It is defined as the ratio of the total stored thermal energy in the plasma to the total power being lost from it.\n$$\\tau_E = \\frac{\\text{Stored Thermal Energy}}{\\text{Power Loss}}$$\nThe volumetric power loss, $P_{loss,vol}$, is the power lost per unit volume. It can be expressed as the ratio of the volumetric thermal energy density $W_{th}$ to the energy confinement time $\\tau_E$.\n$$P_{loss,vol} = \\frac{W_{th}}{\\tau_E}$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $W_{th}$:\n$$P_{loss,vol} = \\frac{3 n_e k_B T}{\\tau_E}$$\nIn SI units, $n_e$ is in $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $k_B$ is in $\\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $T$ is in $\\mathrm{K}$, and $\\tau_E$ is in $\\mathrm{s}$. The resulting unit for $P_{loss,vol}$ is $\\mathrm{J}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is equivalent to $\\mathrm{W}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, as required for volumetric power.\n\nNow, we address the second part of the problem concerning the computational model. The model computes the power loss based on the formula derived, which is proportional to the plasma thermal energy. The plasma \"temperature\" is often specified as an energy, typically in kiloelectronvolts (keV). The quantity $k_B T$ represents this characteristic thermal energy in joules. Let's denote this energy by $\\mathcal{E}$, so $\\mathcal{E} = k_B T$. The power loss formula can be written as:\n$$P_{loss,vol} = \\frac{3 n_e \\mathcal{E}}{\\tau_E}$$\nLet the numerical value of the plasma temperature be $\\theta$ in units of keV. For example, if the temperature is $15\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, then $\\theta = 15$.\nThe computational model expects the input for temperature to be an energy value in joules. The correct procedure is to convert the temperature from keV to joules. Using the given conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$:\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{correct} = \\theta \\, [\\mathrm{keV}] \\times \\frac{1000 \\, \\mathrm{eV}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{keV}} \\times \\frac{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{J}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{eV}}$$\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{correct} = \\theta \\times 10^3 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\, \\mathrm{J}$$\nThe correctly computed power loss, $P_{correct}$, would be:\n$$P_{correct} = \\frac{3 n_e}{\\tau_E} \\mathcal{E}_{correct} = \\frac{3 n_e}{\\tau_E} \\left( \\theta \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-16} \\right)$$\nHowever, the user mistakenly inputs the numerical value of the temperature in keV, $\\theta$, directly into the model. The model interprets this numerical input as being in joules.\n$$\\mathcal{E}_{incorrect} = \\theta \\, \\mathrm{J}$$\nThe incorrectly computed power loss, $P_{incorrect}$, is therefore:\n$$P_{incorrect} = \\frac{3 n_e}{\\tau_E} \\mathcal{E}_{incorrect} = \\frac{3 n_e}{\\tau_E} \\theta$$\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative factor $R$ by which the computed power loss is incorrect. This is the ratio of the incorrect result to the correct result:\n$$R = \\frac{P_{incorrect}}{P_{correct}}$$\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{3 n_e}{\\tau_E} \\theta}{\\frac{3 n_e}{\\tau_E} \\left( \\theta \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-16} \\right)}$$\nThe terms $\\frac{3 n_e}{\\tau_E}$ and $\\theta$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1.602 \\times 10^{-16}}$$\nNow we calculate the numerical value of this dimensionless factor $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{1}{1.602} \\times 10^{16} \\approx 0.6242197 \\times 10^{16} = 6.242197 \\times 10^{15}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$R = 6.242 \\times 10^{15}$$\nThis factor $R$ indicates that the computed power loss is more than $15$ orders of magnitude larger than the correct value due to the unit error.",

It is a standard, formalizable problem in fusion plasma engineering.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe derivation begins with the steady-state power balance equation for the plasma. In a steady state, the total power input to the plasma must equal the total power lost from the plasma.\n$$P_{in} = P_{out}$$\nThe power inputs ($P_{in}$) are the externally supplied auxiliary heating power, $P_{aux}$, and the heating power from fusion-born alpha particles, $P_{\\alpha}$, which are confined and deposit their energy in the plasma. The power output ($P_{out}$) is the total power loss, $P_{loss}$, which includes losses from transport and radiation.\nThe power balance equation is therefore:\n$$P_{aux} + P_{\\alpha} = P_{loss}$$\n\nWe now express each term using the given parameters. The derivation will be done for a uniform plasma of volume $V$.\n1.  **Plasma Thermal Energy Content ($W$) and Loss Power ($P_{loss}$):**\n    The total ion number density is $n = n_D + n_T$. Since $n_D = n_T$, we have $n_D = n/2$ and $n_T = n/2$.\n    Due to quasi-neutrality with singly charged ions, the electron number density $n_e$ is equal to the total ion charge density, so $n_e = n_D + n_T = n$.\n    The total particle density in the plasma is $n_{total} = n_D + n_T + n_e = n/2 + n/2 + n = 2n$.\n    The plasma thermal energy density, assuming Maxwellian distributions and with temperature $T$ given in energy units (e.g., $\\text{keV}$), is $\\frac{3}{2}$ times the particle density times the temperature.\n    Energy density $w = \\frac{3}{2}(n_D + n_T + n_e)T = \\frac{3}{2}(2n)T = 3nT$.\n    The total thermal energy content in a volume $V$ is $W = 3nTV$.\n    The power loss is defined as $P_{loss} = W/\\tau_E$. Substituting the expression for $W$, we get:\n    $$P_{loss} = \\frac{3nTV}{\\tau_E}$$\n\n2.  **Alpha Heating Power ($P_{\\alpha}$):**\n    The volumetric rate of fusion reactions is $R = n_D n_T \\langle\\sigma v\\rangle$.\n    Substituting $n_D = n/2$ and $n_T = n/2$:\n    $R = \\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle = \\frac{n^2}{4}\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle$.\n    Each reaction produces one alpha particle with energy $E_{\\alpha}$. The alpha heating power density is $p_{\\alpha} = R \\cdot E_{\\alpha}$.\n    The total alpha heating power in volume $V$ is:\n    $$P_{\\alpha} = p_{\\alpha}V = \\frac{n^2}{4}\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle E_{\\alpha} V$$\n\n3.  **Auxiliary Heating Power ($P_{aux}$):**\n    $P_{aux}$ is related to the total fusion power $P_{fus}$ through the energy gain factor $Q = P_{fus}/P_{aux}$.\n    The total fusion power density is $p_{fus} = R \\cdot E_{fus} = \\frac{n^2}{4}\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle E_{fus}$.\n    The total fusion power in volume $V$ is $P_{fus} = \\frac{n^2}{4}\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle E_{fus} V$.\n    From the definition of $Q$, we can write $P_{aux}$ as:\n    $$P_{aux} = \\frac{P_{fus}}{Q} = \\frac{1}{Q} \\left( \\frac{n^2}{4}\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle E_{fus} V \\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $P_{aux}$, $P_{\\alpha}$, and $P_{loss}$ back into the power balance equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{Q} \\left( \\frac{n^2}{4}\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle E_{fus} V \\right) + \\frac{n^2}{4}\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle E_{\\alpha} V = \\frac{3nTV}{\\tau_E}$$\nThe volume term $V$ is common to all terms and can be cancelled.\n$$\\frac{n^2}{4}\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle \\left( \\frac{E_{fus}}{Q} + E_{\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{3nT}{\\tau_E}$$\nOur goal is to find an expression for the triple product $nT\\tau_E$. We rearrange the equation to isolate this term.\nFirst, divide both sides by $n$ (assuming $n \\neq 0$):\n$$\\frac{n}{4}\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle \\left( E_{\\alpha} + \\frac{E_{fus}}{Q} \\right) = \\frac{3T}{\\tau_E}$$\nMultiply both sides by $\\tau_E$:\n$$n\\tau_E \\frac{\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle}{4} \\left( E_{\\alpha} + \\frac{E_{fus}}{Q} \\right) = 3T$$\nTo form the product $nT\\tau_E$, we multiply both sides by $T$ (assuming $T \\neq 0$):\n$$nT\\tau_E \\frac{\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle}{4} \\left( E_{\\alpha} + \\frac{E_{fus}}{Q} \\right) = 3T^2$$\nFinally, we solve for $nT\\tau_E$:\n$$nT\\tau_E = \\frac{12T^2}{\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle \\left( E_{\\alpha} + \\frac{E_{fus}}{Q} \\right)}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the fusion triple product.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe now evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n-   $T = 15\\,\\text{keV}$\n-   $Q = 10$\n-   $\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle = 1.7\\times 10^{-22}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $E_{\\alpha} = 3.5\\,\\text{MeV} = 3.5 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{keV}$\n-   $E_{fus} = 17.6\\,\\text{MeV} = 17.6 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{keV}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$12T^2 = 12 \\times (15\\,\\text{keV})^2 = 12 \\times 225\\,(\\text{keV})^2 = 2700\\,(\\text{keV})^2 = 2.7 \\times 10^3\\,(\\text{keV})^2$$\n\nNext, calculate the term in the parentheses in the denominator:\n$$E_{\\alpha} + \\frac{E_{fus}}{Q} = (3.5 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{keV}) + \\frac{17.6 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{keV}}{10}$$\n$$= (3.5 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{keV}) + (1.76 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{keV}) = 5.26 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{keV}$$\n\nNow, calculate the entire denominator:\n$$\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle \\left( E_{\\alpha} + \\frac{E_{fus}}{Q} \\right) = (1.7 \\times 10^{-22}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (5.26 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{keV})$$\n$$= (1.7 \\times 5.26) \\times 10^{-22+3}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\\,\\text{keV}$$\n$$= 8.942 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\\,\\text{keV}$$\n\nFinally, compute the triple product:\n$$nT\\tau_E = \\frac{2.7 \\times 10^3\\,(\\text{keV})^2}{8.942 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\\,\\text{keV}}$$\n$$nT\\tau_E = \\left(\\frac{2.7}{8.942}\\right) \\times 10^{3 - (-19)}\\,\\text{keV}\\cdot\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}$$\n$$nT\\tau_E \\approx 0.30217 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\text{keV}\\cdot\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3} = 3.0217 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\text{keV}\\cdot\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$nT\\tau_E \\approx 3.02 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\text{keV}\\cdot\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}$$",

Since $T$ is fixed, the scaling of the ratio $p_{\\text{brem}}/p_{\\text{fus}}$ can be written as:\n$$R(f) \\equiv \\frac{p_{\\text{brem}}}{p_{\\text{fus}}} \\propto \\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}}(f) n_e(f)^2}{n_{\\text{D}}(f) n_{\\text{T}}(f)}$$\nThe factor $F(f)$ is the ratio of this quantity evaluated at a general fraction $f$ to its value at $f=0$:\n$$F(f) = \\frac{R(f)}{R(0)} = \\frac{Z_{\\text{eff}}(f) n_e(f)^2 / (n_{\\text{D}}(f) n_{\\text{T}}(f))}{Z_{\\text{eff}}(0) n_e(0)^2 / (n_{\\text{D}}(0) n_{\\text{T}}(0))}$$\n\nWe need to evaluate the components for the ash-free case, $f=0$:\n- $n_{\\text{D}}(0) = n_{\\text{T}}(0) = n/2$, so $n_{\\text{D}}(0)n_{\\text{T}}(0) = n^2/4$.\n- $n_e(0) = n(1+0) = n$.\n- $Z_{\\text{eff}}(0) = \\frac{1+3(0)}{1+0} = 1$.\n\nNow we can assemble the expression for $F(f)$:\n$$F(f) = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1+3f}{1+f} \\right) \\cdot (n(1+f))^2 \\big/ \\left( \\frac{n^2(1-f)^2}{4} \\right)}{ (1) \\cdot n^2 \\big/ \\left( \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right) }$$\nLet's simplify the numerator and denominator of this complex fraction separately.\nThe numerator expression is:\n$$ \\frac{\\left( \\frac{1+3f}{1+f} \\right) n^2 (1+f)^2}{\\frac{n^2(1-f)^2}{4}} = \\frac{4 n^2 (1+3f)(1+f)}{n^2(1-f)^2} = \\frac{4(1+3f)(1+f)}{(1-f)^2} $$\nThe denominator expression is:\n$$ \\frac{1 \\cdot n^2}{n^2/4} = 4 $$\nDividing the numerator by the denominator gives the final expression for $F(f)$:\n$$F(f) = \\frac{\\frac{4(1+3f)(1+f)}{(1-f)^2}}{4} = \\frac{(1+3f)(1+f)}{(1-f)^2}$$\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this expression for an ash fraction of $f=0.05$:\n$$F(0.05) = \\frac{(1+3(0.05))(1+0.05)}{(1-0.05)^2}$$\n$$F(0.05) = \\frac{(1+0.15)(1.05)}{(0.95)^2}$$\n$$F(0.05) = \\frac{(1.15)(1.05)}{0.9025}$$\n$$F(0.05) = \\frac{1.2075}{0.9025} \\approx 1.337949...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.338$. This means that a $5\\%$ helium ash fraction increases the ratio of bremsstrahlung losses to fusion power by approximately $33.8\\%$ compared to a pure D-T plasma with the same total ion density and temperature.",
