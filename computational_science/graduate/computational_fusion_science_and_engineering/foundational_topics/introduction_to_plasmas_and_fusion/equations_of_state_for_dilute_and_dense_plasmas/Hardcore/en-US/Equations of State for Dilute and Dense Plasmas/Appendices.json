Express the final pressure in Pascals, and express the fraction as a pure number (decimal or fraction) with no percentage sign. Round your answers to $4$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. All conditions and data provided are self-consistent and realistic for a laboratory plasma.\n\nThe derivation begins from the kinetic theory of gases. For a single species of particles (e.g., electrons or ions) treated as an ideal monatomic gas, the pressure $P$ exerted on the walls of a container is given by the average rate of momentum transfer per unit area. This leads to the expression:\n$$P = \\frac{1}{3} n m \\langle v^2 \\rangle$$\nwhere $n$ is the number density of the particles, $m$ is the mass of a single particle, and $\\langle v^2 \\rangle$ is the mean-squared speed of the particles.\n\nThe problem states that each species has a Maxwellian velocity distribution at a kinetic temperature $T$. For a Maxwellian gas in three dimensions, the equipartition theorem states that the average kinetic energy per particle is related to the temperature by:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} m \\langle v^2 \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. From this, we can express the mean-squared speed as:\n$$m \\langle v^2 \\rangle = 3 k_B T$$\n\nSubstituting this result back into the kinetic expression for pressure, we obtain the ideal gas law for a single species:\n$$P = \\frac{1}{3} n (3 k_B T) = n k_B T$$\n\nThe problem describes a dilute, weakly coupled plasma, which is a mixture of two species: electrons (subscript $e$) and ions (subscript $i$). In such a mixture, the interactions between particles are negligible for determining the equation of state. Therefore, according to Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, the total pressure $P_{total}$ is the sum of the partial pressures of the constituent species.\n$$P_{total} = P_e + P_i$$\nEach species is treated as an ideal gas, so their partial pressures are given by:\n$$P_e = n_e k_B T_e$$\n$$P_i = n_i k_B T_i$$\nwhere $n_e$ and $T_e$ are the electron number density and temperature, and $n_i$ and $T_i$ are the ion number density and temperature.\n\nThe problem specifies a common kinetic temperature for both species, so $T_e = T_i = T$. The total pressure is thus:\n$$P_{total} = n_e k_B T + n_i k_B T = (n_e + n_i) k_B T$$\nThis is the general expression for the total pressure of a two-species ideal plasma in thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\nElectron number density: $n_e = 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\nIon number density: $n_i = 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\nKinetic temperature: $T = 10\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nNote that in plasma physics, temperature is often given in units of electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), which represents the thermal energy $k_B T$. We use the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$. Thus, the thermal energy is:\n$$k_B T = 10\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 10 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}) = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the total pressure.\n$$P_{total} = (n_e + n_i) k_B T$$\n$$P_{total} = (10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} + 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J})$$\n$$P_{total} = (2 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J})$$\n$$P_{total} = 3.204353268 \\times 10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{J/m^3}$$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{J/m^3} = 1\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, the total pressure is:\n$$P_{total} = 32.04353268\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$P_{total} \\approx 32.04\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\n\nNext, we determine the fraction of the total pressure contributed by the electrons. This fraction, $f_e$, is given by the ratio of the electron partial pressure to the total pressure:\n$$f_e = \\frac{P_e}{P_{total}} = \\frac{n_e k_B T}{(n_e + n_i) k_B T}$$\nThe term $k_B T$ cancels, leaving:\n$$f_e = \\frac{n_e}{n_e + n_i}$$\nUsing the given number densities, $n_e = n_i = 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$:\n$$f_e = \\frac{10^{19}}{10^{19} + 10^{19}} = \\frac{10^{19}}{2 \\times 10^{19}} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $0.5$. The problem requests the answer rounded to $4$ significant figures, which gives:\n$$f_e = 0.5000$$\nThis result is independent of temperature and depends only on the relative number densities. Since the number densities of electrons and ions are equal in a fully ionized hydrogen plasma, they contribute equally to the total pressure.",

            "introduction": "As plasma density increases, the ideal gas model is no longer sufficient, and electrostatic interactions become dominant.

The OCP model treats ions as a single species of point charges interacting via the Coulomb potential, immersed in a rigid, uniform, neutralizing background of opposite charge (the electrons). The validity of this model rests on two physical criteria:\n1. The ions must be strongly coupled, meaning that their potential energy of interaction significantly exceeds their kinetic energy. This condition is met when the ion coupling parameter $\\Gamma$ is much greater than $1$. In our case, $\\Gamma \\approx 180 \\gg 1$, so the ions are indeed very strongly coupled. They are expected to be in a liquid or solid-like state.\n\n2. The electrons must form a nearly ideal, uniform background. This occurs when the electrons are highly quantum degenerate. Electron degeneracy is measured by the ratio of the thermal energy $k_B T$ to the electron Fermi energy $E_F$. The degeneracy parameter is $\\Theta_e = k_B T / E_F$. The OCP model is applicable if $\\Theta_e \\ll 1$.\n\nTo check this condition, we first calculate the electron number density $n_e$ from the charge neutrality condition: $n_e = Z n_i$.\n$$\nn_e = 6 \\times (10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) = 6 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nThe Fermi energy $E_F$ for a non-relativistic electron gas is given by:\n$$\nE_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_e}(3\\pi^2 n_e)^{2/3}\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant and $m_e$ is the electron mass.\n$$\nE_F = \\frac{(1.05457 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot s})^2}{2(9.10938 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg})} (3\\pi^2 (6 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}))^{2/3}\n$$\n$$\nE_F \\approx (6.1042 \\times 10^{-39}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot m^2}) \\times (1.7765 \\times 10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})^{2/3}\n$$\n$$\nE_F \\approx (6.1042 \\times 10^{-39}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot m^2}) \\times (1.4682 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}) \\approx 8.962 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nThe thermal energy is $k_B T = 1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$.

Their Fermi energy greatly exceeds the thermal energy, causing them to behave as a nearly ideal, high-pressure quantum gas which forms a smooth, neutralizing background for the ions.\n\nBoth criteria ($\\Gamma \\gg 1$ and $\\Theta_e \\ll 1$) are well satisfied. Therefore, the One-Component Plasma model is an excellent approximation for describing the ionic equation of state for this plasma.",
