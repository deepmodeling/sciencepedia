The quantities $E$ and $L$ are defined by the asymptotic conditions and are consistent with $v$ and $b$. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full derivation will be provided.\n\nWe begin the derivation in the center-of-mass (CM) frame, where the two-body problem reduces to a one-body problem of a particle with reduced mass $\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$ moving in a central potential $V(r) = \\frac{k}{r}$, where we define the constant $k = \\frac{q_1 q_2}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0}$ for notational convenience. The particle's position is described by polar coordinates $(r, \\phi)$.\n\nThe motion is governed by the conservation of total energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$. These are determined by the initial conditions at $r \\to \\infty$, where the potential $V(r) \\to 0$ and the relative speed is $v$.\nThe total energy is purely kinetic at infinity:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v^2$$\nThe angular momentum is constant throughout the interaction. At infinity, the trajectory is a straight line with speed $v$ at a perpendicular distance $b$ (the impact parameter) from the origin. Thus, the angular momentum has magnitude:\n$$L = \\mu v b$$\nThe conservation of energy for any point along the trajectory is expressed as:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\left(\\dot{r}^2 + r^2 \\dot{\\phi}^2\\right) + V(r)$$\nwhere $\\dot{r} = \\frac{dr}{dt}$ and $\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{d\\phi}{dt}$.\nFrom the conservation of angular momentum, $L = \\mu r^2 \\dot{\\phi}$, we can write $\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{L}{\\mu r^2}$. Substituting this into the energy equation gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}\\mu v^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu \\dot{r}^2 + \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2} + \\frac{k}{r}$$\nWe can solve for $\\dot{r}$:\n$$\\dot{r} = \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\mu}\\left(E - \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2} - \\frac{k}{r}\\right)}$$\nTo find the trajectory $r(\\phi)$, we compute the derivative $\\frac{dr}{d\\phi}$:\n$$\\frac{dr}{d\\phi} = \\frac{dr/dt}{d\\phi/dt} = \\frac{\\dot{r}}{\\dot{\\phi}} = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\mu}\\left(E - \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2} - \\frac{k}{r}\\right)}}{L/(\\mu r^2)}$$\nIt is more convenient to find $\\frac{d\\phi}{dr}$ and integrate. Let's find the angle swept as the particle moves from its point of closest approach, $r_{min}$, to infinity. At $r_{min}$, the radial velocity $\\dot{r}=0$. From the energy equation, this gives:\n$$E = \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r_{min}^2} + \\frac{k}{r_{min}}$$\nThe change in angle from $r_{min}$ to $\\infty$ is given by the integral:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\int_{r_{min}}^{\\infty} \\frac{d\\phi}{dr} dr = \\int_{r_{min}}^{\\infty} \\frac{L/(\\mu r^2)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\mu}\\left(E - \\frac{L^2}{2\\mu r^2} - \\frac{k}{r}\\right)}} dr$$\nSubstituting $E = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v^2$ and $L = \\mu v b$:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\int_{r_{min}}^{\\infty} \\frac{b}{r^2 \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{b^2}{r^2} - \\frac{2k}{\\mu v^2 r}}} dr$$\nTo solve this integral, we make the substitution $u = \\frac{1}{r}$, so $du = -\\frac{1}{r^2} dr$. The limits of integration change from $(r_{min}, \\infty)$ to $(u_{max}, 0)$, where $u_{max} = \\frac{1}{r_{min}}$.\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\int_{u_{max}}^{0} \\frac{b(-du)}{\\sqrt{1 - b^2 u^2 - \\frac{2k}{\\mu v^2} u}} = \\int_{0}^{u_{max}} \\frac{b \\, du}{\\sqrt{1 - b^2 u^2 - \\frac{2k}{\\mu v^2} u}}$$\nThe upper limit $u_{max}$ is the value of $u$ for which the expression under the square root is zero, corresponding to $\\dot{r}=0$. We complete the square for the quadratic in $u$ under the radical:\n$$1 - \\left(b^2 u^2 + \\frac{2k}{\\mu v^2}u \\right) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}\\right)^2 - \\left(b u + \\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}\\right)^2$$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\int_{0}^{u_{max}} \\frac{b \\, du}{\\sqrt{\\left(1 + \\left(\\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}\\right)^2\\right) - \\left(b u + \\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}\\right)^2}}$$\nThis is a standard integral of the form $\\int \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}$, which evaluates to $\\arcsin(x/a)$.\nLet $z = b u + \\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}$. Then $dz = b \\, du$. The integral is:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\left[ \\arcsin\\left( \\frac{b u + \\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}\\right)^2}} \\right) \\right]_{u=0}^{u=u_{max}}$$\nAt the upper limit $u=u_{max}$, the term under the original square root is zero, which means the completed square is zero. The argument of the $\\arcsin$ function is $1$, so its value is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. At the lower limit $u=0$:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arcsin\\left( \\frac{k/(\\mu v^2 b)}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}\\right)^2}} \\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\arcsin(x) + \\arccos(x) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have:\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\arccos\\left( \\frac{k/(\\mu v^2 b)}{\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}\\right)^2}} \\right)$$\nThe trajectory is symmetric about the point of closest approach. The total angle swept by the radius vector from the incoming asymptote to the outgoing asymptote is $\\Phi = 2\\Delta\\phi$.\nThe scattering angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the initial and final directions of motion.\nFor a repulsive force ($k > 0$), the particle is deflected away. The geometry implies $\\theta = \\pi - \\Phi = \\pi - 2\\Delta\\phi$.\nFor an attractive force ($k  0$), the particle is pulled towards the center. The geometry implies $\\theta = \\Phi - \\pi = 2\\Delta\\phi - \\pi$.\nLet's consider both cases. Let $\\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\mu v^2 b}$. We can write $\\Delta\\phi = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{1+\\alpha^2}}\\right)$.\nA trigonometric identity states that if $\\tan(\\psi) = \\alpha$, then $\\cos(\\psi) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\alpha^2}}$ and $\\sin(\\psi) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{1+\\alpha^2}}$. Thus, $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{1+\\alpha^2}} = \\sin(\\psi)$.\nSo, $\\Delta\\phi = \\arccos(\\sin(\\psi)) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\psi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan(\\alpha)$.\nFor a repulsive force ($k>0$, so $\\alpha>0$):\n$$\\theta = \\pi - 2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan(\\alpha)\\right) = 2\\arctan(\\alpha)$$\nFor an attractive force ($k0$, so $\\alpha0$):\n$$\\theta = 2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan(\\alpha)\\right) - \\pi = -2\\arctan(\\alpha) = 2\\arctan(-\\alpha)$$\nIn both cases, since the physical scattering angle $\\theta$ is defined as a positive quantity in the range $[0, \\pi]$, the expression is $\\theta = 2\\arctan(|\\alpha|)$.\nSubstituting back for $\\alpha$ and $k$:\n$$\\theta = 2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{|k|}{\\mu v^2 b}\\right) = 2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\mu v^2 b}\\right)$$\nThis is the derived expression for the exact scattering angle.\n\nNow, we perform the subsequent tasks as requested.\nFirst, we define the impact parameter $b_{90}$ that yields a scattering angle of $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{2} = 2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\mu v^2 b_{90}}\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\mu v^2 b_{90}}\\right)$$\nApplying the tangent function to both sides:\n$$\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 1 = \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\mu v^2 b_{90}}$$\nSolving for $b_{90}$:\n$$b_{90} = \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\mu v^2}$$\nSecond, we verify the small-angle limit for $b \\gg b_{90}$. This condition implies that the argument of the arctan function is small. Let $x = \\frac{|q_1 q_2|}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\mu v^2 b}$. Using the definition of $b_{90}$, we can write $x = \\frac{b_{90}}{b}$.\nThe condition $b \\gg b_{90}$ means $x \\ll 1$.\nThe exact scattering angle is $\\theta = 2\\arctan(x)$.\nFor small values of $x$, the Taylor series expansion of $\\arctan(x)$ is $\\arctan(x) \\approx x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\dots$.\nTo first order, for $x \\ll 1$, we have $\\arctan(x) \\approx x$.\nTherefore, the scattering angle in this limit is:\n$$\\theta \\approx 2x = 2\\frac{b_{90}}{b}$$\nThis completes the verification of the small-angle approximation through a controlled expansion of the exact result. The final symbolic expression for the scattering angle is the one derived initially.",

In modeling small-angle Coulomb collisions for electron-electron interactions in a computational Fokker–Planck or Monte Carlo collision operator, the upper impact-parameter cutoff $b_{\\max}$ is controlled by electrostatic screening and by the finite system size, while the lower cutoff $b_{\\min}$ is controlled by the breakdown of classical scattering and by quantum diffraction. \n\nUsing only first principles and core definitions, do the following:\n- Derive the Debye screening length $\\lambda_D$ from linearized electrostatics and thermodynamics, compute its numerical value for the parameters given below, and decide whether the appropriate upper cutoff $b_{\\max}$ should be set by $\\lambda_D$ or by the system size $L$.\n- From conservation of energy and wave–particle duality, obtain expressions for the classical distance of closest approach and the electron de Broglie wavelength evaluated at the electron thermal speed.

We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln \\Lambda$, for electron-electron collisions in a deuterium plasma. This logarithm is defined as $\\ln \\Lambda = \\ln(b_{\\max}/b_{\\min})$, where $b_{\\max}$ and $b_{\\min}$ are the maximum and minimum impact parameters for small-angle scattering theory. We will determine these cutoffs in three steps as requested.\n\nFirst, we determine the upper impact-parameter cutoff, $b_{\\max}$. This cutoff arises from either the collective screening of the Coulomb potential by the plasma or the finite size of the confining system. We begin by deriving the Debye screening length, $\\lambda_D$.\n\nConsider a test charge $+Q$ placed in a homogeneous, quasi-neutral plasma. The electrostatic potential $\\phi$ is described by Poisson's equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho_{\\text{total}}}{\\epsilon_0} $$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\text{total}}$ is the total charge density and $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity. The total charge density is the sum of the test charge density and the plasma charge density, $\\rho_{\\text{total}} = Q\\delta(\\vec{r}) + \\rho_{\\text{plasma}}$. The plasma consists of electrons and ions (deuterons, with charge $+e$). In the absence of the test charge, the plasma is neutral, so the unperturbed electron and ion densities are equal, $n_{e0} = n_{i0}$. Due to their large mass, we assume the ions form a fixed, uniform neutralizing background. The electrons, being mobile, respond to the potential $\\phi$. Assuming the electrons are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T_e$, their density follows the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$ n_e(\\vec{r}) = n_{e0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi(\\vec{r})}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nThe plasma charge density is $\\rho_{\\text{plasma}}(\\vec{r}) = e(n_{i0} - n_e(\\vec{r})) = e n_{e0} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right)\\right)$. For weak potentials, $|e\\phi| \\ll k_B T_e$, we can linearize the exponential: $\\exp(x) \\approx 1+x$.

This is set by the breakdown of the classical, small-angle approximation. Two scales are relevant: the classical distance of closest approach and the quantum mechanical de Broglie wavelength.\nThe classical distance of closest approach, $b_c$, for a head-on collision between two electrons is the distance at which their characteristic kinetic energy equals their electrostatic potential energy. For a typical collision, the kinetic energy in the center-of-mass frame is of the order of the thermal energy, $T_e$.

A light particle of mass $m$, charge $e$, and initial velocity $v$ scatters off a heavy, stationary ion of charge $Ze$. The Coulomb force is given by\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Ze^2}{r^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the distance between the particles and $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ is the unit vector pointing from the ion to the light particle.\nIn the small-angle scattering approximation, we assume the particle's trajectory is nearly a straight line. Let the particle travel along the $x$-axis with impact parameter $b$ along the $y$-axis. The particle's position is approximately $(x(t), y(t)) \\approx (vt, b)$. The distance to the scattering center is $r = \\sqrt{(vt)^2 + b^2}$.\n\nThe change in momentum perpendicular to the initial direction of motion, $\\Delta p_\\perp$, is the time integral of the perpendicular component of the force, $F_\\perp$.\n$$\nF_\\perp = |\\mathbf{F}| \\cos\\phi = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\frac{Ze^2}{r^2} \\frac{b}{r} = \\frac{Ze^2 b}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 ( (vt)^2 + b^2 )^{3/2}}\n$$\nThe total impulse in the perpendicular direction is\n$$\n\\Delta p_\\perp = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} F_\\perp dt = \\frac{Ze^2 b}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{dt}{( (vt)^2 + b^2 )^{3/2}}\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we make the substitution $t = \\frac{b}{v}\\tan\\psi$, which implies $dt = \\frac{b}{v}\\sec^2\\psi \\,d\\psi$. The limits of integration change from $t \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$ to $\\psi \\in (-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$.\n$$\n\\Delta p_\\perp = \\frac{Ze^2 b}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\frac{b}{v}\\sec^2\\psi \\,d\\psi}{(b^2\\tan^2\\psi + b^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{Ze^2 b^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 v} \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\sec^2\\psi}{(b^2\\sec^2\\psi)^{3/2}} \\,d\\psi\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_\\perp = \\frac{Ze^2 b^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 v b^3} \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\frac{\\sec^2\\psi}{\\sec^3\\psi} \\,d\\psi = \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 v b} \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\cos\\psi \\,d\\psi\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_\\perp = \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 v b} [\\sin\\psi]_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} = \\frac{Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 v b} (1 - (-1)) = \\frac{2Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 v b}\n$$\nFor small angles, the deflection angle $\\theta$ is given by $\\theta \\approx \\tan\\theta = \\frac{\\Delta p_\\perp}{p_\\parallel}$, where $p_\\parallel \\approx mv$ is the initial momentum.\n$$\n\\theta(b) = \\frac{\\Delta p_\\perp}{mv} = \\frac{2Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m v^2 b}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the mean-square scattering rate. The rate of collisions for a single projectile with target ions having impact parameters between $b$ and $b+db$ is the number of targets in a cylindrical shell of radius $b$, thickness $db$, and length $v$ (traversed in $1$ second). This rate is $n v (2\\pi b db)$. Since each collision is independent, the mean-square scattering angle accumulates. The total mean-square scattering angle per unit time, which we can identify as a characteristic collision frequency $\\nu$, is found by integrating over all relevant impact parameters from $b_{\\min}$ to $b_{\\max}$.\n$$\n\\nu \\equiv \\frac{d\\langle\\theta^2\\rangle}{dt} = \\int_{b_{\\min}}^{b_{\\max}} \\theta(b)^2 (n v \\, 2\\pi b \\, db)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\theta(b)$:\n$$\n\\nu = \\int_{b_{\\min}}^{b_{\\max}} \\left(\\frac{2Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m v^2 b}\\right)^2 (2\\pi n v) b \\, db\n$$\n$$\n\\nu = 2\\pi n v \\left(\\frac{2Ze^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 m v^2}\\right)^2 \\int_{b_{\\min}}^{b_{\\max}} \\frac{1}{b^2} b \\, db = 2\\pi n v \\left(\\frac{Ze^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 m v^2}\\right)^2 \\int_{b_{\\min}}^{b_{\\max}} \\frac{1}{b} \\, db\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to $\\ln(b_{\\max}) - \\ln(b_{\\min}) = \\ln(b_{\\max}/b_{\\min})$. By definition, this is the Coulomb logarithm, $\\ln\\Lambda$.\n$$\n\\nu = 2\\pi n v \\left(\\frac{Ze^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 m v^2}\\right)^2 \\ln\\Lambda\n$$\nThis establishes the proportionality of the collision frequency $\\nu$ to the Coulomb logarithm $\\ln\\Lambda$. We can write this as $\\nu = C \\ln\\Lambda$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on plasma parameters but not on the cutoff parameters $b_{\\min}$ and $b_{\\max}$.\n$$\nC = 2\\pi n v \\left(\\frac{Ze^2}{2\\pi\\epsilon_0 m v^2}\\right)^2\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the logarithmic sensitivity of $\\nu$ to uncertainties in the cutoffs, which are encapsulated in $\\Lambda$. We need to compute the quantity $\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\nu}{\\partial \\ln \\Lambda}$.\nWe begin with the relationship $\\nu = C \\ln\\Lambda$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\nu = \\ln(C \\ln\\Lambda) = \\ln C + \\ln(\\ln\\Lambda)\n$$\nThe constant $C$ is independent of $\\Lambda$ (and thus of $\\ln\\Lambda$), so its logarithm $\\ln C$ is also a constant with respect to $\\Lambda$. We now differentiate this expression with respect to $\\ln\\Lambda$. Let the variable of differentiation be $X = \\ln\\Lambda$. Our expression is $\\ln\\nu = \\ln C + \\ln(X)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\nu}{\\partial \\ln \\Lambda} = \\frac{d}{d(\\ln\\Lambda)} \\left[ \\ln C + \\ln(\\ln\\Lambda) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\nu}{\\partial \\ln \\Lambda} = \\frac{d(\\ln C)}{d(\\ln\\Lambda)} + \\frac{d(\\ln(\\ln\\Lambda))}{d(\\ln\\Lambda)}\n$$\nThe first term is zero because $\\ln C$ is a constant. For the second term, we use the derivative of the natural logarithm, $\\frac{d(\\ln x)}{dx} = \\frac{1}{x}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\ln \\nu}{\\partial \\ln \\Lambda} = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\ln\\Lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\ln\\Lambda}\n$$\nThe result is not a function of the specific forms of $b_{\\min}$ or $b_{\\max}$, nor of any other plasma parameters, but only of the Coulomb logarithm itself.",
