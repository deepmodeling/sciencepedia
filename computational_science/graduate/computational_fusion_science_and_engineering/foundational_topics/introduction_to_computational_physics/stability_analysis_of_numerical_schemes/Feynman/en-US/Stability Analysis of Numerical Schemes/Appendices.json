It is a standard problem in the stability analysis of numerical methods for partial differential equations.\n\nThe task is to perform a von Neumann stability analysis on the Lax–Friedrichs scheme for the linear advection equation. The scheme is given as:\n$$\nu_{j}^{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(u_{j+1}^{n} + u_{j-1}^{n}\\right) - \\frac{\\nu}{2}\\left(u_{j+1}^{n} - u_{j-1}^{n}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\nu = \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ is the Courant number.\n\nThe von Neumann analysis proceeds by substituting a single Fourier mode into the difference equation. A general solution can be represented as a superposition of such modes. If every mode decays or remains bounded in time, the numerical scheme is stable. We consider a single Fourier mode of the form:\n$$\nu_{j}^{n} = \\hat{u}^{n} \\exp(i \\theta j)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{u}^{n}$ is the amplitude of the mode at time step $n$, $j$ is the spatial grid index, and $\\theta = k \\Delta x$ is the dimensionless wavenumber, or phase angle, with $k$ being the wavenumber and $\\Delta x$ the grid spacing.\n\nThe amplification factor, $G(\\theta)$, is defined by the relation $\\hat{u}^{n+1} = G(\\theta)\\hat{u}^{n}$.

The LTE is therefore:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} u_{tt} + a \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{6} u_{xxx} + \\dots\n$$\nFrom the original PDE, we can find relations between derivatives. Differentiating $u_t = -a u_x$ with respect to $t$ gives $u_{tt} = -a u_{xt} = -a (u_t)_x = -a(-a u_x)_x = a^2 u_{xx}$. Thus, the leading term of the error is not zero.

Using Euler's formula, $\\sin\\theta = (\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\theta) - \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\theta))/(2\\mathrm{i})$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nG(\\theta,\\nu) = 1 - \\frac{\\nu}{2} (2\\mathrm{i}\\sin\\theta) = 1 - \\mathrm{i}\\nu\\sin\\theta\n$$\nThis is the complex amplification factor for the FTCS scheme applied to the linear advection equation.\n\nNow, we compute the maximum magnitude of the amplification factor, $\\rho(\\nu) = \\max_{\\theta \\in [-\\pi,\\pi]} |G(\\theta,\\nu)|$. The magnitude of $G(\\theta,\\nu)$ is the magnitude of a complex number $z = x + \\mathrm{i}y$ with $x=1$ and $y=-\\nu\\sin\\theta$.\n$$\n|G(\\theta,\\nu)| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-\\nu\\sin\\theta)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta}\n$$\nTo find the maximum magnitude, we must maximize this expression with respect to $\\theta \\in [-\\pi,\\pi]$. The value of $\\nu^2$ is non-negative. The function $\\sin^2\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $1$. The maximum of $|G(\\theta,\\nu)|$ occurs when $\\sin^2\\theta$ is maximum, i.e., $\\sin^2\\theta = 1$. This occurs for $\\theta = \\pm \\pi/2$.\nTherefore, the maximum magnitude $\\rho(\\nu)$ is:\n$$\n\\rho(\\nu) = \\max_{\\theta \\in [-\\pi,\\pi]} \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta} = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2(1)} = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we use the Lax–Richtmyer Equivalence Theorem to argue for the non-convergence of the scheme. The theorem states that for a linear initial value problem, a consistent finite difference scheme is convergent if and only if it is stable.\nWe have already shown that the FTCS scheme is consistent with the advection equation.\nThe von Neumann condition for stability requires that the magnitude of the amplification factor be less than or equal to $1$ for all possible phase angles $\\theta$, i.e., $|G(\\theta,\\nu)| \\le 1$.\nFrom our analysis, $|G(\\theta,\\nu)| = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta}$. The stability condition becomes:\n$$\n\\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta} \\le 1\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives $1 + \\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta \\le 1$, which simplifies to $\\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta \\le 0$. Since $\\nu^2 \\ge 0$ and $\\sin^2\\theta \\ge 0$, this inequality can only be satisfied if $\\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta = 0$.\nThe problem states $a \\neq 0$, and for any non-trivial discretization, $\\Delta t > 0$ and $\\Delta x > 0$, so the Courant number $\\nu = a\\Delta t/\\Delta x \\neq 0$. Therefore, $\\nu^2 > 0$. The condition $\\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta \\le 0$ can only hold if $\\sin\\theta = 0$, which corresponds to the modes with $\\theta=0, \\pm\\pi$. For any other mode where $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$, we have $\\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta > 0$, and thus $|G(\\theta,\\nu)| = \\sqrt{1 + \\nu^2\\sin^2\\theta} > 1$.\nThe scheme is numerically unstable for any mode with $\\sin\\theta \\neq 0$, regardless of the choice of $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x$ (as long as $\\nu \\neq 0$). Thus, the FTCS scheme is unconditionally unstable for the linear advection equation.\nSince the scheme is consistent but unstable, the Lax–Richtmyer Equivalence Theorem implies that the scheme is not convergent.",

The inequality becomes:\n$$\nC^2 (4S(1-S)) \\le 8dS + 16d^2 S^2\n$$\nFor non-zero wave numbers, $S > 0$, so we can divide by $4S$:\n$$\nC^2 (1-S) \\le 2d + 4d^2 S\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate constants from terms depending on $S$:\n$$\nC^2 - 2d \\le C^2 S + 4d^2 S = (C^2 + 4d^2)S\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all possible spatial modes, which means it must hold for all possible values of $S = \\sin^2(k\\Delta x/2)$. On a discrete grid, the range of wavenumbers corresponds to $S \\in [0, 1]$. Let $f(S) = (C^2 + 4d^2)S - (C^2 - 2d)$. We require $f(S) \\ge 0$ for all $S \\in [0, 1]$.\nThe function $f(S)$ is linear in $S$. The slope, $(C^2 + 4d^2)$, is non-negative. Thus, $f(S)$ is a non-decreasing function of $S$. The minimum value of $f(S)$ on the interval $[0, 1]$ occurs at $S=0$. To ensure $f(S) \\ge 0$ for the entire interval, we must satisfy the condition at its minimum:\n$$\nf(0) \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\n(C^2 + 4d^2)(0) - (C^2 - 2d) \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\n-(C^2 - 2d) \\ge 0\n$$\n$$\n2d - C^2 \\ge 0 \\implies C^2 \\le 2d\n$$\nThis is the general stability condition for the IMEX scheme. Now we substitute the definitions of $C$ and $d$ back into this inequality to find the constraint on the time step $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\right)^2 \\le 2\\left(\\frac{\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{a^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le \\frac{2\\nu \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nAssuming $\\Delta t > 0$ and $a \\ne 0$, we can multiply both sides by $\\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{a^2 \\Delta t}$ to solve for $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2\\nu}{a^2}\n$$\nThis gives the maximum permissible time step for the scheme to be linearly stable for all Fourier modes. This result is notable as it is independent of the spatial grid spacing $\\Delta x$. The unit of the expression is $(\\text{length}^2/\\text{time}) / (\\text{length}/\\text{time})^2 = \\text{time}$, as required. Thus, the largest stable time step, in seconds, is given by this expression.",
