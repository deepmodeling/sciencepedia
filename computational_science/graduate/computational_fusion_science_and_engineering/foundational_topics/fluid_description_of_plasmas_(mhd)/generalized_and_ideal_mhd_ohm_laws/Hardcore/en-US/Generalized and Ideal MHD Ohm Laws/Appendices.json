This practice begins with the comprehensive generalized Ohm's law and guides you through simplifying it to the resistive induction equation, which describes how a magnetic field is both transported by a plasma flow and diffuses due to finite resistivity. By performing a scaling analysis and calculating the ratio of the advective and diffusive timescales—the Lundquist number—you will develop the physical intuition needed to determine when a plasma behaves ideally and when resistive effects are crucial . This is a foundational skill for modeling diverse systems, from laboratory fusion devices to astrophysical phenomena like the solar corona.",

No flaws are identified. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe derivation of the induction equation begins with the two provided laws: Faraday's law and the generalized Ohm's law.\nFaraday's law is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla\\times \\boldsymbol{E}\n$$\nThe generalized Ohm's law is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E}+\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B}=\\eta\\,\\boldsymbol{J}+\\frac{1}{ne}\\,\\boldsymbol{J}\\times \\boldsymbol{B}-\\frac{\\nabla p_{e}}{ne}+\\frac{m_{e}}{ne^{2}}\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{J}}{dt}\n$$\nThe problem states that we should neglect the Hall term ($\\frac{1}{ne}\\,\\boldsymbol{J}\\times \\boldsymbol{B}$), the electron pressure-gradient term ($-\\frac{\\nabla p_{e}}{ne}$), and the electron inertia term ($\\frac{m_{e}}{ne^{2}}\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{J}}{dt}$). Applying these simplifications to the generalized Ohm's law yields the resistive Ohm's law for a collisional plasma:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E}+\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B}=\\eta\\,\\boldsymbol{J}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the electric field $\\boldsymbol{E}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{E} = -\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B} + \\eta\\,\\boldsymbol{J}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\boldsymbol{E}$ into Faraday's law gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla\\times(-\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B} + \\eta\\,\\boldsymbol{J}) = \\nabla\\times(\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B}) - \\nabla\\times(\\eta\\,\\boldsymbol{J})\n$$\nThe problem also states to neglect the displacement current, which implies we can use the magnetostatic form of Ampere's law:\n$$\n\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{B} = \\mu_{0}\\boldsymbol{J}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{0}$ is the magnetic permeability of free space. We can write the current density $\\boldsymbol{J}$ in terms of the magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}}\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{B}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the evolving induction equation, and noting that the electrical resistivity $\\eta$ is assumed to be spatially uniform, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\times(\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B}) - \\nabla\\times\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{B}\\right) = \\nabla\\times(\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B}) - \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}\\nabla\\times(\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{B})\n$$\nThe first term on the right-hand side, $\\nabla\\times(\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B})$, is the advective term, which describes the transport of the magnetic field with the plasma fluid motion. The second term, $-\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}\\nabla\\times(\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{B})$, is the diffusive term. We use the vector identity $\\nabla\\times(\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{A}) - \\nabla^{2}\\boldsymbol{A}$. In magnetohydrodynamics, the magnetic field is always divergence-free, i.e., $\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{B}=0$. Applying this, the diffusive term simplifies:\n$$\n\\nabla\\times(\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{B}) = \\nabla(\\nabla\\cdot\\boldsymbol{B}) - \\nabla^{2}\\boldsymbol{B} = -\\nabla^{2}\\boldsymbol{B}\n$$\nThus, the final form of the induction equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla\\times(\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B}) + \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}\\nabla^{2}\\boldsymbol{B}\n$$\nThis equation contains an advective term, $\\nabla\\times(\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B})$, and a diffusive term, $\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}\\nabla^{2}\\boldsymbol{B}$.\n\nThe magnetic diffusivity, denoted as $\\eta_{m}$, is the coefficient of the diffusive term. By inspection, we have:\n$$\n\\eta_{m} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}\n$$\nThe electrical resistivity $\\eta$ is the reciprocal of the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$, so $\\eta = 1/\\sigma$. Therefore, the magnetic diffusivity can be expressed in terms of $\\sigma$ as:\n$$\n\\eta_{m} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}\\sigma}\n$$\nNext, we define the characteristic timescales. The magnetic field diffusion timescale, $\\tau_{\\eta}$, is found by balancing the time-derivative term with the diffusion term in the induction equation. Using scaling analysis, where operators are replaced by characteristic scales ($\\partial/\\partial t \\sim 1/\\tau_{\\eta}$, $\\nabla \\sim 1/L$, and we denote the characteristic field strength by $B$):\n$$\n\\frac{B}{\\tau_{\\eta}} \\sim \\eta_{m} \\frac{B}{L^{2}} \\implies \\tau_{\\eta} = \\frac{L^{2}}{\\eta_{m}} = L^{2}\\mu_{0}\\sigma\n$$\nThe characteristic advection time, $\\tau_{A}$, is found by balancing the time-derivative term with the advection term.

This means that $\\tau_{\\eta} \\gg \\tau_{A}$. The timescale for magnetic diffusion is vastly longer than the timescale for hydromagnetic motions (advection). Consequently, on the scales of interest ($L$ and $\\tau_{A}$), the effects of Ohmic diffusion are negligible.

This dominance implies that the magnetic field is \"frozen-in\" to the plasma, meaning the magnetic field lines are transported along with the bulk plasma flow. Therefore, the ideal MHD limit of the generalized Ohm's law, which corresponds to setting the right-hand side to zero ($\\boldsymbol{E}+\\boldsymbol{v}\\times \\boldsymbol{B} = 0$), is an excellent approximation for describing the plasma dynamics at the given scale in a solar-coronal current sheet.",

There are no identifiable flaws. A solution will be generated.\n\n### Derivation of Relative Helicity between Flux Tubes\n\nThe total magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is the superposition of the fields from the two disjoint flux tubes, $\\boldsymbol{B} = \\boldsymbol{B}_1 + \\boldsymbol{B}_2$. The corresponding total vector potential is $\\boldsymbol{A} = \\boldsymbol{A}_1 + \\boldsymbol{A}_2$, where $\\boldsymbol{B}_i = \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}_i$. The magnetic helicity within the volume $V$ is defined as $H = \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B} \\, dV$. In the context of a perfectly conducting boundary where $\\boldsymbol{B} \\cdot \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}} = 0$, this definition is gauge-invariant.\n\nSubstituting the composed fields and potentials, the total helicity becomes:\n$$\nH = \\int_V (\\boldsymbol{A}_1 + \\boldsymbol{A}_2) \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{B}_1 + \\boldsymbol{B}_2) \\, dV\n$$\n$$\nH = \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_1 \\, dV + \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_2 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2 \\, dV + \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2 \\, dV + \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_2 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_1 \\, dV\n$$\nThe first two terms, $H_{11} = \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_1 \\, dV$ and $H_{22} = \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_2 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2 \\, dV$, are the self-helicities of tube $1$ and tube $2$, respectively. These terms depend on the internal twist and writhe (coiling) of each tube.\n\nThe last two terms constitute the mutual helicity, $H_{12}$, which quantifies the helicity arising from the linkage of the two flux tubes:\n$$\nH_{12} = \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2 \\, dV + \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_2 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_1 \\, dV\n$$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\times \\boldsymbol{A}_2) = \\boldsymbol{A}_2 \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}_1) - \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}_2) = \\boldsymbol{A}_2 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_1 - \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2$, we can relate the two integrals. Integrating over the volume $V$ and applying the divergence theorem gives $\\oint_{\\partial V} (\\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\times \\boldsymbol{A}_2) \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{S} = \\int_V (\\boldsymbol{A}_2 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_1 - \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2) \\, dV$. For a perfectly conducting boundary, a gauge can be chosen such that the surface integral vanishes. This implies $\\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_2 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_1 \\, dV = \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2 \\, dV$. Thus, the mutual helicity simplifies to:\n$$\nH_{12} = 2 \\int_V \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2 \\, dV\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we employ the thin-flux-tube approximation. The field $\\boldsymbol{B}_2$ is non-zero only within the volume of tube $2$, denoted $V_2$. So the integration domain reduces to $V_2$.\n$$\nH_{12} = 2 \\int_{V_2} \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2 \\, dV\n$$\nWithin tube $2$, the magnetic field is uniform and directed along its axis curve $C_2$. Let $d\\boldsymbol{l}_2$ be the line element along $C_2$. An infinitesimal volume element is $dV = da_2 \\, dl_2$, where $da_2$ is the cross-sectional area element.\n$$\nH_{12} = 2 \\int_{C_2} \\left( \\int_{S_2(l_2)} \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2 \\, da_2 \\right) dl_2\n$$\nwhere $S_2(l_2)$ is the cross-section of the tube at a given position along $C_2$. Since tube $2$ is thin, we can assume $\\boldsymbol{A}_1$ is approximately constant across its cross-section. Also, $\\boldsymbol{B}_2$ is uniform across the cross-section. This allows us to write:\n$$\nH_{12} \\approx 2 \\int_{C_2} (\\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{B}_2) S_2 \\, dl_2 = 2 \\int_{C_2} \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{B}_2 S_2) \\, d\\boldsymbol{l}_2\n$$\nHere, we've used $d\\boldsymbol{l}_2$ to represent the direction of $\\boldsymbol{B}_2$. The magnetic flux of tube $2$ is $\\Phi_2 = B_2 S_2$, which is constant along the tube. Therefore:\n$$\nH_{12} = 2\\Phi_2 \\oint_{C_2} \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{l}_2\n$$\nBy Stokes' theorem, the line integral of the vector potential $\\boldsymbol{A}_1$ around the closed curve $C_2$ is equal to the magnetic flux of $\\boldsymbol{B}_1 = \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}_1$ through any surface $S_{C_2}$ bounded by $C_2$:\n$$\n\\oint_{C_2} \\boldsymbol{A}_1 \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{l}_2 = \\int_{S_{C_2}} (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{A}_1) \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{S} = \\int_{S_{C_2}} \\boldsymbol{B}_1 \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{S}\n$$\nThis integral represents the total magnetic flux from tube $1$ that passes through the loop $C_2$. This is precisely what the Gauss linking number $L$ quantifies. The total flux of $\\boldsymbol{B}_1$ through $C_2$ is the flux per strand, $\\Phi_1$, multiplied by the signed number of times tube $1$ pierces the surface $S_{C_2}$, which is the linking number $L$.\n$$\n\\int_{S_{C_2}} \\boldsymbol{B}_1 \\cdot d\\boldsymbol{S} = L \\Phi_1\n$$\nSubstituting this result back gives the expression for the mutual helicity:\n$$\nH_{12} = 2 \\Phi_2 (L \\Phi_1) = 2 L \\Phi_1 \\Phi_2\n$$\nThe problem asks for the \"relative helicity between the two tubes\". This is interpreted as the portion of the total relative helicity of the system that arises purely from the mutual linkage. The reference field $\\boldsymbol{B}_0$ is specified as having no mutual linkage, so its mutual helicity is zero. The self-helicity terms are assumed to be handled by the reference field definition (\"negligible twist relative to a chosen reference configuration\"). Therefore, the quantity of interest is the mutual helicity $H_{12}$.\n\n### Preservation of Mutual Linking Number\n\nThe preservation of the linking number $L$ during an ideal MHD evolution is a direct consequence of the conservation of magnetic topology. The governing equation for the magnetic field in ideal MHD is the ideal induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\boldsymbol{v} \\times \\boldsymbol{B})\n$$\nThis equation implies that magnetic field lines are \"frozen\" into the conducting fluid and are transported by the plasma flow $\\boldsymbol{v}$. A key consequence of this \"frozen-in\" theorem is that the topology of the magnetic field is preserved. Field lines cannot break or merge. This prohibition of changes in field line connectivity is equivalent to stating that magnetic reconnection does not occur, which is an explicit condition of the problem.\n\nThe linking number $L$ is a topological invariant that quantifies how the axis curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ of the flux tubes are intertwined. To change the value of $L$, the field lines of one tube would have to pass through the field lines of the other. Such a process would require breaking and reconnecting the field lines, which is exactly what is forbidden in ideal MHD. Therefore, the linking number $L$ is a robust invariant of any ideal MHD flow. Since the individual fluxes $\\Phi_1$ and $\\Phi_2$ are also conserved by the frozen-in principle, the mutual helicity $H_{12} = 2L\\Phi_1\\Phi_2$ is also a conserved quantity during the ideal evolution.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nUsing the derived formula and the given initial values, we can compute the relative (mutual) helicity.\nGiven data:\n- Linking number, $L = 2$\n- Flux of tube 1, $\\Phi_1 = 0.37\\,\\mathrm{Wb}$\n- Flux of tube 2, $\\Phi_2 = 0.61\\,\\mathrm{Wb}$\n\nThe relative helicity is:\n$$\nH_{12} = 2 L \\Phi_1 \\Phi_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times (0.37) \\times (0.61)\n$$\n$$\nH_{12} = 4 \\times 0.2257 = 0.9028 \\, \\mathrm{Wb}^2\n$$\nThe result rounded to four significant figures is $0.9028$.\nThe expression for the relative helicity between the tubes is $2L\\Phi_1\\Phi_2$. This quantity is conserved under ideal MHD evolution because the individual fluxes $\\Phi_1, \\Phi_2$ and the topological linking number $L$ are all conserved quantities due to the frozen-in flux theorem.",

Your constraints must be expressed in terms of the following scheme parameters:\n- A hyperbolic Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constant $\\displaystyle C_{\\text{hyp}}$ such that $\\displaystyle \\Delta t_{\\text{hyp}} \\le C_{\\text{hyp}}\\,\\frac{\\Delta x}{c_{f}}$.\n- A whistler stability constant $\\displaystyle C_{\\text{wh}}$ using the maximum resolvable wavenumber $\\displaystyle k_{\\max} \\approx \\pi/\\Delta x$, i.e., $\\displaystyle \\Delta t_{\\text{wh}} \\le \\frac{C_{\\text{wh}}}{v_{A} d_{i} k_{\\max}^{2}}$ when $\\displaystyle v_{A} d_{i} &gt; 0$, and otherwise no Hall constraint.\n- A resistive stability constant $\\displaystyle C_{\\eta}$ such that $\\displaystyle \\Delta t_{\\eta} \\le C_{\\eta}\\,\\frac{\\Delta x^{2}}{\\eta_{m}}$.\nCombine them with a global safety factor $\\displaystyle S$ as $\\displaystyle \\Delta t = S \\,\\min\\{\\Delta t_{\\text{hyp}},\\Delta t_{\\text{wh}},\\Delta t_{\\eta}\\}$, with the convention that constraints that are not active (e.g., $\\displaystyle v_{A} d_{i} = 0$ or $\\displaystyle \\eta = 0$) are treated as $+\\infty$.\n\n3) Implement a program that, for each test case below, computes $\\displaystyle \\Delta t$ in seconds using the derived constraints. You must use International System of Units (SI) for all inputs and outputs. Use the following constants in SI units: $\\displaystyle \\mu_{0} = 4\\pi\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}$, elementary charge $\\displaystyle e = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$, and adiabatic index $\\displaystyle \\gamma = 5/3$ unless otherwise specified.\n\nAdopt the scheme parameters $\\displaystyle C_{\\text{hyp}} = 0.8$, $\\displaystyle C_{\\text{wh}} = 0.4$, $\\displaystyle C_{\\eta} = 0.5$, and $\\displaystyle S = 0.9$.\n\nYour program must evaluate the following five test cases, each defined by a tuple $\\displaystyle (\\rho, p, B_{0}, n_{e}, m_{i}, \\eta, \\Delta x)$, all in SI units:\n- Case A (tokamak core, moderate resistivity, moderate grid): $\\displaystyle \\rho = 3.345\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, $\\displaystyle p = 3.204\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\displaystyle B_{0} = 5\\,\\mathrm{T}$, $\\displaystyle n_{e} = 1\\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $\\displaystyle m_{i} = 3.345243848\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\displaystyle \\eta = 1\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{m}$, $\\displaystyle \\Delta x = 1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Case B (Hall-dominated by fine grid): $\\displaystyle \\rho = 3.345\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, $\\displaystyle p = 3.204\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\displaystyle B_{0} = 5\\,\\mathrm{T}$, $\\displaystyle n_{e} = 1\\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $\\displaystyle m_{i} = 3.345243848\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\displaystyle \\eta = 1\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{m}$, $\\displaystyle \\Delta x = 1\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Case C (resistive-dominated): $\\displaystyle \\rho = 3.345\\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, $\\displaystyle p = 1.000\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\displaystyle B_{0} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$, $\\displaystyle n_{e} = 1\\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $\\displaystyle m_{i} = 3.345243848\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\displaystyle \\eta = 1\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{m}$, $\\displaystyle \\Delta x = 1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Case D (weak field, sound-speed limited): $\\displaystyle \\rho = 3.345\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, $\\displaystyle p = 3.204\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\displaystyle B_{0} = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{T}$, $\\displaystyle n_{e} = 1\\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $\\displaystyle m_{i} = 3.345243848\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\displaystyle \\eta = 1\\times 10^{-7}\\,\\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{m}$, $\\displaystyle \\Delta x = 1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Case E (edge-like, strong field, fine grid, low density): $\\displaystyle \\rho = 3.345\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$, $\\displaystyle p = 1.000\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\displaystyle B_{0} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{T}$, $\\displaystyle n_{e} = 1\\times 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$, $\\displaystyle m_{i} = 3.345243848\\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\displaystyle \\eta = 1\\times 10^{-8}\\,\\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{m}$, $\\displaystyle \\Delta x = 5\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nOutput specification:\n- For each case, your program must compute the stable explicit time step $\\displaystyle \\Delta t$ in seconds.\n- Your program must produce a single line of output containing the results for Cases A through E in order, as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, e.g., $\\displaystyle [x_{A},x_{B},x_{C},x_{D},x_{E}]$, where each $\\displaystyle x_{i}$ is a floating-point number in seconds, formatted in scientific notation with exactly six significant digits (for example, $\\displaystyle 1.234560\\mathrm{e}{-3}$).",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of magnetohydrodynamics and numerical analysis of partial differential equations. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed with the derivation and implementation as requested.\n\nThe evolution of the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is governed by Faraday's law of induction:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe problem provides a truncated generalized Ohm's law for the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B} + \\eta\\,\\mathbf{J} + \\frac{1}{n_{e} e}\\,\\mathbf{J}\\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nwhere the terms on the right-hand side represent the ideal MHD, resistive, and Hall effects, respectively. Using Ampère's law, $\\mu_{0}\\,\\mathbf{J} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$, we can express the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ in terms of $\\mathbf{B}$. Substituting the expressions for $\\mathbf{E}$ and $\\mathbf{J}$ into Faraday's law yields the induction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla \\times \\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right) - \\nabla \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{n_{e} e \\mu_0} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right)\n$$\nFor a numerical solution using an explicit time integration method such as forward Euler, the time step $\\Delta t$ is limited by the fastest dynamics in the system. We analyze the stability constraint imposed by each of the three terms separately.\n\n1.  **Ideal (Hyperbolic) Contribution**: The term $\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{B})$ describes the advection of magnetic field lines with the plasma flow. This term gives rise to hyperbolic phenomena, namely MHD waves. The fastest possible propagation speed for any disturbance in an ideal MHD plasma is the fast magnetosonic speed, $c_f$. For a wave propagating perpendicular to the background magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_0$, this speed is given by $c_{f} = \\sqrt{c_{s}^{2}+v_{A}^{2}}$, where $c_{s} = \\sqrt{\\gamma p/\\rho}$ is the sound speed and $v_{A} = B_{0}/\\sqrt{\\mu_{0}\\rho}$ is the Alfvén speed. Using a forward-Euler time-stepping scheme with second-order central differences in space for a one-dimensional system with grid spacing $\\Delta x$, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition imposes a limit on the time step. The most restrictive case corresponds to the fastest speed, $c_f$. The stability constraint is:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t_{\\text{hyp}} \\le C_{\\text{hyp}}\\,\\frac{\\Delta x}{c_{f}}\n    $$\n    where $C_{\\text{hyp}}$ is a numerical constant of order unity, given as $0.8$.\n\n2.  **Resistive (Parabolic) Contribution**: The term $-\\nabla \\times (\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})$ describes the diffusion of the magnetic field. Assuming a uniform resistivity $\\eta$, and using the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$ along with the solenoidal constraint $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, this term simplifies to $\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$. The induction equation thus contains a diffusion term of the form $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\eta_m \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$, where $\\eta_m = \\eta/\\mu_0$ is the magnetic diffusivity. For the 1D diffusion equation discretized with forward-Euler in time and second-order central differences in space, the stability condition is $\\Delta t \\le \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2\\eta_m}$. The problem provides a generalized form:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t_{\\eta} \\le C_{\\eta}\\,\\frac{\\Delta x^{2}}{\\eta_{m}}\n    $$\n    with a given numerical constant $C_{\\eta} = 0.5$. If $\\eta=0$, then $\\eta_m=0$, and this constraint is inactive (i.e., $\\Delta t_{\\eta} \\to \\infty$).\n\n3.  **Hall (Dispersive) Contribution**: The term $-\\nabla \\times (\\frac{1}{n_{e} e \\mu_0} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B})$ is the Hall term, which becomes significant at scales comparable to the ion inertial length. To find its characteristic frequency, we linearize the equation for a small perturbation $\\mathbf{b}_1$ around a uniform background field $\\mathbf{B}_0 = B_0 \\hat{z}$ and a stationary plasma ($\\mathbf{v}=0$).\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{b}_1}{\\partial t} \\approx -\\frac{1}{n_{e} e \\mu_0} \\nabla \\times ((\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{b}_1) \\times \\mathbf{B}_0)\n    $$\n    Assuming a plane wave solution $\\mathbf{b}_1 \\propto \\exp(i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t))$ propagating parallel to the field ($\\mathbf{k} = k \\hat{z}$), the dispersion relation for these circularly polarized waves (whistler waves) is $\\omega(k) = \\pm \\frac{B_0}{n_e e \\mu_0} k^2$. The problem requires us to show the scaling $\\omega \\sim v_{A} d_{i} k^{2}$. The ion inertial length is $d_{i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{i}}{\\mu_{0} n_{e} e^{2}}}$ and the Alfvén speed is $v_{A} = \\frac{B_0}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\rho}}$. With plasma mass density $\\rho \\approx n_i m_i$ and quasi-neutrality $n_i \\approx n_e$, we have $\\rho \\approx n_e m_i$. The product is:\n    $$\n    v_A d_i = \\frac{B_0}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 n_e m_i}} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{\\mu_0 n_e e^2}} = \\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 n_e e}\n    $$\n    This confirms that the whistler dispersion relation is $\\omega(k) \\propto (v_A d_i) k^2$. This quadratic dependence of frequency on wavenumber imposes a severe stability constraint on explicit time-stepping schemes, which scales with $\\Delta x^2$. The shortest wavelength (largest wavenumber) resolvable on the grid is $k_{\\max} \\approx \\pi / \\Delta x$. The stability constraint is given as:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t_{\\text{wh}} \\le \\frac{C_{\\text{wh}}}{v_{A} d_{i} k_{\\max}^{2}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{wh}} \\Delta x^2}{(B_0 / (\\mu_0 n_e e)) \\pi^2}\n    $$\n    where $C_{\\text{wh}}$ is a numerical constant given as $0.4$. This constraint is active only if the Hall term is present, i.e., $B_0 > 0$. If $B_0=0$, the prefactor $v_A d_i = 0$, and this constraint is inactive ($\\Delta t_{\\text{wh}} \\to \\infty$).\n\n**Final Time Step Calculation**:\nTo ensure stability against all three physical processes, the overall time step $\\Delta t$ must be smaller than the minimum of the individual limits. A global safety factor $S$, given as $0.9$, is applied to stay safely below the stability boundary.\n$$\n\\Delta t = S \\cdot \\min(\\Delta t_{\\text{hyp}}, \\Delta t_{\\eta}, \\Delta t_{\\text{wh}})\n$$\nInactive constraints are treated as having an infinite time step limit, so they do not affect the minimum. We now implement this logic to compute $\\Delta t$ for the given test cases. All calculations are performed in SI units.",
