Starting from the fundamental relations of classical electrodynamics—Maxwell’s equations in magnetostatics and the Lorentz force density—derive, without quoting any pre-known stress formulas, the symmetric field stress that balances the Lorentz force in the static case.

            "solution": "The objective is to derive the symmetric field stress tensor that balances the Lorentz force in a magnetostatic regime and then compute its trace.\n\nThe fundamental force density on a medium from electromagnetic fields is the Lorentz force density, given by $\\mathbf{f} = \\rho\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{J}\\times\\mathbf{B}$, where $\\rho$ is the charge density, $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field. The problem specifies a magnetostatic regime where the electric field is negligible, i.e., $\\mathbf{E} \\approx \\mathbf{0}$. Under this condition, the Lorentz force density reduces to its magnetic component:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = \\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThe problem further states that the plasma currents are stationary, which is consistent with the magnetostatic approximation. In this regime, Maxwell's equations simplify. Specifically, Ampere's law in its magnetostatic form relates the current density to the magnetic field:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_0 \\mathbf{J}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space. We can use this equation to eliminate the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ from the force expression, thereby expressing the force solely in terms of the magnetic field:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the force density equation yields:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThe problem requires finding a symmetric stress tensor $\\mathbf{T}$ such that its divergence equals the force density, i.e., $\\mathbf{f} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{T}$. To derive the components $T_{ij}$ of this tensor, we work in Cartesian index notation. The $i$-th component of the force density is:\n$$\nf_i = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} [(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\times \\mathbf{B}]_i\n$$\nUsing the Levi-Civita symbol $\\epsilon_{ijk}$ to represent the cross product, we have:\n$$\nf_i = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\epsilon_{ijk} (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})_j B_k\n$$\nThe $j$-th component of the curl of $\\mathbf{B}$ is $(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})_j = \\epsilon_{jlm} \\partial_l B_m$, where $\\partial_l$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the $l$-th coordinate. Substituting this gives:\n$$\nf_i = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\epsilon_{ijk} (\\epsilon_{jlm} \\partial_l B_m) B_k\n$$\nWe use the identity for the product of two Levi-Civita symbols, $\\epsilon_{ijk}\\epsilon_{jlm} = \\epsilon_{kij}\\epsilon_{lmj} = \\delta_{kl}\\delta_{im} - \\delta_{km}\\delta_{il}$. Note the repeated index $j$ implies summation.\n$$\nf_i = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (\\delta_{kl}\\delta_{im} - \\delta_{km}\\delta_{il}) (\\partial_l B_m) B_k\n$$\nExpanding this expression by applying the Kronecker deltas:\n$$\nf_i = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} [(\\partial_k B_i) B_k - (\\partial_i B_k) B_k]\n$$\nThis expression is not yet in the form of a divergence of a tensor. We must manipulate it to get a single derivative operator $\\partial_j$ at the front. Let's analyze each term.\nFor the second term, we can use the product rule for derivatives: $B_k (\\partial_i B_k) = \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_i (B_k B_k) = \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_i (B^2)$, where $B^2 = \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = B_k B_k$ is the squared magnitude of the magnetic field.\nFor the first term, we again use the product rule: $B_k (\\partial_k B_i) = \\partial_k(B_k B_i) - (\\partial_k B_k)B_i$.\nAnother of Maxwell's equations is Gauss's law for magnetism, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, which in index notation is $\\partial_k B_k = 0$. Therefore, the term $(\\partial_k B_k)B_i$ vanishes, and we are left with $B_k (\\partial_k B_i) = \\partial_k(B_k B_i)$.\n\nSubstituting these modified terms back into the expression for $f_i$:\n$$\nf_i = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} [\\partial_k(B_k B_i) - \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_i(B^2)]\n$$\nTo express this as a single divergence, we rewrite the second term using a Kronecker delta: $\\partial_i(X) = \\delta_{ik} \\partial_k(X)$.\n$$\nf_i = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} [\\partial_k(B_i B_k) - \\partial_k(\\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ik} B^2)]\n$$\nHere, we have renamed the dummy index on the first term from $k$ to $j$ and on the second from $i,k$ to $i,j$. It is better to use a consistent dummy index, say $j$.\n$$\nf_i = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} [\\partial_j(B_i B_j) - \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_i(B^2)] = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} [\\partial_j(B_i B_j) - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ij}\\partial_j(B^2)]\n$$\nNow we can factor out the derivative $\\partial_j$:\n$$\nf_i = \\partial_j \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left( B_i B_j - \\frac{1}{2} \\delta_{ij} B^2 \\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis is of the form $f_i = \\partial_j T_{ji}$. The stress tensor that balances the Lorentz force is therefore:\n$$\nT_{ij} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left( B_i B_j - \\frac{1}{2} \\delta_{ij} B^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis tensor is symmetric ($T_{ij} = T_{ji}$). This is the magnetic part of the full Maxwell stress tensor.\n\nNext, we compute the trace of this tensor, $T_{kk}$, which is the sum of its diagonal elements. We use the Einstein summation convention where a repeated index implies summation over the dimensions of space ($k=1, 2, 3$).\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{T}) = T_{kk} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} T_{kk} = \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left( B_k B_k - \\frac{1}{2} \\delta_{kk} B^2 \\right)\n$$\nLet's evaluate the sum of each term.\nThe first term in the summation is $\\sum_{k=1}^{3} B_k B_k = B_1^2 + B_2^2 + B_3^2 = B^2$.\nThe second term involves the trace of the Kronecker delta, $\\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\delta_{kk} = \\delta_{11} + \\delta_{22} + \\delta_{33} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for the trace:\n$$\nT_{kk} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left( B^2 - \\frac{3}{2} B^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left( B^2 - \\frac{3}{2} B^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} B^2 \\right)\n$$\nThus, the trace of the magnetic stress tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{T}) = -\\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}\n$$\n\nFinally, we interpret this result.\nThe quantity $P_B = \\frac{B^2}{2\\mu_0}$ is the magnetic energy density, which numerically has units of pressure (Pascals in SI units). It is referred to as the magnetic pressure. The trace of the stress tensor, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{T})$, represents the sum of the normal stresses (forces per unit area) acting on surfaces oriented along the coordinate axes. A positive normal stress ($T_{ii} > 0$) corresponds to tension, while a negative normal stress ($T_{ii}  0$) corresponds to pressure.\nOur result, $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathbf{T}) = -P_B$, shows that the trace is negative and equal in magnitude to the magnetic pressure. Magnetic fields exert a tension of magnitude $P_B$ along the direction of the field lines and a pressure of equal magnitude $P_B$ in all directions perpendicular to the field lines. The trace is the sum of these effects: one tension ($+P_B$) and two pressures ($-P_B - P_B$), resulting in a net value of $-P_B$. The negative sign indicates that the overall effect of the normal stresses of a magnetic field is compressive (like a pressure).\n\nThe absence of electric-field contributions in this result is a direct consequence of the initial problem setup. The problem defines the context as a magnetostatic regime where the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is negligible. The full Maxwell stress tensor includes terms dependent on the electric field: $T_{ij}^{\\text{full}} = \\epsilon_0 (E_i E_j - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ij}E^2) + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} (B_i B_j - \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ij}B^2)$. Since we started with the premise that $\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{0}$, the electric field terms are identically zero, and the derivation naturally yields only the magnetic component of the stress tensor. The Lorentz force itself reduces to $\\mathbf{J} \\times \\mathbf{B}$, removing any dependence on $\\mathbf{E}$ from the very first step of the derivation.",

The normal component is $B_{2n} = \\mathbf{B}_{2} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{T}$, which confirms continuity. The tangential component is $\\mathbf{B}_{2t} = 6.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, so its squared magnitude is $B_{2t}^{2} = (6.0)^{2} = 36.0 \\ \\mathrm{T}^{2}$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $p_{n}$:\n$$\np_{n} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu_{0}} (16.0 - 36.0) = \\frac{-20.0}{2\\mu_{0}} = -\\frac{10.0}{\\mu_{0}}.\n$$\n\nMethod 2: Using the Surface Force Density\n\nThis method serves as a confirmation. The force per unit area on a surface current sheet $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{s}}$ is given by the Lorentz force expression $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{avg}}$, where $\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{avg}} = (\\mathbf{B}_{1} + \\mathbf{B}_{2})/2$ is the average magnetic field at the interface. The traction $p_n$ is the normal component of this force, $p_{n} = \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{s}}$.\n\nFirst, we find the surface current density $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{s}}$ from the boundary condition for the tangential magnetic field:\n$$\n\\mu_{0}\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\times (\\mathbf{B}_{2} - \\mathbf{B}_{1}).\n$$\nThe difference in the magnetic field is $\\mathbf{B}_{2} - \\mathbf{B}_{1} = (6.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + 1.0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) - (4.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + 1.0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = 2.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n$$\n\\mu_{0}\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times (2.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = 2.0\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}.\n$$\nSo, $\\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{2.0}{\\mu_{0}}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the average magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{avg}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{B}_{1} + \\mathbf{B}_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}((4.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + 1.0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) + (6.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + 1.0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})) = \\frac{1}{2}(10.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + 2.0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = 5.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + 1.0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}.\n$$\nNow, we calculate the force per unit area $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{s}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\mathbf{K}_{\\mathrm{s}} \\times \\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{avg}} = \\left(\\frac{2.0}{\\mu_{0}}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\right) \\times (5.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + 1.0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) = \\frac{2.0}{\\mu_{0}}(5.0(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) + 1.0(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{z}})).\n$$\nUsing the vector identities $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{2.0}{\\mu_{0}}(-5.0\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} + 1.0\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = \\frac{2.0}{\\mu_{0}}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\frac{10.0}{\\mu_{0}}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}.\n$$\nThe normal component of this force is the traction $p_n$:\n$$\np_{n} = \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\cdot \\mathbf{F}_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2.0}{\\mu_{0}}\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} - \\frac{10.0}{\\mu_{0}}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\right) = -\\frac{10.0}{\\mu_{0}}.\n$$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained from the Maxwell stress tensor, confirming the consistency of electromagnetism principles.\n\nNumerical Evaluation\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value of $p_n$.\nGiven $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{N} \\, \\mathrm{A}^{-2}$. The units of $B^2/\\mu_0$ are $\\mathrm{T}^2 / (\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{A}^2) = \\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2 = \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$\np_{n} = -\\frac{10.0}{\\mu_{0}} = -\\frac{10.0}{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}} \\ \\mathrm{Pa} = -\\frac{10.0 \\times 10^{7}}{4\\pi} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}.\n$$\n$$\np_{n} \\approx -7957747.15 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}.\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result in megapascals (MPa), rounded to four significant figures.\n$1 \\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n$$\np_{n} \\approx -7.95774715 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}.\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\np_{n} \\approx -7.958 \\ \\mathrm{MPa}.\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the net force on the interface is in the $-\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$ (i.e., $-\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$) direction. This is a tension, pulling the interface toward region 1, or equivalently, the magnetic pressure in region 2 is greater than in region 1, pushing the interface into region 1.",
