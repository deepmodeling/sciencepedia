            "problem": "A toroidally symmetric tokamak is equipped with a set of resonant magnetic perturbation (RMP) coils designed to produce a predominantly single toroidal harmonic. Consider a coil array of $N$ identical coils uniformly spaced at toroidal angles $\\varphi_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{N}$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$. Each coil is driven to produce a pure toroidal harmonic $n$ by setting its current to\n$$\nI_k = I_0 \\cos\\!\\big(n \\varphi_k - \\varphi_0\\big),\n$$\nwhere $I_0$ is the common per-coil current amplitude and $\\varphi_0$ is the common phase.\n\nIn vacuum (no plasma response), the magnetic field satisfies Maxwell's equations $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, and thus the magnetic field produced by currents is linearly superposable and the edge radial field harmonic can be expanded in a Fourier series in toroidal angle. The safety factor at $95\\%$ poloidal flux, denoted $q_{95}$, identifies the dominant resonant poloidal harmonic $m$ via $m/n \\approx q_{95}$, but for this problem the exact value of $m$ is not required. A calibration experiment has measured the vacuum transfer function at $q_{95}$ between the array’s toroidal-$n$ complex current amplitude and the edge radial magnetic field harmonic amplitude. The transfer function is defined as the complex ratio\n$$\nH \\equiv \\frac{\\delta b_r^{\\mathrm{vac}}(q_{95})}{I^{(n)}},\n$$\nwhere $I^{(n)}$ is the complex Fourier amplitude of the array’s $n$-th toroidal current component, and $\\delta b_r^{\\mathrm{vac}}(q_{95})$ is the complex amplitude of the edge radial field harmonic at $q_{95}$.

The concepts used—resonant magnetic perturbations, Fourier decomposition, safety factor, and transfer functions—are standard in computational fusion science. The physical and mathematical principles are sound. The provided numerical values for field strengths, coil numbers, and transfer function magnitude are physically realistic for a tokamak. The problem is well-defined, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. It is free from ambiguity, contradiction, and subjective content. The problem requires a standard application of discrete Fourier analysis and manipulation of complex numbers, representing a valid and non-trivial engineering calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is determined to be **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the per-coil current amplitude $I_0$ required to produce a specified edge radial magnetic field harmonic amplitude $B_{\\mathrm{tgt}}$. The solution requires relating the discrete coil currents $I_k$ to the total complex Fourier amplitude of the current, $I^{(n)}$, and then using the provided transfer function $H$ to connect $I^{(n)}$ to the resulting magnetic field.\n\nFirst, we must determine the relationship between the per-coil current amplitude $I_0$ and the complex amplitude of the $n$-th toroidal harmonic of the current array, $I^{(n)}$. The total current distribution can be thought of as a set of discrete sources. The complex amplitude of the $n$-th harmonic is found by performing a discrete Fourier transform. A standard definition for the un-normalized complex amplitude of the $n$-th harmonic from a set of $N$ discrete sources is the coherent sum of the phasors from each source:\n$$\nI^{(n)} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} I_k \\exp(-in\\varphi_k)\n$$\nThe current in each of the $N$ coils is given by $I_k = I_0 \\cos(n \\varphi_k - \\varphi_0)$. We use Euler's formula, $\\cos(x) = \\frac{\\exp(ix) + \\exp(-ix)}{2}$, to express $I_k$ in terms of complex exponentials:\n$$\nI_k = I_0 \\frac{\\exp\\big(i(n\\varphi_k - \\varphi_0)\\big) + \\exp\\big(-i(n\\varphi_k - \\varphi_0)\\big)}{2} = \\frac{I_0}{2} \\left[ \\exp(-i\\varphi_0) \\exp(in\\varphi_k) + \\exp(i\\varphi_0) \\exp(-in\\varphi_k) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $I^{(n)}$:\n$$\nI^{(n)} = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{I_0}{2} \\left[ \\exp(-i\\varphi_0) \\exp(in\\varphi_k) + \\exp(i\\varphi_0) \\exp(-in\\varphi_k) \\right] \\exp(-in\\varphi_k)\n$$\nDistributing the $\\exp(-in\\varphi_k)$ term and separating the sum:\n$$\nI^{(n)} = \\frac{I_0}{2} \\left[ \\exp(-i\\varphi_0) \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\big(i(n-n)\\varphi_k\\big) + \\exp(i\\varphi_0) \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\big(-i(n+n)\\varphi_k\\big) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nI^{(n)} = \\frac{I_0}{2} \\left[ \\exp(-i\\varphi_0) \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\exp(0) + \\exp(i\\varphi_0) \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\exp(-i2n\\varphi_k) \\right]\n$$\nThe first sum is $\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} 1 = N$. The second sum is a geometric series of the form $\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} (r)^k$ with $r = \\exp(-i2n \\frac{2\\pi}{N})$. The sum of such a series is $N$ if $r=1$ (i.e., the exponent's argument is a multiple of $2\\pi i$), and $0$ otherwise. Here, $r=1$ if $2n/N$ is an integer.\nUsing the given values $n=3$ and $N=12$, we have $2n/N = 6/12 = 1/2$, which is not an integer. Therefore, the second sum is zero.\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\exp(-i2n\\varphi_k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{4\\pi n k}{N}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThus, the expression for $I^{(n)}$ simplifies to:\n$$\nI^{(n)} = \\frac{I_0}{2} \\left[ \\exp(-i\\varphi_0) \\cdot N + \\exp(i\\varphi_0) \\cdot 0 \\right] = \\frac{N I_0}{2} \\exp(-i\\varphi_0)\n$$\nNow, we use the transfer function $H = \\frac{\\delta b_r^{\\mathrm{vac}}}{I^{(n)}}$ to relate the current to the magnetic field.\n$$\n\\delta b_r^{\\mathrm{vac}} = H \\cdot I^{(n)}\n$$\nSubstitute the complex forms of $H$ and $I^{(n)}$:\n$$\n\\delta b_r^{\\mathrm{vac}} = \\big(h \\exp(i\\alpha)\\big) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{N I_0}{2} \\exp(-i\\varphi_0)\\right) = \\frac{N h I_0}{2} \\exp\\big(i(\\alpha - \\varphi_0)\\big)\n$$\nThe problem requires the resulting field harmonic $\\delta b_r^{\\mathrm{vac}}$ to be a real, positive quantity equal to $B_{\\mathrm{tgt}}$. This imposes a condition on the phase of the complex expression.\n$$\n\\delta b_r^{\\mathrm{vac}} = B_{\\mathrm{tgt}}\n$$\nFor the right-hand side to be real and positive, its complex phase must be zero. This requires $\\exp\\big(i(\\alpha - \\varphi_0)\\big) = 1$, which implies $\\alpha - \\varphi_0 = 2\\pi j$ for some integer $j$. This fixes the necessary common phase of the coil currents to be $\\varphi_0 = \\alpha = 28^{\\circ}$ (or an equivalent angle).\nWith this phase condition satisfied, the relationship between the magnitudes is:\n$$\nB_{\\mathrm{tgt}} = \\frac{N h I_0}{2}\n$$\nWe can now solve for the per-coil current amplitude $I_0$:\n$$\nI_0 = \\frac{2 B_{\\mathrm{tgt}}}{N h}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $B_{\\mathrm{tgt}} = 1.34 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{T}$\n- $N = 12$\n- $h = 1.85 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{T/A}$\n$$\nI_0 = \\frac{2 \\times (1.34 \\times 10^{-3})}{12 \\times (1.85 \\times 10^{-7})} = \\frac{2.68 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.22 \\times 10^{-6}} \\ \\mathrm{A}\n$$\n$$\nI_0 = \\frac{2.68}{2.22} \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{A} \\approx 1207.207207... \\ \\mathrm{A}\n$$\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nI_0 \\approx 1207 \\ \\mathrm{A}\n$$\nThe final answer is the numerical value for the current amplitude $I_0$ in Amperes.",

The physical system is modeled as an effective single-turn circuit, a standard approach for analyzing the plasma's screening response at a rational surface.\n\nThe derivation begins with the circuit analogy provided in the problem statement. In the frequency domain, the relationship between the line-integrated electromotive force (EMF), which acts as the voltage $V$, the resulting screening current $I$, and the complex impedance of the resonant layer $Z$, is given by Ohm's law:\n$$V = I Z$$\nThe EMF is the parallel electric field $E_{\\parallel}$ integrated along the helical connection length $L_{\\parallel}$, so $V = E_{\\parallel} L_{\\parallel}$. The impedance $Z$ is complex, comprising a resistive part $R$ and an inductive part $i\\omega L$, where $\\omega$ is the relative frequency of the perturbation in the plasma frame. Thus, the circuit equation is:\n$$E_{\\parallel} L_{\\parallel} = I (R + i\\omega L)$$\nTo relate the amplitudes of these complex quantities, we take the magnitude of both sides of the equation:\n$$|E_{\\parallel} L_{\\parallel}| = |I (R + i\\omega L)|$$\nSince $E_{\\parallel}$ is defined as the amplitude of the parallel electric field, we can write $|E_{\\parallel}| = E_{\\parallel}$.

We can use this scaling to find the final resistivity, $\\eta_1$, in terms of the initial resistivity, $\\eta_0$:\n$$\\frac{\\eta_1}{\\eta_0} = \\left(\\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e0}}\\right)^{-3/2}$$\nSo, the final resistivity is:\n$$\\eta_1 = \\eta_0 \\left(\\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e0}}\\right)^{-3/2}$$\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the final electromagnetic torque, $T_{\\mathrm{EM},1}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{EM},1} = C\\,|b_{r}|^{2}\\,[\\eta_1]^{1/3}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\eta_1$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{EM},1} = C\\,|b_{r}|^{2}\\,\\left[\\eta_0 \\left(\\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e0}}\\right)^{-3/2}\\right]^{1/3}$$\nBy distributing the exponent $1/3$, we simplify the expression for $T_{\\mathrm{EM},1}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{EM},1} = C\\,|b_{r}|^{2}\\,\\eta_0^{1/3} \\left(\\left(\\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e0}}\\right)^{-3/2}\\right)^{1/3} = C\\,|b_{r}|^{2}\\,\\eta_0^{1/3} \\left(\\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e0}}\\right)^{-1/2}$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values:\n$C = 2.0 \\times 10^{15}$ (in SI-based units for torque)\n$b_r = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n$\\eta_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$\n$T_{e0} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n$T_{e1} = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the numerical value of $T_{\\mathrm{EM},1}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{EM},1} = (2.0 \\times 10^{15}) \\times |1.5 \\times 10^{-4}|^{2} \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-8})^{1/3} \\times \\left(\\frac{3.6}{3.0}\\right)^{-1/2}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{EM},1} = (2.0 \\times 10^{15}) \\times (2.25 \\times 10^{-8}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-8})^{1/3} \\times (1.2)^{-1/2}$$\nLet's evaluate the terms:\n$$(2.0 \\times 10^{-8})^{1/3} \\approx 2.7144 \\times 10^{-3}\\,(\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m})^{1/3}$$\n$$(1.2)^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1.2}} \\approx 0.91287$$\nNow, combine the numbers:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{EM},1} \\approx (4.5 \\times 10^{7}) \\times (2.7144 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 0.91287\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{EM},1} \\approx 1.1151 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$$\nFinally, we substitute this value into the equation for $\\omega_1$. The other given parameters are:\n$T_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 1.6 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$\n$\\alpha = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m\\cdot s}$\n$$\\omega_1 = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ext}} - T_{\\mathrm{EM},1}}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{5} - 1.1151 \\times 10^{5}}{1.0 \\times 10^{6}}$$\n$$\\omega_1 = \\frac{0.4849 \\times 10^{5}}{1.0 \\times 10^{6}} = 0.04849\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\omega_1 \\approx 0.0485\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$$\nWriting this in standard scientific notation gives $4.85 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.",
