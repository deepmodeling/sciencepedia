First, we must derive the relationship between the number density of dissolved tritium, $n_T$, the gas pressure, $p$, and the temperature, $T$, starting from fundamental thermodynamic principles. Second, we must use this relationship along with the provided data to compute a numerical value for $n_T$.\n\nThe system is at thermodynamic equilibrium, which means the chemical potentials of the species involved in the reaction are balanced. The reaction for the dissociation of molecular tritium gas and its absorption into the solid tungsten is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{T_2(g)} \\rightleftharpoons 2\\,\\mathrm{T(s)} $$\nwhere $\\mathrm{T_2(g)}$ represents a tritium molecule in the gas phase and $\\mathrm{T(s)}$ represents a tritium atom dissolved in the solid phase (tungsten). The condition for chemical equilibrium for this reaction is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{T_2, gas}} = 2 \\mu_{\\mathrm{T, solid}} $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\mathrm{T_2, gas}}$ is the chemical potential of the molecular tritium in the gas phase and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{T, solid}}$ is the chemical potential of atomic tritium dissolved in the solid.\n\nThe chemical potential of the tritium gas, assuming it behaves as an ideal gas, can be written as:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{T_2, gas}}(T, p) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{T_2, gas}}^0(T) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{p^0}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\mathrm{T_2, gas}}^0(T)$ is the standard chemical potential of the gas at temperature $T$ and a reference pressure $p^0$ (we can set $p^0 = 1$ Pa for convenience), and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe chemical potential of the tritium atoms dissolved in the solid is determined by the enthalpy of placing an atom in an interstitial site and the entropy of arranging the atoms among the available sites. For a dilute solution, the chemical potential is given by:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{T, solid}}(T, n_T) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{T, solid}}^\\infty(T) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_T}{n_{sites}}\\right) $$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\mathrm{T, solid}}^\\infty(T)$ is the standard chemical potential at infinite dilution (including enthalpic and vibrational contributions), $n_T$ is the number density of dissolved tritium atoms, and $n_{sites}$ is the number density of available interstitial sites in the tungsten lattice. The term $\\ln(n_T/n_{sites})$ arises from the ideal entropy of mixing for a dilute solution ($n_T \\ll n_{sites}$).\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the equilibrium condition:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{T_2, gas}}^0(T) + k_B T \\ln(p) = 2 \\left[ \\mu_{\\mathrm{T, solid}}^\\infty(T) + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_T}{n_{sites}}\\right) \\right] $$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $n_T$:\n$$ k_B T \\ln(p) - 2 k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_T}{n_{sites}}\\right) = 2 \\mu_{\\mathrm{T, solid}}^\\infty(T) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{T_2, gas}}^0(T) $$\n$$ \\ln(p) - \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{n_T}{n_{sites}}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{2 \\mu_{\\mathrm{T, solid}}^\\infty(T) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{T_2, gas}}^0(T)}{k_B T} $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p \\cdot n_{sites}^2}{n_T^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta G_{sol}^0(T)}{k_B T} $$\nwhere $\\Delta G_{sol}^0(T) = 2 \\mu_{\\mathrm{T, solid}}^\\infty(T) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{T_2, gas}}^0(T)$ is the standard Gibbs free energy of solution per molecule of $\\mathrm{T_2}$.\nExponentiating both sides:\n$$ \\frac{p \\cdot n_{sites}^2}{n_T^2} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{sol}^0(T)}{k_B T}\\right) $$\nSolving for $n_T$:\n$$ n_T^2 = p \\cdot n_{sites}^2 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{sol}^0(T)}{k_B T}\\right) $$\n$$ n_T = \\sqrt{p} \\left[ n_{sites} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_{sol}^0(T)}{2 k_B T}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis derivation shows that the dissolved tritium number density $n_T$ is proportional to the square root of the gas pressure $p$, a relationship known as Sieverts' law.
