            "problem": "Consider an axisymmetric tokamak plasma undergoing small vertical excursions relevant to Vertical Displacement Events (VDEs). The equilibrium is governed by the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) balance and the axisymmetric Grad–Shafranov equation, with the external poloidal flux boundary condition $\\psi|_{\\Gamma}=\\psi_{\\mathrm{coil}}(t)$ imposed on the computational boundary $\\Gamma$. Two classes of solutions are commonly used: fixed-boundary, where $\\Gamma$ is a prescribed curve in real space, and free-boundary, where $\\Gamma$ is determined self-consistently with currents in both the plasma and external coils.\n\nAssume a circular cross-section plasma of major radius $R_{0}$ and minor radius small enough that rigid vertical shifts $Z$ of the plasma column are a good approximation for the $n=0$ vertical mode. The plasma carries a total toroidal current $I_{p}$ concentrated within the plasma cross-section. An external, up-down antisymmetric poloidal field coil pair supplies a time-dependent current $I_{c}(t)$ which, in the neighborhood of the magnetic axis at $(R_{0},Z)$, produces a radial magnetic field that is well approximated by the linearization\n$$\nB_{R}(R_{0},Z;t)\\approx \\beta\\, I_{c}(t)+\\kappa\\, Z,\n$$\nwhere $\\beta=\\partial B_{R}/\\partial I_{c}$ and $\\kappa=\\partial B_{R}/\\partial Z$ are evaluated at $(R_{0},Z=0)$ for the nominal equilibrium. The plasma shaping and internal profiles provide an effective vertical stiffness $K_{v}$, such that small vertical displacements $Z$ produce a restoring vertical force $-K_{v}\\, Z$. You may treat $K_{v}$ as a lumped parameter derived from the ideal MHD energy principle for the $n=0$ mode.\n\nUsing first principles (the Lorentz force density $\\mathbf{f}=\\mathbf{j}\\times\\mathbf{B}$ and axisymmetric geometry), derive the linearized relation between a small coil-current perturbation $\\delta I_{c}$ and the resulting plasma vertical displacement $\\delta Z$ in the free-boundary case, by enforcing net vertical force balance between plasma internal restoring forces and the external magnetic force from $B_{R}$. Explain why, under the fixed-boundary Grad–Shafranov solution with the Dirichlet boundary condition $\\psi|_{\\Gamma}=\\psi_{\\mathrm{coil}}(t)$ on a geometrically fixed $\\Gamma$, the vertical position is not changed by $\\delta I_{c}$.\n\nEvaluate your free-boundary expression numerically for the following parameters and report the displacement corresponding to $\\Delta I_{c}=1\\,\\mathrm{kA}$:\n- Major radius $R_{0}=3\\,\\mathrm{m}$,\n- Plasma current $I_{p}=10\\,\\mathrm{MA}$,\n- Radial-field coil sensitivity $\\beta=0.4\\,\\mathrm{mT}/\\mathrm{kA}$,\n- Local vertical gradient of the coil-generated radial field $\\kappa=-1.5\\,\\mathrm{mT}/\\mathrm{m}$,\n- Effective vertical stiffness $K_{v}=8\\,\\mathrm{MN}/\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nSelect the option that correctly characterizes both the fixed-boundary versus free-boundary response and gives the correct numerical free-boundary displacement for $\\Delta I_{c}=1\\,\\mathrm{kA}$.\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided physical model is a standard, albeit simplified, representation used in computational fusion science for analyzing plasma vertical stability. All parameters are defined and have physically realistic values and consistent units. No invalidating flaws are identified. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for two main derivations: the response of the plasma vertical position $\\delta Z$ to a coil current perturbation $\\delta I_c$ in a free-boundary model, and an explanation for the behavior in a fixed-boundary model. This is followed by a numerical evaluation for the free-boundary case.\n\n**Part 1: Free-Boundary Model Derivation**\n\nIn the free-boundary case, the plasma's vertical position $Z$ is a dynamic variable determined by the net vertical force balance. The problem models the plasma as a rigid toroidal current loop. The total vertical force $F_{Z, \\text{total}}$ acting on this loop has two components:\n1.  The internal restoring force, $F_{\\text{restore}}$, which arises from the interaction of the plasma current with the magnetic field generated by shaping coils (not the control coils considered here) and the vacuum vessel wall currents (if any). This is given as a linearized restoring force $-K_v Z$, where $K_v > 0$ denotes a stabilizing effect.\n2.  The external force, $F_{\\text{ext}}$, due to the interaction of the total toroidal plasma current $I_p$ with the externally applied radial magnetic field $B_R$.\n\nThe Lorentz force, $\\mathbf{F} = \\int (\\mathbf{I} \\, d\\mathbf{l}) \\times \\mathbf{B}$, gives the total force on a current loop. For a toroidal current $I_p$ (in the $\\hat{\\phi}$ direction) in a magnetic field $\\mathbf{B} = B_R \\hat{R} + B_Z \\hat{Z}$, the force element is $d\\mathbf{F} = I_p (R \\, d\\phi \\, \\hat{\\phi}) \\times (B_R \\hat{R} + B_Z \\hat{Z})$. Using a cylindrical coordinate system $(R, \\phi, Z)$ where $\\hat{\\phi} \\times \\hat{R} = \\hat{Z}$, the vertical component of the force element is $dF_Z = I_p R B_R d\\phi$. Assuming axisymmetry ($n=0$ mode), $B_R$ is constant along the toroidal path. Integrating over the full torus of major radius $R_0$ gives the total external vertical force:\n$$F_{\\text{ext}} = \\int_0^{2\\pi} I_p R_0 B_R d\\phi = 2\\pi R_0 I_p B_R$$\n\nThe total vertical force on the plasma is the sum of the restoring and external forces:\n$$F_{Z, \\text{total}}(Z, I_c) = F_{\\text{restore}} + F_{\\text{ext}} = -K_v Z + 2\\pi R_0 I_p B_R(Z, I_c)$$\nThe problem provides the linearized expression for the control field near the midplane ($Z=0$):\n$$B_R(R_0, Z; t) \\approx \\beta I_c(t) + \\kappa Z$$\nSubstituting this into the force equation yields:\n$$F_{Z, \\text{total}}(Z, I_c) = -K_v Z + 2\\pi R_0 I_p (\\beta I_c + \\kappa Z)$$\nFor the plasma to be in a static equilibrium, this total force must be zero: $F_{Z, \\text{total}} = 0$.\n$$-K_v Z + 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\beta I_c + 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa Z = 0$$\nTo find the relationship between a small perturbation in coil current, $\\delta I_c$, and the resulting change in equilibrium vertical position, $\\delta Z$, we consider perturbations around an initial equilibrium $(Z_0, I_{c0})$. The change in force must be zero to reach a new equilibrium: $\\delta F_{Z, \\text{total}} = 0$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial F_{Z, \\text{total}}}{\\partial Z} \\delta Z + \\frac{\\partial F_{Z, \\text{total}}}{\\partial I_c} \\delta I_c = 0$$\nCalculating the partial derivatives from the total force expression:\n$$\\frac{\\partial F_{Z, \\text{total}}}{\\partial Z} = -K_v + 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial F_{Z, \\text{total}}}{\\partial I_c} = 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\beta$$\nSubstituting these into the linearized force balance equation:\n$$(-K_v + 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa) \\delta Z + (2\\pi R_0 I_p \\beta) \\delta I_c = 0$$\nSolving for the displacement $\\delta Z$ as a function of the current perturbation $\\delta I_c$:\n$$\\delta Z = \\frac{-2\\pi R_0 I_p \\beta}{-K_v + 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa} \\delta I_c = \\left( \\frac{2\\pi R_0 I_p \\beta}{K_v - 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa} \\right) \\delta I_c$$\nThis equation shows that the displacement $\\delta Z$ is linearly proportional to the current change $\\delta I_c$. The term in the denominator, $K_v - 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa$, represents the total vertical stiffness of the system. For vertical stability, this stiffness must be positive: $K_v - 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa > 0$. The term $-2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa$ is the contribution to stiffness from the external field's spatial variation; a negative $\\kappa$ (where the field lines curve inward, \"barrel shape\") is stabilizing.\n\n**Part 2: Fixed-Boundary Model Explanation**\n\nIn a fixed-boundary Grad-Shafranov solution, the computational domain is bounded by a curve $\\Gamma$ that is fixed in space coordinates $(R, Z)$. The solver finds the poloidal flux function $\\psi(R, Z)$ that satisfies the MHD equilibrium equation inside $\\Gamma$ subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition, $\\psi|_{\\Gamma} = \\psi_{\\mathrm{coil}}(t)$. The plasma itself is contained within the last closed flux surface (LCFS), which must lie inside or on $\\Gamma$.\n\nIn this framework, the plasma does not exist as an independent rigid body that can be displaced. Its shape and position are emergent properties of the solution $\\psi(R, Z)$ within the fixed grid. A rigid vertical displacement of the entire plasma current distribution, by an amount $\\delta Z$, is not a degree of freedom in the model. If the boundary $\\Gamma$ is held fixed, the plasma is, by construction, confined within it. Therefore, a change in the coil currents $\\delta I_c$ changes the boundary condition $\\psi_{\\mathrm{coil}}(t)$, which will modify the internal flux distribution and may cause a small shift in the magnetic axis or a change in the plasma shape, but a rigid displacement of the entire plasma column is precluded by the fixed computational boundary. Thus, within the context of the rigid displacement mode $Z$ discussed in this problem, the fixed-boundary solution constrains $\\delta Z = 0$ by construction.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now calculate the numerical value of the free-boundary displacement $\\delta Z$ for a perturbation $\\Delta I_c = 1\\,\\mathrm{kA}$. The parameters are:\n-   $R_0 = 3\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $I_p = 10\\,\\mathrm{MA} = 10 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{A} = 10^7\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n-   $\\Delta I_c = \\delta I_c = 1\\,\\mathrm{kA} = 10^3\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n-   $\\beta = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{mT}/\\mathrm{kA} = 0.4 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T} / 10^3\\,\\mathrm{A} = 4 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{T}/\\mathrm{A}$\n-   $\\kappa = -1.5\\,\\mathrm{mT}/\\mathrm{m} = -1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}/\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $K_v = 8\\,\\mathrm{MN}/\\mathrm{m} = 8 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator of the sensitivity term, $N = 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\beta$:\n$$N = 2\\pi (3\\,\\mathrm{m}) (10^7\\,\\mathrm{A}) (4 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{T}/\\mathrm{A}) = 24\\pi\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{A} \\approx 75.398\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{A}$$\nNext, calculate the denominator, $D = K_v - 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa$:\nThe second term is $2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa = 2\\pi (3\\,\\mathrm{m})(10^7\\,\\mathrm{A})(-1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}/\\mathrm{m}) = -9\\pi \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m} \\approx -2.827 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$D = (8 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}) - (-2.827 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}) = (8 \\times 10^6 + 0.2827 \\times 10^6)\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m} = 8.2827 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}$$\nSince the denominator is positive, the equilibrium is stable as asserted by the problem's implicit assumptions. The sensitivity is:\n$$\\frac{\\delta Z}{\\delta I_c} = \\frac{N}{D} = \\frac{75.398\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{A}}{8.2827 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 9.103 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{A}$$\nFinally, calculate the displacement for $\\delta I_c = 10^3\\,\\mathrm{A}$:\n$$\\delta Z = (9.103 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{A}) \\times (10^3\\,\\mathrm{A}) = 9.103 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = +9.103\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe displacement for a $1\\,\\mathrm{kA}$ change in coil current is approximately $+9.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. In free-boundary modeling, $\\delta Z$ is linearly proportional to $\\delta I_{c}$ with sensitivity enhanced or reduced by the local vertical gradient $\\kappa$; the fixed-boundary solution keeps $\\delta Z=0$ by construction. For the given parameters, the free-boundary displacement is approximately $+9.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ per $\\Delta I_{c}=1\\,\\mathrm{kA}$.**\n-   The qualitative description of the free-boundary model matches our derived relation $\\delta Z \\propto \\delta I_c$, and the sensitivity $\\frac{2\\pi R_0 I_p \\beta}{K_v - 2\\pi R_0 I_p \\kappa}$ explicitly depends on $\\kappa$.\n-   The description of the fixed-boundary case ($\\delta Z = 0$ by construction) is correct for a rigid displacement mode.\n-   The numerical value of $+9.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ precisely matches our calculation.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Both fixed-boundary and free-boundary solutions yield the same nonzero vertical displacement because the Dirichlet boundary condition enforces $\\psi|_{\\Gamma}=\\psi_{\\mathrm{coil}}(t)$, which directly sets $\\delta Z$. For the given parameters, the displacement is approximately $+9.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ per $\\Delta I_{c}=1\\,\\mathrm{kA}$.**\n-   The claim that fixed- and free-boundary solutions yield the same displacement is fundamentally incorrect; it negates the primary distinction between the two modeling approaches.\n-   The numerical value of $+9.4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is incorrect. It appears to be derived by neglecting the external field stiffness term: $\\delta Z \\approx (2\\pi R_0 I_p \\beta / K_v) \\delta I_c = (75.398 / (8 \\times 10^6)) \\times 10^3 \\approx 9.42\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. This is physically incomplete.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. In free-boundary modeling, the vertical displacement sensitivity does not include the toroidal circumference factor, so the response is much smaller; fixed-boundary also permits nonzero $\\delta Z$ if $\\psi_{\\mathrm{coil}}(t)$ changes. For the given parameters, the displacement is approximately $+1.45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ per $\\Delta I_{c}=1\\,\\mathrm{kA}$.**\n-   The claim that the toroidal circumference factor $2\\pi R_0$ is excluded is physically incorrect. The Lorentz force acts on the entire length of the current loop.\n-   The numerical value of $+1.45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is incorrect. It is obtained by incorrectly dividing our result of $9.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ by $2\\pi$, which corresponds to the erroneous omission of this factor in the numerator of the sensitivity.\n-   The claim that fixed-boundary permits nonzero $\\delta Z$ (for a rigid shift) is inconsistent with the model definition.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The free-boundary equilibrium is unstable under the given parameters because the denominator of the sensitivity is negative, so any $\\delta I_{c}$ causes runaway $\\delta Z$; fixed-boundary prevents the instability and gives a finite nonzero $\\delta Z$. For the given parameters, the displacement is approximately $-50\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ per $\\Delta I_{c}=1\\,\\mathrm{kA}$.**\n-   The claim of instability is false. We calculated the denominator (total stiffness) to be $D \\approx +8.28 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}$, which is positive, indicating a stable equilibrium.\n-   The numerical value is incorrect and its sign and magnitude are inconsistent with a stable response.\n-   The claim that fixed-boundary gives a finite non-zero displacement is, again, incorrect in this context.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

These poles dictate the transient behavior and stability of the system. The characteristic polynomial is $D(s) = s(ms^2 + \\gamma s + k)(L_p s + R_p)(L_c s + R_c)$. The poles are:\n1.  $s_1 = 0$: This pole originates from the step-function voltage input $V_0 u(t)$. It governs the asymptotic steady-state response of the system.\n2.  $s_2 = -R_c/L_c$: This is a real pole corresponding to the $L/R$ time of the control coil circuit, $\\tau_c = L_c/R_c$. It represents the natural exponential decay rate of transient currents in this coil.\n3.  $s_3 = -R_p/L_p$: This is a real pole corresponding to the $L/R$ time of the plasma circuit, $\\tau_p = L_p/R_p$. It represents the resistive decay time of the plasma current.\n4.  $s_{4,5} = \\frac{-\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{\\gamma^2 - 4mk}}{2m}$: These poles arise from the mechanical dynamics of the plasma column. Their nature depends on the parameters $m$, $\\gamma$, and $k$.\n    *   If $k>0$ and $\\gamma>0$ (assuming $m>0$), the plasma position is passively stable and damped. The poles have negative real parts, representing a stable equilibrium. The motion will be either overdamped (two real, negative poles if $\\gamma^2 > 4mk$) or underdamped (a complex conjugate pair if $\\gamma^2  4mk$), corresponding to exponential decay or damped oscillations towards equilibrium.\n    *   If $k0$, the plasma position is passively unstable. The term $k Z_c$ represents a force that pushes the plasma further from equilibrium. In this case, at least one of these two poles will have a positive real part, e.g., for $\\gamma \\ge 0$, $\\sqrt{\\gamma^2-4mk} > \\gamma$, so $-\\gamma + \\sqrt{\\gamma^2-4mk} > 0$. This positive real pole corresponds to an exponential growth of the displacement, which is the defining characteristic of a VDE.\n\n**Task 3: Asymptotic Steady-State Vertical Displacement $Z_{\\infty}$**\n\nTo find the final steady-state displacement $Z_{\\infty} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} Z_c(t)$, we can use the Final Value Theorem (FVT) of the Laplace transform, which states $Z_{\\infty} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\hat{Z}_c(s)$.\n\nThe FVT is applicable only if the system is stable, meaning all poles of $s\\hat{Z}_c(s)$ lie in the left half of the complex plane. This requires the poles $s_2$, $s_3$, $s_4$, and $s_5$ to have negative real parts. This implies physical parameters $L_c, R_c, L_p, R_p, m, \\gamma$ must be positive, and critically, the stiffness $k$ must also be positive ($k>0$). Under these stability conditions, the system will settle to a finite steady state.\n\nApplying the FVT:\n$$ Z_{\\infty} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\left( \\frac{(ms + \\gamma)Z_0}{ms^2 + \\gamma s + k} + \\frac{V_0 \\left( (K_c L_p - K_p M)s + K_c R_p \\right)}{s(ms^2 + \\gamma s + k)(L_p s + R_p)(L_c s + R_c)} \\right) $$\nWe evaluate the limit of each term separately:\n$$ \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\frac{(ms + \\gamma)Z_0}{ms^2 + \\gamma s + k} = \\frac{0 \\cdot (\\gamma Z_0)}{k} = 0 $$\nThis term, corresponding to the initial conditions, decays to zero in a stable system.\n$$ \\lim_{s\\to 0} s \\frac{V_0 \\left( (K_c L_p - K_p M)s + K_c R_p \\right)}{s(ms^2 + \\gamma s + k)(L_p s + R_p)(L_c s + R_c)} = \\lim_{s\\to 0} \\frac{V_0 \\left( (K_c L_p - K_p M)s + K_c R_p \\right)}{(ms^2 + \\gamma s + k)(L_p s + R_p)(L_c s + R_c)} $$\nSubstituting $s=0$ into the expression:\n$$ Z_{\\infty} = \\frac{V_0 (0 + K_c R_p)}{(0 + 0 + k)(0 + R_p)(0 + R_c)} = \\frac{V_0 K_c R_p}{k R_p R_c} = \\frac{K_c V_0}{k R_c} $$\nThis result can be verified by analyzing the steady state ($d/dt \\to 0$) of the original ODEs. At $t \\to \\infty$, $I_c(\\infty) = V_0/R_c$ and $I_p(\\infty) = 0$ (since the inductive drive from $I_c$ ceases). The force balance becomes $k Z_c(\\infty) = K_c I_c(\\infty)$, yielding the same result.\n\nThe final request to express the answer in meters is satisfied if the parameters are given in SI units. A dimensional analysis confirms that the expression for $Z_{\\infty}$ has units of length: $[Z_{\\infty}] = [K_c][V_0]/([k][R_c]) = (\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{A}^{-1}) \\cdot \\text{V} / ((\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-1}) \\cdot \\Omega) = (\\text{V} \\cdot \\text{A}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{m}) / \\Omega = (\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}) / \\Omega = \\text{m}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. All necessary physical laws, material properties, and boundary conditions are provided to derive the scaling law and compute the required ratio.\n\nThe first step is to derive the characteristic magnetic diffusion time, $\\tau_w$. This is a fundamental quantity in magnetohydrodynamics and electromagnetism, describing the time scale on which a magnetic field penetrates a conductor. The derivation begins with the relevant Maxwell's equations and Ohm's law. In a good conductor on the time scales of interest for a Vertical Displacement Event (VDE), from milliseconds to seconds, the displacement current term in Ampère's law is negligible.\n\nThe governing equations are:\n1.  Faraday's Law of Induction:\n    $$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t} $$\n2.  Ampère's Law (neglecting displacement current):\n    $$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\vec{J} $$\n3.  Ohm's Law for a conductor:\n    $$ \\vec{J} = \\sigma(T) \\vec{E} $$\n\nHere, $\\vec{E}$ is the electric field, $\\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\\vec{J}$ is the eddy current density in the wall, $\\mu_0$ is the magnetic permeability of free space, and $\\sigma(T)$ is the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of the wall material.\n\nWe seek an equation solely in terms of $\\vec{B}$. We can combine these equations. First, substitute Ohm's law into Ampère's law to eliminate $\\vec{J}$:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\sigma(T) \\vec{E} $$\nTo eliminate $\\vec{E}$, we take the curl of this equation. Assuming the conductivity $\\sigma(T)$ is spatially uniform across the thin slab at any given moment (as the temperature $T$ is assumed to be uniform), we can treat it as a constant with respect to spatial derivatives:\n$$ \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{B}) = \\nabla \\times (\\mu_0 \\sigma(T) \\vec{E}) = \\mu_0 \\sigma(T) (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) $$\nUsing the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\vec{A}$ on the left-hand side, we get:\n$$ \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\sigma(T) (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) $$\nFrom Gauss's law for magnetism, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{B} = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ -\\nabla^2 \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\sigma(T) (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) $$\nNow, we substitute Faraday's law for the term $(\\nabla \\times \\vec{E})$:\n$$ -\\nabla^2 \\vec{B} = \\mu_0 \\sigma(T) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t}\\right) $$\nRearranging gives the magnetic diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\vec{B}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma(T)} \\nabla^2 \\vec{B} $$\nThis is a standard diffusion equation of the form $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 \\phi$, where the magnetic diffusivity is $D = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\sigma(T)}$.\n\nThe characteristic time $\\tau$ for a diffusion process to occur over a characteristic length scale $L$ is given by the scaling $\\tau \\sim \\frac{L^2}{D}$. The problem states that the dominant process is magnetic diffusion across the wall thickness, so the relevant length scale is $L = t_w$. Therefore, the characteristic wall magnetic diffusion time, $\\tau_w$, is:\n$$ \\tau_w \\approx \\frac{t_w^2}{D} = \\frac{t_w^2}{1/(\\mu_0 \\sigma(T))} = \\mu_0 \\sigma(T) t_w^2 $$\nThe problem may be more formally solved by considering a one-dimensional slab geometry, which introduces a dimensionless geometric factor (e.g., $1/\\pi^2$), but for determining the scaling, this is sufficient. The scaling relationship is $\\tau_w \\propto \\sigma(T) t_w^2$.\n\nNext, we compute the ratio $\\frac{\\tau_w(T_h)}{\\tau_w(T_c)}$ for the wall heating from a cold temperature $T_c = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$ to a hot temperature $T_h = 1100\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_w(T_h)}{\\tau_w(T_c)} = \\frac{\\mu_0 \\sigma(T_h) t_w^2}{\\mu_0 \\sigma(T_c) t_w^2} $$\nThe constants $\\mu_0$ and $t_w$ (assumed independent of temperature) cancel, leaving:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_w(T_h)}{\\tau_w(T_c)} = \\frac{\\sigma(T_h)}{\\sigma(T_c)} $$\nConductivity $\\sigma(T)$ is the reciprocal of resistivity $\\rho(T)$, so $\\sigma(T) = [\\rho(T)]^{-1}$. The ratio becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_w(T_h)}{\\tau_w(T_c)} = \\frac{[\\rho(T_h)]^{-1}}{[\\rho(T_c)]^{-1}} = \\frac{\\rho(T_c)}{\\rho(T_h)} $$\nWe are given the linear model for resistivity:\n$$ \\rho(T) = \\rho_0 \\left[1 + \\alpha (T - T_0)\\right] $$\nwith parameters $\\rho_0 = 7.4 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}$ at $T_0 = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, and $\\alpha = 9.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nWe evaluate the resistivity at the cold and hot temperatures.\nFor the cold state, $T_c = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$, which is equal to the reference temperature $T_0$.\n$$ \\rho(T_c) = \\rho(300\\ \\mathrm{K}) = \\rho_0 \\left[1 + \\alpha (300\\ \\mathrm{K} - 300\\ \\mathrm{K})\\right] = \\rho_0 [1 + 0] = \\rho_0 $$\nFor the hot state, $T_h = 1100\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$ \\rho(T_h) = \\rho(1100\\ \\mathrm{K}) = \\rho_0 \\left[1 + \\alpha (1100\\ \\mathrm{K} - 300\\ \\mathrm{K})\\right] = \\rho_0 \\left[1 + \\alpha (800\\ \\mathrm{K})\\right] $$\nNow we can compute the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_w(T_h)}{\\tau_w(T_c)} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_0 \\left[1 + \\alpha (800\\ \\mathrm{K})\\right]} = \\frac{1}{1 + 800 \\alpha} $$\nSubstituting the value of $\\alpha = 9.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_w(T_h)}{\\tau_w(T_c)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 800\\ \\mathrm{K} \\cdot (9.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})} $$\nThe product in the denominator is:\n$$ 800 \\times 9.5 \\times 10^{-4} = 8 \\times 10^2 \\times 9.5 \\times 10^{-4} = 76 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.76 $$\nSo the ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_w(T_h)}{\\tau_w(T_c)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.76} = \\frac{1}{1.76} $$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{1.76} \\approx 0.56818181... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $0.5682$.\nThis result shows that as the wall heats up, its resistivity increases, its conductivity decreases, and thus the magnetic diffusion time decreases, meaning the wall becomes less effective at shielding rapidly changing magnetic fields.",
