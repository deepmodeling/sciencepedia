It is defined as the product of the number of fusion reactions per unit volume per unit time (the fusion reaction rate density, $R_{f}$), the kinetic energy of the alpha particle produced in each reaction ($E_{\\alpha}$), and the fraction of this energy that is deposited locally in the plasma ($f_{\\alpha}$).\n\nThe expression for the volumetric alpha heating power density is therefore:\n$$\np_{\\alpha} = f_{\\alpha} R_{f} E_{\\alpha}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Fusion reaction rate density, $R_{f} = 1.0 \\times 10^{20} \\, \\text{m}^{-3} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$\n- Alpha particle energy, $E_{\\alpha} = 3.5 \\, \\text{MeV}$\n- Alpha particle energy deposition fraction, $f_{\\alpha} = 1$\n\nTo calculate $p_{\\alpha}$ in SI units (Watts per cubic meter), the energy $E_{\\alpha}$ must be converted from mega-electron-volts ($MeV$) to Joules ($J$).

We will first derive this figure-of-merit from the provided definitions and then calculate its value for the given plasma parameters. Finally, we will compute the ignition margin, $M$, by comparing this value to the specified ignition threshold.\n\nThe fundamental principle for a self-sustaining, or ignited, plasma is that the heating power generated within the plasma must balance or exceed the power lost from the plasma. In a D-T fusion plasma, the primary source of self-heating is from the energetic alpha particles ($^4\\text{He}$ nuclei) produced in the fusion reactions. The condition for ignition is therefore $P_{\\alpha} \\ge P_{loss}$, where $P_{\\alpha}$ is the volumetric alpha heating power and $P_{loss}$ is the volumetric power loss.\n\nThe problem defines the energy confinement time, $\\tau_{E}$, as the ratio of the stored thermal energy, $W_{th}$, to the total power loss, $P_{loss}$.\n$$P_{loss} = \\frac{W_{th}}{\\tau_{E}}$$\nThus, the ignition condition can be written as:\n$$P_{\\alpha} \\ge \\frac{W_{th}}{\\tau_{E}}$$\n\nNext, we must formalize the expressions for $W_{th}$ and $P_{\\alpha}$.\n\nThe volumetric thermal energy density, $W_{th}$, is the sum of the thermal energies of all plasma species: electrons (e), deuterium ions (D), and tritium ions (T).\n$$W_{th} = W_{e} + W_{D} + W_{T}$$\nUnder the ideal-gas assumption for a monatomic species, the thermal energy density is given by $W_s = \\frac{3}{2} n_s T_s$, where $n_s$ and $T_s$ are the number density and temperature of species $s$.\n\nThe plasma is specified as quasineutral and composed of D-T. For a 50-50 D-T mixture, the ion densities are equal: $n_D = n_T$. Quasineutrality requires that the electron charge density equals the total positive ion charge density: $n_e |e| = n_D |Z_D e| + n_T |Z_T e|$. Since deuterium and tritium are isotopes of hydrogen, their charge numbers are $Z_D = Z_T = 1$. This leads to $n_e = n_D + n_T$. Combining these, we find $n_D = n_T = n_e / 2$. The total ion density is $n_i = n_D + n_T = n_e$. The problem gives a single number density $n$, which by convention in this context is the electron density, so we set $n \\equiv n_e = 10^{20}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$.\n\nThe problem also states that electron and ion temperatures are equal, so $T_e = T_i = T$.
