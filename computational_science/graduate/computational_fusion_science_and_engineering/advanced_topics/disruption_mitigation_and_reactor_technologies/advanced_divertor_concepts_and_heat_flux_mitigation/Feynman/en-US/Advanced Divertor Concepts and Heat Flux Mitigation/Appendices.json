            "problem": "A medium-size tokamak operates in an attached divertor regime where the divertor target heat-flux profile is well described by an exponential fall-off mapped to the outboard midplane scrape-off layer (SOL) width. Following the Eich scaling, the SOL heat-flux width scales inversely with the edge poloidal magnetic field, so that $\\lambda_q = \\alpha/B_p$, where $\\alpha$ is a device-independent calibration constant to be determined from a baseline case. Assume a large-aspect-ratio, circular plasma so that the edge poloidal magnetic field and the edge safety factor are related by standard definitions.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in established tokamak physics, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is structured to address the four tasks presented in the problem statement in sequential order.\n\n**1) Derivation of Poloidal Magnetic Field Relations and Calibration of $\\alpha$**\n\nFirst, we relate the edge poloidal magnetic field, $B_p$, to the plasma current $I_p$ and the minor radius $a$. We start from the integral form of Ampère's law:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\mu_0 I_{\\text{enc}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space and $I_{\\text{enc}}$ is the current enclosed by the loop $\\mathcal{C}$. For a large-aspect-ratio, circular tokamak plasma, we can approximate the last closed flux surface as a circle of radius $a$. We choose this circle as our integration path $\\mathcal{C}$. The magnetic field component tangent to this path is the poloidal field $B_p$. By symmetry in this approximation, $B_p$ is constant along the path. The total enclosed current is the plasma current, $I_p$. Thus, Ampère's law simplifies to:\n$$\nB_p \\oint_{\\mathcal{C}} dl = B_p (2 \\pi a) = \\mu_0 I_p\n$$\nSolving for $B_p$ at the plasma edge (minor radius $r=a$) yields our first relation:\n$$\nB_p = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_p}{2 \\pi a}\n$$\n\nNext, we relate $B_p$ to the toroidal magnetic field $B_t$, the major radius $R$, the minor radius $a$, and the edge safety factor $q_{95}$. The safety factor $q$ is defined as the number of toroidal turns a magnetic field line makes for one poloidal turn. For a large-aspect-ratio, circular plasma, this can be approximated as the ratio of the connection lengths in the toroidal and poloidal directions:\n$$\nq \\approx \\frac{L_\\phi}{L_\\theta} = \\frac{2 \\pi R}{2 \\pi r} \\frac{B_t}{B_p} = \\frac{r B_t}{R B_p}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the minor radial coordinate. At the edge of the plasma, $r=a$, and the safety factor is denoted $q_{95}$ (or $q_a$ in this simplified model).\n$$\nq_{95} \\approx \\frac{a B_t}{R B_p}\n$$\nSolving for $B_p$ gives the second relation:\n$$\nB_p = \\frac{a B_t}{R q_{95}}\n$$\nThese two expressions for $B_p$ are physically consistent; equating them yields the standard large-aspect-ratio formula relating $q_{95}$ and $I_p$: $q_{95} \\approx \\frac{2 \\pi a^2 B_t}{\\mu_0 R I_p}$.\n\nNow, we calibrate the constant $\\alpha$ from the Eich scaling law, $\\lambda_q = \\alpha/B_p$. Using the baseline case parameters, we have $\\alpha = \\lambda_{q0} B_{p0}$. We will calculate $B_{p0}$ using the first relation, as $I_{p0}$ is provided.\nThe baseline parameters in SI units are:\n$I_{p0} = 0.53\\,\\text{MA} = 5.3 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{A}$\n$a_0 = 0.50\\,\\text{m}$\n$\\lambda_{q0} = 6.0\\,\\text{mm} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\nAnd the value of $\\mu_0$ is $4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{T}\\cdot\\text{m/A}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the edge poloidal field for the baseline case:\n$$\nB_{p0} = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_{p0}}{2 \\pi a_0} = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{T}\\cdot\\text{m/A}) (5.3 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{A})}{2 \\pi (0.50\\,\\text{m})} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-7} \\times 5.3 \\times 10^5}{0.50}\\,\\text{T} = 0.212\\,\\text{T}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the device-independent calibration constant $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\lambda_{q0} B_{p0} = (6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}) (0.212\\,\\text{T}) = 1.272 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{T}\n$$\n\n**2) Derivation of the Calibrated Analytic Expression for $\\lambda_q$**\n\nThe goal is to find an expression for $\\lambda_q$ in terms of $R$, $a$, $B_t$, and $q_{95}$. We start with the Eich scaling law, $\\lambda_q = \\alpha/B_p$, and substitute the expression for $B_p$ in terms of $q_{95}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_q = \\frac{\\alpha}{B_p} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\left(\\frac{a B_t}{R q_{95}}\\right)} = \\alpha \\frac{R q_{95}}{a B_t}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the calibrated numerical value for $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\lambda_q(R, a, B_t, q_{95}) = \\frac{(1.272 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}\\cdot\\text{T}) R q_{95}}{a B_t}\n$$\nThis is the calibrated analytic expression. When provided with $R$ and $a$ in meters and $B_t$ in tesla, this formula returns $\\lambda_q$ in meters. This is the expression required for the final answer.\n\n**3) Numerical Calculation for the Target Machine**\n\nWe now use the derived formula to calculate $\\lambda_q$ for the target machine with the following parameters:\n$R = 3.00\\,\\text{m}$\n$a = 0.90\\,\\text{m}$\n$B_t = 5.30\\,\\text{T}$\n$q_{95} = 3.50$\n\nSubstituting these values into our expression:\n$$\n\\lambda_q = \\frac{(1.272 \\times 10^{-3}) (3.00) (3.50)}{(0.90) (5.30)} \\,\\text{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_q = \\frac{0.013356}{4.77} \\,\\text{m} \\approx 2.80008 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}\n$$\nThe problem requests the answer in millimeters, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\lambda_q \\approx 2.800\\,\\text{mm}\n$$\n\n**4) Logarithmic Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nThe logarithmic sensitivity of $\\lambda_q$ to a parameter $x$ is defined as $S_x \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln \\lambda_q}{\\partial \\ln x}$.\n\nFirst, we find the sensitivity to plasma current, $S_{I_p}$. We must express $\\lambda_q$ in terms of $I_p$. Using $\\lambda_q = \\alpha/B_p$ and $B_p = \\frac{\\mu_0 I_p}{2 \\pi a}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_q = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\frac{\\mu_0 I_p}{2 \\pi a}} = \\frac{2 \\pi a \\alpha}{\\mu_0} I_p^{-1}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(\\lambda_q) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi a \\alpha}{\\mu_0}\\right) - \\ln(I_p)\n$$\nThe sensitivity is the derivative with respect to $\\ln(I_p)$:\n$$\nS_{I_p} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(\\lambda_q)}{\\partial \\ln(I_p)} = -1\n$$\nThis indicates that the SOL heat-flux width is inversely proportional to the plasma current.\n\nNext, we find the sensitivity to the edge safety factor, $S_{q_{95}}$. We use the expression derived in Task 2:\n$$\n\\lambda_q = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha R}{a B_t}\\right) q_{95}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(\\lambda_q) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\alpha R}{a B_t}\\right) + \\ln(q_{95})\n$$\nThe sensitivity is the derivative with respect to $\\ln(q_{95})$:\n$$\nS_{q_{95}} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(\\lambda_q)}{\\partial \\ln(q_{95})} = 1\n$$\nThis indicates that the SOL heat-flux width is directly proportional to the edge safety factor.\n\nRegarding the interdependence between $I_p$ and $q_{95}$: as established in Task 1, for a given device geometry ($R, a$) and toroidal field ($B_t$), these two parameters are not independent. They are related by $q_{95} \\propto 1/I_p$. This means that increasing the plasma current directly causes a decrease in the edge safety factor. The sensitivities $S_{I_p} = -1$ and $S_{q_{95}} = 1$ are perfectly consistent with this physical constraint. The apparent dependencies on $I_p$ and $q_{95}$ are two different perspectives on the same underlying physical relationship, which is ultimately tied to the strength of the poloidal magnetic field $B_p$.",

            "introduction": "Managing the intense parallel heat flux arriving at the divertor requires clever engineering of the plasma-material interface.

Let the magnetic field make an incidence angle $\\theta$ with respect to the target surface plane (so that $\\theta \\rightarrow 0$ corresponds to grazing incidence), and let the upstream and target magnetic field magnitudes be $B_{\\mathrm{u}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{t}}$, respectively.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of plasma and heat transport in a tokamak scrape-off layer, it is well-posed with sufficient information, and it is objectively formulated. We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for the heat flux density normal to the divertor target, $q_{\\perp}$, in terms of the upstream parallel heat flux density, $q_{||}$, the magnetic flux expansion factor, $f_{\\exp}$, and the magnetic field incidence angle, $\\theta$. This derivation relies on two fundamental conservation laws and a geometric projection.\n\nLet the upstream quantities in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) be denoted with a subscript 'u' and the quantities at the divertor target with a subscript 't'. The problem statement provides the upstream parallel heat flux density as $q_{||}$, so we have $q_{||,\\mathrm{u}} = q_{||}$.\n\nFirst, we consider the conservation of power flow along a magnetic flux tube. The total power, $P_{||}$, flowing parallel to the magnetic field is constant, assuming no volumetric power losses as stated in the problem. This can be expressed as the product of the parallel heat flux density and the cross-sectional area normal to the magnetic field, $A_{||}$.\n$$ P_{||} = q_{||,\\mathrm{u}} A_{||,\\mathrm{u}} = q_{||,\\mathrm{t}} A_{||,\\mathrm{t}} = \\mathrm{constant} $$\n\nSecond, we apply the principle of magnetic flux conservation along the same flux tube. The magnetic flux, $\\Phi_B$, is the product of the magnetic field magnitude, $B$, and the area normal to it, $A_{||}$.\n$$ \\Phi_B = B_{\\mathrm{u}} A_{||,\\mathrm{u}} = B_{\\mathrm{t}} A_{||,\\mathrm{t}} = \\mathrm{constant} $$\nFrom this conservation law, we can relate the cross-sectional area at the target to the upstream area:\n$$ \\frac{A_{||,\\mathrm{t}}}{A_{||,\\mathrm{u}}} = \\frac{B_{\\mathrm{u}}}{B_{\\mathrm{t}}} $$\nThe problem defines the magnetic flux expansion factor as $f_{\\exp} \\equiv B_{\\mathrm{u}}/B_{\\mathrm{t}}$. Therefore, the area of the flux tube expands by this factor as it approaches the target:\n$$ A_{||,\\mathrm{t}} = f_{\\exp} A_{||,\\mathrm{u}} $$\nThis expansion of the flux tube area affects the local parallel heat flux density at the target, $q_{||,\\mathrm{t}}$. Using the power conservation equation:\n$$ q_{||,\\mathrm{t}} = q_{||,\\mathrm{u}} \\frac{A_{||,\\mathrm{u}}}{A_{||,\\mathrm{t}}} = q_{||} \\frac{A_{||,\\mathrm{u}}}{f_{\\exp} A_{||,\\mathrm{u}}} = \\frac{q_{||}}{f_{\\exp}} $$\nThis equation shows that magnetic flux expansion directly reduces the parallel heat flux density.\n\nThird, we relate the parallel heat flux at the target, $q_{||,\\mathrm{t}}$, to the heat flux density normal to the target surface, $q_{\\perp}$. The total power $P_{||}$ arriving at the target is deposited over a \"wetted area\" on the target surface, $A_{\\mathrm{target}}$. Thus, the normal heat flux is defined as:\n$$ q_{\\perp} = \\frac{P_{||}}{A_{\\mathrm{target}}} $$\nSince $P_{||} = q_{||,\\mathrm{t}} A_{||,\\mathrm{t}}$, we can write:\n$$ q_{\\perp} = q_{||,\\mathrm{t}} \\frac{A_{||,\\mathrm{t}}}{A_{\\mathrm{target}}} $$\nThe geometric relationship between the flux tube's normal cross-section $A_{||,\\mathrm{t}}$ and its projection onto the target surface $A_{\\mathrm{target}}$ is determined by the incidence angle $\\theta$. The angle $\\theta$ is given with respect to the target surface plane. The area $A_{||,\\mathrm{t}}$ is the projection of $A_{\\mathrm{target}}$ onto the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. This geometric relation is:\n$$ A_{||,\\mathrm{t}} = A_{\\mathrm{target}} \\sin(\\theta) $$\nThis relation highlights the effect of grazing incidence: for a small angle $\\theta$, the wetted area $A_{\\mathrm{target}} = A_{||,\\mathrm{t}} / \\sin(\\theta)$ becomes significantly larger than the field-normal area $A_{||,\\mathrm{t}}$, spreading the incident power.\n\nSubstituting this geometric factor into the expression for $q_{\\perp}$:\n$$ q_{\\perp} = q_{||,\\mathrm{t}} \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{target}} \\sin(\\theta)}{A_{\\mathrm{target}}} = q_{||,\\mathrm{t}} \\sin(\\theta) $$\nFinally, we substitute our previously derived expression for $q_{||,\\mathrm{t}}$ to obtain the complete relationship:\n$$ q_{\\perp} = \\left(\\frac{q_{||}}{f_{\\exp}}\\right) \\sin(\\theta) $$\nThis expression demonstrates that the normal heat flux on the divertor target is reduced from the upstream parallel heat flux by the combined effects of magnetic flux expansion ($f_{\\exp}$ in the denominator) and grazing magnetic field incidence ($\\sin(\\theta)$ factor).\n\nNow, we use this derived formula to find the maximum allowable incidence angle, $\\theta_{\\max}$, given the material limit $q_{\\perp,\\max}$. The condition is $q_{\\perp} \\le q_{\\perp,\\max}$. The maximum angle is found at the equality:\n$$ q_{\\perp,\\max} = \\frac{q_{||}}{f_{\\exp}} \\sin(\\theta_{\\max}) $$\nSolving for $\\sin(\\theta_{\\max})$:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{\\max}) = \\frac{q_{\\perp,\\max} f_{\\exp}}{q_{||}} $$\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $q_{||} = 5.0 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n- $f_{\\exp} = 12$\n- $q_{\\perp,\\max} = 8.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_{\\max}) = \\frac{(8.0 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 12}{5.0 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{96 \\times 10^{6}}{5.0 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{9.6 \\times 10^{7}}{5.0 \\times 10^{8}} = 0.192 $$\nThe value is between $-1$ and $1$, so a real solution for $\\theta_{\\max}$ exists. To find the angle, we take the arcsin:\n$$ \\theta_{\\max} = \\arcsin(0.192) $$\nThe problem requires the answer in degrees, so we convert from radians:\n$$ \\theta_{\\max} [\\text{deg}] = \\arcsin(0.192) \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\approx 11.0753^{\\circ} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\theta_{\\max} \\approx 11.1^{\\circ} $$",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of atomic and plasma physics, specifically using a standard Collisional-Radiative (CR) model for impurity radiation. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary physical constants, functional forms for rate coefficients, and atomic data provided. The language is objective and precise, and the numerical task is clearly defined. There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The parameters given are physically plausible for the context of fusion plasma divertors. Therefore, a reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the total line radiation power density, $P_{\\rm rad}(T_e)$, for a given impurity species in a plasma as a function of electron temperature $T_e$, and to find the temperature range where this radiation is maximized.\n\nThe core of the model is a set of coupled, steady-state rate equations. We will solve these algebraically and then evaluate the resulting expressions numerically.\n\nFirst, let us define the fundamental physical constants used in the model, ensuring all calculations are performed in a consistent set of units (SI).\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_B \\approx 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{eV/K}$. This constant facilitates conversion between energy units (electron-volts, $\\text{eV}$) and temperature (Kelvin, $\\text{K}$). The temperature in Kelvin, $T_{e,K}$, is related to the temperature in electron-volts, $T_{e,eV}$, by $T_{e,K} = T_{e,eV} / k_B$.\n- Elementary charge: $e \\approx 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\text{J/eV}$. This is used to convert energy from $\\text{eV}$ to Joules ($\\text{J}$).\n- Rate coefficient constant: $C_{\\Omega} = 8.629 \\times 10^{-12} \\, \\text{m}^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{1/2}$.\n\nThe model consists of several components:\n\n1.  **Ionization-Recombination Balance:**\n    The neutral fraction of the impurity, $f_0(T_e)$, is determined by the balance between electron-impact ionization of neutral atoms (density $n_0$) and radiative recombination of singly-ionized ions (density $n_+$). The steady-state condition is:\n    $$\n    n_e n_0 S_{\\rm ion}(T_e) = n_e n_{+} \\alpha_{\\rm rec}(T_e)\n    $$\n    where $n_e$ is the electron density, $S_{\\rm ion}(T_e)$ is the ionization rate coefficient, and $\\alpha_{\\rm rec}(T_e)$ is the radiative recombination rate coefficient. With the total impurity density $n_Z = n_0 + n_{+}$, we solve for the neutral fraction $f_0(T_e) = n_0/n_Z$:\n    $$\n    f_0(T_e) = \\frac{\\alpha_{\\rm rec}(T_e)}{\\alpha_{\\rm rec}(T_e) + S_{\\rm ion}(T_e)}\n    $$\n    The rate coefficients are given as functions of $T_e$ in Kelvin:\n    $$\n    S_{\\rm ion}(T_e) = S_0 \\left(\\frac{T_e}{10^4\\,\\text{K}}\\right)^{1/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{\\rm ion}}{k_B T_e}\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\alpha_{\\rm rec}(T_e) = \\alpha_0 \\left(\\frac{T_e}{10^4\\,\\text{K}}\\right)^{-3/2}\n    $$\n    Here, $S_0$ and $\\alpha_0$ are prefactors, and $E_{\\rm ion}$ is the ionization potential of the neutral impurity. The argument of the exponential, $E_{\\rm ion} / (k_B T_e)$, is dimensionless and can be directly calculated as $E_{\\rm ion, eV} / T_{e, eV}$.\n\n2.  **Excitation-De-excitation Balance:**\n    For each spectral line, corresponding to a transition from an upper state $u$ to the ground state $g$, we assume a simplified two-level atom model. The population of the upper state is determined by a balance between electron-impact excitation from the ground state and de-population via spontaneous emission and electron-impact de-excitation. The steady-state rate equation for the upper state density $n_u$ is:\n    $$\n    n_e n_g q_{\\rm exc}(T_e) = n_u A_{ug} + n_e n_u q_{\\rm de}(T_e)\n    $$\n    Here, $n_g$ is the ground state density, $q_{\\rm exc}(T_e)$ is the excitation rate coefficient, $A_{ug}$ is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission, and $q_{\\rm de}(T_e)$ is the de-excitation rate coefficient.\n    Solving for $n_u$, we obtain:\n    $$\n    n_u(T_e) = \\frac{n_g n_e q_{\\rm exc}(T_e)}{A_{ug} + n_e q_{\\rm de}(T_e)}\n    $$\n    We make the simplifying assumption that the ground state population is approximately the total neutral population, i.e., $n_g \\approx n_0 = n_Z f_0(T_e)$.\n    The Maxwellian-averaged collisional rate coefficients are given by:\n    $$\n    q_{\\rm exc}(T_e) = C_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\Upsilon}{g_g \\sqrt{T_e}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{ug}}{k_B T_e}\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    q_{\\rm de}(T_e) = C_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\Upsilon}{g_u \\sqrt{T_e}}\n    $$\n    where $E_{ug}$ is the transition energy, $\\Upsilon$ is the effective collision strength, and $g_g, g_u$ are the statistical weights of the ground and upper states, respectively. The temperature $T_e$ in these formulae is in Kelvin.\n\n3.  **Line Radiation Power:**\n    The power radiated per unit volume (emissivity) for a single transition $u \\rightarrow g$ is the rate of spontaneous emissions per unit volume multiplied by the energy of each emitted photon:\n    $$\n    p_{ug}(T_e) = n_u(T_e) A_{ug} E_{ug, eV} e\n    $$\n    The factor $e$ converts the transition energy $E_{ug}$ from $\\text{eV}$ to Joules, so that the emissivity is in $\\text{W}/\\text{m}^3$.\n\n4.  **Total Radiation Power:**\n    The total line radiation power density, $P_{\\rm rad}(T_e)$, is the sum of the emissivities over all considered spectral lines for the impurity species:\n    $$\n    P_{\\rm rad}(T_e) = \\sum_{\\text{lines}} p_{ug}(T_e)\n    $$\n\nThe numerical procedure is as follows:\nFirst, we establish a uniform grid of electron temperatures in $\\text{eV}$, from $T_{e, \\text{min}} = 0.5\\,\\text{eV}$ to $T_{e, \\text{max}} = 100.0\\,\\text{eV}$ with a resolution of $\\Delta T_e = 0.05\\,\\text{eV}$. For each point $T_{e,eV}$ in this grid, we perform the following calculations for each test case specified:\n\n1.  Select the atomic data (for Nitrogen 'N' or Neon 'Ne') and plasma parameters ($n_e, n_Z$) for the current test case.\n2.  Convert the temperature grid from $\\text{eV}$ to Kelvin: $\\mathbf{T}_{e,K} = \\mathbf{T}_{e,eV} / k_B$.\n3.  Calculate the temperature-dependent rate coefficients $S_{\\rm ion}(\\mathbf{T}_{e,K})$ and $\\alpha_{\\rm rec}(\\mathbf{T}_{e,K})$ as arrays over the temperature grid.\n4.  Compute the neutral fraction array $\\mathbf{f}_0 = \\mathbf{\\alpha}_{\\rm rec} / (\\mathbf{\\alpha}_{\\rm rec} + \\mathbf{S}_{\\rm ion})$.\n5.  Initialize the total radiation power array $\\mathbf{P}_{\\rm rad}$ to zeros.\n6.  For each spectral line of the selected species:\n    a. Calculate the excitation and de-excitation rate coefficient arrays, $\\mathbf{q}_{\\rm exc}$ and $\\mathbf{q}_{\\rm de}$.\n    b. Calculate the upper state density array $\\mathbf{n}_u = (n_Z \\mathbf{f}_0) n_e \\mathbf{q}_{\\rm exc} / (A_{ug} + n_e \\mathbf{q}_{\\rm de})$.\n    c. Calculate the line emissivity array $\\mathbf{p}_{ug} = \\mathbf{n}_u A_{ug} E_{ug, eV} e$.\n    d. Add this contribution to the total: $\\mathbf{P}_{\\rm rad} = \\mathbf{P}_{\\rm rad} + \\mathbf{p}_{ug}$.\n7.  Once $\\mathbf{P}_{\\rm rad}$ is fully computed, find its maximum value, $P_{\\rm rad}^{\\rm max} = \\max(\\mathbf{P}_{\\rm rad})$.\n8.  Identify all temperatures $T_e$ on the grid where $P_{\\rm rad}(T_e) \\geq 0.95 \\times P_{\\rm rad}^{\\rm max}$.\n9.  If this set of temperatures is empty, find the temperature $T_{\\rm opt}$ at which $P_{\\rm rad}$ is maximum and set the result to $[T_{\\rm opt}, T_{\\rm opt}]$.\n10. Otherwise, determine the minimum ($T_{\\rm low}$) and maximum ($T_{\\rm high}$) temperatures in this set.\n11. The final result for the test case is $[T_{\\rm low}, T_{\\rm high}]$, with values rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for all four test cases, and the results are aggregated into the specified output format.",
