A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe safety factor, $q$, is a measure of the pitch of a magnetic field line in a toroidal confinement device. For a large-aspect-ratio ($R/a \\gg 1$), circular-cross-section tokamak, the safety factor at a minor radius $r$ is given by the expression:\n$$ q(r) = \\frac{r B_{t}}{R B_{p}(r)} $$\nwhere $B_{t}$ is the toroidal magnetic field (which is approximately constant across the plasma cross-section) and $B_{p}(r)$ is the poloidal magnetic field at minor radius $r$. We are asked to find the edge safety factor, $q(a)$, so we evaluate this expression at $r=a$:\n$$ q(a) = \\frac{a B_{t}}{R B_{p}(a)} $$\nTo find the poloidal magnetic field at the plasma edge, $B_{p}(a)$, we use Maxwell-Ampère's law in its integral form:\n$$ \\oint_{C} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\mu_{0} I_{enc} $$\nWe choose the integration path $C$ to be a circular loop of radius $a$ in the poloidal plane, centered on the magnetic axis. Due to the assumed axisymmetry, the magnitude of the poloidal magnetic field, $B_{p}(a)$, is constant along this path. The path length is the circumference of this circle, $2\\pi a$. The total current enclosed by this path, $I_{enc}$, is the total plasma current, $I_{p}$. Therefore, Ampère's law becomes:\n$$ B_{p}(a) (2 \\pi a) = \\mu_{0} I_{p} $$\nSolving for $B_{p}(a)$ gives:\n$$ B_{p}(a) = \\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{p}}{2 \\pi a} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $B_{p}(a)$ back into the formula for $q(a)$:\n$$ q(a) = \\frac{a B_{t}}{R \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{p}}{2 \\pi a} \\right)} $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the desired relationship for the edge safety factor:\n$$ q(a) = \\frac{2 \\pi a^{2} B_{t}}{\\mu_{0} R I_{p}} $$\nThis expression shows that for fixed geometric parameters ($a$, $R$) and toroidal field ($B_t$), the edge safety factor $q(a)$ is inversely proportional to the plasma current $I_{p}$, i.e., $q(a) \\propto I_{p}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we compute the updated numerical value of $q(a)$. The initial plasma current is $I_{p0} = 2.0\\,\\text{MA} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{A}$. During the quench, this current experiences a reduction of $35\\%$. The new plasma current, $I_{p, \\text{new}}$, is thus $65\\%$ of the initial current:\n$$ I_{p, \\text{new}} = (1 - 0.35) I_{p0} = 0.65 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{A}) = 1.3 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{A} $$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula for $q(a)$:\n- $a = 0.85\\,\\text{m}$\n- $R = 2.6\\,\\text{m}$\n- $B_{t} = 4.2\\,\\text{T}$\n- $I_{p} = I_{p, \\text{new}} = 1.3 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{A}$\n- $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{T}\\cdot\\text{m/A}$\n\n$$ q(a) = \\frac{2 \\pi (0.85)^{2} (4.2)}{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (2.6) (1.3 \\times 10^{6})} $$\nThe term $2\\pi$ in the numerator cancels with the $4\\pi$ in the denominator to leave a factor of $2$ in the denominator:\n$$ q(a) = \\frac{(0.85)^{2} (4.2)}{2 \\times 10^{-7} \\times (2.6) \\times (1.3 \\times 10^{6})} $$\n$$ q(a) = \\frac{(0.7225) (4.2)}{2 \\times 2.6 \\times 1.3 \\times 10^{-1}} = \\frac{3.0345}{0.676} \\approx 4.488905... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the updated edge safety factor is $4.489$.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether the condition $q(a) < 2$ could be reached. First, let's calculate the initial safety factor, $q_{0}(a)$, corresponding to the initial current $I_{p0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{A}$:\n$$ q_{0}(a) = \\frac{2 \\pi (0.85)^{2} (4.2)}{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (2.6) (2.0 \\times 10^{6})} = \\frac{3.0345}{1.04} \\approx 2.9177... > 2 $$\nThe initial safety factor is approximately $2.918$, which is already greater than $2$. As established by the derived expression $q(a) \\propto I_{p}^{-1}$, a *decrease* in plasma current $I_{p}$ leads to an *increase* in the edge safety factor $q(a)$. Since the current is dropping from $2.0\\,\\text{MA}$ to $1.3\\,\\text{MA}$, the value of $q(a)$ will increase from its initial value of $\\approx 2.918$ to the final value of $\\approx 4.489$. At no point during this current drop will the safety factor decrease. Therefore, the condition $q(a) < 2$ cannot be reached; the plasma state moves further away from this threshold.",

The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is directly relevant to its stated field of computational fusion science.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Peak Surface Heat Flux**\n\nThe analysis begins from the fundamental definition of heat flux. Heat flux, denoted by $q$, is defined as the rate of energy transfer ($dE/dt$) per unit area ($dA$). In general, it is a function of both position $\\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$.\n$$q(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\frac{d^3 E}{dA \\, dt}$$\nThe total energy $\\Delta W$ deposited onto a surface $S$ over all time is the integral of the heat flux over the area and time:\n$$\\Delta W = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_S q(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\, dA \\, dt$$\nThe problem instructs us to use a simplified \"top-hat\" model. This model replaces the actual spatiotemporally varying heat flux $q(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ with a constant, uniform heat flux, which we will call $q_{\\mathrm{peak}}$, over an effective area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and for an effective duration $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\nThe top-hat approximation is thus:\n$$\nq(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\approx \n\\begin{cases} \nq_{\\mathrm{peak}} & \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\text{ and } \\mathbf{x} \\in \\text{surface of area } A_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting this approximation into the energy integral, we apply the principle of conservation of energy, which states that the total deposited energy $\\Delta W$ must be conserved in the model.\n$$\\Delta W = \\int_0^{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\int_{A_{\\mathrm{eff}}} q_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\, dA \\, dt$$\nSince $q_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ is constant by the model's definition, it can be taken outside the integrals:\n$$\\Delta W = q_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\int_0^{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\left( \\int_{A_{\\mathrm{eff}}} dA \\right) dt$$\nThe integral over the area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is simply the area itself, $\\int_{A_{\\mathrm{eff}}} dA = A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The integral over time is a simple definite integral, $\\int_0^{\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}} dt = \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\nSubstituting these results back, we obtain the energy balance equation for the top-hat model:\n$$\\Delta W = q_{\\mathrm{peak}} A_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$$\nThis equation states that the total deposited energy is equal to the product of the peak (and constant) heat flux, the area over which it is applied, and the duration for which it lasts. This is the direct consequence of applying energy conservation to the simplified model.\n\nTo find the peak heat flux, we rearrange this expression:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{\\Delta W}{A_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nThis is the desired analytical expression for the peak surface heat flux based on the provided top-hat model.\n\n**Evaluation of the Peak Heat Flux**\n\nWe now evaluate the terms in this expression using the given parameters.\n\n1.  **Total Deposited Energy ($\\Delta W$)**:\n    The problem states that a fraction $\\chi$ of the initial thermal energy $W_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is deposited.\n    $$W_{\\mathrm{th}} = 3.0~\\mathrm{MJ} = 3.0 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{J}$$\n    $$\\chi = 0.60$$\n    $$\\Delta W = \\chi W_{\\mathrm{th}} = (0.60)(3.0 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{J}) = 1.8 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{J}$$\n\n2.  **Effective Deposition Area ($A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$)**:\n    The model specifies the effective area to be the area of an ellipse with semi-axes $a$ and $b$.\n    $$a = 0.25~\\mathrm{m}$$\n    $$b = 0.12~\\mathrm{m}$$\n    The area of an ellipse is given by $A = \\pi ab$.\n    $$A_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\pi a b = \\pi (0.25~\\mathrm{m})(0.12~\\mathrm{m}) = 0.030 \\pi~\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n\n3.  **Effective Pulse Duration ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}}$)**:\n    The model specifies the effective duration to be equal to the FWHM of the temporal pulse.\n    $$\\tau_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = 2.5~\\mathrm{ms} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{s}$$\n    $$\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{FWHM}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for $q_{\\mathrm{peak}}$:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^6~\\mathrm{J}}{(0.030 \\pi~\\mathrm{m}^2)(2.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{s})}$$\nWe can simplify the denominator first:\n$$(0.030)(2.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = 0.075 \\times 10^{-3} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-5}$$\nSo,\n$$q_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^6}{7.5 \\pi \\times 10^{-5}}~\\frac{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathrm{m}^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{s}}$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{J/s}$ is a Watt ($\\mathrm{W}$), so the unit of heat flux is $\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n$$q_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{1.8}{7.5 \\pi} \\times 10^{11}~\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2} = \\frac{180}{7.5 \\pi} \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nSince $180 / 7.5 = 24$, we have:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{24}{\\pi} \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in gigawatts per square meter ($\\mathrm{GW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$). Since $1~\\mathrm{GW} = 10^9~\\mathrm{W}$, the expression becomes:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{24}{\\pi}~\\mathrm{GW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to three significant figures:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx \\frac{24}{3.14159...} \\approx 7.639437...~\\mathrm{GW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$q_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 7.64~\\mathrm{GW}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\n\n**Additional Simplifying Assumptions Used**\nThe solution relies on the simplifying assumptions explicitly stated in the problem's \"top-hat\" model. Outside of those, we implicitly assume:\n1.  All deposited energy $\\Delta W$ manifests as a surface heat load. No other energy loss or conversion mechanisms (e.g., immediate re-radiation from the divertor surface, kinetic energy of sputtered particles) are considered in this energy balance.\n2.  The diagnostic measurements ($\\chi$, FWHM, $a$, $b$) are exact for the purpose of this calculation.\n3.  The use of $A_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\pi ab$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{FWHM}}$ are conservative engineering approximations, as instructed. More detailed models relating Gaussian profiles to equivalent top-hat profiles would yield slightly different effective areas and durations, but the problem statement mandates this specific, simpler choice.",

This condition is met.\n\n2.  **Injection Rate:**\n    The required average injection rate is $R_{\\mathrm{req}} = N_{z}^{\\mathrm{inj}} / \\tau_{\\mathrm{inj}} = (1.50 \\times 10^{20}) / (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}) = 5.00 \\times 10^{22}$ atoms/s.\n    We check this against the maximum rate: $R_{\\mathrm{req}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{22} \\leq R_{\\max} = 5.00 \\times 10^{22}$. This condition is also met.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the scenario is feasible with the given actuator.",
