There is free magnetic energy available to be released through magnetic reconnection. In the linear phase of resistive MHD, this instability leads to the exponential growth of the tearing perturbation, which nonlinearly evolves into a magnetic island chain at the rational surface $x=0$.

Substituting this into our evolving equation gives:\n$$\n\\eta \\left( \\nabla \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} \\right) \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nSince $\\mu_0$ is a constant, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nWe now employ the vector calculus identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$. Applying this to $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\left( \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nFrom another of Maxwell's equations, we know that the magnetic field is divergenceless, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$. The equation thus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} (-\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}) = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the magnetic diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is a standard diffusion equation of the form $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 f$, where $D = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0}$ is the magnetic diffusivity. The characteristic time $\\tau$ for a diffusion process to occur over a characteristic length scale $L$ is given by dimensional analysis as $\\tau \\sim \\frac{L^2}{D}$. In our case, the characteristic length scale for the plasma is its minor radius $a$. Therefore, the characteristic resistive diffusion timescale, denoted $\\tau_R$, is:\n$$\n\\tau_R = \\frac{a^2}{D} = \\frac{\\mu_0 a^2}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis timescale governs the relaxation of both magnetic fields and, by extension, electrical currents within the plasma.\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical value of $\\tau_R$ using the provided data:\n- Minor radius $a = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Resistivity $\\eta = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Vacuum permeability $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\tau_R = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (0.6\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_R = \\frac{4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\times 0.36}{5 \\times 10^{-5}}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_R = \\frac{1.44\\pi}{5} \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_R \\approx 0.288 \\times 3.14159265... \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.904778...\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_R \\approx 0.00904778...\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the timescale is $0.009048\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFinally, we explain the conceptual significance of this timescale. The current quench (CQ) in a tokamak disruption is the process where the plasma current rapidly decays. The resistive diffusion timescale $\\tau_R$ represents the \"natural\" timescale over which this current decay would occur if it were governed solely by the plasma's resistivity.\nIt serves as a crucial benchmark to classify the severity of a current quench:\n- **Slow Current Quench**: If the observed duration of the current quench, $\\Delta t_{CQ}$, is on the order of or longer than the resistive timescale ($\\Delta t_{CQ} \\gtrsim \\tau_R$), the event is considered a slow quench. In this scenario, the current profile relaxation is limited by resistive diffusion, and the plasma can evolve through a series of quasi-equilibria. While still undesirable, this is a less violent scenario.\n- **Fast Current Quench**: If the observed duration is much shorter than the resistive timescale ($\\Delta t_{CQ} \\ll \\tau_R$), the event is a fast quench. This implies that a process much faster than classical resistive diffusion is dominating the current decay. This is typically due to the rapid onset of large-scale MHD instabilities, leading to magnetic field line stochasticity and rapid loss of thermal energy and current-carrying electrons to the vessel walls. These fast quenches induce much larger electromagnetic forces on the tokamak structure and are significantly more dangerous.\n\nThus, comparing the measured $\\Delta t_{CQ}$ to the calculated $\\tau_R$ is a primary diagnostic for understanding the underlying physics and severity of a disruptive event.",
