However, fusion requires overcoming the immense electrostatic repulsion between nuclei, a feat that becomes more probable at higher energies. This practice explores the fascinating interplay between these two competing factors: the decreasing population of high-energy ions and their increasing probability of quantum tunneling through the Coulomb barrier.

            "problem": "A deuterium–tritium (D–T) fusion plasma with ion temperature $T_i$ produces neutrons primarily through the reaction of deuterons with tritons. For two ion species at equal temperature, the distribution of relative kinetic energy $E$ is Maxwell–Boltzmann, and the reaction cross-section contains the quantum tunneling probability across the Coulomb barrier, characterized by the Sommerfeld parameter $\\eta = Z_1 Z_2 e^2 / (\\hbar v)$, where $v$ is the center-of-mass relative speed and $E = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mu v^2$ with reduced mass $\\mu$.

The formulation is based on fundamental principles of statistical mechanics (Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution) and quantum mechanics (tunneling through the Coulomb barrier). The given data and constants are accurate and physically realistic. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing a clear path to a unique solution. The simplifying assumption to focus on the exponential factors is a standard and valid approximation for deriving the Gamow peak energy. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Gamow Peak Energy $E_0$\nThe reaction rate for a thermonuclear process is proportional to the integral of the product of the particle energy distribution and the reaction cross-section over all energies. The integrand, which represents the reaction rate per unit energy, is a product of several terms. The problem instructs us to focus on the two dominant, competing exponential factors:\n1.  The Maxwell–Boltzmann factor, which gives the probability of finding a particle pair with a given relative energy $E$. This factor decreases exponentially with energy: $P_{MB}(E) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i}\\right)$.\n2.  The tunneling factor, which gives the probability of the two nuclei overcoming or tunneling through their mutual electrostatic repulsion (the Coulomb barrier). This factor increases exponentially with energy. It is given as $\\exp(-2\\pi\\eta)$.\n\nThe task is to find the energy $E_0$ that maximizes the product of these two factors. Let this product be denoted by $F(E)$:\n$$F(E) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i}\\right) \\exp(-2\\pi\\eta)$$\nTo proceed, we must express the Sommerfeld parameter $\\eta$ as a function of the relative kinetic energy $E$. We are given:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{\\hbar v} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad E = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu v^2$$\nFrom the second equation, the relative speed is $v = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{\\mu}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{\\hbar \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{\\mu}}} = \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2 \\sqrt{\\mu}}{\\hbar\\sqrt{2}} E^{-1/2}$$\nThe tunneling term exponent is then:\n$$-2\\pi\\eta = -2\\pi \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2 \\sqrt{\\mu}}{\\hbar\\sqrt{2}} E^{-1/2} = -\\left(\\pi Z_1 Z_2 e^2 \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu}{\\hbar^2}}\\right) E^{-1/2}$$\nLet us define a characteristic energy, the Gamow energy $E_G$, to simplify this expression. We use the relation $e^2 = \\alpha\\hbar c$ (in Heaviside-Lorentz or Gaussian units context, this is $\\alpha\\hbar c$ where $e^2$ is more formally $e^2/4\\pi\\epsilon_0$). The exponent becomes:\n$$-2\\pi\\eta = -2\\pi \\frac{Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha \\hbar c}{\\hbar v} = -2\\pi Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha \\frac{c}{v} = -2\\pi Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha c \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{2E}} = -\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\pi Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha)^2 (2\\mu c^2)}{E}}$$\nWe define the Gamow energy $E_G$ as:\n$$E_G = (\\pi Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha)^2 (2\\mu c^2)$$\nThe tunneling factor exponent is thus simply $-\\sqrt{E_G/E}$.\n\nThe function to be maximized becomes:\n$$F(E) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i} - \\sqrt{\\frac{E_G}{E}}\\right)$$\nTo maximize $F(E)$, we can maximize its argument, which is the exponent. Let $g(E) = -E/(k_B T_i) - \\sqrt{E_G} E^{-1/2}$. We find the maximum by setting the derivative with respect to $E$ to zero:\n$$\\frac{dg}{dE} = \\frac{d}{dE}\\left(-\\frac{E}{k_B T_i} - \\sqrt{E_G} E^{-1/2}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{k_B T_i} - \\sqrt{E_G}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} E^{-3/2}\\right) = 0$$\nLet $E_0$ be the energy at which this maximum occurs.\n$$-\\frac{1}{k_B T_i} + \\frac{\\sqrt{E_G}}{2} E_0^{-3/2} = 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{E_G}}{2} E_0^{-3/2} = \\frac{1}{k_B T_i}$$\nSolving for $E_0$:\n$$E_0^{3/2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E_G} (k_B T_i)}{2}$$\n$$E_0 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{E_G} (k_B T_i)}{2}\\right)^{2/3} = \\left(\\frac{E_G (k_B T_i)^2}{4}\\right)^{1/3}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the Gamow peak energy $E_0$.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation for D–T Plasma\nWe now evaluate $E_0$ for the given D–T plasma parameters.\n\n1.  **Reduced mass energy, $\\mu c^2$**:\n    The reduced mass $\\mu$ for the D-T system is $\\mu = \\frac{m_D m_T}{m_D + m_T}$.\n    $$\\mu = \\frac{(2.01410178\\,u)(3.01604928\\,u)}{2.01410178\\,u + 3.01604928\\,u} = \\frac{6.07474503}{5.03015106}\\,u = 1.20766436\\,u$$\n    The energy equivalent is:\n    $$\\mu c^2 = 1.20766436 \\times 931.494102\\,\\mathrm{MeV} = 1124.9083\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$$\n\n2.  **Gamow energy, $E_G$**: For D–T, $Z_1=1$ and $Z_2=1$.\n    $$E_G = (\\pi \\alpha)^2 (2\\mu c^2)$$\n    Using $\\alpha = 1/137.035999084$:\n    $$\\pi \\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{137.035999084} \\approx 0.02292406$$\n    $$(\\pi \\alpha)^2 \\approx 5.25511 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n    $$E_G = (5.25511 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (2 \\times 1124.9083\\,\\mathrm{MeV}) = (5.25511 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (2249.8166\\,\\mathrm{MeV})$$\n    $$E_G \\approx 1.18231\\,\\mathrm{MeV} = 1182.31\\,\\mathrm{keV}$$\n\n3.  **Gamow peak energy, $E_0$**:\n    We are given $k_B T_i = 10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n    $$E_0 = \\left(\\frac{E_G (k_B T_i)^2}{4}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{(1182.31\\,\\mathrm{keV}) (10\\,\\mathrm{keV})^2}{4}\\right)^{1/3}$$\n    $$E_0 = \\left(\\frac{118231}{4}\\right)^{1/3}\\,\\mathrm{keV} = (29557.75)^{1/3}\\,\\mathrm{keV}$$\n    $$E_0 \\approx 30.92055\\,\\mathrm{keV}$$\n\n### Calculation of the Ratio $R$\nThe problem defines the ratio $R = E_{\\sigma,\\max}/E_0$. We are given $E_{\\sigma,\\max} = 64\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n$$R = \\frac{64\\,\\mathrm{keV}}{30.92055\\,\\mathrm{keV}} \\approx 2.07005$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $R = 2.07$.\n\n### Qualitative Discussion\nThe Gamow peak energy, $E_0 \\approx 30.9\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, represents the most effective energy for fusion reactions in a D-T plasma at an ion temperature of $10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. This energy is substantially higher than the average kinetic energy of the ions, which is $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T_i = 15\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. This demonstrates that fusion reactions are predominantly initiated by ions in the high-energy tail of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\n\nThe energy at which the fusion cross-section itself is maximal is $E_{\\sigma,\\max} = 64\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. This is the optimal energy for a single collision event. However, in the thermal plasma, the population of ions at this high energy is extremely small, suppressed by a factor of $\\exp(-E/k_B T_i) = \\exp(-64/10) = \\exp(-6.4) \\approx 1.7 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nThe fact that $E_0$ is significantly smaller than $E_{\\sigma,\\max}$ (as shown by $R \\approx 2.07 > 1$) is a crucial insight. It signifies that the overall reaction rate is not dominated by reactions at the peak of the cross-section. Instead, the effective reacting energy range is a compromise, pushed to lower energies (relative to $E_{\\sigma,\\max}$) by the rapidly decreasing number of available reactants as energy increases. The majority of fusion events occur in an energy window around $E_0$, which lies on the steeply rising part of the cross-section curve, far below its maximum. The Gamow peak $E_0$ thus represents the balance between the increasing reaction probability (tunneling) and the decreasing particle population (Maxwellian tail) with increasing energy.",

Starting from the radial Schrödinger equation and Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) tunneling through a purely Coulomb barrier $\\displaystyle V(r)=\\frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{r}$ for charges $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, and using the concept of the astrophysical $S$-factor, reason about barrier penetration and short-range nuclear matrix elements to compare $\\sigma(E)$ for $D$–$T$ and $D$–$D$ at the same $E$.\n\nAssume the following physically relevant data: $Z_D=Z_T=1$, $m_D \\approx 2\\,u$, $m_T \\approx 3\\,u$, where $u$ is the unified atomic mass unit with $u c^2 \\approx 931.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, and the fine-structure constant is $\\alpha \\approx 1/137$.

Because $Z_1 Z_2$ is identical for $D$–$T$ and $D$–$D$, the Coulomb barrier is the same in form; the reduced mass difference makes $D$–$T$ slightly less penetrable at a given $E$ (a factor $\\mathcal{O}(1)$, e.g., $\\sim 0.7$ at $E=100\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), so the observed orders-of-magnitude enhancement in $\\sigma_{DT}(E)$ must arise primarily from a much larger astrophysical $S$-factor (short-range nuclear matrix element) for $D$–$T$, associated with strong $s$-wave compound-nucleus formation in ${}^{5}\\mathrm{He}$ near threshold, whereas $D$–$D$ channels are suppressed by spin–isospin and partial-wave constraints.\n\nB. The identical $Z_1 Z_2$ implies the same Coulomb barrier shape, but the reduced mass difference alone exponentially enhances $D$–$T$ barrier penetration by $10^2$–$10^3$ at $E=100\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, so nuclear matrix elements ($S$-factors) for $D$–$T$ and $D$–$D$ are comparable and do not explain the disparity.\n\nC.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a physical explanation of the experimentally observed fact that the fusion cross section for the deuterium–tritium ($D$–$T$) reaction is orders of magnitude larger than that for the deuterium–deuterium ($D$–$D$) reaction at the same center-of-mass energy $E$ in the range relevant for thermonuclear fusion ($E \\sim 10-100$s of keV). The explanation must be derived from the principles of quantum mechanical tunneling and the concept of the astrophysical $S$-factor.\n\nThe cross section $\\sigma(E)$ for a non-resonant nuclear reaction between two charged particles at low energy ($E$) is conventionally parameterized as:\n$$ \\sigma(E) = \\frac{S(E)}{E} P(E) $$\nwhere $E$ is the center-of-mass energy, $S(E)$ is the astrophysical $S$-factor which contains the details of the short-range nuclear physics, and $P(E)$ is the probability of penetrating the Coulomb barrier. The $1/E$ factor arises from the quantum mechanical nature of the cross section, which scales as the square of the de Broglie wavelength ($\\pi\\lambda^2 \\propto 1/p^2 \\propto 1/E$).\n\nThe barrier penetration probability $P(E)$ is estimated using the WKB approximation, giving:\n$$ P(E) \\approx \\exp(-2\\gamma) $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the Gamow factor.

Comparison of Barrier Penetration Factors**\n\nThe barrier penetration factor depends on two quantities: the product of charges $Z_1 Z_2$ and the reduced mass $\\mu$.\n\n*   **Product of Charges ($Z_1 Z_2$)**:\n    *   For the $D$–$T$ reaction ($D+T \\rightarrow n+\\alpha$): The deuteron ($D$) has charge $Z_D=1$ and the triton ($T$) has charge $Z_T=1$. Thus, $Z_1 Z_2 = (1)(1) = 1$.\n    *   For the $D$–$D$ reaction ($D+D \\rightarrow n+^3\\mathrm{He}$): Both nuclei are deuterons with charge $Z_D=1$. Thus, $Z_1 Z_2 = (1)(1) = 1$.\n    Since $Z_1 Z_2$ is identical for both reactions, the shape and height of the Coulomb potential $V(r)$ are identical.\n\n*   **Reduced Mass ($\\mu$)**:\n    *   For the $D$–$T$ reaction, using the given approximations $m_D \\approx 2\\,u$ and $m_T \\approx 3\\,u$:\n        $$ \\mu_{DT} = \\frac{m_D m_T}{m_D + m_T} \\approx \\frac{(2\\,u)(3\\,u)}{2\\,u + 3\\,u} = \\frac{6}{5}u = 1.2\\,u $$\n    *   For the $D$–$D$ reaction:\n        $$ \\mu_{DD} = \\frac{m_D m_D}{m_D + m_D} = \\frac{m_D}{2} \\approx \\frac{2\\,u}{2} = 1.0\\,u $$\n    The reduced mass for the $D$–$T$ system is larger than for the $D$–$D$ system: $\\mu_{DT} > \\mu_{DD}$.\n\nThe exponent in the penetration factor is proportional to $\\sqrt{\\mu}$. Therefore, a larger reduced mass leads to a larger negative exponent, which in turn leads to a *smaller* penetration probability. Let's quantify this effect at the representative energy $E = 100\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n\nThe ratio of the penetration probabilities is:\n$$ \\frac{P_{DT}(E)}{P_{DD}(E)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\pi Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha \\sqrt{2\\mu_{DT}c^2/E}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\pi Z_1 Z_2 \\alpha \\sqrt{2\\mu_{DD}c^2/E}\\right)} = \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\pi \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{2c^2}{E}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\mu_{DT}} - \\sqrt{\\mu_{DD}}\\right)\\right] $$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$ \\frac{P_{DT}(E)}{P_{DD}(E)} = \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\pi \\alpha \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\mu_{DD}c^2}{E}}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_{DT}}{\\mu_{DD}}} - 1\\right)\\right] $$\nThe term in the first parenthesis is the argument of the exponent for the $D$–$D$ reaction.

This is a factor of order one ($\\mathcal{O}(1)$) and it acts in the opposite direction to the observed cross-section enhancement.\n\n**2. Comparison of Astrophysical S-factors**\n\nThe ratio of the total cross sections is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{DT}(E)}{\\sigma_{DD}(E)} = \\frac{S_{DT}(E)}{S_{DD}(E)} \\times \\frac{P_{DT}(E)}{P_{DD}(E)} \\approx \\frac{S_{DT}(E)}{S_{DD}(E)} \\times 0.742 $$\nSince experiments show $\\sigma_{DT}(E) \\gg \\sigma_{DD}(E)$ by orders of magnitude (typically a factor of $\\sim 100$ in this energy range), it must be that the ratio of the $S$-factors is very large:\n$$ \\frac{S_{DT}(E)}{S_{DD}(E)} \\gg 1 $$\nSpecifically, if $\\sigma_{DT}/\\sigma_{DD} \\approx 100$, then $S_{DT}/S_{DD} \\approx 100 / 0.742 \\approx 135$.\nThe huge difference in cross sections must therefore originate from the short-range nuclear physics encapsulated in the $S$-factor.\n\nThe physical reason for this large difference in $S$-factors lies in the structure of the compound nuclei formed.\n*   The $D$–$T$ reaction proceeds via an intermediate compound nucleus, ${}^5\\mathrm{He}^*$. This nucleus has a broad, unbound $J^\\pi = 3/2^+$ state that lies only about $107\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ above the $D+T$ separation energy. This state can be formed by $s$-wave ($L=0$) interaction of the deuteron and triton. This near-threshold resonance dramatically enhances the probability of fusion once the nuclei get close, leading to a very large $S$-factor, $S_{DT}(E) \\approx 12-14\\,\\mathrm{MeV} \\cdot \\mathrm{barn}$.\n*   The $D$–$D$ reactions proceed via the compound nucleus ${}^4\\mathrm{He}^*$. The reacting nuclei are two identical bosons (deuterons, spin $S_D=1$), so their total wavefunction must be symmetric under exchange. This imposes strong selection rules. For an $s$-wave collision ($L=0$, spatially symmetric), the total spin state must also be symmetric ($S=0$ or $S=2$). However, the available exit channels ($n+^3\\mathrm{He}$ and $p+T$) are not strongly coupled to these initial states due to spin, parity, and isospin conservation rules. Consequently, the $s$-wave contribution to the $D$–$D$ reaction is heavily suppressed, and the reactions proceed mainly through higher partial waves (e.g., $p$-waves, $L=1$), which are less probable at low energies. This results in a much smaller $S$-factor, $S_{DD}(E) \\approx 0.05-0.06 \\,\\mathrm{MeV} \\cdot \\mathrm{barn}$ for each branch.\n\nThe ratio of the $S$-factors is therefore $S_{DT}/S_{DD} \\approx (13\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\cdot\\mathrm{b}) / (0.055\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\\cdot\\mathrm{b}) \\approx 236$, which is indeed a very large number, consistent with our analysis.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A**: This option correctly states that: (1) the Coulomb barrier form is the same as $Z_1 Z_2=1$ for both; (2) the reduced mass difference makes $D$–$T$ tunneling slightly harder, giving a suppression factor of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ ($\\sim 0.7$ at $100\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), consistent with our calculation; (3) the large enhancement in $\\sigma_{DT}$ must therefore come from a much larger $S$-factor for $D$–$T$; (4) this is correctly attributed to the strong $s$-wave resonance in the ${}^5\\mathrm{He}$ compound nucleus, contrasted with suppressed channels for $D$–$D$. This analysis is entirely correct and complete. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B**: This option claims the reduced mass difference *enhances* $D$–$T$ barrier penetration by $10^2$–$10^3$. This is incorrect. A larger reduced mass impedes tunneling, as shown by the WKB formula where $\\mu$ is in the argument of a negative exponential. It also incorrectly concludes that the $S$-factors are comparable. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C**: This option claims the $D$–$D$ reaction has a larger Coulomb barrier. This is incorrect. The Coulomb potential $V(r) \\propto Z_1 Z_2/r$ is the same for both since $Z_1 Z_2 = 1$ in both cases. Quantum statistical effects for identical particles affect the allowed partial waves (and thus the $S$-factor), not the classical potential barrier. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D**: This option invokes plasma and screening effects, which are explicitly forbidden by the problem statement (\"No... electron screening, or plasma collective effects are to be invoked\"). Furthermore, these effects, while present in a real plasma, are not the primary cause of the orders-of-magnitude difference between the two reactions. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E**: This option contains two fundamental errors. First, it states that tritium has charge $Z_T=2$, while it is an isotope of hydrogen with charge $Z_T=1$. Second, it claims the cross sections are similar, which contradicts the premise of the problem. **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, option A provides the only valid and comprehensive physical explanation.",

The concept of macroscopic and microscopic cross sections is fundamental to reactor physics. The specified D-T fusion reaction yielding a $14.1\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ neutron is correct. The densities for the plasma and structural material are physically realistic for a fusion reactor concept. The microscopic cross-section values are of a plausible order of magnitude for MeV-range neutrons. The instruction to neglect neutron-electron interactions is a standard and valid simplification, as the cross section for this process is orders of magnitude smaller than for neutron-nucleus interactions.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to compute the requested ratio. The required formula for a mixture's macroscopic cross section is a standard principle (Bragg's additivity rule). A unique solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary data for a unique solution are provided. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe macroscopic total cross section, $\\Sigma_t$, represents the probability of a neutron interaction per unit path length in a medium. For a single species of target with number density $n$ and microscopic cross section $\\sigma_t$, it is defined as:\n$$\n\\Sigma_t = n \\sigma_t\n$$\nFor a homogeneous mixture of multiple species, the total macroscopic cross section is the sum of the individual macroscopic cross sections of each constituent species. This is because the probabilities of interaction with each species are additive.\n\nFirst, we calculate the macroscopic total cross section for the D-T plasma, $\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{plasma}}$. The plasma is a mixture of deuterium and tritium ions. The problem specifies to neglect electrons. Therefore, applying the additivity principle:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{plasma}} = \\Sigma_{t,D} + \\Sigma_{t,T}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition for each species:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{plasma}} = n_D \\sigma_{t,D} + n_T \\sigma_{t,T}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the macroscopic total cross section for the structural material (RAFM steel), $\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{struct}}$. The steel is treated as a homogeneous material with a given effective atomic number density $n_s$ and an effective per-atom microscopic cross section $\\sigma_{t,s}$.\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{struct}} = n_s \\sigma_{t,s}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{plasma}}}{\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{struct}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for the macroscopic cross sections:\n$$\nR = \\frac{n_D \\sigma_{t,D} + n_T \\sigma_{t,T}}{n_s \\sigma_{t,s}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values. Note that since we are calculating a ratio, the units of the microscopic cross section (barns) will cancel, as will the units of number density ($\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$), provided we are consistent.\nGiven values are:\n$n_D = 5.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$n_T = 5.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$\\sigma_{t,D} = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{barn}$\n$\\sigma_{t,T} = 2.4\\,\\mathrm{barn}$\n$n_s = 8.0 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$\\sigma_{t,s} = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{barn}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator, $\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{plasma}}$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{plasma}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(1.7\\,\\mathrm{barn}) + (5.0 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(2.4\\,\\mathrm{barn})\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{plasma}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{19}) \\times (1.7 + 2.4)\\,\\mathrm{barn} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{plasma}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{19}) \\times (4.1)\\,\\mathrm{barn} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{plasma}} = 20.5 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{barn} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 2.05 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{barn} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nNext, calculate the denominator, $\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{struct}}$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{struct}} = (8.0 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(3.5\\,\\mathrm{barn})\n$$\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,\\mathrm{struct}} = 28.0 \\times 10^{28}\\,\\mathrm{barn} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 2.8 \\times 10^{29}\\,\\mathrm{barn} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nFinally, compute the ratio R:\n$$\nR = \\frac{2.05 \\times 10^{20}}{2.8 \\times 10^{29}}\n$$\n$$\nR = \\frac{2.05}{2.8} \\times 10^{20 - 29} = \\frac{2.05}{2.8} \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx 0.732142857... \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx 7.32142857... \\times 10^{-10}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 7.32 \\times 10^{-10}\n$$\nThis result signifies that the plasma is extremely transparent to the $14.1\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ neutrons compared to the solid structural wall, which is expected given the vast difference in number densities between the rarefied plasma and the solid steel (a factor of about $10^9$). The mean free path of a neutron in the plasma is correspondingly about $10^9$ times longer than in the steel.",
