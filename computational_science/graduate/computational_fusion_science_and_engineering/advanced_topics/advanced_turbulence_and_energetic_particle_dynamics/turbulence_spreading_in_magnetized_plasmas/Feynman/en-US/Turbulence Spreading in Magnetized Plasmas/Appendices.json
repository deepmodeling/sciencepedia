The model for turbulence intensity $I(r,t)$ is the reaction-diffusion equation: $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t} = D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2} I}{\\partial r^{2}} + \\gamma\\,I - \\beta\\,I^{2}$.\n2.  $D > 0$ is a constant turbulent diffusivity.\n3.  $\\gamma > 0$ is a constant local linear growth rate.\n4.  $\\beta > 0$ represents nonlinear saturation.\n5.  The initial condition $I(r,0)$ is a \"localized, sufficiently steep profile\".\n6.  Boundary conditions for the traveling front are $I \\to 0$ as $r \\to +\\infty$ and $I \\to I_{\\text{sat}}=\\gamma/\\beta$ as $r \\to -\\infty$.\n7.  The analysis should focus on the leading edge of the front, characterized by diffusive transport and linear growth.\n\nValidation:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The governing equation is a well-known model in mathematical physics, the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP) equation, which is widely used as a simplified model for front propagation in various fields, including population dynamics and plasma physics. The parameters $D$, $\\gamma$, and $\\beta$ have clear physical interpretations within the context of turbulence modeling. The problem is well-posed, with specified boundary conditions and a characterization of the initial condition that leads to a unique, selected front speed. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nDerivation of the Front Speed:\nWe seek a traveling wave solution of the form $I(r,t) = f(\\xi)$, where $\\xi = r - v t$ is the coordinate in the moving frame and $v$ is the constant speed of the front. Substituting this ansatz into the governing partial differential equation gives an ordinary differential equation for the front profile $f(\\xi)$:\n$$\n-v \\frac{df}{d\\xi} = D \\frac{d^2 f}{d\\xi^2} + \\gamma f - \\beta f^2\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nD f''(\\xi) + v f'(\\xi) + \\gamma f(\\xi) - \\beta f(\\xi)^2 = 0\n$$\nThe boundary conditions in the moving frame are $f(\\xi) \\to I_{\\text{sat}} = \\gamma/\\beta$ as $\\xi \\to -\\infty$ (behind the front) and $f(\\xi) \\to 0$ as $\\xi \\to +\\infty$ (ahead of the front). The problem directs us to analyze the leading edge of the front, where $\\xi \\to +\\infty$ and the intensity $I$ is very small. In this limit, the nonlinear saturation term $-\\beta f^2$ is negligible compared to the linear growth term $\\gamma f$. The equation linearizes to:\n$$\nD f''(\\xi) + v f'(\\xi) + \\gamma f(\\xi) = 0\n$$\nWe look for exponential solutions of the form $f(\\xi) \\propto \\exp(\\lambda \\xi)$. Substituting this into the linearized ODE yields the characteristic equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\nD \\lambda^2 + v \\lambda + \\gamma = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\frac{-v \\pm \\sqrt{v^2 - 4D\\gamma}}{2D}\n$$\nFor the front profile to decay to zero as $\\xi \\to +\\infty$, the real part of $\\lambda$ must be negative. Also, for a physically realistic intensity profile that is non-negative ($I \\ge 0$), the tail of the front cannot be oscillatory, as this would imply negative values of $I$. Oscillatory solutions arise when the roots $\\lambda_{\\pm}$ are complex, which occurs if the discriminant is negative ($v^2 - 4D\\gamma < 0$). Therefore, we must require real roots, which imposes the condition:\n$$\nv^2 - 4D\\gamma \\ge 0 \\implies v^2 \\ge 4D\\gamma\n$$\nAssuming the front propagates in the positive $r$ direction ($v>0$), this establishes a continuum of allowed speeds $v \\ge 2\\sqrt{D\\gamma}$. All such speeds correspond to physically valid traveling wave solutions.\n\nThe specific speed that is selected depends on the initial condition. The problem states that the initial profile $I(r,0)$ is \"sufficiently steep\". For the FKPP equation, it is a classic result (marginal stability criterion) that steep initial conditions (those that decay faster than the slowest possible exponential tail of a traveling front) lead to the selection of the minimum possible speed. Such fronts are called \"pulled fronts\" because their dynamics are dictated by the linear behavior at the very leading edge. The minimum speed in the allowed continuum is:\n$$\nv_{\\text{min}} = 2\\sqrt{D\\gamma}\n$$\nThis is the asymptotic speed of the pulled front selected by steep initial conditions.\n\nPhysical Discussion:\nThe derivation of the front speed $v = 2\\sqrt{D\\gamma}$ relies on several key assumptions inherent in the model:\n1.  **Reaction-Diffusion Model:** The complex physics of turbulence spreading is coarse-grained into a simple diffusive flux ($-D\\,\\partial_r I$) and a local net growth term ($\\gamma I - \\beta I^2$).\n2.  **Homogeneity:** The coefficients $D$, $\\gamma$, and $\\beta$ are assumed constant. This implies that the underlying plasma properties (e.g., temperature and density gradients that drive the instability) are uniform in space, which is a strong idealization for a fusion plasma.\n3.  **Locality:** The model is local in space. The flux at a point $r$ depends only on the gradient at $r$, and the growth/saturation depends only on the intensity $I(r)$.\n4.  **Simple Saturation:** The nonlinear saturation is modeled by a simple quadratic term, $-\\beta I^2$.\n\nIn the context of gyrokinetic turbulence spreading in computational fusion science, these assumptions have limited applicability:\n-   **Inhomogeneity:** Real tokamaks have radially varying profiles. The linear growth rate $\\gamma(r)$ is typically non-zero only in a finite radial domain. As a front propagates, it encounters changing $\\gamma$, causing its speed to vary. If it propagates into a linearly stable region ($\\gamma \\le 0$), it can slow down and stop.\n-   **Non-Locality:** Gyrokinetic turbulence is intrinsically non-local. Turbulent eddies have finite size, and large-scale, radially elongated structures known as streamers can cause rapid, \"ballistic\" or super-diffusive transport events that are much faster than predicted by a local diffusion model. The flux may be better described by an integral operator rather than a second derivative.\n-   **Complex Saturation:** The primary saturation mechanism for ion-scale turbulence is often self-generated zonal flows, which are sheared $E \\times B$ flows. This introduces a predator (zonal flow) - prey (turbulence) dynamic, which is not captured by the simple $-\\beta I^2$ term. Such dynamics can lead to the formation of \"pushed fronts\", where nonlinear effects in the front interior, not the linear leading edge, determine the speed. Pushed fronts are typically faster than the pulled front speed $2\\sqrt{D\\gamma}$.\n\nDepartures from locality (e.g., fractional diffusion) or homogeneity ($\\gamma(r)$) would fundamentally alter the analysis. Non-local transport changes the dispersion relation of the linear modes, leading to a different minimum speed. The presence of zonal flows (predator-prey dynamics) can alter the front selection mechanism itself, leading to pushed fronts whose speed is no longer given by the marginal stability analysis of the linearized equation. Therefore, while the FKPP model provides a fundamental paradigm, its direct quantitative application to realistic fusion plasma scenarios is limited, and more sophisticated models are required.",

            "solution": "The problem asks to determine which functional forms of the turbulent diffusion coefficient $D(I)$ are physically defensible based on a first-principles framework. The starting point is the Taylor-Green-Kubo (TGK) relation, which, under an exponential decorrelation assumption, gives the diffusion coefficient as the product of the mean-square velocity fluctuation and the correlation time:\n$$\nD \\approx \\langle v_{r}^{2}\\rangle\\, \\tau_{c}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the relevant velocity is the radial component of the $E \\times B$ drift, $v_{r} \\sim v_{E} \\approx (c/B)\\, |\\nabla \\phi|$.

This is the characteristic time for a turbulent eddy of size $L_{\\perp} \\sim 1/k_{\\perp}$ to be sheared apart by the turbulent velocity fluctuations themselves.

The proportionality constant $C_{A} \\sim (c/B)/k_{\\perp}$ also matches. The underlying assumption—that in a strongly turbulent regime, the decorrelation time is set by the self-interaction of the turbulence—is a standard and well-tested concept in turbulence theory. It is a cornerstone of dimensional arguments like those used in Kolmogorov's $k^{-5/3}$ theory.\n\n**Verdict**: The form $D(I) = C_{A}\\, \\sqrt{I}$ is physically justified under the standard assumption of nonlinear eddy turnover time setting the decorrelation rate in strong turbulence. **Correct**.\n\n### Evaluation of Option B\n\n**B. $D(I) = C_{B}\\, I$, with $C_{B} \\sim (c/B)^{2}/\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ under the assumption that the correlation time is controlled by a local linear decorrelation rate $\\tau_{c} \\sim \\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}^{-1}$ that is independent of amplitude.**\n\nHere, the assumption is that the correlation time is set by the inverse of the linear growth rate of the underlying instability, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}$. This rate is a property of the background plasma equilibrium (e.g., its temperature and density gradients) and is, by definition, independent of the turbulence amplitude $I$. Thus, $\\tau_{c}$ is a constant with respect to $I$:\n$$\n\\tau_{c}(I) \\sim \\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}^{-1} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our relation for $D(I)$:\n$$\nD(I) \\sim \\left(\\frac{c}{B}\\right)^{2} I\\, \\tau_{c}(I) \\sim \\left(\\frac{c}{B}\\right)^{2} I \\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}}\\right) = \\frac{(c/B)^{2}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}} I\n$$\nThis derivation yields $D(I) \\propto I$, matching the proposed functional form. The prefactor $C_{B} \\sim (c/B)^{2}/\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ also agrees. This scenario corresponds to a weak turbulence regime, where nonlinear effects are too slow to cause decorrelation, i.e., $\\tau_{\\text{nl}}^{-1} \\ll \\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}$. In this limit, the coherent structures created by the instability are disrupted on the timescale of their own linear growth. This is a well-understood and physically plausible limiting case, particularly at low turbulence amplitudes.\n\n**Verdict**: The form $D(I) = C_{B}\\, I$ is physically justified under the standard assumption of a weak turbulence regime where the linear growth rate sets the decorrelation time. **Correct**.\n\n### Evaluation of Option C\n\n**C. $D(I) = \\dfrac{C_{S}\\, I}{1+\\alpha I}$, with $C_{S} \\sim (c/B)^{2}/\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ and $\\alpha > 0$, under the assumption that $\\tau_{c} \\sim (\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{shear}})^{-1}$ and the effective zonal-flow shear rate $\\omega_{\\mathrm{shear}}$ grows proportionally to $I$.**\n\nThis option proposes a model for $\\tau_{c}$ that includes two decorrelation mechanisms: linear instability and shearing by zonal flows. A common ansatz for combining independent decorrelation rates is to sum them, so the total decorrelation rate is $\\tau_{c}^{-1} \\approx \\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{shear}}$. The key physical assumption is that the zonal flow shearing rate, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{shear}}$, is driven by the turbulence itself and grows with its intensity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{shear}} \\propto I$. Let us write this as $\\omega_{\\mathrm{shear}} = k_{ZF} I$ for some positive constant $k_{ZF}$.\n\nThe correlation time is then:\n$$\n\\tau_{c}(I) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}} + k_{ZF} I}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D(I)$:\n$$\nD(I) \\sim \\left(\\frac{c}{B}\\right)^{2} I\\, \\tau_{c}(I) \\sim \\left(\\frac{c}{B}\\right)^{2} I \\left(\\frac{1}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}} + k_{ZF} I}\\right) = \\frac{(c/B)^{2}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}} \\frac{I}{1 + (k_{ZF}/\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}) I}\n$$\nThis expression perfectly matches the proposed functional form $D(I) = \\frac{C_{S} I}{1 + \\alpha I}$, with the identifications $C_{S} = (c/B)^{2}/\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}}$ and $\\alpha = k_{ZF}/\\gamma_{\\mathrm{lin}} > 0$. The physical basis for this model is exceptionally strong in the context of fusion plasmas. Zonal flows are macroscopic, toroidally and poloidally symmetric ($n=0, m=0$) shear flows that are nonlinearly driven by the ambient small-scale drift-wave turbulence. They, in turn, suppress the same turbulence by shearing its eddies apart. The idea that $\\omega_{\\mathrm{shear}}$ is an increasing function of $I$ (often $\\omega_{\\mathrm{shear}} \\propto I$) is a central tenet of modern turbulence self-regulation theory and is robustly observed in gyrokinetic simulations. This model correctly captures the transition from the weak turbulence limit ($D(I) \\propto I$ for $\\alpha I \\ll 1$) to a saturated state where shear suppression dominates ($D(I) \\to C_S/\\alpha = \\text{constant}$ for $\\alpha I \\gg 1$).\n\n**Verdict**: The form $D(I) = \\dfrac{C_{S}\\, I}{1+\\alpha I}$ is physically justified by the well-established mechanism of turbulence self-regulation via zonal flow shearing. **Correct**.\n\n### Evaluation of Option D\n\n**D. $D(I) = C_{D}\\, I^{2}$, with $C_{D} > 0$, under the assumption that both $\\langle v_{r}^{2}\\rangle$ and $\\tau_{c}$ increase linearly with $I$ across the relevant amplitude range.**\n\nThe problem states that $\\langle v_{r}^{2} \\rangle \\sim (c/B)^{2} I$, so the first part of the assumption, $\\langle v_{r}^{2} \\rangle \\propto I$, is consistent with the problem's framework. The critical new assumption is that the correlation time *increases* linearly with intensity: $\\tau_{c}(I) \\propto I$.\n\nLet's test the consequence of this assumption:\n$$\nD(I) \\sim \\langle v_{r}^{2}\\rangle\\, \\tau_{c}(I) \\propto I \\cdot I = I^{2}\n$$\nThe functional form matches the proposal. However, we must evaluate the physical plausibility of the assumption $\\tau_{c}(I) \\propto I$. The correlation time $\\tau_{c}$ is a measure of the lifetime of a turbulent eddy or a correlated state. All known physical mechanisms of decorrelation in turbulence lead to a *decrease* or, at best, a constancy of $\\tau_{c}$ as the turbulence intensity $I$ increases. A stronger turbulent field (larger $I$) implies more vigorous dynamics, which leads to faster mixing, faster eddy turnover, and/or stronger shear flows—all of which *reduce* the correlation time. An increasing $\\tau_{c}$ with $I$ would imply that turbulence becomes more ordered and long-lived as it becomes more intense. This is an anti-entropic and physically untenable scenario that would lead to explosive, runaway behavior, not saturation and diffusion. It fundamentally contradicts the concept of decorrelation. No well-tested physical mechanism in plasma turbulence supports this assumption.\n\n**Verdict**: The form $D(I) = C_{D}\\, I^{2}$ is based on a physically unsound and unjustifiable assumption that the correlation time increases with turbulence intensity. **Incorrect**.",

Use dimensionless normalized units, and report all outputs as dimensionless numbers.\n\nTest suite (each case specifies $(L,N_x,T,D_0,\\Delta D,I_c,n,S_0,x_0,\\sigma,\\gamma,P,d)$):\n- Case A (happy path with clear avalanches): $(L=1.0,\\;N_x=96,\\;T=0.40,\\;D_0=10^{-3},\\;\\Delta D=0.12,\\;I_c=1.0,\\;n=1.0,\\;S_0=3.0,\\;x_0=0.20,\\;\\sigma=0.04,\\;\\gamma=1.10,\\;P=0.08,\\;d=0.50)$.\n- Case B (subcritical source, no avalanches expected): $(L=1.0,\\;N_x=96,\\;T=0.30,\\;D_0=10^{-3},\\;\\Delta D=0.12,\\;I_c=1.0,\\;n=1.0,\\;S_0=0.40,\\;x_0=0.20,\\;\\sigma=0.04,\\;\\gamma=1.50,\\;P=0.08,\\;d=0.50)$.\n- Case C (strong damping suppresses spreading): $(L=1.0,\\;N_x=96,\\;T=0.30,\\;D_0=10^{-3},\\;\\Delta D=0.12,\\;I_c=1.0,\\;n=1.0,\\;S_0=3.0,\\;x_0=0.20,\\;\\sigma=0.04,\\;\\gamma=4.00,\\;P=0.08,\\;d=0.50)$.\n- Case D (strong jump in transport, highly intermittent): $(L=1.0,\\;N_x=96,\\;T=0.40,\\;D_0=10^{-3},\\;\\Delta D=0.20,\\;I_c=1.0,\\;n=1.0,\\;S_0=3.5,\\;x_0=0.10,\\;\\sigma=0.03,\\;\\gamma=1.20,\\;P=0.06,\\;d=0.50)$.\n\nAdditional numerical specifications:\n- Use a conservative estimate for the stable time step $\\Delta t$ based on the bound\n$$D_{\\max} = D_0 + \\Delta D \\max\\left(1, \\frac{S_0/\\gamma}{I_c}\\right)^n$$\nand\n$$\\Delta t \\le c \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2 D_{\\max}}$$\nwith a safety factor $c=0.4$, where $\\Delta x=L/(N_x-1)$.\n- The source $S(x,t)$ is $S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$ during the active fraction $d$ of each period and $0$ otherwise.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element corresponds to one test case and is itself a list $[\\text{avalanche\\_count}, \\text{max\\_spread\\_radius}, \\text{max\\_front\\_speed}, \\text{intermittency\\_index}]$. For example, the printed format must be like $[[a_1,b_1,c_1,d_1],[a_2,b_2,c_2,d_2],[a_3,b_3,c_3,d_3],[a_4,b_4,c_4,d_4]]$, with all entries represented as plain numbers. No units conversion is required because all quantities are dimensionless by construction.",
            "solution": "The physical model is a one-dimensional nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, which is scientifically sound for modeling transport phenomena such as turbulence spreading in plasmas. The problem is well-posed, with a complete set of parameters, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and clearly defined metrics for analysis. All terms are objective and formalizable.\n\nThe core of the problem is to solve the following partial differential equation (PDE) for the normalized turbulence intensity $I(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left( D(I) \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x} \\right) + S(x,t) - \\gamma I\n$$\nThe domain is $x \\in [0,L]$. The diffusivity $D(I)$ is nonlinear and threshold-dependent:\n$$\nD(I) = D_0 + \\Delta D \\,\\Theta(I - I_c)\\left(\\frac{I}{I_c}\\right)^n\n$$\nwhere $\\Theta(\\cdot)$ is the Heaviside step function. The source term $S(x,t)$ is a spatially Gaussian pulse that is periodically switched on and off. The initial condition is $I(x,0)=0$, and boundary conditions are no-flux at $x=0$ and an absorbing boundary at $x=L$.\n\nThe solution is found by numerically integrating this PDE using the method of lines with finite differences.\n\n**1. Spatial Discretization**\nThe spatial domain $[0,L]$ is discretized into a uniform grid of $N_x$ points, $x_i = i \\cdot \\Delta x$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N_x-1$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = L/(N_x-1)$. The PDE is converted into a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), one for each grid point $I_i(t) \\approx I(x_i, t)$.\n\nUsing a conservative finite difference scheme, the divergence of the flux $\\Gamma = -D(I) \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}$ at an interior grid point $x_i$ ($i=1, \\dots, N_x-2$) is approximated as:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\Gamma}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x_i} \\approx \\frac{\\Gamma_{i+1/2} - \\Gamma_{i-1/2}}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nThe fluxes at the cell interfaces $x_{i \\pm 1/2}$ are approximated using a central difference:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{i+1/2} = -D_{i+1/2} \\frac{I_{i+1} - I_i}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nThe diffusivity at the interface, $D_{i+1/2}$, is evaluated using the average intensity $D_{i+1/2} = D\\left(\\frac{I_i + I_{i+1}}{2}\\right)$. This results in the following ODE for an interior point $I_i$:\n$$\n\\frac{dI_i}{dt} = \\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\left[ D\\left(\\frac{I_i+I_{i+1}}{2}\\right)(I_{i+1} - I_i) - D\\left(\\frac{I_{i-1}+I_i}{2}\\right)(I_i - I_{i-1}) \\right] + S_i(t) - \\gamma I_i\n$$\n\n**2. Boundary Conditions**\n- **Neumann condition at $x=0$ (i=0):** The no-flux condition $\\left.\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=0}=0$ is implemented using a ghost point $I_{-1} = I_1$. Applying the general discretized formula at $i=0$ and substituting $I_{-1}=I_1$ yields the specific update rule for the first grid point:\n$$\n\\frac{dI_0}{dt} = \\frac{2}{(\\Delta x)^2} D\\left(\\frac{I_0+I_1}{2}\\right)(I_1 - I_0) + S_0(t) - \\gamma I_0\n$$\n- **Dirichlet condition at $x=L$ (i=N_x-1):** The absorbing sink condition $I(L,t)=0$ is enforced by setting $I_{N_x-1}=0$ at all times. The ODE for $I_{N_x-2}$ uses this fixed value.\n\n**3. Temporal Discretization**\nThe system of ODEs is integrated in time using the explicit Forward Euler method:\n$$\nI_i^{k+1} = I_i^k + \\Delta t \\cdot \\left(\\frac{dI_i}{dt}\\right)^k\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the time step index. For numerical stability of this explicit scheme for a diffusion problem, the time step $\\Delta t$ must satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. A conservative time step is chosen based on the provided formula:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le c \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2 D_{\\max}}, \\quad \\text{with } c=0.4\n$$\nThe maximum diffusivity $D_{\\max}$ is estimated as $D_{\\max} = D_0 + \\Delta D \\max\\left(1, \\frac{S_0/\\gamma}{I_c}\\right)^n$, which provides a safe upper bound based on a simple estimate of the peak intensity $I \\approx S_0/\\gamma$.\n\n**4. Source Term and Nonlinearity**\nThe source term $S(x,t)$ is implemented as $S(x_i, t_k) = S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x_i-x_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$ if $t_k \\pmod P < d \\cdot P$, and $0$ otherwise. The nonlinear diffusivity function $D(I)$ is applied element-wise to the vectors representing the interface intensities.\n\n**5. Metric Calculation**\nAfter the simulation runs to the final time $T$, the stored time series data are post-processed to compute the four required metrics:\n- **Avalanche count:** The time series of the number of supercritical grid points, $N_c(t) = |\\{i: I_i(t) \\ge I_c\\}|$, is analyzed. An avalanche is counted whenever a continuous period of growth in $N_c(t)$ ends, provided the total increase during that period exceeds a threshold of $0.03 \\cdot N_x$.\n- **Maximum spread radius:** This is the maximum value observed in the time series of the front position, $r_f(t) = \\max(\\{x_i : I_i(t) \\ge I_c\\} \\cup \\{0\\})$.\n- **Maximum front speed:** The forward velocity of the front, $v_f(t) = (r_f(t) - r_f(t-\\Delta t))/\\Delta t$, is calculated at each time step where the front advances ($r_f(t) > r_f(t-\\Delta t)$). The maximum of these velocities over the entire simulation is reported.\n- **Intermittency index:** The outward flux at the boundary $x=L$ is calculated as $J_{\\text{out}}(t) = |\\Gamma(L,t)| = \\left|-D\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}\\right|_{x=L}$. Since $I(L,t)=0$, $D(I(L,t))=D_0$. The gradient is approximated using a second-order, one-sided finite difference: $\\left.\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial x}\\right|_{i=N_x-1} \\approx \\frac{-4I_{N_x-2} + I_{N_x-3}}{2 \\Delta x}$. The intermittency index is the coefficient of variation, $\\sigma_J / \\mu_J$, of the resulting time series $J_{\\text{out}}(t)$. If the mean flux $\\mu_J$ is zero, the index is set to $0$.\n\nThe following implementation encapsulates this entire procedure.",
