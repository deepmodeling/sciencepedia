A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, we derive the steady-state transport equation. The conservation law is given by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = s\n$$\nIn steady state, $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = 0$, so the equation simplifies to $\\frac{d q}{d x} = s$. Integrating with respect to $x$ gives the flux profile\n$$\nq(x) = sx + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is an integration constant. By evaluating at $x=0$, we see that $C = q(0)$, the flux at the boundary $x=0$.\nNow, we substitute the flux closure relation $q(x) = -\\chi \\frac{dT}{dx} + vT$ into the steady-state conservation law $\\frac{d q}{d x} = s$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(-\\chi \\frac{dT}{dx} + vT\\right) = s\n$$\nSince $\\chi$ and $v$ are constants, this yields the second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the steady-state temperature profile $T(x)$:\n$$\n-\\chi \\frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} + v \\frac{dT}{dx} = s \\quad \\implies \\quad \\chi \\frac{d^2 T}{dx^2} - v \\frac{dT}{dx} = -s\n$$\nThis ODE is satisfied by both $T_G(x)$ and $T_Q(x)$.\n\nWe are asked to find $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{mid}} = T_Q(L/2) - T_G(L/2)$. Let's define the difference profile $\\delta T(x) = T_Q(x) - T_G(x)$. Since both $T_Q$ and $T_G$ satisfy the same non-homogeneous ODE, their difference $\\delta T(x)$ must satisfy the corresponding homogeneous ODE:\n$$\n\\chi \\frac{d^2(\\delta T)}{dx^2} - v \\frac{d(\\delta T)}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this homogeneous ODE is $\\delta T(x) = C_1 + C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{v}{\\chi}x\\right)$.\n\nNext, we establish the boundary conditions for $\\delta T(x)$.\nAt $x=L$, both solutions satisfy the same Dirichlet condition: $T_Q(L) = T_L$ and $T_G(L) = T_L$. Therefore, the difference is zero:\n$$\n\\delta T(L) = T_Q(L) - T_G(L) = T_L - T_L = 0\n$$\nApplying this to the general solution for $\\delta T(x)$:\n$$\n\\delta T(L) = C_1 + C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_1 = -C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back into the solution for $\\delta T(x)$:\n$$\n\\delta T(x) = -C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{vx}{\\chi}\\right) = C_2 \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{vx}{\\chi}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\delta T(x) = A \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{v}{\\chi}(x-L)\\right)\\right)$ for some constant $A$.\n\nTo find the constant, we need a condition at $x=0$. Let's examine the difference in fluxes, $\\delta q(x) = q_Q(x) - q_G(x)$. From the integrated conservation law, $q(x) = sx + q(0)$, so\n$$\n\\delta q(x) = (sx + q_Q(0)) - (sx + q_G(0)) = q_Q(0) - q_G(0)\n$$\nThe flux difference is constant. We are given $q_Q(0) = Q_0$. The flux $q_G(0)$ is an outcome of the gradient-driven case. We can also express $\\delta q(x)$ using the flux definition:\n$$\n\\delta q(x) = \\left(-\\chi \\frac{dT_Q}{dx} + vT_Q\\right) - \\left(-\\chi \\frac{dT_G}{dx} + vT_G\\right) = -\\chi \\frac{d(\\delta T)}{dx} + v\\delta T\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\delta q(x)$:\n$$\n-\\chi \\frac{d(\\delta T)}{dx} + v\\delta T = Q_0 - q_G(0)\n$$\nThis is a first-order ODE for $\\delta T(x)$. We can evaluate it at $x=L$. Since $\\delta T(L)=0$, we get:\n$$\n-\\chi \\left.\\frac{d(\\delta T)}{dx}\\right|_{x=L} = Q_0 - q_G(0)\n$$\nFrom our solution $\\delta T(x) = A \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{v}{\\chi}(x-L)\\right)\\right)$, the derivative is $\\frac{d(\\delta T)}{dx} = -A \\frac{v}{\\chi} \\exp\\left(\\frac{v}{\\chi}(x-L)\\right)$. At $x=L$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{d(\\delta T)}{dx}\\right|_{x=L} = -A \\frac{v}{\\chi}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the flux difference equation at $x=L$:\n$$\n-\\chi \\left(-A \\frac{v}{\\chi}\\right) = Q_0 - q_G(0) \\implies Av = Q_0 - q_G(0) \\implies A = \\frac{Q_0 - q_G(0)}{v}\n$$\nSo, the full solution for the difference profile is:\n$$\n\\delta T(x) = \\frac{Q_0 - q_G(0)}{v} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{v}{\\chi}(x-L)\\right)\\right)\n$$\nNow, we must determine $q_G(0)$. The general solution to the steady-state ODE is $T(x) = K_1 + K_2 \\exp\\left(\\frac{v}{\\chi}x\\right) + \\frac{s}{v}x$. For case G, we apply its boundary conditions:\n1. $T_G'(0) = G_0$: $T_G'(x) = K_{2G} \\frac{v}{\\chi}\\exp\\left(\\frac{v}{\\chi}x\\right) + \\frac{s}{v}$. At $x=0$, $K_{2G}\\frac{v}{\\chi} + \\frac{s}{v} = G_0 \\implies K_{2G} = \\frac{\\chi}{v}\\left(G_0 - \\frac{s}{v}\\right)$.\n2. $T_G(L) = T_L$: $K_{1G} + K_{2G}\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) + \\frac{sL}{v} = T_L \\implies K_{1G} = T_L - \\frac{sL}{v} - K_{2G}\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right)$.\n\nThe resulting flux $q_G(0)$ is given by $q_G(0) = -\\chi T_G'(0) + v T_G(0) = -\\chi G_0 + v T_G(0)$.\nWe need $T_G(0) = K_{1G} + K_{2G}$.\n$$\nT_G(0) = \\left( T_L - \\frac{sL}{v} - K_{2G}\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) \\right) + K_{2G} = T_L - \\frac{sL}{v} + K_{2G}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting $K_{2G}$:\n$$\nT_G(0) = T_L - \\frac{sL}{v} + \\frac{\\chi}{v}\\left(G_0 - \\frac{s}{v}\\right)\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nNow we find $q_G(0)$:\n$$\nq_G(0) = -\\chi G_0 + v \\left[ T_L - \\frac{sL}{v} + \\frac{\\chi}{v}\\left(G_0 - \\frac{s}{v}\\right)\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right)\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nq_G(0) = -\\chi G_0 + vT_L - sL + \\chi\\left(G_0 - \\frac{s}{v}\\right)\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nq_G(0) = -\\chi G_0 + vT_L - sL + \\chi G_0 - \\frac{s\\chi}{v} - \\chi G_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) + \\frac{s\\chi}{v}\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nq_G(0) = vT_L - sL - \\frac{s\\chi}{v} - \\left(\\chi G_0 - \\frac{s\\chi}{v}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) = vT_L-sL-\\frac{s\\chi}{v} + \\chi\\left(\\frac{s}{v} - G_0\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the constant $A$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{Q_0 - q_G(0)}{v} = \\frac{1}{v} \\left[ Q_0 - \\left( vT_L - sL - \\frac{s\\chi}{v} + \\chi\\left(\\frac{s}{v} - G_0\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{v} \\left[ Q_0 - vT_L + sL + \\frac{s\\chi}{v} - \\chi\\left(\\frac{s}{v} - G_0\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nA = \\frac{1}{v} \\left[ Q_0 - vT_L + sL + \\frac{s\\chi}{v} + \\chi\\left(G_0 - \\frac{s}{v}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate $\\delta T(x)$ at $x=L/2$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{mid}} = \\delta T(L/2) = A \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(\\frac{v}{\\chi}\\left(\\frac{L}{2}-L\\right)\\right)\\right) = A \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{vL}{2\\chi}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{mid}} = \\frac{1}{v} \\left[ Q_0 - vT_L + sL + \\frac{s\\chi}{v} + \\chi\\left(G_0 - \\frac{s}{v}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{vL}{\\chi}\\right) \\right] \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{vL}{2\\chi}\\right)\\right)\n$$",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe conservation of thermal energy in a one-dimensional system with no volumetric sources is given by:\n$$\nn c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number density and $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure. Fourier's law for heat conduction states that the heat flux $q$ is proportional to the temperature gradient:\n$$\nq = -k_{th} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $k_{th}$ is the thermal conductivity. The problem provides the thermal diffusivity $\\chi$, which is defined as $\\chi = k_{th}/(n c_p)$, assuming $n$ and $c_p$ are constant. Thus, Fourier's law can be written as:\n$$\nq = -n c_p \\chi \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the energy conservation equation, we obtain the one-dimensional heat equation:\n$$\nn c_p \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(n c_p \\chi \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0\n$$\nGiven that $n$, $c_p$, and $\\chi$ are constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\chi \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the solution can be linearized around a steady state. We decompose the temperature $T(x,t)$ into a steady-state component $\\bar{T}(x)$ and a small, time-varying perturbation $\\tilde{T}(x,t)$:\n$$\nT(x,t) = \\bar{T}(x) + \\tilde{T}(x,t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the heat equation and separating the steady and perturbed parts, the equation for the perturbation $\\tilde{T}(x,t)$ is identical in form to the original equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial t} = \\chi \\frac{\\partial^2 \\tilde{T}}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThe core heat flux modulation is harmonic, so we seek a harmonic solution for the temperature perturbation. We use complex notation for convenience, letting $\\tilde{T}(x,t) = \\mathrm{Re}\\{\\hat{T}(x)e^{i\\omega t}\\}$, where $\\hat{T}(x)$ is a complex amplitude that encodes both the spatial amplitude and phase of the perturbation. Substituting this form into the perturbation equation gives:\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{T}(x)e^{i\\omega t} = \\chi \\frac{d^2 \\hat{T}(x)}{dx^2} e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\nThis simplifies to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the complex amplitude $\\hat{T}(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\hat{T}}{dx^2} = \\frac{i\\omega}{\\chi} \\hat{T}\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is of the form $\\hat{T}(x) = C_1 e^{kx} + C_2 e^{-kx}$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are complex constants and $k$ is the complex wave number, defined by:\n$$\nk^2 = \\frac{i\\omega}{\\chi}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the characteristic thickness $\\delta$ of the boundary layer, which corresponds to the exponential decay length of the solution. The fundamental solutions $e^{kx}$ and $e^{-kx}$ describe waves that grow or decay exponentially in space. The e-folding distance for this spatial decay or growth is given by the inverse of the real part of the wave number, $1/|\\mathrm{Re}(k)|$. We now calculate this value.\n\nLet $k = k_r + i k_i$, where $k_r$ and $k_i$ are the real and imaginary parts of $k$, respectively. We must solve for $k_r$. Squaring $k$ gives:\n$$\nk^2 = (k_r + i k_i)^2 = (k_r^2 - k_i^2) + i(2k_r k_i)\n$$\nEquating this with $k^2 = i\\omega/\\chi$, we can separate the real and imaginary parts:\n1.  Real part: $k_r^2 - k_i^2 = 0$\n2.  Imaginary part: $2k_r k_i = \\omega/\\chi$\n\nFrom the first equation, $k_r^2 = k_i^2$, which implies $|k_r| = |k_i|$. For a physically meaningful solution involving propagation and decay, neither $k_r$ nor $k_i$ can be zero. Let's choose $k_r > 0$, corresponding to decay in the $+x$ direction (or growth in the $-x$ direction). This gives two possibilities: $k_i = k_r$ or $k_i = -k_r$. Substituting $k_i = k_r$ into the second equation yields:\n$$\n2k_r(k_r) = \\frac{\\omega}{\\chi} \\implies 2k_r^2 = \\frac{\\omega}{\\chi}\n$$\nSolving for $k_r$:\n$$\nk_r^2 = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\chi} \\implies k_r = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\chi}}\n$$\n(We take the positive root for $k_r$). If we had chosen $k_i = -k_r$, we would get $-2k_r^2 = \\omega/\\chi$, which has no real solution for $k_r$ since $\\omega>0$ and $\\chi>0$. Thus, we must have $k_r = k_i = \\sqrt{\\omega/2\\chi}$.\n\nThe complex wave number is therefore:\n$$\nk = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\chi}} (1+i)\n$$\nThe oscillatory solution's spatial structure contains terms like $e^{\\pm kx}$. The amplitude variation of these terms is of the form $e^{\\pm k_r x}$. The characteristic length over which the amplitude changes by a factor of $e$ is the exponential decay length, $\\delta$, defined as the reciprocal of the real part of the wave number:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{1}{k_r}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_r$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\chi}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\chi}{\\omega}}\n$$\nThis length scale $\\delta$ is inherent to the diffusion process under a high-frequency oscillatory drive and is often called the skin depth or penetration depth. The fixed temperature boundary condition at $x=L$ forces the total temperature perturbation, which is a superposition of the fundamental solutions $e^{kx}$ and $e^{-kx}$, to be zero. The rapid variation and adjustment to zero within a characteristic distance from the boundary define a boundary layer, and the thickness of this layer is governed by the length scale $\\delta$. The high-frequency condition $\\omega L^2/\\chi \\gg 1$ is equivalent to $(L/\\delta)^2 \\gg 1$, which ensures that the slab is many decay lengths wide, making the boundary layer distinct from the core region.\n\nThe requested derivation is complete. The characteristic thickness $\\delta$ is found by analyzing the fundamental solutions to the governing differential equation without recourse to pre-packaged formulas.",

The no-flux boundary condition at the core enforces\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=0} = 0,\n$$\nand the edge is coupled to a sink via a Robin boundary condition that models convective loss to the scrape-off layer,\n$$\n-\\chi\\,\\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=a} = h\\,[T(a,t) - T_{\\mathrm{edge}}],\n$$\nwhere $h$ is a heat-transfer coefficient and $T_{\\mathrm{edge}}$ is a prescribed edge temperature.\n\nThis setup is “flux-driven”: the profile $T(r,t)$ is allowed to evolve in response to the imposed source $S_T(r)$, and the outward heat flux at the edge adjusts self-consistently. In cylindrical geometry, integrating the PDE over $r$ shows that at steady state the outward edge heat flux satisfies\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{out}} = -\\chi\\,\\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=a} = \\frac{1}{a}\\int_{0}^{a} r\\,S_T(r)\\,dr,\n$$\nwhich embodies flux-driven balance.\n\nYour task is to implement a finite-volume method in space with an implicit time integrator to evolve $T(r,t)$ under a constant-in-time source $S_T(r)$ and enforce the above boundary conditions. Use cell-centered discretization with $N$ uniform radial cells, cell centers at $r_i = \\left(i + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right)\\Delta r$ for $i \\in \\{0,\\dots,N-1\\}$, and faces at $r_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = (i+1)\\Delta r$ with $\\Delta r = a/N$. The heating source is prescribed as a Gaussian,\n$$\nS_T(r) = S_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{r}{r_s}\\right)^2\\right),\n$$\nwith constant amplitude $S_0$ and scale length $r_s$. Initialize $T(r,0) = 0$ for all $r$.\n\nImplement the discrete fluxes consistent with cylindrical geometry. The inner face flux at $r=0$ must be zero to enforce the no-flux core boundary condition. The outer face flux at $r=a$ must satisfy the Robin condition, which in the finite-volume formulation translates into eliminating the ghost cell using the relation\n$$\n-\\chi\\,\\frac{T_N - T_{N-1}}{\\Delta r} = h\\,[T_{N-1} - T_{\\mathrm{edge}}],\n$$\nwhere $T_N$ is the ghost value beyond the edge and $T_{N-1}$ is the edge cell-center value. Use an implicit Euler time step of size $\\Delta t$ to evolve to a final time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, constructing the linear system\n$$\n\\left(\\mathbf{I} - \\Delta t\\,\\mathbf{L}\\right)\\,\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{T}^{n} + \\Delta t\\,\\left(\\mathbf{S} + \\mathbf{g}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{L}$ is the discrete diffusion operator incorporating the geometry and boundary conditions, $\\mathbf{S}$ is the discrete source vector, and $\\mathbf{g}$ is the constant vector arising from the Robin boundary condition’s edge temperature term.\n\nUnits: use meters (m) for $r$, seconds (s) for $t$, kilo-electronvolts (keV) for $T$, meters squared per second ($\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$) for $\\chi$, meters per second ($\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$) for $h$, and kilo-electronvolts per second (keV/s) for $S_T$. Report the final outward edge heat flux $F_{\\mathrm{out}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$ in keV·m/s and the magnitude of the core gradient $\\left|\\partial T/\\partial r\\right|_{r=0}(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$ in keV/m.\n\nDesign a program that computes these two quantities for each test case described below. Use the following test suite, which covers a general case, a zero-source edge case, a high-diffusivity case, and a small-domain weak-sink case:\n\n- Test Case $1$ (general “happy path”): $a = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\chi = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $h = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{edge}} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, $S_0 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}/\\mathrm{s}$, $r_s = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $N = 256$, $\\Delta t = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Test Case $2$ (zero source): $a = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\chi = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $h = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{edge}} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, $S_0 = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}/\\mathrm{s}$, $r_s = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $N = 256$, $\\Delta t = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Test Case $3$ (high diffusivity): $a = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\chi = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $h = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{edge}} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, $S_0 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}/\\mathrm{s}$, $r_s = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $N = 256$, $\\Delta t = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Test Case $4$ (small domain, weak sink): $a = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\chi = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $h = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{edge}} = 0.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, $S_0 = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{keV}/\\mathrm{s}$, $r_s = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $N = 256$, $\\Delta t = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFor each test case, compute:\n- The final outward edge heat flux $F_{\\mathrm{out}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = h\\,[T(a,t_{\\mathrm{end}}) - T_{\\mathrm{edge}}]$ in keV·m/s.\n- The magnitude of the core gradient $\\left|\\partial T/\\partial r\\right|_{r=0}(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$ in keV/m, approximated by the one-sided difference at the innermost cell centers.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

            "solution": "The problem requires the numerical solution of a one-dimensional radial heat transport equation in cylindrical geometry using a finite-volume method. We will first validate the problem statement and then develop the solution by discretizing the governing partial differential equation (PDE) and implementing the specified boundary conditions.\n\nThe governing PDE for the temperature profile $T(r,t)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\,\\chi\\,\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right) + S_T(r)\n$$\nThis equation describes the conservation of energy, where the change in temperature over time is driven by heat diffusion (the first term on the right-hand side) and a volumetric heat source $S_T(r)$. The thermal diffusivity $\\chi$ is assumed to be constant.\n\nTo solve this equation numerically, we employ a finite-volume method. The radial domain $r \\in [0, a]$ is divided into $N$ uniform cells. The $i$-th cell, for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, is defined by the interval $[r_{i-1/2}, r_{i+1/2}]$, where cell faces are located at $r_{i+1/2} = (i+1)\\Delta r$ with $\\Delta r = a/N$. The cell centers are at $r_i = (i + 1/2)\\Delta r$. The temperature within cell $i$ is represented by a single value $T_i(t)$, which is an approximation of the temperature at the cell center, $T(r_i, t)$.\n\nWe begin by multiplying the PDE by $r$ and integrating over the volume of the $i$-th cell, which in one dimension (per unit length and angle) corresponds to integrating from $r_{i-1/2}$ to $r_{i+1/2}$:\n$$\n\\int_{r_{i-1/2}}^{r_{i+1/2}} r \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\,dr = \\int_{r_{i-1/2}}^{r_{i+1/2}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r\\,\\chi\\,\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right) \\,dr + \\int_{r_{i-1/2}}^{r_{i+1/2}} r S_T(r) \\,dr\n$$\nApproximating the integrals with midpoint rule values for quantities that vary smoothly over the cell, we get:\n$$\n(r_i \\Delta r) \\frac{dT_i}{dt} \\approx \\left[r\\,\\chi\\,\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right]_{r_{i+1/2}} - \\left[r\\,\\chi\\,\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right]_{r_{i-1/2}} + (r_i \\Delta r) S_T(r_i)\n$$\nThe terms on the right-hand side represent the heat fluxes across the cell faces. Let's define the radial heat flux density as $F_r = -\\chi \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}$, so the term $r \\chi \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}$ is $-r F_r$. We discretize the spatial derivative using a central difference scheme at the cell faces:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r_{i+1/2}} \\approx \\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\\Delta r}\n$$\nThe flux term at the face $r_{i+1/2}$ becomes:\n$$\nJ_{i+1/2} = \\left[r\\,\\chi\\,\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right]_{r_{i+1/2}} \\approx r_{i+1/2} \\chi \\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\\Delta r}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integrated equation and dividing by $r_i \\Delta r$ gives the semi-discrete equation for an interior cell $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N-2\\}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_i}{dt} = \\frac{1}{r_i \\Delta r} \\left( r_{i+1/2} \\chi \\frac{T_{i+1} - T_i}{\\Delta r} - r_{i-1/2} \\chi \\frac{T_i - T_{i-1}}{\\Delta r} \\right) + S_i\n$$\nwhere $S_i = S_T(r_i)$.\n\nNow, we must incorporate the boundary conditions for the cells at the core ($i=0$) and the edge ($i=N-1$).\n\nFor the core cell ($i=0$), the domain is $[r_{-1/2}, r_{1/2}] = [0, \\Delta r]$. The no-flux boundary condition at the center, $\\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=0} = 0$, implies that the flux at the face $r_{-1/2}=0$ is zero, i.e., $J_{-1/2} = 0$. The equation for cell $0$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_0}{dt} = \\frac{1}{r_0 \\Delta r} \\left( J_{1/2} - J_{-1/2} \\right) + S_0 = \\frac{1}{r_0 \\Delta r} \\left( r_{1/2} \\chi \\frac{T_1 - T_0}{\\Delta r} - 0 \\right) + S_0\n$$\nSubstituting $r_0 = \\Delta r/2$ and $r_{1/2} = \\Delta r$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_0}{dt} = \\frac{1}{(\\Delta r/2) \\Delta r} \\left( \\Delta r \\chi \\frac{T_1 - T_0}{\\Delta r} \\right) + S_0 = \\frac{2\\chi}{\\Delta r^2} (T_1 - T_0) + S_0\n$$\n\nFor the edge cell ($i=N-1$), the domain is $[r_{N-3/2}, r_{N-1/2}] = [r_{N-3/2}, a]$. The flux at the outer face $r_{N-1/2}=a$ is determined by the Robin boundary condition:\n$$\n-\\chi\\,\\left.\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=a} = h\\,[T(a,t) - T_{\\mathrm{edge}}]\n$$\nThe flux term $J_{N-1/2}$ is $\\left. r \\chi \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=a} = a \\chi \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r} \\right|_{r=a}$. Using the Robin condition, this becomes:\n$$\nJ_{N-1/2} = -a h [T(a,t) - T_{\\mathrm{edge}}]\n$$\nWe approximate the temperature at the boundary $T(a,t)$ with the temperature of the last cell center, $T_{N-1}$. Thus, $J_{N-1/2} \\approx -a h (T_{N-1} - T_{\\mathrm{edge}})$. The equation for cell $N-1$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_{N-1}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{r_{N-1} \\Delta r} \\left( J_{N-1/2} - J_{N-3/2} \\right) + S_{N-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dT_{N-1}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{r_{N-1} \\Delta r} \\left( -a h (T_{N-1} - T_{\\mathrm{edge}}) - r_{N-3/2} \\chi \\frac{T_{N-1} - T_{N-2}}{\\Delta r} \\right) + S_{N-1}\n$$\nThis system of $N$ ordinary differential equations can be written in matrix form:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{dt} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{T} + \\mathbf{S} + \\mathbf{g}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{T}$ is the vector of cell temperatures $[T_0, T_1, \\dots, T_{N-1}]^T$, $\\mathbf{L}$ is the tridiagonal matrix representing the discretized diffusion operator, $\\mathbf{S}$ is the vector of source terms $[S_0, S_1, \\dots, S_{N-1}]^T$, and $\\mathbf{g}$ is a vector containing the constant part of the boundary condition. Only the last element of $\\mathbf{g}$ is non-zero: $g_{N-1} = \\frac{ahT_{\\mathrm{edge}}}{r_{N-1}\\Delta r}$. The matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ has the following non-zero elements:\n- Upper diagonal ($i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-2\\}$): $L_{i, i+1} = \\frac{\\chi}{\\Delta r^2} \\frac{r_{i+1/2}}{r_i} = \\frac{\\chi}{\\Delta r^2} \\frac{i+1}{i+0.5}$\n- Main diagonal ($i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-2\\}$): $L_{i,i} = -\\frac{\\chi}{\\Delta r^2}\\frac{r_{i+1/2}+r_{i-1/2}}{r_i} = - \\frac{2\\chi}{\\Delta r^2}$ (with $r_{-1/2}=0$ for $i=0$)\n- Main diagonal (edge, $i=N-1$): $L_{N-1,N-1} = -\\frac{ah}{r_{N-1}\\Delta r} - \\frac{\\chi r_{N-3/2}}{r_{N-1}\\Delta r^2} = -\\frac{Nh}{(N-0.5)\\Delta r} - \\frac{\\chi(N-1)}{(N-0.5)\\Delta r^2}$\n- Lower diagonal ($i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N-1\\}$): $L_{i, i-1} = \\frac{\\chi}{\\Delta r^2} \\frac{r_{i-1/2}}{r_i} = \\frac{\\chi}{\\Delta r^2} \\frac{i}{i+0.5}$\n\nFor time integration, we use the implicit Euler method, which is unconditionally stable. The time derivative is approximated as $\\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{dt} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{T}^n}{\\Delta t}$. The implicit scheme evaluates the right-hand side at the future time step $n+1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} - \\mathbf{T}^n}{\\Delta t} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{T}^{n+1} + \\mathbf{S} + \\mathbf{g}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $\\mathbf{T}^{n+1}$, we get the linear system specified in the problem:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{I} - \\Delta t \\mathbf{L}) \\mathbf{T}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{T}^n + \\Delta t (\\mathbf{S} + \\mathbf{g})\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix. At each time step, we solve this tridiagonal linear system for $\\mathbf{T}^{n+1}$. The initial condition is $T(r,0)=0$, so $\\mathbf{T}^0 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nAfter evolving the system to the final time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, we compute the required quantities.\nThe final outward edge heat flux is given by the convective loss term:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{out}}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = h\\,[T(a,t_{\\mathrm{end}}) - T_{\\mathrm{edge}}] \\approx h\\,[T_{N-1}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) - T_{\\mathrm{edge}}]\n$$\nThe magnitude of the core gradient is approximated using a one-sided finite difference between the two innermost cell centers:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=0}(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) \\approx \\left| \\frac{T_1(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) - T_0(t_{\\mathrm{end}})}{\\Delta r} \\right|\n$$\nThis quantity is a simple numerical diagnostic of the profile shape near the core, though it represents the gradient at $r \\approx \\Delta r/2$ rather than at $r=0$, where the analytical gradient is zero by symmetry.",
