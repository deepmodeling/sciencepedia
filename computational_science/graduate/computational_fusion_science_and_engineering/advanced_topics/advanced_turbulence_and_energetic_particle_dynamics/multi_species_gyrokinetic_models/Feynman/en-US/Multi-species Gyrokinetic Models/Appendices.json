            "problem": "In an electrostatic, collisionless, homogeneous magnetized plasma described by the multi-species gyrokinetic model, the coupling of species to perpendicular fluctuations of wavevector magnitude $k_{\\perp}$ is controlled by the gyroaveraging of a plane wave over the cyclotron orbit of radius $\\rho_{s}$ for species $s$. Starting from first principles, the gyroaverage is the gyrophase average of $\\exp(i \\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\rho})$ over a circular orbit at fixed $\\rho_{s}$ and gyrophase angle $\\theta$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ is the Larmor displacement vector.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, self-contained problem in computational fusion science that is based on fundamental principles of gyrokinetics. The provided definitions and conditions are consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution is presented below.\n\n1) The gyroaveraging factor is defined as the gyrophase average of the plane wave phase factor $\\exp(i \\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\rho})$ over all possible orientations of the Larmor displacement vector $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ for a fixed Larmor radius $\\rho_{s}$. The average is taken over the gyrophase angle $\\theta$. The gyroaverage is denoted as $\\langle \\exp(i \\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\rho}) \\rangle_{\\theta}$.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system where the uniform magnetic field $\\boldsymbol{B}$ is directed along the $\\hat{z}$-axis. The wavevector $\\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp}$ and the Larmor displacement vector $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ lie in the plane perpendicular to $\\boldsymbol{B}$, which is the $xy$-plane. Without loss of generality, we can align the coordinate system such that $\\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp}$ points along the $\\hat{x}$-axis, so $\\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp} = k_{\\perp} \\hat{x}$, where $k_{\\perp} = |\\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp}|$.\n\nThe Larmor displacement vector $\\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ traces a circular path in the $xy$-plane. Its position can be described as a function of the gyrophase angle $\\theta$ and the Larmor radius $\\rho_{s}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\rho} = \\rho_{s} (\\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{x} + \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{y}) $$\nThe dot product $\\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\rho}$ is then:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\rho} = (k_{\\perp} \\hat{x}) \\cdot (\\rho_{s} \\cos\\theta \\, \\hat{x} + \\rho_{s} \\sin\\theta \\, \\hat{y}) = k_{\\perp} \\rho_{s} \\cos\\theta $$\nThe gyroaverage is the integral over all gyrophase angles $\\theta$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$, normalized by the total angle $2\\pi$:\n$$ \\langle \\exp(i \\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\rho}) \\rangle_{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(i k_{\\perp} \\rho_{s} \\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta $$\nThis integral is a standard integral representation of the zeroth-order Bessel function of the first kind, $J_{0}(x)$. The general integral representation is:\n$$ J_{n}(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(i(x \\sin\\theta - n\\theta)) \\, d\\theta $$\nA more convenient representation for our purpose is derived from the Jacobi-Anger expansion:\n$$ \\exp(iz\\cos\\theta) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} i^{n} J_{n}(z) \\exp(in\\theta) $$\nIntegrating both sides over $\\theta$ from $0$ to $2\\pi$ and dividing by $2\\pi$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(iz\\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} i^{n} J_{n}(z) \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(in\\theta) \\, d\\theta $$\nThe integral on the right-hand side is $2\\pi$ if $n=0$ and $0$ otherwise. Thus, only the $n=0$ term of the sum survives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\exp(iz\\cos\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} (i^{0} J_{0}(z) \\cdot 2\\pi) = J_{0}(z) $$\nBy setting $z = k_{\\perp}\\rho_{s}$, we find that the analytic form of the gyroaveraging factor is:\n$$ \\langle \\exp(i \\boldsymbol{k}_{\\perp} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\rho}) \\rangle_{\\theta} = J_{0}(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{s}) $$\n\n2) We are asked to compute the values of the ion gyroaveraging factor, $J_{0}(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i})$, for $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} = 0.1$, $0.5$, and $1.0$. The series expansion for $J_{0}(x)$ is $J_{0}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k}}{(k!)^{2}} \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^{2k} = 1 - \\frac{x^{2}}{4} + \\frac{x^{4}}{64} - O(x^{6})$. Using this or standard numerical libraries, we compute the values and round to four significant figures.\n\nFor $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} = 0.1$:\n$$ J_{0}(0.1) \\approx 0.99750156 \\dots \\approx 0.9975 $$\nFor $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} = 0.5$:\n$$ J_{0}(0.5) \\approx 0.93846980 \\dots \\approx 0.9385 $$\nFor $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} = 1.0$:\n$$ J_{0}(1.0) \\approx 0.76519768 \\dots \\approx 0.7652 $$\n\n3) We are given an electron-ion plasma with $Z_{i}=1$, $Z_{e}=-1$, $T_{e}=T_{i}$, and $m_{i}=m_{p}$. We first find the ratio $\\rho_{e}/\\rho_{i}$. The Larmor radius for a species $s$ is defined using its thermal velocity $v_{\\mathrm{th},s} = \\sqrt{2 T_{s}/m_{s}}$ and cyclotron frequency $\\Omega_{s} = Z_{s} e B/m_{s}$. Since radius must be a positive quantity, we use the magnitude of the cyclotron frequency:\n$$ \\rho_{s} = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{th},s}}{|\\Omega_{s}|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 T_{s}/m_{s}}}{|Z_{s}| e B/m_{s}} = \\frac{m_{s}}{|Z_{s}| e B} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 T_{s}}{m_{s}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m_{s} T_{s}}}{|Z_{s}| e B} $$\nThe ratio of the electron Larmor radius to the ion Larmor radius is:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_{e}}{\\rho_{i}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 m_{e} T_{e}}/(|Z_{e}| e B)}{\\sqrt{2 m_{i} T_{i}}/(|Z_{i}| e B)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{m_{e}T_{e}}}{\\sqrt{m_{i}T_{i}}} \\frac{|Z_{i}|}{|Z_{e}|} $$\nUsing the given conditions $T_{e}=T_{i}$, $|Z_{i}|=1$, and $|Z_{e}|=|-1|=1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho_{e}}{\\rho_{i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{e}}{m_{i}}} $$\nNext, we find the value of $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i}$ at which $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e} = 1$. From this condition, we have $k_{\\perp} = 1/\\rho_{e}$. Substituting this into the expression for the ion argument:\n$$ k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\rho_{e}}\\right)\\rho_{i} = \\frac{\\rho_{i}}{\\rho_{e}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_{i}}{m_{e}}} $$\nFor a protonic ion, $m_{i}=m_{p}$. The proton-to-electron mass ratio is $m_{p}/m_{e} \\approx 1836.15$. The value is $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{i} \\approx \\sqrt{1836.15} \\approx 42.85$. This represents the ion-scale wavenumber corresponding to the electron-scale condition $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e} = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the electron gyroaveraging factor $J_{0}(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e})$ for $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e} = 1$ and $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e} = 2$.\nFor $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e} = 1.0$:\n$$ J_{0}(1.0) \\approx 0.76519768 \\dots \\approx 0.7652 $$\nFor $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e} = 2.0$:\n$$ J_{0}(2.0) \\approx 0.22389077 \\dots \\approx 0.2239 $$\n\n4) The gyroaveraging factor $J_{0}(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{s})$ quantifies how strongly a particle of species $s$ couples to an electrostatic potential fluctuation with perpendicular wavevector $k_{\\perp}$. The function $J_{0}(x)$ has its maximum value of $1$ at $x=0$ and decays in an oscillatory manner as $x$ increases. A value of $J_{0}(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{s})$ close to $1$ means strong coupling, while a value close to $0$ implies weak coupling, or decoupling.\n\nThe condition $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e} \\gtrsim 1$ corresponds to fluctuations whose perpendicular wavelength $\\lambda_{\\perp} = 2\\pi/k_{\\perp}$ is comparable to or smaller than the electron Larmor radius $\\rho_{e}$. As shown in part 3, the value of $J_{0}(k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e})$ drops from $1$ (for $k_{\\perp}\\rho_e \\ll 1$) to $0.7652$ at $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e}=1$ and further to $0.2239$ at $k_{\\perp}\\rho_{e}=2$. For even larger arguments, the function continues to decrease in amplitude. Physically, when the fluctuation wavelength is much smaller than the gyroradius, the particle's circular orbit traverses many positive and negative phases of the wave potential. The net effect of the potential, when averaged over the orbit, becomes very small. This is the mechanism of gyrokinetic decoupling. Electrons, due to their small mass and consequently small Larmor radius (for a given temperature), decouple from fluctuations at much smaller spatial scales (larger $k_{\\perp}$) than ions.\n\nThe leading-order asymptotic expression for the zeroth-order Bessel function $J_{0}(x)$ for large argument $x \\to \\infty$ is given by:\n$$ J_{0}(x) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi x}} \\cos\\left(x - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) $$\nThis expression shows that the amplitude of the gyroaveraging factor decays as $x^{-1/2} = (k_{\\perp}\\rho_{s})^{-1/2}$, confirming that the coupling to fluctuations becomes vanishingly small at large $k_{\\perp}\\rho_s$. This completes the explanation for the decoupling. The final quantitative statement required is this asymptotic expression.",

The use of quasi-neutrality to relate species densities is a core principle of plasma physics. All parameters are physically realistic for a modern tokamak. The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective and sufficient information to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the linearized, bounce-averaged gyrokinetic equation for the non-adiabatic part of the trapped electron distribution function, denoted $\\delta g_{e}$. In its general form, this equation balances the effects of mode frequency, magnetic drifts, and collisions against the wave-particle resonance driving term.\n$$(\\omega - \\langle \\omega_{De} \\rangle + i C_{e}) \\delta g_{e} = (\\omega - \\omega_{*e}^{T}) \\frac{e \\langle \\phi \\rangle}{T_e} F_{M,e}$$\nHere, $\\omega$ is the complex mode frequency, $\\langle \\omega_{De} \\rangle$ is the bounce-averaged magnetic drift frequency, $C_{e}$ is the collision operator, $\\omega_{*e}^{T}$ is the total electron diamagnetic frequency (including density and temperature gradients), $\\langle \\phi \\rangle$ is the bounce-averaged electrostatic potential fluctuation, $e$ is the elementary charge, $T_e$ is the electron temperature, and $F_{M,e}$ is the background Maxwellian distribution.\n\nThe problem specifies a Krook model for pitch-angle scattering, so we replace the operator $C_{e}$ with an effective collision frequency, $\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}$. Furthermore, we are given the ordering $|\\langle \\omega_{De} \\rangle| \\ll |\\omega|$, which allows us to neglect the drift frequency term in the denominator. The equation for $\\delta g_{e}$ simplifies to:\n$$(\\omega + i \\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}) \\delta g_{e} \\approx (\\omega - \\omega_{*e}^{T}) \\frac{e \\langle \\phi \\rangle}{T_e} F_{M,e}$$\nSolving for $\\delta g_{e}$:\n$$\\delta g_{e} \\approx \\frac{(\\omega - \\omega_{*e}^{T})}{\\omega + i \\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\frac{e \\langle \\phi \\rangle}{T_e} F_{M,e}$$\nThe non-adiabatic part of the trapped electron density perturbation, $\\delta n_{e, \\mathrm{trap}}^{\\mathrm{na}}$, is obtained by integrating $\\delta g_{e}$ over the trapped region of velocity space. This integration yields:\n$$\\delta n_{e, \\mathrm{trap}}^{\\mathrm{na}} = \\int_{\\mathrm{trap}} \\delta g_{e} \\, d^{3}v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega + i \\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}}$$\nThe amplitude of this response is therefore proportional to the magnitude of this complex fraction:\n$$|\\delta n_{e, \\mathrm{trap}}^{\\mathrm{na}}| \\propto \\frac{1}{|\\omega + i \\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}|}$$\nThis confirms that the amplitude of the non-adiabatic trapped electron density response scales inversely with the complex denominator $|\\omega + i \\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}|$.\n\nNext, we determine the effective collision frequency $\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in the presence of impurities. We are given that the electron-ion collision frequency is proportional to $\\sum_{a} n_{a} Z_{a}^{2}$, where the sum is over all ion species $a$. Let the proportionality constant be $C$.\n$$\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = C \\sum_{a} n_{a} Z_{a}^{2}$$\nIn our case, the ion species are the main ions ($a=i$) and the impurity ions ($a=Z$).\n$$\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = C (n_{i} Z_{i}^{2} + n_{Z} Z_{Z}^{2})$$\nThe baseline collision rate, $\\nu_{0}$, corresponds to a pure plasma with only the main ion species. In this case, $n_{Z}=0$ and quasi-neutrality implies $n_{i} = n_{e}$. With $Z_i=1$, we have:\n$$\\nu_{0} = C (n_{e} \\cdot 1^{2}) = C n_{e}$$\nThis allows us to determine the constant $C = \\nu_{0}/n_{e}$.\n\nNow, we consider the plasma with impurities. The quasi-neutrality condition is $n_{e} = Z_{i} n_{i} + Z_{Z} n_{Z}$. Given $Z_{i}=1$, this becomes $n_{e} = n_{i} + Z_{Z} n_{Z}$, which gives the main ion density as $n_{i} = n_{e} - Z_{Z} n_{Z}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = C ((n_{e} - Z_{Z} n_{Z}) Z_{i}^{2} + n_{Z} Z_{Z}^{2})$$\nUsing $Z_i=1$ and the definition $f_{Z} = n_{Z}/n_{e}$ (so $n_{Z} = f_{Z} n_{e}$):\n$$\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = C ((n_{e} - Z_{Z} f_{Z} n_{e}) \\cdot 1^{2} + f_{Z} n_{e} Z_{Z}^{2}) = C n_{e} (1 - Z_{Z} f_{Z} + f_{Z} Z_{Z}^{2})$$\nSubstituting $C = \\nu_{0}/n_{e}$:\n$$\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\nu_{0}}{n_{e}} n_{e} (1 - Z_{Z} f_{Z} + f_{Z} Z_{Z}^{2}) = \\nu_{0} (1 - Z_{Z} f_{Z} + f_{Z} Z_{Z}^{2})$$\nThis expression relates the effective collision rate in the impure plasma to the baseline rate. The term in parenthesis is the effective charge, $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sum_a n_a Z_a^2 / n_e$.\n\nFinally, we compute the multiplicative reduction factor $F$ using the given parameters. First, we calculate the numerical value of $\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n- $Z_{Z} = 74$\n- $f_{Z} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- $\\nu_{0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\n$$\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\left(1 - (74)(1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})(74)^{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) (1 - 0.0074 + 0.5476) = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) (1.5402) = 1.5402 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe presence of the high-$Z$ impurity increases the effective collision frequency significantly.\n\nNow we compute the factor $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\left| \\omega + i \\nu_{0} \\right|}{\\left| \\omega + i \\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}} \\right|}$$\nGiven $\\omega = \\omega_{r} + i \\gamma = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) + i (5.0 \\times 10^{4})\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\nThe numerator term is:\n$$\\omega + i \\nu_{0} = (1.0 \\times 10^{5} + i \\cdot 5.0 \\times 10^{4}) + i (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{5} + i (1.5 \\times 10^{5})$$\nThe magnitude is:\n$$|\\omega + i \\nu_{0}| = \\sqrt{(1.0 \\times 10^{5})^{2} + (1.5 \\times 10^{5})^{2}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\sqrt{1.0^{2} + 1.5^{2}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\sqrt{1.0 + 2.25} = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\sqrt{3.25}$$\nThe denominator term is:\n$$\\omega + i \\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{5} + i \\cdot 5.0 \\times 10^{4}) + i (1.5402 \\times 10^{5}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{5} + i (2.0402 \\times 10^{5})$$\nThe magnitude is:\n$$|\\omega + i \\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}| = \\sqrt{(1.0 \\times 10^{5})^{2} + (2.0402 \\times 10^{5})^{2}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\sqrt{1.0^{2} + 2.0402^{2}}$$\n$$|\\omega + i \\nu_{e}^{\\mathrm{eff}}| = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\sqrt{1.0 + 4.16241604} = (1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\sqrt{5.16241604}$$\nThe factor $F$ is the ratio of these magnitudes:\n$$F = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\sqrt{3.25}}{(1.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\sqrt{5.16241604}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3.25}{5.16241604}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.629550} \\approx 0.793442$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $F \\approx 0.7934$.

However, this relies on the assumption of a stationary background, which is often violated in real plasmas with heating or transport. This problem challenges you to analyze the error introduced in a $\\delta f$ simulation when the background temperature slowly evolves, a critical consideration for ensuring the accuracy and validity of long-time simulations .",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Problem Solution**\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1) Derivation of the ion non-adiabatic response $\\hat{h}_i(v; T_i)$**\n\nThe perturbed ion distribution function $\\delta f_i$ is decomposed into an adiabatic part and a non-adiabatic part $h_i$. In the electrostatic limit, this is commonly written as $\\delta f_i = -\\frac{Z e \\phi}{T_i} F_{0i} + h_i$. The linear gyrokinetic (GK) equation governs the evolution of the non-adiabatic part $h_i$. In its general form, the equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h_i}{\\partial t} + v_{\\parallel} \\nabla_{\\parallel} h_i + \\mathbf{v}_D \\cdot \\nabla_{\\perp} h_i - C(h_i) = - \\frac{Ze F_{0i}}{T_i}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}_{*i} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\perp}\\right) \\langle \\phi \\rangle\n$$\nWe apply the simplifications provided in the problem statement:\n- **Homogeneous plasma**: Gradients of background density $n_i$ and temperature $T_i$ are zero. This implies the diamagnetic drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{*i}$ is zero.\n- **Uniform magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$**: The magnetic drift velocity $\\mathbf{v}_D$ (due to $\\nabla B$ and curvature) is zero.\n- **$k_{\\parallel} = 0$**: For a single Fourier mode, the term $v_{\\parallel} \\nabla_{\\parallel} h_i$ becomes $i k_{\\parallel} v_{\\parallel} \\hat{h}_i = 0$.\n- **Long-wavelength limit $k_{\\perp} \\rho_i \\ll 1$**: The gyroaverage of the potential $\\langle \\phi \\rangle$, given by $J_0(k_{\\perp} \\rho_i) \\phi$, simplifies to $\\phi$ since the Bessel function $J_0(x) \\approx 1$ for small $x$.\n- **Collision operator**: $C(h_i) = -\\nu_i h_i$.\n\nWith these simplifications, the GK equation reduces significantly to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h_i}{\\partial t} - (-\\nu_i h_i) = - \\frac{Ze F_{0i}}{T_i} \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h_i}{\\partial t} + \\nu_i h_i = - \\frac{Ze F_{0i}(v; T_i)}{T_i} \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}\n$$\nWe are considering a single-frequency perturbation, so we substitute the complex forms $\\phi(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\hat{\\phi} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} - i\\omega t)$ and $h_i(\\mathbf{x}, v, t) = \\hat{h}_i(v) \\exp(i\\mathbf{k}_{\\perp}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} - i\\omega t)$. The time derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is replaced by $-i\\omega$.

The response computed by such a simulation, which we denote $\\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0})$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0}) = \\frac{i \\omega}{\\nu_i - i \\omega} \\frac{Z e \\hat{\\phi}}{T_{i0}} F_{0i}(v; T_{i0})\n$$\nThe fractional error $\\varepsilon(v)$ is defined as $\\varepsilon(v) = \\frac{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_i) - \\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0})}{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_i)}$. For a small temperature change $\\delta T = T_i - T_{i0}$, we can approximate this using a first-order Taylor expansion.\n$$\n\\varepsilon(v) = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0})}{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_i)}\n$$\nLet's analyze the ratio of the responses. The prefactor $\\frac{i \\omega}{\\nu_i - i \\omega} Z e \\hat{\\phi}$ is common and cancels. Let $g(T) = \\frac{F_{0i}(v; T)}{T}$. Then $\\hat{h}_i(v; T) \\propto g(T)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0})}{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_i)} = \\frac{g(T_{i0})}{g(T_i)}\n$$\nWe expand $g(T_i)$ around $T_{i0}$ for small $\\delta T$: $g(T_i) \\approx g(T_{i0}) + \\delta T \\left.\\frac{dg}{dT}\\right|_{T=T_{i0}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{g(T_{i0})}{g(T_i)} \\approx \\frac{g(T_{i0})}{g(T_{i0}) + \\delta T g'(T_{i0})} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\delta T \\frac{g'(T_{i0})}{g(T_{i0})}} \\approx 1 - \\delta T \\frac{g'(T_{i0})}{g(T_{i0})}\n$$\nThe quantity $\\frac{g'(T_{i0})}{g(T_{i0})}$ is the logarithmic derivative $\\left.\\frac{d}{dT} \\ln(g(T))\\right|_{T=T_{i0}}$.\n$g(T) = T^{-1} F_{0i}(v; T) = T^{-1} n_i \\left(\\frac{m_i}{2 \\pi T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_i v^2}{2 T}\\right) = (\\text{const}) \\cdot T^{-5/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m_i v^2}{2 T}\\right)$.\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(g(T)) = \\ln(\\text{const}) - \\frac{5}{2}\\ln(T) - \\frac{m_i v^2}{2 T}\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $T$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dT}\\ln(g(T)) = -\\frac{5}{2T} + \\frac{m_i v^2}{2 T^2} = \\frac{1}{T}\\left(\\frac{m_i v^2}{2 T} - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the ratio, evaluated at $T=T_{i0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0})}{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_i)} \\approx 1 - \\frac{\\delta T}{T_{i0}}\\left(\\frac{m_i v^2}{2 T_{i0}} - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, the fractional error $\\varepsilon(v)$ is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(v) = 1 - \\frac{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0})}{\\hat{h}_i(v; T_i)} \\approx \\frac{\\delta T}{T_{i0}}\\left(\\frac{m_i v^2}{2 T_{i0}} - \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n$$\n\n**3) Computation of the leading correction term $\\delta \\hat{h}_i(v)$**\n\nThe correction term $\\delta \\hat{h}_i(v)$ is defined to restore consistency to first order in $\\delta T$, such that $\\hat{h}_i(v; T_i) \\approx \\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0}) + \\delta \\hat{h}_i(v)$. This is simply the first-order term in the Taylor expansion of $\\hat{h}_i(v; T_i)$ around $T_{i0}$:\n$$\n\\delta \\hat{h}_i(v) = \\hat{h}_i(v; T_i) - \\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0}) \\approx \\delta T \\left.\\frac{\\partial \\hat{h}_i(v; T)}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T=T_{i0}}\n$$\nWe can express the derivative in terms of the logarithmic derivative found previously:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\partial \\hat{h}_i(v; T)}{\\partial T}\\right|_{T=T_{i0}} = \\hat{h}_i(v; T_{i0}) \\left.\\frac{d}{dT}\\ln(\\hat{h}_i(v; T))\\right|_{T=T_{i0}}\n$$\nSince $\\hat{h}_i \\propto g(T)$, their logarithmic derivatives are identical.
