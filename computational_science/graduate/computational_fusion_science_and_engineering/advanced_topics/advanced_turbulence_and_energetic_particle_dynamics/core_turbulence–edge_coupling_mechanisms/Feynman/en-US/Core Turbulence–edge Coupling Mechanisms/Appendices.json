The wavepacket propagates with a group velocity $v_g > 0$ in the $+x$ direction. The defining characteristic of a simple one-dimensional advective system is the group velocity. Since the group velocity $v_g$ is non-zero, any disturbance that is generated is simultaneously transported, or *convected*, away from its point of origin.
