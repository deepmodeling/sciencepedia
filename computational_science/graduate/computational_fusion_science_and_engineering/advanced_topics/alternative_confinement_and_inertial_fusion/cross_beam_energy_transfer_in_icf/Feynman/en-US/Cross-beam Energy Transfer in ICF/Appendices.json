            "problem": "Two coherent Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) beams of vacuum wavelength $\\lambda_0$ cross at an angle $\\theta$ inside a homogeneous, quasi-neutral plasma representative of Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) hohlraum conditions. The electron number density is $n_e$, the ions are singly charged with mass $m_i$, and the electron and ion temperatures are $T_e$ and $T_i$, respectively. The phenomenon of Cross-Beam Energy Transfer (CBET) operates through a driven ion-acoustic wave excited by the ponderomotive beat of the two electromagnetic waves, with beat wavevector $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{k}_1 - \\mathbf{k}_2$ and beat angular frequency $\\Delta \\omega = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2$. The plasma refractive index is $n(\\omega_0) = \\sqrt{1 - \\omega_{pe}^2/\\omega_0^2}$, where $\\omega_{pe}^2 = n_e e^2/(\\epsilon_0 m_e)$ and $\\omega_0 = 2 \\pi c/\\lambda_0$.

All physical models and equations, such as the ponderomotive force, the ion-acoustic wave dispersion relation, and the concept of resonant energy transfer, are standard in plasma physics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for both the derivation and the subsequent calculation, with a clearly defined objective. The language is objective and precise. The parameters provided are realistic for hohlraum plasmas in ICF experiments. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The ancillary parameters (e.g., $\\lambda_0, \\theta, T_e$) provide physical context for the derivation, while the numerical calculation relies on a subset of simplified parameters ($\\eta, \\alpha, g_{\\mathrm{on}}, L$), a structure designed to test conceptual understanding followed by application of the derived formula. This does not render the problem trivial or contrived.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe phenomenon of cross-beam energy transfer is mediated by an ion-acoustic wave (IAW) driven by the ponderomotive force of the laser beat wave. The dynamics of the normalized electron density perturbation, $\\delta n_e / n_e$, associated with the IAW can be described by the equation for a driven, damped harmonic oscillator:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} + 2\\nu_s \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\omega_a^2 \\right) \\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e} = F_p(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_a = c_s q$ is the natural frequency of the IAW, $\\nu_s$ is its damping rate, and $F_p$ is the driving term originating from the ponderomotive force. The ponderomotive force is proportional to the gradient of the laser intensity, and its beat component oscillates at the difference frequency $\\Delta \\omega = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2$ and has a spatial structure given by the wavevector $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{k}_1 - \\mathbf{k}_2$. We consider a single Fourier mode corresponding to this beat wave, so we look for a steady-state solution of the form $\\delta n_e(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\propto \\exp[i(\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\Delta\\omega t)]$. Substituting this into the differential equation yields an algebraic equation for the complex amplitude of the density perturbation:\n$$\n\\left( -\\Delta\\omega^2 - 2i\\nu_s\\Delta\\omega + \\omega_a^2 \\right) \\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta n_e}}{n_e} \\propto \\widetilde{E_1}\\widetilde{E_2}^*\n$$\nThe complex amplitude of the driven density response is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta n_e}}{n_e} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega_a^2 - \\Delta\\omega^2 - 2i\\nu_s\\Delta\\omega}\n$$\nEnergy transfer occurs when the system is driven near resonance, i.e., $\\Delta\\omega \\approx \\omega_a$. We can simplify the denominator using this approximation. Let $\\delta = \\Delta\\omega - \\omega_a$ be the detuning from resonance.\n$$\n\\omega_a^2 - \\Delta\\omega^2 = (\\omega_a - \\Delta\\omega)(\\omega_a + \\Delta\\omega) = (-\\delta)(2\\omega_a + \\delta) \\approx -2\\omega_a\\delta\n$$\nAnd for the damping term, $2i\\nu_s\\Delta\\omega \\approx 2i\\nu_s\\omega_a$. The denominator becomes approximately $-2\\omega_a\\delta - 2i\\nu_s\\omega_a = -2\\omega_a(\\delta + i\\nu_s)$.\nThe response of the density perturbation is then:\n$$\n\\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta n_e}}{n_e} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\delta + i\\nu_s} = \\frac{\\delta - i\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2}\n$$\nThe small-signal gain coefficient $g$ for the probe beam is proportional to the rate of energy transfer from the pump beam. This energy transfer rate is maximized when the driving force does work on the plasma wave. The power transferred is proportional to the imaginary part of the plasma's susceptibility, which in turn is proportional to the imaginary part of the density response amplitude. The imaginary part represents the component of the oscillation that is in quadrature (i.e., $\\pi/2$ out of phase) with the driving force, which allows for net work to be done over a cycle.\n$$\ng \\propto -\\text{Im}\\left( \\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta n_e}}{n_e} \\right)\n$$\nThe sign convention depends on whether $\\Delta \\omega$ represents gain or loss. For gain on the lower frequency beam ($\\omega_2$), we require $\\omega_1 > \\omega_2$ and thus $\\Delta \\omega > 0$. The gain is positive.\n$$\ng \\propto -\\text{Im}\\left( \\frac{\\delta - i\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2} \\right) = -\\left( \\frac{-\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2}\n$$\nThis expression describes the resonance line shape of the gain. The gain is maximized under the phase-matching condition, which is exact resonance: $\\delta = 0$, or $\\Delta\\omega = \\omega_a$. The on-resonance gain coefficient, $g_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{on}} \\propto \\frac{\\nu_s}{0^2 + \\nu_s^2} = \\frac{1}{\\nu_s}\n$$\nWe can express the proportionality constant as $C = g_{\\mathrm{on}}\\nu_s$. Substituting this back into the expression for $g$:\n$$\ng = (g_{\\mathrm{on}}\\nu_s) \\frac{\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2} = g_{\\mathrm{on}} \\frac{\\nu_s^2}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $\\nu_s^2$, we obtain the gain coefficient in terms of its on-resonance value and the detuning-to-damping ratio:\n$$\ng = g_{\\mathrm{on}} \\frac{1}{1 + (\\delta/\\nu_s)^2}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the gain is reduced from its peak value $g_{\\mathrm{on}}$ by a Lorentzian factor, $\\left[1 + (\\delta/\\nu_s)^2\\right]^{-1}$, as the beat frequency is detuned from the natural IAW frequency. The phase-matching condition for maximum energy transfer is $\\delta = 0$, and any deviation from this, $\\delta \\neq 0$, reduces the coupling efficiency.\n\nNow, we compute the probe intensity gain factor $G(L)$ for the given parameters. The gain factor after propagating a distance $L$ is given by $G(L) = \\exp(gL)$. We first need to calculate the value of the detuned gain coefficient $g$.\n\nThe detuning is $\\delta = \\Delta\\omega - \\omega_a$. We are given $\\Delta\\omega = \\eta \\omega_a$ with $\\eta = 1.15$.\n$$\n\\delta = 1.15 \\omega_a - \\omega_a = 0.15 \\omega_a\n$$\nThe damping rate is given as $\\nu_s = \\alpha \\omega_a$, with $\\alpha = 0.30$.\n$$\n\\nu_s = 0.30 \\omega_a\n$$\nThe ratio of detuning to damping is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\nu_s} = \\frac{0.15 \\omega_a}{0.30 \\omega_a} = \\frac{0.15}{0.30} = 0.5\n$$\nNow we can calculate the gain coefficient $g$ using the given on-resonance value $g_{\\mathrm{on}} = 70 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$:\n$$\ng = g_{\\mathrm{on}} \\frac{1}{1 + (\\delta/\\nu_s)^2} = (70 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\frac{1}{1 + (0.5)^2} = 70 \\frac{1}{1 + 0.25} = 70 \\frac{1}{1.25}\n$$\n$$\ng = \\frac{70}{5/4} = 70 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 14 \\times 4 = 56 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe propagation path length is $L = 8 \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 8 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}$. The argument of the exponential is the total gain exponent, $gL$:\n$$\ngL = (56 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.448\n$$\nThe intensity gain factor $G(L)$ is therefore:\n$$\nG(L) = \\exp(gL) = \\exp(0.448)\n$$\nCalculating the value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\nG(L) \\approx 1.565153\n$$\n$$\nG(L) \\approx 1.565\n$$\nThis is a dimensionless factor representing the multiplication of the probe beam's initial intensity.",
