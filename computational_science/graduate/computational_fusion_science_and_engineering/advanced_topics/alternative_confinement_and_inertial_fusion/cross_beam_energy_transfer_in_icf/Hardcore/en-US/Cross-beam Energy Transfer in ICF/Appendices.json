            "problem": "Two coherent laser beams of vacuum wavelength $\\lambda_0$ cross at an angle $\\theta$ inside a homogeneous, quasi-neutral plasma representative of Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) hohlraum conditions. The electron number density is $n_e$, the ions are singly charged with mass $m_i$, and the electron and ion temperatures are $T_e$ and $T_i$, respectively. The phenomenon of Cross-Beam Energy Transfer (CBET) operates through a driven ion-acoustic wave excited by the ponderomotive beat of the two electromagnetic waves, with beat wavevector $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{k}_1 - \\mathbf{k}_2$ and beat angular frequency $\\Delta \\omega = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2$. The plasma refractive index is $n(\\omega_0) = \\sqrt{1 - \\omega_{pe}^2/\\omega_0^2}$, where $\\omega_{pe}^2 = n_e e^2/(\\epsilon_0 m_e)$ and $\\omega_0 = 2 \\pi c/\\lambda_0$. The ion-acoustic wave dispersion relation in the fluid limit is $\\omega_a \\approx c_s q$, with $q = |\\mathbf{q}|$ and $c_s = \\sqrt{\\left(Z k_B T_e + 3 k_B T_i\\right)/m_i}$ for isothermal electrons and adiabatic ions, where $Z$ is the ion charge state.

All physical models and equations, such as the ponderomotive force, the ion-acoustic wave dispersion relation, and the concept of resonant energy transfer, are standard in plasma physics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for both the derivation and the subsequent calculation, with a clearly defined objective. The language is objective and precise. The parameters provided are realistic for hohlraum plasmas in ICF experiments. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The ancillary parameters (e.g., $\\lambda_0, \\theta, T_e$) provide physical context for the derivation, while the numerical calculation relies on a subset of simplified parameters ($\\eta, \\alpha, g_{\\mathrm{on}}, L$), a structure designed to test conceptual understanding followed by application of the derived formula. This does not render the problem trivial or contrived.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe phenomenon of cross-beam energy transfer is mediated by an ion-acoustic wave (IAW) driven by the ponderomotive force of the laser beat wave. The dynamics of the normalized electron density perturbation, $\\delta n_e / n_e$, associated with the IAW can be described by the equation for a driven, damped harmonic oscillator:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} + 2\\nu_s \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\omega_a^2 \\right) \\frac{\\delta n_e}{n_e} = F_p(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_a = c_s q$ is the natural frequency of the IAW, $\\nu_s$ is its damping rate, and $F_p$ is the driving term originating from the ponderomotive force. The ponderomotive force is proportional to the gradient of the laser intensity, and its beat component oscillates at the difference frequency $\\Delta \\omega = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2$ and has a spatial structure given by the wavevector $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{k}_1 - \\mathbf{k}_2$. We consider a single Fourier mode corresponding to this beat wave, so we look for a steady-state solution of the form $\\delta n_e(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\propto \\exp[i(\\mathbf{q}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\Delta\\omega t)]$. Substituting this into the differential equation yields an algebraic equation for the complex amplitude of the density perturbation:\n$$\n\\left( -\\Delta\\omega^2 - 2i\\nu_s\\Delta\\omega + \\omega_a^2 \\right) \\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta n_e}}{n_e} \\propto \\widetilde{E_1}\\widetilde{E_2}^*\n$$\nThe complex amplitude of the driven density response is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta n_e}}{n_e} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega_a^2 - \\Delta\\omega^2 - 2i\\nu_s\\Delta\\omega}\n$$\nEnergy transfer occurs when the system is driven near resonance, i.e., $\\Delta\\omega \\approx \\omega_a$. We can simplify the denominator using this approximation. Let $\\delta = \\Delta\\omega - \\omega_a$ be the detuning from resonance.\n$$\n\\omega_a^2 - \\Delta\\omega^2 = (\\omega_a - \\Delta\\omega)(\\omega_a + \\Delta\\omega) = (-\\delta)(2\\omega_a + \\delta) \\approx -2\\omega_a\\delta\n$$\nAnd for the damping term, $2i\\nu_s\\Delta\\omega \\approx 2i\\nu_s\\omega_a$. The denominator becomes approximately $-2\\omega_a\\delta - 2i\\nu_s\\omega_a = -2\\omega_a(\\delta + i\\nu_s)$.\nThe response of the density perturbation is then:\n$$\n\\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta n_e}}{n_e} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\delta + i\\nu_s} = \\frac{\\delta - i\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2}\n$$\nThe small-signal gain coefficient $g$ for the probe beam is proportional to the rate of energy transfer from the pump beam. This energy transfer rate is maximized when the driving force does work on the plasma wave. The power transferred is proportional to the imaginary part of the plasma's susceptibility, which in turn is proportional to the imaginary part of the density response amplitude. The imaginary part represents the component of the oscillation that is in quadrature (i.e., $\\pi/2$ out of phase) with the driving force, which allows for net work to be done over a cycle.\n$$\ng \\propto -\\text{Im}\\left( \\frac{\\widetilde{\\delta n_e}}{n_e} \\right)\n$$\nThe sign convention depends on whether $\\Delta \\omega$ represents gain or loss. For gain on the lower frequency beam ($\\omega_2$), we require $\\omega_1 > \\omega_2$ and thus $\\Delta \\omega > 0$. The gain is positive.\n$$\ng \\propto -\\text{Im}\\left( \\frac{\\delta - i\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2} \\right) = -\\left( \\frac{-\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2}\n$$\nThis expression describes the resonance line shape of the gain. The gain is maximized under the phase-matching condition, which is exact resonance: $\\delta = 0$, or $\\Delta\\omega = \\omega_a$. The on-resonance gain coefficient, $g_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{on}} \\propto \\frac{\\nu_s}{0^2 + \\nu_s^2} = \\frac{1}{\\nu_s}\n$$\nWe can express the proportionality constant as $C = g_{\\mathrm{on}}\\nu_s$. Substituting this back into the expression for $g$:\n$$\ng = (g_{\\mathrm{on}}\\nu_s) \\frac{\\nu_s}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2} = g_{\\mathrm{on}} \\frac{\\nu_s^2}{\\delta^2 + \\nu_s^2}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $\\nu_s^2$, we obtain the gain coefficient in terms of its on-resonance value and the detuning-to-damping ratio:\n$$\ng = g_{\\mathrm{on}} \\frac{1}{1 + (\\delta/\\nu_s)^2}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the gain is reduced from its peak value $g_{\\mathrm{on}}$ by a Lorentzian factor, $\\left[1 + (\\delta/\\nu_s)^2\\right]^{-1}$, as the beat frequency is detuned from the natural IAW frequency. The phase-matching condition for maximum energy transfer is $\\delta = 0$, and any deviation from this, $\\delta \\neq 0$, reduces the coupling efficiency.\n\nNow, we compute the probe intensity gain factor $G(L)$ for the given parameters. The gain factor after propagating a distance $L$ is given by $G(L) = \\exp(gL)$. We first need to calculate the value of the detuned gain coefficient $g$.\n\nThe detuning is $\\delta = \\Delta\\omega - \\omega_a$. We are given $\\Delta\\omega = \\eta \\omega_a$ with $\\eta = 1.15$.\n$$\n\\delta = 1.15 \\omega_a - \\omega_a = 0.15 \\omega_a\n$$\nThe damping rate is given as $\\nu_s = \\alpha \\omega_a$, with $\\alpha = 0.30$.\n$$\n\\nu_s = 0.30 \\omega_a\n$$\nThe ratio of detuning to damping is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta}{\\nu_s} = \\frac{0.15 \\omega_a}{0.30 \\omega_a} = \\frac{0.15}{0.30} = 0.5\n$$\nNow we can calculate the gain coefficient $g$ using the given on-resonance value $g_{\\mathrm{on}} = 70 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$:\n$$\ng = g_{\\mathrm{on}} \\frac{1}{1 + (\\delta/\\nu_s)^2} = (70 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\frac{1}{1 + (0.5)^2} = 70 \\frac{1}{1 + 0.25} = 70 \\frac{1}{1.25}\n$$\n$$\ng = \\frac{70}{5/4} = 70 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 14 \\times 4 = 56 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe propagation path length is $L = 8 \\,\\mathrm{mm} = 8 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}$. The argument of the exponential is the total gain exponent, $gL$:\n$$\ngL = (56 \\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (8 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.448\n$$\nThe intensity gain factor $G(L)$ is therefore:\n$$\nG(L) = \\exp(gL) = \\exp(0.448)\n$$\nCalculating the value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\nG(L) \\approx 1.565153\n$$\n$$\nG(L) \\approx 1.565\n$$\nThis is a dimensionless factor representing the multiplication of the probe beam's initial intensity.",

The hohlraum symmetry is represented by a low-mode Legendre component $P_2$ that arises from differential weighting of inner and outer cone drive on the capsule. The objective is to compute time-dependent commanded powers for the inner and outer cones that maintain drive balance (defined as zero $P_2$ under the nominal CBET transfer function), and then assess the residual low-mode error when the CBET transfer function is uncertain within specified bounds.\n\nFundamental base and assumptions:\n- Laser power is conserved during cross-beam energy transfer, which is expressed as a linear redistribution of launched power.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in a simplified but standard model of cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) in inertial confinement fusion, is well-posed with all necessary data and constraints provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The solution proceeds as follows.\n\nThe objective is to compute the root-mean-square (RMS) of the worst-case normalized low-mode asymmetry, $R$, over a laser pulse, subject to uncertainties in the CBET model. This requires a two-step process for each time sample $t_k$: first, determine the optimal commanded powers for the inner and outer cones to achieve drive balance under nominal conditions; second, use these commanded powers to evaluate the maximum possible asymmetry given the bounded uncertainty in the CBET.\n\n### Part 1: Determination of Commanded Laser Powers\n\nAt any given time $t$, the total commanded power $S(t)$ is split between the inner cone, $P_i^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$, and the outer cone, $P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$, such that $P_i^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) + P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) = S(t)$. The physically admissible range for the commanded outer cone power is $P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) \\in [0, S(t)]$.\n\nThe first task is to select $P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$ to nullify the low-mode drive asymmetry, represented by the Legendre moment $A_2(t)$, under the nominal CBET transfer function $T(t)$. The moment $A_2(t)$ is given by:\n$$\nA_2(t) = \\alpha_i\\,P_i^{\\mathrm{del}}(t) + \\alpha_o\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{del}}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for delivered powers, $P_i^{\\mathrm{del}}(t) = P_i^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) + T(t)\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$ and $P_o^{\\mathrm{del}}(t) = (1 - T(t))\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$, we get:\n$$\nA_2(t) = \\alpha_i \\left( P_i^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) + T(t)\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) \\right) + \\alpha_o \\left( (1 - T(t))\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the power conservation constraint $P_i^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) = S(t) - P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$:\n$$\nA_2(t) = \\alpha_i \\left( S(t) - P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) + T(t)\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) \\right) + \\alpha_o \\left( (1 - T(t))\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) \\right)\n$$\nTo find the dependence on $P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$, we rearrange the terms:\n$$\nA_2(t) = \\alpha_i S(t) + P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) \\left[ (\\alpha_o - \\alpha_i)(1 - T(t)) \\right]\n$$\nSetting $A_2(t) = 0$ to find the ideal commanded outer cone power, denoted $P_{o, \\text{ideal}}^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$, yields:\n$$\nP_{o, \\text{ideal}}^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) = \\frac{- \\alpha_i S(t)}{(\\alpha_o - \\alpha_i)(1 - T(t))} = \\frac{\\alpha_i S(t)}{(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_o)(1 - T(t))}\n$$\nThis expression is valid provided the denominator is non-zero, which holds for all test cases as $\\alpha_i \\neq \\alpha_o$ and $T(t)  1$.\n\nThe calculated $P_{o, \\text{ideal}}^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$ may lie outside the physically admissible range $[0, S(t)]$. As $A_2(t)$ is a linear function of $P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$, if the ideal value is outside the interval $[0, S(t)]$, the minimum of $|A_2(t)|$ on this interval will occur at the boundary endpoint closest to the ideal value. This is precisely what a clipping operation achieves. Therefore, the commanded outer cone power is determined by:\n$$\nP_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) = \\text{clip}\\left( P_{o, \\text{ideal}}^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t),\\, 0,\\, S(t) \\right)\n$$\nOnce $P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$ is determined for each time sample, $P_i^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$ is found via $P_i^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) = S(t) - P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)$.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of Worst-Case Normalized Residual\n\nWith the time-dependent commanded powers established, we now assess the impact of uncertainty in the CBET. The actual transfer function is unknown but lies within the bounds $[T(t) - \\Delta T(t), T(t) + \\Delta T(t)]$, clipped to $[0, 1]$. The extremal transfer functions are:\n$$\nT_-(t) = \\max\\{0,\\, T(t) - \\Delta T(t)\\}\n$$\n$$\nT_+(t) = \\min\\{1,\\, T(t) + \\Delta T(t)\\}\n$$\nThe normalized residual is a function of the actual transfer function, $T_{\\text{actual}}(t)$. For a given $T_{\\text{actual}}(t)$, the delivered powers are:\n$$\nP_i^{\\mathrm{del}}(t; T_{\\text{actual}}) = P_i^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t) + T_{\\text{actual}}(t)\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_o^{\\mathrm{del}}(t; T_{\\text{actual}}) = (1 - T_{\\text{actual}}(t))\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{cmd}}(t)\n$$\nThe corresponding asymmetry $A_2$ and total flux $F$ are:\n$$\nA_2(t; T_{\\text{actual}}) = \\alpha_i\\,P_i^{\\mathrm{del}}(t; T_{\\text{actual}}) + \\alpha_o\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{del}}(t; T_{\\text{actual}})\n$$\n$$\nF(t; T_{\\text{actual}}) = \\beta_i\\,P_i^{\\mathrm{del}}(t; T_{\\text{actual}}) + \\beta_o\\,P_o^{\\mathrm{del}}(t; T_{\\text{actual}})\n$$\nSince $A_2$ and $F$ are linear in $T_{\\text{actual}}$, the ratio $|A_2/F|$ will have its extrema at the boundaries of the interval for $T_{\\text{actual}}$, which are $T_-(t)$ and $T_+(t)$. The instantaneous worst-case normalized residual $r(t)$ is thus the maximum of the absolute residuals evaluated at these two extremal transfer functions:\n$$\nr(t) = \\max\\left\\{ \\left|\\frac{A_2(t;T_-(t))}{F(t;T_-(t))}\\right|,\\, \\left|\\frac{A_2(t;T_+(t))}{F(t;T_+(t))}\\right| \\right\\}\n$$\nA small non-zero value for the denominator $F(t)$ is assumed, which is physically reasonable as it represents total flux.\n\n### Part 3: Aggregate RMS Residual\n\nFinally, the overall performance metric $R$ is the root-mean-square (RMS) of the instantaneous worst-case residuals $r(t_k)$ over all $N$ time samples in the pulse:\n$$\nR = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=1}^{N} r(t_k)^2}\n$$\nThis quantity provides a single figure-of-merit for the robustness of the power-balancing strategy against CBET uncertainty. The algorithm implements this procedure for each test case.",
