            "problem": "A neutral deuterium atom moving in the edge of a fusion plasma is simulated using Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC), where the next event time is drawn from an exponential distribution with rate parameter (hazard) given by the collision frequency. From kinetic theory, the collision frequency for binary encounters may be written in terms of the target ion number density, energy-dependent cross section, and relative speed. Consider deuterium charge-exchange with deuterium ions of number density $n_{i} = 7.5 \\times 10^{19}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The energy-dependent cross section is described by $\\sigma(E) = \\sigma_{0}\\left(E/E_{0}\\right)^{1/2}$, where $\\sigma_{0} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ and $E_{0} = 1\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.

We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe rate parameter $\\lambda$ for a collision event in a Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulation is equivalent to the total collision frequency. For binary encounters between a test particle and a population of target particles, the collision frequency is given by the expression:\n$$ \\lambda = n_{\\text{target}} \\langle \\sigma v_{\\text{rel}} \\rangle $$\nwhere $n_{\\text{target}}$ is the number density of the target particles, $\\sigma$ is the collision cross section, $v_{\\text{rel}}$ is the relative speed between the colliding particles, and the angle brackets $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ denote an average over the velocity distributions of both populations.\n\nThe problem specifies a monoenergetic neutral deuterium atom, which means its speed is fixed. It also provides the simplifying assumption that the relative speed equals the neutral's speed, $v_{\\text{rel}} = v$. This is equivalent to assuming a stationary target of deuterium ions.

The problem is objective and free of ambiguity for the given inputs.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe fundamental principle of kinetic Monte Carlo for particle transport is that the optical depth traversed by a particle over a free-flight path is sampled from an exponential probability distribution. The cumulative distribution function for optical depth $\\tau$ is $P(\\tau' < \\tau) = 1 - \\exp(-\\tau)$. Using inverse transform sampling with a uniform random variate $R \\in (0,1)$, we set $R = P(\\tau' < \\tau)$, which gives $R = 1 - \\exp(-\\tau)$ and leads to the prescribed relation $\\tau = -\\ln(1-R)$. Since $R$ is a uniform random variate on $(0,1)$, $1-R$ is also a uniform random variate on $(0,1)$. Therefore, for sampling purposes, we can use $\\tau = -\\ln(R)$.\n\nFor the given random variate $R=0.5$, the sampled optical depth to the next collision is:\n$$ \\tau = -\\ln(0.5) = -(\\ln(2^{-1})) = \\ln(2) $$\nThe value of the optical depth is approximately $\\tau \\approx 0.6931$.\n\nThe optical depth is also defined as the integral of the macroscopic collision coefficient $\\nu(x)$ along the particle's path, from its starting point $x_0$ to the collision point $x_{\\mathrm{coll}} = x_0 + s$:\n$$ \\tau = \\int_{x_0}^{x_0+s} \\nu(x') \\, dx' $$\n\nThe particle starts at $x_0 = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$ in Region 1, where $\\nu(x) = \\nu_1 = 20\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$. It travels towards positive $x$. We must first determine if the collision occurs in Region 1 or if the particle crosses the interface at $x = L_1 = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{m}$ to enter Region 2.\n\nTo do this, we calculate the optical depth required to reach the interface, $\\tau_{\\text{interface}}$. The path length to the interface is $s_1 = L_1 - x_0$.\n$$ s_1 = 0.06\\,\\mathrm{m} - 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe optical depth to traverse this path in Region 1 is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{interface}} = \\int_{x_0}^{L_1} \\nu_1 \\, dx' = \\nu_1 (L_1 - x_0) = \\nu_1 s_1 $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{interface}} = (20\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) \\times (0.04\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.8 $$\n\nWe now compare the sampled optical depth $\\tau$ with the optical depth to the interface $\\tau_{\\text{interface}}$:\n$$ \\tau = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931 $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{interface}} = 0.8 $$\nSince $\\tau < \\tau_{\\text{interface}}$, the particle does not have sufficient \"optical path\" to reach the interface. Therefore, the collision occurs within Region 1.\n\nFor a collision within Region 1, the flight distance $s$ is determined by the equation:\n$$ \\tau = \\int_{x_0}^{x_0+s} \\nu_1 \\, dx' = \\nu_1 s $$\nSolving for $s$:\n$$ s = \\frac{\\tau}{\\nu_1} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\nu_1} $$\nThe position of the collision is then:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{coll}} = x_0 + s = x_0 + \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\nu_1} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{coll}} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m} + \\frac{\\ln(2)}{20\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}} $$\nUsing the approximation $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{coll}} \\approx 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m} + \\frac{0.693147}{20}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m} + 0.034657\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{coll}} \\approx 0.054657\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Counting from the first non-zero digit in 0.054657, the four significant figures are 5, 4, 6, and 5. The next digit is 7, so we round up the last significant digit.\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{coll}} \\approx 0.05466\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThis position is within Region 1 ($x \\in [0, 0.06\\,\\mathrm{m}]$), which is consistent with our finding that the collision occurs before the interface.",
