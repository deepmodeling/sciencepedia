## Introduction
The [kinetic theory of plasmas](@entry_id:187918) provides the most fundamental description of systems of charged particles, a regime crucial for understanding phenomena in fusion energy science and astrophysics. For hot, diffuse plasmas where particle interactions are dominated by long-range collective fields, the governing equation is the collisionless Vlasov equation. Accurately solving this high-dimensional partial differential equation presents a formidable computational challenge. Grid-based Eulerian solvers address this by discretizing the entire phase space on a fixed grid, offering a powerful, deterministic approach that avoids the statistical noise inherent in [particle-based methods](@entry_id:753189).

This article provides a comprehensive overview of grid-based Eulerian Vlasov solvers, guiding the reader from first principles to advanced applications. The first chapter, **"Principles and Mechanisms,"** delves into the theoretical foundation of the Vlasov-Poisson system and explores the core numerical algorithms used to solve it, from operator splitting and [advection schemes](@entry_id:1120842) to techniques for preserving conservation laws and positivity. The second chapter, **"Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections,"** demonstrates how these solvers are used to verify physical theories, examines their relationship to other models like Particle-in-Cell and gyrokinetics, and highlights their application to frontier problems in fusion energy. Finally, the **"Hands-On Practices"** section offers practical exercises to solidify understanding of key concepts, from calculating macroscopic moments to building and verifying a basic solver. Through this structured exploration, you will gain a robust understanding of the theory, implementation, and application of this essential tool in [computational plasma physics](@entry_id:198820).

## Principles and Mechanisms

### The Vlasov-Poisson System: A Continuum Description

The [kinetic theory of plasmas](@entry_id:187918) describes the evolution of a system of charged particles not as a fluid, but in terms of a statistical distribution function in phase space. For a [collisionless plasma](@entry_id:191924), where particle interactions are dominated by long-range, collective electromagnetic fields rather than short-range binary collisions, the governing equation for the [single-particle distribution function](@entry_id:150211), $f(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{v}, t)$, is the Vlasov equation. This chapter focuses on the electrostatic case in one spatial dimension and one velocity dimension (1D-1V), where the Vlasov equation takes the form:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + \frac{q}{m} E(x,t) \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = 0
$$
Here, $f(x,v,t)$ represents the density of particles in the two-dimensional phase space $(x,v)$ at time $t$. The constants $q$ and $m$ are the charge and mass of the particle species under consideration, and $E(x,t)$ is the self-consistent electric field.

This equation is fundamentally different from the Boltzmann equation, which includes an additional term, the **collision operator** $C[f]$, on the right-hand side. The Boltzmann equation, $\frac{Df}{Dt} = C[f]$, models the change in the distribution function due to short-range, discrete [particle scattering](@entry_id:152941). The Vlasov equation is precisely the limit of the Boltzmann equation where collisions are neglected ($C[f]=0$). This collisionless approximation is valid for phenomena occurring on timescales much shorter than the average time between [particle collisions](@entry_id:160531), a common regime in hot, diffuse fusion plasmas. 

The Vlasov equation can be derived from the $N$-particle Liouville equation through the Bogoliubov–Born–Green–Kirkwood–Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy by applying a **[mean-field approximation](@entry_id:144121)**. This approximation truncates the hierarchy by assuming that two-particle correlations are negligible, meaning particles only interact with a smooth, average electric field generated by the entire distribution, rather than with individual neighboring particles. The equation itself states that the [total time derivative](@entry_id:172646) of $f$ along a particle's trajectory in phase space is zero, $\frac{df}{dt} = 0$. This implies that the value of the distribution function is constant along the **characteristics** of the equation, which are simply the paths of individual particles governed by the equations of motion:
$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = v, \qquad \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{q}{m} E(x,t)
$$
A crucial consequence of this Hamiltonian structure is that the flow in phase space is incompressible. The divergence of the phase-[space velocity](@entry_id:190294) field, $\mathbf{u} = (v, qE/m)$, is $\nabla_{(x,v)} \cdot \mathbf{u} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (qE/m)}{\partial v} = 0$, a restatement of Liouville's theorem. 

While the distribution function provides a complete microscopic description, macroscopic physical quantities are recovered by taking **velocity-space moments** of $f$. The fundamental definition of $f(x,v,t)$ is that the number of particles in an infinitesimal phase-space volume $dx\,dv$ is $f(x,v,t)\,dx\,dv$. By integrating over all velocities at a fixed position $x$, we obtain the macroscopic properties of the plasma at that point.  The three most important moments are:

-   **Particle Density** ($n(x,t)$): The number of particles per unit volume, obtained by integrating $f$ over all velocities (the zeroth moment).
    $$
    n(x,t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x,v,t)\,dv
    $$

-   **Bulk Flow Velocity** ($u(x,t)$): The [average velocity](@entry_id:267649) of the particles, obtained by normalizing the first velocity moment of $f$ by the density.
    $$
    u(x,t) = \frac{1}{n(x,t)} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} v f(x,v,t)\,dv
    $$

-   **Temperature** ($T(x,t)$): A measure of the thermal spread, or random kinetic energy, of the particles. It is defined from the [second central moment](@entry_id:200758) (the variance) of the velocity distribution. The random, or peculiar, velocity of a particle is $w = v - u(x,t)$. The temperature is given by:
    $$
    T(x,t) = \frac{m}{k_B n(x,t)} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (v-u(x,t))^2 f(x,v,t)\,dv
    $$
    where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

To illustrate these concepts, consider a distribution function representing two counter-streaming ion beams, a situation relevant to the **[two-stream instability](@entry_id:138430)**. At a specific point in space and time, let the distribution be $f(v) = \frac{n_0}{2} [f_+(v) + f_-(v)]$, where each beam $f_\pm(v)$ is a Maxwellian with [thermal velocity](@entry_id:755900) $v_t = \sqrt{k_B T_0/m}$ and drift velocity $\pm u_0$. Calculating the moments shows that the total density is $n=n_0$, the net bulk flow is $u=0$, and the [total temperature](@entry_id:1133272) is $T = T_0 + \frac{m u_0^2}{k_B}$. This demonstrates that the kinetic energy of the counter-[streaming motion](@entry_id:184094) contributes to the overall temperature (velocity variance) of the combined system. 

The system is closed by the **Poisson equation**, which provides the self-consistent link between the particles and the field they generate. The charge density $\rho(x,t)$ is computed from the particle density (assuming a fixed, neutralizing [background charge](@entry_id:142591) density $\rho_{bg}$), and Gauss's law in one dimension relates this to the electric field:
$$
\rho(x,t) = q n(x,t) + \rho_{bg}, \qquad \frac{\partial E}{\partial x} = \frac{\rho(x,t)}{\epsilon_0}
$$
The Vlasov and Poisson equations together form a closed, [nonlinear system](@entry_id:162704). The distribution $f$ determines the charge density $\rho$, which in turn determines the electric field $E$ via Poisson's equation. This field then acts back on the particles, governing the evolution of $f$ through the Vlasov equation. This self-consistent feedback loop is the source of all collective plasma phenomena. 

For an [isolated system](@entry_id:142067) with [periodic boundary conditions](@entry_id:147809), this Vlasov-Poisson system conserves several global quantities. The most important are the total number of particles (mass), total momentum, and total energy. The **total energy** is the sum of the total particle kinetic energy and the energy stored in the [electrostatic field](@entry_id:268546):
$$
H = \frac{m}{2}\int_0^L \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} v^2 f\,dv\,dx + \frac{\epsilon_0}{2}\int_0^L E^2\,dx
$$
The conservation of these quantities is a fundamental property of the physics, and preserving them in a numerical simulation is a key indicator of a high-fidelity solver. 

### The Eulerian Discretization Approach

Numerically solving the Vlasov-Poisson system requires a discretization strategy. The two dominant paradigms are Lagrangian and Eulerian. The Lagrangian **Particle-in-Cell (PIC)** method represents the distribution function as a collection of macro-particles that are moved along the characteristic trajectories. In contrast, a **grid-based Eulerian solver** discretizes the phase space $(x,v)$ itself onto a fixed grid. The value of the distribution function $f$ is stored at each grid point (or as a cell-average) and is evolved by solving the Vlasov equation as a partial differential equation (PDE) on this grid.

A key distinction between these methods lies in their error properties. Since the PIC method uses a finite number of particles $N_p$ to sample the [continuous distribution](@entry_id:261698), its estimates of moments (like charge density) are subject to statistical **sampling noise**. This noise typically scales as $N_p^{-1/2}$ and can be a limiting factor in resolving low-amplitude phenomena. Eulerian solvers, being deterministic PDE solvers, are inherently **noise-free**; their errors arise from truncation (due to finite grid spacing and time steps) and round-off, not statistical fluctuations. 

The primary challenge for Eulerian Vlasov solvers is **phase-space filamentation**. The Vlasov dynamics, being a shear flow in an incompressible phase space, naturally stretches any initial volume of particles into long, thin filaments. As time progresses, the width of these filaments continually decreases. For example, in a simple free-streaming scenario, velocity gradients can grow linearly in time, meaning the characteristic scale of variations in $f$ shrinks as $1/t$. 

An Eulerian grid has a fixed resolution, defined by the grid spacings $\Delta x$ and $\Delta v$. Eventually, the physical filaments will become thinner than the grid cells. At this point, the solver can no longer resolve the fine structure of the distribution function. This under-resolution leads to numerical errors that manifest as **numerical diffusion** or aliasing. This process is effectively a form of **coarse-graining**, where the unresolved fine-scale information is lost. This loss of information is an irreversible process that leads to an artificial increase in the system's numerically computed Boltzmann entropy, $S = -\int f \ln f \,dx\,dv$. While the exact Vlasov equation conserves $S$, any practical Eulerian solver will show a slow entropy growth due to this numerical dissipation. Conceptually, the truncation error of the numerical scheme acts like an effective [diffusion operator](@entry_id:136699) added to the Vlasov equation, which becomes significant when gradients are large and drives the increase in entropy.  

### Numerical Algorithms for Time Advancement

Advancing the distribution function $f_{i,j}^n \approx f(x_i, v_j, t^n)$ from one time step to the next is the core of an Eulerian solver. The Vlasov equation is a multi-dimensional [advection equation](@entry_id:144869), and a powerful technique for solving it is **operator splitting**. This approach decomposes the full [evolution operator](@entry_id:182628) into a sequence of simpler, lower-dimensional advection problems that are solved sequentially. The 1D-1V Vlasov equation can be split into an advection in space and an advection in velocity:
$$
\text{Step A (x-advection): } \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0
$$
$$
\text{Step B (v-advection): } \frac{\partial f}{\partial t} + \frac{qE}{m} \frac{\partial f}{\partial v} = 0
$$

Let $\Phi_A^{\tau}$ and $\Phi_B^{\tau}$ be the exact solution operators for these subproblems over a time $\tau$. A simple way to combine them is the first-order **Lie-Trotter splitting**, $f^{n+1} = \Phi_A^{\Delta t} \Phi_B^{\Delta t} f^n$. However, a much more accurate method is the second-order **Strang splitting**, which uses a symmetric composition:
$$
f^{n+1} = \Phi_A^{\Delta t/2} \Phi_B^{\Delta t} \Phi_A^{\Delta t/2} f^n \quad \text{or} \quad f^{n+1} = \Phi_B^{\Delta t/2} \Phi_A^{\Delta t} \Phi_B^{\Delta t/2} f^n
$$
This symmetric "half-step, full-step, half-step" sequence cancels the leading error term, resulting in a scheme that is second-order accurate in $\Delta t$. This is a standard and robust technique for Vlasov solvers. 

The remaining task is to solve the one-dimensional advection subproblems, such as $\partial_t u + \partial_x (au) = 0$. Two common approaches are [finite-volume methods](@entry_id:749372) and semi-Lagrangian methods.

#### Finite-Volume Methods

A **finite-volume method** evolves cell-averaged values of the distribution function. Integrating the conservation law over a cell $[x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}]$ gives an update formula that depends on the **numerical flux**, $\widehat{F}$, at the cell interfaces:
$$
f_i^{n+1} = f_i^n - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} (\widehat{F}_{i+1/2} - \widehat{F}_{i-1/2})
$$
The challenge is to define a suitable flux function. A foundational approach is Godunov's method, where the flux is determined by the solution to the **Riemann problem** at the interface—a miniature advection problem with the cell-average values to the left ($u_L$) and right ($u_R$) as initial data. For [linear advection](@entry_id:636928), the solution is a contact wave traveling at speed $a$. The flux at the interface is simply the physical flux $au$ evaluated using the state that propagates to the interface location. This naturally leads to the **first-order [upwind flux](@entry_id:143931)**:
$$
\widehat{F}(u_L, u_R) = \begin{cases} a u_L  &\text{if } a > 0 \\ a u_R  &\text{if } a  0 \end{cases}
$$
This can be written in a single expression as $\widehat{F} = \frac{1}{2} a (u_L + u_R) - \frac{1}{2} |a| (u_R - u_L)$, where the second term is a numerical dissipation term. This scheme is stable provided the **Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition** is met: the Courant number $C = |a| \Delta t / \Delta x$ must be less than or equal to one. This condition has a clear physical meaning: information must not travel more than one grid cell in a single time step. A key property of the upwind scheme under this condition is that it is **monotonicity-preserving**, meaning it will not create new spurious oscillations in the solution. 

#### Semi-Lagrangian Methods

An alternative to solving the PDE in its Eulerian form is the **semi-Lagrangian method**. This method directly uses the fact that $f$ is conserved along characteristics. To find the value of $f$ at a grid point $(x_i, v_j)$ at the new time $t^{n+1}$, we trace the characteristic curve backward in time by $\Delta t$ to find its **departure point**, $(x_d, v_d)$, at time $t^n$. The new value is then set to the value of the distribution at that departure point:
$$
f(x_i, v_j, t^{n+1}) = f(x_d, v_d, t^n)
$$
A first-order accurate estimate for the departure point is found by integrating the characteristic equations backward: $(x_d, v_d) \approx (x_i - v_j \Delta t, v_j - \frac{q}{m}E(x_i, t^n) \Delta t)$. Since $(x_d, v_d)$ will generally not fall on a grid point, the value $f(x_d, v_d, t^n)$ must be found by **interpolating** the known grid values of $f^n$. 

The primary advantage of the semi-Lagrangian method is its stability. As long as the interpolation scheme is stable (e.g., linear interpolation), the method is **[unconditionally stable](@entry_id:146281)** with respect to the CFL condition. The time step $\Delta t$ is limited by accuracy requirements, not stability, which can allow for much larger time steps than explicit finite-volume or [finite-difference schemes](@entry_id:749361). 

### The Self-Consistent Field Solve

At each time step, after updating the distribution function (or in the middle of a split step), the electric field must be re-calculated from the new charge density. In a system with [periodic boundary conditions](@entry_id:147809) on a domain of length $L$, this is most efficiently and accurately accomplished using **[spectral methods](@entry_id:141737)** based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).

We represent the [periodic functions](@entry_id:139337) $\rho(x)$ and $E(x)$ by their Fourier series:
$$
\rho(x) = \sum_n \hat{\rho}_n e^{i k_n x}, \qquad E(x) = \sum_n \hat{E}_n e^{i k_n x}
$$
where $k_n = 2\pi n / L$ is the wavenumber. Substituting these into Poisson's equation, $\partial E / \partial x = \rho / \epsilon_0$, turns the differential equation into an algebraic one for the Fourier coefficients:
$$
i k_n \hat{E}_n = \frac{\hat{\rho}_n}{\epsilon_0}
$$
For all non-zero wavenumbers ($n \neq 0, k_n \neq 0$), we can solve directly for the field coefficients:
$$
\hat{E}_n = \frac{\hat{\rho}_n}{i k_n \epsilon_0}
$$
The procedure is then: (1) Compute $\rho(x)$ from $f(x,v,t)$ on the grid. (2) Use an FFT to compute its Fourier coefficients $\hat{\rho}_n$. (3) Apply the algebraic relation above to find $\hat{E}_n$. (4) Use an inverse FFT to transform $\hat{E}_n$ back to the [real-space](@entry_id:754128) field $E(x)$. 

A special consideration is the **zero mode** ($n=0$, $k_0=0$). For this mode, the spectral relation becomes $0 = \hat{\rho}_0 / \epsilon_0$, which imposes a physical consistency constraint: the average charge density, $\hat{\rho}_0 = \frac{1}{L} \int_0^L \rho(x)\,dx$, must be zero. This condition of **global charge neutrality** is required for a periodic electrostatic solution to exist. If this condition is met, the equation gives no information about $\hat{E}_0$, the spatial average of the electric field. In simulations, it is standard practice to set $\hat{E}_0 = 0$, which corresponds to working in a frame with no net external field or bulk [plasma drift](@entry_id:1129779). 

### Advanced Topics in Eulerian Solvers

#### Conservation Properties of Numerical Schemes

As established, the continuous Vlasov-Poisson system conserves total mass, momentum, and energy. A crucial goal in designing high-fidelity numerical solvers is to construct discrete algorithms that preserve these invariants at the numerical level. A scheme that uses **conservative flux differencing** (as in the [finite-volume method](@entry_id:167786)) naturally conserves the discrete total mass, $\sum_i \sum_j f_{i,j} \Delta x \Delta v$. Conserving momentum and energy is more challenging and requires careful design. Schemes built with operators that satisfy a discrete analogue of integration-by-parts, known as the **Summation-by-Parts (SBP)** property, can be shown to exactly conserve discrete versions of the total momentum and energy. The use of such [structure-preserving algorithms](@entry_id:755563) is essential for long-term simulation accuracy and stability, preventing unphysical drifts in conserved quantities. 

#### Preserving Positivity

The distribution function $f$ is a probability density and must therefore be non-negative. While a first-order upwind scheme naturally preserves positivity, [higher-order schemes](@entry_id:150564), which are needed for accuracy, can introduce [spurious oscillations](@entry_id:152404) that lead to negative values of $f$. This is unphysical and can cause simulations to crash. To remedy this, **[positivity-preserving limiters](@entry_id:753610)** are employed. These techniques work by blending a high-order, but potentially oscillatory, flux ($F^H$) with a robust, non-oscillatory low-order flux like upwind ($F^L$). The blended flux is $\widehat{F} = \theta F^H + (1-\theta) F^L$, where $\theta \in [0,1]$ is a limiting parameter. A limiter algorithm computes the most aggressive value of $\theta$ (closest to 1) that can be used everywhere on the grid while guaranteeing that the updated solution, $f_i^{n+1}$, will be non-negative in every cell. This allows the scheme to be as high-order as possible in smooth regions while gracefully falling back to a more robust scheme near sharp gradients or emerging undershoots, thus maintaining both accuracy and physical [realizability](@entry_id:193701).
