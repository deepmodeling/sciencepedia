            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of an elastic binary collision between a light projectile (mass $m_1$, initial velocity $\\mathbf{v}_1$) and a heavy, stationary target (mass $m_2$, initial velocity $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{0}$). We will work from first principles: conservation of energy and momentum, and the transformation between the laboratory (lab) and center-of-mass (CM) frames.\n\nFirst, we define the velocity of the center of mass, $\\mathbf{v}_{cm}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{cm} = \\frac{m_1 \\mathbf{v}_1 + m_2 \\mathbf{v}_2}{m_1 + m_2}\n$$\nSince the target is initially at rest, $\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{0}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{cm} = \\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \\mathbf{v}_1\n$$\nNext, we determine the initial velocities of the projectile, $\\mathbf{u}_1$, and the target, $\\mathbf{u}_2$, in the CM frame:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}_1 = \\mathbf{v}_1 - \\mathbf{v}_{cm} = \\mathbf{v}_1 - \\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \\mathbf{v}_1\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}_2 = \\mathbf{v}_2 - \\mathbf{v}_{cm} = \\mathbf{0} - \\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \\mathbf{v}_1 = -\\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \\mathbf{v}_1\n$$\nIn an elastic collision, kinetic energy is conserved. In the CM frame, this implies that the magnitudes of the velocities of the particles are unchanged by the collision. The only effect of the collision is to rotate their velocity vectors. Let the post-collision velocities in the CM frame be $\\mathbf{u}_1'$ and $\\mathbf{u}_2'$. Then:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{u}_1'| = |\\mathbf{u}_1| = \\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} |\\mathbf{v}_1|\n$$\n$$\n|\\mathbf{u}_2'| = |\\mathbf{u}_2| = \\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} |\\mathbf{v}_1|\n$$\nThe CM scattering angle, $\\chi$, is defined as the angle between the initial and final velocity vectors of the projectile in the CM frame, i.e., the angle between $\\mathbf{u}_1$ and $\\mathbf{u}_1'$.\n\nTo find the projectile's final kinetic energy in the lab frame, $E_1'$, we must first find its final lab-frame velocity, $\\mathbf{v}_1'$. We do this by transforming $\\mathbf{u}_1'$ back to the lab frame:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_1' = \\mathbf{u}_1' + \\mathbf{v}_{cm}\n$$\nThe final kinetic energy is $E_1' = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1'|^2$. We compute the square of the magnitude:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{v}_1'|^2 = \\mathbf{v}_1' \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1' = (\\mathbf{u}_1' + \\mathbf{v}_{cm}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{u}_1' + \\mathbf{v}_{cm}) = |\\mathbf{u}_1'|^2 + |\\mathbf{v}_{cm}|^2 + 2 \\mathbf{u}_1' \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{cm}\n$$\nWe can express each term using the initial lab velocity $|\\mathbf{v}_1|$ and the masses.\n$|\\mathbf{u}_1'|^2 = |\\mathbf{u}_1|^2 = \\left(\\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\\right)^2 |\\mathbf{v}_1|^2$.\n$|\\mathbf{v}_{cm}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\\right)^2 |\\mathbf{v}_1|^2$.\nFor the dot product, note that $\\mathbf{v}_{cm}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{v}_1$, and $\\mathbf{u}_1$ is also parallel to $\\mathbf{v}_1$. Therefore, the angle between $\\mathbf{u}_1'$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{cm}$ is the same as the angle between $\\mathbf{u}_1'$ and $\\mathbf{u}_1$, which is $\\chi$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}_1' \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{cm} = |\\mathbf{u}_1'| |\\mathbf{v}_{cm}| \\cos(\\chi) = \\left(\\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2} |\\mathbf{v}_1|\\right) \\left(\\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2} |\\mathbf{v}_1|\\right) \\cos(\\chi) = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} |\\mathbf{v}_1|^2 \\cos(\\chi)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $|\\mathbf{v}_1'|^2$:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{v}_1'|^2 = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{m_1}{m_1 + m_2}\\right)^2 + 2 \\frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} \\cos(\\chi) \\right] |\\mathbf{v}_1|^2\n$$\n$$\n|\\mathbf{v}_1'|^2 = \\frac{m_2^2 + m_1^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 \\cos(\\chi)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2} |\\mathbf{v}_1|^2\n$$\nThe ratio of the final to initial kinetic energy, $E_1'/E_1$, where $E_1 = \\frac{1}{2} m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1|^2$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{E_1'}{E_1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1'|^2}{\\frac{1}{2} m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1|^2} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{v}_1'|^2}{|\\mathbf{v}_1|^2} = \\frac{m_1^2 + m_2^2 + 2 m_1 m_2 \\cos(\\chi)}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}\n$$\nThis is the exact expression for the energy ratio, completing the first task.\n\nFor the second task, we analyze this ratio in the limit $m_1/m_2 \\to 0$. Let $\\mu = m_1/m_2$. We rewrite the ratio by dividing the numerator and denominator by $m_2^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_1'}{E_1} = \\frac{(m_1/m_2)^2 + 1 + 2(m_1/m_2)\\cos(\\chi)}{((m_1/m_2) + 1)^2} = \\frac{1 + 2\\mu \\cos(\\chi) + \\mu^2}{(1 + \\mu)^2}\n$$\nWe perform a Taylor expansion for small $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\frac{E_1'}{E_1} = (1 + 2\\mu \\cos(\\chi) + \\mu^2)(1 + \\mu)^{-2} \\approx (1 + 2\\mu \\cos(\\chi))(1 - 2\\mu + O(\\mu^2))\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{E_1'}{E_1} \\approx 1 - 2\\mu + 2\\mu \\cos(\\chi) + O(\\mu^2) = 1 - 2\\mu(1 - \\cos(\\chi)) + O(\\mu^2)\n$$\nThe fractional projectile energy loss is $\\Delta E_1/E_1 = 1 - E_1'/E_1$. To leading nontrivial order in $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta E_1}{E_1} \\approx 2\\mu(1 - \\cos(\\chi)) = 2 \\frac{m_1}{m_2}(1 - \\cos(\\chi))\n$$\nThis result shows that the fractional energy loss scales linearly with the mass ratio $m_1/m_2$.\n\nFor the third task, we compute the average of this fractional energy loss. The problem states that scattering is isotropic in the CM frame. This means the probability of scattering into any solid angle element $d\\Omega = \\sin(\\chi) d\\chi d\\phi$ is uniform. The average of a function $f(\\chi)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\langle f(\\chi) \\rangle = \\frac{\\int_{\\Omega} f(\\chi) d\\Omega}{\\int_{\\Omega} d\\Omega} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\phi \\int_0^\\pi f(\\chi) \\sin(\\chi) d\\chi = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\pi f(\\chi) \\sin(\\chi) d\\chi\n$$\nWe need to compute the average of the leading-order fractional energy loss:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\Delta E_1}{E_1} \\right\\rangle \\approx \\left\\langle 2 \\frac{m_1}{m_2} (1 - \\cos(\\chi)) \\right\\rangle = 2 \\frac{m_1}{m_2} \\langle 1 - \\cos(\\chi) \\rangle\n$$\nThe average term is:\n$$\n\\langle 1 - \\cos(\\chi) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\pi (1 - \\cos(\\chi)) \\sin(\\chi) d\\chi\n$$\nLet $w = \\cos(\\chi)$, so $dw = -\\sin(\\chi) d\\chi$. The limits of integration become $w=1$ to $w=-1$.\n$$\n\\langle 1 - \\cos(\\chi) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_1^{-1} (1-w)(-dw) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} (1-w) dw = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ w - \\frac{w^2}{2} \\right]_{-1}^1\n$$\n$$\n\\langle 1 - \\cos(\\chi) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(-1 - \\frac{(-1)^2}{2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} [2] = 1\n$$\nThus, the average leading-order fractional energy loss is:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\Delta E_1}{E_1} \\right\\rangle \\approx 2 \\frac{m_1}{m_2}\n$$\nThe final expression requested by the problem is this one. The interpretation is that for a light particle scattering isotropically off a heavy target, the average fractional energy lost per collision is small, scaling as twice the mass ratio.\n\nFor completeness, we address the final task: momentum transfer. The momentum transferred to the target, $\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_2$, is equal to the change in the projectile's momentum, but with opposite sign, due to conservation of total momentum ($\\mathbf{p}_1 + \\mathbf{p}_2 = \\mathbf{p}_1' + \\mathbf{p}_2'$).\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_2 = \\mathbf{p}_2' - \\mathbf{p}_2 = \\mathbf{p}_2' = -(\\mathbf{p}_1' - \\mathbf{p}_1) = -\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_1\n$$\nThe change in the projectile's momentum is most easily calculated in the CM frame, as $\\mathbf{v}_1' - \\mathbf{v}_1 = \\mathbf{u}_1' - \\mathbf{u}_1$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{p}_1 = m_1(\\mathbf{v}_1' - \\mathbf{v}_1) = m_1(\\mathbf{u}_1' - \\mathbf{u}_1)\n$$\nThe magnitude of the transferred momentum is $|\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_2| = |\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_1| = m_1 |\\mathbf{u}_1' - \\mathbf{u}_1|$. We find the square of this magnitude:\n$$\n|\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_2|^2 = m_1^2 (|\\mathbf{u}_1'|^2 + |\\mathbf{u}_1|^2 - 2 \\mathbf{u}_1' \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_1) = m_1^2 (2|\\mathbf{u}_1|^2 - 2|\\mathbf{u}_1|^2 \\cos\\chi) = 2m_1^2 |\\mathbf{u}_1|^2 (1-\\cos\\chi)\n$$\nSubstituting $|\\mathbf{u}_1| = \\frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2} |\\mathbf{v}_1|$:\n$$\n|\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_2|^2 = 2 m_1^2 \\left(\\frac{m_2}{m_1+m_2}\\right)^2 |\\mathbf{v}_1|^2 (1-\\cos\\chi)\n$$\nTaking the square root and using $\\mu = m_1/m_2$:\n$$\n|\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_2| = \\sqrt{2} m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1| \\frac{1}{1+\\mu} \\sqrt{1-\\cos\\chi}\n$$\nIn the limit $\\mu \\to 0$, we have $\\frac{1}{1+\\mu} \\approx 1$. The leading-order scaling is:\n$$\n|\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_2| \\approx \\sqrt{2} m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1| \\sqrt{1-\\cos\\chi} = (m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1|) \\sqrt{2(1-\\cos\\chi)}\n$$\nUsing the identity $1-\\cos\\chi = 2\\sin^2(\\chi/2)$:\n$$\n|\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_2| \\approx (m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1|) \\sqrt{4\\sin^2(\\chi/2)} = 2 (m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1|) \\sin(\\chi/2)\n$$\nLet $p_1 = m_1 |\\mathbf{v}_1|$ be the initial projectile momentum magnitude. Then $|\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_2| \\approx 2 p_1 \\sin(\\chi/2)$.\nThe scaling of momentum transfer is of order $p_1$, i.e., $O(\\mu^0)$, which is of the same order of magnitude as the projectile's initial momentum.\n\nComparison: The fractional energy transfer scales as $\\Delta E_1/E_1 \\propto m_1/m_2$, which is very small for $m_1 \\ll m_2$. In contrast, the momentum transfer $|\\Delta\\mathbf{p}_2|$ is on the order of the projectile's initial momentum $p_1$. This signifies that while the projectile loses very little of its energy, it can undergo a significant change in its direction of motion, transferring a substantial amount of momentum to the massive target. This is physically intuitive, like a billiard ball bouncing off a rail: its speed is nearly unchanged, but its momentum vector changes direction significantly.",

The probabilities for $k=0$ and $k=1$ are:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(N=0) = \\frac{(\\lambda_{\\max})^0}{0!} \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\max}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\max})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(N=1) = \\frac{(\\lambda_{\\max})^1}{1!} \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\max}) = \\lambda_{\\max} \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\max})\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathbb{P}(N \\geq 2)$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(N \\geq 2) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\max}) - \\lambda_{\\max} \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\max})\n$$\nThe condition is $\\mathbb{P}(N \\geq 2) \\leq \\epsilon$. Since $\\epsilon \\ll 1$, this implies that $\\Delta t$ must be small, and consequently $\\lambda_{\\max}$ must also be small ($\\lambda_{\\max} \\ll 1$). We can therefore use a Taylor series expansion of the exponential function $\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\max})$ around $\\lambda_{\\max} = 0$:\n$$\n\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\max}) = 1 - \\lambda_{\\max} + \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}^2}{2!} - \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}^3}{3!} + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda_{\\max}^4)\n$$\nSubstituting this expansion into the probability expression gives:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(N \\geq 2) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\lambda_{\\max} + \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}^2}{2} - \\dots \\right) - \\lambda_{\\max} \\left(1 - \\lambda_{\\max} + \\dots \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(N \\geq 2) = 1 - 1 + \\lambda_{\\max} - \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}^2}{2} - \\lambda_{\\max} + \\lambda_{\\max}^2 + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda_{\\max}^3)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(N \\geq 2) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}^2}{2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\lambda_{\\max}^3)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the leading-order expression. Thus, we approximate the condition $\\mathbb{P}(N \\geq 2) \\leq \\epsilon$ by its leading-order term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}^2}{2} \\leq \\epsilon\n$$\nSubstituting back $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\nu_{\\max} \\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\nu_{\\max} \\Delta t)^2}{2} \\leq \\epsilon\n$$\nWe are looking for the largest allowable timestep, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, which corresponds to the equality:\n$$\n(\\nu_{\\max} \\Delta t_{\\max})^2 = 2\\epsilon\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t_{\\max}$ gives the desired constraint:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max}(\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}}{\\nu_{\\max}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Fractional Bias in Expected Energy Decrement**\n\nThe fractional bias, $b$, is defined as:\n$$\nb = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{Poisson}}[\\Delta E_{\\text{step}}] - \\mathbb{E}_{\\text{algo}}[\\Delta E_{\\text{step}}]}{\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{Poisson}}[\\Delta E_{\\text{step}}]}\n$$\nThe energy decrement in a single timestep, $\\Delta E_{\\text{step}}$, is the product of the number of collisions $N$ in that step and the constant energy loss per collision, $\\Delta E$. Therefore, the expected energy decrement is $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta E_{\\text{step}}] = \\mathbb{E}[N \\cdot \\Delta E] = \\Delta E \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[N]$.\n\nFor the exact Poisson process with rate $\\nu$, the expected number of collisions in an interval $\\Delta t$ is the mean of the Poisson distribution, which is $\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\text{Poisson}}] = \\nu \\Delta t$. The exact expected energy decrement is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{Poisson}}[\\Delta E_{\\text{step}}] = \\Delta E \\cdot (\\nu \\Delta t)\n$$\nFor the numerical algorithm, the number of collisions in a timestep, $N_{\\text{algo}}$, is restricted to be either $0$ or $1$. The event of a collision ($N_{\\text{algo}}=1$) occurs with probability $p(v) = 1 - \\exp(-\\nu \\Delta t)$, which is the Poisson probability of at least one event. The event of no collision ($N_{\\text{algo}}=0$) occurs with probability $1-p(v) = \\exp(-\\nu \\Delta t)$. Thus, $N_{\\text{algo}}$ is a Bernoulli random variable. The expected number of collisions for the algorithm is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N_{\\text{algo}}] = 1 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(N_{\\text{algo}}=1) + 0 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(N_{\\text{algo}}=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\nu \\Delta t)\n$$\nThe expected energy decrement for the algorithm is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{algo}}[\\Delta E_{\\text{step}}] = \\Delta E \\cdot (1 - \\exp(-\\nu \\Delta t))\n$$\nNow, we can compute the fractional bias. The constant factor $\\Delta E$ cancels out:\n$$\nb = \\frac{\\nu \\Delta t - (1 - \\exp(-\\nu \\Delta t))}{\\nu \\Delta t}\n$$\nThe problem requires this to be expressed as a function of the dimensionless timestep $\\lambda = \\nu \\Delta t$. Substituting $\\lambda$ into the expression yields:\n$$\nb(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda - (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda))}{\\lambda} = 1 - \\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis expression quantifies the fractional bias. The algorithm systematically underestimates the collision frequency by truncating the possibility of multiple collisions, leading to a positive bias (underestimation of energy loss).\n\nThe two requested quantities are $\\Delta t_{\\max}(\\epsilon)$ and $b(\\lambda)$.",
