A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe intensity $I_{k \\rightarrow j}$ of a spectral line resulting from a transition from an upper level $k$ to a lower level $j$ is proportional to the population density of the upper level, $n_k$, and the spontaneous radiative decay rate for that transition, $A_{kj}$:\n$$I_{k \\rightarrow j} = n_k A_{kj} h\\nu_{kj}$$\nwhere $h\\nu_{kj}$ is the energy of the emitted photon.\n\nThe line intensity ratio $R$ is defined as $R \\equiv I_f/I_i$. Based on the definition of line intensity, and letting the ground state be denoted by $g$:\n$$R = \\frac{I_{f \\rightarrow g}}{I_{i \\rightarrow g}} = \\frac{n_f A_f h\\nu_f}{n_i A_i h\\nu_i}$$\nGiven the assumption that $h\\nu_f \\approx h\\nu_i$, the photon energy terms cancel, simplifying the ratio to:\n$$R = \\frac{n_f A_f}{n_i A_i}$$\nTo proceed, we need the population ratio $n_f/n_i$ under two different limiting physical conditions: Coronal Equilibrium (CE) and Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).\n\n**1. Derivation for Coronal Equilibrium (CE)**\n\nIn the CE model for these excited states, we construct steady-state rate balance equations. The key processes populating and depopulating levels $f$ and $i$ are:\n- Electron-impact excitation from the ground state $g$ to level $f$ (rate: $n_g n_e C_{gf}$). We are told to neglect direct excitation to level $i$.\n- Spontaneous radiative decay to ground: from $f$ (rate: $n_f A_f$) and from $i$ (rate: $n_i A_i$).\n- Electron-impact collisional mixing between levels $f$ and $i$: $f \\leftrightarrow i$. The forward rate from $f$ to $i$ is $n_f n_e q_{fi}$, and the reverse (de-excitation) rate from $i$ to $f$ is $n_i n_e q_{if}$.\n\nThe steady-state rate equation for the population of level $i$, $n_i$, balances the rates of population and depopulation:\n$$ \\frac{dn_i}{dt} = (\\text{population rate}) - (\\text{depopulation rate}) = 0 $$\n$$ n_f n_e q_{fi} = n_i (A_i + n_e q_{if}) $$\nThis equation directly yields the population ratio $n_f/n_i$:\n$$ \\frac{n_f}{n_i} = \\frac{A_i + n_e q_{if}}{n_e q_{fi}} $$\nThe rate coefficient for collisional de-excitation, $q_{if}$, is related to the excitation rate coefficient, $q_{fi}$, by the principle of detailed balance:\n$$ g_f q_{fi} = g_i q_{if} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nwhich gives:\n$$ q_{if} = q_{fi} \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the population ratio into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R_{CE} = \\frac{A_f}{A_i} \\left( \\frac{A_i + n_e q_{if}}{n_e q_{fi}} \\right) = \\frac{A_f}{A_i} \\left( \\frac{A_i}{n_e q_{fi}} + \\frac{q_{if}}{q_{fi}} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $q_{if}/q_{fi}$:\n$$ R_{CE} = \\frac{A_f}{A_i} \\left( \\frac{A_i}{n_e q_{fi}} + \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis is the general expression for the line ratio $R$ in the coronal model framework.\n\n**2. Derivation for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)**\n\nIn LTE, collisional processes dominate radiative processes to such an extent that the relative populations of excited states are governed by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$ \\frac{n_i}{n_f} = \\frac{g_i}{g_f} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this population ratio into the expression for $R$:\n$$ R_{LTE} = \\frac{n_f A_f}{n_i A_i} = \\frac{A_f}{A_i} \\left(\\frac{n_f}{n_i}\\right) = \\frac{A_f}{A_i} \\left( \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) \\right) $$\n\n**3. Qualitative Comparison**\n\n-   **Coronal Equilibrium ($R_{CE}$):** The expression $R_{CE} = \\frac{A_f}{n_e q_{fi}} + \\frac{A_f}{A_i} \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right)$ shows a clear dependence on the electron density $n_e$.\n    -   In the low-density limit ($n_e \\rightarrow 0$), the first term $\\frac{A_f}{n_e q_{fi}}$ dominates, and $R_{CE} \\rightarrow \\infty$. Physically, at low density, collisional mixing is inefficient, and the metastable level $f$ must depopulate primarily via its very slow radiative decay, causing its population to build up significantly relative to level $i$.\n    -   In the high-density limit ($n_e \\rightarrow \\infty$), the first term vanishes, and $R_{CE}$ approaches a constant value: $\\lim_{n_e \\to \\infty} R_{CE} = \\frac{A_f}{A_i} \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right)$.\n-   **Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium ($R_{LTE}$):** The expression for $R_{LTE}$ is independent of electron density $n_e$.\n-   **Connection:** The high-density limit of the coronal model ($R_{CE}$) is identical to the LTE prediction ($R_{LTE}$). This is expected, as at sufficiently high densities, collisional rates become much faster than radiative rates, forcing the level populations into a Boltzmann distribution characteristic of LTE. The sensitivity of $R_{CE}$ to $n_e$ in the intermediate density regime is what makes this line ratio a valuable plasma diagnostic.\n\n**4. Calculation of Electron Density for $R=1$**\n\nWe are asked to find the electron density $n_e$ at which the CE-predicted ratio $R_{CE}$ equals $1$.\n$$ 1 = \\frac{A_f}{A_i} \\left( \\frac{A_i}{n_e q_{fi}} + \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) \\right) $$\nSolving for $n_e$:\n$$ \\frac{A_i}{A_f} = \\frac{A_i}{n_e q_{fi}} + \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{A_i}{n_e q_{fi}} = \\frac{A_i}{A_f} - \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\n$$ n_e = \\frac{A_i}{q_{fi}} \\left( \\frac{A_i}{A_f} - \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) \\right)^{-1} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $A_f = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $A_i = 3.0\\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $q_{fi} = 2.0\\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $g_f/g_i = 3/3 = 1$\n-   $(E_i - E_f) / (k_B T_e) = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{eV} / 200\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 0.002$\n\nLet's evaluate the terms in the denominator of the expression for $n_e$:\n-   $\\frac{A_i}{A_f} = \\frac{3.0\\times 10^{8}}{0.36} = 8.333...\\times 10^{8}$\n-   $\\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) = 1 \\times \\exp(0.002) \\approx 1.002002$\n\nThe term $\\frac{A_i}{A_f}$ is vastly larger than the exponential term. The expression in the parentheses is approximately $8.333 \\times 10^8$.\nThis suggests a simpler form of the expression is highly accurate. Let's rewrite the equation for $n_e$ as:\n$$ n_e = \\frac{A_f}{q_{fi} \\left( 1 - \\frac{A_f}{A_i} \\frac{g_f}{g_i} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_i - E_f}{k_B T_e}\\right) \\right)} $$\nThe term in the denominator is $1 - (\\frac{0.36}{3.0 \\times 10^8}) \\times \\exp(0.002) = 1 - (1.2 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 1.002... \\approx 1 - 1.202 \\times 10^{-9}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of atomic physics and plasma spectroscopy, specifically concerning coronal equilibrium, which is a standard and well-understood approximation for low-density, high-temperature plasmas. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, data, and constants to compute a unique solution. The language is objective and the structure is logical. The task represents a standard cross-validation and benchmarking procedure common in computational fusion science and engineering.\n\nThe solution is approached by systematically implementing the calculations for three key quantities: the energy consistency error $\\delta_E$, the FAC-based photon emissivity coefficient $PEC^{\\mathrm{FAC}}(T_e)$, and the PEC cross-validation error $\\delta_{\\mathrm{PEC}}$. The procedure is applied to each test case.\n\nThe methodology is as follows:\n\n1.  **Energy Consistency Check**: The photon energy from the FAC-like atomic structure data, $E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_{\\mathrm{ph}}$, is computed as the difference between the upper and lower energy levels involved in the transition, $E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_{\\mathrm{ph}} = E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_j - E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_i$. This is then compared to the experimentally measured value from the NIST database, $E^{\\mathrm{NIST}}_{\\mathrm{ph}}$, via the relative difference $\\delta_E$:\n    $$ \\delta_E = \\frac{\\left|E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_{\\mathrm{ph}} - E^{\\mathrm{NIST}}_{\\mathrm{ph}}\\right|}{E^{\\mathrm{NIST}}_{\\mathrm{ph}}} $$\n\n2.  **Radiative Branching Ratio Calculation**: The radiative branching ratio, $BR_{j\\to \\ell}$, represents the fraction of radiative decays from an excited level $j$ that proceed through a specific channel $j \\to \\ell$. It is calculated as the ratio of the spontaneous emission rate for the transition of interest, $A_{j\\to \\ell}$, to the sum of all possible spontaneous emission rates from level $j$:\n    $$ BR_{j\\to \\ell} = \\frac{A_{j\\to \\ell}}{\\sum_{k} A_{j\\to k}} $$\n    Here, the summation $\\sum_{k} A_{j\\to k}$ includes the rate $A_{j\\to \\ell}$ itself, plus the rates of all other decay channels.\n\n3.  **Excitation Rate Coefficient Calculation**: The electron impact excitation rate coefficient, $q_{ij}(T_e)$, quantifies the rate at which electrons of temperature $T_e$ cause an impurity ion to transition from a lower state $i$ to an upper state $j$. It is computed from the effective collision strength $\\Upsilon_{ij}(T_e)$ using the provided formula:\n    $$ q_{ij}(T_e) (\\mathrm{cm^3\\,s^{-1}}) = \\frac{8.629\\times 10^{-6}}{g_i}\\,\\frac{\\Upsilon_{ij}(T_e)}{\\sqrt{T_e}}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E_{ij}}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\n    where $g_i$ is the statistical weight of the lower level, $\\Delta E_{ij}$ is the excitation energy $E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_j-E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_i$ in $\\mathrm{eV}$, $T_e$ is the electron temperature in $\\mathrm{K}$, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, given as $8.617333262\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$. The result is converted to SI units ($\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$) by multiplying by $10^{-6}$.\n\n4.  **Photon Emissivity Coefficient (PEC) Calculation**: In the coronal approximation, the photon emissivity coefficient, $PEC^{\\mathrm{cor}}(T_e)$, is the product of the excitation rate coefficient and the branching ratio. The FAC-based value is thus:\n    $$ PEC^{\\mathrm{FAC}}(T_e) = q_{ij}(T_e) \\times BR_{j\\to \\ell} $$\n\n5.  **PEC Cross-Validation**: Finally, the computed $PEC^{\\mathrm{FAC}}(T_e)$ is compared against the benchmark value from the ADAS database, $PEC^{\\mathrm{ADAS}}(T_e)$, by calculating the relative difference $\\delta_{\\mathrm{PEC}}$:\n    $$ \\delta_{\\mathrm{PEC}} = \\frac{\\left|PEC^{\\mathrm{FAC}}(T_e) - PEC^{\\mathrm{ADAS}}(T_e)\\right|}{PEC^{\\mathrm{ADAS}}(T_e)} $$\n\nThe following are the step-by-step calculations for each test case.\n\n**Case 1: $\\mathrm{Fe\\;XV}$ $284.16\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ line**\n- Given: $T_e = 2.5\\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $g_i = 2$, $\\Upsilon_{ij}(T_e) = 1.2$, $E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_{i} = 0.00\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_{j} = 43.70\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $E^{\\mathrm{NIST}}_{\\mathrm{ph}} = 43.63\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $A_{j\\to \\ell} = 1.8\\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, other decays: $[0.2\\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}]$, $PEC^{\\mathrm{ADAS}}(T_e) = 2.50\\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\n1.  $E^{\\mathrm{FAC}}_{\\mathrm{ph}} = 43.70\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.00\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 43.70\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n    $\\delta_E = \\frac{|43.70 - 43.63|}{43.63} \\approx 0.0016044$.\n2.  $\\sum_{k} A_{j\\to k} = (1.8\\times 10^{9} + 0.2\\times 10^{9}) \\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 2.0\\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n    $BR_{j\\to \\ell} = \\frac{1.8\\times 10^{9}}{2.0\\times 10^{9}} = 0.9$.\n3.
