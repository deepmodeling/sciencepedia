## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the fundamental principles and mechanisms governing the deposition of neutral beams in fusion plasmas, we now turn our attention to the application of this knowledge. The utility of Neutral Beam Injection (NBI) extends far beyond its role as a simple heat source. It is a versatile and powerful tool that serves as a primary actuator for controlling plasma profiles, ensuring stability, and enabling advanced operational scenarios. This chapter explores the diverse applications of [neutral beam deposition](@entry_id:1128677), highlighting its deep interdisciplinary connections with transport modeling, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability, control theory, and advanced computational science.

### Core Functions: Plasma Heating and Fueling

The most direct application of NBI is the heating of plasma to thermonuclear temperatures. The injected high-energy neutrals are ionized and subsequently slow down via Coulomb collisions, transferring their kinetic energy to the background thermal electrons and ions. The effectiveness of this process hinges on the ability of the [neutral beam](@entry_id:752451) to penetrate the plasma and deposit its energy in the desired region, typically the hot core.

The [penetration depth](@entry_id:136478) of a [neutral beam](@entry_id:752451) is a critical design parameter, determined by the beam energy, the species of the injected neutrals, and the density of the target plasma. For a fixed beam energy, more massive particles travel at a lower velocity. According to the models for [charge exchange](@entry_id:186361) and impact ionization [cross-sections](@entry_id:168295), which often increase at lower relative velocities in the relevant energy range, heavier isotopes will have a shorter mean free path. Consequently, a deuterium beam will be attenuated more rapidly and have a shallower penetration depth than a hydrogen beam of the same energy. This trade-off is fundamental in designing NBI systems for future devices; higher beam energies are required to ensure that neutral atoms can penetrate the large, dense plasmas of a reactor to provide effective core heating .

Furthermore, it is important to distinguish between the initially injected power and the power transferred to the thermal plasma. The total energy of the fast ions is conserved and ultimately delivered to the plasma, but this transfer occurs over a finite slowing-down time. A fast ion is only considered to have "heated" the plasma once its energy has been collisionally transferred. The useful heating power is therefore the injected power minus the energy that remains in the fast-ion population, which has not yet thermalized. For a monoenergetic beam injected at energy $E_b$, the effective heating power is thus slightly less than the birth power, as the fast ions merge with the thermal bulk at an energy $E_t \approx \frac{3}{2} k_B T_i$, which is non-zero . In addition to providing energy, the deposition of beam ions also serves as a particle source, contributing to the plasma density and providing core fueling.

### Actuation and Control of Plasma Profiles

Modern fusion research treats NBI systems not merely as static heaters but as dynamic actuators capable of sculpting key plasma profiles. This capability is central to achieving high-performance and stable plasma discharges. By controlling the beam energy, injection angle, and the combination of different beamlines, operators and control systems can actively tailor the profiles of momentum, current, and heat deposition.

#### Driving Plasma Rotation and Controlling Momentum

When neutral beams are injected tangentially to the toroidal direction, they impart significant toroidal momentum to the plasma, driving it to rotate. This toroidal rotation is highly beneficial, as its shear can suppress turbulent transport and stabilize certain MHD instabilities. The calculation of NBI deposition profiles is therefore a critical input for [predictive transport modeling](@entry_id:1130121), providing the volumetric source terms for both heat, $S_Q(r)$, and toroidal angular momentum, $S_{\phi}(r)$, in the plasma transport equations. In simplified local models, these source profiles are directly proportional to the calculated fast-ion [birth rate](@entry_id:203658) profile .

In many scenarios, however, it is desirable to achieve strong [plasma heating](@entry_id:158813) without introducing a large [net torque](@entry_id:166772), which could drive the plasma to rotational limits or excite instabilities. This objective of decoupling heating from momentum input can be achieved by employing a strategic mix of beam geometries. For instance, a "balanced" injection scheme, which combines co-current and counter-current tangential beams, can deliver substantial heating power while resulting in near-zero net torque. The co-current beams inject momentum in the direction of the [plasma current](@entry_id:182365), while the counter-current beams inject it in the opposite direction, largely canceling their rotational effects. Similarly, a combination of tangential beams for core heating and near-perpendicular beams for edge heating can be used to tailor the total power deposition profile while maintaining control over the net injected torque .

The physics of torque deposition is further nuanced by fast-ion orbit effects. Co-passing and counter-passing fast ions have different orbit topologies, leading to asymmetries in their confinement. Counter-passing ions, in particular, often have orbits that make larger radial excursions and are more susceptible to prompt losses. This means that for the same injection geometry, a counter-current beam may deliver slightly less torque to the plasma than its co-current counterpart due to a lower effective absorption fraction, an effect that must be accounted for in precise torque balance calculations .

#### Shaping the Current Profile and MHD Stability

In addition to depositing heat and momentum, the directed motion of the fast ions constitutes an electrical current, a phenomenon known as Neutral Beam Current Drive (NBCD). This non-inductive [current source](@entry_id:275668) is a powerful tool for modifying the total [plasma current](@entry_id:182365) density profile, $j(r)$, and consequently the safety factor profile, $q(r)$. The ability to control the $q$-profile is paramount for avoiding or mitigating numerous MHD instabilities.

By controlling the beam tangency radius, one can choose to drive current either on-axis or off-axis. On-axis NBCD is highly efficient and peaks the current profile, which strongly reduces the central safety factor, $q(0)$. In contrast, off-axis NBCD deposits current at a finite minor radius, leaving the central current density largely unchanged while broadening the overall profile. This technique is of profound importance for creating [advanced tokamak scenarios](@entry_id:746315). By driving current off-axis, it is possible to produce a non-monotonic $q$-profile with a region of negative or "reversed" magnetic shear. Such profiles are associated with the formation of [internal transport barriers](@entry_id:750756), leading to dramatically improved plasma confinement and stability .

#### Active Shaping of Heating Profiles

Just as the current profile can be tailored, the heating profile itself can be actively shaped. While a single beam provides a peaked deposition profile, the superposition of multiple beams can create more complex and potentially more advantageous shapes. For example, by combining two or more off-axis beams with carefully chosen tangency radii, it is possible to create a broad, "flat-top" heating profile over a specific region of the plasma. Such a profile might be desirable to avoid excessively high central pressure gradients, which can trigger instabilities, while providing strong heating over a wide volume. This demonstrates the synergistic use of multiple NBI actuators to achieve a specific control objective for the plasma temperature profile, a key element of scenario development and optimization .

### Advanced Modeling and Integrated Scenarios

The applications discussed thus far rely on models of [neutral beam deposition](@entry_id:1128677) that are progressively more sophisticated. The most advanced applications of NBI involve its integration into [whole-device modeling](@entry_id:1134067) and its use in complex feedback control loops, connecting the physics of beam deposition to [high-performance computing](@entry_id:169980), stability theory, and control engineering.

#### From Local Deposition to Orbit-Following: The Role of Advanced Computation

Many introductory models of NBI deposition assume that fast ions deposit their energy and momentum at the same [magnetic flux surface](@entry_id:751622) where they are born. This is the "local deposition" or "zero-orbit-width" approximation. However, for the high-energy ions typical of NBI in modern tokamaks, this assumption is often invalid. In an [axisymmetric magnetic field](@entry_id:1121293), the [canonical toroidal angular momentum](@entry_id:747109), $P_{\phi} = m R v_{\phi} + q \Psi$, is a conserved quantity between collisions. As a newly born fast ion travels, any change in its spatial position (which changes the major radius $R$ and the poloidal flux $\Psi$) must be accompanied by a change in its toroidal velocity $v_{\phi}$. This forces the ion to execute drift orbits that have a finite radial extent, known as the Finite Orbit Width (FOW).

Consequently, a fast ion born on a flux surface $r_0$ will spend portions of its orbit on other flux surfaces, $r \neq r_0$, before it fully thermalizes. The true energy and momentum deposition profiles are therefore a nonlocal, orbit-averaged redistribution of the initial birth profile. This FOW effect typically broadens and shifts the deposition profiles, a critical detail for accurate modeling. Capturing this physics requires sophisticated computational tools, most notably **Monte Carlo orbit-following codes**. These codes track the trajectories of a large ensemble of marker particles, representing the fast-ion population, as they move through the magnetic equilibrium and undergo collisions, accumulating the deposited energy and momentum on a spatial grid . These detailed kinetic calculations provide the accurate source terms, such as the momentum source $S_M(r)$, that are then used in fluid-level transport codes to evolve the bulk plasma profiles. This represents a crucial bridge between the kinetic physics of individual particles and the fluid description of the macroscopic plasma .

#### NBI in the Loop: Controlling Energetic Particle Instabilities

The fast-ion population created by NBI is not always benign. If the fast-ion pressure gradient becomes sufficiently steep, it can resonantly excite collective instabilities known as Alfvén Eigenmodes (AEs). These wave-like modes can, in turn, enhance the transport of fast ions, ejecting them from the plasma before they have transferred their energy. This can reduce heating efficiency and, in a reactor, potentially damage [plasma-facing components](@entry_id:1129762).

This challenge opens a cutting-edge application area: using the NBI system itself to control these NBI-driven instabilities. The growth rate of an AE depends sensitively on the spatial gradient of the fast-ion population and its resonance with the mode structure, which is related to the $q$-profile. This sets up a complex, multi-objective optimization problem. One can attempt to tailor the NBI deposition profile, for example by shifting it slightly off-axis, to reduce the fast-ion pressure gradient and weaken the instability drive. However, this must be balanced against the primary goal of providing efficient core heating and the need to maintain a desirable $q$-profile. Solving such problems requires integrated modeling frameworks that combine NBI deposition models, equilibrium solvers, and stability calculations, often employing gradient-based optimization algorithms to find the best compromise solution .

#### The NBI Actuator in an Integrated Control System

Ultimately, in an operating fusion device, NBI is one of many actuators—alongside Poloidal Field (PF) coils, gas fueling systems, and Radio-Frequency (RF) antennas—that form a complete [plasma control](@entry_id:753487) system. The goal of [whole-device modeling](@entry_id:1134067) and integrated control is to coordinate these actuators to achieve and sustain a desired plasma state. This requires a control system that understands how each actuator affects the plasma, acknowledging that the system is inherently multi-input, multi-output (MIMO), with significant cross-coupling between actuators and plasma responses .

Advanced control strategies, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), rely on a "plant model" of the plasma that can predict its evolution in response to actuator commands. The physics-based models of NBI deposition discussed throughout this textbook—from [beam attenuation](@entry_id:1121488) and ionization to slowing-down kinetics—are a critical component of these predictive models . By systematically varying NBI parameters like injection angle and beam energy, it is possible to map out the achievable operational space and identify optimal strategies. This can be visualized through a Pareto front, which explicitly shows the trade-offs between competing objectives, such as maximizing deposition localization at a specific radius versus maximizing the total delivered torque. Exploring these trade-offs is fundamental to designing [robust control](@entry_id:260994) strategies and developing the integrated operational scenarios needed for future fusion power plants .
