The dielectric tensor in a coordinate system where $\\vec{B_0} = B_0 \\hat{z}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\tensor{\\epsilon} = \\begin{pmatrix} S  -iD  0 \\\\ iD  S  0 \\\\ 0  0  P \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe elements $S$, $D$, and $P$ are the Stix parameters, defined by sums over all plasma species $s$:\n$S = 1 - \\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\Omega_s^2}$, $D = \\sum_s \\frac{\\Omega_s}{\\omega} \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\Omega_s^2}$, and $P = 1 - \\sum_s \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2}$.\nHere, $\\omega_{ps} = \\sqrt{n_s Z_s^2 e^2 / (\\epsilon_0 m_s)}$ is the plasma frequency and $\\Omega_s = Z_s e B_0 / m_s$ is the cyclotron frequency for species $s$.\n\nA resonance, where the refractive index $n=ck/\\omega$ approaches infinity, occurs when the coefficient of the highest power of $n$ in the dispersion relation vanishes. For a general propagation angle $\\theta$ relative to $\\vec{B}_0$, this condition is $S \\sin^2\\theta + P \\cos^2\\theta = 0$. The Lower Hybrid resonance is specifically defined for waves propagating nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field, for which the resonance condition simplifies. In the limit of perpendicular propagation ($\\theta = \\pi/2$), the resonance condition is $S=0$.\n\nWe apply the frequency ordering for the LH regime, $\\Omega_i \\ll \\omega \\ll |\\Omega_e|$, to simplify the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = 1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\Omega_e^2} - \\sum_i \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\Omega_i^2}\n$$\nwhere the sum over $i$ includes all ion species.

The initial power entering on the first pass is given as $P_0$.\n$$P_{in,1} = P_0$$\nAccording to the problem description, during the first pass ($k=1$):\n-   The power absorbed in the core is $P_{abs,1} = a P_{in,1} = a P_0$.\n-   The power lost to edge mode conversion is $P_{loss,1} = \\mu P_{in,1} = \\mu P_0$.\n-   The power that reaches the wall is $P_{wall,1} = (1 - a - \\mu) P_{in,1} = (1 - a - \\mu) P_0$.\n\nOf the power that reaches the wall, a fraction $r_w$ is reflected. This reflected power becomes the input power for the second pass ($k=2$).\n$$P_{in,2} = r_w P_{wall,1} = r_w (1 - a - \\mu) P_0$$\nThe power absorbed during the second pass is then:\n$$P_{abs,2} = a P_{in,2} = a [r_w (1 - a - \\mu)] P_0$$\nWe can establish a general recurrence relation for the power entering the plasma on pass $k$. The power entering on pass $k$ is the power reflected after pass $k-1$.\n$$P_{in,k} = r_w P_{wall,k-1} = r_w (1 - a - \\mu) P_{in,k-1}$$\nThis is a geometric progression.

To find the location of such a point, we differentiate the entire turning point equation with respect to $\\theta$, remembering to apply the chain rule for $r_t(\\theta)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\left( N_{0}^{2}\\,\\bigl[1-\\beta\\,(r_{t}/a)^{2}\\bigr]\\bigl[1+\\epsilon\\cos\\theta\\bigr] - N_{\\theta}^{2} - N_{\\phi}^{2} \\right) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}(0)$$\nApplying the product rule to the first term gives:\n$$N_{0}^{2} \\left( \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\bigl[1-\\beta\\,(r_{t}/a)^{2}\\bigr] \\cdot \\bigl[1+\\epsilon\\cos\\theta\\bigr] + \\bigl[1-\\beta\\,(r_{t}/a)^{2}\\bigr] \\cdot \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\bigl[1+\\epsilon\\cos\\theta\\bigr] \\right) = 0$$\nPerforming the differentiations, and noting that $d/d\\theta [1 - \\beta(r_t/a)^2] = -\\beta(2r_t/a^2)(\\partial r_t / \\partial \\theta)$, we get:\n$$N_{0}^{2} \\left( \\left[-\\frac{2\\beta r_{t}}{a^{2}}\\frac{\\partial r_{t}}{\\partial \\theta}\\right] \\bigl[1+\\epsilon\\cos\\theta\\bigr] + \\bigl[1-\\beta\\,(r_{t}/a)^{2}\\bigr] \\bigl[-\\epsilon\\sin\\theta\\bigr] \\right) = 0$$\nThe condition for a caustic is $\\partial r_t / \\partial \\theta = 0$. Substituting this into the differentiated equation causes the first term within the parentheses to vanish:\n$$N_{0}^{2} \\left( 0 - \\epsilon\\sin\\theta \\bigl[1-\\beta\\,(r_{t}/a)^{2}\\bigr] \\right) = 0$$\nFor this equation to hold, given that $N_0 \\neq 0$, $\\epsilon \\neq 0$ (as per $0  \\epsilon  1$), and the term $1-\\beta(r_t/a)^2$ is non-zero away from the specific radius where the core profile factor vanishes, we must have $\\sin\\theta = 0$. This condition is satisfied at the poloidal angles $\\theta_c = 0$ (the low-field side, or outboard midplane) and $\\theta_c = \\pi$ (the high-field side, or inboard midplane).\n\nThe problem specifically asks for the low-field-side caustic radius, $r_c$, which corresponds to the caustic location at $\\theta_c = 0$. To find this radius, we substitute $\\theta=0$ and $r_t=r_c$ back into the original, undifferentiated turning point equation:\n$$N_{0}^{2}\\,\\bigl[1-\\beta\\,(r_{c}/a)^{2}\\bigr]\\bigl[1+\\epsilon\\cos(0)\\bigr] - N_{\\theta}^{2} - N_{\\phi}^{2} = 0$$\nKnowing that $\\cos(0) = 1$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$N_{0}^{2}\\,\\bigl[1-\\beta\\,(r_{c}/a)^{2}\\bigr](1+\\epsilon) = N_{\\theta}^{2} + N_{\\phi}^{2}$$\nWe can now algebraically solve for $r_c$. First, isolate the term containing $r_c$:\n$$1-\\beta\\,\\frac{r_{c}^{2}}{a^{2}} = \\frac{N_{\\theta}^{2} + N_{\\phi}^{2}}{N_{0}^{2}(1+\\epsilon)}$$\nNext, rearrange to solve for $r_c^2$:\n$$\\beta\\,\\frac{r_{c}^{2}}{a^{2}} = 1 - \\frac{N_{\\theta}^{2} + N_{\\phi}^{2}}{N_{0}^{2}(1+\\epsilon)}$$\n$$r_{c}^{2} = \\frac{a^{2}}{\\beta} \\left( 1 - \\frac{N_{\\theta}^{2} + N_{\\phi}^{2}}{N_{0}^{2}(1+\\epsilon)} \\right)$$\nFinally, taking the square root gives the explicit expression for the caustic radius. As a physical radius, $r_c$ must be positive.\n$$r_{c} = a \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\left( 1 - \\frac{N_{\\theta}^{2} + N_{\\phi}^{2}}{N_{0}^{2}(1+\\epsilon)} \\right)}$$\n\nRegarding the physical consequences, in WKB theory, the wave amplitude $A$ is related to the conservation of energy flux along a ray tube. The power transmitted through a ray tube of cross-sectional area $\\mathcal{A}$ is constant, leading to the relation $|A|^2 \\propto (v_g \\mathcal{A})^{-1}$, where $v_g$ is the group velocity. The ray-tube area $\\mathcal{A}$ is given by the Jacobian of the transformation from initial ray coordinates to spatial position. A caustic is a surface where adjacent rays in a family merge, causing the ray-tube area $\\mathcal{A}$ to approach zero. As a result, the Jacobian vanishes at a caustic.\n\nAccording to the simple WKB formulation, the wave amplitude $|A|$ would diverge to infinity as $\\mathcal{A} \\to 0$. This singularity indicates a breakdown of the simple WKB approximation. A more advanced analysis (e.g., using a phase-integral method that yields an Airy function solution) shows that the wave amplitude remains finite but achieves a very large maximum value just on the propagating side of the caustic, before decaying exponentially into the non-propagating region ($N_r^2  0$).\n\nThis pronounced increase in wave amplitude has a direct impact on power deposition. The rate of power absorbed by the plasma particles is generally proportional to the square of the local wave electric field, $|E|^2$, which is in turn proportional to the WKB amplitude squared, $|A|^2$. Therefore, the focusing of wave energy at the caustic creates a narrow region of greatly enhanced wave fields. This leads to a highly localized and significantly increased rate of power deposition near the caustic radius $r_c$. In the context of fusion research, such caustics are critical as they can be exploited to precisely target and control plasma heating and current drive profiles. The radius $r_c$ represents a natural focusing location for wave power on the low-field side of the tokamak.",
