The rate of momentum input from the waves, $\\dot{\\mathcal{P}}_{\\parallel, \\mathrm{wave}}$, is related to the absorbed wave power $P_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ through the parallel phase velocity of the wave $v_{\\parallel}$, which is fixed by the LH spectrum. This relationship stems from the Manley-Rowe relations and is given by:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{abs}} = v_{\\parallel} \\dot{\\mathcal{P}}_{\\parallel, \\mathrm{wave}}\n$$\nThus, the rate of momentum input is $\\dot{\\mathcal{P}}_{\\parallel, \\mathrm{wave}} = P_{\\mathrm{abs}} / v_{\\parallel}$.\n\nThe total parallel momentum of the current-carrying electron tail, $\\mathcal{P}_{\\parallel}$, is lost at a rate determined by the momentum-loss collision frequency, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{mom}}$. The rate of momentum loss is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathcal{P}}_{\\parallel, \\mathrm{coll}} = \\nu_{\\mathrm{mom}} \\mathcal{P}_{\\parallel}\n$$\nIn steady state, $\\dot{\\mathcal{P}}_{\\parallel, \\mathrm{wave}} = \\dot{\\mathcal{P}}_{\\parallel, \\mathrm{coll}}$, which gives:\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{abs}}}{v_{\\parallel}} = \\nu_{\\mathrm{mom}} \\mathcal{P}_{\\parallel}\n$$\nThe driven current $I_{\\mathrm{CD}}$ is directly proportional to the net momentum of the tail electrons, $\\mathcal{P}_{\\parallel}$. Let $I_{\\mathrm{CD}} = k \\mathcal{P}_{\\parallel}$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality involving the electron charge and mass. Substituting $\\mathcal{P}_{\\parallel} = I_{\\mathrm{CD}}/k$:\n$$\n\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{abs}}}{v_{\\parallel}} = \\nu_{\\mathrm{mom}} \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CD}}}{k}\n$$\nRearranging for the efficiency $\\eta = I_{\\mathrm{CD}} / P_{\\mathrm{abs}}$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{CD}}}{P_{\\mathrm{abs}}} = \\frac{k}{v_{\\parallel} \\nu_{\\mathrm{mom}}}\n$$\nSince the LH wave spectrum is fixed, $v_{\\parallel}$ is constant. The factor $k$ is also a constant. Therefore, the efficiency scales inversely with the momentum-loss frequency:\n$$\n\\eta \\propto \\frac{1}{\\nu_{\\mathrm{mom}}}\n$$\nFor high-energy electrons, momentum is lost primarily through pitch-angle scattering events that change the direction of the electron's velocity vector. The momentum-loss frequency $\\nu_{\\mathrm{mom}}$ is therefore the pitch-angle scattering frequency, $\\nu_{PAS}$.\n$$\n\\nu_{\\mathrm{mom}} \\approx \\nu_{PAS}\n$$\nPitch-angle scattering occurs due to collisions with both ions and other electrons.

So, $\\nu_{PAS, \\mathrm{ei}} \\propto n_{e} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n-   The e-e pitch-angle scattering frequency (fast electrons on bulk electrons) is $\\nu_{PAS, \\mathrm{ee}} \\propto n_{e} Z_{e}^{2} = n_e (1)^2 = n_e$.\n\nCombining these, the total pitch-angle scattering frequency has the dependence:\n$$\n\\nu_{PAS} \\propto n_{e} Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} + n_{e} = n_{e} (Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} + 1)\n$$\nThis is consistent with the problem which states that the e-i contribution, scaling with $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the \"primary\" one for $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}  1$. Our derivation retains the e-e contribution as it is a fundamental physical process not forbidden by the problem statement.\n\nThe problem specifies that $n_e$ and $T_e$ are fixed. The underlying velocity dependence of the collision frequencies (typically $v^{-3}$) is absorbed into a constant of proportionality because the resonant velocity $v_{\\parallel}$ is also fixed. Hence, the scaling of the momentum-loss frequency with $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is:\n$$\n\\nu_{\\mathrm{mom}} \\propto (Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} + 1)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the scaling for efficiency:\n$$\n\\eta \\propto \\frac{1}{Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} + 1}\n$$\nThis is the derived dependence of the current-drive efficiency on $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ under the specified conditions.\n\n**Calculation of the Degradation Ratio**\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $\\eta(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}=3) / \\eta(Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}=1.5)$.

It is scientifically grounded in established cold plasma theory, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated objectively. The parameters are physically realistic for a burning plasma experiment.\n\n### Step 1: Ion Number Densities\nFirst, we determine the number densities of the ion species as a function of the helium ash fraction $x$. The plasma is composed of electrons (e), deuterium ions (D), tritium ions (T), and helium ions (He).\nThe quasi-neutrality condition requires that the total charge density is zero, which means the electron number density equals the total positive ion charge density:\n$$n_{e} = \\sum_{i} n_{i} Z_{i} = n_{\\mathrm{D}} Z_{\\mathrm{D}} + n_{\\mathrm{T}} Z_{\\mathrm{T}} + n_{\\mathrm{He}} Z_{\\mathrm{He}}$$\nSubstituting the given charge numbers $Z_{\\mathrm{D}} = 1$, $Z_{\\mathrm{T}} = 1$, and $Z_{\\mathrm{He}} = 2$:\n$$n_{e} = n_{\\mathrm{D}} (1) + n_{\\mathrm{T}} (1) + n_{\\mathrm{He}} (2)$$\nWe are given the constraints $n_{\\mathrm{D}} = n_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{He}} = x n_{e}$. Substituting these into the quasi-neutrality equation:\n$$n_{e} = n_{\\mathrm{D}} + n_{\\mathrm{D}} + (x n_{e}) (2) = 2 n_{\\mathrm{D}} + 2 x n_{e}$$\nNow, we solve for $n_{\\mathrm{D}}$ in terms of $n_{e}$ and $x$:\n$$2 n_{\\mathrm{D}} = n_{e} - 2 x n_{e} = n_{e} (1 - 2x)$$\n$$n_{\\mathrm{D}} = n_{e} \\frac{1 - 2x}{2}$$\nSince $n_{\\mathrm{D}} = n_{\\mathrm{T}}$, we have:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{T}} = n_{e} \\frac{1 - 2x}{2}$$\n\n### Step 2: Lower Hybrid Resonance Frequency\nThe lower hybrid resonance occurs for perpendicular propagation ($\\mathbf{k} \\perp \\mathbf{B}$) when the dielectric tensor component $S = \\epsilon_{xx} = 0$. In the Stix notation, for a multi-species plasma, this component is:\n$$S = 1 - \\sum_{s} \\frac{\\omega_{ps}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\omega_{cs}^2} = 0$$\nThe sum is over all species (electrons and ions). We separate the electron and ion contributions:\n$$1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\omega_{ce}^2} - \\sum_{i} \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2 - \\omega_{ci}^2} = 0$$\nWe apply the frequency ordering for lower hybrid waves, $\\omega_{ci} \\ll \\omega \\ll \\omega_{ce}$:\n- For the electron term, $\\omega^2 \\ll \\omega_{ce}^2$, so $\\omega^2 - \\omega_{ce}^2 \\approx -\\omega_{ce}^2$.\n- For the ion terms, $\\omega_{ci}^2 \\ll \\omega^2$, so $\\omega^2 - \\omega_{ci}^2 \\approx \\omega^2$.\nSubstituting these approximations into the resonance condition:\n$$1 - \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{-\\omega_{ce}^2} - \\sum_{i} \\frac{\\omega_{pi}^2}{\\omega^2} \\approx 0$$\n$$1 + \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega_{ce}^2} = \\frac{1}{\\omega^2} \\sum_{i} \\omega_{pi}^2$$\nSolving for $\\omega^2$, we obtain the square of the lower hybrid resonance frequency, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2$:\n$$\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\omega_{pi}^2}{1 + \\frac{\\omega_{pe}^2}{\\omega_{ce}^2}}$$\nWe define the effective ion plasma frequency squared, $\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2$, as the sum over all ion species:\n$$\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2 \\equiv \\sum_{i} \\omega_{pi}^2 = \\omega_{p\\mathrm{D}}^2 + \\omega_{p\\mathrm{T}}^2 + \\omega_{p\\mathrm{He}}^2$$\nThus, the lower hybrid frequency squared is:\n$$\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2 = \\frac{\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2}{1 + \\omega_{pe}^2 / \\omega_{ce}^2}$$\n\n### Step 3: Effective Ion Plasma Frequency\nWe now express $\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2$ as a function of $x$. Using the definition $\\omega_{ps}^2 = n_s Z_s^2 e^2 / (\\varepsilon_0 m_s)$, we have:\n$$\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(x) = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{D}} Z_{\\mathrm{D}}^2 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_{\\mathrm{D}}} + \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{T}} Z_{\\mathrm{T}}^2 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_{\\mathrm{T}}} + \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{He}} Z_{\\mathrm{He}}^2 e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_{\\mathrm{He}}}$$\nSubstituting the densities, charges, and masses ($m_{\\mathrm{D}}=2m_p$, $m_{\\mathrm{T}}=3m_p$, $m_{\\mathrm{He}}=4m_p$):\n$$\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(x) = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon_0} \\left[ \\frac{(n_e \\frac{1-2x}{2})(1^2)}{2m_p} + \\frac{(n_e \\frac{1-2x}{2})(1^2)}{3m_p} + \\frac{(x n_e)(2^2)}{4m_p} \\right]$$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$$\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(x) = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left[ \\frac{1-2x}{4} + \\frac{1-2x}{6} + \\frac{4x}{4} \\right]$$\n$$\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(x) = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left[ (1-2x) \\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{6}\\right) + x \\right]$$\n$$\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(x) = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left[ (1-2x) \\left(\\frac{3+2}{12}\\right) + x \\right] = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left[ (1-2x)\\frac{5}{12} + x \\right]$$\n$$\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(x) = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left[ \\frac{5 - 10x + 12x}{12} \\right] = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left( \\frac{5 + 2x}{12} \\right)$$\nThis is the expression for the effective ion plasma frequency squared as a function of $x$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculation of Ratios\nWe need to compute two ratios, $R_{\\pi}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{LH}}$, for $x=0.07$ relative to the case with no helium ash ($x=0$).\n\nFirst, we evaluate $\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(0)$ by setting $x=0$ in the derived expression:\n$$\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(0) = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left( \\frac{5 + 2(0)}{12} \\right) = \\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left( \\frac{5}{12} \\right)$$\n\nThe ratio of the squared effective ion plasma frequencies is:\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(x)}{\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(0)} = \\frac{\\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left( \\frac{5 + 2x}{12} \\right)}{\\frac{n_e e^2}{\\varepsilon_0 m_p} \\left( \\frac{5}{12} \\right)} = \\frac{5 + 2x}{5} = 1 + \\frac{2x}{5}$$\nThe ratio $R_{\\pi}$ is the square root of this quantity:\n$$R_{\\pi}(x) = \\frac{\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}(x)}{\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}(0)} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2x}{5}}$$\nNow, we compute the ratio $R_{\\mathrm{LH}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{LH}}(x) = \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}(x)}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}(0)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2(x)}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2(0)}}$$\nUsing the formula for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2$:\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2(x)}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2(0)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(x)}{1 + \\omega_{pe}^2 / \\omega_{ce}^2}}{\\frac{\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(0)}{1 + \\omega_{pe}^2 / \\omega_{ce}^2}}$$\nThe denominator $1 + \\omega_{pe}^2 / \\omega_{ce}^2$ is constant because $n_e$ and $B$ are fixed. Therefore, it cancels out:\n$$\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2(x)}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LH}}^2(0)} = \\frac{\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(x)}{\\omega_{pi, \\mathrm{eff}}^2(0)} = 1 + \\frac{2x}{5}$$\nThis implies that $R_{\\mathrm{LH}}(x) = R_{\\pi}(x)$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given value $x = 0.07$:\n$$R_{\\pi} = R_{\\mathrm{LH}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2(0.07)}{5}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{0.14}{5}} = \\sqrt{1 + 0.028} = \\sqrt{1.028}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{1.028} \\approx 1.013903348...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.014$. Both ratios are equal to this value.\nThe final answer requires a row matrix for the two dimensionless ratios $R_{\\pi}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{LH}}$.\n$$R_{\\pi} = 1.014$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{LH}} = 1.014$$",
