            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the threshold zonal shearing rate, denoted by $\\gamma_E$, that reduces the effective linear Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) growth rate by a factor of two. We begin by analyzing the given model for the evolution of the fluctuation amplitude, $A(t)$.\n\nThe evolution of the fluctuation amplitude is described by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\left(\\gamma_L - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}}\\right) A\n$$\nFrom this equation, the effective growth rate, which we shall denote as $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the term in the parenthesis that governs the exponential growth or decay of the amplitude. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\gamma_L - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}}\n$$\nHere, $\\gamma_L$ is the constant, unsheared linear ITG growth rate, and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ is the shearing decorrelation rate. All rates, including $\\gamma_L$, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, and $\\gamma_E$, have units of inverse seconds, $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem specifies the condition that the effective growth rate is reduced by a factor of two. This reduction is relative to the growth rate in the absence of the suppression mechanism, which is the shearing flow. In the absence of shearing, the shear rate $\\gamma_E = 0$. This implies that the radial wavenumber advection is zero, $\\mathrm{d}k_x/\\mathrm{d}t = 0$, leading to a decorrelation rate of $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 0$. In this baseline case, the effective growth rate is simply $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\gamma_L$.\n\nThe condition for the threshold shearing rate is therefore that the new effective growth rate is one-half of this baseline rate:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_L\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ into this condition, we obtain:\n$$\n\\gamma_L - \\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_L\n$$\nSolving for the required decorrelation rate $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ yields:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}} = \\gamma_L - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_L\n$$\nNext, we must relate the decorrelation rate $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ to the zonal shearing rate $\\gamma_E$. The problem provides the definition of the shearing decorrelation rate as:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\doteq \\frac{|\\frac{\\mathrm{d}k_x}{\\mathrm{d}t}|}{\\Delta k_x}\n$$\nWe are also given the k-space advection law for the radial wavenumber $k_x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}k_x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k_y \\gamma_E\n$$\nwhere $k_y$ is the poloidal wavenumber and $\\gamma_E$ is the constant radial shear rate of the E×B flow.\n\nFurthermore, the model specifies the intrinsic spectral width $\\Delta k_x$ for the ITG wave packet to be of the order of the poloidal wavenumber, $|k_y|$. We are to take this as an equality based on the problem's phrasing:\n$$\n\\Delta k_x = |k_y|\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mathrm{d}k_x/\\mathrm{d}t$ and $\\Delta k_x$ into the definition of $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, we find:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}} = \\frac{|k_y \\gamma_E|}{|k_y|} = \\frac{|k_y| |\\gamma_E|}{|k_y|}\n$$\nFor a drift-wave, the poloidal wavenumber $k_y$ must be non-zero, so we can simplify the expression by canceling $|k_y|$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}} = |\\gamma_E|\n$$\nSince $\\gamma_E$ represents a rate of shearing, it is physically considered a non-negative quantity. Thus, we can write $|\\gamma_E| = \\gamma_E$. The decorrelation rate is therefore equal to the zonal shearing rate:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}} = \\gamma_E\n$$\nThis result demonstrates a key feature of this shearing model: the decorrelation rate is independent of the specific wavenumbers of the turbulent eddy, depending only on the background flow shear.\n\nFinally, to find the threshold shearing rate $\\gamma_E$, we equate our two expressions for $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}}$. We found that the required decorrelation rate is $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_L$, and that this rate is equal to the flow shear rate, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{sh}} = \\gamma_E$. Therefore, the threshold shearing rate is:\n$$\n\\gamma_E = \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma_L\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the threshold zonal shearing rate $\\gamma_E$ required to reduce the effective linear ITG growth rate by a factor of two, expressed in terms of the unsheared growth rate $\\gamma_L$.",

The synthetic diagnostic emulates the time history of the flux-surface average of the electrostatic potential, constructed to reflect fundamental gyrokinetic behavior without requiring an actual gyrokinetic solver.\n\nBegin from the following foundational principles:\n- The collisionless, linear, axisymmetric gyrokinetic response for a zonal perturbation separates into an oscillatory component at the geodesic acoustic mode frequency and a non-oscillatory component associated with the residual zonal flow. Mathematically, the diagnostic signal may be idealized as the sum of a constant offset representing the residual, a damped oscillation at the geodesic acoustic mode frequency, and small auxiliary terms (e.g., numerical drift and noise).\n- A frequency-domain filter can remove the GAM band from the signal without distorting the constant residual offset, provided that the filter is applied in a non-causal, zero-phase manner.\n\nThe synthetic signal to be analyzed is defined, for time $t \\in [0, T)$, as\n$$\n\\phi(t) = \\phi_0 \\left[ R + (1 - R) \\exp(-\\alpha t) \\cos(\\omega_G t) \\right] + \\phi_0 \\, d \\, \\frac{t}{T} + \\phi_0 \\, r_{\\mathrm{noise}} \\left[ \\tfrac{1}{2} \\sin(2\\pi f_{n1} t) + \\tfrac{1}{2} \\sin(2\\pi f_{n2} t) \\right],\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the true residual fraction to be measured, $\\phi_0$ is the initial electrostatic potential amplitude, $\\alpha$ is a damping rate, $\\omega_G$ is the geodesic acoustic mode angular frequency, $d$ is a dimensionless linear drift fraction over the interval $[0, T)$, $r_{\\mathrm{noise}}$ is a dimensionless noise amplitude fraction, and $f_{n1}$ and $f_{n2}$ are deterministic noise frequencies chosen as fixed fractions of the sampling rate.
