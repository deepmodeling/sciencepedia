            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. It presents a standard derivation in tokamak plasma physics. We will proceed with the solution in three parts as requested: derivation of the bounce period, numerical evaluation of the bounce period, and estimation of the collision frequency for comparison.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Trapped-Electron Bounce Frequency and Period**\n\nWe begin with the principles of conservation of total energy $E$ and magnetic moment $\\mu$ for an electron moving in a static magnetic field. The total energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2$, which is constant. The velocity squared can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field line: $v^2 = v_{\\parallel}^2 + v_{\\perp}^2$. The magnetic moment is given by $\\mu = \\frac{m v_{\\perp}^2}{2B}$, which is an adiabatic invariant.\n\nFrom the conservation of $\\mu$, we can express the perpendicular velocity as $v_{\\perp}^2 = \\frac{2\\mu B}{m}$. Substituting this into the expression for the total velocity, we find the parallel velocity:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^2 = v^2 - v_{\\perp}^2 = v^2 - \\frac{2\\mu B}{m}$$\nThe magnetic field strength on a given flux surface is modeled as a function of the poloidal angle $\\theta$, where $\\theta=0$ corresponds to the low-field outboard midplane:\n$$\nB(\\theta) = B_{0}\\left(1 - \\epsilon \\cos\\theta\\right)\n$$\nIn this model, the magnetic field is minimum at $\\theta=0$, and particles can be trapped in the weak-field region around this point. A trapped particle has turning points, or bounce points, at poloidal angles $\\pm \\theta_b$ where its parallel velocity $v_{\\parallel}$ vanishes. At these points, all its kinetic energy is in the perpendicular direction, so $v = v_{\\perp}$. The magnetic field at the bounce point is $B_b = B(\\theta_b)$. The conservation of energy and magnetic moment between any point $\\theta$ and the bounce point $\\theta_b$ implies:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\mu B_b$$\nThus, we can write $\\frac{2\\mu}{m} = \\frac{v^2}{B_b}$. The parallel velocity at any point $\\theta$ is then:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^2 = v^2 - v^2 \\frac{B(\\theta)}{B_b} = v^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{B_0(1 - \\epsilon \\cos\\theta)}{B_0(1 - \\epsilon \\cos\\theta_b)}\\right) = v^2 \\frac{\\epsilon(\\cos\\theta - \\cos\\theta_b)}{1 - \\epsilon \\cos\\theta_b}$$\nFor deeply trapped electrons, the bounce angle $\\theta_b$ is small. We consider small-amplitude oscillations, so $\\theta$ is also small. We can use the Taylor expansion for the cosine function, $\\cos x \\approx 1 - x^2/2$ for small $x$. The expression for $v_{\\parallel}^2$ becomes:\n$$v_{\\parallel}^2 \\approx v^2 \\frac{\\epsilon\\left((1 - \\theta^2/2) - (1 - \\theta_b^2/2)\\right)}{1 - \\epsilon(1 - \\theta_b^2/2)} = v^2 \\frac{\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}(\\theta_b^2 - \\theta^2)}{1 - \\epsilon + \\epsilon\\theta_b^2/2}$$\nSince $\\epsilon \\ll 1$ and $\\theta_b$ is small, the denominator can be approximated as $1$.\n$$v_{\\parallel}^2 \\approx \\frac{v^2\\epsilon}{2}(\\theta_b^2 - \\theta^2)$$\nThe parallel velocity is related to the rate of change of the angle $\\theta$ by $v_{\\parallel} = \\frac{dl}{dt}$, where $l$ is the distance along the magnetic field line. For a large-aspect-ratio tokamak, this distance is related to the poloidal angle by $\\frac{dl}{d\\theta} \\approx qR$. Therefore, $v_{\\parallel} \\approx qR \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$.\n\nSubstituting this into our equation for $v_{\\parallel}^2$:\n$$\\left(qR \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right)^2 = \\frac{v^2\\epsilon}{2}(\\theta_b^2 - \\theta^2)$$\nDifferentiating this equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$2(qR)^2 \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right) \\left(\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}\\right) = \\frac{v^2\\epsilon}{2}\\left(-2\\theta \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right)$$\nAssuming $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} \\neq 0$ (except at the bounce points), we can simplify this to:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\left(\\frac{v^2\\epsilon}{2(qR)^2}\\right)\\theta = 0$$\nThis is the standard equation for simple harmonic motion, $\\ddot{x} + \\omega^2 x = 0$. By comparison, we identify the squared bounce frequency:\n$$\\omega_b^2 = \\frac{v^2\\epsilon}{2(qR)^2}$$\nThe bounce frequency for deeply trapped electrons is therefore:\n$$\\omega_b = \\frac{v\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}{\\sqrt{2} qR}$$\nThe bounce period, $\\tau_b$, is the time for one full oscillation, which is related to the angular frequency by $\\tau_b = 2\\pi/\\omega_b$.\n$$\\tau_b = \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2} qR}{v\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}$$\nThis expression gives the bounce period in terms of the requested variables $v$, $R$, $q$, and $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of $\\tau_b$**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n$R = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$q = 2.0$\n$\\epsilon = 0.20$\n$v = 1.33 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\tau_b$:\n$$\\tau_b = \\frac{2\\pi \\sqrt{2} (2.0)(3.0)}{(1.33 \\times 10^{7})\\sqrt{0.20}} = \\frac{12\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{(1.33 \\times 10^{7})\\sqrt{0.20}}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the numerical factors:\n$\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142$\n$\\sqrt{0.20} \\approx 0.4472$\n$\\pi \\approx 3.1416$\nSo, the numerator is $12 \\times \\pi \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 12 \\times 3.1416 \\times 1.4142 \\approx 53.296$.\nThe denominator is $(1.33 \\times 10^7) \\times 0.4472 \\approx 5.9478 \\times 10^6$.\n$$\\tau_b \\approx \\frac{53.296}{5.9478 \\times 10^6} \\approx 8.9606 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\\tau_b \\approx 8.96 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\n**Part 3: Collision Frequency Estimation and Ordering**\n\nWe are asked to estimate the electron-ion collision frequency $\\nu_{ei}$ using the provided Spitzer formula:\n$$\\nu_{ei} \\approx 2.9 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\frac{n_{e}[\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}]\\,\\ln\\Lambda}{\\left(T_{e}[\\mathrm{eV}]\\right)^{3/2}}$$\nThe given plasma parameters are:\n$n_{e} = 1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$\n$T_{e} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n$\\ln\\Lambda = 17$\n\nFirst, we must convert the units of $n_e$ and $T_e$ to match the formula.\n$n_{e} = 1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\,\\mathrm{m^{-3}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{20} \\times (10^{-2})^3\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n$T_{e} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 5.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formula:\n$$\\nu_{ei} \\approx (2.9 \\times 10^{-6}) \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{14})(17)}{(5.0 \\times 10^3)^{3/2}} = (2.9 \\times 10^{-6}) \\frac{1.7 \\times 10^{15}}{(5000)^{1.5}}$$\nThe denominator is $(5000)^{1.5} \\approx 3.536 \\times 10^5$.\n$$\\nu_{ei} \\approx \\frac{2.9 \\times 1.7 \\times 10^9}{3.536 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{4.93 \\times 10^9}{3.536 \\times 10^5} \\approx 1.39 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nThe characteristic time between collisions is the inverse of this frequency:\n$$\\nu_{ei}^{-1} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.39 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 7.19 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nNow we compare the bounce period $\\tau_b$ with the collision time $\\nu_{ei}^{-1}$:\n$\\tau_b \\approx 8.96 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\nu_{ei}^{-1} \\approx 7.19 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 71.9 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\nClearly, $\\tau_b  \\nu_{ei}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It represents a standard, albeit simplified, problem in the study of microinstabilities in magnetically confined plasmas. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a qualitative and quantitative derivation of the scaling of the Trapped Electron Mode (TEM) growth rate with the perpendicular wavenumber $k_{\\perp}$, and then to find the wavenumber $k_{\\perp}^{\\ast}$ that maximizes this growth rate.\n\nFirst, we analyze the scaling of the instability drive and the stabilizing effect.\n\nThe instability drive for the curvature-driven TEM arises from the resonant interaction of trapped electrons with the wave. This resonance occurs when the wave frequency is comparable to the electron's magnetic drift frequency, which is composed of curvature and grad-B drifts. The problem states that the electron curvature drift frequency scales as $\\omega_{De} \\sim k_{y} v_{De}$. The drift velocity $v_{De}$ itself is given to scale as $v_{De} \\sim \\frac{2 T_{e}}{e B R}$. For the ballooning-type perturbations considered, localized on the outboard midplane, the perpendicular wavenumber $k_{\\perp}$ is dominated by its binormal component, $k_{y}$, so we use the approximation $k_{\\perp} \\approx k_{y}$ for scaling purposes. The growth rate of the instability, $\\gamma$, is driven by this drift and is proportional to it. Therefore, the drive term for the growth rate scales linearly with the perpendicular wavenumber:\n$$\n\\text{Drive} \\propto \\omega_{De} \\sim k_{y} \\propto k_{\\perp}\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the suppression mechanism. The instability involves charge separation, which is described by the quasi-neutrality condition. The ion response to the electrostatic potential perturbation includes a polarization drift component, which acts to shield the potential and thus suppress the instability. This effect is known as Finite Larmor Radius (FLR) suppression. The problem states that the ion polarization density response enters the quasi-neutrality condition through the operator $1 - \\Gamma_{0}(b_{i})$, where $b_{i} \\equiv k_{\\perp}^{2} \\rho_{i}^{2}$ and $\\rho_{i}$ is the ion Larmor radius. In the long-wavelength limit ($k_{\\perp} \\rho_{i} \\ll 1$), we have $b_{i} \\ll 1$, and the provided expansion is $1 - \\Gamma_{0}(b_{i}) \\approx b_{i} = k_{\\perp}^{2} \\rho_{i}^{2}$.\n\nIn a simplified dispersion relation for drift waves, the denominator representing the plasma's dielectric response often takes the form $1 + \\frac{T_{e}}{T_{i}}(1-\\Gamma_{0}(b_{i}))$, where $T_{e}$ and $T_{i}$ are the electron and ion temperatures, respectively. This term accounts for the adiabatic electron response (the '$1$') and the ion response. The term $\\frac{T_e}{T_i}$ appears because ions respond to the potential normalized to their own temperature $T_i$, while the overall system dynamics are often analyzed in units of $T_e$. Using the long-wavelength expansion, this suppression term becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Suppression Factor} \\approx 1 + \\frac{T_{e}}{T_{i}} b_{i} = 1 + \\frac{T_{e}}{T_{i}} k_{\\perp}^{2} \\rho_{i}^{2}\n$$\nWe are asked to show this is equivalent to $1 + k_{\\perp}^{2} \\rho_{s}^{2}$. Let's verify this using the provided definitions. The ion gyroradius is $\\rho_{i} = \\frac{v_{ti}}{\\Omega_{i}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{T_{i}/m_{i}}}{\\Omega_{i}}$. The sound gyroradius is $\\rho_{s} = \\frac{c_{s}}{\\Omega_{i}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{T_{e}/m_{i}}}{\\Omega_{i}}$.\nTherefore, we can write $\\rho_{s}^{2}$ as:\n$$\n\\rho_{s}^{2} = \\frac{T_{e}/m_{i}}{\\Omega_{i}^{2}} = \\frac{T_{e}}{T_{i}} \\frac{T_{i}/m_{i}}{\\Omega_{i}^{2}} = \\frac{T_{e}}{T_{i}} \\rho_{i}^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the suppression factor expression gives:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{T_{e}}{T_{i}} k_{\\perp}^{2} \\rho_{i}^{2} = 1 + k_{\\perp}^{2} \\left( \\frac{T_{e}}{T_{i}} \\rho_{i}^{2} \\right) = 1 + k_{\\perp}^{2} \\rho_{s}^{2}\n$$\nThis confirms that the FLR suppression effect, in the long-wavelength limit, contributes a factor of $1 + k_{\\perp}^{2} \\rho_{s}^{2}$ to the denominator of the response function.\n\nNow, we construct the growth-rate proxy, $\\gamma(k_{\\perp})$. The problem specifies that this proxy should be proportional to the curvature drive and inversely proportional to the FLR polarization suppression. Keeping only the leading-order dependence on $k_{\\perp}$ and absorbing all other constants into a single positive constant $C$, we have:\n$$\n\\gamma(k_{\\perp}) = C \\frac{k_{\\perp}}{1 + k_{\\perp}^{2} \\rho_{s}^{2}}\n$$\nWe must find the perpendicular wavenumber $k_{\\perp}^{\\ast}$ at which this growth rate is maximum.

The numerator, $1 - k_{\\perp}^{2} \\rho_{s}^{2}$, is positive for $k_{\\perp}  1/\\rho_{s}$ and negative for $k_{\\perp}  1/\\rho_{s}$. This indicates that $\\gamma(k_{\\perp})$ increases up to $k_{\\perp} = 1/\\rho_{s}$ and decreases thereafter, confirming that $k_{\\perp}^{\\ast} = 1/\\rho_{s}$ corresponds to a maximum.\n\nThe sound gyroradius $\\rho_s$ has units of length (meters in SI units). Therefore, the resulting wavenumber $k_{\\perp}^{\\ast} = 1/\\rho_s$ has the correct units of inverse length (inverse meters). The condition $k_{\\perp}^{\\ast} \\rho_i \\sim 1$ (the limit of the long-wavelength approximation) translates to $(1/\\rho_s)\\rho_i \\sim 1$, or $\\rho_i/\\rho_s \\sim 1$. Since $\\rho_i/\\rho_s = \\sqrt{T_i/T_e}$, this implies the model is most self-consistent in its assumptions for plasmas where $T_i \\sim T_e$, which is a common scenario.",

The first is $I_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 0$. Substituting this into equation (2) gives $\\nu_{Z}\\, Z_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 0$, which implies $Z_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 0$ since $\\nu_{Z}$ is positive. This corresponds to the trivial steady state $(0, 0)$, where there is no turbulence and no zonal flow.\n\nThe problem, however, explicitly asks for a *nontrivial, positive* steady state, so we must consider the second possibility, where $I_{\\mathrm{sat}}  0$. In this case, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$\n\\gamma_{L} \\;-\\; \\alpha\\, Z_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\;-\\; \\mu\\, I_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\;=\\; 0 \\quad \\quad (3)\n$$\nFrom equation (2), we can express $Z_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ in terms of $I_{\\mathrm{sat}}$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\beta}{\\nu_{Z}} I_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\quad \\quad (4)\n$$\nSince $\\beta  0$ and $\\nu_Z  0$, a positive $I_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ implies a positive $Z_{\\mathrm{sat}}$, consistent with the problem's requirement.\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $Z_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ from equation (4) into equation (3):\n$$\n\\gamma_{L} \\;-\\; \\alpha \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{\\nu_{Z}} I_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\right) \\;-\\; \\mu\\, I_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nWe can solve this linear equation for $I_{\\mathrm{sat}}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{L} \\;=\\; I_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\beta}{\\nu_{Z}} + \\mu \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{L} \\;=\\; I_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\beta + \\mu \\nu_{Z}}{\\nu_{Z}} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $I_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ yields the symbolic expression for the steady-state turbulence intensity:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\gamma_{L} \\nu_{Z}}{\\alpha \\beta + \\mu \\nu_{Z}}\n$$\nTo find the corresponding steady-state zonal flow energy, we substitute this expression for $I_{\\mathrm{sat}}$ back into equation (4):\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\beta}{\\nu_{Z}} \\left( \\frac{\\gamma_{L} \\nu_{Z}}{\\alpha \\beta + \\mu \\nu_{Z}} \\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\beta \\gamma_{L}}{\\alpha \\beta + \\mu \\nu_{Z}}\n$$\nWe are given the following parameter values in normalized units:\n$$\n\\gamma_{L} = \\frac{2}{5}, \\quad \\mu = \\frac{2}{5}, \\quad \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\beta = \\frac{1}{5}, \\quad \\nu_{Z} = \\frac{1}{10}\n$$\nFirst, let's compute the value of the denominator term $\\alpha \\beta + \\mu \\nu_{Z}$:\n$$\n\\alpha \\beta + \\mu \\nu_{Z} \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{2}{50} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{25}\n$$\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $50$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{25} \\;=\\; \\frac{5}{50} + \\frac{2}{50} \\;=\\; \\frac{7}{50}\n$$\nNow, we can evaluate $I_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. The numerator is $\\gamma_{L} \\nu_{Z}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{L} \\nu_{Z} \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{50} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{25}\n$$\nTherefore, the steady-state turbulence intensity is:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\gamma_{L} \\nu_{Z}}{\\alpha \\beta + \\mu \\nu_{Z}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1/25}{7/50} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{25} \\times \\frac{50}{7} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{7}\n$$\nNext, we evaluate $Z_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. We can use the relation $Z_{\\mathrm{sat}} = (\\beta / \\nu_{Z}) I_{\\mathrm{sat}}$. First, we compute the ratio $\\beta / \\nu_{Z}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\nu_{Z}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1/5}{1/10} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{5} \\times 10 \\;=\\; 2\n$$\nNow, we find $Z_{\\mathrm{sat}}$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\;=\\; 2 \\times I_{\\mathrm{sat}} \\;=\\; 2 \\times \\frac{2}{7} \\;=\\; \\frac{4}{7}\n$$\nThus, the nontrivial, positive steady state is $(I_{\\mathrm{sat}}, Z_{\\mathrm{sat}}) = (2/7, 4/7)$. Both values are positive, as required.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair of steady-state amplitudes, $(I_{\\mathrm{sat}}, Z_{\\mathrm{sat}})$, expressed as exact rational numbers.",
