            "problem": "In computational fusion science and engineering, numerical solvers of Maxwell’s equations must respect the dimensional consistency imposed by the International System of Units (SI).

It is free of contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts: dimensional analysis of Maxwell's equations, derivation of the electromagnetic wave equation, and the numerical calculation of the wave speed in vacuum.\n\n**Part 1: Dimensional Analysis of Maxwell's Equations**\n\nTo perform the dimensional analysis, we first establish the dimensions of all physical quantities in terms of the SI base units: mass ($M$, kilogram, $\\mathrm{kg}$), length ($L$, meter, $\\mathrm{m}$), time ($T$, second, $\\mathrm{s}$), and electric current ($I$, ampere, $\\mathrm{A}$). The provided derived-unit relations are instrumental.\n\nThe dimension of electric potential (volt, $\\mathrm{V}$) is given as $[V] = M L^2 T^{-3} I^{-1}$.\nFrom this, we can find the dimension of the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$. Since an electric field is the negative gradient of the scalar potential, $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V$, its dimension is that of potential per unit length:\n$[\\mathbf{E}] = \\frac{[V]}{L} = \\frac{M L^2 T^{-3} I^{-1}}{L} = M L T^{-3} I^{-1}$.\n\nThe dimension of the magnetic field ($\\mathbf{B}$, in tesla, $\\mathrm{T}$) is given as $[T] = [V] T L^{-2}$.\n$[\\mathbf{B}] = \\frac{[V] T}{L^2} = \\frac{(M L^2 T^{-3} I^{-1}) T}{L^2} = M T^{-2} I^{-1}$.\n\nThe dimension of free charge density ($\\rho$) is charge per unit volume. Charge is current times time ($[Q] = I T$).\n$[\\rho] = \\frac{Q}{L^3} = I T L^{-3}$.\n\nThe dimension of free current density ($\\mathbf{J}$) is current per unit area.\n$[\\mathbf{J}] = \\frac{I}{L^2} = I L^{-2}$.\n\nThe del operator ($\\nabla$) has dimensions of inverse length, $L^{-1}$. The partial time derivative ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$) has dimensions of inverse time, $T^{-1}$.\n\nNow, we analyze each of Maxwell's equations.\n\n**1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_{0}}$**\nThe left-hand side (LHS) has dimensions:\n$[\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}] = [\\nabla][\\mathbf{E}] = (L^{-1}) (M L T^{-3} I^{-1}) = M T^{-3} I^{-1}$.\nThe right-hand side (RHS) has dimensions:\n$[\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_{0}}] = \\frac{[\\rho]}{[\\epsilon_{0}]} = \\frac{I T L^{-3}}{[\\epsilon_{0}]}$.\nFor the equation to be dimensionally consistent, the dimensions of the LHS and RHS must be equal.\n$M T^{-3} I^{-1} = \\frac{I T L^{-3}}{[\\epsilon_{0}]}$.\nSolving for the dimensions of vacuum permittivity, $[\\epsilon_{0}]$:\n$[\\epsilon_{0}] = \\frac{I T L^{-3}}{M T^{-3} I^{-1}} = M^{-1} L^{-3} T^{4} I^{2}$.\nIn SI base units, the expression for $\\epsilon_{0}$ is $\\mathrm{kg^{-1}\\,m^{-3}\\,s^{4}\\,A^{2}}$.\n\n**2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$**\nThe LHS has dimensions:\n$[\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B}] = [\\nabla][\\mathbf{B}] = (L^{-1}) (M T^{-2} I^{-1}) = M L^{-1} T^{-2} I^{-1}$.\nThe equation states that this physical quantity is zero. The dimensional consistency is trivial; a quantity with well-defined dimensions is asserted to be zero.\n\n**3. Faraday's Law of Induction: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$**\nThe LHS has dimensions:\n$[\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}] = [\\nabla][\\mathbf{E}] = (L^{-1}) (M L T^{-3} I^{-1}) = M T^{-3} I^{-1}$.\nThe RHS has dimensions:\n$[-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}] = \\frac{[\\mathbf{B}]}{T} = \\frac{M T^{-2} I^{-1}}{T} = M T^{-3} I^{-1}$.\nThe dimensions of the LHS and RHS are identical, so the equation is dimensionally consistent.\n\n**4. Ampere-Maxwell Law: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J} + \\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$**\nThe LHS has dimensions:\n$[\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}] = [\\nabla][\\mathbf{B}] = (L^{-1}) (M T^{-2} I^{-1}) = M L^{-1} T^{-2} I^{-1}$.\nFor consistency, all terms on the RHS must have these same dimensions. Let's analyze the first term on the RHS, $\\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J}$.\n$[\\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J}] = [\\mu_{0}] [\\mathbf{J}] = [\\mu_{0}] (I L^{-2})$.\nEquating this to the dimensions of the LHS:\n$[\\mu_{0}] (I L^{-2}) = M L^{-1} T^{-2} I^{-1}$.\nSolving for the dimensions of vacuum permeability, $[\\mu_{0}]$:\n$[\\mu_{0}] = \\frac{M L^{-1} T^{-2} I^{-1}}{I L^{-2}} = M L T^{-2} I^{-2}$.\nIn SI base units, the expression for $\\mu_{0}$ is $\\mathrm{kg\\,m\\,s^{-2}\\,A^{-2}}$.\n\nNow we check the consistency of the second term on the RHS, $\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$.\n$[\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}] = [\\mu_{0}] [\\epsilon_{0}] \\frac{[\\mathbf{E}]}{T} = (M L T^{-2} I^{-2}) (M^{-1} L^{-3} T^{4} I^{2}) \\frac{(M L T^{-3} I^{-1})}{T}$.\n$[\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}] = (L^{-2} T^{2}) (M L T^{-4} I^{-1}) = M L^{-1} T^{-2} I^{-1}$.\nThis matches the dimensions of the LHS, confirming the dimensional consistency of the Ampere-Maxwell law.\n\nFinally, we confirm the dimensions of the product $\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0}$.\n$[\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0}] = [\\mu_{0}][\\epsilon_{0}] = (M L T^{-2} I^{-2}) (M^{-1} L^{-3} T^{4} I^{2}) = M^{0} L^{-2} T^{2} I^{0} = L^{-2} T^{2}$.\nThe dimensions are inverse length squared times time squared, which matches the required $\\mathrm{s^{2}\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Wave Equation**\n\nIn a vacuum with no sources, $\\rho = 0$ and $\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{0}$. Maxwell's equations simplify to:\n1. $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$\n2. $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$\n3. $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$\n4. $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$\n\nTo derive the wave equation for the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, we take the curl of Faraday's Law (Equation 3):\n$\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = \\nabla \\times (-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t})$.\nAssuming the fields are sufficiently smooth, we can interchange the spatial and temporal derivatives on the RHS:\n$\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})$.\nWe now apply the vector calculus identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$ to the LHS:\n$\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) - \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B})$.\nSubstitute Equation 1 ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$) into the LHS and Equation 4 ($\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$) into the RHS:\n$\\nabla(0) - \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t})$.\n$-\\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{E} = -\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t^{2}}$.\nMultiplying by $-1$, we obtain the homogeneous vector wave equation for $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$ \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{E} = \\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t^{2}} $$\nThe general form of a wave equation is $\\nabla^{2}\\psi = \\frac{1}{v^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\psi}{\\partial t^{2}}$, where $v$ is the phase speed of the wave. By comparing our derived equation for $\\mathbf{E}$ with the general form, we can identify a correspondence for the speed:\n$\\frac{1}{v^{2}} = \\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0}$.\nThus, the wave speed is $v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0}}}$. This speed is denoted by $c$, the speed of light in vacuum.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation of the Wave Speed**\n\nThe problem provides the standard values for the vacuum permeability and permittivity:\n$\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H\\,m^{-1}}$\n$\\epsilon_{0} = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$\n\nThe speed of light in vacuum, $c$, is calculated using the formula derived in Part 2:\n$c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0}}}$.\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12})}} \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\nFirst, calculate the product in the denominator:\n$\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} = (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7})(8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}) \\, \\mathrm{s^{2}\\,m^{-2}}$\n$\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\approx (1.2566370614 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}) \\, \\mathrm{s^{2}\\,m^{-2}}$\n$\\mu_{0}\\epsilon_{0} \\approx 1.112650056 \\times 10^{-17} \\, \\mathrm{s^{2}\\,m^{-2}}$.\nThis product is exactly equal to $1/c_{exact}^2$, where $c_{exact} = 299792458 \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ by definition of the meter.\nLet's compute the value from the given constants:\n$c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1.112650056 \\times 10^{-17}}} \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n$c \\approx \\frac{1}{3.33564095 \\times 10^{-9}} \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n$c \\approx 299792458 \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nThe problem requires rounding this value to four significant figures.\n$c = 2.99792458 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\nThe first four significant figures are $2$, $9$, $9$, and $7$.

It is a standard derivation in electromagnetism and is directly relevant to wave propagation in fusion plasmas. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### 1. Maxwell's Equations in the Phasor Domain\n\nThe analysis begins with the macroscopic Maxwell's equations in the time domain for a material medium. Let the time-domain vector fields be denoted by calligraphic letters (e.g., $\\mathcal{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t)$). The equations are:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathcal{D} = \\rho_f \\\\\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathcal{B} = 0 \\\\\n\\nabla \\times \\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{B}}{\\partial t} \\\\\n\\nabla \\times \\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{J}_f + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{D}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a source-free region, which implies the free charge density $\\rho_f = 0$ and the absence of any externally impressed current sources. The current density $\\mathcal{J}_f$ present is solely the conduction current induced by the electric field.\n\nThe medium is described by linear, time-invariant, isotropic, and homogeneous constitutive relations:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\epsilon \\mathcal{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\\n\\mathcal{B}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\mu \\mathcal{H}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\\\\n\\mathcal{J}_f(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\sigma \\mathcal{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\quad \\text{(Ohm's Law)}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ (permittivity), $\\mu$ (permeability), and $\\sigma$ (conductivity) are scalar constants.\n\nFor time-harmonic fields with an angular frequency $\\omega$, we use the phasor representation. A time-domain field $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ is related to its complex phasor $\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})$ by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\text{Re}[\\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{r})e^{-i\\omega t}]\n$$\nThe time derivative of $\\mathcal{A}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{A}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\text{Re}[\\mathbf{A}e^{-i\\omega t}] = \\text{Re}\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\mathbf{A}e^{-i\\omega t})\\right] = \\text{Re}[-i\\omega \\mathbf{A}e^{-i\\omega t}]\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for any linear operation, the time derivative operator $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by $-i\\omega$ in the phasor domain. Applying this transformation to the two curl equations of Maxwell:\n\nFaraday's Law: $\\nabla \\times \\mathcal{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{B}}{\\partial t}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -(-i\\omega\\mathbf{B}) \\implies \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = i\\omega\\mathbf{B}\n$$\n\nAmpère-Maxwell Law: $\\nabla \\times \\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{J}_f + \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{D}}{\\partial t}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J}_f + (-i\\omega\\mathbf{D}) \\implies \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J}_f - i\\omega\\mathbf{D}\n$$\nThe problem requires the curl equations in terms of the complex field amplitudes $\\mathbf{E}$, $\\mathbf{B}$, $\\mathbf{D}$, $\\mathbf{H}$, and $\\mathbf{J}_f$. Using the constitutive relations in the phasor domain ($\\mathbf{D}=\\epsilon\\mathbf{E}$, $\\mathbf{B}=\\mu\\mathbf{H}$, $\\mathbf{J}_f=\\sigma\\mathbf{E}$), we can also write these equations as:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = i\\omega\\mu\\mathbf{H} \\\\\n\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = (\\sigma - i\\omega\\epsilon)\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThese are the required phasor-domain curl equations.\n\n### 2. Justification of the Phasor Method\n\nThe validity of the phasor method for analyzing linear time-invariant (LTI) systems rests on several key principles:\n\n-   **Linearity**: Maxwell's equations and the given constitutive relations are linear. This means that for any linear operator $L$ representing a physical process (like differentiation or the system's response), and any two fields $\\mathbf{A}_1$ and $\\mathbf{A}_2$, $L(c_1\\mathbf{A}_1 + c_2\\mathbf{A}_2) = c_1L(\\mathbf{A}_1) + c_2L(\\mathbf{A}_2)$ for scalar constants $c_1, c_2$. An essential property of a real linear operator $L$ is that it commutes with the real-part operator: $L(\\text{Re}[\\mathbf{Z}]) = \\text{Re}[L(\\mathbf{Z})]$ for a complex quantity $\\mathbf{Z}$. This allows us to work entirely with complex phasors and take the real part only at the end to recover the physical field.\n\n-   **Time-Invariance**: The properties of the medium ($\\epsilon, \\mu, \\sigma$) are assumed to be constant in time. This ensures that the system's response to an input signal depends only on the input itself, not on the time at which it is applied. This time-invariance is critical for the time-derivative operator $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ to map to a simple multiplication by a constant ($-i\\omega$), as the exponential function $e^{-i\\omega t}$ is an eigenfunction of the linear, time-invariant differentiation operator.\n\n-   **Superposition**: A direct consequence of linearity. The superposition principle allows any arbitrary signal to be decomposed into a sum (or integral) of sinusoidal components via Fourier analysis. The total response of the LTI system is then the sum of its responses to each individual sinusoidal component. This justifies analyzing the system's behavior at a single representative frequency $\\omega$, as specified by the \"narrowband approximation\".\n\n-   **Causality**: The principle that the effect cannot precede its cause. In frequency domain analysis, causality is captured by the analytical properties of the system's response functions (e.g., permittivity $\\epsilon(\\omega)$ or conductivity $\\sigma(\\omega)$), which must satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relations. In this problem, treating $\\epsilon$, $\\mu$, and $\\sigma$ as frequency-local real constants is an idealization. A more complete model combines the effects of polarization and conduction into a single complex permittivity, $\\epsilon_c(\\omega) = \\epsilon(\\omega) + i\\frac{\\sigma(\\omega)}{\\omega}$. The imaginary part represents dissipation (loss) and is fundamentally linked to the real part by causality. The phasor formalism correctly handles these effects by allowing for complex response functions.\n\nIn summary, the phasor method is a powerful tool because it transforms linear ordinary or partial differential equations with constant coefficients in the time domain into simpler algebraic equations in the frequency domain. Its validity is rigorously founded on the LTI nature of the system.\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Vector Helmholtz Equation and Dispersion Relation\n\nWe begin with the phasor-domain curl equations derived in Part 1 for a homogeneous medium:\n(1) $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = i\\omega\\mu\\mathbf{H}$\n(2) $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = (\\sigma - i\\omega\\epsilon)\\mathbf{E}$\n\nTo derive a wave equation for the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, we take the curl of equation (1):\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = \\nabla \\times (i\\omega\\mu\\mathbf{H})\n$$\nSince $\\omega$ and $\\mu$ are constants (due to time-invariance and homogeneity), they can be moved outside the curl operator:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = i\\omega\\mu(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H})\n$$\nNow, substitute equation (2) for $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H}$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = i\\omega\\mu [(\\sigma - i\\omega\\epsilon)\\mathbf{E}]\n$$\nDistributing the terms on the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = (i\\omega\\mu\\sigma - i^2\\omega^2\\mu\\epsilon)\\mathbf{E} = (\\omega^2\\mu\\epsilon + i\\omega\\mu\\sigma)\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nNext, we apply the vector calculus identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2\\mathbf{A}$ to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) - \\nabla^2\\mathbf{E} = (\\omega^2\\mu\\epsilon + i\\omega\\mu\\sigma)\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nTo simplify this, we must evaluate $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}$. The problem states the region is \"source-free\", implying $\\rho_f = 0$. From Gauss's law in the phasor domain, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho_f = 0$. For a homogeneous medium ($\\epsilon$ is constant), this gives $\\epsilon(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) = 0$, which implies $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$. This condition states that the electric field is solenoidal.\n\nWith $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} = 0$, the $\\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E})$ term vanishes, and the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n- \\nabla^2\\mathbf{E} = (\\omega^2\\mu\\epsilon + i\\omega\\mu\\sigma)\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form of the vector Helmholtz equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2\\mathbf{E} + (\\omega^2\\mu\\epsilon + i\\omega\\mu\\sigma)\\mathbf{E} = 0\n$$\nThis equation describes wave propagation. A uniform plane wave solution takes the form $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{E}_0 e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the complex wave vector. Substituting this into the Helmholtz equation yields:\n$$\n\\nabla^2( \\mathbf{E}_0 e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}} ) = (i k_x)^2 + (i k_y)^2 + (i k_z)^2 \\mathbf{E} = -(k_x^2 + k_y^2 + k_z^2)\\mathbf{E} = -k^2\\mathbf{E}\n$$\nwhere $k^2 = \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}$ is the squared magnitude of the wave vector. The Helmholtz equation thus becomes an algebraic equation:\n$$\n-k^2\\mathbf{E} + (\\omega^2\\mu\\epsilon + i\\omega\\mu\\sigma)\\mathbf{E} = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($\\mathbf{E} \\neq 0$), the scalar coefficient must be zero. This gives the dispersion relation, which connects the wavenumber $k$ to the frequency $\\omega$ and the properties of the medium:\n$$\n-k^2 + \\omega^2\\mu\\epsilon + i\\omega\\mu\\sigma = 0\n$$\nSolving for the squared complex wavenumber $k^2$, we obtain the final result:\n$$\nk^2 = \\omega^2\\mu\\epsilon + i\\omega\\mu\\sigma\n$$\nThis expression is the dispersion relation for uniform plane waves in a homogeneous, isotropic, linear conducting medium. The real part of $k^2$ is related to energy storage (as in a lossless dielectric), while the imaginary part is related to energy dissipation due to Ohmic conduction.",

            "problem": "A finite-volume discretization of Maxwell's equations is used in a three-dimensional Cartesian simulation of magnetized fusion plasmas, with a structured grid of cells indexed by $(i,j,k)$ and uniform spacings $\\Delta x$, $\\Delta y$, and $\\Delta z$. The magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ is represented in a staggered manner: the component $B_x$ is stored as a face average on $x$-normal faces located at $(i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j,k)$, $B_y$ on $y$-normal faces at $(i,j+\\tfrac{1}{2},k)$, and $B_z$ on $z$-normal faces at $(i,j,k+\\tfrac{1}{2})$. The electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is stored as an edge average: $E_x$ on edges parallel to the $x$-axis at $(i,j+\\tfrac{1}{2},k+\\tfrac{1}{2})$, $E_y$ on edges parallel to the $y$-axis at $(i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j,k+\\tfrac{1}{2})$, and $E_z$ on edges parallel to the $z$-axis at $(i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j+\\tfrac{1}{2},k)$. This staggered arrangement is commonly referred to as a Yee mesh.\n\nYou are asked to analyze the constrained transport strategy for preserving the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field in the context of computational fusion science and engineering. Start from the integral forms of Maxwell’s equations:\n- Gauss’s law for magnetism: $\\oiint_{S} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = 0$ for any closed surface $S$.\n- Faraday’s law: $\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{S} \\mathbf{B}\\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = - \\oint_{\\partial S} \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$ for any open surface $S$ with boundary $\\partial S$.\n\nDefine the discrete divergence at cell $(i,j,k)$ as\n$$\n(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})_{i,j,k} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z}\\Big[ B_x\\big(i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j,k\\big)\\,\\Delta y \\Delta z - B_x\\big(i-\\tfrac{1}{2},j,k\\big)\\,\\Delta y \\Delta z \n+ B_y\\big(i,j+\\tfrac{1}{2},k\\big)\\,\\Delta x \\Delta z - B_y\\big(i,j-\\tfrac{1}{2},k\\big)\\,\\Delta x \\Delta z \n+ B_z\\big(i,j,k+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\big)\\,\\Delta x \\Delta y - B_z\\big(i,j,k-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\big)\\,\\Delta x \\Delta y \\Big],\n$$\nand the constrained transport update of face-centered $\\mathbf{B}$ via the discrete curl of edge-centered $\\mathbf{E}$ by applying a line integral around each face, consistent with Faraday’s law and the orientations of each face and its bounding edges:\n$$\nB_f^{n+1} = B_f^{n} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{A_f} \\sum_{e \\in \\partial f} \\sigma_{f,e}\\, E_e^n\\, L_e,\n$$\nwhere $f$ denotes a face, $e$ an edge belonging to the boundary of $f$, $A_f$ the face area, $L_e$ the edge length, and $\\sigma_{f,e} \\in \\{+1,-1\\}$ encodes the relative orientation between the face circulation direction and the edge direction. Assume periodic boundary conditions or perfectly conducting walls such that the boundary terms are treated consistently with the constrained transport update.\n\nUsing only the stated integral laws and these discrete operators, derive from first principles why the constrained transport update preserves the discrete divergence of $\\mathbf{B}$ exactly in every interior cell at all time steps, and therefore maintains $(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})_{i,j,k} = 0$ if it is initially zero. Your derivation should explicitly track oriented sums over faces and edges and explain the cancellation responsible for the result.\n\nThen, answer the following multiple-choice question by selecting all correct statements about divergence preservation and staggered discretizations:\n\nA. With face-centered $\\mathbf{B}$ and edge-centered $\\mathbf{E}$, if the magnetic field update uses the discrete line integral consistent with Stokes’s theorem for every face, the discrete divergence in every interior cell is preserved exactly for all time steps (up to boundary handling), provided the initial discrete divergence is zero.\n\nB. Using cell-centered $\\mathbf{B}$ and cell-centered $\\mathbf{E}$ with componentwise central-difference approximations of the curl preserves the discrete divergence exactly, because the analytic identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = 0$ holds pointwise.\n\nC.

On a uniform logically rectangular grid, if the constrained transport update is performed on a staggered (Yee) mesh and the same edge electromotive force is used consistently by all adjacent faces (for example, computed from a Riemann-solver-consistent average of face fluxes), then the discrete divergence is preserved to within roundoff error, independent of material constitutive properties, as long as the initial discrete divergence is zero.\n\nE.

The solution will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Divergence Preservation\n\nThe core task is to demonstrate that if the discrete divergence is zero at time step $n$, it remains zero at time step $n+1$. This means we must show that $(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n+1}_{i,j,k} = (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n}_{i,j,k}$.\n\nLet's begin with the definition of the discrete divergence at cell $(i,j,k)$ provided in the problem. This can be recognized as the discrete version of Gauss's law for magnetism, applied to the control volume of cell $(i,j,k)$. Let $V_{cell} = \\Delta x \\Delta y \\Delta z$ be the cell volume. The discrete divergence is the net magnetic flux out of the cell, divided by the cell volume.\n$$\n(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})_{i,j,k} = \\frac{1}{V_{cell}} \\oiint_{\\partial C_{i,j,k}} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nwhere the integral is discretized as a sum of fluxes over the six faces of the cell $C_{i,j,k}$:\n$$\n\\oiint_{\\partial C_{i,j,k}} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} \\equiv \\sum_{f \\in \\partial C_{i,j,k}} (B_f \\cdot n_f) A_f\n$$\nHere, $f$ denotes one of the six faces bounding cell $C_{i,j,k}$, $A_f$ is the area of face $f$, and $B_f$ is the face-averaged magnetic field component normal to the face. The term $(B_f \\cdot n_f)$ corresponds to the specific component at the specific face location from the problem statement (e.g., $B_x(i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j,k)$ for the face with outward normal in the $+x$ direction). The signs in the problem's formula for $(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})$ correctly implement the outward flux calculation.\n\nLet's find the discrete divergence at the next time step, $n+1$:\n$$\n(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n+1}_{i,j,k} = \\frac{1}{V_{cell}} \\sum_{f \\in \\partial C_{i,j,k}} (B_f^{n+1} \\cdot n_f) A_f\n$$\nNow, substitute the constrained transport update rule for each $B_f^{n+1}$:\n$$\nB_f^{n+1} = B_f^{n} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{A_f} \\sum_{e \\in \\partial f} \\sigma_{f,e}\\, E_e^n\\, L_e\n$$\nNote that $\\sum_{e \\in \\partial f} \\sigma_{f,e}\\, E_e^n\\, L_e$ is the discrete line integral, or electromotive force (EMF), around the boundary of face $f$, which we denote as $\\oint_{\\partial f} \\mathbf{E}^n \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$. The sign $\\sigma_{f,e}$ is chosen to respect the right-hand rule relating the direction of circulation around $\\partial f$ and the face normal vector.\nSubstituting the update rule into the expression for the divergence at $n+1$:\n$$\n(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n+1}_{i,j,k} = \\frac{1}{V_{cell}} \\sum_{f \\in \\partial C_{i,j,k}} A_f \\left( B_f^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{A_f} \\oint_{\\partial f} \\mathbf{E}^n \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n+1}_{i,j,k} = \\frac{1}{V_{cell}} \\sum_{f \\in \\partial C_{i,j,k}} A_f B_f^n - \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_{cell}} \\sum_{f \\in \\partial C_{i,j,k}} \\oint_{\\partial f} \\mathbf{E}^n \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}\n$$\nThe first term on the right-hand side is simply the discrete divergence at time $n$:\n$$\n(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n+1}_{i,j,k} = (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n}_{i,j,k} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{V_{cell}} \\sum_{f \\in \\partial C_{i,j,k}} \\oint_{\\partial f} \\mathbf{E}^n \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}\n$$\nTo prove that divergence is preserved, we must show that the second term is identically zero:\n$$\n\\sum_{f \\in \\partial C_{i,j,k}} \\oint_{\\partial f} \\mathbf{E}^n \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = 0\n$$\nThis is a sum of six line integrals, one for each face of the cubic cell $C_{i,j,k}$. Let's analyze the contributions from the edges. The cell $C_{i,j,k}$ has $12$ edges. Each of these edges is shared by exactly two of the six faces on the cell's boundary.\n\nConsider an arbitrary edge $e_0$ on the boundary of cell $C_{i,j,k}$. Let this edge be shared by two adjacent faces, $f_1$ and $f_2$, which are both part of the boundary $\\partial C_{i,j,k}$. The electric field on this edge is $E_{e_0}$. Its length is $L_{e_0}$.\nThe term for edge $e_0$ will appear twice in the total sum: once in the line integral for $f_1$ and once for $f_2$.\n$$\n\\sum_{f \\in \\partial C_{i,j,k}} \\oint_{\\partial f} \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = \\dots + (\\text{contribution from } e_0 \\text{ in } \\oint_{\\partial f_1}) + (\\text{contribution from } e_0 \\text{ in } \\oint_{\\partial f_2}) + \\dots\n$$\nThe orientation of the line integral $\\oint_{\\partial f}$ for each face is determined by the right-hand rule with respect to the outward-pointing normal of that face.\nLet's take a concrete example. Consider the edge parallel to the $z$-axis at location $(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}, j+\\tfrac{1}{2}, k)$. It carries the electric field component $E_z(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}, j+\\tfrac{1}{2}, k)$. This edge is shared by the face $f_x$ at $(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}, j, k)$ and the face $f_y$ at $(i, j+\\tfrac{1}{2}, k)$.\n1.  For face $f_x$ at $(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}, j, k)$, the outward normal is in the $+x$ direction. By the right-hand rule, the circulation path on its boundary includes traversing our chosen edge in the $+z$ direction. Its contribution to the line integral for $f_x$ is $+ E_z(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}, j+\\tfrac{1}{2}, k) \\Delta z$.\n2.  For face $f_y$ at $(i, j+\\tfrac{1}{2}, k)$, the outward normal is in the $+y$ direction. By the right-hand rule, the circulation path on its boundary includes traversing our chosen edge in the $-z$ direction. Its contribution to the line integral for $f_y$ is $- E_z(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}, j+\\tfrac{1}{2}, k) \\Delta z$.\n\nThe sum of the contributions from this single edge $E_z(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}, j+\\tfrac{1}{2}, k)$ to the total sum over all faces is:\n$$\n+E_z(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}, j+\\tfrac{1}{2}, k)\\Delta z - E_z(i+\\tfrac{1}{2}, j+\\tfrac{1}{2}, k)\\Delta z = 0\n$$\nThis cancellation occurs because any given edge on the surface of the cell is traversed in opposite directions when considered as part of the boundaries of the two adjacent faces it separates. Since this holds for all $12$ edges of the cell, the sum of all edge contributions is zero. Every edge's electromotive force $E_e L_e$ appears exactly twice in the sum, with opposite signs.\n\nTherefore, we have proven:\n$$\n\\sum_{f \\in \\partial C_{i,j,k}} \\oint_{\\partial f} \\mathbf{E}^n \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = 0\n$$\nThis is a discrete analogue of the vector calculus identity $\\oiint_S (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} = 0$ for any closed surface $S$. The staggering of variables in the Yee mesh ensures this identity holds exactly at the discrete level.\n\nThis leads to the final result for the time evolution of the discrete divergence:\n$$\n(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n+1}_{i,j,k} = (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n}_{i,j,k} - 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n+1}_{i,j,k} = (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^{n}_{i,j,k}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the constrained transport update scheme preserves the discrete divergence of the magnetic field in every cell for all time. If the initial condition satisfies $(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^0_{i,j,k} = 0$, then $(\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{B})^n_{i,j,k} = 0$ for all $n > 0$, up to floating-point roundoff error.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. With face-centered B and edge-centered E, if the magnetic field update uses the discrete line integral consistent with Stokes’s theorem for every face, the discrete divergence in every interior cell is preserved exactly for all time steps (up to boundary handling), provided the initial discrete divergence is zero.**\n**Correct.** This statement accurately summarizes the result of the derivation above. The Yee mesh (face-centered $\\mathbf{B}$, edge-centered $\\mathbf{E}$) and the constrained transport update (discrete line integral) are precisely the ingredients that lead to the exact, geometric cancellation, thus preserving the discrete divergence.\n\n**B. Using cell-centered B and cell-centered E with componentwise central-difference approximations of the curl preserves the discrete divergence exactly, because the analytic identity $\\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = 0$ holds pointwise.**\n**Incorrect.** This describes a collocated grid scheme. While it is true that for standard central-difference operators $(\\delta)$ on a uniform grid, the identity $\\delta_x \\delta_y = \\delta_y \\delta_x$ holds, leading to a formal cancellation in $\\nabla_h \\cdot (\\nabla_h \\times \\mathbf{E}) = 0$, such schemes are notoriously problematic. They are susceptible to numerical instabilities, such as odd-even decoupling (checkerboard modes), where non-physical, high-frequency oscillations can exist in the solution while having zero derivative according to the central-difference stencil. This makes the \"preservation\" of divergence non-robust. The staggered grid of the Yee scheme was specifically invented to overcome these issues. Furthermore, the reasoning \"because the analytic identity... holds pointwise\" is a flawed argument, as it conflates continuous properties with discrete ones without justification.\n\n**C. Constrained transport requires storing the electric field on cell faces; placing E on edges causes divergence preservation to fail.**\n**Incorrect.** This statement is directly contradicted by the problem description and the derivation. The problem sets up a Yee mesh with $\\mathbf{E}$ on edges and asks to prove divergence preservation, which we have just done. Therefore, placing $\\mathbf{E}$ on edges not only works, it is the standard and correct approach for this type of staggered grid.\n\n**D. On a uniform logically rectangular grid, if the constrained transport update is performed on a staggered (Yee) mesh and the same edge electromotive force is used consistently by all adjacent faces (for example, computed from a Riemann-solver-consistent average of face fluxes), then the discrete divergence is preserved to within roundoff error, independent of material constitutive properties, as long as the initial discrete divergence is zero.**\n**Correct.** This is a more detailed and computationally precise version of statement A. It correctly identifies the crucial condition for the cancellation: that the *same* edge electromotive force value ($E_e L_e$) is used in the update for all faces sharing that edge. The mention of \"preserved to within roundoff error\" is a practical acknowledgement of finite-precision arithmetic, which is more rigorous than \"exactly\". Finally, it correctly notes that the cancellation is a purely geometric/topological property of the scheme and is therefore independent of material properties (like $\\mu$ or $\\epsilon$) which determine the *values* of $\\mathbf{E}$, but not the structure of the update based on Faraday's law.\n\n**E. In media with spatially varying magnetic permeability, constrained transport cannot preserve $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$ because the divergence-free condition applies to $\\mathbf{H}$ rather than $\\mathbf{B}$ when $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H}$.**\n**Incorrect.** This statement is flawed for two fundamental reasons. First, Gauss's law for magnetism, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, is a universal law of physics, valid in all materials, irrespective of whether the magnetic permeability $\\mu$ is constant or spatially varying. The field that is fundamentally divergence-free is $\\mathbf{B}$, not $\\mathbf{H}$. Second, as established in the derivation and in the analysis of option D, the divergence-preservation property of constrained transport is a consequence of the geometric structure of the discretization of Faraday's Law ($\\partial \\mathbf{B}/\\partial t = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}$) and is independent of the constitutive relation $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H}$.",
