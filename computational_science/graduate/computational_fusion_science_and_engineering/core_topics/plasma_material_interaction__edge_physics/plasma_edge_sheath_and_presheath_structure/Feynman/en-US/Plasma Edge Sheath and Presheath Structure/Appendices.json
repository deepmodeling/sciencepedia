            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the ion-acoustic speed in a quasineutral plasma with adiabatic ions, the statement of the sheath-edge (Bohm) criterion, and the calculation of the minimum ion flow speed at the sheath edge for a specific deuterium plasma.\n\nThe one-dimensional, collisionless plasma is described by the following set of equations:\n1.  Ion continuity equation:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (n_i v_i)}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n2.  Ion momentum equation:\n    $$ m_i n_i \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial t} + v_i \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x} \\right) = -Z e n_i \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial p_i}{\\partial x} $$\n3.  Electron Boltzmann relation (for inertialess electrons):\n    $$ n_e = n_{e0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{e \\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\n4.  Adiabatic closure for ions:\n    $$ p_i = C n_i^{\\gamma_i} $$\n    where $C$ is a constant. This implies $\\frac{\\partial p_i}{\\partial x} = \\gamma_i \\frac{p_i}{n_i} \\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial x}$. Using the ideal gas law form $p_i = n_i k_B T_i$, this becomes $\\frac{\\partial p_i}{\\partial x} = \\gamma_i k_B T_i \\frac{\\partial n_i}{\\partial x}$.\n5.  Quasineutrality in the presheath: For singly charged ions ($Z=1$), this is $n_i = n_e = n$.\n\nFirst, we derive the phase speed of ion-acoustic perturbations in the quasineutral presheath. We linearize the equations around a spatially uniform equilibrium state characterized by density $n_0$, ion flow velocity $v_0$, and potential $\\phi_0=0$. We consider small perturbations of the form $n = n_0 + n_1$, $v_i = v_0 + v_1$, and $\\phi = \\phi_0 + \\phi_1 = \\phi_1$, where the perturbed quantities vary as $\\exp[i(kx - \\omega t)]$.\n\nFrom the quasineutrality condition $n_i=n_e$ and the Boltzmann relation, we linearize to find a relationship between the perturbed density $n_1$ and the perturbed potential $\\phi_1$.\n$$ n_0 + n_1 = n_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi_1}{k_B T_e}\\right) \\approx n_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{e\\phi_1}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\nThis yields $n_1 = n_0 \\frac{e\\phi_1}{k_B T_e}$, which implies $e \\frac{\\partial \\phi_1}{\\partial x} = \\frac{k_B T_e}{n_0} \\frac{\\partial n_1}{\\partial x}$.\n\nThe linearized ion continuity and momentum equations yield a dispersion relation for the perturbations. By combining the linearized equations and transforming to Fourier space, one arrives at:\n$$ m_i \\frac{(\\omega - kv_0)^2}{k^2} = k_B T_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i $$\nThe term $(\\omega - kv_0)/k$ is the phase speed of the wave in the frame moving with the ion fluid. The phase speed of ion-acoustic perturbations, denoted as $c_s$, is therefore given by:\n$$ c_s^2 = \\frac{k_B T_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i} \\implies c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i}} $$\n\nNext, we state the sheath-edge condition, known as the Bohm criterion. For a stable, monotonic potential drop to form in the non-neutral sheath, the ion flow speed $v_s$ at the sheath edge must be at least the ion-acoustic speed. This condition ensures that the space charge in the sheath has the correct sign to shield the negative wall potential. A rigorous derivation involves analyzing Poisson's equation, $\\epsilon_0 d^2\\phi/dx^2 = e(n_e - n_i)$, at the sheath edge. The requirement that space charge density increases with a small drop in potential (i.e., $d(n_i-n_e)/d\\phi > 0$ for $\\phi<0$) leads to the generalized Bohm criterion:\n$$ v_s \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i}} $$\nThus, the sheath-edge condition on the ion flow speed is $v_s \\geq c_s$, where $c_s$ is the ion-acoustic speed derived above. The minimum ion flow speed at the sheath edge is exactly $c_s$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for this minimum speed. The minimum speed $v_{min}$ is:\n$$ v_{min} = c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i}} $$\nThe problem provides the following parameters:\n-   Ratio of specific heats for ions: $\\gamma_i = 3$\n-   Electron temperature: $T_e = 10 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   Ion temperature: $T_i = 2 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   Mass of deuterium ion: $m_i = 3.3435837724 \\times 10^{-27} \\, \\mathrm{kg}$\n-   Elementary charge: $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\, \\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe temperatures are given in electron-volts, which represents energy. Thus, the numerator of the fraction under the square root is $k_B T_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i = (10 + 3 \\times 2)\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 16\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.
