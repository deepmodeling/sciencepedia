            "problem": "In the context of error-field-induced locked modes in a toroidal plasma, consider the resistive penetration of a slowly varying magnetic perturbation into a thin tearing layer of characteristic radial width $\\delta$. Assume the plasma is stationary within the layer, the electrical resistivity $\\eta$ is uniform, and flow, Hall, and pressure-gradient effects are negligible. Starting from Maxwell–Faraday's law $\\partial \\mathbf{B}/\\partial t = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}$, Ampère's law without displacement current $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J}$, Ohm's law $\\mathbf{E} = \\eta \\mathbf{J}$, and Gauss's law for magnetism $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{B} = 0$, derive the one-dimensional resistive magnetic diffusion equation across the layer for a single Cartesian coordinate $x$ and identify the resistive diffusion coefficient.

            "solution": "We start with Maxwell-Faraday's law:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}\n$$\nThe problem states that flow is negligible, so the electromotive force $\\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}$ is absent. The provided form of Ohm's law is $\\mathbf{E} = \\eta \\mathbf{J}$. Substituting this into Faraday's law yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\times (\\eta \\mathbf{J})\n$$\nSince the resistivity $\\eta$ is assumed to be uniform, it can be taken out of the curl operator:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = -\\eta (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J})\n$$\nNext, we use Ampère's law (neglecting the displacement current, which is an excellent approximation for the slow phenomena considered), $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu_{0} \\mathbf{J}$, to eliminate the current density $\\mathbf{J}$. Rearranging for $\\mathbf{J}$ gives $\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{0}} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}$.

The problem specifies a one-dimensional treatment across the tearing layer using the coordinate $x$, which implies that spatial variations are dominated by the derivative in the $x$ direction. Thus, the Laplacian operator simplifies to $\\nabla^2 \\approx \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a classical diffusion equation, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$. By comparison, we identify the resistive diffusion coefficient, often denoted $D_m$ or $D_R$, as:\n$$\nD_m = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0}}\n$$\n\nThe derived equation describes how the magnetic field evolves due to resistive diffusion. To determine the condition for an external field to penetrate the layer, we use a timescale argument. The characteristic time $\\tau_R$ for the magnetic field to diffuse across a region of thickness $\\delta$ is given by the dimensional scaling of the diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\tau_R \\sim \\frac{(\\text{length scale})^2}{\\text{diffusion coefficient}} = \\frac{\\delta^2}{D_m} = \\frac{\\mu_{0} \\delta^2}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis is the resistive diffusion time. The externally applied magnetic perturbation is harmonic with an angular frequency $\\omega$. The characteristic timescale of this perturbation is $\\tau_{pert} = 1/\\omega$.\n\nFor the magnetic field to penetrate the resistive layer, the perturbation must persist for a time longer than or comparable to the time it takes for the field to diffuse through the layer. If the perturbation changes too rapidly (i.e., $\\tau_{pert} \\ll \\tau_R$), the plasma inside the layer behaves as a near-perfect conductor, and induced currents will flow to shield the external field, preventing its penetration (a phenomenon analogous to the skin effect). Conversely, if the perturbation varies slowly ($\\tau_{pert} \\gtrsim \\tau_R$), there is sufficient time for the field to \"leak\" or diffuse through the resistive plasma.\n\nTherefore, the condition for resistive field penetration is:\n$$\n\\tau_{pert} \\gtrsim \\tau_R \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\gtrsim \\frac{\\mu_{0} \\delta^2}{\\eta}\n$$\nRearranging this inequality to solve for $\\omega$, we find:\n$$\n\\omega \\lesssim \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0} \\delta^2}\n$$\nThe problem statement defines a critical angular frequency $\\omega_c$ such that penetration occurs for $\\omega < \\omega_c$. Based on the derived condition, this critical frequency is the inverse of the resistive diffusion time. The analytic expression for $\\omega_c$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{\\tau_R} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_{0} \\delta^2}\n$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\eta = 3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\delta = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\mu_{0} = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for $\\omega_c$:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}}{ (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\times (3 \\times 10^{-3})^2 }\n$$\nFirst, calculate the square of the layer width:\n$$\n\\delta^2 = (3 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 9 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the denominator:\n$$\n\\mu_{0} \\delta^2 = (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{H/m}) \\times (9 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) = 36\\pi \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{H}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nFinally, compute the value of $\\omega_c$:\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}}{36\\pi \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{H}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{3}{36\\pi} \\times 10^{-6 - (-13)}\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mathrm{H}}\n$$\nThe units are $\\Omega / \\mathrm{H} = \\Omega / (\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{s}) = 1/\\mathrm{s}$, which corresponds to radians per second, as expected for an angular frequency.\n$$\n\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{12\\pi} \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value:\n$$\n\\omega_c \\approx \\frac{1}{12 \\times 3.14159} \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx \\frac{1}{37.6991} \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega_c \\approx 0.0265258 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 265258\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\omega_c \\approx 2.65 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$",

            "solution": "We begin by establishing the first principles for the propagation of uncertainty from the safety factor profile, $q(r)$, to the radial location of a rational surface, $r_s$. A rational surface is defined by the implicit equation $q(r_s) = q_{target}$, where $q_{target} = m/n$ for integers $m$ and $n$. Let the true profile be $q(r)$ and the true location of the surface be $r_s$. A perturbed or uncertain profile, $\\tilde{q}(r)$, will yield a perturbed location, $\\tilde{r}_s = r_s + \\delta r_s$. The perturbed quantities satisfy $\\tilde{q}(\\tilde{r}_s) = q_{target}$.\n\nLet the perturbation in the $q$ profile be $\\delta q(r)$, such that $\\tilde{q}(r) = q(r) + \\delta q(r)$.

Thus, the standard deviation in the surface location is:\n$$ \\sigma_{r_s} \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_q}{|q'(r_s)|} \\quad (**) $$\nBoth equations $(*)$ and $(**)$ show that the uncertainty in the surface location, $r_s$, is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic shear, $|q'(r_s)|$, at that surface.\n\nNext, we apply this framework to the given equilibrium. The safety factor profile is:\n$$ q(r) = q_0 + \\alpha \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2 = 1.0 + 1.8 \\left(\\frac{r}{0.6}\\right)^2 $$\nThis can be simplified to $q(r) = 1.0 + \\frac{1.8}{0.36} r^2 = 1.0 + 5r^2$, where $r$ is in meters. The magnetic shear is its derivative:\n$$ q'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}(1.0 + 5r^2) = 10r $$\nThe problem states that $q(r)$ is monotonically increasing, which is consistent with $q'(r) = 10r > 0$ for $r > 0$.\n\nLet us find the locations $r_s$ and shear values $q'(r_s)$ for the two surfaces of interest.\n\nFor the $q=2$ surface ($q_{target}=2$):\n$$ 2.0 = 1.0 + 5 r_s^2 \\implies 5 r_s^2 = 1.0 \\implies r_s^2 = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 $$\n$$ r_s(q=2) = \\sqrt{0.2} \\approx 0.4472\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe shear at this location is:\n$$ q'(r_s(q=2)) = 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.2} \\approx 4.472\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\n\nFor the $q=3/2$ surface ($q_{target}=1.5$):\n$$ 1.5 = 1.0 + 5 r_s^2 \\implies 5 r_s^2 = 0.5 \\implies r_s^2 = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 $$\n$$ r_s(q=3/2) = \\sqrt{0.1} \\approx 0.3162\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe shear at this location is:\n$$ q'(r_s(q=3/2)) = 10 \\times \\sqrt{0.1} \\approx 3.162\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} $$\nAs expected, the magnetic shear is lower at the $q=3/2$ surface, which is located further inside the plasma than the $q=2$ surface.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. The first-order radial mislocation of a rational surface due to a local perturbation $\\delta q$ is $\\delta r_s \\approx -\\delta q/q'(r_s)$, so lower magnetic shear $q'(r_s)$ implies larger $|\\delta r_s|$. With the given parameters and $\\delta q_0 = +0.05$, the $q=3/2$ surface is mislocated by a larger magnitude than the $q=2$ surface.**\nThe first part of the statement, $\\delta r_s \\approx -\\delta q/q'(r_s)$, is identical to our derived equation $(*)$ and the conclusion that lower shear implies larger mislocation magnitude is a direct consequence. This is correct.\nThe problem states a uniform bias $\\delta q_0 = +0.05$, which represents the perturbation $\\delta q$. We calculate the mislocation $\\delta r_s$ for both surfaces:\nFor $q=2$:\n$$ \\delta r_s(q=2) \\approx - \\frac{0.05}{q'(r_s(q=2))} \\approx - \\frac{0.05}{4.472} \\approx -0.0112\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nFor $q=3/2$:\n$$ \\delta r_s(q=3/2) \\approx - \\frac{0.05}{q'(r_s(q=3/2))} \\approx - \\frac{0.05}{3.162} \\approx -0.0158\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nComparing the magnitudes of the mislocations:\n$|\\delta r_s(q=3/2)| \\approx 0.0158\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $|\\delta r_s(q=2)| \\approx 0.0112\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nSince $0.0158 > 0.0112$, the $q=3/2$ surface is indeed mislocated by a larger magnitude.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The random-error-induced standard deviation in the surface location is approximately $\\sigma_{r_s} \\approx \\sigma_q/|q'(r_s)|$. Numerically, $\\sigma_{r_s} \\approx 0.0067\\,\\mathrm{m}$ at $q=2$ and $\\sigma_{r_s} \\approx 0.0095\\,\\mathrm{m}$ at $q=3/2$, so the $q=3/2$ surface has larger random mislocation than the $q=2$ surface.**\nThe formula $\\sigma_{r_s} \\approx \\sigma_q/|q'(r_s)|$ matches our derived equation $(**)$. This is correct.\nWe are given $\\sigma_q = 0.03$. We calculate the numerical values for $\\sigma_{r_s}$:\nFor $q=2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{r_s}(q=2) \\approx \\frac{0.03}{|q'(r_s(q=2))|} \\approx \\frac{0.03}{4.472} \\approx 0.00671\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThis value is consistent with the stated $\\sigma_{r_s} \\approx 0.0067\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nFor $q=3/2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{r_s}(q=3/2) \\approx \\frac{0.03}{|q'(r_s(q=3/2))|} \\approx \\frac{0.03}{3.162} \\approx 0.00949\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThis value is consistent with the stated $\\sigma_{r_s} \\approx 0.0095\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe statement concludes that the $q=3/2$ surface has larger random mislocation because $0.0095\\,\\mathrm{m} > 0.0067\\,\\mathrm{m}$. This is true and follows from the fact that the magnetic shear is lower at the $q=3/2$ surface.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. For locking analysis, a first-order error in the predicted resonant torque $T$ due to surface mislocation scales as $\\delta T \\approx (\\partial T/\\partial r)|_{r_s}\\,\\delta r_s$. Consequently, regions of low magnetic shear $q'(r_s)$ amplify uncertainty in $T$ because they produce large $|\\delta r_s|$ for a given $\\delta q$.**\nThe first part of the statement correctly expresses the first-order Taylor expansion of a torque function $T(r)$ around a nominal radius $r_s$. This is a standard method for linear error propagation.\nThe second part connects this to the results from A and B. We have established that the mislocation $\\delta r_s$ (both systematic and random) is inversely proportional to the magnetic shear, $|\\delta r_s| \\propto 1/|q'(r_s)|$. Substituting this into the error expression for torque gives:\n$$ |\\delta T| \\approx \\left| \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{r_s} \\right| |\\delta r_s| \\propto \\left| \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{r_s} \\right| \\frac{|\\delta q|}{|q'(r_s)|} $$\nThis shows that for a given uncertainty in the $q$-profile, $\\delta q$, and a given torque gradient, $\\partial T/\\partial r$, a lower value of magnetic shear $|q'(r_s)|$ leads to a larger uncertainty in the predicted torque, $|\\delta T|$. Thus, low magnetic shear amplifies the effect of $q$-profile uncertainty on torque prediction. This physical reasoning is sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. A constant positive bias $\\delta q_0$ that preserves the monotonic increase of $q(r)$ cannot cause confusion between the $q=2$ and $q=3/2$ resonances; the dominance of one resonance in locking predictions is unaffected by such a bias because the order of $q$ values is preserved.**\nA constant positive bias $\\delta q_0$ shifts the profile to $\\tilde{q}(r) = q(r) + \\delta q_0$. As $q(r)$ is monotonic, so is $\\tilde{q}(r)$, and the radial ordering of rational surfaces is unchanged. However, the conclusion that the \"dominance\" of a resonance in locking predictions is unaffected is physically incorrect. The tendency for a mode to lock depends critically on the physical conditions at its specific radial location, $r_s$. These conditions include the local plasma rotation, temperature, density, and the magnitude of the resonant component of the external error field. A bias $\\delta q_0$ systematically shifts the radial positions of all rational surfaces. As we calculated in A, the $q=2$ and $q=3/2$ surfaces shift inward by approximately $1.1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $1.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, respectively. This shift can move a surface from a region of fast rotation to one of slow rotation (or vice-versa), altering the balance between the viscous torque and the electromagnetic torque from the error field. This can change which mode is predicted to be the most unstable or the first to lock. The argument \"because the order of $q$ values is preserved\" is a non-sequitur; it has no bearing on the physical locking conditions at the new locations.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

We can rearrange the equation above to solve for $I_d$:\n$$\nI_d = S \\times (w_i - w_f)\n$$\nThis is the derived relation between the driven current and the reduction in the island's steady-state half-width.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this equation.\nThe initial half-width is the saturated width in the absence of external drive:\n$w_i = w_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe target half-width is:\n$w_f = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe stabilization coefficient is:\n$S = 50\\,\\mathrm{A/cm}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required reduction in width, $\\Delta w$:\n$$\n\\Delta w = w_i - w_f = 5\\,\\mathrm{cm} - 2\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 3\\,\\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nNext, we use the derived relation to compute the required driven current, $I_d$:\n$$\nI_d = S \\times \\Delta w = (50\\,\\mathrm{A/cm}) \\times (3\\,\\mathrm{cm})\n$$\nThe units of centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$) cancel, yielding the current in amperes ($\\mathrm{A}$).\n$$\nI_d = 150\\,\\mathrm{A}\n$$\nThus, a driven current of $150\\,\\mathrm{A}$ is required to reduce the steady-state island half-width from $5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ to $2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, under the given linear response model.",
