This exercise guides you through a practical estimation to determine if a current sheet, under conditions relevant to fusion devices, will disrupt via the plasmoid instability while its thickness is still governed by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), or if it will first thin to kinetic scales where a fluid description breaks down. By comparing the sheet thickness at the onset of instability to fundamental plasma length scales , you will develop a physical intuition for the regimes where different models of reconnection are applicable.",

            "problem": "A planar, reconnecting current sheet is forming in a high-temperature plasma relevant to computational fusion science and engineering. The upstream plasma is uniform, with magnetic field magnitude $B_0 = 0.10$ T, ion number density $n_i = 5.0 \\times 10^{19} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, and deuterium ions with mass $m_i = 2 m_p$, where $m_p$ is the proton mass.

All concepts, definitions, and parameters are standard in plasma physics and computational fusion science.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to compute a unique numerical value for the ratio $R$. The phrase \"standard linear plasmoid criterion\" refers to the well-known result that plasmoids form when the Lundquist number $S$ exceeds a critical value, typically $S_c \\sim 10^4$. The problem is structured such that the Lundquist number calculated from the given parameters represents this critical value at the onset of instability, thus making the problem solvable and self-contained.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The problem statement is precise, quantitative, and free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent set of information. A reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the dimensionless ratio $R = a_{\\mathrm{on}} / d_{\\min}$. This requires determining the current sheet half-thickness at the onset of the plasmoid instability, $a_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and the minimum relevant kinetic scale, $d_{\\min}$.\n\nThe onset of the plasmoid instability in a Sweet-Parker-like current sheet occurs when the Lundquist number, $S$, exceeds a critical value, $S_c \\approx 10^4$. The problem provides a set of physical parameters that define a specific state of the system. We will calculate the Lundquist number $S$ for this state. If the calculated $S$ is of the order of $10^4$, it is logical to conclude that the given parameters describe the system at the moment of onset. The onset thickness, $a_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is then the Sweet-Parker half-thickness $a_{\\mathrm{SP}}$ corresponding to this value of $S$.\n\nFirst, we assemble the necessary constants:\n- Vacuum permeability: $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{T \\cdot m / A}$\n- Proton mass: $m_p \\approx 1.6726 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Electron mass: $m_e \\approx 9.1094 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Elementary charge: $e \\approx 1.6022 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe ion mass for deuterium is $m_i = 2 m_p \\approx 3.3452 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in the following steps:\n1.  Calculate the upstream Alfvén speed, $V_A$.\n2.  Calculate the Lundquist number, $S$.\n3.  Calculate the instability onset thickness, $a_{\\mathrm{on}} = L / \\sqrt{S}$.\n4.  Calculate the ion and electron skin depths, $d_i$ and $d_e$, to identify $d_{\\min}$.\n5.  Compute the ratio $R = a_{\\mathrm{on}} / d_{\\min}$.\n\n**1. Alfvén Speed Calculation**\nUsing the given definition $V_A = B_0 / \\sqrt{\\mu_0 n_i m_i}$:\n$$ \\mu_0 n_i m_i = (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (5.0 \\times 10^{19}) (2 \\times 1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}) \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3} $$\n$$ \\mu_0 n_i m_i \\approx 2.1018 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3} $$\n$$ V_A = \\frac{0.10}{\\sqrt{2.1018 \\times 10^{-13}}} \\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\approx \\frac{0.10}{4.5846 \\times 10^{-7}} \\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 2.181 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\n\n**2. Lundquist Number Calculation**\nUsing the definition $S = \\mu_0 L V_A / \\eta$:\n$$ S = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (0.20) (2.181 \\times 10^5)}{2.0 \\times 10^{-6}} $$\n$$ S \\approx \\frac{5.482 \\times 10^{-2}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 27410 $$\nThis value is dimensionless and falls squarely in the theoretically and numerically expected range for the critical Lundquist number $S_c \\sim 10^4$. This confirms that the given parameters describe the system at the onset of the plasmoid instability.\n\n**3. Onset Thickness Calculation**\nThe onset thickness $a_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the Sweet-Parker thickness at this Lundquist number:\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{S}} = \\frac{0.20}{\\sqrt{27410}} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx \\frac{0.20}{165.56} \\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 1.208 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\n**4. Minimum Kinetic Scale Calculation**\nThe kinetic scales are the species skin depths, $d_s = \\sqrt{m_s / (\\mu_0 n_s e^2)}$. We need to find $d_{\\min} = \\min(d_i, d_e)$.\nFirst, calculate the term $\\mu_0 n_e e^2$, noting that $n_e=n_i$:\n$$ \\mu_0 n_e e^2 = (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (5.0 \\times 10^{19}) (1.6022 \\times 10^{-19})^2 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m} $$\n$$ \\mu_0 n_e e^2 \\approx 1.613 \\times 10^{-24} \\ \\mathrm{kg/m} $$\nNow we can compute the electron skin depth $d_e$:\n$$ d_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e}{\\mu_0 n_e e^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9.1094 \\times 10^{-31}}{1.613 \\times 10^{-24}}} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ d_e \\approx \\sqrt{5.647 \\times 10^{-7}} \\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 7.515 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe ion skin depth $d_i$ is:\n$$ d_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{\\mu_0 n_i e^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m_p}{\\mu_0 n_i e^2}} = d_e \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{m_e}} = d_e \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m_p}{m_e}} $$\nSince $m_i \\gg m_e$, it is clear that $d_i \\gg d_e$. Therefore, the minimum kinetic scale is the electron skin depth:\n$$ d_{\\min} = d_e \\approx 7.515 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\n**5. Ratio Calculation**\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{on}}}{d_{\\min}} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{on}}}{d_e} = \\frac{1.208 \\times 10^{-3}}{7.515 \\times 10^{-4}} $$\n$$ R \\approx 1.6074 $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we get $R \\approx 1.61$. The result $R>1$ indicates that the plasmoid instability is triggered when the current sheet thickness is still larger than the electron skin depth, preventing the sheet from thinning uninterruptedly into a kinetic-scale layer.",

The external drive imposes an inflow speed $U_{d}$ at the far upstream boundary, sustaining a quasi-steady reconnection configuration. Assume $S \\gg S_{c}$, where $S_{c}$ is the plasmoid-instability threshold, so that plasmoid-mediated dynamics are established.\n\nUse only foundational physical principles appropriate for this context: Faraday’s law, flux-freezing outside resistive sublayers, and mass conservation across the reconnection layer. In the plasmoid-mediated state, take as a well-tested fact that the fragmented layer self-organizes such that the local inflow into an active X-point is bounded by a dimensionless throughput parameter $\\epsilon$ of order $10^{-2}$, yielding a maximum admissible inflow $u_{\\ast} = \\epsilon v_{A}$ that is independent of the global Lundquist number $S$ when $S \\gg S_{c}$. Derive, from first principles and these stated facts, how the reconnection electric field $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ responds to changes in the external drive amplitude $U_{d}$ once plasmoid-mediated dynamics are established. Your derivation must reconcile the supply of magnetic flux from the driven upstream region with the throughput limitation of the X-point cascade.\n\nProvide a single closed-form analytic expression for $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ in terms of $U_{d}$, $B_{u}$, $v_{A}$, and $\\epsilon$, valid for all $U_{d}$ in the plasmoid-mediated regime. Express your final answer in $\\mathrm{V/m}$. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The goal is to determine the reconnection electric field $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ as a function of the external drive amplitude $U_{d}$ in a plasmoid-mediated regime. The appropriate starting point is the induction equation and Faraday’s law, together with flux-freezing in the ideal region and mass conservation across the reconnection layer.\n\nIn resistive Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the generalized Ohm’s law can be written as $\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\eta' \\mathbf{J}$, where $\\eta'$ is the electrical resistivity (with units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$) and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density. In terms of the magnetic diffusivity $\\eta_{m} = \\eta'/\\mu_{0}$, the induction equation is $\\partial_{t}\\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\left(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B} - \\eta_{m} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}\\right)$. Outside the thin resistive sublayers surrounding X-points, the plasma is effectively ideal, so the flux-freezing condition applies locally: $\\mathbf{E} \\approx -\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B}$.\n\nIn a two-dimensional reconnection geometry, the reconnection electric field is the out-of-plane component $E_{\\mathrm{rec}} = E_{z}$. In the ideal inflow region immediately upstream of the diffusion layer, the out-of-plane electric field is given by $E_{\\mathrm{rec}} = u_{\\mathrm{in}} B_{u}$, where $u_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the actual inflow speed into the reconnection layer (the speed at which magnetic flux is advected towards the X-line) and $B_{u}$ is the upstream magnetic field magnitude.\n\nThus, once $u_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is determined, $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ follows directly from flux freezing. The central question then reduces to how $u_{\\mathrm{in}}$ depends on the external drive $U_{d}$ given the presence of plasmoids.\n\nIn a supply-limited scenario (weak external drive), the boundary condition enforces an upstream inflow $U_{d}$, and the reconnection layer processes whatever flux is supplied. Provided the layer’s processing capacity is not exceeded, the actual inflow equals the supplied inflow, $u_{\\mathrm{in}} = U_{d}$. By contrast, in a throughput-limited scenario (strong external drive), the internal dynamics of the plasmoid-mediated layer limit how much flux can be reconnected per unit time, independent of $S$ for $S \\gg S_{c}$. A well-tested fact in the plasmoid-mediated regime is that the local inflow speed into active X-points saturates at a value proportional to the Alfvén speed, $u_{\\ast} = \\epsilon v_{A}$, where $\\epsilon$ is a dimensionless constant of order $10^{-2}$, reflecting the reconnection throughput established by the fragmented current sheet. This saturation arises because the layer self-organizes so that local segments operate near marginal stability with a local Lundquist number near $S_{c}$, causing the effective inflow to be $u_{\\mathrm{loc}} \\sim v_{A}/\\sqrt{S_{c}}$ up to order-unity geometric factors. These details are encapsulated in the parameter $\\epsilon$.\n\nWhen the external drive attempts to force an inflow $U_{d}$ greater than the layer’s throughput capacity $u_{\\ast}$, the actual inflow cannot exceed $u_{\\ast}$; otherwise, magnetic flux would accumulate upstream, thickening the layer and re-adjusting the configuration until the throughput limit is respected. Conversely, when $U_{d}$ is below $u_{\\ast}$, the internal throughput does not constrain the inflow, and $u_{\\mathrm{in}}$ equals the supplied $U_{d}$. These two regimes are reconciled by the bottleneck principle:\n$u_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\min\\left(U_{d},\\,u_{\\ast}\\right) = \\min\\left(U_{d},\\,\\epsilon v_{A}\\right)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the reconnection electric field from flux-freezing gives\n$E_{\\mathrm{rec}}(U_{d},B_{u},v_{A},\\epsilon) = B_{u}\\,\\min\\left(U_{d},\\,\\epsilon v_{A}\\right)$.\nThis expression is valid across the entire plasmoid-mediated regime ($S \\gg S_{c}$). For weak drive ($U_{d} \\ll \\epsilon v_{A}$), the reconnection rate responds linearly to changes in drive amplitude, $E_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx B_{u}U_{d}$. For strong drive ($U_{d} \\gg \\epsilon v_{A}$), the reconnection rate is insensitive to further increases in drive, saturating at $E_{\\mathrm{rec}} \\approx \\epsilon B_{u} v_{A}$, independent of $S$.\n\nThe units of $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ are $\\mathrm{V/m}$ because $B_{u}$ has units of $\\mathrm{T}$ and velocity has units of $\\mathrm{m/s}$, and $\\mathrm{T}\\cdot \\mathrm{m/s} = \\mathrm{V/m}$ in the ideal MHD relation $\\mathbf{E} = -\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{B}$. This completes the derivation requested.",
