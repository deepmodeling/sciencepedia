This practice provides a concrete, quantitative exercise to determine whether a reconnecting current sheet will disrupt via the MHD plasmoid instability or if it will continue to thin down to kinetic scales where a different set of physical laws takes over . By comparing the predicted sheet thickness at the onset of instability to the fundamental electron skin depth, you will gain a practical understanding of the regime criteria for this important process.",

All concepts, definitions, and parameters are standard in plasma physics and computational fusion science.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to compute a unique numerical value for the ratio $R$. The phrase \"standard linear plasmoid criterion\" refers to the well-known result that plasmoids form when the Lundquist number $S$ exceeds a critical value, typically $S_c \\sim 10^4$. The problem is structured such that the Lundquist number calculated from the given parameters represents this critical value at the onset of instability, thus making the problem solvable and self-contained.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The problem statement is precise, quantitative, and free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent set of information. A reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the dimensionless ratio $R = a_{\\mathrm{on}} / d_{\\min}$. This requires determining the current sheet half-thickness at the onset of the plasmoid instability, $a_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and the minimum relevant kinetic scale, $d_{\\min}$.\n\nThe onset of the plasmoid instability in a Sweet-Parker-like current sheet occurs when the Lundquist number, $S$, exceeds a critical value, $S_c \\approx 10^4$. The problem provides a set of physical parameters that define a specific state of the system. We will calculate the Lundquist number $S$ for this state. If the calculated $S$ is of the order of $10^4$, it is logical to conclude that the given parameters describe the system at the moment of onset. The onset thickness, $a_{\\mathrm{on}}$, is then the Sweet-Parker half-thickness $a_{\\mathrm{SP}}$ corresponding to this value of $S$.\n\nFirst, we assemble the necessary constants:\n- Vacuum permeability: $\\mu_0 = 4\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{T \\cdot m / A}$\n- Proton mass: $m_p \\approx 1.6726 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Electron mass: $m_e \\approx 9.1094 \\times 10^{-31} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Elementary charge: $e \\approx 1.6022 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe ion mass for deuterium is $m_i = 2 m_p \\approx 3.3452 \\times 10^{-27} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in the following steps:\n1.  Calculate the upstream Alfvén speed, $V_A$.\n2.  Calculate the Lundquist number, $S$.\n3.  Calculate the instability onset thickness, $a_{\\mathrm{on}} = L / \\sqrt{S}$.\n4.  Calculate the ion and electron skin depths, $d_i$ and $d_e$, to identify $d_{\\min}$.\n5.  Compute the ratio $R = a_{\\mathrm{on}} / d_{\\min}$.\n\n**1. Alfvén Speed Calculation**\nUsing the given definition $V_A = B_0 / \\sqrt{\\mu_0 n_i m_i}$:\n$$ \\mu_0 n_i m_i = (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (5.0 \\times 10^{19}) (2 \\times 1.6726 \\times 10^{-27}) \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3} $$\n$$ \\mu_0 n_i m_i \\approx 2.1018 \\times 10^{-13} \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3} $$\n$$ V_A = \\frac{0.10}{\\sqrt{2.1018 \\times 10^{-13}}} \\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\approx \\frac{0.10}{4.5846 \\times 10^{-7}} \\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 2.181 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\n\n**2. Lundquist Number Calculation**\nUsing the definition $S = \\mu_0 L V_A / \\eta$:\n$$ S = \\frac{(4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (0.20) (2.181 \\times 10^5)}{2.0 \\times 10^{-6}} $$\n$$ S \\approx \\frac{5.482 \\times 10^{-2}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 27410 $$\nThis value is dimensionless and falls squarely in the theoretically and numerically expected range for the critical Lundquist number $S_c \\sim 10^4$. This confirms that the given parameters describe the system at the onset of the plasmoid instability.\n\n**3. Onset Thickness Calculation**\nThe onset thickness $a_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the Sweet-Parker thickness at this Lundquist number:\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{L}{\\sqrt{S}} = \\frac{0.20}{\\sqrt{27410}} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{on}} \\approx \\frac{0.20}{165.56} \\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 1.208 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\n**4. Minimum Kinetic Scale Calculation**\nThe kinetic scales are the species skin depths, $d_s = \\sqrt{m_s / (\\mu_0 n_s e^2)}$. We need to find $d_{\\min} = \\min(d_i, d_e)$.\nFirst, calculate the term $\\mu_0 n_e e^2$, noting that $n_e=n_i$:\n$$ \\mu_0 n_e e^2 = (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) (5.0 \\times 10^{19}) (1.6022 \\times 10^{-19})^2 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m} $$\n$$ \\mu_0 n_e e^2 \\approx 1.613 \\times 10^{-24} \\ \\mathrm{kg/m} $$\nNow we can compute the electron skin depth $d_e$:\n$$ d_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_e}{\\mu_0 n_e e^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9.1094 \\times 10^{-31}}{1.613 \\times 10^{-24}}} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ d_e \\approx \\sqrt{5.647 \\times 10^{-7}} \\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 7.515 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe ion skin depth $d_i$ is:\n$$ d_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{\\mu_0 n_i e^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m_p}{\\mu_0 n_i e^2}} = d_e \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{m_e}} = d_e \\sqrt{\\frac{2 m_p}{m_e}} $$\nSince $m_i \\gg m_e$, it is clear that $d_i \\gg d_e$. Therefore, the minimum kinetic scale is the electron skin depth:\n$$ d_{\\min} = d_e \\approx 7.515 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\n**5. Ratio Calculation**\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{on}}}{d_{\\min}} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{on}}}{d_e} = \\frac{1.208 \\times 10^{-3}}{7.515 \\times 10^{-4}} $$\n$$ R \\approx 1.6074 $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we get $R \\approx 1.61$. The result $R>1$ indicates that the plasmoid instability is triggered when the current sheet thickness is still larger than the electron skin depth, preventing the sheet from thinning uninterruptedly into a kinetic-scale layer.",

            "solution": "The goal is to determine the reconnection electric field $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ as a function of the external drive amplitude $U_{d}$ in a plasmoid-mediated regime. The appropriate starting point is the induction equation and Faraday’s law, together with flux-freezing in the ideal region and mass conservation across the reconnection layer.\n\nIn resistive Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the generalized Ohm’s law can be written as\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\eta' \\mathbf{J},\n$$\nwhere $\\eta'$ is the electrical resistivity (with units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}$) and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the current density.

In the ideal inflow region immediately upstream of the diffusion layer, the out-of-plane electric field is given by\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{rec}} = u_{\\mathrm{in}} B_{u},\n$$\nwhere $u_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the actual inflow speed into the reconnection layer (the speed at which magnetic flux is advected towards the X-line) and $B_{u}$ is the upstream magnetic field magnitude.\n\nThus, once $u_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is determined, $E_{\\mathrm{rec}}$ follows directly from flux freezing. The central question then reduces to how $u_{\\mathrm{in}}$ depends on the external drive $U_{d}$ given the presence of plasmoids.\n\nIn a supply-limited scenario (weak external drive), the boundary condition enforces an upstream inflow $U_{d}$, and the reconnection layer processes whatever flux is supplied. Provided the layer’s processing capacity is not exceeded, the actual inflow equals the supplied inflow, $u_{\\mathrm{in}} = U_{d}$. By contrast, in a throughput-limited scenario (strong external drive), the internal dynamics of the plasmoid-mediated layer limit how much flux can be reconnected per unit time, independent of $S$ for $S \\gg S_{c}$. A well-tested fact in the plasmoid-mediated regime is that the local inflow speed into active X-points saturates at a value proportional to the Alfvén speed,\n$$\nu_{\\ast} = \\epsilon v_{A},\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a dimensionless constant of order $10^{-2}$, reflecting the reconnection throughput established by the fragmented current sheet. This saturation arises because the layer self-organizes so that local segments operate near marginal stability with a local Lundquist number near $S_{c}$, causing the effective inflow to be $u_{\\mathrm{loc}} \\sim v_{A}/\\sqrt{S_{c}}$ up to order-unity geometric factors. These details are encapsulated in the parameter $\\epsilon$.\n\nWhen the external drive attempts to force an inflow $U_{d}$ greater than the layer’s throughput capacity $u_{\\ast}$, the actual inflow cannot exceed $u_{\\ast}$; otherwise, magnetic flux would accumulate upstream, thickening the layer and re-adjusting the configuration until the throughput limit is respected. Conversely, when $U_{d}$ is below $u_{\\ast}$, the internal throughput does not constrain the inflow, and $u_{\\mathrm{in}}$ equals the supplied $U_{d}$. These two regimes are reconciled by the bottleneck principle:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\min\\left(U_{d},\\,u_{\\ast}\\right) = \\min\\left(U_{d},\\,\\epsilon v_{A}\\right).\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for the reconnection electric field from flux-freezing gives\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{rec}}(U_{d},B_{u},v_{A},\\epsilon) = B_{u}\\,\\min\\left(U_{d},\\,\\epsilon v_{A}\\right).\n$$\nThis expression is valid across the entire plasmoid-mediated regime ($S \\gg S_{c}$).
