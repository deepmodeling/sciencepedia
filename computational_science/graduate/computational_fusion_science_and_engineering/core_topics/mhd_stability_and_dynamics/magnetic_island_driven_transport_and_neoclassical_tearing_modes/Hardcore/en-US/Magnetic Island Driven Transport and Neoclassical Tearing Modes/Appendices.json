The provided problem statement describes a classic problem in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) stability theory—the tearing mode instability of a Harris current sheet. All given information, definitions, and boundary conditions are standard and physically consistent. The problem is a well-posed mathematical physics problem with a unique, known solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe starting point is the set of linearized ideal MHD equations for a static equilibrium ($\\boldsymbol{v}_0 = \\boldsymbol{0}$), neglecting plasma inertia (i.e., taking the limit of zero growth rate, $\\gamma \\to 0$, which is appropriate for determining the marginal stability boundary characterized by $\\Delta'$).

The equilibrium field is given as $\\boldsymbol{B}_0(x) = B_{y}(x) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} = B_{0} \\tanh(x/a) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}$.\n\nThe equilibrium current density is found using Ampère's law, $\\boldsymbol{j}_0 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{B}_0$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{j}_0 = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times (B_y(x) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}}) = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\frac{dB_y}{dx} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} = -\\frac{B_0}{\\mu_0 a} \\mathrm{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}\n$$\nThe in-plane magnetic perturbation $\\delta \\boldsymbol{B}$ is expressed in terms of the perturbed flux function $\\psi(x,y) = \\psi(x) \\exp(i k y)$ as $\\delta \\boldsymbol{B} = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} \\times \\nabla \\psi$.\n$$\n\\delta \\boldsymbol{B} = \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} \\times \\left( \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + ik\\psi \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} \\right) \\exp(iky) = \\left( -ik\\psi \\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\frac{d\\psi}{dx} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{y}} \\right) \\exp(iky)\n$$\nThe perturbed current density $\\delta \\boldsymbol{j}$ is similarly found from $\\delta \\boldsymbol{j} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times \\delta \\boldsymbol{B}$:\n$$\n\\delta \\boldsymbol{j} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\nabla \\times (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} \\times \\nabla \\psi) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}} (\\nabla^2 \\psi) = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0} \\left( \\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} - k^2\\psi \\right) \\exp(iky) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{z}}\n$$\nWe now substitute these expressions into the linearized momentum equation.

A known solution to this equation satisfying the boundary conditions is constructed as follows. A particular solution that decays as $x \\to +\\infty$ is $\\psi_R(x) = (ka + \\tanh(x/a)) \\exp(-kx)$. As the ODE is symmetric in $x$, another solution that decays as $x \\to -\\infty$ is $\\psi_L(x) = \\psi_R(-x) = (ka - \\tanh(x/a)) \\exp(kx)$. The global outer solution is constructed piecewise:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = C \\times \\begin{cases} (ka + \\tanh(x/a)) \\exp(-kx)  \\text{for } x > 0 \\\\ (ka - \\tanh(x/a)) \\exp(kx)  \\text{for } x  0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant. This solution is continuous at $x=0$, with $\\psi(0) = Cka$.

It is self-contained, with all necessary conditions and definitions provided. The problem asks for the derivation of the time required for a magnetic island to grow from an initial size to a final size, based on the classical Rutherford model for tearing modes.\n\nThe problem states that the dynamics are governed by resistive Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In the nonlinear phase of a tearing mode, when the island width $W$ exceeds the thickness of the resistive layer, the growth slows from exponential to algebraic. For a classical tearing mode driven by a positive tearing stability index $\\Delta'$, the evolution of the full island width $W(t)$ is described by the Rutherford equation. The prompt instructs us to use the fundamental relations that lead to this growth law. A full first-principles derivation of the Rutherford equation involves a complicated matching procedure between the \"inner\" resistive layer solution and the \"outer\" ideal MHD solution. However, the prompt guides us by stating that \"matching of inner and outer solutions yields a Rutherford-type growth law\" and specifies the relevant physical regime (classical Rutherford, constant $\\Delta'$). This indicates that the starting point of our derivation should be the Rutherford equation itself, which encapsulates the result of this matching.\n\nThe generalized Rutherford equation for the evolution of the island width $W$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dW}{dt} = k_R \\frac{\\eta}{\\mu_0} \\Delta'\n$$\nwhere $k_R$ is a geometric coefficient of order unity, $\\eta$ is the plasma resistivity, $\\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability, and $\\Delta'$ is the tearing stability index. The problem provides two key simplifications:\n1. The tearing stability index $\\Delta'$ is positive and constant.\n2.

The right-hand side is constant, which directly corresponds to the problem's statement of a \"growth law linear in time,\" as integrating this equation will yield $W$ as a linear function of time $t$.\n\nTo find the time required for the island to grow from an initial width $W_0$ to a target width $W_T$, we can separate variables and integrate.
