Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe starting point is the set of linearized ideal MHD equations for a static equilibrium ($\\boldsymbol{v}_0 = \\boldsymbol{0}$), neglecting plasma inertia (i.e., taking the limit of zero growth rate, $\\gamma \\to 0$, which is appropriate for determining the marginal stability boundary characterized by $\\Delta'$).

A known solution to this equation satisfying the boundary conditions is constructed as follows. A particular solution that decays as $x \\to +\\infty$ is $\\psi_R(x) = (ka + \\tanh(x/a)) \\exp(-kx)$. As the ODE is symmetric in $x$, another solution that decays as $x \\to -\\infty$ is $\\psi_L(x) = \\psi_R(-x) = (ka - \\tanh(x/a)) \\exp(kx)$. The global outer solution is constructed piecewise:\n$$\n\\psi(x) = C \\times \\begin{cases} (ka + \\tanh(x/a)) \\exp(-kx)  \\text{for } x  0 \\\\ (ka - \\tanh(x/a)) \\exp(kx)  \\text{for } x  0 \\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant. This solution is continuous at $x=0$, with $\\psi(0) = Cka$. This form also ensures that $\\psi(x)$ is an even function of $x$, as is required for the fundamental tearing mode.\n\nThe tearing-mode stability parameter $\\Delta'$ is defined as the normalized jump in the logarithmic derivative of $\\psi$ across the resonant layer:\n$$\n\\Delta' \\equiv \\frac{\\psi'(+0) - \\psi'(-0)}{\\psi(0)}\n$$\nWe compute the derivatives $\\psi'(x)$ on both sides of $x=0$.\nFor $x0$:\n$$\n\\psi'(x) = C \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{a}\\mathrm{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)\\right) \\exp(-kx) - k(ka + \\tanh(x/a))\\exp(-kx) \\right]\n$$\nTaking the limit as $x \\to 0^+$:\n$$\n\\psi'(+0) = C \\left[ \\frac{1}{a}\\mathrm{sech}^2(0) - k(ka + \\tanh(0)) \\right] = C\\left(\\frac{1}{a} - k^2a\\right)\n$$\nFor $x0$:\n$$\n\\psi'(x) = C \\left[ \\left(-\\frac{1}{a}\\mathrm{sech}^2\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)\\right) \\exp(kx) + k(ka - \\tanh(x/a))\\exp(kx) \\right]\n$$\nTaking the limit as $x \\to 0^-$:\n$$\n\\psi'(-0) = C \\left[ -\\frac{1}{a}\\mathrm{sech}^2(0) + k(ka - \\tanh(0)) \\right] = C\\left(-\\frac{1}{a} + k^2a\\right)\n$$\nNote that $\\psi'(-0) = -\\psi'(+0)$, confirming that $\\psi'(x)$ is an odd function.\nNow we compute $\\Delta'$:\n$$\n\\Delta' = \\frac{C\\left(\\frac{1}{a} - k^2a\\right) - C\\left(-\\frac{1}{a} + k^2a\\right)}{Cka} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{a} - 2k^2a}{ka}\n$$\nFactoring the numerator and simplifying, we obtain the final expression for $\\Delta'$:\n$$\n\\Delta' = \\frac{2\\left(\\frac{1 - k^2a^2}{a}\\right)}{ka} = \\frac{2(1 - (ka)^2)}{ka^2}\n$$\nThis expression gives the stability parameter as a function of the normalized wavenumber $ka$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the critical island half-width, denoted as $W_c$, at which the electron temperature profile $T_e$ significantly flattens within a magnetic island. This physical condition arises from the competition between two diffusive heat transport processes: transport parallel to the magnetic field lines, which tends to equilibrate temperature along a given flux surface, and transport perpendicular to the magnetic field lines, which tends to re-establish a temperature gradient across different flux surfaces. The onset of flattening is defined to occur when the characteristic timescales for these two processes are equal.\n\nThe characteristic time $\\tau$ for a diffusive process with a thermal diffusivity $D$ over a characteristic length scale $L$ is given by the scaling law:\n$$\n\\tau \\sim \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\n\nFirst, we define the timescale for perpendicular heat transport, $\\tau_{\\perp}$.

The safety factor, $q$, is defined as the number of toroidal transits a field line completes for every single poloidal transit. In a large-aspect-ratio tokamak with major radius $R$, the length of one full toroidal circuit is approximately $2\\pi R$. At the resonant surface where the safety factor is $q_r$, a field line makes $q_r$ toroidal turns for one poloidal turn.

We assume $\\omega_i(t)$ varies slowly, so for the fast loop dynamics, $d\\omega_{i}/dt \\approx 0$.\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi(t)}{dt^2} = -K K_{p}\\,\\frac{d\\phi(t)}{dt} - K K_{i}\\,\\phi(t) $$\nRearranging gives the homogeneous second-order linear ODE for the phase error dynamics:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi(t)}{dt^2} + K K_{p}\\,\\frac{d\\phi(t)}{dt} + K K_{i}\\,\\phi(t) = 0 $$\nThe characteristic polynomial in the Laplace variable $s$ is obtained by replacing $d/dt$ with $s$:\n$$ s^2 + (K K_{p})\\,s + (K K_{i}) = 0 $$\nThis is compared to the canonical second-order characteristic polynomial, $s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s + \\omega_{n}^2 = 0$. By equating coefficients, we find the relationships:\n$$ \\omega_{n}^2 = K K_{i} $$\n$$ 2\\zeta\\omega_{n} = K K_{p} $$\nFrom these, we can express the controller gains $K_{p}$ and $K_{i}$ in terms of the canonical parameters and the loop gain $K = K_{v}K_{d}$:\n$$ K_{i} = \\frac{\\omega_{n}^2}{K} = \\frac{\\omega_{n}^2}{K_{v}K_{d}} $$\n$$ K_{p} = \\frac{2\\zeta\\omega_{n}}{K} = \\frac{2\\zeta\\omega_{n}}{K_{v}K_{d}} $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Controller Gains**\n\nGiven the parameters:\n- $K_{d} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{V\\,rad^{-1}}$\n- $K_{v} = 5.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}\\,V^{-1}}$\n- $\\omega_{n} = 1.20 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $\\zeta = 0.707$\n\nThe total loop gain is $K = K_{v}K_{d} = (5.0 \\times 10^{3})\\,(2.0) = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\nWe calculate the required integral and proportional gains:\n$$ K_{i} = \\frac{(1.20 \\times 10^{3})^{2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{4}} = \\frac{1.44 \\times 10^{6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{4}} = 144\\,\\mathrm{V^{-1}} $$\n$$ K_{p} = \\frac{2(0.707)(1.20 \\times 10^{3})}{1.0 \\times 10^{4}} = \\frac{1696.8}{1.0 \\times 10^{4}} \\approx 0.1697\\,\\mathrm{V^{-1}s} $$\nThese gains achieve the target performance for the idealized delay-free system.\n\n**Part 3: Stability Analysis with Delay**\n\nThe open-loop transfer function $L(s)$ of the system, including the delay $\\tau$, is the product of the controller, plant (integrator), phase detector gain, and delay transfer functions:\n$$ L(s) = K_{d} \\left( K_{p} + \\frac{K_{i}}{s} \\right) \\frac{K_{v}}{s} e^{-s\\tau} = \\frac{K(K_{p}s + K_{i})}{s^2} e^{-s\\tau} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $K_p$ and $K_i$:\n$$ L(s) = \\frac{K((2\\zeta\\omega_{n}/K)s + (\\omega_{n}^2/K))}{s^2} e^{-s\\tau} = \\frac{2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s + \\omega_{n}^2}{s^2} e^{-s\\tau} $$\nThe total delay is $\\tau = 1.50 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The delay introduces a phase lag of $\\Delta\\phi(\\omega) = -\\omega\\tau$ in the frequency domain. For stability robustness, we examine the phase margin. The damping ratio $\\zeta = 0.707 \\approx 1/\\sqrt{2}$ is known to provide good phase margin. For the delay-free system ($L_0(s) = L(s)|_{\\tau=0}$), the phase margin is approximately $PM \\approx 100 \\zeta \\approx 70.7^{\\circ}$. More precisely, the gain crossover frequency $\\omega_{gc}$ (where $|L_0(j\\omega_{gc})|=1$) is $\\omega_{gc} \\approx 1.55\\omega_n$. At this frequency, the added phase lag due to the delay is:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{lag} = \\omega_{gc}\\tau \\approx 1.55 \\omega_{n} \\tau = 1.55 \\times (1.20 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (1.50 \\times 10^{-4}) = 0.279\\,\\mathrm{rad} $$\nIn degrees, this is $\\Delta\\phi_{lag} \\approx 0.279 \\times (180/\\pi) \\approx 16.0^{\\circ}$. The phase margin is reduced by this amount. The delay-free phase margin for $\\zeta=0.707$ is approximately $65.5^{\\circ}$. The new phase margin is $PM \\approx 65.5^{\\circ} - 16.0^{\\circ} = 49.5^{\\circ}$. This is a substantial and healthy phase margin, indicating that the system remains robustly stable despite the delay. The choice of $\\omega_n$ and $\\zeta$ is robust because $\\zeta=0.707$ provides a large intrinsic phase margin, and the delay is small enough ($\\omega_{n}\\tau = 0.18 \\ll 1$) that it does not destabilize the loop.\n\nUsing the Padé approximation $e^{-s\\tau} \\approx \\frac{1 - s\\tau/2}{1 + s\\tau/2}$, the characteristic equation $1+L(s)=0$ becomes:\n$$ s^2 + (2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s + \\omega_{n}^2)\\frac{1 - s\\tau/2}{1 + s\\tau/2} = 0 $$\n$$ (\\frac{\\tau}{2})s^3 + (1 - \\zeta\\omega_{n}\\tau)s^2 + (2\\zeta\\omega_{n} - \\frac{\\omega_{n}^2\\tau}{2})s + \\omega_{n}^2 = 0 $$\nWith the given values, all coefficients of this third-order polynomial are positive, and the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion $a_2 a_1  a_3 a_0$ is satisfied, confirming stability.\n\n**Part 4: Calculation of Settling Time**\n\nWe need to find the response of the phase error $\\phi(t)$ to a step-like change in island frequency, $\\Delta\\omega_i$. We analyze the error dynamics using Laplace transforms on the delay-free model, as the delay is small and its impact on the dominant poles is minimal. The governing equation in the Laplace domain is:\n$$ \\Phi(s) [s + K(K_p + K_i/s)] = \\Omega_i(s) $$\n$$ \\Phi(s) \\left[ \\frac{s^2 + K K_p s + K K_i}{s} \\right] = \\Omega_i(s) $$\nThe transfer function from a frequency change $\\Omega_i(s)$ to the phase error $\\Phi(s)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\Phi(s)}{\\Omega_i(s)} = \\frac{s}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s + \\omega_{n}^2} $$\nA step change in frequency of magnitude $\\Delta\\omega_i$ is represented by $\\Omega_i(s) = \\Delta\\omega_i/s$. The phase error response is:\n$$ \\Phi(s) = \\left( \\frac{s}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s + \\omega_{n}^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\Delta\\omega_i}{s} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega_i}{s^2 + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n}s + \\omega_{n}^2} $$\nThis is the standard Laplace transform of an impulse response for a second-order system. The time-domain response is $\\phi(t) = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega_i}{\\omega_d} e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t} \\sin(\\omega_{d}t)$, where $\\omega_d = \\omega_n\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$. The response decays to zero with an exponential envelope $e^{-\\zeta\\omega_{n}t}$.\n\nThe problem asks to use the standard $2\\%$ settling time approximation for a second-order system, which is the time for the exponential envelope to decay to $2\\%$ of its initial value:\n$$ t_s \\approx \\frac{4}{\\zeta\\omega_{n}} $$\nUsing the given values:\n- $\\zeta = 0.707$\n- $\\omega_{n} = 1.20 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{rad\\,s^{-1}}$\nThe product is $\\zeta\\omega_{n} = 0.707 \\times 1.20 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 848.4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n$$ t_s \\approx \\frac{4}{848.4\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 0.004714757\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer in milliseconds, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ t_s \\approx 4.714757\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $t_s = 4.715\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.",
