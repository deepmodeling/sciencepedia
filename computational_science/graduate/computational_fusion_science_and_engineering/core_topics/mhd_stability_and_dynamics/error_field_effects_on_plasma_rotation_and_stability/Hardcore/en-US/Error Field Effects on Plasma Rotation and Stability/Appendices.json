Before analyzing the complex dynamics of plasma braking and instability, it is essential to first understand how to identify these critical locations.

            "problem": "Consider a large-aspect-ratio toroidal plasma approximated by a straight cylindrical equilibrium of minor radius $a$, in which the safety factor profile is linear, $q(r)=q_0+q_1 r$, with $q_0$ and $q_1$ positive constants. A static magnetic error field can be decomposed into Fourier harmonics with poloidal mode number $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and toroidal mode number $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ (the \"spectrum\" of $n$ indicates that several distinct $n$ values may be present). In an ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) description, a helical perturbation labeled by $(m,n)$ resonates at radii $r=r_s$ where parallel phase stationarity along equilibrium magnetic field lines is satisfied.\n\nStarting from first principles, use the field-line phase condition for resonance and the definition of the safety factor $q(r)$ based on the ratio of toroidal to poloidal field-line advances to derive the closed-form expression for the set of resonant radii $r_s$ for a given $n$ and all integers $m$ that satisfy $0 \\le r_s \\le a$. Then, for a fixed $n$, estimate the radial separation $\\Delta r$ between adjacent resonant surfaces corresponding to consecutive poloidal mode numbers $m$ and $m+1$.\n\nYour derivation must begin from fundamental definitions of $q(r)$ and the resonance condition in terms of field-line phase advance, without invoking any pre-derived shortcuts. Express your final results as analytic expressions in terms of $q_0$, $q_1$, $m$, $n$, and (where needed to define the allowable set) $a$. Use meters for radii and separations. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed. The final answer must be a single closed-form expression or a single row matrix of expressions.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive the locations of resonant magnetic surfaces, $r_s$, and their radial separation, $\\Delta r$, within a cylindrical plasma model. The derivation must originate from first principles as specified: the definition of the safety factor, $q(r)$, and the condition for phase stationarity of a helical perturbation.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental concepts in a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$, where $r$ is the minor radius, $\\theta$ is the poloidal angle, and $z$ corresponds to the toroidal direction. The toroidal angle is $\\phi = z/R_0$, where $R_0$ is the major radius of the torus, which is taken to be large. The equilibrium magnetic field in a straight cylinder approximation has no radial component, $\\vec{B} = B_\\theta(r) \\hat{e}_\\theta + B_z(r) \\hat{e}_z$.\n\nThe safety factor, $q(r)$, characterizes the pitch of the magnetic field lines. It is defined as the rate of change of toroidal angle $\\phi$ with respect to poloidal angle $\\theta$ as one follows a field line. The trajectory of a field line is given by the equation $\\frac{r d\\theta}{B_\\theta} = \\frac{dz}{B_z}$. Using $\\phi = z/R_0$, we have $dz = R_0 d\\phi$. Substituting this into the field line equation gives $\\frac{r d\\theta}{B_\\theta} = \\frac{R_0 d\\phi}{B_z}$. Rearranging for the rate of change yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} = \\frac{r B_z}{R_0 B_\\theta}\n$$\nBy definition, this ratio is the safety factor $q(r)$:\n$$\nq(r) = \\frac{r B_z(r)}{R_0 B_\\theta(r)}\n$$\nThis definition quantifies the field line advance: for every full poloidal transit ($\\Delta\\theta=2\\pi$), the toroidal advance is $\\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi q(r)$.\n\nNext, we formalize the resonance condition. A static magnetic error field perturbation can be described as a sum of Fourier harmonics. A single harmonic with poloidal mode number $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ and toroidal mode number $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$ has a helical structure. Its phase, $\\alpha$, is constant on helical paths defined by $m\\theta - n\\phi = \\text{constant}$. In the cylindrical system, this phase is $\\alpha(r, \\theta, z) = m\\theta - n(z/R_0)$.\n\nResonance occurs at radii $r_s$ where the helical perturbation has a constant phase along the equilibrium magnetic field lines. This condition of \"parallel phase stationarity\" is expressed mathematically as the directional derivative of the phase along the magnetic field being zero:\n$$\n\\vec{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\alpha = 0\n$$\nThe gradient of the phase $\\alpha$ in cylindrical coordinates is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\alpha = \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial r} \\hat{e}_r + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial \\theta} \\hat{e}_\\theta + \\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial z} \\hat{e}_z = 0 \\cdot \\hat{e}_r + \\frac{m}{r} \\hat{e}_\\theta - \\frac{n}{R_0} \\hat{e}_z\n$$\nNow, we take the dot product with the equilibrium magnetic field $\\vec{B} = B_\\theta \\hat{e}_\\theta + B_z \\hat{e}_z$:\n$$\n\\vec{B} \\cdot \\nabla \\alpha = (B_\\theta \\hat{e}_\\theta + B_z \\hat{e}_z) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{m}{r} \\hat{e}_\\theta - \\frac{n}{R_0} \\hat{e}_z\\right) = \\frac{m B_\\theta}{r} - \\frac{n B_z}{R_0}\n$$\nSetting this to zero for resonance at a radius $r=r_s$:\n$$\n\\frac{m B_\\theta(r_s)}{r_s} - \\frac{n B_z(r_s)}{R_0} = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{r_s B_z(r_s)}{R_0 B_\\theta(r_s)}\n$$\nComparing this with the definition of the safety factor, we arrive at the fundamental resonance condition:\n$$\nq(r_s) = \\frac{m}{n}\n$$\n\nNow we can use this condition to find the resonant radii $r_s$. The problem specifies a linear safety factor profile:\n$$\nq(r) = q_0 + q_1 r\n$$\nwhere $q_0$ and $q_1$ are positive constants. Substituting this into the resonance condition:\n$$\nq_0 + q_1 r_s = \\frac{m}{n}\n$$\nWe solve for $r_s$:\n$$\nq_1 r_s = \\frac{m}{n} - q_0 = \\frac{m - nq_0}{n}\n$$\n$$\nr_s = \\frac{m - nq_0}{n q_1}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the resonant radius for a given pair of mode numbers $(m,n)$. These resonant surfaces are physically located within the plasma, which has a minor radius $a$. Therefore, we must enforce the condition $0 \\le r_s \\le a$.\n\nThe condition $r_s \\ge 0$ implies $\\frac{m - nq_0}{nq_1} \\ge 0$. Since $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, $q_1  0$, the denominator $nq_1$ is positive. Thus, we require $m - nq_0 \\ge 0$, or $m \\ge nq_0$.\nThe condition $r_s \\le a$ implies $\\frac{m - nq_0}{nq_1} \\le a$. This leads to $m - nq_0 \\le anq_1$, or $m \\le nq_0 + anq_1$.\nCombining these, for a given $n$, the poloidal mode numbers $m$ that correspond to resonant surfaces inside the plasma are integers satisfying $nq_0 \\le m \\le n(q_0 + q_1 a)$.\n\nThe second task is to estimate the radial separation, $\\Delta r$, between adjacent resonant surfaces. These correspond to a fixed toroidal mode number $n$ and consecutive poloidal mode numbers, $m$ and $m+1$. Let $r_s(m)$ denote the resonant radius for mode number $m$.\n$$\nr_s(m) = \\frac{m - nq_0}{n q_1}\n$$\nThe radius for the next mode, $m+1$, is:\n$$\nr_s(m+1) = \\frac{(m+1) - nq_0}{n q_1}\n$$\nThe separation $\\Delta r$ is the difference between these two radii:\n$$\n\\Delta r = r_s(m+1) - r_s(m) = \\frac{(m+1) - nq_0}{n q_1} - \\frac{m - nq_0}{n q_1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta r = \\frac{(m+1 - nq_0) - (m - nq_0)}{n q_1} = \\frac{1}{n q_1}\n$$\nThis result is an exact separation, not an estimate, due to the assumption of a linear $q(r)$ profile. For a general profile $q(r)$, the separation can be approximated as $\\Delta r \\approx \\frac{\\Delta m}{n |q'(r_s)|}$. With $\\Delta m = 1$ and $q'(r) = q_1$ (a constant), our exact result is recovered. This constant separation indicates that for a linear $q$ profile, the resonant surfaces are equally spaced.\n\nThe two required results are the expression for the resonant radii, $r_s$, and their separation, $\\Delta r$.",

The core of the problem lies in evaluating the slowdown time $t_s$ from the provided integral expression.\n\nThe governing equation for the plasma's angular frequency $\\Omega$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\Omega}{dt} = -\\frac{\\Gamma}{I} \\Omega - \\frac{\\alpha b^2}{I} \\frac{1}{1 + (\\Omega/\\Omega_c)^2} $$\nLet us define the normalized drag coefficient $\\nu = \\Gamma/I$ and the normalized torque amplitude $\\tau = \\alpha b^2 / I$.

Calculate the derived parameters $\\nu = \\Gamma/I$ and $\\tau = \\alpha b^2/I$.\n3.  Define the integrand function:\n    $$ g(\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{\\nu \\Omega + \\frac{\\tau}{1 + (\\Omega/\\Omega_c)^2}} $$\n4.  Set the integration limits: the lower limit is $\\Omega_f = \\Omega_0/2$ and the upper limit is $\\Omega_0$.\n5.  Compute the integral $t_s = \\int_{\\Omega_0/2}^{\\Omega_0} g(\\Omega) d\\Omega$ using a numerical integration routine.\n6.  Retrieve the observed slowdown time $t_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ for the case.\n7.  Calculate the absolute fractional deviation $\\delta = |(t_s - t_{\\mathrm{obs}}) / t_{\\mathrm{obs}}|$.\n8.  Determine if the model fidelity is acceptable by checking if $\\delta \\le 0.25$.\n9.  Store the calculated $t_s$ (rounded to three decimal places) and the boolean fidelity result.\n\nThis process is repeated for all four test cases.\n\n**Case 1: General case**\n- $\\Omega_0 = 2000$, $b = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$, $\\Gamma = 1.0 \\times 10^5$, $t_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 5.0$\n- $\\nu = 10^5 / 10^6 = 0.1 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- $\\tau = 10^{16} (10^{-4})^2 / 10^6 = 100 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}}$\n- Integrate from $\\Omega_f = 1000$ to $\\Omega_0 = 2000$.\n\n**Case 2: Viscous-dominated limit**\n- $\\Omega_0 = 2000$, $b = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}$, $\\Gamma = 1.0 \\times 10^5$, $t_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 6.95$\n- $\\nu = 0.1 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- $\\tau = 10^{16} (10^{-7})^2 / 10^6 = 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}}$ (a very small value)\n- Integrate from $\\Omega_f = 1000$ to $\\Omega_0 = 2000$.

This often involves applying multiple magnetic fields simultaneously to cancel out intrinsic errors. This exercise () explores the physics of multi-harmonic interference, demonstrating how the total electromagnetic torque depends critically on the relative phasing of the applied fields. By working through the principles of linear superposition, you will see how fields can be phased for destructive interference, providing a powerful method to minimize or nullify the net braking torque on the plasma.",

Consider a target rational safety-factor surface at radius $r_{s}$, where $q(r_{s})=m/n$ for a chosen pair $(m,n)$, and assume thin-layer coupling such that the dominant contribution to the electromagnetic torque arises from the resonant component of the radial magnetic field at $r_{s}$. The total applied error field is the superposition of two non-axisymmetric harmonics with the same toroidal mode number $n$ but distinct poloidal characteristics that both couple to the target surface through the plasma’s linear response.\n\nLet the complex plasma transfer function from the applied vacuum error field to the resonant radial magnetic field at $r_{s}$ for the $k$-th harmonic be $H_{k}=\\left|H_{k}\\right|\\exp\\!\\left(i\\theta_{k}\\right)$, where $\\left|H_{k}\\right|0$ is the gain and $\\theta_{k}$ is the phase shift imparted by the plasma. The applied vacuum field magnitudes at the plasma edge for the two harmonics are $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$, and their toroidal launch phases (relative to a common reference) are $\\varphi_{1}$ and $\\varphi_{2}$, respectively.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe problem asks for an expression for the normalized electromagnetic error-field torque, $T_{EF}$, starting from its definition in terms of the resonant radial magnetic field, $b_{r,\\mathrm{res}}$. The prompt's reference to the Lorentz force and Maxwell stress tensor provides physical context for the origin of the electromagnetic torque. However, the calculation itself begins with the provided expressions for $b_{r,\\mathrm{res}}$ and $T_{EF}$.\n\nThe normalized resonant radial field, $b_{r,\\mathrm{res}}$, is given as the linear superposition of the contributions from two applied harmonics:\n$$b_{r,\\mathrm{res}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{2}\\left|H_{k}\\right|\\frac{B_{k}}{B_{0}}\\exp\\!\\left[i\\left(\\theta_{k}+\\varphi_{k}\\right)\\right]$$\nLet us define two complex amplitudes, $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, which represent the resonant field components generated by each harmonic, including the plasma's response but excluding the applied toroidal phase:\n$$C_{1} = \\left|H_{1}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}}{B_{0}}\\exp(i\\theta_{1})$$\n$$C_{2} = \\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{2}}{B_{0}}\\exp(i\\theta_{2})$$\nWith these definitions, and using the given phases $\\varphi_1=0$ and $\\varphi_2 = \\varphi$, the total resonant field can be written as:\n$$b_{r,\\mathrm{res}} = C_{1}\\exp(i\\varphi_{1}) + C_{2}\\exp(i\\varphi_{2}) = C_{1} + C_{2}\\exp(i\\varphi)$$\nThe torque is defined as the squared magnitude of this complex quantity:\n$$T_{EF}(\\varphi) = \\left|b_{r,\\mathrm{res}}\\right|^{2} = \\left|C_{1} + C_{2}\\exp(i\\varphi)\\right|^{2}$$\nUsing the property that $\\left|z\\right|^{2} = z z^{*}$ for any complex number $z$, we expand the expression:\n$$T_{EF}(\\varphi) = \\left(C_{1} + C_{2}\\exp(i\\varphi)\\right)\\left(C_{1}^{*} + C_{2}^{*}\\exp(-i\\varphi)\\right)$$\n$$T_{EF}(\\varphi) = C_{1}C_{1}^{*} + C_{1}C_{2}^{*}\\exp(-i\\varphi) + C_{2}C_{1}^{*}\\exp(i\\varphi) + C_{2}C_{2}^{*}\\exp(i\\varphi)\\exp(-i\\varphi)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$T_{EF}(\\varphi) = \\left|C_{1}\\right|^{2} + \\left|C_{2}\\right|^{2} + C_{1}C_{2}^{*}\\exp(-i\\varphi) + C_{1}^{*}C_{2}\\exp(i\\varphi)$$\nThe last two terms are a complex number and its conjugate. Their sum is twice the real part: $z+z^{*} = 2\\mathrm{Re}(z)$. Let $z = C_{1}^{*}C_{2}\\exp(i\\varphi)$. Then:\n$$T_{EF}(\\varphi) = \\left|C_{1}\\right|^{2} + \\left|C_{2}\\right|^{2} + 2\\mathrm{Re}\\left(C_{1}^{*}C_{2}\\exp(i\\varphi)\\right)$$\nLet's evaluate the term $C_{1}^{*}C_{2}$:\n$$C_{1}^{*}C_{2} = \\left(\\left|H_{1}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}}{B_{0}}\\exp(-i\\theta_{1})\\right)\\left(\\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{2}}{B_{0}}\\exp(i\\theta_{2})\\right) = \\left|H_{1}\\right|\\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}B_{2}}{B_{0}^{2}}\\exp(i(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1}))$$\nSubstituting this back into the torque expression:\n$$T_{EF}(\\varphi) = \\left|C_{1}\\right|^{2} + \\left|C_{2}\\right|^{2} + 2\\mathrm{Re}\\left(\\left|H_{1}\\right|\\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}B_{2}}{B_{0}^{2}}\\exp(i(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1}))\\exp(i\\varphi)\\right)$$\n$$T_{EF}(\\varphi) = \\left(\\left|H_{1}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}}{B_{0}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{2}}{B_{0}}\\right)^{2} + 2\\mathrm{Re}\\left(\\left|H_{1}\\right|\\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}B_{2}}{B_{0}^{2}}\\exp(i(\\varphi + \\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1}))\\right)$$\nThe real part of $\\exp(i\\alpha)$ is $\\cos(\\alpha)$. Thus, we arrive at the final symbolic form:\n$$T_{EF}(\\varphi) = \\left(\\left|H_{1}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}}{B_{0}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{2}}{B_{0}}\\right)^{2} + 2\\left|H_{1}\\right|\\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}B_{2}}{B_{0}^{2}}\\cos(\\varphi + \\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1})$$\nThis expression matches the desired form $T_{EF}(\\varphi) = A+B\\cos(\\varphi+\\Delta)$, where:\n$$A = \\left(\\left|H_{1}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}}{B_{0}}\\right)^{2} + \\left(\\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{2}}{B_{0}}\\right)^{2}$$\n$$B = 2\\left|H_{1}\\right|\\left|H_{2}\\right|\\frac{B_{1}B_{2}}{B_{0}^{2}}$$\n$$\\Delta = \\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\left|H_{1}\\right|=1.8$, $\\theta_{1}=0.25$ rad.\n$\\left|H_{2}\\right|=0.9$, $\\theta_{2}=-0.60$ rad.\n$B_{1}=3.0\\times 10^{-4}$, $B_{2}=2.0\\times 10^{-4}$, $B_{0}=2.5$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the normalized applied field magnitudes:\n$$\\frac{B_{1}}{B_{0}} = \\frac{3.0\\times 10^{-4}}{2.5} = 1.2\\times 10^{-4}$$\n$$\\frac{B_{2}}{B_{0}} = \\frac{2.0\\times 10^{-4}}{2.5} = 0.8\\times 10^{-4}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the constants $A$, $B$, and $\\Delta$:\n$$A = \\left(1.8 \\times 1.2\\times 10^{-4}\\right)^{2} + \\left(0.9 \\times 0.8\\times 10^{-4}\\right)^{2}$$\n$$A = \\left(2.16\\times 10^{-4}\\right)^{2} + \\left(0.72\\times 10^{-4}\\right)^{2}$$\n$$A = 4.6656\\times 10^{-8} + 0.5184\\times 10^{-8} = 5.184\\times 10^{-8}$$\n\n$$B = 2\\left(1.8\\right)\\left(0.9\\right)\\frac{(3.0\\times 10^{-4})(2.0\\times 10^{-4})}{(2.5)^{2}} = 2\\left(1.8 \\times 1.2\\times 10^{-4}\\right)\\left(0.9 \\times 0.8\\times 10^{-4}\\right)$$\n$$B = 2\\left(2.16\\times 10^{-4}\\right)\\left(0.72\\times 10^{-4}\\right)$$\n$$B = 2\\left(1.5552\\times 10^{-9}\\right) = 3.1104\\times 10^{-8}$$\n\n$$\\Delta = -0.60 - 0.25 = -0.85 \\text{ radians}$$\n\nThis yields the final analytical expression for the torque as a function of the relative phasing $\\varphi$:\n$$T_{EF}(\\varphi) = 5.184\\times 10^{-8} + 3.1104\\times 10^{-8}\\cos(\\varphi - 0.85)$$\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result relates to wave interference. The total torque is not simply the sum of the torques that would be produced by each harmonic individually. The term $A$ represents this sum: $A = \\left|C_{1}\\right|^{2} + \\left|C_{2}\\right|^{2} = T_{EF,1} + T_{EF,2}$. The term $B\\cos(\\varphi+\\Delta)$ is an interference term that arises from the cross-product of the two resonant field components.\n- **Constructive Interference**: The torque is maximized when $\\cos(\\varphi+\\Delta) = 1$. This occurs when the argument of the cosine is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, i.e., $\\varphi+\\Delta=2k\\pi$ for integer $k$. For $k=0$, this means $\\varphi = -\\Delta = -(\\theta_{2}-\\theta_{1}) = \\theta_{1}-\\theta_{2}$. At this relative phasing, the applied phase difference $\\varphi$ exactly compensates for the difference in phase shifts $\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{2}$ imparted by the plasma response. The two resonant field components, $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}\\exp(i\\varphi)$, become aligned in phase, and their magnitudes add, leading to maximal torque $T_{EF,max} = A+B$.\n- **Destructive Interference**: The torque is minimized when $\\cos(\\varphi+\\Delta) = -1$. This occurs when $\\varphi+\\Delta=(2k+1)\\pi$. For $k=0$, this means $\\varphi = \\pi-\\Delta = \\pi+\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{2}$. At this phasing, the two resonant field components are perfectly anti-aligned (out of phase by $\\pi$ radians), and their magnitudes subtract, leading to minimal torque $T_{EF,min} = A-B$. In the context of tokamak operations, this destructive interference is highly desirable for error field correction, as it allows for the minimization of braking torques that can lead to plasma rotation stall and disruptive instabilities.",
