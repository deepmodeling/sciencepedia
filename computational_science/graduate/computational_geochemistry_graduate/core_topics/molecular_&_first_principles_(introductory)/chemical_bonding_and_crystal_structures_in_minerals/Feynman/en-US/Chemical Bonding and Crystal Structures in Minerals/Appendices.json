As with option C, $\\nabla^{2}\\rho_{\\mathrm{BCP}} > 0$ is not sufficient to distinguish H-bonds from vdW interactions. Contact $3$ is an $\\mathrm{O}\\cdots \\mathrm{O}$ contact, not an H-bond. The geometric argument for Contact $1$ is false; its distance of $1.80\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ is exemplary for an H-bond.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous application of QTAIM principles, only option A provides a correct and consistent classification of all four interactions.",

The total new surface area created is $2A$. The surface free energy, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}}$, is the energy cost per unit of new surface area. Therefore, the total energy can also be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta E = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}} (2A) $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\Delta E$ gives:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}} (2A) = N_{\\mathrm{broken}} E_{\\mathrm{SiO}} $$\nSolving for $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}}$, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{broken}} E_{\\mathrm{SiO}}}{2A} $$\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}}$ for each of the three faces. First, we convert the bond energy $E_{\\mathrm{SiO}}$ from electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$) to Joules ($\\mathrm{J}$):\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{SiO}} = 4.7\\ \\mathrm{eV} \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J}/\\mathrm{eV}) = 7.5294 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J} $$\nNow, we calculate $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}}$ for each face:\nFor the $\\{10\\overline{1}0\\}$ face:\n$N_{\\mathrm{broken}} = 6$, $A = 1.20 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}, \\{10\\overline{1}0\\}} = \\frac{6 \\times (7.5294 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J})}{2 \\times (1.20 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2})} = \\frac{4.51764 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{J}}{2.40 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}} \\approx 1.8824\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\nFor the $\\{11\\overline{2}0\\}$ face:\n$N_{\\mathrm{broken}} = 7$, $A = 1.05 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}, \\{11\\overline{2}0\\}} = \\frac{7 \\times (7.5294 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J})}{2 \\times (1.05 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2})} = \\frac{5.27058 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{J}}{2.10 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}} \\approx 2.5098\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\nFor the $\\{0001\\}$ face:\n$N_{\\mathrm{broken}} = 10$, $A = 1.60 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{bb}, \\{0001\\}} = \\frac{10 \\times (7.5294 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{J})}{2 \\times (1.60 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2})} = \\frac{7.5294 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{J}}{3.20 \\times 10^{-18}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}} \\approx 2.3529\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\nThe second task is to compute the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, $\\rho$, between the broken-bond model predictions and the density functional theory (DFT) results. The two sets of surface energies, ordered by face $\\{10\\overline{1}0\\}$, $\\{11\\overline{2}0\\}$, $\\{0001\\}$, are:\n$$ \\vec{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{bb}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.8824 & 2.5098 & 2.3529 \\end{pmatrix} \\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\n$$ \\vec{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{DFT}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.10 & 1.35 & 1.70 \\end{pmatrix} \\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{-2} $$\nTo find the Spearman coefficient, we first rank the values within each vector. A rank of $1$ is assigned to the smallest value, $2$ to the second smallest, and so on.\nFor $\\vec{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{bb}}$:\nThe smallest value is $1.8824$ (face $\\{10\\overline{1}0\\}$), so its rank is $1$.\nThe next smallest is $2.3529$ (face $\\{0001\\}$), so its rank is $2$.\nThe largest is $2.5098$ (face $\\{11\\overline{2}0\\}$), so its rank is $3$.\nThe rank vector for $\\vec{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{bb}}$ is $R_{\\mathrm{bb}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 3 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor $\\vec{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{DFT}}$:\nThe values are already in increasing order: $1.10 < 1.35 < 1.70$.\nThe rank vector for $\\vec{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{DFT}}$ is $R_{\\mathrm{DFT}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe Spearman rank correlation coefficient $\\rho$ is calculated using the formula:\n$$ \\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)} $$\nwhere $d_i$ is the difference between the ranks for each pair of data points, and $n$ is the number of data pairs. Here, $n=3$.\nThe differences in ranks, $d_i$, are:\n$$ d_1 = R_{\\mathrm{bb},1} - R_{\\mathrm{DFT},1} = 1 - 1 = 0 $$\n$$ d_2 = R_{\\mathrm{bb},2} - R_{\\mathrm{DFT},2} = 3 - 2 = 1 $$\n$$ d_3 = R_{\\mathrm{bb},3} - R_{\\mathrm{DFT},3} = 2 - 3 = -1 $$\nThe sum of the squared differences is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} d_i^2 = 0^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 $$\nNow we can compute $\\rho$:\n$$ \\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\times 2}{3(3^2 - 1)} = 1 - \\frac{12}{3(9 - 1)} = 1 - \\frac{12}{3(8)} = 1 - \\frac{12}{24} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 $$\nThe problem asks for the result rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $0.5$.",
