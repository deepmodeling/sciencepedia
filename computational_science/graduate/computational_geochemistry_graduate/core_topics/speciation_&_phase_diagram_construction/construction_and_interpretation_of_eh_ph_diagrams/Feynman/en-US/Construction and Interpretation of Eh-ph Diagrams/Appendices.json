The problem is a standard exercise in constructing Pourbaix diagrams and is free of contradictions or fallacies.\n\nThe derivation of the oxidation-reduction potential ($Eh$) for the given half-reaction begins from the fundamental condition of thermodynamic equilibrium. For any chemical reaction, equilibrium is established when the Gibbs free energy of reaction, $\\Delta_r G$, is zero. For an electrochemical half-reaction, this is expressed as the sum of the chemical potentials, $\\mu_i$, of the participating species, each weighted by its stoichiometric coefficient $\\nu_i$, being equal to zero.\n\nThe half-reaction is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} + e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\n$$\nRewriting this in the form $\\sum_i \\nu_i A_i = 0$, where $A_i$ represents the species, we have:\n$$\n(1)\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} + (-1)\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} + (-1)e^{-} = 0\n$$\nThe condition for equilibrium is therefore:\n$$\n\\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i = (1)\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} - (1)\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}} - (1)\\mu_{e^{-}} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}$, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}$, and $\\mu_{e^{-}}$ are the chemical potentials of the ferrous ion, ferric ion, and electron, respectively.\n\nThe chemical potential $\\mu_i$ of a species $i$ in solution is related to its activity $a_i$ and standard chemical potential $\\mu_i^{\\circ}$ by the equation:\n$$\n\\mu_i = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + RT \\ln(a_i)\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature in kelvins.\n\nSubstituting this relationship into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\n(\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}) - (\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}) - \\mu_{e^{-}} = 0\n$$\nThe chemical potential of the electron, $\\mu_{e^{-}}$, in an electrochemical system is related to the redox potential $Eh$ (relative to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode) and the Faraday constant, $F$, by the relation:\n$$\n\\mu_{e^{-}} = -FEh\n$$\nThe number of electrons, $n$, is $1$ for this reaction, so the relation is precise.

For this half-reaction, $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{e^{-}}^{\\circ}$. However, it is more direct to relate the chemical potential difference to the standard potential $E^{\\circ}$ of the half-reaction. The standard Gibbs free energy change is given by $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ} = -nFE^{\\circ}$. For our reaction (with $n=1$), this is $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ} = -FE^{\\circ}$. We also have $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}^{\\circ}$ (by convention, the standard chemical potential of the electron at the SHE is zero). This leads to a sign confusion.\n\nLet us be more rigorous by defining $E^\\circ$ through the cell reaction with the SHE. The overall cell reaction is $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{H}_2 \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} + \\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The standard Gibbs free energy for this cell is $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ}_{cell} = -nFE^{\\circ}_{cell}$. Here, $n=1$ and $E^{\\circ}_{cell} = E^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} - E^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{SHE}} = E^{\\circ} - 0 = E^{\\circ}$. Also, $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ}_{cell} = (\\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} + \\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) - (\\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{H}_2})$. By convention $\\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}=0$ and $\\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{H}_2}=0$, so $\\Delta_r G^{\\circ}_{cell} = \\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} - \\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}$. Therefore, $\\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} - \\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}} = -FE^{\\circ}$, which implies $\\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}} - \\mu^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} = FE^{\\circ}$.\n\nSubstituting $FE^{\\circ}$ for $(\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}^{\\circ} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}^{\\circ})$ into our expression for $FEh$:\n$$\nFEh = FE^{\\circ} + RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}} \\right)\n$$\nDividing by $nF$ (with $n=1$) yields the Nernst equation for this half-reaction:\n$$\nEh = E^{\\circ} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}} \\right) = E^{\\circ} - \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the redox potential for the $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}/\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ couple.\n\nThe problem specifies the condition for the boundary line between the dominance of the two species, which is where their activities are equal.

With activity coefficients assumed to be unity, the activities are equal to the concentrations: $a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}} = 10^{-6}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}} = 10^{-6}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived Nernst equation:\n$$\nEh = E^{\\circ} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{10^{-6}}{10^{-6}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nEh = E^{\\circ} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln(1)\n$$\nSince $\\ln(1)=0$, the second term vanishes, regardless of the values of $R$, $T$, or $F$.\n$$\nEh = E^{\\circ}\n$$\nGiven the standard potential $E^{\\circ} = +0.771$ V, the redox potential for this specific condition is:\n$$\nEh = 0.771 \\text{ V}\n$$\n\nTo address the functional dependence $Eh(pH)$, we must examine the derived Nernst equation:\n$$\nEh = E^{\\circ} + \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe term $pH$ is defined as $pH = -\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})$, where $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ is the activity of the hydrogen ion. The governing half-reaction, $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+} + e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, does not involve hydrogen ions ($\\mathrm{H}^{+}$) or hydroxide ions ($\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$). Consequently, the activity $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ does not appear in the reaction quotient, and thus the expression for $Eh$ is not a function of $pH$.\n\nOn an $Eh$-$pH$ diagram, which plots $Eh$ on the vertical axis against $pH$ on the horizontal axis, an equation of the form $y = c$, where $c$ is a constant, represents a horizontal line. Therefore, the boundary line separating the stability fields of the aqueous species $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ and $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ is a horizontal line. For the specific condition where the activities of the two ions are equal ($a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}} = a_{\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}}$), this line is located at $Eh = 0.771$ V. The region above this line ($Eh > 0.771$ V) is the stability field of the oxidized species, $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, while the region below it ($Eh < 0.771$ V) is the stability field of the reduced species, $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$.\n\nThe final numerical value for $Eh$ under the given conditions, rounded to three significant figures, is $0.771$ V.",

Taking the negative base-$10$ logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}\\left(K_w \\sqrt{\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}}}{K_{\\mathrm{sp}}}}\\right) = -\\log_{10}(K_w) - \\frac{1}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}}}{K_{\\mathrm{sp}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{p}K_w - \\frac{1}{2}(\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}}) - \\log_{10}(K_{\\mathrm{sp}}))\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $a_{\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}}} = 10^{-6}$, $K_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-17}$, and $K_w = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$ (which implies $\\mathrm{p}K_w = 14.0$).\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = 14.0 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\log_{10}(10^{-6}) - \\log_{10}(3.0 \\times 10^{-17}))\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = 14.0 - \\frac{1}{2}(-6.0 - (-17 + \\log_{10}(3.0)))\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = 14.0 - \\frac{1}{2}(-6.0 + 17.0 - \\log_{10}(3.0))\n$$\nUsing $\\log_{10}(3.0) \\approx 0.47712$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} \\approx 14.0 - \\frac{1}{2}(11.0 - 0.47712) = 14.0 - \\frac{1}{2}(10.52288) = 14.0 - 5.26144 = 8.73856\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the pH of the low-pH boundary is $8.739$.\n\n**2. High-pH Boundary: Equilibrium between $\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_2(s)}$ and $\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}(aq)}$**\n\nThe high-pH boundary is defined by the equilibrium between solid zinc hydroxide and the tetrahydroxozincate complex, $\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}}$. Under basic conditions, we use hydroxide ions, $\\mathrm{OH^-}$, to balance the reaction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_2(s)} + 2\\,\\mathrm{OH^-(aq)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}(aq)}\n$$\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction, let us call it $K_{high}$, can be derived by combining the given fundamental equilibria:\n1.  $\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_2(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Zn^{2+}(aq)} + 2\\,\\mathrm{OH^-(aq)} \\quad (K_{sp})$\n2.  $\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}(aq)} + 4\\,\\mathrm{OH^-(aq)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}(aq)} \\quad (\\beta_4)$\n\nAdding reaction (1) to the reverse of reaction (2) is not correct. Instead, we can express K_high using a different combination. Let's combine the dissolution of the solid and the formation of the complex:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_2(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Zn^{2+}(aq)} + 2\\,\\mathrm{OH^-(aq)} \\quad (K_{sp})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Zn^{2+}(aq)} + 4\\,\\mathrm{OH^-(aq)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}(aq)} \\quad (\\beta_4)\n$$\nSumming these gives `Zn(OH)2(s) + Zn2+(aq) + 4OH-(aq) => Zn2+(aq) + 2OH-(aq) + Zn(OH)4^2-(aq)`. Canceling terms gives the target reaction: `Zn(OH)2(s) + 2OH-(aq) => Zn(OH)4^2-(aq)`. The equilibrium constant for the target reaction is therefore the product:\n$$\nK_{high} = K_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\cdot \\beta_4\n$$\nApplying the law of mass action to the balanced reaction for the high-pH boundary:\n$$\nK_{high} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_2(s)}} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{OH^-}}^2}\n$$\nWith $a_{\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_2(s)}} = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nK_{high} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}}}}{a_{\\mathrm{OH^-}}^2}\n$$\nSubstituting $K_{high} = K_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\cdot \\beta_4$:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\cdot \\beta_4 = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}}}}{a_{\\mathrm{OH^-}}^2}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the boundary in terms of the activities and the constants $K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ and $\\beta_4$. We solve for the activity of the hydroxide ion, $a_{\\mathrm{OH^-}}$:\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{OH^-}}^2 = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}}}}{K_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\cdot \\beta_4}\n$$\nTo find the pH, we first find the pOH, where $\\mathrm{pOH} = -\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{OH^-}})$. Taking the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the square root of the expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pOH} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}}}}{K_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\cdot \\beta_4}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}}}) - \\log_{10}(K_{\\mathrm{sp}}) - \\log_{10}(\\beta_4))\n$$\nWe substitute the given numerical values: $a_{\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_4^{2-}}} = 10^{-6}$, $K_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-17}$, and $\\beta_4 = 3.0 \\times 10^{15}$.\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{OH^-}}^2 = \\frac{10^{-6}}{(3.0 \\times 10^{-17}) \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{15})} = \\frac{10^{-6}}{9.0 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{1}{9.0} \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\n$$\na_{\\mathrm{OH^-}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{9.0} \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{1}{3.0} \\times 10^{-2}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{pOH} = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{3.0} \\times 10^{-2}\\right) = -\\log_{10}(1/3.0) - \\log_{10}(10^{-2}) = \\log_{10}(3.0) + 2.0\n$$\nUsing $\\log_{10}(3.0) \\approx 0.47712$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pOH} \\approx 0.47712 + 2.0 = 2.47712\n$$\nThe pH is found using the relation $\\mathrm{pH} + \\mathrm{pOH} = \\mathrm{p}K_w = 14.0$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{pH} = 14.0 - \\mathrm{pOH} \\approx 14.0 - 2.47712 = 11.52288\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the pH of the high-pH boundary is $11.52$.\n\nThe two vertical boundaries delimiting the stability of solid $\\mathrm{Zn(OH)_2}$ at a dissolved zinc species activity of $10^{-6}$ are at $\\mathrm{pH} = 8.739$ and $\\mathrm{pH} = 11.52$.",
