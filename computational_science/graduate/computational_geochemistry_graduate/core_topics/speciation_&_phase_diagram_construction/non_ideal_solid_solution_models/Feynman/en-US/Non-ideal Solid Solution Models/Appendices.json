It is a standard derivation in chemical thermodynamics, relevant to the modeling of non-ideal solid solutions in geochemistry. Therefore, the problem is valid and I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe first step is to derive the general expressions for the partial molar excess Gibbs energies, $\\overline{G}_{1}^{ex}$ and $\\overline{G}_{2}^{ex}$, from the given molar excess Gibbs energy of the solution, $g^{ex}$. The partial molar property $\\overline{Y}_{i}$ for a component $i$ in a binary solution is related to the molar property $Y$ by the following relations:\n$$\n\\overline{Y}_{1} = Y + x_{2} \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x_{1}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\overline{Y}_{2} = Y - x_{1} \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial x_{1}}\n$$\nIn this problem, $Y=g^{ex}$, $\\overline{Y}_{1}=\\overline{G}_{1}^{ex}$, and $\\overline{Y}_{2}=\\overline{G}_{2}^{ex}$.

            "problem": "A binary crystalline solid solution between endmember components $A$ and $B$ is investigated at constant pressure with negligible excess volume. Experimental datasets include phase equilibria (miscibility gap), solution calorimetry, and activity measurements from electromotive-force cells. Your task is to decide, based solely on first-principles criteria inferred from these datasets, when a symmetric one-parameter Margules regular-solution model is appropriate versus when an asymmetric two-parameter Margules (or equivalently, a Redlich–Kister expansion requiring odd terms) is required.\n\nObservations at temperature $T$ in the range where the immiscibility gap is present show:\n- The solvus in the $T$–$X_A$ plane is measurably skewed: the crest occurs at $X_A \\approx 0.38$ rather than $X_A = 0.50$, and the two limbs display unequal curvature near $X_A \\approx 0.20$ and $X_A \\approx 0.80$.\n- Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and solution calorimetry indicate positive integral enthalpy of mixing $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ with a composition of maximum endothermic effect near $X_A \\approx 0.35$; the $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ curve is visibly skewed rather than symmetric about $X_A = 0.50$.\n- Dilute-limit measurements of activities yield $\\ln \\gamma_A$ at $X_A \\to 0$ larger than $\\ln \\gamma_B$ at $X_B \\to 0$ by a factor $\\gtrsim 2$ at $T \\approx 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$, with representative estimates $\\ln \\gamma_A(X_A \\approx 0.05) \\approx 1.1$ and $\\ln \\gamma_B(X_B \\approx 0.05) \\approx 0.5$.\n- Measured excess molar volume is small, $|\\Delta V^{\\mathrm{ex}}| \\ll 0.1\\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,mol^{-1}}$, across the full composition range.\n\nUsing only the foundational thermodynamic links among chemical potentials, activity coefficients, excess Gibbs free energy, and the consequences of composition symmetry for a binary mixture, which of the following criteria correctly distinguish when a symmetric one-parameter Margules model is adequate versus when an asymmetric two-parameter Margules model is required? Select all that apply.\n\nA. If the solvus and $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ are both symmetric about $X_A = 0.50$ within uncertainty, and the dilute-limit activity coefficients satisfy $\\lim_{X_A \\to 0}\\ln \\gamma_A = \\lim_{X_B \\to 0}\\ln \\gamma_B$, then a symmetric Margules parameterization is warranted; significant departure from any one of these symmetry conditions necessitates an asymmetric model.\n\nB. Solvus asymmetry at low temperature is not diagnostic; only high-temperature calorimetry can discriminate symmetry. Therefore, a symmetric model remains appropriate whenever $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ has a single maximum, regardless of whether that maximum occurs at $X_A \\neq 0.50$.\n\nC. If both the solvus crest and the maximum of $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ occur at $X_A \\neq 0.50$ and the dilute-limit activity coefficients are unequal, then an asymmetric Margules with distinct interaction parameters for $A$ in $B$ and $B$ in $A$ is supported; moreover, a symmetric model implies vanishing odd-composition terms in the excess free-energy expansion, which is inconsistent with the observed skewness.\n\nD.

            "solution": "We begin from core thermodynamic principles for a binary mixture at constant temperature $T$ and pressure $P$:\n- The molar Gibbs free energy of mixing is $G^{\\mathrm{mix}} = G^{\\mathrm{id}} + G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$, where $G^{\\mathrm{id}} = RT\\left(X_A \\ln X_A + X_B \\ln X_B\\right)$ and $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ captures all non-ideality.\n- The activity coefficients relate to the excess free energy via $\\ln \\gamma_i = \\left(1/RT\\right)\\left(\\partial (nG^{\\mathrm{ex}})/\\partial n_i\\right)_{T,P,n_{j\\neq i}}$, where $n$ is the total amount of substance.\n- The Gibbs–Duhem relation $\\sum_i X_i\\, d\\ln \\gamma_i = 0$ constrains $\\ln \\gamma_A$ and $\\ln \\gamma_B$.\n- Phase separation (immiscibility) in a binary occurs when the common tangent construction applied to $G^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ yields two coexisting compositions; the solvus symmetry in $X_A$ requires $G^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ to be symmetric about $X_A = 0.50$.\n- Composition symmetry of the excess free energy is the condition $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A) = G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(1 - X_A)$, which implies that the expansion of $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ in orthogonal polynomials of $(2X_A - 1)$ contains only even-order terms. In the Redlich–Kister representation this corresponds to vanishing odd coefficients, and in the Margules representation to equality of cross-interaction parameters (a symmetric one-parameter model).\n- The enthalpy of mixing satisfies $H^{\\mathrm{mix}} = G^{\\mathrm{mix}} - T\\left(\\partial G^{\\mathrm{mix}}/\\partial T\\right)_{P,\\{n_i\\}}$, hence $H^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ inherits composition symmetry properties of $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ apart from smooth temperature dependences of interaction parameters; asymmetry in $H^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A)$ is therefore a direct indicator of asymmetry in $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A)$ at the same $T$.\n\nConsequences of symmetry for dilute limits and the solvus:\n1. In a symmetric one-parameter Margules (or any symmetric $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$), the equality $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A) = G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(1 - X_A)$ enforces equality of the dilute-limit activity coefficients: $\\lim_{X_A \\to 0}\\ln \\gamma_A = \\lim_{X_B \\to 0}\\ln \\gamma_B$. This follows from the definition of the partial molar excess Gibbs free energy and interchange symmetry of $A$ and $B$.\n2. The same symmetry implies that the common tangent construction yields coexisting compositions symmetric about $X_A = 0.50$, with the solvus crest at $X_A = 0.50$ and mirror-image limbs.\n3. If odd-composition terms in $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ are required (e.g., nonzero first or third Redlich–Kister coefficients), then $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A) \\neq G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(1 - X_A)$, so both the solvus and $H^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A)$ will be skewed, and the dilute-limit activity coefficients will generally be unequal.\n\nApplying these principles to the observations:\n- The measured solvus is skewed, with a crest at $X_A \\approx 0.38 \\neq 0.50$ and unequal limb curvatures. This contradicts the symmetry expected of a symmetric $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ and supports the need for asymmetry.\n- The calorimetric $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ has its maximum at $X_A \\approx 0.35 \\neq 0.50$ and is skewed. Because $H^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A)$ inherits the composition symmetry properties of $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A)$ (modulo smooth $T$-dependence of parameters), this also indicates asymmetry.\n- The dilute-limit activity coefficients are unequal: representative values $\\ln \\gamma_A(X_A \\approx 0.05) \\approx 1.1$ and $\\ln \\gamma_B(X_B \\approx 0.05) \\approx 0.5$ at $T \\approx 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$ suggest $\\lim_{X_A \\to 0}\\ln \\gamma_A  \\lim_{X_B \\to 0}\\ln \\gamma_B$. A symmetric Margules would predict equality in the strict dilute limits, so this observation is inconsistent with symmetry.\n- The excess molar volume being small does not constrain the symmetry of $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$; it only suggests that $\\Delta V^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ contributions to nonideality are negligible.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option states that simultaneous symmetry in the solvus and $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$, together with equality of the dilute-limit activity coefficients, supports a symmetric Margules; conversely, significant departure from any one of these symmetry conditions necessitates asymmetry. This is consistent with the derivations: symmetry of $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ implies all three observable symmetries, and violation of any one indicates that $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A) \\neq G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(1 - X_A)$, requiring an asymmetric representation (e.g., distinct Margules parameters or odd Redlich–Kister terms). Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This asserts that solvus asymmetry is not diagnostic and that the mere presence of a single maximum in $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}$ suffices for a symmetric model regardless of the maximum’s location. This is incorrect. The location of the maximum is diagnostic: a maximum at $X_A \\neq 0.50$ directly indicates asymmetry in $H^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A)$ and thus in $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A)$. Furthermore, solvus asymmetry is diagnostic because a symmetric $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ must yield a solvus symmetric about $X_A = 0.50$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. This option collects three independent asymmetry indicators: skewed solvus crest, skewed $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ maximum, and unequal dilute-limit activity coefficients; it then notes that a symmetric model would require vanishing odd terms in a composition expansion of $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$, which conflicts with the observed skewness. This aligns with first principles and with the observations. Verdict: Correct.\n\nD. This claims that small $\\Delta V^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ implies symmetric mixing energetics. This conflates volumetric nonideality with the symmetry of the excess Gibbs free energy. Symmetry pertains to composition interchange of $A$ and $B$ in $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$; a small or zero excess volume does not force $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(X_A)$ to equal $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}(1 - X_A)$, nor does it impose equality of dilute-limit activity coefficients. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This suggests that composition asymmetry in $\\ln \\gamma_i$ can be absorbed purely by temperature dependence in a single symmetric parameter. Temperature dependence cannot convert an even-in-composition $G^{\\mathrm{ex}}$ (symmetric model) into an odd-skewed function of composition at fixed $T$; the observed difference in the shapes and inflection loci of $\\ln \\gamma_A(X_A)$ and $\\ln \\gamma_B(X_B)$ reflects composition asymmetry requiring distinct composition dependences (e.g., two-parameter Margules or odd Redlich–Kister terms). Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct selections are A and C. The experimental observations provided jointly satisfy the asymmetry criteria in A and C and contradict the premises of B, D, and E. A symmetric one-parameter Margules could only be justified if all three symmetry diagnostics held within uncertainty: symmetric solvus, symmetric $\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{mix}}(X_A)$ about $X_A = 0.50$, and equality of dilute-limit activity coefficients. Otherwise, an asymmetric two-parameter Margules (or an equivalent representation with odd terms) is required.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the estimation of the asymmetric two-parameter Margules interaction parameters, $W_{12}$ and $W_{21}$, from experimental solvus data. The data consists of pairs of equilibrium compositions, $(x_{\\alpha,i}, x_{\\beta,i})$, at corresponding temperatures, $T_i$. The theoretical framework is the common-tangent construction applied to the Gibbs free energy of mixing, which leads to a set of linear equations in the unknowns $W_{12}$ and $W_{21}$. A linear least-squares method is employed to solve this overdetermined system.\n\nThe molar Gibbs free energy of mixing, $g_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is given by\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{mix}}(x,T) = RT \\big[x \\ln x + (1-x)\\ln(1-x)\\big] + x(1-x)\\big[W_{12}(1-x) + W_{21}x\\big]\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the mole fraction of component $1$, $R$ is the Universal Gas Constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe two conditions for phase equilibrium at compositions $x_{\\alpha}$ and $x_{\\beta}$ are:\n1. Equality of the slopes of the tangent to $g_{\\mathrm{mix}}(x,T)$: $\\frac{d g_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{d x}(x_{\\alpha},T) = \\frac{d g_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{d x}(x_{\\beta},T)$\n2. Equality of the intercepts of the tangent lines: $g_{\\mathrm{mix}}(x_{\\alpha},T) - x_{\\alpha}\\frac{d g_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{d x}(x_{\\alpha},T) = g_{\\mathrm{mix}}(x_{\\beta},T) - x_{\\beta}\\frac{d g_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{d x}(x_{\\beta},T)$\n\nWe will linearize these two conditions with respect to $W_{12}$ and $W_{21}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the first derivative of $g_{\\mathrm{mix}}(x,T)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d g_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( RT \\big[x \\ln x + (1-x)\\ln(1-x)\\big] \\right) + \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( g^E(x) \\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of the ideal mixing term is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( RT \\big[x \\ln x + (1-x)\\ln(1-x)\\big] \\right) = RT\\left(\\ln x + 1 - \\ln(1-x) - 1\\right) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)\n$$\nThe excess energy term $g^E(x)$ can be written as $g^E(x) = W_{12}x(1-x)^2 + W_{21}x^2(1-x)$. Differentiating this gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d g^E}{dx} = W_{12}\\left((1-x)^2 - 2x(1-x)\\right) + W_{21}\\left(2x(1-x) - x^2\\right) = W_{12}(1-x)(1-3x) + W_{21}x(2-3x)\n$$\nSo, the full derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d g_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{dx} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right) + W_{12}(1-x)(1-3x) + W_{21}x(2-3x)\n$$\n\nNow, we formulate the two linear equations for each data point $(T, x_{\\alpha}, x_{\\beta})$.\n\n**Equation 1: From the equality of derivatives**\nApplying the first equilibrium condition $\\frac{d g_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{d x}(x_{\\alpha},T) = \\frac{d g_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{d x}(x_{\\beta},T)$:\n$$\nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_\\alpha}{1-x_\\alpha}\\right) + W_{12}(1-x_\\alpha)(1-3x_\\alpha) + W_{21}x_\\alpha(2-3x_\\alpha) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_\\beta}{1-x_\\beta}\\right) + W_{12}(1-x_\\beta)(1-3x_\\beta) + W_{21}x_\\beta(2-3x_\\beta)\n$$\nRearranging to group terms with $W_{12}$ and $W_{21}$:\n$$\nW_{12} \\underbrace{\\left[ (1-x_\\alpha)(1-3x_\\alpha) - (1-x_\\beta)(1-3x_\\beta) \\right]}_{A_1} + W_{21} \\underbrace{\\left[ x_\\alpha(2-3x_\\alpha) - x_\\beta(2-3x_\\beta) \\right]}_{B_1} = \\underbrace{RT\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{x_\\beta}{1-x_\\beta}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_\\alpha}{1-x_\\alpha}\\right)\\right]}_{C_1}\n$$\nThis gives our first linear equation for each data point: $A_1 W_{12} + B_1 W_{21} = C_1$.\n\n**Equation 2: From the equality of tangent intercepts**\nThe intercept term $g_{\\mathrm{mix}}(x) - x\\frac{d g_{\\mathrm{mix}}}{dx}$ is the chemical potential of component $2$, $\\mu_2(x)$.\n$$\n\\mu_2(x) = RT\\ln(1-x) + \\mu_2^E(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_2^E(x) = g^E(x) - x\\frac{d g^E}{dx}$. Using our expressions for $g^E(x)$ and its derivative:\n$$\n\\mu_2^E(x) = \\left[W_{12}x(1-x)^2 + W_{21}x^2(1-x)\\right] - x\\left[W_{12}(1-x)(1-3x) + W_{21}x(2-3x)\\right]\n$$\nAfter simplification, this becomes:\n$$\n\\mu_2^E(x) = W_{12}\\left(2x^2(1-x)\\right) + W_{21}\\left(x^2(2x-1)\\right)\n$$\nThe second equilibrium condition is $\\mu_2(x_\\alpha, T) = \\mu_2(x_\\beta, T)$:\n$$\nRT\\ln(1-x_\\alpha) + W_{12}(2x_\\alpha^2(1-x_\\alpha)) + W_{21}(x_\\alpha^2(2x_\\alpha-1)) = RT\\ln(1-x_\\beta) + W_{12}(2x_\\beta^2(1-x_\\beta)) + W_{21}(x_\\beta^2(2x_\\beta-1))\n$$\nRearranging to isolate $W_{12}$ and $W_{21}$:\n$$\nW_{12} \\underbrace{\\left[ 2x_\\alpha^2(1-x_\\alpha) - 2x_\\beta^2(1-x_\\beta) \\right]}_{A_2} + W_{21} \\underbrace{\\left[ x_\\alpha^2(2x_\\alpha-1) - x_\\beta^2(2x_\\beta-1) \\right]}_{B_2} = \\underbrace{RT\\left[\\ln(1-x_\\beta) - \\ln(1-x_\\alpha)\\right]}_{C_2}\n$$\nThis gives our second linear equation for each data point: $A_2 W_{12} + B_2 W_{21} = C_2$.\n\n**Least-Squares Formulation**\nFor a dataset with $N$ measurement points $\\{(T_i, x_{\\alpha,i}, x_{\\beta,i})\\}_{i=1}^N$, we obtain $2N$ linear equations for the two unknowns $W_{12}$ and $W_{21}$. This overdetermined system can be written in matrix form as $\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{d}$, where $\\mathbf{w} = [W_{12}, W_{21}]^T$. The matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ and vector $\\mathbf{d}$ are assembled as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{1,1}  B_{1,1} \\\\ A_{2,1}  B_{2,1} \\\\ A_{1,2}  B_{1,2} \\\\ A_{2,2}  B_{2,2} \\\\ \\vdots  \\vdots \\\\ A_{1,N}  B_{1,N} \\\\ A_{2,N}  B_{2,N} \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{d} = \\begin{pmatrix} C_{1,1} \\\\ C_{2,1} \\\\ C_{1,2} \\\\ C_{2,2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ C_{1,N} \\\\ C_{2,N} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe goal is to find the vector $\\mathbf{w}$ that minimizes the sum of the squares of the residuals, $||\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{d}||_2^2$. This is a standard linear least-squares problem, which can be solved numerically. The solution provides the best-fit estimates for $W_{12}$ and $W_{21}$.\n\nThe computational implementation will construct the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ and vector $\\mathbf{d}$ from the provided datasets and use the `numpy.linalg.lstsq` function to find the optimal parameter values.",
