It requires a derivation from first principles, which is an objective process.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is a standard, well-posed problem in aqueous geochemistry.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will be derived as requested.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the definitions of chemical potential and the condition for chemical equilibrium.\n\nFor a general chemical reaction $\\sum_i \\nu_i S_i = 0$, where $S_i$ are the chemical species and $\\nu_i$ are their stoichiometric coefficients (negative for reactants, positive for products), the condition for equilibrium at constant temperature and pressure is that the Gibbs free energy change of reaction is zero: $\\Delta G_r = 0$. This can be expressed in terms of chemical potentials $\\mu_i$ as:\n$$ \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i = 0 $$\nThe chemical potential of species $i$ is given by $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i$, where $\\mu_i^\\circ$ is the standard state chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $a_i$ is the activity of species $i$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equilibrium condition:\n$$ \\sum_i \\nu_i (\\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\sum_i \\nu_i \\ln a_i = 0 $$\nThe first term, $\\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i^\\circ$, is the standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction, denoted $\\Delta G_r^\\circ$. The second term can be rewritten using properties of logarithms:\n$$ \\Delta G_r^\\circ + RT \\ln \\left( \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i} \\right) = 0 $$\nAt equilibrium, the product term $\\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i}$ is defined as the equilibrium constant, $K$.\n$$ K = \\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i} $$\nThis is the law of mass action expressed in terms of activities. The relationship between $\\Delta G_r^\\circ$ and $K$ is thus $\\Delta G_r^\\circ = -RT \\ln K$.\n\nNow, we apply this general result to the two specific dissolution reactions.\n\n**1. Calcite Dissolution:** $\\text{CaCO}_3(\\text{s, calcite}) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ca}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + \\text{CO}_3^{2-}(\\text{aq})$\nThe stoichiometric coefficients are $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3(s)}} = -1$, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} = +1$, and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} = +1$.\nThe law of mass action gives the equilibrium constant $K_{\\mathrm{calcite}}$:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}}^{\\,+1} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}}^{\\,+1}}{a_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3(s, calcite)}}^{\\,+1}} $$\nGiven that the activity of a pure solid is $1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} $$\n\n**2. Aragonite Dissolution:** $\\text{CaCO}_3(\\text{s, aragonite}) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ca}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + \\text{CO}_3^{2-}(\\text{aq})$\nBy identical reasoning, the equilibrium constant $K_{\\mathrm{aragonite}}$ is:\n$$ K_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} $$\n\nTo construct the activity-activity diagram, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of these equations.\nFor calcite:\n$$ \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = \\log_{10} (a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}}) = \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} + \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} $$\nFor aragonite:\n$$ \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = \\log_{10} (a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}}) = \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} + \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} $$\n\nThe diagram axes are defined as $y = \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}}$ and $x = \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}}$. We rearrange the equations into the standard linear form $y = mx + c$.\n\nFor the calcite boundary:\n$$ \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} = -1 \\cdot \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} + \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{calcite}} $$\nThis equation has a slope $m_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = -1$ and a vertical intercept $c_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = -8.48$.\n\nFor the aragonite boundary:\n$$ \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} = -1 \\cdot \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} + \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} $$\nThis equation has a slope $m_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = -1$ and a vertical intercept $c_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = -8.34$.\n\n**Interpreting the Results:**\n- **Parallelism (Slope):** The slopes of both lines are $m = -1$. In general, for a reaction boundary plotted on axes $\\log a_Y$ vs. $\\log a_X$, the slope is given by $m = -\\nu_X / \\nu_Y$, where $\\nu_X$ and $\\nu_Y$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of the species on the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively. For both calcite and aragonite dissolution, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} = 1$ and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} = 1$. The slope is therefore $m = -1/1 = -1$ for both. The lines are parallel because the ratio of the stoichiometric coefficients of the plotted aqueous species is identical for both reactions.\n\n- **Intercept Difference:** The vertical intercepts are $c_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{calcite}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{aragonite}}$. The problem gives $\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = -8.48$ and $\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = -8.34$. These values are different. The intercepts are different because the equilibrium constants $K$ are different for the two dissolution reactions. The equilibrium constant is related to the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction by $\\Delta G_r^\\circ = -RT \\ln K = -2.303 RT \\log_{10} K$. Since calcite and aragonite are different mineral polymorphs, they have different standard Gibbs free energies of formation ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{calcite}}^\\circ \\neq \\mu_{\\mathrm{aragonite}}^\\circ$). This leads to different $\\Delta G_r^\\circ$ values for their dissolution and consequently different $K$ values. The different intercepts directly reflect the different standard Gibbs free energies of the reactions.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Parallelism indicates identical ratios of stoichiometric coefficients for the plotted aqueous species on the axes; the different intercepts arise from different $\\log_{10} K$ values (equivalently different standard Gibbs free energy changes, $\\Delta G^\\circ$) for the reactions, with other activities held fixed.**\nThis statement is a precise summary of the derived results. The parallelism is due to the identical stoichiometry of the aqueous products ($1:1$ ratio), which sets the slope to $-1$ for both. The different intercepts are due to the different values of $\\log_{10} K$, which are a direct consequence of the different standard Gibbs free energies of the two mineral polymorphs.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Parallelism indicates the reactions have identical $\\log_{10} K$ values; the different intercepts arise solely from differences in activity coefficients, since activities are non-ideal.**\nThis is incorrect. Parallelism is related to stoichiometry (the slope), not the value of $K$ (the intercept). Furthermore, the problem explicitly states that different intercepts are observed, which implies different $\\log_{10} K$ values. The intercepts are thermodynamic constants related to $\\Delta G_r^\\circ$, not variables dependent on activity coefficients in the solution, especially since the diagram is plotted in terms of activities directly.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Parallelism indicates that both reactions exchange the same total ionic charge between the plotted species; the different intercepts reflect differences in ionic strength, not equilibrium thermodynamics.**\nThe first part about ionic charge is a related consequence of the stoichiometry but is not the direct mathematical reason for the slope, which is the ratio of coefficients. The second part is incorrect. Intercepts are determined by $\\log_{10} K$, a fundamental thermodynamic parameter. While ionic strength affects activity coefficients, it does not change the thermodynamic equilibrium constant $K$. The difference in intercepts reflects a fundamental difference in the stability of calcite versus aragonite ($\\Delta G_r^\\circ$), not a property of the solution like ionic strength.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Parallel boundaries cannot arise for distinct minerals at fixed temperature, because this would violate thermodynamic uniqueness and imply the same reaction free energy.**\nThis statement is false. As derived, parallel boundaries arise whenever the reactions involving two distinct minerals produce the plotted aqueous species in the same stoichiometric ratio. Parallelism (same slope) is independent of the intercepts. Different intercepts imply different $\\log_{10} K$ values and thus different standard reaction free energies ($\\Delta G_r^\\circ$), which is exactly what is expected for two distinct minerals. There is no violation of thermodynamic uniqueness.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The dissolution reaction is:\n$$ \\text{CaMg(CO}_3)_2(\\text{s}) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ca}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + \\text{Mg}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + 2\\,\\text{CO}_3^{2-}(\\text{aq}) $$\nThe equilibrium constant, $K_{\\mathrm{dol}}$, is defined by the law of mass action.

The solution is in equilibrium with dolomite, which means $\\text{SI}_{\\text{dolomite}} = 0$.\n2. The saturation indices of calcite and magnesite are equal: $\\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}} = \\text{SI}_{\\text{magnesite}}$.\n\nThe intersection point lies on the dolomite stability boundary, so the solution is saturated with respect to dolomite ($\\text{SI}_{\\text{dolomite}} = 0$) by definition. We must evaluate the saturation index for calcite (and thus magnesite) at this point to determine if they are also at equilibrium. Using the problem's definition $\\text{SI} = \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}/K)$:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}} = \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}_{\\text{calcite}}) - \\log_{10}(K_{\\text{calcite}}) $$\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}} = \\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}}) - \\log_{10}(K_{\\text{calcite}}) $$\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}} = \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} + \\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} - \\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{cal}} $$\nSubstituting the values at the intersection point: $\\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} = -5.48$, $\\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}} = -3$, and $\\log_{10} K_{\\mathrm{cal}} = -8.48$:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}} = -5.48 + (-3) - (-8.48) = -8.48 + 8.48 = 0 $$\nSince $\\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}} = 0$, the solution is also in equilibrium with calcite. Because the point also lies on the boundary where $\\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}} = \\text{SI}_{\\text{magnesite}}$, it follows directly that $\\text{SI}_{\\text{magnesite}} = 0$ as well.\nAt this unique point, the saturation indices for all three minerals are zero:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}} = \\text{SI}_{\\text{magnesite}} = \\text{SI}_{\\text{dolomite}} = 0 $$\nThis means the aqueous solution is simultaneously in equilibrium with all three solid phases. Therefore, the mineral assemblage that can coexist at equilibrium with the aqueous solution at this point is calcite, magnesite, and dolomite. This point is a triple point in the activity diagram for this system.\n\nThe final numerical answers for the coordinates of the intersection point, rounded to four significant figures, are $\\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}} = -5.480$ and $\\log_{10} a_{\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}} = -5.600$.",

Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with providing a complete solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation of SI expressions**\n\nThe Saturation Index (SI) is defined as $\\text{SI} = \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}/K)$, which can be written as $\\text{SI} = \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}) - \\log_{10}(K)$. The Ion Activity Product (IAP) is the product of the activities of the aqueous species, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient in the dissolution reaction.\n\nFor calcite, the dissolution reaction is $\\text{CaCO}_{3}(\\text{s}) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ca}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + \\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}(\\text{aq})$.\nThe IAP for calcite is $\\text{IAP}_{\\text{calcite}} = a_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}} a_{\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}}$.\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}_{\\text{calcite}}) = \\log_{10}(a_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}) + \\log_{10}(a_{\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}}) $$\nSubstituting the given parameterized expressions for the activities as a function of $t$:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}_{\\text{calcite}}(t)) = (-4 + 0.5t) + (-9 + t) = 1.5t - 13 $$\nNow, we can find the expression for $\\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}}(t)$:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}}(t) = \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}_{\\text{calcite}}(t)) - \\log_{10}(K_{\\text{calcite}}) $$\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}}(t) = (1.5t - 13) - (-8.48) = 1.5t - 4.52 $$\n\nFor dolomite, the dissolution reaction is $\\text{CaMg}(\\text{CO}_{3})_{2}(\\text{s}) \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Ca}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + \\text{Mg}^{2+}(\\text{aq}) + 2\\,\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}(\\text{aq})$.\nThe IAP for dolomite is $\\text{IAP}_{\\text{dolomite}} = a_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}} a_{\\text{Mg}^{2+}} (a_{\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}})^{2}$.\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}_{\\text{dolomite}}) = \\log_{10}(a_{\\text{Ca}^{2+}}) + \\log_{10}(a_{\\text{Mg}^{2+}}) + 2\\log_{10}(a_{\\text{CO}_{3}^{2-}}) $$\nSubstituting the given parameterized and constant activity expressions:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}_{\\text{dolomite}}(t)) = (-4 + 0.5t) + (-3) + 2(-9 + t) $$\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}_{\\text{dolomite}}(t)) = -4 + 0.5t - 3 - 18 + 2t = 2.5t - 25 $$\nNow, we can find the expression for $\\text{SI}_{\\text{dolomite}}(t)$:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{dolomite}}(t) = \\log_{10}(\\text{IAP}_{\\text{dolomite}}(t)) - \\log_{10}(K_{\\text{dolomite}}) $$\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{dolomite}}(t) = (2.5t - 25) - (-17.09) = 2.5t - 7.91 $$\n\nThe explicit expressions are $\\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}}(t) = 1.5t - 4.52$ and $\\text{SI}_{\\text{dolomite}}(t) = 2.5t - 7.91$.\n\n**2. Determination of transition points**\n\nA mineral transitions from undersaturation ($\\text{SI}  0$) to supersaturation ($\\text{SI}  0$) at the point of equilibrium, where $\\text{SI} = 0$. We need to find the value of the parameter $t$ where this occurs for each mineral.\n\nFor calcite, we set $\\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}}(t) = 0$:\n$$ 1.5t - 4.52 = 0 $$\n$$ 1.5t = 4.52 $$\n$$ t_{\\text{calcite}} = \\frac{4.52}{1.5} = \\frac{9.04}{3} \\approx 3.0133 $$\nSince $0 \\le t_{\\text{calcite}} \\le 4$, this transition occurs within the specified segment.\n\nFor dolomite, we set $\\text{SI}_{\\text{dolomite}}(t) = 0$:\n$$ 2.5t - 7.91 = 0 $$\n$$ 2.5t = 7.91 $$\n$$ t_{\\text{dolomite}} = \\frac{7.91}{2.5} = \\frac{15.82}{5} = 3.164 $$\nSince $0 \\le t_{\\text{dolomite}} \\le 4$, this transition also occurs within the segment.\n\n**3. Identification of simultaneous supersaturation and fractional length**\n\nA mineral is supersaturated when its saturation index is greater than zero ($\\text{SI}  0$).\n\nFor calcite to be supersaturated:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{calcite}}(t)  0 \\implies 1.5t - 4.52  0 \\implies t  \\frac{4.52}{1.5} \\approx 3.0133 $$\nThe interval for calcite supersaturation is $(t_{\\text{calcite}}, 4]$.\n\nFor dolomite to be supersaturated:\n$$ \\text{SI}_{\\text{dolomite}}(t)  0 \\implies 2.5t - 7.91  0 \\implies t  \\frac{7.91}{2.5} = 3.164 $$\nThe interval for dolomite supersaturation is $(t_{\\text{dolomite}}, 4]$.\n\nBoth minerals are simultaneously supersaturated when $t$ is in the intersection of these two intervals. Since $t_{\\text{dolomite}} = 3.164$ is greater than $t_{\\text{calcite}} \\approx 3.0133$, the intersection is determined by the larger lower bound.\nThe interval of simultaneous supersaturation is $(3.164, 4]$.\n\nThe length of this interval is $L_{\\text{super}} = 4 - 3.164 = 0.836$.\nThe total length of the line segment is for $t \\in [0, 4]$, so its length is $L_{\\text{total}} = 4 - 0 = 4$.\n\nThe fraction of the total segment length where both minerals are simultaneously supersaturated is:\n$$ f = \\frac{L_{\\text{super}}}{L_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{0.836}{4} = 0.209 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fraction is $0.2090$.",
