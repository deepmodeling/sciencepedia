This exercise delves into the heart of kinetic isotope geochemistry by asking you to model the time-dependent exchange of isotopes between two reservoirs.

            "problem": "Consider isotopic exchange of a rare heavy isotope between two ($2$) well-mixed phases, denoted phase $A$ and phase $B$, at constant temperature and pressure. Let the total number of exchangeable sites (atoms of the element of interest, regardless of isotope) be $N_A$ in phase $A$ and $N_B$ in phase $B$, with $N_A$ and $N_B$ constant in time. Let $H_A(t)$ and $H_B(t)$ be the numbers of heavy isotopes in phases $A$ and $B$, respectively, with $H_A(t) + H_B(t) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ conserved. Define the isotopic ratios $R_A(t) = H_A(t)/N_A$ and $R_B(t) = H_B(t)/N_B$, and the instantaneous fractionation factor $\\alpha(t) = R_A(t)/R_B(t)$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, containing all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for two results: the coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the system and the time-dependent fractionation factor $\\alpha(t)$.\n\n1. Derivation of the Coupled ODEs\n\nThe system consists of two phases, $A$ and $B$. The number of heavy isotopes in each phase is $H_A(t)$ and $H_B(t)$, respectively. The rate of change of the number of heavy isotopes in a given phase is equal to the flux of heavy isotopes into that phase minus the flux of heavy isotopes out of that phase.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the flux of heavy isotopes from phase $A$ to phase $B$ is given by $k_f H_A(t)$, and the flux from phase $B$ to phase $A$ is given by $k_r H_B(t)$, where $k_f$ and $k_r$ are constant rate coefficients.\n\nFor phase $A$, the flux in is from phase $B$, and the flux out is to phase $B$. Therefore, the net rate of change of $H_A(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dH_A}{dt} = (\\text{Flux in}) - (\\text{Flux out}) = k_r H_B(t) - k_f H_A(t)\n$$\n\nFor phase $B$, the flux in is from phase $A$, and the flux out is to phase $A$. Therefore, the net rate of change of $H_B(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dH_B}{dt} = (\\text{Flux in}) - (\\text{Flux out}) = k_f H_A(t) - k_r H_B(t)\n$$\n\nThese two equations form the system of coupled linear ordinary differential equations for $H_A(t)$ and $H_B(t)$. Note that adding the two equations gives $\\frac{d}{dt}(H_A(t) + H_B(t)) = 0$, which is consistent with the stated conservation law $H_A(t) + H_B(t) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\n2. Solution for the Time-Dependent Fractionation Factor $\\alpha(t)$\n\nTo solve for $\\alpha(t)$, we must first find the explicit solutions for $H_A(t)$ and $H_B(t)$. We can use the conservation law $H_B(t) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_A(t)$ to decouple the ODEs. Substituting this into the equation for $dH_A/dt$:\n$$\n\\frac{dH_A}{dt} = k_r (H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_A(t)) - k_f H_A(t)\n$$\nRearranging this gives a linear first-order ODE for $H_A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dH_A}{dt} + (k_f + k_r) H_A(t) = k_r H_{\\mathrm{tot}}\n$$\nThe general solution to an equation of the form $y' + py = q$ is $y(t) = y_p(t) + y_h(t)$, where $y_p$ is a particular solution and $y_h$ is the solution to the homogeneous equation.\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{dH_A}{dt} + (k_f + k_r) H_A(t) = 0$, which has the solution $C \\exp(-(k_f + k_r)t)$ for some constant $C$.\nThe right-hand side is constant, so we seek a constant particular solution, $H_A(\\infty)$. At steady state ($t \\to \\infty$), $dH_A/dt = 0$, so $(k_f + k_r) H_A(\\infty) = k_r H_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. This gives the particular (or equilibrium) solution:\n$$\nH_A(\\infty) = \\frac{k_r H_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{k_f + k_r}\n$$\nThe general solution for $H_A(t)$ is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n$$\nH_A(t) = H_A(\\infty) + C \\exp(-(k_f + k_r)t)\n$$\nThe constant $C$ is determined by the initial condition at $t=0$. We are given $R_A(0)=R_{A0}$, so $H_A(0) = N_A R_{A0}$.\nAt $t=0$: $H_A(0) = H_A(\\infty) + C$.\nThus, $C = H_A(0) - H_A(\\infty)$. The full solution for $H_A(t)$ is:\n$$\nH_A(t) = H_A(\\infty) + (H_A(0) - H_A(\\infty)) \\exp(-(k_f + k_r)t)\n$$\nUsing the conservation laws $H_A(t) + H_B(t) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, $H_A(0) + H_B(0) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, and $H_A(\\infty) + H_B(\\infty) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, we can derive a symmetrical expression for $H_B(t)$:\n$$\nH_B(t) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_A(t) = (H_A(\\infty) + H_B(\\infty)) - [H_A(\\infty) + (H_A(0) - H_A(\\infty))\\exp(-(k_f+k_r)t)]\n$$\n$$\nH_B(t) = H_B(\\infty) - (H_A(0) - H_A(\\infty))\\exp(-(k_f+k_r)t)\n$$\nFrom conservation, $H_A(0) - H_A(\\infty) = -(H_B(0) - H_B(\\infty))$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\nH_B(t) = H_B(\\infty) + (H_B(0) - H_B(\\infty))\\exp(-(k_f + k_r)t)\n$$\nThe instantaneous fractionation factor is defined as $\\alpha(t) = \\frac{R_A(t)}{R_B(t)} = \\frac{H_A(t)/N_A}{H_B(t)/N_B} = \\frac{N_B}{N_A}\\frac{H_A(t)}{H_B(t)}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $H_A(t)$ and $H_B(t)$:\n$$\n\\alpha(t) = \\frac{N_B}{N_A} \\frac{H_A(\\infty) + (H_A(0) - H_A(\\infty)) e^{-(k_f+k_r)t}}{H_B(\\infty) + (H_B(0) - H_B(\\infty)) e^{-(k_f+k_r)t}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the explicit definitions of all terms.\n$H_A(0) = N_A R_{A0}$ and $H_B(0) = N_B R_{B0}$.\n$H_{\\mathrm{tot}} = N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0}$.\n$H_A(\\infty) = \\frac{k_r H_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{k_f+k_r} = \\frac{k_r(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0})}{k_f+k_r}$.\n$H_B(\\infty) = H_{\\mathrm{tot}} - H_A(\\infty) = \\frac{k_f H_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{k_f+k_r} = \\frac{k_f(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0})}{k_f+k_r}$.\nLet's expand the numerator of the fraction $\\frac{H_A(t)}{H_B(t)}$:\nNumerator: $\\frac{k_r(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0})}{k_f+k_r} + \\left(N_A R_{A0} - \\frac{k_r(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0})}{k_f+k_r}\\right) e^{-(k_f+k_r)t}$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{k_f+k_r} \\left[ k_r(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0}) + (N_A R_{A0}(k_f+k_r) - k_r(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0})) e^{-(k_f+k_r)t} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{k_f+k_r} \\left[ k_r(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0}) + (N_A R_{A0} k_f - N_B R_{B0} k_r) e^{-(k_f+k_r)t} \\right]\n$$\nSimilarly, for the denominator of $\\frac{H_A(t)}{H_B(t)}$:\nDenominator: $\\frac{k_f(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0})}{k_f+k_r} + \\left(N_B R_{B0} - \\frac{k_f(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0})}{k_f+k_r}\\right) e^{-(k_f+k_r)t}$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{k_f+k_r} \\left[ k_f(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0}) + (N_B R_{B0}(k_f+k_r) - k_f(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0})) e^{-(k_f+k_r)t} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{k_f+k_r} \\left[ k_f(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0}) + (N_B R_{B0} k_r - N_A R_{A0} k_f) e^{-(k_f+k_r)t} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{k_f+k_r} \\left[ k_f(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0}) - (N_A R_{A0} k_f - N_B R_{B0} k_r) e^{-(k_f+k_r)t} \\right]\n$$\nCombining these into the expression for $\\alpha(t)$, the common factor of $1/(k_f+k_r)$ cancels:\n$$\n\\alpha(t) = \\frac{N_B}{N_A} \\frac{k_r(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0}) + (N_A k_f R_{A0} - N_B k_r R_{B0}) \\exp(-(k_f+k_r)t)}{k_f(N_A R_{A0} + N_B R_{B0}) - (N_A k_f R_{A0} - N_B k_r R_{B0}) \\exp(-(k_f+k_r)t)}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for $\\alpha(t)$ in terms of the specified parameters.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of stable isotope geochemistry, well-posed with all necessary data and definitions, and objective in its formulation. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the isotopic anomaly, denoted as $\\Delta'^{17}\\mathrm{O}$, and then calculate its value. The anomaly represents the deviation of a measured sample from a defined mass-dependent fractionation line in a three-isotope plot of $\\delta'^{17}\\mathrm{O}$ versus $\\delta'^{18}\\mathrm{O}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the logarithmic delta value, $\\delta'^{i}\\mathrm{O}$, and the fractionation factor, $\\alpha_{i}$. The problem provides the following definitions:\nThe isotope ratio is $R_{i} \\equiv \\left(^{i}\\mathrm{O}/^{16}\\mathrm{O}\\right)$.\nThe fractionation factor is $\\alpha_{i} \\equiv \\frac{R_{i,\\mathrm{sample}}}{R_{i,\\mathrm{standard}}}$.\nThe classical delta notation is $\\delta^{i}\\mathrm{O} = \\left(\\frac{R_{i,\\mathrm{sample}}}{R_{i,\\mathrm{standard}}} - 1\\right) \\times 1000$.\nSubstituting the definition of $\\alpha_i$ into the expression for $\\delta^{i}\\mathrm{O}$ gives:\n$$ \\delta^{i}\\mathrm{O} = (\\alpha_i - 1) \\times 1000 $$\nFrom this, we can write $\\alpha_i$ in terms of $\\delta^{i}\\mathrm{O}$:\n$$ \\alpha_i = 1 + \\frac{\\delta^{i}\\mathrm{O}}{1000} $$\nThe logarithmic delta, $\\delta'^{i}\\mathrm{O}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\delta'^{i}\\mathrm{O} = 1000 \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\delta^{i}\\mathrm{O}}{1000}\\right) $$\nBy substituting the expression for $1 + \\frac{\\delta^{i}\\mathrm{O}}{1000}$, we obtain a direct relationship between $\\delta'^{i}\\mathrm{O}$ and $\\alpha_i$:\n$$ \\delta'^{i}\\mathrm{O} = 1000 \\ln(\\alpha_i) $$\nThis equation shows that the logarithmic delta values are directly proportional to the natural logarithm of the fractionation factors.\n\nNext, we establish the equation for the mass-dependent fractionation line in $\\delta'$-space.
