            "problem": "A closed-system degassing event removes hydrogen from a silicate melt in small increments under constant isotopic fractionation. Let the heavy-to-light isotope ratio of deuterium to protium be denoted by $R \\equiv N_{\\mathrm{D}}/N_{\\mathrm{H}}$, where $N_{\\mathrm{D}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ are the numbers of deuterium and protium atoms, respectively, in the melt.

The definitions of isotopic ratios, the fractionation factor $\\alpha$, and the fraction remaining $f$ are standard. The context of hydrogen isotope fractionation during silicate melt degassing is a well-studied, geochemically relevant process. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary parameters ($R_{0}$, $R$, $\\alpha$) to determine the single unknown variable, $f$, through the governing Rayleigh equation. The setup is self-contained and sufficient for a unique solution.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language and established scientific definitions. There is no subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n4.  **Consistency**: A critical check is the consistency between the direction of isotopic change and the value of $\\alpha$. The given fractionation factor is $\\alpha = 0.9850$, which is less than $1$. This signifies that the product (vapor) is depleted in the heavy isotope (D) relative to the source (melt). Consequently, as degassing progresses and material is removed, the residual melt must become progressively enriched in the heavy isotope. This requires that the final ratio $R$ be greater than the initial ratio $R_{0}$. The provided data are $R = 1.5645 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $R_{0} = 1.5576 \\times 10^{-4}$. Indeed, $R  R_{0}$, which is consistent with the physical process implied by $\\alpha  1$. The data are internally consistent.\n5.  **Realism**: The isotopic ratios are typical for terrestrial D/H systems, and the fractionation factor is a plausible value for hydrogen isotope partitioning between a silicate melt and a water-rich vapor phase at magmatic temperatures.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound, and internally consistent application of the Rayleigh distillation model. A solution can now be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nThe process described is Rayleigh distillation. We start from the fundamental definitions to derive the governing equation. Let $N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{D}}$ be the amounts of the light (protium) and heavy (deuterium) isotopes in the melt reservoir at any time. The isotopic ratio in the melt is $R = N_{\\mathrm{D}}/N_{\\mathrm{H}}$.\n\nConsider an infinitesimal amount of vapor removed from the melt. Let this increment contain $dN_{\\mathrm{H}}$ of the light isotope and $dN_{\\mathrm{D}}$ of the heavy isotope. The isotopic ratio of this infinitesimal product, $R_{\\mathrm{p}}$, is given by the ratio of the amounts removed:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{D}}}{dN_{\\mathrm{H}}}$$\nThe problem states that this product ratio is related to the instantaneous melt ratio $R$ by the constant fractionation factor $\\alpha$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\alpha R$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the ratios, we get:\n$$\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{D}}}{dN_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\alpha \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{D}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}$$\nThis differential equation can be rearranged for integration by separating the variables for the heavy and light isotopes:\n$$\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{D}}}{N_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\alpha \\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial state (with amounts $N_{\\mathrm{H},0}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{D},0}$) to a final state (with amounts $N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{D}}$):\n$$\\int_{N_{\\mathrm{D},0}}^{N_{\\mathrm{D}}} \\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{D}}}{N_{\\mathrm{D}}} = \\alpha \\int_{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}^{N_{\\mathrm{H}}} \\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}$$\nEvaluating the integrals yields:\n$$\\ln(N_{\\mathrm{D}}) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{D},0}) = \\alpha \\left[ \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{H}}) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{H},0}) \\right]$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this becomes:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{D}}}{N_{\\mathrm{D},0}}\\right) = \\alpha \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}\\right) = \\ln\\left[ \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}\\right)^{\\alpha} \\right]$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the relationship between the amounts of each isotope remaining:\n$$\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{D}}}{N_{\\mathrm{D},0}} = \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}\\right)^{\\alpha}$$\nTo express this in terms of the isotopic ratios $R$ and $R_{0}$, we use $N_{\\mathrm{D}} = R N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{D},0} = R_{0} N_{\\mathrm{H},0}$:\n$$\\frac{R N_{\\mathrm{H}}}{R_{0} N_{\\mathrm{H},0}} = \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}\\right)^{\\alpha}$$\nRearranging to solve for the ratio of the isotopic ratios, $R/R_{0}$:\n$$\\frac{R}{R_{0}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}{N_{\\mathrm{H}}} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}\\right)^{\\alpha} = \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}\\right)^{-1} \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}\\right)^{\\alpha} = \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H},0}}\\right)^{\\alpha-1}$$\nThe problem defines the fraction of the light isotope remaining as $f \\equiv N_{\\mathrm{H}}/N_{\\mathrm{H},0}$. Substituting this definition gives the standard form of the Rayleigh distillation equation:\n$$\\frac{R}{R_{0}} = f^{\\alpha-1}$$\nWe need to solve for $f$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{R_{0}}\\right) = (\\alpha-1)\\ln(f)$$\nIsolating $\\ln(f)$:\n$$\\ln(f) = \\frac{\\ln(R/R_{0})}{\\alpha-1}$$\nFinally, we can solve for $f$ by exponentiating:\n$$f = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(R/R_{0})}{\\alpha-1}\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n$R_{0} = 1.5576 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$R = 1.5645 \\times 10^{-4}$\n$\\alpha = 0.9850$\n\nFirst, compute the ratio $R/R_{0}$:\n$$\\frac{R}{R_{0}} = \\frac{1.5645 \\times 10^{-4}}{1.5576 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{1.5645}{1.5576} \\approx 1.004430$$\nNext, compute the term $\\alpha-1$:\n$$\\alpha-1 = 0.9850 - 1 = -0.0150$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(1.5645/1.5576)}{-0.0150}\\right)$$\n$$f \\approx \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(1.004430)}{-0.0150}\\right) \\approx \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.0044202}{-0.0150}\\right) \\approx \\exp(-0.29468)$$\n$$f \\approx 0.74476$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$f \\approx 0.7448$$\nAs a final check on physical bounds, the calculated value $f \\approx 0.7448$ is between $0$ and $1$, which is physically required for a fraction of a remaining species.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **VALID**, and a full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Rayleigh Distillation Equation**\nLet $M_h$ be the amount (e.g., moles) of the heavy isotope and $M_l$ be the amount of the light isotope in the reservoir. The isotopic ratio of the reservoir is $R = M_h/M_l$.\n\nWhen an infinitesimal amount of product is removed from the reservoir, the amounts of the heavy and light isotopes in the reservoir change by $dM_h$ and $dM_l$, respectively. These are negative quantities. The amounts removed are thus $-dM_h$ and $-dM_l$.\n\nThe isotopic ratio of the infinitesimally small parcel of product being removed is, by definition, $R_{\\text{prod}} = \\frac{-dM_h}{-dM_l} = \\frac{dM_h}{dM_l}$.\nThe problem states that $R_{\\text{prod}} = \\alpha R$.

The variable $f$ is defined as the fraction of the *total* reservoir remaining. In most geochemical applications, one isotope (the light one, $M_l$) is far more abundant than the other ($M_h \\ll M_l$). In this common and implicit approximation, a change in the total mass of the reservoir is dominated by the change in the major isotope. Thus, the fraction of the reservoir remaining, $f$, can be accurately approximated by the fraction of the major (light) isotope remaining: $f \\approx M_l/M_{l,0}$.\nUnder this standard approximation, the governing relation is:\n$$\n\\frac{R}{R_0} = f^{\\alpha-1}\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Multiplicative Bias $B$**\nThe derived relation can be solved for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\left(\\frac{R}{R_0}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha-1}}\n$$\nWe define the true fraction remaining, $f_{\\text{true}}$, as the value calculated using all true parameters.

The inferred fraction of the reservoir remaining is only about $37\\%$ of the true fraction. This is a substantial underestimation of $f$. A smaller value of $f$ implies a greater extent of product removal.\nThe source of this error is the overestimation of the initial isotopic ratio ($R_{0,\\text{used}}  R_0$). For $\\alpha  1$, the product is enriched in the heavy isotope, leaving the residual reservoir progressively depleted. The observer, starting from an erroneously high $R_0$, sees the measured present-day ratio $R$ as representing a larger relative drop in isotopic value than has actually occurred. To explain this apparently larger degree of isotopic evolution via the Rayleigh model, a greater extent of fractionation is required. This translates to a smaller calculated fraction remaining ($f_{\\text{inferred}}$).\nConsequently, the interpretation of the strength of the fractionation process is significantly affected. An observer using the incorrect $R_0$ would erroneously conclude that the process (e.g., evaporation, mineral precipitation) has proceeded much further or has been much more efficient than in reality. This highlights the critical sensitivity of Rayleigh distillation models to the assumed initial conditions, an error in which can lead to a gross misinterpretation of the history of the geochemical system.",

Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation and evaluation.\n\nThe core task is to derive the error of the linearized Rayleigh distillation formula and establish a criterion for its use. This requires starting from first principles.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Exact $\\delta$-Rayleigh Equation**\n\nThe process begins with three fundamental relationships:\n1.  The isotopic ratio, $R$, is the ratio of the heavy isotope to the light isotope.\n2.  The $\\delta$-notation expresses this ratio relative to a standard ($R_{std}$):\n    $$ \\delta = \\left( \\frac{R}{R_{std}} - 1 \\right) \\times 1000 $$\n    From this definition, we can express the ratio $R$ as a function of $\\delta$:\n    $$ \\frac{R}{R_{std}} = 1 + \\frac{\\delta}{1000} \\implies R = R_{std} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\delta}{1000} \\right) $$\n    The initial composition, $\\delta_0$, is related to the initial ratio, $R_0$, by the same formula:\n    $$ R_0 = R_{std} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000} \\right) $$\n3.  The Rayleigh distillation law describes the evolution of the isotopic ratio $R$ in the residual reservoir as a function of the fraction remaining, $f$, and the fractionation factor, $\\alpha$:\n    $$ \\frac{R}{R_0} = f^{(\\alpha - 1)} $$\n\nTo derive the exact relationship in $\\delta$-notation, we substitute the expressions for $R$ and $R_0$ into the Rayleigh law:\n$$ \\frac{R_{std} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\delta}{1000} \\right)}{R_{std} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000} \\right)} = f^{(\\alpha - 1)} $$\nThe $R_{std}$ terms cancel, yielding the **exact $\\delta$-Rayleigh equation**:\n$$ \\frac{1 + \\delta/1000}{1 + \\delta_0/1000} = f^{(\\alpha - 1)} $$\nThis can be solved for $\\delta$ to give the explicit form:\n$$ \\delta_{exact} = 1000 \\left[ \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000} \\right) f^{(\\alpha - 1)} - 1 \\right] $$\n\n**2.

Taking the natural logarithm of the exact equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\delta}{1000}\\right) - \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000}\\right) = (\\alpha - 1) \\ln f $$\nUsing the Taylor series expansion $\\ln(1+x) = x - x^2/2 + O(x^3)$, which for small $x$ is approximated as $\\ln(1+x) \\approx x$. If $\\delta/1000$ and $\\delta_0/1000$ are small, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta}{1000} - \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000} \\approx (\\alpha - 1) \\ln f $$\n$$ \\delta - \\delta_0 \\approx 1000 (\\alpha - 1) \\ln f $$\nThis gives the **linearized $\\delta$-Rayleigh approximation**, which we denote as $\\delta_{lin}$:\n$$ \\delta_{lin} = \\delta_0 + 1000 (\\alpha - 1) \\ln f $$\nThe absolute error of this approximation is $E = |\\delta_{exact} - \\delta_{lin}|$. To find an expression for this error, we perform a more careful expansion. Let's return to the explicit form for $\\delta_{exact}$ and expand the term $f^{(\\alpha - 1)} = e^{(\\alpha - 1)\\ln f}$. Let $X = (\\alpha - 1)\\ln f$. The Taylor expansion of $e^X$ is $1 + X + X^2/2! + O(X^3)$.\n$$ \\delta_{exact} = 1000 \\left[ \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000} \\right) \\left( 1 + X + \\frac{X^2}{2} + \\dots \\right) - 1 \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_{exact}}{1000} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000} \\right) \\left( 1 + X + \\frac{X^2}{2} + \\dots \\right) - 1 $$\nExpanding the product:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_{exact}}{1000} = \\left( 1 + X + \\frac{X^2}{2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000} + \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000}X + \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000}\\frac{X^2}{2} \\right) + \\dots - 1 $$\nCollecting terms:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_{exact}}{1000} = \\left( \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000} + X \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\delta_0}{1000}X + \\frac{X^2}{2} \\right) + \\dots $$\nMultiplying by $1000$:\n$$ \\delta_{exact} = \\left( \\delta_0 + 1000 X \\right) + \\left( \\delta_0 X + 500 X^2 \\right) + \\dots $$\nSubstituting $X = (\\alpha - 1)\\ln f$:\n$$ \\delta_{exact} = \\underbrace{\\left( \\delta_0 + 1000 (\\alpha - 1)\\ln f \\right)}_{\\delta_{lin}} + \\underbrace{\\left( \\delta_0 (\\alpha - 1)\\ln f + 500 ((\\alpha - 1)\\ln f)^2 \\right)}_{\\text{Leading-order error term, } \\Delta} + \\dots $$\nThe absolute error $E$ is approximately the absolute value of the leading-order error term:\n$$ E = |\\delta_{exact} - \\delta_{lin}| \\approx |\\Delta| = \\left| \\delta_0 (\\alpha - 1)\\ln f + 500 ((\\alpha - 1)\\ln f)^2 \\right| $$\n\n**3. Establishing a Quantitative Criterion**\n\nTo keep the error $E$ below approximately $1$ per mil, we need to constrain the terms in the error expression. Using the triangle inequality, we can establish an upper bound on the error:\n$$ E \\le |\\delta_0 (\\alpha - 1)\\ln f| + |500 ((\\alpha - 1)\\ln f)^2| $$\nLet $X = (\\alpha-1)\\ln f$. The error bound is $E_{bound} = |\\delta_0 X| + 500X^2$. We want to find conditions on $\\delta_0$ and $X$ such that $E_{bound} \\lesssim 1$.\n\nLet's test the criterion proposed in option A: the linearized approximation is acceptable if both $|\\delta_0| \\le 20$ per mil and $|X| = |(\\alpha-1)\\ln f| \\le 0.02$. The maximum error under these conditions occurs when both $|\\delta_0|$ and $|X|$ are at their maximum allowed values:\n$$ E_{bound, max} = (20)(0.02) + 500(0.02)^2 = 0.4 + 500(0.0004) = 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6 $$\nAn error bound of $0.6$ per mil is well within the tolerance of approximately $1$ per mil. Therefore, the criterion to use the exact formula whenever either $|\\delta_0|  20$ per mil or $|(\\alpha-1)\\ln f|  0.02$ is a sound, mathematically justified guideline to ensure the linearization error remains acceptably small.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Use the exact $\\delta$-Rayleigh formula whenever either $\\lvert \\delta_0 \\rvert  20$ per mil or $\\lvert (\\alpha - 1)\\ln f \\rvert  0.02$. If both $\\lvert \\delta_0 \\rvert \\le 20$ per mil and $\\lvert (\\alpha - 1)\\ln f \\rvert \\le 0.02$, the linearized relation’s absolute error is bounded by about $0.6$ per mil, meeting a $1$ per mil tolerance.**\n    This statement is fully consistent with the derivation above. The proposed bounds on $\\delta_0$ and $(\\alpha - 1)\\ln f$ define a region where the maximum leading-order error is calculated to be $0.6$ per mil, which satisfies the requirement. The logic is sound and the numbers are correct.\n    Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. The linearized $\\delta$-Rayleigh relation is valid provided $f  0.1$ and $\\lvert \\delta_0 \\rvert  500$ per mil, because $\\ln f$ remains moderate and higher-order terms are negligible under these bounds.**\n    This criterion is flawed because it fails to consider the magnitude of the fractionation factor $\\alpha$. Let's test its bounds. Let $f=0.5$, $\\delta_0 = 400$ per mil, and $\\alpha = 1.02$. Then $\\ln f \\approx -0.693$ and $\\alpha-1 = 0.02$.\n    The error is $E \\approx |\\Delta| = |(400)(0.02)(-0.693) + 500((0.02)(-0.693))^2| = |-5.54 + 500(-0.01386)^2| = |-5.54 + 0.096| \\approx 5.4$ per mil. This error is substantial and far from negligible. The proposed bounds are dangerously inadequate.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. The exact $\\delta$-Rayleigh formula is only necessary when $f  0.01$, since the logarithm diverges near zero; for any $f \\ge 0.01$, the linearized relation is effectively exact regardless of $\\alpha$ or $\\delta_0$.**\n    This statement is false. The error depends on $\\delta_0$ and $\\alpha$ in addition to $f$. For $f \\ge 0.01$, one can easily find combinations of $\\delta_0$ and $\\alpha$ that lead to large errors. For example, let $f=0.1$, $\\delta_0=50$ per mil, and $\\alpha=1.04$. Then $\\ln f \\approx -2.30$ and $\\alpha-1 = 0.04$.\n    The error is $E \\approx |\\Delta| = |(50)(0.04)(-2.30) + 500 ((0.04)(-2.30))^2| = |-4.6 + 500(-0.092)^2| = |-4.6 + 4.23| \\approx 0.37$ per mil. This is small.\n    But if $\\alpha = 1.05$, $E \\approx |(50)(0.05)(-2.30) + 500((0.05)(-2.30))^2| = |-5.75 + 500(-0.115)^2| = |-5.75+6.61| \\approx 0.86$ per mil.\n    If $\\delta_0 = 100$ and $\\alpha=1.05$, $E \\approx |-11.5 + 6.61| \\approx 4.89$ per mil. The claim that the relation is \"effectively exact\" is demonstrably false.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. If the initial composition satisfies $\\delta_0 = 0$, the linearized $\\delta$-Rayleigh relation is exact for all $f$ and $\\alpha$, so no special criteria are needed.**\n    This statement implies that if $\\delta_0 = 0$, then $\\delta_{exact} = \\delta_{lin}$.\n    With $\\delta_0=0$, $\\delta_{lin} = 1000(\\alpha-1)\\ln f$.\n    With $\\delta_0=0$, $\\delta_{exact} = 1000(f^{(\\alpha-1)} - 1)$.\n    The claim is that $1000(\\alpha-1)\\ln f = 1000(f^{(\\alpha-1)} - 1)$. Let $u = (\\alpha-1)\\ln f$. The claim reduces to the assertion that $u = e^u - 1$ is an identity for all $u$. This is false. The two sides are equal only at $u=0$. For any non-zero value of $u$, there is a discrepancy. The error when $\\delta_0=0$ is $E \\approx |500((\\alpha-1)\\ln f)^2|$, which is non-zero.\n    Verdict: **Incorrect**.",
