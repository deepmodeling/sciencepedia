The irreversible, rate-limiting catalytic transformation of the substrate-bound complex $SA$ into product $P$ and a regenerated free active site $S$:\n    $$ SA \\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{\\longrightarrow} S + P $$\n    The rate of this reaction, $r$, in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, is assumed to be first-order with respect to the concentration of the substrate-site complex, $[SA]$. The reaction rate is therefore given by the law of mass action:\n    $$ r = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [SA] $$\n    where $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is the turnover frequency in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nTo derive the overall rate expression in terms of measurable solution properties, we must express $[SA]$ as a function of the total site density, activities of dissolved species, and equilibrium constants. This is achieved by applying the principle of site conservation. The total concentration of all surface sites per unit volume, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is constant and is the sum of the concentrations of all possible site forms:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [S] + [SH] + [SA] + [SI] $$\n\nWe can express the concentrations of $[SH]$, $[SA]$, and $[SI]$ in terms of the concentration of the free active site, $[S]$, using the equilibrium expressions:\n-   From the acid-base equilibrium: $[SH] = \\frac{[S] a_{H^+}}{K_a}$\n-   From substrate adsorption: $[SA] = K_A [S] a_A$\n-   From inhibitor adsorption: $[SI] = K_I [S] a_I$\n\nSubstituting these into the site conservation equation:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [S] + \\frac{[S] a_{H^+}}{K_a} + K_A [S] a_A + K_I [S] a_I $$\nWe can factor out $[S]$:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [S] \\left( 1 + \\frac{a_{H^+}}{K_a} + K_A a_A + K_I a_I \\right) $$\nSolving for the concentration of free active sites, $[S]$:\n$$ [S] = \\frac{\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{a_{H^+}}{K_a} + K_A a_A + K_I a_I} $$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[S]$ back into the equation for $[SA]$:\n$$ [SA] = K_A a_A [S] = \\frac{K_A a_A \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{a_{H^+}}{K_a} + K_A a_A + K_I a_I} $$\nThis gives the fractional coverage of the total sites by the substrate, $\\theta_{SA} = \\frac{[SA]}{\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$:\n$$ \\theta_{SA} = \\frac{K_A a_A}{1 + \\frac{a_{H^+}}{K_a} + K_A a_A + K_I a_I} $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $[SA]$ into the rate equation $r = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [SA]$ to obtain the final rate law:\n$$ r = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} K_A a_A \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{a_{H^+}}{K_a} + K_A a_A + K_I a_I} $$\nThe term involving hydrogen ion activity can be expressed using $pH = -\\log_{10}(a_{H^+})$ and $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$, which gives $\\frac{a_{H^+}}{K_a} = \\frac{10^{-pH}}{10^{-pK_a}} = 10^{pK_a - pH}$.

Here, the substrate concentration $[A]$ is represented by its activity $a_A$. The maximum velocity, $V_{\\mathrm{max}}$, is the rate at infinite substrate concentration ($a_A \\to \\infty$), which is $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{M,app}$, is given by:\n$$ K_{M,app} = \\frac{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH} + K_I a_I}{K_A} = \\frac{1}{K_A} \\left( 1 + 10^{pK_a - pH} \\right) + \\frac{K_I}{K_A} a_I $$\nThis form demonstrates that the presence of the inhibitor $I$ and the protonation of sites (represented by the $pH$ term) both increase the apparent Michaelis constant, thereby reducing the apparent affinity of the substrate for the catalytic sites, without altering the theoretical maximum rate. This is the defining characteristic of competitive inhibition.\n\nFor implementation in PHREEQC, the parameters and variables of the derived rate law must be mapped to PHREEQC functions and keywords. A plausible mapping is as follows:\n-   $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ ($\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$): A kinetic parameter, mapped to `PARM(1)`.\n-   $K_A$ ($\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$): A thermodynamic parameter, mapped to `PARM(2)`.\n-   $K_I$ ($\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$): A thermodynamic parameter, mapped to `PARM(3)`.\n-   $pK_a$: A site-specific thermodynamic parameter, mapped to `PARM(4)`.\n-   $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ ($\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$): The total concentration of kinetic sites. In a PHREEQC `RATES` block, this corresponds to the concentration of the kinetic reactant (e.g., `SurfSites`), which is calculated as `M / SOLN_VOL`, where `M` is the moles of the reactant and `SOLN_VOL` is the solution volume in liters. The problem asks to associate $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ directly with `M`, which is a common simplification for systems assuming a $1\\,\\mathrm{L}$ volume.\n-   $a_A$ and $a_I$: Activities of the substrate and inhibitor. As per the problem statement, these are mapped to `TOT(\"A\")` and `TOT(\"I\")` respectively, acknowledging the approximation that molality ($\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{kg}_{\\mathrm{w}}$) is close to molarity ($\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$) and that total concentration is a proxy for activity.\n-   $pH$: The solution $pH$, calculated within PHREEQC using the function `-LA(\"H+\")`.\n\nThe resulting expression for the rate in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for the numerical implementation, assuming activities are equal to molar concentrations ($C_A$, $C_I$), is:\n$$ r(C_A, C_I, pH) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{tot}} K_A C_A}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH} + K_A C_A + K_I C_I} $$\nThis equation is used to compute the rates for the provided test cases.",
