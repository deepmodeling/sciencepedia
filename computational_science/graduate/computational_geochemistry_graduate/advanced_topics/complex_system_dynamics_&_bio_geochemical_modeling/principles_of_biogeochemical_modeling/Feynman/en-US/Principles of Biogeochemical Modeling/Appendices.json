            "problem": "A reactive transport module in a computational geochemistry model predicts mineral dissolution fluxes using temperature-dependent kinetics consistent with thermally activated barrier crossing.

It addresses a fundamental concept in chemical kinetics—the temperature dependence of reaction rates as described by the Arrhenius equation. This principle is a cornerstone of geochemistry, particularly in the context of mineral reaction kinetics and reactive transport modeling. The provided activation energy, $E_a = 60\\,\\text{kJ/mol}$, is a realistic value for silicate mineral dissolution. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($E_a$, $T_1$, $T_2$, $R$) and a clear objective. The assumption of a temperature-independent pre-exponential factor is a standard and acceptable simplification for small temperature ranges, ensuring the problem is self-contained and solvable. The language is objective and precise, using standard scientific terminology. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the intrinsic surface reaction rate constant, $k$, is described by the Arrhenius equation, a postulate of Transition State theory:\n$$k = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)$$\nwhere $A$ is the pre-exponential factor (frequency factor), $E_a$ is the apparent activation energy, $R$ is the molar gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that the observed dissolution rate, $r$, is proportional to this rate constant. Therefore, we can write the rates at an initial temperature $T_1$ and a final temperature $T_2$ as:\n$$r_1 = c \\cdot k_1 = c \\cdot A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_1}\\right)$$\n$$r_2 = c \\cdot k_2 = c \\cdot A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_2}\\right)$$\nHere, $c$ is a proportionality constant that depends on factors such as reactive surface area and solution composition, which are assumed to be constant as temperature changes from $T_1$ to $T_2$.\n\nThe factor $F$ by which the dissolution rate changes is the ratio of the rate at $T_2$ to the rate at $T_1$:\n$$F = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $r_1$ and $r_2$:\n$$F = \\frac{c \\cdot A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_2}\\right)}{c \\cdot A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_1}\\right)}$$\nThe constants $c$ and $A$ cancel, as $A$ is assumed to be temperature-independent. This leaves:\n$$F = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_2}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_1}\\right)}$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{\\exp(x)}{\\exp(y)} = \\exp(x-y)$, we obtain:\n$$F = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_2} - \\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_1}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{RT_1} - \\frac{E_a}{RT_2}\\right)$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{E_a}{R}$ gives the final analytical expression for the factor $F$:\n$$F = \\exp\\left[\\frac{E_a}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right]$$\nThis expression can also be written as:\n$$F = \\exp\\left[\\frac{E_a}{R}\\left(\\frac{T_2 - T_1}{T_1 T_2}\\right)\\right]$$\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the provided values. First, we must ensure all quantities are in consistent SI units.\nThe activation energy is given as $E_a = 60\\,\\text{kJ/mol}$. We convert this to Joules per mole:\n$$E_a = 60\\,\\text{kJ/mol} \\times 1000\\,\\text{J/kJ} = 60000\\,\\text{J/mol}$$\nThe molar gas constant is $R = 8.314462618\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}$.\n\nThe temperatures must be converted from Celsius to Kelvin using the relation $T(\\text{K}) = T(^{\\circ}\\text{C}) + 273.15$:\n$$T_1 = 15 + 273.15 = 288.15\\,\\text{K}$$\n$$T_2 = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15\\,\\text{K}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for $F$:\n$$F = \\exp\\left[\\frac{60000\\,\\text{J/mol}}{8.314462618\\,\\text{J mol}^{-1}\\text{K}^{-1}}\\left(\\frac{1}{288.15\\,\\text{K}} - \\frac{1}{298.15\\,\\text{K}}\\right)\\right]$$\nFirst, we calculate the terms inside the exponent:\nThe term $\\frac{E_a}{R}$ is:\n$$\\frac{E_a}{R} = \\frac{60000}{8.314462618} \\approx 7216.5504\\,\\text{K}$$\nThe term in the parenthesis is:\n$$\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2} = \\frac{1}{288.15\\,\\text{K}} - \\frac{1}{298.15\\,\\text{K}} = \\frac{298.15 - 288.15}{288.15 \\times 298.15}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} = \\frac{10}{85934.3225}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} \\approx 0.000116368\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$$\nThe value of the exponent is the product of these two terms:\n$$\\text{Exponent} \\approx 7216.5504\\,\\text{K} \\times 0.000116368\\,\\text{K}^{-1} \\approx 0.839810$$\nFinally, we calculate $F$:\n$$F = \\exp(0.839810) \\approx 2.31594$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$F \\approx 2.32$$\nThus, an increase in temperature of $10\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ from $15\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ to $25\\,^{\\circ}\\text{C}$ results in the dissolution rate increasing by a factor of approximately $2.32$.",

Thus, the thermodynamic driving force for precipitation is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}} = -RT \\ln S $$\nA more negative $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$ indicates a greater thermodynamic driving force for precipitation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the activity coefficients ($\\gamma_{i}$) for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ using the Davies equation:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{i} = -A z_i^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}} - 0.3 I \\right) $$\nWith $A = 0.509\\,\\mathrm{kg^{1/2}\\,mol^{-1/2}}$, $I = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$, and ion charge magnitude $|z_i| = 2$ for both ions ($z_i^2=4$):\n$$ \\sqrt{I} = \\sqrt{0.05} \\approx 0.2236 $$\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm 2} = - (0.509) (4) \\left( \\frac{0.2236}{1+0.2236} - 0.3 \\times 0.05 \\right) $$\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm 2} = -2.036 \\left( 0.1827 - 0.015 \\right) = -2.036 \\times 0.1677 \\approx -0.3415 $$\n$$ \\gamma_{\\pm 2} = 10^{-0.3415} \\approx 0.4555 $$\nThe activity coefficient is the same for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the activities and the ion activity product ($IAP$):\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} m_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} = (0.4555) \\times (1.0\\times 10^{-3}) = 4.555 \\times 10^{-4} $$\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}} m_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}} = (0.4555) \\times (2.0\\times 10^{-4}) = 9.110 \\times 10^{-5} $$\n$$ IAP = a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} a_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}} = (4.555 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (9.110 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 4.150 \\times 10^{-8} $$\n\nNow, we compute $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$ for each polymorph using $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$ and $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$, so $RT \\approx 2479\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\n**Calcite:**\n$K_{\\mathrm{sp,calcite}} = 3.3\\times 10^{-9}$\n$S_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = \\frac{IAP}{K_{\\mathrm{sp,calcite}}} = \\frac{4.150 \\times 10^{-8}}{3.3 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 12.58$\n$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip,calcite}} = - (2479\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times \\ln(12.58) \\approx - (2479) \\times (2.532) \\approx -6277\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ or $-6.28\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\n**Aragonite:**\n$K_{\\mathrm{sp,aragonite}} = 6.0\\times 10^{-9}$\n$S_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = \\frac{IAP}{K_{\\mathrm{sp,aragonite}}} = \\frac{4.150 \\times 10^{-8}}{6.0 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 6.92$\n$\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip,aragonite}} = - (2479\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times \\ln(6.92) \\approx - (2479) \\times (1.934) \\approx -4794\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ or $-4.79\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n\nSince $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip,calcite}}  \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip,aragonite}}$ (i.e., it is more negative), the precipitation of calcite is thermodynamically more favorable. This is consistent with calcite having a lower solubility product ($K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$), which signifies greater stability of the solid phase.\n\n**2. Kinetic Analysis: Nucleation Barrier ($\\Delta G^{*}$)**\n\nAccording to Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) for homogeneous nucleation of a spherical crystal, the free energy barrier to nucleation is:\n$$ \\Delta G^{*} = \\frac{16 \\pi \\gamma^3 V_m^2}{3 (RT \\ln S)^2} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the interfacial free energy, $V_m$ is the molar volume of the solid, and $RT \\ln S$ is the magnitude of the molar thermodynamic driving force ($-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$). A lower $\\Delta G^{*}$ corresponds to a faster nucleation rate, making the phase kinetically favored.\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar volumes ($V_m$).\n$M_{\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}} = 100.09\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$$ V_{m,\\mathrm{calcite}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{calcite}}} = \\frac{100.09\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}}{2.71\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}} \\approx 36.93\\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,mol^{-1}} = 3.693 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ V_{m,\\mathrm{aragonite}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{aragonite}}} = \\frac{100.09\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}}{2.94\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}} \\approx 34.04\\,\\mathrm{cm^3\\,mol^{-1}} = 3.404 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\nNow, we compute $\\Delta G^{*}$ for each polymorph.\n\n**Calcite:**\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = 0.17\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$\n$V_{m,\\mathrm{calcite}} = 3.693 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$RT \\ln S_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = 6277\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$$ \\Delta G^{*}_{\\mathrm{calcite}} = \\frac{16 \\pi (0.17)^3 (3.693 \\times 10^{-5})^2}{3 (6277)^2} \\approx \\frac{3.37 \\times 10^{-10}}{1.18 \\times 10^{8}} \\approx 2.85 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\n\n**Aragonite:**\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$\n$V_{m,\\mathrm{aragonite}} = 3.404 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$RT \\ln S_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = 4794\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$$ \\Delta G^{*}_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} = \\frac{16 \\pi (0.12)^3 (3.404 \\times 10^{-5})^2}{3 (4794)^2} \\approx \\frac{1.01 \\times 10^{-10}}{6.90 \\times 10^{7}} \\approx 1.46 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\n\nComparing the nucleation barriers: $\\Delta G^{*}_{\\mathrm{aragonite}}  \\Delta G^{*}_{\\mathrm{calcite}}$. The nucleation barrier for aragonite is significantly lower. This is primarily because $\\Delta G^{*}$ is proportional to $\\gamma^3$, and aragonite has a substantially lower interfacial free energy. This kinetic advantage outweighs calcite's larger thermodynamic driving force. Therefore, aragonite is kinetically favored to nucleate first and may persist as a metastable phase.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. Calcite has a more negative $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$ and is therefore thermodynamically favored; however, aragonite can persist metastably because its lower interfacial free energy yields a smaller $\\Delta G^{*}$ under these conditions.**\n    -   Our calculations show $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip,calcite}} \\approx -6.28\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip,aragonite}} \\approx -4.79\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. Calcite does indeed have a more negative $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$ and is thermodynamically favored.\n    -   Our calculations also show $\\Delta G^{*}_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} \\approx 1.46 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$ and $\\Delta G^{*}_{\\mathrm{calcite}} \\approx 2.85 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{J}$. Aragonite has a smaller nucleation barrier, largely due to its lower interfacial free energy ($\\gamma$), making it kinetically favored to nucleate and persist as a metastable phase.\n    -   This statement is fully consistent with our derivations.\n    -   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. Aragonite has a more negative $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$ because its solubility product is lower, so it is thermodynamically favored; calcite persists metastably because it experiences higher supersaturation.**\n    -   \"Aragonite has a more negative $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$... so it is thermodynamically favored\": This is incorrect. Calcite's $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$ is more negative.\n    -   \"...because its solubility product is lower\": This is factually incorrect from the given data ($K_{\\mathrm{sp,aragonite}}  K_{\\mathrm{sp,calcite}}$).\n    -   The rest of the statement is also flawed.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. Both polymorphs have equal $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$ because they share the same chemical formula; whichever phase first nucleates will persist, independent of interfacial properties.**\n    -   \"Both polymorphs have equal $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$\": This is incorrect. As polymorphs, they have different crystal structures and thus different thermodynamic properties, including $K_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{precip}}$. Our calculations confirm they are different.\n    -   \"...independent of interfacial properties\": This is incorrect. The nucleation barrier $\\Delta G^{*}$ and thus the nucleation rate are strongly dependent on interfacial free energy $\\gamma$.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Calcite is both thermodynamically and kinetically favored under the given conditions, implying aragonite cannot nucleate at any appreciable rate and will not persist.**\n    -   \"Calcite is both thermodynamically and kinetically favored\": This is incorrect. While calcite is thermodynamically favored, our calculations show it is kinetically disfavored (higher $\\Delta G^{*}$) compared to aragonite.\n    -   The implication that aragonite will not nucleate is therefore also incorrect.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nThe analysis unequivocally supports option A.",
