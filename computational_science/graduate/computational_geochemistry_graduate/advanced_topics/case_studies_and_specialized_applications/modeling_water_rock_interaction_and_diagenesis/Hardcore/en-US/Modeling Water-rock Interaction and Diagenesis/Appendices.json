            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data and conditions for a complete solution are provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for the Reaction Affinity, $A$, from fundamental thermodynamic principles. The Gibbs energy of reaction, $\\Delta_rG$, for a general chemical reaction $\\sum_i \\nu_i X_i = 0$ is defined as the sum of the chemical potentials, $\\mu_i$, of the reactants and products, weighted by their stoichiometric coefficients, $\\nu_i$ (positive for products, negative for reactants):\n$$ \\Delta_rG = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i $$\nThe chemical potential of a species $i$ is related to its standard-state chemical potential, $\\mu_i^\\circ$, and its activity, $a_i$, by the expression:\n$$ \\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln(a_i) $$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu_i$ into the equation for $\\Delta_rG$:\n$$ \\Delta_rG = \\sum_i \\nu_i (\\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln(a_i)) = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\sum_i \\nu_i \\ln(a_i) $$\nThe term $\\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i^\\circ$ is the standard Gibbs energy of reaction, $\\Delta_rG^\\circ$. The term $\\sum_i \\nu_i \\ln(a_i)$ can be rewritten using the properties of logarithms as $\\ln(\\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i})$. The product $\\prod_i a_i^{\\nu_i}$ is the definition of the reaction quotient, $Q$.\nThus, the expression for $\\Delta_rG$ becomes:\n$$ \\Delta_rG = \\Delta_rG^\\circ + RT \\ln(Q) $$\nAt chemical equilibrium, the Gibbs energy of reaction is zero ($\\Delta_rG = 0$) and the reaction quotient is equal to the equilibrium constant, $K$. Therefore:\n$$ 0 = \\Delta_rG^\\circ + RT \\ln(K) \\implies \\Delta_rG^\\circ = -RT \\ln(K) $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta_rG^\\circ$ back into the equation for $\\Delta_rG$:\n$$ \\Delta_rG = -RT \\ln(K) + RT \\ln(Q) = RT (\\ln(Q) - \\ln(K)) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{K}\\right) $$\nThe Reaction Affinity, $A$, is defined as the negative of the molar Gibbs energy of reaction, $A = -\\Delta_rG$.

It is based on the Arrhenius model of chemical kinetics, which is derived from statistical mechanics (specifically, the Boltzmann distribution) and the concept of an activation energy barrier. This is a fundamental and universally accepted principle in physical chemistry and geochemistry. The provided parameters for albite ($E_a$, $\\rho$, $M$) are physically realistic and consistent with experimental values found in geological literature. The temperatures represent a plausible burial diagenesis scenario. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information, clear definitions, and a logical set of tasks that lead to a unique solution. The simplifying assumptions (planar geometry, far-from-equilibrium kinetics) are standard for creating tractable models of complex geochemical processes and do not invalidate the problem's scientific basis. The problem statement is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Rate Constant Temperature Dependence**\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the fraction of molecular systems possessing sufficient energy to overcome a molar activation barrier $E_a$. In a system at thermal equilibrium at absolute temperature $T$, the probability $P(E)$ of a system having an energy $E$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution, $P(E) \\propto \\exp(-E/k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. For a molar quantity, this is expressed using the molar activation energy $E_a$ and the universal gas constant $R = N_A k_B$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant. The fraction of systems with energy greater than or equal to $E_a$ is proportional to the term $\\exp(-E_a/RT)$.\n\nThe dissolution rate constant, $k(T)$, is therefore proportional to this probability factor. The constant of proportionality, known as the pre-exponential factor $k_0$, consolidates terms related to the attempt frequency of the reaction and steric (orientational) factors. This leads to the Arrhenius equation:\n$$\nk(T) = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation provides the functional dependence of $k(T)$ on $T$.\n\nTo find the ratio of the rate constants at two different temperatures, $T_1$ and $T_2$, we write the expression for each:\n$$\nk(T_1) = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk(T_2) = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_2}\\right)\n$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)}$ is then:\n$$\n\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)} = \\frac{k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_2}\\right)}{k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_1}\\right)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_2} - \\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_1}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the exponent, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the Multiplicative Rate Change**\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of this ratio using the provided parameters. We will use the value $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n- $E_a = 35\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = 35000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $T_1 = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_2 = 353\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe exponent is:\n$$\n\\frac{E_a}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) = \\frac{35000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}\\left(\\frac{1}{298\\,\\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{353\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\approx 4209.8\\,\\mathrm{K} \\left(0.0033557\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}} - 0.0028329\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}\\right) \\approx 4209.8\\,\\mathrm{K} \\left(0.0005228\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}}\\right) \\approx 2.201\n$$\nThe multiplicative change in the dissolution rate is:\n$$\n\\frac{k(T_2)}{k(T_1)} = \\exp(2.201) \\approx 9.03\n$$\nThus, increasing the temperature from $298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $353\\,\\mathrm{K}$ increases the dissolution rate by approximately a factor of $9$.\n\n**Task 3: Determination of the Dissolution Timescale**\n\nThe problem states that under far-from-equilibrium conditions, the dissolution flux (moles per unit area per unit time), denoted $J$, is equal to the rate constant $k(T)$. At the burial temperature $T_2$, the flux is $J = k(T_2)$.\nWe must first calculate $k(T_2)$:\n$$\nk(T_2) = k_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_2}\\right) = (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{35000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}} \\times 353\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nk(T_2) \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{35000}{2935.0}\\right) \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\exp(-11.925)\n$$\n$$\nk(T_2) \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (6.623 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 6.623 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nThis molar flux $J$ causes the albite layer to recede.

For $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the charges are $z_{\\mathrm{Na^{+}}}=+1$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}}=-1$, respectively. The square of the charge is identical for both ions: $z_{\\mathrm{Na^{+}}}^{2} = (+1)^2 = 1$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}}^{2} = (-1)^2 = 1$.\nTherefore, according to the Davies equation, their activity coefficients are equal: $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na^{+}}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}}$. Consequently, $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na^{+}}} = \\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Cl^{-}}}$. Let's denote this common value by $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm}$.\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm} = -A(1)^2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}-0.3\\,I\\right) = -A\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}-0.3\\,I\\right)\n$$\nThe error $\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}$ can now be written as:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{SI} = -2\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm} = -2\\left[-A\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}-0.3\\,I\\right)\\right] = 2A\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}-0.3\\,I\\right)\n$$\nWe need to calculate the values of $\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}$ for $I=0.10$ and $I=1.00$. Let's define the function $f(I) = \\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}-0.3\\,I$.\nFor $I=1.00$:\n$$\nf(1.00) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1.00}}{1+\\sqrt{1.00}}-0.3(1.00) = \\frac{1}{2} - 0.3 = 0.2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}_{1.00} = 2A \\cdot f(1.00) = 2(0.509)(0.2) = 0.2036\n$$\nFor $I=0.10$:\n$$\nf(0.10) = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.10}}{1+\\sqrt{0.10}}-0.3(0.10) \\approx \\frac{0.3162277}{1+0.3162277} - 0.03 \\approx 0.240253 - 0.03 = 0.210253\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}_{0.10} = 2A \\cdot f(0.10) = 2(0.509)(0.210253) \\approx 0.2140376\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$ of the absolute magnitude of the error at $I=1.00$ to that at $I=0.10$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{|\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}_{1.00}|}{|\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}_{0.10}|}\n$$\nSince both $f(1.00)$ and $f(0.10)$ are positive, the errors $\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}_{1.00}$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}_{0.10}$ are also positive. The absolute value signs can be removed.\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}_{1.00}}{\\Delta \\mathrm{SI}_{0.10}} = \\frac{2A \\cdot f(1.00)}{2A \\cdot f(0.10)} = \\frac{f(1.00)}{f(0.10)}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $f(I)$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{0.2}{0.210253\\dots} \\approx 0.951234\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.9512$.",
