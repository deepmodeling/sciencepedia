            "solution": "The problem of determining the molar volume of a supercritical fluid from its pressure and temperature is a fundamental task in computational geochemistry and chemical engineering. It is a well-posed problem grounded in established principles of thermodynamics. The use of the Peng–Robinson cubic equation of state and the Newton–Raphson numerical method for its solution is a standard and robust approach. The problem provides all necessary data and definitions for a unique and meaningful solution. It is scientifically sound, objective, and complete. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the molar volume $v$ that satisfies the Peng–Robinson equation of state for a given target pressure $P_{\\mathrm{target}}$ and temperature $T$. The equation is:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{PR}}(v; T) = \\frac{R T}{v - b} - \\frac{a \\alpha(T)}{v^2 + 2 b v - b^2}\n$$\nWe must solve the equation $P_{\\mathrm{PR}}(v; T) = P_{\\mathrm{target}}$ for $v$. This is a root-finding problem for the residual function $f(v)$:\n$$\nf(v) = P_{\\mathrm{PR}}(v; T) - P_{\\mathrm{target}} = \\frac{R T}{v - b} - \\frac{a \\alpha(T)}{v^2 + 2 b v - b^2} - P_{\\mathrm{target}} = 0\n$$\n\nThe Newton–Raphson method is an iterative procedure for finding the roots of a differentiable function. The iteration is defined as:\n$$\nv_{k+1} = v_k - \\frac{f(v_k)}{f'(v_k)}\n$$\nwhere $v_k$ is the estimate of the root at iteration $k$, and $f'(v_k)$ is the derivative of the residual function with respect to volume, evaluated at $v_k$. A crucial first step is to derive an analytical expression for this derivative.\n\nThe residual function is:\n$$\nf(v) = R T (v - b)^{-1} - a \\alpha(T) (v^2 + 2 b v - b^2)^{-1} - P_{\\mathrm{target}}\n$$\nWe differentiate $f(v)$ with respect to $v$, treating $T$, $R$, $a$, $b$, $\\alpha(T)$, and $P_{\\mathrm{target}}$ as constants. Using the power rule and the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$\nf'(v) = \\frac{d f}{d v} = \\frac{d}{d v} \\left( R T (v - b)^{-1} \\right) - \\frac{d}{d v} \\left( a \\alpha(T) (v^2 + 2 b v - b^2)^{-1} \\right) - \\frac{d}{d v} \\left( P_{\\mathrm{target}} \\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of the first term is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d v} \\left( R T (v - b)^{-1} \\right) = R T \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (v - b)^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{d v}(v-b) = - \\frac{R T}{(v - b)^2}\n$$\nThe derivative of the second term is:\n$$\n- \\frac{d}{d v} \\left( a \\alpha(T) (v^2 + 2 b v - b^2)^{-1} \\right) = - a \\alpha(T) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (v^2 + 2 b v - b^2)^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{d v}(v^2 + 2 b v - b^2)\n$$\nThe derivative of the polynomial in the denominator is $\\frac{d}{d v}(v^2 + 2 b v - b^2) = 2v + 2b = 2(v+b)$. Substituting this back gives:\n$$\n+ \\frac{a \\alpha(T) \\cdot 2(v+b)}{(v^2 + 2 b v - b^2)^2}\n$$\nThe derivative of the constant $P_{\\mathrm{target}}$ is $0$. Combining the terms, the complete analytical expression for the derivative $f'(v)$ is:\n$$\nf'(v) = - \\frac{R T}{(v - b)^2} + \\frac{2 a \\alpha(T) (v + b)}{(v^2 + 2 b v - b^2)^2}\n$$\n\nThe algorithmic procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Calculate substance parameters for CO₂**: Using the provided critical temperature $T_c = 304.1282 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, critical pressure $P_c = 7.3773 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, acentric factor $\\omega = 0.22394$, and the universal gas constant $R = 8.314462618 \\ \\mathrm{J/(mol \\cdot K)}$, we compute the substance-specific Peng–Robinson parameters $a$ and $b$, and the parameter $\\kappa$ for the temperature correction factor $\\alpha(T)$.\n    $$\n    a = 0.45724 \\frac{R^2 T_c^2}{P_c}\n    $$\n    $$\n    b = 0.07780 \\frac{R T_c}{P_c}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\kappa = 0.37464 + 1.54226 \\, \\omega - 0.26992 \\, \\omega^2\n    $$\n2.  **For each $(T, P)$ case**:\n    a.  Calculate the temperature-dependent term $\\alpha(T) = \\left[1 + \\kappa \\left(1 - \\sqrt{T/T_c}\\right)\\right]^2$.\n    b.  **Initial Guess**: A physically sound initial guess $v_0$ is the molar volume predicted by the ideal gas law, $v_0 = RT/P_{\\mathrm{target}}$. This guess is excellent for low pressures and remains reasonable at higher pressures.\n    c.  **Newton–Raphson Iteration**:\n        i.  Initialize the iteration with $v_k = v_0$.\n        ii. Loop until convergence:\n            1.  Calculate the residual $f(v_k)$ and its derivative $f'(v_k)$ using the derived expressions.\n            2.  Compute the update step $\\Delta v = -f(v_k) / f'(v_k)$.\n            3.  Calculate the new estimate $v_{k+1} = v_k + \\Delta v$.\n            4.  **Safeguard**: The molar volume $v$ must be greater than the excluded volume parameter $b$. If an iteration produces $v_{k+1} \\le b$, the step is too aggressive. In this case, the step size is reduced by a damping factor (e.g., repeatedly halving $\\Delta v$) until the new estimate $v_{k+1} = v_k + \\Delta v$ becomes physically valid (i.e., $v_{k+1} > b$).\n            5.  **Convergence Check**: The iteration is considered converged when the relative change in volume is smaller than a specified tolerance $\\epsilon$. We require convergence to at least $10$ significant digits, so a tolerance of $|\\Delta v / v_{k+1}|  10^{-12}$ is appropriate.\n            6.  Update $v_k \\leftarrow v_{k+1}$ and continue the loop.\n        iii. A maximum number of iterations (e.g., $50$) is imposed to prevent infinite loops in case of non-convergence.\n3.  **Output**: The converged molar volume $v$ for each $(T, P)$ case is collected and formatted as specified. All calculations are performed using SI units.\n\nThis procedure systematically combines the physical model (Peng–Robinson EOS) with a robust numerical method (damped Newton–Raphson) to solve for the molar volume under various conditions, adhering to all scientific and algorithmic constraints of the problem.",

The fluid flows at constant interstitial velocity $U$ along the fracture of length $L$, and molecular diffusion and dispersion are negligible compared to advection. Density and porosity may be taken as constant. The concentration field of a representative reactive scalar $C(x,t)$ obeys one-dimensional advection-reaction dynamics along the flow direction.\n\nStarting from conservation of mass for the dissolved reactive scalar and the given kinetic assumption, construct the steady, one-dimensional advection-reaction balance, non-dimensionalize the equation using the characteristic length $L$ and characteristic velocity $U$, and identify the single dimensionless group that compares the characteristic time of chemical reaction with the characteristic time of advection across the fracture length. Evaluate this dimensionless group for the following conditions representative of scCO$_2$-bearing brine at elevated conditions: temperature $T = 333$ K, pressure $P = 12$ MPa (these thermodynamic conditions are provided for context; they do not directly enter the calculation), $k = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$, $U = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ m s$^{-1}$, and $L = 0.75$ m.\n\nBased on the magnitude of this dimensionless group, assess whether dissolution is predominantly reaction-controlled or transport-controlled under these conditions, and justify your assessment from the non-dimensional balance.\n\nReport your final numerical value for the dimensionless group, rounded to three significant figures. No units are required for the reported number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and analysis of a one-dimensional, steady-state advection-reaction model for mineral dissolution in a fracture. The final goal is to calculate a dimensionless number that characterizes the system and use it to determine the rate-controlling regime.\n\nThe first step is to establish the governing equation from the principle of mass conservation for the dissolved reactive scalar, whose concentration is denoted by $C(x,t)$. The one-dimensional conservation equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = R $$\nwhere $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate along the fracture, $J$ is the flux of the scalar, and $R$ is the net rate of production (source/sink term) per unit volume of fluid.\n\nThe problem states that molecular diffusion and dispersion are negligible compared to advection. Therefore, the flux $J$ is purely advective:\n$$ J = U C $$\nwhere $U$ is the constant interstitial fluid velocity.\n\nThe reaction is the dissolution of a reactive mineral, which adds the scalar to the fluid. The rate is described by a pseudo-first-order law in the reactive driving force. The driving force for dissolution is the difference between the equilibrium concentration, $C_{eq}$, and the local concentration, $C$. The source term $R$ is thus proportional to this driving force:\n$$ R = k(C_{eq} - C) $$\nHere, $k$ is the effective rate constant with units of inverse time (s$^{-1}$). This formulation is consistent with dissolution: if the fluid is undersaturated ($C  C_{eq}$), then $R  0$, and the concentration tends to increase.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $J$ and $R$ into the conservation equation, and noting that $U$ is constant, we obtain the one-dimensional advection-reaction equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} = k(C_{eq} - C) $$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state balance, which is achieved when the concentration field no longer changes with time, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = 0$. The governing equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ U \\frac{dC}{dx} = k(C_{eq} - C) $$\nNext, we non-dimensionalize this equation. The problem specifies the characteristic length $L$ (the fracture length) and characteristic velocity $U$. We define a dimensionless position variable $x'$:\n$$ x' = \\frac{x}{L} $$\nTo define a dimensionless concentration, we normalize the concentration change relative to the total possible change. Let the concentration at the fracture inlet ($x=0$) be $C_{in}$. The concentration $C$ will vary between $C_{in}$ and $C_{eq}$. We define a dimensionless concentration $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{C - C_{in}}{C_{eq} - C_{in}} $$\nFrom these definitions, we find the derivatives and terms needed for substitution:\n$$ C = C_{in} + \\theta (C_{eq} - C_{in}) \\implies \\frac{dC}{dx} = (C_{eq} - C_{in}) \\frac{d\\theta}{dx} $$\nUsing the chain rule, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dx'} \\frac{dx'}{dx} = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{d\\theta}{dx'}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{C_{eq} - C_{in}}{L} \\frac{d\\theta}{dx'} $$\nThe reaction term can also be expressed in terms of $\\theta$:\n$$ k(C_{eq} - C) = k(C_{eq} - (C_{in} + \\theta (C_{eq} - C_{in}))) = k(1 - \\theta)(C_{eq} - C_{in}) $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the steady-state ODE:\n$$ U \\left( \\frac{C_{eq} - C_{in}}{L} \\frac{d\\theta}{dx'} \\right) = k(1 - \\theta)(C_{eq} - C_{in}) $$\nAssuming a non-zero driving force ($C_{eq} \\neq C_{in}$), we can divide both sides by $(C_{eq} - C_{in})$:\n$$ \\frac{U}{L} \\frac{d\\theta}{dx'} = k(1 - \\theta) $$\nRearranging this equation to group the parameters yields the final non-dimensional form:\n$$ \\frac{d\\theta}{dx'} = \\left( \\frac{kL}{U} \\right) (1 - \\theta) $$\nThe single dimensionless group that appears is $\\frac{kL}{U}$. This group is the Damköhler number, commonly denoted as $Da$. It compares the characteristic time of advection ($ \\tau_{adv} = L/U $) with the characteristic time of reaction ($ \\tau_{react} = 1/k $):\n$$ Da = \\frac{kL}{U} = \\frac{L/U}{1/k} = \\frac{\\tau_{adv}}{\\tau_{react}} $$\nThis is precisely the group that \"compares the characteristic time of chemical reaction with the characteristic time of advection across the fracture length\".\n\nNow, we evaluate this dimensionless group using the provided values:\n- $k = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ s$^{-1}$\n- $U = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ m s$^{-1}$\n- $L = 0.75$ m\n\n$$ Da = \\frac{(2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ s}^{-1}) (0.75 \\text{ m})}{3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ m s}^{-1}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 0.75}{3.0} = \\frac{1.875}{3.0} = 0.625 $$\nThe value of the dimensionless group is $0.625$.\n\nFinally, we assess the controlling regime based on the magnitude of the Damköhler number.\n- If $Da \\gg 1$, then $\\tau_{adv} \\gg \\tau_{react}$. The reaction is much faster than transport. The system would quickly reach chemical equilibrium ($C \\to C_{eq}$, or $\\theta \\to 1$). The overall rate of dissolution would be limited by the rate at which advection transports undersaturated fluid into the fracture. This is the **transport-controlled** regime.\n- If $Da \\ll 1$, then $\\tau_{adv} \\ll \\tau_{react}$. The transport is much faster than the reaction. The fluid resides in the fracture for a time too short for the reaction to proceed significantly toward equilibrium. The overall rate of dissolution is limited by the slow chemical kinetics. This is the **reaction-controlled** regime.\n\nOur calculated value is $Da = 0.625$. Since $Da  1$, the characteristic time for advection ($L/U$) is shorter than the characteristic time for reaction ($1/k$). This indicates that the chemical kinetics are the slower, rate-limiting process. Therefore, the dissolution is predominantly **reaction-controlled**.\n\nThis conclusion is justified by the non-dimensional balance $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx'} = Da(1-\\theta)$. With $Da = 0.625$, the dimensionless concentration gradient $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx'}$ is of a magnitude less than $1$ (near the inlet where $1-\\theta \\approx 1$). This implies a gradual increase in concentration along the fracture, rather than a sharp front characteristic of a transport-limited system. The extent of reaction over the fracture length $L$ is limited by the rate constant $k$, not the fluid velocity $U$.\n\nThe final requested value is the dimensionless group, rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.625$ already has three significant figures.",
