Extraction of Givens**\n\n*   **Geometry:** A two-dimensional domain with longitudinal coordinate $x$ and transverse coordinate $y$. The medium is composed of a periodic repetition of alternating layers of equal thickness $\\ell_m$. The period in the $y$-direction is $2\\ell_m$.\n*   **Physical Properties:** The local molecular diffusivity $D(y)$ is piecewise constant, alternating between $D_1$ and $D_2$ in adjacent layers.\n*   **Transport Process:** A dissolved, non-advected species with concentration $c(x,y,t)$ undergoes diffusion and a uniform first-order reaction with rate constant $k$.\n*   **Microscale Equations:**\n    *   Conservation Equation: $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\left( D(y) \\nabla c \\right) - k\\,c$\n    *   Microscopic Flux (Fick's Law): $\\mathbf{j}(x,y,t) = -D(y)\\,\\nabla c$\n*   **Upscaling Assumption (Transverse Mixing):**\n    *   Transverse diffusion is sufficiently rapid that $c(x,y,t)$ is uniform in $y$ for each $x$ on the timescale of interest, implying $\\partial c/\\partial y \\approx 0$ in the upscaled description.\n    *   A direct consequence is that at any fixed $x$, the longitudinal gradient $\\partial c/\\partial x$ is independent of $y$.\n*   **Upscaled Model Definitions:**\n    *   **Averaging Operator:** $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the $y$-average over one periodic unit of width $2\\ell_m$.\n    *   **Average Concentration:** $\\langle c \\rangle(x,t)$\n    *   **Average Flux:** $J(x,t) = \\langle j_x(x,y,t) \\rangle$, where $j_x$ is the longitudinal component of the microscopic flux $\\mathbf{j}$.\n    *   **Effective Constitutive Relation:** $J(x,t) = -D^{\\ast}\\,\\frac{\\partial \\langle c \\rangle}{\\partial x}$, defining the effective diffusion coefficient $D^{\\ast}$.\n*   **Objective:** Derive the expression for $D^{\\ast}$ in terms of $D_1$ and $D_2$.\n\n**1.2. Validation Analysis**\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on the well-established principles of Fickian diffusion and reaction kinetics. The method of volume averaging to derive effective parameters for heterogeneous media is a standard and rigorous technique in transport phenomena, hydrogeology, and computational geochemistry. The problem is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a clear microscale model, a specific upscaling assumption, and a well-defined objective. The \"transverse mixing\" assumption simplifies the problem to a tractable, well-posed state, representing a valid and important limiting case in transport theory (analogous to the limit where transverse equilibration is much faster than longitudinal transport).\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n*   **Consistency and Completeness:** The problem is self-contained. The key assumption provided—that $\\partial c/\\partial x$ is independent of $y$—is sufficient to proceed with the derivation. The presence of the reaction term with rate constant $k$ does not create a contradiction or an incompleteness, as the effective diffusivity $D^{\\ast}$ is a constitutive property of the medium relating flux to the concentration gradient, which is independent of reaction source/sink terms. The derivation will show that $k$ does not affect $D^{\\ast}$. The parameter $\\ell_m$ is part of the problem description and will be used in the derivation, though it may cancel out of the final result.\n\n**1.3. Verdict**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem in the upscaling of transport parameters, suitable for a rigorous derivation.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Effective Diffusion Coefficient\n\nThe objective is to find the effective diffusion coefficient $D^{\\ast}$, which is defined by the upscaled constitutive relation for the average longitudinal flux $J(x,t)$:\n$$\nJ(x,t) = -D^{\\ast}\\,\\frac{\\partial \\langle c \\rangle}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe average flux $J(x,t)$ is the spatial average of the microscopic longitudinal flux, $j_x(x,y,t)$, over the Representative Elementary Volume (REV). The REV is one periodic unit of width $2\\ell_m$.\n$$\nJ(x,t) = \\langle j_x(x,y,t) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\int_{0}^{2\\ell_m} j_x(x,y,t) \\, dy\n$$\nThe microscopic longitudinal flux $j_x$ is given by Fick's law:\n$$\nj_x(x,y,t) = -D(y) \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the average flux gives:\n$$\nJ(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\int_{0}^{2\\ell_m} \\left( -D(y) \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right) \\, dy = \\left\\langle -D(y) \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe problem states a critical consequence of the transverse mixing assumption: \"at any fixed $x$, the longitudinal gradient $\\partial c/\\partial x$ is independent of $y$.\" This allows us to treat the term $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ as a constant with respect to the integration variable $y$. Therefore, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nJ(x,t) = -\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\int_{0}^{2\\ell_m} D(y) \\, dy \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\langle D(y) \\rangle\n$$\nNext, we must relate the microscopic gradient $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ to the gradient of the average concentration, $\\frac{\\partial \\langle c \\rangle}{\\partial x}$. The average concentration is defined as:\n$$\n\\langle c \\rangle(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\int_{0}^{2\\ell_m} c(x,y,t) \\, dy\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$ and applying the Leibniz integral rule (since the limits of integration are constant with respect to $x$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\langle c \\rangle}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\int_{0}^{2\\ell_m} c(x,y,t) \\, dy \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\int_{0}^{2\\ell_m} \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}(x,y,t) \\, dy = \\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nAgain using the fact that $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}$ is independent of $y$, its average over $y$ is simply itself:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nTherefore, we have established the equality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\langle c \\rangle}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into our expression for the average flux $J(x,t)$:\n$$\nJ(x,t) = -\\frac{\\partial \\langle c \\rangle}{\\partial x} \\langle D(y) \\rangle\n$$\nBy comparing this derived expression for $J(x,t)$ with the definition of the effective diffusion coefficient, $J(x,t) = -D^{\\ast}\\,\\frac{\\partial \\langle c \\rangle}{\\partial x}$, we can directly identify $D^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n-D^{\\ast}\\,\\frac{\\partial \\langle c \\rangle}{\\partial x} = -\\langle D(y) \\rangle \\frac{\\partial \\langle c \\rangle}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThis leads to the conclusion that the effective diffusion coefficient is the arithmetic average of the microscopic diffusivity over the REV.\n$$\nD^{\\ast} = \\langle D(y) \\rangle\n$$\nThe final step is to calculate this average. The medium consists of alternating layers of equal thickness $\\ell_m$. Within one period of width $2\\ell_m$, there is a layer of thickness $\\ell_m$ with diffusivity $D_1$ and an adjacent layer of thickness $\\ell_m$ with diffusivity $D_2$.\n$$\nD(y) =\n\\begin{cases}\nD_1  \\text{for } 0 \\le y  \\ell_m \\\\\nD_2  \\text{for } \\ell_m \\le y  2\\ell_m\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe average is calculated as:\n$$\nD^{\\ast} = \\langle D(y) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\int_{0}^{2\\ell_m} D(y) \\, dy = \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\ell_m} D_1 \\, dy + \\int_{\\ell_m}^{2\\ell_m} D_2 \\, dy \\right)\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\nD^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\left( D_1 [y]_{0}^{\\ell_m} + D_2 [y]_{\\ell_m}^{2\\ell_m} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\left( D_1 \\ell_m + D_2 (2\\ell_m - \\ell_m) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nD^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2\\ell_m} \\left( D_1 \\ell_m + D_2 \\ell_m \\right) = \\frac{\\ell_m (D_1 + D_2)}{2\\ell_m}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression, we arrive at the final result:\n$$\nD^{\\ast} = \\frac{D_1 + D_2}{2}\n$$\nThis result, the arithmetic mean of the diffusivities, is the classic result for effective transport parallel to the layering of a stratified medium. The reaction rate $k$ does not appear in the result, as expected. The layer thickness $\\ell_m$ cancels out because the layers are of equal thickness.",

A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe conservation of mass for species $A$ and $B$ in regions $1$ and $2$ is described by the following system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$ \\frac{d c_{A,1}}{dt} = -k c_{A,1} c_{B,1} + \\lambda (c_{A,2} - c_{A,1}) $$\n$$ \\frac{d c_{A,2}}{dt} = -k c_{A,2} c_{B,2} + \\lambda (c_{A,1} - c_{A,2}) $$\n$$ \\frac{d c_{B,1}}{dt} = -k c_{A,1} c_{B,1} + \\lambda (c_{B,2} - c_{B,1}) $$\n$$ \\frac{d c_{B,2}}{dt} = -k c_{A,2} c_{B,2} + \\lambda (c_{B,1} - c_{B,2}) $$\nThe initial conditions are $c_{A,1}(0) = C_0$, $c_{A,2}(0) = 0$, $c_{B,1}(0) = 0$, and $c_{B,2}(0) = C_0$.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the governing equations and the initial conditions, it can be shown that $c_{A,1}(t) = c_{B,2}(t)$ and $c_{A,2}(t) = c_{B,1}(t)$ for all $t \\ge 0$. Let us define $c_1(t) \\equiv c_{A,1}(t) = c_{B,2}(t)$ and $c_2(t) \\equiv c_{A,2}(t) = c_{B,1}(t)$. The system of four ODEs simplifies to two:\n$$ \\frac{dc_1}{dt} = -k c_1 c_2 + \\lambda(c_2 - c_1) $$\n$$ \\frac{dc_2}{dt} = -k c_1 c_2 + \\lambda(c_1 - c_2) $$\nwith initial conditions $c_1(0) = C_0$ and $c_2(0) = 0$.\n\nThe mean concentrations are identical: $\\overline{c_A}(t) = \\overline{c_B}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(c_1(t) + c_2(t))$. The mean reaction rate is $R_{\\text{mean}}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}k(c_{A,1}c_{B,1} + c_{A,2}c_{B,2}) = \\frac{1}{2}k(c_1 c_2 + c_2 c_1) = k c_1 c_2$.\nThe definition of the effective rate coefficient gives $k c_1 c_2 = k_{\\text{eff}} \\left( \\frac{c_1+c_2}{2} \\right)^2$.\nSolving for $k_{\\text{eff}}$ yields $k_{\\text{eff}}(t) = k \\frac{4c_1 c_2}{(c_1+c_2)^2}$.\nThe bias $\\Delta k$ is then:\n$$ \\Delta k(t) = k_{\\text{eff}}(t) - k = k \\left( \\frac{4c_1 c_2}{(c_1+c_2)^2} - 1 \\right) = -k \\frac{(c_1-c_2)^2}{(c_1+c_2)^2} $$\n\nTo analyze the system, we introduce sum and difference variables, $S(t) = c_1(t)+c_2(t)$ and $D(t) = c_1(t)-c_2(t)$. The ODEs for $S$ and $D$ are:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = \\frac{dc_1}{dt} + \\frac{dc_2}{dt} = -2k c_1 c_2 = - \\frac{k}{2}(S^2 - D^2) $$\n$$ \\frac{dD}{dt} = \\frac{dc_1}{dt} - \\frac{dc_2}{dt} = -2\\lambda(c_1-c_2) = -2\\lambda D $$\nThe initial conditions are $S(0) = C_0$ and $D(0) = C_0$.\nThe equation for $D(t)$ is readily solved: $D(t) = C_0 \\exp(-2\\lambda t)$.\nThe bias can be written as $\\Delta k(t) = -k \\frac{D(t)^2}{S(t)^2}$.\n\nLet's non-dimensionalize the system using $\\tau = \\lambda t$, $\\hat{c}(\\tau) = c(t)/C_0$, and $Da = kC_0/\\lambda$.\nThe dimensionless difference is $\\hat{D}(\\tau) = D(t)/C_0 = \\exp(-2\\tau)$.\nThe dimensionless sum $\\hat{S}(\\tau) = S(t)/C_0$ follows the Riccati equation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\hat{S}}{d\\tau} = -\\frac{Da}{2}(\\hat{S}^2 - \\hat{D}^2) = -\\frac{Da}{2}(\\hat{S}^2 - \\exp(-4\\tau)) $$\nwith $\\hat{S}(0)=1$. The bias is $\\Delta k(\\tau) = -k \\frac{\\hat{D}(\\tau)^2}{\\hat{S}(\\tau)^2} = -k \\frac{\\exp(-4\\tau)}{\\hat{S}(\\tau)^2}$.\n\nWe must evaluate $\\Delta k$ at $\\tau_*$, the time of maximum mean reaction rate.\n$R_{\\text{mean}}(\\tau) = k c_1 c_2 = k C_0^2 \\hat{c}_1 \\hat{c}_2 = \\frac{k C_0^2}{4}(\\hat{S}^2 - \\hat{D}^2) = \\frac{k C_0^2}{4}(\\hat{S}(\\tau)^2 - \\exp(-4\\tau))$.\nTo find the maximum, we set its derivative with respect to $\\tau$ to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dR_{\\text{mean}}}{d\\tau} = \\frac{k C_0^2}{4} \\left( 2\\hat{S}\\frac{d\\hat{S}}{d\\tau} + 4\\exp(-4\\tau) \\right) = 0 $$\nSubstitute the expression for $d\\hat{S}/d\\tau$:\n$$ 2\\hat{S}\\left(-\\frac{Da}{2}(\\hat{S}^2 - \\exp(-4\\tau))\\right) + 4\\exp(-4\\tau) = 0 $$\nAt $\\tau = \\tau_*$, this gives:\n$$ -Da\\,\\hat{S}(\\tau_*)(\\hat{S}(\\tau_*)^2 - \\exp(-4\\tau_*)) + 4\\exp(-4\\tau_*) = 0 $$\n$$ Da\\,\\hat{S}(\\tau_*)^3 = (Da\\,\\hat{S}(\\tau_*) + 4)\\exp(-4\\tau_*) $$\nFrom this condition, we can express $\\exp(-4\\tau_*)$:\n$$ \\exp(-4\\tau_*) = \\frac{Da\\,\\hat{S}(\\tau_*)^3}{Da\\,\\hat{S}(\\tau_*) + 4} $$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for the bias at $\\tau=\\tau_*$:\n$$ \\Delta k(\\tau_*) = -k \\frac{\\exp(-4\\tau_*)}{\\hat{S}(\\tau_*)^2} = -k \\frac{1}{\\hat{S}(\\tau_*)^2} \\left( \\frac{Da\\,\\hat{S}(\\tau_*)^3}{Da\\,\\hat{S}(\\tau_*) + 4} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta k(\\tau_*) = -k \\frac{Da\\,\\hat{S}(\\tau_*)}{Da\\,\\hat{S}(\\tau_*) + 4} $$\nThis expression still depends on the unknown value $\\hat{S}(\\tau_*)$, which requires solving the Riccati equation. To obtain the requested leading-order analytical expression, an approximation is necessary.\n\nThe problem states $Da = O(1)$, precluding an asymptotic expansion in $Da$. The most physically meaningful approximation is to consider the state of the system at the time of maximum reaction rate. This maximum occurs at the point of optimal balance between the mixing process, which brings reactants together, and the reaction process, which consumes them. At this specific time $\\tau_*$, we posit that the overall depletion of total reactants is not yet substantial.\nThis is formalized by the leading-order approximation $\\hat{S}(\\tau_*) \\approx 1$.\nThis approximation assumes that at the instant the rate peaks, the total dimensionless concentration of reactants, $\\hat{S} = (c_A+c_B)_{avg}/C_0$, is still close to its initial value of $1$. The justification lies in viewing the peak rate time as characteristic of the initial mixing-limited phase, before significant global reactant consumption has occurred. The validity of this approximation is bolstered by checking the resulting expression in limiting cases: for slow reaction ($Da \\to 0$), the bias correctly goes to zero (well-mixed limit), and for fast reaction ($Da \\to \\infty$), the bias correctly approaches $-k$ (fully segregated, mixing-limited limit). An expression that correctly interpolates between these physical limits is a strong candidate for the required leading-order result when $Da = O(1)$.\n\nApplying the approximation $\\hat{S}(\\tau_*) \\approx 1$ to the derived expression for the bias, we get:\n$$ \\Delta k(\\tau_*) \\approx -k \\frac{Da \\cdot (1)}{Da \\cdot (1) + 4} $$\n$$ \\Delta k(\\tau_*) \\approx -k \\frac{Da}{Da + 4} $$\nThis is the desired leading-order analytical expression for the bias in the effective rate coefficient, evaluated at the time of maximum mean reaction rate, as a function of $Da$ and $k$.",

For physical realism, ensure $\\phi$ remains strictly between $0$ and $1$ by clipping to a small interval $(\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon)$ with $\\varepsilon = 10^{-6}$ whenever necessary.\n- Effective diffusivity scaling with porosity via a Bruggeman-type relation: $D_{\\mathrm{e}} = D_{\\mathrm{m}} \\, \\phi^{\\beta}$, where $D_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the molecular diffusion coefficient and $\\beta$ is a constant exponent.\n- Specific reactive surface area scaling with porosity: the bulk specific reactive surface area per bulk volume is $a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) = a_{\\mathrm{s0}} \\, (\\phi/\\phi_{0})^{\\eta}$, where $a_{\\mathrm{s0}}$ is the specific reactive surface area at the reference porosity $\\phi_{0}$ and $\\eta$ is a given constant. The total reactive surface area inside the REV is then $S_{\\mathrm{tot}} = a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) \\, V_{\\mathrm{REV}}$.\n\nPore-scale model and upscaling:\n- Consider a set of $N$ pore classes indexed by $i = 1,\\dots,N$. For each class $i$, a quasi-one-dimensional film of thickness $l_{i}$ separates the bulk concentration $c_{\\mathrm{b}}$ (assumed uniform at the pore mouth) from the reactive surface at which the local concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{s},i}$. At steady state, the flux to the surface equals the reaction rate at the surface. Each class $i$ is assigned an area weighting factor $w_{i}$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} = 1$, and the reactive surface area of class $i$ is $S_{i} = w_{i} \\, S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n- The upscaled volumetric reaction rate is defined as\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{up}} \\equiv \\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{REV}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} j_{i} \\, S_{i},\n$$\nwith $j_{i}$ the steady diffusive flux density to class $i$.\n\nRequired derivation and algorithm design (do not provide shortcut formulas in the problem statement): Starting from the stated fundamental laws, derive the steady-state flux $j_{i}$ for each pore class by enforcing Fick's law over the film of thickness $l_{i}$ and the equality of diffusive flux to the surface reaction rate at $x = l_{i}$. Use the poroelastic porosity update to compute $\\phi$, then compute $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ from the Bruggeman-type relation, and $a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi)$ from the given scaling law. Use area weighting to aggregate pore-scale fluxes and obtain $R_{\\mathrm{up}}$.\n\nScientific realism requirements:\n- All variables are defined as follows, with required units in parentheses:\n  - $D_{\\mathrm{m}}$ (m$^{2}$/s), $\\phi_{0}$ (dimensionless), $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}}$ (dimensionless), $\\beta$ (dimensionless), $a_{\\mathrm{s0}}$ (m$^{2}$/m$^{3}$), $\\eta$ (dimensionless), $V_{\\mathrm{REV}}$ (m$^{3}$), $c_{\\mathrm{b}}$ (mol/m$^{3}$).\n  - For each $i$: $l_{i}$ (m), $k_{\\mathrm{s},i}$ (m/s), $w_{i}$ (dimensionless with $\\sum w_{i} = 1$).\n- The final upscaled rate $R_{\\mathrm{up}}$ must be reported in mol/(m$^{3}$ s).\n\nTest suite:\nImplement a single program that computes $R_{\\mathrm{up}}$ for each of the following three parameter sets, and outputs the three results in the required format. For the constants common to all three cases, use:\n- $D_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1 \\times 10^{-9}$ m$^{2}$/s,\n- $\\phi_{0} = 0.2$,\n- $\\beta = 1.5$,\n- $a_{\\mathrm{s0}} = 1 \\times 10^{5}$ m$^{2}$/m$^{3}$,\n- $\\eta = 0.2$,\n- $V_{\\mathrm{REV}} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}$ m$^{3}$,\n- $c_{\\mathrm{b}} = 1.0$ mol/m$^{3}$.\n\nNow compute $R_{\\mathrm{up}}$ for these three cases:\n1) Happy-path, mixed control:\n- $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}} = +0.05$,\n- $N = 3$,\n- $l = [1 \\times 10^{-4}, \\; 5 \\times 10^{-5}, \\; 2 \\times 10^{-4}]$ m,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{s}} = [1 \\times 10^{-5}, \\; 5 \\times 10^{-6}, \\; 2 \\times 10^{-5}]$ m/s,\n- $w = [0.5, \\; 0.3, \\; 0.2]$.\n\n2) Transport-limited tendency (compression reduces diffusivity):\n- $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}} = -0.03$,\n- $N = 2$,\n- $l = [5 \\times 10^{-4}, \\; 2 \\times 10^{-4}]$ m,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{s}} = [1 \\times 10^{-3}, \\; 2 \\times 10^{-3}]$ m/s,\n- $w = [0.6, \\; 0.4]$.\n\n3) Reaction-limited tendency (very slow kinetics):\n- $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}} = +0.02$,\n- $N = 4$,\n- $l = [1 \\times 10^{-3}, \\; 8 \\times 10^{-4}, \\; 6 \\times 10^{-4}, \\; 1 \\times 10^{-4}]$ m,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{s}} = [1 \\times 10^{-7}, \\; 5 \\times 10^{-8}, \\; 2 \\times 10^{-7}, \\; 1 \\times 10^{-7}]$ m/s,\n- $w = [0.25, \\; 0.25, \\; 0.25, \\; 0.25]$.\n\nAngle units are not applicable.

Report each $R_{\\mathrm{up}}$ in mol/(m$^{3}$ s).\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the three results as a comma-separated list of floats in scientific notation with eight significant digits, enclosed in square brackets, for example: \"[1.23456789e-03,2.34567891e+00,3.45678912e-05]\". The results must be in mol/(m$^{3}$ s).",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of reactive transport and poroelasticity, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data and definitions, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The provided parameters and conditions are physically realistic.\n\nThe objective is to compute an upscaled volumetric reaction rate, $R_{\\mathrm{up}}$, for a reactive porous medium. This requires integrating pore-scale transport and reaction phenomena over a Representative Elementary Volume (REV), while accounting for the geomechanical influence of volumetric strain $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}}$ on porosity $\\phi$ and, consequently, on transport properties and reactive surface area.\n\nThe solution is derived in the following steps:\n1.  Derivation of the steady-state solute flux for a single pore class.\n2.  Formulation of the upscaled reaction rate by aggregating the contributions from all pore classes.\n3.  Specification of the complete computational algorithm, including the geomechanical coupling.\n\n**Step 1: Pore-Scale Steady-State Flux**\n\nWe consider a single pore class, indexed by $i$, characterized by a stagnant film of thickness $l_i$. A solute diffuses from the bulk pore fluid, where the concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{b}}$, across this film to a reactive mineral surface, where the concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{s},i}$.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the one-dimensional steady-state diffusive flux density, $j_i$, is constant across the film and is given by:\n$$\nj_i = -D_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{dc}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is the effective diffusivity in the porous medium. The concentration profile is linear across the film, so the gradient can be approximated as $\\frac{\\Delta c}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{s},i} - c_{\\mathrm{b}}}{l_i}$. The flux towards the surface is therefore:\n$$\nj_i = -D_{\\mathrm{e}} \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{s},i} - c_{\\mathrm{b}}}{l_i} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{e}}}{l_i} (c_{\\mathrm{b}} - c_{\\mathrm{s},i})\n$$\n\nAt the mineral surface ($x=l_i$), the rate of consumption by the surface reaction, per unit of reactive surface area, is given by a linear kinetic law:\n$$\nr_i = k_{\\mathrm{s},i} c_{\\mathrm{s},i}\n$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{s},i}$ is the first-order surface reaction rate constant for class $i$.\n\nAt steady state, the flux of solute arriving at the surface must equal the rate at which it is consumed. This establishes the mass balance condition at the surface:\n$$\nj_i = r_i\n$$\nCombining the expressions for flux and reaction rate, we have a system of two equations for the two unknowns, $j_i$ and $c_{\\mathrm{s},i}$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nj_i = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{e}}}{l_i} (c_{\\mathrm{b}} - c_{\\mathrm{s},i}) \\\\\nj_i = k_{\\mathrm{s},i} c_{\\mathrm{s},i}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom the second equation, we express the surface concentration in terms of the flux: $c_{\\mathrm{s},i} = j_i / k_{\\mathrm{s},i}$. Substituting this into the first equation eliminates $c_{\\mathrm{s},i}$:\n$$\nj_i = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{e}}}{l_i} \\left(c_{\\mathrm{b}} - \\frac{j_i}{k_{\\mathrm{s},i}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $j_i$:\n$$\nj_i = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{e}} c_{\\mathrm{b}}}{l_i} - \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{e}} j_i}{l_i k_{\\mathrm{s},i}}\n$$\n$$\nj_i \\left(1 + \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{e}}}{l_i k_{\\mathrm{s},i}}\\right) = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{e}} c_{\\mathrm{b}}}{l_i}\n$$\n$$\nj_i \\left(\\frac{l_i k_{\\mathrm{s},i} + D_{\\mathrm{e}}}{l_i k_{\\mathrm{s},i}}\\right) = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{e}} c_{\\mathrm{b}}}{l_i}\n$$\n$$\nj_i = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{e}} k_{\\mathrm{s},i} c_{\\mathrm{b}}}{l_i k_{\\mathrm{s},i} + D_{\\mathrm{e}}}\n$$\nThis expression can be elegantly rewritten by dividing the numerator and denominator by $D_{\\mathrm{e}} k_{\\mathrm{s},i}$:\n$$\nj_i = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\frac{l_i}{D_{\\mathrm{e}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{s},i}}}\n$$\nThis form shows that the overall process is governed by two resistances in series: a transport resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{transport}, i} = l_i/D_{\\mathrm{e}}$, and a reaction resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{reaction}, i} = 1/k_{\\mathrm{s},i}$.\n\n**Step 2: Upscaling to the REV Scale**\n\nThe upscaled volumetric reaction rate, $R_{\\mathrm{up}}$, is defined as the total molar reaction rate within the REV, normalized by the volume of the REV, $V_{\\mathrm{REV}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{up}} \\equiv \\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{REV}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\text{total rate in class } i)\n$$\nThe total rate in class $i$ is the product of the flux density $j_i$ and the total surface area of that class, $S_i$. Thus,\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{up}} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{REV}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} j_i S_i\n$$\nThe area $S_i$ is given as a fraction $w_i$ of the total reactive surface area $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ in the REV: $S_i = w_i S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The total area $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is related to the bulk specific reactive surface area $a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi)$ by $S_{\\mathrm{tot}} = a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) V_{\\mathrm{REV}}$. Substituting these relations:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{up}} = \\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{REV}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} j_i (w_i S_{\\mathrm{tot}}) = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{V_{\\mathrm{REV}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i j_i = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) V_{\\mathrm{REV}}}{V_{\\mathrm{REV}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i j_i\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{up}} = a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i j_i\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $j_i$, the final formula for the upscaled rate is:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{up}} = a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i \\left( \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{b}}}{\\frac{l_i}{D_{\\mathrm{e}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{s},i}}} \\right)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $R_{\\mathrm{up}}$ is an average of the pore-scale fluxes, weighted by their respective surface area fractions and scaled by the bulk specific reactive surface area.\n\n**Step 3: Geomechanical Coupling and Computational Algorithm**\n\nThe model's parameters $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi)$ depend on the porosity $\\phi$, which in turn is affected by the volumetric strain $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}}$.\n\n1.  **Porosity Update**: The porosity $\\phi$ is updated from its reference value $\\phi_0$ based on the volumetric strain $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}}$ using the small-strain poroelastic relation:\n    $$\n    \\phi = \\phi_{0} + (1 - \\phi_{0}) \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}}\n    $$\n    For physical realism, the computed $\\phi$ is clipped to the interval $(\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon)$, where $\\varepsilon = 10^{-6}$.\n\n2.  **Effective Diffusivity**: The effective diffusivity $D_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is calculated from the updated porosity $\\phi$ using the Bruggeman-type relation:\n    $$\n    D_{\\mathrm{e}} = D_{\\mathrm{m}} \\phi^{\\beta}\n    $$\n    where $D_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the molecular diffusion coefficient and $\\beta$ is a cementation exponent.\n\n3.  **Specific Surface Area**: The bulk specific reactive surface area $a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi)$ is also updated based on the new porosity:\n    $$\n    a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) = a_{\\mathrm{s0}} \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_{0}}\\right)^{\\eta}\n    $$\n    where $a_{\\mathrm{s0}}$ is the reference specific surface area at $\\phi_0$ and $\\eta$ is a scaling exponent.\n\n**Complete Algorithm:**\nFor each given parameter set, the calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  Calculate the updated porosity $\\phi = \\phi_{0} + (1 - \\phi_{0}) \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{v}}$, and clip it to $(\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon)$.\n2.  Using the updated $\\phi$, calculate $D_{\\mathrm{e}} = D_{\\mathrm{m}} \\phi^{\\beta}$.\n3.  Using the updated $\\phi$, calculate $a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) = a_{\\mathrm{s0}} (\\phi/\\phi_{0})^{\\eta}$.\n4.  For each pore class $i=1, \\dots, N$:\n    a. Calculate the flux $j_i = c_{\\mathrm{b}} / (\\frac{l_i}{D_{\\mathrm{e}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{s},i}})$.\n5.  Calculate the final upscaled volumetric rate $R_{\\mathrm{up}} = a_{\\mathrm{s}}(\\phi) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i j_i$.\n6.  Report the result in mol/(m$^3$ s) with the specified precision.",
