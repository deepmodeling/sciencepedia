It is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe theoretical framework for this problem is linear chemo-poroelasticity. The total volumetric strain, $\\Delta \\epsilon_v$, is decomposed into an elastic component, $\\Delta \\epsilon_v^e$, and a chemical component arising from cation exchange, $\\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}}$. This chemical strain is treated as an eigenstrain.\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\epsilon_v = \\Delta \\epsilon_v^e + \\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}}\n$$\n\nThe elastic volumetric strain, $\\Delta \\epsilon_v^e$, is related to the change in mean effective stress, $\\Delta \\sigma'_{\\text{mean}}$, through the drained bulk modulus of the porous skeleton, $K$.\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\epsilon_v^e = \\frac{1}{K} \\Delta \\sigma'_{\\text{mean}}\n$$\n\nThe change in mean effective stress is defined by Terzaghi's principle as modified by Biot:\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\sigma'_{\\text{mean}} = \\Delta \\sigma_{\\text{mean}} - b \\Delta p\n$$\n\nHere, $\\Delta \\sigma_{\\text{mean}}$ is the change in the mean total stress, $\\Delta p$ is the change in pore fluid pressure, and $b$ is the Biot coefficient.\n\nCombining these constitutive relations, we can express the total volumetric strain as:\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\epsilon_v = \\frac{1}{K}(\\Delta \\sigma_{\\text{mean}} - b \\Delta p) + \\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}}\n$$\n\nNow, we apply the specific boundary conditions given in the problem statement.\n1.  **\"Constant confining stress with no change in external mean stress\"**: This implies that the change in the mean total stress applied to the specimen is zero.\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\sigma_{\\text{mean}} = 0\n    $$\n2.  **\"A rigid, fluid-tight triaxial cell\"**: The term \"rigid\" implies that the boundaries of the cell are fixed and do not deform. Since the specimen fills the cell, its total volume must remain constant. This is an isochoric (constant volume) condition, which means the total volumetric strain is zero.\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\epsilon_v = 0\n    $$\n\nSubstituting these two conditions ($\\Delta \\sigma_{\\text{mean}} = 0$ and $\\Delta \\epsilon_v = 0$) into the constitutive equation for total volumetric strain yields:\n\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{K}(0 - b \\Delta p) + \\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}}\n$$\n\nThis equation simplifies to:\n\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{b}{K} \\Delta p + \\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}}\n$$\n\nRearranging this equation provides the first required result: the relation between the pore pressure rise $\\Delta p$ and the volumetric chemical strain $\\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}}$.\n\n$$\n\\frac{b}{K} \\Delta p = \\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}} \\implies \\Delta p = \\frac{K}{b} \\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}}\n$$\n\nThis relation demonstrates that under undrained, isochoric conditions with constant total stress, the induced pore pressure is directly proportional to the chemical swelling strain. The term $K/b$ acts as a coupling modulus.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the numerical value of the pore pressure rise, $\\Delta p$. First, we calculate the volumetric chemical strain, $\\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}}$, using the provided linear relationship and cation exchange data.\n\nThe change in the fraction of exchange sites occupied by calcium is:\n$$\n\\Delta X_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = X_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{f} - X_{\\mathrm{Ca}}^{0} = 0.2 - 0 = 0.2\n$$\n\nThe resulting volumetric chemical strain is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}} = \\alpha_{c}\\,\\Delta X_{\\mathrm{Ca}} = (0.015)(0.2) = 0.003\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the pore pressure rise, $\\Delta p$. We are given the material properties:\n- Drained bulk modulus: $K = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 2.5 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n- Biot coefficient: $b = 0.85$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived relation:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{K}{b} \\Delta \\epsilon^{\\mathrm{chem}} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{0.85} \\times 0.003\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{7.5}{0.85}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 8.823529... \\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta p \\approx 8.824\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and porous media flow, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is stated in objective, formal language. The provided physical parameters are realistic for the described scenario.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps: first, the derivation of the diffusion equation for pore pressure $p$ and the identification of the hydraulic diffusivity $c$; second, the definition of the characteristic diffusion timescale $t_d$ through dimensional reasoning; and third, the numerical evaluation of $t_d$ for the given parameters in the reacted state.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the Diffusion Equation and Hydraulic Diffusivity\n\nThe conservation of fluid mass in a one-dimensional, deforming porous medium, assuming constant fluid density, is described by the continuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\zeta}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $\\zeta$ is the increment of fluid content per unit reference volume, $t$ is time, $q$ is the specific discharge, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate.\n\nThe problem provides the following constitutive laws:\n1.

Darcy's law for one-dimensional flow:\n$$ q = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} $$\nwhere $k$ is the intrinsic permeability and $\\mu$ is the fluid viscosity.\n\nSubstituting these two laws into the continuity equation gives the general governing equation for pore pressure:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (M p)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\right) \\implies \\frac{\\partial (M p)}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\right) $$\nThe problem specifies that a diffusion-type equation emerges at the macroscopic scale. This implies a simplification of the general equation to the canonical form of the diffusion equation. This form is obtained by assuming that the material properties $k$ and $M$, and the fluid property $\\mu$, are uniform in space for the purpose of analyzing pressure diffusion. Furthermore, we assume that the timescale for changes in $M$ and $k$ due to reaction is much longer than the timescale of pressure diffusion, allowing us to treat $M$ as a constant with respect to the time derivative. Under these standard assumptions, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ M \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} $$\nRearranging this equation into the standard form of a one-dimensional diffusion equation, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = c \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2}$, yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\left(\\frac{k}{\\mu M}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} $$\nBy comparing this with the canonical form, the hydraulic diffusivity $c$ is identified as:\n$$ c = \\frac{k}{\\mu M} $$\n\nStep 2: Definition of the Characteristic Diffusion Timescale\n\nThe diffusion equation governs how pressure disturbances propagate through the medium. The characteristic time it takes for such a disturbance to travel across a characteristic length can be determined by dimensional analysis. The hydraulic diffusivity $c$ has units of length squared per time, $[c] = L^2 T^{-1}$. The problem specifies a characteristic length scale, the layer thickness $L$. The only combination of $c$ and $L$ that yields a quantity with the unit of time is $L^2/c$.
