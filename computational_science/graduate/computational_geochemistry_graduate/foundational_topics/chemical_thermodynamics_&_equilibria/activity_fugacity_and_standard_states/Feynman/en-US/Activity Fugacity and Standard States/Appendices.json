            "solution": "The problem asks for a two-part analysis of the Debye–Hückel theory for a $1{:}1$ electrolyte in aqueous solution at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. First, an explanation from first principles for the theory's breakdown at high ionic strength. Second, a quantitative determination of the ionic strength range over which the Debye–Hückel limiting law (DHLL) is valid, defined as having a relative error in the mean molal activity coefficient, $\\gamma_{\\pm}$, of less than $10\\,\\%$.\n\n**Part 1: Theoretical Basis and Breakdown of the Debye–Hückel Model**\n\nThe Debye–Hückel theory aims to calculate the activity coefficient, which accounts for the deviation of an electrolyte solution from ideal behavior due to electrostatic interactions between ions. The model is built upon a set of core assumptions and approximations:\n1.  **Point Ions:** The ions are treated as point charges, meaning they have no volume. Their distribution around a central ion is governed solely by electrostatics and thermal motion.\n2.  **Continuum Solvent:** The solvent (water) is treated as a structureless dielectric continuum with a constant bulk relative permittivity, $\\epsilon_r$. This ignores the molecular nature of the solvent and any specific ion-solvent interactions.\n3.  **Linearized Poisson-Boltzmann Equation:** The electrostatic potential $\\psi(r)$ around a central ion is described by the Poisson–Boltzmann equation (PBE). The DH theory uses a linearized version of the PBE, which is valid only when the electrostatic potential energy of an ion in the field is much smaller than its thermal energy, i.e., $|z_i e \\psi| \\ll k_B T$, where $z_i$ is the ion charge number, $e$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nFrom these assumptions, the DHLL is derived, which gives the following expression for the mean molal activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ of an electrolyte with cation charge $z_+$ and anion charge $z_-$:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = -A |z_+ z_-| \\sqrt{I} $$\nwhere $I$ is the ionic strength in $\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$ and $A$ is a constant dependent on the solvent and temperature. For water at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ ($298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$), $A \\approx 0.509\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{1/2}\\mathrm{mol}^{-1/2}$.\n\nThe breakdown of the Debye–Hückel approach as ionic strength $I$ increases, particularly into the regime $I  1\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$, stems directly from the failure of its fundamental assumptions:\n\n1.  **Failure of the Point-Ion Approximation:** As concentration increases, the average distance between ions decreases. A key parameter in the theory is the Debye screening length, $\\kappa^{-1}$, which characterizes the thickness of the ionic atmosphere and the effective range of electrostatic interactions. It is given by $\\kappa^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 k_B T}{2 N_A e^2 \\rho_s I}\\right)^{1/2}$, where $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $N_A$ is Avogadro's number, and $\\rho_s$ is the solvent density. For water at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, this simplifies to $\\kappa^{-1} \\approx 0.304/\\sqrt{I}\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ (with $I$ in $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, which is approximately $\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$ for dilute aqueous solutions). At $I = 1\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$, $\\kappa^{-1} \\approx 0.3\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. This distance is comparable to or even smaller than the physical radii of hydrated ions (e.g., hydrated radius of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ is $\\sim 0.36\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$ is $\\sim 0.33\\,\\mathrm{nm}$). Treating ions as points is no longer tenable; their finite size and the resulting hard-core repulsion become significant.\n\n2.  **Failure of the PBE Linearization:** The condition $|z_i e \\psi| \\ll k_B T$ is violated at higher concentrations. The potential $\\psi$ near an ion becomes larger as the concentration of counter-ions in its vicinity increases. This means the exponential term in the PBE can no longer be accurately approximated by a linear expansion, leading to substantial errors in the calculated potential and, consequently, the activity coefficient.\n\n3.  **Failure of the Continuum Solvent Model:** At high ion concentrations, the electric fields near ions are strong enough to order and immobilize nearby water dipoles, creating hydration shells. This leads to:\n    *   **Dielectric Decrement:** The effective dielectric permittivity near the ions is lower than the bulk value, a phenomenon not captured by the model.\n    *   **Solvent availability:** A significant fraction of water molecules become \"bound\" in solvation shells and are no longer part of the bulk solvent, which affects the true molality of the ions.\n\n4.  **Neglect of Specific Interactions:** The DH theory only considers long-range, non-specific electrostatic forces. At higher concentrations, short-range forces like van der Waals interactions and specific chemical interactions, such as ion pairing (formation of M$^+$X$^-$ entities), become increasingly important and contribute to the deviation from ideality.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Analysis**\n\nWe will now quantitatively compare the DHLL predictions with the given experimental data. For a $1{:}1$ electrolyte, $|z_+ z_-| = 1$, so the DHLL is $\\gamma_{\\pm}^{\\mathrm{DHLL}} = 10^{-A \\sqrt{I}}$. Using $A = 0.509\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{1/2}\\mathrm{mol}^{-1/2}$, we calculate $\\gamma_{\\pm}^{\\mathrm{DHLL}}$ and the relative error, $\\text{Err}_{\\text{rel}} = |\\gamma_{\\pm}^{\\mathrm{DHLL}} - \\gamma_{\\pm}^{\\mathrm{exp}}| / \\gamma_{\\pm}^{\\mathrm{exp}}$.\n\n*   For $I = 0.005\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$:\n    $\\gamma_{\\pm}^{\\mathrm{DHLL}} = 10^{-0.509 \\sqrt{0.005}} \\approx 10^{-0.0360} \\approx 0.920$.\n    $\\gamma_{\\pm}^{\\mathrm{exp}} = 0.97$.\n    $\\text{Err}_{\\text{rel}} = |0.920 - 0.97|/0.97 \\approx 0.0515$ or $5.2\\%$.

The upper limit for validity is therefore in the range between these two values. A reasonable estimate for the cutoff is $I \\approx 0.01$ to $0.02\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Debye–Hückel is quantitatively valid up to $I \\approx 0.01$ to $0.02\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$ for $1{:}1$ electrolytes; at higher $I$ the Debye screening length becomes comparable to ionic diameters, the linearization of the PBE fails, and dielectric decrement and short-range specific interactions (including ion pairing) cause large deviations.**\n    This option provides a quantitative range ($I \\approx 0.01$ to $0.02\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$) that is consistent with our calculations. The physical explanation for the breakdown is comprehensive and correct, mentioning the failure of the point-ion approximation (Debye length vs. ionic diameter), the failure of the linearized PBE, and the neglect of other real-world effects like dielectric decrement and specific interactions.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Debye–Hückel remains quantitatively accurate up to $I \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$, because stronger screening at higher $I$ weakens interionic forces and thus improves the validity of the PBE linearization.**\n    The quantitative claim is false; our calculation shows a $\\sim 59\\%$ error at $I = 1\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$. The reasoning is also incorrect; higher concentration and stronger screening exacerbate the conditions under which the PBE linearization fails, they do not improve its validity.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Debye–Hückel is only valid at vanishing ionic strength $I  10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$; at any finite $I$ the model fails because the infinite dilution standard state is inappropriate.**\n    The quantitative claim is far too strict. Our calculations show validity with $ 10\\%$ error at concentrations up to $I = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$, which is much larger than $10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$. The reasoning regarding the standard state is a misunderstanding; the standard state is a reference point and does not become \"inappropriate.\" The model fails to predict the *deviation* from the standard state, not because of the standard state itself.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Debye–Hückel becomes more accurate for $2{:}1$ electrolytes than for $1{:}1$ electrolytes at $I  1\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$, because larger charge numbers yield shorter Debye lengths and therefore reduced nonideality.**\n    This statement is physically incorrect. The magnitude of non-ideality in the DHLL is proportional to $|z_+ z_-|$, which is $2$ for a $2{:}1$ electrolyte versus $1$ for a $1{:}1$ electrolyte. The DH model predicts, and experiments confirm, that deviations from ideality are *more* severe for higher-valence electrolytes at the same ionic strength. The theory fails earlier and more severely for multivalent ions.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. The extended Debye–Hückel equation with an ion-size parameter reproduces $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ within $5\\,\\%$ up to $I \\approx 2\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$ for typical $1{:}1$ electrolytes, so the limiting assumptions remain adequate well into the concentrated regime.**\n    This option incorrectly discusses the *extended* DH equation. Furthermore, its claim of $5\\%$ accuracy up to $I = 2\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,kg^{-1}}$ is factually incorrect for any standard form of the extended DH equation. At such high concentrations, models like Pitzer's are required. Finally, the conclusion that the *limiting* assumptions remain adequate is a logical flaw; the extended equation works better precisely because it relaxes one of the limiting assumptions (point ions).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the theoretical and quantitative analysis, option A provides the most accurate and complete description.",

For an electrolyte with stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_+$ and $\\nu_-$, the mean activity coefficient is $ \\gamma_{\\pm} = \\left(\\gamma_+^{\\nu_+} \\gamma_-^{\\nu_-}\\right)^{1/(\\nu_+ + \\nu_-)}$. For $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2}$, $\\nu_+ = 1$ and $\\nu_- = 2$, so $\\nu_+ + \\nu_- = 3$. The ionic strength is $ I = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i m_i z_i^2 $, and for $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2}$ treated as fully dissociated into $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$, one has $m_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} = m$ and $m_{\\mathrm{Cl}^-} = 2m$, so $ I = 3m $.\n\nYou are to construct and test a hybrid activity-coefficient model that blends the long-range electrostatic contribution consistent with Debye–Hückel theory and a short-range specific interaction term consistent with the Specific Ion Interaction Theory (SIT), for the mean activity coefficient of $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2}$ as a function of molality $m$ up to $6\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$. The standard state is the infinite dilution reference where $\\gamma_{\\pm} \\to 1$ as $m \\to 0$.\n\nYour task is:\n- From the fundamental definitions above and the long-range Debye–Hückel concept, derive a computationally usable expression for the mean activity coefficient of CaCl$_2$ that includes a single short-range interaction parameter in the spirit of SIT.\n- Given synthetic but physically plausible \"experimental\" data sets of $\\gamma_{\\pm}(m)$, test whether the chosen Debye–Hückel–SIT hybrid captures the curvature of $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm}$ as a function of $m$ over $m \\in [0.1, 6.0]\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$. Here, “curvature captured” is operationally defined as the root-mean-square error (RMSE) in $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm}$ between the hybrid model fit (with only the single short-range parameter) and the experimental dataset being less than or equal to a threshold $T$.\n- If the curvature is not captured (RMSE $$ $T$), propose a minimal correction term consistent with physically motivated higher-order short-range interactions, add it to the hybrid, and refit to the same data set. Report the fitted coefficient of this correction term.\n- All modeling and fitting must be performed on $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm}$, which is dimensionless. Report all outputs as dimensionless quantities. Angles are not present, and no percentages are required.\n\nUse the following physically plausible constants and definitions in your derivation and computation, without inventing new ones:\n- Charges: $z_+ = +2$, $z_- = -1$.\n- Ionic strength: $I = 3m$. for $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2}$.\n- Debye–Hückel constants at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for the base-10 formulation: $A = 0.509$ and $B = 0.328\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}$.\n- An effective ion-size parameter $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (in $\\mathrm{\\AA}$) to be specified per test case.\n\nThe synthetic \"experimental\" $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm}(m)$ data are constructed over the molality grid $m \\in \\{0.1,\\,0.5,\\,1.0,\\,2.0,\\,3.5,\\,6.0\\}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ as the sum of a Debye–Hückel long-range term and short-range terms up to second order in $m$ (this reflects realistic upward or downward curvature at high concentration). You are not given the generating formula in the problem statement; instead, you will use the constants below to reproduce the data internally for testing.\n\nTest suite (each case specifies $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in $\\mathrm{\\AA}$, a linear short-range coefficient $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{true}}$ in $\\mathrm{(mol\\,kg^{-1})^{-1}}$, and a quadratic short-range coefficient $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{true}}$ in $\\mathrm{(mol\\,kg^{-1})^{-2}}$):\n- Case 1 (happy path, mild curvature): $a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 4.0$, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.08$, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.005$.\n- Case 2 (strong curvature): $a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 3.5$, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.04$, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.012$.\n- Case 3 (near-linear behavior): $a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 4.0$, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.06$, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.000$.\n- Case 4 (downward curvature at high $m$): $a_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 4.5$, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{true}} = 0.10$, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{true}} = -0.004$.\n\nDecision threshold:\n- Use $T = 0.05$ for the RMSE on $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm}$.\n\nModel-fitting and decision protocol:\n- Fit the hybrid with a single short-range parameter by least squares on $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm}$ as a function of $m$ across the grid.\n- Compute the RMSE of this fit.\n- If RMSE $\\leq T$, declare “curvature captured” and do not add a correction term.\n- If RMSE $ T$, introduce the minimal correction term you deem appropriate based on your derivation, refit, and report the fitted coefficient of this correction term.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.\n- For each of the four cases, output two values in order: first, a boolean indicating whether the single-parameter hybrid captures the curvature (True if RMSE $\\leq T$, False otherwise), and second, the fitted coefficient of the proposed correction term if the curvature is not captured; otherwise output $0.0$ for the correction term.

            "solution": "The user has provided a valid problem statement. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of physical chemistry, specifically electrolyte solution theory, and is well-posed with a clear, objective procedure for modeling and evaluation. All necessary data and constants are provided. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to construct and test a hybrid model for the mean activity coefficient, $\\gamma_{\\pm}$, of aqueous calcium chloride ($\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$) at a temperature of $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The model will combine the long-range electrostatic interactions described by Debye–Hückel theory with a short-range term inspired by Specific Ion Interaction Theory (SIT).\n\nFirst, we derive the mathematical expression for the model. The analysis will be performed on $\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Long-Range Debye–Hückel Term**\n\nThe extended Debye–Hückel theory provides an expression for the base-$10$ logarithm of the activity coefficient of a single ion $i$ as a function of ionic strength $I$:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_i = - \\frac{A z_i^2 \\sqrt{I}}{1 + B a_i \\sqrt{I}} $$\nwhere $z_i$ is the charge number of the ion, $a_i$ is its effective hydrated radius, and $A$ and $B$ are solvent- and temperature-dependent constants. For water at $T=298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the given values are $A = 0.509$ and $B = 0.328\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}^{-1}$.\n\nThe mean activity coefficient $\\gamma_{\\pm}$ for an electrolyte $C_{\\nu_+}A_{\\nu_-}$ is defined from the individual ionic activity coefficients $\\gamma_+$ and $\\gamma_-$ as:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{\\nu_+ + \\nu_-} (\\nu_+ \\log_{10} \\gamma_+ + \\nu_- \\log_{10} \\gamma_-) $$\nFor $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$, the dissociation is $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} + 2\\mathrm{Cl}^-$. The stoichiometric coefficients are $\\nu_+ = 1$ and $\\nu_- = 2$, and the ion charges are $z_+ = +2$ and $z_- = -1$.\nSubstituting the single-ion expressions into the equation for the mean, and assuming a common effective ion-size parameter $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for both ions ($a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} \\approx a_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} \\approx a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$), we get:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{\\nu_+ + \\nu_-} \\left( \\nu_+ \\left(- \\frac{A z_+^2 \\sqrt{I}}{1 + B a_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{I}}\\right) + \\nu_- \\left(- \\frac{A z_-^2 \\sqrt{I}}{1 + B a_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{I}}\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm} = - \\frac{A \\sqrt{I}}{1 + B a_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{I}} \\left( \\frac{\\nu_+ z_+^2 + \\nu_- z_-^2}{\\nu_+ + \\nu_-} \\right) $$\nThe term in the parenthesis simplifies due to the electroneutrality condition ($\\nu_+ z_+ + \\nu_- z_- = 0$) to the absolute product of the charges, $|z_+ z_-|$. For $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$, this is $|(+2)(-1)| = 2$. Therefore, the Debye–Hückel contribution to the mean activity coefficient is:\n$$ (\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{DH}} = - \\frac{2A\\sqrt{I}}{1 + B a_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{I}} $$\nThe ionic strength $I$ for a molality $m$ of $\\mathrm{CaCl}_2$ is given by $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i m_i z_i^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(m \\cdot z_+^2 + 2m \\cdot z_-^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(m \\cdot (+2)^2 + 2m \\cdot (-1)^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(4m + 2m) = 3m$.\nSubstituting $I = 3m$ into the expression gives the final form of the long-range term:\n$$ (\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{DH}} = - \\frac{2A\\sqrt{3m}}{1 + B a_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{3m}} $$\n\n**2. Formulation of the Hybrid Models**\n\nTo account for short-range, non-electrostatic interactions, we augment the Debye–Hückel term with additional terms, following the principles of SIT and virial expansions of the excess Gibbs energy.\n\n**Model 1: Single Short-Range Parameter**\nThe simplest extension is to add a term linear in concentration. In geochemistry, this term often represents binary interactions (e.g., $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-$\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$). We add a term $\\varepsilon m$, where $\\varepsilon$ is a single adjustable parameter representing the net effect of short-range forces. This gives our primary hybrid model:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm}(m) = - \\frac{2A\\sqrt{3m}}{1 + B a_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{3m}} + \\varepsilon m $$\nThis is a one-parameter model, as $\\varepsilon$ is the only coefficient to be fitted for a given test case (where $a_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is fixed).\n\n**Model 2: Minimal Correction Term for Curvature**\nIf Model 1 fails to capture the curvature of the experimental data (i.e., the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the fit is above a threshold $T$), we must add a correction. The next logical term in a virial expansion in molality is a quadratic term, $\\kappa m^2$. This term can account for higher-order interactions (e.g., ternary interactions like $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-$\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-$\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) or the concentration dependence of the binary interaction parameter $\\varepsilon$. The corrected two-parameter model is:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\pm}(m) = - \\frac{2A\\sqrt{3m}}{1 + B a_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{3m}} + \\varepsilon m + \\kappa m^2 $$\nHere, both $\\varepsilon$ and $\\kappa$ are fitted simultaneously. The coefficient of the correction term is $\\kappa$.\n\n**3. Computational and Fitting Protocol**\n\nThe task is to test these models against synthetic \"experimental\" data for each of four cases. The protocol is as follows:\n\nFor each test case `(a_eff, eps_true, kappa_true)`:\n1.  **Generate Synthetic Data**: The experimental data, $(\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{exp}}$, is generated for each molality $m$ in the grid $\\{0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.5, 6.0\\}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ using the two-parameter model form and the provided `true` coefficients:\n    $$ (\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{exp}} = - \\frac{2A\\sqrt{3m}}{1 + B a_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\sqrt{3m}} + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{true}} m + \\kappa_{\\mathrm{true}} m^2 $$\n2.  **Fit One-Parameter Model**: We fit Model 1 to the generated data. This is a linear least-squares problem. Let $y_i = (\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ at molality $m_i$, and let $(\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{DH},i}$ be the corresponding Debye–Hückel term. We seek the parameter $\\varepsilon$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals for the equation:\n    $$ y_i - (\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{DH},i} = \\varepsilon m_i $$\n    This is a regression of the short-range part of the activity coefficient against molality. In matrix form, we solve $\\mathbf{y}' = \\mathbf{X}\\beta$ for $\\beta = [\\varepsilon]$, where $\\mathbf{y}'$ is the vector of short-range contributions and $\\mathbf{X}$ is a column vector of molalities $m_i$.\n3.  **Evaluate Fit**: We calculate the predicted values from the fitted model, $(\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{pred},1}$, and compute the root-mean-square error:\n    $$ \\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( (\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{exp},i} - (\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{pred},1,i} \\right)^2} $$\n4.  **Decision**: We compare the RMSE to the threshold $T=0.05$.\n    -   If $\\mathrm{RMSE} \\le T$, the curvature is considered \"captured\". The result for this case is `(True, 0.0)`.\n    -   If $\\mathrm{RMSE}  T$, the curvature is not captured. We proceed to the next step.\n5.  **Fit Two-Parameter Model**: We fit Model 2 to the same experimental data. This is also a linear least-squares problem, now for two parameters:\n    $$ y_i - (\\log_{10}\\gamma_{\\pm})_{\\mathrm{DH},i} = \\varepsilon m_i + \\kappa m_i^2 $$\n    We solve $\\mathbf{y}' = \\mathbf{X}\\beta$ for $\\beta = [\\varepsilon, \\kappa]^T$, where the design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ now has two columns: a vector of molalities $m_i$ and a vector of molalities squared, $m_i^2$. The fitted value of $\\kappa$ is the coefficient of the correction term. The result for this case is `(False, kappa_fit)`.\n\nThis entire procedure is implemented for all four test cases to produce the final output.",
