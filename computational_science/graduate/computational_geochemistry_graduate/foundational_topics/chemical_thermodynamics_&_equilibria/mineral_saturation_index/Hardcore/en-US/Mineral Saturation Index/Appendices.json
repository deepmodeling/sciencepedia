It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to compute a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to calculate the Saturation Index (SI) for the mineral dolomite in a groundwater sample. The dissolution reaction is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{CaMg(CO_3)_2(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}} + \\mathrm{Mg^{2+}} + 2\\,\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}} $$\nThe reaction quotient, $Q$, is defined by the activities of the products and reactants. For a general reaction $aA + bB \\rightleftharpoons cC + dD$, the reaction quotient is $Q = \\frac{a_C^c a_D^d}{a_A^a a_B^b}$. Applying this to the dolomite dissolution reaction, we get:\n$$ Q = \\frac{(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}) (a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}) (a_{\\mathrm{CO_3}^{2-}})^{2}}{a_{\\mathrm{CaMg(CO_3)_2(s)}}} $$\nAccording to standard-state thermodynamic conventions, the activity of a pure solid is unity. Thus, for dolomite, $a_{\\mathrm{CaMg(CO_3)_2(s)}} = 1$. The reaction quotient, in this case often referred to as the Ion Activity Product (IAP), simplifies to:\n$$ Q = (a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}) (a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}) (a_{\\mathrm{CO_3}^{2-}})^{2} $$\nThe Saturation Index (SI) is defined on a base-$10$ logarithmic scale as the ratio of the reaction quotient $Q$ to the equilibrium constant $K$:\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{Q}{K}\\right) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this expression can be conveniently split into two terms:\n$$ \\mathrm{SI} = \\log_{10}(Q) - \\log_{10}(K) $$\nTo calculate $\\mathrm{SI}$, we first need to determine the value of $\\log_{10}(Q)$. Using the expression for $Q$ derived above:\n$$ \\log_{10}(Q) = \\log_{10}\\left((a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}) (a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}) (a_{\\mathrm{CO_3}^{2-}})^{2}\\right) $$\nApplying logarithm rules, this becomes:\n$$ \\log_{10}(Q) = \\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}) + \\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}) + 2 \\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{CO_3}^{2-}}) $$\nThe problem provides the following activity values:\n$a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} = 10^{-3.2}$\n$a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}} = 10^{-3.5}$\n$a_{\\mathrm{CO_3}^{2-}} = 10^{-4.7}$\n\nFrom these, we can directly find their base-$10$ logarithms:\n$\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}) = -3.2$\n$\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}) = -3.5$\n$\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{CO_3}^{2-}}) = -4.7$\n\nSubstituting these logarithmic values into the expression for $\\log_{10}(Q)$:\n$$ \\log_{10}(Q) = (-3.2) + (-3.5) + 2(-4.7) $$\n$$ \\log_{10}(Q) = -3.2 - 3.5 - 9.4 $$\n$$ \\log_{10}(Q) = -16.1 $$\nThe problem also provides the logarithm of the equilibrium constant, $\\log_{10}(K) = -17.09$.

A positive SI, as found here ($0.99 > 0$), indicates that $\\log_{10}(Q) > \\log_{10}(K)$, which implies that $Q > K$. The water is therefore supersaturated with respect to dolomite, and there is a thermodynamic driving force for the mineral to precipitate from the solution. Conversely, a negative SI would indicate undersaturation and a driving force for dissolution, while an SI of zero signifies equilibrium.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.99$. To express this numerical result with four significant figures of precision, we must write it as $0.9900$.",

The chemical reaction is written in a valid, explicit-solvent convention. The law of mass action, activity-concentration relationships, and the definition of the Saturation Index are all fundamental principles of thermodynamics and aqueous geochemistry. The given values for molality, activity coefficient, and water activity are physically realistic for a brackish water sample.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and definitions to calculate the reaction quotient (`$Q$`) and the Saturation Index (`$SI$`). The objective is clearly stated: calculate `$SI$` and evaluate the reasoning behind the calculation. A unique solution can be determined from the provided information.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to apply the law of mass action to the given chemical reaction and then compute the Saturation Index (`$SI$`).\n\n1.  **Construct the Reaction Quotient ($Q$)**: The law of mass action defines the reaction quotient `$Q$` for the reaction `$\\mathrm{SiO_2(s)} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}$` as:\n    $$Q = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}}{a_{\\mathrm{SiO_2(s)}} \\cdot a_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^2}$$\n    The problem states that quartz `$\\mathrm{SiO_2(s)}$` is a pure solid, so its activity is unity: `$a_{\\mathrm{SiO_2(s)}} = 1$`. The expression for `$Q$` simplifies to:\n    $$Q = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}}{a_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^2}$$\n    This expression correctly includes the activity of the solvent, water, raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient, `$2$`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Activities and the Reaction Quotient**: The activity of an aqueous species is the product of its activity coefficient and its molality. For monomeric silicic acid:\n    $$a_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}} \\cdot m_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}$$\n    Using the given values:\n    $$a_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}} = (1.10) \\cdot (1.5\\times 10^{-4}) = 1.65\\times 10^{-4}$$\n    Now, substitute this activity and the given activity of water (`$a_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.97$`) into the expression for `$Q$`:\n    $$Q = \\frac{1.65\\times 10^{-4}}{(0.97)^2} = \\frac{1.65\\times 10^{-4}}{0.9409} \\approx 1.753639 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Saturation Index ($SI$)**: The Saturation Index is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the reaction quotient `$Q$` to the equilibrium constant `$K$`:\n    $$\\mathrm{SI} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{Q}{K}\\right) = \\log_{10} Q - \\log_{10} K$$\n    We are given `$\\log_{10} K = -3.92$`. We first calculate `$\\log_{10} Q$`:\n    $$\\log_{10} Q = \\log_{10}(1.753639 \\times 10^{-4}) \\approx -3.75605$$\n    Now, we compute `$SI$`:\n    $$\\mathrm{SI} = (-3.75605) - (-3.92) = 0.16395$$\n    The problem asks for the numerical `$SI$` to two significant figures. Rounding `$0.16395$` to two significant figures gives:\n    $$\\mathrm{SI} \\approx 0.16$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $Q = a_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}$; $\\mathrm{SI} \\approx 0.14$. Because $\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}$ is neutral, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}$ may be taken as $1$ at any ionic strength, and the solvent activity $a_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}$ should be omitted from $Q$.**\n-   **Reasoning**: This option is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, the formulation `$Q = a_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}$` incorrectly omits the activity of water from the denominator. Since water is an explicit reactant with a stoichiometric coefficient of `$2$`, `$a_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^2$` must appear in the denominator of `$Q$`. Second, the statement that the activity coefficient of a neutral species `$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}$` may be taken as `$1$` is false. Non-ideal behavior (salting effects) affects neutral species in electrolyte solutions, which is why the problem provides `$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}} = 1.10$`.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. $Q = a_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}/a_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{2}$ with $a_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}=\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}\\,m_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}$; $\\mathrm{SI} \\approx 0.17$. Neutral species enter $Q$ through their activities and can have non-ideal $\\gamma$ values that deviate from $1$; the solvent activity must appear with its stoichiometric power.**\n-   **Reasoning**: The formulation of `$Q$`, the definition of activity, and the accompanying conceptual explanations are all correct. It correctly states that neutral species have activities (`$a = \\gamma m$`) and can have non-ideal behavior (`$\\gamma \\neq 1$`). It also correctly includes the activity of the solvent raised to its stoichiometric power. The derived numerical value for `$SI$` is `$\\approx 0.17$`. My rigorous calculation yields `$SI \\approx 0.16$`. This minor discrepancy likely arises from a rounding step made in the problem's source material (e.g., rounding `$\\log_{10} Q \\approx -3.756$` to `$-3.75$` before subtracting `$\\log_{10} K$`, which yields `$SI = -3.75 - (-3.92) = 0.17$`). Despite this small numerical inconsistency, the underlying principles and formulas presented in this option are entirely correct and superior to all other options.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. $Q = m_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}/a_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{2}$; $\\mathrm{SI} \\approx 0.12$. Neutral species have no role in non-ideality of $Q$ beyond their concentration, so their activity coefficient can be ignored.**\n-   **Reasoning**: This option incorrectly uses molality (`$m$`) in place of activity (`$a$`) for the silicic acid in the reaction quotient. The law of mass action is fundamentally based on activities. The justification that the activity coefficient can be ignored is a direct contradiction of the provided data (`$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}} = 1.10$`) and is scientifically incorrect for non-ideal solutions.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. $Q = a_{\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}}\\,a_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{2}$; $\\mathrm{SI} \\approx 0.11$. Since $\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}$ is neutral, $Q$ must also include ionic dissociation products (e.g., $H^+$ and $\\mathrm{H_3SiO_4^-}$) to represent the silica speciation in solution.**\n-   **Reasoning**: This option incorrectly places the activity of the reactant, water, in the numerator of `$Q$`. Reactant activities belong in the denominator. The accompanying reasoning is also flawed; the reaction quotient `$Q$` must match the specific reaction for which the equilibrium constant `$K$` is given. Including species from other, subsequent reactions (like the dissociation of `$\\mathrm{H_4SiO_4^0}$`) is incorrect for calculating the saturation index *with respect to this specific dissolution reaction*.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.",

The ion activity product (IAP) for calcium carbonate ($\\mathrm{CaCO}_3$) is $\\mathrm{IAP} = a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}} a_{\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}}$.\n\nThe Davies equation is given for estimating activity coefficients:\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_i = -A z_i^2 \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}} - 0.3 I \\right) $$\nGiven $A=0.51$ and $I=0.10$, we first compute the term in parentheses:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{0.10}}{1+\\sqrt{0.10}} - 0.3(0.10) \\approx \\frac{0.3162}{1.3162} - 0.03 \\approx 0.2402 - 0.03 = 0.2102 $$\nFor both $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$, the charge magnitude is $2$, so $z_i^2 = 4$.

A purely thermodynamic argument would predict that calcite should precipitate.\n\n3.  **Application of Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT)**\n\nNucleation is a kinetic process that must overcome a free energy barrier, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. According to CNT, for homogeneous nucleation of a spherical nucleus, this barrier is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{16\\pi}{3} \\frac{\\gamma^3 v_m^2}{(\\Delta\\mu)^2} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the interfacial free energy, $v_m$ is the molar volume of the solid, and $\\Delta\\mu$ is the difference in chemical potential between the solution and the solid, representing the thermodynamic driving force. The rate of nucleation, $J$, is exponentially dependent on this barrier: $J \\propto \\exp(-\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{crit}}/k_B T)$.\n\nThe driving force $\\Delta\\mu$ is related to the saturation index by $\\Delta\\mu = R T \\ln(\\Omega) = (2.303) R T \\cdot \\mathrm{SI}$, where $\\Omega = \\mathrm{IAP}/K_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 10^{\\mathrm{SI}}$ is the saturation ratio. On a per-molecule basis, $\\Delta\\mu = k_B T \\ln(\\Omega) = (2.303) k_B T \\cdot \\mathrm{SI}$.\n\nThus, the nucleation barrier can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\propto \\frac{\\gamma^3}{(\\mathrm{SI})^2} $$\nThe nucleation rate is therefore highly sensitive to both the interfacial free energy (cubed dependence) and the saturation index (inverse square dependence).\n\nLet's compare the term $\\gamma^3 / (\\mathrm{SI})^2$ for calcite and aragonite under the specified conditions.\n\nFor calcite: $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{calcite}}=0.25\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$ and $\\mathrm{SI}_{\\mathrm{calcite}} \\approx 0.498$.\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{calcite}}^3}{(\\mathrm{SI}_{\\mathrm{calcite}})^2} = \\frac{(0.25)^3}{(0.498)^2} \\approx \\frac{0.015625}{0.248} \\approx 0.0630 $$\n\nFor aragonite: $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{aragonite}}=0.15\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$ and $\\mathrm{SI}_{\\mathrm{aragonite}} \\approx 0.357$.\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{aragonite}}^3}{(\\mathrm{SI}_{\\mathrm{aragonite}})^2} = \\frac{(0.15)^3}{(0.357)^2} \\approx \\frac{0.003375}{0.1274} \\approx 0.0265 $$\n\nComparing the two values, $0.0265 < 0.0630$. This implies that $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{crit, aragonite}} < \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{crit, calcite}}$. The kinetic barrier for aragonite nucleation is significantly lower than for calcite, despite calcite having a higher thermodynamic driving force (larger SI). The high interfacial energy of calcite, induced by $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ adsorption, creates a formidable nucleation barrier that may be insurmountable on reasonable timescales, thus kinetically inhibiting calcite nucleation. Conversely, the reduction of aragonite's interfacial energy by $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ lowers its nucleation barrier, making its formation kinetically favorable. This is a classic demonstration of kinetic control over mineral precipitation, leading to the formation of a metastable phase (aragonite) in preference to the thermodynamically stable phase (calcite), a phenomenon often explained by Ostwald's Step Rule.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n\nA. Because the saturation index being greater than zero guarantees spontaneous nucleation without delay, calcite must nucleate first; metastable aragonite cannot form at a smaller saturation index than calcite under any circumstances.\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A positive saturation index provides a thermodynamic driving force, but does not guarantee nucleation, which is a kinetic process limited by an energy barrier. The nucleation rate can be effectively zero if the barrier is too high. The claim that a metastable phase cannot form at a smaller saturation index is false, as our analysis demonstrates that kinetics can favor the metastable phase.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nB. Adsorption of $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ onto calcite steps raises the effective interfacial free energy, increasing the nucleation barrier so that calcite may not nucleate despite a positive saturation index, while $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ lowers aragonite’s effective interfacial free energy, allowing aragonite to nucleate metastably at a smaller saturation index.\nThis statement accurately summarizes the outcome of our analysis. It correctly links the impurity effects ($\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, $\\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$) to changes in interfacial free energy ($\\gamma$), the consequence for the nucleation barrier ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{crit}}$), and the ultimate outcome on nucleation preference. It correctly explains why calcite might not nucleate despite being supersaturated and why metastable aragonite can nucleate even with a lower SI.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\nC. At ionic strength $I=0.10$, activity coefficients are approximately unity; therefore both calcite and aragonite are undersaturated, explaining the absence of calcite nucleation and excluding the possibility of metastable aragonite.\nThis statement's premise is false. As calculated, the activity coefficient for divalent ions at $I=0.10$ is $\\gamma_{\\pm 2} \\approx 0.37$, which is far from unity. Consequently, the conclusion that the solution is undersaturated is also false; we calculated positive saturation indices for both minerals. Therefore, the entire reasoning is invalid.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\nD. Aragonite can only nucleate if its saturation index exceeds that of calcite by at least $1.0$ on a base-$10$ logarithmic scale; otherwise calcite necessarily nucleates first due to its lower solubility.\nThis presents an arbitrary and unfounded rule. There is no physical law requiring a specific difference in SI for metastable nucleation. Our analysis shows aragonite can nucleate with a *smaller* SI than calcite due to kinetic factors. The claim that calcite \"necessarily nucleates first\" due to lower solubility is a purely thermodynamic argument that incorrectly neglects the decisive role of kinetics.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.",
