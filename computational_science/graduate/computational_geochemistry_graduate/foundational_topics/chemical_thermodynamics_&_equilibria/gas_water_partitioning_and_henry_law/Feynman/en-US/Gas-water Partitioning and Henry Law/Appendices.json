The provided numerical values and units are realistic and standard in the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is fully specified. It provides the governing equation, the initial value, the target units, and the necessary conversion factor. A unique and stable solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The language is quantitative and precise, free from any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core principle for converting the Henry's law constant, $H_{cp}$, is the invariance of the physical state. For a given physical system at equilibrium, the dissolved concentration of the gas, $c$, is a fixed physical quantity. Its numerical value depends on the chosen units, but the underlying physical reality does not change.\n\nHenry's law is given as $c = H_{cp}\\,p$. Let us denote the quantities in the literature system (using atmospheres for pressure) with subscript $1$ and the quantities in the target SI system (using pascals for pressure) with subscript $2$.\n\nThe law can be written in both systems:\n$1$. Literature system: $c = H_{cp,1} \\, p_1$, where the units are $c$ in $\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$, $p_1$ in $\\mathrm{atm}$, and $H_{cp,1}$ in $\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}\\ atm^{-1}}$.\n$2$. SI system: $c = H_{cp,2} \\, p_2$, where the units are $c$ in $\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$, $p_2$ in $\\mathrm{Pa}$, and $H_{cp,2}$ in $\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}\\ Pa^{-1}}$.\n\nSince the physical concentration $c$ is the same in both descriptions for the same physical state, we can equate the two expressions:\n$$H_{cp,1} \\, p_1 = H_{cp,2} \\, p_2$$\n\nTo derive the relationship between $H_{cp,1}$ and $H_{cp,2}$, we must relate the numerical values of the partial pressure, $p_1$ and $p_2$. The physical pressure is also invariant. Let the conversion factor between atmospheres and pascals be $\\kappa$, such that:\n$$1\\ \\mathrm{atm} = \\kappa\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\nNumerically, $\\kappa = 1.01325 \\times 10^{5}$.\nFor any given pressure, its numerical value in atmospheres, $p_1$, and its numerical value in pascals, $p_2$, are related by:\n$$p_2 = \\kappa \\, p_1$$\n\nSubstituting this relationship into our invariance equation:\n$$H_{cp,1} \\, p_1 = H_{cp,2} \\, (\\kappa \\, p_1)$$\n\nSince this relation must hold for any non-zero partial pressure, we can divide both sides by $p_1$:\n$$H_{cp,1} = \\kappa \\, H_{cp,2}$$\n\nThis is the general transformation rule. To find the Henry's constant in SI units ($H_{cp,2}$) from the literature value ($H_{cp,1}$), we rearrange the equation:\n$$H_{cp,2} = \\frac{H_{cp,1}}{\\kappa}$$\n\nThis derivation is justified by dimensional analysis. The units of $H_{cp,1}$ are $[\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}\\ atm^{-1}}]$, and the units of $\\kappa$ are $[\\mathrm{Pa\\ atm^{-1}}]$. The units of the calculated $H_{cp,2}$ are:\n$$\\frac{[\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}\\ atm^{-1}}]}{[\\mathrm{Pa\\ atm^{-1}}]} = [\\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}\\ Pa^{-1}}]$$\nThe resulting units match the target units, which confirms the correctness of our derived transformation.\n\nNow, we apply this transformation to the given values:\n- $H_{cp,1} = 29\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}\\ atm^{-1}}$\n- $\\kappa = 1.01325 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\ atm^{-1}}$\n\n$$H_{cp,2} = \\frac{29}{1.01325 \\times 10^{5}}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}\\ Pa^{-1}}$$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$H_{cp,2} \\approx 2.8619393 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}\\ Pa^{-1}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $8$, $6$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $9$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$H_{cp,2} \\approx 2.862 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}\\ Pa^{-1}}$$\nThis is the value of the Henry's constant in the required SI units.",

This implies the system has had sufficient time to equilibrate and the net flux of the species across the phase boundary is zero.\n\n2.  **Ideal Gas Behavior**: The gas phase is treated as an ideal gas. This is equivalent to assuming that the fugacity of the gas, $f_g$, is equal to its partial pressure, $p$. This assumption is generally valid at low pressures (near or below $1\\ \\text{atm}$) but becomes less accurate at higher pressures where intermolecular forces and finite molecular volumes are no longer negligible. For high-pressure geochemical systems, a fugacity coefficient, $\\phi$, must be introduced ($f_g = \\phi \\cdot p$).\n\n3.  **Infinite Dilution**: The aqueous solution is assumed to be infinitely dilute with respect to the dissolved gas. This means the concentration of the solute is low enough that solute-solute interactions are negligible. Thermodynamically, this implies that the activity coefficient of the aqueous species is unity ($\\gamma_{aq} = 1$), and its activity, $a_{aq}$, can be equated with its molar concentration (or molality, depending on the standard state). The presence of other dissolved components, particularly salts, can alter gas solubility (the \"salting-out\" effect), which would require corrections to Henry's constant.\n\n4.  **Pure and Incompressible Solvent**: The solvent is assumed to be pure water, and its properties are not affected by the dissolved gas. It is also assumed to be incompressible, which is a very good approximation for liquid water under typical crustal pressures.\n\n5.  **Isothermal System**: The temperature $T$ is assumed to be constant and uniform throughout both phases. This is a critical assumption, as Henry's law constants are strongly dependent on temperature.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the formalization and derivation of two models to explain deviations from classical Henry's law in the presence of entrapped air bubbles in water. The analysis will proceed by first establishing a baseline concentration based on equilibrium with the atmosphere. Then, two distinct scenarios will be modeled: a closed system where a fixed amount of gas partitions between water and a bubble phase, and an open system where water equilibrates with bubbles whose properties are determined by external environmental conditions. For each model, we will derive an expression for the new equilibrium concentration and the resulting relative deviation from the baseline.\n\nThe fundamental physical principles governing this system are:\n1.  **Henry's Law**: The equilibrium molar concentration $c_i$ of a dissolved gas $i$ is proportional to its partial pressure $p_i$ in the gas phase: $c_i = k_H^i(T) p_i$. The constant of proportionality, $k_H^i(T)$, is the Henry's law constant.\n2.  **Ideal Gas Law (IGL)**: The number of moles $n_i$ of a gas species $i$ in a volume $V$ is given by $n_i = \\frac{p_i V}{R T}$, where $p_i$ is its partial pressure, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n3.  **Bubble Internal Pressure**: The absolute pressure inside a bubble, $P_b$, is the sum of the ambient atmospheric pressure $P_{\\mathrm{atm}}$, the hydrostatic pressure $P_{\\mathrm{hyd}} = \\rho g h$ due to depth $h$, and the Laplace pressure $P_{\\mathrm{Laplace}} = \\frac{2 \\gamma}{R_b}$ due to surface tension $\\gamma$ acting on a bubble of radius $R_b$.\n\n**Baseline Equilibrium Concentration ($c_{\\mathrm{base}}$)**\n\nThe reference state is bubble-free water in equilibrium with the standard atmosphere at pressure $P_{\\mathrm{atm}}$. The partial pressure of a gas species $i$ in the atmosphere is $p_{i, \\mathrm{atm}} = y_i P_{\\mathrm{atm}}$, where $y_i$ is its mole fraction in dry air. According to Henry's law, the corresponding dissolved concentration, which we define as the baseline concentration $c_{\\mathrm{base}}^i$, is:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{base}}^i = k_H^i(T) p_{i, \\mathrm{atm}} = k_H^i(T) y_i P_{\\mathrm{atm}}$$\n\n**Model 1: Closed-System Partitioning**\n\nThis model considers a fixed total amount of a noble gas species $i$, $n_i^{\\mathrm{tot}}$, contained within a closed system comprising a water volume $V_w$ and a total bubble volume $V_b$.

The moles in the aqueous phase are:\n$$n_{i,w} = c_i V_w$$\nThe moles in the bubble phase are given by the IGL, where $p_i$ is the partial pressure of species $i$ in the bubbles at the new equilibrium:\n$$n_{i,b} = \\frac{p_i V_b}{R T}$$\nAt equilibrium, $c_i$ and $p_i$ are related by Henry's law: $p_i = \\frac{c_i}{k_H^i(T)}$.

The relative deviation $\\delta$ from the baseline is:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{c_i - c_{\\mathrm{base}}^i}{c_{\\mathrm{base}}^i} = \\frac{c_i}{c_{\\mathrm{base}}^i} - 1 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\phi_b}{k_H^i R T}} - 1 = \\frac{1 - (1 + \\frac{\\phi_b}{k_H^i R T})}{1 + \\frac{\\phi_b}{k_H^i R T}} = \\frac{-\\frac{\\phi_b}{k_H^i R T}}{1 + \\frac{\\phi_b}{k_H^i R T}}$$\nThis result shows $\\delta \\le 0$, indicating that introducing a bubble phase into a closed system causes gas to partition out of the aqueous phase, lowering the dissolved concentration.\n\n**Model 2: Open-System Interfacial Equilibrium**\n\nThis model describes water in equilibrium with bubbles whose internal pressure $P_b$ and composition are fixed by external factors, as if buffered by a large reservoir.

The excess pressure within the bubbles drives gas into the solution, causing the water to become supersaturated relative to atmospheric equilibrium.\n\n**Calculations for Test Cases**\n\nThe following constants are used for the calculations:\n- $P_{\\mathrm{atm}} = 101325 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\rho = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n- $g = 9.80665 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n- $\\gamma = 0.072 \\ \\mathrm{N/m}$\n- $R = 8.314462618 \\ \\mathrm{J/(mol \\cdot K)}$\n- $T = 298.15 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $k_H^{\\mathrm{Ar}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{mol/(m^3 \\cdot Pa)}$\n- $k_H^{\\mathrm{Ne}} = 4.8 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{mol/(m^3 \\cdot Pa)}$\n- $y_{\\mathrm{Ar}} = 9.34 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $y_{\\mathrm{Ne}} = 1.818 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\n1.  **Closed, Ar, $\\phi_b = 0.0$**: Here $\\phi_b = 0$, so from the closed-system formula, $\\delta = 0$.\n2.  **Closed, Ar, $\\phi_b = 0.01$**: Using the closed-system formula with $k_H^{\\mathrm{Ar}}$:\n    $k_H^{\\mathrm{Ar}} R T = (1.5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 8.314462618 \\times 298.15 \\approx 0.037233$.\n    $\\delta = - \\frac{0.01/0.037233...}{1 + 0.01/0.037233...} \\approx -0.211710$.\n3.  **Closed, Ar, $\\phi_b = 0.3$**: Using the closed-system formula:\n    $\\delta = - \\frac{0.3/0.037233...}{1 + 0.3/0.037233...} \\approx -0.889591$.\n4.  **Open, Ar, $h=10.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $R_b=50 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$**: Using the open-system formula. The species is irrelevant for $\\delta$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{hyd}} = 1000 \\times 9.80665 \\times 10.0 = 98066.5 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{Laplace}} = (2 \\times 0.072) / (50 \\times 10^{-6}) = 2880 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n    $\\delta = (98066.5 + 2880) / 101325 = 100946.5 / 101325 \\approx 0.996264$.\n5.  **Open, Ar, $h=0.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $R_b=1 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$**: Using the open-system formula.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{hyd}} = 0 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{Laplace}} = (2 \\times 0.072) / (1 \\times 10^{-6}) = 144000 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n    $\\delta = (0 + 144000) / 101325 \\approx 1.421150$.\n6.  **Open, Ne, $h=100.0 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $R_b=100 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$**: Using the open-system formula.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{hyd}} = 1000 \\times 9.80665 \\times 100.0 = 980665 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n    $P_{\\mathrm{Laplace}} = (2 \\times 0.072) / (100 \\times 10^{-6}) = 1440 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n    $\\delta = (980665 + 1440) / 101325 = 982105 / 101325 \\approx 9.692621$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the relative deviation in dissolved noble gas concentration\n    due to entrapped air bubbles, based on two equilibrium models.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define constants and parameters ---\n    CONSTANTS = {\n        \"P_atm\": 101325,       # Pa\n        \"rho\": 1000,           # kg/m^3\n        \"g\": 9.80665,          # m/s^2\n        \"gamma\": 0.072,        # N/m\n        \"R\": 8.314462618,      # J/(mol.K)\n        \"T\": 298.15,           # K\n    }\n    \n    GAS_PROPERTIES = {\n        \"Ar\": {\n            \"kH\": 1.5e-5,      # mol/(m^3.Pa)\n            \"y\": 9.34e-3       # mole fraction in air\n        },\n        \"Ne\": {\n            \"kH\": 4.8e-6,      # mol/(m^3.Pa)\n            \"y\": 1.818e-5      # mole fraction in air\n        }\n    }\n\n    # --- Define test cases ---\n    # Each case is a dictionary specifying the model and its parameters.\n    test_cases = [\n        {\"model\": \"closed\", \"species\": \"Ar\", \"phi_b\": 0.0},\n        {\"model\": \"closed\", \"species\": \"Ar\", \"phi_b\": 0.01},\n        {\"model\": \"closed\", \"species\": \"Ar\", \"phi_b\": 0.3},\n        {\"model\": \"open\", \"species\": \"Ar\", \"h\": 10.0, \"R_b\": 50e-6},\n        {\"model\": \"open\", \"species\": \"Ar\", \"h\": 0.0, \"R_b\": 1e-6},\n        {\"model\": \"open\", \"species\": \"Ne\", \"h\": 100.0, \"R_b\": 100e-6}\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        delta = 0.0\n        if case[\"model\"] == \"closed\":\n            # --- Closed-System Model Calculation ---\n            # delta = - (phi_b / (kH*R*T)) / (1 + phi_b / (kH*R*T))\n            phi_b = case[\"phi_b\"]\n            if phi_b == 0.0:\n                delta = 0.0\n            else:\n                kH = GAS_PROPERTIES[case[\"species\"]][\"kH\"]\n                R = CONSTANTS[\"R\"]\n                T = CONSTANTS[\"T\"]\n                # Ostwald coefficient (dimensionless)\n                ostwald_coeff = kH * R * T\n                term = phi_b / ostwald_coeff\n                delta = -term / (1.0 + term)\n\n        elif case[\"model\"] == \"open\":\n            # --- Open-System Model Calculation ---\n            # delta = (rho*g*h + 2*gamma/R_b) / P_atm\n            P_atm = CONSTANTS[\"P_atm\"]\n            \n            # Hydrostatic pressure\n            P_hyd = CONSTANTS[\"rho\"] * CONSTANTS[\"g\"] * case[\"h\"]\n            \n            # Laplace pressure\n            P_laplace = (2 * CONSTANTS[\"gamma\"]) / case[\"R_b\"]\n            \n            # Pressure excess\n            P_excess = P_hyd + P_laplace\n            \n            delta = P_excess / P_atm\n        \n        results.append(f\"{delta:.6f}\")\n\n    # --- Print final output in the required format ---\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results)}]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n\n```",
