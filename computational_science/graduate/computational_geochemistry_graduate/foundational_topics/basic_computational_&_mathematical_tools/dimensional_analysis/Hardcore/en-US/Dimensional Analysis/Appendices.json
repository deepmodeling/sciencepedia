Report $S$ rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically sound. The governing equation is the one-dimensional advection-diffusion-reaction equation, a fundamental and widely used model in environmental and earth system sciences for describing solute transport. The concepts of dimensional analysis and characteristic scales are standard tools for analyzing such equations. All required parameters ($L, U, D, k$) are provided, and their values are physically realistic for a riverine system. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins by determining the dimensions of the relevant parameters. Let $\\mathrm{L}$ denote length and $\\mathrm{T}$ denote time.\n- Reach length $L$: $[L] = \\mathrm{L}$\n- Flow speed $U$: $[U] = \\mathrm{L\\,T}^{-1}$\n- Dispersion coefficient $D$: $[D] = \\mathrm{L}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}$\n- Decay rate constant $k$: $[k] = \\mathrm{T}^{-1}$\n\nWe construct the characteristic time scales by considering the physical meaning of each process and balancing terms in the governing equation. A characteristic time scale for a process is the time required for that process to cause a significant change in the system over a characteristic length scale, which is the reach length $L$.\n\n**1. Advection Time Scale ($T_A$)**\nAdvection is the transport of solute by the bulk flow. The characteristic advective time scale, $T_A$, is the time it takes for a parcel of water to travel the entire length of the reach, $L$, at the mean flow speed, $U$. Based on the fundamental definition of velocity (distance/time), we have:\n$$\nT_A = \\frac{L}{U}\n$$\nThe dimensions are $[\\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{L\\,T}^{-1}}] = \\mathrm{T}$, which is consistent.\n\n**2. Diffusion Time Scale ($T_D$)**\nDiffusion (or more accurately, longitudinal dispersion in a river context) is the process by which solute spreads out from regions of high concentration to low concentration. The characteristic time for this process, $T_D$, over the length scale $L$ can be derived by a scaling analysis of the pure diffusion equation, $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}$. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ be a characteristic concentration. The terms scale as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} \\sim \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{T_D} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} \\sim D \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{L^2}\n$$\nFor the process to be significant, these two scales must be of the same order of magnitude:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{T_D} \\sim D \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{L^2} \\implies T_D = \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThe dimensions are $[\\frac{\\mathrm{L}^2}{\\mathrm{L}^2\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}}] = \\mathrm{T}$, which is consistent. This time scale represents the time required for diffusive effects to become important across the entire length of the reach.\n\n**3. Reaction Time Scale ($T_R$)**\nThe first-order reaction describes the decay of the solute. The characteristic time scale for reaction, $T_R$, is the time over which a significant fraction of the solute decays. This is derived from the pure decay equation, $\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC$. The solution is $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$, where the time constant of the exponential decay is $1/k$. Therefore, the characteristic time scale is:\n$$\nT_R = \\frac{1}{k}\n$$\nThis represents the e-folding lifetime of the solute. The dimensions are $[\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{T}^{-1}}] = \\mathrm{T}$, which is consistent.\n\n### Computation of Time Scales and Dominance Spread\n\nNext, we calculate the numerical values of these time scales using the provided parameters. First, we ensure all values are in consistent SI units (meters and seconds).\n- $L = 20\\,\\mathrm{km} = 2.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $U = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $D = 40\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $k = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe time scales are computed as follows:\n$$\nT_A = \\frac{L}{U} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.3\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{20}{3} \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 6.6667 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\nT_D = \\frac{L^2}{D} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{40\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{m}^2}{40\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n$$\nT_R = \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{1}{2.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.5 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s} = 5.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\n\nNow, we compare their magnitudes to determine the largest and smallest time scales. A smaller time scale indicates a faster, more dominant process over the given length scale.\n- $T_A \\approx 6.67 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $T_R = 5.0 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $T_D = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nComparing these values, we find:\n- Smallest time scale: $T_{\\mathrm{min}} = T_A = \\frac{20}{3} \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Largest time scale: $T_{\\mathrm{max}} = T_D = 1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThis indicates that over the $20\\,\\mathrm{km}$ reach, advection is the fastest process, followed by reaction, and dispersion is the slowest process.\n\nThe dominance spread $S$ is the ratio of the largest to the smallest characteristic time scale:\n$$\nS = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{max}}}{T_{\\mathrm{min}}} = \\frac{T_D}{T_A} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{s}}{\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^4}{0.3}\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^7) \\times 0.3}{2.0 \\times 10^4}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\frac{0.3 \\times 10^3}{2.0} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150\n$$\nThe value of $S$ is exactly $150$. The problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. Therefore, we write $150$ as $150.0$.",

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe one-dimensional mass conservation law in a porous medium with porosity $n$ is given by:\n$$\nn \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J_{\\text{total}}}{\\partial x} - n R\n$$\nwhere $J_{\\text{total}} = J_{\\text{adv}} + J_{\\text{disp}}$ is the total flux and $R$ is the reaction rate per unit volume of fluid. Given the definitions, $J_{\\text{total}} = n v C - n D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$ and $R=kC$. Since $v=q/n$, we have $J_{\\text{total}} = q C - n D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$. Substituting this into the conservation law and dividing by the constant porosity $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} + D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - k C\n$$\nThis is the Advection-Dispersion-Reaction Equation (ADRE).\n\nTo non-dimensionalize, we select characteristic scales for length, time, and concentration. The problem is to predict concentration at the observation well, so the natural characteristic length scale is the distance to the well, $L = L_{\\text{plume}}$. The characteristic time scale for an advection-dominated system is the advective travel time, $T = L/v$. Let $x' = x/L$, $t' = t/T = t v/L$, and $C' = C/C_0$, where $C_0$ is a reference concentration. Substituting these dimensionless variables into the ADRE yields:\n$$\n\\frac{v}{L}\\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t'} = -v \\frac{1}{L}\\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial x'} + D \\frac{1}{L^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 C'}{\\partial (x')^2} - k C'\n$$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $L/v$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial t'} = - \\frac{\\partial C'}{\\partial x'} + \\left(\\frac{D}{vL}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 C'}{\\partial (x')^2} - \\left(\\frac{kL}{v}\\right) C'\n$$\nFrom this, we identify the standard dimensionless groups:\n-   **Péclet number ($Pe$)**: $Pe = \\frac{vL}{D}$, which is the ratio of advective to dispersive transport rates.\n-   **Damköhler number ($Da$)**: $Da = \\frac{kL}{v}$, which is the ratio of the advective transport time scale ($L/v$) to the reaction time scale ($1/k$).\n\n**Numerical Calculations**\nFirst, we calculate the pore-water velocity $v$ and the dispersion coefficient $D$:\n$$\nv = \\frac{q}{n} = \\frac{1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{0.30} \\approx 3.333 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n$$\nD = \\alpha_L v + D_m = (5\\ \\mathrm{m})(3.333 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) + 1.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\n$$\nD = 1.667 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} + 1.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} \\approx 1.667 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}\n$$\nThe mechanical dispersion term $\\alpha_L v$ is more than five orders of magnitude larger than the molecular diffusion term $D_m$, so $D \\approx \\alpha_L v$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Using $L=L_{\\text{plume}}$, with $v=q/n$ and $D=\\alpha_L v + D_m$, one finds $Pe\\approx 200$ and $Da\\approx 30$. This choice of $L$ is physically consistent for predicting breakthrough at $x=L_{\\text{plume}}$ because advection sets the travel time over the plume scale, and dispersion is dominated by $\\alpha_L v$ at the given velocity.**\n\n-   **Choice of L**: For predicting the fate and transport over a distance $L_{\\text{plume}}$, the characteristic length of the system is indeed $L = L_{\\text{plume}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{m}$. This choice is physically consistent.\n-   **Calculations**:\n    $$\n    Pe = \\frac{v L_{\\text{plume}}}{D} = \\frac{(3.333 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s})(1000\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.667 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}} \\approx 199.98 \\approx 200\n    $$\n    Alternatively, since $D \\approx \\alpha_L v$, we have $Pe \\approx \\frac{v L_{\\text{plume}}}{\\alpha_L v} = \\frac{L_{\\text{plume}}}{\\alpha_L} = \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{m}}{5\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 200$.\n    $$\n    Da = \\frac{k L_{\\text{plume}}}{v} = \\frac{(1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(1000\\ \\mathrm{m})}{3.333 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 30\n    $$\n-   **Physical Argument**: The calculations are correct. The argument is also correct. The characteristic length should match the scale of the observation. The high $Pe$ value confirms that transport is advection-dominated, which also implies that mechanical dispersion ($\\alpha_L v$) is the dominant spreading mechanism over molecular diffusion ($D_m$), as correctly stated.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Using $L=\\ell_c$, with $v=q/n$ and $D=\\alpha_L v + D_m$, one finds $Pe\\approx 2$ and $Da\\approx 0.3$. This choice of $L$ is physically consistent even when predicting breakthrough at $x=L_{\\text{plume}}$ because local mixing at the heterogeneity scale dominates the plume-scale attenuation.**\n\n-   **Choice of L**: The correlation length $\\ell_c$ represents the scale of local heterogeneities. While it's a crucial parameter influencing the effective dispersivity $\\alpha_L$, it is not the characteristic length for the overall, plume-scale transport problem, which is defined by the travel distance $L_{\\text{plume}}$. Hence, the choice $L = \\ell_c = 10\\ \\mathrm{m}$ is inappropriate for predicting breakthrough at $1000\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n-   **Calculations**:\n    $$\n    Pe = \\frac{v \\ell_c}{D} \\approx \\frac{\\ell_c}{\\alpha_L} = \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{m}}{5\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 2\n    $$\n    $$\n    Da = \\frac{k \\ell_c}{v} = \\frac{(1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(10\\ \\mathrm{m})}{3.333 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 0.3\n    $$\n-   **Physical Argument**: While the calculations are correct for the chosen $L$, the physical justification is flawed. Local mixing contributes to the overall effective dispersion, but the attenuation seen at the plume scale integrates processes over the full length $L_{\\text{plume}}$. Using $\\ell_c$ as the global scaling length is a conceptual error.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Using $L=L_{\\text{plume}}$ but $Da$ defined with the Darcy flux as $Da = k\\,L_{\\text{plume}}/q$, while $Pe$ computed with $v=q/n$ and $D=\\alpha_L v + D_m$, one finds $Pe\\approx 200$ and $Da\\approx 100$. This is physically consistent because plume-scale attenuation should be referenced to the Darcy flux rather than the pore velocity.**\n\n-   **Choice of L and Definitions**: This option mixes definitions. The Damköhler number must compare the timescale of transport with the timescale of reaction. The solute travels with the pore-water velocity $v$, not the Darcy flux $q$. Therefore, the correct transport timescale is $L_{\\text{plume}}/v$. Using $L_{\\text{plume}}/q$ is physically incorrect as it ignores the pore space through which the solute actually moves.\n-   **Calculations**:\n    The $Pe$ calculation is the same as in A, yielding $Pe \\approx 200$.\n    $$\n    Da = \\frac{k L_{\\text{plume}}}{q} = \\frac{(1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(1000\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.0\\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 100\n    $$\n-   **Physical Argument**: The calculations are arithmetically correct based on the flawed definition. The justification is incorrect; attenuation is a function of the time the solute spends traveling, which is determined by $v$, not $q$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Using $L=L_{\\text{plume}}$ but taking $D=D_m$ (neglecting hydrodynamic dispersion), with $v=q/n$, one finds $Pe\\approx 3.3\\times 10^{7}$ and $Da\\approx 30$. This is physically consistent because molecular diffusion is the fundamental mixing mechanism, so hydrodynamic dispersion can be neglected at the given flow.**\n\n-   **Choice of D**: This option proposes to neglect hydrodynamic dispersion, i.e., $D \\approx D_m$. As calculated earlier, $\\alpha_L v \\approx 1.667 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$ while $D_m = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}$. The hydrodynamic dispersion term is over $10^5$ times larger. Neglecting it is a gross error for a system with significant flow velocity.\n-   **Calculations**:\n    $Da$ is independent of $D$ and is correctly calculated as $30$.\n    $$\n    Pe = \\frac{v L_{\\text{plume}}}{D_m} = \\frac{(3.333 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s})(1000\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}} \\approx 3.33 \\times 10^7\n    $$\n-   **Physical Argument**: The assumption is physically baseless. While molecular diffusion is a fundamental process, at Péclet numbers greater than unity, mechanical mixing due to velocity variations in pore channels (hydrodynamic dispersion) dominates. The argument provided is contrary to established theory and observation in porous media flow.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Using $L=L_{\\text{plume}}$ and defining $Da$ against a diffusive time scale as $Da = k\\,L_{\\text{plume}}^{2}/D$, with $v=q/n$ and $D=\\alpha_L v + D_m$, one finds $Pe\\approx 200$ and $Da\\approx 6.0\\times 10^{3}$. This is physically consistent for first-order decay because diffusion controls the time scale at which reactions compete with transport on the plume scale.**\n\n-   **Choice of Da definition**: This option uses the so-called second Damköhler number, $Da_{II} = k L^2 / D$. This number compares the reaction timescale ($1/k$) to the diffusive transport timescale ($L^2/D$). This is relevant only in systems where diffusion/dispersion is the dominant transport mechanism (i.e., $Pe \\ll 1$).\n-   **Calculations**:\n    $Pe$ is correctly given as $\\approx 200$.\n    $$\n    Da = \\frac{k L_{\\text{plume}}^2}{D} = \\frac{(1.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(1000\\ \\mathrm{m})^2}{1.667 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{1}{1.667 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 5998.8 \\approx 6.0\\times 10^3\n    $$\n    Note that $Da_{II} = Pe \\times Da_I = 200 \\times 30 = 6000$.\n-   **Physical Argument**: The justification \"diffusion controls the time scale\" is directly contradicted by the large Péclet number ($Pe \\approx 200 \\gg 1$), which unequivocally indicates that advection controls the transport timescale. Therefore, comparing reaction rate to a diffusive timescale is physically inconsistent for characterizing the overall plume behavior.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOnly option A correctly identifies the appropriate characteristic length scale for the problem, uses the standard, physically meaningful definitions for the Péclet and Damköhler numbers in an advection-dominated system, performs the calculations correctly, and provides a sound physical justification.",
