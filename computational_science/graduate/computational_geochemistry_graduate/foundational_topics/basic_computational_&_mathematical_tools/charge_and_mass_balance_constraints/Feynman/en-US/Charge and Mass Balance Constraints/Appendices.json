This is a standard procedure in computational geochemistry to verify the quality of a water analysis.\n\nFirst, we must state the governing principle. The principle of electroneutrality asserts that for any macroscopic volume of an electrolyte solution, the sum of the molar concentrations of the positive charges must equal the sum of the molar concentrations of the negative charges. The net charge balance residual, which we denote as $R_{cb}$, is the quantitative expression of this principle. It is defined as the algebraic sum of the molar concentrations $M_i$ of each dissolved species $i$, each weighted by its integer charge (valence) $z_i$.\n\nThe formula for the charge balance residual is:\n$$R_{cb} = \\sum_{i} z_i M_i$$\nThe units of $R_{cb}$ are typically equivalents per liter, $\\text{eq}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}$.

Substituting this into the expression for $K_{a}$:\n$$K_{a} = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{C_{A} - [A^{-}]}$$\nRearranging to solve for $[A^{-}]$:\n$$K_{a}(C_{A} - [A^{-}]) = [H^{+}][A^{-}]$$\n$$K_{a}C_{A} - K_{a}[A^{-}] = [H^{+}][A^{-}]$$\n$$K_{a}C_{A} = [A^{-}]([H^{+}] + K_{a})$$\nThis yields the expression for the concentration of the conjugate base:\n$$[A^{-}] = \\frac{K_{a}C_{A}}{[H^{+}] + K_{a}}$$\n\nSecond, we write the charge-neutrality residual, $R_{\\text{charge}}(\\mathrm{pH})$, and derive its sensitivity with respect to $\\mathrm{pH}$, $\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}}$.\nThe charge-neutrality residual is the sum of the concentrations of all species, each multiplied by its charge number, $z_i$. The charged species in the solution are $H^{+}$ (charge $+1$), $OH^{-}$ (charge $-1$), $A^{-}$ (charge $-1$), the background cation (charge $+1$, concentration $C_{+}$), and the background anion (charge $-1$, concentration $C_{-}$).\n$$R_{\\text{charge}} = (+1)[H^{+}] + (-1)[OH^{-}] + (-1)[A^{-}] + (+1)C_{+} + (-1)C_{-}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $[OH^{-}]$ and $[A^{-}]$:\n$$R_{\\text{charge}}([H^{+}]) = [H^{+}] - \\frac{K_{w}}{[H^{+}]} - \\frac{K_{a}C_{A}}{[H^{+}] + K_{a}} + (C_{+} - C_{-})$$\nThe term $(C_{+} - C_{-})$ is a constant with respect to $\\mathrm{pH}$. To find the derivative $\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}}$, we use the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}} = \\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial [H^{+}]} \\frac{\\partial [H^{+}]}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}}$$\nFirst, we find the derivative of $[H^{+}]$ with respect to $\\mathrm{pH}$:\n$$[H^{+}] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} = \\exp(-\\mathrm{pH} \\cdot \\ln(10))$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial [H^{+}]}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}} = \\exp(-\\mathrm{pH} \\cdot \\ln(10)) \\cdot (-\\ln(10)) = -[H^{+}] \\ln(10)$$\nNext, we find the derivative of $R_{\\text{charge}}$ with respect to $[H^{+}]$:\n$$R_{\\text{charge}} = [H^{+}] - K_{w}[H^{+}]^{-1} - K_{a}C_{A}([H^{+}] + K_{a})^{-1} + (C_{+} - C_{-})$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial [H^{+}]} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial [H^{+}]} \\left( [H^{+}] - K_{w}[H^{+}]^{-1} - K_{a}C_{A}([H^{+}] + K_{a})^{-1} + (C_{+} - C_{-}) \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial [H^{+}]} = 1 - K_{w}(-1)[H^{+}]^{-2} - K_{a}C_{A}(-1)([H^{+}] + K_{a})^{-2}(1) + 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial [H^{+}]} = 1 + \\frac{K_{w}}{[H^{+}]^{2}} + \\frac{K_{a}C_{A}}{([H^{+}] + K_{a})^{2}}$$\nNow, we apply the chain rule by multiplying the two derivatives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}} = \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_{w}}{[H^{+}]^{2}} + \\frac{K_{a}C_{A}}{([H^{+}] + K_{a})^{2}} \\right) \\cdot (-[H^{+}] \\ln(10))$$\nDistributing the $-[H^{+}] \\ln(10)$ term:\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}} = -\\ln(10) \\left( [H^{+}] + \\frac{K_{w}}{[H^{+}]} + \\frac{[H^{+}]K_{a}C_{A}}{([H^{+}] + K_{a})^{2}} \\right)$$\nFinally, we substitute $[H^{+}] = 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}$ to express the derivative solely in terms of $\\mathrm{pH}$, $K_{w}$, $K_{a}$, and $C_{A}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}} = -\\ln(10) \\left( 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} + \\frac{K_{w}}{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}} + \\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}K_{a}C_{A}}{(10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} + K_{a})^{2}} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}} = -\\ln(10) \\left( 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} + K_{w}10^{\\mathrm{pH}} + \\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}K_{a}C_{A}}{(10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} + K_{a})^{2}} \\right)$$\n\nThird, we briefly discuss the implications for the Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm. The NR iteration for solving $R_{\\text{charge}}(\\mathrm{pH}) = 0$ is given by:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{n+1} = \\mathrm{pH}_{n} - \\frac{R_{\\text{charge}}(\\mathrm{pH}_n)}{\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}}|_{\\mathrm{pH}_n}}$$\nTo analyze convergence, we examine the sign and behavior of the derivative, $\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}}$.\nThe term $\\ln(10)$ is positive. The expression in the parentheses is a sum of three terms:\n1. $10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} = [H^{+}]$, which is always positive.\n2. $K_{w}10^{\\mathrm{pH}} = K_{w}/[H^{+}] = [OH^{-}]$, which is always positive as $K_w > 0$.\n3. $\\frac{10^{-\\mathrm{pH}}K_{a}C_{A}}{(10^{-\\mathrm{pH}} + K_{a})^{2}}$. Since $K_{a} > 0$ and $C_{A} \\ge 0$, this term is non-negative.\nFor any physically meaningful system where $C_A > 0$, the entire expression in the parentheses is strictly positive. Consequently, the derivative $\\frac{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial \\mathrm{pH}}$ is always negative.\nThis has several important implications for the NR method:\n- **Uniqueness of Solution:** Since the derivative is always negative, $R_{\\text{charge}}(\\mathrm{pH})$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function of $\\mathrm{pH}$. A monotonic function can cross the zero-axis at most once, which guarantees that if a physically meaningful solution for $\\mathrm{pH}$ exists, it is unique.\n- **Robust Convergence:** The NR update step, $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = -\\frac{R_{\\text{charge}}}{\\partial R_{\\text{charge}}/\\partial \\mathrm{pH}}$, will always have the same sign as the residual $R_{\\text{charge}}$, because the denominator is always negative. If the residual is positive (net positive charge), the pH update will be positive, correctly increasing the $\\mathrm{pH}$ towards the root. If the residual is negative, the pH update will be negative, correctly decreasing the $\\mathrm{pH}$. The iteration always moves in the correct direction, which is highly favorable for convergence.\n- **No Singularities:** The derivative is never zero for any finite $\\mathrm{pH}$. This means the NR algorithm will not fail due to division by zero, a risk that exists if the iteration lands on a point where the function's slope is zero (a local extremum). The monotonic nature of the residual function precludes such extrema.",
