            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It poses a standard, non-trivial question in chemical kinetics and computational science, requiring a rigorous application of dimensional analysis. All necessary information is provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the principle of dimensional homogeneity, which mandates that each term in a valid physical equation must have the same dimensions. We are given the $n$th-order rate law for the consumption of a species with concentration $C$:\n$$r(t) = k(T)\\,C(t)^{n}$$\nwhere $r(t) = -\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}t}$.\n\nLet $[X]$ denote the dimensions of a quantity $X$. The problem specifies the base units for concentration and rate within the International System of Units (SI). Let the fundamental dimensions be amount of substance ($\\mathrm{N}$), length ($\\mathrm{L}$), and time ($\\mathrm{T}$).\nThe concentration $C$ is given in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, so its dimensions are:\n$$[C] = \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{L}^{3}} = \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-3}$$\nThe rate of consumption $r$ is given in units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, so its dimensions are:\n$$[r] = \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{L}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{T}} = \\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}$$\nApplying the principle of dimensional homogeneity to the rate law, we have:\n$$[r] = [k(T)]\\,[C]^{n}$$\nWe can solve for the dimensions of the rate coefficient, $[k(T)]$:\n$$[k(T)] = \\frac{[r]}{[C]^{n}}$$\nSubstituting the dimensions of $r$ and $C$:\n$$[k(T)] = \\frac{\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}}{(\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-3})^{n}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{N}^{n}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-3n}}$$\nBy applying the laws of exponents, we find the dimensions of $k(T)$:\n$$[k(T)] = \\mathrm{N}^{1-n}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-3 - (-3n)}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1} = \\mathrm{N}^{1-n}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{3n-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}$$\nNext, we consider the Arrhenius expression for the temperature dependence of the rate coefficient:\n$$k(T) = A\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)$$\nA fundamental mathematical principle is that the argument of any transcendental function, such as the exponential function $\\exp(x)$, must be dimensionless. We must verify this for the argument $-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}$. The problem provides the units for the quantities involved:\n-   Activation energy, $E_{a}$: $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n-   Universal gas constant, $R$: $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n-   Absolute temperature, $T$: $\\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe dimensions of the argument are therefore:\n$$\\left[\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}]}{[\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{K}]} = \\frac{\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}} = 1$$\nThe argument is indeed dimensionless, confirming the consistency of the Arrhenius expression. Since the exponential term $\\exp(-E_{a}/(RT))$ is a dimensionless factor, the dimensions of the rate coefficient $k(T)$ must be identical to the dimensions of the pre-exponential factor $A$.\n$$[A] = [k(T)] = \\mathrm{N}^{1-n}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{3n-3}\\,\\mathrm{T}^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the units of $A$ to be expressed in the form $\\mathrm{mol}^{\\alpha(n)}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{\\beta(n)}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{\\gamma(n)}$. By mapping the dimensional symbols back to their corresponding SI base units ($\\mathrm{N} \\to \\mathrm{mol}$, $\\mathrm{L} \\to \\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{T} \\to \\mathrm{s}$), we can identify the exponents:\n-   The exponent of moles ($\\mathrm{mol}$) is $\\alpha(n) = 1 - n$.\n-   The exponent of meters ($\\mathrm{m}$) is $\\beta(n) = 3n - 3$.\n-   The exponent of seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$) is $\\gamma(n) = -1$.\n\nThis completes the derivation of the dimensional exponents.\n\nThe second part of the task is to articulate a rigorous procedure for verifying unit consistency in computational geochemistry simulations, especially for non-integer reaction order $n$. Such a procedure can be implemented as a pre-simulation check to prevent errors arising from inconsistent physical units.\n\nA rigorous procedure is as follows:\n1.  **Establish Base Unit System:** Define the base units for the fundamental dimensions required by the model. For this problem, these are amount of substance ($\\mathrm{U_{N}}$), length ($\\mathrm{U_{L}}$), and time ($\\mathrm{U_{T}}$). In the context of the problem, these are $\\mathrm{mol}$, $\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\mathrm{s}$, respectively.\n2.  **Declare Input Parameter Units:** For a given reaction, the simulation code must have access to the declared units of all relevant input parameters:\n    -   Concentration $C$: unit $[C]_{decl}$.\n    -   Rate $r$: unit $[r]_{decl}$.\n    -   Activation energy $E_a$: unit $[E_a]_{decl}$.\n    -   Gas constant $R$: unit $[R]_{decl}$.\n    -   Temperature $T$: unit $[T]_{decl}$.\n    -   Pre-exponential factor $A$: unit $[A]_{decl}$.\n    -   Reaction order $n$ (a dimensionless scalar).\n3.  **Verify Dimensionless Exponential Argument:** Construct the unit expression for the argument of the Arrhenius exponential, $\\frac{[E_a]_{decl}}{[R]_{decl} \\cdot [T]_{decl}}$. Algebraically simplify this expression. The final result must be dimensionless (i.e., equivalent to $1$). If not, the simulation must be halted with a unit inconsistency error for the thermodynamic parameters.\n4.  **Derive Required Units for the Pre-exponential Factor:** Based on the $n$th-order rate law, derive the dimensionally-correct units for the rate coefficient $k$, and therefore for $A$. This is the core of the verification. The required unit for $A$ is $[A]_{req} = \\frac{[r]_{decl}}{([C]_{decl})^{n}}$. This expression is evaluated by substituting the declared units of rate and concentration. For the given problem, this would be:\n    $$[A]_{req} = \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})^{n}} = (\\mathrm{mol})^{1-n}\\,(\\mathrm{m})^{3n-3}\\,(\\mathrm{s})^{-1}$$\n    This step is valid for any real number $n$, as dimensional analysis permits non-integer exponents on units.\n5.  **Compare and Validate:** Compare the declared unit of the pre-exponential factor, $[A]_{decl}$, with the required unit, $[A]_{req}$, derived in the previous step. The two must be identical. If $[A]_{decl} \\neq [A]_{req}$, the kinetic parameters are inconsistent with the specified rate law, and the simulation must be halted with an error message indicating the discrepancy. For instance, if $n=2$, the required units for $A$ are $(\\mathrm{mol})^{-1}\\,(\\mathrm{m})^{3}\\,(\\mathrm{s})^{-1}$. If the user provides $A$ with any other units, the check fails.\n6.  **Confirmation with Rate Law:** As a final check, the internal consistency can be confirmed by ensuring that $[A]_{req} \\cdot ([C]_{decl})^{n}$ simplifies exactly to $[r]_{decl}$. This step is algorithmically equivalent to Step 4 but serves as a robust verification of the derivation itself.\n\nThis procedure provides a complete, automatable, and rigorous method for ensuring dimensional consistency in rate calculations within a computational geochemistry framework before any numerical integration is performed.",

            "problem": "A computational geochemistry laboratory has measured surface-normalized calcite precipitation rates under controlled aqueous conditions at multiple temperatures and saturation states. The precipitation rate depends on temperature $T$ (in $\\mathrm{K}$) through an activated process with an energy barrier, and on the saturation state $\\Omega$ through a nonlinear supersaturation response. The saturation state $\\Omega$ is defined as the ratio of the ion activity product to the solubility product of calcite, and thus $\\Omega \\gt 1$ denotes supersaturation. The objective is to estimate the activation energy $E_a$ while explicitly accounting for the nonlinearity in $\\Omega$.\n\nStarting from fundamental statistical mechanics, use the Boltzmann distribution to model the fraction of configurations that can cross an energy barrier. Justify a separability assumption in which the temperature dependence and the supersaturation dependence factorize into a product of two functions. Adopt a monotone response function of supersaturation that can be modeled by a power of the supersaturation distance from equilibrium, and justify the use of a logarithmic transformation to linearize the estimation problem. Your program must:\n\n- Derive a regression model from first principles that isolates $E_a$ using the fraction of configurations above an energy threshold and a parametric nonlinear function of $\\Omega$.\n- Implement an estimation routine that, given arrays of $(T_i, \\Omega_i)$ and measured rates $r_i$ (in $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$), returns estimates of three parameters:\n  - the activation energy $E_a$ (expressed in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$),\n  - the supersaturation nonlinearity exponent $n$ (dimensionless),\n  - a pre-exponential coefficient $A$ (with units $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$).\n- Use the Ideal Gas Constant, $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and statistical mechanics, well-posed as a parameter estimation problem, and specified with all necessary data and constraints for a unique solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and implementation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the activation energy $E_a$, a pre-exponential factor $A$, and a nonlinearity exponent $n$ from experimental rate data. The precipitation rate, $r$, is a function of absolute temperature, $T$, and the calcite saturation state, $\\Omega$. The problem suggests a model where the dependencies on temperature and saturation are separable. This is a common and physically reasonable assumption, leading to a rate law of the form:\n$$\nr(T, \\Omega) = f(T) \\cdot g(\\Omega)\n$$\nwhere $f(T)$ captures the temperature dependence and $g(\\Omega)$ captures the dependence on supersaturation.\n\n**1. Temperature Dependence, $f(T)$**\n\nThe temperature dependence is stated to arise from an activated process. According to statistical mechanics and the Boltzmann distribution, the fraction of molecules in a system possessing at least a minimum molar energy $E_a$ (the activation energy) at a given temperature $T$ is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, $e^{-E_a / (RT)}$. Here, $R$ is the ideal gas constant. This is the cornerstone of the Arrhenius equation. We thus model the temperature-dependent part of the rate constant as:\n$$\nf(T) \\propto e^{-E_a / (RT)}\n$$\n\n**2. Supersaturation Dependence, $g(\\Omega)$**\n\nThe problem specifies that the supersaturation dependence, $g(\\Omega)$, should be modeled as a power of the supersaturation distance from equilibrium. The saturation state $\\Omega$ is defined as the ratio of the ion activity product to the solubility product. Equilibrium corresponds to $\\Omega=1$. For precipitation to occur, the system must be supersaturated, i.e., $\\Omega > 1$. The \"distance from equilibrium\" can be quantified as $(\\Omega - 1)$. A general nonlinear response can then be modeled as a power law:\n$$\ng(\\Omega) \\propto (\\Omega - 1)^n\n$$\nwhere $n$ is a dimensionless exponent that describes the order of the reaction with respect to the supersaturation driving force.\n\n**3. Combined Rate Law**\n\nCombining these two dependencies and introducing a single pre-exponential factor, $A$, which consolidates all proportionality constants, we obtain the complete rate law:\n$$\nr(T, \\Omega) = A \\cdot e^{-E_a / (RT)} \\cdot (\\Omega - 1)^n\n$$\nThe parameters to be estimated from the experimental data $(T_i, \\Omega_i, r_i)$ are $A$, $E_a$, and $n$.\n\n**4. Linearization for Parameter Estimation**\n\nThis model is nonlinear in its parameters $E_a$ and $n$, which complicates direct fitting. As suggested, we can linearize the equation by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(r) = \\ln\\left(A \\cdot e^{-E_a / (RT)} \\cdot (\\Omega - 1)^n\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(xy) = \\ln(x) + \\ln(y)$ and $\\ln(x^p) = p\\ln(x)$, we expand the expression:\n$$\n\\ln(r) = \\ln(A) + \\ln\\left(e^{-E_a / (RT)}\\right) + \\ln\\left((\\Omega - 1)^n\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(r) = \\ln(A) - \\frac{E_a}{RT} + n \\ln(\\Omega - 1)\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into the form of a multiple linear regression model, $Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2$. We make the following identifications for a given data point $i$:\n- The response variable: $Y_i = \\ln(r_i)$\n- The predictor variables: $X_{i,1} = \\frac{1}{T_i}$ and $X_{i,2} = \\ln(\\Omega_i - 1)$\n- The regression coefficients: $\\beta_0 = \\ln(A)$, $\\beta_1 = -\\frac{E_a}{R}$, and $\\beta_2 = n$.\n\nThe linearized model is:\n$$\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{i,1} + \\beta_2 X_{i,2} + \\epsilon_i\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_i$ represents the residual error for the $i$-th measurement.\n\n**5. Solving via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**\n\nThe vector of coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2]^T$ can be estimated by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. This is the method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The OLS solution is given by the normal equations:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{Y}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{Y}$ is the vector of observed responses $[Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_m]^T$ and $\\mathbf{X}$ is the $m \\times 3$ design matrix. Each row of $\\mathbf{X}$ corresponds to an experimental data point and has the form $[1, X_{i,1}, X_{i,2}]$, where the initial $1$ accounts for the intercept term $\\beta_0$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1/T_1 & \\ln(\\Omega_1 - 1) \\\\\n1 & 1/T_2 & \\ln(\\Omega_2 - 1) \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & 1/T_m & \\ln(\\Omega_m - 1)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n, \\quad\n\\mathbf{Y} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\ln(r_1) \\\\\n\\ln(r_2) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\ln(r_m)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis system will be solved numerically using standard linear algebra routines, such as those provided in `numpy.linalg`.\n\n**6. Recovering Physical Parameters**\n\nOnce the regression coefficients $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$, and $\\beta_2$ are determined, the physical parameters of the model are recovered as follows:\n- Pre-exponential factor: $A = e^{\\beta_0}$\n- Activation energy: $E_a = -\\beta_1 \\cdot R$. Given $R$ in $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $E_a$ will be in $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$. To express it in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, we divide by $1000$: $E_a\\ [\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}] = \\frac{-\\beta_1 \\cdot R}{1000}$.\n- Nonlinearity exponent: $n = \\beta_2$\n\nThe implementation will process each of the four test cases by constructing the respective $\\mathbf{X}$ and $\\mathbf{Y}$ matrices, solving for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$, and then calculating and rounding the physical parameters $E_a$, $n$, and $A$ to three significant figures.",

            "problem": "You are studying a geochemical reaction system where the temperature dependence of the reaction rate constant arises from a barrier-crossing process. Based on equilibrium statistical mechanics and kinetic theory, the fraction of molecules with energy at least equal to a barrier can be derived from the Boltzmann factor, which implies that the number of successful barrier crossings per unit time depends exponentially on the barrier energy and inversely on the absolute temperature. Consider a calibration measurement of the reaction rate constant at an absolute temperature $T_{\\text{cal}}$, with a measured calibration rate constant $k_{\\text{cal}}$ that is treated as exact for the purposes of this analysis. The barrier height is the activation energy $E_a$, which is uncertain due to experimental fitting and is modeled as a normal random variable with mean $\\mu_{E_a}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{E_a}$. The activation energy $E_a$ is given per mole, and the relevant thermal energy scale is determined by the universal gas constant $R$. Starting from the Boltzmann population and collision-frequency picture, derive the dependence of the rate constant on activation energy and temperature, and use the calibration measurement at $T_{\\text{cal}}$ to eliminate any unknown frequency factor so that the predicted rate at another temperature $T_{\\text{out}}$ depends only on $k_{\\text{cal}}$, $E_a$, $T_{\\text{cal}}$, and $T_{\\text{out}}$. Then, assuming $E_a \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{E_a},\\sigma_{E_a}^2)$, analytically propagate the uncertainty to the predicted rate constant at $T_{\\text{out}}$ and compute the distribution’s mean, median, and central $95$ percent interval.\n\nUse the following constants and units:\n- Use the universal gas constant $R = 8.31446261815324\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n- All absolute temperatures must be specified and used in $\\mathrm{K}$.\n- All activation energies must be specified in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ but converted internally to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$ for computation.\n- All rate constants must be computed and reported in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n- Express interval bounds and summary statistics as decimal numbers; do not use a percent sign.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The calibration rate constant $k_{\\text{cal}}$ at $T_{\\text{cal}}$ is treated as exact.\n- The only source of uncertainty is the activation energy $E_a$, modeled as $E_a \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{E_a},\\sigma_{E_a}^2)$.\n\nRequired outputs for each test case:\n- Compute the predicted rate constant distribution at $T_{\\text{out}}$, and return a list of four numbers: the distribution mean, the distribution median, the lower bound of the central $95$ percent interval, and the upper bound of the central $95$ percent interval.

            "solution": "The user provides a problem in computational geochemistry that requires deriving and applying a form of the Arrhenius equation to propagate uncertainty. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Rate Constant Relationship\nThe problem is based on the Arrhenius equation, which describes the temperature dependence of a reaction rate constant, $k$:\n$$\nk(T) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $A$ is the pre-exponential factor, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nA calibration measurement provides the rate constant $k_{\\text{cal}}$ at a specific temperature $T_{\\text{cal}}$. This measurement is treated as exact.\n$$\nk_{\\text{cal}} = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_{\\text{cal}}}\\right)\n$$\nWe can solve this equation for the unknown pre-exponential factor $A$:\n$$\nA = k_{\\text{cal}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{RT_{\\text{cal}}}\\right)\n$$\nTo predict the rate constant $k_{\\text{out}}$ at a different temperature $T_{\\text{out}}$, we substitute this expression for $A$ back into the general Arrhenius equation:\n$$\nk_{\\text{out}} = k(T_{\\text{out}}) = \\left( k_{\\text{cal}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{RT_{\\text{cal}}}\\right) \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_{\\text{out}}}\\right)\n$$\nCombining the exponential terms yields the desired relationship, which eliminates the pre-exponential factor:\n$$\nk_{\\text{out}} = k_{\\text{cal}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{RT_{\\text{cal}}} - \\frac{E_a}{RT_{\\text{out}}}\\right) = k_{\\text{cal}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_a}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{cal}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{out}}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Uncertainty Propagation\nThe activation energy $E_a$ is the sole source of uncertainty and is modeled as a normal random variable: $E_a \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{E_a}, \\sigma_{E_a}^2)$. Our goal is to determine the distribution of $k_{\\text{out}}$ that results from this uncertainty.\n\nLet us define a constant $b$ that encapsulates the temperature dependence:\n$$\nb = \\frac{1}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{cal}}} - \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{out}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe expression for $k_{\\text{out}}$ becomes:\n$$\nk_{\\text{out}} = k_{\\text{cal}} \\exp(b E_a)\n$$\nSince $E_a$ is a normal random variable, the exponent $b E_a$ is also a normal random variable. Let $X = E_a$. The random variable $Y = k_{\\text{out}}$ is of the form $c \\exp(\\text{Normal variable})$, which defines a log-normal distribution.\n\nTo find the parameters of this distribution, we take the natural logarithm of $k_{\\text{out}}$:\n$$\n\\ln(k_{\\text{out}}) = \\ln(k_{\\text{cal}}) + b E_a\n$$\nSince $\\ln(k_{\\text{cal}})$ is a constant (as $k_{\\text{cal}}$ is exact) and $E_a$ is a normal random variable, $\\ln(k_{\\text{out}})$ is also normally distributed. Let's find its mean and variance.\nThe mean of $\\ln(k_{\\text{out}})$ is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\ln k} = E[\\ln(k_{\\text{out}})] = E[\\ln(k_{\\text{cal}}) + b E_a] = \\ln(k_{\\text{cal}}) + b E[E_a] = \\ln(k_{\\text{cal}}) + b \\mu_{E_a}\n$$\nThe variance of $\\ln(k_{\\text{out}})$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\ln k}^2 = \\text{Var}[\\ln(k_{\\text{out}})] = \\text{Var}[\\ln(k_{\\text{cal}}) + b E_a] = b^2 \\text{Var}[E_a] = b^2 \\sigma_{E_a}^2\n$$\nThus, $\\ln(k_{\\text{out}}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\ln k}, \\sigma_{\\ln k}^2)$, which means $k_{\\text{out}}$ follows a log-normal distribution, $k_{\\text{out}} \\sim \\text{LogNormal}(\\mu_{\\ln k}, \\sigma_{\\ln k}^2)$.\n\n### Step 3: Computation of Statistical Properties\nFor a random variable $Y \\sim \\text{LogNormal}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, where $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$ are the mean and variance of $\\ln(Y)$, the mean, median, and quantiles are given by standard formulas.\n\n1.  **Mean**: The mean of $k_{\\text{out}}$ is given by:\n    $$\n    E[k_{\\text{out}}] = \\exp\\left(\\mu_{\\ln k} + \\frac{\\sigma_{\\ln k}^2}{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left( \\ln(k_{\\text{cal}}) + b\\mu_{E_a} + \\frac{(b\\sigma_{E_a})^2}{2} \\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    E[k_{\\text{out}}] = k_{\\text{cal}} \\exp\\left(b\\mu_{E_a} + \\frac{b^2\\sigma_{E_a}^2}{2}\\right)\n    $$\n\n2.  **Median**: The median of $k_{\\text{out}}$ is:\n    $$\n    \\text{Median}[k_{\\text{out}}] = \\exp(\\mu_{\\ln k}) = \\exp(\\ln(k_{\\text{cal}}) + b\\mu_{E_a}) = k_{\\text{cal}} \\exp(b\\mu_{E_a})\n    $$\n    This is the deterministic value of $k_{\\text{out}}$ evaluated at the mean activation energy, $\\mu_{E_a}$.\n\n3.  **Central 95% Interval**: The interval is found by transforming the corresponding interval for the underlying normal distribution, $\\ln(k_{\\text{out}})$. For a central $95\\%$ interval, we need the $2.5$-th and $97.5$-th percentiles. Let $z_p$ be the $p$-th quantile of the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The bounds are:\n    $$\n    \\text{Lower Bound, } \\ell = \\exp(\\mu_{\\ln k} + z_{0.025} \\sigma_{\\ln k})\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\text{Upper Bound, } u = \\exp(\\mu_{\\ln k} + z_{0.975} \\sigma_{\\ln k})\n    $$\n    where $z_{0.025} = -z_{0.975} \\approx -1.959964$, and $\\sigma_{\\ln k} = |b|\\sigma_{E_a}$.\n\n### Special Cases\n-   If $T_{\\text{cal}} = T_{\\text{out}}$, then $b=0$. The predicted rate $k_{\\text{out}} = k_{\\text{cal}}$ is a deterministic constant. Consequently, the mean, median, and interval bounds are all equal to $k_{\\text{cal}}$.\n-   If $\\sigma_{E_a} = 0$, the activation energy is the deterministic value $\\mu_{E_a}$. Then $\\sigma_{\\ln k} = 0$, and the distribution collapses to a single point. The mean, median, and interval bounds are all equal to the deterministic prediction $k_{\\text{cal}} \\exp(b\\mu_{E_a})$.\n\nThe algorithm involves converting input energies from $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ to $\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$, calculating the constant $b$, determining the parameters $\\mu_{\\ln k}$ and $\\sigma_{\\ln k}$, and then applying the above formulas to find the mean, median, and interval bounds. All results are reported in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ rounded to eight significant digits.",
