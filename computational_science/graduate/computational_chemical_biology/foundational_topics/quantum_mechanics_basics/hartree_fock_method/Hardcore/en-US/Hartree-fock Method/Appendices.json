            "problem": "Consider a simplified model of a two-electron atom. The electrons are treated as non-interacting, and their single-particle spatial wavefunctions (orbitals) are given by $\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r})$ and $\\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r})$, corresponding to the ground and first excited energy levels, respectively. The single-particle spin wavefunctions for a spin-up state ($m_s = +1/2$) and a spin-down state ($m_s = -1/2$) are denoted by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively.\n\nYour task is to model a specific excited state of this atom. This state is known as a triplet state, characterized by the electronic configuration $(1s)^1(2s)^1$, where one electron occupies the $1s$ orbital and the other occupies the $2s$ orbital. Specifically, you must consider the case where the total spin projection along the z-axis is $M_S = +1$.\n\nConstruct the correctly antisymmetrized total wavefunction, $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, s_2)$, for this two-electron state. The variables $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$ represent the spatial coordinates of electron 1 and electron 2, while $s_1$ and $s_2$ represent their spin coordinates.

Provide the final expression in its fully expanded and simplified form.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the antisymmetrized wavefunction for a two-electron system in a specific state. For a system of fermions like electrons, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two particles. The Slater determinant is the standard mathematical tool for constructing such wavefunctions from single-particle states.\n\nFirst, we must identify the single-particle states, or spin-orbitals, that are occupied by the two electrons. A spin-orbital is a product of a spatial orbital and a spin function. The state is described by the configuration $(1s)^1(2s)^1$, meaning one electron is in the spatial orbital $\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r})$ and the other is in $\\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the total spin projection is $M_S = +1$. The total spin projection is the sum of the individual spin projections, $M_S = m_{s1} + m_{s2}$. Since each electron can have $m_s = +1/2$ (spin-up, $\\alpha$) or $m_s = -1/2$ (spin-down, $\\beta$), the only way to achieve a total $M_S = +1$ is if both electrons are in the spin-up state: $m_{s1} = +1/2$ and $m_{s2} = +1/2$.\n\nTherefore, the two occupied spin-orbitals are:\n1.  $\\chi_a(\\mathbf{x}) = \\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r})\\alpha(s)$\n2.  $\\chi_b(\\mathbf{x}) = \\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r})\\alpha(s)$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{x}$ represents the combined space-spin coordinates $(\\mathbf{r}, s)$.\n\nNow, we construct the Slater determinant for a two-electron system ($N=2$) using these two spin-orbitals, $\\chi_a$ and $\\chi_b$. The general form is:\n$$ \\Psi(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N!}} \\begin{vmatrix} \\chi_a(\\mathbf{x}_1) & \\chi_b(\\mathbf{x}_1) \\\\ \\chi_a(\\mathbf{x}_2) & \\chi_b(\\mathbf{x}_2) \\end{vmatrix} $$\n\nFor our specific case with $N=2$:\n$$ \\Psi(\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2!}} \\begin{vmatrix} \\chi_a(\\mathbf{x}_1) & \\chi_b(\\mathbf{x}_1) \\\\ \\chi_a(\\mathbf{x}_2) & \\chi_b(\\mathbf{x}_2) \\end{vmatrix} $$\n\nLet's substitute the expressions for our spin-orbitals. The argument $\\mathbf{x}_1$ means we use coordinates $(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1)$ and $\\mathbf{x}_2$ means we use $(\\mathbf{r}_2, s_2)$.\n$$ \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, s_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{vmatrix} \\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\alpha(1) & \\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\alpha(1) \\\\ \\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\alpha(2) & \\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\alpha(2) \\end{vmatrix} $$\nHere, we have used the shorthand notation $\\alpha(1)$ for $\\alpha(s_1)$ and $\\alpha(2)$ for $\\alpha(s_2)$.\n\nNext, we expand the $2 \\times 2$ determinant, which is calculated as $(ad - bc)$:\n$$ \\Psi = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ (\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\alpha(1)) \\cdot (\\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\alpha(2)) - (\\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\alpha(1)) \\cdot (\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\alpha(2)) \\right] $$\n\nFinally, we simplify this expression by factoring out the common terms. The spin part, $\\alpha(1)\\alpha(2)$, is common to both terms in the subtraction.\n$$ \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, s_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left[ \\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r}_2) - \\psi_{2s}(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\psi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}_2) \\right] \\alpha(1)\\alpha(2) $$\n\nThis is the fully expanded and simplified form of the wavefunction. It is a product of a spatially antisymmetric part and a spin-symmetric part. The overall wavefunction is antisymmetric, as required for fermions.",
