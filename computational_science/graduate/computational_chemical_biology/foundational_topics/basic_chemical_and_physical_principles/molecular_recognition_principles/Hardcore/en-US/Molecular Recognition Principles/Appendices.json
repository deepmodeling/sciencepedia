This first practice invites you to build a model from the ground up, using fundamental principles of electrostatics to dissect two critical aromatic interactions: cation–$\\pi$ and $\\pi$–$\\pi$ stacking .

            "problem": "Aromatic recognition in biomolecular systems frequently involves face-to-ring interactions between cations and aromatic rings (cation–$\\pi$) and ring–ring contacts ($\\pi$–$\\pi$). Consider the following coarse-grained, continuum electrostatics and linear-response model designed to isolate the leading physical contributions from permanent moments and induced polarization while avoiding overlap and dispersion effects.\n\nAssume each aromatic ring is rigid, neutral, and possesses axial symmetry about its normal. It is characterized by a permanent traceless electric quadrupole tensor whose axial component is denoted by $Q$ (i.e., the symmetry axis is the $z$-axis through the ring center), and by a static linear polarizability for electric fields applied along the axis, denoted by $\\alpha$. The environment is vacuum with permittivity $\\varepsilon_0$. Neglect all short-range overlap, charge transfer, and London dispersion contributions; treat the interactions at separations large compared to the ring radius so that multipole expansion is valid.\n\nTwo recognition modes are to be compared:\n\n- Mode A (cation–$\\pi$): A monovalent cation of charge $q$ lies on the ring axis at a center-to-cation distance $z$. The ring’s permanent quadrupole interacts electrostatically with the cation, and the ring is polarized by the cation’s field along the axis. The cation is treated as a point charge.\n\n- Mode B ($\\pi$–$\\pi$ cofacial): Two identical aromatic rings are placed cofacially with parallel aligned axes and a center-to-center separation $d$. Each ring’s quadrupolar field polarizes the other along the common axis. Assume the rings’ permanent quadrupoles do not directly contribute a net electrostatic energy at this order (i.e., only induction is retained for Mode B under the stated approximations), and neglect any higher multipole or cross terms beyond leading induction from the axial quadrupole fields.\n\nStarting only from Coulomb’s law, the multipole expansion definition of the quadrupole potential, and the linear-response definition of induced dipole and its work of formation, derive a closed-form analytical expression for the interaction energy difference\n$$\n\\Delta U \\equiv U_{\\text{A}} - U_{\\text{B}}\n$$\nbetween Mode A and Mode B, expressed entirely in terms of $q$, $Q$, $\\alpha$, $z$, $d$, and $\\varepsilon_0$.\n\nYour final answer must be a single simplified analytic expression.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard principles of classical electrostatics and provides a clear, self-contained set of definitions and constraints. The model, while simplified, is a common approach in theoretical chemical physics for isolating specific interaction components. The problem is solvable as stated.\n\nThe task is to derive the interaction energy difference $\\Delta U \\equiv U_{\\text{A}} - U_{\\text{B}}$ between two modes of molecular recognition. We will calculate the energy for each mode, $U_{\\text{A}}$ and $U_{\\text{B}}$, separately and then find their difference.\n\nThe fundamental principles are Coulomb's law and the definitions of electrostatic potential, electric field, electric multipole moments, and polarization. The environment is vacuum, with permittivity $\\varepsilon_0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the expressions for the potential and field of the charge and quadrupole sources, consistent with standard multipole expansion conventions used in chemical physics.\nA point charge $q$ located at a displacement $z$ along the z-axis from the origin creates an electric field at the origin given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_q = -\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 z^2}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\nThe magnitude of this field is $E_q = \\frac{|q|}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 z^2}$.\n\nAn axial, neutral, permanent electric quadrupole with axial component $Q$ centered at the origin creates an electrostatic potential $\\phi_Q$ and electric field $\\mathbf{E}_Q$ along its symmetry axis (the z-axis). For a point at distance $z$ from the center, these are given by:\n$$ \\phi_Q(z) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 z^3} $$\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_Q(z) = -\\frac{\\partial \\phi_Q}{\\partial z}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\frac{3Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 z^4}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} $$\n\nThe energy of an induced dipole $\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{ind}}$ in an external field $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{ext}}$ is given by the work of formation, $U_{\\text{ind}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{ind}} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{ext}}$.

The problem states that the direct interaction between the permanent quadrupoles is to be neglected. The interaction energy arises solely from induction, where each ring's permanent quadrupolar field polarizes the other.\n\nThe total induction energy is the sum of the energy of Ring 1 being polarized in the field of Ring 2, and the energy of Ring 2 being polarized in the field of Ring 1.\nLet Ring 1 be at $z=0$ and Ring 2 be at $z=d$. The magnitude of the electric field produced by one ring's quadrupole at the center of the other is given by $E_Q(d)$:\n$$ E_Q = \\left|\\mathbf{E}_Q(d)\\right| = \\frac{3|Q|}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 d^4} $$\nThe induction energy of Ring 2 in the field of Ring 1 is $U_{\\text{ind}}(2 \\leftarrow 1) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E_Q^2$.\nThe induction energy of Ring 1 in the field of Ring 2 is $U_{\\text{ind}}(1 \\leftarrow 2) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E_Q^2$.\n\nThe total interaction energy for Mode B is:\n$$ U_{\\text{B}} = U_{\\text{ind}}(1 \\leftarrow 2) + U_{\\text{ind}}(2 \\leftarrow 1) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E_Q^2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha E_Q^2 = -\\alpha E_Q^2 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_Q$:\n$$ U_{\\text{B}} = -\\alpha \\left(\\frac{3Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 d^4}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{9\\alpha Q^2}{(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0)^2 d^8} = -\\frac{9\\alpha Q^2}{16\\pi^2\\varepsilon_0^2 d^8} $$\n\n**Interaction Energy Difference ($\\Delta U$)**\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta U = U_{\\text{A}} - U_{\\text{B}}$:\n$$ \\Delta U = \\left( \\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 z^3} - \\frac{\\alpha q^2}{32\\pi^2\\varepsilon_0^2 z^4} \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{9\\alpha Q^2}{16\\pi^2\\varepsilon_0^2 d^8} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta U = \\frac{qQ}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0 z^3} - \\frac{\\alpha q^2}{32\\pi^2\\varepsilon_0^2 z^4} + \\frac{9\\alpha Q^2}{16\\pi^2\\varepsilon_0^2 d^8} $$\nThis is the final, simplified analytical expression for the interaction energy difference in terms of the given parameters.",

We must relate this macroscopic constant to the intrinsic dissociation constant $K_D$. The relationship is determined by statistical factors arising from the valencies of the ligand and receptor.\n\n-   The intrinsic constant $K_D$ is a ratio of intrinsic dissociation ($k_{d,int}$) and association ($k_{a,int}$) rate constants: $K_D = \\frac{k_{d,int}}{k_{a,int}}$.\n-   For the macroscopic association reaction, a bivalent ligand ($2$ heads) interacts with a bivalent receptor ($2$ sites). The rate of formation of the first bond is enhanced because any of the $2$ heads can bind to any of the $2$ sites. The macroscopic association rate constant is $k_{a1} = 2 \\times 2 \\times k_{a,int} = 4k_{a,int}$.\n-   For the macroscopic dissociation reaction, the $\\mathrm{LR_{mono}}$ complex has only one bond to break. Therefore, the macroscopic dissociation rate constant is simply the intrinsic one: $k_{d1} = k_{d,int}$.\n-   Combining these, the macroscopic dissociation constant for the first step is:\n$$ K_{D1} = \\frac{k_{d1}}{k_{a1}} = \\frac{k_{d,int}}{4k_{a,int}} = \\frac{K_D}{4} $$\n\n**Step 2: Intramolecular Binding**\nThis step is an intramolecular cyclization.

We can relate it to the intrinsic constants and the effective molarity, $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\n-   The forward reaction (cyclization) involves the free head of the ligand binding to the free site on the receptor to which it is tethered. The rate of this intramolecular process is governed by the intrinsic association rate constant $k_{a,int}$ and the effective molarity $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which represents the concentration of the second binding site as \"seen\" by the tethered ligand head. The first-order rate constant for cyclization is $k_f = k_{a,int} c_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n-   The reverse reaction (ring-opening) involves the dissociation of the bivalently bound complex $\\mathrm{LR_{bi}}$. This complex has two identical bonds. Breaking either of these two indistinguishable bonds leads to the monovalent state $\\mathrm{LR_{mono}}$. Thus, the overall first-order rate constant for ring-opening is the sum of the rates for breaking each bond: $k_r = k_{d,int} + k_{d,int} = 2k_{d,int}$.\n-   The equilibrium constant for the second step is the ratio of the forward and reverse rate constants:\n$$ K_2 = \\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{k_{a,int} c_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2k_{d,int}} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2 \\left(\\frac{k_{d,int}}{k_{a,int}}\\right)} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{2K_D} $$\n\n**Overall Macroscopic Dissociation Constant**\nNow we combine the two steps to find $K_{D,\\mathrm{bi}}$.
