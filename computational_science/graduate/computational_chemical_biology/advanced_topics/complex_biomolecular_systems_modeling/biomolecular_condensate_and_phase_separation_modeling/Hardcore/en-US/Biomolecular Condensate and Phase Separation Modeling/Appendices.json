            "problem": "Consider a coarse-grained description of a multivalent protein (treated as a polymer of polymerization degree $N$) undergoing liquid–liquid phase separation with a bath of solvent. In the mean-field Flory–Huggins theory (Flory–Huggins (FH) theory), the Helmholtz free-energy density of mixing per Boltzmann constant times temperature, $f/(k_B T)$, for a polymer volume fraction $c \\in (0,1)$ can be modeled as the sum of an ideal mixing entropy contribution and an enthalpic interaction contribution characterized by the dimensionless Flory–Huggins parameter $\\chi$. From a stability analysis, the spinodal compositions are defined as those $c$ at which the curvature of the free-energy density with respect to $c$ vanishes, i.e., $f''(c)=0$, marking the boundary between metastable and unstable regimes.\n\nStarting from the standard FH free-energy density per $k_B T$ for a polymer solution, derive the spinodal condition $f''(c)=0$ and solve for the two spinodal compositions $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$ as functions of $N$ and $\\chi$. Then, for $N=10$ and $\\chi=1.5$, compute the explicit values of $c_{-}$ and $c_{+}$. Express the final answers as exact analytic expressions (no rounding).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the spinodal compositions within the framework of the Flory-Huggins (FH) theory for a polymer solution. The spinodal compositions mark the boundary of thermodynamic instability and are defined by the condition where the second derivative of the free-energy density with respect to the composition is zero.\n\nThe standard FH expression for the Helmholtz free energy of mixing per lattice site, divided by the thermal energy $k_B T$, is a function of the polymer volume fraction $c$. This quantity is dimensionless and will be denoted by $\\tilde{f}(c)$. It is given by the sum of the mixing entropy (ideal term) and the interaction enthalpy (regular solution term):\n$$ \\tilde{f}(c) = \\frac{c}{N} \\ln(c) + (1-c) \\ln(1-c) + \\chi c(1-c) $$\nHere, $N$ is the degree of polymerization of the polymer chains, and $\\chi$ is the dimensionless Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, which quantifies the effective interaction energy between polymer segments and solvent molecules. The volume fraction of the solvent is $1-c$.\n\nThe spinodal curve is determined by the condition $f''(c)=0$. Since $\\tilde{f}(c)$ is directly proportional to the free-energy density $f(c)$, this condition is equivalent to $\\frac{d^2\\tilde{f}}{dc^2} = 0$. We proceed by calculating the first and second derivatives of $\\tilde{f}(c)$ with respect to $c$.\n\nThe first derivative, $\\tilde{f}'(c)$, is:\n$$ \\tilde{f}'(c) = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ \\frac{c}{N} \\ln(c) + (1-c) \\ln(1-c) + \\chi(c-c^2) \\right] $$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$ \\tilde{f}'(c) = \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\ln(c) + \\frac{c}{N} \\cdot \\frac{1}{c} \\right) + \\left( -1 \\cdot \\ln(1-c) + (1-c) \\cdot \\frac{-1}{1-c} \\right) + \\chi(1-2c) $$\n$$ \\tilde{f}'(c) = \\frac{1}{N} \\ln(c) + \\frac{1}{N} - \\ln(1-c) - 1 + \\chi(1-2c) $$\n\nThe second derivative, $\\tilde{f}''(c)$, is found by differentiating $\\tilde{f}'(c)$:\n$$ \\tilde{f}''(c) = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left[ \\frac{1}{N} \\ln(c) + \\frac{1}{N} - \\ln(1-c) - 1 + \\chi(1-2c) \\right] $$\n$$ \\tilde{f}''(c) = \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{1}{c} - \\left( \\frac{-1}{1-c} \\right) - 2\\chi $$\n$$ \\tilde{f}''(c) = \\frac{1}{Nc} + \\frac{1}{1-c} - 2\\chi $$\n\nThe spinodal condition is $\\tilde{f}''(c) = 0$. Therefore, the equation for the spinodal compositions is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{Nc} + \\frac{1}{1-c} - 2\\chi = 0 $$\nTo solve for $c$, we first combine the fractions on the left-hand side:\n$$ \\frac{(1-c) + Nc}{Nc(1-c)} = 2\\chi $$\n$$ 1 - c + Nc = 2\\chi Nc(1-c) $$\n$$ 1 + (N-1)c = 2\\chi Nc - 2\\chi Nc^2 $$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form $ac^2+bc+d=0$:\n$$ (2\\chi N)c^2 + (N-1 - 2\\chi N)c + 1 = 0 $$\nThe two spinodal compositions, $c_-$ and $c_+$, are the roots of this quadratic equation.

The charge of a deprotonated acid site is $-1$ and a protonated base site is $+1$. The average charge from the acid sites per $100$ residues is $Q_{\\mathrm{A}} = N_{\\mathrm{A}} \\times (-1) \\times \\alpha_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}} = -40\\alpha_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}$. The average charge from the base sites per $100$ residues is $Q_{\\mathrm{B}} = N_{\\mathrm{B}} \\times (+1) \\times \\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH}^{+}} = 10\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH}^{+}}$.\nThe total net charge per $100$ residues is $Q_{100} = Q_{\\mathrm{A}} + Q_{\\mathrm{B}} = 10\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH}^{+}} - 40\\alpha_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}$.\n\nThe net average charge per residue, $q$, is this total charge divided by $100$:\n$$\nq = \\frac{10\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH}^{+}} - 40\\alpha_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}}{100} = 0.1\\alpha_{\\mathrm{BH}^{+}} - 0.4\\alpha_{\\mathrm{A}^{-}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated numerical values for the ionization fractions:\n$$\nq = 0.1(0.99981) - 0.4(0.99736)\n$$\n$$\nq = 0.099981 - 0.398944 = -0.298963\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $-0.2990$.",
