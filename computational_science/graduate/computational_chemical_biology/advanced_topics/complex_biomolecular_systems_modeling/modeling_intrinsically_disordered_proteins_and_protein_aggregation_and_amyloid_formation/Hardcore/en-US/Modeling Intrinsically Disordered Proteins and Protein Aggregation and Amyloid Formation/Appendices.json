To predict an IDP's propensity to self-assemble, we can analyze its composition using simple, yet powerful, metrics. This practice  introduces two such metrics: the average hydropathy, which quantifies the overall hydrophobic character, and the aromatic density, which measures the fraction of \"sticker\" residues that drive phase separation through specific intermolecular interactions.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem that is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles in computational chemical biology, specifically the analysis of intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) sequences. The problem supplies a specific amino acid sequence, definitions for the quantities to be calculated ($\\overline{H}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{aro}}$), and all necessary data (Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy values). The request for a mechanistic explanation is also a standard exercise in biophysical chemistry. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: first, a calculation of the sequence-averaged hydropathy, $\\overline{H}$, and the aromatic density, $f_{\\mathrm{aro}}$, for a given IDP sequence; and second, a mechanistic explanation of the role of aromatic residues in driving phase separation.\n\nFirst, we perform the required calculations. The length of the sequence is given as $N=30$. The sequence is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{G G Y G S R G G Y G G F G G R G G W G G Y R G G K G G S G G}\n$$\nTo compute the required quantities, we must first enumerate the occurrences of each amino acid residue in the sequence. Let $N_{\\alpha}$ denote the number of residues of type $\\alpha$. By direct counting, we find:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $N_{\\mathrm{G}}$ (Glycine) $= 19$\n    \\item $N_{\\mathrm{Y}}$ (Tyrosine) $= 3$\n    \\item $N_{\\mathrm{S}}$ (Serine) $= 2$\n    \\item $N_{\\mathrm{R}}$ (Arginine) $= 3$\n    \\item $N_{\\mathrm{F}}$ (Phenylalanine) $= 1$\n    \\item $N_{\\mathrm{W}}$ (Tryptophan) $= 1$\n    \\item $N_{\\mathrm{K}}$ (Lysine) $= 1$\n\\end{itemize}\nThe sum of these counts is $19+3+2+3+1+1+1=30$, which correctly matches the total sequence length $N$.\n\nThe aromatic density, $f_{\\mathrm{aro}}$, is defined as the fraction of aromatic residues, which in this context are Tyrosine ($Y$), Phenylalanine ($F$), and Tryptophan ($W$). Using the definition provided:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{aro}} \\equiv \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Y}}+N_{\\mathrm{F}}+N_{\\mathrm{W}}}{N}\n$$\nSubstituting the counted values:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{aro}} = \\frac{3+1+1}{30} = \\frac{5}{30} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is $f_{\\mathrm{aro}} \\approx 0.16666...$. Rounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $f_{\\mathrm{aro}} \\approx 0.1667$.\n\nNext, we compute the sequence-averaged hydropathy, $\\overline{H}$. The definition is:\n$$\n\\overline{H} \\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} h(s_i)\n$$\nwhere $h(s_i)$ is the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index of the residue $s_i$ at position $i$. This can be more conveniently calculated using the counts of each residue type:\n$$\n\\overline{H} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{\\alpha} N_{\\alpha} h(\\alpha)\n$$\nThe hydropathy values $h(\\alpha)$ are given for all residues present in the sequence: $h(\\mathrm{G})=-0.4$, $h(\\mathrm{Y})=-1.3$, $h(\\mathrm{S})=-0.8$, $h(\\mathrm{R})=-4.5$, $h(\\mathrm{F})=2.8$, $h(\\mathrm{W})=-0.9$, and $h(\\mathrm{K})=-3.9$.\nThe total sum of hydropathies is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} h(s_i) = N_{\\mathrm{G}}h(\\mathrm{G}) + N_{\\mathrm{Y}}h(\\mathrm{Y}) + N_{\\mathrm{S}}h(\\mathrm{S}) + N_{\\mathrm{R}}h(\\mathrm{R}) + N_{\\mathrm{F}}h(\\mathrm{F}) + N_{\\mathrm{W}}h(\\mathrm{W}) + N_{\\mathrm{K}}h(\\mathrm{K})\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} h(s_i) = (19)(-0.4) + (3)(-1.3) + (2)(-0.8) + (3)(-4.5) + (1)(2.8) + (1)(-0.9) + (1)(-3.9)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} h(s_i) = -7.6 - 3.9 - 1.6 - 13.5 + 2.8 - 0.9 - 3.9\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} h(s_i) = -28.6\n$$\nNow, we compute the average:\n$$\n\\overline{H} = \\frac{-28.6}{30} \\approx -0.95333...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\overline{H} \\approx -0.9533$.\n\nThe calculated quantities are $\\overline{H} \\approx -0.9533$ and $f_{\\mathrm{aro}} \\approx 0.1667$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a mechanistic explanation of how increasing the fraction of aromatic residues drives sticker-mediated interactions relevant to phase separation and aggregation.\n\nThe behavior of many IDPs, particularly those that undergo Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS), is often conceptualized using a \"sticker-and-spacer\" model. In this framework, \"stickers\" are specific residues that engage in strong, transient, multivalent intermolecular interactions, providing the cohesive energy that drives the formation of a dense, protein-rich phase. \"Spacers\" are typically more inert, flexible residues (like Glycine, which is abundant in the given sequence) that provide solubility and conformational entropy to the chain, ensuring the phase-separated state remains liquid-like and reversible.\n\nAromatic residues—specifically Tyrosine ($Y$), Phenylalanine ($F$), and Tryptophan ($W$)—are archetypal stickers. Increasing their fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{aro}}$, enhances the \"stickiness\" of the polymer chain. This enhanced attraction arises from several fundamental intermolecular interactions:\n\n1.  **$\\pi$-$\\pi$ Interactions:** The aromatic side chains possess delocalized $\\pi$-electron systems. These electron clouds can interact favorably with each other through so-called $\\pi$-$\\pi$ stacking. These are primarily a manifestation of London dispersion forces, but with a significant contribution from electrostatic interactions between the electron-rich faces and electron-poor edges of the aromatic rings. This allows for stable arrangements in both parallel-displaced (face-to-face) and T-shaped (edge-to-face) geometries. These interactions provide a specific, directional cohesive force between protein chains.\n\n2.  **Cation-$\\pi$ Interactions:** The electron-rich face of an aromatic ring can form a strong, non-covalent bond with a cation. In proteins, the positively charged side chains of Arginine ($R$) and Lysine ($K$) are potent cations. The interaction between the guanidinium group of $R$ or the ammonium group of $K$ and the $\\pi$ face of $Y$, $F$, or $W$ is a major stabilizing force in protein structure and a key driver of intermolecular association. The sequence provided contains both aromatic ($Y$, $F$, $W$) and cationic ($R$, $K$) residues, making cation-$\\pi$ interactions a primary mechanism for driving LLPS.\n\n3.  **Hydrophobic Effect:** This is a more general, mean-field effect. The large, predominantly nonpolar surface areas of aromatic side chains are entropically unfavorable to expose to water, which must form ordered clathrate-like cages around them. The aggregation of these hydrophobic groups minimizes the total solvent-exposed surface area, releasing the ordered water molecules into the bulk solvent. This results in a large increase in solvent entropy, providing a powerful thermodynamic driving force for protein self-association and phase separation.\n\n4.  **Hydrogen Bonding:** The hydroxyl group of Tyrosine and the indole nitrogen of Tryptophan can participate in hydrogen bonding, acting as donors and/or acceptors. While typically weaker than the aforementioned interactions, they contribute to the network of non-covalent bonds that stabilize the dense phase.\n\nFrom a mean-field perspective, phase separation is governed by the balance of enthalpy and entropy. The interactions described above (especially $\\pi$-$\\pi$ and cation-$\\pi$) contribute a significant negative enthalpy change ($\\Delta H$) when proteins associate. Increasing the sticker fraction $f_{\\mathrm{aro}}$ increases the number of potential favorable pairwise interactions per chain. In the context of a Flory-Huggins type model of polymer solutions, this corresponds to an increase in the magnitude of the effective interaction parameter, $\\chi$, which quantifies the net preference for protein-protein contacts over protein-solvent contacts. A larger $\\chi$ value promotes demixing, leading to phase separation at lower protein concentrations or higher temperatures.\n\nTherefore, increasing the number of aromatic stickers (increasing $f_{\\mathrm{aro}}$) directly enhances the multivalent, attractive intermolecular forces, providing the enthalpic gain necessary to overcome the entropic cost of creating a phase-separated system. These same strong sticker interactions, if they lead to structures that are too stable or kinetically trapped, can also serve as a gateway to irreversible aggregation and the formation of ordered pathological assemblies like amyloid fibrils.",

Angles must be interpreted in radians.\n  1. Case 1 (happy path): Sheet A sequence $\\mathrm{\"NSVDNSVD\"}$, Sheet B sequence $\\mathrm{\"DNSVNSVD\"}$, with $d = 0.50$ nm, $s = 0.00$ nm, $\\phi = 0.00$.\n  2. Case 2 (large separation boundary): same sequences as Case 1, with $d = 0.80$ nm, $s = 0.00$ nm, $\\phi = 0.00$.\n  3. Case 3 (misregistry): same sequences as Case 1, with $d = 0.50$ nm, $s = 0.235$ nm (half $p$), $\\phi = 0.00$.\n  4.

For example, a valid output format is\n  $$\\mathrm{[[E^{(1)}_{\\mathrm{vdW}},E^{(1)}_{\\mathrm{HB}},E^{(1)}_{\\mathrm{total}}],[E^{(2)}_{\\mathrm{vdW}},E^{(2)}_{\\mathrm{HB}},E^{(2)}_{\\mathrm{total}}],\\ldots]}$$\n  with no spaces in the printed string and with all numeric entries rounded to six decimal places.",
            "solution": "The user-provided problem statement is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard coarse-grained molecular modeling principles, well-posed with all necessary parameters and equations, and objective in its formulation. The task is to compute the interface energy of a steric zipper model based on Lennard-Jones and directional hydrogen bond potentials.\n\nThe solution will be implemented as a Python program that systematically follows the computational steps outlined in the problem.\n\n1.  **Model and Parameter Definition**: First, all physical parameters are defined as constants. These include residue-specific parameters $(\\sigma, \\varepsilon, \\text{donor/acceptor status})$ stored in a dictionary for easy look-up, and global constants such as the residue spacing $p$, interaction cutoff $r_c$, and hydrogen bond potential parameters ($E_{\\mathrm{hb0}}$, $r_0$, and the Gaussian width, which is explicitly named `S_HB_WIDTH` to avoid confusion with the registry shift $s$).\n\n2.  **Geometric Construction**: For each test case defined by packing parameters $(d, s, \\phi)$, the three-dimensional coordinates of the sidechain pseudoatoms are generated. The problem specifies that only residues at even indices on Sheet A and odd indices on Sheet B are at the interface.\n    -   Sheet A residues $(i=0, 2, 4, 6)$ are placed at positions $\\mathbf{r}_i^A = (i \\cdot p, 0, 0)$.\n    -   Sheet B residues $(j=1, 3, 5, 7)$ are placed at positions $\\mathbf{r}_j^B = (j \\cdot p + s, d, 0)$.\n    The orientation vectors for hydrogen bonding sites are also defined. For Sheet A, this is a fixed vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}^A = (0, 1, 0)$. For Sheet B, the base vector $(0, -1, 0)$ is rotated around the $z$-axis by the angle $\\phi$, yielding $\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}^B(\\phi) = (\\sin\\phi, -\\cos\\phi, 0)$.\n\n3.  **Potential Energy Calculation**: The program iterates through all unique pairs of interface-facing residues, with one residue from Sheet A ($i$) and one from Sheet B ($j$). For each pair $(i, j)$:\n    -   The inter-pseudoatom distance $r_{ij} = \\|\\mathbf{r}_j^B - \\mathbf{r}_i^A\\|$ is calculated. If $r_{ij}$ exceeds the cutoff distance $r_c$, the pair does not contribute to the energy.\n    -   **Van der Waals Energy ($E_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$)**: The Lennard-Jones potential $V_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r_{ij})$ is computed. The required mixed parameters $\\sigma_{ij}$ and $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ are determined using the Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules: $\\sigma_{ij} = (\\sigma_i + \\sigma_j)/2$ and $\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_i \\varepsilon_j}$. This energy is added to a running total for $E_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$.\n    -   **Hydrogen Bond Energy ($E_{\\mathrm{HB}}$)**: The hydrogen bond contribution is calculated only for donor-acceptor compatible pairs. The potential $V_{\\mathrm{HB}}$ is a function of distance $r_{ij}$ and two orientation angles, $\\theta_D$ and $\\theta_A$. These angles are computed via dot products involving the residue-to-residue vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ and the site orientation vectors $(\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_D, \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_A)$.\n        -   $\\cos\\theta_D = \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_D \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$\n        -   $\\cos\\theta_A = \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}_A \\cdot (-\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij})$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}_{ij}$ points from the donor to the acceptor.\n        The full calculation checks two possibilities for each pair: residue $i$ as donor and $j$ as acceptor, and vice-versa. As per the problem specification, if a pair allows for both (e.g., Asparagine-Asparagine), both potential energies are calculated, and the more stabilizing (minimum) value is taken as the pair's contribution. This value is added to a running total for $E_{\\mathrm{HB}}$.\n\n4.  **Aggregation and Output**: After summing the contributions over all pairs, the total energies $E_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{HB}}$, and $E_{\\mathrm{total}} = E_{\\mathrm{vdW}} + E_{\\mathrm{HB}}$ are computed. Each value is rounded to six decimal places. This process is repeated for all test cases provided. Finally, the results are formatted into a single string representing a list of lists, with no whitespace, as specified in the problem statement.",
