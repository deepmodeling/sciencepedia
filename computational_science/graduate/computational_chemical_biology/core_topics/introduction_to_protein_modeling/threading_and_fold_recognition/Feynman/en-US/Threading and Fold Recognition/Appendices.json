This exercise provides a foundational look at constructing such a score by combining two key biophysical ideas: residue-residue substitution preferences and environmental fitness.

            "problem": "In computational chemical biology, threading and fold recognition evaluate the compatibility of a query amino acid sequence with a structural template by combining residue-residue compatibility and environment-dependent penalties. At an advanced level, such scores can be grounded in statistical potentials derived from observed aligned residues and in environmental terms reflecting biophysical preferences for burial and exposure. Consider a toy alignment of length $5$, where the query sequence aligns position-wise to a template with known burial fractions. Residue identities for the aligned pairs are: position $1$: $\\text{A}$ with $\\text{A}$, position $2$: $\\text{R}$ with $\\text{D}$, position $3$: $\\text{V}$ with $\\text{I}$, position $4$: $\\text{N}$ with $\\text{V}$, position $5$: $\\text{L}$ with $\\text{L}$. The burial fractions (defined as $1$ minus the relative solvent accessibility) at the template positions are $\\phi_{1} = 0.1$, $\\phi_{2} = 0.9$, $\\phi_{3} = 0.7$, $\\phi_{4} = 0.8$, $\\phi_{5} = 0.95$. Assume background residue frequencies for the query are $p(\\text{A}) = 0.25$, $p(\\text{R}) = 0.15$, $p(\\text{V}) = 0.20$, $p(\\text{N}) = 0.10$, $p(\\text{L}) = 0.30$, and for the template are $q(\\text{A}) = 0.20$, $q(\\text{D}) = 0.15$, $q(\\text{I}) = 0.25$, $q(\\text{V}) = 0.20$, $q(\\text{L}) = 0.20$. From a curated set of homologous alignments, the observed joint probabilities for the specific aligned residue pairs in this toy example are $P(\\text{A},\\text{A}) = 0.08$, $P(\\text{R},\\text{D}) = 0.015$, $P(\\text{V},\\text{I}) = 0.06$, $P(\\text{N},\\text{V}) = 0.012$, $P(\\text{L},\\text{L}) = 0.075$. Use the natural logarithm $\\ln$ for any log-odds evaluation. For the burial penalty, use a linear penalty that increases with burial when a polar query residue aligns to a buried template position: let the polar set be $\\{\\text{D}, \\text{E}, \\text{K}, \\text{R}, \\text{H}, \\text{N}, \\text{Q}, \\text{S}, \\text{T}, \\text{Y}, \\text{C}\\}$, and apply a penalty $+\\gamma \\phi_{i}$ at position $i$ only if the query residue at position $i$ is polar, with $\\gamma = 0.5$. Define the threading score for this alignment by combining the residue-residue compatibility grounded in log-odds statistics with the environmental burial penalty as described. Compute the total threading score for the alignment and round your final result to four significant figures. Express your final answer without units.",
            "solution": "The total threading score, denoted by $S$, is defined as the sum of position-wise scores over the length of the alignment, which is $5$ residues. Each position-wise score is a combination of a residue-residue compatibility score and an environmental burial penalty. The total score $S$ can be expressed as:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} S_i$$\nwhere $S_i$ is the score for position $i$. The score $S_i$ is composed of a log-odds term for residue compatibility, $S_{\\text{log-odds}, i}$, and a burial penalty term, $P_i$. A penalty is a negative contribution to the score, so we define:\n$$S_i = S_{\\text{log-odds}, i} - P_i$$\n\nThe residue-residue compatibility score is grounded in log-odds statistics. For a query residue $x_i$ aligned with a template residue $y_i$ at position $i$, this score is:\n$$S_{\\text{log-odds}, i} = \\ln \\left( \\frac{P(x_i, y_i)}{p(x_i)q(y_i)} \\right)$$\nwhere $P(x_i, y_i)$ is the observed joint probability of the pair, and $p(x_i)$ and $q(y_i)$ are the background frequencies of the respective residues in the query and template protein populations.\n\nThe environmental penalty $P_i$ is applied only if the query residue $x_i$ is polar and is aligned to a buried position. The problem states the penalty is $+\\gamma \\phi_{i}$, where $\\gamma$ is a constant and $\\phi_i$ is the burial fraction at position $i$. The set of polar residues is given as $\\{\\text{D}, \\text{E}, \\text{K}, \\text{R}, \\text{H}, \\text{N}, \\text{Q}, \\text{S}, \\text{T}, \\text{Y}, \\text{C}\\}$.

The burial fraction is $\\phi_4 = 0.8$. The penalty is:\n$$P_4 = \\gamma \\phi_4 = 0.5 \\times 0.8 = 0.40$$\nThe log-odds score is:\n$$S_{\\text{log-odds}, 4} = \\ln \\left( \\frac{P(\\text{N},\\text{V})}{p(\\text{N})q(\\text{V})} \\right) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{0.012}{0.10 \\times 0.20} \\right) = \\ln \\left( \\frac{0.012}{0.02} \\right) = \\ln(0.6)$$\nSo, $S_4 = \\ln(0.6) - 0.40$.\n\n**Position 5:** Query residue $x_5=\\text{L}$ (Leucine), Template residue $y_5=\\text{L}$.\nLeucine is not in the polar set.

The alignment involves a total of $L = 50$ residues. The distances $d_i$ between the $\\alpha$-carbon atoms of the aligned residues are given in four groups:\n1.  $N_1 = 20$ residues with $d_i = 1$ Å.\n2.  $N_2 = 15$ residues with $d_i = 2$ Å.\n3.  $N_3 = 10$ residues with $d_i = 4$ Å.\n4.  $N_4 = 5$ residues with $d_i = 20$ Å.\n\nFirst, we compute the Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD).

The standard definition is:\n$$\n\\text{TM-score} = \\frac{1}{L_{\\text{nat}}} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{d_i}{d_0(L_{\\text{nat}})}\\right)^2}\n$$\nwhere $L$ is the number of aligned residue pairs, $L_{\\text{nat}}$ is the length of the native (template) protein, and $d_0$ is a length-dependent normalization factor given by:\n$$\nd_0(L_{\\text{nat}}) = 1.24 \\sqrt[3]{L_{\\text{nat}} - 15} - 1.8\n$$\nThe problem specifies an alignment over $L=50$ residues. It is standard practice in such cases to take the length of the protein being evaluated, $L_{\\text{nat}}$, as the length of the alignment, so we assume $L_{\\text{nat}} = L = 50$.\nFirst, we calculate $d_0$:\n$$\nd_0(50) = 1.24 \\sqrt[3]{50 - 15} - 1.8 = 1.24 \\sqrt[3]{35} - 1.8\n$$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt[3]{35} \\approx 3.271066$, we get:\n$$\nd_0 \\approx 1.24 \\cdot (3.271066) - 1.8 \\approx 4.056122 - 1.8 = 2.256122 \\text{ Å}\n$$\nThe summation term for the TM-score is calculated by summing the contributions from each group:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\frac{1}{1 + (d_i/d_0)^2} = N_1 \\frac{1}{1 + (1/d_0)^2} + N_2 \\frac{1}{1 + (2/d_0)^2} + N_3 \\frac{1}{1 + (4/d_0)^2} + N_4 \\frac{1}{1 + (20/d_0)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the group sizes and $d_0 \\approx 2.256122$:\n$$\n\\text{Sum} \\approx 20 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + (1/2.256122)^2}\\right) + 15 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + (2/2.256122)^2}\\right) + 10 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + (4/2.256122)^2}\\right) + 5 \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + (20/2.256122)^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Sum} \\approx 20 \\left(\\frac{1}{1.19646}\\right) + 15 \\left(\\frac{1}{1.78585}\\right) + 10 \\left(\\frac{1}{4.14341}\\right) + 5 \\left(\\frac{1}{79.5851}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Sum} \\approx 16.7156 + 8.3993 + 2.4135 + 0.0628\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Sum} \\approx 27.5912\n$$\nThe TM-score is then this sum divided by $L_{\\text{nat}} = 50$:\n$$\n\\text{TM-score} \\approx \\frac{27.5912}{50} \\approx 0.551824\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the TM-score is $0.5518$.\n\nFinally, we interpret which metric is more sensitive to the outliers. The outliers are the $5$ residues with a large distance of $d_i = 20$ Å.\nFor RMSD, the contribution to the sum of squares from the outliers is $5 \\cdot (20^2) = 2000$. The total sum of squares is $2240$. Thus, the outliers account for $2000/2240 \\approx 89.3\\%$ of the sum of squares. The $d_i^2$ term in the RMSD formula heavily penalizes large deviations, making the metric extremely sensitive to a few large-distance outliers. The resulting RMSD of $6.693$ Å is very high, suggesting an overall poor model quality.\nFor TM-score, the contribution to the sum from the outliers is approximately $0.0628$. The total sum is approximately $27.5912$. The outliers' contribution is only $0.0628 / 27.5912 \\approx 0.23\\%$. The term $1/(1+(d_i/d_0)^2)$ in the TM-score formula approaches $0$ as $d_i$ becomes very large. This means that beyond a certain distance, the penalty for a poor alignment does not increase significantly. This design makes the TM-score less sensitive to localized, large-deviation outliers and more reflective of the overall topological similarity. The resulting TM-score of $0.5518$ is above the typical threshold of $0.5$ for a correct fold, indicating that the model captures the global fold correctly despite the few severely misplaced residues.\n\nBased on this analysis, the RMSD is substantially more sensitive to the presence of the large-distance outliers than the TM-score.",
