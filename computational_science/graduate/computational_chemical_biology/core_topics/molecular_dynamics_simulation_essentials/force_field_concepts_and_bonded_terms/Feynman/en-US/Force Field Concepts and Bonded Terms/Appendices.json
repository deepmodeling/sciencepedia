            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the potential energy cost associated with small deviations from the equilibrium geometry of a linear triatomic molecule, $\\mathrm{A}\\text{-}\\mathrm{B}\\text{-}\\mathrm{C}$. The theoretical framework for this calculation is the harmonic approximation within a Molecular Mechanics (MM) force field, which is based on a Taylor series expansion of the potential energy function $U$ around the equilibrium geometry.\n\nThe potential energy $U$ of the system is a function of its internal coordinates: the bond lengths $r_{12}$ and $r_{23}$, and the bending angle $\\theta$. The potential energy can be expanded as a Taylor series around the equilibrium geometry, characterized by coordinates $q_{i,0}$ (where $q_1=r_{12}$, $q_2=r_{23}$, $q_3=\\theta$). The expansion is given by:\n$$ U(q_1, q_2, q_3) = U(q_{1,0}, q_{2,0}, q_{3,0}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial q_i} \\right)_0 \\Delta q_i + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial q_i \\partial q_j} \\right)_0 \\Delta q_i \\Delta q_j + \\dots $$\nIn this expression, $\\Delta q_i = q_i - q_{i,0}$ represents the displacement from the equilibrium value. A fundamental property of an equilibrium geometry is that the gradient of the potential energy is zero. Consequently, all first-derivative terms in the expansion vanish:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial q_i} \\right)_0 = 0 $$\nThe potential energy at equilibrium, $U(q_{1,0}, q_{2,0}, q_{3,0})$, serves as the reference energy, and for calculating the energy change, it can be set to zero. The problem statement also specifies that all cross-coupling second derivatives are zero, meaning $\\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial q_i \\partial q_j} \\right)_0 = 0$ for $i \\neq j$. This simplifies the energy expression to a sum of independent quadratic terms. The energy penalty for the displacement, $E_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is therefore the sum of the bond-stretching energy, $E_{\\mathrm{bond}}$, and the angle-bending energy, $E_{\\mathrm{angle}}$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{total}} = E_{\\mathrm{bond}} + E_{\\mathrm{angle}} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial r_{12}^2} \\right)_0 (\\Delta r_{12})^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial r_{23}^2} \\right)_0 (\\Delta r_{23})^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\right)_0 (\\Delta \\theta)^2 $$\nThe problem defines the effective force constants as these second derivatives:\n$$ k_{r,12} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial r_{12}^2} \\right)_0 = 1800 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,\\AA^{-2}} $$\n$$ k_{r,23} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial r_{23}^2} \\right)_0 = 1500 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,\\AA^{-2}} $$\n$$ k_{\\theta} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial \\theta^2} \\right)_0 = 250 \\, \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}\\,rad^{-2}} $$\nThe given deviations from the equilibrium geometry ($r_{0} = 1.20 \\, \\mathrm{\\AA}$, $\\theta_{0} = \\pi \\, \\mathrm{rad}$) are:\n$$ \\Delta r_{12} = +0.025 \\, \\mathrm{\\AA} $$\n$$ \\Delta r_{23} = -0.018 \\, \\mathrm{\\AA} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\theta = +3.5^{\\circ} $$\nA critical step before calculation is to ensure unit consistency.

The language is objective and precise. The values given are physically realistic for a biological system under physiological conditions. The task of deriving a force constant from a distribution is a standard technique known as Boltzmann inversion, particularly relevant in force field parameterization and coarse-graining. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is determined to be valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Expression\nThe probability density function, $P(\\theta)$, for a coordinate $\\theta$ in the canonical ensemble at temperature $T$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$P(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U(\\theta)}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $U(\\theta)$ is the potential energy associated with the angle $\\theta$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $Z$ is the partition function, which serves as a normalization constant.\n\nThe problem states that the potential $U(\\theta)$ can be approximated by a quadratic function near the equilibrium angle $\\theta_0$. This is the harmonic approximation:\n$$U(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\theta} (\\theta - \\theta_0)^2$$\nHere, $k_{\\theta}$ is the harmonic force constant. We can set the minimum potential energy $U(\\theta_0)$ to zero without loss of generality, as any constant energy offset is absorbed into the partition function $Z$.\n\nSubstituting the harmonic potential into the probability distribution gives:\n$$P(\\theta) \\approx \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k_{\\theta}(\\theta - \\theta_0)^2}{2 k_B T}\\right)$$\nThis functional form is that of a Gaussian (or Normal) distribution. The standard probability density function for a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ is:\n$$f(x; \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\nBy comparing the exponential term in $P(\\theta)$ with that of the standard Gaussian PDF, we can identify a direct correspondence. Matching the exponents for the variable $\\theta$ (which corresponds to $x$) with a mean of $\\theta_0$ (which corresponds to $\\mu$):\n$$\\frac{k_{\\theta}(\\theta - \\theta_0)^2}{2 k_B T} = \\frac{(\\theta - \\theta_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}$$\nFrom this equality, we can equate the denominators of the quadratic terms:\n$$\\frac{k_{\\theta}}{k_B T} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}$$\nThis gives a relationship between the variance $\\sigma^2$ and the force constant $k_{\\theta}$:\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\frac{k_B T}{k_{\\theta}}$$\nThe problem requires the final result to be expressed in per-mole energy units. The molar gas constant $R$ is related to the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ by Avogadro's number $N_A$, such that $R = N_A k_B$. By convention in molecular modeling, when energies are given per mole (e.g., $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$), the term $k_B T$ (energy per molecule) is replaced by $RT$ (energy per mole). Thus, the expression becomes:\n$$k_{\\theta} \\sigma^2 = RT$$\nRearranging for the force constant $k_{\\theta}$ yields the desired expression:\n$$k_{\\theta} = \\frac{RT}{\\sigma^2}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe now compute the numerical value of $k_{\\theta}$ using the provided data.\nGiven:\n- $R = 8.314462618 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $\\sigma^2 = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{rad}^2$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$k_{\\theta} = \\frac{(8.314462618 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K})}{0.050\\,\\mathrm{rad}^2}$$\nFirst, we calculate the product in the numerator:\n$$RT = (8.314462618 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 310 \\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\approx 2.5774834\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$$\nNow, we divide by the variance:\n$$k_{\\theta} = \\frac{2.5774834}{0.050} \\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{-2} \\approx 51.549668\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{-2}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$k_{\\theta} \\approx 51.55\\,\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{rad}^{-2}$$\n\n### Limitations of the Boltzmann Inversion Approach\nThe Boltzmann inversion method, while powerful, has several important limitations, especially in the context of parameterizing force fields for complex biomolecular systems.\n\n1.  **Harmonic Approximation**: The core assumption is that the potential energy surface is purely harmonic (quadratic). Real molecular potentials are anharmonic, especially for larger deviations from the equilibrium geometry. This method provides an *effective* harmonic force constant that best reproduces the fluctuation variance under the harmonic assumption, but it does not capture the true shape of the potential.\n\n2.  **Mean-Field Approximation and Coordinate Coupling**: This approach derives a potential for a single degree of freedom, $\\theta$, by averaging over all other degrees of freedom in the system. The resulting potential is technically a \"potential of mean force\" (PMF), not a pure, separable vacuum potential energy term. It implicitly includes effects from the solvent and couplings to other internal coordinates (e.g., correlated fluctuations in adjacent bond lengths and dihedral angles). Therefore, the derived $k_{\\theta}$ is context-dependent (i.e., it depends on the temperature, pressure, solvent, and the rest of the molecular structure) and not directly transferable to different environments or force fields that treat such couplings differently.\n\n3.  **Statistical Uncertainty and Sampling**: The accuracy of the derived parameter is contingent on the accuracy of the input probability distribution. This distribution is obtained from a finite-length MD simulation, which is subject to statistical noise and potential sampling errors. If the simulation is not long enough to adequately sample the conformational space of the angle $\\theta$, the calculated variance $\\sigma^2$ will be inaccurate, leading to an incorrect value for $k_{\\theta}$.",
