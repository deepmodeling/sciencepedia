The fraction of time it spends in the deprotonated neutral state, $\\mathrm{B}$, is $1 - \\alpha_{\\text{prot}} \\approx 0.7992$, or about $79.9\\%$.\nThe average charge, $\\langle q \\rangle$, of the residue at this pH is a weighted average of the charges of the two states:\n$$\n\\langle q \\rangle = \\alpha_{\\text{prot}} \\cdot (\\text{charge of } \\mathrm{BH}^{+}) + (1-\\alpha_{\\text{prot}}) \\cdot (\\text{charge of } \\mathrm{B})\n$$\n$$\n\\langle q \\rangle = (0.2008) \\cdot (+1) + (0.7992) \\cdot (0) = +0.2008\n$$\nIn a standard molecular dynamics simulation using a fixed-charge force field, one must assign an integer charge to the residue. This result indicates that the neutral, deprotonated state ($\\mathrm{B}$) is the dominant species. A common, though simplifying, choice would be to model the entire residue as neutral for the duration of the simulation. However, this neglects the electrostatic contribution of the less populated but charged state.\nThe choice of protonation state fundamentally alters the residue's electrostatic interactions.\n- In its protonated, charged form ($\\mathrm{BH}^{+}$), the residue has a formal charge of $+1$. It can participate in strong, long-range electrostatic interactions, such as forming salt bridges with negatively charged residues (e.g., aspartate or glutamate) or favorable ion-dipole interactions with polar groups and water. It also acts as a powerful hydrogen bond donor.\n- In its deprotonated, neutral form ($\\mathrm{B}$), the residue has no net charge. Its interactions are dominated by shorter-range forces, including dipole-dipole interactions and its capacity to act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor (e.g., via the lone pair on the imidazole nitrogen).\nThe role of solvation, particularly in an explicit-solvent simulation, is critical. The polar water molecules will orient themselves to screen the charges and stabilize both states, but the solvation shell will be structured very differently. The charged $\\mathrm{BH}^{+}$state will be strongly solvated by water molecules orienting their partial negative charges (on oxygen) toward the residue. This favorable solvation free energy is a key factor in determining the equilibrium. An explicit-solvent simulation correctly captures this differential solvation and the screening effect of the high-dielectric aqueous environment on electrostatic forces, which are essential for an accurate depiction of the active site's biophysics. For highly accurate studies, one might use advanced techniques like constant-pH MD to allow the residue to dynamically switch between protonation states according to the local electrostatic environment.",

This self-energy is the reversible work to charge the ion, as prescribed by the Born model. The work $dW$ to add a charge $dq'$ to a spherical conductor of radius $a$ and existing charge $q'$ in a medium of dielectric constant $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$ is $dW = V dq'$, where the potential is $V = \\frac{q'}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}a}$.

The positive sign indicates that the acid is much weaker in the low-dielectric protein interior, as creating a charge is energetically unfavorable.\n\nThe physical assumptions inherent in this continuum estimate are significant. The Born model simplifies a complex molecular system into a macroscopic-like electrostatic problem. Key assumptions include:\n1.  The protein interior and the bulk solvent are treated as homogeneous, isotropic dielectric continua, each described by a single dielectric constant ($\\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{water}}$, respectively). This ignores the atomic-level heterogeneity, granularity, and anisotropic nature of both the protein and water.\n2.  The ion is modeled as a perfect, rigid sphere of a fixed radius, $a$. The \"effective Born radius\" is a phenomenological parameter, not a true physical dimension, and it bundles complex effects into a single variable.\n3.  The boundary between the protein and water is assumed to be sharp and spherical, centered on the ion. In reality, the protein-water interface is irregular, and the location of the titratable group relative to this interface is critical.\n4.  The electrostatic contribution to the solvation of the neutral, protonated acid $\\mathrm{AH}$ is neglected. While the net charge is zero, the molecule has a dipole moment and higher multipole moments, which interact with the dielectric medium.\n5.  All specific molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and salt bridges between the ion and its surroundings (protein residues or structured water molecules), are ignored.\n\nThese assumptions lead to major sources of error when applying such a model to a real protein for simulation setup:\n1.  **Choice of Dielectric Constant ($\\epsilon$):** The value of the protein's internal dielectric constant is not a well-defined physical observable and is a subject of debate. The calculated $\\Delta \\mathrm{p}K_a$ is extremely sensitive to this parameter. A slight change in $\\epsilon$ from $2$ to $4$, for instance, has a large effect.\n2.  **Neglect of Specific Interactions:** In a real protein, the local environment dominates. A nearby positively-charged residue (e.g., arginine, lysine) or a hydrogen bond donor can strongly stabilize the anionic form $\\mathrm{A}^{-}$, overriding the unfavorable desolvation penalty predicted by the continuum model. Conversely, a nearby anion would destabilize it. These effects are absent from the model.\n3.  **Structural Relaxation:** The rigid-sphere model does not allow for any conformational rearrangement of the protein or local water molecules in response to the change in protonation state. Such relaxation would stabilize the charge and reduce the magnitude of the $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ shift.\n4.  **Definition of the Cavity and Radius:** The choice of the Born radius, $a$, is ambiguous and significantly impacts the result. Furthermore, the model does not account for the energy of creating the cavity to host the ion, which is a non-electrostatic term.\n\nIn summary, while the Born model provides a valuable first-order estimate of the large electrostatic penalty for burying a charge, its quantitative accuracy is limited. More sophisticated computational methods, such as solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation or using explicit-solvent free energy simulations, are required for more reliable $\\mathrm{p}K_a$ prediction in proteins.",

Substituting this into the PB equation gives:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{e}{\\epsilon} \\sum_{i} z_{i} n_{i}^{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_{i}e\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nThe linearized Poisson-Boltzmann (LPB) equation is obtained by assuming the potential energy is small compared to the thermal energy, i.e., $|z_{i}e\\phi(\\mathbf{r})| \\ll k_{B}T$. We can then use the Taylor expansion $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ for the exponential term:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx -\\frac{e}{\\epsilon} \\sum_{i} z_{i} n_{i}^{0} \\left(1 - \\frac{z_{i}e\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{B}T}\\right) $$\nExpanding the sum gives:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\approx -\\frac{e}{\\epsilon} \\left( \\sum_{i} z_{i} n_{i}^{0} - \\frac{e\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{B}T} \\sum_{i} z_{i}^{2} n_{i}^{0} \\right) $$\nThe first term in the parenthesis, $\\sum_{i} z_{i} n_{i}^{0}$, represents the net charge density in the bulk solution. Due to the principle of electroneutrality, the bulk solution has no net charge, so this term is zero. The equation simplifies to the LPB equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\left(\\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon k_{B}T} \\sum_{i} z_{i}^{2} n_{i}^{0}\\right) \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) $$\nThis is a homogeneous linear second-order partial differential equation of the form $\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\kappa^2 \\phi$, where the parameter $\\kappa$ is defined as:\n$$ \\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\epsilon k_{B}T} \\sum_{i} z_{i}^{2} n_{i}^{0} $$\nThe characteristic electrostatic screening length, or Debye length $\\lambda_{D}$, is defined as the reciprocal of $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\lambda_{D} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon k_{B}T}{e^2 \\sum_{i} z_{i}^{2} n_{i}^{0}}} $$\nNext, we relate the sum over number densities, $n_{i}^{0}$, to the molar ionic strength, $I$. The problem defines ionic strength in terms of molar concentrations $c_{i}$ (in $\\mathrm{mol/L}$ or $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$) as $I = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i}c_{i}z_{i}^{2}$. The number density $n_{i}^{0}$ (in $\\mathrm{ions/m^3}$) is related to the molar concentration $c_{i}$ (in $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$) by Avogadro's constant, $N_{A}$: $n_{i}^{0} = c_{i}N_{A}$.\nSubstituting this into the sum:\n$$ \\sum_{i} z_{i}^{2} n_{i}^{0} = \\sum_{i} z_{i}^{2} (c_{i}N_{A}) = N_{A} \\sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i}^{2} $$\nFrom the definition of ionic strength $I$, we have $\\sum_{i} c_{i} z_{i}^{2} = 2I$. Therefore:\n$$ \\sum_{i} z_{i}^{2} n_{i}^{0} = 2 N_{A} I $$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $\\lambda_{D}$ yields the closed-form analytic expression for the screening length in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ \\lambda_{D} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon k_{B}T}{e^2 (2 N_{A} I)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_{r}\\epsilon_{0} k_{B}T}{2 N_{A} e^2 I}} $$\nThis is the required derivation.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically. First, we must express all quantities in base SI units.\nThe salt concentration is $c_{s}=150\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$. For a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte (e.g., NaCl $\\rightarrow$ Na$^{+}$ + Cl$^{-}$), the concentrations of the cation and anion are both equal to the salt concentration, $c_{+} = c_{-} = c_{s}$. The valences are $z_{+}=+1$ and $z_{-}=-1$. The ionic strength in molarity is:\n$$ I_M = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum c_i z_i^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (c_s(+1)^2 + c_s(-1)^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(c_s + c_s) = c_s = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{M} $$\nWe must convert the ionic strength to SI units of $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$:\n$$ I = 0.150\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{L}}{1\\,\\mathrm{m^3}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3} $$\nThe given constants are:\n$\\epsilon_{r} = 78.37$\n$\\epsilon_{0} = 8.854187817\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n$k_{B} = 1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$\n$T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$N_{A} = 6.02214076\\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$\n$e = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe permittivity of the medium is $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 = 78.37 \\times 8.854187817\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m} \\approx 6.94044 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$.\n\nLet's calculate the numerator of the term under the square root:\n$$ \\epsilon k_{B} T = (6.94044 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) \\times (1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) $$\n$$ \\epsilon k_{B} T \\approx 2.8555 \\times 10^{-30}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot F/m} $$\nNow, the denominator:\n$$ 2 N_{A} e^2 I = 2 \\times (6.02214076\\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}) \\times (1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2 \\times (150\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3}) $$\n$$ 2 N_{A} e^2 I \\approx 4.6380 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C^2/m^3} $$\nThe units are consistent: $\\mathrm{J \\cdot F/m} = (\\mathrm{C \\cdot V}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{C/V}) / \\mathrm{m} = \\mathrm{C^2/m}$.\n\nNow we compute $\\lambda_{D}$:\n$$ \\lambda_{D} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.8555 \\times 10^{-30}\\,\\mathrm{C^2/m}}{4.6380 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C^2/m^3}}} = \\sqrt{6.1568 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} $$\n$$ \\lambda_{D} \\approx 7.8465 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem asks for the result in nanometers, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\lambda_{D} = 7.8465 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.78465\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.785\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\n\nThis screening length has a profound implication for biomolecular interactions. The electrostatic potential $\\phi(r)$ of a charge in an electrolyte solution decays according to a screened Coulomb potential, $\\phi(r) \\propto \\frac{1}{r}\\exp(-r/\\lambda_D)$, rather than the simple $1/r$ dependence in a vacuum. The Debye length $\\lambda_D$ is the characteristic distance over which the potential is attenuated by a factor of $1/e$. For the given physiological salt concentration, $\\lambda_D$ is approximately $0.785\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ (or $7.85\\,\\mathrm{Å}$). This means that electrostatic interactions between charged groups on two associating proteins are significant only over very short distances, typically less than a few nanometers. Beyond this range, the charges are effectively \"screened\" by the cloud of counter-ions from the salt solution, rendering long-range electrostatic attraction or repulsion negligible. This short-range nature of electrostatics in solution is a critical factor governing the specificity and kinetics of protein-protein association.",
