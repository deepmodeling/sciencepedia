The provided dispersion relation is the standard one for internal gravity waves in a rotating, stratified fluid under the Boussinesq approximation.

It is formalizable, self-contained, and scientifically feasible. The provided numerical values are realistic for oceanic conditions. The slight ambiguity of mentioning \"hydrostatic\" dynamics while providing a \"non-hydrostatic\" dispersion relation is resolved by the explicit instruction to use the provided relation as the fundamental basis, making the instruction set internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe starting point is the given dispersion relation for linear internal gravity waves in a uniformly stratified, rotating fluid:\n$$\n\\hat{\\omega}^{2} = \\frac{N^{2} k^{2} + f^{2} m^{2}}{k^{2} + m^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\omega}$ is the intrinsic frequency, $k$ is the horizontal wavenumber, $m$ is the vertical wavenumber, $N$ is the buoyancy frequency, and $f$ is the Coriolis parameter.\n\nFor steady waves forced by flow over topography, the frequency in the frame of reference of the moving fluid, $\\hat{\\omega}$, is the Doppler-shifted frequency. For a mean flow $U$ aligned with the wavenumber $k$, this is given by the steady forcing condition:\n$$\n\\hat{\\omega} = k U\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into the dispersion relation yields:\n$$\n(k U)^{2} = \\frac{N^{2} k^{2} + f^{2} m^{2}}{k^{2} + m^{2}}\n$$\nOur goal is to solve this equation for the vertical wavenumber $m$. We begin by rearranging the equation to isolate terms involving $m^2$:\n$$\n(k U)^{2} (k^{2} + m^{2}) = N^{2} k^{2} + f^{2} m^{2}\n$$\n$$\nk^{4} U^{2} + k^{2} U^{2} m^{2} = N^{2} k^{2} + f^{2} m^{2}\n$$\n$$\nk^{2} U^{2} m^{2} - f^{2} m^{2} = N^{2} k^{2} - k^{4} U^{2}\n$$\nFactoring out $m^{2}$ on the left side and $k^2$ on the right side gives:\n$$\nm^{2} (k^{2} U^{2} - f^{2}) = k^{2} (N^{2} - k^{2} U^{2})\n$$\nSolving for $m^{2}$, we obtain:\n$$\nm^{2} = k^{2} \\frac{N^{2} - k^{2} U^{2}}{k^{2} U^{2} - f^{2}}\n$$\nThis can also be written in terms of the steady intrinsic frequency $\\hat{\\omega} = kU$:\n$$\nm^{2} = k^{2} \\frac{N^{2} - \\hat{\\omega}^{2}}{\\hat{\\omega}^{2} - f^{2}}\n$$\nThe vertical wavenumber $m$ is the square root of this expression. We are interested in the resonant vertical wavenumber for the propagating branch, so we consider the positive root:\n$$\nm = |k| \\sqrt{\\frac{N^{2} - \\hat{\\omega}^{2}}{\\hat{\\omega}^{2} - f^{2}}}\n$$\nSince wavenumber $k$ is typically defined as a positive quantity ($k = 2\\pi/L > 0$), we can write $m = k \\sqrt{\\frac{N^{2} - (kU)^{2}}{(kU)^{2} - f^{2}}}$.\n\nNext, we identify the regimes for vertically propagating versus evanescent solutions.\n- **Vertically propagating waves** require a real vertical wavenumber, which means $m^{2} > 0$. Since $k^2$ is always positive, this condition is satisfied if the term $\\frac{N^{2} - \\hat{\\omega}^{2}}{\\hat{\\omega}^{2} - f^{2}}$ is positive. This occurs when the numerator and denominator have the same sign. In typical oceanic conditions, $N > f$.\n  1. Both positive: $N^{2} - \\hat{\\omega}^{2} > 0$ and $\\hat{\\omega}^{2} - f^{2} > 0$. This implies $\\hat{\\omega}^2  N^2$ and $\\hat{\\omega}^2 > f^2$. As frequencies are positive, this gives the condition $f  \\hat{\\omega}  N$.\n  2. Both negative: $N^{2} - \\hat{\\omega}^{2}  0$ and $\\hat{\\omega}^{2} - f^{2}  0$. This implies $\\hat{\\omega} > N$ and $\\hat{\\omega}  f$. Since $N > f$, these conditions are mutually exclusive.\n  Therefore, the vertically propagating regime corresponds to an intrinsic frequency $\\hat{\\omega} = kU$ that lies between the Coriolis frequency and the buoyancy frequency: $f  kU  N$.\n\n- **Evanescent waves** require an imaginary vertical wavenumber, meaning $m^{2}  0$. This occurs when the numerator and denominator have opposite signs.\n  1. $N^{2} - \\hat{\\omega}^{2} > 0$ and $\\hat{\\omega}^{2} - f^{2}  0$. This gives $\\hat{\\omega}  N$ and $\\hat{\\omega}  f$. Since $f  N$, this simplifies to $\\hat{\\omega}  f$. This is the sub-inertial (or rotational) evanescent regime.\n  2. $N^{2} - \\hat{\\omega}^{2}  0$ and $\\hat{\\omega}^{2} - f^{2} > 0$. This gives $\\hat{\\omega} > N$ and $\\hat{\\omega} > f$. Since $N > f$, this simplifies to $\\hat{\\omega} > N$. This is the supercritical (or buoyancy) evanescent regime.\n\nNow, we use the provided numerical values to determine the regime and compute $m$.\nThe given parameters are:\n- $N = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- $f = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- $U = 0.20\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the horizontal wavenumber $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{2\\pi}{L} = \\frac{2\\pi}{5.0 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{\\pi}{2500}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}} \\approx 1.2566 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the intrinsic frequency $\\hat{\\omega} = kU$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\omega} = kU = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2500}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}\\right) (0.20\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) = \\frac{0.2\\pi}{2500}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} = \\frac{\\pi}{12500}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\approx 2.5133 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nWe check if the parameters lie in the propagating regime by testing the condition $f  \\hat{\\omega}  N$:\n$$\n1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}  2.5133 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}  5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied, since $1.0  2.5133$ and $2.5133 \\times 10^{-4}  50 \\times 10^{-4}$. Thus, the chosen parameters indeed correspond to vertically propagating waves.\n\nWe proceed to compute the value of $m$ using the derived formula:\n$$\nm^2 = k^2 \\frac{N^2 - (kU)^2}{(kU)^2 - f^2}\n$$\nWe have the following squared values:\n- $k^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2500}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6.25 \\times 10^{6}}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}$\n- $N^2 = (5.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-2}}$\n- $(kU)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12500}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2}{1.5625 \\times 10^{8}}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-2}}$\n- $f^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})^2 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-2}}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $m^2$:\n$$\nm^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6.25 \\times 10^{6}}\\right) \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-5} - \\frac{\\pi^2}{1.5625 \\times 10^{8}}}{\\frac{\\pi^2}{1.5625 \\times 10^{8}} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}}\n$$\nApproximating $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696044$:\n$$\n(kU)^2 \\approx \\frac{9.8696044}{1.5625 \\times 10^{8}} \\approx 6.3165468 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-2}}\n$$\n$$\nk^2 \\approx \\frac{9.8696044}{6.25 \\times 10^{6}} \\approx 1.5791367 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}\n$$\n$$\nm^2 \\approx (1.5791367 \\times 10^{-6}) \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-5} - 6.3165468 \\times 10^{-8}}{6.3165468 \\times 10^{-8} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}}\n$$\n$$\nm^2 \\approx (1.5791367 \\times 10^{-6}) \\frac{2.4936835 \\times 10^{-5}}{5.3165468 \\times 10^{-8}}\n$$\n$$\nm^2 \\approx (1.5791367 \\times 10^{-6}) (469.0345)\n$$\n$$\nm^2 \\approx 7.40679 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}\n$$\nTaking the square root to find $m$:\n$$\nm = \\sqrt{7.40679 \\times 10^{-4}}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}} \\approx 0.0272154\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.02722$.\nThe resonant vertical wavenumber for the vertically propagating branch is $m \\approx 0.02722\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}}$.",

The concepts of internal waves, buoyancy frequency ($N$), Coriolis parameter ($f$), wavenumbers ($k_h$, $m$), and the distinction between hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic regimes are core principles of physical oceanography.

This is a clear, answerable conceptual question.\n- **Objective:** The terminology is technical and precise (e.g., \"hydrostatic balance,\" \"elliptic Pressure Poisson Equation,\" \"divergence-free constraint\"). The problem is free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nAll validation criteria are met. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe governing equations for an incompressible, rotating, stratified fluid under the Boussinesq approximation are:\n1.  **Horizontal Momentum:**\n    $$ \\frac{D \\mathbf{u}_h}{Dt} + f \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\mathbf{u}_h = - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla_h p $$\n    where $\\mathbf{u}_h = (u,v)$ is the horizontal velocity vector, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $\\rho_0$ is a constant reference density, and $p$ is the pressure.\n\n2.  **Vertical Momentum:**\n    $$ \\frac{Dw}{Dt} = - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} - g \\frac{\\rho'}{\\rho_0} $$\n    where $w$ is the vertical velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\\rho'$ is the density perturbation from the background state $\\bar{\\rho}(z)$. The term $\\frac{Dw}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla w$ represents the total (material) derivative of the vertical velocity, i.e., the vertical fluid acceleration.\n\n3.  **Incompressibility (Continuity):**\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n\n4.  **Buoyancy/Density Conservation:**\n    $$ \\frac{D b}{Dt} + w N^2 = 0 $$\n    where $b = -g\\rho'/\\rho_0$ is the buoyancy and $N^2 = -\\frac{g}{\\rho_0} \\frac{d\\bar{\\rho}}{dz}$ is the squared buoyancy frequency, assumed constant.\n\n**Hydrostatic Approximation:**\nIn this approximation, vertical accelerations are assumed to be negligible compared to the forces of pressure gradient and buoyancy. Thus, the $\\frac{Dw}{Dt}$ term in the vertical momentum equation is set to zero:\n$$ 0 \\approx - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} - g \\frac{\\rho'}{\\rho_0} \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = - \\rho g $$\nThis is the equation of hydrostatic balance. This approximation is valid for motions whose horizontal length scale is much larger than their vertical length scale. For a wave with horizontal wavenumber $k_h$ and vertical wavenumber $m$, this corresponds to a small aspect ratio, $k_h/m \\ll 1$. Low-mode internal tides, which have very long horizontal wavelengths (small $k_h$), generally satisfy this condition and are well-represented by hydrostatic models. However, lee waves generated by flow over steep, small-scale topography often have $k_h \\sim m$, meaning the hydrostatic approximation is invalid and would lead to an inaccurate representation of the wave dynamics. In a hydrostatic model, pressure is obtained by vertical integration of the density field, and the continuity equation is used to diagnose the vertical velocity from the divergence of the horizontal velocity field.\n\n**Nonhydrostatic Model:**\nA nonhydrostatic model retains the full vertical momentum equation, including the acceleration term $\\frac{Dw}{Dt}$. It is necessary for accurately simulating phenomena where vertical accelerations are significant, such as lee waves ($k_h \\sim m$) or breaking internal waves.\n\n**The Role of the Pressure Solver:**\nTo solve the full set of equations numerically, one must ensure that the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}$ remains divergence-free at each time step, satisfying $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. A common technique is the projection method. In this method, one can conceptually take the divergence of the full vector momentum equation. This leads to an elliptic partial differential equation for the pressure, known as the Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE):\n$$ \\nabla^2 p = \\text{function of velocity and buoyancy fields} $$\nMore specifically, a common numerical implementation involves advancing velocity in time with all terms except the pressure gradient to get an intermediate velocity $\\mathbf{u}^*$. The pressure $p^{n+1}$ at the new time step is then found by solving the PPE:\n$$ \\nabla^2 p^{n+1} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\Delta t} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^* $$\nSolving this elliptic equation for $p^{n+1}$ yields the pressure field required to project the velocity field onto the space of divergence-free fields, thus enforcing incompressibility. The pressure found in this way includes the nonhydrostatic component that is dynamically linked to vertical accelerations. This step is computationally expensive and is the primary reason nonhydrostatic models are more costly than hydrostatic models, where pressure is diagnosed simply by vertical integration.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Hydrostatic $z$-coordinate models impose $p_z = -\\rho g$ and neglect $w_t$, and therefore credibly resolve low-mode internal tides with $k_h/m \\ll 1$ but underresolve nonhydrostatic lee waves with $k_h \\sim m$. Nonhydrostatic models retain $w_t$ and require solving an elliptic Pressure Poisson Equation (PPE) each time step to enforce $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ and obtain the dynamic pressure associated with vertical accelerations.**\nThis statement is a comprehensive and accurate summary.\n- The description of the hydrostatic model, its key assumption ($p_z = -\\rho g$, which implies neglecting $\\frac{Dw}{Dt}$, which contains $w_t$), and its regime of applicability (low-mode internal tides, $k_h/m \\ll 1$) are all correct.\n- The description of its failure for nonhydrostatic lee waves ($k_h \\sim m$) is also correct.\n- The description of the nonhydrostatic model retaining the full dynamics (including $w_t$) is correct.\n- The statement that nonhydrostatic models require solving an elliptic PPE to enforce $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$ and find the dynamic pressure is the central point of distinguishes the numerical solution procedure from hydrostatic models. This is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Hydrostatic $z$-coordinate models and nonhydrostatic models both resolve lee waves equally well if the vertical grid spacing is sufficiently small; a pressure solver is only needed to compute the hydrostatic pressure and is optional for nonhydrostatic implementations.**\nThis statement is incorrect on several counts.\n- `...both resolve lee waves equally well...`: This is false. A hydrostatic model fundamentally lacks the physics of vertical acceleration, which is essential for many lee waves. Increasing grid resolution cannot compensate for missing physics in the governing equations.\n- `...a pressure solver is only needed to compute the hydrostatic pressure...`: This is false. Hydrostatic pressure is computed by direct integration, not by solving an elliptic PDE. The elliptic pressure solver is for the nonhydrostatic dynamic pressure.\n- `...and is optional for nonhydrostatic implementations`: This is false. For an incompressible model, enforcing the divergence-free constraint is mandatory, not optional. The PPE is the standard method for doing so.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Hydrostatic $z$-coordinate models are necessary to resolve nonhydrostatic internal tides because $z$ coordinates align with gravity; nonhydrostatic models cannot represent baroclinic tides unless transformed to terrain-following coordinates, and pressure can be diagnosed explicitly without solving an elliptic equation.**\nThis statement is riddled with errors.\n- `Hydrostatic $z$-coordinate models are necessary to resolve nonhydrostatic internal tides...`: This is a contradiction in terms. Hydrostatic models, by definition, cannot resolve nonhydrostatic phenomena.\n- `nonhydrostatic models cannot represent baroclinic tides unless transformed to terrain-following coordinates`: This is false. Nonhydrostatic models can be and are implemented in $z$-coordinate systems, often using techniques like partial cells or shaved cells to represent topography. The choice of coordinate system is distinct from the choice of physical approximations.\n- `pressure can be diagnosed explicitly without solving an elliptic equation`: This is true for hydrostatic models but false for nonhydrostatic models. The statement conflates the two.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Hydrostatic $z$-coordinate models cannot simulate any internal gravity waves because $p$ is constant in $z$; nonhydrostatic models avoid elliptic pressure problems by prognosing pressure using the equation of state, which makes them computationally cheaper than hydrostatic models.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed.\n- `Hydrostatic ... models cannot simulate any internal gravity waves because p is constant in z`: This is false. Pressure $p$ is not constant in $z$; its gradient is $\\partial p/\\partial z = -\\rho g$. Hydrostatic models are routinely used to simulate large-scale internal gravity waves.\n- `nonhydrostatic models avoid elliptic pressure problems by prognosing pressure using the equation of state`: This is false. Incompressible nonhydrostatic models do not avoid the elliptic pressure problem; they must solve it. The equation of state is a diagnostic relation, not a prognostic one for pressure dynamics in this context.\n- `...which makes them computationally cheaper...`: This is false. Nonhydrostatic models are significantly more expensive than hydrostatic models precisely because they must solve the computationally intensive elliptic PPE.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The hydrostatic approximation alters the internal wave dispersion relation only through the Coriolis term $f$, so nonhydrostatic effects are negligible for lee waves in the subinertial regime; the pressure solver is needed primarily to conserve potential vorticity, not to enforce $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$.**\nThis statement demonstrates a deep misunderstanding of the physics and numerics.\n- `...alters the ... dispersion relation only through the Coriolis term f`: This is false. The full dispersion relation is $\\omega^2 = (N^2 k_h^2 + f^2 m^2) / (k_h^2 + m^2)$. The hydrostatic approximation, valid for $k_h^2 \\ll m^2$, yields $\\omega^2 \\approx N^2 (k_h/m)^2 + f^2$. This approximation fundamentally changes the dependence on both $N^2$ and $f^2$ by altering the denominator. The dominant effect is on the stratification term.\n- `...nonhydrostatic effects are negligible for lee waves in the subinertial regime`: This is false. Whether a lee wave is nonhydrostatic depends on its aspect ratio ($k_h/m$), not its frequency regime relative to $f$. Lee waves are stationary in a steady flow, so they are always subinertial ($\\omega = 0$ in the frame of the topography), but can be strongly nonhydrostatic.\n- `the pressure solver is needed primarily to conserve potential vorticity...`: This is false. The direct and primary mathematical function of the PPE in the projection method is to enforce the incompressibility constraint $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. Conserving other quantities like PV is a desired outcome of an accurate overall numerical scheme, not the primary purpose of the pressure-solve step itself.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "You will quantify the impact of algorithmic diffusion introduced by an implicit Laplacian closure on the cross-beam structure of an internal tide beam, and assess its effect relative to physical viscosity. Consider a small-amplitude, linear internal wave beam in a uniformly stratified, inviscid background, modeled under the Boussinesq approximation. For internal gravity waves, the continuous dispersion relation between the frequency $\\omega$, the buoyancy frequency $N$, and the wavevector components $(k_x,k_z)$ is given by\n$$\n\\omega^2 = N^2 \\frac{k_x^2}{k_x^2 + k_z^2}.\n$$\nUnder a paraxial, slowly varying envelope approximation along the beam-aligned coordinate $s$ and the cross-beam coordinate $n$, and retaining linear viscous damping through a Laplacian closure, the envelope $u(n,s,t)$ satisfies the scalar advection-diffusion model\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + c_b \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial s} = D_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial n^2},\n$$\nwhere $c_b$ is the along-beam group speed and $D_{\\mathrm{phys}}$ is an effective physical diffusivity proportional to the kinematic viscosity projected onto the beam. You will isolate the cross-beam diffusion at fixed $s$ and focus on $u(n,t)$ governed by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial n^2},\n$$\nwhich captures the leading-order effect of viscosity on beam thickness and amplitude in time at a fixed along-beam station, while advection along $s$ only shifts the beam without altering the cross-beam structure.\n\nYou will treat diffusion numerically using an implicit Laplacian closure with backward Euler in time and a second-order centered finite difference in space on a periodic domain. Denote the spatial grid spacing by $\\Delta x$, the time step by $\\Delta t$, and the discrete Laplacian operator by $L_h$. The numerical update for one time step is\n$$\nu^{n+1} - \\Delta t\\, D_{\\mathrm{closure}} L_h u^{n+1} = u^n,\n$$\nwhere $D_{\\mathrm{closure}}$ is the closure coefficient used by the model. In a discrete Fourier representation on the periodic grid, the discrete Laplacian has symbol\n$$\n\\lambda_h(k) = \\frac{4 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)}{\\Delta x^2},\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the continuous wavenumber compatible with the periodic grid.

Solve the diffusion equation analytically to obtain the width $w(t)$ and the center amplitude $A(t) = u(0,t)$ as functions of time $t$ and $D_{\\mathrm{phys}}$. Report explicit formulas for $w(t)$ and $A(t)$.\n\nTask C (Numerical experiment and assessment): Implement a spectral method on a periodic domain of length $L = N \\Delta x$ with $N$ grid points to evolve the Gaussian profile for a total time $T = N_{\\mathrm{steps}} \\Delta t$ using the implicit Laplacian closure with $D_{\\mathrm{closure}} = D_{\\mathrm{phys}}$. Use the discrete Fourier transform to apply the per-step amplification factor $G_{\\mathrm{num}}(k)$ to each mode $k$ for $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$ steps, and reconstruct $u(n,T)$. Compute:\n- The numerical center amplitude $A_{\\mathrm{num}}(T)$.\n- The numerical width $w_{\\mathrm{num}}(T)$ defined by the second-moment estimator\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{num}}^2(T) = \\frac{2 \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} n^2 u(n,T)\\, \\mathrm{d}n}{\\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} u(n,T)\\, \\mathrm{d}n},\n$$\nimplemented with discrete sums on the grid.\n- The analytical predictions $A_{\\mathrm{anal}}(T)$ and $w_{\\mathrm{anal}}(T)$ from Task B.\n- The relative error metrics\n$$\n\\varepsilon_w = w_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - w_{\\mathrm{anal}}(T), \\quad \\varepsilon_A = A_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - A_{\\mathrm{anal}}(T),\n$$\nexpressed respectively in meters and dimensionless amplitude units. Additionally, quantify the ratio between the effective numerical diffusivity and the physical closure for the Gaussian’s root-mean-square wavenumber $k_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ defined by the Gaussian’s Fourier variance, which for $u(n,0)$ above is $k_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{2}/w_0$. Compute\n$$\nR_D = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k_{\\mathrm{rms}},\\Delta x)}{D_{\\mathrm{phys}}},\n$$\nto measure the numerical under- or over-diffusion introduced by the discrete Laplacian symbol at the dominant wavenumber scale of the beam.\n\nPhysical units and output requirements:\n- Express all lengths (including $w_0$, $w_{\\mathrm{num}}(T)$, $w_{\\mathrm{anal}}(T)$, and $\\varepsilon_w$) in meters.\n- Express all times (including $T$) in seconds.\n- Express all diffusivities (including $D_{\\mathrm{phys}}$) in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Center amplitude $A$ is dimensionless.\n- Angles are not required in this problem; if any trigonometric arguments occur, they must be in radians.\n- For each test case below, your program must output a list of three floats: $[\\varepsilon_w,\\varepsilon_A,R_D]$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of wave mechanics and numerical analysis, well-posed, and entirely objective. All definitions, parameters, and tasks are specified with sufficient clarity to permit a unique and verifiable solution.\n\n### Task A: Derivation of Effective Numerical Diffusivity\n\nThe goal is to find the effective numerical diffusivity $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k,\\Delta x)$ that links the numerical amplification factor $G_{\\mathrm{num}}(k)$ to a continuum-like form.\n\nThe numerical amplification factor for the implicit scheme is given by:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{num}}(k) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\Delta t\\, D_{\\mathrm{closure}}\\, \\lambda_h(k)}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_h(k)$ is the symbol of the discrete Laplacian:\n$$\n\\lambda_h(k) = \\frac{4 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)}{\\Delta x^2}\n$$\nWe want to express this amplification factor in the form:\n$$\nG_{\\mathrm{num}}(k) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\Delta t\\, D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k,\\Delta x)\\, k^2}\n$$\nBy equating the denominators of the two expressions for $G_{\\mathrm{num}}(k)$, we obtain:\n$$\n1 + \\Delta t\\, D_{\\mathrm{closure}}\\, \\lambda_h(k) = 1 + \\Delta t\\, D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k,\\Delta x)\\, k^2\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{closure}}\\, \\lambda_h(k) = D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k,\\Delta x)\\, k^2\n$$\nSolving for $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k,\\Delta x)$ yields:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k,\\Delta x) = D_{\\mathrm{closure}} \\frac{\\lambda_h(k)}{k^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_h(k)$:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k,\\Delta x) = D_{\\mathrm{closure}} \\frac{4 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)}{\\Delta x^2 k^2}\n$$\nTo analyze the leading-order deviation from $D_{\\mathrm{closure}}$ as the grid spacing $\\Delta x \\to 0$, we perform a Taylor series expansion of $\\sin(x)$ for small $x$. Let $x = \\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}$.\nThe expansion is $\\sin(x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\mathcal{O}(x^5)$.\nThen $\\sin^2(x) = \\left(x - \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\dots\\right)^2 = x^2 - \\frac{x^4}{3} + \\mathcal{O}(x^6)$.\nSubstituting back $x = \\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}$:\n$$\n\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)^4 + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^6) = \\frac{k^2 \\Delta x^2}{4} - \\frac{k^4 \\Delta x^4}{48} + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^6)\n$$\nNow we substitute this into the expression for $\\lambda_h(k)$:\n$$\n\\lambda_h(k) = \\frac{4}{\\Delta x^2} \\left[ \\frac{k^2 \\Delta x^2}{4} - \\frac{k^4 \\Delta x^4}{48} + \\dots \\right] = k^2 - \\frac{k^4 \\Delta x^2}{12} + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^4)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expanded $\\lambda_h(k)$ into the expression for $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k,\\Delta x) = D_{\\mathrm{closure}} \\frac{k^2 - \\frac{k^4 \\Delta x^2}{12} + \\dots}{k^2} = D_{\\mathrm{closure}} \\left(1 - \\frac{k^2 \\Delta x^2}{12} + \\mathcal{O}((\\Delta x)^4)\\right)\n$$\nThe leading-order deviation from $D_{\\mathrm{closure}}$ is $-\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{closure}} k^2 \\Delta x^2}{12}$. This demonstrates that the second-order centered finite difference scheme is hypodiffusive ($D_{\\mathrm{eff}}  D_{\\mathrm{closure}}$ for $k \\ne 0$), meaning it applies less diffusion than intended, especially at higher wavenumbers (or for coarser grids), and that the error in the diffusivity is second-order in the grid spacing $\\Delta x$.\n\n### Task B: Analytical Beam Evolution\n\nWe solve the one-dimensional diffusion equation $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial n^2}$ with the Gaussian initial condition $u(n,0) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n^2}{w_0^2}\\right)$.\nThis is a standard problem, most elegantly solved using Fourier transforms. Let $\\hat{u}(k,t)$ be the Fourier transform of $u(n,t)$. The PDE transforms to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial t} = -D_{\\mathrm{phys}} k^2 \\hat{u}(k,t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation in time for each wavenumber $k$, with the solution:\n$$\n\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\hat{u}(k,0) e^{-D_{\\mathrm{phys}} k^2 t}\n$$\nThe Fourier transform of the initial condition, a Gaussian $A_0 e^{-n^2/w_0^2}$ (where $A_0=1$), is also a Gaussian:\n$$\n\\hat{u}(k,0) = \\mathcal{F}\\left[e^{-n^2/w_0^2}\\right](k) = \\sqrt{\\pi} w_0 e^{-k^2 w_0^2 / 4}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the time-evolved solution in Fourier space:\n$$\n\\hat{u}(k,t) = \\left(\\sqrt{\\pi} w_0 e^{-k^2 w_0^2 / 4}\\right) e^{-D_{\\mathrm{phys}} k^2 t} = \\sqrt{\\pi} w_0 e^{-k^2 \\left(\\frac{w_0^2}{4} + D_{\\mathrm{phys}} t\\right)}\n$$\nTo find the solution in physical space, we recognize that this is the Fourier transform of a Gaussian of the form $u(n,t) = A(t) e^{-n^2/w(t)^2}$. Its transform is $\\hat{u}(k,t) = A(t) \\sqrt{\\pi} w(t) e^{-k^2 w(t)^2 / 4}$.\nBy comparing the two expressions for $\\hat{u}(k,t)$, we equate the terms in the exponent and the pre-factors.\nFrom the exponent:\n$$\n\\frac{w(t)^2}{4} = \\frac{w_0^2}{4} + D_{\\mathrm{phys}} t \\implies w(t)^2 = w_0^2 + 4 D_{\\mathrm{phys}} t\n$$\nThus, the analytical width is:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{anal}}(t) = \\sqrt{w_0^2 + 4 D_{\\mathrm{phys}} t}\n$$\nFrom the pre-factor:\n$$\nA(t) \\sqrt{\\pi} w(t) = \\sqrt{\\pi} w_0 \\implies A(t) = \\frac{w_0}{w(t)}\n$$\nThus, the analytical center amplitude is:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{anal}}(t) = \\frac{w_0}{\\sqrt{w_0^2 + 4 D_{\\mathrm{phys}} t}}\n$$\n\n### Task C: Numerical Experiment and Assessment\n\nThe numerical simulation will be performed using a spectral method. The core principle is to evolve the solution in the Fourier domain where the diffusion operator becomes a simple multiplication.\n\n1.  **Discretization**: A periodic domain of length $L = N \\Delta x$ is discretized into $N$ points. We define a centered spatial grid $n_j = \\Delta x (j - N/2)$ for $j=0, \\dots, N-1$. The corresponding wavenumbers are given by $k_m = 2\\pi m / L$ for $m=-N/2, \\dots, N/2-1$, which are conveniently generated by `numpy.fft.fftfreq`.\n\n2.  **Initialization**: The initial Gaussian profile $u(n,0)$ is evaluated on the discrete grid $n$. To use the `numpy.fft` library correctly with our centered spatial grid, the spatial data must be reordered from `[-N/2, ..., N/2-1]` to `[0, ..., N/2-1, -N/2, ..., -1]` order before the transform using `ifftshift`, and the output must be shifted back using `fftshift`.\n\n3.  **Time Evolution**: The solution is advanced from $t=0$ to $t=T$ in $N_{\\mathrm{steps}} = T/\\Delta t$ steps. In Fourier space, each step corresponds to multiplying the Fourier coefficients $\\hat{u}(k)$ by the amplification factor $G_{\\mathrm{num}}(k)$. After $N_{\\mathrm{steps}}$, the final state in Fourier space is $\\hat{u}(k,T) = \\hat{u}(k,0) \\cdot [G_{\\mathrm{num}}(k)]^{N_{\\mathrm{steps}}}$.\n\n4.  **Final State Analysis**:\n    *   The numerical solution $u(n,T)$ is recovered by applying the inverse Fast Fourier Transform to $\\hat{u}(k,T)$.\n    *   The numerical amplitude $A_{\\mathrm{num}}(T)$ is the maximum value of the computed profile $u(n,T)$.\n    *   The numerical width $w_{\\mathrm{num}}(T)$ is calculated using the discrete second-moment estimator:\n        $$\n        w_{\\mathrm{num}}^2(T) = \\frac{2 \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} n_j^2 u(n_j,T)}{\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} u(n_j,T)}\n        $$\n        where the sum is over all grid points.\n    *   The error metrics $\\varepsilon_w = w_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - w_{\\mathrm{anal}}(T)$ and $\\varepsilon_A = A_{\\mathrm{num}}(T) - A_{\\mathrm{anal}}(T)$ quantify the discrepancy between the numerical and analytical results.\n    *   The ratio $R_D = D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(k_{\\mathrm{rms}},\\Delta x)/D_{\\mathrm{phys}}$ is computed using the formula for $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ from Task A, evaluated at the root-mean-square wavenumber of the initial Gaussian, $k_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{2}/w_0$. This ratio directly measures the numerical scheme's accuracy at the dominant scale of the beam. A ratio less than $1$ indicates hypodiffusion, which causes the numerical beam to spread slower and decay less than its analytical counterpart.\n\nThis procedure provides a complete framework for quantifying the numerical error introduced by the spatial discretization of the Laplacian operator.",
