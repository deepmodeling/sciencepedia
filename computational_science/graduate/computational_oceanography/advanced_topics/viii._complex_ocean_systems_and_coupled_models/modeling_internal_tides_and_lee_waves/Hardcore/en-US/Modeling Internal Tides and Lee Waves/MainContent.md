## Introduction
Internal tides and [lee waves](@entry_id:274386) are ubiquitous forms of internal gravity waves that play a pivotal role in the ocean's energy budget and mixing processes. Generated by the interaction of ocean currents with seafloor topography, these waves transport energy over vast distances before breaking and fueling the turbulence that helps sustain the global ocean circulation. However, the multi-scale nature of these waves, from their large-scale generation to their small-scale dissipation, presents a significant challenge for both theoretical understanding and numerical modeling. This article provides a comprehensive overview of these critical phenomena, designed to build a solid foundation for graduate-level study in computational oceanography. In the following chapters, we will first explore the fundamental **Principles and Mechanisms** that govern their existence, from the Boussinesq equations to the conditions for generation and propagation. We will then examine their real-world impact through various **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, including their role in climate models and remote sensing. Finally, a series of **Hands-On Practices** will allow you to apply these concepts to concrete problems, bridging the gap between theory and numerical implementation.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The generation, propagation, and dissipation of internal tides and [lee waves](@entry_id:274386) are governed by the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics applied to a rotating, stratified medium. Understanding these phenomena requires a systematic development, starting from the governing equations of motion and proceeding through the characteristics of the waves themselves to the specific mechanisms of their creation and eventual decay. This chapter elucidates these core principles and mechanisms, forming the theoretical foundation for the numerical modeling techniques discussed subsequently.

### Governing Equations and Fundamental Approximations

The dynamics of oceanic internal waves are described by the Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid on a rotating sphere, subject to gravitational and buoyancy forces. For mesoscale and sub-mesoscale phenomena like internal tides and [lee waves](@entry_id:274386), these equations are often simplified through a series of well-justified approximations.

#### The Rotating Boussinesq Equations

The most common framework for modeling [internal waves](@entry_id:261048) is the **Boussinesq approximation**. This approximation is valid for flows where density variations are small compared to a reference density. It makes two critical simplifying assumptions:
1.  Density variations are neglected everywhere except where they are coupled with gravity, i.e., in the buoyancy term. In all other terms, such as inertia ($\rho \frac{D\boldsymbol{u}}{Dt}$), density $\rho$ is replaced by a constant reference density $\rho_0$.
2.  The fluid motion is treated as kinematically incompressible, which filters out high-frequency sound waves. This simplifies the mass conservation equation to the [divergence-free](@entry_id:190991) condition, $\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = 0$.

Under these assumptions, and adopting a local Cartesian coordinate system on an **$f$-plane** (where the Coriolis parameter $f$ is constant) and making the **[traditional approximation](@entry_id:1133287)** (neglecting the vertical component of the Coriolis force), we arrive at the rotating Boussinesq equations. We define a background state in hydrostatic balance, $\partial_z \bar{p} = -\bar{\rho}(z)g$, and consider perturbations from this state. The motion is then described by the evolution of the velocity components $(u, v, w)$ and the **buoyancy** $b$, defined as $b = -g\rho'/\rho_0$, where $\rho'$ is the density perturbation. The pressure perturbation $p'$ is not evolved in time but is diagnosed at each step to enforce the [incompressibility constraint](@entry_id:750592).

The resulting set of equations, which serve as the basis for many numerical models, are:
$$
\frac{D u}{D t} - f v = -\frac{1}{\rho_0}\partial_x p' + \mathcal{D}_u
$$
$$
\frac{D v}{D t} + f u = -\frac{1}{\rho_0}\partial_y p' + \mathcal{D}_v
$$
$$
\frac{D w}{D t} = -\frac{1}{\rho_0}\partial_z p' + b + \mathcal{D}_w
$$
$$
\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0
$$
$$
\frac{D b}{D t} + N^2 w = \mathcal{D}_b
$$
Here, $D/Dt = \partial_t + \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla$ is the [material derivative](@entry_id:266939), and the $\mathcal{D}$ terms represent sub-grid scale diffusion or friction. The term $N^2w$ in the buoyancy equation arises from the advection of the background density gradient by the vertical velocity, where $N^2(z) = -\frac{g}{\rho_0}\frac{d\bar{\rho}}{dz}$ is the squared **Brunt-Väisälä frequency** or [buoyancy frequency](@entry_id:1121933). In this system, $(u,v,w,b)$ are the **prognostic variables** that are integrated forward in time, while the pressure perturbation $p'$ is a **diagnostic variable**. 

#### The Hydrostatic Approximation

For motions whose horizontal scales are much larger than their vertical scales, the vertical momentum equation can be further simplified. The **hydrostatic approximation** consists of neglecting the vertical acceleration term, $Dw/Dt$. The vertical momentum equation then reduces to a simple diagnostic balance between the vertical pressure gradient and buoyancy:
$$
0 = -\frac{1}{\rho_0}\partial_z p' + b
$$
This approximation is valid when vertical accelerations are negligible. A [scale analysis](@entry_id:1131264) reveals two key conditions for its validity: (1) the frequency of the motion $\omega$ must be much less than the buoyancy frequency $N$ ($\omega^2 \ll N^2$), and (2) the aspect ratio of the motion (vertical scale to horizontal scale) must be small.

Whether a hydrostatic model is appropriate depends critically on the phenomenon being simulated. For a typical low-mode internal tide in the deep ocean, with a frequency $\omega \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-4} \text{ s}^{-1}$ and a horizontal wavelength of hundreds of kilometers, in a region where $N \approx 5 \times 10^{-3} \text{ s}^{-1}$, the condition $\omega^2 \ll N^2$ is strongly satisfied. Vertical accelerations are indeed negligible, and a hydrostatic model is highly accurate. In contrast, for [lee waves](@entry_id:274386) generated by a flow of $U \approx 0.5 \text{ m/s}$ over topography with a wavelength of $\lambda_h \approx 500 \text{ m}$, the intrinsic frequency of the waves, $\omega_{int} \approx U (2\pi/\lambda_h)$, can be comparable to $N$. In this case, vertical accelerations are significant, and a **non-hydrostatic** model that retains the full vertical momentum equation is required to capture the wave dynamics correctly. 

### The Stratified and Rotating Environment

The ability of the ocean to support [internal waves](@entry_id:261048) and the character of those waves are dictated by two fundamental properties of the environment: stratification and background rotation.

#### Static Stability and Buoyancy Frequency

The stratification of the ocean is the vertical variation in density. Its [local stability](@entry_id:751408) is quantified by the [buoyancy frequency](@entry_id:1121933), $N$. Imagine a small fluid parcel at rest in a background density field $\bar{\rho}(z)$. If displaced vertically by a small distance $\eta$, it retains its original density while the surrounding fluid has density $\bar{\rho}(z+\eta)$. The resulting [buoyancy force](@entry_id:154088) either restores the parcel to its original position or accelerates it further away.

This leads to three regimes:
-   **Stable Stratification**: If density decreases with height ($d\bar{\rho}/dz  0$), then $N^2 > 0$. The restoring force leads to vertical oscillations at frequency $N$. This is the necessary condition for the existence of [internal gravity waves](@entry_id:185206).
-   **Unstable Stratification**: If density increases with height ($d\bar{\rho}/dz > 0$), then $N^2  0$. Any small displacement grows exponentially, leading to convection and turbulent mixing. Internal waves cannot propagate.
-   **Neutral Stratification**: If density is uniform with height ($d\bar{\rho}/dz = 0$), then $N^2=0$. There is no restoring force, and the medium cannot support internal gravity waves. This is typical of surface mixed layers.

The propagation of internal waves is thus confined to stably stratified regions of the ocean, and their properties are intimately linked to the local value of $N$. 

#### Nondimensional Parameters and Dynamical Regimes

To understand the balance of forces in a given flow scenario, it is invaluable to perform a scale analysis of the governing equations. This process yields a set of nondimensional numbers that characterize the dynamical regime. For flow over topography with characteristic speed $U$, horizontal scale $L$, and vertical scale $H$, interacting with a topographic feature of height $h$, the most important parameters are:

-   The **Rossby number**, $Ro = U/(fL)$, which measures the ratio of inertial to Coriolis forces. For $Ro \ll 1$, rotation dominates, and the flow is nearly in geostrophic balance. For $Ro \gg 1$, the flow is ageostrophic, and rotation is negligible.
-   The **Burger number**, $Bu = (NH/fL)^2 = (L_d/L)^2$, where $L_d=NH/f$ is the internal Rossby radius of deformation. This parameter compares the influence of stratification to that of rotation. For $Bu \gg 1$, the horizontal scale is small compared to the Rossby radius, and stratification effects dominate the response. For $Bu \ll 1$, rotation is the dominant organizing influence.
-   The **topographic Froude number**, $Fr = U/(Nh)$, which measures the ratio of the flow's kinetic energy to the potential energy required to lift fluid parcels over the topographic obstacle. If $Fr  1$ ([subcritical flow](@entry_id:276823)), the flow may not have enough energy to pass over the obstacle and can be blocked. If $Fr > 1$ (supercritical flow), the flow can surmount the obstacle, often generating strong, nonlinear [lee waves](@entry_id:274386) or hydraulic phenomena.

By evaluating these parameters for a specific problem, a modeler can anticipate the dominant physical processes at play. For instance, a scenario with $Ro \sim 0.5$, $Bu \sim 0.6$, and $Fr \sim 1.25$ indicates a regime where inertia, rotation, and stratification are all of comparable importance, and the flow over topography is supercritical and likely to be nonlinear. 

### Internal Wave Kinematics and Dynamics

Internal waves exhibit unique properties that stem directly from the anisotropic nature of their restoring forces (gravity and Coriolis).

#### The Dispersion Relation and Propagation Conditions

The relationship between a wave's frequency $\omega$ and its wavevector $\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y, m)$ is given by the **dispersion relation**. For internal [inertia-gravity waves](@entry_id:1126476) in a uniformly stratified and rotating fluid, this is:
$$
\omega^2 = \frac{N^2 (k_x^2 + k_y^2) + f^2 m^2}{k_x^2 + k_y^2 + m^2} = \frac{N^2 k_h^2 + f^2 m^2}{k_h^2 + m^2}
$$
where $k_h = \sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$ is the horizontal wavenumber and $m$ is the vertical wavenumber.

For a wave to propagate vertically and carry energy, its vertical wavenumber $m$ must be real, meaning $m^2 > 0$. Rearranging the dispersion relation shows that this condition is only met when the frequency $\omega$ lies within the band bounded by the inertial and buoyancy frequencies:
$$
f  |\omega|  N
$$
If a wave's frequency is outside this band (i.e., $\omega > N$ or $\omega  f$), its vertical wavenumber becomes imaginary. The wave is **evanescent**, meaning its amplitude decays exponentially in the vertical direction, and it cannot propagate energy away from its source. In a continuously stratified ocean where $N=N(z)$, a wave propagating vertically will encounter a **turning depth** where $\omega = N(z)$, at which point it reflects. 

#### Anisotropic Propagation: Phase and Group Velocity

A remarkable and defining feature of internal waves is their anisotropic [energy propagation](@entry_id:202589). The **phase velocity**, $\mathbf{c}_p$, describes the speed and direction of movement of crests and troughs and is parallel to the [wavevector](@entry_id:178620) $\mathbf{k}$. The **[group velocity](@entry_id:147686)**, $\mathbf{c}_g = \nabla_{\mathbf{k}}\omega$, describes the speed and direction of [energy propagation](@entry_id:202589).

For internal waves, these two velocities are not parallel. A direct calculation of the [group velocity](@entry_id:147686) vector from the dispersion relation reveals the striking result that the [group velocity](@entry_id:147686) is perpendicular to the wavevector:
$$
\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{c}_g = 0
$$
This means that energy propagates along planes of constant phase, not perpendicular to them. An internal wave disturbance generated at a localized source does not radiate energy isotropically but rather in a cross-shaped pattern, forming oblique beams aligned at an angle to the vertical determined by the wave frequency. This perpendicularity is a direct consequence of the fact that the dispersion relation only depends on the angle of the wavevector, not its magnitude. 

#### Vertical Structure: Modes and Equivalent Depth

In an ocean of finite depth $H$ with a rigid surface and bottom, the vertical structure of [internal waves](@entry_id:261048) is constrained to a [discrete set](@entry_id:146023) of **vertical modes**. The flow can be decomposed into a depth-independent **[barotropic mode](@entry_id:1121351)** (mode 0), which describes the surface tide, and an infinite set of **baroclinic modes** (modes $n=1, 2, 3, ...$), which have vertical structure (i.e., velocity reverses with depth) and represent the internal wave field.

Each [baroclinic mode](@entry_id:1121345) $n$ has a characteristic vertical structure and a corresponding long-wave phase speed, $c_n$. For a continuously stratified ocean with a rigid lid, the phase speed for the $n$-th mode is given by $c_n = NH/(n\pi)$. It is often useful to connect this to a simpler [conceptual model](@entry_id:1122832), such as a two-layer fluid. In a two-layer system with layer thicknesses $H_1$ and $H_2$ and a small density difference, the baroclinic phase speed is $c^2 \approx g' \frac{H_1 H_2}{H_1+H_2}$, where $g' = g(\rho_2-\rho_1)/\rho_0$ is the reduced gravity. This leads to the concept of an **equivalent depth**, $h_n$, defined such that $c_n^2 = g h_n$. This allows the complex dynamics of a [stratified fluid](@entry_id:201059) to be analogized to the simpler dynamics of a shallow water system with a reduced depth. The ratio of the phase speed in a simple two-layer model to that of the first baroclinic mode in a continuously stratified ocean with the same total depth and [density contrast](@entry_id:157948) depends only on the geometry of the layers, highlighting the connection between these idealized models. 

### Generation Mechanisms

The primary mechanism for generating both internal tides and [lee waves](@entry_id:274386) is the interaction of a large-scale horizontal flow with bottom topography.

#### The Fundamental Forcing Mechanism

When a horizontal flow encounters a topographic slope, the fluid is forced to move vertically to satisfy the no-normal-flow boundary condition. For a small-amplitude topographic feature $z=h(x,y)$ and a horizontal barotropic flow $\boldsymbol{U}_b$, the vertical velocity induced at the bottom is, to leading order:
$$
w_b \approx \boldsymbol{U}_b \cdot \nabla_h h
$$
where $\nabla_h$ is the horizontal [gradient operator](@entry_id:275922). This bottom vertical velocity acts as a wavemaker, pushing and pulling the stratified water column above. This disturbance then radiates away from the topography in the form of [internal gravity waves](@entry_id:185206), transferring energy from the large-scale flow into the internal wave field. This process is the fundamental mechanism of conversion from barotropic to baroclinic energy. 

#### Internal Tides versus Lee Waves

The distinction between internal tides and [lee waves](@entry_id:274386) lies in the nature of the forcing flow $\boldsymbol{U}_b$.

-   **Internal Tides** are generated by an oscillatory barotropic tidal flow, $\boldsymbol{U}_b(t) = \boldsymbol{U}_0 \cos(\omega_t t)$. The resulting disturbance and the generated internal waves have a frequency in the [laboratory frame](@entry_id:166991) equal to the tidal frequency, $\omega_{\text{lab}} = \omega_t$.

-   **Lee Waves** are generated by a steady background flow, $\boldsymbol{U}_b = \text{constant}$. The resulting internal wave pattern is stationary with respect to the topography, meaning its frequency in the laboratory frame is zero, $\omega_{\text{lab}} = 0$.

A crucial concept for understanding both is the **intrinsic frequency**, $\omega_{\text{int}}$, which is the frequency observed in a frame of reference moving with the background flow. It is related to the laboratory frequency by the Doppler shift: $\omega_{\text{int}} = \omega_{\text{lab}} - \mathbf{k}_h \cdot \mathbf{U}$. The propagation condition, $f  |\omega|  N$, must be satisfied by the intrinsic frequency.
-   For [lee waves](@entry_id:274386), $\omega_{\text{int}} = - \mathbf{k}_h \cdot \mathbf{U}$. Propagating [lee waves](@entry_id:274386) can only be generated if the flow speed and topographic scale are such that $f  |\mathbf{k}_h \cdot \mathbf{U}|  N$.
-   For internal tides in the presence of a mean flow, $\omega_{\text{int}} = \omega_t - \mathbf{k}_h \cdot \mathbf{U}$. The propagation condition becomes $f  |\omega_t - \mathbf{k}_h \cdot \mathbf{U}|  N$. 

#### Efficient Generation: Critical Slopes

The efficiency of internal wave generation is not uniform but is highly sensitive to the angle of the topographic slope. Generation is maximized when the slope of the topography matches the slope of the internal wave [energy propagation](@entry_id:202589) path. This condition is known as **criticality**.

The slope of an internal wave ray at frequency $\omega$ is given by $\sqrt{(N^2-\omega^2)/(\omega^2-f^2)}$. The criticality parameter, $\gamma$, is the ratio of the topographic slope to this ray slope. When $\gamma = 1$, the group velocity of the generated wave is parallel to the bottom. In a purely inviscid fluid, this would lead to a singularity with infinite wave amplitudes. In a real fluid with weak viscosity, this singularity is regularized by the formation of a thin, intense oscillatory boundary layer. The amplified shear and motion within this layer act as a powerful, localized source, emitting a strong, coherent internal wave beam into the ocean interior. Topography where the slope is locally critical is thus a "hotspot" for internal tide generation. Furthermore, if the critical region is spatially localized over a length $L$, it generates a wave beam whose thickness is proportional to $L$. This explains the observation of very thin, high-energy beams emanating from small-scale critical features on the seafloor. 

### Evolution and Dissipation: Nonlinear Interactions

Once generated, large-amplitude internal waves do not propagate indefinitely without changing. The nonlinear terms in the governing equations, though small, facilitate a gradual transfer of energy between different waves, a process that is crucial for the eventual dissipation of internal [wave energy](@entry_id:164626).

#### Triad Resonance and Parametric Subharmonic Instability

The primary mechanism for this energy transfer is **triad resonance**. This occurs when three waves— $(\omega_0, \mathbf{k}_0)$, $(\omega_1, \mathbf{k}_1)$, and $(\omega_2, \mathbf{k}_2)$ —satisfy the matching conditions for frequency and wavenumber simultaneously:
$$
\omega_0 = \omega_1 + \omega_2
$$
$$
\mathbf{k}_0 = \mathbf{k}_1 + \mathbf{k}_2
$$
For the interaction to be resonant, each of the three waves must also individually be a free mode of the system, meaning each $(\omega_j, \mathbf{k}_j)$ pair must satisfy the internal [wave dispersion relation](@entry_id:270310).

A particularly important class of triad resonance for the ocean's internal wave field is **Parametric Subharmonic Instability (PSI)**. This is a decay instability where a large-amplitude, low-mode "parent" wave (like a mode-1 semidiurnal internal tide, $\omega_0 = \omega_{M2}$) spontaneously transfers its energy to two smaller-scale "daughter" waves. The instability is most potent when the daughter waves are subharmonics, with frequencies close to half the parent frequency, $\omega_1 \approx \omega_2 \approx \omega_0/2$. PSI is a leading mechanism for breaking down the large-scale internal tides generated at topography and cascading their energy to smaller scales where it can be more easily dissipated by mixing. The efficiency of PSI is geographically dependent and is known to be strongest at "critical latitudes" where the [subharmonic](@entry_id:171489) frequency is close to the local inertial frequency, i.e., $\omega_0/2 \approx f$.
