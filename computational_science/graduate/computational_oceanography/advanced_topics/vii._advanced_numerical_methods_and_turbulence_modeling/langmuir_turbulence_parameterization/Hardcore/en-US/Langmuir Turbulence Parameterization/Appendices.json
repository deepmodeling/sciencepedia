            "problem": "You are tasked with deriving and implementing, from first principles appropriate for linear surface gravity waves, a numerical method to estimate the surface Stokes drift speed $U_{s0}$ from omnidirectional wave buoy spectra and to compute the turbulent Langmuir number $La_t$ using shipboard friction velocity measurements $u_*$. Your derivation must begin from the definition of the Lagrangian mean drift for linear random waves and the deep-water dispersion relation. You must then design a discretization that is appropriate for a buoy-resolved frequency spectrum and implement it in a program.\n\nUse only the following bases as starting points:\n- The linear surface gravity wave deep-water dispersion relation $\\,\\omega^2 = g k\\,$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the wavenumber magnitude, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.\n- The definition of the Lagrangian mean drift velocity (Stokes drift) for a linear random wave field as a functional of the wave energy spectrum, evaluated at the ocean surface, and the standard definition of the turbulent Langmuir number $La_t$ in terms of friction velocity and surface Stokes drift.\n- The statistical relation that connects significant wave height $H_s$ to spectral variance $m_0$ via $\\,m_0 = H_s^2/16\\,$, and that an omnidirectional buoy spectrum $S(f)$ integrates over all wave directions.\n\nYour program must:\n- Construct an omnidirectional wave spectrum $S(f)$ using the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) model for the frequency range and parameters defined below.

A unique numerical solution can be obtained for each test case.\n\n**1. Theoretical Derivation**\n\nThe primary objective is to derive a computable expression for the surface Stokes drift speed, $U_{s0}$, and the turbulent Langmuir number, $La_t$, from an omnidirectional wave spectrum, $S(f)$.\n\n**1.1. Surface Stokes Drift from a Wave Spectrum**\n\nThe Lagrangian mean drift velocity, or Stokes drift, $\\vec{U}_s(z)$, for a random, directional linear wave field at a depth $z$ below the mean surface is defined as an integral over the directional wave variance spectrum, $S(\\omega, \\theta)$:\n$$ \\vec{U}_s(z) = \\iint 2\\omega k e^{2kz} S(\\omega, \\theta) \\vec{d}(\\theta) \\, d\\omega \\, d\\theta $$\nHere, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the wavenumber magnitude, $\\vec{d}(\\theta)$ is a unit vector in the direction of wave propagation $\\theta$, and $S(\\omega, \\theta)$ is the directional spectrum of sea surface elevation variance with units of m$^2$/(rad/s)/rad. We are interested in the drift at the surface, $z=0$, which simplifies the expression to:\n$$ \\vec{U}_{s0} = \\iint 2\\omega k S(\\omega, \\theta) \\vec{d}(\\theta) \\, d\\omega \\, d\\theta $$\nThe problem provides an omnidirectional wave spectrum, $S(f)$, measured in Hz, which is related to the directional angular frequency spectrum by $S(f) = 2\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} S(\\omega, \\theta) d\\theta$ where $\\omega=2\\pi f$. With only omnidirectional data, it is not possible to compute the vector Stokes drift $\\vec{U}_{s0}$. A necessary and standard approximation is to assume that the entire wave field propagates in a single, dominant direction. This allows us to compute the *magnitude* of the surface Stokes drift, $U_{s0} = |\\vec{U}_{s0}|$, by integrating over the omnidirectional spectrum $S(\\omega) = \\int S(\\omega, \\theta)d\\theta$:\n$$ U_{s0} = \\int 2\\omega k S(\\omega) d\\omega $$\nThe problem is set in deep water, so we use the linear deep-water dispersion relation:\n$$ \\omega^2 = gk $$\nwhere $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. We can solve for the wavenumber $k$ as a function of frequency:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\omega^2}{g} $$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $U_{s0}$:\n$$ U_{s0} = \\int 2\\omega \\left(\\frac{\\omega^2}{g}\\right) S(\\omega) \\, d\\omega = \\frac{2}{g} \\int \\omega^3 S(\\omega) \\, d\\omega $$\nThe provided spectrum is a function of cyclical frequency $f$ in Hz. We must convert the integral accordingly using the relationships $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ and $S(\\omega)d\\omega = S(f)df$, which implies $S(\\omega) = S(f) \\frac{df}{d\\omega} = \\frac{S(f)}{2\\pi}$. Substituting these into the integral:\n$$ U_{s0} = \\frac{2}{g} \\int_{f_{min}}^{f_{max}} (2\\pi f)^3 \\left(\\frac{S(f)}{2\\pi}\\right) (2\\pi df) $$\n$$ U_{s0} = \\frac{2}{g} \\int_{f_{min}}^{f_{max}} (2\\pi)^3 f^3 S(f) \\, df $$\nThis is the final integral expression for the surface Stokes drift speed in terms of the omnidirectional frequency spectrum $S(f)$.\n\n**1.2. Turbulent Langmuir Number**\n\nThe turbulent Langmuir number, $La_t$, is a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the relative importance of shear-driven turbulence (from wind stress) to wave-driven turbulence (Langmuir circulation). It is defined as:\n$$ La_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{u_*}{U_{s0}}} $$\nwhere $u_*$ is the friction velocity at the water surface, a measure of wind stress, and $U_{s0}$ is the surface Stokes drift speed derived above.\n\n**2. Numerical Implementation Strategy**\n\nThe derived formulae must be implemented numerically. The overall algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case.\n\n**2.1. JONSWAP Spectrum Construction**\n\nThe omnidirectional wave spectrum $S(f)$ is modeled using the JONSWAP formulation:\n$$ S(f) = \\alpha \\, \\frac{g^2}{(2\\pi)^4}\\, f^{-5} \\, \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{5}{4}\\,\\left(\\frac{f_p}{f}\\right)^{4}\\right)\\; \\gamma^{\\;\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(f/f_p - 1)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)} $$\nwhere $f_p$ is the peak frequency, $\\gamma$ is the peak enhancement factor, and $\\sigma$ is a shape parameter defined as $\\sigma = 0.07$ for $f \\le f_p$ and $\\sigma = 0.09$ for $f  f_p$. The parameter $\\alpha$ is a normalization constant.\n\n**2.2. Spectrum Normalization**\n\nThe constant $\\alpha$ must be determined such that the total variance of the spectrum, $m_0$, matches the variance derived from the given significant wave height, $H_s$.\nThe target variance is:\n$$ m_0 = \\frac{H_s^2}{16} $$\nWe first compute the un-normalized spectrum, $S_{un}(f)$, by setting $\\alpha=1$ in the JONSWAP formula. Then, we calculate the variance of this un-normalized spectrum, $m_{0,un}$, by numerical integration over the specified frequency grid [$f_{min}, f_{max}$]:\n$$ m_{0,un} = \\int_{f_{min}}^{f_{max}} S_{un}(f) \\, df $$\nThe normalization constant $\\alpha$ is then found by:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{m_0}{m_{0,un}} = \\frac{H_s^2/16}{m_{0,un}} $$\nThe fully normalized spectrum is $S(f) = \\alpha S_{un}(f)$.\n\n**2.3. Numerical Integration**\n\nBoth integrals for $m_{0,un}$ and $U_{s0}$ are computed numerically over the discrete frequency grid $f_i$ for $i=0, \\dots, N$. The frequency grid is given as uniform with $f_{\\min} = 0.04$ Hz, $f_{\\max} = 0.50$ Hz, and $\\Delta f = 0.005$ Hz. The trapezoidal rule is a suitable method for this task, offering better accuracy than a simple Riemann sum. For a function $Y(f)$, its integral is approximated as:\n$$ \\int Y(f) \\, df \\approx \\Delta f \\left( \\frac{Y(f_0) + Y(f_N)}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} Y(f_i) \\right) $$\n\n**2.4. Final Calculation**\n\nWith the normalized spectrum $S(f_i)$ defined on the grid, the surface Stokes drift $U_{s0}$ is calculated by discretizing its integral form:\n$$ U_{s0} \\approx \\sum_{i} \\frac{2(2\\pi)^3 f_i^3}{g} S(f_i) \\, \\Delta f $$\n(using the trapezoidal rule for the summation). Finally, the Langmuir number is computed using the given friction velocity $u_*$:\n$$ La_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{u_*}{U_{s0}}} $$\nThe results for $U_{s0}$ and $La_t$ for each case are rounded to six decimal places as required.",

The water is subjected to constant mechanical forcing for $t = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$ by a steady wind stress and a steady Stokes drift associated with a fixed sea state. Assume zero surface buoyancy flux, horizontally homogeneous conditions, and that the mixed layer remains horizontally uniform with a sharp base. Let the friction velocity be $u_*$ and the surface Stokes drift be $U_{s0}$. Consider two parameterizations of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) input per unit horizontal area (integrated over the mixed layer): a wind-shear production proportional to $\\rho_0 u_*^3$ and a Langmuir-turbulence production proportional to $\\rho_0 u_*^2 U_{s0}$, where $\\rho_0$ is a constant reference density.\n\nStarting from mixed-layer energetics, equate a fixed entrainment efficiency fraction $C_e$ of the total TKE input (wind and, when included, Langmuir) to the rate of increase of gravitational potential energy required to deepen the mixed layer into the layer of buoyancy jump $\\Delta b$.

There are no contradictions in the setup. The problem is self-contained.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the energy balance for the mixed layer. A fixed fraction $C_e$ of the total turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) input per unit area is converted into potential energy by entraining denser water from below the mixed layer. This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d(PE)}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = C_e \\times (\\text{Total TKE input per unit area})\n$$\nThe rate of increase of gravitational potential energy per unit area for a mixed layer of depth $h(t)$ deepening into a layer with buoyancy jump $\\Delta b$ is given as $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 \\Delta b \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}[h(t)^2]$. The total TKE input per unit area is the sum of the contributions from wind shear and Langmuir turbulence.\n\nLet $P_{TKE}$ be the total TKE input per unit area. The energy balance equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_0 \\Delta b \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left[h(t)^2\\right] = C_e P_{TKE}\n$$\nThe reference density $\\rho_0$ can be divided out if we define the TKE input rate per unit mass, let's call it $P = P_{TKE}/\\rho_0$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta b \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left[h(t)^2\\right] = C_e P\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for $h(t)^2$. Since the forcing terms ($u_*$, $U_{s0}$) are constant, $P$ is constant in time. We can rearrange and integrate the equation from $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left[h(t)^2\\right] = \\frac{2 C_e P}{\\Delta b}\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{h(0)^2}^{h(t)^2} \\mathrm{d}(h^2) = \\int_0^t \\frac{2 C_e P}{\\Delta b} \\mathrm{d}t'\n$$\n$$\nh(t)^2 - h(0)^2 = \\frac{2 C_e P}{\\Delta b} t\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $h(0) = h_0$, we obtain the solution for $h(t)$:\n$$\nh(t)^2 = h_0^2 + \\frac{2 C_e P}{\\Delta b} t\n$$\n$$\nh(t) = \\sqrt{h_0^2 + \\frac{2 C_e P}{\\Delta b} t}\n$$\nWe now apply this general solution to the two specified scenarios.

The vertical coordinate is $z$ (in meters), defined positive downward from the ocean surface. Assume horizontally homogeneous conditions, neutral stratification, and constant surface stress characterized by the friction velocity $u_*$.\n\nStarting point for the derivation:\n- Begin from the Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) budget in steady state and horizontally homogeneous conditions, where the balance simplifies to production minus dissipation when turbulent transport divergence is negligible. In symbols, use the local equilibrium assumption $P_{\\text{tot}}(z) = \\varepsilon(z)$, where $P_{\\text{tot}}(z)$ is the sum of all TKE production mechanisms and $\\varepsilon(z)$ is the TKE dissipation rate.\n- Assume the near-surface similarity for the mean shear under constant stress, with friction velocity $u_*$ and von Kármán constant $\\kappa$, together implying that the shear production scales with $1/z$.\n- Represent Langmuir turbulence production as an added mechanism tied to wave Stokes drift $u_s(z)$ and $u_*$, with the same $1/z$ near-surface structure. The Stokes drift profile decays exponentially with depth according to deep-water linear wave theory.\n\nClosures to be derived and used:\n- Let $P_s(z)$ denote shear production, and $P_L(z)$ denote Langmuir turbulence production tied to Stokes drift. Use $u_s(z) = u_{s0} \\exp\\left(-2 k_w z\\right)$, where $u_{s0}$ is the surface Stokes drift speed and $k_w$ is the wave number (both scientifically plausible and physically consistent).\n- Use a mixing-length closure with $l(z) = \\min\\left(\\kappa z, l_{\\max}\\right)$, where $l_{\\max}$ is a cap representing finite eddy size in the surface boundary layer.\n- Use a dissipation closure $\\varepsilon(z) = c_\\varepsilon \\, k(z)^{3/2} / l(z)$, where $k(z)$ is the TKE and $c_\\varepsilon$ is a dimensionless constant.\n- Use an eddy viscosity closure $K_m(z) = c_\\mu \\, k(z)^2 / \\varepsilon(z)$, where $c_\\mu$ is a dimensionless constant.\n\nDefinition of mixed layer depth:\n- Define the mixed layer depth (MLD) as the greatest depth $z$ in $[0,H]$ at which $K_m(z) \\ge K_{\\text{thresh}}$, where $H$ is the domain depth and $K_{\\text{thresh}}$ is a prescribed threshold eddy viscosity.

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction and application of a one-dimensional, steady-state turbulence closure model for the ocean surface boundary layer to compute the mixed layer depth (MLD). Two scenarios are considered: one with only shear production of Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE), and another that includes an additional parameterization for Langmuir turbulence. The derivation proceeds from first principles and standard turbulence closure assumptions.\n\n**1. Derivation of TKE Production Terms**\n\nThe model is based on the local equilibrium assumption for the TKE budget, $P_{\\text{tot}}(z) = \\varepsilon(z)$, where $P_{\\text{tot}}(z)$ is the total TKE production rate and $\\varepsilon(z)$ is the dissipation rate at depth $z$. The vertical coordinate $z$ is positive downwards from the surface.\n\n- **Shear Production ($P_s(z)$)**:\nUnder the assumption of a constant stress layer, the turbulent stress is given by $\\tau / \\rho_0 = u_*^2$, where $u_*$ is the friction velocity. The shear production of TKE is defined as $P_s(z) = - \\overline{u'w'} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$, where the Reynolds stress is $-\\overline{u'w'} = u_*^2$. The mean velocity shear, $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$, follows the law of the wall similarity form for a neutral boundary layer, $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa z}$, where $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant. Combining these gives the shear production:\n$$\nP_s(z) = u_*^2 \\left( \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa z} \\right) = \\frac{u_*^3}{\\kappa z}\n$$\nThis expression correctly shows that shear production scales with $u_*^3/(\\kappa z)$.\n\n- **Langmuir Production ($P_L(z)$)**:\nLangmuir turbulence is an additional source of TKE driven by the interaction of the surface wave Stokes drift with the mean current shear. The problem specifies a parameterization for this production term that captures its near-surface structure and dependence on wave properties. Following the problem statement, this term scales with $u_* u_s(z)^2 / (\\kappa z)$, where $u_s(z)$ is the Stokes drift. The explicit form is given as:\n$$\nP_L(z) = c_L \\frac{u_* u_s(z)^2}{\\kappa z}\n$$\nHere, $u_s(z) = u_{s0} \\exp(-2 k_w z)$ is the Stokes drift profile, with $u_{s0}$ being the surface value and $k_w$ the dominant wavenumber of the surface waves. The dimensionless proportionality constant is explicitly provided as $c_L$.\n\n- **Total Production ($P_{\\text{tot}}(z)$)**:\nThe total production is the sum of shear and Langmuir production terms.\nWithout Langmuir turbulence, the total production is simply the shear production, $P_{\\text{tot}}(z) = P_s(z)$.\nWith Langmuir turbulence, the total production is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{tot}}(z) = P_s(z) + P_L(z) = \\frac{u_*^3}{\\kappa z} + c_L \\frac{u_* u_s(z)^2}{\\kappa z} = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa z} \\left( u_*^2 + c_L u_s(z)^2 \\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Turbulent Kinetic Energy ($k(z)$)**\n\nWe use the provided dissipation closure, $\\varepsilon(z) = c_\\varepsilon k(z)^{3/2} / l(z)$, where $l(z)$ is the turbulence mixing length and $c_\\varepsilon$ is a dimensionless constant. By substituting this into the local equilibrium equation $P_{\\text{tot}}(z) = \\varepsilon(z)$, we get:\n$$\nP_{\\text{tot}}(z) = c_\\varepsilon \\frac{k(z)^{3/2}}{l(z)}\n$$\nSolving for the TKE, $k(z)$, we obtain:\n$$\nk(z)^{3/2} = \\frac{l(z) P_{\\text{tot}}(z)}{c_\\varepsilon}\n$$\n$$\nk(z) = \\left( \\frac{l(z) P_{\\text{tot}}(z)}{c_\\varepsilon} \\right)^{2/3}\n$$\nThis expression allows for the direct calculation of the TKE profile from the production and mixing length profiles.\n\n**3. Eddy Viscosity and Computational Model**\n\nThe eddy viscosity, $K_m(z)$, which represents the turbulent transport of momentum, is parameterized using the TKE and its dissipation rate:\n$$\nK_m(z) = c_\\mu \\frac{k(z)^2}{\\varepsilon(z)}\n$$\nwhere $c_\\mu$ is a dimensionless constant. To obtain a more direct computational form, we substitute the expression for $k(z)$ from the previous step and use $\\varepsilon(z) = P_{\\text{tot}}(z)$:\n$$\nK_m(z) = c_\\mu \\frac{\\left[ \\left( \\frac{l(z) P_{\\text{tot}}(z)}{c_\\varepsilon} \\right)^{2/3} \\right]^2}{P_{\\text{tot}}(z)} = c_\\mu \\frac{\\left( \\frac{l(z) P_{\\text{tot}}(z)}{c_\\varepsilon} \\right)^{4/3}}{P_{\\text{tot}}(z)}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression yields:\n$$\nK_m(z) = \\frac{c_\\mu}{c_\\varepsilon^{4/3}} l(z)^{4/3} P_{\\text{tot}}(z)^{1/3}\n$$\nSince the problem specifies $c_\\varepsilon = 1.0$, the expression simplifies further to:\n$$\nK_m(z) = c_\\mu \\, l(z)^{4/3} P_{\\text{tot}}(z)^{1/3}\n$$\nThe computational procedure involves discretizing the vertical domain $z \\in [z_0, H]$ into $N$ grid points. For each grid point $z_i$:\n1.  Calculate the mixing length: $l(z_i) = \\min(\\kappa z_i, l_{\\max})$, with $l_{\\max} = f_l H$.\n2.  Calculate the total production $P_{\\text{tot}}(z_i)$ for two scenarios:\n    a. Without Langmuir effects: $P_{\\text{tot, noL}}(z_i) = u_*^3 / (\\kappa z_i)$.\n    b. With Langmuir effects: $P_{\\text{tot, L}}(z_i) = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa z_i} \\left( u_*^2 + c_L (u_{s0} e^{-2 k_w z_i})^2 \\right)$.\n3.  Use these values to compute the eddy viscosity profile $K_m(z_i)$ for both scenarios using the derived formula.\n\n**4. Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) Calculation**\n\nThe mixed layer depth is defined as the greatest depth $z$ within the domain $[0, H]$ where the eddy viscosity $K_m(z)$ is greater than or equal to a threshold value, $K_{\\text{thresh}}$. Our computational domain is $[z_0, H]$. The algorithm to determine the MLD from the discrete profile $K_m(z_i)$ is as follows:\n1.  For the computed profile $K_m(z_i)$, identify all depths $z_i$ that satisfy the condition $K_m(z_i) \\ge K_{\\text{thresh}}$.\n2.  If no depths satisfy the condition, the MLD is defined as $0$.\n3.  Otherwise, the MLD is the maximum depth among those that satisfy the condition. This corresponds to the $z$ value of the last grid point from the surface for which the condition holds.\n4.  If the condition holds for all points up to $z=H$, the MLD is reported as $H$.\n\nThis procedure is applied separately to the $K_m$ profiles computed with and without Langmuir turbulence to determine the respective mixed layer depths, ${\\rm MLD}_{\\text{L}}$ and ${\\rm MLD}_{\\text{noL}}$.",
