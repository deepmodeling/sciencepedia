            "problem": "In a one-dimensional idealized transect used in computational oceanography to benchmark numerical differentiation algorithms, consider an analytic, nondimensional velocity profile $u(x) = x^2$ sampled on a uniform grid $x_{i} = x_{0} + i\\,h$ with constant grid spacing $h > 0$. You are interested in approximating the spatial derivative $u^{\\prime}(x)$ at the interior grid point $x_{i}$ using the three canonical finite difference schemes: a one-sided forward difference at $x_{i}$, a one-sided backward difference at $x_{i}$, and a centered difference at $x_{i}$.\n\nStarting from first principles, namely the definition of the derivative $u^{\\prime}(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{u(x+h) - u(x)}{h}$ and the Taylor series expansion of $u(x)$ about $x_{i}$, derive the truncation error at $x_{i}$ for each of the three schemes when applied to $u(x) = x^{2}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in numerical analysis, specifically the derivation of truncation errors for finite difference schemes applied to a simple polynomial function. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nWe begin by defining the given function and its derivatives, which are required for the analysis. The velocity profile is given by the function $u(x) = x^{2}$.\nThe first few derivatives are:\n- First derivative: $u^{\\prime}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^{2}) = 2x$\n- Second derivative: $u^{\\prime\\prime}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x) = 2$\n- Third derivative: $u^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(2) = 0$\nAll derivatives of order three and higher are zero for this function. The exact value of the derivative at the grid point $x_{i}$ is therefore $u^{\\prime}(x_{i}) = 2x_{i}$.\n\nThe truncation error is defined as $\\mathcal{T}(x_{i};h) = \\mathcal{D}u(x_{i}) - u^{\\prime}(x_{i})$, where $\\mathcal{D}u(x_{i})$ represents the finite difference approximation of the derivative. We will now derive this for each of the three specified schemes.\n\n**1. Forward Difference Scheme**\n\nThe one-sided forward difference approximation for $u^{\\prime}(x_{i})$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{f}u(x_{i}) = \\frac{u(x_{i}+h) - u(x_{i})}{h}\n$$\nThe grid points are defined such that $x_{i+1} = x_i + h$, so $u(x_i+h)$ is the value of the function at the next grid point. Applying this formula to the function $u(x) = x^{2}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{f}u(x_{i}) = \\frac{(x_{i}+h)^{2} - x_{i}^{2}}{h}\n$$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{f}u(x_{i}) = \\frac{(x_{i}^{2} + 2x_{i}h + h^{2}) - x_{i}^{2}}{h} = \\frac{2x_{i}h + h^{2}}{h}\n$$\nSimplifying by factoring out $h$ (since $h > 0$):\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{f}u(x_{i}) = 2x_{i} + h\n$$\nThe truncation error $\\mathcal{T}_{f}$ for the forward difference scheme is the difference between this approximation and the exact derivative $u^{\\prime}(x_{i}) = 2x_{i}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}_{f}(x_{i};h) = \\mathcal{D}_{f}u(x_{i}) - u^{\\prime}(x_{i}) = (2x_{i} + h) - 2x_{i} = h\n$$\nThus, the truncation error for the forward difference scheme is exactly $h$.\n\n**2. Backward Difference Scheme**\n\nThe one-sided backward difference approximation for $u^{\\prime}(x_{i})$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{b}u(x_{i}) = \\frac{u(x_{i}) - u(x_{i}-h)}{h}\n$$\nThe grid point $x_{i-1} = x_i - h$. Applying this formula to $u(x) = x^{2}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{b}u(x_{i}) = \\frac{x_{i}^{2} - (x_{i}-h)^{2}}{h}\n$$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{b}u(x_{i}) = \\frac{x_{i}^{2} - (x_{i}^{2} - 2x_{i}h + h^{2})}{h} = \\frac{2x_{i}h - h^{2}}{h}\n$$\nSimplifying by factoring out $h$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{b}u(x_{i}) = 2x_{i} - h\n$$\nThe truncation error $\\mathcal{T}_{b}$ for the backward difference scheme is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}_{b}(x_{i};h) = \\mathcal{D}_{b}u(x_{i}) - u^{\\prime}(x_{i}) = (2x_{i} - h) - 2x_{i} = -h\n$$\nThus, the truncation error for the backward difference scheme is exactly $-h$.\n\n**3. Centered Difference Scheme**\n\nThe centered difference approximation for $u^{\\prime}(x_{i})$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{c}u(x_{i}) = \\frac{u(x_{i}+h) - u(x_{i}-h)}{2h}\n$$\nApplying this formula to $u(x) = x^{2}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{c}u(x_{i}) = \\frac{(x_{i}+h)^{2} - (x_{i}-h)^{2}}{2h}\n$$\nExpanding the terms in the numerator:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{c}u(x_{i}) = \\frac{(x_{i}^{2} + 2x_{i}h + h^{2}) - (x_{i}^{2} - 2x_{i}h + h^{2})}{2h} = \\frac{4x_{i}h}{2h}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\mathcal{D}_{c}u(x_{i}) = 2x_{i}\n$$\nThe truncation error $\\mathcal{T}_{c}$ for the centered difference scheme is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}_{c}(x_{i};h) = \\mathcal{D}_{c}u(x_{i}) - u^{\\prime}(x_{i}) = 2x_{i} - 2x_{i} = 0\n$$\nThus, the truncation error for the centered difference scheme is exactly $0$.\n\nThis result can also be understood from the general Taylor series derivation of the centered difference error. The leading error term for a general function $u(x)$ is proportional to $u^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x_{i})$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}_{c}(x_{i};h) = \\frac{h^{2}}{6}u^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x_{i}) + \\mathcal{O}(h^{4})\n$$\nSince for our function $u(x) = x^{2}$, we have $u^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(x) = 0$ for all $x$, the leading error term vanishes, as do all higher-order terms in the error expansion. This confirms the result that the scheme is exact for any quadratic polynomial.\n\n**Conclusion on Scheme Accuracy**\n\nBased on the derived truncation errors:\n- Forward difference error: $\\mathcal{T}_{f} = h$\n- Backward difference error: $\\mathcal{T}_{b} = -h$\n- Centered difference error: $\\mathcal{T}_{c} = 0$\n\nThe scheme that is exact for the profile $u(x)=x^2$ is the **centered difference scheme**, as its truncation error is identically zero. Consequently, for any nonzero grid spacing $h$, the centered difference scheme is also the **closest to exact**; its approximation equals the true derivative, whereas the forward and backward schemes have errors of magnitude $|h|$.\n\nThe final answer is the set of truncation errors for the forward, backward, and centered difference schemes, respectively, presented as a row matrix.",

For clarity, we use the notation $u_i = u(x_i)$ and $u_0^{(k)} = u^{(k)}(x_0)$.\n\n**Part 1: First-Order Accurate Approximation**\n\nTo derive an approximation for $u'(x_0)$ using $u_0$ and $u_1$, we begin with the Taylor series expansion of $u(x)$ at $x_1$ expanded around $x_0$:\n$$u(x_1) = u(x_0 + h_0) = u(x_0) + h_0 u'(x_0) + \\frac{h_0^2}{2!} u''(x_0) + O(h_0^3)$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $u'(x_0)$ gives:\n$$h_0 u'(x_0) = u(x_1) - u(x_0) - \\frac{h_0^2}{2} u''(x_0) - O(h_0^3)$$\n$$u'(x_0) = \\frac{u(x_1) - u(x_0)}{h_0} - \\frac{h_0}{2} u''(x_0) - O(h_0^2)$$\nThe first-order one-sided approximation for $u'(x_0)$, which we denote $D_1(u)$, is the first term on the right-hand side:\n$$D_1(u) = \\frac{u_1 - u_0}{h_0}$$\nThis is the standard forward difference formula. The truncation error, $T_1$, is defined as the approximation minus the exact value, $T_1 = D_1(u) - u'(x_0)$. From the rearranged Taylor expansion, we find:\n$$T_1 = \\frac{h_0}{2} u''(x_0) + O(h_0^2)$$\nThe leading truncation error term is thus $\\frac{h_0}{2} u''(x_0)$, and the approximation is first-order accurate, as indicated by the error being proportional to $h_0^1$.\n\n**Part 2: Second-Order Accurate Approximation**\n\nWe seek a linear combination of $u_0$, $u_1$, and $u_2$ that approximates $u'(x_0)$:\n$$u'(x_0) \\approx D_2(u) = A u_0 + B u_1 + C u_2$$\nTo determine the coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$, we expand $u_1$ and $u_2$ in Taylor series around $x_0$:\n$$u_1 = u(x_0 + h_0) = u_0 + h_0 u'_0 + \\frac{h_0^2}{2} u''_0 + \\frac{h_0^3}{6} u'''_0 + O(h_0^4)$$\n$$u_2 = u(x_0 + h_0 + h_1) = u_0 + (h_0 + h_1)u'_0 + \\frac{(h_0 + h_1)^2}{2} u''_0 + \\frac{(h_0 + h_1)^3}{6} u'''_0 + O((h_0+h_1)^4)$$\nSubstituting these expansions into the expression for $D_2(u)$ yields:\n$$D_2(u) = A u_0 + B\\left(u_0 + h_0 u'_0 + \\frac{h_0^2}{2} u''_0 + \\dots\\right) + C\\left(u_0 + (h_0 + h_1)u'_0 + \\frac{(h_0 + h_1)^2}{2} u''_0 + \\dots\\right)$$\nCollecting terms by the derivatives of $u$ at $x_0$:\n$$D_2(u) = (A+B+C)u_0 + (B h_0 + C(h_0+h_1))u'_0 + \\left(B \\frac{h_0^2}{2} + C \\frac{(h_0+h_1)^2}{2}\\right)u''_0 + \\left(B \\frac{h_0^3}{6} + C \\frac{(h_0+h_1)^3}{6}\\right)u'''_0 + \\dots$$\nFor $D_2(u)$ to be a second-order accurate approximation of $u'_0$, the coefficients must satisfy the following system of equations:\n1.  Coefficient of $u_0$: $A+B+C = 0$\n2.  Coefficient of $u'_0$: $B h_0 + C(h_0+h_1) = 1$\n3.  Coefficient of $u''_0$: $B h_0^2 + C(h_0+h_1)^2 = 0$\n\nFrom equation (3), we express $B$ in terms of $C$:\n$$B = -C \\frac{(h_0+h_1)^2}{h_0^2}$$\nSubstitute this into equation (2):\n$$\\left(-C \\frac{(h_0+h_1)^2}{h_0^2}\\right) h_0 + C(h_0+h_1) = 1$$\n$$-C \\frac{(h_0+h_1)^2}{h_0} + C(h_0+h_1) = 1$$\n$$C(h_0+h_1) \\left(1 - \\frac{h_0+h_1}{h_0}\\right) = 1$$\n$$C(h_0+h_1) \\left(\\frac{h_0 - h_0 - h_1}{h_0}\\right) = 1$$\n$$C(h_0+h_1) \\left(\\frac{-h_1}{h_0}\\right) = 1 \\implies C = -\\frac{h_0}{h_1(h_0+h_1)}$$\nNow, we find $B$:\n$$B = -\\left(-\\frac{h_0}{h_1(h_0+h_1)}\\right) \\frac{(h_0+h_1)^2}{h_0^2} = \\frac{h_0+h_1}{h_0 h_1}$$\nFinally, from equation (1), we find $A$:\n$$A = -B - C = -\\frac{h_0+h_1}{h_0 h_1} + \\frac{h_0}{h_1(h_0+h_1)}$$\n$$A = \\frac{-(h_0+h_1)^2 + h_0^2}{h_0 h_1 (h_0+h_1)} = \\frac{-(h_0^2 + 2h_0 h_1 + h_1^2) + h_0^2}{h_0 h_1 (h_0+h_1)} = \\frac{-2h_0 h_1 - h_1^2}{h_0 h_1 (h_0+h_1)}$$\n$$A = \\frac{-h_1(2h_0 + h_1)}{h_0 h_1 (h_0+h_1)} = -\\frac{2h_0 + h_1}{h_0(h_0+h_1)}$$\nThe second-order approximation is:\n$$D_2(u) = -\\frac{2h_0 + h_1}{h_0(h_0+h_1)} u_0 + \\frac{h_0+h_1}{h_0 h_1} u_1 - \\frac{h_0}{h_1(h_0+h_1)} u_2$$\nThe truncation error is $T_2 = D_2(u) - u'_0$. Based on our setup, the terms with $u_0$, $u'_0$, and $u''_0$ are zero or one as required, so the leading term of the error comes from the $u'''_0$ term:\n$$T_2 = \\left(B \\frac{h_0^3}{6} + C \\frac{(h_0+h_1)^3}{6}\\right)u'''_0 + O(h^3)$$\nwhere $h$ represents the scale of the grid spacings $h_0$ and $h_1$.

The definition is\n$$\nG_x[\\eta]_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta x}\\Big( \\eta_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j+\\tfrac{1}{2}} - \\eta_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2},j+\\tfrac{1}{2}} + \\eta_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j-\\tfrac{1}{2}} - \\eta_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2},j-\\tfrac{1}{2}} \\Big).\n$$\nWe need to evaluate the four terms in the parentheses by substituting the checkerboard mode definition. The indices for $\\eta$ are shifted from the corner index $(i,j)$. Note that the fractional parts of the indices do not affect the calculation; we use $i$ and $j$ from $(i+\\frac{1}{2}, j+\\frac{1}{2})$ in the exponent of $(-1)^{i+j}$.\nThe terms are:\n1.  $\\eta_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j+\\tfrac{1}{2}} = A(-1)^{i+j}$\n2.  $\\eta_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2},j+\\tfrac{1}{2}} = A(-1)^{(i-1)+j} = A(-1)^{i+j-1} = -A(-1)^{i+j}$\n3.  $\\eta_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j-\\tfrac{1}{2}} = A(-1)^{i+(j-1)} = A(-1)^{i+j-1} = -A(-1)^{i+j}$\n4.  $\\eta_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2},j-\\tfrac{1}{2}} = A(-1)^{(i-1)+(j-1)} = A(-1)^{i+j-2} = A(-1)^{i+j}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $G_x[\\eta]_{i,j}$:\n$$\nG_x[\\eta]_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta x}\\Big( A(-1)^{i+j} - \\big( -A(-1)^{i+j} \\big) + \\big( -A(-1)^{i+j} \\big) - A(-1)^{i+j} \\Big)\n$$\n$$\nG_x[\\eta]_{i,j} = \\frac{A(-1)^{i+j}}{2\\Delta x}\\Big( 1 - (-1) + (-1) - 1 \\Big) = \\frac{A(-1)^{i+j}}{2\\Delta x}\\Big( 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 \\Big) = \\frac{A(-1)^{i+j}}{2\\Delta x}(0) = 0.\n$$\nThis holds for all corner points $(i,j)$. Thus, the entire field $G_x[\\eta]$ is identically zero.\n\nNext, we compute the $y$-component of the discrete gradient, $G_y[\\eta]$, at the same corner point $(i,j)$. The definition is\n$$\nG_y[\\eta]_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta y}\\Big( \\eta_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j+\\tfrac{1}{2}} - \\eta_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j-\\tfrac{1}{2}} + \\eta_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2},j+\\tfrac{1}{2}} - \\eta_{i-\\tfrac{1}{2},j-\\tfrac{1}{2}} \\Big).\n$$\nUsing the same four terms evaluated previously:\n$$\nG_y[\\eta]_{i,j} = \\frac{1}{2\\Delta y}\\Big( A(-1)^{i+j} - \\big( -A(-1)^{i+j} \\big) + \\big( -A(-1)^{i+j} \\big) - A(-1)^{i+j} \\Big)\n$$\nThis expression is identical in its structure to the one for $G_x[\\eta]_{i,j}$ apart from the denominator.\n$$\nG_y[\\eta]_{i,j} = \\frac{A(-1)^{i+j}}{2\\Delta y}\\Big( 1 - (-1) + (-1) - 1 \\Big) = \\frac{A(-1)^{i+j}}{2\\Delta y}\\Big( 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 \\Big) = \\frac{A(-1)^{i+j}}{2\\Delta y}(0) = 0.\n$$\nThis also holds for all corner points $(i,j)$, so the field $G_y[\\eta]$ is also identically zero.\n\nSince both components $G_x[\\eta]$ and $G_y[\\eta]$ are zero, the action of the discrete gradient operator $\\mathcal{G}$ on the checkerboard mode $\\eta$ yields the zero vector field:\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}[\\eta] = (G_x[\\eta], G_y[\\eta]) = (0, 0) = \\mathbf{0}.\n$$\nNow we can evaluate the action of the normal operator $L = \\mathcal{G}^{\\ast}\\mathcal{G}$ on $\\eta$:\n$$\nL\\eta = \\mathcal{G}^{\\ast}(\\mathcal{G}\\eta) = \\mathcal{G}^{\\ast}(\\mathbf{0}).\n$$\nThe adjoint operator $\\mathcal{G}^{\\ast}$ is a linear operator. For any linear operator $T$, its action on the zero element of its domain is the zero element of its codomain, i.e., $T(0) = 0$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}^{\\ast}(\\mathbf{0}) = 0.\n$$\nThis means that\n$$\nL\\eta = 0.\n$$\nWe are looking for the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ in the equation $L\\eta = \\lambda\\eta$. Substituting our result, we have:\n$$\n\\lambda\\eta = 0.\n$$\nThe problem states that the checkerboard mode has a constant amplitude $A \\neq 0$. This implies that the field $\\eta$ is not the zero field (it takes values $+A$ and $-A$). Since $\\eta$ is a non-zero vector in the function space, the equality $\\lambda\\eta=0$ can only be satisfied if the scalar $\\lambda$ is zero.\n\nTherefore, the checkerboard mode $\\eta_{i+\\tfrac{1}{2},j+\\tfrac{1}{2}} = A(-1)^{i+j}$ is an eigenvector of the operator $L=\\mathcal{G}^{\\ast}\\mathcal{G}$, and its corresponding eigenvalue is $\\lambda = 0$. This result demonstrates that the checkerboard mode is in the nullspace of the discrete pressure gradient operator on an Arakawa B-grid, a well-known property that identifies it as a spurious computational mode.",
