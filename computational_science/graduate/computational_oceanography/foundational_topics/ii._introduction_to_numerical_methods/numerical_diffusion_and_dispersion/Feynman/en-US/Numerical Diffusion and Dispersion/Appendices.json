In the absence of physical diffusion, the exact solution transports any initial condition $c(x,0)$ without changing its shape, total mass, or spatial variance. However, discrete numerical schemes introduce numerical errors that can be decomposed into two effects: numerical diffusion (amplitude damping that reduces the variance of tracer fluctuations) and numerical dispersion (phase errors that shift or distort features without necessarily changing their amplitude). Your task is to quantify these two effects over exactly one period of advection, $T = L/u$, for a Gaussian pulse using two standard explicit schemes.\n\nImplement a program that:\n- Represents the solution on a uniform periodic grid with $N$ points, grid spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$, and time step $\\Delta t$ chosen from a specified Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy number (CFL), $\\mathrm{C} = u \\Delta t / \\Delta x$.\n- Initializes the tracer as a Gaussian pulse centered at $x_0$ with standard deviation $\\sigma$ on $[0,L)$:\n$$\nc(x,0) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(d(x;x_0))^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $d(x;x_0)$ is the minimal periodic distance between $x$ and $x_0$ on the circle $[0,L)$, so that $d \\in \\left[-\\frac{L}{2},\\frac{L}{2}\\right]$.\n- Evolves the tracer for exactly one period $T = L/u$ using one of the following conservative, periodic, finite-difference update rules (space is discretized with index $i \\in \\{0,\\dots,N-1\\}$ and time level $n$):\n    1.

            "solution": "The problem requires the quantification of numerical diffusion and dispersion for two finite-difference schemes used to solve the one-dimensional linear advection equation, $c_t + u c_x = 0$. This equation describes the transport of a passive tracer concentration, $c(x,t)$, with a constant velocity $u$ on a one-dimensional periodic domain of length $L$. The exact solution translates the initial tracer profile $c(x,0)$ without any change in shape, amplitude, or variance. Numerical schemes, however, introduce errors that manifest as numerical diffusion (a damping of amplitudes) and numerical dispersion (phase errors leading to shape distortion). The task is to compute these errors for a Gaussian initial condition after one full advective period, $T = L/u$.\n\nThe solution is developed by first discretizing the governing equation, implementing the specified numerical schemes, and then applying well-defined metrics to the initial and final states of the simulation.\n\n**1. Discretization and Simulation Setup**\n\nThe continuous domain $[0, L)$ is discretized into a uniform grid of $N$ points, indexed by $i = 0, \\dots, N-1$. The grid points are located at $x_i = i \\Delta x$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = L/N$. Time is discretized into steps of size $\\Delta t$. The relationship between spatial and temporal discretization is governed by the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number, defined as $\\mathrm{C} = u \\Delta t / \\Delta x$. For the stability of the explicit schemes used, this number must be constrained.\n\nThe simulation runs for a total duration of $T = L/u$, which corresponds to the time it takes for a feature to be advected exactly once around the periodic domain. The total number of time steps, $n_T$, is chosen such that $n_T \\Delta t = T$. By substituting the definitions of $T$, $\\Delta t$, and $\\mathrm{C}$, we find $n_T = \\frac{L/u}{( \\mathrm{C} \\Delta x / u)} = \\frac{L}{\\mathrm{C} (L/N)} = N/\\mathrm{C}$. The problem guarantees that for all test cases, $N/\\mathrm{C}$ is an integer, ensuring the simulation terminates precisely at one period.\n\n**2. Initial Condition**\n\nThe initial tracer distribution is a Gaussian pulse, given by:\n$$\nc(x,0) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(d(x;x_0))^2}{2 \\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $x_0$ is the center of the pulse, $\\sigma$ is its standard deviation, and $d(x; x_0)$ is the minimal periodic distance between any point $x$ and the center $x_0$. This distance function correctly handles the wrap-around nature of the periodic domain and is defined on the interval $[-\\frac{L}{2}, \\frac{L}{2}]$. In a discrete implementation on the grid $\\{x_i\\}$, the distance from each $x_i$ to $x_0$ is calculated as $d(x_i; x_0) = (x_i - x_0) - L \\cdot \\mathrm{round}((x_i - x_0)/L)$. This ensures the Gaussian is centered correctly and symmetrically on the circular domain.\n\n**3. Numerical Schemes**\n\nThe evolution of the discrete tracer field $c_i^n \\approx c(x_i, t^n)$ is computed using two explicit, conservative finite-difference schemes. Periodicity is enforced by using modular arithmetic on the spatial indices, such that $c_{i \\pm N}^n = c_i^n$.\n\n*   **First-Order Upwind Scheme:** For a positive velocity $u \\ge 0$, this scheme is given by:\n    $$\n    c_i^{n+1} = c_i^n - \\mathrm{C}\\left(c_i^n - c_{i-1}^n\\right)\n    $$\n    This scheme is first-order accurate in both space and time. It is known to be numerically stable for $0 \\le \\mathrm{C} \\le 1$. Its leading-order truncation error term is proportional to the second spatial derivative, which acts as a diffusion term. Consequently, this scheme is highly dissipative, causing sharp gradients to smear out and amplitudes to decay over time. In the special case where $\\mathrm{C}=1$, the scheme becomes $c_i^{n+1} = c_{i-1}^n$, which is an exact shift operator on the grid. The discrete solution is transported without any error in this case.\n\n*   **Lax–Wendroff Scheme:** This is a second-order accurate scheme in both space and time:\n    $$\n    c_i^{n+1} = c_i^n - \\frac{\\mathrm{C}}{2}\\left(c_{i+1}^n - c_{i-1}^n\\right) + \\frac{\\mathrm{C}^2}{2}\\left(c_{i+1}^n - 2 c_i^n + c_{i-1}^n\\right)\n    $$\n    The Lax–Wendroff scheme is stable for $|\\mathrm{C}| \\le 1$. It is constructed to cancel the second-order truncation error term, making it significantly less diffusive than the upwind scheme. However, its dominant error term is proportional to the third spatial derivative, which introduces dispersive errors. These errors cause different Fourier components of the solution to propagate at incorrect phase velocities, leading to spurious oscillations, particularly near sharp features.\n\nFor implementation, these update rules are applied vectorially to the entire solution array $c^n$ at each time step. The periodic shifts required for terms like $c_{i\\pm 1}^n$ are efficiently handled using array-rolling operations.\n\n**4. Quantification of Numerical Errors**\n\nTwo metrics are computed to quantify the effects of numerical diffusion and dispersion after one period, $T$.\n\n*   **Numerical Diffusion Metric ($R_{\\mathrm{var}}$):** Numerical diffusion damps the amplitude of tracer fluctuations. This effect is quantified by measuring the decay in the spatial variance of the solution. The discrete mean and variance of the tracer field at time level $n$ are:\n    $$\n    \\overline{c}^n = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} c_i^n, \\quad \\mathrm{Var}^n = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\left(c_i^n - \\overline{c}^n\\right)^2\n    $$\n    The diffusion metric is the ratio of the final variance at time $t^{n_T} = T$ to the initial variance at $t=0$:\n    $$\n    R_{\\mathrm{var}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}^{n_T}}{\\mathrm{Var}^{0}}\n    $$\n    For a perfect, non-diffusive scheme, $R_{\\mathrm{var}} = 1$. The presence of numerical diffusion leads to $R_{\\mathrm{var}}  1$.\n\n*   **Numerical Dispersion Metric ($\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{phase}}$):** Numerical dispersion causes different wavelengths to travel at incorrect speeds. This is analyzed by examining the phase of a specific Fourier mode of the solution. We focus on the mode with the longest wavelength that fits the domain, which has wavenumber $k_1 = 2\\pi/L$. The complex coefficient of this mode is found using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the zero-mean tracer field, $c_j^n - \\overline{c}^n$:\n    $$\n    \\widehat{C}_k^n = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\left(c_j^n - \\overline{c}^n\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\mathrm{i}\\, \\frac{2\\pi k j}{N}\\right)\n    $$\n    For the exact solution after one period $T=L/u$, the field returns to its original state, so the phase of any Fourier coefficient should be unchanged. Any numerical phase error is captured by the difference between the final and initial phase of the $k=1$ mode, $\\widehat{C}_1^n$. The wrapped phase difference is calculated as:\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\phi = \\mathrm{wrap}\\left(\\arg\\left(\\widehat{C}_1^{n_T}\\right) - \\arg\\left(\\widehat{C}_1^{0}\\right)\\right)\n    $$\n    where the $\\mathrm{wrap}(\\theta)$ function maps an angle $\\theta$ into the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. A phase error $\\Delta \\phi$ is equivalent to an erroneous spatial shift. A spatial shift of $\\delta x$ imparts a phase change of $-k_1 \\delta x = - (2\\pi/L) \\delta x$. Therefore, the equivalent spatial phase shift is:\n    $$\n    \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{phase}} = -\\,\\frac{L}{2\\pi}\\,\\Delta \\phi\n    $$\n    This value represents the residual displacement of the dominant large-scale feature of the tracer after one period. A non-zero $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{phase}}$ is a direct measure of the scheme's cumulative dispersive error.\n\n**5. Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  Initialize parameters ($L$, $N$, $u$, $\\mathrm{C}$, etc.).\n2.  Construct the spatial grid $x_i$ and the initial Gaussian profile $c^0$.\n3.  Compute the initial variance $\\mathrm{Var}^0$ and the initial phase $\\arg(\\widehat{C}_1^0)$.\n4.  Loop for $n_T = N/\\mathrm{C}$ time steps, applying the chosen numerical scheme (Upwind or Lax-Wendroff) at each step to update the solution vector.\n5.  After the loop, compute the final variance $\\mathrm{Var}^{n_T}$ and final phase $\\arg(\\widehat{C}_1^{n_T})$.\n6.  Calculate the metrics $R_{\\mathrm{var}}$ and $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{phase}}$ using the formulas above.\n7.  Store the resulting pair $[R_{\\mathrm{var}}, \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{phase}}]$.\n\nThis process is repeated for all four test cases, and the results are aggregated into a final list for output.",

The leapfrog scheme admits two temporal components: a smoothly varying physical mode and an alternating-in-time computational mode. A widely used stabilization in atmospheric and ocean circulation models is the Robert–Asselin time filter, which modifies the leapfrog solution at each time level by applying the update\n$$\na^{n} \\leftarrow a^{n} + \\nu\\left(a^{n+1} - 2\\,a^{n} + a^{n-1}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\nu$ is a dimensionless filter coefficient. Starting from these definitions and the properties of discrete Fourier modes, derive how this filter acts as a discrete temporal diffusion on the computational mode and a weak damping on the physical mode, expressed through their single-step amplitude multipliers.

Round your final numerical value to three significant figures, and report $\\nu$ as a pure number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the determination of the Robert–Asselin filter coefficient, $\\nu$, based on two criteria: a specified damping of the computational mode and a maximum tolerated damping of the physical mode. The analysis begins with the properties of the leapfrog time-stepping scheme and the effect of the filter on its distinct numerical modes.\n\nFirst, we analyze the leapfrog scheme applied to the linear advection equation in Fourier space. The discrete-time approximation is given as\n$$\na^{n+1} = a^{n-1} - 2\\,\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega\\,\\Delta t\\,a^{n}\n$$\nwhere $a^n$ is the complex amplitude at time step $n$, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $\\Delta t$ is the time step. This is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation. To find its modes, we seek solutions of the form $a^n = \\lambda^n a^0$, where $\\lambda$ is the amplification factor per time step. Substituting this into the equation yields the characteristic equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 + 2\\,\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega\\,\\Delta t\\,\\lambda - 1 = 0\n$$\nLet $\\Omega = \\omega\\,\\Delta t$. The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 + 2\\,\\mathrm{i}\\,\\Omega\\,\\lambda - 1 = 0$. The roots are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-2\\,\\mathrm{i}\\,\\Omega \\pm \\sqrt{(2\\,\\mathrm{i}\\,\\Omega)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2} = -\\mathrm{i}\\,\\Omega \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\Omega^2}\n$$\nFor the scheme to be stable, we require $|\\Omega| \\le 1$. In this case, we can define an angle $\\theta = \\arcsin(\\Omega)$, which implies $\\cos(\\theta) = \\sqrt{1 - \\Omega^2}$ for $\\theta \\in [-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$. The two roots, or amplification factors, are:\n$$\n\\lambda_p = \\cos(\\theta) - \\mathrm{i}\\,\\sin(\\theta) = \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\theta) \\quad (\\text{Physical mode})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_c = -\\cos(\\theta) - \\mathrm{i}\\,\\sin(\\theta) = -(\\cos(\\theta) + \\mathrm{i}\\,\\sin(\\theta)) = -\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\theta) = \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\pi)\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\theta) \\quad (\\text{Computational mode})\n$$\nThe physical mode $\\lambda_p$ approximates the true solution's amplification factor, $\\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\omega\\,\\Delta t) = \\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\,\\Omega)$. The computational mode $\\lambda_c$ is a numerical artifact, characterized by its sign alternation at each time step. Both modes have a magnitude of $|\\lambda_p| = |\\lambda_c| = 1$, meaning the leapfrog scheme is neutrally stable and does not inherently damp any mode.\n\nNext, we analyze the Robert–Asselin filter. The filter updates the value at time level $n$ using a provisional value at $n+1$:\n$$\na^{n} \\leftarrow a^{n} + \\nu\\left(a^{n+1} - 2\\,a^{n} + a^{n-1}\\right)\n$$\nTo find how this filter affects a mode with amplification factor $\\lambda$, we substitute $a^k = \\lambda^k a^0$ into the filter expression. The new filtered value, $a_{filt}^n$, is:\n$$\na_{filt}^n = \\lambda^n a^0 + \\nu\\left(\\lambda^{n+1} a^0 - 2\\,\\lambda^n a^0 + \\lambda^{n-1} a^0\\right) = \\left(1 + \\nu(\\lambda - 2 + \\lambda^{-1})\\right)\\lambda^n a^0\n$$\nThe single-step amplitude multiplier of the filter itself is therefore a function of $\\lambda$:\n$$\nD(\\lambda) = 1 + \\nu(\\lambda - 2 + \\lambda^{-1})\n$$\n\nWe apply this filter multiplier to both the computational and physical modes.\n\nFor the computational mode, its defining characteristic is the high-frequency oscillation (period of $2\\Delta t$). The damping of this mode is most critical. We evaluate the filter's effect on this quintessential $2\\Delta t$ oscillation, which corresponds to setting $\\lambda = -1$. This is also the limit of $\\lambda_c$ as $\\Omega \\to 0$.\n$$\nD_c = D(\\lambda=-1) = 1 + \\nu(-1 - 2 + (-1)^{-1}) = 1 + \\nu(-4) = 1 - 4\\nu\n$$\nThe problem specifies a desired amplitude multiplier for this mode, $d_c = 0.70$. To achieve at least this much damping, the multiplier must be less than or equal to this value: $|D_c(\\nu)| \\le d_c$. Assuming $\\nu$ is small enough that $D_c > 0$, this gives $1 - 4\\nu \\le d_c$. This establishes a lower bound for $\\nu$:\n$$\n4\\nu \\ge 1 - d_c \\implies \\nu \\ge \\frac{1 - d_c}{4}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the smallest $\\nu$ that achieves the target. This corresponds to the minimum value in the allowed range, i.e., $\\nu = (1-d_c)/4$.\n\nFor the physical mode, the filter multiplier is:\n$$\nD_p = D(\\lambda_p) = D(\\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\theta)) = 1 + \\nu(\\exp(-\\mathrm{i}\\theta) - 2 + \\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\theta)) = 1 + \\nu(2\\cos\\theta - 2) = 1 - 2\\nu(1 - \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThis multiplier represents an unwanted damping of the physical wave. The fractional amplitude loss per filter application is $L_p = 1 - |D_p|$. For small $\\nu > 0$, $D_p$ is positive and close to $1$, so $L_p = 1-D_p = 2\\nu(1 - \\cos\\theta)$.\nThe problem imposes a constraint on this loss at the highest resolved physical frequency, defined by $\\Omega_0 = \\omega_0\\Delta t = 0.60$. The allowed fractional amplitude loss is $\\epsilon = 0.03$. The constraint is $L_p(\\Omega_0) \\le \\epsilon$.\n$$\n2\\nu(1 - \\cos\\theta_0) \\le \\epsilon\n$$\nwhere $\\theta_0 = \\arcsin(\\Omega_0)$, so $\\cos\\theta_0 = \\sqrt{1-\\Omega_0^2}$. This establishes an upper bound for $\\nu$:\n$$\n\\nu \\le \\frac{\\epsilon}{2(1 - \\cos\\theta_0)} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{2(1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\Omega_0^2})}\n$$\n\nCombining the two constraints, we have a permissible range for $\\nu$:\n$$\n\\frac{1 - d_c}{4} \\le \\nu \\le \\frac{\\epsilon}{2(1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\Omega_0^2})}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the smallest value of $\\nu$ that meets the targets. This is the lower bound of the valid interval:\n$$\n\\nu_{min} = \\frac{1 - d_c}{4}\n$$\nWe must verify that this value is consistent with the upper bound.\nWe are given the numerical values:\n$d_c = 0.70$\n$\\epsilon = 0.03$\n$\\Omega_0 = \\omega_0\\Delta t = 0.60$\n\nFirst, we calculate the lower bound on $\\nu$:\n$$\n\\nu \\ge \\frac{1 - 0.70}{4} = \\frac{0.30}{4} = 0.075\n$$\nSo the smallest $\\nu$ that damps the computational mode sufficiently is $\\nu = 0.075$.\n\nNext, we calculate the upper bound on $\\nu$ from the physical mode constraint. We first find $\\cos\\theta_0$:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta_0 = \\sqrt{1 - (0.60)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.36} = \\sqrt{0.64} = 0.80\n$$\nNow we compute the upper bound:\n$$\n\\nu \\le \\frac{0.03}{2(1 - 0.80)} = \\frac{0.03}{2(0.20)} = \\frac{0.03}{0.40} = 0.075\n$$\nThe full constraint on $\\nu$ is $0.075 \\le \\nu \\le 0.075$.\nThe only value of $\\nu$ that satisfies both constraints is $\\nu = 0.075$. This is, therefore, the smallest (and only) possible value. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures, which is $0.0750$.",
