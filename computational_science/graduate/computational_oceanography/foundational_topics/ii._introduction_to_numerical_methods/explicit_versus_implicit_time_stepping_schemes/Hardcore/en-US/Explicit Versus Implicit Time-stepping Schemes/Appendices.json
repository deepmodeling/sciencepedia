Let $C_j^n$ denote the numerical approximation of $C(j\\Delta z, n\\Delta t)$.\n\n**Part 1: Explicit (FTCS) Scheme Stability Analysis**\n\nThe forward-in-time, centered-in-space (FTCS) scheme is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{C_j^{n+1} - C_j^n}{\\Delta t} = \\nu_{z} \\frac{C_{j+1}^n - 2C_j^n + C_{j-1}^n}{\\Delta z^2}\n$$\nRearranging and introducing the nondimensional diffusive Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number, $r = \\frac{\\nu_{z}\\Delta t}{\\Delta z^{2}}$, we get:\n$$\nC_j^{n+1} = C_j^n + r \\left( C_{j+1}^n - 2C_j^n + C_{j-1}^n \\right)\n$$\nFor the Fourier-mode stability analysis, we substitute a single Fourier mode, $C_j^n = A^n e^{ikj\\Delta z}$, where $A$ is the amplification factor and $k$ is the wavenumber.\n$$\nA^{n+1} e^{ikj\\Delta z} = A^n e^{ikj\\Delta z} + r \\left( A^n e^{ik(j+1)\\Delta z} - 2A^n e^{ikj\\Delta z} + A^n e^{ik(j-1)\\Delta z} \\right)\n$$\nDividing by $A^n e^{ikj\\Delta z}$ gives the amplification factor $A = A^{n+1}/A^n$:\n$$\nA = 1 + r \\left( e^{ik\\Delta z} - 2 + e^{-ik\\Delta z} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity $e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nA = 1 + 2r \\left( \\cos(k\\Delta z) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nUsing the half-angle identity $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$:\n$$\nA = 1 - 4r \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k\\Delta z}{2}\\right)\n$$\nFor stability, the magnitude of the amplification factor must not exceed unity for any wavenumber $k$, i.e., $|A| \\le 1$. Since $r  0$ and $\\sin^2(\\cdot) \\ge 0$, we have $A \\le 1$. The stability is thus limited by the condition $A \\ge -1$:\n$$\n1 - 4r \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k\\Delta z}{2}\\right) \\ge -1\n$$\n$$\n2 \\ge 4r \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k\\Delta z}{2}\\right) \\implies r \\le \\frac{1}{2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k\\Delta z}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nThis condition must hold for all $k$. The most restrictive (worst-case) scenario occurs when $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k\\Delta z}{2}\\right)$ is maximal. The maximum value is $1$, which occurs for the grid-scale Nyquist mode where $k\\Delta z = \\pi$.

Since $r  0$ and $\\sin^2(\\cdot) \\ge 0$, the denominator is always greater than or equal to $1$. Thus, $0  A_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\le 1$ for all values of $r$ and $k$. The scheme is unconditionally stable.\n\n**Part 3: Accuracy-Limited Implicit Time Step**\n\nWe first find the exact amplification factor. For a single Fourier mode $C(z,t) = \\hat{C}(t)e^{ikz}$, the PDE $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\nu_z \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial z^2}$ becomes $\\frac{d\\hat{C}}{dt} = -\\nu_z k^2 \\hat{C}$. The solution is $\\hat{C}(t) = \\hat{C}(0)\\exp(-\\nu_z k^2 t)$. The exact amplification factor over one time step $\\Delta t$ is:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{exact}} = \\exp(-\\nu_z k^2 \\Delta t)\n$$\nThe problem requires an accuracy comparison for the grid-scale mode with wavenumber $k = \\pi/\\Delta z$. For this mode, $k\\Delta z = \\pi$.\nThe implicit amplification factor for this mode is:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{imp}}(k=\\pi/\\Delta z) = \\frac{1}{1 + 4r \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1+4r}\n$$\nThe exact amplification factor for this mode is:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{exact}}(k=\\pi/\\Delta z) = \\exp\\left(-\\nu_z \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta z}\\right)^2 \\Delta t\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\pi^2 \\frac{\\nu_z \\Delta t}{\\Delta z^2}\\right) = \\exp(-\\pi^2 r)\n$$\nThe relative error constraint is $|\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{imp}} - A_{\\mathrm{exact}}}{A_{\\mathrm{exact}}}| \\le 0.1$. For diffusive schemes, the numerical scheme is typically more dissipative than the exact solution for long time steps, meaning $A_{\\mathrm{imp}}  A_{\\mathrm{exact}}$. We can verify this: the Taylor series for $A_{\\mathrm{imp}}$ is $1 - 4r + \\dots$ whereas for $A_{\\mathrm{exact}}$ it is $1 - \\pi^2 r + \\dots$. Since $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.87  4$, $A_{\\mathrm{exact}}  A_{\\mathrm{imp}}$ for small $r$. Thus, the error condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{imp}}}{A_{\\mathrm{exact}}} - 1 \\le 0.1 \\implies \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{imp}}}{A_{\\mathrm{exact}}} \\le 1.1\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the amplification factors:\n$$\n\\frac{1/(1+4r)}{\\exp(-\\pi^2 r)} \\le 1.1 \\implies (1+4r)\\exp(-\\pi^2 r) \\ge \\frac{1}{1.1}\n$$\nLet $f(r) = (1+4r)\\exp(-\\pi^2 r)$. The function $f(r)$ is monotonically decreasing for $r \\ge 0$ since $f'(r) = (4-\\pi^2 - 4\\pi^2 r)\\exp(-\\pi^2 r)  0$. Therefore, to find the largest $r$ that satisfies the inequality, we solve the equality:\n$$\n(1+4r)\\exp(-\\pi^2 r) = \\frac{1}{1.1}\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $r$. Solving it numerically (e.g., using a root-finding algorithm like Newton's method) gives $r_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\approx 0.015913$. The largest implicit time step $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{imp}}$ is based on this value of $r$.\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Computations**\n\nGiven $\\nu_z = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}$ and $\\Delta z = 1\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n1.  **Explicit Time Step Limit**:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{exp}} = \\frac{\\Delta z^2}{2\\nu_z} = \\frac{(1\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}} = \\frac{1}{0.02}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 50\\,\\mathrm{s}\n    $$\n2.  **Implicit Time Step Limit**:\n    Using the accuracy-limited CFL number $r_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\approx 0.015913$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{imp}} = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{imp}} \\Delta z^2}{\\nu_z} = \\frac{0.015913 \\times (1\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^2/s}} = 1.5913\\,\\mathrm{s}\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{imp}} = 1.591\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe largest stable explicit time step is $50\\,\\mathrm{s}$.

The equation for $x = u^{n+1}$ simplifies to:\n$$\nx + \\alpha \\lvert x \\rvert x - \\beta = 0\n$$\nThe residual function to be solved by the Newton iteration is therefore:\n$$\nR(x) = x + \\alpha \\lvert x \\rvert x - \\beta\n$$\n\n### Existence and Uniqueness of the Solution\n\nTo justify the existence and uniqueness of the solution for $u^{n+1}$, we analyze the properties of the function $g(x) = x + \\alpha \\lvert x \\rvert x$. The equation to solve is $g(x) = \\beta$.\n\nThe physical parameters $\\Delta t$, $C_d$, and $h$ are all strictly positive, so the coefficient $\\alpha = \\frac{\\Delta t C_d}{h}$ is also strictly positive.\n\nWe examine the derivative of $g(x)$ with respect to $x$. The term $\\lvert x \\rvert x$ can be written as $x^2$ for $x \\geq 0$ and $-x^2$ for $x  0$. Its derivative with respect to $x$ is $2x$ for $x0$ and $-2x$ for $x0$. At $x=0$, the function $\\lvert x \\rvert x$ is differentiable and its derivative is $0$. Thus, the derivative of $\\lvert x \\rvert x$ is $2\\lvert x \\rvert$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe derivative of $g(x)$ is then:\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (x + \\alpha \\lvert x \\rvert x) = 1 + \\alpha \\frac{d}{dx}(\\lvert x \\rvert x) = 1 + 2\\alpha \\lvert x \\rvert\n$$\nSince $\\alpha  0$ and $\\lvert x \\rvert \\geq 0$, the derivative $g'(x)$ is always greater than or equal to $1$:\n$$\ng'(x) = 1 + 2\\alpha \\lvert x \\rvert \\ge 1 \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\nA function with a strictly positive derivative is strictly monotonically increasing. A strictly monotonic function is injective (one-to-one).\n\nFurthermore, we examine the limits of $g(x)$:\n- As $x \\to \\infty$, $g(x) = x(1 + \\alpha x) \\to \\infty$.\n- As $x \\to -\\infty$, $g(x) = x(1 - \\alpha x) \\to -\\infty$.\n\nSince $g(x)$ is continuous and its range is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that for any real number $\\beta$, there exists at least one $x$ such that $g(x) = \\beta$. Combined with the strict monotonicity (which implies injectivity), we conclude that for any given $\\beta$, there exists a unique real solution $x = u^{n+1}$. This ensures the problem is well-posed.\n\n### Newton Iteration Scheme\n\nWe solve the nonlinear equation $R(x) = 0$ using the Newton-Raphson method. The iterative update formula is:\n$$\nx^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} - \\frac{R(x^{(k)})}{R'(x^{(k)})}\n$$\nwhere $x^{(k)}$ is the estimate of the root at iteration $k$.\n\n- **Residual and its Derivative**:\n  The residual is $R(x) = x + \\alpha \\lvert x \\rvert x - \\beta$.\n  Its derivative, as derived for $g'(x)$, is $R'(x) = 1 + 2\\alpha \\lvert x \\rvert$. This derivative is continuous and well-defined for all $x$, including $x=0$, where $R'(0) = 1$. The problem's requirement for a \"mathematically consistent value at $u=0$\" is naturally satisfied.\n\n- **Initial Guess**: As specified, the iteration starts with the velocity from the previous time step: $x^{(0)} = u^n$.\n\n- **Iteration Update**: The Newton step $\\Delta x^{(k)}$ is computed as:\n  $$\n  \\Delta x^{(k)} = - \\frac{R(x^{(k)})}{R'(x^{(k)})} = - \\frac{x^{(k)} + \\alpha \\lvert x^{(k)} \\rvert x^{(k)} - \\beta}{1 + 2\\alpha \\lvert x^{(k)} \\rvert}\n  $$\n  The next iterate is $x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \\Delta x^{(k)}$.\n\n- **Backtracking Line Search**: To enhance robustness, especially for poor initial guesses, a backtracking strategy is employed. If a full Newton step (step length $\\lambda=1$) does not decrease the absolute value of the residual (i.e., $|R(x^{(k+1)})| \\ge |R(x^{(k)})|$), the step length $\\lambda$ is successively halved ($\\lambda \\to \\lambda/2$). The update becomes $x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \\lambda \\Delta x^{(k)}$. This process is repeated until a smaller residual is achieved or $\\lambda$ falls below a minimum threshold.\n\n- **Termination Criteria**: The iteration terminates when any of the following conditions are met:\n  1. The absolute value of the residual is below a specified tolerance $\\epsilon_{res}$: $|R(x^{(k+1)})|  \\epsilon_{res}$.\n  2. The absolute difference between successive iterates is below a tolerance $\\epsilon_{step}$: $|x^{(k+1)} - x^{(k)}|  \\epsilon_{step}$.\n  3. A maximum number of iterations, $k_{max}$, is reached. This is a safeguard against non-convergence.\n\nThis combination of a robust Newton solver with a backtracking line search provides an efficient and reliable method for finding the unique solution $u^{n+1}$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the updated velocity u^{n+1} using a semi-implicit scheme\n    for a 1D ocean momentum model with quadratic bottom friction.\n    The resulting nonlinear scalar equation is solved with a robust Newton's method.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (general): (u^n, Δt, C_d, h, F^n)\n        (0.5, 600.0, 2.5e-3, 50.0, 1.0e-4),\n        # Case B (boundary, zero state):\n        (0.0, 600.0, 3.0e-3, 20.0, 0.0),\n        # Case C (sign change tendency):\n        (-0.2, 3600.0, 3.0e-3, 10.0, 5.0e-4),\n        # Case D (stiff friction, large time step):\n        (2.0, 21600.0, 3.0e-3, 5.0, 0.0),\n        # Case E (deep water, weak friction):\n        (-1.5, 900.0, 1.0e-3, 500.0, -2.0e-4),\n    ]\n\n    def solve_newton_step(un, dt, Cd, h, Fn):\n        \"\"\"\n        Computes u^{n+1} by solving the nonlinear equation using Newton's method.\n        The equation is R(x) = x + alpha*|x|*x - beta = 0, where x = u^{n+1}.\n        \"\"\"\n        alpha = dt * Cd / h\n        beta = un + dt * Fn\n\n        def R(x):\n            return x + alpha * np.abs(x) * x - beta\n\n        def R_prime(x):\n            return 1.0 + 2.0 * alpha * np.abs(x)\n\n        # Newton iteration parameters\n        max_iter = 100\n        tol_res = 1e-12   # Tolerance for the absolute residual\n        tol_step = 1e-12  # Tolerance for the absolute step size\n        min_lambda = 1e-5 # Minimum backtracking step factor\n\n        x_k = un  # Initial guess x^(0) = u^n\n\n        for _ in range(max_iter):\n            res_k = R(x_k)\n            \n            # Check for convergence on residual before taking the step\n            if np.abs(res_k)  tol_res:\n                return x_k\n\n            res_prime_k = R_prime(x_k)\n            # R_prime is always >= 1 for alpha > 0, so no division by zero\n\n            delta_x = -res_k / res_prime_k\n\n            # Backtracking line search\n            lam = 1.0\n            abs_res_k = np.abs(res_k)\n            \n            # Loop to find a step that reduces the residual\n            while True:\n                x_kp1 = x_k + lam * delta_x\n                res_kp1 = R(x_kp1)\n                \n                if np.abs(res_kp1)  abs_res_k:\n                    # Step accepted, break backtracking loop\n                    break\n                \n                lam /= 2.0\n                \n                # If step becomes too small, backtracking fails\n                if lam  min_lambda:\n                    # Unable to find a better point.
