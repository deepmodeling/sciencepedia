            "problem": "You are given observations of Practical Salinity ($S_P$), a unitless quantity defined by a conductivity ratio standard, at several oceanic locations specified by geographic longitude and latitude in degrees. You also have a known spatial field for the Absolute Salinity Anomaly ($\\delta S_A$), expressed as a function of longitude and latitude, that captures small deviations in seawater composition from a globally standard reference mixture. The goal is to compute the Absolute Salinity ($S_A$), expressed in grams per kilogram ($\\mathrm{g\\,kg^{-1}}$), at each observation point.\n\nStarting from definitions consistent with the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10), the Reference Salinity is constructed so that Reference Salinity ($S_R$) matches the mass fraction of dissolved material in Standard Seawater at the canonical Practical Salinity value $S_P = 35$. This sets the proportionality between $S_P$ and the reference mass fraction, encoded in a constant factor. The Absolute Salinity Anomaly $\\delta S_A$ represents the deviation in mass fraction from that reference due to spatial variations in composition, and is provided here as a known function of longitude and latitude. Your task is to derive, from these principles, a transformation from $S_P$ to $S_A$ that correctly incorporates the reference scaling and the anomaly, and to implement it numerically.\n\nUse the following scientifically plausible and self-consistent specifications:\n- Angles must be treated in degrees.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of the TEOS-10 standard for seawater, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language.

The solution requires deriving the transformation from first principles as laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe foundation of the TEOS-10 framework is that Absolute Salinity ($S_A$), the true mass fraction of dissolved solids, can be expressed as the sum of a Reference Salinity ($S_R$) and an Absolute Salinity Anomaly ($\\delta S_A$).\n$$\nS_A = S_R + \\delta S_A\n$$\nThe Reference Salinity, $S_R$, is the mass fraction of a standard reference composition of seawater that has the same Practical Salinity $S_P$ as the sample. It is defined to be directly proportional to Practical Salinity. We can express this relationship with a constant of proportionality, $u_{PS}$:\n$$\nS_R = u_{PS} \\, S_P\n$$\nThe problem provides the necessary information to determine this constant.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in classical thermodynamics, well-posed with a complete set of definitions and data, and objective in its formulation. The task is to derive and compute the adiabatic lapse rate for seawater based on a provided Gibbs function, which is a standard procedure in physical oceanography.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Adiabatic Lapse Rate $\\Gamma$\n\nThe adiabatic lapse rate, $\\Gamma$, is defined as the rate of change of temperature with respect to pressure for a parcel of fluid that does not exchange heat with its surroundings. This corresponds to a process occurring at constant specific entropy, $\\eta$, and constant Absolute Salinity, $S_A$. The mathematical definition is:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial p} \\right)_{\\eta, S_A} $$\nThroughout this derivation, $S_A$ is held constant and will be omitted from the subscripts for brevity.\n\nWe begin by considering the specific entropy $\\eta$ as a function of in-situ temperature $T$ and pressure $p$, i.e., $\\eta = \\eta(T, p)$. Its total differential is given by:\n$$ d\\eta = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial T} \\right)_p dT + \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial p} \\right)_T dp $$\nFor an isentropic (adiabatic and reversible) process, $d\\eta = 0$. Therefore:\n$$ 0 = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial T} \\right)_p dT + \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial p} \\right)_T dp $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the ratio $dT/dp$ under the condition of constant $\\eta$ yields:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial p} \\right)_{\\eta} = - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial p} \\right)_T}{\\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial T} \\right)_p} $$\nThis expression relates the adiabatic lapse rate to the partial derivatives of specific entropy. The next step is to express these derivatives in terms of the specific Gibbs free energy, $g(T, p)$.\n\nFrom the fundamental thermodynamic definitions provided:\n- Specific entropy: $\\eta = -\\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T} \\right)_p \\equiv -g_T$\n- Specific volume: $v = \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p} \\right)_T \\equiv g_p$\n\nLet's evaluate the denominator of the expression for $\\Gamma$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial T} \\right)_p = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( -g_T \\right)_p = - \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial T^2} \\equiv -g_{TT} $$\nThis term is related to the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, $c_p = T \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial T} \\right)_p = -T g_{TT}$. Since $T > 0$ and $c_p > 0$ for physical stability, it follows that $g_{TT} < 0$.\n\nNext, let's evaluate the numerator:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial p} \\right)_T = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( -g_T \\right)_T = - \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial p \\partial T} \\equiv -g_{Tp} $$\nSince the specific Gibbs function $g$ is a state function, its mixed partial derivatives are equal (by Schwarz's theorem). This constitutes a Maxwell relation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial p \\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial T \\partial p} \\implies g_{Tp} = g_{pT} $$\nWe can relate $g_{pT}$ to the thermal expansion of specific volume:\n$$ g_{pT} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p} \\right)_T = \\left( \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T} \\right)_p $$\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\Gamma$:\n$$ \\Gamma = - \\frac{-g_{Tp}}{-g_{TT}} = - \\frac{g_{Tp}}{g_{TT}} $$\nUsing the Maxwell relation $g_{Tp} = g_{pT}$:\n$$ \\Gamma = - \\frac{g_{pT}}{g_{TT}} = - \\frac{\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial T \\partial p}}{\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial T^2}} $$\nThis is the required expression for the adiabatic lapse rate in terms of the second derivatives of the specific Gibbs free energy.\n\n### Part 2: Application to the Surrogate Gibbs Function\n\nWe are given the following surrogate for the specific Gibbs free energy, where $T$ is temperature in Kelvin:\n$$ g(S_A, T, p) = - c_p(S_A)\\, T \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) + \\left[v_{00} + v_T \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) + v_S S_A\\right] p - \\frac{1}{2} \\left[\\kappa_0 + \\kappa_T \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) + \\kappa_S S_A\\right] p^2, $$\nwith $c_p(S_A) = c_{p0} + c_{pS} S_A$.\n\nWe must compute the second partial derivatives $g_{TT}$ and $g_{pT}$.\n\nFirst, the partial derivative with respect to temperature, $g_T$:\n$$ g_T = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left[-c_p(S_A) T \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)\\right] + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left[ \\dots \\right]p - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left[ \\dots \\right]p^2 $$\n$$ g_T = -c_p(S_A) \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) + T \\cdot \\frac{1}{T} \\right] + v_T p - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa_T p^2 $$\n$$ g_T = -c_p(S_A) \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{T}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) + 1 \\right] + v_T p - \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa_T p^2 $$\nNow, the second partial derivative with respect to temperature, $g_{TT}$:\n$$ g_{TT} = \\frac{\\partial g_T}{\\partial T} = -c_p(S_A) \\left[ \\frac{1}{T} \\right] = -\\frac{c_p(S_A)}{T} $$\nThis result is consistent with the thermodynamic definition $c_p = -T g_{TT}$.\n\nNext, we compute the partial derivative with respect to pressure, $g_p$:\n$$ g_p = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial p} = \\left[v_{00} + v_T \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) + v_S S_A\\right] - \\left[\\kappa_0 + \\kappa_T \\left(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\right) + \\kappa_S S_A\\right] p $$\nNow, the mixed partial derivative, $g_{pT}$:\n$$ g_{pT} = \\frac{\\partial g_p}{\\partial T} = v_T - \\kappa_T p $$\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $g_{TT}$ and $g_{pT}$ into the formula for $\\Gamma$:\n$$ \\Gamma = - \\frac{g_{pT}}{g_{TT}} = - \\frac{v_T - \\kappa_T p}{-\\frac{c_p(S_A)}{T}} $$\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{T \\left( v_T - \\kappa_T p \\right)}{c_p(S_A)} $$\nSubstituting $c_p(S_A) = c_{p0} + c_{pS} S_A$, we arrive at the final expression for numerical computation:\n$$ \\Gamma(S_A, T, p) = \\frac{T \\left( v_T - \\kappa_T p \\right)}{c_{p0} + c_{pS} S_A} $$\nHere, $T$ must be in Kelvin.
