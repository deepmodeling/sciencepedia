The provided numerical values are physically realistic for mid-latitude ocean eddies. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe horizontal momentum equations for an inviscid fluid on a rotating planet (the $f$-plane approximation) are derived from Newton's second law. The law states that the mass times acceleration of a fluid parcel is equal to the sum of forces acting on it. In a frame rotating with the Earth, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{D\\mathbf{u}}{Dt} + 2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p + \\mathbf{g} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector in the rotating frame, $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla$ is the material derivative, $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$ is the Earth's angular velocity vector, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $p$ is pressure, and $\\mathbf{g}$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nFor a horizontal flow with velocity $\\mathbf{u}_h = u\\mathbf{i} + v\\mathbf{j}$, the horizontal components of the momentum equation, neglecting friction, are:\n$$ \\frac{Du}{Dt} = fv - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} $$\n$$ \\frac{Dv}{Dt} = -fu - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} $$\nwhere $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and the material derivative for horizontal motion is $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$. We assume a Boussinesq fluid, so density $\\rho$ is treated as a constant reference density $\\rho_0$ in the momentum equations. The full equations are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = fv - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = -fu - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} $$\n\nNext, we nondimensionalize these equations using the given characteristic scales. Let primed variables denote nondimensional quantities:\n$u = Uu'$, $v = Uv'$, $x = Lx'$, $y = Ly'$, $t = (L/U)t'$.\nWe also introduce a characteristic scale for the dynamic pressure variations, $P_0$, such that $p = P_0 p'$.\n\nThe derivatives transform as:\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{U}{L}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t'}$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{L}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x'}$, and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{L}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y'}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the $x$-momentum equation:\n$$ \\frac{U}{L}\\frac{\\partial (Uu')}{\\partial t'} + (Uu')\\frac{1}{L}\\frac{\\partial (Uu')}{\\partial x'} + (Uv')\\frac{1}{L}\\frac{\\partial (Uu')}{\\partial y'} = f(Uv') - \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 L}\\frac{\\partial (P_0 p')}{\\partial x'} $$\nFactoring out the characteristic scales from each term:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{U^2}{L}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t'} + u'\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x'} + v'\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial y'}\\right) = (fU)v' - \\left(\\frac{P_0}{\\rho_0 L}\\right)\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x'} $$\nThe problem specifies that the pressure scale $P_0$ should be chosen to make the Coriolis and pressure-gradient terms of the same order of magnitude. The characteristic magnitude of the Coriolis term is $fU$, and that of the pressure-gradient term is $P_0/(\\rho_0 L)$. Equating them gives:\n$$ fU = \\frac{P_0}{\\rho_0 L} \\implies P_0 = \\rho_0 f L U $$\nThis choice defines the geostrophic scaling for pressure.\n\nTo obtain the final nondimensional equation, we divide by the characteristic magnitude of the Coriolis force per unit mass, which is $fU$:\n$$ \\frac{U^2/L}{fU}\\left(\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t'} + u'\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x'} + v'\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial y'}\\right) = \\frac{fU}{fU}v' - \\frac{P_0/(\\rho_0 L)}{fU}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x'} $$\nSimplifying the coefficients:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{U}{fL}\\right)\\left(\\frac{D u'}{D t'}\\right) = v' - \\frac{\\rho_0 f L U / (\\rho_0 L)}{fU}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x'} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{U}{fL}\\right)\\frac{D u'}{D t'} = v' - \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x'} $$\nSimilarly, the $y$-momentum equation becomes:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{U}{fL}\\right)\\frac{D v'}{D t'} = -u' - \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial y'} $$\n\nThe nondimensional parameter multiplying the acceleration term $\\frac{D\\mathbf{u}'_h}{Dt'}$ is identified as $\\frac{U}{fL}$. This parameter is known as the Rossby number, denoted by $Ro$.\n$$ Ro = \\frac{U}{fL} $$\nThe Rossby number represents the ratio of the inertial forces (acceleration) to the Coriolis force.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of the Rossby number using the provided data:\n$U = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n$L = 50\\,\\mathrm{km} = 50 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$f = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\n$$ Ro = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{(10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{0.5}{10^{-4} \\times 5 \\times 10^4} = \\frac{0.5}{5} = 0.1 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the value is $0.100$.\n\nFinally, we assess the appropriate force balance. The nondimensional momentum equations are:\n$$ Ro\\frac{D u'}{D t'} = v' - \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x'} $$\n$$ Ro\\frac{D v'}{D t'} = -u' - \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial y'} $$\nOur calculated Rossby number is $Ro = 0.1$. Since $Ro \\ll 1$, the acceleration terms, which are of order $Ro$, are an order of magnitude smaller than the Coriolis and pressure gradient terms, which are of order $1$. To leading order, we can neglect the terms multiplied by $Ro$. This results in the geostrophic balance:\n$$ 0 \\approx v' - \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x'} $$\n$$ 0 \\approx -u' - \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial y'} $$\nCyclogeostrophic balance includes the advective part of the acceleration term, which is physically important in flows with strong curvature (e.g., eddies). This balance is $Ro(u'\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x'} + v'\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial y'}) = v' - \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x'}$ (in the radial direction for a circular flow). Since the advective acceleration is part of the $\\mathcal{O}(Ro)$ term, cyclogeostrophic balance represents a first-order correction to the geostrophic balance. Therefore, for $Ro=0.1$, the most appropriate balance *to leading order* is geostrophic balance.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical value of the identified nondimensional parameter.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part response: first, deriving the relationship for the surface geostrophic velocity; second, calculating the ratio of geostrophic velocities at two different latitudes; and third, interpreting the physical consequences of this change.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Geostrophic Velocity Relationship**\n\nThe starting point is the horizontal momentum equation for a steady, inviscid fluid on a rotating frame, under the Boussinesq approximation. The equation is:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h) \\mathbf{u}_h + f \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\mathbf{u}_h = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla_h p\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}_h$ is the horizontal velocity vector, $\\nabla_h$ is the horizontal gradient operator, $f = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$ is the Coriolis parameter (with $\\Omega$ being Earth's rotation rate and $\\phi$ the latitude), $\\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$ is the local vertical unit vector, $\\rho_0$ is the constant reference density, and $p$ is the pressure. The term $(\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h) \\mathbf{u}_h$ represents advective acceleration.\n\nGeostrophic balance is achieved when the advective acceleration is negligible compared to the Coriolis and pressure gradient forces. This is characteristic of large-scale, slow-moving flows where the Rossby number is small. The problem states to assume purely geostrophic balance, so we neglect the advective term $(\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h) \\mathbf{u}_h$. The geostrophic velocity, denoted $\\mathbf{u}_g$, thus satisfies:\n$$\nf \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\mathbf{u}_g = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla_h p\n$$\nNext, we relate the horizontal pressure gradient $\\nabla_h p$ to the sea surface height (SSH) $\\eta(x,y)$. We use the hydrostatic balance approximation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g\n$$\nwhere $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $\\rho$ is the fluid density. Within the Boussinesq approximation for a surface flow, we consider the density to be the constant reference density, $\\rho = \\rho_0$. Integrating the hydrostatic equation from an arbitrary depth $z$ up to the sea surface $z=\\eta(x,y)$ gives:\n$$\n\\int_z^{\\eta} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z'} dz' = \\int_z^{\\eta} -\\rho_0 g \\, dz'\n$$\n$$\np(z=\\eta) - p(z) = -\\rho_0 g (\\eta-z)\n$$\nThe pressure at the surface is the atmospheric pressure, $p(z=\\eta) = p_{atm}$. Assuming $p_{atm}$ is spatially uniform, we can write the pressure at any depth $z$ as:\n$$\np(x,y,z) = p_{atm} + \\rho_0 g (\\eta(x,y) - z)\n$$\nThe horizontal pressure gradient $\\nabla_h p$ is found by taking the horizontal gradient of this expression:\n$$\n\\nabla_h p = \\nabla_h (p_{atm} + \\rho_0 g \\eta - \\rho_0 g z)\n$$\nAs $p_{atm}$, $\\rho_0$, and $g$ are constants, and $z$ is an independent coordinate, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla_h p = \\rho_0 g \\nabla_h \\eta\n$$\nThis shows that the horizontal pressure gradient is directly proportional to the slope of the sea surface and is constant with depth.\n\nSubstituting this result for $\\nabla_h p$ into the geostrophic balance equation:\n$$\nf \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\mathbf{u}_g = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} (\\rho_0 g \\nabla_h \\eta) = -g \\nabla_h \\eta\n$$\nTo solve for $\\mathbf{u}_g$, we take the cross product of this equation with $\\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times (f \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\mathbf{u}_g) = \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times (-g \\nabla_h \\eta)\n$$\nUsing the vector triple product identity $\\mathbf{A} \\times (\\mathbf{B} \\times \\mathbf{C}) = (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{C})\\mathbf{B} - (\\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B})\\mathbf{C}$, we get:\n$$\nf [(\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_g)\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} - (\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{k}})\\mathbf{u}_g] = -g (\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\nabla_h \\eta)\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{u}_g$ is a horizontal velocity, it is perpendicular to the vertical vector $\\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$, so $\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_g = 0$. Also, $\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\cdot \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} = 1$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n-f \\mathbf{u}_g = -g (\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\nabla_h \\eta)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}_g = \\frac{g}{f} (\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\nabla_h \\eta)\n$$\nThis is the vector expression for the geostrophic velocity. To find its magnitude $|\\mathbf{u}_g|$, we have:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{u}_g| = \\left| \\frac{g}{f} \\right| |\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\nabla_h \\eta|\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{\\hat{k}}$ is perpendicular to the horizontal vector $\\nabla_h \\eta$, the magnitude of their cross product is $|\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\nabla_h \\eta| = |\\mathbf{\\hat{k}}| |\\nabla_h \\eta| \\sin(90^{\\circ}) = |\\nabla_h \\eta|$. Assuming the flow is in the northern hemisphere where $\\phi > 0$, the Coriolis parameter $f = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$ is positive, so $|f|=f$. The relationship for the magnitude of the geostrophic velocity is thus:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{u}_g| = \\frac{g}{f} |\\nabla \\eta|\n$$\nwhere for clarity we use $\\nabla\\eta$ to denote the horizontal gradient $\\nabla_h\\eta$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Ratio**\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{|\\mathbf{u}_{g}(\\phi_{2})|}{|\\mathbf{u}_{g}(\\phi_{1})|}$ for latitudes $\\phi_{1}=45^{\\circ}$ and $\\phi_{2}=10^{\\circ}$. The problem states that the SSH gradient magnitude $|\\nabla \\eta|$ is constant. The parameters $g$ and $\\Omega$ are also constant.\nUsing the derived relationship and the expression for the Coriolis parameter, $f=2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{u}_g(\\phi_1)| = \\frac{g}{2\\Omega\\sin\\phi_1} |\\nabla \\eta|\n$$\n$$\n|\\mathbf{u}_g(\\phi_2)| = \\frac{g}{2\\Omega\\sin\\phi_2} |\\nabla \\eta|\n$$\nThe ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{g}{2\\Omega\\sin\\phi_2} |\\nabla \\eta|}{\\frac{g}{2\\Omega\\sin\\phi_1} |\\nabla \\eta|} = \\frac{\\sin\\phi_1}{\\sin\\phi_2}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $\\phi_1 = 45^{\\circ}$ and $\\phi_2 = 10^{\\circ}$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\sin(45^{\\circ})}{\\sin(10^{\\circ})}\n$$\nWe evaluate the trigonometric functions: $\\sin(45^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707107$ and $\\sin(10^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.173648$.\n$$\nR \\approx \\frac{0.707107}{0.173648} \\approx 4.07207\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as requested, we get $R = 4.072$.\n\n**Part 3: Physical Interpretation**\n\nThe ratio $R \\approx 4.072$ indicates that for a constant sea surface slope $|\\nabla \\eta|$, the geostrophic current speed must be more than four times faster at latitude $10^{\\circ}$ than at $45^{\\circ}$. This has profound implications for the validity of the geostrophic balance itself.\n\nThe geostrophic approximation is valid when the Rossby number, $Ro = \\frac{U}{fL}$ (where $U$ is a characteristic velocity and $L$ a characteristic length scale), is much less than $1$. The Rossby number quantifies the ratio of the magnitude of the advective acceleration term $|(\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h) \\mathbf{u}_h| \\sim U^2/L$ to the Coriolis term $|f \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\mathbf{u}_h| \\sim fU$.\n\nIn our case, the characteristic velocity $U$ is the geostrophic speed $|\\mathbf{u}_g|$. We found that $|\\mathbf{u}_g| \\propto 1/f$. Therefore, the Rossby number scales as:\n$$\nRo \\propto \\frac{|\\mathbf{u}_g|}{f} \\propto \\frac{1/f}{f} = \\frac{1}{f^2}\n$$\nAs a parcel of fluid moves from $\\phi_1 = 45^{\\circ}$ to $\\phi_2 = 10^{\\circ}$, the Coriolis parameter $f=2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$ decreases. The Rossby number will consequently increase. The ratio of the Rossby numbers at the two latitudes is:\n$$\n\\frac{Ro(\\phi_2)}{Ro(\\phi_1)} \\propto \\frac{f(\\phi_1)^2}{f(\\phi_2)^2} = \\left(\\frac{2\\Omega\\sin\\phi_1}{2\\Omega\\sin\\phi_2}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sin\\phi_1}{\\sin\\phi_2}\\right)^2 = R^2\n$$\nWith $R \\approx 4.072$, we find $R^2 \\approx 16.58$. This means the Rossby number increases by a factor of more than $16$.\n\nThis dramatic increase in the Rossby number signifies that the advective acceleration term, which was negligible at $45^{\\circ}$ (assuming $Ro \\ll 1$), may no longer be small compared to the Coriolis force at $10^{\\circ}$. The full momentum balance, which includes the advective acceleration, is known as the cyclogeostrophic balance:\n$$\nf \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{cg} + (\\mathbf{u}_{cg} \\cdot \\nabla_h) \\mathbf{u}_{cg} = -g \\nabla \\eta\n$$\nThe term $(\\mathbf{u}_{cg} \\cdot \\nabla_h)\\mathbf{u}_{cg}$ represents the centrifugal force for a curved flow path. As the current speed increases at lower latitudes, this centrifugal term becomes increasingly important. Therefore, while geostrophic balance might be an excellent approximation at mid-latitudes like $45^{\\circ}$, it becomes progressively worse closer to the equator. At $10^{\\circ}$, the flow is better described by cyclogeostrophic balance, where the pressure gradient force is balanced by both the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force. The large computed change in $|\\mathbf{u}_g|$ signals a fundamental shift in the dominant dynamics, away from simple geostrophy toward a more complex, non-linear balance. Near the equator, where $f \\to 0$, geostrophic balance is undefined, and non-linear dynamics dominate.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Thermal Wind Relation\n\nThe horizontal momentum equations for a steady, inviscid flow in a rotating frame, under the Boussinesq approximation, represent geostrophic balance. The geostrophic velocity components $(u_g, v_g)$ are related to the pressure field $p$ by:\n$$\n-f v_g = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nf u_g = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}\n$$\nwhere $f$ is the Coriolis parameter and $\\rho_0$ is the constant reference density.\n\nThe vertical momentum equation reduces to hydrostatic balance:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the in situ density and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nTo find the vertical shear of the geostrophic velocity, we differentiate the geostrophic balance equations with respect to the vertical coordinate $z$:\n$$\n-f \\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf \\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming the pressure field is sufficiently smooth, we can interchange the order of differentiation (Clairaut's theorem):\n$$\n-f \\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf \\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute the hydrostatic balance relation $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g$ into these equations:\n$$\n-f \\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(-\\rho g) = \\frac{g}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nf \\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(-\\rho g) = \\frac{g}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}\n$$\nSolving for the shear components gives the thermal wind equations:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z} = \\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f} \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}\n$$\nIn vector form, the vertical shear of the geostrophic velocity $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z}, \\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z}\\right)$ is related to the horizontal density gradient $\\nabla_h \\rho = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}\\right)$ by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_g}{\\partial z} = \\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f} \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} \\times \\nabla_h \\rho\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the unit vector in the vertical direction. This is the required relation.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Uncertainty Expression\n\nWe estimate the horizontal density gradients using the provided central difference formulas. Let the estimated quantities be denoted with a hat.\n$$\n\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}} = \\frac{\\rho_E - \\rho_W}{2\\Delta x}, \\qquad \\widehat{\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}} = \\frac{\\rho_N - \\rho_S}{2\\Delta y}\n$$\nThe measurements $\\rho_i$ ($i \\in \\{E, W, N, S\\}$) have independent random errors $\\epsilon_i$ with mean $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_i) = 0$ and variance $\\mathbb{E}(\\epsilon_i^2) = \\sigma_\\rho^2$. The error in the estimate of the $x$-gradient is $\\delta(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}}) = \\frac{\\epsilon_E - \\epsilon_W}{2\\Delta x}$. The variance of this error is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\left(\\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}}\\right)\\right) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_E - \\epsilon_W}{2\\Delta x}\\right)^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{(2\\Delta x)^2} \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_E^2 - 2\\epsilon_E\\epsilon_W + \\epsilon_W^2]\n$$\nSince the errors are independent, $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_E\\epsilon_W] = \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_E]\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_W] = 0$. Thus,\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{\\partial\\rho/\\partial x} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_E^2] + \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon_W^2]}{(2\\Delta x)^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\rho^2 + \\sigma_\\rho^2}{4(\\Delta x)^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\rho^2}{2(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nSimilarly, the variance of the error in the $y$-gradient estimate is:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{\\partial\\rho/\\partial y} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\rho^2}{2(\\Delta y)^2}\n$$\nUsing the thermal wind relations, the estimated geostrophic shear components are:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z}} = \\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f} \\widehat{\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}}, \\qquad \\widehat{\\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z}} = -\\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f} \\widehat{\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}}\n$$\nThe errors in these estimates are $\\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z}}\\right) = \\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f} \\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial y}}\\right)$ and $\\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z}}\\right) = -\\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f} \\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial x}}\\right)$. The variances of the shear component errors are:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{\\partial u_g/\\partial z} = \\text{Var}\\left(\\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z}}\\right)\\right) = \\left(\\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2_{\\partial\\rho/\\partial y} = \\left(\\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\sigma_\\rho^2}{2(\\Delta y)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{\\partial v_g/\\partial z} = \\text{Var}\\left(\\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z}}\\right)\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2_{\\partial\\rho/\\partial x} = \\left(\\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\sigma_\\rho^2}{2(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nWe need to find the root-mean-square magnitude of the uncertainty in the shear vector, which is $\\left[ \\mathbb{E}\\left( \\left| \\delta\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{g}}{\\partial z}\\right)\\right|^{2} \\right) \\right]^{1/2}$. The squared magnitude of the error vector is:\n$$\n\\left| \\delta\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{g}}{\\partial z}\\right)\\right|^{2} = \\left(\\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z}}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z}}\\right)\\right)^2\n$$\nTaking the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left| \\delta\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{g}}{\\partial z}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial z}}\\right)\\right)^2\\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\delta\\left(\\widehat{\\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial z}}\\right)\\right)^2\\right] = \\sigma^2_{\\partial u_g/\\partial z} + \\sigma^2_{\\partial v_g/\\partial z}\n$$\nThe errors in the two gradient components are uncorrelated because all density measurement errors $\\epsilon_i$ are independent. Substituting the variances:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left| \\delta\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{g}}{\\partial z}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right] = \\left(\\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\sigma_\\rho^2}{2(\\Delta y)^2} + \\left(\\frac{g}{\\rho_0 f}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\sigma_\\rho^2}{2(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left| \\delta\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{g}}{\\partial z}\\right)\\right|^{2}\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{g \\sigma_\\rho}{\\rho_0 f}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta y)^2}\\right)\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the desired expression for the RMS uncertainty magnitude:\n$$\n\\left[ \\mathbb{E}\\left( \\left| \\delta\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{g}}{\\partial z}\\right)\\right|^{2} \\right) \\right]^{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{g \\sigma_\\rho}{\\rho_0 f}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta y)^2}\\right)} = \\frac{g \\sigma_\\rho}{\\sqrt{2} |\\rho_0 f|} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(\\Delta x)^2} + \\frac{1}{(\\Delta y)^2}}\n$$\nSince all provided constants are positive, we can drop the absolute value on $f$.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n$f = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\rho_{0} = 1025\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$\\sigma_{\\rho} = 1.0\\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$\\Delta x = 2.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\Delta y = 3.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nLet $U$ be the uncertainty we want to calculate.\n$$\nU = \\frac{9.81 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-2})}{\\sqrt{2} \\times 1025 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{(2.0 \\times 10^{4})^2} + \\frac{1}{(3.0 \\times 10^{4})^2}}\n$$\n$$\nU = \\frac{0.0981}{\\sqrt{2} \\times 0.1025} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4.0 \\times 10^8} + \\frac{1}{9.0 \\times 10^8}}\n$$\n$$\nU = \\frac{0.0981}{0.144956...} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10^8}\\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{9}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nU \\approx 0.67675 \\times \\frac{1}{10^4} \\sqrt{\\frac{9+4}{36}}\n$$\n$$\nU \\approx 0.67675 \\times 10^{-4} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{13}{36}} = 0.67675 \\times 10^{-4} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{6}\n$$\n$$\nU \\approx 0.67675 \\times 10^{-4} \\times \\frac{3.60555}{6} \\approx 0.67675 \\times 10^{-4} \\times 0.600925\n$$\n$$\nU \\approx 4.0667 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $4.067 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.",
