## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The principles governing isoneutral and [diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1123661), detailed in the preceding chapters, are far more than theoretical abstractions. They form the bedrock of our quantitative understanding of ocean circulation and its role in the Earth system. In practice, these formulations are indispensable tools used to construct numerical models, interpret large-scale oceanographic observations, and probe the intricate connections between [ocean physics](@entry_id:183539), climate, and [biogeochemistry](@entry_id:152189). This chapter explores these applications, demonstrating how the concepts of isoneutral stirring and [diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1123661) are operationalized in diverse scientific contexts, from the parameterization of sub-grid-scale eddies to the grand challenge of modeling the global climate.

### Eddy Parameterization in Ocean General Circulation Models

Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs) that are used for climate simulation often have horizontal grid resolutions too coarse to explicitly resolve the most energetic [mesoscale eddies](@entry_id:1127814), which typically have scales of tens to hundreds of kilometers. The collective effect of these unresolved eddies on the large-scale flow must therefore be parameterized. The Redi and Gent-McWilliams (GM) schemes are the cornerstones of this effort, providing a physically-grounded representation of how eddies transport heat, salt, and other tracers.

The fundamental insight is that [eddy-induced transport](@entry_id:1124134) can be decomposed into two distinct components. The first is a diffusive component that mixes tracers along neutral surfaces. This is parameterized by the Redi isoneutral diffusion scheme. Mathematically, it is represented by a symmetric, positive-definite diffusion tensor, $\mathbf{K}_R$, that is constructed to act almost exclusively along neutral surfaces. This contrasts sharply with simpler, computationally cheaper [closures](@entry_id:747387) like Laplacian horizontal diffusion, which acts along geopotential surfaces (constant depth), or biharmonic smoothing, which is a scale-selective numerical filter. When isopycnals are tilted relative to the horizontal, as they are in most of the ocean, Laplacian diffusion induces a strong spurious diapycnal flux that unrealistically erodes water mass structure. The Redi scheme, by aligning the diffusion with the physically preferred neutral pathways, largely avoids this artifact. 

The second component of eddy transport is an advective effect that systematically flattens the sloping isopycnal surfaces, thereby releasing [available potential energy](@entry_id:1121282). This process, known as eddy "slumping," is parameterized by the Gent-McWilliams (GM) scheme. Unlike Redi diffusion, the GM parameterization is mathematically represented by a skew-[symmetric operator](@entry_id:275833). This operator can be expressed as an additional advective flux carried by a non-divergent "bolus" velocity, $\mathbf{U}^*$. A key property of a skew-[symmetric operator](@entry_id:275833) is that it does not dissipate tracer variance; it merely redistributes the tracer in space. This makes the GM scheme a representation of adiabatic stirring, not irreversible mixing. When used together, the Redi and GM schemes provide a complete leading-order picture of mesoscale eddy effects: GM adiabatically rearranges tracer fields to flatten isopycnal slopes, while Redi diffusively mixes tracers along these same surfaces. It is important to note that neither scheme directly alters the momentum equations in their standard formulation. Instead, they modify the density field, which in turn affects the pressure field through hydrostatic balance, thereby indirectly influencing the resolved circulation.  

### The Global Buoyancy Budget and Abyssal Stratification

The distinction between adiabatic stirring (GM) and irreversible mixing (diapycnal diffusion) is not merely a mathematical subtlety; it is central to the ocean's role in the global climate system. The ocean absorbs heat at low latitudes and loses it at high latitudes. In a statistically steady state, this surface buoyancy flux must be balanced by an opposing transport of buoyancy in the ocean interior. This requires a net diapycnal transformation of water masses—for instance, the gradual warming of cold, dense water that has sunk at high latitudes as it slowly upwells and returns to the surface.

The GM parameterization, being an [adiabatic process](@entry_id:138150), transports buoyancy entirely along neutral surfaces. It cannot, by definition, provide the cross-isopycnal flux needed to balance the surface forcing. That critical role must be fulfilled by true [diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1123661), a process represented by the symmetric, dissipative part of the sub-grid-scale closure. Mathematically, the GM buoyancy flux is orthogonal to the buoyancy gradient, resulting in zero contribution to the diapycnal buoyancy budget, whereas the symmetric diffusive component produces a downgradient flux across isoneutrals that constitutes irreversible mixing. 

A classic illustration of this global balance is the "abyssal recipes" framework. By simplifying the deep ocean to a one-dimensional, steady-state balance between mean upward advection (upwelling) and downward diapycnal diffusion, one can estimate the magnitude of the diapycnal diffusivity, $K_d$, required to maintain the observed abyssal stratification. Using observationally-constrained estimates for global abyssal upwelling ($w$) and the characteristic vertical scale of the stratification ($H_s$), this framework suggests an average diapycnal diffusivity on the order of $K_d \approx w H_s \approx 10^{-4} \ \mathrm{m^2\,s^{-1}}$. This value, required to close the global [heat budget](@entry_id:195090), is famously about an order of magnitude larger than typical diffusivities measured by microstructure profilers in the quiescent ocean interior ($K_{\mathrm{micro}} \approx 10^{-5} \ \mathrm{m^2\,s^{-1}}$), a long-standing conundrum known as the "missing mixing" problem. 

### Sources and Parameterization of Diapycnal Mixing

The "missing mixing" problem highlights the critical need to understand and parameterize the physical processes responsible for [diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1123661). It is now understood that diapycnal mixing is not uniform but is highly elevated in specific "hotspots," such as near rough bathymetry, over seamounts, and in boundary currents.

A primary driver of interior [diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1123661) is the breaking of [internal gravity waves](@entry_id:185206). As these waves propagate through the stratified ocean, they can become unstable and break, generating turbulence that dissipates energy ($\varepsilon$) and mixes the water. This physical link is encapsulated in parameterizations such as the Osborn relation, which states that the diapycnal diffusivity is proportional to the dissipation rate and inversely proportional to the stratification: $\kappa_{\mathrm{dia}} \propto \varepsilon / N^2$. More sophisticated models for $\kappa_{\mathrm{dia}}$ build upon this by relating the [dissipation rate](@entry_id:748577) itself to the background environmental conditions, such as the [vertical shear](@entry_id:1133795) of the mean flow, $S(z)$, and the [buoyancy frequency](@entry_id:1121933), $N(z)$. For example, a physically-consistent functional form derived from such principles is $\kappa_{\mathrm{dia}}(z) \propto S^2(z)/N(z)$, which captures the dependence of turbulence generation on shear and its suppression by strong stratification. These parameterizations allow ocean models to compute a spatially variable diapycnal diffusivity based on the resolved flow and stratification, a significant improvement over using a constant value. 

Another set of processes that contribute to mixing are double-diffusive phenomena, which occur in regions where both temperature and salinity contribute to the stratification. When warm, salty water overlies cold, fresh water, a process known as "[salt fingering](@entry_id:153510)" can occur, leading to efficient vertical transport of salt and heat. In the opposite case (cold, fresh water over warm, salty water), "diffusive convection" can develop. These processes introduce a vertical mixing component, $\kappa_v$, that is distinct from internal wave-driven turbulence. In the context of isoneutral formulations, this purely vertical mixing does not remain solely diapycnal. Because neutral surfaces are generally tilted with respect to the vertical, the vertical mixing projects onto both the dianeutral and isoneutral directions. This means that double-diffusive processes can act as a source of enhanced *along-neutral* mixing, $\Delta \kappa_{\parallel}$, with a magnitude proportional to $\kappa_v$ and the square of the neutral slope. 

### Numerical Implementation and Computational Oceanography

The implementation of physically-based mixing schemes within numerical models is a profound challenge at the intersection of physical oceanography, [applied mathematics](@entry_id:170283), and computer science. The choice of vertical coordinate system is particularly consequential.

Geopotential ($z$-level) coordinates, with their horizontal levels, are simple to implement but represent the bottom topography as a series of "stair steps." Terrain-following ($\sigma$-level) coordinates, which follow the bathymetry, offer a smoother representation of the bottom but introduce significant complications. Over steep topography, the horizontal pressure gradient in $\sigma$-coordinates must be computed as a small difference between two large, opposing terms. Small [numerical discretization](@entry_id:752782) errors can lead to a large error in this calculation, known as the [pressure gradient error](@entry_id:1130147) (PGE), which can drive spurious currents. Furthermore, if a simple horizontal diffusion operator is used on the steep $\sigma$-surfaces, it can produce catastrophic levels of [spurious diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1132228), as the coordinate surfaces are strongly misaligned with the nearly horizontal isopycnal surfaces. Numerical experiments clearly show that this spurious diffusivity depends strongly on the bathymetric slope, isopycnal slope, and grid resolution, and can easily exceed physical diapycnal mixing by several orders of magnitude.  

Isopycnal (or neutral) coordinate models, where the vertical layers themselves follow density surfaces, are physically ideal for the ocean interior as they naturally separate adiabatic and diabatic motions and eliminate spurious mixing from horizontal diffusion. However, they face challenges in handling the mixed layer, where isopycnals can outcrop at the surface, and in representing diabatic processes.

Modern ocean models have developed sophisticated solutions to these challenges. State-of-the-art implementations of isoneutral diffusion in terrain-following models now compute neutral slopes in geopotential space to avoid metric term contamination, use advanced pressure gradient schemes to minimize PGE, and apply slope-limiting algorithms for [numerical stability](@entry_id:146550).  A popular and successful approach in many climate models is the use of [hybrid coordinates](@entry_id:1126228). These models employ $z$-levels or other convenient coordinates near the surface, where boundary fluxes and diabatic processes are dominant, and transition to isopycnal-following layers in the deep, quiescent interior, where adiabatic dynamics prevail. This design leverages the strengths of each coordinate system in the region where it is most appropriate.  Finally, robust implementations must also recognize the limits of the physical assumptions. In regions of [static instability](@entry_id:1132314) ($N^2  0$), where convection occurs, the concept of a neutral surface is ill-defined and the GM/Redi schemes can become energetically inconsistent, creating potential energy. A robust model must therefore include logic to deactivate these parameterizations in convective regions and rely on a separate [convection scheme](@entry_id:747849). 

### Interdisciplinary Connections: Biogeochemistry and Thermodynamics

The accuracy of physical transport formulations has profound implications for other components of the Earth system, particularly marine [biogeochemistry](@entry_id:152189). The distribution of nutrients, dissolved carbon, oxygen, and other biogeochemical tracers is governed by the same advection-diffusion-reaction equation that describes heat and salt. The physical transport terms—advection by the resolved flow ($\mathbf{u}C$) and mixing by sub-grid processes ($\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{K} \nabla C)$)—directly control the supply of nutrients to the sunlit surface layer, the export of organic matter to the deep ocean, and the ventilation of subsurface oxygen minimum zones. Consequently, any spurious numerical mixing introduced by the physical model will directly translate into an unrealistic and artificial flux of biogeochemical tracers, potentially corrupting simulations of [primary productivity](@entry_id:151277) and the carbon cycle. 

The connection between mixing and thermodynamics also extends to the very definition of the tracers being mixed. The traditional use of potential temperature ($\theta$) and Practical Salinity ($SP$) to define density has known inaccuracies. The Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) introduced more accurate [thermodynamic variables](@entry_id:160587), notably Conservative Temperature ($\Theta$) and Absolute Salinity ($S_A$), which better represent the heat content and total salt content of seawater, respectively. Because these variables are more conservative and provide a more accurate calculation of in-situ density and its derivatives (the [thermal expansion](@entry_id:137427) and haline contraction coefficients), neutral surfaces defined using $\Theta$ and $S_A$ are a more faithful representation of the true neutral [tangent plane](@entry_id:136914). As a result, implementing [isoneutral mixing](@entry_id:1126771) schemes using these modern variables reduces the misalignment between the parameterized mixing surface and the true neutral surface, thereby decreasing the level of spurious diapycnal mixing inherent in the formulation. This demonstrates a virtuous cycle where improved physical understanding of thermodynamics leads directly to more accurate numerical modeling of transport. 

In conclusion, the formulation and implementation of isoneutral and diapycnal mixing schemes are a critical nexus of oceanography. They connect the theoretical physics of turbulent mixing to the practicalities of numerical computation, link the small scales of eddies to the large-scale climate system, and provide the physical transport framework upon which our understanding of marine biogeochemistry is built. Continued refinement of these schemes remains a key frontier in the quest for more faithful and predictive models of the Earth system.
