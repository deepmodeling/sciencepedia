## Introduction
In the stably stratified ocean, the transport of properties like heat and salt is profoundly anisotropic, occurring far more easily along surfaces of constant density than across them. Accurately capturing this behavior is a central challenge in computational oceanography, as simplified models that treat mixing isotropically fail to reproduce the ocean's observed structure and long-term circulation. Addressing this knowledge gap requires a rigorous framework that distinguishes between vigorous mixing along neutral pathways and the energetically costly mixing that crosses them.

This article provides a comprehensive overview of the formulations used to model these distinct mixing processes. The journey begins in the "Principles and Mechanisms" chapter, where we will define the crucial difference between isopycnal and isoneutral surfaces, explore the energetic constraints on mixing, and derive the mathematical form of the [anisotropic diffusion](@entry_id:151085) tensor. Subsequently, the "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" chapter will demonstrate how these theoretical concepts are operationalized in [ocean general circulation models](@entry_id:1129060) to parameterize eddies and influence global climate and [biogeochemical cycles](@entry_id:147568). Finally, the "Hands-On Practices" section will offer concrete problems to solidify the understanding of tensor construction and the implications of these advanced mixing schemes.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the vast, stratified expanse of the ocean, the transport and mixing of heat, salt, and other tracers are not isotropic. The presence of a stable density stratification profoundly influences turbulent motions, leading to mixing processes that are orders of magnitude stronger along surfaces of constant density than across them. To accurately represent these processes in computational models, we must first develop a rigorous understanding of the surfaces that guide this mixing and the physical mechanisms that govern the rates of diffusion. This chapter elucidates these core principles, moving from the fundamental definitions of mixing surfaces to the formulation of diffusion tensors and the subtle complexities arising from the thermodynamic properties of seawater.

### Defining the Mixing Surfaces: Isopycnals and Isoneutrals

The starting point for any discussion of oceanic stratification is density. The **in situ density**, denoted $\rho(S, T, p)$, is the true mass per unit volume of a seawater parcel at its local salinity $S$, in situ temperature $T$, and pressure $p$. It is determined by the nonlinear thermodynamic [equation of state for seawater](@entry_id:1124595). A significant challenge in physical oceanography is that in situ density is heavily influenced by the ambient pressure, which increases hydrostatically with depth. A parcel of water at the surface and one in the deep abyss may have vastly different in situ densities primarily due to compression, even if their intrinsic properties are similar.

To compare the intrinsic density of water parcels from different depths, we must remove this dominant effect of pressure. This is achieved through the concept of **potential density**. A parcel with properties $(S, T, p)$ is conceptually moved adiabatically (conserving its potential temperature, $\theta$) and isohalinity (conserving $S$) to a common reference pressure, $p_0$. The **[potential density](@entry_id:1129991)**, $\rho_\theta$, is the density the parcel would have at this reference pressure, i.e., $\rho_\theta = \rho(S, \theta, p_0)$. For convenience, oceanographers often use the **[potential density](@entry_id:1129991) anomaly**, $\sigma_\theta = \rho(S, \theta, p_0) - 1000 \, \mathrm{kg\,m^{-3}}$. A surface of constant [potential density](@entry_id:1129991) is known as an **isopycnal surface**. For many years, it was assumed that isopycnal surfaces were the primary pathways for enhanced oceanic mixing. However, a more rigorous analysis reveals that this is only an approximation. 

The dynamically most relevant surface for mixing is one along which a fluid parcel can be moved without experiencing any restoring buoyancy force. Such a displacement is called a **neutral displacement**. Consider a parcel moved infinitesimally, adiabatically, and isohalinity. At its new location, it adjusts instantly to the ambient pressure. If its density at this new pressure exactly matches the density of the surrounding fluid, the displacement is neutral. The set of all such possible [infinitesimal displacement](@entry_id:202209) vectors at a point defines the local **neutral [tangent plane](@entry_id:136914)**. An **isoneutral surface** is the conceptual surface that is everywhere tangent to this plane. 

A critical distinction arises: why are isopycnal surfaces (constant $\rho_\theta$) not perfectly neutral? The answer lies in the nonlinearities of the equation of state, specifically the pressure dependence of the [thermal expansion coefficient](@entry_id:150685) ($\alpha$) and the haline contraction coefficient ($\beta$). This effect is known as **thermobaricity**. When a parcel is moved along an isopycnal surface (constant $\rho(S, \theta, p_0)$), its in situ pressure $p$ changes. Because the expansion coefficients depend on this local pressure, the condition for [neutral buoyancy](@entry_id:271501)—a balance of density changes due to temperature and salinity gradients evaluated at the *local pressure*—is not perfectly met. The normal to an isopycnal surface is determined by derivatives of density evaluated at the fixed reference pressure $p_0$, while the normal to the local neutral plane is determined by derivatives evaluated at the local in situ pressure $p$. As these derivatives differ, the surfaces diverge. 

We can quantify this divergence. For an [infinitesimal displacement](@entry_id:202209) in an $(x,z)$ plane, the slope of a surface of constant in-situ density, $z'_\rho$, is given by the condition $d\rho=0$:
$$ z'_{\rho} = - \frac{\rho_T T_x + \rho_S S_x + \rho_p p_x}{\rho_T T_z + \rho_S S_z + \rho_p p_z} $$
where subscripts denote partial derivatives (e.g., $T_x = \partial T / \partial x$) and $\rho_p = (\partial\rho/\partial p)_{T,S}$ represents the compressibility. In contrast, the slope of a neutral surface, $z'_n$, is derived from the condition that a displaced parcel's density matches its new environment, which to first order yields:
$$ z'_{n} = - \frac{\rho_T T_x + \rho_S S_x}{\rho_T T_z + \rho_S S_z} $$
The pressure gradient terms cancel in the neutral case because the parcel and environment are compared at the same final pressure. The difference in slopes, $\Delta z' = z'_{\rho} - z'_{n}$, is non-zero and directly proportional to the compressibility term $\rho_p$ and the pressure gradients. This demonstrates that surfaces of constant in-situ density are not neutral, and by extension, neither are surfaces of constant potential density referenced to a fixed pressure. 

### The Energetic Basis for Anisotropic Mixing

The distinction between isoneutral and across-neutral (diapycnal) directions is of paramount importance because the energetic cost of mixing is vastly different in these two directions. In a stably [stratified fluid](@entry_id:201059), **[diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1123661)** involves moving denser water up and lighter water down. This process works against the gravitational force and irreversibly increases the background potential energy (BPE) of the fluid column. This requires a continuous supply of energy.

This energetic constraint can be quantified. The rate of TKE dissipation per unit mass is denoted by $\varepsilon$. A fraction of this energy, determined by the mixing efficiency $\Gamma$ (typically around $0.2$), is used to increase the BPE. The rate of BPE increase is equivalent to the [buoyancy flux](@entry_id:261821), $J_b$. Thus, we have $J_b = \Gamma \varepsilon$. The [buoyancy flux](@entry_id:261821) can also be expressed through a down-gradient Fickian diffusion model: $J_b = K_d (d\bar{b}/dz)$, where $K_d$ is the diapycnal diffusivity and $d\bar{b}/dz$ is the vertical gradient of mean buoyancy. This gradient is, by definition, the squared buoyancy frequency, $N^2$. Equating the two expressions for buoyancy flux gives the seminal Osborn (1980) relation:
$$ K_d N^2 = \Gamma \varepsilon \quad \implies \quad K_d = \frac{\Gamma \varepsilon}{N^2} $$
This fundamental relationship reveals that for a given [energy dissipation](@entry_id:147406) rate $\varepsilon$, the diapycnal diffusivity $K_d$ is inversely proportional to the strength of the stratification $N^2$. Strong stratification heavily suppresses diapycnal mixing. 

In stark contrast, **[isoneutral mixing](@entry_id:1126771)**, which occurs along neutral surfaces, involves no net vertical displacement of mass against gravity. By definition, it does not change the BPE of the fluid. Consequently, it is not subject to the same stringent energetic constraint. While the structure of the turbulence that drives [isoneutral mixing](@entry_id:1126771) is influenced by stratification, the isoneutral diffusivity, $K_{iso}$, is not directly suppressed by $N^2$ in the same way as $K_d$. This lack of a direct energetic barrier allows [isoneutral mixing](@entry_id:1126771) to be much more vigorous than [diapycnal mixing](@entry_id:1123661). In the ocean interior, typical values are $K_{iso} \sim 10^2 - 10^3 \, \mathrm{m^2\,s^{-1}}$, whereas $K_d \sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{m^2\,s^{-1}}$, a difference of six to eight orders of magnitude. 

### Formulating Isoneutral and Diapycnal Diffusion: The Diffusion Tensor

To represent this highly [anisotropic mixing](@entry_id:1121023) in a mathematical framework, we generalize Fick's law using a symmetric, positive-semidefinite [diffusion tensor](@entry_id:748421), $\mathbf{K}$:
$$ \mathbf{F} = -\mathbf{K} \nabla C $$
where $\mathbf{F}$ is the [diffusive flux](@entry_id:748422) of a tracer with concentration $C$. The tensor $\mathbf{K}$ encodes the directional dependence of the mixing. Its structure is determined by the local orientation of the neutral surface. 

The eigenvectors of $\mathbf{K}$ define the principal axes of diffusion. One eigenvector is aligned with the direction normal to the local neutral surface, $\mathbf{s}$. The corresponding eigenvalue is the small diapycnal diffusivity, $K_d$. The other two eigenvectors span the neutral [tangent plane](@entry_id:136914) (i.e., they are orthogonal to $\mathbf{s}$). Their corresponding eigenvalues are the large isoneutral diffusivity, $K_{iso}$. [@problem_id:3809693, @problem_id:3796389]

To calculate the diffusive flux, we decompose the tracer gradient $\nabla C$ into a component normal to the neutral surface (the diapycnal gradient, $\nabla C_{dia}$) and a component tangent to it (the isoneutral gradient, $\nabla C_{iso}$):
$$ \nabla C = \nabla C_{iso} + \nabla C_{dia} $$
where $\nabla C_{dia} = (\nabla C \cdot \mathbf{s})\mathbf{s}$ and $\nabla C_{iso} = \nabla C - (\nabla C \cdot \mathbf{s})\mathbf{s}$.
By the linearity of the tensor operation, the total flux $\mathbf{F}$ can be separated into its isoneutral and diapycnal components:
$$ \mathbf{F} = \mathbf{F}_{iso} + \mathbf{F}_{dia} = -K_{iso} \nabla C_{iso} - K_d \nabla C_{dia} $$

For example, consider a point where the normal to the neutral surface is $\mathbf{s} = (2/\sqrt{5}, 0, 1/\sqrt{5})^\top$ and the tracer gradient is $\nabla C = (10^{-3}, 2\times 10^{-3}, -10^{-3})^\top \, \mathrm{m^{-1}}$. With typical diffusivities $K_{iso} = 10^3 \, \mathrm{m^2\,s^{-1}}$ and $K_d = 10^{-5} \, \mathrm{m^2\,s^{-1}}$, we first project the gradient. The component of $\nabla C$ along $\mathbf{s}$ is $\nabla C \cdot \mathbf{s} = 10^{-3}/\sqrt{5}$. This gives a diapycnal gradient component of $\nabla C_{dia} \approx (4 \times 10^{-4}, 0, 2 \times 10^{-4})^\top \, \mathrm{m^{-1}}$ and an isoneutral gradient component of $\nabla C_{iso} \approx (6 \times 10^{-4}, 2 \times 10^{-3}, -1.2 \times 10^{-3})^\top \, \mathrm{m^{-1}}$. The resulting fluxes are then $\mathbf{F}_{dia} \approx (-4 \times 10^{-9}, 0, -2 \times 10^{-9})^\top \, \mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{iso} = (-0.6, -2.0, 1.2)^\top \, \mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$. This calculation vividly illustrates the vast difference in magnitude between the two flux components. 

### Implementation in Ocean Models: The Redi Tensor

The conceptual framework of a rotated [diffusion tensor](@entry_id:748421) must be translated into a concrete mathematical form for use in [ocean general circulation models](@entry_id:1129060) (OGCMs), which are often formulated in geopotential ($z$) coordinates. This leads to the **Redi isoneutral [diffusion tensor](@entry_id:748421)**, proposed by Redi (1982).

The components of the Redi tensor $\mathbf{K}$ in $z$-coordinates can be derived from the fundamental physical constraint that, in the absence of explicit diapycnal mixing ($K_d=0$), the [diffusive flux](@entry_id:748422) $\mathbf{F}$ must be purely isoneutral. This means the [flux vector](@entry_id:273577) must be orthogonal to the vector normal to the neutral surface, $\mathbf{n}$. In a z-coordinate system, the local unnormalized [normal vector](@entry_id:264185) can be written in terms of the neutral surface slopes, $s_x$ and $s_y$, as $\mathbf{n} = (-s_x, -s_y, 1)$. The condition $\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{F} = 0$ for any tracer gradient $\nabla C$ imposes specific constraints on the components of $\mathbf{K}$.

Assuming horizontal [isotropy](@entry_id:159159) of the mixing process ($K_{xx}=K_{yy}=K_{iso}$, $K_{xy}=0$), this constraint dictates the form of the off-diagonal and vertical components of the tensor. The resulting [symmetric tensor](@entry_id:144567) that includes both isoneutral and diapycnal mixing (approximated as purely vertical diffusion) is:
$$ \mathbf{K} = \begin{pmatrix} K_{iso} & 0 & K_{iso}s_x \\ 0 & K_{iso} & K_{iso}s_y \\ K_{iso}s_x & K_{iso}s_y & K_d + K_{iso}(s_x^2+s_y^2) \end{pmatrix} $$
The geometric meaning of these components is crucial. The diagonal terms $K_{xx}$ and $K_{yy}$ represent the strong horizontal component of the mixing. The **off-diagonal cross-terms**, such as $K_{xz} = K_{iso}s_x$, are the key to rotating the diffusion. They generate a vertical flux component from a horizontal tracer gradient (e.g., $F_z \propto -K_{iso}s_x (\partial C/\partial x)$). Symmetrically, the term $K_{zz} = K_d + K_{iso}s^2$ includes a component $K_{iso}s^2$ that generates a vertical flux from a vertical gradient, which precisely balances the other terms to ensure the total isoneutral flux remains confined to the tilted neutral plane. The $K_d$ term represents the weak, physically distinct diapycnal mixing. 

A more formal way to derive this tensor, independent of the coordinate system, is to use a [projection operator](@entry_id:143175). The operator that projects any vector onto the local neutral [tangent plane](@entry_id:136914) is $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{s}\mathbf{s}^\top$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor and $\mathbf{s}$ is the [unit normal vector](@entry_id:178851). The purely isoneutral part of the diffusion tensor is then simply $\mathbf{K}_{iso} = K_{iso}\mathbf{P}$. The diapycnal part is $\mathbf{K}_{dia} = K_d \mathbf{s}\mathbf{s}^\top$. The total [diffusion tensor](@entry_id:748421) is the sum $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{K}_{iso} + \mathbf{K}_{dia}$. Expanding the components of this tensor in z-coordinates, using the slopes to define $\mathbf{s}$, recovers the Redi tensor form. 

### A Deeper Dive: The Problem of Integrability and Neutral Helicity

A profound complication lies hidden within the concept of an "isoneutral surface." While we can define a unique neutral [tangent plane](@entry_id:136914) at every point, does this field of planes integrate to form a set of smooth, non-intersecting global surfaces? The answer, due to the specific thermodynamic properties of seawater, is no.

The neutrality condition can be expressed as a Pfaffian [differential form](@entry_id:174025), $\omega = \beta\,dS - \alpha\,d\theta = 0$. For a globally-defined scalar neutral density $\gamma_n$ to exist, whose [level sets](@entry_id:151155) ($d\gamma_n=0$) are the neutral surfaces, the form $\omega$ must be integrable. The **Frobenius [integrability](@entry_id:142415) theorem** states that this is true if and only if $\omega \wedge d\omega = 0$. For seawater, the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ depend on pressure. This pressure dependence, particularly **[thermobaricity](@entry_id:1133045)** (the change in thermal expansion with pressure, $\partial\alpha/\partial p$), causes the Frobenius condition to fail. In general, $\omega \wedge d\omega \neq 0$. 

The physical manifestation of this non-integrability is captured by the **neutral helicity**, $H = \mathbf{N} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{N})$, where $\mathbf{N} = \alpha\nabla T - \beta\nabla S$ is the vector normal to the neutral plane. A detailed derivation shows that the helicity is non-zero and depends directly on the pressure dependence of the expansion coefficients:
$$ H = \left(\beta\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial p} - \alpha\frac{\partial\beta}{\partial p}\right) \nabla p \cdot (\nabla S \times \nabla T) $$
A non-zero helicity implies that the neutral vector field is "twisted." If one were to trace a path that remains within the neutral plane while circumnavigating a closed loop in the horizontal, the path would not close in the vertical. Instead, it would spiral up or down, forming a **neutral helix**. 

This has a critical physical consequence: [isoneutral mixing](@entry_id:1126771) itself can induce diapycnal transformation. As eddies stir fluid parcels along these helical neutral pathways, the net vertical displacement and associated pressure change cause a change in the parcels' in-situ density. This effect, sometimes called thermobaric [cabbeling](@entry_id:1121979), represents a diapycnal flux of density that arises directly from the [isoneutral mixing](@entry_id:1126771) process in a non-integrable world. The magnitude of this induced diapycnal flux is proportional to the strength of the [isoneutral mixing](@entry_id:1126771) ($K_{iso}$) and the magnitude of the neutral helicity ($H$). 

### Practical Solutions: The Neutral Density $\gamma^n$

The non-existence of exact global neutral surfaces presents a practical challenge for ocean modeling. How can we define surfaces for mixing if they are not mathematically well-behaved? Two approaches are common. The first is to use the Redi tensor, which operates on local slopes and does not require a global surface definition.

The second approach is to construct an approximate neutral density scalar, denoted **$\gamma^n$**. This widely-used variable is not an exact solution but rather a sophisticated practical compromise. The construction of $\gamma^n$ begins with a high-quality global reference hydrographic dataset (e.g., from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment, WOCE, or modern Argo data). An algorithm is then used to create a scalar field, $\gamma^n(S, T, p)$, whose gradient, $\nabla\gamma^n$, is a best-fit, in a [least-squares](@entry_id:173916) sense, to the true local neutral vector field over the entire reference dataset. In essence, the algorithm minimizes the angle between the gradient of the approximate surface and the true neutral direction. 

It is crucial to recognize the properties and limitations of $\gamma^n$:
1.  **It is an approximation:** The level sets of $\gamma^n$ are not perfectly neutral. Using them to guide diffusion will inevitably introduce small, spurious diapycnal fluxes because the underlying neutral vector field is not truly integrable. The construction algorithm is designed to minimize these errors. 
2.  **It is dependent on external data:** The specific functional form of $\gamma^n$ depends on the chosen **equation of state** (which determines the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$) and the **reference hydrographic dataset** used in the fitting process. A different dataset or a new equation of state would lead to a different $\gamma^n$ field. 
3.  **It is not potential density:** The $\gamma^n$ surfaces are distinct from, and generally more accurate than, potential density surfaces for representing neutral pathways, especially over large depth ranges. 

In summary, the parameterization of mixing in the ocean's interior requires a deep appreciation for the underlying thermodynamics of seawater. The concepts of isoneutral and diapycnal mixing, rooted in energetic constraints, are formalized through the Redi diffusion tensor. The very definition of these surfaces, however, is complicated by the non-integrability of neutral planes, a consequence of [thermobaricity](@entry_id:1133045). This theoretical challenge has led to practical solutions like the rotated tensor formalism and the development of approximate neutral density variables such as $\gamma^n$, which remain cornerstones of modern computational oceanography.
