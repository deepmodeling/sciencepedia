            "problem": "A coastal ocean model applies a momentum-conserving bottom boundary condition in which the bed exerts a shear stress on the flow through turbulent momentum exchange. Consider a neutrally stratified, steady, horizontally homogeneous bottom boundary layer over a planar bed, where the measured mean current speed at a reference height $z_r$ above the bed is $U_r$. In Reynolds-averaged descriptions of turbulence, the bed shear stress magnitude $|\\tau_b|$ is defined as the near-bed turbulent momentum flux and is commonly summarized by the friction velocity $u_*$ via $|\\tau_b|=\\rho\\,u_*^2$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of geophysical fluid dynamics, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem provides two expressions for the magnitude of the bed shear stress, $|\\tau_b|$. The first is a definition in terms of the friction velocity, $u_*$, and the fluid density, $\\rho$:\n$$\n|\\tau_b| = \\rho u_*^2\n$$\nThe second is a quadratic drag law parameterization, which expresses the stress in terms of the mean current speed at a reference height, $U_r$, a dimensionless drag coefficient, $C_d$, and the fluid density, $\\rho$:\n$$\n|\\tau_b| = \\rho C_d U_r^2\n$$\nThe problem requires deriving expressions for $u_*$ and $|\\tau_b|$ and then computing their numerical values.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the friction velocity, $u_*$. By equating the two expressions for $|\\tau_b|$, we have:\n$$\n\\rho u_*^2 = \\rho C_d U_r^2\n$$\nThe density, $\\rho$, is non-zero and can be cancelled from both sides of the equation:\n$$\nu_*^2 = C_d U_r^2\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides yields the expression for $u_*$. Since $u_*$ represents a velocity scale, it is a non-negative quantity.\n$$\nu_* = \\sqrt{C_d} U_r\n$$\nThe expression for $|\\tau_b|$ is already given by the quadratic drag law:\n$$\n|\\tau_b| = \\rho C_d U_r^2\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values for $u_*$ and $|\\tau_b|$ using the provided data:\n$U_r = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n$\\rho = 1027\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$C_d = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expressions. For the friction velocity, $u_*$:\n$$\nu_* = \\sqrt{2.5 \\times 10^{-3}} \\times 0.45\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} = \\sqrt{0.0025} \\times 0.45\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nu_* = 0.05 \\times 0.45\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} = 0.0225\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $u_* = 0.02250\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nFor the magnitude of the bed shear stress, $|\\tau_b|$:\n$$\n|\\tau_b| = (1027\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (0.45\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})^2\n$$\n$$\n|\\tau_b| = 1027 \\times 0.0025 \\times 0.2025 \\,\\, \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}\n$$\n$$\n|\\tau_b| = 0.51991875\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $|\\tau_b| = 0.5199\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\nFinally, we address the sources of uncertainty in $\\rho$ and $C_d$ and their relative impact on $|\\tau_b|$.\nThe bed shear stress is given by $|\\tau_b| = \\rho C_d U_r^2$. The sensitivity of $|\\tau_b|$ to small perturbations in $\\rho$ and $C_d$ is given by the total differential, which, in relative terms, is $\\frac{\\delta |\\tau_b|}{|\\tau_b|} \\approx \\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho} + \\frac{\\delta C_d}{C_d}$, assuming uncertainties in $U_r$ are not considered.\n\nThe density of seawater, $\\rho$, is a function of temperature ($T$), salinity ($S$), and pressure ($p$), as described by the UNESCO International Equation of State of Seawater. On a continental shelf, the primary sources of uncertainty or variability in $\\rho$ are spatial and temporal changes in temperature and salinity. For example, surface heating/cooling, riverine freshwater input, or the advection of different water masses can alter $T$ and $S$. However, the total range of density variation on a typical shelf is small, e.g., from approximately $1024\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$ to $1028\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$. This corresponds to a relative uncertainty $\\frac{\\delta \\rho}{\\rho}$ of less than $0.5\\%$.\n\nThe drag coefficient, $C_d$, is a far more significant source of uncertainty. It is not a fundamental constant but a parameterization that encapsulates complex near-bed physics. Its value is highly dependent on:\n1.  The physical roughness of the seabed, characterized by the roughness length $z_0$. This is determined by sediment grain size, the presence and geometry of bedforms (such as ripples and dunes), and benthic biology (e.g., biofilms, shells, bioturbation), all of which are highly variable in space and time.\n2.  The reference height $z_r$ at which the velocity is measured. For a logarithmic velocity profile, $C_d = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\ln(z_r/z_0)}\\right)^2$, where $\\kappa \\approx 0.41$ is the von Kármán constant. This shows a strong, non-linear dependency on $z_0$ and $z_r$.\n3.  Other physical processes, such as sediment transport (mobile bed effects) and the interaction of currents with surface waves, which can significantly enhance bottom-generated turbulence and thus increase the effective drag.\n\nGiven these factors, $C_d$ is not a well-constrained parameter. While $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ is a canonical value, it can easily vary by a factor of $2$ to $3$ (i.e., from $1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ to $5 \\times 10^{-3}$ or more) depending on local conditions. This represents a relative uncertainty $\\frac{\\delta C_d}{C_d}$ of $50\\%$ to over $100\\%$.\n\nComparing the relative impacts, the uncertainty in $C_d$ is orders of magnitude larger than the uncertainty in $\\rho$. For the given case, a $50\\%$ uncertainty in $C_d$ would lead to a $50\\%$ uncertainty in $|\\tau_b|$, whereas a $0.5\\%$ uncertainty in $\\rho$ leads to only a $0.5\\%$ uncertainty in $|\\tau_b|$. Therefore, the uncertainty in the drag coefficient $C_d$ is overwhelmingly the dominant source of uncertainty in the calculation of bottom-boundary-layer shear stress in computational oceanography.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of fundamental relationships for a neutrally stratified, steady, horizontally uniform turbulent bottom boundary layer and the subsequent calculation of key parameters. We begin from first principles.\n\nFor a steady ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$), horizontally uniform ($\\partial/\\partial x = \\partial/\\partial y = 0$) flow, the Reynolds-averaged momentum equation in the horizontal direction simplifies. Assuming the only forcing is a pressure gradient balanced by friction (as in a geostrophic flow with an Ekman layer, but we are concerned only with the near-bed layer where rotation is often negligible for the momentum balance), the dominant balance in the near-bed region is between the vertical divergence of the turbulent stress and a pressure gradient/Coriolis term. For a simple channel flow or a boundary layer far from the upper surface, this balance simplifies further. The problem implies a constant-stress layer, a standard assumption near the boundary. In this layer, the vertical flux of momentum, or shear stress $\\tau$, is constant with height $z$ and equal to the bed shear stress, $\\tau_b$.\n$$\n\\tau(z) = \\tau_b = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThe shear stress is composed of viscous and turbulent (Reynolds) stresses. For a hydraulically rough flow, the turbulent stress dominates, so $\\tau \\approx -\\rho \\overline{u'w'}$, where $\\rho$ is the fluid density and $\\overline{u'w'}$ is the time-averaged product of horizontal and vertical velocity fluctuations.\n\nThe Prandtl–von Kármán mixing-length model provides a closure for the Reynolds stress:\n$$\n-\\overline{u'w'} = \\nu_T \\frac{dU}{dz}\n$$\nwhere $\\nu_T$ is the eddy viscosity and $\\frac{dU}{dz}$ is the mean velocity shear. The eddy viscosity is parameterized using a mixing length $l$:\n$$\n\\nu_T = l^2 \\left|\\frac{dU}{dz}\\right|\n$$\nThe problem specifies the mixing length as $l = \\kappa z$, where $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant. The velocity $U$ is expected to increase with $z$, so $\\frac{dU}{dz}  0$. Combining these gives:\n$$\n\\tau = \\rho (\\kappa z)^2 \\left(\\frac{dU}{dz}\\right)^2\n$$\nBy definition, the friction velocity $u_*$ is related to the bed shear stress $\\tau_b$ by:\n$$\nu_* \\equiv \\sqrt{\\frac{\\tau_b}{\\rho}}\n$$\nThis implies the first requested relationship, $\\tau_b = \\rho u_*^2$. Since the stress is constant in the layer, $\\tau(z) = \\tau_b$, we can write:\n$$\nu_*^2 = (\\kappa z)^2 \\left(\\frac{dU}{dz}\\right)^2\n$$\nTaking the positive square root (since $u_*  0$, $\\kappa  0$, $z  0$, and $dU/dz  0$):\n$$\nu_* = \\kappa z \\frac{dU}{dz}\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation for the velocity profile $U(z)$. We rearrange and integrate to find $U(z)$:\n$$\ndU = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa} \\frac{dz}{z}\n$$\nTo solve this, we must establish a boundary condition. For a hydraulically rough surface, the velocity profile extrapolates to zero not at the bed itself ($z=0$), but at a height $z_0$ known as the roughness length.

A step-by-step solution can be computed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution proceeds in four main stages for each test case: (1) fitting the log-law to determine the profile parameters, (2) calculating point estimates of the drag coefficient $C_d$ and bottom stress $\\tau_b$, (3) performing a bootstrap analysis to quantify uncertainty in $\\tau_b$, and (4) reporting the results.\n\n**1. Log-Law Profile Fitting**\nThe relationship $U(z) = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)$ can be rewritten as $U(z) = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa} \\ln(z) - \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa} \\ln(z_0)$. This matches the linear form $U(z) = A \\ln(z) + B$, where the slope is $A = u_*/\\kappa$ and the intercept is $B = - (u_*/\\kappa) \\ln(z_0)$.\nGiven a set of measurement pairs $(z_i, U_i)$, we first transform the heights to $x_i = \\ln(z_i)$. We then perform a linear least-squares regression on the $(x_i, U_i)$ pairs to find the best-fit coefficients $\\hat{A}$ and $\\hat{B}$.\nFrom these coefficients, the hydrodynamic roughness length $\\hat{z}_0$ is estimated. Since $\\hat{B}/\\hat{A} = -\\ln(\\hat{z}_0)$, we have:\n$$ \\hat{z}_0 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hat{B}}{\\hat{A}}\\right) $$\n\n**2. Point Estimates of $C_d$ and $\\tau_b$**\nWith the estimated roughness length $\\hat{z}_0$, the drag coefficient $\\hat{C}_d$ at the specified reference height $z_r$ is calculated. This formula is derived by combining the definition of $C_d$ with the log-law:\n$C_d(z_r) = (u_*/U_r)^2$ and $U_r = (u_*/\\kappa)\\ln(z_r/z_0)$, which gives $u_*/U_r = \\kappa/\\ln(z_r/z_0)$. Therefore:\n$$ \\hat{C}_d(z_r) = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\ln(z_r / \\hat{z}_0)}\\right)^2 $$\nThe point estimate for the bottom shear stress, $\\hat{\\tau}_b$, is then computed using the quadratic drag law with the given density $\\rho$, the measured reference speed $U_r$, and the estimated drag coefficient $\\hat{C}_d(z_r)$:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}_b = \\rho \\, \\hat{C}_d(z_r) \\, U_r^2 $$\n\n**3. Bootstrap Uncertainty Quantification**\nTo assess the uncertainty in $\\tau_b$ arising from the variability in the velocity measurements, we employ a nonparametric bootstrap. This statistical technique involves repeated resampling of the original data to simulate a distribution of possible outcomes. The procedure is as follows:\n- A fixed random seed ($42$) is used to ensure reproducibility.\n- A total of $N=2000$ bootstrap replicates are generated. For each replicate:\n    a. A new dataset of $(z_i, U_i)$ pairs is created by drawing with replacement from the original set of measurements. The size of the new dataset is the same as the original.\n    b. The log-law fitting procedure is repeated on this resampled dataset to obtain a new set of coefficients, $A^*$ and $B^*$.\n    c. The new coefficients are validated. If $A^* \\le 0$, the replicate is discarded as it implies a non-physical zero or negative friction velocity.\n    d. A new roughness length $z_0^* = \\exp(-B^*/A^*)$ is computed.\n    e. The applicability of the log-law at the reference height is checked. If $\\ln(z_r/z_0^*) \\le 0$ (i.e., $z_r \\le z_0^*$), the reference height is below the roughness length, which is non-physical. The replicate is discarded.\n    f. For valid replicates, a bootstrap estimate of the drag coefficient $C_d^*(z_r)$ and bottom stress $\\tau_b^*$ are calculated:\n    $$ C_d^*(z_r) = \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\ln(z_r / z_0^*)}\\right)^2 $$\n    $$ \\tau_b^* = \\rho \\, C_d^*(z_r) \\, U_r^2 $$\n- After generating all replicates, the collection of valid $\\tau_b^*$ values forms the bootstrap distribution of the bottom shear stress.\n\n**4. Confidence Interval and Reporting**\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\tau_b$ is determined from the empirical bootstrap distribution. The lower bound, $\\tau_{b, \\text{low}}$, is the $2.5$-th percentile, and the upper bound, $\\tau_{b, \\text{high}}$, is the $97.5$-th percentile of the sorted $\\tau_b^*$ values.\nFor each test case, the final result is a collection of four values: the point estimate of the shear stress $\\hat{\\tau}_b$, the lower and upper bounds of its confidence interval ($\\tau_{b, \\text{low}}$, $\\tau_{b, \\text{high}}$), and the point estimate of the drag coefficient $\\hat{C}_d(z_r)$. These results are then formatted as specified.",
