The OER is described as a sequence of four proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps. The core principle for solving this problem is understanding how the free energy of an electrochemical reaction step, $\\Delta G$, changes with the applied electrode potential, $U$.\n\nFor a reaction step involving the transfer of one electron from the electrode to a species in solution, the free energy change $\\Delta G$ at a potential $U$ is related to the free energy change at zero potential, $\\Delta G(U=0)$, by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G(U) = \\Delta G(U=0) - eU\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge. In this formulation, $U$ is measured with respect to a reference electrode, which is the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE) in this problem.
