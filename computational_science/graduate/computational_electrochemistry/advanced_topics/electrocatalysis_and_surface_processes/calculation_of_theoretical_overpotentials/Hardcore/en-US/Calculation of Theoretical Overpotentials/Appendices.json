As per the problem's convention, free energies are expressed in electronvolts (eV) and potentials in volts (V). In this system of units, the elementary charge $e$ is numerically equal to $1$, so the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta G_i(U)_{\\text{in eV}} = \\Delta G_i(0)_{\\text{in eV}} - \\nu_i U_{\\text{in V}}\n$$\n\nThe first task is to derive an algorithm for the theoretical overpotential, $\\eta_{\\text{theo}}$.

This non-negativity constraint is imposed as follows:\n    $$\n    \\eta_{\\text{theo}} = \\max(0, U_L - U_{\\text{eq}})\n    $$\n    Combining the expressions, the complete algorithm for calculating the theoretical overpotential for a given catalyst is:\n    $$\n    \\eta_{\\text{theo}} = \\max \\left( 0, \\max_{i} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta G_i(0)}{\\nu_i} \\right) - U_{\\text{eq}} \\right)\n    $$\n\nThe second task is to construct the benchmarking pipeline. For each family of catalysts, we first compute $\\eta_{\\text{theo}}$ for every member and then compare this set of theoretical values, denoted as $\\{y_{\\text{theo},j}\\}$, with the corresponding set of experimental values, $\\{y_{\\text{exp},j}\\}$. The comparison is quantified using six statistical diagnostics:\n\n1.  **Mean Signed Error (Bias)**: Measures the average systematic over- or underestimation of the theoretical model.\n    $$\n    \\text{bias} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_{\\text{theo},j} - y_{\\text{exp},j})\n    $$\n2.  **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors, insensitive to their direction.\n    $$\n    \\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} |y_{\\text{theo},j} - y_{\\text{exp},j}|\n    $$\n3.  **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: A quadratic scoring rule that penalizes larger errors more heavily.\n    $$\n    \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_{\\text{theo},j} - y_{\\text{exp},j})^2}\n    $$\n4.  **Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS) Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between experimental and theoretical values as $y_{\\text{exp}} = m \\cdot y_{\\text{theo}} + c$. The slope ($m$) and intercept ($c$) are determined by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. An ideal model would yield $m=1$ and $c=0$.\n5.  **Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($r$)**: Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the theoretical and experimental values.\n    $$\n    r = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_{\\text{theo},j} - \\bar{y}_{\\text{theo}})(y_{\\text{exp},j} - \\bar{y}_{\\text{exp}})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_{\\text{theo},j} - \\bar{y}_{\\text{theo}})^2 \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_{\\text{exp},j} - \\bar{y}_{\\text{exp}})^2}}\n    $$\n6.  **Calibrated Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE_cal)**: Measures the RMSE of the model *after* a linear calibration has been applied. It quantifies the residual error that cannot be explained by a simple linear correction. First, calibrated theoretical values are computed: $y_{\\text{theo,cal},j} = m \\cdot y_{\\text{theo},j} + c$. Then, the calibrated RMSE is calculated:\n    $$\n    \\text{RMSE}_{\\text{cal}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (y_{\\text{exp},j} - y_{\\text{theo,cal},j})^2}\n    $$\n\nThe implementation will process each family of catalysts by first calculating the vector of theoretical overpotentials, $\\mathbf{y}_{\\text{theo}}$, using the derived formula. Then, using this vector and the provided vector of experimental overpotentials, $\\mathbf{y}_{\\text{exp}}$, it will compute the six statistical metrics listed above. All final numerical results will be rounded to three decimal places.",
