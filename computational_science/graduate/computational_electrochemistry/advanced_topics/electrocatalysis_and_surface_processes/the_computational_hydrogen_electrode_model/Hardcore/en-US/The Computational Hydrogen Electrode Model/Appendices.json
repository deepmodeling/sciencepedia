            "problem": "You are asked to implement a complete, runnable program that computes the Gibbs free energy change for the adsorption of hydrogen, denoted by $H^*$, on a metal surface within the Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) model. The adsorption reaction is $H^+ + e^- + * \\rightarrow H^*$, where $*$ represents a vacant surface site. The goal is to evaluate the free energy change $\\Delta G$ for this adsorption process at $T=298$ K by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) electronic energies with vibrational zero-point energy and entropy corrections, and by referencing the electrochemical proton-electron reservoir via the CHE framework.\n\nFundamental base:\n- The Gibbs free energy $G$ for a given state is given by $G = U + pV - T S$, where $U$ is the internal energy, $p$ the pressure, $V$ the volume, $T$ the temperature, and $S$ the entropy. In standard DFT-based solid-state calculations, $pV$ can be neglected for the solid phases, and $U$ is approximated by the computed electronic energy $E_{\\mathrm{DFT}}$ plus the vibrational zero-point energy. Therefore, for a state $X$, we write $G_X \\approx E_X + \\mathrm{ZPE}_X - T S_X$ with all quantities expressed consistently per particle.\n- The free energy change for the adsorption reaction is defined by the reaction stoichiometry: $\\Delta G = G_{H^*} - G_{*} - \\mu_{H^+} - \\mu_{e^-}$, where $\\mu_{H^+}$ and $\\mu_{e^-}$ are the chemical potentials of the proton and electron, respectively.\n- The Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) model equates the combined chemical potential of the proton-electron pair to the chemical potential of molecular hydrogen subject to the electrode potential and solution acidity. Using the Nernst relation for the proton activity $a_{H^+}$ and the definition of electrode potential $U$ referenced to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE), the CHE relation is $\\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-} = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\mu_{H_2}(T,p_{H_2}) - e U - k_B T \\ln(10)\\,\\mathrm{pH}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $p_{H_2}=1$ bar under standard conditions.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in computational electrochemistry. The task is to compute the Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G$, for the hydrogen adsorption reaction $H^+ + e^- + * \\rightarrow H^*$ on a metal surface, using the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model.\n\nThe fundamental relationship for the Gibbs free energy change of this reaction is given by the difference in the free energies of the products and reactants:\n$$\n\\Delta G = G_{H^*} - G_{*} - (\\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-})\n$$\nwhere $G_{H^*}$ is the Gibbs free energy of the surface with an adsorbed hydrogen atom, $G_{*}$ is the free energy of the clean surface site, and $\\mu_{H^+}$ and $\\mu_{e^-}$ are the chemical potentials of the proton and the electron in the solution, respectively.\n\nThe calculation is systematically performed by adhering to the three algorithmic tasks specified.\n\n**1. Computation of the Surface Free Energy Difference ($G_{H^*} - G_{*}$)**\n\nFor condensed phases, the Gibbs free energy $G$ of a state $X$ is approximated by combining its DFT-calculated electronic energy $E_X$ with the vibrational zero-point energy $\\mathrm{ZPE}_X$ and the vibrational entropy term $T S_X$, neglecting the pressure-volume ($pV$) contribution.\n$$\nG_X \\approx E_X + \\mathrm{ZPE}_X - T S_X\n$$\nThe change in free energy upon adsorption of a hydrogen atom onto a surface site $*$ is the difference between the free energy of the surface with the adsorbate ($H^*$) and the free energy of the clean surface ($*$).\nThe state $H^*$ corresponds to the entire `surf+H` system, so its energy is $E_{\\mathrm{surf}+H}$, and it includes the vibrational contributions of the adsorbate, $\\mathrm{ZPE}_{H^*}$ and $S_{H^*}$. The state $*$ corresponds to the clean `surf` system, with energy $E_{\\mathrm{surf}}$. The vibrational contributions from the clean site itself are considered part of the constant background and are thus taken as zero for this differential calculation.\nTherefore, the free energy difference is:\n$$\nG_{H^*} - G_{*} \\approx (E_{\\mathrm{surf}+H} - E_{\\mathrm{surf}}) + \\mathrm{ZPE}_{H^*} - T S_{H^*}\n$$\nThis term represents the change in the surface's free energy due to the adsorption event.\n\n**2. Computation of the Proton-Electron Pair Chemical Potential ($\\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-}$)**\n\nThe CHE model provides a way to express the chemical potential of the solvated proton-electron pair, $\\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-}$, by relating it to the chemical potential of gas-phase molecular hydrogen, $\\mu_{H_2}$. This establishes an equilibrium with the hydrogen evolution reaction, $2H^+ + 2e^- \\leftrightarrow H_2$. The relation is dependent on the electrode potential $U$ and the solution's $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n\nThe CHE relation is:\n$$\n\\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{H_2}(T, p_{H_2}) - eU - k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}\n$$\nHere, $e$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and the chemical potential of molecular hydrogen is taken at a standard pressure $p_{H_2} = 1~\\text{bar}$. The term $eU$ represents the energy change of an electron moving through a potential $U$; when $U$ is in Volts (V), this energy is numerically equal to $U$ in electron-volts (eV). The term involving $\\mathrm{pH}$ accounts for the concentration of $H^+$ ions in the solution relative to standard conditions ($\\mathrm{pH}=0$).\n\nThe chemical potential of molecular hydrogen, $\\mu_{H_2}$, is calculated similarly to the solid-state free energies:\n$$\n\\mu_{H_2} \\equiv G_{H_2} \\approx E_{H_2} + \\mathrm{ZPE}_{H_2} - T S_{H_2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the CHE relation yields the full expression for the reactant chemical potentials:\n$$\n\\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (E_{H_2} + \\mathrm{ZPE}_{H_2} - T S_{H_2}) - eU - k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}\n$$\n\n**3. Final Combination for $\\Delta G$**\n\nBy substituting the expressions from steps 1 and 2 into the primary equation for $\\Delta G$, we obtain the complete formula for the Gibbs free energy change of hydrogen adsorption:\n$$\n\\Delta G \\approx \\left[ (E_{\\mathrm{surf}+H} - E_{\\mathrm{surf}}) + \\mathrm{ZPE}_{H^*} - T S_{H^*} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (E_{H_2} + \\mathrm{ZPE}_{H_2} - T S_{H_2}) - eU - k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\right]\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to group terms by their physical origin:\n$$\n\\Delta G \\approx \\underbrace{(E_{\\mathrm{surf}+H} - E_{\\mathrm{surf}} - \\frac{1}{2} E_{H_2})}_{\\Delta E} + \\underbrace{(\\mathrm{ZPE}_{H^*} - \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{ZPE}_{H_2})}_{\\Delta \\mathrm{ZPE}} - \\underbrace{T(S_{H^*} - \\frac{1}{2} S_{H_2})}_{-T\\Delta S} + eU + k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH}\n$$\nThe first term, $\\Delta E$, is the differential electronic adsorption energy. The aforementioned formula is implemented in the provided program to compute $\\Delta G$ for each test case using the given parameters and constants: $k_B = 8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}~\\text{eV/K}$ and the natural logarithm of $10$, $\\ln(10)$.",

Use the thermodynamic identity that for any species $i$, the chemical potential is $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + k_B T \\ln a_i + z_i e \\phi$, where $k_B$ is Boltzmann’s constant, $T$ is temperature, $a_i$ is activity, $z_i$ is the charge number, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $\\phi$ is the electrostatic potential.\n- The Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) on the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) scale relates the combined chemical potential of the proton and electron to molecular hydrogen. The dependence on $pH$ arises from the proton activity term. Work on the SHE scale with electrode potential $U$ expressed in volts. Use the identity $a_{H^+} = 10^{-pH}$.\n- The density functional theory adsorption descriptor $ \\Delta E_{H^*} $ is the electronic energy change for forming $H^*$ from $\\tfrac{1}{2}H_2(g)$, neglecting zero-point energy and entropic terms. The corresponding Gibbs free energy change includes zero-point and entropic corrections that you will model thermochemically.\n- For predicted relative activity, assume a symmetric, descriptor-based volcano in which the rate-determining barrier is approximated by the absolute deviation of the free energy driving force from thermoneutrality. Under transition state theory, take the predicted relative activity to scale as $\\exp\\!\\left(-\\left|\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}\\right|/(k_B T)\\right)$, where $\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective free energy change of $H^*$ formation at the specified conditions.\n\nThermochemical models to compare:\n\n- Model $\\mathrm{M1}$ (“standard”): include a zero-point energy correction of $\\Delta \\mathrm{ZPE} = 0.04$ eV to $ \\Delta E_{H^*}$. Include an entropic penalty $-T \\Delta S$ of $0.20$ eV at $T = 298.15$ K, proportional to $T$ (i.e., scale linearly with $T$).\n- Model $\\mathrm{M2}$ (“vibrational entropy included”): $\\Delta \\mathrm{ZPE} = 0.04$ eV and $-T \\Delta S = 0.16$ eV at $T = 298.15$ K, proportional to $T$.\n- Model $\\mathrm{M3}$ (“low hydrogen pressure” at $p_{H_2} = 0.1$ bar): $\\Delta \\mathrm{ZPE} = 0.04$ eV and $-T \\Delta S = 0.23$ eV at $T = 298.15$ K, proportional to $T$.\n\nAll energies must be in electronvolts. Treat $eU$ in electronvolts by noting that $1$ eV corresponds to $1$ V times the elementary charge. Use $k_B = 8.617333262145 \\times 10^{-5}$ eV/K. Use $\\ln(10) = 2.302585093$.\n\nTasks your program must perform for each test case:\n\n- Compute the effective free energy change $\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}$ for $H^*$ formation at given $ \\Delta E_{H^*}$, thermochemical model, $T$, $pH$, and $U$ on the SHE scale, using only the fundamental relations above.\n- Compute the predicted relative activity $A = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\left|\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}\\right|/(k_B T)\\right)$.\n- Define a baseline activity $A_0$ for the same $ \\Delta E_{H^*}$, $T$, and $U$ but at $pH = 0$ using Model $\\mathrm{M1}$. Compute the activity ratio $r = A / A_0$ (dimensionless, to be reported as a decimal).\n- Determine the volcano apex position on the descriptor axis, namely the value of $ \\Delta E_{H^*}$ at which $\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}} = 0$ for the specified thermochemical model, $T$, $pH$, and $U$. Report this apex location in eV.\n\nPhysical units and formatting:\n\n- Report the volcano apex location in eV, rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n- Report the activity ratio $r$ as a decimal number (no percent sign), rounded to $6$ decimal places.\n\nTest suite to implement and evaluate:\n\nEach test case is a tuple $(\\mathrm{model}, \\Delta E_{H^*}\\text{ in eV}, T\\text{ in K}, pH, U\\text{ in V vs SHE})$.\n\n- Test case $1$: $(\\mathrm{M1}, -0.10, 298.15, 0, 0.0)$\n- Test case $2$: $(\\mathrm{M1}, -0.10, 298.15, 14, 0.0)$\n- Test case $3$: $(\\mathrm{M2}, -0.10, 298.15, 0, 0.0)$\n- Test case $4$: $(\\mathrm{M3}, -0.10, 298.15, 0, 0.0)$\n- Test case $5$: $(\\mathrm{M3}, 0.00, 298.15, 14, 0.0)$\n- Test case $6$: $(\\mathrm{M2}, 0.20, 350.00, 7, 0.0)$\n\nFinal output format:\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing a list of per-test-case results, where each result is a two-element list $[\\Delta E_{\\text{apex}}\\text{ (eV)}, r]$ with both entries rounded as specified. The entire output must be a single bracketed list of these two-element lists, for example: $[[x_1,y_1],[x_2,y_2],\\dots]$ with numeric entries.\n\nNo input is read; all constants and the test suite values are hard-coded as specified above. The program must be self-contained and runnable as provided.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically examined and is determined to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational electrochemistry and thermodynamics, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nHerein, a detailed derivation and algorithmic procedure are presented to solve the problem.\n\nThe fundamental reaction under consideration is the formation of an adsorbed hydrogen atom on a catalytic surface, which is an elementary step in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER):\n$$ H^+ + e^- + * \\rightarrow H^* $$\nwhere $H^+$ denotes a proton in solution, $e^-$ is an electron from the electrode, $*$ is an unoccupied surface active site, and $H^*$ is a hydrogen atom adsorbed onto a site.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy change for this reaction, which we denote as $\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}$, is given by the difference in chemical potentials between the products and reactants:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{eff}} = \\mu_{H^*} - (\\mu_{*} + \\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-}) $$\nThis expression can be rearranged to group surface-related and solution/electrode-related terms:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{eff}} = (\\mu_{H^*} - \\mu_{*}) - (\\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-}) $$\n\nThe core of the problem lies in expressing these two parenthetical terms as functions of the given parameters: the electronic energy descriptor $\\Delta E_{H^*}$, temperature $T$, $pH$, and electrode potential $U$.\n\n**1. The Chemical Potential of the Proton-Electron Pair $(\\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-})$**\n\nThe Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) model provides a framework for relating the chemical potential of a proton-electron pair in an electrochemical environment to the chemical potential of gaseous hydrogen, $H_2(g)$. The reference equilibrium is:\n$$ H^+ + e^- \\rightleftharpoons \\frac{1}{2} H_2(g) $$\nUnder standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) conditions ($U = 0$ V, $pH=0$ which means $a_{H^+} = 1$, and $p_{H_2} = 1$ bar at a given temperature $T$), this equilibrium dictates that the chemical potential of the pair is equal to half the chemical potential of a hydrogen molecule:\n$$ \\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{H_2(g)} \\quad (\\text{at SHE conditions}) $$\nNow, we introduce the effects of non-standard $pH$ and potential $U$. The chemical potential of a species $i$ is given by $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + k_B T \\ln a_i + z_i e \\phi$.\nFor a proton ($z_i = +1$), its potential depends on its activity $a_{H^+} = 10^{-pH}$:\n$$ \\mu_{H^+} = \\mu_{H^+}^\\circ + k_B T \\ln(10^{-pH}) = \\mu_{H^+}^\\circ - k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot pH $$\nFor an electron ($z_i = -1$) in an electrode at potential $U$ relative to the SHE, its chemical potential is shifted by $-eU$:\n$$ \\mu_{e^-} = \\mu_{e^-, \\text{SHE}} - eU $$\nCombining these, the chemical potential of the pair at arbitrary $(pH, U)$ is:\n$$ \\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-} = (\\mu_{H^+}^\\circ + \\mu_{e^-, \\text{SHE}}) - k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot pH - eU $$\nRecognizing that $(\\mu_{H^+}^\\circ + \\mu_{e^-, \\text{SHE}})$ is the pair's potential under standard conditions, we substitute the CHE equilibrium condition:\n$$ \\mu_{H^+} + \\mu_{e^-} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{H_2(g)}^\\circ - k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot pH - eU $$\nwhere $\\mu_{H_2(g)}^\\circ$ is the chemical potential of $H_2(g)$ at $p_{H_2} = 1$ bar. The problem specifies that the term $eU$ can be written simply as $U$ with units of electronvolts (eV) when $U$ is in Volts.\n\n**2. The Chemical Potential of Adsorbed Hydrogen $(\\mu_{H^*} - \\mu_{*})$**\n\nThis term represents the free energy of the adsorbed hydrogen atom relative to the bare surface. We relate this to the given DFT descriptor $\\Delta E_{H^*}$. The descriptor is defined for the reaction $* + \\frac{1}{2}H_2(g) \\rightarrow H^*$, representing the electronic energy change. The corresponding Gibbs free energy change for this process, $\\Delta G_{H^*}$, includes thermochemical corrections for zero-point energy ($\\Delta \\text{ZPE}$) and entropy ($\\Delta S$):\n$$ \\Delta G_{H^*} = \\Delta E_{H^*} + \\Delta G_{corr} = \\Delta E_{H^*} + \\Delta \\text{ZPE} - T \\Delta S $$\nAlso by definition, $\\Delta G_{H^*}$ is the difference in chemical potential:\n$$ \\Delta G_{H^*} = (\\mu_{H^*} - \\mu_{*}) - \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{H_2(g)}^\\circ $$\nFrom this, we can express the surface term as:\n$$ \\mu_{H^*} - \\mu_{*} = \\Delta G_{H^*} + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{H_2(g)}^\\circ = (\\Delta E_{H^*} + \\Delta G_{corr}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{H_2(g)}^\\circ $$\n\nThe problem specifies that the entropic contribution, $-T \\Delta S$, is proportional to temperature $T$. Given a reference value $(-T \\Delta S)_{ref}$ at a reference temperature $T_{ref} = 298.15$ K, the value at any temperature $T$ is:\n$$ -T \\Delta S = (-T_{ref} \\Delta S) \\frac{T}{T_{ref}} $$\nLet $C_{ref} = (-T \\Delta S)_{ref}$. The total thermochemical correction is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{corr}(T) = \\Delta \\text{ZPE} + C_{ref} \\frac{T}{T_{ref}} $$\n\n**3. The Final Expression for $\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}$**\n\nSubstituting the expressions for both parenthetical terms back into the equation for $\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{eff}} = \\left( (\\Delta E_{H^*} + \\Delta G_{corr}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{H_2(g)}^\\circ \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{H_2(g)}^\\circ - k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot pH - eU \\right) $$\nThe $\\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{H_2(g)}^\\circ$ terms cancel, yielding the final working equation. Using the convention that $eU$ in eV is numerically equal to $U$ in Volts:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{eff}} = \\Delta E_{H^*} + \\Delta G_{corr} + k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot pH + U $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{eff}} = \\Delta E_{H^*} + \\left(\\Delta \\text{ZPE} + C_{ref} \\frac{T}{298.15~\\text{K}}\\right) + k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot pH + U $$\n\n**4. Calculation of Required Quantities**\n\n- **Volcano Apex Position ($\\Delta E_{\\text{apex}}$)**: The activity volcano apex corresponds to the most favorable condition, where the driving force is thermoneutral, i.e., $\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}} = 0$. We solve for the descriptor value, $\\Delta E_{H^*} = \\Delta E_{\\text{apex}}$, that satisfies this condition:\n  $$ 0 = \\Delta E_{\\text{apex}} + \\Delta G_{corr} + k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot pH + U $$\n  $$ \\Delta E_{\\text{apex}} = -(\\Delta G_{corr} + k_B T \\ln(10) \\cdot pH + U) $$\n\n- **Activity Ratio ($r$)**: The predicted relative activity $A$ is given by $A = \\exp(-\\left|\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}\\right|/(k_B T))$. The ratio $r$ is defined as $r = A/A_0$, where $A_0$ is the activity under baseline conditions (same $\\Delta E_{H^*}, T, U$, but with Model $\\mathrm{M1}$ and $pH=0$).\n  First, we compute $\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}$ for the specified test case conditions.\n  Second, we compute $\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}, 0}$ for the baseline conditions. The $pH$ term becomes zero, and $\\Delta G_{corr, 0}$ is calculated using Model $\\mathrm{M1}$ parameters:\n  $$ \\Delta G_{\\text{eff}, 0} = \\Delta E_{H^*} + \\left(\\Delta \\text{ZPE}_{\\mathrm{M1}} + C_{ref, \\mathrm{M1}} \\frac{T}{298.15~\\text{K}}\\right) + U $$\n  The activity ratio $r$ is then:\n  $$ r = \\frac{A}{A_0} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\left|\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}\\right|/(k_B T))}{\\exp(-\\left|\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}, 0}\\right|/(k_B T))} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\left|\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}, 0}\\right| - \\left|\\Delta G_{\\text{eff}}\\right|}{k_B T} \\right) $$\n\nThese derived formulae are implemented in the following Python code to process the specified test suite.",
