            "problem": "An electrocatalytic oxidation reaction on a metal electrode in an aqueous electrolyte is studied under conditions where mass transport is not rate limiting and the microkinetics are governed by a single, rate-determining electron-transfer step ($n=1$). At temperature $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the anodic Tafel slope is measured to be $120\\ \\mathrm{mV/dec}$. In the same regime, a steady-state anodic current density of $j=7.50\\ \\mathrm{A\\ m^{-2}}$ is recorded at an overpotential $\\eta=+0.160\\ \\mathrm{V}$, referenced to the equilibrium potential of the reaction.\n\nStarting from fundamental electrochemical kinetics and the transition-state picture of electron transfer, use the connection between the Tafel slope and the transfer coefficient to infer the kinetic transfer coefficient $\\alpha$ for the rate-determining step. Then, using the appropriate large-overpotential limit of the Butler–Volmer (BV) relation, estimate the exchange current density $j_{0}$ from the measured current at the known overpotential.\n\nExpress the final exchange current density in $\\mathrm{A\\ m^{-2}}$. Round both $\\alpha$ and $j_{0}$ to three significant figures. Your final answer must be a calculation in the form of two numbers: the first is $\\alpha$ and the second is $j_{0}$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the determination of the kinetic transfer coefficient, $\\alpha$, and the exchange current density, $j_{0}$, for an electrocatalytic oxidation reaction. The solution proceeds in two main steps: first, calculating $\\alpha$ from the given anodic Tafel slope, and second, using this information along with the measured current density at a specific overpotential to find $j_{0}$.\n\nThe microkinetics of the reaction are described by the Butler-Volmer equation. For a single-step, one-electron ($n=1$) transfer process, the net current density $j$ as a function of overpotential $\\eta$ is given by:\n$$j = j_{0} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{a}} n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}} n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) \\right)$$\nwhere $j_{0}$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{a}}$ and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}}$ are the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients, respectively, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. For a single elementary step, it is assumed that $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{a}} + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{c}} = 1$.\n\nThe problem states that an anodic current is measured at a positive overpotential ($\\eta = +0.160\\ \\mathrm{V}$). Under these conditions ($\\eta \\gg RT/F$), the contribution from the cathodic (second) term is negligible. This is the large-overpotential limit, also known as the Tafel regime. The Butler-Volmer equation simplifies to the Tafel equation for the anodic branch:\n$$j \\approx j_{\\mathrm{a}} = j_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\mathrm{a}} n F \\eta}{R T}\\right)$$\nHere, $j_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is the anodic current density. The problem asks for \"the kinetic transfer coefficient $\\alpha$ for the rate-determining step\". Since the rate-determining step is the anodic oxidation, this $\\alpha$ corresponds to the anodic transfer coefficient, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{a}}$. We will henceforth denote it simply as $\\alpha$.\n\nThe anodic Tafel slope, $b_{\\mathrm{a}}$, is defined as the change in overpotential required for the current density to increase by one order of magnitude. It is related to the transfer coefficient by the equation:\n$$b_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\frac{\\ln(10) R T}{\\alpha n F}$$\nThis equation provides the direct connection between the experimentally measured Tafel slope and the transfer coefficient. We can now solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{\\ln(10) R T}{b_{\\mathrm{a}} n F}$$\nWe are given $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $b_{\\mathrm{a}} = 120\\ \\mathrm{mV/dec} = 0.120\\ \\mathrm{V/dec}$, and $n=1$. We use the standard values for the constants $R = 8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$ and $F = 96485\\ \\mathrm{C\\ mol^{-1}}$. The term $\\ln(10)RT/F$ is a useful quantity in electrochemistry.\n$$\\frac{\\ln(10) R T}{F} \\approx \\frac{2.303 \\times (8.314\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\ \\mathrm{K})}{96485\\ \\mathrm{C\\ mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.05916\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nSubstituting this value into our expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{0.05916\\ \\mathrm{V}}{0.120\\ \\mathrm{V} \\times 1} = 0.493$$\nSo, the transfer coefficient for the anodic step, rounded to three significant figures, is $0.493$.\n\nNext, we calculate the exchange current density, $j_{0}$. We use the Tafel equation, which can be rearranged to solve for $j_0$:\n$$j_{0} = j \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta}{R T}\\right)$$\nAlternatively, a more direct approach uses the definition of the Tafel slope. The Tafel equation can be expressed as $\\eta = b_{\\mathrm{a}} \\log_{10}(j/j_{0})$. Solving this equation for $j_0$ gives:\n$$j_{0} = j \\cdot 10^{-\\eta / b_{\\mathrm{a}}}$$\nThis expression relates $j_{0}$ directly to the measured experimental quantities ($j$, $\\eta$, and $b_{\\mathrm{a}}$).\nWe are given $j = 7.50\\ \\mathrm{A\\ m^{-2}}$ at $\\eta = +0.160\\ \\mathrm{V}$, and we have $b_{\\mathrm{a}} = 0.120\\ \\mathrm{V/dec}$.\n$$j_{0} = (7.50\\ \\mathrm{A\\ m^{-2}}) \\times 10^{-(0.160\\ \\mathrm{V}) / (0.120\\ \\mathrm{V/dec})}$$\n$$j_{0} = (7.50\\ \\mathrm{A\\ m^{-2}}) \\times 10^{-4/3}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$j_{0} = 7.50 \\times 10^{-1.333...} \\approx 7.50 \\times 0.046416 \\approx 0.34812\\ \\mathrm{A\\ m^{-2}}$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$j_{0} = 0.348\\ \\mathrm{A\\ m^{-2}}$$\n\nThe two requested quantities are the transfer coefficient $\\alpha$ and the exchange current density $j_{0}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the potential-dependent reaction free energy, $\\Delta G(E)$, for an electrocatalytic step within the framework of the Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) model, and its application to compute the potential at which hydrogen adsorption/desorption is thermoneutral.\n\nWe begin from the first principles of thermodynamics at an electrochemical interface. In a grand-canonical ensemble description, the electrode potential $E$ fixes the electrochemical potential of the electrons, $\\bar{\\mu}_{e^-}$, in the electrode. The Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) model provides a reference for the energy of a proton-electron pair, $(\\mathrm{H}^+ + e^-)$. It is based on the equilibrium condition for the Reversible Hydrogen Electrode (RHE), where the reaction $\\mathrm{H}^+ + e^- \\rightleftharpoons \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{H}_2(g)$ is at equilibrium at $E=0\\ \\mathrm{V}$ versus RHE, by definition.

On the RHE scale, this equilibrium holds by definition at $E=0\\ \\mathrm{V}$ for any $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n\nWhen the electrode potential is changed from $0\\ \\mathrm{V}$ to a value $E$ (vs. RHE), the electrochemical potential of the electron in the electrode changes by $-eE$. Thus, the electrochemical potential of the electron at potential $E$ is related to its potential at $E=0$ by:\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}_{e^-}(E) = \\bar{\\mu}_{e^-}(E=0) - eE $$\nAssuming the chemical environment of the proton is constant, the electrochemical potential of the proton-electron pair becomes:\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}(\\mathrm{H}^+ + e^-)(E) = \\bar{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^+} + \\bar{\\mu}_{e^-}(E) = (\\bar{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{H}^+} + \\bar{\\mu}_{e^-}(E=0)) - eE $$\nUsing the RHE equilibrium condition, we arrive at the central equation of the CHE model:\n$$ \\bar{\\mu}(\\mathrm{H}^+ + e^-)(E) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}_2(g)} - eE $$\n\nNow, consider a general electrochemical reaction step involving the transfer of $n$ proton-electron pairs, written as a reduction:\n$$ A + n(\\mathrm{H}^+ + e^-) \\rightarrow B $$\nThe reaction free energy $\\Delta G(E)$ is the difference between the free energies of the products and the reactants:\n$$ \\Delta G(E) = G_B - (G_A + n \\bar{\\mu}(\\mathrm{H}^+ + e^-)(E)) $$\nSubstituting the CHE expression for the proton-electron pair:\n$$ \\Delta G(E) = G_B - G_A - n \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}_2(g)} - eE \\right) = \\left( G_B - G_A - \\frac{n}{2}\\mu_{\\mathrm{H}_2(g)} \\right) + neE $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is the reaction free energy at $E=0\\ \\mathrm{V}$, which we denote as $\\Delta G(0)$.

The reaction free energy for adsorption, $\\Delta G_{ads}(E)$, is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{ads}(E) = \\Delta G_{ads}(0) + eE $$\nThe free energy at zero potential, $\\Delta G_{ads}(0)$, is the free energy change for the reaction $* + \\mathrm{H}^+ + e^- \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H}^*$ at $E=0\\ \\mathrm{V}$.
