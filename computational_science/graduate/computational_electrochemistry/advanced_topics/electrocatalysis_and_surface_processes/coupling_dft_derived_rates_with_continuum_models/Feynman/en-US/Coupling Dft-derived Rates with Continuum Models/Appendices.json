            "problem": "In a grand-canonical description of an electrified interface, adsorption occurs at fixed electrode potential.

The adsorption free energy at zero potential is known from first-principles thermodynamics to be $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0} = -0.10~\\mathrm{eV}$. A Bader charge analysis of the adsorbate region (defined as the set of atoms that comprise the chemisorbed fragment) yields an excess electronic charge of $-0.50$ (in units of the elementary charge) relative to the corresponding neutral fragment in vacuum, evaluated in the interfacial geometry.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the relationship between adsorption free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}$, and electrode potential, $U$. In an electrochemical system held at a constant potential $U$ by an external potentiostat, the electrons in the electrode act as a particle bath with a tunable chemical potential. The appropriate thermodynamic potential for this system is the grand-canonical potential, $\\Omega$.\n\nThe electrochemical potential of an electron, $\\tilde{\\mu}_e$, in an electrode at potential $U$ relative to a reference electrode is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_e = \\mu_e^{\\text{ref}} - eU\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_e^{\\text{ref}}$ is the chemical potential of the electrons at the reference potential ($U=0$), and $e$ is the elementary charge (a positive constant).\n\nThe free energy of adsorption, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(U)$, at a potential $U$ is defined as the change in the grand-canonical potential, $\\Delta \\Omega$, for the adsorption process. The grand-canonical potential is defined as $\\Omega = G - N_e \\tilde{\\mu}_e$, where $G$ is the Gibbs free energy and $N_e$ is the number of electrons in the system.\n\nLet the initial state be the bare surface and the species in a reference state, and the final state be the surface with the adsorbate. The change in the grand potential is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(U) = \\Omega_{\\mathrm{final}} - \\Omega_{\\mathrm{initial}} = (G_{\\mathrm{final}} - N_{e, \\mathrm{final}} \\tilde{\\mu}_e) - (G_{\\mathrm{initial}} - N_{e, \\mathrm{initial}} \\tilde{\\mu}_e)\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(U) = (G_{\\mathrm{final}} - G_{\\mathrm{initial}}) - (N_{e, \\mathrm{final}} - N_{e, \\mathrm{initial}}) \\tilde{\\mu}_e\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tilde{\\mu}_e$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(U) = (G_{\\mathrm{final}} - G_{\\mathrm{initial}}) - (N_{e, \\mathrm{final}} - N_{e, \\mathrm{initial}})(\\mu_e^{\\text{ref}} - eU)\n$$\nDistributing the terms:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(U) = \\left[ (G_{\\mathrm{final}} - G_{\\mathrm{initial}}) - (N_{e, \\mathrm{final}} - N_{e, \\mathrm{initial}})\\mu_e^{\\text{ref}} \\right] + (N_{e, \\mathrm{final}} - N_{e, \\mathrm{initial}})eU\n$$\nThe term in the square brackets represents the adsorption free energy at $U=0$, which is the given $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0}$.\nThus:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(U) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0} + (N_{e, \\mathrm{final}} - N_{e, \\mathrm{initial}})eU\n$$\nThe term $(N_{e, \\mathrm{final}} - N_{e, \\mathrm{initial}})$ is the net number of electrons, $\\Delta N_e$, that flow from the electrode into the adsorbate system upon adsorption. The problem defines an effective charge number, $q_{\\mathrm{ads}}$, as the excess charge on the adsorbate in units of the elementary charge, $e$. The charge accumulated on the adsorbate is $Q_{\\mathrm{ads}} = -e \\Delta N_e$. Therefore, $q_{\\mathrm{ads}} = Q_{\\mathrm{ads}}/e = -\\Delta N_e$. This implies that $\\Delta N_e = -q_{\\mathrm{ads}}$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(U)$ yields the desired linear relationship:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(U) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0} - q_{\\mathrm{ads}}eU\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(U)$ at $U = 0.85~\\mathrm{V}$. The problem provides the following values:\n- $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0} = -0.10~\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $U = 0.85~\\mathrm{V}$\n- The excess electronic charge is given as $-0.50$, so $q_{\\mathrm{ads}} = -0.50$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(0.85~\\mathrm{V}) = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{0} - q_{\\mathrm{ads}}e(0.85~\\mathrm{V})\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the product $eU$ should be expressed in electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$). For $U$ in volts, $eU$ numerically equals $U$ in units of $\\mathrm{eV}$. So, $e(0.85~\\mathrm{V}) = 0.85~\\mathrm{eV}$.\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(0.85~\\mathrm{V}) = -0.10~\\mathrm{eV} - (-0.50) \\times (0.85~\\mathrm{eV})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(0.85~\\mathrm{V}) = -0.10~\\mathrm{eV} + (0.50 \\times 0.85)~\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(0.85~\\mathrm{V}) = -0.10~\\mathrm{eV} + 0.425~\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{ads}}(0.85~\\mathrm{V}) = 0.325~\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value of $0.325$ already has three significant figures (the digits $3$, $2$, and $5$). The final answer is $0.325~\\mathrm{eV}$.",

The solution proceeds by first establishing a governing equation for the reactant concentration at the electrode surface, solving it, and then using the resulting expression for current density to numerically compute the Tafel slope.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state condition where the diffusive flux of the reactant to the electrode surface, $J_{\\mathrm{diff}}$, is equal to the reactive consumption flux at the surface, $J_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$.\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{diff}} = J_{\\mathrm{rxn}}\n$$\nThe diffusive flux is described by Fick's first law under a linear concentration gradient across a diffusion layer of thickness $\\delta$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{diff}} = \\frac{D}{\\delta}\\left(c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} - c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $c_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ is the bulk reactant concentration, and $c_{\\mathrm{surf}}$ is the reactant concentration at the electrode surface.\n\nThe reactive flux is modeled as a first-order process with respect to the surface concentration, but modulated by the fraction of available active sites, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{free}}(U, c_{\\mathrm{surf}})$:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = k(U)\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\,\\theta_{\\mathrm{free}}(U, c_{\\mathrm{surf}})\n$$\nHere, $k(U)$ is the potential-dependent intrinsic rate constant, given by:\n$$\nk(U) = k_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\,n\\,F\\,(U - U_{\\mathrm{ref}})}{R\\,T}\\right)\n$$\nAnd $\\theta_{\\mathrm{free}}(U, c_{\\mathrm{surf}})$ is the fraction of free sites, given by a Langmuir-like isotherm with potential dependence:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{free}}(U, c_{\\mathrm{surf}}) = \\frac{1}{1 + K\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\,\\exp(-\\gamma\\,U)}\n$$\n\nEquating the flux expressions yields the governing equation for $c_{\\mathrm{surf}}(U)$:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\delta}\\left(c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} - c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\right) = k(U)\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\,\\frac{1}{1 + K\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\,\\exp(-\\gamma\\,U)}\n$$\nTo solve for $c_{\\mathrm{surf}}$, we rearrange this equation. Multiplying both sides by the denominator of the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\delta}\\left(c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} - c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\right)\\left(1 + K\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\,\\exp(-\\gamma\\,U)\\right) = k(U)\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\n$$\nExpanding the left side:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{\\delta}\\left(c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} + K\\,c_{\\mathrm{bulk}}\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\,\\exp(-\\gamma\\,U) - c_{\\mathrm{surf}} - K\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}^2\\,\\exp(-\\gamma\\,U)\\right) = k(U)\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}\n$$\nThis can be arranged into a standard quadratic equation of the form $A\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}}^2 + B\\,c_{\\mathrm{surf}} + C = 0$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{D}{\\delta} K \\exp(-\\gamma U)\\right) c_{\\mathrm{surf}}^2 + \\left(k(U) + \\frac{D}{\\delta} - \\frac{D}{\\delta} c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} K \\exp(-\\gamma U)\\right) c_{\\mathrm{surf}} - \\frac{D}{\\delta} c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = 0\n$$\nThe coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ are thus defined as:\n$$\nA = \\frac{D}{\\delta} K \\exp(-\\gamma U)\n$$\n$$\nB = k(U) + \\frac{D}{\\delta} - \\frac{D}{\\delta} c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} K \\exp(-\\gamma U)\n$$\n$$\nC = -\\frac{D}{\\delta} c_{\\mathrm{bulk}}\n$$\nThis quadratic equation is solved for $c_{\\mathrm{surf}}(U)$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{surf}}(U) = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\n$$\nSince $A \\ge 0$ (as $D, \\delta, K \\ge 0$) and $C < 0$ (as $D, \\delta, c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} > 0$), the term $-4AC \\ge 0$. The discriminant $B^2 - 4AC$ is therefore always non-negative, ensuring real roots. A physically meaningful concentration must be non-negative, i.e., $c_{\\mathrm{surf}} \\ge 0$. Since $\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC} \\ge |B|$, the root with the minus sign would yield a negative concentration. Thus, we must choose the positive sign:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{surf}}(U) = \\frac{-B + \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}\n$$\nIn the special case where there is no competitive adsorption ($K = 0$), the coefficient $A$ becomes $0$, and the equation simplifies to a linear one:\n$$\n\\left(k(U) + \\frac{D}{\\delta}\\right) c_{\\mathrm{surf}} - \\frac{D}{\\delta} c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = 0\n$$\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{surf}}(U) = \\frac{(D/\\delta) c_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{k(U) + D/\\delta} = c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} \\left(1 + \\frac{k(U)\\delta}{D}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n\nOnce $c_{\\mathrm{surf}}(U)$ is determined for a given potential $U$, the current density $j(U)$ is calculated from the diffusive flux:\n$$\nj(U) = n\\,F\\,J_{\\mathrm{diff}} = n\\,F\\,\\frac{D}{\\delta}\\left(c_{\\mathrm{bulk}} - c_{\\mathrm{surf}}(U)\\right)\n$$\nThe final step is to compute the apparent Tafel slope, $b_{\\mathrm{app}}$, at a specific potential $U_\\star$. The definition is:\n$$\nb_{\\mathrm{app}}(U_\\star) = \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}\\log_{10} j}\\right|_{U_\\star} = \\frac{\\ln 10}{\\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln j}{\\mathrm{d}U}\\right|_{U_\\star}}\n$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln j}{\\mathrm{d}U}$ is approximated numerically using a symmetric finite difference scheme with a small step size $h = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\ln j}{\\mathrm{d}U}\\right|_{U_\\star} \\approx \\frac{\\ln j(U_\\star + h) - \\ln j(U_\\star - h)}{2h}\n$$\nThe procedure for each test case is to:\n$1$. Calculate $j(U_\\star + h)$ and $j(U_\\star - h)$ by first solving for the respective surface concentrations $c_{\\mathrm{surf}}(U_\\star + h)$ and $c_{\\mathrm{surf}}(U_\\star - h)$.\n$2$. Use these values to compute the numerical derivative.\n$3$. Calculate $b_{\\mathrm{app}}(U_\\star)$.\n$4$. Convert the result to units of $\\mathrm{mV}/\\text{decade}$ by multiplying by $1000$ and report it rounded to two decimal places.\nThe following physical constants are used: $R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $F = 96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $T = 298.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $n = 1$.",
