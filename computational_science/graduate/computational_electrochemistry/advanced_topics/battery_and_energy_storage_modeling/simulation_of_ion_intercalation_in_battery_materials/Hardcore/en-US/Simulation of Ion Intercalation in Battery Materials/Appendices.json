It represents a standard exercise in the thermodynamics of battery materials. I will now proceed with a formal solution.\n\n**2. Detailed Solution**\n\nThe open-circuit voltage, $V$, of an electrochemical cell is determined by the difference in the chemical potential of the working ion between the cathode (the host material, $\\mathrm{Li}_x\\mathrm{A}$) and the anode (the lithium metal reservoir). The relationship is given by:\n$$\n-z e V = \\mu^{\\mathrm{cathode}} - \\mu^{\\mathrm{anode}}\n$$\nwhere $z$ is the charge number of the ion ($z=1$ for $\\mathrm{Li}^+$), $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\mu^{\\mathrm{cathode}}$ is the chemical potential of lithium in the host material, and $\\mu^{\\mathrm{anode}}$ is the chemical potential of lithium in the reference electrode. In this problem, these are $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{host}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}}$, respectively. The chemical potentials are given in units of energy (eV), so the voltage in volts is numerically equal to the potential difference in eV divided by $e$.\n$$\nV = -\\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{host}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}}}{e}\n$$\nThe problem states that a two-phase plateau exists between the deintercalated phase ($x=0$) and the fully intercalated phase ($x=1$). In a two-phase region of thermodynamic equilibrium, the chemical potential of the mobile species (Li) is constant. This constant chemical potential is determined by the common-tangent construction on the free energy curve of the host material, $E_{\\mathrm{host}}(x)$. The slope of the common tangent line connecting the free energies of the two coexisting phases gives the equilibrium chemical potential.\n\nGiven that the coexisting phases are at compositions $x_1=0$ and $x_2=1$, the chemical potential of lithium across this plateau, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{host}}$, is the slope of the line segment connecting the points $(0, E_{\\mathrm{host}}(0))$ and $(1, E_{\\mathrm{host}}(1))$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{host}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{host}}(1) - E_{\\mathrm{host}}(0)}{1 - 0} = E_{\\mathrm{host}}(1) - E_{\\mathrm{host}}(0)\n$$\nThe problem provides the expression for the host free energy:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{host}}(x) = E_{0} + V_{1}x + V_{2}x(1-x) + V_{3}x(1-x)(1-2x)\n$$\nWe evaluate this expression at the two endpoints, $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\nAt $x=0$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{host}}(0) = E_{0} + V_{1}(0) + V_{2}(0)(1-0) + V_{3}(0)(1-0)(1-0) = E_{0}\n$$\nAt $x=1$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{host}}(1) = E_{0} + V_{1}(1) + V_{2}(1)(1-1) + V_{3}(1)(1-1)(1-2) = E_{0} + V_1\n$$\nNow, we substitute these results into the expression for the chemical potential:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{host}} = (E_{0} + V_{1}) - E_{0} = V_{1}\n$$\nThis elegant result shows that for this energy model, the average voltage across the full composition range is determined solely by the linear term coefficient, $V_1$.\n\nWe can now calculate the cell voltage, $V$. We have the derived expression for the host chemical potential, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{host}} = V_1$, and the given chemical potential for the lithium metal anode, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}}$.\n$$\nV = -\\frac{V_{1} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}}}{e}\n$$\nThe problem provides the numerical values:\n$V_{1} = -5.300~\\mathrm{eV}$\n$\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}} = -1.550~\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the voltage expression:\n$$\nV = -\\frac{(-5.300~\\mathrm{eV}) - (-1.550~\\mathrm{eV})}{e} = -\\frac{-5.300~\\mathrm{eV} + 1.550~\\mathrm{eV}}{e} = -\\frac{-3.750~\\mathrm{eV}}{e}\n$$\nSince the energy is in electron-volts (eV) and is divided by the elementary charge $e$, the resulting voltage is numerically equal to $3.750$ volts.\n$$\nV = 3.750~\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $3.750$ already has four significant figures. The introduction of the grand potential $g(x)$ and the instruction to apply the common tangent to it is a potential source of confusion. However, minimizing the grand potential for a phase-separating system is the formal procedure that gives rise to the common-tangent construction on the Helmholtz/Gibbs free energy $E_{\\mathrm{host}}(x)$. The approach taken here is therefore fundamentally correct and directly follows from the provided information and core thermodynamic principles.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state physics and statistical mechanics, specifically the theory of atomic diffusion in solids. All parameters are physically realistic, well-defined, and self-consistent, forming a well-posed problem that admits a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe derivation of the tracer diffusion coefficient, $D$, begins with the fundamental definition relating it to the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of a particle undergoing a random walk. For diffusion in $d$ spatial dimensions, this relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle = 2dDt\n$$\nHere, $\\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle$ represents the average squared distance the tracer particle has moved from its origin in time $t$.\n\nNext, we model the particle's motion as a discrete sequence of hops on a lattice. Let the particle perform $N$ hops of fixed length $a$ over a time period $t$. The MSD after $N$ hops is given by:\n$$\n\\langle |\\mathbf{r}_N|^2 \\rangle = N a^2 f\n$$\nwhere $f$ is the correlation factor. For a truly random walk, where the direction of each step is independent of the previous one, $f=1$. The problem specifies a dilute vacancy-mediated mechanism and provides $f=1$, which simplifies the analysis by assuming no memory between successive hops.\n\nThe number of hops, $N$, is related to the time interval $t$ through the total hop rate, $\\Gamma$, which is the average number of hops per unit time. Thus, $N = \\Gamma t$. Substituting this into the MSD expression for the discrete walk gives:\n$$\n\\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^2 \\rangle = (\\Gamma t) a^2 f\n$$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the MSD, we can solve for the diffusion coefficient $D$:\n$$\n2dDt = \\Gamma t a^2 f\n$$\n$$\nD = \\frac{\\Gamma a^2 f}{2d}\n$$\n\nThe total hop rate $\\Gamma$ must now be determined. A tracer atom on the lattice can hop to any of its $z$ nearest-neighbor sites. The rate for a single, specific hop, denoted by $\\omega$, is given by Harmonic Transition State Theory (HTST) as an Arrhenius-type expression:\n$$\n\\omega = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\nu$ is the attempt frequency for a hop towards a single specific neighbor, $E_m$ is the migration energy barrier, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem gives values for these parameters.\n\nSince the lattice has $z$ symmetry-equivalent nearest neighbors, the total rate at which the tracer atom hops away from its current site is the sum of the rates to each neighboring site. Assuming the hop probability to one site is independent of the others, the total hop rate is:\n$$\n\\Gamma = z \\omega = z\\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Gamma$ back into the equation for $D$ yields the final symbolic formula for the tracer diffusion coefficient:\n$$\nD = \\frac{(z\\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right)) a^2 f}{2d} = \\frac{z a^2 f \\nu}{2d} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe now proceed with the numerical calculation using the provided values:\n- Number of nearest neighbors, $z = 6$\n- Hop length, $a = 2.88\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} = 2.88 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Correlation factor, $f = 1$\n- Attempt frequency, $\\nu = 7.5 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- Dimensionality, $d = 2$\n- Migration barrier, $E_m = 0.42\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- Temperature, $T = 370\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Boltzmann constant, $k_B = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the argument of the exponential function:\n$$\n\\frac{E_m}{k_B T} = \\frac{0.42\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{(8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (370\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\approx \\frac{0.42}{0.031884133} \\approx 13.17248\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the value of the diffusion coefficient $D$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{6 \\times (2.88 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm})^2 \\times 1 \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})}{2 \\times 2} \\exp(-13.17248)\n$$\n$$\nD = \\frac{6 \\times (8.2944 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})}{4} \\times (1.89862 \\times 10^{-6})\n$$\n$$\nD = (1.5) \\times (8.2944 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (1.89862 \\times 10^{-6})\n$$\n$$\nD = (1.24416 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times (1.89862 \\times 10^{-6})\n$$\n$$\nD = (9.3312 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (1.89862 \\times 10^{-6})\n$$\n$$\nD \\approx 1.7716 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, we obtain:\n$$\nD \\approx 1.77 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2/s}\n$$",
