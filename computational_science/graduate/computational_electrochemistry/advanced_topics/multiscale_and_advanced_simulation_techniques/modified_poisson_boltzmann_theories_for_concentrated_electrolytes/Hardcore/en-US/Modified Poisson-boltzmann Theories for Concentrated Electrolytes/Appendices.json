In steric-modified PB formulations for concentrated electrolytes, such as the Bikerman–Fermi approach, the ion size parameters $v_i$ quantify the effective excluded volume per particle (including hydration) and thereby regularize the predicted local ion density.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of physical chemistry and computational electrochemistry, well-posed with a clear path to a unique solution, and objective in its language. All necessary data are provided, and the constraints are consistent and physically plausible within the context of an idealized model. The problem requires a multi-step, non-trivial application of fundamental definitions and relations, making it a substantive exercise. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the sequence of tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we convert the given molality, $m$, to molarity, $C$. We consider a basis of $1~\\mathrm{kg}$ of the solvent, water.\nThe mass of water is $m_{\\mathrm{w}} = 1~\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe given molality is $m = 0.80~\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$.\nThe number of moles of solute ($\\mathrm{KCl}$) in this control mass is $n_{\\mathrm{KCl}} = m \\times m_{\\mathrm{w}} = 0.80~\\mathrm{mol}$.\nThe molar mass of $\\mathrm{KCl}$ is $M_{\\mathrm{KCl}} = 74.5513~\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, which is equivalent to $0.0745513~\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\nThe mass of the solute is $m_{\\mathrm{KCl}} = n_{\\mathrm{KCl}} \\times M_{\\mathrm{KCl}} = 0.80~\\mathrm{mol} \\times 0.0745513~\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 0.05964104~\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe total mass of the solution is the sum of the mass of the solvent and the mass of the solute:\n$m_{\\mathrm{sol}} = m_{\\mathrm{w}} + m_{\\mathrm{KCl}} = 1~\\mathrm{kg} + 0.05964104~\\mathrm{kg} = 1.05964104~\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe density of the solution is given as $\\rho = 1.020~\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. We convert this to SI units:\n$\\rho = 1.020~\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{3}} \\times \\frac{10^{-3}~\\mathrm{kg}}{1~\\mathrm{g}} \\times \\left(\\frac{100~\\mathrm{cm}}{1~\\mathrm{m}}\\right)^{3} = 1.020 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10^{6}~\\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m}^{3}} = 1020~\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$.\nThe total volume of the solution is $V_{\\mathrm{sol}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{sol}}}{\\rho} = \\frac{1.05964104~\\mathrm{kg}}{1020~\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}} \\approx 1.03886 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\nThe molarity, $C$, is the number of moles of solute per unit volume of solution, expressed in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$:\n$$C = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{KCl}}}{V_{\\mathrm{sol}}} = \\frac{0.80~\\mathrm{mol}}{1.03886 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}} \\approx 770.076~\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n\nSecond, we infer the solute volume fraction, $\\phi$, from the viscosity data using the leading-order hydrodynamic relation, which is the Einstein viscosity equation for dilute suspensions of hard spheres:\n$$\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{w}}} = 1 + \\frac{5}{2}\\phi$$\nwhere $\\eta = 1.02~\\mathrm{mPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$ is the solution viscosity and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{w}} = 0.890~\\mathrm{mPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$ is the pure water viscosity. Rearranging for $\\phi$:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{2}{5}\\left(\\frac{\\eta}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{w}}} - 1\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{2}{5}\\left(\\frac{1.02}{0.890} - 1\\right) \\approx \\frac{2}{5}(1.146067 - 1) = \\frac{2}{5}(0.146067) \\approx 0.058427$$\n\nThird, we relate the total solute volume fraction $\\phi$ to the individual ion size parameters $v_{+}$ for $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $v_{-}$ for $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. The total volume fraction is the sum of the volume fractions of the constituent ions, $\\phi = \\phi_{+} + \\phi_{-}$. The volume fraction of an ion species $i$ is the product of its number density $n_i$ and its effective volume $v_i$.\n$$\\phi = n_{+} v_{+} + n_{-} v_{-}$$\nFor a $1{:}1$ electrolyte like $\\mathrm{KCl}$, the salt dissociates completely, so the number densities of the cation and anion are equal to the number density of the salt, $n_{\\text{salt}}$.\n$n_{+} = n_{-} = n_{\\text{salt}}$.\nThe number density is related to the molarity $C$ and Avogadro's constant $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n$n_{\\text{salt}} = C N_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\phi$:\n$$\\phi = C N_{\\mathrm{A}} v_{+} + C N_{\\mathrm{A}} v_{-} = C N_{\\mathrm{A}} (v_{+} + v_{-})$$\nThis gives us a relationship for the sum of the ionic volumes:\n$$v_{+} + v_{-} = \\frac{\\phi}{C N_{\\mathrm{A}}}$$\nUsing the calculated values for $\\phi$ and $C$, and the given value for $N_{\\mathrm{A}} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}~\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$:\n$$v_{+} + v_{-} = \\frac{0.058427}{(770.076~\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}~\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})} \\approx \\frac{0.058427}{4.6375 \\times 10^{26}~\\mathrm{m}^{-3}} \\approx 1.2599 \\times 10^{-28}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\n\nFourth, we close the system of equations using the given hydrated radius ratio, $r = a_{+}/a_{-} = 0.90$. The ion volume is related to its radius by $v_i = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a_i^3$. The ratio of the volumes is therefore:\n$$\\frac{v_{+}}{v_{-}} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a_{+}^{3}}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi a_{-}^{3}} = \\left(\\frac{a_{+}}{a_{-}}\\right)^{3} = r^{3}$$\nSubstituting the value of $r$:\n$$v_{+} = r^{3} v_{-} = (0.90)^{3} v_{-} = 0.729 v_{-}$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $v_{+}$ and $v_{-}$:\n1.  $v_{+} + v_{-} = 1.2599 \\times 10^{-28}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n2.  $v_{+} = 0.729 v_{-}$\n\nSubstitute equation (2) into equation (1):\n$$0.729 v_{-} + v_{-} = 1.2599 \\times 10^{-28}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\n$$(1.729) v_{-} = 1.2599 \\times 10^{-28}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\n$$v_{-} = \\frac{1.2599 \\times 10^{-28}}{1.729}~\\mathrm{m}^{3} \\approx 7.287 \\times 10^{-29}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\nNow, solve for $v_{+}$ using equation (2):\n$$v_{+} = 0.729 \\times (7.287 \\times 10^{-29}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}) \\approx 5.312 \\times 10^{-29}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$$\nRounding the results to three significant figures as requested:\n$v_{+} \\approx 5.31 \\times 10^{-29}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n$v_{-} \\approx 7.29 \\times 10^{-29}~\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n\nFinally, we explain the physical significance of these parameters. The values $v_i$ represent the effective excluded volume per ion, which is a crucial parameter in modified Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) theories. The classical PB theory treats ions as point charges, an idealization that breaks down at high concentrations by predicting unphysically infinite ion densities near charged surfaces. Modified theories, such as the Bikerman–Fermi model, introduce steric repulsion to prevent this by considering the finite size of ions.\nThe connection between $v_i$ and the hydrated ionic radii $a_i$ is explicitly given by the hard-sphere volume formula, $v_i = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi a_i^3$. This relation models each ion (e.g., $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ or $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) and its tightly bound hydration shell as an incompressible sphere of radius $a_i$. The volume $v_i$ is thus the physical space occupied by one hydrated ion, into which the center of another ion cannot penetrate.\nIn the statistical mechanical framework of modified PB theories, this excluded volume $v_i$ is used to place an upper bound on the local concentration of ions. For example, in a lattice-gas formulation, the total available volume is finite, and the maximum local number density of species $i$ is limited to $n_{i, \\text{max}} = 1/v_i$. This regularization corrects the primary flaw of classical PB theory, ensuring that ion concentrations remain physically realistic even under strong electrostatic potentials. By deriving $v_i$ from macroscopic transport data (viscosity), we obtain values that are grounded in the hydrodynamic behavior of the hydrated ions, providing a self-consistent and physically meaningful parameterization for steric exclusion in continuum models of concentrated electrolytes.",

In the bulk, the concentrations are $c_+^{\\infty} = c_-^{\\infty} = c_0$, so the bulk volume fraction is $\\Phi^{\\infty} = v(c_0 + c_0) = 2vc_0$.\n\nThus, we have the equilibrium condition $\\bar{\\mu}_i(\\phi) = \\bar{\\mu}_i(\\text{bulk})$:\n$$\n\\mu_i^{\\circ} + k_B T \\ln(c_i(\\phi)) - k_B T \\ln(1 - \\Phi(\\phi)) + z_i e \\phi = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + k_B T \\ln(c_i^{\\infty}) - k_B T \\ln(1 - \\Phi^{\\infty})\n$$\nWe use $c_+^{\\infty}=c_0$ and $c_-^{\\infty}=c_0$.

Solve this boundary-value problem in the semi-infinite domain $x>0$ to obtain $ \\phi(x)$ and the mobile charge density $ \\rho(x)$ as functions of $x$. Define the cumulative mobile charge from the wall up to position $x$ by $ q(x) = \\int_{0}^{x} \\rho(x') \\, dx'$, and analyze its sign as a function of distance.\n\nIntroduce the dimensionless parameter $ \\delta = \\kappa \\, l_c$, where $ \\kappa$ is the Debye screening parameter defined via the linear response of a symmetric electrolyte. Determine the regime of $ \\delta$ in which the cumulative mobile charge $ q(x)$ exhibits sign changes with $x$ (i.e., “charge inversion” due to overscreening), and provide the exact threshold value $ \\delta_c$ separating monotonic screening from oscillatory overscreening. Express the final threshold $ \\delta_c$ as a dimensionless number. No rounding is required.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Equation and Boundary Conditions\n\nThe BSK model modifies the classical electrostatic laws to account for short-range correlations. The constitutive relation between the generalized displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ and the electric field $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\phi$ is given as $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon(1 - l_c^2 \\nabla^2)\\mathbf{E}$. In one dimension ($x$), this becomes $D_x = -\\epsilon(1 - l_c^2 \\frac{d^2}{dx^2})\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$.\n\nGauss's law relates the divergence of the displacement field to the free charge density, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho$. In one dimension, this is $\\frac{dD_x}{dx} = \\rho(x)$. Substituting the expression for $D_x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ -\\epsilon \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} - l_c^2 \\frac{d^3\\phi}{dx^3}\\right) \\right] = \\rho(x)\n$$\n$$\n-\\epsilon \\left(\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} - l_c^2 \\frac{d^4\\phi}{dx^4}\\right) = \\rho(x)\n$$\nFor a symmetric $z:z$ electrolyte with bulk concentration $n_b$, the mobile charge density $\\rho(x)$ is given by $\\rho(x) = ze(n_+(x) - n_-(x))$, where $n_+$ and $n_-$ are the cation and anion number densities. Using the linearized Boltzmann distribution for small potential ($|ze\\phi| \\ll k_B T$):\n$$\nn_{\\pm}(x) \\approx n_b(1 \\mp \\frac{ze\\phi(x)}{k_B T})\n$$\nSo, the charge density is:\n$$\n\\rho(x) \\approx ze \\left( n_b(1 - \\frac{ze\\phi}{k_B T}) - n_b(1 + \\frac{ze\\phi}{k_B T}) \\right) = -\\frac{2n_b(ze)^2}{k_B T} \\phi(x)\n$$\nThis can be written as $\\rho(x) = -\\epsilon \\kappa^2 \\phi(x)$, where $\\kappa$ is the inverse Debye length, defined by:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{2n_b(ze)^2}{\\epsilon k_B T}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho(x)$ into the modified Poisson equation yields:\n$$\n-\\epsilon \\left(\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} - l_c^2 \\frac{d^4\\phi}{dx^4}\\right) = -\\epsilon \\kappa^2 \\phi(x)\n$$\nRearranging gives the governing fourth-order linear ordinary differential equation for $\\phi(x)$:\n$$\nl_c^2 \\frac{d^4\\phi}{dx^4} - \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} + \\kappa^2 \\phi = 0\n$$\nThe problem is defined on the semi-infinite domain $x>0$. We require the potential and its derivatives to vanish far from the wall:\n1.  $\\phi(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe natural boundary conditions at the wall $x=0$ are derived from the variational principle associated with the BSK free energy. The first condition comes from Gauss's law at the charged surface: $D_x(0) = \\sigma$.\n2.  $-\\epsilon \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} - l_c^2 \\frac{d^3\\phi}{dx^3}\\right)\\bigg|_{x=0} = \\sigma$.\n\nThe second condition at the wall, for a simple blocking electrode with no specific surface-ion interactions that would constrain the potential's curvature, is the vanishing of the higher-order stress term. This \"natural\" boundary condition is:\n3.  $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0$.\n\n### Solution of the Boundary-Value Problem\n\nTo solve the ODE, we consider its characteristic equation, obtained by substituting $\\phi(x) = e^{rx}$:\n$$ l_c^2 r^4 - r^2 + \\kappa^2 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $s=r^2$:\n$$ l_c^2 s^2 - s + \\kappa^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions for $s$ are:\n$$ s = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4l_c^2\\kappa^2}}{2l_c^2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4\\delta^2}}{2l_c^2} $$\nwhere $\\delta = \\kappa l_c$ is the dimensionless parameter. The four roots for $r$ are $r = \\pm\\sqrt{s}$. For the solution to be physically meaningful (decaying at infinity), we only consider roots with a negative real part.\n\nLet the two such roots be $-k_a$ and $-k_b$. The general solution that decays as $x \\to \\infty$ is:\n$$ \\phi(x) = C_1 e^{-k_a x} + C_2 e^{-k_b x} $$\nwhere $k_a$ and $k_b$ have positive real parts. Applying the boundary conditions at $x=0$:\nFrom $\\phi''(0) = 0$:\n$$ C_1 k_a^2 e^{-k_a x}|_{x=0} + C_2 k_b^2 e^{-k_b x}|_{x=0} = 0 \\implies C_1 k_a^2 + C_2 k_b^2 = 0 $$\nThis gives the relation $C_2 = -C_1(k_a^2/k_b^2)$.\n\nFrom the surface charge condition, it can be shown that $\\phi'(x) - l_c^2\\phi'''(x) = -\\frac{\\kappa^2}{k}e^{-kx}$ for a single mode $e^{-kx}$. Thus, for the linear combination, at $x=0$:\n$$ -\\epsilon \\left( -C_1\\frac{\\kappa^2}{k_a} - C_2\\frac{\\kappa^2}{k_b} \\right) = \\sigma \\implies C_1\\frac{1}{k_a} + C_2\\frac{1}{k_b} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon\\kappa^2} $$\nSubstituting $C_2 = -C_1(k_a/k_b)^2$:\n$$ C_1\\left(\\frac{1}{k_a} - \\frac{k_a^2}{k_b^2}\\frac{1}{k_b}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon\\kappa^2} \\implies C_1 \\frac{k_b^3-k_a^3}{k_a k_b^3} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon\\kappa^2} $$\nSolving for $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon\\kappa^2} \\frac{k_a k_b^3}{k_b^3-k_a^3}, \\quad C_2 = -\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon\\kappa^2} \\frac{k_a^3 k_b}{k_b^3-k_a^3} $$\nThe solution for the potential is:\n$$ \\phi(x) = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon\\kappa^2(k_a^3-k_b^3)} \\left(k_a^3 k_b e^{-k_b x} - k_a k_b^3 e^{-k_a x}\\right) $$\nThe mobile charge density is $\\rho(x) = -\\epsilon\\kappa^2\\phi(x)$:\n$$ \\rho(x) = -\\frac{\\sigma}{k_a^3-k_b^3} \\left(k_a^3 k_b e^{-k_b x} - k_a k_b^3 e^{-k_a x}\\right) $$\nwhere we define $k_a$ and $k_b$ to be the roots of $l_c^2 r^4 - r^2 + \\kappa^2 = 0$ with positive real parts.\n\n### Analysis of Cumulative Charge and Overscreening Threshold\n\nThe cumulative mobile charge is $q(x) = \\int_0^x \\rho(x')dx'$. An equivalent expression is $q(x) = D_x(x) - D_x(0) = D_x(x) - \\sigma$.\nFor charge inversion to occur, $q(x)$ must change sign. Since $\\sigma>0$, the initial charge accumulation must be negative, so $q(x)$ must become positive for some $x>0$.\n\nThe problem equates the regime of charge inversion with \"oscillatory overscreening\" and asks for the threshold $\\delta_c$ separating this from \"monotonic screening\". This directs our analysis to the nature of the roots of the characteristic equation, which is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = 1 - 4\\delta^2$.\n\n-   **Case 1: Monotonic Screening ($\\Delta > 0 \\implies \\delta < 1/2$)**\n    The roots $s_{1,2}$ for $r^2$ are real, distinct, and positive. This leads to two distinct real decay constants $k_a$ and $k_b$. The potential $\\phi(x)$ is a sum of two real exponential decays. This form of decay is non-oscillatory, corresponding to what the problem calls \"monotonic screening\".\n\n-   **Case 2: Oscillatory Overscreening ($\\Delta < 0 \\implies \\delta > 1/2$)**\n    The roots $s_{1,2}$ for $r^2$ are a complex conjugate pair. This means the roots $r$ are of the form $\\pm\\lambda_+ \\pm i\\lambda_-$, where $\\lambda_+$ and $\\lambda_-$ are real and positive. The decaying solution for $\\phi(x)$ takes the form of a damped sinusoid:\n    $$ \\phi(x) = A e^{-\\lambda_+ x} \\cos(\\lambda_- x + \\alpha) $$\n    where $A$ and $\\alpha$ are constants. This is an oscillatory potential profile. This is the regime of \"oscillatory overscreening\".\n\n-   **Case 3: Critical Point ($\\Delta = 0 \\implies \\delta = 1/2$)**\n    The roots for $r^2$ are repeated, $s_1=s_2=1/(2l_c^2)$. The roots for $r$ are $\\pm k$ where $k=1/(\\sqrt{2}l_c)$, and each is a double root. The solution involves terms like $(C_1+C_2x)e^{-kx}$, which represents critical damping and is non-oscillatory.\n\nThe problem asks for the threshold $\\delta_c$ that separates the monotonic screening regime from the oscillatory overscreening regime. This transition occurs precisely when the discriminant of the characteristic equation changes sign, i.e., when it is zero.\n$$ \\Delta = 1 - 4\\delta_c^2 = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\delta_c$ (which must be positive), we find:\n$$ \\delta_c^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies \\delta_c = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nBased on the problem's framing, which equates charge inversion with oscillatory overscreening, this transition point is the threshold for charge inversion. Therefore, charge inversion occurs for $\\delta > 1/2$. The threshold value is $1/2$.",
