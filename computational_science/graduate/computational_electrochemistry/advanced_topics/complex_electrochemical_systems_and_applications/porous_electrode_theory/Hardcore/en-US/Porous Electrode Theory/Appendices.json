            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state continuity equation for the electrolyte phase in a porous electrode, based on John Newman's porous electrode theory, and a subsequent numerical calculation.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Continuity Equation\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental law of local charge conservation for the electrolyte phase. Within the volume occupied by the electrolyte, the charge continuity equation is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho_e'}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{i}_e' = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_e'(\\mathbf{x},t)$ is the local microscopic charge density (in $\\text{C}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$) and $\\mathbf{i}_e'(\\mathbf{x},t)$ is the local microscopic current density (in $\\text{A}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$) at a point $\\mathbf{x}$ within the electrolyte phase. This equation states that any local accumulation of charge must be balanced by a net flow of charge into that point. It holds true only within the boundaries of the electrolyte phase.\n\nTo obtain a macroscopic equation applicable to the entire porous electrode volume (which includes both the solid and electrolyte phases), we perform a volume averaging procedure over a Representative Elementary Volume (REV), denoted by $V$. The resulting macroscopic quantities are continuous fields defined over the entire domain of the porous electrode.\n\nThe superficial average of a quantity $\\psi$ defined in the electrolyte phase is given by $\\langle \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{V} \\int_{V_e} \\psi \\, dV$, where $V_e$ is the volume of the electrolyte within the REV. The macroscopic electrolyte current density, $\\mathbf{i}_e$, is defined as the superficial average of the microscopic current density:\n$$\n\\mathbf{i}_e = \\langle \\mathbf{i}_e' \\rangle = \\frac{1}{V} \\int_{V_e} \\mathbf{i}_e' \\, dV\n$$\nAveraging the local conservation equation over the REV requires the use of the spatial averaging theorem (also known as the divergence theorem for porous media), which relates the average of a divergence to the divergence of the average:\n$$\n\\langle \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{i}_e' \\rangle = \\nabla \\cdot \\langle \\mathbf{i}_e' \\rangle + \\frac{1}{V} \\int_{S_{int}} \\mathbf{i}_e' \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{es} \\, dS\n$$\nHere, $S_{int}$ is the total area of the solid-electrolyte interface within the REV, and $\\mathbf{n}_{es}$ is the unit normal vector pointing from the electrolyte phase into the solid phase. The integral term represents the total flux of charge from the electrolyte to the solid across the interface, per unit volume of the porous electrode.\n\nThe problem defines the interfacial current density, $j$, as the charge transfer *from* the solid phase *into* the electrolyte phase. If we define $\\mathbf{n}_{se}$ as the unit normal vector pointing from the solid to the electrolyte ($\\mathbf{n}_{se} = -\\mathbf{n}_{es}$), then $j$ corresponds to the component of current density along this direction: $j = \\mathbf{i}_e' \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{se}$.\nTherefore, the integrand can be rewritten in terms of $j$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{i}_e' \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{es} = \\mathbf{i}_e' \\cdot (-\\mathbf{n}_{se}) = -j\n$$\nThe integral term thus becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{V} \\int_{S_{int}} (-j) \\, dS = -\\frac{S_{int}}{V} \\frac{1}{S_{int}} \\int_{S_{int}} j \\, dS = - a_s \\bar{j}\n$$\nwhere $a_s = S_{int}/V$ is the specific interfacial area (interfacial area per unit electrode volume) and $\\bar{j}$ is the average interfacial current density over $S_{int}$. Assuming $j$ is uniform over the interface within the REV, we have $\\bar{j} = j$. The spatial averaging theorem then yields:\n$$\n\\langle \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{i}_e' \\rangle = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{i}_e - a_s j\n$$\nNow, we average the time derivative term from the local conservation equation:\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{\\partial \\rho_e'}{\\partial t} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{\\partial \\langle \\rho_e' \\rangle}{\\partial t}\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\rho_e' \\rangle = \\frac{1}{V} \\int_{V_e} \\rho_e' \\, dV$ is the volume-averaged charge density.\n\nCombining these averaged terms, the macroscopic charge conservation equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\langle \\rho_e' \\rangle}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{i}_e - a_s j = 0\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{i}_e = a_s j - \\frac{\\partial \\langle \\rho_e' \\rangle}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThe problem specifies several conditions to simplify this equation to its steady-state form:\n1.  **Electroneutrality in the electrolyte phase**: This assumption posits that the net charge density in the bulk electrolyte is zero, i.e., $\\rho_e' = 0$. Consequently, the averaged charge density $\\langle \\rho_e' \\rangle$ is also zero. This is a common and simplifying assumption in electrochemical modeling.\n2.  **Negligible double-layer charging**: The term $\\frac{\\partial \\langle \\rho_e' \\rangle}{\\partial t}$ physically represents the capacitive current associated with changes in the charge stored in the electrical double layer at the solid-electrolyte interface. The assumption that this effect is negligible means we set this term to zero.\n3.  **Steady-state form**: In steady state, by definition, all time derivatives of state variables are zero. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial \\langle \\rho_e' \\rangle}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n\nAll three of these conditions, which are explicitly stated or implied, lead to the elimination of the time derivative term. The final steady-state continuity equation is thus:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{i}_e = a_s j\n$$\nThis fundamental equation of porous electrode theory states that the change in electrolyte current through a differential volume element is exactly equal to the amount of current produced by electrochemical reactions at the interface within that volume.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Calculation\n\nThe problem asks to compute the volumetric interfacial current, which is given by the product $a_s j$.\nThe given values are:\n- Specific interfacial area, $a_s = 2 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$.\n- Local interfacial current density, $j = 1\\,\\text{A}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}$.\n\nThe volumetric interfacial current is calculated as:\n$$\na_s j = (2 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) \\times (1\\,\\text{A}\\,\\text{m}^{-2})\n$$\n$$\na_s j = 2 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{A}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed with three significant figures.

We are also asked to state any consistency requirements for such a steady state to exist.\n\nWe begin with the general species conservation equation for the salt in the electrolyte, within the framework of porous electrode theory. For a one-dimensional domain $0 \\le x \\le L$, this equation is:\n$$\n\\varepsilon \\frac{\\partial c_e}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial N_e}{\\partial x} + s_e\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon$ is the constant porosity, $c_e(x,t)$ is the salt concentration, $N_e(x,t)$ is the molar flux of the salt, and $s_e$ is the volumetric source term for the salt due to electrochemical reactions.\n\nThe problem specifies a steady state, which means all time derivatives are zero. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial c_e}{\\partial t} = 0$. The conservation equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_e}{dx} = s_e\n$$\n\nThe salt flux, $N_e$, in a binary electrolyte is driven by diffusion and migration.

For a simple 1:1 electrolyte (e.g., LiCl, where $\\nu_-=1$ and $z_-=-1$), which is standard for such problems unless specified otherwise, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nN_e(x) = -D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dc_e}{dx} + \\frac{i_e(x)(1-t_+^0)}{F}\n$$\nwhere $D_{\\text{eff}}$ is the constant effective diffusivity, $i_e(x)$ is the current density in the electrolyte phase, and $F$ is Faraday's constant.\n\nThe source term for the salt, $s_e$, is related to the interfacial reaction current density, $j(x)$. For a 1:1 electrolyte, this relation is:\n$$\ns_e = a_s j(x) \\frac{1-t_+^0}{F}\n$$\nwhere $a_s$ is the uniform specific interfacial area. The problem states that $j(x) = J_0$, a constant. Therefore, the source term is also constant:\n$$\ns_e = \\frac{a_s J_0 (1-t_+^0)}{F}\n$$\n\nThe electrolyte current density $i_e(x)$ is related to the reaction current density $j(x)$ through charge conservation, $\\frac{di_e}{dx} = a_s j(x)$.

To determine $C_1$, we must establish a boundary condition for $i_e(x)$. In a typical porous electrode configuration, the domain $0 \\le x \\le L$ is bounded by a separator and a current collector.

With $P=0$, the concentration profile must be uniform: $c_e(x) = Q$.\n\nNow, applying the boundary condition at $x=0$ with $P=0$:\n$$\nN_e(0) = -D_{\\text{eff}}(0) + \\frac{a_s J_0(0-L)(1-t_+^0)}{F} = -\\frac{a_s J_0 L (1-t_+^0)}{F} = 0\n$$\nThis equation reveals the consistency requirement for a steady state to exist under the given conditions. For physical parameters $a_s \\neq 0$, $L \\neq 0$, and universal constant $F \\neq 0$, we must have:\n$$\nJ_0 (1-t_+^0) = 0\n$$\nThis means a steady state is only possible if either the reaction current density is zero ($J_0=0$) or the cation transference number is unity ($t_+^0=1$). This is the explicit consistency requirement asked for in the problem. This physical constraint arises because a uniform reaction ($J_0 \\neq 0$) in a closed domain ($N_e(0)=N_e(L)=0$) implies a continuous net production or consumption of salt, which makes a steady state impossible unless the salt generation term itself is zero (which occurs if $t_+^0=1$).\n\nAssuming this consistency requirement is met, we have established that the steady-state concentration profile must be uniform, $c_e(x) = Q$. To find the constant $Q$, we invoke conservation of the total amount of salt. If the consistency requirement holds, there is no net production or consumption of salt in the entire domain. Therefore, the total amount of salt in the electrolyte at steady state must be equal to the total amount of salt present initially.\nThe initial total moles of salt is:\n$$\nM_{salt, \\text{initial}} = \\int_0^L \\varepsilon A c_e(x,0) dx = \\int_0^L \\varepsilon A c_{e,0} dx = \\varepsilon A c_{e,0} L\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the electrode.\nThe final total moles of salt at steady state is:\n$$\nM_{salt, \\text{final}} = \\int_0^L \\varepsilon A c_e(x) dx = \\int_0^L \\varepsilon A Q dx = \\varepsilon A Q L\n$$\nEquating the initial and final amounts:\n$$\n\\varepsilon A c_{e,0} L = \\varepsilon A Q L \\implies Q = c_{e,0}\n$$\nTherefore, the steady-state salt concentration profile is uniform and equal to the initial concentration.\n\nFinal solution: The consistency requirement for a steady-state solution to exist is $J_0(1-t_+^0)=0$. Under this condition, the governing equation and boundary conditions lead to a uniform concentration profile. By conservation of mass, this uniform concentration must be equal to the initial uniform concentration, $c_{e,0}$.",
