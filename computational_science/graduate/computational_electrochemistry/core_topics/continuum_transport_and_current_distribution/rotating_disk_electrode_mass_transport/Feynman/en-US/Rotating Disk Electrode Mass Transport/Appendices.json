            "problem": "You are given a scenario in computational electrochemistry concerning a Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE). The task is to compute the limiting current $i_L$ for mass-transport-limited reduction of a dilute species using a physically consistent, steady-state, convective-diffusion framework for flow over a rotating disk. The computational model must be based on the standard similarity boundary layer approach and the high Schmidt number regime, starting from the steady advection-diffusion equation and using boundary layer scaling to obtain the mass transfer coefficient. Assume the reaction is fast enough that the concentration at the electrode surface is negligibly small compared to the bulk concentration. You must apply the following physical constants and units:\n\n- Faraday constant $F = 96485 \\ \\mathrm{C/mol}$.\n- Diffusion coefficient $D$ in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n- Kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n- Angular rotation rate $\\omega$ in $\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- Number of electrons transferred $n$ (dimensionless).\n- Electrode area $A$ in $\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n- Bulk concentration $c_\\infty$ in $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$.\n- The output limiting current $i_L$ must be in $\\mathrm{A}$.\n\nStarting from the steady-state species balance with convection and diffusion, and using the boundary layer similarity analysis appropriate for the Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE), derive the expression for the mass transfer coefficient consistent with the high Schmidt number limit and use it to compute $i_L$ numerically. Then, perform a sensitivity analysis to quantify the local, relative sensitivity of $i_L$ with respect to each parameter $D$, $\\nu$, $\\omega$, $n$, $A$, and $c_\\infty$. For each parameter $p$, define the dimensionless local sensitivity $S_p$ at the provided operating point as\n$$\nS_p \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln i_L}{\\partial \\ln p} \\approx \\frac{i_L(p(1+\\epsilon)) - i_L(p(1-\\epsilon))}{2 \\epsilon \\, i_L(p)},\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a small, dimensionless perturbation. Use a single value of $\\epsilon$ that is sufficiently small to capture local behavior but not so small as to be dominated by numerical roundoff. Treat $n$ as a continuous parameter for the purpose of sensitivity analysis.\n\nYour program must compute, for each test case, the limiting current $i_L$ in $\\mathrm{A}$ and the ordered list of sensitivities $[S_D, S_\\nu, S_\\omega, S_n, S_A, S_{c_\\infty}]$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the limiting current $i_L$ at a Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) and a subsequent numerical sensitivity analysis of $i_L$ with respect to its physical parameters. The solution is derived from the principles of convective mass transport in the high Schmidt number limit.\n\n**Theoretical Foundation: The Levich Equation**\n\nThe physical scenario involves an electrochemical reaction at the surface of a rotating disk, where the rate is limited by the transport of the reactant species from the bulk solution to the electrode surface. The governing equation is the steady-state convective-diffusion equation. Under the assumption of a uniformly accessible disk and a high Schmidt number ($Sc = \\nu/D \\gg 1$), this simplifies to a one-dimensional problem balancing convection in the direction normal to the disk ($z$-axis) and diffusion along the same axis:\n$v_z \\frac{dc}{dz} = D \\frac{d^2c}{dz^2}$\nwhere $c$ is the molar concentration of the reactant, $D$ is its diffusion coefficient, and $v_z$ is the axial fluid velocity. Hydrodynamic analysis of the flow field near the rotating disk (the von Kármán solution) gives the axial velocity component for small $z$ as:\n$$ v_z \\approx -0.51023 \\, \\omega^{3/2} \\nu^{-1/2} z^2 $$\nHere, $\\omega$ is the angular rotation rate in $\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nThe boundary conditions for a mass-transport-limited process are:\n1.  $c = 0$ at the electrode surface ($z=0$), as the reaction is assumed to be infinitely fast.\n2.  $c = c_\\infty$ far from the electrode ($z \\to \\infty$), where $c_\\infty$ is the bulk concentration.\n\nSolving this differential equation with the specified boundary conditions yields the concentration gradient at the electrode surface. The molar flux, $J$, is then found using Fick's first law, $J = -D (dc/dz)_{z=0}$. The solution to this system gives the flux as:\n$$ J = 0.62048 \\, D^{2/3} \\nu^{-1/6} \\omega^{1/2} c_\\infty $$\nThe total limiting current, $i_L$, is the flux multiplied by the number of electrons transferred per molecule, $n$, the Faraday constant, $F$, and the electrode area, $A$. This yields the celebrated Levich equation, which will be used for the calculations. Using the standard numerical prefactor, the formula is:\n$$ i_L = 0.620 \\, n \\, F \\, A \\, D^{2/3} \\, \\nu^{-1/6} \\, \\omega^{1/2} \\, c_\\infty $$\nAll parameters are specified in base SI units ($m, s, C, mol, rad$), ensuring the resulting current $i_L$ is in Amperes ($A = C/s$).\n\n**Numerical Sensitivity Analysis**\n\nThe problem defines the dimensionless local sensitivity, $S_p$, of the limiting current $i_L$ with respect to a parameter $p$ as:\n$$ S_p = \\frac{\\partial \\ln i_L}{\\partial \\ln p} $$\nThis quantity measures the percentage change in $i_L$ for a one percent change in $p$. We are instructed to compute this numerically using a central finite difference approximation:\n$$ S_p \\approx \\frac{i_L(p(1+\\epsilon)) - i_L(p(1-\\epsilon))}{2 \\epsilon \\, i_L(p)} $$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a small, dimensionless perturbation. A value of $\\epsilon=10^{-6}$ is chosen, which is sufficiently small for accuracy while avoiding numerical instability from floating-point precision limits. For each parameter $p \\in \\{D, \\nu, \\omega, n, A, c_\\infty\\}$, this formula is applied by calculating $i_L$ at the baseline value of $p$ and at the perturbed values $p(1 \\pm \\epsilon)$, while keeping all other parameters constant.\n\n**Computational Algorithm**\n\nThe implementation will consist of the following steps for each test case:\n1.  Define a function that takes the set of six parameters ($D, \\nu, \\omega, n, A, c_\\infty$) and the constant $F$ as input and returns the limiting current $i_L$ calculated using the Levich equation.\n2.  For a given test case, compute the baseline limiting current, $i_{L,0}$.\n3.  For each of the six parameters, in turn:\n    a. Calculate $i_L$ for the parameter value perturbed by $(1+\\epsilon)$.\n    b. Calculate $i_L$ for the parameter value perturbed by $(1-\\epsilon)$.\n    c. Compute the sensitivity $S_p$ using the finite difference formula.\n4.  Collect the results for each test case into a list of the form $[i_{L,0}, S_D, S_\\nu, S_\\omega, S_n, S_A, S_{c_\\infty}]$.\n5.  Format the final output as a single-line string representing a list of these result lists, ensuring no extraneous whitespace is present, as per an exact output specification. The sensitivities are analytically known to be constant values ($S_D = 2/3$, $S_\\nu = -1/6$, $S_\\omega = 1/2$, and $S_n=S_A=S_{c_\\infty}=1$), and the numerical computation should yield results very close to these theoretical values.",

It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of mass transport to a rotating disk electrode, is well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of data and constraints for a meaningful solution. The task is to determine the diffusion coefficient $D$ and its relative uncertainty from experimental data, which is a standard procedure in physical electrochemistry.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main stages: first, the derivation of the governing physical equation relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable quantities; second, the formulation of the statistical method for parameter estimation and uncertainty propagation; and third, the application of this methodology to the provided test cases.\n\n**1. Theoretical Foundation: The Levich Equation**\n\nThe mass transport of an electroactive species to the surface of a rotating disk electrode (RDE) under steady-state, laminar flow conditions is described by the convective-diffusion equation. For a transport-limited reaction, where the concentration of the reactant at the electrode surface is effectively zero, the resulting limiting current $i_L$ is given by the Levich equation:\n\n$$\ni_L = 0.620 n F A D^{2/3} \\nu^{-1/6} c_\\infty \\omega^{1/2}\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $i_L$ is the limiting current in Amperes ($A$).\n- $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the electrode reaction.\n- $F$ is the Faraday constant, $96485\\,\\mathrm{C/mol}$.\n- $A$ is the electrode area in $\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n- $D$ is the diffusion coefficient of the electroactive species in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n- $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the solution in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$.\n- $c_\\infty$ is the bulk concentration of the species in $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$.\n- $\\omega$ is the angular rotation rate of the electrode in $\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n\nThe Levich equation predicts a linear relationship between the limiting current $i_L$ and the square root of the angular rotation rate, $\\omega^{1/2}$. We can write this relation in the form of a linear equation, $y = sx + b$:\n\n$$\ni_L = s \\cdot \\omega^{1/2} + b\n$$\n\nHere, $y = i_L$ and $x = \\omega^{1/2}$. The theoretical slope, $s$, is given by:\n\n$$\ns = 0.620 n F A c_\\infty D^{2/3} \\nu^{-1/6}\n$$\n\nThe intercept, $b$, is theoretically zero but is retained in the regression model to account for any background currents or instrumental offsets, which is a sound experimental practice.\n\nTo determine the diffusion coefficient $D$ from the experimentally measured slope, we rearrange the equation for the slope. Let $\\hat{s}$ be the estimated slope from a linear regression of $i_L$ versus $\\omega^{1/2}$. The estimated diffusion coefficient, $\\hat{D}$, can be expressed by isolating $D$:\n\n$$\n\\hat{D}^{2/3} = \\frac{\\hat{s}}{0.620 n F A c_\\infty \\nu^{-1/6}} = \\frac{\\hat{s} \\nu^{1/6}}{0.620 n F A c_\\infty}\n$$\n\nRaising both sides to the power of $3/2$ yields the final expression for $\\hat{D}$:\n\n$$\n\\hat{D} = \\left( \\frac{\\hat{s} \\nu^{1/6}}{0.620 n F A c_\\infty} \\right)^{3/2} = \\left( \\frac{\\hat{s}}{0.620 n F A c_\\infty} \\right)^{3/2} \\nu^{1/4}\n$$\n\nThis equation forms the basis for calculating the diffusion coefficient from the estimated slope of the Levich plot.\n\n**2. Statistical Analysis and Uncertainty Propagation**\n\nThe experimental data consist of pairs of $(\\omega_i, i_{L,i})$. We first transform the independent variable to $x_i = \\omega_i^{1/2}$ and perform an ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression of $y_i = i_{L,i}$ on $x_i$. This procedure yields an estimate for the slope, $\\hat{s}$, and its standard uncertainty, $u_s$.\n\nThe next step is to propagate the uncertainties from the input quantities to the final calculated value of $\\hat{D}$. The problem states that the quantities with uncertainty are the estimated slope $\\hat{s}$, the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$, and the bulk concentration $c_\\infty$. Their respective standard uncertainties are $u_s$, $u_\\nu$, and $u_{c_\\infty}$. We assume these quantities are mutually independent.\n\nThe propagation of uncertainty is based on a first-order Taylor series expansion of the function for $\\hat{D}$. For a function $f(z_1, z_2, ..., z_k)$ where the variables $z_i$ are independent, the squared standard uncertainty of the result, $u_f^2$, is given by:\n\n$$\nu_f^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z_i} \\right)^2 u_{z_i}^2\n$$\n\nThe function for our diffusion coefficient is $\\hat{D} = f(\\hat{s}, \\nu, c_\\infty)$.

Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe algorithm is executed for each of the four test cases provided.\n\n1.  **Data Preparation**: For a given set of angular speeds $\\omega$ and limiting currents $i_L$, the regressor variable $x = \\omega^{1/2}$ is computed.\n2.  **Linear Regression**: An OLS linear regression of $i_L$ versus $x$ is performed to find the estimated slope $\\hat{s}$ and its standard uncertainty $u_s$.\n3.  **Diffusion Coefficient Calculation**: The estimated diffusion coefficient $\\hat{D}$ is calculated using the derived formula:\n    $$\n    \\hat{D} = \\left( \\frac{\\hat{s}}{0.620 n F A c_\\infty} \\right)^{3/2} \\nu^{1/4}\n    $$\n4.  **Uncertainty Calculation**: The relative standard uncertainty $u_{\\mathrm{rel},D}$ is calculated using the derived propagation formula, substituting the values of $\\hat{s}$, $u_s$, $\\nu$, $u_\\nu$, $c_\\infty$, and $u_{c_\\infty}$.\n5.  **Formatting**: The calculated value of $\\hat{D}$ is rounded and formatted to six significant figures, and $u_{\\mathrm{rel},D}$ is rounded and formatted to four significant figures.

            "problem": "You are tasked with implementing and verifying a second-order accurate numerical scheme for estimating the normal concentration gradient at a rotating disk electrode surface to compute the diffusive flux. The context is steady-state mass transport in a Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE), governed by the convection–diffusion balance near the disk. The verification must be performed against the Levich analytic limiting flux for diffusion-limited conditions.\n\nBegin from the following foundational base:\n- The one-dimensional steady convection–diffusion equation normal to the disk takes the form $u_z(z)\\,\\partial c/\\partial z = D\\,\\partial^2 c/\\partial z^2$ under axisymmetric, steady conditions, where $z$ is the coordinate normal to the disk surface pointing into the electrolyte, $c(z)$ is the concentration of the reacting species, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $u_z(z)$ is the axial velocity induced by the hydrodynamic flow above the rotating disk.\n- Under diffusion-limited reaction, the boundary conditions are $c(0) = 0$ and $c(z) \\to c^\\ast$ as $z \\to \\infty$, where $c^\\ast$ is the bulk concentration.\n- The Levich correlation for the limiting mass-transfer coefficient for a Rotating Disk Electrode is $k_L = 0.62\\,D^{2/3}\\,\\nu^{-1/6}\\,\\omega^{1/2}$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity and $\\omega$ is the angular rotation rate. The corresponding limiting diffusive flux magnitude is $|J_L| = k_L\\,c^\\ast$ with units of $\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nYou will implement a second-order accurate one-sided finite difference approximation to estimate $-\\partial c/\\partial z\\big|_{z=0}$ from discrete values of $c(z)$ at grid points $z_0=0$, $z_1=h$, and $z_2=2h$. The scheme to be implemented is\n$$\n-\\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z}\\right|_{z=0} \\approx \\frac{3c(z_0) - 4c(z_1) + c(z_2)}{2h},\n$$\nwhich has a truncation error of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ under sufficient smoothness of $c(z)$.\n\nTo make the verification self-contained and focus purely on the numerical accuracy of the derivative scheme, use the manufactured solution\n$$\nc(z) = c^\\ast\\left(1 - e^{-\\alpha z}\\right),\n$$\nwhere the decay rate $\\alpha$ is chosen such that the exact surface flux magnitude matches the Levich analytic value.

The final output, however, must consist of the observed orders of accuracy $p$ (dimensionless) for the four test cases.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the four results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, in the order of the test cases A, B, C, D (e.g., `[p_A,p_B,p_C,p_D]`).",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of electrochemical mass transport and numerical analysis, specifically the method of manufactured solutions for code verification. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters, equations, and boundary conditions provided to ensure a unique, deterministic solution. The setup is internally consistent, objective, and computationally feasible.\n\nThe task is to verify the convergence order of a second-order accurate finite difference scheme for the concentration gradient at the surface of a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The verification will be performed against an analytical solution by computing the observed order of accuracy for successively refined computational grids.\n\nThe core of the methodology is the Method of Manufactured Solutions. Instead of numerically solving the full convection-diffusion equation, which would introduce its own discretization errors, we use a pre-defined, analytical function for the concentration profile, $c(z)$, that is designed to satisfy the problem's boundary conditions and produce a known surface flux. This allows for the isolation and assessment of the error stemming solely from the finite difference approximation of the gradient.\n\nFirst, we define the key analytical quantities based on the provided parameters for each test case: the diffusion coefficient ($D$), kinematic viscosity ($\\nu$), angular rotation rate ($\\omega$), and bulk concentration ($c^\\ast$).\n\nThe Levich equation provides the mass-transfer coefficient, $k_L$, under diffusion-limited conditions:\n$$\nk_L = 0.62\\,D^{2/3}\\,\\nu^{-1/6}\\,\\omega^{1/2}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the corresponding exact, limiting diffusive flux at the electrode surface ($z=0$) is given by:\n$$\n|J_L| = k_L\\,c^\\ast\n$$\nThis quantity, $|J_L|$, serves as the exact reference value against which our numerical approximation will be compared.\n\nNext, we employ the specified manufactured solution for the concentration profile:\n$$\nc(z) = c^\\ast\\left(1 - e^{-\\alpha z}\\right)\n$$\nThis function correctly satisfies the boundary conditions: $c(0) = c^\\ast(1-e^0) = 0$ and $c(z) \\to c^\\ast$ as $z \\to \\infty$. To ensure the manufactured solution is consistent with the RDE physics being modeled, the decay parameter $\\alpha$ is chosen such that the analytical flux derived from $c(z)$ exactly matches the Levich flux, $|J_L|$. The flux is defined by Fick's first law, $J = -D\\,\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z}$. The gradient of the manufactured solution is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left[ c^\\ast\\left(1 - e^{-\\alpha z}\\right) \\right] = c^\\ast \\alpha e^{-\\alpha z}\n$$\nAt the surface ($z=0$), the gradient is $\\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z}\\right|_{z=0} = c^\\ast \\alpha$. The magnitude of the exact flux is therefore:\n$$\n|J| = \\left|-D \\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z}\\right|_{z=0}\\right| = D c^\\ast \\alpha\n$$\nBy setting this equal to the Levich flux, $|J_L| = k_L c^\\ast$, we find the required value for $\\alpha$:\n$$\nD c^\\ast \\alpha = k_L c^\\ast \\implies \\alpha = \\frac{k_L}{D}\n$$\nThis ensures that the manufactured solution has the correct physical properties at the boundary. The characteristic length scale of the concentration boundary layer, $\\delta_m$, is the inverse of this decay rate: $\\delta_m = 1/\\alpha = D/k_L$.\n\nWe now turn to the numerical approximation of the flux. The problem provides a second-order accurate, one-sided finite difference formula for the negative of the gradient at the surface:\n$$\n-\\left.\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z}\\right|_{z=0} \\approx \\frac{3c(z_0) - 4c(z_1) + c(z_2)}{2h}\n$$\nwhere $z_0=0$, $z_1=h$, and $z_2=2h$. We evaluate $c(z)$ at these points using our manufactured solution:\n$c(z_0) = c(0) = c^\\ast(1 - e^0) = 0$, $c(z_1) = c(h) = c^\\ast(1 - e^{-\\alpha h})$, and $c(z_2) = c(2h) = c^\\ast(1 - e^{-2\\alpha h})$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula yields the numerical approximation for the negative gradient:\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z}\\right)_{\\text{approx}} = \\frac{3(0) - 4c^\\ast(1 - e^{-\\alpha h}) + c^\\ast(1 - e^{-2\\alpha h})}{2h} = \\frac{c^\\ast(-3 + 4e^{-\\alpha h} - e^{-2\\alpha h})}{2h}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the numerical flux, $|J_{\\text{num}}|$, is $D$ times the magnitude of the approximated gradient:\n$$\n|J_{\\text{num}}| = \\left|-D \\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z}\\right)_{\\text{approx}}\\right| = D \\left|-\\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z}\\right)_{\\text{approx}}\\right| = D \\left| \\frac{c^\\ast(-3 + 4e^{-\\alpha h} - e^{-2\\alpha h})}{2h} \\right|\n$$\nSince for small positive $h$, the term $e^{-\\alpha h} \\approx 1-\\alpha h$, the numerator is approximately $c^\\ast(-3 + 4(1-\\alpha h) - (1-2\\alpha h)) = c^\\ast(-2\\alpha h)$, which is negative. Thus, we take the absolute value:\n$$\n|J_{\\text{num}}| = D \\left( \\frac{c^\\ast(3 - 4e^{-\\alpha h} + e^{-2\\alpha h})}{2h} \\right)\n$$\nTo verify the order of accuracy, we compute $|J_{\\text{num},i}|$ for three successively refined grid spacings: $h_1 = \\delta_m/200$, $h_2 = \\delta_m/400 = h_1/2$, and $h_3 = \\delta_m/800 = h_2/2$. For each grid spacing $h_i$, the relative error $e_i$ is calculated:\n$$\ne_i = \\frac{\\left||J_{\\text{num},i}| - |J_L|\\right|}{|J_L|}\n$$\nThe theoretical error for a numerical method of order $p$ behaves as $e \\approx C h^p$ for some constant $C$. Given two error measurements $e_1$ and $e_2$ corresponding to grid spacings $h_1$ and $h_2$, the order $p$ can be estimated by:\n$$\n\\frac{e_1}{e_2} \\approx \\frac{C h_1^p}{C h_2^p} = \\left(\\frac{h_1}{h_2}\\right)^p \\implies p = \\frac{\\ln(e_1/e_2)}{\\ln(h_1/h_2)}\n$$\nWe compute two such estimates, $p_{12}$ from $(h_1, h_2)$ and $p_{23}$ from $(h_2, h_3)$. Since our grid refinement factor is constant ($h_i/h_{i+1} = 2$), the formulas are:\n$$\np_{12} = \\frac{\\ln(e_1/e_2)}{\\ln(2)}, \\quad p_{23} = \\frac{\\ln(e_2/e_3)}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThe final reported order of accuracy, $p$, is the average of these two estimates:\n$$\np = \\frac{p_{12} + p_{23}}{2}\n$$\nFor a second-order accurate scheme as specified, the value of $p$ is expected to be very close to $2$. The algorithm proceeds by applying this entire calculation to each of the four test cases provided.",
