Integrating the equation twice yields a linear concentration profile:\n$$\nc(y) = \\frac{c_b}{H} y\n$$\nThe molar flux at the electrode surface ($y=0$) is given by Fick's first law:\n$$\nN_s = \\left| -D \\left. \\frac{dc}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} \\right| = \\left| -D \\left( \\frac{c_b}{H} \\right) \\right| = \\frac{D c_b}{H}\n$$\nBy definition, $N_s = k_{m,\\mathrm{stagnant}} c_b$. Comparing these two expressions for $N_s$, we find the mass transfer coefficient for the stagnant case:\n$$\nk_{m,\\mathrm{stagnant}} = \\frac{D}{H}\n$$\n\n**Case 2: Forced convection**\nIn this case, we use the provided empirical correlation for the Sherwood number, $\\mathrm{Sh}$. The mass transfer coefficient, $k_{m,\\mathrm{forced}}$, is obtained from the definition of the Sherwood number:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sh} = \\frac{k_{m,\\mathrm{forced}} D_h}{D} \\quad \\implies \\quad k_{m,\\mathrm{forced}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Sh} \\cdot D}{D_h}\n$$\nThe provided correlation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sh} = 1.85 \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Sc}\\,D_{h}}{L}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the values of the dimensionless numbers using the given parameters:\n$H = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$, $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\,\\text{m}$, $u = 5.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$, $\\rho = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$, $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}$, and $D = 1.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe hydraulic diameter is given as $D_h = 2H$:\n$$\nD_h = 2 \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}\n$$\nThe Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho u D_h}{\\mu}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = 100\n$$\nThe Schmidt number, $\\mathrm{Sc} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho D}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sc} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{(1.0 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-9})} = \\frac{10^{-3}}{1.2 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{1000}{1.2} = \\frac{2500}{3}\n$$\nNow, we compute the dimensionless group within the Sherwood correlation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Sc}\\,D_h}{L} = \\frac{(100) \\left(\\frac{2500}{3}\\right) (2.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-1}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-1} \\times \\frac{2500}{3}}{10^{-1}} = 2 \\times \\frac{2500}{3} = \\frac{5000}{3}\n$$\nSubstitute this value into the expression for $\\mathrm{Sh}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Sh} = 1.85 \\left(\\frac{5000}{3}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThe mass transfer coefficient for the forced convection case is:\n$$\nk_{m,\\mathrm{forced}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Sh} \\cdot D}{D_h} = \\frac{1.85 \\left(\\frac{5000}{3}\\right)^{1/3} D}{2H}\n$$\n\n**Ratio Calculation**\nNow we can compute the ratio $\\frac{k_{m,\\mathrm{forced}}}{k_{m,\\mathrm{stagnant}}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{m,\\mathrm{forced}}}{k_{m,\\mathrm{stagnant}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1.85 D}{2H} \\left(\\frac{5000}{3}\\right)^{1/3}}{\\frac{D}{H}} = \\frac{1.85}{2} \\left(\\frac{5000}{3}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis expression can also be derived symbolically:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{m,\\mathrm{forced}}}{k_{m,\\mathrm{stagnant}}} = \\frac{\\frac{D}{2H} \\cdot 1.85 \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Sc}\\, (2H)}{L}\\right)^{1/3}}{\\frac{D}{H}} = \\frac{1.85}{2} \\left(\\frac{2 H \\cdot \\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Sc}}{L}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{2\\rho u H}{\\mu}$ and $\\mathrm{Sc} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho D}$ gives $\\mathrm{Re}\\,\\mathrm{Sc} = \\frac{2uH}{D}$.\n$$\n\\frac{k_{m,\\mathrm{forced}}}{k_{m,\\mathrm{stagnant}}} = \\frac{1.85}{2} \\left(\\frac{2H}{L} \\cdot \\frac{2uH}{D}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{1.85}{2} \\left(\\frac{4uH^2}{LD}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{4uH^2}{LD}$ evaluates to $\\frac{5000}{3}$, confirming our initial numerical path.\nNow, we compute the final value:\n$$\n\\frac{j_{L,\\mathrm{forced}}}{j_{L,\\mathrm{stagnant}}} = 0.925 \\times \\left(\\frac{5000}{3}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 0.925 \\times (1666.666...)^{1/3}\n$$\n$$\n\\approx 0.925 \\times 11.8563505 \\approx 10.9671242\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $10.97$.",
