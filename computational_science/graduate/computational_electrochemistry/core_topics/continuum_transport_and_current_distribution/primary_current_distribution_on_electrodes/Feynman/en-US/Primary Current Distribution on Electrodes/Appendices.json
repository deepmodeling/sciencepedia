The governing equation is $\\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\kappa \\nabla \\phi\\right) = 0$ for the electrolyte potential $\\phi(x,y)$, where the current density is $\\mathbf{j} = -\\kappa \\nabla \\phi$. An electrode at $x=0$ imposes a specified potential $\\phi = \\phi_e$ (Dirichlet boundary), and the opposite wall at $x = L_x$ is insulating, i.e., $j_n = 0$ (Neumann boundary). The boundaries at $y=0$ and $y=L_y$ are also insulating. You aim to construct a resistor-network approximation by discretizing the domain into a uniform structured grid with spacings $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$, placing nodes at cell centers $(i,j)$, and connecting adjacent nodes with resistors so that Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) holds at each internal node.\n\nStarting from the conservation statement $\\int_{\\Omega_{ij}} \\nabla \\cdot \\left(\\kappa \\nabla \\phi\\right)\\, dA = 0$ over a rectangular control volume $\\Omega_{ij}$ of area $\\Delta x \\Delta y$, use first principles to justify how the continuous conductivity $\\kappa$ maps to discrete inter-nodal conductances $G$ in the resistor network such that the resulting discrete currents $I = G\\,(\\phi_{\\text{left}} - \\phi_{\\text{right}})$ across faces are consistent with the face fluxes $-\\kappa \\,\\partial \\phi/\\partial n$ integrated over the face area $A_{\\text{face}} = b \\times$ (face length).

            "solution": "The problem statement is a standard exercise in the finite volume discretization of an elliptic partial differential equation with variable coefficients and mixed boundary conditions. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the discrete conductances $G$ for a resistor network that approximates the continuous equation $\\nabla \\cdot (\\kappa \\nabla \\phi) = 0$ on a cell-centered grid. The derivation starts from the integral conservation law over a control volume $\\Omega_{ij}$ centered at a node $(i,j)$. The control volume is a rectangle of size $\\Delta x \\times \\Delta y$.\n\nThe integral form of the governing equation is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_{ij}} \\nabla \\cdot (\\kappa \\nabla \\phi) \\, dA = 0\n$$\nApplying the divergence theorem, we convert the area integral of the divergence into a line integral of the flux over the boundary $\\partial \\Omega_{ij}$ of the control volume. The current density is $\\mathbf{j} = -\\kappa \\nabla \\phi$, so the conservation of charge (which is what $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0$ represents in steady state) implies that the net current flowing out of the control volume is zero.\n$$\n\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega_{ij}} \\mathbf{j} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, ds = \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega_{ij}} (-\\kappa \\nabla \\phi) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\, ds = 0\n$$\nThis is Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) for the control volume. The integral can be broken down into the sum of currents through the four faces of the rectangular control volume (east, west, north, south):\n$$\nI_{\\text{east}} + I_{\\text{west}} + I_{\\text{north}} + I_{\\text{south}} = 0\n$$\nHere, each term represents the total current leaving the control volume through that face. Let's analyze the current $I_{i+1/2, j}$ flowing from node $(i,j)$ to node $(i+1,j)$ through the face at $x_{i+1/2} = x_i + \\Delta x/2$. The area of this face is $A_{\\text{face}} = b \\Delta y$. The current is given by integrating the normal component of the current density over the face area.\n$$\nI_{i+1/2, j} = \\int_{\\text{face}} j_x \\, dS = \\int_{y_j-\\Delta y/2}^{y_j+\\Delta y/2} \\left(-\\kappa \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x_{i+1/2}} (b \\, dy)\n$$\nAssuming the integrand is approximately constant over the face, we get:\n$$\nI_{i+1/2, j} \\approx \\left(-\\kappa \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x_{i+1/2}, y_j} (b \\Delta y)\n$$\nThe potential gradient at the face is approximated using a central difference between the adjacent node potentials $\\phi_{i,j}$ and $\\phi_{i+1,j}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\right)_{x_{i+1/2}, y_j} \\approx \\frac{\\phi_{i+1,j} - \\phi_{i,j}}{\\Delta x}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the current:\n$$\nI_{i+1/2, j} \\approx - \\kappa_{i+1/2,j} \\frac{\\phi_{i+1,j} - \\phi_{i,j}}{\\Delta x} (b \\Delta y) = \\kappa_{i+1/2,j} \\frac{b \\Delta y}{\\Delta x} (\\phi_{i,j} - \\phi_{i+1,j})\n$$\nThe problem defines the discrete current as $I = G(\\phi_{\\text{left}} - \\phi_{\\text{right}})$. Comparing forms, we find the inter-nodal conductance is $G_{i+1/2, j} = \\kappa_{i+1/2,j} \\frac{b \\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$. The main task is to determine the effective conductivity at the interface, $\\kappa_{i+1/2,j}$.\n\n**Interior Conductance:**\nTo ensure flux continuity, the current density must be continuous across the interface between two cells. The total potential drop from node $i$ to node $i+1$ is the sum of the potential drops over the two half-cells. This is equivalent to two resistors in series. The resistance of a block of material is $R = \\frac{\\text{length}}{\\kappa \\times \\text{Area}}$.\nThe resistance of the left half-cell (from $x_i$ to $x_{i+1/2}$) is $R_{\\text{left}} = \\frac{\\Delta x / 2}{\\kappa_{i,j} (b \\Delta y)}$.\nThe resistance of the right half-cell (from $x_{i+1/2}$ to $x_{i+1}$) is $R_{\\text{right}} = \\frac{\\Delta x / 2}{\\kappa_{i+1,j} (b \\Delta y)}$.\nThe total resistance between nodes $(i,j)$ and $(i+1,j)$ is $R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{left}} + R_{\\text{right}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2 b \\Delta y} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\kappa_{i,j}} + \\frac{1}{\\kappa_{i+1,j}} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2 b \\Delta y} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa_{i,j} + \\kappa_{i+1,j}}{\\kappa_{i,j} \\kappa_{i+1,j}} \\right)\n$$\nThe conductance $G_{i+1/2,j}$ is the reciprocal of the total resistance:\n$$\nG_{i+1/2,j} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{2 b \\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa_{i,j} \\kappa_{i+1,j}}{\\kappa_{i,j} + \\kappa_{i+1,j}} \\right) = \\frac{b \\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\left( \\frac{2 \\kappa_{i,j} \\kappa_{i+1,j}}{\\kappa_{i,j} + \\kappa_{i+1,j}} \\right)\n$$\nThis shows that the effective conductivity $\\kappa_{i+1/2,j}$ is the harmonic mean of the conductivities of the adjacent cells. A similar derivation for the $y$-direction yields $G_{i,j+1/2} = \\frac{b \\Delta x}{\\Delta y} \\left( \\frac{2 \\kappa_{i,j} \\kappa_{i,j+1}}{\\kappa_{i,j} + \\kappa_{i,j+1}} \\right)$.\n\n**Dirichlet Boundary at $x=0$:**\nThe boundary is at $x=0$ with a specified potential $\\phi = \\phi_e$. The first column of cell centers is at $x_1 = \\Delta x / 2$. We need to find the conductance $G_{\\text{b},j}$ between the boundary and the node $(1,j)$. The physical distance is just that of one half-cell, $\\Delta x / 2$. The resistance of this segment is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{boundary}} = \\frac{\\text{distance}}{\\kappa \\times \\text{Area}} = \\frac{\\Delta x / 2}{\\kappa_{1,j} (b \\Delta y)}\n$$\nThe conductance is the reciprocal:\n$$\nG_{\\text{b},j} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{boundary}}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{1,j} b \\Delta y}{\\Delta x / 2} = \\frac{2 b \\Delta y \\kappa_{1,j}}{\\Delta x}\n$$\n\n**Neumann Boundary at $x=L_x$:**\nThe boundary condition is insulating, meaning the normal component of the current density is zero: $j_n = j_x = 0$. The total current flowing out of the domain through the face of a boundary cell $(N_x, j)$ at $x=L_x$ is therefore zero. In the resistor network analogy, a zero current between two points is achieved by having an infinite resistance, which corresponds to a zero conductance. Thus, the node $(N_x, j)$ should have no outward connection in the $x$-direction.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A.** The interior conductance formula, $G_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} = \\dfrac{b\\,\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\,\\dfrac{\\kappa_{i,j} + \\kappa_{i+1,j}}{2}$, uses the arithmetic mean of conductivity. This is incorrect for ensuring current continuity; the harmonic mean is required. While the boundary treatments are correctly described, the failure on the interior formula makes the option incorrect. **Incorrect.**\n\n**B.** The interior conductance formula, $G_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} = \\dfrac{b\\,\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\,\\dfrac{2\\,\\kappa_{i,j}\\,\\kappa_{i+1,j}}{\\kappa_{i,j} + \\kappa_{i+1,j}}$, correctly uses the harmonic mean. The Dirichlet boundary conductance, $G_{\\text{b},j} = \\dfrac{2\\,b\\,\\Delta y\\,\\kappa_{1,j}}{\\Delta x}$, correctly accounts for the half-cell distance $\\Delta x/2$. The Neumann boundary treatment, \"do not connect $(N_x,j)$ outward so that the outward current is zero\", is the correct network representation of an insulating boundary. All parts are consistent with the derivation from first principles. **Correct.**\n\n**C.** The interior conductance formula, $G_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} = \\dfrac{b\\,\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\,\\sqrt{\\kappa_{i,j}\\,\\kappa_{i+1,j}}$, uses the geometric mean. This is incorrect. The Dirichlet boundary conductance, $G_{\\text{b},j} = \\dfrac{b\\,\\Delta y\\,\\kappa_{1,j}}{\\Delta x}$, is incorrect as it uses the full cell width $\\Delta x$ instead of the half-cell width $\\Delta x/2$. The Neumann boundary treatment involving a ghost node is a valid numerical technique, but describing it as a connection via a \"large but finite conductance\" is peculiar and less direct than simply having no connection ($G=0$). The option is incorrect on multiple grounds. **Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option correctly identifies the harmonic mean for interior conductance. However, its formula for the Dirichlet boundary conductance, $G_{\\text{b},j} = \\dfrac{b\\,\\Delta y\\,\\kappa_{1,j}}{\\Delta x}$, is incorrect for the same reason as in Option C (it fails to use the half-cell distance $\\Delta x/2$). The proposed Neumann boundary treatment, adding a \"negative conductance,\" is physically nonsensical and computationally unstable. Negative resistance/conductance implies a source of energy, not an insulating wall. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, only Option B provides the correct set of rules for constructing the conservative, physically faithful resistor-network approximation.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a rigorous numerical verification of the convergence order for a finite difference (or equivalent resistor-network) approximation of the Laplace equation governing the primary current distribution in a rectangular electrolytic cell. We will first outline the methodology for discretizing the governing equation, constructing the corresponding linear system, and then compute the error against the provided analytical solution to determine the observed order of accuracy.\n\nThe physical system is an electrolyte in a rectangular domain $\\Omega = \\{(x,y)\\,|\\, 0 \\le x \\le L_x,\\, 0 \\le y \\le L_y\\}$. The primary current distribution assumes a uniform electrolyte conductivity, negligible activation overpotentials, and no concentration gradients. Under these assumptions, the conservation of charge, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0$, combined with Ohm's law, $\\mathbf{j} = -\\sigma \\nabla\\phi$ (where $\\sigma$ is the constant conductivity), leads to the governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the electric potential $\\phi(x,y)$, which is Laplace's equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = 0\n$$\nThe potential field is subject to the specified Dirichlet boundary conditions:\n$$\n\\phi(x,0) = 0,\\quad \\phi(x,L_y) = \\sin(\\pi x/L_x),\\quad \\phi(0,y)=0,\\quad \\phi(L_x,y)=0\n$$\n\nTo solve this PDE numerically, we discretize the domain $\\Omega$ using a grid with $N_x$ points in the $x$-direction and $N_y$ points in the $y$-direction.

All other entries of $\\mathbf{b}$ are zero. The resulting matrix $A$ is sparse, symmetric, positive-definite, and diagonally dominant, ensuring a unique solution for $\\mathbf{\\Phi}$, which can be found using a standard linear solver.\n\nOnce the numerical solution $\\phi_{i,j}$ is obtained at all interior nodes, we compute the error by comparing it to the exact analytical solution evaluated at the same nodes:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\text{exact}}(x_i,y_j) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x_i}{L_x}\\right)\\frac{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\pi y_j}{L_x}\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\pi L_y}{L_x}\\right)}\n$$\nThe error is quantified using the infinity norm over the set of interior nodes:\n$$\ne_{\\infty} = \\max_{1 \\le i \\le N_x-2}\\,\\max_{1 \\le j \\le N_y-2}\\, |\\phi_{i,j} - \\phi_{\\text{exact}}(x_i,y_j)|\n$$\nFinally, to verify the second-order accuracy of the scheme, we compute the observed order of accuracy, $p$, using the errors from two different grid resolutions, one coarse and one fine:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\ln(e_{\\infty}^{(\\text{coarse})} / e_{\\infty}^{(\\text{fine})})}{\\ln(h_{\\text{coarse}} / h_{\\text{fine}})}\n$$\nwhere $h = \\max(h_x, h_y)$ is the representative grid spacing. For a second-order scheme where the grid spacing is halved ($h_{\\text{coarse}} / h_{\\text{fine}} = 2$), the error is expected to decrease by a factor of four, yielding an observed order $p \\approx \\log_2(4) = 2$. The computational task is to calculate $p$ for the three specified test cases.",

This exercise moves beyond idealized boundary conditions to incorporate a linear contact resistance at the electrode interface, a common feature in real systems.

            "problem": "Consider a planar electrode at $x=0$ immersed in a uniform electrolyte slab of thickness $L$ with constant ionic conductivity $\\kappa$ and cross-sectional area $A$. The electrode metal potential is uniform and denoted by $\\phi_m$, and the electrolyte potential is $\\phi(x)$. Assume the Primary Current Distribution regime, in which the electrolyte obeys steady conduction with negligible concentration gradients and negligible activation overpotential. The electrolyte potential satisfies the Laplace equation derived from charge conservation and Ohm's law, and the interface admits a linear contact resistance described by a Robin boundary condition. Measurements provide pairs of total current $I$ and metal-to-reference potential difference $\\Delta \\phi$ where the reference is at $x=L$. The task is to deduce and calibrate the interfacial contact resistivity parameter that appears in the Robin boundary condition by fitting measured $I$–$\\Delta \\phi$ data and systematically isolating electrolyte versus interfacial contributions.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental base:\n- Charge conservation (steady state): $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0$.\n- Ohm’s law for ionic conduction: $\\mathbf{j} = -\\kappa \\nabla \\phi$ where $\\kappa$ is constant in space.\n- Robin boundary condition (linear interfacial contact model): the normal ionic current density at the electrode equals an interfacial term that linearly relates the metal potential $\\phi_m$ and the electrolyte potential at the surface $\\phi_s$, parameterized by a contact resistivity $r_c$ with units of $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nYou must:\n1. Derive, from first principles and the base above, the relationship between the measurable quantities $I$ and $\\Delta \\phi$, explicitly identifying the separate contributions due to the electrolyte path and the interfacial contact resistivity. Do not assume any shortcut formulas; derive the governing equations and the resulting relationship by solving the one-dimensional electrolyte domain and applying the boundary conditions.\n2. Using your derived relationship, design a computational protocol to estimate the interfacial contact resistivity $r_c$ from multiple measurements with known $(L,\\kappa,A)$ and observed $(I,\\Delta \\phi)$. Your protocol must explicitly isolate the electrolyte contribution from the interfacial contribution. The protocol should be robust to small measurement noise and should employ linear least squares to fit the appropriate transformed variables, ensuring a unique estimate of $r_c$.\n3. Implement the protocol as a complete, runnable program that processes the following test suite of three cases. In each case, use the provided measurements to estimate $r_c$ in $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2$. Express the final outputs as floats in scientific notation with six significant digits. The angle unit is not applicable. No percentages are involved; all ratio-type outputs should be decimal numbers.\n\nTest Suite (all quantities in SI units):\n- Case $1$ (happy path, moderate electrolyte contribution):\n  - Geometry and material: $L = 0.005$, $\\kappa = 10$, $A = 4 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n  - Measured pairs $(I,\\Delta \\phi)$: $I$ values $\\left[0.5, 1.0, 1.5\\right]$ and corresponding $\\Delta \\phi$ values $\\left[0.6854375, 1.3805, 2.058375\\right]$.\n- Case $2$ (boundary where electrolyte contribution is small relative to contact resistance):\n  - Geometry and material: $L = 0.001$, $\\kappa = 1000$, $A = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$.\n  - Measured pairs $(I,\\Delta \\phi)$: $I$ values $\\left[2.0, 5.0, 10.0\\right]$ and corresponding $\\Delta \\phi$ values $\\left[0.2222, 0.5456, 1.1055\\right]$.\n- Case $3$ (edge case dominated by electrolyte resistance):\n  - Geometry and material: $L = 0.001$, $\\kappa = 1$, $A = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n  - Measured pairs $(I,\\Delta \\phi)$: $I$ values $\\left[0.05, 0.1\\right]$ and corresponding $\\Delta \\phi$ values $\\left[5.049, 10.3224\\right]$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each entry being the calibrated $r_c$ in $\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2$ formatted in scientific notation with six significant digits.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electrochemistry, mathematically well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of information for derivation and computation. The task is to derive a relationship for a primary current distribution model and use it to calibrate an interfacial parameter from provided data.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the governing physical relationship from first principles, and second, the design of a computational protocol to estimate the model parameter.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Current-Potential Relationship\n\nWe consider a one-dimensional system where the electrode is at position $x=0$ and the electrolyte extends to $x=L$. The potential in the electrolyte is denoted by $\\phi(x)$, and the current density vector $\\mathbf{j}$ is directed along the $x$-axis, i.e., $\\mathbf{j} = j_x \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$.\n\n1.  **Charge Conservation and Ohm's Law**: The steady-state charge conservation equation is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0$. In one dimension, this simplifies to $\\frac{d j_x}{dx} = 0$, which implies that the current density $j_x$ is constant throughout the electrolyte. Let us denote this constant current density as $j$.\n\n    Ohm's law for ionic conduction states that $\\mathbf{j} = -\\kappa \\nabla \\phi$, where $\\kappa$ is the constant ionic conductivity. In one dimension, this is $j_x = -\\kappa \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$.\n\n    Combining these two principles, we have a first-order ordinary differential equation for the electrolyte potential $\\phi(x)$:\n    $$\n    -\\kappa \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = j\n    $$\n    Since $j$ and $\\kappa$ are constants, we can integrate this equation with respect to $x$ from the electrode surface at $x=0$ to the reference probe position at $x=L$. Let $\\phi_s = \\phi(0)$ be the electrolyte potential at the interface and $\\phi_r = \\phi(L)$ be the potential at the reference position.\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\phi_s}^{\\phi_r} d\\phi = \\int_{0}^{L} -\\frac{j}{\\kappa} dx\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\phi_r - \\phi_s = -\\frac{jL}{\\kappa}\n    $$\n    This equation describes the ohmic potential drop across the bulk electrolyte. Rearranging it gives:\n    $$\n    \\phi_s - \\phi_r = \\frac{jL}{\\kappa}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Interfacial Boundary Condition**: The problem specifies a Robin boundary condition modeling a linear contact resistance at the electrode-electrolyte interface ($x=0$). The normal ionic current density, $j$, is proportional to the potential difference between the metal phase, $\\phi_m$, and the electrolyte at the surface, $\\phi_s$. The proportionality constant is the inverse of the interfacial contact resistivity, $r_c$.\n    $$\n    j = \\frac{\\phi_m - \\phi_s}{r_c}\n    $$\n    This gives the potential drop across the interface:\n    $$\n    \\phi_m - \\phi_s = j r_c\n    $$\n    The units are consistent: $j$ is in $\\text{A}/\\text{m}^2$, $\\phi$ is in $\\text{V}$, and $r_c$ must be in $\\text{V}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{A}$, which is $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}^2$.\n\n3.  **Total Measurable Potential Difference**: The experimentally measured quantity is the potential difference between the metal electrode and the reference electrode, $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_m - \\phi_r$. We can express this by summing the individual potential drops across the interface and the electrolyte:\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\phi = (\\phi_m - \\phi_s) + (\\phi_s - \\phi_r)\n    $$\n    Substituting the expressions derived above:\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\phi = j r_c + \\frac{jL}{\\kappa}\n    $$\n    The total current $I$ flowing through the system is the current density $j$ multiplied by the cross-sectional area $A$, so $j = I/A$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\Delta \\phi$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{I}{A} r_c + \\frac{I L}{A \\kappa}\n    $$\n    Factoring out the total current $I$, we obtain the final relationship between the measurable quantities:\n    $$\n    \\Delta \\phi = I \\left( \\frac{r_c}{A} + \\frac{L}{\\kappa A} \\right)\n    $$\n    This equation shows that the total measured resistance, $R_{total} = \\Delta \\phi / I$, is the sum of two components: the interfacial contact resistance $R_c = r_c/A$ and the bulk electrolyte resistance $R_{elyt} = L/(\\kappa A)$.\n    $$\n    R_{total} = R_c + R_{elyt}\n    $$\n\n### Part 2: Computational Protocol for Parameter Estimation\n\nThe goal is to estimate the interfacial contact resistivity $r_c$ from a series of $N$ measurement pairs $(I_i, \\Delta \\phi_i)$ given the known parameters $L$, $\\kappa$, and $A$.\n\n1.  **Linear Model Formulation**: The derived relationship $\\Delta \\phi = I \\left( \\frac{r_c}{A} + \\frac{L}{\\kappa A} \\right)$ has the form of a linear equation passing through the origin, $y = m x$, where the dependent variable is $y_i = \\Delta \\phi_i$, the independent variable is $x_i = I_i$, and the slope is the constant total resistance $m = R_{total} = \\frac{r_c}{A} + \\frac{L}{\\kappa A}$.\n\n2.  **Least-Squares Estimation**: To obtain a robust estimate of $R_{total}$ from data that may contain small measurement noise, we employ the method of linear least squares. For a linear model without an intercept, $y=mx$, the slope $m$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, $\\sum (y_i - m x_i)^2$, is given by:\n    $$\n    \\hat{m} = \\hat{R}_{total} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2}\n    $$\n    In our context, this becomes:\n    $$\n    \\hat{R}_{total} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i \\Delta \\phi_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i^2}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Isolation of Interfacial Resistivity**: Once the best-fit total resistance $\\hat{R}_{total}$ is computed from the measurement data, we can determine $r_c$ by systematically isolating the known electrolyte contribution.\n\n    a.  First, calculate the theoretical resistance of the electrolyte slab using the given parameters:\n        $$\n        R_{elyt} = \\frac{L}{\\kappa A}\n        $$\n\n    b.  Next, subtract this electrolyte resistance from the estimated total resistance to find the estimated contact resistance, $\\hat{R}_c$:\n        $$\n        \\hat{R}_c = \\hat{R}_{total} - R_{elyt}\n        $$\n\n    c.  Finally, the interfacial contact resistivity $\\hat{r}_c$ is obtained by multiplying the contact resistance by the electrode area $A$:\n        $$\n        \\hat{r}_c = \\hat{R}_c \\cdot A\n        $$\n\n4.  **Final Estimation Formula**: Combining these steps yields a single comprehensive formula for the estimation of $r_c$:\n    $$\n    \\hat{r}_c = \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i \\Delta \\phi_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} I_i^2} - \\frac{L}{\\kappa A} \\right) \\cdot A\n    $$\n    This protocol provides a direct and robust method to compute $\\hat{r}_c$ using all available measurements, fulfilling the requirements of the problem.",
