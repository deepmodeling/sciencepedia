The physical basis is the piecewise linearity of the exact ground-state total energy in Density Functional Theory (DFT) with respect to electron number. The exact total energy for a system with integer electron number $N$ and one fractional electron $f \\in [0,1]$ is given by a linear interpolation between the integer electron energies, so that the exact $E(N+f)$ varies linearly between $E(N)$ and $E(N+1)$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Density Functional Theory (DFT), specifically concerning the behavior of approximate exchange-correlation functionals for systems with fractional electron numbers. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters, definitions, and equations provided to arrive at a unique, deterministic solution. The language is objective and the tasks are computationally feasible.\n\nThe physical-chemical principle underpinning this problem is the piecewise linearity of the exact ground-state total energy, $E$, as a function of the number of electrons, $N$. For a system with a non-integer number of electrons $N+f$, where $N$ is an integer and $f \\in [0,1]$ is the fractional part, the exact energy is a linear interpolation between the energies of the integer-electron systems:\n$$\nE_{\\text{exact}}(N+f) = (1-f)E(N) + fE(N+1) = E(N) + f(E(N+1) - E(N))\n$$\nMany common approximate density functionals, particularly semi-local ones like the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, violate this condition. They typically exhibit a spurious convex curvature (downward bowing), which leads to a delocalization error. This error causes over-stabilization of fractionally charged species, leading to incorrect predictions for properties like charge transfer, reaction barriers, and band gaps. Hybrid functionals, such as PBE0, which incorporate a fraction of non-local Hartree-Fock exchange, are known to significantly reduce this convexity, yielding results closer to the exact-theory line.\n\nThe problem provides a model for this approximate energy behavior:\n$$\nE_{\\text{approx}}(f; E_N, E_{N+1}, \\kappa) \\equiv E_N + f\\left(E_{N+1} - E_N\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\kappa\\,f\\left(1-f\\right)\n$$\nHere, $E_N$ and $E_{N+1}$ are the energies for the integer electron systems, and $f$ is the fractional occupation. The term $E_N + f(E_{N+1} - E_N)$ represents the exact linear behavior, which we can denote as $E_{\\text{linear}}(f)$. The deviation from linearity is captured by the parabolic term, $\\delta E(f) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa f(1-f)$, where $\\kappa$ is a parameter quantifying the curvature. A positive $\\kappa$ corresponds to a convex energy profile (downward deviation, delocalization error), while a negative $\\kappa$ indicates a concave profile (upward deviation, over-localization error).\n\nWe are tasked with computing three metrics to quantify this deviation for two functionals, PBE and PBE0, characterized by their respective curvature parameters, $\\kappa_{\\text{PBE}}$ and $\\kappa_{\\text{PBE0}}$.\n\n1.  **Curvature, $C$**: The curvature is to be estimated using a central finite difference approximation of the second derivative at $f=0.5$ with a step size of $\\Delta f = 0.25$:\n    $$\n    C \\approx \\frac{E(0.5+\\Delta f) - 2E(0.5) + E(0.5-\\Delta f)}{(\\Delta f)^2} = \\frac{E(0.75) - 2E(0.5) + E(0.25)}{(0.25)^2}\n    $$\n    Let us substitute the model expression for $E_{\\text{approx}}(f)$ into the numerator. The linear part, $E_{\\text{linear}}(f)$, is a first-degree polynomial in $f$, and its second finite difference is identically zero. Therefore, the calculation only depends on the non-linear deviation term, $\\delta E(f) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa f(1-f)$.\n    The numerator becomes:\n    $$\n    \\delta E(0.75) - 2\\delta E(0.5) + \\delta E(0.25)\n    $$\n    $$\n    = \\left(-\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(0.75)(0.25)\\right) - 2\\left(-\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(0.5)(0.5)\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(0.25)(0.75)\\right)\n    $$\n    $$\n    = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left[ (0.1875) - 2(0.25) + (0.1875) \\right] = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left[ 0.375 - 0.5 \\right] = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2} (-0.125) = \\frac{\\kappa}{16}\n    $$\n    The denominator is $(\\Delta f)^2 = (0.25)^2 = (1/4)^2 = 1/16$.\n    Thus, the curvature estimate is:\n    $$\n    C = \\frac{\\kappa/16}{1/16} = \\kappa\n    $$\n    This is an exact result because a central difference formula for the second derivative is exact for any polynomial of degree up to $3$. Our deviation term is a quadratic. The computed curvature $C$ is therefore simply the input parameter $\\kappa$. The convexity flag, `is_convex`, is `True` if $C  0$ and `False` otherwise.\n\n2.  **Midpoint Deviation, $\\Delta_{\\text{mid}}$**: This metric is the deviation of the approximate energy from the exact linear energy at the midpoint, $f=0.5$.\n    $$\n    \\Delta_{\\text{mid}} \\equiv E(0.5) - \\left[E_N + 0.5\\left(E_{N+1} - E_N\\right)\\right] = E_{\\text{approx}}(0.5) - E_{\\text{linear}}(0.5) = \\delta E(0.5)\n    $$\n    Substituting $f=0.5$ into the deviation expression $\\delta E(f)$:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_{\\text{mid}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\kappa\\,(0.5)\\left(1-0.5\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\kappa\\,(0.25) = -\\frac{\\kappa}{8}\n    $$\n    This is also an exact analytical result that depends only on $\\kappa$.\n\n3.  **Integral Deviation, $\\Delta_{\\text{int}}$**: This metric measures the total deviation integrated over the entire fractional electron range $f \\in [0,1]$.\n    $$\n    \\Delta_{\\text{int}} \\equiv \\int_0^1 \\left[E(f) - E_{\\text{linear}}(f)\\right]\\,df = \\int_0^1 \\delta E(f)\\,df\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\Delta_{\\text{int}} = \\int_0^1 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa f(1-f)\\right)\\,df = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_0^1 (f-f^2)\\,df\n    $$\n    The integral can be solved analytically:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left[ \\frac{f^2}{2} - \\frac{f^3}{3} \\right]_0^1 = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right) = -\\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{6} \\right) = -\\frac{\\kappa}{12}\n    $$\n    Although an exact analytical solution exists, the problem mandates the use of the numerical trapezoidal rule with $N_{\\text{seg}} = 1000$ uniform segments. This numerical approach will be implemented. We will define a grid of $N_{\\text{seg}} + 1 = 1001$ points for $f$ from $0$ to $1$, evaluate the integrand $\\delta E(f)$ at these points, and then use a numerical integration routine (`numpy.trapz`) to compute the integral. This result should be extremely close to the analytical value of $-\\kappa/12$.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a function that takes $\\kappa$ as input and calculates the three metrics ($C$, $\\Delta_{\\text{mid}}$, $\\Delta_{\\text{int}}$) and the convexity flag. This function will be called for $\\kappa_{\\text{PBE}}$ and $\\kappa_{\\text{PBE0}}$ for each test case. The results will be assembled into the specified list-of-lists format.",

The model is constructed to quantify the effect of hybrid functionals—those that mix a fraction of Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange with a Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA)—on electron localization and charge-transport activation barriers. The goal is to derive and implement a programmatic evaluation of a delocalization error metric and its consequences for polaron hopping on a two-site surface motif, using only principles that do not assume the target result.\n\nFundamental bases to be used:\n- Exact DFT exhibits piecewise linear total energy as a function of electron number $n$ between integers, which implies that for fractional occupation $f \\in [0,1]$ of an added electron, the exact energy $E_{\\text{exact}}(f)$ is linear in $f$.\n- Self-interaction error in approximate functionals (such as in GGA) introduces convex curvature in $E(f)$, artificially stabilizing delocalized fractional occupations. A hybrid functional that includes a fraction $\\alpha$ of Hartree–Fock exchange mitigates this curvature and moves $E(f)$ toward piecewise linearity.\n- Classical Marcus electron transfer theory states that for symmetric electron transfer between equivalent sites, the activation barrier $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ equals one quarter of the reorganization energy $\\lambda$ when the reaction free energy $\\Delta G$ is zero, i.e., $\\Delta G^\\ddagger = \\lambda/4$.\n\nModel definitions to implement:\n1.

For a fractional occupation $f$ on a single site, write the approximate energy as\n$$\nE(f) = E_{\\text{lin}} + C(\\alpha) f(1 - f),\n$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{lin}}$ is the linear baseline consistent with exact DFT.

The solution proceeds by systematically applying the provided model definitions.\n\nThe core of the model is the competition between two opposing effects:\n1.  **Lattice-polaron stabilization**, quantified by the energy scale $L  0$. This term represents the energy gain from the relaxation of the crystal lattice around a localized charge, which favors integer occupations on the sites ($n_1 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$).\n2.  **Self-interaction error (SIE)**, inherent in approximate DFT functionals like GGA.

Its value is determined directly by the sign of $K(\\alpha)$, according to the provided definition:\n$$\n{\\rm IPR}(\\alpha) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1,  \\text{if } K(\\alpha)  0 \\quad (\\text{localized state}) \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2},  \\text{if } K(\\alpha) \\le 0 \\quad (\\text{delocalized state})\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAn IPR of $1$ corresponds to the electron being entirely on one site ($n_1^2 + n_2^2 = 1^2 + 0^2 = 1$), while an IPR of $1/2$ corresponds to equal sharing ($n_1^2 + n_2^2 = (1/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = 1/2$).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the activation barrier $\\Delta G^\\ddagger(\\alpha)$**\n\nThe activation barrier for an electron to hop between sites is the energy difference between the potentially delocalized transition state ($n_1=1/2$) and the localized ground state ($n_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$). This barrier exists only if the ground state is localized.\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\ddagger(\\alpha) = \n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{K(\\alpha)}{4},  \\text{if } K(\\alpha)  0 \\\\\n0,  \\text{if } K(\\alpha) \\le 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nIf the ground state is already delocalized ($K(\\alpha) \\le 0$), there is no barrier to hopping, and $\\Delta G^\\ddagger(\\alpha) = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the delocalization error metric $D(\\alpha)$**\n\nThis metric quantifies the deviation from piecewise linearity in the single-site energy model. It is independent of the two-site parameters ($L$) and depends only on $\\alpha$, $c_0$, and the normalization factor $\\Delta$.\n$$\nD(\\alpha) = \\frac{|C(\\alpha)|}{6 \\Delta} = \\frac{|-c_0(1 - \\alpha)|}{6 \\Delta}\n$$\nSince $c_0  0$ and $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$, the term $c_0(1 - \\alpha)$ is always non-negative. Therefore, the absolute value is redundant:\n$$\nD(\\alpha) = \\frac{c_0(1 - \\alpha)}{6 \\Delta}\n$$\n\n**Application to Test Cases:**\n\nWe apply this four-step procedure to each set of parameters $(\\alpha, L, c_0, \\Delta)$.\n\n- **Test 1:** $(\\alpha=0.0, L=0.30, c_0=0.40, \\Delta=1.0)$\n    1.  $K(0.0) = 2 [0.30 - 0.40(1 - 0.0)] = 2 [0.30 - 0.40] = 2(-0.10) = -0.20$ eV.\n    2.

            "problem": "You are asked to implement a complete, runnable program that models and compares two computational workflows used in computational electrochemistry for an oxide electrode: band edge alignment to vacuum and to a redox reference, and reaction energetics at electrochemical conditions. The comparison should be performed for three density functional approximations: Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE), PBE0, and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE). The program must compute well-defined quantities derived from first principles definitions and standard electrochemical thermodynamics, using a simplified but scientifically plausible parameterization that captures how hybrid functionals modify electronic energies through a fraction of exact exchange and (for screened hybrids) range separation.\n\nFundamental base and core definitions to use:\n- Kohn–Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) provides single-particle energies for electrons in a mean-field potential. Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) functionals such as PBE approximate exchange-correlation with semi-local dependence on the electronic density and its gradient. Hybrid functionals such as PBE0 and HSE mix a fraction of Hartree–Fock exact exchange with PBE exchange-correlation, which mitigates delocalization (self-interaction) error and typically increases band gaps and modifies band edge positions.\n- Global hybrid PBE0 mixes a fraction $\\alpha$ of exact exchange uniformly for all ranges.\n- Screened hybrid HSE mixes a fraction $\\alpha$ of short-range exact exchange, characterized by a range-separation (screening) parameter $\\mu$ that attenuates the exchange at distances beyond a characteristic range. A simple physically motivated model for the attenuation factor is $\\exp(-\\mu r_0)$ for a characteristic distance $r_0$.\n- Band edge alignment to vacuum is performed by adding the potential offset $\\Delta V$ between the plane-averaged electrostatic potential of the slab interior and the vacuum level to Kohn–Sham band edge energies. For valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM), this gives $E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}=\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}+\\Delta V$ and $E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}=\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}+\\Delta V$, where $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}$ are band edge energies referenced to the interior potential.\n- Alignment to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE) uses the empirical offset between vacuum and SHE, with the SHE level located $4.44\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ below vacuum at standard conditions. Converting a band edge energy to the SHE scale (in volts versus SHE) is obtained by $E^{\\mathrm{SHE}}=E^{\\mathrm{vac}}+4.44$, using the convention that $1\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ per electron corresponds to $1\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n- Reaction energetics for an adsorbed intermediate are evaluated starting from the electronic adsorption energy $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}$, with corrections for zero-point energy (ZPE) and entropy to obtain a standard free energy change $\\Delta G^0=\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}+\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ZPE}}+\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{corr}}$. Electrochemical conditions at electrode potential $U$ (in volts versus SHE) and $\\mathrm{pH}$ modify the free energy through the Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) relation derived from the electrochemical potential of protons and electrons at $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$: $\\Delta G(U,\\mathrm{pH})=\\Delta G^0 - n\\left(U + 0.059\\,\\mathrm{pH}\\right)$, where $n$ is the number of electrons transferred and $0.059\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ is $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln(10)$ at $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$. All energies are in $\\mathrm{eV}$ and potentials are in $\\mathrm{V}$ versus SHE.\n- To model hybrid functional corrections in a simplified, orbital-resolved manner consistent with mitigation of self-interaction error, use orbital sensitivity coefficients $K_{\\mathrm{VBM}}$ and $K_{\\mathrm{CBM}}$ (in $\\mathrm{eV}$) such that band edge shifts under PBE0 are $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE0}}=-\\alpha K_{\\mathrm{VBM}}$ and $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE0}}=+\\alpha K_{\\mathrm{CBM}}$. For HSE, include screening via $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{HSE}}=-\\alpha K_{\\mathrm{VBM}}\\exp(-\\mu r_0)$ and $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{HSE}}=+\\alpha K_{\\mathrm{CBM}}\\exp(-\\mu r_0)$. This symmetric widening around the mid-gap emulates the typical trend where VBM is pushed to lower energy and CBM to higher energy. Similarly, model the hybrid correction to adsorption energy with a reaction sensitivity coefficient $C_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$ such that $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{\\mathrm{PBE0}}=\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}+\\alpha C_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$ and $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{\\mathrm{HSE}}=\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}+\\alpha C_{\\mathrm{rxn}}\\exp(-\\mu r_0)$.

Absolute Band Edge Alignment**\n\nThe Kohn-Sham energies, $\\varepsilon$, are calculated relative to a mean potential inside the material.

For a generic functional $f$, the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) on the vacuum scale are:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}(f) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}(f) + \\Delta V\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}(f) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}(f) + \\Delta V\n$$\nThe band gap, $E_g$, is the difference between these two energies, which is independent of $\\Delta V$:\n$$\nE_g(f) = E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}(f) - E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}(f) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}(f) - \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}(f)\n$$\nIn electrochemistry, it is conventional to reference electrode potentials to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). Using the established convention that the SHE potential lies $4.44\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ below the vacuum level, the band edge energies in volts vs. SHE are given by:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{SHE}}(f) = E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}(f) + 4.44\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{SHE}}(f) = E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}(f) + 4.44\n$$\nHere, the numerical value of an energy in electron-volts ($\\mathrm{eV}$) is equivalent to the electrostatic potential in volts ($\\mathrm{V}$).\n\n**1.2. Reaction Free Energy**\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of a reaction at standard conditions, $\\Delta G^0$, is calculated from the electronic adsorption energy, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}$, by adding corrections for zero-point vibrational energy, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ZPE}}$, and entropic contributions, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{corr}}$ (where $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{corr}} = -T\\Delta S$):\n$$\n\\Delta G^0(f) = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(f) + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ZPE}} + \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{corr}}\n$$\nUnder an applied electrode potential $U$ (vs. SHE) and at a given $\\mathrm{pH}$, the reaction free energy, $\\Delta G(U,\\mathrm{pH})$, is calculated using the Computational Hydrogen Electrode (CHE) model. For a reaction step involving $n$ electron-proton pairs, this is:\n$$\n\\Delta G(U,\\mathrm{pH}; f) = \\Delta G^0(f) - n \\left( U + k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln(10) \\cdot \\mathrm{pH} \\right)\n$$\nAt a temperature $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, the term $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln(10)$ is approximately $0.059\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n\n**1.3. Hybrid Functional Corrections Model**\n\nThe problem provides a simplified, physically motivated model for the effect of including a fraction $\\alpha$ of exact exchange in hybrid functionals.\n\nFor the **PBE** functional, no corrections are applied. The energies are the baseline values:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}(\\mathrm{PBE}) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}(\\mathrm{PBE}) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{PBE}) = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}\n$$\n\nFor the global hybrid **PBE0** functional, the corrections are proportional to the mixing parameter $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}(\\mathrm{PBE0}) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}} - \\alpha K_{\\mathrm{VBM}}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}(\\mathrm{PBE0}) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}} + \\alpha K_{\\mathrm{CBM}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{PBE0}) = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}} + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{rxn}}\n$$\n\nFor the screened hybrid **HSE** functional, the corrections are attenuated by a screening factor $S = \\exp(-\\mu r_0)$, where $\\mu$ is the range-separation parameter and $r_0$ is a characteristic distance:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}(\\mathrm{HSE}) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}} - \\alpha K_{\\mathrm{VBM}} \\exp(-\\mu r_0)\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}(\\mathrm{HSE}) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}} + \\alpha K_{\\mathrm{CBM}} \\exp(-\\mu r_0)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{HSE}) = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}} + \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{rxn}} \\exp(-\\mu r_0)\n$$\n\n**2. Computational Workflow**\n\nThe implementation will process each test case by sequentially applying the above models for each of the three functionals. For a given parameter set from the test suite:\n\n**Step A: PBE Calculation**\n1.  Use the baseline energies $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$, and $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$ directly.\n2.  Calculate $E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}(\\mathrm{PBE})$ and $E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{vac}}(\\mathrm{PBE})$ using the potential offset $\\Delta V$.\n3.  Calculate $E_{\\mathrm{VBM}}^{\\mathrm{SHE}}(\\mathrm{PBE})$ and $E_{\\mathrm{CBM}}^{\\mathrm{SHE}}(\\mathrm{PBE})$ using the SHE offset of $4.44\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\n4.  Calculate the band gap $E_g(\\mathrm{PBE})$.\n5.  Calculate the standard free energy $\\Delta G^0(\\mathrm{PBE})$ using $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ZPE}}$ and $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{corr}}$.\n6.  Calculate the potential-dependent free energy $\\Delta G(U,\\mathrm{pH};\\mathrm{PBE})$ using $n$, $U$, and $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n7.  Store the resulting 7 quantities.\n\n**Step B: PBE0 Calculation**\n1.  Compute the PBE0-corrected energies: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}(\\mathrm{PBE0})$, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}(\\mathrm{PBE0})$, and $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{PBE0})$.\n2.  Repeat steps A.2 through A.6 using these PBE0-corrected energies to find the 7 quantities for PBE0.\n3.  Store the resulting quantities.\n\n**Step C: HSE Calculation**\n1.  Calculate the screening factor $S = \\exp(-\\mu r_0)$. Note that if $\\mu=0$, then $S=1$, and the HSE calculation becomes identical to the PBE0 calculation.\n2.  Compute the HSE-corrected energies: $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{VBM}}(\\mathrm{HSE})$, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{CBM}}(\\mathrm{HSE})$, and $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{ads}}(\\mathrm{HSE})$.\n3.  Repeat steps A.2 through A.6 using these HSE-corrected energies to find the 7 quantities for HSE.\n4.  Store the resulting quantities.\n\n**Step D: Aggregation and Output**\n1.  Combine the results from the three functionals into a list for the current test case.\n2.  Repeat for all test cases.\n3.  Format the final nested list of all results into a single-line string as specified.\n\nThis rigorous, step-by-step procedure ensures that all specified quantities are calculated correctly according to the provided physical and mathematical models.",
