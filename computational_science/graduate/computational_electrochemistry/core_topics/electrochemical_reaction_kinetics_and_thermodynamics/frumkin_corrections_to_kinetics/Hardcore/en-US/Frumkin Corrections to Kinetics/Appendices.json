            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the Debye length within the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann framework and an explanation of its role in Frumkin corrections to reaction kinetics. I will first derive the expression for the Debye length, then compute its value, and finally discuss its physical implications.\n\nThe analysis begins with the one-dimensional Poisson equation, which relates the electrostatic potential $\\psi(x)$ at a distance $x$ from the planar electrode surface to the local space charge density $\\rho(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of the electrolyte solution. The space charge density $\\rho(x)$ arises from the non-uniform distribution of ions in the diffuse layer. For a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte, the ions have valences $z_+ = +1$ and $z_- = -1$. In a dilute solution, the local concentrations of the cations, $c_+(x)$, and anions, $c_-(x)$, can be described by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nc_+(x) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_+ F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nc_-(x) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_- F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(+\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $c_{\\infty}$ is the bulk electrolyte concentration, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe space charge density is the net charge per unit volume:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = F(z_+ c_+(x) + z_- c_-(x)) = F(c_+(x) - c_-(x))\n$$\nSubstituting the Boltzmann distributions gives:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = F c_{\\infty} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sinh(u) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(u) - \\exp(-u))$, the charge density can be written compactly as:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = -2 F c_{\\infty} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho(x)$ into the Poisson equation yields the full, nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation for a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\frac{2 F c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of a small-potential linearization. This approximation, also known as the Debye-Hückel approximation, is valid when the potential energy of the ions is much smaller than the thermal energy, i.e., $|F\\psi(x)| \\ll RT$. In this limit, the hyperbolic sine function can be approximated by its argument: $\\sinh(u) \\approx u$. Applying this linearization to the PB equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} \\approx \\frac{2 F c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon} \\left(\\frac{F \\psi(x)}{RT}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon RT}\\right) \\psi(x)\n$$\nThis is the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. It is a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation of the form $\\frac{d^2\\psi}{dx^2} = \\kappa^2 \\psi(x)$, where $\\kappa^2$ is a constant. By comparison, we identify:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}{\\varepsilon RT}\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is $\\psi(x) = A\\exp(\\kappa x) + B\\exp(-\\kappa x)$. Applying the boundary condition that the potential vanishes far from the electrode, $\\psi(x \\to \\infty) = 0$, requires that $A=0$. Thus, the potential decays exponentially away from the surface: $\\psi(x) = \\psi_d \\exp(-\\kappa x)$, where $\\psi_d$ is the potential at the outer boundary of the compact layer ($x=0$).\n\nThe parameter $\\kappa$ has units of inverse length, and its reciprocal is the characteristic screening length of the electrostatic potential in the electrolyte. This length is defined as the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$:\n$$\n\\lambda_D \\equiv \\frac{1}{\\kappa} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon RT}{2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}}\n$$\nFor a general symmetric electrolyte with valence $z$, the expression is $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon RT}{2 z^2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}}$. For this problem, $z=1$, so the derived formula is correct.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\lambda_D$ using the provided data:\n$T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$\\varepsilon_r = 78.5$\n$\\varepsilon_0 = 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$\n$\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 = 78.5 \\times (8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}) \\approx 6.9505 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$\n$c_{\\infty} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$\n$R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$F = 96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\lambda_D$:\n$$\n\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{(78.5 \\times 8.8541878128 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}) \\times (8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K})}{2 \\times (1)^2 \\times (96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})^2 \\times (10\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}})}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_D \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1.72236 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.86186 \\times 10^{11}}}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx \\sqrt{9.2507 \\times 10^{-18}}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 3.0415 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nConverting to nanometers gives $\\lambda_D \\approx 3.0415\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. Rounding to three significant figures, we get $\\lambda_D = 3.04\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an explanation of how $\\lambda_D$ influences the diffuse-layer potential $\\psi_d$ and the implications for Frumkin corrections. This requires using the nonlinear PB framework. The solution to the full nonlinear PB equation provides a relationship between the surface charge density on the electrode, $\\sigma$, and the potential at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP), $\\psi_d$. This relationship is known as the Grahame equation:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{8 \\varepsilon R T c_{\\infty}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{z F \\psi_d}{2 R T}\\right)\n$$\nWe can express the pre-factor in terms of the Debye length $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon RT}{2 z^2 F^2 c_{\\infty}}}$. The pre-factor can be rewritten as $\\frac{2 \\varepsilon R T}{z F \\lambda_D}$, so the Grahame equation becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{2 \\varepsilon R T}{z F \\lambda_D} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{z F \\psi_d}{2 R T}\\right)\n$$\nFrom this equation, we can analyze the relationship between $\\lambda_D$ and $\\psi_d$ for a fixed surface charge $\\sigma$. If $\\lambda_D$ decreases (which occurs if the bulk concentration $c_{\\infty}$ or the ionic valence $z$ increases), then the term $1/\\lambda_D$ increases. To maintain a constant $\\sigma$, the term $\\sinh\\left(\\frac{z F \\psi_d}{2 R T}\\right)$ must decrease. Since $\\sinh(u)$ is a monotonically increasing function, a decrease in its value implies that its argument, and thus the magnitude of the potential $|\\psi_d|$, must also decrease.\nPhysically, $\\lambda_D$ represents the thickness of the diffuse layer over which the electrode's charge is screened. A smaller $\\lambda_D$ signifies more compact and effective screening of the surface charge by the counter-ions. Consequently, for a given surface charge density $\\sigma$, the potential drop across this thinner diffuse layer (i.e., $\\psi_d$) is smaller in magnitude.\n\nThe Frumkin correction addresses the effect of the electric double layer on the rate of an interfacial electron transfer reaction. The rate of such a reaction depends on the concentration of the reactant species at the plane of electron transfer, which is often approximated as the OHP. The potential at this plane, $\\psi_d$, modifies the local concentration of a reactant ion of charge number $z_{ion}$, denoted $c_{rxn}$, relative to its bulk concentration $c_{\\infty}$ according to the Boltzmann factor:\n$$\nc_{rxn} = c_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_{ion} F \\psi_d}{RT}\\right)\n$$\nThe observed reaction rate, and thus the measured current, is proportional to $c_{rxn}$. The Frumkin correction factor is the ratio $c_{rxn}/c_{\\infty}$, which quantifies the deviation of the observed rate from the 'intrinsic' rate that would be measured if $\\psi_d=0$.\nThe implication of the dependence of $\\psi_d$ on $\\lambda_D$ is now clear. A decrease in the Debye length $\\lambda_D$ (e.g., by adding an inert supporting electrolyte to increase the ionic strength) leads to a reduction in the magnitude of $|\\psi_d|$. This, in turn, makes the Frumkin correction factor, $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_{ion} F \\psi_d}{RT}\\right)$, approach a value of $1$. In other words, in solutions with high ionic strength and thus short Debye lengths, the potential in the diffuse layer is low, and the electrostatic modification of the local reactant concentration is minimized. As a result, the observed electrochemical kinetics more closely reflect the intrinsic kinetics of the reaction, free from the complicating effects of the diffuse double layer.",

The intrinsic charge-transfer step at the location where electron transfer occurs is assumed to obey a transition-state-theory form with a constant transfer coefficient $\\alpha=0.5$ in the high-overpotential Tafel regime, so that the kinetic current density depends exponentially on the local overpotential at the reaction plane.

Case 2: Reaction Plane at the Inner Helmholtz Plane (IHP)**\n\nHere, the reaction plane is at the IHP, so $\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}} = \\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}$. We need to find $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}/dE$. The potential drop across the first compact layer (metal-to-IHP) is $E - \\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}$.\n$$ d(E - \\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}) = \\frac{dq}{C_I} $$\n$$ dE - d\\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}} = \\frac{dq}{C_I} = \\frac{C_T dE}{C_I} $$\nDividing by $dE$:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}}{dE} = \\frac{C_T}{C_I} $$\nThe derivative $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}}}{dE} = \\frac{d\\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}}{dE} = 1 - \\frac{C_T}{C_I} = 1 - \\frac{120/11\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F\\,cm^{-2}}}{40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F\\,cm^{-2}}} = 1 - \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{8}{11} $$\nAgain, $0 < 8/11 < 1$, so $1 - d\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE$ is positive. The magnitude of the apparent Tafel slope is:\n$$ |b_{\\mathrm{IHP}}| = \\frac{|b_0|}{1 - d\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE} = \\frac{|b_0|}{1 - 8/11} = \\frac{|b_0|}{3/11} = \\frac{11}{3}|b_0| $$\n$$ |b_{\\mathrm{IHP}}| = \\frac{11}{3} \\times 118.3\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}} \\approx 433.8\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}} $$\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. For the stated capacitances, placing the reaction plane at the OHP yields an apparent Tafel slope of approximately $145\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}}$, whereas placing it at the IHP yields approximately $433\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}}$. Thus, moving the reaction plane deeper into the compact layer (IHP) increases the portion of the applied potential that drops between the reaction plane and bulk solution, inflating the apparent Tafel slope relative to the intrinsic value.**\nOur calculated values are $|b_{\\mathrm{OHP}}| \\approx 144.6\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}}$ (approx. $145$) and $|b_{\\mathrm{IHP}}| \\approx 433.8\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}}$ (approx. $433$). The numerical values are correct. The reasoning is also correct: The fraction of the applied potential that drops between the reaction plane and the bulk is $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE$. We found $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}/dE = 8/11$ and $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{OHP}}/dE = 2/11$. Since $8/11 > 2/11$, moving the reaction plane to the IHP (deeper into the double layer) does increase this fraction. This larger potential modulation makes kinetics less sensitive to the applied potential $E$, thus \"inflating\" the apparent Tafel slope $|b| = |dE/d\\log_{10}|j||$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The apparent Tafel slope is independent of whether the reaction plane is at the IHP or OHP and remains equal to the intrinsic value $b_0=2.303RT/(\\alpha F)\\approx 118\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}}$, because the double layer affects only the exchange current density and not the overpotential sensitivity.**\nThis is incorrect. Our calculations clearly show that the apparent Tafel slope is different for the two cases ($145\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}}$ and $433\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}}$), and both are different from the intrinsic value of $118\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}}$. The premise that the double layer does not affect overpotential sensitivity (the Frumkin effect) is contrary to the problem statement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Placing the reaction plane at the OHP increases the double-layer potential drop that enters the kinetic exponential relative to placing it at the IHP, causing the apparent Tafel slope at the OHP to exceed that at the IHP for the given capacitances.**\nThis statement makes two incorrect claims. First, it claims the effect of the potential drop is larger for the OHP case. Our analysis of the term $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE$ shows the opposite: $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}/dE = 8/11 > d\\phi_{\\mathrm{OHP}}/dE = 2/11$. Second, it claims that $|b_{\\mathrm{OHP}}| > |b_{\\mathrm{IHP}}|$. Our calculation shows the opposite: $|b_{\\mathrm{OHP}}| \\approx 145\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}} < |b_{\\mathrm{IHP}}| \\approx 433\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In the stated series-capacitance model, the fraction of the applied potential that appears between the reaction plane and the bulk, and hence the apparent Tafel slope, is the same whether the reaction plane is at the IHP or the OHP, because only the diffuse layer contributes to the drop between the reaction plane and bulk.**\nThis is incorrect. The fraction of the potential drop, $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE$, is different for the two cases ($8/11$ vs. $2/11$), and consequently, the apparent Tafel slopes are different. The reasoning is also flawed. The potential drop from the reaction plane to the bulk is indeed across the diffuse layer ($C_D$) when the reaction plane is at the OHP. However, when the reaction plane is at the IHP, the drop is across the IHP-OHP layer ($C_O$) *and* the diffuse layer ($C_D$) in series.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. With the given parameters, placing the reaction plane at the IHP causes the cathodic Tafel slope to reverse sign (i.e., $d\\eta_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE<0$), implying that increasing the magnitude of cathodic polarization would decrease the magnitude of the cathodic current in the Tafel regime.**\nThe sign of the Tafel slope would reverse if the term $1 - d\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE$ becomes negative, which requires $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE > 1$. For the case of the IHP, we calculated $d\\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}/dE = 8/11$, which is less than 1. Therefore, $d\\eta_{\\mathrm{rp}}/dE = 1 - d\\phi_{\\mathrm{IHP}}/dE = 3/11 > 0$. The slope does not reverse sign. Such an effect (an anomalous Tafel region) is physically possible but is not predicted by this simple series-capacitor model with positive capacitances.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
