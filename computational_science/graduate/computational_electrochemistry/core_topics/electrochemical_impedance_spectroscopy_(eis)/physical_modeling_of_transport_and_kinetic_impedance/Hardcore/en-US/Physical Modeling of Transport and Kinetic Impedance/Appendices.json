The result is calculable and corresponds to a measurable physical quantity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe Butler–Volmer equation describes the faradaic current density, $j_{\\mathrm{F}}$, as a function of the overpotential, $\\eta = E - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. For a single-step, single-electron transfer reaction, it is given by:\n$$j_{\\mathrm{F}} = j_{0} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F}{RT}\\eta\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha)nF}{RT}\\eta\\right) \\right]$$\nThe problem requires the derivation of the kinetic impedance, which, in its simplest form (charge-transfer resistance), is the differential resistance at the equilibrium potential ($\\eta=0$). The charge-transfer resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$, is defined as the inverse of the slope of the total faradaic current ($I_{\\mathrm{F}}$) versus overpotential ($\\eta$) curve, evaluated at $\\eta=0$.\nThe total faradaic current is $I_{\\mathrm{F}} = A \\cdot j_{\\mathrm{F}}$, where $A$ is the electrode area.\nFirst, we find the derivative of the current density with respect to the overpotential:\n$$\\frac{dj_{\\mathrm{F}}}{d\\eta} = \\frac{d}{d\\eta} \\left( j_{0} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F}{RT}\\eta\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha)nF}{RT}\\eta\\right) \\right] \\right)$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$\\frac{dj_{\\mathrm{F}}}{d\\eta} = j_{0} \\left[ \\frac{\\alpha n F}{RT}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F}{RT}\\eta\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha)nF}{RT}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha)nF}{RT}\\eta\\right) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{dj_{\\mathrm{F}}}{d\\eta} = j_{0} \\left[ \\frac{\\alpha n F}{RT}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F}{RT}\\eta\\right) + \\frac{(1-\\alpha)nF}{RT}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha)nF}{RT}\\eta\\right) \\right]$$\nWe evaluate this derivative at zero overpotential, $\\eta=0$. At this point, $\\exp(0) = 1$.\n$$\\left(\\frac{dj_{\\mathrm{F}}}{d\\eta}\\right)_{\\eta=0} = j_{0} \\left[ \\frac{\\alpha n F}{RT}(1) + \\frac{(1-\\alpha)nF}{RT}(1) \\right]$$\nSimplifying the expression inside the brackets:\n$$\\left(\\frac{dj_{\\mathrm{F}}}{d\\eta}\\right)_{\\eta=0} = j_{0} \\left[ \\frac{\\alpha n F + (1-\\alpha)nF}{RT} \\right] = j_{0} \\left[ \\frac{\\alpha n F + nF - \\alpha n F}{RT} \\right] = j_{0} \\frac{nF}{RT}$$\nThis expression represents the differential admittance per unit area at zero overpotential. The total differential admittance of the electrode is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{F}}}{d\\eta}\\right)_{\\eta=0} = A \\left(\\frac{dj_{\\mathrm{F}}}{d\\eta}\\right)_{\\eta=0} = A j_{0} \\frac{nF}{RT}$$\nThe charge-transfer resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$, is the inverse of this quantity:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ct}} = \\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dI_{\\mathrm{F}}}\\right)_{\\eta=0} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{dI_{\\mathrm{F}}}{d\\eta}\\right)_{\\eta=0}} = \\frac{RT}{A j_{0} nF}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the charge-transfer resistance. It is noteworthy that at $\\eta=0$, the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ is independent of the symmetry factor, $\\alpha$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ using the provided data:\n- $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $T = 312\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- $n = 1$\n- $F = 96485.33212\\ \\mathrm{C}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n- $A = 0.80\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- $j_{0} = 2.70 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$\n\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ct}} = \\frac{(8.314462618) \\cdot (312)}{(1) \\cdot (96485.33212) \\cdot (0.80) \\cdot (2.70 \\times 10^{-3})}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{ct}} = \\frac{2594.152336856}{208.4083173792} \\approx 12.44743\\ \\Omega$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R_{\\mathrm{ct}} = 12.45\\ \\Omega$.\n\nThe problem states that the high-frequency part of the impedance spectrum is modeled as the kinetic impedance in parallel with the interfacial capacitance. The impedance of such a parallel $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$-$C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$ circuit is given by $Z(\\omega) = (1/R_{\\mathrm{ct}} + i\\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}})^{-1}$. In a Nyquist plot ($-Z_{\\mathrm{im}}$ vs. $Z_{\\mathrm{re}}$), this circuit produces a semicircle with its high-frequency intercept at $Z_{\\mathrm{re}}=0$ (assuming no solution resistance) and its low-frequency intercept at $Z_{\\mathrm{re}}=R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$. The diameter of this semicircle is therefore equal to the charge-transfer resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$.\n\nThus, the diameter of the high-frequency semicircle is also $12.45\\ \\Omega$.\n\nThe two requested values are the charge-transfer resistance and the semicircle diameter.\n$R_{\\mathrm{ct}} = 12.45\\ \\Omega$\nSemicircle diameter = $12.45\\ \\Omega$",

The direction of current flow is along the thickness of the electrode, which we define as the $x$-axis, extending from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n\nThe problem states that in the high-frequency limit, capacitive effects are negligible, and Faradaic reactions are not considered for this ohmic calculation. Under these conditions, the conservation of charge for the electrolyte phase in one dimension simplifies to a statement that the electrolyte-phase current density, $j_{\\mathrm{e}}$, is constant along the path of the current.\n$$\n\\frac{d j_{\\mathrm{e}}}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that a uniform total current density $j$ is applied and is equal to the electrolyte-phase current density.

Finite Difference Discretization**\nThe domain $[0,L]$ is discretized into $N+1$ points $x_j = j \\Delta x$ for $j=0, 1, \\ldots, N$, with step size $\\Delta x = L/N$. We denote the concentration at these points as $\\tilde{c}_j = \\tilde{c}(x_j)$. The continuous equations are transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n**Equation for Interior Nodes ($j=1, 2, \\ldots, N-1$):**\nUsing the second-order central difference for the second derivative, the governing equation at node $x_j$ becomes:\n$$\nD \\left( \\frac{\\tilde{c}_{j-1} - 2 \\tilde{c}_j + \\tilde{c}_{j+1}}{\\Delta x^2} \\right) - i \\omega \\tilde{c}_j = 0\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\Delta x^2$ and rearranging terms to group coefficients of $\\tilde{c}_j$:\n$$\nD \\tilde{c}_{j-1} - (2D + i \\omega \\Delta x^2) \\tilde{c}_j + D \\tilde{c}_{j+1} = 0\n$$\nThis equation holds for each of the $N-1$ interior nodes.\n\n**Equation for the Reactive Boundary ($j=0$):**\nThe mixed kinetic boundary condition is discretized using the provided second-order one-sided approximation for the derivative:\n$$\n- D \\left( \\frac{-3 \\tilde{c}_0 + 4 \\tilde{c}_1 - \\tilde{c}_2}{2 \\Delta x} \\right) = \\alpha \\tilde{c}_0 + \\beta \\tilde{\\eta}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to bring all unknown concentrations $\\tilde{c}_j$ to the left side and known quantities to the right:\n$$\nD(3\\tilde{c}_0 - 4\\tilde{c}_1 + \\tilde{c}_2) = 2 \\Delta x (\\alpha \\tilde{c}_0 + \\beta \\tilde{\\eta})\n$$\n$$\n(3D - 2 \\Delta x \\alpha) \\tilde{c}_0 - 4D \\tilde{c}_1 + D \\tilde{c}_2 = 2 \\Delta x \\beta \\tilde{\\eta}\n$$\nThis forms the first equation in our linear system.\n\n**Equation for the Bulk Boundary ($j=N$):**\nThe Dirichlet boundary condition is simply:\n$$\n\\tilde{c}_N = 0\n$$\n\n**3.

Solving for Concentration and Impedance**\nThe linear system $\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{\\tilde{c}} = \\mathbf{b}$ is solved for the vector $\\mathbf{\\tilde{c}}$ using a standard linear algebra library. The first element of the solution, $\\tilde{c}_0$, is the complex concentration amplitude at the reactive interface.\n\nWith $\\tilde{c}_0$ known, the various current densities are computed:\n- Faradaic current density: $\\tilde{j}_F = n F (\\alpha \\tilde{c}_0 + \\beta \\tilde{\\eta})$\n- Double-layer current density: $\\tilde{j}_{\\mathrm{dl}} = i \\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}} \\tilde{\\eta}$\n- Total current density: $\\tilde{j} = \\tilde{j}_F + \\tilde{j}_{\\mathrm{dl}}$\n\nFinally, the complex impedance $\\tilde{Z}(\\omega)$ and its magnitude are calculated:\n$$\n\\tilde{Z}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}}{\\tilde{j}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad |\\tilde{Z}(\\omega)| = \\left| \\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}}{\\tilde{j}} \\right|\n$$\nThis procedure is implemented for each of the test cases provided in the problem statement.",
