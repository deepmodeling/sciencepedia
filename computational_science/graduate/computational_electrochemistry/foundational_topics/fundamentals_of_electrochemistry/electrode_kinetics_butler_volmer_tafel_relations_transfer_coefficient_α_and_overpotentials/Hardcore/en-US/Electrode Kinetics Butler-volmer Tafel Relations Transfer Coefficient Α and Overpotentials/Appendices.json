            "problem": "In an automated parameter-identification workflow for a physics-based lithium-ion battery model, the electrode charge-transfer kinetics are assumed to follow a single-step electron-transfer mechanism with reaction order $n=1$. The workflow extracts the anodic Tafel slope by fitting a straight line to the plot of overpotential $\\eta$ versus base-$10$ logarithm of the current density $j$ at sufficiently large positive overpotentials, where the anodic branch dominates.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between the anodic Tafel slope $b_a$ and the anodic transfer coefficient $\\alpha_a$, the calculation of $\\alpha_a$ from the given experimental data, and a physical interpretation of the result. The analysis begins with the Butler-Volmer equation, which describes the current density $j$ as a function of overpotential $\\eta$ for a single-step electrochemical reaction.\n\nThe general form of the Butler-Volmer equation is:\n$$j = j_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_a n F \\eta}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_c n F \\eta}{RT}\\right) \\right]$$\nwhere $j$ is the net current density, $j_0$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha_a$ is the anodic transfer coefficient, $\\alpha_c$ is the cathodic transfer coefficient, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the rate-determining step, $F$ is the Faraday constant ($96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$), $R$ is the universal gas constant ($8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$), and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The overpotential is defined as $\\eta = E - E_{eq}$, where $E$ is the electrode potential and $E_{eq}$ is the equilibrium potential. The problem specifies a single-step mechanism with $n=1$.\n\nThe problem states that the Tafel slope is measured at \"sufficiently large positive overpotentials\". Under these conditions, the anodic component of the current is significantly larger than the cathodic component. Mathematically, for large positive $\\eta$:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_a n F \\eta}{RT}\\right) \\gg \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_c n F \\eta}{RT}\\right)$$\nTherefore, the Butler-Volmer equation can be simplified to describe the anodic current density, $j_a$:\n$$j \\approx j_a = j_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_a n F \\eta}{RT}\\right)$$\nThis relationship is known as the Tafel equation in its exponential form. To derive the Tafel slope, we must rearrange this equation to express $\\eta$ as a function of the base-$10$ logarithm of $j$, as per the problem's description of the experimental plot.\n\nFirst, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(j) = \\ln(j_0) + \\frac{\\alpha_a n F \\eta}{RT}$$\nSolving for $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{RT}{\\alpha_a n F} (\\ln(j) - \\ln(j_0)) = \\frac{RT}{\\alpha_a n F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{j}{j_0}\\right)$$\nTo match the experimental plot which uses the base-$10$ logarithm, we use the conversion $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$, where $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.303$:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{2.303 RT}{\\alpha_a n F} \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{j}{j_0}\\right)$$\nThis equation can be expanded into the linear form $\\eta = a + b_a \\log_{10}(j)$:\n$$\\eta = \\left(-\\frac{2.303 RT}{\\alpha_a n F} \\log_{10}(j_0)\\right) + \\left(\\frac{2.303 RT}{\\alpha_a n F}\\right) \\log_{10}(j)$$\nThe anodic Tafel slope, $b_a$, is the slope of the $\\eta$ versus $\\log_{10}(j)$ plot, which is the coefficient of the $\\log_{10}(j)$ term.\n$$b_a = \\frac{d\\eta}{d\\log_{10}(j)} = \\frac{2.303 RT}{\\alpha_a n F}$$\nThis is the derived relation between the anodic Tafel slope $b_a$ and the anodic transfer coefficient $\\alpha_a$.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of $\\alpha_a$ by rearranging this expression:\n$$\\alpha_a = \\frac{2.303 RT}{b_a n F}$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Anodic Tafel slope, $b_a = 120\\,\\mathrm{mV\\,dec^{-1}} = 0.120\\,\\mathrm{V\\,dec^{-1}}$\n- Number of electrons, $n=1$\n- Temperature, $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nUsing the values for the constants $R$ and $F$:\n$$\\alpha_a = \\frac{2.303 \\times (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(0.120\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times 1 \\times (96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})}$$\nThe units are consistent, since $\\mathrm{J\\,C^{-1}} = \\mathrm{V}$.\n$$\\alpha_a = \\frac{5705.85\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol}^{-1}}{11578.2\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.49280$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\\alpha_a \\approx 0.493$$\n\nFinally, we explain the physical meaning of $\\alpha_a$ and the implication of this value.\nThe anodic transfer coefficient, $\\alpha_a$, is a measure of how the activation energy barrier for the anodic reaction (oxidation) is affected by a change in the electrode potential. It represents the fraction of the overpotential $\\eta$ that acts to lower the activation barrier for the forward (anodic) reaction.\nFor a single-step, one-electron transfer reaction ($n=1$), the transfer coefficients are related to the more fundamental symmetry factor, $\\beta$, by the relations $\\alpha_a = 1-\\beta$ and $\\alpha_c = \\beta$. The symmetry factor $\\beta$ (typically between $0$ and $1$) describes the symmetry of the activation energy barrier. It represents the fraction of the potential that assists the cathodic reaction.\nOur calculated value is $\\alpha_a \\approx 0.493$. This implies a symmetry factor $\\beta = 1 - \\alpha_a \\approx 1 - 0.493 = 0.507$.\nA symmetry factor of $\\beta \\approx 0.5$ (and correspondingly $\\alpha_a \\approx 0.5$) signifies that the activation energy barrier is nearly symmetrical. In the context of transition state theory, this means the transition state is located approximately halfway along the reaction coordinate between the initial (reactant) and final (product) states.\nThe computed value of $\\beta \\approx 0.507$ suggests that the transition state is structurally and energetically slightly closer to the reduced species (the product of the cathodic reaction) than to the oxidized species (the reactant of the cathodic reaction). In other words, the energy barrier is almost perfectly symmetric, which is a common finding for simple, fast electron transfer reactions.",

Instead of plotting $\\log_{10}\\lvert i\\rvert$ against the activation overpotential $\\eta$, the researcher mistakenly plots $\\log_{10}\\lvert i\\rvert$ against $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ and fits a straight line to extract a Tafel slope and an exchange current density.\n\nFrom the standpoint of first principles of electrode kinetics and thermodynamics, explain the consequences of plotting $\\log_{10}\\lvert i\\rvert$ versus $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ instead of $\\eta$ on the extracted Tafel slope and exchange current density, including the roles (if any) of uncompensated ohmic resistance in the electrolyte and concentration polarization.

Using $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ in place of $\\eta$ only shifts the $\\log_{10}\\lvert i\\rvert$–potential plot by a constant if $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ differs from $\\eta$ by a constant offset; thus the Tafel slope is unchanged but the intercept (and hence the inferred exchange current density) is shifted. However, if $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ includes an $i$-dependent uncompensated ohmic drop or concentration overpotential, the plot exhibits curvature and an apparently larger Tafel slope at higher $\\lvert i\\rvert$. The correct overpotential is $\\eta = \\left(E_{\\mathrm{meas}} - i R_u\\right) - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, where $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is the Nernst equilibrium potential evaluated at the appropriate activities (or after transport correction). For the numerical case, $E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = E^{\\circ\\prime} + \\dfrac{RT}{F}\\ln\\!\\left(\\dfrac{a_{\\mathrm{Ox}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Red}}}\\right)$ and $\\eta = 0.091\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nB. Because $\\eta$ and $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ differ only by a constant, plotting $\\log_{10}\\lvert i\\rvert$ versus $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ leaves both the slope and the intercept unchanged; thus no corrections are needed. The overpotential is simply $\\eta = E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ in any reference scale, so the numerical value is $\\eta = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nC. The Tafel slope depends on the reference electrode; plotting versus $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ changes the slope unless the data are referenced to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). The overpotential should be computed as $\\eta = E_{\\mathrm{meas}} - E_{\\mathrm{ocp}}$ with no resistance correction.

            "solution": "The problem statement poses a standard-yet-fundamental question in experimental electrochemistry concerning the correct analysis of kinetic data. It is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution. We shall proceed.\n\nThe core of electrode kinetics is described by the Butler-Volmer equation, which relates the net current density $i$ to the activation overpotential $\\eta$. For a one-electron reaction, $n=1$, it is:\n$$i = i_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha)F\\eta}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\alpha F\\eta}{RT}\\right) \\right]$$\nHere, $i_0$ is the exchange current density, and $\\alpha$ is the charge transfer coefficient. The activation overpotential, $\\eta$, is the quantity that thermodynamically drives the electrode reaction away from equilibrium. It is defined as the difference between the actual potential at the electrode-electrolyte interface, $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$, and the equilibrium potential, $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$\\eta = E_{\\mathrm{int}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$$\nAll potentials, including $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, must be measured or defined with respect to the same reference electrode, here specified as $\\mathrm{Ag}/\\mathrm{AgCl}$.\n\nThe potential measured by the potentiostat, $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, is the potential of the working electrode relative to the reference electrode. However, this is not identical to the interfacial potential $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$ due to the unavoidable uncompensated ohmic potential drop, $iR_u$, across the electrolyte solution between the working electrode surface and the tip of the reference electrode capillary. The correct relationship is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{int}} = E_{\\mathrm{meas}} - iR_u$$\nThe sign is negative because for an anodic (positive) current $i$, the externally applied potential $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ must be more positive than $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$ to drive the current through the resistance $R_u$.\n\nThe equilibrium potential, $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, is determined by the activities of the redox species at the electrode surface via the Nernst equation. Since the problem explicitly states mass transport is negligible, the surface activities are identical to the bulk activities, $a_{\\mathrm{Ox}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{Red}}$. For the reaction $\\mathrm{Ox} + e^- \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Red}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = E^{\\circ\\prime} + \\frac{RT}{nF}\\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Ox}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Red}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $n=1$ for a one-electron process.\n\nCombining these definitions, the correct expression for the activation overpotential $\\eta$ in terms of measurable quantities is:\n$$\\eta = (E_{\\mathrm{meas}} - iR_u) - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$$\n\nAt high overpotentials ($\\lvert\\eta\\rvert \\gg RT/F$), one of the exponential terms in the Butler-Volmer equation becomes negligible, leading to the Tafel equation. For a sufficiently positive $\\eta$ (anodic process), this is:\n$$i \\approx i_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{(1-\\alpha)F\\eta}{RT}\\right)$$\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm gives the familiar linear Tafel plot relationship:\n$$\\log_{10}(i) = \\log_{10}(i_0) + \\frac{(1-\\alpha)F}{2.303RT}\\eta$$\nThis can be rewritten as $\\eta = b_a \\log_{10}(i) - b_a \\log_{10}(i_0)$, where $b_a = \\frac{2.303RT}{(1-\\alpha)F}$ is the anodic Tafel slope. An analogous expression exists for the cathodic branch. A correct Tafel analysis requires plotting $\\log_{10}\\lvert i\\rvert$ versus $\\eta$.\n\nThe researcher's mistake is plotting $\\log_{10}\\lvert i\\rvert$ versus $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$. Let us analyze the consequences. From the above relations, we have:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\eta + E_{\\mathrm{eq}} + iR_u$$\nSubstituting the Tafel expression for $\\eta$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\left(b_a \\log_{10}(i) - b_a \\log_{10}(i_0)\\right) + E_{\\mathrm{eq}} + iR_u$$\nThis equation reveals the consequences:\n1.  **Effect on Intercept and Exchange Current ($i_0$)**: Even if we neglect the ohmic drop ($R_u = 0$), the equation becomes $E_{\\mathrm{meas}} = b_a \\log_{10}(i/i_0) + E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. A plot of $\\log_{10}(i)$ versus $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is merely a plot of $\\log_{10}(i)$ versus $\\eta$ shifted along the potential axis by a constant amount, $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. The slope, $d(\\log_{10}i)/d(E_{\\mathrm{meas}})$, would remain correct. However, the exchange current $i_0$ is the current at $\\eta = 0$, which corresponds to $E_{\\mathrm{meas}} = E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. If the researcher extrapolates the line to $E_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 0$ (instead of $E_{\\mathrm{meas}} = E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$) to find the current, the resulting value will be incorrect. This means the inferred exchange current density will be wrong.\n\n2.  **Effect on Tafel Slope ($b_a$)**: The term $iR_u$ is not constant but depends on the current $i$. The relationship between $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ and $\\log_{10}(i)$ is therefore not linear. To find the apparent Tafel slope, $b_a^{\\mathrm{app}}$, extracted from a plot of $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ vs $\\log_{10}(i)$, we differentiate:\n$$b_a^{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{d(\\log_{10}i)} = \\frac{d}{d(\\log_{10}i)}\\left(b_a \\log_{10}(i) + E_{\\mathrm{eq}} - b_a \\log_{10}(i_0) + iR_u\\right)$$\n$$b_a^{\\mathrm{app}} = b_a + R_u \\frac{di}{d(\\log_{10}i)} = b_a + R_u \\frac{d(10^{\\log_{10}i})}{d(\\log_{10}i)} = b_a + (2.303) iR_u$$\nThe apparent Tafel slope is the true slope $b_a$ plus a positive, current-dependent term. This means the plot of $\\log_{10}(i)$ versus $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ will exhibit upward curvature (it becomes steeper at higher currents). A linear fit over any significant current range will yield an apparent slope $b_a^{\\mathrm{app}}$ that is larger than the true kinetic slope $b_a$. The same is true for concentration polarization, which also introduces non-linearity and distorts the apparent slope.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation for the given case.\nConstants: $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $R=8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $F=96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$, $n=1$.\nThe thermal voltage factor is $\\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314)(298)}{96485} \\approx 0.02569\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the equilibrium potential $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = E^{\\circ\\prime} + \\frac{RT}{F}\\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Ox}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Red}}}\\right) = 0.250\\,\\mathrm{V} + (0.02569\\,\\mathrm{V})\\ln\\left(\\frac{10.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}}\\right)$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.250\\,\\mathrm{V} + (0.02569\\,\\mathrm{V})\\ln(10) = 0.250\\,\\mathrm{V} + (0.02569\\,\\mathrm{V})(2.3026) \\approx 0.250\\,\\mathrm{V} + 0.05916\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.3092\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nSecond, calculate the uncompensated ohmic drop $iR_u$:\n$$iR_u = (5.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A})(20.0\\,\\Omega) = 0.100\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nThird, calculate the activation overpotential $\\eta$:\n$$\\eta = (E_{\\mathrm{meas}} - iR_u) - E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = (0.500\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.100\\,\\mathrm{V}) - 0.3092\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\eta = 0.400\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.3092\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.0908\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nTo three significant figures, $\\eta = 0.091\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nLet us evaluate the provided options based on this derivation.\n\nA. This option correctly states that in the absence of $i$-dependent effects, plotting vs $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ instead of $\\eta$ results in a constant shift, altering the intercept (and inferred $i_0$) but not the slope. It correctly identifies that an $i$-dependent ohmic drop or concentration polarization introduces curvature and leads to an apparently larger Tafel slope. It presents the correct formula for the activation overpotential: $\\eta = (E_{\\mathrm{meas}} - iR_u) - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. The formula given for $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is also correct. The final numerical value, $\\eta = 0.091\\,\\mathrm{V}$, matches our calculation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. This option claims $\\eta$ and $E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ differ by a constant and that no corrections are needed. This is fundamentally false, as it ignores both the equilibrium potential $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ and the current-dependent ohmic drop $iR_u$. It incorrectly defines $\\eta = E_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, which is a gross misunderstanding of the concept of overpotential.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. This option incorrectly claims the Tafel slope depends on the reference electrode. The overpotential $\\eta$ is a difference of potentials ($E_{\\mathrm{int}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$), and as such is invariant to the choice of reference electrode, provided both potentials are referenced to it. It also incorrectly advises against resistance correction. The formula given is for the total overpotential, not the activation overpotential. While the numerical calculation for its faulty formula is arithmetically correct ($\\eta = E_{\\mathrm{meas}} - E_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.309\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.191\\,\\mathrm{V}$), it is physically irrelevant to the activation kinetics.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This option incorrectly claims the Tafel slope is invariant even when ohmic drop is present. As we have rigorously shown, the apparent slope $b_a^{\\mathrm{app}}$ is increased by the term $(2.303)iR_u$. The proposed formula for $\\eta$ is doubly flawed: it uses the wrong sign for the $iR_u$ correction and incorrectly subtracts the formal potential $E^{\\circ\\prime}$ instead of the equilibrium potential $E_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, only option A provides a scientifically correct and complete description of the situation and the correct numerical result.",

For example, the output format must be exactly like $[\\,[b_{A,i_0}^{\\text{Tafel}},\\ b_{A,\\alpha}^{\\text{Tafel}},\\ b_{A,i_0}^{\\text{Full}},\\ b_{A,\\alpha}^{\\text{Full}}],\\ \\ldots\\,]$ with no additional text.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard exercise in electrochemical kinetics involving parameter estimation from synthetic data, which is based on the fundamental Butler-Volmer equation. All parameters, conditions, and objectives are clearly defined and scientifically sound.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows:\nFirst, we synthesize noiseless current density data for each test case using the provided ground-truth parameters. The relationship between net current density, $i$, and overpotential, $\\eta$, is described by the Butler-Volmer equation:\n$$\ni(\\eta) = i_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha) n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nHere, $i_0$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha$ is the anodic transfer coefficient (also called the symmetry factor), $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the elementary reaction, $F$ is Faraday's constant ($96485.33212 \\, \\mathrm{C/mol}$), $R$ is the ideal gas constant ($8.31446261815324 \\, \\mathrm{J/(mol\\cdot K)}$), and $T$ is the absolute temperature. This equation forms the basis for generating the synthetic measurement set $(\\eta_j, i_j)$ for each case.\n\nSecond, we estimate the parameters $(i_0, \\alpha)$ from the synthetic data using two distinct methods.\n\nMethod 1: Log-Linear \"Tafel\" Regression\nThe Tafel approximation is valid in the region of high anodic overpotential, where $\\eta \\gg RT/(nF)$. In this regime, the second exponential term in the Butler-Volmer equation, representing the cathodic reaction rate, becomes negligible compared to the first term (anodic rate). The equation simplifies to:\n$$\ni(\\eta) \\approx i_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta}{R T}\\right)\n$$\nTo perform a linear regression, we take the natural logarithm of both sides, yielding the Tafel equation:\n$$\n\\ln(i) = \\ln(i_0) + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F}{R T}\\right) \\eta\n$$\nThis equation is in the linear form $y = c + mx$, where $y = \\ln(i)$, $x = \\eta$, the intercept is $c = \\ln(i_0)$, and the slope is $m = \\frac{\\alpha n F}{R T}$.\nFor each test case, we perform a linear least-squares regression on the data points with positive overpotential ($\\eta > 0$) to find the best-fit slope $\\hat{m}$ and intercept $\\hat{c}$. The parameter estimates, denoted with a hat ($\\hat{\\theta}$), are then calculated as:\n$$\n\\hat{i}_{0, \\text{Tafel}} = \\exp(\\hat{c})\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha}_{\\text{Tafel}} = \\hat{m} \\frac{R T}{n F}\n$$\nThe accuracy of this method is expected to be poor when overpotentials are small, as the neglected cathodic term is significant, violating the core assumption of the approximation.\n\nMethod 2: Full Non-Linear Fit\nThis method utilizes the complete Butler-Volmer equation as the fitting model without approximation. We seek the parameter values $(\\hat{i}_0, \\hat{\\alpha})$ that minimize the sum of squared differences between the measured current densities $i_j$ and the model's predicted values $i(\\eta_j; \\hat{i}_0, \\hat{\\alpha})$. This is a non-linear optimization problem. We employ the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as implemented in `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`, to find the optimal parameters. The model function for the fit is:\n$$\nf(\\eta, i_0, \\alpha) = i_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha) n F \\eta}{R T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis fit is performed using all available data points for each case, including both positive and negative overpotentials where applicable. Since the synthetic data is noiseless and generated directly from this model, the non-linear fit is expected to recover the true parameters with very high accuracy, limited only by numerical precision.\n\nFinally, for each parameter $\\theta \\in \\{i_0, \\alpha\\}$ and each estimation method, we quantify the estimation error using the fractional bias, defined as:\n$$\n\\text{Fractional Bias} = \\frac{\\hat{\\theta} - \\theta_{\\text{true}}}{\\theta_{\\text{true}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\theta}$ is the estimated parameter value and $\\theta_{\\text{true}}$ is the ground-truth value provided in the problem statement. The program will calculate the four required fractional biases for each of the four test cases and format them as specified.",
