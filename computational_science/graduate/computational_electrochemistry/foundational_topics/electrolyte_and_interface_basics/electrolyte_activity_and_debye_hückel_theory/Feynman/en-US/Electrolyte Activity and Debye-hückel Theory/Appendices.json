            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in physical chemistry, grounded in the established principles of electrolyte solutions and Debye-Hückel theory. All necessary data are provided, and the stated assumptions, while simplifying, are explicit and acceptable for defining a solvable theoretical model.\n\nThe task is to compute the ionic strength, $I$, of a given aqueous electrolyte mixture. The problem requires that the derivation begin from fundamental principles of Debye-Hückel (DH) theory.\n\nThe DH theory describes the electrostatic environment around an ion in solution. It starts with the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which relates the electrostatic potential, $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$, to the local charge density of the surrounding ions, $\\rho_e(\\mathbf{r})$. In the linear response approximation, valid for small potentials ($|z_i e \\psi| \\ll k_B T$), this relationship simplifies to the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\kappa^2 \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe parameter $\\kappa$, known as the inverse Debye length or the screening parameter, is defined by its square:\n$$\n\\kappa^2 = \\frac{e^2}{\\varepsilon k_B T} \\sum_i n_i^0 z_i^2\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity of the solvent, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z_i$ is the charge number of ion species $i$, and $n_i^0$ is its bulk number density. The summation term $\\sum_i n_i^0 z_i^2$ accounts for the contributions of all mobile ion species to the screening of the potential. This term captures the essence of ionic interaction strength.\n\nFor practical chemical calculations, it is convenient to work with molar concentrations, $c_i$ (in units of $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$), rather than number densities, $n_i^0$. The two are related by Avogadro's number, $N_A$, such that $n_i^0 = c_i N_A \\times 1000$ (with $c_i$ in $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$ and $n_i^0$ in $\\mathrm{m^{-3}}$). The ionic strength, $I$, as defined by Lewis and Randall, provides a measure of ion concentration weighted by charge, using molarities. Its definition is:\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i c_i z_i^2\n$$\nThis is the expression we must evaluate for the given solution. The units of $c_i$ are traditionally $\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, and thus the ionic strength $I$ also carries these units.\n\nThe solution is prepared with three strong electrolytes, which are assumed to dissociate completely:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item $\\mathrm{NaCl} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Na}^+ + \\mathrm{Cl}^-$\n    \\item $\\mathrm{MgSO_4} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Mg}^{2+} + \\mathrm{SO_4}^{2-}$\n    \\item $\\mathrm{K_2CO_3} \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{K}^+ + \\mathrm{CO_3}^{2-}$\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nThe stoichiometric molarities are given as $c_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} = 0.120\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, $c_{\\mathrm{MgSO_4}} = 0.0350\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$, and $c_{\\mathrm{K_2CO_3}} = 0.0600\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of physical chemistry, specifically the Debye-Hückel theory, and is well-posed with all necessary information provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe derivation of the Debye length, $\\lambda_{D}$, starts from the Poisson equation, which relates the electrostatic potential, $\\phi(\\vec{r})$, to the local charge density, $\\rho(\\vec{r})$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r})}{\\varepsilon}\n$$\nHere, $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{r} \\varepsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity of the solvent medium.

For an electrolyte containing ion species $i$ with charge $z_i e$ and bulk number concentration $n_i^0$, the local number concentration $n_i(\\vec{r})$ at a point where the potential is $\\phi(\\vec{r})$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$\nn_i(\\vec{r}) = n_i^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\vec{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the elementary charge, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe local charge density is the sum of the charges of all ion species present:\n$$\n\\rho(\\vec{r}) = \\sum_i z_i e n_i(\\vec{r}) = \\sum_i z_i e n_i^0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi(\\vec{r})}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Poisson equation gives the full Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The problem specifies the use of the linearized regime, which is valid when the electrostatic potential energy is much smaller than the thermal energy, i.e., $|z_i e \\phi(\\vec{r})| \\ll k_B T$. This allows for a first-order Taylor series expansion of the exponential term: $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$.

The ionic strength is typically defined in terms of molar concentrations $C_i$ (in units of $\\mathrm{mol/L}$ or $\\mathrm{M}$) as $I = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i C_i z_i^2$.

Since $I$, $T$, and $\\varepsilon_r$ are fixed, $\\kappa$ is a constant for this experiment.\n\n$5$. Let's analyze the resulting expression for $\\ln \\gamma_i$. Let the term in the parenthesis be a constant $A$:\n$$ A = \\frac{e^2 \\kappa}{8\\pi\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r k_\\mathrm{B} T} $$\nAll quantities in $A$ ($e, \\kappa, \\varepsilon_0, \\varepsilon_r, k_\\mathrm{B}, T$) are positive constants under the given conditions. Therefore, $A  0$. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_i = -A z_i^2 $$\n\n$6$. From this final form, we can draw the following conclusions:\n-   **Sign**: Since $A  0$ and $z_i^2 \\ge 0$ (and $z_i \\ne 0$ for an ion), the value of $\\ln \\gamma_i$ is always negative. This reflects the energetic stabilization of the ion by its surrounding ionic atmosphere. A negative $\\ln \\gamma_i$ implies $\\gamma_i  1$.\n-   **Dependence on $z_i$**: The value of $\\ln \\gamma_i$ is proportional to the square of the charge number, $z_i^2$. Consequently, the magnitude of $\\ln \\gamma_i$ scales with $z_i^2$. Note that the sign of the charge ($+z_i$ or $-z_i$) does not affect the value of $\\ln \\gamma_i$, as it depends on $z_i^2$.\n-   **Magnitude Ratio**: For the three probes with $|z_i| = 1, 2, 3$, the magnitudes of $\\ln \\gamma_i$ will be:\n    -   For $|z_i|=1$: $|\\ln \\gamma_1| = A \\cdot (1)^2 = A$\n    -   For $|z_i|=2$: $|\\ln \\gamma_2| = A \\cdot (2)^2 = 4A$\n    -   For $|z_i|=3$: $|\\ln \\gamma_3| = A \\cdot (3)^2 = 9A$\n    The ratio of these magnitudes is $|\\ln \\gamma_1| : |\\ln \\gamma_2| : |\\ln \\gamma_3| = A : 4A : 9A = 1:4:9$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At fixed $I$, $\\ln \\gamma_i$ is negative and its magnitude increases linearly with $|z_i|$; the magnitude ratio for $|z_i| = 1, 2, 3$ is $1:2:3$.**\n-   \"$\\ln \\gamma_i$ is negative\": This is correct.\n-   \"magnitude increases linearly with $|z_i|$\": This is incorrect. The magnitude scales with $z_i^2$.\n-   \"ratio... is $1:2:3$\": This is incorrect. The ratio is $1:4:9$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. At fixed $I$, $\\ln \\gamma_i$ is independent of $z_i$; the magnitude is the same for $|z_i| = 1, 2, 3$.**\n-   \"independent of $z_i$\": This is incorrect. The derived expression $\\ln \\gamma_i = -A z_i^2$ shows a strong dependence on $z_i$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. At fixed $I$, $\\ln \\gamma_i$ is negative and its magnitude scales with $z_i^2$; the magnitude ratio for $|z_i| = 1, 2, 3$ is $1:4:9$.**\n-   \"$\\ln \\gamma_i$ is negative\": This is correct.\n-   \"magnitude scales with $z_i^2$\": This is correct, as shown by $|\\ln \\gamma_i| = A z_i^2$.\n-   \"magnitude ratio... is $1:4:9$\": This is correct, as derived from the $z_i^2$ scaling.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. At fixed $I$, $\\ln \\gamma_i$ is positive and its magnitude scales with $z_i^2$; the magnitude ratio for $|z_i| = 1, 2, 3$ is $1:4:9$.**\n-   \"$\\ln \\gamma_i$ is positive\": This is incorrect. The stabilizing effect of the ionic atmosphere leads to a negative excess chemical potential and thus a negative $\\ln \\gamma_i$.\n-   The scaling and ratio are correct, but the sign is wrong.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. At fixed $I$, $\\ln \\gamma_i$ is negative and its magnitude scales with $|z_i|^3$; the magnitude ratio for $|z_i| = 1, 2, 3$ is $1:8:27$.**\n-   \"$\\ln \\gamma_i$ is negative\": This is correct.\n-   \"magnitude scales with $|z_i|^3$\": This is incorrect. The scaling is with $z_i^2$.\n-   \"ratio... is $1:8:27$\": This is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
