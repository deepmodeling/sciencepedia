It is a standard, well-posed problem in computational electrochemistry based on sound scientific principles. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution is derived as follows.\n\nThe electrostatic potential $\\phi(x)$ in the one-dimensional electrolyte domain ($x>0$) is governed by Poisson’s equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho(x)$ is the local net charge density and $\\epsilon$ is the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte.\n\nThe charge density $\\rho(x)$ is determined by the local number densities of the cations, $n_+(x)$, and anions, $n_-(x)$, which for a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte with charge $\\pm e$ is given by:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = e n_+(x) - e n_-(x)\n$$\nAccording to the mean-field approximation, the ion densities follow a Boltzmann distribution, relating their local concentration to the local electrostatic potential $\\phi(x)$:\n$$\nn_+(x) = n_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nn_-(x) = n_{\\infty} \\exp\\left(+\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_{\\infty}$ is the bulk number concentration of each ionic species, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The bulk is electroneutral, so $n_+(\\infty) = n_-(\\infty) = n_{\\infty}$.\n\nSubstituting the Boltzmann distributions for $n_+(x)$ and $n_-(x)$ into the expression for $\\rho(x)$:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = e n_{\\infty} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\sinh(y) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(y) - \\exp(-y))$, the charge density can be written as:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = -2 e n_{\\infty} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into Poisson's equation yields the one-dimensional Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = \\frac{2 e n_{\\infty}}{\\epsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{e\\phi(x)}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve this nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation, we multiply both sides by $2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ and use the identity $2 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)^2\\right)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)^2\\right) = \\frac{4 e n_{\\infty}}{\\epsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)^2 = \\int \\frac{4 e n_{\\infty}}{\\epsilon} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) \\mathrm{d}\\phi = \\frac{4 n_{\\infty} k_B T}{\\epsilon} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T}\\right) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the integration constant.

If the electrode potential $\\psi_0$ is positive, the potential $\\phi(x)$ must decrease from $\\psi_0$ at $x=0$ to $0$ as $x \\to \\infty$, so $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ must be negative. Since $\\sinh(y) > 0$ for $y > 0$, we must choose the negative sign. This choice also works for $\\psi_0 < 0$.

The discontinuity in the normal component of the electric displacement field $\\vec{D} = \\epsilon \\vec{E}$ equals the free surface charge density: $D_x(0^+) - D_x(0^-) = \\sigma$. Since the electric field inside the ideal metal electrode is zero, $D_x(0^-)=0$. Thus, $\\sigma = D_x(0^+) = \\epsilon E_x(0^+) = -\\epsilon \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right)_{x=0}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ and applying the boundary condition $\\phi(0) = \\psi_0$:\n$$\n\\sigma = -\\epsilon \\left[ - \\sqrt{\\frac{8 n_{\\infty} k_B T}{\\epsilon}} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{8 \\epsilon n_{\\infty} k_B T} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the Gouy-Chapman equation for the surface charge density.\n\nNext, we compute the differential capacitance per unit area, $C_d$, defined as $C_d = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\psi_0}$:\n$$\nC_d = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\psi_0} \\left[ \\sqrt{8 \\epsilon n_{\\infty} k_B T} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nPerforming the differentiation with respect to $\\psi_0$:\n$$\nC_d = \\sqrt{8 \\epsilon n_{\\infty} k_B T} \\cdot \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\psi_0}\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_d = \\sqrt{8 \\epsilon n_{\\infty} k_B T} \\cdot \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{e}{2 k_B T}\n$$\nTo simplify the pre-factor, we bring the term $\\frac{e}{2 k_B T}$ inside the square root:\n$$\nC_d = \\sqrt{8 \\epsilon n_{\\infty} k_B T \\cdot \\left(\\frac{e}{2 k_B T}\\right)^2} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_d = \\sqrt{8 \\epsilon n_{\\infty} k_B T \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{4 (k_B T)^2}} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon n_{\\infty} e^2}{k_B T}} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the differential capacitance of the diffuse layer.\n\nFinally, a qualitative analysis of the dependence of $C_d$ on $\\psi_0$ and $n_{\\infty}$ is performed.\n1.  **Dependence on Surface Potential ($\\psi_0$)**: The capacitance $C_d$ depends on $\\psi_0$ through the term $\\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right)$. The hyperbolic cosine function, $\\cosh(y)$, is an even function with its minimum value of $1$ at $y=0$. It increases monotonically as $|y|$ increases. Consequently, $C_d$ is a symmetric function of the surface potential $\\psi_0$, having a minimum value at $\\psi_0=0$. As the magnitude of the potential, $|\\psi_0|$, increases, $C_d$ increases without bound. The plot of $C_d$ versus $\\psi_0$ is a catenary (U-shaped) curve.\n\n2.  **Small-$|\\psi_0|$ Limit**: In the limit of small potential, where $|\\frac{e\\psi_0}{k_B T}| \\ll 1$, we can use the approximation $\\cosh(y) \\approx 1$. The capacitance approaches its minimum value, which is independent of the potential:\n    $$\n    C_{d, \\psi_0 \\to 0} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\epsilon n_{\\infty} e^2}{k_B T}}\n    $$\n    This is the result predicted by the linearized Debye-Hückel theory. This value corresponds to the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with plate separation equal to the Debye length, $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon k_B T}{2 n_\\infty e^2}}$, i.e., $C_{d, \\psi_0 \\to 0} = \\epsilon/\\lambda_D$.\n\n3.  **Monotonicity with $|\\psi_0|$**: For $|\\psi_0| \\geq 0$, the function $\\cosh\\left(\\frac{e\\psi_0}{2 k_B T}\\right)$ is monotonically increasing with $|\\psi_0|$. Since all other terms are positive constants, $C_d$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $|\\psi_0|$ for $|\\psi_0| \\geq 0$.\n\n4.  **Dependence on Bulk Concentration ($n_{\\infty}$)**: The capacitance $C_d$ is proportional to the square root of the bulk ion concentration, $C_d \\propto \\sqrt{n_{\\infty}}$. As the concentration of the electrolyte increases, the capacitance increases. Physically, a higher concentration provides a larger number of ions to screen the electrode's charge, leading to a more compact diffuse layer (smaller Debye length) and thus a larger capacitance.\n\n5.  **Monotonicity with $n_{\\infty}$**: Since $C_d \\propto \\sqrt{n_{\\infty}}$, $C_d$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $n_{\\infty}$ for $n_{\\infty} > 0$.",

The use of Gauss's law and geometric packing principles is fundamental and appropriate. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information ($a$, $e$, ion valency, packing geometry) to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The provided numerical values are physically realistic for hydrated ions. The problem is not trivial, as it requires the synthesis of concepts from electrostatics and geometry. All criteria for a valid problem are met.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds by relating the electrode surface charge density to the maximum possible charge density of a monolayer of counterions, which is constrained by their physical size.\n\nAccording to the principle of local electroneutrality at the interface, the charge on the electrode surface must be balanced by the total charge in the adjacent electrolyte solution. Let the surface charge density of the electrode be $\\sigma$. The problem considers the limit of a very high surface potential, where counterions are strongly attracted to the electrode and form a saturated monolayer at the plane of closest approach. In this limit, the diffuse part of the double layer is considered negligible, and all the screening charge is located within this single monolayer. The magnitude of the maximum surface charge density on the electrode that can be screened by this layer is therefore equal to the magnitude of the total charge per unit area of the counterions in their most compact arrangement. We denote this maximum surface charge density magnitude as $\\sigma_{\\max}$.\n\nThe charge density of the counterion monolayer is the product of the number of ions per unit area, known as the surface number density $N$, and the charge of a single ion. Since the electrolyte is specified as monovalent, each counterion carries a charge of magnitude equal to the elementary charge, $e$. At saturation, the number density reaches its maximum possible value, $N_{\\max}$. Thus, the maximum surface charge density is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} = N_{\\max} \\cdot e\n$$\nThe problem now reduces to determining $N_{\\max}$. The counterions are modeled as hard spheres of diameter $a$. When they form a saturated monolayer, their centers lie in a plane parallel to the electrode. This is a two-dimensional packing problem. The problem states that the maximum density is achieved by a hexagonal packing arrangement, which is the densest possible packing of congruent circles in a plane.\n\nTo find $N_{\\max}$, we must calculate the area occupied by a single ion in this hexagonal lattice. In a hexagonal lattice, we can define a primitive unit cell that, when translated, tiles the entire plane without overlap. This unit cell contains exactly one lattice point (and thus, one ion). A convenient choice for the unit cell is a rhombus whose vertices are the centers of four adjacent ions. The side length of this rhombus is equal to the diameter of the ions, $a$, as adjacent ions are in contact. The interior angles of the rhombus are $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians ($60^\\circ$) and $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians ($120^\\circ$).\n\nThe area of this rhombic unit cell, $A_{\\text{cell}}$, can be calculated as:\n$$\nA_{\\text{cell}} = (\\text{side length})^{2} \\sin(\\text{angle}) = a^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)\n$$\nSince $\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, the area of the unit cell is:\n$$\nA_{\\text{cell}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2\n$$\nThe maximum surface number density, $N_{\\max}$, is the reciprocal of the area per ion:\n$$\nN_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{A_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} a^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $N_{\\max}$ back into the equation for $\\sigma_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} a^2}\\right) e = \\frac{2e}{\\sqrt{3} a^2}\n$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the upper bound of the surface charge density.\n\nNext, we perform the numerical evaluation using the provided values:\n- Ion diameter $a = 0.3\\,\\text{nm} = 0.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$.\n- Elementary charge $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\sigma_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{2 \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C})}{\\sqrt{3} \\times (0.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m})^2}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the denominator:\n$$\n\\sqrt{3} \\times (0.3 \\times 10^{-9})^2 = \\sqrt{3} \\times (0.09 \\times 10^{-18}) \\approx 1.73205 \\times 0.09 \\times 10^{-18} \\approx 0.15588 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\text{m}^2\n$$\nNow, perform the division:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} = \\frac{3.204353268 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}}{0.15588457... \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\text{m}^2} = \\frac{3.204353268}{1.5588457...} \\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} \\approx 2.055613... \\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\max} \\approx 2.06 \\,\\text{C}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\n$$",
