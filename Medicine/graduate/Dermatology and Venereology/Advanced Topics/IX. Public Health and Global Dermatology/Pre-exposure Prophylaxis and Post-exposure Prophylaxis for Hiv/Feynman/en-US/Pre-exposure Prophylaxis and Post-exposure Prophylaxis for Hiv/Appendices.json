There is no evidence of acute kidney injury. Using the Cockcroft–Gault method with the standard female correction factor and using actual body weight, estimate her creatinine clearance (CrCl) in mL/min.

Then define the eligibility indicator $E$ such that $E=1$ if the patient is eligible for daily TDF/FTC PrEP on the basis of the CrCl threshold (that is, CrCl $\\geq 60$ mL/min), and $E=0$ otherwise.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in clinical pharmacology, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its language. The task is a direct application of a standard medical formula, the Cockcroft-Gault equation, to determine a patient's estimated creatinine clearance ($CrCl$) and subsequently decide on their eligibility for a specific medication based on a given threshold.\n\nThe Cockcroft-Gault equation is used to estimate creatinine clearance. The general form of the equation is:\n$$ CrCl = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight}}{72 \\times SCr} $$\nwhere age is in years, weight is in kilograms ($kg$), and a patient's serum creatinine ($SCr$) is in milligrams per deciliter ($mg/dL$).\n\nThe problem specifies that the patient is a cisgender woman, for whom a correction factor of $0.85$ must be applied. The formula thus becomes:\n$$ CrCl_{\\text{female}} = 0.85 \\times \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight}}{72 \\times SCr} $$\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n- Age: $A = 64$ years\n- Actual body weight: $W = 62$ $kg$\n- Serum creatinine: $SCr = 1.1$ $mg/dL$\n\nWe substitute these values into the formula for a female patient:\n$$ CrCl = 0.85 \\times \\frac{(140 - 64) \\times 62}{72 \\times 1.1} $$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:\n$$ 140 - 64 = 76 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator and the denominator of the fraction:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 76 \\times 62 = 4712 $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 72 \\times 1.1 = 79.2 $$\n\nNow, we compute the value of the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{4712}{79.2} \\approx 59.494949... $$\n\nFinally, we apply the female correction factor of $0.85$:\n$$ CrCl = 0.85 \\times 59.494949... \\approx 50.570707... \\text{ mL/min} $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the calculated $CrCl$ to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $5$, $0$, $5$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $0$, so we do not round up.\n$$ CrCl_{\\text{rounded}} = 50.57 \\text{ mL/min} $$\n\nThe next step is to determine the eligibility indicator, $E$. The criteria for $E$ are defined as:\n- $E = 1$ if $CrCl \\geq 60$ $mL/min$\n- $E = 0$ if $CrCl  60$ $mL/min$\n\nWe compare the calculated creatinine clearance, $50.57$ $mL/min$, to the eligibility threshold of $60$ $mL/min$.\n$$ 50.57  60 $$\nSince the patient's estimated $CrCl$ is less than $60$ $mL/min$, she does not meet the specified criterion for initiation of daily tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC).\n\nAccording to the definition provided, if $CrCl  60$ $mL/min$, then the eligibility indicator $E$ is $0$.\nTherefore, $E = 0$.",

            "problem": "A patient in a dermatology and venereology clinic presents after repeated high-risk mucocutaneous sexual exposures to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The standard of care for non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is to initiate antiretroviral therapy as soon as possible within $72$ hours after an exposure and to continue the full course for $28$ consecutive days. When additional exposures occur during an ongoing PEP course, the end date is determined by the last qualifying exposure, such that the PEP course should continue to at least $28$ days after the most recent exposure. Assume perfect adherence once PEP is started and assume all exposures are of equivalent risk.\n\nThe patient’s exposure timeline is as follows (in days, with day $0$ as the time of the first exposure):\n- First exposure at day $0$.\n- Second exposure at day $3.2$.\n- Third exposure at day $16.5$.\n- Fourth exposure at day $27.4$.\n\nThe patient initiates PEP at day $0.75$ after the first exposure.\n\nDefine the cumulative PEP coverage as the ratio\n$$\n\\text{coverage} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{total time receiving PEP within the interval }[0,\\; T_{\\text{last}}+28]}{\\text{length of the interval }[0,\\; T_{\\text{last}}+28]},\n$$\nwhere $T_{\\text{last}}$ is the time (in days) of the last exposure.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established clinical guidelines for HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), provides sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated as a solvable quantitative problem. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires calculating the cumulative PEP coverage for a patient with multiple HIV exposures and explaining the management of the PEP course in terms of restarts versus extensions.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total duration of the PEP course based on the provided timeline and rules.\nLet the times of the four exposures be denoted by $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$, and $T_4$. The given values are:\n- $T_1 = 0$ days\n- $T_2 = 3.2$ days\n- $T_3 = 16.5$ days\n- $T_4 = 27.4$ days\n\nThe patient initiates PEP at time $T_{\\text{start}} = 0.75$ days. This is within the $72$-hour ($3$-day) window following the first exposure at $T_1=0$, as required.\n\nThe core rule is that the PEP course must continue for at least $28$ days after the most recent qualifying exposure. We can track the required end date of the PEP course as each new exposure occurs. Let $T_{\\text{end}}$ be the end date of the PEP course.\n\n1.  **After the first exposure ($T_1=0$):**\n    PEP is initiated at $T_{\\text{start}} = 0.75$. The course must extend for $28$ days beyond this exposure.\n    The initial required end date is $T_{\\text{end},1} = T_1 + 28 = 0 + 28 = 28$ days.\n    The PEP course is scheduled to run over the interval $[0.75, 28]$.\n\n2.  **After the second exposure ($T_2=3.2$):**\n    This exposure occurs at day $3.2$. At this time, the patient is actively taking PEP, since $T_{\\text{start}} = 0.75  T_2 = 3.2  T_{\\text{end},1} = 28$.\n    Because the patient is already on PEP, no restart is necessary. Instead, the course duration is extended. The new required end date is $28$ days after this most recent exposure.\n    The new end date is $T_{\\text{end},2} = T_2 + 28 = 3.2 + 28 = 31.2$ days.\n    The PEP course is now scheduled to run over the interval $[0.75, 31.2]$.\n\n3.  **After the third exposure ($T_3=16.5$):**\n    This exposure occurs at day $16.5$. The patient is still on PEP, as $0.75  16.5  31.2$.\n    The course end date is again extended to be $28$ days after this exposure.\n    The new end date is $T_{\\text{end},3} = T_3 + 28 = 16.5 + 28 = 44.5$ days.\n    The PEP course is now scheduled to run over the interval $[0.75, 44.5]$.\n\n4.  **After the fourth exposure ($T_4=27.4$):**\n    This exposure occurs at day $27.4$. The patient is still on PEP, as $0.75  27.4  44.5$.\n    The final end date must be $28$ days after this last exposure.\n    The final end date is $T_{\\text{end}} = T_4 + 28 = 27.4 + 28 = 55.4$ days.\n    The complete PEP treatment interval is therefore $[T_{\\text{start}}, T_{\\text{end}}] = [0.75, 55.4]$.\n\nRegarding the requirement to explain whether restarts are needed, the analysis above provides the answer. A \"restart\" implies stopping and then starting a new course of PEP, which would typically be relevant if an exposure occurred after a previous PEP course was completed. In this case, each subsequent exposure ($T_2, T_3, T_4$) occurred while the patient was already on a continuous, ongoing course of PEP. Therefore, no restarts were required. The management consists solely of extending the end date of the single, continuous PEP course to ensure it lasts $28$ days past the final exposure.\n\nNext, we calculate the cumulative PEP coverage. The formula is given as:\n$$\n\\text{coverage} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{total time receiving PEP within the interval }[0,\\; T_{\\text{last}}+28]}{\\text{length of the interval }[0,\\; T_{\\text{last}}+28]}\n$$\nThe time of the last exposure is $T_{\\text{last}} = T_4 = 27.4$ days.\n\nThe evaluation interval is $[0, T_{\\text{last}}+28]$.\nThe end of this interval is $T_{\\text{last}} + 28 = 27.4 + 28 = 55.4$ days.\nSo, the evaluation interval is $[0, 55.4]$.\nThe length of this interval is $55.4 - 0 = 55.4$ days.\n\nThe total time the patient received PEP is the duration of the treatment interval, which we determined to be $[0.75, 55.4]$.\nThe duration of PEP is $T_{\\text{end}} - T_{\\text{start}} = 55.4 - 0.75 = 54.65$ days.\n\nThe PEP treatment interval $[0.75, 55.4]$ is fully contained within the evaluation interval $[0, 55.4]$. Therefore, the total time receiving PEP within the evaluation interval is simply the duration of the PEP course itself.\n\nNow, we can compute the coverage ratio:\n$$\n\\text{coverage} = \\frac{\\text{Duration of PEP}}{\\text{Length of evaluation interval}} = \\frac{54.65}{55.4}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\text{coverage} \\approx 0.9864620938...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $8$, $6$, and $4$. The fifth significant digit is $6$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\text{coverage} \\approx 0.9865\n$$\nThus, the cumulative PEP coverage is $0.9865$.",
