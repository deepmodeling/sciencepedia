            "problem": "A dermatologist is comparing High-Frequency Ultrasound (HFUS) to Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) for axial delineation of epidermal and dermal structures. For HFUS, the axial resolution depends on the emitted pulse’s temporal support and the system’s sensing bandwidth.\n\nDefine the following HFUS quantities rigorously within the context of a linear, time-invariant pulse-echo system:\n\n- The center frequency $f_{0}$ of the transducer.\n- The $-6$ dB bandwidth $BW$ of the system.\n- The temporal pulse length $\\tau$ of the emitted acoustic pressure envelope.\n\nThen, starting only from the definitions above, the two-way propagation of echoes along the beam axis, and the Fourier time–frequency uncertainty principle that links finite-duration pulses to finite spectral support, derive an expression for the axial resolution $\\delta z$ in terms of the speed of sound $c$ in tissue and the system bandwidth $BW$.\n\nFinally, assume a transducer with $f_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ and fractional bandwidth $F = \\frac{BW}{f_{0}} = 0.50$. Take the speed of sound in dermal soft tissue to be $c = 1{,}540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. Evaluate the axial resolution $\\delta z$ for these parameters. Express your final numerical answer in micrometers and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "In a linear, time-invariant pulse-echo HFUS system, the key spectral and temporal quantities are defined as follows:\n\n- The center frequency $f_{0}$ characterizes the transducer’s operating band. Operationally, $f_{0}$ can be defined as the frequency at which the magnitude of the system transfer function $|H(f)|$ attains its maximum, or equivalently as the spectral centroid,\n$$\nf_{0} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f\\,|H(f)|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}f}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} |H(f)|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}f}.\n$$\n- The $-6$ dB bandwidth $BW$ is the width of the frequency interval over which the magnitude response remains within $6$ dB of its peak, i.e., if $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are the lower and upper $-6$ dB cutoff frequencies, then\n$$\nBW = f_{2} - f_{1}.\n$$\nThe fractional bandwidth is $F = \\frac{BW}{f_{0}}$.\n- The temporal pulse length $\\tau$ is the effective duration of the emitted acoustic pressure envelope $p(t)$, which can be quantified, for example, by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the envelope or of the matched-filtered autocorrelation. It represents the shortest time scale over which the system can discriminate two echoes.\n\nTo connect axial resolution to these definitions, consider two point reflectors located along the beam axis at depths $z$ and $z + \\Delta z$. In pulse-echo ultrasound, the round-trip travel time difference between echoes from these two reflectors is\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{2\\,\\Delta z}{c},\n$$\nbecause the acoustic wave traverses the separation $\\Delta z$ twice (forward and back) at speed $c$.\n\nResolution requires that the system can distinguish two echoes without excessive overlap of their impulse responses. A standard criterion is that the time separation between the echoes must be on the order of at least the effective pulse length, i.e.,\n$$\n\\Delta t \\approx \\tau.\n$$\nUnder this criterion, the axial resolution $\\delta z$ (the minimal separable axial distance) satisfies\n$$\n\\delta z \\approx \\frac{c\\,\\tau}{2}.\n$$\n\nWe now relate $\\tau$ to the system bandwidth $BW$ using the time–frequency uncertainty principle. For any finite-energy waveform, there is a lower bound on the product of its temporal width and spectral width (Wiener–Heisenberg uncertainty). When temporal and spectral widths are measured using consistent width metrics (e.g., second moments or FWHM), a band-limited signal occupying a bandwidth $BW$ necessarily has an effective duration on the order of the inverse bandwidth. In engineering practice for HFUS pulses shaped and detected with matched filtering, this leads to the approximation\n$$\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{1}{BW}.\n$$\nThis expresses the intuitive and mathematically grounded fact that shorter pulses require broader spectral support.\n\nSubstituting $\\tau \\approx \\frac{1}{BW}$ into $\\delta z \\approx \\frac{c\\,\\tau}{2}$ yields\n$$\n\\delta z \\approx \\frac{c}{2\\,BW}.\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate $\\delta z$ for the given transducer parameters. The center frequency is $f_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$ and the fractional bandwidth is $F = \\frac{BW}{f_{0}} = 0.50$, so\n$$\nBW = F\\,f_{0} = 0.50 \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 10\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 10 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}.\n$$\nWith $c = 1{,}540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, the axial resolution is\n$$\n\\delta z \\approx \\frac{c}{2\\,BW} = \\frac{1{,}540\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{2 \\times 10 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}\n= \\frac{1{,}540}{20 \\times 10^{6}}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n= 7.7 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}.\n$$\nExpressed in micrometers ($1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$),\n$$\n\\delta z = 7.7 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 77\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}.\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the numerical value is $77.0\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$.",

            "introduction": "While high resolution is essential, an image is only as good as its signal quality at all depths. In biological tissues, ultrasound signals weaken significantly as they travel deeper, a phenomenon known as attenuation. This exercise introduces Time-Gain Compensation (TGC), a critical technique used to counteract this effect, and challenges you to design a gain function that equalizes echo amplitudes, ensuring that deep structures are as visible as superficial ones .",

            "problem": "A high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) skin scanner in dermatology and venereology uses Time-Gain Compensation (TGC) to correct for depth-dependent attenuation so that the mean envelope of backscattered echo amplitudes appears uniform with depth.

Express the final gain as a dimensionless number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive the depth-dependent gain law $G(z)$ for a Time-Gain Compensation (TGC) system and then compute its value at a specific depth $z$. The purpose of TGC is to counteract the depth-dependent attenuation of the ultrasound signal, ensuring that echoes from equally reflective targets at different depths produce signals of equal mean amplitude.\n\nFirst, we model the received echo amplitude $A_{rx}(z)$ from a scatterer at depth $z$. The ultrasound pulse travels to the scatterer and then back to the transducer, traversing a total path length of $2z$. Based on the provided foundational fact of exponential attenuation, the amplitude of the received signal is given by:\n$$\nA_{rx}(z) = A_0 \\exp(-2 \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Np}} z)\n$$\nwhere $A_0$ is a constant that incorporates the initial transmitted amplitude and the backscattering strength of the tissue (assumed to be uniform with depth), and $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Np}}$ is the amplitude attenuation coefficient of the medium in units of Nepers per unit length (e.g., $\\mathrm{Np}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$).\n\nThe TGC system applies a gain $G(z)$ to the received signal. The compensated signal amplitude, $A_{comp}(z)$, is the product of the gain and the received amplitude:\n$$\nA_{comp}(z) = G(z) A_{rx}(z)\n$$\nFor the mean envelope of the backscattered echo amplitudes to appear uniform with depth, $A_{comp}(z)$ must be constant. We can set this constant to be $A_0$, the hypothetical amplitude from a scatterer at zero depth.\n$$\nG(z) \\left( A_0 \\exp(-2 \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Np}} z) \\right) = A_0\n$$\nSolving for the gain $G(z)$, we find the gain law that perfectly compensates for the attenuation:\n$$\nG(z) = \\frac{A_0}{A_0 \\exp(-2 \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Np}} z)} = \\exp(2 \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Np}} z)\n$$\nThis expression gives the required gain as a dimensionless amplification factor.\n\nNext, we must relate the attenuation coefficient in Nepers, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Np}}$, to the empirically given value, $\\alpha_0$. The problem provides the relationship between an amplitude ratio and its level in decibels ($\\mathrm{dB}$). The attenuation in $\\mathrm{dB}$ over a path length $L$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{Attenuation (dB)} = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A(0)}{A(L)}\\right)\n$$\nFrom the exponential attenuation law, the amplitude ratio is $\\frac{A(0)}{A(L)} = \\frac{A(0)}{A(0)\\exp(-\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Np}} L)} = \\exp(\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Np}} L)$.

To maintain consistent units with $\\alpha_0$, we convert the depth to centimeters: $z = 8\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nNow, we substitute all the numerical values into the exponent of the gain function:\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = \\frac{\\alpha_0 f z}{10} = \\frac{(0.8\\,\\mathrm{dB}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{MHz}^{-1}) \\times (20\\,\\mathrm{MHz}) \\times (0.8\\,\\mathrm{cm})}{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Exponent} = \\frac{0.8 \\times 20 \\times 0.8}{10} = \\frac{12.8}{10} = 1.28\n$$\nThe required TGC gain is therefore:\n$$\nG(z = 8\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 10^{1.28}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n10^{1.28} \\approx 19.054607...\n$$\nRounding the answer to four significant figures, we get $19.05$.",
