            "problem": "A sunscreen is characterized both in vitro by spectrophotometry and in vivo by its ability to delay erythema under solar ultraviolet radiation. Consider the following scientifically grounded approximations used in photoprotection measurement science:\n\n1. The erythemally weighted effective irradiance at the skin surface is the spectral integral of the incident spectral irradiance weighted by the biological action spectrum and modified by any spectral transmittance at the surface. If $E(\\lambda)$ denotes the incident spectral irradiance, $S(\\lambda)$ denotes the erythema action spectrum weighting, and $T(\\lambda)$ denotes the spectral transmittance of the applied sunscreen film, then the erythemally weighted irradiance at the skin is\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{ery}}=\\int_{\\lambda_{\\min}}^{\\lambda_{\\max}} E(\\lambda)\\,S(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda.\n$$\n\n2.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The problem statement provides a set of definitions and simplified models from the field of photoprotection science. These include the definitions for erythemally weighted irradiance $E_{\\mathrm{ery}}$, time to minimal erythema $t$, and Sun Protection Factor (SPF). It provides functional forms for the incident solar spectrum $E(\\lambda)$, the erythema action spectrum $S(\\lambda)$, and the sunscreen's spectral transmittance $T(\\lambda)$. All provided physical quantities, parameters, and constants are clearly defined with consistent units. The models, while being approximations, are based on established scientific principles like the Beer-Lambert law. The problem is thus deemed valid and solvable.\n\nThe Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is defined as the ratio of the time to reach minimal erythema with sunscreen applied, $t_{\\mathrm{with}}$, to the time without sunscreen, $t_{\\mathrm{without}}$, under identical illumination conditions:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF} = \\frac{t_{\\mathrm{with}}}{t_{\\mathrm{without}}} $$\nThe time to reach the minimal erythema dose threshold, $H^{\\star}$, is given by $t = H^{\\star}/E_{\\mathrm{ery}}$. Since $H^{\\star}$ is an intrinsic property of the skin and is constant for the test, the SPF can be expressed in terms of the erythemally weighted irradiances:\n$$ \\mathrm{SPF} = \\frac{H^{\\star}/E_{\\mathrm{ery, with}}}{H^{\\star}/E_{\\mathrm{ery, without}}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{ery, without}}}{E_{\\mathrm{ery, with}}} $$\nThe erythemally weighted irradiance is given by the integral:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{ery}} = \\int_{\\lambda_{\\min}}^{\\lambda_{\\max}} E(\\lambda)\\,S(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the erythemally weighted irradiance on unprotected skin, $E_{\\mathrm{ery, without}}$, for which the transmittance is $T(\\lambda) = 1$. The incident spectral irradiance is given as $E(\\lambda) = E_0$ (a constant) and the erythema action spectrum as $S(\\lambda) = \\exp(\\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda))$ over the range $[\\lambda_{\\min}, \\lambda_{\\max}]$.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{ery, without}} = \\int_{\\lambda_{\\min}}^{\\lambda_{\\max}} E_0 \\exp(\\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda)) (1) \\,d\\lambda $$\nGiven that $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\lambda_0$, the integral is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{ery, without}} = E_0 \\int_{\\lambda_{\\min}}^{\\lambda_0} \\exp(\\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda)) \\,d\\lambda $$\nTo solve this integral, we use the substitution $u = \\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda)$, which gives $du = -\\sigma\\,d\\lambda$. The limits of integration change from $\\lambda = \\lambda_{\\min}$ to $u = \\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_{\\min})$, and from $\\lambda = \\lambda_0$ to $u = 0$.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{ery, without}} = E_0 \\int_{\\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_{\\min})}^{0} e^u \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\right) \\,du = \\frac{E_0}{\\sigma} \\int_{0}^{\\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_{\\min})} e^u \\,du $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{ery, without}} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sigma} \\left[ e^u \\right]_{0}^{\\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_{\\min})} = \\frac{E_0}{\\sigma} \\left( \\exp(\\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_{\\min})) - 1 \\right) $$\n\nNext, we calculate the erythemally weighted irradiance on protected skin, $E_{\\mathrm{ery, with}}$. The sunscreen's transmittance is given by $T(\\lambda) = \\exp(-m\\,K(\\lambda))$, with $K(\\lambda) = \\kappa(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda)$. Thus, $T(\\lambda) = \\exp(-m\\kappa(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda))$.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{ery, with}} = \\int_{\\lambda_{\\min}}^{\\lambda_{\\max}} E(\\lambda)\\,S(\\lambda)\\,T(\\lambda)\\,d\\lambda = \\int_{\\lambda_{\\min}}^{\\lambda_0} E_0 \\exp(\\sigma(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda)) \\exp(-m\\kappa(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda)) \\,d\\lambda $$\nThe exponents can be combined:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{ery, with}} = E_0 \\int_{\\lambda_{\\min}}^{\\lambda_0} \\exp((\\sigma - m\\kappa)(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda)) \\,d\\lambda $$\nThis integral has the same form as the previous one, with $\\sigma$ replaced by $(\\sigma - m\\kappa)$.

The use of the Beer-Lambert law for light attenuation is a fundamental principle in physics and chemistry. The modeling of sunscreen film heterogeneity with a gamma distribution is a standard and validated approach in the field of photobiology and dermatology. The concept of SPF being related to the inverse of the average transmittance is also a standard definition under the assumption of uniform erythemally weighted incident irradiance. The provided numerical values for dose, removal fraction, and mass absorption coefficient are physically realistic. The problem specifies all necessary parameters and relationships, contains no contradictions, and is mathematically formalizable. It is not trivial, as it requires a correct application of probability theory concerning functions of random variables and their statistical moments.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe monochromatic Sun Protection Factor at the representative wavelength $\\lambda_{\\ast}$, denoted $\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\ast}$, is given by the reciprocal of the area-averaged monochromatic transmittance $\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle$. The area average is equivalent to the statistical expectation over the distribution of the local mass per unit area.\n\nThe total local mass per unit area after reapplication, $M_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is given by the random variable:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{tot}} = (1-r)\\,M_{1} + M_{2}$$\nwhere $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are independent random variables representing the mass distributions from the initial application and reapplication, respectively.\n\nThe monochromatic transmittance at a point with mass $m$ is $T_{\\ast}(m) = \\exp(-k_{\\ast} m)$. The area-averaged transmittance is the expected value of this function over the distribution of $M_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = E\\left[\\exp(-k_{\\ast} M_{\\mathrm{tot}})\\right] = E\\left[\\exp\\left(-k_{\\ast}((1-r)M_{1} + M_{2})\\right)\\right]$$\nUsing the properties of exponents, we can write:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = E\\left[\\exp(-k_{\\ast}(1-r)M_{1}) \\cdot \\exp(-k_{\\ast}M_{2})\\right]$$\nSince $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are independent random variables, the expectation of the product of functions of these variables is the product of their individual expectations:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = E\\left[\\exp(-k_{\\ast}(1-r)M_{1})\\right] \\cdot E\\left[\\exp(-k_{\\ast}M_{2})\\right]$$\nThis expression involves the moment-generating function (MGF) of the random variables $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$. The MGF of a random variable $X$ is defined as $M_X(t) = E[\\exp(tX)]$.\nThus, we can write:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = M_{M_1}(-k_{\\ast}(1-r)) \\cdot M_{M_2}(-k_{\\ast})$$\nWe must first determine the parameters of the gamma distributions for $M_1$ and $M_2$. A random variable $X$ following a gamma distribution with shape parameter $\\alpha$ and scale parameter $\\theta$, denoted $X \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\theta)$, has a mean $E[X] = \\alpha\\theta$, variance $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\alpha\\theta^2$, and MGF $M_X(t) = (1-\\theta t)^{-\\alpha}$. The coefficient of variation is $\\mathrm{CV} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}/E[X] = \\sqrt{\\alpha\\theta^2}/(\\alpha\\theta) = 1/\\sqrt{\\alpha}$.\n\nFor the initial application layer $M_{1}$:\n- Mean: $E[M_{1}] = \\alpha_{1}\\theta_{1} = D_{1} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$\n- Coefficient of variation: $\\mathrm{CV}_{1} = 1/\\sqrt{\\alpha_{1}} = 0.5$\nFrom the CV, we find the shape parameter $\\alpha_{1}$:\n$$\\sqrt{\\alpha_{1}} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \\implies \\alpha_{1} = 4$$\nNow, we find the scale parameter $\\theta_{1}$:\n$$\\theta_{1} = \\frac{E[M_{1}]}{\\alpha_{1}} = \\frac{1.0}{4} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$$\nSo, $M_{1} \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(\\alpha_{1}=4, \\theta_{1}=0.25)$. The MGF of $M_{1}$ is $M_{M_1}(t) = (1-0.25t)^{-4}$.\n\nFor the reapplication layer $M_{2}$:\n- Mean: $E[M_{2}] = \\alpha_{2}\\theta_{2} = D_{2} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$\n- Coefficient of variation: $\\mathrm{CV}_{2} = 1/\\sqrt{\\alpha_{2}} = 0.5$\nFrom the CV, we find the shape parameter $\\alpha_{2}$:\n$$\\sqrt{\\alpha_{2}} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \\implies \\alpha_{2} = 4$$\nAnd the scale parameter $\\theta_{2}$ is:\n$$\\theta_{2} = \\frac{E[M_{2}]}{\\alpha_{2}} = \\frac{0.50}{4} = 0.125\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$$\nSo, $M_{2} \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(\\alpha_{2}=4, \\theta_{2}=0.125)$. The MGF of $M_{2}$ is $M_{M_2}(t) = (1-0.125t)^{-4}$.\n\nNow we can evaluate the two terms for the average transmittance.\nFirst term, for $M_1$: The argument for the MGF is $t_1 = -k_{\\ast}(1-r)$.\nGiven $k_{\\ast} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}$ and $r = 0.40$, so $1-r = 0.60$.\n$$t_1 = -3.0 \\times 0.60 = -1.8$$\n$$M_{M_1}(-1.8) = (1 - 0.25 \\times (-1.8))^{-4} = (1 + 0.45)^{-4} = (1.45)^{-4}$$\n\nSecond term, for $M_2$: The argument for the MGF is $t_2 = -k_{\\ast} = -3.0$.\n$$M_{M_2}(-3.0) = (1 - 0.125 \\times (-3.0))^{-4} = (1 + 0.375)^{-4} = (1.375)^{-4}$$\n\nNow, we compute the total average transmittance $\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = M_{M_1}(-1.8) \\cdot M_{M_2}(-3.0) = (1.45)^{-4} \\cdot (1.375)^{-4}$$\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = (1.45 \\times 1.375)^{-4}$$\nLet's compute the product in the base:\n$$1.45 \\times 1.375 = 1.99375$$\nSo, the average transmittance is:\n$$\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle = (1.99375)^{-4}$$\n\nFinally, the monochromatic SPF is the reciprocal of the average transmittance:\n$$\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{\\langle T_{\\ast} \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{(1.99375)^{-4}} = (1.99375)^{4}$$\nWe now calculate the numerical value:\n$$\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\ast} = (1.99375)^{4} \\approx 15.8009365$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\mathrm{SPF}_{\\ast} \\approx 15.80$$",

            "solution": "The posed problem is a constrained optimization task concerning the design of a sunscreen formulation. The objective is to minimize transdermal erythemally weighted UV radiation by selecting an optimal subset from a given collection of UV filters, subject to budgetary, broad-spectrum efficacy, and UVA protection constraints. The problem is grounded in the fundamental principles of photobiology and spectroscopy, and its solution requires a systematic computational approach.\n\nThe model is defined over a discrete wavelength grid, $\\lambda_k \\in \\{290, 291, \\dots, 400\\}$ nm, with a uniform spacing of $\\Delta\\lambda = 1$ nm.\n\nFirst, the optical properties of the sunscreen are modeled using the Beer–Lambert law. This law states that the spectral transmittance, $T(\\lambda)$, which is the fraction of incident light at a given wavelength $\\lambda$ that passes through the medium, decays exponentially with the medium's absorbance, $A(\\lambda)$. The relationship is given by:\n$$\nT(\\lambda) = e^{-A_{\\text{total}}(\\lambda)}\n$$\nThe total absorbance, $A_{\\text{total}}(\\lambda)$, is the linear superposition of the contributions from each selected UV filter. For a set of $N=5$ available filters, the selection is represented by binary variables $c_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $c_i=1$ signifies inclusion and $c_i=0$ signifies exclusion. Each filter $i$ possesses a characteristic absorbance profile $A_i(\\lambda)$ and a photostability factor $s_i \\in (0, 1]$. The total absorbance is thus:\n$$\nA_{\\text{total}}(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^5 c_i s_i A_i(\\lambda)\n$$\nThe intrinsic absorbance $A_i(\\lambda)$ of each filter is modeled as a Gaussian function superimposed on a constant baseline, a common approximation for molecular absorption spectra:\n$$\nA_i(\\lambda) = \\alpha_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\lambda-\\mu_i)^2}{2\\sigma_i^2}\\right) + \\beta_i\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_i$ is the peak absorption wavelength, $\\sigma_i$ is the peak width, $\\alpha_i$ is the peak height, and $\\beta_i$ is the baseline absorbance.\n\nThe biological effectiveness of the transmitted UV radiation is evaluated using standardized weighting functions. The incident solar radiation is modeled by a spectral irradiance function, $S(\\lambda)$. The potential for this radiation to cause erythema (sunburn) is quantified by the McKinlay-Diffey erythema action spectrum, $W_{\\mathrm{e}}(\\lambda)$. Both $S(\\lambda)$ and $W_{\\mathrm{e}}(\\lambda)$ are defined by piecewise functions as specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe primary objective is to minimize the erythemally weighted dose fraction, $F_{\\mathrm{e}}$, defined as the ratio of the total erythemally effective dose transmitted through the sunscreen to the total incident erythemally effective dose. This dimensionless quantity is calculated by integrating the product of the relevant spectra over the UV range:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{e}} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\lambda=290}^{400} S(\\lambda) W_{\\mathrm{e}}(\\lambda) T(\\lambda) \\Delta\\lambda}{\\sum_{\\lambda=290}^{400} S(\\lambda) W_{\\mathrm{e}}(\\lambda) \\Delta\\lambda}\n$$\nSince $\\Delta\\lambda=1$ nm, it can be omitted from the ratio calculation. Minimizing $F_{\\mathrm{e}}$ corresponds to maximizing protection against sunburn.\n\nThis minimization is subject to three constraints:\n1.  **Budget Constraint**: The total cost of the selected filters must not exceed a given budget $B$.\n    $$\n    \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\text{cost}_i c_i \\le B\n    $$\n2.  **Broad-Spectrum Constraint**: The formulation must provide adequate protection across both UVB and UVA regions. This is quantified by the critical wavelength, $\\lambda_c$, which must be greater than or equal to a minimum value $\\lambda_c^{\\min}$. The critical wavelength is defined as the wavelength at which $90\\%$ of the total integrated absorbance from $290$ nm is achieved:\n    $$\n    \\lambda_c = \\min\\left\\{\\lambda \\in [290,400]: \\frac{\\int_{290}^{\\lambda} A_{\\text{total}}(\\xi) d\\xi}{\\int_{290}^{400} A_{\\text{total}}(\\xi) d\\xi} \\ge 0.9\\right\\}\n    $$\n    Numerically, this integral is computed as a cumulative sum over the discrete wavelength grid.\n3.  **UVA Protection Constraint**: The fraction of incident UVA light transmitted through the sunscreen, $F_{\\mathrm{UVA}}$, must not exceed a maximum value $F_{\\mathrm{UVA}}^{\\max}$. This is defined over the UVA range ($\\lambda \\ge 320$ nm) as:\n    $$\n    F_{\\mathrm{UVA}} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\lambda=320}^{400} S(\\lambda) T(\\lambda) \\Delta\\lambda}{\\sum_{\\lambda=320}^{400} S(\\lambda) \\Delta\\lambda}\n    $$\n\nThe optimization is performed using an exhaustive search algorithm. Since there are only $5$ filters, the total number of possible combinations is $2^5 = 32$, which is computationally manageable. The algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case:\n1.  Initialize the minimum erythemally weighted dose fraction, $\\min(F_{\\mathrm{e}})$, to $1.0$. This value corresponds to no protection ($T(\\lambda)=1$ for all $\\lambda$) and is the default result if no combination satisfies the constraints.\n2.  Iterate through all $32$ binary combinations $(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5)$.\n3.  For each combination, check if it is a feasible solution by sequentially evaluating the constraints:\n    a. Verify that the total cost is within the budget $B$.\n    b. If the cost is acceptable, calculate the total absorbance $A_{\\text{total}}(\\lambda)$ and from it, the critical wavelength $\\lambda_c$. Verify that $\\lambda_c \\ge \\lambda_c^{\\min}$.\n    c. If $\\lambda_c$ is acceptable, calculate the spectral transmittance $T(\\lambda)$ and the UVA transmittance fraction $F_{\\mathrm{UVA}}$. Verify that $F_{\\mathrm{UVA}} \\le F_{\\mathrm{UVA}}^{\\max}$.\n4.  If a combination satisfies all three constraints, it is deemed feasible. The corresponding $F_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is calculated.\n5.  This $F_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is compared with the current $\\min(F_{\\mathrm{e}})$, and if it is smaller, $\\min(F_{\\mathrm{e}})$ is updated.\n6.  After evaluating all $32$ combinations, the final $\\min(F_{\\mathrm{e}})$ value for the test case is recorded.\n\nThis systematic process guarantees finding the globally optimal filter combination within the defined model and constraints. The calculations are vectorized using the NumPy library for efficiency.",
