            "introduction": "At the heart of every phototherapy session lies a fundamental radiometric principle. This exercise grounds you in the essential calculation of converting a prescribed radiant exposure, or dose ($H_e$), into a precise exposure time ($t$) based on the measured irradiance ($E_e$) of the equipment. Mastering this conversion from first principles, as detailed in , is the first step toward safe and effective treatment administration, emphasizing the importance of correct unit handling and conservative rounding policies.",

            "problem": "A narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy booth designed for dermatologic treatment delivers a spatially uniform, temporally steady irradiance at the patient plane. For this session, the calibrated beam-averaged irradiance is $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ measured at the skin surface under treatment, and a physician-prescribed target radiant exposure (dose) is $300\\,\\mathrm{mJ}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Using only first principles of radiometry and the core definitions of irradiance and radiant exposure, derive the expression that relates the required exposure time to the irradiance and the target radiant exposure under the assumption of temporal constancy of the irradiance. Then compute the exposure time numerically with correct unit handling. As a safety-critical device, the console accepts time setpoints in seconds only; in clinical phototherapy it is customary to avoid exceeding the prescribed radiant exposure. Therefore, after obtaining the exact value, apply a conservative rounding policy that does not increase the delivered radiant exposure relative to the exact calculation and round your final result to three significant figures. Express the final time in $\\mathrm{s}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following quantities and conditions are explicitly provided in the problem statement:\n-   Calibrated beam-averaged irradiance: $E_e = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$\n-   Physician-prescribed target radiant exposure (dose): $H_e = 300\\,\\mathrm{mJ}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$\n-   Assumption 1: The irradiance is spatially uniform at the patient plane.\n-   Assumption 2: The irradiance is temporally steady (constant in time).\n-   Constraint 1: The final exposure time must be expressed in seconds ($s$).\n-   Constraint 2: The final numerical result must be rounded to three significant figures.\n-   Constraint 3: The rounding policy must be conservative, such that the delivered radiant exposure does not exceed the prescribed target. This implies that the set exposure time must be less than or equal to the time calculated exactly.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based entirely on the fundamental principles of radiometry, a branch of optics and physics. The quantities of irradiance and radiant exposure, and their relationship through time, are core concepts. The given values are clinically realistic for narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy. The problem is sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary information is provided. The assumption of constant irradiance simplifies the relationship between the given quantities and the unknown (time) into a solvable algebraic equation. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists. The problem is well-posed.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, standard scientific terminology. There is no subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is computationally and scientifically valid. It is well-posed, grounded in established physical principles, and uses realistic parameters. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution is derived from the first principles of radiometry.\n\n1.  **Definition of Irradiance:** Irradiance, denoted by $E_e$, is defined as the radiant flux ($d\\Phi_e$) incident on a surface element, divided by the area ($dA$) of that element. Radiant flux is the radiant energy ($dQ_e$) per unit time ($dt$). Thus, irradiance is the power per unit area.\n    $$E_e = \\frac{d\\Phi_e}{dA} = \\frac{d}{dA}\\left(\\frac{dQ_e}{dt}\\right)$$\n    For a spatially uniform beam, the irradiance is constant across the area of interest.\n\n2.  **Definition of Radiant Exposure:** Radiant exposure, denoted by $H_e$, is defined as the total radiant energy ($Q_e$) incident on a surface per unit area ($A$). It is the time integral of the irradiance over a specified duration.\n    $$H_e = \\frac{dQ_e}{dA} = \\int_{0}^{t} E_e(t') dt'$$\n    where $t'$ is the variable of integration over the exposure time interval from $0$ to $t$.\n\n3.  **Application of Problem Conditions:** The problem states that the irradiance is temporally steady, meaning $E_e(t')$ is a constant. Let this constant irradiance be $E_0$. The integral simplifies significantly:\n    $$H_e = \\int_{0}^{t} E_0 dt' = E_0 \\int_{0}^{t} dt' = E_0 [t']_{0}^{t} = E_0 (t - 0)$$\n    $$H_e = E_0 \\cdot t$$\n\n4.  **Derivation of the Expression for Time:** To find the required exposure time, $t$, we rearrange the equation derived above:\n    $$t = \\frac{H_e}{E_0}$$\n    This expression relates the exposure time ($t$) to the target radiant exposure ($H_e$) and the constant irradiance ($E_0$).\n\n### Numerical Computation\nNext, the numerical value for the exposure time is computed using the derived expression and the given data.\n\n1.  **Given Values:**\n    -   Irradiance, $E_0 = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$\n    -   Radiant Exposure, $H_e = 300\\,\\mathrm{mJ}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$\n\n2.  **Unit Consistency:** For the calculation, units must be consistent. The unit of power, the watt ($W$), is equivalent to one joule per second ($1\\,\\mathrm{W} = 1\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Therefore, the milliwatt ($mW$) is one millijoule per second ($1\\,\\mathrm{mW} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mJ}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). We can express the irradiance in terms of millijoules to match the units of radiant exposure.\n    $$E_0 = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mW}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mJ}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$$\n\n3.  **Calculation of Exposure Time:** Substituting the numerical values into the derived formula:\n    $$t = \\frac{H_e}{E_0} = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{mJ}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}}{1.5\\,\\mathrm{mJ}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}}$$\n    The units of $\\mathrm{mJ}$ and $\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ cancel, leaving the unit of time, seconds ($s$), in the numerator, as expected.\n    $$t = \\frac{300}{1.5}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 200\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n    The exact exposure time required to deliver the prescribed dose is $200\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n### Application of Rounding Policy\nThe problem requires that the final result be rounded according to a conservative policy and expressed to three significant figures.\n\n1.  **Conservative Rounding:** The policy requires that the delivered dose does not exceed the target. The delivered dose is $H_{e, \\text{delivered}} = E_0 \\cdot t_{\\text{set}}$, where $t_{\\text{set}}$ is the time entered into the machine. The condition is $H_{e, \\text{delivered}} \\le H_e$, which implies $E_0 \\cdot t_{\\text{set}} \\le E_0 \\cdot t_{\\text{exact}}$. Since $E_0 > 0$, this requires $t_{\\text{set}} \\le t_{\\text{exact}}$. This means any rounding must be a truncation (rounding down) to ensure the delivered dose is not higher than prescribed.\n\n2.  **Rounding to Three Significant Figures:** The exact calculated time is $t_{\\text{exact}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{s}$. This is an integer value. We must round this result to three significant figures. The number $200$ can be represented as $2.00 \\times 10^2$ to unambiguously show three significant figures. Applying the truncation policy to the exact value of $200.000...$ results in $200$. Since the value is exact and does not require truncation, and its standard representation is an integer, the final numerical value is $200$.\n\nThe final answer is therefore $200$.",

            "problem": "A patient is scheduled for ultraviolet A (UVA) phototherapy in a full-body booth.

It is based on established principles of phototherapy and can be formalized into a solvable system of linear equations. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\nThe relationship between dose ($D$), irradiance ($E$), and exposure time ($t$) is given by the integral formulation $D = \\int E(t)\\,dt$. Since the irradiance is constant during each orientation period, this simplifies to a sum over the discrete orientations. The total dose for a given skin region is the sum of the partial doses received during each of the four orientations:\n$$D_{\\text{region}} = \\sum_{j \\in \\{F, R, B, L^{\\ast}\\}} E_{\\text{region}, j} \\cdot t_j$$\nwhere $t_j$ is the time spent in orientation $j$.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in applied physics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe delivered radiant exposure (dose), $H$, is the product of the effective irradiance, $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, and the exposure time, $t$. The timer uncertainty is negligible, so we use the setpoint time $t_{\\mathrm{set}}$. The effective irradiance is influenced by several independent factors: calibration, short-term variability, lamp aging, and patient positioning.\n\nWe can construct a model for the delivered dose $H$ as a product of the nominal dose $H_{\\mathrm{target}}$ and several multiplicative correction factors, each with an expected value of $1$.\n$$H = H_{\\mathrm{target}} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{cal}} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{var}} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{age}} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{pos}}$$\nHere, $H_{\\mathrm{target}} = E_{\\mathrm{set}}t_{\\mathrm{set}}$, and the $C_i$ represent the correction factors for each source of uncertainty. Since all contributing factors are independent, the combined relative standard uncertainty of the dose, $u_{c, \\mathrm{rel}}(H)$, can be calculated by summing the individual relative standard uncertainties in quadrature:\n$$u_{c, \\mathrm{rel}}^2(H) = \\left( \\frac{u_c(H)}{H} \\right)^2 = u_{\\mathrm{rel, cal}}^2 + u_{\\mathrm{rel, var}}^2 + u_{\\mathrm{rel, age}}^2 + u_{\\mathrm{rel, pos}}^2$$\n\nWe are given the following relative standard uncertainties:\n-   Calibration: $u_{\\mathrm{rel, cal}} = 0.03$\n-   Variability: $u_{\\mathrm{rel, var}} = 0.015$\n-   Aging: $u_{\\mathrm{rel, age}} = 0.02$\n\nWe must derive the relative standard uncertainty due to patient positioning, $u_{\\mathrm{rel, pos}}$. The dose $H$ is proportional to the irradiance $E$, which scales with the inverse square of the distance $r$ from the source: $H \\propto E \\propto r^{-2}$.\nFor a quantity $Y$ related to a variable $x$ by a power law $Y = c x^p$, the relative uncertainty in $Y$ due to the uncertainty in $x$ is given by $u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(Y) = | p \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(x) |$, where $u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(x) = u_x/x$.\nIn our case, the quantity is the dose $H$, the variable is the distance $r$, and the power is $p = -2$. The relative uncertainty in distance is $u_r/r_0$. Therefore, the relative standard uncertainty in the dose due to positioning is:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{rel, pos}} = \\left| -2 \\cdot \\frac{u_r}{r_0} \\right|$$\nSubstituting the given values $u_r = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and $r_0 = 50\\,\\mathrm{cm}$:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{rel, pos}} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{50\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 2 \\cdot 0.02 = 0.04$$\n\nNow we combine all the relative standard uncertainties in quadrature to find the combined relative standard uncertainty, $u_{c, \\mathrm{rel}}(H)$:\n$$u_{c, \\mathrm{rel}}^2(H) = (0.03)^2 + (0.015)^2 + (0.02)^2 + (0.04)^2$$\n$$u_{c, \\mathrm{rel}}^2(H) = 0.0009 + 0.000225 + 0.0004 + 0.0016$$\n$$u_{c, \\mathrm{rel}}^2(H) = 0.003125$$\nThe combined relative standard uncertainty is the square root of this value:\n$$u_{c, \\mathrm{rel}}(H) = \\sqrt{0.003125}$$\n\nTo find the combined standard uncertainty, $u_c(H)$, in absolute units, we multiply the combined relative standard uncertainty by the nominal dose, $H_{\\mathrm{target}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{J\\,cm^{-2}}$:\n$$u_c(H) = u_{c, \\mathrm{rel}}(H) \\cdot H_{\\mathrm{target}} = \\sqrt{0.003125} \\cdot 10\\,\\mathrm{J\\,cm^{-2}}$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the expanded uncertainty, $U_H$, with a coverage factor of $k=2$. The expanded uncertainty provides an interval that is expected to encompass a large fraction (typically $95\\%$ for $k=2$ and a normal distribution) of the distribution of values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand.\n$$U_H = k \\cdot u_c(H)$$\n$$U_H = 2 \\cdot \\left( \\sqrt{0.003125} \\cdot 10\\,\\mathrm{J\\,cm^{-2}} \\right)$$\n$$U_H = 20 \\cdot \\sqrt{0.003125}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,cm^{-2}}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{0.003125} \\approx 0.055901699$$\n$$U_H \\approx 20 \\cdot 0.055901699\\,\\mathrm{J\\,cm^{-2}} \\approx 1.11803398\\,\\mathrm{J\\,cm^{-2}}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested:\n$$U_H \\approx 1.12\\,\\mathrm{J\\,cm^{-2}}$$\nThis value represents the expanded uncertainty ($k=2$) for the delivered dose per session.",
