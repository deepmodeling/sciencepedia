            "solution": "The problem is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe explicit data and conditions provided in the problem statement are:\n- Total activity of onabotulinumtoxinA: $100$ Units\n- Volume of diluent (preservative-free normal saline): $2.0$ milliliters\n- Volume of aliquot for administration: $0.050$ milliliters\n- Assumption 1: Negligible volume contribution from the lyophilized powder.\n- Assumption 2: No adsorption losses to the container or syringe.\n- Assumption 3: Complete dissolution.\n- Required output 1: Concentration in Units per milliliter.\n- Required output 2: Dose in the $0.050$ milliliter aliquot in Units.\n- Rounding requirement: Round answers to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard clinical procedure for the reconstitution of a pharmaceutical product, specifically botulinum toxin. The quantities, units (Units, milliliters), and procedural steps are consistent with established practices in medicine and pharmacology. The underlying principles of solution concentration and dose calculation are fundamental to chemistry and pharmacy. The problem is scientifically and factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: All necessary information for the calculation is provided. The initial amount of substance ($100$ Units), the final volume of the solution (implicitly $2.0$ mL due to the negligible powder volume assumption), and the volume of the aliquot ($0.050$ mL) are clearly stated. The assumptions ensure that a unique and stable solution can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is formulated with precise, unambiguous, and quantitative language. It is devoid of subjective or opinion-based elements.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the disqualifying conditions. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the concentration of the reconstituted solution and the dose contained in a specific aliquot.\n\nFirst, we determine the concentration of the solution. Concentration, denoted by $C$, is defined as the amount of solute per unit volume of the solution.\nLet $U_{\\text{total}}$ be the total amount of onabotulinumtoxinA, and let $V_{\\text{solution}}$ be the final volume of the homogeneous solution.\nThe concentration is given by the formula:\n$$C = \\frac{U_{\\text{total}}}{V_{\\text{solution}}}$$\nAccording to the problem statement, $U_{\\text{total}} = 100$ Units.\nThe volume of the solution, $V_{\\text{solution}}$, is the volume of the diluent, $V_{\\text{saline}}$, as the volume contribution from the lyophilized powder is stated to be negligible.\nThus, $V_{\\text{solution}} = V_{\\text{saline}} = 2.0$ milliliters.\n\nSubstituting the given values into the concentration formula:\n$$C = \\frac{100 \\text{ Units}}{2.0 \\text{ mL}}$$\n$$C = 50 \\text{ Units/mL}$$\nThe problem explicitly instructs to round the final answer to three significant figures. Therefore, the concentration is reported as $50.0$ Units/mL.\n\nSecond, we determine the dose contained in the withdrawn aliquot. The dose, denoted by $D$, is the amount of active substance in a given volume. It is calculated by multiplying the concentration of the solution by the volume of the aliquot.\nLet $V_{\\text{aliquot}}$ be the volume of the aliquot.\nThe dose is given by the formula:\n$$D = C \\times V_{\\text{aliquot}}$$\nUsing the calculated concentration $C = 50$ Units/mL and the given aliquot volume $V_{\\text{aliquot}} = 0.050$ milliliters:\n$$D = (50 \\text{ Units/mL}) \\times (0.050 \\text{ mL})$$\n$$D = 2.5 \\text{ Units}$$\nAgain, adhering to the instruction to round the final answer to three significant figures, the dose is reported as $2.50$ Units.\n\nThe final answers are the concentration, $50.0$ Units/mL, and the dose, $2.50$ Units.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Total potency of Botulinum Neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A): $100$ Units (U).\n- Volume of first dilution: $V_{1} = 2.0$ milliliters (mL).\n- Volume of second dilution: $V_{2} = 2.5$ milliliters (mL).\n- Assumption 1: Isotropic tissue matrix with homogeneous permeability.\n- Assumption 2: The effective perfusion time ($t$) is directly proportional to the injected volume ($V$).

The relationship $r \\propto \\sqrt{t}$ is a cornerstone of diffusion processes, often expressed as $r \\sim \\sqrt{Dt}$ where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. The assumption that perfusion time $t$ is proportional to injected volume $V$ is reasonable for an injection at a constant flow rate. The context of BoNT-A dilutions is clinically relevant.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The total potency of $100$ U is extraneous information for the specific relationships provided but does not render the problem invalid; rather, it tests the ability to discern relevant from irrelevant data within a realistic clinical scenario.\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution proceeds by formalizing the relationships provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe first premise states that the effective perfusion time, denoted by $t$, is directly proportional to the injected volume, $V$. This relationship can be written as:\n$$ t \\propto V $$\nIntroducing a constant of proportionality, $k_{1}$, this becomes an equation:\n$$ t = k_{1} V $$\nThe constant $k_{1}$ depends on factors held constant between the two scenarios, such as the volumetric flow rate of the injection.\n\nThe second premise states that the characteristic radius of effect, $r$, scales with the square root of the perfusion time, $t$. This relationship is characteristic of diffusion-dominated processes and can be written as:\n$$ r \\propto \\sqrt{t} $$\nIntroducing a second constant of proportionality, $k_{2}$, yields the equation:\n$$ r = k_{2} \\sqrt{t} $$\nThe constant $k_{2}$ depends on the properties of the substance and the medium, such as the diffusion coefficient of BoNT-A in the tissue matrix, which are assumed to be the same for both dilutions.\n\nTo find the relationship between the radius of effect $r$ and the injected volume $V$, we combine these two equations. We substitute the expression for $t$ from the first equation into the second equation:\n$$ r = k_{2} \\sqrt{k_{1} V} $$\nThe constants $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ can be combined into a single constant of proportionality, $K = k_{2} \\sqrt{k_{1}}$. This simplifies the relationship to:\n$$ r = K \\sqrt{V} $$\nThis derived relationship, $r \\propto \\sqrt{V}$, indicates that the radius of effect is proportional to the square root of the injected volume.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}$. Using the relationship $r = K \\sqrt{V}$, we can write expressions for $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ corresponding to volumes $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, respectively:\n$$ r_{1} = K \\sqrt{V_{1}} $$\n$$ r_{2} = K \\sqrt{V_{2}} $$\nThe constant $K$ is identical for both cases because the underlying physical conditions (tissue properties, injection method, toxin properties) are assumed to be the same.\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}$ is then calculated as:\n$$ \\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}} = \\frac{K \\sqrt{V_{2}}}{K \\sqrt{V_{1}}} $$\nThe constant $K$ cancels, leaving:\n$$ \\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}} $$\nThis is the symbolic relationship for the ratio of the effective radii.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the volumes, $V_{1} = 2.0$ mL and $V_{2} = 2.5$ mL. The total potency of $100$ U is not required for this calculation, as the model provided depends only on volume and time.\n$$ \\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.5}{2.0}} $$\n$$ \\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}} = \\sqrt{1.25} $$\nThe numerical value of this expression is:\n$$ \\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}} \\approx 1.11803398... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}} \\approx 1.118 $$\nThis result indicates that increasing the dilution volume from $2.0$ mL to $2.5$ mL, while keeping the total dose constant, is expected to increase the radius of effect by a factor of approximately $1.118$.",

The storage modulus $G'$ of HA fillers, measured by oscillatory rheometry under small-amplitude shear, is a widely used surrogate of elastic stiffness in the linear regime. For isotropic linear elastic materials, the relationship between Young’s modulus $E$, shear modulus $G$, and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$ is given by $E=2G(1+\\nu)$. In the incompressible limit relevant to hydrated gels such as HA ($\\nu \\approx 0.5$), this implies $E \\approx 3G$. Under quasi-static, small-strain conditions, and at low frequencies where $G' \\approx G$, this approximation is commonly used to estimate compressive response.\n\nA dermatologist plans a midface augmentation using an HA filler deposit approximated as a uniform cylindrical plug of initial axial height $h_{0}$ subject to a uniform compressive stress $\\sigma$ transmitted by overlying tissues during expression.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elasticity and rheology, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, quantitative terms. The assumptions provided, such as linear elasticity and the incompressible limit, are standard approximations used for modeling soft biomaterials like hyaluronic acid gels.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the difference in axial deformation, $\\Delta h_{X} - \\Delta h_{Y}$, between two hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers, X and Y, under a specified compressive stress.\n\nThe axial compressive stress is denoted by $\\sigma$, and the resulting axial strain is denoted by $\\epsilon$.

First, the fillers are treated as incompressible isotropic linear elastic materials. For such materials, the relationship between Young’s modulus $E$, a shear modulus $G$, and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$ is $E = 2G(1+\\nu)$. In the incompressible limit, Poisson's ratio approaches $0.5$, so $\\nu \\approx 0.5$. This leads to the approximation:\n$$E \\approx 2G(1 + 0.5) = 2G(1.5) = 3G$$\n\nSecond, under the assumption of quasi-static, low-frequency conditions, the storage modulus $G'$, measured via oscillatory rheometry, is a good approximation of the static shear modulus $G$. Thus, we use the relation $G \\approx G'$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E$ yields:\n$$E \\approx 3G'$$\n\nNow, we substitute this approximated Young's modulus into our equation for the axial deformation $\\Delta h$:\n$$\\Delta h = \\frac{\\sigma \\cdot h_{0}}{3G'}$$\n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the deformation for each filler using its specific storage modulus.
