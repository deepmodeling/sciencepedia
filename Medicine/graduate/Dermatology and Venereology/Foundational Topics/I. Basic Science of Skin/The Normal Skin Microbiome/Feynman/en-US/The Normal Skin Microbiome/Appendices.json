            "problem": "An adult with clinically normal skin presents with a forearm site characterized by surface hydrogen ion concentration corresponding to $\\mathrm{pH}\\ 5.5$, a sebum level of $0.2 \\, \\mathrm{mg/cm}^2$, and ambient relative humidity of $40\\%$. Oxygen tension is near atmospheric. You are to predict the three most abundant resident bacterial genera expected at this site and choose the best option from the list.\n\nBase your prediction on first principles that govern microbial colonization under resource limitation and water availability on keratinized surfaces, using the following well-established foundations:\n\n- Water activity is defined as $a_w = p/p^\\ast$, where $p$ is the partial pressure of water vapor above the surface and $p^\\ast$ is the saturation vapor pressure at the same temperature. Under equilibrium with ambient air of relative humidity $\\mathrm{RH}$, $a_w \\approx \\mathrm{RH}/100$. On human stratum corneum, hygroscopic solutes (collectively referred to as the natural moisturizing factor) raise microfilm $a_w$ above ambient, but $a_w$ still scales with ambient $\\mathrm{RH}$.\n- Microbial growth on surfaces can be represented by resource-limited kinetics in which the specific growth rate $\\mu$ depends on the minimum of constraints imposed by nutrient concentration and water availability, for example $\\mu = \\mu_{\\max}\\,\\min\\left(\\frac{S}{K_S + S},\\,f(a_w)\\right)$, where $S$ is the concentration of the limiting nutrient, $K_S$ is the half-saturation constant, and $f(a_w)$ is a decreasing function as $a_w$ falls below the organism’s tolerance threshold.\n- Sebum is a lipid-rich nutrient source composed primarily of triglycerides, wax esters, free fatty acids, cholesterol, and squalene; its availability per unit area scales with the measured sebum level in $\\mathrm{mg/cm}^2$. Lipophilic, anaerobic organisms with strong lipase activity are favored when sebum is high and oxygen is restricted, whereas generalist, desiccation- and salt-tolerant Gram-positive organisms are favored when water is limiting and sebum is low.\n- The acid mantle at $\\mathrm{pH}\\ 5.5$ imposes acid stress that is tolerated by many skin commensals; differential tolerance and metabolism at low pH can influence competitive fitness.\n\nGiven these site parameters ($\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$, sebum $= 0.2 \\, \\mathrm{mg/cm}^2$, ambient $\\mathrm{RH} = 40\\%$), which trio of resident bacterial genera is most likely to be the three most abundant on the forearm, assuming steady-state colonization dominated by organisms that maximize $\\mu$ under the combined constraints of nutrient and water limitation at this dry, non-sebaceous, oxygenated site?\n\nChoose one option:\n\nA.

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters for a site on the forearm of an adult with clinically normal skin:\n-   Surface hydrogen ion concentration: $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$\n-   Sebum level: $0.2 \\, \\mathrm{mg/cm}^2$\n-   Ambient relative humidity (RH): $40\\%$\n-   Oxygen tension: Near atmospheric\n-   The question is to predict the three most abundant resident bacterial genera.\n\nThe problem also supplies the following foundational principles:\n1.  Water activity ($a_w$) is related to relative humidity: $a_w \\approx \\mathrm{RH}/100$.\n2.  Microbial specific growth rate ($\\mu$) is limited by the minimum of constraints, including nutrient concentration ($S$) and water availability ($a_w$): $\\mu = \\mu_{\\max}\\,\\min\\left(\\dfrac{S}{K_S + S},\\,f(a_w)\\right)$.\n3.  Sebum is a lipid-rich nutrient. High sebum and low oxygen favor lipophilic, anaerobic organisms. Low water and low sebum favor generalist, desiccation- and salt-tolerant Gram-positive organisms.\n4.  The acidic $\\mathrm{pH}$ of $5.5$ selects for acid-tolerant commensals.\n\nThe goal is to identify the trio of genera that maximizes growth rate ($\\mu$) under the combined constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the established criteria.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on established principles of microbial ecology and dermatology. The given parameters ($\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$, low sebum, low RH) are realistic for a dry skin site like the forearm. The relationship between environmental factors and microbial selection (e.g., desiccation tolerance, nutrient metabolism, oxygen requirements) is a cornerstone of microbiology. The kinetic model presented is a standard representation of resource-limited growth.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear set of environmental conditions and a set of established principles. It asks for a prediction based on applying these principles to the given conditions. A unique, meaningful answer is expected, representing the organisms best adapted to this specific ecological niche.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative parameters and objective scientific principles. There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically sound, and well-posed. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is **VALID**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem requires a prediction of the dominant bacterial genera based on the ecological pressures present at the specified skin site. We must analyze each environmental parameter and synthesize a profile of the expected dominant organism type.\n\n1.  **Site Analysis:** The forearm is anatomically classified as a \"dry\" or \"xerotic\" skin site, as opposed to \"sebaceous\" (e.g., forehead) or \"moist\" (e.g., axilla) sites. The provided data confirm this classification.\n2.  **Water Availability:** Ambient $\\mathrm{RH}$ is $40\\%$. According to the provided principle, this corresponds to a low water activity ($a_w$) environment, creating significant desiccation stress. Therefore, organisms must be highly **desiccation-tolerant** (xerotolerant).\n3.  **Nutrient Availability:** The sebum level is $0.2 \\, \\mathrm{mg/cm}^2$, which is very low. Sebum is the primary lipid-rich nutrient source. The third principle states that low sebum conditions favor \"generalist\" organisms rather than specialists. Specifically, this condition will select against **lipophilic** organisms that depend on high concentrations of lipids.\n4.  **Oxygen Availability:** The oxygen tension is \"near atmospheric,\" meaning the environment is **aerobic**. This will select against obligate anaerobes and favor aerobes or facultative anaerobes.\n5.  **Acidity:** The $\\mathrm{pH}$ is $5.5$. This is characteristic of the skin's \"acid mantle.\" Dominant resident organisms must be **acid-tolerant**. Most common skin commensals are adapted to this condition, so it is a general filter for skin residency.\n\n**Synthesized Ecological Profile:** The dominant bacteria at this site must be:\n-   Desiccation-tolerant\n-   Aerobic or facultative anaerobic\n-   Not dependent on high lipid concentrations (non-lipophilic generalists)\n-   Acid-tolerant\n-   Gram-positive (as stated by the provided principle for low-water, low-sebum sites)\n\nWe now evaluate the genera listed in the options against this profile.\n\n-   ***Staphylococcus***: Gram-positive cocci. They are facultative anaerobes, renowned for their exceptional tolerance to desiccation and high salinity (osmotic stress). They are metabolic generalists. *Staphylococcus epidermidis* is a quintessential resident of dry skin sites. This genus is an excellent fit.\n-   ***Corynebacterium***: Gram-positive rods. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic, acid-tolerant. They are common skin residents found across various site types. While some species are lipolytic and more abundant in moist/sebaceous sites, others are well-adapted to dry conditions. They are a core member of the skin microbiota and are a strong candidate.\n-   ***Micrococcus***: Gram-positive cocci. They are obligate aerobes and are extremely resistant to desiccation and other environmental stresses. Their presence is consistent with a dry, aerobic environment. This genus is a plausible candidate.\n-   ***Cutibacterium*** (formerly *Propionibacterium*): Gram-positive rods. They are characteristically **lipophilic** and prefer **anaerobic** or microaerophilic environments, such as the interior of sebaceous follicles. The conditions of the forearm (low sebum, high oxygen) are strongly selective *against* this genus. It should not be abundant.\n-   ***Malassezia***: This is a genus of **fungi** (yeasts), not bacteria. The question explicitly asks for the three most abundant resident **bacterial** genera. Furthermore, *Malassezia* species are lipophilic, requiring lipids for growth, making them poorly suited for a low-sebum site. This is an invalid candidate.\n-   ***Pseudomonas***, ***Acinetobacter***, ***Enterobacter***: These are Gram-negative genera. While they can be found on skin, they are typically less abundant than the core Gram-positive residents, especially on dry sites. They are often considered transient colonizers or are more associated with moist environments. The problem's principles specifically point towards Gram-positive dominance in this niche.\n-   ***Lactobacillus***: Gram-positive rods. They are not considered a dominant genus on the skin surface; their primary niche is the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts.\n-   ***Bacillus***: Gram-positive, spore-forming rods. Their spores are highly resistant to desiccation, but they are typically found as transients from the environment (e.g., soil, dust) and are not considered a major component of the *resident* skin microbiome in the same way as *Staphylococcus* or *Corynebacterium*.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus**\n-   *Staphylococcus*: Excellent fit. A desiccation-tolerant, aerobic-thriving generalist.\n-   *Corynebacterium*: Excellent fit. A common, acid-tolerant resident adapted to various skin sites, including dry ones.\n-   *Micrococcus*: Excellent fit. An obligately aerobic, highly desiccation-resistant commensal.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This trio consists entirely of Gram-positive bacteria that are well-adapted to the specified dry, aerobic, low-sebum, acidic environment. They are the expected dominant genera based on the provided first principles.\n\n**B. Cutibacterium, Staphylococcus, Malassezia**\n-   *Cutibacterium*: Incorrect. This genus is lipophilic and anaerobic, making it ill-suited for a low-sebum, aerobic site.\n-   *Malassezia*: Incorrect. This is a fungus, not a bacterium, and it is also lipophilic.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option contains two genera that are fundamentally mismatched with the specified environment and one that is not a bacterium.\n\n**C. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter**\n-   This option lists three Gram-negative genera. The dominant resident flora of dry skin is overwhelmingly Gram-positive. These genera are not expected to be the three *most abundant* residents.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This composition is not representative of the dominant resident community on dry, normal skin.\n\n**D. Cutibacterium, Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus**\n-   *Cutibacterium*: Incorrect. Mismatched with the low-sebum, aerobic conditions.\n-   *Lactobacillus*: Incorrect. Not a dominant resident of the skin surface.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option includes two genera not expected to be abundant in this niche.\n\n**E. Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium, Bacillus**\n-   *Cutibacterium*: Incorrect. Mismatched with the low-sebum, aerobic conditions.\n-   *Bacillus*: Plausible due to its resistance, but typically considered a transient genus from the environment, less abundant as a resident than core commensals like *Corynebacterium* or *Micrococcus*.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The inclusion of *Cutibacterium* makes this option a poor prediction for the most abundant genera.\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the provided ecological principles to the site parameters, the trio of *Staphylococcus*, *Corynebacterium*, and *Micrococcus* represents the bacterial community best adapted to thrive under the combined constraints of low water activity, low lipid availability, and high oxygen tension.",

            "problem": "A moist axillary skin site is dominated by Corynebacterium species at a surface density of $N_{\\text{resident}} = 2 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$. A rare Staphylococcus epidermidis strain is introduced at very low density. Assume classical interspecific competition applies and that when the invader is rare, its per-capita growth rate is determined by how the resident community depresses the invader’s access to limiting resources.

            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\nFirst, the problem statement is critically validated before any attempt at a solution.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Location: Moist axillary skin site.\n-   Resident species: *Corynebacterium* species.\n-   Resident surface density: $N_{\\text{resident}} = 2 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$.\n-   Invader species: Rare *Staphylococcus epidermidis* strain.\n-   Theoretical framework: Classical interspecific competition.\n-   Invader's intrinsic per-capita growth rate: $r_{\\text{inv}} = 0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$.\n-   Scenario 1 (High resource-overlap): Effective interspecific sensitivity coefficient $\\alpha_{\\text{eff, high}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}$.\n-   Scenario 2 (Resource-partitioned): Effective interspecific sensitivity coefficient $\\alpha_{\\text{eff, low}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}$.\n-   Invasion criterion: A positive per-capita growth rate for the invader when rare.\n-   Interpretation of $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}$: A measure of how strongly resident density reduces the invader’s per-capita growth through shared resource use.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is grounded in classical ecological competition theory, specifically the Lotka-Volterra model framework. The concept of an invasion analysis, where a rare invader's initial growth rate is assessed against a resident population, is a standard method in theoretical ecology. The parameters—cell densities, growth rates, and competition coefficients—are dimensionally consistent and within plausible ranges for microbial communities. The biological context, competition between *Corynebacterium* and *Staphylococcus* on skin, is a well-studied topic in dermatology and microbiology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, formalizable model for the invader's per-capita growth rate and a precise criterion ($>0$) for successful invasion. All necessary quantitative data are provided to evaluate each scenario and option.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe problem states that the per-capita growth rate of the rare invader is determined by its intrinsic growth rate, $r_{\\text{inv}}$, reduced by the competitive effect of the resident population, $N_{\\text{resident}}$. This can be formulated based on first-principles competition theory. The effective per-capita growth rate of the invader, $r_{\\text{inv,eff}}$, when it is rare ($N_{\\text{inv}} \\to 0$), is given by:\n$$\nr_{\\text{inv,eff}} = r_{\\text{inv}} - \\alpha_{\\text{eff}} N_{\\text{resident}}\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}$ is the interspecific competition coefficient representing the per-capita effect of the resident on the invader. The problem provides units for all quantities. Let's verify dimensional consistency:\n$$\n[\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}] \\times [N_{\\text{resident}}] = \\left( \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1} \\right) \\times \\left( \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2} \\right) = \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is consistent with the units of a rate, matching the units of $r_{\\text{inv}}$.\n\nThe invasion criterion is that the invader population must be able to grow from a rare state, which requires a positive per-capita growth rate:\n$$\nr_{\\text{inv,eff}} > 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r_{\\text{inv,eff}}$, the condition for successful invasion is:\n$$\nr_{\\text{inv}} - \\alpha_{\\text{eff}} N_{\\text{resident}} > 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad r_{\\text{inv}} > \\alpha_{\\text{eff}} N_{\\text{resident}}\n$$\nWe will now evaluate each option using this framework. The given intrinsic growth rate is $r_{\\text{inv}} = 0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Under the high resource-overlap scenario with $N_{\\text{resident}} = 2 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$, the invader’s per-capita growth rate when rare is positive, so invasion is predicted to proceed deterministically.**\n\nIn this scenario, $\\alpha_{\\text{eff, high}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}$ and $N_{\\text{resident}} = 2 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$.\nThe competitive pressure from the resident community is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{eff, high}} N_{\\text{resident}} = (1.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}) = 3.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\text{h}^{-1} = 0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe invader's effective per-capita growth rate is:\n$$\nr_{\\text{inv,eff}} = r_{\\text{inv}} - \\alpha_{\\text{eff, high}} N_{\\text{resident}} = 0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1} - 0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1} = 0\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe growth rate is zero, not positive. The invasion criterion $r_{\\text{inv,eff}} > 0$ is not met. A growth rate of $0$ implies neutral drift, not deterministic invasion. Therefore, the statement is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Under the resource-partitioned scenario with $N_{\\text{resident}} = 2 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$, invasion is predicted to succeed; this illustrates that reduced niche overlap lowers $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}$ sufficiently to allow invasion at the same resident density.**\n\nIn this scenario, $\\alpha_{\\text{eff, low}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}$ and $N_{\\text{resident}} = 2 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$.\nThe competitive pressure from the resident community is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{eff, low}} N_{\\text{resident}} = (0.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\text{h}^{-1} = 0.10\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe invader's effective per-capita growth rate is:\n$$\nr_{\\text{inv,eff}} = r_{\\text{inv}} - \\alpha_{\\text{eff, low}} N_{\\text{resident}} = 0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1} - 0.10\\ \\text{h}^{-1} = 0.20\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nSince $r_{\\text{inv,eff}} = 0.20\\ \\text{h}^{-1} > 0$, the invasion criterion is met. Invasion is predicted to succeed. The statement correctly identifies that reducing $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}$ (due to reduced niche overlap) is the mechanism allowing invasion, contrasting with the failure (neutrality) in scenario A at the same resident density.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. If, in the resource-partitioned scenario, the resident density increases to $N_{\\text{resident}} = 6 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$ while $r_{\\text{inv}}$ and $\\alpha_{\\text{eff, low}}$ remain unchanged, the invasion criterion is no longer met.**\n\nIn this scenario, $\\alpha_{\\text{eff, low}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}$ and the new resident density is $N_{\\text{resident}} = 6 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$. The intrinsic rate $r_{\\text{inv}}$ remains $0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$.\nThe new competitive pressure is:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{eff, low}} N_{\\text{resident}} = (0.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}) \\times (6 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}) = 3.0 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\text{h}^{-1} = 0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe invader's new effective per-capita growth rate is:\n$$\nr_{\\text{inv,eff}} = r_{\\text{inv}} - \\alpha_{\\text{eff, low}} N_{\\text{resident}} = 0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1} - 0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1} = 0\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nIn the original resource-partitioned scenario (Option B), the invasion criterion was met ($r_{\\text{inv,eff}} = 0.20\\ \\text{h}^{-1} > 0$). In this new scenario with higher resident density, the criterion $r_{\\text{inv,eff}} > 0$ is not met. Thus, the statement that \"the invasion criterion is no longer met\" is true.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The primary effect of resource partitioning, holding abiotic conditions fixed, is to increase $r_{\\text{inv}}$ by relieving intraspecific crowding within the invader population, with negligible effect on interspecific sensitivity.**\n\nThis statement contradicts the premises. The problem explicitly defines resource partitioning as the mechanism that *lowers* the interspecific sensitivity coefficient from $\\alpha_{\\text{eff, high}}$ to $\\alpha_{\\text{eff, low}}$. The statement claims a \"negligible effect on interspecific sensitivity,\" which is false. Furthermore, the problem holds $r_{\\text{inv}}$ constant at $0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1}$ across scenarios, so the claim that resource partitioning increases $r_{\\text{inv}}$ is also contrary to the problem setup. Finally, relief of *intraspecific* crowding relates to the invader's own density, a factor that is ignored in an invasion analysis where the invader is assumed to be at a very low density.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For fixed $r_{\\text{inv}}$ and $N_{\\text{resident}}$, any reduction of $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}$ below $1.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}$ will guarantee invasion regardless of the magnitude of $N_{\\text{resident}}$.**\n\nThis statement makes a strong claim of generality that is easily falsified. The invasion condition is $r_{\\text{inv}} > \\alpha_{\\text{eff}} N_{\\text{resident}}$. The term on the right, representing total competitive pressure, is a product of $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}$ and $N_{\\text{resident}}$. The clause \"regardless of the magnitude of $N_{\\text{resident}}$\" is incorrect because for any given $r_{\\text{inv}}$ and $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}} > 0$, one can always choose a sufficiently large $N_{\\text{resident}}$ such that $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}} N_{\\text{resident}} \\ge r_{\\text{inv}}$, causing the invasion to fail. For example, let's take an $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}$ slightly below the given value, say $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}' = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}$. To prevent invasion, we need $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}' N_{\\text{resident}} \\ge r_{\\text{inv}}$, which means $N_{\\text{resident}} \\ge r_{\\text{inv}} / \\alpha_{\\text{eff}}'$.\n$$\nN_{\\text{resident}} \\ge \\frac{0.30\\ \\text{h}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\text{h}^{-1}\\,\\text{cm}^{2}\\,\\text{cell}^{-1}} = 3 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}\n$$\nIf the resident density were, for example, $N_{\\text{resident}} = 4 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{cells}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$, invasion would fail even with the reduced $\\alpha_{\\text{eff}}$. Therefore, the guarantee of invasion \"regardless of the magnitude of $N_{\\text{resident}}$\" is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Then, using the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at level $q=0.05$ across $m=4$ hypotheses, proceed as follows without using any precomputed tables:\n\n1. Order the given p-values from smallest to largest and assign their ranks.\n2. Compute the BH step-up critical values based on their ranks and determine the largest rank $k$ for which the corresponding ordered p-value satisfies the step-up criterion.\n3. Compute the BH adjusted p-values for each ordered hypothesis by enforcing the required monotonicity across ranks.\n4. Identify which hypotheses $H_{i}$ would be rejected under BH at level $q=0.05$.\n\nReport as your final answer a single integer equal to the total number of taxa declared significant under the BH procedure. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution using established statistical principles.\n\nThe task is to determine the number of significant findings from a set of four hypothesis tests after correcting for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at a level of $q=0.05$.\n\nFirst, we address the justification for using a step-up thresholding approach like the BH procedure. When conducting multiple hypothesis tests, say $m$ tests, using a fixed significance level $\\alpha$ for each test inflates the probability of making at least one Type I error (a false positive). This is known as the multiple comparisons problem. A classical approach is to control the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER), defined as the probability of making one or more false discoveries, $FWER = P(V \\ge 1)$, where $V$ is the number of true null hypotheses that are rejected. However, controlling FWER (e.g., via the Bonferroni correction, which uses a threshold of $\\alpha/m$) is often too stringent, especially for a large number of tests, leading to a significant loss of statistical power and failure to detect true effects.\n\nAn alternative is to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR), proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg. The FDR is the expected proportion of false discoveries among all rejected hypotheses. Let $R$ be the total number of rejected hypotheses and $V$ be the number of false discoveries. The False Discovery Proportion is $Q = V/R$ (defined as $0$ if $R=0$). The FDR is the expectation of this quantity: $FDR = E[Q]$. Controlling the FDR at a level $q$ means ensuring that, on average, no more than a fraction $q$ of the discoveries made are false. This is a more liberal criterion than FWER control and generally provides greater power, which is desirable in exploratory studies like microbiome analysis where many features are tested simultaneously.\n\nThe BH procedure is a step-up method that achieves this control. It works by ordering the p-values and comparing them to a sequence of increasing thresholds. The step-up nature refers to finding the highest-ranked (largest) p-value that is still small enough to be considered significant, and then declaring it and all smaller p-values significant. This adaptive thresholding, $p_{(i)} \\le \\frac{i}{m}q$, correctly balances the trade-off: it is very strict for the smallest p-value (rank $i=1$) but becomes progressively more lenient for higher-ranked p-values. This justly accounts for the fact that out of $m$ tests, one would expect to see some small p-values by chance, and the threshold should adjust accordingly.\n\nWe now apply the BH procedure to the given data. We have $m=4$ hypotheses and desire to control the FDR at $q=0.05$. The assumption of mutual independence of test statistics is a condition under which the BH procedure is proven to control the FDR.\n\n1.  **Order the p-values and assign ranks.**\n    The given p-values are $p_1=0.001$, $p_2=0.02$, $p_3=0.04$, and $p_4=0.10$. We order them from smallest to largest and note their original hypotheses.\n    \n    -   Rank $i=1$: $p_{(1)} = 0.001$ (from $H_1$: Cutibacterium acnes)\n    -   Rank $i=2$: $p_{(2)} = 0.02$ (from $H_2$: Staphylococcus epidermidis)\n    -   Rank $i=3$: $p_{(3)} = 0.04$ (from $H_3$: Corynebacterium spp.)\n    -   Rank $i=4$: $p_{(4)} = 0.10$ (from $H_4$: Malassezia spp.)\n\n2.  **Compute BH critical values and find the largest rank $k$.**\n    The BH step-up critical value for the $i$-th ordered p-value, $p_{(i)}$, is given by $\\frac{i}{m}q$. We need to find the largest rank $k$ such that $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m}q$.\n    Here, $m=4$ and $q=0.05$.\n\n    -   For $i=1$: Compare $p_{(1)}$ to $\\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.05 = 0.0125$. We have $0.001 \\le 0.0125$. The condition holds.\n    -   For $i=2$: Compare $p_{(2)}$ to $\\frac{2}{4} \\times 0.05 = 0.025$. We have $0.02 \\le 0.025$. The condition holds.\n    -   For $i=3$: Compare $p_{(3)}$ to $\\frac{3}{4} \\times 0.05 = 0.0375$. We have $0.04 \\not\\le 0.0375$. The condition does not hold.\n    -   For $i=4$: Compare $p_{(4)}$ to $\\frac{4}{4} \\times 0.05 = 0.05$. We have $0.10 \\not\\le 0.05$. The condition does not hold.\n\n    The largest rank $k$ for which the condition $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m}q$ is met is $k=2$.\n\n3.  **Compute BH adjusted p-values.**\n    For completeness, we compute the adjusted p-values. The BH adjusted p-value for the $i$-th ordered hypothesis, $p_{(i)}^{adj}$, is calculated to enforce monotonicity. The formula is:\n    $$p_{(i)}^{adj} = \\min_{j=i}^{m} \\left( \\min \\left( 1, \\frac{m}{j} p_{(j)} \\right) \\right)$$\n\n    -   For $p_{(4)}$ ($i=4$): $p_{(4)}^{adj} = \\min \\left( 1, \\frac{4}{4}p_{(4)} \\right) = \\min(1, 1 \\times 0.10) = 0.10$.\n    -   For $p_{(3)}$ ($i=3$): $p_{(3)}^{adj} = \\min \\left( p_{(4)}^{adj}, \\frac{4}{3}p_{(3)} \\right) = \\min \\left( 0.10, \\frac{4}{3} \\times 0.04 \\right) = \\min(0.10, 0.0533...) = 0.0533....$\n    -   For $p_{(2)}$ ($i=2$): $p_{(2)}^{adj} = \\min \\left( p_{(3)}^{adj}, \\frac{4}{2}p_{(2)} \\right) = \\min \\left( 0.0533..., 2 \\times 0.02 \\right) = \\min(0.0533..., 0.04) = 0.04$.\n    -   For $p_{(1)}$ ($i=1$): $p_{(1)}^{adj} = \\min \\left( p_{(2)}^{adj}, \\frac{4}{1}p_{(1)} \\right) = \\min \\left( 0.04, 4 \\times 0.001 \\right) = \\min(0.04, 0.004) = 0.004$.\n\n    The adjusted p-values corresponding to the original hypotheses are:\n    -   $H_1$: $p_{adj} = 0.004$\n    -   $H_2$: $p_{adj} = 0.04$\n    -   $H_3$: $p_{adj} = 0.0533...$\n    -   $H_4$: $p_{adj} = 0.10$\n\n4.  **Identify which hypotheses are rejected.**\n    The BH procedure rejects all null hypotheses $H_{(i)}$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., k$. Since we found $k=2$, we reject the hypotheses corresponding to ranks $1$ and $2$.\n    \n    -   The hypothesis with rank $1$ is $H_1$ (Cutibacterium acnes).\n    -   The hypothesis with rank $2$ is $H_2$ (Staphylococcus epidermidis).\n\n    Alternatively, using the adjusted p-values, we reject any hypothesis for which $p_{adj} \\le q = 0.05$.\n    \n    -   $H_1$: $p_{adj} = 0.004 \\le 0.05$. Reject $H_1$.\n    -   $H_2$: $p_{adj} = 0.04 \\le 0.05$. Reject $H_2$.\n    -   $H_3$: $p_{adj} \\approx 0.0533 \\not\\le 0.05$. Do not reject $H_3$.\n    -   $H_4$: $p_{adj} = 0.10 \\not\\le 0.05$. Do not reject $H_4$.\n\n    Both methods lead to the same conclusion: two hypotheses are rejected. The taxa declared to have a significantly different relative abundance are *Cutibacterium acnes* and *Staphylococcus epidermidis*.\n\nThe total number of taxa declared significant is $2$.",
