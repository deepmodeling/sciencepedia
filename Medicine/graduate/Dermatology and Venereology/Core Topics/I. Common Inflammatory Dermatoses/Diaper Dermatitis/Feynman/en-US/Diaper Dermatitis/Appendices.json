            "problem": "A caregiver has been instructed to apply a barrier paste uniformly to an infant’s diaper area for irritant diaper dermatitis, adhering to a standard application rate that is specified per unit area to ensure a protective film and reduce trans-epidermal exposure to irritants. The diaper area to be covered each change is $150\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, and the barrier paste is to be applied at an application rate of $1\\ \\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ per change.

Each will be calculated sequentially and rounded to three significant figures as requested.\n\n1.  **Amount of barrier paste per change ($m_{change}$)**\n    The mass applied per change, denoted as $M_{change}$ in milligrams, is the product of the application rate $R$ and the area $A$.\n    $$M_{change} = R \\times A$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$M_{change} = (1\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}}) \\times (150\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}) = 150\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n    To express this quantity in grams, we use the conversion factor $1\\ \\mathrm{g} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{mg}$. Let $m_{change}$ be the mass in grams.\n    $$m_{change} = 150\\ \\mathrm{mg} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{g}}{1000\\ \\mathrm{mg}} = 0.150\\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n    This value is already expressed to three significant figures.\n\n2.  **Total amount of barrier paste per day ($m_{day}$)**\n    The total mass required per day is the mass per change, $m_{change}$, multiplied by the number of changes per day, $N_{d}$.\n    $$m_{day} = m_{change} \\times N_{d}$$\n    Substituting the values:\n    $$m_{day} = 0.150\\ \\mathrm{g} \\times 8 = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n    To adhere to the requirement of three significant figures, this result is written as $1.20\\ \\mathrm{g}$.\n\n3.  **Total amount of barrier paste for the full course ($m_{total}$)**\n    The total mass for the entire $14$-day course is the mass per day, $m_{day}$, multiplied by the total duration of the regimen in days, $T$.\n    $$m_{total} = m_{day} \\times T$$\n    Substituting the values:\n    $$m_{total} = 1.20\\ \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{day} \\times 14\\ \\mathrm{days} = 16.8\\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n    This value is already expressed to three significant figures.\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of the three calculated quantities: the amount per change, the amount per day, and the total amount for the course, all in grams and rounded to three significant figures.",

            "introduction": "While many cases of diaper dermatitis are irritant in nature, it is crucial to recognize specific infectious etiologies that require targeted therapy. Perianal streptococcal dermatitis is one such example that necessitates systemic antibiotics. In pediatric practice, safe and effective treatment is critically dependent on accurate weight-based dosing, a foundational skill for any clinician treating children. This problem provides hands-on practice in this vital calculation. ",

            "problem": "A 2-year-old child weighing 10 kilograms presents with sharply demarcated perianal erythema and tenderness consistent with perianal streptococcal dermatitis, a subtype of diaper dermatitis that requires systemic antibiotic therapy. The pediatric dosing regimen chosen is amoxicillin at 25 milligrams per kilogram per dose, administered twice daily for a 10-day course. Using the foundational rule of weight-based dosing in pediatrics—namely, that the per-dose amount in milligrams is the product of the child’s weight in kilograms and the prescribed milligram-per-kilogram-per-dose rate—and the fact that twice daily dosing corresponds to 2 doses per day, derive the per-dose milligrams and the total daily milligrams.\n\nYour derivation must start from the core definitions:\n- Per-dose quantity equals weight-based rate times body mass.\n- Total daily quantity equals the per-dose quantity times dosing frequency.\n\nDo not assume any tablet strength or suspension concentration; compute only the milligram quantities.

            "solution": "The validity of the problem statement is established through a systematic check of its premises and structure.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Child's weight: $10$ kilograms\n- Diagnosis: perianal streptococcal dermatitis\n- Medication: amoxicillin\n- Dosing rate: $25$ milligrams per kilogram per dose\n- Dosing frequency: twice daily\n- Treatment duration: $10$ day course\n- Core Definition 1: Per-dose quantity equals weight-based rate times body mass.\n- Core Definition 2: Total daily quantity equals the per-dose quantity times dosing frequency.\n- Required output: per-dose milligrams and total daily milligrams, presented as a row matrix.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a standard clinical scenario. Perianal streptococcal dermatitis is a recognized condition often treated with oral antibiotics like amoxicillin. A child's weight of $10$ kg is plausible for a $2$-year-old. The prescribed dose of $25 \\text{ mg/kg/dose}$ twice daily (totaling $50 \\text{ mg/kg/day}$) falls within the accepted therapeutic range for amoxicillin for treating streptococcal infections in children.

Calculation of the Per-Dose Quantity ($D_{\\text{dose}}$)**\n\nThe first principle states that the per-dose quantity is the product of the weight-based rate and the body mass. This can be expressed as the equation:\n$$D_{\\text{dose}} = R \\times m$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$D_{\\text{dose}} = \\left(25 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{dose}}\\right) \\times (10 \\text{ kg})$$\n\nThe units of kilograms ($\\text{kg}$) cancel, yielding a result in milligrams per dose ($\\text{mg/dose}$).\n$$D_{\\text{dose}} = 250 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dose}}$$\nThus, the per-dose quantity is $250$ milligrams.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Total Daily Quantity ($D_{\\text{daily}}$)**\n\nThe second principle states that the total daily quantity is the product of the per-dose quantity and the dosing frequency. This can be expressed as the equation:\n$$D_{\\text{daily}} = D_{\\text{dose}} \\times f$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value for $D_{\\text{dose}}$ and the given value for $f$:\n$$D_{\\text{daily}} = \\left(250 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dose}}\\right) \\times \\left(2 \\frac{\\text{doses}}{\\text{day}}\\right)$$\n\nThe units of doses cancel, yielding a result in milligrams per day ($\\text{mg/day}$).\n$$D_{\\text{daily}} = 500 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\nThus, the total daily quantity is $500$ milligrams.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be the per-dose milligrams and the total daily milligrams, expressed as a row matrix. The two calculated values are $250$ mg and $500$ mg, respectively.",

            "introduction": "Distinguishing simple irritant diaper dermatitis from a candidal superinfection is a common diagnostic challenge. While clinical acumen provides a pretest probability, diagnostic tests like a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation help refine the diagnosis.

Using only the fundamental definitions of sensitivity and specificity and Bayes’ theorem, derive the analytic expression for the post-test probability of disease after a positive test and compute its value for the given parameters. Express the final probability as a decimal number, not with a percent sign.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. The provided data are consistent and sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the analysis.\n\nLet $D$ denote the event that the child has candidal diaper dermatitis, and let $D^c$ denote the complementary event that the child does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event that the potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation yields a positive result. The goal is to determine the post-test probability of the disease given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The pretest probability, or prior probability, of the disease is $P(D) = 0.40$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is given as $0.85$. By definition, sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present. In our notation, this is $P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$.\n3.  The specificity of the test is given as $0.90$. By definition, specificity is the probability of a negative test result, let's call it $T^-$, given that the disease is absent. In our notation, this is $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.90$.\n\nFrom the pretest probability, we can immediately deduce the probability of the absence of the disease:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\n\nThe problem requires the use of Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability, which expresses $P(T^+)$ in terms of the conditional probabilities related to the presence or absence of the disease:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nWe have been given $P(T^+ | D)$, $P(D)$, and $P(D^c)$. The term $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent (i.e., the false positive rate). This can be derived from the specificity. The events of a positive test ($T^+$) and a negative test ($T^-$) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive for a given condition. Therefore, for the disease-absent population:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) + P(T^- | D^c) = 1$$\nWe can solve for the false positive rate:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nNow we can substitute the expanded form of $P(T^+)$ into Bayes' theorem to obtain the complete analytic expression for the post-test probability based on the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + (1 - P(T^- | D^c)) P(D^c)}$$\nIn more common terms, this is:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence})}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to compute the final answer:\n$P(D) = 0.40$\n$P(D^c) = 0.60$\n$P(T^+ | D) = 0.85$\n$P(T^+ | D^c) = 0.10$\n\nThe numerator is the probability of a true positive result:\n$$P(T^+ \\cap D) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) = (0.85) \\times (0.40) = 0.34$$\nThe denominator is the total probability of a positive result, which is the sum of the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.40) + (0.10)(0.60)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.34 + 0.06 = 0.40$$\n\nFinally, the post-test probability is the ratio of these values:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.34}{0.40}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{34}{40} = \\frac{17}{20} = 0.85$$\n\nThus, the post-test probability of the child having candidal diaper dermatitis after a positive KOH test is $0.85$.",
