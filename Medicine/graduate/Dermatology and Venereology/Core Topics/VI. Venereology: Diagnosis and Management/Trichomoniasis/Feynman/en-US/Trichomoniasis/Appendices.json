            "problem": "A sexually transmitted infection clinic in an urban setting evaluates symptomatic women for suspected Trichomonas vaginalis infection (trichomoniasis) using clinical features alone (e.g., frothy discharge, vulvovaginal erythema), without immediate laboratory confirmation by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). Empiric therapy with metronidazole is given only when the clinical diagnosis is positive. Consider a cohort of $N = 1000$ consecutively presenting symptomatic patients, where the true prevalence of trichomoniasis is $p_{T} = 0.18$. From prior validation against NAAT, the clinical diagnosis has sensitivity $Se = 0.62$ and specificity $Sp = 0.73$. Among patients without true trichomoniasis who nevertheless receive empiric metronidazole due to a positive clinical diagnosis, the probability of a clinically significant metronidazole adverse event within $7$ days is $p_{\\text{AE}} = 0.06$. Among patients with true trichomoniasis who are not treated because of a negative clinical diagnosis, the probability of developing a clinically significant sequela within $30$ days (e.g., persistent symptomatic infection or partner transmission requiring additional care) is $p_{\\text{Seq}} = 0.15$. Using only the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and the law of total probability, first compute the expected numbers of false positives and false negatives that arise when relying solely on clinical features in this cohort.

            "problem": "A clinical diagnostic accuracy study was conducted to evaluate the performance of wet mount microscopy for detecting Trichomonas vaginalis in the context of dermatology and venereology. All enrolled patients underwent a wet mount microscopy index test, denoted by $T \\in \\{T^{+}, T^{-}\\}$, where $T^{+}$ indicates a positive wet mount result and $T^{-}$ indicates a negative wet mount result. The reference standard was a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), denoted by $D \\in \\{D^{+}, D^{-}\\}$, where $D^{+}$ indicates infection present and $D^{-}$ indicates infection absent.

This implies that for a given index test result ($T^{+}$ or $T^{-}$), the characteristics of the verified subgroup are representative of the entire group with that same test result. Therefore, the conditional probability of disease status given the test result can be estimated from the verified subjects:\n$P(D \\mid T) = P(D \\mid T, V=1)$.\n\nWe can calculate the conditional probabilities of the true disease status from the verified data:\n- For wet mount positives:\n  $P(D^{+} \\mid T^{+}) = P(D^{+} \\mid T^{+}, V=1) = \\frac{n(D^{+}, T^{+}, V=1)}{n(T^{+}, V=1)} = \\frac{60}{72} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n  $P(D^{-} \\mid T^{+}) = P(D^{-} \\mid T^{+}, V=1) = \\frac{n(D^{-}, T^{+}, V=1)}{n(T^{+}, V=1)} = \\frac{12}{72} = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n- For wet mount negatives:\n  $P(D^{+} \\mid T^{-}) = P(D^{+} \\mid T^{-}, V=1) = \\frac{n(D^{+}, T^{-}, V=1)}{n(T^{-}, V=1)} = \\frac{24}{96} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n  $P(D^{-} \\mid T^{-}) = P(D^{-} \\mid T^{-}, V=1) = \\frac{n(D^{-}, T^{-}, V=1)}{n(T^{-}, V=1)} = \\frac{72}{96} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nUsing these probabilities, we can estimate the numbers of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives (TN) in the entire study cohort of $N=400$ patients.\n- Estimated number of true positives (patients with $T^{+}$ and $D^{+}$):\n  $N_{TP} = n(T^{+}) \\times P(D^{+} \\mid T^{+}) = 80 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{400}{6} = \\frac{200}{3}$.\n- Estimated number of false positives (patients with $T^{+}$ and $D^{-}$):\n  $N_{FP} = n(T^{+}) \\times P(D^{-} \\mid T^{+}) = 80 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{80}{6} = \\frac{40}{3}$.\n- Estimated number of false negatives (patients with $T^{-}$ and $D^{+}$):\n  $N_{FN} = n(T^{-}) \\times P(D^{+} \\mid T^{-}) = 320 \\times \\frac{1}{4} = 80$.\n- Estimated number of true negatives (patients with $T^{-}$ and $D^{-}$):\n  $N_{TN} = n(T^{-}) \\times P(D^{-} \\mid T^{-}) = 320 \\times \\frac{3}{4} = 240$.\n\nNow, we can estimate the total number of diseased ($D^{+}$) and non-diseased ($D^{-}$) individuals in the entire cohort:\n- Total estimated diseased: $N_{D^{+}} = N_{TP} + N_{FN} = \\frac{200}{3} + 80 = \\frac{200}{3} + \\frac{240}{3} = \\frac{440}{3}$.\n- Total estimated non-diseased: $N_{D^{-}} = N_{FP} + N_{TN} = \\frac{40}{3} + 240 = \\frac{40}{3} + \\frac{720}{3} = \\frac{760}{3}$.\nThe sum is $N_{D^{+}} + N_{D^{-}} = \\frac{440}{3} + \\frac{760}{3} = \\frac{1200}{3} = 400$, which matches the total study size.\n\nWith these estimated counts for the full cohort, we can calculate the adjusted sensitivity and specificity.\n\nSensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present:\n$S_e = P(T^{+} \\mid D^{+}) = \\frac{N_{TP}}{N_{D^{+}}} = \\frac{200/3}{440/3} = \\frac{200}{440} = \\frac{20}{44} = \\frac{5}{11}$.\nIn decimal form, $S_e = \\frac{5}{11} \\approx 0.454545...$.

Assume trichomoniasis causes a constant quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) decrement per infection-year, cured cases immediately return to baseline QALY, and reinfection produces additional infection time as described below. Use the following foundational definitions and facts: expected value over mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive outcomes, definitions of test sensitivity and specificity, and the definition of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as the ratio of the difference in expected costs to the difference in expected health effects (QALYs).\n\nUse a one-year time horizon with the following scientifically plausible parameters, where all costs are in United States dollars and all probabilities are expressed as decimals:\n- Prevalence of trichomoniasis among clinic attendees: $p = 0.08$.\n- Probability of being symptomatic among infected attendees: $a = 0.30$.\n- Probability of being symptomatic among uninfected attendees: $b = 0.05$.\n- NAAT sensitivity: $s = 0.96$.\n- NAAT specificity: $\\text{sp} = 0.98$.\n- Cost per NAAT: $c_{\\text{test}} = 30$.\n- Cost per index patient treatment (single-dose metronidazole): $c_{\\text{tx}} = 5$.\n- Probability that an index patient’s main partner receives treatment if the index is treated, under universal screening: $u = 0.70$.\n- Probability that an index patient’s main partner receives treatment if the index is treated, under symptom-based testing: $v = 0.50$.\n- Cost per partner treatment (expedited partner therapy): $c_{\\text{ptx}} = 5$.\n- If the index is treated and then reinfected within the year, the probability of reinfection when the partner is treated is $r_{t} = 0.05$, and when the partner is not treated is $r_{u} = 0.25$.\n- If reinfection occurs, assume, by symmetry of timing over the year, an expected infected duration of $h = 0.5$ years from the reinfection event until the end of the year.\n- For an untreated infection, assume infected for the full year.\n- Quality-adjusted life-year decrement per infection-year due to trichomoniasis: $d = 0.003$.\n- For uninfected persons treated due to false positives, assume no QALY change, only costs.\n\nAssume that under both strategies, a positive test leads to immediate effective treatment of the index patient with no residual infected time unless reinfection occurs; negative tests produce no treatment; and untested infected individuals remain infected for the entire year. Partner treatment occurs only when the index is treated, with probabilities $u$ and $v$ as above. No additional clinic visits are required beyond those implied by testing and treatment. Ignore any QALY decrement from medication side effects.\n\nCompute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of universal screening versus symptom-based testing from the clinic perspective, defined as the ratio of incremental expected cost to incremental expected QALYs gained per attendee over one year, using the parameters above. Express the final ICER in United States dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "We proceed from first principles using expected values, test performance definitions, and the definition of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). For each strategy, we compute the expected cost per attendee and the expected QALY loss per attendee over one year. The ICER is then the ratio of the difference in expected costs to the difference in expected QALYs.\n\nStep 1: Define expected testing and treatment under each strategy.\n\nFor universal screening, every attendee is tested once. Using sensitivity $s$ and specificity $\\text{sp}$, the expected fraction of index patients who receive treatment (i.e., test positive) is\n$$\np s + (1 - p)(1 - \\text{sp}).\n$$\nFor symptom-based testing, only symptomatic attendees are tested: infected symptomatic with probability $p a$ and uninfected symptomatic with probability $(1 - p) b$. Among those tested, positives occur with sensitivity $s$ for infected symptomatic and with false positive rate $(1 - \\text{sp})$ for uninfected symptomatic. Thus the expected fraction of index patients who receive treatment is\n$$\np a s + (1 - p) b (1 - \\text{sp}).\n$$\n\nStep 2: Expected costs per attendee.\n\nCosts include testing, index treatment for positives, and partner treatment for a proportion of treated index patients.\n\nUniversal screening expected cost per attendee:\n- Testing cost: $c_{\\text{test}} \\times 1$.\n- Index treatment cost: $c_{\\text{tx}} \\left[p s + (1 - p)(1 - \\text{sp})\\right]$.\n- Partner treatment cost: $c_{\\text{ptx}} \\, u \\left[p s + (1 - p)(1 - \\text{sp})\\right]$.\n\nThus,\n$$\nC_{\\text{uni}} = c_{\\text{test}} + c_{\\text{tx}} \\left[p s + (1 - p)(1 - \\text{sp})\\right] + c_{\\text{ptx}} \\, u \\left[p s + (1 - p)(1 - \\text{sp})\\right].\n$$\n\nSymptom-based testing expected cost per attendee:\n- Testing cost: $c_{\\text{test}} \\left[p a + (1 - p) b\\right]$.\n- Index treatment cost: $c_{\\text{tx}} \\left[p a s + (1 - p) b (1 - \\text{sp})\\right]$.\n- Partner treatment cost: $c_{\\text{ptx}} \\, v \\left[p a s + (1 - p) b (1 - \\text{sp})\\right]$.\n\nThus,\n$$\nC_{\\text{sym}} = c_{\\text{test}} \\left[p a + (1 - p) b\\right] + c_{\\text{tx}} \\left[p a s + (1 - p) b (1 - \\text{sp})\\right] + c_{\\text{ptx}} \\, v \\left[p a s + (1 - p) b (1 - \\text{sp})\\right].\n$$\n\nStep 3: Expected infection time and QALY loss per attendee.\n\nLet us compute the expected infection-years per infected attendee under each strategy.\n\nIf an infected attendee is treated, there is immediate cure, with possible reinfection during the year. The reinfection probability depends on partner management:\n- Under universal screening, partner treatment probability is $u$, so reinfection probability is\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{uni}} = u \\, r_{t} + (1 - u) r_{u}.\n$$\n- Under symptom-based testing, partner treatment probability is $v$, so reinfection probability is\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{sym}} = v \\, r_{t} + (1 - v) r_{u}.\n$$\n\nIf reinfection occurs, the expected infected duration is $h$ years. Thus, given treatment, the expected infection-years accrued due to reinfection are $h \\rho$.\n\nFor untreated infected attendees, the expected infection-years is $1$ for the year.\n\nUniversal screening: fraction treated among infected is $s$, and fraction untreated among infected is $(1 - s)$. Therefore, expected infection-years per infected attendee are\n$$\nE[T_{\\text{inf}} \\mid \\text{uni, infected}] = s \\, (h \\rho_{\\text{uni}}) + (1 - s) \\cdot 1.\n$$\n\nSymptom-based testing: fraction treated among infected is $a s$, and fraction untreated among infected is $1 - a s$.
