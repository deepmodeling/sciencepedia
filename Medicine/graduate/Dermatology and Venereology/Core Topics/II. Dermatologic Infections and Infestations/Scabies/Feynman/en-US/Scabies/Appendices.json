In dermatology, we often start with an initial suspicion—a pretest probability—which we then refine using diagnostic tests. This exercise demonstrates how to formally update your diagnostic certainty using Bayes' theorem, a fundamental tool in evidence-based medicine.

            "problem": "A dermatology clinic is managing an institutional outbreak of scabies caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis. An adult patient presents with generalized nocturnal pruritus, burrows in the finger webs, and involvement of the genital area. Based on the clinic’s outbreak context, household exposure, and lesion distribution, a validated pretest probability model estimates the patient’s probability of having scabies as $P(D) = 0.37$, where $D$ denotes the event that the patient truly has scabies.\n\nDermoscopy performed by an experienced clinician shows a positive finding consistent with a scabies mite within a burrow (the “delta-wing jet with contrail” sign). From a meta-analysis in a similar outbreak context, dermoscopy for this sign has sensitivity $P(+ \\mid D) = 0.89$ and specificity $P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 0.87$, where $+$ denotes a positive dermoscopy and $\\neg D$ denotes the complement of $D$ (no scabies).\n\nAssuming the test characteristics are applicable to this patient and that the dermoscopy result is conditionally independent of other risk factors given the disease status, use Bayes’ theorem, starting from the definition of conditional probability and the meanings of sensitivity and specificity, to compute the post-test probability $P(D \\mid +)$ of scabies given the positive dermoscopy observation.

The clinical context (scabies outbreak), symptoms (nocturnal pruritus, burrows), signs (delta-wing jet), and diagnostic test (dermoscopy) are all factually correct and relevant to the field of dermatology. The provided sensitivity and specificity values are plausible for such a diagnostic test. The problem is directly relevant to the topic of *scabies* in *dermatology and venereology*.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a single quantity, the post-test probability $P(D \\mid +)$, and provides all the necessary numerical inputs and probabilistic relationships to calculate it. The solution is unique and stable.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language.

While $P(+ \\mid \\neg D)$ is not given directly, it is derivable from the provided specificity, $P(- \\mid \\neg D)$. This is a standard and expected step in such problems.\n    4.  **Unrealistic/Infeasible**: None. The scenario and data are clinically realistic.\n    5.  **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured**: None. The problem is a classic and well-structured application of Bayesian inference.\n    6.  **Pseudo-Profound/Trivial**: None. The problem requires a correct application of a non-trivial theorem (Bayes' theorem).\n    7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: None. The calculation is mathematically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the post-test probability of the patient having scabies given a positive dermoscopy result, which is denoted as $P(D \\mid +)$. We will derive this using Bayes' theorem.\n\nBayes' theorem can be derived starting from the definition of conditional probability. For two events $A$ and $B$, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this to the events $D$ and $+$:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(D \\cap +)}{P(+)}$$\nThe numerator, the joint probability $P(D \\cap +)$, can be re-expressed using the multiplication rule, which is another arrangement of the conditional probability definition:\n$$P(D \\cap +) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D)$$\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. This can be expanded using the Law of Total Probability, partitioning the event space based on the disease status ($D$ or $\\neg D$):\n$$P(+) = P(+ \\cap D) + P(+ \\cap \\neg D)$$\nAgain, using the multiplication rule for each term:\n$$P(+) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nSubstituting these expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into the formula for $P(D \\mid +)$ yields Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}$$\nThe given values are:\n- The pretest probability (prior probability): $P(D) = 0.37$.\n- The sensitivity of the test: $P(+ \\mid D) = 0.89$.\n- The specificity of the test: $P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 0.87$.\n\nFrom these givens, we must derive the remaining probabilities needed for the formula.\nThe probability of not having the disease is the complement of the probability of having it:\n$$P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.37 = 0.63$$\nThe probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease, $P(+ \\mid \\neg D)$, is the complement of the specificity. Specificity is the probability of a negative test in a patient without the disease, $P(- \\mid \\neg D)$. Therefore:\n$$P(+ \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.87 = 0.13$$\nThis quantity, $P(+ \\mid \\neg D)$, is also known as the false positive rate.\n\nNow we substitute all the numerical values into Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{(0.89)(0.37)}{(0.89)(0.37) + (0.13)(0.63)}$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator and the two terms in the denominator:\n- Numerator: $P(+ \\mid D) P(D) = 0.89 \\times 0.37 = 0.3293$. This represents the probability of having scabies AND testing positive.\n- First term in denominator (same as numerator): $0.3293$.\n- Second term in denominator: $P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D) = 0.13 \\times 0.63 = 0.0819$. This represents the probability of not having scabies AND testing positive.\n\nNow, we complete the calculation:\n$$P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{0.3293}{0.3293 + 0.0819} = \\frac{0.3293}{0.4112}$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$P(D \\mid +) \\approx 0.800826848248...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $0$, $0$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$P(D \\mid +) \\approx 0.8008$$\nThis result indicates that the probability of the patient having scabies increased from a pretest probability of $37\\%$ to a post-test probability of approximately $80.1\\%$ after a positive dermoscopy finding.",

A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or bias.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is determined by executing the calculations as specified in the problem statement. This involves two distinct parts: calculating the number of tablets per dose, $T$, and determining the timing of the repeat dose, $d$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Number of Tablets ($T$)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of ivermectin, $M_{total}$, required for a single dose for the patient. According to the given rule, this is the product of the patient's body weight, $m_p$, and the mass-specific dose, $D_m$.\n\n$$M_{total} = m_p \\times D_m$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{total} = 70\\,\\text{kg} \\times 200\\,\\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{kg}} = 14000\\,\\mu\\text{g}$$\n\nNext, we convert this total mass from micrograms ($\\mu\\text{g}$) to milligrams ($\\text{mg}$) using the provided conversion factor, $1\\,\\text{mg} = 1000\\,\\mu\\text{g}$.\n\n$$M_{total, \\text{mg}} = \\frac{14000\\,\\mu\\text{g}}{1000\\,\\mu\\text{g}/\\text{mg}} = 14\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\nNow, we determine the number of tablets required. This is found by dividing the total milligram dose, $M_{total, \\text{mg}}$, by the strength of a single tablet, $S_t = 3\\,\\text{mg}$. Let $N$ be the exact (non-integer) number of tablets.\n\n$$N = \\frac{M_{total, \\text{mg}}}{S_t} = \\frac{14\\,\\text{mg}}{3\\,\\text{mg}} \\approx 4.666...$$\n\nThe problem specifies a rounding rule: \"discrete tablet counts must be rounded up to the smallest integer not less than the calculated requirement.\" This corresponds to the ceiling function, denoted $\\lceil \\cdot \\rceil$. Therefore, the integer number of tablets, $T$, is:\n\n$$T = \\lceil N \\rceil = \\lceil 4.666... \\rceil = 5$$\nSo, $5$ tablets are required per dose.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the Repeat Dose Timing ($d$)**\n\nThe problem states that the repeat dose is to be administered within the interval $[7, 14]$ days after the first dose. We must \"choose the earliest integer day in this interval.\" The set of integers within the inclusive interval $[7, 14]$ is $\\{7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\}$.\n\nThe earliest integer day, $d$, in this set is the minimum value of the set.\n\n$$d = \\min\\{7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\} = 7$$\nThe repeat dose is to be administered on day $7$.\n\n**Final Answer Assembly**\n\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} T  d \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFrom our calculations, $T = 5$ and $d = 7$.\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\begin{pmatrix} 5  7 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

The presentation of scabies, the standard treatment regimen (two doses of topical permethrin one week apart), the lifecycle of the *Sarcoptes scabiei* mite, the nature of the host immune response (delayed-type hypersensitivity), and the diagnostic methods (physical exam for burrows, dermoscopy, skin scrapings) are all factually and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear, time-ordered sequence of events, symptoms, clinical findings, and diagnostic results.

A unique and meaningful interpretation is possible.\n- **Objective:** The problem is described using precise, objective clinical terminology. The data (e.g., time points, findings) are presented without bias or subjective language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is a valid clinical reasoning problem. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the patient's clinical course at two key time points ($t=21$ days and $t=24$ days) to differentiate between three possible outcomes after scabies treatment: post-scabetic itch, true treatment failure, and reinfestation.\n\n**1. First-Principles Analysis:**\n\n*   **Parasite Biology:** The lifecycle of *Sarcoptes scabiei* from egg to mature adult takes approximately 10-14 days. Adult females burrow into the stratum corneum to lay eggs. Permethrin is a neurotoxin that kills live mites and nymphs but has limited ovicidal activity. The second treatment at $t=7$ days is crucial to kill mites that may have hatched from eggs that survived the initial $t=0$ treatment. Successful eradication means no viable mites, eggs, or nymphs remain.\n*   **Host Immune Response:** Pruritus in scabies is primarily caused by a delayed-type (Type IV) hypersensitivity reaction to the mite, its eggs, and its fecal pellets (scybala).\n    *   **Primary Infestation:** Symptoms typically take 2-6 weeks to develop as the immune system becomes sensitized.\n    *   **Reinfestation:** A previously sensitized individual will experience a rapid and intense pruritic reaction upon re-exposure, often within 24-48 hours.\n    *   **Post-Scabetic Itch:** After successful mite eradication, pruritus can persist for several weeks (commonly 2-4 weeks, but sometimes longer) because the mite antigens and debris remain in the epidermis and are only slowly cleared as the skin turns over. Nodular scabies, a specific granulomatous hypersensitivity response, can cause pruritic nodules that persist for months.\n*   **Clinical and Diagnostic Correlates:**\n    *   **Active Infestation (Treatment Failure or Reinfestation):** Characterized by the presence of viable mites. The definitive sign is the appearance of *new burrows*, which are tunnels created by actively burrowing female mites. Microscopic identification of a live mite, eggs, or fecal pellets is confirmatory proof.\n    *   **Eradication:** Characterized by the absence of viable mites. Clinically, this is supported by the non-appearance of new lesions (especially burrows) and a gradual resolution of pruritus over weeks. Skin scrapings and dermoscopy will be negative for active mites.\n\n**2. Application to the Case:**\n\n*   **Analysis at $t=21$ days:** The patient received two doses of permethrin ($t=0$, $t=7$ days), a standard curative regimen. At $t=21$ days (two weeks after the final treatment), he has persistent itch and nodules. However, there are **no new burrows**, and both dermoscopy and skin scrapings are **negative** for mites. This combination of findings is classic for **post-scabetic pruritus**. The persistent symptoms are due to the residual hypersensitivity reaction to dead mite products, not an active infestation.\n*   **Analysis at $t=24$ days:** The patient had a known, high-risk re-exposure to untreated contacts. Following this, he experienced an **abrupt onset of worsening pruritus** within 48 hours, which is the hallmark of a hypersensitivity reaction in a re-infested, previously sensitized host. Crucially, the examination now reveals **3 new burrows**, and a scraping yields a **live mite**. This is definitive, unequivocal evidence of a new, active infestation. Given the successful eradication apparent at $t=21$ days and the subsequent re-exposure, this is a clear case of **reinfestation**.\n*   **Distinguishing True Treatment Failure:** True treatment failure would mean that the regimen failed to eradicate the initial infestation. In this scenario, surviving mites would have matured and started creating new burrows. This would typically become evident by $t \\approx 14-28$ days after the *start* of treatment (i.e., 1-3 weeks after the second dose). The absence of new burrows at $t=21$ days argues strongly against treatment failure. The subsequent appearance of new burrows and a live mite *after* a specific re-exposure event solidifies the diagnosis of reinfestation rather than a relapse from the original treated episode.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Persistent itch at $t=21$ days with absent new burrows and negative mite/egg detection is most consistent with post-scabetic itch; abrupt pruritus at $t=24$ days with new burrows and a live mite after re-exposure is reinfestation; true treatment failure would typically be evident by $t=7$–14 days if live mites persist despite correctly executed therapy and contact management.**\n    *   The first part correctly identifies the findings at $t=21$ days as post-scabetic itch.\n    *   The second part correctly identifies the findings at $t=24$ days as reinfestation.\n    *   The third part correctly describes the principle of treatment failure—persistence of mites leading to new lesions—and provides a reasonable timeframe for its manifestation. New lesions would certainly be expected within a few weeks of failed therapy.\n    *   This statement accurately and comprehensively distinguishes the three conditions as they relate to the case.\n    *   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Any pruritus persisting beyond $t=7$ days signifies treatment failure; reinfestation requires at least 6 weeks post-exposure for symptoms, and negative scrapings cannot be used to support eradication.**\n    *   \"Any pruritus persisting beyond $t=7$ days signifies treatment failure\" is medically incorrect. Post-scabetic itch is a common phenomenon that lasts for weeks.\n    *   \"reinfestation requires at least 6 weeks post-exposure for symptoms\" is incorrect. This long incubation period applies to primary infestation. Reinfestation symptoms are rapid, typically appearing within 24-48 hours.\n    *   \"negative scrapings cannot be used to support eradication\" is an overstatement. While not 100% sensitive, negative scrapings, especially in the absence of new burrows, are strong supporting evidence for eradication.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The presence of nodules at $t=21$ days proves reinfestation; treatment failure cannot be distinguished from post-scabetic itch without Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing for Sarcoptes scabiei.**\n    *   \"The presence of nodules at $t=21$ days proves reinfestation\" is incorrect. Nodules are a hypersensitivity manifestation and are known to persist for months after successful treatment.\n    *   \"treatment failure cannot be distinguished from post-scabetic itch without Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing\" is incorrect. The most important clinical differentiator is the presence or absence of *new lesions* (burrows). While PCR is a sensitive tool, it is not required for diagnosis when clinical signs (or lack thereof) are clear.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. If contacts were treated, any subsequent pruritus indicates permethrin resistance; the finding of new burrows is not useful because burrows can persist for months independent of viable mites.**\n    *   \"If contacts were treated, any subsequent pruritus indicates permethrin resistance\" is incorrect. Firstly, not all relevant contacts (the roommates) were treated. Secondly, post-scabetic itch is a more common cause of persistent pruritus than resistance. This is an invalid logical leap.\n    *   \"the finding of new burrows is not useful because burrows can persist for months\" is a critical error. It confuses old, empty burrows with *newly forming* burrows. The appearance of *new* burrows is a pathognomonic sign of active infestation and is extremely useful diagnostically.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Post-scabetic itch is ruled out if eosinophilia is absent; reinfestation can be confirmed only by serology, which becomes positive after $t=14$ days.**\n    *   \"Post-scabetic itch is ruled out if eosinophilia is absent\" is incorrect. Eosinophilia is a non-specific and unreliable marker for scabies or its sequelae. Its absence is not exclusionary.\n    *   \"reinfestation can be confirmed only by serology\" is incorrect. Serology is not the standard of care for diagnosing scabies. The gold standard is direct microscopic identification of the mite, eggs, or scybala from skin scrapings, which is exactly what was done in this case to confirm reinfestation.\n    *   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
