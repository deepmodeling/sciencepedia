This exercise guides you through calculating the Likelihood Ratio for a classic Wood's lamp finding in vitiligo . Mastering this concept from evidence-based medicine allows you to precisely update your diagnostic confidence based on a physical examination finding.",

            "problem": "In a tertiary dermatology clinic studying vitiligo, consider the following scientifically grounded properties and observations. Vitiligo is characterized by autoimmune destruction of epidermal melanocytes leading to complete absence of melanin within affected macules or patches. Under a Wood’s lamp, which emits Ultraviolet (UV) radiation, vitiligo lesions demonstrate stark bluish-white accentuation because the absence of melanin unmasks dermal fluorescence and sharply increases optical contrast, whereas disorders with hypopigmentation (for example, pityriasis alba or postinflammatory hypopigmentation) retain residual melanin and typically show only minimal enhancement. Using the core definitions of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem in odds form as the fundamental base, derive the diagnostic Likelihood Ratio (LR) for the positive finding defined as “stark bluish-white accentuation under Wood’s lamp” compared to the negative characterization of “minimal enhancement.” A consecutive cohort of $N=320$ patients with clinically suspected depigmented or hypopigmented lesions underwent Wood’s lamp examination and histopathological confirmation. Histopathology confirmed vitiligo in $N_{D}=200$ patients and non-vitiligo hypopigmentation in $N_{\\bar{D}}=120$ patients. The Wood’s lamp finding of “stark bluish-white accentuation” was observed in $188$ of the $200$ vitiligo-confirmed cases and in $12$ of the $120$ non-vitiligo cases. Starting from the foundational definitions of conditional probabilities and applying Bayes’ theorem in odds form without invoking any shortcut formulas, derive the expression for the diagnostic LR of the positive Wood’s lamp finding in terms of these probabilities, then compute its numerical value from the provided data. Round your final answer to three significant figures and express it as a pure number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a consistent and complete set of data within a realistic clinical context, allowing for a rigorous, formal solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expression for the diagnostic Likelihood Ratio for a positive test finding ($LR+$) starting from the fundamental definitions of conditional probability and Bayes' theorem in odds form, and then to compute its value using the provided clinical data.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that a patient has vitiligo (disease is present).\n- $\\bar{D}$: The event that a patient has non-vitiligo hypopigmentation (disease is absent).\n- $T$: The event of a positive test finding, defined as \"stark bluish-white accentuation under Wood’s lamp.\"\n\nThe problem provides the following data from a cohort of $N=320$ patients:\n- Number of patients with confirmed vitiligo: $N_{D} = 200$.\n- Number of patients with non-vitiligo hypopigmentation: $N_{\\bar{D}} = 120$.\n- Number of patients with vitiligo who had a positive test (True Positives, $TP$): $188$.\n- Number of patients without vitiligo who had a positive test (False Positives, $FP$): $12$.\n\nThe derivation begins with Bayes' theorem, which relates the posterior probability of disease given a positive test, $P(D|T)$, to the prior probability of disease, $P(D)$, and the conditional probability of the test result, $P(T|D)$.\nThe standard form of Bayes' theorem is:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)} $$\nSimilarly, for the absence of disease:\n$$ P(\\bar{D}|T) = \\frac{P(T|\\bar{D})P(\\bar{D})}{P(T)} $$\n\nTo derive the odds form, we take the ratio of these two probabilities. The ratio $\\frac{P(D|T)}{P(\\bar{D}|T)}$ represents the posterior odds of having the disease given a positive test result.\n$$ \\frac{P(D|T)}{P(\\bar{D}|T)} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}}{\\frac{P(T|\\bar{D})P(\\bar{D})}{P(T)}} $$\nThe term $P(T)$ in the denominator of both expressions cancels out, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{P(D|T)}{P(\\bar{D}|T)} = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|\\bar{D})P(\\bar{D})} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged by grouping terms related to the test and terms related to the prior probabilities:\n$$ \\frac{P(D|T)}{P(\\bar{D}|T)} = \\left(\\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|\\bar{D})}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(\\bar{D})}\\right) $$\nThis equation is the odds form of Bayes' theorem. It states that the posterior odds are equal to the product of the prior odds, $\\frac{P(D)}{P(\\bar{D})}$, and a factor that updates the odds based on the test result. This updating factor is defined as the Likelihood Ratio.\n\nFor a positive test result ($T$), this factor is the positive Likelihood Ratio, $LR+$. From the equation above, we derive its expression:\n$$ LR+ = \\frac{P(T|D)}{P(T|\\bar{D})} $$\nThe numerator, $P(T|D)$, is the probability of a positive test in a patient with the disease. This is the True Positive Rate, or sensitivity. The denominator, $P(T|\\bar{D})$, is the probability of a positive test in a patient without the disease. This is the False Positive Rate.\n\nNow, we compute these probabilities from the given data.\nThe probability $P(T|D)$ is estimated from the sample as the number of true positives divided by the total number of diseased patients:\n$$ P(T|D) = \\frac{TP}{N_D} = \\frac{188}{200} = 0.94 $$\nThe probability $P(T|\\bar{D})$ is estimated as the number of false positives divided by the total number of non-diseased patients:\n$$ P(T|\\bar{D}) = \\frac{FP}{N_{\\bar{D}}} = \\frac{12}{120} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 $$\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for the positive Likelihood Ratio:\n$$ LR+ = \\frac{0.94}{0.1} = 9.4 $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Thus, the numerical value is $9.40$. This value indicates that a positive Wood's lamp finding of \"stark bluish-white accentuation\" is $9.4$ times more likely to be seen in a patient with vitiligo than in a patient with non-vitiligo hypopigmentation.",

            "introduction": "Once vitiligo is diagnosed, objectively quantifying its extent and severity is crucial for determining treatment and monitoring response.

            "problem": "A clinician is quantifying vitiligo burden using the Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI), which is based on the following foundational facts: a \"hand unit\" corresponds to the palmar surface of the patient’s hand including the volar surface of the digits and approximates $1$ percent of the total body surface area; the degree of depigmentation of a lesion is represented as a fraction $D$ in $[0,1]$; and the VASI for any region is the sum, over all lesions in that region, of the product of hand units involved and the fractional depigmentation. For disjoint regions, the overall VASI is the sum of the regional VASI values. In this problem, the \"facial region\" for the facial VASI (F-VASI) is defined as the head and neck combined, consistent with the Rule of Nines, which together constitute approximately $9$ hand units, ensuring that an involvement of up to $9$ hand units on the face is physically plausible.\n\nA patient with non-segmental vitiligo has the following involvement:\n- Facial region: involvement totaling $5$ hand units with uniform depigmentation fraction $0.5$.\n- Trunk region: involvement totaling $10$ hand units with uniform depigmentation fraction $0.25$.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions above, compute:\n- the facial Vitiligo Area Scoring Index ($F\\text{-}VASI$) for the facial region, and\n- the overall VASI restricted to the facial and trunk regions combined.\n\nExpress both results as exact values with no units.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI) is a recognized clinical tool in dermatology, and the problem provides a clear, quantitative framework for its calculation based on sound definitions. All data required for the calculation are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe VASI for a given anatomical region is defined as the summation of the product of the area of involvement (measured in \"hand units\") and the degree of depigmentation for each lesion within that region. For a region with total involved area $A$ and a uniform fractional depigmentation $D$, this calculation simplifies to the direct product of these two quantities.\nLet $VASI_R$ denote the score for a region $R$. If the area of involvement is $A_R$ and the uniform depigmentation is $D_R$, the score is given by:\n$$VASI_R = A_R \\times D_R$$\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the facial VASI ($F\\text{-}VASI$) and the overall VASI for the facial and trunk regions combined.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $F\\text{-}VASI$.\nThe problem states that the facial region has an involvement totaling $A_F = 5$ hand units with a uniform depigmentation fraction of $D_F = 0.5$.\nUsing the formula, the $F\\text{-}VASI$ is:\n$$F\\text{-}VASI = A_F \\times D_F = 5 \\times 0.5 = 2.5$$\nThe given information that the entire head and neck region constitutes approximately $9$ hand units serves to establish the plausibility of the stated involvement of $5$ hand units, as $5 < 9$. This value is not otherwise used in the calculation of the score for the affected area.\n\nSecond, we calculate the overall VASI for the combination of the facial and trunk regions. The problem states that for disjoint regions, the overall VASI is the sum of the individual regional VASI values. The facial and trunk regions are anatomically disjoint.\nLet $VASI_{overall}$ be the combined score.\n$$VASI_{overall} = VASI_{facial} + VASI_{trunk}$$\nWe have already calculated $VASI_{facial} = F\\text{-}VASI = 2.5$.\nNext, we must calculate the VASI for the trunk region, $VASI_{trunk}$. The data for the trunk region are an involvement of $A_T = 10$ hand units with a uniform depigmentation fraction of $D_T = 0.25$.\nUsing the same formula:\n$$VASI_{trunk} = A_T \\times D_T = 10 \\times 0.25 = 2.5$$\nNow, we sum the scores for the two regions to find the overall VASI:\n$$VASI_{overall} = VASI_{facial} + VASI_{trunk} = 2.5 + 2.5 = 5.0$$\n\nThe two required values are the $F\\text{-}VASI$ and the overall VASI, in that order.\n- $F\\text{-}VASI = 2.5$\n- Overall VASI = $5.0$\n\nThe final answer is to be provided as a pair of exact values.",
