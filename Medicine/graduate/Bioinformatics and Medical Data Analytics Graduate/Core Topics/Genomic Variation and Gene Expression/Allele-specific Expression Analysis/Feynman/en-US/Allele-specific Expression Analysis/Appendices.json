At the variant site, each read that overlaps the site can be unequivocally assigned to either the reference allele or the alternate allele based on the observed nucleotide. Let $n$ denote the total number of informative reads at this site, and let $X$ denote the number of reads assigned to the reference allele. Assume the following baseline principles as the fundamental starting point: the Central Dogma of molecular biology states that messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) levels reflect transcription from genomic DNA; in a diploid organism with no allelic imbalance, both alleles of a gene contribute equally to the mRNA pool; and, conditional on the total count $n$, and in the absence of systematic technical biases or mapping preferences, each read arises independently from either allele with equal probability.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the correct formulation of the null and alternative hypotheses, and the justification for the sidedness of the statistical test, for detecting allele-specific expression (ASE) from RNA-seq data.\n\nFirst, the core problem statement must be validated for its scientific and logical soundness.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   **Context**: Allele-specific expression analysis of a heterozygous single-nucleotide variant in a diploid human sample.\n-   **Data/Variables**:\n    -   $n$: total number of informative reads at the variant site.\n    -   $X$: number of reads assigned to the reference allele.\n-   **Statistical Model**: $X$ is a realization from a binomial process, $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p)$.\n-   **Parameter**: $p$ is the probability that any given informative read maps to the reference allele.\n-   **Baseline Principles**:\n    1.  mRNA levels reflect transcription from genomic DNA.\n    2.  In a diploid organism with no allelic imbalance, both alleles contribute equally to the mRNA pool.\n    3.  Conditional on $n$, without technical bias, each read arises independently from either allele with equal probability.\n-   **Condition**: The research team has no directional prior information about which allele might be more highly expressed.\n-   **Objective**: Determine the appropriate null hypothesis ($H_0$), alternative hypothesis ($H_A$), and the sidedness of the statistical test.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is valid.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The premise is a standard and fundamental problem in bioinformatics and statistical genetics. The use of a binomial test to assess allelic imbalance from read counts is a well-established method. The principles cited are correct representations of the underlying biology and the ideal experimental setup.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The question is clear and unambiguous. It asks for the design of a hypothesis test based on a precisely described scenario and set of assumptions. A unique, logically derivable answer exists within the framework of statistical hypothesis testing.\n-   **Objective**: The language is formal and objective. It presents a standard scientific scenario without introducing subjective or biased elements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity). Therefore, we may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe objective is to test for allele-specific expression. ASE is defined as a significant deviation from equal expression of the two alleles.\n\n1.  **Formulation of the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The null hypothesis represents the state of no effect. In this context, \"no effect\" means no allele-specific expression. According to the provided principles, if there is no allelic imbalance, both alleles contribute equally to the mRNA pool. This implies that the true proportion of mRNA from the reference allele is $0.5$. Assuming no technical biases (as stated in the problem), the probability $p$ of an observed read originating from the reference allele is also $0.5$. Thus, the null hypothesis is:\n    $$H_0: p = 0.5$$\n\n2.  **Formulation of the Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$)**: The alternative hypothesis represents the presence of the effect of interest, which is ASE. ASE occurs if one allele is expressed more than the other. This means the proportion of mRNA from the reference allele is not $0.5$. It could be greater than $0.5$ (reference allele is more highly expressed) or less than $0.5$ (alternate allele is more highly expressed). The problem explicitly states that there is \"no directional prior information about which allele...is more highly expressed\". This is a critical constraint. When there is no a priori reason to suspect a deviation in a particular direction, the alternative hypothesis must account for a deviation in either direction. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis is:\n    $$H_A: p \\neq 0.5$$\n\n3.  **Determining the Sidedness of the Test**: The structure of the alternative hypothesis dictates the sidedness of the test.\n    -   An alternative of the form $H_A: p > p_0$ or $H_A: p < p_0$ leads to a one-sided (or one-tailed) test.\n    -   An alternative of the form $H_A: p \\neq p_0$ leads to a two-sided (or two-tailed) test.\n    Since our alternative hypothesis is $H_A: p \\neq 0.5$, the correct statistical procedure is a two-sided test. This test will consider extreme outcomes in both tails of the null distribution (i.e., very large values of $X$ or very small values of $X$) as evidence against $H_0$. This approach aligns with the scientific question, where an imbalance favoring either the reference or the alternate allele is equally valid evidence of ASE.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Set $H_0: p = 0.5$ versus $H_A: p \\neq 0.5$. Use a two-sided test because, without directional prior information and under exchangeability of alleles, deviations in either direction are biologically meaningful; the sampling model $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n, p)$ under unbiased conditions is symmetric around $p = 0.5$, so both tails must be considered.**\nThis option correctly identifies the null hypothesis ($H_0: p = 0.5$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_A: p \\neq 0.5$). It correctly recommends a two-sided test. The justification is entirely sound:\n-   The lack of directional prior information is the key factor mandating a two-sided alternative.\n-   The concept of \"exchangeability of alleles\" correctly implies that a deviation in favor of the reference allele is just as scientifically meaningful as a deviation in favor of the alternate allele.\n-   The symmetry of the binomial distribution when $p=0.5$ is a correct statistical property that supports treating both tails symmetrically when calculating probabilities under the null hypothesis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Set $H_0: p = 0.5$ versus $H_A: p > 0.5$. Use a one-sided test because reference-mapping bias can increase the probability that reads map to the reference allele; therefore, the alternative should reflect $p$ being larger than $0.5$.**\nThis option is incorrect. The problem statement explicitly requires us to assume \"the absence of systematic technical biases or mapping preferences\". This option's justification is based on the presence of a specific technical bias, thereby violating a core premise of the problem. Furthermore, it ignores the crucial information that the team has \"no directional prior information\". Choosing a one-sided test would mean the researchers are willfully ignoring the possibility that the alternate allele is more highly expressed ($p < 0.5$), which is not scientifically sound given the stated problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Set $H_0: p = 0.5$ versus $H_A: p \\neq 0.5$. Use a one-sided test in practice to gain statistical power across many loci since two-sided tests divide the significance level across two tails and are thus less powerful.**\nThis option contains a severe logical contradiction. It states the correct alternative hypothesis for a two-sided test ($H_A: p \\neq 0.5$) but then recommends using a one-sided test. This is an invalid statistical procedure. While a one-sided test is more powerful for detecting an effect in a pre-specified direction, it has no power to detect an effect in the opposite direction. Choosing a test procedure that does not match the research hypothesis in a misguided attempt to \"gain power\" is inappropriate and can lead to false conclusions. The choice of test must be determined by the scientific question, not by a desire to achieve a smaller p-value.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Set $H_0: p = 0.5$ versus $H_A: p \\neq 0.5$. Use a two-sided test only when $n$ is even so that the sampling distribution is exactly symmetric around $n/2$; when $n$ is odd, use a one-sided test because the distribution is not exactly symmetric.**\nThis option is incorrect. The choice between a one-sided and two-sided test is dictated by the alternative hypothesis, not by incidental properties of the sample size $n$. The scientific question does not change based on whether $n$ is even or odd. The binomial distribution with $p=0.5$ is always symmetric in the sense that $P(X=k) = P(X=n-k)$. Whether $n$ is even or odd slightly affects the calculation of exact p-values (especially for methods like the binomial test), but it in no way justifies switching from a two-sided to a one-sided test paradigm. Such a procedure has no basis in statistical theory.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   A heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located in a tumor sample.\n-   The genomic segment containing the SNP is affected by Copy Number Variation (CNV).\n-   $c_1$: haploid copy number for allele A, where $c_1 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n-   $c_2$: haploid copy number for allele B, where $c_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n-   The tumor sample purity is $100\\%$.\n-   There is no subclonality within the segment.\n-   Allele-specific expression (ASE) is analyzed using RNA-seq reads.\n-   Assumption 1: Equal transcriptional output per genomic copy.\n-   Assumption 2: No allelic mapping, capture, or amplification bias.\n-   Assumption 3: Reads are independent and identically distributed draws from the expressed transcripts.\n-   The allele-specific read count for allele A, denoted by $X$, out of a total of $n$ informative reads, is modeled as $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p)$.\n-   $p$ is the probability that a randomly sampled read originates from allele A.\n-   The question asks for the correct expression for the null-hypothesis value of $p$ that accounts for CNV.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in the field of cancer genomics and bioinformatics. The concepts of SNP, CNV, ASE, and RNA-seq are fundamental. The use of a Binomial distribution to model read counts is a standard statistical practice. The assumptions define a clear null model, which is a common approach in hypothesis testing for ASE.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of assumptions and asks for the derivation of a parameter, $p$, within the specified model. The information provided is sufficient to determine a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terms.\n4.  **Complete and Consistent**: The problem statement is self-contained. It defines all variables ($c_1, c_2, X, n, p$) and provides the necessary assumptions to link the genomic state (copy numbers) to the transcriptomic readout (read counts). The assumptions are mutually consistent and define a coherent theoretical model. The condition $c_1, c_2 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ (natural numbers, typically $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$) is clear and ensures that at least one copy of each allele exists, which is consistent with the initial heterozygous state, though the framework would also accommodate a Loss of Heterozygosity scenario if one copy number were $0$ (assuming $\\mathbb{N}$ included $0$).\n5.  **Realistic**: The scenario is a standard and realistic problem in computational cancer biology. While simplifications like $100\\%$ tumor purity are idealizations, they are common and necessary for creating tractable baseline models.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided to derive a solution.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe problem asks for the null-hypothesis value of the parameter $p$ for a Binomial distribution, where $p$ is the probability that a randomly sampled RNA-seq read originates from allele A. This probability is equivalent to the proportion of transcripts from allele A among the total pool of transcripts from both alleles A and B at the locus.\n\nLet $E_A$ be the total transcriptional expression level of allele A and $E_B$ be the total transcriptional expression level of allele B. By definition, the probability $p$ is the fraction of expression from allele A relative to the total expression:\n$$p = \\dfrac{E_A}{E_A + E_B}$$\n\nWe are given the following information and assumptions:\n1.  There are $c_1$ genomic copies of allele A and $c_2$ genomic copies of allele B.\n2.  There is an \"equal transcriptional output per genomic copy\". Let's denote this constant rate of transcription per copy as $k$.\n3.  The null hypothesis assumes no other factors contribute to differential expression (i.e., \"no intrinsic allele-specific regulation\").\n\nBased on these points, the total expression from allele A is the number of copies of allele A multiplied by the expression per copy:\n$$E_A = c_1 \\cdot k$$\n\nSimilarly, the total expression from allele B is:\n$$E_B = c_2 \\cdot k$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the equation for $p$:\n$$p = \\dfrac{c_1 \\cdot k}{(c_1 \\cdot k) + (c_2 \\cdot k)}$$\n\nWe can factor out the constant $k$ from the denominator:\n$$p = \\dfrac{c_1 \\cdot k}{k \\cdot (c_1 + c_2)}$$\n\nSince transcriptional output is non-zero ($k > 0$), we can cancel $k$ from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$p = \\dfrac{c_1}{c_1 + c_2}$$\n\nThis expression for $p$ represents the expected proportion of allele A reads under the null hypothesis that allelic imbalance is driven solely by the copy numbers of the respective alleles, with no other regulatory effects and no experimental biases.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. $p = 0.5$**\nThis expression assumes an equal proportion of transcripts from both alleles. This would be the correct null hypothesis for a diploid organism with no CNV, where $c_1 = 1$ and $c_2 = 1$. In that specific case, our derived formula gives $p = \\dfrac{1}{1+1} = 0.5$. However, the problem explicitly states the presence of a CNV, meaning we cannot assume $c_1 = c_2$. This option ignores the central premise of the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $p = \\dfrac{c_1}{c_1 + c_2}$**\nThis expression perfectly matches the result derived from first principles. It correctly formulates the probability $p$ as the proportion of genomic copies of allele A relative to the total number of genomic copies of both alleles. This directly models the effect of CNV on transcript abundance under the null hypothesis.\n**Verdict: Correct**.\n\n**C. $p = \\dfrac{c_1}{c_2}$**\nThis expression represents the ratio of the copy number of allele A to that of allele B. This is not a probability, as it is not bounded between $0$ and $1$. For instance, if $c_1 = 3$ and $c_2 = 1$, this formula would yield $p = 3$, which is an impossible value for the probability parameter of a Binomial distribution.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $p = \\dfrac{c_1^2}{c_1^2 + c_2^2}$**\nThis expression posits a quadratic relationship between copy number and transcript proportion. The problem's assumption of \"equal transcriptional output per genomic copy\" implies a direct, linear relationship. There is no biological or theoretical justification provided in the problem statement that would lead to squaring the copy numbers.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**.",

The test statistic is standardized using the null standard error. Under $H_0$, the mean of $\\hat{p}$ is $p_0 = 0.5$, and its standard error, denoted $\\text{SE}_0(\\hat{p})$, is:\n$$\\text{SE}_0(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.25}{n}} = \\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\nThe large-sample test statistic, $Z$, is given by:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\text{SE}_0(\\hat{p})} = \\frac{\\hat{p} - 0.5}{0.5/\\sqrt{n}}$$\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nFor a two-sided test with a significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if the observed test statistic is in the tails of the standard normal distribution. The rejection region is defined by $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal distribution. This is the value such that $P(Z > z_{1-\\alpha/2}) = \\alpha/2$.\n\nNext, we derive the statistical power of this test. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ is true, i.e., when the true probability is $p \\neq 0.5$. The power is a function of $n$, $\\alpha$, and $p$.\n$$\\text{Power}(p, n, \\alpha) = P(\\text{Reject } H_0 | p) = P(|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} | p)$$\nThis can be written as the sum of probabilities of two disjoint events:\n$$\\text{Power} = P(Z > z_{1-\\alpha/2} | p) + P(Z < -z_{1-\\alpha/2} | p)$$\nWe express the inequalities in terms of $\\hat{p}$:\n$$P\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p} - 0.5}{0.5/\\sqrt{n}} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\right) + P\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p} - 0.5}{0.5/\\sqrt{n}} < -z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\right)$$\n$$= P\\left(\\hat{p} > 0.5 + z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) + P\\left(\\hat{p} < 0.5 - z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\frac{0.5}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)$$\nUnder the alternative hypothesis, the true distribution of $\\hat{p}$ is approximately $N(p, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n})$.

We need the quantile $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.8} \\approx 0.841621$.\n\nFor the alternative $p = 0.6$, which is greater than $p_0=0.5$, the term $\\sqrt{n}(p-0.5)$ is positive. The second term in the power function, $\\Phi\\left(\\frac{-\\sqrt{n}(p-0.5) - 0.5 z_{1-\\alpha/2}}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\\right)$, will have a large negative argument and thus be negligible. The power is therefore well-approximated by the first term.\n$$1 - \\beta \\approx \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(p-0.5) - 0.5 z_{1-\\alpha/2}}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\\right)$$\nTo achieve power of at least $1-\\beta$, we require:\n$$\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(p-0.5) - 0.5 z_{1-\\alpha/2}}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}} \\ge z_{1-\\beta}$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$\\sqrt{n}(p-0.5) \\ge z_{1-\\beta}\\sqrt{p(1-p)} + 0.5 z_{1-\\alpha/2}$$\n$$\\sqrt{n} \\ge \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{0.5(1-0.5)} + z_{1-\\beta}\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{p-0.5}$$\nPlugging in the values $p_0=0.5$, $p=0.6$, $\\alpha=0.05$, and $1-\\beta=0.8$:\n$$\\sqrt{n} \\ge \\frac{z_{0.975}\\sqrt{0.25} + z_{0.8}\\sqrt{0.6(1-0.6)}}{0.6-0.5}$$\n$$\\sqrt{n} \\ge \\frac{1.959964 \\times 0.5 + 0.841621 \\times \\sqrt{0.24}}{0.1}$$\n$$\\sqrt{n} \\ge \\frac{0.979982 + 0.841621 \\times 0.4898979}{0.1}$$\n$$\\sqrt{n} \\ge \\frac{0.979982 + 0.412292}{0.1}$$\n$$\\sqrt{n} \\ge \\frac{1.392274}{0.1} = 13.92274$$\nSquaring both sides to find $n$:\n$$n \\ge (13.92274)^2 \\approx 193.842$$\nSince the sample size $n$ must be an integer, we must take the smallest integer satisfying this condition, which is obtained by rounding up.\n$$n = 194$$\nTherefore, a minimum sample size of $194$ reads is required to achieve at least $80\\%$ power.",
