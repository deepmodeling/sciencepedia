It is based on the fundamental principles of mass calculation in proteomics. All necessary data are provided and are factually correct. The problem specifies a modification for Cysteine on a peptide that does not contain Cysteine. This is not a contradiction but a realistic scenario in bioinformatics where a standard analysis protocol (e.g., fixed modification on Cys) is applied to all peptides identified in an experiment, regardless of whether they contain the target residue. The correct procedure is to note that the modification rule does not apply to this specific peptide. Therefore, the problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe theoretical monoisotopic mass of the peptide is calculated by first determining its exact elemental composition and then summing the monoisotopic masses of its constituent atoms.\n\n**A. Determine the Gross Elemental Composition**\nFirst, we sum the elemental compositions of all the free amino acids present in the sequence \"MPEPTIDE\". The peptide consists of $8$ amino acid residues: $1$ Methionine (M), $2$ Proline (P), $2$ Glutamic acid (E), $1$ Threonine (T), $1$ Isoleucine (I), and $1$ Aspartic acid (D).\n\n- Composition of M ($1$ residue): $\\mathrm{C_{5}H_{11}N_{1}O_{2}S_{1}}$\n- Composition of P ($2$ residues): $2 \\times (\\mathrm{C_{5}H_{9}N_{1}O_{2}}) = \\mathrm{C_{10}H_{18}N_{2}O_{4}}$\n- Composition of E ($2$ residues): $2 \\times (\\mathrm{C_{5}H_{9}N_{1}O_{4}}) = \\mathrm{C_{10}H_{18}N_{2}O_{8}}$\n- Composition of T ($1$ residue): $\\mathrm{C_{4}H_{9}N_{1}O_{3}}$\n- Composition of I ($1$ residue): $\\mathrm{C_{6}H_{13}N_{1}O_{2}}$\n- Composition of D ($1$ residue): $\\mathrm{C_{4}H_{7}N_{1}O_{4}}$\n\nThe gross composition is the sum of these individual compositions:\n- Carbon (C): $5 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 6 + 4 = 39$\n- Hydrogen (H): $11 + 18 + 18 + 9 + 13 + 7 = 76$\n- Nitrogen (N): $1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8$\n- Oxygen (O): $2 + 4 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 23$\n- Sulfur (S): $1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1$\n\nThe gross formula from summing the free amino acids is $\\mathrm{C_{39}H_{76}N_{8}O_{23}S_{1}}$.\n\n**B. Account for Peptide Bond Formation**\nA linear peptide chain with $n$ amino acid residues contains $n-1$ peptide bonds. For the peptide \"MPEPTIDE\", $n=8$, so there are $n-1 = 7$ peptide bonds. Each bond is formed via a condensation reaction that eliminates one molecule of water ($\\mathrm{H_{2}O}$). Therefore, we must subtract the elemental composition of $7$ water molecules from the gross formula.\n\n- Atoms to subtract: $7 \\times \\mathrm{H_{2}O} = \\mathrm{H_{14}O_{7}}$.\n\n**C. Determine the Elemental Composition of the Neutral Peptide**\nWe subtract the atoms from the water molecules from the gross formula:\n- Carbon (C): $39$\n- Hydrogen (H): $76 - 14 = 62$\n- Nitrogen (N): $8$\n- Oxygen (O): $23 - 7 = 16$\n- Sulfur (S): $1$\n\nThe resulting elemental composition for the neutral peptide \"MPEPTIDE\" is $\\mathrm{C_{39}H_{62}N_{8}O_{16}S_{1}}$.\n\n**D. Account for Fixed Modifications**\nThe problem specifies a fixed modification of carbamidomethylation on Cysteine residues. The peptide sequence \"MPEPTIDE\" does not contain any Cysteine (C) residues. Thus, this modification is not applied, and there is no change to the elemental composition of the peptide.\n\n**E. Calculate the Theoretical Monoisotopic Mass**\nThe monoisotopic mass ($M$) is calculated by summing the masses of the most abundant isotopes for each element, multiplied by the count of that element in the final formula $\\mathrm{C_{39}H_{62}N_{8}O_{16}S_{1}}$.\n\n$M = (39 \\times m_C) + (62 \\times m_H) + (8 \\times m_N) + (16 \\times m_O) + (1 \\times m_S)$\n\nUsing the provided high-precision atomic masses:\n- Mass from C: $39 \\times 12.000000000 = 468.000000000$ Da\n- Mass from H: $62 \\times 1.00782503223 = 62.48515199826$ Da\n- Mass from N: $8 \\times 14.00307400443 = 112.02459203544$ Da\n- Mass from O: $16 \\times 15.99491461957 = 255.91863391312$ Da\n- Mass from S: $1 \\times 31.9720711744 = 31.9720711744$ Da\n\nSumming these values:\n$$ M = 468.000000000 + 62.48515199826 + 112.02459203544 + 255.91863391312 + 31.9720711744 $$\n$$ M = 930.40044912122 \\text{ Da} $$\n\n**F. Round to the Required Precision**\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to $5$ significant figures.\nThe calculated mass is $930.40044912122$. The first $5$ significant figures are $9$, $3$, $0$, $4$, and $0$. The sixth significant figure is $0$, so we round down.\nThe rounded mass is $930.40$ Da.",

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information (the list of PSMs and labels) and clear, objective tasks. The terms used are standard in the field. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, is completely formalizable, and is directly relevant to the topic of protein identification. There are no contradictions or missing information that would prevent a unique solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the FDR Estimator and Calculation\n\nThe problem defines the false discovery rate at a score threshold $t$, denoted $FDR(t)$, as the expected proportion of false PSMs among all accepted PSMs.\nLet $R(t)$ be the number of accepted PSMs at threshold $t$, and let $V(t)$ be the number of false discoveries (incorrect matches) among them. The FDR is then\n$$FDR(t) = E\\left[ \\frac{V(t)}{R(t)} \\right]$$\nwith the fraction taken to be $0$ if $R(t) = 0$.\n\nIn practice, we compute an estimate, $\\widehat{FDR}(t)$, from the observed data. The \"accepted PSMs\" in the context of protein identification are the target PSMs that pass the score threshold. Decoy PSMs are a statistical tool used for the estimation of false positives and are not included in the final reported list of identifications. Therefore, the set of accepted discoveries consists of target PSMs with a score greater than $t$. The number of such PSMs, an estimate for $R(t)$, is:\n$$\\hat{R}(t) = N_T(t) = |\\{\\text{PSM}_i \\mid \\text{score}(\\text{PSM}_i) > t \\text{ and label}(\\text{PSM}_i) = \\text{Target}\\}|$$\n\nThe number of false discoveries, $V(t)$, is the number of incorrect PSMs within this accepted target list. These are target PSMs that originate from null spectra (spectra for which no correct peptide sequence exists in the target database). The number of these false-positive target hits, $FP_T(t)$, must be estimated.\n\nThe central assumption of the target-decoy methodology is that for a null spectrum, the score distribution of its best match against the decoy database is the same as the score distribution of its best match against the target database. In a competitive search using a concatenated database of equal size (a standard assumption), a null spectrum has an equal chance of being matched to a target or a decoy sequence. This symmetry implies that, at any given score threshold $t$, the number of false-positive target PSMs with scores greater than $t$ is approximately equal to the number of decoy PSMs with scores greater than $t$. Decoy PSMs are, by construction, incorrect matches. Let $N_D(t)$ be the number of decoy PSMs with scores $> t$:\n$$N_D(t) = |\\{\\text{PSM}_i \\mid \\text{score}(\\text{PSM}_i) > t \\text{ and label}(\\text{PSM}_i) = \\text{Decoy}\\}|$$\nOur estimate for the number of false discoveries is thus $\\hat{V}(t) = N_D(t)$.\n\nCombining these elements, the derived practical estimator for the PSM-level FDR is:\n$$\\widehat{FDR}(t) = \\frac{\\hat{V}(t)}{\\hat{R}(t)} = \\frac{N_D(t)}{N_T(t)}$$\nThis estimator is used provided $N_T(t) > 0$. If $N_T(t)=0$, then $\\widehat{FDR}(t) = 0$.\n\nNow, we compute the FDR for the score threshold $t_{0}=48.5$. We must count the number of target and decoy PSMs with scores strictly greater than $48.5$. By inspecting the provided list:\n- The PSMs with score $> 48.5$ are PSM $1$ through PSM $18$.\n- Within this set, we count the number of target-labeled PSMs. These are PSMs 1-12, 14, 15, 17, and 18. Thus, $N_T(48.5) = 16$.\n- We count the number of decoy-labeled PSMs. These are PSMs 13 and 16. Thus, $N_D(48.5) = 2$.\n- The estimated FDR at this threshold is:\n$$\\widehat{FDR}(48.5) = \\frac{N_D(48.5)}{N_T(48.5)} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$$\nAs a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures, this is $0.1250$.\n\n### Part 2: Determination of the Score Cutoff $t_{\\ast}$\n\nWe are tasked to find the smallest score cutoff $t_{\\ast}$ such that the estimated PSM-level FDR is less than or equal to $0.01$. This requires finding the minimum $t_{\\ast}$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$\\widehat{FDR}(t_{\\ast}) = \\frac{N_D(t_{\\ast})}{N_T(t_{\\ast})} \\le 0.01$$\nThis inequality can be rewritten as $N_D(t_{\\ast}) \\le 0.01 \\times N_T(t_{\\ast})$.\n\nSince $N_D(t_{\\ast})$ must be a non-negative integer, we can analyze the condition.\nIf $N_D(t_{\\ast}) \\ge 1$, the inequality would require $1 \\le 0.01 \\times N_T(t_{\\ast})$, which implies $N_T(t_{\\ast}) \\ge 100$.\nBy inspecting the provided list of $30$ PSMs, the maximum possible number of target hits is $24$. It is therefore impossible to satisfy the condition $N_T(t_{\\ast}) \\ge 100$ with this dataset.\nThis forces the conclusion that the only way to satisfy the FDR criterion is to have $N_D(t_{\\ast}) = 0$.\n\nThe condition $N_D(t_{\\ast}) = 0$ means that no decoy PSMs are accepted. According to the acceptance rule (score $> t_{\\ast}$), this means that the score of every decoy PSM in the dataset must be less than or equal to $t_{\\ast}$. This is equivalent to requiring that the threshold $t_{\\ast}$ be greater than or equal to the score of the highest-scoring decoy PSM.\n\nWe scan the list to find the highest-scoring decoy PSM.\n- The first decoy from the top of the list is PSM $13$, with a score of $52.7$.\n- All other decoy PSMs (PSM $16$, $20$, $23$, $26$, $28$) have lower scores.\nThus, the highest decoy score is $52.7$.\n\nTo ensure $N_D(t_{\\ast}) = 0$, we must set the threshold $t_{\\ast}$ such that $t_{\\ast} \\ge 52.7$. Any threshold lower than $52.7$ would result in PSM $13$ being accepted (since its score of $52.7$ would be greater than $t_{\\ast}$), which would yield $N_D(t_{\\ast}) \\ge 1$ and violate the FDR condition.\n\nWe seek the *smallest* score cutoff $t_{\\ast}$ that satisfies $t_{\\ast} \\ge 52.7$. The set of all valid thresholds is the interval $[52.7, \\infty)$. The minimum value in this set is $52.7$.\n\nLet's verify this choice. If we set $t_{\\ast} = 52.7$, the accepted PSMs are those with score $> 52.7$. These are PSMs 1 through 12, all of which are targets.\n- $N_T(52.7) = 12$.\n- $N_D(52.7) = 0$.\n- $\\widehat{FDR}(52.7) = \\frac{0}{12} = 0$.\nThe condition $0 \\le 0.01$ is satisfied.\n\nIf we were to choose any threshold $t'$ such that $t' < 52.7$, at least one decoy (PSM $13$) would be included in the accepted list. For example, for a threshold $t' = 52.69$, we would have $N_D(t')=1$ and $N_T(t')=12$, yielding $\\widehat{FDR}(t') = 1/12 \\approx 0.0833$, which is greater than $0.01$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest score cutoff that meets the required FDR criterion is $t_{\\ast} = 52.7$. According to the problem instructions, since this value coincides with an observed score, it should be reported exactly.",
