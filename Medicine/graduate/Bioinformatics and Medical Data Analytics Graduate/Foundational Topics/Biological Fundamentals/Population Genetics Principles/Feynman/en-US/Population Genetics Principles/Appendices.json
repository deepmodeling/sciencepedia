            "problem": "A biobank-based medical genomics study genotypes a biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphism with alleles $A$ and $a$ in a cohort of $N=500$ unrelated individuals. The observed genotype counts are $n_{AA}=280$, $n_{Aa}=160$, and $n_{aa}=60$. Assume that the underlying sampling mechanism for genotypes is independent across individuals and that, conditional on the allele frequency $p$ of allele $A$ in the population, genotype counts arise from a multinomial sampling model whose cell probabilities are implied by the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) principle of random mating in a large, closed population with no mutation, migration, or selection at the locus.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions that (i) allele frequency is the proportion of alleles carried by the sample, (ii) under HWE the genotype probabilities are functions of $p$ and $q=1-p$ determined by random union of gametes, and (iii) the expected counts under a multinomial model equal the sample size multiplied by the corresponding cell probabilities:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem will be validated by first extracting the given information and then scrutinizing it against established criteria for scientific soundness and completeness.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Sample size: $N=500$ unrelated individuals.\n- Observed genotype counts: $n_{AA}=280$, $n_{Aa}=160$, $n_{aa}=60$.\n- Locus is a biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphism with alleles $A$ and $a$.\n- Allele frequency of $A$ is denoted by $p$.\n- The sampling model is multinomial.\n- The model assumes Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), implying genotype probabilities are $P(AA)=p^2$, $P(Aa)=2p(1-p)$, and $P(aa)=(1-p)^2$.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific or Factual Soundness**: The problem is grounded in the fundamental principles of population genetics, specifically the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and employs standard statistical methodologies (Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Pearson's chi-square test) for parameter estimation and model fitting. The concepts are scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for the calculation of a maximum likelihood estimate, expected counts, and a test statistic. These are well-defined quantities that can be uniquely determined from the provided data and model assumptions.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n4.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The given genotype counts sum to the total sample size: $n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa} = 280 + 160 + 60 = 500 = N$. The problem provides all necessary information and is internally consistent.\n5.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The observed counts and sample size are realistic for a biobank study. No physical or scientific impossibilities are present.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested: deriving the maximum likelihood estimate of the allele frequency, calculating the expected genotype counts under HWE, and computing the chi-square test statistic.\n\n#### 1. Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of $p$\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles. Under the assumption of HWE, the probabilities for genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ are $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$ respectively, where $q = 1-p$. The observed counts $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa})$ are assumed to follow a multinomial distribution with parameters $N$ and probabilities $(p^2, 2p(1-p), (1-p)^2)$.\n\nThe likelihood function $L(p)$ is proportional to the probability of observing the given data, conditional on the parameter $p$:\n$$L(p | n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa}) \\propto (P(AA))^{n_{AA}} (P(Aa))^{n_{Aa}} (P(aa))^{n_{aa}}$$\nSubstituting the HWE probabilities:\n$$L(p) \\propto (p^2)^{n_{AA}} (2p(1-p))^{n_{Aa}} ((1-p)^2)^{n_{aa}}$$\nWe can ignore the constant factor of $2^{n_{Aa}}$ for maximization:\n$$L(p) \\propto p^{2n_{AA}} p^{n_{Aa}} (1-p)^{n_{Aa}} (1-p)^{2n_{aa}}$$\n$$L(p) \\propto p^{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}} (1-p)^{n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}}$$\n\nTo find the value of $p$ that maximizes $L(p)$, we work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(p) = \\ln(L(p))$:\n$$\\ell(p) = C + (2n_{AA} + n_{Aa})\\ln(p) + (n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa})\\ln(1-p)$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant. We differentiate $\\ell(p)$ with respect to $p$ and set the derivative to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{p} - \\frac{n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}}{1-p} = 0$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{p} = \\frac{n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}}{1-p}$$\n$$(1-p)(2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}) = p(n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa})$$\n$$2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} - p(2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}) = p(n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa})$$\n$$2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} = p(2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}) = p(2n_{AA} + 2n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa})$$\n$$2n_{AA} + n_{Aa} = p \\cdot 2(n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa}) = p \\cdot 2N$$\nThe maximum likelihood estimate, $\\hat{p}$, is therefore:\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{2N}$$\nThis result confirms that the MLE is equivalent to the allele frequency calculated by direct counting of alleles in the sample.\n\nUsing the given counts ($n_{AA}=280$, $n_{Aa}=160$, $N=500$):\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{2(280) + 160}{2(500)} = \\frac{560 + 160}{1000} = \\frac{720}{1000} = 0.72$$\n\n#### 2. HWE-Expected Genotype Counts\n\nUsing the MLE $\\hat{p} = 0.72$, we find the frequency of allele $a$:\n$$\\hat{q} = 1 - \\hat{p} = 1 - 0.72 = 0.28$$\nThe expected genotype proportions under HWE are:\n$$P(AA) = \\hat{p}^2 = (0.72)^2 = 0.5184$$\n$$P(Aa) = 2\\hat{p}\\hat{q} = 2(0.72)(0.28) = 0.4032$$\n$$P(aa) = \\hat{q}^2 = (0.28)^2 = 0.0784$$\nThe expected genotype counts ($E$) in a sample of size $N=500$ are:\n$$E_{AA} = N \\times P(AA) = 500 \\times 0.5184 = 259.2$$\n$$E_{Aa} = N \\times P(Aa) = 500 \\times 0.4032 = 201.6$$\n$$E_{aa} = N \\times P(aa) = 500 \\times 0.0784 = 39.2$$\n\n#### 3. Pearson Chi-Square Test Statistic\n\nThe Pearson chi-square ($\\chi^2$) statistic is calculated as the sum of squared differences between observed ($O$) and expected ($E$) counts, each divided by the expected count:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i \\in \\{AA, Aa, aa\\}} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\nThe observed counts are $O_{AA}=280$, $O_{Aa}=160$, and $O_{aa}=60$.\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(280 - 259.2)^2}{259.2} + \\frac{(160 - 201.6)^2}{201.6} + \\frac{(60 - 39.2)^2}{39.2}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(20.8)^2}{259.2} + \\frac{(-41.6)^2}{201.6} + \\frac{(20.8)^2}{39.2}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{432.64}{259.2} + \\frac{1730.56}{201.6} + \\frac{432.64}{39.2}$$\n$$\\chi^2 \\approx 1.66914 + 8.58413 + 11.03673 \\approx 21.28999$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the test statistic is $21.29$.\n\n#### Commentary on the Result\nThe degrees of freedom for this goodness-of-fit test are given by $df = (\\text{number of genotype categories}) - 1 - (\\text{number of estimated parameters})$. Here, $df = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$. The critical value for a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $1$ degree of freedom at a conventional significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$ is $3.84$. Our calculated statistic of $\\chi^2 \\approx 21.29$ vastly exceeds this threshold. This indicates that the probability of observing such a large deviation from HWE expectations due to random sampling variation alone is extremely low ($p \\ll 0.001$). Therefore, the discrepancy strongly suggests that the HWE model is a poor fit for the data.\n\nThe form of the deviation provides clues to the underlying cause. We observe a deficit of heterozygotes ($O_{Aa}=160$ vs. $E_{Aa}=201.6$) and a corresponding excess of both homozygote classes ($O_{AA}=280$ vs. $E_{AA}=259.2$ and $O_{aa}=60$ vs. $E_{aa}=39.2$). This specific pattern is the classic signature of processes that increase homozygosity above random-mating expectations, such as inbreeding (consanguineous mating) or population substructure (the Wahlund effect, where the sample is a mixture of distinct subpopulations with different allele frequencies). Given the large sample size, the deviation is not a statistical fluke but rather strong evidence for a violation of one or more HWE assumptions in this population.",

            "problem": "In quality control for genome-wide association study data, the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test is routinely applied at each biallelic locus to detect deviations from random mating. Consider a sample of size $N = 1000$ with genotype counts $n_{AA} = 995$, $n_{Aa} = 5$, and $n_{aa} = 0$ for alleles $A$ and $a$. Let the observed minor-allele count be $m = 2 n_{aa} + n_{Aa}$.\n\nStarting from first principles of the Hardy–Weinberg principle (random union of gametes, with genotype probabilities $p^{2}$, $2 p (1-p)$, and $(1-p)^{2}$ for $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, respectively, at allele-$A$ frequency $p$), and using only basic combinatorics and conditioning arguments, perform the following:\n\n1) Derive the conditional probability mass function for the number of heterozygotes $H$ given the observed minor-allele count $M = m$ and sample size $N$, by enumerating all pairings of $2N$ alleles consistent with $M = m$ and counting the number of pairings that yield $H = h$ heterozygotes.

Do not include any units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part analysis based on the principles of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) exact test.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Conditional Probability Mass Function**\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle assumes that under random mating, the probability of a specific configuration of genotype counts $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa})$ in a sample of size $N$, given a population allele frequency of $p$ for allele $A$ and $1-p$ for allele $a$, follows a multinomial distribution:\n$$ P(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa} | p) = \\frac{N!}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} (p^2)^{n_{AA}} (2p(1-p))^{n_{Aa}} ((1-p)^2)^{n_{aa}} $$\nWe can re-express the powers of $p$ and $1-p$. The total count of allele $A$ is $2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}$ and the total count of allele $a$ (the minor allele) is $M = 2n_{aa} + n_{Aa}$. The total number of alleles is $2N = (2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}) + (2n_{aa} + n_{Aa})$.\nLet the observed minor allele count be $m$. The probability becomes:\n$$ P(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa} | p) = \\frac{N! 2^{n_{Aa}}}{n_{AA}! n_{Aa}! n_{aa}!} p^{2N-m} (1-p)^m $$\nThe exact test for HWE conditions on the observed allele counts, thereby eliminating the nuisance parameter $p$. We need to find the conditional probability $P(n_{Aa}=h | M=m, N)$. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ P(n_{Aa}=h | M=m) = \\frac{P(n_{Aa}=h \\text{ and } M=m)}{P(M=m)} $$\nThe event $(n_{Aa}=h, M=m)$ for a fixed $N$ uniquely determines the full genotype counts: $n_{Aa}=h$, $n_{aa}=(m-h)/2$, and $n_{AA}=N-h-(m-h)/2$. The joint probability in the numerator is thus the multinomial probability derived above.\nThe denominator, $P(M=m)$, is the probability of observing $m$ minor alleles in a sample of $2N$ alleles. This follows a binomial distribution $B(2N, 1-p)$:\n$$ P(M=m) = \\binom{2N}{m} (1-p)^m p^{2N-m} $$\nDividing the two probabilities, the terms involving $p$ cancel out:\n$$ P(n_{Aa}=h | M=m, N) = \\frac{\\frac{N! 2^h}{n_{AA}! h! n_{aa}!} p^{2N-m} (1-p)^m}{\\binom{2N}{m} p^{2N-m} (1-p)^m} = \\frac{N! 2^h}{n_{AA}! h! n_{aa}!} \\frac{1}{\\binom{2N}{m}} $$\nThis can be interpreted combinatorially, as requested. The total number of ways to arrange $m$ minor alleles among $2N$ total allele slots is $\\binom{2N}{m}$. This is the size of our sample space conditional on $m$. The number of ways to obtain exactly $h$ heterozygotes is found by choosing $h$ individuals from $N$ to be heterozygous ($\\binom{N}{h}$), choosing which of the two allele slots gets the minor allele for each heterozygote ($2^h$), and from the remaining $N-h$ individuals, choosing $(m-h)/2$ to be homozygous for the minor allele ($\\binom{N-h}{(m-h)/2}$), as the remaining $m-h$ minor alleles must be paired up. The product gives the numerator:\n$$ P(H=h | M=m, N) = \\frac{\\binom{N}{h} 2^h \\binom{N-h}{(m-h)/2}}{\\binom{2N}{m}} $$\nExpanding the binomial coefficients into factorials gives the full expression:\n$$ P(H=h | M=m, N) = \\frac{N! 2^h m! (2N-m)!}{h! (\\frac{m-h}{2})! (N - \\frac{m+h}{2})! (2N)!} $$\nThe admissible values of $h$ are constrained by the requirement that all genotype counts be non-negative integers.\n1.  $h \\geq 0$.\n2.  $n_{aa} = (m-h)/2 \\geq 0 \\implies h \\leq m$.\n3.  $n_{aa}$ must be an integer, so $m-h$ must be even. This implies $h$ and $m$ must have the same parity.\n4.  $n_{AA} = N-h-n_{aa} = N-h-(m-h)/2 \\geq 0 \\implies 2N-2h-m+h \\geq 0 \\implies h \\leq 2N-m$.\nSo, $h$ can take values in $[0, \\min(m, 2N-m)]$ with the same parity as $m$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Exact P-value**\n\nFirst, we establish the parameters from the observed data:\n-   Sample size $N = 1000$.\n-   Genotype counts $n_{AA} = 995$, $n_{Aa} = 5$, $n_{aa} = 0$.\n-   Observed number of heterozygotes $h_{obs} = 5$.\n-   Observed minor allele count $m = 2n_{aa} + n_{Aa} = 2(0) + 5 = 5$.\n\nNext, we determine the support of the conditional distribution for the number of heterozygotes $H$, given $N=1000$ and $m=5$.\nThe admissible values of $h$ must have the same parity as $m=5$ (odd) and must be in the range $[0, \\min(5, 2000-5)] = [0, 5]$.\nThus, the feasible values for $h$ are $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$.\n\nThe P-value is defined as the sum of probabilities of all outcomes that are less than or equal in probability to the observed outcome. The observed outcome is $h_{obs}=5$. We must compare $P(H=1)$, $P(H=3)$, and $P(H=5)$.\nWe can use a recurrence relation for the probabilities:\n$$ \\frac{P(H=h-2)}{P(H=h)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{h(h-1)}{(n_{AA}(h)+1)(n_{aa}(h)+1)} $$\nwhere $n_{aa}(h) = (m-h)/2$ and $n_{AA}(h) = N-h-n_{aa}(h)$.\n\nThe possible configurations are:\n-   $h=5$: $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa}) = (995, 5, 0)$. This is the observed configuration.\n-   $h=3$: $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa}) = (996, 3, 1)$.\n-   $h=1$: $(n_{AA}, n_{Aa}, n_{aa}) = (997, 1, 2)$.\n\nLet's compute the probability ratios:\n-   For $h=5$: $n_{aa}(5)=0$, $n_{AA}(5)=995$. The ratio is for $h-2=3$:\n    $$ \\frac{P(H=3)}{P(H=5)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{(995+1)(0+1)} = \\frac{20}{4 \\cdot 996} = \\frac{5}{996} $$\n    Since $5/996  1$, we have $P(H=3)  P(H=5)$.\n-   For $h=3$: $n_{aa}(3)=1$, $n_{AA}(3)=996$. The ratio is for $h-2=1$:\n    $$ \\frac{P(H=1)}{P(H=3)} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3 \\cdot 2}{(996+1)(1+1)} = \\frac{6}{4 \\cdot 997 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{3}{4 \\cdot 997} = \\frac{0.75}{997} $$\n    Since $0.75/997  1$, we have $P(H=1)  P(H=3)$.\n\nThe ordering of probabilities is $P(H=5) > P(H=3) > P(H=1)$. The observed configuration, $h=5$, is the most probable outcome under the null hypothesis.\n\nThe P-value is the sum of probabilities of all feasible outcomes whose probability is less than or equal to that of the observed outcome, $h_{obs}=5$.\n$$ P\\text{-value} = \\sum_{h \\in \\{1,3,5\\} : P(H=h) \\leq P(H=5)} P(H=h) $$\nSince $P(H=5)$ is the maximum probability, all feasible outcomes satisfy this condition.\n$$ P\\text{-value} = P(H=1) + P(H=3) + P(H=5) $$\nThis is the sum of probabilities over the entire support of the conditional probability mass function, which must, by definition, be equal to $1$. The data show no evidence of deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; in fact, the observed genotype counts are the most likely configuration given the allele counts.\nRounding to four significant figures, the P-value is $1.000$.\n\n**Part 3: Unreliability of Asymptotic Approximations**\n\nAsymptotic statistical tests, such as the Pearson $\\chi^2$-test, are unreliable in this setting for several fundamental reasons, all stemming from the low minor-allele count. These tests rely on the assumption that the test statistic's sampling distribution is well approximated by a continuous distribution (e.g., $\\chi^2$ or normal).\n\n1.  **Violation of Expected Count Assumptions**: The Pearson $\\chi^2$ test requires sufficiently large expected counts in each category for the approximation to be valid. In this problem, the estimated minor allele frequency is $\\hat{p}_a = m/(2N) = 5/2000 = 0.0025$. The expected count for the rare homozygous genotype is $E_{aa} = N \\hat{p}_a^2 = 1000 \\times (0.0025)^2 = 0.00625$. This value is far below the commonly cited minimum threshold of $5$, rendering the $\\chi^2$ approximation invalid.\n\n2.  **Extreme Discreteness of the Conditional Distribution**: As shown in Part 2, the conditional distribution of heterozygotes given $m=5$ has a support consisting of only three points: $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$. A continuous distribution cannot accurately approximate a probability distribution that is this sparse and discrete. The granularity of the exact distribution is too coarse.\n\n3.  **Parity Constraints**: The number of heterozygotes, $h$, must have the same parity as the minor allele count, $m$. This creates \"gaps\" in the support of the distribution (e.g., $h=2$ and $h=4$ are impossible outcomes for $m=5$). This structural feature further violates the notion of a continuous range of outcomes that underlies asymptotic approximations.\n\nIn summary, the low minor allele count leads to extremely small expected genotype counts and a highly discrete conditional distribution with a sparse support. These conditions severely violate the assumptions necessary for asymptotic tests to be reliable, necessitating the use of an exact test.",

            "problem": "You are to implement an exact conditional test for Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) at a single biallelic locus. The test must condition on the observed allele count and enumerate the distribution of heterozygote counts under the null hypothesis of HWE. The setting is a diploid sample of $n$ individuals with genotype counts $n_{\\text{AA}}$, $n_{\\text{Aa}}$, and $n_{\\text{aa}}$, where the two alleles are denoted by $\\text{A}$ and $\\text{a}$, and $n_{\\text{AA}} + n_{\\text{Aa}} + n_{\\text{aa}} = n$. The null hypothesis is that the population is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), meaning random mating and no forces such as selection, mutation, migration, or genotyping error that would alter genotype frequencies beyond those generated by allele frequencies alone.\n\nFundamental base: Under HWE, genotype frequencies in the population are determined only by allele frequencies, and in a sample they follow a multinomial model. When conditioning on the observed allele count $n_{\\text{A}} = 2 n_{\\text{AA}} + n_{\\text{Aa}}$ of allele $\\text{A}$ among the $2n$ gene copies, the distribution of how these $n_{\\text{A}}$ copies are paired into $n$ diploid genotypes is governed by random pairing of gene copies. All pairings of $2n$ gene copies into $n$ unordered pairs are equally likely under random mating.\n\nTask requirements:\n- Starting from the above definitions and assumptions, derive the admissible set of heterozygote counts $h$ that are compatible with the fixed allele count $n_{\\text{A}}$ and the sample size $n$, and derive the conditional probability mass function for the heterozygote count $H$ under HWE, that is, the probability $\\Pr(H = h \\mid n_{\\text{A}}, n)$ for each admissible $h$.\n- Implement a program that, for each test case, computes:\n  1.

Do not use asymptotic approximations; the computation must be exact up to machine precision by working in the log-domain to avoid numerical overflow.\n- Ensure that the program handles degenerate cases correctly, including monomorphic samples where all gene copies are the same allele. Note that due to the discrete nature of the distribution, the exact two-sided p-value is conservative, and the mid-$P$ value may be preferable in some contexts; your solution should explain when this is the case.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide results for the following five test cases, each specified by $(n_{\\text{AA}}, n_{\\text{Aa}}, n_{\\text{aa}})$:\n1. $(30, 10, 10)$ with $n = 50$ and $n_{\\text{A}} = 2 \\cdot 30 + 10 = 70$.\n2. $(0, 10, 0)$ with $n = 10$ and $n_{\\text{A}} = 2 \\cdot 0 + 10 = 10$.\n3. $(20, 0, 0)$ with $n = 20$ and $n_{\\text{A}} = 2 \\cdot 20 + 0 = 40$ (monomorphic).\n4. $(1, 3, 1)$ with $n = 5$ and $n_{\\text{A}} = 2 \\cdot 1 + 3 = 5$.\n5. $(40, 4, 6)$ with $n = 50$ and $n_{\\text{A}} = 2 \\cdot 40 + 4 = 84$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing, for the five test cases in order, the exact two-sided p-values and the mid-$P$ two-sided p-values, flattened into a single list. That is, the output must be a single Python-style list in the form $[p_{1,\\text{exact}}, p_{1,\\text{mid}}, p_{2,\\text{exact}}, p_{2,\\text{mid}}, p_{3,\\text{exact}}, p_{3,\\text{mid}}, p_{4,\\text{exact}}, p_{4,\\text{mid}}, p_{5,\\text{exact}}, p_{5,\\text{mid}}]$, where each entry is a real number in $[0,1]$.",
            "solution": "We begin from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) principle. Under HWE, genotype frequencies are determined by allele frequencies, and in a finite sample the genotype counts follow a multinomial distribution based on those frequencies. When conditioning on the observed allele count $n_{\\text{A}}$ among the $2n$ gene copies, the random mating assumption implies that all allocations of $n_{\\text{A}}$ copies of allele $\\text{A}$ into the $2n$ gene-copy slots are equally likely, and the gene copies are paired uniformly at random into $n$ unordered diploid genotypes. Therefore, the conditional distribution of genotype counts given $n_{\\text{A}}$ arises from counting the number of equiprobable pairings that result in a given configuration.\n\nLet the observed genotypes be $n_{\\text{AA}}$, $n_{\\text{Aa}}$, and $n_{\\text{aa}}$, with $n_{\\text{AA}} + n_{\\text{Aa}} + n_{\\text{aa}} = n$ and $n_{\\text{A}} = 2 n_{\\text{AA}} + n_{\\text{Aa}}$. Under the conditional framework, it is sufficient to consider the heterozygote count $H = n_{\\text{Aa}}$. For any fixed $n$ and $n_{\\text{A}}$, the heterozygote count $h$ determines the homozygote counts uniquely:\n$$\nn_{\\text{AA}}(h) = \\frac{n_{\\text{A}} - h}{2}, \\quad n_{\\text{aa}}(h) = \\frac{2n - n_{\\text{A}} - h}{2}.\n$$\nThese must be nonnegative integers, which imposes the following constraints on $h$:\n1. $h$ must be an integer with the same parity as $n_{\\text{A}}$ (so that $n_{\\text{A}} - h$ and $2n - n_{\\text{A}} - h$ are even).\n2. $0 \\leq h \\leq \\min(n_{\\text{A}}, 2n - n_{\\text{A}})$ (to ensure $n_{\\text{AA}}(h) \\geq 0$ and $n_{\\text{aa}}(h) \\geq 0$).\n\nHence, the admissible set of $h$ values is\n$$\n\\mathcal{H} = \\{ h \\in \\mathbb{Z} : h \\equiv n_{\\text{A}} \\ (\\text{mod } 2), \\ 0 \\leq h \\leq \\min(n_{\\text{A}}, 2n - n_{\\text{A}}) \\}.\n$$\nUnder random mating and conditioning on $n_{\\text{A}}$, all allocations of the $n_{\\text{A}}$ copies of allele $\\text{A}$ among the $2n$ slots are equally likely, so the total number of allocations is $\\binom{2n}{n_{\\text{A}}}$. For a given admissible $h$, the number of allocations that produce exactly $n_{\\text{AA}}(h)$ $\\text{AA}$ homozygotes, $h$ heterozygotes, and $n_{\\text{aa}}(h)$ $\\text{aa}$ homozygotes is\n$$\nW(h) = \\frac{n!}{n_{\\text{AA}}(h)! \\, h! \\, n_{\\text{aa}}(h)!} \\cdot 2^{h}.\n$$\nThe factor $2^{h}$ accounts for the fact that each heterozygous genotype $\\text{Aa}$ can be formed by two different allocations of an $\\text{A}$ gene copy and an $\\text{a}$ gene copy within the pair, whereas homozygote pairs have only one allocation. Therefore, the conditional probability mass function under HWE for $H$ given $n_{\\text{A}}$ and $n$ is\n$$\np(h) = \\Pr(H = h \\mid n, n_{\\text{A}}) = \\frac{W(h)}{\\sum_{h' \\in \\mathcal{H}} W(h')},\n$$\nwhich can equivalently be written as $p(h) = W(h) / \\binom{2n}{n_{\\text{A}}}$, but computing via $W(h)$ normalized by the sum $\\sum_{h' \\in \\mathcal{H}} W(h')$ is numerically stable and avoids direct manipulation of very large binomial coefficients.\n\nGiven an observed heterozygote count $h_{\\text{obs}} = n_{\\text{Aa}}$, the exact two-sided p-value based on the probability metric (often recommended to avoid ambiguity in tail selection for two-sided tests in discrete settings) is computed as\n$$\np_{\\text{exact}} = \\sum_{h \\in \\mathcal{H} : p(h) \\leq p(h_{\\text{obs}})} p(h).\n$$\nThe mid-$P$ two-sided p-value is defined to reduce the conservativeness induced by discreteness:\n$$\np_{\\text{mid}} = \\left( \\sum_{h : p(h)  p(h_{\\text{obs}})} p(h) \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_{h : p(h) = p(h_{\\text{obs}})} p(h) \\right).\n$$\nBoth $p_{\\text{exact}}$ and $p_{\\text{mid}}$ lie in $[0,1]$, though $p_{\\text{mid}}$ can be strictly smaller than $p_{\\text{exact}}$. In the degenerate case where $\\mathcal{H}$ contains a single value (for example, a monomorphic sample), one has $p(h_{\\text{obs}}) = 1$, which yields $p_{\\text{exact}} = 1$ and $p_{\\text{mid}} = \\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n1. For each test case, compute $n = n_{\\text{AA}} + n_{\\text{Aa}} + n_{\\text{aa}}$, $n_{\\text{A}} = 2 n_{\\text{AA}} + n_{\\text{Aa}}$, and $h_{\\text{obs}} = n_{\\text{Aa}}$.\n2. Enumerate $\\mathcal{H}$ using parity and bounds: set $h_{\\min}$ to $0$ if $n_{\\text{A}}$ is even or $1$ if $n_{\\text{A}}$ is odd, and $h_{\\max} = \\min(n_{\\text{A}}, 2n - n_{\\text{A}})$, then list $h$ from $h_{\\min}$ to $h_{\\max}$ in steps of $2$.\n3. For each $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$, compute $n_{\\text{AA}}(h)$ and $n_{\\text{aa}}(h)$, then compute $\\log W(h)$ using the log-factorial identity $\\log(k!) = \\log\\Gamma(k+1)$ to avoid overflow. Specifically,\n$$\n\\log W(h) = \\log(n!) - \\log(n_{\\text{AA}}(h)!) - \\log(h!) - \\log(n_{\\text{aa}}(h)!) + h \\log 2.\n$$\n4. Normalize to obtain $p(h)$ via a log-sum-exp computation: if $\\ell(h) = \\log W(h)$, then\n$$\np(h) = \\exp\\left(\\ell(h) - \\log\\left(\\sum_{h' \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\exp(\\ell(h'))\\right)\\right),\n$$\nwhich is implemented stably using the standard $\\log$-sum-exp trick.\n5. Compute $p_{\\text{exact}}$ by summing $p(h)$ for all $h$ with $p(h) \\leq p(h_{\\text{obs}})$. Compute $p_{\\text{mid}}$ by summing probabilities for outcomes strictly less probable than the observed one ($p_{}$) and adding half the sum of probabilities for outcomes exactly as probable as observed ($p_{=}$).\n6. Return the pair $(p_{\\text{acted}}, p_{\\text{mid}})$ for each test case.\n\nWhen mid-$P$ is preferable:\nMid-$P$ is often preferable in large-scale discrete testing contexts where exact p-values are overly conservative due to the discreteness of the test statistic. In population-genetic analyses across many loci (for example, genome-wide association studies or quality control of genotypes), the conservative nature of exact tests can reduce power to detect genuine deviations from HWE, particularly heterozygote deficiencies suggestive of genotyping errors or inbreeding. Mid-$P$ reduces this conservativeness by effectively splitting the probability mass of the observed outcome, providing better calibration of type I error rates and increased power while retaining the exact finite-sample enumeration. However, mid-$P$ is not uniformly conservative and may not be appropriate for interval estimation contexts or when strict control of the family-wise error rate is required in small samples. In degenerate cases with a single admissible outcome (for example, monomorphic data), mid-$P$ yields $0.5$, whereas the exact p-value is $1.0$, underscoring that mid-$P$ should be interpreted with care in such boundary conditions.\n\nThe final program implements the above algorithm and outputs a single flat list of the exact two-sided and mid-$P$ two-sided p-values for the specified test suite, in the required one-line format.",
