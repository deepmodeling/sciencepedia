In class I Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) presentation, positions $2$ and $9$ of a $9$-mer often act as anchors. Consider the $9$-mer peptide sequence $KILGNVYVL$ (positions indexed from $1$ to $9$). Under a simple, physically motivated additive model grounded in equilibrium statistical thermodynamics, the binding free energy $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $ is approximated as a sum of position-specific contributions from amino acids at each position, and the effect of a substitution at a position is the change in that position’s contribution to $ \\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} $; contributions from unchanged positions can be treated as constant with respect to the substitution.\n\nYou are given the following calibrated, position-specific contributions (in $\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$) for HLA-A$^{\\ast}02{:}01$ anchor positions, interpreted as the contribution of the amino acid at that position to the peptide–MHC binding free energy.

It uses a simplified but common and valid approach in bioinformatics and computational immunology, namely a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) to estimate peptide-MHC binding free energy. The concepts of anchor residues, HLA alleles, and additive free energy models are central to the field.\n    -   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (the peptide sequence, the specific mutations, and a complete table of energy contributions for the relevant amino acids and positions). The model is explicitly defined.\n    -   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n3.  **Verdict**: The problem is valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of the change in binding free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G$, for a double substitution in a $9$-mer peptide binding to the HLA-A$^{\\ast}02{:}01$ molecule.\n\nThe wild-type peptide sequence is given as $KILGNVYVL$. We index the positions from $1$ to $9$. The amino acid at position $2$ is isoleucine ($I$), and the amino acid at position $9$ is leucine ($L$).\n\nThe double substitution replaces these anchor residues with alanine ($A$). The mutant peptide therefore has alanine at positions $2$ and $9$.\n\nThe total binding free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}}$, is modeled as an additive sum of position-specific contributions:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{bind}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} \\varepsilon_{i}(\\text{AA}_i)\n$$\nwhere $\\text{AA}_i$ is the amino acid at position $i$ and $\\varepsilon_{i}(\\cdot)$ is the contribution of that amino acid at that position to the free energy.\n\nFor the wild-type (WT) peptide, the binding free energy is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{WT}} = \\varepsilon_2(I) + \\varepsilon_9(L) + \\sum_{i \\in \\{1,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}} \\varepsilon_{i}(\\text{AA}_i)\n$$\nThe sum represents the contribution from all non-anchor positions. Let us denote this constant sum as $C$:\n$$\nC = \\sum_{i \\in \\{1,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}} \\varepsilon_{i}(\\text{AA}_i)\n$$\nSo, $\\Delta G_{\\text{WT}} = \\varepsilon_2(I) + \\varepsilon_9(L) + C$.\n\nFor the mutant (MT) peptide, the anchor residues are replaced by alanine ($A$). The binding free energy is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{MT}} = \\varepsilon_2(A) + \\varepsilon_9(A) + \\sum_{i \\in \\{1,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}} \\varepsilon_{i}(\\text{AA}_i)\n$$\nSince the residues at non-anchor positions are unchanged, their contribution is the same constant $C$.\nSo, $\\Delta G_{\\text{MT}} = \\varepsilon_2(A) + \\varepsilon_9(A) + C$.\n\nThe change in binding free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G$, is defined as $\\Delta G_{\\text{MT}} - \\Delta G_{\\text{WT}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = (\\varepsilon_2(A) + \\varepsilon_9(A) + C) - (\\varepsilon_2(I) + \\varepsilon_9(L) + C)\n$$\nThe constant term $C$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = (\\varepsilon_2(A) - \\varepsilon_2(I)) + (\\varepsilon_9(A) - \\varepsilon_9(L))\n$$\nThis expression shows that the total change in binding energy is the sum of the changes at each substituted position, consistent with the stated independence of the substitutions.\n\nLet's define the change for each position separately:\n$\\Delta\\Delta G_2 = \\varepsilon_2(A) - \\varepsilon_2(I)$\n$\\Delta\\Delta G_9 = \\varepsilon_9(A) - \\varepsilon_9(L)$\nSo, $\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta\\Delta G_2 + \\Delta\\Delta G_9$.\n\nWe now use the given energy contribution values (in $\\mathrm{kcal/mol}$).\n\nFor the substitution at position $2$ ($I \\to A$):\n- Contribution of isoleucine ($I$): $\\varepsilon_2(I) = -1.8$\n- Contribution of alanine ($A$): $\\varepsilon_2(A) = +0.4$\n\nThe change at position $2$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_2 = (+0.4) - (-1.8) = 0.4 + 1.8 = 2.2 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/mol}\n$$\n\nFor the substitution at position $9$ ($L \\to A$):\n- Contribution of leucine ($L$): $\\varepsilon_9(L) = -1.8$\n- Contribution of alanine ($A$): $\\varepsilon_9(A) = -1.0$\n\nThe change at position $9$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G_9 = (-1.0) - (-1.8) = -1.0 + 1.8 = 0.8 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/mol}\n$$\n\nThe total change in binding free energy is the sum of the individual changes:\n$$\n\\Delta\\Delta G = \\Delta\\Delta G_2 + \\Delta\\Delta G_9 = 2.2 + 0.8 = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{kcal/mol}\n$$\nThe positive value of $\\Delta\\Delta G$ indicates that the double mutation is predicted to be destabilizing, making the peptide-MHC binding less favorable.",

The goal is to select a subset of peptides to include in a peptide-based cancer vaccine, subject to a vaccine amino acid length budget $B$, to maximize expected immunogenicity while discouraging redundant selections that are highly similar by sequence. The problem is to compute the optimal subset under the following mathematically specified model and constraints, for multiple test cases.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology asserts that protein expression scales with transcript abundance; therefore higher $TPM$ can increase peptide presentation.\n- Stronger binding to MHC generally increases the likelihood of peptide presentation; lower $IC50$ implies stronger binding.\n- Immunogenicity can be modeled via a logistic link function (sigmoid) of a linear score combining features, which is a well-tested approach in biostatistics for binary outcomes.\n- Expected immunogenicity of a set can be approximated by the sum of individual probabilities when events are modeled as independent Bernoulli random variables.\n- Redundancy due to sequence similarity (for example, overlapping epitopes competing for the same T-cell clones) can be penalized via a pairwise term scaled by a similarity score in $[0,1]$.\n\nFor each peptide $i$ with features $IC50_i$ (in nanomolar), $E_i$ (in $TPM$), $VAF_i$ (decimal in $[0,1]$), and $P_i$ (processing probability in $[0,1]$), define the linear score\n$$\nz_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{\\mathrm{aff}} \\log\\left(\\frac{500}{IC50_i}\\right) + \\beta_{\\mathrm{expr}} \\log\\left(1 + E_i\\right) + \\beta_{\\mathrm{vaf}} \\cdot VAF_i + \\beta_{\\mathrm{proc}} \\cdot P_i,\n$$\nwhere $\\log$ is the natural logarithm. The expected probability of immunogenicity for peptide $i$ is then\n$$\np_i = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z_i)}.\n$$\nGiven a symmetric similarity matrix $S$ with entries $s_{ij} \\in [0,1]$ and $s_{ii} = 0$ for all $i$, and a redundancy penalty coefficient $\\lambda \\ge 0$, define the objective to maximize over binary selections $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$:\n$$\n\\text{maximize} \\quad \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i p_i \\;-\\; \\lambda \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} x_i x_j s_{ij},\n$$\nsubject to the budget constraint\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\cdot l_i \\le B,\n$$\nwhere $l_i$ is the amino acid length of peptide $i$ and $B$ is the vaccine length budget in amino acids.\n\nTie-breaking rule: If multiple subsets achieve the same objective value (within numerical tolerance), select the lexicographically smallest index list when indices are ordered increasingly (for example, prefer $[0,1]$ over $[0,2]$).\n\nModel coefficients (used identically across all test cases):\n- $\\beta_0 = -3.0$,\n- $\\beta_{\\mathrm{aff}} = 1.4$,\n- $\\beta_{\\mathrm{expr}} = 0.7$,\n- $\\beta_{\\mathrm{vaf}} = 0.6$,\n- $\\beta_{\\mathrm{proc}} = 1.1$.\n\nAll logarithms are natural logarithms (base $e$). $IC50$ must be in nanomolar (nM). $TPM$ and $VAF$ must be provided as decimals with no percentage signs. The penalty coefficient $\\lambda$ is unitless.\n\nYour program must solve the above optimization exactly for each of the following test cases.

            "solution": "The provided problem is a well-defined and scientifically grounded optimization task situated in the field of computational immunology and bioinformatics. It asks for the selection of an optimal subset of neoantigen peptides for a cancer vaccine, maximizing a score for expected immunogenicity while penalizing redundancy and adhering to a budget constraint.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Verdict: Valid**\n\nThe problem is validated as follows:\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem formulation is based on established principles in immunology and biostatistics. The features used ($IC50$, $TPM$, $VAF$, $P_i$) are standard metrics for neoantigen prioritization. The use of a logistic function to model immunogenicity probability from a linear combination of features is a standard practice (logistic regression). The penalization of sequence similarity is a rational approach to increase the breadth of the induced immune response.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is a 0-1 quadratic integer programming problem, a known class of optimization problems. The objective function and constraints are specified with mathematical precision. The number of peptides $n$ in each test case is small (maximum $n=6$), which makes the problem computationally tractable via exhaustive search. The inclusion of a tie-breaking rule ensures that a unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objective and Complete**: The problem statement is objective, employing precise mathematical language. All necessary data, including model coefficients, peptide features, length/budget constraints, and similarity matrices, are provided for each test case, making the problem self-contained and solvable.\n\n### Solution Methodology\n\nThe problem can be modeled as a 0-1 Quadratic Knapsack Problem (QKP). Let $x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be a decision variable, where $x_i=1$ if peptide $i$ is selected and $x_i=0$ otherwise. The task is to find the vector $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$ that solves the following optimization problem.\n\nFirst, the immunogenicity probability $p_i$ for each peptide $i$ is derived from its feature-based linear score $z_i$.\nThe linear score $z_i$ is given by:\n$$\nz_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{\\mathrm{aff}} \\log\\left(\\frac{500}{IC50_i}\\right) + \\beta_{\\mathrm{expr}} \\log\\left(1 + E_i\\right) + \\beta_{\\mathrm{vaf}} \\cdot VAF_i + \\beta_{\\mathrm{proc}} \\cdot P_i\n$$\nThe probability of immunogenicity $p_i$ is then calculated using the standard logistic (sigmoid) function:\n$$\np_i = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z_i)}\n$$\nThe objective is to maximize the function $F(x)$, which represents the total expected immunogenicity minus a redundancy penalty:\n$$\n\\text{maximize}_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n} \\quad F(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i p_i \\;-\\; \\lambda \\sum_{1 \\le i < j \\le n} x_i x_j s_{ij}\n$$\nThis maximization is subject to a budget constraint on the total length of the selected peptides:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\cdot l_i \\le B\n$$\nGiven the small number of peptides $n$ in each test case (ranging from $3$ to $6$), an exact solution can be found by complete enumeration of all $2^n$ possible subsets.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Pre-computation of Probabilities**: For each peptide $i$ in a given test case, the immunogenicity probability $p_i$ is calculated and stored. These values depend only on the peptide's own features and are constant throughout the optimization for that case.\n\n2.  **Exhaustive Subset Search**: The algorithm iterates through all possible subsets of the $n$ peptides. Each integer from $0$ to $2^n-1$ can be used to represent a unique subset, where the $i$-th bit of the integer's binary representation corresponds to the selection status of peptide $i$.\n\n3.  **Constraint Validation**: For each generated subset, the total length of its peptides, $\\sum x_i l_i$, is computed. If this sum exceeds the budget $B$, the subset is deemed infeasible and is discarded from consideration.\n\n4.  **Objective Function Evaluation**: For each feasible subset, the objective function $F(x)$ is calculated. This involves summing the pre-computed probabilities $p_i$ for all selected peptides ($x_i=1$) and subtracting the penalty term, which is the sum of similarities $s_{ij}$ for all pairs of selected peptides, scaled by the coefficient $\\lambda$.\n\n5.  **Identification of Optimal Subset**: The algorithm maintains the subset with the highest objective value found so far.\n    - A variable `best_objective` is initialized to $-\\infty$ and a list `best_subset_indices` is initialized as empty.\n    - As each feasible subset is evaluated, if its objective value is greater than `best_objective` (within a numerical tolerance of $10^{-9}$), `best_objective` is updated and `best_subset_indices` is replaced with the indices of the current subset.\n    - If a subset's objective value is equal to `best_objective` (within the tolerance), the tie-breaking rule is invoked: the current subset's index list is compared lexicographically to `best_subset_indices`, and the smaller one is kept.\n\nThis procedure guarantees finding the exact optimal subset according to the problem's specification. The process is repeated for each of the five test cases, and the resulting lists of indices are aggregated into the final required format.",
