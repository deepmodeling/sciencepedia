            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is a scientifically grounded and well-posed problem in applied probability theory, specifically within the context of medical diagnostics and epidemiology. All necessary data are provided, and the objective is clearly defined. The task is to derive the posterior probability of a condition (child abuse) given a positive test result, using fundamental principles of probability.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that a child has been subjected to physical abuse, and let $A^c$ be the complementary event that the child has not been abused. Let $T^+$ be the event that the screening tool returns a positive result. The problem requires the calculation of the posterior probability $P(A \\mid T^+)$, which is the probability of abuse given a positive test.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The community prevalence of physical abuse is the prior probability of event $A$.\n    $$ P(A) = 0.02 $$\n2.  The probability of no abuse is the complement of the prevalence.\n    $$ P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98 $$\n3.  The sensitivity of the tool is the probability of a positive test result given that abuse is present.\n    $$ P(T^+ \\mid A) = 0.85 $$\n4.  The specificity of the tool is the probability of a negative test result given that abuse is absent.\n    $$ P(T^- \\mid A^c) = 0.95 $$\n    From the specificity, we can determine the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test result given that abuse is absent.\n    $$ P(T^+ \\mid A^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid A^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nThe derivation of the posterior probability $P(A \\mid T^+)$ begins with the definition of conditional probability, which is rearranged to form Bayes' theorem.\nBy definition, $P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(A \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$.\nAlso by definition, $P(T^+ \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap T^+)}{P(A)}$, which implies $P(A \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid A) P(A)$.\nSubstituting this into the first equation yields Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid A) P(A)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result, irrespective of the true abuse status. This probability is calculated using the law of total probability. The events $A$ and $A^c$ form a partition of the sample space. Therefore, the event $T^+$ can be decomposed into two mutually exclusive events: a positive test in an abused child ($T^+ \\cap A$) and a positive test in a non-abused child ($T^+ \\cap A^c$).\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap A) + P(T^+ \\cap A^c) $$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability again, we can express these joint probabilities as:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid A)P(A) + P(T^+ \\mid A^c)P(A^c) $$\nThe term $P(T^+ \\mid A)P(A)$ represents the probability of a true positive, while the term $P(T^+ \\mid A^c)P(A^c)$ represents the probability of a false positive.\n\nSubstituting this expansion for $P(T^+)$ into Bayes' theorem provides the full expression for the posterior probability, derived from first principles:\n$$ P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid A) P(A)}{P(T^+ \\mid A)P(A) + P(T^+ \\mid A^c)P(A^c)} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$$ P(A) = 0.02 $$\n$$ P(A^c) = 0.98 $$\n$$ P(T^+ \\mid A) = 0.85 $$\n$$ P(T^+ \\mid A^c) = 0.05 $$\n$$ P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.02)}{(0.85)(0.02) + (0.05)(0.98)} $$\n\nWe compute the numerator and denominator separately.\nNumerator (probability of a true positive):\n$$ (0.85)(0.02) = 0.017 $$\nDenominator (total probability of a positive test):\n$$ (0.85)(0.02) + (0.05)(0.98) = 0.017 + 0.049 = 0.066 $$\n\nThus, the posterior probability is:\n$$ P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.017}{0.066} $$\n$$ P(A \\mid T^+) = \\frac{17}{66} \\approx 0.25757575... $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $7$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$ P(A \\mid T^+) \\approx 0.2576 $$\nThis result, known as the positive predictive value (PPV), indicates that even with a fairly sensitive and specific screening tool, a positive result in a low-prevalence population yields a surprisingly low probability of the condition actually being present.",

            "introduction": "Building on the concept of predictive value, this practice explores a critical variable: the prevalence, or base rate, of a condition in a given population. You will compare the performance of the exact same screening test in a general population versus a high-risk referral clinic.

            "problem": "A pediatric system deploys a brief, validated sexual abuse risk screen during encounters. The test has known operating characteristics: sensitivity $0.90$ and specificity $0.95$. Consider two implementation settings with different base rates of sexual abuse: Setting $1$ is a universal school-based screening program where the prevalence is $0.02$; Setting $2$ is a specialized referral clinic where the prevalence is $0.20$. Clinicians must decide whether to file a report to Child Protective Services (CPS) on the basis of the screen and clinical assessment. Using only standard definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and the general relationship between conditional and joint probabilities, compare the PPV of the same test across these settings and reason about the consequences of base-rate neglect. Select all statements that are most accurate, given these data and the principles above.\n\nA. In Setting $1$ with prevalence $0.02$, the PPV is approximately $0.27$, and in Setting $2$ with prevalence $0.20$, the PPV is approximately $0.82$. Therefore, if clinicians ignore base rates in Setting $1$, they are likely to overdiagnose and overreport to CPS on the basis of a positive screen.\n\nB. Because specificity is $0.95$, the false positive rate is negligible regardless of prevalence, so the PPV will be roughly the same in both settings.\n\nC. In the higher-prevalence referral clinic (Setting $2$), base-rate neglect could manifest as underdiagnosis if clinicians overvalue a negative screen, because the NPV is lower there than in Setting $1$.\n\nD. Mandated reporting statutes require proof beyond a reasonable doubt before reporting; thus it is appropriate in Setting $1$ to delay reporting until confirmatory forensic evidence is available.\n\nE. If $10{,}000$ students are screened in Setting $1$, about $500$ will screen positive, and more than $350$ of those positives are expected to be true positives.",
            "solution": "Begin from core definitions. Sensitivity is $P(\\text{test}+\\mid \\text{abuse})$. Specificity is $P(\\text{test}-\\mid \\text{no abuse})$. Prevalence is $P(\\text{abuse})$. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is $P(\\text{abuse}\\mid \\text{test}+)$. By Bayes’ theorem applied to diagnostic testing, \n$$\n\\text{PPV}=\\frac{P(\\text{test}+\\mid \\text{abuse})P(\\text{abuse})}{P(\\text{test}+\\mid \\text{abuse})P(\\text{abuse})+P(\\text{test}+\\mid \\text{no abuse})P(\\text{no abuse})}.\n$$\nSubstitute $P(\\text{test}+\\mid \\text{abuse})=\\text{sensitivity}$ and $P(\\text{test}+\\mid \\text{no abuse})=1-\\text{specificity}$, and $P(\\text{no abuse})=1-P(\\text{abuse})$ to compute PPV in each setting.\n\nFor Setting $1$ (prevalence $0.02$):\n- Sensitivity $=0.90$.\n- Specificity $=0.95$ so $1-\\text{specificity}=0.05$.\n- Compute numerator: $0.90\\times 0.02=0.018$.\n- Compute denominator: $0.018+(0.05)\\times(1-0.02)=0.018+0.05\\times 0.98=0.018+0.049=0.067$.\n- Therefore $\\text{PPV}_{1}=0.018/0.067\\approx 0.2687\\approx 0.27$.\n\nFor Setting $2$ (prevalence $0.20$):\n- Sensitivity $=0.90$.\n- Specificity $=0.95$ so $1-\\text{specificity}=0.05$.\n- Numerator: $0.90\\times 0.20=0.18$.\n- Denominator: $0.18+(0.05)\\times(1-0.20)=0.18+0.05\\times 0.80=0.18+0.04=0.22$.\n- Therefore $\\text{PPV}_{2}=0.18/0.22\\approx 0.8182\\approx 0.82$.\n\nNegative Predictive Value (NPV) is $P(\\text{no abuse}\\mid \\text{test}-)$, which by Bayes’ theorem equals\n$$\n\\text{NPV}=\\frac{\\text{specificity}\\times (1-\\text{prevalence})}{\\text{specificity}\\times (1-\\text{prevalence})+(1-\\text{sensitivity})\\times \\text{prevalence}}.\n$$\nCompute NPV in both settings to reason about potential underdiagnosis when a negative screen is overvalued.\n\nSetting $1$ (prevalence $0.02$):\n- Numerator: $0.95\\times 0.98=0.931$.\n- Denominator: $0.931+(1-0.90)\\times 0.02=0.931+0.10\\times 0.02=0.931+0.002=0.933$.\n- $\\text{NPV}_{1}=0.931/0.933\\approx 0.998$.\n\nSetting $2$ (prevalence $0.20$):\n- Numerator: $0.95\\times 0.80=0.76$.\n- Denominator: $0.76+(1-0.90)\\times 0.20=0.76+0.10\\times 0.20=0.76+0.02=0.78$.\n- $\\text{NPV}_{2}=0.76/0.78\\approx 0.974$.\n\nThus the same test yields markedly different PPV across settings due to different base rates, while NPV remains high in both but is lower in the higher-prevalence setting.\n\nBase-rate neglect is the cognitive error of ignoring the prior probability $P(\\text{abuse})$ when interpreting a test result. In a low-prevalence setting, base-rate neglect leads clinicians to overestimate $P(\\text{abuse}\\mid \\text{test}+)$, inflating the perceived certainty of abuse for positive screens and risking overdiagnosis and unnecessary CPS reports. In a high-prevalence setting, base-rate neglect can appear as overreliance on a negative screen, underestimating residual risk and risking underdiagnosis.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option quantifies PPV in both settings using standard definitions. The calculations above yield $\\text{PPV}_{1}\\approx 0.27$ and $\\text{PPV}_{2}\\approx 0.82$. In Setting $1$, most positive screens are false positives, so ignoring the base rate would exaggerate certainty and promote overdiagnosis and overreporting to CPS. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This asserts that a false positive rate of $0.05$ is negligible regardless of prevalence and that PPV is roughly constant. This contradicts Bayes’ theorem: when prevalence is $0.02$, false positives among the much larger non-abused group dominate the positive pool, driving PPV down to approximately $0.27$. When prevalence is $0.20$, PPV rises to approximately $0.82$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This describes underdiagnosis risk in Setting $2$ if clinicians overvalue a negative screen. Because $\\text{NPV}_{2}\\approx 0.974$ is lower than $\\text{NPV}_{1}\\approx 0.998$, a negative result in the higher-prevalence setting leaves a higher post-test probability of abuse than in the school setting. Overweighting the negative result (ignoring the higher base rate) could cause missed cases. Verdict — Correct.\n\nD. This misstates the legal threshold for mandated reporting. Mandated reporters are typically required to report when they have reasonable suspicion or reasonable cause, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Delaying reporting until confirmatory forensic evidence is obtained conflicts with the statutory standard and risks harm. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. Validate with a contingency table for $10{,}000$ students in Setting $1$. Expected abused: $0.02\\times 10{,}000=200$. True positives: $0.90\\times 200=180$. Non-abused: $10{,}000-200=9{,}800$. False positives: $(1-0.95)\\times 9{,}800=0.05\\times 9{,}800=490$. Total positives: $180+490=670$. The statement claims about $500$ positives and more than $350$ true positives, both inconsistent with the computations. Verdict — Incorrect.",

Express the final posterior probability as an exact fraction. No rounding is required, and do not use the percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been analyzed and validated. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information and assumptions for a unique solution. The context provided is relevant to the field of pediatrics and represents a standard application of Bayesian inference in clinical decision-making. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the infant has abusive head trauma (AHT), and $D^c$ be the event that the infant does not have AHT.\nLet $M^+$ be the event of a positive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) result.\nLet $O^+$ be the event of a positive ophthalmologic examination result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\nThe pretest probability of AHT is $P(D) = 0.10$.\nThe pretest probability of not having AHT is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\nThe positive likelihood ratio for the MRI is $LR^{+}_{MRI} = 7$.\nThe positive likelihood ratio for the ophthalmologic exam is $LR^{+}_{Ophtho} = 5$.\nThe two tests are conditionally independent given the disease status.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the posterior probability of AHT given a positive result on both tests, which is denoted as $P(D|M^+ \\cap O^+)$. We must derive this from fundamental principles.\n\nFirst, we will establish the definition of the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$). For a given diagnostic test with a positive result $T^+$, the $LR^+$ is the ratio of the probability of a positive test result in a subject with the disease to the probability of a positive test result in a subject without the disease:\n$$\nLR^{+} = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)}\n$$\nThis ratio quantifies the evidential strength of a positive test result.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the combined evidential impact of the two positive tests. Given the assumption of conditional independence, the likelihood ratio for the combined event of two positive tests ($M^+$ and $O^+$) is the product of their individual likelihood ratios. We shall derive this explicitly.\nThe combined likelihood ratio, $LR^{+}_{comb}$, is defined as:\n$$\nLR^{+}_{comb} = \\frac{P(M^+ \\cap O^+ | D)}{P(M^+ \\cap O^+ | D^c)}\n$$\nThe assumption of conditional independence states that $P(M^+ \\cap O^+ | D) = P(M^+|D)P(O^+|D)$ and $P(M^+ \\cap O^+ | D^c) = P(M^+|D^c)P(O^+|D^c)$. Substituting these into the expression for $LR^{+}_{comb}$:\n$$\nLR^{+}_{comb} = \\frac{P(M^+|D)P(O^+|D)}{P(M^+|D^c)P(O^+|D^c)} = \\left(\\frac{P(M^+|D)}{P(M^+|D^c)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(O^+|D)}{P(O^+|D^c)}\\right)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the combined likelihood ratio is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR^{+}_{comb} = LR^{+}_{MRI} \\times LR^{+}_{Ophtho}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nLR^{+}_{comb} = 7 \\times 5 = 35\n$$\nThis value, $35$, represents the combined evidential impact of the two positive tests. A positive result on both tests is $35$ times more likely to occur in an infant with AHT than in an infant without AHT.\n\nNext, we update the pretest probability to the posterior probability using Bayesian updating, starting from the fundamental definition of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem). Let $E$ represent the combined evidence, i.e., $E = M^+ \\cap O^+$. We seek to calculate $P(D|E)$.\nAccording to Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(D|E) = \\frac{P(E|D)P(D)}{P(E)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of observing the evidence. It can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(E) = P(E|D)P(D) + P(E|D^c)P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting this expansion into Bayes' theorem gives the full form:\n$$\nP(D|E) = \\frac{P(E|D)P(D)}{P(E|D)P(D) + P(E|D^c)P(D^c)}\n$$\nTo incorporate the likelihood ratio, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by $P(E|D^c)$:\n$$\nP(D|E) = \\frac{\\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)} P(D)}{\\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)} P(D) + \\frac{P(E|D^c)}{P(E|D^c)} P(D^c)}\n$$\nBy definition, $\\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|D^c)} = LR^{+}_{comb}$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nP(D|E) = \\frac{LR^{+}_{comb} \\cdot P(D)}{LR^{+}_{comb} \\cdot P(D) + P(D^c)}\n$$\nThis formula correctly updates the pretest probability $P(D)$ to the posterior probability $P(D|E)$ using the combined likelihood ratio, and has been derived from first principles as required.\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values into this derived expression:\n$P(D) = 0.10$\n$P(D^c) = 0.90$\n$LR^{+}_{comb} = 35$\n\n$$\nP(D|M^+ \\cap O^+) = \\frac{35 \\times 0.10}{35 \\times 0.10 + 0.90}\n$$\n$$\nP(D|M^+ \\cap O^+) = \\frac{3.5}{3.5 + 0.9} = \\frac{3.5}{4.4}\n$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $10$:\n$$\nP(D|M^+ \\cap O^+) = \\frac{35}{44}\n$$\nThe integers $35$ and $44$ have prime factorizations of $5 \\times 7$ and $2^2 \\times 11$, respectively. They share no common factors, so the fraction is in its simplest form.\nThus, the posterior probability of abusive head trauma, after observing the positive MRI and ophthalmologic findings, is $\\frac{35}{44}$.",
