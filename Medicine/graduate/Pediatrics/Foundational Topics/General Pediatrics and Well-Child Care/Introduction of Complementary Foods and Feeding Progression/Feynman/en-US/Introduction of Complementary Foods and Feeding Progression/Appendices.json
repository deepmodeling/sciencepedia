            "problem": "An $8$-month-old infant weighing $9\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ is beginning complementary feeding while continuing to receive human milk. The pediatric nutrition goal is to meet the age-appropriate protein requirement using human milk plus complementary foods in a manner consistent with feeding progression and realistic intake. For infants aged $7$–$12$ months, the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is $1.2\\ \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$. On a representative day, the infant consumes human milk with a measured volume of $500\\ \\mathrm{mL}$ and a protein concentration of $0.8\\ \\mathrm{g}$ per $100\\ \\mathrm{mL}$. Complementary foods are offered in small, developmentally appropriate portions with observed plate waste during self-feeding: cooked lentils at lunch ($50\\ \\mathrm{g}$ offered; protein density $7\\ \\mathrm{g}/100\\ \\mathrm{g}$; waste fraction $0.30$), tofu at dinner ($20\\ \\mathrm{g}$ offered; protein density $8\\ \\mathrm{g}/100\\ \\mathrm{g}$; waste fraction $0.25$), and peanut butter at snack ($6\\ \\mathrm{g}$ offered; protein density $25\\ \\mathrm{g}/100\\ \\mathrm{g}$; waste fraction $0.10$). Assume protein density applies to the consumed portion, waste fractions remain constant when portion sizes change, and ignore differences in protein quality and digestibility for this calculation.\n\nUsing first principles, namely that protein requirement scales with body mass for this age group and that nutrient intake equals the product of concentration and mass consumed, determine the minimal additional grams of tofu that must be offered (keeping the tofu waste fraction the same as above) so that the infant’s total daily protein intake from human milk plus these complementary foods meets the RDA exactly. Round your final answer to three significant figures. Express your answer in grams ($\\mathrm{g}$).",
            "solution": "The objective is to determine the minimal additional mass of tofu, $\\Delta M_{T, offered}$, that must be offered to an infant to meet their daily protein requirement exactly. The solution will be derived by first calculating the total daily protein requirement, then calculating the current total protein intake from all sources, finding the deficit, and finally determining the amount of tofu needed to supply this deficit.\n\nFirst, we calculate the infant's total daily protein requirement, $P_{req}$. The requirement is based on the infant's body mass, $m = 9\\ \\mathrm{kg}$, and the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein, $R_{protein} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$.\n$$P_{req} = m \\cdot R_{protein} = (9\\ \\mathrm{kg}) \\cdot (1.2\\ \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}) = 10.8\\ \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{day}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the current total daily protein intake, $P_{total, initial}$, by summing the protein contributions from human milk and the three complementary foods as initially offered.\n\nThe protein from human milk, $P_{HM}$, is calculated from the consumed volume, $V_{HM} = 500\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, and the protein concentration, $C_{HM} = 0.8\\ \\mathrm{g} / 100\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$P_{HM} = V_{HM} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{C_{HM}}{100\\ \\mathrm{mL}}\\right) = 500\\ \\mathrm{mL} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{0.8\\ \\mathrm{g}}{100\\ \\mathrm{mL}}\\right) = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n\nThe protein intake from a complementary food is calculated from the mass offered, $M_{offered}$, the protein density, $D$ (in $\\mathrm{g}$ per $100\\ \\mathrm{g}$ of food), and the waste fraction, $W$. The mass consumed is $M_{consumed} = M_{offered} \\cdot (1 - W)$. The protein intake is $P = M_{consumed} \\cdot (D/100)$.\n\n1.

Let $\\Delta M_{T, offered}$ be the additional mass of tofu that must be offered. The protein provided by this additional amount, $\\Delta P_T$, is given by:\n$$\\Delta P_T = \\Delta M_{T, offered} \\cdot (1 - W_T) \\cdot \\frac{D_T}{100}$$\nWe set $\\Delta P_T$ equal to the protein deficit, $P_{deficit}$:\n$$1.80\\ \\mathrm{g} = \\Delta M_{T, offered} \\cdot (1 - 0.25) \\cdot \\frac{8}{100}$$\n$$1.80\\ \\mathrm{g} = \\Delta M_{T, offered} \\cdot (0.75) \\cdot (0.08)$$\n$$1.80\\ \\mathrm{g} = \\Delta M_{T, offered} \\cdot 0.06$$\n\nSolving for $\\Delta M_{T, offered}$:\n$$\\Delta M_{T, offered} = \\frac{1.80\\ \\mathrm{g}}{0.06} = 30\\ \\mathrm{g}$$\n\nThe calculated additional mass of tofu to be offered is exactly $30\\ \\mathrm{g}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n\nTherefore, the minimal additional grams of tofu that must be offered is $30.0\\ \\mathrm{g}$.",

When ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is co-ingested at dose $V$ (in $\\mathrm{mg}$), non-heme iron absorption follows a saturable dose-response that can be modeled as\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{nh}}(V)=f_{b}+\\left(f_{\\max}-f_{b}\\right)\\frac{V}{V+V_{50}},\n$$\nwith $f_{\\max}=0.20$ and $V_{50}=50\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n- Energy requirements: assume a body mass $m=7.8\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ and a daily energy requirement of $82\\ \\mathrm{kcal}$ per $\\mathrm{kg}$ per day.

            "problem": "A $9$-month-old infant with body weight $W = 9\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ is beginning complementary feeding. The clinical goal is to provide long-chain omega-$3$ polyunsaturated fatty acids—Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)—for neurodevelopment while keeping methylmercury exposure within the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Reference Dose (RfD) for methylmercury of $d = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/(kg\\,day)}$. The family plans to offer $n = 3$ seafood servings per week, each cooked portion of mass $m = 30\\,\\mathrm{g} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. Assume methylmercury exposure from a serving is proportional to the fish’s methylmercury concentration and the portion mass consumed, and assume weekly exposure is the sum of exposures from individual servings. The following data (typical cooked portions) are available:\n\n- Salmon (Atlantic, farmed): methylmercury concentration $c = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$; DHA+EPA content $b = 1500\\,\\mathrm{mg/100\\,g}$.\n- Sardines: $c = 0.013\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$; $b = 1200\\,\\mathrm{mg/100\\,g}$.\n- Rainbow trout (farmed): $c = 0.07\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$; $b = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg/100\\,g}$.\n- Light tuna: $c = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$; $b = 200\\,\\mathrm{mg/100\\,g}$.\n- Albacore tuna: $c = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$; $b = 700\\,\\mathrm{mg/100\\,g}$.\n- Swordfish: $c = 0.97\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$; $b = 600\\,\\mathrm{mg/100\\,g}$.\n\nFor practical counseling, the clinician also wants each serving to contribute at least $H = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ of combined DHA+EPA to be meaningfully supportive of neurodevelopment. Which option best justifies recommending salmon, sardines, and trout over tuna or swordfish for the infant’s $3$ weekly seafood servings?\n\nA. Salmon, sardines, and trout each deliver $\\ge H$ of DHA+EPA per $30\\,\\mathrm{g}$ serving while the summed weekly methylmercury exposure remains below $D_{\\text{week}} = d \\times 7 \\times W$; tuna and swordfish either fail the DHA+EPA threshold or lead to weekly methylmercury exceeding $D_{\\text{week}}$.\n\nB. Albacore tuna has omega-$3$ content comparable to salmon and negligible methylmercury; weekly limits are not relevant because the RfD applies per meal rather than per day, so $d$ does not need to be multiplied by $7$ or by $W$.\n\nC. Swordfish is acceptable because boiling reduces methylmercury to safe levels; swordfish’s omega-$3$ density per gram is superior to salmon, so it should be prioritized.\n\nD. Light tuna should be preferred because marketing claims “low mercury” and its DHA+EPA per serving can be augmented by the infant’s endogenous conversion of alpha-linolenic acid to DHA, making mercury considerations secondary to total omega-$3$ intake.",

Analysis of Multiple-Choice Options**\n-   **A:** Correctly states that salmon, sardines, and trout meet the DHA+EPA requirement while keeping weekly methylmercury exposure within the calculated limit. It also correctly notes that tuna and swordfish fail one or both criteria. This aligns perfectly with our analysis.\n-   **B:** Incorrect. Albacore tuna has high, not negligible, methylmercury. The RfD is a daily limit based on body weight, not a per-meal limit.\n-   **C:** Incorrect. It makes an unsubstantiated claim about boiling and falsely claims swordfish has superior omega-3 density to salmon.\n-   **D:** Incorrect. It relies on marketing claims over data, dismisses the importance of mercury safety, and overstates the contribution of ALA conversion. Light tuna fails both the DHA+EPA and the mercury criteria based on the data provided.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct justification.",
