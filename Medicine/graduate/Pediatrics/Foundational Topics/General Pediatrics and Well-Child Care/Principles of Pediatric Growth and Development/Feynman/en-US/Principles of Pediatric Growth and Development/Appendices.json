            "problem": "A male child aged $24$ months is being evaluated for weight-for-age using the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards and the Lambda-Mu-Sigma framework. In this framework, anthropometric measures are modeled so that, after an appropriate power transformation, the distribution is approximately Gaussian with a location parameter equal to the median and a scale parameter capturing dispersion. For the age-sex stratum corresponding to this child, a validated reference set provides the following parameters: $L=-0.300$, $M=12.2$ kilograms, and $S=0.090$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established biostatistical principles of the Lambda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) method used for constructing growth charts, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated objectively.\n\nThe LMS method is designed to normalize skewed anthropometric data, such as weight-for-age, to a standard normal distribution. This is achieved through a Box-Cox power transformation. For a given measurement $Y$ at a specific age, the method uses three parameters: $M$ (the median), $S$ (the coefficient of variation), and $L$ (the skewness parameter, which is the power of the Box-Cox transformation).\n\nThe relationship between a measurement $Y$ and its corresponding standard normal deviate, or $Z$-score, is defined by the centile equation. For a value of $L$ not equal to zero, this equation is:\n$$ Y = M (1 + L S Z)^{\\frac{1}{L}} $$\nHere, $Y$ is the child's measurement, and $Z$ is the $Z$-score we wish to determine. The parameters $L$, $M$, and $S$ are given for the child's specific age and sex.\n\nTo derive the expression for the $Z$-score, we must algebraically rearrange this equation to solve for $Z$. The derivation proceeds as follows:\n\nFirst, divide both sides by the median, $M$:\n$$ \\frac{Y}{M} = (1 + L S Z)^{\\frac{1}{L}} $$\nNext, to eliminate the fractional exponent, raise both sides to the power of $L$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L = \\left((1 + L S Z)^{\\frac{1}{L}}\\right)^L $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L = 1 + L S Z $$\nNow, isolate the term containing $Z$ by subtracting $1$ from both sides:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L - 1 = L S Z $$\nFinally, divide by the product $L S$ to solve for $Z$. This step is valid because the problem specifies the case where $L$ is nonzero ($L=-0.300$).\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L - 1}{L S} $$\nThis is the required expression for the weight-for-age $Z$-score when $L \\neq 0$.\n\nNow, we can compute the child's $Z$-score using the provided data:\n- Child's measured weight, $Y = 9.8$ kilograms.\n- Median weight for the age-sex stratum, $M = 12.2$ kilograms.\n- Skewness parameter, $L = -0.300$.\n- Coefficient of variation, $S = 0.090$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{9.8}{12.2}\\right)^{-0.300} - 1}{(-0.300)(0.090)} $$\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the child's weight to the median weight:\n$$ \\frac{Y}{M} = \\frac{9.8}{12.2} \\approx 0.8032786885 $$\nNext, apply the Box-Cox transformation by raising this ratio to the power of $L$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{Y}{M}\\right)^L \\approx (0.8032786885)^{-0.300} \\approx 1.06794025 $$\nNow, substitute this result into the numerator of the $Z$-score equation:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 1.06794025 - 1 = 0.06794025 $$\nThen, calculate the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = L S = (-0.300)(0.090) = -0.027 $$\nFinally, compute the $Z$-score by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$ Z = \\frac{0.06794025}{-0.027} \\approx -2.5163055... $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ Z \\approx -2.516 $$\nThis $Z$-score indicates that the child's weight is approximately $2.516$ standard deviations below the median weight for his age and sex, after accounting for the skewness of the reference distribution. This value falls between the standard thresholds of $Z=-2$ and $Z=-3$.",

The final program must operate purely on numerical inputs and produce a single-line output aggregating the results for all test cases.\n\nFoundational base to use:\n- Begin with the law of conservation of mass and energy applied to a growth-critical substrate.

            "solution": "The problem requires the development of a diagnostic algorithm for pediatric growth faltering based on the principle of conservation of energy. The solution is derived by first formalizing the physiological model and then creating a systematic method for prioritizing laboratory tests based on the model's output.\n\n### 1. Formalization of the Conservation Framework\n\nThe core of the algorithm rests on the law of conservation of mass and energy, applied to a growth-critical substrate (e.g., kilojoules of energy). We define the state of the system using the provided variables.\n\nLet $I$ be the daily intake per unit mass ($\\mathrm{kJ}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$), $A$ be the unitless absorption fraction, $L$ be the daily losses per unit mass ($\\mathrm{kJ}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$), $\\mu$ be the dimensionless utilization multiplier, and $R_b$ be the baseline physiological requirement per unit mass ($\\mathrm{kJ}/\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{day}$).\n\nFirst, we define the net available substrate for growth, $S_{\\text{net}}$, as the energy from intake that is successfully absorbed, less any subsequent losses.\n$$S_{\\text{net}} = I \\cdot A - L$$\n\nNext, we define the effective physiological requirement, $R_{\\text{eff}}$, which is the baseline requirement $R_b$ scaled by the utilization multiplier $\\mu$. A value of $\\mu > 1$ signifies an increased metabolic demand, for instance due to illness or a hypermetabolic state.\n$$R_{\\text{eff}} = R_b \\cdot \\mu$$\n\nA growth deficit, $D$, exists when the effective requirement exceeds the net available substrate. The magnitude of this deficit is given by:\n$$D = R_{\\text{eff}} - S_{\\text{net}}$$\nSubstituting the definitions for $S_{\\text{net}}$ and $R_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$D = (R_b \\cdot \\mu) - (I \\cdot A - L) = R_b \\mu - IA + L$$\nThe first step of the algorithm is to calculate $D$. If $D \\le 0$, no deficit exists, and the analysis for that case terminates, yielding an empty list of tests.\n\n### 2. Decomposition of the Deficit\n\nIf a deficit ($D > 0$) is found, the next step is to attribute this deficit to the four mechanistic domains: intake, absorption, losses, and utilization. This is achieved by decomposing the total deficit into contributions from each domain. The decomposition is performed by comparing the actual state to a defined reference state representing ideal physiological function.\n\nThe reference state is defined by:\n- Reference absorption fraction, $A^{\\text{ref}} = 0.95$\n- Reference losses, $L^{\\text{ref}} = 0$\n- Reference utilization multiplier, $\\mu^{\\text{ref}} = 1.0$\n\nThe total deficit equation, $D = R_b \\mu - IA + L$, can be decomposed by adding and subtracting terms corresponding to the reference state:\n$$D = (R_b - I A^{\\text{ref}}) + (I A^{\\text{ref}} - IA) + (L - L^{\\text{ref}}) + (R_b \\mu - R_b \\mu^{\\text{ref}})$$\nSince $L^{\\text{ref}}=0$ and $\\mu^{\\text{ref}}=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$D = \\underbrace{(R_b - I A^{\\text{ref}})}_{\\text{Intake Effect}} + \\underbrace{I (A^{\\text{ref}} - A)}_{\\text{Absorption Effect}} + \\underbrace{L}_{\\text{Losses Effect}} + \\underbrace{R_b (\\mu - 1)}_{\\text{Utilization Effect}}$$\nThis identity perfectly partitions the deficit into four terms, each corresponding to a deviation from the reference state for one domain.\n\nThe problem requires quantifying the **nonnegative contributions** of each domain to the deficit. An effect that would decrease the deficit (e.g., intake higher than the reference requirement, $I A^{\\text{ref}} > R_b$) is considered to have a zero contribution *to the deficit*. This leads to the following definitions for the contributions, denoted by $C$:\n\n1.  **Intake Contribution ($C_I$)**: This is the deficit that would exist if all other domains were ideal. It is positive only if the ideally absorbed intake ($I \\cdot A^{\\text{ref}}$) is insufficient to meet the baseline requirement ($R_b$).\n    $$C_I = \\max(0, R_b - I \\cdot A^{\\text{ref}})$$\n\n2.  **Absorption Contribution ($C_A$)**: This is the amount of substrate lost because the actual absorption fraction $A$ is lower than the reference $A^{\\text{ref}}$.\n    $$C_A = I \\cdot \\max(0, A^{\\text{ref}} - A)$$\n\n3.  **Losses Contribution ($C_L$)**: This is the direct contribution from losses, which are assumed to be non-negative. It measures the excess over the reference loss $L^{\\text{ref}}=0$.\n    $$C_L = \\max(0, L - L^{\\text{ref}}) = L$$\n\n4.  **Utilization Contribution ($C_U$)**: This is the increased demand due to the utilization multiplier $\\mu$ being greater than the baseline $\\mu^{\\text{ref}}=1$.\n    $$C_U = R_b \\cdot \\max(0, \\mu - 1)$$\n\n### 3. Prioritization Algorithm\n\nWith the contributions quantified, the final step is to rank the domains and generate the prioritized list of test codes.\n\n1.  **Calculate Contributions**: For a case with $D > 0$, calculate the four non-negative contributions $C_I, C_A, C_L, C_U$ as defined above.\n2.  **Filter and Structure**: Create a list of domains that have a contribution greater than zero ($C > 0$). Each item in the list will store the contribution value, a tie-breaking index, and the associated test codes. The fixed tie-breaking order is utilization, absorption, losses, intake. We assign integer indices to enforce this: Utilization ($0$), Absorption ($1$), Losses ($2$), Intake ($3$).\n3.  **Sort**: Sort this list of contributing domains. The primary sorting criterion is the contribution magnitude in descending order. The secondary sorting criterion is the tie-breaking index in ascending order.\n4.  **Select and Concatenate**: Select the top two domains from the sorted list. If there is only one contributing domain, select only that one. Concatenate the test codes of the selected domains in their ranked order to produce the final result for the case.\n\nThe test codes are mapped as follows:\n- Intake: $[11, 12]$\n- Losses: $[21, 22]$\n- Absorption: $[31, 32]$\n- Utilization: $[41, 42]$\n\nThis systematic procedure, grounded in a conservation principle and a clear decomposition logic, produces a robust and reproducible prioritization of diagnostic tests.",
