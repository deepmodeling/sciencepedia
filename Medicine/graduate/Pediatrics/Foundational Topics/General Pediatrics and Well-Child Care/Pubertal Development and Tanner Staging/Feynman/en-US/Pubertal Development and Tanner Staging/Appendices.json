            "problem": "A $14.2$-year-old boy is referred for suspected delayed puberty.

Over the past $12$ months, his recorded growth velocity was $3.2\\,\\mathrm{cm/year}$. His father’s height is $178\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and his mother’s height is $165\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. There is no chronic illness, normal diet, and no psychosocial stressors.

Primary (hypergonadotropic) hypogonadism presents with elevated LH/FSH and low testosterone, while secondary (hypogonadotropic) hypogonadism presents with low/normal LH/FSH and low testosterone.\n- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and pituitary is indicated when clinical or biochemical data suggest central pathology (e.g., hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with neurological or visual symptoms) and should be targeted rather than performed indiscriminately.\n- Gonadal imaging (e.g., scrotal ultrasound) is indicated when there are testicular asymmetry, masses, or nonpalpable gonads, not as routine first-line evaluation.\n- In ambiguous cases with low/normal basal gonadotropins, a GnRH (or GnRH-agonist) stimulation test can help distinguish constitutional delay (typically a pubertal LH response) from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (blunted LH response).\n\nWhich option best describes a scientifically sound, stepwise algorithm for this patient?\n\nA. Begin with targeted pituitary Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to rule out central nervous system lesions, followed by measurement of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH), and testosterone, then obtain bone age and finally consider growth data and midparental target height to contextualize findings.\n\nB. Confirm delayed puberty by Tanner staging and testicular volume, then collect growth data (including height $z$-score and growth velocity), compute midparental target height as $$\\frac{178\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 165\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 13\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{2},$$ obtain a left-hand bone age radiograph, measure morning basal LH, FSH, and testosterone, and classify as hypergonadotropic versus hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. If LH/FSH are low/normal with low testosterone, consider a GnRH-stimulation test to differentiate constitutional delay from hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; proceed to brain MRI only if biochemical hypogonadotropic pattern is supported by clinical red flags. If LH/FSH are elevated with low testosterone, evaluate for primary testicular failure (including karyotype when indicated) and reserve scrotal ultrasound for asymmetric or nonpalpable testes.\n\nC. Measure testosterone first; if low, initiate a trial of low-dose testosterone therapy to “jump-start” puberty, then obtain bone age and growth data if clinical response is inadequate, and finally perform comprehensive imaging (brain MRI and scrotal ultrasound) if puberty does not progress after $6$ months.\n\nD. Obtain bone age radiograph; if bone age is delayed by more than $2$ years relative to chronological age, diagnose constitutional delay of growth and puberty and avoid gonadotropin or sex steroid assessment and imaging.\n\nE. Start with growth data and bone age; then measure LH, FSH, and testosterone; perform scrotal ultrasound in all boys with delayed puberty regardless of gonadal examination or biochemical pattern; reserve brain MRI for cases with elevated LH and FSH.\n\nSelect the single best option.",
            "solution": "The evaluation must be derived from first principles of pubertal physiology and growth, prioritizing noninvasive, high-yield information before targeted testing and imaging.\n\nFirst, establish the definition of delayed puberty. In boys, testicular enlargement to at least $4\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ marks pubertal onset; absence by age $14$ years indicates delayed puberty. This patient is $14.2$ years old with testicular volume $3\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, satisfying the definition.\n\nSecond, growth fundamentals. Normal early adolescent growth velocity is approximately $5$–$7\\,\\mathrm{cm/year}$. This patient’s velocity is $3.2\\,\\mathrm{cm/year}$, suggesting impaired growth and/or delayed maturation. Midparental target height for boys is computed as \n$$\\text{Target height} = \\frac{H_{\\text{father}} + H_{\\text{mother}} + 13\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{2} = \\frac{178\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 165\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 13\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{2} = \\frac{356\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{2} = 178\\,\\mathrm{cm}.$$\nThis frames expected adult height. A low current height ($153\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) at $14.2$ years with low velocity suggests delayed maturation rather than fixed short stature, but we need skeletal maturity to contextualize.\n\nThird, bone age. Bone age reflects skeletal maturation governed by sex steroids and growth hormone–Insulin-Like Growth Factor $1$ axis and is delayed in constitutional delay of growth and puberty. A bone age delayed relative to chronological age supports constitutional delay; a normal bone age with delayed puberty raises concern for hypogonadism. Therefore, bone age should precede endocrine classification to interpret growth data correctly.\n\nFourth, classify endocrine status using the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates LH and FSH; LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone; FSH supports Sertoli cells and spermatogenesis. Patterns:\n- Primary testicular failure (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism): elevated LH/FSH with low testosterone due to impaired gonadal production.\n- Central hypogonadism (hypogonadotropic): low/normal LH/FSH with low testosterone due to hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction.\nIn early puberty, basal LH/FSH can be low even in constitutional delay; a GnRH stimulation test can be used when basal values are indeterminate—constitutional delay typically shows a pubertal LH response (e.g., LH peak exceeding approximately $5$–$8\\,\\mathrm{IU/L}$ depending on assay), whereas hypogonadotropic hypogonadism shows a blunted response.\n\nFifth, targeted imaging. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is warranted when biochemical hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is suspected and supported by clinical red flags (visual field deficits, headaches, galactorrhea suggesting hyperprolactinemia, anosmia suggesting Kallmann syndrome, neurological signs). indiscriminate imaging is low-yield and not stepwise. Scrotal ultrasound is appropriate for asymmetric, nonpalpable, or suspicious testes, not routinely in all cases. Karyotype and further gonadal evaluation are indicated in hypergonadotropic patterns to identify primary gonadal disorders.\n\nPutting these together, the correct algorithm should:\n1. Confirm delayed puberty by Tanner staging and testicular volume.\n2. Collect growth data, compute midparental target height, and quantify growth velocity.\n3. Obtain bone age to frame skeletal maturation.\n4. Measure morning basal LH, FSH, and testosterone to classify hypo- versus hypergonadotropic hypogonadism; consider GnRH stimulation when basal studies are indeterminate to differentiate constitutional delay from central hypogonadism.\n5. Apply targeted imaging based on classification and clinical red flags: brain MRI for hypogonadotropic concerns with red flags; scrotal ultrasound only if testicular exam suggests pathology; consider karyotype if hypergonadotropic.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: This proposes starting with pituitary MRI before basic, high-yield clinical and biochemical assessment. That violates stepwise, rational ordering because brain MRI is low-yield in a boy with no neurological or visual symptoms and should be targeted after biochemical classification. It defers growth data and bone age until late, which is not ideal for contextualizing endocrine findings. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option B: This sequence aligns with first principles: confirm delayed puberty, integrate growth data and midparental target height, obtain bone age early to interpret growth delay, measure basal LH/FSH/testosterone to classify hypo- versus hypergonadotropic patterns, use GnRH stimulation when basal results are indeterminate, and proceed to targeted imaging only when indicated by biochemical pattern and clinical red flags. It reserves scrotal ultrasound for specific gonadal findings and considers karyotype in hypergonadotropic cases. Verdict: Correct.\n- Option C: This begins with testosterone only and introduces empiric therapy before diagnostic classification, potentially obscuring the diagnosis and contravening a principled evaluation. It delays bone age and growth contextualization and uses imaging only after therapeutic trials, which is not a diagnostic algorithm but a treatment-first approach. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option D: This relies solely on bone age to diagnose constitutional delay and explicitly avoids endocrine and imaging assessment. While delayed bone age is supportive, bone age alone cannot exclude central or primary hypogonadism, and the low growth velocity mandates endocrine assessment. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- Option E: This begins appropriately with growth data and bone age but mandates scrotal ultrasound in all boys, which is not targeted and is low-yield when testes are palpable and symmetric. It also reserves brain MRI for elevated LH/FSH (hypergonadotropic), which is illogical; MRI evaluates central causes and is indicated in hypogonadotropic cases with appropriate clinical context. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is Option B.",
