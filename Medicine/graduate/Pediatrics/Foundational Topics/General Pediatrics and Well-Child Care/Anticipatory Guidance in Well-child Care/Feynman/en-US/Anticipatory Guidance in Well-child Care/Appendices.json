            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Subject: A boy child.\n- Age: $18$ months.\n- Measured weight ($x$): $14\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Reference population: Boys at $18$ months, World Health Organization (WHO) growth reference.\n- Statistical model for weight-for-age: Normal distribution.\n- Mean of the reference distribution ($\\mu$): $12\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Standard deviation of the reference distribution ($\\sigma$): $1.5\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Required tasks:\n    1. Derive the expression for the weight $z$-score.\n    2. Compute its value for the specified child.\n    3. Interpret its clinical significance for anticipatory guidance.\n- Rounding requirement: The final $z$-score must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in established principles of biostatistics and clinical pediatrics. The use of a normal distribution to model weight-for-age and the application of $z$-scores for growth monitoring are standard practices endorsed by the WHO. The given values for mean and standard deviation are physiologically plausible for the specified age and sex.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and the individual measurement $x$) to calculate the $z$-score. The instructions are clear and lead to a unique, meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective language without subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the $z$-score, its computation, and its clinical interpretation.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the $z$-score\nLet $X$ be a random variable representing the weight-for-age of boys at $18$ months. According to the problem statement, $X$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$. This is denoted as $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nThe goal is to find a linear transformation that maps the random variable $X$ to a standard normal random variable $Z$, which has a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$, denoted as $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1^2)$. Let this transformation be of the form:\n$$Z = aX + b$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are constants to be determined.\n\nWe use the properties of expected value and variance. The expected value of $Z$ is:\n$$E[Z] = E[aX + b]$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$E[Z] = aE[X] + b$$\nGiven $E[X] = \\mu$ and the requirement that $E[Z] = 0$, we have:\n$$0 = a\\mu + b$$\nwhich implies:\n$$b = -a\\mu$$\n\nNext, we consider the variance of $Z$. The variance of a transformed random variable $aX+b$ is given by:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(Z) = \\mathrm{Var}(aX + b) = a^2\\mathrm{Var}(X)$$\nGiven $\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\sigma^2$ and the requirement that $\\mathrm{Var}(Z) = 1^2 = 1$, we have:\n$$1 = a^2\\sigma^2$$\nSolving for $a$, and taking the positive root by convention, we get:\n$$a = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $a$ back into the equation for $b$:\n$$b = -a\\mu = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\mu = -\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n\nSubstituting the determined values of $a$ and $b$ back into the transformation equation $Z = aX + b$, we obtain the expression for the $z$-score:\n$$Z = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}X - \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nFor a specific measured value, which we denote as $x$, the corresponding $z$-score is calculated as:\n$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nThis is the fundamental expression for the $z$-score.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of the Child's $z$-score\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- The child's measured weight, $x = 14\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- The mean weight for the reference population, $\\mu = 12\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- The standard deviation of weight for the reference population, $\\sigma = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$z = \\frac{14 - 12}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{1.5}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can write $1.5$ as $\\frac{3}{2}$:\n$$z = \\frac{2}{\\frac{3}{2}} = 2 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $1.3333...$. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$z \\approx 1.333$$\n\n### Part 3: Clinical Interpretation for Anticipatory Guidance\nA $z$-score quantifies how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean of its reference population. A positive value indicates the observation is above the mean, while a negative value indicates it is below the mean.\n\nThe calculated $z$-score for this child's weight is $+1.333$. This means the child's weight of $14\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ is $1.333$ standard deviations above the average weight for boys of his age in the WHO reference population.\n\nIn the context of WHO growth standards, $z$-scores are interpreted as follows:\n- A $z$-score between $-2$ and $+2$ is considered within the range of normal growth.\n- A weight-for-age $z$-score greater than $+2$ may indicate a risk of becoming overweight, and a score greater than $+3$ indicates obesity.\n- A score between $-2$ and $-3$ indicates underweight, and a score below $-3$ indicates severe underweight.\n\nSince the child's $z$-score of $+1.333$ falls within the normal range (i.e., $-2 < 1.333 < +2$), the child is not classified as overweight. However, the weight is on the upper side of the normal distribution.\n\nFor anticipatory guidance in well-child care, this finding is significant. It does not warrant an immediate diagnosis of a weight problem but serves as a crucial data point for monitoring the child's growth trajectory. A pediatrician would note this trend and provide proactive counsel to the parents on topics such as:\n1.  Maintaining a balanced diet appropriate for a toddler.\n2.  Promoting active play and limiting sedentary time.\n3.  Ensuring future weight gain is proportional to height gain.\n\nThe goal of this guidance is to prevent the child from crossing into the overweight or obese categories in the future, thus embodying the \"anticipatory\" nature of the clinical visit. The $z$-score provides an objective, standardized measure to inform this clinical judgment and counseling.",

            "introduction": "Vaccination counseling is a key component of anticipatory guidance, protecting both the individual child and the community. This exercise delves into the population-level science behind vaccination by deriving the herd immunity threshold from the basic reproduction number, $R_0$. By working through this fundamental epidemiological model, you will gain a deeper understanding of how individual vaccinations contribute to halting the spread of infectious diseases like measles, strengthening your ability to provide compelling, evidence-based counsel. ",

            "problem": "A pediatrician delivering anticipatory guidance during a well-child visit seeks to explain how community immunity against measles is achieved through vaccination. Consider transmission modeled by the Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered (SIR) framework with homogeneous mixing. The basic reproduction number $R_0$ is defined as the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individual introduced into a fully susceptible population, and the effective reproduction number $R_e$ is the expected number of secondary infections when only a fraction of the population is susceptible. Assume that immunity (from vaccination or prior infection) is distributed uniformly at random in the population and that immunity reduces susceptibility to zero.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions in the SIR framework (including the interpretation of $R_0$ and the relationship between transmission and susceptibility), derive a general expression for the critical immunity proportion $p_c$ required to achieve herd immunity, defined as the smallest immunity fraction such that transmission cannot be sustained, and then evaluate this expression for measles with $R_0 \\approx 12$. Express the final immunity proportion as a decimal, and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of mathematical epidemiology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the critical immunity proportion, $p_c$, required to achieve herd immunity for a disease characterized by a basic reproduction number, $R_0$. Herd immunity is defined as the state where transmission cannot be sustained within the population.\n\nLet $s$ be the fraction of the population that is susceptible to the infection. By definition, the value of $s$ ranges from $s=0$ (no one is susceptible) to $s=1$ (the entire population is susceptible).\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, represents the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population (i.e., when $s=1$).\n\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a population where only a fraction $s$ is susceptible. Assuming homogeneous mixing, an infectious individual's contacts are with susceptible individuals with probability $s$. Therefore, the number of successful secondary transmissions is reduced by a factor of $s$ compared to a fully susceptible population. This establishes the fundamental relationship between $R_e$ and $R_0$:\n$$R_e = s \\cdot R_0$$\n\nAn epidemic will grow if, on average, each infected person infects more than one other person, i.e., if $R_e > 1$. Conversely, the epidemic will decline and eventually be eliminated if each infected person infects fewer than one other person on average, i.e., if $R_e < 1$. The critical threshold for sustained transmission is the point at which the number of new infections is exactly balanced, which corresponds to an effective reproduction number of unity.\n$$R_e = 1$$\nThis is the condition for achieving herd immunity. At or below this threshold, the disease cannot propagate through the population.\n\nTo find the critical proportion of the population that must be immune, we first determine the critical fraction of the population that can remain susceptible, denoted as $s_c$, for herd immunity to be established. We set $R_e = 1$ in our primary equation:\n$$1 = s_c \\cdot R_0$$\nSolving for the critical susceptible fraction $s_c$ gives:\n$$s_c = \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nThis expression represents the maximum permissible fraction of susceptible individuals in the population for transmission to be halted.\n\nThe question asks for the critical immunity proportion, $p_c$. Assuming that individuals in the population are either susceptible or immune, the sum of these proportions must be $1$. Let $p$ be the proportion of the population that is immune. Then:\n$$s + p = 1$$\nThe critical immunity proportion, $p_c$, is the minimum fraction of the population that must be immune to keep the susceptible fraction at or below its critical value, $s_c$. This occurs when the susceptible fraction is exactly $s_c$. Thus:\n$$s_c + p_c = 1$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s_c$ we derived:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_0} + p_c = 1$$\nSolving for $p_c$, we obtain the general expression for the critical immunity proportion:\n$$p_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\nThis is the required general expression.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for measles, for which the problem provides $R_0 \\approx 12$. Substituting this value into our derived formula:\n$$p_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{12}$$\nTo compute the numerical value:\n$$p_c = \\frac{12}{12} - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{11}{12}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$p_c = 0.91666...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant digits are $9$, $1$, $6$, and $6$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$p_c \\approx 0.9167$$\nThis result indicates that approximately $91.67\\%$ of the population must be immune to measles to prevent sustained transmission.",
