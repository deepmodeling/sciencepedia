            "problem": "A $7$-year-old child presents for routine growth assessment. Using first principles—core definitions and dimensional consistency in the International System of Units (SI)—establish the functional form of Body Mass Index (BMI) in coherent SI units, where body mass is measured in kilograms and stature (standing height) is measured in meters. Then, for a child with body mass $24.0$ kilograms and standing height $123.4$ centimeters, compute the BMI using the SI expression you derived. Convert stature to meters before calculation. Express the final BMI in kilograms per square meter and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part response: first, to establish the functional form of the Body Mass Index (BMI) from first principles using dimensional analysis in SI units, and second, to calculate the BMI for a child with given mass and stature.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the BMI Functional Form\n\nThe Body Mass Index is an indicator designed to quantify body mass relative to body size. Let body mass be represented by the variable $m$ and stature (height) by the variable $h$. The problem specifies the use of coherent SI units, so mass $m$ is measured in kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) and height $h$ is measured in meters ($\\mathrm{m}$).\n\nIn dimensional analysis, we use the fundamental dimensions of mass, denoted $[M]$, and length, denoted $[L]$.\nThe dimension of mass $m$ is $[M]$.\nThe dimension of height $h$ is $[L]$.\n\nThe problem states that the resulting BMI should be expressed in units of kilograms per square meter ($\\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m}^2}$). This explicitly defines the dimensions of BMI. Let's denote BMI by the symbol $B$. The dimensions of $B$ are:\n$$[B] = \\frac{[M]}{[L]^2} = [M][L]^{-2}$$\n\nWe hypothesize that BMI is a function of mass and height, expressible as a power-law relationship, which is common for physical indices:\n$$B = k \\cdot m^a \\cdot h^b$$\nwhere $k$ is a dimensionless constant of proportionality, and $a$ and $b$ are exponents to be determined.\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, the dimensions on both sides of the equation must be equal. The dimensions of the right side of the equation are:\n$$[k \\cdot m^a \\cdot h^b] = [k] \\cdot [m]^a \\cdot [h]^b = (1) \\cdot [M]^a \\cdot [L]^b = [M]^a [L]^b$$\nHere, $[k]=1$ because it is a dimensionless constant.\n\nEquating the dimensions of both sides:\n$$[M]^1 [L]^{-2} = [M]^a [L]^b$$\n\nFor this equality to hold, the exponents of each fundamental dimension must be identical.\nComparing the exponents for mass $[M]$:\n$$1 = a$$\nComparing the exponents for length $[L]$:\n$$-2 = b$$\n\nSubstituting these exponents back into the hypothesized relationship gives the functional form:\n$$B = k \\cdot m^1 \\cdot h^{-2} = k \\frac{m}{h^2}$$\nIn the standard SI-based definition of BMI, the constant of proportionality $k$ is set to $1$ for simplicity and direct interpretation. Therefore, the functional form of BMI is established as:\n$$B = \\frac{m}{h^2}$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of BMI\n\nThe problem provides the following data for a $7$-year-old child:\nBody mass, $m = 24.0 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\nStature, $h_{\\text{initial}} = 123.4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nFirst, we must convert the stature from centimeters to the coherent SI unit of meters, as required by the derived formula.\nSince $1 \\ \\mathrm{m} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$, the conversion is:\n$$h = 123.4 \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{m}}{100 \\ \\mathrm{cm}} = 1.234 \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNext, we substitute the values of $m$ and $h$ into the BMI formula:\n$$B = \\frac{m}{h^2} = \\frac{24.0}{(1.234)^2}$$\n\nWe calculate the square of the height:\n$$h^2 = (1.234)^2 = 1.522756 \\ \\mathrm{m}^2$$\n\nNow, we compute the BMI value:\n$$B = \\frac{24.0 \\ \\mathrm{kg}}{1.522756 \\ \\mathrm{m}^2} \\approx 15.761105... \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m}^2}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The input value for mass, $24.0 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$, has three significant figures. The input value for height, $123.4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$, has four significant figures. In a calculation involving division, the result should be reported with the least number of significant figures from the input measurements, which is three.\n\nRounding $15.761105...$ to three significant figures gives $15.8$.\nThe final calculated BMI is $15.8 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m}^2}$.",

            "problem": "A neonate is weighed on an electronic pediatric scale during a routine growth assessment. The displayed weight is $4.2$ kilograms while the infant is wearing a dry disposable diaper with mass $150$ grams. The scale has a documented positive calibration drift of $50$ grams relative to a certified reference standard, such that the scale reading is elevated by an additive offset. Recumbent length is measured as $54.0$ centimeters using a calibrated length board, and head circumference is measured as $37.5$ centimeters using a non-stretchable tape.\n\nStarting from core measurement principles that the observed mass on a scale is the true mass plus any additive biases (such as clothing or calibration offsets), and using the standard definition of Body Mass Index (BMI), derive the corrected naked weight and the corrected Body Mass Index (BMI) for this infant. Then, briefly state the correction terms you would apply prospectively to eliminate these biases from future measurements.\n\nCompute and report only the corrected Body Mass Index (BMI). Express the final answer in kilograms per square meter ($\\text{kg/m}^2$) and round your numerical result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The fundamental measurement principle for mass is that a scale reports an observed value that can be modeled as the sum of the true mass and additive biases. Let $W_{\\text{true}}$ denote the infant’s true naked weight, $W_{\\text{obs}}$ the observed scale reading, $m_{d}$ the diaper mass, and $\\Delta$ the calibration drift (a positive offset means the scale reads high).

            "introduction": "A raw measurement, even when corrected for bias, has limited meaning without context. To interpret a child's growth, we must compare their metrics to age- and sex-specific reference data.

For this child, the BMI measurement is $x = 19.2 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}$. The corresponding age- and sex-specific parameters from the World Health Organization (WHO) BMI-for-age reference are provided as follows: $L = -2$, $M = 16.5$, and $S = 0.10$. Using the parameterization that models age-specific distributions of anthropometric measures via a Box–Cox power transformation with median $M$, generalized coefficient of variation $S$, and power $L$, compute the standardized BMI $z$-score for this child. Then, based on the meaning of a $z$-score in a normally distributed, standardized frame, provide a brief interpretation of the value in terms of how many standard deviations the BMI is from the age- and sex-specific median and in which direction. Round your numerical $z$-score to four significant figures and report it as a pure number without units.",
            "solution": "The LMS method transforms anthropometric data to a standard normal distribution to allow for comparisons across different ages and sexes. The transformation is a specific form of a Box–Cox power transformation. The $z$-score, which represents the number of standard deviations from the median in this normalized distribution, is calculated using the measurement $x$ and the age- and sex-specific parameters $L$ (the power in the Box-Cox transformation, related to skewness), $M$ (the median), and $S$ (the generalized coefficient of variation).\n\nThe formula for the $z$-score is given by:\n$$z = \\frac{\\left[ \\left( \\frac{x}{M} \\right)^L - 1 \\right]}{L S} \\quad \\text{for } L \\neq 0$$\nIf $L = 0$, the formula simplifies to:\n$$z = \\frac{\\ln\\left( \\frac{x}{M} \\right)}{S}$$\nIn this problem, the given parameters are:\n- The measured BMI, $x = 19.2 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}$\n- The power parameter, $L = -2$\n- The median parameter, $M = 16.5 \\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-2}}$\n- The generalized coefficient of variation, $S = 0.10$\n\nSince $L = -2$, which is not equal to $0$, we use the first formula. We substitute the given values into the equation:\n$$z = \\frac{\\left[ \\left( \\frac{19.2}{16.5} \\right)^{-2} - 1 \\right]}{(-2)(0.10)}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the ratio of the measured BMI to the median BMI:\n$$\\frac{x}{M} = \\frac{19.2}{16.5} \\approx 1.163636...$$\nNext, we raise this ratio to the power of $L$:\n$$\\left( \\frac{19.2}{16.5} \\right)^{-2} \\approx (1.163636...)^{-2} \\approx 0.73853125$$\nNow, we subtract $1$ from this value:\n$$\\left( \\frac{19.2}{16.5} \\right)^{-2} - 1 \\approx 0.73853125 - 1 = -0.26146875$$\nThen, we calculate the denominator, $L \\times S$:\n$$L S = (-2)(0.10) = -0.2$$\nFinally, we divide the numerator by the denominator to find the $z$-score:\n$$z = \\frac{-0.26146875}{-0.2} = 1.30734375$$\nThe problem requires the numerical $z$-score to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$z \\approx 1.307$$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a brief interpretation of this value. A $z$-score quantifies the deviation of a data point from the central tendency (in this case, the median $M$) of its reference population, expressed in units of standard deviations of the standardized distribution.\n- A positive $z$-score indicates that the measurement is above the median.\n- A negative $z$-score indicates that the measurement is below the median.\n- The magnitude of the $z$-score indicates the extent of the deviation.\nTherefore, a $z$-score of approximately $1.307$ means that the child's BMI is $1.307$ standard deviations above the median BMI for their specific age and sex group. This places the child's BMI above the average for their peers but typically within the range considered healthy (usually defined as between $z = -2$ and $z = +1$ or $+2$, depending on the specific guideline).",
