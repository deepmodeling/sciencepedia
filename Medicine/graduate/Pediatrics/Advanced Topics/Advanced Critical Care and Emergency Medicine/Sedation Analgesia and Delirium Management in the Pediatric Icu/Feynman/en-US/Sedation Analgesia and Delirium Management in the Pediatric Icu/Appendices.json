            "problem": "A child in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) requires continuous analgesia as part of a sedation-analgesia protocol. The child weighs $12$ kg on a calibrated bed scale. The plan is to initiate a continuous intravenous morphine infusion at a weight-based rate of $20$ micrograms per kilogram per hour (mcg/kg/h). Using fundamental definitions of mass-based dosing and dimensional unit conversion, determine the initial absolute infusion rate in milligrams per hour (mg/h) suitable for pump programming. Round your answer to three significant figures and express the final rate in mg/h.",
            "solution": "Begin from the core definitions relevant to mass-based dosing and unit conversion.\n\n1. Fundamental definition of weight-based dose rate: if a medication is prescribed at a rate of $r$ micrograms per kilogram per hour (mcg/kg/h) and the patient’s mass is $m$ kilograms (kg), the absolute dose rate $D$ in micrograms per hour (mcg/h) is given by\n$$\nD = r \\times m.\n$$\n\n2. Unit conversion between micrograms and milligrams is defined by\n$$\n1 \\text{ mg} = 1000 \\text{ mcg}.\n$$\nTherefore, to convert a dose rate from mcg/h to mg/h, divide by $1000$.\n\nApply these steps to the given values. The prescribed rate is $r = 20$ mcg/kg/h and the mass is $m = 12$ kg.\n\nCompute the absolute dose rate in micrograms per hour:\n$$\nD_{\\text{mcg/h}} = 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\text{ mcg/h}.\n$$\n\nConvert this to milligrams per hour:\n$$\nD_{\\text{mg/h}} = \\frac{240}{1000} = 0.24 \\text{ mg/h}.\n$$\n\nApply the specified rounding to three significant figures. The value $0.24$ mg/h has two significant figures; expressing it to three significant figures yields $0.240$ mg/h.\n\nThus, the initial continuous infusion rate for morphine appropriate for pump programming is $0.240$ mg/h.",

The child’s body weight is $18.5 \\,\\mathrm{kg}$. To transition off intravenous fentanyl while minimizing iatrogenic withdrawal and delirium, the team plans to convert to enteral methadone and implement a gradual taper.\n\nUse the following widely accepted equianalgesic and pharmacologic facts as the fundamental base for your derivation:\n- Equianalgesia between intravenous fentanyl and intravenous morphine: $100 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ intravenous fentanyl produces analgesia comparable to $10 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$ intravenous morphine.\n- Intravenous-to-oral morphine conversion factor reflecting oral bioavailability and first-pass metabolism: oral morphine dose is $3$ times the intravenous morphine dose to achieve comparable analgesia.\n- Dose-dependent oral methadone potency relative to oral morphine: when the total daily oral morphine equivalent exceeds $500 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $1 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$ oral methadone is assumed equianalgesic to $20 \\,\\mathrm{mg}$ oral morphine.\n- Incomplete cross-tolerance when switching opioids: reduce the calculated equianalgesic oral methadone daily dose by 30% (that is, administer 70% of the equianalgesic amount) to enhance safety.\n- Dosing interval for enteral methadone: administer every $6 \\,\\mathrm{h}$ in evenly divided doses over the day.\n\nStarting from these facts and first principles of equianalgesic dosing, derive the child’s initial enteral methadone dose per administration (that is, the dose given every $6 \\,\\mathrm{h}$), expressed in $\\mathrm{mg}$.

            "solution": "The solution is determined in two parts as requested: the calculation of the initial methadone dose per administration and the symbolic outline of the tapering schedule.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Initial Enteral Methadone Dose**\n\nThe calculation is a multi-step process based on the provided equianalgesic conversions.\n\n**Step A: Calculate the total daily dose of intravenous fentanyl.**\nThe total daily dose of fentanyl ($D_{Fentanyl, TDD}$) is the rate multiplied by the patient's weight and the number of hours in a day.\n$$D_{Fentanyl, TDD} = (8\\,\\mu\\text{g}\\cdot\\text{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{h}^{-1}) \\times (18.5\\,\\text{kg}) \\times (24\\,\\text{h}) = 3552\\,\\mu\\text{g}$$\n\n**Step B: Convert the total daily fentanyl dose to its intravenous morphine equivalent (IVME).**\nUsing the ratio $100\\,\\mu\\text{g}$ IV Fentanyl = $10\\,\\text{mg}$ IV Morphine, the total daily IVME ($D_{M_{IV}, TDE}$) is:\n$$D_{M_{IV}, TDE} = 3552\\,\\mu\\text{g} \\times \\frac{10\\,\\text{mg}}{100\\,\\mu\\text{g}} = 355.2\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\n**Step C: Convert the total daily IVME to its oral morphine equivalent (OME).**\nThe oral morphine dose is $3$ times the IV dose.

The initial dose on Day 1 is $D_1 = D_{Meth, TDD, initial} = 37.296\\,\\text{mg}$.\nThe daily dose is reduced by 10% (a multiplicative factor of 0.1) of the previous day's dose. This means each day's dose is 90% of the prior day's dose.\n$$D_{n} = D_{n-1} - (0.1 \\times D_{n-1}) = 0.9 \\times D_{n-1} \\quad \\text{for } n > 1$$\n\n**Step B: Formulate the general expressions for the taper.**\nThe total daily dose on day $n$, $D_n$, can be expressed as a function of the initial dose $D_1$:\n$$D_n = D_1 \\times (0.9)^{n-1}$$\nThe dose per administration on day $n$, $d_n$, given every 6 hours (4 doses per day), is:\n$$d_n = \\frac{D_n}{4} = \\frac{D_1 \\times (0.9)^{n-1}}{4}$$\nThis symbolic framework defines the seven-day taper schedule.
