            "introduction": "Ethical decision-making often begins with a fundamental question: what is the potential for benefit? This first practice provides a tool for answering that question in a structured way by quantifying the expected benefit of a specific intervention, in this case, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) . By breaking down the outcome into a probabilistic chain of events—from achieving Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) to survival with a certain quality of life—this exercise demonstrates how basic probability theory can ground discussions of beneficence in transparent, data-informed estimates.",

            "problem": "In a pediatric intensive care unit, a multidisciplinary team is deliberating code status for a critically ill infant with multisystem organ failure. To support ethically justifiable recommendations, the team commits to a transparent, quantitative estimate of the expected benefit from Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). They adopt the following modeling assumptions grounded in core probability theory and health outcomes assessment.\n\nDefine events: $R$ for Return Of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) during CPR, and $S$ for survival to hospital discharge. In this setting, survival to discharge requires ROSC. Let $Q \\in [0,1]$ denote a constant neurological outcome quality weight approximating expected Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) at discharge, where $Q=1$ represents age-normative function and $Q=0$ represents death-equivalent outcome. The team specifies $p_{\\text{ROSC}}=\\mathbb{P}(R)=0.40$, $p_{\\text{survival}|\\text{ROSC}}=\\mathbb{P}(S\\,|\\,R)=0.20$, and $Q=0.50$ based on unit data and family-informed estimates of acceptable neurological outcomes.\n\nStarting only from the basic axioms of probability, the definition of conditional probability, and the definition of expected value for a Bernoulli outcome scaled by a constant quality weight, derive an expression for the expected quality-adjusted survival probability in terms of $p_{\\text{ROSC}}$, $p_{\\text{survival}|\\text{ROSC}}$, and $Q$. Then evaluate this expression using the provided values.\n\nRound your final numerical answer to two significant figures and express it as a decimal without a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the \"expected quality-adjusted survival probability\" and its subsequent evaluation. First, we must formalize this quantity. Let $S$ be the event of survival to hospital discharge. The outcome for the patient is considered in a binary fashion: survival or non-survival. However, the value of survival is weighted by a quality-of-life factor, $Q$. We can define a random variable, let's call it $X$, representing the quality-adjusted outcome. This variable takes the value $Q$ if the patient survives (event $S$ occurs) and $0$ if the patient does not survive (event $S^c$ occurs). The value of $0$ corresponds to a \"death-equivalent outcome\", as stated in the problem.\n\nThe expected value of this outcome, $E[X]$, is defined as the sum of each possible outcome value multiplied by its probability.\n$$E[X] = Q \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(S) + 0 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(S^c)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$E[X] = Q \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(S)$$\nThis quantity, $E[X]$, is what the problem refers to as the \"expected quality-adjusted survival probability\". Our task is to find an expression for $E[X]$ in terms of the given parameters and then calculate its value. This requires us to first find an expression for $\\mathbb{P}(S)$, the probability of survival to discharge.\n\nWe are given the following events and probabilities:\n- $R$: The event of Return Of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC).\n- $S$: The event of survival to hospital discharge.\n- $p_{\\text{ROSC}} = \\mathbb{P}(R) = 0.40$.\n- $p_{\\text{survival}|\\text{ROSC}} = \\mathbb{P}(S\\,|\\,R) = 0.20$.\n\nA critical piece of information is the statement that \"survival to discharge requires ROSC\". In the language of probability and set theory, this means that the event $S$ can only occur if the event $R$ has occurred. This implies that the event $S$ is a subset of the event $R$, denoted as $S \\subseteq R$. A direct consequence of this relationship is that the intersection of events $S$ and $R$ is the event $S$ itself, i.e., $S \\cap R = S$. Consequently, their probabilities are equal: $\\mathbb{P}(S \\cap R) = \\mathbb{P}(S)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the derivation must start from the basic axioms of probability and the definition of conditional probability. The definition of the conditional probability of event $S$ given event $R$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(S\\,|\\,R) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(S \\cap R)}{\\mathbb{P}(R)}$$\nThis definition is valid assuming $\\mathbb{P}(R) > 0$, which is true in this problem since $\\mathbb{P}(R) = 0.40$.\n\nUsing our finding that $\\mathbb{P}(S \\cap R) = \\mathbb{P}(S)$, we substitute this into the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(S\\,|\\,R) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(S)}{\\mathbb{P}(R)}$$\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for the unconditional probability of survival, $\\mathbb{P}(S)$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(S) = \\mathbb{P}(S\\,|\\,R) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(R)$$\nThis is a standard result known as the multiplication rule of probability, derived here from first principles as requested.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the expected quality-adjusted survival probability, $E[X]$, using the given symbolic names:\n$$E[X] = Q \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(S) = Q \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(S\\,|\\,R) \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(R)$$\nSubstituting the problem's notation ($p_{\\text{ROSC}}$ and $p_{\\text{survival}|\\text{ROSC}}$), we obtain the final derived expression:\n$$E[X] = Q \\cdot p_{\\text{survival}|\\text{ROSC}} \\cdot p_{\\text{ROSC}}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to evaluate this expression using the provided values:\n- $Q = 0.50$\n- $p_{\\text{ROSC}} = 0.40$\n- $p_{\\text{survival}|\\text{ROSC}} = 0.20$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$E[X] = 0.50 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.40$$\nWe perform the multiplication:\n$$E[X] = 0.100 \\times 0.40$$\n$$E[X] = 0.0400$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The number $0.0400$ has its first significant figure as $4$, and the second is the following $0$. Therefore, rounding $0.0400$ to two significant figures gives $0.040$.

This practice expands the analysis to a head-to-head comparison of two such options: aggressive surgical intervention versus a shift to comfort-focused care .

The multidisciplinary team and parents are weighing two ethically permissible care options in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). You are asked to support the decision using an expected value approach grounded in the principles of beneficence (promotion of the patient’s good) and nonmaleficence (avoidance of harm). Assume a simplified decision model in which any benefit from survival is measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) conditional on survival, and any treatment-related burden is represented as a disutility in QALYs conditional on a harm event. Assume independence between survival and harm events and that the harm disutility is not already included in the conditional life-expectancy quality adjustment.\n\nOption I (escalate with laparotomy, postoperative intensive care, and full life-sustaining support):\n- Estimated probability of survival to leave the hospital: $0.35$.\n- Expected lifetime QALYs conditional on survival (incorporating discounting and anticipated quality of life with neurodevelopmental impairment): $9.0$.\n- Estimated probability of a severe treatment-related harm event producing sustained suffering or major iatrogenic burden: $0.85$.\n- QALY disutility conditional on such a harm event: $1.6$.\n\nOption P (redirect to comfort-focused care without surgery, noninvasive support only):\n- Estimated probability of survival beyond the neonatal period: $0.05$.\n- Expected QALYs conditional on survival (reflecting short-term life extension with comfort measures): $0.20$.\n- Estimated probability of a significant burden of refractory symptoms despite palliative measures: $0.25$.\n- QALY disutility conditional on such a burden: $0.15$.\n\nUsing first principles from probability theory (expected value) and the above ethical model of aggregating benefits and harms, compute for each option the expected net QALYs as the benefit from survival minus the expected disutility from harms. Then compute the net expected utility advantage of Option I over Option P, defined as the expected net QALYs for Option I minus the expected net QALYs for Option P. Round your final result to four significant figures. Express your answer in QALYs. Additionally, determine which option better aligns with the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence based on your computation, but report only the numerical net advantage as your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a formal calculation of the expected net utility for two alternative courses of action, Option I (intensive care) and Option P (palliative care), using the framework of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The expected net utility, denoted as $E[\\text{Net QALY}]$, is defined in the problem as the expected benefit from survival minus the expected disutility from harms.\n\nThe general formula for the expected net QALYs for any given option is derived from the principles of expected value. Let $S$ be the event of survival and $H$ be the event of a significant treatment-related harm.

Three candidates require ECMO now to prevent rapid deterioration. The institution’s ethics framework (beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) has been operationalized into a composite triage score that balances expected benefit, treatment burden, and urgency. From foundational principles, define the following components:\n\n- Probability of benefit as the incremental probability of achieving survival to discharge with acceptable neurodevelopmental outcome due to receiving ECMO, denoted $p_{\\text{benefit}} = P_{\\text{with}} - P_{\\text{without}}$, where $P_{\\text{with}}$ and $P_{\\text{without}}$ are probabilities with and without ECMO, respectively.\n- Treatment burden as a normalized expected disutility from ECMO, denoted $H_{\\text{burden}}$, computed as a weighted sum of expected days on invasive support and complication risks: \n$$\nH_{\\text{burden}} = d_v \\cdot V + d_c \\cdot P_{\\text{comp}} + d_p \\cdot P_{\\text{prolonged\\_pain}},\n$$\nwhere $V$ is expected ECMO days, $P_{\\text{comp}}$ is the probability of nonfatal complications requiring additional invasive procedures, and $P_{\\text{prolonged\\_pain}}$ is the probability of prolonged procedural pain despite standard analgesia.

A higher burden detracts from the total score. Candidate A has a moderate burden ($H_{\\text{burden, A}} = 0.461$), higher than Candidate B ($0.25$) but lower than Candidate C ($0.624$).\n- **Justice** (fairness in allocation, here operationalized as urgency) is captured by $U_{\\text{urgency}}$. Candidate A has a high urgency score ($U_{\\text{urgency, A}} \\approx 0.660$), second only to Candidate C.\n\nThe selection of Candidate A is ethically justifiable within this framework because their profile presents the best overall balance of high expected benefit, significant urgency, and a manageable treatment burden, as synthesized into the highest composite score.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the selected candidate's composite score $S$, rounded to four significant figures. The selected candidate is A, and their score is $S_A \\approx 0.1708308$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.1708$.",
