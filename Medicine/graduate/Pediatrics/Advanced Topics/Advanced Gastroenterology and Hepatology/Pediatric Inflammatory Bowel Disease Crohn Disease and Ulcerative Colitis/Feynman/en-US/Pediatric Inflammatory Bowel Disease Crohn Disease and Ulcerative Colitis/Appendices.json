            "solution": "The problem will be validated by first extracting the given information and then assessing its scientific validity and structural integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Diagnosis: Established ulcerative colitis.\n- Presenting complaint: Suspected severe flare.\n- Observation period: Last $24$ hours.\n- Abdominal pain: \"moderate\".\n- Rectal bleeding: \"small amount in most stools\".\n- Stool consistency: \"mostly completely unformed\".\n- Number of stools: $9$.\n- Nocturnal stools: Presence of \"at least one nocturnal stool\".\n- General activity level: \"severely restricted (mostly resting and not attending usual activities)\".\n- Task 1: Compute the total score using the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI).\n- Task 2: Determine if the presentation meets the criteria for acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) requiring hospital admission.\n- Task 3: Determine if rescue therapy should be considered on hospital day $3$ if the PUCAI score remains unchanged.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The PUCAI is a validated, non-invasive, and widely used clinical index in pediatric gastroenterology for quantifying disease activity in ulcerative colitis. The parameters provided (pain, bleeding, stool characteristics, activity) are the six components of the PUCAI score. The criteria for defining acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) and for considering rescue therapy based on PUCAI scores are consistent with established clinical practice guidelines (e.g., from the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [ECCO] and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition [ESPGHAN]). The problem is therefore scientifically and factually sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary inputs to calculate the PUCAI score. Each qualitative description (\"moderate\", \"severely restricted\") maps to a specific, unique numerical value within the PUCAI framework. The calculation is a simple summation, leading to a unique solution.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem uses standard clinical terminology that has precise definitions within the context of the PUCAI score, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) is calculated as the unweighted sum of scores from six clinical domains. The total score can range from $0$ to $85$. We will calculate the score for each domain based on the provided data.\n\n1.  **Abdominal Pain**: The patient describes abdominal pain as \"moderate\". In the PUCAI framework, this corresponds to the \"Moderate-Severe\" category.\n    - Score for Abdominal Pain $= 10$ points.\n\n2.  **Rectal Bleeding**: The report states \"rectal bleeding is present as a small amount in most stools\". This description matches a specific category in the PUCAI.\n    - Score for Rectal Bleeding $= 20$ points.\n\n3.  **Stool Consistency**: The consistency of most stools is described as \"completely unformed\".\n    - Score for Stool Consistency $= 10$ points.\n\n4.  **Number of Stools**: The child passed $9$ stools in the last $24$ hours. This falls into the highest frequency category, which is for more than $8$ stools.\n    - Score for Number of Stools ($>8$) $= 15$ points.\n\n5.  **Nocturnal Stools**: The presence of \"at least one nocturnal stool\" is reported. The PUCAI records this as a binary yes/no variable.\n    - Score for Nocturnal Stools (Yes) $= 10$ points.\n\n6.  **General Activity**: The child's activity is \"severely restricted\". This is a direct descriptor for a scoring category.\n    - Score for General Activity $= 10$ points.\n\nThe total PUCAI score is the sum of the scores from these six components:\n$$\n\\text{PUCAI} = (\\text{Pain}) + (\\text{Bleeding}) + (\\text{Consistency}) + (\\text{Frequency}) + (\\text{Nocturnal}) + (\\text{Activity})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{PUCAI} = 10 + 20 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 10 = 75\n$$\nThe computed PUCAI score is $75$.\n\nNext, we address the clinical management questions based on this score.\n\n**Determination of Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis (ASUC)**\nA PUCAI score of $\\ge 65$ is the established definition for acute severe ulcerative colitis in children, warranting hospital admission for intravenous corticosteroid therapy. The calculated score is $75$. Since $75 \\ge 65$, the patient's presentation unequivocally meets the criteria for ASUC, and hospital admission is indicated.\n\n**Consideration for Rescue Therapy**\nThe standard of care for ASUC involves a re-evaluation of disease activity after $3$ to $5$ days of intravenous corticosteroid treatment. A common and validated threshold for predicting corticosteroid treatment failure is a PUCAI score $\\ge 45$ on day $3$ of therapy. The problem posits that the PUCAI remains unchanged at $75$ on hospital day $3$. As $75$ is significantly greater than the threshold of $45$, this represents a clear non-response to corticosteroids. Therefore, initiation of rescue therapy (e.g., with a calcineurin inhibitor like ciclosporin or a biologic agent like infliximab) should be strongly considered at this time to prevent progression to colectomy.\n\nThe final answer requested is the computed PUCAI score.",

The first significant figure is the $1$ in the hundredths place. The fourth significant figure is the $2$ in the ten-thousandths place. The following digit is $6$, so we round up.\n$$\\Delta R \\approx 0.01033$$\n\nPart 3: Clinical Reasoning for Steroid-Sparing Strategies\n\nThe patient's history of four flares within $12$ months, requiring multiple courses of systemic glucocorticoids and a bridging course, is indicative of steroid-dependent or frequently relapsing Crohn's disease. The primary management goal is to induce and maintain long-term, steroid-free remission to prevent disease progression, complications, and side effects from chronic steroid use, such as the increased fracture risk calculated above. Two high-priority steroid-sparing strategies are:\n\n1.  Initiation of Biologic Therapy: The most effective strategy for moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease is the introduction of a biologic agent. Agents targeting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF$\\alpha$), such as infliximab or adalimumab, or those targeting gut-specific leukocyte trafficking, like the anti-integrin vedolizumab, are standard of care. These therapies are highly effective for inducing and maintaining remission, leading to mucosal healing and a significant reduction or elimination of the need for glucocorticoids. Given the patient's disease course, initiation of a biologic is a critical next step.\n\n2.  Optimization of Immunomodulator Therapy: Thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine) or methotrexate are immunomodulators used for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. If the patient is not already on one of these agents, one should be started. If the patient is already on a thiopurine, therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed to ensure the dose is optimized for maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity. Immunomodulators can be used as monotherapy, but are often used in combination with a biologic agent. Combination therapy has been shown to be superior to monotherapy in many cases, increasing the effectiveness of the biologic and reducing the likelihood of developing anti-drug antibodies, thereby prolonging the biologic's efficacy.\n\nThese strategies shift the treatment paradigm from reactive management of flares with steroids to proactive maintenance of remission with targeted, long-term therapies.",

Then, exponentiating both sides of the equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{EH},D}(C)}{1-P_{\\mathrm{EH},D}(C)} = \\exp(L_{D}(C)) $$\nSolving for $P_{\\mathrm{EH},D}(C)$:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{EH},D}(C) = [1-P_{\\mathrm{EH},D}(C)] \\exp(L_{D}(C)) $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{EH},D}(C) = \\exp(L_{D}(C)) - P_{\\mathrm{EH},D}(C)\\exp(L_{D}(C)) $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{EH},D}(C) [1 + \\exp(L_{D}(C))] = \\exp(L_{D}(C)) $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{EH},D}(C) = \\frac{\\exp(L_{D}(C))}{1 + \\exp(L_{D}(C))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-L_{D}(C))} $$\nThis is the equation we will use to compute the probabilities.\n\nTo find the concentration $C$ that yields a target probability $P_{\\mathrm{target}}$, we rearrange the initial model equation:\n$$ \\alpha_{D} + \\beta_{D}\\, C = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{target}}}{1-P_{\\mathrm{target}}}\\right) $$\n$$ \\beta_{D}\\, C = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{target}}}{1-P_{\\mathrm{target}}}\\right) - \\alpha_{D} $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{D}} \\left[ \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{target}}}{1-P_{\\mathrm{target}}}\\right) - \\alpha_{D} \\right] $$\nThis is the equation we will use to compute the target concentrations.\n\n#### Part 1: Compute $P_{\\mathrm{EH},\\mathrm{CD}}(7.0)$ and $P_{\\mathrm{EH},\\mathrm{UC}}(7.0)$\n\nFor a trough concentration of $C = 7.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$:\n\n**Crohn's Disease (CD):**\nThe parameters are $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{CD}} = -1.2$ and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{CD}} = 0.22$.
