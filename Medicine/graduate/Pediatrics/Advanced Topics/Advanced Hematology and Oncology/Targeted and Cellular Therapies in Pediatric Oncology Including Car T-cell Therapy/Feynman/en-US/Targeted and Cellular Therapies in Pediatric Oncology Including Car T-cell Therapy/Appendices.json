            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient: $12$-year-old boy\n- Diagnosis: Relapsed cluster of differentiation $19$ (CD$19$) positive B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)\n- Therapy: Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy infused on day $0$.\n- Onset of symptoms: Day $3$ post-infusion.\n- Clinical signs and vital signs:\n    - Fever: Temperature of $39.4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n    - Tachycardia: Heart rate of $145\\,\\mathrm{beats/min}$.\n    - Dyspnea: New onset.\n    - Hypotension: Blood pressure of $82/40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ after administration of $40\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$ isotonic crystalloid.\n    - Vasopressor support: Norepinephrine initiated at a rate of $0.06\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\n    - Hypoxia: Oxygen saturation of $88\\%$ on room air.\n    - Respiratory support: Saturation improved to $94\\%$ on high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at a flow rate of $25\\,\\mathrm{L/min}$ with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO$_2$) of $0.40$.\n- Physical examination findings:\n    - Bilateral crackles in the lungs.\n    - No focal source of infection.\n- Laboratory results:\n    - C-reactive protein (CRP): $180\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n    - Ferritin: $6000\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\n    - Interleukin (IL)-$6$: $220\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$.\n- Microbiology: Blood cultures are pending.\n- Task: Identify the dominant pathobiology and assign the correct cytokine release syndrome (CRS) grade according to the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) pediatric criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The clinical scenario described is a classic presentation of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), a known and well-characterized complication of CAR T-cell therapy. The pathophysiology involving cytokine-mediated endothelial damage, capillary leak, and systemic inflammation is firmly established. The vital signs, laboratory values (elevated CRP, ferritin, IL-$6$), and required medical interventions (fluids, vasopressors, high-flow oxygen) are all consistent and realistic for this condition. The ASTCT criteria represent the current standard of care for grading CRS.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient, non-contradictory data to deduce the underlying pathophysiology and apply the specific ASTCT grading criteria. A unique and stable solution can be derived from the provided information.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is described using precise, objective clinical terminology and quantitative data, avoiding subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe patient has received CAR T-cells engineered to target the CD$19$ antigen on his B-cell ALL. The core of the subsequent events is rooted in fundamental immunology and microvascular physiology.\n\n1.  **Immunological Activation:** On day $3$, the infused CAR T-cells have located and engaged with the CD$19$-positive leukemic cells. This antigen-specific binding activates the CAR T-cells, triggering a potent effector response. Activated T-cells proliferate and release a primary wave of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-$\\gamma$) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\\alpha$).\n\n2.  **Cytokine Amplification Loop:** These primary cytokines are not the sole actors. They activate bystander immune cells, particularly monocytes and macrophages. This leads to a crucial amplification loop where these myeloid cells release a massive secondary wave of cytokines, including Interleukin-$1$ (IL-$1$) and, most prominently, Interleukin-$6$ (IL-$6$). The patient's elevated IL-$6$ level of $220\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$ is direct evidence of this key pathophysiological step. The high ferritin ($6000\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$) and CRP ($180\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$) are further markers of this systemic hyperinflammatory state, often termed a \"cytokine storm.\"\n\n3.  **Microvascular Pathophysiology:** The cytokine storm has profound effects on the vascular endothelium.\n    - **Endothelial Dysfunction and Capillary Leak:** IL-$6$ and other cytokines cause widespread activation and injury to endothelial cells. This disrupts the integrity of intercellular junctions, leading to a \"capillary leak\" syndrome. Plasma and proteins extravasate from the intravascular compartment into the interstitial space. In the lungs, this manifests as non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which explains the patient's bilateral crackles, dyspnea, and hypoxia (O$_2$ saturation of $88\\%$).\n    - **Vasodilation and Distributive Shock:** Cytokines, both directly and via induction of mediators like nitric oxide (NO), cause systemic vasodilation. This leads to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The combination of reduced effective circulating volume (due to capillary leak) and decreased SVR results in distributive shock. The patient's hypotension ($82/40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) is refractory to a significant fluid challenge ($40\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg}$), indicating a state of shock that requires vasoconstrictor support. The initiation of norepinephrine, a vasopressor, confirms the presence of distributive shock.\n\n**Assignment of CRS Grade**\n\nThe ASTCT pediatric criteria grade CRS severity based on the presence of fever and the level of support required for hypotension and hypoxia.\n\n- **Grade 1:** Fever ($\\ge 38.0\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$) without hypotension or hypoxia.\n- **Grade 2:** Fever plus hypotension responsive to fluids OR hypoxia requiring low-flow oxygen (e.g., standard nasal cannula $\\le 6\\,\\mathrm{L/min}$).\n- **Grade 3:** Fever plus hypotension requiring a **single vasopressor** OR hypoxia requiring **high-flow oxygen** (e.g., HFNC).\n- **Grade 4:** Fever plus hypotension requiring **multiple vasopressors** OR hypoxia requiring positive pressure ventilation (e.g., intubation).\n- **Grade 5:** Death.\n\nApplying these criteria to the patient's data:\n- **Hypotension:** The patient's blood pressure is $82/40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ despite fluid resuscitation and requires a **single vasopressor** (norepinephrine). This meets the criterion for Grade $3$ CRS.\n- **Hypoxia:** The patient requires **high-flow nasal cannula** ($25\\,\\mathrm{L/min}$) to maintain adequate oxygenation. This also meets the criterion for Grade $3$ CRS.\n\nSince the patient's condition meets the criteria for Grade $3$ based on both cardiovascular and respiratory parameters, the overall CRS grade is **Grade 3**.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. IL-$6$–driven monocyte/macrophage activation causing endothelial dysfunction, capillary leak, and nitric oxide–mediated vasodilation; Grade $3$ CRS due to need for one vasopressor and high-flow oxygen.**\n- **Mechanism:** This description is an accurate and precise summary of the pathophysiology derived from first principles. It correctly identifies IL-$6$, monocyte/macrophage activation, endothelial dysfunction, capillary leak, and vasodilation as the central elements.\n- **Grade:** The grade is correctly assigned as Grade $3$, and the justification (need for one vasopressor and high-flow oxygen) is perfectly aligned with the ASTCT criteria and the patient's clinical status.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Bacterial sepsis as the primary driver of shock; Grade $4$ CRS because multiple vasopressors or intubation are required.**\n- **Mechanism:** While sepsis must be ruled out, the clinical context (day $3$ post-CAR T), hyperferritinemia, and lack of a focal infection source make CRS the far more likely primary driver. The question asks for the pathobiology reasoned from the therapy itself.\n- **Grade:** The assigned grade is factually incorrect. The patient is on one, not multiple, vasopressors, and is on HFNC, not intubated. This describes Grade $3$, not Grade $4$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) predominates via blood–brain barrier disruption; Grade $2$ CRS based on low-flow oxygen and fluid-responsive hypotension.**\n- **Mechanism:** There is no information in the problem statement to suggest neurotoxicity (ICANS) is present, let alone predominating. The clinical picture is one of cardiorespiratory failure.\n- **Grade:** The grade and its justification are factually incorrect. The patient requires high-flow, not low-flow, oxygen. The hypotension is refractory to fluids (requiring a pressor), not fluid-responsive. These features correspond to Grade $3$, not Grade $2$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. T-cell cytotoxic depletion leading to cytokine deficiency and immunoparesis; Grade $1$ CRS because there is only fever without cardiorespiratory compromise.**\n- **Mechanism:** This describes the opposite of the actual pathophysiology. CRS is a state of massive cytokine excess, not deficiency. T-cell depletion (exhaustion) is a different, often later, phenomenon.\n- **Grade:** The assigned grade is a gross mischaracterization of the patient's severe illness. The patient has profound cardiorespiratory compromise, which is the definition of CRS grades higher than $1$.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

He developed grade $1$ cytokine release syndrome with fever and tachycardia, treated with supportive care; no sedatives or anti-seizure medications have been given. Over the last $12$ hours, he is increasingly disoriented and has word-finding difficulty and cannot produce a written sentence. On examination, he follows a simple command, correctly names $2$ of $3$ common objects, and is oriented to month and city but not to year, hospital, or the head of state. His writing sample is blank despite effort. Vital signs show blood pressure of $110/70$ mmHg, heart rate of $110$ beats/minute, and oxygen saturation of $98\\%$ on room air. Laboratory values include interleukin-$6$ (IL-$6$) of $800$ pg/mL, interleukin-$1\\beta$ (IL-$1\\beta$) of $120$ pg/mL, ferritin of $3{,}000$ ng/mL, and serum albumin of $3.2$ g/dL. Electroencephalography shows diffuse slowing without epileptiform discharges; brain magnetic resonance imaging is without acute infarct or hemorrhage.\n\nAssume cerebral microvascular fluid exchange follows the Starling principle, with net fluid flux across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) given by\n$$\nJ_v \\;=\\; K_f \\,\\Big[ (P_c - P_i) \\;-\\; \\sigma \\, (\\pi_c - \\pi_i) \\Big],\n$$\nwhere $J_v$ is the volume flux into the interstitium, $K_f$ is the filtration coefficient, $P_c$ and $P_i$ are capillary and interstitial hydrostatic pressures, $\\pi_c$ and $\\pi_i$ are capillary and interstitial oncotic pressures, and $\\sigma$ is the reflection coefficient. In health, for cerebral microvessels, take $P_c = 25$ mmHg, $P_i = 5$ mmHg, $\\pi_c = 25$ mmHg, $\\pi_i = 5$ mmHg, $K_f = 0.02$ mL/min/mmHg, and $\\sigma = 1.0$. In the current cytokine milieu, endothelial activation reduces tight junction integrity and increases transcellular transport; model this as $K_f = 0.06$ mL/min/mmHg and $\\sigma = 0.6$, with the same pressures as above.\n\nStarting from these fundamental definitions of capillary fluid exchange and BBB physiology, and using established pediatric neuro-assessment frameworks for immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), determine the dominant pathophysiologic mechanism and the appropriate assessment approach to correctly grade this child’s neurotoxicity severity. Which option best integrates the mechanism and assessment?\n\nA. Cytokine-mediated endothelial activation increasing $K_f$ and decreasing $\\sigma$ across the BBB, causing net interstitial filtration and cerebral edema; assess with the Immune Effector Cell Encephalopathy (ICE) score and grade using American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) pediatric ICANS criteria; the findings correspond to Grade $2$ ICANS.\n\nB.

Tocilizumab-induced paradoxical central interleukin-$6$ accumulation as the sole mechanism; assess with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS); the child’s findings are Grade $3$ ICANS because the ICE score is $0$–$2$.",
            "solution": "The problem is grounded in established medical science. The clinical picture is a classic presentation of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) following CAR T-cell therapy. The use of the Starling equation to model blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a valid and instructive biophysical application. The assessment tools mentioned (ICE score, ASTCT criteria) are the current clinical standard. The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**1. Pathophysiological Mechanism Analysis**\nThe problem directs us to analyze the pathophysiology using the provided Starling equation, which describes net fluid flux ($J_v$). A positive $J_v$ implies net filtration into the interstitium (edema).\n\nFirst, we calculate the flux for the healthy state:\n- Hydrostatic pressure gradient: $\\Delta P = P_c - P_i = 25 - 5 = 20$ mmHg.\n- Oncotic pressure gradient: $\\Delta \\pi = \\pi_c - \\pi_i = 25 - 5 = 20$ mmHg.\nThe net fluid flux in the healthy state is:\n$$ J_v(\\text{health}) = K_f [ \\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\pi ] = 0.02 [ 20 - (1.0)(20) ] = 0 \\text{ mL/min} $$\nThis confirms a healthy BBB prevents net fluid movement.\n\nNext, we analyze the patient's pathological state. The cytokine milieu increases permeability, modeled as an increased filtration coefficient ($K_f = 0.06$) and a decreased reflection coefficient ($\\sigma = 0.6$).\n$$ J_v(\\text{patient}) = K_f [ \\Delta P - \\sigma \\Delta \\pi ] = 0.06 [ 20 - (0.6)(20) ] $$\n$$ J_v(\\text{patient}) = 0.06 [ 20 - 12 ] = 0.06 [8] = 0.48 \\text{ mL/min} $$\nSince $J_v > 0$, there is net fluid filtration into the brain's interstitium, a process called vasogenic cerebral edema. The dominant mechanism is cytokine-mediated endothelial activation leading to increased BBB permeability.\n\n**2. Clinical Assessment and Grading**\nThe standard tool for grading ICANS is the Immune Effector Cell-Associated Encephalopathy (ICE) score, as part of the ASTCT criteria. The ICE score is a $10$-point assessment:\n- **Orientation (4 points):** The patient is oriented to month (1 pt) and city (1 pt) but not to year (0 pt) or hospital (0 pt). Total = 2 points.\n- **Naming (3 points):** The patient correctly names 2 of 3 objects. Total = 2 points.\n- **Following Commands (1 point):** The patient follows a simple command. Total = 1 point.\n- **Writing (1 point):** The patient \"cannot produce a written sentence\" (agraphia). Total = 0 points.\n- **Attention (1 point):** Per scoring guidelines, if a patient is unable to perform the task (e.g., counting backwards) due to encephalopathy, the score is 0. Total = 0 points.\n\nThe total ICE score is:\n$$ \\text{ICE Score} = 2 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 5 $$\nApplying the ASTCT ICANS grading rubric:\n- **Grade 1:** ICE score of 7–9.\n- **Grade 2:** ICE score of 3–6.\n- **Grade 3:** ICE score of 0–2.\n- **Grade 4:** ICE score of 0 plus life-threatening symptoms.\n\nThe patient's ICE score of 5 corresponds to **Grade 2 ICANS**.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Cytokine-mediated endothelial activation increasing $K_f$ and decreasing $\\sigma$ across the BBB, causing net interstitial filtration and cerebral edema; assess with the Immune Effector Cell Encephalopathy (ICE) score and grade using American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) pediatric ICANS criteria; the findings correspond to Grade $2$ ICANS.**\n- **Pathophysiology:** Matches our derivation.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the ICE score and ASTCT criteria.\n- **Grading:** Correctly identifies Grade 2 based on an ICE score of 5.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Direct CAR T-cell binding to neuronal CD19 causing demyelination; assess severity with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and classify as Grade $3$ ICANS due to focal deficits.**\n- **Pathophysiology:** Not supported by the data or Starling model.\n- **Assessment:** NIHSS is for stroke, not ICANS.\n- **Grading:** The calculated grade is 2, not 3.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Immune complex vasculitis producing microthrombi and multifocal ischemia; assess with the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC); the ICE score would be $9$, indicating Grade $1$ ICANS.**\n- **Pathophysiology:** MRI was negative for infarct, arguing against this mechanism.\n- **Assessment:** PCPC is an outcome scale, not an acute assessment tool.\n- **Grading:** The ICE score is 5, not 9. The grade is 2, not 1.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Tocilizumab-induced paradoxical central interleukin-6 accumulation as the sole mechanism; assess with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS); the child’s findings are Grade $3$ ICANS because the ICE score is $0$–$2$.**\n- **Pathophysiology:** No mention of the patient receiving tocilizumab.\n- **Assessment:** EDSS is for multiple sclerosis.\n- **Grading:** The ICE score is 5, not 0–2. The grade is 2, not 3.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe analysis confirms that the pathophysiology involves cytokine-driven endothelial damage leading to vasogenic edema. The clinical presentation, when formally assessed with the ICE score, yields a value of 5, which corresponds to Grade 2 ICANS by ASTCT criteria. Option A is the only one that correctly integrates all these components.",

            "problem": "A pediatric patient weighing $25$ kilograms with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia receives Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy targeting cluster of differentiation $19$. During the early post-infusion period, Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) are managed using established principles: cytokine mass balance, cell population dynamics, and receptor occupancy pharmacodynamics. Assume the following fundamental bases and well-tested biological facts hold:\n\n- CAR T-cell expansion in vivo can be approximated near its peak by logistic growth with carrying capacity $K$ cells, which implies the peak cell count occurs at $K/2$.\n- Interleukin-$6$ (IL-$6$) concentration $I(t)$ obeys a mass balance with production proportional to CAR T-cell burden and first-order elimination, so that under a quasi-steady assumption at peak expansion, $I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ is the ratio of the production rate to the elimination rate constant.\n- The blood plasma volume scales with body weight as $50$ milliliters per kilogram.\n- Tocilizumab, an interleukin-$6$ receptor antagonist used for CRS management, reduces effective signaling via fractional receptor blockade that follows a receptor-occupancy relationship depending on drug concentration.\n- For ICANS, corticosteroids are often required because tocilizumab does not directly address neurotoxicity; however, this scenario focuses on determining the tocilizumab dose needed to control IL-$6$ mediated CRS while neurotoxicity monitoring proceeds in parallel.\n\nYou are provided the following scientifically plausible parameters:\n\n- Body weight $w = 25$ kilograms.\n- Plasma volume per kilogram $= 50$ milliliters per kilogram.\n- CAR T-cell carrying capacity $K = 2.5 \\times 10^{9}$ cells, so the peak expansion occurs at $K/2$.\n- At peak expansion, CAR T-cell-driven IL-$6$ production per cell is $s = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ picograms per cell per hour.\n- IL-$6$ elimination rate constant $k = 0.5$ hour$^{-1}$.\n- The hemodynamic stability target for CRS management is to reduce effective IL-$6$ signaling at peak to $S_{\\mathrm{th}} = 40$ picograms per milliliter.\n- Immediately after a single tocilizumab infusion given at the time of peak expansion, assume the tocilizumab concentration in the central compartment equals the dose divided by the central volume, with the central volume approximated by the plasma volume. The fractional interleukin-$6$ receptor blockade is $\\theta(C_T) = \\dfrac{C_T}{K_d + C_T}$ where $C_T$ is the tocilizumab concentration and $K_d = 1.0$ milligrams per liter.\n- The effective IL-$6$ signaling after blockade is $S = (1 - \\theta) I$.\n\nUsing only the principles above, determine the minimal tocilizumab dose $D$ (in milligrams) that would ensure the effective IL-$6$ signaling at peak expansion is at or below $S_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Round your final numeric answer to three significant figures and express it in milligrams. Do not include units in your final boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles, is well-posed, internally consistent, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The simplified models used (logistic growth, single-compartment pharmacokinetics, quasi-steady state) are standard and appropriate for such a theoretical problem.\n\nThe objective is to find the minimal dose $D$ of tocilizumab required to reduce the effective Interleukin-$6$ (IL-6) signaling to a target threshold $S_{\\mathrm{th}}$ at the peak of CAR T-cell expansion. The solution will proceed in a stepwise manner.\n\nFirst, we determine the patient's plasma volume, which is assumed to be the central volume of distribution for the drug.\nThe body weight is given as $w = 25$ kilograms, and the plasma volume scales as $50$ milliliters per kilogram.\n$$V_p = w \\times 50 \\, \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{kg}} = 25 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 50 \\, \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{kg}} = 1250 \\, \\text{ml}$$\nFor consistency with the units of the dissociation constant ($K_d$), we convert this volume to liters:\n$$V_p = 1250 \\, \\text{ml} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{L}}{1000 \\, \\text{ml}} = 1.25 \\, \\text{L}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the number of CAR T-cells at the peak of expansion. The problem states that the carrying capacity is $K = 2.5 \\times 10^9$ cells and defines the peak expansion for this calculation to occur at half the carrying capacity.\n$$N_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{K}{2} = \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{cells}}{2} = 1.25 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{cells}$$\n\nThird, we determine the peak concentration of IL-$6$, denoted as $I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$. This is based on a mass-balance model at a quasi-steady state. The rate of IL-$6$ mass production equals the rate of IL-$6$ mass elimination.\nThe total production rate is the production rate per cell, $s$, multiplied by the number of cells, $N_{\\mathrm{peak}}$.\n$$\\text{Production Rate} = s \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{peak}}$$\nThe elimination is a first-order process, so the total elimination rate is the product of the elimination rate constant $k$, the concentration $I$, and the volume $V_p$.\n$$\\text{Elimination Rate} = k \\cdot I \\cdot V_p$$\nAt quasi-steady state, Production Rate = Elimination Rate.\n$$s \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{peak}} = k \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\cdot V_p$$\nSolving for $I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{s \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{peak}}}{k \\cdot V_p}$$\nSubstituting the given values: $s = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ picograms per cell per hour, $k = 0.5$ hour$^{-1}$, and $V_p = 1250$ ml.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\frac{\\text{pg}}{\\text{cell} \\cdot \\text{hr}}) \\times (1.25 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{cells})}{(0.5 \\, \\text{hr}^{-1}) \\times (1250 \\, \\text{ml})} = \\frac{1.25 \\times 10^5 \\, \\frac{\\text{pg}}{\\text{hr}}}{625 \\, \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}}} = 200 \\, \\frac{\\text{pg}}{\\text{ml}}$$\n\nFourth, we determine the required fractional receptor blockade, $\\theta$, to achieve the target effective signaling level, $S_{\\mathrm{th}} = 40$ picograms per milliliter. The effective signaling is $S = (1 - \\theta) I$. We need to find the minimal dose, which corresponds to the case where the effective signaling is exactly at the threshold.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{th}} = (1 - \\theta) I_{\\mathrm{peak}}$$\nSolving for $\\theta$:\n$$1 - \\theta = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{th}}}{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}}$$\n$$\\theta = 1 - \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{th}}}{I_{\\mathrm{peak}}} = 1 - \\frac{40 \\, \\text{pg/ml}}{200 \\, \\text{pg/ml}} = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$$\nA receptor blockade of $80\\%$ is required.\n\nFifth, we calculate the tocilizumab concentration, $C_T$, needed to achieve this blockade. The fractional blockade is given by the receptor-occupancy relationship:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{C_T}{K_d + C_T}$$\nWe solve for $C_T$ with $\\theta = 0.8$ and the given dissociation constant $K_d = 1.0$ milligram per liter.\n$$\\theta(K_d + C_T) = C_T$$\n$$\\theta K_d = C_T - \\theta C_T = C_T(1 - \\theta)$$\n$$C_T = \\frac{\\theta K_d}{1 - \\theta} = \\frac{0.8 \\times (1.0 \\, \\text{mg/L})}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{0.8}{0.2} \\, \\text{mg/L} = 4.0 \\, \\text{mg/L}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the minimal dose $D$ of tocilizumab. The problem states that the tocilizumab concentration in the central compartment (approximated by plasma volume $V_p$) is the dose divided by this volume.\n$$C_T = \\frac{D}{V_p}$$\nSolving for the dose $D$:\n$$D = C_T \\cdot V_p$$\nUsing the calculated required concentration $C_T = 4.0$ mg/L and plasma volume $V_p = 1.25$ L:\n$$D = (4.0 \\, \\text{mg/L}) \\times (1.25 \\, \\text{L}) = 5.0 \\, \\text{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated dose is exactly $5.0$ milligrams. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $5.00$.",
