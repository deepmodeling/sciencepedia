            "problem": "A rare autosomal recessive Lysosomal Storage Disease (LSD) is observed in a pediatric population with birth prevalence $q^{2} = \\frac{1}{40{,}000}$. Assume this population satisfies the conditions of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), namely random mating, large population size, negligible migration, mutation and selection at birth, and allele frequencies that sum to one. Let $p$ denote the frequency of the normal allele and $q$ denote the frequency of the mutant allele, with $p+q=1$. Under HWE, genotype frequencies are $p^{2}$ (homozygous normal), $2pq$ (heterozygous carriers), and $q^{2}$ (homozygous affected).\n\nPart 1: Using only the foundational definitions of HWE, derive an expression for the carrier frequency $2pq$ in terms of $q$ and compute its value given $q^{2} = \\frac{1}{40{,}000}$.\n\nPart 2: Consider a consanguineous union between first cousins from the same population. Let the inbreeding coefficient $F$ for the offspring of first cousins be $F = \\frac{1}{16}$, where $F$ is defined as the probability that the two alleles at a locus in an individual are identical by descent. Derive the probability that their child is affected by the autosomal recessive LSD in terms of $p$, $q$, and $F$, starting from the definition of $F$ and HWE principles, and then evaluate it numerically for $F = \\frac{1}{16}$ and $q^{2} = \\frac{1}{40{,}000}$.\n\nReport your final results as two decimal numbers in the order $\\big(2pq,\\ \\text{affected risk for first-cousin offspring}\\big)$, and round both to four significant figures. Express both values as decimals (not percentages).",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and the concept of inbreeding. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions ($q^2 = \\frac{1}{40{,}000}$, $F = \\frac{1}{16}$) to arrive at a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters are realistic.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested. Let $p$ be the frequency of the normal allele and $q$ be the frequency of the mutant allele for the specified autosomal recessive Lysosomal Storage Disease (LSD).\n\n**Part 1: Carrier Frequency in the General Population**\n\nThe problem states that the population satisfies the conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. A foundational principle of HWE is that the sum of allele frequencies at a biallelic locus is unity.\n$$p + q = 1$$\nThe birth prevalence of the disease, which corresponds to the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$), is given as $q^2$.\n$$q^2 = \\frac{1}{40{,}000}$$\nFrom this, we can calculate the frequency of the mutant allele, $q$:\n$$q = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{40{,}000}} = \\frac{1}{200} = 0.005$$\nThe frequency of the normal allele, $p$, is then:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$$\nThe carrier frequency is the frequency of the heterozygous genotype ($Aa$), which is given by $2pq$ under HWE. The problem asks for an expression for $2pq$ in terms of $q$. We use the relation $p = 1 - q$:\n$$2pq = 2(1-q)q = 2q - 2q^2$$\nThis is the derived expression for the carrier frequency in terms of $q$.\nWe now compute the numerical value of the carrier frequency:\n$$2pq = 2(0.995)(0.005) = 0.00995$$\n\n**Part 2: Risk of Affected Offspring in a First-Cousin Union**\n\nWe are asked to derive the probability that a child of first cousins is affected by the LSD. The genetic relationship between the parents is quantified by the inbreeding coefficient, $F$, which is the probability that the two alleles at a given locus in their offspring are identical by descent (IBD). For the offspring of first cousins, $F = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe probability of an individual having the affected genotype ($aa$) can be determined by considering two mutually exclusive events:\n$1$. The two alleles at the locus are identical by descent. The probability of this event is $F$. If the alleles are IBD, the child will be homozygous $aa$ if the single ancestral allele they both descend from was the mutant allele '$a$'. The probability of this is the frequency of the '$a$' allele in the population, which is $q$. Therefore, the probability of being $aa$ through this path is $F \\times q$.\n\n$2$. The two alleles at the locus are not identical by descent. The probability of this event is $1-F$. If the alleles are not IBD, they are independent draws from the population's gene pool. The probability of drawing two '$a$' alleles independently is $q \\times q = q^2$. Therefore, the probability of being $aa$ through this path is $(1-F) \\times q^2$.\n\nThe total probability of the offspring being affected, $P(aa)$, is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(aa) = (F \\times q) + ((1-F) \\times q^2)$$\nThis is the derived probability. To express it in the common form involving $p, q, F$, we can algebraically rearrange the expression:\n$$P(aa) = Fq + q^2 - Fq^2 = q^2 + F(q - q^2) = q^2 + Fq(1-q)$$\nSince $p = 1 - q$, we obtain the standard formula for the frequency of a recessive homozygote with inbreeding:\n$$P(aa) = q^2 + Fpq$$\nWe now evaluate this probability numerically using the given and calculated values: $F = \\frac{1}{16} = 0.0625$, $q = 0.005$, and $p = 0.995$.\n$$P(aa) = (0.005)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)(0.995)(0.005)$$\n$$P(aa) = 0.000025 + (0.0625)(0.004975)$$\n$$P(aa) = 0.000025 + 0.0003109375$$\n$$P(aa) = 0.0003359375$$\n\n**Final Results and Rounding**\n\nThe problem requires the two results reported as decimal numbers rounded to four significant figures.\n\nValue 1: Carrier frequency, $2pq = 0.00995$. To four significant figures, this is $0.009950$.\n\nValue 2: Risk for first-cousin offspring, $P(aa) = 0.0003359375$. To four significant figures, this is $0.0003359$.\n\nThese two values are reported in the specified order.",

However, interpreting a positive screen for a rare condition is not straightforward, as this problem illustrates .

Then compute the PPV for the given parameters. Express your final numerical result as a decimal fraction (not a percentage) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard application of Bayes' theorem to medical diagnostics, providing all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the formula for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and then calculate its numerical value for the given parameters. The PPV is the probability that an individual has the disease given that they test positive, denoted as $P(D \\mid T^+)$.\n\nLet us define the events:\n$D$: The event that an infant has Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I).\n$D^c$: The event that an infant does not have MPS I.\n$T^+$: The event that the screening test result is positive.\n$T^-$: The event that the screening test result is negative.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The prevalence of the disease: $P(D) = \\frac{1}{10{,}000} = 0.0001$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test: This is the probability of a positive test result given that the infant has the disease. $P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.95$.\n3.  The specificity of the test: This is the probability of a negative test result given that the infant does not have the disease. $P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.99$.\n\nThe quantity we seek to derive is the PPV, which is the conditional probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$. We start with Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator contains terms that are directly given: the sensitivity $P(T^+ \\mid D)$ and the prevalence $P(D)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, by summing over the two mutually exclusive and exhaustive states: having the disease ($D$) or not having the disease ($D^c$):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need $P(D^c)$ and $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$.\nThe probability of not having the disease, $P(D^c)$, is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\text{prevalence}$$\nThe term $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test given no disease, which is the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $P(T^- \\mid D^c)$:\n$$P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)+ (1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c))(1 - P(D))$$\n\nNow we substitute this complete expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the denominator of Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + (1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c))(1 - P(D))}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$PPV = \\frac{\\text{sensitivity} \\times \\text{prevalence}}{(\\text{sensitivity} \\times \\text{prevalence}) + ((1 - \\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence}))}$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\nPrevalence: $P(D) = 0.0001$\nSensitivity: $P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.95$\nSpecificity: $P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.99$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required components:\n$1 - \\text{specificity} = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$\n$1 - \\text{prevalence} = 1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999$\n\nNow, we calculate the terms in the PPV formula:\nThe numerator (true positives):\n$$\\text{sensitivity} \\times \\text{prevalence} = 0.95 \\times 0.0001 = 0.000095$$\nThe first term in the denominator is the same as the numerator: $0.000095$.\nThe second term in the denominator (false positives):\n$$(1 - \\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence}) = 0.01 \\times 0.9999 = 0.009999$$\nThe total denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.000095 + 0.009999 = 0.010094$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.000095}{0.010094} \\approx 0.0094115316...$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $9$, the second is $4$, the third is $1$, and the fourth is $1$. The digit following the fourth significant figure is $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$PPV \\approx 0.009412$$\nThis result demonstrates a crucial concept in medical screening: for a disease with low prevalence, even a test with high sensitivity and specificity can have a very low positive predictive value. In this case, only about $0.94\\%$ of infants who test positive actually have the disease.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of enzyme kinetics and molecular genetics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated objectively.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics to the specified genetic scenarios. The total enzymatic rate, $v$, is given by the equation:\n$$v = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E_T] \\frac{[S]}{K_{M} + [S]}$$\nwhere $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ is the turnover number, $[E_T]$ is the total concentration of active enzyme sites, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_{M}$ is the Michaelis constant. The problem states that the contributions from each allele add linearly, which means we sum the rates produced by the enzyme populations corresponding to each functional allele.\n\n**1. Derivation of Rate Expressions**\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the total measured Aryl Sulfatase A (ARSA) activity, $v_{\\mathrm{N/N}}$, in a homozygous normal individual. This individual has two normal ARSA alleles. Each normal allele produces a molar amount of active sites equal to $e_0$. Therefore, the total concentration of active enzyme sites per mg of protein is:\n$$[E_T]_{\\mathrm{N/N}} = e_{0} + e_{0} = 2e_{0}$$\nThe enzyme produced is the normal type, with kinetic parameters $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{N}$ and $K_{M}^{N}$. Substituting these into the Michaelis-Menten equation gives the rate for a homozygous normal individual:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{N/N}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{N} [E_T]_{\\mathrm{N/N}} \\frac{[S]}{K_{M}^{N} + [S]} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{N} (2e_{0}) \\frac{[S]}{K_{M}^{N} + [S]}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the total ARSA activity, $v_{\\mathrm{P/Null}}$, in the compound heterozygote patient. This patient has one pseudodeficiency allele and one pathogenic null allele. The pseudodeficiency allele produces an amount of active sites equal to $\\alpha e_{0}$, where $\\alpha$ is a scaling factor. The pathogenic null allele produces no catalytically competent enzyme, so its contribution is $0$. The total concentration of active enzyme sites per mg of protein is:\n$$[E_T]_{\\mathrm{P/Null}} = \\alpha e_{0} + 0 = \\alpha e_{0}$$\nThe enzyme present is the pseudodeficiency variant, with kinetic parameters $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{P}$ and $K_{M}^{P}$. The rate for the compound heterozygote is therefore:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{P/Null}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{P} [E_T]_{\\mathrm{P/Null}} \\frac{[S]}{K_{M}^{P} + [S]} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}^{P} (\\alpha e_{0}) \\frac{[S]}{K_{M}^{P} + [S]}$$\n\n**2.
