            "problem": "A $4$-year-old child presents with acute atraumatic hip pain and limited range of motion. In pediatrics, the differential diagnosis includes transient synovitis of the hip and septic arthritis of the hip. The Kocher criteria are used as a clinical decision rule to stratify the probability of septic arthritis versus transient synovitis. For the purpose of this problem, define a “test positive” result as having at least two Kocher criteria present (fever, non-weight-bearing, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); sometimes C-reactive protein (CRP) is used in modified versions, but here the “test” is specified only as $\\geq 2$ Kocher criteria).\n\nAssume the following well-tested quantities for the “test positive” event in a similar population:\n- Sensitivity $Se = 0.86$, the probability the test is positive if the child has septic arthritis.\n- Specificity $Sp = 0.59$, the probability the test is negative if the child does not have septic arthritis.\n\nAssume the clinician’s pretest probability for septic arthritis in this child is $p_{0} = 0.10$. Using the foundational definitions of sensitivity and specificity together with Bayes’ theorem from probability theory, derive the posterior probability $p_{1} = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{septic arthritis} \\mid \\text{test positive})$ and then compute its numerical value for the parameters given. Express the final probability as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures. No units are needed.",

Assume conditional independence of these criteria given disease status and the following well-tested conditional probabilities (sensitivities and false-positive rates):\n- $P(\\text{Temperature} > 38.5 \\mid \\text{Septic}) = 0.70$ and $P(\\text{Temperature} > 38.5 \\mid \\text{Not septic}) = 0.20$,\n- $P(\\text{Non-weight-bearing} \\mid \\text{Septic}) = 0.85$ and $P(\\text{Non-weight-bearing} \\mid \\text{Not septic}) = 0.30$,\n- $P(\\text{ESR} \\geq 40 \\mid \\text{Septic}) = 0.80$ and $P(\\text{ESR} \\geq 40 \\mid \\text{Not septic}) = 0.25$,\n- $P(\\text{WBC} \\geq 12{,}000 \\mid \\text{Septic}) = 0.75$ and $P(\\text{WBC} \\geq 12{,}000 \\mid \\text{Not septic}) = 0.35$.\n\nThe baseline prior probability of septic arthritis in the evaluated population is $0.05$.

We will calculate a sensitivity metric, $S$, which represents the absolute change in the posterior probability of septic arthritis when we move from a simple binary classification of the temperature criterion (based on the true temperature) to a more realistic model that accounts for the thermometer's uniform measurement error.\n\nLet $D$ be the event of septic arthritis.

The thermometer adds a measurement error $\\epsilon \\sim U[-0.5, 0.5]$. The measured temperature is $T_{\\text{meas}} = 38.3 + \\epsilon$.
