The solution must be derived by methodically applying these definitions to the provided data.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n- **Patient Profile**: Age $12$ years; history of recurrent wheeze with viral illnesses and exertional shortness of breath; no chronic neuromuscular disease or chest wall abnormalities.\n- **Spirometry Quality Assurance**: Conducted per American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards. Quality metrics met: $\\geq 3$ acceptable maneuvers, best two forced expiratory volume in 1 second ($FEV_1$) values within $100\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, back-extrapolated volume $< 5\\%$ of forced vital capacity ($FVC$) and $< 150\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, and forced expiratory time ($FET$) of $4.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- **Reference Standards**: Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) equations.\n- **Definition of Abnormality**: Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) is defined as a $z$-score $< -1.645$.\n- **Pre-Bronchodilator Data**:\n    - $FEV_1 = 1.65\\,\\mathrm{L}$ (predicted $2.42\\,\\mathrm{L}$, $z = -2.1$)\n    - $FVC = 2.50\\,\\mathrm{L}$ (predicted $2.60\\,\\mathrm{L}$, $z = -0.3$)\n    - $FEV_1/FVC = 0.66$ (LLN for ratio $= 0.80$, ratio $z = -2.5$)\n    - Mid-expiratory flow ($FEF_{25-75}$) $= 35\\%$ predicted.\n- **Post-Bronchodilator Data**: (after $400\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}$ albuterol)\n    - $FEV_1 = 1.90\\,\\mathrm{L}$ (change $= +0.25\\,\\mathrm{L}$, percent change $= +15\\%$)\n    - $FVC = 2.53\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n    - $FEV_1/FVC = 0.75$\n- **Provided Definitions**:\n    - **Obstructive defect**: reduced $FEV_1/FVC$ below LLN.\n    - **Restrictive defect**: reduced $FVC$ below LLN with normal or elevated $FEV_1/FVC$, requiring confirmation by reduced Total Lung Capacity ($TLC$).\n    - **Mixed pattern**: presence of both an obstructive defect and a reduced $FVC$ below LLN (and reduced $TLC$).\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Problem Statement**\nThe problem statement provides a coherent and self-contained clinical scenario. The data are quantitative and consistent with established medical and physiological principles. The definitions for interpreting the data are explicitly provided and align with standard pulmonology practice. The topic is directly relevant to the diagnosis of pediatric asthma as specified. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no apparent flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe interpretation of the spirometry results must proceed in a structured manner, beginning with the baseline (pre-bronchodilator) data to classify the ventilatory pattern, followed by an analysis of the post-bronchodilator data to assess for reversibility.\n\n**1. Analysis of Pre-Bronchodilator Spirometry and Pattern Classification**\n\nWe will evaluate the primary parameters against the LLN, defined as a $z$-score less than $-1.645$.\n\n-   **$FEV_1/FVC$ Ratio**: The patient's ratio is $0.66$. The LLN for the ratio is explicitly given as $0.80$, and the patient's $z$-score for the ratio is $-2.5$. Both the absolute value ($0.66 < 0.80$) and the z-score ($-2.5 < -1.645$) confirm that the $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio is below the lower limit of normal. According to the provided definition (\"An obstructive ventilatory defect is characterized by a reduced $FEV_1/FVC$ below LLN\"), the patient has an obstructive ventilatory defect.\n\n-   **Forced Vital Capacity ($FVC$)**: The patient's $FVC$ is $2.50\\,\\mathrm{L}$, with a corresponding $z$-score of $-0.3$. Since $-0.3$ is not less than $-1.645$, the $FVC$ is within the normal range.\n\n-   **Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second ($FEV_1$)**: The patient's $FEV_1$ is $1.65\\,\\mathrm{L}$, with a corresponding $z$-score of $-2.1$. Since $-2.1 < -1.645$, the $FEV_1$ is below the lower limit of normal. This reduction is expected in an obstructive defect, as airflow is limited.\n\n-   **Classification**:\n    -   Is it **obstructive**? Yes, because the primary criterion ($FEV_1/FVC < \\text{LLN}$) is met.\n    -   Is it **restrictive**? No. The provided definition for a restrictive defect requires a \"reduced $FVC$ below LLN\". The patient's $FVC$ is normal ($z = -0.3$).\n    -   Is it **mixed**? No. A mixed pattern requires the simultaneous presence of both obstruction and restriction. Since the spirometric criterion for restriction (low $FVC$) is not met, a mixed pattern is not present.\n\nTherefore, the pre-bronchodilator spirometry demonstrates an isolated obstructive ventilatory defect.\n\n**2. Analysis of Bronchodilator Response**\n\nWe assess the change in $FEV_1$ after the administration of albuterol, a bronchodilator.\n\n-   Baseline $FEV_1 = 1.65\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n-   Post-bronchodilator $FEV_1 = 1.90\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n-   The absolute change is $1.90\\,\\mathrm{L} - 1.65\\,\\mathrm{L} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n-   The percentage change from baseline is calculated as:\n    $$ \\text{Percent Change} = \\frac{\\text{Post-BD } FEV_1 - \\text{Pre-BD } FEV_1}{\\text{Pre-BD } FEV_1} \\times 100\\% $$\n    $$ \\text{Percent Change} = \\frac{1.90 - 1.65}{1.65} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{0.25}{1.65} \\times 100\\% \\approx 15.15\\% $$\nThis confirms the problem's statement of a $+15\\%$ change. A significant bronchodilator response, indicative of reversible airflow obstruction, is conventionally defined in pediatric and adult guidelines as an increase in $FEV_1$ of $\\geq 12\\%$ from the baseline value. Since $15\\% \\geq 12\\%$, the patient demonstrates a significant bronchodilator response.\n\n**3. Synthesis and Final Interpretation**\n\nThe patient is a $12$-year-old with a clinical history highly suggestive of asthma (recurrent wheeze, exertional symptoms). The spirometry confirms this suspicion by demonstrating the hallmark features of asthma: an obstructive ventilatory pattern that shows significant reversibility upon administration of a bronchodilator. The quality metrics provided assure us that the test is valid and the results are interpretable.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Obstructive ventilatory defect consistent with asthma, with a significant bronchodilator response; not mixed because $FVC$ is within LLN, and restriction would require reduced $FVC$ and reduced $TLC$.**\n-   **Obstructive ventilatory defect**: Correct, as the $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio is below the LLN.\n-   **Consistent with asthma**: Correct, given the reversible obstruction in the context of the clinical history.\n-   **Significant bronchodilator response**: Correct, as the $FEV_1$ increased by $15\\%$, which is $\\geq 12\\%$.\n-   **Not mixed because $FVC$ is within LLN**: Correct. The patient's $FVC$ z-score is $-0.3$, well above the threshold for abnormality ($z < -1.645$).\n-   **Restriction would require reduced $FVC$ and reduced $TLC$**: Correct, this restates the standard definition provided in the problem.\nThis option provides a complete and accurate summary of the findings.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Mixed obstructive–restrictive ventilatory defect because both $FEV_1$ and $FEV_1/FVC$ are low; the normal $FVC$ does not exclude restriction.**\n-   **Mixed obstructive–restrictive ventilatory defect**: Incorrect. As per the provided definitions which must be used for this problem, a mixed pattern requires a \"reduced $FVC$ below LLN\". The patient's $FVC$ is normal. The assertion that a normal $FVC$ doesn't exclude restriction is true in a broader sense (as gold-standard diagnosis requires $TLC$ measurement), but for the purpose of interpreting this spirometry report based on the given rules, the absence of a low $FVC$ precludes a spirometric diagnosis of restriction or a mixed pattern.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Isolated restrictive ventilatory defect because $FEV_1$ is reduced; the low $FEV_1/FVC$ is expected in restriction.**\n-   **Isolated restrictive ventilatory defect**: Incorrect. The primary identifier of an obstructive, not restrictive, defect is the low $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio.\n-   **the low $FEV_1/FVC$ is expected in restriction**: This is a fundamentally incorrect statement. In a pure restrictive pattern, volume is lost but airflow mechanics are preserved, leading to a normal or even elevated $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Normal spirometry due to submaximal effort; interpretation should be deferred until repeat testing, as bronchodilator response is not significant.**\n-   **Normal spirometry**: Incorrect. The $FEV_1$, $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio, and $FEF_{25-75}$ are all significantly reduced.\n-   **due to submaximal effort**: This contradicts the problem statement that the \"spirometry is performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) standards with the following quality metrics...\". We must accept the test as valid.\n-   **bronchodilator response is not significant**: Incorrect. The $15\\%$ increase in $FEV_1$ exceeds the $12\\%$ threshold for significance.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

General Eligibility for Biologic Therapy**\n\nThe first criterion states that \"biologic therapy for asthma is reserved for severe asthma that remains uncontrolled despite optimized high-dose controller therapy.\"\n*   The patient is on high-dose ICS-LABA, which constitutes high-dose controller therapy.\n*   The asthma is uncontrolled, as evidenced by persistent symptoms and a significant exacerbation history ($3$ steroid bursts and $1$ emergency department visit in the past $12$ months).\n*   Adherence and inhaler technique have been addressed and optimized, ruling out these common contributors to poor asthma control.\nTherefore, the patient is a candidate for add-on biologic therapy.\n\n**2. Eligibility for Omalizumab (Anti-IgE Therapy)**\n\nThe second criterion states that anti-IgE therapy requires \"allergic sensitization and a baseline total IgE within the dosing table range for age and weight.\"\n*   **Allergic Sensitization**: The patient has confirmed sensitization to perennial allergens (dust mite and cat) via skin-prick testing and specific IgE. This criterion is met.\n*   **Age and Indication**: Omalizumab is approved for use in patients aged $6$ years and older with moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma. The patient is $10$ years old and has severe persistent asthma with an allergic component. This is consistent with the indication.\n*   **IgE and Weight Range**: Omalizumab dosing is determined by a matrix of baseline total serum IgE and body weight. For pediatric patients (age $\\ge 6$ years), the approved IgE range is typically $30-700$ IU/mL. The patient's weight is $30$ kg and total IgE is $200$ IU/mL. This combination of weight and IgE falls squarely within standard published dosing tables for omalizumab. This criterion is met.\n\nBased on this analysis, the patient is currently eligible for omalizumab.\n\n**3. Eligibility for Mepolizumab (Anti–interleukin-5 Therapy)**\n\nThe third criterion states that anti-IL-5 therapy requires \"an eosinophilic phenotype with blood eosinophils above a validated threshold and a history of exacerbations despite high-dose therapy.\"\n*   **History of Exacerbations**: The patient has a clear history of frequent and severe exacerbations, as noted previously. This criterion is met.\n*   **Age and Indication**: Mepolizumab is approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma aged $6$ years and older. The patient is $10$ years old. This is consistent with the indication.\n*   **Eosinophilic Phenotype**: This is defined by a blood eosinophil count above a certain threshold. For mepolizumab, the threshold in clinical trials and labeling is typically a baseline count of $\\ge 150$ cells/$\\mu$L at initiation, or a history of a count $\\ge 300$ cells/$\\mu$L within the past $12$ months. The patient's absolute blood eosinophil count is $400$ cells/$\\mu$L, measured under appropriate conditions (off systemic steroids). This value is significantly above both thresholds. This criterion is met.\n\nBased on this analysis, the patient is currently eligible for mepolizumab.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe patient's clinical and laboratory profile fulfills the fundamental eligibility criteria for both omalizumab (based on age, allergic sensitization, and IgE/weight) and mepolizumab (based on age, eosinophil count, and exacerbation history). The elevated FeNO of $45$ ppb further supports a Type 2 inflammatory phenotype, which is the underlying pathophysiology targeted by both of these biologic agents.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Eligible for both omalizumab and mepolizumab now**: This statement is consistent with the derivation above. The patient meets the established criteria for both therapeutic agents. This option is **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Eligible for omalizumab only**: This statement is incorrect. While the patient is eligible for omalizumab, the derivation also demonstrates clear eligibility for mepolizumab based on the eosinophilic phenotype and exacerbation history. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Eligible for mepolizumab only**: This statement is incorrect. While the patient is eligible for mepolizumab, the derivation also demonstrates clear eligibility for omalizumab based on the allergic phenotype and IgE level. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Not eligible for either biologic now**: This statement is incorrect. The patient is a classic candidate for biologic therapy and meets the specific criteria for initiation of two distinct agents, omalizumab and mepolizumab. This option is **Incorrect**.",
