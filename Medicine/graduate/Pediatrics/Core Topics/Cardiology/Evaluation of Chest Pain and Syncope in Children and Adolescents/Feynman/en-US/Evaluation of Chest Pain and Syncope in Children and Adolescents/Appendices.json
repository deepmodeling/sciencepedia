            "introduction": "The evaluation of syncope requires vigilant screening for life-threatening conditions, and interpreting the QT interval is a critical step. Because the QT interval naturally varies with heart rate, calculating the heart-rate corrected QT interval, or $QT_c$, is essential for identifying patients at risk for inherited channelopathies like Long QT Syndrome. This exercise provides hands-on practice in applying the widely used Bazett's formula to raw electrocardiogram (ECG) data, a fundamental skill for any clinician evaluating syncope .",

            "problem": "A 15-year-old presents with exertional syncope and intermittent non-exertional chest pain. A standard Electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a measured ventricular repolarization interval $\\mathrm{QT} = 400$ ms and a cycle length $\\mathrm{RR} = 0.80$ s at the time of recording. Begin from the foundational facts that the QT interval reflects ventricular depolarization and repolarization time and that it varies with heart rate, which is inversely related to the RR interval. Under the widely used Bazett heart-rate correction approach, which assumes an empiric power-law dependence between $\\mathrm{QT}$ and $\\mathrm{RR}$, derive the corrected QT interval $\\mathrm{QTc}$, compute its value for the provided measurements, and determine whether the $\\mathrm{QTc}$ lies in the normal or borderline range for adolescents. For classification, use the following well-tested pediatric bounds: normal if $\\mathrm{QTc} < 440$ ms, borderline if $440$ ms $\\le \\mathrm{QTc} \\le 460$ ms, prolonged if $\\mathrm{QTc} > 460$ ms. Round your final numerical value for $\\mathrm{QTc}$ to three significant figures and express the result in milliseconds (ms). The final answer must be the single numerical value of $\\mathrm{QTc}$ as specified.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of electrocardiography and clinical cardiology. All necessary data ($\\mathrm{QT}$ interval, $\\mathrm{RR}$ interval), the specific correction formula to be used (Bazett's), and the classification criteria are provided. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. The values are physiologically realistic for a 15-year-old.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the heart-rate corrected QT interval ($\\mathrm{QTc}$) from a measured QT interval and the corresponding cardiac cycle length ($\\mathrm{RR}$ interval). The QT interval on an electrocardiogram represents the time for both ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Its duration is physiologically dependent on the heart rate: it shortens at faster heart rates (shorter $\\mathrm{RR}$ intervals) and lengthens at slower heart rates (longer $\\mathrm{RR}$ intervals). To compare QT intervals across different heart rates, a corrected value, $\\mathrm{QTc}$, is calculated.\n\nThe problem specifies using the Bazett correction formula. This formula is based on the empirical observation that the QT interval is approximately proportional to the square root of the $\\mathrm{RR}$ interval. This can be expressed as a power-law relationship:\n$$ \\mathrm{QT} \\approx k \\cdot (\\mathrm{RR})^{1/2} $$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. The corrected QT interval, $\\mathrm{QTc}$, is defined as this constant $k$, which effectively normalizes the QT interval to what it would be at a standard heart rate where the $\\mathrm{RR}$ interval is $1$ second. Rearranging the relationship to solve for $k$ gives the formula for $\\mathrm{QTc}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{QTc} = \\frac{\\mathrm{QT}}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{RR}}} $$\nFor this formula to be dimensionally consistent, it is standard practice to express both $\\mathrm{QT}$ and $\\mathrm{RR}$ in seconds, which yields a $\\mathrm{QTc}$ in units of $\\text{s}^{1/2}$, an unconventional unit. A more rigorous interpretation, which avoids this issue and is implicitly used in clinical practice, is to normalize the $\\mathrm{RR}$ interval by a reference interval of $1$ second. This makes the denominator dimensionless.\n$$ \\mathrm{QTc} = \\frac{\\mathrm{QT}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathrm{RR}}{1 \\text{ s}}}} $$\nUsing this form, the units of $\\mathrm{QTc}$ are the same as the units of the measured $\\mathrm{QT}$.\n\nThe givens from the problem are:\n- Measured QT interval: $\\mathrm{QT} = 400 \\text{ ms}$\n- Measured RR interval (cycle length): $\\mathrm{RR} = 0.80 \\text{ s}$\n\nWe will use the dimensionally consistent form of the formula, substituting the given values directly. The problem asks for the result in milliseconds, so we use the $\\mathrm{QT}$ value in milliseconds.\n$$ \\mathrm{QTc} = \\frac{400 \\text{ ms}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{0.80 \\text{ s}}{1 \\text{ s}}}} = \\frac{400}{\\sqrt{0.80}} \\text{ ms} $$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$ \\sqrt{0.80} \\approx 0.89442719... $$\n$$ \\mathrm{QTc} = \\frac{400}{0.89442719...} \\text{ ms} \\approx 447.213595... \\text{ ms} $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final numerical value to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $4$, $4$, and $7$. The fourth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$ \\mathrm{QTc} \\approx 447 \\text{ ms} $$\n\nFinally, we determine whether this value lies in the normal, borderline, or prolonged range for adolescents using the provided criteria:\n- Normal: $\\mathrm{QTc} < 440 \\text{ ms}$\n- Borderline: $440 \\text{ ms} \\le \\mathrm{QTc} \\le 460 \\text{ ms}$\n- Prolonged: $\\mathrm{QTc} > 460 \\text{ ms}$\n\nOur calculated value is $\\mathrm{QTc} = 447 \\text{ ms}$. Since $440 \\le 447 \\le 460$, the corrected QT interval is in the **borderline** range. This finding, in the context of exertional syncope, would warrant further clinical investigation for conditions such as Long QT Syndrome. The final numerical answer required is the value of $\\mathrm{QTc}$.",

The definition of POTS, the threshold heart rate increase for adolescents ($\\geq 40$ bpm), and the definition of the absence of orthostatic hypotension are consistent with current medical guidelines published by major cardiology and pediatric societies. The provided heart rate values ($75$ bpm supine, $120$ bpm standing) are physiologically plausible in this clinical context. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical values and clear, unambiguous definitions to compute the requested quantity, $M$. The existence of a unique, stable, and meaningful solution is guaranteed.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is clinical and precise, free from subjectivity or bias.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all data ($HR_{\\text{supine}}$, $HR_{\\text{stand}}$, $\\theta$) and definitions ($\\Delta HR$, $M$) required for the calculation. There are no contradictions. The patient's age ($16$ years) correctly places them in the adolescent category for which the threshold $\\theta = 40$ bpm is specified. The condition of no orthostatic hypotension is explicitly stated, satisfying a key part of the POTS diagnostic criteria.\n5.  **Conclusion**: The problem statement is valid. It is a straightforward application of defined clinical criteria to a given set of data.\n\n### Step 3: Solution\nThe objective is to compute the diagnostic margin, $M$, defined by the equation:\n$$M = \\Delta HR - \\theta$$\nThe components of this equation, $\\Delta HR$ and $\\theta$, must be determined from the problem statement.\n\nFirst, the threshold heart rate increase, $\\theta$, is given for adolescents as:\n$$\\theta = 40 \\text{ bpm}$$\n\nNext, the change in heart rate, $\\Delta HR$, is defined as the difference between the average standing heart rate ($HR_{\\text{stand}}$) and the average supine heart rate ($HR_{\\text{supine}}$).\n$$\\Delta HR = HR_{\\text{stand}} - HR_{\\text{supine}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the necessary values:\n$$HR_{\\text{stand}} = 120 \\text{ bpm}$$\n$$HR_{\\text{supine}} = 75 \\text{ bpm}$$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\Delta HR$:\n$$\\Delta HR = 120 - 75 = 45 \\text{ bpm}$$\n\nThis result, $\\Delta HR = 45$ bpm, represents the sustained heart rate increase upon standing. This value exceeds the diagnostic threshold $\\theta = 40$ bpm. Since the problem also states there is no orthostatic hypotension, the patient meets the criteria for a POTS diagnosis.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the diagnostic margin, $M$, by substituting the values of $\\Delta HR$ and $\\theta$ into its defining formula:\n$$M = \\Delta HR - \\theta$$\n$$M = 45 - 40$$\n$$M = 5 \\text{ bpm}$$\n\nThe diagnostic margin $M = 5$ bpm quantifies by how much the patient's heart rate increase surpasses the minimum threshold required for the POTS diagnosis.",

            "problem": "A $15$-year-old adolescent with orthostatic intolerance (OI) characterized by lightheadedness and tachycardia upon standing is advised on non-pharmacologic management. The pathophysiologic basis is that upright posture induces a gravitational shift of blood to the lower extremities, decreasing venous return to the heart. By the Frank–Starling relationship, stroke volume depends on end-diastolic volume, so reduced preload lowers stroke volume and increases heart rate through baroreflex-mediated compensation to preserve cardiac output, where cardiac output ($CO$) satisfies $CO = HR \\times SV$ and mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) satisfies $MAP = CO \\times SVR$, with $SVR$ denoting systemic vascular resistance.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of cardiovascular physiology, specifically the mechanisms underlying orthostatic intolerance and its management through volume expansion. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution. The calculations required are based on dimensional analysis and conservation of volume.\n\nThe objective is to compute two quantities: the total daily fluid intake target in liters and the corresponding number of standard water bottles required to meet this target.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Weight of the adolescent, $W = 50 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Recommended daily fluid intake rate per unit mass, $R = 60 \\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$.\n- Capacity of a standard water bottle, $V_{\\mathrm{bottle}} = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{L}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total daily fluid target, denoted as $V_{\\mathrm{total}}$.
