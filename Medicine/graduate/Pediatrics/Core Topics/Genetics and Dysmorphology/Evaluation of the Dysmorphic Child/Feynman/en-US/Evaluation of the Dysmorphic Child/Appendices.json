            "introduction": "The evaluation of a dysmorphic child begins with objective and quantitative characterization of physical features. The $z$-score is a fundamental statistical tool that translates a raw measurement into a standardized value, indicating how many standard deviations it lies from the population mean. This practice  will guide you through calculating a $z$-score for a critical neonatal measurement—the occipitofrontal circumference—to objectively classify head size and diagnose conditions such as microcephaly.",

            "problem": "A term neonate at $40$ weeks of gestation is referred for evaluation of dysmorphic features. The occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) is measured at $24$ hours of life as $31.5$ centimeters. Published normative data for OFC at $40$ weeks indicate a population mean of $34.5$ centimeters and a population standard deviation of $1.5$ centimeters. Anthropometric measurements such as OFC in a well-defined population are widely observed to approximate a normal distribution under stable measurement conditions and appropriate standardization.\n\nUsing the standard statistical approach to assess deviation from the normative population mean for a normally distributed anthropometric variable, determine the standardized deviation of this infant’s OFC and use established pediatric thresholds to classify whether the infant has microcephaly and whether it meets criteria for severe microcephaly. Report the standardized deviation as a dimensionless $z$-score and round your final numeric answer to four significant figures. The final numeric answer must be the $z$-score only; do not include any units in the final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is first assessed for validity. All provided data—the individual occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) measurement ($x$), the population mean OFC ($\\mu$), and the population standard deviation ($\\sigma$)—are supplied. The premise that anthropometric measurements like OFC in a defined population approximate a normal distribution is a standard and scientifically accepted assumption in biostatistics and clinical medicine. The given values for mean and standard deviation are consistent with established pediatric growth standards. The question is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the standardized deviation, commonly known as the $z$-score, for the neonate's OFC. The $z$-score measures how many standard deviations an observation or data point is from the mean of a distribution. The formula for the $z$-score is:\n$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nwhere $x$ is the individual measurement, $\\mu$ is the population mean, and $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.\n\nThe problem provides the following values for a term neonate at $40$ weeks of gestation:\n- The measured OFC of the infant, $x = 31.5$ centimeters.\n- The population mean OFC, $\\mu = 34.5$ centimeters.\n- The population standard deviation of the OFC, $\\sigma = 1.5$ centimeters.\n\nSubstituting these values into the $z$-score formula:\n$$z = \\frac{31.5 - 34.5}{1.5}$$\nThe numerator represents the deviation of the measurement from the mean:\n$$31.5 - 34.5 = -3.0$$\nThis deviation is then divided by the standard deviation to express it in standardized units:\n$$z = \\frac{-3.0}{1.5} = -2.0$$\nThe calculated $z$-score is precisely $-2.0$. The problem specifies that the final answer should be rounded to four significant figures. To express $-2.0$ with four significant figures, we write it as $-2.000$.\n\nThe secondary part of the task is to classify the finding based on established pediatric thresholds for microcephaly. These thresholds are defined using standard deviations from the mean:\n- **Microcephaly:** Defined as an OFC more than $2$ standard deviations below the mean for age and sex. This corresponds to a $z$-score of $z < -2.0$.\n- **Severe Microcephaly:** Defined as an OFC more than $3$ standard deviations below the mean for age and sex. This corresponds to a $z$-score of $z < -3.0$.\n\nThe calculated $z$-score for this infant is exactly $-2.000$. Based on the standard, strict inequality definition ($z < -2.0$), the infant's OFC is at the threshold for microcephaly but does not fall below it. Therefore, the infant does not formally meet the diagnostic criterion for microcephaly. However, in any clinical context, a value at this cutoff is considered borderline and highly significant, necessitating further evaluation for underlying causes. The infant's OFC is not more than $3$ standard deviations below the mean, so the criterion for severe microcephaly ($z < -3.0$) is not met.\n\nThe final numeric answer requested is the $z$-score itself, rounded to four significant figures.",

            "introduction": "Clinical dysmorphology often requires distinguishing between similar-appearing features that have different underlying developmental origins and clinical implications. This exercise  moves beyond single measurements to demonstrate how comparing $z$-scores for related anthropometric data, such as inner canthal and interpupillary distances, provides a quantitative basis for differential diagnosis. By applying this method, you will learn to systematically differentiate between isolated telecanthus and true orbital hypertelorism, a key skill in craniofacial assessment.",

            "problem": "A clinician is evaluating a $6$-year-old child with suspected orbital spacing anomaly as part of the assessment of a dysmorphic phenotype. Two linear facial measurements are obtained using a rigid ruler: inner canthal distance (ICD) and interpupillary distance (IPD). For the child, the measured inner canthal distance is $36$ mm and the measured interpupillary distance is $55$ mm. For $6$-year-old children from an age- and sex-matched reference population, the normative mean and standard deviation (SD) for inner canthal distance are $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ICD}} = 30$ mm and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ICD}} = 2$ mm, and the normative mean and standard deviation for interpupillary distance are $\\mu_{\\mathrm{IPD}} = 55$ mm and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{IPD}} = 3$ mm.\n\nUse the definition of a $z$-score, $z = \\dfrac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, where $x$ is the observed measurement, $\\mu$ is the population mean, and $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation. In clinical dysmorphology, an abnormally increased linear anthropometric measurement is commonly defined as one with $z \\ge 2$. Telecanthus refers to increased soft-tissue medial canthal separation with a normal bony orbital distance, while hypertelorism refers to a true increase in the bony interorbital distance often reflected in increases in both soft-tissue and bony surrogates.\n\nTo encode the classification numerically in a way that distinguishes these patterns, define the binary-encoded classification index\n$$\nC \\;=\\; \\mathbb{1}\\!\\left(z_{\\mathrm{ICD}} \\ge 2\\right)\\cdot 2^{0} \\;+\\; \\mathbb{1}\\!\\left(z_{\\mathrm{IPD}} \\ge 2\\right)\\cdot 2^{1},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{1}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function that equals $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise, $z_{\\mathrm{ICD}}$ is the $z$-score for the inner canthal distance, and $z_{\\mathrm{IPD}}$ is the $z$-score for the interpupillary distance. Under this encoding, $C=0$ indicates neither measurement is abnormally increased, $C=1$ indicates increased inner canthal distance only (consistent with telecanthus), $C=2$ indicates increased interpupillary distance only, and $C=3$ indicates both are increased (consistent with hypertelorism).\n\nCompute $C$ for this child using the data above. No rounding is required. Report $C$ as a single integer without units.",
            "solution": "The task requires translating measured facial distances into standardized deviations from age-matched population means using the $z$-score definition and then using a binary-encoded rule to produce a single numeric classification index.\n\nThe foundational pieces are:\n- The $z$-score definition from statistics: for any measurement $x$ with population mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$, the standardized score is $z = \\dfrac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$.\n- The clinical dysmorphology convention that an abnormally increased linear anthropometric measurement is defined by $z \\ge 2$.\n- The indicator function $\\mathbb{1}(\\cdot)$, which maps a logical condition to $1$ if true and $0$ if false.\n- The encoding $C = \\mathbb{1}(z_{\\mathrm{ICD}} \\ge 2)\\cdot 2^{0} + \\mathbb{1}(z_{\\mathrm{IPD}} \\ge 2)\\cdot 2^{1}$.\n\nFirst, compute the $z$-scores.\n\nFor inner canthal distance (ICD), the observed measurement is $x_{\\mathrm{ICD}} = 36$ mm, and the normative parameters are $\\mu_{\\mathrm{ICD}} = 30$ mm and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ICD}} = 2$ mm.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Bayesian inference as applied to medical genetics, specifically the interpretation of genetic variants using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) framework. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary data and assumptions (independence of evidence) to compute a single, unique solution.\n\nThe core of this problem is the application of Bayes' theorem, which updates a prior belief (pre-test probability) in light of new evidence to yield a posterior probability. A convenient form of Bayes' theorem uses odds and likelihood ratios.\n\nLet $P$ be the hypothesis that the variant is pathogenic, and $E$ be the observed evidence from the clinical exome sequencing and ACMG classification. The pre-test odds in favor of pathogenicity are given as $1:9$. This can be written as:\n$$\nOdds_{pre}(P) = \\frac{\\text{P(variant is pathogenic)}}{\\text{P(variant is not pathogenic)}} = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\nThe evidence consists of two independent findings, each with an associated Likelihood Ratio ($LR$). The Likelihood Ratio is defined as:\n$$\nLR = \\frac{P(E|P)}{P(E|\\neg P)}\n$$\nwhere $P(E|P)$ is the probability of observing the evidence if the variant is truly pathogenic, and $P(E|\\neg P)$ is the probability of observing the evidence if the variant is not pathogenic.\n\nThe problem provides two likelihood ratios corresponding to two independent pieces of evidence:\n$1$. A strong evidence code, with $LR_1 = 18.7$.\n$2$. A supporting evidence code, with $LR_2 = 2.08$.\n\nSince the evidentiary items are stated to be independent, the total likelihood ratio, $LR_{total}$, for the combined evidence is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR_{total} = LR_1 \\times LR_2\n$$\nThe Bayesian update rule in odds form is:\n$$\n\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pre-test Odds} \\times \\text{Total Likelihood Ratio}\n$$\nOr, in our notation:\n$$\nOdds_{post}(P) = Odds_{pre}(P) \\times LR_{total}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the total likelihood ratio:\n$$\nLR_{total} = 18.7 \\times 2.08 = 38.896\n$$\nNext, we compute the posterior odds of pathogenicity:\n$$\nOdds_{post}(P) = \\frac{1}{9} \\times 38.896 = \\frac{38.896}{9}\n$$\nThe final step is to convert these posterior odds into a posterior probability. The relationship between probability $p$ and odds $O$ is given by the formula $p = \\frac{O}{1+O}$. Therefore, the posterior probability of pathogenicity, $P_{post}(P)$, is:\n$$\nP_{post}(P) = \\frac{Odds_{post}(P)}{1 + Odds_{post}(P)}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for the posterior odds:\n$$\nP_{post}(P) = \\frac{\\frac{38.896}{9}}{1 + \\frac{38.896}{9}} = \\frac{\\frac{38.896}{9}}{\\frac{9 + 38.896}{9}} = \\frac{38.896}{9 + 38.896} = \\frac{38.896}{47.896}\n$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$\nP_{post}(P) \\approx 0.81208639...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final probability to be expressed as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nP_{post}(P) \\approx 0.8121\n$$\nThus, the posterior probability that the variant is pathogenic, given the evidence, is approximately $0.8121$.",
