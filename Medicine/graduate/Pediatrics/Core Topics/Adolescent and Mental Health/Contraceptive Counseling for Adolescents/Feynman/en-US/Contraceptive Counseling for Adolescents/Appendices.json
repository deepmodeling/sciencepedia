            "problem": "A pediatric adolescent clinic is evaluating the potential impact of encouraging adolescents currently using combined oral contraceptive pills to switch to Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC). Under typical use in this population, the one-year pregnancy probability for adolescents using pills is $0.07$, and for adolescents using LARC is $0.002$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Number Needed to Switch (NNS) and its calculation based on provided probability data. The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   The one-year pregnancy probability for adolescents using combined oral contraceptive pills is $p_{pills} = 0.07$.\n-   The one-year pregnancy probability for adolescents using Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) is $p_{LARC} = 0.002$.\n-   These probabilities represent independent Bernoulli risks per adolescent-year.\n-   The Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is defined as the difference in risks between two strategies.\n-   The expected number of events prevented is the product of cohort size and ARR.\n-   The Number Needed to Switch (NNS) is defined as the expected number of adolescents who need to switch from pills to LARC to avert one pregnancy over a one-year horizon.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard epidemiological and biostatistical principles (risk, absolute risk reduction, Number Needed to Treat/Switch). The provided probabilities for contraceptive failure are consistent with published typical-use rates. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. The language is precise and devoid of ambiguity or subjectivity. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A formal solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\nLet $p_{pills}$ be the probability of pregnancy over one year for an individual using pills, and $p_{LARC}$ be the probability of pregnancy over one year for an individual using LARC. The problem provides these values as:\n$$ p_{pills} = 0.07 $$\n$$ p_{LARC} = 0.002 $$\n\nThe problem defines the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) as the difference in risks. The risk in this context is the probability of pregnancy. The intervention is switching from the higher-risk method (pills) to the lower-risk method (LARC). Therefore, the ARR is:\n$$ ARR = p_{pills} - p_{LARC} $$\n\nConsider a cohort of $N$ adolescents who switch from pills to LARC. Based on the assumption of independent Bernoulli risks, the expected number of pregnancies in this cohort if they had all remained on pills would be:\n$$ E_{pills} = N \\cdot p_{pills} $$\nThe expected number of pregnancies after they have all switched to LARC is:\n$$ E_{LARC} = N \\cdot p_{LARC} $$\n\nThe expected number of pregnancies averted (prevented), $E_{averted}$, by this switch is the difference between these two expected values:\n$$ E_{averted} = E_{pills} - E_{LARC} = N \\cdot p_{pills} - N \\cdot p_{LARC} $$\nFactoring out $N$, we get:\n$$ E_{averted} = N \\cdot (p_{pills} - p_{LARC}) = N \\cdot ARR $$\nThis confirms the relationship provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe Number Needed to Switch (NNS) is defined as the expected number of individuals who must switch to avert one pregnancy. This corresponds to finding the value of the cohort size, $N$, for which the expected number of averted pregnancies is exactly one. We set $N = NNS$ and $E_{averted} = 1$:\n$$ 1 = NNS \\cdot ARR $$\n\nSolving for NNS, we derive the general formula:\n$$ NNS = \\frac{1}{ARR} $$\nSubstituting the expression for ARR, we obtain the specific formula in terms of the given probabilities:\n$$ NNS = \\frac{1}{p_{pills} - p_{LARC}} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of NNS using the given data. First, calculate the ARR:\n$$ ARR = 0.07 - 0.002 = 0.068 $$\n\nNext, we calculate NNS using its derived formula:\n$$ NNS = \\frac{1}{0.068} $$\n\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we convert the decimal to a fraction:\n$$ 0.068 = \\frac{68}{1000} $$\nTherefore:\n$$ NNS = \\frac{1}{\\frac{68}{1000}} = \\frac{1000}{68} $$\nTo simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. Both $1000$ and $68$ are divisible by $4$.\n$$ NNS = \\frac{1000 \\div 4}{68 \\div 4} = \\frac{250}{17} $$\nSince $17$ is a prime number and does not divide $250$, this fraction is in its simplest form. The NNS is approximately $14.7$, which means that for every $15$ adolescents (rounding to the nearest whole person) who switch from pills to LARC, one pregnancy is expected to be averted over a one-year period. However, the problem requires an exact fraction.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity prior to any attempt at a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Prior probability of pregnancy: $p = P(\\text{pregnant}) = 0.2$\n- Test performed $10$ days after intercourse.\n- Test sensitivity: $P(\\text{positive} \\mid \\text{pregnant}) = 0.95$\n- Test specificity: $P(\\text{negative} \\mid \\text{not pregnant}) = 0.99$\n- Observed event: The test result is negative.\n- Required calculation: The posterior probability that the adolescent is pregnant given a negative test, $P(\\text{pregnant} \\mid \\text{negative})$.\n- Required format: Final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing standard principles of Bayesian inference as applied to medical diagnostics. The scenario is realistic within the context of adolescent medicine and contraceptive counseling. The provided numerical values for prior probability, sensitivity, and specificity are plausible for the described clinical situation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution via a standard mathematical procedure. The language is objective and free of ambiguity. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Posterior Probability\nLet $A$ be the event that the adolescent is pregnant, and let $A^c$ be the complementary event that the adolescent is not pregnant. Let $T^-$ be the event that the urine hCG test result is negative, and let $T^+$ be the event that the test result is positive.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities:\n1.  The prior probability of pregnancy: $P(A) = 0.2$.\n2.  The probability of not being pregnant is therefore: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\n3.  The sensitivity of the test, defined as the probability of a positive result given pregnancy: $P(T^+ \\mid A) = 0.95$.\n4.  The specificity of the test, defined as the probability of a negative result given no pregnancy: $P(T^- \\mid A^c) = 0.99$.\n\nWe are asked to find the posterior probability of pregnancy given a negative test result, which is denoted by $P(A \\mid T^-)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes’ theorem, this posterior probability is given by:\n$$\nP(A \\mid T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- \\mid A) P(A)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\n\nTo utilize this formula, we must first determine the two terms in the numerator, $P(T^- \\mid A)$ and $P(A)$, and the term in the denominator, $P(T^-)$.\n\nThe term $P(A)$ is given as $0.2$.\n\nThe term $P(T^- \\mid A)$ is the probability of a negative test result given that the person is pregnant. This is the false negative rate. Since a test result can only be positive or negative, this probability is the complement of the sensitivity:\n$$\nP(T^- \\mid A) = 1 - P(T^+ \\mid A) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05\n$$\n\nThe term $P(T^-)$ is the total or marginal probability of obtaining a negative test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the two possible states (pregnant or not pregnant):\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^- \\mid A) P(A) + P(T^- \\mid A^c) P(A^c)\n$$\nWe have all the necessary components for this expression:\n- $P(T^- \\mid A) = 0.05$\n- $P(A) = 0.2$\n- $P(T^- \\mid A^c) = 0.99$ (the specificity, given)\n- $P(A^c) = 0.8$\n\nSubstituting these values into the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^-) = (0.05)(0.2) + (0.99)(0.8)\n$$\n$$\nP(T^-) = 0.01 + 0.792 = 0.802\n$$\n\nNow, we can substitute all calculated values back into Bayes' theorem to find the final posterior probability:\n$$\nP(A \\mid T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- \\mid A) P(A)}{P(T^-)} = \\frac{(0.05)(0.2)}{0.802}\n$$\n$$\nP(A \\mid T^-) = \\frac{0.01}{0.802}\n$$\n$$\nP(A \\mid T^-) \\approx 0.0124688279...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $2$, $4$, and $6$. The fifth significant figure is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the last significant digit.\n$$\nP(A \\mid T^-) \\approx 0.01247\n$$\nThus, the posterior probability that the adolescent is pregnant despite a negative test result is approximately $0.01247$.",

            "problem": "A $16$-year-old nulliparous adolescent presents for contraceptive counseling. She reports a single-rod, subdermal etonogestrel implant placed in her left arm “about $40$ months ago” in another country, but she cannot provide documentation. She desires to avoid pregnancy and “continue with the implant if possible.” She had penile–vaginal intercourse without barrier protection $48$ hours ago. A point-of-care urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test today is negative. On careful bilateral upper-arm examination with the patient supine and the arm abducted, the rod is nonpalpable, though a faint linear scar is visible approximately $7$ cm proximal to the medial epicondyle. Body mass index (BMI) is $32$ kg/m$^2$. There is no arm pain, paresthesia, or visible asymmetry.  \n\nYou must determine whether the implant is present and, if present, whether it is currently providing contraceptive effectiveness. Construct a management plan that addresses both immediate pregnancy risk and safe localization/removal or replacement of a nonpalpable implant.  \n\nUse only the following foundational facts and definitions as your starting point:  \n- Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC) includes the etonogestrel implant, a single radiopaque rod placed subdermally in the upper arm that continuously releases etonogestrel, primarily suppressing ovulation.  \n- The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling for the etonogestrel implant specifies a duration of contraceptive efficacy of $3$ years; serum etonogestrel concentrations decline slowly over time and suppression of ovulation requires maintenance above a threshold on the order of $90$ pg/mL, but routine serum measurement is not recommended nor readily available.  \n- Palpation can confirm implant presence when the rod is subdermal and accessible; inability to palpate requires imaging to confirm presence and location prior to any removal attempt.  \n- The implant’s radiopacity permits visualization on plain radiography; high-frequency linear ultrasound can localize depth and relation to neurovascular structures; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an alternative when radiography or ultrasound are inconclusive.  \n- Emergency Contraception (EC) reduces pregnancy risk after unprotected intercourse within $5$ days; copper intrauterine device EC is unaffected by BMI or progestin exposure, and oral EC effectiveness may vary by BMI and can interact with ongoing progestin exposure.  \n- Initiation or continuation of a progestin-containing method after ulipristal acetate EC should be delayed by $5$ days due to pharmacodynamic interaction; backup contraception is indicated for $7$ days after initiating or re-initiating hormonal contraception depending on timing and method.  \n\nWhich of the following management plans best aligns with these principles and provides a safe, evidence-based approach for confirming implant presence and functionality by palpation and timing, and managing a nonpalpable implant?\n\nA. Treat her as not currently protected by the implant given a likely duration beyond the $3$-year label and nonpalpable status. Offer copper intrauterine device EC within $5$ days; if she declines, offer oral EC with counseling on BMI-related efficacy and interactions. Provide immediate backup contraception for $7$ days. Begin localization with a left upper-arm plain radiograph to confirm presence (radiopaque), followed by high-frequency linear ultrasound to define depth and proximity to neurovascular structures; if not visualized in the arm, obtain a chest radiograph to assess for rare migration. Avoid blind removal; refer to an experienced clinician for image-guided removal and same-encounter replacement of a new implant once located and removed. Repeat pregnancy testing in $2$ to $3$ weeks.\n\nB. Attempt blind removal in the clinic by incising over the scar and probing for the rod; provide ulipristal acetate EC today, and immediately place a new implant at the same visit regardless of whether the old implant is found, since she is at risk for pregnancy.\n\nC. Reassure the patient that the implant is effective for up to $5$ years based on extended-use data, so no EC is needed; schedule a replacement at $5$ years and defer imaging because the presence of a scar is sufficient evidence of the rod’s presence.\n\nD.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Patient Profile**: A $16$-year-old nulliparous adolescent.\n-   **Presenting Complaint**: Seeking contraceptive counseling.\n-   **Contraceptive History**: Reports a single-rod, subdermal etonogestrel implant placed in her left arm “about $40$ months ago” in another country.

Serum etonogestrel concentrations must be maintained above a threshold of approximately $90$ pg/mL to suppress ovulation. Routine serum measurement is not recommended or readily available.\n    3.  **Palpation**: A nonpalpable implant requires imaging to confirm presence and location before any removal attempt.\n    4.  **Imaging**: The implant is radiopaque (visible on plain radiography). High-frequency linear ultrasound localizes depth and relation to neurovascular structures. MRI is an alternative.\n    5.  **Emergency Contraception (EC)**: Effective within $5$ days post-intercourse. Copper IUD EC is unaffected by BMI or progestin exposure. Oral EC effectiveness may vary by BMI and interact with progestins.\n    6.  **EC Interaction**: Initiation of progestin methods should be delayed by $5$ days after ulipristal acetate EC. Backup contraception is indicated for $7$ days after starting/re-initiating hormonal contraception.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of reproductive health, pharmacology, and medical procedures. The \"foundational facts\" provided are consistent with clinical guidelines from major medical bodies (e.g., ACOG, CDC) regarding the management of etonogestrel implants and emergency contraception. The scenario is clinically realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a specific clinical scenario with sufficient, consistent information and asks for the best management plan based on a given set of principles. A logical, optimal solution can be derived.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. Patient history is reported as such (\"reports,\" \"about $40$ months ago\"), and physical findings are described factually. The task requires a decision based on the provided evidence-based principles, not subjective opinion.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and realistic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Management Plan\n\n1.  **Assessment of Contraceptive Efficacy**: The patient reports the implant was placed \"about $40$ months ago.\" Since $40$ months is greater than $3$ years ($36$ months), the implant is beyond its FDA-labeled duration of effectiveness. The foundational facts state that efficacy is specified for $3$ years. Therefore, regardless of whether the implant is present, it cannot be considered to be providing reliable contraception. The patient must be managed as if she is not using effective contraception.\n\n2.  **Assessment of Immediate Pregnancy Risk**: The patient had unprotected intercourse $48$ hours ago. Given the questionable efficacy of the implant, she is at risk for pregnancy. A urine hCG test is negative today, which rules out a pregnancy established more than $2-3$ weeks ago, but it is too early to rule out pregnancy from the intercourse $48$ hours ago. Therefore, emergency contraception (EC) is indicated.\n\n3.  **Selection of Emergency Contraception**: The patient is within the $5$-day ($120$-hour) window for all forms of EC. The foundational facts provide crucial guidance:\n    -   The patient's BMI is $32$ kg/m$^2$.\n    -   Copper IUD EC \"is unaffected by BMI.\"\n    -   Oral EC \"effectiveness may vary by BMI.\"\n    -   Oral EC (specifically ulipristal acetate, a common option) interacts with progestins. If the old implant is still present and releasing some hormone, or if a new one is placed, this interaction is clinically significant. The copper IUD avoids this issue.\n    -   Based on these principles, the copper IUD is the most effective EC option for this patient. If she declines it, oral EC should be offered with explicit counseling regarding potentially reduced effectiveness due to her BMI.\n\n4.  **Management of the Nonpalpable Implant**:\n    -   **Presence**: The implant is nonpalpable. The presence of a scar is suggestive, but not definitive proof, that an implant is currently in situ. It must be located before any removal attempt.\n    -   **Localization**: The foundational facts explicitly state, \"inability to palpate requires imaging to confirm presence and location prior to any removal attempt.\" Therefore, blind exploration is contraindicated.\n    -   **Imaging Modality**: The principles specify the correct imaging sequence. The implant is \"radiopaque,\" so a plain radiograph of the upper arm is the appropriate first step to confirm its presence. If present, \"high-frequency linear ultrasound\" should be used to determine its exact depth and relationship to neurovascular structures, which is critical for safe removal. Migration is rare but possible, so if it is not found in the arm, a chest radiograph would be a logical next step.\n    -   **Removal**: Removal should be performed by a clinician experienced in this procedure, ideally with image guidance, to minimize the risk of injury to nerves or blood vessels. Blind removal attempts are dangerous and must be avoided.\n    -   **Continuation**: The patient wishes to \"continue with the implant if possible.\" The plan should include placement of a new implant at the same visit as the removal of the old one, assuming it is located and removed successfully.\n\n5.  **Follow-up and Ancillary Care**:\n    -   A follow-up pregnancy test should be scheduled for $2$ to $3$ weeks after the episode of unprotected intercourse to definitively rule out pregnancy.\n    -   Backup contraception (e.g., condoms) should be advised until the permanent contraceptive situation is resolved and effective (e.g., for $7$ days after a new implant is placed).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Treat her as not currently protected by the implant given a likely duration beyond the $3$-year label and nonpalpable status. Offer copper intrauterine device EC within $5$ days; if she declines, offer oral EC with counseling on BMI-related efficacy and interactions. Provide immediate backup contraception for $7$ days. Begin localization with a left upper-arm plain radiograph to confirm presence (radiopaque), followed by high-frequency linear ultrasound to define depth and proximity to neurovascular structures; if not visualized in the arm, obtain a chest radiograph to assess for rare migration. Avoid blind removal; refer to an experienced clinician for image-guided removal and same-encounter replacement of a new implant once located and removed. Repeat pregnancy testing in $2$ to $3$ weeks.**\n-   This plan correctly assumes a lack of contraceptive protection due to the implant's age and nonpalpable status.\n-   It correctly prioritizes the most effective EC (copper IUD) based on the patient's BMI, with appropriate counseling for the alternative.\n-   It mandates the correct, safe imaging sequence (radiograph then ultrasound) for a nonpalpable implant and explicitly forbids blind removal.\n-   It includes referral to an expert for removal and addresses the patient's desire for continuation.\n-   It includes necessary follow-up (backup contraception, repeat pregnancy test).\n-   This plan aligns perfectly with the derived correct management plan and all provided foundational facts.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Attempt blind removal in the clinic by incising over the scar and probing for the rod; provide ulipristal acetate EC today, and immediately place a new implant at the same visit regardless of whether the old implant is found, since she is at risk for pregnancy.**\n-   This plan recommends \"blind removal,\" which is explicitly contraindicated by the foundational fact that nonpalpable implants require imaging before removal. This is a critical safety violation.\n-   It recommends ulipristal acetate EC and immediate placement of a new implant. The foundational facts state that progestin-containing methods should be delayed by $5$ days after ulipristal acetate EC. This is a pharmacological contradiction and would compromise the efficacy of both the EC and the new implant.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Reassure the patient that the implant is effective for up to $5$ years based on extended-use data, so no EC is needed; schedule a replacement at $5$ years and defer imaging because the presence of a scar is sufficient evidence of the rod’s presence.**\n-   This plan provides false reassurance. The foundational facts specify a $3$-year duration of efficacy. Ignoring the pregnancy risk and failing to offer EC is clinically unsound.\n-   It incorrectly states that a scar is sufficient evidence of presence. More importantly, it defers imaging for a nonpalpable implant, which is necessary for safe future removal, violating a key principle.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Order a serum etonogestrel concentration; if it is greater than $90$ pg/mL, conclude the implant is present and functional, obviating EC and imaging; if it is less than $90$ pg/mL, proceed to removal without imaging and start combined oral contraception the same day.**\n-   This plan relies on a serum etonogestrel level, which the foundational facts state is \"not recommended nor readily available.\" This is not a standard or practical approach.\n-   Crucially, if the level is low, it advises \"removal without imaging.\" This constitutes a blind removal attempt on a nonpalpable implant, a major safety violation. A drug level provides no information about the implant's anatomical location.\n-   Even a high level does not obviate the need for imaging, as the nonpalpable implant will eventually need to be located for removal.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
