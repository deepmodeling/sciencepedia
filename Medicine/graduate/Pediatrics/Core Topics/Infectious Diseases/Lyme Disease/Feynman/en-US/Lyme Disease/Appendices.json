            "problem": "A pediatric infectious diseases service wants to formalize how pretest probability influences the interpretation of a positive first-tier Lyme antibody test in children. Consider a $9$-year-old with nonspecific fatigue in late summer, no erythema migrans, and no known tick attachment longer than $36$ hours, living in a region with low pediatric Lyme incidence. The clinician orders a first-tier enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies. Assume the EIA has sensitivity $\\mathrm{Se}=0.90$ and specificity $\\mathrm{Sp}=0.95$ for the pediatric population being tested. The clinician estimates the child’s pretest probability $\\pi$ of true Lyme disease to be $\\pi=0.01$ based on epidemiology and clinical presentation.\n\nStarting from the foundational form of Bayes’ theorem, namely that for events $A$ and $B$ with $P(B)>0$, $P(A\\mid B)=\\dfrac{P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$, and using only core test characteristic definitions (sensitivity as $P(+\\mid D)$ and specificity as $P(-\\mid \\overline{D})$), do the following:\n\n1. Derive from first principles an expression for the positive predictive value $\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi)=P(D\\mid +)$ in terms of $\\mathrm{Se}$, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, and $\\pi$, and then determine analytically whether $\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi)$ increases or decreases as $\\pi$ increases.\n2. Apply your derived expression to compute the numerical value of $\\mathrm{PPV}$ for the child described above using $\\mathrm{Se}=0.90$, $\\mathrm{Sp}=0.95$, and $\\pi=0.01$.\n\nReport the final numerical answer to part $2$ as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiology and biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated objectively. The provided values for sensitivity, specificity, and pretest probability are realistic for the described clinical scenario. The task requires a standard, but rigorous, application of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the child has true Lyme disease, and let $\\overline{D}$ be the event that the child does not have Lyme disease. Let $+$ be the event that the first-tier EIA test result is positive. We are asked to find the positive predictive value ($\\mathrm{PPV}$), which is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, denoted as $P(D\\mid +)$.\n\nThe information provided can be expressed in probabilistic terms:\n- The pretest probability of Lyme disease is $P(D) = \\pi = 0.01$.\n- The probability of not having Lyme disease is $P(\\overline{D}) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi$.\n- The sensitivity of the test is $\\mathrm{Se} = P(+\\mid D) = 0.90$. This is the probability of a positive test given that the child has the disease.\n- The specificity of the test is $\\mathrm{Sp} = P(-\\mid \\overline{D}) = 0.95$, where $-$ denotes a negative test result. This is the probability of a negative test given that the child does not have the disease.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation and Analysis of $\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi)$\n\nThe derivation begins with the foundational form of Bayes' theorem provided in the problem statement, $P(A\\mid B)=\\dfrac{P(B\\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}$. We set $A=D$ and $B=+$, yielding:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi) = P(D\\mid +) = \\frac{P(+\\mid D)P(D)}{P(+)}\n$$\nThe numerator can be immediately expressed in terms of the given quantities: $P(+\\mid D)P(D) = (\\mathrm{Se})(\\pi)$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, conditioning on the disease status:\n$$\nP(+) = P(+\\mid D)P(D) + P(+\\mid \\overline{D})P(\\overline{D})\n$$\nWe know $P(+\\mid D) = \\mathrm{Se}$, $P(D) = \\pi$, and $P(\\overline{D}) = 1 - \\pi$. The term $P(+\\mid \\overline{D})$ is the probability of a positive test in a person without the disease (a false positive). This is related to the specificity, $\\mathrm{Sp}$. For any individual without the disease, the test can be either positive or negative, so $P(+\\mid \\overline{D}) + P(-\\mid \\overline{D}) = 1$. The specificity is defined as $\\mathrm{Sp} = P(-\\mid \\overline{D})$, so we have:\n$$\nP(+\\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - P(-\\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}\n$$\nSubstituting these terms back into the expression for $P(+)$:\n$$\nP(+) = (\\mathrm{Se})(\\pi) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - \\pi)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into Bayes' theorem to obtain the final form of $\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi) = \\frac{(\\mathrm{Se})(\\pi)}{(\\mathrm{Se})(\\pi) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - \\pi)}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation of $\\mathrm{PPV}$ in terms of $\\mathrm{Se}$, $\\mathrm{Sp}$, and $\\pi$.\n\nTo determine analytically whether $\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi)$ increases or decreases as $\\pi$ increases, we compute the derivative of $\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi)$ with respect to $\\pi$. Let's rewrite the function for clarity:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi) = \\frac{(\\mathrm{Se})\\pi}{(\\mathrm{Se} - (1 - \\mathrm{Sp}))\\pi + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})} = \\frac{(\\mathrm{Se})\\pi}{(\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)\\pi + 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}}\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, with $u = (\\mathrm{Se})\\pi$ and $v = (\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)\\pi + 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\pi} \\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi) = \\frac{(\\mathrm{Se}) \\cdot [(\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)\\pi + 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}] - [(\\mathrm{Se})\\pi] \\cdot (\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)}{[(\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)\\pi + 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}]^2}\n$$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$\n(\\mathrm{Se})(\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)\\pi + (\\mathrm{Se})(1 - \\mathrm{Sp}) - (\\mathrm{Se})(\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)\\pi = (\\mathrm{Se})(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})\n$$\nSo, the derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\pi} \\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi) = \\frac{(\\mathrm{Se})(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})}{[(\\mathrm{Se} + \\mathrm{Sp} - 1)\\pi + 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}]^2} = \\frac{(\\mathrm{Se})(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})}{[(\\mathrm{Se})(\\pi) + (1 - \\mathrm{Sp})(1 - \\pi)]^2} = \\frac{(\\mathrm{Se})(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})}{[P(+)]^2}\n$$\nFor a diagnostic test to be informative, its sensitivity $\\mathrm{Se}$ must be greater than $0$ and its specificity $\\mathrm{Sp}$ must be less than $1$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Se} > 0$ and $1 - \\mathrm{Sp} > 0$. The product $(\\mathrm{Se})(1 - \\mathrm{Sp})$ is therefore positive. The denominator, $[P(+)]^2$, is the square of a probability and is also positive (as long as a positive test is possible). Since the derivative is strictly positive for $\\pi \\in (0,1)$, the function $\\mathrm{PPV}(\\pi)$ is a monotonically increasing function of the pretest probability $\\pi$.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Calculation of PPV\n\nWe apply the derived expression to compute the numerical value of the PPV for the child described, using the given parameters: $\\mathrm{Se}=0.90$, $\\mathrm{Sp}=0.95$, and $\\pi=0.01$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the values for the components of the formula:\n- $\\mathrm{Se} = 0.90$\n- $\\pi = 0.01$\n- $1 - \\mathrm{Sp} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$\n- $1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$\n\nNow, substitute these into the $\\mathrm{PPV}$ formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.01)}{(0.90)(0.01) + (0.05)(0.99)}\n$$\nCalculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n- Numerator: $0.90 \\times 0.01 = 0.009$\n- Denominator, first term (true positives): $0.90 \\times 0.01 = 0.009$\n- Denominator, second term (false positives): $0.05 \\times 0.99 = 0.0495$\n- Denominator (total probability of a positive test): $0.009 + 0.0495 = 0.0585$\n\nSo, the PPV is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{0.009}{0.0585}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.15384615...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $5$, $3$, and $8$. The fifth significant digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the last digit.\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.1538\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that even with a positive test from an assay with relatively high sensitivity and specificity, the low pretest probability results in a post-test probability of disease of only about $15.4\\%$.",
