The context is a standard application of Bayesian probability to medical diagnostics, a core quantitative skill in epidemiology and clinical medicine.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), and let $\\neg D$ be the event that the patient does not have HFMD. Let $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^{-}$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  The pretest probability of the disease, $P(D) = 0.40$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given the patient has the disease: $P(T^{+} \\mid D) = 0.90$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given the patient does not have the disease: $P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive complementary probabilities:\n- The probability that a patient does not have the disease is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n- The probability of a false negative (a negative test in a patient who has the disease) is $P(T^{-} \\mid D) = 1 - P(T^{+} \\mid D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n- The probability of a false positive (a positive test in a patient who does not have the disease) is $P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nOur objective is to derive and calculate the positive predictive value (PPV), $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, and the negative predictive value (NPV), $P(\\neg D \\mid T^{-})$.\n\n**Derivation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, denoted $P(D \\mid T^{+})$. According to Bayes' theorem, this is expressed as:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the total probability of a positive test.

Using Bayes' theorem for this case:\n$$\nP(\\neg D \\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(T^{-})}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^{-})$, is the total probability of a negative test.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid application of biostatistical principles to clinical data. The givens are self-consistent, scientifically sound, and sufficient to derive a unique answer among the provided options.\n\nThe core principle of a multivariable logistic regression model is that the logarithm of the odds (log-odds) of the outcome is a linear combination of the predictor variables. The model takes the form:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\beta_i x_i $$\nwhere $p$ is the probability of the outcome, $x_i$ are the predictor variables, and $\\beta_i$ are the regression coefficients representing the effect size of each predictor. For a binary predictor $x_i$ (coded as $1$ for present and $0$ for absent), the odds ratio ($\\mathrm{OR}_i$) is given by $\\mathrm{OR}_i = e^{\\beta_i}$. Consequently, the coefficient $\\beta_i$ is the natural logarithm of the odds ratio: $\\beta_i = \\ln(\\mathrm{OR}_i)$.\n\nThe task is to create an integer point-based risk score where the points assigned to each predictor are proportional to their respective effect sizes, the $\\beta_i$ coefficients. Therefore, the score points $S_i$ must be proportional to $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR}_i)$.\n$$ S_i \\propto \\ln(\\mathrm{OR}_i) $$\nWe are given the adjusted odds ratios for $6$ predictors:\n1.  Age under $3$ years: $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Age}} = 1.9$\n2.  Persistent high fever: $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Fever}} = 2.6$\n3.  Myoclonus: $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Myoclonus}} = 5.0$\n4.  Vomiting: $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Vomiting}} = 1.5$\n5.  Tachycardia: $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Tachycardia}} = 2.2$\n6.  Leukocytosis: $\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Leukocytosis}} = 2.0$\n\nFirst, we calculate the natural logarithm of each odds ratio to determine the relative effect sizes ($\\beta_i$ values).\n- $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Age}}) = \\ln(1.9) \\approx 0.6419$\n- $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Fever}}) = \\ln(2.6) \\approx 0.9555$\n- $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Myoclonus}}) = \\ln(5.0) \\approx 1.6094$\n- $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Vomiting}}) = \\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.4055$\n- $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Tachycardia}}) = \\ln(2.2) \\approx 0.7885$\n- $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR}_{\\text{Leukocytosis}}) = \\ln(2.0) \\approx 0.6931$\n\nTo create a simple integer score, we can normalize these values. A standard method is to set the predictor with the smallest effect size to a score of $1$ point and scale the others proportionally. The smallest effect size is for vomiting, with $\\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.4055$. We use this value as our base unit for scaling.\n\nWe calculate the scaled, non-integer scores by dividing each $\\ln(\\mathrm{OR})$ value by the smallest value, $\\ln(1.5)$:\n- Age: $\\frac{0.6419}{0.4055} \\approx 1.583$\n- Fever: $\\frac{0.9555}{0.4055} \\approx 2.356$\n- Myoclonus: $\\frac{1.6094}{0.4055} \\approx 3.969$\n- Vomiting: $\\frac{0.4055}{0.4055} = 1.000$\n- Tachycardia: $\\frac{0.7885}{0.4055} \\approx 1.944$\n- Leukocytosis: $\\frac{0.6931}{0.4055} \\approx 1.709$\n\nThe problem asks for the set of integer points that best approximates this correct weighting. A standard and objective method is to round these scaled values to the nearest integer.\n- Age: $\\mathrm{round}(1.583) = 2$\n- Fever: $\\mathrm{round}(2.356) = 2$\n- Myoclonus: $\\mathrm{round}(3.969) = 4$\n- Vomiting: $\\mathrm{round}(1.000) = 1$\n- Tachycardia: $\\mathrm{round}(1.944) = 2$\n- Leukocytosis: $\\mathrm{round}(1.709) = 2$\n\nThis procedure yields the following integer point set:\n- Age under $3$ years: $2$ points\n- Persistent high fever: $2$ points\n- Myoclonus: $4$ points\n- Vomiting: $1$ point\n- Tachycardia: $2$ points\n- Leukocytosis: $2$ points\n\nNow we evaluate each provided option against this derived result.\n\nA. Age under $3$ years $=2$; persistent high fever $=2$; myoclonus $=4$; vomiting $=1$; tachycardia $=2$; leukocytosis $=2$.\nThis set of points is identical to the set derived by scaling the log-odds and rounding to the nearest integer. The points $\\{2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 2\\}$ accurately reflect the relative contributions of the predictors according to the specified methodology.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. Age under $3$ years $=1$; persistent high fever $=3$; myoclonus $=4$; vomiting $=1$; tachycardia $=2$; leukocytosis $=1$.\nThis set poorly approximates the calculated relative weights. For example, Age (scaled weight $\\approx 1.58$) and Leukocytosis (scaled weight $\\approx 1.71$) are both assigned $1$ point, which does not reflect their values being closer to $2$. Persistent high fever (scaled weight $\\approx 2.36$) is assigned $3$ points, which is a larger rounding error than assigning it $2$ points.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. Age under $3$ years $=2$; persistent high fever $=3$; myoclonus $=3$; vomiting $=1$; tachycardia $=2$; leukocytosis $=2$.\nThis option incorrectly assigns points to Persistent high fever and Myoclonus. The scaled weight for Myoclonus is $\\approx 3.969$, which unequivocally rounds to $4$, not $3$. The scaled weight for Fever is $\\approx 2.356$, which rounds to $2$, not $3$. These assignments do not preserve the relative effect sizes as accurately as option A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. Age under $3$ years $=1$; persistent high fever $=2$; myoclonus $=5$; vomiting $=1$; tachycardia $=1$; leukocytosis $=2$.\nThis option contains multiple inaccuracies. The scaled weight for Myoclonus ($\\approx 3.969$) is much closer to $4$ than $5$. The scaled weight for Tachycardia ($\\approx 1.944$) is much closer to $2$ than $1$. The scaled weight for Age ($\\approx 1.583$) is closer to $2$ than $1$. This set significantly distorts the relative risk contributions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on a systematic derivation from the principles of logistic regression, only Option A provides a set of integer points that correctly and consistently approximates the relative contributions of the predictors.",
