This exercise hones the fundamental skill of translating a patient's metabolic tolerance, determined by monitoring plasma $Phe$ levels, into a practical daily allowance of natural protein.

Natural intact protein contains approximately $50\\,\\text{mg}$ of Phe per $\\text{g}$ of protein, and the remainder of protein needs will be supplied by phenylalanine-free medical formula.\n\nUsing the principles of mass balance and dose-by-weight scaling, compute the maximum allowable intake of natural intact protein from ordinary foods (in $\\text{g/day}$) that does not exceed the tolerated Phe load.

            "solution": "The management of phenylketonuria (phenylketonuria) relies on controlling dietary phenylalanine (phenylalanine) intake to achieve a steady-state plasma concentration within a target therapeutic range. At steady state, input from diet equals utilization and obligatory losses such that plasma concentration remains stable. Clinically, this is operationalized as a tolerated phenylalanine intake per unit body mass that maintains the concentration within the target window. This establishes a linear dose-by-weight relationship: the maximum allowed phenylalanine intake per day is the product of the per-kilogram tolerance and body mass.\n\nDefine:\n- $W$ as body weight in $\\text{kg}$.\n- $T$ as tolerated phenylalanine intake in $\\text{mg/kg/day}$ at the target plasma level.\n- $I_{\\text{Phe}}$ as the allowed daily phenylalanine intake in $\\text{mg/day}$.\n- $c$ as the phenylalanine content of natural protein in $\\text{mg/g}$.\n- $P$ as the allowable grams of natural intact protein per day in $\\text{g/day}$.\n\nBy dose-by-weight scaling,\n$$\nI_{\\text{Phe}} = T \\times W.\n$$\nGiven that each gram of natural protein contributes $c$ milligrams of phenylalanine, the mass balance conversion from phenylalanine allowance to grams of protein is\n$$\nP = \\frac{I_{\\text{Phe}}}{c} = \\frac{T \\times W}{c}.\n$$\n\nSubstitute the provided values $T = 30\\,\\text{mg/kg/day}$, $W = 10\\,\\text{kg}$, and $c = 50\\,\\text{mg/g}$:\n$$\nP = \\frac{30\\,\\text{mg/kg/day} \\times 10\\,\\text{kg}}{50\\,\\text{mg/g}}.\n$$\nCarry out the unit analysis:\n- The numerator is $30 \\times 10 = 300\\,\\text{mg/day}$.\n- Dividing by $50\\,\\text{mg/g}$ yields\n$$\nP = \\frac{300\\,\\text{mg/day}}{50\\,\\text{mg/g}} = 6\\,\\text{g/day}.\n$$\n\nRegarding significant figures, the provided values $30\\,\\text{mg/kg/day}$, $10\\,\\text{kg}$, and $50\\,\\text{mg/g}$ support reporting to two significant figures.

The specified fraction is $0.30$. This condition can be expressed mathematically as an inequality:\n$$\\Delta C \\ge 0.30 \\times C_0$$\nThe problem asks for the *minimum* absolute decrease in plasma Phe concentration that would satisfy this responsiveness criterion. This minimum value, which we shall denote as $\\Delta C_{\\text{min}}$, corresponds to the case where the inequality becomes an equality:\n$$\\Delta C_{\\text{min}} = 0.30 \\times C_0$$\nNow, we substitute the given value for the baseline concentration, $C_0 = 720\\,\\mu\\text{mol/L}$, into this equation to find the minimum required decrease.\n$$\\Delta C_{\\text{min}} = 0.30 \\times 720\\,\\mu\\text{mol/L}$$\nPerforming the multiplication yields:\n$$\\Delta C_{\\text{min}} = 216\\,\\mu\\text{mol/L}$$\nThe problem specifies that the final answer should be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value, $216$, consists of three digits ($2$, $1$, and $6$), all of which are significant.
