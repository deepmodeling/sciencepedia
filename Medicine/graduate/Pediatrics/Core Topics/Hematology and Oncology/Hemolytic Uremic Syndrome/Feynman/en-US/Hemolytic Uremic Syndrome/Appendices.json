This exercise provides hands-on practice in this critical skill, requiring you to apply the standard Holliday-Segar method for maintenance fluids and integrate it with a cautious, disease-specific strategy for deficit replacement in a child with STEC-HUS .",

There are no ongoing gastrointestinal losses requiring replacement during the first $24 \\ \\mathrm{h}$ of inpatient management.

            "solution": "The task is to calculate the constant intravenous fluid infusion rate in $\\mathrm{mL/h}$ for a child during the first $24$ hours of management for HUS. This rate is the sum of the daily maintenance fluid requirement and the volume designated for partial rehydration of the fluid deficit.\n\nFirst, we calculate the daily maintenance fluid requirement using the Holliday–Segar method. The patient's weight is given as $W = 15 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$. The Holliday–Segar formula for daily fluid needs is as follows:\n- For body weight up to $10 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$: $100 \\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$\n- For body weight from $10.1$ to $20 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$: $1000 \\ \\mathrm{mL} + 50 \\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$ for each kg over $10 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- For body weight over $20 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$: $1500 \\ \\mathrm{mL} + 20 \\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$ for each kg over $20 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n\nThe patient weighs $15 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$, which falls into the second category.\nThe fluid for the first $10 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$ of weight is:\n$$ V_1 = 10 \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times 100 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mL} $$\nThe remaining weight is $15 \\ \\mathrm{kg} - 10 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 5 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$. The fluid requirement for this portion is:\n$$ V_2 = 5 \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times 50 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 250 \\ \\mathrm{mL} $$\nThe total daily maintenance fluid volume, $V_{\\text{maint}}$, is the sum of these two components:\n$$ V_{\\text{maint}} = V_1 + V_2 = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mL} + 250 \\ \\mathrm{mL} = 1250 \\ \\mathrm{mL} $$\nThis volume is for a $24$-hour period.\n\nNext, we calculate the fluid deficit. The problem states that moderate dehydration corresponds to a fluid deficit of $0.07$ of the body weight in kilograms.\nThe mass of the fluid deficit, $D_{\\text{mass}}$, is:\n$$ D_{\\text{mass}} = 0.07 \\times W = 0.07 \\times 15 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 1.05 \\ \\mathrm{kg} $$\nThe problem provides the conversion that $1 \\ \\mathrm{kg}$ of body mass deficit is equivalent to $1 \\ \\mathrm{L}$ of water deficit, where $1 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 1000 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$. Therefore, the total volume of the fluid deficit, $V_{\\text{deficit}}$, is:\n$$ V_{\\text{deficit}} = 1.05 \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times \\frac{1000 \\ \\mathrm{mL}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{kg}} = 1050 \\ \\mathrm{mL} $$\nThe rehydration plan specifies replacing only half ($50\\%$) of this calculated deficit over the first $24$ hours. The volume of deficit to be replaced in the first $24$ hours, $V_{\\text{def,24h}}$, is:\n$$ V_{\\text{def,24h}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times V_{\\text{deficit}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1050 \\ \\mathrm{mL} = 525 \\ \\mathrm{mL} $$\n\nThe total fluid volume to be infused over the first $24$ hours, $V_{\\text{total,24h}}$, is the sum of the maintenance fluid and the planned deficit replacement volume.\n$$ V_{\\text{total,24h}} = V_{\\text{maint}} + V_{\\text{def,24h}} = 1250 \\ \\mathrm{mL} + 525 \\ \\mathrm{mL} = 1775 \\ \\mathrm{mL} $$\nThis total volume is to be administered at a constant rate over a period of $T = 24 \\ \\mathrm{h}$. The infusion rate, $R$, is calculated by dividing the total volume by the time period.\n$$ R = \\frac{V_{\\text{total,24h}}}{T} = \\frac{1775 \\ \\mathrm{mL}}{24 \\ \\mathrm{h}} $$\n$$ R \\approx 73.958333... \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mL}}{\\mathrm{h}} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is the standard clinical measure for kidney function.

            "problem": "A $9$-year-old child is admitted with diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is to be determined as part of renal function assessment.

            "solution": "The estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a cornerstone of assessing kidney function. The gold standard, measurement of inulin clearance, is invasive and not practical for routine clinical settings. Therefore, eGFR is typically estimated using endogenous filtration markers.\n\nThe fundamental principle of clearance states that for a substance $X$, its clearance $C_X$ from the plasma is given by:\n$$\nC_X = \\frac{U_X \\cdot V}{P_X}\n$$\nwhere $U_X$ is the urinary concentration of the substance, $V$ is the urine flow rate, and $P_X$ is the plasma concentration of the substance.\n\nCreatinine, a metabolic byproduct of creatine phosphate in muscle, is used as such an endogenous marker. It is produced at a relatively constant rate, proportional to muscle mass, and is freely filtered by the glomerulus with minimal tubular secretion. Therefore, creatinine clearance ($C_{Cr}$) provides a reasonable approximation of the GFR. Under steady-state conditions, the rate of creatinine production (and thus urinary excretion) is constant.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Excretion} = U_{Cr} \\cdot V = C_{Cr} \\cdot P_{Cr}\n$$\nAssuming $C_{Cr} \\approx \\text{GFR}$ and letting $P_{Cr}$ be the serum creatinine (SCr), we have:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Production} \\approx \\text{GFR} \\cdot \\text{SCr}\n$$\nThis establishes the inverse relationship between GFR and SCr: $\\text{GFR} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\text{SCr}}$.\n\nIn the pediatric population, muscle mass is not constant but scales with body size. Body height (or length) is used as a surrogate for muscle mass. Combining these relationships, the rate of creatinine production is proportional to height. Therefore, the estimation of GFR takes the general form:\n$$\n\\text{eGFR} \\propto \\frac{\\text{Height}}{\\text{SCr}}\n$$\nThis is the basis for the Schwartz formula, where the proportionality is resolved by an empirical constant, $k$:\n$$\n\\text{eGFR} = \\frac{k \\cdot \\text{Height}}{\\text{SCr}}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the use of the \"updated bedside Schwartz approach\" and an IDMS-traceable serum creatinine assay. The original Schwartz formula used different $k$ values based on age and sex. However, in $2009$, Schwartz et al. published an updated formula, often called the \"bedside Schwartz formula,\" specifically for use with modern, more accurate IDMS-traceable enzymatic creatinine assays. A key feature of this updated formula is the use of a single, unified constant for children and adolescents aged $1$ to $16$ years, simplifying its application.\n\nThe appropriate constant, $k$, for the updated bedside Schwartz formula is $0.413$. While the prompt text refers to an \"age/sex-dependent\" constant, this reflects the structure of the older formulas. The \"updated bedside approach\" itself simplifies this by using a single constant for the patient's age group.\n\nThe formula to be used is:\n$$\n\\text{eGFR (in mL/min/1.73 m}^2\\text{)} = \\frac{0.413 \\cdot \\text{Height} \\ (\\text{in} \\ \\mathrm{cm})}{\\text{SCr} \\ (\\text{in} \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL})}\n$$\nThe given values for the patient are:\n- Height = $130 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$\n- Serum Creatinine (SCr) = $0.8 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n- Constant ($k$) = $0.413$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$\n\\text{eGFR} = \\frac{0.413 \\cdot 130}{0.8}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\n0.413 \\cdot 130 = 53.69\n$$\nNow, perform the division:\n$$\n\\text{eGFR} = \\frac{53.69}{0.8} = 67.1125\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $67.1125 \\ \\mathrm{mL/min/1.73 \\ m^2}$. Rounding this to three significant figures gives $67.1$.\n\nThis value indicates a significant reduction in kidney function (normal eGFR is typically considered > 90 $\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73 \\ m^2}$), which is consistent with the diagnosis of acute kidney injury in the context of HUS.",

Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds Complement Component 5 (C5) and prevents terminal complement activation, thereby increasing the risk of invasive disease due to Neisseria meningitidis. It is a well-tested fact that to mitigate this risk, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine against serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY) and serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) should be administered at least $14$ days before the first dose of a terminal complement inhibitor; if urgent therapy must begin earlier, antibiotic prophylaxis should be provided to cover the interval before vaccine-induced protection is expected.\n\nAccording to United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling for atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS), children with body weight in the interval $20 \\leq W < 30$ kilograms receive eculizumab at a per-dose amount of $600$ milligrams.
