This exercise challenges you to translate fundamental epidemiological parameters—prevalence and complication risk—into a concrete public health metric: the expected number of symptomatic cases in a given cohort. Mastering this type of calculation allows clinicians and researchers to quantify disease burden and anticipate healthcare needs .",

            "problem": "A pediatric health services researcher is modeling the expected burden of symptomatic Meckel diverticulum in a defined cohort. Consider a closed cohort of $10{,}000$ children observed for one year. Assume the following two parameters hold uniformly across the cohort: the prevalence of Meckel diverticulum is $0.02$ (meaning the proportion of children who harbor a Meckel diverticulum at baseline is $0.02$), and, among those with a Meckel diverticulum, the annual probability of becoming symptomatic within the year is $0.04$. Assume symptomatic events in the year occur only in children who have a Meckel diverticulum, and treat each child’s status as independent of others for the purpose of expectation. Using only foundational probability concepts (definitions of prevalence and probability, the law of total probability, and linearity of expectation), compute the expected number of symptomatic cases over the year in this cohort. Express your final answer as a single real number representing the expected count of cases; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the expected number of symptomatic Meckel diverticulum cases in a specified pediatric cohort over a duration of one year. The solution will be derived by applying fundamental principles of probability theory.\n\nFirst, we identify and define the parameters provided in the problem statement.\nLet $N$ be the size of the cohort, which is given as $N = 10000$.\nLet the event that a child has a Meckel diverticulum be denoted by $MD$. The prevalence is given as the probability $P(MD) = 0.02$.\nLet the event that a child becomes symptomatic during the year be denoted by $S$.\nThe annual probability of a child becoming symptomatic, given that they have a Meckel diverticulum, is $P(S | MD) = 0.04$.\nThe problem also states that symptomatic events occur only in children who have a Meckel diverticulum. This is a crucial piece of information which formally translates to the conditional probability $P(S | \\neg MD) = 0$, where $\\neg MD$ is the event that a child does not have a Meckel diverticulum.\n\nThe objective is to find the total expected number of symptomatic cases in the cohort. To formalize this, we can define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for each child $i$ in the cohort, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$. The variable $X_i$ is defined as:\n$$\nX_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if child } i \\text{ becomes symptomatic} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of symptomatic cases, $X$, is the sum of these individual indicator variables:\n$$\nX = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\n$$\nWe are asked to compute the expectation of $X$, denoted $E[X]$.\n\nA fundamental property of expectation is its linearity. The expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations. Note that this property holds regardless of whether the random variables are independent.\n$$\nE[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]\n$$\nThe problem states that the prevalence and risk parameters are uniform across the cohort. This means that the probability of any given child becoming symptomatic is the same for all children. Consequently, the expected value $E[X_i]$ is identical for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. Let us denote this common expected value by $p$. The total expectation then simplifies to the product of the cohort size and this common probability:\n$$\nE[X] = N \\cdot p\n$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is simply the probability of the event it indicates. Therefore, $p = E[X_i] = P(X_i = 1) = P(S)$, which is the overall probability that a randomly selected child from the cohort becomes symptomatic within the year.\n\nTo calculate $P(S)$, we apply the law of total probability, conditioning on the presence or absence of a Meckel diverticulum:\n$$\nP(S) = P(S | MD) \\cdot P(MD) + P(S | \\neg MD) \\cdot P(\\neg MD)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values into this formula:\n$P(MD) = 0.02$\n$P(S | MD) = 0.04$\n$P(S | \\neg MD) = 0$\nThe probability $P(\\neg MD)$ is complementary to $P(MD)$, so $P(\\neg MD) = 1 - P(MD) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$. However, we do not need to use this value explicitly since its term is multiplied by $0$.\n$$\nP(S) = (0.04) \\cdot (0.02) + (0) \\cdot (0.98)\n$$\n$$\nP(S) = 0.0008 + 0\n$$\n$$\nP(S) = 0.0008\n$$\nThis value represents the unconditional probability that any single child in the cohort will develop symptoms within the year.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected total number of symptomatic cases, $E[X]$, by multiplying this probability by the total number of children in the cohort, $N$:\n$$\nE[X] = N \\cdot P(S) = 10000 \\cdot 0.0008\n$$\nThe calculation is straightforward:\n$$\nE[X] = 10^{4} \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-4}) = 8\n$$\nThe expected number of symptomatic cases over the year in this cohort is $8$.",

The choice must be made among colonoscopy, technetium-$99\\mathrm{m}$ pertechnetate Meckel scan, and Computed Tomography (CT) angiography. This evaluation requires an understanding of the indications, advantages, and limitations of each modality in the context of hemodynamic stability and the likely underlying pathophysiology.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Patient 1**:\n    *   Age: $3$ years.\n    *   Presentation: Sudden, painless, large-volume hematochezia (bright red blood per rectum), saturating multiple diapers over $1$ hour. Persistent brisk bleeding with clots.\n    *   Vitals: Heart rate $180$ beats/min, blood pressure $70/40\\ \\mathrm{mm\\ Hg}$, capillary refill $4$ seconds, cool extremities (indicative of hemorrhagic shock).\n    *   Labs: Hemoglobin $9.2\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$ (previously $12.0\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$).\n    *   Status: Hemodynamically unstable, receiving resuscitation.\n    *   Diagnostic Goal: Identify the source of a massive, life-threatening bleed.\n\n*   **Patient 2**:\n    *   Age: $5$ years.\n    *   Presentation: $3$-month history of intermittent, painless, small to moderate volume hematochezia.\n    *   Vitals: Heart rate $98$ beats/min, blood pressure $102/64\\ \\mathrm{mm\\ Hg}$ (stable).\n    *   Status: Hemodynamically stable, well-perfused.\n    *   Clinical Suspicion: High for Meckel diverticulum.\n    *   Diagnostic Goal: Confirm the suspected diagnosis in a stable patient.\n\n*   **Patient 3**:\n    *   Age: $14$ years.\n    *   Presentation: $1$ week of low-volume hematochezia, crampy lower abdominal pain, weight loss of $2\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ over $2$ months.\n    *   Vitals: Heart rate $84$ beats/min, blood pressure $112/68\\ \\mathrm{mm\\ Hg}$ (stable).\n    *   Physical Exam: Mild left lower quadrant tenderness.\n    *   Labs: Hemoglobin $11.5\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$. Mildly elevated inflammatory markers.\n    *   Clinical Suspicion: Colonic pathology (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease).\n    *   Diagnostic Goal: Investigate subacute symptoms suggestive of a colonic mucosal disease.\n\n*   **Available Tests**: Colonoscopy, technetium-$99\\mathrm{m}$ pertechnetate Meckel scan, CT angiography.\n*   **Assumptions**: All modalities are immediately available; resuscitation is ongoing where indicated.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, presenting classic and realistic pediatric case vignettes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical histories are internally consistent and accurately reflect the described conditions (hemorrhagic shock, stable chronic bleeding, inflammatory colitis). The diagnostic modalities are standard in clinical practice. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to arrive at a logical answer based on established medical principles and clinical algorithms. No scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe selection of the first diagnostic test is dictated by two primary factors: the patient's hemodynamic stability and the most probable diagnosis based on the clinical presentation.\n\n**Analysis for Patient 1**\n\nThis $3$-year-old patient is in hypovolemic shock due to a massive, active gastrointestinal bleed. The immediate priority is resuscitation, followed by rapid localization of the bleeding source to enable targeted intervention (surgical resection or angiographic embolization).\n\n*   **Colonoscopy**: This is a poor first choice. The patient's instability contraindicates the time required for a proper bowel preparation, which is essential for adequate visualization. Performing an emergent, unprepared colonoscopy in the setting of massive hemorrhage is fraught with difficulty; the lumen would be filled with blood and clots, making it nearly impossible to identify a specific bleeding point. The procedure itself could also exacerbate instability.\n*   **Meckel Scan (Technetium-$99\\mathrm{m}$ pertechnetate)**: While a bleeding Meckel diverticulum is a very likely cause in this age group with painless bleeding, the Meckel scan is not the optimal first test in this specific scenario of extreme instability. The scan identifies ectopic gastric mucosa, which is the underlying cause, but it does not directly visualize active extravasation with the same precision and rapidity as angiography. Its primary utility is in stable patients where Meckel diverticulum is suspected. In an unstable patient, the primary goal is rapid localization of the active bleeding site, wherever it may be.\n*   **CT Angiography (CTA)**: This is the most appropriate first diagnostic test. CTA is a rapid, non-invasive imaging modality that can survey the entire abdomen and pelvis. Its ability to detect bleeding depends on the rate of active hemorrhage, with a typical threshold of $>0.5\\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$. Given this patient's brisk hematochezia and hemodynamic collapse, the bleeding rate is certainly high enough for detection. CTA can precisely localize the site of active contrast extravasation, whether from a Meckel diverticulum, an arteriovenous malformation, or another source, thereby guiding immediate life-saving surgery or interventional radiology.\n\nTherefore, the correct first test for Patient $1$ is **CT angiography**.\n\n**Analysis for Patient 2**\n\nThis $5$-year-old patient is hemodynamically stable and has a classic history for a Meckel diverticulum: intermittent, painless, and occasionally significant hematochezia. The diagnostic goal is to confirm this high-probability diagnosis.\n\n*   **CT Angiography**: This is inappropriate. The patient is stable and likely not bleeding at a rate detectable by CTA at the moment of scanning. This test confers a significant radiation dose and requires intravenous contrast, making it unjustifiable as a first-line test for a non-emergent condition in a stable child.\n*   **Colonoscopy**: This test is unable to visualize a Meckel diverticulum, which is located in the distal ileum (small intestine). While it could rule out other less likely causes in the colon (e.g., polyps), it does not address the primary clinical suspicion. It would be a reasonable second-line test if the initial, more specific workup were negative.\n*   **Meckel Scan (Technetium-$99\\mathrm{m}$ pertechnetate)**: This is the definitive first-line test. The scan uses technetium-$99\\mathrm{m}$ pertechnetate, which is taken up by gastric mucosal cells. A bleeding Meckel diverticulum typically contains ectopic gastric mucosa, which ulcerates the adjacent ileum, causing hemorrhage. The scan is highly specific for this condition and has good sensitivity (approximately $85\\%$) in the pediatric population. Crucially, it does not require active bleeding for diagnosis. Given the stable patient and the classic history, this is the most logical, highest-yield, and most appropriate initial investigation.\n\nTherefore, the correct first test for Patient $2$ is a **Meckel scan**.\n\n**Analysis for Patient 3**\n\nThis $14$-year-old adolescent is hemodynamically stable with subacute symptoms: low-volume bleeding, crampy pain, weight loss, and localized tenderness. This constellation of findings is highly suggestive of a mucosal inflammatory process within the colon, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rather than a vascular lesion or a Meckel diverticulum (which typically presents with painless bleeding).\n\n*   **CT Angiography**: This is not indicated. The bleeding is low-volume and likely not rapid enough to be detected. The clinical picture does not suggest an acute vascular catastrophe.\n*   **Meckel Scan**: This is also not indicated. The presence of pain, weight loss, and the adolescent age group make a Meckel diverticulum a much less likely diagnosis compared to IBD.\n*   **Colonoscopy**: This is the most appropriate first test. The patient is stable, allowing for a safe and effective bowel preparation. Colonoscopy provides direct visualization of the entire colonic mucosa, allowing for the identification of inflammation, ulcerations, polyps, or other lesions. Most importantly, it allows for tissue biopsy, which is essential for a definitive histopathological diagnosis of conditions like ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Given the symptoms, colonoscopy is the gold standard and offers the highest diagnostic yield.\n\nTherefore, the correct first test for Patient $3$ is **Colonoscopy**.\n\n### Summary and Option Evaluation\n\n*   Patient 1: **CT angiography** (unstable, massive active bleeding needing rapid localization).\n*   Patient 2: **Meckel scan** (stable, classic history for Meckel diverticulum).\n*   Patient 3: **Colonoscopy** (stable, symptoms suggest colonic mucosal disease like IBD).\n\nThe correct sequence of tests is: CT angiography, Meckel scan, Colonoscopy.\n\n*   **A. CT angiography; Meckel scan; Colonoscopy**: This option correctly lists the first test for Patient $1$ as CT angiography, for Patient $2$ as Meckel scan, and for Patient $3$ as Colonoscopy. This matches our derived conclusion. **Correct**.\n*   **B. Colonoscopy; CT angiography; Meckel scan**: This option is incorrect. Colonoscopy is wrong for Patient $1$, CT angiography is wrong for Patient $2$, and Meckel scan is wrong for Patient $3$. **Incorrect**.\n*   **C. CT angiography; Colonoscopy; Meckel scan**: This option is incorrect. It suggests Colonoscopy for Patient $2$ and Meckel scan for Patient $3$, which is the reverse of the correct choices. **Incorrect**.\n*   **D. Meckel scan; CT angiography; Colonoscopy**: This option is incorrect. It suggests Meckel scan for Patient $1$ and CT angiography for Patient $2$, both of which are inappropriate first choices for those scenarios. **Incorrect**.",
