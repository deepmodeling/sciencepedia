            "introduction": "The journey of managing cerebral palsy (CP) begins with early identification. While screening tools like the General Movements Assessment have improved our ability to detect infants at high risk, no test is perfect. This practice challenges you to apply fundamental principles of biostatistics to a realistic clinical scenario, moving beyond simply knowing the definitions of sensitivity and specificity to calculating a test's real-world utility. By deriving the positive predictive value (PPV), you will gain a deeper appreciation for how disease prevalence impacts screening outcomes and practice the essential skill of translating statistical data into clear, compassionate counseling for families .",

            "problem": "A tertiary neonatal follow-up clinic integrates two early screening tools for cerebral palsy: the General Movements Assessment and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination. In a defined high-risk cohort followed from birth to $12$ months, the combined screening strategy has sensitivity $0.90$ and specificity $0.95$. The cohort’s cerebral palsy prevalence, interpreted as the pre-test probability, is $0.02$. Starting only from the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence as probabilities, and using general probability laws, derive the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the probability of cerebral palsy given a positive combined screen. Express the PPV as a decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures. Then, based on the numerical PPV you computed, articulate the implications for counseling families regarding confirmatory diagnostics and early management planning without assuming any shortcut formulas. The final numerical answer should be the PPV only; express it as a decimal fraction, not with a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of the positive predictive value (PPV) of a combined screening strategy for cerebral palsy, and an articulation of its clinical implications. The derivation must start from the fundamental definitions of probability.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an infant has cerebral palsy.\nLet $D^c$ be the event that an infant does not have cerebral palsy.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the combined screening test is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the combined screening test is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into probabilistic terms:\n1.  The prevalence of cerebral palsy is $0.02$. This is the prior probability of the disease, $P(D)$.\n    $$P(D) = 0.02$$\n    From this, the probability of not having the disease is:\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$$\n2.  The sensitivity of the combined screening is $0.90$. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present.\n    $$P(T^+ | D) = 0.90$$\n3.  The specificity of the combined screening is $0.95$. Specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent.\n    $$P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$$\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test given that the disease is absent (the false positive rate). The events $T^+$ and $T^-$ are complementary for a given disease status. Therefore:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe goal is to compute the positive predictive value (PPV), which is defined as the probability that an infant has cerebral palsy given that the screening test is positive. In our notation, this is $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nHere, $P(D \\cap T^+)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive (a true positive). $P(T^+)$ is the overall probability of testing positive, regardless of disease status.\n\nWe can express the numerator, $P(D \\cap T^+)$, by rearranging the definition of conditional probability for $P(T^+|D)$:\n$$P(T^+ | D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(D)} \\implies P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) \\times P(D)$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, can be found using the Law of Total Probability. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: either the infant has the disease and tests positive (a true positive, $D \\cap T^+$), or the infant does not have the disease and tests positive (a false positive, $D^c \\cap T^+$).\n$$P(T^+) = P(D \\cap T^+) + P(D^c \\cap T^+)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term, we expand this to:\n$$P(T^+) = (P(T^+ | D) \\times P(D)) + (P(T^+ | D^c) \\times P(D^c))$$\n\nNow we substitute these expanded forms for the numerator and denominator back into the expression for PPV:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) \\times P(D)}{(P(T^+ | D) \\times P(D)) + (P(T^+ | D^c) \\times P(D^c))}$$\nThis formula is an expression of Bayes' Theorem, derived here from first principles as requested.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.90 \\times 0.02}{(0.90 \\times 0.02) + (0.05 \\times 0.98)}$$\n\nCalculate the terms:\nThe probability of a true positive result is the numerator:\n$$P(D \\cap T^+) = 0.90 \\times 0.02 = 0.018$$\nThe probability of a false positive result is the second term in the denominator's sum:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T^+) = 0.05 \\times 0.98 = 0.049$$\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.018 + 0.049 = 0.067$$\n\nFinally, we compute the PPV:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{0.018}{0.067}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.2686567...$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the PPV is $0.2687$.\n\nImplications for Counseling Families:\n\nThe calculated PPV of $0.2687$ means that for an infant in this high-risk cohort who receives a positive result on the combined screen, there is a $26.87\\%$ probability that they actually have cerebral palsy. This has several critical implications for counseling families.\n\n1.  **Contextualizing the Result**: The primary message is that a positive screen is an indicator of increased risk, **not** a definitive diagnosis. It is crucial to explain that a nearly $73\\%$ ($1 - 0.2687$) probability remains that the infant does *not* have cerebral palsy (i.e., the result is a false positive). This manages expectations and mitigates the immediate distress of a \"positive\" label.\n\n2.  **Justifying Further Diagnostics**: The screen is highly effective at risk stratification. It has increased the probability of disease from the baseline prevalence of $2\\%$ to nearly $27\\%$ for this subgroup, a more than $13$-fold increase in likelihood. This substantial increase in risk strongly warrants proceeding with more definitive, and often more invasive or costly, confirmatory diagnostic procedures, such as neuroimaging (e.g., MRI) and detailed longitudinal neurological examinations. The screen successfully identifies the subset of infants who would benefit most from this intensive follow-up.\n\n3.  **Guiding Proactive Early Management**: A $27\\%$ probability of cerebral palsy is a significant risk. Modern pediatric neurology emphasizes that the window for maximal neuroplasticity is in early infancy. Therefore, this result justifies the immediate initiation of early intervention services (such as targeted physical, occupational, and speech-language therapy) without waiting for a definitive diagnosis. The potential benefits of intervening early for a child who truly has cerebral palsy far outweigh the minimal harm or cost of providing services to a child who is ultimately found not to have the condition. Counseling should frame this as a proactive step to support the infant's optimal development, regardless of the final diagnosis.\n\n4.  **Emphasizing the Value of Screening**: The family should understand that even with a high false-positive rate, the screening program is performing its intended function. By identifying a smaller, highly enriched risk group from a larger pool of at-risk infants, it allows clinical resources to be focused efficiently and enables the early start of therapies that can significantly improve long-term functional outcomes for affected children.\n\nIn summary, counseling must be a careful balance of conveying the seriousness of the increased risk, managing the anxiety of uncertainty by clarifying that it is not a diagnosis, and empowering the family by outlining a clear, proactive plan for confirmatory diagnostics and early intervention.",

            "introduction": "Once a child is identified with CP, classifying their functional abilities is a critical next step for prognostication, communication, and planning. This exercise immerses you in this process, using the globally recognized Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and the context-specific Functional Mobility Scale (FMS). You will synthesize clinical data to assign the most appropriate GMFCS level, a cornerstone of modern CP management. More importantly, this practice requires you to construct a comprehensive, evidence-based set of functional goals, moving beyond a purely medical model to embrace a holistic, participation-focused approach consistent with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework .",

            "problem": "A clinician is asked to classify a child with Cerebral Palsy (CP) using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) and to formulate functional goals grounded in evidence-based pediatric rehabilitation. The child is an $8$-year-old with spastic diplegia, normal vision and hearing, and no significant intellectual disability. The Functional Mobility Scale (FMS) was administered as per its standardized protocol, which rates mobility across distances of $5$, $50$, and $500$ meters on an ordinal scale from $1$ to $6$, where $1$ indicates use of a wheelchair and larger scores reflect progressively less external support with $6$ indicating age-appropriate independent mobility on all surfaces. The child’s mobility pattern is as follows: at household distances the child primarily uses a posterior walker; the recorded FMS scores are $50 = 4$ (uses sticks/canes at school corridor distance) and $500 = 1$ (uses a wheelchair for community distances). There are no acute medical issues, and lower limb examinations show dynamic equinus bilaterally without fixed contractures. Orthoses are current, and the family reports fatigue limiting community participation.\n\nFundamental base for reasoning:\n- The GMFCS levels are a five-level system that classifies gross motor function based on typical performance in everyday settings without focusing on capacity under ideal conditions. Children at GMFCS level $3$ typically walk with a hand-held mobility device indoors and use wheeled mobility for longer distances; level $2$ typically walk without a hand-held device and may have limitations with community distances; level $4$ rely more on wheeled mobility and may achieve limited self-mobility with extensive support.\n- The FMS provides distance-specific snapshots of mobility demands; lower FMS scores at longer distances generally reflect higher energy costs and the need for more support, a principle consistent with pediatric gait energetics and participation demands.\n\nUsing these definitions and the observed mobility pattern, apply the crosswalk from FMS to GMFCS to select the most appropriate GMFCS level and construct a realistic, participation-focused set of functional goals consistent with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. Goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART), and should reflect typical performance, energy cost considerations, and necessary assistive technology.\n\nWhich option best aligns with the correct GMFCS level assignment and an appropriate $6$-month functional goal set?\n\nA. GMFCS level $3$; goals include: maintain and optimize household walking with a posterior walker (target $10$-meter gait speed increase by $10\\%$ and reduce $2$ falls per month to $0$); improve endurance with task-specific interval gait training to cover $50$ meters with sticks/canes at a rate improved by $10\\%$ without unsafe compensations; train independent manual wheelchair propulsion over $500$ meters with energy conservation strategies (Rate of Perceived Exertion $\\leq 4/10$); review and optimize ankle-foot orthoses; consider focal botulinum toxin for dynamic equinus combined with serial casting if indicated; implement hip surveillance per CP guidelines; develop a school travel plan (e.g., wheelchair for excursions) and caregiver training.\n\nB. GMFCS level $2$; goals include: discontinue all assistive devices and achieve independent walking at household, school, and community distances; progress to independent running over $500$ meters; eliminate wheelchair use; focus on sports participation as the primary intervention.\n\nC. GMFCS level $4$; goals include: transition to powered wheelchair as the primary mode for all settings; discontinue walking practice due to injury risk; avoid orthoses to encourage natural foot motion; plan for long-term caregiving without mobility training.\n\nD. GMFCS level $3$; goals include: eliminate the walker and sticks/canes to achieve independent community ambulation over $500$ meters; avoid wheelchair training to prevent “dependency”; set a single outcome of normalized gait pattern without assistive devices within $6$ months; defer spasticity management and orthoses adjustments until independence is achieved.",

The clinical presentation (spastic diplegia, dynamic equinus, fatigue) and the relationship between mobility devices, distance, and energy expenditure are all scientifically valid and consistent with clinical reality.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a specific clinical scenario with objective data (FMS scores, age, diagnosis) and standardized definitions (GMFCS levels). It asks for a two-part conclusion: a classification and a corresponding management plan. This structure allows for a unique, best-fit solution among the provided options based on logical deduction.\n-   **Objective**: The language is objective and clinical. The provided data are quantitative (age, FMS scores) or observational (mobility patterns, clinical findings). The task is to apply defined rules and principles, not to offer a subjective opinion.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The information is sufficient and internally consistent. The qualitative description (walker at home, canes at school, wheelchair for community) aligns perfectly with the quantitative FMS scores ($50\\text{m}=4$, $500\\text{m}=1$) and the clinical finding of fatigue. This forms a coherent clinical picture.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-constructed, scientifically sound clinical reasoning problem that is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires a two-step process: first, determining the correct GMFCS level, and second, evaluating the appropriateness of the proposed functional goals based on established principles of pediatric rehabilitation.\n\n**1. GMFCS Level Determination**\n\nThe GMFCS classifies a child's typical gross motor function in everyday settings. We will use the provided descriptions to classify the child.\n\n-   **Observed Mobility**:\n    -   Indoor/Household: Uses a posterior walker. This is a hand-held mobility device.\n    -   School ($50$ m): Uses sticks/canes. This is a hand-held mobility device.\n    -   Community ($500$ m): Uses a wheelchair. This is wheeled mobility.\n\n-   **Comparison with GMFCS Definitions**:\n    -   **GMFCS Level 2**: \"typically walk without a hand-held device\". This is inconsistent with the child's data, as they consistently use a hand-held device (walker or canes) for functional ambulation.\n    -   **GMFCS Level 3**: \"typically walk with a hand-held mobility device indoors and use wheeled mobility for longer distances\". This description precisely matches the child's mobility pattern across different environments.\n    -   **GMFCS Level 4**: \"rely more on wheeled mobility and may achieve limited self-mobility with extensive support\". While the child uses wheeled mobility for long distances, their functional ambulation with canes over a distance of $50$ meters suggests a higher functional level than is typical for GMFCS Level $4$, where walking is often limited to transfers or short distances with more substantial support.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate classification for this child is **GMFCS Level 3**. This limits the correct options to A and D.\n\n**2. Evaluation of Functional Goals**\n\nThe goals must be SMART, based on the ICF framework, and realistic for an $8$-year-old child at GMFCS Level $3$. The natural history for children at this level indicates that they will continue to require hand-held mobility devices and wheeled mobility into adulthood. Goals should focus on optimizing function and participation with these devices, not on eliminating them. The family's report of fatigue is a critical factor, emphasizing the need for energy conservation strategies.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. GMFCS level $3$; goals include: maintain and optimize household walking with a posterior walker (target $10$-meter gait speed increase by $10\\%$ and reduce $2$ falls per month to $0$); improve endurance with task-specific interval gait training to cover $50$ meters with sticks/canes at a rate improved by $10\\%$ without unsafe compensations; train independent manual wheelchair propulsion over $500$ meters with energy conservation strategies (Rate of Perceived Exertion $\\leq 4$/ $10$); review and optimize ankle-foot orthoses; consider focal botulinum toxin for dynamic equinus combined with serial casting if indicated; implement hip surveillance per CP guidelines; develop a school travel plan (e.g., wheelchair for excursions) and caregiver training.**\n\n-   **GMFCS Level**: Correct ($3$).\n-   **Goal Analysis**:\n    -   **Realism and Relevance**: The goals are highly realistic. They accept and aim to optimize the child's existing mobility methods (walker, canes, wheelchair), which is consistent with the evidence for GMFCS Level $3$. This is a \"mobility toolkit\" approach.\n    -   **ICF Framework**: The goals are comprehensive, addressing Body Structure/Function (orthoses, botulinum toxin for equinus, hip surveillance), Activity (gait speed, endurance, wheelchair propulsion), and Participation (school travel plan).\n    -   **SMART Criteria**: The goals are Specific and Measurable (e.g., \"$10\\%$ increase\", \"$0$ falls\", \"RPE $\\leq 4/10$\"). They are Achievable for a $6$-month timeframe. They are Relevant to the child's presentation, particularly the focus on endurance and energy conservation via wheelchair training to address fatigue.\n-   **Verdict**: This option presents a logical, evidence-based, and comprehensive plan that aligns perfectly with the child's classification and needs. **Correct.**\n\n**B. GMFCS level $2$; goals include: discontinue all assistive devices and achieve independent walking at household, school, and community distances; progress to independent running over $500$ meters; eliminate wheelchair use; focus on sports participation as the primary intervention.**\n\n-   **GMFCS Level**: Incorrect ($2$). The child's function does not match this level.\n-   **Goal Analysis**: The goals are completely unrealistic and inappropriate for an $8$-year-old at GMFCS Level $3$. Attempting to discontinue all devices and achieve independent running over $500$ meters is not achievable and sets the child up for failure. This approach ignores the underlying pathophysiology of CP and the known functional trajectories.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect.**\n\n**C. GMFCS level $4$; goals include: transition to powered wheelchair as the primary mode for all settings; discontinue walking practice due to injury risk; avoid orthoses to encourage natural foot motion; plan for long-term caregiving without mobility training.**\n\n-   **GMFCS Level**: Incorrect ($4$). The child is more functional than a typical Level $4$.\n-   **Goal Analysis**: These goals would represent a significant and unnecessary functional regression. Discontinuing walking for a child who can ambulate $50$ meters with canes is detrimental to their health (bone density, contracture prevention, cardiovascular health) and function. Avoiding orthoses is clinically contraindicated for managing dynamic equinus.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect.**\n\n**D. GMFCS level $3$; goals include: eliminate the walker and sticks/canes to achieve independent community ambulation over $500$ meters; avoid wheelchair training to prevent “dependency”; set a single outcome of normalized gait pattern without assistive devices within $6$ months; defer spasticity management and orthoses adjustments until independence is achieved.**\n\n-   **GMFCS Level**: Correct ($3$).\n-   **Goal Analysis**: While the GMFCS level is correct, the goals are profoundly flawed. They are unrealistic, reflecting an outdated \"normalization\" paradigm rather than a functional, participation-based one. For an $8$-year-old at GMFCS Level $3$, achieving independent ambulation over $500$ meters without devices in $6$ months is not an achievable goal. The concept of \"wheelchair dependency\" is a harmful myth; wheelchairs are enabling tools that conserve energy and promote participation. Deferring necessary medical management (spasticity, orthoses) is clinically negligent.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect.**",

The descriptions of normal gait, the pathophysiology of crouch gait, lever-arm dysfunction, and the function of specific muscles (hamstrings, rectus femoris) are all standard and factually correct within the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a comprehensive and detailed set of clinical and instrumented gait analysis data. This information is sufficient and necessary to formulate a logical surgical plan. The question asks for the most appropriate surgical prioritization, which can be determined by synthesizing the provided data.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and uses standard medical and biomechanical terminology. The data (e.g., $20^\\circ$ tilt, $25^\\circ$ flexion, $40^\\circ$ torsion) are objective measurements.\n- **Consistency and Completeness**: The data are internally consistent. For example, the severe external tibial torsion ($40^\\circ$ on CT) explains the large external foot progression angle ($+30^\\circ$). The hamstring tightness on physical exam (popliteal angle $60^\\circ$, fixed flexion contracture $10^\\circ$) and EMG (overactivity) correlates with the kinematic finding of crouch gait ($25^\\circ$ midstance knee flexion) and the kinetic finding of a knee flexion moment (GRF posterior to the knee). The problem is self-contained and does not have contradictory constraints.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It presents a realistic, scientifically grounded, and well-posed clinical scenario that can be solved by applying established principles of orthopedic biomechanics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe goal is to determine the most appropriate operative plan based on a synthesis of the provided data. The patient exhibits several interconnected gait deviations.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Sagittal Plane Deformities**:\n    - The patient has a **crouch gait**, defined by excessive knee flexion ($25^\\circ$) in midstance. The kinetic data confirm this, showing a reduced knee extension moment and a GRF vector posterior to the knee, which necessitates constant quadriceps firing to prevent collapse.\n    - The cause of the crouch is multifactorial, but the data point strongly to hamstring pathology. The clinical exam reveals a significant popliteal angle of $60^\\circ$ (indicating hamstring tightness) and a fixed knee flexion contracture of $10^\\circ$. The EMG confirms dynamic hamstring overactivity. Therefore, addressing the hamstrings is a primary requirement.\n    - The patient also has a persistent anterior pelvic tilt of $20^\\circ$. While this can be due to tight hip flexors (iliopsoas), it is very often a compensation to maintain an upright trunk in the presence of crouch gait. Lengthening the hamstrings will create a posterior tilting moment on the pelvis, which will help correct the anterior tilt.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Transverse Plane Deformities**:\n    - The patient presents with a severe out-toeing gait, with a foot progression angle of $+30^\\circ$.\n    - The underlying cause is identified as severe external tibial torsion, measured at $40^\\circ$ on CT scan. This is a significant bony deformity (normal in adults is approximately $15^\\circ-20^\\circ$).\n    - The problem statement explicitly highlights the consequence of this deformity: **lever-arm dysfunction**. The rotational malalignment prevents the ankle plantar flexors (calf muscles) from effectively generating a knee extension moment via the plantarflexion–knee extension couple. In a well-aligned limb, controlled plantarflexion in midstance pushes the GRF vector anterior to the knee, creating a passive extension moment. With $40^\\circ$ of external torsion, this mechanism is disabled, which actively contributes to and exacerbates the crouch gait.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Swing Phase Function**:\n    - The EMG data are critical: \"no prolonged rectus femoris activity during pre-swing or initial swing.\" This finding explicitly rules out the diagnosis of **stiff-knee gait**. Stiff-knee gait is characterized by reduced peak knee flexion in swing, caused by inappropriate activity of the rectus femoris (a hip flexor and knee extensor) during the swing phase.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Surgical Prioritization**:\n    - The patient has two major, interdependent problems driving the gait pathology: (1) hamstring contracture/overactivity causing crouch, and (2) severe external tibial torsion causing lever-arm dysfunction, which also contributes to crouch.\n    - Addressing only one of these problems is insufficient. If only hamstring lengthening is performed (unilevel surgery), the lever-arm dysfunction from the tibial torsion would remain, leading to a high likelihood of recurrent or persistent crouch. If only a tibial derotation osteotomy is performed, the fixed knee flexion contracture and dynamic hamstring overactivity would remain, preventing the patient from achieving full knee extension.\n    - The standard of care for complex, multilevel deformities in cerebral palsy is **Single-Event Multilevel Surgery (SEMLS)**. This approach addresses all significant bony and soft-tissue deformities in a single operative session to achieve a comprehensive correction and prevent the cycle of repeated surgeries.\n    - The logical SEMLS plan for this child must include:\n        - **Hamstring lengthening**: To correct the knee flexion contracture and reduce the dynamic flexion moment at the knee.\n        - **Bilateral tibial derotation osteotomy**: To correct the severe external torsion, realign the limb, and restore the plantarflexion-knee extension couple (i.e., fix the lever-arm dysfunction).\n    - The plan should explicitly *exclude* a rectus femoris transfer, as there is no EMG evidence for stiff-knee gait.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Prioritize rectus femoris transfer to improve knee flexion during swing**\n- This procedure is indicated for stiff-knee gait, which is caused by inappropriate rectus femoris activity during the swing phase. The EMG data explicitly state there is \"no prolonged rectus femoris activity during pre-swing or initial swing.\" Therefore, this procedure is not indicated and would be inappropriate.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Prioritize hamstring lengthening alone to correct crouch due to midstance knee flexion and accept rotational malalignment**\n- This plan addresses the hamstring pathology but completely ignores the severe ($40^\\circ$) external tibial torsion. As explained in the problem statement and the analysis above, this rotational malalignment causes significant lever-arm dysfunction, contributing to the crouch gait. Neglecting this bony deformity would lead to an incomplete correction and a high probability of failure.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Prioritize tibial derotation osteotomy alone to correct external torsion and defer hamstring surgery**\n- This plan addresses the bony malalignment but completely ignores the significant soft tissue pathology: a $10^\\circ$ fixed knee flexion contracture, a popliteal angle of $60^\\circ$, and EMG-confirmed hamstring overactivity. The crouch gait cannot be corrected in the face of this severe hamstring contracture, even with a restored lever arm.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Plan single-event multilevel surgery (SEMLS) with hamstring lengthening targeted to address midstance knee flexion and bilateral tibial derotation osteotomy to restore lever arms; avoid rectus femoris transfer because stiff-knee gait is not present**\n- This option proposes a comprehensive SEMLS plan that correctly identifies and targets the two primary pathologies: hamstring contracture/overactivity and external tibial torsion. It correctly identifies the goal of each procedure (hamstring lengthening for crouch; osteotomy for lever-arm restoration). It also correctly uses the EMG data to rule out an unnecessary rectus femoris transfer. This approach aligns perfectly with modern principles of CP management.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Perform iliopsoas lengthening to reduce anterior pelvic tilt while avoiding hamstring and tibial procedures**\n- This plan focuses on the anterior pelvic tilt, which is most likely a secondary compensation for the crouch gait. It completely ignores the primary problems at the knee (crouch) and in the transverse plane (torsion), which are the main drivers of the overall gait deviation. Performing only an iliopsoas lengthening would be a grave error, failing to address the fundamental sources of the disability.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
