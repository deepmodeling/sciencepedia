            "problem": "A pediatric clinician evaluating a $7$-year-old with suspected pediculosis capitis (head lice; Pediculus humanus capitis) knows that the developmental viability of louse eggs (nits) depends on thermal conditions near the scalp. In temperate indoor environments, nits observed within approximately $6$–$10$ mm of the scalp are clinically significant because they are more likely to be incubated at temperatures that permit embryonic development, whereas more distal nits are frequently nonviable or empty casings. To mechanistically connect this rule-of-thumb to heat transfer, consider the following scientifically grounded, simplified biothermal model.\n\nAssume:\n- The scalp surface is approximately isothermal at temperature $T_b = 34\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- The minimum temperature for viable nit development is $T_v = 27\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- The hair-bearing microenvironment immediately above the scalp can be modeled as a long, composite cylindrical “fin” composed of bundled hairs and sebum-air matrix, with effective diameter $D = 3.5$ mm and effective thermal conductivity $k = 0.25$ W$\\cdot$m$^{-1}\\cdot$K$^{-1}$.\n- The surrounding air provides convective cooling with coefficient $h = 2$ W$\\cdot$m$^{-2}\\cdot$K$^{-1}$ toward a spatially uniform ambient temperature $T_{\\infty}$.\n- The nit is small compared with scalp-to-nit distances of interest, and heat transfer along the bundle is one-dimensional along the axis orthogonal to the scalp. The distal end of the bundle can be treated as effectively “long” for steady state, so that the distal tip does not influence the local temperature profile near the scalp.\n\nStarting from Fourier’s law of conduction and Newton’s law of convective cooling, treat the composite hair bundle as a uniform cylindrical fin in steady state. Derive a general analytic expression for the critical distance $x_c(T_{\\infty})$ from the scalp at which the local hair-surface temperature equals the viability threshold, that is, where $T(x_c) = T_v$, in terms of $T_b$, $T_v$, $T_{\\infty}$, $h$, $k$, and $D$.\n\nThen, using your derived expression, compute the change in the critical viable nit-to-scalp distance, $\\Delta x = x_c(T_{\\infty,2}) - x_c(T_{\\infty,1})$, for a temperate indoor ambient warming from $T_{\\infty,1} = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $T_{\\infty,2} = 24\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.

We start by performing an energy balance on a differential element of the fin, of length $dx$, located at a distance $x$ from the scalp (the base of the fin).\n\nThe energy balance equation is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of heat conduction into element at } x = \\text{Rate of heat conduction out of element at } x+dx + \\text{Rate of heat convection from surface}\n$$\nIn mathematical terms:\n$$\nq_x = q_{x+dx} + dq_{\\text{conv}}\n$$\nAccording to Fourier's law of conduction, the rate of heat conduction is $q = -kA_c \\frac{dT}{dx}$, where $A_c$ is the cross-sectional area. The rate of heat convection is given by Newton's law of cooling, $dq_{\\text{conv}} = h(Pdx)(T(x) - T_{\\infty})$, where $P$ is the perimeter of the fin.\n\nThe energy balance becomes:\n$$\n-kA_c \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_x = -kA_c \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x+dx} + hPdx(T - T_{\\infty})\n$$\nRearranging and dividing by $dx$:\n$$\nk A_c \\frac{\\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_{x+dx} - \\frac{dT}{dx}\\big|_x}{dx} - hP(T - T_{\\infty}) = 0\n$$\nTaking the limit as $dx \\to 0$ gives the second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the fin:\n$$\nk A_c \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} - hP(T - T_{\\infty}) = 0\n$$\nTo simplify, we introduce an excess temperature variable $\\theta(x) = T(x) - T_{\\infty}$. Since $T_{\\infty}$ is a constant, $\\frac{dT}{dx} = \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}$ and $\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} - \\frac{hP}{kA_c}\\theta = 0\n$$\nWe define the fin parameter $m$ as $m^2 = \\frac{hP}{kA_c}$. The ODE is now in standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dx^2} - m^2\\theta = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this ODE is:\n$$\n\\theta(x) = C_1 \\exp(mx) + C_2 \\exp(-mx)\n$$\nWe apply the boundary conditions to find the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n1.  At the base of the fin ($x=0$), the temperature is the scalp temperature, $T(0) = T_b$. In terms of $\\theta$, this is $\\theta(0) = T_b - T_{\\infty}$.\n2.  The problem states the bundle can be treated as \"effectively long\". This corresponds to the boundary condition for an infinitely long fin, where the temperature at the tip approaches the ambient temperature, $T(x \\to \\infty) = T_{\\infty}$. In terms of $\\theta$, this is $\\theta(x \\to \\infty) = 0$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$\n\\theta(\\infty) = C_1 \\exp(m \\cdot \\infty) + C_2 \\exp(-m \\cdot \\infty) = 0\n$$\nSince $m0$, $\\exp(m \\cdot \\infty) \\to \\infty$. For the equation to hold, the coefficient $C_1$ must be zero. Thus, $C_1 = 0$.\nThe solution simplifies to $\\theta(x) = C_2 \\exp(-mx)$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$\n\\theta(0) = C_2 \\exp(0) = C_2 = T_b - T_{\\infty}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back, the specific solution for the excess temperature is:\n$$\n\\theta(x) = (T_b - T_{\\infty}) \\exp(-mx)\n$$\nConverting back to the actual temperature $T(x)$:\n$$\nT(x) - T_{\\infty} = (T_b - T_{\\infty}) \\exp(-mx) \\implies T(x) = T_{\\infty} + (T_b - T_{\\infty}) \\exp(-mx)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the critical distance $x_c$ at which $T(x_c) = T_v$. We set $T(x) = T_v$ and $x = x_c$:\n$$\nT_v = T_{\\infty} + (T_b - T_{\\infty}) \\exp(-mx_c)\n$$\nNow we solve for $x_c$:\n$$\nT_v - T_{\\infty} = (T_b - T_{\\infty}) \\exp(-mx_c)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{T_v - T_{\\infty}}{T_b - T_{\\infty}} = \\exp(-mx_c)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_v - T_{\\infty}}{T_b - T_{\\infty}}\\right) = -mx_c\n$$\n$$\nx_c = -\\frac{1}{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_v - T_{\\infty}}{T_b - T_{\\infty}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{m} \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{T_v - T_{\\infty}}{T_b - T_{\\infty}}\\right)^{-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nx_c = \\frac{1}{m} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_b - T_{\\infty}}{T_v - T_{\\infty}}\\right)\n$$\nThe parameter $m$ depends on the geometry and material properties. For a cylindrical fin of diameter $D$, the perimeter is $P = \\pi D$ and the cross-sectional area is $A_c = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$.\n$$\nm = \\sqrt{\\frac{hP}{kA_c}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{h(\\pi D)}{k(\\pi D^2/4)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4h}{kD}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{D}} \\sqrt{\\frac{h}{k}}\n$$\nSubstituting $m$ into the expression for $x_c$ yields the general analytic expression:\n$$\nx_c(T_{\\infty}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{kD}}{2\\sqrt{h}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_b - T_{\\infty}}{T_v - T_{\\infty}}\\right)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must calculate the change in critical distance, $\\Delta x = x_c(T_{\\infty,2}) - x_c(T_{\\infty,1})$, as the ambient temperature warms from $T_{\\infty,1} = 20\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ to $T_{\\infty,2} = 24\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nLet's define the constant pre-factor:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\sqrt{kD}}{2\\sqrt{h}}\n$$\nThen, $x_c(T_{\\infty}) = C \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_b - T_{\\infty}}{T_v - T_{\\infty}}\\right)$.\nThe change $\\Delta x$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta x = x_c(T_{\\infty,2}) - x_c(T_{\\infty,1}) = C \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_b - T_{\\infty,2}}{T_v - T_{\\infty,2}}\\right) - C \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_b - T_{\\infty,1}}{T_v - T_{\\infty,1}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic property $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\n\\Delta x = C \\ln\\left[ \\frac{(T_b - T_{\\infty,2}) / (T_v - T_{\\infty,2})}{(T_b - T_{\\infty,1}) / (T_v - T_{\\infty,1})} \\right] = C \\ln\\left[ \\frac{(T_b - T_{\\infty,2})(T_v - T_{\\infty,1})}{(T_v - T_{\\infty,2})(T_b - T_{\\infty,1})} \\right]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values.

            "problem": "A pediatric index patient is diagnosed with scabies caused by Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis. In households, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infestation is common due to the incubation period, and skin-to-skin contact drives transmission. Standard practice in pediatrics is to treat all household contacts simultaneously, regardless of symptoms, to prevent reinfestation and onward spread. Using a mechanistic, epidemiological first-principles framework based on independent Poisson transmission processes, justify the recommendation to treat all contacts simultaneously, and then quantify the expected decrease in first-generation secondary cases in a household under full compliance compared to partial adherence.\n\nAssume the following scientifically realistic and self-consistent parameters:\n\n- Household size is $n = 6$ (one index patient and $n-1 = 5$ household contacts).\n- The proportion of household contacts already infested (asymptomatic or symptomatic) at the time of the index case’s diagnosis is $\\pi = 0.4$, so the number of susceptible contacts is $(n-1)(1-\\pi)$ in expectation.\n- For any infectious–susceptible household dyad, the instantaneous transmission rate is constant at $\\beta = 0.04$ per day, and transmission events are modeled as a Poisson process.\n- Without treatment, an infectious individual remains infectious for $D_{u} = 21$ days on average.\n- With effective treatment applied at time $t = 0$, infectiousness declines rapidly and is taken to be negligible after $\\tau = 1$ day.\n- The index patient is treated at $t = 0$ in both scenarios.\n- Under full compliance, all contacts are treated at $t = 0$.\n- Under partial adherence, only a fraction $q = 0.5$ of contacts are treated at $t = 0$; the remainder receive no treatment.\n\nUse the following first-principles epidemiological base:\n\n- Independent Poisson transmission: for a given infectious–susceptible dyad with constant rate $\\beta$ over an exposure duration $T$, the probability of transmission is $1 - \\exp(-\\beta T)$.\n- Additivity of hazards across independent sources: for one susceptible exposed to $k$ independent infectious sources with exposure durations $T_{1}, \\dots, T_{k}$ at rate $\\beta$, the cumulative hazard is $\\beta \\sum_{j=1}^{k} T_{j}$ and the probability of at least one transmission is $1 - \\exp\\!\\big(-\\beta \\sum_{j=1}^{k} T_{j}\\big)$.\n- Expected values over binomial variability: the expected number of already infested contacts at $t=0$ is $(n-1)\\pi$, and the expected number of susceptible contacts is $(n-1)(1-\\pi)$; with partial adherence, the expected number of treated infested contacts is $(n-1)\\pi q$ and untreated infested contacts is $(n-1)\\pi(1-q)$.\n\nTasks:\n\n1.

Express the final quantity as a number of cases per household (no units in the boxed final answer).",
            "solution": "The solution is structured to address the three tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\nThe number of household contacts is $n-1 = 6-1 = 5$. At time $t=0$, we use the expectation values for the number of contacts in each state.\nThe expected number of susceptible contacts is $S_0 = (n-1)(1-\\pi) = 5(1-0.4) = 3$.\nThe expected number of already infested (and infectious) contacts is $I_0 = (n-1)\\pi = 5(0.4) = 2$.\nThese infested contacts, along with the index patient, are the sources of new infections after $t=0$. The $S_0$ susceptible contacts are the population at risk of becoming first-generation secondary cases.\n\n### Task 1: Justification for Simultaneous Treatment\nThe justification for simultaneous treatment of all household contacts stems from the goal of minimizing the total household infectious burden to prevent new transmissions. The probability that a susceptible individual becomes infected is a monotonically increasing function of the cumulative hazard they are exposed to. The cumulative hazard is the sum of hazards from all infectious sources. For a single susceptible individual, this hazard, $\\Lambda$, is given by $\\Lambda = \\beta \\sum_{j} T_{j}$, where the sum is over all infectious individuals $j$ in the household, and $T_j$ is the duration for which individual $j$ is infectious.\n\nWithout treatment, an infested contact remains infectious for a duration $D_u = 21$ days. With treatment, this duration is reduced to $\\tau = 1$ day. At $t=0$, there is an expected number of $I_0 = (n-1)\\pi$ contacts who are already infested but may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. These individuals constitute a hidden reservoir of infection.\n\nIf these $I_0$ contacts are not treated, they each contribute a term proportional to $\\beta D_u$ to the cumulative hazard. If they are treated, their contribution is reduced to a term proportional to $\\beta \\tau$. Given $D_u \\gg \\tau$ (specifically, $21$ versus $1$), not treating these contacts results in a substantially larger cumulative hazard exerted on the susceptible members of the household. This translates to a much higher probability of transmission and, consequently, a higher expected number of secondary cases. Simultaneous treatment of all contacts, regardless of symptoms, is therefore the most effective strategy to rapidly eliminate all sources of infection (both known and hidden) and break the chain of transmission within the household.\n\n### Task 2: Computation of Expected Secondary Cases\n\nWe calculate the expected number of new (secondary) cases, $E[\\text{Cases}]$, by multiplying the number of susceptible individuals, $S_0$, by the probability that a single susceptible individual becomes infected, $P_{\\text{inf}}$. This probability is $P_{\\text{inf}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda)$, where $\\Lambda$ is the total cumulative hazard from all infectious sources.\n\nThe sources of infection are the index patient (always treated, infectious for duration $\\tau$) and the $I_0$ initially infested contacts.\n\n**Scenario 1: Full Compliance**\nUnder full compliance, all $I_0$ infested contacts are treated at $t=0$, so each is infectious for a duration $\\tau$. The total number of infectious sources is $1$ (the index patient) plus the expected $I_0=2$ infested contacts.\nThe cumulative hazard, $\\Lambda_{\\text{full}}$, on a single susceptible person is the sum of hazards from the index patient and all $I_0$ infested contacts:\n$\\Lambda_{\\text{full}} = \\beta \\tau + I_0 \\beta \\tau = (1 + I_0) \\beta \\tau$\n$\\Lambda_{\\text{full}} = (1 + (n-1)\\pi) \\beta \\tau$\nSubstituting the values:\n$\\Lambda_{\\text{full}} = (1 + 2) \\times 0.04 \\times 1 = 3 \\times 0.04 = 0.12$\n\nThe probability of a susceptible person becoming infected is:\n$P_{\\text{inf, full}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda_{\\text{full}}) = 1 - \\exp(-0.12)$\n\nThe expected number of secondary cases, $E_{\\text{full}}$, is:\n$E_{\\text{full}} = S_0 \\times P_{\\text{inf, full}} = (n-1)(1-\\pi) \\left[ 1 - \\exp(-(1 + (n-1)\\pi) \\beta \\tau) \\right]$\n$E_{\\text{full}} = 3 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.12) \\right) \\approx 3 \\times (1 - 0.886920) = 3 \\times 0.113080 = 0.33924$\n\n**Scenario 2: Partial Adherence**\nUnder partial adherence, a fraction $q=0.5$ of contacts are treated. This means, in expectation, $I_0 q$ of the infested contacts are treated and remain infectious for duration $\\tau$, while $I_0(1-q)$ are untreated and remain infectious for duration $D_u$. The index patient is still treated and is infectious for duration $\\tau$.\n\nThe cumulative hazard, $\\Lambda_{\\text{part}}$, on a single susceptible person is:\n$\\Lambda_{\\text{part}} = \\underbrace{\\beta \\tau}_{\\text{from index case}} + \\underbrace{(I_0 q) \\beta \\tau}_{\\text{from treated contacts}} + \\underbrace{I_0(1-q) \\beta D_u}_{\\text{from untreated contacts}}$\n$\\Lambda_{\\text{part}} = \\beta \\left( \\tau + I_0 q \\tau + I_0(1-q)D_u \\right)$\n$\\Lambda_{\\text{part}} = \\beta \\left( (1 + (n-1)\\pi q)\\tau + (n-1)\\pi(1-q)D_u \\right)$\nSubstituting the values:\n$I_0 q = 2 \\times 0.5 = 1$\n$I_0(1-q) = 2 \\times (1-0.5) = 1$\n$\\Lambda_{\\text{part}} = 0.04 \\times (1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 1 + 1 \\times 21) = 0.04 \\times (1 + 1 + 21) = 0.04 \\times 23 = 0.92$\n\nThe probability of a susceptible person becoming infected is:\n$P_{\\text{inf, part}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda_{\\text{part}}) = 1 - \\exp(-0.92)$\n\nThe expected number of secondary cases, $E_{\\text{part}}$, is:\n$E_{\\text{part}} = S_0 \\times P_{\\text{inf, part}} = (n-1)(1-\\pi) \\left[ 1 - \\exp(-\\Lambda_{\\text{part}}) \\right]$\n$E_{\\text{part}} = 3 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.92) \\right) \\approx 3 \\times (1 - 0.398519) = 3 \\times 0.601481 = 1.80444$\n\n### Task 3: Expected Decrease in Secondary Cases\nThe expected decrease in first-generation secondary cases under full compliance compared to partial adherence is the difference $E_{\\text{part}} - E_{\\text{full}}$.\n\n$\\Delta E = E_{\\text{part}} - E_{\\text{full}}$\n$\\Delta E = 3 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.92) \\right) - 3 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.12) \\right)$\n$\\Delta E = 3 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.92) - 1 + \\exp(-0.12) \\right)$\n$\\Delta E = 3 \\left( \\exp(-0.12) - \\exp(-0.92) \\right)$\n$\\Delta E \\approx 3 \\times (0.8869204 - 0.3985191) = 3 \\times 0.4884013 = 1.4652039$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, the expected decrease is $1.465$.",
