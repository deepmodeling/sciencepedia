            "solution": "The Principle of Virtual Work (PVW) in the reference configuration asserts that the internal virtual work, $\\delta W_{int}$, is equal to the external virtual work, $\\delta W_{ext}$, for any kinematically admissible virtual displacement field. This principle is expressed as:\n$$\n\\delta W_{int} = \\delta W_{ext}\n$$\nThe problem considers a one-dimensional bar of reference length $L_0$ and reference cross-sectional area $A_0$. We will formulate the expressions for both internal and external virtual work for this system.\n\nFirst, we address the internal virtual work, $\\delta W_{int}$. The problem specifies that the internal virtual work density (virtual work per unit reference volume) is $S_E \\delta E$, where $S_E$ is the stress measure work-conjugate to the given strain measure $E(\\lambda)$. The total internal virtual work is the integral of this density over the entire reference volume $V_0 = A_0 L_0$:\n$$\n\\delta W_{int} = \\int_{V_0} S_E \\delta E \\, dV_0\n$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the axial stretch $\\lambda$ is uniform throughout the bar. This implies that the strain $E$, being a function of $\\lambda$ only, is also uniform. Consequently, its variation, $\\delta E$, and the work-conjugate stress, $S_E$, are also constant throughout the volume $V_0$. We can therefore move these quantities outside the integral:\n$$\n\\delta W_{int} = S_E \\delta E \\int_{V_0} dV_0 = S_E \\delta E (A_0 L_0)\n$$\n\nNext, we formulate the external virtual work, $\\delta W_{ext}$. The only external force acting on the body is the prescribed axial traction $\\bar{t}_0$ at the free end. This traction is defined per unit reference area $A_0$. Thus, the total axial force, $F$, applied at the free end is:\n$$\nF = \\bar{t}_0 A_0\n$$\nThe displacement of the free end of the bar is $u = L - L_0$, where $L$ is the current length. The virtual work done by the force $F$ is its product with the corresponding virtual displacement, $\\delta u$. Since body forces are ignored, this constitutes the total external virtual work:\n$$\n\\delta W_{ext} = F \\delta u = (\\bar{t}_0 A_0) \\delta u\n$$\n\nTo proceed, we must connect the virtual quantities $\\delta E$ and $\\delta u$ through the problem's kinematics. The axial stretch is defined as $\\lambda = \\frac{L}{L_0}$. The current length $L$ can be expressed in terms of the end displacement $u$ as $L = L_0 + u$. Substituting this into the definition of stretch, we get:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{L_0 + u}{L_0} = 1 + \\frac{u}{L_0}\n$$\nTaking the variation of this expression yields the virtual stretch $\\delta \\lambda$. Since $L_0$ is a constant, we have:\n$$\n\\delta \\lambda = \\delta \\left(1 + \\frac{u}{L_0}\\right) = \\frac{\\delta u}{L_0}\n$$\nThe strain measure is given as $E(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{p}(\\lambda^p - 1)$. The virtual strain $\\delta E$ is related to the virtual stretch $\\delta \\lambda$ by the chain rule:\n$$\n\\delta E = \\frac{dE}{d\\lambda} \\delta \\lambda\n$$\nWe compute the derivative of $E$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{dE}{d\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left[\\frac{1}{p}(\\lambda^p - 1)\\right] = \\frac{1}{p}(p \\lambda^{p-1}) = \\lambda^{p-1}\n$$\nSubstituting this result gives the expression for the virtual strain:\n$$\n\\delta E = \\lambda^{p-1} \\delta \\lambda\n$$\nNow, we express $\\delta E$ in terms of the virtual displacement $\\delta u$ by substituting the relation $\\delta \\lambda = \\frac{\\delta u}{L_0}$:\n$$\n\\delta E = \\lambda^{p-1} \\left(\\frac{\\delta u}{L_0}\\right)\n$$\n\nWith all components defined, we return to the Principle of Virtual Work, $\\delta W_{int} = \\delta W_{ext}$:\n$$\nS_E \\delta E (A_0 L_0) = (\\bar{t}_0 A_0) \\delta u\n$$\nWe substitute the derived expression for $\\delta E$ into this equation:\n$$\nS_E \\left(\\lambda^{p-1} \\frac{\\delta u}{L_0}\\right) (A_0 L_0) = \\bar{t}_0 A_0 \\delta u\n$$\nThe reference length $L_0$ in the numerator and denominator on the left-hand side cancels out:\n$$\nS_E \\lambda^{p-1} \\delta u A_0 = \\bar{t}_0 A_0 \\delta u\n$$\nThe PVW must hold for any arbitrary, non-zero, kinematically admissible virtual displacement $\\delta u$. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by the term $A_0 \\delta u$ (since $A_0 > 0$ and $\\delta u$ is arbitrary):\n$$\nS_E \\lambda^{p-1} = \\bar{t}_0\n$$\nFinally, we solve for the stress measure $S_E$ by dividing by $\\lambda^{p-1}$:\n$$\nS_E = \\frac{\\bar{t}_0}{\\lambda^{p-1}}\n$$\nThis expression can be rewritten using a negative exponent as:\n$$\nS_E = \\bar{t}_0 \\lambda^{1-p}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the stress measure $S_E$ as a function of the applied traction $\\bar{t}_0$, the stretch $\\lambda$, and the material parameter $p$.",

The tetrahedron has nodal coordinates in millimeters given by node 1 at $(0,0,0)$, node 2 at $(1,0,0)$, node 3 at $(0,2,0)$, and node 4 at $(0,0,3)$. The tissue is modeled as a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic solid with Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$, both constant over the element.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of the normalized Frobenius error, $R$, between the exact element stiffness matrix and its approximation using one-point Gaussian quadrature for a linear four-node tetrahedral element.\n\nThe element stiffness matrix, $\\mathbf{K}_e$, is defined by the integral over the element volume $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_e = \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{B}$ is the strain-displacement matrix and $\\mathbf{C}$ is the constitutive matrix for the material.\n\nThe problem states that the element is a linear four-node tetrahedron. For such an element, the displacement field $\\mathbf{u}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ at a point $\\boldsymbol{x} = (x, y, z)^T$ is interpolated from the nodal displacement vector $\\mathbf{d}$ using linear shape functions $N_i(\\boldsymbol{x})$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} N_i(\\boldsymbol{x})\\mathbf{u}_i = \\mathbf{N}(\\boldsymbol{x})\\mathbf{d}\n$$\nThe shape functions for a linear tetrahedron are linear functions of the spatial coordinates, having the general form:\n$$\nN_i(x, y, z) = a_i + b_i x + c_i y + d_i z\n$$\nThe coefficients $a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i$ are constants determined by the nodal coordinates of the tetrahedron.\n\nIn small-strain elasticity, the strain vector $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is obtained by taking the spatial derivatives of the displacement field components. This relationship is captured by the strain-displacement matrix $\\mathbf{B}$, such that $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{d}$. The components of the $\\mathbf{B}$ matrix are constructed from the spatial derivatives of the shape functions. For example, for a nodal displacement $u_{ix}$ (the $x$-displacement of node $i$), its contribution to the normal strain $\\epsilon_{xx}$ is via the term $\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} u_{ix}$.\n\nThe derivatives of the linear shape functions are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial x} = b_i\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial y} = c_i\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial N_i}{\\partial z} = d_i\n$$\nSince the coefficients $b_i, c_i, d_i$ are constants for a given element geometry, all spatial derivatives of the shape functions are constant throughout the element. Consequently, the strain-displacement matrix $\\mathbf{B}$, which is composed of these derivatives, is a constant matrix. It does not vary with the position $\\boldsymbol{x}$ within the element $\\Omega$. This is a fundamental property of the linear tetrahedral element, which is why it is often referred to as a Constant Strain Tetrahedron (CST).\n\nThe problem states that the material is homogeneous, meaning its properties, Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$, are constant over the element. Therefore, the constitutive matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is also constant throughout the element.\n\nGiven that both $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{C}$ are constant matrices, the integrand of the stiffness matrix, $\\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B}$, is also a constant matrix with respect to the integration variable $\\boldsymbol{x}$.\n\nLet us now evaluate the exact integral for the stiffness matrix, $\\mathbf{K}_e$. Since the integrand is constant, we can take it outside the integral:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_e = \\int_{\\Omega} (\\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = (\\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B}) \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = |\\Omega| (\\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B})\n$$\nwhere $|\\Omega|$ is the volume of the tetrahedral element. The nodal coordinates provided, node $1$ at $(0,0,0)$, node $2$ at $(1,0,0)$, node $3$ at $(0,2,0)$, and node $4$ at $(0,0,3)$, define a non-degenerate tetrahedron. Its volume can be calculated as $|\\Omega| = \\frac{1}{6} |\\det(\\mathbf{J})|$, where $\\mathbf{J}$ is the matrix formed by the vectors from one vertex to the other three. With node $1$ at the origin, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe volume is $|\\Omega| = \\frac{1}{6} |1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3| = \\frac{6}{6} = 1$ mm$^3$. Since $|\\Omega| \\neq 0$, the element is not degenerate.\n\nNext, we evaluate the stiffness matrix using one-point Gaussian quadrature at the element centroid $\\boldsymbol{x}_c$. The formula is given as:\n$$\n\\left(\\mathbf{K}_e\\right)_{\\text{1-pt}} = \\left(\\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Omega\\right)_{\\text{1-pt}} = |\\Omega|\\,\\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol{x}_{c}) = |\\Omega|\\,(\\mathbf{B}(\\boldsymbol{x}_c)^{T}\\,\\mathbf{C}\\,\\mathbf{B}(\\boldsymbol{x}_c))\n$$\nHowever, we have already established that the integrand $\\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B}$ is a constant matrix. Its value at the centroid $\\boldsymbol{x}_c$ is the same as its value at any other point in the element. Therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol{x}_c) = \\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the quadrature formula gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\mathbf{K}_e\\right)_{\\text{1-pt}} = |\\Omega| (\\mathbf{B}^{T}\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B})\n$$\nComparing the exact stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_e$ with its one-point quadrature approximation $(\\mathbf{K}_e)_{\\text{1-pt}}$, we find that they are identical:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}_e = \\left(\\mathbf{K}_e\\right)_{\\text{1-pt}}\n$$\nThis result is expected, as one-point Gaussian quadrature is exact for integrating any constant function over the domain.\n\nThe problem requires us to compute the normalized Frobenius error, $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left\\|\\mathbf{K}_e - \\left(\\mathbf{K}_e\\right)_{\\text{1-pt}}\\right\\|_{F}}{\\left\\|\\mathbf{K}_e\\right\\|_{F}}\n$$\nThe numerator is the Frobenius norm of the difference between the two matrices. Since the matrices are identical, their difference is the zero matrix:\n$$\n\\left\\|\\mathbf{K}_e - \\left(\\mathbf{K}_e\\right)_{\\text{1-pt}}\\right\\|_{F} = \\left\\|\\mathbf{0}\\right\\|_{F} = 0\n$$\nThe denominator is the Frobenius norm of the exact stiffness matrix, $\\|\\mathbf{K}_e\\|_F$. For a non-degenerate element and a physically realistic material (where $\\mathbf{C}$ is positive definite), the stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}_e = |\\Omega|\\mathbf{B}^T\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{B}$ is a non-zero, positive semi-definite matrix. Therefore, its Frobenius norm is strictly positive: $\\|\\mathbf{K}_e\\|_F > 0$.\n\nThe error $R$ is thus:\n$$\nR = \\frac{0}{\\|\\mathbf{K}_e\\|_F} = 0\n$$\nThe explicit values of the nodal coordinates, Young's modulus $E$, and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ are not necessary to arrive at this conclusion, as the result stems from the fundamental properties of the linear tetrahedral element itself. The one-point integration scheme is exact for this element type.",

A differential volume element $d\\xi d\\eta d\\zeta$ in the parent element maps to a volume $dV = J d\\xi d\\eta d\\zeta$ in the physical element.\nThe parent element, defined in the $(\\xi,\\eta,\\zeta)$ space, is a right-handed coordinate system with a positive volume by convention. A positive Jacobian ($J>0$) signifies that the mapping preserves the orientation, meaning a right-handed basis in the parent space maps to a right-handed basis in the physical space. This corresponds to a physically admissible deformation.\nA negative Jacobian ($J<0$), as found in this problem ($J=-120$), signifies an orientation-reversing mapping. The element has been \"turned inside-out\" or inverted. This is analogous to a right-hand glove being turned into a left-hand glove.\nIn the context of continuum mechanics for soft tissues:\n1.  **Physical Impossibility**: $J<0$ implies a negative volume, which is physically impossible. It represents a state where the material has interpenetrated itself. Such a configuration cannot be reached by a continuous deformation of a real physical body. The final nodal configuration, while geometrically a valid prism, is inverted relative to the standard node numbering of the parent element (specifically, the ordering in the $z$-direction is reversed relative to the $\\zeta$-direction).\n2.  **Numerical Failure**: In a large-deformation analysis, which is typically solved incrementally, a state where $J \\le 0$ at any integration point will usually cause the numerical simulation to fail. The element stiffness matrix becomes non-positive-definite, and the nonlinear equation solver (like Newton-Raphson) will fail to converge.\n3.  **Constitutive Model Violation**: The constitutive laws (stress-strain relationships) for soft tissues are often formulated using hyperelastic models. These models define a strain energy density function, which frequently includes a term that acts as a barrier to prevent volume compression to zero, such as a logarithmic term involving $J$ (e.g., $U(J) \\propto (\\ln J)^2$). Such functions are undefined for $J \\le 0$. A negative Jacobian represents a state that is fundamentally inconsistent with the mathematical models used to describe material behavior.\n\nIn summary, a negative Jacobian indicates a locally inverted element, which is a non-physical state that leads to the termination of a typical FEM simulation.",
