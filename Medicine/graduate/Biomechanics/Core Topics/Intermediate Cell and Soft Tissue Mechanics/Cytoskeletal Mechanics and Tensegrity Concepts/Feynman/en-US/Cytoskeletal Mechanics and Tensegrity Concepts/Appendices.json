            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of critical buckling loads for an Euler-Bernoulli beam under two different sets of boundary conditions, using the principle of total potential energy. The beam represents a cytoskeletal filament.\n\nThe total potential energy, $\\Pi$, of a beam under an axial compressive load $F$ is the sum of the elastic strain energy stored in bending, $U_b$, and the potential energy of the external load, $V_F$.\n\nFor an Euler-Bernoulli beam with small deflections $y(x)$, the curvature is approximated by $y''(x) = \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$. The bending strain energy is given by:\n$$U_b = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\kappa \\left( \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \\right)^2 dx$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the bending stiffness and $L$ is the length of the beam.\n\nThe axial shortening of the beam due to transverse deflection $y(x)$ is given by $\\Delta L = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left( \\frac{dy}{dx} \\right)^2 dx$. The work done by the compressive force $F$ is $F \\Delta L$, which corresponds to a loss in potential energy of the loading system.

For a non-trivial solution (i.e., for buckling to occur), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n$$\\begin{vmatrix} \\sin(kL) - kL & \\cos(kL) - 1 \\\\ \\cos(kL) - 1 & -\\sin(kL) \\end{vmatrix} = 0$$\n$$-\\sin(kL)(\\sin(kL) - kL) - (\\cos(kL) - 1)^2 = 0$$\n$$-\\sin^2(kL) + kL\\sin(kL) - (\\cos^2(kL) - 2\\cos(kL) + 1) = 0$$\n$$-(\\sin^2(kL) + \\cos^2(kL)) + kL\\sin(kL) + 2\\cos(kL) - 1 = 0$$\n$$-1 + kL\\sin(kL) + 2\\cos(kL) - 1 = 0$$\n$$kL\\sin(kL) + 2\\cos(kL) - 2 = 0$$\nThis is the transcendental buckling condition. To solve it, we use half-angle identities. Let $\\alpha = kL$. The equation is $\\alpha\\sin(\\alpha) + 2\\cos(\\alpha) - 2 = 0$.\nUsing $\\sin(\\alpha) = 2\\sin(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\alpha/2)$ and $1-\\cos(\\alpha) = 2\\sin^2(\\alpha/2)$:\n$$\\alpha(2\\sin(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\alpha/2)) - 2(1 - \\cos(\\alpha)) = 0$$\n$$2\\alpha\\sin(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\alpha/2) - 4\\sin^2(\\alpha/2) = 0$$\n$$2\\sin(\\alpha/2)[\\alpha\\cos(\\alpha/2) - 2\\sin(\\alpha/2)] = 0$$\nThis gives two families of solutions:\n1. $\\sin(\\alpha/2) = 0 \\implies \\alpha/2 = n\\pi \\implies \\alpha = kL = 2n\\pi$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n2. $\\alpha\\cos(\\alpha/2) - 2\\sin(\\alpha/2) = 0 \\implies \\tan(\\alpha/2) = \\alpha/2$.\n\nLet's find the smallest non-zero root for $\\alpha = kL$.\nFrom the first family, the smallest positive root is for $n=1$, giving $\\alpha = 2\\pi$.\nFrom the second family, we seek the smallest positive root of $\\tan(\\beta) = \\beta$ where $\\beta = \\alpha/2$. The trivial root is $\\beta=0$ ($\\alpha=0$). The first non-trivial positive root occurs in the interval $(\\pi, 3\\pi/2)$. Its value is approximately $\\beta \\approx 4.4934$, which gives $\\alpha = 2\\beta \\approx 8.9868$.\nComparing the smallest positive roots from both families, $2\\pi \\approx 6.2832$ and $8.9868$, the smaller value is $2\\pi$.\nThus, the smallest value of $kL$ that satisfies the buckling condition is $kL = 2\\pi$.\nThe critical load is found by substituting this value:\n$$k_c = \\frac{2\\pi}{L} \\implies F_{c,\\text{clamped}} = k_c^2 \\kappa = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\kappa = \\frac{4\\pi^2\\kappa}{L^2}$$\n\n**Ratio of Critical Loads**\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the critical load for the clamped-clamped case to that of the pinned-pinned case:\n$$\\frac{F_{c,\\text{clamped}}}{F_{c,\\text{pinned}}} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\pi^2\\kappa}{L^2}}{\\frac{\\pi^2\\kappa}{L^2}}$$\nThe terms $\\pi^2$, $\\kappa$, and $L^2$ cancel out.\n$$\\frac{F_{c,\\text{clamped}}}{F_{c,\\text{pinned}}} = 4$$\nThis result indicates that a filament with clamped ends is four times more resistant to buckling under axial compression than one with pinned ends.",

For each test case $(\\text{removed}, E_c A_c, E_s A_s, T_c, N_s)$:\n   - Initialize the global stiffness $\\mathbf{K}$ of size $10\\times 10$ (five nodes times two degrees of freedom).\n   - For each member $e=(i,j)$:\n     - If $e$ is a cable and $e\\in\\text{removed}$, skip it.\n     - Compute $L=\\|\\mathbf{x}_j-\\mathbf{x}_i\\|$ and $\\mathbf{t}=(\\mathbf{x}_j-\\mathbf{x}_i)/L$.\n     - Set $E A=E_c A_c$ for cables and $E A=E_s A_s$ for the strut.\n     - Set $N=T_c$ for cables and $N=N_s$ for the strut.\n     - Form $\\mathbf{K}_m^{(e)}$ and $\\mathbf{K}_g^{(e)}$ using the expressions above, and assemble into $\\mathbf{K}$.\n   - Extract the free-free submatrix $\\mathbf{K}_{ff}$ corresponding to nodes $2$, $4$, and $5$.\n   - Compute the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{K}_{ff}$, determine $\\lambda_{\\min}$, count soft modes $n_{\\text{soft}}$ with $0\\le \\lambda_k \\le \\epsilon$, and count unstable modes $n_{\\text{unstable}}$ with $\\lambda_k<0$.\n4. Report for each case the list $[\\lambda_{\\min}, n_{\\text{soft}}, n_{\\text{unstable}}]$, with $\\lambda_{\\min}$ in $\\mathrm{N/m}$ as a float.\n\nThe test suite covers:\n- A general stable case with moderate cable tension $T_c=2.0$ and strut compression $N_s=-1.5$ using small axial rigidities $E_c A_c=0.01$, $E_s A_s=0.02$ to emphasize prestress stabilization.\n- A cable-removal case that reduces connectivity and can reveal softening effects.\n- A high-compression case that can lead to negative eigenvalues, indicating instability.\n- A high-tension case that increases geometric stiffness and raises the minimal eigenvalue.\n\nThe final program implements the described assembly, boundary handling, and eigenanalysis, and prints a single line containing the list of results for the four test cases in the format specified.",
