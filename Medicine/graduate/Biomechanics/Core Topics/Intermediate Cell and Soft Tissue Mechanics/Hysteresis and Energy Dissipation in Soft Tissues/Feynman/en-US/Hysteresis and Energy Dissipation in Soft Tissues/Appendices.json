The Maxwell model is a fundamental and standard representation of linear viscoelastic behavior in materials science and biomechanics. The provided constitutive equation correctly describes a Maxwell element. The use of complex modulus to analyze the response to sinusoidal loading is a standard and powerful technique in the field of rheology and viscoelasticity.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a linear ordinary differential equation, a specific form for the input forcing function, and clear definitions for the quantities to be derived. All necessary parameters ($E$, $\\eta$, $\\omega$) are provided symbolically, allowing for the derivation of a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and unambiguous scientific language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and consistent. The information provided is sufficient to perform the required derivation without needing external assumptions.\n- **Realism**: The Maxwell model represents a simplified but physically meaningful approximation of the behavior of certain soft tissues under specific conditions (e.g., small, rapid deformations). It is a standard textbook model used to introduce the concepts of viscoelasticity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a standard exercise in linear viscoelasticity theory. The solution process may now proceed.\n\nThe derivation begins by transforming the time-domain constitutive relation into the frequency domain using a complex exponential representation for the sinusoidal signals. A general sinusoidal strain and stress at angular frequency $\\omega$ can be represented in complex form as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\hat{\\varepsilon}e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\varepsilon}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}$ are the complex amplitudes of strain and stress, respectively. The physical quantities are typically taken as the real or imaginary parts of these complex representations. The complex amplitudes $\\hat{\\varepsilon}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}$ are generally complex numbers, with their arguments representing phase shifts.\n\nThe time derivatives of these signals are:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\hat{\\varepsilon}e^{i\\omega t}) = i\\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon}e^{i\\omega t} = i\\omega \\varepsilon(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t}) = i\\omega \\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t} = i\\omega \\sigma(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these complex forms into the given constitutive relation, $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta} + \\frac{1}{E}\\dot{\\sigma}$, yields:\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon}e^{i\\omega t} = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t}}{\\eta} + \\frac{1}{E}(i\\omega \\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t})\n$$\nThe common factor $e^{i\\omega t}$ can be canceled from every term, leaving a relationship between the complex amplitudes:\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\eta} + \\frac{i\\omega}{E}\\hat{\\sigma}\n$$\nWe can factor out $\\hat{\\sigma}$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} = \\hat{\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\eta} + \\frac{i\\omega}{E} \\right)\n$$\nThe complex modulus $E^{*}(\\omega)$ is defined as the ratio of the complex stress amplitude to the complex strain amplitude, $E^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\hat{\\varepsilon}}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$\nE^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\hat{\\varepsilon}} = \\frac{i\\omega}{\\frac{1}{\\eta} + \\frac{i\\omega}{E}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we find a common denominator for the term in the parentheses:\n$$\nE^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{i\\omega}{\\frac{E + i\\omega\\eta}{E\\eta}}\n$$\nInverting the denominator and multiplying gives the first required expression:\n$$\nE^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{i\\omega E\\eta}{E + i\\omega\\eta}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the complex modulus in terms of $E$, $\\eta$, and $\\omega$.\n\nThe second task is to find the loss modulus, $E''(\\omega)$, which is the imaginary part of $E^{*}(\\omega)$. To do this, we must separate the expression for $E^{*}(\\omega)$ into its real and imaginary parts. This is achieved by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator, which is $(E - i\\omega\\eta)$:\n$$\nE^{*}(\\omega) = \\left( \\frac{i\\omega E\\eta}{E + i\\omega\\eta} \\right) \\left( \\frac{E - i\\omega\\eta}{E - i\\omega\\eta} \\right)\n$$\nThe numerator becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = (i\\omega E\\eta)(E - i\\omega\\eta) = i\\omega E^2\\eta - i^2\\omega^2 E\\eta^2 = i\\omega E^2\\eta - (-1)\\omega^2 E\\eta^2 = \\omega^2 E\\eta^2 + i(\\omega E^2\\eta)\n$$\nThe denominator is the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which results in the sum of the squares of its real and imaginary parts:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = (E + i\\omega\\eta)(E - i\\omega\\eta) = E^2 - (i\\omega\\eta)^2 = E^2 - i^2\\omega^2\\eta^2 = E^2 + \\omega^2\\eta^2\n$$\nCombining the new numerator and denominator gives:\n$$\nE^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega^2 E\\eta^2 + i(\\omega E^2\\eta)}{E^2 + \\omega^2\\eta^2}\n$$\nSeparating this into real and imaginary components, $E^{*}(\\omega) = E'(\\omega) + iE''(\\omega)$:\n$$\nE^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega^2 E\\eta^2}{E^2 + \\omega^2\\eta^2} + i \\left( \\frac{\\omega E^2\\eta}{E^2 + \\omega^2\\eta^2} \\right)\n$$\nThe real part is the storage modulus, $E'(\\omega)$, and the imaginary part is the loss modulus, $E''(\\omega)$. By definition, the loss modulus is:\n$$\nE''(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega E^2\\eta}{E^2 + \\omega^2\\eta^2}\n$$\nThis is the second required expression, given only in terms of $E$, $\\eta$, and $\\omega$.\n\nThe two derived expressions are:\n1. Complex Modulus: $E^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{i\\omega E\\eta}{E + i\\omega\\eta}$\n2. Loss Modulus: $E''(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega E^2\\eta}{E^2 + \\omega^2\\eta^2}$\nThese constitute the complete solution to the problem.",

Strain and Strain Rate Characterization**\n\nThe cycle period is $ T = 1/f $. We define the cycle to start at $ t=0 $.\n\n**Loading Phase ($ 0 \\le t \\le T/2 $):**\nThe strain $ \\epsilon(t) $ increases linearly from $ -\\epsilon_{0} $ to $ +\\epsilon_{0} $. The strain rate, $ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) $, is the constant slope over this interval:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{\\Delta\\epsilon}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{0} - (-\\epsilon_{0})}{T/2 - 0} = \\frac{2\\epsilon_{0}}{T/2} = \\frac{4\\epsilon_{0}}{T} $$\nSince $ T = 1/f $, the strain rate during loading is:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{\\mathrm{L}} = 4f\\epsilon_{0} $$\nThe strain as a function of time during loading is $ \\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon(0) + \\dot{\\epsilon}_{\\mathrm{L}}t = -\\epsilon_{0} + (4f\\epsilon_{0})t $.\n\n**Unloading Phase ($ T/2 \\le t \\le T $):**\nThe strain $ \\epsilon(t) $ decreases linearly from $ +\\epsilon_{0} $ to $ -\\epsilon_{0} $. The strain rate is again the constant slope:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{\\Delta\\epsilon}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{-\\epsilon_{0} - \\epsilon_{0}}{T - T/2} = \\frac{-2\\epsilon_{0}}{T/2} = -\\frac{4\\epsilon_{0}}{T} $$\nThe strain rate during unloading is:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{\\mathrm{U}} = -4f\\epsilon_{0} $$\nThe strain as a function of time during unloading is $ \\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon(T/2) + \\dot{\\epsilon}_{\\mathrm{U}}(t - T/2) = \\epsilon_{0} - (4f\\epsilon_{0})(t - T/2) $.\n\nNote that the magnitude of the strain rate, $ |\\dot{\\epsilon}| $, is constant throughout the cycle and equals $ 4f\\epsilon_{0} $.\n\n**2. Hysteresis Loop Shape ($ \\sigma $ vs. $ \\epsilon $)**\n\nThe constitutive relation is $ \\sigma(t) = E\\,\\epsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) $. We can express stress as a function of strain for the two branches of the cycle.\n\n**Loading Branch ($ \\dot{\\epsilon} = 4f\\epsilon_{0} $):**\nThe stress is given by substituting the constant loading strain rate into the constitutive equation.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\epsilon) = E\\,\\epsilon + \\eta\\,(4f\\epsilon_{0}) = E\\,\\epsilon + 4\\eta f\\epsilon_{0} $$\nThis equation describes the upper branch of the hysteresis loop as $ \\epsilon $ goes from $ -\\epsilon_{0} $ to $ +\\epsilon_{0} $. It is a straight line in the $ \\sigma $-$\\epsilon $ plane with slope $ E $ and a positive $ \\sigma $-intercept of $ 4\\eta f\\epsilon_{0} $.\n\n**Unloading Branch ($ \\dot{\\epsilon} = -4f\\epsilon_{0} $):**\nSimilarly, the stress during unloading is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{U}}(\\epsilon) = E\\,\\epsilon + \\eta\\,(-4f\\epsilon_{0}) = E\\,\\epsilon - 4\\eta f\\epsilon_{0} $$\nThis equation describes the lower branch of the hysteresis loop as $ \\epsilon $ goes from $ +\\epsilon_{0} $ to $ -\\epsilon_{0} $. It is a straight line parallel to the loading branch, also with slope $ E $, but with a negative $ \\sigma $-intercept of $ -4\\eta f\\epsilon_{0} $.\n\nThe combination of these two linear branches forms a parallelogram, which is the shape of the hysteresis loop in the stress-strain plane.\n\n**3. Energy Dissipation Calculation**\n\nThe energy dissipated per unit volume per cycle, $ W_{\\mathrm{d}} $, is the area enclosed by the hysteresis loop, given by the integral $ W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\oint \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon $. A physically insightful method to calculate this is to integrate the power dissipation per unit volume, $ \\sigma(t)\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) $, over one full period $ T $.\n\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\sigma(t)\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nSubstituting the Kelvin–Voigt constitutive relation $ \\sigma(t) = E\\,\\epsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) $:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\left(E\\,\\epsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)\\right)\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\int_{0}^{T} E\\,\\epsilon(t)\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\int_{0}^{T} \\eta\\,(\\dot{\\epsilon}(t))^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\n\nThe first integral represents the work done by the elastic component. Since $ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\mathrm{d}\\epsilon/\\mathrm{d}t $, we can change the variable of integration:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} E\\,\\epsilon(t)\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = E \\int_{\\epsilon(0)}^{\\epsilon(T)} \\epsilon\\,\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon $$\nBecause the cycle is closed, the final strain equals the initial strain, $ \\epsilon(T) = \\epsilon(0) = -\\epsilon_{0} $. Thus, the integral is:\n$$ E \\int_{-\\epsilon_{0}}^{-\\epsilon_{0}} \\epsilon\\,\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon = 0 $$\nThis confirms that the elastic component is conservative and does not dissipate energy over a closed loop.\n\nThe second integral represents the work done by the viscous component, which is purely dissipative.\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\eta\\,(\\dot{\\epsilon}(t))^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nAs determined earlier, the strain rate $ \\dot{\\epsilon}(t) $ is piecewise constant. Specifically, $ (\\dot{\\epsilon}(t))^{2} = (4f\\epsilon_{0})^{2} $ for $ t \\in [0, T/2] $ and $ (\\dot{\\epsilon}(t))^{2} = (-4f\\epsilon_{0})^{2} $ for $ t \\in [T/2, T] $. In both cases, the squared term is constant:\n$$ (\\dot{\\epsilon}(t))^{2} = (4f\\epsilon_{0})^{2} = 16f^{2}\\epsilon_{0}^{2} $$\nfor all $ t \\in [0, T] $ (except at instantaneous reversals, which are points of measure zero and do not affect the integral's value).\n\nThe integral for $ W_{\\mathrm{d}} $ becomes:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\eta \\int_{0}^{T} 16f^{2}\\epsilon_{0}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nSince the integrand is constant, we have:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{d}} = 16\\eta f^{2}\\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\int_{0}^{T} \\mathrm{d}t = 16\\eta f^{2}\\epsilon_{0}^{2} [t]_{0}^{T} = 16\\eta f^{2}\\epsilon_{0}^{2} T $$\nSubstituting $ T = 1/f $:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{d}} = 16\\eta f^{2}\\epsilon_{0}^{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{f}\\right) = 16\\eta f\\epsilon_{0}^{2} $$\n\nThe energy dissipated per cycle per unit volume depends linearly on the viscosity $ \\eta $ and the frequency $ f $, and quadratically on the strain amplitude $ \\epsilon_{0} $. It is independent of the elastic modulus $ E $, as the elastic energy is stored and recovered without loss in a closed cycle.",

Over one cycle, the hysteretic energy dissipation density equals the closed-path integral\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\oint \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}.\n$$\nUnder uniaxial loading, this simplifies to\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\oint \\sigma \\, d\\varepsilon,\n$$\nwhich is the area enclosed by the stress-strain loop in the $\\sigma$–$\\varepsilon$ plane. This definition is path-parametrization invariant: for any smooth parameter $\\lambda$, if the loop is traversed once, the integral $\\oint \\sigma \\, d\\varepsilon$ is independent of the speed along the loop.\n\nFor a time-parameterized cycle with period $T = 1/f$ and angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, a practical FE post-processing routine must evaluate the integral from discrete samples of $\\sigma(t)$ and $\\varepsilon(t)$ over one cycle. To ensure the loop is closed geometrically, it is essential to include both endpoints $t = 0$ and $t = T$, yielding $N+1$ samples and $N$ segments. A robust, frame-indifferent numerical quadrature is the trapezoidal rule applied directly to the parametric curve:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\sigma(t_k) + \\sigma(t_{k+1})}{2} \\left[ \\varepsilon(t_{k+1}) - \\varepsilon(t_k) \\right],\n$$\nwith $t_k = k \\Delta t$, $\\Delta t = T/N$, and $k=0,1,\\dots,N$, so that $t_0 = 0$ and $t_N = T$. This is a discrete line integral along the loop that approximates $\\oint \\sigma \\, d\\varepsilon$ without requiring explicit differentiation of $\\varepsilon(t)$ or time-domain multiplication.\n\nTo generate scientifically realistic synthetic FE outputs for a heterogeneous tissue, we employ a Kelvin-Voigt-type viscoelastic stress response at the element level:\n$$\n\\sigma_i(t) = E_i \\, \\varepsilon(t) + \\eta_i \\, \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t),\n$$\nwith element-specific parameters $(E_i, \\eta_i)$ to model heterogeneity. The strain excitation is prescribed as a sinusoid\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\sin(\\omega t),\n$$\nwith analytic time derivative\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\omega \\varepsilon_0 \\cos(\\omega t),\n$$\nensuring noise-free data appropriate for benchmarking the post-processing routine. Using these definitions and the trapezoidal rule on the parametric curve $(\\varepsilon(t), \\sigma_i(t))$, we compute the element-wise $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ for each test case.\n\nPrinciple-based derivation of expected qualitative behavior:\n- For purely elastic elements with $\\eta_i = 0$, we have $\\sigma_i(t) = E_i \\varepsilon(t)$. The integral over one cycle of a conservative elastic response yields\n$$\n\\oint \\sigma_i \\, d\\varepsilon = \\oint E_i \\varepsilon \\, d\\varepsilon = E_i \\oint d\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon^2 \\right) = 0,\n$$\nsince the loop returns to the initial state. Therefore, $W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 0$ (up to numerical quadrature error).\n- For viscoelastic elements with $\\eta_i > 0$, hysteresis arises from the phase-lag between stress and strain due to the viscous term. From first principles, the dissipation per cycle can be expressed by time-parametrization as\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\oint \\sigma_i \\, d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^T \\sigma_i(t) \\, \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) \\, dt = \\int_0^T \\left[ E_i \\varepsilon(t) + \\eta_i \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) \\right] \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) \\, dt.\n$$\nThe elastic term integrates to zero over one cycle because $\\int_0^T \\varepsilon(t) \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) dt = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\varepsilon(T)^2 - \\varepsilon(0)^2 \\right] = 0$. The viscous contribution yields\n$$\n\\int_0^T \\eta_i \\left[ \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) \\right]^2 dt = \\eta_i \\omega^2 \\varepsilon_0^2 \\int_0^T \\cos^2(\\omega t) \\, dt = \\eta_i \\omega^2 \\varepsilon_0^2 \\frac{T}{2} = \\pi \\eta_i \\omega \\varepsilon_0^2,\n$$\ndemonstrating that $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ scales with $\\eta_i$, $\\omega$, and $\\varepsilon_0^2$. This analytic relation corroborates the correctness of the trapezoidal numerical integral on $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma)$ in the code, while the implementation uses the general integral definition rather than a shortcut formula.\n\nNumerical algorithm details implemented in code:\n- For each test case, construct $t_k = k \\Delta t$, $k = 0,\\dots,N$, with $\\Delta t = T/N$ and $T = 1/f$.\n- Compute $\\varepsilon_k = \\varepsilon_0 \\sin(\\omega t_k)$ and $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_k = \\omega \\varepsilon_0 \\cos(\\omega t_k)$ for all $k$.\n- For each element $i$, compute $\\sigma_{i,k} = E_i \\varepsilon_k + \\eta_i \\dot{\\varepsilon}_k$.\n- Evaluate the trapezoidal line integral in strain space:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d},i} \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\sigma_{i,k} + \\sigma_{i,k+1}}{2} \\left( \\varepsilon_{k+1} - \\varepsilon_k \\right).\n$$\n- Round each $W_{\\mathrm{d},i}$ to $6$ decimal places and report in Pascals (Pa).\n\nTest suite coverage:\n- Test Case $1$ validates that purely elastic elements produce $W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 0$ across heterogeneous stiffness.\n- Test Case $2$ validates that viscoelastic elements produce positive $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ in proportion to $\\eta_i$, with high-resolution sampling ($N = 4000$) ensuring convergence of the numerical integral.\n- Test Case $3$ stresses the numerical routine under coarse sampling ($N = 16$) and higher frequency ($f = 5.0$), ensuring robustness and producing approximate but still physically consistent $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\n\nThe final program prints a single line with the nested list of $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ values for the three test cases, rounded to $6$ decimal places, in Pascals (Pa), as required.",
