Since $232 \\ll 2300$ (the typical critical value for pipe flow), the laminar flow assumption is fully consistent with the given parameters.\n5.  **Plausibility**: The numerical values are physically realistic, corresponding to, for example, blood flow in a small artery.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all provided data are consistent and complete. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the conservation of linear momentum for an incompressible Newtonian fluid, expressed by the Navier-Stokes equations. In cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$, the axial ($z$-) momentum equation is:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial t} + v_r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} + \\frac{v_\\theta}{r} \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta} + v_z \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right] + \\rho g_z\n$$\nWe apply the given assumptions to simplify this equation:\n1.  **Steady flow**: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **Axisymmetry**: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, which also implies the tangential velocity $v_\\theta = 0$.\n3.  **No flow in the radial direction**: For a straight pipe of constant radius, $v_r = 0$.\n4.  **Fully developed flow**: The velocity profile is constant along the axial direction, so $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$. This also satisfies the continuity equation for incompressible flow, $\\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r v_r)}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial v_\\theta}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$, which simplifies to $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$.\nWe also neglect gravitational effects, setting $g_z=0$, or assume a horizontal tube.\n\nApplying these simplifications, all terms on the left-hand side (the convective acceleration terms) and several terms on the right-hand side become zero. The axial momentum equation reduces to:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} \\right)\n$$\nSince $v_z$ is a function of $r$ only, $v_z = v_z(r)$, the partial derivatives with respect to $r$ can be written as ordinary derivatives. For fully developed flow, the pressure gradient $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}$ cannot be a function of $r$, and since the flow is steady, it cannot be a function of $t$. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}$ can only be a function of $z$ or a constant. However, the right-hand side of the equation is a function of $r$ only. For the equality to hold for all $r$ and $z$, both sides must be equal to the same constant. Let's write $\\frac{dp}{dz} = \\text{constant}$.\nRearranging the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dv_z}{dr} \\right)\n$$\nWe integrate this equation with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\int r \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} dr = \\int \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dv_z}{dr} \\right) dr\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} = r \\frac{dv_z}{dr} + C_1\n$$\nDue to axisymmetry, the velocity profile must be smooth at the centerline ($r=0$), which requires the velocity gradient to be zero: $\\left. \\frac{dv_z}{dr} \\right|_{r=0} = 0$. For the term $\\frac{C_1}{r}$ (which would arise from isolating $\\frac{dv_z}{dr}$) to be finite at $r=0$, the integration constant $C_1$ must be zero.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dv_z}{dr} = \\frac{r}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz}\n$$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $r$:\n$$\nv_z(r) = \\int \\frac{r}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} dr = \\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} + C_2\n$$\nWe find the second integration constant, $C_2$, by applying the no-slip boundary condition at the tube wall: $v_z(R) = 0$.\n$$\n0 = \\frac{R^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{R^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$\nv_z(r) = \\frac{1}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} (r^2 - R^2)\n$$\nSince flow is in the positive $z$-direction ($v_z > 0$) and $r^2 - R^2 \\le 0$, the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dz}$ must be negative.\n\nNext, we calculate the volumetric flow rate $Q$ by integrating the velocity profile over the tube's cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$\nQ = \\int_A v_z(r) dA = \\int_0^R v_z(r) (2\\pi r) dr\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\int_0^R \\frac{1}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} (r^2 - R^2) (2\\pi r) dr = \\frac{2\\pi}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} \\int_0^R (r^3 - R^2 r) dr\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} - \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} \\right]_0^R = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} - \\frac{R^4}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} \\left( -\\frac{R^4}{4} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ = -\\frac{\\pi R^4}{8\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz}\n$$\nThis is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The constant pressure gradient can be expressed in terms of the pressure drop $\\Delta p = p_{inlet} - p_{outlet}$ over the tube length $L$ as $\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$. Substituting this into the equation for $Q$:\n$$\nQ = -\\frac{\\pi R^4}{8\\mu} \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi R^4}{8\\mu L} \\Delta p\n$$\nRearranging to show the linear relationship between $\\Delta p$ and $Q$:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\left( \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi R^4} \\right) Q\n$$\nThis is of the form $\\Delta p = R_h Q$, where the hydraulic resistance $R_h$ is given by:\n$$\nR_h = \\frac{8\\mu L}{\\pi R^4}\n$$\nThis expression for $R_h$ depends only on the fluid viscosity $\\mu$ and the tube geometry ($L$ and $R$), as required.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for the pressure drop $\\Delta p$ using the provided parameters:\n$\\mu = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n$L = 0.30\\ \\text{m}$\n$R = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$\n$Q = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}^{3}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nUsing the derived formula $\\Delta p = \\frac{8\\mu L Q}{\\pi R^4}$:\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{8 (3.5 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.30) (3.0 \\times 10^{-6})}{\\pi (2.5 \\times 10^{-3})^4}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{2.52 \\times 10^{-8}}{\\pi (3.90625 \\times 10^{-11})} \\ \\text{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{2.52 \\times 10^{-8}}{1.2271846... \\times 10^{-10}} \\ \\text{Pa} \\approx 205.349\\ \\text{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilopascals (kPa).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the fractional error between an estimated Newtonian viscosity and the apparent viscosity at the wall for a power-law fluid in a pipe flow experiment. The derivation must originate from the fundamental momentum balance and the given constitutive equation.\n\nThe starting point is the differential momentum balance for a steady, fully developed, incompressible, and axisymmetric flow in a cylindrical coordinate system ($r, \\theta, z$).

The magnitude of the shear stress is $\\tau(r) = \\frac{\\Delta p}{2L} r$.\nThe wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is the shear stress at the tube wall, $r=R$:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\frac{\\Delta p R}{2L} $$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nThe fluid is described by the power-law constitutive relation $\\tau_{rz} = K \\, |\\dot{\\gamma}|^{n-1} \\dot{\\gamma}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the volumetric flow rate $Q$ for a steady, incompressible, laminar flow in a compliant circular tube. The problem is a boundary value problem for the axial pressure $p(x)$, which is modeled using a shooting method. The solution involves coupling a numerical ODE integrator with a root-finding algorithm.\n\nThe governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the pressure $p(x)$ along the tube axis $x \\in [0,L]$ is derived from the Hagen-Poiseuille law, applied locally to a tube segment of radius $R(p)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{8\\,\\mu\\,Q}{\\pi\\,R(p)^4}\n$$\nHere, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $Q$ is the constant volumetric flow rate. The tube radius $R$ is not constant but depends on the local pressure $p$ through a given linear compliance law:\n$$\nR(p) = R_0 \\left[1 + c\\,\\left(p - p_0\\right)\\right]\n$$\nwhere $R_0$ is the reference radius at pressure $p_0$, and $c$ is the compliance coefficient. The problem is subject to the boundary conditions $p(0) = p_{\\text{in}}$ and $p(L) = p_{\\text{out}}$.\n\nThe core of the problem is that the flow rate $Q$ is unknown. We must find the value of $Q$ that ensures the solution to the ODE with the initial condition $p(0) = p_{\\text{in}}$ also satisfies the terminal condition $p(L) = p_{\\text{out}}$. This structure lends itself to a shooting method.\n\nWe define a mismatch function, $F(Q)$, which represents the difference between the computed outlet pressure for a given $Q$ and the desired outlet pressure $p_{\\text{out}}$:\n$$\nF(Q) = p(L;Q) - p_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nwhere $p(L;Q)$ is the pressure at $x=L$ obtained by solving the ODE as an initial value problem (IVP) starting from $p(0) = p_{\\text{in}}$ with a trial value of $Q$. The problem is thus transformed into finding the root of the scalar equation $F(Q)=0$.\n\nTo compute $p(L;Q)$, we numerically integrate the ODE from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The problem specifies the use of the fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta (RK4) method with a uniform grid of $N$ steps. The step size is $h = L/N$. For each step from $x_i$ to $x_{i+1} = x_i + h$, the pressure $p_{i+1}$ is updated from $p_i$ as follows:\n$$\np_{i+1} = p_i + \\frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)\n$$\nwhere the stages $k_j$ are given by:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(p, Q) &= -\\frac{8\\,\\mu\\,Q}{\\pi\\,R(p)^4} \\\\\nk_1 &= f(p_i, Q) \\\\\nk_2 &= f(p_i + \\frac{h}{2}k_1, Q) \\\\\nk_3 &= f(p_i + \\frac{h}{2}k_2, Q) \\\\\nk_4 &= f(p_i + hk_3, Q)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nStarting with $p_0=p_{\\text{in}}$, we perform $N$ such steps to find $p_N \\approx p(L;Q)$.\n\nTo find the root of $F(Q)=0$, we employ the bisection method, a robust bracketing-based root-finder. This method is suitable because $F(Q)$ is a monotonic function of $Q$. Since $p_{\\text{in}} > p_{\\text{out}}$ in all test cases, we expect $Q > 0$. An increase in $Q$ leads to a larger pressure drop, thus decreasing the value of $p(L;Q)$. Therefore, $F(Q)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $Q$. This guarantees a unique root and the success of the bisection method, provided a valid initial bracket $[Q_a, Q_b]$ is found such that $F(Q_a) > 0$ and $F(Q_b) < 0$.\n\nA suitable bracketing interval can be established as follows:\n1.  Lower bound: $Q_a = 0$. In this case, $dp/dx = 0$, so $p(L;0) = p_{\\text{in}}$. The mismatch function is $F(0) = p_{\\text{in}} - p_{\\text{out}}$, which is positive for all given test cases.\n2.  Upper bound: $Q_b$ must be chosen large enough to ensure $p(L;Q_b) < p_{\\text{out}}$, making $F(Q_b)$ negative. A safe way to find such a $Q_b$ is to calculate the flow rate for an equivalent rigid tube, $Q_{\\text{rigid}} = \\frac{\\pi R_0^4 (p_{\\text{in}}-p_{\\text{out}})}{8\\mu L}$, and choose $Q_b$ as a multiple of this estimate (e.g., $10 \\times Q_{\\text{rigid}}$). This is generally sufficient to cause a large enough pressure drop.\n\nThe bisection algorithm proceeds by repeatedly bisecting the interval $[Q_a, Q_b]$ and selecting the subinterval in which the root must lie. At each iteration, we compute the midpoint $Q_{\\text{mid}} = (Q_a + Q_b)/2$ and evaluate $F(Q_{\\text{mid}})$. The bracket is updated based on the sign of $F(Q_{\\text{mid}})$. The process terminates when the convergence criterion is met, which the problem defines as an absolute tolerance on the pressure mismatch:\n$$\n|F(Q_{\\text{mid}})| = |p(L;Q_{\\text{mid}}) - p_{\\text{out}}| < \\varepsilon_p\n$$\nwith $\\varepsilon_p = 10^{-3}$ Pa.\n\nThe implementation combines these components. A main function iterates through the provided test cases. For each case, it calls a function that implements the bisection method. This function, in turn, calls the RK4 integration routine at each iteration to evaluate the mismatch function $F(Q)$. The final computed $Q$ for each case is then formatted and printed as required.",
