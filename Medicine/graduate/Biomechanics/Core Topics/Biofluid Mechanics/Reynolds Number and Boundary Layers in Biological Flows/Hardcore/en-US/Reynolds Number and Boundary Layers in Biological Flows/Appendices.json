Over a short axial extent downstream of the snout, the surface can be modeled locally as a smooth, flat plate aligned with a uniform external flow.

Let the external speed be $U$, the kinematic viscosity be $\\nu$, and the downstream distance from the leading edge along the skin be $x$.

Your final answer must be a single number.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics, specifically boundary layer theory. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($\\nu=1.1\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$, $U=0.60\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $x=0.080\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $C_{99}=4.91$) and a clear objective. The parameters are physically realistic, and the language is precise and objective. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nWe proceed with the solution. The problem asks for two main parts: first, to justify the functional form of the boundary layer thickness $\\delta(x)$, and second, to calculate its numerical value at a specific location.\n\nPart 1: Functional Dependence of $\\delta(x)$\n\nThe flow is described as steady, two-dimensional, incompressible, and laminar over a flat plate with a uniform external flow velocity $U$. The governing equations for this scenario (the Blasius problem) are the boundary layer equations, derived from the Navier-Stokes equations under the assumption of a high Reynolds number and a thin viscous layer near the surface. For a zero-pressure-gradient flow, these are:\n\nContinuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\nStreamwise ($x$) momentum equation:\n$$ u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} $$\n\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the streamwise ($x$) and wall-normal ($y$) directions, respectively, and $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. The boundary conditions are no-slip at the wall ($y=0$) and matching to the freestream flow far from the wall:\n$$ u(x, 0) = 0, \\quad v(x, 0) = 0 $$\n$$ u(x, y \\to \\infty) = U $$\n\nThe boundary layer thickness, $\\delta$, is expected to be a function of the variables that define the problem: the downstream distance $x$, the freestream velocity $U$, and the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$. Thus, we can write $\\delta = f(x, U, \\nu)$.\n\nWe use dimensional analysis to determine the form of this function. The dimensions of the relevant quantities are:\n- Boundary layer thickness: $[\\delta] = L$\n- Downstream distance: $[x] = L$\n- Freestream velocity: $[U] = L T^{-1}$\n- Kinematic viscosity: $[\\nu] = L^2 T^{-1}$\n\nWe propose a power-law relationship:\n$$ \\delta \\propto x^a U^b \\nu^c $$\nExpressing this in terms of fundamental dimensions (Length $L$, Time $T$):\n$$ L^1 T^0 = (L)^a (L T^{-1})^b (L^2 T^{-1})^c = L^{a+b+2c} T^{-b-c} $$\nEquating the exponents for each dimension gives a system of two linear equations for the three unknowns $a$, $b$, and $c$:\n1. For $T$: $-b-c = 0 \\implies c = -b$\n2. For $L$: $a+b+2c = 1$\n\nSubstituting $c = -b$ into the second equation:\n$$ a + b + 2(-b) = 1 \\implies a - b = 1 \\implies b = a - 1 $$\nThen $c = -b = -(a-1) = 1-a$.\n\nAt this point, we have expressed $b$ and $c$ in terms of $a$. The relationship is:\n$$ \\delta \\propto x^a U^{a-1} \\nu^{1-a} = \\nu U^{-1} \\left( \\frac{Ux}{\\nu} \\right)^a $$\nDimensional analysis alone cannot uniquely determine the exponent $a$. However, the boundary layer equations for a flat plate admit a similarity solution. This implies that the dimensionless velocity profile $u/U$ is a function of a single dimensionless similarity variable $\\eta$, which collapses the profiles from all $x$ locations onto a single curve. The similarity variable is defined by scaling the wall-normal coordinate $y$ by the characteristic thickness of the boundary layer, which is $\\delta(x)$.\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{y}{\\delta(x)} $$\nFor the partial differential equations to be transformed into a single ordinary differential equation in $\\eta$, a specific scaling must be chosen. The correct scaling, as found by Blasius, gives a boundary layer thickness that grows with the square root of the downstream distance. This corresponds to setting the exponent $a = 1/2$.\nWith $a=1/2$, we find $b=a-1 = -1/2$ and $c=1-a = 1/2$.\n\nThe functional dependence is therefore:\n$$ \\delta(x) \\propto x^{1/2} U^{-1/2} \\nu^{1/2} $$\nThis can be written in a canonical form:\n$$ \\delta(x) \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U}} $$\nThis demonstrates that the boundary layer thickness is proportional to the square root of distance $x$ and viscosity $\\nu$, and inversely proportional to the square root of the freestream speed $U$.\nWe can express this relationship with a proportionality constant, which depends on the specific definition of $\\delta$. For the definition $u(x, \\delta) = 0.99\\,U$, the constant is given as $C_{99}$.\n$$ \\delta(x) = C_{99} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu x}{U}} $$\nThis justifies the required functional dependence based on dimensional analysis and similarity considerations. An alternative way to express this is using the local Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}_x = \\frac{Ux}{\\nu}$:\n$$ \\delta(x) = C_{99} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Re}_x}} $$\n\nPart 2: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Kinematic viscosity of seawater: $\\nu = 1.1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s}$\n- Swimming speed: $U = 0.60 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Downstream distance: $x = 0.080 \\, \\mathrm{m}$\n- Similarity constant for $99\\%$ thickness: $C_{99} = 4.91$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived formula for $\\delta(x)$:\n$$ \\delta(x) = 4.91 \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s}) (0.080 \\, \\mathrm{m})}{0.60 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}}} $$\nFirst, we evaluate the term under the square root:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu x}{U} = \\frac{(1.1 \\times 10^{-6}) (0.080)}{0.60} \\, \\mathrm{m^2} = \\frac{0.088 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.60} \\, \\mathrm{m^2} \\approx 1.4666... \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{m^2} $$\nNow, we compute $\\delta(x)$:\n$$ \\delta(x) = 4.91 \\sqrt{1.4666... \\times 10^{-7}} \\, \\mathrm{m} \\approx 4.91 \\times (3.829708... \\times 10^{-4}) \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\delta(x) \\approx 1.880386... \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$). We convert the result from meters to millimeters by multiplying by $1000$:\n$$ \\delta(x) \\approx (1.880386... \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 1000 \\, \\mathrm{mm} = 1.880386... \\, \\mathrm{mm} $$\nFinally, we round the result to three significant figures:\n$$ \\delta(x) \\approx 1.88 \\, \\mathrm{mm} $$\nAs a check, the local Reynolds number is $\\mathrm{Re}_x = \\frac{Ux}{\\nu} = \\frac{(0.60)(0.080)}{1.1 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 4.36 \\times 10^4$. This value is well below the typical critical Reynolds number for transition to turbulence on a flat plate (around $5 \\times 10^5$), which validates the initial assumption of a laminar boundary layer.",

            "solution": "The problem is first validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in biomechanical fluid mechanics that can be solved from first principles.\n\nWe begin with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for momentum in a Cartesian coordinate system $(x,y)$. For a steady, two-dimensional flow, the $x$-momentum equation is:\n$$ \\rho \\left( u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right) = - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively, and $p$ is the pressure.\n\nThe problem states we can use the lubrication approximation. This implies several simplifications:\n1.  Negligible inertia: The Reynolds number is small, so the convective acceleration terms on the left-hand side are negligible compared to the viscous and pressure terms. The left side of the equation becomes $0$.\n2.  Small aspect ratio: The film thickness $h$ is much smaller than the characteristic length in the flow direction. This means that velocity gradients in the transverse direction ($y$) are much larger than in the axial direction ($x$), i.e., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\gg \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. Consequently, the term $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$ can be neglected compared to $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$.\n3.  The pressure $p$ is a function of $x$ only, so $p=p(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\frac{dp}{dx}$.\n4.  The axial velocity $u$ is a function of $y$ only, so $u=u(y)$.\n\nApplying these simplifications to the $x$-momentum equation yields the following ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$ 0 = - \\frac{dp}{dx} + \\mu \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} $$\nRearranging gives the governing equation for the velocity profile:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nSince $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is a uniform (constant) pressure gradient, we can integrate this equation twice with respect to $y$ to find the velocity profile $u(y)$.\nIntegrating once gives the shear rate:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y + C_1 $$\nIntegrating a second time gives the velocity:\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined by the boundary conditions.\nThe first boundary condition is the no-slip condition at the wall, $y=0$:\n$$ u(0) = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (0)^2 + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0 $$\nThe second boundary condition is the shear-free condition at the free interface, $y=h$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=h} = 0 \\implies \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} h + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{h}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the expression for $u(y)$, we obtain the axial velocity profile:\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 - \\frac{h}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - 2hy) $$\nFor flow in the positive $x$-direction, the pressure must decrease, so $\\frac{dp}{dx}  0$, which correctly yields a positive velocity $u(y)$ for $y \\in (0, h)$.\n\nNext, we derive the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. The shear stress is given by $\\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}$. The wall shear stress is evaluated at $y=0$:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\tau_{yx}|_{y=0} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=0} $$\nUsing our expression for $\\frac{du}{dy}$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y - \\frac{h}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nEvaluating at $y=0$:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (0) - \\frac{h}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\right) = -h \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nNow, we must eliminate the pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$. To do this, we first calculate the cross-section-averaged axial velocity, $U$:\n$$ U = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_0^h u(y) dy = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_0^h \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - 2hy) dy $$\n$$ U = \\frac{1}{2\\mu h} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} - hy^2 \\right]_0^h = \\frac{1}{2\\mu h} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{3} - h^3 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu h} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{2h^3}{3} \\right) $$\n$$ U = -\\frac{h^2}{3\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nWe can rearrange this expression to solve for the pressure gradient:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{3\\mu U}{h^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the wall shear stress $\\tau_w$:\n$$ \\tau_w = -h \\left( -\\frac{3\\mu U}{h^2} \\right) = \\frac{3\\mu U}{h} $$\nThe final step is to express $\\tau_w$ in terms of the Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Re}_h = \\frac{\\rho U h}{\\mu}$.
