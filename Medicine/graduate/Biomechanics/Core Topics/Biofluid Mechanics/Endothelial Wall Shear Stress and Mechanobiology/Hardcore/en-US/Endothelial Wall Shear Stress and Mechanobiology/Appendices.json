            "problem": "A straight, rigid arterial segment of circular cross-section with upstream radius $R$ carries a steady, incompressible, laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ and volumetric flow rate $Q$. Over a short axial extent of length $L_{s}$, there is an eccentric atherosclerotic stenosis that is modeled, for hydraulic purposes, as a locally axisymmetric cylindrical constriction of effective radius $R_{s} = 0.5\\,R$ and constant cross-section through $L_{s}$. Assume no slip at the wall and that the flow far upstream and within any sufficiently long, uniform-radius segment is fully developed and axisymmetric.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics, mathematically well-posed, and objective in its formulation. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model of flow through an arterial stenosis, which is a common and instructive problem in biomechanics. The assumptions, such as fully developed flow within the stenotic segment, are explicitly stated as part of the model to be analyzed, not as flaws in the problem's structure.\n\nWe begin by deriving an expression for the fully developed wall shear stress (WSS) in a uniform tube of radius $a$. The starting point is the conservation of momentum for a steady, incompressible, fully developed, axisymmetric flow of a Newtonian fluid in a circular tube. For flow in the axial direction $x$ within a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, x)$, the axial momentum equation simplifies significantly. For fully developed flow, the axial velocity $v_{x}$ is a function of only the radial coordinate $r$, i.e., $v_{x}(r)$, and the radial and azimuthal velocities are zero. The pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is constant. The simplified momentum balance is:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dx} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\tau_{rx} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\tau_{rx}$ is the shear stress. For a Newtonian fluid, the constitutive relation for shear stress is $\\tau_{rx} = \\mu \\frac{dv_x}{dr}$. Substituting this into the momentum equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dx} = \\frac{\\mu}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dv_x}{dr} \\right) $$\nWe can rearrange and integrate this equation with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\int r \\frac{dp}{dx} dr = \\int \\mu d \\left( r \\frac{dv_x}{dr} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{r^2}{2} \\frac{dp}{dx} = \\mu r \\frac{dv_x}{dr} + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. At the centerline of the tube, $r=0$, the velocity gradient must be zero due to axisymmetry, i.e., $\\left.\\frac{dv_x}{dr}\\right|_{r=0} = 0$. Applying this condition, we find that $C_1 = 0$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{r}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} = \\frac{dv_x}{dr} $$\nIntegrating again with respect to $r$ to find the velocity profile $v_x(r)$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{r}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} dr = \\int dv_x $$\n$$ v_x(r) = \\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} + C_2 $$\nThe second constant of integration, $C_2$, is found by applying the no-slip boundary condition at the wall, $v_x(a) = 0$.\n$$ 0 = \\frac{a^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = - \\frac{a^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back gives the parabolic velocity profile, known as Poiseuille flow:\n$$ v_x(r) = \\frac{1}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (r^2 - a^2) = -\\frac{1}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (a^2 - r^2) $$\nThe problem requires the WSS in terms of the volumetric flow rate $Q$. We relate $Q$ to the pressure gradient by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area:\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{a} v_x(r) \\, 2\\pi r \\, dr = \\int_{0}^{a} \\left( -\\frac{1}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (a^2 - r^2) \\right) 2\\pi r \\, dr $$\n$$ Q = -\\frac{2\\pi}{4\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\int_{0}^{a} (a^2 r - r^3) dr = -\\frac{\\pi}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{a^2 r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{a} $$\n$$ Q = -\\frac{\\pi}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( \\frac{a^4}{2} - \\frac{a^4}{4} \\right) = -\\frac{\\pi a^4}{8\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nThis is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. We can now express the pressure gradient in terms of $Q$:\n$$ -\\frac{dp}{dx} = \\frac{8\\mu Q}{\\pi a^4} $$\nThe wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is defined as the magnitude of the shear stress at the wall ($r=a$). From our earlier expression for the velocity gradient:\n$$ \\frac{dv_x}{dr} = \\frac{r}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nAt the wall, $r=a$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{dv_x}{dr} \\right|_{r=a} = \\frac{a}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nThe shear stress exerted by the fluid on the wall is $\\tau_w = \\mu \\left| \\frac{dv_x}{dr} \\right|_{r=a}$.\n$$ \\tau_w = \\mu \\left| \\frac{a}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\right| = \\frac{a}{2} \\left| \\frac{dp}{dx} \\right| = \\frac{a}{2} \\left( -\\frac{dp}{dx} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for the pressure gradient in terms of $Q$:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\frac{a}{2} \\left( \\frac{8\\mu Q}{\\pi a^4} \\right) = \\frac{4\\mu Q}{\\pi a^3} $$\nThis is the desired expression for the fully developed WSS in a uniform tube of radius $a$.\n\nNext, we compute the WSS amplification factor, $\\mathcal{A} \\equiv \\frac{\\tau_{w,\\text{stenosis}}}{\\tau_{w,\\text{upstream}}}$.\nFor the upstream segment, the radius is $a=R$. The WSS is:\n$$ \\tau_{w,\\text{upstream}} = \\frac{4\\mu Q}{\\pi R^3} $$\nFor the stenosed segment, the radius is $a=R_s$. The volumetric flow rate $Q$ is conserved due to the incompressibility of the fluid. The WSS, assuming fully developed flow within this segment, is:\n$$ \\tau_{w,\\text{stenosis}} = \\frac{4\\mu Q}{\\pi R_s^3} $$\nThe amplification factor is the ratio of these two expressions:\n$$ \\mathcal{A} = \\frac{\\frac{4\\mu Q}{\\pi R_s^3}}{\\frac{4\\mu Q}{\\pi R^3}} = \\frac{R^3}{R_s^3} = \\left(\\frac{R}{R_s}\\right)^3 $$\nFinally, we evaluate $\\mathcal{A}$ for the given condition $R_s = 0.5\\,R$:\n$$ \\mathcal{A} = \\left(\\frac{R}{0.5\\,R}\\right)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{0.5}\\right)^3 = 2^3 = 8 $$\nThe local WSS amplification factor is $8$.\n\nAs requested, we briefly discuss two modeling assumptions that are likely to fail and their mechanobiological significance.\n1.  **Fully Developed Flow Assumption:** The model assumes that the flow is fully developed (i.e., has a parabolic velocity profile) both upstream and within the short stenotic segment. In reality, the abrupt change in geometry at the entrance and exit of the stenosis creates complex flow patterns. The flow requires a certain \"entrance length\" to become fully developed. For a short stenosis, the flow within it will be developing, not fully developed. More critically, downstream of the stenosis, there will be a region of flow separation, recirculation (eddies), and reattachment.\n    *   **Mechanobiological Relevance:** These regions of disturbed flow are characterized by low and oscillating WSS. Endothelial cells, which line the arterial wall, are highly sensitive to hemodynamic forces. While the high, steady laminar shear in the stenosis throat (as calculated) is generally atheroprotective, the low and oscillatory shear stress in the post-stenotic region is highly pro-atherogenic. It promotes endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and cell proliferation, which can lead to the further progression of atherosclerotic plaque. The simplified model completely misses this critical pathogenic environment downstream of the constriction.\n\n2.  **Steady Flow Assumption:** The model assumes a steady volumetric flow rate, $Q$. Arterial blood flow is pulsatile, driven by the cardiac cycle. The flow rate and pressure gradient vary significantly over time.\n    *   **Mechanobiological Relevance:** Endothelial cells respond not only to the magnitude of WSS but also to its temporal characteristics. Pulsatile flow creates time-varying shear stress. The mean shear, pulsatility, and directionality of the shear vector are all important mechanobiological signals. Regions with low mean shear and high oscillatory shear (where flow reverses during the cardiac cycle), measured by the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), are particularly prone to atherosclerosis. A steady flow model cannot capture these dynamic effects, which are fundamental to understanding the initiation and progression of vascular disease.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of blood viscosity data using a power-law fluid model to estimate model parameters and evaluate the accuracy of a simplified Newtonian approximation for wall shear stress (WSS). The solution proceeds by first establishing the theoretical framework for parameter estimation via linear regression, followed by the calculation of relevant physical quantities and the error metric.\n\nThe apparent viscosity $\\mu$ of blood is modeled as a function of the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$ by the power-law constitutive relation, a standard model for generalized Newtonian fluids:\n$$\n\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) = K\\,\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\,n-1}\n$$\nHere, $K$ is the consistency index and $n$ is the dimensionless power-law (or shear-thinning) exponent. For a Newtonian fluid, $n=1$ and $\\mu=K$. For a shear-thinning fluid like blood, $n<1$. For a shear-thickening fluid, $n>1$.\n\nTo determine the parameters $n$ and $K$ from the provided experimental data pairs of $(\\dot{\\gamma}_i, \\mu_i)$, we linearize the power-law model by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(\\mu) = \\ln(K\\,\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\,n-1}) = \\ln(K) + \\ln(\\dot{\\gamma}^{\\,n-1}) = \\ln(K) + (n-1)\\ln(\\dot{\\gamma})\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = b + s x$, where the transformed variables are $y = \\ln(\\mu)$ and $x = \\ln(\\dot{\\gamma})$. The intercept of the line is $b = \\ln(K)$ and the slope is $s = n-1$.\n\nWe apply the method of ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression to the set of transformed data points $(\\ln(\\dot{\\gamma}_i), \\ln(\\mu_i))$ for each experimental case. OLS finds the slope $s$ and intercept $b$ that best fit the data by minimizing the sum of the squared vertical distances between the data points and the fitted line. The standard formulas for $s$ and $b$ for a dataset of size $N$ are:\n$$\ns = \\frac{N \\sum(x_iy_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{N \\sum(x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = \\bar{y} - s\\bar{x}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are the mean values of $x_i$ and $y_i$ respectively. Once $s$ and $b$ are determined from the regression, the power-law parameters are recovered as:\n$$\nn = s + 1\n$$\n$$\nK = e^b\n$$\nWith the parameters $n$ and $K$ estimated, we can calculate the wall shear stress (WSS), denoted $\\tau_{\\mathrm{PL}}$, at a specified wall shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_w$. The WSS is given by the product of the apparent viscosity at the wall and the wall shear rate:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{PL}} = \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}_w)\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_w = (K\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_w^{\\,n-1})\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_w = K\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_w^n\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the WSS under a simplifying Newtonian fluid assumption, denoted $\\tau_N$. The problem specifies that the constant Newtonian viscosity, $\\mu_N$, is to be taken as the arithmetic mean of the measured apparent viscosities in each dataset:\n$$\n\\mu_N = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mu_i\n$$\nThe corresponding Newtonian WSS is then:\n$$\n\\tau_N = \\mu_N\\,\\dot{\\gamma}_w\n$$\nFinally, to quantify the error introduced by this Newtonian approximation, we compute the relative error $\\varepsilon$ with respect to the more accurate power-law model's prediction:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\tau_N - \\tau_{\\mathrm{PL}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{PL}}}\n$$\nThis entire procedure is implemented for each of the four provided test cases, using the specified wall shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_w = 500\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The implementation uses numerical libraries to perform the logarithmic transformation, linear regression, and subsequent calculations. For each case, a list of the five computed values $[n, K, \\tau_{\\mathrm{PL}}, \\tau_N, \\varepsilon]$ is generated, with each value rounded to six decimal places as required.",
