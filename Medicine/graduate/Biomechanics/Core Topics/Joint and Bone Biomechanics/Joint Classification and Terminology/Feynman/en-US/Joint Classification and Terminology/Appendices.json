            "problem": "Consider an open serial-chain kinematic model of a human limb comprising three ideal anatomical joints in series: a proximal spherical joint connecting the trunk to the humerus, a revolute joint connecting the humerus to the forearm, and a revolute joint connecting the forearm to the hand. The spherical joint is modeled as allowing three independent rotations about anatomical axes (flexion–extension, abduction–adduction, and internal–external rotation), each revolute joint allows a single independent rotation about its anatomical axis (elbow flexion–extension and forearm pronation–supination, respectively). The trunk is fixed in space, scapulothoracic motion is excluded, and there are no soft-tissue couplings or articular constraints that reduce independence of the stated joint motions. All joint axes are non-parallel and non-collinear in a way that preserves independence of their generalized coordinates.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition that the mobility $M$ of an open serial-chain mechanism with a fixed base equals the dimension of its configuration space, in turn equal to the number of independent generalized coordinates needed to specify its configuration, compute the mobility $M$ of this limb model from its anatomical joint types and their degrees of freedom (degrees of freedom (DOF) per joint are taken as $3$ for a spherical joint and $1$ for a revolute joint). Then, verify whether this $M$ matches the minimal osteokinematic set needed to independently control shoulder flexion–extension, shoulder abduction–adduction, shoulder internal–external rotation, elbow flexion–extension, and forearm pronation–supination in three-dimensional reaching with the hand, under the modeling assumptions stated. Express the mobility $M$ as a dimensionless integer. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The mobility $M$ of a multibody system is defined as the dimension of its configuration manifold, which equals the number of independent generalized coordinates required to uniquely specify the configuration of the system. For an open serial kinematic chain with a fixed base, and under the assumptions that each joint contributes independent coordinates with no redundant constraints, the generalized coordinate vector can be constructed by stacking the joint coordinates. If joint $i$ contributes $f_{i}$ independent coordinates, then the total number of independent generalized coordinates is\n$$\nM = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_{i},\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of joints in the chain. This follows directly from the independence of the joint coordinates and the absence of closed-loop constraints or base mobility.\n\nIn the limb model described, there are $n=3$ joints:\n- Joint $1$ is spherical with $f_{1} = 3$ rotational DOF (three independent rotations).\n- Joint $2$ is revolute with $f_{2} = 1$ rotational DOF (single-axis flexion–extension at the elbow).\n- Joint $3$ is revolute with $f_{3} = 1$ rotational DOF (single-axis pronation–supination of the forearm).\n\nTherefore, by summing the independent contributions,\n$$\nM = f_{1} + f_{2} + f_{3} = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n$$\n\nVerification of compatibility with human movement under the stated criterion proceeds by mapping the computed mobility to the required independent osteokinematic motions. The criterion specifies that the minimal set for three-dimensional reaching with the hand includes five motions: shoulder flexion–extension, shoulder abduction–adduction, shoulder internal–external rotation, elbow flexion–extension, and forearm pronation–supination. The spherical joint at the shoulder accounts for three independent rotational DOF corresponding to the shoulder motions (flexion–extension, abduction–adduction, internal–external rotation). The elbow revolute joint accounts for one DOF (flexion–extension). The forearm revolute joint accounts for one DOF (pronation–supination). Under the assumptions of independence and fixed base, these five motions are independent and span the required five-dimensional set.\n\nThus, the computed mobility $M = 5$ matches the minimal osteokinematic set defined in the problem, and the model is compatible with the specified human movement requirement within the modeling assumptions.",

            "problem": "A lower-limb kinematic chain is modeled using joint classification and terminology common in biomechanics. Consider an open serial chain comprising the pelvis–hip joint (spherical), knee joint (modified hinge), ankle joint (hinge), and subtalar joint (hinge). Let the number of links, including the ground (pelvis) link, be $N=5$. The spherical joint has $f=3$ degrees of freedom (DOF), each hinge joint has $f=1$ DOF, and the modified hinge joint can be treated as $f\\approx 1$ for mobility classification. Using only foundational principles that (i) each unconstrained rigid body in three-dimensional space possesses $6$ DOF and (ii) each joint imposes constraints equal to the difference between $6$ and the joint’s remaining relative DOF, derive a general expression for the mobility $M$ of a three-dimensional open serial chain in terms of $N$ and the set of joint DOF $\\{f_i\\}$.

No rounding is required for the final numerical answer.",
            "solution": "The solution involves deriving a general expression for the mobility of a three-dimensional open serial kinematic chain, applying this expression to the lower-limb model, and interpreting the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the General Mobility Expression**\n\nLet us derive the general expression for mobility, $M$. Consider a general open serial chain in three-dimensional space with $N$ links. One link is designated as the fixed base or ground link. This leaves $n = N-1$ moving links.\n\nAccording to principle (i) from the problem, if each of these $n$ moving links were unconstrained, each would possess $6$ degrees of freedom. The total potential DOF of the system of disconnected moving links would be $6n = 6(N-1)$.\n\nThe links are connected by joints. An open serial chain with $N$ links has $J = N-1$ joints. Let the degrees of freedom for the $i$-th joint be denoted by $f_i$, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $J$. A joint connects two adjacent links, thereby constraining their relative motion. According to principle (ii) from the problem, the number of constraints, $c_i$, imposed by the $i$-th joint is given by the number of DOF it removes from the total possible $6$ relative DOF between two rigid bodies.\n$$c_i = 6 - f_i$$\n\nThe total number of constraints, $C_{total}$, imposed on the entire chain is the sum of the constraints from all individual joints.\n$$C_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{J} c_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (6 - f_i)$$\n\nThe mobility, $M$, of the kinematic chain is defined as the number of independent parameters needed to specify the configuration of the system. It is calculated by subtracting the total number of independent constraints from the total potential degrees of freedom of the moving links.\n$$M = (\\text{Total potential DOF}) - (\\text{Total constraints})$$\n$$M = 6(N-1) - \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (6 - f_i)$$\n\nWe can now simplify this expression:\n$$M = 6(N-1) - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} 6 - \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f_i \\right)$$\nThe term $\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} 6$ is simply $6$ added $N-1$ times, which equals $6(N-1)$.\n$$M = 6(N-1) - 6(N-1) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f_i$$\nThis simplifies to the general expression for the mobility of a three-dimensional open serial chain:\n$$M = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f_i$$\nThis result demonstrates that the mobility of an open serial chain is simply the sum of the degrees of freedom of all its joints.\n\n**Part 2: Application to the Lower-Limb Chain**\n\nWe now apply this derived formula to the specific lower-limb model provided. The chain has $N=5$ links, which means it has $N-1=4$ joints. The degrees of freedom for these joints are given as:\n- Hip joint (spherical): $f_1 = 3$\n- Knee joint (modified hinge): $f_2 = 1$\n- Ankle joint (hinge): $f_3 = 1$\n- Subtalar joint (hinge): $f_4 = 1$\n\nUsing our derived formula, the mobility $M$ of this chain is the sum of the DOFs of these four joints:\n$$M = f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + f_4$$\n$$M = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1$$\n$$M = 6$$\n\nThe calculated mobility of the model lower-limb chain is $6$.\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation**\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for an interpretation of this result in the context of gait, specifically regarding kinematic redundancy for placing the foot in an arbitrary spatial pose relative to the pelvis.\n\nAn arbitrary spatial pose of a rigid body (the foot) relative to a reference frame (attached to the pelvis) is fully specified by $6$ independent coordinates: $3$ for position (e.g., $x, y, z$) and $3$ for orientation (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw). Thus, the task of placing the foot in an arbitrary pose requires control over $6$ degrees of freedom.\n\nOur calculation shows that the mobility of the open-chain lower limb during the swing phase is $M=6$. This means that the number of available degrees of freedom in the limb model is exactly equal to the number of degrees of freedom required to accomplish the specified task.\n\nKinematic redundancy is defined as having more available degrees of freedom than are minimally required to perform a task. In this case, the number of available DOF ($M=6$) is equal to the task-space DOF ($6$). Therefore, the chain is **not kinematically redundant** for the task of achieving an arbitrary spatial pose of the foot. It has the exact number of degrees of freedom needed. This implies that for any given attainable foot pose, there is a discrete, finite set of joint configurations, and not a continuous family of solutions, that can achieve it. In many cases, for a non-redundant manipulator, a given end-effector pose corresponds to a unique joint configuration (ignoring multiple solutions arising from the trigonometry of the inverse kinematics).",

            "solution": "The task is to classify the joint as either a ball-and-socket ($3$ rotational DOF) or a condyloid ($2$ rotational DOF with constrained spin), based on the provided experimental data.\n\n**Analysis of Evidence:**\n\n1.  **Range of Motion (ROM) from Neutral:**\n    - The joint exhibits a large ROM in flexion-extension ($\\theta_x = 110^\\circ$) and a substantial ROM in abduction-adduction ($\\theta_y = 50^\\circ$).\n    - In stark contrast, the primary ROM in axial rotation is very limited ($\\theta_z = 14^\\circ$).\n    - This disparity in ROM magnitude suggests that motion is not equally free in all three directions. A true ball-and-socket joint would typically exhibit large ROMs about all three axes.\n\n2.  **Coupling Behavior from Neutral:**\n    - The definition of independence (ii) states that applying a force for one coordinate should not cause *obligatory* changes in others.\n    - When a pure moment $M_z$ is applied, it results not only in a primary rotation $\\theta_z = 14^\\circ$ but also significant secondary rotations: $\\theta_x = 18^\\circ$ and $\\theta_y = 12^\\circ$.\n    - Critically, the secondary flexion rotation ($\\theta_x = 18^\\circ$) is *larger* than the primary axial rotation ($\\theta_z = 14^\\circ$). This is a profound violation of rotational independence. It is impossible to achieve a pure axial rotation by applying a pure axial moment. This strongly argues against $3$ independent rotational DOF.\n    - The compliance matrix further supports this. The off-diagonal term $C_{13} = 0.11$ rad/($\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$) represents the flexion rotation per unit of axial moment. This value is comparable to the primary axial compliance $C_{33} = 0.12$ rad/($\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$), indicating strong coupling between these two motions even for small displacements near neutral.\n\n3.  **Conjunct Rotation Behavior:**\n    - A key piece of evidence is the test from a prepositioned flexed posture.\n    - At neutral, a $5\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$ axial moment produces only $14^\\circ$ of axial rotation.\n    - When the joint is first flexed to $\\theta_x = 60^\\circ$, the same $5\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$ axial moment produces a total of $38^\\circ$ of axial rotation.\n    - This demonstrates that the joint's capacity for axial rotation is not constant but is strongly dependent on the amount of flexion. This phenomenon, where motion about one axis (axial rotation) becomes available or changes as a function of position along another axis (flexion-extension), is precisely what is defined as **conjunct rotation**.\n    - This observation directly matches the description of a condyloid joint: \"axial spin constrained...and often expressed as conjunct rotation coupled to flexion–extension\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly supports the classification of the joint as **condyloid**. The axial rotation is not an independent degree of freedom. It is severely restricted at the neutral position and is tightly coupled to flexion-extension, manifesting as conjunct rotation. The joint behaves as a system with two primary, more independent rotational degrees of freedom (flexion-extension and abduction-adduction) and one constrained, dependent rotation (axial spin).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Ball-and-socket, because the large ROM about all three axes and near-diagonal rotational compliance indicate $3$ independent rotational DOF with negligible coupling.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement contains multiple false premises. First, the ROM is not large about all three axes; it is small for axial rotation ($14^\\circ$). Second, the compliance matrix is not \"near-diagonal\" with respect to the third axis, as $C_{13}$ is comparable to $C_{33}$. Third, the coupling is far from negligible, as demonstrated by the large-rotation test where a pure axial moment produced more secondary flexion than primary axial rotation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Condyloid, because axial rotation is limited at neutral and predominantly emerges as conjunct rotation coupled with flexion–extension and abduction–adduction, indicating 2 independent rotational DOF with constrained spin.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement accurately reflects the experimental findings. Axial rotation is indeed limited at neutral ($14^\\circ$). The concept of conjunct rotation is directly demonstrated by the test at $\\theta_x = 60^\\circ$, where axial rotation capacity increased from $14^\\circ$ to $38^\\circ$. This behavior is the hallmark of a system with $2$ primary rotational DOF and a constrained, coupled spin, matching the definition of a condyloid joint.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Ball-and-socket, because the sum of the three end-range rotations exceeds $150^\\circ$, which necessarily implies 3 rotational DOF.**\n- **Analysis**: The premise is that the sum of ROMs ($110^\\circ + 50^\\circ + 14^\\circ = 174^\\circ$) determines the number of DOFs. This is a logical fallacy. The number of DOFs is determined by the *independence* of the motions, not the sum of their ranges. A 2-DOF system can have a very large total excursion. This criterion is invented and has no basis in mechanics or biomechanics.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Condyloid, because it possesses 2 rotational DOF and 1 translational DOF, as evidenced by nonzero off-axis rotations under pure axial moment.**\n- **Analysis**: While the classification as \"Condyloid\" is correct, the justification is flawed. The problem states that \"translations are actively minimized,\" so there is no basis to claim the existence of a translational DOF. The evidence cited—\"nonzero off-axis rotations\"—points to *rotational* coupling, not translation. The reasoning incorrectly links evidence for rotational dependence to a conclusion about translation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
