            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a standard problem in continuum mechanics applied to the biomechanics of soft tissues. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive the one-dimensional axial stress-strain relation for a linear elastic material under confined compression (oedometric conditions), identify the aggregate modulus $H_A$, compute its value for the given material properties of articular cartilage, and provide a physical explanation for why $H_A$ is greater than the Young’s modulus $E_s$.\n\nLet the axial direction be denoted by the $z$-axis. The applied stress is the axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$, and the corresponding strain is the axial strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$. The confined compression condition implies that there is no strain in the lateral directions. In a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$, this means the radial strain $\\epsilon_{rr}$ and the hoop strain $\\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta}$ are both zero.\n$$ \\epsilon_{rr} = 0 $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = 0 $$\nDue to the axial symmetry of the problem, the lateral stresses are equal: $\\sigma_{rr} = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$.\n\nThe constitutive relations for a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic solid (Hooke's Law) relate the components of strain to the components of stress. The strains in the principal directions are given by:\n$$ \\epsilon_{rr} = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_{rr} - \\nu_s (\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} + \\sigma_{zz}) \\right] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} - \\nu_s (\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{zz}) \\right] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu_s (\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}) \\right] $$\nwhere $E_s$ is the Young's modulus of the solid matrix and $\\nu_s$ is its Poisson's ratio.\n\nApplying the oedometric constraint $\\epsilon_{rr} = 0$ and the condition $\\sigma_{rr} = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ to the first equation yields:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_{rr} - \\nu_s (\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{zz}) \\right] $$\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = \\nu_s (\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{zz}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} (1 - \\nu_s) = \\nu_s \\sigma_{zz} $$\nThis allows us to express the required lateral confining stress $\\sigma_{rr}$ in terms of the applied axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = \\frac{\\nu_s}{1 - \\nu_s} \\sigma_{zz} $$\nSince $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\sigma_{rr}$, we have $\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = 2 \\sigma_{rr}$.\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for the lateral stresses into the constitutive equation for the axial strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu_s (2 \\sigma_{rr}) \\right] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E_s} \\left[ \\sigma_{zz} - 2\\nu_s \\left( \\frac{\\nu_s}{1 - \\nu_s} \\sigma_{zz} \\right) \\right] $$\nFactoring out $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{\\sigma_{zz}}{E_s} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{2\\nu_s^2}{1 - \\nu_s} \\right] $$\nTo simplify the term in the brackets, we use a common denominator:\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{\\sigma_{zz}}{E_s} \\left[ \\frac{(1 - \\nu_s) - 2\\nu_s^2}{1 - \\nu_s} \\right] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{\\sigma_{zz}}{E_s} \\frac{1 - \\nu_s - 2\\nu_s^2}{1 - \\nu_s} $$\nThe numerator can be factored as $1 - \\nu_s - 2\\nu_s^2 = (1 + \\nu_s)(1 - 2\\nu_s)$.\n$$ \\epsilon_{zz} = \\sigma_{zz} \\frac{(1 + \\nu_s)(1 - 2\\nu_s)}{E_s(1 - \\nu_s)} $$\nThe problem asks for the one-dimensional axial stress-strain relation, which is conventionally written as stress as a function of strain. Rearranging the above equation, we find:\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = \\left[ \\frac{E_s(1 - \\nu_s)}{(1 + \\nu_s)(1 - 2\\nu_s)} \\right] \\epsilon_{zz} $$\nThis is the desired one-dimensional stress-strain relation at mechanical equilibrium.\n\nThe aggregate modulus $H_A$ is defined as the proportionality constant between axial stress and axial strain in this confined compression limit, i.e., $\\sigma_{zz} = H_A \\epsilon_{zz}$. By direct comparison with the derived relation, we identify the aggregate modulus as:\n$$ H_A = \\frac{E_s(1 - \\nu_s)}{(1 + \\nu_s)(1 - 2\\nu_s)} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $H_A$ using the provided material parameters: $E_s = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\nu_s = 0.15$.\n$$ H_A = \\frac{1.2\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\times (1 - 0.15)}{(1 + 0.15) \\times (1 - 2 \\times 0.15)} $$\n$$ H_A = \\frac{1.2 \\times 0.85}{1.15 \\times (1 - 0.30)} $$\n$$ H_A = \\frac{1.02}{1.15 \\times 0.70} $$\n$$ H_A = \\frac{1.02}{0.805} \\approx 1.26708\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the numerical value is $H_A = 1.267\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nFinally, we explain from first principles why the aggregate modulus $H_A$ exceeds the Young's modulus $E_s$ for a material with a positive Poisson's ratio ($0 < \\nu_s < \\frac{1}{2}$).\nThe Young's modulus, $E_s$, is defined as the ratio of axial stress to axial strain in a simple uniaxial test where the material is free to deform laterally. When a material with $\\nu_s > 0$ is compressed axially, it tends to expand in the lateral directions.\nIn a confined compression test, this lateral expansion is prevented by the rigid confining chamber ($\\epsilon_{rr} = \\epsilon_{\\theta\\theta} = 0$). To prevent this expansion, the chamber walls must exert a compressive stress ($\\sigma_{rr} = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} < 0$) on the specimen. This lateral compressive stress, through the Poisson effect, induces an axial elongation (a tensile strain component) that opposes the axial compression caused by the applied stress $\\sigma_{zz}$.\nThis is evident from the axial strain equation: $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E_s} [ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu_s (\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}) ]$. Since $\\sigma_{rr}$ and $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$ are compressive (negative) and $\\nu_s$ is positive, the term $-\\nu_s (\\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta})$ is positive, representing a tensile contribution to the total axial strain.\nConsequently, to achieve a given amount of net axial compression $\\epsilon_{zz}$, a larger axial stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ must be applied in confined compression compared to unconfined compression. The material acts stiffer. Since the modulus is the ratio of stress to strain, the modulus measured in confined compression ($H_A = \\sigma_{zz}/\\epsilon_{zz}$) is greater than the modulus measured in unconfined compression ($E_s$).\nMathematically, this corresponds to the factor relating $H_A$ and $E_s$ being greater than $1$. We must show that $\\frac{1 - \\nu_s}{(1 + \\nu_s)(1 - 2\\nu_s)} > 1$ for $0 < \\nu_s < \\frac{1}{2}$. This inequality is equivalent to $1 - \\nu_s > (1 + \\nu_s)(1 - 2\\nu_s)$, which simplifies to $1 - \\nu_s > 1 - \\nu_s - 2\\nu_s^2$. This further simplifies to $0 > -2\\nu_s^2$, or $2\\nu_s^2 > 0$, which is always true for any non-zero $\\nu_s$.",

            "problem": "A full-thickness articular cartilage layer of thickness $h$ is tested in confined compression creep under a step load, within the small-strain linear biphasic framework. The tissue is modeled as a porous-permeable solid matrix saturated with interstitial fluid. The solid matrix is linearly elastic with aggregate modulus $H_A$, the interstitial fluid is inviscid and incompressible, and both constituents are intrinsically incompressible. Flow follows Darcy’s law with hydraulic permeability $k$. The top and bottom faces at $z=0$ and $z=h$ are perfectly drained, and lateral strain is constrained to zero (confined compression).

            "solution": "The problem requires us to deduce the scaling of the dominant consolidation time constant, $\\tau_1$, for a cartilage layer under confined compression, based on its thickness $h$, hydraulic permeability $k$, and aggregate modulus $H_A$. We must start from fundamental principles of the linear biphasic theory.\n\nThe fundamental relations are:\n1.  **Mass Conservation (Continuity):** For a mixture of intrinsically incompressible solid and fluid constituents, the divergence of the total volume-averaged velocity is zero. This can be expressed in terms of the solid phase velocity, $\\mathbf{v}^s$, and the relative fluid flux (Darcy velocity), $\\mathbf{w}$, as $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}^s + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0$. The solid velocity is the material time derivative of the solid displacement, $\\mathbf{v}^s = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^s}{\\partial t}$. The divergence of the solid velocity is the rate of change of the volumetric strain (dilatation) of the solid matrix, $e = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}^s$. Therefore, the continuity equation becomes $\\frac{\\partial e}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w}$. For the one-dimensional ($1$D) case of confined compression in the $z$-direction, the strain is $\\epsilon_{zz}(z,t) = \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z}$, and the continuity equation simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial w_z}{\\partial z}\n    $$\n    where $w_z$ is the $z$-component of the relative fluid flux.\n\n2.  **Darcy's Law:** The flow of the interstitial fluid relative to the solid matrix is driven by the gradient of the interstitial fluid pressure, $p$. This relationship is given by Darcy's law: $\\mathbf{w} = -k \\nabla p$. In $1$D, this is:\n    $$\n    w_z = -k \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Constitutive Law (Linear Elasticity and Force Balance):** In a confined compression test, the total applied stress, $\\sigma_{app}$, is constant and balanced by the stress in the solid matrix and the fluid pressure. The total stress in the $z$-direction, $\\sigma_{zz}$, is the sum of the effective stress on the solid matrix, $\\sigma^e_{zz}$, and the fluid pressure contribution, $-p$. So, $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma^e_{zz} - p$. The solid matrix is modeled as linearly elastic, so under the confined compression condition (zero lateral strain), the effective stress is related to the axial strain by the aggregate modulus, $H_A$: $\\sigma^e_{zz} = H_A \\epsilon_{zz}$. The total stress is constant and equal to the applied load per area, so $\\sigma_{zz} = -\\sigma_{app}$. Combining these gives:\n    $$\n    -\\sigma_{app} = H_A \\epsilon_{zz} - p\n    $$\n    This can be rearranged to express the pressure $p$ in terms of the strain $\\epsilon_{zz}$:\n    $$\n    p = H_A \\epsilon_{zz} + \\sigma_{app}\n    $$\n\nNow, we combine these three fundamental relations to derive the governing partial differential equation (PDE) for consolidation.\nFirst, substitute Darcy's law into the continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left( -k \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} \\right) = k \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\n(assuming the permeability $k$ is uniform throughout the tissue).\nNext, substitute the expression for pressure $p$ from the constitutive relation into this equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2} (H_A \\epsilon_{zz} + \\sigma_{app})\n$$\nSince $H_A$ is a constant modulus and $\\sigma_{app}$ is a constant applied stress, the spatial derivative of $\\sigma_{app}$ is zero. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = H_A k \\frac{\\partial^2 \\epsilon_{zz}}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nThis is the one-dimensional consolidation equation. It is a diffusion-type PDE, where the diffusing quantity is the solid matrix strain $\\epsilon_{zz}(z,t)$. The equation is of the form $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$, where the consolidation coefficient or diffusivity, $D$, is given by the product $D = H_A k$.\n\nThe time constant of any diffusion process is determined by the diffusivity $D$ and the characteristic length $L$ over which diffusion occurs. By dimensional analysis, the diffusion coefficient $D$ has units of $[Length]^2/[Time]$. Therefore, the characteristic time $\\tau$ must scale as $\\tau \\propto \\frac{L^2}{D}$.\n\nIn this problem, the consolidation process (diffusion of strain and pressure) occurs across the thickness of the cartilage layer, $h$. The boundary conditions are perfectly drained at $z=0$ and $z=h$, which makes the full thickness $h$ the characteristic length of the system. Therefore, we set $L=h$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $L$ and $D$, we deduce the scaling for the consolidation time constant:\n$$\n\\tau \\propto \\frac{h^2}{H_A k}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\tau_1$ is the slowest (dominant) time constant, which corresponds to the fundamental mode of the diffusion process. This scaling relationship applies to $\\tau_1$. Let this proportionality be expressed as $\\tau_1 = C \\frac{h^2}{H_A k}$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality (determined by boundary conditions, which in this case would make $C=1/\\pi^2$, but its value is not needed).\n\nNow, we use this scaling relationship to determine the multiplicative change in $\\tau_1$. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript 'initial' and the final state by 'final'.\nThe initial time constant is:\n$$\n\\tau_{1, \\text{initial}} = C \\frac{h_{\\text{initial}}^2}{H_{A, \\text{initial}} k_{\\text{initial}}}\n$$\nThe parameters are changed as follows:\n-   Thickness doubles: $h_{\\text{final}} = 2 h_{\\text{initial}}$\n-   Permeability halves: $k_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\text{initial}}$\n-   Aggregate modulus is unchanged: $H_{A, \\text{final}} = H_{A, \\text{initial}}$\n\nThe final time constant is:\n$$\n\\tau_{1, \\text{final}} = C \\frac{h_{\\text{final}}^2}{H_{A, \\text{final}} k_{\\text{final}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the new parameter values:\n$$\n\\tau_{1, \\text{final}} = C \\frac{(2 h_{\\text{initial}})^2}{H_{A, \\text{initial}} (\\frac{1}{2} k_{\\text{initial}})} = C \\frac{4 h_{\\text{initial}}^2}{\\frac{1}{2} H_{A, \\text{initial}} k_{\\text{initial}}} = 8 \\left( C \\frac{h_{\\text{initial}}^2}{H_{A, \\text{initial}} k_{\\text{initial}}} \\right)\n$$\nBy comparing this with the expression for the initial time constant, we find:\n$$\n\\tau_{1, \\text{final}} = 8 \\, \\tau_{1, \\text{initial}}\n$$\nThe multiplicative change in $\\tau_1$ is the ratio $\\frac{\\tau_{1, \\text{final}}}{\\tau_{1, \\text{initial}}}$, which is $8$.
