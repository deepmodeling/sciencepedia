            "problem": "A compressive load $W$ is transmitted across a human tibiofemoral contact modeled as a frictionless, axisymmetric contact between a rigid spherical surface of radius $R$ and a cartilage layer that is linearly elastic, homogeneous, and isotropic, with Young’s modulus $E$, Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$, and thickness $h$, perfectly bonded to a rigid subchondral substrate. Consider the short-time, purely elastic limit in which fluid flow is negligible, so the cartilage response can be approximated as an elastic half-space characterized by the effective modulus $E^{\\ast}$ determined by linear elasticity. Assume small strains and that the pressure distribution is governed by classical Hertz contact mechanics under the stated assumptions.\n\nStarting from the fundamental laws of mechanics (force equilibrium and compatibility) and the linear elastic constitutive relation (Hooke’s law), together with the well-tested Hertz theory for axisymmetric, frictionless contact between a rigid sphere and an elastic half-space, derive an expression for the peak contact pressure $p_{0}$ as a function of $E$, $\\nu$, $h$, $R$, and $W$. Then, perform a local sensitivity analysis of $p_{0}$ with respect to the parameter vector $(E,\\nu,h,R)$ by computing the normalized partial sensitivities defined by\n$$\ns_{x} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln\\!\\left(p_{0}\\right)}{\\partial \\ln\\!\\left(x\\right)} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad x \\in \\{E,\\nu,h,R\\}.\n$$\nEvaluate $s_{E}$, $s_{\\nu}$, $s_{h}$, and $s_{R}$ symbolically, and identify the most influential parameter at the baseline Poisson’s ratio $\\nu = 0.45$ by comparing the magnitudes $\\left|s_{x}\\right|$.

            "solution": "The problem describes the contact between a rigid sphere of radius $R$ and an elastic body modeled as a half-space. This is a classic Hertz contact problem.\n\nFirst, we define the effective Young's modulus, $E^*$, for the contact. For two elastic bodies with properties $(E_1, \\nu_1)$ and $(E_2, \\nu_2)$, the relationship is given by $\\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \\frac{1-\\nu_2^2}{E_2}$. In this problem, one surface is a rigid sphere, which can be modeled with an infinite Young's modulus, $E_1 \\rightarrow \\infty$. The other surface is the cartilage with Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1-\\nu_1^2}{\\infty} + \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E} = 0 + \\frac{1-\\nu^2}{E}\n$$\nThis gives the effective modulus for the contact as:\n$$\nE^* = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\n$$\nAccording to Hertz contact theory, for a spherical indenter of radius $R$ pressing into an elastic half-space with a total applied load $W$, the peak pressure is given by:\n$$\np_0 = \\left(\\frac{6W(E^*)^2}{\\pi^3 R^2}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nNow, we substitute $E^* = E/(1-\\nu^2)$ into this expression:\n$$\np_0 = \\left(\\frac{6W}{\\pi^3 R^2} \\left(\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\right)^2\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(\\frac{6WE^2}{\\pi^3 R^2 (1-\\nu^2)^2}\\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the peak contact pressure $p_0$ as a function of $E$, $\\nu$, $R$, and $W$. As the problem specifies modeling the cartilage as an elastic half-space, the thickness $h$ does not appear in the formulation, because a half-space is infinitely thick by definition.\n\nNext, we perform the sensitivity analysis. The normalized sensitivity of $p_0$ with respect to a parameter $x$ is defined as $s_x = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(p_0)}{\\partial \\ln(x)}$. First, we take the natural logarithm of $p_0$:\n$$\n\\ln(p_0) = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{6WE^2}{\\pi^3 R^2 (1-\\nu^2)^2}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms:\n$$\n\\ln(p_0) = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ \\ln(6) + \\ln(W) + 2\\ln(E) - 3\\ln(\\pi) - 2\\ln(R) - 2\\ln(1-\\nu^2) \\right]\n$$\nNow we compute the partial sensitivities.\nFor the Young's modulus $E$:\n$$\ns_E = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(p_0)}{\\partial \\ln(E)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln(E)}\\left[\\frac{2}{3}\\ln(E)\\right] = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nFor the sphere radius $R$:\n$$\ns_R = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(p_0)}{\\partial \\ln(R)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln(R)}\\left[-\\frac{2}{3}\\ln(R)\\right] = -\\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nFor the cartilage thickness $h$:\nSince $p_0$ is not a function of $h$ in the half-space model, its logarithm is also not a function of $h$.\n$$\ns_h = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(p_0)}{\\partial \\ln(h)} = 0\n$$\nFor the Poisson's ratio $\\nu$:\nThe sensitivity is $s_\\nu = \\frac{\\partial \\ln(p_0)}{\\partial \\ln(\\nu)}$.

Since for an elastic material $0 \\le \\nu < 0.5$, this expression is always non-negative.\n\nWe evaluate $|s_\\nu|$ at $\\nu = 0.45$:\n$$\n|s_\\nu| = \\frac{4(0.45)^2}{3(1-0.45^2)} = \\frac{4(0.2025)}{3(1-0.2025)} = \\frac{0.81}{3(0.7975)} = \\frac{0.81}{2.3925} \\approx 0.3385\n$$\nNow we compare the magnitudes. We have $|s_E| = |s_R| = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.667$, $|s_h|=0$, and $|s_\\nu| \\approx 0.339$.\nThe largest magnitude is $\\frac{2}{3}$.

The final result for each test case is the total count of grid points $(x_j, y_k)$ for which the condition $w(x_j, y_k) \\ge w_{\\text{thr, m}}$ is satisfied. This is achieved by creating a boolean mask of the grid and summing the `True` values. This procedure is implemented for each test case to yield a count of high-risk points.",
