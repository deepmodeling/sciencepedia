Assume the tendon is taut at its slack length and undergoes small to moderate extension such that engineering measures are appropriate.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics as applied to biomechanics, is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the SE Force-Strain Relation**\n\nThe problem states that the Cauchy stress in the tendon, $\\sigma$, is a quadratic function of the engineering strain, $\\epsilon$. A general quadratic relationship that satisfies the physical condition of zero stress at zero strain ($\\sigma(0)=0$) can be written as:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\epsilon) = \\alpha \\epsilon + \\beta \\epsilon^2\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the two material coefficients provided. Both coefficients must have units of pressure (Pascals, Pa) for the equation to be dimensionally consistent, as strain $\\epsilon$ is dimensionless.\n\nThe problem also defines Cauchy stress as the force transmitted, $F_{\\mathrm{SE}}$, divided by the cross-sectional area, which is assumed constant and equal to the reference area $A_{\\mathrm{t}}$ for small strains:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{A_{\\mathrm{t}}}\n$$\nBy equating these two expressions for stress, we can derive the force-strain relation for the series elastic (SE) element:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{\\mathrm{SE}}}{A_{\\mathrm{t}}} = \\alpha \\epsilon + \\beta \\epsilon^2\n$$\nSolving for the force $F_{\\mathrm{SE}}$ as a function of strain $\\epsilon$ yields:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\epsilon) = A_{\\mathrm{t}} (\\alpha \\epsilon + \\beta \\epsilon^2)\n$$\nThis can be expanded to:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\epsilon) = (A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\alpha) \\epsilon + (A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\beta) \\epsilon^2\n$$\nThe problem asks to identify effective coefficients $k_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and $h_{\\mathrm{t}}$ for a relation of the form $F_{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\epsilon) = k_{\\mathrm{t}} \\epsilon + h_{\\mathrm{t}} \\epsilon^2$. By direct comparison, we find:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{t}} = A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\alpha\n$$\n$$\nh_{\\mathrm{t}} = A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\beta\n$$\nThe units of both $k_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and $h_{\\mathrm{t}}$ are force (Newtons, N), since $A_{\\mathrm{t}}$ is in $\\mathrm{m}^2$ and both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are in $\\mathrm{Pa} = \\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Tendon Elongation**\n\nFor a static task, the muscle-tendon unit (MTU) is in equilibrium. The force in the SE element is equal to the total force transmitted by the MTU: $F_{\\mathrm{SE}} = F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$.\nWe can substitute this into our derived force-strain relationship:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = (A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\alpha) \\epsilon + (A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\beta) \\epsilon^2\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the engineering strain $\\epsilon$. Rearranging it into standard form ($ax^2 + bx + c = 0$) gives:\n$$\n(A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\beta) \\epsilon^2 + (A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\alpha) \\epsilon - F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = 0\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n- $A_{\\mathrm{t}} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^2$\n- $\\alpha = 1.0 \\times 10^{9}~\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\beta = 3.0 \\times 10^{9}~\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = 1800~\\mathrm{N}$\n\nFirst, we compute the coefficients of the quadratic equation:\nThe coefficient of $\\epsilon^2$ is $a = A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\beta = (50 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^2) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{9}~\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2) = 1.5 \\times 10^5~\\mathrm{N}$.\nThe coefficient of $\\epsilon$ is $b = A_{\\mathrm{t}} \\alpha = (50 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^2) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{9}~\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2) = 5.0 \\times 10^4~\\mathrm{N}$.\nThe constant term is $c = -F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = -1800~\\mathrm{N}$.\n\nThe equation to solve for $\\epsilon$ is:\n$$\n(1.5 \\times 10^5) \\epsilon^2 + (5.0 \\times 10^4) \\epsilon - 1800 = 0\n$$\nWe use the quadratic formula to find the roots for $\\epsilon$:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the discriminant, $D = b^2 - 4ac$:\n$$\nD = (5.0 \\times 10^4)^2 - 4(1.5 \\times 10^5)(-1800) = 2.5 \\times 10^9 + 1.08 \\times 10^9 = 3.58 \\times 10^9~\\mathrm{N}^2\n$$\nNow we find the roots:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{-5.0 \\times 10^4 \\pm \\sqrt{3.58 \\times 10^9}}{2(1.5 \\times 10^5)} = \\frac{-50000 \\pm 59833.1}{300000}\n$$\nThe two roots are:\n$$\n\\epsilon_1 = \\frac{-50000 + 59833.1}{300000} = \\frac{9833.1}{300000} \\approx 0.032777\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_2 = \\frac{-50000 - 59833.1}{300000} \\approx -0.36611\n$$\nThe problem requires the physically meaningful root, corresponding to tendon tension and positive elongation.

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Normalized Force-Velocity Relation\n\nThe derivation begins with the given empirical law for the Hill-type muscle model. Our objective is to re-express this law in terms of the normalized variables $\\tilde{F}$ and $\\tilde{v}$.\n\nFirst, we determine an expression for the maximum unloaded shortening velocity, $v_{\\max}$. By definition, this is the velocity $v$ when the force $F$ is zero. We substitute $F=0$ and $v=v_{\\max}$ into the Hill equation:\n$$(F + a)\\,v = b\\,(F_{0} - F)$$\n$$(0 + a)\\,v_{\\max} = b\\,(F_{0} - 0)$$\n$$a\\,v_{\\max} = b\\,F_{0}$$\nSolving for $v_{\\max}$ yields a relationship between the model parameters:\n$$v_{\\max} = \\frac{b\\,F_{0}}{a}$$\n\nNext, we express the original variables $F$ and $v$ in terms of the new dimensionless variables $\\tilde{F}$ and $\\tilde{v}$. From their definitions:\n$$\\tilde{F} = \\frac{F}{F_{0}} \\implies F = \\tilde{F}F_{0}$$\n$$\\tilde{v} = \\frac{v}{v_{\\max}} \\implies v = \\tilde{v}v_{\\max}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $F$ and $v$ back into the original Hill equation:\n$$(\\tilde{F}F_{0} + a)\\,(\\tilde{v}v_{\\max}) = b\\,(F_{0} - \\tilde{F}F_{0})$$\nThe right-hand side can be simplified by factoring out $F_{0}$:\n$$(\\tilde{F}F_{0} + a)\\,(\\tilde{v}v_{\\max}) = b\\,F_{0}\\,(1 - \\tilde{F})$$\n\nWe can now substitute the expression we derived for $v_{\\max}$:\n$$(\\tilde{F}F_{0} + a)\\,\\left(\\tilde{v} \\frac{b\\,F_{0}}{a}\\right) = b\\,F_{0}\\,(1 - \\tilde{F})$$\nSince $b$ and $F_{0}$ are positive constants, we can divide both sides by the non-zero term $b\\,F_{0}$:\n$$(\\tilde{F}F_{0} + a)\\,\\frac{\\tilde{v}}{a} = 1 - \\tilde{F}$$\nDistributing the term $\\frac{\\tilde{v}}{a}$ on the left-hand side gives:\n$$\\frac{\\tilde{F}F_{0}\\tilde{v}}{a} + \\frac{a\\tilde{v}}{a} = 1 - \\tilde{F}$$\n$$\\tilde{F}\\tilde{v}\\left(\\frac{F_{0}}{a}\\right) + \\tilde{v} = 1 - \\tilde{F}$$\n\nOur goal is to find an explicit expression for $\\tilde{F}$ as a function of $\\tilde{v}$. To do this, we collect all terms containing $\\tilde{F}$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\\tilde{F}\\tilde{v}\\left(\\frac{F_{0}}{a}\\right) + \\tilde{F} = 1 - \\tilde{v}$$\nFactor out $\\tilde{F}$ from the left-hand side:\n$$\\tilde{F}\\left(1 + \\tilde{v}\\left(\\frac{F_{0}}{a}\\right)\\right) = 1 - \\tilde{v}$$\nFinally, we isolate $\\tilde{F}$ by dividing both sides by the term in the parenthesis, which yields the normalized force-velocity relation:\n$$\\tilde{F}(\\tilde{v}) = \\frac{1 - \\tilde{v}}{1 + \\tilde{v}\\left(\\frac{F_{0}}{a}\\right)}$$\nThis expression gives the normalized force $\\tilde{F}$ as a function of the normalized velocity $\\tilde{v}$ and the dimensionless ratio $F_{0}/a$.\n\n### Rationale and Advantages of Normalization\n\nThe physical and methodological rationale for this normalization procedure is to create a universal framework for analyzing muscle function that is independent of the absolute scale of the muscle.\n\n1.  **Physical Rationale and Scale Separation**: Muscles vary enormously in size and strength, from the large leg muscles to the tiny intra-ocular muscles. Consequently, their absolute values for maximum force ($F_{0}$) and maximum velocity ($v_{\\max}$) can differ by orders of magnitude. A direct comparison of their force-velocity curves, $F(v)$, would be uninformative, as the curves would occupy completely different regions of a plot. Normalization by the physiologically relevant scaling parameters $F_{0}$ and $v_{\\max}$ rescales the performance of any muscle to a canonical domain where force $\\tilde{F}$ and velocity $\\tilde{v}$ both range from $0$ to $1$. This process separates the intrinsic properties of the muscle tissue from the extrinsic effects of its size.\n\n2.  **Invariance and Comparative Analysis**: The normalized curve $\\tilde{F}(\\tilde{v})$ reveals the intrinsic shape of the force-velocity relationship. This shape is determined by a single dimensionless parameter, the ratio $F_{0}/a$ (or its inverse, $a/F_{0}$). This ratio quantifies the curvature of the hyperbola; a high value of $F_{0}/a$ (low curvature) is typical of \"fast-twitch\" fibers that can maintain high force even at considerable shortening velocities, while a lower value (high curvature) is characteristic of \"slow-twitch\" fibers. By using the normalized representation, we can make meaningful, quantitative comparisons of the functional characteristics of muscle fibers across different muscles, individuals, or even species, regardless of their absolute strength or speed. For example, we can objectively determine if an athlete's muscle tissue has a more favorable force-velocity profile than a sedentary individual's, independent of the fact that the athlete's muscle is larger and stronger. This simplifies complex biological comparisons to the analysis of a single dimensionless parameter.",

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of kinematic relationships and analysis of dynamic plausibility.\n\nFirst, we establish the kinematic relationship between the muscle belly's line-of-action velocity, $v_m$, and the fiber velocity, $v_f$. The muscle belly projection along the line of action is given as $L_m = l_f \\cos \\phi$. We differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$ to find the velocity $v_m = \\frac{d L_m}{dt}$. Applying the product rule and chain rule for differentiation:\n$$v_m = \\frac{d}{dt}(l_f \\cos \\phi) = \\left(\\frac{d l_f}{dt}\\right) \\cos \\phi + l_f \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}(\\cos \\phi)\\right)$$\nRecognizing that $v_f = \\frac{d l_f}{dt}$ and $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\cos \\phi) = - \\sin \\phi \\frac{d \\phi}{dt}$, we can write:\n$$v_m = v_f \\cos \\phi - l_f \\sin \\phi \\frac{d\\phi}{dt}$$\nLetting $\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{d\\phi}{dt}$, this is the relationship linking $v_m$, $v_f$, and $\\dot{\\phi}$.\n\nNext, we use the incompressibility constraint, $l_f \\sin \\phi = c$, where $c$ is a constant, to eliminate $\\dot{\\phi}$. Differentiating the constraint with respect to time $t$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}(l_f \\sin \\phi) = \\frac{dc}{dt} = 0$$\nApplying the product rule:\n$$\\left(\\frac{d l_f}{dt}\\right) \\sin \\phi + l_f \\left(\\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin \\phi)\\right) = 0$$\n$$v_f \\sin \\phi + l_f (\\cos \\phi) \\dot{\\phi} = 0$$\nAssuming $\\cos \\phi \\neq 0$ (which is true for physiological pennation angles, typically $0 \\leq \\phi < 45^{\\circ}$), we can solve for $\\dot{\\phi}$:\n$$\\dot{\\phi} = -\\frac{v_f \\sin \\phi}{l_f \\cos \\phi} = -\\frac{v_f}{l_f} \\tan \\phi$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\dot{\\phi}$ back into our equation for $v_m$:\n$$v_m = v_f \\cos \\phi - l_f \\sin \\phi \\left(-\\frac{v_f \\sin \\phi}{l_f \\cos \\phi}\\right)$$\n$$v_m = v_f \\cos \\phi + v_f \\frac{\\sin^2 \\phi}{\\cos \\phi} = v_f \\left(\\cos \\phi + \\frac{\\sin^2 \\phi}{\\cos \\phi}\\right)$$\nCombining the terms in the parenthesis over a common denominator:\n$$v_m = v_f \\left(\\frac{\\cos^2 \\phi + \\sin^2 \\phi}{\\cos \\phi}\\right)$$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\cos^2 \\phi + \\sin^2 \\phi = 1$, we arrive at the simplified kinematic relationship:\n$$v_m = \\frac{v_f}{\\cos \\phi}$$\nThis equation explicitly defines the role of the pennation angle $\\phi$ in mapping fiber velocity $v_f$ to the muscle's line-of-action velocity $v_m$. The factor $1/\\cos\\phi$ acts as an \"architectural gear ratio\". Since $\\cos \\phi < 1$ for any non-zero pennation angle, it follows that $|v_m| > |v_f|$, meaning a given fiber velocity is amplified at the line of action.\n\nNow, we can establish the condition under which the fiber shortens ($v_f < 0$) while the MTU lengthens ($v_{\\text{MTU}} > 0$). The total MTU velocity is given by $v_{\\text{MTU}} = v_t + v_m$. Substituting our expression for $v_m$:\n$$v_{\\text{MTU}} = v_t + \\frac{v_f}{\\cos \\phi}$$\nFor the MTU to lengthen, $v_{\\text{MTU}} > 0$. For the fibers to shorten, $v_f < 0$. Combining these inequalities:\n$$v_t + \\frac{v_f}{\\cos \\phi} > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad v_f < 0$$\nThe first inequality can be rearranged to state the condition on $v_t$:\n$$v_t > -\\frac{v_f}{\\cos \\phi}$$\nSince $v_f$ is negative, $-v_f$ is a positive quantity. For typical pennation angles, $\\cos \\phi$ is also positive. Therefore, the condition is that the tendon lengthening velocity, $v_t$, must be positive and its magnitude must be greater than the magnitude of the muscle belly's shortening velocity, $|v_m| = |v_f / \\cos \\phi|$.\n\nThis state is dynamically plausible due to the interaction of the force projection and the force-velocity relationship.\n1. The force projection rule, $F_t = F_{ce} \\cos \\phi$, is a consequence of quasi-static force balance (an application of Newton's laws) at the junction where fibers attach. This can be rearranged to $F_{ce} = F_t / \\cos \\phi$. Because $\\cos \\phi < 1$ for $\\phi > 0$, the force experienced by the fiber, $F_{ce}$, is an amplified version of the force transmitted to the tendon, $F_t$.\n2. The Hill-type force-velocity relationship dictates that fibers shorten ($v_f < 0$) only when the force they bear is less than their isometric force capacity, i.e., $F_{ce} < F_0(l_f)$.\n3. The tendon, as a series elastic element, stretches when force is applied. A tendon velocity $v_t > 0$ means the tendon is actively stretching, which occurs when the force $F_t$ is sufficiently large.\nCombining these points, a scenario can arise where an external load causes the MTU to lengthen. This load generates a force $F_t$ in the tendon that is large enough to cause significant tendon stretch ($v_t > 0$). However, due to the pennation angle, the force experienced by the fibers is $F_{ce} = F_t / \\cos \\phi$. It is possible for $F_t$ to be large enough to cause $v_t > |v_m|$, while the amplified fiber force $F_{ce}$ remains below the fiber's isometric capacity $F_0(l_f)$. This allows the fibers to shorten ($v_f < 0$) and do work to stretch the compliant tendon, even as the overall MTU is being lengthened.\n\nPart 2: Numerical application.\n\nWe are asked to compute the sign of the fiber velocity $v_f$ given an instantaneous state. We use the kinematic equation derived above:\n$$v_{\\text{MTU}} = v_t + \\frac{v_f}{\\cos \\phi}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $v_f$:\n$$v_f = (v_{\\text{MTU}} - v_t) \\cos \\phi$$\nThe given numerical values are:\n$v_{\\text{MTU}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ m/s\n$v_t = 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ m/s\n$\\phi = 25^{\\circ}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $v_f$:\n$$v_f = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2} - 3.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\cos(25^{\\circ})$$\n$$v_f = (-1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\cos(25^{\\circ})$$\nTo determine the sign of $v_f$, we evaluate the signs of the terms on the right-hand side. The first term, $(-1.0 \\times 10^{-2})$, is negative. The second term, $\\cos(25^{\\circ})$, corresponds to an angle in the first quadrant, so its value is positive.\nThe product of a negative number and a positive number is negative.\n$$v_f < 0$$\nTherefore, the fiber is shortening at this instant. This corresponds to the integer code $-1$.",
