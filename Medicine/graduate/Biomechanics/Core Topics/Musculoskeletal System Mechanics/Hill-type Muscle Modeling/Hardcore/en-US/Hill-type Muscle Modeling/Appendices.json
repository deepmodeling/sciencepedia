            "problem": "A Hill-type musculotendon unit is modeled with pennated muscle fibers inserting between two parallel, inextensible aponeuroses. Let the musculotendon length be $l_{m}$, the free tendon length be $l_{t}$, the fascicle (fiber) length be $l_{f}$, and the pennation angle be $\\alpha$ (defined between the fiber axis and the line of action of the tendon). Under the standard geometric assumptions for this model: (i) the projection of the fiber along the line of action adds in series with the tendon, so $l_{m} = l_{t} + l_{f}\\cos\\alpha$, and (ii) the perpendicular distance between the aponeuroses is constant and equal to $w$, so the fiber thickness constraint is $w = l_{f}\\sin\\alpha$. Assume $l_{m}  l_{t} \\geq 0$ and $w  0$, so that $0  \\alpha  \\pi/2$.\n\nStarting from these constraints and from elementary geometric definitions of sine, cosine, and the Pythagorean theorem, derive closed-form expressions for $l_{f}$ and $\\alpha$ in terms of $l_{m}$, $l_{t}$, and $w$.

The equations are direct applications of trigonometry to this widely accepted model.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides two independent equations and seeks to find two unknowns, $l_f$ and $\\alpha$. The given conditions, $l_m  l_t$ and $w  0$, ensure that the denominators and arguments of functions in the anticipated solution are well-defined and physically meaningful. A unique solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and is free from any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\n\nThe problem is to solve for the fascicle length $l_f$ and the pennation angle $\\alpha$ from the given system of two equations:\n$$l_{m} = l_{t} + l_{f}\\cos\\alpha \\quad (1)$$\n$$w = l_{f}\\sin\\alpha \\quad (2)$$\n\nThe parameters $l_m$, $l_t$, and $w$ are known constants. We can rearrange equation $(1)$ to isolate the term containing the unknowns on one side:\n$$l_{f}\\cos\\alpha = l_{m} - l_{t} \\quad (3)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations:\n$$l_{f}\\sin\\alpha = w \\quad (2)$$\n$$l_{f}\\cos\\alpha = l_{m} - l_{t} \\quad (3)$$\n\nThese two equations can be interpreted geometrically. They represent the components of a vector of length $l_f$ oriented at an angle $\\alpha$. Alternatively, they describe a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse $l_f$. The side opposite to the angle $\\alpha$ has length $w$, and the side adjacent to $\\alpha$ has length $l_m - l_t$.\n\nTo find $l_f$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In our context, this corresponds to the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\sin^2\\alpha + \\cos^2\\alpha = 1$. Let us square both equations $(2)$ and $(3)$ and then add them together:\n$$(l_{f}\\sin\\alpha)^2 + (l_{f}\\cos\\alpha)^2 = w^2 + (l_{m} - l_{t})^2$$\n$$l_{f}^2\\sin^2\\alpha + l_{f}^2\\cos^2\\alpha = w^2 + (l_{m} - l_{t})^2$$\nFactoring out $l_{f}^2$:\n$$l_{f}^2(\\sin^2\\alpha + \\cos^2\\alpha) = w^2 + (l_{m} - l_{t})^2$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin^2\\alpha + \\cos^2\\alpha = 1$:\n$$l_{f}^2 = (l_{m} - l_{t})^2 + w^2$$\nSince $l_f$ represents a physical length, it must be non-negative. We take the principal square root of both sides:\n$$l_{f} = \\sqrt{(l_{m} - l_{t})^2 + w^2}$$\nThe expression under the square root is a sum of two squares. Given $w  0$, the quantity $(l_{m} - l_{t})^2 + w^2$ is strictly positive, so $l_f$ is a well-defined positive real number.\n\nTo find $\\alpha$, we can use the definition of the tangent function, $\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{\\cos\\alpha}$. We can obtain this ratio by dividing equation $(2)$ by equation $(3)$:\n$$\\frac{l_{f}\\sin\\alpha}{l_{f}\\cos\\alpha} = \\frac{w}{l_{m} - l_{t}}$$\nAssuming $l_f \\neq 0$ (which we have shown to be true) and $\\cos\\alpha \\neq 0$ (which is true for $0  \\alpha  \\pi/2$), we can simplify:\n$$\\tan\\alpha = \\frac{w}{l_{m} - l_{t}}$$\nTo solve for $\\alpha$, we take the arctangent of both sides:\n$$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{w}{l_{m} - l_{t}}\\right)$$\nWe must verify that this expression for $\\alpha$ is consistent with the given constraint $0  \\alpha  \\pi/2$. The problem states that $w  0$ and $l_m  l_t$, which implies $l_m - l_t  0$. Therefore, the argument of the arctangent function, $\\frac{w}{l_m - l_t}$, is a positive real number. The range of the principal value of the arctangent function for a positive argument is $(0, \\pi/2)$. Thus, the derived expression for $\\alpha$ is fully consistent with the problem's constraints.\n\nThe closed-form expressions for $l_f$ and $\\alpha$ are:\n$$l_{f} = \\sqrt{(l_m - l_t)^2 + w^2}$$\n$$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{w}{l_m - l_t}\\right)$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a single analytic expression reporting both $l_f$ and $\\alpha$ in a row matrix.",

First, we must find the derivative of the normalized force-velocity factor, $\\left.\\dfrac{\\partial f_{v}}{\\partial v}\\right|_{v=0}$. Second, we must analyze the stability of a numerical simulation of a mass-muscle system.\n\n**Part 1: Derivative of the Force-Velocity Factor**\n\nThe classical Hill-type force-velocity relationship is given as:\n$$(F_{\\mathrm{ce}} + a)(v + b) = (F_{0} + a)b$$\nwhere $F_{\\mathrm{ce}}$ is the contractile element force, $v$ is the shortening velocity, $F_{0}$ is the isometric force, and $a$ and $b$ are positive constants.\n\nThe normalized force-velocity factor is defined as $f_{v}(v) := F_{\\mathrm{ce}}/F_{0}$.

First, we find the value of $f_{v}(0)$. By setting $v=0$ in the original equation:\n$$(F_{0} f_{v}(0) + a)(0 + b) = (F_{0} + a)b$$\nSince $b0$, we can divide by $b$:\n$$F_{0} f_{v}(0) + a = F_{0} + a$$\n$$F_{0} f_{v}(0) = F_{0}$$\nWhich gives $f_{v}(0) = 1$, as expected for isometric conditions ($v=0$) at full activation.\n\nNow, we substitute $v=0$ and $f_{v}(0)=1$ into the differentiated equation:\n$$\\left(F_{0} \\left.\\frac{df_{v}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0}\\right)(0 + b) + (F_{0} f_{v}(0) + a) = 0$$\n$$\\left(F_{0} \\left.\\frac{df_{v}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0}\\right) b + (F_{0}(1) + a) = 0$$\n$$F_{0} b \\left.\\frac{df_{v}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0} = -(F_{0} + a)$$\nSolving for the derivative:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial f_{v}}{\\partial v}\\right|_{v=0} = -\\frac{F_{0} + a}{F_{0} b}$$\nThis can be rewritten using the given parameter $a/F_{0}$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial f_{v}}{\\partial v}\\right|_{v=0} = -\\frac{F_{0}(1 + a/F_{0})}{F_{0} b} = -\\frac{1 + a/F_{0}}{b}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values: $a/F_{0} = 0.25$ and $b = 0.15\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial f_{v}}{\\partial v}\\right|_{v=0} = -\\frac{1 + 0.25}{0.15\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = -\\frac{1.25}{0.15}\\ \\mathrm{s/m} = -\\frac{125}{15}\\ \\mathrm{s/m} = -\\frac{25}{3}\\ \\mathrm{s/m} \\approx -8.333\\ldots\\ \\mathrm{s/m}$$\n\n**Part 2: Linearization and Stability Analysis**\n\nThe equation of motion for the mass $m$ is given by Newton's second law:\n$$m\\,\\frac{dv}{dt} = F_{\\mathrm{ce}}(v) - F_{\\mathrm{ext}}$$\nThe system is initially at equilibrium ($v=0$) with an external load $F_{\\mathrm{ext}} = F_{0}$. At this equilibrium, $\\frac{dv}{dt}=0$, so $F_{\\mathrm{ce}}(0) - F_{0} = 0$, which is consistent since $F_{\\mathrm{ce}}(0) = F_{0}$.\n\nWe linearize the equation of motion around the equilibrium point $v=0$. This involves a first-order Taylor expansion of $F_{\\mathrm{ce}}(v)$ around $v=0$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{ce}}(v) \\approx F_{\\mathrm{ce}}(0) + \\left.\\frac{dF_{\\mathrm{ce}}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0} v$$\nSince $F_{\\mathrm{ce}}(v) = F_{0} f_{v}(v)$, the derivative is $\\left.\\frac{dF_{\\mathrm{ce}}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0} = F_{0} \\left.\\frac{df_{v}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0}$.\nSubstituting the expansion into the equation of motion:\n$$m\\,\\frac{dv}{dt} \\approx \\left(F_{\\mathrm{ce}}(0) + \\left.\\frac{dF_{\\mathrm{ce}}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0} v\\right) - F_{0}$$\nSince $F_{\\mathrm{ce}}(0) = F_0$, this simplifies to:\n$$m\\,\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\left(\\left.\\frac{dF_{\\mathrm{ce}}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0}\\right) v$$\nLet's compute the physical slope $\\left.\\frac{dF_{\\mathrm{ce}}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0}$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{dF_{\\mathrm{ce}}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0} = F_{0} \\left.\\frac{df_{v}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0} = (1500\\ \\mathrm{N}) \\left(-\\frac{25}{3}\\ \\mathrm{s/m}\\right) = -12500\\ \\mathrm{N\\,s/m} = -1.25 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{N\\,s/m}$$\nThe linearized ODE is $\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\lambda v$, where $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{m} \\left.\\frac{dF_{\\mathrm{ce}}}{dv}\\right|_{v=0}$.\nWith $m = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{kg}$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{-1.25 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{N\\,s/m}}{1.0\\ \\mathrm{kg}} = -1.25 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nThe solution to this ODE is $v(t) = v(0) e^{\\lambda t}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a validation procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Muscle-tendon unit model: Contractile Element (CE) in series with a Series Elastic Component (SEC).\n- Fiber pennation angle: $\\alpha$\n- Instantaneous fiber length: $l_{f}$\n- Muscle belly length along tendon axis: $L_{m}$\n- Tendon force: $F_{t} = F_{f} \\cos \\alpha$\n- Fiber-axis force: $F_{f} = F_{0} f_{v}(v_{f})$\n- Maximal isometric force: $F_{0}  0$\n- Force-velocity function: $f_{v}(v_{f})$, twice continuously differentiable, $f_{v}(0) = 1$, $f_{v}(v) \\neq 0$ in a neighborhood of the operating velocity.\n- Fiber shortening velocity: $v_{f} = \\dot{l}_{f}$\n- Muscle belly axial velocity: $U = \\dot{L}_{m}$\n- Constant-volume pennation geometry: $l_{f} \\sin \\alpha = w$, where $w  0$ is a constant.\n- Geometric relation: $L_{m} = l_{f} \\cos \\alpha$\n- Fractional tendon force error definition: $\\delta \\equiv \\frac{F_{t}^{\\text{const}} - F_{t}^{\\text{true}}}{F_{t}^{\\text{true}}}$\n- $F_{t}^{\\text{true}}$ uses exact constant-volume kinematics.\n- $F_{t}^{\\text{const}}$ uses constant-pennation kinematics.\n- Task: Derive the leading-order term of $\\delta$ for small $\\alpha$ up to order $\\alpha^2$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a Hill-type muscle model with pennation, a cornerstone of biomechanics. The equations provided, such as the constant-volume constraint ($l_{f} \\sin \\alpha = w$), the geometric projection ($L_{m} = l_{f} \\cos \\alpha$), and the force projection ($F_{t} = F_{f} \\cos \\alpha$), are standard formulations. The task involves a comparison between a rigorous derivation and a common simplification, which is a valid and insightful exercise in theoretical modeling. The problem is firmly rooted in established biomechanical principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It clearly defines all variables and relationships, specifies the quantity to be calculated ($\\delta$), and outlines the method to be used (asymptotic expansion in $\\alpha$). The required inputs for the final expression are explicitly stated. A unique analytical solution is expected.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and mathematical language, free from any subjective or biased content.\n- **Additional Checks**: The problem is self-contained and does not have missing information. The seeming contradiction between the \"constant-volume\" constraint ($l_{f} \\sin \\alpha = w$) and the \"constant-pennation\" assumption is the very subject of the investigation, not a flaw in the problem statement; the problem asks to quantify the error introduced by this simplifying, but physically inconsistent, assumption. The problem is not trivial and requires a rigorous application of calculus and asymptotic analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the kinematic relations for the fiber velocity $v_{f}$ under the two different assumptions, then calculating the corresponding tendon forces, and finally performing an asymptotic expansion of the fractional error $\\delta$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Exact Kinematic Relation (Constant-Volume Geometry)**\n\nThe exact kinematics are derived from the simultaneous satisfaction of two geometric constraints:\n$$\nL_{m} = l_{f} \\cos \\alpha\n$$\n$$\nl_{f} \\sin \\alpha = w\n$$\nDifferentiating the first equation with respect to time $t$ gives the relation between the axial muscle velocity $U = \\dot{L}_{m}$ and the fiber velocity $v_{f} = \\dot{l}_{f}$:\n$$\nU = \\frac{d}{dt}(l_{f} \\cos \\alpha) = \\dot{l}_{f} \\cos \\alpha + l_{f} (-\\sin \\alpha) \\dot{\\alpha} = v_{f} \\cos \\alpha - l_{f} \\sin \\alpha \\dot{\\alpha}\n$$\nTo find $\\dot{\\alpha}$, we differentiate the second equation (the constant-volume constraint) with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(l_{f} \\sin \\alpha) = \\frac{d}{dt}(w) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{l}_{f} \\sin \\alpha + l_{f} \\cos \\alpha \\dot{\\alpha} = 0 \\implies v_{f} \\sin \\alpha + l_{f} \\cos \\alpha \\dot{\\alpha} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\dot{\\alpha}$ yields:\n$$\n\\dot{\\alpha} = -\\frac{v_{f} \\sin \\alpha}{l_{f} \\cos \\alpha}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\dot{\\alpha}$ into the equation for $U$:\n$$\nU = v_{f} \\cos \\alpha - l_{f} \\sin \\alpha \\left(-\\frac{v_{f} \\sin \\alpha}{l_{f} \\cos \\alpha}\\right) = v_{f} \\cos \\alpha + v_{f} \\frac{\\sin^{2} \\alpha}{\\cos \\alpha}\n$$\n$$\nU = v_{f} \\left(\\frac{\\cos^{2} \\alpha + \\sin^{2} \\alpha}{\\cos \\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{v_{f}}{\\cos \\alpha}\n$$\nThis gives the fiber velocity for the true model, which we denote as $v_{f}^{\\text{true}}$:\n$$\nv_{f}^{\\text{true}} = U \\cos \\alpha\n$$\nAs a check, in the limit of parallel fibers where $\\alpha \\to 0$, we have $\\cos \\alpha \\to 1$, and thus $v_{f}^{\\text{true}} \\to U$. This is the correct limit, as for parallel fibers $L_{m} = l_{f}$, so their velocities must be equal.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Simplified Kinematic Relation (Constant-Pennation Assumption)**\n\nThe simplified model assumes that the pennation angle $\\alpha$ is constant when considering the kinematics. This implies that $\\dot{\\alpha} = 0$. Starting from the general differentiated relation for $U$:\n$$\nU = v_{f} \\cos \\alpha - l_{f} \\sin \\alpha \\dot{\\alpha}\n$$\nApplying the assumption $\\dot{\\alpha} = 0$, we get:\n$$\nU = v_{f} \\cos \\alpha\n$$\nThis gives the fiber velocity under the constant-pennation assumption, which we denote as $v_{f}^{\\text{const}}$:\n$$\nv_{f}^{\\text{const}} = \\frac{U}{\\cos \\alpha}\n$$\n\n**3. Formulation and Asymptotic Expansion of the Fractional Force Error $\\delta$**\n\nThe tendon force $F_{t}$ is given by $F_{t} = F_{f} \\cos \\alpha = F_{0} f_{v}(v_{f}) \\cos \\alpha$. The fractional error $\\delta$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{F_{t}^{\\text{const}} - F_{t}^{\\text{true}}}{F_{t}^{\\text{true}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces:\n$$\nF_{t}^{\\text{true}} = F_{0} f_{v}(v_{f}^{\\text{true}}) \\cos \\alpha = F_{0} f_{v}(U \\cos \\alpha) \\cos \\alpha\n$$\n$$\nF_{t}^{\\text{const}} = F_{0} f_{v}(v_{f}^{\\text{const}}) \\cos \\alpha = F_{0} f_{v}\\left(\\frac{U}{\\cos \\alpha}\\right) \\cos \\alpha\n$$\nThe expression for $\\delta$ becomes:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{F_{0} f_{v}\\left(\\frac{U}{\\cos \\alpha}\\right) \\cos \\alpha - F_{0} f_{v}(U \\cos \\alpha) \\cos \\alpha}{F_{0} f_{v}(U \\cos \\alpha) \\cos \\alpha} = \\frac{f_{v}\\left(\\frac{U}{\\cos \\alpha}\\right) - f_{v}(U \\cos \\alpha)}{f_{v}(U \\cos \\alpha)}\n$$\nWe seek the leading-order term of $\\delta$ for small $\\alpha$. We use Taylor series expansions around $\\alpha=0$.\n$$\n\\cos \\alpha = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha^{2}}{2} + O(\\alpha^{4})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\cos \\alpha} = \\sec \\alpha = 1 + \\frac{\\alpha^{2}}{2} + O(\\alpha^{4})\n$$\nThe arguments of the function $f_{v}$ are thus:\n$$\nv_{f}^{\\text{true}} = U \\cos \\alpha = U\\left(1 - \\frac{\\alpha^{2}}{2}\\right) + O(\\alpha^{4}) = U - \\frac{U\\alpha^{2}}{2} + O(\\alpha^{4})\n$$\n$$\nv_{f}^{\\text{const}} = \\frac{U}{\\cos \\alpha} = U\\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha^{2}}{2}\\right) + O(\\alpha^{4}) = U + \\frac{U\\alpha^{2}}{2} + O(\\alpha^{4})\n$$\nBoth velocities are perturbations of magnitude $O(\\alpha^{2})$ around the axial velocity $U$. We can Taylor-expand the function $f_{v}$ around $v=U$. Let $v = U+h$. Since $f_{v}$ is twice continuously differentiable, its expansion is:\n$$\nf_{v}(U+h) = f_{v}(U) + f_{v}'(U)h + O(h^{2})\n$$\nwhere $f_{v}'(U)$ denotes the derivative $\\frac{df_{v}}{dv}$ evaluated at $v=U$.\n\nLet's expand the terms in the numerator of $\\delta$:\n$$\nf_{v}(v_{f}^{\\text{const}}) = f_{v}\\left(U + \\frac{U\\alpha^{2}}{2} + O(\\alpha^{4})\\right) = f_{v}(U) + f_{v}'(U)\\left(\\frac{U\\alpha^{2}}{2}\\right) + O(\\alpha^{4})\n$$\n$$\nf_{v}(v_{f}^{\\text{true}}) = f_{v}\\left(U - \\frac{U\\alpha^{2}}{2} + O(\\alpha^{4})\\right) = f_{v}(U) + f_{v}'(U)\\left(-\\frac{U\\alpha^{2}}{2}\\right) + O(\\alpha^{4})\n$$\nThe numerator is then:\n\\begin{align*}\nf_{v}(v_{f}^{\\text{const}}) - f_{v}(v_{f}^{\\text{true}}) = \\left( f_{v}(U) + \\frac{U\\alpha^{2}}{2}f_{v}'(U) \\right) - \\left( f_{v}(U) - \\frac{U\\alpha^{2}}{2}f_{v}'(U) \\right) + O(\\alpha^{4}) \\\\\n= U\\alpha^{2}f_{v}'(U) + O(\\alpha^{4})\n\\end{align*}\nThe leading-order term in the numerator is of order $\\alpha^{2}$.\n\nNow, for the denominator of $\\delta$:\n$$\nf_{v}(v_{f}^{\\text{true}}) = f_{v}(U \\cos \\alpha)\n$$\nAs $\\alpha \\to 0$, $U\\cos\\alpha \\to U$. The leading-order term of the denominator is simply $f_{v}(U)$. We note that the problem states $f_{v}(v) \\neq 0$ near the operating velocity, so $f_{v}(U) \\neq 0$.\nMore formally, the denominator is $f_{v}(U) - \\frac{U\\alpha^{2}}{2}f_{v}'(U) + O(\\alpha^{4})$.\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator to find the leading-order term of $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{U\\alpha^{2}f_{v}'(U) + O(\\alpha^{4})}{f_{v}(U) + O(\\alpha^{2})}\n$$\nThe leading-order term as $\\alpha \\to 0$ is the ratio of the leading-order terms of the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n\\delta \\approx \\frac{U\\alpha^{2}f_{v}'(U)}{f_{v}(U)}\n$$\nThis expression provides the leading-order fractional error in tendon force caused by using the simplified constant-pennation kinematic assumption instead of the full constant-volume geometry.",
