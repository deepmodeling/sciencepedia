            "problem": "A single sarcomere can be idealized along its long axis as two symmetric half-sarcomeres with an M-line at the center and Z-lines at the ends. Consider a single thick filament whose head-bearing portion has total axial length $L_{m}$ (so that each half filament from the M-line to its distal end has head-bearing length $L_{m}/2$), and a thin filament that extends from each Z-line toward the M-line over an axial length $L_{a}$. The sarcomere length is $L_{s}$, so each half-sarcomere has length $L_{s}/2$ from the M-line to a Z-line. During Excitation-Contraction coupling (E-C coupling), assume a saturating intracellular calcium ion concentration such that tropomyosin is fully displaced by troponin, exposing all actin binding sites along the thin filament wherever it overlaps axially with a myosin head-bearing region. Assume the following:\n\n- All structural quantities $L_{s}$, $L_{m}$, $L_{a}$, and $d$ are positive real numbers, and the thin filament does not cross the M-line (that is, there is no actin beyond the M-line in either half-sarcomere).\n- Myosin heads on each half of the thick filament are arranged in a one-dimensional axial lattice with uniform spacing $d$, at axial positions $x = k \\cdot d$ for integers $k \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots\\}$ measured from the M-line in each half-sarcomere, with the constraint $k \\cdot d \\leq L_{m}/2$. Treat each axial lattice position as one potential myosin head location on that half of the thick filament.\n- Ignore any radial lattice effects (for example, the hexagonal filament lattice) and any steric restrictions other than axial overlap; count only those myosin head positions that lie axially within a region where an actin filament is present.\n\nUsing only core geometric reasoning about axial overlap and the uniform discrete axial distribution of myosin heads, derive a closed-form expression for the total number of potential myosin heads on this single thick filament that can interact with actin when the sarcomere length is $L_{s}$. Your expression must depend only on $L_{s}$, $L_{m}$, $L_{a}$, and $d$, and should be given as a single analytic expression. No numerical evaluation is required.

The model is based on established biological structures and principles. It is scientifically sound as an educational model.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. All variables and geometric constraints are clearly defined. The objective is to derive a mathematical expression based on these givens. The information is sufficient and self-contained to determine a unique analytical solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language. Terms like \"idealized,\" \"axial length,\" and \"uniform spacing\" are clearly defined within the context of the model. There is no subjective or opinion-based content.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, or unrealistic within the context of an idealized model. It is well-structured and requires substantive reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\nThe total number of interacting myosin heads, $N$, can be found by determining the number of heads in one half-sarcomere, $N_{\\text{half}}$, and multiplying by $2$ due to the specified symmetry of the sarcomere.\n$$N = 2 \\cdot N_{\\text{half}}$$\nLet us establish a coordinate system for a single half-sarcomere, with the M-line at position $x=0$ and the Z-line at $x = L_{s}/2$.\n\nThe thin (actin) filament extends from the Z-line (at $x=L_{s}/2$) towards the M-line over an axial length $L_{a}$. Therefore, the actin filament occupies the closed interval $I_{a}$:\n$$I_{a} = \\left[ \\frac{L_{s}}{2} - L_{a}, \\frac{L_{s}}{2} \\right]$$\nThe problem states that the thin filament does not cross the M-line, which implies that the starting coordinate of the actin filament must be non-negative:\n$$\\frac{L_{s}}{2} - L_{a} \\ge 0 \\implies L_{s} \\ge 2L_{a}$$\n\nThe myosin heads are located at discrete axial positions $x_k = k \\cdot d$, for positive integers $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. These heads exist within the head-bearing portion of the thick filament, which extends from the M-line to $x = L_{m}/2$. Thus, the position of any myosin head must satisfy $x_k \\le L_{m}/2$.\n\nA myosin head can interact with actin if its position $x_k$ lies within the region of axial overlap. This means the head's position must be a valid head position AND fall within the interval $I_{a}$ occupied by actin. The conditions for an integer $k$ to correspond to an interacting head are:\n1.  The head must be a valid head, starting from $k=1$: $k \\ge 1$.\n2.  The head must be within the head-bearing region: $k \\cdot d \\le L_{m}/2$.\n3.  The head must overlap with the actin filament: $\\frac{L_{s}}{2} - L_{a} \\le k \\cdot d \\le \\frac{L_{s}}{2}$.\n\nCombining these inequalities, we need to count the number of integers $k$ that satisfy:\n$$ \\max\\left(1, \\frac{\\frac{L_{s}}{2} - L_{a}}{d}\\right) \\le k \\le \\min\\left(\\frac{L_{m}/2}{d}, \\frac{L_{s}/2}{d}\\right) $$\nLet's analyze the lower and upper bounds for $k$.\n\nThe upper bound for $k$, let's call it $k_{\\text{upper}}$, is:\n$$k \\le \\min\\left(\\frac{L_{m}}{2d}, \\frac{L_{s}}{2d}\\right) = \\frac{\\min(L_{m}, L_{s})}{2d}$$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the maximum possible value for $k$, denoted $k_{\\max}$, is the floor of this expression:\n$$k_{\\max} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(L_{s}, L_{m})}{2d} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nThe lower bound for $k$, let's call it $k_{\\text{lower}}$, is:\n$$k \\ge \\max\\left(1, \\frac{L_{s} - 2L_{a}}{2d}\\right)$$\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the minimum possible value for $k$, denoted $k_{\\min}$, is the ceiling of this expression. The ceiling of a maximum of numbers is the maximum of their ceilings: $\\lceil \\max(A,B) \\rceil = \\max(\\lceil A \\rceil, \\lceil B \\rceil)$.\n$$k_{\\min} = \\left\\lceil \\max\\left(1, \\frac{L_{s} - 2L_{a}}{2d}\\right) \\right\\rceil = \\max\\left(\\lceil 1 \\rceil, \\left\\lceil \\frac{L_{s} - 2L_{a}}{2d} \\right\\rceil\\right) = \\max\\left(1, \\left\\lceil \\frac{L_{s} - 2L_{a}}{2d} \\right\\rceil\\right)$$\n\nThe number of interacting heads in one half-sarcomere, $N_{\\text{half}}$, is the number of integers in the interval $[k_{\\min}, k_{\\max}]$. The number of integers in a closed interval $[a, b]$ is given by $b - a + 1$. This count is valid only if $b \\ge a$; otherwise, the count is $0$. A robust way to express this is $\\max(0, b - a + 1)$.\nTherefore,\n$$N_{\\text{half}} = \\max\\left(0, k_{\\max} - k_{\\min} + 1\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $k_{\\max}$ and $k_{\\min}$:\n$$N_{\\text{half}} = \\max\\left(0, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(L_{s}, L_{m})}{2d} \\right\\rfloor - \\max\\left(1, \\left\\lceil \\frac{L_{s} - 2L_{a}}{2d} \\right\\rceil\\right) + 1\\right)$$\n\nThe total number of interacting heads, $N$, for the entire sarcomere is twice this value:\n$$N = 2 \\cdot N_{\\text{half}} = 2 \\cdot \\max\\left(0, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\min(L_{s}, L_{m})}{2d} \\right\\rfloor - \\max\\left(1, \\left\\lceil \\frac{L_{s} - 2L_{a}}{2d} \\right\\rceil\\right) + 1\\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression depending only on the given parameters. The use of floor, ceiling, min, and max functions is necessary to capture the discrete nature of the head positions and the geometric boundaries of the overlap region in a single formula.",

Since $N$ and $F_{\\mathrm{cb}}$ are positive constants, the peak force $F_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ occurs when the attachment probability $p(t)$ reaches its maximum.\n\nTo find the time of peak force, we examine the derivative of $p(t)$:\n- For $0 < t \\le T$, $\\frac{dp}{dt} = f - (f+g)p(t)$. Since $p(t)$ begins at $0$ and increases towards $\\frac{f}{f+g}$, the derivative $\\frac{dp}{dt}$ is always positive in this interval. Therefore, $p(t)$ is strictly increasing on $(0, T]$.\n- For $t > T$, $\\frac{dp}{dt} = -gp(t)$. Since $g > 0$ and $p(t) \\ge 0$, the derivative $\\frac{dp}{dt}$ is always non-positive. Therefore, $p(t)$ is monotonically decreasing for $t > T$.\n\nThe function $p(t)$ increases until $t=T$ and then decreases. The maximum value of $p(t)$ must therefore occur at $t=T$. The peak force arises at the exact instant the calcium transient ends.\n\nThe peak attachment probability is $p(T)$.\n$$\np_{\\mathrm{peak}} = p(T) = \\frac{f}{f+g} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(f+g)T\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe peak force is then:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{peak}} = N \\cdot F_{\\mathrm{cb}} \\cdot p(T) = N F_{\\mathrm{cb}} \\frac{f}{f+g} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(f+g)T\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$f = 120\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$g = 40\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$T = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$N = 3.0 \\times 10^{6}$\n$F_{\\mathrm{cb}} = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{pN} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless terms in the expression for $p(T)$:\n$$\nf+g = 120\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 40\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 160\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{f}{f+g} = \\frac{120\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{160\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n$$\nThe argument of the exponential is:\n$$\n(f+g)T = (160\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 0.8\n$$\nNow, substitute these into the expression for $p(T)$:\n$$\np(T) = 0.75 \\left(1 - \\exp(-0.8)\\right) \\approx 0.75 \\left(1 - 0.449329\\right) \\approx 0.75(0.550671) \\approx 0.413003\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the peak force:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{peak}} = (3.0 \\times 10^{6}) \\cdot (3.5 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{N}) \\cdot (0.413003)\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{peak}} = (10.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N}) \\cdot (0.413003)\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 4.33653\\,\\mu\\mathrm{N}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $4.34\\,\\mu\\mathrm{N}$.",
