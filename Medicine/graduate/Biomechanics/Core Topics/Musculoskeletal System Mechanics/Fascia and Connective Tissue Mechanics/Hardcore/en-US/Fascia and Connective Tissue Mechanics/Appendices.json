The tangent modulus is defined as the first derivative of the stress with respect to the stretch.\n\nThe given constitutive relation is:\n$$\n\\sigma(\\lambda) = A\\left(\\exp(B(\\lambda-1)) - 1\\right)\n$$\nThe tangent modulus, $E_{t}(\\lambda)$, is defined as:\n$$\nE_{t}(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}\n$$\nWe proceed by differentiating the expression for $\\sigma(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$\nE_{t}(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} \\left[ A\\left(\\exp(B(\\lambda-1)) - 1\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $A$ is a constant, we can use the constant multiple rule for differentiation:\n$$\nE_{t}(\\lambda) = A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} \\left[ \\exp(B(\\lambda-1)) - 1 \\right]\n$$\nUsing the difference rule, we differentiate the terms inside the brackets separately:\n$$\nE_{t}(\\lambda) = A \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}\\left[\\exp(B(\\lambda-1))\\right] - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}[1] \\right)\n$$\nThe derivative of the constant $1$ is $0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nE_{t}(\\lambda) = A \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}\\left[\\exp(B(\\lambda-1))\\right]\n$$\nTo find the derivative of the exponential term, we apply the chain rule. Let $u(\\lambda) = B(\\lambda-1)$. Then, the derivative of $u$ with respect to $\\lambda$ is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} = B$. The derivative of $\\exp(u)$ is $\\exp(u)\\frac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}$.

Since we are considering the case where $I_{4} < I_{4,0}$, the argument of the Heaviside function, $I_{4}-I_{4,0}$, is negative. Therefore, $H(I_{4}-I_{4,0}) = 0$.\n\nThis simplifies the fiber contribution to $W_{\\mathrm{f}}(I_{4}) = 0$. The total strain-energy density function reduces to only its isotropic part:\n$$\nW(\\mathbf{C}) = W_{\\mathrm{m}}(I_{1}) = \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\,(I_{1}-3)\n$$\nThis is the strain-energy function for a purely Neo-Hookean material.\n\nFor an incompressible hyperelastic material, the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mathbf{F}\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\mathbf{C}}\\mathbf{F}^{\\top}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the incompressibility constraint $J=1$, and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\n\nWe need to compute the derivative of $W$ with respect to $\\mathbf{C}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\mathbf{C}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{C}}\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\,(I_{1}-3)\\right) = \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\frac{\\partial I_{1}}{\\partial \\mathbf{C}}\n$$\nGiven that $I_{1} = \\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{C})$, its derivative with respect to $\\mathbf{C}$ is the identity tensor $\\mathbf{I}$. Thus,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial \\mathbf{C}} = \\frac{\\mu}{2}\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the Cauchy stress:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\mathbf{I} + 2\\mathbf{F}\\left(\\frac{\\mu}{2}\\mathbf{I}\\right)\\mathbf{F}^{\\top} = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\mu\\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{F}^{\\top}\n$$\nThe tensor $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{F}^{\\top}$ is the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor.\n\nThe problem specifies the deformation gradient for uniaxial extension as $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathrm{diag}\\!\\left(\\lambda,\\lambda^{-1/2},\\lambda^{-1/2}\\right)$. We can compute $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{F}^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1/2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda^{-1/2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1/2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda^{-1/2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the equation for $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\mu \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWriting out the components of the stress tensor:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = -p + \\mu\\lambda^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{22} = -p + \\mu\\lambda^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{33} = -p + \\mu\\lambda^{-1}\n$$\nThe off-diagonal components are all zero.\n\nThe problem states that the lateral faces are traction-free. The extension is along the first principal axis ($\\mathbf{e}_1$), so the lateral directions are along $\\mathbf{e}_2$ and $\\mathbf{e}_3$. The traction-free condition implies that the normal components of stress in these directions are zero: $\\sigma_{22}=0$ and $\\sigma_{33}=0$.\n\nUsing $\\sigma_{22}=0$:\n$$\n-p + \\mu\\lambda^{-1} = 0\n$$\nThis allows us to determine the Lagrange multiplier $p$:\n$$\np = \\mu\\lambda^{-1}\n$$\nThe condition $\\sigma_{33}=0$ gives the same result.\n\nFinally, we can find the axial Cauchy stress, $\\sigma_{11}$, by substituting the expression for $p$ back into the equation for $\\sigma_{11}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = -(\\mu\\lambda^{-1}) + \\mu\\lambda^2 = \\mu\\lambda^2 - \\mu\\lambda^{-1}\n$$\nFactoring out the shear modulus $\\mu$, we obtain the final expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = \\mu\\left(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-1}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for $I_4 < I_{4,0}$, or equivalently, $\\lambda^2 < I_{4,0}$. This result is the classic expression for the tensile stress in an incompressible Neo-Hookean material under uniaxial extension.",
