            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of rotational mechanics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the expression for instantaneous mechanical power in a rotational system starting from the fundamental definitions of work and power in a translational context.\n\nFirst, we begin with the definition of the differential mechanical work, $\\mathrm{d}W$, done by a force, $\\vec{F}$, over an infinitesimal displacement, $\\mathrm{d}\\vec{s}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}W = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\vec{s}\n$$\nInstantaneous power, $P$, is defined as the time rate of doing work:\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathrm{d}W$ into the definition of $P$, we get:\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\vec{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\vec{s}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{s}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nRecognizing that the time derivative of displacement is the instantaneous velocity, $\\vec{v} = \\mathrm{d}\\vec{s}/\\mathrm{d}t$, the expression for power in terms of linear motion variables is:\n$$\nP = \\vec{F} \\cdot \\vec{v}\n$$\nThe next step is to reformulate this expression for a system undergoing pure rotation about a fixed axis, as described for the knee joint. Let $\\vec{r}$ be the position vector from a point on the axis of rotation to the point of application of the force $\\vec{F}$. For a pure rotation through an infinitesimal angle $\\mathrm{d}\\vec{\\theta}$, the corresponding infinitesimal linear displacement $\\mathrm{d}\\vec{s}$ is given by the cross product:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}\\vec{s} = \\mathrm{d}\\vec{\\theta} \\times \\vec{r}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for differential work:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}W = \\vec{F} \\cdot (\\mathrm{d}\\vec{\\theta} \\times \\vec{r})\n$$\nWe can apply the scalar triple product identity $\\vec{A} \\cdot (\\vec{B} \\times \\vec{C}) = (\\vec{A} \\times \\vec{B}) \\cdot \\vec{C}$. However, a more useful permutation for this context is $\\vec{A} \\cdot (\\vec{B} \\times \\vec{C}) = \\vec{B} \\cdot (\\vec{C} \\times \\vec{A})$. Let $\\vec{A} = \\vec{F}$, $\\vec{B} = \\mathrm{d}\\vec{\\theta}$, and $\\vec{C} = \\vec{r}$. Applying this identity yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}W = \\mathrm{d}\\vec{\\theta} \\cdot (\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F})\n$$\nThe term $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$ is the definition of the moment (or torque), $\\vec{M}$, generated by the force $\\vec{F}$ about the axis of rotation.\n$$\n\\vec{M} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}\n$$\nTherefore, the differential work done during a rotation is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}W = \\vec{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\vec{\\theta}\n$$\nNow, we can find the instantaneous rotational power by taking the time derivative:\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}W}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} (\\vec{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{d}\\vec{\\theta})\n$$\nSince the moment $\\vec{M}$ is constant in this problem, we can write:\n$$\nP = \\vec{M} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{\\theta}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nThe time rate of change of angular displacement is the angular velocity, $\\vec{\\omega} = \\mathrm{d}\\vec{\\theta}/\\mathrm{d}t$. This gives the final derived expression for instantaneous mechanical power in a rotational system:\n$$\nP = \\vec{M} \\cdot \\vec{\\omega}\n$$\nFor the specific case of rotation about a single fixed axis, the vectors $\\vec{M}$ and $\\vec{\\omega}$ are collinear. Their dot product simplifies to the algebraic product of their scalar magnitudes, $M$ and $\\omega$:\n$$\nP = M \\omega\n$$\nThe problem specifies a sign convention where knee extension is positive. We are given:\n- A net extensor moment, which according to the convention is positive: $M = +50\\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$.\n- A knee extension angular velocity, which according to the convention is also positive: $\\omega = +2\\ \\text{rad/s}$.\n\nWe can now evaluate the power:\n$$\nP = (50\\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}) \\times (2\\ \\text{rad/s}) = 100\\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m/s}\n$$\nThe unit $\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m/s}$ is equivalent to Joules per second ($\\text{J/s}$), which is defined as the Watt ($\\text{W}$).\n$$\nP = 100\\ \\text{W}\n$$\nThe sign of the power is significant, indicating the direction of energy transfer.\n- **Concentric action**: This occurs when the muscle group creating the moment causes a rotation in the same direction as the moment it generates. The muscle effectively \"wins\" against the load and shortens. In this case, the signs of $M$ and $\\omega$ are the same ($M>0$ and $\\omega>0$, or $M<0$ and $\\omega<0$). The resulting power, $P = M \\omega$, is positive ($P>0$). Positive power signifies that the musculoskeletal system is performing work on the environment (i.e., generating mechanical energy). The given problem, with an extensor moment ($M>0$) and an extension velocity ($\\omega>0$), describes a concentric contraction of the knee extensor muscles.\n\n- **Eccentric action**: This occurs when the muscle group creating the moment acts to oppose a rotation caused by an external load. The muscle effectively \"loses\" against the load and lengthens while under tension, acting as a brake. In this case, the signs of $M$ and $\\omega$ are opposite ($M>0$ and $\\omega<0$, or $M<0$ and $\\omega>0$). The resulting power, $P = M \\omega$, is negative ($P<0$). Negative power signifies that the environment is performing work on the musculoskeletal system, which absorbs this mechanical energy. An example would be the knee extensors producing an extensor moment ($M>0$) to control the rate of knee flexion ($\\omega<0$) while lowering a heavy object.\n\nThe scenario described in the problem is a concentric knee extension, for which the calculated power must be positive, consistent with our result of $100\\ \\text{W}$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of collision work per unit mass, and then for the calculation of the push-off work per unit mass required to maintain a steady walking speed under a specific biomechanical model.\n\nFirst, let's validate the problem.\nGivens:\n1.  Model: Walker's Center of Mass (COM) is a point mass, legs are massless.\n2.  Gait phase: Single support motion is on a circular arc about the stance foot.\n3.  Transition: Heel-strike transitions are instantaneous.\n4.  Geometry: Just before transition, the old stance leg is at angle $-\\theta$ from vertical.

Objective: Derive collision work per unit mass; compute the positive push-off work per unit mass needed to compensate for this loss.\n\nValidation:\nThe problem describes the \"inverted pendulum\" model of walking, a standard and scientifically grounded simplification in biomechanics. The concepts of impulsive collisions, work, and kinetic energy are from fundamental Newtonian mechanics. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters given are physically realistic for human locomotion. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Collision Work per Unit Mass\n\nLet $m$ be the mass of the walker's COM. Let $\\vec{v}^{-}$ be the velocity of the COM just before the heel-strike collision, and $\\vec{v}^{+}$ be the velocity just after the collision. The problem states that the speed just before the collision is $v$, so $|\\vec{v}^{-}| = v$.\n\nThe direction of $\\vec{v}^{-}$ is tangential to the circular arc defined by the trailing leg, which is at an angle $-\\theta$ to the vertical. The direction of $\\vec{v}^{+}$ is tangential to the arc of the new leading leg, which is at an angle $+\\theta$ to the vertical. The problem states that the angle between the vectors $\\vec{v}^{-}$ and $\\vec{v}^{+}$ is $2\\theta$.\n\nLet $\\hat{u}^{-}$ and $\\hat{u}^{+}$ be the unit vectors in the direction of $\\vec{v}^{-}$ and $\\vec{v}^{+}$, respectively. We have $\\vec{v}^{-} = v \\hat{u}^{-}$. The angle between $\\hat{u}^{-}$ and $\\hat{u}^{+}$ is $2\\theta$.\n\nThe problem states that the impulsive ground reaction force \"removes the component of COM velocity orthogonal to the new tangential direction.\" This is a key statement defining the collision. It means that the post-collision velocity $\\vec{v}^{+}$ is the vector projection of the pre-collision velocity $\\vec{v}^{-}$ onto the new direction of motion $\\hat{u}^{+}$.\n\nThe projection is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{v}^{+} = (\\vec{v}^{-} \\cdot \\hat{u}^{+}) \\hat{u}^{+}\n$$\nTo find the speed after the collision, $v^{+} = |\\vec{v}^{+}|$, we take the magnitude of this expression:\n$$\nv^{+} = |(\\vec{v}^{-} \\cdot \\hat{u}^{+}) \\hat{u}^{+}| = |\\vec{v}^{-} \\cdot \\hat{u}^{+}| |\\hat{u}^{+}|\n$$\nSince $\\hat{u}^{+}$ is a unit vector, $|\\hat{u}^{+}|=1$. Substituting $\\vec{v}^{-} = v \\hat{u}^{-}$:\n$$\nv^{+} = |v \\hat{u}^{-} \\cdot \\hat{u}^{+}| = v |\\hat{u}^{-} \\cdot \\hat{u}^{+}|\n$$\nThe dot product of two unit vectors is the cosine of the angle between them. The angle is $2\\theta$.\n$$\nv^{+} = v |\\cos(2\\theta)|\n$$\nFor typical walking, the half-angle of the legs $\\theta$ is acute, such that $2\\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which means $\\cos(2\\theta)$ is positive. Thus, we can remove the absolute value:\n$$\nv^{+} = v \\cos(2\\theta)\n$$\nThe work done on the COM by the impulsive collision force, $W_{coll}$, is equal to the change in the COM's kinetic energy, according to the work-energy theorem.\n$$\nW_{coll} = \\Delta K = K_{final} - K_{initial} = \\frac{1}{2}m(v^{+})^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m(v^{-})^2\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the speeds:\n$$\nW_{coll} = \\frac{1}{2}m(v \\cos(2\\theta))^2 - \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 \\cos^2(2\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2}m v^2\n$$\nFactoring out $\\frac{1}{2}m v^2$:\n$$\nW_{coll} = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 (\\cos^2(2\\theta) - 1)\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(x) + \\cos^2(x) = 1$, which implies $\\cos^2(x) - 1 = -\\sin^2(x)$:\n$$\nW_{coll} = -\\frac{1}{2}m v^2 \\sin^2(2\\theta)\n$$\nThe collision work per unit mass is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{W_{coll}}{m} = -\\frac{1}{2} v^2 \\sin^2(2\\theta)\n$$\nThis work is negative, indicating a loss of mechanical energy from the system due to the inelastic collision with the ground.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Push-off Work per Unit Mass\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum positive push-off work per unit mass, $W_{po}/m$, required to maintain a steady walking speed. \"Steady speed\" implies that the state of the walker is periodic. Specifically, the speed just before each collision, $v$, must be the same from step to step.\n\nIn each step, an amount of energy equal to $|W_{coll}|$ is lost due to the collision. To maintain a steady state, this energy must be replenished. The problem attributes this energy input to the \"push-off work... performed by the trailing leg just prior to heel-strike.\"\n\nFor the net energy change over one full step cycle to be zero, the work done by the push-off, $W_{po}$, must exactly counteract the work done by the collision, $W_{coll}$.\n$$\nW_{po} + W_{coll} = 0\n$$\n$$\nW_{po} = -W_{coll}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $W_{coll}$:\n$$\nW_{po} = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}m v^2 \\sin^2(2\\theta)\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}m v^2 \\sin^2(2\\theta)\n$$\nThe push-off work per unit mass is:\n$$\n\\frac{W_{po}}{m} = \\frac{1}{2} v^2 \\sin^2(2\\theta)\n$$\nWe are asked to compute this value for $v=1.4\\ \\text{m/s}$ and $\\theta=0.15\\ \\text{rad}$.\nThe angle for the sine function is $2\\theta = 2 \\times 0.15\\ \\text{rad} = 0.3\\ \\text{rad}$.\n$$\n\\frac{W_{po}}{m} = \\frac{1}{2} (1.4\\ \\text{m/s})^2 \\sin^2(0.3\\ \\text{rad})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{W_{po}}{m} = \\frac{1}{2} (1.96\\ \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}^2) \\sin^2(0.3)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{W_{po}}{m} = 0.98 \\times (\\sin(0.3))^2\\ \\text{J/kg}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$\\sin(0.3) \\approx 0.2955202$\n$(\\sin(0.3))^2 \\approx 0.08733218$\n$$ \\frac{W_{po}}{m} \\approx 0.98 \\times 0.08733218 \\approx 0.08558554\\ \\text{J/kg} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\n\\frac{W_{po}}{m} \\approx 0.08559\\ \\text{J/kg}\n$$\nThis single numerical value corresponds to the minimum positive push-off work per unit mass needed to maintain a steady speed.",

The rate of internal work, $\\dot{W}_{\\mathrm{int}}(t)$, is the time derivative of $E_{k, \\mathrm{rel}}(t)$:\n$$ \\dot{W}_{\\mathrm{int}}(t) = \\frac{dE_{k, \\mathrm{rel}}}{dt} = C \\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin^2(\\omega t)) = C \\cdot 2\\sin(\\omega t)\\cos(\\omega t) \\cdot \\omega = C\\omega\\sin(2\\omega t) $$\nThe total positive internal work over one cycle is the integral of the positive portion of this power curve:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\max(0, \\dot{W}_{\\mathrm{int}}(t)) dt $$\nThis power is positive when $\\sin(2\\omega t) > 0$, which for $t \\in [0, \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}]$ occurs in the intervals $t \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}]$ and $t \\in [\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2\\omega}]$.\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\int_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}} C\\omega\\sin(2\\omega t) dt + \\int_{\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}}^{\\frac{3\\pi}{2\\omega}} C\\omega\\sin(2\\omega t) dt $$\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\left[ -\\frac{C}{2}\\cos(2\\omega t) \\right]_{0}^{\\frac{\\pi}{2\\omega}} + \\left[ -\\frac{C}{2}\\cos(2\\omega t) \\right]_{\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}}^{\\frac{3\\pi}{2\\omega}} $$\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\left( -\\frac{C}{2}(\\cos(\\pi) - \\cos(0)) \\right) + \\left( -\\frac{C}{2}(\\cos(3\\pi) - \\cos(2\\pi)) \\right) $$\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\left( -\\frac{C}{2}(-1-1) \\right) + \\left( -\\frac{C}{2}(-1-1) \\right) = C + C = 2C $$\nSubstituting the definition of $C$:\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{int}} = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{s} m_s U_s^2 \\right) = \\sum_{s} m_s U_s^2 $$\nThe sum $\\sum_s$ is over all segments. Since left and right limbs are identical, we can calculate the sum for the listed segments (one leg and one arm) and multiply by $2$.\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{int}} = 2 \\sum_{s'} m_{s'} U_{s'}^2 $$\nwhere $s'$ denotes the segments in the provided list.\n\n**Internal Work for Natural Arm Swing (Trial 1):**\n$m = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.

As long as the trajectory of the COM is unchanged, $W_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ must remain constant, regardless of the internal limb motions used to achieve that COM trajectory. Internal work ($W_{\\mathrm{int}}$) is determined by the energy fluctuations of the segments *relative* to the COM. The body can use different coordination strategies (e.g., with or without arm swing) to produce the same COM motion. Constraining the arms eliminates their contribution to relative motion but forces a compensatory adjustment in the motion of other segments (the legs). This change in segmental kinematics alters the total kinetic energy relative to the COM, thereby changing the internal work required, even while external work remains fixed.\n\n**Increase in Internal Work (Trial 2 vs. Trial 1)**\nFirst, we calculate the internal work for the arms-constrained trial, $W_{\\mathrm{int},2}$.
