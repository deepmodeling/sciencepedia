            "introduction": "Understanding how biological tissues deform over time begins with analyzing the local motion of their constituent material points. This exercise provides a foundational look into the kinematics of motion by starting with a prescribed velocity field. By calculating the velocity gradient and decomposing it into its symmetric (rate-of-deformation) and skew-symmetric (spin) parts, you will see how a complex motion can be locally separated into pure stretching and pure rotation, a cornerstone of continuum mechanics . This practice also connects these kinematic measures to the physical concept of incompressibility, a critical assumption in modeling many biological materials.",

            "problem": "Consider a homogeneous biological tissue treated as a continuum and observed in a Cartesian frame with orthonormal basis. The instantaneous velocity field is prescribed as $\\boldsymbol{v}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = (a x, b y, c z)$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are spatially uniform constants (with units of $\\text{s}^{-1}$) and $(x,y,z)$ are the Cartesian coordinates of the material point $\\boldsymbol{x}$.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe instantaneous velocity field $\\boldsymbol{v}$ of the material points is given in a Cartesian coordinate system $\\boldsymbol{x} = (x, y, z)$ as $\\boldsymbol{v}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = (v_x, v_y, v_z) = (a x, b y, c z)$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are spatially uniform constants.\n\nFirst, we compute the velocity gradient tensor, $\\boldsymbol{L}$. By definition, $\\boldsymbol{L} = \\nabla \\boldsymbol{v}$. In Cartesian coordinates, the components of $\\boldsymbol{L}$ are given by $L_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j}$, where $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ correspond to the $x, y, z$ directions, respectively. We have $v_1 = v_x = ax$, $v_2 = v_y = by$, and $v_3 = v_z = cz$. The components are calculated as follows:\n$L_{11} = \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(ax)}{\\partial x} = a$\n$L_{12} = \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(ax)}{\\partial y} = 0$\n$L_{13} = \\frac{\\partial v_x}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial(ax)}{\\partial z} = 0$\n$L_{21} = \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(by)}{\\partial x} = 0$\n$L_{22} = \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(by)}{\\partial y} = b$\n$L_{23} = \\frac{\\partial v_y}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial(by)}{\\partial z} = 0$\n$L_{31} = \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial(cz)}{\\partial x} = 0$\n$L_{32} = \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial(cz)}{\\partial y} = 0$\n$L_{33} = \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial(cz)}{\\partial z} = c$\nAssembling these components into a matrix, we obtain the velocity gradient tensor:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} a  0  0 \\\\ 0  b  0 \\\\ 0  0  c \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we compute the rate-of-deformation tensor, $\\boldsymbol{D}$, and the spin tensor, $\\boldsymbol{W}$. These are the symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor $\\boldsymbol{L}$, respectively. They are defined as:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L} + \\boldsymbol{L}^T) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\boldsymbol{W} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L} - \\boldsymbol{L}^T) $$\nThe transpose of $\\boldsymbol{L}$ is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{L}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} a  0  0 \\\\ 0  b  0 \\\\ 0  0  c \\end{pmatrix}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} a  0  0 \\\\ 0  b  0 \\\\ 0  0  c \\end{pmatrix} = \\boldsymbol{L} $$\nSince $\\boldsymbol{L}$ is a diagonal matrix, it is symmetric, meaning $\\boldsymbol{L}^T = \\boldsymbol{L}$.\nSubstituting this into the definition for $\\boldsymbol{D}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{D} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L} + \\boldsymbol{L}) = \\boldsymbol{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} a  0  0 \\\\ 0  b  0 \\\\ 0  0  c \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor the spin tensor $\\boldsymbol{W}$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{W} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{L} - \\boldsymbol{L}) = \\boldsymbol{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis indicates that the flow is irrotational, meaning a material element does not undergo rigid-body rotation.\n\nThe volumetric strain rate is defined as the trace of the rate-of-deformation tensor, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{D})$.

A material is defined as locally incompressible if the density of any given material particle remains constant over time, which means $\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt} = 0$. Substituting this condition into the continuity equation, we get $\\rho(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}) = 0$. Since the density $\\rho$ must be positive, this implies that the necessary and sufficient condition for local incompressibility is $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} = 0$. Based on our previous calculation, this condition is equivalent to $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{D}) = a + b + c = 0$.\n\nThe sign of the volumetric strain rate, $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{D})$, has a direct physical interpretation. It represents the rate of change of volume per unit volume of an infinitesimal material element.\n- If $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{D}) = a + b + c  0$, the material element is undergoing local volume expansion, also known as dilatation.\n- If $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{D}) = a + b + c  0$, the material element is undergoing local volume contraction, or compression.\n- If $\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{D}) = a + b + c = 0$, the deformation is volume-preserving (isochoric), which corresponds to the condition of incompressibility.\n\nSummarizing the computed quantities:\n$\\boldsymbol{L} = \\begin{pmatrix} a  0  0 \\\\ 0  b  0 \\\\ 0  0  c \\end{pmatrix}$,\n$\\boldsymbol{D} = \\begin{pmatrix} a  0  0 \\\\ 0  b  0 \\\\ 0  0  c \\end{pmatrix}$,\n$\\boldsymbol{W} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$,\n$\\operatorname{tr}(\\boldsymbol{D}) = a + b + c$.",

Evaluation of the Relative Error**\n\nThe problem defines the relative error $e_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ using the Frobenius norm of the tensors:\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\|\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\mathbf{E}\\|_{F}}{\\|\\mathbf{E}\\|_{F}}\n$$\nWe first find the difference tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\mathbf{E} = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\lambda_{1} - 1) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_{1}^{2} - 1)  0 \\\\ 0  (\\lambda_{2} - 1) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_{2}^{2} - 1) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet's simplify the diagonal components. For a generic stretch $\\lambda$:\n$$\n(\\lambda - 1) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda^2 - 1) = \\lambda - 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 + \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda^2 + \\lambda - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda^2 - 2\\lambda + 1) = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda - 1)^2\n$$\nThus, the difference tensor is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\mathbf{E} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_{1} - 1)^2  0 \\\\ 0  -\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_{2} - 1)^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we compute the Frobenius norms. The Frobenius norm of a general matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is $\\|\\mathbf{A}\\|_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}^2}$.\nFor the tensor $\\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{E}\\|_F = \\sqrt{E_{11}^2 + E_{22}^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_{1}^{2} - 1)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_{2}^{2} - 1)\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\lambda_{1}^{2} - 1)^2 + (\\lambda_{2}^{2} - 1)^2}\n$$\nFor the difference tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\mathbf{E}$:\n$$\n\\|\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} - \\mathbf{E}\\|_F = \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_{1} - 1)^2\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda_{2} - 1)^2\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\lambda_{1} - 1)^4 + (\\lambda_{2} - 1)^4}\n$$\nThe relative error is the ratio of these two norms:\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\lambda_{1} - 1)^4 + (\\lambda_{2} - 1)^4}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{(\\lambda_{1}^{2} - 1)^2 + (\\lambda_{2}^{2} - 1)^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{(\\lambda_{1} - 1)^4 + (\\lambda_{2} - 1)^4}}{\\sqrt{(\\lambda_{1}^{2} - 1)^2 + (\\lambda_{2}^{2} - 1)^2}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the numerical values $\\lambda_1 = 1.1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1.2$.\nThe numerator term becomes:\n$$\n\\sqrt{(\\lambda_{1} - 1)^4 + (\\lambda_{2} - 1)^4} = \\sqrt{(1.1 - 1)^4 + (1.2 - 1)^4} = \\sqrt{(0.1)^4 + (0.2)^4} = \\sqrt{0.0001 + 0.0016} = \\sqrt{0.0017}\n$$\nThe denominator term becomes:\n$$\n\\sqrt{(\\lambda_{1}^{2} - 1)^2 + (\\lambda_{2}^{2} - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{((1.1)^2 - 1)^2 + ((1.2)^2 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{(1.21 - 1)^2 + (1.44 - 1)^2} = \\sqrt{(0.21)^2 + (0.44)^2} = \\sqrt{0.0441 + 0.1936} = \\sqrt{0.2377}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio:\n$$\ne_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.0017}}{\\sqrt{0.2377}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0017}{0.2377}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0071518721} \\approx 0.08456874...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.08457$.\nThis value represents the relative error of the infinitesimal strain tensor approximation with respect to the exact Green-Lagrange strain tensor for the given finite deformation.",
