Specifically, $J = \\frac{dv}{dV}$, the ratio of a differential volume element $dv$ in the deformed configuration to the corresponding volume element $dV$ in the reference configuration. A value of $J=1$ implies that $dv=dV$, which signifies that the deformation is isochoric, or volume-preserving. In biomechanics, soft tissues are largely composed of water, which is nearly incompressible. Therefore, it is a very common and physically reasonable approximation to model soft tissues as incompressible materials. The condition $J=1$ mathematically formalizes this principle of incompressibility.\n\nTo ensure that the material behaves incompressibly for any imposed axial stretch $\\lambda > 0$, the condition $J=1$ must hold universally. We set our derived expression for $J$ equal to $1$:\n$$ \\lambda^{1 - 2\\nu} = 1 $$\nFor this equation to be satisfied for any arbitrary $\\lambda$ (excluding the trivial case of no deformation, $\\lambda=1$), the exponent must be identically zero.\n$$ 1 - 2\\nu = 0 $$\nSolving this equation for $\\nu$ gives the required condition:\n$$ 2\\nu = 1 \\implies \\nu = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThus, a lateral contraction exponent of $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2}$ is necessary for the deformation to be incompressible.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard exercise in finite deformation continuum mechanics, specifically applied to an idealized model of soft tissue, which is a common approach in biomechanics. The givens are self-contained and sufficient to derive a unique solution for the requested strain components. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe deformation is a homogeneous uniaxial stretch along the $\\mathbf{E}_{1}$ direction. The position vector of a particle in the reference (undeformed) configuration is $\\mathbf{X} = X_{1}\\mathbf{E}_{1} + X_{2}\\mathbf{E}_{2} + X_{3}\\mathbf{E}_{3}$, and its position in the current (deformed) configuration is $\\mathbf{x} = x_{1}\\mathbf{E}_{1} + x_{2}\\mathbf{E}_{2} + x_{3}\\mathbf{E}_{3}$.

The material is incompressible, which imposes the kinematic constraint that the volume ratio $J$ must be unity. The volume ratio is the determinant of the deformation gradient tensor, $J = \\det(\\mathbf{F})$. For this coaxial deformation, $J = \\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}\\lambda_{3} = 1$. The problem also states that the lateral faces are traction-free, which for an isotropic or transversely isotropic material (as is implicitly assumed for a prismatic tendon specimen under uniaxial load) implies that the lateral stretches are equal: $\\lambda_{2} = \\lambda_{3}$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the incompressibility constraint:\n$$\\lambda \\lambda_{2}^{2} = 1 \\implies \\lambda_{2}^{2} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\implies \\lambda_{2} = \\lambda^{-1/2}$$\nThus, the principal stretches are $\\lambda_{1} = \\lambda$, $\\lambda_{2} = \\lambda^{-1/2}$, and $\\lambda_{3} = \\lambda^{-1/2}$.\n\nThe deformation gradient tensor $\\mathbf{F}$ is defined as $\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{\\partial\\mathbf{x}}{\\partial\\mathbf{X}}$.

This tensor is a material measure of strain, defined with respect to the reference configuration. It is derived from the right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^{T}\\mathbf{F}$.

This tensor is a spatial measure of strain, defined with respect to the current configuration. It is derived from the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor (or Finger tensor) $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{F}^{T}$. In this case, since $\\mathbf{F}$ is symmetric, $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{C}$.\n$$[\\mathbf{B}] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe Euler–Almansi strain tensor is defined as $\\mathbf{e} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{B}^{-1})$. First, we find the inverse of $\\mathbf{B}$:\n$$[\\mathbf{B}^{-1}] = ([\\mathbf{B}])^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^{-2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we can compute $\\mathbf{e}$:\n$$[\\mathbf{e}] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^{-2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda^{-2}) & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda) \\end{pmatrix}$$\nFrom this matrix, we identify the axial and lateral normal components of the Euler–Almansi strain tensor:\nThe axial component is $e_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda^{-2})$.\nThe lateral component is $e_{22} = e_{33} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda)$.\n\nTo compare these measures, consider a tensile stretch where $\\lambda > 1$.\nFor the axial components:\n$E_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda^2 - 1)$ is positive, indicating tension.\n$e_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda^{-2}) = E_{11}\\lambda^{-2}$ is also positive. As $\\lambda > 1$, we have $\\lambda^{-2} < 1$, which means $e_{11} < E_{11}$. The Green–Lagrange strain, which measures the change in squared length relative to the initial length, yields a larger value for tensile strain than the Euler–Almansi strain, which measures change relative to the larger final length.\n\nFor the lateral components:\n$E_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda^{-1} - 1)$ is negative, as $\\lambda > 1 \\implies \\lambda^{-1} < 1$. This correctly indicates lateral contraction.\n$e_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda)$ is also negative.\nTo compare their magnitudes, we analyze $|E_{22}| = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda^{-1}) = \\frac{\\lambda-1}{2\\lambda}$ and $|e_{22}| = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda - 1)$.\nSince $\\lambda > 1$, we have $2\\lambda > 2$, which implies $\\frac{1}{2\\lambda} < \\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $\\frac{\\lambda-1}{2\\lambda} < \\frac{\\lambda-1}{2}$, and thus $|E_{22}| < |e_{22}|$. The magnitude of the compressive lateral strain as measured by the spatial Euler–Almansi tensor is greater than that measured by the material Green–Lagrange tensor. This is because $\\mathbf{e}$ measures strain relative to the final (laterally compressed) configuration, while $\\mathbf{E}$ measures it relative to the initial (larger lateral dimension) configuration.\n\nBoth tensors correctly capture the sign of the strains (axial tension, lateral compression). For small deformations where $\\lambda \\approx 1$, both tensors approximate to the infinitesimal strain tensor. However, for finite deformations, their values diverge significantly due to their different reference frames (material vs. spatial).\n\nThe problem requires reporting the four principal normal components $E_{11}$, $E_{22}$, $e_{11}$, and $e_{22}$.\n$E_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda^{2} - 1)$\n$E_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\lambda^{-1} - 1)$\n$e_{11} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda^{-2})$\n$e_{22} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\lambda)$\nThese are the final expressions for the required components.",
