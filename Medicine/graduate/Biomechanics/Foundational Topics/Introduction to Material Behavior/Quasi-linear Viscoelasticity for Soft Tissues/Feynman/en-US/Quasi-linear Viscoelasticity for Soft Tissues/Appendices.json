            "solution": "The user has requested a critical validation of the problem statement, followed by a detailed solution and evaluation of the given options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Topic:** Quasi-Linear Viscoelasticity (QLV) for soft tissues.\n- **Underlying Theory:** Boltzmann superposition principle for hereditary materials.\n- **Core QLV Assumption (to be tested):** The stress response is separable into a strain-independent reduced relaxation function, $G(t)$, and a nonlinear elastic response, $\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon)$.\n- **Experimental Protocol:** A series of stress relaxation tests.\n    - Each test starts from a pre-strain level $\\varepsilon_p$, held long enough to reach a steady baseline stress $\\sigma_{\\text{baseline}}$.\n    - At time $t=0$, a small, rapid step increase in strain $\\Delta \\varepsilon$ is applied.\n    - The total strain for $t \\ge 0$ is $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_p + \\Delta \\varepsilon \\, H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function.\n    - The loading ramp is assumed to be instantaneous.\n    - The step amplitude $\\Delta \\varepsilon$ is identical across all tests performed at different $\\varepsilon_p$.\n    - The measured output is the incremental stress response, $\\Delta \\sigma(t) \\equiv \\sigma(t) - \\sigma_{\\text{baseline}}$, for $t0$.\n- **Objective:** To identify the correct protocol and normalization method for testing the separability assumption by demonstrating the collapse of experimental curves to a single reduced relaxation function $G(t)$.

C. Fung. QLV is a standard and widely used model in soft tissue biomechanics. The separability assumption is the central tenet of this theory, and the described experimental protocol (a small strain step superimposed upon a finite pre-strain) is the classic method designed specifically to validate this assumption. All concepts are standard within the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear conceptual framework and a specific question: to identify the correct experimental procedure and data analysis method from a set of options. It is well-posed for a conceptual physics/engineering problem.\n- **Objective (Critical):** The problem statement is expressed in precise, objective, and standard scientific terminology. There is no subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It accurately describes a standard scenario in experimental biomechanics. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe general form of the one-dimensional QLV constitutive law, as proposed by Fung, is a hereditary integral:\n$$ \\sigma(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-\\tau) \\frac{d\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} d\\tau $$\nwhere $\\sigma(t)$ is the stress at time $t$, $G(t)$ is the reduced relaxation function (normalized such that $G(0)=1$), $\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon)$ is the instantaneous elastic response (a function of strain $\\varepsilon$), and $\\tau$ is the time variable of integration.\n\nUsing the chain rule, the derivative inside the integral can be expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} = \\frac{d\\sigma_e}{d\\varepsilon} \\frac{d\\varepsilon}{d\\tau} = \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon(\\tau)) \\dot{\\varepsilon}(\\tau) $$\nHere, $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e$ is the instantaneous tangent elastic modulus, which is generally a function of strain.\n\nThe problem describes an experiment where a small step strain $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ is superimposed on a static pre-strain $\\varepsilon_p$. The total strain history is $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_p + \\Delta\\varepsilon H(t)$. For this analysis, we assume the tissue has been held at $\\varepsilon_p$ for a sufficiently long time to reach an equilibrium state with baseline stress $\\sigma_{\\text{baseline}}$. The perturbation $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ is applied at $t=0$.\n\nWe are interested in the incremental stress response, $\\Delta\\sigma(t) = \\sigma(t) - \\sigma_{\\text{baseline}}$, for $t > 0$. Since the perturbation $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ is small, we can linearize the change in the elastic response around the pre-strain $\\varepsilon_p$. The stress contribution from the small step is added to the pre-existing baseline stress.\n\nThe strain rate corresponding to the step is $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\Delta\\varepsilon \\, \\delta(t)$, where $\\delta(t)$ is the Dirac delta function. This impulse occurs at $t=0$. The strain level at the moment of the impulse is changing from $\\varepsilon_p$ to $\\varepsilon_p + \\Delta\\varepsilon$. For a small step, the tangent modulus can be evaluated at the pre-strain level, $\\varepsilon_p$.\n\nThe incremental stress $\\Delta\\sigma(t)$ is the response to the strain impulse. We can write this from the superposition integral. For $t0$:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma(t) = \\int_{0^{-}}^{t} G(t-\\tau) \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon(\\tau)) \\dot{\\varepsilon}(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nSubstituting $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(\\tau) = \\Delta\\varepsilon \\, \\delta(\\tau)$:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma(t) = \\int_{0^{-}}^{t} G(t-\\tau) \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon(\\tau)) [\\Delta\\varepsilon \\, \\delta(\\tau)] d\\tau $$\nThe term $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e$ is evaluated at the strain level where the impulse occurs. Since $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ is small, we can approximate $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon(\\tau)) \\approx \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$ for the duration of the impulse at $\\tau=0$. This term is constant with respect to the integration variable $\\tau$ and can be taken outside the integral:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma(t) \\approx \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p) \\Delta\\varepsilon \\int_{0^{-}}^{t} G(t-\\tau) \\delta(\\tau) d\\tau $$\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, the integral evaluates to $G(t)$. Thus, the incremental stress response is:\n$$ \\Delta\\sigma(t) \\approx [\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p) \\Delta\\varepsilon] G(t) $$\nThis is the core prediction of QLV theory for this experiment. It shows that the incremental stress relaxation curve, $\\Delta\\sigma(t)$, has a shape given by the reduced relaxation function $G(t)$, and its amplitude is determined by the product of the instantaneous tangent modulus at the pre-strain, $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$, and the step magnitude, $\\Delta\\varepsilon$.\n\nTo test the separability assumption, one must verify if the function $G(t)$ is indeed independent of the strain level $\\varepsilon_p$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $G(t)$:\n$$ G(t) \\approx \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma(t)}{\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p) \\Delta\\varepsilon} $$\nThe experimental protocol involves performing this test at several different pre-strain levels $\\varepsilon_p$, while keeping $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ constant. If separability holds, then for each test $i$ performed at pre-strain $\\varepsilon_{p,i}$, the calculated function $G_i(t)$ should be identical. Therefore, plotting the normalized quantity $\\Delta\\sigma(t) / \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$ versus time for all tests should result in all curves collapsing onto a single master curve. Since $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ is a constant factor in all tests, it does not affect the collapse. The resulting master curve would be equal to $\\Delta\\varepsilon \\, G(t)$.\n\nThis confirms that a valid test requires:\n1.  Measurement of the incremental stress relaxation $\\Delta\\sigma(t)$.\n2.  An independent measurement of the instantaneous tangent modulus $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$ at each pre-strain level. This requires very fast loading to minimize viscous relaxation during the measurement.\n3.  Normalization of $\\Delta\\sigma(t)$ by $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At each $\\varepsilon_p$, impose an identical small, fast step $\\Delta \\varepsilon$ and record $\\Delta \\sigma(t)$. Independently estimate the tangent elastic modulus $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$ from an instantaneous stress–strain characterization (using very fast ramps to minimize relaxation) at the same pre-strain. Plot $\\Delta \\sigma(t)/\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$ versus $t$ for all $\\varepsilon_p$; if the curves coincide, the collapsed curve is proportional to $G(t)$ and supports separability. The step amplitude being identical implies the collapsed curve equals $\\Delta \\varepsilon\\,G(t)$. Avoid estimating $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e$ from slow ramps (which reflect equilibrium stiffness) and ensure the ramp is fast enough that the recorded response is not contaminated by relaxation during loading.**\n\nThis option precisely matches the procedure derived from first principles. It correctly identifies (1) the need to measure $\\Delta\\sigma(t)$, (2) the correct normalization factor as the instantaneous tangent modulus $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$, (3) the correct method to measure this modulus (fast ramps), (4) the correct interpretation of the collapsed curve as being proportional to $G(t)$, and (5) the critical pitfalls of using equilibrium properties or slow ramps.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. At each $\\varepsilon_p$, apply the step and plot the total stress $\\sigma(t)$ divided by the instantaneous total stress value $\\sigma(0^{+})$ without subtracting the baseline. Collapse of $\\sigma(t)/\\sigma(0^{+})$ to a single curve demonstrates separability, and no independent estimate of $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e$ is necessary. Estimating stiffness from slow ramps is acceptable since the ratio eliminates errors.**\n\nThis option is flawed. The proposed normalization is $\\sigma(t)/\\sigma(0^+)$. Let's analyze this ratio:\n$\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{\\text{baseline}} + \\Delta\\sigma(t) = G(\\infty)\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p) + \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)\\Delta\\varepsilon G(t)$.\n$\\sigma(0^+) = \\sigma_{\\text{baseline}} + \\Delta\\sigma(0^+) = G(\\infty)\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p) + \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)\\Delta\\varepsilon G(0) = G(\\infty)\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p) + \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)\\Delta\\varepsilon$.\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma(t)}{\\sigma(0^+)} = \\frac{G(\\infty)\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p) + \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)\\Delta\\varepsilon G(t)}{G(\\infty)\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p) + \\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)\\Delta\\varepsilon} $$\nThis expression depends on $\\varepsilon_p$ through both $\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$ and $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$. The ratio will not be independent of $\\varepsilon_p$ for a general nonlinear elastic function $\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon)$. Therefore, the curves will not collapse. The claim that this demonstrates separability is false. Furthermore, the statement that estimating stiffness from slow ramps is acceptable is fundamentally incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. At each $\\varepsilon_p$, apply the step with any convenient amplitude (amplitudes may differ across tests). Normalize the relaxation curves by the secant modulus $\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)/\\varepsilon_p$ evaluated from quasi-static tests; collapse of $\\Delta \\sigma(t)/(\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)/\\varepsilon_p)$ demonstrates separability because the secant modulus captures the strain dependence of $\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon)$.**\n\nThis option has multiple errors. First, the correct modulus for the incremental response is the tangent modulus, $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$, not the secant modulus, $\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)/\\varepsilon_p$. Second, it suggests evaluating the modulus from quasi-static tests. This would yield an equilibrium modulus, not the required instantaneous modulus $\\sigma_e$. The use of differing amplitudes $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ would require normalizing by $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ as well, which is not mentioned. The proposed normalization scheme is physically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. At each $\\varepsilon_p$, apply the step and normalize $\\Delta \\sigma(t)$ by $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(0)$, i.e., the tangent modulus evaluated at zero strain, which is a material constant. If the normalized curves collapse, separability holds; if they do not, nonlinearity in $\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon)$ is negligible and can be ignored for testing separability. Ensure that the loading ramp is slow enough to avoid inertial artifacts even if relaxation occurs during the ramp.**\n\nThis option is incorrect. The normalization factor must be the strain-dependent tangent modulus $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)$ to account for the changing stiffness at each pre-strain. Normalizing by a constant, $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(0)$, would yield curves whose amplitudes are scaled by $\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon_p)/\\partial_{\\varepsilon}\\sigma_e(0)$, which is a function of $\\varepsilon_p$. Thus, the curves will not collapse if $\\sigma_e$ is nonlinear. The logical statement that follows is also flawed and inverted: non-collapse would *prove* that nonlinearity is significant, not negligible. Most critically, the advice to use a slow ramp is directly antithetical to the requirements of the test, as it would conflate relaxation with the elastic response, making it impossible to separate $G(t)$ from $\\sigma_e(\\varepsilon)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "solution": "The Quasi-Linear Viscoelasticity (QLV) model formulated by Fung is a cornerstone in the biomechanics of soft tissues. This response addresses the provided problem in three parts as requested: an explanation of the theoretical challenge in computing creep response, the specification of a numerical algorithm, and its implementation.\n\n### Task 1: Explanation of the Challenge in Computing Creep\n\nThe constitutive relation for a one-dimensional QLV material is given by the hereditary integral:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} G(t-\\tau) \\frac{d\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} d\\tau\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma(t)$ is the Cauchy stress, $\\varepsilon(t)$ is the strain, $G(t)$ is the reduced relaxation function with $G(0)=1$, and $\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon)$ is the time-independent (instantaneous) elastic stress response, which is a nonlinear function of strain for most soft tissues.\n\nA creep test involves applying a constant stress, $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0}$ for $t0$, to a previously unstressed and unstrained specimen, and measuring the resulting strain history $\\varepsilon(t)$. Substituting the creep condition into the QLV integral gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_{0} = \\int_{0}^{t} G(t-\\tau) \\frac{d\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} d\\tau, \\quad \\text{for } t0\n$$\nThis equation is a Volterra integral equation of the first kind for the unknown function $f(t) = \\frac{d\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon(t))}{dt}$. Obtaining the strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ is not straightforward for several reasons:\n\n1.  **Implicit and Nonlinear Nature**: The unknown function, $\\varepsilon(t)$, is embedded within the nonlinear function $\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon)$, which is then differentiated and integrated. The equation does not provide a direct expression for $\\varepsilon(t)$. Instead, it implicitly defines $\\varepsilon(t)$ through a complex integral relationship.\n2.  **Integral Equation for a Derivative**: The direct unknown in the integral is not $\\varepsilon(t)$ but the rate of change of the elastic stress, $\\frac{d\\sigma^{e}}{d\\tau}$. To find $\\varepsilon(t)$, one would first need to solve this integral equation for $\\frac{d\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau}$, then integrate the result with respect to time to find $\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon(t))$, and finally invert the nonlinear function $\\sigma^{e}$ to solve for $\\varepsilon(t)$. Each of these steps is non-trivial.\n3.  **Numerical Inversion Required**: Unlike linear viscoelasticity where the creep compliance $J(t)$ can often be found analytically or via Laplace transforms from the relaxation modulus, the nonlinearity of $\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon)$ in the QLV model prevents the use of such direct methods. The separability of time and strain effects, which defines QLV, does not simplify to a separable solution for strain in a creep test.\n\nDue to these analytical difficulties, a numerical approach is required. A robust method is to discretize the integral in time and solve for the unknown strain step-by-step. We propose a product-integration scheme. The time interval $[0, T]$ is discretized into $N$ steps of size $\\Delta t$, with $t_n = n\\Delta t$. The integral is approximated as a sum over these time steps. By evaluating the kernel $G(t_n-\\tau)$ at the right endpoint of each subinterval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$, we can isolate the most recent unknown increment of elastic stress, $\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_n) - \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n-1})$, allowing for an iterative solution. This is detailed in the next section.\n\n### Task 2: Numerical Scheme and Algorithm Specification\n\nWe discretize the time domain as $t_n = n\\Delta t$ for $n=0, 1, \\dots, N$. Let $\\varepsilon_k = \\varepsilon(t_k)$ and $\\sigma_n = \\sigma(t_n)$. The hereditary integral at time $t_n$ is:\n$$\n\\sigma_n = \\int_{0}^{t_n} G(t_n-\\tau) \\frac{d\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} d\\tau = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} G(t_n-\\tau) \\frac{d\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} d\\tau\n$$\nUsing a product right-endpoint rule, we approximate the integral over each subinterval $[t_{k-1}, t_k]$ by evaluating the relatively smooth function $G(t_n-\\tau)$ at the right endpoint $\\tau=t_k$:\n$$\n\\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} G(t_n-\\tau) \\frac{d\\sigma^{e}}{d\\tau} d\\tau \\approx G(t_n-t_k) \\int_{t_{k-1}}^{t_k} \\frac{d\\sigma^{e}}{d\\tau} d\\tau = G(t_n-t_k) \\left[ \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_k) - \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{k-1}) \\right]\n$$\nLetting $\\Delta \\sigma_{k}^{e} = \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{k}) - \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{k-1})$, the discrete form of the hereditary relation becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_n \\approx \\sum_{k=1}^{n} G(t_n-t_k) \\Delta \\sigma_{k}^{e}\n$$\nFor a creep test, $\\sigma_n = \\sigma_0$ for $n \\ge 1$. The initial conditions at $t_0=0$ are $\\varepsilon_0=0$ and thus $\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_0)=0$. Substituting the creep condition and separating the last term ($k=n$) of the sum gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_0 = G(t_n-t_n)\\Delta \\sigma_{n}^{e} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} G(t_n-t_k) \\Delta \\sigma_{k}^{e}\n$$\nUsing $G(0) = 1$ and expanding $\\Delta \\sigma_{n}^{e} = \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n}) - \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n-1})$, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma_0 = \\left[ \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n}) - \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n-1}) \\right] + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} G(t_n-t_k) \\left( \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{k}) - \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{k-1}) \\right)\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the unknown elastic stress at the current time step, $\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n})$, yields the explicit recursion:\n$$\n\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n}) = \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n-1}) + \\sigma_{0} - \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} G(t_{n}-t_{k})\\left(\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{k}) - \\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{k-1})\\right)\n$$\nAt each time step $n$, the right-hand side is fully determined by the applied stress $\\sigma_0$ and the history of elastic stress up to step $n-1$. Let the target value on the right-hand side be $\\sigma^{e}_{\\text{target}}$. We must then solve the nonlinear algebraic equation\n$$\n\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n}) = \\sigma^{e}_{\\text{target}}\n$$\nfor the unknown strain $\\varepsilon_{n}$. For the specified form $\\sigma^e(\\varepsilon) = E_0 \\varepsilon e^{\\alpha\\varepsilon}$ with $E_0, \\alpha  0$, the function is strictly monotonic for $\\varepsilon \\ge 0$. This guarantees a unique positive root for any positive $\\sigma^{e}_{\\text{target}}$.\n\nA robust numerical method for finding this root is the **bisection method**. To apply it, we need to find an interval $[a, b]$ that brackets the root.\n1.  Define the function to be zeroed: $f(\\varepsilon) = \\sigma^e(\\varepsilon) - \\sigma^{e}_{\\text{target}}$.\n2.  The lower bound of the search is $a=0$. Since $\\sigma^e(0)=0$ and $\\sigma^{e}_{\\text{target}}0$ for a creep test, $f(0) = -\\sigma^{e}_{\\text{target}}  0$.\n3.  An upper bound $b$ must be found such that $f(b)  0$. We can use an adaptive search: start with an initial guess, e.g., $b=0.1$. If $f(b) \\le 0$, repeatedly double $b$ until $f(b)  0$. Given the exponential growth of $\\sigma^e(\\varepsilon)$, this search is guaranteed to terminate quickly.\n4.  With the root bracketed in $[a,b]$, the bisection algorithm can be applied to converge to $\\varepsilon_n$ within a specified tolerance.\n\nThe summation term in the recursion, if computed directly at each step, leads to an $O(N^2)$ algorithm. For the Prony series form of $G(t)$, this computation can be optimized to $O(N)$ by using a recursive update scheme. The summation can be written as:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} G(t_n-t_k) \\Delta \\sigma_{k}^{e} = g_{\\infty}\\sigma^{e}(\\varepsilon_{n-1}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} g_i \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} e^{-(n-k)\\Delta t/\\tau_i} \\Delta \\sigma_{k}^{e}\n$$\nThe inner sums can be related to history variables, $H_{n-1, i} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} e^{-(n-1-k)\\Delta t/\\tau_i} \\Delta \\sigma_{k}^{e}$, that are updated recursively:\n$$\nH_{n,i} = \\Delta\\sigma_n^e + e^{-\\Delta t/\\tau_i} H_{n-1,i}\n$$\nThis makes the evaluation of the history term at each step an $O(m)$ operation, where $m$ is the number of Prony terms, resulting in an overall $O(Nm)$ algorithm.",
