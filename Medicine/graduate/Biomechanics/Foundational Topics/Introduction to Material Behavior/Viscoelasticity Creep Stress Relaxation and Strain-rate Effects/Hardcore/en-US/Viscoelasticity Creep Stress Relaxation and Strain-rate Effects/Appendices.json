            "introduction": "The behavior of a linear viscoelastic material can be characterized through two cornerstone experiments: stress relaxation, which measures the stress decay under constant strain, and creep, which measures the strain increase under constant stress. These phenomena are described by the relaxation modulus $G(t)$ and creep compliance $J(t)$, respectively. This exercise guides you through a foundational derivation to demonstrate that these two functions are not independent but are intimately linked through a duality relationship, a direct consequence of the material's assumed linearity and causality. Mastering this derivation  is essential for a deep understanding of the constitutive framework of linear viscoelasticity.",

            "solution": "**Part A: Derivation of the Hereditary Integral for Strain**\n\nWe begin by modeling the strain response, $\\epsilon(t)$, to an arbitrary stress history, $\\sigma(t')$, for $t' \\ge 0$. The material is assumed to be linear, causal, and time-invariant (LTI), with a vanishing history for $t0$.\n\nFirst, we define the creep compliance, $J(t)$, as the strain response to a unit step stress applied at $t=0$. If the stress history is the Heaviside step function, $\\sigma(t) = u(t)$, then the strain response is $\\epsilon(t) = J(t)$.\n\nBy the assumption of time-invariance, if the stress step is applied at some time $t'$, i.e., $\\sigma(t) = u(t-t')$, the strain response is $\\epsilon(t) = J(t-t')$.\n\nBy the assumption of linearity, if the magnitude of the step stress is $\\Delta\\sigma$, i.e., $\\sigma(t) = \\Delta\\sigma \\cdot u(t-t')$, the strain response is $\\epsilon(t) = \\Delta\\sigma \\cdot J(t-t')$. Causality is implicit, as $J(t-t')=0$ for $t  t'$.\n\nNow, we represent an arbitrary stress history $\\sigma(t)$ as a superposition of infinitesimal step stresses. The stress history begins at $t=0$. We can approximate the stress curve $\\sigma(t')$ as a series of small, discrete step changes. At time $t'=0$, there is a step of magnitude $\\sigma(0)$. For any subsequent time $t' > 0$, we consider a small time interval $[t', t'+dt']$. The change in stress during this interval is $d\\sigma(t') = \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt'}(t') dt'$. This infinitesimal change can be treated as a small step stress of magnitude $d\\sigma(t')$ occurring at time $t'$.\n\nThe strain response at a later time $t$ due to this infinitesimal stress step $d\\sigma(t')$ is given by $d\\epsilon(t) = J(t-t') d\\sigma(t')$.\n\nThe total strain $\\epsilon(t)$ is the sum (integral) of the responses to all such past stress increments, by the Boltzmann superposition principle. This includes the initial step at $t'=0$ and all subsequent infinitesimal steps up to time $t$.\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = J(t)\\sigma(0) + \\int_{0^+}^{t} J(t-t') \\frac{d\\sigma}{dt'}(t') dt'\n$$\nThis expression is a form of the hereditary integral. It is more compactly written using the Stieltjes integral, which naturally incorporates both the initial finite step and the continuous changes:\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = \\int_{0^{-}}^{t} J(t-t') d\\sigma(t')\n$$\nIf we assume $\\sigma(t)$ is differentiable for $t>0$, we can write $d\\sigma(t') = \\dot{\\sigma}(t') dt'$. The general stress rate, including the possible jump at $t=0$, can be written as $\\dot{\\sigma}_{gen}(t') = \\sigma(0)\\delta(t') + \\dot{\\sigma}(t')$, where $\\delta(t')$ is the Dirac delta function. Substituting this into the integral over $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ and using causality ($J(\\tau)=0$ for $\\tau0$):\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} J(t-t') \\dot{\\sigma}_{gen}(t') dt' = \\int_{0}^{t} J(t-t') \\dot{\\sigma}_{gen}(t') dt'\n$$\nThis is precisely the definition of a causal convolution.\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = (J * \\dot{\\sigma}_{gen})(t)\n$$\nThus, the strain response $\\epsilon(t)$ is expressible as the causal convolution of a kernel with the generalized stress rate $\\dot{\\sigma}_{gen}(t')$. The kernel of this convolution is identified as the creep compliance, $J(t)$.\n\n**Part B: Laplace-Domain Duality**\n\nThe LTI nature of the material response allows for a dual representation. The stress $\\sigma(t)$ can be expressed as a convolution of the relaxation modulus $G(t)$ with the strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)$, and the strain $\\epsilon(t)$ can be expressed as a convolution of the creep compliance $J(t)$ with the stress rate $\\dot{\\sigma}(t)$. For vanishing initial histories ($\\sigma(t)=0, \\epsilon(t)=0$ for $t0$):\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_0^t G(t-t') \\dot{\\epsilon}(t') dt' = (G * \\dot{\\epsilon})(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) = \\int_0^t J(t-t') \\dot{\\sigma}(t') dt' = (J * \\dot{\\sigma})(t)\n$$\nWe use the Laplace transform, denoted by $\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = \\hat{f}(s)$. The key properties we need are the convolution theorem, $\\mathcal{L}\\{(f*g)(t)\\} = \\hat{f}(s)\\hat{g}(s)$, and the differentiation theorem, $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{f}(t)\\} = s\\hat{f}(s) - f(0)$. Given vanishing initial histories, $f(0)=0$.\n\nTaking the Laplace transform of the first equation:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{(G * \\dot{\\epsilon})(t)\\} = \\hat{G}(s) \\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{\\epsilon}(t)\\} = \\hat{G}(s) \\cdot s \\hat{\\epsilon}(s)\n$$\nTaking the Laplace transform of the second equation:\n$$\n\\hat{\\epsilon}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{(J * \\dot{\\sigma})(t)\\} = \\hat{J}(s) \\mathcal{L}\\{\\dot{\\sigma}(t)\\} = \\hat{J}(s) \\cdot s \\hat{\\sigma}(s)\n$$\nFrom the first transformed equation, we can write the ratio $\\hat{\\epsilon}(s) / \\hat{\\sigma}(s)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{\\epsilon}(s)}{\\hat{\\sigma}(s)} = \\frac{1}{s \\hat{G}(s)}\n$$\nFrom the second transformed equation, we find the same ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{\\epsilon}(s)}{\\hat{\\sigma}(s)} = s \\hat{J}(s)\n$$\nEquating these two expressions, assuming a non-trivial case where $\\hat{\\sigma}(s)$ and $\\hat{\\epsilon}(s)$ are not identically zero, we obtain the duality condition:\n$$\ns \\hat{J}(s) = \\frac{1}{s \\hat{G}(s)} \\implies s^2 \\hat{G}(s) \\hat{J}(s) = 1\n$$\nThe roles of the core assumptions are critical:\n- **Linearity:** This assumption is fundamental as it enables the use of the superposition principle, which forms the basis for the convolution-integral representation of the stress-strain relationship. Without linearity, the system's behavior could not be decomposed in this manner.\n- **Causality:** This assumption (response follows stimulus) ensures that the integration limits are from $0$ to $t$, justifying the use of the one-sided Laplace transform and its associated convolution theorem, which transforms the integral equations in the time domain into simple algebraic equations in the Laplace domain.\n\n**Part C: Creep Compliance for the Standard Linear Solid (SLS)**\n\nWe are given the relaxation modulus for the SLS model:\n$$\nG(t) = G_{\\infty} + \\bigl(G_{0} - G_{\\infty}\\bigr)\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{R}}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, we find its Laplace transform, $\\hat{G}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{G(t)\\}$.\n$$\n\\hat{G}(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{G_{\\infty}\\} + (G_{0} - G_{\\infty}) \\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{R}}\\right)\\right\\} = \\frac{G_{\\infty}}{s} + (G_{0} - G_{\\infty}) \\frac{1}{s + 1/\\tau_{R}}\n$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\hat{G}(s) = \\frac{G_{\\infty}(s + 1/\\tau_{R}) + s(G_{0} - G_{\\infty})}{s(s + 1/\\tau_{R})} = \\frac{G_{0}s + G_{\\infty}/\\tau_{R}}{s(s + 1/\\tau_{R})}\n$$\nNext, we use the duality relation from Part B, $s^2 \\hat{G}(s) \\hat{J}(s) = 1$, to find the Laplace transform of the creep compliance, $\\hat{J}(s)$:\n$$\n\\hat{J}(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2 \\hat{G}(s)} = \\frac{1}{s^2} \\left[ \\frac{s(s + 1/\\tau_{R})}{G_{0}s + G_{\\infty}/\\tau_{R}} \\right] = \\frac{s + 1/\\tau_{R}}{s(G_{0}s + G_{\\infty}/\\tau_{R})}\n$$\nTo perform the inverse Laplace transform, we use partial fraction expansion. Let the expansion be $\\hat{J}(s) = \\frac{A}{s} + \\frac{B}{s + \\frac{G_{\\infty}}{G_{0}\\tau_{R}}}$. We solve for coefficients A and B.\n$$\nA = \\left. s \\hat{J}(s) \\right|_{s=0} = \\left. \\frac{s + 1/\\tau_{R}}{G_{0}s + G_{\\infty}/\\tau_{R}} \\right|_{s=0} = \\frac{1/\\tau_R}{G_\\infty/\\tau_R} = \\frac{1}{G_\\infty}\n$$\n$$\nB = \\left. \\left(s + \\frac{G_{\\infty}}{G_{0}\\tau_{R}}\\right) \\hat{J}(s) \\right|_{s = -G_{\\infty}/(G_{0}\\tau_{R})} = \\left. \\frac{s+1/\\tau_R}{s G_0} \\right|_{s = -G_{\\infty}/(G_{0}\\tau_{R})} = \\frac{-G_{\\infty}/(G_{0}\\tau_{R}) + 1/\\tau_{R}}{(-G_{\\infty}/(G_{0}\\tau_{R})) G_0} = \\frac{(1/\\tau_R)(1 - G_\\infty/G_0)}{-G_\\infty/\\tau_R} = \\frac{G_0 - G_\\infty}{-G_0 G_\\infty} = \\frac{G_\\infty - G_0}{G_0 G_\\infty}\n$$\nSo, the expansion for $\\hat{J}(s)$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{J}(s) = \\frac{1}{G_{\\infty}s} + \\frac{G_{\\infty}-G_{0}}{G_0 G_\\infty}\\frac{1}{s + \\frac{G_{\\infty}}{G_{0}\\tau_{R}}}\n$$\nNow, we find the inverse Laplace transform $J(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{\\hat{J}(s)\\}$:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{1}{G_{\\infty}s}\\right\\} + \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{G_{\\infty}-G_{0}}{G_0 G_\\infty}\\frac{1}{s + \\frac{G_{\\infty}}{G_{0}\\tau_{R}}}\\right\\}\n$$\n$$\nJ(t) = \\frac{1}{G_{\\infty}} + \\frac{G_{\\infty}-G_{0}}{G_0 G_\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\infty}}{G_{0}\\tau_{R}}t\\right)\n$$\nThis can be written in an alternative, physically transparent form by noting that $J_g = 1/G_0$ and $J_e = 1/G_\\infty$:\n$$\nJ(t) = \\frac{1}{G_{\\infty}} + \\left(\\frac{1}{G_0} - \\frac{1}{G_{\\infty}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\infty}}{G_{0}\\tau_{R}}t\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the creep compliance $J(t)$.

            "solution": "The core of the problem is to apply the Boltzmann superposition principle to a material described by a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model subjected to a ramp-and-hold strain history.\n\nThe QLV constitutive law, assuming the separability of the elastic response and time-dependent behavior, is given by the hereditary integral:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} G(t-\\tau) \\frac{d S^{(e)}(\\epsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} d\\tau\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma(t)$ is the stress at time $t$, $G(t)$ is the reduced relaxation function, and $S^{(e)}(\\epsilon)$ is the instantaneous elastic stress-strain relationship.\n\nThe given functions are:\nInstantaneous elastic response: $S^{(e)}(\\epsilon) = E_{0}(\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon) - 1)$\nReduced relaxation function: $G(t) = g_{\\infty} + (1 - g_{\\infty})\\exp(-t/\\tau_{1})$\n\nThe strain history is a ramp-and-hold function:\n$$\n\\epsilon(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_{r} t,  0 \\le t \\le t_{r}\\\\\n\\epsilon_{0},  t  t_{r}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere the constant strain rate during the ramp is $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{r} = \\epsilon_{0}/t_{r}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the QLV stress response $\\sigma_{\\text{QLV}}(t)$ for $t \\ge t_{r}$. We require the time derivative of the elastic response, $\\frac{d S^{(e)}(\\epsilon(t))}{dt}$.\nFor the ramp phase ($0 \\le t \\le t_{r}$), $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_{0}t/t_{r}$.\n$$\nS^{(e)}(\\epsilon(t)) = E_{0}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}t}{t_{r}}\\right) - 1\\right)\n$$\nThe derivative with respect to time $\\tau$ (the integration variable) is:\n$$\n\\frac{d S^{(e)}(\\epsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} = E_{0} \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{r}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}\\tau}{t_{r}}\\right), \\quad 0 \\le \\tau \\le t_{r}\n$$\nFor the hold phase ($\\tau > t_{r}$), $\\epsilon(\\tau) = \\epsilon_{0}$ is constant, so:\n$$\n\\frac{d S^{(e)}(\\epsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} = 0, \\quad \\tau > t_{r}\n$$\nFor $t \\ge t_{r}$, the convolution integral simplifies because the derivative of the elastic response is non-zero only for $0 \\le \\tau \\le t_{r}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{QLV}}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t_{r}} G(t-\\tau) \\frac{d S^{(e)}(\\epsilon(\\tau))}{d\\tau} d\\tau\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $G(t-\\tau)$ and $\\frac{d S^{(e)}}{d\\tau}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{QLV}}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t_{r}} \\left[ g_{\\infty} + (1 - g_{\\infty})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-\\tau}{\\tau_{1}}\\right) \\right] \\left[ E_{0} \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{r}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}\\tau}{t_{r}}\\right) \\right] d\\tau\n$$\nWe can separate the integral into two parts:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{QLV}}(t) = E_{0} \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{r}} \\left[ g_{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{t_{r}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}\\tau}{t_{r}}\\right) d\\tau + (1 - g_{\\infty})\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{1}}\\right) \\int_{0}^{t_{r}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau_{1}}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}\\tau}{t_{r}}\\right) d\\tau \\right]\n$$\nSolving the first integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t_{r}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}\\tau}{t_{r}}\\right) d\\tau = \\left[ \\frac{t_{r}}{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}\\tau}{t_{r}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{t_{r}} = \\frac{t_{r}}{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}} (\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon_{0}) - 1)\n$$\nSolving the second integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t_{r}} \\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{1}} + \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{r}}\\right)\\tau\\right) d\\tau = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{1}} + \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{r}}} \\exp\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{1}} + \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{r}}\\right)\\tau\\right) \\right]_{0}^{t_{r}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{1}} + \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{r}}} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{t_{r}}{\\tau_{1}} + \\beta\\epsilon_{0}\\right) - 1 \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\sigma_{\\text{QLV}}(t)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{QLV}}(t) = E_{0} \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{r}} \\left[ g_{\\infty} \\frac{t_{r}}{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}(\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon_{0}) - 1) + \\frac{(1 - g_{\\infty})\\exp(-t/\\tau_{1})}{\\frac{1}{\\tau_{1}} + \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{r}}} (\\exp(\\frac{t_{r}}{\\tau_{1}} + \\beta\\epsilon_{0}) - 1) \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{QLV}}(t) = g_{\\infty} E_{0}(\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon_{0}) - 1) + E_{0}(1-g_{\\infty}) \\frac{\\beta\\epsilon_{0}/t_{r}}{1/\\tau_{1} + \\beta\\epsilon_{0}/t_{r}} (\\exp(\\beta\\epsilon_{0}+t_{r}/\\tau_{1})-1) \\exp(-t/\\tau_{1})\n$$\nThe first term is $g_{\\infty} S^{(e)}(\\epsilon_{0})$.
