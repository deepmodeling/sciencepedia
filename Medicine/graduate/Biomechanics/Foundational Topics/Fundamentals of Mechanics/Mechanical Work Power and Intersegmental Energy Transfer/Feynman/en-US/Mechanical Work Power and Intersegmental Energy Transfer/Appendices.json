            "problem": "A single-degree-of-freedom joint rotates with angular position $\\theta(t)$, angular velocity $\\omega(t) = d\\theta/dt$, and net joint moment $M(t)$. Mechanical work $W$ done at the joint over an angular displacement is defined by the line integral of the joint moment against the generalized coordinate, and instantaneous mechanical power is defined as the time rate of doing work. Consider engineering-imposed safety constraints that enforce $|M(t)| \\leq M_{\\max}$ and $|\\omega(t)| \\leq \\omega_{\\max}$ for all $t$. \n\nPart A: Starting from the definitions of mechanical work and mechanical power, derive an inequality that bounds the instantaneous joint power magnitude in terms of $M_{\\max}$ and $\\omega_{\\max}$. Briefly explain how this bound relates to intersegmental energy transfer in a multi-joint limb when biarticular muscles redistribute energy between joints.\n\nPart B: Now consider a knee extension task where the net knee moment during concentric rotation is empirically modeled as a linear torque–velocity profile\n$$\nM(\\omega) = M_0\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right)\n$$\nfor $0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_0$, with $M_0 = 120\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ and $\\omega_0 = 12\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard principles of rotational mechanics and biomechanics. The provided data are consistent and physically plausible, and the questions are specified with sufficient clarity to permit a unique solution.\n\n### Part A: Derivation of Power Bound and Conceptual Explanation\n\nThe problem defines mechanical work $W$ done by a joint moment $M$ over an angular displacement $d\\theta$ as $dW = M d\\theta$. Instantaneous mechanical power $P$ is the time rate of doing work, so we can write:\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{dW}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int M(\\theta(t)) \\, d\\theta = M(\\theta(t)) \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\n$$\nGiven that angular velocity is defined as $\\omega(t) = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$, the expression for instantaneous joint power simplifies to:\n$$\nP(t) = M(t)\\omega(t)\n$$\nWe are asked to find an inequality for the magnitude of the joint power, $|P(t)|$. Using the properties of absolute values:\n$$\n|P(t)| = |M(t)\\omega(t)| = |M(t)||\\omega(t)|\n$$\nThe problem states engineering-imposed safety constraints such that $|M(t)| \\leq M_{\\max}$ and $|\\omega(t)| \\leq \\omega_{\\max}$ for all time $t$. Applying these inequalities to the expression for power magnitude, we obtain:\n$$\n|P(t)| \\leq M_{\\max}\\omega_{\\max}\n$$\nThis inequality provides an upper bound on the magnitude of the instantaneous power that can be generated (concentric contraction, $P  0$) or absorbed (eccentric contraction, $P  0$) at the joint.\n\nThis bound relates to intersegmental energy transfer, which is a mechanism often mediated by biarticular muscles that cross two joints (e.g., the rectus femoris crossing the hip and knee). Such a muscle can perform concentric work at one joint while simultaneously undergoing eccentric work at the other. This action results in a transfer of mechanical energy from one body segment to another. For example, energy generated at the hip could be transferred to and expressed at the knee. The rate of this energy transfer is limited by the power characteristics of the joints involved. The bound $M_{\\max}\\omega_{\\max}$ establishes the maximum rate at which a single joint can either contribute to or receive energy from such a transfer. Therefore, it represents a fundamental limit on the speed and magnitude of energy redistribution within a multi-joint limb.\n\n### Part B: Computation of Peak Instantaneous Power\n\nFor Part B, we are given an empirical model for the net joint moment $M$ as a function of angular velocity $\\omega$ during a concentric knee extension ($ \\omega \\geq 0$):\n$$\nM(\\omega) = M_0\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right)\n$$\nwith constants $M_0 = 120\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ and $\\omega_0 = 12\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$. This model is valid for $0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_0$. The instantaneous power as a function of angular velocity is:\n$$\nP(\\omega) = M(\\omega)\\omega = M_0\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right)\\omega = M_0\\left(\\omega - \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_0}\\right)\n$$\nThis power function must be maximized subject to a set of constraints:\n1.  The model's own domain: $0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_0 = 12\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n2.  The allowable angular velocity: $\\omega \\leq \\omega_{\\mathrm{allow}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n3.  The allowable joint moment: The effective moment cannot exceed $M_{\\mathrm{allow}} = 90\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\n\nLet's analyze the third constraint. The model predicts a moment $M(\\omega) = 120(1 - \\omega/12)$. We must enforce $M(\\omega) \\leq 90\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\n$$\n120\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{12}\\right) \\leq 90\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\omega}{12} \\leq \\frac{90}{120} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} \\leq \\frac{\\omega}{12}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega \\geq \\frac{12}{4} = 3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nThis means that for angular velocities $\\omega  3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$, the theoretical moment from the model exceeds the allowable moment. The problem states that the *effective* joint moment cannot exceed $M_{\\mathrm{allow}}$. This implies the torque-velocity profile is capped. The effective moment, $M_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$, is therefore a piecewise function:\n$$\nM_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} M_{\\mathrm{allow}}  \\text{if } M(\\omega)  M_{\\mathrm{allow}} \\\\ M(\\omega)  \\text{if } M(\\omega) \\leq M_{\\mathrm{allow}} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis translates to:\n$$\nM_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} 90\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}  \\text{if } \\omega  3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} \\\\ 120\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{12}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}  \\text{if } \\omega \\geq 3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe search for the peak power is also limited by the velocity constraint $\\omega \\leq \\omega_{\\mathrm{allow}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$. Thus, the full domain for our analysis is $0 \\leq \\omega \\leq 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n\nThe corresponding effective power function, $P_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = M_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)\\omega$, is also piecewise:\n$$\nP_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} 90\\omega  \\text{for } 0 \\leq \\omega  3 \\\\ 120\\left(\\omega - \\frac{\\omega^2}{12}\\right)  \\text{for } 3 \\leq \\omega \\leq 7 \\end{cases}\n$$\nWe must find the maximum of $P_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$ on the interval $[0, 7]$. We analyze each piece separately.\n\nCase 1: $0 \\leq \\omega  3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\nThe power function is $P_1(\\omega) = 90\\omega$. This is a linearly increasing function. Its maximum value on this interval occurs as $\\omega$ approaches its upper bound.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\omega \\to 3^-} P_1(\\omega) = 90 \\times 3 = 270\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $3 \\leq \\omega \\leq 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\nThe power function is $P_2(\\omega) = 120(\\omega - \\omega^2/12)$. This is a quadratic function representing a downward-opening parabola. To find its maximum, we take the derivative with respect to $\\omega$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dP_2}{d\\omega} = 120\\left(1 - \\frac{2\\omega}{12}\\right) = 120\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{6}\\right)\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero: $1 - \\frac{\\omega}{6} = 0 \\implies \\omega = 6\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\nThis value $\\omega = 6\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ lies within the interval for this case, $[3, 7]$. Since the parabola opens downwards, this is the location of the maximum for this piece. We calculate the power at this velocity:\n$$\nP_2(6) = 120\\left(6 - \\frac{6^2}{12}\\right) = 120\\left(6 - \\frac{36}{12}\\right) = 120(6-3) = 120(3) = 360\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\n\nComparing the maximum power from both regions, we have $270\\,\\mathrm{W}$ from the first piece and $360\\,\\mathrm{W}$ from the second. The theoretical peak instantaneous joint power under all constraints is the greater of these two values.\n$$\nP_{\\text{peak}} = \\max(270\\,\\mathrm{W}, 360\\,\\mathrm{W}) = 360\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nAt this peak power, the operating point is $\\omega = 6\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $M = M(6) = 120(1 - 6/12) = 60\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$. Both values are within the allowable limits ($\\omega \\leq 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $M \\leq 90\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$).\n\nThe problem requests the answer rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $360\\,\\mathrm{W}$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $360.0\\,\\mathrm{W}$.",

The concepts of joint moment, angular velocity, joint power ($P = M \\cdot \\omega$), mechanical work ($W = \\int P dt$), and the use of Ground Reaction Forces for gait event detection are all standard, well-established concepts. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of inputs (time-series data) and asks for a specific set of outputs (positive and negative work for stance and swing). The question requires the evaluation of a *procedure*, for which a correct answer, based on established biomechanical methods, can be determined.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem uses precise, objective, technical language common to the field of biomechanics. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The information provided is sufficient and internally consistent. It describes a standard experimental setup for gait analysis and correctly characterizes the nature of the signals (e.g., GRF is non-zero during stance; toe clears the ground during swing). The assumptions listed are standard for this type of analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formed question in the field of biomechanics that tests knowledge of standard data processing and analysis methodologies. I will proceed with the solution derivation and option analysis.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe objective is to compute the positive and negative work done at the knee joint during the stance and swing phases of a gait cycle. This multi-step process requires signal processing, phase segmentation, power calculation, and numerical integration.\n\n1.  **Joint Power Calculation:** Mechanical power ($P$) at a rotational joint is the rate of doing work, defined as the product of the joint moment ($M$) and the joint angular velocity ($\\omega$).\n    $$P_{\\text{knee}}(t) = M_{\\text{knee}}(t) \\cdot \\omega_{\\text{knee}}(t)$$\n    The joint angular velocity, $\\omega_{\\text{knee}}(t)$, must be computed from the joint angle, $\\theta_{\\text{knee}}(t)$, by temporal differentiation:\n    $$\\omega_{\\text{knee}}(t) = \\frac{d\\theta_{\\text{knee}}(t)}{dt}$$\n    Since the provided data are discrete time series, this differentiation must be performed numerically. Before differentiation, which amplifies noise, the signals $M_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ and $\\theta_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ should be low-pass filtered to remove high-frequency noise not associated with physiological movement. A zero-phase filter (e.g., a dual-pass Butterworth filter) is essential to prevent artificial time shifts between the moment and velocity signals, which would corrupt the power calculation. A cutoff frequency in the range of $5-15$ Hz is typical for human gait analysis; $6$ Hz is a common and defensible choice.\n\n2.  **Gait Phase Segmentation:** The gait cycle must be divided into stance and swing phases.\n    -   **Stance Phase:** The period when the foot is in contact with the ground.\n    -   **Swing Phase:** The period when the foot is not in contact with the ground.\n    The most direct and robust method to determine ground contact is by analyzing the Ground Reaction Force ($F_z(t)$). The stance phase begins at heel-strike and ends at toe-off.\n    -   **Heel-Strike ($t_{hs}$):** The instant when the foot makes contact with the ground, identified as the time when $F_z(t)$ rises above a small, non-zero threshold ($T$). Using a threshold (e.g., $T \\approx 10-50$ N) is crucial to distinguish true ground contact from baseline noise in the force platform signal.\n    -   **Toe-Off ($t_{to}$):** The instant when the foot leaves the ground, identified as the time when $F_z(t)$ falls below the same threshold $T$.\n    The stance phase is the interval $[t_{hs}, t_{to}]$. The swing phase is the interval $(t_{to}, t_{1}]$, where $t_1$ is the subsequent heel-strike of the same foot. The kinematic marker data, such as the peak of $y_{\\text{toe}}(t)$, is useful for identifying sub-events within swing (e.g., mid-swing) but is not the primary determinant for the stance-swing boundary.\n\n3.  **Work Calculation:** Mechanical work ($W$) is the time integral of power. We must distinguish between positive (generative) work and negative (absorptive) work.\n    -   **Positive Work ($W^{+}$):** Occurs when power is positive ($P(t)  0$), meaning the net joint moment acts in the same direction as the joint's angular motion. This represents a net generation of energy at the joint, which is delivered to the surrounding segments.\n    $$W^{+} = \\int_{P(t)  0} P(t) dt$$\n    -   **Negative Work ($W^{-}$):** Occurs when power is negative ($P(t)  0$), meaning the net joint moment opposes the joint's angular motion. This represents a net absorption of energy from the segments by the joint structures.\n    $$W^{-} = \\int_{P(t)  0} P(t) dt$$\n    It is conventional to report the magnitude of absorbed energy, so one might compute $|W^{-}|$. The problem statement refers to \"negated integral over subintervals with $P(t)  0$,\" which also yields a positive value.\n    These integrals are computed numerically over the discrete time series for each phase (stance and swing). A method like the trapezoidal rule is used. To accurately handle intervals where power changes sign, it is best practice to identify the zero-crossing points (e.g., via linear interpolation between samples) and split the integration interval at these points. This ensures that positive and negative areas under the power curve do not artifactually cancel within a single sampling step.\n\n4.  **Interpretation:** The calculated net joint work includes contributions from active muscle-tendon units and energy transfer between adjacent segments (intersegmental energy transfer). It is a net quantity at the joint level, not a direct measure of metabolic cost or the work of individual muscles.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Low-pass filter $M_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ and $\\theta_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ with a zero-phase Butterworth filter at cutoff $6$ Hz, compute angular velocity $\\omega_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ by differentiating $\\theta_{\\text{knee}}(t)$, and compute joint power $P_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ as the product $M_{\\text{knee}}(t)\\,\\omega_{\\text{knee}}(t)$. Define stance as the interval where $F_{z}(t)  T$ with threshold $T = 50$ N, using the upward crossing of $F_{z}(t) = T$ as heel-strike and the downward crossing as toe-off; define swing as the complement. Refine the swing segmentation by locating mid-swing via the maximum of $y_{\\text{toe}}(t)$ to separate early and late swing if needed but keep stance and swing disjoint. Within each phase, compute positive work $W^{+}$ by integrating $P_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ only over subintervals with $P_{\\text{knee}}(t)  0$, and negative work $W^{-}$ as the negated integral over subintervals with $P_{\\text{knee}}(t)  0$, using trapezoidal integration on sign-consistent subintervals and linear interpolation to identify exact zero-crossing times when $P_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ changes sign inside a sample step. Justify the stance–swing segmentation by the contact mechanics captured in $F_{z}(t)$ and the kinematic event $y_{\\text{toe}}(t)$ for intra-swing refinement, and interpret $P_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ as reflecting both muscle-tendon work and intersegmental energy transfer, with $W^{+}$ and $W^{-}$ representing net generative and absorptive work at the joint within each phase.**\n\nThis option comprehensively and correctly describes the standard, state-of-the-art procedure.\n-   **Signal Processing:** Correct filter type, phase characteristic, and a reasonable cutoff frequency are specified.\n-   **Power Calculation:** The definition $P = M\\omega$ is correctly stated.\n-   **Segmentation:** The use of a thresholded $F_z(t)$ signal is the gold standard for defining stance and swing. The threshold value $T=50$ N is appropriate.\n-   **Work Calculation:** The definitions of $W^+$ and $W^-$ are correct, and the numerical integration method described (trapezoidal rule with handling of zero-crossings) is robust.\n-   **Interpretation:** The justification for segmentation and the interpretation of joint power are accurate and show a sophisticated understanding of the underlying biomechanics.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Segment the gait phases using the sign of knee angular velocity: define stance when $\\omega_{\\text{knee}}(t)  0$ and swing when $\\omega_{\\text{knee}}(t)  0$.

Ignore GRF and kinematic events, as they are unnecessary if joint-level signals are available.**\n\nThis option contains multiple fundamental errors.\n-   **Segmentation:** The sign of $\\omega_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ does not define stance vs. swing. The knee flexes ($\\omega_{\\text{knee}}  0$ by some conventions) in early stance and extends ($\\omega_{\\text{knee}}  0$) in late swing. This criterion is invalid.\n-   **Work Calculation:** Work is the integral of power ($P=M\\omega$), not the integral of moment ($M$). The sign of work depends on the product of the signs of $M$ and $\\omega$. Ignoring $\\omega$ in determining the sign of work is a critical conceptual error.\n-   **Justification:** The premise that the sign of $M_{\\text{knee}}(t)$ alone determines energy generation/absorption is false.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use $F_{z}(t)$ to detect stance as $F_{z}(t) \\ge 0$, treat swing as the complement, and compute total mechanical work over the entire gait cycle by integrating the magnitude $|P_{\\text{knee}}(t)|$; classify the total as positive work because negative work is merely energy transfer to passive tissues and does not represent mechanical work. Kinematic events like toe marker extrema are not useful for segmentation because they do not correspond to work production.**\n\nThis option is methodologically and conceptually flawed.\n-   **Work Calculation:** The problem asks for positive and negative work separately for each phase. This option computes a single quantity, $\\int |P_{\\text{knee}}(t)| dt$, which represents total energy turnover, not separate generative and absorptive work.\n-   **Interpretation:** The claim that negative work is not mechanical work is false. Negative work (energy absorption) is mechanically and physiologically critical. Eccentric muscle contractions perform negative work to decelerate limbs and absorb shock.\n-   **Segmentation:** Using a threshold of $F_z(t) \\ge 0$ is less robust than using a small positive threshold due to signal noise. Also, the problem asks for work per phase, but this option frames the calculation over the \"entire gait cycle\".\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Estimate knee joint work indirectly from segment mechanical energy changes by computing the change in the shank’s kinetic plus potential energy between $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}$ and attributing it to knee joint work. Use $y_{\\text{toe}}(t)$ minima to mark stance and maxima to mark swing, and assume negative work is zero during swing because external forces are negligible, while positive work occurs only during stance when $F_{z}(t)$ is nonzero. Compute work without distinguishing sign changes within phases to avoid oversegmentation.**\n\nThis option is based on an incorrect application of the work-energy principle and faulty assumptions.\n-   **Work Estimation:** The change in a segment's energy is equal to the net work done by *all* forces and moments acting on it. The change in shank energy is caused by work done at both the knee and ankle joints, plus work done by gravity. Attributing this entire change to the knee joint is a major error.\n-   **Segmentation:** Using $y_{\\text{toe}}(t)$ minima and maxima to define stance and swing boundaries is incorrect. These kinematic events occur within phases, not at their boundaries.\n-   **Assumptions:** The assumption that negative work is zero during swing is false. Significant negative work is performed at the knee in late swing to decelerate the shank.\n-   **Work Calculation:** The instruction to compute work without distinguishing sign changes contradicts the problem's explicit requirement to compute positive and negative work separately.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

Report the numerical values.\n3) Based on your derivation and computations, select the statement that most accurately distinguishes “individual limb external work” from “whole-body external work” and explains the implications for interlimb asymmetry analysis in steady, level locomotion.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Individual limb external work is the time integral of that limb’s GRF dotted with the COM velocity, while whole-body external work is the time integral of the net external force (sum of limb GRFs and other external forces such as gravity) dotted with the COM velocity. Consequently, whole-body external work can be $0$ in steady gait even when limb-specific external works are nonzero and asymmetric; therefore, asymmetry analysis should use limb-resolved external work rather than whole-body COM external work alone.\n\nB. Individual limb external work equals the time integral of that limb’s GRF dotted with the foot velocity during stance, and whole-body external work equals the sum of the limb external works. Therefore, identical foot speeds during stance guarantee symmetry of limb external work even if the GRFs differ.\n\nC. Individual limb external work is the change in that limb’s segmental kinetic plus potential energy, whereas whole-body external work is the change in COM energy. Thus, if whole-body external work is $0$ under steady-speed, level walking, each limb’s external work must be $0$, and asymmetry cannot exist.\n\nD. Whole-body external work equals the algebraic sum of positive work from the propulsive limb only, because braking work cancels within the limb and does not affect the COM. Therefore, asymmetry should be quantified solely by the net positive work of the dominant limb.",

The values are within a realistic range for human locomotion.\n\n2.  **Internal Consistency:** We must verify if the given forces are consistent with the given motion according to Newton's Second Law for the whole-body COM.\n    The law states: $\\sum \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{ext}} = m \\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{COM}}$.\n    The external forces acting on the body are the two GRFs ($\\mathbf{F}_{L}$, $\\mathbf{F}_{R}$) and the force of gravity ($\\mathbf{F}_{g}$).\n    The force of gravity is $\\mathbf{F}_{g} = (0, -mg) = (0, -686.7)\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n\n    Let's compute the GRF vectors with the given values:\n    - $\\mathbf{F}_{L} = (-50, 0.6 \\times 686.7)\\,\\mathrm{N} = (-50, 412.02)\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n    - $\\mathbf{F}_{R} = (+50, 0.4 \\times 686.7)\\,\\mathrm{N} = (+50, 274.68)\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n\n    The net external force $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}}$ is the vector sum of all external forces:\n    $$ \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\mathbf{F}_{L} + \\mathbf{F}_{R} + \\mathbf{F}_{g} $$\n    $$ \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = (-50 + 50, \\,\\, 412.02 + 274.68 - 686.7)\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\n    $$ \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = (0, \\,\\, 686.7 - 686.7)\\,\\mathrm{N} = (0, 0)\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\n    So, the net external force is the zero vector, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n    According to Newton's Second Law, the acceleration of the COM is:\n    $$ \\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}}}{m} = \\frac{\\mathbf{0}}{70\\,\\mathrm{kg}} = \\mathbf{0} $$\n    The problem states that the COM velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}}$ is constant. If velocity is constant, then its time derivative, the acceleration $\\mathbf{a}_{\\mathrm{COM}}$, must be zero.\n    This confirms that the given forces are perfectly consistent with the described motion. The problem is internally consistent.\n\n3.  **Well-Posedness and Objectivity:** The problem asks for specific derivations, calculations, and a conceptual choice based on those results. It is phrased using precise, objective language and has a clear, solvable structure.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, internally consistent, and well-posed. The validation is successful. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivations and Computations\n\n**1) Derive Expressions for Power**\n\nThe instantaneous power $P$ delivered by a force $\\mathbf{F}$ is given by the dot product of the force and the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ of the point of application of the force, $P = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$. However, the problem specifies the context of the work-energy theorem *for the COM*. This theorem states that the rate of change of the COM's kinetic energy ($K_{\\text{COM}} = \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\text{COM}}^2$) is equal to the dot product of the *net external force* and the *COM velocity*.\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}K_{\\text{COM}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{COM}} $$\nThis quantity, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{COM}}$, is defined as the whole-body external power delivered to the COM.\n\n-   **Instantaneous external power delivered to the COM by a single limb:**\n    Within this framework, the contribution of a single external force, such as the GRF from one limb ($\\mathbf{F}_{i}$), to the total power delivered to the COM is defined as the dot product of that force with the COM velocity. This is a standard convention in COM-based gait analysis.\n    Therefore, the instantaneous external power delivered to the COM by a single limb $i$ from its GRF $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$ is:\n    $$ P_{i} = \\mathbf{F}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} $$\n\n-   **Whole-body external power delivered to the COM:**\n    This is the sum of the power contributions from all external forces. The external forces are $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$, $\\mathbf{F}_{R}$, and $\\mathbf{F}_{g}$.\n    $$ P_{\\text{whole-body}} = (\\mathbf{F}_{L} + \\mathbf{F}_{R} + \\mathbf{F}_{g}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} $$\n    Since $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\mathbf{F}_{L} + \\mathbf{F}_{R} + \\mathbf{F}_{g}$, this is equivalent to:\n    $$ P_{\\text{whole-body}} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} $$\n\n**2) Compute External Work Over the Interval**\n\nWork $W$ is the time integral of power $P$. Since all forces and the COM velocity are constant over the interval $\\Delta t = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$, the power is also constant. Thus, work is simply $W = P \\cdot \\Delta t$.\n\n-   **Individual limb external work for the left limb ($W_L$):**\n    $$ W_L = (\\mathbf{F}_{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}}) \\Delta t $$\n    Using the given values:\n    $\\mathbf{F}_{L} = (-50, 412.02)\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n    $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = (1.2, 0.05)\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n    $$ \\mathbf{F}_{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = (-50)(1.2) + (412.02)(0.05) = -60 + 20.601 = -39.399\\,\\mathrm{W} $$\n    $$ W_L = (-39.399\\,\\mathrm{W}) (0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}) = -7.8798\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\n\n-   **Individual limb external work for the right limb ($W_R$):**\n    $$ W_R = (\\mathbf{F}_{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}}) \\Delta t $$\n    Using the given values:\n    $\\mathbf{F}_{R} = (+50, 274.68)\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n    $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = (1.2, 0.05)\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n    $$ \\mathbf{F}_{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = (50)(1.2) + (274.68)(0.05) = 60 + 13.734 = 73.734\\,\\mathrm{W} $$\n    $$ W_R = (73.734\\,\\mathrm{W}) (0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 14.7468\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\n\n-   **Whole-body external work ($W_{\\text{whole-body}}$):**\n    $$ W_{\\text{whole-body}} = (\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}}) \\Delta t $$\n    As shown in the validation, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n    $$ W_{\\text{whole-body}} = (\\mathbf{0} \\cdot (1.2, 0.05)\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) (0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}) = (0\\,\\mathrm{W})(0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 0\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\n    This result is also directly given by the work-energy theorem for the COM: $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = \\Delta K_{\\text{COM}}$. Since $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}}$ is constant, the change in COM kinetic energy, $\\Delta K_{\\text{COM}}$, is zero. Therefore, $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n\n**Numerical Summary:**\n-   $W_L \\approx -7.88\\,\\mathrm{J}$ (negative work, often called `braking`)\n-   $W_R \\approx 14.75\\,\\mathrm{J}$ (positive work, often called `propulsion`)\n-   $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n\n**3) Analysis of Options**\n\nBased on the derivations and calculations, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. Individual limb external work is the time integral of that limb’s GRF dotted with the COM velocity, while whole-body external work is the time integral of the net external force (sum of limb GRFs and other external forces such as gravity) dotted with the COM velocity. Consequently, whole-body external work can be $0$ in steady gait even when limb-specific external works are nonzero and asymmetric; therefore, asymmetry analysis should use limb-resolved external work rather than whole-body COM external work alone.**\n-   The definitions of individual limb work and whole-body work match our derivations perfectly.\n-   The consequence that whole-body work can be zero ($W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$) while limb-specific works are non-zero and asymmetric ($W_L \\approx -7.88\\,\\mathrm{J}$, $W_R \\approx 14.75\\,\\mathrm{J}$) is directly demonstrated by our calculations.\n-   The final conclusion that asymmetry analysis requires examining limb-resolved work is a sound and logical implication, as the whole-body metric ($0\\,\\mathrm{J}$) completely masks the substantial asymmetry between the left and right limbs' contributions.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Individual limb external work equals the time integral of that limb’s GRF dotted with the foot velocity during stance, and whole-body external work equals the sum of the limb external works. Therefore, identical foot speeds during stance guarantee symmetry of limb external work even if the GRFs differ.**\n-   The definition provided for individual limb external work is $\\int \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{foot}} \\mathrm{d}t$. Since the feet do not slip, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{foot}} = \\mathbf{0}$. This would mean limb external work is always zero, which contradicts our calculation based on the COM work-energy theorem ($W_L \\neq 0, W_R \\neq 0$). This is the work done *at the point of force application*, not the work done *on the COM*.\n-   The statement that whole-body external work is the sum of limb external works is also false. $W_L + W_R = -7.88 + 14.75 = 6.87\\,\\mathrm{J}$, which is not equal to $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$. This sum omits the work done by gravity.\n-   The final conclusion is based on a false premise and is itself false. Foot speeds are identically zero, yet the limb works are asymmetric.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Individual limb external work is the change in that limb’s segmental kinetic plus potential energy, whereas whole-body external work is the change in COM energy. Thus, if whole-body external work is $0$ under steady-speed, level walking, each limb’s external work must be $0$, and asymmetry cannot exist.**\n-   The definition of individual limb external work is incorrect in the context of COM analysis. It describes the work-energy relationship for a limb segment, not the contribution of the limb's external force to the whole-body COM energy.\n-   The definition of whole-body external work as the \"change in COM energy\" is ambiguous. The work done by all external forces (including conservative ones like gravity) equals the change in *kinetic* energy of the COM ($W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta K_{\\text{COM}}$). The work done by *non-conservative* external forces equals the change in *total* energy of the COM ($W_{\\text{nc}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{COM}} = \\Delta K_{\\text{COM}} + \\Delta U_{\\text{COM}}$). The statement is imprecise.\n-   The conclusion that if whole-body work is zero, then each limb's work must also be zero is directly contradicted by our calculations ($W_{\\text{whole-body}}=0\\,\\mathrm{J}$, but $W_L \\neq 0$ and $W_R \\neq 0$).\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Whole-body external work equals the algebraic sum of positive work from the propulsive limb only, because braking work cancels within the limb and does not affect the COM. Therefore, asymmetry should be quantified solely by the net positive work of the dominant limb.**\n-   The first clause is false. Our calculation showed $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$, while the positive work from the right (propulsive) limb was $W_R = 14.75\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n-   The reasoning that \"braking work cancels within the limb\" is mechanistically false. The braking GRF is an external force that performs negative work on the COM, directly affecting its motion and energy. The work is $W_L = -7.88\\,\\mathrm{J}$, which is not cancelled. It is a transfer of energy from the COM to the body's internal state.\n-   The conclusion to quantify asymmetry by only one limb's contribution is an oversimplification that ignores the crucial information provided by the other limb.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
