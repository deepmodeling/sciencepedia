            "problem": "A rigid forearm–hand segment is modeled in the sagittal plane as a single link hinged at the elbow. The forearm is held static and exactly horizontal. A person holds a dumbbell in the hand, creating a known external load. The only muscle considered is the biceps brachii, modeled as a tensile force applied at its insertion on the forearm. The elbow joint transmits an unknown resultant reaction force at the joint center. Neglect all other muscles and ligamentous forces, and neglect friction at the joint.\n\nKnown geometric and inertial data:\n- Distance from elbow joint center to the dumbbell’s line of action: $0.35\\,\\text{m}$.\n- Distance from elbow joint center to the forearm–hand center of mass (center of mass (COM)): $0.15\\,\\text{m}$.\n- Distance from elbow joint center to the biceps insertion: $0.040\\,\\text{m}$.\n- The biceps line of action makes a constant angle of $15^{\\circ}$ with the forearm axis (measured in the sagittal plane).\n- Mass of the dumbbell: $6.0\\,\\text{kg}$.\n- Mass of the forearm–hand segment: $1.8\\,\\text{kg}$.\n- Gravitational acceleration: $9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The forearm–hand is a rigid body in static equilibrium in the sagittal plane.\n- The elbow joint reaction acts at the joint center and produces no moment about that point.\n- The biceps force acts along its line of action; its magnitude is unknown.\n- The dumbbell and the segment weight act vertically downward.\n\nTask:\n- Starting from Newton’s laws for a rigid body in static equilibrium in a plane, select and justify a point about which to write the scalar moment balance so as to eliminate one unknown. Then use the full set of equilibrium equations to solve for the unknown biceps muscle force magnitude and the elbow joint reaction (components or magnitude). \n\nReport only the magnitude of the biceps muscle force required to maintain static equilibrium for the forearm–hand system as specified. Express your final answer in newtons (N) and round to four significant figures. Angles are measured in degrees.",
            "solution": "The problem requires finding the magnitude of the biceps muscle force needed to keep a forearm-hand segment in static equilibrium under specific loading conditions. The analysis is based on the principles of Newtonian mechanics for a rigid body in a two-dimensional plane. A body is in static equilibrium if the vector sum of all external forces acting on it is zero, and the sum of the moments of those forces about any point is zero.\n\nThe equilibrium conditions are expressed mathematically as:\n$$ \\sum \\vec{F} = \\vec{0} $$\n$$ \\sum \\vec{M} = \\vec{0} $$\n\nFor a planar problem in the $xy$-plane, these vector equations resolve into three scalar equations:\n$$ \\sum F_x = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum F_y = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum M_z = 0 $$\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system with the origin at the elbow joint center. The $x$-axis is aligned with the horizontal forearm, pointing away from the elbow, and the $y$-axis points vertically upward.\n\nThe forces acting on the forearm–hand segment are:\n$1$. The weight of the forearm–hand segment, $\\vec{W}_F$, acting vertically downward at a distance $d_F = 0.15\\,\\text{m}$ from the elbow. Its magnitude is $W_F = m_F g$, where $m_F = 1.8\\,\\text{kg}$ and $g = 9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$.\n$2$. The weight of the dumbbell, $\\vec{W}_D$, acting vertically downward at a distance $d_D = 0.35\\,\\text{m}$ from the elbow. Its magnitude is $W_D = m_D g$, where $m_D = 6.0\\,\\text{kg}$.\n$3$. The tensile force from the biceps muscle, $\\vec{F}_B$, acting at the insertion point, a distance $d_B = 0.040\\,\\text{m}$ from the elbow. The magnitude of this force is $F_B$, and its line of action makes an angle $\\theta = 15^{\\circ}$ with the forearm. This force generates both a vertical (lifting) component and a horizontal (compressive) component.\n$4$. The elbow joint reaction force, $\\vec{R}$, acting at the joint center (the origin). This force has two unknown components, a horizontal component $R_x$ and a vertical component $R_y$.\n\nThe problem requires the justification for selecting a point about which to write the moment balance equation to eliminate an unknown. The most strategic point to choose for calculating the moments is the elbow joint center. The justification is that the joint reaction force $\\vec{R}$ passes through this point. By definition, the moment of a force about a point on its line of action is zero, because the lever arm is zero. Therefore, choosing the elbow joint as the pivot point eliminates the two unknown components of the reaction force, $R_x$ and $R_y$, from the moment equation. This leaves an equation with only one unknown, the magnitude of the biceps force $F_B$, which can then be solved for directly.\n\nThe scalar moment equilibrium equation about the elbow joint is $\\sum M_{\\text{elbow}} = 0$. By convention, counter-clockwise moments are positive and clockwise moments are negative.\n\nThe vertical component of the biceps force, $F_B \\sin\\theta$, creates a counter-clockwise (positive) moment about the elbow. The lever arm is the distance from the elbow to the biceps insertion, $d_B$.\nMoment from biceps: $M_B = (F_B \\sin\\theta) \\cdot d_B$.\n\nThe weights of the forearm–hand segment and the dumbbell act downward, creating clockwise (negative) moments.\nMoment from forearm weight: $M_F = -W_F \\cdot d_F = -m_F g d_F$.\nMoment from dumbbell weight: $M_D = -W_D \\cdot d_D = -m_D g d_D$.\n\nThe moment equilibrium equation is:\n$$ \\sum M_{\\text{elbow}} = M_B + M_F + M_D = 0 $$\n$$ (F_B \\sin\\theta) d_B - m_F g d_F - m_D g d_D = 0 $$\n\nWe can now solve for the unknown biceps force magnitude, $F_B$:\n$$ (F_B \\sin\\theta) d_B = m_F g d_F + m_D g d_D $$\n$$ F_B = \\frac{g (m_F d_F + m_D d_D)}{d_B \\sin\\theta} $$\n\nNow, substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n- $g = 9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$\n- $m_F = 1.8\\,\\text{kg}$\n- $d_F = 0.15\\,\\text{m}$\n- $m_D = 6.0\\,\\text{kg}$\n- $d_D = 0.35\\,\\text{m}$\n- $d_B = 0.040\\,\\text{m}$\n- $\\theta = 15^{\\circ}$\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator term $g (m_F d_F + m_D d_D)$:\n$$ m_F d_F = (1.8\\,\\text{kg})(0.15\\,\\text{m}) = 0.27\\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m} $$\n$$ m_D d_D = (6.0\\,\\text{kg})(0.35\\,\\text{m}) = 2.1\\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m} $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}) (0.27\\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m} + 2.1\\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}) = (9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}) (2.37\\,\\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}) = 23.2497\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m} $$\n\nNext, calculate the denominator term $d_B \\sin\\theta$:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = (0.040\\,\\text{m}) \\sin(15^{\\circ}) \\approx (0.040\\,\\text{m})(0.258819) \\approx 0.01035276\\,\\text{m} $$\n\nFinally, calculate $F_B$:\n$$ F_B = \\frac{23.2497\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}}{0.01035276\\,\\text{m}} \\approx 2245.7405\\,\\text{N} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ F_B \\approx 2246\\,\\text{N} $$\n\nAlthough not required for the final answer, the elbow joint reaction force components could be subsequently determined using the force equilibrium equations, $\\sum F_x = 0$ and $\\sum F_y = 0$, now that $F_B$ is known.",

This implies that no muscle force can be zero ($F_i > 0$ for all active muscles). Thus, all $\\mu_i = 0$.\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that all muscle force bounds are inactive ($0 < F_i < F_i^{\\max}$). In this case, $\\mu_i=\\nu_i=0$ for all $i$. The forces are given by $F_i = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} r_i (F_i^{\\max})^2$. Substituting these into the equality constraint:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{3} r_i \\left( -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} r_i (F_i^{\\max})^2 \\right) = M_{\\mathrm{req}} \\implies -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} r_i^2 (F_i^{\\max})^2 = M_{\\mathrm{req}}\n$$\nLet's compute the sum $S = \\sum_{i=1}^3 r_i^2 (F_i^{\\max})^2$:\n$r_1^2 (F_1^{\\max})^2 = (0.03)^2 (1500)^2 = 2025 \\text{ N}^2\\text{m}^2$\n$r_2^2 (F_2^{\\max})^2 = (0.02)^2 (800)^2 = 256 \\text{ N}^2\\text{m}^2$\n$r_3^2 (F_3^{\\max})^2 = (0.01)^2 (400)^2 = 16 \\text{ N}^2\\text{m}^2$\n$S = 2025 + 256 + 16 = 2297 \\text{ N}^2\\text{m}^2$.\n\nFrom this, we solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\frac{2 M_{\\mathrm{req}}}{S} = -\\frac{2(60)}{2297} = -\\frac{120}{2297}\n$$\nNow we compute the forces based on this $\\lambda$:\n$F_1 = -\\frac{(-120/2297)}{2} (0.03)(1500)^2 = \\frac{60}{2297}(67500) \\approx 1763.17 \\text{ N}$\n$F_2 = -\\frac{(-120/2297)}{2} (0.02)(800)^2 = \\frac{60}{2297}(12800) \\approx 334.35 \\text{ N}$\n$F_3 = -\\frac{(-120/2297)}{2} (0.01)(400)^2 = \\frac{60}{2297}(1600) \\approx 41.79 \\text{ N}$\n\nWe check these forces against their bounds: $F_1^{\\max} = 1500 \\text{ N}$, $F_2^{\\max} = 800 \\text{ N}$, $F_3^{\\max} = 400 \\text{ N}$.\nThe calculated force $F_1 \\approx 1763.17 \\text{ N}$ violates its upper bound $F_1 > F_1^{\\max}$. Thus, our initial hypothesis is false. Muscle $F_1$ must be saturated at its maximum force.\n\nLet's formulate a new hypothesis: Muscle 1 is at its upper bound ($F_1 = F_1^{\\max}$), while muscles 2 and 3 have inactive bounds ($0 < F_2 < F_2^{\\max}$ and $0 < F_3 < F_3^{\\max}$).\nFor $F_1 = F_1^{\\max} = 1500 \\text{ N}$, the upper bound constraint is active, so $\\nu_1 \\ge 0$.\nFor $F_2$ and $F_3$, the bounds are inactive, so $\\nu_2 = \\nu_3 = 0$. Since all forces will be positive, $\\mu_i=0$ for all $i$.\n\nThe equality constraint is: $r_1 F_1^{\\max} + r_2 F_2 + r_3 F_3 = M_{\\mathrm{req}}$.\nThe forces for the inactive muscles are still $F_i = -\\frac{\\lambda r_i (F_i^{\\max})^2}{2}$ for $i=2,3$.\nSubstituting these into the equality constraint:\n$$\nr_1 F_1^{\\max} + r_2 \\left(-\\frac{\\lambda r_2 (F_2^{\\max})^2}{2}\\right) + r_3 \\left(-\\frac{\\lambda r_3 (F_3^{\\max})^2}{2}\\right) = M_{\\mathrm{req}}\n$$\n$$\nr_1 F_1^{\\max} - \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\left[ r_2^2 (F_2^{\\max})^2 + r_3^2 (F_3^{\\max})^2 \\right] = M_{\\mathrm{req}}\n$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{2(r_1 F_1^{\\max} - M_{\\mathrm{req}})}{r_2^2 (F_2^{\\max})^2 + r_3^2 (F_3^{\\max})^2}\n$$\nPlugging in the numerical values:\n$r_1 F_1^{\\max} = 0.03 \\times 1500 = 45 \\text{ N·m}$.\n$M_{\\mathrm{req}} = 60 \\text{ N·m}$.\n$r_2^2 (F_2^{\\max})^2 + r_3^2 (F_3^{\\max})^2 = 256 + 16 = 272 \\text{ N}^2\\text{m}^2$.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{2(45 - 60)}{272} = \\frac{2(-15)}{272} = -\\frac{30}{272} = -\\frac{15}{136}\n$$\nThe value of $\\lambda$ is approximately $-0.11029$.\nFor this hypothesis to be valid, we must verify all KKT conditions.\n1. Check the inactive bounds for $F_2$ and $F_3$:\n$F_2 = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} r_2 (F_2^{\\max})^2 = - \\left( -\\frac{15}{136} \\right) \\frac{(0.02)(800)^2}{2} = \\frac{15}{136} \\times 6400 = \\frac{96000}{136} = \\frac{12000}{17} \\approx 705.88 \\text{ N}$.\n$F_3 = -\\frac{\\lambda}{2} r_3 (F_3^{\\max})^2 = - \\left( -\\frac{15}{136} \\right) \\frac{(0.01)(400)^2}{2} = \\frac{15}{136} \\times 800 = \\frac{12000}{136} = \\frac{1500}{17} \\approx 88.24 \\text{ N}$.\nWe check if $0 < F_2 < F_2^{\\max}$ and $0 < F_3 < F_3^{\\max}$:\n$0 < 705.88 < 800$ (True).\n$0 < 88.24 < 400$ (True).\n2. Check the active bound for $F_1$: We must verify that $\\nu_1 \\ge 0$.\n$\\nu_1 = -\\lambda r_1 - \\frac{2}{F_1^{\\max}} = - \\left(-\\frac{15}{136}\\right) (0.03) - \\frac{2}{1500} = \\frac{0.45}{136} - \\frac{2}{1500} \\approx 0.003308 - 0.001333 = 0.001975$.\nSince $\\nu_1 > 0$, the condition is satisfied.\nAll KKT conditions are met. Thus, this is the optimal solution.\n\nThe optimal forces rounded to four significant figures are:\n$F_1 = 1500 \\text{ N}$\n$F_2 = \\frac{12000}{17} \\approx 705.9 \\text{ N}$\n$F_3 = \\frac{1500}{17} \\approx 88.24 \\text{ N}$\n\nThe active-constraint indicator vector $[I_1, I_2, I_3]$ is determined as follows:\n-   For $F_1$, the upper bound $F_1 = F_1^{\\max}$ is active. So, $I_1 = 1$.\n-   For $F_2$, neither bound is active ($0 < F_2 < F_2^{\\max}$). So, $I_2 = 0$.\n-   For $F_3$, neither bound is active ($0 < F_3 < F_3^{\\max}$). So, $I_3 = 0$.\nThe indicator vector is $[1, 0, 0]$.\n\nThe final result combines these into a single row matrix.",
