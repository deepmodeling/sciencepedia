            "introduction": "The transition from a continuous analog signal to a discrete digital representation is a critical step in force platform measurement, and it is not without its challenges. This exercise tackles the phenomenon of aliasing, where high-frequency content in a signal can masquerade as a lower frequency after sampling, corrupting the data . By working through a realistic scenario involving structural vibration, you will apply the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem to predict the aliased frequency and propose a filtering strategy, developing an essential skill for ensuring data fidelity.",

            "problem": "A laboratory-grade piezoelectric force platform records the vertical ground reaction force during walking. The analog output of the transducer includes a narrowband vibration at frequency $f_{0} = 200$ Hz, excited by a structural resonance of the platform when the heel strikes the surface. This analog signal is digitized by an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) at sampling frequency $f_{s} = 300$ Hz. \n\nStarting from the definition of sampling as periodic replication of the continuous-time spectrum at integer multiples of the sampling frequency and the concept of the Nyquist frequency $f_{N} = f_{s}/2$, derive the frequency at which the $f_{0} = 200$ Hz component will appear (alias) in the discrete-time signal recorded by the force platform data acquisition system. In your derivation, reason from first principles about how sampled spectra fold into the baseband $[0, f_{N}]$ and determine the integer indexing of the spectral replicas that yields the observed aliased frequency. \n\nAdditionally, justify an analog Anti-Aliasing Filter (AAF) design choice that mitigates the aliasing in this scenario while preserving biomechanically relevant content up to $50$ Hz. Your proposal should specify a low-pass cutoff frequency relative to $f_{N}$ and an order or slope rationale that achieves strong attenuation at $f_{0} = 200$ Hz, while maintaining near-unity gain in the passband up to $50$ Hz. The filter proposal is conceptual and does not require a numerical specification as the final answer.\n\nExpress the aliased frequency in Hz. No rounding is required; report the exact value.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of digital signal processing, specifically the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem and the phenomenon of aliasing. The provided values are consistent and realistic for a biomechanics measurement scenario. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to determine a unique solution for the aliased frequency and to formulate a reasoned conceptual design for an anti-aliasing filter.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding how a continuous-time signal's frequency spectrum is transformed upon discrete-time sampling. The process of sampling an analog signal $x(t)$ at a frequency $f_s$ can be modeled as multiplying the signal by an infinite train of Dirac delta functions separated by the sampling period $T_s = 1/f_s$. In the frequency domain, this corresponds to the convolution of the signal's spectrum, $X(f)$, with a train of delta functions at integer multiples of $f_s$. The resulting spectrum of the sampled signal, $X_s(f)$, is a periodic replication of the original spectrum:\n$$X_s(f) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(f - k f_s)$$\nwhere $k$ is an integer index for the spectral replicas.\n\nThe Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and subsequent digital processing can only represent frequencies within the baseband, which extends from $0$ to the Nyquist frequency, $f_N$. The Nyquist frequency is defined as half the sampling frequency:\n$$f_N = \\frac{f_s}{2}$$\nFor the given sampling frequency of $f_s = 300$ Hz, the Nyquist frequency is:\n$$f_N = \\frac{300 \\text{ Hz}}{2} = 150 \\text{ Hz}$$\nThe baseband of the recorded signal is therefore $[0, 150]$ Hz.\n\nThe problem states that a structural resonance introduces a vibration component at a frequency of $f_0 = 200$ Hz. Since $f_0 > f_N$, this frequency component lies outside the baseband and will be subject to aliasing. Aliasing is the phenomenon where a frequency component from one of the spectral replicas ($k \\neq 0$) \"folds\" or \"aliases\" into the baseband, appearing as a lower frequency that was not present in the original signal within that range.\n\nThe aliased frequency, $f_a$, is the apparent frequency in the baseband $[0, f_N]$ that corresponds to the original out-of-band frequency $f_0$. This frequency can be determined by finding the absolute difference between $f_0$ and the nearest integer multiple of the sampling frequency $f_s$. Mathematically, we seek an integer $k$ such that the aliased frequency $f_a = |f_0 - k f_s|$ falls within the range $[0, f_N]$.\n\nLet's evaluate this for the given values, $f_0 = 200$ Hz and $f_s = 300$ Hz:\n- For the replica indexed by $k=0$, the frequency is $|200 - 0 \\times 300| = 200$ Hz, which is outside the baseband $[0, 150]$ Hz. This is the original, unaliased component.\n- For the replica indexed by $k=1$, a component of the original spectrum at $f_0$ is shifted. The new frequency locations related to this replica are $f_s \\pm f_0$. The component that folds into the baseband is at a location $|f_0-f_s|$. The aliased frequency is calculated as $f_a = |200 - 1 \\times 300| = |-100| = 100$ Hz. This value, $100$ Hz, lies within the baseband $[0, 150]$ Hz.\n- For the replica indexed by $k=2$, the calculation is $|200 - 2 \\times 300| = |-400| = 400$ Hz, which is outside the baseband.\n\nThe integer index that yields the observed aliased frequency in the principal alias range is $k=1$. The spectral component from the replica centered at $f_s=300$ Hz, specifically the lower sideband component at $f_s - f_0$, manifests within the baseband. Thus, the narrowband vibration at $f_0 = 200$ Hz will appear as a spurious component at an aliased frequency of $f_a = 100$ Hz in the digitized force platform data.\n\nTo mitigate this aliasing, an analog Anti-Aliasing Filter (AAF) must be placed before the ADC. The filter's purpose is to attenuate frequencies above the Nyquist frequency ($150$ Hz) before they can be sampled and aliased. The design must also satisfy the constraint of preserving the biomechanically relevant signal content up to $50$ Hz.\n\nA suitable AAF would be an analog low-pass filter with the following characteristics:\n1.  **Cutoff Frequency, $f_c$**: The cutoff frequency must be positioned to create a flat passband for the signal of interest while providing attenuation at the aliasing frequency. It must be greater than the highest frequency of interest, $50$ Hz, but strictly less than the Nyquist frequency, $f_N = 150$ Hz, to be effective. A practical choice for $f_c$ (the $-3$ dB point) could be approximately $f_c \\approx 100$ Hz. This choice places the cutoff well above the preserved band ($[0, 50]$ Hz) to minimize amplitude and phase distortion of the relevant biomechanical signal, while still being significantly below $f_N$ and providing a transition band to attenuate higher frequencies.\n\n2.  **Order and Slope Rationale**: The steepness of the filter's attenuation characteristic (roll-off) is critical. A first-order filter provides a slow roll-off of $-20$ dB/decade, which would offer minimal attenuation at $f_0 = 200$ Hz, only one octave above a $100$ Hz cutoff. To achieve \"strong attenuation\" as required, a higher-order filter is necessary. For example, a fourth-order Butterworth filter provides a much steeper roll-off (approaching $-80$ dB/decade in the far stopband) and has the desirable property of a maximally flat passband, ensuring the fidelity of the signal components up to $50$ Hz. An even higher order, such as a sixth- or eighth-order filter, would provide a sharper transition from passband to stopband and greater attenuation of the $200$ Hz noise, further ensuring the integrity of the collected data. The choice of a higher-order filter (e.g., fourth-order or greater) is thus justified to effectively suppress the $200$ Hz resonant frequency and prevent it from corrupting the measurement in the $0-50$ Hz band of interest.",

Consider an active rotation operator about $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ by $\\theta$, denoted as $\\mathcal{R}_{\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}(\\theta)$, that rotates vectors within the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\text{–}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ plane by angle $\\theta$ counterclockwise when viewed from $+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. When the plate frame $\\{\\mathcal{P}\\}$ is obtained by rotating the laboratory frame $\\{\\mathcal{L}\\}$ by $\\theta$ about $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}_{\\mathcal{L}}$, the components of any physical vector expressed in $\\{\\mathcal{P}\\}$ can be mapped to $\\{\\mathcal{L}\\}$ by applying the corresponding rotation matrix about $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ to the component column vector.\n\nFrom the geometric action of rotations in the plane, the rotation matrix about $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ by angle $\\theta$ (right-handed, active) is\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}_{\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}(\\theta) \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\theta & \\phantom{-}\\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis form follows from the image of the unit basis vectors under a counterclockwise rotation in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\text{–}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ plane: $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\mapsto \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\mapsto -\\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\mapsto \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n\nTherefore, the mapping from plate-frame components to laboratory-frame components is\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{L}} \\;=\\; \\mathbf{R}_{\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}}(15^{\\circ})\\,\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{P}}.\n$$\nWriting $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{P}} = \\begin{pmatrix} F_{x,\\mathcal{P}} \\\\ F_{y,\\mathcal{P}} \\\\ F_{z,\\mathcal{P}} \\end{pmatrix}$ with the given values $F_{x,\\mathcal{P}} = 100$, $F_{y,\\mathcal{P}} = 50$, $F_{z,\\mathcal{P}} = 900$ (Newtons), the laboratory anterior-posterior component is the first entry of $\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{L}}$,\n$$\nF_{x,\\mathcal{L}} \\;=\\; \\cos(15^{\\circ})\\,F_{x,\\mathcal{P}} \\;-\\; \\sin(15^{\\circ})\\,F_{y,\\mathcal{P}}.\n$$\nSubstitute the given values (angles in degrees):\n$$\nF_{x,\\mathcal{L}} \\;=\\; \\cos(15^{\\circ}) \\times 100 \\;-\\; \\sin(15^{\\circ}) \\times 50.\n$$\nCompute numerically while retaining sufficient precision before rounding:\n- $\\cos(15^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.965925826$,\n- $\\sin(15^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.258819045$.\nThus,\n$$\nF_{x,\\mathcal{L}} \\approx (0.965925826)\\times 100 \\;-\\; (0.258819045)\\times 50\n= 96.5925826 \\;-\\; 12.94095225\n= 83.65163035.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures and expressed in Newtons, the result is $83.65$ N.\n\nDiscussion of implications for aligning $F_{x}$ with the gait direction:\n- Because the plate frame is rotated by $\\theta = 15^{\\circ}$, the laboratory anterior-posterior component $F_{x,\\mathcal{L}}$ is a linear combination of the plate shear components $F_{x,\\mathcal{P}}$ and $F_{y,\\mathcal{P}}$:\n$$\nF_{x,\\mathcal{L}} = \\cos\\theta\\,F_{x,\\mathcal{P}} - \\sin\\theta\\,F_{y,\\mathcal{P}}.\n$$\n- If one were to incorrectly treat $F_{x,\\mathcal{P}}$ as the gait-direction force without correcting for orientation, two systematic effects would arise:\n  1. A projection loss by the factor $\\cos\\theta$ even if $F_{y,\\mathcal{P}} = 0$, underestimating the anterior-posterior component by $(1-\\cos\\theta)\\,F_{x,\\mathcal{P}}$.\n  2. A cross-talk term $-\\sin\\theta\\,F_{y,\\mathcal{P}}$ whereby mediolateral shear contaminates the anterior-posterior component. For $\\theta = 15^{\\circ}$, $\\sin\\theta \\approx 0.259$, so every Newton of mediolateral shear contributes approximately $0.259$ N of spurious anterior-posterior component if uncorrected.\n- Accurate alignment of $F_{x}$ with the gait direction therefore requires applying the rotation to the measured plate-frame shear before any interpretation, especially in tasks with substantial mediolateral forces or when platforms are embedded with known yaw misalignment.",
