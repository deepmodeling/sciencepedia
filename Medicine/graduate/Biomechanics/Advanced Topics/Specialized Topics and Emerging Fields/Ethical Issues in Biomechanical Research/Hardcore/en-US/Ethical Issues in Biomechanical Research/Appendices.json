This practice explores that fundamental tension by having you calculate the expected net benefit in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) while simultaneously evaluating compliance with an absolute risk threshold. This exercise  demonstrates how a study might be justifiable from a consequentialist perspective yet fail to meet non-negotiable safety rules.",

Each participant is expected to gain an average of $0.4$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), a utility-weighted measure of health outcomes combining lifespan and quality of life on a $[0,1]$ scale. There is a risk of a serious adverse event per participant with probability $0.01$, and each serious adverse event is assessed to produce a utility change of $-5$ QALYs for the affected participant.

The provided numerical values are plausible within the context of a clinical trial for a surgical implant. The definition of a QALY scale does not contradict the assignment of a utility change of $-5$, as this change represents a loss of QALYs (equivalent to 5 years of life in perfect health), not a point on the quality-of-life scale itself.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary definitions, data, and constraints to calculate the two requested quantities, $U_{net}$ and $I$. The path to a unique solution is clearly defined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language, using established terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe task is to compute two quantities: the expected net utility per participant, $U_{net}$, and a deontological compliance indicator, $I$.\n\n#### Part 1: Expected Net Utility ($U_{net}$)\nThe problem defines the expected net utility by additively combining beneficial and harmful outcomes. This suggests modeling the total utility $U$ as the sum of a benefit component $U_{benefit}$ and a harm component $U_{harm}$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected net utility is the sum of the expectations of these components:\n$$U_{net} = E[U] = E[U_{benefit} + U_{harm}] = E[U_{benefit}] + E[U_{harm}]$$\nThe problem states, \"Each participant is expected to gain an average of $0.4$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)\". This is a direct statement of the expected value of the benefit component.\n$$E[U_{benefit}] = 0.4 \\text{ QALYs}$$\nThe harm component, $U_{harm}$, is a random variable associated with the risk of a serious adverse event (SAE). We are given:\n- The probability of an SAE, $P_{SAE}$, is $0.01$.\n- The utility change associated with an SAE is $-5$ QALYs.\n- If no SAE occurs (with probability $1 - P_{SAE} = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$), the utility change from this harm component is $0$.\n\nThe expected value of the harm component, $E[U_{harm}]$, is calculated as the sum of the utility of each outcome multiplied by its probability:\n$$E[U_{harm}] = (-5) \\times P_{SAE} + (0) \\times (1 - P_{SAE})$$\nSubstituting the given value for $P_{SAE}$:\n$$E[U_{harm}] = (-5) \\times 0.01 + (0) \\times 0.99 = -0.05 \\text{ QALYs}$$\nNow, the expected net utility $U_{net}$ is found by summing the expected benefit and the expected harm:\n$$U_{net} = E[U_{benefit}] + E[U_{harm}] = 0.4 + (-0.05) = 0.35 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n\n#### Part 2: Deontological Compliance Indicator ($I$)\nThe second task is to determine the value of the binary compliance indicator $I$. The rule for $I$ is given as:\n$$I = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } P_{SAE} \\le P_{threshold} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nWe are provided with the necessary values:\n- The probability of a serious adverse event, $P_{SAE} = 0.01$.\n- The deontological risk constraint threshold, $P_{threshold} = 0.005$.\n\nWe must evaluate the inequality $P_{SAE} \\le P_{threshold}$:\n$$0.01 \\le 0.005$$\nThis inequality is false, as $0.01$ is greater than $0.005$. Therefore, the condition for $I=1$ is not met. According to the definition, the indicator $I$ must be $0$.\n$$I = 0$$\nThis indicates that the study does not comply with the specified deontological risk constraint.\n\n#### Final Answer Assembly\nThe computed values are $U_{net} = 0.35$ and $I=0$. These are to be reported as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} U_{net} & I \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe final result is the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0.35 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond considering the expected value of potential harm, a robust ethical analysis must also account for the uncertainty surrounding that harm.

There are $n=20$ adult participants with incomplete spinal cord injury, screened for low fall risk. For each participant, the short-horizon mobility benefit of the device during the pilot is estimated as $B=0.02$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). A moderate device-related injury (e.g., low-energy fall with soft tissue damage) occurs independently across participants with probability $p=0.05$ and entails a QALY loss of $s=0.10$ per injured participant. The baseline (no-go) utility is defined as $0$. The go decision without precaution is made by comparing the expected total net utility across participants, which adds benefits and subtracts expected harms.\n\nTo incorporate the precautionary principle, the decision-maker subtracts a penalty term $\\lambda \\cdot \\text{uncertainty}$ from the expected utility, where $\\lambda>0$ is a dimensionless trade-off parameter reflecting ethical aversion to uncertainty, and $\\text{uncertainty}$ is operationalized as the standard deviation of the total QALY loss due to injuries under a Bernoulli model with independent injury events across participants.\n\nStarting from first principles in decision theory and probability (expected value and variance of the Binomial model), derive the minimal value of $\\lambda$ at which the penalized expected utility transitions from nonnegative to negative, thereby reversing a go to a no-go decision. Express your final answer for this threshold $\\lambda^{\\star}$ as a dimensionless real number rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in probability theory and decision theory, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nThe problem requires finding the threshold value of the precautionary parameter, $\\lambda^{\\star}$, at which the penalized expected utility of a go-decision transitions from non-negative to negative. This threshold is found by setting the penalized expected utility to zero.\n\nFirst, let us define the variables and constants provided:\nThe number of participants is $n=20$.\nThe mobility benefit per participant is $B=0.02$ QALY.\nThe probability of a single device-related injury is $p=0.05$.\nThe QALY loss associated with a single injury is $s=0.10$.\nThe baseline utility for a no-go decision is $0$.\n\nThe total utility is composed of the total benefit minus the total harm (QALY loss).\nThe total benefit, $U_{benefit}$, is deterministic in this model, as all $n$ participants receive the benefit $B$.\n$$U_{benefit} = n \\cdot B$$\n\nThe harm is probabilistic. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the number of participants who sustain an injury. Since each of the $n$ participants has an independent probability $p$ of injury, $K$ follows a binomial distribution, $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$.\n\nThe total QALY loss, $L$, is a random variable given by the loss per injury, $s$, multiplied by the number of injuries, $K$.\n$$L = s \\cdot K$$\n\nThe unpenalized decision framework is based on the expected total net utility, $\\mathbb{E}[U_{net}]$. This is the total benefit minus the expected total QALY loss.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[U_{net}] = U_{benefit} - \\mathbb{E}[L]$$\nThe expected value of the total loss, $\\mathbb{E}[L]$, is found using the linearity of expectation and the expected value of a binomial random variable, which is $\\mathbb{E}[K] = np$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L] = \\mathbb{E}[s \\cdot K] = s \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[K] = s \\cdot n \\cdot p$$\nTherefore, the unpenalized expected net utility is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[U_{net}] = nB - snp$$\n\nThe problem introduces a precautionary principle penalty. The penalized expected utility, $U_{penalized}$, is the expected net utility minus a penalty term proportional to the uncertainty.\n$$U_{penalized} = \\mathbb{E}[U_{net}] - \\lambda \\cdot \\text{uncertainty}$$\nThe uncertainty is defined as the standard deviation of the total QALY loss, $\\sigma_L$. To find $\\sigma_L$, we first need the variance of the total QALY loss, $\\text{Var}(L)$.\nThe variance of a binomial random variable $K$ is $\\text{Var}(K) = np(1-p)$.\nUsing the properties of variance, $\\text{Var}(aX) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X)$, we find $\\text{Var}(L)$:\n$$\\text{Var}(L) = \\text{Var}(sK) = s^2 \\text{Var}(K) = s^2 np(1-p)$$\nThe uncertainty is the standard deviation, which is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\text{uncertainty} = \\sigma_L = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(L)} = \\sqrt{s^2 np(1-p)} = s \\sqrt{np(1-p)}$$\n\nNow, we can write the full expression for the penalized expected utility:\n$$U_{penalized} = (nB - snp) - \\lambda s \\sqrt{np(1-p)}$$\n\nThe decision reverses from \"go\" to \"no-go\" at the threshold value $\\lambda = \\lambda^{\\star}$ where $U_{penalized}$ equals the baseline utility of $0$. We set the expression to $0$ and solve for $\\lambda^{\\star}$:\n$$0 = (nB - snp) - \\lambda^{\\star} s \\sqrt{np(1-p)}$$\n$$\\lambda^{\\star} s \\sqrt{np(1-p)} = nB - snp$$\n$$\\lambda^{\\star} = \\frac{nB - snp}{s \\sqrt{np(1-p)}}$$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$n=20$, $B=0.02$, $s=0.10$, $p=0.05$.\nFirst, calculate the numerator, which is the unpenalized expected utility:\n$$nB - snp = (20)(0.02) - (0.10)(20)(0.05) = 0.4 - 0.1 = 0.3$$\nNext, calculate the denominator, which is the uncertainty term (without $\\lambda$):\n$$s \\sqrt{np(1-p)} = 0.10 \\sqrt{20 \\cdot 0.05 \\cdot (1-0.05)} = 0.10 \\sqrt{1 \\cdot 0.95} = 0.10 \\sqrt{0.95}$$\nNow, we can compute $\\lambda^{\\star}$:\n$$\\lambda^{\\star} = \\frac{0.3}{0.10 \\sqrt{0.95}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{0.95}}$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we calculate:\n$$\\lambda^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{3}{0.9746794} \\approx 3.07818617$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\lambda^{\\star} \\approx 3.078$$\nThis value represents the minimal aversion to uncertainty, as captured by the parameter $\\lambda$, that would lead a decision-maker to reject the project despite its positive expected utility, based on the magnitude of the uncertainty in potential harm.",
