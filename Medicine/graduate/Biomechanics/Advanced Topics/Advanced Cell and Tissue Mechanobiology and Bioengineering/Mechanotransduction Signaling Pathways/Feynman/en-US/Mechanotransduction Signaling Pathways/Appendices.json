This exercise delves into the fascinating phenomenon of catch bonds, where, counter-intuitively, an applied force can strengthen the bond and prolong its lifetime up to a certain threshold. By modeling the dissociation kinetics of an integrin-fibronectin bond with two competing pathways, this practice challenges you to apply transition-state theory and optimization principles to determine the force that maximizes bond survival, a cornerstone concept in mechanobiology.",
