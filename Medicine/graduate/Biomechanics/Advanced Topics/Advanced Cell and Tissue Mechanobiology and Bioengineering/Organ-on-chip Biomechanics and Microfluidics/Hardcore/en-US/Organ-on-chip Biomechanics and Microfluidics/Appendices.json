            "problem": "A rectangular microchannel feeds the test section of an organ-on-chip device designed to expose adherent endothelial cells to steady wall shear stress under laminar flow. The channel is of width $w$, height $h$, and very large length, with the test section beginning a distance $x_0$ downstream from the inlet and having an axial length $L_{\\text{test}}$. A Newtonian cell-culture medium of density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ is driven at a constant volumetric flow rate $Q$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n-   Channel width: $w = 1.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n-   Channel height: $h = 0.10\\,\\text{mm}$\n-   Test section start position: $x_0 = 1.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n-   Test section length: $L_{\\text{test}} = 8.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n-   Volumetric flow rate: $Q = 300\\,\\mu\\text{L}/\\text{min}$\n-   Fluid density: $\\rho = 1000\\,\\text{kg}/\\text{m}^3$\n-   Fluid dynamic viscosity: $\\mu = 1.0\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n-   Flow assumptions: Steady, incompressible, isothermal, Newtonian fluid, no-slip at walls.\n-   Definition: Hydraulic diameter $D_h = 4A/P$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics, specifically internal channel flow, which is central to microfluidics and organ-on-chip design. The parameters provided are physically realistic for such devices. To confirm the laminar flow assumption, the Reynolds number is computed. The cross-sectional area is $A = w h = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m})(0.10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}^2$. The wetted perimeter is $P = 2(w+h) = 2(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m} + 0.10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}) = 2.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$. The hydraulic diameter is $D_h = 4A/P = 4(1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}^2) / (2.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}) = \\frac{2}{11} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m} \\approx 1.82 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}$. The flow rate is $Q = 300\\,\\mu\\text{L}/\\text{min} = 300 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^3/60\\,\\text{s} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^3/\\text{s}$. The mean velocity is $U = Q/A = (5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^3/\\text{s})/(1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}^2) = 0.05\\,\\text{m/s}$. The Reynolds number based on the hydraulic diameter is $Re_{D_h} = \\rho U D_h / \\mu = (1000)(0.05)(\\frac{2}{11} \\times 10^{-3})/(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) = 100/11 \\approx 9.1$. Since $Re_{D_h} \\ll 2300$, the flow is deeply in the laminar regime, and the problem's premises are consistent. The mention of a \"standard... empirical prefactor\" is acceptable as such constants are well-documented in fluid mechanics literature. The problem is well-posed, objective, and complete.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\n**1) Scaling Estimate for the Hydrodynamic Entrance Length $L_e$**\n\nThe hydrodynamic entrance region is characterized by the growth of boundary layers from the channel walls, which eventually merge to establish a fully developed velocity profile. The length of this region, $L_e$, can be estimated by balancing the inertial and viscous forces that govern this development. We consider the steady, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The momentum equation in the streamwise direction, $x$, is:\n$$ \\rho \\left(u_x \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} + u_y \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y} + u_z \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial z}\\right) = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial z^2}\\right) $$\nIn the entrance region, the velocity profile changes along the $x$-axis as the boundary layers grow. A scaling analysis can be performed by considering the dominant terms.\n-   The streamwise convection term, representing inertia, scales as $\\rho u_x \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} \\sim \\rho U \\frac{U}{L_e} = \\frac{\\rho U^2}{L_e}$, where $U$ is the mean velocity and $L_e$ is the characteristic length over which the velocity profile develops.\n-   The transverse momentum diffusion term, representing viscous effects, is dominant over streamwise diffusion ($\\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial x^2} \\ll \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial y^2}, \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial z^2}$). It scales as $\\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u_x}{\\partial (\\text{transverse})^2} \\sim \\mu \\frac{U}{D^2}$, where $D$ is a characteristic transverse length scale of the cross-section.\n\nThe entrance length $L_e$ is the distance where these two effects are of the same order of magnitude. Equating the scales:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho U^2}{L_e} \\sim \\frac{\\mu U}{D^2} $$\nSolving for $L_e$:\n$$ L_e \\sim \\frac{\\rho U D^2}{\\mu} $$\nIntroducing the kinematic viscosity $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho$, the scaling becomes:\n$$ L_e \\sim \\frac{U D^2}{\\nu} $$\nThis provides the scaling estimate for $L_e$ in terms of $U$, a transverse length scale $D$, and the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$.\n\nTo recapitulate this result in terms of the Reynolds number, we first define the Reynolds number based on the characteristic length $D$ as $Re_D = \\frac{\\rho U D}{\\mu} = \\frac{U D}{\\nu}$. Substituting this into the expression for $L_e$:\n$$ L_e \\sim \\left(\\frac{\\rho U D}{\\mu}\\right) D = Re_D \\cdot D $$\nOr, expressed as a non-dimensional ratio:\n$$ \\frac{L_e}{D} \\sim Re_D $$\nFor a non-circular duct, the appropriate transverse length scale is the hydraulic diameter, $D_h$. Thus, the scaling is $L_e \\sim Re_{D_h} \\cdot D_h$.\n\n**2) Calculation of the Entrance Length $L_e$**\n\nThe scaling law is typically expressed with a constant of proportionality, $C$, which is the empirical prefactor:\n$$ L_e = C \\cdot Re_{D_h} \\cdot D_h $$\nFor laminar flow in ducts, a standard value for this prefactor is $C \\approx 0.05$. We will use this value for the calculation.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary parameters in SI units.\n-   Width: $w = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n-   Height: $h = 0.10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n-   Cross-sectional area: $A = w h = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3})(0.10 \\times 10^{-3}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}^2$\n-   Wetted perimeter: $P = 2(w+h) = 2(1.0 \\times 10^{-3} + 0.10 \\times 10^{-3}) = 2.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n-   Hydraulic diameter: $D_h = \\frac{4A}{P} = \\frac{4(1.0 \\times 10^{-7})}{2.2 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{2}{11} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n-   Flow rate: $Q = 300\\,\\mu\\text{L}/\\text{min} = \\frac{300 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^3}{60\\,\\text{s}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}^3/\\text{s}$\n-   Mean velocity: $U = \\frac{Q}{A} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-7}} = 0.05\\,\\text{m}/\\text{s}$\n-   Reynolds number: $Re_{D_h} = \\frac{\\rho U D_h}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1000\\,\\text{kg/m}^3)(0.05\\,\\text{m/s})(\\frac{2}{11} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s}} = \\frac{100}{11}$\n\nNow, we can calculate the entrance length $L_e$:\n$$ L_e = C \\cdot Re_{D_h} \\cdot D_h = 0.05 \\times \\left(\\frac{100}{11}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{11} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}\\right) $$\n$$ L_e = \\frac{0.05 \\times 200}{121} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m} = \\frac{10}{121} \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m} $$\n$$ L_e \\approx 0.082644... \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m} $$\nConverting to millimeters and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$ L_e \\approx 0.0826\\,\\text{mm} $$\n\n**3) Discussion of Impact and Quantification**\n\nThe calculation shows the hydrodynamic entrance length is $L_e \\approx 0.0826\\,\\text{mm}$. The problem specifies that the test section, where the endothelial cells are cultured, begins a distance $x_0 = 1.0\\,\\text{mm}$ from the channel inlet.\n\nThe flow becomes fully developed for axial positions $x \\geq L_e$. In this case, $L_e \\approx 0.0826\\,\\text{mm}$ is significantly smaller than the position where the test section starts, $x_0 = 1.0\\,\\text{mm}$.\n$$ L_e \\ll x_0 $$\nThis implies that the fluid flow is already fully developed well before it reaches the cells in the test section. The velocity profile is parabolic (for a given cross-section) and invariant along the entire length of the test section, which spans from $x = 1.0\\,\\text{mm}$ to $x = 1.0\\,\\text{mm} + 8.0\\,\\text{mm} = 9.0\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\n**Impact on Wall Shear Stress:** The wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is directly proportional to the velocity gradient at the wall. In fully developed flow, the velocity profile is constant with axial position $x$, which means the velocity gradient at the wall is also constant. Therefore, the wall shear stress is uniform throughout the entire test section. This is a critical feature for a well-designed organ-on-chip experiment, as it ensures that all cells cultured within the test section are subjected to the same, well-defined mechanical stimulus.\n\n**Quantification:** The fraction of the test-section length that is under fully developed conditions can be quantified. Since the flow is already fully developed at the start of the test section ($x_0$), the entire length of the test section, $L_{\\text{test}} = 8.0\\,\\text{mm}$, experiences fully developed flow.\nThe length of the test section under fully developed conditions is $L_{\\text{dev}} = L_{\\text{test}} = 8.0\\,\\text{mm}$.\nThe fraction is:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{L_{\\text{dev}}}{L_{\\text{test}}} = \\frac{8.0\\,\\text{mm}}{8.0\\,\\text{mm}} = 1 $$\nTherefore, $100\\%$ of the test-section length is under fully developed conditions. This confirms the blueprint represents a sound design for achieving uniform wall shear stress on the adherent cells.\n\nThe final reported number, as requested, is the computed entrance length from part 2.\n$L_e \\approx 0.0826\\,\\text{mm}$.",

The solution will be developed in three parts as requested: first, the derivation of the shear rate estimator and its variance; second, the derivation of the variance of the wall shear stress using uncertainty propagation; and third, the numerical computation of the standard deviation of the wall shear stress.\n\nThe wall shear stress for a Newtonian fluid is given by $\\tau_{w} = \\mu G$, where $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $G = \\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{w}$ is the shear rate at the wall ($y=0$). Both $\\mu$ and $G$ are considered sources of uncertainty.\n\n**Task 1: Estimator for Shear Rate $G$ and its Variance**\n\nThe problem specifies a linear velocity profile near the wall, $u(y) = G y$, with a zero intercept. The measurement model for the velocity $u_i$ at a given wall-normal position $y_i$ is\n$$ u_{i} = G y_{i} + \\varepsilon_{i} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{i}$ are independent, zero-mean Gaussian noise terms with a constant variance $\\sigma_{u}^{2}$.

This is the normal equation for a zero-intercept linear regression:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dG} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d}{dG} (u_{i} - G y_{i})^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2(u_{i} - G y_{i})(-y_{i}) = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (u_{i} y_{i} - G y_{i}^{2}) = 0 $$\n$$ \\hat{G} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{i} y_{i} $$\nSolving for the estimator $\\hat{G}$ gives:\n$$ \\hat{G} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} u_{i} y_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}^{2}} $$\nNext, we find the variance of this estimator, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{G})$.

Since $\\hat{G}$ is derived solely from the velocity measurements, $\\mu$ and $\\hat{G}$ are independent, and their covariance is zero, $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\mu, G) = 0$.\nSubstituting these into the variance formula:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau_{w}}^{2} \\approx G_{0}^{2} \\sigma_{\\mu}^{2} + \\mu_{0}^{2} \\sigma_{G}^{2} $$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $\\sigma_{G}^{2} = \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{G})$ from Task 1:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau_{w}}^{2} \\approx G_{0}^{2} \\sigma_{\\mu}^{2} + \\mu_{0}^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}^{2}} \\right) $$\n\n**Task 3: Numerical Calculation of $\\sigma_{\\tau_{w}}$**\n\nWe are given the following data, which must be converted to consistent SI units (m, s, Pa):\n- Measurement positions: $y_{i} \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\\}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\\} \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Velocity standard deviation: $\\sigma_{u} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{mm/s} = 0.05 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n- Mean viscosity: $\\mu_{0} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$.\n- Viscosity standard deviation: $\\sigma_{\\mu} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$.\n- Mean shear rate: $G_{0} = 500\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the sum of squares of the positions:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}^{2} = (2^{2} + 4^{2} + 6^{2} + 8^{2} + 10^{2} + 12^{2}) \\times (10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}^{2} = (4 + 16 + 36 + 64 + 100 + 144) \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}} = 364 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}} $$\nNext, we calculate the two terms contributing to the total variance $\\sigma_{\\tau_{w}}^{2}$.\n\nThe first term is the contribution from viscosity uncertainty:\n$$ G_{0}^{2} \\sigma_{\\mu}^{2} = (500\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})^{2} (2.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s})^{2} $$\n$$ G_{0}^{2} \\sigma_{\\mu}^{2} = (2.5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}) (4.00 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{Pa^{2}\\cdot s^{2}}) = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa^{2}} $$\n\nThe second term is the contribution from velocity measurement uncertainty:\n$$ \\mu_{0}^{2} \\sigma_{G}^{2} = \\mu_{0}^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{u}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i}^{2}} \\right) = (1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s})^{2} \\left( \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m/s})^{2}}{364 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\mu_{0}^{2} \\sigma_{G}^{2} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa^{2}\\cdot s^{2}}) \\left( \\frac{2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}/s^{2}}}{364 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\mu_{0}^{2} \\sigma_{G}^{2} \\approx (1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa^{2}\\cdot s^{2}}) (6.86813\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}) \\approx 6.86813 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa^{2}} $$\n\nThe total variance of the wall shear stress is the sum of these two terms:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau_{w}}^{2} \\approx (1.00 \\times 10^{-4}) + (6.86813 \\times 10^{-6}) \\,\\mathrm{Pa^{2}} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau_{w}}^{2} \\approx (1.00 \\times 10^{-4}) + (0.0686813 \\times 10^{-4}) \\,\\mathrm{Pa^{2}} \\approx 1.0686813 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{Pa^{2}} $$\n\nThe standard deviation, $\\sigma_{\\tau_{w}}$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau_{w}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\tau_{w}}^{2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.0686813 \\times 10^{-4}} \\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau_{w}} \\approx 1.03377 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau_{w}} \\approx 1.03 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$",

Assume the cell behaves as an isotropic, linear elastic half-space under small, frictionless, non-adhesive contact with the indenter. Starting from continuum mechanics, derive the spherical indentation contact relation between indentation depth and force for such a system, incorporate the effect of Poisson's ratio, and implement an estimator for the elastic modulus. Your program must compute the elastic modulus $E$ for each provided test case using a principled estimator, and report the results in kilopascals (kPa), rounded to three decimal places.\n\nUse the following constraints and steps to ensure scientific rigor and proper unit handling:\n\n- Base your derivation on isotropic linear elasticity, geometric compatibility, and quasistatic force balance for frictionless spherical contact. Account for the dimensionless Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ through the appropriate reduced modulus definition for a rigid sphere indenting an elastic half-space.\n- For each test case, perform a linear least-squares fit of the measured force $F$ versus the transformed indentation variable $x = \\delta^{3/2}$ that includes an intercept (to accommodate instrumentation baseline). Only the slope of this fit is used to infer the reduced modulus and then $E$.\n- Convert all quantities to the International System of Units (SI) before performing any calculations. Specifically:\n  - Indentation $\\delta$ is provided in micrometers (μm) and must be converted to meters (m).\n  - Force $F$ is provided in nanoNewtons (nN) and must be converted to Newtons (N).\n  - Sphere radius $R$ is provided in micrometers (μm) and must be converted to meters (m).\n- Express the final elastic modulus $E$ in kilopascals (kPa) and round to three decimal places.\n\nTest suite. Each test case provides: sphere radius $R$ (in μm), Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ (dimensionless), indentation depths $\\delta$ (in μm), and measured forces $F$ (in nN). The test suite covers a nominal case, a nearly incompressible boundary, small-probe sensitivity, and the inclusion of a zero-indentation datum.\n\n- Test case 1 (nominal endothelial-like cell under moderate indentation):\n  - $R = 5.0$ μm, $\\nu = 0.47$\n  - $\\delta = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]$ μm\n  - $F = [0.68384, 1.93520, 3.55588, 5.47636]$ nN\n- Test case 2 (nearly incompressible cell with baseline offset):\n  - $R = 10.0$ μm, $\\nu = 0.499$\n  - $\\delta = [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]$ μm\n  - $F = [0.95000, 4.31100, 9.09600, 14.96800]$ nN\n- Test case 3 (small probe and low stiffness, high sensitivity to unit conversion):\n  - $R = 2.0$ μm, $\\nu = 0.40$\n  - $\\delta = [0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20]$ μm\n  - $F = [0.02510, 0.07100, 0.13030, 0.20090]$ nN\n- Test case 4 (includes zero indentation datum to test intercept handling):\n  - $R = 3.0$ μm, $\\nu = 0.45$\n  - $\\delta = [0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15]$ μm\n  - $F = [0.00000, 0.25880, 0.73210, 1.34500]$ nN\n\nComputation requirements:\n\n- For each test case, define $x_i = \\delta_i^{3/2}$ in meters$^{3/2}$ and $y_i = F_i$ in Newtons. Fit $y_i = a x_i + b$ via linear least squares; use the fitted slope $a$ to infer the reduced modulus $E^\\ast$ and then $E$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of an estimator for the elastic modulus of a cell, modeled as a linear elastic half-space, based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) indentation data. The solution proceeds from the principles of Hertzian contact mechanics.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the frictionless, non-adhesive contact between a rigid spherical indenter of radius $R$ and an elastic half-space is given by the Hertz theory. This theory relates the applied force $F$ to the resulting indentation depth $\\delta$. For small indentations (i.e., $\\delta \\ll R$), the force is given by:\n$$\nF = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\sqrt{R} \\delta^{3/2}\n$$\nIn this equation, $E^*$ is the reduced elastic modulus, which combines the elastic properties of the two contacting bodies. For a rigid indenter (Young's modulus $E_{indenter} \\to \\infty$) contacting an elastic sample with Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, the reduced modulus simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - \\nu^2}{E}\n$$\nTherefore, $E^* = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}$. Substituting this into the Hertz equation yields the direct relationship between force and the sample's intrinsic properties:\n$$\nF = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2} \\sqrt{R} \\delta^{3/2}\n$$\n\nTo determine the elastic modulus $E$ from a set of measured force-indentation data pairs $(\\delta_i, F_i)$, we can linearize this model. The problem states that the underlying relationship is of the form $F \\propto \\delta^{3/2}$. We define a new independent variable $x = \\delta^{3/2}$ and the dependent variable $y = F$. The physical model then takes the form of a linear equation passing through the origin:\n$$\ny = a x\n$$\nwhere the slope $a$ encapsulates the material and geometric parameters:\n$$\na = \\frac{4 E \\sqrt{R}}{3 (1 - \\nu^2)}\n$$\nThe problem specifies fitting the experimental data to a more general linear model, $y_i = a x_i + b$, using a linear least-squares method. This is a robust practice that accounts for potential baseline offsets in the force measurement (represented by the intercept $b$). The physical parameter $E$ is determined solely from the fitted slope $a$.\n\nBy rearranging the expression for the slope $a$, we can derive a formula to calculate the Young's modulus $E$:\n$$\nE = \\frac{3a (1 - \\nu^2)}{4 \\sqrt{R}}\n$$\n\nThe computational procedure to estimate $E$ for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. **Unit Conversion**: All provided parameters must be converted to the International System of Units (SI) to ensure dimensional consistency in the calculations.\n   - Sphere radius $R$ is converted from micrometers ($\\mu$m) to meters (m) by multiplying by $10^{-6}$.\n   - Indentation depths $\\delta_i$ are converted from micrometers ($\\mu$m) to meters (m) by multiplying by $10^{-6}$.\n   - Measured forces $F_i$ are converted from nanoNewtons (nN) to Newtons (N) by multiplying by $10^{-9}$.\n\n$2$. **Data Transformation**: For each data pair $(\\delta_i, F_i)$, the independent variable for the linear fit is calculated as $x_i = \\delta_i^{3/2}$. The dependent variable is $y_i = F_i$. All calculations are performed using the SI unit values.\n\n$3$. **Linear Regression**: A linear least-squares regression is performed on the set of points $(x_i, y_i)$ to find the slope $a$ of the best-fit line $y = ax + b$.\n\n$4$. **Elastic Modulus Calculation**: The Young's modulus $E$ is calculated using the derived formula with the fitted slope $a$, the given Poisson's ratio $\\nu$, and the sphere radius $R$ in SI units. The resulting value for $E$ will be in Pascals (Pa).\n\n$5$. **Final Unit Conversion and Rounding**: The calculated modulus $E$ in Pascals is converted to kilopascals (kPa) by dividing by $1000$. The final result is rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nThis structured, principle-based approach ensures that the estimation of the elastic modulus is scientifically rigorous, computationally robust, and correctly handles all physical units. The method is applied systematically to each of the $4$ provided test cases.",
