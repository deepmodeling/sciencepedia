Before analyzing complex physiological flows, it is essential to master the idealized case of steady, laminar flow through a straight, rigid vessel. This foundational exercise  guides you through a first-principles derivation of the wall shear stress from the Navier-Stokes equations, yielding the classic Poiseuille relationship that serves as a cornerstone for much of vascular biomechanics.",

            "problem": "Consider a straight, rigid, cylindrical artery of radius $R$ and length $L$, filled with an incompressible Newtonian fluid of density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$. The flow is steady, laminar, axisymmetric, and fully developed along the axial coordinate $z$; gravitational and other body forces are negligible. Let $u(r)$ denote the axial velocity as a function of the radial coordinate $r$, with no-slip at the wall and symmetry at the centerline. The volumetric flow rate is $Q$, and the pressure gradient $\\partial p / \\partial z$ is uniform along the vessel.\n\nStarting from the axisymmetric form of the Navier–Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates and the conservation of mass, derive the axial velocity profile $u(r)$ for this flow. Then, using the definition of wall shear stress (WSS), $\\tau_w$, as the magnitude of the viscous shear stress acting on the arterial wall at $r=R$, express $\\tau_w$ in terms of $Q$, $R$, and $\\mu$ only. Assume that $Q$ is positive in the direction of decreasing pressure. Use the fully developed, axisymmetric solution consistent with the stated assumptions.

Steady flow: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$ for all quantities.\n2.  Axisymmetric flow: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$ for all quantities. By symmetry, the tangential velocity $v_{\\theta}$ must be zero, $v_{\\theta} = 0$.\n3.  Fully developed flow along $z$: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = 0$. This implies that the velocity profile $u(r)$ does not change along the axial direction.\n\nApplying these assumptions to the continuity equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial(r v_r)}{\\partial r} + 0 + 0 = 0 \\implies \\frac{d(r v_r)}{dr} = 0 $$\nIntegrating this yields $r v_r = \\text{constant}$. At the centerline ($r=0$), the radial velocity $v_r$ must be finite. For the product $r v_r$ to be constant and finite as $r \\to 0$, the constant must be zero. Therefore, $v_r = 0$ everywhere in the flow.\n\nNow we simplify the momentum equations:\n$r$-component: With $v_r=0$ and $v_{\\theta}=0$, all terms on the left-hand side and all viscous terms on the right-hand side become zero. The equation reduces to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = 0 $$\nThis shows that pressure $p$ does not vary with the radial coordinate $r$.\n\n$\\theta$-component: With $v_r = 0$, $v_{\\theta}=0$, and axisymmetry ($\\partial p/\\partial \\theta = 0$), the equation becomes $0 = 0$, which is trivially satisfied.\n\n$z$-component: All terms on the left-hand side (inertial terms) are zero because $\\partial u/\\partial t=0$, $v_r=0$, and $\\partial u/\\partial z=0$. The viscous terms simplify due to axisymmetry ($\\partial^2 u/\\partial \\theta^2 = 0$) and fully developed flow ($\\partial^2 u/\\partial z^2 = 0$). The equation simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}\\right) \\right] $$\nSince $\\partial p/\\partial r = 0$ and $\\partial p/\\partial \\theta=0$, pressure $p$ can only be a function of $z$, so we can write $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}$ as the total derivative $\\frac{dp}{dz}$. The problem states this gradient is uniform, so it is a constant. Rearranging the equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dz} = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{du}{dr}\\right) $$\nAs $u$ is only a function of $r$, we use total derivatives. Let the constant pressure gradient be $G = \\frac{dp}{dz}$.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{du}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{G}{\\mu} r $$\nIntegrating once with respect to $r$:\n$$ r \\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} r^2 + C_1 $$\n$$\\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} r + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nThe symmetry boundary condition at the centerline ($r=0$) requires the velocity gradient $\\frac{du}{dr}$ to be finite. For this to hold, the constant of integration $C_1$ must be zero.\n$$ \\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} r $$\nIntegrating a second time:\n$$ u(r) = \\frac{G}{4\\mu} r^2 + C_2 $$\nWe use the no-slip boundary condition at the wall, $u(R) = 0$, to find $C_2$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{G}{4\\mu} R^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{G}{4\\mu} R^2 $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the expression for $u(r)$, we obtain the axial velocity profile:\n$$ u(r) = \\frac{G}{4\\mu} r^2 - \\frac{G}{4\\mu} R^2 = \\frac{G}{4\\mu} (r^2 - R^2) = -\\frac{G}{4\\mu}(R^2 - r^2) $$\nSince flow occurs in the direction of decreasing pressure, $\\frac{dp}{dz} = G  0$, which ensures that $u(r)$ is positive for $r  R$, resulting in the characteristic parabolic profile.\n\nNext, we relate the volumetric flow rate $Q$ to the pressure gradient $G$. $Q$ is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$ Q = \\int_A u(r) dA $$\nThe differential area element is $dA = 2\\pi r dr$.\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{G}{4\\mu}(r^2 - R^2) (2\\pi r) dr = \\frac{2\\pi G}{4\\mu} \\int_{0}^{R} (r^3 - R^2 r) dr $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi G}{2\\mu} \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} - \\frac{R^2 r^2}{2} \\right]_0^R = \\frac{\\pi G}{2\\mu} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} - \\frac{R^4}{2} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi G}{2\\mu} \\left( -\\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = -\\frac{\\pi G R^4}{8\\mu} $$\nThis is the Hagen-Poiseuille law. We can invert this to express the pressure gradient $G$ in terms of the flow rate $Q$:\n$$ G = -\\frac{8 \\mu Q}{\\pi R^4} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. The shear stress component $\\tau_{rz}$ for a Newtonian fluid in cylindrical coordinates is $\\tau_{rz} = \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} + \\frac{\\partial v_r}{\\partial z} \\right)$. Since $v_r = 0$, this simplifies to $\\tau_{rz} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dr}$.\nWall shear stress $\\tau_w$ is the magnitude of this stress evaluated at the wall, $r=R$.\n$$ \\tau_w = |\\tau_{rz}|_{r=R} = \\left| \\mu \\frac{du}{dr} \\right|_{r=R} $$\nWe previously found the velocity gradient:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dr} = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} r $$\nEvaluating at $r=R$:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{du}{dr} \\right|_{r=R} = \\frac{G R}{2\\mu} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\tau_w$:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\left| \\mu \\left( \\frac{G R}{2\\mu} \\right) \\right| = \\left| \\frac{G R}{2} \\right| $$\nSince $G  0$ and $R > 0$, the quantity inside the absolute value is negative. Thus, we take its negative:\n$$ \\tau_w = -\\frac{G R}{2} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $G$ in terms of $Q$, $R$, and $\\mu$:\n$$ \\tau_w = -\\left( -\\frac{8 \\mu Q}{\\pi R^4} \\right) \\frac{R}{2} = \\frac{8 \\mu Q R}{2 \\pi R^4} $$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result for the wall shear stress:\n$$ \\tau_w = \\frac{4 \\mu Q}{\\pi R^3} $$\nThis expression relates the wall shear stress directly to the measurable macroscopic quantities of flow rate $Q$, vessel radius $R$, and fluid viscosity $\\mu$.",

In simple shear, the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the absolute value of the velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of flow. Here, the axial velocity is $u$ and the wall-normal coordinate is $y$, so the shear rate is given by:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma} = \\left| \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right|\n$$\nThe problem provides the velocity gradient at the lumen–glycocalyx interface as $\\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right|_{\\text{interface}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Thus, the shear rate at this location is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma} = |8.0 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}| = 800\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a no-slip condition at the endothelial surface (the wall) and that viscous traction (shear stress) is continuous across the lumen-glycocalyx interface. This means the shear stress at the interface is equal to the shear stress at the wall. Therefore, we can calculate the wall shear stress $\\tau_w$ by evaluating the shear stress at the interface using the given shear rate.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the apparent viscosity $\\eta$ at this shear rate using the Carreau–Yasuda model:\n$$\n\\eta(\\dot{\\gamma}) = \\eta_{\\infty} + \\left(\\eta_{0} - \\eta_{\\infty}\\right)\\left[1 + \\left(\\lambda\\,\\dot{\\gamma}\\right)^{a}\\right]^{\\frac{n - 1}{a}}\n$$\nWe substitute the given parameter values and the calculated shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma} = 800\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n-   $\\eta_{0} = 5.6 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n-   $\\eta_{\\infty} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n-   $\\lambda = 3.313\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n-   $a = 2$\n-   $n = 0.3568$\n\nThe term $\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}$ is:\n$$\n\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma} = (3.313\\ \\mathrm{s})(800\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 2650.4\n$$\nThe term $[1 + (\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma})^a]$ becomes:\n$$\n1 + (2650.4)^{2} = 1 + 7024620.16 = 7024621.16\n$$\nThe exponent is:\n$$\n\\frac{n - 1}{a} = \\frac{0.3568 - 1}{2} = \\frac{-0.6432}{2} = -0.3216\n$$\nNow, we compute the bracketed term raised to this power:\n$$\n\\left[1 + \\left(\\lambda\\,\\dot{\\gamma}\\right)^{a}\\right]^{\\frac{n - 1}{a}} = (7024621.16)^{-0.3216} \\approx 0.0062824\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the viscosity equation:\n$$\n\\eta(800) = (3.5 \\times 10^{-3}) + (5.6 \\times 10^{-2} - 3.5 \\times 10^{-3})(0.0062824)\n$$\n$$\n\\eta(800) = 0.0035 + (0.0525)(0.0062824)\n$$\n$$\n\\eta(800) = 0.0035 + 0.000329826 \\approx 0.0038298\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}\n$$\nThis demonstrates the shear-thinning property of blood: at a high shear rate of $800\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, the apparent viscosity ($ \\approx 3.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$) is much closer to the infinite-shear viscosity ($\\eta_{\\infty} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$) than the zero-shear viscosity ($\\eta_{0} = 5.6 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$).\n\nFinally, we compute the wall shear stress $\\tau_w$:\n$$\n\\tau_w = \\eta(800) \\times \\dot{\\gamma} = (0.0038298\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}) \\times (800\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_w \\approx 3.0638\\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the wall shear stress is $3.06\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nTo assess the physiological relevance of this value, we compare it to established mechanobiological ranges. In large arteries like the common carotid, endothelial cells maintain a healthy, quiescent, and atheroprotective phenotype when exposed to time-averaged wall shear stress in the range of approximately $1.0 - 7.0\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ (or $10 - 70\\ \\mathrm{dyn/cm^2}$), with an optimal range often cited as $1.5 - 3.0\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$. Conversely, regions of low wall shear stress ($ 0.5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$) or highly oscillatory/reversing shear are atheroprone, promoting endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and lesion development. The measured value of $\\tau_w = 3.06\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ represents an instantaneous shear stress under pulsatile conditions, likely near the systolic peak. This value falls squarely within the physiological range associated with endothelial health. Assuming the flow is predominantly unidirectional, this level of instantaneous shear stress is consistent with an atheroprotective hemodynamic environment.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics (specifically, Poiseuille flow), well-posed with all necessary data and clear definitions, and objective in its language. The assumptions, while representing a simplification of complex physiological reality, are explicitly stated and allow for a rigorous, formalizable solution. The problem is a standard exercise in biomechanical analysis.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the necessary physical quantities from the fundamental principles laid out in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we derive the formula for the instantaneous wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. The problem assumes laminar, axisymmetric, fully developed flow in a straight circular tube of radius $R$. This is the classic Hagen-Poiseuille flow scenario. The velocity profile $u(r)$ is parabolic, where $r$ is the radial coordinate.\nFor an incompressible Newtonian fluid, the volumetric flow rate $Q$ is related to the velocity profile $u(r)$ by:\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{R} u(r) 2\\pi r \\, dr$$\nThe velocity profile for Poiseuille flow is given by $u(r) = u_{max} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)$. Integrating this profile to find its relationship with $Q$ yields $Q = \\frac{1}{2} \\pi R^2 u_{max}$, which allows us to express the velocity profile in terms of the measurable flow rate $Q$:\n$$u(r, t) = \\frac{2Q(t)}{\\pi R^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right)$$\nHere, we adopt a quasi-steady assumption, where the profile at any instant $t$ is determined by the instantaneous flow rate $Q(t)$.\n\nThe wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is the frictional force per unit area exerted by the fluid on the tube wall. It is related to the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ and the gradient of the axial velocity at the wall ($r=R$). Adopting the convention that $\\tau_w$ is positive for positive flow, which implies $\\tau_w$ is proportional to $-\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} = \\frac{2Q(t)}{\\pi R^2} \\left(-\\frac{2r}{R^2}\\right) = -\\frac{4Q(t)r}{\\pi R^4}$$\nEvaluating at the wall, $r=R$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}\\right|_{r=R} = -\\frac{4Q(t)}{\\pi R^3}$$\nThus, the instantaneous wall shear stress vector (which is purely axial in this 1D model) is:\n$$\\tau_w(t) = \\frac{4\\mu Q(t)}{\\pi R^3}$$\nThe sign of $\\tau_w(t)$ is directly coupled to the sign of the flow rate $Q(t)$, consistent with the problem requirements.\n\nNext, we define the target quantities, Time-Averaged Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS) and Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), for a cardiac cycle discretized into $N$ time points $t_k$.\n\nThe TAWSS is the time-average of the magnitude of the wall shear stress. In discrete form:\n$$\\mathrm{TAWSS} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} |\\tau_w(t_k)| = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\left| \\frac{4\\mu Q(t_k)}{\\pi R^3} \\right| = \\frac{4\\mu}{\\pi N R^3} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} |Q(t_k)|$$\n\nThe OSI is a dimensionless measure of the oscillation in the shear stress vector. The standard discrete definition is:\n$$\\mathrm{OSI} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\left| \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\tau_w(t_k) \\right|}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} |\\tau_w(t_k)|} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tau_w(t_k)$:\n$$\\mathrm{OSI} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\left| \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\frac{4\\mu Q(t_k)}{\\pi R^3} \\right|}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\left| \\frac{4\\mu Q(t_k)}{\\pi R^3} \\right|} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\left| \\frac{4\\mu}{\\pi R^3} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} Q(t_k) \\right|}{\\frac{4\\mu}{\\pi R^3} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} |Q(t_k)|} \\right)$$\nThe constant term $\\frac{4\\mu}{\\pi R^3}$ cancels, revealing that OSI is independent of the local radius $R$ and viscosity $\\mu$, and depends only on the flow waveform $Q(t_k)$:\n$$\\mathrm{OSI} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\left| \\sum_{k=1}^{N} Q(t_k) \\right|}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} |Q(t_k)|} \\right)$$\nA critical consequence of this is that for a given test case, where the flow waveform $Q(t_k)$ is the same for pre-stent and post-stent scenarios, the OSI will be identical for all axial locations and identical for pre- and post-stent states. Therefore, the change $\\Delta \\mathrm{OSI} = \\mathrm{OSI}_{\\text{post}} - \\mathrm{OSI}_{\\text{pre}}$ is zero for all locations, and the segment-average $\\Delta \\mathrm{OSI}$ is also zero.\n\nThe computational algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given the arrays of pre-stent radii $R_{\\text{pre}}$, post-stent radii $R_{\\text{post}}$, and the flow waveform $Q(t_k)$, and constants $\\mu$, $N$, $\\tau_{\\text{low}}$, $\\mathrm{OSI}_{\\text{high}}$. The number of axial locations is $M=9$.\n2.  Calculate the single OSI value for the test case using the derived formula based on $Q(t_k)$. This will serve as both $\\mathrm{OSI}_{\\text{pre}}$ and $\\mathrm{OSI}_{\\text{post}}$ for all locations. The segment-average $\\Delta \\mathrm{OSI}$ is $0.0$.\n3.  For each axial location $i$ from $0$ to $M-1$:\n    a. Calculate $\\mathrm{TAWSS}_{\\text{pre}, i}$ using its formula with radius $R_{\\text{pre}, i}$.\n    b. Calculate $\\mathrm{TAWSS}_{\\text{post}, i}$ using its formula with radius $R_{\\text{post}, i}$.\n    c. Compute the change $\\Delta \\mathrm{TAWSS}_i = \\mathrm{TAWSS}_{\\text{post}, i} - \\mathrm{TAWSS}_{\\text{pre}, i}$.\n4.  Compute the segment-average $\\Delta \\mathrm{TAWSS}$ by averaging the $\\Delta \\mathrm{TAWSS}_i$ values over all $M$ locations.\n5.  Identify at-risk locations. For each axial location $i$, check if the post-stent values satisfy the combined criterion: $\\mathrm{TAWSS}_{\\text{post}, i}  \\tau_{\\text{low}}$ AND $\\mathrm{OSI}_{\\text{post}}  \\mathrm{OSI}_{\\text{high}}$.\n6.  Collect the zero-based indices $i$ of all locations that meet the criterion. Sort these indices in ascending order.\n7.  Assemble the final result for the test case: a list containing the rounded segment-average $\\Delta \\mathrm{TAWSS}$, the rounded segment-average $\\Delta \\mathrm{OSI}$ ($0.0$), and the sorted list of at-risk indices.\n\nThis procedure will be applied to each of the three test cases provided.",
