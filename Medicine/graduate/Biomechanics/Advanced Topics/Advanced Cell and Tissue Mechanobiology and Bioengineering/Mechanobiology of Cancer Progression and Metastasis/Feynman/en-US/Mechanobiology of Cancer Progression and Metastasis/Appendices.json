It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and biophysics (specifically, the Bell model for molecular dissociation), is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, precise language.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the force-dependent unbinding rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)$.\nThe unbinding rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is described by transition-state theory, with its dependence on the activation free-energy barrier $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ given by the Arrhenius-like form:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThis can be written with a pre-exponential factor $A$, which represents the attempt frequency and depends on the shape of the free energy potential near the bound state minimum.\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that the force $F$ modifies the free-energy barrier according to the linear-coupling approximation:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F) = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0) - F x_{b}$$\nwhere $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)$ is the barrier height at zero force and $x_{b}$ is the projected distance along the reaction coordinate from the bound state to the transition state.

Therefore, the force-dependent lifetime $\\tau(F)$ is related to the force-dependent unbinding rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)$ by:\n$$\\tau(F) = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)}$$\nSimilarly, the zero-force lifetime $\\tau_{0}$ is related to the zero-force rate $k_{0}$:\n$$\\tau_{0} = \\frac{1}{k_{0}}$$\nUsing the expression for $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)$ derived in Part 1, we can write:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\tau(F)} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nSolving for $\\tau(F)$ yields:\n$$\\tau(F) = \\tau_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics (Euler–Bernoulli beam theory), well-posed with sufficient information and appropriate boundary conditions for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. The physical parameters provided are realistic for a mechanobiology experiment involving cellular traction force measurement on a micro-pillar array.\n\nWe begin by deriving the tip deflection of the cantilever pillar. The governing equation is the Euler–Bernoulli beam law:\n$$E I \\frac{d^{2}w}{dx^{2}} = M(x)$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus, $I$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section, $w(x)$ is the transverse deflection at a position $x$ along the pillar's axis, and $M(x)$ is the internal bending moment at that position.\n\nLet the pillar be fixed at the base, which we define as $x=0$, and free at the tip, $x=L$. A concentrated lateral force $F$ is applied at the tip, $x=L$. To find the bending moment $M(x)$, we consider a section of the beam at an arbitrary position $x$ ($0 \\le x \\le L$). The moment at this section is caused by the force $F$ acting with a lever arm of $(L-x)$. By a common sign convention, this creates a moment $M(x) = F(L-x)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the beam equation gives:\n$$E I \\frac{d^{2}w}{dx^{2}} = F(L-x)$$\nTo find the slope of the pillar, $\\frac{dw}{dx}$, we integrate the equation with respect to $x$:\n$$E I \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\int F(L-x) \\, dx = F\\left(Lx - \\frac{x^{2}}{2}\\right) + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration.\n\nTo find the deflection $w(x)$, we integrate again:\n$$E I w(x) = \\int \\left[ F\\left(Lx - \\frac{x^{2}}{2}\\right) + C_1 \\right] \\, dx = F\\left(\\frac{Lx^{2}}{2} - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}\\right) + C_1 x + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration.\n\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by applying the boundary conditions for a cantilever beam. At the fixed base ($x=0$), both the deflection and the slope must be zero.\n1.  Zero deflection at the base: $w(0)=0$.\n    $$E I w(0) = F\\left(\\frac{L(0)^{2}}{2} - \\frac{(0)^{3}}{6}\\right) + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2=0$$\n2.

Since $1 \\, \\text{µm} = 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$, the deflection is:\n$$\\delta \\approx 0.503 \\, \\text{µm}$$\n\nFinally, we discuss the scaling of deflection with pillar stiffness and its implications. The stiffness $k$ of the pillar is defined as the force per unit deflection, $k = F/\\delta$. From our derived expression, the stiffness is $k = \\frac{3E\\pi r^{4}}{4L^{3}}$. The deflection is $\\delta = F/k$.\nThe deflection scales with the geometric and material parameters as $\\delta \\propto L^{3}$, $\\delta \\propto E^{-1}$, and $\\delta \\propto r^{-4}$.\nTo achieve high sensitivity for measuring small forces, a large deflection is desirable. This implies that the pillar should be designed to be compliant (i.e., have a low stiffness $k$). Based on the scaling relationships, sensitivity is maximized by:\n- Increasing the pillar height $L$, as deflection scales with $L^{3}$.\n- Using a softer material with a lower Young's modulus $E$, as deflection is inversely proportional to $E$.\n- Decreasing the pillar radius $r$, as deflection is inversely proportional to $r^{4}$. This is the most dominant parameter.\nTherefore, to detect malignancy-associated forces, which can be subtle, an array of long, thin pillars made of a soft material like PDMS is ideal. Such a configuration amplifies the mechanical signal (the force) into a larger, more easily measurable output (the deflection), enabling the differentiation of cellular phenotypes based on their mechanical footprint.",

The language is objective and the parameters are physically plausible. The simplifications (uniform regular hexagons, fixed area) render the problem analytically tractable without making it trivial. It correctly tests the understanding of how energy contributions sum up to create mechanical tension.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the energy functional for the epithelial tissue. For a vertex model, the total energy $E$ is the sum of contributions from all cells $\\alpha$ and all cell-cell junctions $<ij>$:\n$$\nE = \\sum_{\\alpha} \\frac{1}{2} K_P (P_\\alpha - P_0)^2 + \\sum_{<ij>} (\\Gamma - j) l_{ij}\n$$\nThe first term represents the energy stored due to perimeter elasticity, where $P_\\alpha$ is the perimeter of cell $\\alpha$. The second term represents the energy of all junctions, where $l_{ij}$ is the length of the junction between vertices $i$ and $j$, and $(\\Gamma-j)$ is the effective line tension of the junction, combining actomyosin contractility $\\Gamma$ and E-cadherin adhesion $j$. The area-dependent term is omitted as the problem enforces the constraint $A = A_0$.\n\nThe junctional tension $T_k$ on a specific junction $k$ with length $l_k$ is defined as the partial derivative of the total energy $E$ with respect to $l_k$:\n$$\nT_k = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial l_k}\n$$\nTo evaluate this derivative, we consider the terms in $E$ that depend on $l_k$. The line tension term $\\sum_{<ij>} (\\Gamma - j) l_{ij}$ contains a term $(\\Gamma - j) l_k$, whose derivative with respect to $l_k$ is simply $(\\Gamma - j)$.\n\nThe perimeter elasticity term $\\sum_{\\alpha} \\frac{1}{2} K_P (P_\\alpha - P_0)^2$ also depends on $l_k$. A specific junction $k$ forms part of the boundary of exactly two adjacent cells, let's call them cell $1$ and cell $2$. Therefore, only their perimeters, $P_1$ and $P_2$, depend on $l_k$. The perimeter of any cell is the sum of the lengths of its bounding junctions, so $\\frac{\\partial P_1}{\\partial l_k} = 1$ and $\\frac{\\partial P_2}{\\partial l_k} = 1$. The derivatives for all other cells are zero. We apply the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial l_k} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} K_P (P_1 - P_0)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} K_P (P_2 - P_0)^2 \\right) = K_P (P_1 - P_0) \\frac{\\partial P_1}{\\partial l_k} + K_P (P_2 - P_0) \\frac{\\partial P_2}{\\partial l_k}\n$$\n$$\n= K_P (P_1 - P_0) + K_P (P_2 - P_0)\n$$\nCombining both contributions, the tension on junction $k$ is:\n$$\nT_k = K_P (P_1 - P_0) + K_P (P_2 - P_0) + (\\Gamma - j)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a state of uniform regular hexagonal tiling. In this configuration, all cells are identical, so their perimeters are equal: $P_1 = P_2 = P$. The tension $T$ is therefore the same for all junctions:\n$$\nT = 2 K_P (P - P_0) + \\Gamma - j\n$$\nTo use this formula, we must determine the perimeter $P$ of the hexagons. The problem states that the cell area $A$ is constrained to be $A_0$. For a regular hexagon with side length $l$, the area and perimeter are given by:\n$$\nA = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} l^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P = 6l\n$$\nUsing the area constraint $A = A_0$, we can solve for $l$:\n$$\nl = \\sqrt{\\frac{2A_0}{3\\sqrt{3}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the perimeter equation gives $P$ in terms of $A_0$:\n$$\nP = 6l = 6\\sqrt{\\frac{2A_0}{3\\sqrt{3}}} = \\sqrt{36 \\cdot \\frac{2A_0}{3\\sqrt{3}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{72A_0}{3\\sqrt{3}}} = \\sqrt{24\\sqrt{3} A_0}\n$$\nThis value of $P$ is calculated from the given constant $A_0 = 1.5 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2$. The preferred perimeter $P_0$ is specified for each test case, sometimes equaling this computed $P$ and sometimes deviating from it.\n\nThe final algorithm is as follows:\n1. For each test case, retrieve the parameters $A_0$, $K_P$, $\\Gamma$, $j$, the definition of $P_0$, and $T_{\\text{break}}$.\n2. Calculate the hexagon's actual perimeter $P$ using the formula $P = \\sqrt{24\\sqrt{3} A_0}$.\n3. Determine the value of the preferred perimeter $P_0$ based on the test case specification (e.g., $P_0 = P$ or $P_0 = P - \\delta$).\n4. Calculate the junctional tension $T$ using the derived formula $T = 2 K_P (P - P_0) + \\Gamma - j$.\n5. Compare the computed tension $T$ to the threshold $T_{\\text{break}}$. The prediction for transition to single-cell migration is true if $T > T_{\\text{break}}$ and false otherwise.\n6. Store the pair $[T, \\text{prediction}]$ for each test case.",
