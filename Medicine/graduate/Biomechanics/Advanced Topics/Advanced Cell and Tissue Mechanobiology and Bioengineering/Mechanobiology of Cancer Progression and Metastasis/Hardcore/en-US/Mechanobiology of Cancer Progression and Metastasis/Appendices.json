It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and biophysics (specifically, the Bell model for molecular dissociation), is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, precise language.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the force-dependent unbinding rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)$.\nThe unbinding rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$ is described by transition-state theory, with its dependence on the activation free-energy barrier $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}$ given by the Arrhenius-like form:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThis can be written with a pre-exponential factor $A$, which represents the attempt frequency and depends on the shape of the free energy potential near the bound state minimum.\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F)}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that the force $F$ modifies the free-energy barrier according to the linear-coupling approximation:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(F) = \\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0) - F x_{b}$$\nwhere $\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)$ is the barrier height at zero force and $x_{b}$ is the projected distance along the reaction coordinate from the bound state to the transition state. Substituting this expression into the rate equation gives:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0) - F x_{b}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nWe can separate the exponential term:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThe term $A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)}{k_{B}T}\\right)$ is precisely the unbinding rate in the absence of external force, which is defined as $k_{0}$.\n$$k_{0} = k_{\\mathrm{off}}(0) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}(0)}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $k_{0}$ back into the expression for $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)$, we arrive at the force-dependent unbinding rate:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F) = k_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThis is the celebrated Bell model equation for a slip bond.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the mean lifetime $\\tau(F)$.\nThe mean lifetime $\\tau$ of a state that decays via a first-order process is the reciprocal of the rate constant for that process. Therefore, the force-dependent lifetime $\\tau(F)$ is related to the force-dependent unbinding rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)$ by:\n$$\\tau(F) = \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)}$$\nSimilarly, the zero-force lifetime $\\tau_{0}$ is related to the zero-force rate $k_{0}$:\n$$\\tau_{0} = \\frac{1}{k_{0}}$$\nUsing the expression for $k_{\\mathrm{off}}(F)$ derived in Part 1, we can write:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\tau(F)} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nSolving for $\\tau(F)$ yields:\n$$\\tau(F) = \\tau_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics (Euler–Bernoulli beam theory), well-posed with sufficient information and appropriate boundary conditions for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. The physical parameters provided are realistic for a mechanobiology experiment involving cellular traction force measurement on a micro-pillar array.\n\nWe begin by deriving the tip deflection of the cantilever pillar. The governing equation is the Euler–Bernoulli beam law:\n$$E I \\frac{d^{2}w}{dx^{2}} = M(x)$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus, $I$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section, $w(x)$ is the transverse deflection at a position $x$ along the pillar's axis, and $M(x)$ is the internal bending moment at that position.\n\nLet the pillar be fixed at the base, which we define as $x=0$, and free at the tip, $x=L$. A concentrated lateral force $F$ is applied at the tip, $x=L$. To find the bending moment $M(x)$, we consider a section of the beam at an arbitrary position $x$ ($0 \\le x \\le L$). The moment at this section is caused by the force $F$ acting with a lever arm of $(L-x)$. By a common sign convention, this creates a moment $M(x) = F(L-x)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the beam equation gives:\n$$E I \\frac{d^{2}w}{dx^{2}} = F(L-x)$$\nTo find the slope of the pillar, $\\frac{dw}{dx}$, we integrate the equation with respect to $x$:\n$$E I \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\int F(L-x) \\, dx = F\\left(Lx - \\frac{x^{2}}{2}\\right) + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration.\n\nTo find the deflection $w(x)$, we integrate again:\n$$E I w(x) = \\int \\left[ F\\left(Lx - \\frac{x^{2}}{2}\\right) + C_1 \\right] \\, dx = F\\left(\\frac{Lx^{2}}{2} - \\frac{x^{3}}{6}\\right) + C_1 x + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration.\n\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by applying the boundary conditions for a cantilever beam. At the fixed base ($x=0$), both the deflection and the slope must be zero.\n1.  Zero deflection at the base: $w(0)=0$.\n    $$E I w(0) = F\\left(\\frac{L(0)^{2}}{2} - \\frac{(0)^{3}}{6}\\right) + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2=0$$\n2.

We denote this deflection as $\\delta = w(L)$:\n$$\\delta = w(L) = \\frac{F}{E I} \\left(\\frac{L(L)^{2}}{2} - \\frac{L^{3}}{6}\\right) = \\frac{F}{E I} \\left(\\frac{L^{3}}{2} - \\frac{L^{3}}{6}\\right)$$\n$$\\delta = \\frac{F}{E I} \\left(\\frac{3L^{3} - L^{3}}{6}\\right) = \\frac{F}{E I} \\left(\\frac{2L^{3}}{6}\\right) = \\frac{FL^{3}}{3EI}$$\nThe problem provides the geometric identity for the second moment of area of a circular cross-section with radius $r$: $I = \\frac{\\pi r^{4}}{4}$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{FL^{3}}{3E \\left(\\frac{\\pi r^{4}}{4}\\right)} = \\frac{4FL^{3}}{3E\\pi r^{4}}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the tip deflection.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the tip deflection using the provided data:\n- Force $F = 35 \\times 10^{-9}$ N\n- Young's modulus $E = 2.0 \\times 10^{6}$ Pa ($= 2.0 \\times 10^{6}$ N/m$^2$)\n- Pillar radius $r = 1.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n- Pillar height $L = 7.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ m\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{4(35 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{N})(7.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m})^{3}}{3(2.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\text{N}/\\text{m}^{2})\\pi (1.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m})^{4}}$$\n$$\\delta = \\frac{4 \\times 35 \\times 10^{-9} \\times (7.0)^{3} \\times 10^{-18}}{3 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^{6} \\times \\pi \\times (1.5)^{4} \\times 10^{-24}} \\, \\text{m}$$\n$$\\delta = \\frac{140 \\times 343 \\times 10^{-27}}{6.0 \\times \\pi \\times 5.0625 \\times 10^{-18}} \\, \\text{m}$$\n$$\\delta = \\frac{48020 \\times 10^{-27}}{30.375 \\pi \\times 10^{-18}} \\, \\text{m}$$\n$$\\delta \\approx \\frac{4.802 \\times 10^{-23}}{95.426 \\times 10^{-18}} \\, \\text{m} \\approx 0.5032 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in micrometers (µm) and rounded to three significant figures. Since $1 \\, \\text{µm} = 10^{-6} \\, \\text{m}$, the deflection is:\n$$\\delta \\approx 0.503 \\, \\text{µm}$$\n\nFinally, we discuss the scaling of deflection with pillar stiffness and its implications. The stiffness $k$ of the pillar is defined as the force per unit deflection, $k = F/\\delta$. From our derived expression, the stiffness is $k = \\frac{3E\\pi r^{4}}{4L^{3}}$. The deflection is $\\delta = F/k$.\nThe deflection scales with the geometric and material parameters as $\\delta \\propto L^{3}$, $\\delta \\propto E^{-1}$, and $\\delta \\propto r^{-4}$.\nTo achieve high sensitivity for measuring small forces, a large deflection is desirable. This implies that the pillar should be designed to be compliant (i.e., have a low stiffness $k$). Based on the scaling relationships, sensitivity is maximized by:\n- Increasing the pillar height $L$, as deflection scales with $L^{3}$.\n- Using a softer material with a lower Young's modulus $E$, as deflection is inversely proportional to $E$.\n- Decreasing the pillar radius $r$, as deflection is inversely proportional to $r^{-4}$. This is the most dominant parameter.\nTherefore, to detect malignancy-associated forces, which can be subtle, an array of long, thin pillars made of a soft material like PDMS is ideal. Such a configuration amplifies the mechanical signal (the force) into a larger, more easily measurable output (the deflection), enabling the differentiation of cellular phenotypes based on their mechanical footprint.",

The outcome depends on the balance between increased $F$ and accelerated unbinding at the front; with moderate stiffness, the net is often positive $B$, but the model will resolve it quantitatively.\n- Case C (competing, softening to the front): $g_k &lt; 0$ and $g_L &gt; 0$. Stiffness favors the back, ligand favors the front. With a relatively softening substrate and strong ligand increase, $B$ can be positive if haptotaxis dominates.\n- Case D (very high stiffness): Although $g_k &gt; 0$, the exponential unbinding at the front may strongly reduce $p_{\\mathrm{eng}}$, potentially making $T(x_f) &lt; T(x_b)$ and thus $B &lt; 0$, illustrating durotaxis reversal on overly stiff substrates due to slip bonds.\n- Case E (no cues): $g_k = 0$ and $g_L = 0$. Symmetry implies $T(x_f) = T(x_b)$, so $B = 0$.\n\nThe program implements these steps and outputs a single bracketed line with the five $B$ values, each rounded to six decimals, corresponding to Cases A through E.",
