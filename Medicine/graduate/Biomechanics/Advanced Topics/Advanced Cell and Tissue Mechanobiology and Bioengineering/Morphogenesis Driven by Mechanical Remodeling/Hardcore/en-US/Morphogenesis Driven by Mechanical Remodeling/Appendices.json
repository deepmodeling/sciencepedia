The rigid cavity prevents any net macroscopic deformation of the tissue, so the mapping from reference coordinates $\\mathbf{X}$ to current coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$ is constrained to be the identity, implying the total deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}=\\partial \\mathbf{x}/\\partial \\mathbf{X}$ remains $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{I}$ throughout the process.\n\nAssume the finite-strain kinematic framework with multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into elastic and growth parts, $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{F}_{e}\\mathbf{G}$, where $\\mathbf{F}_{e}$ is the elastic deformation gradient.

The multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, $\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{F}_e \\mathbf{G}$, is a standard and widely accepted model (developed by Rodriguez, Hoger, and McCulloch) for separating elastic and inelastic (e.g., growth-related) deformations. The use of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor and the Cauchy–Green tensor are standard definitions. The scenario of constrained growth is a common and important case study in biomechanics.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The provided constraints, $\\mathbf{F}=\\mathbf{I}$ and $\\mathbf{G}=\\gamma \\mathbf{I}$, along with the defining equations for the kinematic quantities, are sufficient to uniquely determine the unknown tensor $\\mathbf{E}_e$.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard terminology from continuum mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, fully specified, and mathematically formalizable. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental kinematic relations provided. The total deformation gradient, $\\mathbf{F}$, is decomposed multiplicatively into an elastic part, $\\mathbf{F}_e$, and a growth part, $\\mathbf{G}$.\n$$\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{F}_e \\mathbf{G}$$\nThe problem states that due to the rigid external cavity, the net macroscopic deformation is zero. This means the mapping from the reference configuration (coordinates $\\mathbf{X}$) to the current configuration (coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$) is the identity map, $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{X}$. The total deformation gradient is therefore the identity tensor, $\\mathbf{I}$.\n$$\\mathbf{F} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\mathbf{X}} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{X}}{\\partial \\mathbf{X}} = \\mathbf{I}$$\nThe growth is isotropic and uniform, described by the growth tensor $\\mathbf{G}$:\n$$\\mathbf{G} = \\gamma \\mathbf{I}$$\nwhere $\\gamma > 0$ is a scalar constant representing the linear growth factor and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the second-order identity tensor.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mathbf{F}$ and $\\mathbf{G}$ into the multiplicative decomposition gives:\n$$\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{F}_e (\\gamma \\mathbf{I})$$\nSince $\\gamma$ is a scalar, it commutes with the tensor $\\mathbf{F}_e$.\n$$\\mathbf{I} = \\gamma \\mathbf{F}_e$$\nTo solve for the elastic deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}_e$, we can multiply both sides by the inverse of $\\gamma$. Since $\\gamma > 0$ is given, its inverse exists.\n$$\\mathbf{F}_e = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\mathbf{I}$$\nThis result indicates that the elastic deformation is a uniform isotropic compression (if $\\gamma>1$) or tension (if $0\\gamma1$) that exactly counteracts the growth to maintain the overall shape and size.\n\nNext, we derive the elastic Green–Lagrange strain tensor, $\\mathbf{E}_e$. It is defined in terms of the elastic right Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{C}_e$. The definition of $\\mathbf{C}_e$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{C}_e = \\mathbf{F}_e^T \\mathbf{F}_e$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{F}_e^T$ is the transpose of $\\mathbf{F}_e$.

This final exercise introduces the concept of active mechanical remodeling, where a tissue dynamically adjusts its internal stress towards a homeostatic target. You will perform a linear stability analysis on a model that couples elasticity with a stress-feedback law to derive the system's dispersion relation, $\\lambda(q)$, revealing how the tissue responds to perturbations over time .",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional homogeneous epithelial tissue adhered to a rigid substrate and undergoing morphogenesis driven by mechanical remodeling. Assume the tissue is overdamped so that inertia is negligible, and consider small deformations. Let the displacement field be $u(x,t)$ and the total Cauchy stress be $\\sigma(x,t)$. The substrate exerts a viscous drag characterized by a positive coefficient $\\xi>0$, and the bulk tissue obeys linear elasticity with Young’s modulus $E>0$ under small strain, so that the elastic stress is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{el}}(x,t)=E\\,\\varepsilon(x,t)$ where the strain is $\\varepsilon(x,t)=\\partial_{x}u(x,t)$. The tissue also generates an active stress $\\sigma_{a}(x,t)$ due to cellular contractility and cytoskeletal activity. The total stress is the sum of elastic and active contributions, $\\sigma(x,t)=\\sigma_{\\mathrm{el}}(x,t)+\\sigma_{a}(x,t)$.\n\nMechanical remodeling implements a stress feedback that relaxes the tissue toward a target homeostatic stress $\\sigma^{\\ast}$ according to the first-order ordinary differential equation $\\partial_{t}\\sigma_{a}(x,t)=-k\\big(\\sigma(x,t)-\\sigma^{\\ast}\\big)$, where $k>0$ is a remodeling rate constant. The force balance in the overdamped limit equates the divergence of stress to substrate drag, $\\xi\\,\\partial_{t}u(x,t)=\\partial_{x}\\sigma(x,t)$.\n\nStarting from these principles, perform a linear stability analysis about the spatially homogeneous base state with $u_{0}(x)=0$, $\\varepsilon_{0}(x)=0$, $\\sigma_{a0}=\\sigma^{\\ast}$, and $\\sigma_{0}=\\sigma^{\\ast}$. Consider normal-mode perturbations of the form $\\delta u(x,t)=\\hat{u}\\,\\exp\\big(i q x+\\lambda t\\big)$ and $\\delta\\sigma_{a}(x,t)=\\hat{\\sigma}_{a}\\,\\exp\\big(i q x+\\lambda t\\big)$, where $q$ is a real wavenumber and $\\lambda$ is the complex growth rate. Derive the dispersion relation $\\lambda(q)$ for the coupled perturbations and determine the condition on $E$, $\\xi$, and $k$ under which stress perturbations relax exponentially in time (i.e., $\\operatorname{Re}\\lambda0$ for the relaxing mode).\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression giving the two branches of $\\lambda(q)$ as a function of $q$, $E$, $\\xi$, and $k$. Express the two branches as a single row matrix. Do not include units in the final answer box.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Displacement field: $u(x,t)$\n- Total Cauchy stress: $\\sigma(x,t)$\n- Substrate viscous drag coefficient: $\\xi > 0$\n- Tissue Young’s modulus: $E > 0$\n- Strain: $\\varepsilon(x,t) = \\partial_x u(x,t)$\n- Elastic stress: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{el}}(x,t) = E\\,\\varepsilon(x,t)$\n- Active stress: $\\sigma_{a}(x,t)$\n- Total stress composition: $\\sigma(x,t) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{el}}(x,t) + \\sigma_{a}(x,t)$\n- Target homeostatic stress: $\\sigma^{\\ast}$\n- Remodeling rate constant: $k > 0$\n- Active stress dynamics: $\\partial_{t}\\sigma_{a}(x,t)=-k\\big(\\sigma(x,t)-\\sigma^{\\ast}\\big)$\n- Force balance (overdamped limit): $\\xi\\,\\partial_{t}u(x,t)=\\partial_{x}\\sigma(x,t)$\n- Homogeneous base state: $u_{0}(x)=0$, $\\varepsilon_{0}(x)=0$, $\\sigma_{a0}=\\sigma^{\\ast}$, $\\sigma_{0}=\\sigma^{\\ast}$\n- Perturbation form: $\\delta u(x,t)=\\hat{u}\\,\\exp(i q x+\\lambda t)$, $\\delta\\sigma_{a}(x,t)=\\hat{\\sigma}_{a}\\,\\exp(i q x+\\lambda t)$, where $q$ is a real wavenumber and $\\lambda$ is a complex growth rate.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard continuum mechanics model for an active biological tissue.

The model is a simplification, but it does not violate any fundamental principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-defined. It provides a complete set of governing PDES, parameters, and a base state for a linear stability analysis. The goal is clearly stated.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, using standard nomenclature from physics and engineering. It is free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, self-contained, and well-posed. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Dispersion Relation\nThe system is described by two coupled governing equations. First, the active stress dynamics:\n$$ \\partial_{t}\\sigma_{a} = -k(\\sigma - \\sigma^{\\ast}) $$\nSubstituting $\\sigma = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{el}} + \\sigma_{a} = E\\,\\partial_x u + \\sigma_a$, we get:\n$$ \\partial_{t}\\sigma_{a} = -k(E\\,\\partial_x u + \\sigma_a - \\sigma^{\\ast}) $$\nSecond, the force balance equation:\n$$ \\xi\\,\\partial_{t}u = \\partial_{x}\\sigma $$\nSubstituting for $\\sigma$ again, we have:\n$$ \\xi\\,\\partial_{t}u = \\partial_{x}(E\\,\\partial_x u + \\sigma_a) = E\\,\\partial_{xx}u + \\partial_{x}\\sigma_a $$\n\nWe perform a linear stability analysis around the homogeneous base state: $u_0 = 0$ and $\\sigma_{a0} = \\sigma^{\\ast}$. Let's introduce small perturbations:\n$$ u(x,t) = u_0 + \\delta u(x,t) = \\delta u(x,t) $$\n$$ \\sigma_a(x,t) = \\sigma_{a0} + \\delta \\sigma_a(x,t) = \\sigma^{\\ast} + \\delta \\sigma_a(x,t) $$\n\nSubstituting these into the governing equations and keeping only terms of first order in the perturbations $\\delta u$ and $\\delta\\sigma_a$ yields the linearized equations:\n1. From the active stress dynamics:\n$$ \\partial_t(\\sigma^{\\ast} + \\delta\\sigma_a) = -k(E\\,\\partial_x(\\delta u) + (\\sigma^{\\ast} + \\delta\\sigma_a) - \\sigma^{\\ast}) $$\n$$ \\partial_t\\delta\\sigma_a = -k(E\\,\\partial_x\\delta u + \\delta\\sigma_a) $$\n$$ \\partial_t\\delta\\sigma_a + k\\,\\delta\\sigma_a + kE\\,\\partial_x\\delta u = 0 $$\n2. From the force balance:\n$$ \\xi\\,\\partial_t\\delta u = E\\,\\partial_{xx}\\delta u + \\partial_x(\\sigma^{\\ast} + \\delta\\sigma_a) $$\n$$ \\xi\\,\\partial_t\\delta u - E\\,\\partial_{xx}\\delta u - \\partial_x\\delta\\sigma_a = 0 $$\n\nNext, we apply the normal-mode ansatz for the perturbations:\n$$ \\delta u(x,t) = \\hat{u}\\,\\exp(i q x + \\lambda t) $$\n$$ \\delta\\sigma_a(x,t) = \\hat{\\sigma}_a\\,\\exp(i q x + \\lambda t) $$\nSubstituting these forms into the linearized PDEs converts them into a system of linear algebraic equations for the amplitudes $\\hat{u}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$. The derivatives become multiplications: $\\partial_t \\to \\lambda$ and $\\partial_x \\to iq$.\n\n1. The first equation becomes:\n$$ \\lambda\\hat{\\sigma}_a + k\\hat{\\sigma}_a + kE(iq)\\hat{u} = 0 $$\n$$ (iqkE)\\hat{u} + (\\lambda+k)\\hat{\\sigma}_a = 0 $$\n2. The second equation becomes:\n$$ \\xi\\lambda\\hat{u} - E(iq)^2\\hat{u} - (iq)\\hat{\\sigma}_a = 0 $$\n$$ (\\xi\\lambda + Eq^2)\\hat{u} - iq\\hat{\\sigma}_a = 0 $$\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form as:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} iqkE  \\lambda+k \\\\ \\xi\\lambda+Eq^2  -iq \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{u} \\\\ \\hat{\\sigma}_a \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor a non-trivial solution $(\\hat{u}, \\hat{\\sigma}_a) \\neq (0,0)$, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero. This condition yields the dispersion relation for $\\lambda(q)$:\n$$ \\det\\begin{pmatrix} iqkE  \\lambda+k \\\\ \\xi\\lambda+Eq^2  -iq \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (iqkE)(-iq) - (\\lambda+k)(\\xi\\lambda+Eq^2) = 0 $$\n$$ -i^2q^2kE - \\left(\\xi\\lambda^2 + Eq^2\\lambda + k\\xi\\lambda + kEq^2\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ q^2kE - \\xi\\lambda^2 - (Eq^2+k\\xi)\\lambda - kEq^2 = 0 $$\nThe terms $q^2kE$ and $-kEq^2$ cancel each other out:\n$$ -\\xi\\lambda^2 - (Eq^2+k\\xi)\\lambda = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda \\left(-\\xi\\lambda - (Eq^2+k\\xi)\\right) = 0 $$\nThis characteristic equation gives two distinct branches for the dispersion relation $\\lambda(q)$:\n\nThe first branch is:\n$$ \\lambda_1(q) = 0 $$\nThis is a neutrally stable mode that exists for all wavenumbers $q$. It reflects the fact that the system possesses a continuum of stationary states. Any static deformation can be maintained without net stress if the active stress remodels to perfectly counteract the elastic stress, i.e., $\\sigma_a(x) = \\sigma^\\ast - E\\varepsilon(x)$. The $\\lambda=0$ mode corresponds to perturbations that move the system between these degenerate steady states.\n\nThe second branch is:\n$$ -\\xi\\lambda_2 - (Eq^2+k\\xi) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda_2(q) = -\\frac{Eq^2 + k\\xi}{\\xi} = -k - \\frac{E}{\\xi}q^2 $$\nThis is the relaxing mode.\n\nThe problem asks for the condition under which the relaxing mode shows exponential decay, i.e., $\\operatorname{Re}(\\lambda)  0$. For the second branch, $\\lambda_2$ is always real. We need to check the condition $\\lambda_2  0$:\n$$ -k - \\frac{E}{\\xi}q^2  0 $$\n$$ k + \\frac{E}{\\xi}q^2  0 $$\nThe problem states that $E>0$, $\\xi>0$, and $k>0$. The wavenumber $q$ is real, so $q^2 \\ge 0$. Therefore, the term $\\frac{E}{\\xi}q^2$ is non-negative. The sum $k + \\frac{E}{\\xi}q^2$ is strictly positive for any $q$. Consequently, $\\lambda_2(q)$ is always negative. The relaxing mode is thus unconditionally stable and decays for all physical parameter values, with no additional constraints on $E$, $\\xi$, and $k$.\n\nThe two branches of the dispersion relation $\\lambda(q)$ are $\\lambda_1=0$ and $\\lambda_2 = -k - \\frac{E}{\\xi}q^2$.",
