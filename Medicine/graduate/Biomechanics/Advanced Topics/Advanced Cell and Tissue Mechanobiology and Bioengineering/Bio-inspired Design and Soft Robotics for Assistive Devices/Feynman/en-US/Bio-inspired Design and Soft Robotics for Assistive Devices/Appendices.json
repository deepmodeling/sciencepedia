Unlike traditional rigid materials, the elastomers used in soft robotics exhibit large, nonlinear deformations that cannot be captured by simple linear elastic models. This practice exercise challenges you to work with a classic hyperelastic constitutive law, the Mooney–Rivlin model, to derive the stress response of a soft strap under tension from first principles. Mastering this type of derivation is critical for developing predictive models of soft assistive devices.",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics. We are asked to derive the axial Cauchy stress for an incompressible isotropic hyperelastic material described by a Mooney-Rivlin model under uniaxial tension and then compute its value for a given stretch and material parameters.\n\nLet the coordinate system be aligned with the principal directions of stretch. The uniaxial tension is applied along the $x_1$ axis. The deformation gradient tensor, $\\mathbf{F}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIn this case of uniaxial tension, the stretch in the loading direction is $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda$. Due to the symmetry of the material and loading, the lateral stretches are equal, so $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3$.\n\nThe material is specified as incompressible, which imposes the kinematic constraint $\\det(\\mathbf{F}) = J = 1$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = \\lambda \\lambda_2^2 = 1\n$$\nSolving for the lateral stretch $\\lambda_2$ gives:\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = \\lambda^{-1/2}\n$$\nThe deformation gradient tensor can thus be written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1/2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda^{-1/2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, $\\mathbf{B}$, is defined as $\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{F}^T$.

The solution proceeds by calculating the tip deflection under each theory and then finding their difference.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of the problem is to compare the tip deflection of a cantilever beam under a uniform load, as predicted by two different beam theories.\n\nFirst, we calculate some common parameters.\nThe uniform load per unit length, $q$, is:\n$$q = \\frac{F_{\\text{total}}}{L} = \\frac{6\\,\\text{N}}{0.08\\,\\text{m}} = 75\\,\\text{N/m}$$\nThe cross-sectional area, $A$, is:\n$$A = b h = (0.02\\,\\text{m})(0.02\\,\\text{m}) = 4 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}^2$$\nThe second moment of area (area moment of inertia) of the rectangular cross-section, $I$, is:\n$$I = \\frac{b h^3}{12} = \\frac{(0.02\\,\\text{m})(0.02\\,\\text{m})^3}{12} = \\frac{(0.02)(8 \\times 10^{-6})}{12}\\,\\text{m}^4 = \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-7}}{12}\\,\\text{m}^4$$\n\n#### (i) Shear-Undeformable (Euler-Bernoulli) Beam Theory\nThis theory neglects shear strain. The deflection is due entirely to bending. The governing differential equation relates the beam's curvature to the bending moment $M(x)$:\n$$EI \\frac{d^2v}{dx^2} = M(x)$$\nFor a cantilever beam clamped at $x=0$ and subjected to a downward uniform load $q$, the bending moment at a distance $x$ from the clamp is:\n$$M(x) = -\\frac{q(L-x)^2}{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the governing equation and integrating twice with respect to $x$, applying the boundary conditions for a cantilever beam ($v(0)=0$ for zero deflection and $\\frac{dv}{dx}(0)=0$ for zero slope at the clamp), yields the deflection curve $v(x)$. The magnitude of the tip deflection, $\\delta_{EB}$, at $x=L$ is a standard result:\n$$\\delta_{EB} = \\frac{qL^4}{8EI}$$\nWe can now calculate this value:\n$$E = 0.8 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}$$\n$$I = \\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-7}}{12}\\,\\text{m}^4$$\nThe flexural rigidity $EI$ is:\n$$EI = (0.8 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}) \\left(\\frac{1.6 \\times 10^{-7}}{12}\\,\\text{m}^4\\right) = \\frac{0.128}{12}\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$$\nSubstituting the values into the deflection formula:\n$$\\delta_{EB} = \\frac{(75\\,\\text{N/m})(0.08\\,\\text{m})^4}{8 \\left(\\frac{0.128}{12}\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2\\right)} = \\frac{75 \\times (4.096 \\times 10^{-5})}{8 \\times (\\frac{0.128}{12})}\\,\\text{m} = \\frac{0.003072}{0.08533...}\\,\\text{m} = 0.036\\,\\text{m}$$\nSo, the tip deflection predicted by the Euler-Bernoulli theory is $\\delta_{EB} = 36\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\n#### (ii) Shear-Deformable (Timoshenko) Beam Theory\nThis theory accounts for deflections due to both bending and shear. For a statically determinate beam, the total deflection can be found by superposing the bending and shear components:\n$$\\delta_T = \\delta_b + \\delta_s$$\nThe bending deflection component, $\\delta_b$, is identical to the Euler-Bernoulli deflection: $\\delta_b = \\delta_{EB} = \\frac{qL^4}{8EI}$.\nThe shear deflection component, $\\delta_s$, is found by integrating the shear strain along the beam's length. The local slope due to shear is $\\frac{dv_s}{dx} = \\gamma$, where $\\gamma$ is the shear strain. The constitutive relation for shear is $V(x) = kAG\\gamma$, where $V(x)$ is the shear force, $k$ is the shear correction factor, and $G$ is the shear modulus.\nThe shear force at a location $x$ is:\n$$V(x) = q(L-x)$$\nThus, the slope due to shear is:\n$$\\frac{dv_s}{dx} = \\frac{V(x)}{kAG} = \\frac{q(L-x)}{kAG}$$\nIntegrating from the clamp ($x=0$) to the tip ($x=L$) with the boundary condition $v_s(0)=0$:\n$$\\delta_s = v_s(L) = \\int_0^L \\frac{q(L-x)}{kAG} dx = \\frac{q}{kAG} \\left[Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right]_0^L = \\frac{q}{kAG}\\left(L^2 - \\frac{L^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{qL^2}{2kAG}$$\nTo calculate $\\delta_s$, we first need the shear modulus, $G$:\n$$G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} = \\frac{0.8 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}}{2(1+0.49)} = \\frac{0.8 \\times 10^6}{2.98}\\,\\text{Pa}$$\nNow we compute the shear component of the tip deflection:\n$$\\delta_s = \\frac{(75\\,\\text{N/m})(0.08\\,\\text{m})^2}{2(5/6)(4 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}^2)\\left(\\frac{0.8 \\times 10^6}{2.98}\\,\\text{Pa}\\right)}$$\n$$\\delta_s = \\frac{75 \\times 0.0064}{2 \\times (5/6) \\times 4 \\times 10^{-4} \\times (268456.37...)}\\,\\text{m}$$\n$$\\delta_s = \\frac{0.48}{\\frac{10}{6} \\times (107.38...)}\\,\\text{m} = \\frac{0.48}{178.97...}\\,\\text{m} = 0.0026820...\\,\\text{m}$$\nSo, the deflection due to shear is $\\delta_s \\approx 2.682\\,\\text{mm}$.\nThe total tip deflection in the Timoshenko model is $\\delta_T = \\delta_{EB} + \\delta_s = 36\\,\\text{mm} + 2.682\\,\\text{mm} = 38.682\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\n### Tip Positioning Error\nThe tip positioning error is defined as the absolute difference between the two predictions:\n$$\\Delta\\delta = |\\delta_T - \\delta_{EB}| = |(\\delta_b + \\delta_s) - \\delta_b| = \\delta_s$$\nThe error is therefore equal to the deflection caused by shear.\n$$\\Delta\\delta = 0.0026820...\\,\\text{m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in millimeters, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta\\delta = 2.6820...\\,\\text{mm} \\approx 2.682\\,\\text{mm}$$",
