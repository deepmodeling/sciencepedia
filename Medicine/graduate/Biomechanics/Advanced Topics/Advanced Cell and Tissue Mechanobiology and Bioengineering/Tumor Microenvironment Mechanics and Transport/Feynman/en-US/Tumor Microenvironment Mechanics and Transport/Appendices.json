It is a valid problem. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Concentration Profile\nThe problem concerns steady-state diffusion with a reaction (consumption) in a spherically symmetric domain. The governing principle is mass conservation. For a differential spherical shell of radius $r$ and thickness $dr$, at steady state, the net rate of nutrient diffusion into the shell must equal the rate of nutrient consumption within the shell.\n\nThe mass conservation equation in spherical coordinates under these assumptions is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 J_r \\right) = -q $$\nwhere $J_r$ is the radial nutrient flux and $-q$ is the sink term representing consumption.\n\nAccording to Fick’s first law of diffusion, the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$ J_r = -D \\frac{dc}{dr} $$\nSubstituting Fick's law into the conservation equation, and assuming $D$ is constant, we get:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\left(-D \\frac{dc}{dr}\\right) \\right) = -q $$\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{q}{D} r^2 $$\nThis is the governing ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $c(r)$. We integrate it twice to find the general solution.\n\nIntegrating once with respect to $r$:\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r^3 + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant.\n\nTo solve for $C_1$, we apply a boundary condition at the center of the spheroid ($r=0$). Due to radial symmetry, the concentration gradient must be zero at the center to avoid an infinite flux source or sink, i.e., $\\left.\\frac{dc}{dr}\\right|_{r=0} = 0$. Rewriting the above equation as $\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r + \\frac{C_1}{r^2}$, we see that for the gradient to be finite (and zero) at $r=0$, we must have $C_1=0$.\n\nWith $C_1=0$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{q}{3D} r $$\nIntegrating a second time:\n$$ c(r) = \\int \\frac{q}{3D} r \\, dr = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant.\n\nTo find $C_2$, we use the boundary condition at the spheroid surface, $c(R) = c_s$:\n$$ c(R) = c_s = \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 + C_2 $$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = c_s - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 $$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the expression for $c(r)$, we obtain the nutrient concentration profile:\n$$ c(r) = \\frac{q}{6D} r^2 + c_s - \\frac{q}{6D} R^2 $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ c(r) = c_s - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - r^2) $$\n\n### Calculation of the Necrotic Core Radius\nThe necrotic core radius, $r_n$, is defined by the condition $c(r_n) = c_{\\text{crit}}$. We substitute this into the derived concentration profile:\n$$ c_{\\text{crit}} = c_s - \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - r_n^2) $$\nNow, we solve this algebraic equation for $r_n$.\n$$ \\frac{q}{6D} (R^2 - r_n^2) = c_s - c_{\\text{crit}} $$\n$$ R^2 - r_n^2 = \\frac{6D(c_s - c_{\\text{crit}})}{q} $$\n$$ r_n^2 = R^2 - \\frac{6D(c_s - c_{\\text{crit}})}{q} $$\nThe problem defines the parameter $\\lambda$ as:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{q}{6 D \\left(c_{s} - c_{\\text{crit}}\\right)}} $$\nSquaring this definition gives:\n$$ \\lambda^2 = \\frac{q}{6 D \\left(c_{s} - c_{\\text{crit}}\\right)} $$\nThe term in our expression for $r_n^2$ is the reciprocal of $\\lambda^2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = \\frac{6 D \\left(c_{s} - c_{\\text{crit}}\\right)}{q} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $r_n^2$:\n$$ r_n^2 = R^2 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} $$\nFinally, taking the square root gives the expression for the necrotic core radius, $r_n$. We take the positive root since a radius must be non-negative.\n$$ r_n = \\sqrt{R^2 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}} $$\nThis expression is the closed-form analytic solution for $r_n$ in terms of $R$ and $\\lambda$, valid for the case where a necrotic core exists ($R^2 > 1/\\lambda^2$).",
