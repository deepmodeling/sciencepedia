We evaluate the expression for $\\tau_{rz}(r)$ at $r=R$:\n$$\n\\tau_w = \\tau_{rz}|_{r=R} = -\\frac{2\\mu U R}{R^2} = -\\frac{2\\mu U}{R}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the fluid drag force on the wall is directed opposite to the flow (in the negative $z$-direction).\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into the expression for $\\tau_w$:\n-   $\\mu = 3.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{Pa} \\cdot \\text{s}$\n-   $U = 1.2 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$\n-   $R = 9.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\text{m}$\n\n$$\n\\tau_w = -\\frac{2 (3.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.2 \\times 10^{-1})}{9.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = -\\frac{7.68 \\times 10^{-4}}{9.0 \\times 10^{-4}} \\ \\text{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_w = -0.85333... \\ \\text{Pa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed, we get:\n$$\n\\tau_w \\approx -0.8533 \\ \\text{Pa}\n$$\nThe second objective is to estimate the mechanotransduction signaling amplitude, $A$.

            "problem": "An optical tweezer experiment is used to probe mechanotransduction in a membrane-tethered mechanosensitive ion channel. The optical trap can be modeled as a harmonic potential with stiffness $k_{\\mathrm{trap}}$, and the membrane–protein tether connected to the bead behaves elastically with stiffness $k_{\\mathrm{m}}$ that depends on the channel state: $k_{\\mathrm{m,closed}}$ when the channel is closed and $k_{\\mathrm{m,open}}$ when the channel is open. The gate opens irreversibly when the tensile force transmitted through the tether reaches a threshold $F_{\\mathrm{g}}$. The experiment proceeds quasi-statically so that inertial and viscous forces can be neglected and mechanical equilibrium holds at every instant.\n\nPart A (calibration): A bead is displaced within the trap by a measured distance $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{bead}}$ relative to the trap center. Using only core definitions (force as the negative gradient of potential energy for a harmonic trap and the definition of work), compute the optical force on the bead.\n\nPart B (gating work): The trap center is held fixed, and the sample stage is advanced by a prescribed displacement $s$ from $s=0$ to a final $s=s_{\\mathrm{f}}$. Because the trap and tether are mechanically in series, let $x_{\\mathrm{t}}$ be the trap extension and $x_{\\mathrm{m}}$ be the tether extension; force balance requires $F = k_{\\mathrm{trap}} x_{\\mathrm{t}} = k_{\\mathrm{m}} x_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and geometric compatibility requires $s = x_{\\mathrm{t}} + x_{\\mathrm{m}}$. Before gating, $k_{\\mathrm{m}} = k_{\\mathrm{m,closed}}$; after the force reaches $F_{\\mathrm{g}}$, the channel opens and $k_{\\mathrm{m}}$ instantaneously changes to $k_{\\mathrm{m,open}}$. Assume the force is continuous at the moment of gating and that the loading remains quasi-static. Derive from first principles the force–displacement relation $F(s)$ throughout the motion, determine the stage displacement $s_{\\mathrm{g}}$ at which gating occurs, and compute the total external work $W = \\int_{0}^{s_{\\mathrm{f}}} F(s)\\, ds$ done by advancing the stage.\n\nUse the following parameter values:\n- $k_{\\mathrm{trap}} = 0.08$ picoNewton per nanometer (pN/nm),\n- $k_{\\mathrm{m,closed}} = 0.12$ pN/nm,\n- $k_{\\mathrm{m,open}} = 0.03$ pN/nm,\n- $F_{\\mathrm{g}} = 4.0$ picoNewton (pN),\n- $s_{\\mathrm{f}} = 150$ nanometer (nm),\n- $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{bead}} = 25$ nanometer (nm).\n\nExpress the force from Part A in picoNewton (pN) and the work from Part B in picoNewton–nanometer (pN·nm).

The model of an optical trap as a harmonic potential and the treatment of the molecular tether as an elastic spring are well-established, valid approximations in biophysics. The concept of force-induced conformational change (gating) is central to mechanotransduction. The parameter values are physically realistic for such experiments.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with two distinct parts. All necessary information, including physical constants, boundary conditions, and behavioral rules (e.g., quasi-static motion, force continuity), is provided to determine a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\nConclusion: The problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. There are no identifiable flaws. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part A: Calibration Force Calculation\n\nThe problem requires computing the optical force on the bead using the definition of force as the negative gradient of potential energy, where the potential energy itself is derived from the definition of work.\n\nThe potential energy, $U$, stored in a harmonic trap when a bead is displaced by a distance $x$ from the trap's center is equal to the work done by an external force, $F_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, to move the bead from the center ($x=0$) to that position. The trap exerts a restoring force $F_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x') = -k_{\\mathrm{trap}} x'$. To hold the bead at a position $x'$, the external force must balance the trap force: $F_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x') = -F_{\\mathrm{trap}}(x') = k_{\\mathrm{trap}} x'$.\n\nThe work done, and thus the potential energy, is the integral of this external force over the displacement:\n$$U(x) = \\int_0^x F_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x') \\, dx' = \\int_0^x k_{\\mathrm{trap}} x' \\, dx' = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{trap}} x^2$$\n\nThe optical force, $F$, exerted by the trap on the bead is the negative gradient of this potential energy. In one dimension, this is:\n$$F(x) = -\\frac{dU}{dx} = -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{trap}} x^2\\right) = -k_{\\mathrm{trap}} x$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the force is restorative, directed towards the trap's center. The magnitude of the force is $|F| = k_{\\mathrm{trap}} |x|$.\n\nFor a given displacement $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{bead}}$, the magnitude of the optical force on the bead, which we denote $F_A$, is:\n$$F_A = k_{\\mathrm{trap}} \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{bead}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$F_A = (0.08 \\, \\text{pN/nm}) \\times (25 \\, \\text{nm}) = 2.0 \\, \\text{pN}$$\nAs requested, we express this to four significant figures, which gives $F_A = 2.000 \\, \\text{pN}$.\n\n### Part B: Gating Work Calculation\n\nThis part requires deriving the force-displacement relation $F(s)$, finding the gating displacement $s_{\\mathrm{g}}$, and calculating the total work $W = \\int_{0}^{s_{\\mathrm{f}}} F(s) ds$.\n\n**Force-Displacement Relation $F(s)$**\n\nThe system is composed of the trap and the tether, acting as two springs in series. The total displacement $s$ of the stage is the sum of the individual extensions of the trap, $x_{\\mathrm{t}}$, and the tether, $x_{\\mathrm{m}}$: $s = x_{\\mathrm{t}} + x_{\\mathrm{m}}$. Since they are in series, the force $F$ is the same in both components: $F = k_{\\mathrm{trap}} x_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and $F = k_{\\mathrm{m}} x_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\nWe can express the individual extensions in terms of the force:\n$$x_{\\mathrm{t}} = \\frac{F}{k_{\\mathrm{trap}}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{F}{k_{\\mathrm{m}}}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the geometric compatibility equation:\n$$s = \\frac{F}{k_{\\mathrm{trap}}} + \\frac{F}{k_{\\mathrm{m}}} = F \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{trap}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)$$\n\nThis can be written as $F = k_{\\mathrm{eff}} s$, where $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective spring constant of the series system:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{trap}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trap}} k_{\\mathrm{m}}}{k_{\\mathrm{trap}} + k_{\\mathrm{m}}}$$\n\nThe tether's stiffness, $k_{\\mathrm{m}}$, changes at the gating force $F_{\\mathrm{g}}$. This defines two regimes for the loading process.\n\n**Regime 1: Pre-gating ($0 \\le F < F_{\\mathrm{g}}$)**\n\nBefore gating, the channel is closed, so $k_{\\mathrm{m}} = k_{\\mathrm{m,closed}}$. The effective stiffness is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{eff,1}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trap}} k_{\\mathrm{m,closed}}}{k_{\\mathrm{trap}} + k_{\\mathrm{m,closed}}} = \\frac{(0.08)(0.12)}{0.08 + 0.12} = \\frac{0.0096}{0.20} = 0.048 \\, \\text{pN/nm}$$\nThe force-displacement relation is $F(s) = k_{\\mathrm{eff,1}} s$.\n\nGating occurs when $F = F_{\\mathrm{g}} = 4.0 \\, \\text{pN}$. The corresponding stage displacement, $s_{\\mathrm{g}}$, is:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{g}} = \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{g}}}{k_{\\mathrm{eff,1}}} = \\frac{4.0 \\, \\text{pN}}{0.048 \\, \\text{pN/nm}} = \\frac{250}{3} \\, \\text{nm} \\approx 83.33 \\, \\text{nm}$$\nSince $s_{\\mathrm{g}} \\approx 83.33 \\, \\text{nm}$ is less than $s_{\\mathrm{f}} = 150 \\, \\text{nm}$, the gating event occurs during the experiment.\n\n**Regime 2: Post-gating ($F \\ge F_{\\mathrm{g}}$)**\n\nFor $s > s_{\\mathrm{g}}$, the channel is open, and its stiffness is $k_{\\mathrm{m}} = k_{\\mathrm{m,open}}$. The new effective stiffness is:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{eff,2}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{trap}} k_{\\mathrm{m,open}}}{k_{\\mathrm{trap}} + k_{\\mathrm{m,open}}} = \\frac{(0.08)(0.03)}{0.08 + 0.03} = \\frac{0.0024}{0.11} = \\frac{6}{275} \\, \\text{pN/nm}$$\nThe force is continuous at $s=s_{\\mathrm{g}}$. For $s > s_{\\mathrm{g}}$, the force increases from the point $(s_{\\mathrm{g}}, F_{\\mathrm{g}})$ with the new slope $k_{\\mathrm{eff,2}}$. The force-displacement relation is given by the point-slope form of a line:\n$$F(s) - F_{\\mathrm{g}} = k_{\\mathrm{eff,2}} (s - s_{\\mathrm{g}})$$\n$$F(s) = F_{\\mathrm{g}} + k_{\\mathrm{eff,2}} (s - s_{\\mathrm{g}}) \\quad \\text{for } s > s_{\\mathrm{g}}$$\n\n**Total Work Calculation**\n\nThe total external work $W$ done by advancing the stage from $s=0$ to $s=s_{\\mathrm{f}}$ is the integral of the force $F(s)$ over the displacement:\n$$W = \\int_0^{s_{\\mathrm{f}}} F(s) \\, ds = \\int_0^{s_{\\mathrm{g}}} F(s) \\, ds + \\int_{s_{\\mathrm{g}}}^{s_{\\mathrm{f}}} F(s) \\, ds$$\n\nThe first integral, $W_1$, corresponds to the work done before gating (a triangular area on the $F-s$ plot):\n$$W_1 = \\int_0^{s_{\\mathrm{g}}} k_{\\mathrm{eff,1}} s \\, ds = \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eff,1}} s_{\\mathrm{g}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\mathrm{g}} s_{\\mathrm{g}}$$\n$$W_1 = \\frac{1}{2} (4.0 \\, \\text{pN}) \\left(\\frac{250}{3} \\, \\text{nm}\\right) = \\frac{500}{3} \\, \\text{pN}\\cdot\\text{nm}$$\n\nThe second integral, $W_2$, is the work done after gating (a trapezoidal area on the $F-s$ plot):\n$$W_2 = \\int_{s_{\\mathrm{g}}}^{s_{\\mathrm{f}}} [F_{\\mathrm{g}} + k_{\\mathrm{eff,2}} (s - s_{\\mathrm{g}})] \\, ds$$\nThis area can be computed as the sum of a rectangle of height $F_{\\mathrm{g}}$ and a triangle:\n$$W_2 = F_{\\mathrm{g}}(s_{\\mathrm{f}} - s_{\\mathrm{g}}) + \\frac{1}{2} k_{\\mathrm{eff,2}} (s_{\\mathrm{f}} - s_{\\mathrm{g}})^2$$\nThe displacement in this regime is $s_{\\mathrm{f}} - s_{\\mathrm{g}} = 150 - \\frac{250}{3} = \\frac{450-250}{3} = \\frac{200}{3} \\, \\text{nm}$.\n$$W_2 = (4.0 \\, \\text{pN})\\left(\\frac{200}{3} \\, \\text{nm}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{6}{275} \\, \\frac{\\text{pN}}{\\text{nm}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{200}{3} \\, \\text{nm}\\right)^2$$\n$$W_2 = \\frac{800}{3} + \\frac{3}{275} \\left(\\frac{40000}{9}\\right) = \\frac{800}{3} + \\frac{40000}{3 \\times 275} = \\frac{800}{3} + \\frac{1600}{33}$$\n$$W_2 = \\frac{8800}{33} + \\frac{1600}{33} = \\frac{10400}{33} \\, \\text{pN}\\cdot\\text{nm}$$\n\nThe total work is the sum of $W_1$ and $W_2$:\n$$W = W_1 + W_2 = \\frac{500}{3} + \\frac{10400}{33} = \\frac{5500}{33} + \\frac{10400}{33} = \\frac{15900}{33} = \\frac{5300}{11} \\, \\text{pN}\\cdot\\text{nm}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$W \\approx 481.8181... \\, \\text{pN}\\cdot\\text{nm}$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the total work is $W = 481.8 \\, \\text{pN}\\cdot\\text{nm}$.\n\n### Summary of Results\n- Force from Part A: $F_A = 2.000 \\, \\text{pN}$.\n- Work from Part B: $W = 481.8 \\, \\text{pN}\\cdot\\text{nm}$.\n\nThe final answer is a row vector containing these two values.",

We are tasked with deriving the probability $p_H(F)$ that the bond ruptures via dissociation from the high-affinity state $H$, and then to compute the force $F_{1/2}$ at which this probability is exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFirst, let us formally define the transition rates, which are functions of the applied force $F$:\n- Dissociation from $L$: $k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F) = k_{\\mathrm{off},L}^{0} \\exp\\big(\\frac{F x_{L}}{k_{B}T}\\big)$\n- Dissociation from $H$: $k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F) = k_{\\mathrm{off},H}^{0} \\exp\\big(\\frac{F x_{H}}{k_{B}T}\\big)$\n- Transition from $L$ to $H$: $k_{LH}(F) = k_{LH}^{0} \\exp\\big(\\frac{F \\delta_{LH}}{k_{B}T}\\big)$\n- Transition from $H$ to $L$: $k_{HL}(F) = k_{HL}^{0} \\exp\\big(-\\frac{F \\delta_{HL}}{k_{B}T}\\big)$\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that, starting from state $L$, the system's trajectory ends with the transition $H \\to U$. This is a classic \"splitting probability\" or \"committor probability\" problem for an absorbing Markov chain. Let $p_{H|S}$ be the probability that rupture occurs from state $H$, given the process starts in state $S \\in \\{L, H\\}$. The problem asks for $p_H(F) = p_{H|L}$.\n\nWe can set up a system of linear equations for these probabilities using a first-step analysis, which leverages the memoryless property of the exponential holding times in a CTMC. We condition on the first transition out of the current state.\n\nIf the system starts in state $L$, the possible next transitions are to state $H$ (rate $k_{LH}(F)$) or to state $U$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)$). The total rate of leaving state $L$ is $\\lambda_L = k_{LH}(F) + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)$.\n- The probability that the next transition is $L \\to H$ is $\\frac{k_{LH}(F)}{\\lambda_L}$. If this occurs, the process continues from state $H$, and the subsequent probability of rupturing from $H$ is $p_{H|H}$.\n- The probability that the next transition is $L \\to U$ is $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)}{\\lambda_L}$. If this occurs, the bond has ruptured from state $L$. The probability of rupture from state $H$ is $0$.\nCombining these possibilities yields the equation for $p_{H|L}$:\n$$ p_{H|L} = \\frac{k_{LH}(F)}{k_{LH}(F) + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)} \\cdot p_{H|H} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)}{k_{LH}(F) + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)} \\cdot 0 $$\n$$ p_{H|L} = \\frac{k_{LH}(F)}{k_{LH}(F) + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)} p_{H|H} \\quad (1) $$\n\nIf the system starts in state $H$, the possible next transitions are to state $L$ (rate $k_{HL}(F)$) or to state $U$ (rate $k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)$). The total rate of leaving state $H$ is $\\lambda_H = k_{HL}(F) + k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)$.\n- The probability that the next transition is $H \\to L$ is $\\frac{k_{HL}(F)}{\\lambda_H}$. The process then restarts from state $L$, and the subsequent probability of rupturing from $H$ is $p_{H|L}$.\n- The probability that the next transition is $H \\to U$ is $\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)}{\\lambda_H}$. If this occurs, the bond has ruptured from state $H$, which is the event of interest. The probability is $1$.\nThis gives the equation for $p_{H|H}$:\n$$ p_{H|H} = \\frac{k_{HL}(F)}{k_{HL}(F) + k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)} \\cdot p_{H|L} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)}{k_{HL}(F) + k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)} \\cdot 1 \\quad (2) $$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $p_{H|L}$ and $p_{H|H}$. For notational simplicity in the algebraic manipulation, we temporarily drop the explicit dependence on $F$. Substitute equation (1) into (2):\n$$ p_{H|H} = \\frac{k_{HL}}{k_{HL} + k_{\\mathrm{off},H}} \\left( \\frac{k_{LH}}{k_{LH} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}} p_{H|H} \\right) + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}}{k_{HL} + k_{\\mathrm{off},H}} $$\nSolving for $p_{H|H}$:\n$$ p_{H|H} \\left( 1 - \\frac{k_{HL} k_{LH}}{(k_{HL} + k_{\\mathrm{off},H})(k_{LH} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L})} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}}{k_{HL} + k_{\\mathrm{off},H}} $$\n$$ p_{H|H} \\left( \\frac{(k_{HL} + k_{\\mathrm{off},H})(k_{LH} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}) - k_{HL} k_{LH}}{(k_{HL} + k_{\\mathrm{off},H})(k_{LH} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L})} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}}{k_{HL} + k_{\\mathrm{off},H}} $$\n$$ p_{H|H} \\left( \\frac{k_{HL}k_{\\mathrm{off},L} + k_{LH}k_{\\mathrm{off},H} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}k_{\\mathrm{off},H}}{(k_{HL} + k_{\\mathrm{off},H})(k_{LH} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L})} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}}{k_{HL} + k_{\\mathrm{off},H}} $$\n$$ p_{H|H} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(k_{LH} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L})}{k_{HL}k_{\\mathrm{off},L} + k_{LH}k_{\\mathrm{off},H} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}k_{\\mathrm{off},H}} $$\nNow, substitute this result back into equation (1) to find $p_H(F) = p_{H|L}$:\n$$ p_H(F) = \\frac{k_{LH}}{k_{LH} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}} \\cdot \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(k_{LH} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L})}{k_{HL}k_{\\mathrm{off},L} + k_{LH}k_{\\mathrm{off},H} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}k_{\\mathrm{off},H}} $$\n$$ p_H(F) = \\frac{k_{LH}k_{\\mathrm{off},H}}{k_{HL}k_{\\mathrm{off},L} + k_{LH}k_{\\mathrm{off},H} + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}k_{\\mathrm{off},H}} $$\nThis is the desired expression for the probability of rupturing from state $H$.\n\nNext, we must find the force $F_{1/2}$ such that $p_H(F_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$ \\frac{k_{LH}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)}{k_{HL}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F) + k_{LH}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F) + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ 2 k_{LH}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F) = k_{HL}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F) + k_{LH}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F) + k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F) $$\n$$ k_{LH}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F) - k_{HL}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F) - k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F) = 0 $$\nDividing by $k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F) k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)$ (which are always non-zero) yields a simpler condition:\n$$ \\frac{k_{LH}(F)}{k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)} - \\frac{k_{HL}(F)}{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)} - 1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{k_{LH}(F)}{k_{\\mathrm{off},L}(F)} - \\frac{k_{HL}(F)}{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}(F)} = 1 $$\nLet's substitute the force-dependent rate expressions into this equation and let $F = F_{1/2}$:\n$$ \\frac{k_{LH}^{0} \\exp\\big(\\frac{F \\delta_{LH}}{k_{B}T}\\big)}{k_{\\mathrm{off},L}^{0} \\exp\\big(\\frac{F x_{L}}{k_{B}T}\\big)} - \\frac{k_{HL}^{0} \\exp\\big(-\\frac{F \\delta_{HL}}{k_{B}T}\\big)}{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}^{0} \\exp\\big(\\frac{F x_{H}}{k_{B}T}\\big)} = 1 $$\nCombine the exponential terms:\n$$ \\frac{k_{LH}^{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{off},L}^{0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{F (\\delta_{LH} - x_L)}{k_{B}T}\\right) - \\frac{k_{HL}^{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}^{0}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{F (-\\delta_{HL} - x_H)}{k_{B}T}\\right) = 1 $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\frac{k_{LH}^{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{off},L}^{0}} = \\frac{5 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 5$\n- $\\frac{k_{HL}^{0}}{k_{\\mathrm{off},H}^{0}} = \\frac{50 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.01 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 5000$\n- $\\frac{\\delta_{LH} - x_L}{k_B T} = \\frac{0.6 \\ \\mathrm{nm} - 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{nm}}{4.114 \\ \\mathrm{pN \\cdot nm}} = \\frac{0.1}{4.114} \\ (\\mathrm{pN})^{-1} \\approx 0.024307 \\ (\\mathrm{pN})^{-1}$\n- $\\frac{-\\delta_{HL} - x_H}{k_B T} = \\frac{-0.3 \\ \\mathrm{nm} - 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{nm}}{4.114 \\ \\mathrm{pN \\cdot nm}} = \\frac{-0.4}{4.114} \\ (\\mathrm{pN})^{-1} \\approx -0.097229 \\ (\\mathrm{pN})^{-1}$\n\nThe transcendental equation for $F = F_{1/2}$ is:\n$$ 5 \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.1 F}{4.114}\\right) - 5000 \\exp\\left(\\frac{-0.4 F}{4.114}\\right) = 1 $$\nThis equation does not have a simple analytical solution for $F$ and must be solved numerically. Let $g(F) = 5 \\exp(\\frac{0.1 F}{4.114}) - 5000 \\exp(\\frac{-0.4 F}{4.114}) - 1$. We need to find the root of $g(F)=0$. The function $g(F)$ is monotonically increasing for $F > 0$, so a unique positive root exists.\n\nLet $y = \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.1 F}{4.114}\\right)$. Then the equation becomes $5y - 5000y^{-4} - 1 = 0$, or $5y^5 - y^4 - 5000 = 0$. Using a numerical root-finding method (such as Newton's method or bisection), we find the unique positive real root to be $y \\approx 4.02609$.\n\nNow, we solve for $F$:\n$y = \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.1 F}{4.114}\\right) \\implies \\ln(y) = \\frac{0.1 F}{4.114}$\n$$ F = \\frac{4.114}{0.1} \\ln(y) = 41.14 \\ln(4.02609) $$\n$$ F \\approx 41.14 \\times 1.39281 \\approx 57.294 \\ \\mathrm{pN} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ F_{1/2} \\approx 57.3 \\ \\mathrm{pN} $$\nThis force $F_{1/2}$ represents the critical tension at which the dominant rupture pathway switches from the low-affinity state to the high-affinity state. This switch is characteristic of a catch bond mechanism, where the bond lifetime first increases with force before eventually decreasing.",
