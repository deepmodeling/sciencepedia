            "problem": "A perfusion bioreactor is used to deliver steady, one-dimensional flow through a cylindrical tissue-engineering scaffold. The fluid is an incompressible, Newtonian culture medium with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, and the scaffold is macroscopically homogeneous and isotropic. The superficial (Darcy) velocity is defined by $v_{s}=Q/A$, where $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate and $A$ is the cross-sectional area normal to flow.

The governing principles—Stokes flow at the microscale and Darcy's law at the macroscale—are well-established. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective, ensuring a unique solution exists. The language is objective and unambiguous. All provided numerical values for the experimental setup are physically realistic for a lab-scale bioreactor. The problem setup is self-contained and free of contradictions in its physical and mathematical description.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation begins from the principles of fluid mechanics in the low Reynolds number limit. For creeping flow through the pores of the scaffold, the fluid motion is governed by the steady-state Stokes equations for an incompressible, Newtonian fluid:\n$$ \\nabla p_f = \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}$ is the local velocity vector within the fluid phase, $p_f$ is the local pressure, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nTo describe the macroscopic flow, these equations are averaged over a Representative Elementary Volume (REV) that is large compared to the pore scale but small compared to the overall scaffold dimensions. This process, known as homogenization, relates the macroscopic pressure gradient, $\\nabla P$, to the macroscopic superficial velocity, $\\mathbf{v}_s$. The term $\\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$ represents the viscous forces. Its volume average represents the total drag force exerted by the solid matrix on the fluid per unit volume. For a homogeneous and isotropic porous medium, this drag force is linearly proportional to the superficial velocity. The resulting macroscopic momentum balance is:\n$$ \\nabla P = -\\frac{\\mu}{k} \\mathbf{v}_s $$\nRearranging this equation gives the standard form of Darcy's Law:\n$$ \\mathbf{v}_s = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\nabla P $$\nHere, $k$ is the intrinsic permeability of the porous medium, a property that depends only on the geometry of the porous structure.\n\nThe problem specifies a steady, one-dimensional flow through the scaffold of thickness $L$. Let the flow be in the $z$-direction. The vector equation simplifies to the scalar form:\n$$ v_s = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} $$\nFor a homogeneous scaffold, the permeability $k$ is constant. If the flow rate $Q$ is constant, the superficial velocity $v_s = Q/A$ is also constant. This implies that the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ must be constant. We can therefore replace the differential form with a finite difference across the scaffold thickness $L$:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dz} = \\frac{P_{out} - P_{in}}{L} = -\\frac{P_{in} - P_{out}}{L} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L} $$\nwhere $\\Delta p$ is the pressure drop across the scaffold. Substituting this into the one-dimensional Darcy's Law yields:\n$$ v_s = -\\frac{k}{\\mu} \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}\\right) = \\frac{k \\Delta p}{\\mu L} $$\nThe superficial velocity $v_s$ is defined as the volumetric flow rate $Q$ divided by the cross-sectional area $A$. Substituting $v_s = Q/A$:\n$$ \\frac{Q}{A} = \\frac{k \\Delta p}{\\mu L} $$\nSolving for the intrinsic permeability $k$, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$ k = \\frac{Q \\mu L}{A \\Delta p} $$\nThis expression links the intrinsic permeability to the measurable quantities.\n\nNext, we evaluate $k$ using the provided data.

For fully developed laminar flow in a straight channel (let the direction of flow be $x$) between two infinite parallel plates separated by a distance $H$ (the $y$-direction), the Navier-Stokes equation in the $x$-direction simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dp}{dx} + \\mu \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} $$\nwhere $u(y)$ is the velocity profile in the $x$-direction, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.

Let's arrange the coordinate system such that the bottom wall is at $y=0$ and the top wall is at $y=H$.\n\nThe equation can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y + C_1 $$\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined by the no-slip boundary conditions at the walls:\n$1.$ $u(0) = 0$\n$2.$ $u(H) = 0$\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$ u(0) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (0)^2 + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0 $$\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$ u(H) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} H^2 + C_1 H = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{H}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the velocity equation gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 - \\frac{H}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - Hy) $$\nSince the flow is driven by pressure, the pressure must decrease along the flow direction, meaning $\\frac{dp}{dx}  0$.
