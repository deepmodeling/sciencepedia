For any cell in a quasi-static state, Newton's laws dictate that the total force and torque it exerts on its surroundings must be zero.

            "problem": "An adherent cell on a linear elastic, effectively infinite, planar substrate is analyzed by Traction Force Microscopy (TFM). The measured in-plane traction field exerted by the cell on the substrate (per unit area of the substrate) is modeled, in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ on the substrate plane with origin at the cell centroid, as\n$$\n\\mathbf{t}(x,y) = t_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}},\n$$\nwhere $t_{0}>0$ is a constant with units of Pascals and $a>0$ is a characteristic length with units of meters.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem in the domain of biomechanics, specifically concerning cell traction force microscopy (TFM). The task is to validate the problem statement and, if it is valid, to solve it.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   The in-plane traction field exerted by a cell on a substrate is given by the vector function: $\\mathbf{t}(x,y) = t_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{a^{2}}\\right)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n-   The coordinate system is Cartesian $(x,y)$ with the origin at the cell centroid.\n-   The constants $t_{0}$ and $a$ are positive, with $t_{0} > 0$ and $a > 0$.\n-   The substrate is a linear elastic, effectively infinite, planar surface.\n-   The system is under quasi-static conditions (negligible inertia and body forces).\n-   The equilibrium constraints for an isolated cell-substrate system are that the net resultant force and the net resultant moment are zero.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and biomechanics. Traction Force Microscopy is a standard experimental technique. The use of a Gaussian-like function to model the traction field is a common and scientifically reasonable simplification. The equilibrium conditions $(\\sum \\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{0}, \\sum \\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{0})$ are direct consequences of Newton's laws of motion, which are fundamental.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The traction field is a mathematically defined function, and the quantities to be computed (net force and net torque) are determined by well-defined integral operations. The integration domain is implicitly the entire plane $(-\\infty, \\infty) \\times (-\\infty, \\infty)$, consistent with the \"effectively infinite\" substrate. A unique solution exists.\n-   **Objectivity and Completeness**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. All necessary information, including the functional form of the traction field and the parameters, is provided. The task objective is clearly defined.\n-   **Consistency and Feasibility**: The problem is internally consistent. The units are implicitly consistent (Pascals for traction, meters for length, leading to Newtons for force and Newton-meters for torque). The mathematical model is an idealization but is not physically impossible or plausible for the purpose of this analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard mechanics problem applied to a relevant biological context. The necessary calculations are based on fundamental principles and integral calculus. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the net force vector $\\mathbf{F}$ and the net torque $\\tau_z$ about the origin, resulting from the distributed traction field $\\mathbf{t}(x,y)$.\n\n**1. Net Force Calculation**\n\nThe net force $\\mathbf{F}$ is the integral of the traction field $\\mathbf{t}(x,y)$ over the entire area $A$ of the substrate. Since the substrate is \"effectively infinite,\" the domain of integration is the entire $xy$-plane.\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\iint_{A} \\mathbf{t}(x,y) \\,dA = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{t}(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy\n$$\nThe force vector $\\mathbf{F}$ has components $F_x$ and $F_y$. The given traction field is $\\mathbf{t}(x,y) = t_x(x,y)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + t_y(x,y)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, where:\n$$\nt_x(x,y) = t_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{a^2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt_y(x,y) = 0\n$$\nThe $y$-component of the net force, $F_y$, is:\n$$\nF_y = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} t_y(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 0 \\,dx\\,dy = 0\n$$\nThe $x$-component of the net force, $F_x$, is:\n$$\nF_x = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} t_x(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} t_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{a^2}\\right) \\,dx\\,dy\n$$\nWe can separate the exponential term and the integrals:\n$$\nF_x = t_0 \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right) \\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{a^2}\\right) \\,dy \\right)\n$$\nThis involves the standard Gaussian integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-cu^2) \\,du = \\sqrt{\\pi/c}$. In our case, the constant $c = 1/a^2$.\nTherefore, each integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right) \\,dx = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{1/a^2}} = \\sqrt{\\pi a^2} = a\\sqrt{\\pi}\n$$\nThe integral with respect to $y$ is identical. Substituting this result back into the expression for $F_x$:\n$$\nF_x = t_0 (a\\sqrt{\\pi}) (a\\sqrt{\\pi}) = t_0 a^2 \\pi\n$$\nSo, the net force vector is $\\mathbf{F} = (t_0 a^2 \\pi) \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n\n**2. Net Torque Calculation**\n\nThe net out-of-plane torque $\\tau_z$ about the origin is the $z$-component of the moment vector $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\iint_A \\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{t}(x,y) \\,dA$, where $\\mathbf{r} = x\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + y\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ is the position vector.\n$$\n\\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{t} = (x\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + y\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) \\times (t_x \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + t_y \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}) = (x t_y - y t_x)\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\n$$\nThus, $\\tau_z$ is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_z = \\iint_A (x t_y(x,y) - y t_x(x,y)) \\,dA = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (x t_y(x,y) - y t_x(x,y)) \\,dx\\,dy\n$$\nSubstituting $t_x$ and $t_y=0$:\n$$\n\\tau_z = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} -y \\, t_x(x,y) \\,dx\\,dy = -t_0 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{a^2}\\right) \\,dx\\,dy\n$$\nWe can separate the integrals:\n$$\n\\tau_z = -t_0 \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{a^2}\\right) \\,dx \\right) \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{a^2}\\right) \\,dy \\right)\n$$\nThe first integral is $a\\sqrt{\\pi}$, as calculated before. Let's examine the second integral:\n$$\nI_y = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{a^2}\\right) \\,dy\n$$\nThe integrand, $f(y) = y \\exp(-y^2/a^2)$, is an odd function, since $f(-y) = (-y) \\exp(-(-y)^2/a^2) = -y \\exp(-y^2/a^2) = -f(y)$. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$ is zero.\nTherefore, $I_y = 0$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\tau_z$:\n$$\n\\tau_z = -t_0 (a\\sqrt{\\pi}) (0) = 0\n$$\nSo, the net torque is $\\tau_z = 0$.\n\n**3. Equilibrium Constraints Check**\n\nFor an isolated cell-substrate system to be in static equilibrium, both the net force and the net torque must be zero.\n-   Net Force: $\\mathbf{F} = (t_0 a^2 \\pi) \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. Since $t_0 > 0$ and $a > 0$, we have $F_x = t_0 a^2 \\pi \\neq 0$. The net force is not zero.\n-   Net Torque: $\\tau_z = 0$. The net torque is zero.\n\nBecause the net force is non-zero, the equilibrium condition is not satisfied. Physically, this means that for this traction field to exist, an external force of magnitude $-t_0 a^2 \\pi$ in the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ direction must be applied to the cell to hold it in place.\n\nThe indicator $s$ is defined as $1$ if both equilibrium constraints are satisfied and $0$ otherwise. Since the net force is not zero, $s=0$.\n\n**4. Final Result Formulation**\n\nThe required output is a row matrix $(F_{x}, F_{y}, \\tau_{z}, s)$. Based on our calculations:\n-   $F_x = t_0 a^2 \\pi$\n-   $F_y = 0$\n-   $\\tau_z = 0$\n-   $s = 0$\n\nThe final matrix is $(t_0 a^2 \\pi, 0, 0, 0)$.",
