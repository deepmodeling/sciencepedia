            "problem": "A mechanosensitive channel in the two-pore domain potassium channel family, TWIK-related potassium channel $1$ (TREK-$1$), is embedded in a cell membrane under lateral membrane tension. Consider a minimal two-state gating model (closed and open states) in thermal equilibrium. The open and closed state occupancies follow Boltzmann statistics at temperature $T$, and the free energy difference between the open and closed states is additively coupled to the membrane tension $\\gamma$ via the mechanical work term. Specifically, the free energy difference can be expressed as a sum of an intrinsic (zero-tension) term and a mechanical term that is linear in membrane tension and proportional to an effective in-plane area change upon opening. Let the open probability be $P_{o}$.\n\nStarting from these principles and using only fundamental statistical mechanics (Boltzmann weights) and mechanical work under tension, first derive a linear dependence of the natural logarithm of the odds of the open state, $\\ln\\!\\big(P_{o}/(1-P_{o})\\big)$, on the membrane tension $\\gamma$.

            "solution": "The first part of the task is to derive the relationship between the log-odds of the open state and the membrane tension. In a two-state system with a closed state ($C$) and an open state ($O$), the probabilities of occupying each state, $P_C$ and $P_O$, are given by their respective Boltzmann weights:\n$$P_O = \\frac{\\exp(-G_O / (k_B T))}{Z}$$\n$$P_C = \\frac{\\exp(-G_C / (k_B T))}{Z}$$\nwhere $G_O$ and $G_C$ are the free energies of the open and closed states, respectively, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Z = \\exp(-G_O / (k_B T)) + \\exp(-G_C / (k_B T))$ is the partition function.\n\nThe odds of the open state are the ratio of the probability of being open to the probability of being closed, $P_O / P_C$. Since the system must be in one of the two states, $P_O + P_C = 1$, which means $P_C = 1 - P_O$. The odds can therefore be written as $P_O / (1-P_O)$. Using the Boltzmann expressions:\n$$\\frac{P_O}{1-P_O} = \\frac{P_O}{P_C} = \\frac{\\exp(-G_O / (k_B T))}{\\exp(-G_C / (k_B T))} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_O - G_C}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $\\Delta G = G_O - G_C$ is the free energy difference between the open and closed states.\n\nThe problem states that this free energy difference is additively coupled to the membrane tension $\\gamma$. The work done on the channel by the membrane tension when it changes its in-plane area by $\\Delta A = A_O - A_C$ is $W = -\\gamma \\Delta A$. This mechanical work contributes to the free energy difference. Thus, the total free energy difference $\\Delta G$ as a function of tension $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\\Delta G(\\gamma) = \\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_0$ is the intrinsic free energy difference at zero tension ($\\gamma=0$). Substituting this expression back into the equation for the odds gives:\n$$\\frac{P_O}{1-P_O} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nTo find the linear relationship, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_O}{1-P_O}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A}{k_B T} = -\\frac{\\Delta G_0}{k_B T} + \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta A}{k_B T}$$\nThis equation is of the form $y = mx + c$, where $y = \\ln\\!\\big(P_{o}/(1-P_{o})\\big)$, the independent variable is the tension $x = \\gamma$, the y-intercept is $c = -\\Delta G_0/(k_B T)$, and the slope is $m = \\Delta A / (k_B T)$. This completes the derivation, confirming the linear dependence.\n\nThe second part of the task is to calculate the effective area change, $\\Delta A$, using the experimentally measured slope $s_{\\gamma}$.

Within this regime, the open probability of MscS, $P_{\\text{open,S}}$, will increase steeply from a low value to a high value. For example, at $\\gamma = 7.175$ mN/m, $P_{\\text{open,S}} = 0.5$.\n    For MscL, this tension range is far below its activation threshold of $\\gamma_{\\text{mid,L}} = 10.25$ mN/m.

The total tension experienced by the channel is the sum of the applied tension $\\gamma$ and the prestress $\\gamma_{\\text{pre}}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\text{total, before}} = \\gamma + \\gamma_{\\text{pre}}\n$$\nThe free energy difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{before}}(\\gamma) = \\Delta G_0 - A_{\\text{eff, before}}(\\gamma + \\gamma_{\\text{pre}})\n$$\nTo find the apparent half-activation tension, $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}}$, we set $\\Delta G_{\\text{before}} = 0$ at $\\gamma = \\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_0 - A_{\\text{eff, before}}(\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}} + \\gamma_{\\text{pre}}) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{A_{\\text{eff, before}}} - \\gamma_{\\text{pre}}\n$$\n\n**Case 2: After Actin Disruption (Perturbed)**\nAfter the pharmacological treatment, two changes occur:\n1.  The prestress is removed: $\\gamma_{\\text{pre, after}} = 0$. The total tension is simply the applied tension, $\\gamma_{\\text{total, after}} = \\gamma$.\n2.  The effective transmission is scaled by a factor $\\beta$, with $0 < \\beta < 1$. This means the new effective transduction area is reduced:\n    $$\n    A_{\\text{eff, after}} = \\beta \\cdot A_{\\text{eff, before}}\n    $$\nThe free energy difference in the perturbed state is:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\text{after}}(\\gamma) = \\Delta G_0 - A_{\\text{eff, after}}\\gamma = \\Delta G_0 - (\\beta \\cdot A_{\\text{eff, before}})\\gamma\n$$\nTo find the new half-activation tension, $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}}$, we set $\\Delta G_{\\text{after}} = 0$ at $\\gamma = \\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_0 - (\\beta \\cdot A_{\\text{eff, before}})\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}}$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{\\beta \\cdot A_{\\text{eff, before}}}\n$$\n\n**Comparison**\nWe now compare $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}}$ with $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}}$. Let's analyze the change, $\\Delta \\gamma_{1/2} = \\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}} - \\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\gamma_{1/2} = \\left( \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{\\beta \\cdot A_{\\text{eff, before}}} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{A_{\\text{eff, before}}} - \\gamma_{\\text{pre}} \\right)\n$$\nFactor out the common term $\\frac{\\Delta G_0}{A_{\\text{eff, before}}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\gamma_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{A_{\\text{eff, before}}} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta} - 1 \\right) + \\gamma_{\\text{pre}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\gamma_{1/2} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{A_{\\text{eff, before}}} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\beta}{\\beta} \\right) + \\gamma_{\\text{pre}}\n$$\nLet's analyze the sign of this expression.\n-   $\\Delta G_0 > 0$, as the channel is assumed to be predominantly closed at zero tension.\n-   $A_{\\text{eff, before}} > 0$, as tension must do positive work to open the channel.\n-   The problem states $0 < \\beta < 1$, which implies that $\\beta > 0$ and $(1 - \\beta) > 0$. Therefore, the term $\\frac{1-\\beta}{\\beta}$ is positive.\n-   The prestress $\\gamma_{\\text{pre}}$ is a physical tension, so it must be non-negative: $\\gamma_{\\text{pre}} \\ge 0$.\n\nEvery term on the right-hand side is positive (or non-negative in the case of $\\gamma_{pre}$). The first term, related to the loss of coupling efficiency, is strictly positive since $\\beta \\neq 1$. The second term, related to the loss of prestress, is non-negative.\nThus, their sum is strictly positive:\n$$\n\\Delta \\gamma_{1/2} = \\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}} - \\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}} > 0\n$$\nThis proves that $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}} > \\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}}$. The apparent half-activation tension increases after actin disruption. This is intuitively correct: disrupting the force-transmitting machinery (reducing $\\beta$) makes the channel less sensitive, requiring more applied tension to open. Removing the pre-existing cytoskeletal tension ($\\gamma_{\\text{pre}}$), which provided a \"head start\" for activation, also necessitates a larger externally applied tension to reach the activation threshold.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n**A. $\\gamma_{1/2}$ increases after actin disruption.**\nOur derivation shows that $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}} > \\gamma_{1/2, \\text{before}}$. This statement is **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\gamma_{1/2}$ decreases after actin disruption.**\nOur derivation shows that $\\gamma_{1/2}$ increases, directly contradicting this statement. This would require $\\Delta \\gamma_{1/2} < 0$, which is impossible given the problem's constraints. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\gamma_{1/2}$ remains unchanged after actin disruption.**\nThis would require $\\Delta \\gamma_{1/2} = 0$. For this to be true, both terms in our expression for $\\Delta \\gamma_{1/2}$ must be zero (as they are both non-negative). This would require $\\beta = 1$ (no change in coupling) and $\\gamma_{\\text{pre}} = 0$ (no initial prestress). However, the problem explicitly states $0 < \\beta < 1$, indicating a definite disruption. Therefore, this statement is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\gamma_{1/2}$ becomes undefined (no measurable midpoint) under any degree of actin disruption.**\nOur derived expression for $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}}$ is $\\frac{\\Delta G_0}{\\beta \\cdot A_{\\text{eff, before}}}$. As long as $\\beta > 0$ (which it is, since $0 < \\beta < 1$), and assuming $\\Delta G_0$ and $A_{\\text{eff, before}}$ are finite and positive, $\\gamma_{1/2, \\text{after}}$ is a well-defined, finite, and positive value. It only approaches infinity in the limit of complete decoupling ($\\beta \\to 0$). The problem specifies \"any degree of actin disruption\", which includes small disruptions (e.g., $\\beta = 0.9$), for which $\\gamma_{1/2}$ is certainly well-defined and measurable. This statement is **Incorrect**.",
