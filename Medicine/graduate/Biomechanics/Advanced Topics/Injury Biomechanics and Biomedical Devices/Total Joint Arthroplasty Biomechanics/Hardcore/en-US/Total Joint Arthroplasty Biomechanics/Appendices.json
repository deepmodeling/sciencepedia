            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the peak micromotion amplitude at a stem-cement interface in a total hip arthroplasty model. The solution is derived from the principles of static equilibrium, linear elasticity, and Coulomb friction.\n\nFirst, we establish the forces acting at the interface. The applied cyclic bending moment, $M(t) = M_{0}\\sin(2\\pi f t)$, generates a tangential shear force, $F_{\\mathrm{app}}(t)$, at the interface. This force acts at an effective lever arm $r$ from the stem's neutral axis. By the principle of moment equilibrium, we have:\n$$M(t) = F_{\\mathrm{app}}(t) \\cdot r$$\nTherefore, the applied tangential force as a function of time is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{app}}(t) = \\frac{M(t)}{r} = \\frac{M_{0}}{r}\\sin(2\\pi f t)$$\nThe peak amplitude of this applied tangential force, $F_{\\mathrm{peak}}$, occurs when $\\sin(2\\pi f t) = 1$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{M_{0}}{r}$$\n\nThis applied tangential force is resisted by the interface. The problem states two mechanisms for this resistance: a compliant tangential interfacial layer with stiffness $k_{t}$, and Coulomb friction with a maximum available tangential force. The interface will remain in a \"stick\" condition (i.e., no gross slip) as long as the magnitude of the applied tangential force does not exceed the maximum available static friction force, $F_{f,\\mathrm{max}}$. If the applied force is below this threshold, the resulting micromotion is purely the elastic deformation of the compliant layer. If the force exceeds this threshold, gross slip occurs.\n\nThe maximum static friction force is given by the product of the coefficient of friction, $\\mu$, and the constant axial compressive normal load, $N_{0}$:\n$$F_{f,\\mathrm{max}} = \\mu N_{0}$$\n\nWe must first evaluate whether the system is in the stick (fretting) regime or the slip regime by comparing the peak applied tangential force, $F_{\\mathrm{peak}}$, with the maximum static friction force, $F_{f,\\mathrm{max}}$.\n\nUsing the provided parameter values:\n- Bending moment amplitude: $M_{0} = 12\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$\n- Effective lever arm: $r = 7.0\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 7.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Axial load: $N_{0} = 6000\\ \\mathrm{N}$\n- Coefficient of friction: $\\mu = 0.30$\n\nThe peak applied tangential force is:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{12\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}}{7.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}} \\approx 1714.286\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThe maximum available static friction force is:\n$$F_{f,\\mathrm{max}} = (0.30)(6000\\ \\mathrm{N}) = 1800\\ \\mathrm{N}$$\n\nComparing the two forces, we find that $F_{\\mathrm{peak}}  F_{f,\\mathrm{max}}$ ($1714.286\\ \\mathrm{N}  1800\\ \\mathrm{N}$). This critical finding indicates that the interface does not experience gross slip. The system remains in the stick regime for the entire loading cycle.\n\nSince there is no gross slip, the micromotion, $d(t)$, at the interface corresponds to the elastic deformation of the compliant layer, which is modeled as a linear spring of stiffness $k_{t}$. According to Hooke's Law, the restoring force from the spring, $F_{\\mathrm{spring}}(t)$, is proportional to its displacement, $d(t)$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{spring}}(t) = k_{t} d(t)$$\nIn the stick regime, the applied tangential force is balanced by the spring's restoring force:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{app}}(t) = F_{\\mathrm{spring}}(t)$$\n$$ \\frac{M(t)}{r} = k_{t} d(t) $$\nFrom this, we can express the micromotion as a function of time:\n$$d(t) = \\frac{M(t)}{r k_{t}} = \\frac{M_{0}}{r k_{t}}\\sin(2\\pi f t)$$\nThe problem asks for the peak micromotion amplitude, which we denote as $d_{\\mathrm{peak}}$.
