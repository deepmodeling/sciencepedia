            "problem": "A diaphyseal fracture is stabilized by a locking plate construct such that axial load is shared between the plate and the bone via locked screws. Under small deformation and linear elastic behavior, model the axial load path as two linear elastic springs in parallel: one spring representing the plate with axial stiffness $k_{p}$ and the other representing the bone with axial stiffness $k_{b}$. An external axial compressive load of magnitude $F$ is applied to the construct. The interfragmentary motion is defined as the axial relative displacement across the fracture gap, denoted by $\\delta$.\n\nGiven $F = 600$ N, $k_{p} = 20$ kN/mm, and $k_{b} = 10$ kN/mm, use only fundamental definitions from linear elasticity and static equilibrium to derive the governing relation for $\\delta$ in the parallel spring model and compute its numerical value. Express your final numerical answer in millimeters. Do not state or assume any composite stiffness formula a priori; instead, justify it from first principles. You may assume $1$ kN $= 10^{3}$ N. No rounding is required beyond exact arithmetic.",
            "solution": "The solution proceeds by applying fundamental principles of mechanics: static equilibrium, compatibility of displacements, and the linear elastic constitutive law for springs.\n\n1.  **Static Equilibrium**: The external axial compressive load, $F$, applied to the construct is resisted by the internal forces generated within the plate and the bone. Let $F_p$ be the compressive force carried by the plate and $F_b$ be the compressive force carried by the bone. For the system to be in static equilibrium, the sum of these internal forces must balance the external load. This gives the equilibrium equation:\n    $$F = F_p + F_b$$\n\n2.  **Compatibility of Displacements**: The problem models the plate and bone as being in a parallel configuration. A defining characteristic of a parallel system is that all components undergo the same displacement. The problem defines the interfragmentary motion, $\\delta$, as the axial relative displacement across the fracture gap. Since both the plate and the bone span this gap, their axial compressions must be equal to each other and equal to $\\delta$. Let $\\delta_p$ be the displacement of the plate and $\\delta_b$ be the displacement of the bone. The compatibility condition is:\n    $$\\delta = \\delta_p = \\delta_b$$\n\n3.  **Constitutive Law (Linear Elasticity)**: The problem states that the plate and bone behave as linear elastic springs. The relationship between the force in a linear spring and its displacement is given by Hooke's Law. For the plate and bone, this relationship is defined by their respective axial stiffnesses, $k_p$ and $k_b$.\n    The force in the plate is:\n    $$F_p = k_p \\delta_p$$\n    The force in the bone is:\n    $$F_b = k_b \\delta_b$$\n\nNow, we combine these three fundamental relations to derive the governing equation for the interfragmentary motion, $\\delta$.\n\nWe substitute the compatibility condition ($\\delta_p = \\delta_b = \\delta$) into the constitutive equations:\n$$F_p = k_p \\delta$$\n$$F_b = k_b \\delta$$\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions for $F_p$ and $F_b$ into the static equilibrium equation:\n$$F = (k_p \\delta) + (k_b \\delta)$$\n\nThis equation relates the external load $F$ directly to the interfragmentary motion $\\delta$. We can factor out $\\delta$ to make this relationship more explicit:\n$$F = (k_p + k_b)\\delta$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the equivalent stiffness of the parallel construct is the sum of the individual stiffnesses, $k_{eq} = k_p + k_b$. As required, this result was derived from first principles and not assumed.\n\nTo find the interfragmentary motion $\\delta$, we rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{F}{k_p + k_b}$$\nThis is the governing relation for $\\delta$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\delta$ using the given data. First, we must ensure all units are consistent. The load $F$ is in Newtons (N), and the stiffnesses $k_p$ and $k_b$ are in kilonewtons per millimeter (kN/mm). We will convert the stiffnesses to N/mm using the given conversion $1 \\text{ kN} = 10^3 \\text{ N}$.\n\nGiven values:\n$F = 600 \\text{ N}$\n$k_p = 20 \\text{ kN/mm} = 20 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}$\n$k_b = 10 \\text{ kN/mm} = 10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the derived equation for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{600}{20 \\times 10^3 + 10 \\times 10^3}$$\nThe units in the numerator are N and in the denominator are N/mm, so the resulting unit for $\\delta$ will be millimeters (mm), as required.\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{600}{(20 + 10) \\times 10^3} = \\frac{600}{30 \\times 10^3}$$\n$$\\delta = \\frac{600}{30000} = \\frac{6}{300} = \\frac{2}{100}$$\n$$\\delta = 0.02$$\nThe numerical value for the interfragmentary motion is $0.02 \\text{ mm}$.",

This demonstrates that while a longer working length increases flexibility, an excessively long span can be detrimental to fracture healing.",
