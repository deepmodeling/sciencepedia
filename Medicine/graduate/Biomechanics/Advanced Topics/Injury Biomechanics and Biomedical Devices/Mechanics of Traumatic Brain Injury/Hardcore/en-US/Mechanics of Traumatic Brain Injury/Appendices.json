            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) for a translational head impact modeled as a half-sine acceleration pulse. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded within the field of impact biomechanics.\n\nFirst, we must determine the peak acceleration, $a_{\\max}$, from the given impact parameters. The skull's center of mass is brought to rest from an initial velocity $v_{0}$ over a duration $\\Delta t$. According to the impulse-momentum principle, the change in velocity is equal to the time integral of the acceleration. Let the initial velocity be in the positive direction. The acceleration, being a deceleration, must be directed oppositely. However, the form $a(t) = a_{\\max} \\sin(\\pi t / \\Delta t)$ is positive for $t \\in (0, \\Delta t)$. We thus interpret $a(t)$ as the magnitude of the acceleration vector. The change in speed is $v_{0}$.\n\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} a(t) dt = v_{0} $$\nSubstituting the given acceleration profile:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} a_{\\max} \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{\\Delta t}\\right) dt = v_{0} $$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$ a_{\\max} \\left[ -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{\\Delta t}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta t} = v_{0} $$\n$$ a_{\\max} \\left( -\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\pi} \\cos(\\pi) - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\pi} \\cos(0)\\right) \\right) = v_{0} $$\n$$ a_{\\max} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\pi} + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\pi} \\right) = \\frac{2 \\Delta t}{\\pi} a_{\\max} = v_{0} $$\nFrom this, we solve for the peak acceleration $a_{\\max}$:\n$$ a_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi v_{0}}{2 \\Delta t} $$\n\nThe HIC is defined using the acceleration in gravitational units, $a_{g}(t) = a(t)/g_{0}$, where $g_{0} = 9.80665 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^{2}}$.

From the definition of $\\theta_r(t)$, we have $\\ddot{\\theta}_b(t) = \\ddot{\\theta}_r(t) + \\ddot{\\theta}_s(t)$. Substituting this into the equation of motion yields:\n$$ -k\\theta_r - c\\dot{\\theta}_r = I_b(\\ddot{\\theta}_r + \\ddot{\\theta}_s) $$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the governing differential equation for the relative rotation $\\theta_r(t)$:\n$$ I_b \\ddot{\\theta}_r + c\\dot{\\theta}_r + k\\theta_r = -I_b \\alpha_s(t) $$\nThis is the equation of motion for a single-degree-of-freedom system subjected to base excitation.\n\nThe problem states that the pulse duration $T$ is short and that an impulse-momentum approximation should be used.

The initial conditions for this phase, at $\\tau=0$, are $\\theta_r(0) \\approx 0$ and $\\dot{\\theta}_r(0) = -\\frac{2\\alpha_0 T}{\\pi}$.\nThe solution for an underdamped system with zero initial displacement and an initial velocity $\\dot{\\theta}_{r,0}$ is:\n$$ \\theta_r(\\tau) = \\frac{\\dot{\\theta}_{r,0}}{\\omega_d} \\exp(-\\zeta\\omega_n\\tau) \\sin(\\omega_d\\tau) $$\nwhere $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/I_b}$ is the natural frequency, $\\zeta = c/(2\\sqrt{kI_b})$ is the damping ratio, and $\\omega_d = \\omega_n\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}$ is the damped natural frequency.\n\nThe peak relative rotation $|\\theta_r|_{\\max}$ occurs at the first extremum. The time of the first peak, $\\tau_{peak}$, is found by setting $\\frac{d\\theta_r}{d\\tau}=0$, which yields $\\tan(\\omega_d\\tau_{peak}) = \\frac{\\omega_d}{\\zeta\\omega_n}$. The magnitude of the peak is given by the standard formula:\n$$ |\\theta_r|_{\\max} = \\frac{|\\dot{\\theta}_{r,0}|}{\\omega_n} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}\\arccos(\\zeta)\\right) $$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values.\nBrain moment of inertia:\n$$ I_b = \\frac{2}{5}mR^2 = \\frac{2}{5}(1.40\\,\\mathrm{kg})(0.080\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 0.003584\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^2} $$\nSystem parameters:\n$$ \\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{I_b}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{80.64\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m/rad}}{0.003584\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^2}}} = \\sqrt{22500\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} $$\n$$ c_{crit} = 2\\sqrt{kI_b} = 2\\sqrt{(80.64)(0.003584)} \\approx 1.0752\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m\\cdot s/rad} $$\n$$ \\zeta = \\frac{c}{c_{crit}} = \\frac{0.215\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m\\cdot s/rad}}{1.0752\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m\\cdot s/rad}} \\approx 0.19996 $$\nInitial velocity magnitude from the impulse:\n$$ |\\dot{\\theta}_{r,0}| = \\left|-\\frac{2\\alpha_0 T}{\\pi}\\right| = \\frac{2(6000\\,\\mathrm{rad/s^2})(0.010\\,\\mathrm{s})}{\\pi} = \\frac{120}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} $$\nNow we compute the peak relative rotation:\n$$ |\\theta_r|_{\\max} = \\frac{120/\\pi}{150} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.19996}{\\sqrt{1-(0.19996)^2}}\\arccos(0.19996)\\right) $$\n$$ |\\theta_r|_{\\max} = \\frac{0.8}{\\pi} \\exp(-0.20408 \\times 1.36948) \\approx \\frac{0.8}{\\pi} \\exp(-0.27950) $$\n$$ |\\theta_r|_{\\max} \\approx 0.25465 \\times 0.75620 \\approx 0.19257\\,\\mathrm{rad} $$\nNext, we map this peak rotation to the Maximum Principal Strain (MPS) using the provided relations.\nPeak tangential displacement at the brain's surface:\n$$ u_{\\max} = R\\,|\\theta_{r}|_{\\max} = (0.080\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.19257\\,\\mathrm{rad}) \\approx 0.015406\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nPeak shear strain in the coupling layer:\n$$ \\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{u_{\\max}}{L_c} = \\frac{0.015406\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.040\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.38515 $$\nFinally, the Maximum Principal Strain for simple shear is half the shear strain:\n$$ \\mathrm{MPS} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\max}}{2} = \\frac{0.38515}{2} \\approx 0.19258 $$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, we get $0.193$.",
