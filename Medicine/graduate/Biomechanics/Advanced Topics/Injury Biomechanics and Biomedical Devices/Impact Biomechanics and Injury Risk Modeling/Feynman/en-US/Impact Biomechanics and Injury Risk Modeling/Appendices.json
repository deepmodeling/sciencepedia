            "introduction": "Effective protective equipment, like helmets, is designed to manage impact energy and reduce forces transmitted to the body. This is often achieved by incorporating compliant materials that deform significantly, thereby increasing the duration of the impact and absorbing strain energy. This first exercise provides a foundational understanding of this principle by modeling a simplified helmet-skull system as two elastic layers in series. By analyzing how strain energy is partitioned between the stiff skull and the compliant padding , you will gain insight into the critical distinction between intrinsic material compliance and extrinsic structural compliance, a core concept in the design of protective gear.",

            "problem": "A helmeted human head normal impact is modeled as two homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic layers loaded in series: a cranial bone layer (skull) and a compliant padding layer (helmet liner), both sharing the same circular contact patch. The contact patch has area $A = 0.006\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$. The skull layer has thickness $t_{s} = 0.007\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and elastic modulus $E_{s} = 15 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. The padding layer has thickness $t_{p} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and elastic modulus $E_{p} = 40 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. A time-varying normal contact force $F(t)$ acts through the contact patch, with peak magnitude $F_{\\max} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{N}$. Assume that at the instant of peak load the response is quasi-static, both layers remain in their linear elastic regime, and the load is uniformly distributed over the contact area.\n\nStarting only from the definitions of stress $\\sigma$, strain $\\epsilon$, Hooke’s law $\\sigma = E\\,\\epsilon$, the geometric relation between strain and displacement for each layer, and equilibrium of series-connected elastic elements (the same axial force transmits through each layer), derive the expressions that distinguish local material compliance from global structural compliance for this two-layer system. Then, using those expressions, derive the energy-based partition of the total elastic strain energy between the skull and padding at the instant when $F(t) = F_{\\max}$, and compute the fraction of the total elastic strain energy stored in the skull.\n\nReport the skull energy fraction as a single decimal number, rounded to $4$ significant figures. The fraction is dimensionless; do not include any units in your final reported value.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid, being scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model in biomechanics that is solvable using fundamental principles of solid mechanics. All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions are clearly stated and physically reasonable for the scope of the problem.\n\nThe solution is developed by first establishing the governing physical and mathematical principles as requested. The model consists of two elastic layers, the skull ($s$) and padding ($p$), connected in series. This means they share the same contact area $A$ and are subjected to the same normal force $F(t)$. At the moment of peak quasi-static load, this force is $F = F_{\\max}$.\n\nThe definition of uniaxial stress, $\\sigma$, is the force per unit area. Since the force $F_{\\max}$ and area $A$ are common to both layers, the stress in each layer is identical:\n$$\n\\sigma_s = \\sigma_p = \\sigma = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\n$$\n\nThe definition of uniaxial strain, $\\epsilon$, is the change in length per unit original length. For each layer with thickness $t$, the compression (displacement) $\\delta$ is related to strain by $\\epsilon = \\delta/t$.\n\nHooke's law for a linear elastic material relates stress and strain via the elastic modulus, $E$:\n$$\n\\sigma = E \\epsilon\n$$\nApplying this to each layer, we find the strain in the skull and padding:\n$$\n\\epsilon_s = \\frac{\\sigma}{E_s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\epsilon_p = \\frac{\\sigma}{E_p}\n$$\n\nThe compression of each layer, $\\delta_s$ and $\\delta_p$, can be expressed in terms of the applied force:\n$$\n\\delta_s = \\epsilon_s t_s = \\frac{\\sigma}{E_s} t_s = \\left(\\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\\right) \\frac{t_s}{E_s}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_p = \\epsilon_p t_p = \\frac{\\sigma}{E_p} t_p = \\left(\\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\\right) \\frac{t_p}{E_p}\n$$\n\nThe structural stiffness, $k$, of an element is defined by the relation $F = k\\delta$. For each layer, the stiffness is:\n$$\nk_s = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{\\delta_s} = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{\\left(\\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\\right) \\frac{t_s}{E_s}} = \\frac{A E_s}{t_s}\n$$\n$$\nk_p = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{\\delta_p} = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{\\left(\\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\\right) \\frac{t_p}{E_p}} = \\frac{A E_p}{t_p}\n$$\n\nThese expressions allow us to distinguish between local material compliance and global structural compliance.\n- **Local material compliance** is an intrinsic material property, defined as the inverse of the elastic modulus, $1/E$. It quantifies a material's inherent deformability under stress, independent of its size or shape. A material with a high value of $1/E$ (or low $E$) is highly compliant.\n- **Global structural compliance**, $C_{struct}$, is an extrinsic property of a component, defined as the inverse of its stiffness, $C_{struct} = 1/k$. For our layers, this is $C_{struct} = t/(AE)$. This expression explicitly shows that the overall deformability of the structure depends not only on the material's property ($E$) but also on its geometry (thickness $t$ and area $A$).\n\nThe elastic strain energy, $U$, stored in a linearly elastic body can be expressed in several equivalent forms. A convenient form for this problem is $U = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{F^2}{k}$. Applying this to the skull and padding layers at the instant of peak force $F_{\\max}$:\n$$\nU_s = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{F_{\\max}^2}{k_s} = \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_s}{A E_s}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nU_p = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{F_{\\max}^2}{k_p} = \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_p}{A E_p}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe total elastic strain energy stored in the two-layer system is the sum of the energies in each layer:\n$$\nU_{total} = U_s + U_p\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of the total energy stored in the skull. This is the ratio $\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}} = \\frac{U_s}{U_s + U_p} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_s}{A E_s}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_s}{A E_s}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_p}{A E_p}\\right)}\n$$\nThe common factor of $\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{F_{\\max}^2}{A}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the desired energy partition expression:\n$$\n\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{t_s}{E_s}}{\\frac{t_s}{E_s} + \\frac{t_p}{E_p}}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the partitioning of strain energy in a series-loaded system is independent of the applied force and the contact area, and is determined solely by the ratio of the structural compliances per unit area, $t/E$, for each layer.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to compute the fraction:\n- Skull thickness, $t_s = 0.007\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Skull elastic modulus, $E_s = 15 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- Padding thickness, $t_p = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Padding elastic modulus, $E_p = 40 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the compliance-thickness terms for each layer:\n$$\n\\frac{t_s}{E_s} = \\frac{0.007}{15 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{7 \\times 10^{-3}}{15 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{7}{15} \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m/Pa} \\approx 4.6667 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m/Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{t_p}{E_p} = \\frac{0.020}{40 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{4 \\times 10^{7}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m/Pa} = 500 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m/Pa}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these into the fraction expression:\n$$\n\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{15} \\times 10^{-12}}{\\frac{7}{15} \\times 10^{-12} + 500 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{15}}{\\frac{7}{15} + 500}\n$$\nTo combine the terms in the denominator: $500 = \\frac{7500}{15}$.\n$$\n\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{15}}{\\frac{7}{15} + \\frac{7500}{15}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{15}}{\\frac{7507}{15}} = \\frac{7}{7507}\n$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$\n\\frac{7}{7507} \\approx 0.0009324629...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the fraction of the total elastic strain energy stored in the skull is $0.0009325$.",

For such a window, the acceleration is constant, so the time average equals the constant value:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} a(t)\\, dt = \\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} a_0\\, dt = \\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}\\, a_0 (t_2 - t_1) = a_0.\n$$\nThus, for windows fully inside the rectangular pulse,\n$$\nH(t_1,t_2) = (t_2 - t_1)\\left[a_0\\right]^{2.5} = a_0^{2.5}(t_2 - t_1).\n$$\nThis expression is linear in the window duration $(t_2 - t_1)$, which implies that within the pulse, $H(t_1,t_2)$ is monotonically increasing with the window length. Therefore, the maximum value over windows entirely inside the pulse is achieved by choosing the longest such window. Because $\\Delta t \\leq T^*$ by assumption, the longest window fully inside the pulse is the entire pulse itself, with $t_1=0$ and $t_2=\\Delta t$. Hence,\n$$\nH_{\\text{inside,max}} = a_0^{2.5}\\Delta t.\n$$\n\nNext, consider windows that extend beyond the pulse and include times where $a(t)=0$.
