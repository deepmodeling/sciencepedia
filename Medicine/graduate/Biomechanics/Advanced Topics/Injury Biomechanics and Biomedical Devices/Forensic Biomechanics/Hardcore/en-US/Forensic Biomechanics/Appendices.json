            "problem": "A forensic biomechanics team is reconstructing a blunt-force event in which a rigid baton strikes a subject’s forearm protected by an instrumented brace. The brace reports the external contact force applied to the forearm-hand segment along a fixed laboratory axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. Over the impact interval $0 \\leq t \\leq T$, the measured contact force magnitude $F(t)$ rises linearly to a peak and then decays linearly, with constant direction in the plane at an obliquity angle $\\theta$ relative to $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. The forearm-hand segment has known mass $m$, and other external influences (gravity and joint reactions) are negligible on the short impact timescale compared to the measured contact force. Specifically, the force-time history is\n$$\nF(t)=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{2 F_{\\text{peak}}}{T}\\,t,  0 \\leq t \\leq \\dfrac{T}{2} \\\\\n2 F_{\\text{peak}}\\left(1-\\dfrac{t}{T}\\right),  \\dfrac{T}{2} \\leq t \\leq T\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwith direction fixed by the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}=\\cos(\\theta)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}+\\sin(\\theta)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.

This is a fundamental principle of classical mechanics. The use of a triangular force pulse is a standard and physically reasonable model for simple impacts. The problem is set within the field of forensic biomechanics and is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a complete mathematical description of the force vector as a function of time and asks for a specific, calculable quantity (the time integral of one component of this force). All necessary parameters ($F_{\\text{peak}}$, $T$, $\\theta$) are given. The existence of the forearm mass $m$ is noted, but it is not required to calculate the change in momentum, only the resulting change in velocity. This does not represent a contradiction, but rather a piece of information not pertinent to the specific question asked. A unique, stable solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms. There is no subjective, ambiguous, or opinion-based language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard application of the impulse-momentum principle from classical mechanics. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe analysis proceeds from the impulse-momentum theorem, which is a first principle of mechanics appropriate for impact analysis. The theorem states that the change in linear momentum, $\\Delta\\mathbf{p}$, of a body is equal to the net impulse, $\\mathbf{I}$, exerted on it. The impulse is defined as the time integral of the net force vector, $\\mathbf{F}(t)$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{I} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\mathbf{F}(t) \\, dt\n$$\nIn this problem, the impact occurs over the time interval $[0, T]$. The force vector $\\mathbf{F}(t)$ is given by its magnitude $F(t)$ and its constant direction unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}(t) = F(t)\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = F(t) \\left( \\cos(\\theta)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\sin(\\theta)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the change in the linear momentum component along the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ direction, which we denote as $\\Delta p_x$. This is the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$-component of the total impulse vector $\\mathbf{I}$.\n$$\n\\Delta p_x = \\mathbf{I} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbf{F}(t) \\, dt \\right) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nWe can bring the dot product inside the integral:\n$$\n\\Delta p_x = \\int_{0}^{T} (\\mathbf{F}(t) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) \\, dt\n$$\nThe $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$-component of the force vector is $F_x(t) = \\mathbf{F}(t) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbf{F}(t)$:\n$$\nF_x(t) = F(t) \\left( \\cos(\\theta)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\sin(\\theta)\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} \\right) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = F(t) \\cos(\\theta)\n$$\nSince the angle $\\theta$ is constant, $\\cos(\\theta)$ is a constant factor. We can therefore write the expression for $\\Delta p_x$ as:\n$$\n\\Delta p_x = \\int_{0}^{T} F(t) \\cos(\\theta) \\, dt = \\cos(\\theta) \\int_{0}^{T} F(t) \\, dt\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{T} F(t) \\, dt$ represents the total magnitude of the impulse. This integral can be evaluated by direct integration of the given piecewise function for $F(t)$, or more simply, by calculating the area under the force-time curve. The function $F(t)$ describes a triangle with base $T$ and height $F_{\\text{peak}}$.\n\nThe area of a triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\nThus, the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} F(t) \\, dt = \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} T F_{\\text{peak}}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\Delta p_x$:\n$$\n\\Delta p_x = \\frac{1}{2} T F_{\\text{peak}} \\cos(\\theta)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this symbolic expression. The mass $m=1.60 \\, \\text{kg}$ is not needed for this calculation.\n-   $F_{\\text{peak}} = 2.80 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\text{N}$\n-   $T = 1.60 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{s}$\n-   $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$\n\nFirst, we evaluate $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\cos(30^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n$$\nNow, we compute $\\Delta p_x$:\n$$\n\\Delta p_x = \\frac{1}{2} (1.60 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\text{s}) (2.80 \\times 10^{3} \\, \\text{N}) \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_x = \\frac{1}{4} (1.60 \\times 2.80) \\times 10^{(-2+3)} \\sqrt{3} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_x = \\frac{1}{4} (4.48) \\times 10^{1} \\sqrt{3} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_x = 1.12 \\times 10^{1} \\sqrt{3} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_x = 11.2 \\sqrt{3} \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires a numerical answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta p_x \\approx 11.2 \\times 1.7320508... \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_x \\approx 19.398969... \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $19.40$. The trailing zero is significant.\nThe final result for the change in the forearm's linear momentum component along $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ is $19.40 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{s}$.",
