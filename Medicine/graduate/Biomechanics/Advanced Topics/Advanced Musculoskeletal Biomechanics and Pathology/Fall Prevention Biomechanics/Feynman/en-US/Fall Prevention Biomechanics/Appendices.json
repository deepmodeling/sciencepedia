            "introduction": "Maintaining balance begins with understanding the fundamental principles of static stability. Before we can analyze dynamic falls, we must first grasp the static limits within which balance can be maintained without taking a step. This exercise  invites you to model the human body as a simple inverted pendulum to determine the maximum lean angle possible before the center of mass projection leaves the base of support. By deriving this limit, you will develop a foundational, quantitative intuition for the geometric relationship between the body's posture and its stability.",

            "problem": "A human subject stands quietly with both feet flat on level ground. Model the whole body above the ankles as a single rigid segment that can rotate in the sagittal plane about the ankle joints without foot lift-off. The foot is modeled as a rigid support of length $L$ from heel to toe, with the ankle joint center located a distance $a$ anterior to the heel ($0<a<L$). The Center of Mass (COM) of the whole body relative to the ankle joint, in the initial upright posture ($\\theta=0$), has horizontal offset $x_0$ (positive anterior) and vertical height $h$ (positive upward), with $h>0$ and $-a \\le x_0 \\le L-a$. Assume high friction with the ground so that slip does not occur and the Base of Support (BoS) is the line segment from heel to toe.\n\nThe subject leans forward by an angle $\\theta$ (positive for anterior lean) through rigid rotation about the ankle joint, while maintaining static equilibrium (no linear or angular acceleration). Using Newton’s laws and moment balance for rigid bodies in static equilibrium, derive how the vertical line of action of the gravitational force through the COM projects onto the ground relative to the ankle as a function of $\\theta$. Then, using the requirement for static stability that the resultant ground reaction line of action must lie within the BoS, compute the maximum allowable forward-lean angle $\\theta_{\\max}$ at which static stability is just maintained before loss of stability at the toe. Express your final answer for $\\theta_{\\max}$ in radians. No numerical evaluation is required; provide a closed-form analytic expression.",
            "solution": "We begin by establishing a coordinate system. Let the origin $(0,0)$ be the center of the ankle joint. Let the $x$-axis be horizontal and point anteriorly (forward), and the $y$-axis be vertical and point upward.\n\nIn the initial upright posture ($\\theta=0$), the Center of Mass (COM) of the body is located at the coordinates $(x_0, h)$. The position vector of the COM is $\\vec{r}_{0} = x_0\\hat{i} + h\\hat{j}$.\n\nThe subject leans forward by an angle $\\theta$. This corresponds to a rigid body rotation about the origin (the ankle joint). Since a forward lean ($\\theta > 0$) is an anterior rotation, in our coordinate system this is a clockwise rotation. The rotation transformation for a point $(x,y)$ rotated clockwise by an angle $\\theta$ is $(x\\cos\\theta + y\\sin\\theta, -x\\sin\\theta + y\\cos\\theta)$.\n\nApplying this transformation to the initial COM coordinates $(x_0, h)$, we find the new coordinates of the COM, $(x_{\\text{COM}}, y_{\\text{COM}})$, as a function of $\\theta$:\n$$x_{\\text{COM}}(\\theta) = x_0 \\cos\\theta + h \\sin\\theta$$\n$$y_{\\text{COM}}(\\theta) = -x_0 \\sin\\theta + h \\cos\\theta$$\n\nFor the body to be in static equilibrium, the net force and net moment on the total system (body and feet) must be zero. The external forces are the gravitational force, $\\vec{F}_g = -mg\\hat{j}$, acting through the COM, and the ground reaction force (GRF). For equilibrium, the GRF must be equal and opposite to the gravitational force, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}} = mg\\hat{j}$. For the net moment to be zero, the line of action of the GRF must be collinear with the line of action of the gravitational force.\nThe line of action of gravity is the vertical line passing through the current COM, which is $x = x_{\\text{COM}}(\\theta)$. Therefore, the resultant GRF acts at a point on the ground called the Center of Pressure (CoP), whose horizontal position, $x_{\\text{CoP}}$, must coincide with the horizontal position of the COM.\n\nThe projection of the vertical line of action of the gravitational force onto the ground, relative to the ankle, is thus given by the horizontal coordinate of the COM:\n$$x_{\\text{proj}}(\\theta) = x_{\\text{COM}}(\\theta) = x_0 \\cos\\theta + h \\sin\\theta$$\n\nNext, we use the condition for static stability. Stability is maintained as long as the CoP lies within the Base of Support (BoS). The BoS is the region of contact between the feet and the ground. In this model, it is the line segment from the heel to the toe. With the ankle at $x=0$, the heel is at $x=-a$ and the toe is at $x=L-a$. Thus, the BoS is the interval $[-a, L-a]$.\n\nThe stability condition is:\n$$-a \\le x_{\\text{CoP}}(\\theta) \\le L-a$$\nThe maximum allowable forward-lean angle, $\\theta_{\\max}$, is reached when the CoP is at the most anterior point of the BoS, which is the toe. At this verge of instability:\n$$x_{\\text{CoP}}(\\theta_{\\max}) = L-a$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $x_{\\text{CoP}}$:\n$$x_0 \\cos\\theta_{\\max} + h \\sin\\theta_{\\max} = L-a$$\n\nThis is a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be solved using the R-formula. Let's express the left side in the form $R\\sin(\\theta + \\beta)$.\nLet $R = \\sqrt{x_0^2 + h^2}$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n$$R \\left( \\frac{h}{R} \\sin\\theta_{\\max} + \\frac{x_0}{R} \\cos\\theta_{\\max} \\right) = L-a$$\nLet's define an auxiliary angle $\\beta$ such that $\\cos\\beta = \\frac{h}{R}$ and $\\sin\\beta = \\frac{x_0}{R}$. This definition is valid as $(\\frac{h}{R})^2 + (\\frac{x_0}{R})^2 = \\frac{h^2+x_0^2}{R^2} = 1$. The angle $\\beta$ is given by $\\tan\\beta = \\frac{\\sin\\beta}{\\cos\\beta} = \\frac{x_0/R}{h/R} = \\frac{x_0}{h}$. Thus, $\\beta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x_0}{h}\\right)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we use the sine addition identity, $\\sin(A+B) = \\sin A \\cos B + \\cos A \\sin B$:\n$$R (\\sin\\theta_{\\max}\\cos\\beta + \\cos\\theta_{\\max}\\sin\\beta) = L-a$$\n$$R \\sin(\\theta_{\\max} + \\beta) = L-a$$\nNow, we solve for $\\theta_{\\max}$:\n$$\\sin(\\theta_{\\max} + \\beta) = \\frac{L-a}{R} = \\frac{L-a}{\\sqrt{x_0^2 + h^2}}$$\n$$\\theta_{\\max} + \\beta = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{L-a}{\\sqrt{x_0^2 + h^2}}\\right)$$\n$$\\theta_{\\max} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{L-a}{\\sqrt{x_0^2 + h^2}}\\right) - \\beta$$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $\\beta$:\n$$\\theta_{\\max} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{L-a}{\\sqrt{x_0^2 + h^2}}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x_0}{h}\\right)$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the maximum forward-lean angle in radians.",

To analyze these scenarios, we move from static models to the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), a cornerstone of dynamic balance research.

Mastering this concept is crucial for understanding how the central nervous system can manage dynamic instability and prevent a fall.",

            "problem": "A human subject is modeled as a point-mass Center of Mass (COM) attached to a massless leg with an ankle pivot at a fixed ground support point, forming the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM). The COM moves in the horizontal forward-backward direction with coordinate $x(t)$ relative to the current stance ankle at $x=0$, and the COM height is held approximately constant at $z_0$. The subject experiences a backward push at time $t=0$ that instantaneously imparts a backward COM velocity $\\dot{x}(0)<0$ while leaving the stance location unchanged. The gravitational acceleration is $g$ and the stance foot is initially at $u=0$.\n\nStarting directly from Newton’s second law and the geometric constraint of the LIPM, derive the expression for the posterior capture point defined as the unique backward foot placement location $u_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ such that, if the foot is instantaneously placed there at $t=0$, the COM can come to rest above the new base of support without requiring additional steps.

Round both $u_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ and $\\ell$ to four significant figures, and express both answers in meters. Angles are not involved in this problem.",
            "solution": "### Derivation of the Capture Point Expression\nLet the mass of the subject be $m$. The COM is at position $\\vec{r}(t) = x(t)\\hat{i} + z_0\\hat{j}$, where $\\hat{i}$ and $\\hat{j}$ are the horizontal and vertical unit vectors, respectively. The ankle pivot is at position $\\vec{u} = u\\hat{i}$.\n\nThe forces acting on the COM are gravity, $\\vec{F}_g = -mg\\hat{j}$, and the leg constraint force, $\\vec{F}_{leg}$, which acts along the line connecting the ankle pivot to the COM. Let the vector from the pivot to the COM be $\\vec{L} = (x-u)\\hat{i} + z_0\\hat{j}$. The leg force can be written as $\\vec{F}_{leg} = T \\frac{\\vec{L}}{|\\vec{L}|}$, where $T$ is the magnitude of the force.\n\nNewton's second law states $m\\vec{a} = \\sum \\vec{F}$. The acceleration is $\\vec{a} = \\frac{d^2\\vec{r}}{dt^2} = \\ddot{x}(t)\\hat{i}$ since $z_0$ is constant.\nThe equations of motion in component form are:\nHorizontal (x-direction): $m\\ddot{x} = F_{leg,x} = T \\frac{x-u}{|\\vec{L}|}$\nVertical (y-direction): $m\\ddot{y} = 0 = F_{leg,y} - mg = T \\frac{z_0}{|\\vec{L}|} - mg$\n\nFrom the vertical equation, we solve for the magnitude of the leg force, $T$:\n$T \\frac{z_0}{|\\vec{L}|} = mg \\implies T = \\frac{mg|\\vec{L}|}{z_0}$\n\nSubstitute this expression for $T$ into the horizontal equation of motion:\n$m\\ddot{x} = \\left(\\frac{mg|\\vec{L}|}{z_0}\\right) \\frac{x-u}{|\\vec{L}|} = \\frac{mg}{z_0}(x-u)$\n\nDividing by $m$, we obtain the governing differential equation for the LIPM:\n$\\ddot{x}(t) - \\frac{g}{z_0}(x(t)-u) = 0$\n\nThis equation describes the COM motion relative to a fixed pivot at location $u$. The problem states that at $t=0$, the foot is instantaneously moved to the capture point location $u=u_{\\mathrm{cap}}$. The initial state of the COM for this new phase of motion is $(x(0), \\dot{x}(0))$. The capture condition requires that the COM comes to rest above the new pivot, meaning $x(t) \\to u_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ and $\\dot{x}(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nTo solve this, we define a new variable representing the COM position relative to the new pivot:\n$x_{rel}(t) = x(t) - u_{\\mathrm{cap}}$\nSince $u_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ is constant, $\\ddot{x}_{rel}(t) = \\ddot{x}(t)$. The differential equation becomes:\n$\\ddot{x}_{rel}(t) - \\frac{g}{z_0}x_{rel}(t) = 0$\n\nLet's define the characteristic frequency $\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{z_0}}$.

In the general solution, the term $A e^{\\omega t}$ represents an unstable mode that grows exponentially with time (since $\\omega > 0$).

            "solution": "### Derivation of the Solution\n\n**1. Equation of Motion for the Linear Inverted Pendulum**\n\nWe model the human body as a point mass $m$ at a constant height $h$ above the ground. The pivot point is the ankle, which corresponds to the anterior boundary of the base of support at $x=0$. Newton's second law for the horizontal motion of the center of mass is $m\\ddot{x} = F_x$, where $F_x$ is the horizontal component of the ground reaction force.\n\nFor the LIPM, the ground reaction force vector is assumed to point from the pivot to the CoM. The vertical component of the ground reaction force must balance gravity, as the vertical acceleration is zero (constant height $h$), so $F_y = mg$. The relationship between the force components is given by the geometry of the pendulum:\n$$\n\\frac{F_x}{F_y} = \\frac{x}{h}\n$$\nSubstituting $F_y = mg$, we find the horizontal force:\n$$\nF_x = mg\\frac{x}{h}\n$$\nSubstituting this into Newton's second law:\n$$\nm\\ddot{x} = mg\\frac{x}{h} \\implies \\ddot{x} - \\frac{g}{h}x = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.
