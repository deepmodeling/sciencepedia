            "problem": "Consider stair ascent where a rigid force plate is embedded flush with the tread surface of a single stair. Let the Global Laboratory Frame (GLF) be denoted by orthonormal basis vectors $\\hat{\\mathbf{X}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$, with $\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$ vertical and pointing upward. Let the Force Plate coordinate Frame (FPF) be denoted by $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, with $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ the surface normal of the tread, $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ along the stair run (anterior-posterior), and $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ lateral. The FPF is mounted at a pitch angle $\\alpha$ relative to the GLF by a right-handed rotation about $\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}$, and at a yaw angle $\\psi$ by a right-handed rotation about $\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$. Angles $\\alpha$ and $\\psi$ are given in radians.\n\nThe force plate outputs a force vector $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$ and a free moment vector $\\mathbf{M}_{L}$, both expressed in the FPF and referenced to the plate’s origin. Using Newton’s laws and rigid body kinematics (including the definition of an orthonormal basis and the direction cosine relationships), perform the following:\n\n1. Derive the $3 \\times 3$ rotation matrix $C(\\alpha,\\psi)$ that maps any vector expressed in the FPF to the GLF, i.e., $\\mathbf{v}_{G} = C(\\alpha,\\psi)\\,\\mathbf{v}_{L}$. Your derivation must make explicit the composition of the yaw about $\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$ and the pitch about $\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}$ as applied to the FPF relative to the GLF.\n\n2.

Report the recovered global vertical force component as a single scalar. Round your answer to four significant figures. Express the final force in newtons (N).

The application is in biomechanics, a legitimate scientific discipline. The principles invoked are fundamental and well-established. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem's tasks are clearly defined.\n    1.  The derivation of the rotation matrix is based on a specified sequence of rotations (\"composition of the yaw... and the pitch\"). The use of GLF axes ($\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$) for the rotations specifies an extrinsic rotation sequence, which is unambiguous.\n    2.  The transformation of forces and moments is a standard application of the derived rotation matrix. The simplifying condition of coincident origins is explicitly stated.\n    3.  The validation calculation is a concrete and solvable exercise with all necessary data provided ($m$, $g$, and the target precision). The fact that the angles $\\alpha$ and $\\psi$ are symbolic is a feature, not a flaw, designed to test the algebraic consistency of the transformations.\n-   **No other flaws detected**: The problem is complete, consistent, realistic for a lab setting, and not trivial, as it requires correct derivation and application of matrix algebra.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n#### 1. Derivation of the Rotation Matrix $C(\\alpha,\\psi)$\n\nThe rotation matrix $C(\\alpha,\\psi)$ transforms the coordinates of a vector from the Force Plate Frame (FPF, or local frame $L$) to the Global Laboratory Frame (GLF, or global frame $G$), i.e., $\\mathbf{v}_{G} = C(\\alpha,\\psi)\\,\\mathbf{v}_{L}$.\n\nThe orientation of the FPF is obtained by a sequence of rotations applied to the GLF. The problem specifies a yaw by $\\psi$ about the GLF axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{Z}}$ and a pitch by $\\alpha$ about the GLF axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}}$. Since the rotation axes belong to the fixed global frame, this describes a sequence of extrinsic (space-fixed) rotations. The problem states \"composition of the yaw... and the pitch\", implying the yaw rotation is performed first, followed by the pitch rotation.\n\nThe rotation matrix for a right-handed rotation by an angle $\\theta$ about the Z-axis is:\n$$C_Z(\\theta) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta & -\\sin\\theta & 0 \\\\ \\sin\\theta & \\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe rotation matrix for a right-handed rotation by an angle $\\phi$ about the Y-axis is:\n$$C_Y(\\phi) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\phi & 0 & \\sin\\phi \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin\\phi & 0 & \\cos\\phi \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFor an extrinsic rotation sequence, the composite rotation matrix is formed by pre-multiplying the rotation matrices in the order of application. Here, the sequence is yaw($\\psi$) then pitch($\\alpha$). The resulting transformation matrix $C$ is:\n$$C(\\alpha,\\psi) = C_Y(\\alpha) C_Z(\\psi)$$\n\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$C(\\alpha,\\psi) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\alpha & 0 & \\sin\\alpha \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\sin\\alpha & 0 & \\cos\\alpha \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\psi & -\\sin\\psi & 0 \\\\ \\sin\\psi & \\cos\\psi & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$C(\\alpha,\\psi) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n(\\cos\\alpha)(\\cos\\psi) + (0)(\\sin\\psi) + (\\sin\\alpha)(0) & (\\cos\\alpha)(-\\sin\\psi) + (0)(\\cos\\psi) + (\\sin\\alpha)(0) & (\\cos\\alpha)(0) + (0)(0) + (\\sin\\alpha)(1) \\\\\n(0)(\\cos\\psi) + (1)(\\sin\\psi) + (0)(0) & (0)(-\\sin\\psi) + (1)(\\cos\\psi) + (0)(0) & (0)(0) + (1)(0) + (0)(1) \\\\\n(-\\sin\\alpha)(\\cos\\psi) + (0)(\\sin\\psi) + (\\cos\\alpha)(0) & (-\\sin\\alpha)(-\\sin\\psi) + (0)(\\cos\\psi) + (\\cos\\alpha)(0) & (-\\sin\\alpha)(0) + (0)(0) + (\\cos\\alpha)(1)\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$C(\\alpha,\\psi) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\psi & -\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\psi & \\sin\\alpha \\\\\n\\sin\\psi & \\cos\\psi & 0 \\\\\n-\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\psi & \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\psi & \\cos\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is the required $3 \\times 3$ rotation matrix.\n\n#### 2. Transformation of Forces and Free Moments\n\nForce is a vector quantity. Therefore, the force vector $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$ measured in the FPF is transformed to the force vector $\\mathbf{F}_{G}$ in the GLF using the rotation matrix $C(\\alpha, \\psi)$:\n$$\\mathbf{F}_{G} = C(\\alpha,\\psi)\\,\\mathbf{F}_{L}$$\n\nThe problem specifies a \"free moment vector\" $\\mathbf{M}_{L}$. A moment vector transforms as a true vector under rotation, provided the moment is calculated about a common reference point. The problem explicitly states that \"the moment reference points coincide\". Under this condition, the moment vector $\\mathbf{M}_{L}$ in the FPF transforms to the moment vector $\\mathbf{M}_{G}$ in the GLF according to the same rotation rule:\n$$\\mathbf{M}_{G} = C(\\alpha,\\psi)\\,\\mathbf{M}_{L}$$\nSince the origins coincide, there is no additional term from the moment of the force (i.e., $\\mathbf{r} \\times \\mathbf{F}$ where $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{0}$). Thus, the global free moment $\\mathbf{M}_{G}$ depends only on $\\mathbf{M}_{L}$ and $C(\\alpha,\\psi)$, and has no dependence on $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$.\n\n#### 3. Validation with a Static Load Case\n\nThe subject has a mass of $m = 83.4$ kg and is subject to gravity $g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$. The weight is $W = m g$.\n$$W = 83.4 \\times 9.81 = 818.154 \\, \\text{N}$$\nThe global ground reaction force is purely vertical:\n$$\\mathbf{F}_{G} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ W \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFirst, we predict the local force $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$ that would be measured by the force plate. The transformation is $\\mathbf{F}_{G} = C \\mathbf{F}_{L}$, so the inverse transformation is $\\mathbf{F}_{L} = C^{-1} \\mathbf{F}_{G}$. Since $C$ is a rotation matrix, it is orthogonal, meaning $C^{-1} = C^T$.\n$$C^T(\\alpha,\\psi) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\psi & \\sin\\psi & -\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\psi \\\\\n-\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\psi & \\cos\\psi & \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\psi \\\\\n\\sin\\alpha & 0 & \\cos\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow we compute $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$:\n$$\\mathbf{F}_{L} = C^T \\mathbf{F}_{G} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\alpha\\cos\\psi & \\sin\\psi & -\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\psi \\\\\n-\\cos\\alpha\\sin\\psi & \\cos\\psi & \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\psi \\\\\n\\sin\\alpha & 0 & \\cos\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ W \\end{pmatrix} = W \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin\\alpha\\cos\\psi \\\\ \\sin\\alpha\\sin\\psi \\\\ \\cos\\alpha \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is the force vector that would be measured in the FPF.\n\nNext, we transform this local force $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$ back to the GLF to recover the global force, let's call it $\\mathbf{F}_{G,\\text{rec}}$.\n$$\\mathbf{F}_{G,\\text{rec}} = C \\mathbf{F}_{L}$$\nBy construction, $\\mathbf{F}_{G,\\text{rec}} = C (C^T \\mathbf{F}_{G}) = (C C^T) \\mathbf{F}_{G} = I \\mathbf{F}_{G} = \\mathbf{F}_{G}$, where $I$ is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix.\nThis confirms that the round-trip transformation recovers the original global force vector, independent of the angles $\\alpha$ and $\\psi$.\n$$\\mathbf{F}_{G,\\text{rec}} = \\mathbf{F}_{G} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ W \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe problem asks for the recovered global vertical force component, which is the Z-component of $\\mathbf{F}_{G,\\text{rec}}$.\n$$(F_{G,\\text{rec}})_Z = W = 818.154 \\, \\text{N}$$\nThe problem requests the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$818.154 \\to 818.2$$\nThe recovered global vertical force component is $818.2$ N.",

            "problem": "During stair ascent in the pull-up phase, model the combined shank-foot as a single rigid body moving in the sagittal plane. Use a right-handed laboratory coordinate system with the $x$-axis pointing anteriorly (forward), the $y$-axis pointing superiorly (upward), and the $z$-axis pointing laterally out of the sagittal plane. Let the knee joint center be the proximal reference point at position $\\mathbf{r}_k = (0,0)$, and define counterclockwise moments about the $z$-axis as positive.\n\nAt a specific instant, the following quantities are measured or estimated:\n- The Ground Reaction Force (GRF) vector at the shoe-ground Center of Pressure (COP) is $\\mathbf{R} = (80,\\,850)$ in newtons.

Express your final result in newton meters. Round your answer to three significant figures. State your answer with the specified sign convention (counterclockwise positive).",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of rigid body dynamics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed objectively. A unique solution can be determined.\n\nThe solution requires the application of the Newton-Euler equations for a rigid body undergoing planar motion. We aim to compute the net internal knee joint moment, $M_k$, acting on the combined shank-foot segment. The most direct method is to sum the moments about the knee joint center, $K$, which is a fixed point in the specified laboratory coordinate system ($\\mathbf{r}_k = (0,0)$).\n\nEuler's second law for a rigid body in planar motion, with moments summed about a fixed point $O$, states that the sum of external moments about $O$ equals the time rate of change of the angular momentum about $O$. This can be expressed as:\n$$ \\sum \\mathbf{M}_O = \\mathbf{r}_{g/O} \\times (m\\mathbf{a}_g) + I_g \\alpha_z \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{r}_{g/O}$ is the position vector of the center of mass ($G$) relative to point $O$, $m$ is the mass of the body, $\\mathbf{a}_g$ is the linear acceleration of the center of mass, $I_g$ is the mass moment of inertia about the center of mass, $\\alpha_z$ is the angular acceleration about the $z$-axis, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the unit vector in the $z$-direction.\n\nIn this problem, we sum moments about the knee joint center $K$, which is the origin of our coordinate system. So, point $O$ is $K$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\sum \\mathbf{M}_K = \\mathbf{r}_{g/K} \\times (m\\mathbf{a}_g) + I_g \\alpha_z \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nThe external loads on the shank-foot segment are the Ground Reaction Force ($\\mathbf{R}$) at the Center of Pressure (COP), the weight of the segment ($\\mathbf{W}$) at its center of mass ($G$), and the net joint resultant at the knee. The knee joint resultant consists of a force $\\mathbf{F}_k$ acting at the knee joint center $K$ and a pure moment (couple) $M_k$.\n\nThe sum of the external moments about the knee joint, $\\sum \\mathbf{M}_K$, is therefore:\n$$ \\sum \\mathbf{M}_K = (\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{cop}/K} \\times \\mathbf{R}) + (\\mathbf{r}_{g/K} \\times \\mathbf{W}) + (\\mathbf{r}_{k/K} \\times \\mathbf{F}_k) + M_k \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nSince the knee force $\\mathbf{F}_k$ is applied at the point $K$, its position vector relative to $K$ is $\\mathbf{r}_{k/K} = \\mathbf{0}$. Thus, the moment produced by $\\mathbf{F}_k$ about $K$ is zero. The equation for the sum of external moments simplifies to:\n$$ \\sum \\mathbf{M}_K = (\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{cop}/K} \\times \\mathbf{R}) + (\\mathbf{r}_{g/K} \\times \\mathbf{W}) + M_k \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\sum \\mathbf{M}_K$:\n$$ (\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{cop}/K} \\times \\mathbf{R}) + (\\mathbf{r}_{g/K} \\times \\mathbf{W}) + M_k \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = \\mathbf{r}_{g/K} \\times (m\\mathbf{a}_g) + I_g \\alpha_z \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown knee moment, $M_k$:\n$$ M_k \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = \\left( \\mathbf{r}_{g/K} \\times m\\mathbf{a}_g \\right) - \\left( \\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{cop}/K} \\times \\mathbf{R} \\right) - \\left( \\mathbf{r}_{g/K} \\times \\mathbf{W} \\right) + I_g \\alpha_z \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} $$\nSince all vectors lie in the $xy$-plane, the cross products result in vectors along the $z$-axis. We can write a scalar equation for the $z$-components. For any two vectors in the plane $\\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_y)$ and $\\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y)$, the $z$-component of their cross product is $(\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v})_z = u_x v_y - u_y v_x$.\nThe scalar equation for $M_k$ is:\n$$ M_k = (\\mathbf{r}_{g/K} \\times m\\mathbf{a}_g)_z - (\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{cop}/K} \\times \\mathbf{R})_z - (\\mathbf{r}_{g/K} \\times \\mathbf{W})_z + I_g \\alpha_z $$\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n- Mass: $m = 4.5$ kg\n- Position vectors relative to the knee ($K$):\n  - $\\mathbf{r}_{g/K} = (0.10, -0.32)$ m\n  - $\\mathbf{r}_{\\mathrm{cop}/K} = (0.07, -0.46)$ m\n- Force and acceleration vectors:\n  - $\\mathbf{R} = (80, 850)$ N\n  - $\\mathbf{a}_g = (0.40, 1.00)$ m/s$^2$\n  - The weight vector is $\\mathbf{W} = m\\mathbf{g} = (4.5 \\text{ kg}) \\times (0, -9.81 \\text{ m/s}^2) = (0, -44.145)$ N.\n- Inertial properties:\n  - $I_g = 0.12$ kg⋅m$^2$\n  - $\\alpha_z = 2.5$ rad/s$^2$\n\nWe calculate each term in the equation for $M_k$:\n$1$.

The problem states that the toe position is the sum of the ankle position, $\\mathbf{r}_a(t)$, and the rotated foot-segment vector, $R(\\alpha_0)\\mathbf{d}$.\nThe ankle position is given by the linear functions:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_a(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_a(t) \\\\ z_a(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 + v_x t \\\\ z_0 + v_z t \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe foot pitch angle is constant at $\\alpha(t) = \\alpha_0$. The rotation matrix $R(\\alpha_0)$ transforms the foot-frame toe offset vector $\\mathbf{d} = \\begin{pmatrix} d_x \\\\ d_z \\end{pmatrix}$ into the global coordinate frame:\n$$\nR(\\alpha_0) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha_0) & -\\sin(\\alpha_0) \\\\ \\sin(\\alpha_0) & \\cos(\\alpha_0) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rotated offset vector is:\n$$\nR(\\alpha_0)\\mathbf{d} = \\begin{pmatrix} d_x\\cos(\\alpha_0) - d_z\\sin(\\alpha_0) \\\\ d_x\\sin(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\cos(\\alpha_0) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe toe position vector $\\mathbf{r}_t(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x_t(t) \\\\ z_t(t) \\end{pmatrix}$ is then:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_t(t) = \\mathbf{r}_a(t) + R(\\alpha_0)\\mathbf{d} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_0 + v_x t \\\\ z_0 + v_z t \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} d_x\\cos(\\alpha_0) - d_z\\sin(\\alpha_0) \\\\ d_x\\sin(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\cos(\\alpha_0) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFrom this, we can write the explicit component equations for the toe's trajectory:\n$$\nx_t(t) = x_0 + v_x t + d_x\\cos(\\alpha_0) - d_z\\sin(\\alpha_0)\n$$\n$$\nz_t(t) = z_0 + v_z t + d_x\\sin(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\cos(\\alpha_0)\n$$\nNext, we must find the time $t^{\\ast}$ at which the toe's horizontal position is zero. We set $x_t(t^{\\ast}) = 0$:\n$$\n0 = x_0 + v_x t^{\\ast} + d_x\\cos(\\alpha_0) - d_z\\sin(\\alpha_0)\n$$\nSolving for $t^{\\ast}$, we get:\n$$\nv_x t^{\\ast} = -x_0 - d_x\\cos(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\sin(\\alpha_0)\n$$\nSince $v_x > 0$ is given, we can divide by $v_x$:\n$$\nt^{\\ast} = \\frac{-x_0 - d_x\\cos(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\sin(\\alpha_0)}{v_x}\n$$\nNow, we find the vertical position of the toe at this specific time, $z_t(t^{\\ast})$, by substituting the expression for $t^{\\ast}$ into the equation for $z_t(t)$:\n$$\nz_t(t^{\\ast}) = z_0 + v_z t^{\\ast} + d_x\\sin(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\cos(\\alpha_0)\n$$\n$$\nz_t(t^{\\ast}) = z_0 + v_z \\left( \\frac{-x_0 - d_x\\cos(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\sin(\\alpha_0)}{v_x} \\right) + d_x\\sin(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\cos(\\alpha_0)\n$$\nExpanding the term with $v_z$:\n$$\nz_t(t^{\\ast}) = z_0 - \\frac{v_z x_0}{v_x} - \\frac{v_z d_x\\cos(\\alpha_0)}{v_x} + \\frac{v_z d_z\\sin(\\alpha_0)}{v_x} + d_x\\sin(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\cos(\\alpha_0)\n$$\nFinally, we compute the toe clearance margin $M$ using its definition, $M = z_t(t^{\\ast}) - h$:\n$$\nM = \\left( z_0 - \\frac{v_z x_0}{v_x} - \\frac{v_z d_x\\cos(\\alpha_0)}{v_x} + \\frac{v_z d_z\\sin(\\alpha_0)}{v_x} + d_x\\sin(\\alpha_0) + d_z\\cos(\\alpha_0) \\right) - h\n$$\nTo present this in a more structured form, we can group the terms involving $d_x$ and $d_z$:\n$$\nM = z_0 - h - \\frac{v_z x_0}{v_x} + d_x \\left( \\sin(\\alpha_0) - \\frac{v_z}{v_x}\\cos(\\alpha_0) \\right) + d_z \\left( \\cos(\\alpha_0) + \\frac{v_z}{v_x}\\sin(\\alpha_0) \\right)\n$$\nThis expression gives the toe clearance margin $M$ solely in terms of the fundamental parameters provided in the problem statement: $x_0$, $v_x$, $z_0$, $v_z$, $d_x$, $d_z$, $\\alpha_0$, and $h$. This is the required closed-form analytic expression.",
