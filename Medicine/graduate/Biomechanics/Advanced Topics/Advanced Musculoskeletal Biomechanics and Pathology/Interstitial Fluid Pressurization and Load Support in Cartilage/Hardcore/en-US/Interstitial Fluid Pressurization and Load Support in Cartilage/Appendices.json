For slow, viscous flow through an isotropic porous medium, this drag force is proportional to the relative velocity between the phases, $\\mathbf{v}^f - \\mathbf{v}^s$. The drag law is commonly written as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{fs} = -K(\\mathbf{v}^f - \\mathbf{v}^s)\n$$\nwhere $K$ is a positive drag coefficient.

The top platen imposes a step axial displacement that instantaneously brings the specimen to a uniform engineering compressive strain $\\epsilon_{0}$ in the axial direction, after which the displacement is held constant for a long time until a steady state is reached.\n\nAssume the tissue can be modeled as a biphasic mixture composed of an incompressible interstitial fluid and a linearly elastic, isotropic solid matrix.

Analyze the Steady-State Condition**\nIn a biphasic material, a \"steady state\" under a constant imposed strain is reached when all transient processes, namely the flow of interstitial fluid, have ceased. Fluid flow, described by Darcy's law ($\\mathbf{q} \\propto \\nabla p$), is driven by pressure gradients. Therefore, at steady state, the fluid flux $\\mathbf{q}$ must be zero everywhere within the specimen.\nFor a material with non-zero permeability, $\\mathbf{q} = \\mathbf{0}$ implies that the pressure gradient must be zero: $\\nabla p = \\mathbf{0}$. This means the interstitial fluid pressure $p$ is spatially uniform.\nThe problem states that the specimen is loaded between perfectly porous platens, which are in contact with an external bath at a reference pressure of $p=0$. This boundary condition, combined with the fact that $p$ must be uniform throughout the specimen at steady state, leads to the conclusion that the interstitial fluid pressure is zero everywhere: $p(t \\to \\infty) = 0$.\nThis answers the explanatory part of the question: at long times (steady state), the fluid has fully redistributed, and its pressure has equilibrated with the external bath. Since the fluid pressure is zero, it no longer supports any portion of the applied load.\n\n**2.
