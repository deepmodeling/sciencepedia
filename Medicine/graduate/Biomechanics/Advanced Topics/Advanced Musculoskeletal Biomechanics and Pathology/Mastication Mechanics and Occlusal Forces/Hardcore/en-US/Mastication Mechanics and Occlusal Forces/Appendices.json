By applying the principles of static equilibrium in a two-dimensional model, you will determine the required muscle activation levels to perform a specific biting task.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the axial displacement of a human premolar, modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom linear elastic system, and the computation of this displacement for two different stiffness conditions. The analysis is based on the principles of quasi-static mechanics and linear elasticity.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing physical relationship from first principles. The problem models the tooth-periodontium system as a linear spring. For a linear spring, Hooke's Law states that the restorative force, $F_{\\text{spring}}$, is directly proportional to the displacement, $\\delta$, from its equilibrium position. The constant of proportionality is the spring stiffness, $k$.\n$$F_{\\text{spring}} = k \\delta$$\nThe load is applied quasi-statically, which means the process is slow enough that any dynamic or inertial effects ($F=ma$) can be neglected. Under this condition, the system is considered to be in equilibrium at all times. For equilibrium, the sum of all forces acting on the tooth must be zero. The external applied occlusal load, $F$, must be balanced by the internal restorative force from the periodontal ligament (PDL), $F_{\\text{spring}}$.\n$$F = F_{\\text{spring}}$$\nBy combining these two equations, we obtain the relationship between the applied load, the stiffness, and the displacement:\n$$F = k \\delta$$\nSolving for the axial displacement, $\\delta$, we derive the required expression:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{F}{k}$$\nThis expression will be used to calculate the displacement for both scenarios.\n\nFor the first part of the problem, we calculate the axial displacement for the baseline state.
