            "introduction": "Understanding the mechanical demands placed on the ankle during activities like walking and running begins with quantifying the moments generated by external forces. The primary external force is the Ground Reaction Force (GRF), and its moment about the ankle dictates the internal response required from muscles and ligaments. This practice  provides a fundamental exercise in applying vector mechanics to compute the external ankle moment from GRF and Center of Pressure data, a cornerstone calculation in inverse dynamics.",

            "problem": "A right foot is modeled in a laboratory right-handed coordinate system with origin at the ankle joint center. The axes are defined as follows: $x$ points anterior, $y$ points superior, and $z$ points lateral (to the right). The external Ground Reaction Force (GRF) vector, measured at an instant during stance, is given in this coordinate system as $\\boldsymbol{F}=\\big(F_{x},F_{y},F_{z}\\big)=\\big(-120,950,-30\\big)$, in units of Newtons. The Center of Pressure (CoP) position relative to the ankle joint center is $\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\text{CoP}}-\\boldsymbol{r}_{A}=\\big(0.19,-0.045,0.015\\big)$, in units of meters. Using Newton’s laws and the definition of the moment of a force about a point, compute the external ankle moment vector due to the GRF about the ankle joint center and extract the scalar component about the mediolateral axis (the $z$-axis). Adopt the right-hand rule for moment direction and the following sign convention for interpretation: a positive moment about the $+z$-axis tends to dorsiflex the foot, and a negative moment tends to plantarflex the foot. Express the requested scalar ankle moment component in Newton-meter ($\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$) and round your answer to four significant figures. In your reasoning, explicitly justify the sign of the computed moment using the stated sign convention. Do not compute any internal moments; only the external moment due to the GRF is required.",
            "solution": "The external moment $\\boldsymbol{M}$ generated by a force $\\boldsymbol{F}$ applied at a point with position vector $\\boldsymbol{r}$ relative to a pivot point is defined by the cross product of $\\boldsymbol{r}$ and $\\boldsymbol{F}$. In this problem, the pivot point is the ankle joint center (the origin of the coordinate system), the force is the Ground Reaction Force $\\boldsymbol{F}$, and the position vector is the location of the Center of Pressure $\\boldsymbol{r}$.\n\nThe moment vector $\\boldsymbol{M}$ is thus given by:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M} = \\boldsymbol{r} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}\n$$\nThe components of the moment vector $\\boldsymbol{M} = (M_x, M_y, M_z)$ can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix formed by the unit vectors and the components of $\\boldsymbol{r}$ and $\\boldsymbol{F}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M} = \n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}} & \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}} & \\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}} \\\\\nr_x & r_y & r_z \\\\\nF_x & F_y & F_z\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= (r_y F_z - r_z F_y)\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}} - (r_x F_z - r_z F_x)\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}} + (r_x F_y - r_y F_x)\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}$ are the unit vectors along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively.\n\nThe problem asks for the scalar component of the ankle moment about the mediolateral axis, which is defined as the $z$-axis. This corresponds to the component $M_z$. From the cross product definition, the scalar component $M_z$ is:\n$$\nM_z = r_x F_y - r_y F_x\n$$\nThe given values are:\n- $r_x = 0.19 \\, \\text{m}$\n- $r_y = -0.045 \\, \\text{m}$\n- $F_x = -120 \\, \\text{N}$\n- $F_y = 950 \\, \\text{N}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $M_z$:\n$$\nM_z = (0.19) \\cdot (950) - (-0.045) \\cdot (-120)\n$$\nWe perform the multiplication for each term:\nThe first term, $r_x F_y$, is the moment component generated by the superior force component ($F_y$) acting at an anterior distance ($r_x$).\n$$\n(0.19) \\cdot (950) = 180.5 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n$$\nThe second term, $r_y F_x$, involves the anterior-posterior force component ($F_x$) acting at a superior-inferior distance ($r_y$).\n$$\n(-0.045) \\cdot (-120) = 5.4 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n$$\nNow, we compute the final value of $M_z$:\n$$\nM_z = 180.5 - 5.4 = 175.1 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $175.1$ already has four significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe sign of the computed moment component $M_z$ is positive. According to the problem's sign convention, \"a positive moment about the $+z$-axis tends to dorsiflex the foot\". Therefore, the external ground reaction force produces a dorsiflexion moment of magnitude $175.1 \\, \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$ about the ankle joint. This result is physically intuitive: the dominant vertical force component ($F_y = 950 \\, \\text{N}$) is acting anterior to the ankle joint ($r_x = 0.19 \\, \\text{m}$), which creates a strong tendency to rotate the foot upwards (dorsiflexion) around the mediolateral axis. The braking force ($F_x = -120 \\, \\text{N}$) acting below the ankle joint ($r_y = -0.045 \\, \\text{m}$) produces a smaller opposing plantarflexion moment, but the net effect is a strong dorsiflexion moment.",

Model the tendon as a linear elastic element within the small-strain regime with constant tendon stiffness $k_t$ and assume zero force at zero elongation. Let the elongation be $\\Delta \\ell$ at the end of the loading phase.

This energy is equivalent to the mechanical work done, $W_{\\text{in}}$, to elongate the tendon from an initial elongation of $0$ to a final elongation of $\\Delta \\ell$. The definition of mechanical work is the line integral of the force vector, $\\vec{F}$, over the displacement path, $d\\vec{s}$. For a one-dimensional system where the force and displacement are collinear, this simplifies to:\n$$W = \\int_{x_i}^{x_f} F(x) \\, dx$$\nHere, the displacement variable is the elongation, which we denote as $x$. The initial elongation is $x_i = 0$ and the final elongation is $x_f = \\Delta \\ell$. The problem states that the tendon behaves as a linear elastic element with stiffness $k_t$ and zero force at zero elongation. The force-elongation relationship is therefore given by Hooke's Law:\n$$F(x) = k_t x$$\nSubstituting this force function into the integral for work, we find the energy stored during the loading phase:\n$$E_{\\text{stored}} = W_{\\text{in}} = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta \\ell} k_t x \\, dx$$\nSince the tendon stiffness $k_t$ is assumed to be constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$E_{\\text{stored}} = k_t \\int_{0}^{\\Delta \\ell} x \\, dx$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$E_{\\text{stored}} = k_t \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta \\ell} = k_t \\left( \\frac{(\\Delta \\ell)^2}{2} - \\frac{0^2}{2} \\right)$$\nThis yields the first required expression, the elastic energy stored in the tendon at peak elongation $\\Delta \\ell$:\n$$E_{\\text{stored}} = \\frac{1}{2} k_t (\\Delta \\ell)^2$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the mechanical work returned to the ankle joint during unloading, $W_{\\text{out}}$.
