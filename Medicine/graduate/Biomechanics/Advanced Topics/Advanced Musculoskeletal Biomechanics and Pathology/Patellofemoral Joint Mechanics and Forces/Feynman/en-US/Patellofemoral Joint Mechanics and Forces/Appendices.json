A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe calculation of the patellofemoral joint reaction force, $R(\\theta)$, requires a two-step analysis based on the principles of static equilibrium.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Patellar Tendon Force, $F_T(\\theta)$**\n\nThe net external knee extension moment, $M_k(\\theta)$, is generated by the quadriceps muscle group and transmitted to the tibia via the patellar tendon. For an isometric contraction, the joint is in static rotational equilibrium. The internal moment generated by the patellar tendon force, $F_T(\\theta)$, acting at its moment arm, $r_t(\\theta)$, must balance the measured knee extension moment $M_k(\\theta)$.\n\nThe equilibrium equation for moments about the tibiofemoral joint center is:\n$$ \\sum M_{\\text{knee}} = M_k(\\theta) - F_T(\\theta) \\cdot r_t(\\theta) = 0 $$\nSolving for the magnitude of the patellar tendon force gives:\n$$ F_T(\\theta) = \\frac{M_k(\\theta)}{r_t(\\theta)} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Patellofemoral Joint Reaction Force, $R(\\theta)$**\n\nThe patella itself is modeled as a free body in static equilibrium. It is acted upon by three forces: the quadriceps tendon force, $\\vec{F}_Q$; the patellar tendon force, $\\vec{F}_T$; and the patellofemoral joint reaction force, $\\vec{R}$. Since the patella's mass is negligible, the vector sum of these forces is zero:\n$$ \\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_T + \\vec{R} = \\vec{0} $$\nThis implies that the reaction force $\\vec{R}$ must be equal and opposite to the resultant of the two tendon forces:\n$$ \\vec{R} = -(\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_T) $$\nThe magnitude of the reaction force, $R$, is therefore:\n$$ R = |\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_T| $$\nThe problem states the patella acts as a frictionless pulley. This means the tension is conserved across the patella, so the magnitudes of the quadriceps and patellar tendon forces are equal. Let's denote this common magnitude as $F_{\\text{tendon}}(\\theta)$.\n$$ |\\vec{F}_Q| = |\\vec{F}_T| = F_{\\text{tendon}}(\\theta) = F_T(\\theta) $$\nThe magnitude of the vector sum can be found using the law of cosines. The angle between the vectors $\\vec{F}_Q$ and $\\vec{F}_T$ is given as $\\phi(\\theta)$.\n$$ R^2 = |\\vec{F}_Q|^2 + |\\vec{F}_T|^2 + 2|\\vec{F}_Q||\\vec{F}_T|\\cos(\\phi(\\theta)) $$\nSubstituting $F_{\\text{tendon}}(\\theta)$ for the force magnitudes:\n$$ R^2 = F_{\\text{tendon}}^2(\\theta) + F_{\\text{tendon}}^2(\\theta) + 2F_{\\text{tendon}}^2(\\theta)\\cos(\\phi(\\theta)) $$\n$$ R^2 = 2F_{\\text{tendon}}^2(\\theta)(1 + \\cos(\\phi(\\theta))) $$\nUsing the half-angle identity $1 + \\cos(\\alpha) = 2\\cos^2(\\alpha/2)$:\n$$ R^2 = 2F_{\\text{tendon}}^2(\\theta) \\left(2\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\phi(\\theta)}{2}\\right)\\right) = 4F_{\\text{tendon}}^2(\\theta)\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\phi(\\theta)}{2}\\right) $$\nTaking the square root of both sides yields the magnitude of the reaction force:\n$$ R(\\theta) = 2 F_{\\text{tendon}}(\\theta) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\phi(\\theta)}{2}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_{\\text{tendon}}(\\theta) = F_T(\\theta)$ from Step 1, we obtain the final formula:\n$$ R(\\theta) = 2 \\left( \\frac{M_k(\\theta)}{r_t(\\theta)} \\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\phi(\\theta)}{2}\\right) $$\n\n**Calculations for each angle:**\n\n**Case 1: $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$**\nGiven: $M_{k}(30^{\\circ}) = 85~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$, $r_{t}(30^{\\circ}) = 0.045~\\text{m}$, $\\phi(30^{\\circ}) = 25^{\\circ}$.\n$$ R(30^{\\circ}) = 2 \\left( \\frac{85}{0.045} \\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{25^{\\circ}}{2}\\right) = 2 \\left( \\frac{85}{0.045} \\right) \\cos(12.5^{\\circ}) $$\n$$ R(30^{\\circ}) \\approx 2 \\cdot (1888.88...) \\cdot (0.976296...) \\approx 3688.13~\\text{N} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R(30^{\\circ}) = 3688~\\text{N}$.\n\n**Case 2: $\\theta = 60^{\\circ}$**\nGiven: $M_{k}(60^{\\circ}) = 120~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$, $r_{t}(60^{\\circ}) = 0.040~\\text{m}$, $\\phi(60^{\\circ}) = 45^{\\circ}$.\n$$ R(60^{\\circ}) = 2 \\left( \\frac{120}{0.040} \\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{45^{\\circ}}{2}\\right) = 2 \\cdot (3000) \\cdot \\cos(22.5^{\\circ}) $$\n$$ R(60^{\\circ}) \\approx 6000 \\cdot (0.923880...) \\approx 5543.28~\\text{N} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R(60^{\\circ}) = 5543~\\text{N}$.\n\n**Case 3: $\\theta = 90^{\\circ}$**\nGiven: $M_{k}(90^{\\circ}) = 110~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$, $r_{t}(90^{\\circ}) = 0.035~\\text{m}$, $\\phi(90^{\\circ}) = 65^{\\circ}$.\n$$ R(90^{\\circ}) = 2 \\left( \\frac{110}{0.035} \\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{65^{\\circ}}{2}\\right) = 2 \\left( \\frac{110}{0.035} \\right) \\cos(32.5^{\\circ}) $$\n$$ R(90^{\\circ}) \\approx 2 \\cdot (3142.857...) \\cdot (0.843391...) \\approx 5300.91~\\text{N} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $R(90^{\\circ}) = 5301~\\text{N}$.\n\nThe computed patellofemoral joint reaction forces for $\\theta=30^{\\circ}$, $60^{\\circ}$, and $90^{\\circ}$ are $3688~\\text{N}$, $5543~\\text{N}$, and $5301~\\text{N}$, respectively.",

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe solution is developed in three stages: first, determining the quadriceps tendon force; second, determining the patellofemoral joint reaction force; and third, propagating the uncertainty from the moment arm to the reaction force.\n\n**1. Quadriceps Tendon Force ($T$)**\n\nFor the knee joint to be in quasi-static equilibrium, the internal moment generated by the quadriceps muscle must balance the net external knee extension moment $M$. The internal moment is the product of the quadriceps tendon force, $T$, and its effective moment arm, $r$.\n\n$$M = T \\cdot r$$\n\nSolving for the tendon force $T$ gives:\n\n$$T = \\frac{M}{r}$$\n\n**2. Patellofemoral Joint Reaction Force ($R$)**\n\nThe patella is modeled as a frictionless pulley. This implies that the magnitude of the force in the quadriceps tendon is equal to the magnitude of the force in the patellar tendon, both of which are equal to $T$. These two forces, $\\vec{T}_{quad}$ and $\\vec{T}_{pat}$, act on the patella at an angle $\\phi$ to each other.\n\nThe patellofemoral joint reaction force, $\\vec{R}$, is the force exerted by the femoral condyles onto the articular surface of the patella. For equilibrium of the patella, $\\vec{R}$ must balance the vector sum of the two tendon forces.\n$$\\vec{R} + \\vec{T}_{quad} + \\vec{T}_{pat} = 0$$\nTherefore, the magnitude of the reaction force, $R$, is equal to the magnitude of the resultant of the two tendon forces, $|\\vec{T}_{quad} + \\vec{T}_{pat}|$.\n\nBy symmetry, the reaction force $\\vec{R}$ bisects the angle $\\phi$ between the two tendons. The magnitude $R$ can be found by summing the components of the tendon forces along the direction of $\\vec{R}$. Each tendon force vector makes an angle of $\\phi/2$ with the line of action of $\\vec{R}$.\n\n$$R = T \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right) + T \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right) = 2T \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $T$ from the first step into this equation to express $R$ as a function of the given parameters:\n\n$$R = 2\\left(\\frac{M}{r}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right)$$\nThis equation defines the patellofemoral joint reaction force $R$ as a function of the moment arm $r$, with $M$ and $\\phi$ being constants.\n\n**3. Uncertainty Propagation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the first-order propagated standard uncertainty in $R$, denoted $u_R$, arising from the standard uncertainty in $r$, denoted $u_r$. For a function $f(x)$ of a single variable $x$ with uncertainty $u_x$, the propagated uncertainty $u_f$ is given by:\n\n$$u_f = \\left| \\frac{df}{dx} \\right| u_x$$\n\nIn our case, the function is $R(r)$, and we need to compute $u_R = \\left| \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r} \\right| u_r$. We treat $M$ and $\\phi$ as constants.\n\nFirst, we find the partial derivative of $R$ with respect to $r$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left[ \\frac{2M \\cos(\\phi/2)}{r} \\right]$$\n\nSince $2M \\cos(\\phi/2)$ is a constant with respect to $r$, we have:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial r} = 2M \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(r^{-1}) = 2M \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\right) (-1 \\cdot r^{-2}) = - \\frac{2M \\cos(\\phi/2)}{r^2}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this derivative into the uncertainty propagation formula:\n\n$$u_R = \\left| - \\frac{2M \\cos(\\phi/2)}{r^2} \\right| u_r = \\frac{2M \\cos(\\phi/2)}{r^2} u_r$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $M = 40\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m}$\n-   $r = 0.040\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $u_r = 0.003\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\phi = \\pi/6\\,\\mathrm{rad}$\n\nFirst, we evaluate the term $\\cos(\\phi/2)$:\n$$\\frac{\\phi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi/6}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{12}\\,\\mathrm{rad}$$\nThe exact value is $\\cos(\\pi/12) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values into the expression for $u_R$:\n\n$$u_R = \\frac{2 \\times 40 \\times \\cos(\\pi/12)}{(0.040)^2} \\times 0.003$$\n\n$$u_R = \\frac{80 \\times \\cos(\\pi/12)}{0.0016} \\times 0.003$$\n\n$$u_R = 50000 \\times \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right) \\times 0.003$$\n\n$$u_R = 150 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{12}\\right)$$\n\nUsing the approximate numerical value for $\\cos(\\pi/12) \\approx 0.9659258$:\n\n$$u_R \\approx 150 \\times 0.9659258 \\approx 144.88887\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n\n$$u_R \\approx 145\\,\\mathrm{N}$$",
