We will derive the contact area $A$, the peak subsurface maximum shear stress $\\tau_{\\max}$, and the safety factor $S$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n-   Compressive load: $F = 600~\\text{N}$\n-   Radius of curvature: $R = 20~\\text{mm} = 0.02~\\text{m}$\n-   Reduced modulus: $E^{*} = 8~\\text{MPa} = 8 \\times 10^6~\\text{Pa}$\n-   Shear failure threshold: $\\tau_{\\text{fail}} = 1.0~\\text{MPa} = 1 \\times 10^6~\\text{Pa}$\n\n**1. Derivation and Calculation of Contact Radius and Area**\n\nAccording to Hertzian contact theory, the radius $a$ of the circular contact area between a sphere of radius $R$ and an elastic half-space under a normal load $F$ is given by:\n$$a = \\left( \\frac{3FR}{4E^{*}} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values in SI units:\n$$a = \\left( \\frac{3 \\cdot (600~\\text{N}) \\cdot (0.02~\\text{m})}{4 \\cdot (8 \\times 10^6~\\text{Pa})} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{36}{32 \\times 10^6} \\right)^{1/3}~\\text{m} = (1.125 \\times 10^{-6})^{1/3}~\\text{m}$$\n$$a \\approx 0.0104004~\\text{m}$$\nTo express this in millimeters:\n$$a \\approx 10.4004~\\text{mm}$$\n\nThe contact area $A$ is circular, so $A = \\pi a^2$. Using the value of $a$ in millimeters:\n$$A = \\pi (10.4004~\\text{mm})^2 \\approx 339.82~\\text{mm}^2$$\nThis is the first requested value.\n\n**2. Derivation and Calculation of Peak Subsurface Shear Stress**\n\nThe pressure distribution over the contact area is semi-ellipsoidal:\n$$p(r) = p_0 \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^2}$$\nwhere $p_0$ is the maximum contact pressure at the center of the contact area ($r=0$). The total force $F$ is the integral of this pressure distribution, which relates $F$ to $p_0$ by $F = \\frac{2}{3}\\pi a^2 p_0$. Rearranging for $p_0$:\n$$p_0 = \\frac{3F}{2\\pi a^2}$$\nSubstituting the values for $F$ and $a$:\n$$p_0 = \\frac{3 \\cdot (600~\\text{N})}{2\\pi (0.0104004~\\text{m})^2} \\approx \\frac{1800}{2\\pi(1.08168 \\times 10^{-4})}~\\text{Pa} \\approx 2.6485 \\times 10^6~\\text{Pa} = 2.6485~\\text{MPa}$$\n\nThe maximum shear stress in the material, $\\tau_{\\max}$, does not occur at the surface but at a certain depth below the surface. For Hertzian contact of a sphere, classical solutions show that the peak subsurface maximum shear stress is approximately proportional to the maximum contact pressure $p_0$. The specific proportionality constant and location depend on the Poisson's ratio $\\nu$ of the material. A standard, widely used result (for $\\nu \\approx 0.3$) is:\n$$\\tau_{\\max} \\approx 0.31 p_0$$\nThis maximum stress occurs at a depth of approximately $z \\approx 0.49a$. Using this classical approximation:\n$$\\tau_{\\max} \\approx 0.31 \\cdot (2.6485~\\text{MPa}) \\approx 0.82104~\\text{MPa}$$\nThis is the second requested value.\n\n**3. Safety Factor Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks whether the predicted $\\tau_{\\max}$ exceeds the failure threshold $\\tau_{\\text{fail}} = 1.0~\\text{MPa}$.\nComparing the values:\n$$ \\tau_{\\max} \\approx 0.82104~\\text{MPa}  \\tau_{\\text{fail}} = 1.0~\\text{MPa} $$\nThe predicted peak subsurface maximum shear stress does not exceed the cartilage shear failure threshold.\n\nThe safety factor $S$ is defined as the ratio of the failure stress to the maximum stress:\n$$S = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{fail}}}{\\tau_{\\max}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$S = \\frac{1.0~\\text{MPa}}{0.82104~\\text{MPa}} \\approx 1.21796$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer for $S$ to four significant figures.\n$$S \\approx 1.218$$",

The variance of $r(\\mathbf{x})$ is denoted by $\\sigma^2$. By definition, the variance of a random variable (or field) $X$ is given by $\\text{Var}(X) = \\langle (X - \\langle X \\rangle)^2 \\rangle$, where $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ represents the expectation or spatial averaging operator.\n\nFor the relative height process $r(\\mathbf{x}) = z_{2}(\\mathbf{x}) - z_{1}(\\mathbf{x})$, the composite variance is:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\text{Var}(r) = \\langle (r - \\langle r \\rangle)^2 \\rangle\n$$\nFirst, we compute the mean of the relative height, $\\langle r \\rangle$. Using the linearity of the averaging operator:\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle = \\langle z_{2}(\\mathbf{x}) - z_{1}(\\mathbf{x}) \\rangle = \\langle z_{2}(\\mathbf{x}) \\rangle - \\langle z_{1}(\\mathbf{x}) \\rangle\n$$\nThe problem statement specifies that the surface topographies are zero-mean random fields, so $\\langle z_{1} \\rangle = 0$ and $\\langle z_{2} \\rangle = 0$. Therefore, the mean of the relative height is also zero:\n$$\n\\langle r \\rangle = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nWith a zero mean, the expression for the variance simplifies to the mean square of the process:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\langle (r - 0)^2 \\rangle = \\langle r^2 \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $r(\\mathbf{x})$:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\langle (z_{2}(\\mathbf{x}) - z_{1}(\\mathbf{x}))^2 \\rangle\n$$\nExpanding the square within the averaging operator:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\langle z_{2}(\\mathbf{x})^2 - 2 z_{1}(\\mathbf{x}) z_{2}(\\mathbf{x}) + z_{1}(\\mathbf{x})^2 \\rangle\n$$\nAgain, using the linearity of the averaging operator:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\langle z_{2}^2 \\rangle - 2 \\langle z_{1} z_{2} \\rangle + \\langle z_{1}^2 \\rangle\n$$\nNow, we relate these terms to the given definitions. The RMS roughness $\\sigma_{i}$ is defined as $\\sigma_{i} = \\sqrt{\\langle z_{i}^{2} \\rangle}$. Since the mean $\\langle z_{i} \\rangle$ is zero, the variance of each surface height profile is $\\text{Var}(z_{i}) = \\langle (z_i - \\langle z_i \\rangle)^2 \\rangle = \\langle z_{i}^{2} \\rangle = \\sigma_{i}^2$.\nThus, we have $\\langle z_{1}^2 \\rangle = \\sigma_{1}^2$ and $\\langle z_{2}^2 \\rangle = \\sigma_{2}^2$.\n\nThe term $\\langle z_{1} z_{2} \\rangle$ is the covariance between the two height fields, since their means are zero. The problem provides the cross-correlation coefficient $\\rho = \\frac{\\langle z_{1} z_{2} \\rangle}{\\sigma_{1} \\sigma_{2}}$. Rearranging this gives an expression for the covariance term:\n$$\n\\langle z_{1} z_{2} \\rangle = \\rho \\sigma_{1} \\sigma_{2}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\sigma_{2}^2 - 2(\\rho \\sigma_{1} \\sigma_{2}) + \\sigma_{1}^2\n$$\nRearranging for conventional ordering gives the expression for the composite variance:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2 - 2\\rho \\sigma_{1} \\sigma_{2}\n$$\nThe composite roughness $\\sigma$ is the square root of this variance:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2 - 2\\rho \\sigma_{1} \\sigma_{2}}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation. This expression generalizes the common assumption of uncorrelated surfaces (where $\\rho=0$, yielding $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2}$) to account for statistical correlation between the mating topographies.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of the Film Parameter $\\lambda$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\sigma_{1} = 18\\,\\text{nm}$\n- $\\sigma_{2} = 32\\,\\text{nm}$\n- $\\rho = 0.25$\n- $h = 37\\,\\text{nm}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the composite roughness $\\sigma$ using the derived formula.

The numerical approximation of the integral is:\n$$ I \\approx \\sum_{i=0}^{N-2} \\frac{W_{i+1}|U_{i+1}| + W_i|U_i|}{2} (t_{i+1} - t_i) $$\nThe total wear volume in SI units is then:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{SI}} \\approx \\frac{k}{H} \\times I $$\nThe final result must be in cubic millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}^3$). Using the conversion factor $1 \\ \\mathrm{m}^3 = 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{mm}^3$, we obtain:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{mm}^3} = V_{\\mathrm{SI}} \\times 10^9 $$\nThe algorithm for each test case is as follows:\n1. For the given arrays of time $\\mathbf{t}$, load $\\mathbf{W}$, and speed $\\mathbf{U}$, first compute the value of the integrand, $f_i = W_i |U_i|$, at each time sample $i$.\n2. Use the composite trapezoidal rule to numerically integrate the resulting array of integrand values with respect to the time samples $\\mathbf{t}$. This can be efficiently performed using library functions such as `numpy.trapz`.\n3. Multiply the result of the integration by the wear constant ratio $k/H$.\n4. Convert the resulting wear volume from cubic meters to cubic millimeters by multiplying by $10^9$.\n5. Round the final value to $6$ decimal places as required.\nThis procedure is applied to each of the four test cases to generate the final output.",
