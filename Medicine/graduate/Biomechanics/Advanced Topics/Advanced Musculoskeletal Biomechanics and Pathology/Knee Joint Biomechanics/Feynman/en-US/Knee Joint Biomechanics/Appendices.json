            "problem": "A posterior drawer test is performed at approximately $90^{\\circ}$ knee flexion on a healthy adult. The tibia is constrained to undergo pure posterior translation relative to the femur, with negligible rotation. Assume that the Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) is the only structure resisting posterior tibial translation.

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be subjected to a rigorous validation process before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data, variables, and conditions provided in the problem statement are as follows:\n- A posterior drawer test is performed at approximately $90^{\\circ}$ knee flexion.\n- The tibia undergoes pure posterior translation relative to the femur.\n- Rotational motion is negligible.\n- The Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) is the only structure resisting posterior tibial translation.\n- The PCL's line of action is straight and oriented at an angle $\\theta$ relative to the anterior-posterior tibial axis.\n- The displacement is small, and the orientation angle $\\theta$ can be considered fixed.\n- The test is conducted quasi-statically (inertial effects are negligible).\n- The PCL is modeled as a linear elastic element in the small-strain regime.\n- The PCL has a constant stiffness $k_{\\text{PCL}}$ along its fiber direction.\n- An external posterior force of magnitude $F_{\\text{post}}$ is applied to the tibia.\n- Given value for the angle: $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$.\n- Given value for the applied force: $F_{\\text{post}} = 125 \\ \\text{N}$.\n- Given value for the PCL stiffness: $k_{\\text{PCL}} = 180 \\ \\text{N/mm}$.\n- The final result for posterior tibial translation, $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$, should be in millimeters (mm) and rounded to four significant figures.\n- Contributions from other specified anatomical structures are to be neglected.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on the principles of static mechanics and linear elasticity, which are standard tools for introductory biomechanical analysis. The PCL is indeed the primary restraint to posterior tibial translation, and modeling it as a linear spring for small displacements is a common and valid simplification. The provided numerical values for force ($125$ N), stiffness ($180$ N/mm), and angle ($30^{\\circ}$) are physiologically plausible for this scenario.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear objective (calculate $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$) and sufficient information to obtain a unique, stable solution. The assumptions (e.g., PCL as the sole resistor, pure translation, quasi-static conditions) simplify the system appropriately to make it determinable.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective or opinion-based claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The setup is self-contained. The given parameters are sufficient for the calculation. The units are explicit and consistent. There are no contradictions.\n- **Realism and Feasibility:** While a simplification of the complex in-vivo reality, the model is a standard and scientifically reasonable idealization used for educational and research purposes. It does not violate physical laws or require infeasible conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. A solution will now be derived from first principles.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the posterior tibial translation, $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$, under a posterior force, $F_{\\text{post}}$. The system is in quasi-static equilibrium, meaning the net force on the tibia is zero. The applied posterior force is balanced by the restoring force generated by the PCL.\n\nLet's define a coordinate system where the posterior direction along the tibial axis is the positive x-axis. The applied force is a vector $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{post}} = F_{\\text{post}} \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$. The PCL is oriented at an angle $\\theta$ relative to this axis. The force exerted by the PCL on the tibia, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{PCL}}$, is a tensile force directed along the ligament's fibers, opposing the stretch. Thus, it has a component that acts in the anterior direction (negative x-direction).\n\nThe static equilibrium equation in the anterior-posterior direction is:\n$$ \\sum F_x = 0 $$\n$$ F_{\\text{post}} - F_{\\text{PCL,x}} = 0 $$\nwhere $F_{\\text{PCL,x}}$ is the component of the PCL force along the posterior axis. The total PCL force magnitude is $F_{\\text{PCL}}$. Its component resisting the posterior drawer is $F_{\\text{PCL,x}} = F_{\\text{PCL}} \\cos(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the equilibrium equation gives:\n$$ F_{\\text{post}} = F_{\\text{PCL}} \\cos(\\theta) \\quad (1) $$\n\nThe PCL is modeled as a linear elastic element (a spring) with stiffness $k_{\\text{PCL}}$. The magnitude of the force in the PCL is governed by its constitutive law, which is analogous to Hooke's Law:\n$$ F_{\\text{PCL}} = k_{\\text{PCL}} \\cdot \\delta_{\\text{PCL}} \\quad (2) $$\nwhere $\\delta_{\\text{PCL}}$ is the elongation of the PCL along its fiber direction.\n\nNext, we must establish the kinematic relationship between the posterior tibial translation, $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$, and the PCL elongation, $\\delta_{\\text{PCL}}$. The problem states that the tibial motion is a pure posterior translation of magnitude $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$. For a small displacement, the elongation of the PCL is the projection of the tibial translation vector onto the PCL's line of action.\nThe translation vector is $\\mathbf{\\delta} = \\delta_{\\text{post}} \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$. The unit vector along the PCL's direction is $\\mathbf{u}_{\\text{PCL}}$, which makes an angle $\\theta$ with the x-axis. The elongation is the scalar projection:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{PCL}} = \\mathbf{\\delta} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{\\text{PCL}} = |\\mathbf{\\delta}| |\\mathbf{u}_{\\text{PCL}}| \\cos(\\theta) $$\nSince $|\\mathbf{\\delta}| = \\delta_{\\text{post}}$ and $|\\mathbf{u}_{\\text{PCL}}| = 1$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{PCL}} = \\delta_{\\text{post}} \\cos(\\theta) \\quad (3) $$\n\nWe now have a system of three equations. We can solve for $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$ by substitution.\nSubstitute equation (3) into equation (2):\n$$ F_{\\text{PCL}} = k_{\\text{PCL}} (\\delta_{\\text{post}} \\cos(\\theta)) $$\nNow, substitute this expression for $F_{\\text{PCL}}$ into equation (1):\n$$ F_{\\text{post}} = (k_{\\text{PCL}} \\delta_{\\text{post}} \\cos(\\theta)) \\cos(\\theta) $$\n$$ F_{\\text{post}} = k_{\\text{PCL}} \\delta_{\\text{post}} \\cos^2(\\theta) $$\n\nWe can now isolate $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$ to find the final symbolic expression:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{post}}}{k_{\\text{PCL}} \\cos^2(\\theta)} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $F_{\\text{post}} = 125 \\ \\text{N}$\n- $k_{\\text{PCL}} = 180 \\ \\text{N/mm}$\n- $\\theta = 30^{\\circ}$\n\nThe value of $\\cos(30^{\\circ})$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Therefore, $\\cos^2(30^{\\circ}) = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\delta_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{125}{180 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)} = \\frac{125}{180 \\cdot 0.75} = \\frac{125}{135} $$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 25}{5 \\cdot 27} = \\frac{25}{27} \\text{ mm} $$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.9259259... \\text{ mm} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\delta_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.9259 \\text{ mm} $$\nThis is the calculated posterior tibial translation under the specified conditions.",

The angle $\\alpha$ is given as $6^\\circ$.\nThe first term is:\n$$k\\alpha = (0.0015\\,\\text{m}/\\text{deg}) \\cdot (6\\,\\text{deg}) = 0.009\\,\\text{m}$$\nFor the second term, $L\\sin(\\alpha)$, the trigonometric function $\\sin(\\alpha)$ requires the angle to be in radians. The shank length is $L = 0.44\\,\\text{m}$.\n$$\\alpha_{\\text{rad}} = 6^\\circ \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ} \\text{ rad}$$\nThe second term is:\n$$L\\sin(\\alpha) = 0.44\\,\\text{m} \\cdot \\sin\\left(6^\\circ\\right) \\approx 0.44\\,\\text{m} \\cdot 0.10452846 = 0.04599252\\,\\text{m}$$\nThe total change in the moment arm is:\n$$\\Delta d = 0.009\\,\\text{m} + 0.04599252\\,\\text{m} = 0.05499252\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the change in the adduction moment:\n$$\\Delta M_{\\text{add}} = F_y \\cdot \\Delta d = 841.038\\,\\text{N} \\cdot 0.05499252\\,\\text{m} \\approx 46.2505\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $46.3\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$.",
