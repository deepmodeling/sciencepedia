It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in muscle biomechanics. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total force generated by the muscle and transmitted to the tendon, $F_{tendon}$, is the sum of the active force ($F_{active}$) and passive force ($F_{passive}$) generated along the muscle fibers, projected onto the line of action of the tendon via the cosine of the pennation angle, $\\phi$.\n$$F_{tendon} = (F_{active} + F_{passive}) \\cos(\\phi)$$\nThe solution proceeds by calculating each component of this equation.\n\n**1. Normalized Fiber Length ($\\tilde{l}$)**\nThe fiber length is normalized by the optimal fiber length $l_0$.\n$$\\tilde{l} = \\frac{l}{l_0} = \\frac{0.110 \\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.105 \\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{22}{21} \\approx 1.04762$$\n\n**2. Active Force Component ($F_{active}$)**\nThe active force is a product of the maximum isometric force, activation level, and dimensionless factors for force-length ($f_{AL}$) and force-velocity ($f_V$) relationships.\n$$F_{active} = F_{\\max} \\cdot a \\cdot f_{AL}(\\tilde{l}) \\cdot f_V(v)$$\n\n**2a. Active Force-Length Factor ($f_{AL}$)**\nThe Gaussian relationship for the active force-length factor is:\n$$f_{AL}(\\tilde{l}) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(\\tilde{l}-1)^2}{w^2} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$f_{AL} = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(22/21 - 1)^2}{0.25^2} \\right) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{(1/21)^2}{(1/4)^2} \\right) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1/441}{1/16} \\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{16}{441}\\right)$$\n$$f_{AL} \\approx 0.964370$$\n\n**2b. Force-Velocity Factor ($f_V$)**\nFirst, we calculate the maximum shortening velocity, $V_{\\max}$:\n$$V_{\\max} = 12 \\cdot l_0 = 12 \\cdot 0.105 \\ \\mathrm{m/s} = 1.26 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe force-velocity factor for a concentric contraction ($v>0$) based on the classical Hill equation, parameterized by $c$, is:\n$$f_V(v) = \\frac{(1+c)(c V_{\\max})}{v + c V_{\\max}} - c$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$c V_{\\max} = 0.25 \\cdot 1.26 \\ \\mathrm{m/s} = 0.315 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\n$$f_V = \\frac{(1+0.25)(0.315)}{0.420 + 0.315} - 0.25 = \\frac{1.25 \\cdot 0.315}{0.735} - 0.25$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$f_V = \\frac{15}{28} - \\frac{7}{28} = \\frac{8}{28} = \\frac{2}{7} \\approx 0.285714$$\n\n**2c. Calculation of $F_{active}$**\nNow we combine the factors to find the active force:\n$$F_{active} = 850 \\ \\mathrm{N} \\cdot 0.600 \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{16}{441}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2}{7}$$\n$$F_{active} \\approx 510 \\ \\mathrm{N} \\cdot 0.964370 \\cdot 0.285714 \\approx 140.5225 \\ \\mathrm{N}$$\n\n**3. Passive Force Component ($F_{passive}$)**\nThe passive force is calculated using the provided exponential relationship. Since $\\tilde{l} > 1$, the muscle is stretched beyond its slack length (assumed to be $l_0$), and passive force is generated.\n$$F_{passive} = F_{\\max} \\cdot k_p \\left( \\exp \\left( k_{pe}(\\tilde{l}-1) \\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$F_{passive} = 850 \\ \\mathrm{N} \\cdot 0.02 \\left( \\exp \\left( 4.0\\left(\\frac{22}{21}-1\\right) \\right) - 1 \\right) = 17 \\ \\mathrm{N} \\cdot \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{4}{21}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\n$$F_{passive} \\approx 17 \\ \\mathrm{N} \\cdot (1.209822 - 1) \\approx 3.56698 \\ \\mathrm{N}$$\n\n**4. Pennation Angle ($\\phi$)**\nThe constant-thickness pennation model is described by $l \\sin(\\phi) = l_0 \\sin(\\phi_0)$. First, we convert the initial pennation angle $\\phi_0$ to radians.\n$$\\phi_0 = 5^{\\circ} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\ \\mathrm{rad}$$\nThe instantaneous pennation angle $\\phi$ is found by:\n$$\\sin(\\phi) = \\frac{l_0}{l} \\sin(\\phi_0) = \\frac{0.105}{0.110} \\sin\\left(5^{\\circ}\\right) = \\frac{21}{22} \\sin\\left(5^{\\circ}\\right)$$\n$$\\sin(\\phi) \\approx \\frac{21}{22} \\cdot 0.087156 \\approx 0.083204$$\nWe need $\\cos(\\phi)$ for the force projection:\n$$\\cos(\\phi) = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(\\phi)} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{21}{22} \\sin(5^{\\circ})\\right)^2}$$\n$$\\cos(\\phi) \\approx \\sqrt{1 - (0.083204)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.993077} \\approx 0.996532$$\n\n**5. Total Tendon Force ($F_{tendon}$)**\nFinally, we assemble the components to calculate the total force along the tendon.\nFirst, the total force along the fibers:\n$$F_{fiber} = F_{active} + F_{passive} \\approx 140.5225 \\ \\mathrm{N} + 3.56698 \\ \\mathrm{N} = 144.0895 \\ \\mathrm{N}$$\nThen, project this force onto the tendon axis:\n$$F_{tendon} = F_{fiber} \\cdot \\cos(\\phi) \\approx 144.0895 \\ \\mathrm{N} \\cdot 0.996532 \\approx 143.5855 \\ \\mathrm{N}$$\n\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as requested gives $143.6 \\ \\mathrm{N}$.",
