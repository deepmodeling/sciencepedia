            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear poroelasticity, is well-posed with sufficient initial and boundary conditions, and is stated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the instantaneous pore pressure distribution, $p(x, 0^{+})$, immediately following the application of a step strain at time $t=0$. The key physical principle governing the instantaneous response of a poroelastic medium is that it occurs under undrained conditions. This is because an infinite pressure gradient would be required to cause a finite amount of fluid flow in an infinitesimal time interval $\\Delta t \\to 0^{+}$. Therefore, at the instant $t=0^{+}$, there has been no macroscopic fluid transport relative to the solid matrix. This implies that the variation of fluid content, denoted by $\\zeta$, is zero everywhere within the material.\n\nThe constitutive relation for the variation of fluid content $\\zeta$ in a linear, isotropic poroelastic material is given by:\n$$\n\\zeta = \\alpha \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}) + \\frac{p}{M}\n$$\nHere, $\\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})$ is the trace of the small strain tensor of the solid matrix (i.e., the volumetric strain of the skeleton, $\\varepsilon_{kk}$), $p$ is the pore fluid pressure, $\\alpha$ is the Biot-Willis coefficient, and $M$ is the Biot modulus.\n\nApplying the undrained condition, $\\zeta(x, t=0^{+}) = 0$, to the constitutive relation, we have:\n$$\n0 = \\alpha \\text{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}(x, 0^{+})) + \\frac{p(x, 0^{+})}{M}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the nondimensional pore pressure field, defined as $\\tilde{p}(x, 0^{+}) = p(x, 0^{+}) / M$.

The problem statement provides the components of the strain tensor in a Cartesian coordinate system. The configuration is a confined compression test, where the axial direction is denoted by $x$.

The instruction to treat the poroelastic and viscoelastic responses as having \"independent\" time scales is a common and tractable simplification for identifying dominant physical regimes.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or non-scientific claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equations**\n\nWe begin from the fundamental principles for a 1D poroviscoelastic medium. We assume compressive stresses and strains are positive.\n\n1.  **Mass Conservation (Continuity Equation)**: For a mixture of incompressible solid and fluid constituents under small strain, the rate of change of volumetric strain of the solid skeleton, $\\epsilon(x,t)$, must be balanced by the divergence of the relative fluid-to-solid volume flux, $\\mathbf{w}$. In one dimension, this is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial w_x}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n    where $w_x$ is the $x$-component of the relative fluid flux.\n\n2.  **Darcy's Law**: The relative fluid flux is driven by the gradient of the pore pressure, $p(x,t)$:\n    $$ w_x = -\\frac{\\kappa}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} $$\n    where $\\kappa$ is the intrinsic permeability and $\\mu$ is the fluid viscosity. Substituting this into the continuity equation yields:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\kappa}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} $$\n\n3.  **Momentum Balance (Equilibrium)**: Neglecting inertial effects and body forces, the total stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ must be spatially uniform:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\sigma_{xx}}{\\partial x} = 0 \\implies \\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{xx}(t) $$\n\n4.  **Constitutive Relations**: The total stress $\\sigma_{xx}$ is the sum of the effective stress acting on the solid skeleton, $\\sigma'_{xx}$, and the pore pressure contribution. Using the convention that pore pressure adds to the compressive stress:\n    $$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma'_{xx} + p $$\n    The problem specifies the drained modulus $M$, relating the effective stress to the strain: $\\sigma'_{xx} = M\\epsilon$. This represents the purely elastic part of the solid response. The viscoelastic behavior of the Maxwell solid is captured by the relaxation time $\\tau_v$, which we will incorporate later when defining the effective relaxation time. For the initial derivation of the fluid diffusion problem, we consider the poroelastic response governed by $M$. Thus:\n    $$ \\sigma_{xx}(t) = M \\epsilon(x,t) + p(x,t) $$\n    This equation links the local strain, local pressure, and the time-dependent (but spatially uniform) total stress.\n\n5.  **Derivation of the Diffusion Problem for Pressure**:\n    From the constitutive relation, we express the local strain as:\n    $$ \\epsilon(x,t) = \\frac{1}{M} (\\sigma_{xx}(t) - p(x,t)) $$\n    Differentiating with respect to time:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{M} \\left( \\frac{d\\sigma_{xx}}{dt} - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} \\right) $$\n    Now, we equate the two expressions for $\\partial \\epsilon / \\partial t$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\kappa}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{M} \\left( \\frac{d\\sigma_{xx}}{dt} - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} \\right) $$\n    Rearranging gives a non-homogeneous diffusion equation for pressure:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{d\\sigma_{xx}}{dt} + \\frac{M\\kappa}{\\mu} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} $$\n    The term $d\\sigma_{xx}/dt$ is unknown. To find it, we use the constraint that the overall strain applied to the slab is fixed. The average strain across the thickness $h$ is given by $\\bar{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\epsilon(x,t) dx$. For $t>0$, this average strain is constant, $\\bar{\\epsilon} = \\epsilon_0$, so its time derivative is zero. Averaging the constitutive relation for strain gives $\\bar{\\epsilon} = (\\sigma_{xx} - \\bar{p})/M$, where $\\bar{p}$ is the average pressure. Differentiating this with respect to time gives $\\frac{d\\sigma_{xx}}{dt} = \\frac{d\\bar{p}}{dt}$.\n    Substituting this back gives the governing integro-partial differential equation for $p(x,t)$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = c_p \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{d\\bar{p}}{dt} \\quad \\text{where } c_p = \\frac{M\\kappa}{\\mu} $$\n    This is the governing diffusion problem for pressure under confined compression stress relaxation.\n\n**Boundary and Initial Conditions**\n-   **Boundary Conditions (BCs)**: The faces are drains at zero pressure: $p(\\pm h/2, t) = 0$ for $t > 0$.\n-   **Initial Condition (IC)**: At $t=0^+$, the strain $\\epsilon_0$ is applied instantaneously. The \"undrained\" condition means no fluid has time to move. This implies the initial strain field is uniform, $\\epsilon(x, 0^+) = \\epsilon_0$. From the constitutive relation $\\sigma_{xx} = M\\epsilon + p$, and equilibrium, the initial total stress is $\\sigma_{xx}(0^+) = M\\epsilon_0 + p_0$. As $\\epsilon_0$ is uniform, equilibrium requires $p_0$ to be uniform. This initial pressure is such that it supports the initial compressive strain.\n\n**Poroelastic Relaxation Time, $t_p(h)$**\nThe integro-differential equation is complex. However, the characteristic time scale for diffusion is governed by the length scale of the domain and the diffusion coefficient. The problem asks for the time scale of the slowest decaying mode, which can be found by analyzing the eigenspectrum of the standard diffusion operator, $c_p \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$. We solve the homogeneous problem $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = c_p \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2}$ with BCs $p(\\pm h/2, t) = 0$.\nThe solution is a series of decaying modes:\n$$ p(x,t) = \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} A_n \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{h}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_n}\\right) $$\nThe time constant $\\tau_n$ for each mode is given by:\n$$ \\tau_n = \\frac{1}{c_p} \\left(\\frac{h}{n\\pi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{h^2 \\mu}{n^2 \\pi^2 M \\kappa} $$\nThe slowest decaying mode corresponds to the smallest value of $n$, which is $n=1$. This gives the dominant poroelastic relaxation time, $t_p(h)$:\n$$ t_p(h) = \\tau_1 = \\frac{h^2 \\mu}{\\pi^2 M \\kappa} $$\n\n**Effective Relaxation Time, $t_c(h)$**\nThe problem describes two relaxation mechanisms:\n1.  Poroelastic relaxation due to fluid diffusion, with time scale $t_p(h)$.\n2.  Viscoelastic relaxation of the solid matrix, with intrinsic time scale $\\tau_v$.\n\nThe problem states that the effective relaxation time, $t_c(h)$, should be treated as the slowest (i.e., the largest) of these two independent time scales. Therefore, the effective relaxation time is the maximum of the two:\n$$ t_c(h) = \\max\\left(t_p(h), \\tau_v\\right) = \\max\\left(\\frac{h^2 \\mu}{\\pi^2 M \\kappa}, \\tau_v\\right) $$\n\n**Crossover Thickness, $h_{\\times}$**\nThe crossover between the poro-driven and visco-driven regimes occurs when the two characteristic time scales are equal, i.e., $t_p(h_{\\times}) = \\tau_v$.\n$$ \\frac{h_{\\times}^2 \\mu}{\\pi^2 M \\kappa} = \\tau_v $$\nSolving for the crossover thickness $h_{\\times}$:\n$$ h_{\\times}^2 = \\frac{\\pi^2 M \\kappa \\tau_v}{\\mu} \\implies h_{\\times} = \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{M \\kappa \\tau_v}{\\mu}} $$\n-   If $h \\ll h_{\\times}$, then $t_p(h) \\ll \\tau_v$, and the relaxation is dominated by the solid viscoelasticity ($t_c(h) = \\tau_v$).\n-   If $h \\gg h_{\\times}$, then $t_p(h) \\gg \\tau_v$, and the relaxation is dominated by poroelastic fluid flow ($t_c(h) = t_p(h)$).\n\nThe final requested output is the closed-form expression for $t_c(h)$.",

Maxwell Branch Components ($\\sigma'_{zz, i}$ for $i=1, 2$):**\nThe relaxation function for the $i$-th branch is $E_{i} \\exp(-t/\\tau_{i})$.\n$$\n\\sigma'_{zz, i}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} E_{i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-\\tau}{\\tau_{i}}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{0}}{T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau}{T}\\right)\\right) d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma'_{zz, i}(t) = -\\frac{E_{i}\\varepsilon_{0}}{T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right) \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp\\left(\\tau\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right)\\right) d\\tau\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to (assuming $\\tau_{i} \\neq T$):\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\exp\\left(\\tau\\left(\\frac{T-\\tau_{i}}{T\\tau_{i}}\\right)\\right) d\\tau = \\left[ \\frac{T\\tau_{i}}{T-\\tau_{i}} \\exp\\left(\\tau\\left(\\frac{T-\\tau_{i}}{T\\tau_{i}}\\right)\\right) \\right]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{T\\tau_{i}}{T-\\tau_{i}} \\left(\\exp\\left(t\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right)\\right) - 1\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{zz, i}(t) = -\\frac{E_{i}\\varepsilon_{0}}{T} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right) \\frac{T\\tau_{i}}{T-\\tau_{i}} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T}\\right) - 1\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma'_{zz, i}(t) = -E_{i}\\varepsilon_{0} \\frac{\\tau_{i}}{T-\\tau_{i}} \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n**Total Effective Stress:**\nThe total effective stress is the sum of the components:\n$$\n\\sigma'_{zz}(t) = -E_{\\infty}\\varepsilon_{0} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T}\\right)\\right) - \\sum_{i=1}^{2} E_{i}\\varepsilon_{0} \\frac{\\tau_{i}}{T-\\tau_{i}} \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{T}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nWe are given the parameters:\n$t = 120\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$\\varepsilon_{0} = 0.12$\n$T = 30\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$E_{\\infty} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n$E_{1} = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\tau_{1} = 12\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$E_{2} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\tau_{2} = 60\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nWe calculate each term at $t=120\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nExponential factors:\n$\\exp(-t/T) = \\exp(-120/30) = \\exp(-4)$\n$\\exp(-t/\\tau_{1}) = \\exp(-120/12) = \\exp(-10)$\n$\\exp(-t/\\tau_{2}) = \\exp(-120/60) = \\exp(-2)$\n\nTerm for $E_{\\infty}$:\n$\\sigma'_{zz, \\infty}(120) = -0.8 \\times 0.12 \\times (1 - \\exp(-4)) = -0.096 \\times (1 - \\exp(-4))$\n\nTerm for $E_{1}$:\n$\\sigma'_{zz, 1}(120) = -0.6 \\times 0.12 \\times \\frac{12}{30-12} (\\exp(-4) - \\exp(-10)) = -0.072 \\times \\frac{12}{18} (\\exp(-4) - \\exp(-10))$\n$\\sigma'_{zz, 1}(120) = -0.048 \\times (\\exp(-4) - \\exp(-10))$\n\nTerm for $E_{2}$:\n$\\sigma'_{zz, 2}(120) = -0.4 \\times 0.12 \\times \\frac{60}{30-60} (\\exp(-4) - \\exp(-2)) = -0.048 \\times \\frac{60}{-30} (\\exp(-4) - \\exp(-2))$\n$\\sigma'_{zz, 2}(120) = 0.096 \\times (\\exp(-4) - \\exp(-2))$\n\nNow we substitute the values of the exponentials:\n$\\exp(-2) \\approx 0.135335$\n$\\exp(-4) \\approx 0.0183156$\n$\\exp(-10) \\approx 4.53999 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\n$\\sigma'_{zz, \\infty}(120) = -0.096 \\times (1 - 0.0183156) = -0.096 \\times 0.9816844 \\approx -0.0942417\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n$\\sigma'_{zz, 1}(120) = -0.048 \\times (0.0183156 - 0.0000454) = -0.048 \\times 0.0182702 \\approx -0.00087697\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n$\\sigma'_{zz, 2}(120) = 0.096 \\times (0.0183156 - 0.135335) = 0.096 \\times (-0.1170194) \\approx -0.01123386\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n\nSumming the components:\n$\\sigma'_{zz}(120) = -0.0942417 - 0.00087697 - 0.01123386 = -0.10635253\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the average effective axial stress is $-0.1064\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.",
