It is a standard, solvable problem in biotransport.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe transport of the solute (glucose) is governed by the principle of conservation of mass. In its general form, the conservation equation for a solute with concentration $c$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = R\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{J}$ is the total flux vector and $R$ represents the volumetric rate of production or consumption of the solute.\n\nWe apply the assumptions specified in the problem to simplify this general equation:\n1.  **Steady-state:** The system does not change with time, so all time derivatives are zero. $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n2.  **One-dimensional transport:** The transport occurs only along the $x$-axis. Thus, the divergence of the flux vector simplifies to $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d} J_x}{\\mathrm{d} x}$. We denote the flux component in the $x$-direction as $J$.\n3.  **No volumetric sources or sinks:** The solute is nonreactive, so $R=0$.\n\nApplying these simplifications, the conservation equation reduces to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} J}{\\mathrm{d} x} = 0\n$$\nThis ordinary differential equation implies that the flux $J$ is constant throughout the slab, i.e., it does not vary with position $x$.\n\nThe problem states that we must use a linear phenomenological constitutive relation for diffusive flux. For a dilute solution with no convection, this is Fick's First Law of diffusion:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{\\mathrm{d} c}{\\mathrm{d} x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the effective diffusivity of the solute in the medium. The negative sign indicates that the net movement of solute is down the concentration gradient, from a region of higher concentration to one of lower concentration.\n\nSince $J$ is a constant, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d} c}{\\mathrm{d} x} = -\\frac{J}{D}\n$$\nThe problem states that $D$ is spatially uniform. Since $J$ is also constant, the concentration gradient $\\frac{\\mathrm{d} c}{\\mathrm{d} x}$ must be constant. Integrating this equation with respect to $x$ gives the concentration profile:\n$$\nc(x) = \\int \\left(-\\frac{J}{D}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{J}{D} x + C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration.\n\nWe determine the constants $J$ and $C_1$ by applying the boundary conditions:\n1.  At the vertebral interface ($x=0$): $c(0) = c_{\\mathrm{v}}$.\n2.  At the disc interface ($x=L$): $c(L) = c_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$\nc(0) = -\\frac{J}{D}(0) + C_1 = c_{\\mathrm{v}} \\implies C_1 = c_{\\mathrm{v}}\n$$\nSo the concentration profile is $c(x) = -\\frac{J}{D} x + c_{\\mathrm{v}}$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$\nc(L) = -\\frac{J}{D} L + c_{\\mathrm{v}} = c_{\\mathrm{d}}\n$$\nNow, we solve for the flux $J$:\n$$\n-\\frac{J}{D} L = c_{\\mathrm{d}} - c_{\\mathrm{v}}\n$$\n$$\nJ L = D (c_{\\mathrm{v}} - c_{\\mathrm{d}})\n$$\nThis yields the derived expression for the steady-state one-dimensional glucose flux:\n$$\nJ = D \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{v}} - c_{\\mathrm{d}}}{L}\n$$\nThis expression is physically consistent: the flux is proportional to the diffusivity $D$ and the concentration difference ($c_{\\mathrm{v}} - c_{\\mathrm{d}}$), and inversely proportional to the thickness of the transport barrier $L$. Since $c_{\\mathrm{v}} > c_{\\mathrm{d}}$, the flux $J$ is positive, correctly indicating flow in the positive $x$-direction.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $J$. First, we must convert all given quantities to a consistent system of units, specifically SI base units ($\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{s}$, $\\mathrm{mol}$).\n\nThe given values are:\n$D = 3 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{/s}$\n$L = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 6 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$c_{\\mathrm{v}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n$c_{\\mathrm{d}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n\nThe concentration unit must be converted from $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ to $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$. The conversion factor is $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n$$\n1\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1} = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{1\\,\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\n$$\nTherefore, the boundary concentrations in SI units are:\n$c_{\\mathrm{v}} = 5 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$c_{\\mathrm{d}} = 2 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for flux $J$:\n$$\nJ = (3 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{/s}) \\frac{(5 - 2)\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}}{6 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n$$\nJ = (3 \\times 10^{-10}) \\frac{3}{6 \\times 10^{-4}} \\,\\frac{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}{\\mathrm{s}} \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{m}^{3}} \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\nThe units combine to $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as required.\n$$\nJ = \\frac{9 \\times 10^{-10}}{6 \\times 10^{-4}} \\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nJ = 1.5 \\times \\frac{10^{-10}}{10^{-4}} \\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nJ = 1.5 \\times 10^{(-10 - (-4))} \\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nJ = 1.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid because it is scientifically grounded in established principles of biomechanics and physical chemistry, is well-posed with all necessary information and conditions provided for a unique solution, and is stated using objective and unambiguous language. We proceed with the solution, which is structured into the three tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation and Evaluation of Swelling Pressure $\\Pi$**\n\nThe swelling pressure $\\Pi$ of the nucleus pulposus (NP) arises from the osmotic imbalance between the charged gel and the external saline bath. This is governed by Donnan equilibrium. The provided relations are for electroneutrality inside the NP, $c_{i}^{+} - c_{i}^{-} = c_{f}$, and for equilibrium of the monovalent salt, $c_{i}^{+}c_{i}^{-} = c_{s}^{2}$. Here, $c_{i}^{+}$ and $c_{i}^{-}$ are the mobile cation and anion concentrations within the NP, $c_{f}$ is the fixed charge density (FCD), and $c_{s}$ is the salt concentration in the external bath.\n\nTo derive the expression for $\\Pi$, we first need to find the total internal mobile ion concentration, $c_{i}^{+} + c_{i}^{-}$. We solve the system of two equations. From the electroneutrality condition, we express the cation concentration as $c_{i}^{+} = c_{i}^{-} + c_{f}$. Substituting this into the ion product equilibrium equation yields:\n$$ (c_{i}^{-} + c_{f}) c_{i}^{-} = c_{s}^{2} $$\n$$ (c_{i}^{-})^{2} + c_{f}c_{i}^{-} - c_{s}^{2} = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for the internal anion concentration $c_{i}^{-}$. Applying the quadratic formula and selecting the physically meaningful positive root gives:\n$$ c_{i}^{-} = \\frac{-c_{f} + \\sqrt{c_{f}^{2} - 4(1)(-c_{s}^{2})}}{2} = \\frac{-c_{f} + \\sqrt{c_{f}^{2} + 4c_{s}^{2}}}{2} $$\nWe can then find the internal cation concentration $c_{i}^{+}$:\n$$ c_{i}^{+} = c_{i}^{-} + c_{f} = \\frac{-c_{f} + \\sqrt{c_{f}^{2} + 4c_{s}^{2}}}{2} + c_{f} = \\frac{c_{f} + \\sqrt{c_{f}^{2} + 4c_{s}^{2}}}{2} $$\nThe sum of the mobile ion concentrations is therefore:\n$$ c_{i}^{+} + c_{i}^{-} = \\left(\\frac{c_{f} + \\sqrt{c_{f}^{2} + 4c_{s}^{2}}}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{-c_{f} + \\sqrt{c_{f}^{2} + 4c_{s}^{2}}}{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{c_{f}^{2} + 4c_{s}^{2}} $$\nThe osmotic swelling pressure $\\Pi$ is given by the van 't Hoff law, based on the difference in total mobile ion concentration between the inside and the outside of the NP:\n$$ \\Pi = R T \\left[ (c_{i}^{+} + c_{i}^{-}) - 2c_{s} \\right] $$\nSubstituting the expression for the sum $c_{i}^{+} + c_{i}^{-}$, we arrive at the desired relationship for swelling pressure:\n$$ \\Pi = R T \\left( \\sqrt{c_{f}^{2} + 4c_{s}^{2}} - 2c_{s} \\right) $$\nNext, we evaluate $\\Pi$ for the two given FCD values. First, we must convert all concentrations to SI units ($\\mathrm{mol/m^{3}}$) to obtain pressure in Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$).

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the pore fluid pressure from the fundamental principles specified. Then, this PDE is solved subject to the given initial and boundary conditions to find the spatiotemporal distribution of pore pressure. From this, the overall sample strain and the degree of consolidation, $U(t)$, are calculated. Finally, the equation $U(t_{90}) = 0.90$ is solved to determine the required time, $t_{90}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Equation**\n\nWe model the intervertebral disc as a one-dimensional slab of thickness $h$, with the spatial coordinate $z$ ranging from $-h/2$ to $h/2$. The model is based on the following principles:\n\n*   **Conservation of Mass:** For an intrinsically incompressible solid and fluid, the rate of change of volumetric strain, $\\varepsilon_{zz}$, must be balanced by the divergence of the relative fluid-solid flux, $w_z = v^f_z - v^s_z$. In one dimension, this continuity equation is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial w_z}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\n    where $\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\partial u_z / \\partial z$ is the infinitesmal strain of the solid matrix, and $u_z$ is the solid phase displacement.\n\n*   **Linear Momentum Balance and Effective Stress:** In the quasistatic limit, the total stress, $\\sigma_{zz}$, is constant throughout the tissue thickness and is equal to the applied compressive stress, $\\sigma_0$. The total stress is supported by both the solid matrix (effective stress, $\\sigma^e_{zz}$) and the pore fluid (pressure, $p$):\n    $$ \\sigma_{zz}(z,t) = \\sigma^e_{zz}(z,t) + p(z,t) = \\sigma_0 \\quad (\\text{for } t > 0) $$\n\n*   **Constitutive Law for the Solid Matrix:** The solid matrix is assumed to be linearly elastic. The effective stress is related to the strain by the aggregate modulus, $H_A$:\n    $$ \\sigma^e_{zz} = H_A \\varepsilon_{zz} $$\n    Combining this with the effective stress principle yields the strain in terms of pore pressure:\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t) = \\frac{\\sigma_0 - p(z,t)}{H_A} $$\n\n*   **Constitutive Law for Fluid Flow (Darcy's Law):** The relative flux of the fluid through the porous solid matrix is driven by the gradient of the pore pressure, with hydraulic permeability $k$:\n    $$ w_z = -k \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} $$\n\nBy substituting the constitutive laws into the continuity equation, we derive the governing PDE. First, differentiate Darcy's law with respect to $z$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial w_z}{\\partial z} = -k \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2} $$\nNext, differentiate the strain expression with respect to time $t$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0 - p}{H_A}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{H_A} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} $$\nSubstituting these into the continuity equation $\\frac{\\partial w_z}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{\\partial \\varepsilon_{zz}}{\\partial t}$ gives:\n$$ -k \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2} = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{H_A} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\\right) \\implies \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = H_A k \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2} $$\nThis is the one-dimensional diffusion (or consolidation) equation, where the hydraulic diffusivity is $D = H_A k$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2} $$\n\n**2. Solution of the PDE**\n\nThe PDE must be solved with the following initial and boundary conditions:\n*   **Initial Condition:** At $t=0$, the step load $\\sigma_0$ is applied. The fluid has not had time to move, so it bears the entire load. Thus, the initial pore pressure is uniform and equal to the applied stress: $p(z, 0) = \\sigma_0$ for $z \\in (-h/2, h/2)$.\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The slab has double-drained boundaries, meaning the pore pressure is zero at the surfaces for all time $t0$: $p(-h/2, t) = 0$ and $p(h/2, t) = 0$.\n\nThe solution to this standard PDE problem, using the method of separation of variables, is a Fourier series:\n$$ p(z, t) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} A_m \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2m+1)\\pi z}{h}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2m+1)^2\\pi^2 D t}{h^2}\\right) $$\nThe Fourier coefficients $A_m$ are determined from the initial condition:\n$$ A_m = \\frac{2}{h}\\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\sigma_0 \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2m+1)\\pi z}{h}\\right) dz = \\frac{4\\sigma_0(-1)^m}{(2m+1)\\pi} $$\nThus, the pore pressure distribution is:\n$$ p(z, t) = \\frac{4\\sigma_0}{\\pi} \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^m}{2m+1} \\cos\\left(\\frac{(2m+1)\\pi z}{h}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2m+1)^2\\pi^2 D t}{h^2}\\right) $$\n\n**3. Degree of Consolidation, $U(t)$**\n\nThe degree of consolidation, $U(t)$, is the ratio of the creep strain at time $t$ to the final asymptotic strain $\\varepsilon_\\infty$. The macroscopic strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ is the average strain over the slab's thickness:\n$$ \\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\varepsilon_{zz}(z,t) dz = \\frac{1}{h} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\frac{\\sigma_0 - p(z,t)}{H_A} dz = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{H_A} - \\frac{1}{H_A h} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} p(z,t) dz $$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, $p(z,t) \\to 0$, and the asymptotic strain is $\\varepsilon_\\infty = \\sigma_0 / H_A$.\nThe degree of consolidation is then:\n$$ U(t) = \\frac{\\varepsilon(t)}{\\varepsilon_\\infty} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sigma_0 h} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} p(z,t) dz $$\nIntegrating the series for $p(z,t)$ from $-h/2$ to $h/2$ gives:\n$$ U(t) = 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m+1)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2m+1)^2\\pi^2 D t}{h^2}\\right) $$\n\n**4. Calculation of $t_{90}$**\n\nIt is standard to define a non-dimensional time factor, $T_v$, based on the maximum drainage path length, $H_{dr}$. For a slab of thickness $h$ drained at both ends, the longest drainage path is from the center to a surface, so $H_{dr} = h/2$.\n$$ T_v = \\frac{D t}{H_{dr}^2} = \\frac{D t}{(h/2)^2} = \\frac{4Dt}{h^2} $$\nIn terms of $T_v$, the degree of consolidation is:\n$$ U(T_v) = 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m+1)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2m+1)^2\\pi^2 T_v}{4}\\right) $$\nWe are tasked with finding $t_{90}$, the time at which $U(t_{90}) = 0.90$. This is equivalent to finding the universal value of the time factor, $T_{v,90}$, that yields $U=0.90$, and then solving for time.\nThe equation $U(T_{v,90}) = 0.90$ needs to be solved for $T_{v,90}$. The series converges very rapidly. Using only the first term ($m=0$):\n$$ 0.90 \\approx 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 T_{v,90}}{4}\\right) \\implies T_{v,90} \\approx -\\frac{4}{\\pi^2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.1 \\pi^2}{8}\\right) \\approx 0.848 $$\nThis value is a well-established constant in consolidation theory. Higher-order terms are negligible for this calculation.\nWith $T_{v,90} = 0.848$, we can find $t_{90}$:\n$$ t_{90} = \\frac{T_{v,90} H_{dr}^2}{D} = \\frac{0.848 (h/2)^2}{H_A k} = \\frac{0.848 \\, h^2}{4 H_A k} $$\nThis is the final formula for implementation. The applied stress $\\sigma_0$ does not affect the time constant of consolidation, only the magnitude of the final strain.\n\n**5. Algorithm for Solution**\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1. For each test case, the parameters $h$ (m), $k$ (m$^4\\,$N$^{-1}\\,$s$^{-1}$), and $H_A$ (Pa) are provided.\n2. The consolidation time $t_{90}$ is computed using the derived formula:\n   $$ t_{90} = \\frac{0.212 \\, h^2}{H_A k} $$\n   where the constant is $0.212 = 0.848 / 4$.\n3. The result for each case is rounded to three significant figures.\n4. The final results are collected into a list and formatted as specified.",
