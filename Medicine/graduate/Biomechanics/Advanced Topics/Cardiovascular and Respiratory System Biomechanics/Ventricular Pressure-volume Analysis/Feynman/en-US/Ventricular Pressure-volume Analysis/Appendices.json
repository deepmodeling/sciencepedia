The End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship (ESPVR) is given as a linear function. The end-systolic pressure, $P_{es}$, is determined by the end-systolic elastance, $E_{es}$, and the difference between the end-systolic volume, $ESV$, and the volume-axis intercept, $V_0$. This relationship is expressed as:\n    $$P_{es} = E_{es} (ESV - V_0)$$\n\n2.  The arterial load is characterized by the arterial elastance, $E_a$, which is defined as the ratio of end-systolic pressure to the stroke volume, $SV$.\n    $$E_a = \\frac{P_{es}}{SV}$$\n    This can be rearranged to express $P_{es}$ in terms of the arterial properties:\n    $$P_{es} = E_a \\cdot SV$$\n\n3.  The stroke volume, $SV$, is defined as the volume of blood ejected during one cardiac cycle, which is the difference between the end-diastolic volume, $EDV$, and the end-systolic volume, $ESV$.\n    $$SV = EDV - ESV$$\n\nThe principle of ventricular-arterial coupling at steady state implies that the end-systolic pressure generated by the ventricle must equal the end-systolic pressure sustained by the arterial system. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for $P_{es}$:\n$$E_{es} (ESV - V_0) = E_a \\cdot SV$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with three unknowns ($P_{es}$, $ESV$, $SV$). However, we can substitute the expression for $SV$ from the third definition into our coupled equation to obtain a single equation with a single unknown, $ESV$.\n$$E_{es} (ESV - V_0) = E_a (EDV - ESV)$$\n\nThe next step is to solve this linear equation for $ESV$. We expand both sides of the equation:\n$$E_{es} \\cdot ESV - E_{es} \\cdot V_0 = E_a \\cdot EDV - E_a \\cdot ESV$$\n\nNow, we collect all terms involving $ESV$ on one side of the equation and all other terms on the opposite side:\n$$E_{es} \\cdot ESV + E_a \\cdot ESV = E_a \\cdot EDV + E_{es} \\cdot V_0$$\n\nFactoring out $ESV$ on the left-hand side yields:\n$$ESV (E_{es} + E_a) = E_a \\cdot EDV + E_{es} \\cdot V_0$$\n\nFinally, we isolate $ESV$ by dividing by the term $(E_{es} + E_a)$:\n$$ESV = \\frac{E_a \\cdot EDV + E_{es} \\cdot V_0}{E_{es} + E_a}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values: $E_{es} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{mL}$, $V_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, $EDV = 140\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, and $E_a = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$ESV = \\frac{(1.2)(140) + (2.0)(10)}{2.0 + 1.2}$$\n$$ESV = \\frac{168 + 20}{3.2}$$\n$$ESV = \\frac{188}{3.2}$$\n$$ESV = 58.75\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nWith the value of $ESV$ determined, we can now calculate the stroke volume, $SV$, using its definition:\n$$SV = EDV - ESV$$\n$$SV = 140 - 58.75$$\n$$SV = 81.25\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the end-systolic pressure, $P_{es}$.

The information regarding the EDPVR, while not directly used in the requested calculation, provides context for the diastolic filling process that establishes the end-diastolic volume and does not introduce contradictions. The problem is thus valid.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe objective is to find an expression for the stroke volume, $SV$, by coupling the ventricular model with the arterial load model. This is achieved by enforcing consistency at the end-systolic point of the cardiac cycle, where the ventricle's pressure must equal the pressure in the arterial system.\n\nThe end-systolic pressure, $P_{es}$, is described from two perspectives:\n1.

To obtain an expression for $SV$ in terms of the initial state of filling, the end-diastolic volume ($EDV$), we use the fundamental definition of stroke volume:\n$$SV = EDV - V_{es}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this definition to express $V_{es}$ in terms of $EDV$ and $SV$:\n$$V_{es} = EDV - SV$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $V_{es}$ into the coupled pressure equation:\n$$E_{a} \\cdot SV = E_{es}\\,((EDV - SV) - V_{0})$$\n\nThe task is now to solve this equation for $SV$. We expand the right-hand side:\n$$E_{a} \\cdot SV = E_{es} \\cdot EDV - E_{es} \\cdot SV - E_{es} \\cdot V_{0}$$\n\nNext, we collect all terms involving $SV$ on one side of the equation:\n$$E_{a} \\cdot SV + E_{es} \\cdot SV = E_{es} \\cdot EDV - E_{es} \\cdot V_{0}$$\n\nFactoring out $SV$ on the left-hand side and $E_{es}$ on the right-hand side yields:\n$$SV\\,(E_{a} + E_{es}) = E_{es}\\,(EDV - V_{0})$$\n\nFinally, by dividing by the term $(E_{a} + E_{es})$, we arrive at the derived expression for stroke volume as a function of $EDV$, $E_{es}$, $E_a$, and $V_0$:\n$$SV(EDV) = \\frac{E_{es}}{E_{es} + E_{a}}(EDV - V_{0})$$\n\nThe problem asks for the change in stroke volume, $\\Delta SV$, when the end-diastolic volume changes from $EDV_1$ to $EDV_2$.\n$$\\Delta SV = SV(EDV_{2}) - SV(EDV_{1})$$\n\nUsing the derived expression for $SV(EDV)$:\n$$\\Delta SV = \\frac{E_{es}}{E_{es} + E_{a}}(EDV_{2} - V_{0}) - \\frac{E_{es}}{E_{es} + E_{a}}(EDV_{1} - V_{0})$$\n\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{E_{es}}{E_{es} + E_{a}}$:\n$$\\Delta SV = \\frac{E_{es}}{E_{es} + E_{a}} \\left[ (EDV_{2} - V_{0}) - (EDV_{1} - V_{0}) \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta SV = \\frac{E_{es}}{E_{es} + E_{a}} (EDV_{2} - V_{0} - EDV_{1} + V_{0})$$\n$$\\Delta SV = \\frac{E_{es}}{E_{es} + E_{a}} (EDV_{2} - EDV_{1})$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression for $\\Delta SV$.\nGiven:\n- $E_{es} = 2.2\\,\\mathrm{mmHg/mL}$\n- $E_{a} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mmHg/mL}$\n- $EDV_{1} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- $EDV_{2} = 140\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n\nThe change in end-diastolic volume is $\\Delta EDV = EDV_2 - EDV_1 = 140\\,\\mathrm{mL} - 120\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\Delta SV$:\n$$\\Delta SV = \\frac{2.2}{2.2 + 1.6} (140 - 120)$$\n$$\\Delta SV = \\frac{2.2}{3.8} (20)$$\n$$\\Delta SV \\approx 0.578947368... \\times 20$$\n$$\\Delta SV \\approx 11.578947... \\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta SV \\approx 11.58\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThis result demonstrates the Frank-Starling mechanism: an increase in preload (end-diastolic volume) leads to an increase in stroke volume, given that ventricular contractility ($E_{es}$) and afterload ($E_a$) remain constant.",
